<OPENER><SALUTE>Reader.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Bout <HI>18</HI> Moneths agoe I did write and publish. The Fa∣mous History of <HI>Don Belli∣anis</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> or The Ho∣nour of Chivalry in three Parts; In my Preface to the Reader I gaue an ac∣count of most of the Histo∣ries that are Printed and published in our <HI>English</HI> Tongue, I did recommend them in general to thy reading, but <HI>I</HI> was more par∣ticular in my recommendations of one entitled, The Seven Wise Masters, for <HI>I</HI> placed it in the Front na∣ming it the first of all others. It being of so great e∣steem in <HI>Ireland,</HI> that next to the Horn-book and knowledge of Letters, Children are in general put to read in it, and I know that only by that Book severall have Learned to read well, so great is the pleasure that young and old take in reading thereof.</P>
<P>Since my writting that Book, I chanced to meet with an old Book entitled, The History of Prince <HI>E∣rastus</HI> in <HI>French,</HI> and upon reading some part of it, <HI>I</HI> found it to be not only The History of <HI>Erastus,</HI> but also of The Seven Wise Masters of <HI>Rome;</HI> and to con∣teine all those Stories that are in the former Book of
<PB REF="3"/> the seven Wise Masters; I compared them one with an other and saw that though the several Stories were a∣like, yet my <HI>French</HI> book was much the better, being larger and conteining more variety of Stories then the <HI>English</HI> one which was not only very short in the Sub∣stance but also so old in the language that it was hardly good sence: <HI>I</HI> therefore thought it might be worth my while to Translate and print this <HI>French</HI> book; where∣fore <HI>I</HI> fell to work and have now perfected it to my great cost and trouble, my cost hath been extraordinary in the Pictures, for I have bestowed more on this book then are in any book of this bigness in <HI>English;</HI> so that the Rea∣der may read every particular of all the Histories in Picture; and indeed Picture is not only convenient, but necessary in all Histories of this nature there is so great affinity between them, that Picture is said to be Dumb or silent History &amp; History to be speaking Picture there being a Poetical Art <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be used in both, <HI>Pictoribus at∣que Poetis.</HI> This book being thus chargable to me, <HI>I</HI> hope the Reader will consider me in the price, if the former were so well accepted, <HI>I</HI> doubt not but this will be as well received <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as it exceed, that in price so <HI>I</HI> do assure thee it exceeds that in w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> hast now all that was ever written on this subject in any language what∣soever for <HI>I</HI> have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Translated the <HI>French</HI> book, but also compared it with the Originall in <HI>Italian,</HI> and added to that all that hath been written in <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>We have several books of this nature in <HI>English,</HI> viz <HI>Novels,</HI> but they are all trans<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>, and though more neat and modeish, yet come far short in worth and sub∣stance to this; none is in any respect so like this as one of my own composition, it is called <HI>The Unlucky Citi∣zen;</HI> and in every respect much like this, for in this
<PB REF="3"/> of <HI>Erastustis</HI> an <HI>Unlucky</HI> or <HI>Unfortunate</HI> Prince, (I may well Term him so, that for several days together expected when he should be led to the Gallows and executed for a fact which he was Innocent of;) so in that is an <HI>Unlucky</HI> or <HI>Unfortunate</HI> man, as you may at large read in that Story and both this book and that are Stored with variety of Examples and Histories, and both alike adorned with Picture. In the conclusion of this book the Maligne influences of the Stars being past, our <HI>Unlucky</HI> or <HI>Unfortunate</HI> Prince, is cleered from the Crime for which he was accused, and is Justified to all the world; being thereby in a very good and happy con∣dition: and our <HI>Unlucky</HI> or <HI>Unfortunate</HI> Citizen hath good hopes that the Maligne influence of his Stars are over, and that his condition will be for the future pros∣perous and succesful, or at the least more screen then for∣merly, however <HI>Fiat Dei Voluntas.</HI> Although this book of Prince <HI>Erastus</HI> is as compleatly finished as you can ex∣pect is; yet that of the <HI>Unlucky Citizen</HI> is not, for I intend suddenly to prosecute the Story not only of my many misfortunes, but to furnish it with more variety of <HI>Novels</HI> or <HI>Examples;</HI> neither shall it be wanting of <HI>Precepts</HI> as well as <HI>Presidents,</HI> and such as shall be Profitable, and of good and generall use for Readers of any quality; so that I question not, but it will be worthy thy Perusall</P>

<P>This Lady had acquainted an old <HI>Matrona</HI> with her Amours who had informed the Soldier that it was his god fortune to be loved by such a Lady; he being a true S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ry well pleased with this hopeful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>us:</HI> and nothing was want∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Conjuncti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> but an opportunity, which was now come by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he absence of the Old man, of which the Soldier having noti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e he according to orders walked be∣fore the Gate of the house that Evening, expecting ad∣mittance.</P>
<P>The hu band having st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d thereabouts all day, at night returned h me, and found the Soldier attending which caused him to suspect the occasion, and his sus∣pition was confirmed when he came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the house and sound a banquet prepared, and his wife ready to re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ive her Champion She was so surprized at her h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>band app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arance, that she could not make him any reasonable answ r to the many questions he propounded wher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore his passion being raised against her he resol∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> revenged on her, which he thus effects; he strip'd her naked and so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d her to a Pond in the middle wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f he ty'd her fast to a Post, thinking by that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat heat that had occasioned her malady and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>

<P>The Soldier having worn out his patience with atten¦dance, went to the old womans who had been his broak∣er in this intended Merchandize; and tells her of his fruitless attendance she wonders at it and presently goes back with him to the house, where having a Key she en∣ters the Gate, and leaving the Soldier in an outer Court went towards the house where she saw the young Lady in the Pond in the manner her husband had left her. After some small Dialogue, whereby they both under∣stood how the State of their affairs stood; the young La∣dy having still a mind to enjoy her Gallant, it was a∣greed that the old one should unstrip and stand in her stead, whilest she went to her Lover. The young woman being dressed in the Old womans cloathes went to the Soldier, who at first took her to be the <HI>Matron,</HI> but by her speech finding it to be otherwise, he soon enjoyed those pleasures they had so long desired.</P>
<P>The old Gentleman who was gone to bed could not sleep for thinking of that nights adventure, and believing that he was not sufficiently revenged on his wife he resolves on a further, and leaving his bed goes down to the place where he left his wife, and utters outragious speeches against her, which the old woman who was there, thought was best not to answer but to remain si∣lent; at which he was so, enraged that having a Knife in one hand he took her by the nose and cut it off, throw∣ing it at her face, and wishing her to present it to her Lover, he returns to bed. Soon after the Lady having taken leave of her young man, returnes to the old wo∣man; who although almost dead with her wound gives her an account of her misfortune she hears this Story with admiration, esteeming her self doubly happy in ha∣ving enjoyed her friends love, and escaped her hus∣bnads fury: and now she comforts the old woman by
<PB REF="5"/> promiscing her a great reward. This pacified her, and the young woman believing that the worst was past &amp; that better was to come, unty'd the old one, and again took her place in the water, where having contriv'd how to mannage her matter so as to come off with honour; she thus plaid her trick. Believing that her husband was within hearing as indeed he was, She with a Low voice makes a heavy complaint against him that had so w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ongd his innocent and chast wife, and then she Im∣plores the Assistance of <HI>Diana</HI> and all the other Goddess∣es of Chastity and Marriage to vindicate her and that they would shew some example on her, to demonstrate her Chastity; and if they pleased to be so gracious to her to restore that former Beauty which her husband had deprived her of, by rash &amp; unhumane cutting off her nose. This was the sum of her complaint &amp; prayer, &amp; then continuing for some time silent she at length brake forth into lowd exclaimations of joy &amp; thanksgiving to the heavenly powers for her restoration, calling to her husband to come and see the token of her innocence: <HI>He</HI> being amazed at this discourse was resolved to try the truth, &amp; riseing out of his bed lighted a candle, went down and comes to his wife, and beholding her face finds it whole and sound: whereat standing amazed he began to detest his rashness and fear heavens vengeance and deprecating the wickedness of his impious fury; he loos∣eth his most chast wife and brings her again to her bed, she by this means recovering both her nose &amp; the affection of her husband. And now Reader let this Story suf∣fice as the first Dish of meat you are to have at this ban∣quet, which <HI>I</HI> hope will please your pallet; wherefore I pray fall too and much good may it do you</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF PRINCE ERASTUS Son to the EMPEROUR DIOCLESIAN And those famous PHILOSOPHERS CALLED THE Seven Wise Masters OF ROME.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> The Emperor <HI>Dioclesian</HI> delivers his Son <HI>Erastus,</HI> to seven Philosophers to be instructed in all the Arts, and Sciences. The Empress the Mother of <HI>Erastus</HI> dyes.</HEAD>
<P>ONE Thousand and forty years after the foun∣dation of the Citty of <HI>Rome,</HI> the Emperour <HI>Dioclesian,</HI> a wise and powerful Prince, reigned in
<PB N="2" REF="7"/> that Superb and Tryumphant City, he being mar∣ried to a very fair and virtuous Princess: had by her a Son who was so well proportioned, and of so exquisite beauty, that every one concluded him to be more Divine than Humain; in such manner that the affection which all the world had for the singu∣larities and graces of this young Prince, caused that the name of <HI>Erastus</HI> was given to him, which is as much as to say amiable, and although he was but yet in his very infancy, yet in that tender age, every one concluded that in time this young Prince would arrive to very great perfection, and would not be in any thing inferiour to the other Emperours his Predecessors; and moreover there was not any Mathematician, Astrologer, Diviner, Physiognomist nor Chyromancer, who did not e∣very one respectively finde by his Art, that accord∣ing to the influences of the Caelestial Planets, this Child should be of an admirable Spirit; very sin∣gular in all Sciences, and accomplished in all man∣ner of virtue, wherein the Emperor took so great content as the Majesty of his degree, and the gran∣deur of such a Father did require; purposing on his part not to frustrate so good a Nature, but to use his endeavour to render his Son, such as the opinion of the world had conceived of him. And for asmuch as nei∣ther Illustrious blood, good Constellations, nor large Estates, are not of themselves sufficient to render a man great, if Nature be not helped and assisted by Sciences and Vertues; therefore so soon as this In∣fant <HI>Erastus</HI> was of an Age fit for to learn, the Em∣perour provided himself of the most knowing men that he could find, whereby he might be in∣structed,
<PB N="3" REF="7"/> under whose tuition he so well profited, that at the age of ten years he began to have a taste of the secrets of Phylosophy; and the good Em∣perour very well knowing that the Wisdome and Prudence of the Son, does ordinarily redound to the glory of the Father, and therefore resolving to render his Son perfect in Phylosophy, he (from amongst all the Wise Men of his Empire) made choice of seven Phylosophers, of whose skill and knowledge he had sufficient experience, that he might confidently commit the charge of such a Per∣son, who in time might succeed to the Government of the great Roman Empire The Emperour having thus delivered his Son to their charge, commanded them to instruct him with the greatest dexterity, as well in Vertue and good Manners, as in Letters, and all sorts of Sciences, that all the world might know of what a Father this young Prince was Son: and by what admirable Masters he had been in∣structed, promising to these Phylosophers very great recompences, besides the Honour they would acquire of all the World, by the good doctrine wherein they would instruct the Prince,</P>
<P>These Philosophers having with merry hearts taken this charge, by reason of the Divine Spirit which they knew to be in the young <HI>Erastus,</HI> which gave them hopes that they should attain to great honour in the execution thereof; and that they might the better execute it, they made choice of a place without the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> which was very well sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tuated, and enriched with all things necessa∣ry for the entertainment of man; for in the first place, the Air was there very temperate, there was
<PB N="4" REF="8"/> very pleasant walks, enriched with fair Fountains, the playn was very considerable, for the great num∣ber of Springs and Rivers, which running through it, at last met in a little lake, which was furnished withall sorts of fishes: there might you see all sorts of trees, as well Fruit-trees as others, and all the Fields enameled with Flowers according to the sea∣son; all accompanied with a World of Birds, who by their various Notes, rendred a continual Harmo∣ny both night and day. In this pleasant place was a Pallace built for the Prince <HI>Erastus,</HI> that he might be at some distance from the noise of the City of <HI>Rome:</HI> where he so plyed his study, that you could hardly distinguish whose affection was greatest, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ither his in Learning, or his Masters in instructing him: and although he very well knew the greatness of his quality, yet however he esteemed of no other greatness, but that which vertue should instruct him in; in such manner, that he not only surpassed the hope which had been conceived of him: but he also astonished his Masters, because they could not reach him any thing but what he soon learne with advantage. He was excellent in all the seven liberal Arts: for, first he was a good Grammarian, by that means learning to speak properly and correct∣edly. By Logick he found out reasons to discern a false proposition from a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne one, he also profited so well in Rhetorick and Oratory, that by his well speaking, he perswaded what he pleased, &amp; diswaded what he had a mind should appear ill: he was also a good Arithmetician, &amp; ready to cast up any account: by Geometry, he not only understood the dimensi∣ons of the Earth, but also many other pleasant pro∣positions:
<PB N="5" REF="8"/> as for Musick he could by his voice, make an entire and perfect Harmony; In fine he learned by Astrology, not only the course of the Stars, but also their influences, which foretel things to come: furthermore he had the knowledg of all things requisite to the perfection of man, in such manner that in ten years wherein he was under the tuition of the seven Phylosophers, he was not only a good Schollar, but surpassed in knowledg those Masters that had instructed him. Finally there did shine in him all the good graces as well of Body, as of mind, for he abhorred all Vices, and on the contrary, exercised all sorts of Vertue, passing his time in Disputations with his Masters: in which he took very much delight. About this time it was that the Empress his Mo∣the departed this life; and <HI>Erastus</HI> being adver∣tised of it, although he had as tender a love for her, as any Child could have for a Mother; yet nevertheless knowing that Death is a Natu∣ral thing, and common to all; and that all the Lamentations in the World will not restore life to those that are Dead, he spent but few sighs and tears upon her, but concluded with the Poet in this manner,</P>

The Slave having heard her discourse, although he was naturally more prone to ill then good, however con∣sidering the danger he should run into, he therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t first endeavoured to divert the Empress, and diswade her from the, unlawful love which she had for her Son in law. But in the end seeing the obstinate pur∣pose
<PB N="9" REF="11"/> of his Mistress, and again considering the large promises which she made him, he disposed himself, (let what would happen) entirely to satisfie the wicked desires of the Empress, who resolving to put her purpose into practice, began to prepare a Pre∣sent of ten shirts, very fair ones, as well in respect of the fineness of the cloath, as the richness of the embroidery; she also provided several other sorts of Linnen, wrought very curiously with flames of Gold and Silver, wrought so to the life that it seem∣ed to be true fire, intermixed with certain Letters which said, <HI>thus do I burn, for you and mourn.</HI></P>
<P>She also provided a looking-glass made of a pre∣tious stone, which represented all things as lively as any other looking-glass of Christal or Steel; and was enchased with fine Gold, so cunningly wrought, and so artificially, that it every where represented love stories: these rich things being collected, she likewise provided perfumes and essences that should, be as agreeable to the scent, as the others were to the sight, and having locked them all up in a silver Cabinet, so richly wrought, that the workmanship was of more value, then the materials, she delivered all to her trusty Slave, charging him to carry this pre∣sent to <HI>Erastus,</HI> as sent from the Emperour and her∣self, and to recommend them both to him, expresly commanding him to acquint him that she herself had wrought most of these works, and above all to shew them to him one after another, presenting her most affectionat commendation, without forg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tting to de∣clare to him the grievous pain she endur'd for his love praying him to have compassion on her, and to find the means to come to <HI>Rome</HI> that she might enjoy the the fruit of her so much desired love.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
<P>The Slave being dispatched with his rich presents went directly to the Castle where Prince <HI>Erastus</HI> with his Masters resided; by fortune he found him alone in the Garden, contemplating on the secrets of Phylosophy: he rejoyced at his good luck, being of opinion that fortune had favoured him very much, in regard he found the Prince so convenient∣ly without Company, whereby he might have the conveniency to let him see peice by peice, the beauty and richness of his present, and to have leisure to discharge himself of his whole message; and al∣though the sage discipline of the Prince, and the great continence wherewith he was reported to be endowed, might cause him to desist from prosecuting his design; yet the gayety which he then saw him in, and his Age being so propper for love affairs, put him in hopes that he should perfect the desires of the Empress his Mistress; however being cuning and crafty, he purposed to manage the affair of her affections, as he should find the young Prince af∣fected to the beauty of the present which he brought him; being thus determined, having made his reve∣rence, he presented recommendations from the Em∣perour and Empress, telling him he was expresly sent to him, to visit him, and to bring him certain pre∣sents as a remembrance, which were for the most part wrought by the Empresses own hands; who did bear as much affection to him as the Emperour himself, and although by reason of her youthfulness she was not deserving of the name of Mother: yet nevertheless she did assure him, that she had as great an affection for him, or more then if she had bore him of her body; as in time she would make ap∣pear
<PB N="11" REF="12"/> to him: and having opened the Cabinet, he took out the rich presents which the Empress <HI>Aphro∣disia</HI> had sent him: endeavouring to cause him to view them severally, but the young Prince not ha∣ving the patience to hear the Slave, &amp; less to look on the presents, with an angry Countenance thus spake to him, if these presents come from the Emperour my Father, (which <HI>I</HI> cannot believe) I am constrain∣ed to say, that he is not of such Prudence and Ver∣tue as he hath been esteemed for: for does he not well know, that these Curiosities and Delica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es are direct contrary to the study wherein he hath em∣ployed me, and which I shall not forsake these Bawbles belong to Women and not to Men of his degree and quality. I hope his new wise h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> altered the temper he was of; as I read of so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Women, who have over-ruled wise and vali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: as for my part <HI>I</HI> shall not receive these presen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by no means, therefore carry them back, and say to the Emperour my Father, that he must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end me o∣ther presents, if he would have me accept of them; and say as much to the Empress, whom on my be∣half, you may thank for the good will which she bears to me; and that I may not be ungrateful to her, that I can do no less, but freely tell her, that it would more redound to her profit and honour, to govern her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouse well, then to loose so much preci∣ous time in these vain idle works, from whence she can reap no honour, but blame. The Slave being ravished with the great continence of Prince <HI>Erastus,</HI> and much more with his wise discourse, knew not what to say, and less what to do, for to carry back the presents he durst not, fearing he should highly
<PB N="12" REF="13"/> offend the Empress his Mistress, and how to cause the Prince <HI>Erastus</HI> to accept of them, he knew not, but on the contrary he found he had no opportunity to discover the principal point for which he was sent: so that not being able to speak one word, he re∣mained as in a maze. But the seven Phylosophers came to him in good time, who having understood as well of the Prince <HI>Erastus,</HI> as of the Slave, all that had passed between them, having first commended the Constancy and Magnaminity of their Schollar, for refusing things so delectable to the eye, as being repugnant to their Phylosophical severity, yet never∣theless perswaded him to accept the presents which the slave said were sent as well from the Emperour as the Empress, that he might not anger or displease either, and this he at last though unwillngly assent∣ed to. The Slave being thus dispatched, entered into new considerations what he should do with the Empress, for to let her know the business in the ve∣ry manner as it had passed, he feared would put her out of her wits, and that he should be accounted an ignorant fellow, and knew not how to perform the charge that had been given him, and of which at the beginning he had given so good hopes: and ne∣ver the less seeing himself frustrate of all means to accomplish his desires, he foresaw that instead of great rewards which he hoped for (if the matters should take effect) there was danger that the Em∣press might doe him some mischeif, and having a great while considered what he had best to do, he in the end resolved to keep his Mistress in good hopes to get what he could from her, and keep him∣self in her favour. And now being come to
<PB N="13" REF="13"/> her presence, he with a smileing countenance made his obeysance, and told her quite contra∣ry to what had passed between him and the Prince <HI>Erastus,</HI> assuring her that the Prince had received her present with very great affection, and and for a greater expression of love, had very amorously kissed every particular peice that had been present∣ed, &amp; had expresly charged him to give the Empress a thousand thanks, and on his behalf to entreat her not to displace him from her heart until his return to <HI>Rome,</HI> which he would hasten as much as possible, and by all means to accomplish. The poor Princess giving credit to the Slave, and believing the loue of <HI>Erastus</HI> to be greater towards her, than the Slave had reported, having a good opinion of her beauty, did so enflame the fire which was al∣ready Kindled in her heart, that out of the abun∣dance of love, without regarding her degree and qua∣lity, she gave great presents to the Slave, to let him know how great an esteem she had for him, in regard of the pains he had taken in his late nego∣tiation, making him great and magnificent promises, if he should manage her affairs so as she might at∣tain to her desired wishes: and although the Slave had lost all hopes of performing any, thing by reason of the great continance which he saw in the Prince <HI>Erastus;</HI> yet nevertheless that he might gain some∣what on the Empress, he nourished h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r hopes with a certain issue of her design: in such a mnnner that this poor and too credulous Princess, seeing the sweetness of her desires too long d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yed, retired into her Cabinet, not permitting any body to accompany her;

<P>SUpper time being come, and the Empress being seated at the Table with the Emperour, she was more melancholly then ordinary, and took no plea∣sure in the pastime that was presented to her: but sighed so vehemently, that the Emperour took notice of it, and being troubled, asked her the cause of her sighing, to which she answered; that the remem∣brance of a horrible dream which had hapned about break of day, was the cause of her present sadness: and indeed she said true, for it was <HI>Erastus</HI> whom she had seen in this Vision, although she had told it to be a horrible Serpent; the Emperour then being willing to put this Fancy out of her mind, told her that she must give no credit to Dreams, being things without substance, that vanish away, whereupon she put on a mercy countenance, and entertained the Em∣perour as she was wont, until it was bed time, which occasioned more pain to this poor Princess, the Em∣perour for his part went to sleep, but the Empress
<PB N="16" REF="16"/> could not close her eyes for thinking of her affecti∣on to <HI>Erastus</HI> being of opinion that her affairs ha∣ving had so prosperous a beginning, she should lose noe time or occasion to bring it to that end so much desired by her: and ruminating all the night on what means she should use to perfect her desires: sometimes she doubted that the Slave was insuffici∣ent, for an enterprise of so high a consequence; o∣therwise, she could not find any way possible to speak with <HI>Erastus,</HI> because he was at <HI>Rome,</HI> and al∣wayes accompanied with grave Phylosophers; whose doctrine she very well knew was contrary to her ap∣petite. In conclusion she resolved to speak to him by Letters and Presents, and so soon as the day be∣gan to appear, that night in the opinion of the Em∣press being longer than usual, she arose, and being retired alone into her Cabinet, she writ this Letter which followeth.</P>
<Q>THE Empress <HI>Aphrodicia</HI> to her Friend <HI>Erastas</HI> health, I doubt not but these presents will astonish you, that <HI>I</HI> without respecting your grandeur, have bin so bold to write to you, without considering that <HI>I</HI> pre∣sent to your fair eyes a thing so ill dictated as these pre∣sents: and to cause your mouth so accustomed to all good learning, to read this Letter destitute of all eloquence: however, <HI>I</HI> have not forborn putting Pen to paper, be∣ing assured that your sublime spirit will measure my writeing according to the affection from whence it pro∣ceedeth, and that you will have a greater esteem for it, than if all the Oratory had been employed to assist me with Eloquence upon this occasion: for according to the Poet, <HI>Love hides many faults,</HI> and to tell you
<PB N="17" REF="16"/> truly how it is: this God hath so fettered me that to obey him, I have been forced thus to write to you, praying you to receive and entertain it with a plea∣sant countenance, believing that it is not simply paper, but my self: who with all my affection am transform∣ed into it, and <HI>I</HI> wish I were personally present with you, assuring my self th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t I should enjoy the fruit of my de∣sires: which <HI>I</HI> hope are long by word of mouth to dis∣cover to you; for it is impossible that your knowing spirit should not be acquainted with the secrets of my heart, which is more yours then my own, for you are Lord of it, so as you will please to love that which with all her heart loves you. However if your temper cor∣responds to your name (for <HI>Erastus</HI> signifies amiable) <HI>I</HI> hold my self assured, that my recommendation shall be received, which nevertheless <HI>I</HI> present to you with all possible affection; and because <HI>I</HI> wondred at your ab∣sence at my Wedding with the Emperour. I therefore pray you to take occasion to come and see me, that you may let the World know that you are not dissatisfied with my alliance: in doing whereof which <HI>I</HI> entreat of you you shall hear openly by word of mouth the rest of my secret which only tends to your profit, honour, and greatness In the mean time to testify the perfect love which <HI>I</HI> bear to you: I send to you the most preti∣ous things which <HI>I</HI> have, being certain jewels which you shall find to be singular, not only for their beauty, and richness, but also in regard they are peices of antiquity, which my late Father gave particularly to me, being the preciest things he was Master of: and therefore <HI>I</HI> send them to you, as better deserving to en∣joy things so rare, desiring you to accept of them with
<PB N="18" REF="17"/> my heart, And as you have the report to surpass i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> every thing all other men, that you not only permi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your self to be overcome by the force of a simple woman but let her know that your love is more ardent then hers if it were possible. <HI>I</HI> wish you good health.</Q>
<P>This Letter being written and sealed, the Em∣press wrapped it up in fine cloath of Gold, with many Jewels, Pearls, Diamonds, Safers and many other pretious stones of inestimable value, and en∣closed all in a Cabinet of fine G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld, which she deli∣vered to her faithful slave: charging him to carry it to <HI>Erastus,</HI> advising him to find him alone, and ac∣company the present with speeches, proper to the intent of his message; and the slave might perform this voyage with the more bravery, she presented him with a horse, and a good some of money.</P>
<P>The Slave thus dispatched, in short time arrived at the Pallace where Prince <HI>Erastus</HI> studyed: where by good Fortune he found him alone in his studdy, and as to the matter of the present delivered his mesage as the Empress had commanded him, without pro∣ceeding further, but only to bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>commendations from his Mistress, forbearing to deliver the rest of the message, until he should understand how the Prince would accept of the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent, being of the opinion that it would be imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble for a Prince of his age to sl ght such pretious Jewels as he had brought; but <HI>Erastus</HI> having considered the rich∣ness of the present, began to consider what might be the cause of the great liberallity of the Empress, in regard that all women are naturally covetous. But having found the Letter and read the contents
<PB N="19" REF="17"/> of it, he presently had some suspition: although he could not absolutely believe love to be the cause: but however in great anger he tore the Letter into prices, and sound<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y rat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed the slave, forbidding h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m upon his life never to come into his presence, and that he should carry back the Jewels to his Mistress, and use his endeavour to diswade her from her dis∣ordinate humours. The slave being much troubled returned back to <HI>Rome,</HI> and in his way thither, he considered that if he should acquaint his Mistress of the truth of this affair, his profit would be at an end, and therefore being come into the presence of the Empress he spake thus, Madam, I do assure you that I have full and according to your intention, ex∣ecuted the charge which you were pleased to give me: and that the Prince <HI>Erastus</HI> is wholly at your dispose. True it is, that not thinking himself wor∣thy of the great present which you sent him, told me that your love was sufficient, without depriving you of so great rarieties &amp; therefore he hath return∣ed them, only keeping the Letter, which he read over and kissed more than a thousand times in my pre∣sence; and he would willingly have returned an an∣swer; but that he doubted his Masters would return presently and surpr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ze him, wherefore he in short told m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that he would suddenly come to <HI>Rome,</HI> where by word of mouth he would give you full sa∣tisf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction: beseeching you in the mean time to con∣tinue your good opinion of him. The Empress was highly contented with the slaves discourse, how∣ever she was somewhat dissatisfied, for that her pre∣sents had been return<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d without any litteral answer, but being blinded by her passion, she absolutely
<PB N="20" REF="18"/> beleived the slave, and therefore rested content∣ed her self, and highly contented him, by great riches, which she gave him earnestly, expecting the arrival of <HI>Erastus,</HI> but thinking his stay to be very long and passionately desiring his company, she devised to hasten him by the Emperours com∣mand, and therefore she sollicited him to condis∣cend that <HI>Erastus</HI> might come to <HI>Rome.</HI></P>

<P>SOON after this the Emperour and Emperess being in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed together, she began to speak of the Prince <HI>Erastus,</HI> highly commending the means which the Emperour had used, to provide Masters for him, that were so excellent as the seven Phyloso∣phers: to render him perfect in all things, and wor∣thy of the the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat Roman Empire, which Nature had provided for him; being as she said very joyful of the grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d and profit which the Prince had attained by his study, and of the advantage which all the World would receive by mean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his per∣fections, but that she had been somewhat troubled why the Prince was not present at the solemnity of her nuptials. Whereunto the Emperour replyed, that the youthfulness of the Prince, was the cause lest in an age which was inclined to pleasure, the
<PB N="21" REF="18"/> pomp and delicacies which he might see at the so∣lemnitly more than at another time, might distract, divert him from the study of Philosophy, in which he not being sufficiently grounded, all the pleasures which he might take, should turn more to his disad∣vantage than true content, if he should place his af∣fection on the pleasures that would be presented to him at <HI>Rome:</HI> and it was to be feared, that instead of the go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d affection he had to his study, he should be debauched, as it would be difficult to reduce him to that agen, wherein he well profited, that there was great hopes he would in time, be so great a pro∣ficient in all vertues, as to arrive at the highest per∣fection. All this discourse of the Emperour only served as fire and flame to consume the poor Em∣press, who already sufficiently enflamed with the love of the Prince <HI>Erastus.</HI> Whereupon taking the opportunity of this discourse of the Emperours to obtain her desires, she thus replyed to him: where∣fore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir, do you permit these great vertues to be hid∣den? and to what end is it, that your Son (for I love him as well as you) hath so well profited to r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦main alwayes in an obscure place where his vertue is unknown; wherefore do you not cause him to come to <HI>Rome,</HI> where there is so many wayes to employ his perfections, for in the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st place he will see how affairs are mananaged, he will make himself known as the Senate and People, and by that means will encrease the esteem that every one h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th for you, not only for the good usage which they have under your government but also for the great foresight w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h they shall see in you, for having provid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d for them a Prince well instructed to keep them in peace after your dis∣cease.

Or any steel that would not be softened with my speeches? I thought I might have molified the most savage and the most cruell beasts in the converse; in fine, I thought I might have overcome all the world, and you alone make no reckoning of me: Remove, re∣move this Ice which thus freezeth your heart, <HI>I</HI> beg of you not thus to despise me, me who dye for you; I lose my speech, alas my heart failes me, behold me at your feet beging of you to relieve me, at least with one word, be it what it will, and that if <HI>I</HI> can receive no other; shall very much content me. These were the words of the Empress, but let her discourse be what it would, Prince <HI>Erastus</HI> took no notice of it, whereupon she being desperate, began to sigh and Curse her fortune, which had forced her to love one who would not regard her: and nevertheless resolv∣ing,
<PB N="35" REF="27"/> let what would happen, to have her will with this young Prince; seeing perswasions would do no good, she thought to use force, but he knew well enough how to defend himself from that; for although speech wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> prohibited him, yet he might guard himself from violence, whereupon the Empress began to be so outragious, seeing her self so refused, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat changing the unbridled love which she bore to Prince <HI>Erastus,</HI> into a mortall hatred, she thus spake to him. <HI>I</HI> am resolved that you shall per∣forme my pleasure in despight of you, or I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my Clothes, and do violence to my self, and with loud Clamours I will accuse you to the Emperour, that you would force me, and then the small esteem that you have for me shall bring you to an Ignomi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious death! Therefore choose one or the other, for <HI>I</HI> am resolved no longer to be thus abused by you. The young Prince hearing the speech of the Empress, and not knowing what course to take went to the Chamber door, and began to flye, but the Empress tearing her Clothes and pulling off all her head attire, striking her head and breasts, with her fists, and running after young Prince <HI>Erastus,</HI> cryed out aloud Help, help, seize on him, seize on him, let not the Traytor escape you. Oh me wretched woman! Oh how is my life accused! Come quick∣ly, my Lord and Husband, come quickly I beseech you and stay not; behold the wickedness and Trea∣son of your Son, who would have forced me, behold how the wretch flies because he could not have his will on me; See, see, the good doctrine which the Traytors hath learned, not to vouchsafe to speak honestly to you, and without shame to aske that of
<PB N="36" REF="28"/> me, which is not Lawfull for to speak or think of, and indeed he would have forced me; come then and revenge me, and your self also, of the great out∣rage which this wicked one (who never was your Son) would have done to me: For if he had ever in the least belonged to you, he had never had the heart to think, much less to do an action so wicked. The Emperour who had run with the greatest part of his Princes and Barrons at the cry of his wicked wife; having hard what she said, and seeing his Son <HI>Era∣stus</HI> making hast all pale and trembling, being moved with great anger, comanded him to be seiz∣ed on, and put in a dungeon; absolutly believing the case to be such, as his disloyal wife had represented it: The poor young Prince, was suddenly taken bound and manacled, very strictly without speaking one word for defence, or excuse, but was in a manner confounded, as it happens to those who are surprized in a wicked action, which being seen of every one, all the world was of oppinion that he was guilty, of what the Empress had accused him; and therefore there was none so bold as to open their mouths for poor <HI>Erastus;</HI> but they had all great compassion for his fact, for he was secured in the strongest and obscure Prison in all the Castle. The Empress on her part required speedy justice a∣gainst him: In persuance whereof the Emperour re∣solving to be revenged, not only for the outrage done to his wife, but also to himself; and that he might let the people know that he had a heart e∣quall, to the Emperours his predecessours; not to spare his own blood, in the execution of justice,: he therefore caused the Counsell presently to assemble,
<PB N="37" REF="28"/> where taking his place, he passed sentence of death against his Son; comanding that within three hours he should be executed, with the most cruell and most Ignominous death, that could be imagined, the which sentence was pronounced, and intimated to young Prince <HI>Erastus:</HI> Yet nevertheless, although he plainly saw the injustice done him, and that it would not be very difficult to have sentence reward∣ed, and to Justifie himself, by relating all that had passed: Yet however being very well informed of the threatnings which the Star<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had given him, if for the space of seven dayes, he should speak one word; he chose rather to hold his peace, than to defend himself, depending upon the promise which his seven Masters had made him; whose knowledge and prudence was so well known and experienced, that although he saw himself in eminent danger of death: Yet nevertheless he had this hope, that they would easily stop the execution of this cruell sen∣tence, untill the malignity of the influence of the Stars should be passed over, which time being come he might freely speak, and defend himself against the guilt, and Ignominy; whereof he was accused. The sentence of <HI>Erastus</HI> was no sooner published in <HI>Rome,</HI> but in a moment, there was seen a very great alteration: For instead of their preperations of joy, for the entry of their young Prince; every one now hang down their heads, so that there was nothing but sadness, and melancholly throught all <HI>Rome;</HI> In the first place the poor Emperour, cryed and sighed; and with him all the Lords and Ladies, at the misfortune of Prince <HI>Erastus:</HI> In testimony whereof, all persons as well men as women, threw
<PB N="38" REF="29"/> off their rich habits, which they had put on to honor the entry of their Prince; and instead of that, every one put on mourning aparrell; in the mean time the Officers of justice, began to provide in execute the sentence of <HI>Erastus,</HI> so that every where, all went with crye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eare, to see this cruell specta∣cle: But the seven Philosophers, who were met together in counsell, to advise about <HI>Erastus,</HI> con∣cluded that <HI>Euprosigorius</HI> should first begin, and or∣der the matter so with the Emperour, that executi∣on of the sentence should be stoped for that day, and that one day after another, every one should do the like, so that each of them, causing the execution, to be delayed for one day; the fatall dayes of <HI>Erastus,</HI> would in that time be passed over, and thereupon the good Philosopher disposed him∣self to go finde the Emperour.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII. Euprosigorus</HI> the Philosopher, puts a stop to the exe∣cution of the sentence of <HI>Erastus</HI> for one day, by the example of a <HI>Roman</HI> Gentleman; who had kil∣led his beloved Dog, who had rescued his only Son from a Serpent that would have devoured him; giving too much creditto the speeches of his wife, who had told him that his son was dead.</HEAD>
<P>THe Philosopher <HI>Euprosigorus</HI> being arived at the Pallace, saw that the Emperour was walking a∣lone in the hall; no person darcing to speak one word to him, yet nevertheless he entred with much free∣dom, and great confidence; But he was no sooner in the presence, when many flocked together after him, to know if he came upon the account of <HI>Erast∣us,</HI> and what would be the issue of it; before the Philosopher had the conveniency of making his reverence to the Emperour, he looked on him, with an angry and troubled countenance, and with a high tone demanded of him from whence proceeded that rashness and presumption, to dare to appeare before him, and more especially at a time so improper, and if that were the doctrine and instruction, which he and his Companions had taught his Son, to scorne to speak, nor answer to his father, and to solicite his Mother-in-Law to so dishonest an account,
<PB N="40" REF="31"/> Nay; and to attempt to force her. But continu∣ed he, I promise you by the word of a Prince, that <HI>I</HI> will provide so sharp, and so examplary a Chastise∣ment; as well for you as for that Rascall my Son, that shall leave a perpetual memory, and shall serve as an example to posterity to cause them to take heed of Committing such felonies, toward their Lords or Princes: The Emperour having ended, the good Philosopher with a cheerfull countenance, and without the least appearance of trouble, thus answered; know Sir, that it is very ill done of any person, to Act any thing contrary to right justice, and more especially for those who are in publique imployments, and although your Majesty being endowed with great wisdom, may think that you have not erred, in your sentence against Prince <HI>E∣rastus;</HI> yet nevertheless <HI>I</HI> can boldly say, that it is impossible but there should be a fault, in giving so sudden a sentence; for every wise man ought dilli∣gently and deliberately to weight the cause, and to understand the fact very well before he proceeds to Judgment: And those persons who are fit to be Judges, ought principally to avoyd three things; that is malice, disdaine, and anger, as for the two first I shall say nothing at present, being assured that neither malice, nor disdain, did not induce you to denounce this rash sentence; but I may speak of anger, for it was that which caused you to pro∣nounce so severe a sentence; and certainly the Poet said truly</P>
<PB N="41" REF="31"/>
<Q><L>Anger by some termed Ire,</L>
<L>Springeth from the heart and fire;</L>
<L>Which, if quenched not in Season,</L>
<L>By the water of sound reason,</L>
<L>Right nor wrong, nor time nor place,</L>
<L>Can prevent its furious race.</L></Q>
<P>All these disorders Sir, have possession of your Spirit, and have moved you to a certain impetious anger, in this so important a cause, and that meerly through the speech of a simple woman; although your Majesty is not ignorant of the little reason which an angry woman is Mistress of; who for the most part suffer themselves, to be transported by their passion without inclining to any reason; so that I am assured that no good can come of it, and if you do not change your mind, I doubt it will happen to you, as it did to a <HI>Roman</HI> Gentleman, who giving to much credit to his wives perswasions killed his only Dog which he had loved above all things; of which action at last, he too late, very much repented. What was this Gentleman said the Emperour, and how was the matter: I shall tell you Sir, said the Philosopher provided that in the mean time your Majesty will be pleased to stay the execution of Prince <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>astus,</HI> so that ha∣ving heard me, if your mind shall alter, (as <HI>I</HI> hope it will) and the sentence not being executed, you may be at liberty to pronounce one more favour∣able, otherwise my desires will be in vain: There∣fore Sir if you please to stay the execution untill I have finished my discourse, and then you may do even what you please, not only with Prince <HI>Erastus,</HI> but also with me and my Companions. To this the
<PB N="30" REF="32"/> Emperour agre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d although he did certainly, believe that nothing that he could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay should cause him to change his Opinion; yet in regard he had oftentimes took grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pleasure in his learned discourse, he was content to hear him; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> commanded the execution of his Son to be d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yed for the present: The Phi∣losopher therefore taking up the discourse, thus began.</P>
<P>Some time since, there lived a Gentleman in <HI>Rome</HI> having but one Son, who bring desirous to have him well bred up as his only dear Child, caused him to be nursed in the house, and laid in his Chamber; the some Gentleman had a Dog which he had a very great esteem for, as well for his handsomeness as good properties, and he took much pleasure in him, as it was possible for any Gentleman to take in such a creature. It happened that there was a Tourna∣ment or running at Tilt, held in the publique Place in <HI>Rome;</HI> to which the Gentleman amongst others of his quality resorted: And no sooner was he gone but his wife also being as unadvised as many other woman, had a mind to go see the pleasures of this Tournement, and thereupon she went with all her Chamber-maids and damsells; and to their great misfortune the Nurse went to the Top of the house, from whence although she could not see, yet she might hear what was done at the Tilting, having only shut the Dog into the Chamber, where her Masters Son lay: This Gentlemans house being old and out of repair, there were many breeches in it even in the very room, where the Child and Dog were and that one of these holes, there at this time entered a great and horrible Serpent, which the dog
<PB N="43" REF="32"/> seeing, and that he made towards the Cradle, for the natural love which these Creatures bear to their Masters, even to hazard their lives in their defence; he slew upon the Serpent, to keep him from hurting the Child: But the one was not more furious in assaulting, then the other was in defending, and the Dog and Serpent strugling together nere the Cradle where the Child lay they over turned it; so that the Child fell to the ground, but without any harm, for the clothes that were upon were by the tumbling now underneath, and the Cradle standing on the four pomells, the Child lay as safe and as well as it had done before it was overturned: the Dog being enraged as well at the wounds he had received of the Serpent, as at the wrong which he saw was done to his young Master, threw himself with great fury upon the Serpent, who knew well enough how to defend himself; however in the end, the dog re∣mained victorious and tore the Serpent in the cruel∣est manner he could imagin, so that he was all smeer∣ed with his blood.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Nurse coming into the Chamber to see how the Child did, she had no sooner put her foot within the door, but seeing the Cra∣dle topsie turvy, and the Dog all bloody, with out looking any further, and being very cer∣taine that he who had saved the Childs life, had killed him; she began to tear her Cloa∣thes, and with outragious cryes went to entry this sad news to the Childs Mother; who un∣derstanding of the death of her Child, fell into such a passion as any one would for do the loss of such a Child, and if the Nurse expressed her
<PB N="44" REF="33"/> sorrow in tearing her cloaths, it is to be supposed that the poor Mother did not forbear doing the same to her flesh; not only she her self, but all the women of the house who had accompanyed their Mistress, encreased the lamentation, and made an in∣credible noyse with their great cryes and lamentati∣ons, not any of them having the wit to go into the Chamber, and see how it had hapned: but there they continued their out-cryes until the Gentle-man returned from the Tourney, to whom they all with tears related, not that which they had seen, but that which they had imagined by the Nurses discourse.</P>
<P>The poor Father hearing these sad tidings, more full of rage than tears, (for anger and sadness which are great passions had stopped his tears) went di∣rectly into the Chamber, where meeting the Dog and seeing him all bloody, gave absolute credit to what the woman had told him: and having his sword drawn in his hand, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e smote the Dog with such fury, that off went his head, and after he had spurned him with anger: he began to curse his fortune, and lament his Son, using great threatnings towards his Wife and the other women of his house, for the little care they had taken of his Child; and being in despair, he went towards the Cradle, which he took up to see if there were yet any parts of his Child whole, but he found him well, and without any hurt, whereupon all the Family were highly contented, as you may judge: and yet they were all astonished in that they had seen the Dog so bloody, but as they sought about the Chamber, they saw the great Ser∣pent which the Dog had tore to peices, whereupon they conjectured that the blood that was about the
<PB N="45" REF="33"/> Dog, came by reason of the combate which he had with the Serpent, in defence of the Child; which the Gentleman seeing, and being enraged that he had in anger kill'd his good Dog, he would have slain his Wife, and all the other Women of the house, who had been the cause of the Dogs death. Ah poor Dog said he, that thy friend-ship and loyalty have been so unfortunate to thee, to cause thy death instead of a recompence which thou didst deserve for so well defending my little Child. In fine, this poor Gentle∣man could not be appeased for the loss which he had caused of so faithful an annimal as his Dog was, so that every one that hard it, had pitty and grief for the Childs loss, was now converted into grief for the loss of the Dog; all which sorrow hap∣ned to this Gentle-man, for having given too much credit to his Wife, for if he had been wise, he would first have examined the matter, and accordingly have judged it, without entring into such fury, as to act a thing which caused perpetual sorrow to him with∣out any remedy. I shall conclude that this will be your case, if you give credit to the words of a sim∣ple woman, to put your Son to a Shameful death, whose cause being heard deserves rather praise than punishment and perpetual infamy; and therefore as your Majesties most humble servant, I advise you that laying aside all anger before you proceed further, you cause this action of your son to be consulted on, by wise &amp; experienc'd men, such as wil be faithful to you, &amp; that you will revoke this sentence, which your an∣ger hath caused you to pronounce. The Emperour took such notice of the Philosophers saying, that he commanded stay of the execution of the sentence,
<PB N="46" REF="34"/> until he should take further order therein; and thus was Prince <HI>Erastus</HI> defended the first day.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> The Emperor <HI>Dioclesian,</HI> by an example being induced which the Empress <HI>Aphrodicia</HI> related of a fair Pine-tree, which being old, is lopped, and then cut down to nourish a young one, which was ugly and crooked; commanded that Prince <HI>Erastus</HI> should be executed.</HEAD>
<P>THE Emperour retireing when it was late, ac∣cording to custom found the Empress alone in her Chamber very disconsolate; which much troub∣led him, for he dearly loved her, and endeavour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by all means to comfort her; but the more he essay∣ed, to please her, so much the more she sobed, so that the Emperour prayed her to be of good cheer, and that she should be satisfied: to which she reply∣ed, truly I have little cause to be contented, for the shall care you take to revenge so great an outrage, which hath not been committed against me only, but against your self; for upon this account you are as much injured as I am. It is true, I resent it more than you laying our honour more to heart than
<PB N="47" REF="34"/> you, who however ought to shew it more exempla∣rily: as yesterday you made me believe you did, but I know not who hath so suddenly caused you to revoke your sentence, and I doubt to my great trouble, if you do not take more heed to your affairs, that it will happen to you, as it did to a very fair Pine-tree, which instead of being renew∣ed, was cut up and destroyed. What Pine was this said the Emperour, and what happned about it, to which the Empress answered. A while agoe there was a Gentleman of <HI>Italy,</HI> who had a very fair Garden, wherein he took so much pleasure, that he therein planted all sorts of Herbs, and Trees, and among others he had a very fair Pine, so fair and so strait as any could be in the World, so that this Gentle-man esteemed this Pine more than all the Trees in the Garden, and thereupon he there made an arbour, taking great pleasure to remain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nder the shaddow of it for the most part of the day, whe∣ther he had a mind to read, or otherwise to pass the time. It hapned as one often sees among other Trees, that from the root of this Pine, sprung a sucker, which the Gentle-man seeing, being very much pleased at it, he commanded his Gardner to look carefully after it, hoping by this means to get an other Pine as fair as the former, and this young sucker finding the fresh Earth that was put about it, grew very well at the beginning, but being grown up so high that the branches of the first Pine kept the Sun from it: it did not grow so well as at the first, but became bent and crooked. The Gentle-man being troubled at it, asked the Gardner the cause, who answered, that the bowes of the great one,
<PB N="48" REF="35"/> gave so great a shaddow, that the young one not having the Sun and air to make it grow strait up ac∣cording to its Nature, it therefore was crooked and did not thrive, whereupon the Gentle-man com∣manded to lop the old one, and take away the branches which hindered the Sun from the young one, so the old one was lop'd all away on one side. It hapned that this Gentle-man had a voyage to make for some moneths; but before he went, he re∣commended his young Pine to the Gardner above all things, in this the Gardner did not fail, so that the Sun coming to the young one, it grew again as it had formerly done, but however it still continued crooked; on the contrary, the great one began to wither on the side it had been lopped. The Gentle∣man at his return, seeing the great Pine half dead, and knowing that these two Pines hindred one ano∣ther, and that there was little hopes of the great Pine, in regard it was so decayed, caused it to be cut up, and thus was this Tree (that had formerly been so well beloved) destroyed for the young Pines sake; which although it grew to be a great one, yet it still kept it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ill and crooked shape, which it had from the beginning: and thus will it happen to you, for having placed your Son, (if he may be called yours which <HI>I</HI> cannot believe) to the government of these seven Philosophers, you see in what case he is, they have already lopt you on one side, by the shame which they have caused you, and which is worst, being resolved to maintain and justifie it; you will in short time see a rebellion in <HI>Rome,</HI> and if you should pardon him for this out-rage in hope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his amendment, assure your self that ere long he
<PB N="49" REF="35"/> will a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>empt against your life, as he hath already done against your honour, to arrive to the Go∣vernm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt so soon as he can: and be assured that these Philosophers will put their helpin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hand to it, in hopes that they shall have the management of the affair<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Empire, and so for want of fore∣cast, you will see your self ruined by your young sucker; <HI>I</HI> shall prevent it replyed the Emperour, for I promise you that justice shall take place, and at once to revenge your honour and my own; and there∣upon he commanded that without delay the sen∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce of <HI>Erastus,</HI> should be executed on his Person.</P>

<P>DAY, brake was hardly come, when those to whom the execution of Prince <HI>Erastus</HI> was committed, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d provide for all things necessary thereunto, without loss of further time, according to the precise command of the Emperour; in the mean time the Philosopher <HI>Dimurgus,</HI> who had un∣dertook to defend the Prince for the second day,
<PB N="50" REF="36"/> lest he should be surprized, had bethought himself of all that he had to say to the Emperour, and so being ready, in the morning he came to the Cham∣ber, where by Fortune he found him coming out sooner, than ordinary, by reason of the great trouble he was in, both in body and mind, for the causes aforescited: and although the Emperour appeared to be angry, yet he being satisfied in the innocence of Prince <HI>Erastus,</HI> after he had made his usual reve∣rence, he took the boldness to say, Sir, having re∣ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved this favour of your Majesty, to be long since admitted into the service of your house: I ever knew you both of a rare spirit, and very well advised; whereby you have alwayes prudently governed the affairs of your Empire, so that I have alwayes ad∣mired the great vertues which did respectively shine in you; and a particular zeal which you alwayes had to do justice, so that I never knew you guilty of one unjust action. But considering you, by I know not what extraordinary disaster, to be about to ex∣ceed the bounds of reason, and to be diverted from your good and antient custom; I therefore made bold (not out of hopes of reward or praise) to come before you, not to counsel you, but to advertise your Majesty of a certain error, into which (as a man, and not as so great an Emperour as you have alwayes been) are now fallen; you know Sir, what you have purposed to do with my Lord the Prince your Son, by reason of a wicked perswati∣tion, which has been imprinted in your mind. But I humbly pray you, and that for the reputation of your honour, to suspend a while this your purpose, and to take my counsel, which being good (as in
<PB N="51" REF="36"/> truth you will know it) you will prefer it before all that hath been said to the contrary; and be not angry Sir at my advice, for as the Proverb sayes, and you very well know it: <HI>He does deserve to be ruined that will not take advice.</HI> The Emperour having heard this preamble, and considered of what had been spoken by the Philosopher, was contented to stay the execution of his Son; however, intimateing to him, that if by good reason, he did not make ap∣pear that he was in an error, and that his defence of the Prince <HI>Erastus</HI> was just, that both the Advocate and Criminal should be hang'd one after another, to which the Philosopher consenting: he began to say,</P>

<P>Then the Physitian said, I d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sire only to know if the Father of the sick Child be here: to this the Queen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nswered, do you think that any but the King is his Father; to this the Physitian replyed, since you are not pleased to tell me the tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will be gon and your Son will dye.</P>
<P>The Queen hearing this resolved (so as she might save her Sons life) to tell t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Physiti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n that which she could not up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n any account l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t any Person in the world know, and having taken on Oath of the Physitian to be secret in what she should tell h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, she blushing for shame thus began.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> would excuse my self but you are not ignorant of the sad condition that married Women are in who are Childless: for in truth that is their only riches and content: for the Husbands who can h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve no Children of their Wives do hate them a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it were her fault, and for this cause the poor Women are disdained, slighted, and ill used, and their Hus∣bands seek out other Women that they may have a Bastard to succeed them after their death.</P>
<P>This being my case having lived long with the King without any Child, and being therefore ac∣counted barren, and slighted by every one, I pur∣posed to know whether the defect was in me or my Husband; whereupon I having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Miller come into the Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to bring in C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rn to the Gra∣nery, and believing that to be a good oppertunity
<PB N="54" REF="38"/> to execute my design, because the King was gone a hunting, and all my Women dispersed, some in one place, and some in an other. I caussed him to enter into my Cabinet, pretending to speak with him a∣lone, where he had to do with me, and that several times after, so that I perceived my self to be with Child, and that I might the better wier the matter, <HI>I</HI> caused the King to lye frequently with me, so that at the time o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my Child-birth it was supposed to be the Kings Child, and so it is still, and after this I was better resp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted of the King, and honoured by all: wherefore I pray you to save him which I got by such art to my great peril. The Physitian smile∣ing to himself answered, Madam, take no further care, <HI>I</HI> will restore your Son safe and sound: and thereupon after many remedies which he gave to the sick person, causing him to be nourished with gross meats, according to his natural constitution he be∣came well. The Physitian then seeing his Patient in good case, and out of danger, and that it was time to return, he took leave of the King and Queen who presented him with Gold and Silver, and gave him good and honourable Company to attend him to his Uncle; to whom he rel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted every part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cular that had hapned, by which relation <HI>Hipocrates</HI> knew the great profit which his Nephew had made in so little time, for which cause, instead of takeing plea∣sure in regard he had so taught him, he conceived a mortal hatred against him, and doubting that the skil of his Nephew would deminish his renown, in regard he was to succeed him, and to possess a great many books, which <HI>Hipocrates</HI> had composed according to the great experience of his time which would en∣crease
<PB N="55" REF="38"/> the fame of his Nephew, and diminish his own if his receits should come into his possession: he there∣fore purposed privately to kill him, and thereupon having caused him to come into his garden where he had all sorts of herbs, he demanded if he knew their several vertues, to which his Nephew answered, yes, he desired him to pluck up one of them which he named, and as the young man stooped to the ground not doubting any thing, the envious old man struck him between the head and shoulders with a hatchet, which he had hidden under his gown, and slew him at the first blow, and to conceale his cruelty, he buried him in the same place; where he had killed him. It hapned (as God is just and leaves nothing unpunish∣ed) that soon after <HI>Hipocrates</HI> fell sick of the bloody flux, so violent that no medicine could stop it. But <HI>Hipocrates</HI> to make tryal of his skil, caused a great, Vessel to be filled with water, whereinto he having cast a certain powder, he drew out several faucets wherewith the vessel was stoped in several places, to see if the water would come out, but the vertue of the powder had so restrained the fludity of the water, that it continued in the vessel, without one drop com∣ing out, as if it had been frozen, at which all the company were astonished, yet nevertheless <HI>Hipocra∣tes</HI> found no good in the flux of his belly, very well knowing that to stop it at once on a suddain, he should put his life in great danger, and therefore let∣ing it take its course, he hoped that nature would be assisting, yet he had great sorrow for the loss of his Nephew, very well knowing that if he had been with him he needed not fear any thing and then he repent∣ed of hi fault (but to late) he sighed and groaned
<PB N="56" REF="39"/> alwayes calling out upon his Nephew, but seeing that all was in vain, he took it so to heart, that he ended his miserable life.</P>
<P>By this Sir you may judge of the rest of my dis∣course, which is this, that none o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght hastily to doe any thing in anger, of which they should afterwards make it irrepai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able, with vain repentance, you have purposed to put the Prince your Son to death, not for any crime that he hath committed: (of which you can be ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red) but at the report of another, but I say once agen to you: that you ought to think once and twice what you do, and against whom; be∣ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red that if you do not suffer your self to be transported with anger; y u will in conclusi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n find your Son the Prince in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ocent of the fact, for which he hath been accused, and of which you at present think him culpable.

<P>THE Empress <HI>Aphrodicia</HI> certainly believing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the next morning her Son in law would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> executed according to the Emperours command; and supposing that this loss would be some trouble to her husband, wherefore to take away the displea∣sure he should receive by the death of his Son, if n t wholly, yet in some Part she provided a magnif∣cent Feast to entertain the Emperour, and to po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s away his melancholly: for it was usual for the Em∣perour and Empress to feast one another, when they had a mind to pass the time away; so that sometimes the Emperour would feast the Ladies, the Empress at an other time treating the Emperour when she had a mind to pass over s me mel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly; dinner time being c me, the Emperour went into the Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eens hall, where the table was covered, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d being sate down, and the Empress by him, en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring into discourse with her, he told her that f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r the good cause he had been advised to slay the exe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion of <HI>Erastus</HI> for that day, which the Empress
<PB N="58" REF="41"/> understanding all the good cheer was altered, and with her usuall disdain, and angry countenance, she said to the Emperour; I see Sir, you well shew the little esteem which you have for your honour, and if the faith you have promised me, and alwayes broken. But I hope that Judgment, and justice will shew you the great fault you want against them both; and I doubt it will happen to you as it did to a wild Boar, who was destroyed by flattery, which is a very good example and which I would relate to you, if I did not think it loss of time, whereupon the Emperour said; my dear, I have directly promised, and sworn to stop for this day, the execution of <HI>Erastus,</HI> and I may not in point of honour break my word and Oath: But I assure you that if some more important cause do not happen, I shall to morrow morning let you know that revenge which <HI>I</HI> know to be reasonable, is as pleasing to me as to your self; and therefore I desire you to let me know the story of the wild boar whereof you have spoken; for on one side, you will much please me, and on the other side, you will it may be make me more resolved then I was. Then the Empress began her discourse said.</P>
<P>There was some time since in a great and spacious forrest a large Wild boar who had no other feeding then the wild fruits which grew naturally without the help of mans art and yet however were very good, as well by reason of the fertility of the ground, as for the good temperature of the Climate, where they grew, among other trees there was a great wild pear-tree, whose fruit did very much please this wild boar; and therefore he came ordinarily thither, and shaking the tree with his shoulders, to make the
<PB N="59" REF="41"/> fruit fall; having filled his belly, he would be gone to his Den. It happened that a Herds-man, that kept a herd of cattle at the entrance of the forrest, lost one of the best of them and believing that it was strayed into the forrest, as indeed it was, considering the diffi∣culty in finding it, be was troubled, but hoped to light upon it, he went to search in the forrest, but it was lost labour, &amp; having spent some dayes in the forrest, &amp; seeing that it was to no purpose; he intended to re∣turn, but in his way he came to this great pear-tree which I have spoken of; and seeing very fair peares, and being somewhat an hungry, he began to beat them down with his staff; he had no sooner tasted of them, but finding them better than he expected, he th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ught it would not be a miss, to carry some to his Master; that he might somewhat appease the anger, which he had against him, for the loss of the Bullock, that he might carry them without damage, he thought it best to gather them with his hand, and thereupon he climbed up the pear-tree, but he was no sooner got up; when the great Boar, which I speak of, came to the foot of the pear-tree, and began to shake it as he was used: The poor Herds-man seeing this furious Animall was afraid, and that he might be rid of him, he threw many pears to him; hoping that when his belly was full, he would be gone again as he was used to do, but it fell out otherwise, for the wild-boar seeing more victuals, than he was used to have; and that with less paines, he eat so many pears that he was ready to burst, and not being able to go back, he lay down under the tree: The poor Herds-man seeing this, was more fearful then before, for on one side, he was in great fear of the wild-boar, and
<PB N="60" REF="42"/> on the other side, he fore-saw the danger, he should be in, of other wild beasts if he should stay all night in the forrest being thus reduced between these two in evitable extremities, he thought it was best to ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose the least; whereupon thinking of the nature of Swine, he began to come down from the tree, as softly as he could, and being so neer the wild Boar that he cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d touch him with his fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, he clawed his back with the nailes of his foot, the wild Boar being p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eased with it, turned his belly upwards; and the Herds-man continuing to claw and scratch him, he fell aslee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: The Herds-man perceiving that, came down to the ground, and seeing this great Animal was safe, he resolved to make him more s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cure, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n drawing out his knife, stuck it into his heart, thus killing h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m as he slept, by this means freeing him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lf from the fear of the wild Boar, and the other wild beasts.</P>

<PB N="66" REF="46"/> she went to her, where being arrived, after many o∣ther discourses; she fell to the matter in hand, that which most a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gred her; letting her know, as well as she could; the necessity wherein she was, and the pur∣pose she had taken to provide otherwise for her self, that she might not dye, in that necessity, praying and conjuring her, for the natural love, which she had al∣ways born to her; that having pitty, and compassion on her, she would make provision against that evil, which would be her death if she had no remedy, and also to her honour; governing her self, after such manner in this aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir that she might find her self re-restored, and so as no person should know any thing. The Poor mother thinking of what her daughter had said to her, for a long time was amazed, not bring able to beli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve her own ears; much less, to believe what she had heard; but in conclusion seeing by her daughters obstinacy, how the matter was; and that what she had said was true; she first of all tried, to direct her, from her wicked purpose, shewing her what offence she would commit puting her honor be∣fore her eyes; alledging to her, many other examples to this purpose, but all was to no purpose; for as to the offence, the young woman answered that the Law could not give her a greater punishment then death, and that continuing in the condition she was then in; she knew her death was sudden: As for the shame and infamy of the world said she, I come to take your advice in that particular; that my honour being sa∣ved, you may provide me with what you know may be necessary, upon this account, and for examples she had enough that served for her purpose, so that all that her mother cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> say, to change her mind
<PB N="67" REF="46"/> from this wicked purpose, was but to beat the aire; whereupon the mother was so troubled, that she thought she should be distracted. The young woman seeing this, began to colt's and flatter her, saying, Dear Mother, have compassion of my youth: You have been young, and therefore know well enough what are the desires of the flesh, which as I have al∣ways heard say, and now I know by experience, are greater, and more vehement in women, than in men; and although the fire is not so great in men, as in women; yet however, as often as they have a mind, and they know where; they give themselves the sa∣tisfaction they desire: But if we miserable women are sruprized but once, besides the shame we indure, they make no matter of killing us: So that for this cause, we other women, ought to put the change up∣on them, to revenge our selves of the shame, that men upon this account do to us. To this the Mother made several replyes, but all was in vain; for so much the more that the Mother endeavoured to turn her from her purpose; so much the more ardent, and passionate she appeared to be: Let what would happen to ex∣tingu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh the fire which consumed her; she did cleer∣ly con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that it would be more for her honour, to contain, than to abandon her self, but she could not imagin how she could live long so, and that therefore the fault should not be imputed to her, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o nature who did so constrain her; further entreating her Mo∣ther to consider of some way to give her content, and to save her honour, protesting unto her, that if she did refuse to assist her; she would hazard her life and honour, praying her once for all, to put all other oppinions out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mind. The poor Mother
<PB N="68" REF="47"/> seeing her daughters obstinacy, knew not what to say further; seeing on the one side, her daughter blinded with love, and so resolved in her purpose that it was not p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssible to alter her mind, and on the other side, she well knew the great wrong, she should doe to her honour, in satisfying the appetite of her daughter: And although she well knew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat she lost time; however she thus made further trial of her daughter, saying, Ah! how stronge a thing is it that <HI>I</HI> see you purpose to violate the bounds of marriage; and count so great ill to your husband, who as you know, loves you as well: or better then any man can love a woman; and therefore I would not have you give such way to your appetite which I confess is great, but not so, but that you may over∣come it if you will, I have been young and as fair as you: and have experienced love affairs, and his fires; but however, I have resisted all with a constan∣cy, and firm res<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ution to love like a woman of honour, so that I never wronged your father; and n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver had tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or any other besides him, much less abandoned my le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f to any other; wherefore then do n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t you do the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me And Mother reply∣ed the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ughter, your consequence is nothing to the purpose, for when my father married you, he was a young gentleman, and as handsome as you, so that he m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght well enough furnish you, with that which women desire above all things; and that you had no occasion to look further, and you had not done well, if you had done him that wrong.

The poor Mother seeing the ob∣stinatness of her daughter, for some time was silent, and then she said; Seeing you in this wicked purpose to abandon your honour to satisfie a base and dis∣ordinate appetite, rather then to see you fall into in∣famy which may happen; matters being not wisely ordered I am content to assist you, in what I may: Yet however, you ought well to consider one point, for although men keep but little loyalty for their wives, as you have said already; yet however they will not suffer them to take the same liberty; but the most part of men, doubting that they wear the hornes, they cut them off; sometimes by poison, sometimes with a Dagger, and sometimes with a sword: True it is that there are agen, some good men, who have a good stomoch to digest all; and all goes down as sweet as milk to them, though they find their wives in the very fact; Now <HI>I</HI> cannot Judge of what Complexion your hus∣band will be upon this occasion; therefore I think it absolutly conversant, to try his patience before y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u proceed further doing him some displeasure of little importance, which will be a tryal of him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

This Gentleman, had in his Garden a Lawrell, which he himself had planted &amp; cultivated, and it was become a great tree, it had a very pleasant shadow under which, the gentleman did often refresh himself with his friends, &amp; pass the time away in dis∣course in the hotest time of the day.

The poor country-man, well enough knowing the pleasure, which his Master took in this tree; would not strick a stroak at it, whereupon his Mistress being angry, gave him many hard speeches threatning him with severe chastisment; for the little respect, &amp; obedience he gave to her comands: And taking the hatchet out of his hand, she her self fell to
<PB N="72" REF="49"/> cutting the fair Lawrel, to which she gave so many stroaks on every side, that she put the poor Lawrel cut of possibility of growing, and although it were then let alone, the servant then seeing that, took his hatchet and finished what she had begun: whose branches by his Mistresses command, being made in∣to faggots, and the body cleft in peices, he put it in∣to a Cart, and carried them to his Masters house, the Cart was hardly unloaden when the Gentle-man re∣turned from hunting; who went presently into his Chamber to refresh and shift himself, when his wife counterfeiting the good huswife, was not long ere she came with a faggot of the fair Lawrel under her arm, which she put upon the fire, aireing her Hus∣bands linnen at it, that she might the better play her project. The Gentleman being astonished to see a fire made of Lawrel, did suspect that some mischeif had bin done to his beloved tree, but he could not imagine that it was cut down, and theref<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re so soon as he had shifted and refreshed himself, he went into the Garden direct y, to the place where his Lawrel had grown, where he saw that he wch had no mind to see; whereupon he began to cry out &amp; curse, swear∣ing by all his Gods, that he would so sharply chastise those who had cut down his Lawrel, that they sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld never forget it: his wife hearing these threatnings, ran into the Garden, and with a smileing c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unte∣nance said to her Husband; that if you will be revenged for that fact, that your vengeance must fall on me, for none but I have cut up your Tree, wherefore did you do it said the Gentle-man, I w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll tell you said she, bring returned from my Mother, where <HI>I</HI> had stayed almost all day,
<PB N="73" REF="49"/> knowing that you were hunting and considering that in regard of your age, and the coldness of the present season, it was impossible but you would have a great need of a fire at your return, and not finding any dry wood to make a present fire, I came into this Garden, and very well knowing that the branches of a Lawrel-tree will make a good fire although they be green; <HI>I</HI> caused them to be made into little fag∣gots, whereof I made your fire as you have seen, and this is the very truth of the whole matter, which was done for your service, and therefore you ought to take it in good part, and now Sir if your anger will not be appeased, and that you resolve up∣on revenge, you may do what you please with me; for <HI>I</HI> shall suffer all with patience, since what I did was intended to serve you; You have done very ill said the Gentleman, and have a care therefore, that for the future you do not act any thing that shall so displease me, for I promise you by the word of a Gentle-man, that <HI>I</HI> shall take satisfaction for both. If you had not been furnished with dry wood in the house, was there not other trees besides my Lawrel, and assure your self, that if you had cut down all the Trees in the Garden I should not have been so troubled as for this one Lawrel: but since it is done, and cannot be helped, we will say no more of it, but for the future you take more care not to displease me.</P>

But since it is done, he ought to appease his anger, the Gentleman seeing that all the sorrow in the world would not restore his bitch a∣gen, was somewhat pecifyed, only saying to his Wife, that she had done very ill in that manner to kill his bitch for so small a fault; this being over the Gentle-man and his Friends, spent their time in their ordinary divertisements, and the young Wo∣man was pleased at her heart, finding that she had so bravely come off from her undertaking, without any difficulty: and therefore the next morning early she went in all haste to her mother, to let her know of this last passage, pressing her to put in ex∣ecution that which she had promised, seeing she had such certain proof of her Husbands patience: the Mother understanding how matters went, made as if she were very glad, and told her Daughter that truly she had reason to keep her word with her, but that she might have greater assurance, and some cle∣rer proof of his heart, she desired one tryal more of his patience, promising and swearing to her daughter, that if her Husband then continued in that temper, she would immediately, and without any delay, give her the content she desired. And what o∣ther proof would you have said the Daughter, I think what we have already is very sufficient: but for ought I see, all your discourses tend only to pro∣long the content, which you have promised to give
<PB N="77" REF="51"/> me; why did you not at first tell me that you would not meddle in it? and then <HI>I</HI> had took an other course. Daughter said the Mother, do not take it ill, for what I do is not to deny you my assistance, but to accommadate your honour, and my own also; the first tryal that you made was upon a Plant, and therefore you proceeded to a second, upon a beast: now I would have you make a third proof upon men, what is it you mean said the Daughter, that I should kill some body, it is somewhat difficult for a woman to do, but if there be no other way to attain my desires, I shall not question but to perform it; God forbid answered the Mother, for I do not intend any such matter, but this is my meaning, that as you have already offended your Husband, so now in the last tryal; the displeasure you shall do him, shall not only extend to him, but also to the Company; and this must be done in somewhat of as great import∣ance as was that of the Lawrel, or Bitch which you killed; and <HI>I</HI> have thought how, and what it shall be. You know your Husbands birth day is very near, and that he usually makes a great feast on that day for his Friends; <HI>I</HI> would have you then when the Table is covered, and the victuals upon it, and every one is seated, that you arise pretending to look for somewhat, and that by some means or other, you throw down the Table, and all that is upon it: and if your Husband lets this pass without being reveng∣ed on you, I promise you, and swear to you, that the very day you shall do this, <HI>I</HI> will content you in that thing, which above all things in the world you most desire; the young woman thought the time long, al∣though it was but three dayes, but she resolved to
<PB N="78" REF="52"/> wait in the mean time, considering with her self the manner of what she was to do, hoping to have a bet∣ter issue for this third enterprise, than she had for the other tw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; the desired day being come, the Gentle∣man caused great preparations to be made, to enter∣tain those guests he had invited: so that there was very good company, and of the greatest Lords of all the Country, the Tables being spread and cover∣ed in such manner as is usual for Persons of his quality, and the hour being come to sit dow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (which was the desi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed time for this young woman, not for the hunger which she had, but for the great desire which she had to satisfie her self, of somewhat else besides v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctuals:) every one took their places ac∣cording to their degrees, and among others the young woman was seated at the upper end of the Table, as it is usual for Ladies, and as the victuals was a ser∣ving, she fastned her keys to the table-cloath, and having thus done, pretending to be in haste to go look for something, she arose and in her riseing she pull'd down the Table and all that was upon it, whereupon the Gentleman being angry, asked wherefore she had thus thrown down the Table; I did perceive said she, that some body had put a strange knife at your trencher, and I very well know∣ing that you could not endure to use any knife but your own, I therefore arose up to look it, and I know not how the Table caught hold of me so that it was thrown down; all the company endeavoured to laugh away the mischance, and pass it for a jest, and withall every one very much commended the great care the young woman had of her Husband. The Gentleman being very discreet, took no no∣tice
<PB N="79" REF="52"/> of it at present, that he might not disturb the Company, but caused the Table to be taken up, and other service brought, for there was plentiful pro∣vision of all sorts of victuals, and thus was the day passed away without thinking of any thing but pass∣time, wherefore the young woman had a world of joy in her heart, beleiving now that there was no obstacle that could hinder her content, so that she only waited the good hour when every one would be gone, that she might go to her Mother, and give her order for that which she so ardently desired; but the Guests kept company together all the day with the Gentleman, that she being forced to continue with them, by necessity deferr'd going to her Mo∣ther till the next morning, not questioning but then all things would fall out to her expectation. But she sound it otherwise, for although the Gentleman had passed away all his birth day, that he might not trouble his guests, without takeing notice of the shame which his wife had caused him: yet however he had not forgotten it, nor the other two outrages which she had done formerly; and therefore being a wise man, he purposed to chastise his wife, without making any noise, and therefore the next morning finding her awake, and that she went to dress her self, to go to her Mother, he commanded that she should not rise, whereupon the good wife being asto∣nished, replyed, that she had a minde to rise, having slept enough already; but the Gentleman answered her, that the reason why he would have her lye in bed, was for her good, and that it was convenient for her to do so: that she might take a medicine that he would give her, for what cause said she, for I
<PB N="80" REF="53"/> need no medicines, for God be thanked I am well and lusty, you are to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lusty said he, and the cause of it is a certain superfluous blood that boyles in your body, which at every turn causes you to play the fool, which is to my displeasure, and a shame to you: do you remember the fair Lawrel which you did cut up the other day, which I loved above all the trees of my Garden: a little while after you killed my B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tch, which was the pleasantest beast I ever had in my house: yesterday you threw down the Table, where there was so good company without consider∣ing the trouble you put them all too, to my great shame on my birth day. Now if I should let all this pass, I know the fourth offence would exceed all the rest, but I have a purpose to cure you, and thereupon causing a good fire to be made in the Chamber, he sent for a Barber, who he had provi∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d ready for the purpose: He being entred the Chamber, he caused his wife to rise, and come to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire, and giving him her right arme he caused him to rub it and chafe it, to fill the veins the better, and then commanded he B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ber to perform his Office; he did as he was commanded, and opened one of the young womans veins, who could not guess what would be the end of this adventure. But see∣ing her blood she began to be afraid, but she could not help her self, for the Gentleman caused her to be held so fast that she could not stir: and he let her continue bleeding thus, till such time as she could bleed no more, without endangering her life, and then he caused the vein of her right arme to be clo∣sed and bound up, but he did the same to her left arme, in such manner that the poor young woman
<PB N="81" REF="53"/> was half dead, and having left all sense was car∣ryed to her bed, where having been some time, as in a sound, and being somewhat come to her self, she sent one of her servants to her Mo∣ther, earnestly praying her to come to her present∣ly, the servant having delivered the message, the Mother made all possible haste to come to her; but she understood of the Messenger by the way how all things had passed, how her Daugher had thrown down the Table, and all the victuals that was upon it; but she who very well knew all the Mistery presently guessed how every thing had hapned, and for what cause: being arrived at her Son in laws Castle, she went directly to her Daughters Chamber, saying to her with a plea∣sant and merry countenance, look you Daughter I am ready to accomplish all that I have promi∣sed you, would you have me bring your Friend hither to day; to this the Daughter replyed with a feeble voice, and so low, that she could hard∣ly be heard: Ah Mother I am dead, all my fire is extinguished, it is no time now to speak of love, but only to think of giving me some Cordial re∣storative.</P>
<P>From this Sir you may comprehend what <HI>I</HI> will in∣ferre, and conclude by this example, you are now old and full of years, and yet have taken a young wife and alth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ugh she wants for nothing, but in that point that young Ladies most desire, wherein I sup∣pose you can do but little to her satisfaction and con∣tent, and for the cause it is that the Empress your wife is troubled with conceits &amp; fancyes in her head, so that whether it be for revenge, or any other end she

The Emperour continued some time in silent meditation, hearing the discourse of the Philosopher <HI>Thernus,</HI> bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he resolved that the execution of the sentence of <HI>Erastus</HI> should be stop∣ed for that day, and withal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sly declared that he would gravely and deliberately examine the fact of his Son.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIII.</HI> The Empress <HI>Aphrodicia</HI> perswades the Emperour to cause Prince <HI>Erastus</HI> to be executed by a discourse which she made to him, of a King of <HI>England;</HI> who having by the Councel of <HI>Merlin,</HI> caused seven of his principal Counsellors heads to be cut off, who under the name and titles of Sages or Doctors, tyrannized over <HI>England,</HI> and by that means the King recovered his sight.</HEAD>
<P>THE Empress had so great an affection to hear the news of the death of her Son in Law, ac∣cording to the promise which the Emperour had made her, that every hour seemed to be a hun∣dred ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r; but she understood the contrary to her expectations, for a Gentleman of her Chamber ac∣quainted her how that the Emperour being induced by the discourse of the Philosopher <HI>Thernus,</HI> had commanded stay of the execution for that day, whereupon she was so enrag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, that she thought she should loose her senses; and retireing into her Chamber, and sighing and crying, she would not see any person all that day, in the evening the Emperour having understood that the Empress was gone to bed, &amp; that she was very ill, he went to see her, endeavour∣ing to comfort her the best he could, knowing that all
<PB N="84" REF="56"/> her ilness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roceeded from melancholly, particular∣ly praying her to be of good chear, alledging se∣veral reasons to her, why she should not take it ill, that he had stayed the execution of his Son <HI>Erastus,</HI> and that he did not intend to stop the course of justice, but to let all the world know that he had proceeded judiciously in that affair. To this the Empress going to anser, fetched a deep sigh, saying, it is not possible Sir, but these delayes must be to my great prejudice; since my honour is so inter∣ressed, and the little regard you have for it, although you your self are principally concern'd: however God be my witness that the greatest sorrow that I have is for your sake, who now seem to me to be re∣duced to the some condition as a certain King of <HI>England</HI> was, who by the just judgement of God became blind; but I wish that like him you will give ear to the Counsel of the Sage <HI>Merlin,</HI> by which means he n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t only recovered his corporal sight, but also had the eyes of his understanding cleered, what and wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was this King said the Emperour, and how was this matter, I pray be not angry but tell me, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r it may be, I shall thereupon take such advice, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u will be as glad that you have told it me, as I shall be joy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul that I have heard it, God grant it replyed the Empress, so that by this means the eyes of your understanding may be opened, and al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hough I expect no more from this discourse than from your former promises; yet however that nothing may be wanting on my part, I shall not forbear to endeavour to let you understand your duty, and thereupon she thus began her discourse. Sometime since there was
<PB N="8" REF="56"/> a King of <HI>England</HI> who desireing that the affairs of his Kingdom should be well managed, and being unwilling to take pains himself, that he might en∣joy the more pleasure, he therefore committed the management thereof to seven great Personages, who belonged to his Court, and who having the repute of the Sages, pretended to have knowledg in all things; whereupon in short time it was brought to this pass, that the King only minding his pleasure, left all dispatches and affairs to these seven Sages who acted all things as they were minded, and gave the King what account they best thought for their purpose, but above all thing; they took care not to displease him, so that in time they were in such high esteem, and they were taken rather to be Lords of all <HI>England</HI> then Counsel∣lours; true it is, that in the beginning they took so good order in the execution of justice, that all things were done in good order: but afterwards when they had tasted of the great gifts and presents that was usually made them; they then were so de∣sirous to heap up riches, that they minded nothing else, without respecting their honour, or the zeal they should have to justice; and among other in∣ventions to raise mony, they found out one than would raise them a world of riches, at that time it was a custome in <HI>England,</HI> for the Natives to give such credit to dreames, that the believed the greatest part of their affairs and chiefly those of importance were divinely re∣vealed to them in visions and dreams which they little or much understood according to
<PB N="86" REF="57"/> to the goodness and sanctity of the persons, who thus should dream, so that when any one had dreamed of any thing that she could not understand, they had re∣course to the Sages (whereof in <HI>England</HI> there was great plenty) and for their advise carried great pre∣sents, as if Gold and Silver would cause the true in∣terpretation of dreams; these seven Deputies or Governours of the Kingdome, understanding of this that they might shew themselves the more knowing, and more excellent in all things than any body else; and more particularly in the interpretations of dre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms, under pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence of takei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g away the abuse which was done upon that account, and that the people might not be dec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ived in the interpretation of dre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey published an E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ict, by which it was prohibited; all persons to go to any to have inter∣pretation of dreams, but to them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lves. In persu∣ance of which E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ct, a world of people came to them every d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, with great presents: so that in short time these Lords were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in mony then the King himself, who minding nothing but to take his plea¦sure, fell into a v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y strange accident: for having hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts to be pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ched in a very pleasant For∣rest to please the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dies with a co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> at hunt∣ing; he was no sooner gone out of the ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of <HI>London,</HI> to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to this hunting, but that his eye-sight was so troubl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d that he could not see, wherefore taking adv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce of his Physicians; who looking on the K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gs eyes, found they were fair and without blemish; and under∣standing that he had no pain in his head that he was not wounded, that might occasion this blindness,
<PB N="87" REF="57"/> they knew not what to think of it, but only advised the King to return to his Pallace, and go rest himself, and that in the mean time they would consult among themselves of this accident to remedy it as well as possibly they could; according to this advise the King turned his bridle to return back, but he was no sooner entered the City-gate, but he recovered his sign without using any remedy; whereupon being not only joyful, but wondring with a merry heart, he turned his bridle to go follow the company; but he was no sooner out of the City, but he was agen taken with his former blindness, so that he was forced to turn back towards the Court and yet so soon as he was entred within the City-gates, he recovered his for∣mer sight, yet in regard the time was somewhat spent, he put off the hunting untill a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other time▪</P>
<P>The next day going to pass away some time at a garden, that was without the City, he was no sooner passed <HI>London</HI> Gates, but he became blind as he had done the day before, and no soon∣er was he returned in the City, but he saw as cleerly as he had formerly done; upon this account the Physitians were amazed, they had many consultations but without any effect: for in ge∣neral it was thus, the Kings sight was good so long as he was within the Cit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, but so soon as he was out of it he became blind, and al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hough he went out at several Gates, and had tryed them all yet he still continued blind so long as he was out of the Ci∣ty, and when he returned he could see well enough. In this condition this poor Prince remained for sometime, and c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d not finde any remed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="88" REF="58"/> which was a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffliction to him, to see himself confin'd to the City of <HI>London,</HI> whereupon one day he called the seven Counsellors, to whom he had committed the Government of the Kingdome, remembring that they had given out that they could give a reason for all things, and therefore he ex∣presly enjoyned them that they should make known to him the cause of his blindness; that he might finde a remedy without being thus confined within the walls of the City of <HI>London:</HI> but these great Sages who knew as little of the causes as the King, were so amazed that they could not speak, answer a word to purpose, yet however dissembling their ig∣norance, they told the King that the case required to take some time of advice to consult well on the matter, and to studdy on it, that they might give him such an answer as might be to his content; to this the King replyed, I give you all this day to advise upon it, and charge you that tomorrow morning you give me an answer; but the Sages finding this time to be too precise and too short, told him, that the case was of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t importance, that it required a moneth of delay: how a moneth said the King, is this the great readiness which you boast to have by your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kil, presently to resolve all doubts and question<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and consult together, and in fif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een dayes resolve me of what I desire, and finde a remedy, or I promise you, I will make an example of you to all such as for the fu∣ture shall he so bold as to abuse their Princes. These poor unadvised Sages hearing this were much troub∣led, yet since they had a terme of fifteen dayes, they pluckt up their spirits, hoping in that time to supply their ignorance by the knowledg of some o∣ther,
<PB N="89" REF="58"/> so that they assured the King that within the time prefixed they would give him the satisfaction he desired, and having took leave of the King, they each of them sever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly sent away messengers in Post to all parts, to finde out some knowing person, to whom they might apply themselves in this affair, and their Messengers had good success, they hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of the vertue and miraculous spirit of the child <HI>Mer∣lin,</HI> and of the sayings he used, which surpassed all humain understanding. This child was but young, and was born miraculously, so that it was believed that his Mother had conceived being a Virgin, being with child by a Spirit; or a Magician: who it was reported had given her a great belly without touch∣ing her: by means of a familiar Spirit, but let it be so or not, the child was no sooner born, but he be∣gan to let the world know that he had more than hu∣main knowledg, so that in his very Cradle he speak the most admirable things in the world; whether it was in resolving questions, or foretelling thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to come, or describeing things past, as authentically as if he had seen them, and he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pake nothing, but he gave a good reason for it: that it was not p ssible to imagine that any thing could be contradictory to his reasons, these Sages then purposed to go finde the young <HI>Merlin,</HI> to take his advice how they clear themselves from the Labrin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h wherein they were involved, and they travell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d so long that at last they c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me to the place where he re∣sided, who before had fore-told their com∣ing to his Mother, and several others advising

This Gentleman from his infancy having been well educated in learning, and brought up in all vertues, and commendable exercises, suitable to his degree, he became so great a proficient therein, that there was u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other talk in <HI>Padua,</HI> but of the excel∣len<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> education and good nourtriture of the young Gentleman; by which means his father was partaker of no small honour, besides the inward satisfaction which p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssest his heart, it come to pass this young Gentle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ens Father dyed, and having paid the debt

<P>Notwithstanding, without secluding himself from those honest exercises in which he was brought up, he managed so dexterously his affaire, that one might say he was born to rule an govern an Em∣pire: and this rendred him more admirable to e∣very one.</P>
<P>The Relations and Friends of this young Gen∣tleman, seeing how orderly he governed his house, and being the sole male of that family which was left, perswaded him to marry, that so good and antient family might not be lost by his faul∣ty neglect of procreation. To which the Gen∣tleman would not condescend at first, but opposed it with much ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tinacy.

<P>Now this Gentlewoman had a Chamber-maid a∣mong other servants who was an excellent Govern∣ness of a house, to whom her Mistress gave a great deal more l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>berty than to others, for that love and fidelity she experimentally had found in her, not-with-standing this great govern∣ness, doing as many had done before, who finding themselves pamper'd by good dyet and enter∣tainment, never think of their honour, began to cast a lustful eye upon one of the servants of the house, and being over confident of the good opinion her

<P>Without any consideration had to her repu∣tation, and upon these thoughts she ordered the matter, so that she got this servant within her amorous net, or toyl, however the fear and danger counterpoised the pleasure: there two A∣morists had not been long in the Chamber, ere their Mistriss (which was continually busied e∣very where in the affairs of the house,) surpri∣zed them as they lay on the bed in the very act; at which being much enraged, seeing the hainous∣ness of the fact which they committed, was a∣bout to have delivered them both into the hands of her Husband, for him to inflict a punishment agreable as the crime required.</P>
<P>But then thinking with her self (being pru∣dent and discreet) that should she advertise her Hus∣band hereof, there might be great danger, that the zeal which he had for the honour of his house, might so transport him, that he might kill them both, and so justice be offended with him; where∣fore she was resolved not to speak a word, and on∣ly with the severity of rebuke turned the man ser∣vant out of doors, and taking her Chamber-maid by the arm, lead her into an obscure place, where any noise could not be heard, and there did beat her beyond sufferance; thus bruised and beaten she was forced to keep her bed, under the pretence of being very sick and thus

<P>Having discourst her self throughly on this point, and concluded how she should work he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> design, she immagined it would never come to perfection, as long as her Mistress should be so watchful over her, and therefore seeming to take all in g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t which her Mistress had done to her, became very plyable and pleasant, although within she carried nothing but poy∣son.</P>

<P>Now among others, this Gentleman had a young servant, whom from his infancy he brought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in his own family; who was handsome, bold and of a gracefull d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>portment; also his Mist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess l v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him well, not for lust, but for the goodness she saw him and his readiness to serve his,
<PB N="120" REF="75"/> now this Gentleman thought within himself, that if any servant belonging to him, had done him this wrong it must be him, but the great loyalty and fidelity which he had always known in his wife, and this servant made; the case seem very strange and intricate, how ever he resolved to be very vigilent to see whither by himself or other means, he could come to understand the truth, and in short looking narrowly into the deportment of this his ser∣vant, he Judged him the likliest of all his ser∣vants.</P>
<P>He saw otherwise his servant had no other propensity, then to serve his Master; waiting at table, and consequently on his Mistress, in such manner that upon the least signall gi∣ven he flew to execute what was commanded him: Also he began to suspect seeing his wife was more desirous to be serv'd by him, then the rest and fancied (as commonly it happens to such as are tainted with jealousie) that all that his wife did she was accustomed to do, and that the forward, and ready service of <HI>Henry</HI> (for so this servant was called) at was an unde∣niable argument, proving what the Chamber-ma d had related; and as his jealousie began to en∣crease, he frequently resolved to kill, both w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe and servant, and thought he had proof sufficient to confirm him in the fact, but remembring that the Chamber-maid had told him, that at any time and as often as he would<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; she would lead, him by the hand where he might satisfie himself; he altered his purpose, concluding to see if it
<PB N="105" REF="76"/> were possible, if he could surprize them in the very fact, to show that with good and just reason, he had done that which he had before determined; for which purpose, having secretly got the Chamber∣maid to come to him in his closet, he asked her whe∣ther she was willing to shew him that which she had told him concerning his wife; to which this wicked Chamber-maid answered; is there any thing more easy then this? Do only this which <HI>I</HI> shall tell you, and you shall see with both your eyes, that which shall make you mad to see. This very day if you please; seem to go out of Town for some few days, and a little while after return that night, and I gi∣ving you the signe, to which come without knocking at the door, and I will let you in; and then you may go briskly into the Chamber of your wife, for there you shall find the Cuckow brooding in a Nest that's none of his own.</P>
<P>This over credulous Gentleman finding the coun∣sell good of this wicked Chamber-maid, presently called for his Boots, and having his horse got ready said to his wise, I must go out of Town for some days, I recommend to you the care and mannagment of all; and taking his leave of her, as it was usual for him to do when he had travailed abroad, but he rode no further than the extream parts of the Suburbs; where in a secret place he lay occult, till about mid∣night and then perceiving the hour proper, for what he had resolv'd upon; he took a poysoned Dagger which he stuck by his side, and in this equipage he directed himself toward his Pallace; where arriving, he made the signall, which he had told the Chamber-maid, who being very watchfull as she was, ran
<PB N="106" REF="76"/> instantly like a fury, to <HI>Henry's</HI> Chamber door at which she knockt very loudly crying out to him, <HI>Henry</HI> d'ye hear make hast, run quickly to your Mistresses Chamber, who is taken sud∣denly ill, and commands you in all hast to come and speak with her; that she may send you to a Physitian.

The poor Gentlewomen who had yet some little strength remaining (for the poison had not yet seiz∣ed her heart) raising her self as well as she could, cry out saying. Oh God! the sin of my husband is greater and more enormous than I thought it was; for I thought he aimed at my life alone, but I see we are both Murtherers; and have slain wrongfully the Innocent, I pray thee O God be pleased to enlghten him, and let him know our fidelity; to the end our honour may endure unwrong'd blamless and immaculate, turning thy eyes with justice, on that wicked Chamber-maid, making appear the trea∣chery she hath here committed; and hereupon she fell dead; being unable to pronounce her last words: for had she had more strength she had dis∣covered all, remembring her self what <HI>Henry</HI> said at the Chamber door, whom the Chamber-maid had sent thither, under the pretence of her Mistress calling for him, and now she seeing them dead; con∣cluded th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the danger of the treachery, was blown over but death stopt her in her full career. The Gen∣tleman seeing the great resolution, and constancy in which his wife departed this life, was in a miserable taking; although he had too confidently believed his eyes, by whom he thought to have found his wife faulty; yet notwithstanding by the last words pro∣ceeding from his wifes mouth, falling dead, he began to suspect some treachery in this act on the Chamber-maids

Having then call'd the Cham∣ber-maid, who mistrusting some danger for the evil she had done, came trembling; but he began to ask her with a smileing countenance (but within most desp∣erately heavy) by what means and in what manner she to finde out the loves of <HI>Henry</HI> and his wife, came or whether it was long since that she discovered this amorous intreague; and where was it that she first surpriz'd them in the fact, asking many such like questions: to which the Chamber-maid answered in tearms so intricate and contrary, speaking some∣times things the Gentleman knew were impossible that he concluded to take this following course with her looking very pleasantly on the Chamber-maid, he said to her: thou now hast of thy Mistris that which thou desired'st for she evil treated thee, but she will now be never more offensive to thy eyes, for which cause <HI>I</HI> am now obliged to thee that thou hast given me the means to be rid of that offensive thing which enraged me so often under pretence of zeal to my honour, for which I will assure thee, <HI>I</HI> shall not dye in thy debt: but since you have done me one kindness, pray do me another, and that is to tell me freely the truth of this business, and how it stands in every particular, for I know very well it is otherwise than I was made to beleive, to have the colour and occasion to do what I have already done.

<P>THere dwelt in a certain City, a Kingh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> well stri∣ken in years, who notwithstanding married a wife; whose youth and beauty bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h conjoyned to make her the subject of every mans admiration, these two things, so endeared his affections towards her, that their was no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing to her, by him more p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>izable in the whole universe; now least at any time he might be robb'd, of this inesteemable Jewell, after with his own hands he had lockt hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> doors, he secured the keys under his beds-head. By the way you are to under∣stand that by the Low<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the City, at a certain hour of the night a Bell was usually rung; after the sound of which, if either man or woman was found gadding in the streets, they were instantly seiz'd and having been detain'd in prison <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> might, the next morning they stood in the Pillory, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an object of shame and laughter to all the beholders.</P>
<P>This antient Knight, by reason of his age, was im∣potent, feeble; and altogether unable, to give that satisfaction as youth required; as well for procreati∣on as delight, and therefore his young wife, found out away to supply his defects, by taking the keys every night from under his head, when fast asleep &amp; opening the doors went to her paramour, who having lustfully enjoyed her sill, returned and lay'd the keys in the same place, from whence she took then.</P>
<P>It so happened (but not expected) that one night
<PB N="131" REF="82"/> fafter she was gone, to prosecute her accustomed de∣lights, that her husband awaked, and m ssing his wife felt for the keys, but finding them not, he went down to the door, which he found open; therefore he bolt∣ed it, and returned to his Chamber, and suspecting his wifes levity, he lookt out of the window to ob∣serve the passages, which might happen in the street: When it was very late, or rather early his wife came from her lustfull <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>allion, but found the door bolted a∣gainst her; however she took the boldness to knock. Hereupon the good old Knight looking out of the window, and seeing it was his disloyal wife, spake to her in this manner; O thou wicked &amp; unchast woman, have I now found you out; how often may <HI>I</HI> not from hence conclude thou hast committed adultry, &amp; defiled thy marriage bed; for which cause stand there till the ringing of the Bell, that the Watch may take thee, &amp; that punishment may ensue, according to thy demerit. To which she cunningly &amp; cogingly replied; my Lord, why do you thus unjustly charge me; I am no ways guilty of your accusation, for if you will know the truth, <HI>I</HI> was sent for by my Mother, being taken dangerously ill; now finding you in so sweet asleep, I was loath to wake you, &amp; therefore without the least noise I rose, &amp; taking the keys I opened the doors &amp; went whether my duty commanded me. I found my Mother sick even to death, &amp; though I believe she cannot live till the morning, yet so great was my af∣fection to you, that I came away &amp; left a dying Mo∣ther to return to a dear and loving husband wherefore <HI>I</HI> beseech you let me in; but the Knight utterly re∣fused it: hereupon she reminded him, what a shame it would be (were she taken) not only to himself, her
<PB N="132" REF="82"/> self, but to all their relations, using besides all the per∣swasions her subtile invention could find out requisit for her purpose, but all prov'd unavailable, when she saw nothing would prevaile, she bethought her self of this stratagem: my Lord (said she) you know by this door there is a well, if you let me not in, I will drown my self therein, to avoid the shame <HI>I</HI> see is coming upon me, and my friends in my behalf. As the old Gentleman was about to reprove her further; the moon went down, &amp; now was the night obscured with a darkness, more then usuall, she being glad of this advantage, she thus spake; that I may dye like a Christian, before I drown my self, I will make my last Will and Testament, and first I bequeath my Soul to Heaven, and my body to the Earth, but all other things what ever, I solely leave to my dear husband, for him to dispose of, as he shall think convenient; having finished her saying she went to the well, and there finding a great stone, she took it up in her arms and lifting it up cryed out, now <HI>I</HI> drown my self, and to threw the stone into the well, having thus done she stept to the side of the door again, and there absconded her self. At the n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the stones fall into the well, the old man verily bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d that his wife had been as good as her word, in drowning her self, and having made a miserable out cry ran hastily down to the Well, to prevent what not∣withstanding he thought irrecoverable he was no sooner out but she got in a do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs, and having lockt them, went up into her Chamber, and lookt out of the window as he had done before, and having heard along while the sad complaints, the poor old man made for

<P>Now said the Philosopher to the Emperour have you minded well this story, and he said right well: then said the Philosopher if you execute your Son, being thereunto instigated by your wife your con∣dition may prove more unfortunate than the antient Knights. Hereupon the Emperour con∣demned very much the lew'dness and unworthiness of the woman, and said moreover that for that very cause <HI>Erastus</HI> should not dye that day, the Philoso∣pher having applauded his resolution, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>bly thankt him for it, he departed.</P>

Some little time after the poor Mother, who was thus wounded in the leg fell into a feaver which depriv'd her of life, leaving her Son richer in villany then he was before, having with his own hand, kill'd both Father and Mother. God grant Sir, the like befall you not, for certainly I am much afraid hereof, and that you will be redu∣ced to the same danger, that this Treasurer fell into, and as it is an honest woman that gives you this ad∣vice for your benefit, so I shall never desist to tell you sincerly, and in pure verity whatsoever I shall understand; and be not angry, that I put you in mind of your duty. The Treasurer followed the evill counsell of his Son, and so lost his honour, and his life by the hand of him, who should have given him his best assistance; do you also follow the counsell of your fine Philosophers, who to have the mannagment of affairs, to rule and govern the world at their pleasure, thinking of nothing but the installing of their Disciple in your Imperiall seat, to the hazard of your life, and loss of honour.

Now as we said be∣fore, this Damsel was a very great beauty, and the same thereof, which spread it self all there about was much greater: For which cause a young Gentleman (of whom <HI>I</HI> shall speak more at large anon) forsook his own house, to put something on fact, he should think most requisit. In process of time fortune or love brought it to pass, that it happened that a strange Gentleman who had a Father very rich arrived at the Matropolis of <HI>Morocco</HI> where having lived a while, there happened one of these solemn annuall Feastivals which invited him to go and see their publick sports, which were usually performed on those days, to de∣light the people, where being come, &amp; and consider∣ing every thing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t leng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h he saw the arrivall of the Governers wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, to whom every one gave place, and shew'd their reverance, as well for that rank sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> held in Magistracy, as for her excellent deportment, &amp; in∣comparable beauty, which was then accompanied with rich accoutrem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and so many gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ces, wh ch d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zled the eyes of the spectators.

In fine, having his eyes con∣tinually fixt on the Governe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s &amp; considering her brave behaviour with gestures all divine was presently cap∣tivated by love, so that his internall passions (wh ch afflicted his mind) constrain'd him to manifest by out∣ward signs, that which was contain'd within his breast if any there had taken notice; but every one had his eyes so busied, that his passion wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not discovered, fortune being than very favourable, especially in this the that damsel looking now here, now there, at last cast her eyes upon the young Gent. whom finding in a good ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b &amp; gesture, she amorously glanced her eyes upon him, &amp; he on her, so that the glances which past between these lovers, had in a little time so absolutly disposed of the heart of this Gentlewoman, that she shew'd as much satisfaction in the friend-ship of this Gent. as he shewed affection for her service. Now that which incited her to consent easily, to the friend∣ship of this Gent. was her hopes by his means, to be freed out of Prison; forgeting all the difficulties she formerly found for her deliverance. The sports being finisht, the people began to with-draw, so did these new two lovers, fixing their eyes on each other, as f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r

In short, having eyed her all the way he went to his place of standing, and thinking she would excuse him, if he was less lavish of h s amorous glances, since there was so ma∣ny eyes upon them, he hasted to his post or place ap∣pointed, to be armed, and being arm'd from head to foot in white armour, he came to the course with a Lance all silver'd over, both thicker and larger than customary, having his head-price crested with a black and white Plume of Feathers, answering the the colours of his Horses caparison; under the Helmet there was a Corsset of Beass, out of which issued a little smoak, denoting the fire that was hid∣den within, with a scrole whereon was written in Letters of Gold these words, <HI>'Tis hard to hide a flame.</HI> This devise was thus invented by him, to ma∣ny rest that aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on which was known to very few: every one began to reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd from head to foot this br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght Cavaleer, one saying this, another that, yet every one mistaken, for this Gentleman had his Vi∣z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r down to able <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd himself from knowledg, but e∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry one might kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w his horse by reason of his great Caparison.

On a sudden the white Cavalleer elevated his Gantlet, in token he accepted the chall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nge with its conditions wherein (to be short) he behaved himself so well that he won the Chain, having past his Lance against the head of his antagonist. The second defendant, he so briskly charg'd, that he made his head kiss the Pommel of his Saddle. This made every one amazed, for every one held these two defendants the most valliant and couragious Cavalleers in all <HI>Morocco,</HI> as indeed they were and having besides conquered many other Gent∣leman and carried off in token of victory many small Chains and perfumed Gloves, and having sustained many a shock with Gallantry of Spirit, all the whole assembly remained astonisht. Yet every one eager∣ly desired to know who was this Cavalleer who had so admirabley behav'd himself in the Turnaments: but above all the Governour had a Great affection who earnestly besought him to make himself known for the honour of nobility, to the end that the accu∣mulation of praises which he had merited, might not vanish in the aire. Whereupon the Gentleman turn∣ing his face to the Governess, who without saying any thing shew'd by a sign that she was desirous to know this Cavalleer (for women are more affected with curosity than men) hereupon the Cavalleer put∣ting up his vizier? see here 'tis <HI>Fabio</HI> (for so he was called) your friend and servant.</P>
<P>This being observ'd by all, there was a general
<PB N="158" REF="99"/> amazement seized the whole Company, and chiefly those who before thought him a man more fit for pleasure than for Action, The day being far spent, a retreat was sounded to put an end to the Tourne∣ment, and the white Cavaleer was accompanied with Drums and Trumpets towards his Lodging, still pre∣tending to treat one and another, staying in the street till the Governess should pass that way, who was at∣tended with an honourable retinue; to whom he made a profound reverance without as to the wife of the Governour, but within, as to his dearest friend, and having received the like from her, with a joyfull countenance he reteuned to his own habitation, where after he had paid those respects due to the honour was done him, he then began to ruminate on his love concerns, and how he should accomplsh them, in which considerations he found many and great diffi∣culties: how ever like a true Lover, finding nothing impossible, after a long consultation with himself, he dispatcht his servant whom (he could confidently trust) to fetch him a Master Mason, which was a stranger, and very skilful in his Art, such a one was brought him in a short time, whom this Gentleman treated so generously well, that he became absolutely his creature, sealing up his mouth with a world of presents he gave him, adding with all threats if he discovered the design, so that it was buried between them three, the Master, Servant, and Mason; the latter of whom began to set his hands to work to e∣very thing he was commanded, and that was to spring a Mine under the foundations of the Tower where the Damsel was, with as little noise as might be, to which the Gentleman lent his assistance very fre∣quently in digging and carrying out the earth,
<PB N="159" REF="99"/> continuing their labour, in a little time they under∣mined the Tower without the least discovery. Here∣upon the Gentleman discovered to the Mason his re∣solution of mounting into the Chamber of the Dam∣sel; to which the Mason gave him admission, as well by reason of his long experience in such matters, as by reason of the advantage of the Winding stairs, which were in the said Tower; by which means it was very easie to ascend into the Chamber of the Damsel; yet there were several impediments in the way, however the Mason found out other ways to ascend, listning to the Walls if any one took notice, at length they arriv'd at the floore of the Chamber, or rather prison of the Damsel; not knowing now what to do but to trust in fortune, and leave the issue of all to her guidanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, intending not to pass further as yet for fear of inconveniencie, resting there &amp; hoping in a little time to have some beetter opportunity sub∣miting his passion to reason which ought to govern in all such matters and respects: Upon the approach of a solemn festival, the Gentleman was not unmind∣ful of putting an end to his enterprize, and having gi∣ven out that he was extreem sick and that he could not go to see the publ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck sports, much less take plea∣sure in them, &amp; the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>msel being releast for that day to go and see them; this Gentleman <HI>Fabio</HI> said to the Mason; Master this opportunity will not admit us to loose time, for this is the day whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ein we ought to esteem our selves no less happy (every thing favour∣ing us) then <HI>Deucalion</HI> and <HI>Phyrrha</HI> after the Deluge, so that for any one to loose one single minute of this opportunity were to hate himself, &amp; provoke the Gods. Hereupon the Master and the servant immea∣diately
<PB N="160" REF="100"/> furnisht themselves with instruments, and o∣ther things requisite for their purpose, and having past the Mine they had made, they arriv'd at the place they desired, where being come they searcht round a∣bout and at last found out in a little time a hole big enough for a man to enter, at that very corner where stood the bed of the Damsel, according as the Master Mason had contriv'd with the assistance of the God of love. The Gentleman being entred the Chamber (whilst the Mason and servant were regar∣ding the hole, how to return again another time with out discovery) he regardful lookt about the Cham∣ber, wherein he saw a little box lying open (for it had no key, which which was made in the form of a little Press to contein Clothes, wherein were rich habilliments which he would not disorder, as well by reason he had no leisure, as that he might not be dis∣covered; notwithstanding having found a place (at he thought, were the Damsel was accustomed to lay her hand at her return he resolved there to leave some signal of his entrance, which however was so obscure, that though any other should see it by chance, he should not gather any thing from it, and so left this following <HI>Madrigall,</HI> which some days before he had composed in manner of a Riddle.</P>

<P>The Gentleman having laid this <HI>Madrigal</HI> where he purposed, returned to the Mason, desiring him to dispatch what he had begun; so that all being descen∣ded, and the Gentleman seeing all things as he would have it, had some thoughts of killing the Mason to assertain the non discovery of his plot, but mov'd with compassion, he changed his intention, and giving him many presents he caus'd him to embark the same day, and leave <HI>Morocco.</HI> In the mean time the Dam∣sel being entred her Hermitage, she tumbled over some things she had, amongst which she sound the <HI>Madrigal,</HI> which she read and read again and again, thinking and rethinking of the interpretation there∣of, how it could be laid there, and what should the issue be thereof, in sine she gathered who it should be that layed it there, but could not collect by what means it could be left; and at last concluded it must be done by Nicromancy; for in those days there were many Witches, and many put confi∣dence in them. Whilst she was in these strange imaginations supper time, and consequently that of bed time drew near, and so she went to bed, not with an intent to sleep but to be vigilant to the intent she might see the issue of this doub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ful
<PB N="162" REF="101"/> matter. At length the night being far Spent, and ha∣ving tyred her self with thinking, she was constrain'd to give repose to her senses, and so fell into a sound sleep. Now according to her thoughts awake she saw in a dream what afterwards hapened; for she thought she saw him who had so much eyed her before &amp; she him, was on the battlements of the Castle bewailing himself by reason of those impediments and obstructi∣ons, which were laid for the hindering one anothers pleasures; and that then the prison miraclously was opened, and as miraclously shut as soon as he was en∣tred; and that both afterwards fell into great anexi∣ty of minde, she fearing that there was no means left for his going out, and he fear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng he was surprised for gathering the fruits which belonged to the Master of the house; but whither a truth or a dream, it was ve∣ry true that during the time of her dreaming, the Gentleman who had tarried some while from coming that he might not affright the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>msel, entred at last softly through the hole into the chamber of the dam∣sel, and coming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r the bed perceiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d that she knew nothing, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d these few words: Mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, <HI>I</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m he that am wholy yours, to whom ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>erday fortune was so favourable as to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve the means to make known to you in wri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng, the main end of all my in∣tentions is onely to love you, as you may well g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r by signs in my way &amp; by my eyes in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> publick pass times; to be brief it is <HI>I</HI> that am l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dg'd so near this Tower, for no other purpose, but to employ my life in your service, if you please to accept of my indea∣vours, and finally to deliver you from this thral dom.

<PB N="163" REF="101"/> for fear as desire she had to understand the sequel of this business, kept her mouth shut, but her ears open to the saying of the Gentlemen; whose request being well understood, &amp; unwilling to shew her self harder than a stone, and being more unwilling to the ruine of the Gentleman, and much more of her self; thinking it withal an Act of Piety to preserve those who love us, became at length inclinable to pitty, and resolved to entertain him, whereupon without further loss of time they both addrest themselves for the gathering of loves fruits; and to make manifest the Riddle, thinking of nothing else but the perpetuity of their pleasure; advising the best way how they should meet often together.</P>
<P>This story here inserted, Sir, it tends much to our purpose, and those also who have endeavoured to know women; but principally those many Hypo∣crites, which makes profession of being half Saints. This Damsel of whom we speak, Sir, not induring to be lock't up under the guard of her Husband, (who we may presume had good reason to be careful of that he valued above every thing;) was resolved for a long time to be revenged of him, and so seeing occasion offer it self, she greedily laid hold thereon; not only to save <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd deliver her self, but also to con∣clude the detriment and confusion of the poor inno∣cent; and so having taken her pleasure many nights with her friend, she resolved to forsake her Husband, and cleave to this young Gentleman, and that with much subtlety, so that she was pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s'd, and her old man blam'd. In the mean time her friend visited he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> often, and she desirous to come to that end the Gen∣tleman propounded, without regarding any thing bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="164" REF="102"/> the present she spake to him in these words; my friend <HI>I</HI> know you are valiant and that you hear me great affection, wherefore it is requisite that you en∣terprize something in which I shall have the greatest charge, to the intent that if any thing happen contra∣ry to our design which <HI>I</HI> hope, the whole may be im∣puted to me, and no other; and that you may not perplex your brain, I will undertake the particular management.</P>
<P>In the first place tomorrow morning going to Court you shall wear on your finger one of the rings of my Musty Husband, which <HI>I</HI> shall give you, and so order the basiness, that he may see it on your fin∣ger, and I doubt not but imm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>diately he will know it to be his own, in such sort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat he will aske you, whence you had it; to which you must answer that you have had it a long time, say no more, but come straight aw y to me, and give me the ring again, after∣wards I shall informe you how things proceed. Day breaking (which constrained the Gentle-man to de∣part) the Damsel gave him the good morrow, putting the ring on his singer wi h which the Gentleman de∣rected his course towards the Governour, and had no soon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> perf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>med hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>beisance towards him, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vern u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> saw that which netled h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m to see, and although he dissembled the knowledg o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what of that which was too true, yet he could not but fix his eyes a long time thereon, and to shew by some strange gestures that he was not well pleased; in such manner that many of the attendants desired to know the reason of this suddain change; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he presently went to the Tower, and was so long in opening the several doors, that the Gentleman who was gone
<PB N="165" REF="102"/> before had the opportunity of delivering the ring to her from whence he had it; now the old Dotard ha∣ving found the said ring in the place he desired, rested himself satisfied, and was resolved to lye with her the following night which was accordingly done; of which her friend was advertised by a certain signal given by her, which he finding returned to his lodg∣ing.</P>
<P>The day following the Gentleman seeing all things safe return'd to his accustomed rest, where he and the Damsel had time enough to laugh at the poor old∣man. In fine the Damsel said to the Gentleman; my friend the God of Love hath given us a good be∣ginning to satisfie our selves, and certainly I hope no less of the middle &amp; conclusion, and so for the second tryal, you shall do what I shall tell you, and do but as you did with the ring in which you behaved your self most gallantly. The Gentleman descended from the Tower (after he had received a little <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g</HI> from her which she kept for her pastime,) and went to the Court, carrying with him the little Dog, the Go∣vernour seeing his little dog, was about to have call'd him by his name, but considering the quality of him who held him, and wondering how it was possible for it to be procured, for he saw by all the marks of the dog, that it must be the same, he said not a word but went straight to the Tower, grinding his teeth, and threatning both his wife and Gentle∣man that he had worse dog for them both then they had of his. The young Gentleman turning his back to the Governour disposed of the Dog with as much celerity as he had done with the ring.</P>
<P>The Governour being entred the Chamber

In the mean time the Gentleman had his full delight with the Damsel; who was desirous to put an end to all; resolving with her Friend about the means they should take to deliver her from this servitude, shewing him the way he should take, and what pretences he must use, and that he must fit a Galley, as swift of sail as he could choose, and that he should place her in some Haven near the City, and pretending that he was in haste to be gone, he should procure some strange H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lliments for her, and ha∣ving taken leave of the old Dota<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, they should get aloft with all speed they could, discovering how he had cheated her Husband as he did. The Gentleman descended the Tower, and went to procure the light∣est Galley in all <HI>Morroco,</HI> and having victual'd and arm'd her he put her off a little to Sea, the better to abscond his design: after this he subtlely contriv'd womans apparel very rich, but made after a strange manner, the which he laid up in his Chamber, the hour for their design being come, the Damsel remov'd from her Prison that night she knew the Dotard would not come to see her, he conducted her to the Galley which was arrived at the Port that very night∣giving out that it was a strange Galley then come in, and having embarked his Lady, he committed her to the care of his trusty servant, and return'd a shore to perfect his design. Now the Govenour was rilen very early to go a hunting, and seeing <HI>Fabio,</HI> desired
<PB N="167" REF="103"/> him to make one of the Party, of which he excuse himself, saying to the Governour that he was con∣strained to lay all business aside to return speedily into his own Country. How said the Governour, shall we be deprived of the company of a man so good and honest as you are: whereupon the Gentle∣man replyed that he could be content to stay and see their pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>times, but that he was constrain'd to depart as suddenly as he could, having received the good ty∣dings of the peace his Parents had concluded with those of the Gentleman he had Du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l'd with for wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch cause his presence was altogether requisite for the ratifying what had past in his absence, and that he fear'd delay in going might endanger him more than any thing else; the Governour having askt who brought him this news, the Gentleman answer'd to tell you the truth it is my dear Female friend who who alwayes hath confer'd on me her friendship, who being much troubled at my absence, is very de∣sirous of my return, being come in all baste for that purpose, in a Pinnace which arriv'd in the Port this mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning at break of day; wherefore I am come ex∣presly to take my leave of you, according to that service and duty <HI>I</HI> ever owed you, and to pray you also that you will drink a glass of wine with me in that Vessel which is come on purpose to carry me off; to the intent with better courage I may set sail. The Governour praising much the Cordiality and Friendship of the Damsel which was come to find our <HI>Fabio,</HI> promised him to go and dine with him in the Galley, and following his hunting, the young Gentleman in the mean time gave order for dinner after the best manner he could: dinner time being
<PB N="168" REF="104"/> come he went before the Governour, with several Gentlemen his friends whom he also c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nducted thither, and being ariv'd near the Port, he began to consider and amongst other things he declared that for the great love he had found in his friend in times past which she had sufficiently dem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nstrated then and now in seeking him out, he resolved forthwith to marry her; beserching the Governour as he had ever found him affectionate to his service that in ac∣knowledgment thereof it would please him to solem∣nize his marriage, and that he might have the happy∣ness to receive a wise from so good a hand as his. The Governour readily agreed to the motion, and being on the strand, a Skiff presently carried them a∣board the Gally, where being come, the Gentleman ordered her to cover her self &amp; to sit next the Go∣vernour who was no stranger but his own wife. At it first was thought by the Governour and all present that she was his w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (as indeed she was) but by reason of her strange habit and her deportment, knowing well how to counterfeit as in the case of the Ring and little Dog, as aforesaid she remained undiscover∣ed. Dinner being ended the young Gentleman spake briskly to the Governour desiring him to bestow his Female servant on his Male, to whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the good old man replyed that it was very reasonable, and that he would do much more for his contentment; hereupon taking the Damsel by the hand, he gave her to the young Gentleman in the presence of all the com∣pany; this being done he returned to the Castle; but the Gentleman with his prey, got as far off as he could. The Governour having some little jealousie in his breast, and that which encreast it
<PB N="169" REF="104"/> more was the astonishment of the whole company to see a woman so proportion'd like the Governess; in such manner that to clear all doubts, he was no soon∣er arriv'd at the Castle but that he went straight to his Tower, and having unlockt all the doors and search'd up and down, he could not find his wife, at which he was ready to run mad; and not seeing any remdy for this calamity, there being no hopes of o∣vertaking the Gally, which was now a good way at sea, beside the confusion he was in, ei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her to speak or be spoken to, and silling his he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with a thousand things, he at length fell into dispair unimaginable, &amp; inexpressible, at length a disease seiz'd him, which took him off.</P>
<P>Who think you Sir, was guilty of his death, but his wicked wife: Wherefore all men ought to con∣sider how to govern their wives rightly; for there is nothing more difficult than to divert a woman from what she in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ends? 'Tis true if their, designs were gui∣ded by reason, I should not so much blame their subtleties by which they accomplish their con∣septions, but seeing the imperfection of the Sex, which is more usually guided by passion than reason, I can confidently say that the end of those designs they plot tends ordinarily to mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chief and danger, as may be seen in the discourse of this our <HI>Greccian,</HI> whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x∣ample need not go alone for I can instance a thou∣sand more, and I wish to God that the Empress was not rankt among them as I am certain she is, and you your self may easily discover it: Wherefore it is necessary for you to take mature deliberation in this affair without giving more credit to the passions of any other then reason shall require.</P>
<PB REF="105"/>
<P>The Emperour having given good attention to the Philosophers discourse, thought good to medi∣tate thereon: but although he had no bad opinion of his wife, yet he did abhor to think of the Death of his Son, which could not but be a great vexation to him: although he much desired that Justice might take place, and the affection which he alwayes had to acquire the reputation of a just Prince, and who would not be rash in any affair, and this induc'd him to resolve to stay the execution of his Son, until the case should be more fully and deliberately exam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned, having understood by so many examples, that all things ought not to be taken for truth, which at the first seem to be so; yet that he might somewhat please the Empress he purposed to return to <HI>Rome,</HI> so that by his presence he might shew her some rea∣son for his present delay; and thereupon without any further stay, or giving any other answer to the Phi∣lopher, but that he would take care that justice should be done, he instantly mounted on horse-back that he might the sooner perform his journy to <HI>Rome,</HI> where being arrived, he found the Empress very much en∣raged against the Officers of Justice, who being a∣broad upon their particular occasions, had been the cause of prolonging the life of Prince <HI>Erastus.</HI> This very well pleased the Emperour, finding it in his power to deliberate in the proceedings about his Son; and therefore he gave command to the Officers to forbear any further proceedings until they had fur∣ther commands from him.</P>

<HEAD>This Story or example may serve to the same purpose as the Former.</HEAD>
<P>There was a wealthy Burgess living in a certain City, who kept a Pye, the Bird he lov'd so well, that he suffered none to feed him but himself, and as he fed him taught him several Languages; this Pye was so apprehensive and grateful to his kind Master, that whatsoever he saw done in the house he told his Master.</P>
<P>This Burgess was married to a young wife, who was much more beautiful than honest, requiting her husbands love and affection with s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight and disrespect, because he was not a man of that lustful performance she expected, but that she might not want means to satisfie her amorous desires, she made choice of a man fit for her purpose, whom she alwayes sent for when her Husband was abroad about his business, that they might eat deliciously and wantonly toy one with another.</P>
<P>Now the Pye as she told her Master every thing, she observed, upon his return so particularly this junketting wantonness, and was so open mouth'd, as the report hereof did spread it self through the whole City, her Husband hereupon much troubled and grieved, upbraided her with disloyaly and charged her down right with adultry, to which she said she was innocent, and that he was to blame to belive his Pye, and that as long as he continued so doing, there would be nothing but variance and discord among them; but he reply'd the Pye could not lye, for what she saw or heard, that she told him, and therefore
<PB N="172" REF="107"/> would belive her rather than his Wife.</P>
<P>It so hapned not long after that, this Burgess tra∣velled abroad, and was no sooner gone, but she sent to advise her friend, that to avoid the suspition of the People he should come secretly to her that night, to do as he was accustomed: being come, as he en∣tred into the house, he said Dearest I fear this Make∣bait Pye will discover us, but she bid him be bold, for it was dark, and therefore the Pye could not see them; the Pye hearing this, said 'tis true, I see you not, but I can hear you, and know that you Cuckold my Master, which It shall tell him when he cometh home; at which this lusty young fellow was startled, but she bade him be of good courage, and she would be revenged of the Pye, so they went and lay together, about midnight the Adultress arose, and calling her maid-servant, commanded her to fetch a Ladder, which they did set up to the roof of the house, and having got thereto, they made a hole therein, straight over the Pye, and through it cast at the Pye, somtimes water, then small stones, sand and the like, in so much that the poor Pye was ready to dye.</P>
<P>Upon the Burgesses return h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> went to visit his Pye, asking her how she fared, and what had past in his absence, to which the Pye replyed, Master I shall sa∣tisfie you in both; first, I have strange new<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to tell you, and that is you are Cuckold, for that very night after your departure, your wife entertained a young man all night in Bed with her, notwithstanding I told them I would informe you thereof: as to my welfare, that very night <HI>I</HI> had like to have dyed it was so tempestuous, either raining, hailing, or snow∣ing upon me all night long. The wife hearing this
<PB N="173" REF="107"/> said to her husband, you have hitherto belived in the Pye, <HI>I</HI> will see whether you will continue so doing. She saith she had like to have lyed with rain, hail and snow, that night she accuseth me of adultery, where as there was never any thing clearer but my innocen∣cy, there having not been seen so lovely fair a night as that for many years, and therefore for the future belive her not. The good man to be satisfied of the truth, inquired of the Neighbours whether that night was foul or fair, who all affirmed no night cuold be fairer; then going to his wife he acknowledg'd the fault of his credulity, and after that went to his Pye, and having rail'd at him for sowing discord be∣tween man and wife, notwithstanding he had lov'd him so well, and though the Pye protested he had told him nothing but what he either saw or heard, yet he wrung his neck of, the Wife at the sight here∣of was over-joy'd, but the Husband looking up, saw a ladder, and a hole in the roof the house, and a vessel of water, sand and stones standing by, which made him soon perceive the treachery of his Wife, at which he grew so troubled to be thus deluded, and deprive his dearly beloved Pye of life, that he sold all that he had, and went a Pilgrimage. Now said the Philo∣sopher to the Emperour, was not this a false and wicked woman, by deceit and craft to cause the faith∣ful Pye to be slain, and the Emperour answered it was very true, and I much pitty the Pye, that she should dye for her fidelity, this is a good example for me, therefore this day my Son shall not dye, the Philoso∣sopher commending the prudence of the Emperour, took his leave, having first recommended him to the protection of the Almighty.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVII.</HI> The Empress <HI>Aphrodicia</HI> again induceth the Empe∣rour to proceed to the execution of Prince <HI>Erastus,</HI> by a discourse which she made to him of a great in∣convenience which befel a King of <HI>Persia,</HI> by put∣ing too much confidence in Philosophers and Wise∣men which belonged to his Court: who by means of a Phantasme which they made in a town, besieged by the <HI>Persians,</HI> and ready to be surrendred caused the Seige to be raised, to the great damage of the King, of <HI>Persia,</HI> they having taken Bribes and Presents from the Enemies.</HEAD>
<P>THE inconstancy and instability of those who loose themselves in the service of women, may be cleerly demonstrated in this example of the Em∣perour <HI>Dioclesian:</HI> who had no sooner ordained and established any thing in this case of his Son: but that at the discourse of the adverse Party he soon changed his mind: for after he had heard the Philosopher <HI>Philantropus,</HI> he resolved to examine well the fact of <HI>Erastus,</HI> and search out the truth, but being come to <HI>Rome,</HI> he was so over rul'd by the speeches of the Empress, that he gave fresh orders to proceed with∣out any delay to the execution of Prince <HI>Eastus;</HI> the

<PB REF="109"/>
<PB N="175" REF="109"/> manner thus, The Emperour went to visit the Em∣press, to acquaint her that the delay which he had caused in the case of <HI>Erastus,</HI> was not to hinder the course of Justice, nor to deferre the revenge for the abuse she had suffered: but to avoid the blame of be∣ing accounted rash and chollerick, as already several had reported him to be, in regard he had pronounced sentence without using the formes in those cases ac∣customed which ought to be freely used to the satis∣faction of every one; wherefore the execution of the sentence must be deferred for a few dayes, other∣wise he should be very much blamed in not admi∣nistring Justice according to the usual manner.</P>
<P>The Empress sighing and groaning thus answered, I deny not Sir, but that in all ordinary cases it is ne∣cessary to observe the customes of the Court; but in so extraordinry a case wherein the crime exceeds all punishments established by law: I say there it is ill to delay the punishment, but to hasten and be speedy in the execution thereof? and Sir, I pray was it ever known or read in any Chronicle or History, that any one was so audacious as only to think to force an Empress, much less to attempt it? where do you finde a Son so unnatural and wicked, as to endeavour to quench his disordinate appetite in a vessel conse∣crated to his Father, and now this great abuse is com∣mitted against one who is above all Laws and Ordi∣nances: and for him to delay the punishment, I know not what to say to it, but that you are so blinded by a Fatherly affection, that you are in a manner con∣tented with the outrage that hath been done to for the laws formerly made by Emperours were to tye up their hands, but to keep their Subj
<PB N="176" REF="110"/> within compass, and to inflict severe punishment upon those who should be found so manifest guilty as <HI>E∣rastus,</HI> who hath comitted a crime of the highest na∣ture that he could possibly be guilty of; wherefore I see that all this prolongations are to no other end, but that I should dye of grief, which will soon and easily happen to me, since you have so small esteem for my honour, and if my life be troublesome to you, wherefore do you trouble me and your self in this manner, and not kill me out-right at once; for assure your self, <HI>I</HI> shall be better pleased to dye, so it may please you, then to live in this torment I now indure.</P>
<P>At these words the Emperour could not forbear weeping, which the Empress observing, she prosecuted her discourse with greater affection than before, shew∣ing that she was not so much troubled on her one ac∣count, as in respect of him, ading that she very welknow that all these delayes about <HI>Erastus</HI> proceeded from the malignity of the Philosophers, who under pre∣tence of zeal and religion endeavoured to ruin the ho∣nour and life of the Empress; and I wish to God, said she, that it hapneth not to you as it did to a King of <HI>Persia,</HI> who having to do with the <HI>Caldeans,</HI> was in bad case, by being advised by his Philosophers as you are by these here; and although I find my self very much weakned by the continual trouble which affl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cts my poor heart, yet however I should be willing to relate the whole affair to you, were it not wholly loss of time, seeing you resolved to stop the execution of the sentence you have denounced.</P>
<P>Let not that hinder you replyed the Emperour, and <HI>I</HI> pray you (provided it does not displease you) to relate to me all that hapned to this King, and I
<PB N="176" REF="110"/> assure you that you shall see your self revenged both of <HI>Erastus</HI> and the Philosophers sooner than you ex∣pect: And thus having comforted the Empress in the best manner that he could, he so entreated her that she began her Narrative after this man∣ner.</P>
<P>In times past there was a very puissant King in <HI>Persia,</HI> (as it is usual for all the Kings of <HI>Persia</HI> to be so) who was named <HI>Psamentin:</HI> this King being de∣sirous to enlarge his Kingdom, at the first began to war upon his Neighbours, and so pursued his Victo∣ries, that in the end he having reduced all the adjoyn∣ing Countries to his command, he came to the Con∣fines of <HI>Caldea,</HI> hoping to conquer that Kingdom, as he had done the rest of their Neigbours; and there∣upon having raised a very fair Army, and being pro∣vided with all things necessary for so great an enter∣prize, he with great fury entred the Country of the <HI>Caldeans,</HI> putting all that he met to fire and sword▪ the King of <HI>Caldea</HI> who was named <HI>Achias,</HI> being informed of the great provision which the King of <HI>Persia</HI> made to assault him, caused his Nobility to be assembled, whom he acquainted with the design of the King of <HI>Persia</HI> had to subdue the Country of <HI>Caldea,</HI> and to reduce it to the obedience of the <HI>Persians,</HI> for which purpose he had raised a great Army with which he had taken the field, so that he daily expected newes of his arrival into their Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>try.</P>
<P>Representing to them that they all very well knew what Forces they c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld raise, and yet how∣ever he was resolved to maintain the fredom of his Country choosing rather to dye than to fall unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="178" REF="111"/> the Government of the <HI>Persians,</HI> whose Impieties they were sufficiently acquainted with, and did ab∣hor them for their Religion; which they could not by any means admit off, wherefore he prayed and ex∣horted every one, both particular and general to con∣sider of what expedient they should u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in that tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of so eminent danger, and that for the conservation of the Crown, a right to which he would not parti∣cularly claim, but should remit it to the General: and thereupon a Royal Throne being placed in the middle of the Counsel Chamber, he went thither and placed the Crown thereon, and then went and sate down among the rest of the Counsel, concluding his discourse thus. <HI>As for me, I shall serve the Crown, and shall not spare my life to maintain it: being assured that if every one will follow my example, and do their endeavours, we shall well enough preserve it from tyranny of the</HI> Persians.</P>
<P>This action being accompanyed with a Vehemence which the King used in his speech, did so move the hearts of the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> that laying aside the fear which they had of the <HI>Persian</HI> forces, conforming themselves to their Kings example and his vertuous heart, they all unanimously cryed out, that they would live and dye in the service and protection of the Crown, in sign whereof they took it into their hands; and having replaced it on the head of their King, they all promised and swore that they would never yield to the <HI>Persians,</HI> but that they would ra∣ther choose to dye than to fall into the power of their Enemies, praying the King to be courageous, and to advise of the necessary provisions for defence of their Country, offering themselves ready, wholly to obey all that he should enjoyn them.</P>
<PB N="179" REF="111"/>
<P>It is high time said the King to take order therein, but however it is first requisite that the Estates take care of provisions, and since you have restored me the Crown: I shall not fail to let you know by my Government the love I have alwayes had for you.</P>
<P>After several propositions on all sides, the Estates resolved to carry into the City of <HI>Hur,</HI> all the riches and wealth of the Kingdom, in regard that it was the Capitol City of the Country; and also by reason of the Fortress, and that all the Forces of <HI>Caldea</HI> should there have their general Rendevouze, to make to make head against the Enemy, for that it was im∣possible for them to meet the <HI>Persians</HI> in the open fields, whose Army was not numbred by hundreds of men, but by thousands. And thus the King of <HI>Caldea</HI> having given the best order he could in his affairs according to his power, he caused the City of <HI>Hur</HI> to be victualled and munitioned, wherein he also placed a good number of men to sustain the Seige: yet he made not so much haste, but the Enemy was entred the Country, before he had victualled the Ci∣ty of <HI>Hur</HI> as he had intended, and the Army of the <HI>Persians</HI> was so numerous both in Horse and Foot, that it seemed sufficient to Conquer not only one Citty, but all the World.</P>
<P>The <HI>Persians</HI> being entred into the <HI>Caldeans</HI> coun∣try, put all that they met to the Fire and Sword: so that the <HI>Caldeans</HI> being forced to forsake their little Towns, all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led to the Citty of <HI>Hur,</HI> being followed by their Enemies. Those who were within, seeing so great an Army without their walls, began to fear, yet in the end every one resolved to keep his Oath, and to defend themselves, purposing rather to lose their
<PB N="180" REF="112"/> lives then to yeild to the <HI>Persians,</HI> who frequently assaulted the Citty, but it was as valiently defended as assaulted. The Citty was so straitly beseiged on all sides, that it was impossible to enter it, and much less to issue out, but without great difficulty, and that by the way of the Mountain, which was adjoyning to the C tty; and thus the seige endured for several moneths, the beseigers not being able to take the Cit∣ty, nor they within to damage the beseigers; and yet they were many times assaulted, but the Fortress was so strong and so well defended, that the assaliants could gain nothing thereon, but many times they had epual losses. The seige then having continued a long time, the Victuals began to fail them within, the King understanding thereof took the number of the men, and cattel that were within the Citty, giving to every one a competent, though slender allowance, so that the beseiged k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pt themselves for some time in very good order. But the King seeing that their victuals would endure but f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> few dayes longer, he caused the Counsel to assemble, acquainting them with their condition, concluding that of two evils they must choose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ ei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her to dye by hunger in the Citty, or valiantly t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> issue out upon their Enemies; saying that although the best was bad, yet his opinion was not to dye of hunger, but like men of courage, to fall upon their Enemies, on whom they must needs make a co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>siderable slaughter, assuring them that if they beh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved themselves as he hoped they would, they should lessen the number of their Enemies, and give the rest occasion not to beast of any vi∣ctory.</P>
<PB N="181" REF="112"/>
<P>All of them approved of the Kings advice, consi∣dering the desperate condition of their aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and it was concluded that at the next new Moon (for the <HI>Caldeans</HI> reckon the increase of the Moon to be a good sign, and the decrease to be a bad sign to them) they would all issue out intending to dye in the Bed of Honour, fighting against their Enemies, and the Women declared themselves to be no less valiant, re∣solving to accompany their husbands. This conclu∣sion being taken, and every one being resolved, they all began to make merry, and give signs of joy and gladness. The <HI>Persians</HI> hearing this, and being acquain∣ted with the great want and scearcity which they with in had indured, were astonished thereat, and more particularly their Philosophers and Magitians, where∣of there were three in the Camp, who managed all the affairs of the King of <HI>Persia,</HI> so that nothing was done without their advice, for these three Philoso∣phers were reputed to be very wise and good servants to the King, yet within few dayes treason and disloy∣alty, appear in the ruin of their King, and destructi∣on of their Army.

And there∣fore not having patience, but being very desirous to satisfie their avarice, they reso ved to be Masters of some of the <HI>Caldeans</HI> treasure by one means or o∣ther, and not attaing their ende by the ruin of the Citty, which had worne out their patience by their long holding out, they therefore intended to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in it by delivering of them within, whereupon having conferred together, they all three entreated the King to permit them to depart from the Camp for some certain dayes, to cel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>brate some sacrifice, where none ought to be present but those of their quality; whereby they should discover by the communication of Spirits, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccasion of the feast, which was made by the besieged, and what means they must use to reduce them to the necessity of yeilding. To this the King consented, and withal entreated them to be diligent in their sacrifices, to the purposes aforesaid.</P>
<P>These Philosophers then leaving the Camp, pre∣vailed so with the K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng of <HI>Persia,</HI> that he promised to attempt nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gainst the Citty until their re∣turn, only to kee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it straitly besieged, and to take care of his own Camp. This being done they tra∣velled to to the Mountain, where they remained un∣til night, which being come they went towards the Citty, and being perceived by the Sentin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, who asked who goes there, and having answered that they were there for the service of the Citty, and that they should conduct them to the King to acquaint him with somwhat of importance, the Court of guard see∣ing that they were but three, permitted them to en∣ter the Citty, and having set a guard of soldiers over them, some went to the King to acquaint him of their arrival, who caused them to come presently that he
<PB N="183" REF="113"/> might know their business; they being before the King desired private audience, to this the King con∣sented, retireing into a Chamber with some Princes his favourites, and there the Philosophers began to discover and declare what they were, saying, that the great compassi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n which they had for the poor inha∣bitants of the City of <HI>Hur,</HI> had mov'd them to come thither, to advertize the King, that if they might be recompensed equal to the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eatness of their desert, and as the case required they would cause the seige to be raised, and constrain their Army to leave the Coun∣try of <HI>Caldea.</HI> The King hearing this, although he could give no credit to their promises, taking them for Traytours, yet however seeing his affairs reduced to so great extremity, that within a few dayes he should be constrained for want of victuals to fall up∣on desperate actions; he therefore would not slight this occasion, and thereupon knowing that the de∣sign of these Philosophers was only to get mony, though he was uncertain of their performance, but the better to oblidge and ingage them, he carried them in∣to the treasury, where there was so much Gold and Silver, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat it is impossible to reckon it, for the whole treasury of the Country had been brought thither for security. The Philosophers seeing this, were asto∣nished at the vastness of that treasure; and the King promised them and solemnly swore to them, to let them have what part of this treasure they pleased, in case they performed what they promised in causing the seige to be raised, and the Army to leave his Country.</P>
<P>The Philosophers being contented told the King that he should incourage his people; for within 4 days
<PB N="182" REF="114"/> the seige should by their means be raised, which they performed as you shall presently hear.</P>
<P>In the middle of the Citty of <HI>Hur,</HI> there was a very high Tow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, which not only commanded the Camp of the <HI>Persians,</HI> but also discovered all the ad∣joyning Countryes. The Philosophers intending to play their project on this Power, caused a habit to be made of a Gyant like proportion, covering the same with burning glasses, looking-glasses of Christal and other Glasses of several colours wrought together in marvalous order; after this they made two golden wings, which had as much luster as the habit, and painting two swords with Vermission, that they seemed to be bloody, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et however they shined very cleerly, they also provided several artificial fire works, which should make a great noise, and seem to be Thunder and Lightning: all things being thus pro∣vided and ordered, two of the Philosophers went out of the Citty, and went to the Mountain the same way that they came, the third remained in the Citty, to execute that which they had determined between them.</P>
<P>The next m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rning the Rascal Philosopher who staid behind, did put on the habit of gl sses, and pla∣ced the two golden wings on his shoulders, so that he could command them, and spread them as artifi∣cially as a Bird doth naturally; besides all this he put a great Crown on his head, from whence issued several bright beams or raies of divers co∣lours, having in each hand a bloody sword.</P>
<P>This done he fell to work with the wild-fire▪ making so great a noise with slashing and cracking
<PB N="185" REF="114"/> as if the whole Citty of <HI>Hur</HI> had been on fire, and in the midst of this flameing and thundring the Philosopher appeared on the top of the Tower, in the habit and equipage which I have described to you, appearing of so large a stature and size, that it succeed∣ed all humain proportions. The Sun beams struck so directly upon the Glasses, and their shineing ha∣biliments, that it dazeled the eyes of the beholders. After the Philosopher had for some space spread his wings, and sluttered with them, he began to bran∣dish and flourish with both his vermillion swords, so that the beholders supposed him to be in fight. The <HI>Persians</HI> seeing this strange and dismal sights were terrified and dismayed, not knowing what should oc∣casion it. In the midst of these passages the two other Philosophers who were in the Mountain came run∣ing and crying into the Camp, and going directly to the Kings Tent, cryed out they were all dead men, wherefore said the King? do you not see Sir, said they, the God of the <HI>Caldeans</HI> who is descended from Heaven to defend them, so that if we stay here any longer we shall be all lost; and therefore it is necessa∣ry for us to flee, lest we enrage this God any further, and thereby loose our lives as our Companion hath done, who having seen the apparition of this God, and being desirous to appease his fury with certain new Sacrifices which he would offer, was suddenly slain in the Mountain by a Thunder-bolt, which we seeing made all possible haste down hither, to acquaint you that if you do not this day depart the place, none of your Camp will escape: and thereupon they be∣gan to flee, which caused several who gave as much credit to these Philosophers, as if they had been
<PB REF="115"/> a God to follow them, and flye as well as they The King himself presently mounted on horseback, so that in one hours time the Seige was raised; The besieged who were in armes and who were ready to issue out, seeing their enemies in a Rout, fell on their Reer and charged them so briskly, that they made as great a slaughter as they pleased, and took so many Prisoners that it was wonderful, for the poor <HI>Per∣sians</HI> fled without any order, thinking that the God of the <HI>Caldeans</HI> was still behind them, so that a small number escaped, &amp; they too hastening night &amp; day out of the <HI>Caldeans</HI> Country. The pursuit being finished which lasted untill night, the <HI>Caldeans</HI> returned to their City being all rich &amp; more contented, for all the baggage of the <HI>Persians</HI> was left in the Camp, where∣by the <HI>Caldeans</HI> had the Pillage which was of an in∣esteemable value. The Philosophers faceing about took the way of the Mountain, and from thence returned to the City of <HI>Hur</HI> where they were high∣ly welcomed, and the King of the <HI>Caldeans</HI> kept his promise with them, having by their cunning device and tricks defeated the King of <HI>Persia</HI> who was their Master, and had turned the victory to the <HI>Caldeans</HI> side, and that for covetousness of the Treasure which was delivered to them.</P>
<P>And thus Sir, (continued the Empress) will it happen to you if you prevent if not: For I foresee that you lending your ears to these Phi osoph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs, and not taking heed to their device, and following their wicked &amp; pernicious counsel as you d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, they will occa∣sion your death &amp; will enstall their <HI>Erastus</HI> with the Emperiall Crown▪ that they may divide among them∣selves the Treasure of <HI>Rome;</HI> but I beseech God to

<P>And thus having finished her discourse, she began to sigh groan and weep, so that the Emperour himself could not refrain from weeping; and after he had comforted her as much as he could, he said take no care for this Madan, for I am too well in Instructed to be over-reached with all their cunning; and to give you the more satisfacton I have purposed that to morrow morning <HI>Erastus</HI> shall be executed without any further delay, and he being dispatch justice shall soon after proceed to the punishment of these who have brought him to so pittiful an end by their bad Instructions: At which speeches the Empress being somewhat app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ased they went to bed together, but the Empress found this nighr to be as long as the precedent wherein she the next morning expected news of her son-in-laws death.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVIII</HI> The Philosopher <HI>Agathus,</HI> put a stop to the execution of <HI>Erastus</HI> by his oppinion upon a Letter which a Queen of <HI>Germany</HI> had written to the Emperour, to cause her husband to be put to death; alledging in confirmation of his oppinion the Story of a Gentle∣man of <HI>Modena,</HI> whose wife did cut his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hroat that she might have a young man whom she loved, she ha∣ving before endeavoured to kill him by several ways, and means wherein she had failed.</HEAD>
<P>THE Emperour being willing to lye with the Em∣press, in s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me manner to appease her, did perceive soon after midnight (he being so continually troub∣led in mind that he could not take his natural rest) several people who talked very loud in the with∣drawing Room of the Empr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss; and having asked of the women of the Empresses Bed-Chamber wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter, one of them entred the Chamber, and presented a Letter to the Emperour, saying that one of the Gentleman of his Chamber had brought it, and had charged her to deliver it suddenly, accor∣ding to the desire of a Messenger who was come from <HI>Germany</HI> in Post, who said he was commanded by those that sent him, to cause it to be instantly read to the Emperour in regard it was of importance for the Conservation of the Empire, further saying that

<PB N="189" REF="117"/> the lowd talking the Emperour had heard was in ar∣guing the case with the Messenger, whether it was absolutely necessary to deliver the Letter presently; doubting there might be danger in staying till the Emperour did rise, and for fear they should presently awake him.</P>
<P>The Emperour having seen the contents of the Letter, which required suddain consideration and yet mature deliberati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, commanded that the cheif of the Senators sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld be assembled, in the mean time he arose, (for it w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s not long to day) and went only habited in his night gown to meet the Senators, in the Empresses Hall, among others the Philoso∣phers were al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o called to this counsel, whose pre∣sence although it some what displeased the Emperour by reason of <HI>Erastus,</HI> yet however he was very well contented that they should be present at this Counsel; to see h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w much they would surpass the others in readiness of advice. The Counsel being then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssemb∣led &amp; all others being turned out, but such as belonged to the Counsel, the Emperour acqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inted them with the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use why he had caused them to meet, and after he had spent some time in discoursing ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut the pre∣sent affair, be commanded one of his S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cretaries to read the Letter from the Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en of <HI>Germany,</HI> the contents whereof followeth.</P>
<Q><P><HI>HEliodora</HI> Queen of <HI>Germany,</HI> to <HI>Dioclesia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Em¦perour of the <HI>Romans</HI> greeting; the horror which <HI>I</HI> naturally have against any thing contrary to my duty joyn'd to the faith <HI>I</HI> owe to the <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>man</HI> Empire, not only in respect of the general obligation which this king∣dom hath as being a dependant on the said Empire, but also by a particular affection of my Family which is an∣tiently descended from the illustrious blood of the Romans
<PB N="190" REF="118"/> hath constrained me to send you this Letter, without respecting and having little regard to the great danger and hazard of my life, in case of discovery that the ad∣vertisement which I send you should come from me, preferring this advice which only tends to the preser∣vation of the great <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, before my own life.</P>
<P>Know then that the King <HI>Erastus</HI> my husband, who at first shewed himself very affectionate to the service of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, from whom he holds his Crown, is so altered in his latter age, that he endeavours nothing more than your ruin, and the destruction of <HI>Rome,</HI> and yet I am ignorant of the occasion. To com∣pass which ends, he daily endeavours to draw to his o∣pinion, the most dexterously that he can the cheif, and Governours of the Countries adjoyning to this King∣dom. Nay hath many intelligences and secret practi∣ses in <HI>Italy▪</HI> by which means he may on a suddain raise a great and strong army to surprise you unprovided; and by this means to abuse the granduer of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire. And this he may easily perform (if you pre∣vent him not) by the great number of men which he can raise in these Countries, who are very strong and brave warriours as every one knowes. And therefore you are not only to advise how to defend your self, but to think of Chastiseing his rashness; so that he may serve as an Example to other Princes, who shall be so hold as to rebel against the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, and to maintain <HI>Rome</HI> in its greatness.</P>
<P>Now to think of chasting him by force of Arms, as the case requires, it will be very difficult▪ and in a man∣ner impossible, for as you very we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> know our <HI>Germans</HI> are so valiant, that all the Forces of your Empire, which
<PB N="191" REF="118"/> <HI>I</HI> confess are very great, yet they would be to weak to subdue and conquer this Nation. Wherefore that which cannot be done by force, may more easily be per∣formed by cunning which if you leave the management to me? <HI>I</HI> will deliver this disloyal King to you either alive or dead: provided that you warrant me in the action, and will take me into your protection, and that of your Em∣pire, to which I account my self so much obliged, that I rather choose to keep faith with you, than with him, to whom my person is obleiged some years since: where∣fore expecting Letters of assurance on your part, you may be confident of the sincerity of my heart towards you and your Empire, which I will manifest to you in short time, more by effect than words, <HI>Fare you well.</HI></P></Q>
<P>This Letter being read in full Counsel, and the importance of the affair being well considered, they were devided in their opinions, some advised that <HI>Rome</HI> ought presently to be fortyfied, so that the E∣nemies might have little mind to come and beseige a place so well provided; others on the contrary said that this was not correspondent to the grandeur of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire▪ and that this would demonstrate their fear, which would be a thing contrary to the honour and reputation of the <HI>Roman</HI> People, who ha∣ving been Conquerers of the World, would not seem to fear the barbarous <HI>Germans,</HI> without great pre∣judice to their honour; and therefore concluded that a potent army should be raised, and led withal ex∣pedition to chastise the rashness of those who had not only presumed to rebel, but also had sworn the ruin of the Empire.</P>

And therefore knowing that the said Letter was composed of falsities and impossible things, he concluded that no regard should be had thereto; for although the King of <HI>Germany</HI> should bear such intentions against the Empire, (which he could not believe, esteeming all that the Queen had written to be false,) yet he could not on a suddain raise such an Army, but that their Allies, nay the Governours of the <HI>Roman</HI> Provinces would have knowledg <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f it, who would give such timely notice thereof at <HI>Rome,</HI> that they might be well enough pro∣vided to stop their pass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge, more especially at the <HI>Alps.</HI> And now said he, these things being thought to be probably false, it will be necessary to resolve a doubt, which is this, what should be the cause, and what should move the Queen to write this Letter, and thereby to caluminate her Husband. As to this, the contents of the Letter being considered, the resolu∣tion is very plain, and in short is her Husbands age, for there is nothing more displeasant to a young wo∣man than to lye by an old mans side; so that if Na∣ture do not take them away as soon as they have a minde to it, they never leave then to study some way how to dispateh them, and I wish to God that their case would alwayes prove as it did with a Damsel of <HI>Modena,</HI> whose story I shall willingly relate, which may serve as well to this purpose as another, if I did not doubt to displease the Counsel with my tedious∣ness, no, no replyed the Emperour, proceed and you shall very much please me, for time cannot be better imployed than in hearing those things, from whence
<PB N="195" REF="120"/> we may learn some good and profitable doctrine; whereupon the Philosopher prosecuting his discourse thus began.</P>
<P>In times past at <HI>Modena</HI> one of the famousest Ci∣ties in <HI>Italy,</HI> there was a Gentleman one of the Principal of his Country, who having spent his youthful dayes in the study of learning, and in seve∣ral other exercises fitting his degree and quality, without subj ct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng himself to the yoak of wedlock, being arrived to a declension in years, purposed to marry, as well out of complyance to the desiers of his friends, as out of an effection to leave some issue behind him: and thereupon he took a woman his e∣qual in riches, and the greatness of his Family, but much different in age, he being well stricken in years, and she entring into the flower of her age, who ha∣ving lived with him for some time, and having had some experience of the World, she understood that although she had plenty of all manner of worldly goods, yet she wanted a full enjoyment of that one thing which women most principally covet; and un∣derstanding that her Husband could not give her a full satisfaction, she purposed to look out for it else where, so that by the assistance of her Chamber-maid, she contracted love with a young man, and having had tryal of his youth, she so entirely placed her af∣fection on him, that she not only enjoyed him in pri∣vate, but was not ashamed to own him before all the World. But knowing that this could not be done without great scandal so long as her husband live<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> she therefore endeavoured to dispatch her old Husband out of the way that she might be Married to this young one, who for his par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="196" REF="121"/> loved her with an equal affection, hoping that it would not be long ere they had both their wishes ac∣compl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shed, in regard that the old man could not by the course of Nature live much l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nger.</P>
<P>These two Lovers having sevaral times discoursed upon this subj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct, with a recip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ocal promise of a c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣stancy in aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction, the young woman at length re∣solved to hasten that which Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure had so long de∣ferred, which the young man understanding, he told her that although he should be pleased with her hus∣bands death, yet it was necessary to consider that this hastning might wholy hinder that which they so earnestly desired, for in c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>using the old man to dye of a vio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent death, Justice would take such an ac∣count of it, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t he should be forced to forsake his Country to save his life, or to suffer a shameful death; by that means losing the pleasure which they had al∣ready tasted, and of which they hoped in time to have a full inj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yment. Upon this discourse the young wo∣man did in part moderate her rage, yet however she endeavoured to attain her ends, but yet so as it might be thought he dyed of a natur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l death. And thereupon being acquainted with an old woman, who like many others commit much wickedness under the vaile of devotion, she learned of her the receipt of a cer∣tain powder made of the roots of Herbs, and many o∣ther ingredients, which being taken either in <HI>Bolus,</HI> or Licquor, would cause a burning Feaver, and having provided this powder, she administred it to her Hus∣band, hoping that the Phisitians judging this Feaver did proceed from bad humours, would cause her hus∣band to be purged by means of which purgation and his weakness the Physick would bereave him of his
<PB N="197" REF="121"/> life. The powde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> performing its operation, put the poor Gentleman into a Feaver, which he being sensi∣ble of, sent for an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld well experienced Phisitian who having examined his Patient, and found by his an∣swers that he had not at all disordered himself; he at∣tributed the cause of his distemper to his age; and in regard he had a young woman to his wife, whereupon he was of opinion that in straining himself more than his age would admit, to pleasure his young wife, he had caused this Feaver to seize on him, and there∣fore he concluded not to purge him either with Me∣dicines r G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ysters, believing that a restorative would be more pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>per for the conservation of his Radical moisture, than to weaken him further by evacuation, seeing him already feeble enough, as well in respect of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> age, as in regard of his straining himself with his wife.</P>
<P>The poor Gentleman having remained several dayes in this condition, his wicked wife failed not to let him taste often of her powder, sometimes she gave it him in Broth, and other times after some other manner, that she might continue him in his Feaver, but finding that this caused him only to languish and not dispatch him as she intended (for the restaurative which the Phisitian administrd to him was of such vertue, that it exceeded the malignity of the Feaver, and maintained his radical temper) wherefore she de∣termined to make use of absolute poyson, to effect that which neither Age nor his distemper could per∣forme, and so as it might be supposed that his Feaver only did occasion his death; and there∣upon having purchased some strong Poyson, She mixed it with some Broth which she gave
<PB N="198" REF="122"/> gave him as a restaurative. But fortune was at that instant so favourable to the old man, that taking the Porringer with trembling hands, he chanced to let it fall, and it became a Medecine to the Cat, which soon lick'd it up; the woman was very angry at this ac∣cident (pretending her displeasure to be at the loss of so precious a restaurative) and having thus spent all her Poyson, for resolving to make fair work she had given him as much poyson as would have killed a do∣zen: Wherefore that being lost, she was necessitated to give him of the true restaurative, by vertue of which the good Gentleman recovered his former health, the powder which the old she Devil had pro∣vided being likewise all spent. Whereupon the wick∣ed woman was mad with anger, and therefore resol∣ved whatever might happen to di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>patch him out of the way; she therefore procured a sleepy potion and gave it him one night at Supper, so that the poor man be∣gan to sleep as he sate at the Table. His wife per∣ceiving that, to express her kindness to her husband, she undressed him for bed where she purposed he should take his last sleep, and having pulled off his Clothes she very gently laid him on his Bed: In the mean time her Paramour being sent for, he attended her in an adjoyning Chamber, where they were used to meet together. She soon left her husband asleep to go to her waking friend, in whose company she took her pleasure, and having enflamed him to a height, she fell upon the discourse of the long life of her husband, and understanding that her young Lover was as much troubled as her self, she told him that if he had courage enough to do one thing which
<PB N="199" REF="122"/> she would d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rect, he might be assured to have a full and free enjoyment of that which they had so long and so earnestly desired, and expect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, and therefore she pressed him to execute her desires. The young man who little thought of the wicked purposes of his Mistress, being willing to content her as it is usual for young men, told her that there was nothing so difficult but he wound enterprize for her se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vice. He making this protestation to his Mistress, she made him swear to performe it; after which she tooke him by the hand and led him into the Chamber, where the good man was in a found sleep, and being approached near the Bed, she put a naked Dagger into his hand saying: Behold him who hath so long hindred the ac∣complishment of our desires, he is fast asleep, and will be so for these four hours, for so eff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctual is the slee∣py potion <HI>I</HI> have given him, you have therefore the means of dispatching him from troubling us both and therefore I pray keep promise with me, and let this Dagger be instrumental in conveying him thither where long since he ought to have been. The young man was startled and troubled at these words of his Mistress, and although he loved her very well and a∣bove all things desired the death of the Gentleman, that he might be married to her; yet however he was seized with horror and compassion to see this antient Gentleman who was in great esteem throughout <HI>Mo∣dena,</HI> to be thus cruelly dealt with by his wife; some∣times in one manner, and then after in an other, so that the consideration hereof having seized on his Spirits, being in amaze he let fall the Dagger; which this wicked and obstinate woman tooke up saying
<PB N="200" REF="123"/> since your weakness and Coward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ze hinders you from executing what you ought, you shall see that I am Mistress of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re resolu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion and courage than you; and lifting up the Dagger she cut the poor mans throat, who was so fast asl ep by vertue of the p <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion, that without waking he went to sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ep in the other World.

<P>The young man approved of the Counsel of this Murdress, and thereupon they wraped the body in the bloody Clothes, and carryed it unto an unfrequented place without the City where wery few persons pas∣sed; and having digged a hole and buried him, they concluded that for the future nothing could hinder them in their Loves, but the young man was still somewhat doubtful, and according to their agree∣ment they went to the Country to prosecute their intentions which would certainly have taken the ef∣fect; the lewd woman intended had it not been for an extraordinary accident which was not thought of, and did discover all the treason.</P>
<P>This antient Gentleman had bred up a Dog which always attended him: This dog followed the Litter wherein the woman was carried to the Country-house, supposing that his Master was also with her. But being come to the Village and n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t finding his Ma∣ster there, he returned to the City and having hunted and sought over all the house, not leaving the least Corner untrodden; he according to the nature of Dogs began to smell and sent out his Master, and to find the place where they had conveyed his Masters body, and in conclusion he hunted so long over all the fields, that he came to the place where he was bu∣ried; &amp; three he stayed putting his nose to the ground he scented his Masters body: whereupon this poor C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rr began to howle for his Master, and that in such pittiful manner that many who passed that ways stop∣ped at this howling, although this was the Common lestal for the whole city: &amp; the dog did so scratch &amp; claw with his feet that having remov'd some earth he discover'd one corner of the bloody cloth wch he en∣deavor'd to pul out with his teeth forbearing to tear it
<PB N="202" REF="124"/> as if he feared to hurt his Masters body, and thus did he continue and encrease his howling. This the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssengers seeing and observing the pains which the Dog took with the bloody Cloath, which be endea∣voured to draw out, they therefore resolved to see what it was; the poor Dog looking sometimes upon one, and then upon another, as if he asked their assistance, fawing on those that helped him to dig, and flying on those who would hunt him away, as if he had resolved to defend this Pit even to the death; so that in conclusion people came with spades and shovels, and digging found the body wrapped up in bloody cloathes. The good Dog seeing his Masters body, began to lick it so that he cleansed it from the blood wherewith it was besmeared, and yet for all that none knew the body; the news hereof being carried through <HI>Modena,</HI> caused that many and some of the Chief of the Citty went to see it, among the rest several of the Murthered Gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lemans Relations, who first knew the body by the Dog, before they knew the Dog by his Master, whose body was very much disfigured. The Governour of the place having notice hereof, being a wise and understanding Person, examined the particulars of all; and being told that the Wife of the deceased was young, and the man old; he thereupon conject<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red the truth of the mat∣ter, whereupon he sent Officers to the Place where the Woman had reported her Husband was gone for change of Air. The wretched Woman who was re∣turned to <HI>Modena,</HI> hearing the noise about the Dogs and the body that was found, was about to flee, but the Officers came timely enough to seize on her and secure her and her wicked Chamber-maid; she seeing
<PB N="203" REF="124"/> her self taken and bound, and knowing in whose custo∣dy she was, freely confessed the fact, saying she very well knew the cause why she was taken, and particu∣larly related how she had used her deceased Husband that she might be rid of him, and how she had kill'd him with her own hands, whereupon she was led to the Governour, where she reiterated and confirmed her disposition, further adding that she repented she had endured so much, and that she had delayed his death so long, and that if it were to do again she would do it.</P>
<P>The Governour hearing this, being much troubled to see so fair a young woman so obstinate in her wickedness, which she did not endeavour to excuse, but rather to justifie, he therefore condemned her to be burnt alive, at the common place of Execution in <HI>Modena,</HI> and that her Chambermaid who had not only kept her counsel, but bin her assistant and com∣panion should also suffer with and accompany her in death, and this sentence was the next day executed, this wretched woman not shewing the least repen∣tance for so wicked a crime.</P>
<P>And this may be the very case of the Queen of <HI>Germany,</HI> for I am very confident, that no cause hath induced her thus miserably to calumniate the King her Husband, but only an earnest desire to have him dispatched out of her sight. True it is this woman is more cunning, &amp; endeavours to have more assurance then she of <HI>Modena,</HI> for she would be assured of the protection and safeguard of the Empire▪ that she may with more safety execute her wicked design▪ wherefore my opinion is that she ought not to be protected in so wicked an action, but that in short an

<P>Our Gentleman understanding the resolution of the Mistress, was as I told you married to the Maid, by which action he thought to vex the Lady which slighted him, and marry her who loved him, and that he might make the Lady and all the World believe they were mistaken in him, and that his Estate was as good as ever, he lanched out all that he could to make a sumptuous wedding, so that by such time as h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and his Brides cloathes were paid for, and the o∣ther expences defrayed, not only his own Estate was consumed, but all his new wives ready money which she had pickt up in her service was spent, and besides one Citty house and some moveables, all else was sold, and the money wasted, all the Treasure he could boast of was his wives beauty which was indeed ad∣mirable, and so attractive that it brought her many servants and adorers, but she who was vitious enough in other matters as you shall understand ere long was virtuous in preserving her chastity for him alone who
<PB N="208" REF="128"/> who had paid so dear for it, and refused the embra∣ces of all her Lovers for her husband.</P>
<P>They who courted her, finding that amorous language and handsome treats would not work upon her, and partly understanding her husbands condition to be necessitous, resolved to take an other course, and pre∣sented her with rings, plate, and some trifling jewels, which she accepted of, and than gave them the hear∣ing, but yet stood out as to the main, and wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d not admit of any neer approaches, resolving since they had begun with presents that they should proceed in the same manner, and that if they had injoyment, it should be a costly one, as indeed in the end it proved to be. Many of these suiters she had, (all which she held in hand so long as they brought grift to her Mill) but the principal were three <HI>Roman</HI> Knights, who having large revenues, not only spent largely, but presented her very roundly that they might have a lick at her honey p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</P>
<P>Her husband was no such Novice in these affairs, but that he understood what was meant by this court∣ship, but being confident of his wiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s chastity, (who indeed acquainted him with all her proceedings, and permitted him to share in her profits) he therefore was contented, and advised with her how to manage her affairs to the best advantage; so that the 3 Knights becoming imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtuna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uiters, and besides the pre∣sents off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring her fair in moneys, she at length made a bargain with them she managed each of them seve∣rally, not one knowing the design of the other, though they were all very well known to each other, yet this was a secret they discovered not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any, she having engaged them so to doe for
<PB N="209" REF="128"/> preservation of her honour.</P>
<P>The some she agreed upon was 200 Crowns of each of them they were to pay, and fare all alike, and to be entertained all at one and the same time and place. The appointed time being come, and one of the Knights having entred her house, and delivered the mony ready told, her husband was ready to re∣ceive him, but in a fatal manner with a naked sword running him through so often, that he sunk down dead on the ground, the first being thus di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>patched, it was not long after before the second came, who fared no better than the first, and the third also was forced to bear his friends company in death.</P>
<P>Thus did these three Knights fall inglorlously, and instead of pleasure they intended, they purchased a suddain death, and these two murderers were proud of their prize and conquest, believing that they had done well in preserving their honor, and supposing that if the world were acquainted with the whole matter they might well enough justifie the fact, yet however they were willing and desirous to conceal it, and to that purpose they contrived a way how to be rid of the dead bodies.</P>
<P>The murdress had a Brother who was Commander of the watch of the whole Citty, and with some attendants, such as he thought fit to choose from a∣mong the rest, he went the Rounds, and visited the several watches, he being in his Circuit was called in by his Sister, who gave him and his crew a sufficiant quantity of strong liquor, and keeping them in k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n house so long that it was too late to pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in his walk she desired him to send away hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Attendants; and that she had a private h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="210" REF="129"/> private business to impart to him. He consented to what his loveing Sister desired, and they being gone, she tells him that she hath somewhat to impart that he must be very secret in, and withal assist her in or else she was undone; he not questioning the matter what, makes her an absolute general promise to do all things she would desire, she having thus assured him, she tells him a Knight of the Emperours Court came that day into her house, and intended an abuse to her but was hindred by her husband, who by chance ar∣rived and being Cholerick and the other desperate, they so far engaged together that her husband ha∣ving the Juster cause overcame and slew his enemy whose body remained there in the house unburied, and that without his assistance they knew not how to convey it away. Well Sister replyed he I will rid you of that trouble; help me to a Sack and <HI>I</HI> will put the body into it and carry it on my back and throw it into the River <HI>Tiber,</HI> whose streams will quickly convey it into the Sea, so that you shall hear no more of it.</P>
<P>His Sister did as he required, and desired him by all means to return thither again, so soon as he had done what he promised: He accordingly did as he had said and soon returned, bidding her take no more care for by that time the body was carried far enough by the violence of the stream, she hearing him say so fetched him a cup of the best liquor her house afford∣ed, but pretending some business in the next Room to that where they were drinking, she went thi∣ther? but hastily and as it were in amaze returned crying out, Oh Lord! Brother I am undone; for the Knight which you so lately carryed to the River is
<PB N="211" REF="129"/> returned and lyes here: How said he, it is impossible; but going thither he there found the body of a dead Knight, whom he supposed was as she told him the former returned. Well said he give him me again, and I will try what can be done and now make sure work, for <HI>I</HI> will throw him in again Sack and all and a great stone tyed to it; having aid thus he takes the body puts it into his Suc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> layes it on his shoulders, and carries it where he had said; and returned saying, now Sister assure your self I have secured all well e∣nough, for <HI>I</HI> saw the body sink to the very bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om: therefore fill the other dish of liquor and let us be merry. She did as he desired and they drank on, but not long before she made the same excuse as formerly, and came running and frighted, crying out that the Knights body was again returned.</P>
<P>Her Brother hearing her speeches and seeing a dead body (which indeed was of the third Knight though she said it was the first) was much am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d concluding that this Knight was borne under some Planet whose influence was such that the water should not prejuduce him, wherefore he resolved to take another course, and try what the fire would do: therefore he puts it into a Sack and carryes it to a place without the Citty where there was much Wood, this he put together in such manner a∣bout the dead body that it might be consumed He having placed all things in order, and set fire to the Wood, retired a little out of the way to do the deed of Nature.</P>
<P>In the mean time, it growing towards morning a Knight who was Journeying to the Emperour
<PB N="212" REF="130"/> Court, chanched to ride that way, and seeing a fire the weather being cold &amp; raw, he drew near to it to warm himself, and in this posture did our Over-seer of the watch finde him when he returned, whereupon he asked what he was, a Knight replyed the Traveller, you are a Devil and no Knight said the Over-seer, for I first carried you into the River and threw you in, but you returned, I then again threw you in sack and all with a stone, but you still returned, and then I finding that the water had no power over you, tryed what the fire could do and intended here to burn you, but I think to no purpose, for I see you are come out again, yet I will once again try what I can do, and thereupon he seized on the travelling Knight, and threw him horse and all into the fire, and their stayed tell they were burned.</P>
<P>By this time it was day, and he having done his work throughly as he beleived, returned to his Sisters house, telling her what he had done, and how that at last he threw him and horse too into the fire, she seemed to admire at it, and was very well contented with the story, and having treated her Brother with good drink and victual, and many thanks she per∣mitted him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,</P>
<P>Thus did the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> woman perform this enter∣prize, coming off with flying colours, and the bag∣gage of the field, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hree considerable baggs of money which was very welcome to her and her husband, to price up their broken fortunes, and thus did she often times g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t many of her several woers, till at last she came off with loss, and thus it was.</P>
<PB N="213" REF="130"/>
<P>Among her many lusty woers, she had one a little dapper fellow for her servantt by profession a Law∣yer, he having a moneths mind to be dabling with her, made his addresses to that purpose, he was rich and prodigal, she covetuous and a niggard of her favours which must be purchased at a dear rate; he had tryed the vertue of his tongue, but it had no vertue at her bar without that which caused it to speak at the Judges, ready m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was used to oyle his tongue, and that must be produced before she would give the comfortable word you shall have your desire; but in the end he agreeing to give her what she desired she consented, but she intended it not, for of all men she liked not this Handy-prat Lawyer; and therefore intended to serve him as she had done the three Knights.</P>
<P>She acquainted her Husband with her design, who was willing enough to assist and take part in the pain, because he was to take part in the gain.</P>
<P>It was a tall sum she agreed upon, 300 crowns which she pretended she would only borrow for some time, but designed never to pay; the time being come the poor Lawyer came to the place her own house, and delivered the money, but so soon as he at∣tempted to take his pleasure with her, he had it with a vengeance, with a lusty blow laid on between his neck and shoulders, with a large cudgel that set him a sprawling, as it used to do Conies, there needed not many blows, nor no sword to dispatch him, that one with the staff was sufficient; so that he soon kickt up his heele, and went to plead causes in the other world.</P>
<PB N="214" REF="131"/>
<P>They being certain of his death, consulted what to do with his body, which not being wounded, they resolved on this case, the murdering Husband took him on his back and carried him to the back side of the Lawyers own house, which was not far distant, and there being a house of office in the yard, he set him down on the fear, as if he had been there easeing his body, and thus having placed him; he there left him, and went home,</P>
<P>The Lawyer had a companion and bed-fellow who was acquainted with his love story, and knew of that nights appointment and therefore did sit up for him, he having occasion to visit the house of Office, ope∣ning the door saw one sitting there, although he could not imagine who it should be, yet out of modesty he retired for some time, but attending somewhat longer than ordinary, and seeing the Party did not come out he again opened the door, and making a neerer ap∣proach perceived that it was his friend the Lawyer: he wondred at his being there, supposing he was in an another place, wherefore he called him by his Name▪ but received no answer; he then believing him to be asl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ep, and resolving to awake him, pulled him by the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ftly, and then so rudely that he fell on the flo r, he seeing that, upon a little fur∣ther search found that he was dead.</P>

<P>Our Murderer understanding this, perceaving that they were gone, came from the place where he had stood up, and examining the Sack, found there was in it two flitches of Bacon, he was not long in resolving what to do, but taking the Bacon out of the Sack, put the dead man into it, and placing it on the stall went home laden with the Bacon.

This amazed them all, but the Vint∣ner more especially, who cryed out they had mur∣thered his Neighbour; who was well known to him, and indeed to all the Citty: they were as much sur∣prized as he, and knew not at first what to say, but although he threatned to secure them as murtherers, yet in conclusion they over-rul'd and perswaded him to be patient, and told him all they knew of the story, and that they took it for Bacon, and had it in such a place▪ a Chandlers back house, which indeed they had plan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red, and that thither they would carry it again.

The Chandler at whose house they had left the body did that morning call up his servant

The servant agreeing to what his Master said, intending to do so, but falling into company who went the same way, he had not the opportunity to do it all the way he rode to the Mill, so that being come thither, and having de∣livered his Sack of Corn to the Miller, he then hunted about to finde a place where to put the dead body.

The Miller was secured as owning the Sack and Meale, and our murdress and her husband, although they would have slunk their necks out of the Coller and denyed what she had said, yet they also were seized on and carried before the Justice.</P>
<P>The noise of this accident was soon spread through all the Citty, and came to the eares of our Lawyers Chamberfellow, who knowing somewhat of the truth of the matter, went to the Justices to hear what would be said of the Whole; but there was little proof of any thing, till he declared that he knew his Companion the dead Lawyer, went the foregoing evening to the house of the murdress whom I may now truly call so; she being supposed to be guilty therefore she and her husband were both committed to Jayle, and being seperated and put into several Prisons and strictly examined; it was not long be∣fore she confessed the whole fact, and also accused her husband for murthering the afore mentioned three Knights, so that just<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce taking place, they were both sentenced to dye and accordingly executed.</P>
<P>Thus although this woman pretended to a great height of vertue in preserving her Chastity, yet was she guilty of a greater crime murher; which was the loss of all who had any converse with her. Therefore we ought not to give credit to every seeming vertue, for some Vice may exceed it.</P>

<PB N="221" REF="135"/> delaying the execution of <HI>Erastus,</HI> so that the mise∣rable Princess who thought of nothing but the death of her Son in law, doubted of that which had hapned; wherefore that she might be informed of the truth, she sent for one of the Secretaries, whom she had preferred to the Emperours service, of whom she enquired a particular account of what had passed that morning. The Secretary gave her a full answer, freely relating all that had been said and concluded on, so that by this means the Empress was adver∣tized not only how it was endeavoured to bring the cause to the hearing of the Senate, but also all that the Philosopher <HI>Agathus</HI> had so freely spoken against her; whereupon she was very much enraged, and conceived as much anger against the Philosophers, as she had against <HI>Erastus,</HI> purposing not to desist until she caused them all to suffer dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, that she might be fully revenged on them, wherefore contriving in her brain a thousand m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chinations and treasons as mis∣chievous as she could imagine, she expected all that day when the Emperour should come to visit her.</P>
<P>And having understood that he arrived late, and had not (according to Custome) come to see her, and discourse with her, she became des∣perately angry, and having for some time con∣tinued so, but knowing that she lost time, in ex∣pectation of the Emperour, she therefore resolved to go to him,</P>
<P>Having staid till every one was retired, she be∣ing accompanied by two of her Damsels, went to the Emperours Chamber just as he was going to bed.</P>
<P>There she began to sigh and cry, and make the greatest complaints in the world; she having (as she
<PB N="222" REF="136"/> said) performed all dutiful love to her Husband, as to her soveraign Lord, yet she was so unfortunate, that (although a reciprocal love was pretended) she was mocked, and she believed hated, as might be easily conjectured by the effects: for instead of re∣venging the injury had been done to her, he had not only favoured him that had deserved the punishment, but also hearkned to the Counsels of those who had occasioned all this evil; by pretence of defending their Disciple by false inventions, and fraudulent speeches had not forborn to speak unworthily of her, and accuse her of that which she never so much a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dreamt of, and had been so confident as to perswade the Emperour that she had caused and procured that against him, which he with his own eyes had seen acted against her; much wondering that he should so much debase himself, as before his Counsellors to appear so friendly to these traiterous Philosophers, who made no difficulty; so much to work on his easiness, as to perswade him that black was white; further adding that she valued not how much she suf∣fered in the opinion of all the world, so long as she enjoyed his love and good opinion; which she sound would be difficult to continue, by means of these mens venemous tongues, who endeavoured to possess him with an evil opinion of her. But she still hoped he would do her justice, in punishing those who had so highly prejudiced her honour; telling him that if he should refuse that justice, she could easily have it by other means; for her Relations being advertized of the great outrages that these Philosophers had spoken against her, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld not let them pass unpu∣nished, but would execute such vengeance as the per∣sumption
<PB N="223" REF="136"/> and rashness of these Calumniators, and the greatness of her house did require; nay, she did not question but their revenge would reach against <HI>E∣rastus</HI> himself, in regard he had been so backward in executing justice for the great wrong which more in∣trenched upon his honour than hers. But especially if he should hinder the course of justice, as he had done in only condemning, and rather giving him the means of escaping by this delay, and permitting him to live, to the great scandal of the Empire; and truly (continued she) I foresee to my great grief, that in the conclusion these wicked men will execute their mal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gnity against your person, to the ruin and de∣struction of the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmon-wealth, and it will happen to you as it did to <HI>Philarchus</HI> King of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> whose story I would relate to you, if <HI>I</HI> thought that my true discourse would b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as effectual with you, as those false ones of the Philosophers.</P>
<P>The Emp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur having considered of the complaints of the Empress, made many excuses, assuring her that the delaying the execution of <HI>Erastus</HI> was not in any respect of any desire he had to hinder the course of justice wch-she intended should proceed not only a∣gainst his son, but also against those who having the charge of instructing him in g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od learning and good manners, had it couraged him by their wicked instru∣ctions, to commit that lewdness which they had seen, and who under pretence of defending him, had spoken so ignominiously against her vertue: but that the Se∣nate had so pressed him, that he had not power to de∣ny that which the Laws grant to all Criminals, that is to give them time to justifie and defend themselves, and although <HI>Erastus</HI> had already had six dayes time
<PB N="224" REF="137"/> to defend himself, during which time he had heard nothing absolute to signify that what he was accused of was not true, as indeed it was, he therefore purposed not to delay it any longer, desiring the Empress <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o de∣pend upon his word, that in a very short time she should be revenged of all the wrongs she had re∣ceived either of <HI>Erastus</HI> or the Philosophers; and therefore he prayed her to relate the story of the King <HI>Philarchus,</HI> which was a great Novelty to him, who had never heard any thing thereof; neither had he read any thing thereof in any History, assuring her that as to his great trouble, he had been constrain∣ed in full Senate to hear the calumnious discourses of the Philosopher <HI>Agathus,</HI> so on the other side he should take as great pleasure in hearing the Nar∣rative of <HI>Philarchus.</HI></P>
<P>Although the Empress would not at first consent to give the Emperour this satisfaction, making excu∣ses that she might cause the Emperour to be the more earnest, yet in conclusion after much importunity she began as followeth.</P>
<P>All people do very well know the great renown which in times past was had of the Citty of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> as well by reason of the Antiquity thereof, as for the famous University that was there: where all manner of learning did flourish, and out of this furth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r re∣spect and consideration that the Inhabitants of that Citty had by force of arms subdued not on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y all the Island, but also the greatest part of the adjoy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Countries.</P>
<P>There were many rare things in the Island, but principally two that were admirable and profitab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e was of great use and service to the poor, and the
<PB N="225" REF="137"/> other was for the preservation of the Country. These two mervails were in the publick place, under two great triumphant Arches made of Marble, in one of which there was a fire, that without any Wood or Goals, or any other fewel did continually burn, yeilding so great a heat, that the poor Inhabitants who wanted fire at home, came commonly to this, so that many of the <HI>Rhodians</HI> spared making fire in their own houses, having the convenience of warming them selves at this publick fire, just opposite to this fire there was a great statur of brass, holding in his left hand a <HI>Turkish</HI> bowe, which he had so drawn with his right, that the very point of the arrow which was drawn to the head, and ready to discharge, touched the wood of the bowe whereon was written.</P>
<Q><L>Strike me not, for if you do,</L>
<L>I have more power t'offend than you.</L></Q>
<P>Under the other Arch there was a <HI>Columne</HI> which did shine very bright, and none knew of what ma∣terials it was composed, some supposed it to be of one unknown stone; others were of opinion that it was composed of divers mettals, but what ever it was made of, the brightness was so great that it sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned cleerly under all the Arch, thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Columne</HI> wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> suppor∣ted by four other stutues of brass, made in the figures of animals, the one was of an Eagle, the other of a Lion, the third of a Griffin, and the fouth of a Horse.

The

This did so encrease the affection of King <HI>Philarchus</HI> towards these Rascally Philoso∣phers, that he did nothing without their advice and counsell, and had them always in his Company commanding that they should be honoured as he himself was.</P>
<P>And now was be in great expectation to see the ef∣fects of the third Philosophers vision, which was to be at the third Moon, and on the other side the Philo∣sophers thought of nothing more but the means how they should performe their promise, which they had made to King <HI>Nichomachus;</HI> acording to which de∣sign they went one morning early to the King, to whom they with cheerful Countenances told that the Moon was disposed for the vision, so that the fol∣lowing night they should have the third Revelation
<PB N="239" REF="143"/> which would concern the most antient of the three <HI>Philarchus</HI> being very joyful at this news command∣ed that all things requisite for their Sacrifice, should be provided: And now using greater Ceremonies then ordinary, as the age of the person required, at their desire every one departed expecting what the Dreaming Philosopher would say the next morning; after the Sun was up the three Philosophers went to the Kings lodgings, the Dreamer being in the middle whither being come, he with smiling countenance said. Sir▪ g ve me your hand, for I bring you the best news you have had this long time; know then that in the Citty, not far from hence there is a Treasure three times as large as that which we have already found, and the Vessels that contain it are much more rich than the others: true it is that there will be some difficulty to come at it, for <HI>Pluto</HI> seeing the greatness of the Treasure, hath placed it very deep in the earth yet that shall be but li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tle hindrance, for since it is discovered it will be free.</P>
<P>The place <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here the Treasure it posited, it six hun∣dred paces from the Pallace, (you may take notice that these Rascalls had taken the pains privately to measure the distance which was between the <HI>Columne</HI> and the Pallace) di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ectly towards the South, which was the very place where the <HI>Columne</HI> stood. The King hearing this news was very well pleased, and pressed the Philosophers to make hast and find out the place; whereupon he went accompanied with diverse Princes and Lords▪ where being come the Dreaming Philosopher began to Calculate the distance of the place by the Astralobe and having marked by the Quadrant the exact place of the last pace, it happened
<PB N="240" REF="143"/> to be exact<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y in the midst of the Pedestal, and of the Base of the <HI>Columne,</HI> and having measured and calculated very exactly, he affi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>med that the treasure was placed directly under the <HI>Columne.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Philarchus</HI> seeing this began to be suspitious, so that he looked as white as a Clout, appearing to be more like a Ghost than a living man, but spake cleer∣ly, that he would not by no means suffer any digging under the <HI>Columne</HI> choosing rather to be without the gold &amp; lose all that he already had rather than hazard the miraculon <HI>Columne,</HI> wch might truly be said to be the <HI>Columne</HI> and prop to the Kingdome of <HI>Rhodes;</HI> to this the Antient Philosopher answered, that truly it would be great imprudence to hazard so rich and so excellent a treasure as the <HI>Columne</HI> was, which surpassed and exceeded all the treasures in the world; and that only to gain another lesser treasure which was hidden in the earth, but if so great a treasure might be attained as that which was hidden without damageing the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raculous <HI>Columne,</HI> that then it would be indiscretion to let it alone there. I dare un∣dertake said he, and so may others to keep this <HI>Co∣lumne</HI> with Timber which I will place round about it, which shall support it as formerly, that it shall be impossible to damage it, and these Engines shall be so strong, and so orderly placed, that you may dig under the foundation as much as you will, without the least prejudice in the world, and when the trea∣sure is taken from underneath it, a new and better foundation may be laid, then that which is there now, whereby the miraculous <HI>Columne</HI> may perpetually perform its office.</P>
<P>King <HI>Philarchus</HI> hearing this, began to consider, yet being still fearful of hazarding his rich <HI>Columne,</HI>
<PB N="241" REF="144"/> but withal very desirous to have the treasure which he certainly believed was underneath; wherefore he desired the Philosopher to make a case for the <HI>Co∣lumne,</HI> as soon as possibly he could, and to pro∣vide the other Engines to support it according to his best skill saying that as he found the Engines to be strong, he would consider whether he would have any digging under the <HI>Co∣lumne</HI> or not. The Philosopher who desired no more, being very glad that they had brought the King to this point, in very cheerful manner told him, so Sir be confident of this, that the Engin which we shal make, shall be so strong that they shall be not only capable of sustaining the miraculous <HI>Columne,</HI> but sufficient to support a Tower, so that all the digging that shall be used under it, shall not move it, but it shall remain as firm as if fixt on a sure foundation; and thereupon they made an Engine of wood to be as a case to the <HI>Columne,</HI> so that nothing could harm or touch it, this being done as the Pyoneers wrought, these Phi∣losophers were very curious that the <HI>Columne</HI> should suffer no prejudice by dust, and the better to preserve it, they covered that and the four Animals which served as supporters with cloathes, and they fil∣led all the void places between the Case and the <HI>Columne</HI> with Wool; but these Traitors pri∣vately mixed Pitch and Tarre, not permitting any to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve a hard in this p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etended preservation of the <HI>Columne,</HI> and that for fear that their treason should be discov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red; after this was done they desired the King and several Engineers to take a view of the Engines they had made to support the <HI>Columne;</HI> and this view being made, it was agreed on all hands that they might with safety dig under the <HI>Columne;</HI>
<PB N="242" REF="144"/> whereupon the King was well pleased and contented, and commanded that without any delay they should proceed to digging; then the Pyoneers began, but although they d gged all day, yet they found nothing, nay, they cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nued their work for part of the night, which the Philosopher seeing, he pretended to mea∣sure and c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lculate with his Astralobe, and having been dilligent in his calculation, he told the King that the treasure was yet as deep agen in the ground as they had digged; and therefore it would be convenient to deferre the digging untill the next morning, assuring him, that he should then see great matters.</P>
<P>Upon his promise the King retired, very desirous to see this great treasure discovered, certainly believe∣ing that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would be very great; considering that which had been already found out, and which in con∣clusion was too great for him, for instead of a trea∣sure which he thought to finde, he lost that wch was of more vaine than all the treasures in the World.</P>
<P>The Philosophers having made provision of all things necessary for the finishing their treason, and being assured of a Friggat, they went about mid∣night, when all the world were asleep, to the place where the <HI>Columne</HI> stood, and having anointed and bedaubed the case and wooden Engine, and all the Materials about the <HI>Columne</HI> with Oyl, Grease, and other ingredients fit to take fire, they put a barrel of Pitch, Sulpher and other Materials just underneath the <HI>Columne,</HI> and having set fire to it, on a suddain it made a terrible execution,</P>
<P>The Philosophers seeing this, and finding all things to be as they desired▪ and that the <HI>Columne</HI> could not possibly escape being destroyed, and knowing
<PB N="243" REF="145"/> they had no more to do at <HI>Rhodes,</HI> they embarqued themselves in their Friggat, where they had pri∣vately conveyed not only their Gold and Silver, but also several rich things which they had of the Kings; which they easily procured, as having liberty to take any thing they had a mind to without any contra∣diction, for so the King had commanded, and the Mariners plyed their Oars so lustily, that by the next morning they had lost the sight of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> in which there was a great uproar; for these Traitors had pla∣ced so much wood about the <HI>Columne,</HI> under pretence of securing it, that it caused so great a fire, that it not only consumed the <HI>Columne</HI> which was their prin∣cipal design; but also the Arch of Marble under which the <HI>Columne</HI> was placed, at the fall of which there was so great a noise as if the whole Pallace of King <HI>Philarchus</HI> had fallen into ruin; at the noise of which all the People did run to see what was the mat∣ter, and so did the King too: who now too late saw his Covetuousness, but however he commanded seve∣ral things to be done: to see if the <HI>Colum</HI> might be pre∣served, but all his endeavours were ineffectual, for not only the Arch but the <HI>Colum</HI> were both wholy ruined.</P>
<P>The people perceiving this, many of them ran with violence to the lodging of the Philosophers, and there they understood that they were gone, and had carried much of the Kings treasure with them; and then their suspition was cleered that all this ruin came by the only treason of the Philosophers; who being arrived at <HI>Cyprus</HI> were welcomed by King <HI>Nichoma∣chus,</HI> who gave them much treasure in recompence of their good service, whereby they had empoured him to be revenged on King <HI>Philarchus.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time the poor <HI>Rhodians</HI> were very
<PB N="244" REF="145"/> much troubled, that they were deprived of that which served for a defence, not only to the Citty of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> but to all the Island; and it was not long before their sorrow was increased, by means of King <HI>Ni∣chomachus,</HI> who having privatly raised great Forces, and obtained the alliance and friendship of divers Princes of <HI>Natolia,</HI> who were troubled at the pow∣er of the <HI>Rhodians</HI> their Neighbours; fell upon the Isle of <HI>Rhodes</HI> being unprovided, and so well prosecu∣ted their intentions, that they took the Citty, and King <HI>Philarchus</HI> had hardly the liberty to avoid the fury of the war, who from being a powerful Prince, was reduced to the necessity to turn Schoolmaster, &amp; teach publickly in the Isle of <HI>Metolin.</HI></P>
<P>And thus as the unextinguishable fire which was of so great commodity t the poor <HI>Rhodians,</HI> was put out by the sottishness of a Schollar, so the Citty of <HI>Rhodes</HI> was taken and pillaged by the cunning ma∣chinations of the Philosophers, and the King of that Island forced to confine himself as a banished man, into an Island, there to spend the remainder of his mise∣rable life.</P>
<P>To apply this History to the present occasion, I am fearful that the same calamnities may befall you, since the experience is already begun at <HI>Rome;</HI> where <HI>I</HI> may truly say these 2 marvails were. For I dare boast my self to have been that fire and burning lamp of honor, which the Ladies and Damsels of <HI>Rome</HI> owe unto their husbands, so that from me they m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght take example of their duty; but I may say this immortal fire of honor is extinct, not only by the sottishness, but by the disordinate appetite of a Schollar▪ who under pretence of being your Son, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your Capital Enemy: and although the integrity
<PB N="245" REF="146"/> of my faith did make him such resistance, that he did not obtain his will upon me, yet however the in∣famy still remains imprinted in the minds of all men, considering the great delayes which from day to day you make to avoid the execution of that just sentence which you have given against him. The consideration of which doth much trouble me, more out of respect to you than my self, but my heart is ready to burst to see the cunning contrivances that are used to ruin and destroy this most firm and strong <HI>Columne</HI> which has served as a safegua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d both to <HI>Rome</HI> and all the Empire; being so clee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that by its brightness it hath frustrated all the designs and enterprizes of those who design to raise arms against the Empire. This Sir is your prudence wherein formerly every one might see as in a looking glass, that which con∣cern'd the repose of all in general, so that being in its luster, and standing on its foundation, there is nothing that can prejudice the estate of the Empire; against which I see several treasons designed, not by three, but by seven, who have the title of Philosophers, ha∣ving abandoned themselves to all vices, only tending to the deliverance of <HI>Erastus,</HI> that he may take pos∣session of the Empire before his time; by means of their cursed and pernicious Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s▪ to deprive you of your Estate, that they may at their wills manage the affairs of the Empire; and because nothing can resist their designe, but the <HI>Columne</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our prudence they endeavour to undermine it by the various subtle wayes which they use to set all on fire as the other three did; and truly they are not far from accom∣plishing their ends; for they have already caused you to doubt of that truth which hath appeared before
<PB N="246" REF="146"/> your eyes: wherefore Sir while you have yet time open the eyes of your understanding, and do not permit the false and indirect inventions and machina∣tions of these Traytors, to bereave us with our ho∣nor (which already it much shaken) both of our E∣states and lives.</P>
<P>These complaints of the Empress were spoken with so much earnestness, that the Emperour con∣ceited that all the good advertisements which tho Philosophers gave him, were to no other purpose but to deceive him, so that he presently commanded that they should be committed to prison, promising the Empress that the next day should not pass, but she should see her self revenged both of <HI>Erastus</HI> and the Philosophers, and that he did not doubt but that the Philosophers were Traitors as she had wisely disco∣vered. The Empress being very well contented ap∣peared more pleasant than usual, and lay that night with the Emperour, only waiting for the hour, wherein her wicked and perverse desires should be ac∣complished by the death of her Son in law, &amp; the in∣nocent Philosophers.</P>

<P>But above all the Philosopher <HI>Lencus,</HI> whose turn it was to defend the Prince <HI>Erastus</HI> the seventh day, he was much troubled, for he had prepared so pa∣theticall an Oration, that although the Emperour should be never so obstinate, yet he assured himself by his Oration to move the Senate and People to take the young Prince out of Prison and secure him for some time, till the Emperours anger should be over. But now he being secured in a Prison where his Ora∣tion would be to little purpose he was so dejected that he was alm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st out of his wits; yet however he did intend to do his utmost for his young Master, and in regard he had not the conveniency of speaking, he resolved to write to the Emperour, and having Pen, Ink and Paper, he thus began.</P>
<PB N="249" REF="149"/>
<Q><P>TO the Emperour <HI>Dioclesian,</HI> one of his faithful Counsellors sendeth greeting. The duty which oblieges all men to serve each other, and the truth of which I have always made profession, together with the fidelity which I owe to my soveraign Lord and Prince, hath constrained me Sir, to declare to you by Writing, that which with a good will I should have spoken by word of mouth: The matter being of such importance, that your honour and reputation and quiet of the Empire de∣pendeth thereon; you being established in the Govern∣ment thereof, ought not only to give audience to those who demand it, but it is also convenient for you to change your mind, when it contradicted by reason; for that man who hath the mannagement of publique affairs, ought not to be stiffe in his opinion but to alter his mind as often, as to the publique good it shall appear to be necessary; and if he ought to be thus observant in af∣fairs of small importance, how much more is an Em∣perour engaged in great affairs, nay in those wherein consist the safety or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uin of the Empire; and I question not but you will do so, provided you will lay aside your passion which every M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gistrate ought to do; and have patience to read what <HI>I</HI> now write unto you, not for my particular interest but out of respect to your self who are my Soveraign Prince, and for the consequen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> which may happen to the Empire, the repose and good whereof entirely depends upon that which is now in question; for as justice causeth Common wealth and Empires to encrease, so on the contrary where iniquity and inordinate affections reign &amp; wher justice is wan∣ting, all things go from bad to worse. And of this we every day see a world of experiences which are manifest enough to us all; and we are sure that there is no Mo∣narchy
<PB N="250" REF="149"/> nor Empire so firmly fixed, but injustice in short time destroys it which entring the brest of a great E∣state produceth most dangerous fruits and ffects: Now no person is more remarkable than an Emperour; and if histories which have made so great mater of the severity of <HI>Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tus</HI> &amp; <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orquatu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> who are so m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>morable for their cruelty although when they put their Children to death it was for violating the Laws. With what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nfamy then will the Emperour <HI>Dioclesian</HI> be noted for putting to death his only Son without hearing any thing in his de∣fence, which is a thing contrary to all Laws and ordi∣nances, humane anal divine; for there is no Nation so Barbarous, to execute a Criminall without giving him a competent time to Justifie himself.</P>
<P>Is it then possible that the Emperour <HI>Dioclesian</HI> who hath always been esteemed a just Prince, and an obser∣ver of right shall now introduce a custom so inhumane and cruel as this. If the authority of the Senate doth not at all move you, or if you doubt that Prince <HI>Erastus</HI> shall escape while you proceed orderly, are not your Pri∣sons strong enough, and well guarded with Soldiers, is there any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enato<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Prince or Barron, to whom you have been pleased <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k of this affair, who hath not endea∣vored to divert you from t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is hasly execution, and none hastens you therein but the venemous rage of a woman by whose counsel a <HI>Roman</HI> Emperono can get nothing but blame, let the Counsel be never so good; and there∣fore what infancy will you procure to your self to use contrary to all reason so great cruelty at the only per∣swasions of a woman. Know Sir, that women are made to serve men, and not to counsel them and he who is ab∣lutely governed by their counsel shall in the end to bis damage repent thereof; for although a woman is desire∣ous
<PB N="251" REF="150"/> to give good counsel, yet the imbecillity of the sex causes their counsel alwayes to happen to the worst as not long since it happened to a Physitian; which story be pleased to read.</P></Q>
<P>It is not long since that at <HI>Millain</HI> there was a Physitian named <HI>Polictetus</HI> in very great esteem of all, as well by reason of his wealth, as for the opini∣on which every one had of his knowledge; so that he was esteemed the principal and most famous Phy∣sitian of <HI>Millain,</HI> and indeed he deserved this title, having performed many almost incredible Cures.</P>
<P>This Physitian had for wife a Damsel of <HI>Millain</HI> named <HI>Flaminia</HI> who was one of the principal fami∣lies of that City, by whom he had one only Son, and no other Children. But although nature had been niggardly in giving him but one, yet in recompence she was very liberal, having formed this Child so fair and of so gentle a spirit that it was pleasant to behold him, for being but seaven years of age, he gave hopes not onely to his Father and Mother, but also to all that beh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld him, that in time he would be a great personage and of reputation; for which cruse his Father l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved him more then his own life and caused him to beinstructed and exercised in all exercises, as well of the body as the mind, proper and convenient for that age; finding him very well disposed to Sci∣ences, well formed in his body, strong in his mem∣bers as having never been sick.</P>
<P>It happened when he was nine years old, he fell in∣to a distemper which in the beginning seemed to be small; which his father seeing would take the advice
<PB N="252" REF="150"/> of other Physitians, although he himself was esteemed the first; for fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r his affection in his own case should deceive him. Having therefore brought two of the most experienced Physitians of <HI>Millain</HI> to his house he recomended his Son to them; however he himself took notice of what they ordered. This disease of the Child which at the first was small and slight, did daily increase so that instead of diminishing, by means of the remedies, which were given yet he every day grew worse and worse, and thus it continued for a moneths time; all which time the Physitians did all that was possible according to Art, for the health of the Child, without perceiving any amendment but or the contrary he was the worse for every thing they give him: The poor father was almost desperate and so were the Physitians, who now resolved to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve him no more Medecines, but only to comfort and fortify nature by restoratives, that he might live as long as he could, being out of hopes of restoring him to his former health; the Child finding himself as sick as his heart could hold, desired them to give him a white Onion to eat; to this the Physitians would not con∣sent, in regard an Onion is contrary to a feavour, and yet all the while the disease encreased so much the more did the Child cry out for an Onion, say∣ing if they would not give him a white Onion he should dye.</P>
<P>The Physitians seeing there was no other reme∣dy for him agreed that he should have an Onion, more to content him then any thing else, say∣ing that, that could not do him much prejudice considering the violence of his distemper; and having sent for a white Onion to give him, the Childs Mother
<PB N="252" REF="151"/> another came into the the Chamber, who seeing them a∣bout to give him an Onion, fell into the greatest pas∣sion in the world; saying that this was to kill her Child, and that she could not endure it to be a Mur∣dress of her own blood, and she made such a noise to her husband, and the other Phisicians, that the Onion was not given to the Child, whereupon the Child took it so to heart, that he did not languish long be∣fore he dyed, still even to death crying out after his Onion.</P>
<P>The Father and Mother were as much grieved a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> can be imagined, having no other Child but his wherein was all their comfort, and being out of hopes of having any more, af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er the death of the Child, the Phsitians were desirous to op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the body, at this the Father was was well contented, being desirous to know the cause of that distemper, which no Phisick had p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wer to cure, he being then opened, there was found on the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tom of his stomach, neer to his heart, a peice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ice hard as Christal, at which they were all astonished, to see water thus congealed in a humain body, and they all agreed that there was no c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>g of him, but by things proper to desolve the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ol; and that the Child dyed for want of such Remedies, the poor Father who alwayes had his Son before his eyes, in respect of the great love he had for him, that he might have some mark and token caused this Christal to be enchased in the haft of a knife, which he usually carryed about him upon all occasions, and when he drew it, he alwayes kissed the Christal in memory of his Son; and thus it passed for a whole year, but on that very day twelve moneth that his son dyed (whether by chance or that Na∣ture
<PB N="253" REF="151"/> was willing to shew the greatness of its secrets) this Phisitian being at the Table, had a mind to eat a white Onion, one being brought him hercut it in to peices with his knife, and having tasted a slice or too, he asked for drink, and let his knife fall on part of the Onion that was on the Table, but he had no sooner drank, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> going to take his knife, he found it without a haft, for the Christal that wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fixed thereon was dissolved, and diligently searching the cause, he knew that the vertue of the Onion had de∣solved the Christal into water; wherefore being a wise man, he conjectured that his Son by a secret in∣stinct of Nature, was so importunate before he dyed to have a white Onion, as being the sole remedy, and only expedient for his disease, so that understanding that he had caused the death of his only Son, by de∣nying him an Onion, only at the perswasions of a woman, contrary to the directions of him, and the other Phisitians, he took his knife in one hand, and the peice of the Onion in the other, saying with sighs and tears, Ah poor and unfortunate Father, you now see the great evil, which you have caused; this day it is just twelve moneths, that by my own fault I lost my only Son, and that <HI>I</HI> might know my misfortune, the Heavens have this day made me see it; who will not blame my sottishness, knowing that I have caused the death of my only Son, by following the di∣rections of a foolish and distracted woman. Now <HI>I</HI> know it but too late, that Nature shewed her self as bountiful in preserving my Son, as she was liberal in bestowing him upon me; behold the sign, behold the Christal dissolved, by vertue of the white Onion which my poor Child so often desired to have, but
<PB N="255" REF="152"/> in vain, whereat Nature being angry, hath made me understand and know to take such vengeance of me as I deserve; and to serve for a perpetual example to all men, not to give credit to this sotteri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s &amp; malig∣nities of their wives; my Son being dead, who other∣wise by the course of Nature might have lived long, shall I live? <HI>I</HI> who have caused his death? It shall not be so, I cannot endure my self, such a mischief shall not go unpunished, and on a sud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in when he had spo∣ken thus, he thrust the kni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e which he held into his wives b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen did as much to himself; and that with such quickness, that those who were pre∣sent, and who melted in tears, thus to hear the poor Father complain, did not mind him, and much less had the means to hinder what he did.</P>
<P>This was the end of poor <HI>Polectetus,</HI> who to his great prejud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce found the danger of being governed by the counsel of a woman; for if the counsel of a woman be bad, when sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thinks to do well, as it was with the poor <HI>Flaminia,</HI> what is it then when she is moved with rage and fury.</P>
<P>The means which the Empress uses up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n this ac∣count I sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll let pass, because Sir your Maj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sty is best acquainted therewith: but I dare say and affirm, that if you suffer your self to be over ruled by her, and cause your Son to dye, without well considering of the matter, I doubt nor but it will happen to you, as it did to <HI>Polictetus,</HI> and it may be worse; and yet <HI>I</HI> do not conclude that Prince <HI>Erastus</HI> ought not to suffer death, if what he is accused of be found to be true, and that the Philosophers escape death who instead of instructing him in vertuous courses and good learning; have rendred him so unnatural,
<PB N="256" REF="152"/> and given to sensuallity. Yet however I once again urge, that in this point you do not depend upon the sole words of a woman, nor to those who on this oc∣casion are transported with passion, as you your self are, for the wrong you think you have received; which if it should be true there should be no torment nor pain how great soever, which should not be thought li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in comparison to such an excess; But all those who know and are acquainted with the ver∣tues, and gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t continence of young Prince <HI>Erastus,</HI> are of another mind. And therefore not only to con∣tent your mind, as belongs to so great a Prince as you are; I pray, Exhort, and Counsel you to leave this affair to the Senate. And in case Prince <HI>Erastus</HI> be found guilty of the fact, that he dye miserably by the hand of justice, and with him the seven Philosophers, who have instructed him so wickedly; and on the contrary if he be found Innocent, that his Innocence he not oppressed. And do not think Sir, that <HI>I</HI> say this to prolong this cause, and by this means escape death, for I onely desire three days time for the Philoso∣phers; in which time if they do not cleerly make ap∣pear the Innocence of your Son, and if he himself do not Justifie himself wi hin that time, that he be put to death, and with him the seven Philosophers, begin∣ning with me <HI>Lencus,</HI> who have writ this present Letter; not having at the beginning put the name of him who sent it, lest (considering the great hatred you bear to us) you should refuse to read it, seeing it directed by one of us; &amp; therefore wonder not Sir, at what I send you word, that your son shall Justifie himself; for the cause of his not speaking hitherto comes not by any natural default which he hath, nei∣ther

</ARGUMENT>
<P>A Gentleman of <HI>Rome</HI> who was blessed with a large estate, had for his sole heir, or Daughter of an incomparable beauty and Ingenious Soul, and having been carefull to give her vertuous education, she by that Addition had so honourable a fame, that all the young men of quality in those parts became her Suitors; but it being impossible for her to be the lawful prize for them all, she at length was so importunatly courted by one, that she was espoused to him. He who was thus happy in her love &amp; enjoment was a Gentleman, in whom nothing was wanting that could be req<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ired to make him accomplisht and ami∣able, especially in her eye, who loved him with equal
<PB N="259" REF="153"/> ardours, and thought of no felicity, but in his mutual affections and Society, so that all men (his envous. Rivals only excepted) expected from so fare an Uni¦on, would proceed all mortal happiness in perfection. But observe the unconstancy of humane felicity, these two Lovers had not long enjoyed each other when fate (seldome long favourable to Lovers) steps in and divides them, by the Eternal divorce of death; translating the husband into an other life, and leaving the Widdow almost liveless, for so had her grief made her, and nothing kept her from using violence on her self, that she might enjoy him in the <HI>Elizium</HI> shader but the desire of seeing him laid into his Tomb, with such Funerall Pomp and solemne obsequies, as were agreeable both to her sorrow and his quality; and that affair being once over, she resolved that it should not be long ere her Spirit were remitted to his, to re∣gain that content in the other World, which had been ravisht from her in this; and to perfect this resolution she made a rigorous vow that she would receive no nu∣rishment to continue her in this world, but by her ab∣stinence hasten her to the other; &amp; thus she continued for some days &amp; nights, notwithstanding the impor∣tunities of her relations, and the necessities of nature urged her to comiserate &amp; relieve her self: And as if this had not been sufficient to exalt her sorrowes, she goe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> privately into the Vault where her husbands bo∣dy remained, &amp; siting down on the damp earth, fixt her eyes upon his Coffin as the proper object of her dis∣tracted fancy. At the same time that this her hus∣bands Corps was deposited in a Tomb in the earth a notorious Malefactor was condemned to the Gibbet and his body to remain hanging in the aire that it might serve for terrour &amp; example to all othe crimi∣nals

<P>I have already told you, that some others say this was the story or example which <HI>Lencus</HI> the Philoso∣pher did write in a Letter, and send to the Empe∣rour, but some agen say that it was the former of the Physitian of <HI>Millain,</HI> they are both to one pur∣pose and efect, to shew the weakness, instabillity and passions of women, and may be, and are well applyed to the Emperour in this occasion about his Son <HI>Erastus;</HI> for the satisfaction of the Reader, &amp; that nothing may be wanting to make this book as com∣pleat as possibly as I can, I have given the Reader an account of them both, he may give credit to which he pleaseth, and therefore I shall thus proceed.</P>
<P>After the Philosopher <HI>Lencus</HI> had sealed and sub∣scribed this Letter, he delivered it to one of the Sol∣diers that was set to gard him, charging him above all things to deliver it that morning early to the Em∣perour, and to tell him that it was an advertisement of very great importance. This the Soldier promi∣sed faithfully to do, and thereupon he went directly to the Castle to execute his charge; the Emperour seeing the day break and that the Sun did already gild the tops of the mountains, that he might be di∣stant from a spectacle so miserable, as that of the death of his Son, and of seven Persons esteemed and reputed to be the wisest of that Age, he therefore
<PB N="274" REF="162"/> purposed to ride out into the fields, to divert his me∣lancholly as well as he could, and as he was about to mount on horseback the Soldier which the Philoso∣pher had sent, making his reverence, delivered the Letter to him. He instantly opening it read it, but not without great alteration, which was taken notice of by those that were about him, seeing that he often changed colour, from thence beleiving that it was something concerning the Prince <HI>Erastus.</HI> The Em∣perour having then read this Letter, remained for some time very pensive, without speaking one word, yet withal concluding that he could do no less than to communicate this advertisement to the counsel, he returned in some p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion to the Castle. The Senate being assembled he declared that as he could do no less than punish by the way of justice the detestable fellony which his own Son had c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmitted against him; and the treason of those who having the charge to instruct him as well in good manners as in learn∣ing; instead of rend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing him eloquent, and of good speech, they had brought him dumb and distracted; and instead of instruct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng him in good manners, they had instructed him in the wickedness that was in question, and yet these Philosophers had presumed to justifie him in an act so wicked and so apparent; however he would not proceed of himself, but had caused this counsel to be assembled, to make them ac∣quainted with the sentence which he had given on this occasion, so that he did believe there was no reason to revoke it; nor no occasion for further proof, the matter of fact being so cleer and manifest unto all; yet nevertheless to let all the world know, that he would not, nor did not intend to stop the
<PB N="275" REF="163"/> mouths of any Criminals from justifying themselves (al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hough in this case he could not see any way of justification) he was content to wash his hands of this business, &amp; to remit the whole cause to the considera∣tion of the Senate, with this <HI>proviso,</HI> nevertheless that <HI>Erastus</HI> and the Philosophers should only have two dayes time to say and alledge before the Senate, all that they could think off, or speak for their justi∣fication and defence; and that if in the same two dayes it did not appear to the Senate by evident proofs, and manifest arguments that <HI>Erastus</HI> was innocent of that whereof he was accused to have acted against his honour, that then without delay He and his Masters should be all publickly executed by the hand of justice the morning of the third day follow∣ing; and having finished his discourse, he command∣ed that his Son &amp; the Philosophers should be brought before the Senate fettered, and with a strong guard. Prince <HI>Erastus</HI> hearing the door of his Dungeon opened, supposed they came to fetch him to executi∣on: but when he perceived that they led him before the Senate he took heart, and more especially when he saw his Masters there, in whose wisdome he had so much assurance that he hoped to escape that day which being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce pass d, he feared nothing.</P>
<P>Now it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as that he was in most care and fear to to keep silence, aswel in consideration of the many questions that were asked him, as also in regard of the op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nion that had poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssed many of the Senators that he w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lty of the fact wherewith he was charged; not using any manner of justification in a matter that concerned his life; and therefore the most part of the Senators, seeing him thus dumbe
<PB N="276" REF="163"/> held him guilty of the fact, but on the other side, the Philosophers did so readily defend the cause of <HI>E∣rastus</HI> and their own, and alledged so many examples to the Senate, that they were divided in their Opi∣nions, and all that day was spent without taking any resolution to the great satisfaction and content of Prince <HI>Erastus;</HI> and by order of the Senate the Pri∣soners were sent back to Prison, and kept assunder with express intimation, that if on the next day they made not better proof of their innocence than hitherto they had done, they should proceed against them in real execution of that sentence which the Emperour had pronounced against them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP.

<P>Whereupon having considered the manner how he discovered his intent to his favourites, telling them that since his Son would not consent to be married, than he himself should be constrained to take a wife, whereby so noble a family as his might not be lost; having none to bear his Name and Arms but the young <HI>Philemon,</HI> and this he gave out, not out of a∣ny thoughts of being married, but to invite <HI>Phile∣mon</HI> to take a wife; certainly believing that when <HI>Philemon</HI> should hear this news, if nothing else should move him to be married; yet at last the fear of being deprived of so great a succession, as that of <HI>Archelaus</HI> by the Children which he might have of a wife, if he should take one, would induce him to consent to the will of his Father. But all this did not divert <HI>Phile∣mon</HI> from his oppinion knowing on the one side that <HI>Archelaus</HI> was already out of hopes of having Chil∣dren, and on the other side, if he should have any he could not live to see them great by the course of na∣ture, so that by necessity he should always have the government of those Children, and of the Lands and Lordships of <HI>Archelaus,</HI> remaining by this means as absolute Lord of the said Lands, as if <HI>Archelaus</HI> had no Children. In conclusion <HI>Archelaus</HI> seeing that young <HI>Philemon</HI> regarded not the same that was spread abroad, thought that by the greatness and vi∣vacity of his spirit he had disovered his intention; and therefore to make the matter seem more probable and real he began to seek out for a marriage for himself, enquiring among all the Damsels that were marriage∣able,
<PB N="287" REF="170"/> to find one prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r and convenient for him, not that he intended to be ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r ed, but to induce <HI>Philemon</HI> thereunto, seeing tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there was no diss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbling in the Case, and that he might think his father would in good esrnest marry, as it was the general discourse of all people. But for all this <HI>Philemon</HI> still continued absolute ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nst marriage, so that what was first in∣tended for jest proved in earnest, for a Damsel was found out for <HI>Archelaus</HI> her name was <HI>Eufrosena</HI> she was fair vertuous, of a C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> age, and of as good a family as he desired.</P>
<P><HI>Archelaus</HI> seeing this, and that this Damsel came freely to him, and that <HI>Philemon</HI> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld not marry; he therfore purposed to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ceed in this marriage. This was approved of by all, and o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Philemon</HI> himself without whose advice he would not conclude thereon And so this Wedding was solemnized, with all fit magnificence to the great content of every one.</P>
<P><HI>Archelaus</HI> being very well pleased with his marri∣age, having d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly experience of the mild Spirit, great prudence and vertue of his wife, began to introduce her into the Rule and Government of all his Lands and houses; y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut taking the mannagement of his affairs from <HI>Philemon,</HI> but with this charge that in all eases of importance, and which required coun∣sel, he should act nothing without Communicating thereof to his Mother-in-law. This woman behaved her self so vertuously in her mannagement, that in short time by degrees all affairs passed through her hands; for on the one side <HI>Archelaus</HI> being striken in years, would not trouble himself with business having more need of rest, and on the other side <HI>Philemon</HI> minded nothing but his pastime, and to enjoy all the
<PB N="288" REF="170"/> pleasure that came into his fantasie sometimes to the prejudice of others, remitting all dispatches to his Mother in Law, who did expedite all the most dextruously that might be, and with great equity. The subjects seeing their Lady behave her self so virtuously in the Government of the Country, took heart to complain to her of the great disorders and violence which <HI>Philemon</HI> committed; so that from all parts complaints came to her ears; yet she being mild and good natured endeavoured at first to ex∣case and cover the faults of <HI>Philemon;</HI> and then in private to c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>de him, admon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shing, exhorting and praying him so to de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an himself, that he should use no violence towards the Subjects, and to mind his business as formerly he had done, shewing himself worthy of that quality whereto he had been called by the bounty of Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tune; and by the love which <HI>Archelaus</HI> had born him, hereupon young <HI>Philemon</HI> very humbly thanked her, with a pro∣mise from thence forwards to follow the good ad∣vertisements, which by her b u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty she had given him; yet nevertheless he acted quite contrary, not omitting to do any thing that his wicked inclina∣tions led him to, and al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hough he endeavoured to act his lew'd tricks at privately as he could, that his Mother in law might not discover him; yet now it was not so as it had formerly been with his Fa∣ther, for he was acquainted with all his actions, because the Subjects went more freely to make their complaints to <HI>Eufrosena,</HI> than to <HI>Archelaus,</HI> seeing the ready and quick dispatches which she gave to all affairs; and now they did not fear that she should be transported with natural affecti∣on

Young <HI>Philemon</HI> counterfeiting a Re∣pentance, and that he was very sorrowful, that he had committed crimes to the displeasure of his Father, begged his pardon promising to live so strictly from thence forward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that he should never hear any just complaint against him.</P>
<P>Yet it was not long after this that he had a mind to a fair young Damsel, daughter to a Gentleman of the most considerable quality of his fathers Subjects▪ and not knowing how by fair means to get poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion of her, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e one day made a forceible entry into the house of this Gentlem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, and carryed away the Dam∣sel. This rude action coming to the knowledge of <HI>Archelaus,</HI> he Commanded that <HI>Philemon</HI> should be suddenly seiz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d on, and being strictly guarded should be carried Prisoner to a strong Castle, giving express commands to the Captain of the Castle, that upon pain of his high displeasure, he should put <HI>Philemon</HI> in the stronge; Prison of the Castle, that he might at all times render a good account of him.</P>
<P><HI>Philemon</HI> being thus put into Prison, conceived mortal hatred against his Mother-in-law, believing all the anger of <HI>Archelaus</HI> did proceed from her, and by her Instigation; and from thencef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rth purposed to imploy all his power and wicked Spirit, to ruine the good and innocent Lady: And that he might accom∣plish his design, he endeavoured all that in him lay to get the friendship of the Captain of the Castle which he easily performed; the Capt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in being a good fellow, one who desired to please all and par∣ticularly <HI>Philemon,</HI> whom he one day hoped to see Lord of all the Lands of <HI>Archelaus.</HI> And therefore he often visited <HI>Philemon</HI> eating and
<PB N="291" REF="172"/> drinking with him, endeavouring to divert him by Playing, singing, and other recreation; so that his liberty only excepted, he knew nothing that would please <HI>Philemon,</HI> but he suffered him to enjoy it.

He seeing his keeper to be so much his friend, that he might without any danger discover any secret to him; he one day took him apart, and having made a long preamble of the many traverses which his Mother-in-law had practised to his prejudice, and that with∣out cause, so that she had by these means brought him t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Prison him who was by right the true and Lawful Lord of the Countrey; there to cause him to Languish in a condition worse than death, had it not been for his kin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ness to him, for which he reckoned himself v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry much oblig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, so that he should never forget it, and being willing to begin to acknow∣ledge the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iendship and service which he had received of him, and gave him assurance of what he m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght hereafter expect; when by the death of his Father he should be Master of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; he therefore purposed to take his only daugh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to wife, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on this condition that the said C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ptain would Aid and assist him in what he purposed to do And then he began to discourse of the probable coo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> he would take to be revenged on h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Innocen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ufrosena,</HI> and told him particularly how the design should be man∣naged.</P>
<P>The affection which the Captain had to see his daughter so highly preferred and the Ambition to

<P><HI>Archelaus</HI> hearing this newes of his wife, was du∣ring the Captains discourse in great torment, con∣sidering the great experience he had of his wives vertue; he could not im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gine that she would have thought, and much less have endeavoured so treaso∣nable an action, yet understanding tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by the letter, he migh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> know the truth, he p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmitt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the Captain to finish his discourse, which being ended he took the letter, and having well v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ewed and considered it, he did certainly bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive it to be her own hand writeing.</P>

<P>Sir, I doubt that this Letter is not the true hand of my Lady, it is, it is sighing said the poor <HI>Archelaus,</HI> I know it too well suppose it to be so said the Cap∣tain, it was only to make tryal of my fidelity, for I cannot imagine for what reason she should attempt to murther one to whom she hath without the least distaste alwayes shewed all manner of dutiful love; but I have discovered something else, which cleers the truth of all, for she hath sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rned with mony some my Soldiers, and took an oath of them that they would kill me at her arrival here, which should be soon after your death, that she might be rid of us both; and these very Soldiers have discovered this conspiracy, after I had assured them of pardon, and this they themselves will relate to you.</P>
<P>Having said thus, he caused the seven Complices to come into the Chamber, who when they c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me thither fell down on their knees befo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <HI>Archelaus,</HI> begging pardon for the great fault which they had committed in harkning to so great a Treason as that wherein they had b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> engaged, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd for which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey had received reward; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>on how <HI>Eufrosena</HI> had hy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p∣tain, as the Captain had told <HI>Archelaus,</HI> but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fter
<PB N="297" REF="175"/> that being sensible of the greatness of the crime which they had undertaken; they resolved of two evils to choose the least, and submit to their Captain who had been graciously pleased to pardon them.</P>
<P><HI>Archelaus</HI> comparing this relation with the con∣tents of the Letter, no longer doubted but that the case was just as the trayterous Captain had told him, yet he knew not what to resolve upon, for on the one h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the great treason which he believed his wife to be guilty of, drove him on to revenge; and on the other hand the love he bore to the innocent Lady, staid and hindred him. The trayterous Captain per∣ceiving this, said Sir, when a man is interested in any case, and passionate his best course is to take advise of others, and therefore I will give you my best counsel, which if you please you may follow, other∣wise you may d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cline it, and take your own course.</P>
<P>If it were my case, I would have you send for your wife; pretending to conferre with her about s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me case of importance, and so soon as she comes h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, cause her head to be cut off, as a reward for her treason, which <HI>I</HI> think is plain enough proved un∣to you; <HI>Archelau,</HI> approving of the counsel of this tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yterous and cursed Captain, sent to his wife that without any delay, she should come to the Castle to acquaint her with some weighty matters; the good and virtuous Lady having received her husbands l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, suddainly mounted on horse-back and came thither; but she was no sooner passed the two first gates of the Castle, when she was se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zed on by the seven Soldiers, who cut of her head, not p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmitting her to speak one w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> d; <HI>Archelaus</HI> would not be present at this miserable execution, but remitted all
<PB N="298" REF="175"/> to the Captains discretion, who having performed what he had intended, and resolving to adde one treason to another returned to <HI>Archelaus,</HI> to whom he said that <HI>Eufrosena</HI> se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing her life to be at the latest account, and that her treasons were discovered, for which she had deserved death: she therefore charged him to tell her Husband that she prayed him to pardon those crimes she would have committed, therefore confessing her self worthy of a more cru∣el death than she was to suffer; also acknowledging that she knew not wherefore such a Treason had en∣tred into her mind, but that God by his just judge∣ment had bereaved her of her sense and understand∣ing, for the great wrong; which she had done to the innocent <HI>Philemon,</HI> having so calumniated and accu∣sed him, having hyred a Gentleman who complained against him, pretending that he had forced his daugh∣ter, which was a thing counterfeited, that she might remove her Son in Law from the management of affairs, and be her self the sole Governness.</P>
<P>This the poor old man easily believed, so that he caused the traiterous <HI>Philemon</HI> to be immediately taken out of Prison, making excuses to him, for the hard usage which he had receaved, and he instantly out him into the same capacity he had bin in: giving him greater authority than before; so that all dis∣patches depended absolutely upon him and passed through his hands.</P>
<P><HI>Philemon</HI> then seeing himself in the condition he de∣sired, for some time managed the affairs with such dexterity that he in short time obtained the good will of the People; yet considering that <HI>Archelaus</HI> was not so old but that he might be married again, and
<PB N="299" REF="176"/> that then there would be an alteration in his condi∣tion, he purposed to assure himself and be peaceable; Lord of all the Lands of <HI>Archelaus,</HI> whilest it was in his power, and not to delay his design, lest some new trouble should arise; wherefore being experi∣enced in the dexterity of his Father in law, in wick∣ed actions he declared his intention to him, desireing his assistance. This Traytor had often thought of this matter as well as <HI>Philemon,</HI> and was so ambitious of seeing himself great, that every day seemed a year to him▪ till his Son in law should be absolute Lord and Master of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Lands; and therefore he told <HI>Philemon</HI> that he should leave the management of that affair to him, for at <HI>Archelaus</HI> his next coming to the Castle, such order should be taken, that for the future he should not be hindred of being abso∣lute Lord; and having conferred his intention with those Soldiers that had murthered <HI>Eufrosena,</HI> that the next day he should leave the Castle, and go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dayes journey from thence to mannage his aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irs, that his abse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce should not cause him to be in the least suspected, and that he should be r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ady to re∣turn thither as to the chief place of residence, and to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ize on all his other houses before any trouble should happen.</P>
<P><HI>Philemon</HI> takeing his Father in laws advice, de∣parted f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om the Castle, and not long after <HI>Ar∣chelaus</HI> came thither, who one day walking with the Captain in a private place of the Castle, two of those murderours Soldiers threw a girdle about his neck, and there immediately strangled him.</P>
<PB N="300" REF="176"/>
<P>The poor <HI>Archelaus</HI> being dead, the rascal Captain made an out-cry, so that all the Soldi∣ers did run to see what was the matter▪ and he holding the dead body in his arms, with feigned tears told them, that while he was talking a <HI>Ga∣tarhe</HI> had seised on him, so that he f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll down dead in the place: and then he caused him to be laid in his bed, applying perfumes and other re∣medies to see if he would come to himself, but all was to no purpose, which he seeing without any delay sent in Post to <HI>Philemon,</HI> and after he had counterfeited lamentations for the death of his Lord, he caused him to be interred in the most sumptuous manner that he could.</P>
<P><HI>Philemon</HI> understanding of the death of <HI>Ar∣chelaus</HI> was very well pleased, but in appearance shewed much discontent and sorrow, but soon re∣turned to the Castle, where with tears he was received of the Captain, and all others of the Town for their lawful Lord; and having taken order for mourning, he took poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion of the Lordships thus wickedly usurped before the time, beginning at the cheif City, and from thence go∣ing from place to place without any contradicti∣on.</P>
<P>The time of mourning being over, <HI>Philemon</HI> was solemnly married to the Captains daughter, and he gave large rewards to the Soldiers who had served him in his designs, but in conclusion he caused them all to be privately murthered.</P>
<P>He himself did not long enjoy his estate, for the justice of Heaven which leaves no evil
<PB N="301" REF="177"/> action unpunished, raised an English Lord against him to be his Enemy; who having intelligence with cer∣tain o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er French Lords, who although they were <HI>Philemons</HI> Neighbours, yet they hated him for his tyranny) necessitated him to retire to an inconsider∣able Cittie, where being taken by the <HI>English,</HI> he was burnt alive, and as they led him to execution, he confessed that he had deserved not only to be burnt, but a far w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rse punishment, not for the wrong which he had done to the <HI>English,</HI> but for the great treason which he had committed against <HI>Archelaus,</HI> and the innocent <HI>Eufrosena;</HI> declaring particularly how all things had been contrived and executed, and then being fastned to the stake, he there finished his wicked life,</P>
<P>This history my Lord, said the Empress, I had a minde to relate to you, to see if it might be possi∣ble to open your eyes that you may see that this your Son endeavors nothing else, with his seven trayterous Complices (and not Philosophers) to dispatch me out of this world, being assured that if I were removed: I who am your loyal wife and com∣panion, they would more easily attain their ends; which is to make themselves peaceable Lords of the Empire, without waiting for the nat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ral course of your life, ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inst which they have had many designs, and it would not be long ere they were effected, if <HI>I</HI> were once taken away from you, and this all persons of j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dgment may easily perceive; and although Heaven in the end will not leave this unpunished, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et we must first suffer a miserable death, if ac∣cording to your duty, you do not make timely provision against it, and my Parents and Relations

<P>These speeches of the Empress were uttered with so much livelyness and earnestness, that not only the Emperor, but her Relations resolved that <HI>Erastus</HI> should dye without delay, so that if it had been day time, as indeed it was not, part of the night being passed away and spent, the Emperour would have caused the innocent <HI>Erastus,</HI> and the seven Philoso∣phers to be dispatched; and therefore he gave abso∣lute command, that without attending any other or∣der of the Senate, the next morning without any delay, Prince <HI>Erastus</HI> should be publickly executed by the common Executioner, and after him the seven Phi∣losophers; after he had given this order, he endeavo∣red to appease the Empress, and for her better sa∣tisfaction he committed the execution of the sentence to four Persons, who were her particular favorites; causing his father in Law, and other Lords who were the Relations of the Empress to stay and sup with him, and he that night lay with the wicked and per∣verse <HI>Aphrodicia.</HI></P>

<PB N="304" REF="178"/> Pidgeon to be so fair, he took great pleasure in it, and by all means <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndeavoured to have its company. The Pidgeon at fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> was well enough contented, and not only shewed love to, but also respected the Ser∣pent; but seeing that the Serpent kissed it, and en∣deavoured by all means to couple with it, the Pid∣geon with h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ror and anger which it had against this villanous and venemous beast began to flye; the Ser∣pent on the other side seeing it self disdained, seemed to have changed into mortal hatred, all the love which he had to this Pidgeon, endeavouring by all means to kill the poor Bird, in such manner pur∣suing it, that the Emperour himself hated it▪ out of respect to the great Serpent, so that he also assisted to kill it, and yet he thought that the poor Pidgeon made no defence, only looked to heaven, without speak∣ing, as if from thence it exp cted assistance and fa∣vour, he also saw that as the cruel Serpent was about to kill the fair Pidge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, seven several Animals ap∣peared in order, who were all of different shapes, so that he could not distinguish what they were, yet they were so fair, that all that beheld them took plea∣sure therein; these Animals being arrived, one by one placed themselves to defend the young Pidgeon from the great Serpent, fighting for the Pidgeon one after another; so that in the beginning it seemed that the Serpent yielded, and yet afterwards he returned to assault the poor Pidgeon more fiercely than before; so that it was necessary that another of the seven A∣nimals should come to combate no defend it, and so there was seven assaults, during which the Emperor seemed to favour the Pidgeon against the Serpent, when the Serpent had the worst, and on the contrary
<PB N="305" REF="179"/> when the Serpent had the better, he altered his mind, and was pleased to help to kill the Pidgeon, for love of the Serpent.</P>
<P>In conclusion, he perceived that the Serpent raised himself higher than before, and casting forth all its poyson with the rage and fury that possessed him, he had so disordered the seven Animals, and the Pid∣geon which all that time had made no defense, that they seemed to be at the last gaspe of their lives, and that yet nevertheless the Pidgeon appeared then with so good a grace, and so great a vertue, that without fighting he overthrew and abased the Serpent, so that it remained upon the place not daring to stir, which the cursed and perverse Beast seeing it, imployed all its rage and venome against it self, so that it killed it self; whereupon the Emperor seemed to have then as much hatred as formerly he had love for it, very much repenting that he had so persecuted so pleasant a Bird as this Pidgeon was, at the desire of so horri∣ble a beast as was the Serpent; he also thought that all the City of <HI>Rome</HI> made Bone-fires for the delive∣rance and victory of the Pidgeon, so that nothing was heard throughout the whole City, but Drums, Trumpets, and other musical Instruments.</P>
<P>In conclusion the great noise which the people of <HI>Rome</HI> made at these Bone-fires, seemed to be so great that it awaked the Emperor just at break of day; then when the Sun-beams chased away the obscurity of the night, and being awake, he began to consider of the great dream he had in that hours time wherein he had slept; the apprehension of which, was so im∣printed in his mind, that he thought it rather a truth than a Dream; and yet he could not comprehend
<PB N="306" REF="179"/> one single point of it, although he could not remove from his fansie a thing that he had seen so perfectly, believing that it must necessarily have some great sig∣nification considering the impressi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n it had left in his mind, being thus very melancholly he arose, and soon after him the Empress; to whom a minute of an hour seemed to be a year, so desirous she was to be satisfied in the death of the innocent <HI>Erastus,</HI> and the seven Philosophers, who took part with him to maintain the just quarrel of their Disciple; and she was no sooner up, but she sent in great haste for those who had Commission to execute the sen∣tence of the Emperor against <HI>Erastus</HI> and the Phi∣losophers.</P>

<P>The Jaylor having heard the Message of Prince <HI>Erastus;</HI> went with all dilligence to the Emperours Lodgings, yet he doubted that he should be de∣rided, for delivering a Message from one that was Damb; but however he delivered what he had in charge to the Emperour, who understanding this new Embassy, remained very much perplexed and astonished, by means of what had newly hap∣pened. And although he believed that his Son had given that in charge to the Jaylor which he had delivered, yet he thought it very strange that he now speaking, he should all that time keep silent even, in those great
<PB N="309" REF="182"/> dangers wherein he had been and was still envolved, So that he sometimes resolved not to make any reckoning of him, considering the small esteem <HI>E∣rastus</HI> had for him, not vouchsafeing to speak and justi∣fie himself, when he had been charged with so great a crime; for which cause he believed he had just occasi∣on to be angry with his Son, who had so little re∣spected him, as not to pay him one civil salutation as in duty he was bound to, and for that he had not answered one single question, there having been so many propounded to him, whe efore he had conclu∣ded that this his silence was sufficient proof of his guiltiness, in so abominable a case as he had been charged withall: And then again natural affection and instinct, which induces Tygers to bear affection to their young ones (although they disdaine &amp; hate all o∣thers) induced and inclined the Emperour to give him audience; And thereupon he gave command to the Jaylor that <HI>Erastus,</HI> and the seven Philosophers should be brought bound before the Senate, being however resolved that so soon as he had finished his discourse, (which in his opinion could be nothing but to aske mercy and pardon) he should be publickly executed and with him the seven Philosophers, according to the Sentence formerly given, and the evening before con∣firmed, the news was already spread throughout all <HI>Rome,</HI> how that the Empress had the evening before obtained of the Emperour, that without any process or delay the young Prince <HI>Erastus</HI> and his seven Ma∣sters, should the next morning be publickly executed; so that before day break, the place of execution was full of Spectators to see the end and issue of this spectacle, every one believing it impossible that so
<PB N="310" REF="182"/> vertuous persons as the Philosophers, should be miser∣ably and publickly executed, with the only Son and heir of a <HI>Roman</HI> Emperour, and that their wisdome and vertue which was known to all, could not save them, not that none would engage in their rescue. The people being thus gathered together, some of them perceived the Jaylor when he went to the Em∣perour, and therefore followed him (being inquisi∣tive after news) but were hindred by the Guard from entring the Pallace, only some Noble men and per∣sons of quality were admitted, and were present when the Emperour commanded the Jaylor to bring forth the Prince; these relating this news abroad to others it was matter of novelty to all, as being of so great importance that it could not be hid in obscurity, so that at length it became so publick, that not only all in the Pallace was acquainted therewith, but also the whole City of <HI>Rome,</HI> and principally the Senators who had upon this occasion been already sent for, so that throughout the whole City there was a world of people of all sorts and qualities, men and women, great &amp; small, who being every where met together made it their whole business, all expecting the issue &amp; conclusion of the speech that <HI>Erastus</HI> would make be∣fore the Senate, where every one strived to get a place that they might hear what would be said. Only the Empress hearing of this news, began to suspect her af∣fair, as well in respect of certain remorse of conscience which pressed her, as for the novelty of the case, so that being retired into her Chamber, she ruminated in her thoughts the event of this discourse; and she already repented of the rashness of her pursuit: and then on a sudden she would take courage by a certain presump∣tion that had possessed her, and further enflamed her
<PB N="311" REF="183"/> with malice and ang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, setting good spies upon the place, to know when <HI>Erastus</HI> should be brought be∣fore the Emperour, and to give her an account of all passages that should happen. All the world being in this expectation, the young Prince <HI>Erastus</HI> arived, who went before his Masters, all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir hands being fettered and as strictly guarded as if they had been go∣ing to execution, as the Emperour had commanded; which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pectacle moved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll to compassion. But on the contrary, the young Prince marched with so much magnaminity and confide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce, that he appeared as if he had made a Triumphant entry, rather then to go to execution: And there did he see his Father sitting in the Senate, purposing not to be overcome by father∣ly love, although his Son should beg pardon or fav∣our but to leave him to the Justice of the Law. <HI>E∣rastus</HI> being come to a convenient place, with a voice high enough to be heard of all, began as followeth.</P>
<P>I deny not my Lord and Father, that the Creatures of this world every one in its kind do sometimes pro∣duce eff cts degenerating from their essence, so that there is noth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng here below that arives to an absolute perfection; but when this mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> happens to man to see wicked Children issue from good Parents, who however have taken pains to have them well bred up, and instructed such as these may be reckoned not to be men but brute Beasts. And therefore so much the more should I confess my self to be such, if I should commit, or think of committing so great a crime as that wherewith I am charged, and should be more Criminall then all men, both against Nature and the breeding that I have had, being naturally issued from your Royal

<PB N="313" REF="184"/> serve for my Justification, neither at the beginning when I was accused, nor during these days wherein my Masters here present have saved my life; so that this my silence hath had the power to induce those who consider things no further than their eyes de∣monstrate to them, to believe that I had commited this Villainous act wherewith I was charged, and that be∣ing surprized in the very manner, and knowing the Crime to be so hanious that there was no expectation of pardon; I was thereupon so confounded, that I was bereaved of my speech. But my silence was occasion∣ed by a higher cause, wherewith if you had been so well acquainted as were these my Masters, you would have known that it was impossible for me to do o∣therwise, without falling into an extream evill, which I could not avoid, it having been already allotted to me, and my only remedy consisted in being silent for these seven days, I very well knowing that my life was in great danger if it were not prolonged for that time, as well by the learned discourse of my Masters, as by the necessary silence which I have used. For these vertuous persons as well as I, did foresee on that day we received your commands to come to <HI>Rome,</HI> the great danger I should be in of a shamefull death, in co∣ming hither, for they are endowed with so great knowledge, that there are very few disasters which they do not foresee, and provide a remedy if there be any; it is very true that we could not possibly find out the means which should cause this disaster al∣though we were very well assured of the great danger I should be in for seven days; to avoid which, there was no other remedy but for that time for me to keep an absolute silence. This
<PB N="314" REF="184"/> we concluded to do rather than disobey your commands in not coming to <HI>Rome,</HI> doubting al∣so lest I should fall into some other inconvenience which should procure pour displeasure, and render me infamous to all posterity; and therefore hazarding all that might befal me, <HI>I</HI> resolved to continue seven dayes without speaking, assuring my self that my just cause would not fail me, being confident of the great vertue of these my seven Masters; who like vigilant and vertuous Advocates have alwayes oppo∣posed themselves against the fury of those who endeavoured the ruin of my life and honor.</P>
<P>And thereupon he gave a particular account of what they had seen in the Heavens and the Aspects of the Stars, that evening before they took their journey to <HI>Rome;</HI> and the resolution which he and his Masters had thereupon taken, in pursuance where∣of he had suffered very much, considering the great inconvenience caused by his silence, which gave oc∣casion to all people to believe that in regard he made no defence, he was guilty of the great felony where∣of he was accused; yet however his heart had not failed him, being assured that what was once esta∣blished and confirmed by the Caelestial influences; (that is if he continued silent) he should avoid that disaster; so that in conclusion he did not doubt but by this means all things would be well, notwithstand∣ing the impetuosity of the words, and storms which had so over-whelmed him; wherein the will of the Gods appeared to be different from that of men, for all mortal things are easily changed, whereas the will of God being immortal, remaines eternally immutable; so that what hath bin once determined
<PB N="315" REF="185"/> above follows by necessity, although it be by ordi∣nary means, notwihstanding all oppositions and con∣tradictions whatsoever, And that it is thus said the young Prince, I will prove it to you by the example of a very vertuous young man, and to whom Fortune was so contrary, that he who should have advanced him, endeavoured his death; and yet however he ar∣rived to be a King from being a mean personage, as the influences of the Stars had predicted, and that which was intended to hinder his greatness, was the means whereby he arrived to royal dignity.</P>
<P>And <HI>I</HI> now make it my humble request to you all here present to excuse the length of my discourse, in regard I have been silent so long, and now being at li∣berty to speak; I think it not to be inconvenient nor unreasonable, that I give my self this satisfaction, &amp; that I use my utmost endeavours to please my Audi∣tors, the matter in question being of so great impor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦ance to me.</P>
<P>Long time since in the <HI>Levant</HI> Countries, and par∣ticularly in the most illustrious and famous City of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> there lived a Merchant named <HI>Euro∣pus,</HI> who contrary to the custome and fortune of ma∣ny others, having a long time traffiqued with Mer∣chandise without any los<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, had so increased his riche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and arrived to so much wealth, that he had no mind to have any more; and contrary to the humor of most men, was content with what he had. This Mer∣chant being thus wealthy left of his tradeing, take∣ing no other thoughts but of advancing an only Son which he had, who was called <HI>Hermogenes</HI> to at∣tain to which he sent him to study, that he might fashion him to those things that were gentile and
<PB N="316" REF="185"/> honorable; and Fortune was so favourable to him in this enterprise, that in short time he saw his son ve∣ry well instructed in Learning and Armes, and in all other vertuous actions becoming a Gentle-man; yet however seeing that he was morose and melancholly, by reason he had no company in the house to con∣verse with at home, neither had he travelled abroad; for there is no better way to know the World than to travel in it, which gives a greater reputation to men, and is more profitable than to live alwayes at home in their Nests; wherefore that he might please him, he resolved to travel into several places, and ha∣ving made provision of moneys necessary for such an undertaking, and chosen out those that should ac∣company or attend him, he provided and furnished a Ship, wherein he and all his company embarqued, and having taken order about his Domestick af∣fairs, with the first good wind they set sail, and having sailed several dayes, and meeting with a storm, they made towards an Island where they landed; in this Island he had a mind to remain some dayes, as being a pleasant place; well ma∣nured, and the Inhabitants very civil and courte∣ous, but being desirous to pursue his Voyage, he embarkqued, when he and his son had no sooner left the shore but they saw two Birds as white as Swans, who hovered about their Vessel, and in the end perched on the Antient of the main M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, where they had not long rested, but they descended as if they would have setled on the head of the young <HI>Hermogenes,</HI> but soon re∣turned from whence they came, where they began to warble &amp; sing so sweetly &amp; harmoniously that one
<PB N="317" REF="186"/> would have imagined them to have bin Musitian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that endeavoured to shew their utmost skill and cun∣ning; so that all the Ships company, who were plea∣sed with their harmony, durst not stir for fear of di∣sturbing them; <HI>Europus</HI> who had formerly learned several words of the auguries of Birds, and their significations, bethought himself what this might mean, being ignorant whither it foretold good or e∣vil; and seeing his son very pensive, and yet never∣theless very pleasant in countenance, he said to him, is it possible that what I have formerly heard hath been true, that there are brute Beasts, who by extra∣ordinary gestures will foretel things to come; and that there are men so wise as to understand them? there is nothing more certain replyed young <HI>Hermo∣genes,</HI> for often times by these and such like means, some men have fore-told several accidents to come, a long time before they have hapned, and that their hearts might be enlightned, and be upon the greater certainty, they offered sacrifices proper thereunto; making use of many things that I shall not at present mention. If this be true said the Father, I would gladly know the meaning of the singing of these two Birds, if you are very desirous said young <HI>Her∣mogenes,</HI> for the Obligation which I have to obey you, <HI>I</HI> will give you that satisfaction let what will be∣fal me; and therefore you are to take notice that all which you have seen, and all the warbling of the Birds was made only in respect of me, and of my future greatness, for these Birds have signifyed no other thing but as they perched themselves so much higher than you are, so much hereafter shall <HI>I</HI> surpass you in greatness, in sign whereof they have begun to sing praises to me.</P>

<P>The Merchant <HI>Europus</HI> hearing this was surprized tither with Choller or Envy, or rather with both to∣gether, and in a great fury said, I will take order that this angury shall not take effect, and saying so, he took his son by the shoulders and threw him over∣board into the Sea; saying to those in the Ship, that although he desired his Sons advancement; yet how∣ever he intended not to make him greater than him∣self; and that he had rather choose to dye without an Heir, than to give the least respect in the world to his Son, and therefore he commanded instantly to hoyst up the sailes, and steer their course for <HI>Alexandria,</HI> certainly believing that his Son was devoured by the wave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, but it hapned quite otherwise, for he thinking to abase his Son, and to hinder the great∣ness that was prepared for him, he shortned his way thereunto; young <HI>Hermogenes</HI> than endeavouring to gain the shore by swiming so well as he could, a strong wind so assisted him, that in less than an hour he found himself ashore, on the same Island from whence they set out &amp; from whence his cruel father had cast him in∣to the Sea being much weary &amp; spent; yet the Islanders releived him so well (having compassion for the cru∣elty that had been shewed to him) that he in short time recovered, and having continued two dayes in that Island, he saw a very large Merchants Ship w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> endeavoured to take harbor there to refresh them∣selves, and take in fresh water, and considering with himself that to continue longer in that Island, his condition would not be better, he made his case known to the Master of the Ship, who was a rich Merchant of <HI>Candy,</HI> named <HI>Sterifo,</HI> who having dis∣coursed
<PB N="319" REF="187"/> with young <HI>Hermogines,</HI> and understanding from him particularly how every thing had hapned, he asked him what course he intended to take; to this the young man answered that he was content to what he sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld please to command him, if he would be pleased to accept of his service; whereupon <HI>Steri∣fo</HI> being very willing, accepted of him, and from that time <HI>Hermogenes</HI> disposed himself to serve him truly and faithfully, which he performed so well, that <HI>Ste∣rifo</HI> being childless and being out of hopes of having any Children, purposed to adopt the young <HI>Hermo∣genes,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeing his good and honest carriage, which was every way such as <HI>Sterifo</HI> desired in a Son, if he had had any; Being arrived at his house, and having acquainted his wife with his design, he found her very willing and free to it, and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on after they both declared him for their proper Child, and because of the bounty of Fortune which had been manifested towards him, they changed his Nam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and called him <HI>Entichus;</HI> that is to say <HI>Bonadventure,</HI> or good <HI>Ad∣venture,</HI> which being done you may understand that if at the beginning, a young man so well bred, had carried himself respectively towards <HI>Stirefo</HI> and his Wife when he was adopted, he then made it his Study to do much better, and with all fidelity, dili∣gence and readiness to apply himself to their ser∣vice.</P>
<P>It was about this time that the King of <HI>Candy,</HI> who was named <HI>Critorneus,</HI> that is to say a Judge of Birds, (whether that were his proper name or only impo∣sed on him) by a certain accident, was then in great trouble, and not knowing which way or how to de∣liver himself out of it, he counted himself to be un∣happy
<PB N="320" REF="187"/> and unfortunate, and being ignorant of the cause of this trouble; he Judged that some great mis∣fortune would befall him, and the <HI>Candiots</HI> his Sub∣jects had a bad opinion of him, supposing that this had happened in respect of some enormous Sin which he had Committed. And this was his affliction, so often as he went out of his Chamber three Crowes would present themselves before him, as if they had waited on purpose, which flew round about him fluttering and Croaking in such manner, that the poor Prince had his brains almost broken, so that he was forced to return into his Chamber from this mischief, being very desirous to be released, as his last refuge, he cau∣sed it to be proclaimed through all his Countries by Sound of Trumpets, and through all the Isle of <HI>Candy</HI> that if there were any one who could remedy this Croaking of the Crows, and deliver him from the trouble which they gave him; he would give them the one half of his Kingdome for their reward and if it were a man, he would furthermore give his onely Daughter in marriage to them.</P>
<P>This being Proclamed, many went to try their skill, thinking to deliver the King from the trouble of the Crows, some by Negromancy and the In∣vocation of Spirits, and others by certain Medeci∣nal compotsi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons and Ten thousand other experi∣ments, and yet there was none that could effect what they intended. The young <HI>Entichus</HI> un∣derstanding this news of the Proclamation of the King of <HI>Candy</HI> bethought himself that it
<PB N="321" REF="188"/> might happen to be he that should receive this great reward which the King had promised, since all con∣sisted in the Interpretation of the Gestures and Song of the Crowes, in which knowledge he was very well skill'd; and therefore he humbly entreated <HI>Steri∣fo</HI> (without whose commands he would undertake nothing) that he would please to give him leave to deliver King <HI>Gritorneus</HI> from the trouble of the Crowes, assuring him that he could easily perform it; to this the Old man consented, and he himself pre∣sented him to the King, who likewise promised him, that so soon as <HI>Entichus</HI> should have delivered him from the trouble wherein he was, he would perform the promise he had made, and confirmed it with an oath; whereupon young <HI>Entichus</HI> having made his Reverence to the King, he humbly entreated that it would please his Majesty to take the Aire out of his Pallace, assuring him that he would immeadiately acquaint him, with the occasion of the Croaking of the birds, and by that means free him from the trouble he was in. The King very readily performed this, but he was no sooner come out of his doors, but the Crowes came fluttering and Croaking more then ever they had done. The young <HI>Entichus</HI> said to the King, know Sir, that this Croaking and fluttering of the birds, comes not by any evil that is in you nor any other in your house, but these birds come to you to decide a difference which is between them: This Crow which is known by his feathers to be older than the other, took to wife this other which appears to be a Male but is a Female, but when a scarcity of provision happened, he hunted her away and would not keep her company, so that she joyned her self to
<PB N="322" REF="188"/> this young Crow, which is that in the middle; when there was victuals enough to eat then the old Crow would again have his Female, but she seemed to be discontented, and furtherfore the young Crow hoped to have some pleasure with the Female in that good season, since he had provided for her in the time of scarcity, &amp; this being in debate, &amp; they not agreeing there upon are com to you that by your royal authori¦ty whereby you make Laws and ordinances, that you would be pleased to put an end to their difference, by your definitive sentence; assuring you Sir, that so soon as you shall pronounce sentence they will be gone, and trouble you no further. The King hear∣ing what <HI>Entichus</HI> had said, adjudged by his absolute sentence the Female to the young Crow, and he had no sooner made an end of pronouncing his sentence but the Crowes flew away without ever returning again, to the wonder of all the Spectators, who much marvailed thereat, but above all the King was a∣stonished, and being transported ran to embrace young <HI>Entichus;</HI> telling him that from thenceforth he should take him and no other for his natural Fa∣ther, for said he I will perform my promise in giving you my Daughter and the half of my Kingdom, <HI>Enti∣chus</HI> making his due reverence to the King, humbly thanked him, and so they returned to the Pallace, the good old <HI>Sterifo</HI> being joyful of his Adopted Sons advancement after he had given him his best instructi∣ons and blessing, departed goeing home to his wife and leaving his Son <HI>Entichus</HI> at Court, both beloved and admired at by the King and all his Nobility, as well in respect of his Gallant deportment, as of his
<PB N="323" REF="189"/> kill and cunning, for he frequented Jousts and Tournaments in short time became so Compleat a Practitioner, that he excelled all others still bearing a∣way the Prize.</P>
<P>At this time there was an Emperour of <HI>Germany,</HI> whose name was <HI>Frederick,</HI> who was so accomplished a Prince in all endowments both of body and mind, that he excelled all the Princes, Kings, and Empe∣rours in the whole world. The same of this Empe∣rours vertues flying abroad into all parts, it came to the hearing of Prince <HI>Entichus</HI> (for so I may now call him, his vertue having procured him that Title) who being desireous of procuring fame abroad, as well as it home; and therefore purposing to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avell, and no place being so fit as he thought as the Court of the Emperour <HI>Fredrick</HI> he asked leave of the King to go thither. His request was not denied, only the King adv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed him to stay some time till honourable provision were made for him, that he might appear at the Emperours Court, in an equipage befitting the Son of the King of <HI>Candy,</HI> and that before he went he would perform what was at first intended, and was indeed necessary in marrying his Daughter. To this Prince <HI>Entichus</HI> replied, Most renowned King and honoured Father, I most humbly thank you for your great respect towards me, in condesending to give me attendance, and other equipage befitting your Son, but I desire you to spare that charge and trouble, for if my own vertues are not sufficient to to bespeak and make known my quallity, it will be in vain to have any other Ornaments; therefore <HI>I</HI> desire to go, although not altogether unaccompanied
<PB N="324" REF="189"/> and as a private person, yet to have as few as may be, and as little charge only your Letters Credenti∣als, that I may be received as your Son if I shall de∣serve that Title; and as to your other desire of my present marriage, I humbly and heartily thank you for your offer, and above all things accept of your Majesties Alliance, but desire the consumation there∣of may be deferred till my return, hoping then to bring so good a fame with me, as may in part merit the Illustrious Title of your Son-in-law, and there∣by render me to your Daughter more acceptable for her husband.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Entichus</HI> having finished his speech, which was dilligently observed by the King who knew it was modest and reasonable, he therefore consented thereto and gave him leave to depart accordingly first furnishing him with a sufficient quantity of Money and Jewels; and now in short time he arriv∣ed at the Court of the Emperour, who received him with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll Immaginable kindness: And there he be∣haved himself so well, that the Emperour made him his Carver. And soon after Prince <HI>Arthur</HI> Son to the King of <HI>England,</HI> arriving there was kind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y re∣ceived of the Emperour, and him he made his Cup∣bearer; And these two Princes <HI>Entichus</HI> and <HI>Ar∣thur</HI> were so like one another in face Proporti∣on, and voice, that they could hardly be distingui∣shed, and as they were alike in bodies, so they Loved each other with an entire and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ithful af∣fection.</P>
<P>The Emperour had only one Child and that was a Daughter who although she kept a Court by
<PB N="325" REF="190"/> her self and had servants of her own yet every day did the Emperour send her a dish from his own table by <HI>Entichus</HI> his Carver, who by that means had the opportunity of seeing her and the advantage to be e∣steemed by her; but he being one day absent from the Emperours Table, and the Emperour according to Custom intending to send to his Daughter; Prince <HI>Arthur</HI> performed that Office on his behalf, by this means he had the sight of the Princess <HI>Angelica</HI> (for so was she named) who perceiving that it was not <HI>Entichus,</HI> enquired his name and quality, and he having answered her departed, but although he was well in body, yet he was so sorely troubled in mind that not being able to hold up his head, he retired and went to Bed.</P>
<P>His friend Prince <HI>Entichus</HI> missing him, and doubt∣ing the matter to be as indeed it it was (for he un∣derstood that he had supplyed his place, in carrying a Dish from the Emperour to the Princess,) and he supposing that the sight of her, had wounded his heart with love; he therefore w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt to his friend <HI>Arthurs</HI> Chamber, and demanded the cause of his sickness, which Prince <HI>Arthur</HI> being unwilling to discover, made excuses, but <HI>Entichus</HI> being confirmed in his o∣pinion, declared it to his friend <HI>Arthur,</HI> who then could not deny, but that the Love of the Princess <HI>Angelica</HI> was the cause of his distemper; thereupon <HI>Entichus</HI> desired <HI>Arthur</HI> to be comforted, and he would assist him in all that he might, neither did he fail in his promise, for the next day he having the op∣portunity of waiting on the Princess, he presented her with a Rich Jewell of his own, but delivered it as sent to her by his friend <HI>Arthur,</HI> whose Love he
<PB N="326" REF="190"/> recommended to her and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me an humble Suitor to her in his behalf.</P>
<P>The Princess seemed to be offended with him for his boldness and charged him not to proceed in that manner, but however he took all opportunities of presenting her with Jewels from the Prince <HI>Arthur,</HI> and used all possible Arguments to induce her to pitty and love his friend; whereupon she who had borne some affection to himself, asked him why he had not spoken on his own behalf, to this he replied that he did not esteem himself so worthy as the Prince his friend, either in birth or otherwise, and besides that his heart had not as yet been wounded with love, as his friends was; wherefore there being so great a friendship between him and Prince <HI>Arthur,</HI> he thought himself oblieged to try all means to procure his satisfaction and therefore he was an humble Supplyant to her in his friends be∣half.</P>
<P>The Princess understanding thus much, and being enclined to love Prince <HI>Arthur,</HI> accepted of those pre∣sents that <HI>Entichus</HI> had offered, and at his entreaty was won to admit them both into her Chamber, at a time appointed that evening. This was good news to <HI>Entichus,</HI> who soon carried tydings hereof to his friend <HI>Arthur;</HI> who was in a manner ravished with joy at the recitall, so that he left his Bed and was immeadiately so well, that at the time appointed he went to visit his fair Princess; who received him kind∣ly at present and soon after was conquered with his Importunity and his friends courtship, so that he had freedome to be with her, when and as often as he pleased; but this affair was mannaged very privately
<PB N="327" REF="191"/> in regard the Empero<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s very cautious and vigilant over his Daughter, and many Courtiers who per∣ceived <HI>Arthers</HI> too much familiarity with the Prin∣cess; were envious thereat, and sought how to en∣trap him, but they were frustrated and disappointed in their contrivances, by the vigilance and valour of his friend <HI>Entichus;</HI> who oftentimes put his person in great hazard on his friends behalf.</P>
<P>The case stood thus with these Princes, when Let∣ters came to <HI>Entichus</HI> of the death of the King of <HI>Candy,</HI> and that he should return and take possession of his kingdom, this newes he declared to them who were right sorrowful for his departure, and so was the Emperor himself when he came to take leave of him; but however knowing that it was necessary for his advancement, he gave leave for his departure, most of the Court attended him part of his way, but particularly his friend <HI>Arthur</HI> and the Princess, who were grieved for the loss of his Company, he advi∣sed them to be very private in their meeting, telling <HI>Arthur</HI> that some one in time would discover his love to the Princess, if he were not very wary and circum∣spect, and that would be his ruine; to this be promi∣sed to take good heed, and Prince <HI>Arthur</HI> taking a precious ring from his finger, and giving it to Prince <HI>Entichus</HI> after strict embraces, and a solemn but sor∣rowful f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rewell, these friends and Lovers seperated, he pursuing his journey, and they returning to Court; where not long after <HI>Pharamond</HI> Son to the King of <HI>France,</HI> arrived and was admitted into the place of P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ince <HI>Entichus,</HI> which was much to the sorrow and trouble of the two Lovers, for
<PB N="328" REF="191"/> they were suspected and watched by Prince <HI>Phara∣mond,</HI> who was so curious in his search after the truth of their love, that he found it and discove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed them, and having some designs upon the Princess himself, and now finding all his hopes frustrated, he through rage and anger resolved to be revenged on them both; and therefore he publickly accused them both before the Emperor, who so soon as he heard of it was very angry, and sending for <HI>Arthur,</HI> told him of what he was accused, telling him that if it were proved, he should dye a shameful death; <HI>Arthur</HI> pleaded that he was innocent, and that he would prove it in Battel against his Accuser, to this the other consented, and the Emperor assigned them the day of Combat.</P>
<P>This was very unpleasant to Prince <HI>Arthur,</HI> but much more to the Princess, when he acquainted her therewith; but they seeing how their affairs stood, advised how to prevent the ensuing danger, for dangerous it would be for him to fight with <HI>Pharamond,</HI> who was not only a very valiant Knight, but had a just and true cause, which com∣monly is the occasion of the victory; whereas if he should fight in defence of an untruth and for that of which he was guilty, he might justly expect to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail, and be vanquished; this they both beleived would happen, and therefore consulted what to do, and thus it was, that they wanted the pre∣sence of their dear friend <HI>Entichus.</HI> This con∣sideration brought it into the minde of the Prin∣cess, how that they should accomplish their bu∣siness, and therefore she having thus advised her Lover; to take his opportunity very suddenly,
<PB N="329" REF="192"/> to speak with the Emperor, and tell him that he had received Letters from the King his Father, that he must needs go home suddainly, because he was sick; and therefore to desire his leave to dpart, and to give longer time for the Combat, which having obtained, to go then immediately to King <HI>Entichus,</HI> and desire his advice and assistance; Prince <HI>Arthur</HI> followed the directions of the Princess in all these particulars, and obtaining leave of the Emperor, he travelled so long that he arrived at the Court of King <HI>Entichus,</HI> and there privately be acquainted him with his af∣fairs, and the occasion of his journey; King <HI>Entichus</HI> was very glad to see him, and desirous to all things to advise and assist him but knew not how; there is no way but this replyed <HI>Arthur,</HI> that you return in my behalf, and not being known to be other than my self, on my befalf to perform the Battel and return; King <HI>Entichus</HI> approved of what his friend <HI>Arthur</HI> had pro∣pounded, but they were very much straitned for time in regard it was but eight dayes time to the day pre∣fixed for the combate, and if it were delayed for one day he could not possibly arrive there time enough, and he had invited all his Nobility on the next day to come to his Wedd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng. This was such an ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tacle as could not be removed or remedyed, and put them to their wits ends; but King <HI>Entichus</HI> being resolved to give an absolute proof of his friendship, and ha∣zard Kingdome, Wife and Life, and all rather than his friends should suffer in their honor, he therefore thus contrived the business; that Prince <HI>Arthur</HI> in all things resembling King <HI>Entichus</HI> should stay there, and as if it were he be married to his Queen, and hold all the solemnity of the Nuptials, only when he was in bed with her to forbear proceeding with her: and
<PB N="330" REF="192"/> that he would immediately return to the Emperors Court, and undertake the Combate, and if he ob∣tained the Victory suddainly return, and so might he do so too to his best beloved, this being concluded upon they seperated accordingly.</P>
<P>On the next day was solemnized the Wedding of Prince <HI>Arthur</HI> and the Queen, as if he had been King <HI>Entichus,</HI> and after much feasting, at night he went to bed with his Bride, but that he might per∣form with King <HI>Entichus,</HI> he laid a naked sword be∣tween them, and which she much wondred at, how∣ever he continued to do so all the time of the absence of his friend; King <HI>Entichus</HI> arrived at the Emperors Court, applyed himself to the Emperor, telling him that although his Father the King of <HI>England</HI> was very sick, yet as a true Knight he had left him, and was come at the time prefixed, to perform the ap∣pointed Combate, the Emperor received him kindly, and wished him good success, and so he went to his Lodgings as if he had been Prince <HI>Arthur,</HI> only the Princess entertained him privately, and understood from him in what condition he had left his friend, much wondring that there should be so much friend∣ship between them. The next day being the day of Battel, both the Champions being ready before the Combate began, King <HI>Entichus</HI> before the Emperor declared that if <HI>Pharamond</HI> did accuse him with in∣continence, or too much familiarity with the Princess <HI>Angelica,</HI> that the accusation was false and untrue, and that he therein lyed to the great dishonor of him∣self, the Princess, and of the Emperor, and that he was a false Kt. and that he was then ready to make good upon him in single combat. <HI>Pharamond</HI> hearing this protestation, answered, that what he had said was
<PB N="341" REF="193"/> true, and that he was ready to prove, and thereupon being both ready arth'd, they mounted their horses and began the combate which lasted not long, for K. <HI>Entichus</HI> being the better Warriour, soon vanquished his enemy, and cutting off his head, presented it to the Princess to her great joy; and to the satisfaction of the Emperor, and all the Court, who applauded King <HI>Entichus,</HI> supposing him to be Prince <HI>Arthur;</HI> but he having leave of the Emperor to go to his sick Father, as he pretended, and having taken his farewel of the Emperor and Princess, he departed not towards <HI>England</HI> as he pretended, but to his own kingdom; where he was privately but joyfully re∣ceived of Prince <HI>Arthur,</HI> to whom he gave a true ac∣count of the success of his journey, to his great sa∣tisfaction, who told him that he had saved his life and the Princesses; and therefore he was Debtor to him for both, not being able to requite such a peice of friendship but with his own life, which he would gladly at ony time off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r up for his service; this was the kindness between these two unparralled frinds, whose friendships exceeded all that was ever written, as in the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quel of my discourse you will understand, but at present after many kindnesses offered to one a∣nother, these two friends <HI>Entichus</HI> and <HI>Arthur</HI> sepa∣rated; <HI>Arthur</HI> returned to the E.

<P>This was the sad condition of the poor unfortu∣nate <HI>Entichus,</HI> but on the other side, Prince <HI>Arthur</HI> was as highly advanced, for his father the King of <HI>England</HI> dying, he became King, and the Emperour of <HI>Germany</HI> dying, and he marrying with the Princess <HI>Angelica</HI> he was crowned Emp.

The Servant told the Leaper that certainly his request would be refused, but however he would perform his desire; and thereupon went and told the Emperour, who hearing the name of his dear friend King <HI>Enti∣chus,</HI> was so charmed therewith that he presently con∣sented to the Leapers request, commanding that he should eat in the Hall at a Table by himself, and be respected as a person of honour; Dinner time being come, and the Emperour and his Courtiers being sat at Table the Leaper was also placed and served, and when he had eaten he desired one of the Servitors to go to the Emperour, and desire him for King <HI>Enti∣chus</HI> his sake to send him his best Bowl ful of Wine; This is an unreasonable request said the Servitor, for my Lord the Emperour will never drink in it again, if you should once touch it but however he went and delivered his Message to the Emperour who wondred at the request, but performed what was desired, and the Leaper receiving the Bowl drank off the Wine, and taking the Ring which formerly the Emperour had given him, put it into the Bowl and de∣sir'd the Servitor to carry it to the Emperor, who see∣ing the Ring and knowing it, was amazed believing he should hear something of his dear friend <HI>Entichus;</HI> wherefore he commanded that the Leaper should be look'd after &amp; conducted to his private Chamber that he might speak with him, this his commands was o∣bey'd, and he arising from Dinner went to the Leaper,
<PB N="334" REF="195"/> and being alone with him, he asked how he came by that ring, very honestly replyed the Leaper, I had it of the right owner, who said the Emperor King <HI>Enti∣chus?</HI> no said the Leaper, of <HI>Arthur</HI> Prince of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> that cannot be replyed the Emperor, for I am that <HI>Arthur,</HI> and I gave it to none but my dear friend King <HI>Entichus,</HI> that is confessed said the Leaper, and since you still call <HI>Entichus</HI> your dear friend, know that I am that unfortunate King; Oh what impossi∣bilities do you tell me said the Emperor! nothing but what is too true replyed the King with tears in his eyes, which by this time flowed too from the Empe∣rors eyes, down his cheeks in great abundance, but his greif and passion having had this vent for a time, he then ran to the Leap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rous King, and kissed and embraced him, crying out on my dear friend, how is this great mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtune befallen you; you replyed the King are the occasion of it, though I must confess you to be innocent, how said the Emperor could I your friend be the cause of this misfortune and yet be innocent: it is most certain replyed the King, for your friendship to me in lyi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g with my wife, and being innocent in not knowing her, she supposeing you to be me, hath so enrag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d her, that she revenged her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elf on me by poyson, which hath wrought this dismal effect upon me, so that your innocence occasi∣oned my ruine; and thereupon the King related the whole manner how it had befallen him, and how he was turned out of his Kingdome, Oh me unfortu∣nate said the Emperor! that I should occasion so much evil, that my dear friend who hath so often hazarded his life for me should be thus evilly recom∣penced through my occasion: I cannot (said the King)
<PB N="345" REF="196"/> complain of you, but of fortune, to whom we must all submit, well said the Emperor, since you are still Master of so much vertue continue it and hope the best; and <HI>I</HI> will endeavour your remedy if it may be done by the skill of any man, I will give a∣ny reward, nothing in my Dominions shall be wanting or spared that may do you good: the good King thanked him, and resolved to continue there unknown to all, to see if there might be any remedy for his infirmity.</P>
<P>In order to his cure the Emperor imployed all Phi∣sitians that he could here of, setting out Procla∣mations, that if any could cure this distemper, they should have a large reward; but when all was done they could do nothing, and so they told him, that it was not within the cure of Phisick, and that if he were ever healed it must be by miracle. The Emperor hearing this was very much afflicted, and being resolved to try alwayes for the restau∣ration of his friend, he applyed himself to all reli∣gious Persons and their prayers, neither was he wanting in his own, for he did not only make fre∣quent and daily prayers for his friend, but he set a∣part several dayes whereon he fasted and prayed up∣on this occasion; the good King <HI>Entichus</HI> was pati∣ent in this adversity, and yet prayed also to be de∣delivered from this evil if it might stand with the good pleasure of the Almighty, who in the end was entreated of him, and in a Vision told King <HI>Entichus</HI> how he might be cured: but it was by so strange means that he resolved rather to continue as he was than attempt it; for the Vision told him that there was other way for his recovery, but to be bathed in
<PB N="346" REF="196"/> blood of two Children of the Emperours which the Emperour must with his own hands kill, and after bath him with their blood; This was the only re∣medy prescribed for his malady, wherefore he purpo∣sed to be silent accounting it unreasonable to kill two Innocents to preserve one Sinner; but let him resolve what he pleases, it was the pleasure of heaven to re∣solve otherwise and as he had given an Unparalleld proof of his friendship to the Emperour, so the Em∣perour must retalliate and indeed exceed it in this great tryal of his naturall affection in preferring his friend before himself, for his Children may be term∣ed himself being the best part of him; wherefore that I may proceed you are to know that the Emperour still continued his prayers to heaven, neither was heaven silent, but in a vision told him that his friend <HI>Entichus</HI> knew how to be cured, he thereupon goes to him and desires him to tell him and that truly if he did not know of a remedy for his disease, to this af∣ter much importunity, <HI>Entichus</HI> not only told him that he did but also the manner now, but withall dis∣swades him from executing it; to this the Emperour replyed, that since heaven prescribed the remedy he would dispute no further but obey what was com∣manded; and thereupon went and Cut the throats of the two Innocents, and saving the blood and bathing his friends body therewith, he became as cleer and fair as ever, to the great joy of them both, the Emperour rejoycing that he had so good an opportunity as to give proof of his friendship.</P>
<P>The King being thus healed, it was thus agreed that he should leave the Court and go some few miles out of the Town, wherein he should have attendants
<PB N="347" REF="197"/> suitable to his quality, and then he should send word of his approach, and so should be met and entertain∣ed as to his dignity appertained; accordinly there came a Messenger the next day into the Emperors Hall, who gave the Emperor an account of the arri∣val of his friend King <HI>Entichus.</HI> The Empress hear∣ing of this news was joyful, and told the Emperor that by all means they must entertain their good friend very splendedly, and to that end said she, you with your Nobles, and I with my Ladies will go meet him; to this the Emperor agreed, and they rode together till they met him and received him with great reverence; and attending him till they came to the Pallace, where they gave him royal entertain∣ment.</P>
<P>Although the Emperor was joyful at his dear friends company, yet the Empress exceeded him in demonstration of her joye; which the Emperor ob∣serving, he told her that he was well pleased there∣with: wherefore said the Empress should I not ex∣press my joy to the heighth, for his company is more precious than all the Treasure in the World; for by his means you attained to this hono<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and dignity, and he hath often hazarded his life to save yours.</P>
<P>The Emperor hearing this, desired her to take good notice of what he should presently say; it is not long since (continued he) that a deformed Leaper was in my Court, I well remember him said the Empress, a most horrible creature he was indeed; suppose (said the Emperor) this Leaper were our friend King <HI>Entichus,</HI> and that there was no way to cure him of his loathsome Leaprosie, but by the death of both your children, in whose blood he must be
<PB N="348" REF="197"/> washed, could you for his sake suffer it. It is a very strange question replyed the Empress, but I thus re∣solve it, that had I ten Children, I would kill them all with my own hands, rather than our dear friend King <HI>Entichus</HI> should continue so loathsome a Lea∣per, for we might have more Children, but never such a friend as he. The Emperour hearing her constant speech, was resolved to make full tryal of her con∣stancy, and told her how all had hapned, and that her two Children were dead, she bearing this, notwith∣standing all her eouragious speeches, yet Nature so wrought with her that she sunk down in a swoun, but remedies being used she recovered; at the newes of the Emperours Childrens death, the Nurses went to see after them, when they came where they were, and expected to finde them dead, they saw the contra∣ry; for they were alive and singing, and about their Necks where they were cut, were Circles of Gold; this joyful newes was brought to the Emperor and Empress, who were exceeding joyful thereat, give-thanks to Heaven for this Miracle.</P>
<P>Soon after the Emperour raiseing an Army, went along with King <HI>Entichus</HI> to <HI>Candy,</HI> and overcoming an Army which the Queen and her Husband had raised, King <HI>Entichus</HI> was ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in put in possession of his Kingdome, and the Queen and her Husband slain,</P>
<P>And now the King being a single man, that these two friends might be allyed by marriage as well as affection, the Emperour having one only Sister, gave her in Marriage to his Friend King <HI>Entichus</HI>
<PB N="349" REF="198"/> and then these two great friends were again sepe∣rated.</P>
<P>The Emperour returning to his Empire, and the King remaining in peaceable and quiet possession of his Kingdom; and now he began to think of his old friends especially his Foster father <HI>Sterifo</HI> whom he ennobled with Titles of honour, and giving him an honourable and profitable employment at Court, had him near him as a Counsellor in all his affairs; and carrying himself courteously and justly to his Subjects, he was beloved of all them and feared of his enemies. Thus affairs grow∣ing every day better and better, it happened that in the Citty of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> which was his naturall Country, the great warrs, unfruitful seasons, and o∣ther bad influences had caused such a Scarcity of Victuals, that the g eate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t part of the inhabitants dyed with famine; so that the inhabitants of <HI>Alexandria</HI> were necessitated to travel into se∣veral Countries to get Corn for the poor, and therefore they made choice of the most expert and the most knowing men that they could find amongst them (who willingly accepted of the Imployment, because they were well provided with every thing) that from other parts they might relieve their Citizens, passing their time at the charge of others. Among the rest they made Choice of <HI>Europus</HI> the naturall Father of <HI>Enti∣chus,</HI> and who had thrown him into the Sea; who having taken Povt in the Isle of <HI>Candy</HI> where the Stars had so long before prepared a Crown
<PB N="350" REF="198"/> for him, he desired leave to buy up in that Island a great quantity of Corn, King <HI>Entichus</HI> being ac∣quainted herewith caused enquitey to be made, who they were that were in the Ship, and from whence they came, and being informed of the truth, and knowing the necessity of his Country, and the name of the Commander, and of the Ship, he did suspect that it was his Father; and therefore he purposed before he departed to make himself known to him, and to put him in mind of the great fault which he had committed. Whereupon having sent for him, to come to his Pallace pretending to discourse with him about other affairs, he cau∣sed him to stay and Dine with him: which invi∣tation he knowing not how to refuse, accepeted of w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th such honour and reverence, as hath been accusto∣med to be used by those who speak with Kings, Prin∣ces, and other great Lords.</P>
<P>Being at the Table, after that the King had suf∣ficiently informed himself of the estate of the City of <HI>Alexandria</HI> in generall, he questioned with his Father of his particular affairs, of his name, and how many Children he had? Where∣upon the Merchant having told his name, answer∣ed sighing that he had no Children, and that he never had but one, who perished in the Sea by a miserable misfortune.</P>
<P>It may be said the King your Son is not dead, for there is one here present who hath escaped from such a like misfortune as you speak of and as he saith he is the Son of a Merchant of the City of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and therefor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> advised him to
<PB N="351" REF="199"/> look about him, upon all the Company there present for it may happen that he may know his Son, before his Son did know him. The Merchant observing what the King had said, began to take notice of all those that were in the Hall; and on the other side every one looked upon him, believing that they should un∣derstand somewhat that was as yet unknown, and after he had well looked upon and taken notice of e∣very one, he said to the K ng that he could not find that his Son was there present, whereupon the King said, if you had well considered the Spectacle which you had of the two white Birds, and the interpre∣tation that was made to you, you would of your self have known that which I shall now tell you; for it was I my felf, whose way to greatness you would hinder instead of advanceing it as you ought. The good man hearing him speak of two white Birds, suddenly changed his Collour, being confounded within himself with shame; But when he heard this spoken to his face and in the presence of so many great Lords, the occasion that had moved him to such an excess, he g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew pale and red both at once; and know∣ing no other way to make amends for his faults, he arose from the Table and cast himself at his Sons feet asking him p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rdon. But the King who was no less generous then great and puissant took hold of him and raised him, praying him that forgetting what was passed he would make use of that power which God had given him and that he would rest con∣tented that he had made him know by effects that it is impossible to interrupt or hinder that which the pleasure of God hath once ordained; and so having
<PB N="352" REF="199"/> sent by others a sufficient quantity of Corn for his Country, he caused his Father to remain with him, taking order to bring the rest of his family to <HI>Candy,</HI> to participate of that good fortune which had befallen him, contrary to all humane thoughts and which he had well and wisely persued.</P>
<P>By this Example (said <HI>Erastus</HI>) and many others as admirable as this, which I could relate; we may assuredly conclude that whatsoever hath been once ordained and established above, doth usually come to pass, so that nothing here below can obstruct or hin∣der it; being assured of this, I and my Masters did ex∣pose our selves to very great hazard and danger, in our coming to <HI>Rome,</HI> and the only remedy that we had was for me to be silent for the space of seven days, in doing whereof the heavens promised me a good issue and deliverance, provided that some would defend my cause, for that Term; the which my seven Masters like prudent and valliant Champions have done: I therefore resolved to follow the right re∣medy which had been prescribed me, for the conser∣vation of my life and honour, the which otherwise I should have dishonourably lost (as the heavens had let me know) soon after my arrivall at <HI>Rome,</HI> the shame whereof would have been much more grievious to me, than the death wherewith I was threatned. Behold then what hath induced me and indeed enforced me to be Dumb these seven days, which I suppose hath been as much to your astonishment, as my trouble to see my self constrained by a fatall silence to confirme the opini∣on
<PB N="354" REF="200"/> that every one might have, that I would commit an action so wicked and wretched, as that which hath been falsly charged on me by the Empress; who be∣ing a woman and naturally enclined to be fickle and angry, and having been lately in love with me, it is no wonder if she hath converted that love which she first shewed me into a mortal hatred, endeavour∣ing to make me dye who am her Son in Law, as it hath frequently befallen others who without any reason have prosecuted their Sons in law, either through hatred or anger. As for hatred we may finde examples enough in antient Histories; as that which <HI>Jur</HI> conceived against <HI>Phrisso</HI> and <HI>Helle,</HI> and of the <HI>Modern</HI> Histories there are enough; and of hatred we may read how the cruel <HI>Phedra</HI> treated the inno∣cent <HI>Hipolitus,</HI> whose companion I had certainly bin, both in cause and miserable death; if the evi∣dent danger wherein I was, had not been manifested to me by Heaven, and the means to escape it, the which I have hitherto done by the good assistance of my Masters here present, to whom I am indebted, not only for the good instructions I have received of them but also for my life; as for the crime wherewith <HI>A∣phrodicia</HI> hath endeavoured to cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge me which is that I attempted to force her, and confirmed the truth of this outrage by my flight, it had been very easie for me to manifest my innocence, and her incontinence, if I had permission to speak, but knowing very well by the course of the Stars that my speech would not have de∣livered me from danger but rather have plunged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s into a bottomless pit of misfortune, <HI>I</HI> have
<PB N="355" REF="200"/> been constrained to endure these dayes past all the Calumnies that have been charged upon me, that I might now discharge my self, and mak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my Innocence appear to all the World, I being unwil∣ling to advance before my time, lest I should at once loose both life and honor.</P>
<P>And now before I proceed any further, may it please you Sir, to grant me this favour, to cause the Empress to appear before you and the Senate, that the truth of what I shall speak may be cleered, and that you may not think <HI>I</HI> have contrived what I have spoken, as she hath falsly contrived the Im∣putation wherewith she hath charged me, miserably to ruine both my life and renown: yet however I do not desire the same manner of proceeding against her as hath been used against me; that is to begin with execution before the matter of fact in deliberatly debated, but I desire that the truth may be known by the confronting of the Parties, and that what term she pleases may be given for her justification, entreat∣ing you Sir to believe that what I shall propose to the Empress when she is present, to be for the discharge of my innocence, and the cleering of the truth, and not to imagine that I shall speak or propose any thing whatsoever for revenge, for it will never enter in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the heart of any man of honor to revenge himself upon a woman. This Oration of Prince <HI>Erastus</HI> was spoken with so much confidence, that not only the Emperor, but also all the Senators, and generally all those who had heard him speak were astonished, &amp; thereupon without any contradicton it was conclu∣ded &amp; ordered that the Empress should be immediate∣ly sent for, who understood by her spies with what
<PB N="355" REF="201"/> courage the Prince <HI>Erastus</HI> had spoken before the Se∣nate, and doubting what would become of her, she purposed to have fled, and by that means to escape the danger, but it was too late, for she had no soon∣er taken this resolution, but those whom the Empe∣ror had sent, came and surprized her; at whose arri∣val she lost courage, and was so out of countenance, that understanding the charge which they had from the Emperor, she could not give one word of answer, being pale and trembling not knowing what to do or say; whereupon those who were sent for her did easily conjecture that the case of <HI>Erastus</HI> was other∣wise than she had represented it, seeing that she was so confounded at her being carried before him. In this distracted condition they conducted her from the Pallace, into the Hall of the Senate, at whose ar∣rival all the Senators arose, making reverence to her, who took no notice of them; whereas formerly she was used to be so complaisant that she returned all sa∣lutations, not only to the Senators, but also to the meanest person in <HI>Rome,</HI> this fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ceness was observed by all, being sate down by the Emperors side in a dif∣ferent posture from what she was used to, Prince <HI>E∣rastus</HI> pursuing his discourse, did particularly declare from the beginning to the end, all that had passed between him and her, beginning with the letters and rich presents which she had sent him before his comming to <HI>Rome,</HI> which might be attributed to a loving and Motherly affection, if she had not proceeded further; but no sooner was he come thither, when she made cleerly evident the dishonest intentions that she designed by
<PB N="356" REF="201"/> those presents, endeavouring at the beginning by smooth and amorous speeches, and after that by dis∣ordinate and luxurious gestures, to induce him to vi∣olate the holy and sacred marriage of his father; and in conclusion endeavouring to have her pleasure with him by force: whereupon he had rather chosen to fly from her, than to stain his hands in her motherly blood, in revenging the great outrage she intended a∣gainst his Father; according to the enormity of the case, considering the violence she used to him, but she seeing that the case was otherwise than she ex∣pected, measuring the continence and chastity of o∣thers, according to her own disordinate appetite; through rage and anger to see her self so slighted, (as it is usual for women in her condition to do) or else doubting that he would discover this villany to the Emperor his Father, who might punish her as she justly deserved, took her advantage seeing him take his flight out of her Chamber, to cry out a Rape, and say that he would have forced her, confirming her re∣port by his suddain flight, assuting her self that this would be sufficient to move the Emperor and every body else, the truth being so apparant, to kill him immediately, being surprized in such an action, with∣out giving him leasure to justifie himself; and by this means failing in the satisfaction of her disordinate appetite, she might have the content to be revenged. To which design of hers at the beginning Fortune had been as favourable to her, as contrary to him, in winding him into this Labrinth; at such a time as the Heavens would not permit him to speak, whereby all men might beleive that he was guilty of the crime whereof he had been accused; true it is, that accord∣ing
<PB N="357" REF="202"/> to the instability and ordinary inconstance of For∣tune, she had turned her wheel, giving opportunity to his Masters to stay the execution of the sentence against him, until he had the liberty of speaking, to manifest the matter as it had passed.</P>
<P>And here did Prince <HI>Erastus</HI> apply every thing to his purpose, which might be material to the conser∣vation of his life and honor; sometimes he would ad∣dress himself to the Empress, rehearsing to her the ve∣ry speeches she had used to him in her Chamber, with her luxurious and disorinate gestures whereby she endeavoured to induce him to let loose the Reynes of his continence, oftentimes asking her wherefore and for what cause she would thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aint an Imperial family with so villanous an action; to this the misera∣ble woman knew not what to answer, seeing her folly and treason so apparant in the presence of the Empe∣ror, and so many persons of honor which were there present, but her eyes were continually fixed on the ground, often changing her color, shrinking up her shoulders and sighing continually; which things ser∣ved as an absolute index to prove the speeches of P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: <HI>Erastus</HI> to be true, who was so eloquent and lively in his defence, that he not only drew to his side the Se∣nate, and others who loved and reverenced him, but also the friends and relations of the Empress, (who the evening before being seduced by the fraudulent speeches of <HI>Aphrodicia,</HI> had procured that without a∣ny delay Prince <HI>Erastus</HI> should be dispatched and with him the seven Philosophers) who were the first that declared the Prince to be innocent, casting themselves at his feet, and asking him pardon and mercy, most humbly entreating him that he would forget the pro∣secution
<PB N="358" REF="202"/> which they had made against him, for that they as well as the Emperor had bin cunningly sedu∣ced; and for satisfaction if no others should, they themselves would take a revenge according to the quality of the crime against her, who by so great treason had abused them; hereupon Prince <HI>Erastus</HI> re∣ceived them very courteously, with a free and cleer countenance, and he and his seven Masters being un∣bound, he went directly towards the Emperor, who having retained all that his Son had said, how every thing had passed, he bethought him of his dream, understanding the truth of the Vision that had the night before appeared to him; and therefore ariseing from his Imperial seat, he went to his Som imbraceing him so loveingly that the tears flowed from his eyes, to see him in a manner raised from death to life, as well in body as in honor, which he esteemed more highly than life; and being about to excuse himself for those rigorous courses which had bin used against him, the young Prince interrupted his discourse, saying that his fatal silence was the cause of all, where∣of having said enough before the Senate he should forbear to speak further, only he intreated him to de∣clare plainly if he yet had any scruple of his being guilty, which was not cleered to him, so that he might fully justify himself; whereupon all the Senate una∣nimously answered him, that they esteemed him suffi∣ciently justifyed and innocent of that wherewith he had bin accused, and after some further discourse the Emperor caused him to sit down by him, to consult what should be done with the Empress; whereupon the Emperor (having learned by the pains &amp; trouble he had lately suffered) speak aloud that by experi∣ence
<PB N="359" REF="203"/> found it to be an unjust thing for a man to be a judge in the matter wherein he himself was concern'd and therefore he would not meddle with the proceedings about the Empress; but remit all to the judgement of the Senate to proceed as they should finde cause, without respect to any person; and accordingly by order of the Senate, the Empress was delivered into the Custody of some of the principal Senators until the next day, when they would consider what way to proceed against her; and if she should not at all justify her self, (as every one beleived it to be im∣possible) that sentence should be justly executed on her, that she would have unjustly caused to be exe∣cuted on the Prince; and that in the mean time all things should be taken from her, wherewith she might offend or kill her self through despair.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXIV.</HI> The Empress <HI>Aphrodicia</HI> understanding the desperate∣ness of her condition, being in Prison desperately killed her self.</HEAD>
<P>SO soon as Prince <HI>Erastus</HI> was restored and con∣firmed according to his place and quality, the fame thereof was presently spread through all the City, by means of the great multitude who were assembled at the Pallace, to understand how the Case would be with Prince <HI>Erastus,</HI> which having had an honorable issue, all the <HI>Romans</HI> both general and par∣ticular, made the greatest feast in the World; in such manner that there was no Man or Woman, young nor old, great nor small, but laid aside all bu∣siness, though never so importunate; and hastening to the Pallace endeavoured to see the face of the Victorious and Triumphant <HI>Erastus;</HI> so that no tri∣umphant entry that was ever made in <HI>Rome,</HI> had caused so great a croud of people in all the streets, nor no joy more general nor more common; every one speaking so highly and advantageously as possib∣ly could be of Prince <HI>Erastus;</HI> who for his part re∣ceived all the people and saluted them with an incre∣dible modesty; letting them understand that he knew how to keep a <HI>medium</HI> without being elevated in pro∣sperity,
<PB N="361" REF="204"/> as his spirits had never failed him when he was in adversity; but it was far otherwise with the unhappy <HI>Aphrodicia,</HI> who finding her self in the night time locked up in her Chamber, which those who had the charge of her had provided (they having offe∣red her two Damsels to keep her company, which she resolving to be alone had refused) she began to curse herself, the Heavens and Nature, and being enraged wished that before her death, that it were in her power to ruinate not only her Son in law, but also the Emperor himself, the Senate, the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> the Empire, and all the world together; and having a long time continued in these wicked meditations, and finding that this would be much more diffi∣cult than her former enterprize against the life of her Son in Law, she converted all her rage towards her self; and considering her self to be culpable not of the crime, which she intended to commit against her Husband, but that she enterprized a matter which she could not effect, she attempted to be, revenged on her self, and to dye by her own hands. And not finding any thing to make a cord to strangle her self &amp; much less any thing to stab her self withal, she then found her self truly miserable, in that she was necessitated to dye of a violent death, and yet had not the means to execute her desires; this consi∣deration brought her into so great an Agony that she fell upon the floor in a swoon, in which she continu∣ed a long time without any knowledge, but in time she recovered, wherefore out of despite that she was come to her self, she afresh cursed ner self and her life, through rage and anger tearing her garment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in doing whereof she saw she had fetched blood on one of her
<PB N="362" REF="204"/> fingers, whereupon she search'd dilligently for that which had caused it, to see if therewith she might make a larger wound, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reby her Soul might make its issue out of her miserable body: Upon this curi∣ous search she found a bodkin, wherewith she was used to prick out figures in parchment to divert her self, and this she had stuck into her Clothes as wo∣men are used to do, without being taken notice of by her Attendants; they having been commanded to take from her every thing that might hurt her, but this bodkin was so Cunningly hidden that it was im∣possible to be found. Having found this bodkin she took it in her hand, and casting her self on her bed she said see what I am enforc'd to, Ah bodkin! thou hast ere now when I us'd thee, diverted me from me∣lancholly thoughts, but now thou must be instru∣mentall to deliver me from the sadest melancholly that ever any was possessed with. This bring uttered with a firme resolution she fixed this bodkin under her left breast, and with her finger thrust it so strong∣ly that it entred up to the top, so that having pierc∣ed her heart it was not long before death seized her; yet she lay rather like a sleeping than a dead woman.</P>
<P>At the break of day those Lords who had the charge and keeping of her, sent several Damsels to see how it was with the Empress, who opening the Chamber door very softly and seeing her lye on the bed thought that she had slept, not immagining that it was her last long sleep as indeed it was and there∣fore that they might not awak her they returned to those that had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent them, telling them that the Empress was fast asleep; whereupon those Sena∣tors that had the charge of her were amazed, won∣dring
<PB N="363" REF="205"/> that one in her condition could sleep so soundly. The Sun being risen they went to the Senate, which on that occasion was so early assembled; where be∣ing come, they advised how they should proceed in this affaire, and they concluded that all manner of advantage allowed to Criminals, should be permitted to the Empress, that she might Justifie her self, that she should have leave to choose one or more Advo∣cates to plead her cause, either in her presence or in her absence, as she should think fit. This being de∣termined by the Senate, those who had the Empress in Custody were sent to fetch her, that she her self might see the fair means they would use in her cause, notwithstanding the great rigour and precipitateness which she had used against Prince <HI>Erastus.</HI> The Gentlemen being arrived at the lodging where the Empress was deteyned, sent the same Damsels that had been there in the morning to see what she did; who finding that she had not stirred, carried back word to the Gentlemen that she was not yet awake: Whereupon the Gentlemen wondring resolved to awake her, and thereupon entring into the Chamber with the Damsels they opened the Windows, and seeing that for all that she stirred not, one of the Damsels called softly, <HI>Madam, Madam;</HI> To which she not answering all who were in the Cham∣ber seeing her so pale did believe that some accident had happened, which was very likely in regard of her great trouble: yet nevertheless seeing that for ought they could do by throwing water on her face, she came not to her self, they therefore sent for the Emperours Physitians, who being come and having felt her pulse concluded that she was dead. The
<PB N="364" REF="205"/> Senate was advertised hereof, but none could Ima∣gine that any trouble of mind though never so sud∣den could have the power to kill, for that griefs though never so great, have not the porwer to op∣press &amp; suffocate the vitall spirits as an excess of joy. And therefore searching very dilligently over all the body of the Empress to see if they could find how she came by her death, they found nothing but a scratch which the bodkin had made on her fing∣er, which gave little light to the Physitians, they Judging it to be impossible that so little a scratch should cause her death, in regard they could not find that it was envenomed: In fine one of the Physitians observing a little blood to be under the Empresses left brest, he put his finger there and feeling some∣thing hard, he pressed his finger so that he felt the bodkin, which being pluck'd out did plainly shew how it had happened. Which being reported to the Emperour, he was at first much moved; Yet however being unwilling to hinder the course of justice, he referred to the Senate to do what they thought fit to the body of the Empress; consider∣ing the great Felony which she endeavoured to commit to the Emperour, and the Treason which she had contrived against the life of the Inno∣cent <HI>Erastus:</HI> But the young Prince who above all things abhorred cruelty and vengance, seeing his in∣nocence fully and entirely justified to all the world, which was the only thing he desired, would in no wise permit that any shame should be done to the bo∣dy of the Empress, this he easily obtained both of the Emperour and Senate to the content of all; so that her Funerall was c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lebrated, as belonged to an
<PB N="365" REF="206"/> Empress as may be seen by the sumptuous Tomb that was made for her, which remaineth to this day, where the Emperor caused an Epitaph to be ingraved which in few lines contains the whole matter, which is more amply specified in the Histories and Chroni∣cles of the <HI>Romans.</HI> The Emperor <HI>Dioclesian</HI> whether out of grief or otherwise, did not long out live his wife, having first elected his Son for his Copartner and successor, who being come to the Empire chang∣ed his name, governing his estates for a time with much prudence, according to the great wisdom where∣with he was endowed, and yet notwitstanding all his judgement he could not keep himself from giving too much credit to the speeches of his malignant wife; although the Plots and contrivances which women had contrived against him, should have fore-warned him; but it is very difficult to avoid that which the Heavens have determined, and since both the one and the other History have seemed to me worthy of me∣mory, I have committed them to writing for the profit of posterity.</P>
<P>This i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the conclusion of the History of the Prince <HI>Erastus,</HI> and his seven wise Masters, as I have transla∣ted it from the Originals, <HI>Italian</HI> and <HI>french:</HI> but in an old English book it is very different, as well in se∣veral places as I have already recited, as also in the conclusion, being the manner of the Empresses death, which is thus related.</P>
<P>The eighth day being come wherein the Prince re∣solved to be no longer silent, but speak in his own defence, and acq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ainting his Keepers with his in∣tention,
<PB N="366" REF="206"/> he was carried before the Emperor and Se∣nate, after due reverence to his Father, and excuses he gives his reasons for his silence, and for a proof of his innocence of what the Empress had charged him with, he chargeth her with incontinence and a∣dultery, and the Empress and her Damsels being sent for at the Princes request, one of the supposed Dam∣sels being stripped naked before the Court, proves to be a man so disguised, with whom the Empress was used to accompany and often lye, this being a certain proof of the Empresses guilt. The Emperor commanded that both she and the Ribauld her com∣panion should be immeadiately burnt: but the Son de∣sired him to forbear judgement till she were reproved for her fact. The Emp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ror then committed the full judgement to his Son, who particularly related how things had passed between him and the Empress, she seeing her wickedness discovered, fell at the Em∣perors Feet, and crying for mercy, but he wholly re∣fused her, relating the haniousness of the crimes which she was not able to deny; wherefore the Son demanding justice of the Judges and Justices, they pronounced this Sentence against her, that she should be bound to a horses tail, and drawn through all the streets of the City, to the place of Execution and there burnt; And that the Ribauld should be quartered and his flesh cast to the Hounds, and Birds of the Aire to devoure him, and this was executed upon them.</P>
<P>This is the Conclusion of the Empress as it is related in that former Book, now the Reader having read what both conclude, are left at liberty to believe which they please; and thus have I given
<PB N="367" REF="207"/> you a full and particular account of all that I can find Written in any Language, of this Prince <HI>E∣rastus</HI> and those Famous Philosophers the Seven Wise Masters of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
