<HEAD>¶To the right honorable <HI>Sir Henrie Sidney, Knight of the most</HI> Noble order of the Garter, Lorde <HI>President of Wales, and Marches of the <HI>same, Lord Deputie Generall of the Queenes Ma∣iesties</HI> Realme of Ireland. Your humble</HI> Orator Thomas Hacket wisheth the fauoure of God, long and happy life, encrease of ho∣nor, continuall health and felicitie.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>One are more to be</HI> commended (right Hono∣rable) than those who wer the first inuenters and fin∣ders out of Artes and Sci∣ences, wherwith mankind is beautified and adorned, without the which giftes he were but naked, barba∣rous and brutish, yea and a seruile creature. It was not for nothing that the elders in times past did so muche celebrate the instituters of those things: as <HI>Herodotus</HI> wri∣teth, that the Egiptians before all other men first foūd out the yere by the course of the Planets, and deuided it into .xij. mon∣thes. <HI>Diodorus</HI> assigned it to the <HI>Thebanes,</HI> the which stan∣deth well with the opinion of <HI>Herodotus,</HI> bicause the <HI>The∣banes</HI> be a nation of Egipt. As <HI>Numa</HI> added to the yere Ia∣nuary and February, <HI>Romulus</HI> ordred Marche, Aprill, and May, <HI>Augustus</HI> an other part, and so <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> made vp
<PB REF="3"/>
the perfect yere, as <HI>Polidorus Vergilius</HI> witnesseth in his boke <HI>De inuentoribus rerum.</HI> But how much praise is to be giuen to such as haue inuented good lawes &amp; statutes for the bride∣ling of the Barbarous and wicked, and for the maintayning and defending of the iust? As we reade that <HI>Isis</HI> ariuing in <HI>Egipt,</HI> brideled that Countrey, and ordained good common wealths. How did the <HI>Scicilians</HI> honor <HI>Ceres,</HI> for that she was the first inuenter of wheat sowing, with other innumerable? Among all other, none in my iudgement is more worthier to be praised, thā the first finders out how to make ships and ves∣sels nauigable for the sea. <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth that <HI>Minos</HI> king of <HI>Crete,</HI> had the first rule of the sea. But <HI>Diodorus</HI> sayth, that <HI>Neptunus</HI> had the Empire of it afore him, for he inuented the feat in rowing of boates, and made a nauie, and was made Admirall of it by his father <HI>Saturnus,</HI> and <HI>Plinie</HI> reporteth that King <HI>Erichthas</HI> deuised boates first, and rowed in them on the Red sea. Some say they were ordained by the Troyans in the narow seas called <HI>Hellespontus:</HI> some thinke they were inuented in the English sea. <HI>Danus</HI> as some write, was the first that vsed any ship when he sailed out of Egipt into Grece. But for more assurance, what so euer their opinions be, as touching the beginning hereof, (as we rede in the holy scripture) <HI>Noe</HI> was the first inuenter or maker thereof, before the floud. The ingenious industry of man hath brought many things to a no∣table and good perfection, as well in Cosmography and Naui∣gation, as in any other arte or science: for no doubt, (as it ape∣reth by this trauaile or worke of Cosmography &amp; such like,) the olde ancient writers, as <HI>Ptholomeus</HI> and others, were de∣ceiued, in that they iudged this Newe found Worlde, or the West part to be vnhabitable. How muche are they to be prai∣sed, that for their Countrey sake refuse no imminent perill, leauing the Pleasaunt bedde of Delicacie, and the seate or cradle of Sensualitie, their landes and goodes, their Wiues
<PB REF="3"/>
and children, which in dede, are dearest vnto them, to aban∣dō themselues and their swetest liues to the fauoure of the boy∣strous seas, to the hap of the vnconstante windes, to the chayre of fortune, and finally to a thousande imminent euils, onely to encrease the fame and good renowme of their countrey. A∣mong the which I might rehearse, that this most noble Seig∣norie and Territorie of England hath of late yeares gotte the fame and renowme, that it hath had in times past, by Naui∣gation lately atempted by many and sundrie of our countrey∣men, (God graunte them still to go forwarde and encrease in those and such like enterprises, to Gods glory and the benefite of this common Wealth.) But alas, the greater number of mē are giuen to idelnesse or sensualitie, as if I mighte say nowe: where are the <HI>Tiberians,</HI> the <HI>Metelli,</HI> the <HI>Emili,</HI> the <HI>Marij</HI> and the <HI>Catones</HI>? Among the number of a great many, and in the middest of aboundance and pleasure, we meditate no∣thing else but onely securitie, almoste abhorring to heare the name of trauell or payne, by which it may be sayde to vs, in a manner, as it was sayde of <HI>Haniball,</HI> after the battell <HI>Tra∣simenius</HI> or <HI>Cannas,</HI> that his wintering at <HI>Capua</HI> in pleasure and delicacie was more noysom and hurtfull vnto him, than either of the battels before named. We reade after that <HI>Ale∣xander</HI> had vanquished almost the thirde parte of the world, hauing ouerthrowē the mighty King <HI>Porrus</HI> one of the stron∣gest Kings of <HI>India,</HI> with whom (as rehearseth <HI>Plutarche</HI> in the life of <HI>Alexander</HI>) he among all other had moste to doe, hauing also subdued vnto him the mighty King <HI>Darius,</HI> hea∣ring the Philosopher <HI>Anaxagoras,</HI> in a certayne lecture, hol∣ding this opinion, that there were Worldes out of number, therewith he burste out sodaynely into weeping, his friendes moued with this sight, demaunded whether any mishap had fallen vnto him mete to weepe for or no, he sayde these wordes: Oh, haue I not good cause to weepe trowe ye, that
<PB REF="4"/>
there being worlds innumerable, I am not yet come to be full Lorde of one? of whom I gather the inceasable stomake, glory and renowme, how little he estemed him selfe and his King∣doms, without the name of victorious and mighty. Among and aboue all (as affirmeth <HI>Plutarchus</HI>) he estemed the <HI>Ilia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of <HI>Homer,</HI> bicause in the same was declared the excellent prowes of <HI>Achilles.</HI> Thus (right honorable) we see, the valiant and curagious personages of the world haue brought to passe many excellent enterprises, so that their fame shall neuer dye, atcheued as well by sea as by lande, as this worthy traueller <HI>Andrewe Theuit,</HI> in this his Nauigation of the New found World, which I haue dedicated vnto your honor, as a tokē of my good will, the which after your great &amp; waighty affaires, it may please you to vse, and to pardō this my rash enterprise, wherein I am enboldned to prefer this towards you, as a thing very rare, and of such exquisite doing, as before this time the like hath not ben heard of, whose annotations therin be such, as no Cosmographers hereto before haue done the like: desi∣ring your honor so to accepte the same, as the good will of him that gaue it. And thus I commit your good Lordship to the tuition of God, who preserue you and all yours in health and eternall felicitie. Amen.</P>

<HEAD>¶An Admonition to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Doubt not gentle Reader, but that the description of this present historie wil make thée to wonder, as well bicause of the varietie of things that herein then mayst Reade, as also of many others whiche at the firste wil seme vnto thée rather monstrous than naturall. But after that thou hast soberly wayed &amp; considered the great effects of our mother dame nature, I doe surely beleue y<SUP>t</SUP> such admiratiōs shal haue no more place in thée. Also let it not seme to thée strāge the setting forth of many strāge trées, as Palme trées and others, with beasts of the fielde and foules of the Ayre, the which are cleane contrarie to the setting forth of our Cosmographers and Anciente writers, who for bicause that they haue not sene the pla∣ces, and for the smal experience and knowledge that they had, did greatly erre. But if thou herein stande in doubt, then those that haue trauelled thether, and those <HI>Indians</HI> that were brought frō thence, can affirme al things here∣in contayned to be true. Furthermore if that there be here in this booke any wordes that seme to thée rude or il placed, thou shalt therefore accuse the feuer and death, (y<SUP>e</SUP> feuer) which hath so kept or cleaned to the Author since his returne home, that he had no leasure to peruse his boke before that it came to the Printer, being prouoked to deliuer it at the commaundement of the Cardinall of <HI>Sens:</HI> and death which happened to <HI>Ambrose de la porte,</HI> a good student and well sene in the Frenche tong, who had taken vpō him the whole charge of this present boke. Notwithstanding gentle Readers, our good will herein hath not bene wanting, onely wishing for recompence, that it may be agreable to thée. Farewell.</P>

<HEAD>¶To my Lord the Right <HI>reuerend Cardinall of Sens, keper of</HI> the great seales of France: Andrew Theuet wisheth peace and felicitie.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Y good Lorde,</HI> being sufficiently en∣formed, (how greatly) after the moste com∣mendable and no lesse great and paynfull ex∣ercise, to the which it pleased the King to employe and bestowe your prudencie (&amp; for∣casting witt) you take pleasure not onely to reade, but also to see and taaste, some fayre Historie, the which among so many cares, might recreat your spirite and giue it a delectable libertie of his moste graue and carefull businesse. I haue boldened my selfe to present vnto you this my discourse of a lon∣ger farre voyage made into <HI>India America,</HI> o∣therwise by vs named <HI>Fraunce Antartike,</HI> being partly peopled and partly discouered by our Pi∣lotes, a land which at this day may be called <HI>the fourth parte of the vvorlde,</HI> not onely by the withdrawings of our orizons, as by the diuer∣sitie of nature of bests, and temperatnesse of the ayre of the countrey. Also for that none hereto∣fore hath sought it out, supposing al Cosmogra∣phers
<PB REF="6"/>
(yea persuading with themselues) that the world was lymitted in that which the el∣ders to vs had shewed. And although that this worke semeth to me of it selfe to be very litle to be offered before the eyes of your Lordship, not∣withstanding, the greatnesse of your name will extol the basenesse of my worke: seing also that I am assured wel of your wonted clemēcie, ver∣tue, and desire to heare wonderfull things, that easily you will iudge howe that my intention doeth tende to no other ende but onely to make you vnderstand, that I haue no other delyght than to offer vnto you that thing, of the which you may draw and receiue some contentation, and wherein sometimes, you shalbe eased of the great and troublesome affayres which are of∣fered in thys degree and office, that you holde. For there is no mind or spirit be it neuer so con∣stant, but that sometymes is troubled with the quicke dispatch, graue and weighty affaires of a common weale. Therefore it is needefull sometimes to ordayne as the learned Phisition doth to a pacient or sicke body, some chaunge of meates to recreate the appetite of them which by their infirmitie and sicknesse, cannot broke nor taste one kind of meate continually, be it ne∣uer so pleasant.</P>
<P>This therefore is the cause why the ancient Philosophers and others did oftentimes with∣drawe themselues from being wrapped in or charged with the publike affayres. As also the
<PB REF="6"/>
great Orator <HI>Cicero</HI> witnesseth to haue absen∣ted him selfe many tymes from the Senate of <HI>Rome,</HI> (to the great displeasure of the cytizens) for to remayne in his countreyhouse to be de∣lighted in the plesant and Harmonicall melodie of the birdes. Seing then that among oures, as he among the <HI>Romaynes,</HI> for your singular erudition, prudencie, and eloquence, you are as chiefe and principall minister of the triumphant common weale of <HI>Fraunce:</HI> and such a one as describeth <HI>Plato</HI> in his common weale, that is to know, great Lorde, and a louer of vertue and science, therefore it is not without reason to imitate and folow him in this point. Euen so (my good Lorde) as returning all weake and wery of so long a voyage, I was by you first of your grace receiued and welcomed home, which gaue me to vnderstand and know, that you are the singular patron of vertue and of all those, that folowe it also to my iudgement, I thinke I could not direct this my little labour to a bet∣ter than to you, the which if it please you to re∣ceiue so beningly as with a good &amp; affectioned will I do present and direct it, and also to reade and peruse it, you shal find in my opinion wher∣in to recreate your spirites, and to holde me yours for euer. Although that already for many causes I feele my selfe greatly bound and holdē to do most humble and obedient seruice to your lordship: to whom I besech the creator to giue all good lucke and prosperitie.</P>

<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>Onsidering vvith my selfe hovv much the</HI> long experiēce of things, &amp; faithfull obseruation of many countries and nations, also their orders and ma∣ner of lyfe, bringeth or causeth per∣fection to man, although there were no exer∣cise more cōmendable by the which a man may sufficiently decke his spirite with all kinde of Heroicall vertue and science: biside my first &amp; formal Nauigation into the countrey of <HI>Leuant,</HI> in <HI>Grecia,</HI> in <HI>Turkie, Egypte,</HI> and <HI>Arabia,</HI> the which in times paste I haue put to light, I haue againe vnder the protection and sauegard of the great gouernor of the vniuersal worlde, seing it hath pleased him to shew me so much fauor be∣ing left to the discretion and mercy of one of the most vnconstant Elements, &amp; least assured that is among the rest, with small vesselles of wood so fraile that many times there was more hope of death than of life, for to sayle toward the <HI>Pole Antartike,</HI> the which was neuer discouered nor found out by the elders in times past, as it ap∣pereth by the writings of <HI>Ptolomeus</HI> and others, also ours of <HI>Septentrion,</HI> to the <HI>Equinoctiall,</HI> and therefore it was thought to be vnhabited. And we sayled so long that at the laste we came to <HI>India America,</HI> aboute the <HI>Capricorne,</HI> a mayn land of good temperatnesse and inhabited, as we will particularly &amp; more at large hereafter de∣clare, the which I haue taken in hande at the
<PB REF="7"/>
instant request of many great personages, of whō the gestes more than Heroical &amp; high enterprises celebrated by the Histories, cause them to lyue for euer in perpetual honor and immortall glory. What hath prouoked the great Poet <HI>Homer</HI> so vertuously to celebrate in his writings <HI>Vlysses,</HI> but onely his long peregrination and far trauell that he made in diuerse places, with the experiēce of many things aswel by sea as by land after the spoyle of <HI>Troye?</HI> What moued <HI>Virgill</HI> to write so worthily of the <HI>Troyan Aeneas</HI> although that he according to the writing of some Historiogra∣phers had most trayterously betrayed his natiue countrey in to the hands of his enimies, but one∣ly for that he had vertuously resisted the furie of the raging waues, and other inconueniences of the sea, he had sene &amp; endured many sharpe shou∣res, and finally he came into <HI>Italie?</HI> Euen so as the soueraigne creator hath made man of twoo sub∣stāces the one differing or exceding the other, the one elementary &amp; corruptible, the other celestiall; diuine and immortall. Also he hath put al things in his subiectiō, that is contained vnder the scope or circuite of the Firmament, to the ende that he might know asmuch as to him was necessary for to attaine to the soueraigne gift, leauing him ne∣uerthelesse some difficultie &amp; varietie of exercise. Man then although that he be a creature marue∣lously accomplished, yet he is neuerthelesse an in∣strument of vertuous actes, of the which God is the original, so that he may electe such an instru∣mēt as pleaseth him for to execute his plesure, be

it by sea or by land. But it may so chaunce as it is cōmonly sene come to passe, that some vnder this pretexitie make it a custome to abuse the worke∣master by an auarice and an vnsatiable appetite of some particular and temporall appetite, ieo∣parding themselues vndiscretely &amp; as wickedly, (as <HI>Horace</HI> in his epistles doeth manyfestly shew) that he is worthy of prayse, that for the beautifi∣ing and eluminating of his spirite, &amp; in the fauor of the common wealth doth willingly offer and put forth him selfe. This rule or meane <HI>Socrates</HI> the wise Philosopher knew how to practise, and after him <HI>Plato</HI> his disciple, (bothe the which) not onely contented to haue traueled and made voyages into strange countreys for to attaine to the full perfection &amp; knowledge of Philosophie, but also to declare it openly without hope of any reward or recompense. Did not <HI>Cicero</HI> send his sonne <HI>Marke</HI> to <HI>Athens?</HI> partely for to heare <HI>Cra∣tippus,</HI> and of him to lerne Philosophie, and partly also for to lerne the maners and lyuing of the ci∣tisens of <HI>Athens. Lysander</HI> being elected for his magnanimitie &amp; worthinesse gouernor ouer the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> hath so worthily atcheued so many faire enterprises against <HI>Alcibiades,</HI> a man prewe and valiant, and <HI>Antiochus</HI> his Lieutenant on the sea, that what losse or detrimēt so euer did chāce, his heart and manly courage did neuer faile him, but pursued his enimie by sea &amp; by lande, so that in the ende he brought <HI>Athens</HI> to his obedience. <HI>Themistocles,</HI> not lesse experte in the feate of warre thā in Philosophie, for to shew what a feruēt de∣sire
<PB REF="8"/>
he had to ieoparde his lyfe for the libertie of his countrey, persuaded the <HI>Athenians,</HI> that the siluer that was gathered in the mynes the which they were wonte to distribute to the people, was turned and bestowed to furnishe and make ships and galleys against <HI>Xerxes,</HI> who for that he had partly distressed him, and almost put to flight, fal∣ling to appointment after this happie victorie a∣gainst the order of an enimie, made him present with three of the beste Cities of his Empire. What hath caused <HI>Seleucus Nicanor,</HI> the Emperour <HI>Augustus Cesar,</HI> and many Princes and noble men to beare in their pendens and standarts the Dol∣phin and the anker, but onely to giue instruction to al their posteritie, that Nauigation is the first and of al others the most vertuous. Here therfore without any long discourse is an example of na∣uigatiō: as al things the more excellent they are, the more difficile or harde is the way to attaine to them, as after the experience <HI>Aristotle</HI> witnes∣seth, speaking of vertue. And that the nauiga∣tion is alwaies folowed with peril, as a body is with his shadowe, the which in times past was shewed by <HI>Anacharsis</HI> the Philosopher, who af∣ter he had demaūded of what quantitie or thick∣nesse were the plācks or side of a ship: it was an∣swered, not aboue four fingers: so much (said he) is the lyfe of him from death that sayleth with ships on the water. Now gentle Reader in that I haue alleged so many excellent personages, it is not to compare, much lesse to thinke my selfe e∣qual to them, but I am persuaded that the great

power of <HI>Alexander</HI> hath not letted his successors to attempte yea the very extremitie of fortune. Also the deepe knowledge of <HI>Plato</HI> did nothing at all feare or abashe <HI>Aristotle,</HI> but that at his owne pleasure he hath treated of Philosophy. For this intent therefore not to be found ydle and slacke among others, no more than <HI>Diogenes</HI> was amōg the <HI>Athenians,</HI> I haue thought good to set out in writing many notable things that I haue dili∣gently obserued in my Nauigation betwene the South and the Weast, that is to wit, the situa∣tion and disposition of places, in what clymat, zone or paralegie it be, aswel of the sea costes, I∣landes, and mayne land, the temperatnesse of the ayre, the forme and maner of liuing of the inha∣bitants, the forme and propertie of beasts of the earth and of the sea, also of trees and roots with their frutes, mines and precious stones, shewing it liuely and truely as neare as is possible. As touching the reste I wold thinke my selfe happie if that it would please you to accepte and receiue this my little labor with as willing a heart as I doe present it: as for the rest I am assured that it wil be agreable if the Reader thinke well and way in his minde the long and dangerous pere∣grination that I haue taken in hand, for to see with the eye &amp; to bring to light those things most memoriall that I cold note and gather together, as hereafter shalbe sene.</P>

Nowe the first day of Septem∣ber in the foresayde yeare, about sixe of the clocke in the morning, we had sight of one of these Ilands, bicause of the hyght of a great Hill, of the which we wil speke more largely and particularly hereafter. These Ilandes as some do affirme are .x. in number,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The number of these Ilands.</NOTE> of which there are thrée that the Authors make no mention of, for that they are vnhabited, the other seuen, which are named, <HI>Tenerif</HI> the Ile of yron, <HI>Gomeria,</HI> and the great Iland, properly called <HI>Canaria,</HI> are distant from the <HI>Equinoctial</HI> .27. degrées, the other thrée, <HI>Forteuenturia, Palma,</HI> and <HI>Lencelota,</HI> are .28. degrées, so that by this ye may sée, that from the first to the last, is a degrée, the which is .17. Leagues and a halfe, rec∣kening from the North to the South, according to the opinion of Pillotes. But without further talke, he that wold finde out by the degrées of the firmament the quan∣titie of leagues, and stades, that the earth doth contayne, and what proportion there is from league to degrée (the which ought to be obserued of him that will write of coū∣treys as a true Cosmographer) let him reade <HI>Ptolomeus,</HI> the which treateth therof at large in his Cosmography.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca. 3.4.5. &amp; 6.</NOTE> Among these Ilands there is none of them, but the grea∣test that is named <HI>Canaria,</HI> bicause of the multitude of greate Dogs that there are nourished, as <HI>Plinie</HI> sheweth, and many others after him, that say as yet, that <HI>Iuba</HI> bare away twayne.</P>
<P>But nowe they are all named the <HI>Canaries</HI> without a∣ny distinction, for this onely reason before shewed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the for∣tunate Ilandes are now na∣med the Cana∣ries.</NOTE> But in my opinion I thinke they were named <HI>Canaries,</HI> for the abundance of Canes and wild Réedes that growe on the sea brink: as for the Canes or Réedes y<SUP>t</SUP> beare Suger, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> haue planted a great many, since the tyme
<PB REF="16"/>
that they haue there inhabited, but ther did inhabite bru∣tish &amp; Barbarous men before that there were any Dogs, the which standeth by good reason, for I knowe well by experience, that in all the countreis and <HI>Indies</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> haue ben discouered and founde out of late dayes, they had neuer knowledge of dog or catte, as hereafter shal be shewed. Yet I knowe well that the <HI>Portingals</HI> haue brought the∣ther some, and kept them for to hunte after wild beastes. <HI>Plinie,</HI> therefore speaketh in this maner: the first is called <HI>Ombrion,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ombrion.</NOTE> whereas there is no signe of house nor building. In the mountaines there is a fountaine, &amp; trées like vnto that which is named <HI>Ferula,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange trees.</NOTE> both blacke and white, out of the which may be wrong or writhen water. Of the blacke ones the water is very bitter, &amp; to the contrary the white ones, the water is pleasant to drinke. The other is called <HI>Iunonia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iunonia.</NOTE> whereas there is but one onely house builded of stone, ther is sene another that is next to this, but lesse &amp; of the sayd name: another that is full of greate Lizardes. Right ouer against these before shewed, there is another named <HI>the Iland of Snowe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ile of Snowe. Canaria.</NOTE> for that it is alwayes couered with snowe. The next to that is <HI>Canaria,</HI> so called bicause of the multitud of great dogs y<SUP>t</SUP> it engendreth, as we haue before shewed, wherof <HI>Iuba</HI> King of <HI>Mauritania,</HI> had two, &amp; in the saide Ile ther are some apperāce of old buildings. This coūtrey in times past hath ben inhabited with wild &amp; Barbarous people, not knowing God, but altogether Idolaters, worshipping y<SUP>e</SUP> Sūne y<SUP>e</SUP> Moone &amp; certaine other planets, as soueraigne deities, of the which they thought they receiued al their benefits, but in lesse thā .58. yeres, y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Spaniards</HI> haue subdued and ouercome them, and slayne part of them, and the rest they hold and kepe as slaues and captiues: and they inhabiting there, haue established or set vp the Christian fayth, so that at this present ther is none

I do much maruel how the inhabitantes of these Ilands, and of <HI>Afrike,</HI> for that they are néere neighbors, haue so differed in language, in colour, Religion and in maners. Also that many vnder the <HI>Romaine</HI> Empire haue conque∣red and subdued the greatest parte of <HI>Africa,</HI> and neuer touched these Ilands, as they haue done in the sea <HI>Me∣ditareum,</HI> knowing also that they are very fruitfull, ser∣uing as a victualer to y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Spaniards,</HI> euē as <HI>Cicilie</HI> serueth to the <HI>Romaines</HI> and <HI>Geneuois.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The bountie of the Ilandes named Cana∣ries.</NOTE> This countrey of it selfe is good, being so well tilled, it bringeth greate profit, and the most in Sugers.

<PB REF="17"/>
for medicine, to the which vse they did put it &amp; to little o∣ther. But now adayes voluptuousnesse is so incresed, spe∣cially in our <HI>Europe,</HI> that there cannot be neuer so little a banket made after our maner of liuing, but that euery sause must be sugered, and also our meates and drinkes. The which thing was defended to the <HI>Athenians,</HI> by their lawes, as a thing that did effeminate the people: the which the <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> haue folowed by example.</P>
<P>But of a trueth the great Lordes of <HI>Turkie</HI> drinke su∣gered waters, for bicause that wine is defended them by their lawe. As touching the wine that was inuented by the greate Phisition <HI>Hyppocrates,</HI> it was onely permitted to sicke folke and vnable, but at this day it is so common with vs, as it is scarce in other countreys. So much haue we spoken by the way, on the talke of suger, let vs nowe returne to our mater.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fruitful∣nesse of the Canaries.</NOTE> As for corne there is sufficient in these Ilands, also of very good wine, better than the wine of <HI>Candia,</HI> where as they make Malmesies, as we will de∣clare intreating of the Ilands of <HI>Madera.</HI> Of flesh also there is sufficient, as wilde and tame goates, birds of all kindes greate quantitie, Oranges, Citrons, Lemonds, Pomegranads and other fruites, Palmes, and greate quantitie of good Hony.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Smal trees na∣med Paper.</NOTE>There is also about the riuers and floudes little trées named <HI>Paper,</HI> and in the sayd riuers and floudes there are fishes named <HI>Silures,</HI> the which <HI>Paulus Iouius</HI> in his booke of fishes, thinketh to be Sturgion, of the which the poore slaues féede on, sweating for trauell &amp; almost breath∣lesse, and oftentymes they féede thereon for wante of other meate.

haue sene it my selfe. Among other things, there is found an herb against the hils sides commonly called <HI>Oriselia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oriselia an herbe.</NOTE> the which they gather with greate diligēce for to dye co∣lour. Furthermore they make a kinde of blacke gumme the which they name <HI>Bre,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bre, blacke gumme and howe it is made.</NOTE> of the which there is greate abundāce in <HI>Tenerif.</HI> They take thornes of y<SUP>t</SUP> which there is great quantitie, and breake them, and lay them by pece one vpon another like crosses, and vnder eche heape there is a little hole of no great depth, and then they set fire on this woodē almost at the very top, and then it rendereth his gumme that falleth into this hole.

I know well that <HI>Cyrus</HI> King of the <HI>Medians</HI> and <HI>Assirians,</HI> be∣fore that he had conquered <HI>Egypte,</HI> made to be planted a great number of plāts that he caused to be brought from <HI>Siria,</HI> that since brought forth good Wine, but yet they passed not these of <HI>Madera.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wine of Cādia</NOTE> And as for the Wine of <HI>Can∣dia,</HI> though they are very excellent, so that in times paste they haue bene greatly estemed in the <HI>Romaine</HI> bankets, the which haue bene more celebrated than the Wines of <HI>Chios, Metheglyn,</HI> and of <HI>Promentorie of Aruasia,</HI> which for his excellencie and pleasantnesse hath bene called Wine for the Gods. But at this day the Wines of <HI>Ma∣dera,</HI> and of the Ile of <HI>Palme</HI> one of the <HI>Canaries,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wine of the Ile of Palme.</NOTE> hath got the reputation, whereas there groweth white, red &amp; claret with the which they doe trade into <HI>Spaine</HI> and from thēce into other countreys.

<P><HI>Plato</HI> estemed Wine to be a very good nourisher, and very familiar to our bodies, stirring vp or prouoking the

We haue here shewed, that onely the quantitie or super∣fluitie of meates and drinkes hurteth: therefore to my iudgement this Wine is better the second and third yere than the firste, when it hath the heate of the Sunne, the which heate within time consumeth and vadeth, so that then there remayneth but the naturall heate: for being transported from one place to another, the burning heate extinguisheth. Moreouer in these Ilandes of <HI>Madera,</HI> the trées, herbes, and fruites growe so rancke and thick, that they are constrayned to cutte and to burne a greate parte thereof. In stede of which they plante canes of Su∣ger that profit very much, bringing their Suger in, in .6. monthes, and those that they plante in Ianuarie, are cut in Iune, from one moneth to another, and so according as they are planted, the which letteth that the heat of the Sunne doth not hurte them.

And although that in that Countrey the wine is not so good as in other places: and paraduen∣ture for that they haue not bene planted, or so diligently looked too, as it is in many places of <HI>Europe,</HI> neuerthelesse they haue by Diuine prouidence recouered by Arte and some diligēce, that which otherwise to them was denied. Now this Palme is a trée maruellous faire &amp; wel accom∣plished, be it in heighth in perpetuall gréennesse or other∣wise, (of y<SUP>e</SUP> which) there are diuers kinds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diuers kindes of Palmes.</NOTE> &amp; that grow in diuers places. In <HI>Europe</HI> aswell as in <HI>Italy,</HI> these Palmes growe abundantly, chiefly in <HI>Sicily,</HI> but they are barren:
<PB REF="26"/>
in some of the borders of <HI>Spaine,</HI> they beare fruite vnreli∣shed and sowre, not to eate. In <HI>Affrica</HI> they are swéete, and also in <HI>Egipt,</HI> in <HI>Cypris,</HI> in <HI>Creta,</HI> and also in <HI>Arabia.</HI> Likewise in <HI>Iuda:</HI> the wine that therof is made, is excel∣lent, but it hurteth the braine. Of this trée there is male and female, the male beareth his floure at the braunche, the female buddeth without floure. And it is a maruel∣lous thing, and worthy of memory of that which <HI>Plinie</HI> and many others doe resite, that in the Forest of Palme trées that naturally grow out of the earthe, if that the males be cut, the females become baren without bearing any more fruit, as widowes that want their husbandes. This trée requireth a hot Countrey, a sandy ground, and brackishe or salt, otherwise they salte the roote before they plant it. As touching the fruit, it beareth meat outwards, the which groweth first, and within, a nut with a shel, the which is the graine and séede of the trée,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plinie. lib. 13. cap. 4.</NOTE> as we sée Appels in our Countrey: and also there groweth little ones a∣mong these, without nut, growing al on a braunch.

And yet eue∣ry play or game hath his trée, as the Bay trée, the Mirrhe trée, and the Oliue trée, or for that this trée, as some say, was first consecrated to <HI>Phoebus</HI> before the Laurell or Bay, the which of antiquitie hath represented the signe of victorie. And the reason thereof reciteth <HI>Aulus Gelius</HI>▪

when he saith, that this trée hath a certayne propertie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The property of the Palme.</NOTE> that happeneth to worthy and vertuous men, that is, that the Palme trée neuer boweth nor bendeth, but to the cō∣trarie, the more that it is laden the more as by a manner of resistance it redresseth and beareth vpwarde, the which <HI>Aristotle</HI> confirmeth in his Problemes, also <HI>Plutarche, Plinie,</HI> and <HI>Theophrastus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 7.

All things among them are wilde and contemptible sauing onely peace, the which they doe somewhat esteme one to∣warde another. In like case reste, with some excercise, sometimes in laboring the grounde for to saue Ryce: as for corne and Wine there is none, as touching corne it cannot prosper nor come vp as in other countreys for that there falleth very little and seldome rayne, which is the cause that the séedes cannot bud out nor floure bi∣cause of the extreme heate and drieth. So soone as they sée their grounde watered or dewed, they begin to sowe, and after they haue sowed within thrée monethes the fruite is ripe redy to be cut. Their drinke is the Iuice of Palme trées and water.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A fruitfull tree and Oyle of diuers proper∣ties.</NOTE> Among the trées of this countrey there are founde some of the greatnesse of our Oke trées, the which beareth fruite as great as dates: with the nut they make Oyle that hath meruelous properties.

Among these Torterels, there are some of suche a greatnesse, spe∣cially in these partes whereof I speake, that foure men

It is other∣wise sayd that in the night they come out of the Sea se∣king their repast, and after they are full and weary, they fall a sléepe on the water neare to the shore, wheras they are easily taken, for they are heard how they snort in slée∣ping, beside many other wayes and meanes, which were to long to rehearse.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The thicknesse of the shells of these Torterels of the Sea, and why they serue.</P>

To conclude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A historie of a Portingal gen∣tleman.</NOTE> I wil rehearse a Historie of a Gen∣tleman <HI>Portingalls,</HI> that was a Leper, who for the great paine that he receiued of his disease, séeking all the mea∣nes he could to absent himselfe from his Countrey, as one being in extreame dispaire, after he had knowledge of the conquest of these faire Ilands by those of his coun∣trey, was bent for recreation to goe thither, so that he prepared himselfe in the best order he coulde, with ships, men, and artillery, and beastes aliue, specially Goates, of the which they haue quantitie.

<P><PB REF="32"/>Whether that this beast hath any hid propertie against this euill, I leaue to the Phylosophers and Physitions: and so ye may sée that experience hath geuen the know∣ledge of many medicines.

suche a one, that if the elders had had thereof any know∣ledge, they wold haue written it among other things, as∣wel as of the Mountaine of <HI>Vesuue,</HI> and of the hill <HI>Etna,</HI> of the which for a truthe they rehearse maruels. As touching <HI>Etna</HI> in <HI>Sicilie,</HI> it hath cast the fire sometimes with a mer∣uellous noise, as in the time of <HI>Marcus Emilius,</HI> &amp; <HI>T. Fla∣minus,</HI> as writeth <HI>Orosa,</HI> the which many other Historio∣graphers doe affirme, as <HI>Strabo,</HI> the which affirmeth to haue séene it, and diligently considered. The which ma∣keth me to beleue somewhat also in the respecte of these men that haue spoken thereof. Also they are not so farre off, but y<SUP>t</SUP> we may proue whether it be true or no. I know well that some of our writers would say, that one of the Ilandes of <HI>Canaria</HI> casteth continually fire: but let him take héede that he take not that, of which we speake, for the other. <HI>Aristotle</HI> in his boke of maruels, speaketh of an Ilande discouered by the <HI>Carthaginiens</HI> not inhabited, which did cast flames of fire, beside many other wonder∣full things.

There is also an other hill in <HI>Hirland,</HI> named <HI>Hecla,</HI> the which at certaine times casteth stones, as thought they had come out of a fiery furnace, so that the ground within .v. or .vj. leagues about, is barren and vnprofitable, bicause of the ashes that procéede out of this hill, wherwith the ground is couered. This Ilande of which we speake, containeth vij. leagues compasse, by good right called the Ile of fire, for the Mountaine hauing of Circuite .679. paces, and
<PB REF="33"/>
of height a thousand and fiftie fadome or there about, ca∣steth continually fire at the top, the which may be séene thirty or forty leagues on the sea, much more clearer in y<SUP>e</SUP> night than the day, for that by good Philosophy the grea∣test light shadoweth the least: the which maketh the Na∣uigants afraide, that haue no knowledge thereof before. This flame hath a very euill smel, and therfore ye néede not to thinke suche manner of fire straunge, knowing that they are naturall things, as the Phylosophers wit∣nesse, (that is) those places are ful of fire, and hot Mines, of the which procéedeth a vapor hot and dry, like to fire, the which cannot be done without aire. Also from thence procéede waters naturally hot: furthermore in <HI>Esclauonie</HI> by <HI>Apolonia,</HI> there is a fountaine coming out of a rocke, whereas is séene procéede a flame of fire, whereby all the waters adiacent are as boyling.

And so, euen as the burning heate of this hill doth in no wise let the frutefulnesse of the lād, the which bringeth forthe diuers kindes of good fruits, where as is a great temperatnesse of the aire, liuely springes and fair fountaines, also the sea that cōpasseth it, doth not quench this vehement heate, as rehearseth <HI>Plinie</HI> of <HI>Chimera,</HI> al∣wayes burning, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 2. cap. 106.</NOTE> and quencheth with earth or hay, being cast vpon it, but with water it is kindled.</P>

The heat of the aire being so violent, draweth out the natural heat of the heart, and other interior parts, &amp; therfore they remain colde within being destitute of the naturall heate, and onely burned outwarde, as we may sée in other things.

it wil bring them all the day good lucke, be it on lande or on water: neuerthelesse they beleue in God, alleaging y<SUP>t</SUP> he is there aboue immortall, but vnknowne, for that he will not be knowne to them sensibly. The which erroure differeth nothing from the error of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> in times past, that worshipped diuers Gods, vnder the coloure of Images and similitudes. But yet this is a thing worthy to be noted, though it be superstitious and abhominable: that these pore, ignorant, and brutishe men, had rather worship corruptible things, than to be reputed without a God. <HI>Diodorus</HI> the <HI>Sicillian</HI> writeth, that the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> had the first knowledge of the fained gods, to whom they began to vow, and to sacrifice. Also <HI>Homer</HI> signifieth that <HI>Iupiter</HI> with other Gods went into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> as well for that they were there honored and sacrificed vnto, as for the wholesomnesse of the Countrey. The like you haue of <HI>Castor</HI> and <HI>Pollux,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Castor and Pol¦lux, called the bright starres, and lanternes of the sea.</NOTE> the which going on the sea at the re∣quest of the <HI>Greekes</HI> against <HI>Troy,</HI> were vanished in the aire, and were neuer after séene againe, the which giueth opinion to some to thinke y<SUP>t</SUP> they were rauished &amp; placed among the starres of the Sea: also many name them the cleare starres of the sea, attributing their names <HI>Caster</HI> &amp; <HI>Polux,</HI> to two fair &amp; bright starres. The sayd people haue neither temples nor churches, nor other places appoyn∣ted for sacrifice and prayer. Besides this, they are without comparison much more wicked than those of <HI>Barbarie</HI> or <HI>Affrica,</HI> in such sort that the straungers dare not aborde them, nor set foote on land, but by pledges:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The maners and order of liuing of those of Ginney.</NOTE> otherwise they would take them, and handle them like slaues. These Villaines or wicked impes goe all naked, sauing some since the time that their Countrey hathe bene somewhat frequented, haue worne a little shirt of Cotten, or some suche thing, the which is brought them from other places.

They make not so great trade with beastes, as in <HI>Barba∣rie:</HI> there is very fewe fruits, bicause of the drinesse &amp; ex∣treme heat, for this region is vnder y<SUP>e</SUP> signe <HI>Taurus</HI>: they liue a good many yeares, and yet séeme not olde, so that a man of a .C. yeares olde, would be iudged with vs not a∣boue .xl.

They commonly make war with other nations: their weapons are bowes and arows, as the other <HI>Ethio∣pians</HI> and <HI>Affricans.</HI> The women of this Countrey fre∣quent the warre as much as the men, and they beare for the most part, a large buckle of fine gold or other mettal at their eares, lips, and also on their armes.

This people of <HI>Ginney</HI> trade with certaine <HI>Barbariens</HI> adiacent, golde and salt after a straunge fashion. There are certaine places ordained a∣mong them, where as eche one of his parte bringeth his Marchandise, those of <HI>Ginney,</HI> salte, and the others gold molten in lumpes, and without any other talke togither, bicause of the small trust and confidence one of another, as the <HI>Turkes</HI> and <HI>Arabians,</HI> and some of <HI>America</HI> with their neighbors, they leaue in the place before spoken, the golde and the salte of eache part. This being done, these <HI>Ethiopians</HI> of <HI>Ginney</HI> if they finde there golde inough for their salt, they take it away, otherwise they leaue it, and let it lie.

beleue than taste, or to stand disputing thereof.

Furthermore they haue right course, without y<SUP>e</SUP> one of the <HI>Poles</HI> be more ere∣cted than the other: the day &amp; the night are to thē equall, &amp;
<PB REF="38"/>
therefore they were named <HI>Equinoctiall,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">From whence commeth the name Equi∣noctiall.</NOTE> and according as the Sunne doth depart from the one to y<SUP>e</SUP> other <HI>Pole,</HI> there is vnequalities of dayes and nights, and eleuation of the <HI>Pole.</HI> Then the Sunne declining by litle and litle from this point <HI>Equinoctial,</HI> goeth by his <HI>Zodiake</HI> almost to the Tropike of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> and passing no farther, cau∣seth the <HI>Solstice</HI> of winter: then returning, passeth by the sayd <HI>Equinoctiall,</HI> till that he come to the signe of <HI>Cancer,</HI> whereas is the <HI>Solstice</HI> of Sommer: therefore he maketh vj. signes parting from the <HI>Equinoctiall</HI> to eche one of these Tropikes.

Some vnder this line cōparing the coldnesse of the night, with the heate of the day, haue taken this argument: that in that respect there might be good temperatenesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The tempe∣ratenesse of the aire, vnder the Equinocti∣all line.</NOTE> biside many other reasons y<SUP>t</SUP> I omit for this present.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Man hath great desire to knewe and se things.</NOTE>IT is euidently sene howe greate the curiositie of men is, either for a desire to knowe things, or for to attayne to possessions, or else to auoyde Idlenesse, that they haue hazarded them selues (as the wise man sayth, and beside him the Poet <HI>Horace</HI> sayth in his Epistles) to all dan∣gers and trauels, for to eschew pouertie, to leade a more quiet life without trouble or payne. Notwithstanding it might be ynough for them to know and vnderstande that the soueraygne workmaster, hath made with his owne handes this worlde al rounde, so that the water hath ben separated from the lande, to the ende that more commo∣diously euery one might inhabit in his proper Eliment, or at the leaste in that place whereas he thought moste beste. Neuerthelesse not content with this, they would knowe if it be all ouer inbabited. Notwithstanding for such finding out, and diligence, I esteme them for my parte as much and rather more worthy of prayse, than our late writers and Nauigators, for that they haue first opened to vs these things. Otherwise with greate payne we could not haue knowen them nor comprehended: but <HI>Thales,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The opinion of many Phi∣losophers, that say all the world is not inhabited.</NOTE> <HI>Pithagoras, Aristotle,</HI> and many others as well <HI>Greekes</HI> as <HI>Latins</HI> haue sayde, that it is not possible that all partes of the world should be inhabited, the one parte for the greate and vnsuportable heate, another parte for the great and vehemēt cold. Other Authors deuiding the world into two parts called <HI>Himisperes,</HI> (one of y<SUP>e</SUP> which) they say can in no wise be inhabited. But the other parte in the which we are, muste of necessitie be inhabited.
<PB N="30" REF="39"/>
And so of foure partes of the worlde they take away thrée, so that to their opinion there shoulde rest but two, that be habitable. And for the better vnderstanding thereof to eche one, excepting those that haue knowledge thereof, I will declare this more playner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fiue Zones by the which the worlde is measured.</NOTE> minding there∣fore to proue that al the world is inhabited. They suppose that there is fiue zones in all the worlde, by the which they will measure, and compasse all the earth, of the which two are colde, two temperate, and the other hot. And if you wil know how they gather these fiue <HI>Zones,</HI> extende your lefte hande towarde the Sunne rysing, being the fingers spredde abroade, and by this meane <HI>Probus Grammaticus</HI> dyd teach, or instructe. Then when you haue beheld the Sunne, thorough the lower parts of your fingers, bowe and bende them euery one in forme or manner of a Circle. By the thumbe ye shall knowe the colde zone, which is the North,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cold zone.</NOTE> the which by the excessiue coldenesse (as they doe affirme) is vnhabited. Neuer∣thelesse the experience hath shewed within fewe yeares, that all those partes well néere to our <HI>Pole,</HI> also vnder the <HI>Paralezey Artike</HI> ioyning to the <HI>Hyperbores,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The temperat Zone.</NOTE> as <HI>Sca∣uia, Dacea, Swetherlande, Gotlande, Norway, Denemarcke, Thilia, Lyuonia, Pilapea, Pruse lande, Russia, Muscouia, Ruthenie,</HI> whereas there is nothing but Ise, and conti∣nual coldnesse, to benotwithstanding inhabited with fro∣warde and brutish men. The which to our Englishe Marchantes is well ynough knowen. Therefore the An∣cient writers in this do greatly erre, &amp; are not to be bele∣ued, hauing onely spoken by gesse and thought, and not by experience. Let vs speake of the other zones: the o∣ther finger next to the thumbe, doeth signifie the tempe∣perat zone, the which is inhabited, &amp; extendeth to the tro∣picke of <HI>Cancer,</HI> though y<SUP>t</SUP> in drawing néere it be more hot
<PB REF="40"/>
than temperat, as that which is iustly in the midst, that is to know betwene this tropicke &amp; the <HI>Pole.</HI> The thirde finger doeth represent the zone placed betwene the two tropickes named <HI>Torrida,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zone Torida.</NOTE> bicause of the extreme heate of the Sunne, the which resteth and burneth vp all, and therefore it was iudged vnhabitable. The fourth finger is the other zone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another tem∣perat zone.</NOTE> temperated of the <HI>Antipodes,</HI> a meane betwene the tropicke of <HI>Capricorne,</HI> and the other <HI>Pole,</HI> the which is inhabited. The fifth which is the little fin∣ger signifieth the other zone colde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another colde zone.</NOTE> the which in like case they haue estemed vnhabited for the like reason as they alleged for the former <HI>Pole,</HI> of the which we may say as much as we haue sayde of the North parte, for the like reason is of bothe. After then that this rule or example is knowen, it is easily knowen what partes of the Worlde are inhabited, and which are not, according to the opiniō of the Auncient writers. <HI>Plinie,</HI> diminishing that which is inhabited, sayth, that of the fiue partes that are named zones, we muste take away thrée bicause they are not in∣habited, the which hath bene shewed by the thumbe, the greate finger and the little finger. Also he taketh away al that occupieth the Weast sea. And in another place he writeth that y<SUP>e</SUP> earth that is vnder y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Zodiack,</HI> is onely in∣habited. The causes that he allegeth why these thrée zones are vnhabited, is, the vehement colde, which for the farre distance &amp; absence of the Sunne is in y<SUP>e</SUP> Region of the two <HI>Poles,</HI> and the greate and extreme heate that is vnder the zone <HI>Torrida,</HI> is bicause of the continuall presence of the Sunne. As much doe our late Theologiās affirme and write. The contrary notwithstanding, may be shewed by the writings of these Authors before alle∣ged, by the authoritie of Philosophers, specially of our tyme, by the witnessing of holy Scriptures, and then by
<PB N="31" REF="40"/>
experience which passeth all, the which by me hath bene made. <HI>Strabo, Mela,</HI> &amp; <HI>Plinie,</HI> although that they disproue the zones, write neuerthelesse that there are men in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> in the Ilande named by the elders <HI>Aurea,</HI> and also in the Ile <HI>Tabroban, Malaca,</HI> and <HI>Zamotra,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The zone To∣rida and hills Hyperbores are inhabited.</NOTE> vnder the zone <HI>Torrida:</HI> also that <HI>Scandenauia,</HI> the hills <HI>Hyper∣bores,</HI> and the countrey adiacent néere to the North, of the which we haue before shewed, are peopled and inhabited although according to the saying of <HI>Herodita,</HI> these hills are directly vnder the <HI>Pole.</HI> The first that founde out the lande contayned vnder the two temperat zones to be in∣habited, as <HI>Plutarche</HI> writeth, was <HI>Parmenides.</HI></P>
<P>Many haue written that not onely the zone <HI>Torida,</HI> may be inhabited, but also wel peopled. The which <HI>Aue∣roys</HI> proueth by the witnessing of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> in the fourth Chapter of his booke intituled, <HI>of the worlde and of the firmament <HI>Auicen</HI></HI> in the like case, in his second doctrine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The zone To∣rida, more cō∣modious and wholesom thā the others.</NOTE> and <HI>Albertus Magnus,</HI> in his sixte Chapter of the nature of Regions, efforcing to proue by naturall reason, that this zone is inhabited, yea more profitable for our hu∣maine life than those vnder the tropickes. So that by this meanes we will conclude and say that it is better, more commodious, &amp; more wholesome for our humayne life, than any others. For euen as the colde is an enimie, so in like case the heate is friendly to our bodies, knowing that our life is nothing but heat and moysture, to the contrary death is colde and drinesse. By this ther∣fore ye may knewe that all the earth is peopled, and is neuer without dwellers neither for colde, nor heate, but for barennesse, and whereas it is vnfruitfull it may be inhabited, as I haue sene in <HI>Arabia,</HI> and in other coun∣treys. Also man was created of God for that he might dwell and lyue in what parte of the worlde he woulde,
<PB REF="41"/>
were it hote, colde or temperate: for he him selfe sayde to our first parentes: <HI>Growe, increase and multiplie.</HI> The ex∣perience furthermore teacheth, (as many times we haue sayde) howe large the worlde is, and commendable to all creatures, the which we may sée by the continuall Naui∣gations on the sea, and by the long iourneys on the lande.</P>

<HEAD>Of the multitude and diuers kindes of fishes being vnder this lyne Equinoctial. Cap. 20.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore the departing out of our lyne, I thinke it good to declare particularly of the fish that is found about seuen or eight leagues on this side and beyonde the lyne of diuers colours, and such a multitude, that it is not possible to number them, or to heape them together, the which are as a greate heape of corne in a barne. And ye shall note that among these fishes many haue folowed our ships more than thrée hundreth leagues, specially the <HI>Dorades,</HI> of the which we will speake hereafter more at large. The <HI>Marsouins</HI> or sea Hogs, after that they had perceiued our ship from farre, dyd swimme a mayne against vs, the which gaue to the Mariners a certayne signe and forshewing of that parte from whence the winde ought to come, for these Sea beastes (say they) will swimme against one, and in a greate com∣pany as foure or fiue hundreth together. This fish is na∣med <HI>Marsouin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marsouin and why it is so named.</NOTE> of <HI>Marissus,</HI> in Latine, which is as much to say as a sea Hog, bicause that he is like almoste to Hogs on the earth, for he hath the lyke grunt or noyse, and hath the snoute lyke the ende of a Canne, and on
<PB N="32" REF="41"/>
the heade a certayne cundite or opening, by the which he yaunneth or purgeth, euen as the Whale. The Mariners take many of them with certayne gynnes of Iron being sharpe, and pointed at the ende and croked, and they doe eate but little thereof, hauing other better fish: but the liuer and lights is very good &amp; delicate being bothe like, and also in taste to a Hogs harscelet. When they are taken, drawing towarde their death they caste greate sighes as we sée our countrey Hogs do when they are let bloude. The female bringeth but twoo at a tyme. It was therefore a wonderfull thing to sée this greate number of fish making a maruelous greate noyse with∣out comparison, the which some peraduenture wil thinke strange and vncredible: but I will affirme it to be so, for that I sawe it. As I sayd before, that there is fish found of al colours, red, as those whō they named Bonnites, the others Azure, &amp; like golde, shining brighter than fine A∣zure, as those named <HI>Dorades,</HI> others gréene, gray, blacke. Yet I will not say, that out of the sea they shoulde kepe those colours. <HI>Plinie</HI> rehearseth that in <HI>Spaine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A foūtaine that sheweth fish lyke golde.</NOTE> in a fountayne, the fish are of the coloure of golde, but out of the fountayne they are lyke to others, the which may come of the colour of the water, being so betwene our eye and the fishe, euen as a glasse being of a gréene or blewe colour representeth the things that ar within of the same colour. Now to retourn to our <HI>Dorade,</HI> many as wel An∣cients as others haue written of the nature of fishes, but very homelie, for that they haue not sene but hearde say, and specially of the <HI>Dorade,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aristotle and Plinie of the Dorade.</NOTE> <HI>Aristotle</HI> writeth that she hath foure finnes, two aboue and two vnder, and that she maketh her yong ones in sommer, &amp; y<SUP>e</SUP> female remayneth hyd a certaine time, but he telleth not how long. <HI>Plinie</HI> to my iudgement, hath borowed or lerned this of <HI>Aristotle,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 6. cap. 16.</NOTE>
<PB REF="42"/>
speaking of this fishe, saying that she hideth hir self in the sea a certayne time, but in passing further he hath defined this tyme to be when it is extreme hot, for that it cannot endure so greate a heate. There are founde great ones like Samons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The descriptiō of the Dorade.</NOTE> others that are lesser: from the head to the tayle it hath a creste and all that parte coloured lyke fine Azure, in such sorte that it is vnpossible to excogitate or thinke a more fayrer colour: the inferior or lower parte shineth like fire golde and for this cause it was named <HI>Dorade,</HI> also of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> in his lāguage <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that the interpretors call <HI>Aurata,</HI> and it is very fierce on the flying fish, the which she foloweth, and chaseth in the wa∣ter, as the hounde chaseth a haare in the fieldes, for she li∣ueth by pray, casting hir selfe hye aboue water after this flying fish, and if that she fayleth at one time she recoue∣reth at another tyme. This fish folowed our shippes the space of seuen wekes without once forsaking of them, yea night and day, vntill that she founde the sea vnsauery or not for hir nature.

<P>THE twentie sixth day of October, being eight de∣grées beyonde our lyne <HI>Equinoctiall,</HI> we founde an Ilande not inhabited, the which at the firste we thought to name the Ile of Birdes, bicause of the greate multitude of Birdes that are in the sayde Ilande,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ile of the Ascention, an why it was s. named.</NOTE> but looking in our carde <HI>Marin,</HI> we found that before tyme it was founde out by the <HI>Portingals,</HI> and named the Ile of the <HI>Ascention,</HI> bicause that on that day, they ariued thi∣ther. We therefore seing those Birdes flying on the sea,
<PB REF="43"/>
made vs to thinke that there was some Ilande néere hande, and the néerer we came, we sawe such a multi∣tude of birdes of diuers sortes with coloured feathers, that the lyke was neuer séene in our tyme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diuers kinds of strāge birds and in great number.</NOTE> the which came flying to our ships, and woulde reste vpon vs, so that we might take them with our handes, and with greate payne coulde we be ridde of them. For if one had stretched out his Arme they woulde haue rested vpon it, euen lyke tame birdes, and not one of them lyke to the birdes of our countrey, the which to some semeth vn∣credible. Being caste of from our handes they flyed not away, but let them selues be taken agayne as before.</P>
<P>Furthermore in this Ilande there is a certayne kinde of greate birdes that I haue heard called Aponars,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aponars birdes.</NOTE> they haue little wings, and therefore they cannot flye. They are great and hye, lyke hearnshawes, the belly white and and the backe blake as cole, the byll lyke to a cormo∣rant, when they are killed they crye lyke hogs.</P>
<P>I thought good to speake of this birde among others, for that there are founde a greate number of them in an Ilande lying towarde the <HI>Caape,</HI> of good Spéede, on the coste or borders of newe founde lande,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caape of good hast Ile of A∣ponards and why it is so na¦med.</NOTE> the which was named the Ile of <HI>Aponards:</HI> Also there are such a multi∣tude, that on a tyme thrée greate ships of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> going to <HI>Canada,</HI> did lade eche of them two tymes their cock∣boates with these birdes on the brinke of the sayde Ilande, and it is no maistrie to goe into the Iland and to driue them before them to their boates lyke shéepe.

And also the trées bring forthe fruit of themselues without planting, grafting, setting or sow∣ing: neuerthelesse their fruits are as good, swéete and ple∣sant to eate, as if the trée had bene grafted. We sée in our countrey that the fruits of the fields, that is to wit, those that the earth bringeth forthe without laboring, is rude, wilde, soure, swete, and without any good tast, the others are contrary. Therfore in this Iland, is much better fruit than on the maine lande, although that it be vnder one <HI>Zone</HI> and temperatenesse, among the which there is one that they name in their language <HI>Chicorin,</HI> and the Trée that beareth them, is like to a fether trée of <HI>Egipt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chicorin, a fruit that we name nuts of India.</NOTE> or <HI>A∣rabia,</HI> as well in height as in leaues.

<P>Moreouer if any tyme they be clad with any thyn and light shirte, the which they haue peraduenture gotten by greate payne: when they mete with their enimies they put it of before they set hande to their weapon (whose weapons) are a bowe and Arowes, for they thinke y<SUP>t</SUP> this garment or shyrte would take away their dexteritie in their fight, also that they could not easily flye nor remoue their iointes before their enimies: yea they say that they shoulde be taken of their enimies by such garments. And therefore they had rather be naked, so ignorant are they and yll aduised. Neuerthelesse they are very desirous of gownes, shirts, hats, and other clothing, and they esteme them so precious and costly, that they will rather let them

marre &amp; take harme, than once to weare them, least that by that meanes they shuld hurt them. In déede somtimes they will put them on when that they remaine at home, drinking and making good chéere after the death of their parents and friends, or in some solemnity after that they haue obtained victorie of their enimies. Moreouer if that they haue on any garment, they will put it of when that they sit downe on the ground, and caste it on their shoul∣ders for feare of soyling of it. There are olde men &amp; wo∣men among them, that hide their priuie partes with leaues. Some haue said that in <HI>Europe</HI> when it was first inhabited, the men and women went al naked, only their secrete parts couered, as we read of our first parents. Ne∣uerthelesse in that time the men liued longer than they do in our age, being not subiect to so many diseases as we are, so that they haue affirmed that all men ought to goe naked as <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eue</HI> our first parents did, when they were in Paradise.

The elders among thē will kepe their promisse, and are more faithfull than the yong men, &amp; yet they are all subiect to theft, not that they steale one from another, but if they finde a christian or a straunger, they will rifle him (of their golde &amp; siluer they will take none) for they haue not the knowledge nor vse therof, but their garments.

<P>Moreouer they haue this honesty, that the firste that hath taken any great praie, be it on water or lād they wil distribute to euery one specially to Christians, if there be any, and they will request and desire them fréely to eate therof, esteming it a great iniurie if you refuse it.

<HEAD>Against the opinion of those that thinke these wilde men to be all heary. Cap. 31.</HEAD>
<P>FOR bicause that many haue this foolish opinion, that those people, whome we call wilde men, as they

liue in the woods and fields almost like to brute beasts, so in like maner they are beary all ouer their bodyes, as a Lion, a Beare, or such like. Also they are so pictured and painted in their tablets &amp; clothes. To be short, in setting out a wilde man, they set him out al hairy, euen from the head to the foote, the which is altogether false and vntrue. I haue knowne some so obstinate, that they would af∣firme it with an othe, as those that had séene it of a truth. As for me I knowe and affirme the contrary, for that I haue séene it. The wilde men as well of the East <HI>Indies,</HI> as of <HI>America,</HI> come forthe of their mothers wombe as faire and as well pollished as oures of <HI>Europe.</HI> And if that haire grow by succession of time on any parte of their bo∣dies, as it doeth to vs and others in what parte of the bo∣dy so euer it be, they scratche it of with their nailes, sa∣uing only the haire of their heads, so greatly they doe de∣test and abhorre it, as wel women as men. And the hairs that growe on their browes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A kinde of herbe that cut∣teth like steele.</NOTE> the women doe shaue it of with a certaine herbe that cutteth like a raser: this herbe is like to Sage or Iouncke, that groweth by the water side. As touching the hair Amatory, and their beards, they pluck it of, as wel as of the rest of the body. Within these few yeares they haue found the meane to make litle pin∣sers, with the which they pull of their haire, for since that they haue bene frequented of Christians, they haue lear∣ned the way how to forge Iron. And therfore beleue not hereafter the common opinion of y<SUP>e</SUP> painters nor their do∣ings in this poynt, for they haue libertie to paint things to their owne discretion, euen as Poetes haue to forge and inuent lies. If it should chaunce that a childe should come forth of his mothers wombe hairy, &amp; that the hairs should grow &amp; encrease all ouer his body, as the like hath bene séene in <HI>Fraunce,</HI> this were an accident of nature, as

Further more as tou∣ching these <HI>Americanes,</HI> they make their haire grow as Monkes were wont to doe, the which passeth not their eares, they cut their haire of before, for this occasion as I haue bene enformed, for if they should weare their haire long before, and their beard lōg, it shold be occasion that they shold fal into the hāds of their enimies, which wold take them by their haire and by their beard.

The women do more oftner coloure them selues therewith than men. Furthermore ye shall note in this place, that if the men are minded to go ten or twelue leagues off to drink or make good chéere with their friendes, they will pille some kinde of Trée, where within shall be red, yelowe, or some other coloure and they will stampe it very small, and then they wil take gumme out of another trée, the which they name <HI>Ʋsub,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vsub a kinde of Gumme.</NOTE> with the which they wil rub al their body ouer, although it be good for wounds and sores, as I haue séene by expe∣rience, &amp; then vpon this Gumme they wil poure of these coloures before shewed.

It groweth on the trée by clusters, xxx. or .xl. togither, and close to another vpon litle branches neare to the trunck.

Notwithstāding it groweth in a cer∣taine herbe that beareth leafe like to a Palme, as wel in the length as in largenesse, it groweth in the midst of the leaues very round, &amp; within it be litle Nuts, of the which the kernell is white &amp; good to eate, sauing that ouermuch therof, as wel as of other things, hurteth the braine.

<HEAD>Of false Prophetes and Magicians, that are in this countrey of America, the which inuocate and cal vpon wicked spirites, and of a tree named Ahouai. Cap. 36.</HEAD>
<P>THis people being so far from the truthe, beside the persecution that they receiue of wicked spirits, their errours and dreames, yet are they so far out of rea∣son that they worship the deuill, by the meane of some of his mynisters named <HI>Pages,</HI> of the which sorte we haue spoken already.

Such deceiuers for to coloure their wickednesse, and to be estemed honorable among o∣thers, remayne not continually in one place, but they are vacabunds, wandering here and there, through the woodes and other places, and returning with others, at certayne houres, making them beleue that they haue cō∣ferred and counseled with the sprits, for publike affaires, and that they must do so and so, or that this or that shall happen, and then they are receiued and intertayned ho∣norably, being nourished and intertayned for this their doing: and they esteme them selues happie, that may re∣mayne in their fauor and good grace, and giue or offer to them some presente. Likewise if it happen, that any of them haue indignation or quarrell against his neighbor, they come to these <HI>Pages,</HI> to the ende that they mare dye

with poyson him or them to whom they will euil. Among other things they helpe themselues with a trée named in their language <HI>Ahouay,</HI> bearing fruite venomous and mortal, the which is of the greatnesse of a little chestnut, and it is very poyson, specially the nut. The men for a light and little cause will giue thereof to their wiues, be∣ing angred, and the women likewise to the men: likewise these wicked women when they are with childe, if their husbandes haue displeased them, they will take in stede of this fruite a certaine hearbe, for to make their fruit of their wombe to come before their time, this fruite being white with his nut, is made like this greke letter Δ <HI>Del∣ta,</HI> and of this fruit the wild men when the nut or kernel is out, they make bels, and hang them on their legs, the which maketh as a great a noyse as the Moris daunsers in our countrey. The wilde men wil in no wise giue of this fruite to strangers being fresh gathered, likewise they forbid their children in no wise to touch thereof be∣fore that the kernell be fallen away. This trée in heigth is lyke to our peare trées, the leafe of two or thre fingers long, and two fingers broade, being gréene or springing all the yeare long, the barcke is whitishe. When there is a braunche cut thereof, it rendreth a white iuice or ly∣quor almost like milk, the trée being cut it casteth a mar∣uelous stinking smell, therefore the wilde men will put it to no vse, not to make therewith fier woode. I will for∣beare here to set forth the properties of many trées, bea∣ring fruites maruelous faire, neuerthelesse as much and rather more venemous than this trée of which we speke. Furthermore ye must note that the wild men haue these <HI>Pages</HI> in such honor and reuerence, that they worship them or rather do Idolatry to them, specially when they returne from any place: ye shall sée this people goe before

<P>THese people of <HI>America</HI> are greate quarrellers a∣gainst their neighbors, chiefly against those whome they name in their language <HI>Margageas,</HI> &amp; <HI>Thaba∣iares,</HI> &amp; hauing no other meane to appease their quarrell, they fight cruelly one with another: They gather toge∣ther vpon a .6000. men, sometymes ten or .12000. village against village, or otherwise as they do méete, the like do those of <HI>Perou</HI> and the <HI>Canibals.</HI> And before that they exe∣cute any greate enterprise, be it in warre or otherwise, they assemble and come together, chiefly the eldest sorte, without their wiues or children, with such a grace and modesty, that they wil speake one after another, and be that speaketh shal be heard with attētiue silence, who ha∣uing declared his minde, giueth place to another, and so folowing in order, the Auditors sit downe on the earth, vnlesse it be some ancient men, that lye on their beds, the which considering with my selfe, commeth to my remem∣brance the moste commendable custome of the gouernors of <HI>Thebes,</HI> an ancient Citie in <HI>Grecia,</HI> the which for to cō∣sult together of the affaires of the common welth would alwayes sit downe vpon the ground: the which maner of doing is estemed an argument of prudence.

I thinke that if <HI>Theseus,</HI> the first inuenter of peace amōg the <HI>Greekes,</HI> were among them, he shoulde be more trou∣bled, than euer he was: this people haue certaine sleights of warre to trap one another, as well as in other places. Therefore these <HI>Americans</HI> haue perpetuall enimitie one against another at all tymes against their neighbors before shewed, séeking their enimies, and fighting as furi∣ously together as is possible, the which causeth eache vil∣lage to fortifie, &amp; to make themselues strong with people and weapons. They will assemble together on the nights in greate number for to kepe watche and warde. For they are wonte to skirmish togethers, more on nightes than on dayes: if that they haue knowledge therof before hande, or otherwise do suspecte the comming of their eni∣mies, they wil plante in the grounde rounde about their lodgings the compasse of a bowe shot, sharp pointed pins of wood, the which are so set in the earth, that they are scāt perceiued: this kind of policie they vse to gal &amp; pierce the féet of their enimies, which are al bare and naked, as well as the rest of their bodies, to the ende that by this meanes they might intangle their enimies for to kill some, others for to take prisoners. It is a greate honor to them, the which departe out of their countrey, for to as∣sayle their enimies on the borders: and when that they haue taken many of their enimies prisoners in theyr countries, he that hath taken most prisoners, is honored and celebrated among others, as a great King or a great Lorde: when he hath most killed, and when they meane sodainly to assayle a towne or village, they wil hide them selues in the woodes lyke Foxes, lurking there for a cer∣tayne tyme, vntil they haue espied the tyme and vantage to come forth sodainly to beset their enimies. Whē they be come to a village, they know the mene to set fier ther∣on,

for to make them come forth with their wiues &amp; chil∣dren, bag and baggage: being come forth, they assaile one another shoting of their arrowes: also with their Maces &amp; Swords of wood, that to behold them it is a good passe∣time: they wil bite one another w<SUP>t</SUP> their téeth in all places wheras they cā take hold, shewing sometymes the bones of those whome they haue vanquished and ouercome be∣fore times in the warrs, and eaten: to be short, they do y<SUP>e</SUP> worst they c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n to feare &amp; anger their enimies.

The women folow their husbands to the warres, not for to fight as the <HI>Amazoness</HI> doe, but for to minister to their husbands foode and other necessa∣ries, requisite in the warres; for sometymes they make iorneys of fiue or six moneths before they returne: he that is greatest among them, hath moste wiues to serue him. And when they make any greate iorney, they set fire on their houses, and if they haue any good thing, they hide it vnder the ground vntill their returne. Their vittels that they haue is such as the lande beareth, that is, rootes ve∣ry delicate and pleasant to eate, and flesh of wild beastes, and fish dried in the smoke: their beds of cotton are ca∣ried with them: the men beare nothing but bowes and arrowes in their handes: their weapons are also greate Swordes and Clubs of wood very heauy: their bowes are as long as oure bowes in Englande: their ar∣rowes are made pointed, some of Canes that growe on the sea coast, and others are made of a kynde of a woodde named <HI>Hayri,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hairi a tree.</NOTE> bearing leafe lyke to a Palme trée, the whiche is of the coloure of blacke Marble:

A litle before our ariuall those <HI>Americans</HI> that are our friendes, had taken on the sea a little barcke of <HI>Portingals,</HI> being harde by the shore in some place, but what resistence so euer they made aswell with their gunnes as otherwise, neuerthelesse they were taken and the men eaten, sauing a fewe that we ranso∣med, and bought at our ariuall. By this ye may knowe that the wilde men that are resident, where the <HI>Portin∣gals</HI> be, are enimies to the wilde men, that inhabit where the <HI>Frenchmen</HI> ariued. Well to conclude, they fight as well on the water, as on the lande, if it happen at any tyme the sea to rage and to swell, they cast therein Par∣trige fethers, or some other thing, thinking by this means to appease the waues of the sea. In lyke manner doe the <HI>Turkes</HI> and <HI>Moores,</HI> being in the lyke danger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A foolish opi∣nion of the wild men and of the Turkes and Moores.</NOTE> wa∣shing their bodies with the water of the sea.

on the which they hang certaine rounde fruites, or the bones of some beast of fishe made in maner of beads, the which they hang about their prisoners neck. And so ma∣ny Moones as they are minded to kepe him, the like quā∣titie of these Beades will they hang about their neckes, and so take of euery Moone one, vntill that y<SUP>e</SUP> Moones are expired. And some in stead of these Beades, will hang as many litle collers about their necks, as they haue Moo∣nes to liue. Furthermore ye shall note, that these wilde men doe not recken neuer aboue fiue, and they obserue neither dayes nor houres, neither monthes nor yeares, but they count only by Moones. This maner of counting or reckening, was in times past commaunded to be vsed by <HI>Solon</HI> to the <HI>Athenians,</HI> that is to obserue the dayes by the course of the Moone. Nowe to our purpose, if that of this prisoner, and of the wife that is giuen him, there are borne any children for the time that they shalbe togither, they shall be kept and nourished for a time, and than they will eate them: saying, that they are their enimies chil∣dren. This prisonner, after that he hath bene well enter∣tained and made fat, they will put him to death, thinking it to be a great honoure. And for to celebrate this slaugh∣ter, they wil send for their farthest friends and kinsfolks, for to eate their parte thereof: the day before the execu∣tion, he shall be laide in his bed, and chained with Iron, the which vse they haue learned of the Christians, sin∣ging after this sorte: <HI>The <HI>Margageas</HI> our friendes, are good men, strong and mightie in the vvarre, they haue ta∣ken and eatē a good number of our enimies, likewise they vvill eate me vvhen it please them.

smitten downe like an Oxe in the Shambles (after many Ceremonies.)

By this ye may knowe, that the like is done to them, if they be taken in the warre. The prisoner being put to death after this sort, and hewed in pieces, and pre∣pared according to their maner, shall be distributed a∣mong them all, be they neuer so many, euery one a mor∣sell or piece: as for the bowels or inner partes, the wo∣men eate them vp commonly, and they reserue the head to set it on a poll out of their houses in signe of triumph and victorie.

all the day without meate or drinke in his bed. Likewise he shall abstaine certaine dayes, and in thrée dayes after he shal not set foote on groūd. If he be minded to goe to any place, he is borne on mennes shoulders, ha∣uing among them this fonde and foolish opinion, that if he should not so doe, there would happen vnto him some mischiefe, or else the like death. This being done, with a little sawe made of the téethe of a beast named <HI>Agon∣tin,</HI> he will race his skin on his brest, or on other places, so that it shall appear all rent and broken. And the cause why they doe these things, is as I haue bene enformed of some of them, that they doe it for pleasure, estéeming the murther that by him hath bene committed against his enimie, a great glory and honoure to him warde. Vn∣to whome, minding to shewe the crueltie of the thing, disdaining my woords, sayd vnto me, that it was a great shame to vs for to forgiue and pardon our enimies, ha∣uing once taken them in the warres. Moreouer he sayd, that it is muche better to put them to death, to the ende that they moue not warre against vs an other time. By this ye may sée with what discretion these poore brutishe men doe rule and gouerne themselues. Also the maidens doe vse suche Ceremonies with their bodies the space of thrée dayes continually, after that they haue had the first purification of women, so that sometimes they are very sicke.

<HEAD>Hovv that these vvilde men couet greatly to reuenge their harmes and iniuries. Cap. 41.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not greatly to be maruelled at, if that these peo∣ple walking in darknesse, and ignorant of the truthe, prepareth not only vengeaunce, but putteth it in vre: Considering that the Christian, although it be straightly forbidden him by expresse commaundement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vengeance is defended to Christians.</NOTE> cannot kepe himselfe from it, folowing the error of one named <HI>Meli∣cius,</HI> who helde opinion, that we ought not to pardon our enimies, the which error hath of a long time polluted the Countrey of <HI>Egipt.</HI> Therfore to prepare vengeance, is to hate our neighbor, the which is wholly repugnant to the lawe. But in these people it is not straunge, the whiche as we haue before shewed, liueth without faithe &amp; with∣out law. For all their warre procéedeth only of a foolishe opinion of vengeaunce without cause or reason. And thinke not but that this foolish opinion hathe helde them from the beginning, and shall doe vntil the ende, if that God for his mercies sake illuminat not their harts. This pore people are so ill taught, that onely for the flying of a flie, they will prepare mischiefe. If that a thorne pricke them, or a stone hurt them, they will stampe it in a thou∣sande pieces, as if the thing were sensible or had vnder∣standing, the which commeth not but for fault of good iudgement. Furthermore this is of a truthe, the which I am ashamed almost to speake, that for to reuenge them selues of Fleas and Lice, they kill them with their téeth, a thing more brutishe than reasonable. And when they féele them selues offended or gréeued, be it neuer so little an offense, they will neuer be reconciled without
<PB REF="73"/>
vengeaunce. Such opinions are taught, and be obserued from age to age. Ye shall sée them instructe and teache their children being a thrée or foure yeares of age, to handle a Bowe and an Arrowe to learne to shoote: also they exhorte them to manlinesse, to take vengeaunce of their enimies, and not to pardon any, whome so euer it be. Moreouer, when they are prisoners one to another, thinke not that they require to be redeemed by any com∣position what so euer it be, for they hope no other thing than very death, estéeming it an honoure and glory vnto them. And therefore they can very well mocke vs, that deliuer our enimies that we haue in our power, for mo∣ney or suche like things, the which they say, is vnwor∣thy to a man of warre. As for us say they, we vse no such things. Vpon a time it chaunced that a <HI>Portingall</HI> being prisoner to these wilde men, thought by faire words to haue saued his life, so he began to preache to them by faire woordes as gentle and as lowly as might be. Ne∣uerthelesse his flattering woords could not preuaile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A history of a Portingall, be∣ing prisoner to the wildemen.</NOTE> but he to whome he was prisoner, shotte him to death with his arrowes: Goe thy wayes saide he, thou haste not merited to die honourably as others, neither yet among companie.</P>
<P>On a time there was brought a yonge male childe of these wilde men of <HI>America,</HI> of the Countrey and lig∣nage of those whome they name <HI>Tabiares,</HI> which are mortall enimies to those wilde men, with whome the Frenche men are in concorde and peace by certain Mar∣chauntes of <HI>Normandie,</HI> the which was afterwarde baptised, norished and maried at <HI>Roan,</HI> liuing like a Chri∣stian man. But he was minded to returne into his coun∣trey with vs, being of the age of two and twenty yeares.
<PB N="64" REF="73"/>
It came to passe that being there, he was discouered of his auncient enimies, by the meanes of certaine Chri∣stians, who incontinently as madde Dogs furious and woodde, ran to our shippes which were at that time de∣stitute of men, where as by casuall chaunce they found him, so they fell vpon him, and rent him in pieces, not touching any other of the company there present, who by the prouidence of God, enduring this pitifull death, exhorted them in the Christian faith, so this poore man died among their handes a good Christian man, whome they did not eate, as they did other of their enimies. What opinion of vengeaunce is more contrary to our lawe? Notwithstanding, there is found among vs ma∣ny, so obstinate that they will reuenge as well as the wilde men. Furthermore, this is among them, if one smite an other, let him be assured to receiue as muche a∣gaine, and rather more, for they will not leaue it vnpu∣nished: it is a faire sight to sée them quarrell and sight together. As for the rest, they are faithfull one to an o∣ther,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The faithful∣nesse of the wilde men, but not to Christi∣ans.</NOTE> but to Christians the most affectioned and subtel∣lest théeues, although they be naked, that are possible, and they estéeme it a great vertue, that they may steale any thing from vs. This I speake, for that I haue pro∣ued it my selfe, for being there about Christmasse time, came a king of the Countrey to sée the <HI>Sieur</HI> of <HI>Ʋillegag∣non.</HI> They of his company did steale away my apparell being sicke.

<P>THis honorable estate of Matrimonie, sheweth that we haue brought some naturall reason from oure mothers wombe. Otherwise we should be counted as brute beasts, if that God of his mercy did not illumi∣nate our heartes. Therefore ye may be well assured, that these <HI>Americanes</HI> are no more discrete in their maria∣ges, than in other things. They mary one with another, cousins with cousins, the vnkle with the néece, but not the sister and the brother. A man, the more worthy and valiant he is estéemed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they of America do marry.</NOTE> the more wiues is permitted to serue him, and to the other lesse: and for to say the truth, the women trauail more than do the men, that is to wit, to gather rootes, make meale, drinkes, gather together the fruites, dresse gardens, and other things that apper∣taineth to housholde. The man only goeth sometimes a fishing, or to the woodes to take Venison for their suste∣naunce. Others occupy themselues to make bowes &amp; ar∣rowes, leauing the rest for their wiues to doe. They will giue you a maid to minister vnto you necessaries whilest you be there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The deflou∣ring of maids, before they be maried.</NOTE> or otherwise if ye will, and it shalbe lawfull for you to restore hir againe when you thinke méete, and this they vse customably.

But for to auoide this, the <HI>Sieur</HI> of <HI>Ʋille∣gagnon</HI> at our arriuall defended vpon paine of death, not to acquaint our selues with them, as a thing not lawfull for Christians.</P>

Further∣more, they haue neuer companie with their wyues in the day time but onely the nightes, neither in publike places, as many in our countrey thinke they haue, as the <HI>Cryb,</HI> a people of <HI>Thracia,</HI> and other barbarous men in certaine Ilands of the sea <HI>Magilanike,</HI> a thing very detestable and vnworthie of christendome, to whome may serue for example these poore brutishe men. The women for the tyme that they be greate with childe, shall not beare or carie any heauie burthens, neyther shall do any great labour for feare to be hurt. The wo∣man being brought to bed or deliuered, the wiues shal carie the chyld to the sea to be washed, or to some Ry∣uer, and then will bring it to the mother, who shall re∣maine in hir childe bed twentie dayes, and foure hou∣res, the father shall cutte the childes nauell with his téeth, as I my selfe haue séene: as for the rest, they han∣dle and vse the women in child bed, as tenderly as we doe here: the norishment of the litle childe is the mo∣thers milke, notwithstāding that within certain days after his natiuitie, they wil giue it grosser sustenance. The father shortly after the childe is borne, shall giue him a bow and arrow in his hand, as a beginnyng and

protestation of warre and vengeaunce of their eni∣mies. But yet there is one thing that marreth al, that is, that the fathers &amp; mothers before they marry their daughters, wil gyue them to be abused, to the first cō∣mer for a little value, principally to Christians, that trade thither, if they will couple with them, as wée haue before shewed. Wée fynde in some histories of certaine people, lyuing in maner as these wilde men do in their mariages. <HI>Seneca</HI> in one of his Epistles, and <HI>Strabo</HI> in hys Cosmographie writeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The auncient custome of the Lydians Arme¦nians, and the inhabitants of Cypris.</NOTE> that the <HI>Lydians</HI> and <HI>Armenians</HI> hadde a custome to sende their virgins and maidens to the sea borders, there in offering them selues to all commers to get them husbandes, or else their dowries. As muche sayeth <HI>Iustinus,</HI> dyd the vir∣gins of <HI>Cypris,</HI> for to get their dowries and mariages, which when they were quit and well iustified, offered to the Goddesse <HI>Venus,</HI> a present or offeryng. We may fynde at this day amongst vs, that making great pro∣fession of vertue and religion would doe the lyke, and rather more, without offering presente or candle, the which I knowe of a truthe. As touching the consangui∣nitie in Mariage, Saincte <HI>Hierome</HI> writeth, that the <HI>Athenians</HI> were woonte to marrie the brethren wyth the systers, and not the Auntes wyth the nephewes, the whych is contrary to the order of the <HI>Americanes.</HI> Lykewise in oure countrey a woman of late hadde li∣bertie to marrie hir selfe to fiue husbandes, and not contraried. Beside this we sée the <HI>Turkes</HI> and <HI>Arabi∣ans</HI> tooke many wiues: I speake it not for that it is ho∣nest and allowable, but for that we christians should auoyde such things. To conclude, our wylde men vse the maner and order that wée haue shewed, so that a mayden is seldome maried, hauing hir virginitie, but beyng once maryed, they dare doe no faulte: for their
<PB N="66" REF="75"/>
husbandes doe looke straightly to them, hauing a sus∣pition of Iealousie: shée may leaue hir husbande if that she be euill intreated, the whiche oftentimes commeth to passe, as we reade of the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> that dydde the lyke before they had any lawes. In this pluralitie of women that they vse, as wée haue sayde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The wyld mē haue many wiues.</NOTE> there is al∣wayes one aboue the others, moste fauoured, whiche is not subiect to so much trauell as the others. All the children that procéede by the mariage of these wiues, are reputed legittimate, saying, that the first Author of generation, is the father and not the mother, which is the cause that many tymes they kill the male chil∣dren of their enimies being prisoners, bicause y<SUP>e</SUP> such children in time to come might be their enimies.</P>

<P>SEyng that I haue shewed you their doing and ma∣ner of liuyng, and other theyr orders and ceremo∣nies, there resteth to speake of their Funerals and burialls. For all that these kinde of people are bru∣tishe and vnciuile, yet haue they this custome and opinion to lay the dead bodies in the earth, after that the soule is separated from the body, in the place wher as the deceased in hys life time toke most plesure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The maner of the wilde men to burye the dead.</NOTE> thin¦king so as they say, that they can not put hym in place more notable than in the earth that bringeth forth the men, that beareth so many fruites, and other richesse profitable and necessarie for the vse of man. There haue ben many lewde and vnaduised Heathen Philo∣sophers, that toke no care what should becom of their bodies after their decease, whether it were cast out to y<SUP>e</SUP> beasts in the fields or birds of y<SUP>e</SUP> aire, they forced not:
<PB REF="76"/>
As <HI>Diogenes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The opinion of Diogenes for the buriall of the bodie.</NOTE> who after his death, cōmaunded that this body should be cast out to the foules of the aire, &amp; bea∣stes of the fielde for to be eaten and deuoured, saying that after his death, his bodie should fele no more pain, and that he loued much better that his body shold serue for sustenance than to putrifie and rot. Likewise <HI>Ly∣curgus,</HI> among the <HI>Lacedemonians,</HI> did giue straight cō∣maundement, as <HI>Seneca</HI> writeth, that after his deathe his body shoulde be cast into the sea, others that there should be burned to ashes. These poore people of <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> though they be brutish and ignorant, shewe them selues after the death of their parentes or frends, with out comparison more reasonable, than aunciently dyd the <HI>Parthians,</HI> who for all that they had lawes, in stede of putting their dead bodies into the earthe, cast them out to be a praie for soules and dogs. Also the <HI>Taxili∣ans,</HI> did cast their dead bodies to the soules of the ayre, and the <HI>Caspians</HI> in like maner. The <HI>Ethiopians</HI> did cast the dead bodies into the waters: the <HI>Romans</HI> did burne them to ashes, as many other nations haue done. By this ye may sée, that the wilde men are not so voide of honestie, but that they haue some knowledge of good, considering that without lawe or faith they haue this knowledge and aduise, that is to wit, as much as Na∣ture hath taught them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The funeralles of the deade is approued by holy scripture.</NOTE> Therfore they burye the deade bodies in the earth, as we haue alreadie sayde, in like maner as did aunciently the <HI>Nasomones.</HI> Nowe the bu∣riall of the dead is approued as well by the olde, as by the new testament: Likewise the ceremonies if they be duly obserued, as well for that they haue bene ves∣sels and instrumēts of the soule diuine and immortal, as also to giue hope of the resurrection to come.

Euery lodgyng hathe fayre coueryngs, but they are so low, that one muste stoupe to goe in, as he wold do at a wicket, in euery one there is many roomes, and euery one for hym selfe and his familie, thrée fadome of length.

Nowe therefore these wylde men in these little houses, are many houshol∣des together, in the middest of which theyr beddes ar hanged euery one in his quarter vnto pyllers mighty strong and square, the which beds are made of good Cotton woll: for thereof they haue greate plentye, the whiche a trée beareth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trees that beare cotton.</NOTE> béeyng of the height of a man lyke vnto greate Buttons, or Akornes: but

And for that all dis∣eases (as oure Phisitians shewe vs) come or happen either of the aire, or of the maner of mens liuing, I am determined to write and set out here a sicknesse or disease verie rife and common in these countreys of <HI>America,</HI> and of the West, discouered in our time.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pians a sicke∣nesse in Ame∣rica, and his oirginall.</NOTE> Now this sickenesse named <HI>pians,</HI> by the people of the countrey, cōmeth not of the corruption of the aire, for it is there verie good &amp; tēperat, which sheweth by expe∣ence,

the fruites that the earth bringeth forth, with the benefite of the aire, without y<SUP>e</SUP> which nothing is made, bee it of Nature or artificiall. Also that the sycknesse procéedyng of the corruption of the ayre, hurteth as aswell the yong as the olde, the ryche as well as the poore, notwithstandyng the internall or inwarde dis∣position.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The wildmen are very leche∣rous and car∣nall.</NOTE> Therefore it muste néedes bée, that it procée∣deth of some misgouernement, as to much carnall and fleshely frequentation the man with the woman, con∣sidering that thys people is very lecherous, carnal, and more than brutishe, specially the women: for they do seeke and practise all the meanes to moue man to lust.

Thus much thought I needefull to speake in this place. And he that will make any difficultie to beleue my words, let him aske the opinion of the moste lear∣nedest Physitions of the originall &amp; cause of this dis∣ease, and what internall partes are soonest grieued, where it is nourished. For I sée at this day many con∣tradictions (but not among the lerned.) And to my sée∣ming, I fynde very fewe that toucheth the pricke, spe∣cially of those that take vpon them to heale it: among the which, there are men and women so ignorant, that they cause many mishaps vnto the poore pacientes: for in stéede of curyng and healyng of them, they make them worse and worse.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The wilde mē are afflicted with ophthal∣mies, and from whence they proceede.</NOTE> There are other kinde of dis∣eases, as <HI>ophthalmies,</HI> of the whiche we haue alreadie shewed, that comes of ouermuch smoke, for that they make their fires in many corners and places of their lodgings, the which are great, for that they assemble a great number; for to take vp their lodgings.

Moreouer, this kind of people is always subiect to the leprosie, paralysey, and other exterior vices as we are in this country, but they are alwayes whole and well disposed, walkyng with a great courage and boldnesse, their heads lifting vp like a stagge or hart.

<P>THere is none be they neuer of so rude and grosse memorie, but that knoweth well, that these <HI>A∣mericanes</HI> are made of foure elementes, as all na∣turall bodies are, so that by this meanes they are sub∣iect to the like affections that wée are.

the sea, are subiecte to rotten diseases, as Feuers, Catarres, and others. In the whiche these poore peo∣ple are so persuaded and abused of their Prophetes, of whome we haue spoken, the whiche are called for to heale them when they haue these diseases: and they haue this foolishe opinion, that they can cure them:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The foolishe opinion of the wilde men in their prophets and of their diseases.</NOTE> we can not better compare these impes, thā to a companie of new fond foolish &amp; ignorant Physitions in our dayes here in our realme y<SUP>t</SUP> persuade the pore people, &amp; make profession that they can heale all kinde of diseases cu∣rable and vncurable, the whiche I woulde very well beleue, if that science were become ignorance. Ther∣fore these Prophetes make them to beleue, that they doe speake vnto the spirites and soules of their paren∣tes, and that nothyng to them is vnpossible, also that they can cause the soule to speake within the bodie. Moreouer, when soeuer any sycke man féeleth his sto∣macke to swelle by the occasions of some humours in the stomacke and liuer, the whyche by debilitie or o∣therwyse he can not caste or vomite vp, he thinketh that it is his soule that complaineth. Now these goodly Phrophetes for to heale this disease wil suck with their mouth the place where the sore or disease lieth, thin∣king that by this meanes they drawe it oute. Lyke∣wyse they sucke one an other, but not with such belefe and opinion: the women vse other meanes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A methode meane to heal the disease ob¦serued of these wylde men.</NOTE> they wyll put into the pacientes mouth a thréede of cotton a two foote long, the whiche afterwardes they sucke, thyn∣kyng also by thys thréede for to get away thys disease or sickenesse.

<PB REF="82"/>
the which they thinke is contrary: They haue y<SUP>e</SUP> mean to lette bloud betwéene the shoulders, with a kynde of herbe very cutting, or with the teeth of some beast. The maner how to diet the pacient is this:<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the paci∣ent liueth whē he is sicke.</NOTE> They wil neuer giue him no meate nor sustenance before he doe aske it, and they will rather let him languish a whole moneth. They are not so often grieued with sicknesse as we be, although they go all naked day and nyghte: also they vse no excesse or superfluitie in their meates or drinkes. In other things they are very curious to knowe the trées and fruites, they will not tast of any fruite that is perisht, vnlesse it be thorough ripe: The fruite of which they commonly eate in their sicknesses is named <HI>Naua,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Naua, an ex∣cellent fruite.</NOTE> being great, made in maner of a Pine apple, thys fruite when it waxeth ripe, becommeth ye∣low, the which is very excellent, as wel for his swete∣nesse as his relish, as pleasant as fine suger and more: It is not possible to bring of them into this countrey, but conserued, for being ripe they will not long kéepe. Furthermore, it beareth no grain, wherfore they plāt them by litle slippes, as the fruites that are grafted in our countrey: Also before it be ripe, it is so roughe in eating, that it will pull of the skinne of your lips: the leafe of this trée when it groweth, is like to the leafe of a large Iounck or sags. I wil not forget, that amōg their diseases they haue one maruellous indisposition, which commeth by litle wormes that enter into their féete,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tom, a kinde of wormes.</NOTE> named in their language <HI>Tom,</HI> that are litle ones and I thinke that they ingender in their féet: for there will be somtimes such a number in one place, that they wyll rayse a knob as big as a beane, with doloure and paine in that place, the whiche paine also chaunced to vs: for being there, our féete and our handes were co∣uered
<PB N="73" REF="82"/>
with little clothes, in the which when they were broken, was onely one white worme with filthe.

Also sometimes they anoynt therewithall their bodies when they be weary. Bisides this, the oyle is proper for woundes and sores, as they haue knowne by experience.

The others that

dwel on the sea coast, where as the Christians to trafike receiue certain hatchets, kniues, daggers, swordes, and other iron tooles, beades of glasse, combes, loking glasses, and other little trifles of small value, which they trucke with their neighbors, hauing no other mean sauing on∣ly to giue one marchandise for an other, and they vse af∣ter this maner: giue me that, and I will giue thée this, without any further talk. On the sea coast, the most fre∣quented Marchandise, is the fethers of a birde, that is named in their language <HI>Toucan,</HI> the properties of which I wil describe, séeing it commeth to purpose. This birde is of the greatnesse of a Pigeon: there is an other kinde like to a Pie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The descripti∣on of Toucan, a bird of Ame∣rica.</NOTE> of like fethers that the other haue, that is to wit, bothe twaine blacke, sauing that about the taile, there are some red fethers among the blacke. Vnder the brest, the fethers are yellow about foure fingers broade, as well in bredth as in lengthe, and it is not possible to finde yellow more excellent, nor finer coloure than is the fethers of this birde: at the ende of the taile, there are lit∣tle fethers as redde as bloud. The wilde men take the skin of that parte that is yellow, and they vse it to make garnishings of swordes after their maner, and certaine garments, hattes, and other things.</P>

they stande in great feare. Moreouer this birde liueth with no other thing among the wooddes, where he ma∣keth his residence, but with certaine fruites that the Countrey doeth bring forthe: some might thinke that this were a water birde, the which is not so, for that I haue séene the contrary.

<P>This also is of a truthe, that before the vse of money, they traded after this sorte ware for ware, so that the wealth and richesse of men, yea of Kings, Princes, and Magistrates, did consist in beastes, shepe, goates and Ca∣mels, of the which ye haue examples in <HI>Berosus</HI> and <HI>Dio∣dorus,</HI> the which shewe vs by wrytings, the maner and vse that the elders before vs vsed to trade one with ano∣ther, the which vse I finde to differ very little from the <HI>Americanes</HI> order, and other barbarous people.

This birde excée∣deth not the greatnesse of a Crowe, and his fethers from the belly to the throte, is as yellow as fine gold: y<SUP>e</SUP> wings and the taile, which are very long, are of the coloure of fine Azure. To the likenesse of this bird, there is another founde of his greatnesse, but differing in coloure, for in stead of hauing the brest fethers yellow, this hathe them as red as pure scarlet coloure, and the rest Azure. These birds are a kinde of Parats, and of like forme as well in head and bil, as in féete. The wilde men of the Countrey sell them déere, for that thrée or foure times a yeare, they plucke their fethers for to make hats, garnishe bucklers, swordes of woodde, and other things requisite, the which they doe commonly. The saide birdes are so priuie, that all the day they will sit vpon the trées, rounde about the wilde mennes lodgings. And when the night commeth, these birdes withdrawe them, some into the houses, and
<PB REF="85"/>
some into the Woodes, but they faile not to retourne the next morowe, euen as our priuie or tame Doues or Pigeons, that will neastle in houses. They haue diuers other kindes of Popengayes differing in Fe∣thers the one from the other. There is one kinde more gréener than those that are brought into oure Coun∣trey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aiouroub a greene birde.</NOTE> the which they name <HI>Aiouroub,</HI> others hauing on their heades blewe fethers, others all gréene, the which the wilde men doe name <HI>Marganas:</HI> there are none found gray as in <HI>Ginney,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marganas.</NOTE> and in high <HI>Affrica.</HI> The <HI>Americanes</HI> kéepe all these birdes in their lod∣gings, but they are not taught to speake, as they are with vs, I meane being made priuie when they are yong, according to the custome of our elders, as <HI>Plinie</HI> sheweth in the tenth booke of his naturall Hi∣storie speaking of birds, where he affirmeth that <HI>Stra∣bo</HI> was the first that put birds into Cages, the which before had libertie to goe and come.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who it was that first caged birdes.</NOTE> The women in like maner nourishe some, the which they sette suche store by, that they call them their friends. Further∣more our <HI>Americanes</HI> doe learne these birdes in their language to aske for meale made of rootes. But they teache them most commonly to say and profer, that they must goe a warfare against their enimies, for to take them, and for to eate them, and other things. They will for no good giue them fruite to eate, nei∣ther great nor little,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great plenty of Popengayes in America.</NOTE> for they say that it engendreth a worme that pierceth their heart. There is a multi∣tude of other Popengayes that are in the wooddes, of the which they kill a great many with their arowes for to eate, and they make their nests in the toppes of trées, for feare of stinging beastes.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="85"/>The time hathe bene, that these birdes were not knowne to the auncient <HI>Romaines,</HI> and other Coun∣treis of <HI>Europe,</HI> but euen since as some doe witnesse, that <HI>Alexander</HI> the great, sent his lieuetenaunt <HI>Onesecriteus</HI> into the Iland of <HI>Tabroba,</HI> who brought from thence a certaine number, and since they multiplied so wel, as well in the East countrey as in <HI>Italie,</HI> and chiefly at <HI>Rome,</HI> as <HI>Columella</HI> sayeth in his thirde booke, of the sayings of the elders, that <HI>Marcus Portius Cato,</HI> (of whome the life and Doctrine was an example to all <HI>Rome</HI>), as he felte him selfe slaundered, sayd on a day to the Senate.</P>

<HEAD>Of Veneson and wilde beastes that these wilde men take Cap. 49.</HEAD>
<P>I Thinke it necessarie gentle Reader, séeing that I haue treated of strange Foules, somewhat to speke as tou∣ching the wilde beastes that are founde in the woodes, and hills of <HI>America,</HI> and also to shewe how the inhabi∣tantes of the countrey take them for their nourishment. I remember that I haue sayde in some place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Americās take wilde beastes.</NOTE> that they nourish no domesticall beasts, but there are in the woodes greate quantitie of wilde beastes, as Hartes, Hyndes, wilde Bores and others. When these beastes straye a∣broade to séeke their liuing, they will make a déepe hole couered ouer with leaues, in the place where the beaste doth most frequent, the which is made so cunningly that with greate payne shall he escape. And they wil take him aliue or kill him in that hole sometymes with their ar∣rowes. The wilde Bore semeth to me more dangerous, he is altogether lyke to the wilde Bores in <HI>Fraunce,</HI> but more fiercer and more dangerous, and hath the tooth more longer and more apparant: he is altogether blacke and without tayle, moreouer he beareth a vent on his backe lyke to a sworde fish.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The wilde Bore of Ame∣rica.</NOTE> This wilde Bore will make a fearful noyse, also ye shal here his téeth make a noise to¦gether when he is féeding or otherwise: the wilde men on a tyme brought vs one bounde, the which notwithstan∣ding escaped in our presence: the Harte and the Hinde

haue not their beare so smoth and euen, as with vs, but more rougher and longer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Harte of America.</NOTE> the Hartes haue their hornes more shorte than oures, the wilde men set much by these hornes, for bicause that after they haue pierced their chil∣drens lippe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The property of a Harts horn</NOTE> they put most commonly into the hole a piece of Hartes horne for to increase it, thinking that therein is no poyson nor danger, but to the contrarie, it letteth and kepeth that at that place of the lyppe there will en∣gender no euill. <HI>Plinie</HI> sheweth that a Hartes horne, is a remedie against poyson. Also Phisitions put thereof a∣mong Medicins that are cordiall, as a comforte to the stomacke, as Iuorie and others: the smoke of this horne burned hath power to driue awaye Serpentes. Some will say, that the Harte hath euery yeare newe hornes, and casteth hir olde ones, and when he is without his hornes, he hideth himselfe. The elders haue taken it for an yll signe for a man, to méete a Deare, or a Hare, but we thinke the contrarie: also the same superstition is foolish and repugnant to our Religion. The <HI>Turkes</HI> and <HI>Arabians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A fond opiniō of the wilde men.</NOTE> are at this day in that error. To this pur∣pose: if our wilde men take an opinion he thinketh it true and it shalbe harde to perswade them the contrarie, the which is, hauing taken a Buck or a Doe, they dare not beare it into their houses, before that they haue cut of the haunches and the legs behinde, thinking that if they shoulde beare it with the foure quarters, it woulde take from them and from their children the meane to take their enimies in running, beside many other foolish opinions, whereof their head is ful. They haue no other assurance thereof, but that their greate <HI>Charaibe</HI> shewed them so, as their <HI>Pages</HI> and false Seductors doe affirme.

euery housholde, that inhabite vnder one roufe alto∣gether, as schollers in colledges, they will neuer eate the flesh of no rauening beaste, or that doeth féede on vn∣cleane things, be he neuer so priuie, but they will not force to kepe priuie such a beaste, as one which they name <HI>Coary,</HI> as greate as a Foxe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The descriptiō of Coary a strange beaste.</NOTE> hauing the moosell a foote long, blacke like a Molle, and little lyke the moosell of a Ratte, hir heare rough, a sclender tayle lyke to the tayle of a wilde Cat, spotted white and blacke, hauing eares lyke a Foxe. This is a raue∣nous beaste, and lyueth of praye or spoyle, about the water side.

she hath no tayle, but a very little one of a finger length, the which is without haire, &amp; of such beasts without tayle there are found a great nūber, she hath clouen féete, with a very long horne almost as much before as behinde, his beare is browne colour lyke some Mules and Oxen in our countrey. And for this cause the Christians that are there, name such beastes Kine, not differing much from Kine, sauing onely she wanteth hornes: and truely to my séeming it is as lyke an Asse as a Cow.

<P>GOing on a day vnto a village distant from the place whereas was our remayning a ten leagues, being in my company fiue wilde men, and a Christian to interpret, I was myndefull to beholde on all sides the ttées, of the which there were diuers sortes, among the which I stayed to beholde that of the which I minde to speake,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The descriptiō of a tree na∣med Vhebeha∣son.</NOTE> the which to sée to, woulde be iudged to be an ar∣tificiall woorke, and not of nature.

knowen of <HI>Solon,</HI> did permit that they might transport al kinde of fruit out of the citie of <HI>Athens</HI> and many other victuals, except honey.

Now to returne to our former trée, it is greatly frequented of these flies or honey bées, although that the fruite is not good to eate as many others are in that countrey, for bicause that it com∣meth not to his ripenesse, but is eaten of these honey bées as farre as I can perceiue.

Now these wilde men haue another meane, almost vncredible to get fire, greatly differing from our vse, that smite a flynt stone with an Yron. And ye must note, that they vse customably fire for their necessities as we doe, &amp; rather more, for to resist the wicked spirit that tormenteth them, for thē which cause they neuer lye downe in what place so euer they be, but that they haue first fire lighted by their beds side. And therefore aswell in their houses or other where, be it in the forest or in the fieldes, whereas they are constrained to remaine a long time, as when they go a warfare or hunte for Venison, they beare commonly with them their instrumentes to make fire. Therefore they will take two stickes vn∣equal, the one which is the least shalbe a two foote long or thereaboute, made of a certaine drie wood, hauing a rinde or pith, the other somewhat more longer. He that will make fire, will lay the lesser sticke downe on y<SUP>e</SUP> ground pierced through y<SUP>e</SUP> middest, y<SUP>e</SUP> which he holding with his féete, wil put the ende of the other sticke in∣to the hole that is in the other, with a littell cotton and dried leaues, then with turning of the stick, there engendreth such a heate, that the leaues and cotton begin to burne, so that by this meanes they light fire, the which in their language they name <HI>Thata,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thata.

They which first discouered this countrey, tooke one of them finely, being twelue foote long, who was so vneasie to holde, that <HI>.25.</HI> men had inough to doe about him, and for to kepe him it behoued them to bynde his féete and hands in their shippe, notwithstanding they could not kepe him long aliue, but for sorow &amp; thought (as they saye) he died for hunger. This Region is of lyke tem∣peratnesse as <HI>Canada</HI> and other countries néere to our <HI>Pole,</HI> and therefore the inhabitants are clothed with the skynne of a certaine beast named in their speach <HI>Su,</HI> which is as much to say, as Water, for bicause (to my iudgement) that this beast for the most part re∣maineth in the waters and flouds. This beast is a ra∣uenous beast, made after a straunge maner: besides this if she be chased or pursued, as the people of the countrey vse to doe, for to haue the skinne, she taketh hir yong ones on hir backe, and couering them with hir tayle that is thick and long, saueth hir selfe with running. Neuerthelesse the wild men of the countrey vse a policie for to take this beast, making a déepe pit in the grounde néere to the place where she maketh hir most residence, the which they couer ouer with gréene leaues, so that in running knowing not of this pit, the poore beaste falleth in with hir yong ones: and she seing hir selfe thus taken, in hir rage she kylleth

hir yong ones, and maketh such a terrible noyse, that she maketh the wylde men afrayde. But for all this, in the ende, they kill hir with darts and arrowes, and then they take hir skinne. Now to our purpose.

And after he had sailed the space of fiue dayes from the east right to the West on the Ocean, the which in swelling or flowing, caried them without sayle right to the South, the which made them ioyful &amp; glad, although the most part of their men were dead by the incōmodities of the sea &amp; the aire, but chiefly by hunger &amp; thirst. In this straight are many fair Ilands, but not inhabited, the country about is very baren: ful of hilles and mountaines, and there is founde nothing but rauishyng beastes, birdes of diuers kindes, chiefly Estriges, woodde of diuers sorts, Cedres, and others. Also an other kynde of trée bearing fruite almoste like a cherie, but muche more pleasant to eate.

Their maner to make this sustenaunce or meate is this: they bruse these roo∣tes either drie or gréene, with a large barke of a trée, garnished aboute with very harde stones: this beyng done, they make it hot in some vessell of earth on the fire with a certaine quantitie of water, so that it ga∣thereth into small lumpes, and it is very good when it is thus vsed, and a good nourisher.

<P>WHilest that I haue pen in hande for to write of places discouered and inhabited beyonde our <HI>Equinoctiall,</HI> betwene the South and the West, for to bring things to light, and to giue more euident knowledge, I am determined to set out in writing a vo∣yage as farre, as difficile and hard and most dangerously aduentured of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as wel by water as by lande vnto the Territorie of the peaceable sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The seapacifick or peaceable or the sea of Ma∣gellan.</NOTE> otherwise called <HI>Mare Magellan,</HI> or the sea of <HI>Magellan,</HI> wheras are the Ilandes of <HI>Moluques</HI> and others.

<P>Moreouer this Riuer is dangerous all a long, for that it is peopled as wel in the Ilandes as on the banckes, with many strange and Barbarous people, the whiche of a long tyme haue had enimitie and hatred to <HI>Spanyardes,</HI> and others strangers, fearing leaste they shoulde aborde theyr countrey, and spoyle them. Also if that by misfor∣tune they get any, they kill them without remission. And eate them rosted and boyled, as they doe other flesh.</P>
<P>Therefore taking ship in one of these Ilandes of <HI>Perou,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ilād of the Holy Crosse.</NOTE> named the <HI>Holy Crosse,</HI> in the greate Sea, for to get the straight of this floode or Ryuer, with a fayre winde they set of, coasting néere ynough to the lande, for to vew and knowe the countrey, the people, and for many other commodities.

The which they hauing done, about a handgunne shot from the lande, there re∣sted no other thing, but with flattering signes, and

other meanes to winne the fauor of the wild men, for to get some vittails, and space to reste their weary bones. So that some of the wild men being in their little boates made of the barcke of trées, being allured with these fayr shewes, did ieopard themselues to approch, not with∣out some doubt, hauing neuer sene Christiā come so néere to their limites.

And after y<SUP>t</SUP> they had made vnto them presentes of small value, this wilde people went with al diligence to purchase and get them some vittails, so at length they brought them great plenty of fish, fruits of maruelous excellencie according as y<SUP>e</SUP> coūtrey brought forth. Among other things one of these wild men hauing bene the day before in skirmishe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The stature of these wild mē.</NOTE> had taken foure of his enimies <HI>Canibals,</HI> and presented to them two members rosted, the which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> refused.

Others there are as greate as Wezels, that the wild mē eate not, for bicause that when they are dead, they stinke like carion, the which I haue sene: also there are founde diuersitie of Serpentes named <HI>Gerara,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gerara a kinde of Serpent.

Therefore it is not to be marueled at, how these wild men there aboutes eate these Rats without daunger, and Serpents euen as they do Lezardes, as before we haue shewed. Likewise néere to this Ilande is founde a kynde of fish, and also v∣pon the coaste of <HI>America</HI> very daungerous, also much feared and redoubted of the wilde men, for that she is a rauening fish, and as daungerous as a Lyon or a Woulfe famished: this fish is named <HI>Houperou,</HI> in their language, and eateth other fish in the water, excepting one that is as greate as a little Carpe,

<HEAD>Of the departing of our Equator or Equi∣noctiall. Cap. 69.</HEAD>
<P>I Thinke there is no man of Spirite, but that knoweth that the <HI>Equinoctiall</HI> is a trace or circle, imagined by the midst of the Worlde, from the East to the Weast, in equall distance of two, so that from the fayde <HI>Equino∣ctiall</HI> to eche one of the Poles, it is .90. Degrées, as we haue at large treated before, and of the temperatnesse of the ayre, that is there about, of the Sea and of the fishes. There resteth nowe somewhat to speake in our returne, of that which before we left out, passing therefore about the firste day of Aprill with a fauourable winde kéeping our right course with sayle spread right to the North,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Au∣thor departed from Thequi∣noctiall.</NOTE> ne∣uerthelesse we were molested with one ill commoditie, the which was, that daye and night it ceased not to raine, the which notwithstanding came well to passe for vs to drinke, considering our necessitie, for the space of two monethes and a halfe, enduring thyrst for that we colde get no fresh water.</P>
<P>And God knoweth whether we drancke not our fill euē with open throte, considering the extreame heat that burned vs: it is true that the rayne water in those parres are corrupted for the infection of the ayre, from whence it commeth: for that whereof the rayne engendreth, is de∣praued in such sort, that if a body wash their hāds there∣with, there wil ryse pushes &amp; bladders.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Certayne rayne water corrup∣ted.</NOTE> I knowe well that many Philosophers hold opinion, that some rayne water is vnholsome, &amp; they set difference betwene these waters, with y<SUP>e</SUP> reasons which at this time I wil not allege auoy∣ding prolixitie: wel what corruptiō so euer came of it, yet neuerthelesse it behoued vs to drink therof though it had

cost vs our liues. Furthermore this water falling on a clothe woulde stayne it and leaue a spot that scant would be gotten out. Nowe therefore after we had passed the lyne, it was néedfull for our conduct, to beginne to counte our degrees, from thence vnto our <HI>Europe:</HI> as much muste be done of them that goe thither, after that they are come vnder the sayde-line. The Ancient Cosmographers, mea∣sured the earth the which we may also doe, by stades, pa∣ces, and féete, and not by degrées as we doe, as affirmeth <HI>Plinie, Strabo</HI> and others, but <HI>Ptolome</HI> did since inuente degrées, for to measure bothe the Sea and the land, which before was not a lyke measured, and this is much more easy. It is then <HI>Ptolome</HI> that hath compassed the whole worlde by Degrées, as wel in length as in bredth, finding 360. Leagues, and in euery degrée .17. Leagues &amp; a half, as I vnderstande of our Pilots, that are expert in Naui∣gation. So that the whole world hauing the Firmament and the Elementes in his conference, contayneth .360. de∣grées equally by twelue signes, whereof euery one hath 30.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The diuision of a degree.</NOTE> degrées, for .12. tymes .30. make iust .360. A degrée con∣tayneth .60. minutes, a minut .60. thirdes, a thirde .60. fourthes, a fourth .60. fifthes, vnto .60. tenthes. For the proportions of the firmament, may be parted in so many partes, as we haue sayde. Then by the degrées we find the longitude, latitude and distance of places, the latitude from the line to our <HI>Pole,</HI> whereas there is .90. degrées, and so much beyonde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How ye may know the lati∣tude longitude and distance of places.</NOTE> the longitude is taken from the fortunate Ilands to the Easte. Wherefore I saye to con∣clude, that the Pilot that woulde sayle, ought to consider thre things, the firste in what hight of degrées, he findeth himselfe, and in what hight the place is that he will goe to, secondly the place where he findeth himselfe, and the place whether he hopeth to goe, that is to know, what di∣stance

and length there is from one coaste to another. Thirdly to knowe what winde or windes wil serue for Nauigation, all the whiche he may knowe and sée by his compasse and other Instrumentes of the Sea. Folowing alwayes our course sixe degrées at this side our lyne, kée∣ping the <HI>Caape</HI> on the North of vs vntill the .15. day of A∣prill, at which tyme we knewe the Sunne to be directly vnder our Zenith, the which was not without enduring great heat as ye may wel thinke, if ye consider the heat y<SUP>t</SUP> is hetherwarde the Sunne, being in <HI>Cancer,</HI> whiche is far from our Zenith to vs that inhabit in <HI>Europe.</HI> Nowe afore going any farther, I wil speake of certayne flying fishes, that I left out when I spake of fishes vnder the lyne. It is therefore to be noted, that vnder the lyne ten degrées on this side, and beyonde there is founde aboun∣dance of flying fish, that flyeth hye in the ayre, being folo∣wed of another fish that woulde deuoure him. So that by the quantitie of him that flyeth, ye may easily conie∣cture the quantitie of the other lyuing by praye. Among the which the <HI>Dorade</HI> (of whom we haue before shewed) doeth folowe hym aboue all others, for that his flesh is very delicate and tender: of the which also there are two kinds, the one is lyke a herring, the which is, that which is so chased of others, this fish hath foure wings, two great ones, lyke vnto the wings of a bat, and two other little ones néere to the tayle: the other is made lyke a Lampron, of the which kindes there are fewe found, but onely .15. degrées on this side, and beyonde the lyne, the which to my iudgement is the cause that those that haue set out bookes of fishes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pirauena.</NOTE> haue left them out beside many o∣thers. The <HI>Americans</HI> name this fish <HI>Pirauena</HI> he flieth lyke a Partrige, and the little one flyeth much better and higher than the other, and sometymes they are so néere

chased and folowed, specially by night, that many tymes they strike againste the ship sayles by heapes, and there remayne. There is another fish, which is called by them <HI>Albacore,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Albacore a fish</NOTE> much more greater than the Porpas, the which is also a deuourer of the flying fish as wel as the <HI>Dorade,</HI> and he is very good and excellent to eate aboue all other fishes in the sea, as well of the Weast as of the Easte. He is vneasy to be gotten, and therefore they make a coun∣terfet fish of white linnen, the which they make to spring aboue water, as doeth the flying fish, and by this meanes he is most commonly taken.</P>

both sydes, before that this Iland was discouered of y<SUP>t</SUP> Christiās, it was inhabited with wilde men that were Idolaters, worshipping the diuel, who shewed him self to them in diuers similitudes &amp; lykenesse. Also they made many &amp; sundry Idols, according to the visions &amp; sights that they had, as they do at this present in many Ilands &amp; maine land of that countrey: the others wor∣ship many gods, chiefly one aboue the rest, the which they esteme to be a maker of all things: and they re∣presēt his figure in an Idoll of wood, being set in some trée garnished with leaues and fethers. Likewise they worship the Sunne &amp; the Moone, &amp; other celestiall cre∣atures, the which now the inhabitāts that are there do not vse, for that they are reformed to y<SUP>t</SUP> Christian faith and to all kynde of ciuilitie: I know wel that in times paste there haue ben some y<SUP>t</SUP> haue not regarded it.</P>
<P>We reade of <HI>Caius Caligula,</HI> an Emperor of <HI>Rome,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">C.

But before y<SUP>t</SUP> this Iland of which we speake, was brought to sub∣iection vnder the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> (as I haue ben enformed of those that were at the conquest) the wylde men killed aboue ten thousād Christians, vntil y<SUP>t</SUP> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had fortified thē selues in certain places: after which time they killed a great multitude of y<SUP>e</SUP> inhabitants, y<SUP>e</SUP> rest y<SUP>t</SUP> were left they led captiue into diuers countreys, and made them slaues.

and faire woordes, always keping them in their fauor, vntill that in proces of time they saw how that they were able to mate and ouercome them, then they began to reuolte from their former vse, taking this rude people and vsing them lyke slaues, they prouoked them to labor the earth, otherwise they had neuer come to the perfection of their enterprise. The mightiest kings of this countrey, are in <HI>Casco,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Casco, &amp; Apina rich &amp; plenti∣full Ilands.</NOTE> and <HI>Apina,</HI> rich and famous Ilands, aswell for the Golde and Siluer that there is founde, as for the fruitfulnesse of the land. The inhabitāts weare nothing but Golde about them, as large bouckles of two or thrée pound waight y<SUP>e</SUP> péece, hanging at their eares, the weight whereof maketh their eares to hang halfe a foote long, the which causeth the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> to cal them greate eares. This Iland is very rich in Mynes of Golde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fruitful∣nesse of this Iland named Noua Espania.</NOTE> as are ma∣ny others of that countrey, for there are founde few or none but either hath Mynes of Gold or Siluer. Further∣more, it doeth abounde with horned beastes, as Oxen, Kyne, Shéepe, Goates and an infinit number of Hogs, also very fayre Horses, the which beastes for the most parte are become wylde as we haue shewed of the maine lande. As touching Corne and wyne they haue none but that which is brought from other places, and therefore in stede of bread, they eate much <HI>Cassade,</HI> made of the meale of Rootes, and in sted of wyne, they haue very good and swéete drynks made of diuerse fruites, as the Syder of <HI>Normandy.</HI> They haue an infinit number of good fish, of the which some are very straunge, among the which there is one named <HI>Manaty,</HI> the which is taken in the ryuers, and also in the Sea, but the greatest store are in Ryuers. This fish is lyke to a Bucke or Goats skynne, being fylled wyth oyle or wine, hauing two féete on both sydes of the shoulders, with the which he swimmeth, and
<PB N="116" REF="125"/>
from the brest to the tayle deminisheth of greatnesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of Manati a strange fish.</NOTE> his head is lyke to the head of an Oxe, hauing a slender face, the chyn ful &amp; great, and very lyttle eyes: this fish is ten foote broade &amp; twenty foote long, hauing a graye skynne, heary lyke to an Oxe hyde, so that with his skynne the people of the coūtrey make showes accor∣ding to their maner: his féete are all rounde, garnished eche one with foure long clawes lyke to the féete of an Oliphant. This fish is more disformed and mishapen, than any kynde of fish in that countrey. Notwithstan∣ding very good to eate, hauing a tast more lyke to vele, than fishe. The inhabitans of that countrey do gather the grease of the sayde fishe, for that it is very good for their Goate skyns of the which they make very good marokyns: the black slaues or <HI>Neigers,</HI> do anoynt their bodies there with to make them better disposed &amp; their ioynts to be playable, as the <HI>Africans</HI> doe with oyle of Olyue. Within the head of this fish are found certaine stones, of the which they make great store,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stones good for the colyke.</NOTE> for y<SUP>t</SUP> they haue proued them to be good against the colyke, be it in the Raynes or in the bladder. The femals of this fish bring forth their yong ones quick, with out egge, as doth y<SUP>e</SUP> Whale &amp; the Grampyn, also she hath .ij. rothers lyke beasts on y<SUP>e</SUP> earth, with y<SUP>e</SUP> which they giue suck to their yong ones. A <HI>Spaniard</HI> that had dwelled long time in this Iland shewed to me, y<SUP>t</SUP> a gouerner of y<SUP>e</SUP> coūtrey did norish one in a cesterne, y<SUP>e</SUP> terme of .30. yeares, the which in proces of time became so priuie, y<SUP>t</SUP> she wold al∣most suffer one to lay his hand vpō hir.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diuers fayre workes made by the wylde men with fe∣thers.</NOTE> The wyld men will take this fish hard by y<SUP>e</SUP> shore as she féedeth vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> grasse.

trim them vpon some lynnen clothe, &amp; therewith they garnish hats, caps and gounes, the which is very fayre &amp; pleasant to beholde. Of strange foure footed beastes there are none founde, but onely those of which we haue spoken. Neuerthelesse there is founde two kynde of lyttle beastes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hulias and Ca¦ris a kinde of strange beasts.</NOTE> as little as Coneys, the which they name <HI>Hulias,</HI> and <HI>Caris,</HI> good to eate. That which I haue sayde of this Iland, I may in lyke maner speake of the Iland of <HI>S. Iames</HI> before named <HI>Iamaica,</HI> on the east side it hath y<SUP>e</SUP> Iland of <HI>S.

This Ilande from the East to y<SUP>e</SUP> west containeth aboute .52. leagues, of length .300. degrées no minutes, and of latitude .18. degrées no my∣nutes. To be short, there are many other Ilandes in those parts, the which bicause of the multitude I omit. Also for that I could haue no particular knowledge of them, I will not here forget, that in all these Ilandes there are founde no rauening beastes no more than in England, and in the Ile of <HI>Creta.</HI></P>

This Iland is more grea∣ter &amp; larger than the others, for it is reckned from the <HI>Promontarie</HI> that is on the East syde, to the other that
<PB N="117" REF="126"/>
is on the west syde thrée hundreth leagues. And from the North to the South seuenty leagues. As touching the disposition of the aire, there it is temperate, so that there is no excesse of heate, nor yet of colde. There are found rich mines of Gold &amp; siluer, likewise other met∣tals. On y<SUP>e</SUP> sea side are found faire riuers that procede from the high hills, the waters whereof are excellent, with great quantitie of good fish. Moreouer before it was discouered, it was better peopled with wyld men than any others, but at this day the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are lords and masters. The myddest of this Ilande hath two hūdreth nintie degrées of longitude, no minuts, and of latitude twenty degrées no minutes. There is a hyll harde by the Sea syde that is all salte,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A salte hill. Salt of the Earth.</NOTE> more higher than that of <HI>Cipris,</HI> greate number of trées of cotton, brasyll, hornebeame, also salte of the earth proceding out of a nother mountaine very high and brackishe. And of this kynde there is founde in lyke maner in the Iland of <HI>Cipris,</HI> named of the Grekes, <HI>Oryctos,</HI> the which also is gotten in a mountaine hard by the Sea.

First there is a valley that is in length thrée leagues betwene two mountaines, where as are founde an in∣finite number of bowles of stone, great and little, be∣ing naturally engendred in that place, although some

The inhabitans at this daye, which before were cruel and vnhumaine, by succession of time haue so well changed their maners and conditions, that in stead of barbarous and cruell, they are ciuill and gratious, in such sort that they haue left all theyr former naughtie and wicked doings, the which they were wont to vse: as in killing one another, eating humayne fleshe, to haue company with the first woman y<SUP>t</SUP> they met, with∣out hauing regarde either to kindred or degrée, with other lyke vices and imperfections.

As touching hayle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hayle rife in Canada.</NOTE> it is not to be maruell though it be rife bicause of the vntemperatnesse and vnconstancie of the ayre, being very colde in this Region, bicause of the distāce of the Sunne, the which commeth no néerer than when it commeth to our Tropicke.

Of the skin of this fish which is strōg and thick, as if it were of some wild beasts, they make clokes &amp; garments according to their maner, which is a meruel∣lous thing, that in a element so moist as that is, which is moist of it self, cā be norished a beast or fish, that hath the
<PB N="134" REF="143"/>
skin hard and dry, as beasts of the earth haue. Likewise they haue other fishes that haue hard skins, as y<SUP>e</SUP> Gram∣pas &amp; the Dog fish and others with strong shels, as Tor∣terels, Oysters, Muscles, &amp; suche like. Besides this, they haue great plenty of other good fish bothe smal and great, of which they liue daily. I maruell that the <HI>Iewes, Turkes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The superstiti∣on of diuers nations in Le∣uant.</NOTE> <HI>Grekes,</HI> &amp; many other natiōs in the East eat no Dolphins nor of many other kinde of fishes, that are without shell, as wel in the sea as in fresh waters, which maketh me to iudge that these people are more wiser &amp; better aduised to finde the tast in meats more delicate, than wheras are <HI>Turks, Arabians,</HI> and other superstitious people. In those parts there is also found Whales, (I meane in y<SUP>e</SUP> hie sea, for such fish neuer cometh toward the shore) to liue with such little fish. Notwithstanding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">With what fish the Whale li∣ueth.</NOTE> the fish that the Whale doth most commonly eate, is no greater than a Carpe, a thing almost vncredible considering hir greatnesse, the reason therof as some say, is for bicause y<SUP>t</SUP> the whale hath but a litle throte in cōparison of y<SUP>e</SUP> greatnesse of his body, &amp; therfore he cannot deuour a greater fish. The which is a wonderfull secrete, &amp; vnknowne as well to our elders as to vs, although that they haue treated of fishes, the fe∣male hath but one yōg one at a time, which she bringeth forth as a beast of y<SUP>e</SUP> earth without egge, &amp; that which is more wōderful, she giueth suck to hir yōg one after y<SUP>t</SUP> she hath brought it forth. And therfore she hath .ij. rothers vn¦der hir belly vnder y<SUP>e</SUP> nauel, which no other fish hath, nei∣ther in the sea nor in fresh water, but only y<SUP>e</SUP> sea Wolfe, as witnesseth <HI>Plinie.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plinie sheweth that a Whale is dangerous on the sea to mete.</NOTE> This whale is dangerous to méete on the sea, as the <HI>Bayones</HI> cā wel tel by experiēce, for they vse to take them. To the purpose, ye shall note when that we wer in <HI>America,</HI> some Marchantes ship y<SUP>t</SUP> passed from one lād to another for marchādise was ouerthrown, &amp; all y<SUP>t</SUP> was within hir lost by a whale y<SUP>t</SUP> touched hir w<SUP>t</SUP> hir tail.
<PB REF="144"/>
In the same place wheras the Whale frequenteth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A fishe that is perpetuall eni∣mie to the Whale.</NOTE> there is found moste commonly a fishe that is his mortall eni∣mie, so that if she méete the Whale, she will pricke the whale vnder the belly, which is the softest and tenderest place, with hir tong that cutteth like a Barbars raser, so that he being thus hurt, cannot saue himself, but that he dieth as the inhabitants of New found land do shew, and the common fisher men. In this Sea of Newe found land, there is a kinde of fishe that the people of the coun∣trey call <HI>Hehec,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hehec a fishe.</NOTE> hauing a bil like a Popengay, and other fishes with shell. There is found in the same place great store of Dolphins, that shewe themselues many times a∣boue water, leaping and floting; the which some iudge to be foreshewings of tempests and fowle weather, from the part or coast that they come from,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foreshewings of tempests. Isidorus.</NOTE> as <HI>Plinie</HI> sheweth, &amp; <HI>Isidorus</HI> in his <HI>Etymologies,</HI> which I haue also knowne by experience, the which is more surer than the witnes∣sing either of <HI>Plinie</HI> or of any other. Some haue written that there is fine kindes of signes and forthe wings of tē∣pests and stormes on the Sea, as <HI>Polybius</HI> being with <HI>Scipio Aemilian</HI> in <HI>Affrica.</HI> Furthermore, there are great plenty of great muscles: and as for beastes of the earth, there are a great number very wilde and daunge∣rous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Straūge beasts.</NOTE> as great Beares, the which are almost all white, and bisides beastes, there are foules of the aire, of which the fethers are all white, the which I thinke happeneth bicause of the extréeme coldnesse of the Countrey: but these Beares which I spake of, are day and night about the houses of this people, for to deuoure their Oyle and Fishe. As touching these Beares, although that we haue treated thereof at large in our <HI>Cosmographie</HI> of <HI>Leuant,</HI> yet notwithstanding we will speake somewhat thereof by the way, howe the inhabitants of the Countrey take
<PB N="135" REF="144"/>
them, being afflicted with y<SUP>e</SUP> importunitie that they make them. Therfore they make certaine pittes in the ground very déepe, néere to trees and rockes, and then they couer them finely with leaues and braunches, and this they vse where as are hiues or multitude of Hony Bées, which these Beares séeke and follow with all diligence, &amp; there∣of they are very desirous, not only so much for to fil them therewith, but for to heale their eyes, the whiche they haue naturally blemished and all their braine: also that being stinged with these Hony Bées, there falleth from them a bloud, specially from the head, wherby their paine is eased, so that they are comforted thereby. There is al∣so séene a kinde of great beastes like to Buffles, hauing hornes very great, their skin is grayishe, of which they make garments, and of many other beasts, whose skins are very riche. This Countrey is full of hils and moun∣taines, and very barraine, as well for bicause of the vn∣temperatenesse of the aire, as of the condition of y<SUP>e</SUP> lande smally inhabited, and ill tilled. As for birds, there are not found suche quantitie as in <HI>America,</HI> or at <HI>Perou,</HI> nor yet so faire. There are two kinde of Egles, of which the one kinde kéepeth the waters, and liueth onely with fishe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two kindes of Egles.</NOTE> chiefly with shell fishe, the which she taketh vp, and flieth into the aire, and so letteth it fall, and breaketh it, for to get the fishe out: this Egle maketh hir nest in great hie trées by the sea side. Also in this Countrey there is many faire riuers, and a multitude of good fishe. This people prepareth for nothing, but that which is néedefull to su∣staine nature, so that they are not curious in meates, for they goe not to séeke any thing in farre Countreys, and yet their nourishment is healthsome, and therefore they know not what sicknesse meanes, but they liue in peace and in continuall health, so that they haue no occasion
<PB REF="145"/>
to conceiue enuie one against an other, bicause of their goods and patrimonie: for they are in a maner all equall in goodes and riches, being in one mutuall contentation and equalnesse in pouerty. Also they haue no place ordai∣ned for to minister iustice, for bicause that among them, they do nothing worthy of reprehension. They haue no lawes no more than the worthy <HI>Americanes</HI> &amp; other peo∣ple, but only the law of nature. The people that dwell to∣ward the sea as I haue shewed liue with fish, and others that are farre from the sea, are content with fruits of the earth that commeth forth, the most part without labour of mannes hands: and after this sorte liued the people in the first age as <HI>Plinie</HI> witnesseth:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>In his .xvj. boke of his naturall history.</P>
<P>Virgill Forest∣of Dodona.</P></NOTE> also we sée in our dayes how the earth bringeth forth fruit without labor. <HI>Virgill</HI> sheweth that the Forest <HI>Dodana</HI> began to die bicause of his age, or else for bicause that it could not satisfie the multitude of people that then did multiply, and therefore they began to labor and till the earth, for to receiue the fruits therof for the sustainmēt of their liues, so that they began husbādry.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Howe the men of Newe found land do warre.</NOTE> Moreouer these people make not warre vnlesse that their enimies come to séeke them, &amp; then they put them al to defence like to the <HI>Canadians,</HI> their instru∣ments that giue men corage to fight, are beastes skinnes spread in maner of a circle, which serueth them in steade of drummes, with fluites of bones of Déere like to the <HI>Canadians,</HI> if that they perceiue their enimies a farre of, they will prepare to fight with their armors and weapōs which are bowes and arrowes. And before y<SUP>t</SUP> they enter into battell, their principall guide the which they honour as a King, shal goe the first, being armed with faire skins and fethers, sitting on the shoulders of two mighty men, to the ende that euery one should sée him, and know him also to be ready to obey him, what so euer he shall com∣maund.

<HEAD>Of the Ilands of Essores. Cap. 83.</HEAD>
<P>THere resteth now nothing of all our voyage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ilandes of Essores why it is so named &amp; feared of the Nauigantes.</NOTE> but to speake of certain Ilands that they call <HI>Essores,</HI> which we coasted on the right hand, not without great dā∣ger of shipwracke. For .iij. or .iiij. degrées beyond, and on this side there bloweth alwayes a winde so cold &amp; conta∣gious, that for this respect it is feared of the Pilots &amp; Na∣uigants, as the most dangerous place that is in the voy∣age, be it to goe either to the <HI>Indies</HI> or to <HI>America:</HI> by this ye may know y<SUP>t</SUP> the Sea in those parts are neuer calme, but alwayes rough &amp; growne, as we sée many times the winde to blow vp the dust into the aire, the which we cal a tempest or fowle weather, which is as well vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> land as on the sea, for in the one and the other, it riseth like a poynt of fire that raiseth the water of a heigthe when it plaweth or boileth, as I haue many times sene. And ther¦fore it séemeth that the wind hath a mouing vpward like a whirle wind of which I haue spoken in an other place. For this cause these Ilands wer so named, bicause of the great <HI>Essor</HI> that causeth this winde in the said Ilands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Essores.</NOTE> for <HI>Essores</HI> is as much to say, to dry or to wipe cleane. These Ilands are distant from <HI>Fraunce,</HI> about .x. degrées and a halfe, and they are .ix. in nūber, of which the best of them are inhabited with Christians <HI>Portingalles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The fruitful∣nesse of the I∣lāds of Essores.</NOTE> whether as they did send many slaues for to laboure the ground, the which by their great paine and diligence they haue made
<PB REF="146"/>
fruitfull with all good fruits necessary for mannes suste∣naunce, chiefly with wheat, the which groweth there so plentifully, that therewith all the land of <HI>Portingall</HI> is furnished. The which they transport in their ships, with many good fruits, as well naturally of the Countrey, as other where: but there is one amongst others, named <HI>Hyrcy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hyrcy.</NOTE> the plant wherof was brought from the <HI>Indies,</HI> for there was none thereof found before, euen as in the <HI>Ca∣naries.</HI> Likewise in our <HI>Europe,</HI> before they began to la∣bor the earth, to plant and to sowe diuers kinds of fruits men were contented onely with that the earth brought forthe of his nature, hauing then to drinke nothing but cléere water, and for their clothing the barks and leaues of trées with certaine skins of beastes, as we haue alrea∣dy shewed. In the which we may cléerely sée a wonderful prouidence of our God, the which hath placed in the sea great quantitie of Ilands bothe little and great, which doeth abide and sustaine the brunt of the waues of the sea, that goeth not beyonde their compasse or limits, nei∣ther hurteth the inhabitaunts: for the Lord as the Pro∣phet sayth, hath appoynted his limits, the which he doeth not ouerpasse. Of these Ilands, some are inhabited that before were desert, and many are forsaken, that in times past were inhabited and peopled, as we sée hath hapned to many Cities and Townes of the Empire of <HI>Greece, Trapezande</HI> and <HI>Egipt,</HI> such is the ordinance of God, that things héere in earth shall not be perdurable, but subiect to chaunging. The which being considered of our <HI>Cos∣mographers</HI> in our dayes, they haue added to the Tables of <HI>Ptolomeus</HI> newe matters of our time, for since y<SUP>e</SUP> time and knowledge that he hath written, there hath happe∣ned many newe things. Now these Ilands of <HI>Essores;</HI> were desert, before that the <HI>Portingalls</HI> knew them. Ne∣uerthelesse

they were full of woods of all sorts, among the which is founde a kynd of Ceder named in their speach <HI>Orcantine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Orcantine a kinde of Ceder.</NOTE> with the which they make fyne kar∣ued works, as tables, cofers and many vessels for the Sea. This wood hath a very good smel, and wil not rot neither be worme eaten, be it dry or wette as other wood wil. Of the which also <HI>Plinie</HI> speaketh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plynie.</NOTE> that in his time was found at <HI>Rome,</HI> in an old Sepulcher certaine bookes of Philosophy betwene two stones within a lyttle chest made of Ceader wood, the which had ben vnder the grounde aboue fyue hundreth yeares.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A chest of Ce∣der.</NOTE> Fur∣thermore, I remember that I haue read in times past, that <HI>Alexander</HI> the great, passing into the Iland of <HI>Ta∣broban,</HI> founde a ship of Ceder wood on the borders or coast of the sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A ship of Ce∣der.</NOTE> whereas it had remayned aboue two hūdreth yeares without rotting.

Michael,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Iland of S. Michel.</NOTE> and it is the best peopled.

In one of these Ilands there is a hyll or moūtaine almost as high as that of <HI>Teneryf,</HI> of which we haue spoken, where as groweth great plenty of <HI>Pastel</HI>▪ of Suger, and some wyne, there is no rauening beasts to be found, but there is certaine wylde Goats &amp; many foules in the woods.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Authors conclusion.</NOTE>Here haue I louyng readers, shewed the discourse of this may farre and long voyage to the <HI>Ponent,</HI> the which I haue set forth as well as God hath gyuen me grace, for that I woulde not be founde vnprofytable, neither that this my enterprise should be in vayne, peraduen∣ture not so eloquently, as your delicate eares and ripe iudgement doth require. Therefore seing that it hath not bene the pleasure of God, that I should bestow my youth in learning, nor to obtain so much perfection as others, but rather in nauigation, I moste heartily be∣seeche you to excuse me. In the meane tyme if that it please you to take in good part this present worke, the which I haue gathered together being in the tempests and other discommodities of the sea, you shall encou∣rage me, after that I haue rested my selfe, and recon∣ciled my spirites, whiche are as scattered here and there, to set forth more fully and at large the lyeng and distāce of places, the which I haue obserued by eye as well in <HI>Leuant,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Authors Cardes, contay∣ning the lyeng &amp; distances of places.</NOTE> as in the <HI>Ponent,</HI> and in the South, the which I hope to shew you by eye, &amp; represent by liuely figures besides the Carde Marins, the which to speake the truthe, without offence or hurt of any man, do erre and fayle in many things, whether it be the faulte of those that pricke them or set them out, I leaue you to iudge. Furthermore, as it is vneasie so is it also vnpos∣sible for any one iustly to represent the most notable places their lyengs, and distances, without hauing

<P>By this ye may sée how long tyme we haue bene igno∣rant of many countreys, as well Ilands as maine landes, beleeuyng onely that, whiche oure Elders hadde set forth, vntyll that since of late yeares men haue ieoparded them selues in the Na∣uigation: So that nowe all our <HI>Hemispherie</HI> is dis∣couered and founde inhabited: of the which <HI>Ptolomeus,</HI> and others knewe not the halfe.</P>
