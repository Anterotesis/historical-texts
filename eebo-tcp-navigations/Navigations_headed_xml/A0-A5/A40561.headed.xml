<HEAD><HI>In a Letter from</HI> Chester <HI>of</HI> August <HI>the</HI> 31st.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Irish</HI> finding that they had not gain'd much Reputation by their Actions in the Field, or by being valiant and successful in the taking of Towns, were resolved at last to try what they could do in keeping of Towns committed to their Care and Courage: <HI>Carrick fergus</HI> was the place where they thought sit, in some measure, to retrieve their Credit and Reputation: But when our Frigats at Sea, and Land Forces at Land had appeared before it, and made such Breaches in the Walls, and Destruction in the Town, by their Guns and Bombs, they judged in safest for them to Capitulate and Surrender; which they did on <HI>Wednesday</HI> last. The Garrison consisted of near Two thousand Men, and though at the first Summons sent them by the Duke of <HI>Schom∣berg,</HI> they were so stout as to refuse to hearken to any Conditions of Surren∣der, yet their Courage not continuing long, they accepted of the Terms of Marching out with Colours flying Arms, and Drums beating, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to go to <HI>Charlemont.</HI> But such was the ill nature of the Rabble, that they fell upon
<PB N="2" REF="2"/> them in their March, and disarm'd them. The Town has been so misera∣bly defaced by the continual playing of the Bombs for Five Days together, that it looks like a dismal heap of ruine. Sir <HI>Henry Ingolsby</HI> is made Go∣vernour of the Town and Castle: A great deal of Arms, Ammunition, and Provisions of all sorts, was found in the Town. This has cleared the <HI>North,</HI> for the most part, of any considerable Party of the <HI>Irish:</HI> many come in dayly to the General. The Ships come last Night to <HI>High-lake,</HI> assure us of the Arrival of the Four Regiments of Horse into the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Carrick-fer∣gus;</HI> who were turning in into the <HI>Lake</HI> on <HI>Wednesday,</HI> as the Ships that are arrived here were turning out from thence.</P>
<P>Neither is it in <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> only, where Success does so constantly attend their Majesties Affairs, but even the <HI>West-Indies</HI> afford us variety of Examples of Zeal for his Majesties Service: For the Blossom of <HI>London</HI> coming from <HI>Antego,</HI> in <HI>June</HI> last, and arrived here two days ago, brings the News, that Sr. <HI>Nathaniel Johnston</HI> not finding it safe for him to continue longer upon those Islands, whereof he had the Government committed to him in the late Reign, is gone to <HI>Carolina,</HI> and that the Inhabitants of <HI>Mevis</HI> and other Islands had constituted Major General <HI>Codrington</HI> Governour in his room; That the <HI>Irish</HI> Planters and Inhabitants of <HI>Montserat</HI> had declared for the late King, and appeared in a Body of Seven or Eight hundred Men for that Interest, but that Colonel <HI>Blakeston,</HI> the Governour of the said Island had raised what <HI>English</HI> men he could, to the number of Two hun∣dred, with which he was resolved to attack them: But the <HI>Irish</HI> no sooner saw him appear with that unequal number of <HI>English,</HI> and to march to∣wards them, but they all offered to lay down their Arms, and upon Arti∣cles promised to disperse; at which instant of time a Reinforcement of an Hundred and fifty Men arrived from <HI>Antego</HI> and seized the chief of the <HI>Irish,</HI> brought them up Prisoners to <HI>Antego,</HI> and solemnly Proclaim'd King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> with all possible Demonstrations of Joy and Gladness. The new Governour <HI>Codrington</HI> hath sent an Hundred Men from <HI>Mevis</HI> to St. <HI>Christopher</HI>'s to strengthen the <HI>English</HI> Interest in that Island.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Hewets,</HI> and Colonel <HI>Villers</HI> Regiments of Horse are to embark with the first fair Wind for <HI>Ireland</HI> to joyn the Duke of <HI>Schomberg.</HI></P>
