<P>I Here present you with the pleasant History of the Fa∣mous and Renowned Knight, Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> of <HI>Southampton,</HI> a Man for his Virtue and Valour, highly esteemed throughout the World: In whose many Actions and glori∣ous Achievements, you will find things that may reasona∣bly surmout an ordinary credit, however in perusing them, you may plainly perceive the difference between Elder times and these we live in, which are too much divovled into ef∣feminacy, and please your self in consulting the many rare Adventures of such, as gave themselves up to the practice of Arms and Love, which being mingled in their many excellencies, appear as beautiful and gay as a Bed of Roses and Lillies, in their blushing Glory and innocent Candure, and as the noble Enterprizes of others have stirred up the Spirits of such as read them, to an illustrous imitation of what is truly great, and held in the highest esteem: So past all peradventure, what is here laid down, will not come be∣hind the most exaulted Actions of Heroes, set forth to the best advantage, either in Love or Arms, those two Excel∣lencies that adorn mankind; for here you will find our
<PB REF="3"/> Champion, though early crushed by the adverse hand of Fortune, making his way to Glory, before he could aspire to Manhood, cutting it by Dint of Valour and Heroick Conduct from a dejected state by degrees, till he mounts to the highest pinacle of Honour, in rescuing the distres∣sed, destroying Monsters and Tyrants, gaining Kingdoms, and converting Infidels to the Christian Faith, obleiging by his Affability and excellent parts Queens and Princesses, to lay their Diadems and Grandure at his feet, and doing such things as have amazed Mankind. Therefore for the honour of our Country, of which he has so well deserved, let his Memory live in the thoughts of every true English Man, and be to them a pattern of Heroick Virtue, that by imi∣tating him, they may raise the very name of the British Em∣pire, as formerly it was, to be the Terror of the World, which is the wish,</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>How Sir <HI REND="blackletterType">Guy</HI> Earl of <HI REND="blackletterType">Southampton,</HI> having married a fair Lady, had by her Sir <HI REND="blackletterType">Bevis;</HI> and how she afterward caused her Hus∣band to be treacherously slain in the Forrest, and married the Knight that slew him &amp;c.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the days, when <HI>England</HI> was more immediately renowned, for the famous and valiant Atchievements of other Knightsland Warlike, Champions, whose greht Actions and Heroick Enter∣prises were loudly trumped by Faine, in each part of the World. There dwelt at the antient and celebrated Town of <HI>Southampton,</HI> a Knight called Sir <HI>Guy,</HI> who in his Travels and search of Adven∣tures through the Countries of <HI>Flanders, France, Almain, Cicile, De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rk, Gascom, Hungary, Culabria, Burgundy, Poland, Nor∣mandy, Maine, Turkey, Eastland, Norway, Picardy, Scotland, Lumbardy, &amp;c.</HI> signalized his Valour in the Courrs of divers great Princes at Tilt, Tournament, and many mortal Combats, ever striving to right the injured, and such as suffered wrong <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their too powerful oppressors, and having spent his younger days in the exercise of Arms abroad, every where gaining a high esteem, at length Age rendring him unfit for great exploits, he resolved to give up the remainder of his lift to a more setled state in his own Country, and thereupon returning loaden with Lawrels won with infinite hazzard and danger, as also with the Presents and Favour of Emperors, Kings and Princes: he at length setled in the Town of <HI>Southamp∣ton,</HI> the place of his birth, but long he had not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d there in all so∣litary conrentment, and adicted himself to works of Piery and Charity, before King <HI>Edgar</HI> having been sufficiently informed of
<PB N="6" REF="4"/> his high deserts, made him Earl of that place, and calling him to Court, appointed him his Steward, or rather Vice-Roy, in which place he so well discharged his trust, in doing Iustice to every man, countenancing virtue and suppressing vice, that he gained an univer∣sal commendation: and being now where he had dayly the sight of a great many beautiful Ladies he bethought himself of Marriage, that so he might leave behind him an Heir to possess his great Wealth and Virtues; and casting his Eyes upon the Daughter of the King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who was then in the English Court, he so prevailed with the King of <HI>Scots,</HI> by the means of King <HI>Edgar</HI> his Master, that he soon had her to Wife; though this Marriage, by reason she had secretly placed her affections before, on the Emperor of <HI>Edmain's</HI> Brother, prove altogether unhappy to the Earl, as in the sequel will appear.</P>
<P>The Marriage Rites being performed with great splendor, and graced with the presence of the two Kings, and the Nobles of both Kingdoms: In process of time the Lady brought him forth a Son, whom they agreed to be called <HI>Bevis,</HI> afterward known, or common∣ly called by the name of <HI>Bevis</HI> of <HI>Southampton,</HI> whose Knighly Adven∣tures and noble Actions are the subject of this pleasant and renowned History. However the Lady still keeping up her affections for her former Lover, whose name was Sir <HI>Murdure,</HI> by reason he was sprightly, young and active, and Sir <HI>Guy</HI> her Husband on the con∣trary, being much in years, and not so apt as she required to satis∣fie her youthful desires, adicting himself rather to his Devotion, and to obtain a pardon for Sins by a thorough Repentance; which made her begin to conclude her self unhappy in this Marriage, and wished she had been given to him she more dearly affected, suffering her dis∣content dayly to increase, till at length growing from a dislike to a hatred of her Lord: She resolved to be rid of him, and thereupon sent a trusty Messenger to the Emperors Court, to acquaint Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> of her great Love to him, and the dislike she had of her Husband, assuring him, that he ever had her heart and entire affection, though forced by the commands of a Father, she had given her hand to another, which made her life uneasie, and that now there remained no way to render it comfortable, but by removing the man, who hindred the mingling of their mutual Passions and Af∣fections, and that to compleat both their happynessess, he would un∣dertake to kill him, she would so contrive it as to give him the op∣portunity,
<PB N="7" REF="4"/> by perswading him with a slender Train to hunt the Boa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the great Forrest then adjoyning to the Town of <HI>Southampton,</HI> and there with a strong well arm'd Guard might effect it at leasure.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>At the wicked proposal of the Lady, Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> stood for a while mute and much amazed, but at last, the great Love he had ever born to so beautiful a Woman, as was the Countess, and not knowing any other means to enjoy her, whom he now understood was as wil∣ling to yield, as he to intreat, consented to obey her pleasure, telling the Messenger, that on the first day of <HI>May</HI> he would arrive in <HI>England</HI> with a Company of well arm'd men, sufficient to bring a∣bout what she desired, and that done, lay himself at her feet, and re∣ing him with a gallant Steed, he dismissed him.</P>
<P>The Lady having heard the answer of the Knight, was much pleased thereat, and then upon feigning her self ill at ease, she sent a Servant to her Husband, to advertise him of it, who immediately came to her, and with much love and tenderness enquired into the
<PB N="8" REF="5"/> cause of her grief, who with a sigh replyed, that she was ignorant of it, unless it proceeded from a longing mind she had for to taste the flesh of a Wild-Boar, and when he demanded where one might be found, and it should at any rate be taken, she said she had been in∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>med, that a Boar had a long time haunted the neighbouring For∣rest, but taking her Lord about the Neck, she with a dissembling k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> entreated him not to hazard himself against so dangerous a Crea∣ture for her occasion, and rather than it should be, to suffer any in∣convenience; however as she wished, he would not decline it, but cal∣ling for his Horse, his Launce and Sword, with only two of his Servants, he betook himself to the Forrest in search of the Wild-Boar, but there he had not long been, but Sir <HI>Murdure,</HI> who had placed himself in ambush, burst out upon him, and reviling him by the name perfidious Traitor, for bereaving him of his Mistriss, whom he had a long time loved, and for whom he had suffered so much, he told him though he now enjoyed her, it should not be long for that both he and his Son should dy.</P>
<P>The Earl thus surprized, called to his Servants to advertize them of the Treachery, saying, at the same time, he would however in his own right, defend himself to the utmost, when having his Launce in his Rest, he run against Sir <HI>Murdure,</HI> and hitting him full, bore hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the ground, and thereupon drew his Sword, and being about to strike off his Head, he cryed out to his Fellows for rescue who came so furiously upon the Earl, that he was forced to desist, and defend himself, when having slain divers of them, they being twenty in number, and wanting his Armour, through the many wounds he had received, he was at last obleiged to forsake his Horse, who was likewise sorely wounded, and about to fall under him, yet he fought couragiously, but his Servants being slain, and he inclosed on every side, fainting through loss of blood, he said to Sir <HI>Murdure,</HI> for the honour of Knighthood and true Chivalry at this time spare my life, having me unarmed, at so great a disadvantage, and I promise, old as I am to arm my self, and meet you and your Train, and if you kill me then, I shall freely pardon you my death; but they would in no wise hearken to him, for whilst he was about to proceed, in requiring his life to be spared, Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> with his Spear run him through the body, and those that accompanied him gave him so many wounds that he dyed on the place; after which the unworthy Knight cut off his Head, and sent it by one of his Servants, as a Present to the Lady,
<PB N="9" REF="5"/> assuring her he would be with her that night: whereat she appeared much overjoyed, and received it with great satisfaction; promising to be at his Devotion: And accordingly he soon after Wedded the Lady, it being be∣fore given out that her Husband the Earl was Murthered by a Band of Robbers.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Bevis</HI> was delivered to Sir <HI>Sabre</HI> to be put to Death, by the com∣mand of his Mother and Step-Father. The means by which he was saved; and how, in the Habit of a Shepherd, he kept Sheep, and in some part revenged his Fathers Murther. How he left the Land, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>BEvis</HI> hearing of his Fathers Death, greatly lamented it; and being of some years of understanding, soon perceived by his Mothers car∣riage, and whisperings amongst the Servants, as also Sir <HI>Murdure</HI>'s high
<PB N="10" REF="6"/> Entertainment, that she had not the least hand in the contriving it, and thereupon took the freedom to tell her his thoughts, in such bitter Language as incensed her grievously to chastize him; but finding him obstinate and fearing one day he would not only discover but revenge his Fathers Death, she resolved to make him away, and thereupon consulted with one Sir <HI>Sabre,</HI> over whom she had a great power and influence, to destroy him; who accordingly promised it, without any intention to perform it. Wherefore, that he might keep notwithstanding in her good opinion, he took him home to his House, pretending it required great Privacy; and there he informed the Youth of the danger he was in, and how that he had it in charge to kill him, but on the contrary was resolved to conceal him, till such time he was able to bear Arms for the recovery of his Fathers Estate: adding, That he, for the Friendship he bore Sir <HI>Guy,</HI> would then assist him with a power sufficient to effect it, and whilst he had an op∣portunity, to convey him to his other Vncle, who was an Earl in <HI>Wales,</HI> he should keep his Sheep upon the neighbouring Downs. At this <HI>Bevis</HI> wept for anger, to be so used by his cruel Mother whilst his Fathers Murtherer revelled in his Palace, yet concealed it as well as he could, in hopes, one day to be revenged, condescending to have his rich Cloaths changed for those of a Shepherd, all tattered and ragged; and in that disguise drove forth Sir <HI>Sabre</HI>'s Sheep each morning, warily guarding them upon the flowry Plains, and chearing himself with his Pipe of Reeds, wearing a Shepherds Scrip, and carrying in his hand a Crook, and at Even he brought them home again, contenting himself with course Fare and a homely Lodging; till coming to the Age of sixteen years he exercised the first proof of his valour upon a fierce and cruel Wolf, late∣ly come into those parts, that destroyed not only many Sheep and tender Lambs but killed some of the Shepherds that sought to defend them, and put others to the slight; and thinking to do the like to <HI>Bevis,</HI> who was com∣ing to the Field, met him open-mouth'd, but <HI>Bevis</HI> with the end of his Crook struck him so full on the head as he came at him, that he fell to the Ground; when closing with him, he with much ease strangled him with main force, which made the Neighbouring Shepherds exceedingly rejoyce, and much praise the courage and resolution of <HI>Bevis,</HI> who by this Act had delivered them from fear and danger. And soon after he began to show his strength, insomuch that none were able to contend with him, ei∣ther at Wrestling, Running, Throwing the Bar, or at hard Blows, so that his Renown began by degrees to spread abroad, and many both lo∣ved and feared him.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="6"/>
<P><HI>Bevis</HI> not well pleased in his mind to follow this imploy, whilst those that were unworthy of it, possessed his Fathers Estate, although he, as much as in him lay, strugled to conceal his Quality: yet had he ma∣ny Conflicts with himself, and thus expostulated: <HI>Shall I,</HI> said he, <HI>who am the Son of an Earl, born to large Fòrtunes, thus suffer hun∣ger and cold, go in tattered Garments and lye hard and uneasie, the Ground being for the most part my Bed, and the Sky my Canopy, it must not be; but rather will</HI> Bevis <HI>suffer any danger, and boldly contemn the malice and Fury of his Enemies.</HI> And whilst he was in these meditations, he heard from the Town of <HI>Southampton</HI> the sound of Trumpets, Hoitboys and Fluits, which made him address himself to a Traveller coming from thence, to know the meaning of it, and from him understood that Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> held a great Feast, freely for all Persons that would participate of his Dainties in honour of his Mar∣riage-day, which he had done every year on that occasion. This made<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> <HI>Bevis</HI> being now so near the Town, resolved to be a Spectator of the Revels that were kept in his Fathers Palace, which, in the Disguise
<PB N="12" REF="7"/> he was in, he thought he might do without discovery, and by that means learn something that might turn to his advantage. So leaving his Sheep at a venture, he hasted thither; but being about to enter, and the Porters seeing him in so tattered and ragged a Garment, they churlishly thrust him back, telling him, if he expected any of their Masters Bounty he must stay in the Lodge, or at the Door, for such a beggarly Fellow as he must not expect to sort himself with such noble Guess as were in the Palace: at which being angry, <HI>Bevis</HI> replyed, that he must and would en∣ter and sit at the Table with the Master of the Palace himself, and to that purpose he was come. But they still thrusting him back and giving bad language, from words they fell to blows, when <HI>Bevis</HI> thor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ghly enraged fell'd one of them with his Fist, and layed the other with a st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ak of his Truncheon dead at his Feet, and so passed into the Hall, where he found the Guess seated in a splendid manner, the Tables loaded with varieties of divers kinds, and Wine flowing in abundance; when <HI>Bevis</HI> finding an empty place sate down, which Sir <HI>Murdure,</HI> who sate with his Countess at the upper end of the Table, noting, and angry that such a Guess had been admitted, began to chase at his Porters, at the same time rising from his Place, and charging him under the penalty of severe punishments to depart: but <HI>Bevis</HI> told him he expected a bet∣ter welcome, especially in a place he had been so intimate in; and that though he were in a poor Garment he knew not but that he was more noble descended than himself, and that in proof thereof, if he found himself ag∣grieved, and if he might have Arms provided him he would enter the Com∣bate against himself, or any Knight of the Company. This so incensed Sir <HI>Murdure,</HI> that disdaining to reply, he drew his Sword to have taken his Head for offering, as he deemed it, such an affront to himself and his noble Guess: at which <HI>Bevis</HI> leaping from his place, with his Trun∣cheon warded the Blow; nor then did he fail to hit Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> with such force, as brought him to the ground, and was about with a second stroak to finish his days, when the Countess and other Ladies cryed out to the Knights to run in and prevented it, and <HI>Bevis</HI> finding him∣self amidst so many drawn Swords, thought it time to retire, which accordingly he did, securing or making good his Retreat with Sir <HI>Mur∣dure</HI>'s Sword, which he had wrested from him, wounding divers that had been too forward in pressing on, crying in vain to the Porters to shut the Gates and keep him in, that they might be revenged of the Affront.</P>
<P><HI>Bevis</HI> thinking himself partly revenged of his Father-in-law, went secretly to Sir <HI>Sabre</HI> and told him all that had passed, who was much
<PB N="13" REF="7"/> displeased thereat, saying, <HI>That it would soon be known who he was, and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> himself must consequently suffer for concealing him,</HI> Howe∣ver he caused him to be hid in the Wood for some time, till he thought the se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch might be over. Nor did his conjectures much fail him, for the Countess, after recovering from the Sound she fell into, upon sup∣posing her Husband slain, declared, that she verily Believed it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Son <HI>Bevis,</HI> as well by his voice as a mark in his Face, that had tooke in disguise to disturb her Peace, vowing the destruction of Sir <HI>Sabre</HI> at he had not made him away: And thereupon, in a great rage, she went attended with a Guard to his House, and finding him there, charged him as false and faithless to his promise, threatning him with Tortur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and Death, for abusing her Trust: but he on the contrary, all edges <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had been obedient to her Commands, producing the Cloaths he had p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣posely dipped in the Blood of a Swine: however, so confident she was of the contrary, <HI>viz.</HI> That he was not made away, that having rated and reviled him as long as she pleased, without hearkning to any of his excuses, charged two Knights to carry him to a Castle adjoyning to the Forrest, and there Imprison him till hers and he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lords Pleasure were father known.</P>
<P><HI>Bevis</HI> hearing of the misfortune of his Vncle, resolved at the hazard of his life to set him at liberty: and with this resolution, getting a Palmer's Gown, and arming himself under it with a trusty Sword, he went and knocked at the Gate, in which disguise he had entrance, without being suspected, and by main force having subdued the Keepers or Warders, he with an Iron Bar he found there, burst in sunder the Doors for more speed, and finding Sir <HI>Sabre</HI> there in Chains, he set him forthwith at Liberty, and binding the Keepers in the same Chains left the Castle; yet knowing they would be narrowly sought after, <HI>Be∣vis</HI> agreed to leave the Land in search of Adventures, and Sir <HI>Sabre</HI> giving out that it was not <HI>Bevis,</HI> but an unknown Knight in disguise, who had done the Mischief, and wrought his deliverance; <HI>Bevis</HI> being to his knowledge certainly dead, his Possessions that had been taken from him were again restored, and he received into fovour.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How Sir <HI REND="blackletterType">Bevis</HI> was shipwracked in a Storm, taken Prisoner and sold to sundry Merchants, who presented him to the King of <HI>Armony,</HI> who kindly entertained him. How the fair Princess <HI REND="blackletterType">Iosian</HI> fell in Love with him. And how he fought with and overcome sixty <HI REND="blackletterType">Sa∣razens,</HI> and was doomed to dye, and how delivered.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>BEvis</HI> having taken the Sea in a small Bark, a great Tempest hap∣pened, almost as soon as it was put from Land, and continued with such Fury, that all rule was lost, and the Ship riding furiously before the Wind, beaten with Rain, Thunder, Lightning and the Waves of the Sea, neither Sun, Moon, nor Stars appearing for many days, they were at last driven into a strong Haven in the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, possessed by the <HI>Sarazens,</HI> where the Vessel being broken on the Rocks,
<PB N="15" REF="8"/> <HI>Bevis</HI> with some few got on shoar, but there, contrary to the Rules of Hospitality, they were encountered and taken Prisoners by a great pow∣er of the Infidels, who sold them to the Merchants, bound for the Coast of <HI>Egypt,</HI> who presented <HI>Bevis,</HI> as a very comely Personage, to the King of <HI>Armony,</HI> who then had to his Daughter a Princess exceeding fair and beautifull, adorned with all the rare perfections that make Women∣kind tempting and desirable, on whom <HI>Bevis</HI> fixing his Eyes, began to think he had never seen any so charming, her Eyes seemed like two Stars, her Forehead like polished Alablaster, her Cheeks out-did the Roses, and her Lips and Teeth might compare with Rubies and Pearls, all her other parts being proportionably beautifull; but above all she was possessed with a virtuous mind and courteous behaviour.</P>
<P><HI>Bevis</HI> being now in the Court of <HI>Armony,</HI> the King had great delight to see a Youth so comely, well set and strong proportioned in his Limbs, every part of him expressing a more than manly form, and promising ex∣traordinary strength; wherefore giving him words of comfort, he began to question him about his Birth and Parentage, who freely told him that he was Son to <HI>Guy</HI> Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> and that his Father being treacherously slain by the consent of his Mother, who likewise sought his Life, he had betaken himself to travel, and being unfortunately ta∣ken Prisoner, he had been sold to those Merchants who had presented him to his Highness. Vpon this the King embraced him, and told him he was now more dear to him, as being the Son of Sir <HI>Guy,</HI> whose Fame had sounded loud in those parts, and his many noble Actions made his name immortal; however, grieving that the World had lost so brave a Man by Treatchery, that could not have been overcome by fair force, constituted <HI>Bevis</HI> his great Chamberlain, committing to his care and charge Vestures of Gold, Silver and Pearls, Diamonds and other precious stones and great riches in abundance, being wonderfully pleased, as often as his great Affairs would give him leisure, to hold dis∣course with him of many things, for <HI>Bevis</HI> was no ways ignorant of any Learning. And so it happened, that he had not long been in this place with a promise of being made General of the King's Army, when occa∣sion should require, and to that purpose received the Order of Knighthood.</P>
<P>But fair <HI>Josian,</HI> the King's Daughter, fixed her Eyes upon him, and from liking changed to Love, insomuch that at length she passionately doated on him; nor did she refrain to let her Father know it, who pro∣mised not to restrain her in her Inclination, but rather further it, in consideration <HI>Bevis</HI> would renounce his Religion and become a Proselyte
<PB N="16" REF="9"/> to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and undertook on a day to discourse him on this occasion. For taking him by the hand and leading him into a pleasant Garden, un∣der the shade of Orange Trees, he made him sit down by him, there being none but these two, all others being strictly forbidden entrance, he thus began.</P>
<P>Bevis, said he, <HI>What if the most beautifull Lady of my Kingdom courted, honoured and adored by Kings and Potentates, should not∣withstanding neglect their Favours, and cast her Love upon one of a much lower degree, ought he not to condescend to any thing that shall be desired for such a Wife, and perhaps in a short time a Kingdom into the Bargain?</HI> To this <HI>Bevis,</HI> when he had paused and blushed a while, making an humble obeisance, replyed, <HI>That certainly that Man was most happy of all others, and ought to esteem his Life and For∣tunes to mean a return for such a gracious condescention. Ay,</HI> but continued the King, <HI>suppose that the case require him to abjure his Re∣ligion, and that your self was the Man on whom this great Fortune would bestow her self, and could do it upon no other Terms, would you receive her upon this condition?</HI> Now whilst the King was im∣patiently expecting his Answer, <HI>Bevis</HI> fell upon his knees, and with hands and eyes up-lifted to Heaven, implor'd God to strengthen his Faith, and protect him from falling into so great a Wickedness: Then rising and bowing low to the King he said, <HI>Most gracious Lord, if I must answer in this point, I could for the Lady you mention, who, if I may presume to guess at your meaning, is no less than the fair Prin∣cess, willingly Sacrifice all the Service of my Life, wade through Seas of Blood and Danger, nor think any thing sufficient to merit so much condescending Goodness, no not my Life; but for the Christian Reli∣gion, that dearer part of Life, on which depends my eternal happi∣ness, to renounce that, and deny the Lord that bought me: pardon Mighty Sir, if in this I must refuse any complyance, no, not for ten Thousand Worlds, nor all the Beauties of them.</HI></P>
<P>The King hearing <HI>Bevis</HI> thus unalterably fixed, and firm to the Faith he professed, waved to press it further, and fell into other discourse, and in the end, his great Affairs requiring him in the Palace, he departed. Nor was it long after, that <HI>Bevis</HI> shewed by proof how far he durst haz∣ard himself in the vindication of the Religion he professed; for being a∣broad on a <HI>Christmas</HI>-day, well mounted and armed, he met sixty <HI>Sarazens</HI> who as Enemies to our Saviour, began to joke upon <HI>Bevis</HI> in relation to the day, who returning them smart answers, which they took for a re∣viling
<PB N="17" REF="9"/> their Prophet <HI>Mahomet,</HI> they began to urge him more: to which he replyed, if he was but so well armed as Sir <HI>Guy</HI> his Father had sometimes been in that Countrey, they should soon perceive their vile <HI>Mahomet</HI> should not be able to deliver them from his just anger. At that, said one to the other, <HI>Do you hear how this Christian Hound reviles our Prophet, and boasts against us, wherefore let us no lon∣ger delay to chastize him with death.</HI> Vpon this, they all prepared to assault him, who with his Fist beating one of them (with his Neck broke) to the ground, wrested from him his Sword, and so layed about him that heads and arms strewed all the place, and in a short time he drove those that survived before him to a River, wherein they desperately threw themselves, for fear of the Sword, and all but two perished, who hasted to the Court with the dismal News, desiring he might be put to death for cursing, as they suggested, their Prophet, the Law of the Land making it Death, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The King though he loved <HI>Bevis,</HI> yet inraged that the valour of his Kingdom was so much eclipsed by a Stranger, consented, notwithstand∣ing that according to the Law of the Country, he should suffer Death: of which fair <HI>Josian</HI> having notice, hastily entered her Father's Chamber and throwing her self at his Feet, with Tears besought him not rashly to put his severe Commands in execution, but rather allow so much respite as the Parties might appear Face to Face, and then if it appear∣ed <HI>Bevis</HI> was guilty of what had been witnessed against him, he might more justly suffer him to receive his Doom. These words of the beaute∣ous Princess so far prevail'd that the King consented, and thereupon she dispatched two Messengers to order <HI>Bevis</HI> to come and confer with her a∣bout his safety, who accordingly found him on his Couch, for he had su∣stained in the Battle above twenty Wounds, and was faint through loss of Blood, yet seeing them approach, and supposing they were the two <HI>Sarazens</HI> that had escaped his Fury, and came now privately to as∣sassinate him, in revenge of the death of their Fellows, he lookt so stern∣ly on them, and began withall to gather his Sword that they retired from him, and durst onely deliver their Message at a distance: but he not crediting it, but rather supposing it a trick to decoy him into some ambush they had layed for his Life, as not knowing what the King had determined, he refused to go, threatning them with Death if they did not instantly depart: who carrying this Message, or rather refusal to the Princess, and she knowing it was no time to dally when the Life of a Man whom she loved above all Mankind was in the Ballance, laying
<PB N="18" REF="10"/> aside all scruples and niceties, she went attended with two Knights to his Chamber, where <HI>Bevis</HI> perceiving so bright a Creature, who had long since conquered his affections, rose and threw himself at her Feet, expressing himself altogether unworthy of so great a favour, and expressed a thousand thanks, with all imaginable respect, but she not suffering him long to kneel, clasped her snowy Arms about him, and rai∣sed him gently from the ground, and as she raised him stole a gentle kiss, at which <HI>Bevis</HI> in a manner ravished with joy, began to demand the cause of her coming, who thereupon told him what had been witnessed against him, and in what danger he was, and how she had interceeded on his behalf, and obtained so much favour of the King, as to hear him in Person as to the matter whereof he stood accused, giving him Instructions how he should behave himself, and promising to deal further with the King on his behalf, she left the Knights to dress his Wounds and departed.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How Sir <HI REND="blackletterType">Bevis</HI> won the favour of the Princess <HI REND="blackletterType">Iosian,</HI> and kill'd a monstrous Boar in the Forrest, and fought with and overcome fifteen Forresters, that estayed to take the head of the Boar from him. and how King <HI REND="blackletterType">Bradamound</HI> of <HI REND="blackletterType">Damascus</HI> proclaimed War, for <HI REND="blackletterType">Iosi∣an</HI> and was overcome, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>BEvis</HI> by this visit of the fair Princess, having in a manner new Life put into him, his Wounds were soon cured, and his kind Advocate in the mean while had so taken off the edge of the Kings Anger, that when the matter was rightly understood, he was not only cleared but his Accusers doomed, at their choice, either to sight him, or to suffer Banish∣ment; who having too lately experienced his more than humane force, gladly chose the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atter. And now <HI>Bevis</HI> not only frequently enjoyed the presence of the fair Princess, but gained great Reputation in the Court, being either loved or feared of all: And whilst he was thus happy, News came by many of the Villagers who had sled from their Habitations, That a monstrous Boar was lately come into the Neighbouring Plains and had killed divers Shepherds and Travellers, so that the Forrest was rendered impassible; and many assembling to destroy him, when they be∣held
<PB N="19" REF="10"/> his fiery Eyes, his huge Tus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and his horrid Bristles that stood up like a grove of Spears, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d from him, yet some of them were taken and carshed to pieces, so that the entrance of the Den where he usually aboad, was strewed with the bones of the slain.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><HI>Bevis</HI> waiting upon the Princess, at the arrival of this News, greatly rejoyced, as now finding an opportunity to signalize his valour for her sake; and therefore without delay besought her that he might enterprize the killing of this Monster; and although she used many Arguments, to disswade him from so great a danger, he nevertheless thirsting after Glory, so importuned her that she consented he should try his fortune for ridding the Country of so great a mischief.</P>
<P><HI>Bevis</HI> having obtained leave, being well Mounted &amp; Armed, rode secret∣ly to the Forrest, whilst the Princess sent after him her best Wishes, and having roused the Monster, he came at him with open Mouth, his Bristles standing up an end, and with a horrible grunting or roaring set upon <HI>Bevis,</HI> who run against him with his Launce, but that shive∣red in pieces, and obliged him to draw his Sword, so that laying upon
<PB N="20" REF="11"/> the Monsters Head, and nimbly avoiding the Fury of his Tusks, a dread∣full contention ensued, for so hard was the Skin of the Beast that he appeared, in a manner incapable of receiving any wound; insomuch that he began to be weary with striking, and a little retired; which the Boar perceiving, came at him more furious, and with his Tusk gave him a deep Wound in the Thigh; but as he attempted to redouble it, <HI>Bevis</HI> thrust with great force, his Sword under his neather Iaw, where, the Skin being somewhat foft, it enter'd, and he following hard upon it, so far it went that it pierced the Boars heart, who thereupon fell down with a horrible groan, which made the Forrest tremble, and breathed his last.</P>
<P>The Boar thus dead, <HI>Bevis</HI> sundred his Head from his Body, and bearing it upon his broken Launce, returned in Triumph with the spoil: but by the way being met by fifteen Forresters, and they envying him the Glory of so great an Atchievement, resolved amongst themselves to kill him, and take the head from him, that they might have the praise and reward as being taken for those that slew the Boar; and so before he was well aware, they set upon him, incompassing him on every side; when about to draw his Sword, he found he had left it with the Body of the Boar, which made him throw down the Head, and with the Trun∣cheon of his Spear, beat two of them that attack'd him to the ground, sorely bruised and wounded, and so laid about him, that in spire of the resistance they made, he killed nine of them in a shore space; and those that remained, perceiving his matchless Prowess, and the mighty force of his Stroaks, supposing him not to be of mortal Race, retired from him, and at length secured their Retreat, amongst the Trees and Thick∣ets, and by that means saved their Lives, so that <HI>Bevis</HI> had now lea∣sure to take up the Boars head, and depart to the fair Princess, at whose feet he layed it; but she, that he might gain the better esteem with her Father, desired him to carry it to the King, which he accordingly did, and was very kindly received, his Fame for this deed spreading far and wide, the Country People calling him their Deliverer; which did not a little please <HI>Josian:</HI> so that, holding a private Conference with him, they passed their mutual Vows, never to Marry, by consent, unless they Married each other.</P>
<P>To cross these happy Lovers, Fortune, that seldome long plays true, so ordered it that <HI>Bradamound</HI> King of <HI>Damascus</HI> having heard the Fame of <HI>Josian</HI>'s Beauty, and earnestly desiring to have her to Wife, sent boldly to demand her, of her Father King <HI>Ermine,</HI> swearing by his
<PB N="21" REF="11"/> Gods if she were not sent, according to his desire, he would come with an Army and take her by force, and not only so, but destroy his Country with Fire and Sword: at which insulting Message, King <HI>Ermine,</HI> being a little alarmed, and much inraged, assembled his Nobles in Council, to consult what ought to be done on this occasion, and at the instance of <HI>Josian,</HI> who protested against <HI>Bradamound;</HI> it was agreed that the defi∣ance should be returned, and <HI>Bevis,</HI> who gladly accepted it, made Gene∣ral of King <HI>Ermine</HI>'s Forces; and for his great Credit amongst the Souldiers, Dubbed him a Knight, from which time we must call him Sir <HI>Bevis;</HI> so that Forces being every where raised, an Army of 20000 Men were mustered, and fair <HI>Josian,</HI> the better to furnish out her Knight, brought him a famous Steed called <HI>Arundel,</HI> almost as re∣nowned as <HI>Bucephalus,</HI> and having caused him compleatly to be armed, she girded on a Sword called <HI>Morglay,</HI> the force of whose well temper∣ed edge no Armour could resist; and so clasping him in those Walls of Steel, gave him a gentle Kiss: at which he, smiling, said, <HI>Dear Ma∣dam, this Favour has made your Knight half a Conquerer before he enters on the War, and be assured no force can overcome the Man that undertakes your Quarrel.</HI> And now Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> being armed and mounted, caused the Trumpets to be sounded and the Banners to be displayed, marshalling his Men in such orders as was admirable in so young a General, who had not been greatly acquainted with the Trains of War; so that now nothing but a Foe being wanting, the Army marched to meet the proud King <HI>Bradamound,</HI> before he entered the Country to spoil or waste it; and accordingly Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> soon found him en∣camped upon a large Plain, but the Pagan King being double the num∣ber, set little by it; yet after both Armies had for a while faced each o∣ther, and bid defiance, a fearfull Combate ensued, so that the Showers of Arrows in a manner darkened the Sky, and what together with the clashing of Swords, the Shouts of the Victors, the cryes of the Van∣quished, the neighing of Horses, and the noise of warlike Instruments, it seemed as if the dissolution of all things was at hand, insomuch that the wild Beasts in the forrests and mountains stood amazed and trembled, as wondring what so great a clamour and confusion should mean: and because the <HI>Saraz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns</HI> much sto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ked about the Standart of their King to defend it, it being born by one <HI>Radison</HI> a Giant-like man, <HI>Bevis,</HI> the sooner to discourage them, furiously with his Sword, broke into that quarter, and making his way over heaps of the Slain, dispersing his Foes on e'ry side with a terrible destruction, he charged upon him with his
<PB N="22" REF="12"/> Spear, which violently entering, his Shield pierced his Armour and run quite through his Body, so that he fell dead to the ground, and with a horrible g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oan, breathed out his last: And so proceeding to charge the rest, he s on put them to the rout, and brought away the Standard, which so discouraged the Infidels, that they fell into confusion, and fled into all Parts; when <HI>Bradamound,</HI> in a rage, supposing to restore the Battel, ranged through his disordered People, and came where Sir <HI>Be∣vis</HI> was cutting down whole Ranks, instantly reviling him by the name of Christian Slave, and urging him to the Combate with many loud re∣proaches; upon which a dreadfull Fight happened, the one sighting through true courage, and the other through rage and dispair; but at length Sir <HI>Bevis,</HI> with a redoubled blow, cutting through <HI>Bradamound</HI>'s Helmet, which thereupon falling off, and he likewise to the Ground, cryed out for mercy, offering Cities, Towns and Castles for the Ran∣som of his Life, at which Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> smiling said, is this the courage you shew for fair <HI>Josian,</HI> to fetch whom, you have taken all these Pains, and caused so much bloodshed, however, though you deserve to dye for your bold presumption, yet since I find you thus humble, make a solemn pro∣testation that you will, whenever it shall be required, make a tributary Vas∣salage and do Homage to King <HI>Ermine,</HI> holding your Kingdom at his Pleasure, and I will not only save your Life, which is now in my Power, but set you free from the Swords of the inraged Souldiers, who thirst after your Blood.</P>
<P>King <HI>Bradamound</HI> being of a proud Temper, paused a while at these Conditions, imposed upon him by the Conqueror, but finding he must consent or loose his Life, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th much regret he chose the former, and ac∣cordingly Proclamation was made, to spare the Lives of the flying Ene∣my, of whom already about 20000 were slain, insomuch that the Plains blushed, and became slippery with Blood: and now the Battel being intirely won, Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> giving the spoil to his Souldiers, return∣ed to King <HI>Ermine,</HI> to give him an account of his success, who great∣ly rejoyced thereat: but the Princess had a greater share of the Ioy, to find her self not only freed from the man she hated, but in great likely∣hood to be Wedded to him she most passionately loved; for now the King was so highly pleased with Sir <HI>Bevis</HI>'s brave and generous Conduct, that he recommended his Daughter to his private Entertainment and Reception, so that with his consent he had have to visit the beautifull Lady in her Chamber; who when they were together by themselves, ear∣nestly beholding him, said, with a sigh, and then a rosie Blush over∣spread
<PB N="23" REF="12"/> her Virgin Face: <HI>How long will it be, Sir Knight, before you will fully understand how much I love you, and how passionately? pardon my free expression, I desire to be your Wife:</HI> to which <HI>Bevis,</HI> over-ravished with Ioy, yet dissembling, as well as he could, the excess of his Passion, replyed, <HI>Most lovely Maid, it cannot sink into my Thoughts, that she whom Kings have courted, and truly deserves the greatest Potentate on Earth, will condescend to wed a Stranger, who though perhaps nobly born, yet is destitute at present of those mighty Fortunes, that your merit justly requires and abundantly deserves: Thrones and Scepters I have none, nor can I incircle your head with a sparkling Diadem, of which you may otherwise furnish your self.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> expressing himself as aforesaid, and being misconstrued by the fair <HI>Josian,</HI> she said he slighted and contemned her proffered Love, and therefore sought those excuses, grew angry or appeared seemingly so, upbraiding him with too much neglect and coldness of affection, pressing her resentments so home, that she urg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d he could not, as he said, he no∣bly descended and prove so cruel to one that dearly loved him, and so far proceeded on that Subject, that Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> sensibly sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing his honour touch'd, went discontented from her Chamber; nor did she at that time further endeavour to slay him: However, soon after having notice that his discontent had creat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d an Indisposition both of body and mind, she she sent to comfort him, and in the end payed him a Visit, again unfold∣ing to him the secrets of her Heart; and there it was concluded between them, that the Princess becoming a Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ian, he should marry her: but knowing her Father would not suffer her to do it u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on that condition, it was further agreed, that with all her Iewels and Treasure th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y should secretly depart for <HI>England:</HI> but this Conf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>greement, being overheard by two of King <HI>Bradamound</HI>'s Knights, taken to the late Battle, they secretly advised King <HI>Ermine</HI> of it, and he thereupon consulted them what was to be done to prevent a business t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y displeased him, for he would not by any means hear that his Dau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>r should renounce the Religion of her Country, though otherways <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng enough she should be married to this renowned Stranger; so that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he should carry away the Lady by stealth, it was resolved he should be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣cured till matters could be better understood: but how with honour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> do it, the King was at a loss, till in the end, these two evil Counsellors put it into his mind to send him with a Letter to King <HI>Bradamound</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho therein should be required to make him his Prisoner.

<P>SIR <HI>Bevis</HI> being on his way, mounted, for speed, on a Horse of lit∣tle strength, and a Sword of small force by his side, as he was ri∣ding by a Forrest he espyed one in a Palmer's Waed at his repast, who seeing him coming, rose to meet him, and invited him to partake of his slender fare, which Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> not refusing, alighted and fell too; when the Palmer began to ask him divers Questions, and amongst the rest, in what Countries he had travelled, and being informed, he further de∣manded, if he had never in his Travels met with one <HI>Bevis</HI> an <HI>English</HI>-man born a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Southampton;</HI> at which Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> being a little surprized, as wondring who it should be that enquired after him in so strange a Land, demanded why he enquired after him, and who he was: where∣upon Sir <HI>Terrey,</HI> for so was this seeming Palmer named, told him that he being Son to Sir <HI>Sabre,</HI> and his Father being in great danger to loo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e his Life, by the Tretchery of Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> of <HI>Almain,</HI> unless within a time limited he could find a Champion to answer him on his be∣half in the Field, for that he had contrived the sending away of <HI>Bevis</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="13"/> Son to the Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> who was committed to him to be slain, he had sent him in search of <HI>Bevis,</HI> to come and be his Champion, whom he knew, by this time, to be of strength sufficient to undertake the Combate, and had charged him, on the honour of his Knighthood, not to return till he had found him, or so far had knowledge where he was that he might send to acquaint him with it: To this Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> replyed, That he knew the Man, and had contracted intimate acquaintance with him, but at present being bound on a Message to <HI>Damascus,</HI> he could no further accommodate him with his presence; however, upon his return, he would so far oblige him in the matter, that <HI>Bevis</HI> should come to <HI>England,</HI> and undertake the Combate.

<PB N="26" REF="14"/> lovingly embraced each other, they parted, and took their several ways, <HI>Bevis</HI> for <HI>Damascus,</HI> and Sir <HI>Terry</HI> for <HI>England.</HI> Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> being come with∣in sight of the City, was wonderfully taken with the pleasantness of it, as being adorned with Castles, Towers and stately Palaces, shining with Gold and precious Stones; and at the Gate was placed an Ea∣gle of Gold wondrous large, whose Eyes were two great Carbuncles, which in the night gave a large light to Strangers passing thitherward; so that boldly entring, he made towards the Pallace of the King to deli∣ver his Letter, not dreaming it contained matter against his Life: but by the way passing through their heathenish Temple, he espied a great number of People preparing to do a Sacrifice to their Idols with Songs and much false Devotion, whereat inflamed with a Christian zeal, he thrust in amongst the Superstitious rout, and tearing down the Idols, brake them in pieces and trampled them under his feet; which so offend∣ed the Pagans that they resolved to put him to Death, with the most ex∣quisite Torments; when gathering thick about him, some of them lay∣ed hold of him, but were soon obliged to let go, for perceiving himself in danger, he drew his Sword and dispersed them on every side, scattering the Pavement with their heads and mangled Limbs, insomuch that the Multitude continually encreasing, the Vproar waxed exceeding great, and many that fled from his revengefull Sword, hasted to Alarum the Court, telling the King, that if he did not succour the Citizens with his Guards, there was a Man, or the Devil in the shape of one, who would put them all to the Sword; further adding, he had already de∣stroyed their Gods, in whose power and protection they trusted, and was coming towards the Pallace, killing and beating down all that stood in his way, or opposed him.</P>
<P>At this news, the King caused all his Men to Arm, and as he was issuing over the Bridge, Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> was come to the foot of it, and per∣ceiving it was the King, made signs that he had a Message to him, greeting him from King <HI>Ermine,</HI> who at the first sight of him started back, as well knowing who it was; but being invironed with armed Men, and perceiving that Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> had sheathed his Sword, he sternly demanded his business, who, not forgetting his Distance, bending his knee to the Ground, delivered the Letter, the Contents of which were these.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>To King <HI>Bradmound,</HI> King <HI>Ermine</HI> sendeth Greeting:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHereas Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> of <HI>Southampton</HI> came lately a Stranger into my Court, and occasioned the Quarrel between you and me, in disswading my Daughter to yield her self your Wife, and has since gone about to make her renounce her Religion, intending privately to carry her away to his own Country, I thought good to advertize you thereof; wherefore, that there may be a right understanding be∣tween us, for the future, I not thinking it convenient to lay hands on him my self, have sent him to you to chastize him at your Discretion; wherefore by no means let him scape, for he being once removed I doubt not, but it will be easie to work my Daughter to a complyance with your Demands, that all animosities may cease between us: and so we bid you heartily farewell.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>This pleased <HI>Bradmound,</HI> and made him change his Countenance into terrour, as knowing Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> was now abandoned by King <HI>Er∣mine,</HI> and put into his power to revenge the mischief he had done him, and began immediately to consult what Death or Torture he should be put to, some gave Counsel to Burn him to Ashes, others to Flee him alive, others again to draw him through the City, and hang him upon Tenters; but at last they concluded to cast him into a deep filthy Dun∣geon, where two fierce Dragons were kept: and now Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> plainly perceiving that there was mischief plotted against him, said, <HI>Sir as I am a Knight, let me dye the Death of a Souldier, in the Field; the which if you grant me a Horse and Armour, to dye valiantly fighting, it will more redound to your Glory, and the courage of the Knights that shall have the honour to slay me.</HI> But the King without any reply, not thinking it fit to trust so dreadfull a Man with Arms, who already unarmed, in a manner as he was, had made his City tremble, com∣manded him to be seized; whereat Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> grasping a Sword, for he had broke his own in the former Combate, stood upon his defence; and although they drew up the Bridge, and hemmed him in on every side, he killed fifty Knights before he could be taken: but then, weary with con∣tinual fighting, and his Sword breaking at the same time, he yielded to fatal necessity; and no sooner had the Infidels got him in their power, but they bound him in strong Chains, and carried him to the Dungeon, where by Cords they let him down a wonderfull depth: but long he had
<PB N="28" REF="15"/> not been there e'er the Dragons perceiving him, came out of the corners where they had made their Dens, with terrible Crys and Howlings, frighting even those that heard them from above, whereat Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> finding himself in a great strait, and ready to be devoured by those Mon∣sters, redoubling his force, he burst his Chains in sunder, and found as Fortune would have it, in the place where he lay, an old rusty Sword, with which, after a cruel fight, in which he received many Wounds from their Teeth and Claws, he killed the Dragons, and freed himself from the present danger, but suddenly fell into worse; for having nothing wherewith to subsist, unless the flesh of the Monsters he had slain, which were rank Poyson, he must inevitably perish for hunger; yet Death was not so terrible to him, as the thoughts he should disappoint Sir <HI>Sabre,</HI> and put his Mistriss in great sorrow, who yet knew no∣thing of his Vndertaking, and therefore might conclude he had forsaken her and proved false to his Vows. But whilst he was in this perplexi∣ty, his Keepers perceiving from above that he had destroyed the Dragons, advertized the King thereof, who, that he might prolong his Misery, in that noisom place, and make him, as it were, dye a living Death, com∣manded that every day he should have a Bowl of Bran and Water let down by Rope, with which, and the flesh of Rats and Mice, which he caught in the Dungeon, he subsisted for the space of seven years.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>How Sir <HI REND="blackletterType">Bevis</HI> killed his Keepers, and escaped from the Dungeon, where he had been seven years, and after that the Grooms, and furnished himself with Horse and Armour. How he killed a Knight and a Gyant. Stole fair <HI REND="blackletterType">Josian</HI> from King <HI REND="blackletterType">Iour,</HI> that had Married her, Conquered another Gyant, and two Lyons, and arrived at <HI REND="blackletterType">Colen:</HI> And what there befell him.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SIR <HI>Bevis</HI> being thus dead, in the conceit of the World, and the Princess <HI>Josian</HI> ignorant of what had befallen him, was given by her Father to understand that he had left the Court privately, and was gene for <HI>England,</HI> where he had married a Princess of great Renown, to whom he was formerly betrothed, and there lived upon his Possessions,
<PB N="29" REF="15"/> with an intention never to return; assuring her, that a Merchant had lately brought him this News; upon the recital whereof, the Royal Virgin wept abundantly, accusing him of Ingratitude and Inconstan∣cy, reviling the whole Sex for his sake, and vowing to live a Virgin, un∣less Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> returned, and she found what had been related of him false: however, her Father pressing her in this pensive and melancholly mood to comply with King <HI>Bradmound</HI>'s request, and become his Queen; and finding her altogether averse to him, he pitched upon ano∣ther, recommending him to her choice, <HI>viz. Jour</HI> King of <HI>Mambrat,</HI> a powerfull and wealthy Prince in those parts, and by threats and com∣mands, obliged her to joyn her hands with his, though not her Heart; for although many Emperors, Kings and Potentates were at the Wed∣ding, which was celebrated with exceeding Ioy and Pomp, she alone was found Sorrowfull, often retiring and weeping bitterly for the ab∣sence of Sir <HI>Bevis,</HI> by which she injured her fair Eyes, and much im∣paired her Beauty; and her Bedding, which is held the custome of those Countries, being deferred for a month, she, in that time, procured of the wise Magicians of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> then at her Father's Court, such Spells and Inchantments, that being worn, they, by secret power and ope∣ration, took away all desire in the King her Husband to bereave her of her Virginity; as shall be further mentioned hereafter.</P>
<P><HI>Bevis</HI>'s Horse, Sword and Armour being in the possession of King <HI>Ermine,</HI> he bestowed them upon his new Son-in-law, but <HI>Arundel,</HI> up∣on the first mounting of King <HI>Jour,</HI> perceiving it was not his true Master, taking a Career over Hedges, Ditches and Places of the like danger, threw him with such force, that the fall, by the mighty bruise, much indammaged his Life; which so vexed the King, that he caused him to be sent to his Castle and kept in Chains till he was starved to Death; but fair <HI>Josian,</HI> for the sake of his Master, daily fed him with her own hands, unknown to the King; and now began to mistrust, that there was some Treachery in the Case, forasmuch as she could not ima∣gine Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> would leave a Sword, Armour and Horse, he so intirely delighted in, when he might with the same case, as himself departed, have taken them with him: in which doubt we leave her a while, and return to Sir <HI>Bevis.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> still languishing in the noisome Dungeon, every day conti∣nued fervent Prayers to God, for the forgiveness of his Sins, and his deliverance from that dismal Place wherein he was; when for the most part his Keepers, who were Pagans, derided him with many
<PB N="30" REF="16"/> blasphemies, telling him it was in vain to expect deliverance, for none were able to deliver him out of their hands, and there he might assure himself he should remain till he dyed. When so one day it happened that Sir <HI>Bevis,</HI> to prevent the execrations of these Wretches against the Saviour of the World, resolved in silence to breath out his Heart-breathing sorrow, so that they, hearing no noise, concluded him dead, and thereupon one of them descended to see whether it was so or not, that they might take his Body thence, and drag it through the City, in derisi∣on of his Christian Profession, and so cast it in a Ditch, or on a Dung∣hill without the Walls, as is usual with them in that case; but he no sooner came down by a Rope, e'er Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> seized on him, and clapping his strong hands about his Neck, made him past crying out: at what
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> time the other Keeper calling to know whether Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> was dead or not, he himself answered in a feigned voice, assuring him he was dead, desiring him withall, to come down, and assist him in helping up the Bo∣dy; the other Keeper believing this to be true, immediately descended, but had scarcely reach'd the Ground when Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> with one blow of his
<PB N="31" REF="16"/> Fist broke his Neck in sunder; whereupon falling on his Knees, and giving thanks that he had thus avenged himself upon these Blasphemers and thereby wrought his own Liberty, he ascended by the Rope they had let down, and found it to be about the time of midnight, yet were there lights in the Stables, where the Grooms were dressing their Horses; and now resolving to mount and arm himself, he broke open the Door upon them, and with a Bar, to prevent their Out-crys, layed them in an everlasting sound: when taking one of the best Horses, with a Sword, Spear and compleat Armour, he mounted, and coming to the Gate where the Porter waited, told him, that Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> was escaped, and the Court was in pursuit of him, wherefore he must immediately open the Gate, which he, being ignorant of what had passed in the Dungeon and Stable, did with little difficulty, and let the Champion pass; but soon the Alarm was taken, and News brought to King <HI>Bradmound,</HI>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> that Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> had escaped, and killed his Keepers and the Grooms, whereat much enraged, he caused him to be pursued in all hast, when Sir <HI>Gran∣dures</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="17"/> a bold Knight, much relying upon his strength, mounted upon <HI>Trunchsice,</HI> a swift horse, and over-running all the rest, overtook him a con∣siderable distance from the City, and defyed him to the Combate, with many reproaches to which Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> replyed, That if he overcame him, Famine more befriended him than valour, yet both putting their Spears in their Rests, they ran furiously against each other, so that Sir <HI>Gran∣dures</HI> was tumbled to the Ground, yet rising and drawing his Sword he came at Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> who did the like, and after some blows were given and received, a full stroak, with redoubled force, falling upon his Helm clove it, with his Head, in sunder; whereupon Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> leaving him dead upon the ground, mounted <HI>Trunchsice,</HI> and passed on: but being weak through hunger, and perceiving a great Troop in pursuit of him, even at his Heels, dispairing to overcome so great a number, he took with his Horse, an Arm of the Sea, and swam to the further shoar, and by that means escaped, none daring to venture after him.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> having thus escaped his Foes, began now to faint, through hunger; and thereupon espying a Castle before him, and a beautifull La∣dy, leaning over the Wall, he made up to it, and acquainted her with his necessities, intreating her to supply him, with such Provision as she had, telling her he was a Christian Knight, who was upon the search of Adventures, and that if it say in his Power, he would require her kind∣ness, but she hearing he was a Christian, commanded him immediately to be gone, saying, That her Husband was a bloody Pagan Giant, and that if he knew he was there, he would suddenly come out and de∣stroy him, as he bone many; but this nothing daunted Sir <HI>Bevis,</HI> who rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yed he had rather dye in Battle than through hunger, and therefore he was resolved to Dine there that day: scarce had he ended these words but out came the Gyant, and stairing on him with a grim vissage, said, <HI>What art thou Fellow? and where camest thou by that Horse, which if I mistake not, is my Brother</HI> Grandure<HI>'s, whom thou hast stole? bu however, I shall chastize thee for thus sawcily approaching my Castle:</HI> and thereupon, e'er Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> could well reply, and give him an account, how he had gotten the Horse, he came at him with a h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and weighty Battle Ax, but missing him, he struck his Horse with such force that he f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lled him to the Ground; but Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> leaping nimb∣ly off, cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with such Fury, that he made the Giant give Ground; what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iring at a distance took his Bow that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng at the Wall, and shot at him with a forked Arrow, which entered his shoulder and greatly pain∣ed him, yet thereat being more inraged, he followed him up so close,
<PB N="33" REF="17"/> that with a forcible blow, between the Giants neck and shoulders, where his Helmet was open, he struck off his head, and his body thereupon falling to the ground made it tremble; at this the Lady screeched out, and would have fled to the Woods; but Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> promising to do her no harm, she was at last contented to stay, and set before him such provi∣sion as the Castle afforded; and then setting free such Prisoners as he fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd there, he departed to take a view of the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> where at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> he was kindly received by the Patriarch, and there he made a vow for the sake of fair <HI>Josian,</HI> never to marry any but a spotless Vir∣gin; and now considering it was too late for him to go for <HI>England,</HI> to be Sir <HI>Sabres</HI> Champion: and of which enterprise he had been defeated by the treachery of King <HI>Ermine,</HI> he resolved to go disguised into <HI>Arme∣nia,</HI> to know the cause why the King, who had so much deserved of him, had so perfidiously dealt with him? but the rather to know what was be∣come of the sair Princess? the disappointing of whom more sensibly grieved him, than all his other sufferings: and whilst he was musing on this matter, a Knight overtook him, who had been of his former ac∣quaintance, and related to him all that had passed on these occasions, further informing him, that Queen <HI>Josian</HI> though she was married a∣gainst her will, still kept him in remembrance, giving alms for his sake to a great number of Palmers, and enquiring of every one what was become of him. This did not a little revive the spirits of Sir <HI>Bevis,</HI> and put him upon a more earnest enquiry, especially where he might have a sight of his fair Mistris, and being informed she kept her Court in the Castle of <HI>Mambrat,</HI> he hasted thither.</P>
<P>Being arrived in the City and hearing the Queen gave alms to Pal∣mers, he put himself in such a weed, and leaving his horse and armour in his Inn, hasted to the Castle gate, and there amongst the rest passed for a Palmer; but long he had not staid there, before the Queen came with her Alms, the King and his Train being then gone a hunting, and when she had distributed her bounty, and gently enquired of every one, whether they had lately seen or heard of Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> of <HI>Southampton,</HI> but not meeting with any such news as she wished, she retired to her Closset, and in this manner bemoaned her self: Alas said she, for the good Knight Sir <HI>Bevis</HI>▪ he is gone and I shall never see him more; how could so brave a Knight be so much cruel, and unkind to a Virgin, that so highly esteemed and adore him; sure the best of men could never be guilty of the worst of crimes; it must surely then, be that some who envied our peace and happyness has conspired by treason to separate
<PB N="34" REF="18"/> us, though it cannot be in their power to extinguish my love towards him; for a Queen as I am, I would willingly be disrobed of my Royalty, to wander with that gallant Youth through Desarts or Wil∣dernesses, and think nothing too much to endure or suffer for his sake, whom I so dearly love; But O hard fortune, I shall never see him more! This said, she burst forth into a flood of tears; which Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> who had all this while hearkned under the window noting, could not but let fall some tears to bear hers company, and finding an opportunity to speak to <HI>Boniface</HI> her Page, he desired him to acquaint the Queen, that he had a secret to impart to her, that highly concern'd her welfare; which being accordingly done, she ordered he should at∣tend her coming down, in the retiring room, expecting from this Palmer, as most people usually do what they earnestly wish, some news of Sir <HI>Bevis.</HI></P>
<P>Long it was not before she came thither, when Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> after reve∣rence in a profound manner done, said, fair Queen, I hard you enquire this day for <HI>Bevis</HI> of <HI>Southampton,</HI> but not being wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling to speak the knowledge I have of that Knight in publick, I have presumed upon this private audience. And does he live, said the fair Queen, being al∣most extacied at the mention of his name: He does, replyed Sir <HI>Bevis,</HI> and for your sake, has undergone a thousand miseries, in a seven years imprisonment in a dungeon, and run many other hazards, though now all to no purpose, seeing you have for ever taken your self from him, by being given into the arms of another; And by whose contrivance, said the Queen, could he fall into such danger as you say? By the treachery of your Father, replyed Sir <HI>Bevis,</HI> who betrayed him to the power of King <HI>Bradmound,</HI> his mortal enemy. Is it possible, said the Queen, then all is true, that my fears sug∣gests, and I am wretched; with that she fell into a sound, but Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> taking her in his arms in the best wise comforted her, who there∣upon reviving, and knowing his voice, said, Ah and is it my Love, my life, my dear <HI>Bevis,</HI> and does he live! and here she had fainted again with too much excess of Ioy, had he not held her up, so that coming to her self, and having recounted to each other all that had happened, to cross their Loves: it was agreed between them, upon her declaring her self to be a pure Virgin, that the King being absent, he should take her thence to any land, where ever he pleased, and thereupon or∣dered at his request, her Page to fetch his Horse <HI>Arundel</HI> (who hear∣ing his Masters voice had broke his chains) his Sword <HI>Morglay,</HI> and
<PB N="35" REF="18"/> his Armour he left in the City, and to prepare her Equipage instant∣ly; which being all in a readiness they mounted, and mounting the Page, who would accompany his Queen, upon the Horse Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> left in the Inn, they with much joy and secrecy departed the City; but far had not they gone, but they perceived the Country in pursuit of them, upon notice the Queen was missing; whereupon Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> would have turned back, to have fought the pursuers, whilst the Queen and her Page, might have opportunity to escape; but she being as careful of his safety, as her own, would not consent; but rather those to make what speed they could out of the Territories of the King; and so succesful they were, that by passing through Forrests and By-ways, they lost the pursuers; but now night coming on, and the Queen being weary, and no house near, they were obliged to take up their lodging in a Rockey cave: But whilst Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> was gone in search of such provision as that wild place afforded, a Lyon and a Lyoness entred, it being it seems the place of their repose, to defend them against whom, <HI>Boniface</HI> the Queens Page drew his sword, and maintained a stout Combat, in hope Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> might in the mean time come to his rescue; but he not doing it, and the other proving too weak, was immediately devoured; but the Queen protected by her Royalty, as the Daughter of a King, and her unspotted Virginity remained safe; but no sooner Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> approached the Cave, but she cryed out to him to sly and save his life, giving him to understand the danger, and what else had happened, but his dauntless courage could not be afraid, for resolutely entring, as suspecting his fair Mistress in more danger than she was, he came upon them with such fury, that after a long Combat, not without receiving several gripes and wounds, he laid them dead at her feet; and by this he was further confirmed, that she had preserved her Virginity, notwithstanding she had been seaven years a Bride, and thereupon enquired with intermixtures of many tender kisses, by what means she had done it, who accordingly told him how it happened: and so having refreshed themselves with some Venison he had brought, which they roasted in the Cave, the fair Queen, such is the power of love condescending to took it. The next morning, when the Sun-beams began to dart from the East, they mounted and kept on their way; but as if fortune conspired to cross them, they at the turning of a Forrest, met a huge and mon∣strous Giant, whom King <HI>Jour</HI> had sent out to travel all night in search of them, who being satisfied he was right, by the discription
<PB N="36" REF="19"/> given, stradled cross the way like a Collossus, and with a mighty club in his hand forbad their passage further, saying he was not a little glad he had found them, that he might carry them bound on his back to <HI>Mambrat,</HI> there to be punished by King <HI>Jour</HI> as they deserved. But<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> nothing afraid of his stern vissage, that might reasonaby have affrighted any man, told him his business lay another way, and that if he did not instantly remove, he would cut his passage through him with his sword, at which the Giant in disdain set up a roar, that all the Forrest trembled, and came at Sir <HI>Bevis,</HI> who the better to avoid the force of the club, quitted his Horse, and nimbly traversing his ground, gave him many wounds, to revenge which, whilst he over∣reached himself, thinking with a full blow to dash Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> in peices, he stumbled and fell, nor could he by reason of his unweildiness, re∣cover till Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> was upon him, and being about to take off his head, he cryed out for quarter, promising all his life after to be his Ser∣vant, which at the intreaty of Queen <HI>Josian</HI> was granted, and <HI>Asca∣part,</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="19"/> for so was the Giants name, sworen to be true to the Conque∣ror, and thereupon they went to the next Port, where lay a ship rea∣dy to sail, but refusing to take them in, <HI>Ascapart,</HI> having obtained leave of Sir <HI>Bevis,</HI> seized upon the Vessel, and held it with a strong hand, in spite of sails, wind and oares, till by force he entred and drove the Sailors out of it, then taking Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> and the Queen in one arm, and his Horse in another, he carried them on board, his strength being almost incredible, for as the story has it, he was thirty foot in height and twelve in circumferance, so that mannaging by his sole strength the sails and tackle he transported them to <HI>Colen,</HI> where Queen <HI>Josian</HI> was baptized by the Bishop, and received into the Chri∣stian Communion, but <HI>Ascapart</HI> stradling quite over the Fount, and the peoples heads, that were near it, would not consent to it; but crying out, <HI>Ah Churl, wilt thou drench me, I am too big to be drenched by thee,</HI> and so departed.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>SIR <HI>Bevis</HI> being come to <HI>Colen,</HI> and the fame of his valiant deeds and glorious atchievements, having reached that place before, he was highly welcomed, and the people were overjoyed, for now they hoped by his prowess, to be delivered from the plague of their Country, which had destroyed so many of them, and layd many places wast, <HI>viz.</HI> a dreadful Dragon, who kept a Cave not far from the City, and that night had poisoned a Knight, whom many of the Inhabitants held invincible, and not to be conquered by mortal might; however at the cryes and intreaties of the Inhabitants, contrary to the knowledge of the Queen, who would not have suffered him to have undertaken so dangerous an enterprise, Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> and <HI>Ascapart</HI> went early in the morning to seek the Monster, and scarcely had they approached his

Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> growing more

'Tis true replyed the Bishop, and every year on a certain day they wage a mor∣tal Battle, wherein one or other of their party is slain: wherefore it is my opinion, that you ought to contend for it your self, as being the true Heir to the Earl your Father, and to further you in this matter, I promise to aid you with an hundred men at my own charge.</P>

<P>Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> glad of the profer made him by the Bishop, went to
<PB N="40" REF="21"/> <HI>Josian,</HI> and acquainted her with this new undertaking, laying before her the necessity of it, and withal told her he would leave her in that City sufficiently provided for, till the danger was over, and then fetch her in pomp, to possess their rightful heritage, and although she was unwilling to leave his company, and could not part without tears, yet seeing it must be so she consented, and so with a kind kiss for a time they bid a due to each other; for the men being shipped Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> went aboard, and within a while sailing came to an anchor, in a Port about two miles from <HI>Southampton,</HI> where Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> being destitute of Armour to furnish his men, thought of a stratagem to obtain it in this manner: <HI>viz.</HI> he sent a Knight to the Castle of Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> to inform him, that understanding there was a great difference between him and another Knight named Sir <HI>Sabre,</HI> and that a Battle was shortly to be fought between them, an <HI>Almain</HI> Captain with a Band of resolute Souldiers, was come to offer his service, provided he would furnish his men with Arms and Armour, that they might appear according to their quality, or else being Souldiers of Fortune, they were resolved to make the like offer to his Enemy, by whom they doubted not but to be entertained.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> kindly accepted this profer, upon the condition propo∣sed, and intreated them to land, which accordingly they did, and Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> with his men were highly treated, both by Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> and the Countess Sir <HI>Bevis</HI>'s Mother, who knew him not, for he had changed his name to that of Sir <HI>Gerard,</HI> ordering his men to call him by no other; when as Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> thus began, Noble Stranger, it may be you are ignorant of the cause that occasions this difference between me and Sir <HI>Sabre,</HI> a hardy Knight whose residence is now in the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> and this it is, so it happened, that Sir <HI>Guy</HI> being slain by misfortune in a neighbouring Forrest, who was Earl of this Town, I married the Lady his Countess my present Wife, and she having had one Son by the Earl named <HI>Bevis,</HI> who proving extravagant and expensive when of age I bought his Heritage of him, and he having consumed the mony he received for it, left the Land and has not since been heard of; notwithstanding this Sir <HI>Sabre</HI> who is his Vncle, being of late grown rich and powerful lays claim to it, and with many inroads and fierce Encounters disturbs and invades my pos∣session, and now I have informed you of the justness of my cause, I hope it will exault your Courages to defend my right.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> having heard the foregoing relation and knowing it to
<PB N="41" REF="21"/> be fabulous, had much ado to contain himself, and refrain from killing the murtherer of his Father, and the injurer of his Honour, in his own Castle; but considering it would be more generous, to do it in the field, he check'd at this time his anger, to wait a nobler opportunity, and so dissembling the matter, he renewed his request for Armour, Horses, and Shipping, protesting, if he might have them, to sail im∣mediately to the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> and there put an end to the contenti∣on, by making Sir <HI>Sabre</HI> his Prisoner, and bringing him bound to his presence. At this Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> was well pleased, and ordered all things to be provided according as had been desired, hastening them to the enterprise, who being accordingly furnished with what they desired, set sail and landed in the Island, at what time Sir <HI>Sabre</HI> being near the Shoar, and perceiving Ships putting men on land, supposed them Enemies, and thereupon sent for his forces to oppose them; but being convinced of the contrary, upon Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> causing his Fa∣thers Banner to be displayed, well known to him, and by that being assured it was his Nephew, he hasted to welcom him, and with much joy lead him to his Castle, and there they made report to each other, of all that had befel them since they parted; and thereupon Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> calling a Knight to him, and no longer desirous to to dissemble who he was, or refrain laying claim to his Heritage, sent him to Sir <HI>Murdure,</HI> to let him know how he had been mistaken and imposed up∣on, and that he immediately expected a surrender of the Earldom; and would notwithstanding punish him for treacherously killing his Father: when the Messenger came with this message, Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> was at dinner with divers Friends, making great merriment, as not doubting by the help of his supposed Friends, to be revenged on Sir <HI>Sabre</HI> his mortal Enemy; but upon the delivery of the message, finding himself deceived in his expectation, he grew exceeding wrath, and drawing his Daggar, being on the other side of the Tabe, he threw it with great force at the Knight, but missing him, it struck into the breast of his own Son, who was then waiting at the borad, whereupon he fell down dead, and the other fled, relating all that he had said and seen, to Sir <HI>Bevis,</HI> who gave him for this ser∣vice forty pounds.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How Sir <HI REND="blackletterType">Bevis</HI> and Sir <HI REND="blackletterType">Murdure</HI> prepared for War. How <HI REND="blackletterType">Josian</HI> had like to have been Ravished; and how she was rescued from the Flames, and brought together with the Gyant <HI REND="blackletterType">Ascapart,</HI> to the Isle of <HI REND="blackletterType">Weight:</HI> and what other matters happened.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SIR <HI>Bevis,</HI> as we said, being in the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> we must there leave him a while, and return to <HI>Josian</HI> whom we left at <HI>Colen,</HI> and with her the Giant <HI>Ascapart</HI> as her Guard, to prevent any danger that might befall her. So it fell out, That <HI>Josian</HI> had not been long here, after the departure of Sir <HI>Bevis,</HI> but Sir <HI>Miles</HI> an Earl of that Country, casting his Eyes upon her admirable Beauty, fell desperately in love with her, and began in a passionate manner, to court her to his pleasure, but she refusing his proffer'd Love with disdain, he resolved if he could not have his Will of her fairly, to have it by force, and in a manner told her his intent, to which she replied, Sir, although Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> is absent, yet have I here with me <HI>Ascapart,</HI> that will not see me wronged: and by this means, he ha∣ving understood in whom she reposed her confidence, resolved to get him out of the way, whilst he acted his wicked purpose, and so feign∣ing a Letter to him, in Sir <HI>Bevis</HI>'s name, how that he must im∣mediately come to him, to the Castle in the Sea, standing a league from the Shoar; the unthinking Giant went, when he no sooner entred the Castle, but it was shut upon him, by those that carried him, and the boat, as Sir <HI>Miles</HI> had agreed with the Boatmen, im∣mediately rowed back again; and then he made his fresh attempts up∣on fair <HI>Josian,</HI> telling her what he had done with <HI>Ascapart,</HI> and now she had nothing to hope in, but must yield to his pleasure or dye; whereupon she secretly sent a trusty Messenger, to certifie Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> of the dan∣ger she was in, which required his speedy aid: and then to delay the false Knight, she told him, if he would marry her, he should have his will of her, but if he otherways attempted it, she would rather dye than suffer it to be done.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Miles,</HI> as I said, being passionately in love with the fair Queen, stuck not at any thing she proposed, so that he might enjoy her, and having
<PB N="43" REF="22"/> told her he would asuredly do it, and thereupon obtaining a kiss, the day was appointed, to be the next, and thereupon he prepared all manner of sumptuous Chear and Musick, inviting many Barrons, Knights, and Ladies to his wedding, and so married they were early in the morning, and the day being spent in feasting; when it grew night and Supper ended, fair <HI>Josian</HI> was led to her Bride-Chamber, and soon after, impatient of delay, came Sir <HI>Miles</HI> with many atten∣dants, but she intreated him for modesties sake to send away his Train, and she would be his Chamberlain; so that at his command all departing, and they left together, she finding now no other way to save her honour, made a slip-knot of her Girdle and casting it over his Neck, strangled him, and afterward hung him upon a beam. And his Barrons and Knights finding him not abroad in the Morn∣ing, as he was wont, imputing it to his new Love Incounters with the fair Bride, every one wishing himself in his place; some went to hunting, and others to the Church; but coming home at noon, and yet not finding him out of his Chamber, they had great marvel, insomuch that one of them went to see what was the matter, and open∣ing the door, said, <HI>Arise Earl</HI> Miles, <HI>for you have slept a great while, wherefore I cannot but think your head akes, will you please to have a Candle? Nay,</HI> replyed Iosian, <HI>I will undertake his Head shall ake no more, for I have unknit the wedding, and yonder you may see him hanging, my honour he shall never destroy, though for what I have acted, you may do with me as you please.</HI></P>
<P>The death of Sir <HI>Miles</HI> once known to his Friends, they made great sorrow for it, and with much anger proceeded to burn the fair <HI>Josian</HI> at a stake, so that the Fire being set in order, and kindled by the Sea side, <HI>Ascapart,</HI> who beheld it from the Castle, imagining that Queen <HI>Josian</HI> his Mistris was in danger burst in sunder the Iron gates, and entring a Fishers boate, just come into the Port, he rowed himself to the place where the Fire was, and found it to be true, as he had dread, for there he beheld the Queen in her shift, ready to be put into the fire, and whilst he was devising how to rescue her, Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> came riding up, and seeing <HI>Ascapart,</HI> said, Thief where has thou been? where has thou left <HI>Josian</HI> my fair Queen, whom I gave thee in charge, that she is thus forced to send for me to de∣liver her from danger? whereupon asking his pardon, he told him all that had happened, and shewed him in what danger the Queen stood, who had before their coming been sacraficed in the Flames, had
<PB N="44" REF="23"/> not the Priest been long in shrieving her. This sight so enraged Sir <HI>Bevis,</HI> that bidding <HI>Ascapart</HI> follow him, he broke through the throng, and with his Sword cut all in pieces before him, in so much that the people fled amazed, crying on every hand for mercy, whilst <HI>Ascapart</HI> on the other side, laid them on heaps with his Club, felling and braining whole ranks at a blow, and having made great slaugther and cleared the Coast, <HI>Josian</HI> being left alone, Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> caused her to cloath her self, and mount behind him, and together with <HI>Ascapart</HI> they took shipping, and sailed to the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> where they were lovingly receeived by Sir <HI>Sabre,</HI> and his Knights. <HI>Josian</HI> returning great thanks to Heaven for her deliverance, and there related to Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> all that had befell her, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>SIR <HI>Bevis</HI> and Sir <HI>Sabre,</HI> resolving to pursue Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> to death, sent their summons into all parts, to require their Friends to come to their Aid, sending, the better to encourage them, gifts of Gold and Silver very liberally, so that many Earls, Barrons, and Knights came slocking to their Standard, with their Pages, and their Attendants, who according to their Degrees were listed, and entred into the Service; of which Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> having notice, was exceeding∣ly fretted in his mind, and therefore consulted with the Countess his Wife, what was best to be done for their safeties, who advised him to send to his Brother the Emperour, and she would do the like to her Father the King of <HI>Scots,</HI> to let them know their distress, and re∣require their speedy Aid, which she doubted not to obtain, with many more Knights of Renown, in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> and then like a Tempest falling upon <HI>Bevis, Sabre</HI> and their Fellows, you may soon
<PB N="45" REF="23"/> put them to the slight, wherefore, said she, in no manner let your Courage fall you.</P>
<P>This Council Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> immediately put in practice, nor did he fail therein; for a great many came dayly to him, and amongst the rest the King of <HI>Scots,</HI> with five thousand choice Souldiers; and Sir <HI>Morris</HI> of <HI>Vain,</HI> sent by the <HI>Almain</HI> Emperor, with four thousand men<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> at Arms, he having three thousand under his Banner before, where∣upon, gathering them in one place, he said, Lordlings, you that are come to my Aid, have no doubt heard of the strife between me and Sir <HI>Sabre,</HI> and now another is entred into the Quarrel, to take part with him, one Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> by name, threatning to slay me, and to take away my Land, and Possessions, and for that intent, has brought with him a monsterous Giant, whose grim visage may at first per∣haps terrifie some, but being well armed, and more in number than they, I doubt not, but we shall so deal with them as to make them re∣pent their rash undertaking. This said, he commanded all the Hoast
<PB N="46" REF="24"/> to arm and go aboard the Ships he had prepared, resolving to assail Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> and Sir <HI>Sabre,</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> hoping, there by his sudden coming, to surprise them at unawares, but scarce were they be∣ginning to lan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, before Sir <HI>Sabre</HI> from the Castle espyed them, and informed Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> of their arrival, telling him he had never seen so great a Hoast in those p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ts; to which Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> replyed, that their member mattered not, though they were ten to one, seeing they were in a wrong cause, and therefore resolving to give them battle; he di∣vided his Hoast, reducing three thousand under his own Banner and Loading, and three thousand he put under the commmand of Sir <HI>Sa∣bre,</HI> leaving <HI>Ascapart</HI> with three thousand more to guard the Castle, and succour them if there should be need; saying, that so many fresh men would stand him in great stead, when the battle was at the hight, and so caused a march to be sounded; which Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> understand∣ing, incouraged his Men and set them in order, making of them three Battles; the first he led himself, the second was commanded by the King of <HI>Scots,</HI> and the third by Sir <HI>Morris</HI> of <HI>Vain,</HI> each consisting of ten thousand men, which they had by the way, encreased to the for∣mer number; and then both Armies facing a while, and the Generals encouraging their Men, the bloody blast was sounded, whereupon Sir <HI>Morris de Vain</HI> ran against Sir <HI>Sabre</HI> with great fury, so that their Lances shivering they drew their Swords, and began a dreaful fight, but after many wounds on either part, Sir <HI>Morris</HI> was beaten from his Horse as dead, and there had been slain, had not his Men from all parts pressed furiously to rescue him: whilst this was doing Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> pressed on, killing many on either hand, till he broke through where the King of <HI>Scots</HI> fought; who seeing him come in that despe∣rate manner, prepared to receive him; but after a hot dispute between them, the King was unhorsed, and his Helm burst in sunder, where∣upon crying out for succour, his Men from all parts thrust despe∣rately, between Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> and him, and were there a great number of them slain, insomuch that the heaps of dead bodies, stoped the way of the Conqueror.</P>
<P>Soon after the King was beaten down, he retired out of the battle to refresh himself, and having put on fresh Armour, and remounted he came again with great fury to the Fight; so that great slaughter ensued, and Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> still ranging through the Battle making horrible destruction whereever he came, advanced so far that he broke into the press where Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> had slain and unhorsed many, saying Trai∣tor,
<PB N="47" REF="24"/> Let those alone and turn thee hither, but Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> seeing it was Sir <HI>Bevis,</HI> who had vowed his death, he used many endeavours to shun the fight; but Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> pressing on, and thinking to give him a forcible blow, thereby to dispatch him at once, he by swiftly turning his Horse avoided it, yet the Sword falling on his Horse, clove his crupper in sunder, so that he fell down dead, but Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> was remounted by his Men, and a while made resistance, but finding him∣self to weak for his adversary, he retyred within the ranks of his Men, and left them to the fury of Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> who mounted on <HI>Arundel</HI> his Steed, laid about him on every side, with his trusty Sword <HI>Morglay,</HI> nor did his Horse fail with his heels and teeth to fight couragiously, giving to many their mortal wounds; so that the Plain whereon they fought, blshed with blood, and was covered with dead bodies, so that the num∣ber of his Enemies was lessened: and at the signal given <HI>Ascapart</HI> advanced with his men on foot, for by reason of his monsterous size no Horse could bear him, and with his huge Club overthrew whole Squa∣drons, in so much that he drove a thousand men before him, like a flock of Sheep to the Sea-side, who fearing a worser death, leaped into the waves, and were most of them drowned; but a very few getting to the Ships, that lay at Anchor in the Road; and then returning where his Men fought, he broke through the main Battle of <HI>Scots,</HI> and car∣ried all before him, making lanes whereever he came, till he arrived where Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> was fighting, and had done wonders.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> no sooner beheld <HI>Ascapart,</HI> but calling him to him, said, Mark well the person that fights on younder Steed, and be sure you let him not escape our hands, for that is Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> the causer of all this mischief; whereupon <HI>Ascapart</HI> in all haste made thitherward, and when Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> would have fled from him, he caught him in his Arms, Horse and Man, and bore him, in spite of the resistance that was made, into the Castle; and now Sir <HI>Morris</HI> being slain by Sir <HI>Sabre,</HI> and the King of <HI>Scots</HI> being no longer able to maintain the Battle, the Souldiers fled on all parts; which the King perceiving and not being able to restraine the Flight fled likewse, and getting into a Ship, prepared for that purpose, he sailed away Westward to a stronge Castle of his in the Sea. And now Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> being in the Castle, he was condemned to be put into a Cauldron of scalding Pitch and Brimstone, where he miserably perished; and this he had as a punishment for the murther of Sir <HI>Guy</HI> Father to Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> and Earl of <HI>Southampton;</HI> of which the Countess his Wife being in∣formed,

<P>BEing thus rid of of his mortal Enemies, Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> and his no∣bles Companions, took leave of the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> and sailed to <HI>Southampton,</HI> where finding his Mother dead, by the means aforesaid, he caused her notwithstanding, to be honourably buryed; and so took
<PB N="49" REF="25"/> possession of his Castle, and Heritage, and sending for the Bishop of <HI>Colen,</HI> and many other noble Personages, he was by the said Bishop, married to his beloved Queen <HI>Josian,</HI> and never was Queen so wil∣ling to be disrobed of her Royalty, nor Knight so pleased with a Queen; and soon after going to <HI>London,</HI> to do homage to King <HI>Ed∣gar</HI> for his Earldom, and having told him his name, and by what right he claymed that Heritage, the King made him Marshal of <HI>En∣gland,</HI> delivering the staff that his Father Sir <HI>Guy</HI> had before him: so that returning home he was highly esteemed and honoured by King, Peers and Pesants spending his estate liberally and in giving Alms re∣membring from his 7 years imprisonment what it was to suffer hunger.</P>
<P>Yet growing great in Offices and places of honourable trust, he at last stirred up the envy of one Sir <HI>Brian</HI> of <HI>Cornwal</HI> against him, as having some of the Offices bestowed upon him by the King; that were formerly his; so that about <HI>Whitsontide</HI> when sundry Knights were coursing and raceing on their gallant Steeds, forty pounds in gold was proposed for a three mile Course, on the Horse that run best; when Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> being present and knowing none might compare to <HI>Arundel,</HI> he undertook in honour of the day to ride with the rest, and although two Knights having unexpectedly the start were got half a mile before, Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> gave <HI>Arundel</HI> the reins, who flew forth like the wind, and immediately overtook them, and passing by, was at the Races end before they could imagine he was gotten two miles, which made the Kings Son so much in love with the Horse for his goodness, and for whose sake, as the story says, Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> built the Castle of <HI>Arundel,</HI> calling it after his Horses name, that he de∣sired at any rate to have him, but Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> required of him to ask any thing else and he should freely have it, yet as for his Horse no Gold, nor Castles, nor Towns, nor Favour could assure him to part with him, upon which the Prince w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tching his opportunity, resolved to take him by force out of the stable, but as he attempted to do it, <HI>Arundel</HI> knowing it was not his Master, lifted up his Heels, and gave him such a blow on the Head that his brains slew out.</P>
<P>When King <HI>Edgard</HI> heard his own Son was slain, and the man∣ner how, he was exceeding wrath, and assembling his Councel, pro∣posed to them, that since Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> his denying his Horse to his Son, had made him attempt what occasioned his death, it was sit that he should dye for it a cruel death, urging that he might be drawn to pieces with wild Horses; but his Councel declared they could pass
<PB N="50" REF="26"/> no such sentence upon him, seeing he no hand in the death of the Prince. But Sir <HI>Brian</HI> of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> resolving to do him a displea∣sure, starting up, said, <HI>Though they could not indeed meddle with Sir</HI> Bevis <HI>for this matter, yet the Horse ought to be slain;</HI> which was agreed on all hands: whereupon Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> humbly besought the King, that rather than he should loose his Horse, he would permit him to abjure the Land, which being granted, he surrendred up his Offices and places of Honour, which was that which Sir <HI>Brian</HI> aimed at, and made over his Lordships and Heritage to his Vncle Sir <HI>Sabre;</HI> and so with <HI>Josian</HI> Sir <HI>Terre</HI> and <HI>Ascapart,</HI> he took his leave of <HI>England,</HI> and from this time <HI>Ascapart</HI> ploted how he might bring it about to seize <HI>Josian,</HI> and carry her back to King <HI>Jour,</HI> of which more hereafter.</P>

<PB N="51" REF="26"/> great reward and honour; so that when Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> and Sir <HI>Terrey</HI> returned, they found only the Children in the Bower, and perceiving <HI>Ascapart</HI> gone, they easily guessed at what had befallen, and made great sorrow for this loss, but finding it no boot to stay there Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> wrapped up the Children in a rich mantle their Mother had left behind her, and passing on met a man, of whom they inquirid, if he saw not a Giant carrying a Lady that way, who answered he did not; then said Sir <HI>Bevis,</HI> what is your business? he replied, I am a Forrester, then will you, said he, take home with you this Child, and cause it to be christened by the name <HI>Guy,</HI> and here is ten marks in hand, and when you have kept it seaven years, inquire for one <HI>Be∣vis</HI> of <HI>Southampton,</HI> and bring it to him, and you shall have store of Gold for so doing: The man upon these conditions, having gladly re∣ceived the Infant, Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> and Sir <HI>Terry</HI> passed on, and meeting with a Fisher-man, disposed of the other in the same sort, directing his name to be <HI>Miles.</HI></P>
<P>Long these Champions rid together, yet could they get no sight nor tidings of <HI>Ascapart,</HI> who went through Woods and By-ways to pre∣vent discovery, nor rested they till they entred a fair Town, and there betook themselves to an Inn to rest; but long they had not been there, er'e looking out at the Window, they saw a gallant Train of Horse-men, exceedinly well mounted on Horses with rich Trappings, and Heralds on every side displaying their Arms and Banners, which made them enquire of their Host, the occasion of so great a concourse, who told them that on the morrow there would be held a great Iusting in that Town, for a fair Virgin, Daughter to the Duke, who being old and not expecting long to live, for the honour he bears to Arms, has set her the prize, and with her, all his Lands and Possessions after his death, of his valour who can win her, by carrying the day from the rest of the Knights, Earls, Dukes and Barrons.</P>
<P>For this news, the English Champions gave him a Reward, and agreed between themselves, to be ready to enter the List early in the morning; when in the mean time Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> for the device on his Sheild, prepared a Lyon Rampant in a Field Gules, and Sir <HI>Terry</HI> a Vnicorn in a Field Argent, that they might the better be known, and noted by the Lady, during the Conevat, whose name was <HI>Elinor the Fair.</HI> No sooner had the Sun given light to the World, but the Trumpets florished round, and whon the Ladies had taken their
<PB N="52" REF="27"/> places, the Knights came forth to Iust: when the Emperor of <HI>Al∣mains</HI> Son advancing, Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> met him so forcibly, that he bore both horse and man to the ground; uyon which the Earl of <HI>Florence</HI> came against him, but Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> with his spear struck him so hard, in the middle of his shield, that he made him fly from off his horse two yards and upwards; when Duke <HI>Anthony</HI> resolving to revenge<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> his cause, advanced with great fury, bidding Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> turn to him, for he was resolved to revenge the Duke of <HI>Florence</HI>'s disgrace, so together they rod with much fury, but the Duke was soon unhorsed, and laid upon the ground, having his shoulder bone broke with the thrust: Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> having thus far proceeded, Sir <HI>Terry</HI> advanced against the King of <HI>Hungary</HI>'s Brother, and bore him from his Horse, and did the like to the Earl <HI>Hamant,</HI> who came to second him, and so well they dealt, that none was able to stand before them; so that the Iudges of the Field gave Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> the first plaee, and Sir <HI>Ter∣rey</HI> the second in valour; and being come to Court, the Lady met Sir <HI>Bevis,</HI> and taking him by the hand, said, I am, Sir Knight,
<PB N="53" REF="27"/> your own, you have fairly won me in the Field, and may wed me when you please; Nay, Madam, said Sir <HI>Bevis,</HI> I have a Lady already, though at present I have lost her, and am now in search of her, but my noble Friend is destitute of a Wife, and to him I re∣commend your choice: To that, said she, I agree if in seaven years time you find your Wife, but if not, that then you will swear to wed me, and so long or till you have found her, I will for your sake con∣tinue a Virgin, this being agreed on, they left the Court in search of fair <HI>Josian.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Sabre</HI> being now at home, in possession of great Fortunes, happened on a night to dream, that Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> was much distressed, through the means of <HI>Ascapart</HI> the Giants treachery, and telling his dream to his Wife, she advised him to go in search of his Ne∣phew; and thereupon taking twelve Knights with him in Palmers weeds, though under them they were well armed, he crossed the Seas and having passed through many Lands, as he approached <HI>Mambra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> he espyed the Gyant haling fair <HI>Josian,</HI> who cryed out pitiously to him and his Companions for help, as knowing that if she was de∣livered to first her Husband, he would put her to death, and thereupon Sir <HI>Sabre</HI> and his Knights commanded him to let her go, but he sternly refusing it, they assailed him on all sides; whereupon quitting her bound as she was, and therefore incapable of flying away, he be∣took himself to his Club, and laid at the Knights with great fury, but they being nimble, still avoided his blows, and in the end having tired him, Sir <HI>Sabre</HI> whilst the others maintained the sight, stepped in, and with his sword run him through, so that he fell dead to the ground; where leaving him, he lead <HI>Josian</HI> to the next Inn, and there with a certain oyntment, discoloured her fair face that she might not be known, but having spent all their mony and provision, they went to require a supply, at a Castle where Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> and Sir <HI>Terrey</HI> were lodged, when Sir <HI>Terrey</HI> coming to the gate knew his Father and lead him in with great joy, nor was Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> a little glad when he heard <HI>Josian</HI> was recovered; whereupon Sir <HI>Terrey</HI> proceeded as it had been agreed, to wed the fair <HI>Elinor,</HI> which was done with great feasting, pomp, and splendor, and her Father soon after dying, he possessed himself of all the Estate.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>KING <HI>Jour,</HI> having a long time in vain expected his Wife, resolved to greive for her no more, but to be revenged on her Fa∣ther, and thereupon made war on his Countries, of which Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> receiving inteelligence by a Palmer, gathered a great Company, and leaving Sir <HI>Terrey</HI> with his new Wife, took with him Sir <HI>Sabre,</HI> and his two Sons <HI>Guy</HI> and <HI>Miles,</HI> who were grown by this time to perfection, resolving to assist his Father-in-Law, of whose coming King <HI>Ermine</HI> was exceeding glad, and humbly beged his pardon, of∣fering to make him amends, for the injury he had done him, to be Christened with all his people, whereupon Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> sent to <HI>England</HI> for Clergy-men, who instantly came and performed that good Office: Yet King <HI>Jour</HI> drawing near with twenty thousand <HI>Sarazens,</HI> destroy∣ing the Countrey before him, Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> being made General of <HI>Ar¦mony,</HI> raised an Army likewise to meet him, and defying each other∣in a plain field, a dreadful battle began; whereupon Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> and his Knights so laid about them, that they overthrew and cut in pieces whole Ranks of men, and grew at length so terrible, that where ever they came, the enemies fled before them, when coming to King <HI>Jour</HI> he beat him from his Horse, and there had slain him, had not a Troop of fresh men instantly come in to his Rescue, sacrificing their lives to defend him, who no longer trusting to his forces, see∣ing the day was lost, betook himself to flight, and was followed by such of his men, who escaped the sword, yet Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> pursued so hard after him, upon his swift Horse <HI>Arundle,</HI> that he overtook him, and made him his prisoner, having soon after for his Ransome, twenty tuns of Gold, three hundred Bales of Silk, and as many white Steeds, with three hundred Cups of Gold and Silver, making him at the same time ever quit claim to the fair <HI>Josian,</HI> and to be in per∣petual Amity with King <HI>Ermine.</HI></P>
<PB N="55" REF="28"/>
<P>For this and other great services, King <HI>Ermine</HI> offered to give him his Crown; and the Government of this Kingdom, but he refused it, yet accepted it for <HI>Guy</HI> his eldest Son, who was solemnly crowned King of <HI>Armony,</HI> and the old King not long after died; upon which King <HI>Jour</HI> fretted at his disgrace, resolved again to invade the Countrey, and thereupon thinking Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> did these wonders, through the strength of his Horse, he resolved to get him by fraud, and sent on <HI>Robion</HI> a cunning fellow to steal him out of the stable, who charming his keepers, as also the Horse with spells and sleeping drenches brought him away: But scarcely had he reached <HI>Mambrat</HI> with him, before Sir <HI>Sabre</HI> espied him, and leaping up behind him, felled him dead with the truncheon of a spear, but er'e he could<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> get away, the <HI>Sarrazens,</HI> that had beheld what was done, came running and assailed him on every part, and although he valiantly defended himself- they hardly put him to it, which <HI>Josian</HI> having perceived from the Turret of a Castle, advertised Sir <HI>Bevis,</HI> who
<PB N="56" REF="29"/> with other Knights hasted to his aid, and slew the <HI>Sarrazens</HI> in great number, so that happy was he, that could first recover the City. This made King <HI>Jour</HI> exceeding wrath, and immediately to send to his Brother <HI>Bradwin</HI> to come to his succor, who was King of <HI>Surry,</HI> making at the same time great sacrifices, offers and vows to <HI>Maho∣met</HI> for his success; and thereupon King <HI>Jour</HI> grown desperate, re∣solved to end the strife, by single Combate with Sir <HI>Bevis,</HI> and ad∣vancing for that purpose towards <HI>Armony</HI> with three thousand men, he desied him, telling him that having slain his Men, bereaved him of his Wife, and done him other mischiefs, he would now try it out with him to wreck his own revenge; and if it so fell out, that he slew him, he would possess himself of the Land of <HI>Armony;</HI> but if himself was slain, <HI>Mambrat</HI> should be delivered to Sir <HI>Bevis:</HI> These Conditions agreed on, and sworn to on either part, they went into a little Island to fight the Combat, and there drawing their Swords, they furiously laid at each other, the one animated by dispair, and the other by true valour; but after many wounds given and received, Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> with a forcible blow, burst King <HI>Jour</HI>'s Helmet in sunder, cutting through his Shield, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as he held it up to defend him∣self; so that he brought him to the ground both horse and man: but the King nimbly got up again, and calling upon <HI>Mahomet</HI> for suc∣cor, began the fight anew, at which Sir <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evis</HI> alighted to be upon e∣qual terms, and with another stroak felled him again; so that now he had him at his mercey, whose life he notwithstanding spared, yet sent him to a strong Castle, and doomd him a prisoner for his life, when taking his Armour and Ensigns of Royalty, he went with a good Company of Souldiers to <HI>Mambrat,</HI> where the Citizens sup∣posing him to be their King, immediately opened their Gates; so that entring with his men, he soon made himself Master of it, put∣ting all that resisted to the sword, and obliged the rest to abjure their Mahumitisme causing himself there to be crowned, by which Queen <HI>Josian</HI> was twice Queen of <HI>Mambrat.</HI></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How Sir <HI REND="blackletterType">Sabrey</HI>'s Heritage being taken away, he came with Sir <HI REND="blackletterType">Bevis</HI> to recover it; and how the later maintained a great Battle in <HI REND="blackletterType">London,</HI> wherein he killed Sir <HI REND="blackletterType">Brian</HI> of <HI REND="blackletterType">Cornwel,</HI> his mortal Ene∣my; and how he was restored to the Kings Favour, and Sir <HI REND="blackletterType">Sabre</HI> to his Land.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SIR <HI>Sabre</HI> being now with Sir <HI>Bevis,</HI> as they rod forth a hawking on a day, news was brought him, that King <HI>Edgar</HI> had seized on his Inheritance by the advice of Sir <HI>Brian</HI> of <HI>Cornwal</HI> his Steward, and turned out his Wife and Children, of which he had no sooner notice, but he asked Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> leave to depart for <HI>En∣gland;</HI> but he would not suffer him to go alone, promising to accom∣pany him, and his Son, with his Queen and his two Sons, and many courageous Knights, when landing at <HI>Southampton,</HI> he raised a great power of his Friends, and marched towards <HI>London,</HI> where the King was; then Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> leaving his Army at <HI>Putney,</HI> went with twenty Knights only to waite upon the King, and having ad∣mittance to his presence, after Reverence done, desired to know, Why Sir <HI>Sabre</HI>'s Estate had been seised? to whom the King re∣plyed, It was done at the instance of Sir <HI>Brian</HI> his Stward, but however he had since bethought himself, and would soon restore it; but Sir <HI>Brian</HI> being present, boldly started up and said, it ought not to be done, saying moreover to Sir <HI>Bevis,</HI> that he wondred how he durst, being a banished man, return, and that for his presumption he ought to be hanged, or put to some other shameful death; to this Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> replyed neither good nor bad, but making his Reverence to the King, departed. But the revengeful Steward not so satis∣fied, knowing where he inn'd with his Knights, caused the City-Gates to be locked, and the Chains to be drawn cross the streets, and raised a Cry at midnight, that every one who could bear Arms, should assault Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> in his Lodging, to revenge the death of the Kings Son slain by his Horse <HI>Arundel,</HI> of which treachery Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> having notier, ordered his Squire to hasten his Sons to his aid with the Army, and thereupon mounting <HI>Arundel,</HI> he met Sir
<PB N="58" REF="30"/> <HI>Brian</HI> at the head of the people he had raised; and said to him, come on now, you are an old Knight of War, and so they run upon each other, but Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> missing with his Spear, Sir <HI>Brian</HI> run him quite<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> through the Shield, and clove it in sunder, which so much ang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed him, that drawing his Sword <HI>Morglay,</HI> he smote him with a down right stroak, and clove his Honnet and head in sunder, and charging upon his men made a great slaughter of them, insomuch that the streets ran with blood, and so passing on to <HI>Broad-street,</HI> he met di∣vers <HI>Lumbards,</HI> that came to assail him, but soon scattered and di∣spersed them, whilst his other Knights were not idle, but made a great slaughter and havock of the Multitude; yet finding themselves hard beser, they made towards <HI>Ludgate,</HI> to possess themselves of it, but found it shut and gaurded, whereat Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> commanded them to open it, and let him out, who refusing to do it, a great fight was be∣gun anew, and so well Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> behaved himself that he brought six hundred men to the ground, without receiving a wound himself.</P>
<PB N="59" REF="30"/>
<P>The news of Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> his danger coming to the ear of his Wife and Sons, the former fell in a sound, but the two later raised and revived her, telling her they would bring him speedy aid, resolving if they found him slain, to destroy and lay wast the City, and so mount∣ing, they led their Hoast by great marches, and not only found their Father alive, but manfully defending himself, yet exceeding weary with so great a toil and blood-shed, at what time more Citizens came to the aid of their Fellows under the leading of a stout Lumbard and strong, who charged Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> with great fury, but sped no better than Sir <HI>Brian</HI> of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> for with the first stroak Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> gave him he severed his head from his shoulders, and now Sir <HI>Sabre, Guy</HI> and <HI>Miles</HI> laying furiously about them, the Citizens fled in great disorder, and shut themselves up, as many as could, in their own Houses and in Bulwarks then built to defend the Walls; and some fled to the King, who then kept his Court in the Tower, whereupon Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> had the intire-possession of the City; yet would he not use any violence to those that resisted him not, nor suffer his Sons, who in the hear of their youthful blood purposed, to seek and fire the City, but immediately causing a Retreat to be sounded, he with∣drew his Forces and retired to <HI>Southampton,</HI> where he took possession of his Estate, sending to the King to excuse what had been done on his part with the manner how it fell out; so that the fault being alto∣gether laid upon Sir <HI>Brian,</HI> who was now dead, the King was no ways offended with Sir <HI>Bevis,</HI> but confirmed him and Sir <HI>Sabre</HI> in their Estates, honouring them with many Offices and Dignities, counting especially their Friendship above all others.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>SIR <HI>Bevis</HI> and his Confederates, being now in peace and tranqui∣lity, King <HI>Edgar</HI> sent for them to his Court, upon a great Feast he made for his Nobles, and entertained them with much splendor, and a Tilt and Tournament for their fvrther Recreation being pre∣pared, <HI>Guy</HI> and <HI>Miles</HI> Sir <HI>Bevis</HI>'s two Sons maintained it against all strangers or other Knights of the Court, and were so highly suc∣cesful, that they unhorses all that came against them: Insomuch that Sir <HI>Guy</HI> being then in silver Armor, with a fair Lady portrayed on his Shield, the beautiful <HI>Lyndamira</HI> Daughter to the King, took such norice of his manly form, proportion of Body and rare atchieve∣ments beyond, in a manner, the strength of man, that she fell despe∣rately in love with him, of which the young Knight being ignorant, and the Princess through excess of Modesty, not willing to discover it to any, she fell sick and in a languishing condition, whereat the King being greatly grieved, sent for his Physicians, from all parts of the Land to cure her Malady, who soon found it proceeded from a cause beyond the power of their Art; and enformed the King, that distemper of the fair Princess, proceeded from love, who tender of this his only Daughter, pressed her in all Fatherly mildness to let him know the object that occasioned it, which at first she began with mo∣desty to refuse, or rather excuse. but the King being earnest herein, she amidst sighs, blushes and much confusion, told him it was Sir <HI>Guy.</HI></P>
<P>The King knowing the cause of his fair <HI>Lindamira's</HI> sickness, he made it his business to apply the cure, and thereupon sent for Sir <HI>Guy,</HI> and in plain terms told him what happiness was designed him, and how much his Daughter suffered for his sake: The young Knight, though inwardly overjoyed at this news, being no less in love than she, strove at first to excuse it, alleadging he was unworthy of so
<PB N="61" REF="31"/> great an honour, yet in the end, submitted to be wholly disposed off at the Kings pleasure, who caused them to be married to their great joy, and mutual satisfaction, the wedding being kept with much pomp<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> and splendor, and graced with a concourse of the Nobility, where many noble seats of Arms were done, and up sooner was the sports and Magnificences over, but the King to render Sir <HI>Guy</HI> a sitter match for so beautiful a Princess, made him Earl of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and then suffered him to depart with her, to his Kingdom of <HI>Armony.</HI></P>
<P>Queen <HI>Josian</HI> by this time, being desirous to return to <HI>Mambrat,</HI> as a place more agreeable to her health, acquainted Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> with her intent, who thereupon resolved to accompany her again, and leave to Sir <HI>Miles</HI> his younger Son his Inheritance in <HI>England,</HI> hardly could King <HI>Edgar</HI> be perswaded to part with them, how∣ever finding the Queen ill at ease he at length consented, and dis∣missed them with many rich presents, exhorting sundry of the No∣bility to accompany them, which they accordingly did; and upon his
<PB N="62" REF="32"/> Fathers departure, gave to Sir <HI>Miles</HI> all his places, Offices and Titles of Honour, arriving at <HI>Mambrat,</HI> they found the City strong∣ly besieged by <HI>Amphi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on,</HI> a Cousen of the King of <HI>Mambrat;</HI> but the Citizens had made a stout resistance, and killed abundance of men in divers santes they made, but being now quite wearied out, were at a point to yield; whereupon Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> sent secretly into the City, to acquaint them with his arrival, which put them into no small joy, and greatly raised and inspired their drooping Courages, nor was it long, before he gathered an Army in the Country, and sent for Souldiers into <HI>Armony,</HI> whereupon more fully to signalize his Valour to such English Noble-men, as came with him, that they might report what they had seen in their own Country, mounting upon <HI>Arundel,</HI> and taking his Sword <HI>Morglay</HI> in his hand, he fell like a tempest upon the Houst of the Infidels, beating down, and cutting in pieces all▪ that he reached or came in his way, and such slaughter he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>de, that the gro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d was covered with blood, and the bodies of the slain, to be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey <HI>Amph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on</HI> with the strongest of his men advanced, and cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed upon Sir <HI>Bevis,</HI> who though tired with sighting, yet encountre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them all, and with a blow laid <HI>Amphiron</HI> dead at his feet, by cleaving his Helmet and Head in sunder, where∣upon his men were so discouraged, that fearfully shrinking together, they at last betook themselves to open flight, leaving their Camp and all its furniture, as a pity to the Conqueror.</P>
<P>The siege removed, the Cittizens opened their Gates, and came out with Instruments of Musick, Songs and great Ioy to welcome Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> and his Train, who entred the City in Triumph, and re∣established himself in the Throne of <HI>Mambrat,</HI> where giving large Presents to the English Noble-men, he sent them back, so many as would go into <HI>England;</HI> who came home full of the glorious Actions and Atchievements of Sir <HI>Bevis,</HI> speading yet wider his fame that had already render him a most redoubted Champion amongst the Infidels: Insomuch that <HI>Saracon,</HI> the great Soldian of <HI>Babylon,</HI> hearing of his prowess, and how by new Conquests he dayly inlarged his Domi∣nions, began to doubt his Empire, for the indignities of he had put upon Sir <HI>Bevis,</HI> and therefore consulting his great Councellors it was agreed amongst them, that they should enterprize some extraordinary matter to put a stop to the progress of his Arms.</P>

<PB N="64" REF="33"/> fatal news, who was so enraged, that having charged them with Cowardize, he caused the chief of them, or such as were Officers a∣mongst them to be put to death, and so came furiously on, where Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> had drawn up his whole Army, and now the Armies being in sight of each other, though the Infidels with their numerous Hoast covered the Country Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> nothing daunted, incouraged his Soul∣diers with this short Oration: <HI>You see, Fellow Souldier,</HI> said he, <HI>and what is yet more glorious, Fellow Christians, that this numerous Hoast of Infidels, that defy the blessed name of our Lord, and whose Armies we have so often bafled and defeated, are come up against us to destroy us, and take away the Land we so quietly possess, and which by right of war and heritage is our own; wherefore be va∣liant for the truth, and let us this day so well play the men, in shew∣ing forth our utmost prowess, that hereafter our names may become so terrible to them, that they may rather implore our Friendship, and become our Tributaries, than dare to arm against us, and as for my part, my fear is so little, that I doubt not, but this day we shall so deal, that few of them shall escape our hands.</HI> This speech ended with shouts and acclamations of the Souldiers, he commanded the Trumpets to sound the Charge; and <HI>Amphiron</HI> having on the other hand encouraged his men, with great boasts and hopes of assured Victory, both Armies joyned with huge shouts and cryes, so that for the horrible clashing of Swords and Armour, the cryes of the dying, and the shouts of the vanquishers, the sound of Trumpets, and the noise of Drums, the Earth trembled, and the wild beast in the For∣rests stood astonished, when <HI>Amphiron</HI> having in his hand a huge Battle-Ax, came on in the front making lanes as he passed, so that that the Christians seeing the destruction he made, fled on that part, of which Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> had no sooner notice where he fought, and had broken the left Wing of the Pagan Army, having died himself in the blood of a thousand he had slain, but beating down all before him, he made thither, which <HI>Amphiron,</HI> perceiving by the Banner that was born before him, which was a huge Cross enameld and inlayed with Gold, but choosing a thousand of his best men, he gave them com∣mand to inclose Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> on all parts, and that when they had done it, he himself would either take him prisoner, or kill him on the place: These men speedily drew off, to fulfil the pleasure of their General, who had promised them great Rewards, if they performed it, and threatned them with certain death, if they were found wanting
<PB N="65" REF="33"/> in the fulfilling his commands to the utmost of their power: Vpon this, disperately resolved, whilst Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> was making a lane before him, and paving his way with the bodies of the Infidels, whilst some presented themselves before him to stop his approach, others fetching a little compass inclosed him, and pressed on very furiously, by this means, they had separated him from the body of his Army, which he however not regarding, though many of his men were slain about him, with his Sword <HI>Morglay,</HI> made the Arms, Legs and Heads of those that opposed him to fly, so that <HI>Amphiron</HI> was oblieged to hasten, when, to give him entrance, his men opened to the right and lest, and he having in a great rage reproached Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> with the taking King <HI>Jours</HI> Queen and Country from him, as also imprison∣ing him, he, before Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> could well ward the blow, gave him such a stroak with his Battle-Ax, as made him almost tumble from his Horse, but he soon recovering himself, returned it with such fury, that his trusty Sword peirced <HI>Amphiron</HI>'s Armour, and gave him a deep wound in the Shoulder, so that renewing their strength, and either doing his utmost, a mortal battel happened between them, but at length, Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> his men supposing him to be in greater danger than he was, after an obstenate manner, broke in, but ere they came to him, he had with a full stroak cleft <HI>Amphiron</HI>'s Head and Helmet, so that he fell dead at his Feet; which his men seeing, gave back on all hands, and from a kind of a Retreat, finding themselves slain on every side: and now Sir <HI>Miles</HI> coming in with five thousand freshmen, which he had raised unknown to his Father, and beating down all before him, they fell into a confused flight, so that being hotly pursued to the Walls of <HI>Babylon,</HI> they were almost all of them slain, drowned, or taken Prisoners.</P>

<P>How Sir <HI REND="blackletterType">Bevis</HI> besieged <HI>Babylon,</HI> and how Sir <HI REND="blackletterType">Miles,</HI> with a party of Souldiers in disguise, entring the City, was forced to betake himself to a Tower; and how the <HI REND="blackletterType">Soldians</HI> Daughter fell in love with him; and how the City was taken.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>UPon the defeat of this great Army, the City of <HI>Babylon</HI> was filled with the lamentations and cryes of such as had lost their Friends, and others that feared the City would be sack'd, for now the Christian Army approached, spreading their Banners before the palace, which oblieged the Soldian to consult, what was best to be done for his safety; some advising him to send Ambassadours with Presents, and offers of Peace to the Conqueror, and others to stand it out,
<PB N="67" REF="34"/> seeing he had a well fortified City, and many Friends; but so it happened, that whilst they were thus wavering, that King <HI>Jour</HI> having, by corrupting his keepers, made his escape, came in dis∣guise to <HI>Babylon,</HI> earnestly soliciting the Soldian to maintain a War to the utmost against his mortal Enemy, whereupon the defence was resolved upon the Soldian committing to this King the Charge and Guard of the City; so that many Assaults were given, and many sore conflicts happened, in the sallying of the Besieged, but the City being strongly walled and fortefied with Towers, inclosed on most parts with the branches of the River <HI>Euphrates,</HI> it could not be easily approached, which made Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> conclude how one way or other he might take it by Stratagem, and after many consultations it was resolved, that divers armed men, with Pilgrims gowns over their Armour, the better to prevent suspition, should enter the City, and secure one of the Gates to let in the rest of the Army; but then some difficulty arose, who should enterprise this dangerous under∣taking, Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> though he offered it, not being permitted by his Captains, and great Commanders, to undertake so dangerous an Enterprise, but utterly perswaded from it, forasmuch as upon his safety depended not only the preservation of the Army, but the safe∣ty and conservation of the whole Affairs in those parts; and although he vehemently pressed it, and desired nothing more, than to have the honour of so great an undertaking, yet against all he could argue, the intreaties and perswasions of his Friends prevailed; yet not al∣together to loose the glory, he so far prevailed, that Sir <HI>Miles</HI> his Son should attempt it, when not to lose time, all things were pre∣pared in a readiness, and they to the number of two hundred, went to the City hy degrees, and in the night time taking their opportu∣nity, put the Warders to flight, killing many of them, and posses∣sing themselves of the principal Gate, but the Alarm being taken, they every where cryed to Arms, so that before Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> could well reach it with his Army, Sir <HI>Miles</HI> and his men, after having maintained a furious and obstenate fight with the whole power of the City, found themselves obliged to retire to one of the Towers, which in the confusion was almost deserted of the Souldiers that be∣fore guarded it, putting such as they found there to the Sword, and fortefying themselves therein, during which time the Portcullises be∣ing let down, and the Gate again strengthened, though Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> and his men attempted to force the Gate and Wall, with battering
<PB N="68" REF="35"/> Rams and other Engins, yet by reason of their strength, and the stout defence the besieged made, they could not effect it, which troubled Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> much, but more the fair <HI>Josian,</HI> who by this time was come to the Camp, as concluding, that past all peradventure, Sir <HI>Miles</HI> and his men were either taken Prisoners or slain.</P>
<P>During the sorrow the Christian Camp made for this supposed loss and miscariage, the Soldian had strictly caused the Tower to be be∣sieged, which King <HI>Jour</HI> who had the conduct of this affair, pressed on with great vehemency, and was frequently as obstinately repulled, when in the hight of this Action it so happened, that the fair and beautiful <HI>Rosalinda</HI> Princess of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and only Daughter to the Soldian, dreamed she saw Sir <HI>Miles,</HI> or the Imagined Idea of that Heroick young Knight by her bed-side, with whose feacures she was so wonderfully taken, as also with his manly proportion and Mar∣tial looks, that she could not forbear to fix her Eyes upon him, and demand what his request or desire was, or what brought him thither, who returned for answer, that her beauty alone had charmed him, and that although at present he was beset with danger, yet no fear pos∣sessed him, no not twice the number of his Enemies, but the fear of her frowns alone could shake his soul, upon which seeming to dis∣apear with a sigh and much discontent she awaked and was so affected with the Vision, though she found it to be nothing else, that she could not blot it out of her memory, but still fancied the manly shape be∣fore her Eyes, and so far it wrought with her passion, and affection, that she became restless; when standing one day to behold the Assault of the Tower, and perceiving a gallant Youth armed at all points with a Cask of Gold adorned with a Plume of crimson Feathers on his Head, she verely conceited him to be the same she had seen in the Vision, and from that time, used her endeavours with her Father to offer honourable conditions to those that were besieged in the Tower, telling him it would be the only means to obliege the Commanders of the Christian Army to raise the Siege, but finding him inflexible, and Love prompting her on, she adventured with two Knights, whom her Bounty had made her Creatures, and two of her Maids of Honour, under the favour of the night, to find admittance into the Tower, so powerful is Love, that it takes the Diadems from Queens, and with some difficulty obtained it; when being brought to Sir <HI>Miles,</HI> and she perceiving him to be the very same her fancy had represented, she stood in a manner transported, which the courteous Knight per∣ceiving,
<PB N="69" REF="35"/> and seeing so excellent a beauty before him, fell at her feet, and with profound reverence kissed her fair hand, who raising him said, Ah my Lord, why do you shew this respect to your Captive, who though a Princess is nevertheless constrained. (O pardon my mo∣desty, for this freedome, contrary to the rules of our Ser,) to beg a savour, I hope, is in your power to give, and look not upon it, as the effects of my presumption, but the effects of Love, and it is your Love I ask, and for which I have not only undertaken this difficulty, but put my self into the power of my Fathers Enemy, hazarding what ever the World may construe of my reputation. At this the young Knight stood more and more amazed, telling her that in the condi∣tion he was in, he was no ways able to render a returne suitab e to her greatness, much more to her affection, and thus they discoursed, striving to out do each other in Generositie, the Princess offering not only to turn Christian upon this consideration, but to sacrifice her life-to her Fathers Indignation, if no less would satisfie him on his be half, and he protested rather to loose his own life, than suffer her to run the least danger or hazard, when in the mean time King <HI>Jour</HI> and the Captains under his command, prepared to storm the Bulwarks of the Tower, being impatient to have a Foe both with∣in and without at one and the same time, so that having drawn thi∣ther a great strength with Engins, Ropes and scaling Ladders with great eryes they gave a furious onset, upon which the fair <HI>Rosa∣linda</HI> in hopes her presence might stay the assayling Souldiers, whilst Sir <HI>Miles</HI> was setting his men in order, she appeared upon the Walls, and exhorted them to retire, who although they knew her, regarded not her voice at that time, but at the instigation of King <HI>Jour,</HI> were the rather inraged, who suposed, they had taken the Princess Prisoner, and kept her there, as a miserable Captive; so that break∣ing through the out-works, and ascending by degrees, crying out to the Souldiers, that if they intended to have any Quarter, or save their lives, they should instantly deliver up Sir <HI>Miles,</HI> and the place pouring at the same time showers of Arrows, one of which slightly wounded the fair <HI>Rosalinda</HI> in the shoulder, so that the bloud trickled down her snowy Breasts, which Sir <HI>Miles</HI> perceiving, and having caused her to retire out of danger, committing her to the hands of her Maids for cure, in a great fury he threw open the Gates, and with his Sword in his hand cryed to those that pressed on, Behold <HI>Miles,</HI> behold the man you seek is here, to dare your vengance, and with
<PB N="70" REF="36"/> that, leaping forward with an invincible Courage, in spite of all the resistance they made, he covered the steps of the ascent with the bodies of the slain, and being backed with those few Men he had left, fought with unwearied Vigor and Courage, killing all that stood in his way, when to prevent the slaughter, King <HI>Jour</HI> approached with dreadful threatnings and imprecations to revenge the affronts the Father had done him, upon the Son between whom began a mortal Battle, which concluded with the death of the King, and that so disheartned the Souldiers, that they gave back, of which the Soldian having notice, and that his beloved Daughter was in the hands of his Enemy, he came thither with all his power, so that the fight grew exceeding hot, which Sir <HI>Bevis,</HI> who was again advanced to the Walls, perceiving by the crys, though he knew not of certainly that Sir <HI>Miles</HI> was alive, at a venture resolved to hazard the utmost to enter the City, wherein he was so successful, that passing the River at an unsuspected place, he with his battering Rams beat down a part of the Wall, at which breach he entred and so unexpectedly set upon the Soldian, that he overthrew his people by Squadrens, cutting in pieces all that came in his way, whilst Sir <HI>Miles</HI> fighting on the other side, drove them upon his Sword, which piteous plight, of his distresed Citizens, the Soldian perceiving, and that all was in a likelyhood to be lost, he with the Troops of his Guards, and the trusty of his Followers, retired to the pallace leaving the rest to shift for them∣selves, who were miserably slain and beaten down, till throwing away their Weapons, they fell on their Knees, and beged mercy, whereupon, at the intreaty of the Princess, their lives were spared.</P>

<P>ALthough Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> had entred and possessed himself of the City, yet the Pallace being strongly fortified with Ditches, Walls, Ba∣stions and Rampiers, and in it above twelve thousand men, there being no way of easy access to it, but by a Bridge, it caused him to girt it strictly with a close Siege, and threw into it, Wildfire, Stones, and Arrows, which greatly indamaged the besieged, how∣ever
<PB N="72" REF="37"/> the Soldian, though summoned remained obstinate not being willing to listen to any accord, but caused his men to sally in parties as he saw occasion, in which many of them were cut off.</P>
<P>Whilst these things passed, the ardent Affections increased between Sir <HI>Miles</HI> and the Princess <HI>Rosilinda,</HI> he using all manner of dil∣ligence and good carriage to her to obliege her, who notwithstanding became sad through the callamity, that threatned her Father and o∣ther Relations, as also for the great effusion of bloud that had hap∣pened in the City, and especially upon her occasion, and finding no hopes of seeing her Father without a Reconciliation, she studied how she might be instrumental in making a lasting Peace, and yet secure her self in the possession of her Lover, whereupon with only one of her Maids appointed to wait upon her, she retired from the noise and clamour of War, to a private recess, and taking pen, ink and paaper, wrote the following Letter.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>MOST Mighty Soldian, Emperor of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and my honoured Father, How but with Blushes and Con∣fusion, can your disobedient Daughter, frame her self to write unto you, who in a time of danger, has delivered her self into the hands of your Enemies; But Dread Sir, when you shall know that what I have done, proceeded from an extraordinary Affection, a Love surpassing the bounds of Reason, and even of Duty it self: I hope Dread Sir, You will take compassion upon a distressed Maid, in∣volved in many afflictions, and out of the abundance of tenderness and fatherly compassion, pass over this one dis∣obedience in her, who has ever made it her study to obey and Reverence you, and still is ready to sacrifice her life to your displeasure, to expiate so great an offence, but must lowly beg pardon, if she cannot forgoe the powerful Af∣fection, even in death, which has chained her to so gene∣rous an Enemy, who wishes nothing more than your safety and happiness; therefore, dearest Father, If the Tears or Intreaties of your afflicted Daughter, may find any place in your Breast, regard your own safety and the life and ho∣nour
<PB N="73" REF="37"/> of her who but in the case of Love, could have been guilty of an Act of Disobedience, and hearken to the offer of Peace, that will shortly be proposed to you, in hopes this Letter may work upon you in some measure to mit∣tigate your displeasure, and dispose you to imbrace as Friends, those you now hold your Enemies; I remain,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Dread Sir,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your afflicted Daughter <HI>ROSALINDA.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This Letter she sent by her Maid, who by a private known way, got into the City; when in the mean while she continued pensive, in expectation of the event, but Sir <HI>Miles</HI> returning from beating the Soldians men, that had sallied, into the Pallace, dy'd with blood and slaughter, and missing fair <HI>Rosalinda,</HI> whom he had left in his Tent, he made strict enquiry after her, but none being able to sa∣tisfie him herein, between Love and Anger, he stood for a while mute not knowing what to do, or what to determine, one while he supposed this fair Creature came as a Spy to betray him to her Fathers power, during his being inclosed in the Castle, but then con∣sidering the hazard and danger she run, upon enterprizing such a bu∣siness, such low thoughts were dashed, and he concluded that nothing but an extraordinary passion could obliege her to it, blaming himself for having any such thought of so much innocence and goodness, and thereupon sent through the City in search of her, but the Messengers returning without any news, our young Knight concluded, she had secretly withdrawn her self into the Pallace, and upon second thoughts cast her self at her Fathers feet, to implore his pardon for her Disobe∣dience, and so bereft him of all his hopes of happiness, whereupon he began to accuse Fortune, for flattering him with so glorious a prospect of felicity, and then so suddainly to cast a cloud or veil over it, and leave him in darkness and dispair, and so much the distur∣bance increased that his mind began to be in disorder.</P>
<PB N="74" REF="38"/>
<P>Thus whilst Sir <HI>Miles</HI> was grieving for the fair Princess, the Maid returned, having delivered the Letter that was given her in charge, with this answer from the Soldian: That it could never before enter into his thoughts that a Daughter of such tender regard could prove disobedient to her Father, who had so highly cherished her, and prepared a Neighbour King to be her Husband, but since she no more regarded her duty, nor honour than to desert him, and basely cast her self into the Arms of his Enemy unsought, or per∣haps altogether unwelcome, he from that time utterly renounced her, nor did he any longer consider her as his Daughter, but rather as one transformed into an unnatural Monster, to conspire to destroy those that gave her life, under a pretence of Love, however her per∣swasions to peace wrought so little on him, that he was resolved to continue a War to the last extremity, not doubting but he should have powerful Aids come to his Rescue, not being yet so low sunk by one misfortune, but he had yet remaining many Friends. At this sharp reply, the fair Princess fell in a sound, and when she was by the help of her Maid recovered, she very much bewailed and la∣mented her hard fortune, that if she must be obedient, she must for∣go her love; and if she retained her love, she must remain diso∣bedient: but whilst she was in this agony, and in a manner straitned to know what she should determine, Sir <HI>Miles</HI> who had searched all places for his fair Princess, hearing some body sigh in that melancholy and lowly cell, where she sat to bewail her difficulty between love and obedience, he entred, where to his great Ioy he found her in that disconsolate condition and tenderly embracing her with a trans∣port of Ioy, demanded the cause why she had absented her self to put him into so much fear and perplexity, who thereupon told him whatever had passed, entreating him to use his utmost diligence to make a peace, and perswade his Father to offer honourable terms, which he promised to do, when having kissed her fair hand, he took his leave and hasted to the Army, where he found the Ditches fil∣led up with earth and faggots, the scaling ladders and wildfires with all other things prepared for the Assault, and nothing wanting but the signal to be given, whereupon he went to Sir <HI>Bevis,</HI> and implored him, that for his sake, the pallace might be summoned, and peace offered intreating, that himself might make the proposals, which he doubted not but would be accepted, and prove such as would of Ene∣mies make them lasting Friends, which being put into his power to do,
<PB N="75" REF="38"/> he immediatly sent a Trumpet with several Articles, which will be mentioned in the next Chapter, giving the Soldian a days time to con∣sider of them.</P>

<P>How a peace was concluded upon the Soldian, and his people be∣coming Christians, and marrying his Daughter to Sir <HI REND="blackletterType">Miles</HI> with his Dominion as a Dower after his decease. How Sir <HI REND="blackletterType">Be∣vis</HI> and his Queen died, and what was remarkable in their pious end.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Soldian finding the City won, and himself with his Train confined to the Pallace, as many Citizens as could, having escaped the City, he thought it high time to treat for peace, which for some time considering the Indignities that had been put upon Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> would not be hearkned to, but Sir <HI>Miles</HI> at the instance of the fair Princess, so prevailed with his Father, that after many messages from one to the other, it was accorded that in the consi∣deration the Soldian and his people would become Christians and be baptized, and that he would consent to give his Daughter in Mar∣riage to Sir <HI>Miles,</HI> and they after his decease to enjoy all his Do∣minions in the mean while to possess only the Kingdom of <HI>Ar∣mony,</HI> and such Kingdoms as Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> should leave; the City of <HI>Babylon</HI> should be resigned to him, and he and his People left quiet: At which he for some time bogled, but upon notice his Daughter had turned Christian, and resolved to marry Sir <HI>Miles,</HI> with or without his consent, he found himself necessitated to comply, and thereupon all Hostilities being ceased, Proclamation was made for such Citizens as were fled, to return, and an Act of Oblivion passed for what had hap∣pened on all parts. Whilst every thing was preparing in the most splendid manner for the Royal Nuptia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, which were performed in that great City with all the magnificence and splendor imaginable many Neighbouring Potentates both Kings and Queens attended
<PB N="76" REF="39"/> with their Royal Trains and Attendance continuing an extraordina∣ry feast with melodious Musick and Perfumes that scented the whole City for the space of fourteen days; so that nothing but Ioy and<FIGURE>
</FIGURE> Peace resounded in the Streets of <HI>Babylon.</HI> At the end of which Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> and Queen <HI>Josian</HI> with their Train, taking leave of the Soldian, retired to their Kingdom of <HI>Mambrat,</HI> as did Sir <HI>Miles</HI> and <HI>Rosalinda</HI> his fair Princess to their Kingdom of <HI>Armony,</HI> where they flourished many years, and were both loved and feared by all the Neighbouring Princes, much inlarging their Countries; and the Soldian being very aged, dying soon after the Marriage left <HI>Babylon</HI> and all his other Dominions to his Daughter and Son-in-Law.</P>
<P>During these transactions, the Christians that inhabited the <HI>Holy Land</HI> were grievously oppressed by the Infidels, who not only loaded them with grievous Taxes, but took their Children from them, and
<PB N="77" REF="39"/> forcibly oblieged them to embrace the Mahomitan Superstition, and frequently punishing such as refused a complyance with exceeding ri∣gour, so that many of them died under the torments to which they were put, and by reason of this cruel usage, many of them grow∣ing in a manner weary of their lives, they at last, upon notice of Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> his great prowess and extraordinary success, sent to him Let∣ters full of lamentation, advertizing him, how they were made the scorn and Reproach of the Enemies of Christianity humbly imploring him to rescue them out of the hands of their Adversaries, who there∣upon calling together his Friends, advised with them what was to be done in so weighty an affair; who after mature diliberation, told him, that since Heaven had so signally prospered his undertakings, he should not neglect so good a work, as to succor and relieve his di∣stressed Fellow Christians, whereupon he raised an Army of forty thousand men, and taking leave of his Queen, passed into <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ine,</HI> and there after a bloudy and obstinate fight, overthrew an Army of 200000 Turks and Sarazens, who were gathered to oppose his passage; upon which bloody overthrow, most of the Towns yielded at the first summons, and those that held out were obliged to do it by compulsion; so that making himself intire Master of the Country, he restored those places to the Christians, that had been forcibly taken from them, and acted such prodigious wonders in Va∣lour, that his name grew terrible to the Infidels, who sued for Peace, and in order to obtain it, sent their Ambassadors with great Pre∣sents, protesting not only to live peaceably with the Christians, but to hold the Country tributary of him, which submission being accepted, he le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t strong Garrisons in the most important places, and constitu∣ting the Patriarch of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to have the supream Command under him, he returned to his Kingdom with great Triumph and Applause.</P>
<P>By this time Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> grown in years, and having spent much time in War and B oodshed, promoting what in him lay, the Chri∣stian Religion and delivering the oppressed Christians from the Turks and Sarazens Tyrany, he betook himself and his Queen to a Re∣ligious Life sending for Sir <HI>Guy</HI> to succeed him in his Dominion, bequeathing all his possessions in <HI>England</HI> to Sir <HI>Terry,</HI> Son to Sir <HI>Sabre</HI> now deceased; when falling sick with his Queen, he cal∣led his Sons before him, and having established them in the pos∣session of those Kingdoms he had gained, he enjoyned them on his blessing to carry his, and his Queens Body, when they should hap∣pen
