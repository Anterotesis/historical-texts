<HEAD>A Reply to an Answer from a Friend, to the Apology for the English Nation; that the Trade to the <HI>East-Indies</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> should be free.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHen I desired your Opinion of the Apology for the English Nation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I expected you would have first answered where I began; <HI>viz.</HI> That all Nations, as well as the Inhabitants of Nations, by Equal Right or the Law of Nature, may entertain Trade and Commerce with one a∣nother: and if in Times of Peace Humane Laws shall debar Subjects of this Right, this is practising Iniquity by a Law: And that you would have Objected against the Reasons, which the Parliament gave 3 <HI>Jac. C.</HI> 6. for the freedom of the English in the Spanish Trade; or that these Reasons did not hold in the <HI>East-India</HI> Trade, but of these you say not one word▪</P>
<P><HI>You say when you were in</HI> London, <HI>all Men Agreed the</HI> East-India <HI>Trade could not be driven, without a Company, because of the Power of the</HI> Dutch <HI>in those Seas.</HI></P>
<P>I suppose you mistake me in contending against a Company Exclu∣sive to all others▪ for it is not a Company I contend against; but the Exclusion of all others: For your seeming Reason of the <HI>Dutch</HI> power in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> to necessitate a Trade by the <HI>English</HI> in a Company, it will not hold; unless you can make an <HI>English</HI> Company to be equal to the <HI>Dutch</HI> in power, which can never be hoped for; but if it could▪ it could never be by Excluding others, which might contribute to the Encrease of it.</P>
<P>For the Instance you give of the <HI>Turkey</HI> Trade; it hath no resem∣blance to the Trade in the <HI>East-Indies:</HI> For our Trade to <HI>Turkey,</HI> is up∣on the Matter, but to one place, <HI>viz. Smyrna;</HI> whereas that which the Company call the <HI>East-India</HI> Trade, is to all the Parts on the East of <HI>Africa,</HI> and the Southern Parts of <HI>Asia,</HI> to the North of <HI>China,</HI> with all
<PB N="4" REF="3"/> the Islands which lye in that vast Ocean; so that for ought is known Tenfold the Trade might be managed by the <HI>English</HI> there, if the Trade were free, than to <HI>Turky;</HI> which is impossible to be done by one Com∣pany exclusive to all others; in the numerous and vast Dominions in those parts of the World.</P>
<P>Besides the Objection which you make of the <HI>Dutch</HI> power in those Seas, to exclude all others but a Company is a Topick set up only by the Favourers of the <HI>East-India</HI> Company; for unless you suppose the <HI>Dutch</HI> power to he more than that of all the Princes of <HI>Africk, Asia,</HI> and all the Islands in the vast Ocean, these cannot give Laws to them, all; and this is an Argument which the Company, themselves do not be∣lieve, for if granted, Interlopers could never Trade to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> which is the greatest fear the Company have.</P>
<P>But suppose all the Princes in <HI>Africk</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI> could not protect the <HI>English</HI> in their Trade with them; yet sure a King of <HI>England</HI> is not so faln from power, but that he is able to protect his Subjects in all their Just Trades from the Violences and Oppressions of the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P><HI>You say the Commons had reason to refer the Business of the Erecting a new</HI> East-India <HI>Company to the King, they having so little time to Sit.</HI></P>
<P>The Commons had busied themselves above four Months in Esta∣blishing this Company, more than in any thing else, and then threw it upon the King, who in the Circumstances he is in, cannot attend it four days.</P>
<P><HI>But you say you doubt not but the Commons upon their next Sitting, will assume this Business again, and then will undoubtedly Blow up the present Com∣pany.</HI> But this will be more strange than to Vote an <HI>East-India</HI> Com∣pany exclusive to all others, to be Established by Act of Parliament; and then to throw it upon the King; and after to take it out of the power of the King.</P>
<P>But here you may see how Industriously Men pursue their Interest, without any regard to Justice or Prudence: For all this time in propa∣gating an <HI>East India</HI> Company exclusive to other Men, no regard is had how the <HI>English</HI> might be secured from the Violences and Injuries of the <HI>Dutch</HI> in it; nor how it can be carried on by the <HI>English</HI> in the miserable and distracted state, the now Company have brought it to, with the <HI>Mogull, Sophy</HI> of <HI>Persia,</HI> and King of <HI>Syam.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> power in the <HI>East-Indies</HI> is vastly more than the <HI>English,</HI> yet to maintain this, they are at as vast Charges in maintaining it, so that where the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Trade, with all the other Princes of the <HI>Indies, Persia,</HI> or <HI>China,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> Trade is so much cheaper, as they are at less Charges in maintaining their Dominions, nor can it be ever hoped the <HI>English,</HI> with or without a Company can expel the <HI>Dutch</HI> out of their Dominions in the <HI>East-Indies.</HI></P>
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>
<P>It's true, the <HI>Dutch</HI> have been as Injurious to this present Company (if Injuries can be done to such a Company of Men) as the Company has been to the rest of the <HI>English</HI> Nation: For besides the Business of <HI>Amboyna;</HI> which was not in this Companies time; they Outed the Com∣pany from <HI>Polloroon,</HI> where the Natives could not protect them, and was a principal cause of the second <HI>Dutch</HI> War in King <HI>Charles</HI> the Se∣cond's Reign: And by falshood kept the Company from Trading to <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan,</HI> alledging the <HI>English</HI> were Christians; and the King had Married the King of <HI>Portugal</HI>'s Daughter: (the <HI>Portuguez</HI> of all Na∣tions being most detestible to the <HI>Chiness;</HI>) and now by joining with the young King of <HI>Bantam</HI> against his Father; they keep the King Pri∣soner, and make use of his Name, to expel the <HI>English</HI> from their Trade to <HI>Bantam</HI> for Pepper, so as the <HI>English</HI> are forced to Trade to the West of <HI>Sumatra</HI> for Pepper, a most unhealthful place, where more <HI>English</HI> lose their Lives, than ten times the Trade is worth, of which the Company have no regard, so as they could purchase a Pound of Pepper by the loss of ten <HI>English</HI> Men: The unhealthiness of this place being represented to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> she forbid her Subjects Trading to <HI>Sumatra.</HI></P>
<P>In the second <HI>Dutch</HI> War, the <HI>French</HI> joyned with King <HI>Charles</HI> against the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and thereby the <HI>Dutch</HI> were reduced so low, as they were in the War with the Rump Parliament; but the Parliament dreading the Consequences, Petitioned the King to make a separate Peace with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> without including the <HI>French;</HI> but this prevailed but little, till the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassador, the Marquess <HI>Del Fresno</HI> interposed, threat∣ning other ways, <HI>Spain</HI> would break with <HI>England,</HI> and then the King made a separate hasty Peace with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> whereby a Regulation of Trade was agreed to be settled, and adjusted in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> by certain Commissioners on both sides.</P>
<P>Persuant hereto, the 9th. of <HI>Feb.</HI> 1673. six Commissioners named by the King, entred into a Treaty, with Six sent by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> who were to settle the Regulations and adjust the Trade to the <HI>East-Indies</HI> in three Months time; and what was not settled in that time, was to be referred to the Queen Regent of <HI>Spain,</HI> who was to Name Eleven Commissioners, the Major part whereof was to deter∣mine what was not settled; provided they gave their Judgment with∣in Six Months to be computed from the time they met; which was to be within three Months after the Queen had taken this Award upon her. But tho' these Commissioners set more than three times the time limitted for Adjusting the <HI>East-India</HI> Trade; <HI>viz.</HI> till the first of <HI>Dec.</HI> 1674. yet they concluded nothing in it, nor was ever any further Refe∣rence to the Queen Regent of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
<P>Thus this Prince <HI>Charles</HI> the Second having joined with the <HI>French</HI> in a War against the <HI>Dutch,</HI> to the Disturbance of the peace of <HI>Christen∣dom,</HI> because of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Oppressions and Wrongs done the <HI>English</HI> in their Trades in the <HI>East Indies.</HI> Now to get 800000 Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oons of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and a round Sum of Money from the Parliament, makes a se∣parate Peace with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and leaves the <HI>English</HI> in their Trades to the <HI>East-Indies</HI> in the same state it was before: And sure the cosiderati∣on hereof had been more worthy the wisdom of the Commons, than their Debates Four Months together to Establish an <HI>East-India</HI> Company exclusive to all others.</P>
<P>Nor can I imagine how this Intended Exclusive Company by the Commons, or any of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, can Trade to the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s or King of <HI>Syam</HI>'s Dominions, before the Differences made by this Companies War with them be Adjusted; you cannot believe we have a true Representation of them from the Company; nor do I be∣lieve the Company themselves understand them: And do you think the <HI>Mogull</HI> or King of <HI>Syam,</HI> will sit down by the Loss? Or that it is rea∣sonable, the Kings other Subjects, which the Company have denied the Benefit of the Trade to the <HI>East Indies,</HI> should be liable to pay their Debts there; and make Restitution for all the Violences and Deprada∣tions the Company have committed.</P>
<P>But admit the Company be in a condition to pay the Expence of this War, and their Debts contracted in it, which Mr. <HI>White</HI> computes to be Seventeen Hundred Thousand Pounds; its probable the Company ha∣ving spent all the Money there, must return it thither out of <HI>England;</HI> and I think at this time the Nation is not in a condition to part with such a Sum; and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> when these things had been Adjusted, it had been time enough to have debated, whether the <HI>East India</HI> Trade might been better carried on by a Company exclusive to all others, or that it should be free.</P>
<P>So I leave it to you to judge, whether it be not more to be wished, that the King will please to Adjust and Regulate thee Trade of the <HI>East-Indies;</HI> especially concerning the Trades to <HI>Amboyna, Poll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> and <HI>Ban∣tam;</HI> and send Ambassadors to the <HI>Mogull</HI> and King of <HI>Syam,</HI> to vin∣dicate the rest of the <HI>English</HI> Nation from the Violences and Rapines which the Company have committed upon their Subjects; and to inspect the state of Affairs in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> as they now stand; and to enter into a Treaty of Commerce with the <HI>Sophy</HI> of <HI>Persia, Mogull,</HI> the Empe∣ror of <HI>China,</HI> and other Princes of the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> with whom the <HI>En∣glish</HI> shall Trade; before he Erect any Company to Trade to all these Princes, and be thereby Liable to the Violences of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and to make satisfaction for all the Debts and Depradations of the n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w Company.</P>
<PB N="67" REF="4"/>
<P>I agree with you that the Company have no Right to the Half Cu∣stoms of Goods vended in the Gulph of <HI>Persia;</HI> nor that they ever paid any thing for them, yet more than double the worth of all the Joint∣stock the Company imployed in this Trade to the <HI>East-Indies:</HI> And that these Customs ought to be imployed in Building Forts in proper places for securing the <HI>English</HI> Traffick in those Seas: And that when these Moneys are not so Imployed, they are due to the King.</P>
<P>We agree too, that the <HI>African</HI> Company is Injurious to the Nation in the Vent of our Native Commodities; and in our Trades to the Plan∣tations; nor is this Company less injurious to the Nation in their re∣turns: For a Worker in Ivory assured me within three days, that the Company has raised the prizes of Elephants Teeth, threefold more than when the Trade was free; and what is this but to impose a dear∣ness upon all Ivory Manufactures at Home, and to Establish the For∣reign Vent of them to the <HI>Dutch, French,</HI> and other Nations to our Loss, and undoing of Thousands of people, who other ways might be em∣ployed in them. <HI>Ex ungue Leonem;</HI> by this you may judge of the rest?</P>
