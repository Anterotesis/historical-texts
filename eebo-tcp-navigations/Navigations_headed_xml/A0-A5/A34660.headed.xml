<P>And further for the same end, and to prevent the offendours lying long in prison, it shall be lawfull for the Governor, with one of the Counsell, or any two of the Assistants or Iudges, to see execution done upon any offenders for any crime that is not capitall, according to the Lawes established: Yet still reserving a liberty of Appeale from them to the Court, and from an Inferiour Court to an Higher Court.</P>

That whosoever shall apply themselves to set forward the trade of fishing, as Fisher-men, Marriners and Ship wrights, shall be allowed, man for man, or some or other of the Labourers of the Countrey, to plant and to reape for them, in the season of the yeare, at the publike charge of the Common-wealth, for the space of these seven yeares next ensuing; and such Labourers to be appointed and paid by the Treasurer of the Common-wealth.</P>
<P N="3">3 Because no Common-wealth can maintaine either their authori∣ty at home, or their honour and power abroad, without a sufficient Treasury: a Law therefore to be made for the electing and furnish∣ing

<P>That in case the Inheritance of the Lands belong to any Towne, come to be alienated from the Townesmen, which may unavoydably fall out: Yet a supply may be had and made to the livelyhood of the Town by a reasonable Rent charge, upon such alienations laid by the common consent of the Land-owners and Townesmen, and to be paid unto the Treasury of the Town.</P>

<P>Whatsoever Lands belong to any Town, shall be given and assi∣gned by the Town or by such Officers therein, as they shall appoint unto any person, the same shall belong and remaine, unto such person and his heires and assignes as his proper right for ever.</P>
<P N="3">3 And in dividing of Lands to the severall persons in each Town, as regard is to be had partly to the number of the persons in family: To the more assigning the greater allotment, to the fewer lesse, and partly by the number of beasts,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Num. 26.53 54. Num 35.3.</NOTE> by the which a man is fit to occupy the Land assigned to him, and subdue it: Eminent respect (in this case may be given to men of eminent quality and descent) in assigning unto them more large and honorable accommodations, in regard of their great disbursements to publike charges.</P>
<P N="4">4 Forasmuch as all Civill affaires are to be administred and orde∣red, so as may best conduce to the upholding and setting forward of the worship of God in Church fellowship. It is therefore ordered, that wheresoever the Lands of any mans Inheritance shall fall, yet no man shall set his dwelling house above the distance of halfe a mile or a mile at the furthest, from the meeting of the Congregation, where the Church doth usually assemble for the worship of God.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>

<P N="7">7 The will of a Testatour, is to be approved, or disallowed by the Court of Governours, and Assistants, or by the Court of Iudges in each Towne; yet not to be disallowed by the Court of Governours, unlesse it appeare either to be counterfeit or unequall, either against the Law of God, or against the publike weale, or against the due right of the Legatours.</P>
<P N="8">8 As God in old time, in the Common-wealth of <HI>Israell,</HI> forbad the alienation of Lands from one Tribe to another, so to prevent the like inconvenience in the alienation of Lands, from one Towne to ano∣ther it were requisite to be ordered.</P>
<P N="1">1 First, that no free Burgesse, or free Inhabitant of any Town shall sell the Land allotted to him in the Towne, (unlesse the free Burgesse of the Towne give consent unto such sale, or refuse to give due price answerable to what other offer without fraud) but to some one or other of the free Burgesses, or free Inhabitants of the same Towne.</P>
<P N="2">2 That if such Lands be sould to any others, the sale shall be made with reservation of such a rent charge to be paid to the Town Stock, or Treasury of the Towne, as either the former occupiers of the Land were wont to pay towards all the publike charges thereof; whether in Church or Town, or at least after the rate of three shillings the acre or some such like proportion, more or lesse, as shall be thought fit.</P>
<P N="3">3 That if any free Burgesses, or free Inhabitants of any Towne, or the heire of any of their Lands, shal remove their dwelling from one Towne to another, none of them shall carry away the whole benefit of the Lands which they possessed, from the Townes whence they remove: But if they shall keepe the right of Inheritance, in their own hands, &amp; not sell it as before, then, they shall reserve a like proportion or Rent charge out of their Land, to be paid to the publike Treasury of the Towne, as hath beene wont to be paid out of it to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ublike charges of the Town and Church, or at least after the rate of three or five shillings an Acre, as before.</P>
<P N="4">4 That if the Inheritance of a free Burgesse, or free Inhabitants of any Town fal to his daughters, as it wil do for defect of heires males, that then if such daughters doe not marry to some of the Inhabitants
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>of the same Towne where their Inheritance lyeth, nor sell their In∣heritance to some of the same Towne as before, that then they reserve a like proportion of rent charge out of their Lands to be paid to the publike Treasury of the Towne, as hath beene wont to be paid out of them, to the publike charge of the Towne and Church; or at least after the rate of three or five shillings an Acre, provided alwayes that nothing be payed to the maintenance of the Church out of the Treasury of the Church or Towne, but by the free consent and di∣rection of the free Burgesses of the Towne.</P>
