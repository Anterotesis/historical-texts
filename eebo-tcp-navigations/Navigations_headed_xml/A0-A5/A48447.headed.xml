<HEAD>To my most Honoured, and highly esteemed Friend,

<OPENER><SALUTE>Honour'd Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE first and last time you gave
me the favour to kisse your
hands, since my return from
the Southern and Western
parts of the World, you were
pleased to make some enquiries of me,
concerning the Iland of <HI>Barbados,</HI> a
place you much desired to be satisfied
in: But, by reason my stay was but short,
I could give You but a sleight and
scant relation, of the many particulars
you were desirous to be informed in;
so that for the present, I rather poynted
at, then gave a home-satisfaction, to
what was most fit to be known, of the
Beauties and Riches of that place. Where∣upon
you were pleased to impose on me
a task, (very unfit for me to undertake,
being one altogether unlettered) to de∣liver
<PB REF="3"/>
in writing, the sum of all I knew,
concerning that Iland. Though I were
sufficiently conscious of mine own ina∣bilities;
yet, my obedience to your com∣mands,
led me on, to give you a private
satisfaction, in a thing you so earnestly
desired, which was all I aimed at: But,
upon perusall of it, you were pleased to
give me a far greater encouragement, then
I expected, with your allowance for the
publishing of it, for the common benefit
of those, who intend to spend their times,
and venture their fortunes upon such un∣dertakings▪
so that I wanted but means or
friends, for the putting it forth; but, those
two being absent, it has layne in the dark
this two years. You were then likewise
pleased, to cast your eyes upon some pieces
of Limning, which I had done since my
return, (by my memory only) of the
Trees, Plants, and Fruits, which I had seen
growing upon that place; things in them∣selves
of infinite beauty, but losing much
of their life and lustre, by my ill handling;
yet, you were pleased to afford them an
approbation, beyond their value, which
gave me an ambition, to do somewhat in
that kinde, more like a Master; and to that
purpose, was designing a piece of Land∣scape,
and one of Story, wherein I meant
to expresse the postures of the Negres, in
their severall kinds of Sports and Labours;
<PB REF="3"/>
and with it, the beauties of the Vegeta∣bles,
that do adorn that place, in the high∣est
perfection I could: But presently after,
being cast into Prison, I was deprived both
of light and lonelinesse, two main helpers
in that Art; and so being disabled to dis∣cern
or judge of Colours, I was compelled
to expresse my designes in Black and
White: So that now you will finde expo∣sed
to your view, a piece of wild <HI>Grotesco,</HI>
or loose extravagant <HI>Drolorie,</HI> rather than
a Regular piece of Story or Landscape.</P>
<P>Rough drawn, and unproportionably
stell'd, though it be, I here present it; which,
though it be but as a Drop to the Ocean,
or a Mite to the treasury of your Know∣ledge;
yet, in obedience to your commands,
which have a powerfull operation on me, I
could do no lesse then give you an account
of what I had done, howweak and unperfect
soever. And so begging pardon for the
faults committed, both in the Language,
and ill contrivance of my Discourse, I
humbly take my leave, and rest.</P>

<HEAD>The Letter of the Bishop of Sar. to me then
in Prison, after he had perused my Book.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>OV can best tell, with what pleasure you past
over your Voyage to the <HI>Barbadoes:</HI> But,
whatsoever it was, your dangers at Sea, and
your long sicknesse on Land, had been enough to
sour it, had not the condition of the times made
any place more acceptable, than your Native
Country. But, the pleasure which you have given me, in reading
this Narrative, is without all these mixtures: For, without any
hardship at all, I have in a few daies gone the same voyage, view'd
the Iland, weigh'd all the Commodities and Incommodities of it;
and all this with so much pleasure, that I cannot, without great
injustice, forbear telling you, that though I have read formerly
many Relations of other parts of the World, I never yet met with
so exact a piece, as this of yours. Your diligence hath been great
in so short a time, to make these Observations; but, your expressi∣ons
of them are such, as shew, that no ingenious Art hath scap't
you. You say, that in your younger time, you acquainted your selfe
with Musick and Painting; and had you not said so, the reading
of this Book would have made me say it for you; for, it is so
Musically made up, and all the descriptions so Drawn to the life,
that I know no Painting beyond it. And for the question you put
to me, whether you should publish it or no, I desire you would
make no doubt of it; for first, I know none that hath written of this
Argument before; and next, I am perswaded, that having read
this Description of yours, none that come after will venture upon
it. Only, I have one request to you, that your kindnesse to me,
(who without any designe, gave you the occasion of doing it) may
not lead you into such an insufferable errour, as to choose me out as
<PB REF="5"/>
a fit person to inscribe it to, who am so much in the shade, that I
must not own my selfe. I am willing to believe, that though Ho∣nour
be at this time at a very low <HI>Ebb,</HI> and, by the iniquity of the
times, is much falne within the Banks; yet, the Channell is not
so drie, but you may meet there with some Noble person, that
may with more advantage, take you and your Book into the same
Cock-boat with him, and keep you this Winter both from cold and
hunger. And therefore, in great earnestnesse I desire you, to look
over your Catalogue of Friends; and, though you cannot finde one
that loves you better, yet, to make choice of him, that can protect
you better. And so with my prayers for you, that your afflictions
here may be so managed by you, as to lead you to Joyes hereafter,
I rest.</P>

<HEAD>A TRUE AND EXACT
HISTORY
OF THE ILAND OF
BARBADOES.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>Aving been Censur'd by some (whose Judgements
I cannot controll, and therefore am glad to allow)
for my weakenesse and Indiscretion, that having ne∣ver
made proofe of the Sea's operation, and the seve∣rall
faces that watry Element puts on, and the chan∣ges
and chances that happen there, from Smooth to
Rough, from Rough to Raging Seas, and High going
Billowes, (which are killing to some Constitutions,) should in the last
Scene of my life, undertake to run so long a Risco from <HI>England</HI> to the
<HI>Barbadoes;</HI> And truly I should without their help conclude my selfe
guilty of that Censure, had I not the refuge of an old proverb to fly to,
which is, (Need makes the old wife trot:) for having lost (by a Bar∣barous
Riot) all that I had gotten by the painfull travells and cares of
my youth; by which meanes I was stript and rifled of all I had, left de∣stitute
of a subsistance, and brought to such an Exigent, as I must fa∣mish
or fly; and looking about for friends, who are the best suppor∣ters
in so staggering a condition, found none, or very few, whom griefs
and afflictions had not deprest, or worne out, Banishment absented, or
Death devour'd; so that in stead of these neere and Native com∣forters,
I found my selfe a stranger in my owne Country, and therefore
resolv'd to lay hold on the first opportunity that might convoy me to
any other part of the World, how far distant soever, rather then abide
here. I continued not many weekes in this expectation, when a friend,
as willing to shift his ground as I, gave me an Overture which I accep∣ted,
and so upon the sixteenth day of <HI>June</HI> 1647. we embark'd in the
Downes, on the good Ship called the <HI>Achilles;</HI> a vessell of 350 tunnes
the Mr. <HI>Thomas Crowder</HI> of <HI>London;</HI> and no sooner were we all aboard,
but we presently weighed Anchor, and put to Sea; in so cold weather
as at that time of the yeere, I have not felt the like; and continued so
till wee came to <HI>Falmouth Harbour:</HI> where wee put in, and rested for
a night; but in our passage thither, were very uncertaine upon what
Coast wee were, by reason of the unsteadinesse of the windes, and
cloudinesse of the weather; so that I perceived more troubles and
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
doubts in the Seamen in that short passage, than in all the voyage af∣ter.
But, the weather clearing up, the Master and Mates drew out
severall plots and Landscapes: which they had formerly taken upon
the Coast of <HI>France</HI> and England, (which are of great use in the nar∣row
Seas,) by which they were well assured where they were; for
there they seldome use <HI>Loggline,</HI> or <HI>Backstaffe,</HI> but attend onely the
Tides▪ Compasse, and Card; nor is there any use of other directors
in so narrow a roome. We were (as I remember) about 10. dayes
sayling to Falmouth, and had with us a small ship of about 180.
tunnes, called the Nonesuch; of which Captaine <HI>Middleton</HI> was own∣er,
a very good seaman, and a Planter in <HI>Barbados:</HI> but himselfe then
remaining in London.</P>
<P>The next day we put to Sea, and continued our course to the South-west,
(with somewhat a Scant wind,) partly to avoid the high go∣ing
<HI>Billowes</HI> of the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Biskey:</HI> but chiefely to stand aloofe from
<HI>Pirats</HI> and <HI>Pickaronoes:</HI> which are very frequent upon the <HI>Coasts</HI> of
<HI>Spaine,</HI> and <HI>Barbarie;</HI> and as we past along, I perceiv'd a difference in
the way of our Ships: for in slack windes, our consort the None-such
would runne us out of sight in foure or five houres sayle; but
in strong and stiffe windes, wee did the like with her. So that I
guest the larger the sayles, the swifter the waye; provided, they
were alike built in the modell of their keeles, but I leave that to be
resolved by the Seamen, or that Admirable Architect of Moving-Horses,
Mr. <HI>Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t.</HI></P>
<P>About the Latitude of 45. degrees, wee met with a Ship comming
from <HI>Guinny,</HI> but bound for <HI>London;</HI> the Captains name was <HI>Blague,</HI> a
very civill Gentleman who halde us, came aboard us, and invited
divers Gentlemen that were there aboard his ship: which was a Frig∣got
of about 400. tunnes, her loading <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Elephants teeth;</HI> the Man
was exceeding civill to us, and gave to every Gentleman of our Com∣pany,
a present of such rarities as he brought from <HI>Guinny,</HI> and <HI>Binny.</HI>
We stayed together almost a whole day, the weather being very
calme, and almost no wind at all; in the evening, a fresh breese be∣gan
to blow, which serv'd us both in our severall wayes, and so
saluting each other with our ordinance wee took leave.</P>
<P>About this time, our Consort the None-such parted with us, she
directly for the Carribby Ilands, we for St. <HI>Jago,</HI> one of the Ilands of
<HI>Cape Verd;</HI> where wee were to trade for <HI>Negros,</HI> Horses, and Cattell;
which we were to sell at the <HI>Barbados.</HI> So, keeping our course about
80. Leagues from the Coast of <HI>Spaine</HI> and <HI>Barba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie,</HI> the first land wee
discovered, was the Ile of <HI>Porto Santo;</HI> which lyeth in 33. degrees to
the <HI>Noreward;</HI> which wee left of our <HI>Larboard</HI> side: When presently
after, we had sight of the <HI>Maderas,</HI> which we sayld close by, and had
a full view of the place; so Rocky, and Mountainous, and the ground
so miserably burnt with the Sun, as we could perceive no part of it
either Hill or Valley, that had the least appearance of green, nor any
tree bigger then a small Hathorne and very few of those. Between
this and three inconsiderable Ilands called the <HI>Deserts,</HI> which appea∣red
to us like the tops of large buildings; no unevennesse or risings
and fallings, but levell as the toppe of a large Church or Barne; but
burnt worse then the other, so that instead of the fresh and lively
greenes, other Countreys put on at this time of the yeare: these were
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
apparell'd with Russets, or at best <HI>Phyliamorts.</HI> But it fell out that this
yeere the summer was there hotter then usually, and the Sea men that
were with us, gave us to understand, that they never had seen it so
burnt as now, and that the <HI>Leeward</HI> part of it was, at other times, ex∣ceeding
fruitfull and pleasant, abounding with all sorts of excellent
fruits, Corne, Wine, Oyle, and the best Sugars; with Horses, Cattell,
Sheep, Goates, Hogges, Poultrey; of all sorts, and the best sorts of Sea-fish. These Ilands lye neere 33. degrees to the <HI>Noreward.</HI></P>
<P>Having past between these (leaving the <HI>Maderas</HI> on of our <HI>Star∣board</HI>
side) wee found a constant trade-wind to carry us to the <HI>South∣ward,</HI>
When the next Iland that came in our view, was <HI>Bona Vista;</HI> but
at such a distance, as we could hardly discerne colours, but the gene∣rall
Landscape of the hills seemed to one very beautifull, gently ri∣sing
and falling, without Rockes or high precipices.</P>
<P>This Iland is famous, for excellent Salt, and for Horses, which in
one property, excell all that ever I have seene; their hooves being to
that degree of hardnesse, and toughnesse, that we ride them at the
<HI>Barbados,</HI> downe sharp and steepie Rocks, without shooes; and no
Goates goe surer upon the sides of Rockes and Hills then they; and
many of them very strong and clean limb'd.</P>
<P>This Iland, wee left ten Leagues, or thereabouts on our Larboard
side, and next to it, the Ile of <HI>May;</HI> famous for store of excellent
Salt.</P>
<P>The last of those Ilands was <HI>Palma;</HI> a land so high, as after wee first
discovered it; which was in the morning; wee thought to have
reacht it that night, but found our selves farre short of it, next mor∣ning,
though wee had a full gaile all that night: so much is the eye
deceived in Land which lyes high. This Iland is about 28 degrees
to the Noreward, and from it to the Iles of <HI>Cape Verd</HI> about 13 degrees
a long way to bee silent, for there is no land between and therefore
I purpose to entertaine you with some Sea delights; for there is no
place so void and empty, where some lawfull pleasure is not to bee
had, for a man that hath a free heart, and a good Conscience. But
these Sea-pleasures are so mixt with Cruelties, as the trouble of the
one, abates much the delight of the other, for here wee see the great
ones, eate up the little ones, as they doe at Land, and with as little
remorse; yet laying that consideration aside the Chase affords some
pleasure to the eyes: for some kinds of fishes shew themselves above
water, for a long while together. I have seen 20 Porpisces very
large of that kinde, Crosse the Prow of our Ship, one behind another
in so steady and constant a course, in chase of some other fishes; as I
have seen a kennell of large Hounds, in Windsor Forrest, in the chase
of a Stag; one following another directly in a track; and the onely
difference I finde is, these doe not spend their mouthes, but what
they want in that is supplyed by the goodnesse of their noses; for
they never are at a fault, but goe constantly on. The Dolphins like∣wise
pursue the flying Fish, forcing them to leave their knowne
watry Elements, and flye to an unknowne one, where they meet with
as mercilesse enemies; for there are birds that attend the rising of
those fishes; and if they bee within distance, seldome fayle to make
them their owne. These birds, and no other but of their kinde,
love to straggle so far from land; so that it may be doubted, whether
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
the sea may not bee counted their naturall home; for wee see them
500 leagues from any land, at Sun setting; and so it is not possible
they should recover land that night; and on the waves they cannot
rest, without great hazzard. I have seen them sometimes light, and
sit upon the waves, but with such Caution: for feare of being taken
in by a fish, as her rest is very unsafe; unlesse when she is covered
by the nights dark wings. This Bird, is a kinde of sea Hawke, some∣what
bigger then a Lanner, and of that colour; but of a far freer
wing, and of a longer continuance; and when she is weary, she finds
resting places, if the Seas be Calme; for then the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urtles lye and
sleep upon the waves, for a long time together; and upon their backs
they sit, and sleep securely; and there, mute, prune, and oyl their fea∣thers;
rouse, and doe all their Offices of nature, and have roome e∣nough
for all, for some of those Turtles are a yeard broad in the back:
wee took one with our long Boate, as he lay sleeping on the water,
whose body afforded all the Gentlemen, and Officers of the Ship, a
very plentifull meal; and was the best meat wee tasted, all the time
wee were at Sea. There are of these kinds of Fishes but two sorts,
that continue in the mayne; the Loggerhead Turtle, and the Hawkes
bill Turtle, of which sorts, the latter is the best, and of that kind ours
was that wee took. There is a third kind, called the Green Turtle
which are of a leffer Magnitude, but far excelling the other two,
in wholesomnesse, and Rarenesse of taste; but of them hereafter
for I have no mind to part so leightly, with the forenamed Birds of
prey: For having been bred a Faulconer in my youth, I cannot but ad∣mire
the admirable swiftnesse of wing these birds make. They
mount sometimes upon the trayne, to so loftie a pitch: as, if a Fau∣con
were there, Shee might be allowed a double Cancellere in her
stooping to her game: they doe it at one entire downe come. Her
ordinary flying for her own pleasure, and not for prey▪ is common∣ly
more free then the best Haggard Faulcon, that I have ever seen;
but the continuance of it makes it the more admirable. At the
times they grow hungry, they attend the <HI>Dolphins,</HI> who are their Spani∣els;
and where they perceive the water to move, they know they are
in Chase, of the flying fish; and being neere them, they rise like Co∣veys
of Partridges by 12 and 16 in a Covey, and flye as far as young
Partridges, that are farkers, and in their flight these birds make
them their quarry.</P>
<P>These frighted fishes, sometimes in the night have crost our ship,
and being stopt by the shroudes, have falne downe; and with their
bodieswe have baited hookes, and taken their pursuers the Dolphins;
which we have found very excellent meat, being drest by a good hand,
with Wine, Spice, and sweet herbs, which we never wanted. So here
we have excellent hauking, no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eare of losing our hauke, by go∣ing
out at Cheik, or to a village to Poult, and yet eate of the quarrie,
and sometimes of the Spaniells, which is an advantage the best faulco∣ners
misse at Land. As for the hunting here, we only see the Chase, but
suffer the hounds to flesh themselves upon the quarrie, or it may be, a
royall fish, such a one as may fill a dish to furnish Neptunes table, &amp; by
that meanes we are cosen'd of our quarry. So that as I ever thought
on Land, I find the same at Sea, Hawking to be the better sport. I
had almost forgot, to tell what kind of fish this flying fish is, which is
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
the cause of such excellent sport, both in himselfe and others, he is just
like a Pilchard, but his fins larger, both in breadth &amp; length, &amp; as long as
they are wett, so long he flyes; and for their mortall enemies the birds,
they continue with us from 33. degrees til we come to 15. and then
leave us.</P>
<P>At which time and place, another kinde undertakes us, not much
bigger then a Castrill; and as near that colour as may bee, but of ano∣ther
manner of flying: for these flye close to the water, and turne about
every wave; so that wee often lose sight of them, by interposing of
the waves, and think somtimes that a wave has overwhelmed her.
The pleasure she gives the eye, is by the giddinesse of her flying, and
often seems to be lost: and yet (contrary to our expectation) appears
againe. But I will trouble you no longer with the inhabitants of
the Plyant Aire, but dive into the Deep, to try what pleasure that E∣lement
affords to give you delight.</P>
<P>There is a Fish called a Sharke, which he as is a common enemy to
Saylers and all others that venture, in Calmes, to commit their naked
bodies to the sea (for he often bites off Legs, sometimes Armes, and
now and then swallowes the whole body, if the Fish bee great): So
when the Saylers take them, they use them accordingly. Sometimes
by putting out their eyes, and throwing them over bord; sometimes
by mangling and cutting their bodies, finns, and tayles, making them
a prey to others, who were mercilesse Tyrants themselves; And in
this kind of justice they are very Accurate.</P>
<P>Many of these fishes we took; some by striking with harping Irons,
some with Fishgigs, some with hookes; and amongst the rest, one
very large, which followed the Ship foure houres, before wee went
about to take him; and perceived before him, a little Fish which they
call the <HI>Pilot Fish;</HI> This little guide of his, swims sometimes a yeard
before him, sometimes more or lesse, at his pleasure; and in his greatest-adversity
often cleaves to him, and like a deare friend, stickes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lo∣sest
when hee needs him most: for when he is taken, this little fish,
never fayles to fasten himselfe to his head, or some part neere that,
and resolves to dye with him. The experience of this wee found
not only in this great fish, but in all the rest wee had formerly taken,
for wee never took the one without the other. And the Engine
wee took this great Sharke with, was a large Hook, baited with a
piece of Beef; which he received into his mouth, his belly being
turned upwards, for his mouth being short of his snout a good deale,
he could not take it conveniently, his back being upward, by reason
his snout drove the line afore it, but as soon as wee perceived the
baite to be swallowed, we gave a sudden pull, which fastned the hook
so, as we were sure the weight of his body would not teare it out,
Wee drew him up, and laid him in the Wast of the Ship, where none
durst abide, but the Seamen who dare doe any thing.</P>
<P>Wee had aboard divers mastive Dogges, and amongst them, one so
large and fierce, as I have seldome seen any like him; this Dogge flew
to him with the greatest Courage that might be, but could take no
hold of him, by reason of his large roundnesse and sliminesse; but if by
chance he got hold of one of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>innes, the Sharke would throw him
from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ide to side of the Ship, as if he had been nothing; and doubtlesse
if he had encountred him in his own Element, the Sea, he would have
made quick work with him.</P>

<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
<P>Divers of this kind wee took, but none so large; he was about 16
foot long, and 10 foot about the middle. Other fishes were took,
as the <HI>Bonito,</HI> the <HI>Spanish Maquerell,</HI> the <HI>Albucore, Dolphin, &amp;c.</HI> which
wee found excellent meate, but especially the <HI>Albucore,</HI> which is a fish
of such a shape, as it pleased me much to look on. Those wee took
were not much above a yard long, with forked tayles, the gristles
very firme and strong, and the body neer that, no bigger then a mans
wrist; but suddenly growing upward to such a greatnesse, as I have
seldome seen any like him, and so strong withall, as a sayler a very
strong man, holding one of them fast by the gill, when this fish
mov'd but his tayle to get loose, gave such a spring, as he had like to
have put his arme out of joynt. These kind of fishes, in a cleare Sun∣shine
evening, delight themselves and us, by trying which of them
can leap highest above water, so that tis a pretty pastime, to see fishes
so large, and gloriously colour'd, shew themselves so far above their na∣turall
Element, whose shapes and colours gave such variety. But this
sport we saw not often.</P>
<P>I will trouble you no more, with mentioning the variety of shapes
and colours of fishes, till I come to St. <HI>Jago;</HI> onely one, and that a very
small one; for his body is not much bigger then a large Pomegranate,
and yet his faculties are such, as may draw more eyes to look on him
and more mindes to consider him, then the Vast <HI>Whale:</HI> for though
it be true, that his large body, appearing above the surface of the water
being in calmes a smooth leavell superficies, and suddenly appearing,
is one of the strangest and most monstrous sights that can be in nature;
(and the more admirable, when he is incounted by his two mortall
enemies, the <HI>Sword</HI> and <HI>Theshal</HI> fishes. For to shake them off, he
leapes more then his owne length, above water, and in his fall,
beats the sea with such violence, as the froth and foame is seen a
quarter of an houre after, White, as when tis beaten by a strong
West wind against a Rock; and at other times, spouts out the water
in great quantities; the height of an ordinary Steeple.) Yet this great
master-piece of Nature, is not in my opinion so full of wonder, nor
doth raise the consideration to such a height: as this little fish the
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arvill,</HI> who can when he pleases, enjoy himselfe with his neighbour
fishes, under water; And when he putts on a resolution to
trie his fortune in another Element, the <HI>Ayer,</HI> he riseth to the top
of the sea, let the billow go never so high, and there without the help
of a say<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, Raises up his maine Mast, spreads his sayles, which he
makes of his own sinewes, fits his Rudder and Ballast, and begins his
voyage; But to what Coast he is bound, or what trafique he intends,
himselfe and He that made him onely can tell. Fishes there are none
to prey on, nor flies, and therefore tis not for food he travailes; I have
seen them 500 leagues from any land, if his voyage be to any Port, he
must have a long time and much patience to get thither; if to sea, hee's
there already; in one thing he hath the advantage of any ship that
ever sayled: for he can go neerer the wind by a poynt, then the most
yare Friggot that ever was built. Which shewes how farre Nature
can exceed Art. Another advantage he has, that in the greatest
Tempest, he never feares drowning. Compasse, nor Card he needs
not, for he is never out of his way; whether then his voyage be for
pleasure or profit we are yet to seeke.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
<P>But before wee arive at our next Harbour, St <HI>Jago,</HI> one of the <HI>Iles</HI> of
Cape Verd, and now revolted from the King of Spayne, to the Portu∣gall;
Let me tell you, one little observation I made of the Ships way;
which in slacke windes, and darke nights, wee saw nothing under
water, but darkenes▪ but in stiffe windes, and strong gayles, wee saw
perfectly the keele of the Ship; and fishes playing underneath, as
lighted by a torch, and yet the nights of equall darkenes. Which put
me in mind of a poynt of Philosophy I had heard discourst of, a∣mong
the Learned; That in the Ayer, Rough hard bodies, meeting
with one another, by violent stroakes, Rarifie the Ayer, so as to make
fire. So here, the ship being of a hard substance, and in a violent
motion, meeting with the strong resistance of the waves: (who though
they bee not hard, yet they are rough, by reason of their saltnes,)
doe cause a light, though no fire, and I may guesse, that that light
would bee fire, were it not quencht by the sea, in the instant it is
made; which in his owne Element, hath the greater power and pre∣dominancie.</P>
<P>But before wee came to St <HI>Jago,</HI> wee were to have visited a small
Iland called <HI>Soll;</HI> by the intreatie of a Portugall wee carried with us,
whose name was <HI>Bernardo Mendes de Sousa;</HI> who pretended, to have a
great part of the Iland (if not the whole) to bee his owne;
but for that, it lay somewhat out of our waye, and wee could not
recover it, by reason the winde was Crosse; and partly for that
wee were enformed by some of the Saylers, who told us it was unin∣habited
by any, but Goats, Dogs, and the like; and wee guest, hee
would (out of a vaine glorie) shew us something that he Call'd his.
But the Master, who well knew the Condition of the place, would
not lose so much tyme to no purpose. Which gave some discontent∣ment
to the Portugall, which hee exprest in his Countenance, by a
sullen dogged looke, till wee came to St <HI>Jago.</HI> But that was but a
whetstone, to sharpen a worse humour hee was big with; for though
our Merchants redeem'd him out of prison in <HI>London,</HI> intending
him a Mayne director in the whole voyage; whose Credulous eares hee
highly abused, by telling them, That the <HI>Padre Vagado</HI> (Chiefe Go∣vernour
of St <HI>Jago)</HI> was his brother, and that by the power hee had
with him, to lay all trade open, for Negroes, Horses, and Cattle,
which were there Contrabanded goods; By which perswasion, they
gave him the power and Command of the ship and goods. But hee in∣tended
nothing lesse then the performance of that trust, but instead
of it, meant to make prey of both, and of our Liberties, and probably
lives to boote, if wee had not bin verie wary of him.</P>
<P>The first thing wee perceiv'd in him, was a strange looke hee put
on, when wee came nere the Iland; which caused us to suspect some
great and bad designe hee was bent on, (for being Iolly and very good
Companie all the voyage, to change his Countenance when wee were
nere the place where wee hop'd to enjoy our selves with happinesse
and Contentment, was a presage of some evill intent to bee put in
practice, which howerly wee expected; and were all at gaze what part
of it was first to bee acted; which hee (more speedily then hee nee∣ded)
discovered, and it was thus.</P>
<P>Our water, being a good part spent in our passage thither, and wee
being to make new and large provisions for the remaynder of our
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
Voyage, carrying horses and Cattle with us: which wee were to take
in there; hee Commanded the Master by the power he had over him,
to send a shoare all the emptie Caske hee had aboard; with intent to
detayne them; and so make us comply, by little and little to his ends.
But the Master absolutely denied the Landing our great Caske, but
told him he would send our quarter Caskes, in our long boate, and
so by making often returnes, to fill our Pipes &amp; Buts. But finding him∣self
at a losse in this designe, thought good to keepe us from any water
at all; and so appointed our men, to dig in the valley under the
Padres house, where he was well assured no Springs of water were
to be found. But some of our men, who spoke good Spanish, by their
enquiries heard, That there was a very good well on the other side of
the hill, under the Castle, and were brought to the sight of it by
some of the Country people; Which when he perceiv'd we had know∣ledge
of, he was much out of Countenance, and used his best elo∣quence
to make us beleeve he had never heard of that Well.</P>
<P>So finding that this practice would not serve his turne, he tryed
another: and that was was to command our Master, to carrie a shoare,
that part of the Cargosoone that was consign'd for that place, which
was Cloath, Bayes, Stuffes of severall kindes, Linen Cloath, Hats with
broad brims, such as Spaniards use to weare, and were made in Lon∣don
purposely to put off there, and these goods being valued, when
they were receiv'd at Land, there should be a returne made, in Horses,
and Cattle. But as we had Cause to suspect him for the Cask, so wee
had for the Cargo, and so return'd him this answer, that we would
not land any of our goods, without receiving the like valew in Cat∣tle;
and so by parcells to receive the one, and deliver the other,</P>
<P>On which message, we sent the Purser of our ship, that spoke good
Spanish; But <HI>Bernardo,</HI> being vext to the height that his Plot was dis∣covered,
kept him prisoner. We sent another to demand him which
was like wise detayned, then we sent 3 or 4 more and some of the sol∣diers
of the Castle gave fire upon them, Soe that wee resolv'd to weigh
Anchor and put to Sea for a weeke or tenne dayes and returne in the
night (the weather being darke and fitt for our purpose) and surprise
the Padres house with 50 Musketeers which we could muster verie
well of the Gentlemen and other passengers in the ship, and some of
the Saylers, and take the <HI>Padre Vagago,</HI> and <HI>Bernardo Mendes de Sousa,</HI>
and carrie them to the <HI>Barbados.</HI> But the Padre not knowing of this
designe in <HI>Bernardo,</HI> sent to us a verie kind message inviting himselfe
aboard our ship, receiving hostages from us, and soe upon treatie
with him aboard, settled a trade, and got our prisoners releast; where∣upon
we were invited to his house or rather his Rocke, for it was most
part of it form'd in a Rocke, with a sleep and verie high precipice.</P>
<P>But I am mislead into this digression by this wicked Portugall,
whose unlucky Countenance before we came to the <HI>Iland,</HI> gave me
the occasion to say somewhat of him, and his miscariage in the <HI>Iland,</HI>
before I came at it.</P>
<P>But when we came within sight of it, it appeared to us full of high &amp;
steep Rocks, (the highest of which were meere stone, without any
soyleat all) and they of so great a height, as we seldome saw the
tops, whilst we lay before it; being interposed by mists, and Clouds:
which rise and darken the skie in the time of the <HI>Turnado.</HI> But the day
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
we had the first sight of it, being very cleare; and we being at a com∣petent
distance, had a perfect view of it). But those of the second al∣titude,
appear'd not so white, but had a grayish colour, as if covered
with light and sandy earth. But the lowest of those, seem'd rather
Hills, than Rockes; but yet so russet, as we were in doubt whether
grasse did ever grow on them. But when we came within distance of
discerning colours perfectly; wee expected the vallies, as it opened to
us, would have afforded our eyes a richer prospect, with more variety
of colours, but we found very little or no amendment, onely the trees
of <HI>Coconuts,</HI> with some other that were large and beautiful, whose tops
(giving amply proportionable shadowes to their roots) held their
greennesse and were extreame beautifull. But the time of our stay
there, being the <HI>Turnado,</HI> when the sunne (being in his returne from
the Tropique of Cancer, to that of Capricorne, to visit and refresh
the Southern world,) became <HI>Zenith</HI> to the inhabitants of that part
of the world; which is about the beginning of <HI>August:</HI> At which time
the raines fall in abundance, and is accompted winter, to those parts
where the <HI>Zenith</HI> is, and we staying there 19 or 20 dayes, (the raine
falling a good part of that time,) wee perceived the valleys to put on
new liveries: so fresh, so full of various greens, intermixt with flowers
of severall kinds, some growing on stalkes, some on trees, so full of
varietie, of the most beautifull colours, as if nature had made choyce
of that place to shew her Master piece. So that, having feasted our
eyes with this delighted object, we desired to try whether their smel
was as pleasant and odoriferous, as their beauty was admirable; and to
satisfie our selves of this curiosity, would willingly have gone a shoare
but wee were advised to stay a little, till we were better assured of
our <HI>Portugall Bernardo.</HI> Which stay, gave us time to take a view of
the Harbour or <HI>Bay,</HI> which they call the <HI>Pry,</HI> and is about a league
over from land to land. And, as I guest, somewhat more; from the
poynts of land, to the bottome; and, as we enter, we leave a small Iland
on our Larboard side.</P>
<P>This <HI>Bay</HI> or <HI>Pry,</HI> lies to the <HI>Leeward</HI> of the Iland; by reason whereof
we found so great, so insufferable heate, as you will hardly imagine
that bodyes comming out of cold Climates, could indure such scor∣ching
without being suffocated.</P>
<P>I had in a Cabinet two pieces of hard waxe, in the hold of the ship
both mel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed and clave together; and the Cement of that Cabinet,
that was made to hold the Inke, melted and became flat.</P>
<P>So that finding the <HI>Ayer</HI> so torridly hot, I thought good to make
triall of the water; and I leapt into the sea, which appeared to my sense
no more colder than the <HI>Ayer;</HI> than the Queens bath (at <HI>Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he)</HI> is
hotter in <HI>June</HI> here in England.</P>
<P>At the bottome, or inward part of the <HI>Pry,</HI> there appeared to us, a
faire round rising hill, neere halfe the bredth of the <HI>Pry,</HI> not much unlike
the How at <HI>Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mouth,</HI> with a valley on either side; And on the brow of
the Hill towards the right hand, a very high and steep precipice of a
rocke; in which stood the house of the <HI>Padre Vagado,</HI> fixt on the top of
the rocke. A house fit enough for such a Master; for though he were
the chiefe Commander of the Iland: yet by his port and house he kept
he was more like a <HI>Hermite</HI> then a Governour. His familie consisting
of a <HI>Mollotto</HI> of his own getting, three Negroes, a Fidler, and a Wench.
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
Himselfe a man grave enough to be wise, but certainly of no great lear∣ning;
for upon the differences between <HI>Bernardo</HI> and us, Colonel <HI>Modiford</HI>
writ him a letter in Latin, which he did his best endeavour to answer
but fell two bowes short in substance and language, and though
his Quarrell were to us, yet he revenged himselfe on <HI>Priscian,</HI> whose
head he broke 3 or 4 times in his letter.</P>
<P>The first time we saw him, was at his own house, by his own invi∣tation:
to which almost inaccessible habitation, when we had climed
with infinite difficulty; and indeed so painfull and violent was our
motion: (our leggs finding the motion of elevation, much more vio∣lent
then of distention,) as we were almost scalded within, and the
torrid heat of the Sun, being then our <HI>Zenith,</HI> did so scald us with∣out,
as we were in fitter condition to be fricased for the <HI>Padres</HI> dinner,
then to eat any dinner our selves.</P>
<P>Being painfully and pipeing hot, arriv'd at this exalted mansion; we
found none to entertaine us but <HI>Bernardo;</HI> whose countenance was
not so well reconcil'd to himselfe, as to give us a hearty welcome. He
told us that the <HI>Padre</HI> was gone forth about some affaires of the Iland,
but would returne time enough to dinner. And whilst we were staying
there, expecting his comming, we thought good not to be idle, for
the structure of that Fabricke, did not minister to our eyes much of
delight. Onely that it had a faier prospect to sea. So we walkt
along upon that round hill, enquiring what we could of the place;
and were inform'd that there had been formerly a very stately Town,
beautified with faire buildings, and streets so contrived, as to make
the best use of such a prospect; But burnt and demolisht by Sr. Fran∣cis
<HI>Drake,</HI> in the time of the warres, between Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and the
King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> which made us give more reverence to the place; for
that some of our Countreymen had there sacrificed their lives for the
Honour of our Nation.</P>
<P>About the houre that our stomacks told us, it was full high time to
pay Nature her due, we lookt about us, and perceived at a good di∣stance,
a horse comming towards us, with a man on his back, as hard
as his heels could carry him; and within a very little time, made a
sudden stop at the <HI>Padres</HI> house, from whose backe (being taken by
two <HI>Negroes,)</HI> was set on the ground a great fat man, with a gowne on
his back, his face not so black as to be counted a <HI>Mollotto,</HI> yet I believe
full out as black as the Knight of the Sunne; his eyes blacker if possi∣ble,
and so far sunk into his head, as with a large pinne you might
have prick't them out in the nappe of his necke. Upon his a lighting
we perceived him very much discomposed, for the pace he rid, was
not his usuall manner of riding, as by our enquiry afterwards we
understood; and that he very seldom rid at all, but his business having
held him over long, caus'd him to take horse, who intended to come
a foot; and being m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nted, (and he none of the best horsemen,)
was made subject to the wil of his horse; which being a Barbe, &amp; very
swift of foot, comming towards the place where he was kept, ranne
with such violence, as it was a wonder his burthen had not been cast
by the way; for the Horse having a bit in his mouth, and the stirrops
being extreame short, as the manner of their riding there is, if he had
ever checkt him with the bridle, that he had been put to bound, he
had undoubtedly layd him on the ground. But the rider that thought
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
of nothing more, then holding fast by the pummell with both handes,
was miraculously preserv'd.</P>
<P>In this great discomposure, he was taken off by two <HI>Negroes,</HI> and set
on his owne legs: but in such a trance, as for some minutes, he
was not in a Condition to speake to us: So sensible an impression had
the feare of falling made in him. But being at last come to himselfe,
he made his addresse to us, and in his language bid us welcome, begin∣ing
to excuse his too long stay: to redeeme which fault, he had put
himselfe in such a hazard, as in his whole life he had not knowne the
like. We answered, that it argued a great respect and civilitie to us,
that he would expose his gravitie, which was accustomed to a moder∣ate
pace, to such a swiftnes of motion, as might in any kinde indan∣ger
his health, or hazard his person. But he being a man much re∣serv'd,
and slow of language, said no more; but brought us into his
house; which was upon a Levell at the entrance, but the other side
of the Rooms a steep precipice, and some of the roomes like galleries-such
as are in the meanest <HI>Innes</HI> upon <HI>London</HI>-way. There were
not in the house above 4 roomes, besides two galleries and a Kitchin;
and those all on a flower; and the flowers of earth, not so much as
made Levell, nor soeeven as to deserve sweeping; and the most of
them were justly dealt withall: for they had no more then they de∣serv'd,
both above and below; for the Cobwebs serv'd for hang∣ings,
and frying pans and gred-irons for pictures.</P>
<P>By this equipage, you may guesse what the trading is of this <HI>Iland,</HI>
when the Governour is thus accoutred; but by and by, a Cloath was
layde, of Calico, with 4 or 5 Napkins of the same, to serve a dozen
men. The first Course was set on the table, usherd in by the Padre
himselfe, <HI>(Bernardo,</HI> the <HI>Mollotto,</HI> and <HI>Negroes</HI> following after,) with
every one a dish of fruite, 6 in all; the first was Millions, Plantines
the second, the third Bonanos, the 4 of Guavers, the 5 of Prickled
Peares, the 6 the Custard Apple: but to fill up the table, and make the
feast yet more sumptuous, the Padre sent his <HI>Mollotto,</HI> into his own
Chamber, for a dish which he reserv'd for the Close of all the rest;
Three <HI>Pines</HI> in a dish, which were the first that ever I had seene, and as
farre beyond the best fruite that growes in England, as the best <HI>Abricot</HI>
is beyond the worst Slow or Crab.</P>
<P>Having well refresht our selves with these excellent fruites, we
dranke a glasse or two of Red Sack; a kinde of wine growing in the
<HI>Maderas;</HI> verie strong, but not verie pleasant; for in this Iland, there
is made noe wine at all; nor as I thinke any of grapes, so neere the
Line upon Ilands in all the world. Having made an end of our fruite,
the dishes were taken away, and another Course fetcht in; which was
of flesh, fish, and sallets; the sallets being first plac't upon the table▪
which I tooke great heed of, being all Novelties to me, but the best
and most favourie herbs that ever I tasted, verie well season'd with
salt, Oyle, and the best vinagre. Severall sorts we had, but not mixt,
but in severall dishes, all strange, and all excellent▪ The first dish of
flesh, was a leg of young sturke, or a wilde Calfe, of a yeare old; which
was of the Colour of stags flesh, and tasted very like it, full of Nerves
and sinewes, strong meat and very well Condited: boyld tender, and
the sauce of savorie herbes, with Spanish Vinagre. Turkyes and Hens
we had roasted; a gigget of young goate, fish in abundance of severall
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
kindes, whose names I have forgotten, Snappers, grey and red; Ca∣vallos,
Carpions, &amp;c: with others of rare colours and shapes, too many
to be named in this leafe; some fryed in oyle, and eaten hot, some souc't,
some marinated: of all these we tasted, and were much delighted.</P>
<P>Dinner being neere halfe done, (the Padre, <HI>Bernardo,</HI> and the other
black atendants, waiting on us;) in comes an old fellow, whose com∣plexion
was raised out of the red Sack; for neare that Colour it was:
his head and beard milke white, his Countenance bold and Cheerfull,
a Lute in his hand, and plaide us for a Noveltie, The <HI>Passame sares
galiard;</HI> a tune in great esteeme, in Harry the fourths dayes; for when
Sir <HI>John Fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>taff</HI> makes his Amours to Mistresse <HI>Doll Tear-sheet, Sneake</HI>
and his Companie, the admired fidlers of that age, playes this tune,
which put a thought into my head, that if time and tune be the Com∣posits
of Musicke, what a long time this tune had in sayling from <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
to this place. But we being sufficiently satisfied with this kind of
harmonie, desired a song; which he performed in as Antique a manner;
both favouring much of Antiquitie; no Graces, double relishes,
Frillos, Grops or Piarro torte's, but plaine as a packstaffe; his Lute too,
was but of tenne strings, and that was in fashion in King Davids dayes;
soe that the raritie of this Antique piece, pleas'd me beyond mea∣sure.</P>
<P>Dinner being ended, and the Padre well neere wearie of his wayting,
we rose, and made roome for better Companie; for now the
Padre, and his blacke mistresse were to take their turnes; A Negro
of the greatest beautie and majestie together: that ever I saw in one
woman. Her stature large, and excellently shap't, well favour'd, full
eye'd, &amp; admirably grac't; she wore on her head a roll of green taffatie,
strip't with white and Philiamort, made up in manner of a Turban;
and over that a sleight vayle, which she tooke off at pleasure. On her
bodie next her linen, a Peticoate of Orange Tawny and Skye Colour;
not done with Straite stripes, but wav'd; and upon that▪ a mantle of
purple silke, ingrayld with straw Colour. This Man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le was large, and
tyed with a knot of verie broad black Ribbon, with a rich Jewell on
her right shoulder, which came under her left arme, and so hung loose
and carelesly, almost to the ground. On her Legs, she wore buskins of
wetched Silke, deckt with Silver lace, and Fringe; Her shooes, of
white Leather, lac't with skie colour; and pinkt between those laces.
In her eares, she wore Large Pendants, about her n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck; and on her
armes, fayre Pearles. But her eyes were her richest Iewells: for they
were the largest, and most orientall, that I have ever seene,</P>
<P>Seing all these perfections in her onely at passage, but not yet
heard her Speake; I was resolv'd after dinner, to make an Essay▪ what
a present of rich silver silke and gold Ribbon would doe, to perswade
her to open her lips: Partly out of a Curiositie, to see whether her
teeth were exactly white, and cleane, as I hop'd they were; for 'tis a
generall opinion, that all <HI>Negroes</HI> have white teeth; but that is a Com∣mon
error, for the black and white, being so neere together, they set
off on another with the greater advantage. But looke neerer to them,
and you shall find those teeth, which at a distance appear'd rarely
white, are yellow and foul. This knowledge wrought this Curiositie
in me, but it was not the mayne end of my enquirie; for there was
now, but one thing more, to set her off in my opinioni, the rarest black
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
swanne that I had ever seen, and that was her language, &amp; gracefull de∣livery
of that, which was to unite and confirme a perfection in all the
rest. And to that end I took a Gentleman that spoke good Spanish with
me, and awaited her comming out, which was with far greater majesty,
and gracefulness, then I have seen Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> descend from the
Chaire of State, to dance the Measures with a Baron of England, at
a Maske in the Banquetting house. And truly, had her followers and
friends, with other perquisits (that ought to be the attendants on such
a state and beautie) wayted on her, I had made a stop, and gone no far∣ther.
But finding her but slightly attended, and considering she was but
the Padres Mistres, &amp; therefore the more accessible, I made my addres∣ses
to her, by my interpreter; &amp; told her, I had some Trifles made by
the people of <HI>England,</HI> which for their value were not worthy her ac∣ceptance,
yet for their Novelty, they might be of some esteem, such ha∣ving
bin worn by the great Queens of <HI>Europe,</HI> &amp; intreated her to vouch∣safe
to receive them. She with much gravity, and reserv'dness, opened
the paper; but when she lookt on them, the Colours pleased her so, as she
put her gravity into the loveliest smile that I have ever seen. And then
shewed her rowes of pearls, so clean, white, Orient, and well shaped, as
<HI>Neptunes</HI> Court was never pav'd with such as these; &amp; to shew whether
was whiter, or more Orient, those or the whites of her eyes, she turn'd
them up, &amp; gave me such a look, as was a sufficient return for a far grea∣ter
present, and withall wisht, I would think of somewhat wherein she
might pleasure me, and I should finde her both ready and willing. And
so with a gracefull bow of her neck, she took her way towards her own
house; which was not above a stones cast from the <HI>Padres.</HI> Other addres∣ses
were not to be made, without the dislike of the <HI>Padre,</HI> for they
are there as jealous of their Mistrisses, as the <HI>Italians</HI> of their wives.</P>
<P>In the afternoon we took leave, and went aboard; where we re∣mained
three or four days; about which time, some passengers of the
ship, who had no great store of linnen for shift, desired leave to go
ashoare and took divers women along with them, to wash their linnen.
But (it seem'd) the <HI>Portugalls,</HI> and <HI>Negroes</HI> too, found them handsome
and fit for their turnes, and were a little Rude, I cannot say Ravisht
them; for the Major part of them, being taken from Bridewell, Turn∣boule
street, and such like places of education, were better natur'd
then to suffer such violence; yet complaints were made, when they
came aboard, both of such abuses, and stealing their linnen.</P>
<P>But such a praise they gave of the place, as we all were desirous
to see it: for, after the Raine, every day gave an increase to the beau∣ty
of the place, by the budding out of new fruits and flowers.</P>
<P>This was the valley on the left side of the Hill, more spacious and
beautifull by much than that on the right hand, where the <HI>Padre</HI>
dwelt. The next day, a dozen Gentlemen of our company, resolv'd
to go and see this so much admired valley, and when our Saylers with
their long boat went to fetch water, (as dayly they did,) we went
along with them: and landed there, in as high going Billows, as I have
ever seen, so near the land. Much adoe we had, to be carried to land
though on mens backs, and yet the grapple came as near the shoare as
they durst bring it, for bulging against the bottome.</P>
<P>No sooner were vve landed, but the Captaine of the Castle, with
one souldier vvith him; came tovvards us, vvith a slovv formall pace;
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
vvho desired to speake vvith one of us alone. Colonel <HI>Modiford,</HI> being
the chiefe man in the Company, went with an Interpreter to meet
him; and being at the distance of speech, desired to know his plea∣sure;
which he told him vvas this. That he understood divers of
our vvomen had bin ashoare, the day before; and received some in∣jury,
from the people of the Iland, and that it vvas conceiv'd, vve
were come Arm'd to take revenge on those that did the affront. He
therefore advised us, either to make speedy returne to the boate
that brought us: or to send back our svvords and pistols, and com∣mit
our selves to his protection; and if one of those vvere not present∣ly
put in act, vve should in a very short time have all our throats Cut.</P>
<P>We told him vve had no intention of revenge for any vvrong
done, and that the only cause of our landing, vvas to see the beauty
of the place vve had heard so much Commended, by our people that
were ashore, of which they had given a very large testimony, both of
the pleasantness and fruitfulness of it, and that our visit vvas out of
love, both to the place and people. But for sending our weapons back
to the boate, vve desired his pardon; for this reason, that the Billovvs
going so very high at that time, vve could not send them to the boat
vvithout being dipt in the Sea vvater, vvhich vvould spoyle them;
and the most of them, being rich svvords, and pistols, vve vvere loath
to have their beauty covered vvith rust, vvhich the salt vvater vvould
be the occasion of. We desired rather, that he would Command a
souldier of his, to stay with a man of ours, and keep them safe, till our
returne; which he being content to doe, we committed our selves to
his protection, who put a guard upon us of 10 Souldiers, part <HI>Portugalls</HI>
part <HI>Negroes;</HI> the most part of either kind, as proper men as I have
seen, and as handsomely cloathed.</P>
<P>Their garments made with much Art, and all seem'd to be done
by the Tayler; the Coverings for their heads, were not unlike Hel∣mits;
of blew and white strip't silke, some tawny, and yellow, others
of other sorts of Colours; but all of one fashion, their doublets close
to their bodies, with Cassocks, made of the fashion of the Kings guard:
loose sleeves, which came to their elbowes; but large and gathered so
as to sit loose from their armes; with foure large skirts, reaching down
to the middle of their thighs; but these of a different colour from their
suits, their breeches indifferently large, comming down below the
knee; and the upper part, so wrought with Whalebones within, as to
keep them hollow, fromtouching their backs; to avoid heat, which they
were much troubled with; upon their leggs, buskins of the colour of
their suits, yet some made a difference: their shooes Colour'd for the
most part; some white, but very few blacke. Their weapons, as
Swords, Pistols, Muskets, Pikes, and Partisans, kept very bright, and
worne comelily and gracefully; which argued a decencie in the Com∣mander,
as their awfull respect did of his austeritie.</P>
<P>Being now under a Guard, we marcht into this valley, one of the
delightfullest places that I have ever seen, for besides the high and
loftie trees, as the <HI>Palmeto, Royall, Coco, Cedar, Locust, Masticke, Mangrave▪
Bully, Redwood, Pickled yellow wood, Cassia, Fistula, Calibash, Cherry, Figgtree,</HI>
whose body is large inough for timber, <HI>Cittrons, Custard apple, Gnavers,
Macow, Cipres, Oranges, Limons, Lymes, Pomegranat, A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>otto, Prickled apple,
Prickled peare, Papa,</HI> these and more may be accounted wood: and yet a
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
good part of them bearing excellent fruit; But then there are of a
lesser sort, that beare the rarest fruit; whose bodyes cannot be ac∣compted
wood, as the Plantine, Pine, Bonano, Milon, water Milon,
&amp;c. and some few grapes, but those inconsiderable, by reason they
can never make wine: because they have no winter, and so by that
meanes, they can never ripe together, but one is green, another ripe,
another rotten, which reason will ever hold, that no wine can be made
on Ilands, where there is no winter: or within twenty degrees of the
line on either side. I have heard that wine is made in the <HI>East Indies,</HI>
within lesse then fifteen Degrees; but tis of the Palme tree; out of
whose body, they draw both wine and oyle; which wine will not
keep above a day, but no wine of grapes, for the reasons afore said,
Other kinds of trees, we found good to smell to, as Mirtle, Jesaman,
Tamarisk, with a tree somewhat of that bignesse, bearing a very
beautifull flower. The first halfe next the stalke, of a deep yellow
or gold colour; the other halfe, being the larger, of a rich Scarlet: shap'd
like a Garnation, &amp; when the flowers fall off, there grows a Cod, with 7
or 8 seeds in it, divers of which, we carried to the <HI>Barbados,</HI> and planted
there: and they grew and multiplied abundantly, and they call them
there, the St. <HI>Jago</HI> flower, which is a beautifull, but no sweet flower.</P>
<P>From these woods of pleasant trees, we saw flying divers birds, some
one way, some another, of the fairest, and most beautifull colours,
that can be imagined in Nature: others whose Colours and shapes come
short of these, did so excell in sweetnesse, and loudness of voyce, as
our Nightingals in England, are short of them, in either of those
two properties; but in variety of tunes, our birds are beyond them,
for in that they are defective.</P>
<P>In this valley of pleasure, adorn'd as you have heard, we march't
with our Guard, faire and softly, near a quarter of a mile; before we
came to the much praised fountaine; from whence we fetcht our
water. The circle whereof, was about 60 foot, the Diameter about
20 from the ground to the top of the Well, (which was of freestone,)
3 foot and a halfe; from thence within, downe to the surface of the
water, about 15 foot. The spring it selfe, not so much to be prai∣sed
for the excellency of the taste, though cleare inough, as for the
Nymphs that repaire thither. For whilst we stayed there seeing the Say∣lers
full their Casks; and withall Contemplating the glory of the
place: there appeard to our view, many pretie young Negro Virgins,
playing about the Well. But amongst those; two, that came downe
with either of them a naturall Pitcher, a Calibash upon their arme, to
fetch water from this fountaine. Creatures, of such shapes, as would
have puzzelld <HI>Albert Durer,</HI> the great Mr of Proportion, but to have
imitated; and <HI>Tition,</HI> or <HI>Andrea de Sarta,</HI> for softnes of muscles, and
Curiositie of Colouring, though with a studied diligence; and a love
both to the partie and the worke. To expresse all the perfections of
Nature, and Parts, these Virgins were owners of, would aske a more
skillfull pen, or pencill then mine; Sure I am, though all were excell∣ent,
their motions were the highest, and that is a beautie no painter
can expresse, and therefore my pen may well be silent; yet a word or
two, would not be amisse, to expresse the difference between these,
and those of high <HI>Africa;</HI> as of Morcoco, Guinny, Binny, Cut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>how,
Angola, Aethiopia, and <HI>Mauritania,</HI> or those that dwell nere the <HI>River</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
of <HI>Gambia,</HI> who are thick lipt, short nos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, and commonly low fore∣heads.
But these, are compos'd of such features, as would marre the
judgment of the best Paynters, to undertake to mend. Wanton, as the
soyle that bred them, sweet as the fruites they fed on; for being come
so neere, as their motions, and graces might perfectly be discern'd, I
guest that Nature could not, without help of Art, frame such ac∣complisht
beauties not onely of colours, and favour, but of motion too,
which is the highest part of beautie. If dancing had bin in fashion in
this <HI>Iland,</HI> I might have been perswaded, that they had bin taught
those motions, by some who had studied that Art. But considering the
<HI>Padre's Musique</HI> to be the best the <HI>Iland</HI> afforded, I could not but cast
away that thought, and attribute all to pure nature; Innocent, as
youthfull, their ages about 15. Seing their beauties so fresh and youth∣full,
withall the perfections I have named, I thought good to trie, whe∣ther
the uttering of their language, would be as sweet and harmoni∣ous,
as their other partes were comely. And by the helpe of a Gentle∣man
that spoke <HI>Portugall,</HI> I accosted them; and began to praise their
beauties, shapes, and manner of dressings; which was extreamly pret∣tie.
Their haire not shorne as the <HI>Negroes</HI> in the places I have named,
close to their heads; nor in quarters, and mases, as they use to weare
it, which is ridiculous to all that see them, but themselves: But in a
due proportion of length, so as having their shotenings by the natu∣rall
Curles, they appeared as wiers, and artificiall dressings to their
faces. On the sides of their Cheeks, they plat little of it, of purpose to
tie small Ribbon; or some small beads, of white Amber, or blew
bugle, sometimes of the rare flowers that grow there; Their eares
hung with Pendants, their necks and armes adorn'd with bracelets of
Counterfeit pearles, and blew bugle; such as the <HI>Portugalls</HI> bestow on
them, for these are free <HI>Negroes,</HI> and weare upon the small of one of
their legs, the badge of their freedome; which is a small peece of sil∣ver,
or tinne, as big as the stale of a spoone; which comes round about
the leg: and by reason of the smoothnes, and lightnes, is no impedi∣ment
to their going. Their cloathes, were petticoates of Strip't silk,
next to their linen, which reach to their midle leg: and upon that a
mantle, of blew taffitie, tied with a Ribbon on the right shoulder:
which coming under the left arme, hung downe carelesly somewhat
lower then the petticoate, so as a great part of the naturall beautie, of
their backes and necks before, lay open to the view, their breast
round, firme, and beautifully shaped.</P>
<P>Upon my addresses to them, they appeard a little disturb'd; and
whispered to one another, but had not the Confidence to speake aloud
I had in my hat, a piece of silver and silke Ribbon, which I perceiv'd
their well shap't eyes, often to dart at; but their modesties would not
give them Confidence to aske. I tooke it out, and divided it between
them, which they accepted with much alacritie; and in returne,
dranke to one another my health in the liquor of the pure fountaine,
which I perceiv'd by their wantons miles, and jesticulations, and cast∣ing
their eyes towards me: vvhen they thought they had exprest en∣ough
they vvould take in their Countenances, and put themselves in
the modestest postures that could be, but vve having brought a
Cafe of bottles, of English spirits, vvith us; I cald for some, and
drunke a health to them, in a small dramme cup; and gave it to one
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
of them; vvhich they smelt to, and finding it too strong for their tem∣per,
pour'd some of it into one of their Calibashes: and put to it as
much vvater, as vvould temper it to their palats; they dranke againe,
but all this vvould not give them the Confidence to speake, but, in
mute language, and extream prety motions, shewed, they wanted
neither wit nor discretion, to make an answer. But it seem'd, it was
not the fashion there, for young Maides to speak to strangers, in so
publick a place.</P>
<P>I thought I had been sufficiently arm'd with the perfections I found
in the <HI>Padre</HI>'s Mistresse, as to be free from the darts of any other Beau∣ty
of that place, and in so short a time: But I found the difference be∣tween
young fresh Beauties, and those that are made up with the
addition of State and Majesty: For though they counsell and per∣swade
our Loves; yet, young Beauties force, and so commit rapes up∣on
our affections. In summe, had not my heart been fixed fast in my
breast, and dwelt there above sixty years, and therefore loath to leave
his long kept habitation, I had undoubtedly left it between them for
a Legacy. For, so equall were there Beauties, and my Love, as it was
not, nor could be, particular to either.</P>
<P>I have heard it a question disputed, whether if a Horse, being
plac'd at an equall distance, between two bottles of hey, equally
good; and his appetite being equally fix'd upon either: Whether that
Horse must not necessarily starve. For, if he feed on either, it must ar∣gue,
that his appetite was more fixt on that; or else, that bottle was
better than the other. Otherwise, what should move him to chose
one before the other?</P>
<P>In this posture was I, with my two Mistresses; or rather, my two
halves of one Mistresse: for, had they been conjoyned, and so made
one, the poynt of my Love had met there; but, being divided, and
my affection not forked, it was impossible to fix, but in one Centre.</P>
<P>In this doubtfull condition, I took my leave, with an assurance,
that I should never finde two such parallel Paragons, in my whole
search through the World: And the reason of their so great like∣nesse
and lustre, was, they were Sisters and Twins; as I was after
informed by a Hermite, that came often to visit us, when we came on
land, as we often did, and not far off from his Cell.</P>
<P>But you will think it strange, that a man of my age and gravity,
should have so much to do with Beauty and Love: But I have three
arguments to protect me. The first is, I have in my younger dayes,
been much inclined to Painting, in which Art, colour, favour, and
shape is exercised; and these Beauties, being a proper subject of all
these perfections, (being in themselves perfect) I could not but con∣sider
them with a studied diligence.</P>
<P>Next, I had been long at Sea, without setting foot on any Land;
and that hath a property, to make all Land-objects beautifull; and
these being in the highest degree paramount, could not but surprise
my fancy. Besides, the place being extream beautifull and lovely,
could not but secretly harbour in it the Spirit of Love, a passion not
to be governed. And therefore I hope, you will pardon my wilde ex∣travagancy.</P>
<P>But the main reason of this flying out, is, I had little else to say: for
the Iland, being a place of very little or no traffick, could not afford
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
much of discourse. Cattle they have very good, and large, which
they sell at very easy rates; and likewise Horses, of excellent shapes
and mettle; but they are contrabanded goods, and whosoever deales
in them, (without speciall license) forfeits both Ship and Goods, if
they have power to compell them.</P>
<P>But I believe, they have not, being partly informed by the Her∣mite,
who came often to us, to hear newes, and beg somewhat of us;
which being obtained, he would not stick to impart somewhat of the
weaknesse of the Iland, that would have cost him dear, if it had been
known to the <HI>Padre.</HI> And some of that which he enformed us, was,
that the Forts, and Block-houses, on either side the Prye, on which
we saw the appearance of Ordnances, good store, and large; but we
understood by him, that those Forts were neither regular, nor the
Guns Brasse or Iron, but such as <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth took <HI>Bulloyne</HI> with;
and this we found by experience to be true: For, upon our first diffe∣rence
with <HI>Barnardo,</HI> and the <HI>Padre,</HI> we weyed Anchor, and removed
our selves out of the distance of the Castle, which stood in the bot∣tom
of the Prye; and expected to have been shot at from those Forts
and Block-houses, but saw no fire given; and if they had been fur∣nish'd
with such Artillery as would have reach'd us, we should certain∣ly
have heard from them.</P>
<P>We also enquired of our Intelligencer, the Hermite, what Trades
or Manufactures were practised there; but were answered, that they
were few, and inconsiderable; Sugar, Sweet-meats, and Coco-nuts,
being the greatest trade they had. Yet by the <HI>Padres</HI> leave, we carried
away with us 50 head of Cattle, and 8 Horses, which <HI>Barnardo</HI> made
us pay double for; the usuall price being 25 s. a piece, for which he
made us pay 50 s. and for Horses, 10 l. a piece, which others have
had for 4 or 5 l. But he was content, we should rate our commodities
accordingly, and so we were no great losers by the exchange.</P>
<P>Having dispatch'd our businesse, we got leave to go ashoar, upon
the little Iland, at the entrance of the Prye, there to cut and pull
grasse, for our Horses and Cattle, which we made up into hay; a
work quickly done, where so much Sun-shine was our helper. It be∣ing
perfectly dried, we stowed it in the ship, which was our last work,
and so wayed Anchor, and hoysed Saile, steering our course for the
<HI>Barbadoes,</HI> leaving <HI>Bernardo</HI> (according to his own desire) behinde us;
having but 2 Degrees to the southward to varie, in the running of
620 Leagues Westward. St. <HI>Jago</HI> lying in 15. and the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> in
13 Degrees and 30 Minutes, to the Northward of the Line.</P>
<P>There are seven more Ilands, which are called the Ilands of <HI>Cape
Verd: viz.</HI> S. <HI>Michaels,</HI> St. <HI>Vincents,</HI> St. <HI>Anthonies,</HI> St. <HI>Lucia, Bravo, Fogo,</HI>
and <HI>Soll:</HI> Some of which are much larger, but none so considerable, as
this of St. <HI>Jago.</HI></P>
<P>As we lay at Anchor in the entrance of the Prye, we perceived at
Sun-set, between the Sun and us, the Iland called <HI>Fogo;</HI> which was at
such a distance, as none of us could discern it all the day, till that
houre; and then the Iland interposing between the Sun and us, we saw
it perfectly, shap'd like the neather half of a Sugar loafe, the upper half
being cut off eeven; and in the midst of the top of that, a smoak and
fire rising out, from which we guest it took its name.</P>
<P>About the tenth of <HI>August,</HI> we put out to Sea; and as we sayled, we
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>
left the Iland of our Starbord-side, and did not part with the sight of it,
till we discern'd a little Town, near to the shoar, which, we were told,
was the best in the Iland, and a place meant for the chief Port, for all
Traffick in the Iland; but by means of a great mischiefe, that Ships were
subject to in that Harbour, it was almost totally deserted: For the Sea
there, was so rocky in the bottome, and those rocks so thick together,
and sharp withall, as they cut the Cables off neer to the Anchor, and so
the Anchor often left in the bottom. There was a Dutchman that lay
there but three daies, and in that little stay, lost two Anchors. From
this Iland to the <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> we account 620 Leagues; which, by reason
of the constancy of the Windes, which blow seldome in any other point,
than Nore-east and By-east, they have usually sayled it in 16 or 17
daies. But we, for that it was the time of <HI>Tornado,</HI> when the windes
chop about into the South, were somewhat retarded in our passage, and
made it twenty two daies ere we came thither; and many have made it a
far longer time. For, in the time of <HI>Tornado,</HI> the clouds interpose so thick,
and darken the skie so much, as we are not able to make an observation
for a fortnight together; and so being doubtfull of our Latitude, dare
not make the best use of our Sayles and way, for fear of slipping by the
Island; and being past it, can hardly beat it up again, without putting
out into the Main, and so by painfull traverses, recover our selves to the
Eastward of the Iland, and then fall back again, by the due Latitude
upon it, at 13 Degrees and 30 Minutes.</P>
<P>Besides this paines, and losse of time, when we misse the Iland, we
many times run hazards, by falling upon the Leeward Ilands, in the
night, of which the Bay of <HI>Merixo</HI> is well stor'd.</P>
<P>In this long reach, (which may be call'd a voyage it selfe) I had only
two things to make the way seem short; the one was Pleasure, the other
Businesse; that of Pleasure, was, to view the Heavens, and the beauty of
them, which were objects of so great glory, as the Inhabitants of the
World, from 40 Degrees to either Pole, can never be witnesse of. And
this happens at the time, when the <HI>Turnado</HI> is with those of that Lati∣tude,
where we were. For the clouds being exhal'd in great quantities,
some thick and grosse, some thin and aeriall, and being hurl'd and roll'd
about with great and lesser curles, the Sun then and there being far
brighter, then with us here in <HI>England,</HI> caused such glorious colours to
rest upon those Clouds, as 'tis not possible to be believed, by him that
hath not seen it, nor can imagination frame so great a beauty: And the
reason is, the neernesse and propinquity of the place we are in, which
makes us see the glory of the Sun, and of those Stars too, which move
in that Horizon, much more perfectly, then at a further distance. The
proof of this I found, by looking on the Stars, that appear large and
bright to us in <HI>England,</HI> which being seen there, do not only lose much
of their light, but of their magnitude. For instance; There is little Star,
called <HI>Auriga,</HI> neer the <HI>Charles Wain,</HI> which in <HI>England</HI> I have seen very
perfectly, in bright nights; but at that distance, I could never see it in
the clearest night, though I have often attempted it. And upon my re∣turn
to <HI>England,</HI> I found it as I left it; which argues, that it was no de∣cay
or impediment in my sight, that made me lose it, but only the di∣stance
of place. I deny not, but a better sight then mine, may see this
Star <HI>Auriga</HI> at the <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> but then, so good a sight may see it more
perfectly in <HI>England</HI> than I can; and so the comparison holds. But ano∣ther
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>
reason, to prove the Celestiall Bodies brighter at neerer distance,
is, That the Moon being neer the Full, (at which time it gives a plen∣tifull
light) I have observed in the night, (the Sun having been set two
hours, or thereabouts) and at such a time, as the Clouds being in a fit
Position, to reflect the beams which the Moon then gives, to the place
where you are, you shall see a perfect Rain-bow in the night. But this
does not happen at all times, though there be Clouds, for the beams to
rest on; but only to such as are in an angle, where these beams reflect,
and meet in a just point.</P>
<P>Divers new Constellations we found, to the Southward, which in
our Horizon are never seen; and amongst them, one, which we call the
<HI>Cruser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> which is made up of foure Stars, which stand almost square, or
rather like the clawes of a Birds foot; and the Sea-men told us, that two
of them point at the South Pole, as the Painters of the <HI>Charles Wain,</HI> do
to the North Star. But the South Pole cannot be seen by us, that come
from the Northern parts, till we be under the Line, and then we see
both North and South; as we do the Sun in morning and evening, at six
and six. And thus much for Pleasure.</P>
<P>Now for Businesse, it was only this: To inform my selfe, the best I
could, of the account the Master and his Mates kept, of the Ships way,
both for Compasse, Card, and Logline, together with the observations
at noon, by that excellent and usefull Instrument, the Back-staffe, by
which we know to a mile, the Latitude we are in; and if we had an
Instrument, to finde out the Longitude as perfectly, every man might
guid a Ship, that could but keep an account.</P>
<P>To the knowledge of this great secret, of the Ships Course, divers
Gentlemen of our company applyed themselves very diligently; for the
Master was not froward, to communicate his skill to all that were of his
Messe. And to such a proficiency we were grown, as to lay a wager with
the Boat-swain, a very good Seaman, upon the first sight of the Iland
of <HI>Barbadoes.</HI> He laid, we should not see it till the afternoon, or late in the
evening. We, that we should make it before noon. Whether it were
chance, or our skilfulnesse, I know not, but we won the wager, which
was a couple of very fat Hens, which we caused to be drest, and eat
them in sight of the Iland, with a double joy: first, that we had won
the wager; next, that we were grown so neer our wished Harbour.</P>
<P>Being now come in sight of this happy Iland, the neerer we came,
the more beautifull it appeared to our eyes; for that being in it selfe ex∣treamly
beautifull, was best discern'd, and best judg'd of, when our eyes
became full Masters of the object. There we saw the high, large, and
lofty Trees, with their spreading Branches, and flourishing tops, seem'd
to be beholding to the earth and roots, that gave them such plenty of
sap for their nourishment, as to grow to that perfection of beauty and
largenesse. Whilst they, in gratitude, return their cool shade, to secure
and shelter them from the Suns heat, which, without it, would scorch
and drie away. So that bounty and goodnesse in the one, and grateful∣nesse
in the other, serve to make up this beauty, which otherwise would
lie empty &amp; waste. And truly these vegetatives, may teach both the sen∣sible
and reasonable Creatures, what it is that makes up wealth, beauty,
and all harmony in that <HI>Leviathan,</HI> a well governed Common-wealth:
Where the Mighty men, and Rulers of the earth, by their prudent and
carefull protection, secure them from harmes; whilst they retribute
<PB N="21" REF="18"/>
their paynes, and faithfull obedience, to serve them in all just Com∣mands.
And both these, interchangeably and mutually in love,
which is the Cord that bindes up all imperfect Harmonie. And where
these are wanting, the roots dry, and leaves fall away, and a generall
decay, and devastation ensues. Witnesse the woefull experience of
these sad times we live in.</P>
<P>Being now come to the distance of two or three leagues, my first
observation was, the forme of the Iland in generall, which is highest
in the middle; by which commodity of situation, the inhabitants
within, have these advantages; a free prospect to sea, and a reception
of pure refreshing ayer, and breezes that come from thence; the plan∣tations
overlooking one another so; as the most inland parts, are not
bard nor restrained the liberties of their view to sea, by those that
dwell between them and it. For as we past along neer the shoare,
the plantations appear'd to us one above another: like severall sto∣ries
in stately buildings, which afforded us a large proportion of de∣light.
So that we begg'd of the Master, to take down those of his
sayles, that gave the ship the greatest motion, that we might not be
depriv'd on a sudden, of a sight we all were so much pleased with
But our Cattle and Horses (who were under hatches; and therefore
no partners of this object▪) having devoured all their fodder, and
were now ready to come to that necessity, as the next thing to be
thought on, was to plane deale boards, and feed them with the sha∣vings;
Which deadly hunger, caused such lowing and bellowing of
the poor Cattle, as their cry stopped the Masters eares, so as the
smoothest, and most perswasive language, we could use: could not
force a passage, but with all the haste he could, put into <HI>Carlils Bay;</HI>
which is the best in the Iland, where we found riding at Anchor, 22
good ships, with boates playing two and fro, with Sayles and Oates,
which carried commodities from place to place: so quick stirring, and
numerous: as I have seen it below the bridge at <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Yet notwithstanding all this appearance of trade, the Inhabitants
of the Ilands, and shipping two were so grieviously visited with the
plague, (or as killing a disease,) that before a month was expired after
our Arivall, the living were hardly able to bury the dead. Whether it
were brought thither in shipping: (for in long voyages, diseases
grow at Sea, and takes away many passengers, and those diseases prove
contagious,) or by the distempers of the people of the Iland: who
by theill dyet they keep, and drinking strong waters, bring diseases
upon themselves, was not certainly known. But I have this rea∣son
to beleeve the latter: because for one woman that dyed, there
were tenne men; and the men were the greater deboystes.</P>
<P>In this sad time, we arriv'd in the Iland; and it was a doubt whether
this disease, or famine threatned most; There being a generall scar∣city
of Victuals throughout the whole Iland.</P>
<P>Our intention at first, was not to stay long there, but onely to sell
our goods, Cattle, and Horses; and so away to <HI>Antigoa;</HI> where we
intended to plant: but the ships being (for the most part) infected
with this disease, and our selves being unprovided of handes for a
new plantation (by reason of the miscarying of a ship, which set ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
before us from <HI>Plimouth,</HI> a month before, with men victuals, and all
utensell's fitted for a plantation, we were compelled to stay longer in the
<PB N="22" REF="19"/>
Iland than we attended. Besides, the ship we came in, was consign∣ed
to another part in <HI>Africa,</HI> called <HI>Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chew,</HI> to trade for <HI>Negroes.</HI></P>
<P>But during the time of our stay there, we made enquires of some
small plantation to rest us on, til the times became better, and fitter for
our remove; with intent to make use of those few hands we
had, to settle that, till we had supplies, and new directions from
<HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And so upon discourse with some of the most knowing men of
the Iland, we found that it was farre better, for a man that had money,
goods, or Credit, to purchase a plantation there ready furnisht, and
stockt with Servants, Slaves, Horses, Cattle, Assinigoes, Camels, &amp;c. with
a sugar worke, and an Ingenio: than to begin upon a place, where land
is to be had for nothing, but a triviall Rent, and to indure all hard∣ships,
and a tedious expectation, of what profit or pleasure may arise,
in many yeers patience: and that, not to be expected, without large
and frequent supplies from <HI>England;</HI> and yet fare, and labour hard. This
knowledge, was a spurre to set on Colonel <HI>Modiford,</HI> who had both
goods and credit, to make enquiry for such a purchase, which in ve∣ry
few dayes he lighted on; making a visit to the Governonr <HI>Mr.
Phillip Bell,</HI> met there with Major <HI>William Hilliard,</HI> an eminent plan∣ter
of the Iland, and a Councellor, who had been long there, and was
now desirous to sucke in some of the sweet ayre of <HI>England:</HI> And
glad to find a man likely to performe with him, took him home to
his house, and began to treate with him, for halfe the plantation upon
which he lived; which had in it 500 Acres of Land, with a faire dwel∣ling
house, an Ingenio plac't in a roome of 400 foot square; a boyling
house, filling roome, Cisterns, and Still-house; with a Carding house, of
100 foot long, and 40 foot broad; with stables, Smiths forge, and rooms
to lay provisions, of Corne, and Bonavist; Houses for <HI>Negroes</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI>
slaves, with 96 <HI>Negroes,</HI> and three <HI>Indian</HI> women, with their Children;
28 Christians, 45 Cattle for worke, 8 Milch Cowes, a dosen Horses
and Mares, 16 Assinigoes.</P>
<P>After a Months treaty, the bargaine was concluded, and Colonel
<HI>Modiford</HI> was to pay for the Moity of this plantation, 7000 l; to be pay∣ed,
1000 l in hand, the rest 2000 l. a time, at sixe and sixe months,
and Colonel <HI>Modiford</HI> to receive the profit of halfe the plantation
as it rose, keeping the account together, both of the expence and
profit.</P>
<P>In this plantation of 500 acres of land, there was imployed for sugar
somewhat more then 200 acres; above 80 acres for pasture, 120 for
wood, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 for Tobacco, 5 for Ginger, as many for Cotton wool, and 70
acres for provisions; <HI>viz.</HI> Corne, Potatoes, Plantines, Cassavie, and
Bonavist; some few acres of which for fruite; <HI>viz.</HI> Pines, Plantines,
Milions, Bonanoes, Gnavers Water Milions, Oranges; Limons, Limes, &amp;c.
most of these onely for the table.</P>
<P>Upon this plantation I lived with these two partners a while, But
with Colonel <HI>Modiford▪</HI> three years; for the other went for <HI>England,</HI>
and left Colonel <HI>Modiford</HI> to manage the imployment alone; and I to
give what assistance I could for the benefit of both: which I did, part∣ly
at their requests, and partly at the instance of Mr. <HI>Thomas Kendall,</HI>
who reposed much confidence in me, in case Colonel <HI>Modiford</HI> should
miscarry in the Voyage.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="19"/>
<P>I only speak thus much, that you may perceive, I had time enough
to improve my selfe, in the knowledge of the managment of a Plan∣tation
of this bulk; and therefore, you may give the more credit in
what I am to say, concerning the profit and value of this Plantation,
which I intend as a Scale, for those that go upon the like; or to varie
it to greater or lesse proportions, at their pleasure. And indeed, I
wanted no tutridge, in the learning this mystery; for, to do him right,
I hold Collonell <HI>Modiford</HI> as able, to undertake and perform such a
charge, as any I know. And therefore I might (according to my abi∣lity)
be able to say something, which I will, as briefly as I can, deliver
to you, in such plain language as I have.</P>
<P>But before I come to say any thing of the Iland, as it wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when I
arrived there, I will beg leave, to deliver you a word or two, what
hath been told me by the most ancient Planters, that we found there,
and what they had by tradition from their Predecessors. For, few or
none of them that first set foot there, were now living.</P>
<P>About the year a Ship of Sir <HI>William Curteens,</HI> returning
from <HI>Ternambock</HI> in <HI>Brasill,</HI> being driven by foul weather upon this
coast, chanc'd to fall upon this Iland, which is not far out of the way,
being the most windwardly Iland of all the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arribbies, (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>obago</HI> only ex∣cepted;)
and Anchoring before it, stayed some time, to informe
themselves of the nature of the place; which they found by tryalls in
severall parts, to be so overgrown with Wood, as there could be
found no Champions, or <HI>Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>annas</HI> for men to dwell in; nor found
they any beasts to inhabit there, only Hogs, and those in abundance:
the <HI>Portugalls</HI> having long before, put some ashoar for breed, in case
they should at any time be driven by foul weather, to be cast upon
the Iland, they might there finde fresh meat, to serve them upon such
an extremity: And the fruits and roots that grew there, afforded them
so great plenty of food, as they multiplyed abundantly. So that the
Natives of the leeward Ilands, that were at the distance of sight, com∣ming
thither in their <HI>Cannoas,</HI> and <HI>Periagos,</HI> and finding such Game to
hunt, as these hogs, and the flesh so sweet and excellent in tast, they
came often thither a hunting, and stayed sometimes a month toge∣ther,
and so returned again at pleasure, leaving behinde them certain
tokens of their being there, which were, Pots, of severall sizes, in
which they boyled their meat, made of clay, so finely tempered, and
turned with such art, as I have not seen any like them, for finenesse of
mettle, and curiosity of turning, in <HI>England.</HI> This information I re∣ceived
from the Planters in <HI>Barbadoes.</HI> But being here a Prisoner, in
the <HI>Upper Bench</HI> Prison, my chance was to meet with an antient Cap∣tain,
and one of those that first landed on the Iland; and had the ma∣naging
of a good part of the Iland, under <HI>William</HI> late Earle of <HI>Pem∣brok,</HI>
before my Lord of <HI>Carlile</HI> begg'd it of King <HI>James.</HI> This Captain
<HI>Canon</HI> (for so was his name) inform'd me for certain, that this was a
grosse mistake in the Planters, and that no Indians ever came there:
But those Pots were brought by the Negres, which they fetcht from
<HI>Angola,</HI> and some other parts of <HI>Africa;</HI> and that he had seen them
make of them at <HI>Angola,</HI> with the greatest art that may be. Though
I am willing to believe this Captain, who delivered upon his know∣ledge,
that the Negres brought some Pots thither, and very finely
and artificially made; yet, it does not hinder any man from believing,
<PB N="24" REF="20"/>
that the Indians brought some too; and who knowes, which were
the most exactly made. For, 'tis certain, that from some part of the
Iland, you may see (in a clear day) St. <HI>Vincents</HI> perfectly: And if we
can see them, why may not they see us; and they will certainly ven∣ture
to any place they see, so far as they know they can reach before
night, setting out very early in the morning. But I leave you to credit
which of these you please, either, or both.</P>
<P>But I have a great inclination to believe, the <HI>Indians</HI> have been
there, for this reason, that the Iland of St. <HI>Vincents,</HI> lying in the same
Climate with this of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arbado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> the Clay may be of the same nature
and qualitie; and they, having the skill to bring their Clay to so fine
a temp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, as to burn and not break, may shew us the way, to temper
ours of the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> so, as we may make Bricks to burn, without
chopping or cracking; which those of <HI>Angola,</HI> being far off, and it
may be, their Clay of different temper, cannot help us in. And it is no
hard matter, to procure an <HI>Indian</HI> or two, to come from that Iland, and
give us direction, which would be of infinite use and advantage, to
our buildings in <HI>Barbadoes.</HI> But this digression must not lead me out of
the way of my businesse.</P>
<P>This discovery being made, and advice given to their friends in
<HI>England,</HI> other Ships were sent, with men, provisions, and working
tooles, to cut down the Woods, and clear the ground, so as they might
plant provisions to keep them alive, which, till then, they found but
straglingly amongst the Woods. But having clear'd some part of it,
they planted <HI>Potatoes, Plat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nes,</HI> and <HI>Mayes,</HI> with some other fruites;
which, with the Hogs-flesh they found, serv'd only to keep life and
soul together. And their supplies from <HI>England</HI> comming so slow, and
so uncertainly, they were often driven to great extremities: And the
Tobacco that grew there, so earthy and worthlesse, as it could give
them little or no return from <HI>England,</HI> or else-where; so that for a
while they lingred on in a lamentable condition. For, the Woods
were so thick and most of the Trees so large and massie, as they were
not to be falne with so few hands; and when they were laid along,
the branches were so thick and boysterous, as required more help, and
those strong and active men, to lop and remove them off the ground.
At the time we came first there, we found both <HI>Potatoes, Maies,</HI> and
<HI>Bona<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s,</HI> planted between the boughes, the Trees lying along upon
the ground; so far short was the ground then of being clear'd. Yet,
we found <HI>Indico</HI> planted, and so well ordered, as it sold in <HI>London</HI> at
very good rates; and their Cotten wool, and Fustick wood, prov'd
very good and staple commodities. So that having these foure sorts
of goods to traffick with, some ships were invited (in hope of gain by
that trade) to come and visit them, bringing for exchange, such com∣modities
as they wanted, working Tools, Iron, Steel, Cloaths, Shirts,
and Drawers, Hose and Shoes, Hats, and more Hands. So that begin∣ning
to taste the sweet of this Trade, they se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> themselves hard to work,
and lived in much better condition.</P>
<P>But when the Canes, had been planted three or four years, they
found that to be the main Plant, to improve the value of the whole
Iland: And so, bent all their endeavours to advance their knowledge
in the planting, and making Sugar: Which knowledge, though they
studied hard, was long a learning. But I will forbear to say any thing
<PB N="25" REF="20"/>
of that, till I bring in the Plants; where you shall finde not only the
colour, shape, and qualitie of this Plant, but the worth and value of it,
together the whole processe of the great work of Sugar-making,
which is the thing I mainly aime at: But, in my way to that, I will give
you a sleight description or view, of the Iland in generall: and first, of
the Scituation,</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Scitua∣tion.</NOTE> It were a crime,not to believe, but that you are well verst in the
knowledge of all parts of the known habitable world; and I shall
seem impertinent; if I go about to inform you of the scituation of this
Iland. But, because there have been some disputes between Seamen,
whether it lie in bare 13 Degrees, or in 13 Degrees and 30 Minutes,
I shall easily be led by the most voices, of the most able Seamen, to
give for granted, that <HI>Carlile Bay,</HI> which is the Harbour where most of
them put in, is 13 Degrees and 30 Minutes from the Line, to the Nor∣thern
Latitude.</P>
<P>This Bay is, without exception, the best in the Iland, and is some∣what
more then a league over; and from the points of Land to the
bottom of the Bay, is twice as much.</P>
<P>Upon the most inward part of the Bay, stands the Town, which
is about the bignesse of <HI>Hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>slo,</HI> and is called the <HI>Bridge;</HI> for that a long
Bridge was made at first over a little nook of the Sea, which was ra∣ther
a Bog then Sea.</P>
<P>A Town ill scituate; for if they had considered health, as they did
conveniency, they would never have set it there; or, if they had any
intention at first, to have built a Town there, they could not have
been so improvident, as not to forsee the main inconveniences that
must ensue, by making choice of so unhealthy a place to live in. But,
one house being set up, another was erected, and so a third, and a
fourth, till at last it came to take the name of a Town; Divers Store-houses
being there built, to stow their goods in, for their conveni∣ence,
being neer the Harbour. But the main oversight was, to build
their Town upon so unwholsome a place. For, the ground being som∣what
lower within the Land, than the Sea-banks are, the spring-Tides
flow over, and there remains, making a great part of that flat,
a kinde of Bog or Morost, which vents out so loathsome a savour, as
cannot but breed ill blood, and is (no doubt) the occasion of much
sicknesse to those that live there.</P>
<P>At the time of our arrivall, and a month or two after, the sicknesse
raign'd so extreamly, as the living could hardly bury the dead; and for
that this place was neer to them, they threw the dead carcases into
the bog, which infected so the water, as divers that drunk of it were
absolutely poysoned, and dyed in few houres after; but others,
taking warning by their harmes, forbare to taste any more of it.</P>
<P>The ground on either side the Bay, (but chiefly that to the East∣ward)
is much firmer, and lies higher; and, I believe, they will in
time, remove the Town upon that ground, for their habitations,
though they suffer the Store-houses to remain where they are, for their
convenience. But the other scituation, may be made with some
charge as convenient as that, and abundantly more healthfull.</P>
<P>Three Bayes there are more of note in this Iland; one, to the East∣ward
of this, which they call <HI>Austin's Bay,</HI> not in commemoration of
any Saint, but of a wilde mad drunken fellow, whose lewd and ex∣travagant
<PB N="26" REF="21"/>
carriage, made him infamous in the Iland; and his Plantati∣on
standing neer this Bay, it was called by his name. The other two
are to the West of <HI>Carlile Bay;</HI> and the first is called <HI>Mackfields Bay,</HI> the
other <HI>Spikes Bay;</HI> but neither of these three are environ'd with Land, as
<HI>Carlile Bay</HI> is: but being to the Leeward of the Iland, and good An∣chorage,
they seldome are in danger; unlesse in the time of <HI>Turnado,</HI>
when the wind turnes about to the South; and then, if they be not
well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oor'd, they are subject to fall foul on one another, and some∣times
driven aground. For, the Leeward part of the Iland being ra∣ther
shelvie then rockie, they seldome or never are cast away.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Extent.</NOTE> The length and breadth of this Iland,I must deliver you only upon
trust; for, I could not go my selfe about it, being full of other businesse,
but I had some speech with the antientest, and most knowing Sur∣veyer
there, one Captain <HI>Swann,</HI> who told me, that he once took an
exact plot of the whole Iland, but it was commanded out of his hands
by the then Governour, Sir <HI>Henry Hunks,</HI> who carried it into <HI>England▪</HI>
since which time, neither himselfe, nor any other, to his knowledge,
had taken any; nor did he believe, there was any extant. I desired him
yet that he would rub up his memory, and take a little paines in the
survey of his Papers, to try what could be found out there, that might
give me some light in the extent of the Iland, which he promised to
do; and within a while after, told me, that he had found by some
Papers, that lay scattered in his Study, the length of it; but for the
breadth, it was very uncertain, by reason of the nooks and corners
that reach'd out into the Sea, so that it must of necessity be broad in
some places, and narrow in others. I desired then to know, how ma∣ny
miles the broadest, and how few the narrowest parts might be. He
told me, that he guest, the broadest place could not be above seven∣teen
miles, nor the narrowest under twelve; and that the length, he
was assured, was twenty eight miles. Out of these uncertain grounds,
it was a hard matter to conclude upon any certainties; and therefore
the evenest way I can go, is, upon a <HI>Medium,</HI> between twelve and se∣venteen;
and, I will be as modest as I can in my computation; and
take but 14. which is lesse then the <HI>Medium,</HI> and multiply 14. which
is supposed to be the breadth, by 28. which is assured to be the length,
and they make 392 square miles in the Iland. Beyond this, my enqui∣ries
could not reach, and therefore was compell'd to make my esti∣mate
upon this bare Supposition. But, for the forme of the <HI>Superficies</HI>
of the Iland, I am utterly ignorant; and for the Upright, I have
given it you in my first view of the Iland, that it rises highest in the
middle.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tempera∣ture of the ayre.</NOTE> Eight months of the year,the weather is very hot, yet not so scalding,
but that servants, both Christians, and slaves, labour and travell tenne
hours in a day.</P>
<P>As the Sunne rises, there rise with him coole breezes of wind, and
the higher and hotter the sunne shines, the stronger and cooler the
breezes are, and blow alwaies from the Nore East, and by East,
except in the time of the <HI>Turnado:</HI> And then it sometimes chops about
into the South, for an hour or two, and then returnes againe to the
same poynt where it was. The other foure months it is not so hot,
but is neer the temper of the aire in England, in the middle of May,
and though in the hot seasons we sweat much, yet we doe not finde
that faintnesse, that we finde here, in the end of July, or beginning of
August. With this great heat, there is such a moysture, as must of ne∣cessity
cause the ayer to be very unwholsome.</P>
<P>We are seldome drye or thirsty, unlesse we overheat our bodyes
with extraordinary labour, or drinking strong drinks; as of our Eng∣lish
spirits, which we carry over, of french Brandy, or the drinke of
the Iland, which is made of the skimmings of the Coppers, that boyle
the Sugar, which they call kill-Divell. And though some of these be
needfull if they be used with temper; yet the immoderate use of them,
over-heats the body, which causes Costivenesse, and Tortions in the
bowels; which is a disease very frequent there; and hardly cur'd, and
of which many have dyed, but certainely, strong drinks are very
requisit, where so much heat is; for the spirits being exhausted with
much sweating, the inner parts are left cold and faint, and shall need
comforting, and reviving. Besides, our bodyes having bin used to
colder Clymates, finde a debility, and a great fayling in the vigour,
and sprightliness we have in colder Climats; our blood too, is thin∣ner
and paler than in our own Countreys. Nor is the meat so well
relisht as in England; but flat and insipid, the hogges flesh onely ex∣cepted,
which is indeed the best of that kinde that I thinke is in the
world.</P>
<P>Our Horses and Cattle seldome drinke, and when they do, it is in very
small quantities; except such as have their bodies over heated with
working.</P>
<P>This moysture of the ayre, causes all our knives, etweese, keyes,
needles, swords, and ammunition, to rust; and that in an instant
for take your knife to the grindstone, and grind away all the rust;
which done, wipe it dry, and put it up into your sheath, and so into
your pocket, and in a very little time, draw it out; and you shall find
it beginning to rust all over; which in more time, will eate deep into
the steele, and spoyle the blade. Our locks too, that are not often
made use of, will rust in the wards, and so become uselesse, and Clocks,
and Watches will seldome or never go true; and all this occasion'd
by the moystnesse of the Ayre. And this we found at fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: for before
we came neere this Iland, we perceiv'd a kind of weather, which is
neither raine nor mist, and continued with us sometimes four or five
dayes together, which the seamen call a Heysey weather, and rises to
such a height, as though the sunne shine out bright, yet we cannot see
his body, till nine a clock in the morning, nor after three in the after∣noone.
And we see the skie over our heads cleare: a close and very
unhealthull weather, and no pleasure at all in it.</P>
<PB N="28" REF="22"/>
<P>This great heat and moysture together, is certainely the occasion
that the trees and plants grow to such vast height, and largenesse as
they are.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">How wate∣red.</NOTE> There is nothing in this Iland so much wanting, as Springs and Ri∣vers
of water; there being but very few, and those very smal &amp; incon∣siderable.
I know but only one River, and that may rather be term'd
a Lake, then a River; The Springs that runne into it, are never able to
fill it, they are so small; outfall to Sea it has none; but at spring tides,
the Sea comes in and fills it; and at Nepe tides, it cannot runne out
againe, the sea-banks being higher than it. But some of it issues out
through the Sands, and leaves behind it a mixt water, of fresh and
salt: at the time the tide comes in, it brings with it some fishes, which
are content to remaine there; being better pleased to live in this mixt
water, then in the Salt. Colonel <HI>Humphrey Walrond,</HI> who is owner of
the land of both sides, and therefore of it; has told me, that he has
taken fishes there, as bigge as Salmons, which have been overgrown
with fat, as you have seen Porpisces; but extreamely sweet and
firme.</P>
<P>But it has not been often, that such fish, or any other, have bin
taken in that place, by reason the whole Lake is filled with trees and
roots.</P>
<P>So that no Net can be drawn, nor any Hook laid; for they will wind
the lines about the roots, and so get away; or the lines break in pulling
up, being fastned to the roots.</P>
<P>This River, or Lake, reaches not within the Land above twelve score
yards, or a flight shot at most; and there is no part of it so broad, but
you may cast a Coyte over it.</P>
<P>The spring tides there, seldome rise above four or five foot up∣right:
there come from the sea into these small bibling rivolets, little
Lobsters, but wanting the great clawes afore, which are the sweetest
and fullest of fish, that I have seen; <HI>Chicester</HI> Lobsters are not to be com∣pared
to them.</P>
<P>But the water which the people of this Iland most relye upon, is
raine water; which they keep in ponds, that have descents of ground
to them, so that what falls on other ground, may runne thither. And
the place in which the Pond is set, must be low, and claye in the bot∣tome:
or if it be not naturally of Clay, it must be made so. For if it
finde any Leake to the rocky part, it gets between those clifts, and
sinks in an instant. About the end of <HI>December,</HI> these ponds are fill'd;
and with the help it hath by the weekly showrs that fall, they continue
so, yet sometimes they feele a want. This pond water, they use upon
all occasions, and to all purposes; to boyle their meat, to make their
drink, to wash their linnen, for it will beare soape. But one thing
seem'd to me a little loathsome, and that was the <HI>Negroes</HI> washing
themselves in the Ponds, in hot weather; whose bodies have none of
the sweetest savours. But the planters are pleased to say, that the
Sunne with his virtuall heat, drawes up all noysome vapours, and so
the waters become rarified, and pure againe. But it was a great sa∣tisfaction
to me, that a little Rivulet was neere us, from whence
we fetcht dayly, as much as served us, both for meat, and drink.</P>
<P>In these ponds, I have never seen any small fish, fry, or any thing that
lives or moves in it, except some flies that fall into it; but the wa∣ter
<PB N="29" REF="22"/>
is clear and well tasted. And because their Cattle shall not be
in danger of miring or drowning, the best Husbands raile in a part of
the Pond, where it is of a competent depth, for the water to stand,
and pave that in the bottom with stone; and so the Cattle neither
raise the mud, nor sink in with their feet; and so the water comes
clear to them.</P>
<P>Water they save likewise from their houses, by gutters at the eves,
which carrie it down to cisterns. And the water which is kept there,
being within the limits of their houses, many of which are built in
manner of Fortifications, and have Lines, Bulwarks, and Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tians
to defend themselves, in case there should be any uproar or commo∣tion
in the Iland, either by the Christian servants, or Negre slaves;
serves them for drink whilst they are besieged; as also, to throw
down upon the naked bodies of the Negres, scalding hot; which is as
good a defence against their underminings, as any other weapons.</P>
<P>If any tumult or disorder be in the Iland, the next neighbour to it,
discharges a Musket, which gives the Alarum to the whole Iland; for,
upon the report of that, the next shoots, and so the next, and next, till
it go through the Iland: Upon which warning, they make ready.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meat and Drink for supportati∣on of life.</NOTE> Bread, which is accounted the staffe, or main supporter of mans
life, has not here that full taste it has in <HI>England;</HI> but yet they account
it nourishing and strengthening. It is made of the root of a small tree
or shrub, which they call <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>assavie;</HI> the manner of his grouth I will let
alone, till I come to speak of Trees and Plants in generall.</P>
<P>His root only, which we are now to consider, (because our bread is
made of it) is large and round, like the body of a small Still or retort;
and as we gather it, we cut sticks that grow neerest to it, of the same
tree, which we put into the ground, and they grow. And as we ga∣ther,
we plant. This root, before it come to be eaten, suffers a strange
conversion; for, being an absolute poyson when 'tis gathered, by good
ordering, comes to be wholsome and nourishing; and the manner of
doing it, is this: They wash the outside of the root clean, and lean it
against a Wheel, whose sole is about a foot broad, and covered with
Latine, made rough like a large Grater. The Wheel to be turned a∣bout
with a foot, as a Cutler turnes his Wheel. And as it grates the
root, it falls down in a large Trough, which is the receiver appointed
for that purpose. This root thus grated, is as rank poyson, as can be
made by the art of an Apothecary, of the most venomous simples he
can put together: but being put into a strong piece of double Canvas,
or Sackcloth, and prest hard, that all the juice be squeezed out, and
then opened upon a cloath, and dried in the Sun, 'tis ready to make
bread. And thus 'tis done.</P>
<P>They have a piece of Iron, which I guesse is cast round, the dia∣meter
of which, is about twenty inches, a little hollowed in the mid∣dle,
not unlike the mould that the Spectacle makers grinde their
glasses on, but not so much concave as that; about halfe an inch thick
at the brim or verge, but thicker towards the middle, with three feet
like a pot, about six inches high, that fire may be underneath. To
such a temper they heat this Pone, (as they call it) as to bake, but
not burn. When 'tis made thus hot, the <HI>Indians,</HI> whom we trust to
make it, because they are best acquainted with it, cast the meal upon
the Pone, the whole breadth of it, and put it down with their hands,
<PB N="30" REF="23"/>
and it will presently stick together: And when they think that side al∣most
enough, with a thing like a Battle-dore, they turn the other; and
so turn and re-turn it so often, till it be enough, which is presently
done. So they lay this Cake upon a flat board, and make another, and
so another, till they have made enough for the whole Family. This
bread they made, when we came first there, as thick as a pancake; but
after that, they grew to a higher degree of curiosity, and made it as
thin as a wafer, and yet purely white and crispe, as a new made wa∣fer.
Salt they never use in it, which I wonder at; for the bread being
tastlesse of it selfe, they should give it some little seasoning. There
is no way it eats so well, as in milk, and there it tasts like Almonds.
They offer to make Pie-crust, but very few attain to the skill of that;
for, as you work it up with your hand, or roll it out with a roller, it
will alwaies crackle and chop, so that it will not be raised to hold any
liquor, neither with, nor without, butter or eggs.</P>
<P>But after many tryalls, and as often failings, at last, I learnt the se∣cret
of an <HI>Indian</HI> woman, who shew'd me the right way of it, and that
was, by searsing it very fine, (and it will fall out as fine, as the finest
wheat-flower in <HI>England</HI>) if not finer. Yet, this is not all the secret,
for all this will not cure the cracking. But this is the main skill of the
businesse: Set water on the fire in a skillet, and put to it as much of
this fine flower, as will temper it to the thicknesse of starch or pap;
and let it boyl a little, keeping it stirring with a slice; and mix this
with the masse of flower you mean to make into pye-crust, which
being very well mingled, and wrought together, you may add what
cost you will of butter and eggs, and it will rise and stand nere as well
as our past in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But those that have not Cows, &amp; cannot make butter upon the place,
but must make use of such as is brought from <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> were
better leave it out, &amp; be content to eat their pie-crust drie. Yet I make
a main difference, between butter that is brought from either of those
places, in respect of the times it is brought. For, if a ship set out from
<HI>England</HI> in <HI>November,</HI> and that ship arive at the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> at the middle,
or neer the end of <HI>December,</HI> when the Sun is at the farthest distance,
the butter may come thither in very good condition; and being set in
cool places, may retain the taste for a while: But, if the ship set out in
Spring or Summer, that brings this butter, it is not then to be endu∣red,
it is so restie and loathsome. Nor can Cheese be brought from
thence without spoyle, at that time of the year, except you put it in
oyle. Neither are Candles to be brought, for the whole barrell will
stick together in one lump, and stinck so profoundly, as neither Rats
nor mice will come neer them, much lesse eat of them. For which
reason, the Planters, who are much troubled with this annoyance,
as also, for that these candles cannot be taken out of the barrell whole,
nor will stand in the candlestick without drooping, and hanging
down; they burn for the most part wax lights, which they make
themselves, of wax they fetch from <HI>Africa,</HI> and have it at a reasonable
rate, there being no Bees in the <HI>Barbadoes.</HI></P>
<P>But I am too apt to flie out in extravagant digressions; for, the
thing I went to speak of, was bread only, and the severall kinds of it;
and having said as much of the bread of <HI>Cassavie</HI> as I know, I will
give you one word of another kinde of bread they make, which is a
<PB N="31" REF="23"/>
mixt sort of bread, and is made of the flower of <HI>Mayes</HI> and <HI>Cassavie</HI>
mixt together; for the <HI>Maies</HI> it selfe will make no bread, it is so ex∣tream
heavy and lumpish: But these two being mixt, they make it
into large Cakes, two inches thick; and that, in my opinion, tasts the
likest to English bread of any.</P>
<P>But the Negres use the <HI>Mayes</HI> another way, which is, toasting the
ears of it at the fire, and so eating it warm off the eare. And we have
a way, to feed our Christian servants with this <HI>Maies,</HI> which is, by
pounding it in a large Morter, and boyling it in water, to the thick∣nesse
of Frumentie; and so put in a Tray such a quantity, as wil serve
a messe of seven or eight people; give it them cold, and scarce afford
them salt with it. This we call <HI>Lob-lollie.</HI> But the Negres, when they
come to be fed with this, are much discontented, and crie out, <HI>O! O!
no more Lob-lob.</HI></P>
<P>The third sort of bread we use, is only Potatoes, which are cho∣sen
out of the dryest and largest they can chose: And at the time we
first came, there was little else used, at many good Planters Tables in
the Iland. And these are all the sorts of bread that I know growing
upon the place.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Drink of <HI>Mobbie.</HI></NOTE>The next thing that comes in order, is Drink, which being made
of severall materialls, afford more variety in the description. The
first, and that which is most used in the Iland, is <HI>Mobbie,</HI> a drink made
of Potatoes, and thus done. Put the Potatoes into a tub of water, and,
with a broom, stir them up and down, till they are washt clean; then
take them out, and put them into a large iron or brasse pot, such as
you boyl beefe in, in <HI>England;</HI> and put to them as much water, as will
only cover a quarter part of them; and cover the top of the pot with
a piece of thick canvas doubled, or such cloth as sacks are made with,
covering it close, that the steam go not out. Then make a little fire
underneath, so much only as will cause these roots to stew; and when
they are soft, take them out, and with your hands, squeeze, break, and
mash them very small, in fair water; letting them stay there, till the
water has drawn and suckt out all the spirit of the roots, which will
be done in an houre or two. Then put the liquor and roots into a
large wollen bag, like a jelly-bag, poynted at the bottom; and let it
run through that, into a Jar, and within two hours it will begin to
work. Cover it, and let it stand till the next day, and then 'tis fit to
be drunk. And as you will have it stronger or smaller, put in greater
or lesser quantities of roots; some make it so strong, as to be drunk
with small quantities But the drink it selfe, being temperately made,
does not at all flie up into the head, but is a sprightly thirst-quenching
drink. If it be put up in small casks, as Rundlets, or Firkins, it will last
foure or five daies good, and drink much more sprightly then out of
the Jar. I cannot liken it to any thing so neer, as <HI>Rhenish-wine</HI> in the
Must; but it is short of it in the strength of the spirit, and finenesse of
the tast.</P>
<P>There are two severall layers, in which these roots grow; one
makes the skins of the Potatoes white, the other red: And where the
red roots grow, the <HI>Mobbie</HI> will be red like <HI>Claret-wine;</HI> the other
white.</P>
<P>Though this be the drink most generally used in the Iland, yet I
cannot commend the wholsomnesse of it▪ for, the most part of the
<PB N="32" REF="24"/>
roots have a moyst quality in them, and are the cause of Hydropicke
humours. Mr. <HI>Phillip Bell,</HI> then the Governour of the Iland told me
that when he was Governour of the Ile of <HI>Providence,</HI> that there chan∣c'd
some Spaniards to land there, and tast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng of this drinke, wondred
that any of those that continually drinke it were alive; so unwholsome
and Hydropicke he conceived this drinke to be.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Perino.</NOTE> Another drinke they have which is accounted much wholesomer,
though not altogether so pleasant, and that is <HI>Perino;</HI>a drink which
the Indians make for their own drinking, and is made of the <HI>Cassavy</HI>
root, which I told you is a strong poyson; and this they cause their
old wives, who have a small remainder of teeth to chaw and spit out
into water, (for the better breaking and macerating of the root). This
juyce in three or four hours will worke, and purge it selfe of the poy∣sonous
quality.</P>
<P>Having shewed, you in the making of Bread, that the moysture be∣ing
prest out, which is accounted the poysonous quality that root has,
by drying and baking, it is made usefull and wholsome, and now
having the juyce and root both used, and both these put into water,
which is moyst, I know not which way to reconcile these direct con∣traryes,
but this; that the poyson of the old womens breath and teeth
having been tainted with many severall poxes, (a disease common
amongst them, though they have many and the best cures for it,) are
such opposites to the poyson of the <HI>Cassavie,</HI> as they bend their forces
so vehemently one against another, as they both spend their poysonous
qualities in that conflict; and so the relict of them both, becomes lesse
unwholsome; and the water, which is in it selfe pure, casts out the re∣mainder
of the ill qualities they leave behind: which is manifested by
the extraordinary working, which is farre beyond that of Beere, Wine,
or Sider with us in <HI>Europe.</HI> This drink will keep a month or two, being
put into barrels, and tasts the likest to English beere of any drink
we have there.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grippo.</NOTE> <HI>Grippo</HI> is a third sort of drinke, but few make it well; it was never my
chance to taste it, which made me the lesse curious to enquire after
it.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Punch.</NOTE> <HI>Punch</HI> is a fourth sort, &amp; of that I have drunke; it is made of water &amp;
sugar put together, which in tenne dayes standing will be very strong,
and fit for labourers.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plum-drinke.</NOTE> A fifth, is made of wilde Plumbs, which grow here in great abun∣dance,
upon very large trees, which being prest, and strayned, give a
very sharpe, and pognant flaver; but there is not much of it made,
because of the trouble of making it, and they are not there very indul∣gent
to their palats.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plantine-drinke.</NOTE> But the drinke of the Plantine, is farre beyond all these; gathering
them full ripe, and in the height of their sweetnesse, we pill off the
skin, and mash them in water well boyl'd; and after we have let them

it; and it is very strong and pleasant drinke, but it is to be drunk spa∣ringly,
for it is much stronger then Sack, and is apt to mount up into

<P>The seaventh sort of drink is that we make of the skimming of su∣gar,
which is infinitely strong, but not very pleasant in taste; it is com∣mon,
and therefore the lesse esteem'd; the value of it is halfe a Crown

layes them asleep on the ground, and that is accounted a very unwhol∣some

<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wine of Pines.</NOTE> The last and best sort of drinke that this Iland or the world af∣fords, 
is the incomparable wine of Pines; And is certainly the Nectar
which the Gods drunke; for on earth there is none like it; and that is
made of the pure juyce of the fruit it selfe, without commixture of
water, or any other creature, having in it selfe, a naturall compound
of all tastes excellent, that the world can yield. This drink is too
pure to keep long; in three or four dayes it will be fine; 'tis made
by pressing the fruite and strayning the liquor, and it is kept in bot∣tles.</P>
<P>Having given you a taste of the Bread, and Drinke this Iland
affords, which will serve any mans palate, that is not over curious; I
could tell you what we have of both sorts that is brought to us from
other parts of the world; as Biskets, both fine and coorse, Barrels of
meale close put up; which comes to us very sweet from <HI>England,</HI> and
<HI>Holland;</HI> of which we make Bread, Pye-crust, and Puddings. And for
drink good English Beer, French and Spanish Wines, with others, some
from the <HI>Maderas,</HI> some from <HI>Fiall,</HI> one of the Ilands of <HI>Asores;</HI> So we
cannot justly complaine of want, either of bread or drink, and, from
England, spirits, some of Anniseeds, some of Mint, some of Wormwood,
&amp;c. And from <HI>France, Brandy,</HI> which is extreame strong, but accoun∣ted
very wholsome.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meat of all kinds.</NOTE> Having given you a just account, as neere as my memory will serve
of the bread and drinke of this Iland: The next thing is the severall
sortes of meat we have there; and because Hogges flesh is the most
generall meat, and indeed the best the Iland affords, I will begin with
that, which is (without question) as good, as any can be of that kind:
for their feeding being as good, as can grow any where, the flesh must
needs be answerable; fruit, the nuts of Locust, Pompians of a rare kind,
almost as sweet as Milions, the bodies of the Plantines, and Bonanoes,
Sugar-canes, and Mayes, being their dayly food.</P>
<P>When we came first upon the Iland, I perceiv'd the sties they made
to hold them, were trees, with the ends lying crosse upon one another,
and the inclosure they made, was not large enough to hold the
numbers of Hogges were in them, with convenient distance to play
and stirre themselves for their health, and pleasure; so that they were
in a manner pesterd, and choakt up, with their own stinke, which is
sure the most noysome of any other beast, and by reason of the Suns
heat much worse; I have smelt the stinke of one of those sties downe
the wind, neer a mile, through all the wood: and the crouding and
thrusting them so close together, was certainly the cause of their want
of health, which much hindred their growth; So that they were nei∣ther
so large, nor their flesh so sweet, as when they were wild, and at
their own liberty, and choyce of feeding.</P>
<P>For I have heard Major <HI>Hilliard</HI> say: that at their first comming
there, they found Hogges, that one of them weighed (the intrals be∣ing
taken out, and the head off) 400 weight. And now at the time of

my being there, the most sort of those, that were in ours and our
neighbours styes, were hardly so big as the ordinary swine in <HI>England.</HI>
So finding this decay in their grouth, by stowing them too close to∣gether,
I advised Collonell <HI>Modiford</HI> to make a larger stye, and to wall
it about with stone; which he did, and made it a mile about, so that
it was rather a Park than a Stye; and set it on the side of a drie Hill,
the greatest part Rock, with a competent Pond of water in the bot∣tom;
and plac'd it between his two Plantations, that from either,
food might be brought, and cast over to them, with great conveni∣ence:
And made several divisions in the Park, for the Sowes with Pigg,
with little houses standing shelving, that their foulnesse by gutters
might fall away, and they lie drie; Other divisions for the Barrow-Hoggs,
and some for Boars.</P>
<P>This good ordering caused them to grow so large and fat, as they
wanted very little of their largnesse when they were wilde. They are
the sweetest flesh of that kinde, that ever I tasted, and the lovliest to
look on in a dish, either boyl'd, roasted, or bak'd: With a little help of
art. I will deceive a very good palate, with a shoulder of it for Mut∣ton,
or a leg for Veal, taking off the skin, with which they were wont
to make minc't Pies, seasoning it with salt, cloves, and mace, and
some sweet herbs minc't. And being bak'd, and taken out of the
Oven, opening the lid, put in a dramme-cup of <HI>kill-devill;</HI> and being
stirr'd together, set it on the Table; and that they call'd a <HI>Calvesfoot
pie;</HI> and, till I knew what it was made of, I thought it very good
meat. When I came first upon the Iland, I found the Pork drest the
plain waies of boyling, roasting, and sometimes baking: But I gave
them some tastes of my Cookery, in hashing, and fricaseing this flesh;
and they all were much taken with it; and in a week, every one was
practising the art of Cookery. And indeed, no flesh tasts so well in
Collops, Hashes, or Fricases, as this. And when I bak't it, I alwaies
laid a Side of a young Goat underneath, and a side of a Shot (which
is a young Hog of a quarter old) a top. And this, well seasoned, and
well bak'd, is as good meat, as the best Pasty of Fallow-Deer, that
ever I tasted.</P>
<P>In the coolest time of the year, I have made an essay to powder it,
and hang it up for Bacon: But there is such losse in't, as 'tis very ill
husbandry to practise it; for, it must be cut through in so many places,
to let the salt in, as when 'tis to be drest, much goes to waste. And
therefore I made no more attempts that way. But a little corning
with salt, makes this flesh very savoury, either boyled or roasted.</P>
<P>About <HI>Christmas,</HI> we kill a Boar, and of the sides of it, make three
or four collers of Brawne; for then the weather is so cool, as, with some
art, it may be kept sweet a week: and to make the souc't drink give it
the speedier and quicker seasoning, we make it of <HI>Mobbie,</HI> with store
of Salt, Limons, and Lymes, sliced in it, with some Nutmeg, which
gives it an excellent flaver.</P>
<P>Beef, we have very seldome any, that feeds upon the soyle of this
place, except it be of Gods killing, (as they tearme it); for very few
are kill'd there by mens hands; it were too ill husbandry, for they cost
too dear, and they cannot be spared from their work, which they
must advance by all the means they can. Such a Planter as Collonell
<HI>James Drax</HI> (who lives like a Prince) may kill now and then one;
<PB N="35" REF="25"/>
but very few in the Iland did so when I was there.</P>
<P>The next to Swines-flesh in goodnesse, are Turkies, large, fat, and
full of gravie. Next to them, Pullen or Donghill-foule▪ and last of all,
Muscovia-Ducks, which being larded with the fat of this Porke, (be∣ing
seasoned with pepper and salt) are an excellent bak'd-meat. All
these, with their Eggs and Chickens, we eat.</P>
<P>Turtle-Doves the have of two sorts, and both very good meat;
but there is a sort of Pidgeons, which come from the leeward Ilands
at one time of the year, and it is in <HI>September;</HI> and stay till <HI>Christmas</HI> be
past, and then return again: But very many of them nere make re∣turnes,
to tell newes of the good fruit they found there: For, they are
so fat, and of such excellent tastes, as many foulers kill them with
guns, upon the trees; and some of them are so fat, as their weight with
the fall, causes them to burst in pieces. They are good roasted, boylld,
or bak'd, but best cut in halves, and stewed; to which Cookery, there
needs no liquor, for their own gravie will abundantly serve to stew
them.</P>
<P>Rabbets we have, but tame ones, and they have but faint tastes,
more like a Chicken then a Rabbet.</P>
<P>And though they have divers other Birds, which I will not forget
to recount in their due times, and place; yet, none for food for the
Table, which is the businesse I tend at this present. Other flesh-meat,
I do not remember.</P>
<P>Now for fish, though the Iland stands as all Ilands do, invironed
with the Sea, (and therefore is not like to be unfurnish't of that pro∣vision)
yet, the Planters are so good husbands, and tend their profits
so much, as they will not spare a Negres absence so long, as to go to
the <HI>Bridge</HI> and fetch it. And the Fishermen seeing their fish lie upon
their hands, and stink, (which it will do in lesse then six hours) for∣bear
to go to Sea to take it; only so much as they can have present
vent for, at the Taverns at the <HI>Bridge;</HI> and thither the Planters come,
when they have a minde to feast themselves with fish, to Mr. <HI>Jobsons,</HI>
or <HI>Joan Fullers,</HI> where they have it well drest; for they were both my
Pupills. Butter they seldome have, that will beat thick; but in stead
of that, we are fain to use vinegar and spice, and much of it fryed in
oyle, and eaten hot; and some marinated, and souc't in pickle, and
eaten cold. Collonell <HI>Humphrey Walrond</HI> has the advantage of all the
Planters in the Iland, for, having a Plantation neer the Sea, he hath of
his own a Sain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to catch fish withall, which his own servants and
slaves put out to Sea, and, twice or thrice a week, bring home all sorts
of such small and great fishes, as are neer the shoar; amongst which,
some are very large, and excellently well tasted. For, he being a Gentle∣man,
that had been bred with much freedome, liberty, and plenty, in
<HI>England,</HI> could not set his mind so earnestly upon his profit, as to
forget his accustomed lawfull pleasures, but would have his Table
well furnish'd, with all sorts of good meat the Land and Sea afforded;
and as freely bid his friends welcome to it. And I, as the poorest of
his friends, in a lingring sicknesse, and neer death, found such a cha∣rity
with him, as I shall never forget to pay my thanks for, to the
last hour of my life; and I shall account it as a a great happinesse, (if
ever it fall in the compasse of my power) to be servicable to him or
his, as any thing that can befall me in the world.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="26"/>
<P>Amongst other fishes that were taken by his Saine, (as the Snap∣pers,
red and grey, Cavallos, Maquerells, Mullets, Cony-fish, with
divers others, firme and excellent sweet fish) he took four, that were
about a yard long at the least, all at one draught, and, to that length,
bigger grown then Salmonds, of the rarest colour that ever I beheld;
from the back-finne, which is the middle of the fish, to the end of the
tail, the purest grasse-green that ever I saw, and as shining as Satine:
but the finns and tai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dapled or spotted with as pure a hair-colour,
and from the back-finn to the head, pure hair colour-dapled with
green; the scales as big for the most part, as a halfe-crown piece of
silver. This fish is no fish of prey, but lives by what he finds in the bot∣tom
of the Sea, as I perceived by what was in his maw. An excellent
sweet fish; I dressed them severall waies, and all proved excellent.
There is one fish wanting to this Iland, whose kindes are very fre∣quent
upon most of the <HI>Charibby</HI> and <HI>Lucaick</HI>-Ilands; and that is the
green <HI>Turtle,</HI> which is the best food the Sea affords, and the greatest
store of them; but I have seen very few of that kind in the <HI>Barbadoes,</HI>
and those neither fat nor kindly; and the reason is, there are no
shelves nor sands to lay their eggs, or to ayre themselves on: For,
these fishes delight to be on the sands, and can remain there twelve
hours, all the time the Tyde is out; and then suffer themselves to be
carried away by the return of the next Tide. They take infinite
numbers of them, by turning them on their backs with staves, where
they lie till they are fetcht away. A large <HI>Turtle</HI> will have in her bo∣die
halfe a bushell of eggs, which she laies in the sand, and that being
warm, they are hatcht in the heat.</P>
<P>When you are to kill one of these fishes, the manner is, to lay him
on his back on a table, and when he sees you come with a knife in
your hand to kill him, he vapours out the grievousest sighes, that ever
you heard any creature make, and sheds as large tears as a Stag, that
has a far greater body, and larger eyes. He has a joynt or crevis, about
an inch within the utmost edge of his shell, which goes round about
his body, from his head to his tail, on his belly-side; into which joynt
or crevis, you put your knife, beginning at the hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and so rip up
that side, and then do as much to the other; then lifting up his belly,
which we call his <HI>Calipee,</HI> we lay open all his bowells, and taking them
out, come next to his heart, which has three distinct poynts, but all
meet above where the fat is; and if you take it out, and lay it in a dish,
it will stir and pant ten hours after the fish is dead. Sure, there is no
creature on the Earth, nor in the Seas, that enjoyes life with so much
sweetnesse and delight, as this poor fish the <HI>Turtle;</HI> nor none more de∣licate
in taste, and more nourishing, then he.</P>
<P>Next to the flesh and fish this Iland affords, 'tis fit to consider what
<HI>Quelquechoses</HI> there are to be found, that may serve to furnish out a
Table of such Viands, as are there to be had; which are eggs severall
waies, <HI>viz</HI> pocht, and laid upon sippits of bread, soakt in butter and
juice of limes, and sugar, with plumpt currens strewed upon them,
and cloves, mace, and cinamon beaten, strewed on that, with a little
salt. Eggs boyl'd and roasted, fryed with Collops, of the fat of Pork
well powdered. Buttered eggs, an Amulet of eggs, with the juice of
Limes and sugar, a Froize, and a Tansey; Custards, as good as any at
my Lord Mayors Table; Chees-cakes, Puffes, second Porrage, which
<PB N="37" REF="26"/>
is creame boyl'd to a height, with yelke of egges, and season'd with
sugar, and spice, Jelly which we make of the flesh of young piggs, calves
feet, and a cocke, and is excellent good, but must presently be eaten
for it will not last. Creame alone, and some done severall wayes, of
which there is great varietie, having Lymons, Lymes, and Oranges
readie at hand; and some wherein we put Plantines, Gnavers and
Bonanoes, stew'd, or preserv'd with sugar, and the same fruits also
preserv'd and put in dishes by themselves, without Creame; and
for a whetstone, to pull on a cup of wine, we have dryed Neats
tongues, brought from new and old England; and from <HI>Holland, Westa∣lia</HI>
bacon, and Caviare; as also pickl'd Herring, and Maquerell,
which we have from new <HI>England,</HI> and from <HI>Virginie Botargo</HI> of which
sort I have eaten the best at Colonel <HI>Draxes</HI> that ever I tasted.</P>
<P>The fruits that this Iland affords, I have already named, and
therefore it will be needlesse to name them twice; you may take your
choyce, whether you will have them set on the Table before or af∣ter
meat; they use as they doe in <HI>Italie,</HI> to eate them before meat.</P>
<P>The victualls brought from forraine parts are these, Beef which we
have from <HI>Holland,</HI> from Old &amp; New <HI>England, Virginie,</HI> and some from
<HI>Russia;</HI> and yet comes to us sweet. Porke from all these places, with the
most sorts of salt fish; as Ling, Haberdine, Cod, poor-John, pickled Mar∣querels,
pickled Herrings, all very good. Sturgeon from New <HI>England,</HI>
but so ill Cookt, as 'tis hardly to be eaten; for they want the skill both
of boyling &amp; seasoning it; they first overboyle it, &amp; next over salt it, &amp;
so the fish being over tender by boyling, the salt frets and eats upon it
all the way; for when we come to open it, being carried farre from the
Bridge, &amp; shaken in the carriage: there is scarce a whole peece, but the
Sturgeon and pickle all in a mash, &amp; so vehemently salt, as I could never
eate any of it, but at Colonel <HI>Wallronds</HI> plantationit it is lesse broken.</P>
<P>Pickled Turtle, we have from the Leeward Ilands, but so unclean∣ly
ordered, as we could hardly finde in our hearts to eate it; for they
gather the Salt and Sand together, for haste, upon the Iland where it
is taken up, as; though we wash it never so wel, yet the grit cracks in
our teeth; it has a taste being salted, almost as ill as puffins, which we
have from the Iles of <HI>Silly,</HI> but this kind of food, is onely for servants;
sometimes the <HI>Negroes</HI> get a little, but seldome the one or the
other did eate any bone meat, at our first comming thither.</P>
<P>But now at my comming away from thence, it was much better'd,
for by the care and good Husbandry of the Planters, there was grea∣ter
plenty, both of the victuals they were wont to eate, as Potatoes,
Bonavist, Loblolly, as also of the bone meat, <HI>viz.</HI> Porke, salt Fish; and
powder'd beefe, which came thither by sea, from forraine parts, in so
much as the <HI>Negroes</HI> were allowed each man two Maquerels a weeke
and every woman one; which were given out to them on Saturday
in the evening, after they had their allowance of Plantines, which was
every one a large bunch, or two little ones, to serve them for a weeks
provision; and if any cattle dyed by mischance, or by any disease: the
servants eat the bodies, and the <HI>Negroes</HI> the skinnes, head, and intrails
which was divided amongst them by the overseers; or if any horse,
then the whole bodies of them were distributed amongst the <HI>Negroes,</HI>
and that they thought a high feast, with which, never poor soules
were more contented; and the drinke to the servants with this dyet,
<PB N="38" REF="27"/>
nothing but Mobbie, and sometimes a little Beveridge; but the <HI>Negroes</HI>
nothing but faire water. And now I think, I have given you a just ac∣count
of the victuals that feeds the Masters, the servants, and the slaves
of this Iland: and now you see the provision the Iland affords, give
me leave to shew you what feasts they can (when they will) make
for their friends, upon their Plantations, which that I may the better
doe, I will make two bills of fare; the one for an Inland Plantation,
the other for a Plantation neer the sea, of such meat and such plenty
of that, as I have seen and eaten of, at either of those Plantations; And
for the Inland Plantation, I will make choyce of Colonel <HI>James Drax∣es,</HI>
at whose Table I have found well drest, these following meates;
for the first Course whereof there hath been two messes of meat
and both equally good, and this feast is alwayes when he kils a beef,
which he feeds extreamely fat, giving him a dozen acres of Bonavist
to go loose in, and due times of watering.</P>
<P>First then (because beefe being the greatest rarity in the Iland, espe∣cially
such as this is) I will begin with it, and of that sort there are
these dishes at either messe, a Rompe boyl'd, a Chine roasted, a large
piece of the brest roasted, the Cheeks bak'd, of which is a dish to either
messe, the tongue and part of the tripes minc't for Pyes, season'd with
sweet Herbs finely mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c't, suet, Spice and Currans; the legges, pallets
and other ingredients for an Olio Podrido to either messe, a dish of
Marrow bones, so here are 14 dishes at the Table and all of beef: and
this he intends as the great Regalio, to which he invites his fellow
planters; who having well eaten of it, the dishes are taken away, and
another Course brought in, which is a Potato pudding, a dish of Scots
Collips of a legge of Porke, as good as any in the world, a fricacy of
the same, a dish of boyl'd Chickens, a shoulder of a young Goate
drest with his bloud and tyme, a Kid with a pudding in his belly, a
sucking pig, which is there the fattest whitest &amp; sweetest in the world,
with the pognant sauce of the brains, salt, sage, and Nutmeg done
with Claret wine, a shoulder of mutton which is there a rare dish, a
Pasty of the side of a young Goate, and a side of a fat young Shot up∣on
it, well season'd with Pepper and salt, and with some Nutmeg,
a loyne of Veale, to which there wants no sauce being so well furnisht
with Oranges, Lymons, and Lymes, three young Turkies in a dish,
two Capons, of which sort I have seen some extreame large and very
fat, two henns with egges in a dish, four Ducklings, eight Turtle doves,
and three Rabbets; and for cold bak't meats, two Muscovie Ducks
larded, and season'd well with pepper and salt: and these being taken
off the Table, another course is set on, and that is of <HI>Westphalia</HI> or Spa∣nish
bacon, dried Neats Tongues, Botargo, pickled Oysters, Caviare,
Anchoves Olives, and (intermixt with these) Custards, Creams, some
alone, some with preserves of Plantines, Bonano Gnavers, put in, and
those preserv'd alone by themselves, Cheese-cakes, Puffes, which are
to be made with English flower, and bread; for the Cassavie will not
serve for this kind of Cookerie; sometimes Tansies, sometimes Froizes,
or Amulets, and for fruite, Plantines, Bonanoes, Gnavers, Milions,
prickled Peare, Anchove Peare, prickled Apple, Custard Apple, water
Milions, and Pines worth all that went before. To this meat you
seldome faile of this drink, Mobbie, Beveridge, Brandy, kill-Divell,
Drink of the Plantine, Claret wine, White wine, and Renish wine,
<PB N="39" REF="27"/>
S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erry, Canary, Red sack, wine of Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, with all Spirits that
come from <HI>England;</HI> and with all this, you shall finde as cheerfull a
look, and as hearty a welcome, as any man can give to his best
friends. And so much for a Feast of an inland Plantation.</P>
<P>Now for a Plantation neer the Sea, which shall be Collonell <HI>Wal∣rond</HI>'s,
he being the best seated for a Feast, of any I know: I must say
this, that though he be wanting in the first Course, which is Beefe;
yet, it will be plentifully supplyed in the last, which is Fish; and that
the other wants. And though Collonell <HI>Walrond,</HI> have not that infinite
store of the provisions Collonell <HI>Drax</HI> abounds in; yet, he is not wan∣ting
in all the kinds he has, unlesse it be Sheep, Goats, and Beefe, and
so for all the sorts of meats, that are in my Bill of Fare, in Collonell
<HI>Drax</HI> his Feast, you shall finde the same in Collonell <HI>Walronds,</HI> except
these three, and these are supplied with all these sorts of fish I shall
name, to wit, <HI>Mulle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, Maquerells, Parrat fish, Snappers,</HI> red and gray,
<HI>Cavallos, Terbums, Crabs, Lobsters,</HI> and <HI>Cony fish,</HI> with divers sorts more,
for which we have no names. And having these rare kinds of fishes,
'twere a vain superfluity, to make use of all those dishes I have named
before, but only such as shall serve to fill up the Table; and when he
has the ordering it, you must expect to have it excellent; his fancy
and contrivance of a Feast, being as far beyond any mans there, as the
place where he dwells is better scituate, for such a purpose. And his
Land touching the Sea, his House being not halfe a quarter of a mile
from it, and not interposed by any unlevell ground, all rarities that
are brought to the Iland, from any part of the world, are taken up,
brought to him, and stowed in his Cellars, in two hours time, and that
in the night; as, Wine, of all kinds, Oyl, Olives, Capers, Sturgeon,
Neats tongues, Anchoves, Caviare, Botargo, with all sorts of salted
meats, both flesh and fish for his Family; as, Beefe, Pork, English
Pease, Ling, Haberdine, Cod, poor John, and Jerkin Beef, which is
hufled, and slasht through, hung up and dryed in the Sun; no salt at
all put to it. And thus ordered in <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> as hot a place as <HI>Barba∣does,</HI>
and yet it will keep longer then powdred Beefe, and is as drie as
Stock-fish, and just such meat for flesh, as that is for fish, and as little
nourishment in it; but it fills the belly, and serves the turne, where
no other meat is. Though some of these may be brought to the inland
Plantations well conditioned; yet, the Wines cannot possibly come
good; for the wayes are such, as no Carts can passe; and to bring up a
But of Sack, or a Hogshead of any other Wine, upon Negres backs,
will very hardly be done in a night, so long a time it requires, to hand
it up and down the Gullies; and if it be carried in the day-time, the
Sun will heat and taint it, so as it will lose much of his spirit and pure
taste; and if it be drawn out in bottles at the <HI>Bridge,</HI> the spirits flie away
in the drawing, and you shall finde a very great difference in the
taste and quicknesse of it. Oyle will endure the carriage better then
Wine, but over much heat will abate something of the purity, and
excellent taste it has naturally. And for Olives, 'tis well known, that
jogging in the carriage causes them to bruise one another; and some
of them being bruised, will grow rotten, and infect the rest. So that
Wine, Oyle and Olives, cannot possibly be brought to such Plantati∣ons,
as are eight or ten miles from the <HI>Bridge;</HI> and from thence, the
most part of these commodities are to be fetch'd. So that you may
<PB N="40" REF="28"/>
imagine, what advantage Collonell <HI>Walrond</HI> has, of any inland Plan∣tation,
having these materialls, which are the main Regalia's in a
Feast, and his own contrivance to boot, besides all I have formerly
nam'd, concerning raw and preserv'd fruits, with all the other Quel∣quechoses.
And thus much I thought good to say for the honour of
the Iland, which is no more then truth; because I have heard it sleigh∣ted
by some, that seem'd to know much of it.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commodi∣ties Expor∣ted.</NOTE> About a hundred sail of Ships yearly visit this Iland, and receive,

<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Buil∣dings we found at our first comming upon the Iland.</NOTE> I had it in my thought before I came there, what kinde of Buildings
would be fit for a Country, that was so much troubled with heat, as
I have heard this was; &amp; did expect to find thick walls, high roofes, and
deep cellers; but found neither the one nor the other, but clean con∣trary;
timber houses, with low roofes, so low, as for the most part of
them, I could hardly stand upright with my hat on, and no cellars at
all: besides, another course they took, which was more wonder to me
than all that; which was, stopping, or barring out the winde, which
should give them the greatest comfort, when they were neer stifled
with heat. For, the winde blowing alwaies one way, which was East∣wardly,
they should have made all the openings they could to the
East, thereby to let in the cool breezes, to refresh them when the heat
of the day came. But they, clean contrary, closed up all their houses to
the East, and opened all to the West; so that in the afternoones, when
the Sun came to the West, those little low roofed rooms were like
Stoves, or heated Ovens. And truly, in a very hot day, it might raise
a doubt, whether so much heat without, and so much tobacco and
<HI>kill-devill</HI> within, might not set the house a fire; for these three in∣gredients
are strong motives to provoke it, and they were ever
there.</P>
<P>But at last I found by them, the reasons of this strange preposterous
manner of building, which was grounded upon the weakest and silli∣est
foundation that could be: For they alledged, that at the times of
rain, which was very often, the wind drave the rain in at their
windowes so fast, as the houses within were much annoyed with it;
for having no glasse to keep it out, they could seldome sit or lie drie;
and so being constrained to keep out the ayer on that side, for fear of
letting in the water, would open the West ends of their houses so
<PB N="41" REF="28"/>
wide, (as was beyond the proportion of windows to repair that
want) and so let in the fire; not considering at all, that there was such
a thing as shutters for windowes▪ to keep out the rain that hurt them,
and let in the winde to refresh them, and do them good at their plea∣sure.
But this was a consideration laid aside by all, or the most
part of the meaner fort of Planters▪ But at last I found the
true reason, was their poverty and indigence, which wanted the
means to make such conveniences; and so, being compelled by that,
had rather suffer painfully, and patiently abide this inconvenience,
than sell or part with any of their goods, to prevent so great a mis∣chiefe:
So loath poor people are to part with that, which is their next
immediate help, to support them in their great want of sustenance.
For, at that lock they often were, and some good Planters too, that
far'd very hard, when we came first into the Iland. So that hard la∣bour,
and want of victualls, had so much deprest their spirits, as they
were come to a declining and yielding condition. Nor can this be
called slothfulnesse or sluggishnesse in them, as some will have it, but
a decay of their spirits, by long and tedious hard labour, sleight fee∣ding,
and ill lodging, which is able to wear out and quell the best spi∣rit
of the world.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">What mate∣rialls grow in the Iland fit to build with, which may be call'd the Elements of Archite∣cture. And first, for Timber.</NOTE> The <HI>Locust</HI> is a tree of such a growth, both for length and bignesse,
as may serve for beams in a very large room: I have seen many of
them, whose straight bodies are above fifty foot high, the diameter of
the stem or body, three foot and halfe. The timber of this tree is a
hard close substance, heavie, but firme, and not apt to bend, some∣what
hard for tooles to cut; brittle, but lasting▪ <HI>Mastick,</HI> not altoge∣ther
so large as he, but of a tougher substance, and not accounted
so brittle. The <HI>Bully-tree</HI> wants something of the largnesse of these,
but in his other qualities goes beyond either; for, he is full out as la∣sting,
and as strong, but not so heavie, nor so hard for tooles to work.
The <HI>Redwood</HI> and <HI>prickled yellow wood,</HI> good for posts or beams, and are
lighter then the <HI>Locust;</HI> both are accounted very lasting, and good for
building. The <HI>Cedar</HI> is, without controul, the best of all; but by rea∣son
it works smoth, and looks beautifull, we use it most in Wain∣scot,
Tables, and Stooles. Other timber we have, as the <HI>Iron-wood,</HI> and
another sort, which are excellent good to endure wet and drie; and
of those we make Shingles, which being such a kinde of wood, as will
not warpe nor rive, are the best coverings for a house that can be, full
out as good as Tiles, and lie lighter upon the Rafters.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stone fit for Building.</NOTE> We have two sorts of Stone, and either will serve indifferently
well in building: The one we finde on sides of small Hills, and it lies
as ours do in <HI>England,</HI> in Quarries; but they are very small, rough,
and ill shaped, some of them porous, like Honey combes; but being
burnt, they make excellent Lyme, the whitest and firmest when 'tis
drie, that I have seen; and by the help of this, we make the better
shift with our ill shap't stone; for this lime bindes it fast together, and
keeps it firm to endure the weather. Other Stone we have, which we
find in great Rocks, and massie pieces in the ground; but so soft, as
with your finger you may bore a hole into it; and this softness gives us
the means of cutting it with two-handed sawes, which being hard,
we could not so easily do, and the easinesse causes the expedition; for
by that, we the more speedily fit it for our walls, taking a just bredth
<PB N="42" REF="29"/>
of the walls, and cutting it accordingly; so that we need very little
hewing. This stone, as we cutt it in the quarry, is no harder then or∣dinary
morter, but being set out in the weather, by pieces as we
cut it, growes indifferently hard, and is able to beare all the weight
that lyes on it, and the longer it lies, the harder it growes. Many
essayes we made, whilst I was there, for the making and burning of
bricks, but never could attaine to the perfection of it; and the reason
was, the over fatnesse of the clay, which would alwaies crackle and
break, when it felt the great heat of the fire in the Clampe; and by
no meanes could we find the true temper of it, though we made often
trialls. There was an ingenious <HI>Jew</HI> upon the Iland, whose name was
<HI>Solomon,</HI> that undertook to teach the making of it;yet for all that, when
it came to the touch his wisedome failed, and we were deceived in
our expectation, I doubt not but there is a way of tempering, to make
it farre better then ours in England; for the pots which we finde in
the Iland, wherein the <HI>Indians</HI> boyl'd their Porke, were of the same
kind of Clay, and they were the best and finest temper'd ware of
earth that ever I saw. If we could find the true temper of it, a great
advantage might be made to the Iland; for the ayre being moyst, the
stones often sweat, and by their moysture rot the timbers they touch,
which to prevent we cover the ends of our beams and girders with
boards, pitcht on both sides, but the walls being made of bricks, or
but lin'd with brick, would be much the wholesomer; and besides
keep our wainescot from rotting. Hangings we dare not use, for be∣ing
spoyld by Ants, and eaten by the Cockroaches, and Rats, yet some
of the planters that meant to handsome in their houses, were minded
to send for gilt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> leather, and hang their rooms with that, which they
were more then perswaded those vermine would not eate; and in
that resolution I left them.</P>
<P>Carpenters, and Masons, were newly come upon the Iland, and some
of these very great Masters in their Art: and such as could draw a
plot, and pursue the designe they framed with great diligence, and
beautifie the tops of their dootes, windowes, and Chimney peeces,
very pretily; but not many of those nor is it needfull that there should
be many, for though the Planters talke of building houses, and wish
them up, yet when they weigh the want of those handes in their sugar
worke, that must be imployed in their building, they fall backe, and
put on their considering caps. I drew out at least twenty plots when
I came first into the Ilands which they all lik't well inough, and yet
but two of them us'd, one by Captaine <HI>Midleton,</HI> and one by Captaine
<HI>Standfast,</HI> and those were the two best houses, I left finisht in the Iland
when I came away. Cellars I would not make under ground, unlesse
the house be set on the side of a Hill; for though the ayre be moyst a∣bove,
yet I found it by experience much moyster under ground; so
that no moyst thing can be set there, but it will in a very short time
grow mouldy, and rotten; and if for coolnesse you think to keep any
raw flesh, it will much sooner taint there, then being hung up in a
garret, where the sun continually shines upon it. Nay the pipe-staves
hoops, and heads of barrels, and hogsheads, will grow mouldy and
rotten: Pavements and foundations of bricks would much help this
with glasse windowes, to keep out the ayre.</P>
<P>If I were to build a house for my selfe in that place, I would have
<PB N="43" REF="29"/>
a third part of my building to be of an East and West line, and the
other two thirds to crosse that, at the West end: in a North and South
line, and this latter to be a story higher than that of the East and
West line, so that at four a clocke in the afternoone, the higher buil∣dings
will begin to shade the other, and so afford more and more
shade to my East and West building till night; and not only to the
house, but to all the walks that I make on either side that building,
and then I would raise my foundation of that part of my house where∣in
my best roomes were three foot above ground; leaving it hollow
underneath for Ventiducts, which I would have come into every room
in the house, and by that means you shall feele the cool breese all the
day, &amp; in the evening, when they slacken, a coole shade from my North
&amp; South building, both which are great refreshings, in ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Countryes:
and according to this Modell, I drew many plots, of severall sises and
Contrivances, but they did not or would not understand them: at last I
grew wearie of casting stones against the wind, and so gave over.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">The num∣ber and na∣ture of the inhabitants.</NOTE> It were somewhat difficult, to give you an exact account, of the
number of persons upon the Iland; there being such store of shipping
that brings passengers dayly to the place, but it has been conjectur'd,
by those that are long acquainted, and best seen in the knowledge of
the Iland, that there are not lesse then 50 thousand soules, besides
<HI>Negroes;</HI> and some of them who began upon small fortunes, are now
risen to very great and vast estates.</P>
<P>The Iland is divided into three sorts of men, <HI>viz.</HI> Masters, Servants,
and slaves. The slaves and their posterity, being subject to their Ma∣sters
for ever, are kept and preserv'd with greater care then the ser∣vants,
who are theirs but for five yeers, according to the law of the
Iland. So that for the time, the servants have the worser lives, for
they are put to very hard labour, ill lodging, and their dyet very
sleight. When we came first on the Iland, some Planters them∣selves
did not eate bone meat, above twice a weeke: the rest of the
seven dayes, Potatoes, Loblolly, and Bonavist. But the servants no
bone meat at all, unlesse an Oxe dyed: and then they were feasted, as
long as that lasted, And till they had planted good store of Plan∣tines,
the <HI>Negroes</HI> were fed with this kind of food; but most of it Bo∣navist,
and Loblolly, with some eares of Mayes toasted, which food
(especially Loblolly,) gave them much discontent: But when they
had Plantines enough to serve them, they were heard no more to
complaine; for 'tis a food they take great delight in, and their manner
of dressing and eating it, is this: 'tis gathered for them (somewhat
before it be ripe, for so they desire to have it,) upon Saturday, by the
keeper of the Plantine grove; who is an able <HI>Negro,</HI> and knowes well
the number of those that are to be fed with this fruite; and as he ga∣thers,
layes them all together, till they fetch them away, which is about
five a clock in the after noon, for that day they breake off worke soo∣ner
by an houre: partly for this purpose, and partly for that the fire in
the furnaces is to be put out, and the Ingenio and the roomes made
cleane; beside; they are to wash, shave and trim themselves against
Sunday. But 'tis a lovely sight to see a hundred handsome <HI>Negroes,</HI>
men and women, with every one a grasse-green bunch of these fruits
<PB N="44" REF="30"/>
on their heads, every bunch twice as big as their heads, all comming
in a train one after another, the black and green so well becomming
one another. Having brought this fruit home to their own houses,
and pilling off the skin of so much as they will use, they boyl it in
water, making it into balls, and so they eat it. One bunch a week is a
<HI>Negres</HI> allowance. To this, no bread nor drink, but water. Their
lodging at night a board, with nothing under, nor any thing a top of
them. They are happy people, whom so little contents. Very good
servants, if they be not spoyled by the English. But more of them
hereafter.</P>
<P>As for the usage of the Servants, it is much as the Master is, merci∣full
or cruell; Those that are mercifull, treat their Servants well, both
in their meat, drink, and lodging, and give them such work, as is not
unfit for Christians to do. But if the Masters be cruell, the Servants
have very wearisome and miserable lives. Upon the arrival of any
ship, that brings servants to the Iland, the Planters go aboard; and ha∣ving
bought such of them as they like, send them with a guid to his
Plantation; and being come, commands them instantly to make their
Cabins, which they not knowing how to do, are to be advised by
other or their servants, that are their seniors; but, if they be churlish,
and will not shew them, or if materialls be wanting, to make them
Cabins, then they are to lie on the ground that night. These Cabins
are to be made of sticks, withs, and Plantine leaves, under some little
shade that may keep the rain off; Their suppers being a few Potatoes
for meat, and water or Mobbie for drink. The next day they are rung
out with a Bell to work, at six a clock in the morning, with a severe
Overseer to command them, till the Bell ring again, which is at ele∣ven
a clock; and then they return, and are set to dinner, either with
a messe of Lob-lollie, Bonavist, or Potatoes. At one a clock, they are
rung out again to the field, there to work till six, and then home a∣gain,
to a supper of the same. And if it chance to rain, and wet them
through, they have no shift, but must lie so all night. If they put off
their cloths, the cold of the night will strike into them; and if they be
not strong men, this ill lodging will put them into a sicknesse: if they
complain, they are beaten by the Overseer; if they resist, their time is
doubled. I have seen an Overseer beat a Servant with a cane about
the head, till the blood has followed, for a fault that is not worth the
speaking of; and yet he must have patience, or worse will follow.
Truly, I have seen such cruelty there done to Servants, as I did not
think one Christian could have done to another. But, as discreeter and
better natur'd men have come to rule there, the servants lives have
been much bettered; for now, most of the servants lie in Hamocks,
and in warm rooms, and when they come in wet, have shift of shirts
and drawers, which is all the cloths they were, and are fed with <HI>bone
meat</HI> twice or thrice a week Collonell <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lrond</HI> seeing his servants when
they came home, toyled with their labour, and wet through with
their sweating, thought that shifting of their linnen not sufficient re∣freshing,
nor warmth for their bodies, their pores being much opened
by their sweating; and therefore resolved to send into <HI>England</HI> for
rug-Gownes, such as poor people wear in Hospitalls, that so when
<PB N="45" REF="30"/>
they had shifted themselves, they might put on those Gowns, and lie
down and rest them in their Hamocks: For the Hamocks being but
thin, and they having nothing on but shirts and drawers, when they
awak'd out of their sleeps, they found themselves very cold; and a
cold taken there, is harder to be recovered, than in <HI>England,</HI> by how
much the body is infeebled by the great toyle, and the Sun's heat,
which cannot but very much exhaust the spirits of bodies unaccusto∣med
to it. But this care and charity of Collonell <HI>Walrond</HI>'s, lost him
nothing in the conclusion; for, he got such love of his servants, as
they thought all too little they could do for him; and the love of the
servants there, is of much concernment to the Masters, not only in
their diligent and painfull labour, but in fore seeing and preventing
mischiefes that often happen, by the carelessnesse and slothfulnesse
of retchlesse servants; sometimes by laying fire so negligently, as whole
lands of Canes and Houses too, are burnt down and consumed, to the
utter ruine and undoing of their Masters: For, the materialls there
being all combustible, and apt to take fire, a little oversight, as the fire
of a Tobacco-pipe, being knockt out against a drie stump of a tree,
has set it on fire, and the wind fanning that fire, if a land of Canes be
but neer, and they once take fire, all that are down the winde will
be burnt up. Water there is none to quench it, or if it were, a hun∣dred
<HI>Negres</HI> with buckets were not able to do it; so violent and sprea∣ding
a fire this is, and such a noise it makes, as if two Armies, with a
thousand shot of either side, were continually giving fire, every knot
of every Cane, giving as great a report as a Pistoll. So that there is no
way to stop the going on of this flame, but by cutting down and re∣moving
all the Canes that grow before it, for the breadth of twenty
or thirty foot down the winde, and there the <HI>Negres</HI> to stand and beat
out the fire, as it creeps upon the ground, where the Canes are cut
down. And I have seen some <HI>Negres</HI> so earnest to stop this fire, as with
their naked feet to tread, and with their naked bodies to tumble, and
roll upon it; so little they regard their own smart or safety, in respect
of their Masters benefit. The year before I came away, there were
two eminent Planters in the Iland, that with such an accident as this,
lost at least 10000 l. sterling, in the value of the Canes that were
burnt; the one, Mr. <HI>James Holduppe,</HI> the other, Mr. <HI>Constantine Silvester:</HI>
And the latter had not only his Canes, but his house burnt down to
the ground. This, and much more mischiefe has been done, by the
negligence and wilfulnesse of servants. And yet some cruell Masters
will provoke their Servants so, by extream ill usage, and often and
cruell beating them, as they grow desperate, and so joyne together to
revenge themselves upon them.</P>
<P>A little before I came from thence, there was such a combination
amongst them, as the like was never seen there before. Their suffe∣rings
being grown to a great height, &amp; their daily complainings to one
another (of the intolerable burdens they labour'd under) being
spread throughout the Iland; at the last, some amongst them, whose
spirits were not able to endure such slavery, resolved to break through
it, or die in the act; and so conspired with some others of their ac∣quaintance,
whose sufferings were equall, if not above theirs; and
<PB N="46" REF="31"/>
their spirits no way inferiour, resolved to draw as many of the discon∣tented
party into this plot, as possibly they could; and those of this
perswasion, were the greatest numbers of servants in the Iland. So
that a day was appointed to fall upon their Masters, and cut all their
throats, and by that means, to make themselves not only freemen, but
Masters of the Iland. And so closely was this plot carried, as no dis∣covery
was made, till the day before they were to put it in act: And
then one of them, either by the failing of his courage, or some new
obligation from the love of his Master, revealed this long plotted con∣spiracy;
and so by this timely advertisment, the Masters were saved:
Justice <HI>Hethersall</HI> (whose servant this was) sending Letters to all his
friends, and they to theirs, and so one to another, till they were all se∣cured;
and, by examination, found out the greatest part of them;
whereof eighteen of the principall men in the conspiracy, and they
the first leaders and contrivers of the plot, were put to death, for
example to the rest. And the reason why they made examples of so
many, was, they found these so haughty in their resolutions, and so
incorrigible, as they were like enough to become actors in a second
plot; and so they thought good to secure them; and for the rest, to
have a speciall eye over them.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Negres.</NOTE> It has been accounted a strange thing, that the Negres, being more
then double the numbers of the Christians that are there, and they
accounted a bloody people, where they think they have power or ad∣vantages;
and the more bloody, by how much they are more fear∣full
than others: that these should not commit some horrid massacre
upon the Christians, thereby to enfranchise themselves, and become
Masters of the Iland. But there are three reasons that take away this
wonder; the one is, They are not suffered to touch or handle any wea∣pons:
The other, That they are held in such awe and slavery, as they
are fearfull to appear in any daring act; and seeing the mustering of
our men, and hearing their Gun-shot, (than which nothing is more
terrible to them) their spirits are subjugated to so low a condition,
as they dare not look up to any bold attempt. Besides these, there is a
third reason, which stops all designes of that kind, and that is, They
are fetch'd from severall parts of <HI>Africa,</HI> who speake severall langua∣ges,
and by that means, one of them understands not another: For,
some of them are fetch'd from <HI>Guinny</HI> and <HI>Binny,</HI> some from <HI>Cutchew,</HI>
some from <HI>Angola,</HI> and some from the River of <HI>Gambra.</HI> And in some
of these places where petty Kingdomes are, they sell their Subjects,
and such as they take in Battle, whom they make slaves; and some
mean men sell their Servants, their Children, and sometimes their
Wives; and think all good traffick, for such commodities as our Mer∣chants
sends them.</P>
<P>When they are brought to us, the Planters buy them out of the
Ship, where they find them stark naked, and therefore can not be de∣ceived
in any outward infirmity. They choose them as they do Horses
in a Market; the strongest, youthfullest, and most beautifull, yield
the greatest prices. Thirty pound sterling is a price for the best
man Negre; and twenty five, twenty six, or twenty seven pound for
a Woman; the Children are at easier rates. And we buy them so, as
<PB N="47" REF="31"/>
the sexes may be equall; for, if they have more men then women, the
men who are unmarried will come to their Masters, and complain,
that they cannot live without Wives, and desire him, they may have
Wives. And he tells them, that the next ship that comes, he will buy
them Wives, which satisfies them for the present; and so they expect
the good time: which the Master performing with them, the bravest
fellow is to choose first, and so in order, as they are in place; and eve∣ry
one of them knowes his better, and gives him the precedence, as
Cowes do one another, in passing through a narrow gate; for, the most
of them are as neer beasts as may be, setting their souls aside. Reli∣gion
they know none; yet most of them acknowledge a God, as ap∣pears
by their motions and gestures: For, if one of them do another
wrong, and he cannot revenge himselfe, he looks up to Heaven for
vengeance, and holds up both his hands, as if the power must come
from thence, that must do him right. Chast they are as any people
under the Sun; for, when the men and women are together naked,
they never cast their eyes towards the parts that ought to be covered;
and those amongst us, that have Breeches and Petticoats, I never saw
so much as a kisse, or embrace, or a wanton giance with their eyes
between them. Jealous they are of their Wives, and hold it for a
great injury and scorn, if another man make the least courtship to his
Wife. And if any of their Wives have two Children at a birth, they
conclude her false to his Bed, and so no more adoe but hang her.
We had an excellent Negre in the Plantation, whose name was <HI>Macow,</HI>
and was our chiefe Musitian; a very valiant man, and was keeper of
our Plantine-groave. This Negres Wife was brought to bed of two
Children, and her Husband, as their manner is, had provided a cord
to hang her. But the Overseer finding what he was about to do, en∣formed
the Master of it, who sent for <HI>Macow,</HI> to disswade him from
this cruell act, of murdering his Wife, and used all perswasions that
possibly he could, to let him see, that such double births are in Na∣ture,
and that divers presidents were to be found amongst us of the
like; so that we rather praised our Wives, for their fertility, than
blamed them for their falsenesse. But this prevailed little with him,
upon whom custome had taken so deep an impression; but resolved,
the next thing he did, should be to hang her. Which when the Master
perceived, and that the ignorance of the man, should take away the
life of the woman, who was innocent of the crime her Husband con∣demned
her for, told him plainly, that if he hang'd her, he himselfe
should be hang'd by her, upon the same bough; and therefore wish'd
him to consider what he did. This threatning wrought more with
him, then all the reasons of Philosophy that could be given him;
and so let her alone; but he never car'd much for her afterward, but
chose another which he lik'd better. For the Planters there deny
not a slave, that is a brave fellow, and one that has extraordinary
qualities, two or three Wives, and above that number they seldome
go: But no woman is allowed above one Husband.</P>
<P>At the time the wife is to be brought a bed, her husband removes
his board, (which is his bed) to another room (for many severall divi∣sions
they have, in their little houses,) and none above sixe foot square)
<PB N="48" REF="32"/>
And leaves his wife to God, and her good fortune, in the room, and
upon the board alone, and calls a neighbour to come to her, who
gives little help to her deliverie, but when the child is borne, (which
she calls her Pickaninnie) she helps to make a little fire nere her feet
and that serves instead of Possets, Broaths, and Caudles. In a fort∣night,
this woman is at worke with her Pickaninny at her back, as
merry a soule as any is there: If the overseer be discreet, shee is
suffer'd to rest her selfe a little more then ordinary; but if not, shee is
compelled to doe as others doe. Times they have of suckling their
Children in the fields, and refreshing themselves; and good reason, for
they carry burdens on their backs; and yet work too. Some women,
whose Pickaninnies are three yeers old, will, as they worke at weed∣ing,
which is a stooping worke, suffer the hee Pickaninnie, to sit astride
upon their backs, like St. <HI>George</HI> a horse back; and there spurre his
mother with his heeles, and sings and crowes on her backe, clapping
his hands, as if he meant to flye; which the mother is so pleas'd with,
as shee continues her painfull stooping posture, longer then she would
doe, rather than discompose her Joviall Pickaninnie of his pleasure,
so glad she is to see him merry. The worke which the women doe,
is most of it weeding, a stooping and painfull worke; at noon and night
they are call'd home by the ring of a Bell, where they have two hours
time for their repast at noone; and at night, they rest from sixe, till sixe
a Clock next morning.</P>
<P>On Sunday they rest, and have the whole day at their pleasure; and
the most of them use it as a day of rest and pleasure; but some of them
who will make benefit of that dayes liberty, goe where the Man∣grave
trees grow, and gather the barke of which they make
ropes, which they trucke away for other Commoditie, as shirts
and drawers.</P>
<P>In the afternoons on Sundayes, they have their musicke, which
is of kettle drums, and those of severall sises; upon the smallest the
best musitian playes, and the other come in as Chorasses: the drum all
men know, has but one tone; and therefore varietie of tunes have little
to doe in this musick; and yet so strangely they varie their time, as 'tis
a pleasure to the most curious eares, and it was to me one of the stran∣gest
noyses that ever I heard made of one tone; and if they had the
varietie of tune, which gives the greater scope in musick, as they have
of time, they would doe wonders in that Art. And if I had not faln
sicke before my comming away, at least seven months in one sickness,
I had given them some hints of tunes, which being understood,
would have serv'd as a great addition to their harmonie; for
time without tune, is not an eighth part of the science of Mu∣sick.</P>
<P>I found <HI>Macow</HI> very apt for it of himselfe, and one day comming
into the house, (which none of the <HI>Negroes</HI> use to doe, unlesse an Offi∣cer,
as he was,) he found me playing on a Theorbo, and sinking to it
which he hearkened very attentively to; and when I had done
took the Theorbo in his hand, and strooke one string, stopping it by
degrees upon every fret, and finding the notes to varie, till it came to
the body of the instrument; and that the neerer the body of the in∣strument
<PB N="49" REF="32"/>
he stopt, the smaller or higher the sound was, which he found
was by the shortning of the string, considered with himselfe, how he
might make some triall of this experiment upon such an instrument
as he could come by; having no hope ever to have any instrument of
this kind to practise on. In a day or two after, walking in the Plan∣tine
grove, to refresh me in that cool shade, and to delight my selfe
with the sight of those plants, which are so beautifull, as though they
left a fresh impression in me when I parted with them, yet upon a re∣view,
something is discern'd in their beautie more then I remem∣bred
at parting: which caused me to make often repair thither; I
found this <HI>Negro</HI> (whose office it was to attend there) being the keep∣er
of that grove, sitting on the ground, and before him a piece of large
timber, upon which he had laid crosse, sixe Billets, and having a hand∣saw
and a hatchet by him, would cut the billets by little and little,
till he had brought them to the tunes, he would fit them to; for the
shorter they were, the higher the Notes which he tryed by knocking
upon the ends of them with a sticke, which he had in his hand. When
I found him at it, I took the stick out of his hand, and tried the
sound, finding the sixe billets to have sixe distinct notes, one above a∣nother,
which put me in a wonder, how he of himselfe, should with∣out
teaching doe so much. I then shewed him the difference between
flats and sharpes, which he presently apprehended, as between <HI>Fa,</HI> and
<HI>Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and he would have cut two more billets to those tunes, but I had
then no time to see it done, and so left him to his own enquiries.
I say this much to let you see that some of these people are capable of
learning Arts.</P>
<P>Another, of another kinde of speculation I found; but more inge∣nious
then he: and this man with three or foure more, were to attend
mee into the woods, to cut Church wayes, for I was imployed some∣times
upon publique works; and those men were excellent Axe-men,
and because there were many gullies in the way, which were impassa∣ble,
and by that means I was compell'd to make traverses, up and
down in the wood; and was by that in danger to misse of the poynt
to which I was to make my passage to the Church, and therefore was
faine to take a Compasse with me, which was a Circumferenter, to
make my traverses the more exact, and indeed without which, it
could not be done, setting up the Circumferenter, and observing the
Needle: This <HI>Negre Sambo</HI> comes to me, and seeing the needle wag,
desired to know the reason of its stirring, and whether it were alive:
I told him no, but it stood upon a poynt, and for a while it would stir,
but by and by stand still, which he observ'd and found it to be true.</P>
<P>The next question was, why it stood one way, &amp; would not remove
to any other poynt, I told him that it would stand no way but North
and South, and upon that shew'd him the foure Cardinall poynts of
the compass, East, West, North, South, which he presently learnt by
heart, and promis'd me never to forget it. His last question was,
why it would stand North, I gave this reason, because of the huge
Rocks of Loadstone that were in the North part of the world, which
had a quality to draw Iron to it; and this Needle being of Iron, and
toucht with a Loadstone, it would alwaies stand that way.</P>
<PB N="50" REF="33"/>
<P>This point of Philosophy was a little too hard for him, and so he
stood in a strange muse; which to put him out of, I bad him reach his
ax, and put it neer to the Compasse, and remove it about; and as he
did so, the Needle turned with it, which put him in the greatest ad∣miration
that ever I saw a man, and so quite gave over his questions,
and desired me, that he might be made a Christian; for, he thought
to be a Christian, was to be endued with all those knowledges he
wanted.</P>
<P>I promised to do my best endeavour; and when I came home,
spoke to the Master of the Plantation, and told him, that poor <HI>Sambo</HI>
desired much to be a Christian. But his answer was, That the peo∣ple
of that Iland were governed by the Lawes of <HI>England,</HI> and by
those Lawes, we could not make a Christian a Slave. I told him, my
request was far different from that, for I desired him to make a Slave
a Christian. His answer was, That it was true, there was a great
difference in that: But, being once a Christian, he could no more
account him a Slave, and so lose the hold they had of them as
Slaves, by making them Christians; and by that means should open
such a gap, as all the Planters in the Iland would curse him. So I
was struck mute, and poor <HI>Sambo</HI> kept out of the Church; as in∣genious,
as honest, and as good a natur▪d poor soul, as ever wore black,
or eat green.</P>
<P>On Sundaies in the afternoon, their Musick plaies, and to dancing
they go, the men by themselves, and the women by themselves, no
mixt dancing. Their motions are rather what they aim at, than what
they do; and by that means, transgresse the lesse upon the Sunday;
their hands having more of motion than their feet, &amp; their heads more
than their hands. They may dance a whole day, and neer heat them∣selves;
yet, now and then, one of the activest amongst them will leap
bolt upright, and fall in his place again, but without cutting a capre.
When they have danc'd an houre or two, the men fall to wrastle, (the
Musick playing all the while) and their manner of wrastling is, to
stand like two Cocks, with heads as low as their hipps; and thrusting
their heads one against another, hoping to catch one another by the
leg, which sometimes they do: But if both parties be weary, and that
they cannot get that advantage, then they raise their heads, by pres∣sing
hard one against another, and so having nothing to take hold of
but their bare flesh, they close, and grasp one another about the mid∣dle,
and have one another in the hug, and then a fair fall is given on
the back. And thus two or three couples of them are engaged at once,
for an houre together, the women looking on: for when the men be∣gin
to wrastle, the women leave of their dancing, and come to be spe∣ctatours
of the sport.</P>
<P>When any of them die, they dig a grave, and at evening they bury
him, clapping and wringing their hands, and making a dolefull sound
with their voyces. They are a people of a timerous and fearfull dis∣position,
and consequently bloody, when they finde advantages. If
any of them commit a fault, give him present punishment, but do not
threaten him; for if you do, it is an even lay, he will go and hang him∣selfe,
to avoid the punishment.</P>
<PB N="51" REF="33"/>
<P>What their other opinions are in matter of Religion, I know not;
but certainly, they are not altogether of the sect of the <HI>Saddu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es:</HI> For,
they believe a Resurrection, and that they shall go into their own
Country again, and have their youth renewed. And lodging this opi∣nion
in their hearts, they make it an ordinary practice, upon
any great fright, or threatning of their Masters, to hang them
selves.</P>
<P>But Collonell <HI>Walrond</HI> having lost three or foure of his best Negres
this way, and in a very little time, caused one of their heads to be cut
off, and set upon a pole a dozen foot high; and having done that,
caused all his Negres to come forth, and march round about this
head, and bid them look on it, whether this were not the head of such
an one that hang'd himselfe. Which they acknowledging, he then told
them, That they were in a main errour, in thinking they went into
their own Countries, after they were dead; for, this mans head was
here, as they all were witnesses of; and how was it possible, the body
could go without a head. Being convinc'd by this sad, yet lively spe∣ctacle,
they changed their opinions; and after that, no more hanged
themselves.</P>
<P>When they are sick, there are two remedies that cure them; the
one, an outward, the other, an inward medicine. The outward me∣dicine
is a thing they call <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gre-oyle,</HI> and 'tis made in <HI>Barbary,</HI> yellow
it is as Bees wax, but soft as butter. When they feel themselves ill,
they call for some of that, and annoint their bodies, as their breasts,
bellies, and sides, and in two daies they are perfectly well. But this
does the greatest cures upon such, as have bruises or strains in their
bodies. The inward medicine is taken, when they find any weakness
or decay in their spirits and stomacks, and then a dram or two of <HI>kill∣devill</HI>
revives and comforts them much.</P>
<P>I have been very strict, in observing the shapes of these people; and
for the men, they are very well timber'd, that is, broad between the
shoulders, full breasted, well filleted, and clean leg'd, and may hold
good with <HI>Albert Durers</HI> rules, who allowes <HI>twice the length of the head,</HI> to
the breadth of the shoulders; and twice the <HI>length of the face,</HI> to the
breadth of the hipps, and according to this rule these men are shap'd.
But the women not; for the same great Master of Proportions, allowes
to each woman, twice the length of the face to the breadth of the
shoulders, and twice the length of her own head to the breadth of the
hipps. And in that, these women are faulty; for I have seen very few
of them, whose hipps have been broader then their shoulders, unlesse
they have been very fat. The young Maides have ordinarily ve∣ry
large breasts, which stand strutting out so hard and firm, as no lea∣ping,
jumping, or stirring, will cause them to shake any more, then
the brawnes of their armes. But when they come to be old, and have
had five or six Children, their breasts hang down below their navells,
so that when they stoop at their common work of weeding, they hang
almost down to the ground, that at a distance, you would think they
had six legs: And the reason of this is, they tie the cloaths about
their Children's backs, which comes upon their breasts, which by
pressing very hard, causes them to hang down to that length. Their
<PB N="52" REF="34"/>
Children, when they are first born, have the palmes of their hands
and the soles of their feet, of a whitish colour, and the sight of their
eyes of a blewish colour, not unlike the eyes of a young Kitling; but,
as they grow older, they become black.</P>
<P>Their way of reckoning their ages, or any other notable accident
they would remember, is by the Moon; and so accounting from the
time of their Childrens births, the time they were brought out of
their own Country, or the time of their being taken Prisoners, by
some Prince or Potentate of their own Country, or any other notori∣ous
accidents, that they are resolved to remember, they account by
the Moon; as, so many Moons since one of these, and so many Moons
since another; and this account they keep as long as they can: But if
any of them live long, their Arithmetick failes them, and then they
are at a dead fault, and so give over the chase, wanting the skill to
hunt counter. For what can poor people do, that are without Letters
and Numbers, which is the soul of all businesse that is acted by Mor∣talls,
upon the Clobe of this World.</P>
<P>Some of them, who have been bred up amongst the Portugalls,
have some extraordinary qualities, which the others have not; as
singing and fencing. I have seen some of these <HI>Portugall Negres,</HI> at
Collonell <HI>James Draxes,</HI> play at Rapier and Dagger very skilfully,
with their Stooka dos, their Imbrocados, and their Passes: And at sin∣gle
Rapier too, after the manner of <HI>Charanza,</HI> with such comelinesse;
as, if the skill had been wanting, the motions would have pleased
you; but they were skilfull too, which I perceived by their binding
with their points, and nimble and subtle avoidings with their bodies,
and the advantages the strongest man had in the close, which the
other avoided by the nimblenesse and skilfulnesse of his motion.
For, in this Science, I had bin so well vers'd in my youth, as I was now
able to be a competent Judge. Upon their first appearance upon the
Stage, they march towards one another, with a slow majestick pace,
and a bold commanding look, as if they meant both to conquer; and
comming neer together, they shake hands, and embrace one another,
with a cheerfull look. But their retreat is much quicker then their ad∣vance,
and, being at first distance, change their countenance, and put
themselves into their posture; and so after a passe or two, retire, and
then to't again: And when they have done their play, they embrace,
shake hands, and putting on their smoother countenances, give their
respects to their Master, and so go off. For their Singing, I cannot
much commend that, having heard so good in <HI>Europe;</HI> but for their
voices, I have heard many of them very loud and sweet.</P>
<P>Excellent Swimmers and Divers they are, both men and women.
Collonell <HI>Drax (who was not so strict an observer of Sundaies,</HI> as to deny
himselfe lawfull recreations) would sometimes, to shew me sport,
upon that day in the afternoon, send for one of the <HI>Muscovia</HI> Ducks,
and have her put into his largest Pond, and calling for some of his
best swimming Negres, commanded them to swim and take this
Duck; but forbad them to dive, for if they were not bar'd that play,
they would rise up under the Duck, and take her as she swome, or
meet her in her diving, and so the sport would have too quick an end.
<PB N="53" REF="34"/>
but that play being forbidden, the duck would make them good sport
for they are stronger ducks, and better Divers by farre then ours: and
in this chase, there was much of pleasure, to see the various swim∣mings
of the <HI>Negroes;</HI> some the ordinarie wayes, upon their bellies,
some on their backs, some by striking out their right legge and left
arme, and then turning on the other side, and changing both their
legge and arme, which is a stronger and swifter way of swimming,
then any of the others: and while we were seeing this sport, and obser∣ving
the diversities, of their swimmings, a <HI>Negro</HI> maid, who was not
there at the beginning of the sport; and therefore heard nothing of
the forbidding them to dive, put off her peticoate behind a bush,
that was at one end of the Pond, and closely sunk down into the
water, and at one diving got to the Duck, pul'd her under water,
&amp; went back againe the same way she came to the bush, all at one dive.
We all thought the Duck had div'd: and expected her appearance
above water, but nothing could be seen, till the subtilty was disco∣vered,
by a Christian that saw her go in, and so the duck was taken
from her. But the trick being so finely and so closely done, I begg'd
that the Duck might be given her againe, which was granted, and the
young girle much pleased.</P>
<P>Though there be a marke set upon these people, which will hardly
ever be wip'd off, as of their cruelties when they have advantages,
and of their fearfulnesse and falsnesse; yet no rule so generall but hath
his acception: for I beleive, and I have strong motives to cause me to
bee of that perswasion, that there are as honest, faithfull, and conscio∣nable
people amongst them, as amongst those of <HI>Europe,</HI> or any other
part of the world.</P>
<P>A hint of this, I will give you in a lively example; and it was in a time
when Victuals were scarce, and Plantins were not then so frequently
planted, as to afford them enough. So that some of the high spirited
and turbulent amongst them, began to mutinie, and had a plot, se∣cretly
to be reveng'd on their Master, and one or two of these were
Firemen that made the fires in the furnaces, who were never without
store of drie wood by them. These villains, were resolved to make
fire to such part of the boyling house, as they were sure would fire the
rest, and so burn all, and yet seem ignorant of the fact, as a thing done
by accident. But this plot was discovered, by some of the others
who hated mischiefe, as much as they lov'd it; and so traduc't them to
their Master, and brought in so many witnesses against them, as they
were forc't to confesse, what they meant should have been put in act
the next night: so giving them condigne punishment, the Master gave
order to the overseer that the rest should have a dayes liberty to
themselves and their wives, to doe what they would; and withall to
allow them a double proportion of victual for three dayes, both which
they refus'd: which we all wonder'd at knowing well how much they
lov'd their liberties, and their meat, having been lately pincht of the
one, and not having overmuch of the other; and therefore being
doubtfull what their meaning was in this, suspecting some discontent
amongst them, sent for three or foure of the best of them, and desir'd
to know why they refus'd this favour that was offer'd them, but
<PB N="54" REF="35"/>
receiv'd such an answer: as we little expected; for they told us, it was
not sullennesse, or slighting the gratuitie their Master bestow'd on
them, but they would not accept any thing as a recompence for doing
that which became them in their duties to due, nor would they have
him think, it was hope of reward, that made them to accuse their
fellow servants, but an act of Justice, which they thought themselves
bound in duty to doe, and they thought themselves sufficiently re∣warded
in the Act. The substance of this, in such language as they
had, they delivered, and poor <HI>Sambo</HI> was the Orator; by whose exam∣ple
the others were led both in the discovery of the Plot, and refuse∣all
of the gratuitie. And withall they said, that if it pleas'd their
Master, at any time, to bestow a voluntary boone upon them, be it ne∣ver
so sleight, they would willingly and thankfully accept it: &amp; this act
might have beseem'd the best Christians, though some of them were
denied Christianity; when they earnestly sought it. Let others have
what opinion they please, yet I am of this beliefe; that there are to be
found amongst them, some who are as morally honest, as Conscionable,
as humble, as loving to their friends, and as loyall to their Masters, as
any that live under the sunne, &amp; one reason they have to be so, is, they
set no great value upon their lives: And this is all I can remember
concerning the <HI>Negroes,</HI> except of their games, which I could never
learne, because they wanted language to teach me.</P>
<P>As for the Indians, we have but few, and those fetcht from o∣ther
Countries; some from the neighbouring Ilands, some from the
Maine, which we make slaves: the women who are better verst in
ordering the Cassavie and making bread, then the <HI>Negroes,</HI> we
imploye for that purpose, as also for making Mobbie: the men we
use for footmen, and killing of fish which they are good at; with their
own bowes and arrows they will go out; and in a dayes time, kill as
much fish, as will serve a family of a dozen persons, two or three daies,
if you can keep the fish so long. They are very active men, and apt
to learne any thing, sooner then the <HI>Negroes;</HI> and as different from them
in shape, almost as in colour; the men very broad shoulder'd, deep
breasted, with large heads, and their faces almost three square, broad
about the eyes and temples, and sharpe at the chinne, their skins some
of them brown, some a bright Bay, they are much craftier, and subtiler
then the <HI>Negroes;</HI> and in their nature falser; but in their bodies more
active, their women have very small breasts, and have more of the
shape of the <HI>Europeans</HI> then the <HI>Negroes,</HI> their haire black and long,
a great part whereof hangs downe upon their backs, as low as their
hanches, with a large lock hanging over either brest, which seldome
or never curles: cloaths they scorne to weare, especially if they be well
shap't; a girdle they use of tape, covered with little smooth shels of
fishes, white, and from their flanke of one side, to their flank on the
other side, a fringe of blew Bugle; which hangs so low as to cover their
privities. We had an Indian woman, a slave in the house, who was
of excellent shape and colour, for it was a pure bright bay; small brests,
with the nipls of a porphyrie colour, this woman would not be woo'd
by any means to weare Cloaths. Shee chanc't to be with Child, by a
Christian servant, and lodging in the Indian house, amongst other
<PB N="55" REF="35"/>
women of her own Country, where the Christian servants, both men
and women came; and being very great, and that her time was come
to be delivered, loath to fall in labour before the men, walk'd down
to a Wood, in which was a Pond of water, and there by the side of
the Pond, brought her selfe a bed; and presently washing her
Child in some of the water of the Pond, lap'd it up in such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ags, as
she had begg'd of the Christians; and in three hours time came home,
with her Childe in her armes, a lusly Boy, frolick and lively.</P>
<P>This Indian dwelling neer the Sea-coast, upon the Main, an English
ship put in to a Bay, and sent some of her men a shoar, to try what
victualls or water they could finde, for in some distresse they were:
But the Indians perceiving them to go up so far into the Country,
as they were sure they could not make a safe retreat, intercepted them
in their return, and fell upon them, chasing them into a Wood, and
being dispersed there, some were taken, and some kill'd: but a young
man amongst them stragling from the rest, was met by this Indian
Maid, who upon the first sight fell in love with him, and hid him close
from her Countrymen (the Indians) in a Cave, and there fed him,
till they could safely go down to the shoar, where the ship lay at an∣chor,
expecting the return of their friends. But at last, seeing them up∣on
the shoar, sent the long-Boat for them, took them aboard, and
brought them away. But the youth, when he came ashoar in the <HI>Bar∣badoes,</HI>
forgot the kindnesse of the poor maid, that had ventured her
life for his safety, and sold her for a slave, who was as free born as he:
And so poor <HI>Yarico</HI> for her love, lost her liberty.</P>
<P>Now for the Masters, I have yet said but little, nor am able to say
halfe of what they deserve. They are men of great abilities and parts,
otherwise they could not go through, with such great works as they
undertake; the managing of one of their Plantations, being a work
of such a latitude, as will require a very good head-peece, to put in
order, and continue it so.</P>
<P>I can name a Planter there, that feeds daily two hundred mouths,
and keeps them in such order, as there are no mutinies amongst themi
and yet of severall nations. All these are to be employed in their seve∣rall
abilities, so as no one be idle. The first work to be considered, is
Weeding, for unlesse that be done, all else (and the Planter too) will
be undone; and if that be neglected but a little time, it will be a hard
matter to recover it again, so fast will the weeds grow there. But the
ground being kept clean, 'tis fit to bear any thing that Country will
afford. After weeding comes Planting, and they account two seasons
in the year best, and that is, <HI>May</HI> and <HI>November;</HI> but Canes are to be
planted at all times, that they may come in, one field after another;
otherwise, the work will stand still. And commonly they have in a
field that is planted together, at one time ten or a dozen acres. This
work of planting and weeding, the Master himselfe is to see done;
unlesse he have a very trusty and able Overseer; and without such a
one, he will have too much to do. The next thing he is to consider,
is the Ingenio, and what belongs to that; as, the Ingenio it selfe,
which is the <HI>Primum Mobile</HI> of the whole work, the Boyling-house,
with the Coppers and Furnaces, the Filling room, the Still-house,
<PB N="56" REF="36"/>
and Cureing-house; and in all these, there are great casualties. If any
thing in the Rollers, as the Goudges, Sockets, Sweeps, Cogs, or Bray∣trees,
be at fault, the whole work stands still; or in the Boyling-house,
if the Frame which holds the Coppers, (and is made of Clinkers,
fastned with plaister of <HI>Paris)</HI> if by the violence of the heat from the
Furnaces, these Frames crack or break, there is a stop in the work, till
that be mended. Or if any of the Coppers have a mischance, and be
burnt, a new one must presently be had, or there is a stay in the work.
Or if the mouths of the Furnaces, (which are made of a sort of stone,
which we have from <HI>England,</HI> and we call it there, high gate stone) if
that, by the violence of the fire, be softned, that it moulder away,
there must new be provided, and laid in with much art, or it will not
be. Or if the barrs of Iron, which are in the flowre of the Furnace,
when they are red hot, (as continually they are) the fire-man,
throw great shides of wood in the mouths of the Furnaces, hard
and carelesly, the weight of those logs, will bend or break those barrs,
(though strongly made) and there is no repairing them, without the
work stand still; for all these depend upon one another, as wheels in
a Clock. Or if the Stills be at fault, the <HI>kill-devill</HI> cannot be made.
But the main impediment and stop of all, is the losse of our Cattle,
and amongst them, there are such diseases, as I have known in one
Plantation, thirty that have died in two daies. And I have heard, that
a Planter, an eminent man there, that clear'd a dozen acres of ground,
and rail'd it about for pasture, with intention, as soon as the grasse
was growne to a great height, to put in his working Oxen; which ac∣cordingly
he did, and in one night fifty of them dyed; so that such a
losse as this, is able to undo a Planter, that is not very well grounded.
What it is that breeds these diseases, we cannot finde, unlesse some
of the Plants have a poysonous quality; nor have we yet found out
cures for these diseases; Chickens guts being the best remedy was then
known, and those being chopt or minc't, and given them in a horn,
with some liquor mixt to moisten it, was thought the best remedy; yet
it recovered very few. Our Horses too have killing diseases amongst
them, and some of them have been recovered by Glisters, which we
give them in pipes, or large seringes made of wood, for the same pur∣pose.
For, the common diseases, both of Cattle and Horses, are ob∣structions
and bindings in their bowells; and so lingring a disease it is,
to those that recover, as they are almost worn to nothing before they
get well. So that if any of these stops continue long, or the Cattle
cannot be recruited in a reasonable time, the work is at a stand; and
by that means, the Canes grow over ripe, and will in a very short
time have their juice dried up, and will not be worth the grin∣ding.</P>
<P>Now to recruit these Cattle, Horses, Camells, and Assinigos, who
are all lyable to these mischances and decaies, Merchants must be con∣sulted,
ships provided, and a competent Cargo of goods adventured,
to make new voyages to forraigne parts, to supply those losses; and
when that is done, the casualties at Sea are to be considered, and those
happen severall waies, either by shipwrack, piracy, or fire. A Master
of a ship, and a man accounted both able, stout, and honest, having
<PB N="57" REF="36"/>
transported goods of severall kinds, from <HI>England</HI> to a part of <HI>Africa,</HI>
the River of <HI>Gambra,</HI> and had there exchanged his Commodities for
<HI>Negres,</HI> which was that he intended to make his voyage of, caused
them all to be shipt, and did not, as the manner is, shakle one to ano∣ther,
and make them sure; but having an opinion of their honesty and
faithfulnesse to him, as they had promised; and he being a credulous
man, and himselfe good natur'd and mercifull, suffered them to go
loose, and they being double the number of those in the ship, found
their advantages, got weapons in their hands, and fell upon the Say∣lers,
knocking them on the heads, and cutting their throats so fast, as
the Master found they were all lost, out of any possibility of saving;
and so went down into the Hold, and blew all up with himselfe; and
this was before they got out of the River. These, and severall other
waies there will happen, that extreamly retard the work of Suger-making.</P>
<P>Now let us consider how many things there are to be thought on,
that go to the actuating this great work, and how many cares to pre∣vent
the mischances, that are incident to the retarding, if not the
frustrating of the whole work; and you will finde them wise and pro∣vident
men, that go on and prosper in a work, that depends upon so
many contingents.</P>
<P>This I say, to stop those mens mouths, that lie here, at home, and
expect great profit in their adventures, and never consider, through
what difficulty, industry, and paines it is acquired▪ And thus much I
thought good to say, of the abilities of the Planters.</P>
<P>The next thing is, of their natures and dispositions, which I found
compliable in a high degree to all vertues, that those of the best sort
of Gentlemen call Excellent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as, Civilly intreating of Strangers, with
communicating to them any thing within the compasse of their
knowledge, that might be beneficiall to them, in any undertaking
amongst them, and assisting them in it, giving them harbour for them∣selves
and servants. And if their intentions were to buy Plantations,
to make diligent inquiries for such as they desired, and to drive the
bargain as neer the winde for their advantages, as possibly they could,
and to put themselves in some travells, in setling the businesse: Or,
if that could not do them service, to recommend them to any friend
they had, that lay more fit and convenient for their purpose. Loving,
friendly, and hospitable one to another; and though they are of seve∣rall
Perswasions, yet, their discretions ordered every thing so well, as
there never were any fallings out between them: which to prevent,
some of them of the better sort, made a Law amongst themselves, that
whosoever nam'd the word <HI>Roundhead</HI> or <HI>Cavalier,</HI> should give to all
those that heard him, a Shot and a Turky, to be eaten at his house that
made the forfeiture; which sometimes was done purposely, that they
might enjoy the company of one another; and sometimes this Shot
and this Turky would draw on a dozen dishes more, if company were
accordingly: So frank, so loving, and so good natur'd were these Gen∣tlemen
one to another; and to expresse their affections yet higher,
they had particular names one to another, as, Neighbour, Friend,
Brother, Sister▪ So that I perceived nothing wanting, that might make
<PB N="58" REF="37"/>
up a firme and lasting friendship amongst them; though after I came
away, it was otherwise.</P>
<P>Sports and exercises they never us'd any, as Bowling, Shooting,
Hunting, or Hawking; for indeed there are no places fit for the two
first exercises, the Countrey being so Rocky, uneven and full of stumps
of trees: and for the other two, they want game; for there are no kind
of wild beasts in the Iland, nor any foule fit to hawk at; besides the
Country is so woody, as there is no Champian to flye in; Pheasants,
Partridges, Heathpoults, Quailes, or Rayles, never set foot upon this
ground, unlesse they were brought there; and if so, they never liv'd
and for Hawkes, I never saw but two, and those the merriest stirrers
that ever I saw flye; the one of them was in an evening just at
sunne setting, which is the time the Bats rise, and so are to a good
height; and at a downecome, this Barbary faulcon took one of them
and carried it away.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tame beasts that are li∣ving on the Iland. Camels.</NOTE> If I shall begin with the largest first I must name Camells, and these
are very usefull beasts, but very few will live upon the Iland: divers
have had them brought over, but few know how to diet them. Cap∣taine
<HI> Higginbotham</HI> had foure or five, which were of excellent use,
not only of carrying down sugar to the bridge,but of bringing from
thence hogsheads of Wine, Beer, or Vinegar, which horses cannot do,
nor can Carts pass for Gullies, and <HI>Negroes</HI> cannot carry it, for the rea∣sons
afore mentioned; a good Camell will carry 1600 l. weight, and
go the surest of any beast.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Horses.</NOTE> We have from severall parts of the world, <HI>England, Holland, Bona∣vista,</HI>
the <HI>Iles</HI> of <HI>Cape Verd, Virginie, New England,</HI> and some from one of
the <HI>Leeward Ilands</HI> in the <HI>Carribbies</HI> call'd <HI>Currissa,</HI> besides some we breed
and very strong and good mettled, bold and fit to charge on: these hor∣ses
we use either for the Ingenio, or the Saddle, seldom or never for
carrying sugar, the gullies being so steep.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oxen, Bulls, and Cowes.</NOTE> We have from the severall places I have nam'd, but chiefly Bulls,
from the Ile of <HI>May,</HI> and <HI>Bonavista;</HI> which are Cattell, being well
taught, will work the orderliest that I have seen any. With these, we
have Cowes, and some of them we use for the Payle, and some for the
Ingenio, some we breed, and have speedier increase then in <HI>Europe,</HI> for
here a Calfe will bring a Calfe in fourteen months; and if it were not
for the diseases that take away our Cattell, we should not need to
fetch any from forraine parts.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Assinigoes.</NOTE> Are here of exceeding great use in the Iland, in carrying our sugars
down to the bridge which by reason of the gullies, the Horses cannot
doe: besides when the great raines fall the wayes are so deep, and full
of roots, as when a horse puts in his legge between two roots, he can
hardly pull it out againe, having a great weight on his back; and if he
fall, 'tis hard lifting him up. Whereas the Assinigoes pick and choose
their way, and sometimes choose out little wayes in the wood, such
as they know are fit for them to passe, which horses cannot doe, be∣cause
the wayes are too narrow for them, or if they were not, they
would want much the wit of the Assinigoes, to pick and choose their
way. And if by chance the Assinigoes fall, two <HI>Negroes</HI> are able to
help him up, and we seldome use more then two, for assistance to the
<PB N="59" REF="37"/>
Christian that has the charge of the carriages. One of these Assini∣goes
will carry 150 weight of sugar; some of the strongest 200
weight; our Planters have been very desirous if it were possible to get
Mules there, for they would be of excellent use, in carrying their
sugars, and working in the Ingenio; but they had got none when I was
there, but they were making trialls, either to get some of those, or
some large Horse Assinigoes, to breed with the Mares of that Coun∣try.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hogges.</NOTE> We have here in abundance, but not wild or loose, for if they were
they would do more harme then their bodies are worth; they are
enclos'd, and every man knows his own, those that reare them to sell,
do commonly sell them for a groat a pound; weighing them alive;
sometimes six pence if flesh be deere. There was a Planter in the
Iland, that came to his neighbour and said to him: Neighbour I hear
you have lately bought good store of servants, out of the last ship that
came from England, and I heare withall, that you want provisions,
I have great want of a woman servant; and would be glad to make an
exchange; If you will let me have some of your womans flesh, you shall
have some of my hoggs flesh; so the price was set a groat a pound for
the hogges flesh, and sixe pence for the Womans flesh. The scales
were set up, and the Planter had a Maid that was extreame fat, lasie,
and good for nothing▪ Her name was <HI>Honor;</HI> The man brought a
great fat sow, and put it in one scale: and <HI>Honor</HI> was put in the other,
but when he saw how much the Maid outwayed his Sow: he broke
off the bargaine, and would not go on: though such a case as this, may
seldome happen, yet 'tis an ordinary thing there, to sell their servants
to one another for the time they have to serve; and in exchange, re∣ceive
any commodities that are in the Iland; I have said as much al∣ready
of the largeness weight and goodnesse of these hogs as is needful,
and therefore I shall need no more.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sheepe▪</NOTE> We have here, but very few; and those do not like well the pasture,
being very unfit for them; a soure tough and saplesse grasse, and some
poysonous plant they find, which breeds diseases amongst them, and
so they dye away, they never are fat, and we thought a while the rea∣son
had been, their too much heate with their wool, and so got them
often sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne; but that would not cure them, yet the Ews bear alwayes
two Lambs, their flesh when we tried any of them, had a very faint
taste, so that I do not think they are fit to be bred or kept in that
Countrey: other sheep we have there, which are brought from <HI>Guinny</HI>
and <HI>Binny,</HI> and those have haire growing on them, instead of wool; and
liker Goates then sheep, yet their flesh is tasted more like mutton
then the other.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Goates.</NOTE> We have in greater plenty, and they prosper farre better then the
sheep, and I find little difference in the taste of their flesh, and the
Goats here; they live for the most part in the woods, sometimes in
the pasture, but are alwaies inclos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in a fence, that they do not trespass
upon their neighbours ground; for whosoever finds Hog or Goat of
his neighbours, either in his Canes, Corne, Potatoes, Bonavist, or Plan∣tines,
may by the lawes of the Iland shoot him through with a Gun,
and kill him; but then he must presently send to the owner, to let him
know where he is.</P>
<PB N="60" REF="38"/>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Birds.</NOTE> 
The Birds of this place (setting two aside) are hardly worth the
pains of describing;yet, in order, as I did the Beasts, I will set them
down. The biggest is a direct Bussard, but somewhat lesse then our
grey Bussards in <HI>England,</HI> somewhat swifter of wing; and the only
good they do, is, sometimes to kill the Rats. The next to him in big∣nesse,
is the larger Turtle Dove, and of them, there is great store in
the Iland: 'tis a much handsomer bird, both in shape and colour, then
ours in <HI>England,</HI> and is very good meat. Next to her is the lesser
Turtle, a far finer bird then she, but of a contrary shape; for this is of
the shape of a Partridge, but her plumidge gray, and a red brown
under the wings; a pretier bird I do not know, of so few glorious co∣lours;
her tune like the other. The next is a bird like a Thrush, of a
melancholly look, her feathers never smooth, but alwaies ruffled, as
if she were muing, her head down, her shoulders up, as if her neck
were broke. This bird has for three or four notes, the loudest and
sweetest, that ever I heard; if she had variety, certainly no
bird could go beyond her; she lookes alwaies, as if she were sick or
melancholly.</P>
<P>Another there is, not much unlike a Wren, but big as a Thrush; and
this is a merry and jolly, as the other is sad; and as she sits on a stick,
jets, and lifts up her train, looking with so earnest and merry a coun∣tenance,
as if she would invite you to come to her, and will sit till
you come very neer her. This bird I never heard sing. The nex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Black-bird, with white eyes, and that so ill becomes her, as she is ac∣counted
an unhandsome bird; her voice harsh, somewhat like our
Jay in <HI>England;</HI> they go in great flocks, and are harmefull birds, for
they are great devourers of corn, and blossomes of trees, and the Plan∣ters
wish them destroyed, though they know not which way. They
are a kinde of Stares, for they walk, and do not hop as other birds.
One thing I observe in these birds, which I never saw in any but
them, and that is, when they flie, they put their train into severall po∣stures;
one while they keep it straight, as other birds; sometimes they
turn it edge-waies, as the tail of a fish, and by and by put it three
square, with the covering feather a top, and the sides downwards.
The next is of the colour of a Feldefare, but the head seemes too big
for her body, and for that reason they call her a Counsellor; her fly∣ing
is extream wanton; and for her tune, 'tis such as I have not heard
any like her, not for the sweetnesse, but the strangenesse of it; for she
performes that with her voice, that no instrument can play, nor no
voice sing, but hers; and that is, quarter notes, her song being com∣posed
of five tones, and every one a quarter of a note higher then
other. Mr. <HI>John Coprario,</HI> a rare composer of Musick, and my dear
friend, told me once, that he was studying a curiosity in musick, that
no man had ever attempted to do; and that was, of quarter notes;
but he not being able to go through with it, gave it over: But if he
had liv'd to have gone with me to the <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> this bird should have
taught him. Under this size, there are none considerable; Sparrowes,
Haysocks, Finches, yellow Hamers, Titnies, and divers others of that
sort, for which I have no names. But the last and strangest of all, is,
that which we call the huming Bird, much lesse then a Wren, not
<PB N="61" REF="38"/>
much bigger then a humble Bee, her body long, her wings small and
sharp, of a sullen sad green, no pleasant colours on her; her manner of
feeding is, just as a Bee, putting her bill into a blossome or a flower,
tastes as lightly as a Bee, never sitting, but purring with her wings, all
the time she staies with the flower; and the motion of her wings are as
nimble and swift, as a Bee: We have no way to take her, but by shoo∣ting
sand out of a gun at her, which mazes her for the present, that
you may take her up; but there is no way to keep her alive, her feeding
being such, as none can give her but her selfe. Now for the Birds
that live upon the outward verge of the Iland, I have not much to
say. Sometimes Teals come to our Ponds, three or four couple toge∣ther,
but never go away; for when we see them, we take a gun, and
comming neer, shoot them, and the report of the gun frights, and
makes those that are alive flie away, and fetch one turn, and come
back to see their fellowes dead, and alight to them, and so we shoot
and shoot again till all be kill'd; for they will alwaies come back to
see their dead friends. The like we do with those birds we call Oxen
and Kine, which come to us in like manner. Small Swallowes we have
now and then, but somewhat different from ours in colour.</P>
<P>But there is a Bird they call, a Man of war, and he is much bigger
than a Heron, and flies out to Sea upon discoveries, (for they never
light upon the Sea) to see what ships are comming to the Iland; and
when they return, the Ilanders look out, and say, A ship is comming,
and finde it true. I have seen one of them, as high as I could look, to
meet us twenty leagues from land; and some others, almost as big as
Ducks, that in an evening came in a flock of twenty, or there about,
and they made divers turnes about the ship, a little before Sun-set∣ting;
and when it grew dark, they lighted upon the ribs of the ship,
and with little nooses of packthred, the saylers caught them; they
were very fat and good.</P>
<P>Though the Bat be no Bird, yet she flies with wings, and alwaies a
little before Sunsetting, at which time they come out of holes, chim∣neys,
and hollow trees, and will raise them to a great height, feeding
themselves with flies that they finde in the aire, at that time of the
evening.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of lesser A∣nimals and Insects.</NOTE> Having done with Beasts and Birds, we will enquire what other
lesser Animalls or Insects there are upon the Iland, of which, Snakes
are the chiefe, because the largest; and I have seen some of those a yard
and a halfe long. The only harme they do, is to our Pigeon houses, and
milk-panns; so that if we leave any hole in the bottom of the house,
where they can come in, they will get to the nests, and devour the
young Pigeons, if they be not over big. And yet 'tis strange to see,
what great morsells they will swallow; slide they will up against a
wall, if it be but perpendicular; but if it be declining outward, they
cannot get up, but will fall back ten foot high, if they be hindred by
any stooping of the wall; for which reason we make jetties, neer the
top of such roomes, as we will keep them out of; they have climbed
six foot high upon the outside of a wall, come in at a window, down
on the inside, skim our milk-pannes, and away again: Till we took
one of them there, we knew not by what means our pannes were thus
<PB N="62" REF="39"/>
skim'd. They never sting any body, nor is there any venomous beast
in the Iland. The next to these are Scorpions, of which, some of them
are as big as Ratts, smooth, aud coloured like a Snake, somewhat
blewer, their bellies inclining to yellow, very nimble and quick to
avoid their pursuers: yet, the Snakes will now and then take
them, between whom there is a great conflict, before the quarrell be
decided; for, the Scorpions that are large, are very strong, and will
maintain the fight sometimes halfe an houre; I have seen them wrastle
together a good part of that time: But in conclusion, the Snakes get
the better, and devour the other. These Scorpions were never
known to hurt man or beast. Toads or Frogs we have none.</P>
<P>Lizards we had in great plenty, but the Cats kill them so fast in the
houses, as they are much lessened in their number. This little Animal
loves much to be where men are, and are delighted to stand and gaze
in their faces, and hearken to their discourse. These with us, I think,
are different from those of <HI>Europe;</HI> the bodies of ours are about four
inches long, the tail neer as much, headed not much unlike a Snake;
their colour, when they are pleased, a pure grasse-green on the back,
blewish toward the side, and yellowish on the belly; four leggs, and
those very nimble: When they see at distance some of their own
kinde, that they are angry with▪ they swell a little bigger, and change
their colour, from green to russet or hair-colour, which abates much
of their beauty; for, their green is very plea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant and beautifull: Cold
they are as Frogs. Next to these are Cockroches, a creature of the big∣nesse
and shape of a Beetle; but of a pure hair-colour, which would
set him off the better, if he had not an ugly wabling gate, but that
makes him unhandsome. He appears in the evening when 'tis dark,
and will, when he pleases, flie to your bed, when he findes you slee∣ping,
and bite your skin, till he fetch blood, if you do not wake; and
if you take a Candle to search for him, he shifts away and hides him∣selfe,
as the Pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nices do in <HI>Italy.</HI> The Negres, who have thick skins,
and by reason of their hard labour, sleep foundly at night, are bitten
so, as far as the breadth of both your hands together, their skins are
rac't, as if it were done with a currie-comb. Next to these tormen∣tors,
are Musketos, who bite and sting worse then the Gnats and
Stouts, that sting Cattle in <HI>England,</HI> (and are commonly felt in marish
ground). And next to them Meriwings, and they are of so small a sise,
and so thin and aereall, as you can hardly discern them, but by the
noise of their wings, which is like a small bugle horn, at a great di∣stance:
Where they sting, there will rise a little knob, as big as a pease,
and last so a whole day; the mark will not be gone in twenty four
hours. Caterpillars we have sometimes in abundance, and they do
very great harme; for, they light upon the leaves of our Potatoes,
which we call Slips, and eat them all away, and come so low, as to
eat of the Root too: And the only remedy we have, is, to drive a
flock of Turkies into the place where they are, and they will devour
them. The harmes these vermine do us, is double; first, in the slips,
which is the food we give our Horses, and is cast into the rack; and
in our Potatoes, being the root of these slips, which we our selves
feed upon.</P>
<PB N="63" REF="39"/>
<P>Flies we have of so many kindes, (from two inches long with the
great hornes, which we keep in boxes, and are shewed by <HI>John
Tre∣descan</HI>
amongst his rarities) to the least Atome, as it would be a
weary work to set them down; as also the sudden production of
them, from Nothing to Maggets, from Maggets to Flies; and there
is not only a race of all these kindes, that go on in a generation, but
upon new occasions, new kindes; as, after a great downfall of rain,
when the ground has been extreamly moistned; and softned with the
water, I have walk'd out upon a drie walk (which I made my selfe)
in an evening, and there came about me an army of such flies, as I had
never seen before, nor after; and they rose, as I conceived, out of the
earth: They were as big bodied as Bees, but far larger wings; harme
they did us none, but only lighted on us; their colour between ash-colour
and purple.</P>
<P>The next of these moving little Animalls are Ants, or Pismires,
and those are but of a small sise, but great in industry; and that which
gives them means to attain to their ends, is, they have all one soul.
If I should say, they are here or there, I should do them wrong; for
they are every where, under ground, where any hollow or loose earth
is, amongst the roots of trees, upon the bodies, branches, leaves, and
fruit of all trees, in all places without the houses and within, upon
the sides, walls, windowes, and roofes without; and on the floores,
side-walls, sealings, and windowes within; tables, cupbords, beds,
stooles, all are covered with them, so that they are a kind of Ubiqui∣taries.
The Cockroaches are their mortall enemies, and though they
are not able to do them any mischiefe, being living, (by reason they
are far stronger and mightier then a hundred of them, &amp; if they should
force any one of them with multitudes, he has the liberty of his wings
to make his escape) yet, when they finde him dead, they will divide
him amongst them into Atomes; and to that purpose, they carry him
home to their houses or nests. We sometimes kill a Cockroach, and
throw him on the ground, and mark what they will do with him;
his body is bigger then a hundred of them, and yet they will finde
the means to take hold of him, and lift him up; and having him a∣bove
ground, away they carry him, and some go by as ready
assistants, if any be weary; and some are the Officers that lead and
shew the way to the hole into which he must passe; and if the Van
curriers perceive, that the body of the Cockroach lies crosse, and
will not passe through the hole, or arch, through which they mean
to carry him, order is given, and the body turned endwise, and
this done a foot before they come to the hole, and that without any
stop or stay; and this is observable, that they never pull contrary
waies.</P>
<P>Those that are curious, and will prevent their comming on their
Tables, Cupbords, or Beds, have little hollowes of timber, fill'd with
water, for the feet of these to stand in; but all this will not serve their
turne; for they will some of them, goe up to the sieling, and let
themselves fall upon the teasters of the Beds, Cupbords, and
Tables.</P>
<P>To prevent them from comming on our shelves where our meat
<PB N="64" REF="40"/>
is kept, we hang them to the roofe by ropes, and tarre those
roapes, and the roofes over them, as also the strings of our
Hamacks, for which reason we avoid them better in Hamacks then
in beds.</P>
<P>Sometimes when we try conclusions upon them; we take the Car∣pet
off the Table, and shake it, so that all the Ants drop off, and rub
down the leggs and feet of those tables, (which stood not in water)
and having done so: we lay on the Carpet againe, and set upon it a
Sallet dish, or Trencher, with suger in it, which some of them in the
room will presently smell, and make towards it as fast as they can,
which is a long journey; for he must begin at the foot of the table, and
come as high as the inside of the Carpet, and so go down to the bot∣tome
and up of the outside of the Carpet, before he gets on the table,
and then to the sugar, which he smels to; and having found it, returnes
againe the same way, without taking any for his paines, and enformes
all his friends of this bootie; who come in thousands, and tenne thou∣sands,
and in an instant, fetch it all away; and when they are thickest
upon the table, clap a large book, (or any thing fit for that purpose)
upon them, so hard as to kill all that are under it, and when you have
done so, take away the book, and leave them to themselves, but a
quarter of an houre, and when you come againe, you shall find all
those bodies carried away. Other trials we make of their Ingenuity,
as this. Take a Pewter dish, and fill it halfe full of water, into which
put a little Gally pot fill'd with Sugar, and the Ants will presently find
it, and come upon the Table; but when they perceive it inviron'd with
water, they try about the brims of the dish, where the Gally pot is
neerest, and there the most venturous amongst them, commits him
selfe to the water, though he be conscious how ill a swimmer he is, and
is drown'd in the adventure: the next is not warn'd by his example,
but ventures too; and is alike drown'd: and many more, so that there
is a small foundation of their bodies to venture on; and then they
come faster then ever, and so make a bridge of their own bodies, for
their friends to passe on; neglecting their lives for the good of the
publique; for before they make an end, they will make way for the
rest, and become Masters of the Prize; I had a little white sugar which
I desired to keep from them, and was devising which way to doe it,
and I knockt a Nayle in the beam of the roome, and fastned to it a
brown thread, at the lower end of which thread, I tyed a large shell of
a fish; which being hollow I put the sugar in; and lockt the door,
thinking it safe; but when I returned, I found three quarters of my
sugar gone, and the Ants in abundance, ascending and descending,
like the Angels on Jacobs Ladder, as I have seen it painted, so that I
found no place safe, from these more then busie Creatures.</P>
<P>Another sorts of Ants there are, but nothing so numerous or harm∣full
as the other, but larger by farre; these build great nests, as bigge as
Bee hives, against a wall, or a tree, of Clay and Lome, sometimes within
doors, and in it severall little Mansions, such as Bees make for them∣selves,
but nothing so curious; these the Cockroaches and Lizards
meet withall, way-laying them neere their nests, and feed up∣on
them: which to prevent they make from thence, many and severall
<PB N="65" REF="40"/>
galleries that reach some of them sixe or seaven yards severall waies,
of the same earth they doe their nests; so that for such a distance as
that, they are not to be perceiv'd, by any of their enemies, and com∣monly,
their Avenues go out amongst leaves, or mosse, or some other
Covert, that they may not be perceiv'd; but the most of these are in
the woods; for we have destroyed their nests, and their galleries with∣in
doors so often, as they are weary of building, and so quit the house,
I can say nothing of these, but that they are the quickest at their work
of building, of any little Creatures that ever I saw. Spiders we
have, the beautifullest and largest that I have seen, and the most
curious in their webs; they are not at all Poysonous.</P>
<P>One sort more of these harmefull Animals there are, which we call
Chegoes; and these are so little that you would hardly think them
able to doe any harme at all, and yet these will do more mischiefe
then the Ants, and if they were as numerous as harmefull, there were
no induring of them; they are of a shape, not much unlike a Louse,
but no bigger then a mite that breeds in cheese, his colour blewish:
an Indian has laid one of them, on a sheet of white paper, and with
my spectacles on I could hardly discern him; yet this very little Ene∣my,
can and will do much mischiefe to mankind. This vermine will
get thorough your Stocken, and in a pore of your skinne, in some part
of your feet, commonly under the nayl of your toes, and there make a
habitation to lay his off spring, as bigge as a small Tare, or the bagge
of a Bee, which will cause you to go very lame, and put you to much
smarting paine. The Indian women have the best skill to take them
out, which they do by putting in, a small poynted Pinn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, or Needle,
at the hole where he came in, and winding the poynt about the bagge
loosen him from the flesh, and so take him out. He is of a blewish
colour, and is seene through the skinne, but the <HI>Negroes</HI> whose
skinns are of that colour (or neer it) are in ill case, for they cannot
finde where they are; by which meanes they are many of them very
lame: some of these Chegoes are poysonous, and after they are taken
out, the Orifice in which they lay, will fester and rankle for a fortnight
after they are gone. I have had tenne taken out of my feet in a mor∣ning,
by the most unfortunate <HI>Yarico</HI> an Indian woman.</P>
<P>Some kind of Animals more there are in the woods, which because
I never saw I cannot speak their formes: some of them I guesse are
no bigger than Crickets; they lye all day in holes and hollow trees,
and as soon as the Sun is downe, they begin their tunes, which are
neither singing nor crying, but the shrillest voyces that ever I heard:
nothing can be so neerely resembl'd to it, as the mouths of a pack
of small beagles at a distance; and so lively, and chirping the noyse is,
as nothing can be more delightfull to the eares, if there were not too
much of it, for the musick hath no intermission till morning, and then
all is husht.</P>
<P>I had forgotten amongst my fishes to mention Crabs; but because
this kind of them live upon the land, I might very well overslip them
and now bring them in, amongst these Animals: they are small Crabs,
such as women sell by dozens in baskets in the streets, and of that
colour raw and alive, as these are boyl'd, which is of a reddish colour.
<PB N="66" REF="41"/>
These Crabs are comming from the Sea all the year long, (except in
<HI>March)</HI> they hide themselves in holes, and in houses, and sometimes
in hollow trees; and into every part of the Iland they come, some∣times
we meet them going up stairs in the night, sometimes in our
low rooms, sometimes in our Gardens, where they eat the berbs.
We hold them not good meat: But the Negres will often upon Sun∣daies
go a Crabbing, and think them very great dainties when they
are boyled. These Crabs in <HI>March</HI> come all out of their holes, and
march down towards the Sea in such multitudes, as to cover a great
part of the ground where they go, and no hedge, wall, or house can
stop them, but they will over. As we ride, our Horses tread on them,
they are so thick on the ground. And they have this sense, to go the
nearest way to the Sea, from the place where they are, and nothing
can stop or stay them, but death. 'Tis the time I guesse they go to
breed.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trees.</NOTE> Having past through all the reasonable and sensitives Creatures of
this Iland,I come now to say somewhat of the Vegetables, as of
Trees: and of those there are such infinite varieties, as to mention all,
were to loose my selfe in a wood; for, it were impossible for any one
in the time I stayed there, (though he studied nothing else) to give
an account of the particulars. And therefore I will onely mention
such, as for beauty or use, are of most and greatest esteem in the
Iland.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Physick-Nut.</NOTE> And for that there is none of more use than the <HI>Physick-Nut,</HI> I will
begin first with that, which though the name seem to promise health,
yet, it has poyson lodg'd secretly within, and that poyson may bring
health, being physically applyed, and in fit times and seasons. The
reason why I think it poysonous, is, because Cattle will not brouse,
nor feed on the leaves, nor willingly come neer the shade. This tree
will grow to be eighteen foot high, but we have a way to employ it;
as for beauty and use, there are none such in the Iland. This tree <HI>(which
is of the height as I have told you)</HI> has many springs, of four, five, and six
foot long; we lop them one after another, and as we take off the bran∣ches,
cut stakes of them, about foure foot and a halfe long, and stick
them in the ground an inch deep, and no more, close to one another
in the manner of Paliffadoes; and so, with a rail of either side, to keep
them eeven, and here and there a spur or braket on either side, to
keep them steedy for a month; by which time, they will not only ga∣ther
roots to strengthen them, and hold them up, but leaves to cover
their tops, and so even and smooth they fall, as to cover the tops of
themselves, at least two foot and a halfe downward: and will in a
month more, be so firmly rooted in the earth, as you may remove
your railes and brakets, to assist those that are planted after them, in
other places. These leaves being large, smooth, and beautifully shap't,
and of a full green, appear to your eyes like so much green Satin,
hang'd on a rail or line, so eeven and so smooth they hang natu∣rally.</P>
<P>The stems will grow apace, but more in their bignesse then their
height, (for you may if you please, keep them at this height, by cut∣ting
off the tops) and in a while they will not only touch, but imbody
<PB N="67" REF="41"/>
themselves one into another; and then they become as strong and
usefull a fence, as any can be made, so close, as to keep in Conies,
and keep out Rats; for, neither Cattle nor Vermine love to come neer
it. And as it is a beautifull and usefull fence, for Gardens and Or∣chards,
and to keep in Conies, Turkies, <HI>Muscovia</HI> Ducks, and Dung-hill
foul, that cannot flie over, (having one wing clipt) so it serves
us for singular use, in fencing about all our Pastures, or what other
ground we would enclose: For, our fences being all made of faln
trees, with the ends laid crosse one upon another, and many of those
trees such wood, as were apt to rot and decay, by extream moisture,
and violent heat; and the Planters having found the most of them
were rotten and decayed, and to make new fences of that kind im∣possible,
by reason the timbers and trees that grew very neer that
place, were imployed in making those fences, (for as they made them,
the timber stood in their way, and no more adoe but cut them down,
and lay them in their places without further removing) and removes
of so great trees as they were, not to be done with few and weak
hands: So that they were come to a great strait, and knew not which
way, nor how, to renew these fences; some of the Pastures having no
lesse then three thousand two hundred sixty eight trees to encompasse
them. At last, they thought upon this way, of making new fences,
which is the most commodious that can be imagined. And so they
gather'd all the Physick-nuts they could, and sowed them, and made
large Nurseries of them, which as soon as they grew to any strength,
they remov'd, and planted them so, as making a sleight hedge be∣tween
the old fence and the Pasture, that Cattle might not tread
them down, being young and tender, they planted them between;
and in four years time they grew so strong, as they were of sufficient
ability to defend themselves, and became a very sufficient fence to
keep in or out the strongest Bulls in the Pasture. And then, all the
wood of the old fence being drie, and fit for the Furnaces, was cut in
short pieces, cleft, and sent home by the Assinigos; and part was ga∣thered
together, and made into Charcoals, for fewell at home, and
for the Smiths Forge, for we have there no Sea-coales. Besides this,
there is another use of this Plant, and that is Physicall: Take five of
the kernells, and eat them in a morning fasting, and they are a Vomit
and Purge; but the body must be strong that takes so many: three
will serve a body that is easie to work on: I my selfe took five of
them, and they gave me twelve vomits, and above twenty stooles,
which was too great an evacuation in a hot Country, where the body
is weak, and the spirits exhausted by continuall sweating.</P>
<P>But I saw a stronger man there take them before me, and they
wrought moderately with him; but, finding a weaker constitution to
work on, they had the more powerfull operation.</P>
<P>This Nut, as it growes on the tree, is like a white Pear-plumb, and
of a yellowish colour, with a pulpe on it, as much as a Plumb; but
that being taken off, there remains a stone, of a blackish colour, and
within that, a kernell, and in that kernell, in the parting it in two
halves, as our Hazle nuts in <HI>England,</HI> will part in the middle long∣wise,
you shall finde a thin filme, which lookes of a faint Carnation,
<PB N="68" REF="42"/>
which colour is easily discerned, the rest of the kernell being so per∣fectly
white; Take out that filme, and you may eat the nut safely,
without any operation at all, and 'tis as sweet, as a <HI>Jordan</HI>-Almond.
This filme is perfectly discern'd, when the nut is new gathered; but
I have look'd on them which have been longer kept, after I brought
them into <HI>England,</HI> and I finde the Carnation colour quite gone, but the
kernell retaines still his operation, both in Vomit and Purge.</P>
<P>The leaves are shap'd not much unlike a Vine leafe, but thrice as
big, and much thicker, and fuller green.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Poyson tree.</NOTE> The poysoned tree, though I cannot commend for her vertues,
yet for her beauties I can. She is almost as large every way as the Lo∣cust,
but not of that manner of growing; her leaves full out as large
and beautifull, as the Lawrells, and so like, as not to be known assun∣der.
The people that have lived long there, say, 'tis not wholsome
to be under the shade of this tree. The fellers, as they cut them down,
are very carefull of their eyes; and those that have Cipers, put it o∣ver
their faces; for if any of the sap flie into their eyes, they become
blinde for a month. A Negre had two Horses to walke, which were
left with him by two Gentlemen; and the Horses beginning to fight,
the Negre was afeard, and let them go; and they running into the
wood together, struck at one another, and their heeles hitting some
young trees of this kind, struck the poysonous juice into one ano∣thers
eyes, and so their blindnesse parted the fray, and they were both
led home stone blind, and continued so a month, all the hair and skin
pilling off their faces. Yet, of this timber we make all, or the most
part, of the Pots we cure our Sugar in; for, being sawed, and the boards
dried in the Sun, the poyson vapours out.</P>
<P>And as this tree's poyson is in her sap, so the Mantionell's is in her
fruit, which they account as high a poyson, as that of the Cassavie.
The fruit is like an apple <HI>John,</HI> and 'tis said to be one of those poysons,
wherewith the Indian Caniballs invenome their Arrowes.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cassavie.</NOTE> And now I have nam'd the Cassavie, 'tis fit it come in the rank of
poysons, though with good ordering it makes bread. 'Tis rather a
shrub then a tree, the sprigs, few of them bigger then a broom-staffe,
crooked and ill shap'd; but no matter for that, for the leaves are so
thick, as to cover them; and they grow in tufts or bunches, and ever
an odd one, as, 5. 7. 9. or 11. every leafe an inch broad, and six or se∣ven
inches long; dark green, and turning backward from the foreside.
Their Roots I have set down already, their bignesse, and manner of
growth, with the use of them.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coloquinti∣da.</NOTE> Coloquintida is as beautifull a fruit, as any you can see, of the big∣nesse
of an Ostrages egge; a fruit of so ill a taste, as a spoonfull of the
liquor mars a whole pot of pottage; the rinde smooth, with various
greens, interlac'd with murries, yellowes, and faint carnations.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cassia-fistu∣la.</NOTE> Next to this shall be the Cassia fistula, which is a tree that will grow
the most, in the least time, of any that ever I knew: I set one of the
seeds, (which is but a small seed) and in a yeers time, it grew to be
eight foot high, and as large and big in the stem, as an ordinary Rat∣toon
you walk withall: The leaf of this tree is like that of an Ash, but
much longer, and of a darker colour; the fruit, when 'tis ripe, just of
<PB N="69" REF="42"/>
the colour of a black pudding, and shap'd as like, but longer. I have
seen of them above 16 inches long; the pulp of it is purgative, and a
great cooler of the reins.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">The poyso∣ned Cane.</NOTE> Now because we will have all, or as many of the poysonous and
Physicall trees and plants together as we can, that they may not trou∣ble
another leafe, we will put in a plant amongst the trees, and that is
so like a sugar Cane as hardly to be discern'd, the one from the other:
and this Plant hath this quality, that whosoever chews it, and sucks
in any of the juyce, will have his tongue, mouth, and throat, so swell'd
as to take away the faculty of speech for two dayes, and no remedy
that I know but patience.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tamarine.</NOTE> Tamarine trees were but newly planted in the Iland, at the time I
came away, and the Palme tree (so much admir'd for her two rare
vertues of Oyle and Wine) was newly begun to be planted, the plant
being brought us from the <HI>East Indies,</HI> but the Wine she brings
may rather be called a pleasant drink, then to assume the name of
Wine: 'tis thus gather'd, they cut the bark in such a part of the tree,
where a bottle may fitly be plac't, and the liquor being received into
this bottle, it wil keep very good for a day and no longer but is a very
delicious kind of liquor.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruit trees.</NOTE> The poysonous trees and plants being past over: 'tis now fit to
mention such as will make amends, and put our mouths in taste, but
not too suddenly to fall upon the best, I will begin with the most
contemptible fruits which are in the Iland, the Fig tree and Cherry-tree,
which have savory names, but in their natures neither usefull,
nor well tasted. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Figge tree.</NOTE> The Fig tree being very large, but beares a small
fruit, and those of so meane a condition, as I never saw any one eate of
them, and the leaves not at all of the shape of our Fig leaves, nor the
fifth part so large, the body of the tree I have seen as large as; an
ordinary Elme here in England.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cherry tree.</NOTE> The Cherry tree is not altogether so large, the fruit as useless and
insipid: but the colour something resembling a Cherry, and the shape
not much unlike; which caused the planters to call it by that
name.</P>
<P>The next to these shall be fruites, rather for sauce then meat, to whet
our appetites to those that follow after; and these are the Citrons, O∣ranges,
Lymons, Lyme.</P>
<P>The Citron is a small tree, though she beare a great fruit; and so ill
matcht they are, as the fruit pulls it down to the ground, and most of
the fruit touches, and beares upon the ground; the stalk of a dark co∣lour,
the leafe shap't like that of the Limon, but of a very dark green:
these fruits we had in great abundance, when first we came there, but
were all cast away, by reason we had none but Muscavado suger, and
that is not fit to preserve with; besides there were very few then that
had the skill to do them.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Orange.</NOTE> The Orange trees do not prosper here, nor are the fruits so kindly
as those of <HI>Bern udos:</HI> large they are and full of juice, but not so delici∣ous
as those of that Iland; besides they are very full of seeds, and their
rinds neither so deep, and pure an Orange Tawny, nor so thick, and
therefore not so fit to preserve: the trees seldome last above seven years
in their prime, and then decay.</P>
<PB N="70" REF="43"/>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Limon.</NOTE> The Limon tree is much better shap't and larger, but this fruit is
but here and there, stragling in the Iland. I have seen some of the
fruit large, and very full of juice, with a fragrant smell: the leaves both
of these and the Orange trees, I shall not need to mention being so
well known in England.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lime-tree.</NOTE> The Lime tree is like a thick Hollybush in England, and as full of
prickles: if you make a hedge of them, about your house, 'tis sufficient
proofe against the <HI>Negres;</HI> whose naked bodies cannot possible enter
it, and it is an extraordinary sure fence against Cattell; it commonly
growes seven or eight foot high, extreamly thick of leaves and fruit,
and of prickles; the leaves not unlike those of a Limon tree, the fruit
so like as not to be discerned, at the distance of three yeards, but on∣ly
that 'tis less, but in the taste of the rinde and juice, extreamly diffe∣rent,
much fitter for sauce then the Limon, but not so good to eate
alone.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prickled ap∣ple.</NOTE> The Prickled apple, growes on a tree extreamly thick leav'd, and
those leaves large, and of a deep green, shap't not much unlike the
leafe of a Wallnut tree in England: this fruit is shap't like the heart
of an Oxe, and much about that bigness; a faint green on the outside,
with many prickles on it, the tast very like a musty Limon.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prickled Peare.</NOTE> The next in order, shall be the Prickled peare, much purer in taste
and better form'd; the fruit being not unlike in shape to a Greenfield-peare,
and of a faint green, intermixt with some yellow neare the stalk;
but the body of a mixt red, partly Crimson, partly Stammell, with
prickled spots of yellow, the end of it growing somewhat
larger then the middle, at which end, is a round spot of a murrey co∣lour,
the bredth of an inch, and circular with a Centre in the middle,
and a small circle about it, and from that circle within, lines drawn to
the utmost <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of that round Murrey spot, with faint circles
betweene the small circle and the largest, upon that Murrey
spot.</P>
<P>These lines and circles, of a colour no more different in light∣nesse
from the murry, then only to be discerned, and a little yellower
colour.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pomegra∣nate.</NOTE> The Pomegranate is a beautifull tree the leaves small, with a green
mixt with Olive colour, the blossome large, well shap't, and of a pure
Scarlet colour; the fruit not so large there, as those we have from
Spaine. The young trees being set in rowes, and planted thick
make a very good hedge, being clipt eeven a top with Garden shears.
The fruit is very well known to you and therefore I shall need say
nothing of that, and these are all the remarkable fruits that grow on
trees, and are proper to this Iland, that I can remember, though I
believe there are many more.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Papa.</NOTE> The Papa is but a small tree, her bark of a faint willow colour, her
leaves large, and of the shape of the Physick nut tree, but of the colour
of her own bark, the branches grow out four or five of one height, and
spread almost levell from the place where they bud out; to the ends
of the branches, and about two foot higher, such other branches sprea∣ding
in the same manner, and if the tree grow to a greater height then
ordinary, a story or two more of these bowes: the top handsomely

form'd to the branches, the fruit somewhat bigger then Turnips,
growing close to the body of the tree, where the branches grow, and
are somewhat a fainter Willow, then either the body, branches, or
leaves. The tree, though it may be accounted wood, yet the softest
that yet I ever saw; for, with my knife, I can cut down a tree as big
as a mans leg at one chop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ The fruit we boyl, and serve it up with
powdred pork, as we do turnips in <HI>England;</HI> but the turnip is far the
more savoury fruit.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gnaver.</NOTE> The Gnaver growes on a Tree, bodied and leav'd like a Cherry-tree,
but the leaves somewhat larger and stiffer; the fruit of the big∣nesse
of a small Limon, and neer that colour, onely the upper end
somewhat blunter then the Limon; the rinde about the thicknesse of
the rinde of a Limon, but soft, and of a delicate taste; it holds within
a pulpie substance, full of small seeds, like a fig, some of them white
within, and some of a stammell colour. These seeds have this property,
that when they have past through the body, wheresoever they are laid
down, they grow. A Planter, &amp; an eminent man in the Iland, seeing his
Daughter by chance about her naturall businesse, call'd to her: <HI>Plant
even, Daughter, plant even.</HI> She answered: <HI>If you do not like 'em, remove 'em,
Father, remove 'em.</HI> These fruites have different tastes, some rank, some
sweet; so that one would give a reason of this variety, which was, ac∣cording
to the severall constitutions they had past through, some ha∣ving
a milder, some a stronger savour.</P>
<P>This tree doth much harm in our Plantations; for the Cattle eating
of them, let fall their loads every where, and so they grow in abur∣dance,
and do much harm to the Pastures, and much pains and labour
is taken to destroy them. They are the best fruites preserv'd of any,
the seeds being taken out, and the rinde only preserved.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Coco.</NOTE> I have been told by some Planters in the Iland, that Coco-trees
grow there,and they are such men as I give credit to, but I never saw
any; yet, I may venture to tell what shapes they bear, having been
well acquainted with them at the Iland of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> where there grew
very many of them. They seldome are above 80. or 90 foot high,
some a 100. The branches of these come out in severall parts of the
tree, leaving spaces between the heights; but the greatest quantity is
at top, and that top alwaies stoops a little; but the Nuts grow where
the lower boughes break out.</P>
<P>These Nuts are of severall sises, the most of them as big as a large
foot-ball, with a green skin without, and between that and the shell,
a pulpy substance, which when it is drie, is like the rinde of the Man∣grave
tree, of which they make roaps, or (to bring the resemblance
a little neerer) like hemp kurds. This Nut-shell is neer half an inch
thick, which we commonly cut at one end, a hole as big as a thirty
shilling piece, and we finde the shell full of a clear and pure tasted li∣quor,
very delicious, but not very wholsome. This shell is li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d
within with a substance as thick as it selfe, a white colour, and tastes
sweeter then the best french Walnut, and of that softnesse. The co∣lour
of the leaves of this tree, are like the Olive leaves.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Custard-Apple.</NOTE> The Custard apple growes on a tree full of branches and large
leaves,and is a lively and lusty tree to look on; the fruit, when 'tis
<PB N="72" REF="45"/>
ripe, as big as the largest Pomewater, but just of the colour of a War∣den.
When 'tis ripe, we gather it, and keep it one day, and then it is
fit to be eaten. We cut a hole at the lesser end, (that it may stand the
firmer in the dish) so big, as that a spoon may go in with ease, and
with the spoon eat it. Never was excellent Custard more like it selfe,
then this to it; only this addition, which make it transcend all Cu∣stards
that art can make, though of naturall ingredients; and that is,
a fruity taste, which makes it strange and admirable. Many seeds there
are in it, but so smooth, as you may put them out of your mouth with
some pleasure.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Anchovie-Pear.</NOTE> 'Twas never my luck to see any of those trees, that bear the Ancho∣vie-Pears,
nor to taste of the fruit,and therefore can give you no ac∣count
of that tree; only to let you know, that there is such a tree in
the Iland.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trees of mixt kinds.</NOTE> The Macow is one of the strangest trees, the Iland affords; the
body and branches being stuck all over with prickles, of the finest
formes that I have seen.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Macow.</NOTE> They are black as jet, or Ebony polish'd; the sises, from one to se∣ven
inches long, sharp at the point, with proportionable increasings,
from that part where it growes to the tree or bough, and wav'd, as I
have seen some swords, from the point to the hilts, the finest naturall
pick tooths that can grow. I brought a large bundle with me, but had
them pickt out of my Box by the way. This tree is about the large∣nesse
of an ordinary Willow, the leaves of that colour and shape, but
extreamly stiffe and hard.</P>
<P>It bears at top a large tuffe of fruit, which we call Apples, but they
are not a fruit to be eaten; their colour as their leaves, willow-green,
and just such for shape as the Cyprus tree bears. Sure, Nature found
this tree to some great purpose, she is so arm'd; for neither man nor
beast can touch her, without being wounded. She is well shap'd, her
body straight, her branches well proportion'd, her top round.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Date tree.</NOTE> Next to this in colour are Date-trees, but the leaves somewhat lon∣ger.
The shape of this tree I cannot give you, having never seen any
old enough to bear the name of a tree, but sprigs rising from the root,
at least ten foot high.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mangrave.</NOTE> The Mangrave is a tree of such note, as she must not be forgotten;
for, though she be not of the tall and lusty sort of trees, yet, she is of
great extent; for, there drops from her limbs a kinde of Gum, which
hangs together one drop after another, till it touch the ground, and
then takes root, and makes an addition to the tree. So that if all these
may be said to be one and the same tree▪ we may say, that a Man∣grave
tree may very well hide a troop of Horse. The bark of this tree
being well ordered, will make very strong roaps, and the Indians
make it as fine as flax, and spin it into fine thred, whereof they make
Hamocks, and divers other things they wear: and I have heard, the
linnen they wear is made of this bark, as also their chaires and
stooles.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calibash.</NOTE> The Calibash tree bears leaves of the fullest and richest green, of
any that I know, and the greatest plenty of leaves; her fruit not for
food, it is for the most part as big as that of the Coco, round as a ball,
<PB N="73" REF="45"/>
green as the leaves of the same tree, smooth and shining, and their
manner of growing is so close to the body, and the largest of the
boughes, as to touch them so, that till it be pull'd or cut off, we can∣not
perceive any stalk it has. Of this round ball, we make dishes,
bowls and caps; for, being hollow within, as the Coco-nut, we em∣ploy
them for severall uses, as they are of different sises; some for di∣shes,
some for cups, some for basons, and some of the largest to carry
water in, as we do Goards, with handles a top, as that of a kettle, for
they are smoother, and much stronger then they. These look very
beautifully on the tree, and to me the more beautifull, by how much
they were the more strange; for, by their firm and close touching the
trees, without any appearance of stalks, they seem to cleave, rather
then grow to the trees.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bay tree.</NOTE> One, and but one tree in this Iland have I seen, that bears an Eng∣lish
name, and that is the Bay tree, whose leaves are so aromatick, as
three or four of them will amply supply the place of Cloves, Mace,
and Cinamon, in dressing any dish of meat where that is required. It
differs nothing in shape or colour from ours in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Timber trees.</NOTE> The Cedar is without question the most usefull timber in the
Iland;for being strong, lasting, and not very heavy, 'tis good for buil∣ding;
but by reason of the smoothnesse and fairnesse of the grain, there
is much of it us'd in Wainscots, Chairs, Stooles, and other Utensils
within dores; but, as they grow, I never saw any of them beautifully
shap'd, the leaves just like those of the Ash in <HI>England,</HI> but somewhat
bigger.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mastick.</NOTE> The Mastick is a tree very tall, but the body slender, and therefore
Nature hath provided means to support her; for, she has spurs or
brackets above seven foot from the ground, which are fixt or en∣grafted
in the body; and some of the spurs reach out from the tree
to the root, so broad, as that tables have been made of a round form,
above three foot and a halfe diameter. Some trees have two, some
three of these spurrs. This tree has commonly a double top, one side
being somewhat higher then the other. The fruit is like none of the
rest, 'tis of a stammell colour, and has neither skin nor stone; but it is
more like a Cancre then a Fruit, and is accounted unwholsom, and
therefore no man tastes it: 'tis, I believe, the seed of the tree, for we
see none other. The leaves of this tree grow of such a height, as till
they fall down, we can give no judgment of them. The timber of
of this tree is rank'd amongst the fourth sort, three being better then
it. I have seen the bodies of these trees neer sixty foot high.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bully.</NOTE> The Bully tree is lesse then the Mastick, and bears a fruit like a Bul∣lis
in <HI>England;</HI> her body streight, and well shap't; her branches pro∣portionable,
her timber excellent and lasting.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Redwood.</NOTE> Redwood is a handsome tree, but not so loftie as the Mastick, ex∣cellent
timber to work, for it is not so hard as some others, which is
the cause they seldome break their tooles in working it, and that is
the reason the work-men commend it above others. 'Tis a
midling tree for sise, the body about two foot and a halfe dia∣meter.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prickled yellow-wood</NOTE> This is accounted as good as the Red-wood in all respects, and
<PB N="74" REF="46"/>
is a strong and lasting timber, good for building, and for all uses with∣in
doors.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iron wood.</NOTE> Iron wood is called so, for the extream hardnesse; and with that
hardnesse it has such a heavinesse, as they seldome use it in building;
besides, the workmen complain that it breaks all their tools. 'Tis
good for any use without doores, for neither Sun nor rain can any
waies mollifie it. 'Tis much used for Coggs to the Rollers.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lignum vitae.</NOTE> <HI>Lignum vitae</HI> they use now and then for the same purpose, when the
other is away; but having no bowling in that Country, little is used:
They send it commonly for <HI>England,</HI> where we employ it to severall
uses; as, for making Bowles, Cabinets, Tables, and Tablemen.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Locust.</NOTE> The Locust is a tree, not unfitly to be resembled to a Tuscan Pillar,
plain, massie, and rurall, like a well lim'd labourer; for, the burden
it bears being heavy and ponderous, ought to have a body propor∣tionably
built, to bear so great a weight. That rare Architect, <HI>Vitru∣vius,</HI>
taking a pattern from Trees, to make his most exact Pillars, re∣jects
the wreathed, vined, and figured Columnes; and that <HI>Columna
Atticurges,</HI> mentioned by himselfe, to have been a squared Pillar; and
those that are swell'd in the middle, as if sick of a Tympany or Drop∣sie;
and chuses rather the straightest, most exact, and best sis'd to
bear the burthen that lies on them. So, looking on these trees, and
finding them so exactly to answer in proportion to the Tuscan Pillars,
I could not but make the resemblance the other way: For, Pillars can∣not
be more like Trees, then these Trees are like Tuscan Pillars, as
he describes them. I have seen a Locust (and not one, but many) that
hath been four foot diameter in the body, neer the root, and for fifty
foot high has lessened so proportionably, as if it had taken pattern by
the antient Remainders, which <HI>Philander</HI> was so precise in measuring,
which is a third part of the whole shaft upward, and is accounted as
the most gracefull diminution. The head to this body is so proportio∣nable,
as you cannot say, 'tis too heavy or too leight; the branches
large, the sprigs, leaves, and nuts so thick, as to stop all eye-sight from
passing through, and so eeven at top, as you would think you might
walk upon it, and not sink in. The Nuts are for the most part three
inches and a halfe long, and about two inches broad, and somewhat
more then an inch thick; the shell somewhat thicker then a halfe
crown piece, of a russet Umbre, or hair colour; the leaves bigger than
those that grow upon the Ash in <HI>England:</HI> I shall not mention the tim∣ber,
having given it in my Buildings. The Kernells are three or four in
every nut, and between those, a kinde of light pulpie substance, such
as is in a Hazle-nut, before the kernell be grown to the full bignesse: In
times of great famine there, the poor people have eaten them for su∣stenance:
But, of all tastes, I do not like them.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bastard-Locust.</NOTE> Another Locust there is, which they call the bastard-Locust. This
lookes fair, but will not last.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Palmeto the lesse.</NOTE> There is a tree called the <HI>Palmeto,</HI> growing neer the Sea-coast, which
being a sandy light ground,does not afford that substance of mould,
to make a large tree; nor shall you finde in that low part of the Iland,
any considerable trees fit for building, which is a main want and hin∣derance
to them that would build there; for, there is no means to
<PB N="75" REF="46"/>
transport any from the high lands, by reason of the unpassableness of
the wayes; the body of this tree I have seen about 45 or 50 foot high, the
Diameter seldome above 15 or 16 inches, the rind of a pure ash colour,
full of wrinkles, the leaves about two foot and a halfe long, in bun∣ches,
just as if you took twenty large flaggs, with their flat sides toge∣ther,
and tied them at the broader ends. With these bunches they
thatch houses, laying every bunch by himselfe on the lathes, somewhat
to overhang one another, as tiles do. This is a very close kind of
thatch, keeps dry and is very lasting, and looking up to them on the
inside of the room, they are the prettiest becomming figures that I
have seen of that kind, these leaves grow out no where but at the tops
of the trees.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Palmeto Royall.</NOTE> Another kind of Palmeto there is, which as it has an addition to
the name, has likewise an addition to the nature: for I beleive there is
not a more Royall or Magnificent tree growing on the earth, for
beauty and largeness, not to be paralell'd; and excels, so abundant∣ly
in those two properties and perfections, all the rest, as if you had e∣ver
seen her, you could not chuse but fall in love with her; I'm sure
I was extreamly much, and upon good and Antique Authority: For if
<HI>Xerxes</HI> strange Lydian love the Plantane tree, was lov'd for her age,
why may not I love this for her largeness? I beleive there are more wo∣men
lov'd for their largeness then their age, if they have beauty for an
addition, as this has; and therefore I am resolv'd in that poynt, to go
along with the multitude, who run very much that way: but how to
set her out in her true shape and colour, without a Pencill, would aske
a better Pen then mine; yet I will deliver her dimensions as neer truth
as I can, and for her beauty much will arise out of that. But first
I will beg leave of you to shew her in her Infancy, which is about tenne
or twelve years old, at which time she is about seventeen foot high,
her body and her branches, and that part which touches the ground,
not unlike an Inkhorne, which I have seen turn'd in Ivory, round at the
bottome and bellied like that part which holds the Inke; and the stem
or body of the tree, growing less, as that part which holds the Pens,
but turn'd by a more skilfull workman; and some of this body, part
tawny, part purple, with rings of white and green mixt, that go about
her; and these rings at sixe inches distance. This stem, to be about
sixe foot and a halfe high, upon which growes the bottome of the
stalks, thinne as leaves of Parchment, enwrapping one another so
close as to make a continued stem, of the same bigness, for two foot and
a halfe above the other, every one of those filmes or skins, bearing
a stalk, which lessens so insensibly, from the skinne to the poynt
as none but the greater former of all beauty can make the like.</P>
<P>These stalks or branches, are of severall lengths, those that are
the most inward, are the highest; and every one of those stalks adorn'd
with leaves, beginning a little from the filmes to the poynt, and all
these leaves like Cylinders, sharp at either end, and biggest in the
middle: that part of the stem which is the enwrappings of the filmes
of a pure grasse green, shining as parchment dyed green, and slickt
with a slick-stone, and all the branches with the leaves, of a full grass
green spreading every way, and the highest of them eight foot above
<PB N="76" REF="47"/>
the green stem, the other in order to make a well shap't Top, to so
beautifull a stem. The branches sprout forth from the middle, or
intrinsick part of the tree, one at once; and that wrapt up so close as
tis rather like a Pike then a branch with leaves, and that Pike alwayes
bends toward the East; but being opened by the Suns heat spreads
the leaves abroad, at which time the outmost or eldest branch or
sprig below withers and hangs down, and pulls with it the filme that
beares it, and so both it and the filme which holds it up turne of a
ruslet colour and hang down like a dead leafe, till the wind blowes
them off; by which time the Pike above is become a branch, with all
its leaves opened; then comes forth another Pike, and then the next
outmost branch and filme below, falls away as the former, and so
the tree growes so much hig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er▪ as that branch took roome, and so a
pike and a dead leafe, a pike and a dead leafe, till she be advanc't
to her full height which will not be till 100 years be accomplished:
about thirty or forty years old, she will bear fruit, but long before
that time, changes her shape, her belly being lessened partly by the
multiplicity of roots, she shoots down into the earth (nature foresee∣ing
how great a weight they were to beare, and how great a stress
they were to suffer, when the winds take hold of so large a head, as
they were to be crown'd with) and partly by thrusting out sustenance
and substance, to raise and advance the stem or body (for out of this
belly which is the storehouse of all this good it comes) so that now she
becomes taper, with no more lessning then a well shap't arrow, and full
out as straight, her body then being of a bright Ash colour, with some
dapples of green, the filmes a top retaining their smoothness and
greenness, only a little variation in the shape, &amp; that is a little swelling
neer the place that touches the stem or body, not much unlike an
Urinall, so that the swelling that was in the body, is now raised up to
the filmes or skinns above. But at this age, the branches stand not
so upright, as when the tree was in her minority, but has as great beau∣ty
in the stooping and declension, as she had in the rising of her bran∣ches,
when her youth thrusts them forth with greater violence and
vigour, and yet they had then some little stooping neer the poynts.
And now there is an addition to her beauty by two green studds, or
supporters, that rise out of her sides, neer the place where the filmes
joyne to the tree, and they are about three foot long, small at the place
from whence they grow, but bigger upwards, purely green and not
unlike the Iron that Glasiers use to melt their Sawder with.</P>
<P>One growes on one side of the tree, the other on the other side, and
between these two of the same height, on either side the tree, a bush
upon which the fruit growes, which are of the bigness of large French
grapes, some green, some yellow, some purple, and when they come to
be purple, they are ripe, and in a while fall down, and then they yellow
becomes purple, and the green yellow; and so take their turnes, till
the tree gives over bearing. These fruits we can hardly come by
being of so great a height, nor is it any great matter: for the taste is not
pleasant; but the Hoggs find them very agreeable to their palats
for those that eat of them grow suddenly fat. I have seen an <HI>Negre</HI>
with two short ropes clyme the tree, and gather the fruit, about this

time, she is 80 foot high, and continues that forme, without variation;
only as she growes older, so taller and larger; and has alwaies green,
yellow, and purple fruit, succeeding one another; whether there be
blossomes, I know not, for I never went so high as to look. This
sort of trees I have seen of all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ises, from ten, to two hundred foot
high; and I have been told by some of the antient Planters, that
when they came first upon the Iland, they have seen some of them
three hundred foot high: And some reasons I have to perswade me to
believe it; for, amongst those that I have seen growing, which I have
guest to be two hundred foot high, the bodies of which I measured,
and found to be but sixteen inches diameter. And I once found in a
wood, a tree lying, which seem'd to have been long fallen; for, the
young wood was so grown about her, as standing at one end, I could
not see the other: But, having a couple of Negres with me, that were
axe-men, I caused them to cut away the wood that grew about the
tree, that I might come to the other end, which I thought would ne∣ver
be done, she was so long, and yet a great part of her cut off, and
carried away. I measured the diameter of her stem, and found it to be
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5 inches.</P>
<P>Now if we go by the rule of Three, and say, If 16 inches diamiter
make 200 foot high, what shall 25 inches? And by this rule we shall
prove her to be 312 foot high. But the branches of this tree were all
carried away, so that I could see none of them. But I have measured
a branch of one of those trees of 200 foot high, and found it 25 foot

long. So then, by the same Rule: If 200 foot high bear a branch of
25 foot long, what shall a Treee of 312 foot high do? And I see by
the same Rule, it appears to be 39 foot long And one of these trees,
after she comes to bear fruit, will have no lesse then 20 branches at
once, (but many more in her nonage) and halfe of them hold this
length. I have seen a branch of one of these small trees of 200 foot
high, fallen down, and blown from the tree in the falling, twenty
paces off, which has made me admire from whence it should come:
For, the tree being of so great a height, the branches lose much of their
bignesse and length by their distance: But, lying on the ground,
where we can take the just measure, we find what they are. And it
is an admirable thing, to see the form of this spring of branch, which is
not above two inches broad where it joynes to the film, and is lessen∣ing
of the breadth from that end to the point, which is twenty five
foot long, so insensible, as it is not possible to discern where the dimi∣nution
is. So smooth, so eeven, so firme and tough, as though it be
not wood, 'tis much stronger, and ables to endure the weather, or any
kinde of bending. The leaves that grow upon this stalk, are all of
<PB N="78" REF="49"/>
them (unlesse towards the points) two foot long; that part which tou∣ches
the stalk, small, but strong enough to bear the leafe, and has a
little short stalk, to which the leafe growes, which leafe is as exactly
form'd as the stalk, growing by degrees, to make two inches broad
in the middle, and losing that breadth insensibly to the point. These
leaves are thin, but tough enough, to endure the strongest winde that
blowes, without being broken, and not above four inches distant one
from another; which multiplicity of leaves, makes the beauty of the
tree the fuller. About the time this tree parts with her belly, &amp; growes
to a slender kind of shape, she drawes up amongst her roots some of the
soyle that bred her, about two foot higher than the levell of ground
that is neer it; and by reason it is held in by an infinity of small roots,
that come from the body, it there remaines firm, and falls not down;
the outside of this earth is about a foot round about, broader than the
diameter of the tree; so that if the diameter of the tree be a foot, the di∣ameter
of this earth is three foot at top, but somewhat more below;
for the sides are not so steep, as to hold one breadth above and below.
If this earth were beautifull, smooth, and large enough, it might be
called the Pedistan to that Corinthian Pillar, the Palmeto Royall.
But what is wanting in the Pedistall, is supplyed in the dimensions
of the Pillar; for, the Corinthian Pillar is allowed for length but nine
of her own diameters, and this will not aske leave to take 150. which
makes her the more beautifull, since the strength she hath, is able to
support the weight she bears: And for the Architrave, Frize, and Cor∣nise,
they are not to be compar'd with the beauty of the head of this
Pillar, together with the fruit &amp; supporters. And I believe, if <HI>Vitruvius</HI>
himself had ever bin where this Pillar grew, he would have chang'd all
his deckings and garnishings of Pillars, according to the form of this.
And though the Corinthian Pillar be a Columne laciviously deckt,
like a Curtesan, and therein participating (as all inventions do) of
the place where they were first born; <HI>(Corinth</HI> having been without
controversy, one of the wantonnest Townes in the world) yet, this
wants nothing of her beauty, and yet is chast, which makes her the
more admirable, and the more worthy to be prised. One thing more
I have to say of this tree, which is not onely the root that brings forth
all this beauty, but the root of much admiration and wonder; that,
being a tree of that height, bearing a top of so vast an extent, as from
the point of the branches of one side, to the point of the stalk on the
other side, to be 78 foot, upon which, the winde cannot but have a
main power and force; yet, I never saw any of them blown down, nor
any root of this tree bigger then a Swans quill: but there are many
of them, and they fasten themselves in the Rocks, which hold them
very firm. The wood of this tree is so extream hard, and tough with∣all,
as most of the axes that are employed to fell them, are broken in
the work; and they are well enough serv'd, for cutting down such
beauty. The use our Planters made of them at first comming, before
they knew how to make shingles, was, to saw the bodies of these trees
to such lengths, as might reach from the ridge pole, to the Eves of the
house; for, they were hollow, and then sawing them long-wise, there
were two concaves, which they laid together, setting the hollow sides

side downward, and so the whole house over. And this was the use
they made of the bodies of these Trees, for which, very many of them
were destroyed.</P>
<P>But, I doubt, I have tir'd you with naming so many trees, and there∣fore
I will give over; but, with this rule, that which way soever I have
travelled, (from the place I dwelt) either East, West, North, or South,
(but four miles distant) I have still found trees, such as I had never
seen before, and not one of those I have named, and many of them
extreamly large and beautifull. And the neerer the middle of the
Iland, the larger the trees, and the leaves: so that from trees of a hun∣dred
foot high, to a diminution of twenty; and from leaves of eighteen
inches long, with a proportionable breadth to that length, to the smal
ones of halfe an inch, which most of the trees bear that are neer the
<HI>Bridge,</HI> and, I think, neer the Sea, every where you shall finde many,
and the most such. And the reason I have given before; the land in
the highest part of the Iland, being very rich mould, and that neer the
Sea being a sandy light earth. And in the partings or twists of the
branches of those trees, (which I have not named) such excrescences
grow out, as are strange for their formes, and no doubt medicinable
in their natures; such as is our <HI>Misleto,</HI> or <HI>Polypodium,</HI> and much lar∣ger,
and more frequent; but we want skilfull men, to find out their
vertues.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plants that bear fruit. Ginger.</NOTE> There are (besides the Bay-leaves, which, as I told you, might
serve for Cloves, Mace, and Cinamon) two sorts of spices, Ginger,
and red-Pepper: The Ginger being a root which brings forth blades,
not unlike in shape to the blades of Wheat, but broader and thicker,
for they cover the ground so, as you cannot see any part of it. They
are of a popinjay colour, the blossome a pure scarlet. When 'tis ripe▪
we dig up the roots, (cutting off the blades) and put them into the
hands of an Overseer, who sets many of the young Negres to scrape
them, with little knives, or small iron spuds, ground to an edge. They
are to scrape all the outward skin off, to kill the spirit; for, without
that, it will perpetually grow. Those that have Ginger, and not hands
to dresse it thus, are compell'd to scald it, to kill the spirit; and that
Ginger is nothing so good as the other, for it will be hard as wood,
and black; whereas the scrapt Ginger is white and soft, and has a clea∣ner
and quicker taste.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Red Pepper</NOTE> There is of this kinde two sorts, the one so like a childs Corall, as
not to be discerned at the distance of two paces; a crimson and scarlet
mixt, the fruit about three inches long, and shines more then the best
polisht Corall. The other, of the same colour, and glistering as much,
but shap't like a large button of a Cloak; both of one and the same
quality; both so violently strong, as when we break but the skin, it
sends out such a vapour into our lungs, as we fall all a coughing,
which lasts a quarter of an hour after the fruit is removed; but, as
long as we are garbling it, we never give over. This Spice the Spani∣ards
love, and will have it in all their meat, that they intend to have
picant; for a greater <HI>Hough goo</HI> is not in the world. Garlick is faint and
cool to it. It growes on a little shrub, no bigger then a Goosbery-bush.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cucumber.</NOTE> Having inflam'd this leafe with a burning heat,it is, fit to apply a
Cooler, lest it fall on fire; and that is such a one, as is cold in the third
degree, a Cucumber; of which kind we have excellent good, from the
beginning of <HI>November</HI> to the end of <HI>February;</HI> but after▪ that, the wea∣ther
growes too hot. They serve as Sallets cold, with Oyle, Vinegar,
and Pepper; and hot, being stewed, or fryed, of which we make
Sawce for Mutton, Pork, Turkeyes, or Muscovia Ducks. Geese I
never saw but two in the Iland, and those were at the Governours
house.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Millons.</NOTE> Millons we have likewise for those foure months; but before or af∣ter,
the weather is too hot. They are for the most part larger than
here in <HI>England.</HI> I have seen them cut four inches thick; they eat moi∣ster
then here they do, which makes them the lesse wholsome. We
take no other care (after the seeds are put into the ground) but to
weed them. I have seen of them sixteen inches long.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Water-Mil∣lon.</NOTE> The Water Millon there, is one of the goodliest fruites that growes.
I have seen of them, big as a Cloakbag, with a suit of clothes in it; pure∣ly
green, engrayl'd with straw colour; And so wanton Nature is, in
disposing those figures, as though they be upon all parts of the fruit;
yet, they vary and flow so infinitely, as no inch of square or circle is
to be found upon the rinde, that is like one another, and the whole
rinde as smooth as polisht glasse. Where they put out upon the
ground, there they lie; for the Vine they grow by, has not strength to
remove them. This fruit within is not unlike an Apple for colour; but
for taste, not like any fruit I know in <HI>England,</HI> waterish, and wal∣lowish;
yet the people there eat strange quantities of it, two or three
pieces, big, as if cut round about a twelve-penny loafe, an inch thick:
They hold it rarely cooling to the body, and excellent for the stone.
The seeds are of themselves so strong a Purple, as to dye that part of
the fruit it touches, of the same colour; and till they do so, the fruit
is not full ripe: They account the largest, best. Extreamly full of seeds
they are, which in the eating slip out with such ease, as they are not
at all troublesome.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grapes.</NOTE> Grapes we have in the Iland, and they are indifferently well tasted,
but they are never ripe together; some may be pickt out to make
Wine, but it will be so small a quantity, as it will not be worth the

the bunch.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plantine.</NOTE> Though the Plantine bear not the most delitious fruit that growes
on this Iland; yet, for that she is of great use, and beauty too, and for
many other rarities that she excells other Plants in, I shall endeavour
to do her right in my description. And first, for the manner of plan∣ting;
we put a root into the ground, six inches deep, and in a very
short time, there will comeforth three or four sprouts, whereof one
has the precedence, and holds that advantage, (as the prime Hawke
does in an Ayery). And as this sprout growes, it springs from the in∣trinsick
part of the stem, and the out-leaves hang down and rot; but
still new ones come within, and rise up as the Palmeto does, like a
a pike, which opened with the Sun, becomes a leafe; and about the
time it comes to be eight or ten foot high, the pikes, (and consequently

the leaves) will be of their full bignesse, and so (as others grow) con∣tinue
that bignesse, till the last sprout come forth; which is the soul
of the Plant, and will never be a leafe, but is the stem upon which the
fruit must grow. About the time the leaves come to their full bignesse,
they rot no more, but continue in their full beauty; a rich green, with
stripes of yellow so intermixt, as hardly to be discerned where they
are. These leaves are the most of them above six foot long, and two
foot broad; smooth, shining, and stiffe as a Lawrell leafe; and from
the middle of the leaf to the end, such a fall, as a feather has, in a well
shap't plume. But, as all these leaves came out in a pike, so that pike
ever bends a little towards the East, though as soon as it becomes a
a leafe, chuses any point of the Compasse to leane to; and so in a due
proportion, hangs round about the stem. At the time it comes to be of
the full height, the uppermost leaves will be fifteen or sixteen foot
high, and then you shall perceive the stem upon which the fruit must
grow, more then a foot higher than the rest, with a green bunch at
top; which bunch has such a weight, as to make it stoop by degrees,
till it be but seven foot from the ground; and then the green leaves
which held the blossome in, open, and shew the blossome it selfe,
which is of a pure purple, and as big as the heart of a Stagg, and of
that shape, with the point downwards, and so continues, without
opening the leaves, till it be ready to fall off; and when it falls, pulls
with it above a foot of the stalk that held it, which is covered with
yellow blossomes. This purple blossome, when it fell, I guesse to be a
pound weight, besides the stalk it took along with it. After this is
fallen, the fruit growes out from that end which remained; and as it
growes, turnes up towards the stalk that bears it, much like a Grap∣ple,
that holds the long-Boat of a Ship; or, as a dozen large fish-hooks
tied together, turning up severall waies; each turning up of that fruit
being seven or eight inches long, and as bigg as a large Battoon you
walk with. In six months, this Plant will be grown, and this fruit
ripe, which is a pleasant, wholsome, and nourishing fruit, yellow,
when 'tis ripe: But the Negres chuse to have it green, for they eat it
boyl'd, and it is the only food they live upon. Our manner of eating
it, is, when it is full ripe, take off the skin, which will come off with
much ease, and then the fruit looks yellow, with a froath upon it, but
the fruit firme. When it is gathered, we cut down the Plant, and give
it to the Hoggs, for it will never bear more. The body of this plant is
soft, skin within skin, like an Onyon, and between the skins, water
issues forth as you cut it. In three months, another sprout will come
to bear, and so another, and another, for ever; for, we never plant
twice. Groaves we make of these plants, of twenty acres of ground,
and plant them at such distances, and in such rowes, as you do Cher∣ry-trees
in <HI>Kent,</HI> so that we walk under the leaves, as under the Arches
in St. <HI>Faith's</HI> Church under <HI>Pauls,</HI> free from sun and rain.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wild Plan∣tine.</NOTE> The wilde Plantine growes much as the other does, but the leaves
not so broad, and more upright, the fruit not to be eaten; of a scarlet
colour, and almost three square. I know no use of this fruit or leaves,
but to look on.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bonano.</NOTE> The Bonano differs nothing from the Plantine, in the body and
<PB N="82" REF="53"/>
leaves but only this, that the leaves are somewhat lesse, and the bodie
has here and there some blackish spots, the blossome no bigger then a
large bud of a Rose; of a faint purple, and Ash colour mixt, the stalk
that bears it, adorn'd with small blossomes, of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>everall colours; when
they fall off, there comes out of the fruit, which does not turne back
as the Plantines do, but stand outright like a bunch of puddings, all
neere of a length, and each of them between four and five inches
long. This fruit is of a sweeter taste then the Plantine; and for that
reason the <HI>Negroes</HI> will not meddle with them, nor with any fruit that
has a sweet taste; but we find them as good to stew, or preserve as
the Plantine, and will looke and taste more like Quince. This tree
wants little of the beauty of the Plantine, as she appears upon the
ground, in her ful growth; and though her fruit be not so usefull a food
for the belly, as that of the Plantine, yet she has somewhat to delight
the eyes, which the other wants, and that is the picture of Christ up∣on
the Crosse; so lively exprest, as no Limner can do it (with one
colour) more exactly; and this is seen, when you cut the fruit just
crosse as you do the root of Ferne, to find a spread Eagle: but this is
much more perfect, the head hanging down, the armes extended to the
full length, with some little elevation; and the feet cross one upon a∣nother.</P>
<P>This I will speak as an Artist; let a very excellent Limner, paint a
Crucifix, only with one colour, in limning; and let his touches be as
sharp, and as masterly as he pleases, the figure no bigger then this,
which is about an inch long, and remove that picture at such a distance
from the eye, as to loose some of the Curiosity, and dainty touches of
the work, so as the outmost stels, or profile of the figure, may be per∣fectly
discern'd, and at such a distance; the figure in the fruit of the
Bonano, shall seem as perfect as it: much may be said upon this subject
by better wits▪ and abler souls then mine: My contemplation being
only this, that since those men dwelling in that place professing the
names of Christians, and denying to preach to those poor ignorant
harmless souls the <HI>Negroes,</HI> the doctrine of Christ Crucified, which
might convert many of them to his worship, he himselfe has set up his
own Crosse, to reproach these men, who rather then they will loose
the hold they have of them us slaves, will deny them the benefit and
blessing of being Christians. Otherwise why is this figure set up,
for these to look on, that never heard of Christ, and God never made
any thing useless or in vaine.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pine.</NOTE> Now to close up all that can be said of fruits, I must name the Pine; 
for in that single name; all that is excellent in a superlative degree;
for beauty and taste, is totally and summarily included: and if it were
here to speak for it selfe, it would save me much labour, and do it selfe
much right. 'Tis true, that it takes up double the time the Plantine
does, in bringing forth the fruit▪ for ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a full year before it be ripe, but
when it comes to be eaten, nothing of rare taste can be thought on
that is not there; nor is it imaginable, that so full a Harmony of tastes
can be raised, out of so many parts, and all distinguishable. But before
I come to say any thing of that, I will give you some little hints of
her shape, and manner of growth, which though I must acknow∣ledge

my selfe to be down-right lame, in the expression; yet rather
then you shall lose all, I will indeavour to represent some of her beau∣ties,
in such faint expressions as I have. A Slip taken from the body of
this plant, and set in the ground, will not presently take root, but the
Crown that growes upon the fruit it selfe will sooner come to per∣fection
then it; and will have much more beauty all the time of
growing. In a quarter of a year, it will be a foot high, and then the
leaves will be about 7 or 8 inches long, which appeare to your eyes
like Semi-Circles: the middle being a little hollow, so as I have seen
a french sword, that is made for lightness and strength. The colour
for the most part, frost upon green, intermixt with Carnation, and
upon the edges of the leaves, teeth like those upon Sawes; and these
are pure incarnadine. The leaves fall over one another, as they are
plac't higher on the stem; the poynts of the lowest, touching the
ground; in a quarter of a year more, you shall perceive on the top
of the stem a Blossome, as large as the largest Carnation, but of diffe∣rent
colours, very small flakes, Carnation, Crimson and Scarlet, in∣termixt,
some yellow, some blew leaves, and some Peach Colour,
intermixt with Purple, Sky colour, and Orange tawny, Gridaline, and
Gingeline, white and Philyamort. So that the Blossome may be
said to represent many of the varieties to the sight, which the fruit
does to the taste, these colours, will continue a week or tenne dayes,
and then wither and fall away, under which there will appear, a little
bunch of the bigness of a Wallnut; which has in it, all these colours
mixt, which in the blossome were disperst; and so grows bigger for two
months more, before it shews the perfect shape; which is somewhat of
an Ovall forme; but blunt at either end; and at the upper end, growes
out a Crown of leaves, much like those below for colour, but more
beautifull; some of the leaves of this Crown, six inches long; the out
leaves, shorter by degrees. This fruit is inclos'd with a rind, which
begins with a screw at the stalk, and so goes round till it comes to the
top, or Crown, gently rising, which screw is about ¾ of an inch
broad; and the figures, that are imbrodred upon that screw neer of
that dimension, and divisions between. And it falls out so, as those
divisions, are never over one another in the screw, but are alwayes
under the middle of the figures above, those figures do vary so in the
colouring as if you see an hundred Pines, they are not one like another
and every one of those figures, has a little tuft or beard, some of green
some yellow, some Ash colour▪ some Carnation. There are two sorts
of Pines, the King and Queen Pine: The Queen is farre more delicate,
and has her colours of all greens, with their shadowes intermixt, with
faint Carnations, but most of all frost upon green, and Sea greens. The
King Pine, has for the most part, all sorts of yellows, with their sha∣dowes
intermixt with grass greens, and is commonly the larger Pine.
I have seen some of them 14 inches long, and sixe inches in the diame∣tre;
they never grow to be above four foot high, but the most of them
having heavy bodies, and slender stalks, leane down and rest upon the
ground. Some there are, that stand upright, and have comming
out of the stem, below, some sprouts of their own kind, that leave
fruits which jet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out from the stem a little, and then rise upright I
<PB N="84" REF="55"/>
have seen a dozen of these, round about the prime fruit, but not so
high as the bottom of that, and the whole Plant together, shewes like
a Father in the middle, and a dosen Children round about him; and
all those will take their turnes to be ripe, and all very good. When
this fruit is grown to a ripenesse, you shall perceive it by the smell,
which is as far beyond the smell of our choisest fruits of <HI>Europe,</HI> as the
taste is beyond theirs. When we gather them, we leave some of the
stalk to take hold by; and when we come to eat them, we first cut
off the crown, and send that out to be planted; and then with a knife,
pare off the rinde, which is so beautifull, as it grieves us to rob the fruit
of such an ornament; nor would we do it, but to enjoy the pretious
substance it contains; like a Thiefe, that breakes a beautifull Cabinet,
which he would forbear to do, but for the treasure he expects to finde
within. The rinde being taken off, we lay the fruit in a dish, and cut
it in slices, halfe an inch thick; and as the knife goes in, there issues
out of the pores of the fruit, a liquor, cleer as Rock-water, neer about
six spoonfulls, which is eaten with a spoon; and as you taste it, you
finde it in a high degree delicious, but so milde, as you can distinguish
no taste all; but when you bite a piece of the fruit, it is so violently
sharp, as you would think it would fetch all the skin off your mouth;
but, before your tongue have made a second triall upon your palat,
you shall perceive such a sweetnesse to follow, as perfectly to cure that
vigorous sharpnesse; and between these two extreams, of sharp and
sweet, lies the relish and flaver of all fruits that are excellent; and those
tastes will change and flow so fast upon your palat, as your fancy can
hardly keep way with them, to distinguish the one from the other:
and this at least to a tenth examination, for so long the Eccho will last.
This fruit within, is neer of the colour of an Abricot not full ripe, and
eates crispe and short as that does; but it is full of pores, and
those of such formes and colours, as 'tis a very beautifull sight to
look on, and invites the appetite beyond measure. Of this fruit you
may eat plentifully, without any danger of surfeting I have had ma∣ny
thoughts, which way this fruit might be brought into <HI>England,</HI> but
cannot satisfie my selfe in any; preserv'd it cannot be, whole; for, the
rinde is so firm and tough, as no Sugar can enter in; and if you divide
it in pieces, (the fruit being full of pores) all the pure taste will boyle
out. 'Tis true, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> preserve them at <HI>Fernambock,</HI> and send
them home; but they are such as are young, and their rinde soft and
tender: But those never came to their full taste, nor can we know by
the taste of them, what the others are. From the <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmudoes,</HI> some have
been brought hither in their full ripenesse and perfection, where there
has been a quick passage,and the fruites taken in the nick of time; but,
that happens very seldome. But, that they should be brought from the
<HI>Barbadoes,</HI> is impossible, by reason of the severall Climates between.
We brought in the ship seventeen of severall grouths, but all rotten,
before we came halfe the way.</P>

they were planted there by the great Gardiner of the World. Yet,
there is one brought thither as a stranger, from beyond the Line,
which has a property beyond them all; and that is the Sugar-Cane,
which though it has but one single taste, yet, that full sweetnesse has
such a benign faculty, as to preserve all the rest from corruption,
which, without it, would taint and become rotten; and not only the
fruits of this Iland, but of the world, which is a speciall preheminence
due to this Plant, above all others, that the earth or world can boast
of. And that I may the more fully and amply set her off, I will give
you all the observations I made, from my first arrivall on the Iland,
when planting there, was but in its infancy, and but faintly under∣stood,
to the time I left the place, when it was grown to a high per∣fection.</P>
<P>At the time we landed on this Iland, which was in the beginning
of <HI>September,</HI> 1647. we were informed, partly by those Planters we
found there, and partly by our own observations, that the great work
of Sugar-making, was but newly practised by the inhabitants
there. Some of the most industrious men, having gotten Plants from
<HI>Fernambock,</HI> a place in <HI>Brasill,</HI> and made tryall of them at the <HI>Barba∣does;</HI>
and finding them to grow, they planted more and more, as they
grew and multiplyed on the place, till they had such a considerable
number, as they were worth the while to set up a very small Ingenio,
and so make tryall what Sugar could be made upon that soyl. But,
the secrets of the work being not well understood, the Sugars they
made were very inconsiderable, and little worth, for two or three
years. But they finding their errours by their daily practice, began a lit∣tle
to mend; and, by new directions from <HI>Brasil,</HI> sometimes by strangers,
and now and then by their own people, (who being covetous of the
knowledge of a thing, which so much concerned them in their parti∣culars,
and for the generall good of the whole Iland) were content
sometimes to make a voyage thither, to improve their knowledge in
a thing they so much desired. Being now made much abler to make
their queries, of the secrets of that mystery, by how much their often
failings, had put them to often stops and nonplusses in the work. And
so returning with more Plants, and better Knowledge, they went on
upon fresh hopes, but still short, of what they should be more skilfull
in: for, at our arrivall there, we found them ignorant in three main
points, that much conduced to the work; <HI>viz.</HI> The manner of Plan∣ting,
the time of Gathering, and the right placing of their Coppers in
their Furnaces; as also, the true way of covering their Rollers, with
plates or Bars of Iron: All which being rightly done, advance much
in the performance of the main work. At the time of our arrivall
there, we found many Sugar-works set up, and at work; but yet the
Sugars they made, were but bare Muscavadoes, and few of them Mer∣chantable
commodities; so moist, and full of molosses, and so ill cur'd,
as they were hardly worth the bringing home for <HI>England.</HI> But about
the time I left the Iland, which was in 1650. they were much bet∣ter'd;
for then they had the skill to know when the Canes were ripe,
which was not, till they were fifteen months old; and before, they
gathered them at twelve, which was a main disadvantage to the ma∣king
<PB N="86" REF="58"/>
good Sugar; for, the liquor wanting of the sweetnesse it ought
to have, caused the Sugars to be lean, and unfit to keep. Besides,
they were grown greater proficients, both in boyling and curing them,
and had learnt the knowledge of making them white, such as you
call Lump Sugars here in <HI>England;</HI> but not so excellent as those they
make in <HI>Brasill,</HI> nor is there any likelyhood they can ever make such:
the land there being better, and lying in a Continent, must needs have
constanter and steadier weather, and the Aire much drier and purer,
than it can be in so small an Iland, as that of <HI>Barbadoes.</HI> And now, see∣ing
this commodity, Sugar, hath gotten so much the start of all the
rest of those, that were held the staple Commodities of the Iland, and
so much over-top't them, as they are for the most part sleighted and
neglected. And, for that few in <HI>England</HI> know the trouble and care of
making it, I think it convenient, in the first place, to acquaint you, as
far as my memory will serve, with the whole processe of the work of
Sugar-making, which is now grown the soul of Trade in this Iland.
And leaving to trouble you and my self, with relating the errours our
Predecessors so long wandred in, I will in briefe set down the right
and best way they practised, when I left the Iland, which, I think, will
admit of no greater or farther improvement.</P>
<P>But, before I will begin with that, I will let you see, how much the
land there hath been advanc'd in the profit, since the work of Sugar
began, to the time of our landing there, which was not above five or
six years: For, before the work began, this Plantation of Major <HI>Hilli∣ards,</HI>
of five hundred acres, could have been purchased for four hun∣dred
pound sterling; and now the halfe of this Plantation, with the
halfe of the Stock upon it, was sold for seven thousand pound sterling
and it is evident, that all the land there, which has been imployed to
that work, hath found the like improvment. And, I believe, when
the small Plantations in poor mens hands, of ten, twenty, or thirty
acres, which are too small to lay to that work, be bought up by great
men, and put together, into Plantations of five, six, or seven hundred
acres, that two thirds of the Iland will be fit for Plantations of Sugar,
which will make it one of the richest Spots of earth under the

<P>And now, since I have put my selfe upon this Discovery, I think it
fit to let you know the nature of the Plant, the right way of planting
it, the manner of growth, the time of growing to ripenesse, the manner
of cutting, bringing home, the place where to lay them, being brought
home, the time they may lie there, without spoile, the manner of
grinding or squeezing them, the conveyance of the liquor to the Ci∣sterns,
how long it may stay there without harme, the manner of boy∣ling
and skimming, with the conveyance of the skimmings into the
Cisterns, in the Still-house, the manner of distilling it, which makes
the strongest Spirits that men can drink, with the temper to be put in;
what the temper is, the time of cooling the Sugar before it be put into
the Pots; the time it staies in the Cureing house, before it be good
Muscavado Sugar. And last, the making of it into Whites, which we
call Lump-Sugar.</P>
<P>First then, it is fit to set down, what manner of place is to be cho∣sen,
<PB N="87" REF="58"/>
to set this Sugar-work, or Ingenio, upon; and it must be the
brow of a small hill, that hath within the compasse of eighty foot,
twelve foot descent, <HI>viz.</HI> from the grinding place, which is the highest
ground, and stands upon a flat, to the Still house, and that by these
descents: From the grinding place to the boyling house, four foot and
a halfe, from thence to the fire-room, seven foot and a halfe; and some
little descent to the Still house. And the reason of these descent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are
these; the top of the Cistern, into which the first liquor runs, is, and
must be, somewhat lower than the Pipe that convaies it, and that is
a little under ground. Then, the liquor which runs from that Cistern
must vent it selfe at the bottom, otherwise it cannot run all out; and
that Cistern is two foot and a halfe deep: and so, running upon a little
descent, to the clarifying Copper, which is a foot and a halfe above
the flowre of the Boyling house, (and so is the whole Frame, where all
the Coppers stand); it must of necessity fall out, that the flowre of the
Boyling house must be below the flowre of the Mill house, four foot
and a halfe. Then admit the largest Copper be a foot and a halfe
deep, the bottom of the Copper will be lower then the flowre of the
Boyling-house, by a foot; the bottom of the Furnaces must be three
foot below the Coppers; and the holes under the Furnaces, into which
the ashes fall, is three foot below the bottom of the Furnaces: A little
more fall is required to the Still-house, and so the account is made
up. Upon what place the Sugar-work is to be set, I have drawn two
Plots, that expresse more than language can do, to which I refer you.
And so I have done with the Ingenio, and now to the work I promised,
which I shall be briefe in.</P>
<P>When I first arrived upon the Iland, it was in my purpose, to ob∣serve
their severall manners of planting and husbandily there; and be∣cause
this Plant was of greatest value and esteem, I desired first the
knowledge of it. I saw by the growth, as well as by what I had been
told, that it was a strong and lusty Plant, and so vigorous, as where it
grew, to forbid all Weeds to grow very neer it; so thirstily it suck't
the earth for nourishment, to maintain its own health and gal∣lantry.</P>
<P>But the Planters, though they knew this to be true, yet, by their
manner of Planting, did not rightly pursue their own knowledge;
for their manner was, to dig small holes, at three foot distance, or there
about, and put in the Plants endwise, with a little stooping, so that
each Plant brought not forth above three or foure sprouts at the most,
and they being all fastned to one root, when they grew large, tall, and
heavy, and stormes of winde and rain came, (and those raines there,
fall with much violence and weight) the rootes were loosened▪ and the
Canes lodged, and so became rotten, and unfit for service in making
good Sugar. And besides, the roots being far assunder, weedes grew
up between, and worse then all weeds, Withs, which are of a stronger
grouth then the Canes, and do much mischiefe where they are; for,
they winde about them, and pull them down to the ground, as dis∣daining
to see a prouder Plant than themselves. But experience taught
us, that this way of planting was most pernicious, and therefore were
resolved to try another, which is, without question, the best, and that
<PB N="88" REF="59"/>
is, by digging a small trench of six-inches broad, and as much deep,
in a straight line, the whole length of the land you mean to plant,
laying the earth on one side the trench as you make it; then lay two
Canes along the bottom of the trench, one by another, and so conti∣nue
them the whole length of the trench, to the lands end, and cover
them with the earth you laid by; and at two foot distance, another of
the same, and so a third, and fourth, till you have finish'd all the land
you intend to plant at that time: For, you must not plant too much
at once, but have it to grow ripe successively, that your work may
come in order, to keep you still doing; for, if it should be ripe altoge∣ther,
you are not able to work it so; and then for want of cutting, they
would rot, and grow to losse: By planting it thus along, two together,
every knot will have a sprout, and so a particular root, and by the
means of that, be the more firmer fixt in the ground, and the better
able to endure the winde and weather, and by their thick growing
together, be the stronger to support one another. By that time they
have been in the ground a month, you shall perceive them to appear,
like a land of green Wheat in <HI>England,</HI> that is high enough to hide a
Hare; and in a month more, two foot high at least. But upon the first
months growth, those that are carefull, and the best husbands, com∣mand
their Overseers to search, if any weeds have taken root, and de∣stroy
them, or if any of the Plants fail, and supply them; for where
the Plants are wanting, weeds will grow; for, the ground is too ver∣tuous
to be idle. Or, if any Withs grow in those vacant places, they
will spread very far, and do much harm, pulling down all the Canes
they can reach to. If this husbandry be not used when the Canes are
young, it will be too late to finde a remedy; for, when they are grown
to a height, the blades will become rough and sharp in the sides, and
so cut the skins of the Negres, as the blood will follow; for their bo∣dies,
leggs, and feet, being uncloathed and bare, cannot enter the
Canes without smart and losse of blood, which they will not endure.
Besides, if the Overseers stay too long, before they repair these void
places, by new Plants, they will never be ripe together, which is a
very great harm to the whole field, for which there is but one reme∣dy,
and that almost as ill as the disease, which is, by burning the
whole field, by which they lose all the time they have grown: But the
roots continuing secure from the fire, there arises a new spring alto∣gether;
so that to repair this losse of time, they have only this recom∣pence,
which is, by burning an army of the main enemies to their pro∣fit,
Rats, which do infinite harm in the Iland, by gnawing the Canes,
which presently after will rot, and become unservicable in the work
of Sugar. And that they may do this justice the more severely, they
begin to make their fire at the out-sides of that land of Canes they
mean to burn, and so drive them to the middle, where at last the fire
comes, and burnes them all; and this great execution they put often
in practice, without Assises or Sessions; for, there are not so great ene∣mies
to the Canes, as these Vermine; as also to the Houses, where they
lay up their stores of Corn and other provisions; and likewise in dwel∣ling
houses for their victualls. For, when the great down-falls of rain
come, which is in <HI>November</HI> and <HI>December,</HI> and in the time of the <HI>Tur∣nado,</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="59"/>
they leave the field, and shelter themselves in the dwelling houses
where they do much mischiefe.</P>
<P>The Canes with their tops or blades, doe commonly grow to
be eight foot high; the Canes themselves, are commonly five or sixe
foot, (I have seen some double that length but 'tis but seldome) the
bodyes of them, about an inch diametre, the knots about five or six
inches distant one from another, many times three or four inches,
some more, some lesse, for there is no certaine rule for that; the colour
of the blades, and tops, pure grass green; but the Canes themselves,
when they are ripe of a deep Popinjay; and then they yeeld the greater
quantity, and fuller, and sweeter juyce. The manner of cutting them
is with little hand-bills, about sixe inches from the ground; at which
time they divide the tops, from the Canes, which they do with the
same bills, at one stroake; and then holding the Canes by the upper
end: they strip off all the blades that grow by the sides of the Canes,
which tops and blades, are bound up in faggots, and put into Carts,
to carry home; for without these, our Horses and Cattle are not able
to work, the pasture being so extreame harsh and sapless, but with these
they are very well nourisht, and kept in heart. The Canes we like∣wise
binde up in faggots, at the same time, and those are commonly
brought home upon the backs of <HI>Assinigoes,</HI> and we use the fashion of
<HI>Devo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shire,</HI> in that kind of Husbandry, (for there we learnt it) which is
small pack-saddles, and crookes, which serve our purposes very fitly,
laying upon each Crook a faggot and one a top, so that each Assinigo
carries his three faggots; and being accustomed to go between
the field and the place where they are to unload, will of themselves
make their returnes, without a guide; So understanding this little
beast is in performing his duty. The place where they unload, is a
little platforme of ground, which is contiguous to the Mill-house,
which they call a <HI>Barbycu;</HI> about 30 foot long, and 10 foot broad; done
about with a double rayle, to keep the Canes from falling out of that
room; where one, or two, or more, (who have other work to do in the
Mill house,) when they see the <HI>Assinigoes</HI> comming, and make a stop
there, are ready to unloade them, and so turning them back againe,
they go immediately to the field, there to take in fresh loading; so that
they may not unfitly be compar'd to Bees; the one fetching home
honey, the other sugar: being laid on the <HI>Barbycu,</HI> we work them out
cleane, and leave none to grow stale, for if they should be more then
two dayes old, the juyce will grow sower, and then they will not be
fit to worke, for their soureness will infect the rest; The longest time
they stay, after they are cut, to the time of grinding, is from Saturday
evening, to Munday morning, at one or two a clock; and the necessity
of Sunday comming between, (upon which we do not work) causes us
to stay so long, which otherwise we would not doe. The manner of
grinding them, is this, the Horses and Cattle being put to their tackle:
they go about, and by their force turne (by the sweeps) the middle
roller; which being Cog'd to the other two, at both ends, turne them
about; and they all three, turning upon their Centres, which are of
Brass and Steele go very easily of themselves, and so easie, as a mans
taking hold, of one of the sweeps, with his hand will turne all the
rollers about with much ease. But when the Canes are put in be∣tween
<PB N="90" REF="60"/>
the rollers, it is a good draught for five Oxen or Horses; a
<HI>Negre</HI> puts in the Canes of one side, and the rollers draw them
through to the other side, where another <HI>Negre</HI> s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ands, and receives
them; and returnes them back on the other side of the middle roller,
which drawes the other way. So that having past twice through,
that is forth and back, it is conceived all the juyce is prest out; yet the
Spaniards have a press, after both the former grindings, to press out
the remainder of the liquor, but they having but small works in
Spaine, make the most of it, whilst we having far greater quantities, are
loath to be at that trouble. The Canes having past to and againe,
there are young Negre girles, that carry them away, and lay them on a
heap, at the distance of six score paces or there abouts; where they
make a large hill, if the worke have continued long: under the rollers,
there is a receiver, as big as a large Tray; into which the liquor falls,
and stayes not there, but runs under ground in a pipe or gutter of
lead, cover'd over close, which pipe or gutter, carries it into the Ci∣stern,
which is fixt neer the staires, as you go down from the Mill-house
to the boyling house. But it must not remaine in that Cisterne a∣bove
one day, lest it grow sower; from thence it is to passe through a
gutter, (fixt to the wall) to the Clarifying Copper, as there is occasi∣on
to use it, and as the work goes on, and as it Clarifies in the first
Copper, and the skumme rises, it is conveyed away by a passage, or
gutter for that purpose; as also of the second Copper, both which
skimmings, are not esteem'd worth the labour of stilling; because the
skum is dirtie and grosse: But the skimmings of the other three Cop∣pers,
are conveyed down to the Still-house, there to remaine in the
Cisterns, till it be a little sower, for till then it will not come over the
helme. This liquor is remov'd, as it is refin'd, from one Copper to
another, and the more Coppers it passeth through, the finer and purer
it is, being continually drawn up, and keel'd by ladles, and skim'd
by skimmers, in the Negres hands, till at last it comes to the tach,
where it must have much labour, in keeling and stirring, and as it
boyles, there is thrown into the four last Coppers, a liquor made of
water and Withs which they call Temper, without which, the Sugar
would continue a Clammy substance and never kerne. The quantities
they put in are small, but being of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>art quality it turnes the ripeness
and clamminesse of the Sugar to cruddle and separate: which you will
find, by taking out some drops of it, to Candy, and suddenly to grow
hard; and then it has inough of the fire. Upon which Essay they
presently poure two spoonfulls of Sallet Oyle into the tach, and then
immediately it gives over to bubble or rise. So after much keeling,
they take it out of the tach, by the ladles they use there, and put it into
ladles that are of greater receipt, with two handles, and by them re∣move
it into the cooling Cisterne, neer the stayers that goes to the fire
roome: But as they remove the last part of the liquor out of the tach,
they do it with all the celerity they can; and suddenly cast in cold
water, to coole the Copper from burning, for the fire in the furnace,
continues still in the same heat: and so when that water is removed
out againe by the Ladles, they are in the same degree carefull, and
quick, as soon as the last Ladle full is taken out, to throw in some of the
<PB N="91" REF="60"/>
liquor of the next Copper to keep the tach from burning, and so fil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
it up out of the next, and that out of the third, and that out of the
fourth, and that out of the Clarifying Copper, and so from the Ci∣stern,
and so from the Mill-house or Ingenio. And so the work goes
on, from Munday morning at one a clock, till Saturday night, (at
which time the fire in the Furnaces are put out) all houres of the day
and night, with fresh supplies of Men▪ Horses, and Cattle. The Li∣quor
being come to such a coolnesse, as it is fit to be put into the Pots,
they bring them neer the Cooler, and stopping first the sharp end of
the Pot (which is the bottom) with Plantine leaves, (and the passage
there no bigger, then a mans finger will go in at) they fill the Pot, and
set it between the stantions, in the filling room, where it staies till it
be thorough cold, which will be in two daies and two nights; and
then if the Sugar be good, knock upon it with the knuckle of your
finger, as you would do upon an earthen pot, to trie whether it be
whole, and it will give a sound; but if the Sugar be very ill, it will nei∣ther
be very hard, nor give any sound. It is then to be removed into
the Cureing house, and set between stantions there: But first, the
stopples are to be pull'd out of the bottom of the pots, that the Mo∣losses
may vent it selfe at that hole, and so drop down upon a gutter
of board, hollowed in the middle, which conveyeth the Molosses
from one to another, till it be come into the Cisterns, of which there
is commonly foure, at either corner one; and there remains, till it rise
to a good quantity, and then they boyl it again, and of that they make
Peneles, a kinde of Sugar somewhat inferiour to the Muscavado; but
yet will sweeten indifferently well, and some of it very well coloured.
The pots being thus opened at the bottoms, the Molosses drops out,
but so slowly, as hardly to vent it selfe in a month▪ in which time, the
Sugar ought to be well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur'de; and therefore they thought fit, to
thrust a spike of wood in at the bottom, that should reach to the top,
hoping by that means, to make way for the Molosses to have the
speedier passage: But they found little amendment in the purging,
and the reason was this, the spike as it went in, prest the Sugar so
hard, as it stopt all pores of passage for the Molosses. So finding no
good to come of this, they devis'd another way, and that was by ma∣king
an augure of Iron, which instrument cuts his way, without pres∣sing
the Sugar, and by that means the Molosses had a free passage,
without any obstruction at all. And so the Sugar was well cur'd in a
month. As for the manner of using it, after it is cur'd, you shall finde it
set down in my Index, to the plot of the Cureing house. And this is the
whole processe of making the Muscavado-Sugar, whereof some is bet∣ter,
and some worse, as the Canes are; for, ill Canes can never make
good Sugar.</P>
<P>I call those ill, that are gathered either before or after the time of
such ripenesse, or are eaten by Rats, and so consequently rotten, or
pull'd down by Withes, or lodg'd by foule weather, either of which,
will serve to spoil such Sugar as is made of them. At the time they
expect it should be well cur'd, they take the pots from the stantions
in the Curing-house, and bring them to the knocking room, which
you shall finde upon the plot of the cureing house; and turning it up∣side
<PB N="92" REF="61"/>
down, they knock the pot hard against the ground, and the Sugar
comes whole out, as a bullet out of a mold; and when it is out, you
may perceive three sorts of colours in the pot, the tops somewhat
brownish, and of a frothy light substance; the bottom of a much dar∣ker
colour, but heavy, grosse, moist, and full of molosses; both which
they out away, and reserve to be boyl'd again, with the molosses for
peneles: The middle part, which is more then two thirds of the
whole pot, and lookes of a bright colour, drie and sweet, they lay by
it selfe, and send it down daily upon the backs of Assinigoes and Ca∣mells,
in leather baggs, with a tarr'd cloth over, to their Store-houses
at the <HI>Bridge,</HI> there to be put in Caskes and Chests, to be ship't away
for <HI>England,</HI> or any other parts of the World, where the best market
is. Though this care be taken, and this course used, by the best hus∣bands,
and those that respect their credits, as, Collonell <HI>James Drax,</HI>
Collonell <HI>Walrond,</HI> Mr. <HI>Raynes,</HI> and some others that I know there; yet,
the greater number, when they knock out their Sugars, let all go to∣gether,
both bottom and top, and so let the better bear out the worse.
But, when they come to the Merchant to be sold, they will not give
above 3 l. 10 s. for the one; and for the other, above 6 l. 4 s. And
those that use this care, have such credit with the Buyer, as they
scarce open the Cask to make a tryall; so well they are assured
of the goodnesse of the Sugars they make; as, of Collonell <HI>James Drax,</HI>
Collonell <HI>Walrond,</HI> Mr. <HI>Raines,</HI> and some others in the Iland that I
know.</P>
<P>I have yet said nothing of making white Sugars, but that is much
quicker said than done: For, though the Muscavado Sugar, require
but a months time to make it so, after it is boyl'd; yet, the Whites re∣quire
four months, and it is only this. Take clay, and temper it with
water, to the thicknesse of Frumenty, or Pease-pottage, and poure it
on the top of the Muscavado Sugar, as it stands in the pot, in the
Cureing-house, and there let it remain four months; and if the clay
crack and open, that the aire come in, close it up with some of the
same, either with your hand, or a small Trowell. And when you knock
open these pots, you shall finde a difference, both in the colour and
goodnesse, of the top and bottom, being but to such a degree, as may
be rank'd with Muscavadoes; but the middle, perfect White, and ex∣cellent
Lump-Sugar, the best of which will sell in <HI>London</HI> for 20 d. a
pound.</P>
<P>I do not remember I have left unsaid any thing, that conduces to
the work of Sugar-making, unlesse it be, sometimes after great rains,
(which moisten the aire more then ordinary) to lay it out upon fair
daies in the Sun, upon cloaths, or in the knocking room, and some∣times
to bring in pans of coals, well kindled, into the Cureing-house.
If I have omitted any thing here, you shall finde it supplyed in the
Indexes of my Plots.</P>
<P>As for distilling the skimmings, which run down to the Still-house,
from the three lesser Coppers, it is only this: After it has remained in
the Cisterns, which my plot shewes you in the Still-house, till it be
a little soure, (for till then, the Spirits will not rise in the Still)
the first Spirit that comes off, is a small Liquor, which we call
<PB N="93" REF="61"/>
low-Wines, which Liquor we put into the Still▪ and draw it off a
gain; and of that comes so strong a Spirit, as a candle being brought
to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> distance, to the bung of a Hogshead or But, where it is kept,
the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pirits will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ie to it, and taking hold of it▪ bring the fire
down to the vessell, and set all a fire, which immediately breakes the
vessell, and becomes a flame, burning all about it that is combustible
matter.</P>
<P>We lost an excellent Negre by such an accident, who bringing a
Jar of this Spirit, from the Still-house, to the Drink-room, in the
night, not knowing the force of the liquor he carried, brought the
candle somewhat neerer than he ought, that he might the better see
how to put it into the Funnell, which conveyed it into the Butt. But
the Spirit being stirr'd by that motion, flew out, and got hold of the
flame of the Candle, and so set all on fire, and burnt the poor Negre
to death, who was an excellent servant. And if he had in the instant of
firing, clapt his hand upon the bung; all had been saved; but he that
knew not that cure, lost the whole vessell of Spirits, and his life to
boot. So that upon this misadventure, a strict command was given,
that none of those Spirits should be brought to the Drink-room
ever after in the night, nor no fire or candle ever to come in
there.</P>
<P>This drink, though it had the ill hap to kill one Negre, yet it has
had the vertue to cure many; for when they are ill, with taking cold,
(which often they are) and very well they may, having nothing un∣der
them in the night but a board, upon which they lie, nor any thing
to cover them: And though the daies be hot, the nights are cold, and
that change cannot but work upon their bodies, though they be hardy
people. Besides, comming home hot and sweating in the evening, sit∣ting
or lying down, must needs be the occasion of taking cold, and
sometimes breeds sicknesses amongst them, which when they feel, they
complain to the Apothecary of the Plantation, which we call Doctor,
and he gives them every one a dram cup of this Spirit, and that is a
present cure. And as this drink is of great use, to cure and refresh the
poor Negres, whom we ought to have a speciall care of, by the la∣bour
of whose hands, our profit is brought in; so is it helpfull to our
Christian Servants too; for, when their spirits are exhausted, by their
hard labour, and sweating in the Sun, ten hours every day, they find
their stomacks debilitated, and much weakned in their vigour every
way, a dram or two of this Spirit, is a great comfort and refreshing
to them. This drink is also a commodity of good value in the Planta∣tion;
for we send it down to the <HI>Bridge,</HI> and there put it off to those
that retail it. Some they sell to the Ships, and is transported into for∣raign
parts, and drunk by the way. Some they sell to such Planters,
as have no Sugar-works of their owne, yet drink excessively of it, for
they buy it at easie rates; halfe a crown a gallon was the price, the
time that I was there; but they were then purposing to raise the price
to a deerer rate. They make weekly, as long as they work, of
such a Plantation as this 30 l. sterling, besides what is drunk by their
servants and slaves.</P>
<P>And now for a close of this work of Sugar, I will let you see, by way
<PB N="94" REF="62"/>
of estimate, to what a Revenue this Iland is raised; and, in my opini∣on,
not improbable. If you will be pleased to look back to the extent
of the Iland, you shall find, by taking a medium of the length and
breadth of it, that there is contained in the Iland 392 square miles;
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
out of which we will substract a third part, which is the most remote
part of the Iland from the <HI>Bridge,</HI> where all, or the most part of Trade
is, which by many deep and steep Gullies interposing, the passage is
in a manner stop'd: besides, the Land there is not so rich and fit to
bear Canes as the other; but may be very usefull for planting pro∣visions
of Corn, Yeams, Bonavista, Cassavie, Potatoes; and likewise of
Fruites, as, Oranges, Limons, Lymes, Plantines, Bonanoes; as also, for
breeding Hoggs, Sheep, Goats, Cattle, and Poultry, to furnish the rest
of the Iland, that want those Commodities. For which reasons, we
will substract a third part from 392. and that is 130. and so the re∣maining
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is 262 square miles; the greatest part of which may be
laid to Sugar-works, and some to be allowed and set out for small
Plantations, which are not able to raise a Sugar-work or set up an In∣genio,
by reason of the paucity of acres, being not above twenty, thir∣ty,
or forty acres in a Plantation; but these will be fit to bear Tobacco,
Ginger, Cotten-wool, Maies, Yeames, and Potatoes; as also for bree∣ding
Hoggs. But most of these will in short time, be bought up by
great men, and laid together, into Plantations of five, sixe, and seven
hundred acres. And then we may make our computation thus, <HI>viz.</HI>
A mile square will contain 640 acres of land, and here we see is 262
acres, being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Iland. So then, we multiply 262. by 640. and the
product will amount unto 167680. Now we will put the case, that
some of those men that have small Plantations, will not sell them, but
keep them for provisions, which they may live plentifully upon;
for those provisions they raise, will sell at good rates; for which use,
we will set out thirty thousand acres. So then we substract 30000
acres from 167680, and there will remain 137680 acres, to be for
Sugar-works; out of which, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may be planted with Canes, the other
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for Wood, Pasture, and Provisions, which must support the Plan∣tations,
according to the scale of Collonell <HI>Modiford</HI>'s Plantation, as I
<PB N="95" REF="62"/>

said before. Now these two fifts are, as you see 55072 acres, and an
acre of good Canes will yield 4000 pound weight of Sugar, and none
will yield lesse then 2000 weight; but we will take a <HI>Medium,</HI> and rest
upon 3000 weight, upon which we will make our computation, and
set our price upon the Sugar, according to the lowest rates, which
shall be 3 d. per pound, as it is Muscavado, to be sold upon the Iland,
at the <HI>Bridge.</HI> In fifteen months the Canes will be ripe, and in a month
more, they will be well cur'd, and ready to be cast up, and stowed in
the Ware-house. So here, we make our computation upon the place,
and say, 3000 threepences is 37 l. 10 s. ten acres of which is 375 l.
sterling. So then we say, if 10 acres of Canes will produce 375 l. what
shall 55072. which is the number of acres contained upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the
land, allotted for Sugar Plantations, upon which the Canes must grow:
and by the Rule of 3. we finde, that it amounts to 2665200. in six∣teen
months: Now add four months more to the time of cureing, and
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
making it into whites, which is that we call Lump-Sugar in <HI>England,</HI>
and then the price will be doubled to 4130400. out of which we will
abate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for waste, and what is cut off from the tops and bottoms of
the pots, which will be good Muscavadoes; but we will abate for that,
and waste <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which is 1032600. and that we will substract from
4130400. and there remaines 3097800. which is the totall of the re∣venue
<PB N="96" REF="63"/>
of Sugars, that grow on the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> for twenty months, and
accounted there, upon the Iland, at the Bridge. But if you will run
the Hazards of the Sea, as all Marchants doe, and bring it for England,
it will sell in London, for 12 d. the pound, and so 'tis doubled againe;
and then it will amount to 6195600▪ and in two months time more it
will be in England. Now you see what a vast Revenew this little spot of
ground can produce in 22 months time; And so I have done with this
plant, onely one touch more, to conclude with all; as Musitians, that first
play a Preludium, next a Lesson, and then a Saraband; which is the
life and spirit of all the rest. So having played you a short Preludium,
to this long and tedious lesson of Sugar and Sugar-making, I do think
fit to give you a Saraband, with my best Touches at last; which shall be
only this, that as this plant has a faculty, to preserve all fruits, that
grow in the world, from corruption and putrifaction; So it has a ver∣tue,
being rightly applyed, to preserve us men in our healths and for∣tunes
too. Doctor <HI>Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ler</HI> one of the most learned and famous Physitians
that this Nation, or the world ever bred, was wont to say that▪
<Q><L>If Sugar can preserve both Peares and Plumbs,</L>
<L>Why can it not preserve as well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur Lungs?</L></Q>
And that it might work the same effect on himselfe, he alwayes dranke
in his Claret wine, great store of the best refin'd Sugar, and also pre∣scribed
it severall wayes to his Patients, for Colds, Coughs, and Ca∣tarrs;
which are diseases, that reign much in cold Climats, especially
in Ilands, where the Ayre is moyster then in Continents; and so much
for our Health.</P>
<P>Now for our fortunes, they are not only preserv'd, but made by the
powerfull operation of this plant.</P>
<P>Colonell <HI>James Drax,</HI> whose beginning upon that Iland, was found∣ed
upon a stock not exceeding 300 l. sterling, has raised his fortune
to such a height, as I have heard him say, that he would not look
towards England, with a purpose to remaine there, the rest of his life,
till he were able to purchase an estate, of tenne thousand pound land
yearly; which he hop'd in few years to accomplish, with what he was
then owner of; and all by this plant of Sugar. Colonell <HI>Thomas Modi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord,</HI>
has often told me, that he had taken a Resolution to himselfe,
not to set his face for England, till he made his voyage, and imploy∣ment
there, worth him a hundred thousand pounds sterling; and all by
this Sugar plant. And these, were men of as piercing sights, and
profound judgments, as any I have known in that way of management.
Now if such Estates as these, may be raised, by the well ordering this
plant, by Industrious and painfull men, why may not such estates, by
carefull keeping, and orderly and moderate expending, be preserv'd,
in their posterities, to the tenth Generation; and all by the sweet Ne∣gotiation
of Sugar?</P>
<P>One Vegetable we have on the Iland, which will neither become
the name of a Tree, nor a Plant; and that is a Withe; which is in some
respect, the harmefullest weed that can grow; for it pulls downe all
that it can reach to, Canes, and all other small plants, it makes nothing
<PB N="98" REF="63"/>
of; if it be suffer'd to look up in a Garden, it will wind about all Herbs
and Plants that have stalks, pull them down and destroy them; or if it
find the way into any Orchard, it will clime up by the bodies of the
trees, into the branches, and there inwrap them so, as to draw them
(as it were) into a purse, (for out of the maine stalk, hundreds of smal
sprigs will grow;) and if any other tree be so neer as to touch it, it will
find the way to it, and pull the tops of them together, and utterly
disfigure the trees, and hinder the growth of the fruit; and if you cut
the maine stalk below, neer the root in hope to kill it, the moysture a∣bove
in the branches, will thrust down a vine into the ground, and get
a new root: Nay this is not all the mischiefe, for it will reach the high∣est
timber, and involve and enwrap so the branches, as to hinder their
growths, and many times fasten one tree to another, that one shall
hinder the growth of another. A couple of Colonel <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>axes</HI> Axemen,
were felling a tree, and about the time it began to bend, that they
perceiv'd which way it would fall, got cleare on the other side, and
thought themselves safe: But this being fastned to another, by strong
withes, pull'd a great branch of that tree after it, which fell upon the
fellers, and bruised them so, as they hardly scap'd with their lives.
Cleere a passage of tenne foot broad, that goes between a wood and a
land of Canes overnight, and come next morning, and you shall find
the way crost all over with Withs, and got neere the Canes; So that
if you had left your visit till the next day, they had gotten into the
Canes, and then it would be too late to help; for when they are mixt
with them, you cannot destroy the one without the other, for where∣soever
they touch ground they get new roots, and so creep into
every place, and as they go pull down all. These harmefull Withs,
have, with all these vices, some virtues. They serve for all uses, where
roaps or cords are required, as for binding our Wood and Canes into
faggots, or what else roapes are needfull for; and without them we
were in ill condition, for we have not any wood fit to make hoops for
hogsheads, barrels, tubbs, or what not; and we can have them of
what length and bignesse we please, and they are for that use very
good.</P>
<P>Severall kinds of these Withs there are, some that beare fruit,
somewhat bigger then the Cod of a Beane, which being divided long∣wise
with a sharp knife, you shall perceive the most various and beau∣tifullest
Colours that can be, and so well matcht, as to make up a very
great beauty.</P>
<P>Fell a dosen acres of wood, going on in a straight line, and when
the ground is cleered, the side of that wood you left standing, will be
likewise in the same strait line, and in a few years these Withs will
mount, to the tops of the trees, which are for the most part, eighty or
100. foot high, and from that top to the ground, on the outside of the
wood, all will be cover'd with leaves, and those are broad, green, and
shining, so that if you be absent from the place two or three years,
and look to find a wood, you find a faire green Curtaine, 300 paces
long, and 80 foot high, which is as pretty a <HI>deceptio visus,</HI> as you can
find any where▪ and this is one of the pleasantest Vis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>os in the Iland,
the same things are done in the mouths or entrances of Caves, where
<PB N="98" REF="64"/>
you shall find a Cave large enough to hold 500 men, and the mouth
of it, cover'd with a green curtaine, 40 foot high, and 200 foot long;
and so close a Curtaine it is (the vines being wrapt and interwove one
into another) as without putting it aside, you can hardly have light to
read by.</P>
<P>These Caves are very frequent in the Iland, and of severall dimen∣sions,
some small, others extreamly large and Capacious: The run∣away
Negres, often shelter themselves in these Coverts, for a long time
and in the night range abroad the Countrey, and steale Pigs, Plantins,
Potatoes, and Pullin, and bring it there; and feast all day, upon what
they stole the night before; and the nights being darke, and their bo∣dies
black, they scape undiscern'd.</P>
<P>There is nothing in that Countrey, so usefull as Liam Hounds, to
find out these theeves. I have gone into divers of those Caves, to trye
what kind of ayre is to be found there; and have felt it so close, and
moyst with all, as my breath was neer stopt; and I doe beleive, if I
should remaine there but one night, I should never come out a∣gaine.</P>
<P>I have often wondred, why such vast Caves and Rocks should not
afford some springs of water; the ayre which touches them, being so
very moyst; for we see in England, where Rocks are, Springs of water
issue out; and sometimes (when wet weather is) the moysture hangs up∣on
the Rocks in drops, and so runns down and finds a way to vent it
selfe, into small bibling Springs; But here it does not so, though the
Ayre be much moyster than in England; But certainly the reason is
the extraordinary drinesse, and spunginesse of the stone; which
sucks up all moysture that touches it; and yet it is never satis∣fied.</P>
<P>I had it in my thoughts, to make an Essay, what Sir <HI>Francis Bacons</HI>
experiment solitarie, touching the making of Artificiall Springs would
doe; but troughs of that stone, being of so dry and spungy a quality,
would never have been fit for it, besides we have no brakes growing
there, which is one of the materials us'd in that experiment.</P>
<P>Another sort of Withs we have, but they are made of the gum of
trees, which falls from the boughes, drop after drop, one hanging by
another, till they touch ground; from whence they receive some nou∣rishment,
which gives them power to grow larger, and if it happen
that three or four of them, come down so nere one another as to touch
and the wind twist them together, they appeare so like ropes, as they
cannot be discern'd five paces off, whether it be a rope or a withe. I
have seen of these of severall sises, from the smallest whip cord to the
greatest Cable of the Soveraine; and the most of those timber trees I
have named, has them; some four, some five, some halfe a dozen, hang∣ing
down like Bell ropes, from the branches to the ground, which
was a sight of much rarity to me at first comming.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aloes.</NOTE> <HI>Aloes</HI> we have growing here, very good, and 'tis a beautifull plant;
the leaves four inches broad, ¼ of an inch thick, and about a foot and
a halfe long; with prickles on each side, and the last sprout which rises
up in the middle, beares yellow flowres, one above another, and those
flowres are higher then any of the leaves, by two foot; These thick
<PB N="99" REF="64"/>
leaves we take, and cut them through, and out of them issue the A∣loes,
which we set in the Sun, and that will rarifie it, and make it fit
to keep. But it is the first comming which we save; for, if we let it run
too long, the second running will be much worse; but, before that
comes, we throw away the leafe. The leaves of this Plant, (which we
call <HI>semper vivens</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and growes neer the fire in Kitchins,
hung up to a beam, with an oyl'd clout about the root) with the inner
bark of Elder, and some other ingredients, boyl'd in Sallet-oyle, is the
best medicine in the world for a burn or a scald, being presently ap∣plyed;
and for that the medicine is beyond all that ever was, for that
cure, I will set it down, and 'tis this.</P>
<P>Take <HI>Semper vivens,</HI> Plantine leaves, and the green rinde of Elder,
of each alike quantity, and boyl them in Sallet-oyle, so much as will
draw out all that tincture by boyling; then strain the Oyle well out,
and put it on the fire again, and put to it a small quantity of spirit of
Wine, and so much yellow Wax, as will bring it to the consistance of
a Liniment.</P>
<P>One other Plant we have, and that is the Sensible plant, which clo∣ses
the leavs upon any touch with your hand, or that end of your staff
by which you hold, and in a little time will open again.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flowers.</NOTE> There are very few Flowers in the Iland, and none of them sweet;
as, the white Lilly, which growes in the woods, and is much a fairer
flower then ours; as also a red Lilly, of the same bignesse; but neither
of them sweet. The St. <HI>Jago</HI> flower is very beautifull, but of a nause∣ous
savour. One more we have, and that must not be forgotten for
the rarity, because it opens, when all else close, when the Sun goes
down; and for that reason we call it, the flower of the Moon: It
growes in great tuffs, the leaves almost in the form of a Heart, the
point turning back, the flower somewhat bigger then a Primrose, but
of the purest purple that ever I beheld. When this flower falls off, the
seed appears, which is black, with an eye of purple; shap'd, and of
the sise of a small button, so finely wrought, and tough withall, as it
might serve very well to trim a suit of apparell.</P>
<P>I know no herbs naturally growing in the Iland, that have not been
brought thither from other parts, but Purcelane; and that growes so
universally, as the over-much plenty makes it disesteemed; and we
destroy it as a Weed that cumbers the ground.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">English Herbs and Roots.</NOTE> Rosemary, Time, Winter Savory, sweet Marjerom, pot Marjerom,
Parsley,Penniroyall, Camomile, Sage, Tansie, Lavender, Lavender-Cotten,
Garlick, Onyons, Colworts, Cabbage, Turnips, Redishes,
Marigolds, Lettice, Taragon, Southernwood. All these I carried with
me in seeds, and all grew and prospered well. Leek-Seed I had,
which appeared to me very fresh and good; but it never came up.
Rose trees we have, but they never bear flowers.</P>
<P>There is a Root, of which some of the Negres brought the Seeds,
and planted there, and they grew: 'Tis a very large Root, drie, and
well tasted; the manner of planting it is, to make little hills, as big as
Mole-hills, and plant the seed a top, and as soon as it puts forth the
stalks they turn down to the ground, on either side, and then as they
touch it, they thrust up a stalk, not unlike an Asparagus, but of a
<PB N="100" REF="65"/>
purple colour. These being gathered, and eaten as a Sallet, with oyle,
vinegar, and salt, will serve an ordinary pallet, where no better is to
be had: But the root truly is very good meat, boyl'd with powdred
pork, and eaten with butter, vinegar, and pepper. Most of these
roots are as large, as three of the biggest Turnips we have in <HI>England.</HI>
We carried divers of them to Sea, for our provision, which stood us
in good stead, and would have serv'd us plentifully in our great
want of victualls; but the Rats (of which we had infinite numbers a∣board)
rob'd us of the most part.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strength of the Iland by Nature to Seaward.</NOTE> That part of the Iland which lies to the windeward, and is part
East, part North, the stormes and stiffe windes comming from those
points, have so wash'd away all earthly substance, as there remaines
nothing but steep Rocks; and the Sea being very deep on that side,
the Anchors will hardly touch the bottom, though the Cables be
long; so that what Ship soever rides on that side, comes at her owne
perill. Contrarily, if any Ship be under Sail, on the Leeward side, and
goes but so far out, as to lose the shelter of the Iland, it is certain to be
carried away down to the leeward Ilands, and then it will be a very
hard work to beat it up again, without putting out into the Main.
So that there can hardly be any safe landing, but where the Harbours
and Baies are, which lie to the Southwest; and those places are so de∣fensible
by Nature, as with small costs, they may be very strongly for∣tified.
But they have <HI>been much neglected by the Proprietor,</HI> for which rea∣son,
(and some others) the Planters refused to call him by that name.
There was a Gentleman in the Iland, who pretended to be a Souldier,
and an Ingeneer, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Captain Burrows.</NOTE> that undertook to fortifie all the landing places,
and to furnish them with such store of Artillery, as should be suffici∣ent
to defend them; provided, he might have the Excise paid to him
for seven years, which was promised by the Governour and Assem∣bly.
Whereupon he went to work, and made such a Fort, as when
abler Ingeneers came upon the Iland, they found to be most pernici∣ous;
for, commanding all the Harbour, and not of strength to defend
it selfe, if it were taken by an enemy, might do much harm to the
land-ward. So that at my comming from thence, they were pulling
it down, and instead of it, to make Trenches, and Rampiers, with
Pallisadoes, Horn-works, Curtains, and Counter-scarfes; and having
left a very good Fortification of standing wood, round about the
Iland, near the Sea, these were thought as much as needed for their
defence, against the landing of any forraign Forces, and for their
strength within.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strength of the Iland within land.</NOTE> They built three Forts, one for a Magazine, to lay their Amonition,
and Powder in; the other two, to make their retreats upon all occasi∣ons.
At my comming from thence, they were ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to muster ten
thousand Foot, as good men, and as resolute, as any in the world, and
a thousand good Horse; and this was the strength of the Iland about
the time I came away.</P>
<P>#<NOTE PLACE="marg">How Gover∣ned, &amp; how Divided.</NOTE> They Govern there by the Lawes of <HI>England,</HI> for all Criminall, Ci∣vill,

<P>This Law is administred by a Governour, and ten of his Councill,
four Courts of ordinary Justice, in Civill causes, which divide the

land in four Circuits; Justices of Peace, Constables, Churchwar∣dens,
and Tithing-men: five Sessions in the year, for tryall of Crimi∣nall

And when the Governour pleases to call an Assembly, for the su∣pream

paid to the Minister, but a yearly allowance of a pound of Tobacco,
upon an acre of every mans land, besides certain Church-duties, of
Mariages, Christenings, and Burialls.</P>
<P>A standing Commission there was also, for punishing Adultery and
Fornication, though rarely put in execution.</P>
<P>Something would be said concerning the seasons of the year; but it is
little, &amp; therfore wil be the least troublesome. Four months in the year,
the weather is colder then the other eight, &amp; those are <HI>November, Decem∣ber,
January,</HI> &amp; <HI>February;</HI> yet they are hotter than with us in <HI>May.</HI> There
is no generall Fall of the leafe, every Tree having a particular fall to
himself; as if two Locusts stands at the distance of a stones cast, they
have not their falls at one time; one Locust will let fall the leaves in
<HI>January,</HI> another in <HI>March,</HI> a third in <HI>July,</HI> a fourth in <HI>September;</HI> and so
all months one kinde of Trees, having their severall times of falling:
But if any month falls more leaves then other, 'tis <HI>February;</HI> for so in
my nicest observation I found it. The leaves we finde fallen under the
trees, being the most of them large and stiffe, when they were grow∣ing,
and having many veines, which go from the middle stalk, to the
uppermost extent of the leafe, when the thin part of the leafe is rot∣ten
and consum'd, those veines appear like Anatomies, with the stran∣gest
works and beautifullest formes that I have seen, fit to be kept as a
rarity, in the Cabinets of the greatest Princes. As also the Negres
heads, which we finde in the sands, and they are about two inches
long, with a forehead, eyes, nose, mouth, chin, and part of the neck; I
cannot perceive any root by which they grow, but find them alwaies
loose in the sand; nor is it a fruit that falls from any tree, for then we
should finde it growing; black it is as jet, but from whence it comes,
no man knowes.</P>

<P>Having given you in my Bills of Fare, a particular of such Viands,
as this Iland afforded, for supportation of life, and somewhat for de∣light
too, as far as concernes the Table; yet, what are you the better
<PB N="102" REF="66"/>
for all this, when you must be scorch't up from morning till night
with the torrid heat of the sunne; So as in that twelve hours, you
hardly can finde two, in which you can enjoy your selfe with content∣ment.<NOTE PLACE="marg">[Most of this Para∣graph is mentioned before.]</NOTE>
Or how can you expect to find heat, or warmth in your sto∣mack,
to digest that meat, when the sunne hath exhausted your heat
and spirits so, to your outer parts, as you are chill'd and numb'd
within? For which reason, you are compell'd to take such remedies,
as are almost as ill as the disease; liquors so strong, as to take a∣way
the breath as it goes down, and red pepper for spice, which
wants little of the heat of a fire-coale; and all these will hardly draw
in the heat, which the sun draws out; and part of this deficiency
is occasioned by the improvidence, or inconsideration of the Inha∣bitants,
who build their dwellings, rather like stoves, then houses; for
the most of them, are made of timber, low rooft keeping out the wind,
letting in the sun, when they have means to have it otherwise; for
I will undertake to contrive a house so, as no one shall have just
cause to complaine of any excessive heat; and that which gives this
great remedy, shall bring with it the greatest beauty that can be
look't on. The Palmetoes, which being plac't (as I will give you
directions in my plot) in convenient order, shall interpose so between
the sun and house, as to keep it continually in the shade; and to have
that shade at such a distance, as very little heat shall be felt, in any
time of the day: For shades that are made by the highest tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, are
undoubtedly the coolest, and freshest, by reason it keeps the heat
farthest off. Besides this, there are many advantages to be made,
in the contrivance of the house; for I see the Planters there, never
consider which way they build their houses, so they get them up;
which is the cause that many of them, are so insufferably hot, as nei∣ther
themselves, nor any other, can remaine in them without swel∣tring.</P>
<P>First then, we will consider what the errours are in their contrivan∣ces,
that we may be the better able to shew the best way to mend
them; A single house that is built long-wise, and upon a North and
South line, has these disadvantages: the sun shines upon the East side-walls
from six a clock till eight, so as the beams rest flat upon that side,
for two hours. And the beames resting upon a flat or oblique line (as
that is,) gives a greater heate, then upon a diagonall, which glaun∣ces
the beams aside. As a tennis ball, strook against the side walls of the
Court, glauncing, hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s with lesse force, then when it feels the full resis∣tance
of the end wall, where tis met with a flat oblique line: So the
Sun beames, the more directly they are oppos'd by any flat body, the
more violently they burne. This side-wall being warm'd; the sun
gets higher, and shines hotter, and then the rafters become the oblique
line, which is thinner, and lesse able to resist the beames; and the cove∣ring
being shingles, receives the heat quicker, and re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aines it longer,
than tiles would do, so that for the whole forenoon, that side of the
roofe, receives as much heat, as the sun can give, and so passes over
to the other side, giving it so much the more in the afternoon, as is
increast by warming the house and Aire all the morning before, and so
the Oven being heat on both sides, what can you expect, but that those
<PB N="103" REF="66"/>
within, should be sufficiently bak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: and so much the more, for that the
wind is kept out, that should come to cool it, by shutting up all pas∣sages,
that may let it in, which they alwayes doe, for feare the raine
come with it; and letting in the sun at the West end, where and when,
it shines hottest. Therefore this kind of building is most pernitious to
those that love their health, which is the comfort of their lives: but
you will say, that a double house will lessen much of this heat, by rea∣son
that the West side is not visited by the sun in the morning nor the
East in the afternoon; I doe confesse that to be some little remedy,
but not much, for the double roofes being open to the sun, in oblique
lines, a great part of the forenoon; and being reflected from one side
to another, when it comes to the Meridian (and before and after, at
least two hours,) with the scorching heat it gives to the gutter, which
is between them, and is in the middle of the house from end to end,
will so warme the East side of the house, as all the shade it has in the
afternoon will not cool it, nor make it habitable; and then you may
guesse in what a temper the West side is.</P>
<P>Whereas, if you build your house upon an East and West line, you
have these advantages, that in the morning, the sun never shines in or
neere an oblique line, (which is upon the East end of your house,)
above two hours, and that is from six to eight a clock; and as much in
the afternoon, and not all that time neither; and upon the roofe it
can never shine in an oblique line, but glancing on both sides, cast off
the heat very much; I do confesse that I love a double house, much
better then a single, but if it have a double cover, that is, two gable
ends, and a gutter between, though it be built up an East and West
line: yet the sun (which must lye upon it all the heat of the day) will
so multiply the heat, by reflecting the beames from inside to inside,
and so violently upon the gutter, from both, which you know must be
in the middle of the house, from end to end, as you shall feele that
heat above, too sensibly in the ground stories below, though your sie∣ling
be a foot thick, and your stories sixteen foot high. Therefore
if I build a double house, I must order it so, as to have the division
between either room of a strong wall, or of Dorique Pillers Archt
from one to another; and, in each intercolumniation, a square stud
of stone, for the better strengthening and supporting of the Arches
above; for I would have the roomes Archt over with stone, and the
innermost poynts of the Arches, to test upon the Pillars, and the
whole house to be cover'd with Couples and Rafters, and upon that
shingles, the Ridge Pole of the house: running along over the Pillars
so that the covering is to serve both Arches, that covers your rooms:
by which meanes there is but one Gable end, which will glaunce off
the scorching beames of the sun of either side, as, with the help of
the Arches underneath, there will be little heat felt in the roomes
below. But then a maine care must be had, to the side walls, that the
girders be strong, and very well Dove-tayld, one into another, upon
the Dorique pillars, or partition walls; and well erampt with Iron,
or else the rafters being of that length, will thrust out the side walls
by reason the Arches will hinder the Couplets, from comming so low
as to keep the rafters steady, from opening at the bottom. For pre∣vention
<PB N="104" REF="67"/>
of this great mischiefe, it will be very needfull, to have strong
Butteresses without, and those being plac't just against the Couples,
will be of main concern to the side-walls. If you make the breadth of
your house fifty foot, allowing two foot to the partition, and two foot
to either of the side-walls above, (but more below) which is six foot
in all, you will have remaining forty four foot, which being equally
divided, will afford twenty two foot for the breadth of either room;
you may for the length allow what you please. But this I speak by per∣mission,
and not by direction. But, I will send you a Plot with this,
and an Index annexed to it, of such a house as I would build for plea¦sure
and convenience, if I were to live there, and had mony enough
to bestow; and I believe, with such conveniences and advantages,
for shade and coolnesse, as few people in those Western parts, have
studied, or ever thought on.</P>
<P>And now I have as neer as I can, delivered the sum of all I know of
the Iland of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> both for Pleasures and Profits, Commodities
and Incommodities, Sicknesses and Healthfulnesse. So that it may be
expected what I can say, to perswade or disswade any, that have a
desire to go and live there. But before I give a full answer to that, I
must enquire and be enformed, of what disposition the party is, that
hath this designe; If it be such a one as loves the pleasures of <HI>Europe,</HI>
(or particularly of <HI>England)</HI> and the great varieties of those, let him
never come there; for they are thing he shall be sure to misse. But,
if he can finde in himselfe a willingnesse, to change the pleasures
which he enjoyed in a Temperate, for such as he shall finde in a Tor∣rid
Zone, he may light upon some that will give him an exchange,
with some advantage.</P>
<P>And for the pleasures of <HI>England,</HI> let us consider what they are, that
we may be the better able to judge, how far they are consistent with
the Climate of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and what gainers or losers they will be by
the exchange, that make the adventure; and by the knowledge and
well weighing of that, invite or deter those, that are the great lovers
and admirers of those delights, to come there, or stay away.</P>
<P>And amongst the sports and recreations that the people of <HI>England</HI>
exercise most for their healths, without dores, they are Coursing, Hun∣ting,
and Hawking.</P>
<P>And for the Greyhound, though he be compleat in all his shapes
that are accounted excellent, headed like a Snake, neckt like a Drake,
back't like a Beam, sided like a Breme, tail'd like a Rat, footed like a
Cat, deep breasted, with large phillets and gaskins, excellently win∣ded,
with all else may style him perfect, and of a right race: Yet, what
of all this, if the Country afford no Game to course at; or if there
were, that would amount to nothing; for, in the running of twelve
score yards, they will either bruise their bodies against stumps of
trees, or break their necks down the steep falls of Gullies, which are
there too common.</P>
<P>And for the Huntsman and his Hounds, they will finde themselves
at a dead fault, before they begin; for, upon this soyle, no Stag, with
his lofty well shap't head, and active body, has ever set his nimble
feet; and Herds of Vallow Deer, were never put to make a stand upon
<PB N="105" REF="67"/>
this ground; the nimble Roe-Buck, nor the subtle Fox, the Badger,
Otter, or the fearfull Hare, have ever run their Mases in these Woods.
And then, what use of Hounds?</P>
<P>Onely one kinde are usefull here, and those are Liam Hounds, to
guide us to the runaway Negres, who, as I told you, harbour them∣selves
in Woods and Caves, living upon pillage for many months to∣gether.</P>
<P>And for the Faulconer, though his Hawk have reach'd such excel∣lencies,
as may exalt her praise as high, as her wings can raise her bo∣dy;
yet, she must be taken down to a bare Lure. And the painfull
and skilfull Faulconer, who has applyed himselfe solely to the hu∣mour
of the brave Bird he carries, who must be courted as a Mistresse,
be she never so froward, and like a coy Mistresse, will take check at
any thing, when her liberty gives her license; and though by a pain∣full
and studied diligence, he have reclaimed her so, as to flie at what,
and when, and where, and how she is directed; and she, by her own
practice and observation, has learnt to know, which Spaniell lies, and
which tells truth, that accordingly she may sleight the one, and re∣gard
the other; and with this, has all other qualities that are excellent,
in so noble and heroick a Bird: Yet, this painfull diligence in the Faul∣coner,
this rare perfection in the Hawk, will be of little use, where
there is neither Champion to flie in, Brookes to flie over, nor Game
to flie at. No mountie at a Hieron, to cause the lusty Jerfaulcon to
raise her to a losse of her self, from the eyes of her Keeper, till by ma∣ny
dangerous thorows, she binde with her Quarrie, and both come
tumbling down together. No teem of Ducks, or bunch of Teales, to
cause the high flying Haggard make her stooping, and strike her Quar∣rie
dead. And for the Ostringer, though his well-man'd Goshauk, or
her bold mate the Tarcell, draw a Covert nere so well; yet, no Eye of
Phesants will spring, or porch in these woods.</P>
<LG>
<L>The Eagle and the Sacre sure, here ever misse their prey.</L>
<L>Since Bustard and the Barnacle, are never in the way.</L>
<L>No Tarcel drawes a Covert here, no Lanner sits at mark;</L>
<L>No Merline flies a Partridge neer, no Hobbie dares a Lark.</L>
</LG>
<P>Another pleasure, the better sort of the people of <HI>England</HI> take de∣light
in, which, in my opinion, may be rather call'd a toyle then a
pleasure, and that is Race-Horses, forcing poor beasts beyond their
power, who were given us for our moderate use. These exercises
are too violent for hot Countries, and therefore we will forget
them.</P>
<P>Shooting and Bowling may very well be used here; but at Butts
onely, and in Bares, or close Allies, for the turfe here will never be
fine enough for a Green, nor the ground soft enough, for an Arrow to
fall on. Amongst all the sports without dores, that are used in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
these two are onely sufferable in the <HI>Barbadoes.</HI> But for the sports
within the house, they may all be used there, as, all sorts of Gaming,
<HI>viz.</HI> Chesse, Tables, Cards, Dice, Shovel-abord, Billiards; and some
kinds of Dances, but none of those that are laborious, as high and
<PB N="106" REF="68"/>
loftie Capers, with Turnes above ground; these are too violent for
hot Countries.</P>
<P>Some other kindes of pleasures they have in <HI>England,</HI> which are not
so fully enjoyed in the <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> as, smooth Champion to walk or
ride on, with variety of Landscapes, at severall distances; all there
being hem'd in with Wood, and those trees so tall and lofty, as to
hinder and bar the view so much, as (upon a levell or plain) no Ho∣rison
can be seen. But upon the sides of Hills, which look toward the
Sea, your eye may range as far that way, as the globicall roundnesse
of that watry Element will give way to; but that once seen, the eye
is satisfied, and variety in that object there is none; for no shipping
passe that way, but such as arive at the Iland. 'Tis true, that Woods
made up of such beautifull Trees as grow there, are pleasant things to
look on, and afford a very plentifull delight to the eyes; but when
you are so enclos'd, as hardly to look out, you will finde too quick
and too full a satiety in that pleasure. But as the Woods are cut down,
the Landscapes will appear at farther distances.</P>
<P>Now for the beauty of the Heavens, they are as far transcending all
we ever saw in <HI>England,</HI> or elsewhere 40 Degrees without the Line,
on either side, as the land-objects of the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> are short of ours in
<HI>Europe.</HI> So he that can content himselfe with the beauties of the Hea∣vens,
may there be sufficiently satisfied. But we Mortalls, that till and
love the earth, because our selves are made up of the same mold, take
pleasure sometimes to look downward, upon the fruites and effects
of our own labours; and when we finde them thrive by the blessings
of the great Creator, we look up to give thanks, where we finde so
great a glory, as to put us into astonishment and admiration.</P>
<P>Now for the smelling sense, though we have the blossomes of the
Orange, Limon, Lyme, Cittron, Pomgranate, with the smell of that
admirable fruit the Pine, and others: yet when we consider the in∣finite
variety of the Flowers of <HI>England,</HI> both for beauty and savour,
there is no comparison between them; and the flowers there, are ve∣ry
few in number, and in smell, not to be allowed in competition with
ours of <HI>England:</HI> For, since the differences between the Houses of <HI>York</HI>
and <HI>Lancaster</HI> have been laid aside, no red nor white Rose have
grown there; but the Lillies have taken up the quarrell, and strive in
as high a contest there, as the Roses have done in <HI>England;</HI> for, they
are the fairest and purest, that I have ever seen, both red and white,
but no sweet smell. He that could transplant the flowers of <HI>England</HI>
to the <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> would do a rare work, but I fear to little purpose:
For, though the virtuall beams of the Sun, give growth and life to all
the Plants and Flowers it shines on; yet, the influence is at severall
distances, and so the productions varie; some flowers must be warmed,
some toasted, and some almost scalded; and to transpose these, and
set them in contrary places, were to strive against nature. 'Tis true,
that the Herbs of <HI>England</HI> grow and thrive there, by reason they are
stronger, and better able to endure that change; but Flowers, that are
of a more tender, nature, will not endure so great heat as they finde
there. But to repair this sense, some will say, that Perfumes brought
out of <HI>Europe,</HI> will plentifully supply us: But that will not at all avail
<PB N="107" REF="68"/>
us, for what with the heat and moisture of the aire, it is all drawn out,
as by my own experience I found it to be most true, though I lapp'd
them close up in papers; and put them in drawers of a Cabinet, where
no aire could finde passage, they were so close and for Past<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lls, they
lost both their smell and taste.</P>
<P>As for Musick, and such sounds as please the ear, they wish
some supplies may come from <HI>England,</HI> both for Instruments and voy∣ces,
to delight that sense, that sometimes when they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out
with their labour, they may have some refreshment by their ears; and
to that end, they had a purpose to send for the Musick, that were
wont to play at the <HI>Black <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>yars,</HI> and to allow them a competent sala∣ry,
to make them live as happily there, as they had done in <HI>England:</HI>
And had not extream weaknesse, by a miserable long sicknesse, made
me uncapable of my undertaking, they had employed me in the bu∣sinesse,
as the likeliest to prevail with those men, whose persons and
qualities were well known to me in <HI>England.</HI> And though I found at
<HI>Barbadoes</HI> some, who had musicall mindes; yet, I found others, whose
souls were so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon, and so rive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed to the earth, and the profits
that arise out of it, as their souls were lifted no higher; and those men
think▪ and have been heard to say, that three whip Sawes, going all
at once in a Frame or Pit, is the best and sweetest musick that can en∣ter
their ears; and to hear a Cow of their own low, or an Assinigo
bray▪ no sound can please them better. But these mens souls were ne∣ver
lifted up so high, as to hear the musick of the Sphears, nor to be
judges of that Science, as 'tis practised here on earth; and therefore we
will leave them to their own earthly delights.</P>
<P>For the sense of feeling, it can be applyed but two waies, either in
doing or suffering; the poor Negres and Christian servants, finde it
perfectly upon their heads and shoulders, by the hands of their severe
Overseers; so that little pleasure is given the sense, by this coercive
kind of feeling, more then a plaister for a broken Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; but, this is but a
passive kinde of feeling: But take it in the highest, and most active
way it can be applyed, which is upon the skins of women, and they
are so sweaty and clammy, as the hand cannot passe over, without
being glued &amp; dimented in the passage or motion; and by that means,
little pleasure is given to, or received by the agent or the patient:
and therefore if this sense be neither pleased in doing nor suffering, we
may decline it as uselesse in a Country, where down of Swans, or wool
of Beaver is wanting.</P>
<P>Now for the sense of Tasting, I do confesse, it receives a more
home satisfaction, then all the rest, by reason of the fruites that grow
there; so that the Epicure cannot be deceived, if he take a long jour∣ny
to please his palate, finding all excellent tastes the world has, com∣prehended
in one single fruit, the Pine. And would not any Prince be
content to reduce his base coyne, into Ingoti of pure gold. And so
much shall serve touching the <HI>Barbadoes.</HI></P>
<P>Some men I have known in <HI>England,</HI> whose bodies are so strong and
able to endure cold, as no weather fits them so well as frost and snow;
such Iron bodies would be fit for a Plantation in Russia: For, there is
no traceing Hares under the Line, nor sliding on the Ice under either
<PB N="108" REF="69"/>
Tropick. Others there are that have heard of the pleasures of
<HI>Barbadoes,</HI> but are loath to leave the pleasures of England behind
them. These are of a sluggish humour, and are altogether unfit
for so noble an undertaking; but if any such shall happen to come
there, he shall be transmitted to the innumerable Armie of Pismires,
and Ants, to sting him with such a reproof, as he shall with himselfe
any where rather then amongst them. So much is a sluggard detested in
a Countrey, where Industry and Activity is to be exercised. The
Dwarfe may come there, and twice a year vie in competition with
the Giant: for set them both together upon a levell superficies, and at
noone, you shall not know by their shadowes who is the tallest
man.</P>
<P>The Voluptuous man, who thinks the day not long enough for
him to take his pleasure. Nor the sleepie man who thinks the
longest night too short for him to dreame out his delights, are not fit
to repose and solace themselves upon this Iland; for in the whole
compasse of the Zodiacke, they shall neither find St. Barnabies day, or
St. Lucies night, the Sun running an eeven course, is there an indiffe∣rent
Arbiter of the differences which are between those two Saints,
and like a just and cleere sighted Judge, reconciles those extreams
to a Medium, of 12 and 12 houres, which equality of time is utterly
inconsistent to the humours and dispositions of these men.</P>
<P>But I speak this, to such as have their fancies so Aereall, and refin'd
as not to be pleased with ordinary delight; but think to build and
settle a felicity here: above the ordinary levell of mankind. Such
spirits, are too volatile to fixe on businesse; and therefore I will leave
them out, as useless in this Common-wealth. But such as are made
of middle earth: and can be content to wave those pleasures, which
stand as Blocks, and Percullisses, in their way; and are indeed, the
main Remoras in their passage to their profits. Such may here find
moderate delights, with moderate labour, and those taken moderately
will conduce much to their healths, and they that have industry, to
imploy that well, may make it the Ladder to clyme to a high degree,
of Wealth and opulencie, in this sweet Negotiation of Sugar, provi∣ded
they have a competent stock to begin with; such I mean as may
settle them in a Sugar-work, and lesse then 14000 l. sterling, will not
do that: in a Plantation of 500 acres of land, with a proportionable
stock of Servants, Slaves, Horses, Camels, Cattle, Assinigoes, with an
Ingenio, and all other houseing, thereunto belonging; such as I have
formerly nam'd.</P>
<P>But one wil say, why should any man that has 14000 l. in his purse,
need to runne so long a Risco, as from hence to the Barbadoes: when
he may live with ease and plenty at home; to such a one I answer,
that every drone can sit and eate the Honey of his own Hive: But he
that can by his own Industry, and activity, (having youth and strength
to friends,) raise his fortune, from a small beginning to a very great
one, and in his passage to that, doe good to the publique, and be
charitable to the poor, and this to be accomplished in a few years,
deserves much more commendation and applause. And shall find
his bread, gotten by his painfull and honest labour and industry, eate
<PB N="109" REF="69"/>
sweeter by much, than his that onely minds his ease, and his belly.</P>
<P>Now having said this much, I hold it my duty, to give what di∣rections
I can, to further any one that shall go about to improve his
stock, in this way of Adventure; and if he please to hearken to my
directions, he shall find they are no Impossibilities, upon which I
ground my Computations: the greatest will be, to find a friend for a
Correspondent, that can be really honest, faithful and Industrious, and
having arriv'd at that happinesse, (which is the chiefest,) all the rest
will be easie; and I shall let you see that without the help of Magick
or Inchantment, this great Purchase of 14000 l. will be made with
3000 l. stock, and thus to be ordered.</P>
<P>One thousand pound, is enough to venture at first, because we that
are here in England, know not what commodities they want most
in the <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and to send a great Cargo of unnecessary things, were to
have them lye upon our hands to losse. This 1000 l, I would have
thus laid out: 100 l. in Linnen Cloth, as Canvas and Kentings, which
you may buy here in London, of French Marchants, at reasonable
rates; and you may hire poor Journy-men Taylers, here in the Citty,
that will for very small wages, make that Canvas into Drawers, and
Petticoats, for men and women Negres. And part of the Canvas,
and the whole of the Kentings, for shirts and drawers for the Chri∣stian
men Servants, and smocks and peticoates for the women. Some
other sorts of Linnen, as Holland or Dowlace, will be there very use∣full,
for shirts and smocks for the Planters themselves, with their
Wives and Children. One hundred pounds more, I would have
bestow'd, part on wollen cloath, both fine and coorse, part on Devon∣shire
Carsies, and other fashionable stuffes, such as will well endure
wearing. Upon Monmoth Capps I would have bestowed 25 l. you
may bespeak them there in Wales, and have them sent up to London,
by the waynes at easie rates. Forty pound I think fit to bestow on
Irish Ruggs such as are made at Killkennie, and Irish stockings, and
these are to be had at St. <HI>James</HI>'s faire at <HI>Bristow;</HI> the stockings are to
be worne in the day, by the Christian servants, the Ruggs to cast about
them when they come home at night, sweating and wearied, with
their labour; to lap about them, when they rest themselves on their
Hamacks at night, than which nothing is more needfull, for the
reasons I have formerly given. And these may either be shipt at
Bristow, if a ship be ready bound for Barbadoes, or sent to London
by waynes which is a cheap way of conveyance. Fifty pound I wish
may be bestowed on shooes, and some bootes, to be made at Nor∣thampton
and sent to London in dry fates, by Carts; but a speciall
care must be taken, that they may be made large, for they will shrink
very much when they come into hot Climats. They are to be made
of severall sises, for men women and children; they must be kept dry
and close, or else the moistnesse of the Ayre will cause them to mould.
Gloves will sell well there, and I would have of all kinds, and all sises,
that are thinne; but the most usefull, are those of tann'd leather, for
they will wash and not shrinke in the wetting, and weare very long
and soople; you may provide your selfe of these, at Evill, Ilemister
and Ilchester, in Somerset shire; at reasonable rates. Fifteen pound I
<PB N="110" REF="70"/>
would bestow in these Commodities. In fashionable Hats and Bands,
both black and coloured, of severall sises and qualities, I would have
thirty pounds bestowed. Black Ribbon for mourning, is much worn
there, by reason their mortality is greater; and therefore upon that
commodity I would bestow twenty pound; and as much in Coloured,
of severall sises and colours. For Silkes and Sattins, with gold and
silver-Lace, we will leave that alone, till we have better advice; for
they are casuall Commodities.</P>
<P>Having now made provision for the back, it is fit to consider the
belly, which having no ears, is fitter to be done for, then talkt to; and
therefore we will do the best we can, to fill it with such provisions,
as will best brook the Sea, and hot Climates: Such are Beefe, well
pickled, and well conditioned, in which I would bestow 100 l. In
Pork 50 l. in Pease for the voyage, 10 l. In Fish, as Ling, Haberdine,
Green-fish, and Stock-fish, 40 l. In Bisket for the voyage, 10 l. Cases
of Spirits 40 l. Wine 150 l. Strong Beer 50 l. Oyle Olive 30 l. Butter
30 l. And Candles must not be forgotten, because they light us to our
suppers, and our beds.</P>
<P>The next thing to be thought on, is Utensills, and working Tooles,
such are whip-Sawes, two-handed Sawes, hand-Sawes, Files of seve∣rall
sises and shapes; Axes, for felling and for hewing; Hatchets, that
will fit Carpenters, Joyners, and Coopers; Chisells, but no Mallets,
for the wood is harder there to make them: Adzes, of severall sises,
Pick-axes, and Mat-hooks; Howes of all sises, but chiefly small ones,
to be used with one hand, for with them, the small Negres weed the
ground: Plains, Gages, and Augurs of all sises; hand-Bills, for the
Negres to cut the Canes; drawing-Knives, for Joyners. Upon these
Utensills I would bestow 60 l. Upon Iron, Steel, and small Iron pots,
for the Negres to boyl their meat, I would bestow 40 l. And those
are to be had in <HI>Southsex</HI> very cheap, and sent to <HI>London</HI> in Carts, at
time of year, when the waies are drie and hard. Nailes of all sorts,
with Hooks, Hinges, and Cramps of Iron; and they are to be had at
<HI>Bromigham</HI> in <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> much cheaper then in <HI>London▪</HI> And upon
that Commodity I would bestow 30 l. In Sowes of Lead 20 l. in
Powder and Shot 20 l. If you can get Servants to go with you, they
will turn to good accompt, but chiefly if they be Trades-men, as,
Carpenters, Joyners, Masons, Smiths, Paviers, and Coopers. The
Ballast of the Ship, as also of all Ships that trade there, I would have
of Sea-coales, well chosen, for it is a commodity was much wan∣ting
when I was there, and will be every day more and more, as the
Wood decayes: The value I would have bestowed on that, is 50 l.
which will buy 45 Chauldron, or more, according to the burthen of
the Ship. And now upon the whole, I have outstript my computation
145 l. but there will be no losse in that; for, I doubt not, (if it please
God to give a blessing to our endeavours) but in twelve or four∣teen
months, to sell the goods, and double the Cargo; and, if you
can stay to make the best of your Market, you may make three for
one.</P>
<P>This Cargo, well got together, I could wish to be ship't in good
order, about the beginning of <HI>November,</HI> and then by the grace of God,
<PB N="111" REF="70"/>
the Ship may arrive at the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> (if she make no stay by the way)
about the middle of <HI>December;</HI> and it is an ordinary course to sail thi∣ther
in six weeks: Comming thither in that cool time of the year, your
Victualls will be in good condition to be removed into a Store-house,
which your Correspondent (who, I account, goes along with it)
must provide as speedily as he can, before the Sun makes his return
from the Southern Tropick; for then the weather will grow hot, and
some of your Goods, as, Butter, Oyle, Candles, and all your Liquors,
will take harme in the remove.</P>
<P>The Goods being stowed in a Ware<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>house, or Ware houses, your
Correspondent must reserve a handsome room for a Shop, where his
servants must attend; for then his Customers will come about him,
and he must be carefull whom he trusts; for, as there are some good,
so there are many bad pay-masters; for which reason, he must pro∣vide
himselfe of a Horse, and ride into the Country to get acquain∣tance;
and halfe a dosen good acquaintance, will be able to enform
him, how the pulse beats of all the rest: As also by enquiries, he will
finde, what prices the Goods bear, which he carries with him, and
sell them accordingly; and what valews Sugars bear, that he be not
deceived in that Commodity, wherein there is very great care to be
had, in taking none but what is very good and Merchantable, and in
keeping it drie in good Casks, that no wet or moist aire come to it;
and so as he makes his exchanges, and receives in his Sugars, or what
other commodities he trades for, they lie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eady to send away for
<HI>England,</HI> as he findes occasion, the delivering of the one, making
room for the other; for Ships will be every month, some or other,
comming for <HI>England.</HI> If he can transport all his goods, raised upon
the Cargo, in eighteen months, it will be very well. This Cargo be∣ing
doubled at the <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> that returned back, will produce at least
50 <HI>percent.</HI> And then your Cargo, which was 1145 l. at setting out,
and being doubled there to 2290 l. will be at your return for <HI>England
3435 l.</HI> of which I will allow for freight, and all other charges 335 l.
so there remaines to account 3100 l. clear. By which time, I will take
for granted, that your Correspondent has bargained, and gone
through for a Plantation, which we will presuppose to be of five hun∣dred
acres, Stock't as I have formetly laid down▪ (for we must fix
upon one, that our computations may be accordingly) if it be more or
lesse, the price must be answerable, and the Produce accordingly. And
therfore as we began, we will make this our scale, that 14000 l. is to be
paid, for a Plantation of 500 acres Stock't. Before this time, I doubt
not, but he is also grown so well verst in the traffick of the Iland, as to
give you advice, what Commodities are fittest for your next Cargo;
and according to that instruction, you are to provide, and to come
your selfe along with it.</P>
<P>By this time, I hope, your remaining 1855 l. by good employment
in <HI>England,</HI> is raised to 2000 l. So then you have 5100 l. to put into a
new Cargo, which I would not have you venture in one Bottom.
But if it please God, that no ill chance happen, that Cargo of 5100 l.
having then time enough to make your best Market, may very wel dou∣ble,
and 1000 l. over; which 1000 l. I will allow to go out for fraight,
<PB N="112" REF="71"/>
and all other charges. So then, your Cargo of 5100 l. being but dou∣bled,
will amount unto 10200 l. But this Cargo being large, will re∣quire
three years time to sell; so that if you make your bargain for
14000 l. to be paid for this Plantation, you will be allowed three
daies of payment; the first shall be of 4000 l. to be paid in a year af∣ter
you are setled in your Plantation; 5000 l. more at the end of the
year following, and 5000 l. at the end of the year then next following.
And no man will doubt such payment, that sees a visible Cargo upon
the Iland of 10200 l. and the produce of the Plantation to boot. Now
you see which way this purchase is made up, <HI>viz.</HI> 4000 l. the first
payment, 5000 l. the second, and so there remains upon your Cargo
1200 l. towards payment of the last 5000 l. and by that time, the pro∣fit
of your Plantation will raise that with advantage; and then you
have your Plantation clear, and freed of all debts. And we will ac∣count
at the lowest rate, that if two hundred acres of your five hun∣dred,
be planted with Canes, and every Acre bear but three thou∣sand
weight of Sugar, valuing the Sugar but at three pence per pound,
which is thirty seven pound ten shillings every acre, then two hun∣dred
acres will produce 7500 l. in sixteen months; that is, fifteen
months for the Canes to grow and be ripe, and a month to Cure the
Sugar that is made.</P>
<P>But if you stay four months longer, your Muscavado Sugar, which
I valued at three pence per pound, will be Whites, and then the price
will be doubled, and that you see is 15000 l. Out of which we will
abate ¼ part for waste, and for the tops and bottomes of the Pots,
<GAP DESC="math" DISP="〈 math 〉"/>
which may be rank'd with the Muscavadoes, and that is 3750 l. and
then there remains 11250 l. to which we will add the value of the
Drink, that is made of the skimmings, at 120 l. per month, which in
twenty months comes to 2400 l. and then the whole revenue will
amount unto 13650 l. in twenty months. But this profit must come
successively in, as the Sugars are made, and they work all the year,
except in <HI>November</HI> and <HI>December,</HI> when the great downfalls of rain
come: and if they pave the waies, between the Canes, for the Slids
and Assinigoes to passe, they may work then too; for, little else hin∣ders
them, but the unpassablenesse of the waies.</P>
<P>So then you see, that upon the venturing, and well husbanding of
300 l. stock, you are setled in a revenue of 682 l. a month, of which
months we will account 13 in a year, so that after your work is set in
order, and that you will account the yearly revenue, you will finde it
886<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6l. per Annum.</P>
<P>Now let us consider, what the certain charge will be yearly, to
<PB N="113" REF="71"/>
keep the Plantation in the condition we receive it, which we will
suppose to be compleatly furnished, with all that is necessary there∣unto:
And first, of all manner of houseing, as convenient dwelling
houses, the Mill-house, or Grinding-house where the sugar is prest
out; the boyling-house, with five sufficient Coppers for boyling,
and one or two for cooling, with all Utensills, that belong to the Mill,
and boyling-house▪ the filling room, with stantions; the Still-house
with two sufficient Stills, and receivers to hold the drinke, with Ci∣sterns
to all these rooms, for holding liquor, and temper; the Cureing
house fill'd with stantions, two stories high, and commonly in it seven∣teen
or eighteen hundred pots for cureing; the Smiths forge, with
room to lay coales, Iron, and steele; the Carpenter, and Joyners
houses, where they lodge and lay their tools, and much of their fine
worke; with sufficient store-houses, to lay such provision▪ as we
receive from forraine parts, as Beefe, Pork, Fish, Turtle; and also to
keep our drink which is made of the sugar, to the repairing of all
which, the premises with the Appurtenances, we will allow no lesse
then 500 l. Per Annum.</P>
<P>To this, there is yet more to be added: for though we breed both
Negres, Horses, and Cattle; yet that increase, will not supply
the moderate decayes▪ which we finde in all those; especially in
our Horses and Cattell, therefore we will allow for that 500 l. Per
Annum.</P>
<P>The next thing we are to consider is, the feeding of our servants
and slaves, over and above the provisions which the Plantations
beare, and that will be no great matter, for they are not often fed
with bone-meat; But we will allow to the Christian servants,
(which are not above thirty in number,) foure barrels of Beefe,
and as much of Porke yearely, with two barrels of salt Fish, and
500 poore-Johns, which we have from New England, foure barrels
of Turtle, and as many of pickled Makerels, and two of Herrings,
for the Negres; all which I have computed, and finde they will
amount unto 100 l, or there abouts; besides the fruit which will
be no great matter; for you must be sure to have a Factor, both
at New England and Virginia, to provide you of all Commodities
those places afford, that are usefull to your plantation; or else your
charge will be treble. As from New England, Beefe, Porke, Fish, of
all sorts, dried and pickled; from Virginia live-Cattle, Beefe and
Tobacco; for theirs at <HI>Barbadoes</HI> is the worst I think that growes in
the world; And for Cattle, no place lyes neerer to provide
themselves, and the Virginians cannot have a better market
to sell them; for an Oxe of 5 l. pound price at Virginie, will yield 25 l.
there.</P>
<P>But to go on with our computation: for as we have given order for
feeding our people, so we must for their cloathing; and first for the
Christians, which we will account to be thirty in number whereof
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall be men, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> women, that we may make our computation
the more exact; and for the men, (which are twenty in number,)
we will allow one for the supreame Overseer, who is to receive and
give directions, to all the subordinate Overseers, which we allow to
<PB N="114" REF="72"/>
be five more; and those he appoynts to go out with severall Gangs,
some tenne, some twenty, more or lesse, according to the ability of
the overseer hee so imployes; and these are to go out upon severall
Imployments, as he gives them directions, some to weed, some to
plant, some to fall wood, some to cleave it, some to saw it into boards,
some to fetch home, some to cut Canes, others to attend the Ingenio,
Boyling-house, Still-house, and Cureing-house; some for Harvest,
to cut the Maies, (of which we have three Crops every yeare,) others
to gather Provisions, of Bonavist, Maies, Yeames, Potatoes, Cassavie,
and dresse it at fit times for their dinners and suppers, for the Christi∣an
servants; the Negres alwayes dressing their own meat themselves,
in their little Pots, which is only Plantines, boyl'd or roasted, and
some eares of Maies toasted, at the fire; and now and then a Makerell
a piece, or two Herrings.</P>
<P>The Prime Overseer may very well deserve Fifty pounds Per
Annum, or the value in such Commodities as he likes, that are grow∣ing
upon the Plantation; for he is a man that the master may allow
sometimes to sit at his own Table, and therefore must be clad accor∣dingly.
The other five of the Overseers, are to be accounted in the
ranke of Servants, whose freedome is not yet purchased, by their five
years service, according to the custome of the Iland. And for their
cloathing, they shall be allowed three shirts together, to every man
for shifts, which will very well last halfe a year, and then as many
more. And the like proportion for drawers, and for shooes, eve∣ry
month a paire, that is twelve paire a year; six paire of stock∣ings
yeerly, and three Monmouth Capps, and for Sundayes, a doublet
of Canvas, and a plaine band of Holland.</P>

</TEXT></P>
<P>I have been believed in all, or the most part, of my former de∣scriptions
and computations, concerning this Iland, and the waies to
attain the profits that are there to be gathered; but when I come to
this point, no man gives me credit, the businesse seeming impossible,
that any understanding man, that is owner of a Plantation of this
value, should sell it for so inconsiderable a sum: and I do not at all
<PB N="117" REF="73"/>
blame the incredulity of these persons; for, if experience had not
taught me the contrary, I should undoubtedly be of their perswasion.
But lest I should, by an over-weening opinion, hope, that my experi∣ence
(which is only to my selfe) should mislead any man besides his
reason, which every knowing man ought to be guided and governed
by, I will without strayning or forcing a reason, deliver a plain and
naked truth, in as plain language, as is fitting such a subject, which I
doubt not but will perswade much in the businesse.</P>
<P>'Tis a known truth there, that no man has attained to such a for∣tune
as this, upon a small beginning, that has not met with many
rubs and obstacles in his way, and sometimes fallings back, let his
pains and industry be what it will: I call those fallings back, when
either by fire, which often happens there; or death of Cattle, which
is as frequent as the other; or by losses at Sea, which sometimes will
happen, of which I can bring lively instances: If either of these misfor∣tunes
fall, it stands in an equall ballance, whether ever that man re∣cover,
upon whom these misfortunes fall: But, if two of these hap∣pen
together, or one in the neck of another, there is great odds to be
laid, that he never shall be able to redeem himselfe, from an inevi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able
ruine; For, if fire happen, his stock is consumed, and sometimes his
house; if his Cattle die, the work stands still, and with either of these,
his credit falls; so as if he be not well friended, he never can entertain
a hope to rise again.</P>
<P>These toyls of body and minde, and these misfortunes together,
will depresse and wear out the blest spirits in the world, and will cause
them to think, what a happie thing it is, to spend the remainder of
their lives in rest and quiet in their own Countries. And I do believe,
there are few of them, whose mindes are not over-ballanc'd with
avarice and lucre, that would not be glad to sell good penni-worths,
to settle themselves quietly in <HI>England.</HI> Besides the casualties which
I have named, there is yet one of neerer Concern then all the rest, and
that is, their own healths, than which, nothing is more to be valu∣ed;
for, sicknesses are there more grievous, and mortality greater by
far, than in <HI>England,</HI> and these diseases many times contagious: And
if a rich man, either by his own ill diet or distemper, or by infection,
fall into such a sicknesse, he will finde there a plentifull want of such
remedies, as are to be found in <HI>England.</HI> Other reasons, and strong
ones, they have, that induce them to hanker after their own Coun∣try,
and those are, to enjoy the company of their old friends, and to
raise up families to themselves, with a Sum which they have acqui∣red
by their toyle and industry, and often hazards of their lives, whose
beginnings were slight and inconsiderable; and what can be a greater
comfort, both to themselves, and their friends, then such an en∣joyment.
But I speak not this to discourage any man, that has a mind
to improve his Estate, by adventuring upon such a Purchase; for,
though the Planter, by long and tedious pain and industry, have
worn ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his life, in the acquist of his fortune; yet, the Buyer, by his
purchase, is so well and happily seated, as he need endure no such
hardships, but may go on in the managing his businesse, with much
ease, and some pleasure; and in a dosen years, return back with a
<PB N="118" REF="74"/>
very plentifull fortune, and may carry with him from <HI>England,</HI> better
remedies for his health, then they, who for a long time had neither
means to provide, nor mony to purchase it; for, though some Sim∣ples
grow there, that are more proper for the bodies of the Natives,
than any we can bring from forraigne parts, and no doubt would
be so for our bodies too, if wee knew the true use of them; yet
wanting that knowledge, we are faine to make use of our
own.</P>
<P>But when able and skilfull Physitians shall come, whose know∣ledge
can make the right experiment and use of the vertues of those
simples that grow there, they will no doubt finde them more effica∣tious,
and prevalent to their healths, then those they bring from
forraine parts. For certainely every Climate produces Simples more
proper to cure the diseases that are bred there, than those that are trans∣ported
from any other part of the world: such care the great Physitian
to mankind takes for our convenience.</P>
<P>Somewhat I have said of the diseases that raigne in Generall in
this Iland, but have falne on no particuler, though I have felt the
power and Tyranny of it upon mine own body, as much as any man
that has past through it to death, though it pleased the mercifull
God to raise me up againe: for I have it to shew under the hand of
Colonell <HI>Thomas Modiford</HI> in whose house I lay sick, that he saw me
dead without any appearance of life, three several times, not as in soun∣ding
but dying fits, and yet recover'd at last.</P>
<P>To tell the tedious particulars of my sicknesse, and the severall
drenches our Ignorant Quacksalvers there gave me, will prove but
a troublesome relation, and therefore I am willing to decline it: Only
this much, that it began with a Fever, and as it is the custome of
that disease there to cause Bindings, Costivenesse, and consequently
Gripings, and Tortions in the Bowels, so it far'd with me, that for a
fortnight together had not the least evacuation by Seige, which put
me to such Torment as in all that time I have not slept; and want of
that, wore me out to such a weaknesse, as I was not then in a con∣dition
to take any remedy at all. This excessive heat within begat
a new torment within me, the Stone; which stopt my passage so
as in foureteen dayes together no drop of water came from me; But
contrary to my expectation, God Almighty sent me a Remedie
for that, and such a one as all the whole world cannot afford the
like: for in ten hours after I tooke it, I found my selfe not onely
eas'd, but perfectly cur'd of that Torment, at least for the present,
for it not only broke, but brought away all the Stones and gra∣vell
that stopt my passage, so that my water came as freely from me
as ever, and carried before it such quantities of broken stones and gra∣vell,
as in my whole life I have not seen the like. About three weeks or
a month after this, I became in the same distresse and felt the like Tor∣ment,
whereupon I took the same medicine; which gave me the same
help. Now if it did thus to a body so worne out as mine, where Na∣ture
was so decay'd as it could operate little to the cure; what will
this medicine doe, when it meets with such Organs as can contribute
mainly to assist it? But I give the reader but a sooty relation of▪ my
<PB N="119" REF="74"/>
Maladies, and indeed very unfit for his eares, yet when I shal prescribe
the remedy, which may happen to concerne him, I may hope to
make him amends: for truly my touching upon the disease, was but to
usher in the cure, which shall follow close after, and 'tis briefly thus.
Take the Pisle of a green Turtle, which lives in the Sea, dry it with a
moderate heat, pound it in a Morter to powder, and take of this as
much as wil lye upon a shilling, in Beere or the like, Ale or White wine,
and in a very short time it will doe the cure. If this secret had bin
known in Europe but a dosen years since, no doubt we had bin well
stor'd with it by this time, for 'tis to be had both at the <HI>Charibby</HI> and
<HI>Lucayicke</HI> Ilands, where these fishes abound.</P>
<P>Yet so slow was my recovery of the maine sicknesse and my re∣lapses
so frequent, as I was ever and anon, looking out to meet my
familiar Companion Death; my Memory and Intellect suffering the
same decayes with my body, for I could hardly give an account of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the time I was sick; but as my health increast, they return'd. In
three months more, I was able to ride down to the Bridge, where
finding a ship bound for England, I agreed for my passage and dyet
by the way; and (as the manner of all Masters of ships is,) he made me
large promises, of plentifull provisions aboard, as Beefe, Porke, Pease
Fish, Oyle, Bisket, Beere, and some Wine; This Ship had bin fifteen
months out of England, and had traded at <HI>Guinny</HI> and <HI>Binny</HI> for Gold
and Elephants teeth, but those commodities taking up but little room,
the Captaine made the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> in his way home, intending
to take in his full lading of Sugar, and such other commodities as
that Iland afforded; and so being ready to set sayle, my selfe and
divers other Gentlemen embarkt, upon the fifthteenth of April 1650,
at twelve a clock at night; which time our Master made choyce
of, that he might the better passe undescri'd by a well known Pi∣rate,
that had for many dayes layne hovering about the Iland, to
take any ships that traded for London, by vertue of a Commission
as he pretended, from the Marquesse of <HI>Ormond.</HI> This Pirate was an
Irish man, his name <HI>Plunquet,</HI> a man bold enough: but had the
character of being more mercilesse and cruell, then became a valiant
man. To confirme the first part of his character; he took a ship in one
of the Habours of the Iland, out of which he furnisht himselfe with
such things as he wanted, but left the carcase of the vessell, to floate
at large. He had there a Frigot of about 500 Tunns, and a small
vessell to wayte on her, but the night cover'd us from being dis∣discern'd
by him, and so we came safely off the Iland. About a
fortnight after we had bin at sea, our Master complain'd, that his men
had abus'd him, and (for some commodities usefull to themselves)
had truckt away the greatest part of his Bisket; So that instead
of bread, we were serv'd with the sweepings and dust of the bread
roome, which caused a generall complaint of all the passengers
but no remedy: our Pease must now supply that want, which
with some Physicall perswasion of the Master, that it was as hearty
and binding as bread, we rested satisfied, with this Motto,
<HI>Patience upon force.</HI> The next thing wanting, was Fish, an ex∣cellent
food at Sea; and the want of that troubled us much, yet the
<PB N="120" REF="75"/>
same remedy must serve as for the other, Patience. The next
thing wanting was Porke; and the last Beere, which put as clean
out of all Patience; So that now our staple food of the Ship, was
onely Beefe, a few Pease, and for drink water that had bin fifteen
months out of England; finding how ill we were accommoda∣ted,
we desir'd the Master to put in at <HI>Fiall,</HI> One of the Ilands
of <HI>Azores,</HI> a little to refresh our selves, which Iland was not much
out of our way, but the Master loath to be at the charge of re-victual∣ling,
and losse of time; refus'd to hearken to us, and being a request
much to his disadvantage, slighted us and went on, till he was past
recovery of those Ilands, and then a violent storme took us, and in
that storme a sad accident, which happened by meanes of a Por∣tugall,
who being a Sea-man, and trusted at the Helme and, who
though he have a compasse before him, yet is mainely guided by
the quarter Master that Conns the ship above, upon the quarter
deck; whose directions the Portugall mistooke, being not well verst
in the English tongue, and so steer'd the Ship, so neer the winde,
that she came upon her stayes, which caused such a fluttering of the
sayles, against the Masts, (the winde being extreame violent) as
they tore all in peeces, Nor was there any other sayles in the ship,
all being spent in the long voyage to <HI>Guinny;</HI> nor any thread in
the ship, to mend them, so that now the Master (though too
late) began to repent him of not taking our Counsell to goe to
<HI>Fiall.</HI></P>
<P>But how to redeeme us out of this certaine ruine, neither the
Master, nor his Mates could tell; for though the winds blew
never so faire, we lay still at Hull; and to make use of the Tide,
in the Maine, was altogether vaine and hopelesse. Our
victualls too, being at a very low Ebbe, could not last us many
dayes. So that all that were in the ship, both Sea-men and Pas∣sengers,
were gazeing one upon another, what to doe when
our small remainder of provision came to an end. But the
Sea-men, who were the greater number, resolv'd, the Passen∣gers
should be drest and eaten, before any of them should goe to
the Pot; And so the next thing to be thought on was, which
of the Passengers should dye first, for they were all design'd to
be eaten; So they resolved upon the fattest and healthfullest
first, as likely to be the best meat, and so the next, and next, as they
eate Cherries, the best first. In this Election I thought my
selfe secure, for my body being nothing but a bagg-full of Hydrop∣tique
humours, they knew not which way to dresse me, but I
should dissolve and come to nothing in the Cooking; At last the
Cooper took me into his consideration, and said that if they would
hearken to him, there might be yet some use made of me; and
that was in his opinion the best; that seeing my body was not of
a consistence to satisfie their hunger, it might serve to quench
their thirst. So I saying a short Prayer against drought and thirst,
remain'd in expectation of my doome with the rest; So merry these
kinde of men can make themselves, in the midst of dangers, who are
so accustomed to them; And certainely those men, whose lives are so
<PB N="121" REF="75"/>
frequently exposed to such hazards, do not set that value upon them
as others, who live in a quiet security; yet, when they put themselves
upon any noble action, they will sell their lives at such a rate, as none
shall out-bid them; and the custome of these hazards, makes them
more valiant then other men; and those amongst them, that do found
their courage upon honest grounds, are certainly valiant in a high
perfection.</P>
<P>At last, a little Virgin, who was a passenger in the Ship, stood up
upon the quarter deck, like a she-Worthy, and said, that if they
would be rul'd by her, she would not only be the contriver, but
the acter of our deliverance. At whose speech, we all gave a
strict attention, as ready to contribute our help to all she com∣manded;
which was, that the Ship-Carpenter should make her a
Distaffe and Spindle, and the Saylers combe out some of the Occome:
with which instruments and materialls, she doubted not, but to
make such a quantity of thread, as to repair our then uselesse Sailes;
which accordingly she did, and by her vertue (under God) we held
our lives.</P>
<P>Though such an accident as this, and such a deliverance, de∣serve
a gratefull commemoration; yet, this is not all the use we
are to make of it, somewhat more may be considered, that
may prevent dangers for the future; and that is, the great
abuse of Captaines and Masters of Ships, who promise to
their Passengers, such plenty of victualls, as may serve them the
whole voyage: But, before they be halfe way, either pinch them
of a great part, or give them that which is nastie and unwhol∣some.
And therefore I could wish every man, that is to go a long
voyage, to carry a reserve of his own, of such viands, as will
last, and to put that up safe; for, if it be not under lock and
key, they are never the neer; for, the Saylers will as certainly
take it, as you trust it to their honesties: Complaine to the
Master, and you finde no remedy. One thing I have observed,
let a Sayler steal any part of the Ships provision, he shall be sure
to have severe punishment; but, if from a Passenger, though
it concern him never so neerly, his remedy is to be laughed
at. These enormities are fit to be complained on at the Trini∣ty-house,
that some redresse may be had; for, the abuses are
grievous.</P>
<P>Out of this danger at Sea, it has pleased the God of all mercy to
deliver me, as also from a grievous and tedious sicknesse on land, in
a strange Country; For which, may his holy Name be eternally bles∣sed
and praised, for ever and ever.</P>
<P>I am now cast in Prison, by the subtle practices of some, whom
I have formerly called Friends: But the eternall and mercifull
God has been pleased to visit and comfort me, and to raise me
up such friends, as have kept me from cold and hunger, whose
charities in an Age, where cruelties and tyrannies are exercised
in so high a measure, may be accounted a prodigie. But, I
doubt not of my release out of this restraint, by the power of him,
<PB N="122" REF="76"/>
who is able to do all in all. For, as <HI>David</HI> said to <HI>Saul,</HI> that
God, who had delivered him out of the paw of the Lion, and
out of the paw of the Bear, would deliver him from that un∣circumcised
Philistine, <HI>Goliah</HI> of <HI>Gath:</HI> So may I now say; that
God, which has delivered me from a sicknesse to death, on land,
and from shipwrack and hazards at Sea, will also deliver me from
this uncircumcised Philistine, the <HI>Upper Bench,</HI> than which, the
burning fire of a Feavour, nor the raging waves of the Sea,
are more formidable: But, we have seen and suffered
greater things. And when the great Leveller of
the world, Death, shall run his progresse, all
Estates will be laid eeven.</P>
