<HEAD>TO
HIS LOVING
FRIENDS, THE
ADVENTVRERS FOR
NEVV-ENGLAND;
TOGETHER
WITH ALL WELL-WILLERS,
And well-wishers thereunto,
Grace and Peace, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>EW ENGLAND,
so call'd, not onely (to
auoyd nouelties) because
Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> hath so
entituled it in his Descrip∣tion,
but because of the re∣semblance
that is in it, of
England the natiue soile of
English-men; It being
much what the same for
heate and colde in Summer and Winter, it being
Champion ground, but not high mountaines, somwhat
like the soile in <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Essex;</HI> full of Dales, and med∣dow
ground, full of ryuers and sweete springs, as Eng∣land
is. But principally, so farre as we can yet find, it is
an Iland, and neere about the quantitie of England, be∣ing
cut off from the maine land of <HI>America,</HI> as England
is from the maine of <HI>Europe,</HI> by a great arme of the Sea,
which entreth in fortie degrees, and runneth vp North
west and by West, and goeth out either into the South
<PB REF="3"/>
Sea, or else into the Bay of <HI>Canado.</HI> The certaintie
whereof, and secrets of which, we haue not yet so found
as that as eye-witnesses we can make narration thereof,
but if God giue time and meanes, we shall ere long, dis∣couer
both the extent of that Riuer, together with the
secrets thereof; and also try what territories, habitations,
or commodities, may be found, either in it, or about
it.</P>
<P>It pertaineth not to my purpose to speake any thing,
either in prayse, or disprayse of the country, so it is by
Gods prouidence, that a few of vs are there planted to
our content, and haue with great charge and difficultie
attained quiet and competent dwellings there. And
thus much I will say for the satisfaction of such as haue
any thought of going thither to inhabit; That for men
which haue a large heart, &amp; looke after great riches, ease,
pleasure, dainties, and iollitie in this world (except they
will liue by other mens sweat, or haue great riches) I
would not aduise them to come there, for as yet the
country will afford no such matters: But if there be any,
who are content to lay out their estates, spend their time,
labours, and endeuours, for the benefit of them that
shall come after, and in desire to further the Gospell a∣mong
those poore Heathens, quietly contenting them∣selues
with such hardship and difficulties, as by Gods
prouidence shall fall vpon them, being yet yong, and in
their strength, such men I would aduise and encourage
to goe, for their ends cannot faile them.</P>
<P>And if it should please God to punish his people in
the Christian countries of <HI>Europe,</HI> (for their coldnesse,
carnality, wanton abuse of the Gospel, contention, &amp;c.)
either by Turkish slauery, or by Popish tyrannie, which
God forbid, yet if the time be come, or shall come (as
who knoweth) when Sathan shall be let loose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reu. 12. 14. 15</NOTE> to cast
out his flouds against them, here is a way opened for
such as haue wings to flie into this Wildernesse; and as
<PB REF="3"/>
by the dispersion of the Iewish Church thorow per∣secution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 11. 20. 21.</NOTE>
the Lord brought in the fulnesse of the Gen∣tiles,
so who knoweth, whether now by tyrannie, and
affliction, which he suffereth to come vpon them, he
will not by little and little chase them, even amongst
the Heathens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 2. 32.</NOTE> that so a light may rise vp in the darke,
and the kingdome of heauen be taken from them which
now haue it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 21. 43.</NOTE> and giuen to a people that shall bring forth
the fruit of it. This I leaue to the iudgement of the god∣ly
wise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amos 7. 14.</NOTE> being neither Prophet nor sonne of a Prophet,
but considering Gods dealing of olde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 King. 17. 23.</NOTE> and seeing the
name of Christian to be very great, but the true nature
thereof almost quite lost in all degrees &amp; sects, I cannot
thinke but that there is some iudgement not farre off,
and that God will shortly, euen of stones, rayse vp chil∣dren
vnto <HI>Abraham.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 3. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>And who so rightly considereth, what manner of
entrance, abiding, and proceedings, we haue had a∣mongst
these poore Heathens since we came hither, will
easily thinke, that God hath some great worke to doe
towards them.</P>
<P>They were wont to be the most cruellest and treche∣rousest
people in all these parts, euen like Lyons, but to
vs they haue beene like Lambes, so kinde, so submissiue,
and trustie, as a man may truely say many Christians are
not so kinde, nor sincere.</P>
<P>They are very much wasted of late, by reason of a
great mortalitie that fell amongst them three yeares
since, which together with their owne ciuill dissensions
and blouddie warres, hath so wasted them, as I thinke
the twentith person is scarce left aliue, and those that are
left, haue their courage much abated, and their counte∣nance
is deiected, and they seeme as a people affrighted.
And though when we came first into the countrie, we
were few, and many of vs were sicke, and many dyed
by reason of the colde and wet, it being the depth of
<PB REF="4"/>
winter, and we hauing no houses, nor shelter, yet when
there was not sixe able persons amongst vs, and that
they came daily to vs by hundreths, with their <HI>Sachems,</HI>
or <HI>Kings,</HI> and might in one houre haue made a dispatch
of vs yet such a feare was vpon them, as that they ne∣uer
offred vs the least iniury in word or deede. And by
reason of one <HI>Tisquanto,</HI> that liues amongst vs, that can
speake English, we haue daily commerce with their
<HI>Kings,</HI> &amp; can know what is done or intended towards
vs amongst the Savages; Also we can acquaint them
with our courses and purposes, both humane and reli∣gious.
And the greatest Commander of the countrie
call'd <HI>Massasoit,</HI> commeth often to visite vs, though hee
liue fiftie myles from vs, and often sends vs presents,
he hauing with many other of their gouernours promi∣sed,
yea, subscribed obedience to our Soueraigne Lord
King IAMES, and for his cause to spend both strength
and life. And we for our parts, thorow Gods grace,
haue with that equitie, justice, and compassion, carried
our selues towards them, as that they haue receiued
much fauour, helpe, and ayde from vs, but neuer the
least iniury, or wrong by vs. Wee found the place
where we liue emptie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They offer vs to dwell where we will.</NOTE> the people being all dead &amp; gone
away, and none liuing neere by 8. or 10. myles; and
and though in the time of some hardship wee found
(trauelling abroad) some 8. Bushels of Corne hid vp
in a Caue, and knew no owners of it, yet afterward
hearing of the owners of it, we gaue them (in their e∣stimation)
double the value of it. Our care also hath
beene to maintaine peace amongst them, and haue al∣wayes
set our selues against such of them as vsed any re∣bellion,
or trecherie against their gouernours, and not
onely threatned such, but in some sort payd them their
due deserts; and when any of them are in want, as often
they are in the Winter, when their corne is done, wee
supply them to our power, and haue them in our houses
<PB REF="4"/>
eating and drinking, and warming themselues, which
thing (though it be something a trouble to vs) ye be∣cause
they should see and take knowledge of our la∣bours,
orders, and diligence, both for this life and a
better, we are content to beare it, and we find in many
of them, especially, of the younger sort, such a tracta∣ble
disposition, both to Religion and humanitie, as that
if we had meanes to apparell them, &amp; wholly to retaine
them with vs (as their desire is) they would doubtlesse
in time proue seruiceable to God and man, and if euer
God send vs meanes we will bring vp hundreths of their
children, both to labour and learning.</P>
<P>But leauing to speake of them till a further occasion
be offered; If any shall maruell at the publishing of this
Treatise in England, seeing there is no want of good
bookes, but rather want of men to vse good bookes,
let them know, that the especiall end is, that wee may <MILESTONE N="1"/>
keepe those motiues in memory for our selues, &amp; those
that shall come after, to be a remedie against selfe-loue
the bane of all societies. And that also we might testi∣fie <MILESTONE N="2"/>
to our Christian Country-men, who iudge diuersly
of vs, that though we be in a Heathen Country, yet the
grace of Christ is not quenched in vs, but we still hold,
and teach the same points of faith, mortification, and
sanctification, which we haue heard and learned in a
most ample and large maner in our owne country. If
any shall thinke it too rude and vnlearned for this curi∣ous
age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 2. 4.</NOTE> let them know, that to paint out the Gospell in
plaine and flat English, amongst a company of plaine
English-men (as we are) is the best and most profita∣blest
teaching; and we will study plainnesse, not curio∣sitie,
neither in things humaine, nor heauenly. If any
error, or vnsoundnesse be in it, (as who knoweth) im∣pute
it to that frayle man which endited it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 8. 2.</NOTE> which profes∣seth
to know nothing as he ought to know it. I haue
not set downe my name, partly because I seeke no
<PB REF="5"/>
name, and principally, because I would haue nothing
esteemed by names, for I see a number of euils to arise
thorow names, when the persons are either famous, or
infamous, and God and man is often iniured; if any
good or profit arise to thee in the receiuing of it, giue
God the prayse, and esteeme me as a sonne of <HI>Adam,</HI>
subiect to all such frailties as other men are.</P>
<P>And you my louing Friends the Aduenturers to this
plantation; as your care hath beene, first to settle reli∣gion
here, before either profit or popularitie, so I pray
you, goe on, to doe it much more, and be carefull to
send godly men, though they want some of that world∣ly
policie which this world hath in her owne generati∣on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 16. 8.</NOTE>
and so though you loose, the Lord shall gayne. I
reioyce greatly in your free and readie mindes to your
powers, yea, and beyond your powers to further this
worke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro. 3. 9.</NOTE> that you thus honour God with your riches,
and I trust you shall be repayed againe double &amp; treble
in this world, yea, and the memory of this action shall
neuer die, but aboue all adding vnto this (as I trust you
doe) like freenesse in all other Gods seruices, both at
home and abroad, you shall finde a reward with GOD,
ten thousand fold surpassing all that you can doe or
thinke, be not therefore discouraged, for no labour is
lost, nor money spent, which is bestowed for God,
your ends were good, your successe is good, and your
profit is comming, euen in this life, and in the life to
come much more; And what shall I say now, a word
to men of vnderstanding sufficeth, pardon I pray you
my boldnesse, reade ouer the ensuing Treatise, and
judge wisely of the poore weakling,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 42. 1.</NOTE> and the Lord, the
God of Sea and Land, stretch out his arme of protecti∣on
ouer you and vs, and ouer all our lawfull and good
enterprises, either this, or any other way.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>1. Cor. 10. 24.</BIBL>
<Q>Let no man seeke his owne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Text.</NOTE> But euery man ano∣thers
wealth.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE occasion of these words of the Apostle
<HI>Paul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The connexi∣on.</NOTE> was because of the abuses which were in
the Church of <HI>Corinth.</HI> Which abuses arose
cheifly thorow swelling pride, selfe-loue and
conceitednes, for although this Church were
planted by <HI>Paul,</HI> and watred by <HI>Apollo,</HI> and
much increased by the Lord; yet the sower of
tares was not wanting to stirre vp euill
workers and fleshly minded hypocrites,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 13. 25.</NOTE> vnder a shew of godlines,
and with Angellike holinesse in appearance to creepe in amongst
them to disturbe their peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iude 4.</NOTE> trie their soundnesse, and proue their
constancie.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11. 13.</NOTE> And this the Apostle complaines of very often: as
first, in their carnall deuisions, Chap. 1. then in their extolling
their eloquent teachers, and despising <HI>Paul, Chap.</HI> 4. Then in
their offensiue going to Law, before the heathen Iudges Chap. 6.
Then in eating things offered to Idols, to the destroying of the
tender consciences of their Brethren, Chap. 8. Then in their in∣satiable
loue-feastes, in the time and place of their Church mee∣tings,
the rich which could together feede to fulnes, despising and
contemning the poore, that had not to lay it on as they had, Chap
11.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 6. 13.</NOTE> Finally in both the Epistles, hee very often nippeth them
for their pride, and selfe-loue, straitnesse and censorioushes, so
that in the last Chapter hee willeth them againe and againe to
proue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 13. 5.</NOTE> trie and examine themselues, to see whether Christ were
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
in them or not, for howsoeuer many of them seemed as thousands
doe at this day, to soare aloft, and goe with full sayle to heauen:
yet as men that row in Boats,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Similie.</NOTE> set their faces earnestly one way,
when yet their whole body goeth apace another way: so there
are many which set such a face vppon Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iude 16.</NOTE> and haue their
mouthes full of great swelling words: as if they would euen blow
open the doores of heaven, despising all humble minded and bro∣ken
hearted people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 10. 10.</NOTE> as weake, simple, sottish &amp;c. when yet not∣withstanding,
these Blusterers, which seeme to goe so fast, and
leaue all others behind them, if like these glosing <HI>Corinthians</HI> they
carry affectedly their owne glory with them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver. 18.</NOTE> and seeme thus to
stand for the glory of God, What doe they else but ioyne flesh to
spirit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob 1. 9.</NOTE> seruing not God for nought, but for wages, and so seruing
their bellies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 16. 18.</NOTE> whose end will be damnation, except a speedi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and
sound remedie be thought of, which remedie is euen that which
our Sauiour teacheth the rich young gallant, and which <HI>Paul</HI>
heere prescribeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 19. 21.</NOTE> in willing them not to seeke their owne, but e∣uerie
man anothers wealth, which Physicke is as terrible to car∣nall
professors, as abstinence from drinke is to a man that hath
the dropsie: and it is a sure note, that a man is sicke of this disease
of selfe-loue, if this be grieuous to him, as appeareth in the man
whom Christ bid sell that hee had,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver. 22.</NOTE> and hee went away very sor∣rowfull,
yet surely this veine must bee pricked, and this humor
let out, els it will spoyle all, it will infect both soule and body, yea
and the contagion of it is such (as wee shall see anone) as will euen
hazard the welfare of that societie, where selfe seekers and selfe
louers are.</P>
<P>As God then did direct this Apostle to lay downe this briefe
direction as a remedy for that euill in <HI>Corinth,</HI> so you may thinke
it is by Gods speciall providence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 10. 33.</NOTE> that I am now to speake vnto
you from this text: and say in your hearts surely some thing is
amisse this way: let vs know it and amend it.</P>
<P>The parts of this text are two.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diuision.</NOTE> 1. a <HI>Dehortation,</HI> 2. an <HI>Exhortati∣on.</HI>
The Dehortation. <HI>Let no man seeke his owne.</HI> The Exhortation
<HI>But euery man anothers wealth.</HI></P>
<P>In handling of which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Order of hand∣ling.</NOTE> I will first, open the wordes. Secondly,
gather the Doctrine. Thirdly, illustrate the Doctrine by Scrip∣tures,
experience and Reasons. Fourthly, apply the same, to euery
one his portion.</P>
<P>The proper drift of the Apostle heere is not to taxe the <HI>Corinthi∣ans,</HI>
for seeking their owne euill endes in euill actions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Apostles drift.</NOTE> but for
aiming at themselues, and their owne benefits in actions lawfull,
and that appeareth in the former verse, where he sayth. <HI>All things
are lawfull &amp;c.</HI> viz. all such thinges as now wee speake of, to eate
any of Gods creatures, offered to Idols or not, to feast and bee
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
merrie together, to shew loue and kindnesse to this or that per∣son,
&amp;c. but when by such meanes wee seeke our selues, and haue
not a charitable louing and reuerent regard of others, then they
are vnexpedient, vnprofitable, yea vnlawfull, and must bee for∣borne,
and hee that hath not learned to denie himselfe euen the
very vse of lawfull things, when it tendeth to the contempt, re∣proch,
greife offence, and shame of his other Brethren and Asso∣ciats,
hath learned nothing aright, but is apparantly a man that
seekes himselfe, and against whom the Apostle heere dealeth most
properly.</P>
<P>The maner of the speech may seeme as counsell left at libertie:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exposition.</NOTE>
as Mat. 27. 49. and in our ordinary speech, wee thinke they be
but weake charges, which are thus deliuered, let a man doe this,
or let him doe that. But wee must learne the Apostles modestie, and
know that whatsoeuer the termes seeme to imply, yet euen this
and other the like in this Epistle, are most absolute charges: as
<HI>Let a man esteeme of vs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 4. 1.</NOTE> <HI>as the ministers of Christ,</HI> that is, a man ought
so to esteeme of vs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11. 28.</NOTE> <HI>Let a man examine himselfe,</HI> that is, as if he sayd
a man must examine himselfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 14. 34.</NOTE> <HI>Let your women keepe silence in the
Churches.</HI> that is, they ought so to doe.</P>
<P>The meaning then summarily is, as if hee sayd, the bane of all
these mischeifes which arise amongst you is, that men are to
cleauing to themselues, and their owne matters, and disregarde
and contemne all others: and therefore I charge you, let this selfe-seeking
be left off, and turne the streame another way, namely,
seeke the good of your Brethren, please them, honor them, r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue∣rence
them, for otherwise it will neuer goe well amongst you.</P>
<P><HI>But doth not the Apostle else wheresay?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Obiect.</NOTE> That hee, which careth
not for his owne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 5. 8.</NOTE> is worse then an Infidell.</P>
<P>True but by (owne) there, he meaneth properly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Resp.</NOTE> a mans kin∣dred,
and heere by (owne) hee meaneth properly a mans selfe.</P>
<P>Secondly, Hee there especially taxeth such as were negligent in
their labours and callings, and so made themselues vnable to giue
releife and entertainement to such poore Widowes and Orphans as
were of their owne flesh and bloud.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Be it so that some man should euen neglect his owne
selfe, his owne wife, children, friends, &amp;c. and giue that hee had
to strangers, that were but some rare vice, in some one vnnaturall
man, and if this vice stay a thousand, selfe-loue slayeth ten thou∣sand.</P>
<P>And this the wisedome of God did well forsee, and hath set no
caueats in the Scriptures either to taxe men, or forewarne them
from louing others, neither sayth God any wher, let no man seeke
the good of another, but let no man seeke his owne, and euerie
where in the Scriptures he hath set watch words against selfe-good,
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>

<P>Yea and doth not experience teach,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Illustration experimen∣tall.</NOTE> that euen amongst profes∣sors
of Religion, almost all the loue and fauour that is shewed vnto
others is with a secret ayme at themselues, they will take paines to
doe a man good, prouided that he will take twise so much for them
they will giue a penny so as it may aduantage them a pound, la∣bor
hard so as all the profite may come to themselues, else they are
hartlesse and feeble.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Simile.</NOTE> The vaine and corrupt heart of man cannot
better be resembled then by a belly-god, Host, or Inkeeper, which
welcommeth his guests with smilings, and salutations, and a thou∣sand
welcomes, and reioyceth greatly to haue their companie to
dice, card, eate, drinke, and bee merrie, but should not the box be
paid, the pot be filling, and the money telling, all this while the
Epicures ioy would soone be turned into sorrow, and his smiles
turned into frownes, and the doore set open, and their absence cra∣ued:
euen so men blow the bellowes hard, when they haue an I∣ron
of their owne a heating, worke hard whilest their owne house is
in building, dig hard whilest their owne garden is in planting, but is
it so as the profit must goe wholy or partly to others, their handes
waxe feeble, their hearts waxe faint, they grow churlish and giue
crosse answers like <HI>Naball,</HI> they are sowre, discontent, and nothing
will please them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 112. 9.</NOTE> And where is that man to be found, that will sparse

close and secret ends, or ayming at himself? such a man, out of doubt,
is a blacke Swanne, a white Crowe almost, and yet such shall stand
before God with boldnesse at the last day, when others which haue
sought themselues, though for loue of themselues they haue sought
heauen, yea and through selfe loue perswaded themselues they
shoulde finde it, yet wanting loue vnto others, they will be found
as sounding brasse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 13. 1.</NOTE> and as a tinkling Cimbale, and whilst they haue
neglected others, and not cared how others liue, so as themselues
may fare well,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 25. 41. 42.</NOTE> they will be found amongst them, that the Lord will
say vnto, I know you not, depart ye cursed into euerlasting fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</P>
<P>But that I may not walke in generalities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Particular amplific.</NOTE> the particular wayes by
which men seeke their owne are these, First such as are couetous,
seeke their owne by seeking riches, wealth, money, as <HI>Foelix</HI> preten∣ding
loue vnto <HI>Paul,</HI> sent for him often, but it was in hope of mony,<MILESTONE N="1"/>
Many there are who say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 24. 26.</NOTE> <HI>who will shew vs any good,</HI> and pretend
Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 4. 7.</NOTE> as some of the Iewes did the keeping of the Sabboth,
which yet cryed out when will the Sabboth bee done, that wee may
sell corne and gaine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amos 8. 5.</NOTE> if a man can tell them how to get gold out of
a flint, and siluer out of the Adamant, no paines shalbe spared, no
time shall bee neglected, for gold is their hope, and the wedge
of gold is their confidence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob 31. 24.</NOTE> their hearts are set vpon the pelfe of this
world, and for loue of it, all thinges are let slipp, euen all duties to
God or men, they care not how basely they serue, how wretchedly
they neglect all others, so as they may get wealth: pinch who will?
and wring who will, all times are alike with them, and they runne
for the bribe like <HI>Gehazie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 King. 5. 21.</NOTE> and this is the first way that men seeke
their owne.</P>
<P>Now the contrary is seene in <HI>Nehemiah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Neh. 5. 14. 15. 16.</NOTE> who when the people were
hard put to it, and the land raw, he tooke not the dueties which
were due to him being a Magistrate, he bought no land, nor grewe
not rich, for it was no time: but he maintained at his table many of
his brethren the Iewes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 20.</NOTE> and so spent euen his owne proper goods.
And <HI>Paul</HI> sought not mans gold nor siluer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Thes. 3. 9.</NOTE> but though hee had au∣thoritie,
yet he tooke not bread of the Churches, but laboured with
his hands: And why? It was no time to take, some Churches were
poore and stood in want,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver. 8.</NOTE> as <HI>Thessalonica,</HI> others were in danger to be
preyed vpon by couetous belly-gods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 11. 12.</NOTE> as <HI>Corinth:</HI> and therefore hee
saw it no fit time now to take any thing of them.</P>
<P>And indeede heere is the difference betweene a couetous world∣ling,
and an honest thriftie Christian, it is lawfull sometimes for
men to gather wealth, and grow rich, euen as there was a time for
<HI>Ioseph</HI> to store vp corne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 41. 49.</NOTE> but a godly and sincere Christian will see
when this time is, and will not hord vp when he seeth others of his
brethren and associates to want, but then is a time, if hee haue any
thing to fetch it out and disperse it, but the couetous gather good, he
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
like <HI>Achan</HI> couets all that he seeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iosh. 7. 21.</NOTE> and neglects no time, but ga∣thers
still and holds all fast, and if it were to saue the life of his bro∣ther,
his baggs must not be minished, nor his chestes lighted, nor his
field set to sale, gather as much as he can, but its death to diminish
the least part of it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"/> The second way by which men seeke their owne, is when they
seeke ease,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 11. 46.</NOTE> or pleasure, as the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisies,</HI> who would not
touch the burthen with one of their fingers; so, there is a generati∣on,
which thinke to haue more in this world then <HI>Adams</HI> felicitie
in Innocencie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 2. 15.</NOTE> being borne (as they thinke) to take their pleasures,
and their ease,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccle. 10. 18.</NOTE> let the roofe of the house drop thorow, they stirre
not;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro. 24. 30. 31.</NOTE> let the field be ouer-growne with weeds, they care not, they
must not soile their hand, nor wet their foote, its enough for them
to say, Goe you, not let vs goe, though neuer so much need; such
idle Droanes are intollerable in a setled Common-wealth, much
more in a Common-wealth which is but as it were in the bud; of
what earth I pray thee art thou made, of any better then other of
the sonnes of <HI>Adam?</HI> And canst thou see other of thy brethren toile
their hearts out, and thou sit idle at home, or takest thy pleasure a∣broad?
Remember the example of <HI>Vriah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 11. 11.</NOTE> who would not take his
ease, nor his pleasure, though the King required him, and why?
Because his brethren, his associates, better men then himselfe (as he
esteemed them) were vnder hard labours and conditions, lay in
the fields in tents, caues, &amp;c.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3"/> The third way is when men seeke their owne bellies, as some did
in the Apostles times, which went about with new doctrines and
deuices,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 16. 26.</NOTE> knowing that the people had itching eares, and would ea∣sily
entertaine, and willingly feede such nouelists, which brought in
dissensions, schismes, and contentions, and such were rocks, or pil∣lars
in their loue-feasts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iude 12.</NOTE> as <HI>Iude</HI> speaketh, they were shaddowes in
Gods seruice, but when feasting came, then they were substances,
then they were in their element. And certainely there are some men
which shape euen their Religion, humaine state, and all, euen as the
belly cheare is best, and that they must haue, els all heart and life is
gone, let all conscience, care of others goe, let <HI>Lazarus</HI> starue at the
gate, let <HI>Iosephs</HI> affliction be increased, they must haue their dishes,
their dainties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neh. 5. 14.</NOTE> or no content. The contrary was seene in <HI>Nehemiah,</HI>
who would not take his large portion alotted to the gouernour,
because he knew it went short with others of his brethren; and <HI>Vriah</HI>
would not receiue the Kings present and goe banquet with his wife,
because he knew the whole Hoast his brethren were faine to snap
short in the fields.</P>
<P>And the difference betweene a temperate good man, and a belly-God
is this:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob 31. 17.</NOTE> A good man will not eate his morsels alone, especi∣ally
if he haue better then other, but if by Gods prouidence, he haue
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
gotten some meate which is better then ordinary, and better then
his other brethrens, he can haue no rest in himselfe, except he make
other partaker with him. But a belly-God will slop all in his owne
throat, yea, though his neighbour come in and behold him eate,
yet his griple gut shameth not to swallow all. And this may be done
sometimes, as well in meane fare as in greater dainties, for all coun∣tries
afford not alike.</P>
<P>The fourth way by which men seeke their owne, is by seeking <MILESTONE N="4"/>
outward honour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 15. 30.</NOTE> fame, and respect with men, as King <HI>Saul</HI> when he
had lost all respect and fauour with God, then thought to giue con∣tent
to his heart by being honoured before the Elders of the peo∣ple;
and it is wonderfull to see how some men are <HI>desirous of vaine
glory,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 5. 26.</NOTE> and how earnestly they seeke prayse, fauour, and respect with
men, and can haue no quiet longer then their worldly fauour la∣steth,
and that they will haue what dishonour soeuer come to God,
or disgrace vnto men, yea, they will disgrace, reproch, and disdaine
others, to gaine honour and aduancement to themselues, yea, they
will make bold with the Scriptures and word of God, to wrest and
wring, and slight it ouer for their credits sake. And let a man marke
some mens talke, stories, discourses, &amp;c. and he shall see their whole
drift is to extoll and set out themselues, and get praise and commen∣dations
of men.</P>
<P>Now the contrary was seene in <HI>Paul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 3. 2.</NOTE> he sayth, <HI>He needed no letters
of commendations.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 10. 12.</NOTE> And againe, <HI>He is not affected with mens prayse;</HI>
and here is indeed the difference betweene an humble minded
Christian, and a proud selfe-louer; an humble man often hath
prayse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 18. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> as <HI>Dauid, Hezekiah,</HI> and <HI>Iosiah,</HI> but he seekes it not, he desires
it not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 King. 18. 3.</NOTE> he is content to goe without it, he loues not the prayse of
men, for he knowes it is but froth and vanitie: But a proud selfe-lo∣uer,
he seekes it still, get it or not get it, and if he get it he is fully
satisfied, if he get it not he hangs the head like a Bull-rush, and hath
no comfort.</P>
<P>The fift way by which men seeke their owne, is by seeking to haue <MILESTONE N="5"/>
their wils,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 6. 8.</NOTE> as the wrong doers in <HI>Corinth,</HI> who thought it not enough
to doe wrong and harme to their brethren, but to haue their wills
enough of them, drew them before the Heathen Magistrates.</P>
<P>And truely, some men are so Prince-like, or rather Papall, that
their very will and word is become a law, and if they haue said it,
it must be so, els there is no rest nor quietnesse to be had, let neuer
so many reasons be brought to the contrary, its but fighting with
the winde. They are like the obstinate <HI>Iewes,</HI> who, when against
Gods law &amp; reason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 8. 19.</NOTE> they had asked a King, though <HI>Samuel</HI> shewed
them that it would turne in the end to their owne smart, yet still
held the conclusion, and sayd, nay, <HI>But we will haue a King.</HI>
Thus men are caught by their owne words, and insnared by the
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
straitnes of their owne hearts, and it is death to them not to haue
their wils,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 King. 19. 2.</NOTE> and howsoeuer sometimes (like <HI>Iezabell)</HI> they are cut
short of their purposes, yet selfe-willed men will strout and swell
like <HI>Absolon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 13. 22.</NOTE> saying neither <HI>good nor bad,</HI> but hope for the day, and
threaten like prophane <HI>Esall:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 27. 41.</NOTE> Now the contrary is seene in <HI>Dauid,</HI>
though a Prince, a Captaine, a Warriour, who hauing sayd, yea,
sworne, that he would kill <HI>Naball,</HI> and all his family that day, yet vp∣on
reasonable counsell giuen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 25. 34.</NOTE> and that but by a weake woman, he
changed his minde, altered his purpose, and returned, without
striking one stroake, an example rare, and worthy imitation; and
when men are sicke of will, let them thinke of <HI>Dauid,</HI> it was his
grace and honour to goe backe from his word and practise, when
reason came;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 14. 8. 9.</NOTE> So was it <HI>Herods</HI> disgrace and shame to hold his word
and will against reason and conscience.</P>
<P>But some man happily will say vnto me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quest.</NOTE> It is true, that men seeke
their owne by all these wayes, But what should be the reason and
cause of this? that men seeke so earnestly themselues, in seeking ri∣ches,
honour, ease, belly-cheare, will, &amp;c. something there is that
carrieth them.</P>
<P>True, and the reasons and causes are specially these three;</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Resp.</NOTE> pride and high conceitednes, when men ouer-value them∣selues:
And this made <HI>Absolon</HI> to seeke his Fathers kingdome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 1.</NOTE> be∣cause
he thought himselfe worthy of it.:<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 15. 4.</NOTE> This made <HI>Haman</HI> so sore
vexed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hest. 3. 5.</NOTE> because <HI>Mordecai</HI> bowed not to him, because he highly va∣lued
himselfe.</P>
<P>And surely, that which a man valueth at much, he giueth much re∣spect
to, and so it is a sure signe that a man loues himselfe most
when he giueth most to himselfe, and some intollerable proud per∣sons
euen thinke all the world is for them, and all their purposes
and endeuours shew what a large conceit they haue of themselues.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 2.</NOTE> want of due consideration and valuation of other
mens endowments, abilities, and deserts, when men passe those
things by,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 40. 23.</NOTE> though they haue both seene, heard, and felt them, as
<HI>Pharaohs</HI> Butler forgat <HI>Iosephs</HI> eminency when he was restored to his
place, so men vse to write their owne good actions in Brasse, but o∣ther
mens in Ashes, neuer remembring nor considering the paynes,
labour, good properties, &amp;c. which others haue, and so they haue
no loue to them, but onely to themselues; as if God had made all
other men vnreasonable Beasts, and them onely reasonable men.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 3.</NOTE> want of a heauenly conuersation, and spirituall eye to
behold the glory, greatnesse, and maiestie, and goodnesse of God,
as the Queene of <HI>Sheba</HI> thought highly of her own glory, wisedome,
and happinesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 King. 10. 7. 8</NOTE> till she saw <HI>Salomons</HI> wisedome and glory, and then
she cryed out, not of the happinesse of her owne seruants, but of his
seruants that stood before him; and verily, if men were conuersant
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
Courtiers in heauen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 11. 33.</NOTE> they would cry out with <HI>Paul, Oh the deepnesse
of the riches, wisedome, and knowledge of God, &amp;c.</HI> and would be asha∣med
of their owne sinfulnesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Similies.</NOTE> nakednesse, and misery; for, as coun∣try
men which neuer saw the state of Cities, nor the glory of courts,
admire euen their owne countrey orders: And as the Sauages here
which are clad in skinnes, and creepe in woods and holes, thinke
their owne brutish and inhumane life the best, which if they saw and
did rightly apprehend the benefit of comely humanity, the sweetnes
of Religion, and the seruice of God, they would euen shamefully
hide themselues from the eye of all noble Christians.</P>
<P>Euen so, if men in serious contemplation, by the eye of faith,
would behold the glory of God, and what great riches, beautie,
fulnesse, perfection, power, dignitie, and greatnesse is in God, they
would leaue admiring of themselues, and seeking of themselues, and
would say with <HI>Dauid,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 7. 18.</NOTE> <HI>What am I? And what is my Fathers house?
that thou shouldest thus blesse me?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 8. 3.</NOTE> Yea, <HI>What is man? or the sonne of
man that thou so regardest him?</HI></P>
<P>But it is time that we now come to apply these things more par∣ticularly
to our selues, and see what vse is to be made of them.</P>
<P>Is it so that God seeth a proannes in all the sonnes of <HI>Adam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vse 1.</NOTE> to
seeke themselues too much, and hath giuen them warnings and
watch words thereof, as we haue heard, and doth experience con∣firme
it? Then hence are reproued a number of men, who thinke
they can neuer shew loue enough to themselues, nor seeke their own
enough, but thinke all cost, charges, cheerishing, prayse, honour, &amp;c.
too little for them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 16. 22.</NOTE> and no man needeth say to them, as <HI>Peter</HI> did to
Christ, <HI>fauour thy selfe,</HI> but if they doe a little for another man, they
account it a great matter, though it be but a morsell of bread, or a
single penny; but no varieties of dainties is too good for them, no
silke, purple, cloth, or stuffe is too good to cloth them, the poore
mans idlenesse and ill husbandry is oft throwne in his dish, but their
owne carnall delights and fleshly wantonnesse is neuer thought vp∣on:
and why? Because they thinke euen God and man owes all to
them, but they owe nothing to none. Why, thou foolish and besot∣ted
man, hath not the holy Ghost read it in the face of euery sonne
of <HI>Adam,</HI> that he is too apt to seeke his owne, and art thou wiser
then God, to thinke thou neuer seekest thine owne enough? or
dreamest thou that thou art made of other, and better mettall then
other men are? Surely, I know no way to escape, hauing of corrup∣tion
to thy Father, and the worme to thy sister and brother. And if
God had any where in all the Scriptures sayd, loue thy selfe, make
much of thy selfe, prouide for one, &amp;c. there were some reason for
thee to take vp the Nigards Prouerbs, <HI>Euery man for himselfe, and
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
God for vs all; Charitie beginneth at home, &amp;c.</HI> But God neuer taught
thee these things; No, they are Sathans positions: Doth God euer
commend a man for carnall loue of himselfe?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 13. 14.</NOTE> Nay, he brands it, and
disgraceth it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 3. 4.</NOTE> as <HI>selfe-loue; taking thought for the flesh; louing of plea∣sure,
&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>It is a point of good naturall policie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Obiect.</NOTE> for a man to care and pro∣uide
for himselfe.</P>
<P>Then the most fooles haue most naturall policie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Resp.</NOTE> for see you not
the greatest droanes and nouices, either in Church, or Common-wealth,
to be the greatest scratchers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 73. 5. 7.</NOTE> and scrapers, and gatherers of
riches? Are they not also, for the most part, best fed and clad? and
liue they not most easily? What shall I say? Euen hoggs, doggs, and
bruit Beasts know their own ease, and can seeke that which is good
for themselues; And what doth this shifting, progging, and fat feed∣ing
which some vse, more resemble any thing then the fashion of
hoggs? and so let it be what naturall policie it will.</P>
<P>If God see this disease of selfe-loue so dangerous in vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vse 2.</NOTE> then it
standeth vs all in hand to suspect our selues, and so to seeke out the
roote of this disease, that it may be cured. If a learned Physitian,
shall see by our countenance and eye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Simile.</NOTE> that we haue some dangerous
disease growing on vs, our hearts will smite vs, and we will bethinke
our selues, where the most griefe lieth, and how it should come,
whether with cold, heate, surfeit, ouer-flowing of bloud, or thorow
griefe, melancholy, or any such way, and euery man will bestirre
himselfe to get rid of it, and will preuent all wayes that feed the dis∣ease,
and cherish all courses that would destroy it.</P>
<P>Now, how much more ought we to bestirre our selues, for this
matter of selfe-loue, since God himselfe hath cast all our waters,
and felt all our pulses, and pronounced vs all dangerously sicke of
this disease? beleeue it, God cannot lie, nor be deceiued; He that
made the heart, doth not he know it? Let euery mans heart smite
him, and let him fall to examination of himselfe, and see first, whe∣ther
he loue not riches and worldly wealth too much, whether his
heart be not too iocand at the comming of it in, and too heauie at
the going of it out, for if you find it so, there is great danger; if thou
canst not buy as if thou possessedst not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 7. 30. 31.</NOTE> and vse this world as thou
vsedst it not, thou art sicke and haddest need to looke to it. So, if
thou louest thine ease and pleasure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob 2. 10.</NOTE> see whether thou canst be con∣tent
to receiue at Gods hands euill as well as good; whether thou
haue learned as well to abound as to want,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 4. 10.</NOTE> as well to endure hard
labour, as to liue at ease; and art as willing to goe to the house of
mourning as to the house of mirth;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Edele 7. 6.</NOTE> for, els, out of doubt, thou louest
thy carnall pleasure and ease too much.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10"/>
Againe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. 1. 15.</NOTE> see whether thine heart cannot be as merry, and thy mind
as ioyfull, and thy countenance as cheerefull, with course fare, with
poulse, with bread and water (if God offer thee no better, nor the
times afford other) as if thou hadst great dainties: So also whether
thou canst be content as well with the scornes of men, when thou
hast done well, as with their prayses, so if thou canst with comfort
and good conscience say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 4. 3.</NOTE> I passe little for mans iudgement, whether
thou canst doe thy duety that God requireth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 12. 2.</NOTE> and despise the shame,
referring thy selfe vnto God, for if thou be dishartned, discouraged,
and weakened in any duety because of mens disprayses, its a signe
thou louest thy selfe too much.</P>
<P>So for the will,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 25. 34.</NOTE> if thou canst be content to giue way euen from
that which thou hast sayd shalbe, yea vowed shalbe, when better rea∣son
commeth, and hast that reuerence of other men, as that when
it standeth but vpon a matter of will, thou art as willing their wils
shall stand as thine, and art not sad, churlish, or discontent, but
cheerefull in thine heart,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 King. 21. 4.</NOTE> though thy will be crossed, it is a good signe,
but if not, thou art sicke of a selfe will, and must purge it out. I the
rather presse these things, because I see many men both wise and re∣ligious,
which yet are so tainted with this pestilent selfe-loue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccle. 10. 1.</NOTE> as that
it is in them euen as a dead slie to the Apothecaries ointment, spoy∣ling
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fficacie of all their graces, making their liues vncomfor∣table
to themselues, and vnprofitable to others, being neither fit for
Church nor common wealth, but haue euen their very soules in ha∣zard
thereby, and therefore who can say too much against it?</P>
<P>It is reported,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A faire warning.</NOTE> that there are many men gone to that other Plan∣tation
in <HI>Virginia,</HI> which, whilest they liued in England, seemed very
religious, zealous, and conscionable; and haue now lost euen the
sap of grace, and edge to all goodnesse; and are become meere
worldlings: This testimonie I beleeue to be partly true, and amongst
many causes of it, this selfe-loue is not the least; It is indeede a mat∣ter
of some commendations for a man to remoue himselfe out of a
thronged place into a wide wildernesse; to take in hand so long and
dangerous a iourney, to be an instrument to carry the Gospell and
humanitie among the bruitish heathen; but there may be many
goodly shewes and gloses and yet a pad in the strawe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 78. 5. 7.</NOTE> men may
make a great appearance of respect vnto God, and yet but dis∣semble
with him, hauing their owne lusts carying them: and, out of
doubt, men that haue taken in hand hither to come, out of discōtent∣ment,
in regard of their estates in England; and ayming at great mat∣ters
heere, affecting it to be Gentlemen, landed men, or hoping for
office, place, dignitie, or fleshly liberty; let the shew be what it will,
he substance is nought, and that bird of selfe-loue which was hat∣ched
at home, if it be not looked to, will eate out the life of all grace
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
and goodnesse: and though men haue escaped the danger of the
sea, and that cruell mortalitie, which swept away so many of our lo∣uing
friends and brethren; yet except they purge out this selfe-loue,
a worse mischeife is prepared for them: And who knoweth whe∣ther
God in mercy haue deliuered those iust men which heere depar∣ted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isa. 57. 1.</NOTE>
from the euils to come; and from vnreasonable men, in whom
there neither was, nor is, any comfort but greife, sorrow, affliction,
and miserie, till they cast out this spaune of selfe-loue.</P>
<P>But I haue dwelt too long vpon this first part; I come now to
the second, which concernes an Exhortation, as I shewed you, in
the Diuision.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>But euery man anothers wealth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Text.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>IN direct opposition, he should say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Expli.</NOTE> <HI>Let euery man seeke anothers,</HI> but
the first part being compared with the latter, and <HI>(seeke)</HI> being ta∣ken
out of the former and put to the latter, and <HI>(wealth)</HI> taken out
or rather implied, in the former, the whole sentence is thus resolued,
<HI>Let no man seeke his owne wealth, but let euery man seeke anothers
wealth.</HI></P>
<P>And the word here tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nslated <HI>wealth,</HI> is the same with that in <HI>Rom.</HI>
13. 4. and may not be taken onely for riches, as English-men com∣monly
vnderstand it, but for all kind of benefits, fauours, comforts,
either for soule or body; and so here againe, as before, you must vn∣derstand
an Affirmatiue Commandement, as the Negatiue was be∣fore:
and least any should say, If I may not seeke my owne good, I
may doe nothing; Yes, sayth <HI>Paul,</HI> Ile tell thee, thou shalt seeke the
good of another, whereas now all thy seeking helps but one, by this
meanes thou shalt helpe many: and this is further enforced by these
two circumstances, (no man) may seeke his owne, be he rich, lear∣ned,
wise, &amp;c. <HI>But euery man must seeke the good of another.</HI></P>
<P>The point of instruction is taken from the very letter and phrase,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doct. 2.</NOTE>
<HI>viz.</HI> A man must seeke the good, the wealth, the profit of others,
I say, he must seeke it, he must seeke the comfort, profit, and bene∣fit
of his neighbour, brother, associate, &amp;c. His owne good he need
not seeke, it will offer it selfe to him euery houre, but the good of
others must be sought, a man must not stay from doing good to o∣thers
till he is sought vnto, pulled and haled (as it were) like the vn∣iust
Iudge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 18. 5.</NOTE> for euery benefit that is first craued, commeth too late.
And thus the auncient Patriarkes did practise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 19. 1. 2.</NOTE> when the trauayler
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
and way-faring man came by, they did not tarry till they came and
asked reliefe and refreshing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iudg. 19. 20. 21.</NOTE> but sat at the gates to watch for such,
and looked in the streets to find them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iob 31. 32.</NOTE> yea, set open their doores
that they might freely and boldly enter in. And howsoeuer, some may
thinke this too large a practise, since, now the world is so full of peo∣ple,
yet I see not but the more people there is, the larger charitie
ought to be.</P>
<P>But be it so as a man may neglect, in some sort the generall world,
yet those to whom he is bound, either in naturall, ciuill, or religious
bands, them he must seeke how to doe them good: A notable exam∣ple
you haue in <HI>Dauid,</HI> who, because there was twixt him &amp; <HI>Ionathan</HI>
a band and couenant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 9. 1.</NOTE> therefore he enquired, <HI>Whether there was any
left of the house of Saul, to whom he might shew mercy for Ionathans sake;</HI>
So, this people of <HI>Corinth,</HI> to whom <HI>Paul</HI> writeth, they were in a
spirituall league and couenant in the <HI>Gospell,</HI> and so were a body;
Now for one member in the body to seeke himselfe, and neglect
all other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 12. 27.</NOTE> were, as if a man should cloth one arme or one leg of his
body with gold and purple, and let all the rest of the members goe
naked.</P>
<P>Now brethren, I pray you, remember your selues, and know, that
you are not in a retired Monasticall course, but haue giuen your
names and promises one to another, and couenanted here to cleaue
together in the seruice of God, and the King; What then must you
doe? May you liue as retired Hermites? and looke after no body?
Nay, you must seeke still the wealth of one another; And enquire
as <HI>Dauid,</HI> how liueth such a man? How is he clad? How is he fed?
He is my brother, my associate; we ventered our liues together here,
and had a hard brunt of it, and we are in league together, is his la∣bour
harder then mine? surely, I will ease him; hath he no bed to
lie on? why, I haue two, Ile lend him one; hath he no apparel? why,
I haue two suits, Ile giue him one of them; eates he course fare,
bread and water, and I haue better? why, surely we will part stakes:
He is as good a man as I, and we are bound each to other, so that his
w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nts must be my wants, his sorrowes my sorrowes, his sicknes my
sicknes, and his welfare my welfare, for I am as he is. And such a
sweet sympathie were excellent, comfortable, yea, heauenly, and is
the onely maker and conseruer of Churches and common-wealths,
and where this is wanting, ruine comes on quickly, as it did here in
<HI>Corinth.</HI></P>
<P>But besides these motiues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons. 1.</NOTE> there are other reasons to prouoke vs
not onely to doe good one to another; but euen to seeke and search
how to doe it.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="12"/>
As first, to maintaine modestie in all our associates, that of hun∣grie
wanters they become not bold beggers and impudent crauers,
for as one sayth of women, that, when they haue lost their shamefast∣nes,
they haue lost halfe their honestie, so may it truely be sayd of
a man, that when he hath lost his modestie, and puts on a begging
face, he hath lost his maiestie, and the Image of that noble creature,
and man should not begge and craue of man but onely of God; true
it is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn 4. 5.</NOTE> that as Christ was faine to craue water of the Samaritan wo∣man,
so men are forced to aske sometimes rather then starue, but
indeede in all societies it should be offered them, men often com∣plaine
of mens boldnes in asking, but how commeth this to passe,
but because the world hath beene so full of selfe-louers, as no man
would offer their money, meate, garmentes, though they saw
men hungrie, harborlesse, poore, and naked in the streetes; and
what is it that makes men brazen faced, bold, bruitish, tumul∣tuous,
mutinous, but because they are pinched with want, and see
others of their Companions (which it may be haue lesse deserued)
to liue in prosperitie and pleasure?</P>
<P>It wonderfully encourageth men in their dueties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Reason.</NOTE> when they
see the burthen equally borne; but when some withdraw themselues
and retire to their owne particular ease, pleasure, or profit; what
heart can men haue to goe on in their businesse? when men are come
together, to lift some weighty peece of tymber or vessell; if one
stand still and doe not lift, shall not the rest be weakned and dishart∣ned?
will not a few idle droanes spoyle the whole stocke of labo∣rious
Bees: so one idle belly, one murmurer, one complainer, one
selfe-louer will weaken and disharten a whole Colonie. Great mat∣ters
haue beene brought to passe, where men haue cheerefully as
with one heart, hand, and shoulder, gone about it both in warres,
buildings, and plantations, but where euery man seekes himselfe, all
commeth to nothing.</P>
<P>The present necessitie requireth it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Reason.</NOTE> as it did in the dayes of the
<HI>Iewes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Neh. 5.</NOTE> returning from captiuitie, and as it was here in <HI>Corinth.</HI> The
Countrey is yet raw, the land vntilled, the Cities not builded, the
Cattell not setled, we are compassed about with a helplesse and idle
people, the natiues of the Countrey, which cannot in any comely
or comfortable manner helpe themselues, much lesse vs. Wee also
haue beene very chargeable to many of our louing friends, which
helped vs hither, and now againe supplyed vs, so that before we
thinke of gathering riches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 30. 26. 31.</NOTE> we must euen in Conscience thinke of
requiting their charge, loue, and labour, and cursed be that profit
and gaine which aymeth not at this. Besides, how many of our deare
friends, did here die at our first entrance, many of them no doubt
for want of good lodging, shelter, and comfortable things, and ma∣ny
<PB N="15" REF="12"/>
more may goe after them quickly, if care be not taken. Is this
then a time for men to begin to seeke themselues?<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 3. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Paul</HI> sayth, that
men in the last dayes shall be louers of themselues, but it is here yet
but the first dayes, and (as it were) the dawning of this new world,
it is now therefore no time for men to looke to get riches, braue
clothes, daintie fare, but to looke to present necessities; it is now
no time to pamper the flesh, liue at ease, snatch, catch, scrape, and
pill, and hoord vp, but rather to open the doores, the chests, and
vessels, and say, brother, neighbour, friend, what want yee, any
thing that I haue? make bold with it, it is yours to command, to doe
you good, to comfort and cheerish you, and glad I am that I haue
it for you.</P>
<P>And euen the example of God himselfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 Reason.</NOTE> whom we should follow
in all things within our power and capacitie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ephes. 5. 1.</NOTE> may teach vs this les∣son,
for (with reuerence to his Maiestie be it spoken) he might
haue kept all grace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 1. 16.</NOTE> goodnesse, and glory to himselfe, but he hath
communicated it to vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 113. 6. 7.</NOTE> euen as farre as we are capable of it in this
life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 4. 5.</NOTE> and will communicate his glory in all fulnesse with his Elect
in that life to come;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioh. 17. 22.</NOTE> euen so his Sonne Christ Iesus left his glo∣ry
eclipsed for a time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And 15. 13.</NOTE> and abased himselfe to a poore and distres∣sed
life in this world, that he might, by it, bring vs to happinesse in
the world to come. If God then haue delighted in this doing good
and relieuing frayle and miserable man, so farre inferior to himselfe,
what delight ought man to haue to relieue and comfort man, which
is equall to himselfe?</P>
<P>Euen as we deale with others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5 Reason.</NOTE> our selues and others shall be dealt
withall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iudg. 1. 6. 7.</NOTE> carest thou not how others fare, how they toile, are grieued,
sicke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 7. 2.</NOTE> pinched, cold, harborlesle, so as thou be in health, liuest at
ease, warme in thy nest, farest well? The dayes will come when thou
shalt labour and none shall pittie thee, be poore and none relieue
thee, be sicke, and lie and die and none visit thee, yea, and thy chil∣dren
shall lie and statue in the streets, and none shall relieue them,
for <HI>it is the mercifull that shall obtaine mercy;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 5. 7.</NOTE> and <HI>the memory of the
Iust shall be blessed</HI> euen in his seede;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prou. 10.</NOTE> and a mercifull and louing
man when he dies, though he leaue his children small and desolate,
yet euery one is mercifully stirred vp for the Fathers sake to shew
compassion, but the vnkindnesse, currishnesse, and selfe-loue of a Fa∣ther,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. 21. 7. 8. 9.</NOTE>
is thorow Gods iust iudgement recompenced vpon the chil∣dren
with neglect and crueltie.</P>
<P>Lastly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 Reason.</NOTE> that we may draw to an end; A mercilesse man, and a
man without naturall affection or loue, is reckoned among such
as are giuen ouer of God to a reprobate minde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 1. 30.</NOTE> and (as it were)
transformed into a beast-like humor; for, what is a man if he be not
<PB N="16" REF="13"/>
sociable, kinde, affable, free hearted, liberall; He is a beast in the
shape of a man; or rather an infernall Spirit, walking amongst
men which makes the world a hell what in him lieth; for, it is e∣uen
a hell to liue where there are many such men: such the Scrip∣ture
calleth <HI>Nabals,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 14. 1.</NOTE> which signifieth <HI>fooles</HI> and decayed men, which
haue lost both the sap of grace and nature; and such merciles men
are called <HI>Goats,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 25. 33.</NOTE> and shall be set at Christs left hand at the last day;
<HI>Oh therefore seeke the wealth one of another.</HI></P>
<P>But some will say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Obiect.</NOTE> it is true, and it were well, if men would so doe,
but we see euery man is so for himselfe, as that if I should not doe
so, I should doe full ill, for if I haue it not of my owne, I may snap
short sometimes, for I see no body sheweth me any kindnesse, nor
giueth me any thing; if I haue gold and siluer, that goeth for pay∣ment,
and if I want it, I may lie in the streete, therefore I were best
keepe that I haue, and not be so liberall as you would haue me, except
I saw others would be so towards me.</P>
<P>This Obiection seemeth but equall and reasonable, as did the
Answere of <HI>Naball</HI> to <HI>Dauids</HI> men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Resp.</NOTE> but it is most foolish and car∣nall,
as his also was; for, if we should measure our courses by
most mens practises, a man should neuer doe any godly dutie;
for,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 13. 23. 24.</NOTE> doe not the most, yea, almost all, goe the broad way that lea∣deth
to death and damnation? who then will follow a multitude?
It is the word of God, and the examples of the best men that we
must follow. And what if others will doe nothing for thee, but
are vnkinde, and vnmercifull to thee? Knowest thou not that they
which will be the children of God must be kinde to the vnkinde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 5. 44. 47.</NOTE>
louing to their enemies, and blesse those that curse them? If all
men were kinde to thee, it were but <HI>Publicans</HI> right eousnesse to be
kinde to them; If all men be euill, wilt thou be so too? When
<HI>Dauid</HI> cryed out; <HI>Helpe Lord, for not a godly man is left.</HI> Did he him∣selfe
turne vngodly also?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 12. 1.</NOTE> Nay, he was rather the more strict: So,
if loue and charitie be departed out of this world, be thou one of
them that shall first bring it in againe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 12. 20.</NOTE></P>
<P>And let this be the first rule, which I will with two others con∣clude
for this time.</P>
<P>Neuer measure thy course by the most,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Rule.</NOTE> but by the best, yea, and
principally by Gods word; Looke not what others doe to thee,
but consider what thou art to doe to them; seeke to please God, not
thy selfe: did they in <HI>Mathew</HI> 25. 44. plead, that others did no∣thing
for them? No such matter, no such plea will stand before
God, his word is plaine to the contrary, therefore, though all
the world should neglect thee, disregard thee, and contemne
<PB N="17" REF="13"/>
thee, yet remember thou hast not to doe with men, but with the
highest God, and so thou must doe thy dutie to them notwithstan∣ding.</P>
<P>And let there be no Prodigall person to come forth and say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Rule.</NOTE>
Giue me the portion of lands and goods that appert<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ineth to me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 15. 12.</NOTE>
and let me shift for my selfe; It is you too soone to put men to their
shi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts; <HI>Israel</HI> was seauen yoares in <HI>Canaan,</HI> before the land was de∣uided
vnto Tribes, much longer, before it was deuided vnto Fa∣milies:
And why wouldest thou haue thy particular portion, but
because thou thinkest to liue better then thy neighbour, and scor∣nest
to liue so meanely as he? but who, I pray thee, brought this
particularizing first into the world?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Esay 14. 12. 13</NOTE> Did not Sathan, who was
not content to keepe that equall state with his fellowes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iude 6.</NOTE> but would
set his throne aboue the Starres?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 3. 5.</NOTE> Did not he also entise man to de∣spise
his generall felicitie and happinesse, and goe trie particular
knowledge of good and euill? And nothing in this world doth more
resemble heauenly happinesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 133. 1.</NOTE> then for men to liue as one, being of
one heart,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 4. 32.</NOTE> and one soule; neither any thing more resembles hel∣lish
horror, then for euery man to shift for himselfe; for if it be a
good minde and practise, thus to affect particulars, <HI>mine</HI> and
<HI>thine,</HI> then it should be best also for God to prouide one heauen for
thee, and another for thy neighbour.</P>
<P>But some will say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Obiect.</NOTE> if all men would doe their endeuour as I
doe, I could be content with this generalitie, but many are idle and
sloathful, and eate vp others labours, and therefore it is best to part,
and then euery man may doe his pleasure.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Resp.</NOTE> This, indeed, is the common plea of such as will endure
no inconueniences, and so for the hardnesse of mens hearts,
God and man doth often giue way to that which is not best,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 19. 8.</NOTE> nor
perpetuall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 8. 5.</NOTE> but indeede if wee take this course, to change ordi∣nances
and practises, because of inconueniences, wee shall haue,
euery day, new lawes.</P>
<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Thes. 3. 9.</NOTE> If others be idle, and thou diligent, thy fellowship,
prouocation, and example may well helpe to cure that maladie in
them, being together, but being asunder, shall they not be more
idle, and shall not <HI>Gentrie</HI> and <HI>Beggerie</HI> be quickly the glorious En∣signes
of your Common-wealth?</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 1. 29.</NOTE> Construe things in the best part, be not too hastie to
say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 30. 10. 24.</NOTE> men are idle and slouthfull, all men haue not strength, skill, fa∣cultie,
spirit, and courage to worke alike; it is thy glory and cre∣dit,
<PB N="18" REF="14"/>
that canst doe so well, and his shame and reproach, that
can doe no better; and are not these sufficient rewards to you
both?</P>
<P>Fourthly, if any be idle apparantly, you haue a Law and Go∣uernours
to execute the same, and to follow that rule of the A∣postle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 19. 38.</NOTE>
to keepe backe their bread, and let them not eate, goe not
therefore whisperingly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Thes. 3. 10.</NOTE> to charge men with idlenesse; but goe to
the Gouernour and proue them idle; and thou shalt see them haue
their deserts.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. 19. 15.</NOTE></P>
<P>And as you are a body together, so hang not together by skins
and gymocks, but labour to be ioynted together and knit by flesh
and synewes; away with enuie at the good of others, and reioyce
in his good,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 18. 9.</NOTE> and sorrow for his euill, let his ioy bee thy ioy, and
his sorrow thy sorrow:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 12. 19.</NOTE> let his sicknesse be thy sicknesse: his hunger
thy hunger: his pouertie thy pouertie: And if you professe friend∣ship,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro. 17. 17.</NOTE>
be friends in aduersities: for then a friend is knowne, and try∣ed,
and not before.</P>
<P>Lay away all thought of former thinges and forget them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Rule.</NOTE> and
thinke vpon the things that are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 42. 1.</NOTE> looke not gapingly one vpon o∣ther,
