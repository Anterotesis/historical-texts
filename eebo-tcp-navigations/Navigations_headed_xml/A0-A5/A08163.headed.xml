<HEAD>THE RELATION OF ALL THE LAST PASSAGES OF THE WARRES in the PALATINATE, <HI>And how both Armies haue</HI> disposed themselues vnto <HI>further Enterprises.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T was the happie counsell of <HI>Scipio,</HI> the Noble and vallorous <HI>Romane</HI> in the graue Senate, for the reco∣very of his lost coun∣try, not to continue a Defensiue Warre against <HI>Hanniball</HI> in <HI>Ita∣ly,</HI> but rather to passe with the Armie a∣gainst <HI>Carthage</HI> it selfe, the fountaine of their troubled Vexation, as that which would be a meanes, at least to draw their enemy from the gates of <HI>Rome</HI> into <HI>Affrica,</HI> to de∣fend
<PB N="2" REF="3"/> their owne Cittie of <HI>Carthage;</HI> Now of this advise he couragiously vndertooke the performance himselfe, at the com∣mand of the State of <HI>Rome;</HI> and performed it most succesfully, to the safetie of his Country; and his owne perpetuall ho∣nour.</P>
<P>If this pollicy of his hath oftentimes beene accounted worthy of imitation in the succeeding Ages; and alwayes to de∣serue acclamation and prayse; It is no strange matter, nor need we to distrust their courage, or their successe, who at this day follow that course of proceeding in their Warres, and therefore howsoever I doubt nothing at all, but that after the ioyning of <HI>Brunswicks</HI> Army with the Count <HI>Mansfeilds,</HI> they might haue oppo∣sed the Enemies in the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> if it had not tended to the vtter devastation of that poore Country, which hath langui∣shed so long vnder the miserable burthen of so great a Warre; yet for the preservati∣on of that remnant which is left, they haue now happily taken the way, to transport the warre, and consequently, the misery
<PB N="3" REF="3"/> of it, into the Enemies owne Country, that they also may not be onely spectators of others calamities, but may at length taste of the same Sauce they haue served others withall, by a forced contribution at least of such money, munition, and meanes as for such a populous Armie is requisite; of which its very probable, they had some wants, by reason of the disordered Disastar, which befell the <HI>Brunswickers</HI> in passing the River of <HI>Maine,</HI> where as its sayd, much Baggage was lost, and some men. Now, I say, for to furnish themselues againe with neces∣saries, and to reinforce their Armie, by some new supplyes from the <HI>Switzers,</HI> and other friends; haue they taken their way into <HI>Alsatia,</HI> and so proceed, as this fol∣lowing Relation doth amply declare.</P>
<P>From <HI>Frankendale,</HI> the 10. of Iuly, The Count <HI>Mansfeild</HI> after that he had ranso∣med divers Townes and places in <HI>Alsatia,</HI> where hee recovered a great Summe of Money, he layd siedge to a towne called <HI>Zanerice</HI> or <HI>Elsaszaberen,</HI> but it was so well provided that he prevailed not, but rai∣sed
<PB N="4" REF="4"/> the siedge, and marched away to∣wards <HI>Lorraine.</HI> Monsieur <HI>Tilly</HI> hearing of this, who lay before <HI>Heidelbergh,</HI> raised his siedge likewise, and so marched away in∣to <HI>Turlachs</HI> Countrey, with the most part of his Armie, having leaft onely 7. or 8, Thousand at <HI>Wimpfen:</HI> and <HI>Don Gonzalo</HI> with the Spanish Forces at <HI>Landenbergh,</HI> which lyeth now over against <HI>Wormes.</HI></P>
<P>It is sayd heere, That they were so brauely entertained by Syr <HI>Gerard Harbert</HI> Governor of the Castle, and by the garri∣son in the Towne, that they lost before <HI>Heidelbergh,</HI> aboue 1500. men.</P>
<P>It is thought that <HI>Tilly</HI> wil make a bridg at <HI>Wimpfen,</HI> some 3. Leagues off <HI>Heidelbergh,</HI> over the <HI>Necker,</HI> hee hath one already be∣low at <HI>Landenbergh:</HI> and that <HI>Don Gonzalo</HI> will make one over the Rhine aboue <HI>Wormes,</HI> and <HI>Tilly</HI> one aboue <HI>Spiers</HI> at <HI>Yden∣heim,</HI> to blocke vp all the three Townes at once.</P>
<P>My Lord Generall <HI>Vere,</HI> hath giuen or∣der to the Governour of <HI>Germersheim,</HI> to take possession of all the boates that hee possible can, and to burne them, that the
<PB N="5" REF="4"/> Enemy be not served with them, <HI>Turlach</HI> hath casseer'd his Armie, and is retyred to his Countrey, his Souldiers are vnder the commaund of the Barron of <HI>Helmstat,</HI> and entertayned by Generall <HI>Vere.</HI></P>
<P>Count <HI>Mansfeild</HI> hath sent backe one Regiment of foote, vnder <HI>Waldmanshansen,</HI> and 600. horse of <HI>Vbertrants</HI> band they are put in Garrison at <HI>Mainheim</HI> and <HI>Frankendale.</HI> In the sayd places, the Drum is dayly bea∣ten in his Maiesties name, to take vp soul∣diers.</P>
<P>From <HI>Pont</HI> a <HI>Mossen,</HI> in <HI>Lorraine,</HI> the 10. of Iuly, Count <HI>Mansfeild</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Brunswicke,</HI> haue demaunded passage of the Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> and obtayned it, so they are entered into <HI>Lorraine,</HI> and are now within 6. or 7. Leagues of this Towne, all the countrey flying with their goods, in∣to the Townes: Hee is strong 24000. men, what hee will doe is vnknowne as yet: all <HI>Lorraine</HI> is in Armes likewise, All <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and all <HI>Luzembergh,</HI> take Alarum: The King of <HI>France</HI> hath sent his Brother, with 2000. horse to the Fronters to keepe them.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<P>The King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> is in <HI>Selan,</HI> with his vncle.</P>
<P>From <HI>Brussels,</HI> the 13. of Iuly, The Go∣vernour of <HI>Bergen ap zoon,</HI> having received commandment from his Excellency, the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> to attend him with 2000 men of his Garrison, for accomplishment of some service in hand, was marching to∣wards him, but on the way had notice of the Enemies motion with great forces to∣wardes that Towne, to surprise it on the sodaine in his absence; whereupon ad∣vising well on the businesse, for hee stood in doubt, whether hee should proceede foreward according to the commaund which he had received from the Prince, for by that meanes he might hazard the towne &amp; expose it to the Enemies hands, if the report of their intention that wayes were true, or whether hee should retyre backe, for to safe guard the Towne: but so he might hinder the Execution of some exploit, which would be no lesse prejudi∣ciall to the State: but being confirmed in their resolution who hold it better, certain∣ly to saue that they haue in possession, thē
<PB N="7" REF="5"/> to adventure it, vpon an vncertaine hope of gaining more to it; hee made backe a∣gaine with all possible speede, and all lit∣tle enough, for about an houre after his entrance, the Enemy shewed himselfe be∣fore the Towne, and so haue proceeded very furiously in the siedge, and haue re∣ceived hitherto as valiant resistance, but beeing already twentie thousand strong, they looke for ten thousand more, with the Marquis <HI>Spinola,</HI> who arrived here the leventh of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uly</HI> at night, from <HI>Wezell,</HI> or <HI>Lyn∣berch,</HI> he is to depart againe to day to his men, who haue alreadie besieged <HI>Bergen ap Zoon,</HI> and doe entrench themselues; There are within twentie two Companies, that defend it brauely, and no doubt shall be releeved by the <HI>States.</HI></P>
