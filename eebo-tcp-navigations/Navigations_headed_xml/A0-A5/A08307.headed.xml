<HEAD>The Discription of <HI>Hartfordshire.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HARTFORDSHIRE taketh<NOTE PLACE="marg">The deno∣mination of the Shire.</NOTE> name of the Towne called HARTFORDE and the Towne of the passage ouer the Riuer.</P>
<P>The passage as (M. <HI>Camden</HI> sup∣poseth) is HERVDFORDE, <HI>Vadum rubrum.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vadum cer∣uinum.</NOTE></P>
<P>It may be also, both consonant to the sounde and to the nature and scituation of the place, <HI>vadum ceruinum.</HI> THE PASSAGE OF DEERE of that kinde whereof the chiefe males were eal∣led <HI>Hartes,</HI> in former ages: at this day Stagges. The disposition of this part of the countrie, to forrest and weldish groundes, fitte for the fostering of such kinde of wilde beastes, doth much more argue it to be HARTESFORDE, then HERVD, for THE RVDFORD. As I coniecture.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Harting∣fordberye.</NOTE></P>
<P>Moreouer, not farre from the towne, is a place called HAR∣TINGFORD, which signifieth <HI>vadumad ceruinum pratum,</HI> or <HI>ad ceruinum pascuum.</HI></P>
<P>This Shire was part of that countrey where <HI>Ptolomey</HI> placed the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cattieuctani</NOTE> <HI>Cattieuctani:</HI> who possessed the greatest part of this <HI>Buckingham</HI> and <HI>Bedfordshires.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Situs.</NOTE></P>
<P>It hath on the East <HI>Essex,</HI> on the north <HI>Cambridshire</HI> and <HI>Bedford∣shire,</HI> West and South <HI>Buckinghamshire</HI> and <HI>Middlesexe.</HI></P>
<P>As touching vicecountile iurisdiction, before and long after the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sometime annexed vnto <HI>Essex,</HI> </NOTE> time of Edw. 3. it was annexed to <HI>Essex.</HI> And one Sheriffe supplied both Countics, as did also one Eschetor.</P>
<P>Concerning the Soyle:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Soyle.</NOTE> It is for the most part, chalkie, though the vpper cruste in the South and West parts, be for the most part of redde earth mixed with grauell, which yet by reason of the white marle vnder it, yeeldeth good wheat and oates: But of it owne nature most enclined to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood, and coupisses, affording also faire wayes. In the North part of the Shire, as in the hundreds of <HI>Hitche,</HI> and <HI>Oddesey,</HI> the soyle is very apt to yeeld corne, and dertie wayes, especially that part which is accompted parcell of a vayle
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
called of the countrie men the <HI>vayle</HI> of <HI>Ring-tayle</HI> or <HI>Wring-tayle</HI> or<NOTE PLACE="marg">The vayle of Ringtayle.</NOTE> rather <HI>Ringdale,</HI> which extendeth it selfe also into <HI>Cambridg-shire.</HI> And affordeth no small store of wheat and malte towards the pro∣uision of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>This Shire at this day is, and more hath beene heretofore, much repleat with parkes woodes and riuers. But for deepe feedinges or<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parkes, woods &amp; riuers. Sheepe pa∣stures. Meadowes.</NOTE> large sheepe pastures, I could take notice of fewe, and they especi∣ally about KNEBWORTH the best sheepe gates within the Shire,</P>
<P>Meadowes here and there, are dispersed vpon the riuers sides: But many of them colde and mossye, especially about RICK∣MANSWORTH. The LEA challengeth the commenda∣tion for the best meadowes, the North parte of the Shire is much vnfurnished.</P>
<P>To speake of the Soyle as in deede it is most generally, for my part I take it but a barraine countrie, in respecte of some other<NOTE PLACE="marg">The soyle most gene∣rally bar∣raine. <HI>Thorrow∣fares</HI> the cause of good mar∣kets.</NOTE> Shires, without the industrious toyle &amp; charge of the thirstie hus∣bandman.</P>
<P>It is much benefited by thorrow fares to and from <HI>London</HI> North∣wardes, and that maketh the markets to bee the better furnished with such necessaries, as are requisite for Innes, for th'intertaine∣ment of trauaylers. And I take it (though it be one of the least) no one Shire in England for the quantitie commes neere it for tho∣row-fare places of competent receit.</P>
<P>The ayre for the most partis very salutarie, and in regard there∣of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ayre.</NOTE> many sweete and pleasant dwellinges, healthfull by nature and profitable by arte and industrie are planted there: And aboue o∣ther Shires there are many auncient Sites, houses in former ages famous, commonly called BERYES, which are in other Shires<NOTE PLACE="marg">Berryes.</NOTE> called <HI>Halls, Courte-houses,</HI> and <HI>Mannorplaces.</HI> The most part of these BERRYES are Mannors or Lordshippes of themselues, the worde BERRYE <HI>sodem significat:</HI> a dwelling place or place of<NOTE PLACE="marg">BERRY <HI>quid.</HI></NOTE> aboad, <HI>inde Connie beryes,</HI> a refuge for Connyes.</P>
<P>But the worde <HI>Berye</HI> is often confounded with <HI>Burrough, Burye</HI> and <HI>Berge:</HI> euery of which haue their distinct significations: BVRROW<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Berye</HI> often confoun∣ded. <HI>Borrough, Burye, Berge,</HI> quid <HI>Beryes</HI> why decayed. The diuisi∣on of the Shire into hundreds.</NOTE> <HI>oppidem:</HI> BVRYE, <HI>sepulchrum:</HI> BERG, <HI>montem significat:</HI> And BERYE sometime is taken <HI>pro castro▪ et exercitus castrametatione.</HI> And therefore in regard of the antiquitie of these <HI>Beryes,</HI> I thought it not superfluous, to obserue the most of name, and to insert them in the Mappe, though now they carrie not equall glorie in outward shewe, with som of inferiour condition: for the most part of them hauing lost their auncient Lords, or the Lords let them for so loftie rentes, as that they are sackt of their antique royalties, and bereft of their former beautie.</P>
<P>This Shire is deuided into 7. hundreds and ½ namely:</P>
<P>ODDESEY hundred, which taketh name of an auncient
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
house called ODDESEY GRAVNGE which standeth<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oddesey.</NOTE> neere old WATLINE-STREET, and abutteth parte on <HI>Bed∣fordshire,</HI> and part on <HI>Cambridgshire,</HI> and aboundeth especially with corne.</P>
<P>EDWINESTRE hundred bordereth vpon Essex.</P>
<P>BRAWGHING hundred taketh name of a parishe of that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Edwinestree. Brawghing. Hartford.</NOTE> name, and boundeth vpon <HI>Edwinestree.</HI></P>
<P>HARTFORD hundred is named of <HI>Hartford</HI> the prouincial towne of the Shire.</P>
<P>BROADWATER hundred, so tearmed of a little hamlet<NOTE PLACE="marg">Broadwater</NOTE> of 2. or 3. houses neere Steuen edge.</P>
<P>COISHOO hundred, or CAEGSHOO, is named of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caishoo Cassij.</NOTE> an anncient Berye, called <HI>Caishoo-berye, de</HI> CASSIIS of a people mentioned by <HI>Caesar</HI> resident in this hundred as <HI>M. Camden</HI> affir∣meth. <HI>See more of this vnder that name in the table of parishes.</HI></P>
<P>DACORVM hundred, (as I am out of doubt) <HI>de Dacis</HI> of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dacorum.</NOTE> <HI>Danes,</HI> who in this hundred, after many spoiles committed by them were ouerthrowne by <HI>Adelnulph,</HI> and Adelbalde his sonne about the yeere of Christ 8 29. And in memoriall of their ouerthrow, and stoppe of their further passage that way at that time, the place where the fight was is to this day called DANE ENDE <HI>Daco∣rum clades.</HI> And neere it in the highway towardes <HI>Steuen edge,</HI> are<NOTE PLACE="marg">DACO∣RVM cla∣des. Hitch.</NOTE> many burials, great heapes of earth, vnder which are enterred, such as were slaine, at that conflict as may be supposed.</P>
<P>HITCH halfe hundred, so called of a wood called HITCH∣WOOD, and not of <HI>Hitchin</HI> towne, which indeed is HITCH∣ENDE, <HI>terminus de Hitch,</HI> and not <HI>Hitch-ing,</HI> as it is corruptly tear∣med, and the hundred is HITCH-HAVLFE <HI>hundred</HI> not <HI>Hitchnie</HI> nor <HI>Hitching haulfe hundred.</HI></P>

<P>Some, as I take it in tearming this <HI>Stort</HI> the STOVR are not<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stour.</NOTE> meerely mistaken, for though the <HI>Stowrē</HI> parteth <HI>Suffolke</HI> and <HI>Essex,</HI> and riseth at STOVR-MER, the <HI>Stort</HI> riseth in <HI>Essex</HI> also neere WENDON LOWGHES and signifieth <HI>Wendod water,</HI> and beginnes to deuide the two Shires betweene <HI>Stortford</HI> and <HI>Fernham</HI> about a mile aboue <HI>Stortford:</HI> And may in deede not amisse be cal∣led <HI>Stowret,</HI> THE LESSER OR LITTLE STOWR.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stowret.</NOTE> And the passage ouer the riuer neere <HI>Waymore Castle</HI> is called STOWRETFORD, briefely STORTFORD, whereof the Towne taketh name, and is called STORTFORD for <HI>Stow∣retsord.</HI> And vnder the name of the <HI>Stowret</HI> or <HI>Stort,</HI> it maintaineth<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stowretford.</NOTE> that deuision, till it come beneath an auncient house called the REE, where it meeteth with the LEA or LAVE, who as the<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Ree.</HI></NOTE> more worthie bereaues the little <HI>Stort</HI> of her title and glorie, and vnder the name of the <HI>Lea,</HI> they both in one hasten to WALT∣HAM ABBEY, and there bidde HARTFORDSHIRE <HI>vale,</HI> continuing her most milde course as stickler betweene <HI>Essex</HI> and <HI>Middlesex,</HI> vntill she present her selfe to famous <HI>Thames.</HI></P>
<P>The LEA is the most famous Riuer within this Shire: And<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lea.</NOTE> bringeth as it were a testimoniall of her worh from the <HI>Saxons,</HI> who entitled her LIGEAN or LIGEAM Lea water.

The Towne is said to be buil∣ded in the place where <HI>Alban</HI> was martyred, namely vpon a hill in a wood called HOLMEHVRST of <HI>Beda</HI> DOVRS∣WALDT: which is the wood neere the water, meaning the great Stagne, which was betweene <HI>Verlame</HI> and the place of <HI>Alban</HI> exe∣cution. <HI>Alban</HI> was a Cittizen of <HI>Verolame,</HI> and by bloud a Romane, and gaue entertainement to <HI>Amphibal</HI> at his comming to that citie. by whom he was from Paganisme conuerted to the Christian faith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Capgraue.</NOTE> for which he suffered as <HI>Capgraue</HI> affirmeth, whose further friuo∣lous reportes of the miracles wrought by this holy Conuert, liuing and dead, I leaue as idle or needelesse▪ onely it seemeth probable that such a man there was executed at that place, and for his eter∣nall commemoration, this <HI>Albans</HI> Monasterie was founded, and consequently the towne, both consecrate to his owne name. And endowed with many large priuiledges and dayly augmented and successiuely confirmed, by the charters of many Kings of this Land<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kings auncient confirmati∣on of char∣ters.

<P>This Monasterie hath bene enlarged by sundrie Abbots of this place, as especially by <HI>Eldred</HI> and <HI>Edmer</HI> about <HI>Eadgars</HI> time, and in <HI>Edward</HI> 3. time, who gaue the then Abbot <HI>Licentiam ad confirmardam et kernellandam Abathiam de calce et petra:</HI> in the 31. yeere of his raigne ouer England, and of his raigne ouer Fraunce the 18.</P>
<P>Such were the priuiledges of this place, that the King coulde make no secular officer ouer them, but by their owne consent.</P>
<P>They were acquitted of all <HI>Toll</HI> through England.</P>
<P>They made Iustices <HI>ad audiendum et terminandum,</HI> within them∣selues,
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
and no other Iustice could call them for any matter out of their libertie.</P>
<P>They made also Bayliffes and Corroners.</P>
<P>No Bishoppe had any Iurisdiction to correct any person among them for any matter spirituall or temporall.</P>
<P>They had the execution and returne of all writs, and the goodes of all Outlawes: and that is yet continued to the Towne by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Present Priuiledges of the town</NOTE> graunt of <HI>Edward</HI> 6. And no man may bee impanelled out of the Towne.</P>
<P>They had gayle and gayle deliuerie within the towne: and the towne at this day hath the like, namely one gayle for the libertie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gayle and gayle deliuerie.

<P>The towne is gouerned by a Maior and 10. Burgesses, a stewarde and a Chamberlaine.</P>
<P>There are in the towne 4. Wards and in euery Ward a Constable and 2. Churchwardens.</P>
<P>In the Abbey church of this place is a Font of brasse brought out of <HI>Scotland</HI> by <HI>Sir Richard Lée:</HI> as may appeare by a circum∣scription about the same font, as if the font did proclaime the same in it owne person in these wordes.</P>

<P>In the North-west ende of the towne was sometime a stately castle, and called <HI>KINGSBERRIE,</HI> which is as much, as the<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Kingsberie</HI> castle.</NOTE> Kinges house or castle, for BERRYE <HI>castrum et castrametationem significat:</HI> the ruines thereof doe yet somewhat appeare, the place now supplied with a farme house.

was sometime founde there. It was indeede <HI>Stagnum maximum</HI> an ample and large fishpoole of the Kinges, and belonged to his ca∣stle of Kingsberie before spoken of: And the Kinge for his recre∣ation, and delight lying there, did often passe by boate, to and fro within the same, according to the order of the noble men and gen∣tlemen of <HI>Rome,</HI> who did vsually, make fayre fishpondes aboute their houses, to recreate themselues therein: and these with ex∣ceeding cost, as <HI>Marcus Varro</HI> wryteth especially of the wonder∣full large and costly fishpondes of <HI>Hortentius, Hircius</HI> and <HI>Lucullus.</HI> And of these, and such other princely Romans, did these <HI>Verlame</HI> Citizens, take president for this great ponde, which comming af∣terwardes to the king of the land, he often tooke his repasle there∣in, accompanyed commonly with no smalle troupe of his nobles, and therefore the boates, were prouided of large hull, furnished with cable and ancer, that at the kings pleasure, the boate might be moared in any parte of the poole, whereby, how easie it is to loose an ancre in the meere reason may iudge, and this was the occasion of the losse, of the ancre doubtlesse that was found there, and not ordinarie recourse of shippes as some vainely suppose. And yet as <HI>Ouid</HI> sayth: <HI>&amp; vetus inuenta est in montibus anchora summis.</HI> This fish∣poole<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ponde bought of the king &amp; drained dry</NOTE> continued in this pryde, till the time of <HI>Alfric</HI> the seuenth Abbott of this Monastery, who bought the same of the king, and by industry and charge caused it to be drayned drie: And the more to argue it to be but a fishpoole there remayneth yet one witnesse, a streete in the towne lying towardes it called FISHPOOLE∣STREETE.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fishpoole streete.</NOTE></P>
<P>If any boates in former times, came thither, they came from <HI>Staenes</HI> and vp the <HI>Colne</HI> riuer to <HI>Rickmansworth,</HI> to <HI>Watforde</HI> and so to S. <HI>Albans,</HI> but in no sence to the place where the ancre was founde, for that the fall of the water there was such as it coulde yeelde no accesse for shipping against the same. There is indeede a feilde be∣lowe S. <HI>Albans</HI> called <HI>key feyld,</HI> and belowe <HI>Rickmansworth,</HI> a place vpon the riuer called <HI>Westhythe,</HI> which may in sort argue some such passage for boates, but for the first it may bee aswell <HI>pascuum, vacci∣num</HI> a pastour for kye, or kyne, as a strande for fastening of boates or ships &amp; more like. And <HI>Westhithe</HI> may be as wel taken for a house as for a harbour of ships. And yet these simple probabilities might worke that conceite in <HI>Gildas,</HI> who was the authour of this error.</P>
<P>In and about this towne, haue beene sundry battelles conflictes<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. <HI>Albans</HI> spoyled.</NOTE> and spoyles, as in the time of Henrie 3. one <HI>Falcatius de Brent</HI> a no∣torious robber, with a companie of wicked persons came too this towne by night, spoyled the same and murthered many: and would haue set the Abbey on fire, But the Abbot feed him with 100 pound to depart.</P>
<P>This was a dangerous time when theeues and murtheres must be hyred for rewarde and not constrayned by iustice, to desist from
