<HEAD>THE

PREFACE,
OR
INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE Advantages of taking judicious and
accurate Journals in Voyages and Itineraries,
are so great and many, as the Improvements
of</HI> Geography, Hydrography, Astronomy, Na∣tural
<HI>and</HI> Moral History, Antiquity, Merchan∣dise,
Trade, Empire, <HI>&amp;c. that few Books can com∣pare
with them either for Profit or Pleasure. There∣fore</HI>
Ramusio, <HI>the</HI> De Brys, Hackluit, Purchas,
John de Laet, Thevenot, <HI>&amp;c. have begun a very
commendable Design, and their Works are like to be
always useful.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Collection now published, containing some curi∣ous
Voyages, and accurate Journals, never before
printed, both towards the</HI> South <HI>and</HI> North, <HI>beyond
and through the</HI> Magellan Streights; <HI>as also to</HI>
Greenland <HI>or</HI> Spitsberg, Nova Zembla, <HI>and</HI>
Groneland <HI>or</HI> Groyneland. <HI>'Twill be necessary to
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>
premise in general, what other</HI> Navigators <HI>have gone
before to those parts, and what additional Knowledge
may be reap'd from the</HI> ensuing Work; <HI>in doing of
which, we shall observe Order of</HI> Place <HI>and</HI> Time.</P>
<P><HI>First of some Discoveries and Navigations towards
the Southern Parts of the Globe,</HI> South-West <HI>and</HI>
South-East.</P>
<P>A. D. 1519. Ferdinand Magalianes, <HI>a</HI> Portu∣guese
<HI>Gentleman, upon some disgust taken at his Master
King</HI> Emanuel, <HI>applied himself to the Court of</HI> Ca∣stile,
<HI>offering to make great Discoveries of the rich</HI>
Spice-Islands <HI>by the West, and to sail round the Globe.
He was furnish'd with five Ships and 250 Men, by
the Command of</HI> Charles V. <HI>They departed from</HI>
Sevil <HI>August 10. 1519. and after having in vain
attempted to pass through by the great River</HI> La Plate,
<HI>and having winter'd in</HI> Port S. Julian, <HI>they found out
a great</HI> Streight <HI>leading into the South Sea, called af∣terwards,
by the Inventor's Name, the</HI> Magellan
Streight; <HI>through which he was the first that passed
from the</HI> Atlantick <HI>into the</HI> Pacifick Ocean, <HI>and so
round the Globe home again by the</HI> Molucco'<HI>s and</HI>
Cape of Good Hope, <HI>having spent above three
years in this Circumnavigation. Entring the Streight
of his own Name, he found on the Shoar many Sepul∣chres
or Graves, whither the Inhabitants resort in
the Summer time to bury their Dead; he also observ'd
a great Whale thrown up, and many Bones.</HI></P>
<P>Anno Dom. 1525. Garcias de Loyasa <HI>a</HI> Spani∣ard,
<HI>entred into</HI> Magellan's Streight, <HI>and gave
Names to several Places; as did also</HI> Simon de Alca∣zova
<HI>in the year</HI> 1534. <HI>Afterwards the Bishop of</HI>
Placentia <HI>fitted out three Ships, in the Year 1539,
<PB N="vii" REF="4"/>
one of which got through the Streights of</HI> Magellan
<HI>to</HI> Arica <HI>in</HI> Peru.</P>
<P>Anno Dom. 1577. <HI>Sir</HI> Francis Drake, <HI>with
five Ships and Barks, and I64 Men, began his Fa∣mous
Voyage round the Globe; sailing through the a∣forementioned
Streight of</HI> Magellan <HI>to the Coasts of</HI>
Peru, New Spain, Mexico, <HI>and</HI> California; <HI>re∣turning
to</HI> England, <HI>by the</HI> East Indies, <HI>and</HI> Cape
of Good Hope. <HI>Captain</HI> John Winter <HI>was separa∣ted
from Sir</HI> Francis <HI>upon their Entrance into the</HI>
South Sea, <HI>and by Storms was forced back again into
the Streights of</HI> Magellan, <HI>through which he repas∣sed
home, being the first that sailed from the</HI> Paci∣fick
<HI>into the</HI> Atlantick Ocean, <HI>through these
Streights.</HI> Ladriller, <HI>a</HI> Spaniard, <HI>being sent from</HI>
Chili, <HI>to attempt this passage, was driven back by
Storms and the approach of Winter.</HI> Anno 1579.
<HI>the Viceroy of</HI> Peru, <HI>thinking that Sir</HI> Francis
Drake <HI>was sailed to the</HI> Magellan Streights, <HI>equipt</HI>
Don Sarmiento <HI>in the Port of</HI> Lima <HI>with two
Ships to pursue him. This</HI> Spaniard <HI>coasted</HI> Chili
<HI>and</HI> Patagonia, <HI>entring the</HI> Streights, <HI>and so passed
to</HI> Brasil. Sarmiento <HI>upon his return to</HI> Spain, <HI>per∣swaded▪</HI>
Philip II, <HI>to send two Colonies to plant and
fortifie in the</HI> Streights <HI>of</HI> Magellan, <HI>in order to
prevent and obstruct the Navigations, Depredations,
or Settlements of the</HI> English <HI>and</HI> Dutch <HI>in those
parts; but they all miscarried partly by Shipwrack,
partly by Famine, and the Barbarities of the</HI> Pata∣gons.
<HI>This happened in the years</HI> 1584, 1585,
1586. <HI>The Project was contrary to the Advice of
the</HI> Duke <HI>of</HI> Alva.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="5"/>
<HI>Sir</HI> Francis, <HI>in the</HI> Magellan Streight, <HI>saw seve∣ral
of the</HI> Patagons, <HI>or Inhabitants, in their Canoes
and Huts; their Boats were made of the Barks of
Trees and Seal Skins very artificially interwoven, the
Head whereof was semilunar. They painted their Fa∣ces
either with an Earth or a Vegetable. In their
Huts, made of Boughs and Skins of Fishes, he found</HI>
Sea-Wolves <HI>and huge Muscles, whose Shells they shar∣pen
so with rubbing of Stones, that they cut every
thing with them. Their Fresh Water was kept in Ves∣sels
made of the Barks of Trees, and their Vestments
were chiefly made up of the Skins of</HI> Penguins, Seals,
<HI>and other Animals peculiar to the Climate.</HI></P>
<P>Anno Dom. 1586. <HI>The third Circumnavigation
of the Globe was undertaken and performed by</HI> Tho∣mas
Candish <HI><ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who very prosperously finish'd
that in two Years and two Months, which took both</HI>
Magellanus <HI>and Sir</HI> Francis Drake <HI>three years in
compassing.</HI></P>
<P>Anno 1593. <HI>Sir</HI> Richard Hawkins <HI>made his
Voyage into the</HI> South Sea <HI>by the same Sreight that
the aforementioned Navigators did before him. He
gives the most accurate Description of the Tree that
bears the famous</HI> Winter-bark, <HI>see his</HI> Observations
in fol. Printed 1622. pag. 88. This Spicy Aro∣matick
Tree <HI>(says he)</HI> bears Leaves of a whitish
Green, not unlike the <HI>Aspen;</HI> and bears its Fruit
in Clusters like the <HI>Hawthorn,</HI> but that it is
green; each Berry of the bigness of a Pepper∣corn,
and every one of them containing within
four or five Grains or Seeds, twice as big as Mu∣stard
Seed, which broken are white within and
bite like the good Pepper; the Bark hath the
<PB N="ix" REF="5"/>
Taste of all Sorts of Spices, very Stomachick
and Medicinal. We found it in all places of the
Streights where any Trees grew. Here are a∣bundance
of <HI>Muscles,</HI> very refreshing Diet and
full of <HI>Pearl;</HI> also <HI>Limpets,</HI> and incredible Num∣bers
of <HI>Penguins</HI> and <HI>Seals.</HI></P>
<P>Anno Dom. 1598. <HI>The Fourth Circumnaviga∣tion
of the Globe was performed by</HI> Oliver Noort <HI>a</HI>
Dutchman, <HI>his chief Pilot being Captain</HI> Melis <HI>an</HI>
Englishman, <HI>who had accompanied Mr.</HI> Candish <HI>in
his Voyage. This</HI> Noort <HI>steer'd much the same Course
with</HI> Magalianes, Drake, <HI>and</HI> Candish, <HI>having
spent near three years in encompassing the Earth.
He saw, upon the Land of</HI> Patagonia, <HI>some Deer,
a sort of</HI> Bufalo, <HI>and</HI> Ostriches.</P>
<P><HI>We may note here, that in the Year</HI> 1589, <HI>the</HI>
Delight <HI>of</HI> Bristol, <HI>one of the Consorts of</HI> John
Chidley <HI><ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and Mr.</HI> Paul Wheel, <HI>got into the
Streights</HI> of Magellan; <HI>but meeting with Misfor∣tunes,
was forced back, having reach'd only</HI> Cape
Froward. <HI>Also in the year 1598.</HI> Verhagen'<HI>s
Fleet, under Sir</HI> James Mahu, Simon de Cordes,
Sebald de Wert, <HI>&amp;c. wherein</HI> William Adams,
<HI>was chief Pilot, suffered great Miseries in these
Streights. This</HI> Sebald de Wert <HI>gave</HI> Clusius <HI>a
description of the Winter-bark-Tree growing up and
down</HI> Patagonia. <HI>They preserv'd themselves mith</HI>
Geese, Ducks, <HI>vast large</HI> Muscles, Penguins,
Seals, <HI>&amp;c. Returning out of the Streight, and
sailing Southwards they discovered</HI> Sebald's Isles.</P>
<P>Anno Dom. 1614. George Spilbergen <HI>General
of a</HI> Dutch <HI>Fleet of six Ships, passed through the
Streights of</HI> Magellan <HI>and the</HI> South Sea <HI>to the</HI>
<PB N="x" REF="6"/>
East Indies, <HI>from</HI> whence he returned by the <HI>Cape
of Good Hope</HI> to the <HI>Texel,</HI> having been out
about three years. This was the Fifth Circumnavi∣gation
of the Globe.</P>
<P><HI>Ann. Don. 1609, 1610. Pedro Fernandez Gi∣ros</HI> a <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and Captain <HI>Ferdinand de Quir</HI>
a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> do both affirm, That they sailed at seve∣ral
times above 800 Leagues together on the Coast
of a <HI>Southern Continent,</HI> until they came to the
height of 15 degrees of <HI>South Latitude,</HI> where they
found a very fruitful, pleasant, and populous Coun∣try.
<HI>Giros</HI> began to take his Course in the height
of the Streights of <HI>Magellan.</HI> This vast Tract of
Land perhaps may be one side of, or may belong to,
<HI>Jansen Tasmen's Land, Van Diemen's Land,
Zelandia Nova, Hollandia Nova, Carpentaria,</HI>
and <HI>New Guiney;</HI> which the <HI>Dutch</HI> afterwards
coasted, detected, and gave Names to many Bays,
Rivers and Capes, in the Years 1619, 1622,1627,
1628, 1642, <HI>and</HI> 1644. from the <HI>Equinoctial</HI> to
44 deg. <HI>South Lat.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> have indeed made the greatest
Discoveries towards the South <HI>Terra Incognita,</HI>
which they have not yet divulg'd. <HI>Dirk Rem∣brantse</HI>
about 15 or 16 years ago published, in <HI>Low
Dutch,</HI> a short Relation out of the Journal of Cap∣tain
<HI>Abel Jensen Tasmen</HI> upon his Discoveries of
the South <HI>Terra Incognita</HI> in the year 1642, to the
Southward of <HI>Nova Hollandia, Vandemen's Land,</HI>
&amp;c. 'Tis remarkable that all the Circumnavigators
of the Globe enter'd into the <HI>East Indies,</HI> either by the
<HI>Philippines</HI> or the <HI>Molucco's,</HI> being peradventure
hindred from passing round more Southwards by that
<PB N="xi" REF="6"/>
vast long Chain of Land, which seems to stretch
almost from the <HI>Equinosctial</HI> to the 50 degree of
<HI>South Lat.</HI> Therefore they generally steer'd upon
the <HI>South Sea,</HI> either for the <HI>Isles of Salomon,</HI> or
those called the <HI>Ladrones.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anno Dom. 1615. Will. Cornelius Schouten</HI> of
<HI>Horn,</HI> and <HI>Jacob le Maire</HI> of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> under∣took
the Sixth Circumnavigation of the Globe, by a
new Passage Southwards from the Streights of <HI>Ma∣gellan</HI>
in <HI>Terra del Fuogo,</HI> which they happily dis∣covered
and passed, finding out <HI>Sebald's-Isles, Sta∣ten-Land,
Maurice-Land, Barnevelt-Isles,</HI> and so
by <HI>Cape Horn,</HI> in the 57deg. of <HI>S. Lat.</HI> they found
out a new way into the <HI>South Sea;</HI> called ever since
<HI>Le Maire's Streight,</HI> in this Voyage they gave Names
to several Islands and Countries, returning to <HI>Hol∣land</HI>
by the <HI>East Indies,</HI> having been out two years
and Eighteen days. Aftewards a <HI>Spnish Fleet,</HI> under <HI>Bartolemeo Garcias de Nodal, Anno</HI> 1618.
sailed through <HI>Le Maire's Passage:</HI> and in the year
1623. part of <HI>Prince Maurice</HI> his Fleet steered the
same Course, discovering some small Isles. <HI>Nodal</HI>
saw People near <HI>Le Maire's Streight,</HI> all painted and
clad with Birds Skins; they fed upon yellow Flowers
like <HI>Marigolds.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anno 1643. Brewer,</HI> or <HI>Brower,</HI> went another
way into the <HI>South Sea,</HI> by a Passage called after his
own Name, which is east of <HI>Le Maire's Streight;</HI>
but whether <HI>Brewer</HI> went through a New Streight
with Land on each side, or had a wide Sea on the East
we cannot inform you, having never seen the <HI>Diary</HI>
of his Voyage: but most Maps make it a new
Streight, the perhaps he might sail near the same
<PB N="xii" REF="7"/>
Course which Captain <HI>Sharp</HI> afterwards did; they
who have his Voyage may soon determine this Doubt.</P>
<P>The Southern part of <HI>Terra Magellanica,</HI> com∣monly
called <HI>Terra del Fuego,</HI> from the great Fires
seen upon it by the Sailors; seems, by the Observa∣tions
of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> to be divided into many <HI>Isles</HI>
and <HI>Streights</HI> leading into both Seas. The Country
appears mountainous, with fair and green Vallies,
Springs, Rivulets, and much Herbage. The Creeks
are fit for Shipping, Water and Wood being plenti∣ful.
The Air is tempestuous from the vast quantity of
Vapours from both Oceans. The Natives paint their
Bodies, and deck themselves with Shells and Skins.
They make their Baskets and Nets of Rushes, out of
which they twist Lines, and hanging Hooks made of
Stone, and baited with Muscles, they take abundance
of Fish. Their Knives are made of sharpened Bones,
and all their Arrows are armed with them. Their Ca∣noes
are like the <HI>Venetian Gondola's.</HI> For the Descri∣ption
of the Northern part of <HI>Terra Magellanica,</HI>
commonly called <HI>Patagonia,</HI> we refer the Reader to
Sir <HI>John Narbrough</HI>'s Journal, printed at the be∣ginning
of this <HI>Collection.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anno 1669. His Majesty</HI> of <HI>Great Britain,
His Royal Highness</HI> the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>York,</HI> and seve∣others
of the <HI>Nobility,</HI> design'd a better Discovery
of <HI>Chili;</HI> in order whereunto two Ships were sent
out under the Conduct of that great Navigator and
worthy Commander Sir <HI>John Narbrough,</HI> who re∣turned
<HI>June 1671,</HI> having been out above two years,
passing and repassing the Streights of <HI>Magellan,</HI> and
coasting <HI>Patagonia</HI> and <HI>Chili.</HI> His Observations
and Draughts are the most judicious and exact of
of any that went before him.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="7"/>
<HI>Anno</HI> 1680. and 1681. Captain <HI>Sharp</HI> made ma∣ny
bold Adventures on several Islands and Coasts in
the <HI>South Sea.</HI> In his return, he being quite out of
all hopes of recovering the Streights of <HI>Magellan,</HI> or
those of <HI>Le Maire</HI> or <HI>Brewer,</HI> was forced to seek for a
Passage farther South than by <HI>Cape Horn;</HI> he went
to about 60 deg. <HI>South Lat.</HI> meeting with many Islands
of Ice, Snow, Frosts and Whales, departing from a
small Place, named by him the <HI>Duke of York's I∣sland,</HI>
in the <HI>South Sea,</HI> he steered near 800
Leagues to the Eastward, and afterwards as many to
the Westward. The first Land he saw in those three
Months was the <HI>Island of Barbadoes;</HI> so that
Land in the Streight of <HI>Le Maire,</HI> and in <HI>Brewer's
Passage,</HI> must be <HI>Islands,</HI> and not join'd to any great
<HI>Southern Continent,</HI> as suppos'd by some:</P>
<P>Since these Attemps and Undertakings, several
<HI>English</HI> Ships have passed into the <HI>South Sea</HI> both
by the Streights of <HI>Magellan,</HI> and by the South of
<HI>Cape Horn;</HI> but what Trade they manage in those
Parts, or what Discoveries they have made, or what
Articles and Treaty they are engaged in with the
<HI>Spaniard,</HI> we cannot inform the Reader, being no
Merchants our selves, nor having seen any Journals or
Voyages of those Quarters of the World, besides those
before-mentioned.</P>
<P><HI>In these Navigations to the Streights of</HI> Magellan,
<HI>through the</HI> South Sea, <HI>and by the</HI> East Indies <HI>home
again, the Common things noted in the several Voy∣ages,
(beside the</HI> Winds, Longitudes, Latitudes,
Variations of the Compass, Tydes, Soundings,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI>) <HI>are</HI> Flying Fishes, Dolphins, Albacores, Bo∣nito's,
Sharks, Tropick Birds; <HI>The</HI> Sea Weeds
<PB N="xiv" REF="8"/>
<HI>called</HI> Sargasso <HI>and</HI> Tromba; <HI>the</HI> Aromatick Tree
<HI>bearing</HI> Winter's Spicy Bark; Guanico's <HI>or</HI> Indi∣an
Sheep, <HI>a</HI> Species <HI>of small</HI> Camels; <HI>Infinite
Numbers of</HI> Penguins, Seals, Muscles, Whales,
Ostriches, <HI>&amp;c. These observed in sailing to and
through the Streights of</HI> Magellan, <HI>by the several
Navigators aforementioned.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In the</HI> Islands <HI>on the</HI> South Sea, Coco-trees,
Plantanes, Bonana's, Pine Apples, Indian Figs,

particular and fuller Observations have been made up∣on
several of those parts of the World towards the

who have resided long in those <HI>Regions,</HI> or else recei∣ved

Anno Dom. 1497. John Cabot <HI>and</HI> Sebastian
Cabot <HI>his son,</HI> Venetians, <HI>were sent out of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
by</HI> Henry VII. <HI>These, after their Return,
gave an Account and Draught of some</HI> North West
<HI>parts of</HI> America, <HI>and brought four of the Natives
back with them.</HI></P>
<P>Anno Dom, 1553. Sir Hugh Willoughby <HI>went
out to discover a</HI> North East <HI>Passage, and sailed a∣bove</HI>
160 <HI>Leagues</HI> North Easterly <HI>from</HI> Seynam,
<HI>which lies in</HI> 70 deg. North Lat. <HI>'Tis very proba∣ble
he landed on</HI> Nova Zembla <HI>and</HI> Greeland,
<HI>from whence the Cold and Ice forced him to return
more Southerly, till he came to</HI> Arzina, <HI>a River in</HI>
Lapland; <HI>where, the next Spring, that great Man
with all his Company were found frozen to death in
the Ship, in this year the</HI> Russia Company <HI>began to
incorporate</HI></P>
<P>Anno Dom. 1556. Stephen Burrows, <HI>searching
a</HI> Passage <HI>by the</HI> North East <HI>to the</HI> Indies, <HI>sailed
to</HI> 80 deg. 7. min. <HI>and thence to</HI> Nova Zembla, <HI>ha∣ving
been in all likelyhood upon</HI> Greenland, <HI>by the
desolate Land, the blue Ice, and great numbers of
various Fowls, which be mentions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>About this time the</HI> Russia Company <HI>was esta∣blished,

after Ambassadours from Queen</HI> Elizabeth.</P>
<P>Ann. Dom. 1576, 1577, 1578, <HI>Sir</HI> Martin
Forbisher, <HI>made three several Voyages to find out a</HI>
North West <HI>Passage, in which he made several new
Discoveries of great</HI> Sreights, Bays Islands <HI>and</HI>
Capes, <HI>as well as</HI> Land <HI>on both sides, to all which
he gave Names. His Men brought home great store
of glittering</HI> Marchasites, <HI>which the</HI> London Gold∣smiths
<PB N="xvii" REF="9"/>
<HI>took to be Gold Oars. He met with Inhabi∣tants
on the Shores of the</HI> Streight <HI>called by his
Name; their</HI> Canoes <HI>were made of</HI> Seal-skins <HI>at
top, but wood</HI> Keels: <HI>They exchanged Salmon and
other Fish, for Toyes: In their Tents abundance of</HI>
Red Beans <HI>were found, like unto those of</HI> Guinea:
<HI>But more of</HI> Frobisher'<HI>s Observations in our Supple∣ment

<P>Anno Dom. 1580. Arthur Pet, <HI>and</HI> Charles
Jackman, <HI>sailed all over these Northern Seas, and
passed into</HI> Waigats Streights, <HI>plying along the
East part of</HI> Nova Zembla, <HI>so far as the Ice would
give them leave, and finding no possibility of Passage,
returned back the latter end of the year</HI></P>
<P>Anno 1583. <HI>Sir</HI> Humfrey Gilbert, <HI>by the insti∣gation
of</HI> Secretary Walsingham, <HI>sailed to</HI> New∣foundland,
<HI>and the great River of</HI> S. Laurence <HI>in</HI>
Canada, <HI>which he took Possession of in the Name of
Queen</HI> Elizabeth, <HI>and setled a Fishing-Trade there.</HI></P>
<P>An. Dom. 1585. <HI>Mr.</HI> John Davis <HI>was employ'd
to search out to the</HI> North-West, <HI>beyond where</HI> Fro∣bisher
<HI>went: he made further Discoveries in those
Parts; which see in</HI> Hakluyt, <HI>and</HI> Purchas, <HI>This</HI>
Davis <HI>made three Voyages to the</HI> North-West: <HI>Du∣ring
his stay at</HI> Cape Desolation, <HI>he found many
pieces of Fur and Wooll, like to Beaver,</HI> and exchang∣ed
Commodities with the Country People. Upon the
Rocks and in the Moss, grew a Shrub whose fruit was
very sweet, full of red juice like currans, perhaps
'tis the same with the New-England Cranberry,
<HI>or</HI> Bear-Berry, <HI>(lall'd so from the Bears devouring
it very greedily;) with which we make Tarts.</HI> Vitis

<P><HI>An. Dom. 1594, 1595, 1596. William Barents,</HI>
a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> made three several Voyages to the
North-East, at the Charge of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI>
in the last of which, he was compell'd to winter in
<HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> about the 75 <HI>deg. of North Lat.</HI>
In these Voyages they Discovered <HI>Bear,</HI> or <HI>Cherry-Island,</HI>
and went upon <HI>Greenland.</HI> These <HI>Dutch</HI>
Navigations were written by <HI>Gerart de Veer,</HI> and
contain great variety of curious Observations, to
which Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> owns himself much beholden, in
the composing his History of Cold. They conversed
with, and described the <HI>Samoyeds;</HI> coasted <HI>Nova
Zembla,</HI> giving Names to several Points, Capes,
Bays, Islands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They discovered the <HI>Bernacle
Goose,</HI> or <HI>Clakis,</HI> sitting upon their Eggs, under
the 80th. <HI>deg. North Lat.</HI> They give good Descrip∣tions
of the Whales, Morses, Birds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and relate
<HI>Phoenomena</HI> of Cold (during their melancholy winter
Abode there) with ingenuity and judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="xix" REF="10"/>
<HI>An. Dom. 1611.</HI> That worthy Seaman Sir <HI>Tho∣mas
Button,</HI> Servant to <HI>Prince Henry,</HI> pursued the
North-West Discoveries, at the instigation of that
glorious young <HI>Prince.</HI> He passed <HI>Hudsons Streight,</HI>
and leaving <HI>Hudsons Bay</HI> to the South, sailed above
200 Leagues to the South-West-ward, over a Sea a∣bove
80 Fathom deep, and discovered a great <HI>Con∣tinent,</HI>
called by him <HI>New Wales;</HI> where, after
much misery and sickness in his wintering at <HI>Port
Nelson,</HI> he beat and searched the whole Bay with great
Industry, (called afterwards <HI>Button's Bay,</HI>) even
back again almost to <HI>Digge</HI>'s <HI>Island.</HI> He discover∣ed
the great Land he called <HI>Cary</HI>'s <HI>Swans-nest.</HI>
Many men were lost during his abode in that River,
named by him <HI>Port Nelson,</HI> in <HI>North Lat. 57 deg.
10 min.</HI> tho he kept three Fires in his Ship all the
Winter, and was supply'd with great store of white
Partridges, and other Fowl, of which his Company is
reported to have kill'd 1800 Dozen, besides some Deer,
Bears, and Foxes. on the Shores of those <HI>North-West
Bays</HI> grows abundance of <HI>Orpine, Sorrel,</HI> and
<HI>Scurvygrass,</HI> very much <HI>Angelica,</HI> whose Root the
<HI>Gronelanders</HI> eat. They kill <HI>Morses,</HI> and make
their Cords, or Ropes of <HI>Whalebone.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In the years 1610, 1612, 1615, 1626.</HI> Mr. <HI>Hud∣son,
James Hall,</HI> and <HI>William Baffin,</HI> proceeded
much further in the North-West Parts, giving Names
to their several Discoveries; which may be seen in
the Northern Maps, and in the Collection of Voyages,
as also in our <HI>Supplement</HI> at the end.</P>
<P>The <HI>King of Denmark</HI> observing the progress of
his Neighbours in the Northern Seas, began to send
out Ships for making Discoveries, in the year 1605;
<PB N="xx" REF="11"/>
1606, 1607, but these performed little. At last
in the year 1619, he equipp'd <HI>John Munck</HI> with two
Ships, who tracing <HI>Forbisher</HI> and <HI>Hudson,</HI> came to
the 63 <HI>deg. 20 min.</HI> where he was forced to winter,
and called it <HI>Muncks Harbour,</HI> and the Country
<HI>New Denmark.</HI> (It seems to be near <HI>Diggs Island.</HI>)
See <HI>Muncks Voyage,</HI> Printed in <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Paris;</HI>
also our <HI>Supplement</HI> at the end.</P>
<P><HI>In 1608. Henry Hudson</HI> was sent out by the
<HI>English Company</HI> to discover the <HI>North Pole;</HI> he
proceeded to the <HI>82 deg. of Lat.</HI> as also did <HI>Thomas
Marmaduke</HI> of <HI>Hull,</HI> 1612. who saw divers <HI>Islands</HI>
beyond that, and gave names to divers Places upon
<HI>Greenland.</HI> He went upon <HI>Nova Zembla</HI> in <HI>June</HI>
and <HI>July,</HI> and observed Deer feeding here and there
on green places, tho at that very time of the year it
freezes in that Climate.</P>
<P><HI>In the year 1610.</HI> the <HI>Company</HI> began to apply
themselves to the killing of <HI>Morses,</HI> and to the <HI>Whale
Fishing,</HI> which they found most plentiful about
<HI>Cherry Island,</HI> and <HI>Greenland;</HI> they began also to
find those long <HI>Bones</HI> commonly called <HI>Unicorns
Horns. In the years</HI> 1611, 1612, 1613, 1614,
1617, 1619, 1620, 1622. the <HI>English Company,</HI>
finding these Northern Expeditions so very profitable,
encreas'd the number of their Shipping to 13, or 14
yearly, under the Conduct of <HI>Poole, Fotherby, Edge,
Heley,</HI> and others, who gave names to several <HI>Sounds</HI> and <HI>Points, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Yet we find little worth relating of <HI>Greenland</HI> till
1630. in which year some <HI>English,</HI> commanded by
<HI>Captain Goodler,</HI> were forced to wander up and down
the Country, and to Winter there. A full Relation
<PB N="xxi" REF="11"/>
whereof being Published by Dr. <HI>W. Watts,</HI> we shall re∣fer
the Reader thereunto.</P>
<P>Some <HI>English</HI> also wintered in <HI>Greenland in the
year 1633.</HI> and another <HI>Company</HI> in <HI>1634;</HI> the
last all perished there.</P>
<P><HI>In these several Navigations to</HI> Greenland, <HI>our Men
gave Names to many places, as</HI> Hackluit's Headland,
Whale-Bay, Horn-Sound, <HI>from the</HI> long Bones
<HI>call'd the</HI> Unicorns, Ice-Point, Bell-Point, Low∣ness-Isle,
Black-Point, Cape-Cold, Ice-Sound,
Knotty-Point, Deer-Sound, Smiths-Bay, Hope-Island,
Edges Island, Wyches Island, Bear-Island
Charles Island. <HI>Afterwards the</HI> Dutch <HI>gave other
Names of their own to these places, which has bred
some confusion in Maps and Books.</HI></P>
<P>Our men that wintered in <HI>Greenland, 1630.</HI> lost
the light of the Sun <HI>October 14.</HI> and saw him not
again till <HI>February 3.</HI> Those that staid there in
1633, say, that <HI>Octob. 5.</HI> was the last day they per∣ceived
the light of the Sun, tho they had a twilight,
by which they could read, till <HI>Octob. 17.</HI> On the
22. the Stars were plain to be seen all the 24 hours,
and so contiuued all Winter. Jan. 15. they perceiv∣ed,
for 6 or 7 hours about noon, so much light as to
read by it. <HI>Feb. 12.</HI> they saw the Rays of the Sun
upon the tops of the Mountains, and the next day his
whole Body. Our men that remained in <HI>Greenland,
1634.</HI> left in writing before they perished, that the
Sun disappeared <HI>October 10.</HI> and was seen again
<HI>Feb. 14.</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> that wintered in <HI>Nova Zem∣bla</HI>
in <HI>1596.</HI> lost the Sun on <HI>Novemb. 4.</HI> but the
Moon in her highest degrees was seen night and day.
<HI>Jan. 24.</HI> they saw the edge of the Sun above the Ho∣rizon.</P>
<P><PB N="xxii" REF="12"/>
The difference of these appearances, doth not
proceed from different <HI>Refractions,</HI> but from the dif∣ference
of <HI>Latitude,</HI> in which the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI>
wintered, tho the cold in <HI>Nova Zembla</HI> exceeded
that felt in <HI>Greenland.</HI> In these <HI>Countries</HI> there
is a continued Day for four or five months in the
year, as well as a perpetual Night for three months,
so for the most part there is either all Light, or all
Darkness.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> that were necessitated to winter in
<HI>Greenland,</HI> liv'd upon Venison (of which there is
great store, perhaps 'tis of the <HI>Rhin-deer</HI>) upon <HI>Mor∣ses,
Bears, Foxes,</HI> &amp;c. The <HI>Bears</HI> Flesh was tole∣rably
pleasant and wholsom, but the Liver made their
skins peel off; which was also observed by the <HI>Dutch</HI>
that wintered in <HI>Nova Zembla.</HI> As the Sun and
Day-light began to appear, the <HI>Fowls,</HI> and <HI>Foxes</HI>
crept abroad, for which they set Traps and Springs,
and so took vast numbers: The <HI>Foxes</HI> proved whol∣som
Food, for by it the <HI>Dutch</HI> were also relieved in
their <HI>Scurveys.</HI> In <HI>May</HI> they found great store of
<HI>Eggs</HI> laid by <HI>Willocks.</HI> The cold had prodigious
Effects on our Men in <HI>Greenland,</HI> and on the <HI>Dutch</HI>
in <HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> as blistering and ulcering their
Flesh, freezing their Sack and Spirits, stopping their
Clocks, freezing everything by the fire side; all which
<HI>Captain James</HI> suffer'd in the <HI>Island</HI> of <HI>Charleton,</HI>
tho only in the 51 <HI>Deg.</HI> of <HI>North Lat.</HI> whereas the
<HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> winter'd in 75 and <HI>78 Deg. of
North Lat.</HI> In the building of Houses, Tents, and
Cabins, upon these melancholy occasions, 'twas found
expedient to make them under ground, and to line
them with the skins of Beasts, thereby to keep out the
sharp impressions of the air.</P>
<P><PB N="xxiii" REF="12"/>
Authors are a little confus'd in the History of
<HI>Whales,</HI> some reckon up <HI>10 Species,</HI> but <HI>Wormius</HI>
and <HI>Bartholine,</HI> make them up <HI>22.</HI> giving them va∣rious
Names from their difference in Colours, in
Fins, in Teeth, in Whalebone, in Spouts, in Oyl,
in <HI>Sperma Ceti, &amp;c. Rondeletius, Gesner, Bel∣lonius,
Schonveld, Faber, Clusius,</HI> and <HI>Tulpius,</HI>
seem indeed to describe 6 or 7 distinct sorts of Whales,
as the <HI>Balaena Vulgaris,</HI> the <HI>Balaena Vera,</HI> the
<HI>Orca</HI> or <HI>Balaena dentata,</HI>(perhaps our <HI>Grampus,</HI>) the
<HI>Physeter</HI> or <HI>Whirle-Pool,</HI> the <HI>Cete</HI> or <HI>Pot-Walfish,</HI>
the <HI>Monoceros</HI> or <HI>Unicorn</HI> Whale. The <HI>Trumpa</HI>
Whale or <HI>Spouter,</HI> may perhaps be the <HI>Physeter,</HI> and the
<HI>Sperma Ceti</HI> Whale the <HI>Pot-Walfish,</HI> thothe <HI>Spout</HI> and
<HI>Sperma Ceti</HI> may be common to many of them. We

<HI>An Account of</HI> Whales <HI>by Sir Thomas Sybbalds,</HI>
who has had opportunities of viewing them on the
Coasts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and therefore seems to be more
exact than other Writers; but we having never read
this Book, must be content to refer the Reader to it;
expecting in the mean time more clear distinctions of
them from the Excellent Mr. <HI>Ray,</HI> in his intended
<HI>Synopsis</HI> of <HI>Fishes</HI> and <HI>Birds.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anno Dom. 1653.</HI> The <HI>King of Denmark</HI> re∣solv'd
to advance the Northern Trade and Discove∣ries,
and therefore equipp'd, and set out three Ships,
with Orders to take the most exact Account of all the
Coasts and Places they came at, and to Report them
at their return with all possible Curiosity, that there∣by
the Voyage might be every way beneficial. They
passed the <HI>Weygat Streights,</HI> and found some Inha∣bitants
of <HI>Nova Zembla</HI> in their <HI>Canoes,</HI> or little
<PB N="xxiv" REF="13"/>
Fishing-Boats: These people were very nimble on
Foot, and were cloath'd with Vestments of the Skins
of great Birds, like <HI>Penguins,</HI> and <HI>Pelicans,</HI> with
the Feathers upon them. Their Boots were made of
the Hides of <HI>Morses,</HI> or great <HI>Seals;</HI> they had Qui∣vers
at their backs full of Arrowes, with a Hatchet
of Fish-Bones; their Temper untractable and indocil,
abhorring our Beer, Spirits, and Meats. Leaving
<HI>Nova Zembla</HI> they streer'd to <HI>Greenland.</HI> These
Countries afford no Trees, or Shrubs, except a little
<HI>Juniper,</HI> and a few dwarf <HI>Firs;</HI> abundance of <HI>Moss,
Heath,</HI> a sort of <HI>Cabbage; Lettice, Scurvygrass,
Sorrel, Snake-weed, Harts-tongue,</HI> a kind of <HI>Straw∣berry,</HI>
divers species of <HI>Ranunculus,</HI> and <HI>Houseleek.</HI>
In the Holes and Rocks infinite quantity of Fowls
Nests, whose dung with the Moss washed down, makes
a mould in the Valleys or Clefts, which produce the
aforementioned Plants; otherwise the <HI>Country</HI> is ge∣nerally
made up of vast heaps of Rocks, broken Stones,
and Ice heaped up from many Generations.</P>
<P>Of Water-Fowb there is incredible variety, and in
so great abundance, that with their flight they darken
the Sun, and cover the Sea. There are also great quan∣tities
of <HI>Dog-Fishes, Lobsters, Gernels, Star-Fish,
Mackrel, Dolphins,</HI> &amp;c. a sort of <HI>Sea-Spider</HI> found
in <HI>Whales</HI> Stomachs. For all which see the <HI>French

for <HI>18</HI> Months, young Sir <HI>John Wolstenhome</HI>

He traced <HI>Frobisher, Hudson, Davis, Baffin,</HI> and
<PB N="xxv" REF="13"/>
<HI>Button;</HI> meeting with Whales, much Ice, and Fowls.
He built a Pinnace in River <HI>Nelson,</HI> where he found
several remains left there by Sir <HI>Thomas Button:</HI>
he observed abundance of small spruce Fir-Trees on
both sides that River almost covered with moss, and
other sorts of Trees, but small; the Valleys had good
grass, Black-Berries, Strawberries, Vetches, Venison,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> but no Natives or Inhabitants to be met with in
this place, tho in other parts of these Seas he saw se∣veral
<HI>Savages.</HI> Captain <HI>James</HI> departing from <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
soon after Captain <HI>Fox,</HI> upon the same design,
they both met and caress'd each other near <HI>Port Nel∣son,</HI>
in the month of <HI>August. Fox</HI> got home before
winter, but the <HI>other</HI> was forced to stay till the
next Summer. Of which, more in the following Pa∣ragraph,

<P><HI>Anno 1631.</HI> The most ingenious Captain <HI>Tho∣mas
James</HI> was employ'd by the inquisitive <HI>Merchants</HI>
of <HI>Bristol,</HI> to attempt and discover a <HI>North-West
Passage</HI> into the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> and was designed for so
difficult a work by <HI>King Charles the First;</HI> who was
pleased to command him to publish his Voyage in the
<HI>year 1633.</HI> wherein he gives a very accurate and ju∣dicious
Account of the hardships both in going, win∣tering,

and of the <HI>Natural Rarities</HI> both Philosophi∣cal
and Mathematical, together with a <HI>Plat</HI> or <HI>Card,</HI>

confesses that he took many Passages and Phaenomena
related in his <HI>History of Cold.</HI> This excellent Na∣vigator
seems to be of opinion, that there is no pas∣sing

Reasons may be read at large in his <HI>Journal</HI> printed

and laid the Foundation of an advantageous Trade in
those parts. But in the year 1687. this place was
seized upon by the <HI>French.</HI> See more of Captain
<HI>James</HI>'s <HI>Voyage</HI> and <HI>Discoveries</HI> in our <HI>Supple∣ment</HI>
at the end.</P>
<P><HI>Anno 1671. Frederick Martens,</HI> an <HI>Hambur∣ger,</HI>
undertook the <HI>Greenland Voyage,</HI> upon a de∣sire,
as may be suppos'd, in great part to satisfie the
Curiosity and Enquiries of the <HI>Royal Society;</HI> which
be performed in his admirable <HI>Diary</HI> printed in <HI>High
Dutch</HI> in <HI>Quarto,</HI> being assisted therein by the fa∣mous
<HI>Fogelius.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anno 1676.</HI> The industrious and most ingenious
Captain <HI>Wood,</HI> was again sent out by his <HI>Majesty
King Charles the Second,</HI> to make a more perfect
Discovery of the <HI>North-East Parts</HI> for a passage to
the <HI>East-Indies:</HI> He went no further than the 76
<HI>Degree</HI> of <HI>North Lat.</HI> where he lost his Ship on the
Coast of <HI>Nova Zembla.</HI> His opinion is, there is
no sailing this <HI>North-East Way</HI> to <HI>China, Japan,</HI>
&amp;c. The like opinion Captain <HI>James</HI> hath given of
<PB N="xxvii" REF="14"/>
the <HI>North-West Passage,</HI> being both perswaded there∣unto
by the <HI>stretching of the Land,</HI> by the <HI>distra∣ction
and reversion of half Tides,</HI> by the <HI>motion
of the Ice,</HI> &amp;c. besides the Fogs, Snow, Frosts, vast
Islands of Ice, and the Weather, are insuperable.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Witsen</HI> in his Letter to the <HI>Royal Society
Anno 1691.</HI> writes against the <HI>North-East Passage</HI>
to <HI>Japan:</HI> he retracts his former Opinion of making
<HI>Nova Zembla</HI> join upon the <HI>Continent</HI> with <HI>Tar∣tary,</HI>
having since been better inform'd. He thinks
the <HI>Tartarian Points</HI> may run very far North, and
perhaps reach to <HI>America.</HI> Captain <HI>Wood</HI> fancies,
that <HI>Nova Zembla</HI> and <HI>Greenland</HI> are the same <HI>Con∣tinent,</HI>
If these Conjectures of Captain <HI>James,</HI> Cap∣tain
<HI>Wood,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Witsen,</HI> concerning the <HI>North-East,</HI>
and <HI>North-West Passages</HI> to the <HI>East-Indies</HI>
should not be true, yet the difficulties of sailing those
ways would be invincible.</P>
<P>But now it seems convenient to come to the <HI>present
Work,</HI> and to give an account what is contained
therein. The <HI>Authors</HI> are Four, <HI>viz.</HI> Sir <HI>John Nar∣borough,</HI>
Captain <HI>Jansen Tasman,</HI> Captain <HI>Wood,</HI>
and <HI>Frederick Marten.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> Sir <HI>John Narborough</HI> is so well known in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
and so famous beyond the Seas, that I need say
nothing of his great Abilties. His <HI>Voyage</HI> into
the <HI>South-Sea</HI> is mentioned before, but this is the
first time of Publishing it.</P>
<P><HI>II.</HI> Captain <HI>Abel Jansen Tasman's Voyage</HI> from
<HI>Batavia</HI> in the <HI>Island of Java,</HI> to the <HI>South Terra
Incognita</HI> is the more considerable, in that 'tis the
<HI>Discovery</HI> of a <HI>New World,</HI> not yet known to the
<HI>English.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xxviii" REF="15"/>
'Tis probable by <HI>Abel Jansen Tasman's</HI> Navigati∣on,
that <HI>New Guinea, New Carpentaria,</HI> and
<HI>New Holland,</HI> are a vast prodigious Island, which
he seems to have encompassed in his Voyage, setting
out from <HI>Batavia</HI> to <HI>Maurice</HI> Isle, East of <HI>Mada∣gascar;</HI>
from whence bearing away South to 49 deg.
of <HI>South Lat.</HI> and then East and by North to <HI>Lat. 42</HI>
and <HI>44,</HI> he fell upon those new Tracts of Land call'd
<HI>Van Diemen's,</HI> and afterwards upon <HI>New Zealand,</HI>
to the South-East of <HI>New Holland;</HI> returning to
<HI>Batavia</HI> through part of the South Sea (wherein he
Discover'd new Islands) and so Northwards of <HI>New
Guinea</HI> to the <HI>Molucco's,</HI> and <HI>Java.</HI></P>
<P><HI>III.</HI> Captain <HI>Wood</HI> was a most excellent Naviga∣tor:
He, together with Sir <HI>Cloudsly Shovel,</HI> ac∣companied
Sir <HI>John Narborough</HI> to <HI>Chili:</HI> After∣wards
he was sent by <HI>Charles II.</HI> to Discover a <HI>North-East
Passage</HI> to <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan</HI> by <HI>Nova Zembla</HI>
and <HI>Tartary;</HI> of which you have here an <HI>Abstract</HI>
never Printed before.</P>
<P><HI>IV. Frederick Marten</HI> of <HI>Hamburgh</HI> Published
his Observations made in <HI>Greenland</HI> in the <HI>High
Dutch,</HI> a Language little understood in <HI>England.</HI>
His Voyage being the last and best was much desired
here, it being full of <HI>Draughts</HI> and curious <HI>Remarks;</HI>
the Copying and Translating of which, are perform'd
with all possible diligence.</P>
<P>These four make up the <HI>Volume,</HI> together with
many new <HI>Carts</HI> and <HI>Designs,</HI> drawn upon the seve∣ral
places, which do much illustrate the <HI>Work,</HI> and
improve both <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Mathematical Science.</HI>
To these we thought fit to tack a <HI>Supplement</HI> con∣taining
some Observations on <HI>Groneland,</HI> or <HI>Engrone∣land,</HI>
<PB N="xxix" REF="15"/>
as also upon some Northern <HI>Islands, North-East,</HI>
and <HI>North-West.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis to be lamented, that the <HI>English Nation</HI> have
not sent along with their <HI>Navigators</HI> some skilful
<HI>Painters, Naturalists,</HI> and <HI>Mechanists,</HI> under pub∣lick
<HI>Stipends</HI> and <HI>Encouragement,</HI> as the <HI>Dutch</HI>
and <HI>French</HI> have done, and still practise daily, much
to their Honour, as well as Advantage. The <HI>English</HI>
have Capacity, Industry, and Judgment in these Mat∣ters,
equal to, if not beyond their Neighbours, <HI>Sint
Maecenates,</HI> We are apt to imitate a <HI>certain Prince</HI>
in every thing, except in the most glorious and best
Part of him, <HI>viz. The Encouraging and Reward∣ing
great Men in all Professions, and the promot∣ing
Arts and Sciences with his Treasure:</HI> A <HI>Secret</HI>
which some <HI>Ministers</HI> think not fit to practise, or per∣haps
may be insensible of, for want of penetration.
This makes a great Figure in the present and future
Ages, covers many Spots and Deformities, and se∣cures
the best <HI>Heads,</HI> and <HI>Hands</HI> to carry on, and
effect <HI>great Designs.</HI></P>

trade with the Natives, at his Majesty's Charge.</P>
<P>Wednesday <HI>September</HI> 29. Hazy weather, the
Wind to the North-west and by West, a fresh gale:
I stood to the South-west-ward as near as I could;
this day at twelve a Clock, the <HI>Lizard</HI> bore North
of me a little Easterly, distance about 12 Leagues,
according to my account; Latitude by account, is
49 <HI>d.</HI> 35 <HI>m.</HI> This day I spoke with a <HI>French</HI> Banker:
<HI>Lizard</HI> in <HI>England</HI> lies in the Lat. of 50 <HI>d.</HI> 10 <HI>m.</HI>
and in Longitude East, from the Meridian of the
West part of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> one of the Islands of the
<HI>Azores</HI> 18 <HI>d.</HI> 30 <HI>m.</HI> From the <HI>Lizard</HI> I take my de∣parture,
and keep my daily account of the diffe∣rence
of my Longitude from that Meridian.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> the 17. I made the <HI>Madera;</HI> which Island
is high Land, and irregular in Hills, with Wood
on the top and down the sides; Planted with
Vines: there is some Sugar made in the Island;
the Inhabitants <HI>Portugueses.</HI> The City of <HI>Fonchiale</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="23"/>
is the Metropolis, and is situated in a Bay on the
South part of the Island, close to the Sea side, wal∣led
next the Sea, and well fortified with Ord∣nance;
fresh water comes running into the Sea in
the middle of the Bay, in a fair Rivulet from un∣der
an Arch in the Wall; the shoar-sides are
great pebble stones in the Bay, and Rocks in the
other places; the Road is foul ground, to the East
part of it: the Ships ride in shot of Ordnance of
the City: this City is about an English mile in
length, and three quarters of a mile in breadth.</P>
<P>The Desarts are barren rocky Isles of a good
heighth, and lie at the South-east point of <HI>Madera,</HI>
above a mile distant from the shore; there is wa∣ter
enough between <HI>Madera</HI> and the Desarts in the
midway, and no danger; the Desarts trent to the
South-east. <HI>Fonchiale</HI> Bay in the Isle of <HI>Madera</HI> lies
in the Latitude of 32 <HI>d.</HI> 10 <HI>m.</HI> North, and in Lon∣gitude
West from the <HI>Lizard</HI> of <HI>England</HI> 10 <HI>d.</HI> 1 <HI>m.</HI>
and Meridian distance 143 Leagues.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> being the 17th. fair Weather and little
wind at North-west, Course by my Compass
South-west. I make my true Course from <HI>Fonchiale</HI>
Bay, till to day at noon South-south-west, di∣stance,
sailed 34 miles six tenths departure West 13
miles; Diff. Lat. 00 <HI>d.</HI> 32 <HI>m.</HI> Lat. by account 31 <HI>d.</HI>

<HI>Fonchiale</HI> West 00 <HI>d.</HI> 16 <HI>m.</HI> To day at noon I saw
the Island of <HI>Madera,</HI> bearing <HI>N</HI> b. <HI>E:</HI> the body of
the Isle distant by estimation 11 leagues; it makes
in a bluff body at the West end, and trents to the
<PB N="4" REF="24"/>
East: Course by the Compass this afternoon <HI>SW.</HI>
little wind to night; I shaped my nearest Course
for the Island of St. <HI>Jago</HI> with all the sail I could
make, the <HI>Batchelour Pink</HI> in Company; I gave
order to my Master to make the best of his way
to St. <HI>Jago</HI> Island, but not to leave the Company
of the <HI>Batchelour.</HI></P>
<P>Saturday <HI>October</HI> 23. The wind at <HI>N.</HI> b. <HI>E.</HI> a gale:
this day in the forenoon I crossed the <HI>Tropick</HI> of
<HI>Cancer,</HI> all my men in good health, I praise the Al∣mighty
God for it: many of my men that had
been with me in the <HI>Indies</HI> formerly, were let
blood; for I take bleeding in these hot Climates
to be a great preserver of health, diverting Ca∣lentures;
I experienc'd it in two Voyages before
to the Island of St. <HI>Helena,</HI> and in one to the
Coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI> where several of my men under
that distemper, were preserved by bleeding; in all
these Voyages I was never sick one day, nor in
two years time in the Mediterranean Sea, nor at
the <HI>Canaries;</HI> for when I came near the <HI>Equino∣ctial</HI>
I always breathed a Vein.</P>
<P>Thursday <HI>October</HI> 28. the Wind at East-North-East
a stiff gale; this Morning I saw the Isle of
<HI>Mayo</HI> bearing <HI>S.</HI> b. <HI>W.</HI> distant by estimation eight
Leagues; it makes a high Hill, and Craggy to the
East part, and low land towards the shore-side, to
the North-west part of the Island; it lies from <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣navist
S.</HI> b. <HI>W.</HI> distant near 18 leagues. This day
at 11 a Clock I anchored in the Road in seven fa∣thom
water, sandy Ground, about a mile from the
shore; the Northernmost point of the Road bear∣ing
<HI>N. N. W.</HI> half a point to the West, and the Sou∣thern
<PB N="5" REF="24"/>
point of the Road, bearing South-east from
me; distant about a mile and an half: there are
craggy Rocks to the South of the Road on the
shore side, but to the North a low sandy shore;
the Road is on the North-west and by West part
of the Island in a small sandy Bay; there's the Salt∣pond
a bow's shot from the Sea in the low flat
Land; fresh water is very scarce here: I went a∣shore
presently after I had anchored, and found a
heap of Salt of about 20 Tuns; I got aboard a∣gain
immediately, and sent the Long-boat ashore,
which brought off 2 Tuns and ½, the Suff came in
so much that no more could be got off; we halled
the Seyne here, and caught abundance of good
Mullets, with some <HI>Cavalle</HI> and silver Fish; one of
the Islanders a <HI>Negro</HI> came aboard, whom I sent
ashore, to tell the People that if they brought
down some Cattle I would buy some of them; I
rode here all Night; fair Weather, the Wind Ea∣sterly.
This side of the Island is dry land with∣out
wood; here are many Goats, and Guinea
Hens.</P>
<P>Friday <HI>October</HI> 29. fair Weather, the wind at
<HI>NE.</HI> a fine gale: this Morning I sent my Boat a∣shore,
and bought of the Islanders some Goats at
½ a piece of Eight per Head, and 8 Cows excellent
good meat at 6 pieces of Eight a Cow, giving the
skins again; my men caught a great many Fish
with the Seyne, which this day we split, and laid
in pickle four Hours, then dried them to keep,
which they will a long time in any Climate, as I
have experienced in other Voyages, and are very
good Victuals at Sea: I made what dispatch I
<PB N="6" REF="25"/>
could to be gone for St. <HI>Jago</HI> Island. This day in
the forenoon, a Ship passed by to the Westward
on the South side of the Isle, and in the afternoon
we saw several Ships coming from the North∣ward,
which were the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Fleet bound
for <HI>Brazil;</HI> they halled into <HI>Port Praya</HI> in the Isle
of St. <HI>Jago</HI> to water: this night I weighed, and
stood away at twelve a Clock South-south-west
for <HI>Port Praya,</HI> with the Pink in Company; I
touched at the Isle of <HI>May</HI> for Salt, which I knew
would be a great help to get Provisions in the
Voyage.</P>
<P>Saturday <HI>October</HI> 30. fair wind at North-east and
by North a fresh gale. This Morning I steered
South-west for the South side of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> where
is the Road of <HI>Port Praya,</HI> lying near South-west
from the Road of the Isle of <HI>May,</HI> and distant nine
Leagues. This day at 12 a Clock I cast my best
Bower-anchor in <HI>Port Praya</HI> Road, in 10 fathom
rough Ground, the East Point bore East of me,
and the West Point about West-south-west, about
half a mile off; I could not go into the best of the
Road, the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Fleet of about thirty six Sail
riding in it; the Great <HI>Padre Eternel</HI> Admiral,
bound for <HI>Brazil,</HI> is a very great Ship and well
built, they say she is in Burthen 1700 Tuns, she
hath Ports for three Tier of Guns flush, but now
she had but eighty, and poorly mann'd with Sea∣men,
and so were all the rest, six Frigats might
have taken most of the Fleet. At my coming in
to Anchor, the Admiral saluted me with seven
Guns, I thanked him with as many; Captain <HI>Fran∣cis
Wilksheir</HI> in the <HI>Jerusalem</HI> fired five, I returned
<PB N="7" REF="25"/>
him three; so did the Reer-Admiral, and I re∣turn'd
the Complement in the like number, several
of the Fleet fired three, whom I answer'd in con∣clusion
with three for all. I rode on the broad
side of the Admiral, and saluted the Fort with five
Guns, which return'd three, then I sent my Lieu∣tenant
ashore to ask leave of the Governour to wa∣ter,
which he granted forthwith; my Coopers, got
the Cask ready, and this Evening put one boat's
lading aboard.</P>
<P>Sunday <HI>Octobor</HI> 31. fair Weather, the wind at
North-east a fine gale. This Morning <HI>Don Carolus</HI>
went ashore to <HI>Pryam;</HI> with much ado I got off a
boats lading of Water, for the <HI>Portuguese</HI> boats
were filling too, and a great many Soldiers at the
watering place snatch'd some of our mens Hats
off, and run away, wherefore I would not let my
men go any more this day for fear of quarreling.
This Bay of <HI>Port Praya,</HI> as they call it, is no Port,
but a fine round Bay, having high steep Cliffs on
the East side, and in the bottom a steep Hill, where
the Castle is, that hath but four Guns, and is of
no force; there is a small Fort on the top of a Hill
on the East side, which hath three Guns. On the
North-west part of the Bay the shore is gravelly
and sandy, and there's a Grove of Coco-nut trees:
A fresh water Rivulet runs down into the Valley,
and thence through the Sand soaks into the Sea:
this Water is in great quantity, very good, and
keeps well at Sea: to the west part of this Bay lies
a small Island close on the shore, which has Grass
on it that may be cut off for Cattle, which I did;
this Road is no safeguard for Shipping, for a Man
<PB N="8" REF="26"/>
of War may take any Ship out of the Bay, without
receiving any damage from the Forts ashore, and
with Fire-Ships a whole Fleet may be spoiled at
pleasure; for it's a fresh gale every day, and there's
but two points of Land by which a man may fetch
into any part of the Bay; also the Bay lies
open to the Sea from the East, Southerly to the
<HI>W. S. W.</HI> I called for my Lieutenants and Master,
and acquainted them, that I had Orders to sail
from thence to the Coast of <HI>America</HI> to the South∣ward
of the River of <HI>Plate,</HI> to the streights of
<HI>Magellan,</HI> through which we were to pass into the
South Seas, and that we must shape our Course to
make the shortest way of it, and be careful to keep
Easterly enough of it, to weather the shoals of
<HI>Brazil,</HI> called the <HI>Abroholls,</HI> lying in and about
eighteen degrees of Southerly Latitude, for the
Wind blows for the most part thereabouts between
the Latitude of ten South, and the Latitude of
twenty South, at East by South, and East South-east
fresh gales; whilst this pass'd, in came the Ma∣ster,
and told me all things were stowed, and the
Wind at <HI>E.</HI> b. <HI>N.</HI> fresh; I concluded with him that
our best Course at present would be South and by
East, and as we got Southerly and the Wind grew
large, we might alter our Course when we would:
we steered a Point or two from the Wind, that
the Ship might have fresh way through the Sea. I
ordered my Master to steer South and by East
by the Compass, and my Lieutenant to call all
hands to Prayer, read Service, and beg'd of God
Almighty a prosperous Voyage, continuance in
Health, and love to one another, <HI>and that we might
prosper in this Vndertaking,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>Instructions for Mr. Humphrey Fleming, Com∣mander
of his Majesty's hired Pink the Batche∣lour;
By vertue of an Order from His Royal
Highness, dated the twenty ninth day of August
1669. to me directed.</HEAD>
<P>YOU are hereby required to sail with his Ma∣jesties
hired Pink the <HI>Batchelour,</HI> which you
are Commander of, and to keep Company with
his Majesties Ship the <HI>Sweepstakes</HI> to the Coast of
<HI>America</HI> to the Southward of <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> and
along the Coast of <HI>America</HI> to the Southward, till
you come to the Strights of <HI>Magellan,</HI> lying in
about 53 Degrees of South Latitude; through
which you are to pass into the South Sea, and sail
along the West Coast of <HI>America</HI> Northerly, till
you come as high as <HI>Baldavia,</HI> which lies in about
40 Degrees of South-lat▪ there you shall receive
further Orders from me, or in my absence, from the
Commander in Chief on board his Majesties Ship
the <HI>Sweepstakes,</HI> in case you keep Company with
her, whose Company you are not to depart from
or leave, upon any occasion whatsoever, as you will
answer the contrary at your peril, unless you have
Order from me so to do, or in my absence from
the Commander in Chief on board her; You are
also to understand, that you are to be employed by
me as I shall see occasion to employ you, to disco∣ver
Lands, Bays, Havens, Rivers or Streights, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="27"/>
The Design of this Voyage on which you are
employed, being to make a Discovery both of the
Seas and Coasts of that part of the World, and if
possible to lay the foundation of a Trade there.
You are not to meddle with the Coast of <HI>America,</HI>
nor send on shore, unless in case of great necessi∣ty,
till you get to the Southward of <HI>Rio de la
Plata;</HI> and you are not to do any injury to such
<HI>Spaniards</HI> as you shall meet with, nor meddle with
any place where they are planted: You are to
take Observations with as much Accuracy as you
can, and also to cause your Mate and Company to
do the like, to observe all Headlands, Islands,
Bays, Havens, Roads, Mouths of Rivers, Rocks,
Shoals, Soundings, Courses of Tides, flowings and
settings of Currents, where you come, both in the
North and South Seas, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and cause Draughts
and Designs to be made of them; and also you
are to take notice of all Trade-Winds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> you
meet with, and of the Weather, and especially
to observe Harbours in the Streights of <HI>Magellan;</HI>
You are in all places where you land to observe
the nature of the Soil, and what Fruits, Woods,
Grains, Fowls, and Beasts it produces, and what
Stones and Minerals, and what Fish the Rivers and
the Sea doth abound with; You are to do your
utmost to procure of the Minerals to carry to <HI>Enggland,</HI>
and to deliver them to His Royal High∣ness's
Secretary. You are also to mark the tem∣per
and inclinations of the <HI>Indian</HI> Inhabitants, and
where you can gain any Correspondence with
them, you are to make them sensible of the great
<PB N="11" REF="27"/>
Power and Wealth of the Prince and Nation
to whom you belong, and that you are sent on
purpose to set on foot a Trade, and to make
Friendship with them; but above all for the Ho∣nour
of our Prince and Nation, you are to take
care, that your Men do not by any rude behavi∣our
or injuries to them, create an Aversion in them
to the English Nation; but that on the other side
they endeavour to gain their Love by kind and
civil Usage toward them, and whosoever shall act
otherwise, you are to correct him or them for so
doing, which you are to acquaint your Men with,
that they be not ignorant. You are to be careful
of your Provisions and Liquor, and to husband it
to the best advantage, that there be no wastful
Expence made of it, nor of your Ships Furniture,
as Sails, Anchors, Cables, and Rigging, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
that you endeavour at all places where you come
to get Provisions, Wood and fresh Water, so as you
do not endanger your Ship and Men, which you
are to be very careful of, and in no cause to ex∣pose
any one of your Men to the hazard of his
Life, but always be careful that they be well
guarded, and be watchful, for there have been
many cut off by their own neglect. You are
to be careful to keep a good Command aboard
over your Men, and in case any mutinous pra∣ctice
happen under your Command, you are
forthwith to make it known to me. You are to
be careful to have your Ship kept sweet and
clean for the preservation of your Men's healths:
And God prosper us.</P>

means to endeavour to meet again, that is to say,
by looking well abroad at Sea, and so to observe
the Order in your failing Instructions, to know
each other at sight: the next Post of Rendezvouz
will be at <HI>Port St. Julian,</HI> which is on the coast
of <HI>America,</HI> as is said before; you are to make all
the hast that you can thither, and to stay for the
<HI>Sweepstakes</HI> there two whole Months, if you get

you; In your way thither, after you have pas∣sed

shall come to any place and be gone again before
you come thither, I will leave a piece of Board
nailed to a Pole or a Tree, engraven, mentioning
the Ship's name, and the day of my departure,
and the next Port I intend to go to; I desire you
would do the same, and at <HI>Port St. Julian</HI> I will
do likewise, and also leave an Order for you tied
to a Pole, being put in a glass Bottle; the Pole
shall be placed on the Island which lies in the Har∣bour
at the West end thereof, where I shall build
a Tent; pray be careful to look for it, and I shall
do the same for you; it may be I may have an
opportunity to touch on the Coasts as I sail a∣long,
if I can find any Trade with the Natives;
you may be sure where ever I come to find those
Memorials of my being there before you; so God
prosper our Intentions.</P>

Bonetto's, Sharkfish, and Albycores, a Fish
larger than a Bonetto, but of that Mackrel shape,
and feaverish Diet, they live upon the flying
Fish like the Bonetto's; to day we caught some
of them with Hooks, and one Shark; our Men
eat them both, and account the Shark a good
Fish.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 7. To day the Cooper found two
Buts of Beer had leaked out: this day all of us
drank Water only, for it was ever my order that
the meanest Boy in the Ship shoud have the same
allowance with my self, so that in general we all
drank of the same Cask, and eat one fort of pro∣vision,
as long as they lasted: I never permitted
any Officer to have a better piece of Meat than
what fell to his lot, but one blinded with a Cloth
serv'd every Man as they were called to touch

Southerly by 12 Miles than the Log allows; I can't
perceive any variation, and the Log is well kept,

Compass, and came to North; with much thun∣der,
lightning, and some rain; very dark Clouds,
cold hasey Weather; several spots of Sea-weeds
driving in the Sea, and a great many Sea-fowls of
a brown colour swimming in it: smoath Water;

<P>All the Albycores, Bonettos, and flying Fish

Whales.</P>
<P>Tuesday <HI>February</HI> 1. Cloudy foggy Weather
this Morning, and little Wind at South-east. I
stood to the South-westward, I saw abundance
of Sea-fowl flying to and fro; striking about
the weeds for small Fish, several beds of Sea∣weeds
driving by the Ship; it fell calm this Af∣ternoon;
many small Shrimps about the Ship, and
eight young Seal-fishes close to it; they were as
big as an ordinary Spaniel-dog, of a black co∣lour,
and went away to the Westward; this Af∣ternoon
a fresh gale at South-south-east; I steer'd
<PB N="18" REF="31"/>
away Southward and by West by my Compass;
the Air was cold here on a sudden, as 'tis in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
in <HI>September.</HI> These Seas are very much ex∣posed
to sudden Gusts and variable Winds, for
the Wind has run round the Compass twice or
thrice a day these 3 day, the Sea-water is chang∣ed
whiter then the usual colour, whence I conje∣cture,
I must be in Soundings, also by my account
of Longitude, kept from the <HI>Lizard,</HI> I am not
1 <HI>d.</HI> 28 <HI>m.</HI> off from land, according to <HI>Mercator</HI>'s
Draught: This Evening I sounded, but had no
ground at 130 Fathom; Wind at South a fine
gale: I steer'd in West-south-west; at ten a Clock
to Night, I observed the Water to riple as if it
were over a shoal, and had ground at seventy
Fathom; I caused the Head-sails to be braced to
the Mast, and sounded; sine red Sand inclining
to gray at 70 Fathom.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 2. Meridian distance from the <HI>Lizard,</HI>

Wind this Afternoon, and fair Weather; we lay
sometimes one way, sometimes another; Wind at
South-west and by South a small gale. I hoisted
out my Boat, and sounded, but no ground at 140
Fathoms; I tried the Current with my Boat, but
found little or none worth notice: the Sea ripled
in many places; I sounded on them, but no ground
at 108 Fathom; several Beds of Sea-weed driving
to and fro in knots; these Weeds are five or six
Fathom long, in strings, with broad leaves on
them of a brown colour, at the root hangs a Clod
or Rock of 2 or 3 pound weight; several Sea-Fowls
<PB N="19" REF="31"/>
flying and swimming near the Ship; be∣ing
quite clam, my Men kill'd some of them with
their Birding-pieces, for they were very tame,
not moving at the report of of a Gun; they are
very like to Sea-Gulls, and good meet; some Seals
and Whales seen.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 5. were seen several beds of Rock-weed,
and Sea-Fowls, much like Gannets; some
black, others white, pied, and grey; small Seal-fishes
like so many Dogs, for their Heads resemble
Bull-dogs, which they'l keep above Water a long
time, and look at the Ship; they are very nimble
at diving and skipping out of the Water: This
Afternoon at seven a Clock I was in the Latitude
of 41 degrees South, and Longitude, West
from the <HI>Lizard</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> 52 deg. and 50 min.
and in Meridian distance▪ from the <HI>Lizard</HI> 895

36 <HI>d.</HI> 34 <HI>m.</HI></P>
<P>This Night I advised with <HI>Don Carolus</HI> where
it would be best for us to hale in with the Land,
in what Latitude, or at what Cape or Harbour on
this Coast of <HI>America,</HI> being now to the South-ward
of the River of <HI>Plate,</HI> and according to my
Instructions, before the Coast to be discover'd,
and a Trade set on foot with the Natives; He
told me I might do what I would, for he did not
understand the Coast, nor where 'twas inhabited;
'twas his whole Discourse in the Voyage, that
he had been here in a Galley, and knew all the
Coasts from the River of <HI>Plate</HI> to the <HI>Streights,</HI>
and thorow the <HI>Streights</HI> all along the West Coast
<PB N="20" REF="32"/>
to <HI>Baldavia</HI> and <HI>Lima;</HI> being arrived here, as far
as I can perceive by him, he knows nothing of
the matter, nor any thing appertaining to Navi∣gation;
all I can fancy of him is, that he may
have liv'd with a West-<HI>Indian</HI> Governour, whom
he has heard talk of these Parts.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 8. at 7 a Clock this Afternoon the
Wind came to the West South-west, a stiff gale. I
stood to the Southward; much Rock-weed pass'd
by the Ship to day, and several Sea-Fowls seen;
very cold for the Season, being Summer, which
<HI>Don Carolus</HI> began to complain of, and told me,
he did not think we should have come so far
Southerly; I shew'd him by my Plates how
far we were to go through the <HI>Streights,</HI> and a∣long
the West Coast; he said, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> went
to <HI>Chile</HI> a nearer way; I answer'd, 'twas into
the River of <HI>Plate</HI> and over Land, which we
could not do.</P>
<P>My Company are all in good health, but some
of a puny Race grow weak in being so long on
Shipboard; I give them Vinegar once a Week,
which is very good to prevent the Scurvy in their
Mouths; also I order'd every Man to wash his
Mouth, Face and Hands before the receive his
daily Allowance of Bread, and appointed one
Man to see it performed; if any neglected it, the
Steward kept their Allowance for one day; like∣wise
every Man is commanded to keep himself
clean, and free from Lice, upon forfeiture of his dai∣ly
Allowance to the Party accusing him; by these
means the Ship is kept neat, sweet and clean, tho'
the dirty foggy Weather is a great Enemy to this
Discipline.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="32"/>
<HI>February</HI> 19. I sounded often to day, and had
fifty and fifty three Fathom; dark black Sand
wth some bright fine Sand in it; Beds of Rock-weed,
Seals, and Porpoises, such as are in the <HI>Eu∣ropean</HI>
Seas, seen to day; three Whales, many
Fowls flying about▪ and some Penguins in the
Sea, swimming near the Ships; at 2 a Clock in
the Afternoon the Wind was at <HI>E.</HI> b. <HI>S.</HI> a stout
gale and a great Sea; I stood to the Southward, close
haled under my Courses; the Pink half a Mile to
Wind-ward of me udner her's; she out-sails us
now it blows, and puts us past our Top-fails, and
steers along with us with only her Main-sail set;
the Sea runs lofty.</P>
<P>Monday <HI>February</HI> 21. At a quarter of an hour
past eight this Morning I saw the Land bearing
West of me, and distant about 4 Leagues: I
sounded, and had 21 Fathom; small Stones and
Sand; still I stood in West by my Compass. The
Land makes but an ordinary heighth towards the
Sea side, but farther up, round high Hills, and
looks reddish; the Northermost Land I could see,
which was <HI>Cape Blanco,</HI> bore North-north-west of
me about two Leagues, and the Southermost
Land at the face of the Cape.</P>
<P>The Land trented away to te Southward of me
Southwesterly, of an ordinary height by the Water
side, but up in the Land are Hills like Tables on the
top, a little higher than the rest; the Land makes
in Hills and Valleys all along, like Downs of an
ordinary heighth; at nine a Clock this Morning I
braced the Head-sails to the Mast, and lay so half
an hour till the Fog cleared up, that I might make
<PB N="22" REF="33"/>
the Land plainly, being within five miles of the
shore side, which made a kind of Bay, breached
on the shore; I sounded, and at 17 Fathom had
rough ground, with some small stones drawn up
in the Tallow of the Lead, which was dinted by
Rocks; between nine and ten a Clock there was
a fine clear, by which I saw the Land very plain∣ly;
it look'd reddish like seared Grass; no Woods
to be seen on any of the Hills or Valleys, but all
as bare as the Grass-Downs in <HI>England;</HI> I durst
not send my Boat a-shore for fear of losing her in
the Fog, or being sunk at the shore, whereon the
Sea breaks very much: the Wind was at North
and by East; a fresh gale blew almost along the
shore, and being out but 24 hours before, made
the Sea run high; the Land lies by the Sea-side
South-south-west, and North-north-east, as far as
I could see to the Southward; no fire or smoak
to be see upon the Land.</P>
<P>Course made true after several Courses, from
yesterday Noon till to day at nine a Clock, when
I was 3 Leagues off the Land; true Course is

<P>I concluded we had shot past <HI>Port Desier</HI> Har∣bour
in the Fog, for the Islands and Rocks which
we saw, were <HI>Penguin,</HI> and other Isles lying about
it, which lies to the Southward of the Harbour of
<HI>Port Desier.</HI> Many Seals, Penguins, pied Porpoises,
and several Sea Fowls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> seen to day.</P>
<P>Thursday <HI>Febr.</HI> 24. Hasey Weather; Wind at
West-north-west, a fresh gale. I sent Men up to
the Top-mast-head to look abroad; this Morn∣ing
no sight of the Pink; I judge she must be in
<HI>Port Desier:</HI> I weighed about 8 a Clock this
Morning, and stood to the Northward with my
Ship; I went in my Pinnace along the shore to the
Northward, whilst the Ship sail'd in the Offing,
about two Leagues from the shore: the Shore∣side
is in Beaches and scatter'd Rocks; in many
places the Tide of Flood was with us: at the
North-end of <HI>Seals Bay,</HI> lies a small rocky Island
copling up like a Haycock. It is cover'd with
grey-colour'd Fowls Dung; a very strong Tide
runs here, between the Island and the Main, 'tis
a little more than a Cables length from the Point
of the Main; there's a great many broken Rocks
about it by the Sea-side; here the main Land is
low and sandy, up the Country in large Downs
and Hills; without Wood or fresh Water any
where: On this Island are abundance of Seals, and
Sea Fowls; we gave it the name of <HI>Tomahauke</HI> I∣sland,
from an <HI>Indian</HI> Club lost here, called by the
<HI>Caribbe-Indians</HI> at <HI>Surinam</HI> a <HI>Temahauke,</HI> 'tis all a
craggy Rock, a little bigger than <HI>Seal-Island,</HI> and
<PB N="24" REF="34"/>
is eight Leagues to the North-north-east: distant
from it to the Northwest of this Island, is a deep
rounding Bay, called in the Charts <HI>Spiring's Bay,</HI>
wherein lie three small Islands of an indifferent
height: the Land, in the Country over this Bay
is large high Hills, Rocks lie in the North part
of the Bay; I cross'd it in the Pinnace, amd sound∣ed
as I went over, and had 21 Fathom, rough
ground in the mid-way: 'tis seven Miles broad,
and near 3 Leagues deep; it rounds with a turning
up to the North-northwest ward, behind a Point
farther than I saw; upon which rounding Point
stand black Rocks, which make like a ragged
Building, and a Tower in it: at my coming in
with the Land, I sail'd close under this shoar with
my Boat; the shore is steep, black Rocks, and
low Bays, with Pebble-stones and sandy Beaches;
green Grass on the Hills, no Wood nor fresh Wa∣ter
to be seen; at the North-east Point of this
<HI>Spiring's-Bay,</HI> the Land makes out full like a fore∣land;
a fair high Land in large plain Hills, with
sandy small Bays; at the face of this Foreland
lie six rocky Islands; one is a Musket-shot off the
Main, the rest farther off; the outwardmost is the
biggest, a Mile from the Point of the Main, and
is called <HI>Penguin-Island;</HI> it is indifferent high at
the ends and low in the middle; 'tis near three
quarters of a Mile long, North-north-east and
South-south-west, and near half a Mile broad East
and West; it is all craggy Rocks, except in the
lowest part of the middle, which is gravelly, and in
the Summer time had a little green Grass; the great
black Gannets lay their Eggs here, and the Pen∣guins,
<PB N="25" REF="34"/>
all over the Island upon and under the
Rocks in Holes; Seals lie all about the sides, on
the tops of the highest Rocks and in the middle
of it; the number of Seals, Penguins, and Sea-Fowl
upon these Islands, is alsmost incredible to
them that never saw them; for the multitude of
each Creature that's there daily, is numberless
the Six Islands are full of Seals, but the Penguins
frequent the biggest most; I put a-shore at one of
them, and took into my Boat three hundred Pen∣guins,
in less than half an hour, and could have
taken three thousand in the time, if my Boat
would have carried 'em, for 'tis but driving 'em
in flocks to the shore, by the Boats side, where
two or three Men knock them on the head with
short Truncheons, and the rest heave them into
the Boat; the Seals will run over a Man, if he does
not avoid 'em; mean time the Ship was standing
to the Northward; about 2 Leagues off many
broken Rocks and foul ground lie among these
Islands, and without the Point of the outermost it
makes a great ripling, which is the strength of
the Tide, reversed from the Islands aginst the o∣ther
Tide; to the Northward of these Islands is
a Bay, four Leagues long, and a League and half
deep; in the Northwest thereof lies the Harbour of
<HI>Port Desier,</HI> which we could see from <HI>Penguin Island's</HI>
bearing North-north-west from <HI>Penguin Island,</HI> di∣stant
about 3 Leagues: about the middle of this
Bay are steep white Cliffs, near two miles long;
the upper part of the Cliff has black streaks
down a fourth part, caused by the Water drain∣ing
down on it; the Land is plain on the top of
<PB N="26" REF="35"/>
these Cliffs but further into the Country high
rounding Hills and Downs, and toward the Wa∣ter-side
low; on the South part of the Bay are
craggy Rocks on the Main like great Walls; near
the Sea there's a sandy Cove, to hale a Boat
up in foul Weather; the Cove is just under these
wall-like Rocks.</P>
<P>Saturday <HI>Feb.</HI> 26. Fair Weather, the Wind at
West, a stiff gale. I kept a Light out all Night,
that the Pink might see if she came along; the
first part of the Night a great Fire was made on
the shore for the same purpose: Cold weather:
this Morning at 7 a Clock I manned both my
Boats, and into the Herbour; the Ship rode
moored at the Harbour-mouth, within the Muscle-bank,
in six Fathom at low Water; I sent my Men
upon the Hills on the North shore to look a∣broad
for the Pink, and make a Fire in the dry
Grass, that she might see the smoak if she were
thereabouts, but they could not see her; I sound∣ed
the Harbour in many places to day at low Wa∣ter,
and found it a very good one for great Ships
to ride in, provided they have good Cables and
Anchros; I searched the shore, but found no
Wood, and very little fresh Water; on the hilly
and large Downs, very few Bushes, but dry; long
Grass growing in tufts and knots; the Soil is
gravelly and dry, in some Valleys well mixt with
black mould; no People, fire or smoak but our
own to be seen; I saw several places where they
had lain, behind Bushes upon Grass, which they
had plucked up, and that they had made small
sires, and roasted Lumpets and Muscles; there
<PB N="27" REF="35"/>
lay Wooll, Feathers, bones of Beasts, and shivers
of Flints; I went to a Flag which I left on a Hill
yesterday with Beads at it, but finding no body
had been at it, let it stand; no Beasts seen any
where, except two Hares running over the Hills:
this day we were taken up with viewing the Har∣bour,
so that we did not advance above a mile and a
half into the Land: in the Valleys between the
Rocks grows abundance of wild Pease, which had
green leaves and blewish blossoms, both tasting like
green Pease-leaves in <HI>England,</HI> growing on vines and
tangled together; also very sweet smelling Herbs
much like Tares, very green, and white and yel∣low
Flowers, likewise green Herbs much like Sage,
but grow in knots near the ground like Lettice;
these Herbs with the Pease-leaves, made a good
Sallad to refresh such as were inclining to the
Scurvy; for want of which fresh Trade several of
my Men were falling into it. Here are abundance
of very good Muscles, and Limpets on theRocks,
and an Island frequented by many Seals, and
Fowls; in the River were pied Divers as big as
Ducks, some of them grey and black shags; Ducks
and other Sea-Fowls breed on them amongst the
Rocks and Bushes: to day I went upon one of
these Islands, and caught as many young black
Shags in their Nests as loaded the Pinnace: when
I have discovered better the particulars of the
Fowls and other things seen here, I will mention
them hereafter: Night coming on, and it begin∣ning
to blow hard, I went aboard with Herbs,
Fowls, and what else I had got to day; and di∣vided
all things equally among the Company, the
<PB N="28" REF="36"/>
Boys Dividend being as large as my own, or any
Man's; it blew very hard this Evening, and look∣ed
very black in the South-west, an ordinary gale;
I kept a Light out all Night in the Poop for the
Pink: this day all the Company eat of young
Seals, and Penguins, and commended them for
good Food; I judged this a very fit Harbour to
fit the Ship in, for the main Mast must be un∣rig'd,
and a new gang of shrouds fitted, and Bal∣last
be had; and it might be a means to fall in
with the Pink, for from the tops of the Hills
we could see a great way into the Sea, so that if
she should come near the Coast, we could not
miss her.</P>
<P>We found 2 Springs of fresh Water, one in a
Valley close by the Water-side, in a gully above
the Ship, half a mile up the River; the other up
a Valley between the Rocks, just a-brest where
the Ship rode, about half a mile from the River's
side, right from <HI>Coopers-Bay</HI> in the same Valley;
these Springs are but small, and the Water's a little
brackish or saltish, for in the dry Valleys the
Earth is naturally saltish; the Ground and Rocks
have a white Rhime of Salt-petre hanging on them;
I went into the Land 2 miles North-west, and
saw the Country hilly, and dry Land without
Wood or Water; some craggy Rocks and Valleys
low, but dry and of a Salt-petre nature; here and
there some Bushes with prickly Branches, and
Leaves like White-Thorn Bushes in <HI>England;</HI> the
lesser Bushes have small dry Gauls growing o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
them, with a small dry Seed as hot in the Mouth
as Pepper; not a Tree to be seen: the Soil is gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>
velly and sandy generally, with tufts of dry fear∣ed
Grass growing on it; I digged in several places
but saw nothing but gravelly Sand and Rocks;
no sort of Metals or Minerals; I looked also among
the broken Rocks for Metals, but saw no
sign of any; from the tops of the Hills I could
see a great way into the Land, which is all
Hills and Downs like <HI>Cornwall:</HI> toilsom travelling
to those that were not used to it; I could travel
as far in an hour as many of my Men could in
two; to day we saw nine Beasts feeding on the
Grass, very like Deer, but larger, and had longer
Necks, but no Horns; reddish coloured on the
Back and aloft, whitish under their Bellies and up
their Flanks; when we had got within a Fur∣long
of them they fell a neighing like Horses, one
answered another, and then all run away.</P>
<P>Tuesday <HI>March 1.</HI> Fair Weather this Morning,
Wind at North, a fine gale and a cold Air. This
Forenoon I filled the Casks out of the Spring, and
dug them deeper; I set up a long Pole with a
white Cloath upon it, on a Hill near a mile into
the Land, where 'twas most likely to be seen by
the Inhabitants; with it I left Beads, a Looking-glass,
a Knife, a Hook and an Hatchet, to invite
the People of the Country to shew themselves, for
I was willing to see 'em, that I might discover
what they had; but through I went about the
Hills this Afternoon, I could see neither People,
Fire, nor Smoak. I saw three Ostriches, but could
not get near enough to make a shot at them; they
were feeding on Grass, and at first sight of me ran
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>way; I had a Greyhound with me, which I turn'd
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>
loose upon 'em, who gave Chase to one of them,
and at last gave her a turn, which she recovered,
took to the Hills, and so escaped; they are grey
coloured, and larger than a great Turky-cock in
<HI>England;</HI> they can't fly, but have long Legs, and
trust to their running: I saw two handfuls of
Wooll among the Grass, where the Natives had
made a Fire; it was the <HI>Spanish</HI> red Wooll, which
they bring out of <HI>India,</HI> and very fine; I brought
it away with me, and set the Greyhound at 3 of
the large Beasts like Deer, but they were too swift
for him: Night coming on I returned on Board; at
7 a Clock this Night the Wind came to the North,
a fresh gale, and hasey Weather; no sight of
the Pink to day: I could see a long way on the
Sea: at 10 a Clock it rain'd, and the Wind came
to the South-East.</P>
<P>Friday <HI>March 4.</HI> Fair Weather this Morning,
the Wind at East, a fine gale, I went ashore and
filled fresh Water, the rest of the Seamen fitted rig∣ging;
this day at 12 a Clock I went with both the
Boats, and forty Men to <HI>Seal-Island,</HI> into the Har∣bour,
every Man with his Staff and Club; we
landed, drove the Seals up together, beset them
round, and in half an hours time killed four hun∣dred
young and old; striking them on the head
kills them presently; as soon as they were knock∣ed
down we cut their throats, that they might
bleed well whilst they were hot; then loading both
the Boats with them, I carried them to the Bay
where the Tent was, landed, and laid them upon
the Rocks; to Night the Boat fetch'd them all off:
the great Male Seals are as big as Calfs and re∣semble
<PB N="31" REF="37"/>
a Lion in their shaggy Necks, Heads, and
Faces, as well as in their Roar; the Females are
like Lionesses before, only they are hairy all over
like a Horse, and smooth, and the Male is smooth
all over his hind-parts; their shape is very deform∣ed,
for their hind-part tapers till it come to a
point, where grow two Fins or Feet, two more
grow out of their Breast, so that they can go on
Land a great pace, and climb Rocks, and Hills of
a good height; they delight much to lie and sleep
ashore; some are very large, upwards of eigh∣teen
Foot in length, and thicker about than a But
in the Bilge, and excessive fat; there are thousands
fourteen foot long, the common sort are about
five foot and all very fat; they'l gape at you when
you come to them, as if they would devour you,
and 'tis labour enough for two Men to kill one
of the great ones with a Hand-spike, which is the
best Weapon for that purpose.</P>
<P>Saturday <HI>March</HI> 5. Fair Weather, Wind at
South-west, a fine gale. This Morning we went a∣shore
to flay some Seals, and cut the Bodies in good
handsom pieces, and salted it up well in Bulk on
Deal-boards, ashore, that the blood might drain
from it; the Meat looks as well and as white as
Lamb, and is very good Victuals now, but when
'tis a little salt it will eat much better; those we
dress'd were all young Seals, for they sucked their
Dams, who as soon as they come ashore bleat, im∣mediatly
come her young ones, and bleat about
her like Lambs, and suck her; one old Female
suckles four or five, and beats away other young
ones that come near, whence I believe they have
<PB N="32" REF="38"/>
four or five at a time; the young ones which we
killed and eat were as big as a midling Dog; we
cut the fat off of the Great ones, and made Oil of
it for the Lamps, and other uses in the Ship; the
Oil of the young ones we fried, and eat with our
Provisions; it is very sweet and good to fry any
Food with; our Men will have it to be as good as
Olive Oil; most of my Men to day gathered of
those green Pease-leaves and other Herbs for Sal∣lads,
which some eat raw, some boiled; it is re∣freshing
to their Bodies.</P>
<P>Sunday <HI>March</HI> 6. Blowing Weather, Wind at
West: This day, after Prayers, I went ashore on
the South-side of the River, and travelled eight
miles into the Land, South-west and by West, ha∣ving
twelve armed Men with me; my Lieute∣nant
went up the River in the Boat nine or ten
miles, to see for People that way; my other Lieu∣tenant
went on the North-side with ten armed
Men to see for People, and view the Land; I
found in my Travels one of those great Beasts like
a Deer, dead and whole, the Vermin had not
touched him; all his Back had pretty long Wooll
of the colour of dried Rose-leaves, and down his
sides, his Belly white Wooll; he was as big as a
small Colt, he had a long Neck, a Head like a
Sheep, so was his Mouth and Ears; his Legs very
long, and Cloven-footed like a Deer, a short
bushy Tail of a reddish colour; no Horns nor e∣ver
had any, it was a Male: I believe these Beasts
are <HI>Peruvian</HI> Sheep; (<HI>Guianacoes</HI>) I had his Paunch
opened, and searched for the Bezoar-stone in it▪
and in the Pipe to the Stomach, I turned them in∣side
<PB N="33" REF="38"/>
outward, but found none; I had heard <HI>West-Indian
Spaniards</HI> say, that they have taken the
Bezoar-stone of Guianacoes, and therefore opened
this, which I take to be the same Beast: In tra∣velling
to day I saw several herds of them, some∣times
ten, thirty, or forty together; I could not
get near enough to shoot at them; they neigh
like young Horses, and so wander away: I saw
nine Ostriches, but they would not suffer me to
come within shot of them; I let the Greyhound
at them, but they out-run him up the Hills: we
saw a Fox, a wild Dog, and five or six Hares, of
which the Greyhound killed one; they are shaped
like <HI>English</HI> Hares, and much larger, and instead
of a Tail have a little stub about an inch long,
without Hair on it; they have holes in the ground
like Coneys: no Woods to be seen, only a few
Bushes like White-Thorns. The Land is dry, of a
sandy gravelly Soil, in large rounding Hills, not
very high, but in Downs and Valleys, bearing
nothing but Grass; here and there are gullies of
fresh Water in the Valleys, which is made in the
Winter-time when the Snow dissolves: I saw se∣veral
places of salt Water in the Land, which is
occasioned by the natural saltness of the Earth;
here are no Fruits nor Herbs: When I was at the
farthest, and on a Hill, I could not see any sign
of People, or Woods, but still Hills and Valleys
as far as we could descry; no Birds to be seen but
Kites, which are like those in <HI>Europe,</HI> and small
Birds like Sparrows, and Linnets; some Flies and
Humble-bees here: we saw some small four-foot∣ed
Animals running in the Grass; speckled-Grey,
<PB N="34" REF="39"/>
shaped like a small Creature in <HI>England</HI> called an
Eft, Newt or Lizard; no Adder nor Snake, nor any
venomous Creature; Cattle would live here very
well, such as Horses, Cows, Sheep, Goats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
Evening growing upon us, I returned to the Ship,
and 'twas within Night when we got aboard our
Boat, and ten a Clock when we entered the Ship;
I found on Board my Lieutenant that went up the
River, but they which went on the North-side
were not come back; up the River they saw five
small Islands, which had Sea-fowls on them and
Bushes for fewel; the River grows broader up∣wards
and has several Rocks in it; on the shoar
they saw Guianacoes, Ostriches, and Hares; no
People, Fire or Smoak; they saw where People
had been, and Fires made, and Muscles and Lum∣pets
roasted; no fresh Water nor Wood, nor any
Metal or Mineral; the Land hilly with Grass on
it: At twelve a Clock to Night those that went
on the North-side came aboard; they had been
about eight miles into the Land North-west, and
saw no People, but found where People had been,
and made Fires in the Grass, and Grass laid to
fire the Bushes; also where some had lain on open
places, and set little Bushes in Half-moons, to shel∣ter
them from the Weather; on the top of a Hill
they made a fire with Grass to see if any would
answer them; they sat down by it all day, but
could see none made any where else: the Land
is in rounding large Hills, not very high, but like
Downs, as the Coast of <HI>Yorkshire</HI> about <HI>Burling∣ton;</HI>
no Woods nor Trees seen, nor fresh Water;
here and there a Bush growing in a Valley; indif∣ferent
<PB N="35" REF="39"/>
good Grass; the Soil gravelly and sandy,
and some ridges of Rocks; they saw Guianacoes,
Ostriches, Hares, and Kites; several little Crea∣tures
like Efts; no kind of Fruit or Berry, Mi∣neral
or Metal: I charged them as they travelled
in any Gullies where Water had run to search for
grains of Gold, or other Metal, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for Gold is
found in grains in such Gullies, and much Gold
is found in the Land on the other side, not two
hundred Leagues distant from us; much Salt-pe∣ter
hangs on the Earth where Water has been, in
a kind of Flower; the plashes of Water they met
with were as salt as Brine, which the Earth made.
I saw Smelts here eighteen Inches long lying dead
on the Shore, but hitherto have not seen one
Oyster, or other shell-Fish, Crawfish, Lobster, or
Crab, though 'tis possible the place may have 'em
all. Whilst we were standing by the Water-side,
a Seal chased on shore a Fish as large as a Mackrel
and like a Mullet; one of the Men took it up, and
dressed it, when he came on Board, 'twas excel∣lent
good; here must be a great quantity of Fish to
maintain all the Seals, Penguins, and other Fowls
that live upon nothing else, and yet are all ex∣tream
fat, and innumerable in multitude; besides
what Creatures we have not seen yet; I have
seen Seals in this Harbour swimming with their
heads above Water, with large Fish in their
Mouths.</P>
<P>Sunday <HI>March</HI> 13. Indifferent Weather, Wind
at West, a fresh gale; The Air cold this Morning.
I went up the River in my Boat with fourteen
Men armed; I past the Island, where the brushy
<PB N="36" REF="40"/>
Bushes are, and where we took the young Shags;
there the River grows broader, near a mile from
the North shore over to the South, and conti∣nues
that breadth four miles, then it be∣comes
narrower, and turns away to the South-west;
at this turning is an Island of a mean height
and Rocky, bearing some small Bushes and Grass;
I went upon it, and saw a Post of five foot long
set up (it had been the timber of a Ship) with a
piece of Board about a foot square nailed to it,
at the foot of it one of my Men took up a piece
of Sheet-Lead, and gave it to me, it had this In∣scription
engraven on it,

In a hole of the Post lay a latten or tin Box,
(which we found by a long Plug that stuck in
the hole) with a sheet of written Paper enclosed
in it, but so eaten by the rust of the Box, that
'twas not to be read; I cut out with my Knife up∣on
a Board the Ship's Name, and the date of the
Year and Month, which I nailed to the Post; and
brought away the Lead with me, aud named the
place <HI>Le Mair's Island:</HI> we found on it several pie∣ces
of Boards, of the Wreck of some Ship, that
had been burned; they were drove up here by
the Tide; the People of the Country can't get
upon this Island: From hence I went on the North
side of the River two miles into the Land; no
Trees to be seen, but many Ostriches and Guiana∣coes
in many places; the Soil is marly and good,
the Hills not very high, but plain large Downs,
with Grass on them all over; digging in two or
three places I found sandy dry ground near a foot
deep, then Marle: In my opinion it might be
made excellent Corn-ground, being ready to Till;
'tis very like the Land on <HI>New-market</HI> Heath; no
People to be seen; I searched the Gullies and bro∣ken
Rocks, for grains of Gold or Minerals, but
found neither: I returned to the Boat again, row∣ed
farther under the shore, landed, and mounted
asteep high Hill to view the Country; on the top
of this rocky Hill grow small Bushes: I could see
the course of the River a long way further, and the
Land all Grass; here and there a white spot of
Marle on the side of a Hill; no People to be seen
nor Boats on the River; I came down to the Boat:
several Creeks run from hence a mile or two into
<PB N="38" REF="41"/>
the Land: I cross'd the River to the South-east
shore; we made the Boar fast in a Creek in a Val∣ley,
and went all hands up the Land three miles;
we saw many Guianacoes, and Ostriches, but could
not come within shot of them; I saw the Foot∣steps
of five Men that had been upon the Oar;
I measured my Foot with them, which was larger
and longer by half an Inch than any of them; we
could not see any People: it being near Night we
plucked up Grass, and laid it to the best advan∣tage
for shelter; here we lay all Night, keeping
watch two by two; cold Air to Night, wind at
West.</P>
<P>Monday <HI>March</HI> 14. Fair Weather but cold. This
Morning by day-light we turn'd out, and marcht
into the Land four miles South-west and by South;
we could not find any fresh Water; we made a
Fire on the Grass, but saw no sign of any People;
we saw <HI>Guianacoes,</HI> Hares, Foxes, wild Dogs, pretty
large, and a grey Cat like an <HI>English</HI> one, running
up the Hills: to day we caught an <HI>Armadillo;</HI> the
Dogs put her to ground; they have holes like Co∣neys;
we soon dug her out, 'twas as big as a great
Hedg-hog, and not much unlike one; the <HI>Arma∣dillo</HI>
is cased over the Body with a shell,shutting
one under another like shells of Armour; the
Dogs couls not hurt her: we saw Rats in many
places, and a kind of Polecat, with two white
streaks on the Back, all the rest black; our Dogs
killed two of them; they stink much, several O∣striches,
some Partridges and many Kites: the
Land in fair Hills without Wood or fresh Water;
the Soil a sandy Gravel with Grass all over it; no
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
Mineral or Metal seen. This afternoon we return∣ed
to our Boat, and went through a Creek two
miles long, which is dry at low Water, and
not more than thirty foot broad; it makes a fair
Island of a mean heighth, plain on the top, and
Grass growing all over it, but no Wood nor Wa∣ter
upon it; the greatest part of it is a sandy marly
Soil; 'tis two miles long, and half a mile broad;
the Greyhound killed two Hares on it presently,
and we saw above twenty; I called it <HI>Hare-Island;</HI>
it is adjacent to the South-shore; eight miles up
the River from the narrow, I went down the River
and went aboard: this Evening cold Air, Wind at
West, a stout Gale; towards Morning it came to
the North; I cannot perceive the <HI>Indians</HI> have any
Canoas or other Boats here.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 24. Blowing Weather, Wind at West.
We fetch'd all our things off the shore, and got the
Ship ready to Sail; I went a-shore on the South-side
to the peeked Rock, and found it a natural
Rock, standing on a small round Hill, as if it had
been built there by Man; it hath a Cleft on the
top it as big in circumference as a But: 'tis near
forty foot high above the Hill it stands on; about
it lie little lumps of Rocks; I saw nothing else
worth notice, so I return'd to the Ship; the big∣gest
stick growing in or near this Harbour, or in
the Countries as far as we went, which was twenty
Miles, would not make a Helve for a Hatchet, but
there are Bushes which will serve for firing at Sea:
before Night I had all things on Board, and the
Ship fitted with intent to sail next Morning, and
look'd along the Coasts for the Pink, till I arrived
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
at <HI>Port St. Julian's Harbour;</HI> fresh Water is scarce
in <HI>Port Desier Harbour</HI> in the Summer-time; the
places from whence I fetch'd Water, are small
Springs on the North-side, out of which I filled
near forty Tuns; the first Spring is on the North-side,
as you enter the Harbour half a mile up a
Valley, in a gully of Rocks: it bears North-north-west
from the lower Rock; that we called <HI>Peckets
Well,</HI> is a mile up the River, within a Bow-shot
of the salt Water, 'tis in a gully: the Land in these
Valleys has very green and sweet Grass, and a∣bundance
of wild Pease; small Nut-galls growing
on the Bushes, but in no great quantity, and but
few Bushes; Salt may be made here, for on the
Shore-side, and on the Rocks I gathered several
handfuls of good Salt.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 25. Gentlemen, You are by me desired
to take notice, that this Day I take possession of
this Harbour and River of <HI>Port Desier,</HI> and of all
the Land in this Country on both Shores, for the
use of his Majesty <HI>King Charles the Second, of Great
Britain,</HI> and his Heirs; God save our King, and
fired three Ordnance.</P>
<P>Saturday <HI>March</HI> 26. Wind at West, a stout
Gale. I stood to the Northward; this Morning
at six a Clock when the Sun appeared above the
East Horizon, the Moon set in the West-horizon,
being eclipsed at <HI>London</HI> at Elevan a Clock, ten
minutes in the Forenoon; but here at six a Clock
thirty minutes past, which gives four hours forty
minutes difference of time, between the Meridian
of <HI>London</HI> and the Meridian of <HI>Cape Blanco;</HI>
which Cape lies in the Latitude of 47 <HI>d.</HI> 20 <HI>m.</HI>

South; on the South-east Coast of <HI>America,</HI> where
I saw this Eclipse 70 degrees in Longitude to the
Westward of the Meridian of <HI>London,</HI> by this Ob∣servation;
I could not see the whole Eclipse the
Heavens being clouded; I find <HI>Cape Blanco,</HI> by
my account of Sailing, to lie in the Longitude of
69 <HI>d.</HI> 16 <HI>m.</HI> to the Westward of the Meridian of
<HI>London;</HI> If the Moon had not been clouded, I
might have been exact in the Longitude, but I

<P><HI>Cape Blanco</HI> lies in the Latitude of 47 <HI>d.</HI> 20 <HI>m.</HI>

<P>Saturday <HI>April</HI> 2. Fair Weather this Morning,
Wind at North-north-west, a fine gale. I filled
at Day-light, and steered away South-south-west,
and South and by West by my Compass, as the
Coast lies; I sailed along in twenty Fathom-wa∣ter:
black Sand distant from the shore near three
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>
Leagues: this forenoon at nine a Clock, I saw
a small flat Island to the Westward of me; about a
League off the Land; it lies in the Latitude of
48 <HI>d.</HI> 40 <HI>m.</HI> South; the Land against it is high, in
large Hills, and some round copling tops; two
Leagues more to the Southward, the Land is low,
in a great Plain, and a Beach by the Sea-side, but
the shore against this Island is rocky; I was two
Leagues East from the flat Island, and had twenty
three fathom black Sand; I haled close in for the
shore, and sail'd within five Miles of it; all along
from this Island to <HI>Port St. Julian</HI> I sounded as I
sail'd along, and had 18 or 20 fathom fine black
Sand; the Land is low in a Valley; the Sea-shore
is a Beach, here and there a Rock; it is in a long
Beach for four Leagues; after you are to the
Southward of the Flat-Island one League, the shore
lies South-fourth-west and North-north-east; at
the South-end of this Beach in-land are high round
Hills, but at the Sea-side is a steep white Cliff, of
an indifferent heighth with a black streak in it;
over the Cliff the Hill rounds up to the top, ha∣ving
some small black Bushes growing on the side;
no Wood or Tree seen.</P>
<P>In this Bay is <HI>Port St. Julian;</HI> the Harbour's
mouth is in the middle of the Bay, but you cannot
see it without, for one Point shutting in the other;
you must send your Boat in to discover the Har∣bour
at Low-water, and the Bar without, for 'tis a
barred Harbour: the Land in the Country over
<HI>Port St. Julian,</HI> on the West-side, is high copling
round Hills, like blunt Sugar-loaves on the top;
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is the highest Land I saw in all the Country,
<PB N="43" REF="43"/>
and there are no such Hills besides on the Coast;
the Land is plain to the South without any Hill,
as far as we could see at this time: this Afternoon
it proved a Calm; I anchored in the Bay before
St. <HI>Julian,</HI> in twelve fathom Water, black oary
Land, the Harbour's mouth bearing West-south-west
of me, about two Leagues off: I sent in my
Boat to discover the Harbour, and see if the Pink
was there, which returned to Night at six a Clock;
my Lieutenant told me there was a safe Harbour,
and Water enough for a bigger Ship, but no Pink,
nor any sign of her having been there; now I de∣spaired
of ever seeing her more, after my hopes
were frustrated here; nevertheless I doubted not
the success of my Voyage, though the Company
thought 'twould be dangerous being a lone Ship,
a stormy Sea to sail in, and unknown Coasts to
search out, and if we should happen to run a∣ground
any where, could expect no relief; these
suspicions I soon put out of their Heads, by telling
them of the great Riches of the Land, and that
<HI>Captain Drake</HI> went round the World in one Ship,
when in those days there were but ordinary Na∣vigators;
and was it for us to question our good
fortune, who beyond Comparison are better Sea∣men,
if we would put our selves in Action; and
for me, I would expose no Man to more danger
than my self in the Attempt. Calm to Night; I
rode fast, a small Tide running where I rode; the
Water ebb'd near three fathom perpendicular: it
is near nine Leagues from the <HI>Flat Island</HI> to <HI>Saint
Julian,</HI> South-south-west and North-north-east as
the shore lies.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="44"/>

<P>Wednesday
, <HI>April</HI> 13. Fair Weather, Wind at
West, a small gale. Frosty and cold Air, no sign
of the Pink: I went ashore and haled the Seyne
on the East-side; at the first of the Flood we
caught five hundred Fishes, as big as large Mul∣lets,
and much like them, grey, and full of Scales:
some as big as a Man's Leg; we caught them all
in four hours time, returned aboard, and divided
them among the whole Ship's Company; they eat
admirably well; many good Muscles lie on the
Rocks, and Oyster-shells on the Shore-side, and
growing in Veins on the Rocks, but no Meat in
them: Wind at West to Night, a fresh gale.</P>
<P>Monday <HI>April</HI> 18. Wind at South-west, a stiff
gale. Cold Air and some Snow this Morning; the
Winter is come strong and stormy, so that 'twill
be impossible to hold the Coast into the Streights;
for the Wind blows altogether from the West or
West-southerly, and in such Gusts as will force a
Ship off the Coast. This day I ordered my Purser
to serve the Company Brandy-wine for their Al∣lowance,
at a Quart <HI>per</HI> Week a Man: I got a
Boats lading of the Wood of the Country aboard
for firing; to Night it blew hard at South-west;
all the Company eat salt Seal, and Penguins for
their Allowance: sweet and very good Meat, and
keeps well and long in Salt.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="44"/>
Friday <HI>April</HI> 22. Wind at South-west, a stiff
gale, and cold Air. This Morning I went ashore on
the North-west side with twenty Men to the Salt-pond,
which is rusted all over like a Pavement,
with very white and good Salt, two Inches thick,
for two miles long: in <HI>February</HI> here's Salt e∣nough
to fill a thousand Ships; we filled two Bags
and laid up near two Tuns out of the Water, for
there was Water over the Salt, which began to
decay with the Rain and Weather beating on it:
at Night I returned aboard, we brought as much
Salt with us as filled a Punchion, very good white
Stone-salt, whiter than <HI>French</HI>-Salt, and of a very
pleasant smell; I saw some Guianacoes, and Ostri∣ches:
the Hills and Valleys dry Earth, and Grass
on them: on the higher Hills lies Snow, no Peo∣ple,
but many places where they had made fires,
and lain under a Bush for shelter; no Mineral or
Metal, Tree, or Fruit.</P>
<P>Wednesday, <HI>April</HI> 27. Close Weather, and little
Wind; a cold Air, it freezes hard, the Ice bears a
Man.</P>
<P>Thursday <HI>April</HI> 28. Wind at West and by
South, a fine gale, cold frosty Weather. We un∣rig'd
the Ship, and made all snug, intending to
Winter in this Harbour; the Ice will not suffer us
to pass the Streights; the Winds are so stormy, and
generally out of the Western quarter; the Nights
so long and cold, that the passage is impossible
this Winter. The Port I found safe to ride in, and
good refreshment to be had of Fowls: as Ducks,
Peekes, and Divers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In the Spring I may be
ready to sail to the Southward, when we shall
<PB N="46" REF="45"/>
have the year before us, and the Sun in the Sou∣thern
Signs, which will give long Days and short
Nights, and temperate Weather; Wind at North-north-east
this Evening, and Rain: it blew a great
storm to Night, the Boat sunk at the Ship's stern,
and lost the Oars: less Wind towards Night, and
veared to the West.</P>
<P>Friday <HI>May</HI> 6. Wind at West-north-west, a fine
gale. I went a-shore on the North-west side with
thirty Men, and travelled seven or eight miles up
the Hill, saw no People: the Land is great Grass-Downs
in most places; and on the tops of the
Hills, and in the Ground are very large Oyster-shells
they lie in Veins in the Earth, and in the firm
Rocks: and on the sides of Hills in the Country;
they are the biggest Oyster-shells that ever I saw;
some six, some seven Inches broad, yet not one
Oyster to be found in the Harbour; whence I con∣clude,
they were here when the Earth was form∣ed;
no sign of Mine or Metal, no Woods or Tree;
We found a good Spring of fresh Water up in the
Hills, it drains into salt Water-swashes: We saw
several Salt-water Ponds six miles in the Land,
made by the saltness of the Earth; we saw Ostri∣ches,
Guianacoes, and a Fox. I made a Fire on the
top of the highest Hill, but could see no answer;
I returned aboard with my Company very weary;
some of my Men fetched Salt to day: fair Wea∣ther
to Night.</P>
<P>Friday <HI>May</HI> 13. Indifferent Weather, Wind at
West-south-west, a fine gale. This day we fetch∣ed
Salt: a Gentleman of my Company, Mr. <HI>John
Wood,</HI> walking on the <HI>Island of Jusice,</HI> found three
<PB N="47" REF="45"/>
small pieces of Gold Wire in two Muscle-shells:
which Shells were made together by a green Gut∣string:
the Gold was to the value of two shillings
English, and had been hammered, the wire as big
as a great Pin.</P>
<P>Monday <HI>June</HI> 6. Cloudy cold Weather, Wind at
South-west, a fresh gale. This day I went a-shore
with sixteen Men, and travelled ten miles West
into the Land; the Hills there are covered with
Snow: 'tis very cold, we could not go any fur∣ther
for Snow; and the Air is so cold that we
could not endure to lie on the ground; on the
Hill that I was on, we could see nothing but Hill
beyond Hill; no Woods, nor Trees, nor Bushes,
all grass Downs: the Land is flat on the tops of
the Hills; fresh Water runs down in several places,
which is melted Snow, and when the Water leaves
running, there's no Snow. I saw many Guiana∣coes,
and Ostriches; no People or sign of any:
close by the Water-side we saw many places, where
they had lain on open Hills in the Snow, and some
places where they had killed and eat Guianacoes
and Ostriches; they make but small Fires with
little sticks; I do not find they roast their flesh at
them, for we saw some raw Flesh hanging to the
Bones, which they had gnawed with their Teeth:
their Fires are only to warm their Children's Fin∣gers,
as we imagine: I gathered some handfuls of
Guianacoes Wool that lay here; I am persuaded
these People must needs see us travelling to and
fro every day, but won't come near or be seen by
us: they live like wild Beasts, or rather worse, for
sometimes they must be in great want of Food;
<PB N="48" REF="46"/>
here's neither Fruit, Root, or Herb for it: The
Land is a dry gravelly Soil, with Sand, and in
many places a Marle two foot below the Surface;
the Grass, which is dry, grows in knots, not very
long but thick; in the Valleys the Earth is of a
Petery or nitrous Nature; Ostriches seen; no sign
of Metal or Mineral; I and my Company have
looked in most places where we travelled for it:
to Night we got down but very weary.</P>
<P>Tuesday <HI>June</HI> 7. clse dark Weather, Wind
at North-east and by East, a fair gale: a new
Moon to day, fine Weather to Night, but
cold; the Stars near the <HI>Pole Antartick</HI> are
very visible; some of the small Stars in the Con∣stellation
of little <HI>Hydra</HI> are near the <HI>Pole;</HI> Here
are many good Stars near the Pole, good for Ob∣servation,
of the first and second Magnitude: the
Star at the South-end of <HI>Ariadne,</HI> the Star at <HI>Hy∣dra's
Head;</HI> the Star in the <HI>Peacock's eye,</HI> and the
Stars in <HI>Tucan's bill,</HI> and the Stars in <HI>Tucan's thigh
and back;</HI> the stars in <HI>Grus's head and wing and
body;</HI> but the brightest Stars are the Stars in the
former foot of <HI>Centaurus</HI> and the <HI>Crosiers;</HI> the o∣ther
Stars are of the third, fourth and fifth Mag∣nitude:
The two Clouds are seen very plainly,
and a small black Cloud, which the foot of the
<HI>Cross</HI> is in, is always very visible when the Crosiers
are above the Horizon, as they are alway here
in these Latitudes. The Heavens in this South
Hemisphere are as the Heavens in the North He∣misphere;
but no Stars within eighteen degrees
of the Pole fit for Observation; no Pole-star, as
the Star in the Tail of the little <HI>Bear</HI> is in the
<PB N="49" REF="46"/>
North: the Air cold to Night, but very healthy
for stirring Men; I have not had my Finger ached
as yet; a Man hath an excellent stomach here; I
can eat Foxes and Kites as savourily as if it were
Mutton; every Fox and Kite as we kill, we eat,
which is ever now and then one killed. Nothing
comes amiss to our stomachs, not one Man com∣plains
of cold in his Head or of Coughs. Young
Men well grown and of good shape are most fit
for this Country, it being a dry and an hungry
Air, and Provisions to be got with pains. The
Ostriches are nothing so big as the Ostriches in
<HI>Barbary,</HI> nor of the Colour nor Feather; these are
grey on the Back, and shaggy Feathers of no use,
and the Feathers on their Bellies are whire; they
have long Legs and small Wings; they cannot
fly; they have a long Neck, and a small Head,
and beaked near like a Goose; they are much like
a great Turky-cock, and good lean dry Meat and
sweet: to Night I came aboard; it blew fresh at
west.</P>
<P>Wednesday <HI>June</HI> 22. Wind at West-north-west,
a stout gale. This day I went ashore on
the East-side, saw no People; this day Mr. <HI>John
Wood</HI> went ashore on the West side, and three Men
with him; they were armed; they travelled into
the Land West and by North about four miles;
where they saw seven People of the Country on
a Hill, making a noise and wafting them to the
Ship: Our Men went up the rise of the Hill to
them; three of the <HI>Indian</HI> Men came to Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>
with their Bows and Arrows in their Hands, and
a loose skin about their Bodies, and a Furr-skin
<PB N="50" REF="47"/>
about their Heads, and pieces of skins about their
Feet, and all the other parts of their bodies na∣ked;
they were painted red and white on their
Faces; they would not come so near as to let our
Men touch them, but slepped back as you mo∣ved
forward; they continuing their noise, and
wafting with their Hands towards the Ship, and
and kept talking, but no Man could understand
them: they repeated <HI>Ozse, Ozse,</HI> very often; they
have an harsh Speech and speak in the Throat;
they received any thing that you cast to them on
the ground. Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> gave them a Knife, and a
Shas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and a Neckcloath, and a bottle of Brandy:
they would not drink; Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> could not per∣ceive
any Bracelets they had, or any thing about
them save their Skin: they are people of a middle
stature, and well-shaped; tawny Olive-colour'd,
black Hair, not very long: they seem to be of a
rude behaviour, for they returned nothing for
what they received, nor took no notice of any
thing; the rest of their Company stayed at the
Hill: they can endure much cold, for their Legs,
Buttocks, and lower parts are naked. Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>
was taller than any of them, and he judged the eld∣est
of the three to be upwards of forty years old,
the other thirty. They seemed to be very fearful;
they took their own time, and went away into the
Land. Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> returned aboard and acquaint∣ed
me with what he had seen. This Night we
saw a Fire in the Hills. It blew hard to Night at
West. They have small Dogs with them; they
would not have come near our People, if they had
not fallen accidentally in the Hills and Valleys
<PB N="51" REF="47"/>
with them. I have thought that they have heard
of the cruel dealings of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and dare not
trust us.</P>
<P>Saturday <HI>July</HI> 2. Wind at West, a fine gale. I
went a-shore on the East-side; we killed a great
Guianacoe with the Greyhound. I looked in his
Paunch for the Bezoar-stone, but found nothing.
I travelled to and fro but saw no people: I saw
where People had made earthen Pots, and had
glased them, for there lay some of their stuff run
together: at Night I went aboard.</P>
<P>Sunday <HI>July</HI> 3. Wind at South, close Weather.
The Guianacoe weighed, cleaved in his Quar∣ters,
two hundred and fifty pounds neat. He
served all the Company for a days Flesh, and is
good Meat.</P>
<P>Tuesday <HI>July</HI> 12. Close Weather, and little
Wind at North and by West. I went up to the
head of the Harbour, but saw no People: There
is in the Fullers-Earth Cliffs at the head of the
Harbour, a Vein made like rotten Ising-glass; I
took some out, but cannot find it good for any
thing: I digged in the Cliff, but saw nothing to
be taken notice of. I saw in two places pieces of
floor Timbers of a Ship; they have laid a long
time rotting. We saw that the biggest of these
Bushes here, have been cut down by some Chri∣stian
People. I saw wooden Plates, and a piece of
Cork, and a piece of an old Oar: some Christian
Ship had been here formerly. I lay ashore to
Night.</P>
<P>Sunday <HI>July</HI> 31. Fair Weather, Wind at South-west,
a stiff gale. The Weather as cold as it is
<PB N="52" REF="48"/>
in <HI>England</HI> in the height of Winter, and the Air
rather sharper and dryer; I have now twelve Men
lame with the cold, and their Legs and Thighs
are turned as black as a black Hat, in spots, the
cold having chilled the Blood; yet they use ba∣thing
and stuping those places, and all that they
can to prevent it, but it rather encreaseth on them
than otherwise: These are such people as I could
not make stir by an meyans; they that stir are as
well as any Men in the World can be.</P>
<P>Tuesday <HI>August 2.</HI> Close Weather, Wind at
South-west, a gale and cold Air. We fall on fit∣ting
of our Rigging and getting the Ship fit: Here
are hundreds of Guianacoes in companies near the
Water-side: my Greyhound is lame, so that I
cannot make her run; also here are many Ostri∣ches,
together with many green plovers at the
Watercr-side, and some Swans, but not full so large
as ours: They are white, save a black Head, and
half the Neck and Legs black: Here are some
white Geese, as <HI>European</HI> geese; the brant-Geese
are some whith, some black and grey; The Mal∣lards
and Ducks are grey; and the Teals are grey.</P>
<P>Tuesday <HI>August 16.</HI> Close Weather, Wind at
West and at North-west, a fine gale. I sent the
Boat for Water to a Swash on the East-side; two
of my Men saw two of the People of the Coun∣try
on the East-side behind a Bush; my Men went
toward them; they went away and left a bundle
of Skins under the Bush; my Men made signs to
speak with them, but they would not stay; m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Men did not go after them but sat down, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
would not stay; they were but of a middle st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ture:
<PB N="53" REF="48"/>
my Men brought the Bundle aboard to shew
it to me, and two mungrel Dogs, which were cou∣pled
together. I opened the Bundle and it was
several bags of Skins, with red Earth and white
Earth, and Soot or paint in a Bag: this is the
Trade they paint themselves with; they had
Flint-stones and Arrow-heads in the Bundle; I
searched the Bundle all over to see grains of
Gold, but could not find any: There were Brace∣lets
of Shells, and bits of Sticks, and braided
Thongs, and Arrows, and Muscle-shells, and Ar∣madillo-shells,
and a small point of a Nail in a
stick for a Bodkin: Their Skins were pieces of
Seal-skins, and pieces of Guianaco-skins, sewed
together with small Guts; all very old and full
of holes, and smelt of grease; There were pieces
of Flints made fast with a green Gut, in the split
of a Stick, which they hold fast to knock their Ar∣row-heads
into shape: There were also pieces of
Sticks to get Fire with. This was all that was in
the Bundle; it was made fast with Leather-thongs,
braided round like Whip-cord, and the Dogs
were coupled with such strings: The Muscle-shells
are their Knives. I put all things up in the
Bag, and made it fast. Their Dogs are much of
the Race of <HI>Spanish</HI> dogs; a good large mungrel
Cur, but very tame; any Man might handle them;
they were grey in colour, and painted red in spots:
they were very lean; there were two grcat Staves
of four foot long, which was tough Cane in short
joints: I carried them a-shore next day.</P>
<P>Tuesday <HI>August</HI> 30. Foggy close Weather this
morning, Wind at North. We travelled away
<PB N="54" REF="49"/>
West into the Land ten or twenty miles farther:
The Land all dry, with Grass, and Bushes in some
places like Thorns; the Hills high, and many,
and Snow on the tops; no Woods, nor Trees to
be seen; Fresh-water comes running out of the
Hills in fine Rivulet; no Fruit; many sedgy
Bushes grow on the Brink, and brave green Grass,
and a green Herb of a pretty strong hot taste;
some Teal in the Water, and Water-birds; this is
all I saw about the Rivulet. Many large Ponds
in the Country, but salt Water in those Ponds;
we saw Fowls like Herons, but all red; in the Val∣leys
we saw hundreds of Guianacoes in a compa∣ny,
and twenty Ostriches: some Heres and some
Partridges, greyer and bigger than ours; some
Snipes and small Birds; several Penne-wrens: we
saw several Kites, and small Hawks, and Owls;
we caught two Armadilloes; I saw two Foxes and
a wild Dog, and many brant-Geese: the Land is
in Hills and Valleys as far as we could see, and
bad travelling on foot; the Soil is gravelly and
dry sand, of a Salt-petre nature; the Grass in
some places long and dry, and in some places short
and dry; the Hills are rounding aloft like large
Downs: We red Earth in some places, such
as the <HI>Indians</HI> use; we saw the Footsteps of peo∣ple
in many places in the Clay, and places where
they had been, and had killed Guianacoes, and
made a fire there; I gathered Guianacoes-Wooll,
and Ostriches Feathers were scattered about the
place, and Bones: there lay the Skulls of three
People, no flesh on them; they were very clean,
and no larger than the Skulls of <HI>European</HI> Men;
<PB N="55" REF="49"/>
smooth and even Teeth, close set; one of those
Skulls was broken. Whether these people be
<HI>Man-eaters</HI> or not I cannot tell; I judge they have
Wars one with another, by reason here are so
few People in this great Land, and food enough
to live on, and the Land all clear and good Pa∣sturage
for Cattle, and no Mountains; in all the
Land there are Plains and grassy Meadows: here
wants only Wood to build with; it that were
here, it would be as good a Land as any part of
<HI>America,</HI> for the Counrry is very healthy. This
Afternoon it rained, and was very thick and fog∣gy,
so as we could not tell which way to go, al∣though
we had a Compass with us; for there is
no going into the Land without one, because a
Man will mistake his way, the Country is so open
in great Plains and Downs: We were very much
wet and cold; We got to Bushes, and there made
a Fire and dried our selves: we stayed here all
Night; we neither heard nor saw any thing to
Night.</P>
<P>Tuesday <HI>September</HI> 1. 1670. Close hasey Wea∣ther,
the Wind at North, a small gale, so as I could
not Sail this day; we tried for Fish, but caught
none, the Water is so cold, I was on the Land,
when I was at the farthest, twenty five miles
West-north-west from the Harbour-mouth, and
all things as I saw I have mentioned, excepting
some small Creatures like Efts, which run in the
Grass; no manner of Snake or venomous Crea∣ture
have I seen in this Country; here are some
Earth-worms, and Caterpillers, and other Buggs,
but few in number: no wild Beast of prey, or
<PB N="56" REF="50"/>
any other thing to annoy the Inhabitants, but
Cold and Hunger: Here lies a large Country,
open to receive any Inhabitants from forein Parts,
and large enough to satisfie the Undertakers:
The Land would produce <HI>European</HI> Grain, if plant∣ed
here, and breed Cattle.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 16. I considering my Men, being
very weak, thought it most fit to go for <HI>Port De∣sier,</HI>
and there to refresh the Men, for I knowing
there I could have what Penguins and Seals I
would have, which are good Provisions; also I do
intend to salt up a quantity of each, to carry to
Sea with me, to lengthen out my Provisions. This
Forenoon I steered from St. <HI>Julian</HI> North-north-east,
and made what Sail I could to get to <HI>Pert
Desier:</HI> This Night it was a small gale, and
veered to the West-south-west; I judge it best to
make my easie Sail in the Night, for fear of run∣ning
up with the Eady Stone-Rocks before day∣light.</P>
<P>Wednesday <HI>September</HI> 21. Fair Weather to day,
the Wind veerable round the Compass. This
Morning I had both the Boats leden with Seals,
and Penguins and Penguin-eggs; ten Men may
kill ten thousand Penguins in less than an hours
time; the Seals and Penguins are numberless:
a Man cannot pass on the Island for them. This
Evening I got on board and landed our lading a∣shore;
fair Weather to Night. The Eggs are
very good Nourishment, and the Fat serves for Oil
to the Lamps.</P>
<P>Thursday <HI>September</HI> 22. Fair Weather, Wind
at West. This day I divided the Eggs amongst
<PB N="57" REF="50"/>
the Men: we skinned the Seals and the Penguins,
and salted the Flesh in bulk on the Rock, and co∣vered
it to keep the Wind from it: good Wea∣ther
and little Wind to Night.</P>
<P>Friday <HI>September</HI> 30. The Wind at North this
Morning; this forenoon it came to the South-east,
and blew hard, and rained. This day I went
up the River about ten miles, and <HI>Don Carolus</HI> with
me, and ten Men to see for People: we lay out all
Night on the South-side, but saw no People; this
Night the people of the Country came to our little
Well, which is up in the Valley, and stole an Iron
Pot, and three suits of Cloaths of the Mens, that
were laid there a drying, with some other Lin∣nen;
but did not meddle with the Beads, which
are hung up on a Pole on the Hills, and they will
not come near it nor meddle with it: The Peo∣ple
of the Country have made in a Valley, the
form of the Ship in Earth and Bushes, and stuck
up pieces of sticks for Masts, and redded the
Bushes all over with red Earth; the Model I ima∣gine
is to record our Ship, for they cannot
have any Records but by imitation: This Fancy
we let alone untouched, only I laid a string or two
of Beads on it and came away: close Weather to
Night. These People must certainly have recei∣ved
some injury in former times, from some Peo∣ple
that have been here in Shipping, otherwise
they would come in sight of us; or else they have
heard of the cruel dealings of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to∣ward
the <HI>Indians,</HI> where they lived near: I have
used all endeavours possibly by fair means to have
Conference with them, but all is in vain.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="51"/>
Tuesday <HI>October</HI> 11. The Wind at West-south∣west,
a stout gale; very cold, Hail and sleety
Snow to day. Our Men are all in good health
and are lusty and fat, those wihch had the Scurvy
are got very well with eating of fresh Meat, and
such green Herbs as they can get on the shore, as
green Pease-leaves and such trade; they mince it,
fry it with Eggs and Seal-oil; and it hath raised
every Man in as good health as they were at our
coming out of <HI>England:</HI> We fare very well, and
have great plenty of good Provisions: Here is
Provision enough of Seals and Penguins, if salt
be plenty, to lade Ships; I can confidently say,
that on the <HI>Island of Penguins</HI> there are more Seals
and Penguins at this present, than three hundred
Tuns of Cask can hold, when dressed and salt∣ed,
besides what are going off and coming on; if
any Men should have occasion for provisions of
Flesh, If they have Salt, here they may furnish
themselves with what quantity shall seem fit for
them, and I can assure them it will last four
Months sweet, if not longer, if care be taken in
bleeding, and dressing, and salting, as I have pre∣scribed
before; the Salt may also be had at Saint
<HI>Julian</HI>'s Salt-pond in Summer-time; also I believe
that Salt may be made at <HI>Port Desier</HI> in the Sum∣mer-time,
for here is some dried Salt on the holes
of the Rocks: Here are several Flats, where Men
may make Pits and let in Salt-water, and so make
Salt, as I have seen in other places.</P>
<P>The Penguin is a Fowl that lives by catching
and eating of Fish, which he dives for, and is very
nimble in the Water; he is as big as a brant-goose,</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="51"/>
and weighs near about eight pounds; they
have no Wings, but flat stumps like Fins: their
Coat is a downy stumped Feather; they are
blackish, grey on the Backs and Heads, and white
about their Necks and down their Bellies: they
are short legged like a Goose, and stand upright
like little Children in white Aprons, in companies
together; they are full-necked, and headed and
beaked like a Crow, only the point of their Bill
turns down a little: they will bite hard, but they
are very tame, and will drive in herds to your
Boats-side like Sheep, and there you may knock
them on the head, all one after another, they will
not make any great hast away; Here are a great
many Sea-Pies, and Ducks, and Ox-Birds, and
Sea-Mews, and Gulls, and white Sea-Pigeons, and
white-breasted Divers, and Dobchicks.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 13. I weighed, and sailed out of <HI>Port
Desier</HI> standing Southward. <HI>Octob.</HI> 16. I was in
Lat. 49<HI>d.</HI> 8<HI>m.</HI> South. <HI>Octob.</HI> 19. I passed by the
Cape, called <HI>Beachy-Head</HI> by our Men, and the
Hill of St. <HI>Ives,</HI> Lat 50 <HI>d.</HI> 10 <HI>m.</HI> The Compass
has variation 16 <HI>d.</HI> 37 <HI>m.</HI> Easterly. The Land
here makes in a Bay, where the River of St. <HI>Cruce</HI>
goes in.</P>
<P><HI>Octob.</HI> 21. We passed by Cape <HI>Fair-weather</HI> in
51 <HI>d.</HI> 30<HI>m.</HI> South-Lat. Here goes on the River
of <HI>Gallegoes. Octob.</HI> 22. We came to <HI>Cape Virgin-Mary,</HI>
at the entrance of the <HI>Streight of Magellan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cape Virgin-Mary,</HI> at the North-entrance, lies
in the Latitude of 52<HI>d.</HI> 26<HI>m.</HI></P>
<P>And in Longitude, from the <HI>Lizard</HI> in <HI>England,</HI>
West, 65<HI>d.</HI> 42 <HI>m.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="52"/>
Meridian distance form the <HI>Lizard</HI> in Leagues,
West 1062. Leagues.</P>
<P>Variation of the Compass here I find to be
Easterly, 17 Degrees.</P>
<P>Here is Anchoring all about this Part of the
<HI>Streights,</HI> in the fair way from <HI>Cape Virgin-Mary,</HI>
till you come into the Narrow. I did not find much
Tide any where hereabout, but in the Narrow,
and there the Tide runs stronger than it does in
the <HI>Hope</HI> a good matter; the floud Tide sets into
the <HI>Streights,</HI> and the Ebb sets out; it keepeth
its course, as on other Coasts: it is six hours
Floud and two hours Ebb; it riseth and falls near
four Fathom perpendicular; it is an high Water
here, on the change day of the Moon at eleven of
the Clock, as far as I could perceive. Many beds
of Rock-weed are driving to and fro here. This
day at two of the Clock I was a-breast of Point
Possession; I steered from thence West-north-west
about two Leagues, and then West and West-south-west:
and South-west and by South, round∣ing
by the North-shore: As I shoaled my sound∣ings
I had 22, and 18, and 16, and 12, and 9
Fathoms, sandy, and sometimes gravelly Ground
and pebble Stones; I sailed, rounding the shore
being unacquainted, and could not tell certainly
where the Narrow lay, for it was shut in one Land
with the other, so as I could not see the opening:
I was open of the Narrow at five a Clock, having
a fine gale at North-north-east. I steered in South-west
and by South into the chops of it, but could
not get past a League into it; the Tide being
bent out and run so strong as I could not stem it▪</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="52"/>
I was in danger of running the Ship against steep
Rocks, which lie in the North-side, the taking a
shear with the Tide, and the Wind was a fresh
gale at North-north-east. There grew long Rock∣weed
on the Rocks; I went and sounded over
them, and had five foot Water on them, and four∣teen
Fathom by the side of them, next the Chan∣nel:
they come trenting from the point of the Nar∣row
of the North-side, a mile off. At six of the
Clock the Wind came to the North; at eight of
the Clock it came to the North-west; it fell very
dark and rained much; I was forced to fall
back again out of the Narrow as well as I could;
the shore I could not see, it was so dark; it fell,
a flat Calm, I finding twenty five Fathom Water,
pebble Stones and oary; I anchored and rode all
Night; little Wind at South-west, and dark.</P>
<P>It is eight Leagues from the first Narrow to the
second, and something better; the Course from
one to the other is West and by South, and East
and by North. This Reach from the first Narrow
to the second is seven Leagues broad, from the
North-shore to the South-shore; it shews like a
little Sea when one comes into it, for we could
not see to the second Narrow, till I had sailed
therein three Leagues or more. At the point
of the second Narrow, on the North-shore;
up to the North-east-ward a mile or two, there is
a Bay on the North-shore, and a white Cliff of
an ordinary height, which is called <HI>Cape St. Gre∣gory:</HI>
In this Bay you may ride in eight Fathom
Water, fine clean sandy Ground, and a good half
mile off the shore; This is a good Road, if the
<PB N="62" REF="53"/>
Wind be between the North-east and the South-west
to the Westward; the Winds are given most
to blow on the Western-quarter. As I sailed tho∣row
the second Narrow, I sounded in the fair
way, and had twenty eight, and thirty Fathom
small stones; The North-shore on this Narrow
makes in a Bay at the East-point, and is white Cliffs
all the way through: This Narrow lies throughout
West-south-west, and East-north-east, and at the
West-end of the Narrow the Land is steep up, in
white Cliffs, and the South part rounds away in a
rore-land: The South-shore rounds away South-east
from this Fore-land, and then it trents away
to the Southward in low Land: The North-shore
of this Narrow or Streight, rounds up to the
Northward in white Cliffs, and falls into shores;
there goes in a Harbour which hath four Fathom
in the Channel, at High-water; it is a flat round
Harbour within, and oary; I called this <HI>Oaz-har∣bour:</HI>
When you are at the West-part of this Nar∣row,
you will see three Islands come open, which
shew to be steep up Cliffs: they lie Triangle-wise
one of another; they are four Leagues distant
from the Narrow, West-south-west; The smallest
and Eastermost Isle is called <HI>St. Bartholomews,</HI> the
biggest and Wester-most is called <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> the
middle-most and souther-most is called <HI>S. George's,</HI>
and by some <HI>Penguins-Isle,</HI> and indeed there are
many Penguins on it. This Evening I got up to
<HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s, and anchored in eight Fathoms and
an half sine black Sand, two miles off the Island.
The East-point bears South and by East of me:
fair Weather all Night, the Wind at South and by
West.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="53"/>
This Morning I went ashore on <HI>Elizabeth-Island,</HI>
and at my landing nineteen of the Countrey-peo∣ple
came off the Hills to me: I had Conference
with them, and exchanged Knives and Beads for
such things as they had: which were Bows and
Arrows, and their Skin-Coats, which are made of
young <HI>Guianacoes</HI> skins; I gave them a Hatchet and
Knives, and Beads and Toys, Trumps, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they
seem'd to be very well-pleased; I shewed them
Gold, which they would have had; I made them
signs, that if they had any, I would give them
Knives and Beads, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for it, or If any where in
the Land: I laid Gold and bright Copper into
the Ground, and made as if I found it there, and
looked to and fro on the Earth as if I looked for
such things; they looked one on another and
spake to each other some words, but I could not
perceive that they understood me, or what I meant;
nor that they knew Gold, or any other Metal:
they would gladly have had every thing they saw;
they tried to break the Boats Iron-grapenel with
stones, and would have carried it away; I let
them alone, and observed their actions and be∣haviour,
which was very brutish: they catched
at every thing they could reach, although I caused
them to sit down, and I put strings of Beads about
their Necks; still they desired more: My Lieu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enant
<HI>Peckett</HI> danced with them hand in hand,
and several of my Men did dance with them, and
made all the shew of Friendship as was possible;
My Lieutenant changed his Coat for one of theirs,
sor they desired it because it was red, which co∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our
they much esteem: I was in great hopes I
<PB N="64" REF="54"/>
might find Gold among them; I gave them all
the courteous respect I could: After two hours
Conference with them, I made signs I would go
and get more things and come again to them;
They went, and would have us to Land again un∣der
a Cliff, which I judge was their Design, to
heave stones into the Boat to sink her, for the
place was very convenient for such a purpose:
They set themselves down on the Grass, and im∣mediately
set fire on the Grass on the side of the
Bank: by what means they got Fire so suddenly
I could not understand. I went and sounded the
Channel between <HI>Elizabeth-Island,</HI> and <HI>St. Bartho∣lomew's-Island,</HI>
and found it a fair Channel to Sail
through, of a mile broad nearest and deep Wa∣ter:
in the middle thirty eight Fathom, and
nine and ten Fathom near the Shore-side, gravel∣ly
Sand.</P>
<P>These People are of a middle stature, both
Men and Women, and well-limbed, and roundish
Faced, and well shaped, and low Fore-headed;
their Noses of a mean size, their Eyes of the mean
and black; they are smooth and even toothed and
close set and very white; small Ears: their Hair
is smooth flag Hair, and very black and harsh on
the fore-part, even and round; and the Locks of
a mean length, both Men and Women alike; they
are full Breasted, they are tawny Olive-coloured,
and redded all over their Bodies with red Earth
and Grease; their Faces dawbed in spots down
their Cheeks with white Clay, and some black
streaks with smut, in no Method; their Arms and
Feet the like: they have small Heads and short
<PB N="65" REF="54"/>
Fingers: they are active in Body, and nimble in
going and running; their Cloathing is pieces of
Skins of Seals, and Guianacoes, and Otters skins
sewed together, and sewed soft; their Garment
is in form of a Carpet, of about five feet square,
or according to the largeness of the Person; this
they wrap about their Bodies, as a <HI>Scottish</HI> Man
doth his <HI>Plading:</HI> they have a Cap of the Skins of
Fowls, with the Feathers on; they have about
their Feet pieces of Skins tied to keep their Feet
from the Ground: they are very hardy People to
endure cold; for they seldom wear this loose Skin
when they are stirring, but are all naked of Body
from Head to Feet, and do not shrink for the Wea∣ther;
for it was very cold when I saw them, and
the Hills all cover'd with Snow: they have no
Hair on their Bodies nor Faces, nor any thing to
cover their privy Parts, excepting some of the
Women, which had a Skin before them; other∣wise
the Men and Women are cloathed alike;
only the Men have Caps and the Women none:
The Women wear Bracelets of Shells about their
Necks, the Men none; the Men are somewhat
larger than the Women in Stature, and more ful∣ler
Fac'd; the Men have a harsh Language, and
speak ratling in the Throat, and gross; the Wo∣men
shiller and lower; they pronounce the word
<HI>Ursah,</HI> but what it means I could not understand▪
nor one word they spake; if they did not like
any thing, they would cry <HI>Ur, Ur,</HI> ratling in
their Throats: their Food is what they can get,
either Fis: or Flesh: they are under no Govern∣ment,
but every Man doth as he thinks fit; for
<PB N="66" REF="55"/>
they had no respect to any one, nor under any O∣bedience
of any in this Company; neither did
they make any shew of Worshipping any thing,
either Sun or Moon, but came directly to us at
our first going on Land, making a noise and e∣very
Man his Bow ready strung, and two Arrows
a Man in their Hands: their Bows are about
an Ell long, and their Arrows are near eighteen
Inches long, and neatly made of Wood, and head∣ed
with Flint-stones, neatly made broad-Arrow-fa∣shion,
well fastned to the Arrow; and the other end
is feathered with two Feathers, and tied on with
the Gut of some Beast, when it is green and moist;
the Bow-string is some twisted Gut. These Peo∣ple
have very large mungrel Dogs, much like the
race of <HI>Spanish</HI> Dogs, and are of several colours;
I did not see any other domestick Creature they
have, neither could I at this time see their Boats;
for they lay at the other end of the Island, next the
Main; they waited on this Island for an opportu∣nity
of fair Weather, to go to the other Islands
for Penguins, there being great numbers of those
Birds on the southermost of the three Islands, and
many other white-breasted Divers.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 30. To Night I anchored in a small
Bay in eleven fathom Water, gravelly Ground,
half a mile off the Shore; no Tide runs here as
to thwart up a Ship; the Water riseth and falls
perpendicular ten Feet. This Bay hath two Ri∣vulets
of fresh Water in it, and good Timber∣trees
of eighteen Inches through, and near forty
Feet long: the Wood is much lik a Beech; here
are wild Currant-trees, and many such like Bushes:
<PB N="67" REF="55"/>
the Woods are very thick and green, and much
old Wood lies on the Ground, so as there is no
travelling into the Woods. I was a-shore looking
to and fro here three hours: I called this <HI>Fresh∣water
Bay;</HI> this is near nine Leagues to the South∣ward
of <HI>Sweepstakes Bay;</HI> Sand-point is a mean
low Point, lies out more than the other Points
of the Shore, and few Trees grow on it.</P>
<P>It is six Leagues from <HI>Fresh-water</HI> Bay, to <HI>Port
Famen</HI> South and North from the one to the point
of the other: that nearest <HI>Port Famen</HI> cannot be
seen, as you come from the Northward, till you
come to bring the Point <HI>S. Anne</HI> up on the North∣west
of you, for the Bay lies up in a little hook
North-west, and the Land on the West-side of the
Bay is low in a Point, and sandy, and some Grass
grows on it, and much drift-Wood lies on it like
a Carpenters-yard: a little within Land from the
Water-side grow brave green Woods, and up in the
Valleys, large Timber-trees, two foot throughout
and some upwards of 40 Feet long: much like our
Beech-timber in <HI>England;</HI> the Leaves of the Trees
are like green Birch-tree leaves, curiously sweet;
the Wood shews in many places as if there were
Plantations; for there are several clear places in
the Woods, and Grass growing like fenc'd Fields
in <HI>England;</HI> the Woods being so even by the sides
of it, and on Point Saint <HI>Anne</HI> as you come
sailing from the Northward, you will see good
Bushes and tall Trees grow on the very point of it:
This Point is rocky on the Shore-side, but no dan∣ger
lies or it; you may be bold on it to get into
<HI>Port Famen</HI> Bay.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="56"/>
Here is good Wooding, and Watering, and
good catching of Fish with the Seyne or Net: I ha∣led
above five hundred large Fishes a-shore at one
hale, much like to a Mullet, all scaly Fishes, here
are many large Smelts or twenty Inches long, and
many Anchovies, and some small made Scates:
Here is great plenty of Fish, so much as we feed
wholly on it, and salt up much of the Mullets
and Anchovies. Here grow many Trees of good
large Timber, forty Inches through: the Leaves
are green and large, much like Bay-tree Leaves in
<HI>England;</HI> the rind is grey on the out-side and
pretty thick rined; this Rind or Bark of these
Trees, if you chew it in your Mouth, is hotter
than Pepper and more quicker; it is of a spicy
smell when it is dry; I cut of the Bark and made
use of it in my Pease, and other Provisions instead
of Spice, and found it very wholesom and good:
wee steeped it in our Water, and drank it, and it
gave the Water a pretty flavor. There grow of
these Trees in the Woods, in many places in the
Streight on both Shores, and on the Coasts on
both sides of <HI>Patagonia,</HI> before your enter them.
This may be the <HI>Winter-bark</HI> of the Shops, which
has an Aromatick pepper-like or spicy tast.</P>
<P><HI>Port Famen</HI> lies in the Lat. of 53 <HI>d.</HI> 35 <HI>m.</HI> South;
and in Longitude West, from the <HI>Lizard,</HI> 68 <HI>d.</HI> 9 <HI>m.</HI>
and Meridian distance 1092. Leagues West, as my
Account is in my Sailing: this Voyage, I give no
credit to the plain Sailing: therefore this Meridian
distance signifies very little as to Navigation.</P>
<P>I travelled in many places, but could not see
any Fruit-trees, or Oak, or Ash, or Hasel, or
<PB N="69" REF="56"/>
any Timber like ours in <HI>England:</HI> Here are but
two sorts or Timber in all these Woods, and one
is the Pepper-rind Tree, which is indifferent
Wood, and the other is the Timber much like
Beech: Here are the best and biggest Trees in all
the <HI>Streights;</HI> here are Trees of two foot and an
half through, and between thirty and forty feet
long; there may be great Planks cut out of them.
I could not see any grains of Metal of Mineral
in any place, and I looked very carefully in Gul∣lies,
and places where Water had guttered. Here
are some Herbs to be plucked up, as we boiled
for Salleting, and green Grass with it, which relish∣ed
pretty well. The Land in the Woods is dry,
and of a gravelly and sandy Soil, and some places
good brown Earth; it is bad travelling in the
Woods for old Trees and Under-woods: the
Woods trent all up on the sides of the Hills; the
Land all about on the North-west and West of
<HI>Port Famen,</HI> trents up to very high Hills, and
the In-land is very high Hills; for we can see the
tops of them all barren and ragged, peeping over
those Mountains next to the Shore-side; much
Snow lies continually on them: the Land on the
South-shore is very high and peaked.</P>
<P>I saw many Ducks and brant-Geese on the
Shore-sides, and in the fresh Waters, together
with some Whales spouting in the main Channel.</P>
<P>I do verily believe that in these Mountains,
there is some Metal either Gold or Copper, for
the Man that went aboard pointed up to the
Mountains, and spake to me when I shewed him
my Ring. These People eat up the Provision
<PB N="70" REF="57"/>
which was carried to them, and greased them∣selves
all over with the Oil, and greased their Skin-Coats
with it: I made signs to them to go
and get some Gold and bring it to me: some of
them went away to their Boats, the rest sat still
on the Grass, talking one to another, and point∣ing
to the Ship. Their Language is much in the
Throat, and not very fluent, but uttered with
good deliberation: I could not perceive but only
the younger were obedient to the elder, and the
Women were in obedience to the Men; for I
took the Mens Coats and put about the Women,
but the Men would not suffer them to keep the
Coats long, and themselves to be naked, but
took the Coats from the Women, and put them
about themselves: I proffer'd them to exchange
one of my Lads for one of theirs, and they laugh∣ed;
but the <HI>Indian</HI> Lad would not go with me,
but hung back: I gave to the Men Knives and
Fish-hooks, and to the Lads Jews-trumps and
Pipes, and to the Women Looking-glasses and
Beads. I did this to gain their loves, and in
hopes to have Trading with them for the future;
they refus'd Brandy.</P>
<P><HI>Cape Froward</HI> is the southermost Land of the
great Continent of <HI>America,</HI> and it is very high
Land on the back-side of it; the Face is steep up,
of a Cliff of Rocks, and it is blackish grey, of
a good height, and deep Water very near it. I
sounded with my Boat close to it, and had forty
Fathom: A Man may lay a Ship close to the face
of the Cape, for there is Water enough: there
is no Ground in the Channel at two hundred Fa∣thoms,
<PB N="71" REF="57"/>
and but little Tide, or any ripling as I
saw, but a fair Channel to sail throughout; of three
Leagues broad from the North-shore to the South∣shore.
It is best for a Ship to keep nearer the
North-shore than the South-shore; for the Winds
are more generally of the Western Quarter.</P>
<P><HI>Cape Froward,</HI> in <HI>Magellan Streights,</HI> lies in the
Latitude of 53 <HI>d.</HI> 52 <HI>m.</HI> South</P>
<P>And in Longitude West, from the <HI>Lizard,</HI> in
<HI>England</HI> 68<HI>d.</HI> 40<HI>m.</HI> West.</P>
<P>And in Meridian distance in Leagues 1099.
and two Miles West.</P>
<P>The Compass hath sixteen degrees of Varia∣tion
Easterly at <HI>Cape Froward.</HI> As to the Fir∣lining
Points I cannot say any thing; I wanted a
Needle.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 4. 1670. I was in <HI>Wood's Bay,</HI> called
so by my Mate's Name. <HI>November</HI> 5. I was a∣brest
of <HI>Cape-Holland;</HI> near which lies <HI>Cape Co∣ventry</HI>
and <HI>Andrew's Bay,</HI> also <HI>Cordes</HI> and <HI>Fostcues
Bay, Cape</HI> and <HI>Port Gallant:</HI> but for a more exact
Situation of the several Promontories, Bays, Ports,
Rivulets, Soundings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I refer the Reader to
the large Draught of the <HI>Magellan Streights,</HI> drawn
by my own Hand on the place.</P>
<P>A-brest of the Bay, two Leagues off, is the Island
which I called <HI>Charles-Island</HI> and <HI>Monmouth-Island;</HI>
more to the West-ward is <HI>James-Island,</HI> and <HI>Ru∣perts-Island,</HI>
and the Lord <HI>Arlingtons-Island,</HI> and
the Earl of <HI>Sandwich's-Island,,</HI> and Secretary <HI>Wren's
Island:</HI> this Reach I called <HI>English Reach;</HI> a
League more to the West-ward of <HI>Fostcues Bay</HI> is
<HI>Cape-Gallant.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="58"/>
The Streight shews now as if there were no
farther passage to the Westward; for the South
Land rounds up so much to the North-Westward,
that it shuts against the North-Land to a Man's
sight. At this distance I saw two large openings
into the South-Land, one opposite to <HI>Charles-I∣sland,</HI>
the other more to the Westward, up of
the round South Bite; there I saw many Whales
spouting, that place I called <HI>Whales-Bay;</HI> I saw
several Brant-geese and Ducks here: I left in the
<HI>Indians</HI> Houses Beads and Knives, in hopes of fur∣ther
Commerce: I saw on the South-side, a Fire
made in the Grass by the Natives.</P>
<P>From the pitch of <HI>Cape-Froward,</HI> to the pitch
of <HI>Cape-Holland,</HI> the Streight lies in the Channel
West and by North, nearest, and is distant full five
Leagues; and from the pitch of <HI>Cape-Holland,</HI> to
the pitch of <HI>Cape-Gallant,</HI> the Streight lies in the
Channel, West and by North, a little Northerly,
and is distant eight Leagues: From the pitch of
<HI>Cape-Gallant,</HI> to a low Point three Leagues to the
Westward, the Streight lies in the Channel North∣west
and by West, a little Northerly: This
Reach is not more than two miles broad, from
the North-shore to the Islands, which I called
<HI>The Royal Isles:</HI> when I was a-brest of the Wester∣most
Island, which I called <HI>Rupert's-Island,</HI> I be∣ing
on the middle of the Channel with the Ship,
shot off one of my Sakers with a shot, and the
shot lodged close to the Islands side. This low
Point, a brest of <HI>Rupert's-Island,</HI> on the North
shore, I called <HI>Point-Passage.</HI> This Evening at six
of the Clock, I was shot past <HI>Point-Passage,</HI> half
<PB N="73" REF="58"/>
a mile to the Westward of it; having a fine Ea∣sterly
gale.</P>
<P>Monday <HI>Noveomber</HI> 7. Cloudy gusts, foggy
Weather, the Wind at West, and sometimes at
North-west: I rode fast all day close aboard the
shore. This Afternoon I went in my Boat over
to the South-side, opposite to <HI>Elizabeth's-Bay,</HI> at
the Point called <HI>Whale-point,</HI> for the many Whales
spouting thereby. I travelled up the Hills two
miles, but could not see any Gold or Metal; the
Land very irregular and Rocky, with mossy kind
of Grass growing on it, and very boggy and rot∣ten;
for I thrust down a Lance of sixteen feet
long, into the Ground with one hand very easily:
Here grow many Juniper Trees, some of a foot
throughout, the Wood not very sweet: Here I saw
many brant-Geese and Ducks, much Snow on the
inland Mountains, so as I could not travel any
farther: I returned down to the Boat again; I
saw where the Natives had been by the evening
of the Grass, but I could not have a sight of any.
Here are many good Muscles on the Rocks of
five Inches long, and good Fish in them, and many
seed Pearls in every Muscle: Here are also large
Limpets and Sea-eggs among the Rocks.</P>
<P>All the Ripling is not worth the taking notice
of, for it is but an hours time on both Tides Ebb
and Floud, when the Tide runs strong; neither
are the Tides any thing prejudicial to the Navi∣gation
of the Streight, but rather advantagious to
help to turn from Road to Road either way: For
I have had a benefit of them in plying from place
to place. The Weather indifferent this After∣noon;
<PB N="74" REF="59"/>
I went a-shore after I had done Sounding
but saw no People nor any Metal; the Woods
very thick, and several Trees of the hot Bark, the
other Trees much like Beech-timber: some Ducks
and brant-Geese seen on the Shore-side.</P>
<P>The Streight in this Reach between <HI>Elizabeth's
Bay</HI> and St. <HI>Jerom's River</HI> is about two Leagues,
broad and high Land on the South-side; which
hath several brave Coves on it like the Wet-dock at
<HI>Deptford,</HI> and safe to lay Ships in them from either
much Wind or any Sea. This Bay I called <HI>Mu∣scle-Bay,</HI>
for in it there are many and great plen∣ty
of good Muscles. The Shore-sides are rocky,
steep too in most places; no Ground in the main
Channel; at an hundred Fathom; also in the Bays
on the South-side it is deep Water, and small
Islands lie in the Bays, and close along the South∣shore
lie small Islands. Here are many Whales,
and I saw many Penguins, and some Seals: The
Shores are woody on both sides, but ragged Tim∣ber
and boggy Ground; the tops of the Hills
bare Rocks and irregular: several streams of
Snow-water run down in the Cliffs of the Hills,
two Leagues to the Westward of <HI>Elizabeth's-Bay.</HI>
On the North-shore the Land is low and woody
near the Water-side, and up of a Valley in this
Low-land: In this Valley there runs a fresh Wa∣ter-River;
I went it with my Boat: It is
but shallow at low Water, hardly Water enough
for my Boat: Here I saw several Arbors of the
<HI>Indians</HI> making, but no People. This River is
a very convenient place to lay Shallops, or
such like small Vessels in it; they may go into
<PB N="75" REF="59"/>
it at high Water, for the Tide riseth here eight
or nine feet: this River I called by the name of
<HI>Batchelor's River.</HI> Before the mouth of this River,
in the <HI>Streights,</HI> there is good anchoring, in nine,
or ten, or twelve Fathom Water, sandy Ground;
a fair birth off the Shore: the Tide runs but or∣dinary,
and the Floud-tide comes from the West∣ward,
and the Tide that comes out of St. <HI>Je∣rom</HI>'s
Channel, makes a ripling with the Tide that
comes along the stream of the <HI>Streight:</HI> I called
this Road that is before <HI>Batchelor's-River, York-Road:</HI>
This is a good place to ride in with We∣sterly
Winds, for here cannot go any great Sea;
neither shall a Man be embayed; that if a Cable
give way, he may have the Streight open to carry
it away; for the Westerly Winds are the greatest
Winds that blow here by the Trees, for they all
stoop to these Winds, and lean to the Easterward,
and the West-side of all the Trees that stand o∣pen,
are made flat with the Winds: the tops of
the Mountains look to the Eastward; the Easter∣ly
Winds seldom blow strong here as to what I
have observed. By the Shore-side which lies open
to the East, the Grass grows down to the Water∣side,
and they are the greener Shores, and the
Trees are streight and tall on the East-side of the
Hills, but on the West-shores, the Grass and
Trees are much weather-beaten, worn away, and
crippled, and the Shore-sides much tewed with the
surge of the Waters.</P>
<P>At <HI>Cape Quad,</HI> the Lands shut one with the o∣ther,
as if there were no farther passage: but as
you make nearer to it, you will see the opening
<PB N="76" REF="60"/>
more and more, as the Streight rounds there more
to the Northward again. <HI>Cape Quad</HI> is on the
North-shore; and it is a steep up Cape, of a rocky
greyish Face, of a good height before one comes
at it: it shews like a great building of a Castle;
for it points off with a Race from the other
Mountains, so much into the Channel of the
Streight, that it makes shutting in against the
South-land, and maketh an Elbow in the Streight:
the Streight is not past four miles broad here,
from shore to shore; and the Land is steep too
on both sides, and rocky; the Mountains high
on both Shores, and craggy barren Rocks: some
Trees and Bushes growing here, and much Snow
on the Mountains on both sides. Opposite to <HI>Cape
Quad</HI> on the South-side, there is a fine large Bay,
which is called <HI>Rider's Bay:</HI> I did not go into it;
if there be Anchoring in it, it is a fair Road for
any Winds: the Water is very deep here in the
Channel, no Ground at one hundred Fathom:
this part of the Streights, from <HI>Point Passage</HI> to
<HI>Cape Quad,</HI> is the most crooked part of all the
Streight; therefore I called this <HI>Crooked-Reach.</HI>
Here are two small Islands in the North-shore, to
the Eastward of <HI>Cape Quad.</HI></P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 14. This Morning I was a-brest of
<HI>Cape-Munday,</HI> so I called it, it being a Cape on
the South-side, and is distant from <HI>Cape de Quad</HI>
about thirteen Leagues: the Streight here is a∣bout
four miles broad, and the North-shore makes
into the Land with great sounds and broken Islands;
the Land on both Shores is high rocky Hills, and
barren, very little Wood or Grass growing on
<PB N="77" REF="60"/>
them: Here at <HI>Cape Munday,</HI> the Streight grows
broader and broader to the Westward, but keeps
all one Course, North-west and by West to <HI>Cape
Upright;</HI> which is a steep upright Cliff on the
South-side, and it is distant from <HI>Cape Munday</HI>
four Leagues. Here the Streight inclines to the
Westward near half-a Point: the Streight lies
from <HI>Cape Munday</HI> West-north-west, half a Point
Northerly right out into the South-Sea, if you
be in the middle of the Channel, or nigh the
North-shore; I find little or no Tide to run here,
or Current: no Ground in the Channel at two
hundred Fathom, a Musket shot off the Shore
on either side. Here run into the South-shore
many Sounds and Coves; I have sailed fair along
by the South-shore all this day; for the North-shore
makes in broken Islands and Sounds: Here
lie all along the South-shore several small Islands,
but no danger, for they are all steep too: the
Streight is a very fair Channel to sail throughout.
This day at Noon, I was a-breast of an Island,
which lies on the North-side of the Streight, I cal∣led
it <HI>Westminster-Island;</HI> there lie a great many
Islands between that and the North-shore, and to
the Eastward and Westward, as also some broken
Ground, and Rocks lie about it: These Islands I
called <HI>The Lawyers,</HI> and this I sland which I called
<HI>Westminster-Island,</HI> is an high rocky Island shewing
like <HI>Westminster-Hall;</HI> the Streight is five Leagues
broad, between <HI>Westminster-Island</HI> and the South-shore;
but between that and the North-shore,
there are many rocky Islands and broken Ground.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="61"/>
The Streight lies from <HI>Cape Munday</HI> to <HI>Cape
Desseada</HI> West-north-west, and East-south-east, half
a point Northerly, and half a point Southerly
nearest, and they are distant from one another
near fifteen Leagues: from <HI>Cape Quad</HI> to <HI>Cape
Desseada,</HI> it is about twenty eight Leagues; and
the Streight lies near North-west, and by West
from <HI>Cape Quad</HI> into the South-Sea, and near
in one Reach, which I called <HI>Long-Reach:</HI>
and some of my Company called it <HI>Long-Lane.</HI>
This part may properly be called the <HI>Streights;</HI>
for it is high Land all the way on both Shores,
and barren Rocks, with Snow on them; and in∣deed
from <HI>Cape Quad</HI> into the South-Sea, I called
this Land <HI>South-Desolation,</HI> it being so desolate
Land to behold.</P>

from the one Sea to the other, according to my
estimation.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="61"/>
The best Land-fall in my Opinion, is to make
the face of <HI>Cape Desseada</HI> for to come out of the
South-Sea to go into the Streight of <HI>Magellan;</HI>
they lie in East and West at the first, till you come
a-brest of <HI>Cape-Pillar;</HI> then the Course is South-east
and by East nearest. Be careful to keep the
South-shore in fair view; for the North-shore is
broken Islands and Sounds, that a Man may mi∣stake
the right Channel or Streight, and steer up
into one of them, as he comes out from the South-Sea,
if he lose sight of the South-shore.</P>
<P>Here lie four small Islands at the North part of
the mouth of the Streight, in the South-Sea; they
lie pretty near together: the Eastermost stands
singly by it self, and is round copling up of a fair
height like an Hay-cock, or Sugar-loaf: the o∣ther
three are flattish; they lie from <HI>Cape-pillar</HI>
North-north-west, by the true Compass 6 Legues
off; they are distant from <HI>Cape-Victory,</HI> near four
Leagues South-west; I called them <HI>The Islands of
Direction;</HI> they are good wishing to fall with the
Mouth of the Streight.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 26. The Land makes in Islands, ly∣ing
near the main Land, is high and large Hills
In-land, which stretch North and South, some
Snow lying on the tops of the highest Hill. At
eight of the Clock I made the Island of <HI>Nuestra
Sennora del Socoro;</HI> in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Tongue it is cal∣led
<HI>The Island of our Lady of Sucore;</HI> I steered with
it North-east and by East; it made rounding up
at the Eastermost end, and lower in the middle
that at either end: it maketh with a ridge run∣ning
from one end to the other, and Trees grow∣ing
<PB N="80" REF="62"/>
on it: the Shore-side is rocky on the South-side
of the Island, and some broken Rocks lie near
the Shore-side, and on the South-east end of the
Island there stand two peaked copling Rocks close
to the Shore, they are white on the top with Fowls
dung. The Island is of a fine heighth, and all
woody on the North-side of it; the Trees grow
down to the Water-side, and fresh Water runs
down in five or six Gullies; the Woods are all
green, and very thick spicy Trees;</P>

<P>I went a-shore with my Boats for fresh Water,
which I had them laden with presently; for here is
fresh Water enough, and very good; I searched
the Shore what I could, I saw on old Hutt or
<PB N="81" REF="62"/>
Arbour of the <HI>Indians</HI> making, and several sticks
that were cut, but all old done. I could not see
any sign of People on the Island now; I believe
the People come rambling to this Island from the
Main in the best season of the Year to get young
Fowls: for I do not see any thing else in the Island
for the sustenance of Mans Life; I could not see
any kind of Mineral or Metal: the Soil is a sandy
black Earth, and some Banks of Rocks: the Island
is irregular, and grown all over with impene∣trable
thick Woods, so as I could not see the in∣ward
part of it: the Woods are ordinary Tim∣ber,
none that I saw was fit to make Planks of;
the nature of the Wood is much like Beech and
Birch, and a sort of heavy Wood good for little but
the fire, it is white: no Fruit or Herbs; very little
Grass, the Woods are so thick; much kind of long
sedgy Grass; no wild Beast to be seen; several
small Birds in the Woods like Sparrows: there
are several Fowls like Kites in the Woods, several
black and white brant-Geese and pied Shags, and
other such Sea-Fowls, as Pinks and Sea-mews:
what else the Island affords I cannot tell. I made
a Fire on the Shore, in hopes to have some an∣swer
of it on the Main, but had not. At Noon
I went aboard, and sent my Boats a-shore again
for more Wood and Water, whilst the Weather
permitted landing.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 30. This Forenoon I was over on
the main side, the Ship lay off, and in. I went a∣shore
with my Boat on an Island which lieth ad∣jacent
to the Main:
There runs a Channel be∣tween
that and the Main, and many Rocks lie
<PB N="82" REF="63"/>
in it, and foul Ground, so as I durst not venture
the Ship in it. This Island shewed as if it had
been the Main, till I went to it with the Boat;
being about four Leagues long from the North-point
to the South-point, and in some places a
League broad. The Island is of a mean height,
and in some places two Leagues broad, and grown
all over with Woods very thick: the Timber is
such like as is on the Isle of <HI>Socoro:</HI> I could
not see any kind of Mineral or Metal in it; the
Shore-side sandy in many places, and rocky in o∣thers;
the Earth on this Island is of a sandy black
soil, but very wet with the continual Rains that
are here. Not finding this noted in my Draughts,
I called it after my own Name <HI>Narbrough's-Island;</HI>
I took possesion of it for his Majesty and his
Heirs: I could not see any People, or any sign of
them here.</P>
<P>South-east from <HI>Narbrough's-Island</HI> on the Main
distant about three Leagues, there runs into the
Land a River or Sound, and some broken ground
lies before it. The Shore-side is rocky, and the
Hills are high in the Land on both sides of it;
this opening lies in East and West, I take it for
that place which in the Draughts is called <HI>Saint
Domingo.</HI> This place lies in the Latitude of forty
four Degrees, fifty Minutes South; and more to
the Southward thereof lie many round coplin
high Islands grown over with Woods: all along
the Coasts as far as I could see, there lie Islands
adjacent to the Main, and they are of a great
height.</P>

This Day all the Bread in the Ship is expend∣ed:

<P><HI>No-Man's Island</HI> lies in the Latitude of forty

<P>This Island is that which the Draughts make to
lie at the South-end of the Island of <HI>Castro,</HI> at
the Mouth of the going in of that Channel, which
is between <HI>Castro</HI> and the Main; the Draughts
are false in laying down of this Coast; for they
do not make any mention of the several Islands
that lie on it, but lay it down all along to be a
streight Coast: the Latitude of most places are
laid down very near as what I have found. Here
are many Islands adjacent on the Coasts more
Southerly, in the Latitude of forty five and an
half, but none are laid down.</P>

<HI>December</HI> 15. <HI>Don Carlos</HI> was put a-shore, and
carried with him a Sword, and a Case of Pistols,
and his best Apparel, and a Bag with his Beads
and Knives; together with Scissars, Looking-glasses,
Combs, Rings, Pipes, Jews-harps, Bells
and Tobacco; all which things he had of me to
give to the Natives. At seven of the Clock <HI>Signior
Carlos</HI> was set a-shore, on the South-side of the
Harbour of <HI>Baldavia</HI> without the Mouth of it a
Mile, in a small sandy Bay, about two miles with∣in
Point <HI>Gallere,</HI> between the Point and the Mouth
of the Harbour. When he was a-shore, he took
his leave of my Lieutenant, and bad him go a∣board
and look out for his Fire in the Night. He
went from the Boat along the Sea-side in the path
toward the Harbour's Mouth: the Men in the
Boat saw him go along for the distance of quar∣ter
of a Mile, till he turned behind a point of
Rocks out of sight. The Shore-side is low and
sandy, and some scattered Rocks lie in it: the
Land riseth trenting to large Hills: the land is
all woody and very thick, that there is tra∣velling
but by the Water-side. My Lieutenant
went a∣shore to the edg of the Woods, and ga∣thered
several green Apples off the Trees: for there
grow Apple-trees on the Shore-side, much like
our <HI>European</HI> Winter-Fruit; the Apples are bigger
than Walnuts with their shells on; whether these
Trees were planted by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> or grow na∣turally
in the Country, I cannot tell.</P>
<P>I do not find any Current or Tide to set on
this Coast, that is any way prejudicial to Naviga∣tion;
neither do I find the Winds to blow Trade:
<PB N="85" REF="64"/>
but they are veerable, and are given to blow
hard on the Western Quarter, and rain much.</P>

<P>the Account I make by my sailing from the
Meridian of the <HI>Lizard,</HI> according to my daily
Account of my Ships way: I do not make any
Account of plain Sailing to be fit for Seamen to
observe; but the best Navigation is by <HI>Mercator,</HI>
sailing according to the Circle of the Globe,
which I ever sailed by, and keep my Account of
Easting and Westing by Longitude, which is the best
and most certain Sailing, to give the true descripti∣on
of the Globe. I have noted down the Meridian
distance I made daily, whereby sush Navigators
and Seamen as know better, may have that to
give them the knowledge of the distances of
Places, according to their Understanding. Most
of our Navigators in this Age sail by the Plain
Chart, and keep their Accounts of the Ships way
accordingly, although they sail near the Poles;
which is the greatest Errour that can be commit∣ted;
for they cannot tell how to find the way
home again, by reason of their mistake; as I
have some in the Ship with me now that are in
the same Errour, for want of Understanding the
<PB N="86" REF="65"/>
true difference of the Meridians, according to
their Miles of Longitude, in the several Lati∣tudes.
I could with all Seamen would give over
sailing by the false plain Card, and sail by <HI>Merca∣tor</HI>'s
Chart, which is according to the truth of
Navigation; But it is an hard matter to convince
any of the old Navigators, from their Method of
sailing by the Plain Chart; shew most of them the
Globe, yet they will walk in their wonted Road.</P>
<P>At eight of the Clock in the Forenoon my
Boat put from me, and rowed to the Shore with.
in point <HI>Gallery,</HI> to the place where <HI>Don Carlos</HI> was
landed: I laid off and on with the Ship before
the Port; the Boat rowed all along the Shore by
the place where <HI>Don Carlos</HI> was landed, and along
the Shore into the Harbour; at the Points on the
South-side of the Harbour stands a small Fort of
seven Guns called S. <HI>James's Fort:</HI> My Boat came
suddenly on it, and before they perceived it to
be a Fort, they were within shot of it. The <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
stood on the Shore; and wasted with a
white Flag, and called to them; My Lieutenant
rowed to them, and asked of them what Coun∣try
they were? they answered, of <HI>Spain:</HI> They
asked my Lieutenant of what Country he was?
He answered, of <HI>England;</HI> they asked him to
come a-shore, whch he did, in hopes to have seen
<HI>Don Carlos</HI> there, for that path that <HI>Don Carlos</HI>
went in when he was landed, led directly to this
Fort by the Sea-side, and it was not a Mile from
the Fort to the place where he was landed, so as
he must go to this Fort, and be upon it before he
was aware of it, unless he knew it before. The
<PB N="87" REF="65"/>
path went all along between the Woods and the
Sea: In the Woods there is no travelling, they
are so thick, and grow on the side of an Hill;
the Fort stands just by the Wood-side on a race of
the Bank, of five yards ascent from the Sea,
with a bank of Earth cast up before the Ord∣nance,
and flight Pallisadoes plac'd in an Half-moon,
four yards distant from the Guns to the
Southward, which Pallisadoes are to keep the
Natives from running violently on the Ord∣nance:
so these <HI>Spaniards</HI> guard themselves with
long Lances against the Natives in the Fort. The
<HI>Spaniards</HI> have Match-lock Musquetoons, but
they are very ordinary ones, and they are as silly
in using them.</P>
<P>At my Lieutenants landing, about twenty <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
and <HI>Indians</HI> came to the Water-side in Arms,
and received him and his Company a-shore, and
carried him some twenty yards from the Water∣side
up the race of the Bank, under a great Tree,
where the Captain of the Fort, and two other <HI>Spa∣nish</HI>
Gentlemen, received him under the shade with
great Courtesie, after the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Ceremony;
they sat them on Chairs and Benches placed about
a Table, under the shade; for the Sun shone
very warm, it being a very fair Day. The <HI>Spa∣nish</HI>
Captain called for Wine, which was brought
to him in a great Silver Bowl; He drank to my
Lieutenant, and bid him welcome a-shore, and
caused five of his Ordnance to be fired, being
glad to see <HI>English</HI> Men in this place, and told
him that this was <HI>Baldavia,</HI> speaking very kindly,
and how welcome they were to him: After every
<PB N="88" REF="66"/>
one had drank, and my Lieutenant had thanked
him for his Entertainment, he desired my Gentle∣men
to sit down, and he discoursed with them,
and asked from whence they came, and what way
they came into this Sea, and what their Captains
Name was, and if there were Wars in <HI>England?</HI>
My Lieutenant answered him to his demands:
My Lieutenant asked him, if they were in peace
with the <HI>Indians?</HI> He answered, that they were
at Wars with them round about, wafting his Hand
round the Harbour, and that they were valiant
People and very barbarous, and fought on Horse∣back,
and did them much spoil; and that two days
before, the <HI>Indians</HI> came out of the Woods and
killed a Captain, as he stood at his Duty by the
side of the Fort, and cut off his Head and carried
it away, sticking on their Lance. He shewed my
Lieutenant the place where the <HI>Indians</HI> came out
of the Woods, and the place where the Man was
killed. They seem to be very fearful of the <HI>In∣dians,</HI>
for they will not stir any way, but they
will have their Piece or their Lance with them.
It is a manifest sign they are much affraid of the
<HI>Indians:</HI> also they have no more ground than the
Fort; neither do they clear any of the Woods on
this side of the Harbour, nor walk at a Musquet∣shot
distance from the Pallisadoes, along the
Woods-side. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> say that the <HI>Indians</HI>
have much Gold, and that their Armour for their
Brest is fine beaten Gold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the Afternoon a Dinner was brought out of
the Fort to the Tent, where they were, and placed
on the Table: The first Course was Soppas, then
<PB N="89" REF="66"/>
Olleos, then Pullets, then fresh Fish, all dressed
with hot Sawce, and very good Diet it was; the
last Course was Sweet-meats: every Course was
served in Silver Dishes, and all the Plates were
Silver, and the Pots and Stew-pots, and all the
Utensils belonging to the dressing of the Provi∣sions
were Silver; the Bason wherein they brought
Water to wash their Hands was in like manner
made of Silver, very large, and the Hilts of the
Soldiers Swords were Silver, but the Hilts of the
Officers Swords were Gold of good value: More∣over,
the Plate at the But-end of the Stock of
their Musquetoons was of the same Metal, and
the Pipe that the Rod runs in was Silver; as also
the tip of the Gun-stick, and their Tobacco-Boxes,
and Snuff-Boxes, and the Staves which
they walk with were headed and ferrelled with
Silver, and ferrelled on the joints with Silver. In∣deed
they are Masters of much Silver and Gold,
and it is but little esteemed among them.
Their boasting was <HI>Plata no vallanada muchoro in
terra.</HI></P>
<P>Four <HI>Spanish</HI> Gentlemen desired to go aboard
with my Lieutenant, and see the Ship, and Pilot
her into the Harbour, if I would come in, which
they did not question but I would, as I under∣stood
afterward by a <HI>Spaniard</HI> that came aboard
to me, who revealed to me their whole Design,
how they intended to surprise the Ship, which I
ever took care to prevent, giving them no oppor∣tunity:
For it hath been a general practice with
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> to betray all forein In∣terest
in these parts; as I had read of their trea∣cherous
<PB N="90" REF="67"/>
dealings with Captain <HI>Hawkins</HI> at Saint
<HI>Juan de Vlloa.</HI></P>
<P>I had much Discourse with the <HI>Spanish</HI> Gentle∣men
this day concerning <HI>Baldavia,</HI> and the Coun∣try
of <HI>Chile:</HI> They tell me they have much Gold
here at <HI>Baldavia,</HI> and that the Natives do much
hinder their getting of it; for they are at cruel
Wars with them, and will not permit them to plant
anything near here about, nor at <HI>Baldavia,</HI> but they
come and destroy it with Fire. And that the Na∣tives
are very cruel and barbarous; if they take
any <HI>Spaniard</HI> they cut off his Head, and carry it
away on their Lances end. These <HI>Spaniards</HI> tell
me that they live here, as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do at <HI>Ma∣mora</HI>
in <HI>Barbary,</HI> having their Enemies round a∣bout
them. These <HI>Spaniards</HI> say, that the <HI>Indi∣ans</HI>
are tall Men, and of a Gigantick stature and
extreamly Valiant, and that they fight on Horse∣back,
eight and ten thousand Men in Arms, and
well disciplin'd. The <HI>Indians</HI> have much Gold;
and their Weapons are long Lances, and Bows,
and Arrows, and Swords and some Musquets,
which they have taken from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and
know how to use them in Service; taking also
Ammunition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> are very popu∣lous
in the Land about <HI>Baldavia,</HI> and at <HI>Orsono,</HI>
and on the Island of <HI>Castro,</HI> and at <HI>Chile,</HI> and
that they have much Gold on these parts about <HI>Or∣sono,</HI>
and <HI>Chilue,</HI> and that they trade with the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI>
and give them Gold.</P>
<P>This Captain said, that they have six great
Ships going yearly from <HI>Lima</HI> to the <HI>Philippine</HI>
Islands, to the Port of <HI>Mannelos,</HI> and that they
<PB N="91" REF="67"/>
have a great Trade with the <HI>Chineses;</HI> and that
these Ships sail from the <HI>Calleo,</HI> that is the Port of
<HI>Lima</HI> in the Month of <HI>January,</HI> and their passage
is but little more than two Months, from <HI>Lima</HI>
to the Port of <HI>Mannelos,</HI> and they sail it within
the Tropicks, and have much Easterly Winds;
and they return back by the Northwards, to gain
the Westerly Winds, which brings them to <HI>Cali∣fornia,</HI>
and to the Port of <HI>Aquapulco,</HI> which lieth
on the West-Coast of <HI>Nova Espana,</HI> and from thence
they come to <HI>Panama,</HI> and then to the Port of
<HI>Lima.</HI> They bring rich Lading, much Silks and
other rich Commodities, and Spices and Callicoes.
The <HI>Mannellos</HI> have a great Trade with the <HI>Japone∣ses</HI>
and <HI>Chineses,</HI> which is very beneficial to them.
The Captain demanded of me whither I was
bound? I answered him, I was bound for <HI>China,</HI>
and that I had rich Lading for that Country; and
that I only touched in at this place, knowing here
were Settlements of the King of <HI>Spains</HI> Subjects,
hoping here to have Wood and fresh Water, and
refreshing for my Men, whereby I might the bet∣ter
proceed on my Voyage. He said, I should
have what the Country would afford, and that
the Captain of the Fort had sent for Provisions
for me, and that I might have Water on the
Shore-sides pointing his Hand to the place which
was near by; the Captain said, it was <HI>Aqua del
oro</HI> (which is <HI>Water of Gold</HI> in <HI>English.</HI>) This
saying caused me to laugh; then he said, it came
running from the Hills where they find Gold, and
that there was Gold in that Rivulet. I asked
him how they get the Gold? He said, they wash
<PB N="92" REF="68"/>
the Earth which is in the Mountains, and find
the Gold in the Bowl or Tray when the Earth is
washed out. And they buy much Gold of the
<HI>Indians,</HI> which they gather in the Gullies of the
Hills, which is washed in there by the Rains, and
snow dissolv'd, which descend from the high Moun∣tains,
which they say are very high and barren
Rocks, thirty Leagues In-land from the Sea-shore.
The Land between those barren Hills and the
Sea-shore, is mighty good Land, and the Country
very fruitful, abounding in many Plains, and
much Cattle that the <HI>Indians</HI> have, as Horses and
Cows, and Goats and Sheep, which they have taken
from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> since they came into this
Country. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> call the high rocky
Mountains the <HI>Andes,</HI> and say that those <HI>Andes</HI>
run all along the Land from <HI>Magellan</HI> Streights in
a row to S. <HI>Martha,</HI> which is in <HI>Terra firma,</HI> not far
from <HI>Cartagean.</HI></P>
<P>The most Gold in all the Land of <HI>America</HI> is
in <HI>Chile,</HI> as what is known at this time. But I
find the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have but little knowledge of
the Land all along to the Southward, from <HI>Balda∣via</HI>
to the Streights Mouth, as far as I can under∣stand
by them, excepting at the Island of <HI>Castro:</HI>
There they have a Settlement, and on the Main
against <HI>Castro</HI> at a place called <HI>Orsono:</HI> At these
two places they have good store of Gold, and
there are many <HI>Indians:</HI> but farther Southerly
than <HI>Castro,</HI> they know nothing of the Country,
or of the Sea-Coast. <HI>Castro</HI> lieth in the Latitude
of 43 <HI>d.</HI> 30 <HI>m.</HI> the South end of the Island,
and the North end lies in the Latitude of 41<HI>d.</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="68"/>
40<HI>m.</HI> It is a fine Island, and near the Main, there
grows good Wheat on it. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> are but
few in number there, but there are many <HI>Indians,</HI>
and those too valiant and of a large stature;
but not Giants as I understand: These <HI>Indians</HI>
have Wars with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and will not suf∣fer
them to search the Country for Wealth.</P>
<P>A Ship brought from <HI>Lima</HI> Provisions for the
City of <HI>Baldavia</HI> and the Forts, and Cloaths, and
Ammunition, and Wines, and Tobacco, and Su∣gar;
and she lades away from <HI>Baldavia</HI> Gold and
Bezoar Stone, and red Wool, &amp;c. and <HI>Indian</HI>
Slaves that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> take here in these parts;
they carry them to <HI>Peru,</HI> and make perpetual Slaves
of them there; and the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Peru</HI> they bring
hither, and make Soldiers of them against the
<HI>Chile-Indians,</HI> of which Soldiers there are many
hereabout, whom my Men saw when they were
at the Fort. There were about thirty <HI>Indians</HI>
and <HI>Musteses</HI> Soldiers there, and some sixteen
white Men who were Officers. Moreover, the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> make use of the <HI>Peru-Indians</HI> to Trade
with the <HI>Chile-Indians</HI> for Gold, although they are
at Wars. For they of <HI>Chile</HI> without doubt are de∣sirous
of Trade, whereby they may furnish them∣selves
with Knives, and Scissers, and Combs, &amp;c.
which are wanting among them; as also with
Arms that many times by stealth are sold to them,
although they be prohibited; Traders will be
dealing; so as they can get benefit, they do not
consider the future danger by its means, provided
it miss them at the present.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="69"/>
I asked them how far it was to <HI>Baldavia?</HI> they
answered me, three Leagues, and that the Boats
could go up to it, and that it was situated by the
side of the River and the Plains, and that there
were five great Ordnances in a Fort to command
the City, and that there were one thousand In∣habitants
in the City of all sorts of Men, Women
and Children. I asked him, if there were any
passage by Land from <HI>Baldavia</HI> to the other parts
of <HI>Chile?</HI> they said there was, and they sent eve∣ry
Week, but they went with good Guards to go
secure from the <HI>Indians.</HI> Then I asked them if
they built Shipping here? they said no, but at
<HI>Velperrazeo</HI> they did build great Ships. I asked
them who lived in the Island of <HI>Mocha?</HI> they said
<HI>Indians,</HI> many Men and Women, and that they
were <HI>Poco amigo'</HI> s to them; in <HI>English,</HI> they were
but small Friends to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> There are
many Sheep, Goats, Hogs and Hens, which the
<HI>Indians</HI> will sell for Hatchets, Knives and Beads.
As to the Island of St. <HI>Mary,</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are Ma∣sters
of it, and have a Fort on it with five Guns,
but few <HI>Spaniards</HI> live there: it is plentiful of
Provisions, as Hogs, and Sheep, and Corn, and
Potatoes: and they said there is some Gold, that
the <HI>Indians</HI> have on the Island of <HI>Mocha,</HI> but they
will not part from it. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> did not care for
answering me to such things as I would gladly
have heard of these parts; for I laid the Draught
of all that Coast on the Table before them, and
asked them who lived at this Port, and who lived
at that: at some places they would say, the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
lived there, and at some the <HI>Indians.</HI> but
<PB N="95" REF="69"/>
they did not care to answer my desires, but frame
other Discourses to wave mine. I find that they
are but little acquainted on the Coasts to the
Southward of <HI>Baldavia;</HI> they say they have <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
living on the Island of <HI>Castro,</HI> and that much
Corn grows there, more especially <HI>European</HI>
Wheat; and that on the Main there are <HI>Spaniards</HI>
living at a place called <HI>Orsono,</HI> which is against
<HI>Castro,</HI> and that there they have Gold, and there
are many <HI>Indians</HI> I asked him if Shipping could
go in between <HI>Castro</HI> and the Main? they could
not tell me, or would not; but they said some
Ships went thither, which come from <HI>Lima</HI> with
Furniture for the People.</P>
<P>The Anchoring at the Island of <HI>Mocha</HI> is on the
North-north-east part of it, in a sandy Bay in
eight Fathom Water near the Shore; a North-east
Wind is the worst Wind for the Road: on the
South-side of <HI>Mocha</HI> there lies a ledg of Rocks,
and some broken Rocks on that part of the Island,
scattered from the Shore.</P>
<P>The Anchoring at the Island of St. <HI>Mary</HI> is on
the North-side in a fine sandy Bay, in eight or
nine Fathom Water, a fine Birth from the Shore;
the North-north-west Wind is the worst Wind for
that Road. There is Wood and fresh Water on
both the Islands, as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> report. The
Tides are but mean on the Coast, and the Flood
comes from the Southward, and rise about eight
or nine feet Water.</P>
<P>The Island of <HI>Mocha</HI> lies in the Lat. of 38 <HI>d.</HI>
30 <HI>m.</HI> South.</P>
<P>The Island of St. <HI>Mary</HI> lies in the Lat. of 37 <HI>d.</HI>
14 <HI>m.</HI> South,
<PB N="96" REF="70"/>
They have Apples, and Plums, and Pears and
Olives, Apricocks, Peaches, Quinces, Oranges,
Lemmons, and many other Fruits: There are
also Musk-Melons, and water-Melons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> These
<HI>Spaniards</HI> report it to be the finest Country in the
whole World, and that the people live with the
greatest Luxury of any on the Earth; they enjoy
their Health with so much delight, and have so
much Wealth and Felicity, that they compare the
Land to <HI>Paradise,</HI> abounding above other Coun∣tries
with all Delights for Mankind.</P>
<P>I saw a good Testimony of the healthiness of
the Country; for these four Men who are on
Board, are as well-complexioned Men as ever I
saw in my days; and the People a-shore, both
Men and Women of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are well-com∣plexioned
People, of a ruddy colour, and seem to
be mighty healthy. Some of the Men are very
corpulent, and look as if they came from a
very plentiful Country, where there is great
store of Provisions, and abundance of Gold and
Silver.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 17. 1670. There went a-shore in
the Boat eighteen of my best Men I had in the
Ship, and Men of good Observation to inspe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
into matters of this Concern, which I had ac∣quainted
them with; as touching the manner of
the Harbour, and the Fortifications the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
have, and the disposition of the People; and
that it was my whole desire to have Confer∣ence
with the Natives of the Country that are
at Wars with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> if by any mens pos∣sible
it may be obtained; for it is my whole de∣sire</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="70"/>
to lay the Foundation of a Trade there for the
<HI>English</HI> Nation for the future; for I see plainly this
Country is lost for want of the true knowledg of it</P>
<P>My Men in the Boat observed the Harbour
and the Fortifications, and took good notice of
the people. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> bought several things
of my Boats Crew: and paid for what things they
bought in good Pillar pieces of Eight; they would
not part from any Gold, although my Men were
desirous to have some rather than Silver for their
Goods: neither would they part from any Bread in
payment, pretending that they should have Bread
to morrow from <HI>Baldavia.</HI> The things which
they bought of my Men at this time, were two
Fowling-pieces, which cost in <HI>England</HI> about twen∣ty
shillings a piece, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> gave six∣teen
pieces of Eight apiece for them; and Cases
of Knives of three shillings the piece in <HI>England,</HI> the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> gave five pieces of Eight for them: and
for single ten-penny Wires, they gave a piece
of Eight a piece for them; and for ordina∣ry
Leather-gloves, of ten pence the pair, they
gave a piece of Eight a pair; for Broad-Cloath-Coats
of the Seamens, which cost sixteen shil∣lings
in <HI>England,</HI> they gave nine pieces of
Eight for a Coat: They were very desirous
to buy Cloaks, and pieces of Bays-cloath. The
Men were very gallant in Apparel in their Plush-coats,
and under-Garments of Silk and Silver
wrought together, and good Linnen, and good
<HI>Flanders</HI> Laces, and broad about the Crown of
of their Hats, in fashion of an Hat-band, and a
great Silk-scarf with Gold Lace on the ends of
<PB N="98" REF="71"/>
it, that was cross over their Shoulders: a short
Cravat of Linnen about their Necks, and a Cane
in their Hand headed with Silver; their Choes,
and Stockings, and Breeches after the <HI>Spanish</HI> fa∣shion.
They were very kind to my Lieutenant
and Men, and treated them very courteously.
They were not permitted to go into the Fort,
but were entertained in a Tent by the Fort.
Four of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Wives would needs go into
the <HI>English</HI> Boat, and sit down on the Benches, to
say that they had been in a Boat which came from
<HI>Europe.</HI> These were very proper white Women
born in the Kingdom of <HI>Peru</HI> of <HI>Spanish</HI> Parents:
they never had been in <HI>Europe.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI>
have some <HI>Indian</HI> Women to their Wives: the
Women were all well Apparelled in Silks afrer the
<HI>Spanish</HI> fashion, and about their Necks great Gold
Chains, and Pendants at their Ears of Saphir
Stones, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Captain of St. <HI>Jago's Fort</HI> presented my
Lieutenant with a Silver Tobacco-box, and a Sil∣ver-headed
Cane, and a Plume of Ostriches Fea∣thers,
which he wore on his Hat at the same time:
the Feather of the Plume is but small, nothing so
good as the <HI>Barbary</HI>-Feather: this Plume was of
red, and white, and blew Feathers died in the
Country. I saw another Plume which a <HI>Spanish</HI>
Gentleman gave to Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> which was black
and large, and a very fair one, made of the Ostri∣ches
Feather of the Country. There are many
Ostriches in the plain Lands, and <HI>Guianacots,</HI>
which are the Beasts that bear the red woou
whereof Hats are made in <HI>England.</HI> There is much
<PB N="99" REF="71"/>
of this Wooll in the Kingdom of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Chile.</HI></P>
<P>My People could not by any means come to
Converse with the Natives who are at Wars with
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and have the Gold, without viola∣ting
the <HI>Spaniard</HI>'s Power: for on the Shore with∣in
the Harbour, the <HI>Indians</HI> made a Fire by the
Woods side, and hung out a white Flag on a long
Pole, and kept wafting of it a long time. My
Lieutenant would have gone in his Boat to them,
but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would not permit him, and said
that they were their own People who lived there.</P>
<P>My Seamen which came aboard in my Boat,
came to me, and told me, that the Lieutenant had
been at Fort St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and had deliver'd my Mes∣sage
there to the Captain, but he had no Order
for my fetching of Water, and that he wished my
Lieutenant to go to Fort St. <HI>Peter;</HI> which he did,
and a Frier and two <HI>Spaniards</HI> went over with him
in the Boat, the Flag of Truce flying in the Boat,
and the Trumpeter sounding, according to my
Order, all the time till they landed at the Fort.
At their Landing, the Lieutenant was received
very courteously by several <HI>Spanish</HI> Gentlemen,
and desired to walk up to the Governour; which
my Lieeutenant did to a Tent where the Go∣vernour
was; the Governour received the
Lieutenant very kindly, and desired him to sit
down. My Lieutenant presented my respects to
the Governour, and delivered to him the Cheese
and Butter, togerher with the Spice, Glasses and
Tobacco-pipes, which I sent to him, and acquaint∣ed
him, that I sent him to desire to know if he
would be pleased to permit my Boat to Water
<PB N="100" REF="72"/>
to day, for my Boats lay ready, and had the Cask
in them, and I waited his Answer. The Gover∣nour
caused my Lieutenant and Mr. <HI>Fortescue</HI> to
sit down, and drank to them in a Silver Bowl
with <HI>Chile</HI> Wine? He gave no Answer to the
Lieutenant at present, but sent an Officer and
Soldiers and seized on my Boat; My Lieute∣nant
desired to know what the meaning was that
possession was taken of the Boat? The Gover∣nour
answered, he had Order from <HI>Don Pedro
de Montaies,</HI> Captain General of <HI>Chile,</HI> to keep
them till the Ship was brought into the Har∣bour
under the command of the Castle, and he
was sorry he had no more Officers of the Ships
in possestsion.</P>

<P>I examined my Seamen which came in my
Boat from the Lieutenant, and they related to me
the whole matter, and they believed that the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
had a design to betray the Ship, but they
could not agree among themselves: I talked with
the two <HI>Indians</HI> that came aboard, they could
speak the <HI>Spanish</HI> Tongue indifferently well; they
told me that I was a Friend to the <HI>Indians</HI> of the
Mountains, and that I was not a <HI>Spaniard:</HI> they
<PB N="102" REF="73"/>
would needs know of me where my Country is,
and if I would come again; I made them an∣swer,
that my Country is a little way off, on the
other side of the Sea, and that I would come again,
and bring Knives, Hatchets, Beads, Glasses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and live in the Country with them, and that they
should see my Country; and that my King would
give them many things, and they should live with
us; and that my King is the greatest King in the
World, and Commands all other Kings, and that
our Names are <HI>English;</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> laughed and
seemed to be very glad: I bad them acquaint the
<HI>Indians</HI> of the Mountains, or In-lands, that I came
to speak with them, and that I was their Friend,
and would give them many Hatchets, and Knives,
and Swords, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> if they would come to me, and
that I came purposely to speak with them; and
that my <HI>Master</HI> the <HI>Great King</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> hath
sent them many things, and would willingly
see them.</P>
<P>After these People had heard all that I said to
them, they sat for a time mute, and considering
of the Kindnesses they received from me and my
Company, and that they must go a-shore again
under the Command of the cruel <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they
weeped extreamly, and uttered these words,
<HI>Numbra Spanalos muccho Deablo,</HI> &amp;c. In <HI>English</HI> it
is, <HI>The</HI> Spanish <HI>men are much Devils,</HI> &amp;c. I verily
believe that these poor innocent Creatures speak
truth, for they are great Devils in abusing these
poor Souls so unmercifully as they do. In sight
of my Men the <HI>Spaniards</HI> with a great Staff would
strike an <HI>Indian</HI> on the Head as he talked with
<PB N="103" REF="73"/>
him, and beat him all along, for no cause at all;
but this they do to shew their Greatness and Im∣periousness.
The best Name the <HI>Spaniards</HI> can
afford to call an <HI>Indian</HI> by, is Dog, and Devil, and
such like Names.</P>
<P>These <HI>Indians</HI> say, that there is much Gold in
the Land, and that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have much <HI>Oro;</HI>
I gave to each of these <HI>Indians</HI> a Knife, and a small
Looking-glass, and some Beads: they were very
thankful, and I put them in mind again to speak
to the <HI>Indians</HI> of the In-land, that I would give
them Knives and Glasses if they would come to
me. I was in great hopes all this time, that I
should have the opportunity to speak with my
Golden Friends, by the means of these People;
for they seemed to be glad of the Message, or of
the things which I gave them to do it.</P>
<P>These People are of a middle stature, strongly
set and well-fleshed; they are tawny coloured,
and have long black flaggy Hair; their Features
tolerable, of a somewhat melancholy Coun∣tenance;
they are very active in Body, and
hardy in enduring of Weather or Diet: They
wear small Caps on their Heads like to Moun∣teers,
and their Garment is a long Mantle; but
most of their Garments are a square piece of Wol∣len
Cloth like a Carpet, of their own weaving
of the Wool of Guianacoes: they cut an hole
in the middle of this Carpet through which they
put their Head, and it hangs upon their Shoul∣ders,
and covers their whole Bodies like a Cloak,
when it is buttoned down before. Some have
these Cloaks so long as it reacheth down to their

middle Leg, and some to the Knee; some wear
half-Stockings on their Legs, but no Shoes nor

<P><PB N="105" REF="74"/>
<HI>December</HI> 18. 1670. This Evening I took the
Suns Amplitude with my Compass, and I had a
good Observation. I find the variation of the
Compass to be eight Degrees ten Minutes Ea∣sterly.</P>
<P>I do much reason with my self as to the Va∣riation,
that it differs so much in the same Lati∣tude,
between the East and West-side of the Land
of <HI>America;</HI> for on the East-side as I sailed in the
Latitude of forty Degrees, I found the Compass
to have twenty Degrees variation Easterly, by
several good Observations, which I took with the
same Instrument as I now do use, which is a large
<HI>Azimuth</HI> Compass; and here I find but eight De∣grees
and ten Minutes variation; and it is but
eight Degrees of Longitude more Westerly in the
same Parallel, differing between these Observa∣tions,
and the difference of Variation.</P>
<P>I find the Land to be but one hundred and
twenty five Leagues broad, from the East-side to
the West-side, in the Latitude of forty Degrees
South of the Equinoctial; certainly the attractive
quality of the Magnet, must be very powerful in
the Eastern part of the Land, more than in the
Western, which causeth the difference: yet I ad∣mire,
being on both sides of the Land, the Com∣pass
should always have the same variation
Easterly. I was of the Opinion that the va∣riation
would have been Westerly on the West-side,
it being Easterly on the East-side: but I
find the contrary by experience; therefore I
believe that the attractive quality is not much in
this part of <HI>America,</HI> but in some other part more
<PB N="106" REF="75"/>
to the Eastward than I was; for if the attractive
quality had been in this Land, and I sailing on both
sides of it, the variation must have been Easterly
on the one side, and Westerly on the other.
This Discourse I leave to a better Understanding;
for I am not as yet satisfied what occasioneth the
variation and the great difference of it, although I
have been on several Voyages, and have made
great benefit of the Understanding of the va∣riation
of the Compass, in directing of the true
Course, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the Port of <HI>Baldavia</HI> there are three fair
Rivers, which come out of the Country, and
empty themselves into the Port with a brisk stream
of fresh Water, which causeth the stream always
to set out of the Harbour, and the Waters to be
fresh just within the Harbours-mouth: one Ri∣ver
runs up into the South-east part of the Har∣bour
into the Country; another River runs into
the Country to the Eastward, on the back-side of
St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Fort: the third River runs into the
Country, about the North-point of the Harbours-mouth,
between the point and the North-end of
St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Island: it runs up in the North-East∣ward,
and nine or ten Mills stand upon the River
from the Harbours-mouth. The City of <HI>Balda∣via</HI>
is situated on the Bank of the River, as the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
tell me.</P>
<P>I judge this City of <HI>Baldavia</HI> is but a small
place, and kept only as a Garrison, and a place
for Trade with the <HI>Indians</HI> for Gold, Bezoar∣stones,
Guianacoes-Wooll, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI>
that were aboard, and the <HI>Indians</HI> said, that there
<PB N="107" REF="75"/>
were but five great Guns in it, and three hundred
Men. I know that they speak of the most of
every thing in the matters as concerning their
strength and number of Men.</P>
<P>I believe that these Rivers may run into the
Country a long way, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to have
but little knowledge in the inward parts of this
Country: for the <HI>Indians</HI> will not suffer the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> to search into the In-lands. I believe
also that these Rivers are not Navigable for Ship∣ping;
for the Bark which was there would cer∣tainly
have gone up the River to the city of <HI>Bal∣davia,</HI>
and delivered her Goods there, and not
troubled themselves to carry the goods up in Boats,
and small flat-bottomed Barges, which they have
there for the purpose: The Barges are built much
like our West-Country Barges, and smaller by
much. These Boats or Barges will carry about
ten or twelve Tuns: they steer with a Rudder,
and have one Mast and Sail, as our Barges have;
the Sail is made of Cotton-cloth, and the Ropes
are made of the rind of <HI>Mangrove Trees;</HI> and in∣stead
of Anchors, they have wooden Crab-claws
or Kellocks. Anchors of Iron and Grapnels are
scarce in these Countries: Ropes and Cables of
Hemp are also scarce there, and good Fir-masts
much wanted in all these Countries for their
Ships. The Masts for their Ships are made of
white Cedar, and such like Wood; they are very
heavy and short-grained, and will break short. There
are not any Fir-trees growing in all the Land:
Good Workmen for the building of Ships are al∣so
much wanted here, and Seamen.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="76"/>
The smaller Boats which they have here are
Canoas, being cut out of the Body of a large
Tree, and shaped somewhat like a Shallop at the
ends: some are thirty feet long, and built one
strake of Board upon them, to raise them higher
on their sides; they will carry near twenty Men
a piece: some are rowed with Oars, and some
are less, and rowed with Paddles: those which
are walt, have a great Beam lashed fast along each
side without Board, which keeps them from over-setting.
These Boats are very ill built, for I saw
not any one of them fit to row in any Sea-gate,
or for any Service, or to carry any Person of Qua∣lity
in. The <HI>Indians</HI> are the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Slaves to
row them to and fro, and to do all manner of
labour; for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> will not lay their Hands
to any thing in that nature, accounting it beneath
them to foul their Fingers with Work; for they
scorn to be Servants one to another, let the one be
never so Potent, and the other not worth the Rags
which he weareth: yet he scorns to be a Servant
to him, and live in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>The Land about the Harbour of <HI>Baldavia</HI> is of
a good height, and in Land it riseth in large
Hills: it is low by the Water-side, and the Shore
is sandy in some Bays, and broken shatty bits of
glittering Rocks lilke Gold, lie shatter'd along by
the Shore-side. All the whole Country is over∣grown
with green Woods, as what I could see of it,
and by the Rivers sides: there is no travelling in
the Woods, they are so thick with Under-brush,
old rotten Trees, and Leaves, and such Trash.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="76"/>
The Harbour is near a Mile and an half broad,
and the Guns cannot command from one side to
the other: St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Fort is near two Miles from
the Harbours mouth; any Ship may come in and
beat them from their Guns, in St. <HI>Jago</HI> Fort, and
in St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s Sconce, which are on the South∣west
side of the Harbour. After you are in, Saint
<HI>Peter</HI>'s Fort can do very little or no hurt at all to
your Ship, excepting it be accidental dropping
shot. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have no Plantation on this
South-west side, they only keep the Forts for
possession, that no forein Ship may come and
have the Port free to ride in, and Trade with
the Natives. The Harbour is like a Sound,
after one is within the Mouth of it toward the
South part.</P>
<P>Here grow many good Canes on the Shore-side,
such as are brought from the <HI>East-Indies,</HI>
which are called <HI>Bamboas;</HI> these are very stiff
Sticks, firm and heavy; they grow among the
Trees on the sides of the Woods like Vines, and
wind about the Trees: some are above twenty
feet long, and taper from the root to the top, like
an Angling-Rod.</P>
<P>All Commodities which come from <HI>Europe</HI> are
very dear here, and scarce, for they have none
brought to them, but by the way of <HI>Panama,</HI> and
by the River of <HI>Plata,</HI> which pass through several
Merchants hands before they come into these
parts, and the transporting of them from place to
place, is very chargeable. Many also are but of
little esteem, here being such plenty of them:
<HI>French</HI> Hollands, Silks, <HI>Flanders-</HI> Laces, Silk-stockings,
<PB N="110" REF="77"/>
Ribbaning, <HI>French</HI> Linnen, Looking-glasses,
and such like Commodities were much
enquired for here, and would have sold at great
Rates.</P>
<P>Gun-powder for Fowling-pieces, is worth a
piece of Eight <HI>per</HI> pound: and Bird-shot is worth
two Ryals of Plate a pound, and a Ryal and an
half a pound. All Commodities of <HI>European</HI>
Workmanship are of great worth here, as I under∣stand;
and believe that more Northerly on the
Coast of <HI>Chile</HI> about <HI>Vale Parazo,</HI> and <HI>Coquinto,</HI>
and <HI>Areca,</HI> where there are more Inhabitants,
Commodities would bear a much greater price
than what I mention, and there would vent grea∣ter
quantities: for Silver is more plentiful by
much in these parts than at <HI>Baldavia,</HI> they be∣ing
nearer the Mines of the <HI>Potosea;</HI> for the
Silver of <HI>Potosea</HI> comes down to the Port of
<HI>Areca,</HI> and from thence it is carried to <HI>Lima</HI> by
Sea.</P>
<P>I am of Opinion that the most advantageous
Trade in the World, might be made in these parts,
if it were but follow'd, and that leave were grant∣ed
by the King of <HI>Spain</HI> for the <HI>English</HI> to Trade
freely in all their Ports and Coasts: for the Peo∣ple
which inhabit there are very desirous of a
Trade: but the Governours durst not permit it
without Orders, unless such Ships of force were
to go thither and Trade <HI>per</HI> force, and not take
notice of the Governours; which might be easily
performed by four Ships of twenty and thirty
pieces of Ordnance a Ship; and I believe that
the Natives in the Southern parts of <HI>Chile,</HI> about
<PB N="111" REF="77"/>
<HI>Castro,</HI> and <HI>Orsono,</HI> and at <HI>Baldavia,</HI> would be
brought to a rich Trade of Gold, when once they
grew to be acquainted with those that should be
employed on the design, and they did but use
them civilly at the first, and gain their loves;
which may be easily done by giving them Knives,
Scissars, Glasses, Beads, Combs, Hatchets, and
the like Commodities, and treat them kindly.
For what I understand by the <HI>Indians,</HI> who were
aboard of me, they are Masters of the Golden
part of the Country.</P>
<P>My intent being, if Weather permit me, to
sail all along the Coast from <HI>Baldavia</HI> to the
Southward, till I come to the Streights-Mouth at
<HI>Cape Desiade.</HI> I came in great hopes to meet with
the <HI>Indians</HI> in some part of the Coasts, and to
Trade with them for Gold, and to find good Har∣bours.
I resolve also to see in at the Islands of
<HI>Castro</HI> and <HI>Orsono,</HI> and try what I can find among
those <HI>Spaniards</HI> who are settled there, and whe∣ther
they live accordingly as the <HI>Spaniard</HI> in∣formed
me here.</P>

<P>All these four were very healthy sound Men,
and of good Presence and Spirit; which gives me
great hopes that they will live to give an Account
of that Country, and of their Travels.</P>
<P><HI>Cape-Gallery,</HI> which is the outermost Point on
the South-side of the Harbour of <HI>Baldavia,</HI> lieth
in the Latitude of thirty nine Degrees, fifty seven
Minutes, South of Equinoctial; as also in Lon∣gitude
to the Westward of the Meridian of the
<HI>Lizard</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> seventy Degrees, twenty Mi∣nutes,
according to my Account; and in Meri∣dian
distance, one thousand one hundred and

to my reckoning.</P>
<P>Thursday <HI>December</HI> 22. This Morning it
prov'd very fair Weather; at Day-light the Wind
was at South-west, a fresh gale; the Sea indifferent
smooth: I plied to the Windward along the
Coasts, and was about three Leagues off the
Shore, somewhat to the Southward of <HI>Cape-Gal∣lery,</HI>
out of sight of the People of <HI>Bal∣davia;</HI>
for the Cape was shut in with the Land to the North∣ward
of the Harbour. At twelve of the Clock I
<PB N="113" REF="78"/>
had a good Observation of the Sun with my
Quadrant; and I found my self in the Latitude
of 40 degrees 3 minutes South: I was then three
Leagues off the Shore, and could not get ground
at eighty Fathom. I was to the Southward of <HI>Baldivia</HI>
Harbour.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 31. This afternoon it blew hard at
<HI>N. W.</HI> and rained; I steered South-west and by
South, by my Compass, this Afternoon and to
Night. Here are several sorts of Porpus. Fishes
in these Seas, unlike ours in <HI>Europe:</HI> some pied
white and black, and some grey and large ones.
Rainy Weather to Night, and no Observation to
be made of the Shore.</P>
<P><HI>January, Anno. Dom.</HI> 1670-71.</P>
<P>Sunday <HI>January</HI> 1. Raw, cold, cloudy Wea∣ther;
Rain and some Hail, the Wind at <HI>N. W.</HI>
a stout gale, and a great Sea: I was much afraid
that I should lose my Main-mast, it fetched such
way, and broke the spikes that fastned the Fetches
with working. I steered <HI>S. S. W.</HI> to ease the
Ship from rolling what I could. After several
Courses made from Saturday Noon till to day
Noon, I make the true Course to be South 39 <HI>d.</HI>
00<HI>m.</HI> Westerly, and distance, sailed 105 Miles,

<P>Wednesday <HI>January</HI> 4. Indifferent fair Wea∣ther,
the Wind at North-west, and sometimes at
<HI>W. N. W.</HI> a fine gale: I kept on my Course South.
Some Porpus Fishes seen to day, and some Whales
<PB N="114" REF="79"/>
and Sea-Fowl: many little Peterels. This Morn∣ing
I took the Suns Amplitude, and I find the

<P>Friday <HI>January</HI> 6. Hasey, foggy Weather this
Morning, the Wind at <HI>W. S. W.</HI> a stout gale: I
steered in for to make the four Islands, which I
called the <HI>Isles of Direction,</HI> or to make <HI>Cape De∣siade:</HI>
My Course was <HI>E. N. E.</HI> by my Compass,
the Nights being but short, and light; for the
Moon was at the full, so that I could see at some
time clear a League before us.</P>
<P>At four of the Clock this Morning, it being
fair day-light, I caused the Lead to be cast forth,
but could not get ground at eighty Fathom: I
reckon my self about ten Leagues from <HI>Cape De∣siade,</HI>
and on the Latitude of 52<HI>d.</HI> 53<HI>m.</HI> South.
A little past four of the Clock, it cleared up on
the East Horizon: we looked well abroad, and
saw the four Isles, called <HI>The Directions,</HI> which lie
at the Mouth of the Streights <HI>N. N. W.</HI> from <HI>Cape
Desiade,</HI> distance from thence abought eight
Leagues. These Islands made in four <HI>Hommac∣coes</HI>
like Hay-cocks, when I saw them: they bear
<PB N="115" REF="79"/>
<HI>N. E.</HI> of me, distant about four Leagues: they lie
in the Latitude of 52<HI>d.</HI> 42<HI>m.</HI> and at five of the
Clock the Islands bore North of me, distant three
Leagues off; I sounded, but could not get ground
at 70 Fathoms; I saw <HI>Cape Desiade;</HI> it cleared up,
for the Fog was much on the Hills; the <HI>Cape</HI> was
<HI>E. S. E.</HI> of me, distant near eight Leagues: the
tops of the ragged Hills, or rocky Spires were
clouded with the flying Fog, so as I could not see
the Cape sooner; for in clear Weather, the Land
at <HI>Cape-pillar</HI> and <HI>Cape Desiade</HI> may be seen fif∣teen
or sixteen Leagues, it is so high and
ragged.</P>
<P>I steered by <HI>Cape-pillar</HI> East and by South, the
Wind at West-south-west, a fresh gale; a great
humming Sea ran here, which came out of the
South-west; I saw the Sea break upon broken
ground, which lieth at least four Leagues from the
point of <HI>Cape Desiade</HI> West into the Sea, and many
Rocks that were sunk, and prints of Rocks above
Water, which the Sea breaketh terribly: these lie
off <HI>Cape Desiade</HI> about two Leagues, and a
League, and some not half a Mile off, very dan∣gerous.</P>
<P>As I came nearer the Streights-mouth, I raised
the Land on the North-side by <HI>Cape Victory,</HI> and
the broken Islands within the Streights, which I
called <HI>Westminster Isle;</HI> and the <HI>Lodgers Isle:</HI> they
make ragged in Hillocks at the first sight. At
nine of the Clock <HI>Cape-pillar</HI> bore South of
me, being distant about a Mile and an half
from me.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="80"/>
No Tide or Current as I could perceive, set
either in or out of the Streights, so as to preju∣dice
Navigation.</P>
<P>The difference of Longitude, East is 1<HI>d.</HI> 39<HI>m.</HI>
4 tenths: the Latitude by my Account now▪ is but
52<HI>d.</HI> 51<HI>m.</HI> South: but formerly my Account of
the Latitude of this place, was South 52<HI>d.</HI> 58<HI>m.</HI></P>
<P>Meridian distance at 9 of the Clock, from Point
<HI>Gallery,</HI> West 35<HI>leag.</HI> 00 <HI>mil.</HI>2/10.</P>

<P>Meridian distance at 9 of the Clock, from the
<HI>Lizard,</HI> West 1153<HI>leag.</HI> 00<HI>mil.</HI> 2/10.</P>
<P>I find but very little Tide or Current in this
Sea of <HI>Mare del Zur;</HI> for I am but 3 Minutes of
Longitude out of my Account, in sailing between
<HI>Cape-gallery</HI> and <HI>Cape-pillar,</HI> forwards and back∣wards.</P>
<P>At any time if you have a desire to enter the
Streights of <HI>Magellan</HI> at the West-mouth, it will
be safest in my Opinion, to bear in for the Land,
in the Latitude of 52 Degrees, and 50 Minutes.
South, and then you will see the four Isles of
<HI>Direction,</HI> which lie before the Mouth of the
Streights, somewhat toward the North-side; they
lie North-north-west from <HI>Cape-pillar,</HI> near eight
Leagues distant. These Islands may be known,
for there are but four of them, and they be but of
an indifferent height, and but small, and bare ir∣regular
Rocks, and they be near together: the
Eastermost Isle is near a Mile distant from the o∣ther
<PB N="117" REF="80"/>
three, and it is peeked up like a Sugar-loaf:
the Sea breaks much on these Isles with Westerly
Winds, <HI>&amp;c. Cape-pillar</HI> is the steep Point of Rocks
on the South-side of the Streights-mouth, at the
entring into the Streights: <HI>Cape Desiade</HI> is the
Westerly Point, for it falleth off from <HI>Cape-pillar</HI>
near South-west, and they are distant about two
Leagues one from another, which is the Face of
the Lands between these two Capes: for at the
Point of <HI>Cape Desiade,</HI> the Land on the South-side
of the Cape trents off to the South-south-east∣ward,
all high ragged rocky Mountains: what
I saw of it, at the pitch of <HI>Cape Desiade,</HI> there lie
many shatter'd Rocks which are above Water, and
shew like the Ruins of old Houses: and there are
ledges of Rocks that are sunk, which lie near four
Leagues off of the Cape, West; the Sea breaks
much on them, and they are dangerous: they lie
in the Latitude of 53<HI>d.</HI> 10<HI>m.</HI> South, by my rec∣koning;
I called these Rocks <HI>The Judges;</HI> they
are near ten Leagues distant South and by West
from the <HI>Isles of Direction,</HI> so broad is the first
opening of the Streights; for when you can but
once see the Land, to make it, there is no dan∣ger;
but a Stranger that should pass out of the
South-sea, and had not passed the Streights be∣fore,
will find it very difficult to pass the Streights
from the West to the East; for at the first entring
into it out of the South-sea, as we call it, there
are many Openings and Sounds on the North-side,
which seem fairer for a passage than the
Streight it self doth: therefore it is best to keep
the South-side, far aboard all along from <HI>Cape-pil∣lar,</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="81"/>
which is the point at the Entrance: the
Course will be East and by South for a Mile or
two, and then East-south-east, and South-east
and by East: so the Channel lieth to <HI>Cape Quade.</HI></P>
<P>The North-side of the Streights from <HI>Cape Vi∣ctory,</HI>
all along to the Eastward to <HI>Cape Froward,</HI>
is all a ragged, rocky, mountainous, desolate
Country; many high rocky Islands, and small
Rocks, and sucking Rocks lie on the North-side
of the Streights, at coming out of <HI>Mare del Zur,</HI>
fifteen Leagues in distance into the Streights to
the Eastward. There also run great Sounds and
Waters into the North-Land, which shew like a
passage more than the Streights doth. There is
no safety for a Ship to keep the North-shore a∣board
in this part; for here lie so many Islands
and Rocks, so that if the Weather prove foggy
and thick, a Man may mistake the right Chan∣nel,
and steer in among the broken Islands and
Rocks, so far as to endanger his Ship, if the
Wind be Westerly, and it is for the most part of
the Winter there, very thick and foggy.</P>
<P>Here are many Sounds and Coves on the
North-side, between <HI>Cape-Victory</HI> and <HI>Cape Quad:</HI>
but how far they run into the Land, I know not.
I wanted a Sloop, or some other small Vessel, to
discover those Sounds: and many other places in
the Streights, which I would gladly have seen.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 6. In <HI>Tuesday-bay</HI> and <HI>Island-bay,</HI> there
grow thick shrubby Bushes on the lower Land,
which have many Berries like Hurts growing on
them: these Bushes grow in a mossy loose Earth,
which lieth four or five Feet thick on the Rock;
<PB N="119" REF="81"/>
these Bushes will serve for Fuel: there grows also
long sedgy Grass very thick; many Geese and
Ducks do make their Nests and breed in it, and
other Sea-Fowl: here are Ducks, white and pied
brant-Geese, grey Gulls, Sea-Mews, Sea-Divers
and Penguins on the Water; I could not see any
People now, but some have been there; for I saw
where they had made Fires, and an Arbour.
Here are Muscles and Limpets on the Rocks, but
as for other Fishes I saw none. I rowed two Miles
up the Sound, and could have gone farther, but
it rained so much, and blew so hard, as I durst
not be absent from the Ship; the Water is mighty
deep in the Sound. At night I got aboard, my
Seamen were joyful to see me, for they were a∣fraid
that the Ship would have broke loose in the
time of my absence. Much Rain to Night, and
Fogs, the Wind at West-south-west, a short gale
at Night; I rode fast on the smooth Water, ha∣ving
the Point on the North-west of me: Here is
a great deal of fresh Water comes running in
streams down the sides of the bare rocky Moun∣tains
into the salt Water; many Whales spouting
to and fro in these Bays and Sounds, and some Seals
on the Rocks: this part is very desolate, and a
mere Chaos, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>At eight of the Clock this Evening, I anchored
before the place called <HI>Batchelors River,</HI> in nine
Fathom Water, clear sandy Ground, two Cables
length from the shore. Here is very good clear
sandy-ground before the River, and good Ancho∣ring
in six, or seven, or eight, or nine, or ten, or
eleven Fathom: a fine barth of shore, and good Ri∣ding
<PB N="120" REF="82"/>
with Westerly Winds, and Northerly: the
worst Wind is a South-Wind, for it blows right
on in this Reach; but there cannot go much Sea
here; for the Streight in this Reach is but two
Leagues broad. This <HI>Batchelors</HI> River is near five
Leagues to the Eastward of <HI>Cape Quade,</HI> and two
Leagues to the Eastward of St. <HI>Jerom's</HI> Channel:
on the North-side of it, the Tide runs of an in∣different
strength in this place, both Ebb and
Flood; it sets in and out of St. <HI>Jerom's</HI> Channel,
rising and falling about eight or nine Feet per∣pendicular:
here is not above ten Foot Water at
a High-water, at the going in of <HI>Batchelor</HI>'s River.
This River is a good Harbour for Barks and
Sloops, or the like. This River lieth in a Valley,
and a fine Grove of green Trees grows on the West
Point: At the entrance here is very good fresh
Water, and a good place to Wood at. The <HI>In∣dian</HI>
People or Natives frequent this place often;
for here are many Arbours, which are their Houses:
Calm Weather to Night, and Foggy; I rode fast,
the Ship being moored.</P>
<P>Sunday <HI>January</HI> 8. Calm Weather, and a fine
warm Sun-shine; This Morning at Day-light, I
went in my Boat with twenty Men into <HI>Batchelor</HI>'s
River, and rowed four Miles up the Creek, or
River, which was as far as the Boat could go; the
Water being high: the River ends in a small
Creek, coming out of a Lake of fresh Water, in a
Valley amongst the Hills: we made the Boat
fast, and marched all into the Land five or six
Miles, being stop'd from going further, by Hills
rising very steep, and Mountains, and impenetrable
<PB N="121" REF="82"/>
Woods: we made several Fires, but could not see
any sign of them so far in the Land. No Beast
or other Creature to be seen; many small streams
of fresh Water come running from the snowy
Mountains, with great Falls from the steep Rocks:
we looked in many places of the Earth, and in
the streams of Water for Gold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but found
none, nor any other Metal of Mineral: Here
grow on the Bushes many small red Berries, much
like Hurts, very good to eat; the Grass-Land is
very loose and Boggy: the Rocks are a kind of
white Marble; the Trees like those at <HI>Port Fa∣men;</HI>
here are small Pepper-trees. To Night I got
on Board; Calm Weather: I rode fast with the
Ship.</P>
<P>Here ends <HI>Sir John Narbrough</HI>'s Manuscript
Journal, which we shall continue home to <HI>England,</HI>
from the <HI>MS Diary,</HI> taken by Sir <HI>John's</HI> ingeni∣ous
<HI>Lieutenant, Nathaniel Pecket.</HI></P>
<P>Wednesday <HI>January</HI> 11. Fair Weather, Wind va∣riable,
from South-east to South-west. This Morn∣ing
we made the best of our way to get into <HI>Port
Famen</HI> Here we had Fishes from the Shore to Fish
our Main-mast: At twelve a Clock we Anchored
in nine Fathom Waaer. This place afforded what
we wanted, as very good large Trees for Fishes:
good Water, good wild Fowl, good fish, like
Mullets, and large Smelts. here we fitted our
Ships Masts, and Rigging as well as we could;
Careen'd her, and filled our Casks with good
fresh Water, and took as much Wood aboard, as
we thought fit.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="83"/>
<HI>January</HI> 16. Fair Weather, and little Wind,
Westerly. This Morning the Lieutenant was or∣dered
to go up with the Boat in <HI>Segars</HI> River, as
high as he could with convenience, and to see for
<HI>Indians:</HI> He went up about nine Miles, but could
nor get higher with the Boat, by reason of the
Trunk-timber, and shoaliness in the Water. So I
landed, and went up two Miles by Land to see for
<HI>Indians:</HI> but I could not see any, not any thing
worth the Observation. How far the River runs
up, I know not, for I saw not the end of it: so I
returned a-board again.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 29. Fair Weather, and little Wind
at South-west. This Morning the Captain went
over with the Pinnace to the South-shore to see
for <HI>Indians,</HI> and if there were and Harbour for Ship∣ping,
short of <HI>Port Famen.</HI> This day came an <HI>In∣dian</HI>
to the Point of <HI>Port Famen,</HI> and made a Fire;
and I went a-shore to see what he had: but he
had neither Bow, nor Arrow, nor any thing else
to the value of the Farthing: I would have had
him come a-board with me, but he would not; as
far as I understood by the Signs he made to me,
he had been a slave to some other <HI>Indians,</HI> and
had run away from them, and was travelling
home.</P>
<P>Tuesday <HI>January</HI> 31. Fair Weather, Wind va∣riable.
This Evening the Captain came a-board
again, having been over on the South-shore, to
see for an Harbour, but could find none, nor see
any <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>Saturday <HI>February</HI> 4. Fair Weather, Wind at
West by North. This Morning, at four a Clock
<PB N="123" REF="83"/>
we set Sail for <HI>Port Famen,</HI> and at eleven a Clock
we were short of <HI>Fresh-water Bay;</HI> and at six a
Clock in the Evening, we Anchored in twelve
Fathom Water, in a fine sandy Bay, about four
Leagues to the Northward of <HI>Freshwater</HI> Bay.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 5. Fair Weather, but very much Wind,
at South-west, and West-south-west. This Morn∣ing
the Captain sent me to <HI>Freshwater</HI> Bay to see
for <HI>Indians,</HI> but I saw none there, so I returned a∣gain
aboard.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 7. Fair Weather, Wind Northerly.
This Morning the Captain ordered me to take
the Pinnace, and to go along the North-shore, and
between <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Island and the Shore, to see
for <HI>Indians.</HI> In the Afternoon, it blew hard Nor∣therly,
that we could not row a head; so I put
back into a sandy Bay, and went a-shore, and stay∣ed
there all Night; and in this Bay we haled
the same, and got a great many good and large
Smelts; Smelts of twenty Inches long, and eight
Inches about.</P>
<P>Wednesday <HI>February</HI> 8. Fair Weather, Wind
West-south-west. This Morning at four a Clock,
I run down the Streights with the Pinnace, keep∣ing
the Norht-shore a-board, and run berwixt it
and <HI>Elizabeth's</HI> Island, but saw no <HI>Indians:</HI> yet
saw several places, where they had been very
lately, and where they had built their Canowes.
From <HI>Cape Desiade</HI> to <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Island, there is
Wood and fresh Water plenty; but from <HI>Eliza∣beths</HI>
Island, to <HI>Cape Virgin-Mary,</HI> Wood and fresh
Water is very scarce to come by. This Afternoon
at three a Clock, I got a-board again, and at four
<PB N="124" REF="84"/>
a Clock, we came to an Anchor in eight Fathom
Water, black Sand; we rid within a Mile of the
North-shore: St. <HI>Georges,</HI> and St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI>'s
Island were both shut in one, and they bore South∣south-east
of me; and <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Island bore South
and by East; And here we rid with the Ship all
Night.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 9. Fair Weather, Wind Westerly.
This Morning the Captain sent me to see for <HI>Indians,</HI>
but I could see none; yet I fell with a good
Harbour for small Vessels, on the North-side, and
at the South-end of a great deep Bay, thwart of
<HI>Elizabeths</HI> Island; the entrance of this Harbour
is not a Bow-shot from side to side: I sounded
it, and there was twelve foot Water at a low
Water; but within there was three Fathom Wa∣ter,
at low Water: from the entrance of this
Harbour to the upper end of it. is about seven
Miles; Here is in this Harbour great stone of
Geese and Ducks; and a-shore there is great store
of Heath-berries, and Hicts, and small Black∣berries,
good and well-tasted; but I saw no <HI>Indians,</HI>
so I returned a-board again; the Captain
went into another Harbour, a Mile to the South∣ward
of the second Narrow on the North∣shore,
and sounded, and had four Fathom Water in it;
it is very broad within, and there is great store of
Sea-Crabs.</P>
<P>Saturday <HI>February</HI> 11. Fair Weather, Wind va∣riable.
This day the Captain ordered me to go
with the Pinnace, and discover the North-shore,
and if I could with convenience discover some
part of the South; and to go to the first Narrow,
<PB N="125" REF="84"/>
and there to stay for the Ship; so I went through
the second, and landed on the South-side, in a fine
sandy Bay, or Cove, expecting to fall with <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI>
for I saw a many Fires up in the Land; I
went up about five or six Miles, but could see
no <HI>Indians.</HI> Then the Night coming on, I re∣turned
again to the Boat, and there we pitched a
Tent to lie in, and lay all Night; and at High∣water
we set the same thwart a Pond of Water,
and there it stood until Low-water; then we hal∣led
the Pond all over, and haled a-shore about
700 good and large Fish like Mullets. This
Land is very dry, barren Land, and nothing to
be seen in it worth the Observation.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 12. Fair Weather, Wind Northerly.
This Morning I went over to the North-shore,
and there I fell with a fine sandy Bay; I sounded
it, and had 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 Fathom Water a∣bove
half a Mile from the Shore. This Bay is be∣tween
the second Narrow, and <HI>Cape Gregory;</HI> close
under <HI>Cape Gregory;</HI> this Cape is about five or
six Miles to the Eastwards of the second Narrow:
here I landed, the Winds being Northerly, a
fresh gale, and haled the Boat up dry; and went
up into the Country to see for <HI>Indians;</HI> but saw
none, and I returned to the Boat again, where
we pitched our Tent, and lay all Night.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 13. Fair Weather, and a fresh gale of
Wind Westerly. This Morning I run all along
the North-shore from <HI>Cape Gregory,</HI> to the first Nar∣row:
and I was no sooner entred into the first
Narrow, but I saw three Anchors, which lay up
above <HI>High-water Mark,</HI> in a small sandy Cove:
<PB N="126" REF="85"/>
there I landed, and haled up the Boat; and search∣ed
about to see if we could fall with any Guns,
or other Trade. One of the Men found an Iron
Commander for some Ships Poop: one of those
Anchors were twelve Foot long in the Shank,
and the other two were eleven Foot a piece, and
they were all <HI>spanish</HI> Anchors. The Land here is
barren, dry Land, and affords neither Wood, nor
fresh Water; and for the space of five, or six Miles
about, the land is full of Rats; they have Holes
in the Ground like Coney-burroughs: their Food
I suppose to be Limpet, for there is great store
of Limpet-shoals lying close to their Holes: I
saw no <HI>Indians</HI> here, nor any thing worth Obser∣ving.
Night coming on, we here pitched our
Tent, and lay all Night; here are very good
sandy Bays on the North-side, all the way betwixt
the first and second Narrow: for I sounded all
along as I came down in the Boat, and had ten
and twelve Fathom Water, a good Burth off.</P>
<P>Tuesday <HI>February 14.</HI> Close, hasey Weather,
with some Rain, and very much Wind Westerly.
This Morning I saw the Ship coming down the
Streights; and after she was through the Narrow,
they brought her to, and I got a-board; and we
made all the Sail we could, and by Night we got
clear of the Streights into the North-sea; and at
three a Clock <HI>Cape Virgin-Mary</HI> bore North-west ½
a Point Northerly, distance 4 Leagues.</P>
<P>Thursday <HI>February</HI> 23. Fair Weather the Wind
variable, from the North-north-west, to the West-north-west.
This Evening at nine a Clock, we
came to an Anchor in 22 Fathom Water, sandy
<PB N="127" REF="85"/>
Ground on the South-part of <HI>America,</HI> in the Lat.
of 47<HI>d.</HI> 16<HI>m.</HI> South; and then <HI>Cape-Blanco</HI> bore
North-north-west of me, distant about six Leagues.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 24. Fair Weather, and little Wind,
Northerly. This Morning we weighed, to go
to <HI>Port Desire-Bay,</HI> and in the Evening at six
a Clock we Anchored in the Bay, in fourteen Fa∣thom
Water.</P>
<P><HI>February,</HI> 25. Fair Weather, and a Fresh gale
of Wind Easterly. This day the Long boat went
into <HI>Port-Desire</HI> for fresh-Water, but could not fill
above five or six Puncheons; for there was no
more to be had there, and all they brought a∣board
was brackish: Fair Weather, Wind variable.</P>
<P>Sunday <HI>February</HI> 26. Fair Weather, and a fresh
Wind at South-south-west. Thiw Morning we set
Sail from <HI>Port-Desire,</HI> to go for <HI>England;</HI> and at
twelve a Clock, I was in the Latitude of 47 deg.
10<HI>m.</HI> South. And then <HI>Cape-Blanco</HI> bore North∣west
of me, but not by the Compass; for here is
a Point and half variation Easterly: and at four
a Clock <HI>Cape-Blanco</HI> bore West-north-west of me,
by the Compass, distance nine Miles, and then
we had twenty Fathom Water: but when it bears
West-north-west from you, and you are 8 Miles
off, you will have but ten Fathom Water. Here
is very good Sounding al the Coast along, from
this Cape ot <HI>Cape Virgin-Mary,</HI> which lies in 52<HI>d.</HI>
15<HI>m.</HI> South. Within five Leagues off the Main,
you will have 25 and 30 Fathom Water; and 10
Leagues off, you will have 50, and 55 Fathom
Water, it is black oasie Sand.</P>

Wednesday <HI>May</HI> 17. The Weather fair. This
Evening at six a Clock, we saw the Island of Saint
<HI>Mary,</HI> one of the Isles of <HI>Azores,</HI> it bore East-north-east
of me, distant about sixteen Leagues
by Estimation: fair Weather, Wind at South-east.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 19. Fair Weather, Wind Easterly. This
Morning at seven a Clock, the Town of <HI>Puntele∣gada,</HI>
upon the Island of St. <HI>Michaels,</HI> one of the
Isles of <HI>Azores,</HI> bore North of me, distant about
two Miles; and my Longitude difference from
<HI>Cape-Blanco</HI> to this Town is My
Meridian distance from <HI>Cape-Blanco</HI> to this Town
is Leagues, Miles, Tenths, Easting
this Town, lying so far to the Eastward of the
Cape. This day the Captain sent me a-shore to
<HI>Puntelegada,</HI> to enquire News from <HI>England,</HI> whe∣ther
we had War, or Peace with any other Nation,
or not; and I was informed by Mr. <HI>Richard Nu∣cheuson,</HI>
that we had War with none, but the <HI>Ar∣gea</HI>-Men.
So I returned a-board again, and we
made all the Sail we could for <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Tuesday <HI>May</HI> 23. Fair Weather, and much
Wind at North-east; our Provisions being almost
done, and but little Water in the Ship; we bore
up to go for <HI>Angria</HI> at the <HI>Tercesas</HI></P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 24. Close, hasey Weather, and a fresh gale of
Wind at North-east and by North. This Forenoon
we Anchored in <HI>Angria</HI>-Rode, in sixteen Fathom
Water.</P>

Saturday <HI>June</HI> 10. 1671. It was hasey, dirty
Weather, Wind at S. W. This moring I saw
<HI>Scilly,</HI> at seven a Clock; it bore N. E. by N. of
me, distant about 5 Leagues; and at six a Clock
in the Afternoon the <HI>Lizzard</HI> bore North of me,
distant about 3 Leagues. Now, I make my dif∣ference
of Longitude, from Cape <HI>Blanco</HI> to the

<P>IN the year 1642. <HI>Aug.</HI> 14. He set Sail with
two Ships from <HI>Batavia,</HI> to wit, the Yacht
<HI>Heemskirk</HI> and the Fly-boat <HI>Seehane;</HI> and
the 5. of <HI>September</HI> came to an Anchor
at the Island <HI>Mauritius</HI> 20<HI>d.</HI> South Latitude, and
83<HI>d.</HI> 48<HI>m.</HI> Long. They found this Island 50
<HI>Dutch</HI> Miles more Easterly than by their reckon∣ing,
which make 3<HI>d.</HI> 33<HI>m.</HI> of Longitude. The
<PB N="132" REF="88"/>
8. of <HI>October</HI> they departed from thence, and
went nearly South, till the 40, or 41<HI>d.</HI> having
North-west var. 23, 24, and 25<HI>d.</HI> to the 22. of
<HI>October.</HI> From that time they bore away East,
somewhat Southwardly, till the 29. when they
were in South Latitude 45<HI>d.</HI> 47<HI>m.</HI> Longit. 89<HI>d.</HI>

variation was no more than 4<HI>d.</HI> The 22. being
the next day, their Compass would not stand still
as it ought, therefore they guessed there was
here some Mines of Load-stone, for that their
Compass stood not still upon any of the eight
Points. The 24. of <HI>November</HI> in South Latitude
42<HI>d.</HI> 25<HI>m.</HI> and their middle Longitude of 163<HI>d.</HI>
50<HI>m.</HI> they saw Land E. by N. distant from them
10. Miles, which they named <HI>Anthony van Die∣mens
Land.</HI> Here the Compass stood right at
this Land in the Longitude of 163<HI>d.</HI> 50<HI>m.</HI> They
had much stormy bad weather, so they went a∣way
S. by E. along the Coast to 44<HI>d.</HI> of South
Latitude, where the Land runs away E. and after
N. E. and northerly; here in the Longitude
167<HI>d.</HI> 55<HI>m.</HI> and Latitude 43<HI>d.</HI> 10<HI>m.</HI> they
came to Anchor in a Bay, which on the 1. of
<PB N="133" REF="88"/>
<HI>December</HI> they named <HI>Frederick Hendricks Bay:</HI>
They heard as they thought the noise of Men,
but saw none; they saw also two Trees about
two or two and a half Fathom thick, and 60, or
65 Foot high below the Branches; the Bark of
these Trees was cut with Flint, peeled off in form
of Steps, to help the Inhabitants to climb them,
and take the Birds Nests thereon: these Steps
were about 5. Food asunder, so that we must ei∣ther
conclude these People very great, or else
that they have some unknown trick to make use
of the said Steps for climbing these Trees. In
the one Tree the Steps seemed so fresh and green
as if it had not been four days since they were
cut: the noise of men, and the play which they
heard was much like that of a Jews-<HI>Trump,</HI> or
little <HI>Gom,</HI> which was not far off, but they saw
no body. They saw the footing of wild Beasts
having Claws like a <HI>Tyger,</HI> and of other Beasts:
They found also Gum of the Trees, and Gum-Lac
of the Ground. The Ebb and Flood was
here about three Foot. The Trees stood not
thick, nor incumbred with thick bushes or un∣derwood:
they saw likewise in several places the
smoak of fire. Here they did nothing but only
set up a Stake with the Companies mark, and a
Princes Flag thereon; there was here 3<HI>d.</HI> N. E.
variation. <HI>December</HI> 5. S. Lat. 41<HI>d.</HI> 34<HI>m.</HI> Long.

had Land in sight which was very high and hilly,
and which in the Charts is now called <HI>New Zea∣land;</HI>
they went N. Eastwards along the Land as
the Chart shewed it, till they Anchored in a Bay,
in South Latitude 40<HI>d.</HI> 50<HI>m.</HI> Longitude 191 <HI>d.</HI>
41<HI>m.</HI> N. E. variation 9<HI>d.</HI> and that on the 18.
of <HI>December</HI> 1642. These Inhabitants were rough
of voice, thick and gross made, they came not
within a Stones cast on Board of us, and blew
several times on an Instrument which made a noise
like a <HI>Moorish</HI> Trumpet, in answer thereto we
blew ours. Their colour was between Brown
and Yellow; they had black Hair, bound fast and
tight upon the crown of their Head, in the
same manner as the <HI>Japanners</HI> have theirs be∣hind
their Head, and near as long and thick of
Hair, upon which stood a great thick white
Feather: their Clothes were of Mats, others of
Cotton, but their upper parts were naked.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> 19. these Antipodes began to be some∣what
bolder, and more free, so that they indea∣voured
to begin a Truck or Merchandize with
the Yacht, and began to come on Board; the Com∣mander
seeing this began to fear, lest they might
be fallen upon, and sent his Boat or Prow with
seven Men to advertise them that they should not
trust these People too much: they went off from
the Ship, and not having any Arms with them,
were set upon by these Inhabitants, and three or
<PB N="135" REF="89"/>
four of them were killed, and the rest saved
themselves by swimming: this they indeavoured
to revenge, but the water going high they were
hindred; this Bay was by them for this reason
named <HI>Murderers Bay,</HI> as it is marked in the
Charts. From this Bay they went on E. and
found the Land all round about them: It seems
a very good Land, fruitful, and well scituated, but
by reason of the bad Weather and West Wind
they had a great deal of trouble to get out. The
24. of <HI>December</HI> because the Wind would not
well suffer them to go to the Northward, they
not knowing if they should find any Passage to the
North, and the Flood coming out of the S. E.
they concluded to go back again into the Bay,
and there seek a Passage; but the 26. the Wind
better serving, they went away Northerly some∣what
to the West. <HI>January</HI> 4. 1643. in South

N. E. variation 8<HI>d.</HI> 40<HI>m.</HI> they came to the N. W.
cape of this Land, and had hollow Waves out of
the N. E. and therefore doubted not there must
be a great Sea in the N. E. whereupon they were
glad, as having now gotten a Passage. Here lay
an Island which they named <HI>three Kings Island,</HI>
to which they went to refresh themselves, and
being come near they saw upon the Hill thirty
or thirty five Men, being of tall Stature (as well
as might be discerned from far) with Sticks or
Clubs, who called to them with harsh or loud
voices, but they could not understand them;
and those Men when they walked made very wide
paces or steps. In turning about this Island there
<PB N="136" REF="90"/>
appeared very few Men, and they saw little or no
Cultivated Land, but only found a fresh River,
where our People intended to get fresh water,
but by some unlucky accident were prevented;
whereupon it was resolved to go with an Eastern
Course to the Longitude of 220<HI>d.</HI> and then
Northward to the South Latitude of 17<HI>d.</HI> and
from thence Westward to the <HI>Cocos and Horns
Islands,</HI> first discovered by <HI>William Scouten;</HI> and
then if not sooner to recruit, for they had indeed
been upon <HI>Anthony van Diemens Land,</HI> but had
met with nothing, and upon <HI>New Zealand</HI> they
had not so much as once been a-shore.</P>

Island about two or three Miles round, high,
steep and barren in appearance; they would
willingly have come nearer to it, but could not,
because of the S. E. and S. S. E. Wind; they gave
it the name of <HI>Piilstreets Islands,</HI> because of the
multitude of those Fowls: the next day they
saw again two Islands. The 21. of <HI>January</HI> in S.

Island, which was the biggest and not high;
they gave it the name of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and the
other <HI>Middleburgh.</HI> On this <HI>Amsterdam</HI> they got
many Hogs, Hens, and all sorts of Fruits; the
Inhabitants were friendly, had no Weapons, and
appeared to know no evil, excepting that they
take the liberty to Steal: there the Current is not
great, the Ebb runs near N. E. and the Flood S. W.
a S. W. Moon makes high Water, and it flows se∣ven
or eight Foot at least; the Wind is continu∣ally

was a drift, but saved her self off the

not easie to come by. <HI>January</HI> 25. in South La∣titude

Islands they came to the Island <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> as you
see it in the Chart. The People were friendly
and without Arms as the former, but likewise
very thievish: here they got fresh Water and other
refreshment; they went through this Island, and
found the Cocos or Clappus Trees in great plen∣ty,
planted orderly one by another, and Gardens
whose Beds were made square and very hand∣some,
and set with all sorts of Fruit Trees, which
in almost all places were planted in a right Line,
so that it was a pleasure to behold them, on all
sides giving a fragrant and delightful smell. From
this Island <HI>Rotterdam</HI> they departed, and saw
some other Islands which you see in the Chart,
and now designed according to their former re∣solution
to go away North till the 17. degree of

drift Wood, as small Trees, Bamboes and other
filth, from the Land that came out from the Ri∣vers,

many Rivers, and that it must be a good Land.

they got many Coco-Nuts and other things:
The People were wholly black, and what they
heard our People speak they could very perfectly
repeat, which is a certain sign that their Language
is very copious in Words, and difficult to be pro∣nounced,
because they use much the Letter R.

The next day they came before <HI>Moa,</HI> where like∣wise
they got much refreshment; here by reason
of contrary Winds they stayed till the 6. of <HI>May,</HI>

and 100 Bundles of <HI>Pysanghs;</HI> about the be∣ginning

Company was hurt with an Arrow shot by one
of the Inhabitants: whilst this past they were
getting their Ships nearer to the Land, where∣with
this People were so frighted, that of
their own accord they brought aboard him that
had shot the Arrow, for us to do with him
what we pleased, and from that time they
were better to be spoken withal, whether it
were in their Traffick or otherwise, so that our
People took pieces of Iron Hoops and fitted them
into Hafts, and made them somewhat bright and
sharp, and so put them off for Knives. It is pro∣bable

by Captain John Wood.</HEAD>
<P>TO Write a full Relation of all those
Navigators that have attempted to
find a Passage by the N. E. to <HI>China</HI>
and <HI>Japan</HI> will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eedless, since their

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> said Voyage, with the event thereof.</P>
<P>The first that ever Attempted the said Voyage
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sir <HI>Hugh Willoughby</HI> in the year 1553. with
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sail of Ships, and he sail ed to the North
Cape of <HI>Finmarke,</HI> and then into the Lat. of 72.

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>annot be found again, and I am of Opinion
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at it was some Fog Bank that he saw; for in
<PB N="144" REF="99"/>
my return Home, I run over the same place where
our Chard-Make<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s lay down that Land: but cer∣tain
it was that by foul Weather he was forced into
a Harbor in <HI>Laplan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> called <HI>Arzena,</HI> where by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
continuance of bad Weather he could never re∣turn
out, but was there frozen to Death with al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his Ships Company: so tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of this Voyage
there was no Light given to find a Passage that
way.</P>
<P>The second that Attempted was one Captai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Stephen Burrough,</HI> afterward Comptroller of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

Passage that way to <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan.</HI></P>
<P>The third that Attempted was Captain <HI>Arth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

came to the W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ygates, and passed the Streigh
and came into the Sea to the Eastward, where the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
met with such a vast quantity of Ice and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Weather, that they with great Hazard, Peril, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Labour were forc'd to return, but by foul We<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ther
lost one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> other, and <HI>Pett</HI> was never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
of since; so the Passage through the Waygate
was in <HI>England</HI> laid by, as thought not possi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e
that way, and then the <HI>Hollanders</HI> undertook▪</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="99"/>
The fourth that Attemped it was <HI>William Bar∣rans,</HI>
a well Experienced Navigator and Artist,
sent out of <HI>Holland</HI> by Prince <HI>Morrice</HI> in the
Year 1606. He sailed into the Waygates, but
being entred, he found the same Incumbrance
with Ice that <HI>Pett</HI> and <HI>Jackman</HI> had done before;
so tasting of the Water, and finding of it fresh,
which neither <HI>Burrough, Pett,</HI> nor <HI>Jackman</HI> had
observed; he returned without any hope or pro∣bability
of a Passage that way: but this not dis∣couraging
him, he resolved a second Adventure
to the Northward of <HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> to see what
might be Performed that way.</P>
<P>So in the Year 1607. he set forward, and
arrived on the Coast of <HI>Nova Zembla</HI> in the Lat.
of 73. where he met with Ice; and so coasted
the Shore till he came to the Lat. of 76. where he
could get no farther, and by the Ice was there
driven on Shore, and his Ship broke in peices by
it, and he confined to Winter there, where they
all indured the greatest extremity of Cold that
ever Mortals did: the Winter being past they
with difficulty, in two Boats, got to <HI>Cola</HI> in <HI>Lap∣land,</HI>
but before their arrival there <HI>William Bar∣rans</HI>
dyed, to the great grief of all his Com∣pany.</P>
<P>The next that Attempted it, was that famous
Discoverer of our own Nation Mr. <HI>Henry Hudson,</HI>
in the Year 1610. but he being disheartned by
the Voyage of <HI>Barrans,</HI> attempted but little.</P>
<P>So the thought of a Passage by the North-East
was wholly laid aside, till of late within this
Year or two some Novile Accidents happening;
<PB N="146" REF="100"/>
the Opinion of the North-East was received in
some, and something relating thereunto was
printed in the <HI>Transactions</HI> of the <HI>Royal Society.</HI></P>
<P>Now will I come to the Reasons of that in∣duced
me to believe there was a probability of a
Passage, and then the cause of my undertaking
of the said Voyage.</P>
<P>My first Reason was grounded on the Opinion
of <HI>William Barrans</HI> before spoke of; which was,
that <HI>Nova Zembla</HI> and <HI>Greenland</HI> being 200
Leagues distance between one and the other,
that if he had Steered away North-East from the
North Cape, which would have brought him in
the mid-way betwixt the two Lands, that then
he might have probably found an open Sea, free
from Ice, and so Consequently a Passage; and in
that Opinion he remained to his dying day; for
he did verily believe that the Ice was not to be
met off of either Shore more than 20 Leagues,
and the rest to be free and open, and that his
being too near the Shore of <HI>Nova Zembla</HI> was
the cause of his meeting so much Ice, which was
the overthrow of his Voyage, and if he had
lived, he had purposely intended another Voyage,
and to have sailed the mid-way.</P>
<P>The second Reason that made me believe a
Passage, was a Letter sent out of <HI>Holland;</HI> which
is Published in the <HI>Transactions</HI> of the <HI>Royal Society,</HI>
which affirmeth, the Grand <HI>Zar</HI> of <HI>Moscovia</HI> had
caused a particular Survey of the Land of <HI>Nova
Z<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbla▪</HI> and that they had found it to be no
Island, but to joyn to the main Land of <HI>Tarta∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia▪</HI>
and that to the Northward of it was a free
and open Sea.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="100"/>
The third was a Journal, Printed in <HI>Holland,</HI>
of a Voyage from <HI>Batavia</HI> to <HI>Japan,</HI> wherein
the Ship was cast away upon <HI>Corea,</HI> a Peninsula
of <HI>China,</HI> where by the Natives they were made
Slaves, The Relator having been there 16
years, at last escaped to <HI>Japan,</HI> and writ this
Journal, wherein amongst other Observations
he Relates this; that in a Bay on the Coast of
<HI>Corea,</HI> there doth at several times drive in dead
Whales with <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Harping Irons in
them, which if true had been a great Argument
of a Passage.</P>
<P>The fourth was a Relation of Mr. <HI>Joseph
Moxons,</HI> who being in <HI>Holland</HI> above 20 years
since, heard a <HI>Dutchman</HI> relate (as he did believe
the real Matter of Fact) that he had been un∣der
the Pole it self; and that it was as warm there
as it was at <HI>Amsterdam</HI> in Summer time.</P>
<P>The fifth was a Relation of one Captain
<HI>Goulden,</HI> who had made above thirty Voyages to
<HI>Greenland,</HI> and this he did relate to his Majesty;
that being at <HI>Greenland</HI> some twenty Years ago,
he was in Company with two <HI>Hollanders</HI> to the
Eastward of Edges Island, and that the Whales
not appearing on the Shore, the two <HI>Hollanders</HI>
were resolved to go farther Northerly, and to
Fish amongst the Ice; so they departed from him
and went to the Northward, and in a Fortnights
time returned to him again, and gave it out,
that they had sailed unto the Lat. of 89. that
was within one Degree of the Pole, and that
they did meet with no Ice, but a free and open
Sea, and that there run a very hollow grown Sea
<PB N="146" REF="101"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="147" REF="101"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="148" REF="102"/>
like that of the Bay of <HI>Bisca.</HI> Mr. <HI>Goulden</HI> be∣ing
not satisfied with the bare Relation, they
produced him four Journals out of the two
Ships, which testified the same, and that they
all agreed within four minutes one of the other.</P>
<P>The sixth Inducement that made me believe
there was a Passage, was a Relation from the
same Captain <HI>Goulden,</HI> which was, that all the
drift Wood that they found at <HI>Greenland,</HI> was
eaten with a Sea-Worm to the very Heart, which
if so, it must of necessity come out of a Hot
Climate; for Experience sheweth, that the Worm
biteth in no Cold Country, therefore it could
not be supposed that it came from any other
Country than <HI>Jedzo, Japan,</HI> or some Land there∣about.</P>
<P>The seventh Argument was another Narration
Printed in the <HI>Transactions,</HI> of two Ships of late
that had attempted the Passage, sailed 300
Leagues to the Eastward of <HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> and
had after prosecuted the Voyage, had there not
a difference arose betwixt the Undertakers and the
<HI>East-India-Company,</HI> against whose Interest it was
to suffer it to be found out; so they being a Body,
and more powerful than the other, suppressed it.</P>
<P>These seven were the main Arguments, though
I had many more, that Converted me into the
Opinion of there being a possibility of a Passage
to the Northward of <HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> to <HI>China</HI>
and <HI>Japan;</HI> these being as I supposed, or as any
Man would have done, if he had well consider∣ed
them, to be Matter of Fact, and no Fables.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="102"/>
Besides these Arguments, I had some grounded
upon Reason and Nature, which seemed to be
assistant in the Design of the Attempt, supposing
the aforesaid Arguments to be true, and there
being no Land nor Ice in the way as and Obstacle
to hinder it.</P>
<P>The first was, That being near the North-Pole
in the Summer time, it might be as warm as un∣der
the <HI>Artick</HI> or <HI>Antartick</HI> Circle, or warmer
than with us in the Winter time; for under the
Pole it self, in <HI>June</HI> the Sun being 23 degrees
high, and having no Depression towards the Ho∣rizon,
but always swimming about at the same
hight, might illuminate that part of the Hemis∣phere
with more heat than it doth ours in Win∣ter,
when he is no more then 15 degrees high,
when he is at the highest, that is on the Meri∣dian,
and not more than eight Hours above the
Horizon; or that it might be as hot as any place
near either Polar Circle, because there the Sun
hath a Declination toward the Horizon, and so
the Atmosphere hath almost as much time to cool,
as it hath to heat, which under the Pole should
have no intermission. And one Argument to fa∣vour
this Opinion, was the Relation of most
<HI>Greenland</HI> Traders, who affirm, that the farther
North they go on the Coast of that Land, that
they meet with more green Herbs and Grass,
than they do to the Southward, and consequent∣ly
more Deer.</P>
<P>The second was (that which I most feared)
which was foggy Weather, which I did imagin,
if it should happen, it could not at the same
<PB N="150" REF="103"/>
time blow hard; because it is usual in all other
Climates, when Wind happeneth, to disperse the
Fog; so that if it should so happen, one might lie
by, or make little way till Wind came that one
might see before them.</P>
<P>The third was the Solution of a Doubt that
most men had fancied, which was, that if one
came near the Pole, the Septenteral Declination
of the Needle of the Compass should be quite
taken away, which would of necessity follow if
the Pole of the World, and the Pole of the
Magnet were all one; which I am certain is not,
but is placed so far off, that one might go under
the Pole of the World, if Land or Ice did not
hinder, with this supposition, that one must know
where the Pole Magnetical is, to allow the Va∣riation
that will there happen.</P>
<P>Having considered all these Arguments and
Reasons, with many more I met with, which
will be too tedious to Relate; and the possibility
of a Passage being now imprinted in my Mind
and Inclination, I do intend to shew the Reasons
in short, that induced me to undertake the said
Voyage.</P>
<P>The first was, That the King, whom God Pre∣serve,
should Rcap the Honour and Glory there∣of,
and his Subjects the Profit.</P>
<P>Secondly, There being no Actions within the
Hemisphere of His Majesties Dominions wherein
any vacancy was, but all being supplyed, I chose,
rather than to be Idle, to apply my self to His
Majesty for the Prosecution of the Design; and
being advised to it by a great many of the best
<PB N="151" REF="103"/>
Merchants of the City of <HI>London;</HI> where, after
divers consultations with them, and the Reasons
and Arguments before-mentioned being debated,
it was by many thought Practicable, and by
more thought Profitable to the Nation: the par∣ticulars
to relate would swell into a considerable
Volume.</P>
<P>The third Reason was peculiar to my self,
though when known, to the Use and Benefit of all
Mankind; which was, that having for some years
past framed an Hypothesis of the motion of the
two Magnetical Poles, for two such there be;
and by the Observations of all, or most that
writ of that Subject, with my own Observation,
and costly Experiment upon a great many Places
of the Superficies of the Terrestrial Globe; I
having found out their Motion very near, and
thereby the Inclination of the Magnetical Needle
under the Horizon, in all Latitudes, and all
Longitudes; and Variation of the Compass may
be found in any place in this World, without
assistance of any other Luminary. But not being
so fully satisfied as I might be, if I could come
so near the Pole as was supposed, it prompted
my Inclination, as far as any other Argument
whatever, to Attempt this Voyage.</P>
<P>So having all these Reasons that there was a
Passage, and Reasons for me to unertake it; I
advanced. The first step to it was, I drew a Polar
Draught, whereing I traced all those Navigators
that had Attempted the North-East, which I
presented to His Majesty, and Royal Highness,
and applyed my self to them with the Reasons
<PB N="152" REF="104"/>
aforesaid: which after their Royal Consideration,
and Consult with many Merchants, and Seamen,
that had used to Sail Northward; and if thought
by all feasable, His Majesty was Graciously
pleased to grant me the <HI>Speedwell</HI> Frigot, to be
Manned and Victualled at his Royal Charge,
with all other Appurtenances thereunto belong∣ing.</P>
<P>But because in all Attempts of this Nature it
was not Convenient to venture one Ship alone,
for the many Accidents that are incident to a
single Ship in an Enterprize of this Nature;</P>
<P>Therefore

<P>These Eight Honourable Persons, at their own
proper Charge, bought a Pink, called the <HI>Pro∣sperous,</HI>
of the Burthen of a Hundred and twenty
Tuns, fitted her to Sea, Men, Amunition, Pro∣vision,
and Merchandize, which was such as
was Reasonably purposed to Vend on the Coast
of <HI>Tartaria,</HI> or at <HI>Japan,</HI> if a Passage had been
found.</P>
<P>Now the Ships being fitting out, the <HI>Speedwell</HI>
at <HI>Deptford</HI> in the King's Yard, where the Builder,
<PB N="153" REF="104"/>
Mr. <HI>John Sish,</HI> took no ordinary Care in Strength∣ning
her, and in her Shething, which was as
well performed as in any Ship that ever sailed on
the Sea. Thus being fitted, I was to satisfie most
People the Advantage to our Nation that would
accrue, if there was a Passage.</P>
<P>The first Advantage that I purposed, was, that
on the Coast of <HI>Tartaria,</HI> it being a cold Cli∣mate,
we might Vend our <HI>English</HI> Cloth, which
now is grown a Drug; and certain it is that they
wear Cloth which is sent them from <HI>Russia</HI> and
<HI>Moscovia,</HI> which before it arrive at their Hands
must needs be very Dear in the Price; so if one
could come on their Coast, one might Vend a
great deal more, and abundance Cheaper.</P>
<P>The second Advantage, as would have been,
that in six Weeks one might have sailed to <HI>Japan,</HI>
which in the other Way is nine Months; and
the Passage that way being as hazardous and
perillous as this would have been, if there had
been any Passage by the North-East; for by the
South way, all the way betwixt <HI>Bantam</HI> and <HI>Ja∣pan</HI>
are an innumerable Company of Sands, Sholes,
and Islands, where many Ships are yearly lost, and
all that way one must turn up to Windward, and
be in perpetual fear of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> whom if
we meet, they do their utmost indeavours to De∣stroy
us.</P>
<P>Then if there had been a North-East Passage,
and that one might Sail in such a short time to
<HI>Japan,</HI> the King might send out Men of War to
<HI>Japan,</HI> and force them to Trade; which the other
way is not to be done, because they cannot carry
<PB N="154" REF="105"/>
Provision for so long time; besides the certain
Diseases that are incident to Ships, that have ma∣ny
Men in hot Weather, renders it unpracticable:
these and many other Reasons I used, which
would be too tedious to Relate, they being as
yet fresh in the memory of most I told them to.</P>
<P>Now after all these Arguments and Reasons,
the time of the Year growing on for us to be
gone, we made our Ships ready for the Sea, be∣ing
as well fitted for a Discovery as ever any

more or less from the main body of the Ice; find∣ing
it to be in several strange shapes, resembling
Trees, Beasts, Fishes, Fowles, &amp;c. The main
Body of the Ice being low, but very Craggy,
being many pieces lying close together, and some
a top of each other, and in some places we saw

Sea-Horses, or <HI>Morses,</HI> lying on the Ice, we sent
our Boat to see, and they found two Sea-Horses

could not kill them with Muskets, notwithstand∣ing
we fired 7 Muskets into one of them, nei∣ther

keeping Watch, and are very shy, always lying

fired a Gun, and bore down upon us, crying out
Ice on the Weather-Bow, with that we clap'd the
Helm hard a Weather, Veered out the Main-Sheet
to Ware the Ship; but before the Ship
could Ware, and bring to upon the other Tack,
She struck on a ledge of Rocks which lay sunk.</P>
<P>From 12 at Noon to 11 at Night thick foggy

but at Night the <HI>Prosperous</HI> Pink saw the Sea break
on the Weather-Bow, bearing down upon us
cryed out it was the Ice; with that we presently
bore up round to bring to upon the other Tack,
but our Ship not wearing round, run on a ledge
of Rocks, there stuck fast, but Captain <HI>Flawes</HI>
Ship got clear, wearing more rounder: we fired
several Guns to give Captain <HI>Flawes</HI> notice of our
distress, we used all means possible to get her off,
by carrying out a Hasser and Anchor, and staving
of Water and Beer, and throwing Provision over
Board, but could not get the Ship off, for the
Water did Ebb, and the Ship Sued above 3 Foot;
but when the Flood came it brought a great Sea
with it, and the Ship beat very hard: we used
all means to heave her off, but could not, and
the Ship making Water more than we could
Pump; with that we cut our Masts by the Board,
and sent our Yaul unto the Shore to discover
some place to Land, at whose return aboard
brought word that there was landing, with that
we got up Bread out of the Bread Room, and
brought it up into the great Cabbin: and the
Carpenter made ready to save some Tools, and
necessaries to Rebuild our Long-Boat to save our
lives, if so necessitated, that Captain <HI>Flawes</HI>
should not return to us. So about 12 at Noon
we got all our Men ashore, except two which
were drowned in the Pinnace, by a Sea which
broke into her, just as she put off from the Ship
side: having Bread, Powder, and Provisions in
her, and all lost with the Pinnace. Also, to
our great grief, having nothing but the Long-Boat,
<PB N="167" REF="111"/>
to trust in, to save our lives, which could
not carry above 30 Men of 70. We used all
means to save Bread, but the Ship filling up to the
upper Deck, we were forced to leave her, having
saved but two Bags of Bread, with some pieces
of Pork, and a little Cheese: this being all on
Shore, we carried our Provisions, and other Ne∣cessaries,
upon a Hill, where came to visit us one
of the Natives, which was a Prodigious great white
Bear, which one of our Men shot at, and as we
supposed hit her, which made her run away:
with that we made all hast to build us a Tent to
keep us from the cold, and to keep our Provi∣sions
dry, having saved Canvas for the purpose,
which we laid over Oars and Spars, and threw
up a Trench of Earth round us, to preserve us
from Wild Beasts; but all this time indured much
cold, most of our Men being wet, and having
no firing; therefore all our Hopes and Prayers
were that God would send us the Ship ashore.</P>
<P><HI>Friday, June</HI> 30. A fresh Gale, and very foggy,
with a great Sea; our Ship began to split, and
much Wreck came ashore; so that we got Oars,
Spars and Deals, to build us Tents, and firing,
of which we saved as much as we could; but the
Weather proved very foggy to our great grief,
being we could not expect Captain <HI>Flawes</HI> as
long as the Fog continued. The Wind at West-north-west.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, July</HI> 1. The Wind at North-west a
fresh Gale, the Ship brake in pieces, so that we
had much Wreck came ashore, and Provisions,
which we indeavoured to save with much pains
<PB N="168" REF="112"/>
and trouble, the Sea breaking much on the Shore,
and the Weather very cold and foggy. We saved
two Casks of Flower, some Brandy, and a Butt
of Beer, and a Cask of Oil: the Flower did us
great kindness to save our Bread, for we made of
the Flower Pan-Cakes, and Pudding, and baked
Cakes on Stones, to our great refreshment.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, July</HI> 2. The Wind at West, and very
foggy; we saved more Flower, Butter, and a
few pieces of Beef and Pork, the Cask being
Staved. The Gunneras he was saving of Provi∣sion,
there came a great White Bear to him,
which he shot at, and fell'd her down, but she
rose again and at him; with that there came
more Men and fired at her: she was a very great
one, and very Fat, and the Flesh very good, and
look'd delicate, and Eat well.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, July</HI> 8. The Wind at West-north-west;
a very great Fog, and all our Men in
great despair of our seeing Captain <HI>Flawes:</HI> we
beginning to consider our most miserable Condi∣tion,
and contriving how to save our Lives; the
Long-boat not being able to carry above 30 Men,
and a Deck built on her, and her Wast raised;
with that we concluded to lengthen her 12 Foot,
and to carry all our Men; but upon considerati∣on
of wanting Materials, and the Carpenters bad
assistance, the Men would not agree to have her
cut a sunder, for fear she could not be lengthened;
but were willing to Travel by Land towards the
Waygates, in hopes to find some <HI>Russia</HI> Lodges.
With that we began to raise her Wast, and build
a Deck, the Weather continuing very foggy till
<PB N="169" REF="112"/>
<HI>Saturday</HI> Morning, at which time we espyed
Captain <HI>Flawes</HI> to our great joy; with that we
made presently a great Fire, and sent our Yaul
to meet him, who immediately saw our Fire and
steered into us, and sent his Boat to help to bring
off our Men; with that we broke up our new
Work, which was done to our Long-Boat, and
Lanched her; and about Noon got all on Board
Captain <HI>Flawes,</HI> in good Health.</P>

<HEAD>Now, after the JOURNAL, I do
intend to shew my Conceptions of
the said Voyage, and a true Re∣lation
of our Miscarriage; with
some Observations made in the said
Voyage.</HEAD>
<P>THE first was the following the Opini∣on
of <HI>William Barrans,</HI> that was to
steer directly North-east from the
North Cape, and to fall in the mid∣way
betwixt <HI>Greenland</HI> and <HI>Nova Zembla:</HI> so
having made the Land to the Westward of the
North Cape, the 19. Day of <HI>June,</HI> I steered a∣way
North-east by Compass, which was not so
much by the true Course, because of the variati∣on
that is there Westerly; and the 22. Day at
Noon we saw the main Body of Ice, being in
the Lat. of 76 <HI>d.</HI> and about 60 Leagues to the
Eastward of <HI>Greenland.</HI> At the first seeing of
Ice, I did imagin it had been the Ice that joyned
to <HI>Greenland;</HI> and that if I went more Easterly
there might be a free Sea; so I ran close by the
Ice, it lying away. East-south-east; and West-north-west,
and every League, or less, that we
<PB N="186" REF="121"/>
ran, we met with a Cape of Ice; so when we
were about that, we could see no Ice to the
Northward; so standing in North-east, sometimes
two Glasses, that is one hour, we could see more
Ice a Head, and then we were forced to go out
the same way we came in, and thus I continued
Coasting the Ice, sometimes with great hopes of
a clear Sea, and then again disheartened by see∣ing
more Ice; till at last I had no hopes at all,
which was when I saw the Land of <HI>Nova Zembla,</HI>
and the Ice joyn to it. So here the Opinion of
<HI>William Barrans</HI> was Confuted, and all the
rest of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Relations, which certainly are
all forged abusive Pamphlets; as also the Relati∣ons
of our own Countrymen. But certainly, if
Men did really consider the many individual
dangers and mischiefs that comes upon the
broaching of such untruths, they would never do
it; for I do now verily believe that if there be no
Land to the Northward of the Lat. of 80 <HI>d.</HI> that
the Sea that is there is all frozen, and always
continueth so; for I that could get no farther
than 76 <HI>d.</HI> found it so frozen without intermissi∣on;
and some of the Ice that we saw, that was
on the main Body of it, had been conveyed 10
Degrees more Southward, would have taken
some Centuries of Years to Thaw it: for the
loose Ice that lay about the Edges of the main
Body, was not more than a Foot thick in some
pieces above the Superficies of the Water, and
the rest of the Cake that was sunk, was more
than 18 Foot below. So I conclude that those
vast Mountains that were on the main Body were
<PB N="187" REF="121"/>
all on Shore, as of necessity they must, if they
hold the same proportion; and considering the
shallowness of the Water, which I found all along
the Ice, which in the mid-way between the two
Lands, I found to be no more than 70 Fathom,
was doubtless a sign that to the Northward is
Land, and that the main Body of Ice that lyeth
crusted about the Shore, may be 20 Leagues or
more, and that <HI>Nova Zembla</HI> and <HI>Greenland</HI> are
the same Continent; for if there had been any
Passage, there would have been some Current,
which I could never, or very hardly find to be
any, and the little that was run East-south-east
along the Ice, which is nothing else but a small
Tide which riseth some 8 Foot. Thus the Ice
having been an obstacle in our way, as also the
cause of my coming so far to the Eastward,
which before I never intended.</P>
<P>I will come to the misfortune that happened
to us in the loss of our Ship: which was thus,
being amongst the Ice the 29. Day of <HI>June</HI> in the
Morning, we had like to have been inclosed in
it: it proving likewise foggy Weather, I stood
out to the Southward, thinking to lye there till
fairer Weather, or to spend some time to the
Southward, and then come up to the Ice again,
to see if there might be any alteration in it as to
its removal either East, West, North, or south;
but all this Day it proved foggy dirty Weahter,
the Wind being at West: so we lay South-south-west
with the Stem, and by our Judgment and
Reckoning, the Westermost Land of <HI>Nova Zem∣bla</HI>
bore from us East-south-east, that was 4 Points
<PB N="188" REF="122"/>
under our Lee Bow. But such was our misfor∣tune
that it proved not so, for about 10 of the
Clock Captain <HI>Flawes,</HI> being upon our Weather
Quarter, fired a Gun and bore to me, and called
out that there was Ice a Head; then I looking
out a Head, saw something white just under the
Bow, which presently I perceived to be a breath,
and no Ice; now if I had staied with the Ship,
Captain <HI>Flawes</HI> being to Windward, I should
have been on Board of him, and then certainly
we had been both lost, so I was forced to bear
up with hope that I might get clear of it; but
the Ship being a great while wearing struck on
the Rock, her Head lying to Seaward, which if
it had not, but that the Broadside had been to
the Sea we had all perished without Gods great
mercy: Captain <HI>Flawes</HI> in the mean time (being
a shorter Ship) wore round, and came close un∣der
our Stern, and with great Providence escaped,
and stood off to Sea: here we lay beating on the
Rock in most cruel manner for the space of 3 or 4
hours, using all possible means to save her, but all in
vain, for it blew so hard that it was impossible to
carry out an Anchor capable to do us any service,
though we had an opportunity to carry a small
Anchor, and warp to hall▪ another out by, which
signified but little: the Ship all this while lay, and
at the end of 4 or 5 hours we saw Land close un∣der
our Stern, to the great amazement of us all,
which before we could not see for the foggy
Weather; so I commanded the Men to get out
our Boats before our Mast came by the Board,
which was done. I sent the Boatswain toward
<PB N="189" REF="122"/>
the Shore in the Pinnace, to see if there was any
possibility of landing, which I much feared, be∣cause
the Sea ran so high. In half an hour he
returned with this answer, that it was impossible
to save a Man, the Sea ran so high, and the Snow
being in high Clifts on Shore was unaccessible,
which was but bad tidings: so then it was high
time to think on the safety of our Souls, and we
went all together to Prayers, to beseech God to
have Mercy on us, for now nothing but indi∣vidual
ruin appeared before our Eyes: after
Prayers being done it proved a little clearer
Weather; and I looking over the Stern saw a
small Beach directly with the Stern of the Ship,
where I thought might be some possibility of
landing; so I sent the Pinnace again with some
Men to be landed, but they durst not venture on
Shore; so I sent the Long-Boat with some 20
Men to Land, who attempted it, and got safe on
Shore; so they in the Pinnace seeing that, fol∣lowed
them and their Men likewise, and both
returned on Board again: now the Men on the
Shore sent to me desire some Fire-Arms and Am∣munition,
for there was many Bears on Shore; so
I caused to be put into the Pinnace two Barrels
of Powder that we had saved dry, before the
Ship was belged, and some small Arms, and some
Provision, with my own Papers, and Mony;
but as she put off from the Ship side, a Sea over∣set
her, so that all was lost with the life of one
Man, by name <HI>John Bosman,</HI> being Coopers
Mate, and several others taken up for dead; the
Long-Boat being then on Shore to Land more
<PB N="190" REF="123"/>
Men, and they hearing us call from aboard,
(when as then we could not see the Shore) they
came on Board and saved the Men, but the Pin∣nace
was all broke to pieces, which was no small
grief to us; so the Long-Boat being on Board,
and the Sea running prodigious high, the Boat∣swain
and some others would compel me and
the Lieutenant to leave the Ship, saying that it
was impossible for the Boat to live any longer in
that Sea, and that they had rather be drowned
than I; but desiring me when I came on Shore
(if it were possible) to send the Boat again for
them: so I being half way on Shore the Ship
over-set; so I made all the hast possible to Land
them Men I had in the Boat, and having landed
them I went off to the Ship again to save those
poor Men that had been so kind to me before:
so with great hazard I got with the Boat to the
Quarter of the Ship, and they came down the
Ladder into the Boat, only one Man who was
left for dead, which was one that had been cast
away in the Pinnace, whose name was <HI>Alexander
Frazor,</HI> a very pretty Saylor. So I returned to
the Shore and got safe to Land, though very wet
and cold; so we hauled up the Boat on Shore,
and went up the Land about a flightshoot, where
our Men were making a Fire, and a Tent with
Canvas and Oars, which we had saved for that
Purpose; so we lay all that Night very cold, wet,
and weary. The next Morning the Man that
we left on Board recovered, and got unto the
Mizen-Top; for that Mast we left standing when
we came away, the other we had cut all down.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="123"/>
The Ship laboured and beat violently, but it
blew so hard, and the Sea ran so high that it
was impossible to save him; so the Weather con∣tinuing
blowing, with extreme Fogs, and with
Frost and Snow, and all the ill compacted Wea∣ther
that could be imagined together. We built
more Tents to preserve our selves, and the Ship
breaking in pieces came all ashore to the same
place where we landed, which served for shelter
and Firing; besides there came to us some
Hogsheads of Flower, and Brandy good store,
which was no little Comfort in our great Extre∣mity.
Here we lay betwixt hope and despair,
hoping for fair Weather that Captian <HI>Flawes</HI>
might find us, which was impossible that ever he
should do if it continued foggy; and some de∣spairing
of his being safe, but that he might be
Lost as well as we. But supposing we never was
to see him again, I was resolved to try the utmost
to save as many as I could in the Long-Boat; in
order thereunto we raised her two Foot, and
laid a Deck upon her to keep the Sea out as much
as was possible and with this Boat and 30 Men.
(for she could carry no more) I intended to Row
and Sail to <HI>Russia</HI> but the Men not being satisfied
who should be the Men, began to be very un∣ruly
in their mind and behaviour; every one
having as much reason to save himself as ano∣ther,
some holding Consultation to stave the
Boat, and all to run the like Fortune. But here
Brandy was our best Friend, for it kept them al∣waies
Fox'd, so that in all their Designs I could
prevent them; some were of the mind to go by
<PB N="192" REF="124"/>
Land, but that I knew was impossible to any
Man; neither had we Provisions, nor Ammuni∣tion
to defend us from the Wild Beasts; and if it
had been passable, that is any going on the ground
for Bogs, that they would have met with Rivers
that they knew not whether to go: so there be∣ing
no probability of going by Land, nor for
any to attempt going in the Boat, without forty
Men having been first destroyed. I will leave it
to the consideratiion of any, whither we were
not in a very miserable condition without Divine
Providence: to Write my thought I had at that
time, to save as many Men as I could, it is not
pertinent at all to the Discourse, since it cannot
but be imagined to be Tragical. The Weather
continued still very bad with Fogs, Snow, Rain,
and Frost, till the 9. Day of our being on Shore,
which was the 8. Day of <HI>July,</HI> when in the Morn∣ing
it cleared up, and to our great joy, one of
the Sailors cried out a Sail, which proved Cap∣tain
<HI>Flawes,</HI> as reasonable may be imagined; so
we set fire to our Town that he might see where
we was, which he presently saw, so come to us,
and sent his Boat to us (but before I went off) I
Writ a brief Relation of the intention of the
Voyage, with the Accidents that had befallen us,
and put it in a Glass-Bottle, and left it in the
Fortification I had there built. So by twelve a
Clock we all got safe on Board, but left all on
Shore that we had saved from the Ship; for we
much feared it should prove foggy again.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="geographical description">
<PB N="193" REF="124"/>
<HEAD>Now I intend to give a brief descri∣ption
of the Land, and the Obser∣vations
I made there.</HEAD>
<P><HI>NOva Zembla,</HI> is so called by the <HI>Russians,</HI>
which signifieth <HI>New Land</HI> in their
Language; to prove it is either an
Island, or whither it joyneth to the
Continent of <HI>Tartaria,</HI> would be a very hard
Task, nor is it certainly known to any; for by
Circumstances I think it impossible to prove, and
by Experience the search thereof is so impossible
that it will hardly be tryed.</P>
<P>But let it be either, I think the matter is not
much, since it is the most miserable Country that
lyeth on the Foundation of the Earth; a Coun∣try
most part of it covered perpetually with Snow,
and that that is bare is not to be walked on, be∣ing
like Bogs, upon whose Superficies grows a
kind of Moss; which beareth a small blue and
yellow Flower, and this is all the Product of the
Earth of this Country. Under the superficies of
this Earth, about two Foot deep, after we had dug
so low, we came to a firm Body of Ice; which, as
I think, was never heard of before: so these Men
that did imagin, if they were forced to Winter
to the Northward, would dig Caves in the Earth
to preserve themselves from cold, would find
<PB N="194" REF="125"/>
here but very bad Lodging. The Snow lieth
here contrary to what it doth in any other Coun∣try;
for in all other Climates the Snow melteth
soonest away near the Sea side, but here the Sea
beateth against the snowy Clifts, which in some
places are as high as either of the Forelands in
<HI>Kent:</HI> the Sea has washed underneath the Snow
a prodigious way, and the Snow over hanging,
most fearful to behold, and up from the Water
side, upon the first Ridge of Hills, the Snow
was melted till you come to the next Ridge,
which are Mountains, and they all the way up
are covered with Snow, which I believe hath
lain there evere since the Creation; but after we
had ascended this, which in some places was al∣most
Perpendicular, we came to the top of all
the Mountains, as we supposed, for we could
not see far; for we could hardly see one the other
the Fog was so thick, and remained so all the
time we were in the Country; but on the top of
these Hills we found it bare from Snow, and in∣different
good walking. The best that I found
in the Country were only Bears: I continued on
the top of those Hills fome two hours, and went
as far as was convenient, that we might find the
way back again. Here I found the Track of
many large Deer, also we found an Horn of
Beam of Deer; besides Deer, there be abundance
of large White Bears, and some Foxes, and a
little Creature much like a Coney, but not so
big as a Rat; and some few little Birds like
Larks, and these be all the Beasts or Fowls
we found in the Country. Every quarter of a
<PB N="195" REF="125"/>
Mile there runneth down from the Hills into the
Sea a small Rivulet of very good Water, which
is melted from Snow. Upon the Hills we found
abundance of Slate-stone, which made it good
walking; but at the Sea side, where the Rivu∣let
came down, we found very good Black
Marble, with White Veins in it.</P>
<P>The Point where we lost our Ship I called
Point <HI>Speedill:</HI> the high Hills I called King
<HI>Charles</HI>'s Snow Hills; and the next Point to the
Southward, which is the Westermost Point of
<HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> I named <HI>James</HI> Foreland, and the
Point to the Northward, <HI>York</HI> Point. Point <HI>Speedill</HI>
lieth in the Lat. of 74 <HI>d.</HI> 30 <HI>m.</HI> North, and in
the Longitude East from the City of <HI>London</HI> 63 <HI>d.</HI>
00 <HI>m.</HI> The variation of the Compass is 13 <HI>d.</HI>
West, and it is full Sea at South-west Moon.
The Tide riseth 8 Foot, and setteth directly
upon the Shore, which is a certain sign that there
is no Passage to the Northward. The Sea Wa∣ter,
about the Ice and Land, is very salt, and
much salter than any I ever tasted, and a great
deal heavier, and I may certainly say the clearest
in the World, for I could see the ground very
plain in 80 Fathom Water, which is 480 Foot,
there being few Steeples so high as that was
deep, and I could see the Shells at the bottom
very plain.</P>
<P>If the Voyage had succeeded, I should, God
willing, have given a more full and nice account
of all the Experiments I had, and should have
made, especially those of the Magnet, which I
forbare here to mention, because I intended to
<PB N="196" REF="126"/>
Publish them in a Treatise by themselves: so
having with the Ship lost all my Papers, and
with them all I had in the World beside; I most
humbly beg Pardon that I have given no more

VOYAGE
INTO
Spitzbergen and Greenland:
CONTAINING
The Passages of the whole voyage, toge∣ther

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Voyage from the Elbe to Spitz∣bergen.</HEAD>
<P>WE set Sail the 15th of <HI>April,</HI> 1671.
about noon from the <HI>Elbe.</HI> The Wind
was North-east. At night, when
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e came by the <HI>Hilge-land,</HI> it bore to North-west.
The name of the Ship was <HI>Jones in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hale, Peter Peterson</HI> of <HI>Friseland</HI> Master.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="131"/>
The 27th we had storms, hail and snow,
with very cold weather, the wind North-east
and by east, we were in 71 degrees, and came
to the Ice, and turned back again. The <HI>Island</HI>
of<HI>John Maien</HI> bore from us South-west and
by west, as near as we could guess within ten
Miles. We might have seen the Island plain
enough, but the Air was haizy and full of
fogs and snow, so that we could not see far.
About noon it blew a storm, whereupon we
took down our Top-sails, and furling our Main∣sail,
drove with the Missen-sail towards South-east.</P>
<P>The 29th it was foggy all day, the wind
North east and by north, we came to the Ice,
and sailed from it again, as you may see in the
Plate<HI>A.</HI></P>
<P>The 3cth, the first Sunday after <HI>Easter,</HI> was
foggy, with rain and snow, the wind at North,
at night we came to the Ice, but sailed from it
again; the Sea was tempestuous, and tossed
our Ship very much.</P>
<P>The 3d of <HI>May</HI> was cold, snowy, with hail,
and misty Sun-shine, the wind North-west and
by west, the Sun set no more, we saw it as
well by night as by day.</P>
<P>The fourth we had snow, hail, and gloomy
Sun-shine, with cold weather, but not exces∣sive,
the wind at North-west, the weather e∣very
day unconstant. Here we saw abundance
of <HI>Seales,</HI> they jump'd out of the water before
the Ship, and which was strange, they would
stand half out of the water, and as it were
dance together.</P>
<P>The 5th-in the forenoon it was moderately
cold, and Sun-shine, but toward noon darkish
and cloudy, with snow and great frost, the
<PB N="3" REF="131"/>
wind North-west and by North. We saw dai∣ly
many Ships, failing about the Ice, I obser∣ved
that as they passed by one another, they
haled one another, crying <HI>Holla,</HI> and asked
each other how many fish they had caught,
but they would not stick sometimes to tell more
then they had. When it was windy, that they
could not hear one another, they waved their
Hats, to signifie the number caught. But when
they have their full Fraight of <HI>Whales,</HI> they put
up their great Flag as a sign thereof; then if
any hath a Message to be sent, he delivers it to
them, as you may see in the Plate <HI>A</HI> by <HI>A.</HI></P>
<P>The 7th we had moderate frost, clouds and
snow with rain. In the evening we sailed to
the Ice, the wind was quite contrary to us, and
the Ice too small, wherefore we sailed from it.
In the afternoon we saw <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> the South
point of the North-foreland, we supposed it
the true Harbour. The Land appeared like a
dark Cloud, full of white streeks, we turned
to the West again, that is, according to the
Compass, which is als to be understood of the
Ice and Harbour.</P>
<P>The 9th was the same weather, and cold as
before, the Wind South-west and by west.
In the afternoon a <HI>Fin-fish</HI> swam by our Ship,
which we took at first to be a <HI>Whale,</HI> before we
saw the high fins of his tail, and came near to
it. We had let down our Sloop from the Ship,
but that labour was lost, for he was not worth
taking.</P>
<P>From the 25th of <HI>April</HI> to this day, we had
not taken the Sun's altitude, we were then in
70 degrees and 3 minutes, and sailed towards
the North and the Ice. It may seem strange,
that we so often sailed to the Ice and from it
<PB N="4" REF="132"/>
again, but I shall give you a reason for that
hereafter.</P>
<P>The12th it was stormy and excessive cold,
the wind North▪ and we had the greatest frosts
in this Month of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>On the 14th the wind was North-west, fine
weather, with Sun-shine, we were within 75
degrees and 22 minutes. We told twenty Ships
about us, the Sea was very even, and we hard∣ly
felt any wind, yet it was very cold.</P>
<P>In this place the Sea becomes smooth pre∣sently
again after a storm, chiefly when the
wind blows from the Ice; but when it blows
off the Sea, it always makes a great Sea.</P>
<P>The same day we saw a <HI>Whale</HI> not far off from
our Ship, we put out four Boats from on board
after him, but this labour was also in vain, for
he run under water, and saw him no more.</P>
<P>On the 19th we had a dull Sun-shine, the
wind was North, and it was so calm that we
could hardly feel it; we rowed in the Ship∣boat
to the Ice, and killed two <HI>Sea-hounds</HI> or
<HI>Seales;</HI> there were so many of them on the Ice
that they could not be numbred.</P>
<P>On the 20th it was exceeding cold, so that
the very Sea was all frozen over; yet it was
so calm and still, that we could hardly perceive
the wind, which was North; there were nine
Ships in our Company which sailed about the
Ice; we found still the longer we sailed the
bigger the Ice.</P>
<P>On the 21th (which was the fourth Sunday
after <HI>Easter</HI>) we sailed into the Ice in the fore∣noon,
with another <HI>Hamburger</HI>-ship, called the
<HI>Le peler,</HI> with 8 <HI>Hollanders.</HI> We fixed our Ship
with Ice-hooks to a large Ice-field, when the
Sun was South-west and by south; we num-bred
<PB REF="132"/>
<PB REF="133"/>
<FIGURE>

<PB REF="134"/>
<PB N="5" REF="134"/>
30 Ships in the Sea; they lay as it
were in an Harbour or Haven (as you may see
Plate <HI>A</HI> at <HI>B.</HI>) Thus they venture their Ships in
the Ice with great hazzard.</P>
<P>On the 30th it was fair weather in the morn∣ing,
snowy about noon, the wind was South∣west
and very calm. We rowed in the great
Sloop, before the Ship, farther into the Ice. In
the morning we heard a <HI>Whale</HI> blow, when the
Sun was in the East, and brought the <HI>Whale</HI> to
the Ship, when the Sun was at South-west and
by east; the same day we cut the Fat from it,
and filled with it 70 Barrels (which they call
Kardels.) By this fish we found abundance of
Birds, most of them were <HI>Mallemucks,</HI> (that is
to say foolish Gnats) which were so greedy of
their food, that we kill'd them with sticks.
This fish was found out by the Birds, for we
saw every where by them in the Sea where the
Whale had been, for he was wounded by an
Harping Iron that stuck still in his flesh, and he
had also spent himself with hard swimming;
he blowed also very hollow, he stank alive, and
the birds fed upon him. This <HI>Whale</HI> fermented
when it was dead, and the steam that came
from it inflamed our eyes, and made them sore.
See Tab. <HI>A</HI> at <HI>a.</HI></P>
<P>This same night <HI>Cornelius Seaman</HI> lost his Ship
by the squeezing and crushing together of the
Ice, for in this place are very great Sheets or
Islands of Ice, and the Seamen call it <HI>West-Ice,</HI> be∣cause
it lieth towards the West, as you may see
in the Plate <HI>B</HI> marked with <HI>b.</HI></P>
<P>On the 2d of <HI>June</HI> we had a severe frost in
the forenoon, and in the night we saw the
Moon very pale, as it used to look in the day
time in our Country, with clear Sun-shine,
<PB N="6" REF="135"/>
whereupon followed mist and snow, the wind
North-east and by north.</P>
<P>In the morning, <HI>June</HI> the 4th, we were a
hunting again after a <HI>Whale,</HI> and we came so
near unto one, that the Harponier was just a
going to fling his Harpoon into her, but she
sunk down behind, and held her head out of
the water, and so sunk down like a stone (as
is to be seen by <HI>d</HI> on the cut <HI>A</HI>) and we saw
her no more; it was very like that the great
Ice-field was full of holes in the middle, so
that the <HI>Whale</HI> could fetch breath underneath
the Ice. A great many more Ships lay about
this sheet of Ice, one hunted the <HI>Whales</HI> to the
other, and so they were frighted, and became
very shy. So one gets as many fishes as the o∣ther,
and sometimes they all get one. We were
there several times a hunting that very day, and
yet we got never a one.</P>
<P>On the 8th it was foggy, and snowed all day;
we saw that day very many (<HI>Sea-dogs</HI> or) <HI>Seales</HI>
on the Ice about the Sea-side, so we set out a
Boat and killed 15 of them.</P>
<P>On the 12th it was cold and stormy all day,
at night Sun-shine; he that takes not exact no∣tice,
knows no difference whether it by day or
night.</P>
<P>On the 13th in the afternoon it was windy
and foggy, we were in 77 degrees; we sailed
along by the Ice somewhat easterly towards
<HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> as is to be seen in the Cut <HI>A</HI> at <HI>e.</HI>
That night we saw more then 20 <HI>Whales</HI> that
run one after another towards the Ice; out of
them we got our second fish, which was a
male one; and this fish, when they wounded
him with Lances, bled very much, so that the
Sea was tinged by it where he swam: we brought
<PB N="7" REF="135"/>
him to the Ship when the Sun was in
the North: for the Sun is the Clock to the
Seamen in <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> for else they would live
without order, and mistake in the usual seven
weekly days.</P>
<P>On the 14th it was cold and windy, the night
foggy, the wind blew West, that day we came
to <HI>Hans Lichtenberg.</HI></P>
<P>We arrived at <HI>Spitzbergen, June</HI> the 14th.
First we came to the <HI>Foreland</HI> thereof, then to
the seven <HI>Ice-hills</HI> or Mountains, then we passed
the Harbour or Bay of the <HI>Hamburgers, Mag∣dalens,
English</HI> men and <HI>Danes,</HI> and sailed into
the South-bay: we were followed by 7 Ships,
3 <HI>Hamburgers</HI> and 4 <HI>Hollanders,</HI> as is to be seen
by <HI>a</HI> in the Plate <HI>C.</HI> For here it is just the
same, as when they will sail into the Ice, if
more then one is there, for no body cares to
be the first, because they do not know in what
condition the Harbour or the Ice is within.
In our Voyage thither we saw no Ice at all, un∣til
we came to <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> for the wind had
blown it all away; in the night we did cut off
the fat of the fish, and filled with it 65 Kardels
or Vessels.</P>
<P>That night we sailed with three Boats into
the <HI>English</HI> Harbour or Bay, and saw a <HI>Whale,</HI>
and flung into him three Harpoons, and threw
our Lances into him; the <HI>Whale</HI> run under∣neath
the small Ice, and remained a great while
under water before he came up again, and then
ran but a very little way before he came up a∣gain;
and this he repeated very often, so that
we were forced to wait on him above half an
hour, before he came from underneath the Ice.
The Harpoons broke out at length, and we lost
him. On the Ice we saw two great <HI>Sea-horses</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="136"/>
or <HI>Morses,</HI> that were got upon the sheet of Ice,
through a hole that was in it, and were asleep;
we cut off their return by covering the hole
with a piece of Ice; then we awaken'd them
with our Lances, and they began to defend
themselves for a while before they were killed.
We saw also many White-fish.</P>
<P>On the 22th we had very fair weather, and
pretty warm; we were by <HI>Rehenfelt (Deersfeild)</HI>
where the Ice stood firm: we saw six <HI>Whales,</HI>
and got one of them that was a male, and our
third fish; he was kill'd at night when the Sun
stood westward: this fish was kill'd by one
man, who flung the Harpoon into him; and
kill'd him also, while the other Boats were bu∣sie
in pursuing or hunting after another <HI>Whale.</HI>
This fish run to the Ice, and before he died,
beat about him with his tail; the Ice setled a∣bout
him so that the other Boats could not
come to this Boat to assist him, till the Ice se∣parated
again, that they might row, when they
tied one Boat behind the other, and so towed
the <HI>Whale</HI> to the great Ship, where they cut him
up into the Vessels, and filled with him 45 Bar∣rels.
This night the Sun shined very bright∣ly.</P>
<P>On the 29th we had fair weather, Sun-shine
and calm. On the same day we sailed before
the wide Harbour or Bay; where we found a
great quantity of the fat of a <HI>Whale,</HI> three Ves∣sels
full, together with the Image of St. <HI>Nicho∣las,</HI>
which stood behind a Ship that was lost,
driving in the Sea. There was also here and
there still much Ice.</P>
<P>On the 1st of <HI>July</HI> about noon, two <HI>Whale</HI>
came near to our Ship; we saw that they had
a mind to couple together; we set our Boat
<PB N="9" REF="136"/>
for them, and the Harpoonier hit the female,
which when the other found, he did not stay
at all, but made away. The female run all
along above the water straight forward, beating
about with her tail and fins, so that we durst
not come near to lance her; yet one of our
Harpooniers was so fool hardy to venture too
near to the fish, which saluted him with a stroak
of her tail over his back so vehemently, that
he had much ado to recover his breath again.
Those in the other Boat, to shew their valour
also, hasten'd to the fish, which overturned their
Boat, so that the Harpoonier was forced to
dive for it, and hide his head underneath the
water; the rest did the same; they thought it
very long before they came out, for it was cold,
so that they came quaking to the Ship again.</P>
<P>In the same morning a <HI>Whale</HI> appear'd near
our Ship before the wide Harbour, we put out
four Boats from our Ship after him, but two
<HI>Holland</HI> Ships were about half a League from
us, one of them sent out a Boat towards us;
we used great diligence and care to take him,
but the fish came up just before the <HI>Dutchman</HI>'s
Boat, and was struck by him with a Harpoon.
Thus he took the bread out of our mouths.</P>
<P>On the 2d of <HI>July</HI> we had Sun-shine all day
and night long, and it was pretty warm with∣al;
about midnight we went a hunting, and
caught the fifth fish, who was a male; we cut
the fat off, and flung it into the Forecastle.
This is done when they are very busie in <HI>Whale</HI>
catching, that they may not lose time, then
they cut great pieces off of the <HI>Whale,</HI> that
they may have done the sooner, for it doth
not harm the fat if it should lie so for several
days; nay, some reckon it to be the better
<PB N="10" REF="137"/>
for it, but that cannot be, for the fat runs away
from it.</P>
<P>On the 4th we had Sun-shine all day and
night. We still were <HI>Whale-</HI> hunting, and that
night we got the sixth fish, a male also, he held
49 <HI>Kardels</HI> of fat.</P>
<P>On the 3d and 4th day of <HI>July</HI> we saw more
<HI>Whales</HI> than we did in all our Voyage.</P>
<P>On the 5th of <HI>July</HI> in the forenoon it was
bright Sun-shine, and pretty warm, in the af∣ternoon
it was foggy, at night Sun-shine again,
which lasted all the night. We hunted all that
day long, and in the morning we struck a
<HI>Whale</HI> before the <HI>Weigatt;</HI> this fish run round
about under the water, and so fastned the Line
whereon our Harpoon was about a Rock, so
that the Harpoon lost its hold, and that fish got
away. This <HI>Whale</HI> did blow the water so fierce∣ly,
that one might hear it at a Leagues di∣stance.</P>
<P>The same day about noon, the wind south,
and Sun-shine, we got the seventh fish, which
was a female, and had 45 <HI>Kardels</HI> of fat; this
we cut also into the Hold, and so we sailed
from <HI>Weigatt,</HI> a little toward the west before
the <HI>Muscle-Harbour,</HI> where we dropped our An∣chor;
we were employed with cutting the
great pieces of fat into lesser pieces, to fill our
<HI>Kardels</HI> with them: in the mean while the
wind turned to North-west and west, and the
single Anchor was dragg'd by the Ship, so we
dropped another, and would have weigh'd up
the former, but our Cable broke, the Anchor
being fastned to a Rock.</P>
<P>On the 6th we had the same weather, and
warm Sun-shine all night. Hard by us rode a
<HI>Hollander,</HI> and the Ships crew busie in cutting
<PB N="11" REF="137"/>
the fat of a <HI>Whale,</HI> when the fish burst with so
great a bounce, as if a Canon had been dis∣charged,
and bespattered the Workmen all o∣ver.</P>
<P>On the 8th the wind turned North-west,
with snow and rain. We were forced to leave
one of our Anchors, and thank'd God for get∣ting
off from Land, for the Ice came on fierce∣ly
upon us; at night the wind was laid, and it
was colder, although the Sun shined.</P>
<P>On the 9th we got another male <HI>Whale,</HI> be∣ing
the eighth, which was yellow underneath
the head; we filled with him 54 <HI>Kardels</HI> with
fat; the Sun shined all night.</P>
<P>On the 12th we had gloomy Sun-shine all
day. At night we sailed with three Boats into
the Ice before the <HI>Weigatt,</HI> and got three white
Bears, an old one with two young ones, they
swam in the water like fish. On the Ice lay
abundance of <HI>Sea-horses,</HI> and the further we
came into the Ice there were the more of them,
we rowed up to them, and when we came
near to them we killed ten of them, the rest
came all about our Boat, and beat holes through
the sides of the Boat, so that we took in a∣bundance
of water, we were forced at length
to row away from them because of their great
number, for they gathered themselves more
and more together; they pursued us as long as
we could see them, very furiously. Afterwards
we met with another very great one who lay
in the water fast asleep, but when he felt our
Harpoon within him he was very much fright∣ned,
and ran away before the Boat again, where
he was soon eased of his fright by our Lances.
We saw but very few <HI>Whales</HI> more, and those
we did see were quite wild, that we could not
<PB N="12" REF="138"/>
come near them. That night it was so dark
and foggy, that we could hardly see the Ships
length; we might have got <HI>Sea-horses</HI> enough,
but we were afraid of loosing our Ships, for
we had examples enough of them that had lost
their Ships, and could not come to them a∣gain,
but have been forced to return home
in other Ships. When after this manner any
have lost their Ships, and cannot be seen▪ they
discharge a Cannon from the Ship, or sound
the Trumpets, or Haut-boys, according as they
are provided in their Ships, that the men that
are lost may find their Ship again.</P>
<P>On the 13th we had cloudy Sun-shine, the
wind towards night turned to North-east and
by east. The Ice came a floating down apace,
we sailed from the South-east Land to the west,
and we could but just get through by the North
side from the <HI>Bear-Harbour</HI> or Bay. We sailed
on to the <HI>Rehenfelt</HI> (or <HI>Deer-field)</HI> where the Ice
was already fixed to the Land, so that we
could but just get through; we sailed further
to the <HI>Vogelsanck (Birds-song)</HI> as you may see by
<HI>b</HI> in the Plate <HI>D.</HI> Then we turned toward
the East with a North-east wind, in company
with twelve Ships more, to see whether there
were any more <HI>Whales</HI> left, with <HI>George</HI> and
<HI>Cornelius Mangelsen,</HI> and <HI>Michael Appel,</HI> who sail∣ed
in four fathoms water, and touched upon
the wreck of a Ship that was lost there.</P>
<P>On the 14th in the morning we sailed still
amongst the Ice, the wind being North-east
and by east; we had a fogg all that day, with
Sun-shine, with a Rainbow of two colours,
white and pale yellow, and it was very cold,
and we saw the Sun a great deal lower.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="138"/>
On the 15th it was windy, cold, and foggy
the whole day; the wind turned North-west,
and the Ice came on in abundance, so that
we could hardly sail, for it was every where
full of small sheets of Ice. At this time there
were many ships beset with Ice, in the <HI>Deer</HI> or
<HI>Muscle-Bay.</HI> We sailed all along near the shoar,
and at night we entred the <HI>South-Harbour</HI>
(marked with <HI>c</HI> in the Cut <HI>D</HI>) where 28 Ships
lay at Anchor, 8 whereof were <HI>Hamburgers,</HI>
the rest <HI>Dutchmen.</HI> From that time, when we
sailed out of the <HI>South-haven,</HI> we kept always
within sight of the Land, and saw it always,
except it was foggy; and so long the Skippers
stay by the Ice, to see whether there is any
more <HI>Whales</HI> to be had. That night we fetched
water from the Land, near the <HI>Cookery</HI> of <HI>Har∣lingen,</HI>
out of a hole, marked by <HI>b</HI> in the
Plate <HI>C.</HI></P>
<P>On the 16th in the morning we saw the
Moon, and afterwards it was windy, with a∣bundance
of snow.</P>
<P>On the 18th we had fair weather, with Sun∣shine,
and we were also becalmed that we could
not sail, wherefore we towed with a Boat into
the <HI>Danish</HI> Harbour, to gather some Herbs from
the Rocks. In the <HI>South-Haven</HI> rode 30 Ships
at Anchor.</P>
<P>On the 19th we had warm Sun-shine and fair
weather, but in the night stormy and rain.</P>
<P>On the 20th storms, rain, and a great deal
of snow, the wind South-west.</P>
<P>On the 21th rain all day long.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of our home Voyage from Spitzbergen

<P>ON the 22th day of <HI>July</HI> in the morn∣ing,
when the Sun was North-east,
we waied our Anchors, and sailed out
of the <HI>South-Haven:</HI> we had a fogg all day
long, and Sun-shine at night; in the night we
saw abundance of <HI>Fin-fishes.</HI></P>
<P>On the 24th it was so warm with Sun-shine,
that the Tarr wherewith the Ship was daubed
over melted; we drove, it being calm, before
the Haven or Bay of <HI>Magdalen.</HI></P>
<P>On the 25th it was cloudy, and Sun-shine,
but cold withal; at night we came to the <HI>Fore∣lands;</HI>
the night was foggy, the wind South-west.</P>
<P>On the 26th we had the very same wea∣ther
all day, the Sun was very low in the night.</P>
<P>On the 28th we turned from the side of
the <HI>North-Foreland</HI> towards the west, when
the Sun was South-east; and we did sail South-west
and by west towards the Sea; then we
changed our Course southwards, and stood
South-east.</P>
<P>On the 29th, 30th, and 31th we sailed
South-east and by south all along by the Land,
the south side of the <HI>Foreland</HI> was 8 Leagues
from us, bearing North-east, then we sailed
South-west and by south, it was very cold with
<PB N="15" REF="140"/>
a North-west wind. We saw daily abundance
of <HI>Fin-fishes,</HI> but no more <HI>Whales.</HI></P>
<P>On the 9th of <HI>August</HI> it was windy all day,
with a gloomy Sun-shine in the forenoon; it
cleared up towards noon; the wind was South-east,
when we took the Meridian heighth of
the Sun, and were at 66 degrees 47 minutes;
we sailed South-westward all along the Nor∣thern
shoar of the Country.</P>
<P>On the 13th, being <HI>Sunday</HI> in the morning,
the wind was North-west, stormy, with rain
and west winds. In the night we had very
clear Moon and Star-light. In the morning
we saw the northern part of <HI>Hitland,</HI> we sailed
southward; after the rain we saw <HI>Fair-Isle,</HI> and
sailed in betwixt <HI>Hitland</HI> and <HI>Fair-Isle,</HI> first South-west,
and afterwards South-west and by south,
and then southward.</P>
<P>On the 20th it was fair weather, warm
Sun-shine, and somewhat windy. When the
day began to appear we saw <HI>Hilgeland,</HI> South-eastward
of us, when we sailed South-east;
there we took in a Pilot, on purpose chosen
by the Magistrates of <HI>Hamburg.</HI></P>
<P>On the 29th it was fair weather, and warm
Sun-shine all day; we sailed before the <HI>Elbe,</HI>

<HEAD>THE

OF THE
VOYAGE
TO
SPITSBERGEN:
CONTAINING
The Description of Spitzbergen.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the External Face and Appearance
of Spitsbergen.</HEAD>
<P>THE lowermost parts of these Coun∣tries
that are called <HI>Spitsbergen,</HI> from
the sharp and pointed Hills or Moun∣tains,
(for <HI>Spitz</HI> is pointed) are situated under
76 degrees and 30 minutes. We sailed to the
81th deg. and no Ship ventured farther that
<PB REF="142"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB REF="143"/>
<PB N="17" REF="143"/>
year; but how far this Country is extended to
the North, is still unknown.</P>
<P>It seemeth, because the Ice stands firm, and
floats not, as that in the Sea doth, that there
should be land not far behind it.</P>
<P>As the highest Countries are surrounded with
Mountains, as a Fortification is with Walls and
Works, so are these Countries naturally sur∣rounded
with high Hills.</P>
<P>The inward Condition of this Country
we do not know, but it seemeth, since we see
one Hill behind another, that it is so throughout
the whole Country.</P>
<P>At the <HI>Muscle-Haven,</HI> or <HI>Muscle-Bay,</HI> we find
plainer and leveller Ground; and the farther
we sail toward the East, the Ground groweth
the lower, yet it is all stony, and with pro∣spects
of smaller Hills; it doth not look at all
as if it could be inhabited by Men.</P>
<P>I believe also that the Land there must of
necessity be lower and lower; for else we should
see it higher above the other, as we do the other
Mountains.</P>
<P>Concerning the Beasts that live on this Land,
I believe they come over the Ice in the Spring,
when the Ice stands firm, into these Countries,
and that the same way they go away from
thence again, when the long nights begin.</P>
<P>Concerning the Birds, we have partly a
good account of them, their places and food
is known, as I shall mention when I come to
write of them.</P>
<P>When on the 18th of <HI>June,</HI> on a <HI>Sunday</HI> in
the forenoon, we first came to the Foreland of
<HI>Spitzbergen;</HI> the foot of these Mountains look∣ed
like fire, and the tops of them were cover∣with
foggs; the snow was marbel'd, and look'd
<PB N="18" REF="144"/>
as if it were boughs of branches of Trees, and
gave as bright and glorious a shining of gloss to
the Air or Skies, as if the Sun had shin'd.</P>
<P>When the Mountains look thus fiery, a hard
storm generally ensues.</P>
<P>These Countries are in the Winter encom∣passed
with Ice from divers places, according
as the winds blow; as if it be East from <HI>Nova
Zembla,</HI> if North-west form <HI>Greenland,</HI> and the
Island of <HI>John Mayen:</HI> it also happeneth some∣times
that the Land is begirt with Ice in the
Summer, as they have often seen, that go thither
every year.</P>
<P>But when the Ice comes floating on too
hard, or in too great a quantity, then the Ships
make to the Harbours, Havens, Bays or Ri∣vers,
as they call them, that run up into the
Country; the wind useth to receive us some∣thing
unkindly, when we sail into them, roar∣ing
over the dry Hills with small Whirl-winds.
The water in these Rivers is salt.</P>
<P>We meet here with no fresh Streams or Ri∣volets;
nor did I ever see a Spring there.</P>
<P>Of some Rivers we know their beginning,
of others it cannot found out, because of
the danger of the Ice, which they are never
free from; some because of the hidden Rocks
underneath the water, which are discovered
by the vehement breaking of the Sea, or by
great quantity of white foam.</P>
<P>The Names of the Havens you find all in
order one after another in the Map of <HI>Spitz∣bergen,</HI>
as far as we have been.</P>
<P>These Havens they reckon to be the safest,
<HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Safe-Harbour,</HI> and the <HI>South</HI> and <HI>North-Bay,</HI>
which are the most known of any in
<HI>Spitzbergen.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="144"/>
The other Havens, of what names soever,
we commonly sail by, because they lye open
to the Sea.</P>
<P>Others we pass by because of the constant
Ice that is in them, and the hidden Rocks.</P>
<P>In the <HI>South</HI> or <HI>North-Haven</HI> or <HI>Bay,</HI> ride com∣monly
the most Ships; I told several times ten,
twenty, nay thirty Ships, that lay at Anchor,
as your may see in the Plates <HI>C</HI> and <HI>D,</HI> marked
with <HI>c</HI> and <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning the Birds, we see abundance
more of them by and on the Land, then a∣mong
the Ice, chiefly when they hatch their
Eggs; we do not find they make their Nest up
with far-fetcht things, neither do they gather
any thing for them from <HI>Norway, Schetland,</HI> or
the like.</P>
<P>The Seeds of several Herbs might grow in
<HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> but the Herbs nature hath bestow∣ed
on those Countries are such as are fit for
the Diseases and Distempers that are common
there.</P>
<P>We saw abundance of <HI>Sea-horses</HI> by <HI>Spitz∣bergen,</HI>
on the low Land, and upon the Ice;
but we saw but very few <HI>Seales</HI> on the Ice there∣about.</P>
<P>The Country (as is aforesaid) is stony, and
quite throughout it are high Mountains and
Rocks.</P>
<P>Below, at the feet of the Mountains, stand
the Hills of Ice very high, and reach to the
tops of the Mountains; the Cliffs are filled up
with Snow; wherefore these Snow-Mountains
show very strange to those that never saw them
before, they appear like dry Trees with Bran∣ches
and Twigs, and when the Snow falleth
upon them they get Leaves as it were, which
<PB N="20" REF="145"/>
soon after melt, and others come in the room
of them.</P>
<P>There are seven large Ice-Mountains in a
Line in these Countries, that lye between the
high Rocks, which look of a glorious blew co∣lour,
as also is the Ice, with a great many
cracks and Holes in them; they are hollowed
out, melted away, and cut in Groves by the
rain and snow-water that runs down; they are
increased greatly by the Snow, as the other Ice
that swimmeth in the Sea is also: they are aug∣mented
likewise by the melted Snow from the
Rocks, and from the Rain that falls on them.</P>
<P>These seven Mountains of Ice are esteemed
to be the highest in the Country; indeed they
shewed very high as we sailed by them, under∣neath:
the Snow look'd dark from the shades
of the Skies, which shewed very neat and cu∣rious,
with the blew cracks where the Ice was
broken off.</P>
<P>About the middle of the Mountains some
foggy Clouds hovered over; above these the
Snow was very bright.</P>
<P>The true Rocks look't fiery, and the Sun
shin'd pale upon them, the Snow giving the
Air a bright reflection. They were covered
with Clouds, so that you could scarce see the
tops of them.</P>
<P>Some of these Rocks are but one stone from
the bottom to the top, appearing like an old
decayed Wall; they smell very sweet, as the
green Fields do in our Country in the Spring
when it rains. See <HI>c c</HI> in the Plate <HI>C.</HI></P>
<P>The stones for the most part are vein'd dif∣ferently,
like Marble, with red, white, and
yellow: at the alteration of the weather the
stones sweat, and by that means the Snow is
<PB N="21" REF="145"/>
stained or coloured; and also if it raineth much,
the water runs down by the Rocks, and from
thence the Snow is tinged red.</P>
<P>On the foot of the Mountains, where no
mounts of Ice stand, lye great loose Rocks, as
they chance to be fall'n one upon the other,
with Caves and Holes, so that it is very ticklish
walking upon them; both great and small
Stones or Rocks are mixt together: these stones
are of a grey colour, or grey with black veins,
they glister like Silver-oar. Most of the Rocks
that are at the bottom of the Mounts are like
the Pebles we pave our Streets withal. On these
Rocks grow all sorts of Herbs, Graves, and
Moss very plentifully; they grow up in the
two Months of <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July,</HI> from the seed to
bear seed again. Look <HI>f</HI> in the Plate <HI>C.</HI></P>
<P>The Herbs grow thickest where that water
runs of falls down from the Hills, (and also
where they are defended from the North and
East winds) from whence always some Dust
or Moss is carried down with it, which after
a long time becomes Earth (yet it is rather
dung than a true earth) and the Birds do con∣tribute
by their dung towards it.</P>
<P>These Mountains seem as if they were Earth
at top by reason of the height, but when you
are at the top of them, they are Rock as well
at the top as the bottom, which we also see,
when great pieces of them fall down. If stones
are flung down from these Mountains, it sounds
as if it thundred with an Echo and Rattling
in the Valleys, as if very great pieces were
thrown off from the top of them.</P>
<P>The Mountains also are full of cracks wherein
the Birds make their Nests; they all fly down
from the Mountains to seek their food in the
<PB N="22" REF="146"/>
water; some eat the Carrion of Fishes, others
eat small Fishes and Shrimps, as I shall say, when
I treat of the Birds.</P>
<P>There are also White-Bears, Deer and Foxes
in these Countries. The Bear liveth upon dead
Whales or dead Men; the Fox feeds upon Birds
and their Eggs; and the Deer eat the Herbs.</P>
<P>One may conjecture at the height of these
Mountains by this, when ths Skies are not very
clear, the Mountains stand, to about the middle,
in the Clouds; some of them look as if they
were a coming down every moment, as in the
Plate <HI>D</HI> at <HI>f.</HI></P>
<P>The reason why the lowermost Hills do not
seem so high, is because so very great ones stand
near them. A Ship with its Masts and Rig∣ging,
in no more to be compared with these
Mountains, than a small House with a high
Steeple. The Miles seem also to be very short,
but when you go to walk them upon the Land,
you find it quite another thing, and you will
soon be tired; and also because of the rough∣ness
and sharpness of the Rocks, and for want
of a path, you will soon get warm be it ne∣ver
so cold: a new pair of Shoes will not last
one long here.</P>
<P>We went in the night, when it was a very
clear Sun-shine, upon one of the Rocks near
the <HI>English</HI> Haven, about a Mile long, to look
after a <HI>Whale</HI> that had got away from us; in
the middle of this Harbour others were a row∣ing
in their Long-Boats, which we could hard∣ly
discern: a great part fell down from one of
these Mountains, which sounded very loud.
The Mountains look'd black, strip'd with veins
of Snow. I was so calm that we could hardly
perceive any breeze of wind, and not very
<PB REF="146"/>
<PB REF="147"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB REF="148"/>
<PB N="23" REF="148"/>
cold. The shoar was very full of <HI>Sea-horses,</HI> which
roared so that we could hear them a great way
off, as if some Bulls had bellowed.</P>
<P>In the Country we travel thus; We take
along with us two or more Guns and Lances,
to resist the Highway-men the Bears, but one
is soon tired, as I said before, because of the
stones and the loose Ice, whereon it is very
troublesome to walk.</P>
<P>As many as I have seen of these Mountains
are situated thus; The highest are from the
<HI>Foreland</HI> to the <HI>Muscle-Haven</HI> (or <HI>Muscle Bay:</HI>)
after the <HI>Foreland</HI> follow the seven Ice Mounts,
which are very high Mountains; and they are
called so from the Ice-Hills that fill up the Val∣leys,
of lye between the Rocks. These moun∣tainous
Rocks are not so sharp or pointed at the
top as the two foremost Rocks at the <HI>Haven</HI> of
<HI>Magdalen</HI> are. Then cometh the <HI>Haven</HI> of
the <HI>Hamburgers, Magdalen,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> and
<HI>Danish</HI> Harbour, and at last the <HI>South-Haven.</HI>
At the <HI>Magdalen-Haven</HI> the Rocks lye in a
round of semi-circle, at each side by one ano∣ther,
stand two high Mountains that are hol∣low
within, as if they were dug out: after the
fashion of a Breast-work, with points and
cracks at the top, like Battlements; at the bot∣tom
within the Hill, stands a Snow-hill that
doth reach to the very top of the Mountain,
like a Tree with branches and twigs; the other
Rocks look rudely.</P>
<P>In this <HI>South<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Haven</HI> the Ships ride at Anchor
between high Mountains; on the left as we
sail into it, is a Hill called the <HI>Beehive</HI> in the
Cut <HI>C</HI> and <HI>D,</HI> marked with <HI>g;</HI> called so from
its resemblance of a <HI>Beehive:</HI> close to it lieth a
large and high Mount, called the <HI>Devils Huck,</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="149"/>
commonly covered with a fogg, and if the wind
bloweth over it, it darkneth the Haven, and
seemeth as if it smoaked, filling the Haven
therewith; on the top thereof are three
small white Hills covered with Snow, in the
Cut <HI>C</HI> and <HI>D,</HI> marked with <HI>h;</HI> two of them
stand near to one another. In the middle of
this Harbour is an Island in the Cut <HI>C</HI> marked
with <HI>i,</HI> which is called the <HI>Dead-man's Island,</HI>
because they bury the dead men there after this
manner; They are put into a Coffin, and co∣vered
with a heap of large stones, and not∣withstanding
all this, they are sometimes eaten
by the white Bears.</P>
<P>I have seen no other sort of Ground but
great stones at <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> so that the frost can∣not
penetrate far into such Ground. I admi∣red
that the Snow was at that time all melted
away, and in the Cliffs between the great
Rocks was no more Snow to be seen, although
the holes were very deep. I fancy that abun∣dance
of rain had fallen in the Spring, and that
the weather had been tolerable, or else we must
have seen more Snow there.</P>
<P>There are also more small Islands here and
there in this Harbour, that have no particular
names, but are called <HI>Birds Islands,</HI> because we
gather thereupon the Eggs of Mountain <HI>Ducks</HI>
and <HI>Kirm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ums.</HI></P>
<P>Then you come to <HI>Schmeremburg,</HI> so named
from <HI>Schmer,</HI> which signifieth grease; there
are still Houses standing, formerly built by the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> where they used to boil their Train-Oil.
Some <HI>Dutchmen</HI> once attempted to stay there
all the Winter, but they all perisht: in the Cut
<HI>C</HI> it is marked with <HI>k.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="149"/>
It is observable that a dead Carkase doth not
easily rot or consume; for it has been found,
that a man buried ten years before, still re∣mained
in his perfect shape and dress; and they
could see by the Cross that was stuck upon his
Grave, how long he had been buried.</P>
<P>These Houses are now from year to year
destroyed and burnt.</P>
<P>This year were yet standing several Houses,
like a little Village, some where of were then
burnt.</P>
<P>Over-against <HI>Schmerenburg</HI> were also several
Houses standing, and a Kettle or Boyler; they
call that place the <HI>Cookery of Harlem.</HI> This year
four Houses remained, whereof two were
Ware-houses, in the others they dwelt. They
are built after this fashion, not very large; there
is a Stove before with a Ceiling at top, and
behind a Chamber taking in the whole breadth
of the House: the Ware-houses are something
larger; therein were still several Barrels or
Kardels that were quite decayed, the Ice stand∣ing
in the same shape the Vessels had been of.
An Anvile, Smith's Tongs, and other Tools
belonging to the <HI>Cookery,</HI> were frozen up in the
Ice. The kettle was still standing as it was
set, and the wooden Troughs stood by it.
From thence you may go to the <HI>English Haven;</HI>
on the other side is the place where the dead
are buried; this is something even, like earth,
but it is levelled on purpose. Behind these
Houses are high Mountains; if one climbeth
upon these, as we do on others, and doth not
mark every step with Chalk, one doth not
know how to get down again. When you go
up, you think it to be very easie to be done;
but when you are to descend, it is very difficult
<PB N="26" REF="150"/>
and dangerous, so that many have fallen and
lost their lives.</P>
<P>The River there is called the <HI>South Harbour,</HI>
or <HI>Bay;</HI> and if the Ships suffer any damage at
Sea, they refit there.</P>
<P>At the entry into the <HI>South Harbour,</HI> in the
Valley between the Mountains, is collected
great quantities of fresh Water from the Snow
and Rain, upon the shoar stand abundance of
Kardels or Barrels; we used this Water for our
Victuals, and other occasions: it is also found
in the Clifts of the Icy-hills on shoar; but true
Springs out of the Ground I never saw in <HI>Spitz∣bergen.</HI></P>
<P>The shoar there is not very high, but the
water is deep, there was no Ice at all to be seen
in it, from whence I conclude that it had not
been a severe Winter; for it is impossible that
the Ice could have been melted in so short a
time, not only here, but also in the <HI>English Ha∣ven</HI>
or <HI>Bay,</HI> where the Ice stood firm still, and
hardly lay above half a Fathom under wa∣ter.</P>
<P>The Ice doth melt much sooner in Salt-water
than in fresh River-water, but yet it is
impossible that so thick Ice could have melted
in so short a time. We saw also that the Snow
melted on the tops of the high Rocks, and the
water ran down, although it was there much
colder then below; yet above and below it
melted alike: differently from what I observed
since in <HI>Spain</HI> in the Month of <HI>December</HI> 1672.
the wind being North-west, when the Rain
fell below about a quarter of a League, yet
above it the Mountains were all covered with
Snow, all in the streight Line, one not higher
than the other, as if they had been levell'd.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="150"/>
In the <HI>Northern Haven</HI> or <HI>Bay,</HI> lyeth a very
large Mountain, flat at top; this Island is cal∣led
the <HI>Birds Song,</HI> from the great number of
them that build and hatch there; for when
they fly up, they make so great a noise, that
one can hardly hear his own words: This is
marked with <HI>b</HI> in the Cut <HI>D.</HI></P>
<P>Beside these there are more <HI>Islands</HI> named in
the Map, as the <HI>Clifted Rock,</HI> and such other.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rehenfeld</HI> is a low Land, and it is cal∣led
so from the Deer commonly seen there.</P>
<P>I was informed that it is all Slats, that stand
up edgewise, so that it is very troublesome to
go on, it is all over-grown with Moss. There
is a Hill upon it that looketh like fire.</P>
<P>Behind the <HI>Rehenfeld</HI> are high Mountains
again, they are not pointed at top, they lye
as it were in a Line; by the <HI>Rehenfeld</HI> runs up a
River into the Country, and is called the
<HI>Halfmoon-Bay,</HI> from its shape. On the other
side of the River is a Mountain, flat at the top,
and full of cracks all filled up with Snow. Then
cometh the <HI>Liefde-Bay (Bay</HI> of <HI>Love)</HI> where
two Hills stand together very like unto
<HI>Spitzbergen</HI> at <HI>Magdalens Bay,</HI> and those two
Harbours are very much like one another.</P>
<P>Then we come to lower Ground behind the
<HI>Muscle Harbour,</HI> where the Grass was so high,
that it covered our ankles, as far as we went.</P>
<P>Next is the <HI>Weihgatt,</HI> or the <HI>Straights of Hindelo∣pen.</HI>
The <HI>Weihgatt</HI> is called so from the Winds, (for
<HI>weihen</HI> signifieth blowing) because a very strong
South-wind bloweth out of it. On the <HI>Bear-Haven,</HI>
upon the Land, are all red stones.</P>
<P>Behind the <HI>Weihg att</HI> followeth the<HI>South-west
Land,</HI> which is also low; it seemeth as if it was
adorned with small Hills: then follow the seven
<HI>Islands</HI> which we could see.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="151"/>
We saw no Ships go any farther, neither
could I understand that ever any Ships did go
farther, nor can they go so far every year to∣wards
the East, because of the danger of the
Ice that swimmeth, and is brought from thence
by the wind and stream.</P>
<P>In <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June</HI> is the best fishing in the Ice
between the <HI>Island</HI> of <HI>John Mayen</HI> and <HI>Spitz∣bergen.</HI>
In <HI>July</HI> and <HI>August</HI> the <HI>Whales</HI> run
Eastward by <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> we saw at the latter
end many <HI>Whales</HI> that run to the <HI>Weigatt.</HI> It
is unknown whether the Haven of this <HI>Wei∣gatt</HI>
goeth through the Country, or no. But
this is not that <HI>Weigatt</HI> whereof so many things
are written.</P>
<P>More I do not knwo of this Country. Rocks
and Snow and Ice-hills we find in abundance
there, and the Creatures that live upon them,
I shall describe hereafter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the SEA.</HEAD>
<P>THE Waves begin to raise themselves at
first from a small breeze of wind, and by
the increase and continuance of the breeze they
grow longer, higher and bigger.</P>
<P>The Sea is not immediately made rough in
the beginning of high winds, but the Waves
swell by degrees and slowly, until they come
to be as bigg as Mountains; then they expand
and break themselves, and fall over with dash∣ing
and foaming, as you may see by <HI>k</HI> in the
Cut <HI>D</HI></P>
<P>Then the following Wave from behind rais∣ith
it again, with much curled and foaming
Scum, neatly spotted with the white Foam,
looking like Marble. This breaking and foam∣ing
of the Waves is successively repeated.</P>
<P>So the swelling Waves continually follow one
another, moving before the wind with a quick
motion, but when these Waves are short, they
dash over the Ship, and break much, so that the
Ship is hardly able to live.</P>
<P>In stormy weather little Waves curle on the
top of the great ones, and lesser again upon
them.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="152"/>
The Ships do not feel these smaller Waves but
only the great ones, that are called Sea-Moun∣tains,
which heave and mount the Ship with
them, but nevertheless she always keeps her
strait way through these unpathed Waves, which
is wonderful to behold.</P>
<P>In a hard storm the froth of the Sea drives
like dust, and looketh as when the wind driveth
the Snow along upon the Ice, or as the Dust of
the Earth does in dry weather, and you see the
Sea every where to look like curled Ice, that
when it is a freezing is hindred from it by the
wind, all covered with a white foam, and one
Wave blows over the precedent, with a great
roaring and noise, as if a Water-mill were a
going; and this same noise the Ships make
likewise when they cut through the Sea.</P>
<P>It is also to be observed, that the Waves dash
against one another when the wind changeth,
and cross over through one another, with
great dashing over the Ships, before they move
all one and the same way.</P>
<P>I did not observe here the Seawater so clear,
nor found it so salt as near the Ice; it may be
by reason of the shallow ground or bottom,
and the many fresh Rivers that run into it; or
because the Frost cleareth the water more.</P>
<P>Concerning the manner of their Sailing; they
sail and change their Ways and Sails according
as they think fit. If there be a fresh Gale, they
make use of all their Sails; if a storm, with the
two lowermost Sails, whereof they call the first
the <HI>Fock</HI> or <HI>Fore-sail,</HI> the middlemost <HI>Schumfer</HI> or
<HI>Main-sail,</HI> and the third the <HI>Basan</HI> or <HI>Mizen-sail.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="152"/>
In hard storms they furl the fore Sail, and
sail only with the Main-Sail and the <HI>Mizen-sail.</HI></P>
<P>In the greatest storm of all, with these Sails
reefed or half tied in, as they call it, or with
the Mizen-sail half furled up; this they do
because the Ship goeth the stedier by reason
of the wind, for else it would rowle too much
up and down in the Sea, and the water would
dash in too much on the sides thereof.</P>
<P>One man stands always at the Helm to steer
the Ship, but in hard weather ten men can
hardly hold the Helm, wherefore they fasten
it with a Tackle, and so let it go too and fro,
as the Compass directs them.</P>
<P>In and after a storm we have oftentimes
strangers come to visit us in our Ships, <HI>viz.
Blackbirds, Starlings,</HI> and all sorts of small Birds,
that have lost their way in a storm from the and,
and fly to the Ships to save themselves, and
prolong their lives, when others fly about till
they are spent, and then fall into the Sea, and
are drowned.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lumbs,</HI> and other Water-fowl, come not
near us; which I mention on purpose to con∣fute
the erroneons Opinion of some, that be∣lieve
that the before-mentioned Birds come to
the Ships as Messengers, to bring the ill news
of bad weather.</P>
<P>Yet notwithstanding, these following signs or
marks commonly fore-tell a storm or hard
weather, when great fish come near to the
Ships in great numbers, when they play, dance,
rowl about, and leap out of the water, which
is not always playing in them, but rather their
Bodies are afflicted with some pain or other.
We saw several <HI>Whales</HI> in the Sea, that threw
<PB N="32" REF="153"/>
themselves about as if they were sick, or a
dying.</P>
<P>When the Sea is tempestuous, it is not to
be thought that it doth proceed from the Sea
only, but a hard and tempestuous storm and
wind followeth upon it, that sendeth the Waves
like Messengers before it, until it arriveth it
self with a tempest; but this is not to be un∣derstood
of the North-sea, but only of the
Sea betwixt <HI>Hitland</HI> and <HI>Spitzbergen.</HI></P>
<P>When the Air is so disposed, as the Stars do
not only look bigger, but as if they were more
in number also, it is a great Prognostication,
and often proveth true also; It is a sign that
the Air is full of Mist, which causeth upon
changing of the Frost, great foggs, and a high
wind follows soon after.</P>
<P>At night, when the Sea dasheth very much,
it shines like fire, the Sea-men call it burning:
This shining is a very bright glance, like unto
the lustre of a Diamond.</P>
<P>But when the Sea shines vehemently in a
dark night, and burns; a South or West-wind
followeth after it.</P>
<P>At the stern of the Ship, where the water is
cut through, you see at night deep under
water, bubbles rise and break, then this shining
or lustre is not there.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have discoursed of the North-sea,
but next of the Waves between <HI>Hitland</HI> and
<HI>Spitzbergen;</HI> near <HI>Hitland</HI> the stream runneth
very swift toward the North, and it grows daily
colder.</P>
<P>It is to be observed, that here the Waves of
the Sea run longer, almost as they do before
the narrow Channel between <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>France</HI> in the <HI>Spanish Sea,</HI> (and what hath been
<PB N="33" REF="153"/>
observed heretofore of the rowling and tos∣sing
of the Sea belongeth properly to this)
with a continual tossing of the Ships, which
maketh the men Sea-sick.</P>
<P>The vomiting and sickness is attributed to
the Sea-water; but it really proceedeth from
the great and continual motion of the Body,
when oftentimes we are forced to creep on all
four.</P>
<P>Neither Meat nor Drink tasts well, the head
akes and is giddy, and they are always reach∣ing
to vomit. Costiveness of the Body doth
generally accompany this Distemper, and the
Urine is highly tinged. I reckon it no more
then if one is not used to ride in Coaches or
Waggons; only that it is always accompanied
with a bad stomach and restlesness.</P>
<P>The best Remedies for this Distemper, I
believe, are Aromaticks chewed in ones mouth,
as Cinamon, Cloves, Galengal, Ginger, Nut∣megs,
and the like. Many think to drive this
Distemper away with fasting, but they will
find themselves mistaken. Some drink Sea-water,
and believe that will make them vo∣mit,
which notwithstanding is not occasioned
by the Sea-water, but by the loathsomness there∣of.</P>
<P>To take away the ill taste out of ones
mouth, in my opinion, the best means is to
eat and drink plentifully, it easeth quickly;
neither ought one to sleep too much, but keep
in the Air, and look into the Wind, and to
walk up and down in the Ship, is also very
proper.</P>
<P>But now let us return to the Waves again,
they rise, although it be not windy, as high
as Mountains, very smooth, and run away as
<PB N="34" REF="154"/>
far as one can discern them, which is to be
understood when the Sea is turbulent, where∣upon
quickly a hard Gale of wind followeth.
In a storm the Waves run after the same man∣ner,
as is just now said, but with many curl∣ing
and foaming whirls, as is described in the
storm of the North-sea. These Waves run a
great way, so that you may see between them
at a great distance.</P>
<P>If any Ships be in your Company, often∣times
you cannot see them.</P>
<P>There Waves are a great deal larger then in
the North-sea, and have also greater power
when they fall over, but do not dash so easily
over the Ships as they do in the North-sea.
The Waves in the North-sea are presently lay'd
after a storm, but the commotion of these last∣eth
often to the third day; if it be never so
calm, the Ships are moved very violently,
that you cannot walk, sit, or lie; it is best
to keep in the middle of the Ship, for before
and behind the Sea beats hard against them.
The Sails are driven against the Masts, and
have no steadiness from the wind. If in a brisk
Gale of a full wind the Sails are all full and
round, the Ship sails best upon the Sea.</P>
<P>There is as great difference in Ships, as to
sailing, as there is in Horses, concerning
easiness and swiftness; the motion of the
Ships is therefore different; the stilness
and quietness, when nothing is tumbled up
and down in the Ship, furthereth also sailing
very much.</P>
<P>The Ships swim something higher in the
Sea then they do in Fresh-water; for there is
almost a foot difference in a ship with the same
loading. 'Tis generally agreed upon, that one
<PB N="35" REF="154"/>
may see a Ship in a calm Sea three, or three
and a half <HI>German</HI> Miles off, and beyond that
distance the Sea loseth it self in the Air, and
the Air in the Sea. If a Ship saileth on the
main Sea at one and half <HI>German</HI> Miles di∣stance,
you have lost the sight of half the
Ship; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t two Miles you see only the upper∣most
Mast, at three Miles distance you see
only the Flagg, and when it goeth farther, you
have quite lost it.</P>
<P>Land and Mountains may be seen at a great
distance at Sea; we saw <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> at twelve
Miles distance off at Sea; the Country looked
like a black Cloud full of white stroaks, as is in
the Cut <HI>D</HI> marked with<HI>a, b, c, g, h, i.</HI> Near
the Ice of this Sea it is coldest where the Waves
are quiet; and the Sea-water is so clear, that
at twelve and more Fathoms deep you may
see the bottom. There is no ground to be
found near the Ice to drop an Anchor.</P>
<P>It is also to be observed, that according
to the colour of the Skies, the colour of
the Sea is changed. If the Skies be clear,
the sea looks as blew as a Saphir; if it
is covered somewhat with Clouds, the Sea
is as green as an Emerald; if there be a fog∣gy
Sun-shine, it looketh yellow; if it be
quite dark, like unto the colour of <HI>Indico;</HI> in
stormy and cloudy weather, like black Sope,
or exactly like unto the colour of black Lead.</P>
<P>If the wind be quite calm, one may hear
beating or knocking at a great distance on the
the Sea, by which we also observe the <HI>Whale</HI>
hears, as shall be mentioned in its proper
place.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="155"/>
Among the Ice the stream runs South∣wards,
which we observed by our driving
back a great way. At the <HI>Muscle-Haven</HI> the
stream ran Northwards. Those that sail year∣ly
to those places, cannot give any certain in∣formation
concerning ebbing and flowing;
only they have observed the water to be high∣er
about the Land, when the winds have
been higher then at other times. And this I
have also observed, that if there was an or∣derly
or continual ebbing and flowing, the
Eggs of the Birds would be drowned upon
the Islands.</P>
<P>Certain information, concerning ebbing
and flowing, is not easily to be had, I know
no more of it then what I have writ∣ten.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the ICE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Months of <HI>April</HI> and <HI>May</HI> the west
Ice breaks, because it lyeth Westward,
which drives dispersed in the Sea, by the
Island of <HI>John Mayen,</HI> and reacheth to <HI>Spitz∣bergen,</HI>
where at that time it was firm still, as
you may see in the Plate <HI>A</HI> marked with <HI>e.</HI></P>
<P>The difference between the Ice of <HI>Spitz∣bergen,</HI>
and that of our Country, is, that it is
not smooth there, so as to slide upon it.</P>
<P>Neither is it so clear nor transparent, nor
so sharp and cutting, but a great deal harder,
and is not easily broke or split; but it looketh
likest unto the Ground-Ice of the Rivers in our
Country, or like unto Loaf-sugar.</P>
<P>Where the Ice is fixed upon the Sea, you
see a snow-white brightess in the Skies, as if
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Sun shined, for the Snow is reflected by
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Air, just as a Fire by Night is; but at a
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istance you see the Air blew or blackish:
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here there is many small Ice-fields; that are
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Meadows for the<HI>Seales,</HI> you see no lustre
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> brightness of the Skies.</P>
<P>The Sea dasheth against these Ice-fields,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich occasioneth several fine Figure; not
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they are naturally framed so, but just as
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> flowers on our Glass-windows, get all
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of figures; for these are framed by the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shing of the Sea, like unto Mountains, Stee∣ples,
<PB N="38" REF="156"/>
Tables, Chappels, and all sort of Beasts.</P>
<P>These Ice-fields are a great deal deeper un∣der
water, then they are high above it, and
are of a paler colour under water then above;
the top of them might be called the Kernel
and Marrow of the Ice, because the colour is
much deeper then that of the other.</P>
<P>The highest colour is delicate blew, of the
same colour with the blewest Vitriol, somewhat
more transparent, yet not so clear as that in
our Country, which you may see through, let
it be never so thick; it is as hard as a stone, and
it is not easily split or cleav'd, because it is
spumgy, like unto a Punice stone. Among
this Ice the Ships sail up and down, until they
come to bigger Ice fields, for the small ones
incumber the Sea, that the Ships sail often a∣gainst
them and perish; for when the winds
arise the Waves drive against the Ice-fields, as
if it was against Rocks, and beat the Ships to
pieces.</P>
<P>When we are passed by these small Ice-fields
that swim at a great distance from one
another, then we sail in between them, and
draw a small Ice-field behind the stern of our
Ship, that it may be the sooner stopt, and
kept from swift sailing, without letting the
Sails strike, for else it might easily run against
an Ice-field. Every Ships Master is left to his
free-will, whether he will sail into the Ice, be∣cause
in the Spring the <HI>Whales</HI> are in great
numbers seen there in the <HI>West-Ice,</HI> as they call
it.</P>
<P>The Masters do not willingly sail in a∣mongst
the Ice, when it is dark, or foggy, or
stormy, which must be expected in the Spring,
and the small sheets of Ice swim up and down
<PB N="39" REF="156"/>
in the Sea, which the Skippers must avoid,
lest they lose their Ships.</P>
<P>It may seem something strange, that they
sail so often to the Ice and back again but there
is the same reason for it as is in hunting after
Deer, if we do not find Whales in one place,
we must seek them in others; for the fortune
in ketching of <HI>Whales</HI> is like the Chances of
Gaming, and there is no great understanding
required to find them: some see and catch
more then they desire, and others but at half
a mile distant from them, see not one, which is
very common.</P>
<P>When they go in amongst the Ice, the
men stand ready with great Ice-hooks to keep
them off, that the Ship may not run against
them.</P>
<P>The farther you sail into, and amongst the
Ice, the greater Ice-fields you shall foe, so that
you cannot look over them; for about the
West, as they call it, are larger Ice-fields to be
seen then about <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> quite white at the
top, covered with Snow, so that there is but
ill walking upon them, because you fall deep
into the Snow. (See <HI>A</HI> marked with <HI>l,</HI> and
<HI>B</HI> marked <HI>c.</HI>)</P>
<P>The prints of the <HI>Bears</HI> footing we saw on
the shoar of the Ice-fields, for they seek their
Prey in the water, which is the dead Carkases
of the <HI>Whales,</HI> the <HI>Foxes</HI> generally accompany
them, for their choicer food of Birds is here
scarcer then at <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> for they flock not
together, but fly singly.</P>
<P>When they sail some Miles into the Ice,
where there is pretty large Ice-fields, they joyn
their Ships to them with great Ice-hooks, fast∣ned
to strong Cables, where they lie at An∣chor,
<PB N="40" REF="157"/>
several Ships about the same Ice-field,
but they rather chose to be alone, because they
are an hindrance to one another in <HI>Whale</HI>-catching,
and the hunting of them from one
to another maketh them shie.</P>
<P>Amongst the Ice we find no great Waves,
but it is pretty smooth, even when it is some∣what
stormy. All the danger is from one Ice-field
being bigger then the other, and the
little ones swiming faster then the great ones,
which often causeth a stoppage, so that they
crowd upon one another, not without great
danger of the Ships, which are often catcht
between, and broken by them. See the Plate <HI>B</HI>
at <HI>a.</HI></P>
<P>The Seamen hinder the pressing on of the
Ice as much as in them lieth, with great Ice-hooks;
but what small help this affordeth them
daily experience testifies sufficienty. In fair
weather the mischief is as soon done as in
tempestuous, because the Ice drives in the Sea
either with the stream or wind, as either of
them is the more prevalent, crashing and grind∣ing
against each other whence the danger arises
to the Ships, for after such a manner many
Ships perish. See Plate <HI>B.</HI></P>
<P>They say that a dead <HI>Whale</HI> tied to the Ship,
is the best defence against the Ice. Others
hang the Tails and Fins about their Ship, which
way is not to be rejected, for it is of great use
to them to prevent the danger of the squeez∣ing
of the Ice; they have examples, that in
such squeezing of the Ice a dead <HI>Whale</HI> hath
preserved them.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="157"/>
The Ice rises out of the Sea as high as a
Mountain; the striking of them together
makes so great a noise, that one can hardly
hear his own words; and from this joyning
together of the Ice, the great Ice-hills are
made, that drive up and down in the Sea.</P>
<P>Other great Ice fields are not so high as the
Ice hills, yet notwithstanding they are hard∣ly
ever quite plain, and without a Hill; you
see the Ice under water as deep as you can see.
It is all of a blew colour, but the deeper you
look the purer blew you see; which beautiful
colour changes with the Air, for if it be rainy
weather, this colour groweth paler. I also
have often seen the Ice underneath the water
very green, the occasion whereof was the
troubled Air, whence the Sea assumeth this
colour.</P>
<P>I wonder that upon the largest Ice-fields
no high Mountains are seen, as are seen where
the Ice grinds and dashes one against the o∣ther.</P>
<P>I am of opinion, that the Ice melts to∣wards
the bottoms, for one may see it spungy;
for else, if one would compute from the be∣ginning,
it must have reached the very
ground, even in the middle of the depth of
the sea.</P>
<P>I have seen in <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> white Ice that
was frozen quite curled, it look'd just like Su∣gar-candy,
was very hard and thick, and
swam even with the Seas surface. The Ships
are not always in this danger of sqeezing,
for often times there is little or no Ice to be
seen there, although you are a great way in
the place where it usually is; but as soon as a
wind arises, you would admire from whence
<PB N="42" REF="158"/>
so great a quantity of Ice should come in less
then an hours time.</P>
<P>At the greatest Ice-fields of all, Ships do not
always ride the safest; since by reason of the
bigness, and the motion of the Sea, these Ice-fields
break, not without danger.</P>
<P>When such Ice-fields break they part a∣sunder,
which causeth a Whirl-pool in the
Sea, where all the out-parts press to the Cen∣tre,
and by that means the pieces of the Ice-fields
raise themselves up, and dash and grind
against each other.</P>
<P>When we came to 71 degrees in the
Month of <HI>April</HI> we saw the first Ice, and so
we failed up and down by the Ice, until that
Month was spent, for so early in the year no
body dares venture himself into or amongst
the Ice, by reason of the stormy winds▪ and
some times the Ice is still fixed, and stands
firm, and therefore there is but a few <HI>Whales</HI>
seen, for underneath the Ice they cannot
breathe.</P>
<P>Into the Ice we sailed at 77 degrees and
24 minutes, and drove with that sheet of Ice
towards the South. In this Month, and also
in the following Month of <HI>May,</HI> are the most
<HI>Whales</HI> seen here, which run towards the East,
and we follow them all along by the Ice to
<HI>Spitzbergen.</HI></P>
<P>Near to the Land smaller Ice-fields are seen,
because the Ice cannot give way by reason
of the Land, which causeth greater grinding
and breaking, and upon that account smaller
Ice than is in the open Sea. Yet for all this,
some greater Ice-Mountains are seen there,
that stand firm on the shoar, and never melt
at bottom, but increase every year higher and
<PB N="43" REF="158"/>
higher, by reason of the Snow that falls on
them, and then Rains that freezes, and then
Snow again alternately; and after this manner
the Icy-hills increase yearly, and are never
melted by the heat of the Sun at the top.
These Ice-Mounts change their first colour in
time by the Air, by Rain and by the Clouds;
and the fairest blew that can be, is seen in
the cracks of these Ice-hills. From these same
Ice-hills, oftentimes break off great pieces,
that swin in the Sea, and is more compact
than the other Ice by far. I once saw one of
these pieces that was curiously workt and car∣ved,
as it were, by the Sea, like a Church with
arched Windows and Pillars, the Doors and
Windows hung full of Icikles, on the inside
thereof I saw the delicatest blew that can be
imagined; it was bigger than our Ship, and
somewhat higher than our stern, but how deep
it was under water, I cannot exactly tell.
Near unto the <HI>Muscle-Haven,</HI> a great Ice-hill
came driving towards our Ship, that was as
high as our Poop, and went so deep under
water, that it took up our Anchor, which lay
fifteen Fathoms deep. I have also seen several
others, and of other figures, <HI>viz.</HI> round and
foursquare Tables, with round and blew Pil∣lars
underneath, as in Plate <HI>B</HI> marked with <HI>f:</HI>
the Table was very smooth and plain at the
top, and white with the Snow; at the sides
hung down a great many Icikles close to one
another, like a fringed Table-cloth; I believe
that near forty men might have sat about it.
I have seen of these Tables with one foot, and
with two or three Pillars, and abundance of
<HI>Seales</HI> swam about it. The Dishes that furnisht
this Table, were a piece of Ice like an Horses
<PB N="44" REF="159"/>
head, and a Swan, I doubt they were but salt.
You must observe that this Ice becometh very
spungy by the dashing of the Sea, and from
thence grows salt, like Sea-water, and thence
also changeth its colour, <HI>viz.</HI> from the Sea
and Rain-water mixt with it; for you shall
commonly see the Water look blew or yellow,
if you walk under water, with your eyes open,
and look upwards.</P>
<P>The other Ice, as far as it is above water, is
of a taste like other Ice, but that below the
Sea salt like the Sea-water.</P>
<P>When we arrived at <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> the Ice at
<HI>Rehenfelt</HI> was as yet fixed, but a few days after∣wards
it was driven away by the winds.</P>
<P>The Ice begirts these Countries on all sides:
as the Wind sets either from the <HI>Island</HI> of <HI>John
Mayen, Old Greenland,</HI> and <HI>Nova Zembla.</HI> We
found at this time, that the Ice reached from
the other side of <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> and the Ships
sailed between the Ice and the Land, as if it
were in a River.</P>
<P>As soon as this Ice is drove thither by the
winds, the Ships must give way, or go into
the Harbour, until the Winds have blown
or driven the Ice away, or else they are lost;
but if there be other Ships that escape, the men
are saved.</P>
<P>On this Ice I did not see many <HI>Sea-hounds,</HI>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the AIR.</HEAD>
<P>THE Frost is unconstant in our Coun∣try
but it is not so in <HI>Spitzbergen.</HI> In
the Month of <HI>April,</HI> at 71 degrees, it was so
cold that we could hardly keep warmth with∣in
us. They say that in this Month, as also in
<HI>May,</HI> the hardest Frosts happen every year.</P>
<P>All the Rigging, by reason of its being wet,
is covered over with Ice, and stiff.</P>
<P>They do not send their Ships so soon as
they did a few years ago, and yet they come
time enough there, for if they arrive too
early, there is nothing for them to do, because
the Ice is not yet dissipated, and therefore
but few <HI>Whales</HI> to be seen.</P>
<P>In the two first Summer Months of <HI>Spitz∣bergen,</HI>
their Teeth chatter in their Heads com∣monly,
and the Appetite is greater than in any
other Countreys.</P>
<P>The Sun sets no more after the third day
of <HI>May,</HI> and we were about 71 degrees,
when we could see as well by night as by day.
I cannot say much of constancy of the wea∣ther
in these two first Months, for it chang∣ed
daily. They say also, if the Moon appears
cloudy and misty, with a streaky Sky, that
then there commonly follows a storm. Whe∣ther
the Moon doth prognosticate such storms,
I cannot tell, because we have observed, that
<PB N="46" REF="160"/>
after we have seen the Moon, in a clear Sky, the
Air has grown foggy, which happeneth of∣ten,
chiefly if the wind changes. When the
Hills show fiery, it is from Foggs, which af∣ter
spread themselves every where, and the
Cold encreaseth: These Foggs look blew, like
<HI>Indico,</HI> and black afar off, which upon chang∣ing
of the Weather are driven along by the
wind, so that in less than half an hour the Sea
is so covered with a thick Fogg, that you
can hardly see from one end of the Ship to the
other.</P>
<P>On the 14th of <HI>May</HI> the Air was bright
and clear, and yet very cold; we could see
the <HI>Whales</HI> farther off in the Sea, then usually
at this time: We could not distinguish the
Air from the Sea, for it shewed as if the
Ships danced in the Air like naked Trees or
P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es.</P>
<P>After the same manner <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> looks at
a distance like a Cloud; the Mountains are so
reflected by the Sea, that he that knows not
the Country very well, cannot easily discern
if from the Air; and so other Countries very
often appear. The other three Months, <HI>June,
July,</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> were very calm.</P>
<P>Concerning the Cold, it is much according
to the quality of the Winds; so North and East
winds cause very intense Frosts; so that one
can hardly keep alive, especially if the wind
blows hard.</P>
<P>West and South winds, when somewhat
constant, cause much Snow, and sometimes
Rain also, and moderate cold.</P>
<P>The other winds of the 32 according
to the Compass, whatever names they have,
are changed by the Clouds, so that sometimes
<PB N="47" REF="160"/>
when the wind was Southwest and by South
in one place, at a few Miles distance, there
blows quite another wind.</P>
<P>What heat the Sun oftentimes affords we
saw by our Eyes watering, and the tears that
ran continually down our Cheeks. Yet this
severe Cold is not always, as is already men∣tioned,
for if it were, how could any Herbs
grow there.</P>
<P>Neither is there every year a constancy of
winds or weather ruled by the Moon, but an
alteration, as is in other places, sometimes a
milder, and sometimes a severer Winter.</P>
<P>Skilful Ship masters and Harpooners, com∣mend
those years for <HI>Whale</HI> catching, that have
not many foggy and cloudy days.</P>
<P>Whether, according to the New and Full
Moons, the Spring-tydes happen, cannot be
known.</P>
<P>Such clear Skies as we have sometimes in a
Summers day, with pleasant curled Clouds, I
have not seen at <HI>Spitzbergen;</HI> but on the con∣trary,
several dark and foggy ones. Rising
Thunder-clouds I have not seen, nor ever
heard of any body that had seen them.</P>
<P>Above the Ice the Air appears white, from
whence we know where the firm or fixed Ice
lies, as I have before observed in the Chapter
of the Ice.</P>
<P>In the two last Summer Months, chiefly in
<HI>July,</HI> before the <HI>Weigatt,</HI> the Sun shin'd so
warm, that the Tarr of the Ship between the
Seames, where the wind could not come at it,
melted.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="161"/>
There is hardly any difference of Cold be∣tween
Night and day, yet at Night when the
Sun shineth, it seemeth to one that rightly
considereth it, as if it was only clear Moon∣light,
so that you may look upon the Sun, as
well as you can upon the Moon; so that
thereby one may distinguish Night and Day
from each other. Increase of Cold, and
changing of the Compass, we did not observe
as far as we went.</P>
<P>It is also to be observed, that the Frost doth
not let a dead Body be consumed easily in
the Ground, as is already observed, in the
Chapter of the Description of <HI>Spitzbergen.</HI></P>
<P>The second day of <HI>August,</HI> in our Voyage
homeward, we observed the Sun first to
set.</P>
<P>Concerning the Meteors generated in the
Air, I observed that the <HI>Rime</HI> fell down in the
shape of small Needles of Snow into the Sea,
and covered it as if it was sprinkled all over
with Dust: these small Needles increased more
and more, and lay as they fell cross one over
the other, and looked very like a Cobweb;
they are formed by the cold of the Air, and
increased to that degree, that the Sea seemed
covered by them, as with a Skin, or a tender
Ice, which had the taste of Fresh-water; as
also the Sea-water that is taken up into the
high Air is changed, and falleth down again
in sweet or fresh Rain.</P>
<P>This hapneth in clear Sun-shine and intense
cold weather, and it falleth down as the Dew
doth with us at Night invisibly, in dull wea∣ther;
when the Sun doth not shine, you can∣not
see this; but you see it plainly, if you look
when the Sun shines towards a shady place;
<PB N="49" REF="161"/>
for then it sparkles as bright as Diamonds;
shews like the Atoms in Sun-shine, all day
long it falleth in so small Particles, that no∣thing
sticks or hangs on your Cloaths of it to
make them wet.</P>
<P>At Noon when the Sun shines very warm,
these small Needles melt in the Air, and fall
down insensibly like Dew.</P>
<P>Sometimes we see in our Country, some∣thing
a little like these small Needles, which
is what we call Rime, and falleth from the
Trees in Atoms like Dust. This is small Snow,
and may be seen as well in the Shade as in the
Sun. These Needles ar not the Exhalation
or Vapour that uses in cold Weather, to stick
to the Hair of Men and Beasts. I must not
forget, that we see in these falling Needles a
Bow like a Rain-bow of two colours, white
and a pale yellow, like the Sun, reflected by
the dark Shadows of the Clouds.</P>
<P>After this I proceed to the Description of
an other Bow, which I call a Sea-bow. This
is seen when the Sun shines clear and bright,
not in the great Waves, but in the Atmosphere
of the Sea-water, which the Wind blows up,
and which looks like a Fog Commonly we see
this before the Ship, and sometimes also be∣hind
to the Lee-ward (so they call that side of
the Ship towards the Sea) over-against the Sun,
where the Shadow of the Sail falleth. It is not
the Shadow of the Sail, but a Bow sheweth it
self in the Shadow of the Sail. We see this
pleasant reflexion, in the small drops of the
Salt-water of several colours, like the Rain-bows
in the Skies, that are seen over-against the
dark Clouds.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="162"/>
This brings to my Mind another Phanome∣non,
<HI>viz.</HI> that in the Clouds near the Sum, a
very bright Light is seen, like a Parelion or
Mock-sun. These Lights are called Weather-galls
by the Sea-men.</P>
<P>This bright Light we find in the lower-most
Air, in the dark shady Clouds, that are not
unlike to a Cloud of Rain, because it is full of
drops, wherein the Sun is represented, as
things are in a Looking-glass.</P>
<P>This clearness of the Sun causeth a Heat,
which drives from it a Rain-bow, figured by
the Sun, which Bow are the Drops that by the
Heat of the Sun are changed into a Vapour
or Fog, and this Vapour shews like smoak in
the Air, when the Cold remits, wherein these
Colours are no more seen.</P>
<P>But in these raised Drops as aforesaid, the
Sun represents it self, and causeth these Co∣lours,
which are truly distinct, and represent
Blew, Yellow and Red; which are the three
primary Colours of the Bow.</P>
<P>Concerning the bigness thereof, I did consi∣dered
and minded the Bow that I saw in <HI>Spitz∣bergen,</HI>
and found that it moved about with the
Sun by Day and by Night, and that it appear∣ed
much bigger in the Morning, Evening, and
at Night, than in the Day-time.</P>
<P>I will not mention the Whirlwinds which
are unknown in these cold Countries; that
used to take up the Water into the Air: But
yet I will not omit the small Whirlwinds,
that proceed from the high Mountains, from
whence the Wind recoils, and so turneth
round about.</P>
<P><PB REF="162"/>
<PB REF="163"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="163"/>
We see farther in <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> that the Sea
as well as the other Waters, sends forth a Va∣pour,
when the Clold encreases, which Vapour
is turned into Rain in the Air, or into Snow,
and it smelleth like a Fog or steaming Wa∣ter.</P>
<P>It is likewise an Observation there, that
when we see great Vapours or Fogs in the Air,
and that such a Vapour riseth almost every
moment in a clear Sun-shiny Day, without
Wind or other Causes, the cold Weather is a∣bout
to remit: But when the Air is overbur∣dened
by these Vapours, the Couds are dissi∣pated,
and they last a great while with con∣stant
Wind. Such Vapours as we see in
the Air, stick to our Cloaths and Hair
like Sweat.</P>
<P>Out of these small vaporous Drops the Snow
is first generated: First of all you see a small
Drop, as big as a single Sand in the Plate <HI>E</HI>
marked with <HI>A.</HI> This is augmented or en∣creased
by the Fog, until it cometh to be like
unto a Shield or Plate with six corners as clear
and transparent as Glass, to these six corners
sticks the Fog like Drops, as <HI>B.</HI> then it freezes
and splits asunder, so that you see the Figure of
a Star, as <HI>C.</HI> which yet is still frozen together;
until in time it is quite parted or divided asun∣der
one from the other, and then you see
a Star with six Points, as <HI>D.</HI> which Points are
not yet quite frozen, because there are still
hanging some wet drops between the Points;
until at length it assumes the perfect Form of
a Star, with Points serrated at the sides, like
Ferne, on the Points whereof still hand some
Drops, as you see at <HI>E,</HI> which are lost,
and so it is turned into an exact and perfect
<PB N="52" REF="164"/>
Star: And this is the Formation of the snowy
Star, which is seen in the severest Frost so
long until at last it loseth all its Points. See <HI>F.</HI>
as to the many sorts of Snow that fall in <HI>Spitz∣bergen,</HI>
and in what Weather I have made
these following Observations and Distinctions,
Number 1. in the Plate of <HI>E.</HI> sheweth the
Snow that falleth, when it is tolerable cold
and rainy withal, then it falls like unto small
Roses, Needles and small Corns. When the
cold Weather doth remit the Snow falleth like
Stars, with many points like the Leaves of
Ferne. Plate <HI>E.</HI> Numb. 2. If it be only a
Fog at last, and it snoweth much, it looketh as you
see Numb. 3. If it is very cold and windy like
Numb. 4. When it is very cold and not windy
withal, the Snow falleth like unto Stars in a
cluster, because the Wind cannot blow them
asunder, like Numb. 5. When the Wind was
<HI>North-West,</HI> or the Skies were thick of Clouds,
and it was stormy withal, there fell Hail that
was round and oblong all over full of Prickles,
and of the same bigness as you see it as Num∣ber
6.</P>
<P>There is many more sorts of starry Snow to
be seen, with more Points, and some like unto
a Heart, but they are all generated after the
same manner, by the Eastern and Northern
Winds. The needly Snow is generated by
Westerly and Southerly Winds: If the Snow
is not dispersed by the Wind, it falleth down
in cl;usters</P>
<P>But when the Wind driveth it, Stars, or
Needles only fall, every piece by it self, like
the Atoms in the Sun.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="164"/>
Thus much have I observed hitherto of the
Snow, and find that also when it is cold and
a North Wind blows, all sorts of Snow, both
starry and of other shapes, fall as well in these
Countries as in <HI>Spitzbergen.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Plants of Spitzbergen.</HEAD>
<P>GEnerally the Figures of the Plants I here
present you with were all drawn by the
Life upon the place when they were fresh, and
of their natural size, except the Rock-plant
with but one Leaf, and the Plant like Horse-Tail,
that stands by it, which because of their
largeness could not be well drawn so big at

the Life. All the Herbs and the Mosses grow
upon the Grit and Sand of the Stones, where
the Water falleth down, and on that side of the
Hill which the East and North Winds cannot
easily come at. The Plants owe much of their
growth to the Dung of the Birds.</P>
<P>There were a great many small Herbs, which
for want of time I could not delineate, but I
purpose to do it hereafter, if God b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esseth me
with Life and Health, when I make my second
Voyage thither.</P>
<P>I omitted the white Poppy, whereof we
stuck the Flowers in our Hats; the whole
Plant was but about a Span long.</P>
<P>Besides I have not mentioned the <HI>Red Sorrel,</HI>
I mean that which was shewed to me at <HI>Bremen</HI>
by the <HI>Dutch</HI> Gardener, which was of the same
size, but the Leaves of that of <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> are
Red.</P>
<P>I desire the courteous Reader to accept at
present of these for a Sample, to shew him that
on these rough, barren and cold Mountains,
there yet grow some Plants, for the Nourish∣ment
both of Man and Beast. The Herbs grow
of their perfection in a short time, for in <HI>June,</HI>
when we first arrived at <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> we saw
but very little Green, and yet in <HI>July</HI> most of
them were in flower, and some of them had
their Seeds already ripe, whence me may ob∣serve
the length of their Summer.</P>
<P>I proceed to the Description of those Plants,
which I had time to delineate, and begin with
those, that put forth their Leaves only at, and
about their Roots, and have but few or no
Leaves on their Stalks.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="166"/>
Then shall follow those that have single
Leaves on their Stalks; then those that have
pairs of Leaves or opposite ones, afterward
those with three Leaves, and then conclude
with the imperfect Plants.</P>

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of a Plant with Aloe-Leaves.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a very pretty Herb, and puts forth
thick, prickly and sad green Leaves like
those of Aloes, a brown naked Stalk, about
half the length of your Finger, whereon hang
round Heads of Flesh-coloured Flowers in
Bunches, which are hardly to be discerned by
the naked Eye, one Flower close above ano∣ther,
and near to one another Tab. <HI>G.</HI> marked
with <HI>a.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes two Stalks shook out of one Plant,
one bigger that the other. Yet each Stalk has
two of these Bunches of Flowers.</P>
<P>I could not delineate its Seed for want of
time. The Root consists of many small Fibers.</P>
<P>We gathered it in great plenty on the 17<HI>th.</HI>
of <HI>July,</HI> behind the Cookery of <HI>Harlem,</HI> in the
running Water.</P>
<P>I know not well, to what kind this may be
referred. <HI>Caspar Bauhim</HI> maketh mention of an
Herb in his <HI>Prodromus</HI> of his <HI>Amphitheater</HI> of
Plants in the 5<HI>th.</HI> Book and 15<HI>th.</HI> Chapter, which
he calls <HI>Limonium Maritimum,</HI> which he de∣scribeth
<PB N="57" REF="166"/>
with small, roundish and thick Leaves,
like House-leek, between which spread forth
small Stalks with pale red Flowers; but the
Root doth not agree with our Plant, for his is
long, red and parted at top, whereas this Root
consists in many small Fibers, and is not red.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of small House-leek.</HEAD>
<P>THE Leaves of this are indented and very
like those of our Dasies, for which I should
have taken it also, had not it been for the Flow∣er,
only the Leaves are thicker and more juicy,
like those of House-leek, or, as we call it, those
of the lesser House-leek: The Leaves grow
round about the Root, betwixt them is a small
Stalk of the length of your little Finger, which
is round and hairy, and generally without
Leaves, save only where it divides into ano∣ther
Stalk, at which place is a small Leaf.</P>
<P>The Flowers grow in scaley Heads (like unto
the Flowers of <HI>Stohceas</HI>) are of a brown co∣lour,
and have five pointed Leaves, as I think
with five small Chives within, like unto the
Flowers of Wall-pepper or Stone-crop. I found
only the Flowers, for the Seed was not yet
ripe. The Root is somewhat thick and strait,
with many strong and thick Fibers from the
sides of it; it may be referred to the House-leeks,
<PB N="58" REF="167"/>
and called small indented or crenated
House-leek, with scaly Heads.</P>
<P>This Plant I found in the <HI>Danish</HI> Harbour

<P>These four following Plants are all Crows-feet,

<P>The first and fourth in Tab. <HI>G</HI> at <HI>c.</HI> and in

their Leaves, whereof they have both two
sorts, the undermost broader, and not so much
cut, and the uppermost smaller and deeper
divided, yet they differ in this, that the first
doth not grow so high, and puts out many
Leaves out of one and the same Root, but the
fourth in Tab. <HI>I</HI> at <HI>d,</HI> hath but one long Stalk,
whereon sprouted out one single Leaf at a place.
The fourth hath yellow Flowers, but whether
the first hath yellow ones (which I suppose) I
cannot well remember. The Flowers of the
fourth hath five Leaves, broader at the ends
and smaller at the bottom; they grow out of
a rough <HI>Perianthium</HI> or Cup that is split into

five also. See Tab. <HI>I</HI> at <HI>d.</HI> The Flower of
the first have six Leaves, they are small
and the Seed-vessels are like one another.</P>
<P>The Roots are differing, that of the first
hath many small Fibers, and the fourth hath
a thicker and longer, with tender and small
Fibers. The first burns the Tongue like <HI>Persicaria</HI>
or Flea-bean, but somewhat less than in our
Countries. The Leaves of the fourth do not
burn so.</P>
<P>I found them both in the <HI>Danish</HI> Haven, the
first in great quantities; they flower in <HI>July.</HI></P>
<P>The second hath somewhat differing Leaves
from the two former, for although the lower∣most
Leaves agree with them of the first, yet
they are less, and those that grow higher, and
come up after the lowermost, are in two places
deeper cut, so that the first part of the
Leaf that stands out before, is not very
unlike a Tongue, but the two sides are but
a little indented in Table <HI>G</HI> it is marked
with <HI>e.</HI></P>
<P>There is also a difference in the Leaves of
this Plant, as well as in the two before menti∣oned,
for the Leaves that are nearest to the
Flowers are small and deeply cut, and that
with two incisions, and it burns the Tongue.
The Flower is small, and hath six and some∣times
seven Leaves. The Seed-vessel is like un∣to
the former, only it is less. The Root is
like that of the first, only it hath more Fibers;
there is also a kind of thick sheath that sur∣roundeth
the Stalk, as is also to be seen in the
fourth. I found this Plant near the first, in
the <HI>Danish</HI> Haven the 16<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>July.</HI> The
third is yet smaller, but fuller of Leaves, on∣ly
<PB N="60" REF="170"/>
they are less, and not so deep cut, although
they have also four Incisions like the second,
in this I did not find that difference in the
Leaves, between the lowermost and those that
are nearer the Flower, it is in the Tab. <HI>H</HI>
marked with <HI>c.</HI> The Flower is of five white
Leaves, its Seed-vessel I could not yet see.
Its Roots are small Fibers, I found it in the
<HI>South Haven</HI> on the Sixteenth of <HI>July;</HI> it
burns the Tongue, the Leaves are thick and
juicy.</P>
<P>I found in the same place another small
Plant, exactly like to these, only the Flowers
thereof were of a purple Colour, and the
Leaves not so juicy; wherefore I did not
draw it.</P>

<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Scurvy-grass.</HEAD>
<P>THis <HI>Scurvy-grass</HI> sends forth a great many
Leaves from one Root, that spread them∣selves
round about it upon the Ground. The
Stalk grows out of the middle of these Leaves,
which is a great deal lower than in our Coun∣try,
with a few Leaves underneath the Sprouts.
The Flowers are of four white Leaves, they
grow many on the same Stalk one above the
other, when one Flower fades, another cometh
in its room when the Flower is past; the Seed
appears in a longish Box, as you may see in
<PB N="61" REF="170"/>
the Figure; when on the contrary in ours the
Seed is found in a round one. The Root is
white, somewhat thick and streight, with some
small Fibers below.</P>
<P>A great quantity of this Plant is found on
the Rocks, where they are not much exposed
to the East and North Winds; I found it most
in the <HI>South, English,</HI> and <HI>Danish Havens,</HI>
the Earth was quite covered with it in the <HI>Da∣nish.</HI></P>
<P>It was the first Herb I found in <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI>
when we Landed the first time, it was so small
that I could hardly discern it to be Scurvy-grass,
but afterwards we found it in its full
perfection, and it seeded in the Month of
<HI>July.</HI></P>
<P>It is observable, that the Leaves of this
Herb have but little sharpness at <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI>
and therefore it is much weaker than the Scur∣vy-grass
of our Countries, so that we eat it in∣stead
of Salads in <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> which we could
not do our Scurvy-grass.</P>

sometimes five, sometimes six, and sometimes
I have seen nine Leaves, the Stamina of the

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of a Snake-weed.</HEAD>
<P>THis is small <HI>Snake-weed,</HI> and is found very
rarely in <HI>Spitzbergen;</HI> the undermost
Leaves of this Plant are the biggest, but they
are not above the bredth of ones Nail, they
grow singly on the Stalk, yet not above three
of them, except the lowermost: the nearer the
Flower, the smaller they are; they have with∣in,
not far from the edge many small knobs or
spots answering to the points of the Leaves,
wherein the Veins or Nerves are terminated,
besides the Leaves are not quite plain, but
somewhat rumpled at the brims. Out of the
Root sprouts forth sometimes single and some∣times
double Stalks, as you may see in the Cut,
and this by-stalk is always somewhat lower
than the chief Stalk.</P>
<P>The Flower grows in a close Spike, with

<P>THis Plant runneth upon the Ground, and

<P>The Leaves as I think are like those of <HI>Peri∣winkle,</HI>
but they are somewhat rounder, and
the largest of them are bent in before. The
Stalk is somewhat knotty and woody.</P>
<P>The Flower appeareth at first, wrapt up
like a Leaf, but after it is grown out a little
more, one may see it to be a Flower, it grows
out between the Leaves on the same Stalks.</P>
<P>The colour and shape of these Flowers, I

<P>THE Animals of <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> here descri∣bed,
are either those with two or with four
Legs.</P>
<P>About <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> also are some Creatures that
live only in the Water, and have no Legs (except
one would take their Fins, that are about their
<PB N="72" REF="175"/>
Breast for Legs, because as hereafter shall be shewn,
their Fins are jointed like Legs underneath the Skin.)
Some live in the Water, and also upon the Ice and

<P>This <HI>Snite</HI> which is also called the Strand-runner
(because it keepeth about the <HI>Strand</HI>)
is no bigger than a Lark.</P>
<P>Its Bill is narrow, thin, and corner'd with∣all.
Our Snites Bills are at the farther end
broader and roundish, and cut in with cross
notches like a Rasp to rasp Wood withal; so
that the whole upper Jaw and Bill looketh ex∣actly
like a Rasp with its handle. Our Snites
are also bigger than those of <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> other∣wise
they are very like one another in Shape
and Colour; this Bill both above and below is
four square, of a brownish colour, and about
two Inches long. The Head is roundish, and
of the same thickness with the Neck.</P>
<P>Their Feet are made of three divided Claw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

The Root hath a great many Branches that
are divided again, and stick very close unto
the Rock underneath the Water. The whole
Plant groweth under Water several Fathoms:
When we wayed our Anchor, we pulled it
up in great quantity from the Ground.</P>
<P>Together with this Herbs we pulled up the
hairy Plant that stands by it, about six Foot
long, and it is very like an Horses Tail, only
that here and there it hath some small knobs
like nitty Hair, or such as are split at the ends;
the whole Plant was browner of colour than
the former, and its Roots was fixed unto the
former.</P>
<P>In these Plants were some redish Worms
wrapt or folded up like Caterpillers, with
many Legs. They are figured Tab. <HI>P.</HI> at <HI>i.</HI></P>
<P>The Herb was like Dodder, wherefore it
may be call'd Water or Rock Silk. Amongst
all the Icons that I have seen in printed Herbals,
I find it comes nearest to that hairy Plant,
which <HI>Antony Donat,</HI> in his Book of Plants,
growing about <HI>Venice,</HI> calleth in his second
Book, <HI>Muscus argenteus Marinus, similis Plumae,</HI>
only this is not as white as Silver, but rather
yellow or brownish.</P>
<P>Of these two Herbs we found great plenty
in the <HI>South Haven</HI> on the 20<HI>th.</HI> and 21<HI>th.</HI> of
<HI>July.</HI></P>
<P>There is another Sea Plant, which I called
Sea-grass, whereof there is plenty in the <HI>Eng∣lish
Haven</HI> underneath the Water above eight
Foot long. The Leaves were about two or
three Fingers broad, of a yellow Colour like
Glew, and transparent, ending in a blunt point,
at the top smooth edged, without nicks or

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Rock Plant.</HEAD>
<P>THis plant belongeth to those called <HI>Wier</HI>
by the <HI>Dutchmen,</HI> and <HI>Fucus</HI> in <HI>Latin.</HI></P>
<P>It has a broad flat Stalk like a Leaf, and yet
there sprout out of it many equally broad
<HI>Leavs</HI> like it, as Twigs out of a Tree, at the
the top of the Stalks there are little narrow lon∣gish
Leaves, some have five, others seven of
these, of a yellow Colour, as the Herb is also
and they are transparent like Glew, I know
not whether one may take thim for its Flow∣ers.
Close to these there grow other oblong
Leaves, that are hollow, and as it was blown
up, and fill'd with Wind, and many lesser
Bladders round about close to one another:
The Leaves that are blown up have nothing in
them but Wind; for when I pressed them to∣gether,
they gave a little bounce, whether
these small Bladders have Seeds in them or no,
I could not observe.</P>
<P>The Seamen informed me, That from the
Seeds of that Plant, the small Sea Snails are
produced, but I am not satisfied, whether they
proceed from these Bladders, or from Eggs as
our Snails do.</P>
<P>It may be after the same manner, as we find
on many Leaves in our Country, Bladders filled
up with the Seeds of Worms or Caterpillers,
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et I dare not assert it, because I had no op∣portunity,
to search narrowly into the Matter;
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Root groweth out of the Rocks, where∣fore
<PB N="68" REF="178"/>
I call it a Rock Plant, it hath some Fi∣bers,
and is sometimes round; I found this
Herb in great plenty, first in the <HI>South Bay,</HI>
near the <HI>Cookery</HI> of <HI>Harlem,</HI> where we take up
the Water; then in the <HI>Mussel Haven</HI> at <HI>Spitz∣bergen;</HI>
then at <HI>Cales</HI> in <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>When this Herb is dried, it looketh brown
and blackish, it gives and groweth wet again
when a South or West Wind blows, because of
the Salt that penetrates it; but when the Wind
is East or North it is stiff and dry.</P>
<P>Among all the Figures that I have seen, I
find none liker than that given in the 39<HI>th,</HI>
Book, and the 50<HI>th.</HI> Chapter of the <HI>Iferdunish
Herbal,</HI> by the Name of the <HI>Alge Marina Platyceros
porosa,</HI> only that this is porous or spongy and
white. In the Tab. <HI>F.</HI> it is marked with <HI>b.</HI></P>
<P>The Leaves of the great Rock Herb, are
very like unto a Man's Tongue, it is on each
or both sides curled, but plain before and not
curled, through the middle of it run two black
Stroaks or Nerves to the Stalk, and on the out∣side
of them appear many black spots, within
the black stroaks, on each side, to the middle∣most
plain stroaks; the Herb is adorned with
small curles, in the middle it is quite smooth to
the Stalk, on the end of the Leaf, next the
Stalk, are two white stroaks almost to the
middle of the Leaf, bending round outwards,
if they were quite closed, they would make
an Oval.</P>
<P>The Leaf is above six Foot long, and yel∣low,
and the Stalk yet longer; the Stalk is
round and smooth, of a yellow colour like un∣boiled
Glew, near the Root it is thicker than
at the Leaf, and it smells of Mussels.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="178"/>
tants there call <HI>Edder</HI>) and costeth when it is
cleansed from the Moss a Crown a Pound, as
I have been informed; But the Feathers of
the <HI>Mountain-ducks</HI> of <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> which they
call Down, the Seamen put into their Pillows,
and Straw-sacks, which if they should be clean∣sed
would be more worth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kirmew</HI> layeth their Eggs upon Moss,
and so do the <HI>Rotges.</HI> The Nests of the rest of
the Birds were too high for us, so that we could
hardly, and not without great difficulty reach
them. If it be never so dark by reason of a
Mist, yet every Bird knoweth how to find
their own Nest again, and flyeth directly to it.</P>
<P>Concerning the Names of the Birds I have
made use of those, that the Seamen have given
them formerly, according to their own Fancy,
that he that heareth them called by these Names,
may also know how to find them by them in
this Book.</P>
<P>Some of these Birds, as <HI>Lumbs, Strundjagers,
Mallemucks, Kirmews,</HI> and the <HI>Mews</HI> called
<HI>Kutyegehfen,</HI> I have also seen about <HI>England,
Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> and also in the <HI>Spanish</HI>
Seas, nay even upon the <HI>Elve</HI> by <HI>Hamburg,</HI> I
have heard the <HI>Kirmew</HI> and <HI>Kutyegehf</HI> cry, but
there is a difference, as well between the Beasts
as Men of other Countries.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>1. Of the Rathsher</HEAD>
<P>First of the <HI>Rathsher</HI> (or Alderman in <HI>Engl∣ish</HI>)
for this is the first of the thin billed Birds
that have three Claws, and is called so by the
Seamen, because he is very stately and hand∣some
<PB N="78" REF="179"/>
Bird, but less than that which they call
<HI>Burgermeister</HI> (or Major in <HI>English.</HI>)</P>
<P>This Bird hath a sharp, narrow and thin
Bill, and hath only three Claws or Toes, that
are joined together by a black Skin, but he hath
no Claw behind. His Legs are not very long,
and black, as the Eyes are also.</P>
<P>This Bird is whiter than the Snow, for when
you see him upon the Ice, you may distinguish
him from the Snow; he shews very beautiful,
with his white Body, his black Bill and Eyes,
black Legs and Feet, and besides he is very
well shaped.</P>
<P>His Tail is pretty long and broad, like a
Lady's Fan.</P>
<P>His Cry is somewhat lower than the little
<HI>Kirmews,</HI> as if he did say <HI>Kar,</HI> when she cries
<HI>Kir,</HI> he spreads his Wings and Tail out when
he flies, as the <HI>Strundjager</HI> or Crow doth. He
doth not willingly swim in the Water as the
other Birds do, nor doth he much care for
wetting his Feet, but he stays rather where it
is dry, yet he loves Fish mightily; and so the
Proverb that we commonly say of the Cats is
true of him; <HI>The Cat loves to eat Fish, but does
not love to wet her Feet.</HI></P>
<P>I have seen him upon the Ice feed on the
Dung of a Sea-horse, upon whose Body he
will rest while he is alive, as Crows will do
in our Countries. He flieth commonly alone
by himself, but where there is a Prey they
flock in great numbers.</P>
<P>I did delineate them in the shallow Corner
(called shallow Point) in <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> on the
10<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> when we shot him, he was not
wild at all, so that I could have knock'd him
down with the Gun. See Tab. <HI>L.</HI> at <HI>a.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Broad or Web-footed Birds.</HEAD>
<P>THere are several sorts of these about
<HI>Spitzbergen.</HI> Some of them have thin
pointed Bills, others have thick and broad ones.</P>
<P>Some of the thick billed one have them di∣vided
or parted as the <HI>Malle-mucken</HI> (mad Gnats
in <HI>English</HI>) others have undivided ones, as the
<HI>Parret</HI> so called.</P>
<P>There is also a considerable difference in the
Heels of these Birds, for some of them have
Heels, as the <HI>Mountain-duck, Kirmeu</HI> and <HI>Malle-mucks:</HI>
Others have them not at all, as the
<HI>Burgermeister, Rathsher, Strundjager, Kutyegehf, Par∣ret,
Lumbe, Pigeon,</HI> and the <HI>Red Goose;</HI> no Wa∣ter
sticks to their Feathers no more than on the
Swans and other Water Fowl, for it runs off
from them, as if they were oiled all over.</P>
<P>Some are Birds of Prey, others not. There
is also a difference in their flying.</P>
<P>Some flie like unto a Partridge, as that called
the Pigeon, others like Swallows, as the
<HI>Lumbs</HI> and <HI>Red Geese,</HI> others like the Mews, as
the <HI>Mallemucke, Rathsher</HI> and <HI>Strundjager,</HI> others
like the <HI>Stork,</HI> as the <HI>Burgermeister.</HI></P>
<P>The Birds of Prey are, the <HI>Burgermeister,
Rathsher, Strundjager, Kutyegehf</HI> and <HI>Mallemucke.</HI>
There is also a great difference in their Flesh;
the Birds of Prey are not so good to eat as the
others, except you hang them up by their Legs
for some days, that the Train Oil may run
out of them, and the Air blow through them,
<PB N="76" REF="180"/>
and then you do not taste the Train Oil so
strong, for else it would make you vomit.</P>
<P>The Pigeons, Parrets, Red Geese and Ducks,
are the most fleshy, the old Lumbs have a very
tough and dry Flesh, not to disparage the Rotges,
Kirmews and young Lumbs when boiled, and
the Fat taken away from them, and afterwards
fryed in Butter; for then one may make a shift
to eat them;but if you should eat their Fat, it
would vomit and disorder the Stomach very
much. Thse Birds except the <HI>Strundjager,
Kirmew</HI> and <HI>Mountain-duck,</HI> all make their Nests
upon the high Rocks, where they are secured
from the Foxes and Bears;but some of them
make their Nests higher than others.</P>
<P>They fit in so great-numbers or flocks upon
the Rocks, chiefly at the time when they hatch
their Young ones, which is about the latter end
of <HI>June,</HI> and beginning of <HI>July,</HI> that if they
flie up when the Sun shineth, they shade the
Ground like a Cloud, and make so great a noise,
that one Man can hardly hear the other.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kirmews</HI> and <HI>Mountain-ducks,</HI> and also
the <HI>Strundjagers.</HI> make their Nests on low
Grouands, (that one would think that the high
Water must needs run over them) on the small
Islnds, where they are secure from the Foxes,
but not from the white Bears, for they swim in
the Water from one Islands to the other. We
took up great store of their Eggs.</P>
<P>The Nests of these Birds are not all made
after the same manner. For the <HI>Mountains-duck</HI>
makes its Nest of the Feathers of its own Belly,
mixing them with Moss.</P>
<P>The Feathers of these Nests are not the
Edder Down, brought us from Island, for
that cometh from great Birds (that the Inhabi∣tants)</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="180"/>
of a Lark;but when the sun shines upon
it, it shews blewish, very like those two Colours
observed on our Ducks Necks when the Sun
shines upon them. They feed upon the little
gray Worms and Shrimps.</P>
<P>We shot some of them in the South Harbour,
near the Cookery of <HI>Harlem</HI> they had not the
taste of Fish at all. See Tab. <HI>K</HI> at <HI>a.</HI></P>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>II. Of the Snow-bird.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Snow-bird</HI> is no bigger than a sparrow,
and like a Linnet in his Shape, Bill and Co∣lour.</P>
<P>The Bill is short and pointed, its Head of
the same thickness with its Neck. The Legs
are also like the Linnets, their Feet are divided
into three fore Claws, with longish crooked
Nails, the hinder Claw is somewhat shorter,
but hath a long bended Spur, or Nail. The
Legs are grayish, and not very long.</P>
<P>From their Head over all their Belly to the
Tail they are white like Snow, but all over
their Backs and Wings they are gray. Some
of them are gray all over, but these are little
Ones.</P>
<P>I can tell nothing of its singing, only that
it whisseleth a little, as Birds use to do when
they are hungry.</P>
<P>When we sailed near the Ice, they came in
great flocks to us in our Ship, near the Island
of <HI>John Mayen,</HI> and were so tame, that you
could take them up with your Hands.</P>
<P>They run upon the Ice where I only saw
them, and not upon the Land, which is the
reason that they are called <HI>Snow-birds.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="181"/>
They kept with our Ship till we catch'd the
first Whale, and after that the other Birds fright∣ned
them away.</P>
<P>We fed them with Oatmeal, but when their
Bellies were full, they would not suffer them∣selves
to be taken up. We put some of them
in a Cage, and hung them up in the Cabin,
but they did not live long.</P>
<P>We eat some of them, and they were not of
an unpleasant taste, but very lean. If I may
give my Opinion, why the Birds flie to the
Ships, I believe that they are stray'd from the
Island, and that so the Hunger compels them to
the Ships for Food. Tab. <HI>K.</HI> at <HI>b.</HI></P>

<HEAD>III. Of the Ice-birds.</HEAD>
<P>I saw also in the <HI>English Haven,</HI> a very beau∣tiful
<HI>Ice-bird,</HI> which was so tame, that we might
have taken him up almost with our Hands, but
we would not go too near him with our Gun,
for fear that we should shoot him all in pieces,
and so spoil his curious Feathers, so we mis∣sed
him, and he flew away.</P>
<P>The Sun shined at that time upon him, which
made him look like Gold, so as it dazled our
Eyes almost. He was as big as a small Pigeon.</P>
<P>I would willingly have delineated him, if we
could have catched him. I saw but this one

<HEAD>II. Of the Pigeon.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Pigeon,</HI> or rather the <HI>Pigeon-diver,</HI> is al∣so
one of the beautifullest Birds of <HI>Spitzbergen.</HI>
It is of the bigness of a Duck, the Bill is some∣what
long, thin and sharp pointed, at the
point the upper Bill is somewhat crooked, a∣bout
two Inches long and hollow within. It
hath but three red Toes on its Feet, with
crooked Claws; it hath short redish Legs, and
a short Tail.</P>
<P>Some of these Birds are black all their body
over; but others. and so was that which I de∣lineated;
about their Wings, and in the middle
they are white pyed with black, but under∣neath
the Wings they are quite white; others
are in the middle of their Wings quite white;
their Bill is red within; the Tongue is also
red and hollow; they cry like young Pigeons,
whence they have their Name, for they are in
nothing else like them. In their Crops I found
Shrimps, or Prawns, and small Sand-stones.</P>
<P>They do not flie high over the Sea, and
their flight is very like the Partridges: They
do not flie many together as the Lumbs, but
usually by pares, and sometimes one alone by
its self.</P>
<P>They can keep a great while under Water;
wherefore they may be called Diving Pigeons.</P>
<P>But chiefly when they are pursed by Men, or
if their Wings be hurt by a Shot, they will dive
and keep a great while under Water; and some∣times
they get underneath the Ice, and there
they are suffocated, they were as nimble and quick
under Water (if their Wings or Feet are not quite
shot off) as we could row with our Boat. Their
<PB N="80" REF="183"/>
Flesh is good to eat when the Fat is taken a∣way
from it, if afterwards it be fryed in But∣ter.</P>

also and short.</P>

than the Diving Pigeon, as big as a mid∣ling
Duck. In their Crops I find small Fish
and Prawns, and also some Sand-stones; and
one of them flying over our Ship dropp'd a
large red Prawn into the Ship. I also delinea∣ted
it in the mentioned place. They say
likewise, that small fresh River Fish are their
Prey; but this I cannot relate for certain.</P>
<P>When they have young ones, they common∣ly
sit by the old ones one or two on the Water,
who teach them to dive and swim. After the
old ones have brought their young in their
Bill, from the Rocks to the Water, the Prey∣ing
Bird called <HI>Burgermeister</HI> sometimes catches
the young ones, when the old ones are not
<PB N="81" REF="183"/>
present, and sometimes when they are also, for
they are not able to resist them.</P>
<P>They love their young ones so well, that
they will be killed before they will leave them,
(and will defend them as a Hen doth her
Chickens, swimming about them) at other
times they are very hard to be shot; for as
soon as they see the Fire, they are immediately
under Water, or fly away. They fly in great
flocks, with pointed Wings like Swallows, and
move their Wings much in their flight. One
can hardly know the young <HI>Lumbs</HI> from the
old ones, at the first sight, if you do not take
exact notice of their Bills; for the upper part
turns beside the under part, at the point, and
the undermost beside the uppermost, as you see
in the Cross Bill, yet not so much in these;
and it is commonly done in the 15th, 16th, to
the 20th year of their Age. The old ones are
full of Flesh, but it is very dry and tough, and
therefore unpleasant to eat.</P>
<P>They boil them like the Pigeons, and scum
off the Fat when they boil, then they fry them
in Batter. I did not see them upon the Ice,
but abundance of them upon the Mountains:
They go waddling from one side to the other,
like the diving Pigeons. I have seen many
Thousands of them together in the <HI>Danish</HI> Har∣bour,
on the Mountains, on that side where the
East and Northern Winds could not blow hard
or not fully upon them, (and so do all other
Birds chuse such places on the Mountains for
their Habitations) where the Herbs do grow.</P>
<P>But I saw not so many by the Haven of <HI>Mag∣dalen,</HI>
where I drew my Figure on the 25th of
<HI>July.</HI> Afterwards I saw some of them in the
<PB N="82" REF="184"/>
<HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>North</HI> Sea, not far from the <HI>Heilg∣land.</HI>

<HEAD>IV. Of the Mew called Kutge-gehef.</HEAD>
<P>This is beautiful <HI>Mew,</HI> and is called
<HI>Kutge-gehef,</HI> because it cryeth so: He hath
a Bill somewhat bent, as the <HI>Burgermeister;</HI> on
the undermost part of its Bill is a small knob
or rising: About his black Eyes he hath a red
circle, as the <HI>Burgermeister;</HI> and he hath but
three Claws, joyned together with a black Skin.</P>
<P>The Legs are also black, and but short; the
Tail is somewhat long and broad, like a Fan.</P>
<P>All the Belly is as white as Snow; the
Wings and Back are grey, and the point of the
Wings black. He is almost as big as an ordi∣nary
<HI>Mew,</HI> but something less than the <HI>Strunt-jager.</HI>
When we cut the fat off from the
Whales, we saw abundance of them fly by the
Ship, and heard them cry.</P>
<P>When the Seamen have a mind to catch
some of them, they bait their Hooks with a
piece of Whales Fat, and so tye the Hooks to
a Line, and fling it into the Sea, and so they
catch not only these, but all the other Birds of
Prey. He flieth with small Wings as a com∣mon
Mew, and dives not. His Food is the
Fat of the Whale. He is hunted by sthe <HI>Strunt-jager</HI>
(in English <HI>Dung-hunter</HI>) who leave him
not till he dungs, which the <HI>Strunt-jager</HI>
eats.</P>
<P>This I could hardly believe at first, until af∣terwards
I saw it my self very often: that
which I drew was catched by our Ship-boys
<PB REF="184"/>

with a Hook, in the <HI>South Haven.</HI> I did pecu∣liarly
observe in this Bird, that it used to swim
upon the Water, and hold its Head up against
the Wind, if it was never so great a Storm;
and so we found whole flocks of them swim
upon the Water together.</P>
<P>This is not only to be understood of this
Bird, but also of all the rest, for they look
against the Wind, that their Feathers may not
be blown asunder and opened; for if they
should sit or swim with the Wind, their Fea∣thers
would be blown asunder by the cold
Wind, and so the Cold would get in between
them to their Skin, which perhaps might pre∣judice
their Health, for Birds are covered with
their Feathers as Men are with their Clothes.</P>
<P>And so, when they fly up, they press against
the Wind with their Bodies, and expand their
Wings, and so fly away very swiftly; also their
Feathers would be entangled, so that they
could not have a sure and steddy flight, but
faulter in their flying, like Birds that learn to
fly. There is but little Meat upon them; we
eat but the Legs and the Breast, for the Wings
are nothing but Skin and Bone. We have a
Proverb, and say, <HI>Thou art as light as a Mew:</HI>
This we may very well say of these Mews.
I have seen them since in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Sea, and
also in the <HI>North Sea,</HI> but yet they differ from
these; and so do the Beasts of all Countries.

<HEAD>V. Of the Burgermeister.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Burgermeister</HI> (in English <HI>Major</HI>) is
the biggest of all the Birds of <HI>Spitsbergen,</HI>
wherefore this Name is given him as being the
Chief of them. His Bill is crooked, of a yel∣low
colour, narrow and thick; his Under-bill
is somewhat rising or knobby at the point or∣end,
a great deal more than the <HI>Kutge-gebefs,</HI>
which looketh very pretty, as if he had a Cher∣ry
in his Mouth; he hath longish Nostrils, and
a red Ring about his Eyes, as I mentioned
when I spoke of the <HI>Kutge-gehef;</HI> he hath but
three Claws, of a grey colour, his Legs are
grey, and not quite so long as those of a Stork,
yet he is almost equally big with him.</P>
<P>His Tail is broad, like a Fan, and white,
which is chiefly to be understood of these
Birds when they fly; his Wings are of a pale
colour, and so is all the Back, but the Wings
are white at the tip, and so is the whole Body.
He Builds his Nest very high in the Clifts of
the Rocks, where you can neither shoot nor
catch them any other way; which was the
reason I could not see their Nests. I have seen
sometimes two, three and four of their young
ones together; we shoot most of them when
we draw a dead Whale behind our Ship, where
they flock in great numbers, and bite off great
pieces of the fat of the Whale; at other times
we must shoot at them a great distance, as
at other wild Birds, such as Ravens, Herns, and
the like.</P>
<P><PB REF="186"/>
<PB REF="187"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="187"/>
His Cry is like the Cry of some Ravens
that I have sometimes heard; he flyeth in the
Air like a Stork; he preys upon young Lumbs
as the Hawk doth upon all sorts of Birds; he
feeds also upon the fat of the Whale, whereof
he doth swallow down peices as big as ones
Hand whole.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mallemucks</HI> are mightily afraid of him,
they will lye down before him (when they are
upon the Carcass of a dead Whale) then he bites
them about the Neck, which I believe doth
not hurt them much, because they have a very
thick Skin, for else they would oppose and re∣sist,
him, or fly away, but they do not matter
it, neither will they leave their Meal for his
biting. I have seen him also about the Sea∣Horses,
whose Dung he eats. He flyeth com∣monly
single, except when they meet at their
Prey. He loves to rest on the water, but doth
not care much for diving; we shot one before
the <HI>Weibegat,</HI> on the 10th day of <HI>July.</HI> You see
him at <HI>c</HI> in the Tab. <HI>L.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>VI. Of the Rotges.</HEAD>
<P>This Bird is a Diver, and might be rather
called the <HI>Diving Rotge.</HI> His Bill is crooked,
but short, somewhat thick, of a black colour;
his Feet have but three Claws, with as many
black Nails, and are joyned by a black Skin;
his Legs are short and black; he is almost all
over black, except his Belly, which is white.</P>
<P>Some of this kind have their Wings spotted
with white and black, like the diving Pigeon;
no Water sticketh to their Feathers, no more
than to a Swans; they are most of them like
Hair on a very thick Skin: Their Tail is short.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="188"/>
They are very much like a Swallow in their
shape; I took them at first to be Swallows, for
they fly like them; they are in great flocks to∣gether,
as the Swallows are when they are
about to hide themselves against the Winter.</P>
<P>They go wabbling from side to side, as the
Divers do; they cry very loud <HI>Rottet, tet, tet,
tet, tet,</HI> at first high, and so by degrees lower
and lower; and this their calling or crying is
the occasion of their Name. They make more
noise than any other Bird, because their Voice
is shriller; but the <HI>Lumbs</HI> in this are not much
inferior to them, although they cry lower;
the Burgermeister, Rathsher, and the whole
crew of Birds of <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> strike in with
them, so that one can hardly hear another's
words.</P>
<P>The calling or crying of the Rotages amongst
one another sounds almost, at a distance, as if
you hear a great many Women scolding toge∣ther:
They are somewhat bigger than a Star∣ling.</P>
<P>They build their Nests in the Clifts of the
Rocks, yet not all of them, for some make their
Nests upon the Hills or Mountains, of Moss,
where we found them, and we killed abun∣dance
of their young ones with Sticks. They
feed upon the grey Worms that are like Craw∣fish,
which are delineated hereafter: They also
eat the red Shrimps or Prawns. We got the
first of them on the Ice on the 29th day of <HI>May,</HI>
and afterwards more of them by <HI>Spitzbergen.</HI></P>
<P>They are very good Food, and the best next

<HEAD>VII. Of the Struntjager (or Dung-hunter.)</HEAD>
<P>This Bird hath a Bill somewhat blunt be∣fore,
and crooked, and is thick; if I remem∣ber,
it is black.</P>
<P>He hath but three Claws, which are joyned
together with a black Skin; his Legs are not
very long; his Tayl, which is like unto a Fan,
hath this mark, that one Feather thereof stands
out before all the rest: He is black on the top
of his Head: His Eyes are black; about his
Neck he hath a dark yellowish Ring or Cricle;
his Wings, as well as his Back, are brown; un∣derneatsh
his Belly he is white; he is somewhat
bigger than the Mew called <HI>Kutge-gehef;</HI> he
hunts and flies in the Air after the Mew <HI>Kutge-gehef,</HI>
so long torments her, until she avoideth
her Dung, on which this Bird feeds, which he
catches dexterously before it falls down into
the Water; and this is the reason why they
call him <HI>Strunt-jager,</HI> in English the <HI>Dung∣hunter.</HI></P>
<P>He flyeth with the Mews called <HI>Kutge gehef,</HI>
which do not fear him in the least, and they
are both equally swift in their flying, but when
he intends to make them dung, he hunts them
and makes them cry out very loud, but he him∣self
seldom cries: He generally keepeth but to
one Mew, but if two or three of the Mews be
togher, and one makes her escape from him,
then he hunts the other two, and flyeth some∣times
above and sometimes underneath them.
I could never see him hunt after any other
Birds, but once I saw him fly after a Mallemunck,
but I saw him soon leave her, perhaps because
her Dung did not please him. I am of opinion
<PB N="88" REF="189"/>
that this Dung, because it is thin, serves him
instead of Drink, for else he eats the Fat of the
Whale for his Food: He builds his Nest not
very high.</P>
<P>He goes upright upon his Legs, like the <HI>Bur∣gemeister,
Rhatsher,</HI> or <HI>Kutge-gehef.</HI> It is a rare
Bird, and I saw but very few of them: He
flies commonly alone; I saw very seldom two
or three of them together; he flies like the <HI>Rhat∣sher,</HI>
or like a Crow, but his Wings are some∣what
more pointed at the ends.</P>
<P>He hath a loud Voice, when he cries it
sounds as if he did say, 1 <HI>Ja.</HI> To some it seem∣eth,
if it be at a distance, as if he cried, <HI>Jo han.</HI>
His Flesh is not better than that of the other
Birds of Prey. I got him on the 11th of <HI>July</HI>
near to the <HI>Dear-haven,</HI> or <HI>Dear-bay,</HI> in <HI>Spitzbur∣gen;</HI>

<HEAD>VIII. Of the Diving Parret.</HEAD>
<P>This is commonly called the <HI>Parret.</HI> Amongst
all the web-footed Birds that have three Claws,
this hath a peculiar Bill; and because it seem'd
to those that gave him this Name to be like
that of a Parret, therefore they called him also
a Parret; but in truth his Bill is not at all like
that of a Parret, its Bell is broad, and full of
slender strokes of several colours, <HI>viz.</HI> red,
white, and the broad part thereof is black;
the uppermost as well as the undremost are
both pointed; the uppermost arch is red, and
his upper Bill hath a thin bended Hook; the
undermost hath a yellowish arch, and is to∣wards
the end downwards cut off somewhat
<PB N="89" REF="189"/>
sloaping: The upper part of its Bill, as well as
the lower part, is about three fingers broad, and
about the same length, if you measure the upper
and undremost together: He hath of the up∣per
Bill four arched or bended oblong pitted
holes, and on the lower he hath as many, al∣though
the furthermost is not altogether so
plain.</P>
<P>These holes or pits of the upper and lower
Bill make together a Half-moon; and the parts
that are elevated make in the same manner, as
well as the pitted or hollow ones, a Half-moon.</P>
<P>By these holes are as many raised or eleva∣ted
parts; the uppermost of them is as broad
as the three furthermost ones together, and
hath underneath on each side a longish hole,
which without doubt are his Nostrils; but the
undermost on the under Bill is about a Straws
breadth broader; the upper broad part is
blackish, and sometimes blew.</P>
<P>On this broad part of the upper Bill that is
thus elevated above the rest, is towards the Eye
a long whitish piece of Cartilage that is full of
holes, whereon you see towards the inner part
of the Mouth something like a Nerve, which
also reacheth towards the under part, and there
endeth itself, whereby the Bill is opened and
shut.</P>
<P>His Feet have also but three Claws, joyned
with a red Skin between them, with three short
and strong Nails; the Legs are but short, and
of a red colour; he walks wabbling.</P>
<P>About his Eyes he hath a red ring, and above
this Ring stands upright a little Horn, and un∣derneath
the Eyes lyeth another little, longish,
black Horn cross over; as you may see in the
Figure.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="190"/>
His Tail is short: The Head is black at the
top unto the Horn; but his Cheeks are white;
about his Neck he hath a black Ring; all his
Back and Wings also, at the top or the outside,
are black, but underneath the Belly is white.
They fly either singly or by pairs, and have
sharp pointed Wings like the Lumbs. He will
keep a great while under Water. He eats like
the rest, red Shrimps or Prawns, and Star-fish,
for I found something in his Stomach that look∣eth
like pieces thereof, but they were almost
digested.</P>
<P>He hath more Flesh upon him than the di∣ving
Pigieon, and is very good to eat. I never
saw him among the Ice. This whereof I shew
you the draught was shot at <HI>Schmerenberg</HI> in
<HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> on the 20th day of <HI>June,</HI> but aftrer∣wards
we got several more. In the Tab. <HI>K</HI>

<HEAD>IX. of the Mountain-Duck.</HEAD>
<P>Hitherto we have described the web-footed
Birds that have three Claws that are not divi∣ded,
that I saw and got about <HI>Spitzbergen;</HI> I
must now describe those that have undivided
Feet with four Claws, whereof I found three
sorts, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Mountain-Duck, kirmew,</HI> and
<HI>Mallemucke.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Mountain-Duck</HI> is a kind of our wild
Duck, or rather wild Goose, for she is of the
bigness of a middling Goose, and is more like a
Goose about the Bill. It is a very handsom
Bird, because of its delicate spotted Feathers.
They dive under Water as other Ducks do.
The Drake hath black and white spotted Fea∣thers,
<PB N="91" REF="190"/>
and the Duck hath Feathers of the co∣lour
of a Partridge. The hindmost Claw is
broad and short, with a short Nail; the Tail
is bobb'd, like that of other Ducks. I could
find nothing in their Mews or Gizzards that
could make me certain of thier Food, but only
Sand-stones. They fly a great many of them
in flocks like other wild Ducks; when they
do see any Men, they hold up their Heads and
make a very long Neck. They make their
Nests upon the low Islands; they make them
of the Feathers of their Bellies, which they mix
with Moss; but these are not the same Feathers
which are called the Edder-down.</P>
<P>We found their Nests with two, three, or
four Eggs in them, the most whereof were rot∣ten
when we came to <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> but some of
them were good to eat; they are of a pale
green, somewhat bigger than our Duck-eggs;
the Seamen made an hole at each end, and so
blew the White and the Yolk out, and strung
the Shells upon a Packthread. I would have
brought some of them to <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> but they
began to stink, so that I was forced to fling
them away, although the Shells were entire.
These Ducks have a very good Flesh, we boyl'd
and rosted them as we did the other Birds,
but the fat of them we flung away, for it tasted
of Train-oyl, and made us vomit.</P>
<P>The Ships that arrived at <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> before
us got a great many of them.</P>
<P>These <HI>Mountain-Ducks</HI> are not at all shy, or
afraid of Men, when we first arrive there, but
afterwards they grow quite wild, so that you
can hardly come near enough to shoot them.
That which I have drawn here was shot in the

<HEAD>X. Of the Kirmew.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Kirmew</HI> hath a thin sharp-pointed Bill,
as red as Blood; the shews very large, especi∣ally
when she stands upright, because of her
long Wings, and Feathers of her Tail, but
when the Feathers are off, there is no more
Meat than upon a Sparrow. It is peculiar to
this Bird to have very sharp pointed Wings,
and its Tail is longer than that of a Swallow,
and as long as the longest Feather of the Wings.
Because of these long and sharp-pointed Fea∣thers
in her Wing and Tail, she might very
properly be called the <HI>Swallow-mew,</HI> but it is
commonly called <HI>Kirmew</HI> from its Cry. The
Claws, as well as the Skin between them, are as
red as Blood; the Nails are black on all the
four Claws; the hindmost Claw is very little:
The Legs are short and red: it shews very
brisk and pert when it stands upright on its
Legs. The Head at the top is black, like a
black Cap; the sides of the Head are Snow
white, and the whole Body is of a Silver co∣lour,
or white enclining to grey; the Wings
and Tail are white underneath; one side of the
Feathers of the Wings are black. All these
differing colours, together with the Blood-red
Bill, red Legs and Feet, make her very beauti∣ful
her Feathers are thready or hairy; she
flies singly, for so I saw her always in the <HI>South
Haven,</HI> and in other places where we were.
Where their Nests are they fly in great num∣bers;
These they make of Moss. One can hard∣ly
<PB N="93" REF="191"/>
discern their Eggs from their Nests, for both
of them are of a dirty white, but the Eggs have
black specks; they are of the bignest of a Pi∣geon's
Egg; I eat of them at <HI>Spttzbergen,</HI> and
found them very good, they tasted like the
Lapwings Eggs; the Yolk was red, and the
White blewish; they are very sharp-pointed at
one end. She defends her Nest and Eggs, and
flies directly at a Man, biting and crying. It is
the same with her as what we say of the Lap∣wing;
she endeavours to defend all the Mea∣dow,
and yet cannot defend her own Nest.</P>
<P>I brought about thirty of their Eggs with me
to <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> but they were rotten and stunk. It
is a kind of a Hawk, and throws herself into the
Water, as othe Mews do.</P>
<P>I am of an opinion, that she feeds on thee small
grey Worms, and perhaps on Shrimps and
Prawns, for I found no other Food they could
get.</P>
<P>I shot but one single Bird of them flying,
whitch I did not eat of, because the large shot
had torn it very much.</P>
<P>This Bird is quite grey in our Countries,
which differs much from that of <HI>Spizbergen,</HI>
whose Feathers are much finer. That here deli∣neated,
was shot, by the <HI>Birds Song</HI> in <HI>Spitzber∣gen,</HI>

<HEAD>XI. Of the Mallemucke.</HEAD>
<P>This Bird hath a remarkable Bill, which is
severally divided: The uppermost Bill hath
next to the Head oblong and small Nostrils;
underneath them groweth out as it was a new
Bill, that rises up, is crooked and very sharp∣pointed.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="192"/>
The under part of the Bill consists partly of
four pieces, two whereof meet in a point to∣gether
downwars, the other two gape upwards;
the two undermost that meet in a point, meet
exactly with the point of the upper Bill. The
hinder Claw of the Feet of this Bird is very
small, of a grey colour, and so are the other
Claws and the Skin between them. The Tail
is somewaht broad, the Wings are longish after
the manner of the <HI>Kirmew.</HI> They are not al∣ways
of the same colour; some are quite grey,
which we take to be the oldest, others are grey,
on their Back and Wings, but their Head and
Belly are white, which are the young ones:
This is generally thought, but I am of opinion,
that this difference of colour proceeds rather
form a difference in kind than from a difference
in age; for the grey ones I only saw about
<HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> but they grey and white ones, al∣though
I have seen some few of them at <HI>Spitz∣bergen,</HI>
yet we saw abundance more about the
<HI>North Cape,</HI> and Also about <HI>Hitland</HI> and <HI>England.</HI>
He flies like a great Mew, hovers near the
Water with a very small motion of his Wings.</P>
<P>They do not avoid a Strorm as our Mews do,
but they take good and bad together, as it hap∣pens;
ours bend themselves like an Ear of
Corn with the Wind, which the Mallemucks
do not: They do not much care for diving,
but when they wash themselves they sit upon
the Water, and put their Wings a-cross one over
the other: They fly singly; when they go to
fly up thye wabble a great way before they can
raise themselves upon the Wind, but the Lumbs
and Parrets that have but small Wings do it
more. When they ran upon the Deck of the
Ship, They could not fly up before they came
<PB N="95" REF="192"/>
to a place where a step went down, or from
some advantageous rise. They flock in great
numbers when we catch Whales, and light
down upon the live Whales, bite them in their
Backs, and pick out great pieces of his fat, even
when he is yet alive, and when we cut up the
dead Whales, there came so many of them
about us, that we could not imagine from
whence they could all come, so that we were
forced to kill them with Sticks and with broad
Nets in Frames, such as they use in the Tenis-Court,
to be rid of them: They are so bold,
that they would not fly away, although they
saw us caome upon them, but suffered them∣selves
to be killed in great numbers, which we
hung upon the Tackle of our Ship.</P>
<P>But after they began to be more shy of us,
and would not stay so long. They flock in so
great numbers after the Whales, that many of
them are discovered by them; wherefore I fan∣cy,
that he flings up some fat when he blows
the Water out, which the Mallemucks eat. But
a great many more, when the Whale is woun∣ded,
follow the bloody track left in ther Water,
for then they are numberless. They also often
discover a dead Whale, and so we get them
sometimes without any great trouble.</P>
<P>His Name is given him, because he is so silly
or mad (which the Dutch call <HI>Mall</HI>) to suffer
himself to be so easily killed, whereunto is put
the word <HI>Mucke,</HI> which signifies a Gnatt, be∣cause
they are as numerous as Gantts; so that
the Name <HI>Mallemucke</HI> signifieth as much as silly
Gnatts, or mad Gantts.</P>
<P>They eat so much of the fat of the Whales,
till they spew it up again, and tumble them
selves over and over in the water until they vo∣mit
<PB N="90" REF="193"/>
up the Train-oyl, and then they begin to
eat afresh, until they grow weary of eating:
They bite one another, and fight together,
which is very good sport, about a piece of Fat,
fiercely, although there is enough for them all,
and to spare.</P>
<P>When they are full they rest upon the Ice or
Water. I really believe it is the most devou∣ring
Bird of all, for he eats till he can stand no
longer, but falls down. He bites very hard,
but the Burgermeister bites yet harder, to
whom he submits himself, and lies down before
him to be bit by the Burgermeister, which he
does very severely, yet the Mallemucke feels
little or nothing of it, his Feathers are so thick;
which I conclude, because he is not easily shot,
but will endure a great blow; nor is it easie
to kill him with a Stick at one blow. When
they steer themselves in the Water with their
Legs, they have countinually an eye upon their
Prey, yet they mind both the Man and their
Prey; but if you have a long Stick, they can∣not
get up so soon or swift but you may have
a blow at them. He is the first and commonest
Bird of all you see in <HI>Greenland;</HI> they cry all
togehter, and it sounds afar off as if they were
Frogs. He walks but ill upon the Land and
Ice, like a Child that just learns to go, but
he understands better to fly; you see him
always near unto the surface of the Water, for
he is very light. Of all the Birds of Prey, I
believe, he hath the least Meat on him. He
builds his Nest high on the Mountains, yet not
so very high as the Bungermeister, yet it was
too high for me, I could not come at them.
His Breast and Legs only are to be eaten, they
are tough, and taste strong of Train oyl; when
<PB N="97" REF="193"/>
you will eat them you must hang them up by
the Legs, that the Fat of the Whales, or the
Train-oyl, may run out of them, for two or
three day, and that the Wind may blow thro'
them and the Frost pierce then also; them
you lay them into fresh Water, that the rank∣ness
may be drawn out, afterwards boil and
fry them in Butter. They are every where
seen in the North Sea, as I have said before,
yet they are differing. This that you see here
I did design among the Ice the first of <HI>June.</HI>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">of some other Birds that I did not
catch or delineate.</HEAD>
<P>AMongst these are the <HI>Red Gees,</HI> which were
shewn unto me as they were flying:
They are Geese with long Legs, that fly in
flocks; there is many of them in <HI>Russia, Nor∣way,</HI>
and <HI>Jutland.</HI></P>
<P>Then I saw another Bird flying singly with
broad Feet, a very handsom Bird, called <HI>John
of Ghent;</HI> it is as big as a Stork, and of the
same shape with white and black Feathers; he
hovers in the Air, and moveth his Wings but
very little; when he cometh to the Ice he
turns back again. It is a kind of a Hawk, and
I have reason to believe that he hath a very
sharp sight, for he shoots down from a great
height into the Water. They say, that the
Brains of this Bird are in great esteem, but for
what I could never learn.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="194"/>
He is also seen in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Sea, and every
where in the <HI>North</HI> Sea, but most commonly
he is seen where they catch Herrings.</P>
<P>I was also informed, that a black Crow was
seen in <HI>Spitzbergen;</HI> other Birds are not seen
there, except it may be now and then a single
one that strays and so cometh thither, as the
crow did. All these Birds come at certain
times, and abide at this place as long as the
Sun shines; afterwards, when the Cold begins
to encrease, and the Nights lengthen, every
one of them returns to its own place again.
When they are going from thence they gather
all together, and when they are all met they
<HI>fly away,</HI> every kind by themselves, which
hath been very often observed: Whence I con∣clude
they cannot live in this intolerable cold
place in the Winter. They rest as well upon
the Water as the Land, (and when they fly up
they look against the Wind) for else they
would quite be tired in this long <HI>Journey.</HI></P>
<P>Whether the Mew called <HI>Rathsher,</HI> that does
not love the Water, performs its Journey in
one day, I cannot tell; or whether Necessity
compels him to rest upon the Water.</P>
<P>Which way those Birds that have divided
Claws on their Feet, as the Snite, the Snow∣bird,
and the Ice-bird, get over the Water, I
know not.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Four-footed Creatures.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>I. Of the Hart or Deer.</HEAD>
<P>This is not very unlike unto the <HI>Hart,</HI> it
hath cloven Feet like it, and its Horns
are also like unto a <HI>Hart</HI> or <HI>Elke;</HI> they have
three or four branches on each side, which are
about two inches broad, and about a foot long;
their Ears are long, and Tail very short: He is
of a greyish yellow colour, like an <HI>Hart</HI> or <HI>Deer.</HI>
When they see a Man they run away; if you
stand still they stand also, then you must im∣mediately
fire at them if you have a mind to
hit them. They eat the Herbs and Grass.
They are every where about <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> but
above all in the <HI>Rene-field</HI> (or <HI>Deers-field)</HI> that
hath its Name from thence, where they'r very
plentiful, and also upon the <HI>Foreland</HI> near the
<HI>muscle haven.</HI> I never saw them swim in the
Water. As I was informed, some Men did kill
15 or 20 of them on the <HI>Vogel-song (Birds-song)</HI>
the meat thereof roasted is of a very pleasant
taste: We killed some of them presently, at our
first arrival in the Spring, that were very lean;
wherefore we may conclude, that they remain
in this barren and cold Country of <HI>Spitzbergen</HI>
all winter long, and are contented with what
they can get. See Tab. <HI>O,</HI> at <HI>a.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<PB N="100" REF="196"/>
<HEAD>II. Of the Fox.</HEAD>
<P>Between our Foxes and those of <HI>Spitzbergen</HI>
there is no great difference; one of them
I saw run by our Ship, very near it, his Head
was black and Body white: They make such
a noise, as afar off it sounds as if a Man laugh'd.
we saw them also run on the Ice. Their Food
falls but short there, they live upon Birds and
Eggs.</P>
<P>They go not at all into the Water; we
were hunting one of them in the <HI>South Haven,</HI>
and had surrounded him with twenty Men,
the Water was on one side of him, and we en∣deavoured
to drive him into it, but he would
not, but jumped through one Man's Legs, and
run up into the Mountains, where we could not
follow him.</P>
<P>The Ships Crew inform'd me, that when he
is hungry he lies down as if he was dead, until
the Birds fly to him to eat him, which by that
trick he catches and eats. But I believe that
this is a Fable. Tab. O, see <HI>b.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>III. Of the white Bear.</HEAD>
<P>These <HI>Bears</HI> are quite otherwise shaped than
those that are seen in our Country; they have
a long Head like unto a Dog, and a long Neck,
and they bark like Dogs that are hoarse, and
all their whole Body is much otherways shaped
than ours. They are slenderer in the Body,
and a great deal swifter.</P>
<P>Their Skins are brought to us, which are
very comfortable to those that travel in the
Winter; they prepare or dress the Skins at
<PB N="103" REF="196"/>
Coffins that are opened. They also eat Birds
and Eggs. We kill them with Guns, or any
other way we can. We caught three of them,
one whereof I drew after the life, on the 13th
of <HI>July.</HI></P>
<P>What becometh of these <HI>Bears</HI> and <HI>Foxes.</HI> in
the Winter-time I do not know, in the Summer
they have in some places, for a few months,
Provision enough, but in the Winter, when
the Rocks and Hills are covered with Snow,
there is but very little to be had for them; yet
being it is supposed that the Deer stay also
there all Winter long, I believe that these Beasts
do the same. Tab <HI>O,</HI> see <HI>e.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>IV. Of the Sea-dogs, called Rubbs and Seales.</HEAD>
<P>I have still two more Beasts to describe, that
live as well in the Water as on the Land and
Ice, and they have also on their Feet five Claws
like Fingers, that are joyned together with a
thick Skin, like unto the Feet of a Goose: The
most known of these is the Seale, which they
also call <HI>Salldogg</HI> and <HI>Rubbe,</HI> in the German
Language; the Head thereof is like unto a
Dog's Head, with cropt Ears: Their Heads
are not all alike, sor some are rounder, and
others longer or leaner: he hath a Beard about
his Mouth, and Hair on the Nose and the Eye∣lids,
yet seldom above four: the Eyes are very
large, hollow, and very clear: their Skin is
grown over with short Hair: they are of seve∣ral
colours, spotted like Tygers, some are black
with white spots, some yellow, some grey, and
others red: their Teeth are sharp like a Dogs,
wherewith he can bite off a Stick as thick as
ones Arm: On their Toes they have black,
<PB N="104" REF="197"/>
long, and sharp Nails or Claws; their Tail is
short; they bark like hoarse Dogs; their little
or young ones mew like Cats; they go lame
behind; they can climb upon the high Ice,
whereon I saw them sleep, chiefly when the
Sun shined, wherein they take great pleasure,
but when it is stormy weather they must march
off and leave it, for the Waves of the Sea beat
with great violence against it, as if it were
against Rocks, as I have mentioned already in
the Chapter of Ice.</P>
<P>We saw most of them upon the Ice about
the West side near to the shoar, where there
was an incredible number of them, that if the
Master of a Ship should not catch Whales
enough, they might lade their Ship with <HI>Seales</HI>
only; and we have Examples that little Ships
have taken their Lading only of them, but it is
very troublesome to flea them: Nor are they
all alike fat at the time when we arrive
there.</P>
<P>By <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> we see but a few of them, but
instead of them there is plenty of Sea-horses.
Where many <HI>Seales</HI> are seen, that is not a good
place to catch Whales in. It seemeth as if they
leave but very little for the Whale to live up∣on,
because there is so great a number of them.
They feed upon small Fishes, as far as I could
understand; we cut open several of them, and
found nothing in their Stomachs but great and
long whitish Worms of the thickness of ones
little Finger. We come up to them where they
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the large sheets of Ice; we make a
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with shouting, which astonisheth
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, or else out of novelty they hold
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Noses very high, and make a long
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Grey-hounds do, and bark: in
<PB N="101" REF="197"/>
<HI>Spitzbergen</HI> after this manner: They heat Saw∣dust,
and tread these Skins in it, which sucks
up the Fat, and the Skins become to be dry,
after the same manner as we use to take out
spots of Fat out of sine Linnen or other Clothes,
when we hold it against the Sun: They are of
the same bigness as ours, great and small:
Their Hair is long, and as soft as Wool: their
Nose and Mouth are black before, and their
Talons also black: The fat of their Feet mel∣ted
out, is used for pain of the Limbs; it is al∣so
given to Women in travail, to bring away
the Child; it causes also a plentiful Sweat.
The said Fat is very spongy, and feels very
soft; it is best to try it up there presently: I
strove to keep it until I should come home, but
it grew foul, rancid, and stinking. I believe
it would be very good to try it up with Orris∣root,
for then it would remain the longer good
and smell well.</P>
<P>The other is like Suet when it is tryed up, it
becometh thin like Train-oyl, or the fat
of Whales: But this is not to be compared to
the other for Vertue and Goodness, it is only
used in Lamps, where it does not stink so
much as the Train-oyl: The Skippers met it
out there, and bring it home with them to sell
it for Train-oyl. Their Flesh is whitish and
fat, like that of a Sheep, but I did not care to
try how it tasted, for I was afraid that my
Hair would turn grey before its time, for the
Seamen are of opinion, that if they eat of it,
it makes their Hair grey. They suckle their.
Young with their Milk, which is very white
and fat, as I observed, when we cut up an old
suckling She one. They say our Bears have a
very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ft Head, but I round the contary in
<PB N="102" REF="198"/>
these at <HI>Spitzbergen▪</HI> for we struck them with
large and thick Cudgels, upon their Heads,
with such blows that would have knock'd down
a Bullock, and yet they did not matter it at all.
When we had a mind to kill them, we were
forced to run them through with our Laun∣ces.</P>
<P>They swim from one sheet of Ice to the
other, they also dive under Water, when they
were at one side of our Long-boat, they did
dive, and came up again on the other. They
also run upon the Land. I did not hear them
roar so as ours do, but they only bark.</P>
<P>We could not discern the young ones from
the old ones, but only by the two furthermost
long Teeth, which in the young were hollow
within, but those of the old ones were close and
solid. If you burn their Teeth, and powder
them, and give them inwardly, it disperseth
coagulated Blood. The young ones keep con∣stantly
close to the old ones; we observed that
two young ones and an old one would not
leave one another, for if one ran away, it turn'd
back again immediately as soon as it did hear
the others, as if it would come to help
them. The old one run to the young one, and
the young one to the old one, and rather than
they would leave one another, they would suffer
themselves to be all killed.</P>
<P>They feed upon the Carcasses of Whales, and
near them we killed the most: They also eat
Men alive when they have an opportunity to
master them: They remove or roll away the
Stones of the burying places, open the Coffins,
and eat the dead Men, which many have seen,
and we can also conclude it from hence, be∣cause
we find the dead Mens Bones lye by the
<PB N="107" REF="198"/>
rest are the same, for when we thought that
they lay dead in our Long-boats, they snapt
about them, so that we were forced to kill
them.</P>
<P>For Sports sake I went once along with
them upon the Ice, and run one through the
Body with my Sword several times, which he
did not matter at all; I fell into the Snow up
to my Knees, and he barked at me, and offe∣red
to bite me, which I avoided, and when I
got up again I ran after him, and gave him se∣veral
wounds more, which he was not concer∣ned
at, but ran swifter than I could, and flung
himself off from the Ice into the Sea, and went
down to the bottom. Tab. <HI>P,</HI> see <HI>a.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>V. Of the Sea-horse, called by some the Morse.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Sea-horse</HI> is not unlike unto the <HI>Seale</HI> in
the shape of the Body, only is much bigger
than the other: He is as big as an Ox: Their
Legs are also like those of the <HI>Seale,</HI> for they
have five Claws as well on the fore as the hin∣der
Feet, but they have only short Nails: Their
Head is thicker, and rounder, and also much
stronger: Their Skin is an inch thick, chiefly
about the Neck, covered with short Mouse-coloured
Hair, some reddish, some grey, some
have but little Hair, and are mangy, and full
of Scarrs that are bitten, and look as if they
were flea'd; every where about their Joints
their Skin is full of Lines, as the inside of a
Man's Hand: They have two great and long
Teeth in their upper Jaw-bone, that hang
down below their under Lips, that are about
a foot and two foot long, sometimes they are
longer: The young ones have no great Teeth
<PB N="108" REF="199"/>
at all, but they grow in time as they grow ol∣der.
All the Sea-horses have two firm long
Teeth; yet I have seen old ones that had but
one; it may be that sometimes they loose them
when they fight, or otherwise they may fall
out of themselves, for I observed that some of
them had foul, hollow, rotten Teeth. These
two long Teeth are esteemed beyond Ivory,
because they are so very white, and are dearer;
they are close and firm within, and heavy, but
the Root thereof is hollow. Of their Teeth
are made Knife-hafts, Boxes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Jut∣landers</HI>
make Buttons for their Clothes of the
other Teeth. Their Mouth is very broad be∣fore,
like a Bullocks, whereon grow above and
underneath several Bristles that are hollow
within, and of the bigness of a Straw: Of
these Bristles the Seamen make Rings, which
they wear on their Fingers for the Cramp.
Above the uppermost Beard they have two
semicircular Nostrils, whereout he blows the
Water, like the Whale, yet with a less noise.
Their Eyes are at a good distance from the
Nose; they have Eyelids as other fourfooted
Beasts have; his Eyes are naturally as red as
Blood when he doth not turn them, and I
could see no difference when they were mo∣ved,
for they always turn'd their Eyes when
they did look upon me, and then they look
much uglier, though they are never handsom.
Their Ears are somewhat higher than the Eyes,
but very near to them, which are like those of
the <HI>Seales.</HI> Their Tongue is at least as big as a
Neat's, when it is but newly boiled it may be
eaten, but if it is laid by for two or three days,
it becomes rank, like Train-oyl. Their Neck
is very thick, wherefore he does not readily
<PB N="105" REF="199"/>
this fright of theirs we strike them with Half-pikes,
or long Poles upon their Noses, and
knock them down half dead, but for all that,
they recover themselves, and rise again: Some
of them stand upon their defence, bite at, and
run after the Men, and they run as fast as a
Man, and their lame way of going doth not
hinder them at all, for they shove themselves
along just like an Eel: Some run from the Ice
to the Water, and leave a yellow Dung behind
them, which they squirt out at their Hunters,
as the Hern does: They stink naturally abomi∣nably.
Others stand in the Water with half
their Belly, and look about them to see what
is done upon the Ice: When they are going to
dive under the Water, they hold up their No∣ses,
and make a long Neck: When they jump
from the Ice under Water, and also when they
make a dance of <HI>Seales,</HI> as they call it, about
the Ships, they constantly dive with their
Heads under water. They have their young
ones by them, one whereof we took away with
us to the Ship alive, but it would not eat any
thing, but did mew just like a Cat, and if we
touch'd him he would snap at us, so we killed
him. The biggest of them that I have seen
were from five to eight foot long, out of which
we cut so much fat, that we filled half a Bar∣rel
with it. He that I have drawn here was
eight foot long. Their Fat is about three or
four Fingers thick, it covers the Flesh just under
the Skin, and we do flea it off as a Skin: This
Fat yields the best Train-oyl; the Flesh is quite
black. They have abundance of Blood, as if
they were only filled up with it. They have
great Livers, Lungs, and Hearts, which we eat
after we have drawn out the rankness with
<PB N="106" REF="200"/>
Water, we boil them, but this Disn is very
loathsom, so that I could not eat it, it tasted so
of Train-oyl. He hath abundance of Guts,
which are very small: I found no Fat within
them; their parts of generation is a hard Bone,
like unto that of a Dog, about a span long, co∣vered
with Sinews; some were hardly so long
as your little finger, and yet they were not
young ones neither. The Crystal of their Eye
is not of the same colour always, for some were
like a Crystal, others white, others yellowish,
others reddish; they are bigger than a Pea; if
one will keep them he must let them dry gent∣ly,
or one may wrap them in Linnen Rags,
and so lay them in a moist place, for else they
fly or crack to pieces. I am informed, that
when they couple they are very fierce, so that
a Man dares not come near them upon the Ice,
then they bring their Long boats near the Ice,
and so kill them out of the Boats. They do
not quickly dye when the Blood is almost all
run out, after they have been mortally woun∣ded
and flea'd, they still live, and it looks ill to
see them tumble themselves about in their own
Blood. We had an Example of that in him
that was eight foot long, for when he was flea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,
and most of the Fat cut off, notwithstanding
all the blows he had had upon his Head and
Nose, he would still snap at us, and bite about
him, and took hold of a short Pike with his
Teeth after such a rate, as if nothing ailed him.
Then we run a short Pike through his very
Heart and Liver, and there ran out as much
Blood as if it had been a Bullock. The
Masters of the Ships will not suffer these nasty
doings in their Ships, for it fouls them mighti∣ly.
Not only this was so vivacious, but all the
<PB N="109" REF="200"/>
turn his Head about, and this is the reason why
he turneth his Eyes generally. Their Tails are
short, like those of the <HI>Seale.</HI></P>
<P>From their Flesh we cut no Fat, it is all
mixed together like unto Hogs-flesh, to which
it is the likest: Their Heart and Liver we did
eat; they taste well enough, chiefly where we
have no great variety of Dishes. Their Yards
are of a hard Bone, about two foot long, thick
at the bottom, and less before, somewhat bent
in the middle, at the side towards their Belly it
is flat, but it is round without, and it is every
where covered over with Sinews. They
turn also <HI>Knife hafts</HI> and other things out of this
Bone. What their Food is I cannot certainly
tell, they may perhaps eat both <HI>Herbs</HI> and
<HI>Fish;</HI> that they eat <HI>Herbs,</HI> I conclude from
hence, that their Dung looks like Horse-dung:
That they eat <HI>Fish</HI> I judge, because when we
cut the Fat off a Whale one of them did often
take the Skin with him under Water, he did al∣so
fling it up, and catch it again. The <HI>Burger∣meister</HI>
doth eat his Dung, as is said before when
I writ of the Birds. The <HI>Sea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>horses</HI> keep gene∣rally
about <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> for amongst the Ice-hills
I saw none. They lay upon the Ice, as I
have already mentioned in the First Part, by
the 12th of <HI>July</HI> very nastily, as the <HI>Seales</HI> in
great numbers, and roar most terribly. They
dive with their Head under the Water before,
like the <HI>Seales.</HI> They sleep and snore, not on∣ly
upon the Ice, but also in the Water, so that
we take them several times for dead ones.</P>
<P>They are very stout and unda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nted Crea∣tures,
they stand by one another as long as
they have Life, and if any of them be wounded
they make to the Long-boat, notwithstanding
<PB N="110" REF="201"/>
that the Men strike, and cut, and push at them▪
some will dive under the Water near unto the
Long-boats, and cut holes in them with their
great Teeth under Water; and others without
any fear at all make to the Boat, and stand up
with half their Body out of the Water, and
endeavour to get into the Boat.</P>
<P>In such a Battel a Sea-horse did once strike
with his <HI>Teeth</HI> or <HI>Tushes</HI> into the Boat, and took
hold of our Harponier with his long Tooth,
between his Shirt and the Wastband of his
Breeches, so that the Wastband broke, other∣wise
he had pulled him under Water.</P>
<P>When they roar, if they are imitated, they
strive which shall get underneath the Water,
and fall a fighting and biting one another till
they fetch Blood: Others strive to set at liberty
the Sea-horses taken by the Men, striving before
each other to get to the Boat, biting and g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ash∣ing
with their Teeth, and roaring terribly:
They never give over so long as one of them
is alive, and if you are forced to fly, because
of their unspeakable number, they will follow
the Boat till you lose them out of sight, for
they cannot follow far, their great number hin∣dring
one another. This we found by <HI>Weiheg at</HI>
by <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> where they got together in
great numbers, and made our Boat take in
Water, so that we were forced to flee, yet they
followed us as long as we could see them, on
the 12th day of <HI>July.</HI> We take them only for
their Teeth: You shall see almost a hundred
of them before you find one that hath good
Teeth, for some of them are but small, others
have but one, and others none at all.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="201"/>
I saw one in the <HI>English Haven</HI> lying on a
sheet of Ice, at first we took him to be a <HI>Seale,</HI>
but we found it was an old, bald, and mangy
<HI>Sea-horse.</HI> We gave him some blows, which
he took, and dived under Water. When they
see them lye upon the Ice, or hear them roar,
they row with their Boats to them, where they
lye in great numbers, but I believe one of them
keeps watch, for I have several times observed
that one of them did strike him that was next
to him with his Tooth, and so it went on:
When they awake they rise up and stand upon
their fore-foot, look terribly, and roar, and
strike with their long Teeth into the Ice for
madness, and so draw themselves along by the
help thereof, when they run apace, or climb
upon the Ice, as the <HI>Seales</HI> do. Their greatest
strength lyeth in their Head, and their Skin is
thickest about the Neck, it is thicker than that
of an Elk, and it is also a great deal firmer;
wherefore if they were dressed like an Elk's
Skin, they would serve instead of the best Buff∣coat.
When great multitudes of them lye up∣on
a sheet of Ice, and they do awake and fling
themselves into the Sea, you must keep off your
Boat at a distance from the Ice, until the grea∣ter
part of them are got off, for else they would
jump into the Boat to you, and overset it,
whereof many Instances have been; then the
Harponier runs after them on the Ice, or he
darts his Harpon out of the Boat at the <HI>Sea∣horse,</HI>
who runs on a little until he is tired, then
the Men draw on the Rope or Line again, and
fetch him to the Boat, where he begins to resist
to his utmost, biting and jumping out of the
Water, and the Harponier runs his Launce in∣to
him till he is killed. When they dart the
<PB N="112" REF="202"/>
Harpoon at them, they always take the oppor∣tunity
to do it when he is precipitating himself
from the Ice, or when he diveth with his Head
under Water, for then his Skin is smooth and
extended, and therefore the Harpoon striketh
through the Skin on his Back the better; but
when he lyeth and sleepeth his Skin is loose and
wrinkled, so that the Harpoon does not pierce
the Skin, but falls off. The Harpoon for a
<HI>Sea-horse</HI> and the Launce also are short, of the
length of one span, or one and a half, and an
inch thick, and the wooden Staff thereof is
about six foot long; the Harpoon for a Whale
is much took weak to pierce his thick Skin
withal, yet both of them are very well tem∣per'd,
and of good tough Iron, and not much
hardened. When the <HI>Sea-horse</HI> is killed, they
take his Head only and leave the rest, this they
carry on board, where they cut out the Teeth;
the two great ones belong to the Owners or
Merchants of the Ship, but the small Teeth are
not esteem'd. I cannot but mention that we
went by a Field of Ice, where so many <HI>Sea-horses</HI>
lay that the weight of them made the
Ice even with the Water, but when they were
jumped off into the Sea, we could hardly step
out of our Boat upon it, so high was it risen
out of the Water. It was related to me, by
them that used this <HI>Greenland</HI> Trade every Year,
as a certain Truth, that once when they had
no good fortune to catch Whales, they rowed
with their Boats to the <HI>Mufs Island,</HI> which was
full of <HI>Sea-horses,</HI> they ventur'd upon them
couragiously with cutting, striking, pushing,
and shooting, so that they killed a very great
many of them; but when they saw that still
more and more of them got together, they laid

the dead <HI>Sea-horses</HI> round about them, and stood
in the middle of them, as in a Castle, leaving a
place open where the others might come in to
them, as through a Gate; and after this man∣ner
they have killed several hundreds of them,
and made a good Voyage of it, for some years
ago their Teeth have been in greater esteem
than now. The Figure of this Beast you may

<HEAD>I. Of the Sea Crawfish without a Tail, or
Sea Spider.</HEAD>
<P>This sort of <HI>Crawfish</HI> has no Tail, but six Feet
and two Claws. They are else very like Lob∣sters
in the shape of their Body. They are of a
dark brownish colour, somewhat prickly on
their Backs, and hairy all over their Body. I
have seen many of this kind with six Feet and
<PB N="114" REF="205"/>
two Claws, in my Voyage to <HI>Spain,</HI> whereof
I have also made a draught in my Voyage into
<HI>Spain,</HI> (which I shall, God willing, communi∣cate
to the Curious) but they differ form these
of <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> in their Bigness and Head; this
of <HI>Spizbergen</HI> hath a Head like a Lobster, but
the male of them that I saw in my Voyage to
<HI>Spain,</HI> made with its Head and Tail just the
shape of a Lute. I did not eat any of the
<HI>Spitzbergen Sea Crawfish,</HI> neither have I drawn
them at <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> for want of time, for I
thought to have them brought along with me,
but they were carried away by the Rats. I got
them in the <HI>English Haven,</HI> on the 19th of <HI>June,</HI>
I afterwards saw them in the North Sea, not
far from <HI>England,</HI> where we bought from the
<HI>Hilgeland-</HI> Fishermen a great Tarbut, in whose
Stomach we found a Sea Crawfish two spans
long when its Feet were spread out.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>II. Of the Garnels or Prawns.</HEAD>
<P>Betwixt our <HI>Prawns</HI> and those of <HI>Spitzbergen.</HI>
is no difference, only that those of <HI>Spitzbergen</HI>
are red before they are boiled. Their Head is
peculiar, consisting of two parts, with several
Horns; the whole Head is broad, at the end
of the Head are the Eyes, which stand out as
Crawfishes do; he doth not look downwards,
but streight before, and sidewards. The Scale
of his Back is like a Back-piece of Armour,
which also behind the Head, in his Neck, is
somewhat bended in, and behind it, is a Prickle.
After that follow six Plates, like the Armour for
the Arms and Legs, and about the brims there∣of
are small black spots, as if they were the Nails
of the Armour. These Plates lye exactly round
<PB N="115" REF="205"/>
one upon the other. The Tall consisteth also
of five parts; when he expands it, it is like the
Tail of a Bird. He hath two Claws before,
the further part whereof looks somewhat like
the Phangs of a Tooth-drawer. He hath 18
Legs, wherof those that are nearest to the
Claws are the shortest. The first eight Legs
have four Joints, whereof the uppermost is the
longest, and the undermost the shortest: They
are not hairy at all. The ten hindmost Legs,
whereof the furthermost are the longest, and
the uppermost Joint is much thicker and shor∣ter
than the lowermost long ones have but
two Joints, the Feet whereof are somewhat
bended under, and are hairy. On these hind∣most
and undermost Joints grow out two shoots
below, on the rest but one. He shoots very
swiftly along in the Water. He was as big as
I have delineated him, according to the Life.
They are Food for the Birds, as I have men∣tioned
before.</P>

<P>I have also taken notice, in my Voyage to
<HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> a sort of <HI>Shrimps</HI> that are like
Worms; the Head thereof is like the Head of
a Fly; it hath on the foremost part of its Head
two Horns standing out; it hath Scales like the
<HI>Hog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>louse;</HI> its Back is round, and broad down∣wards;
it hath 12 Legs; on each side of the

side three Legs more; they are no bigger than
I have drawn them. The Birds eat them as
their best Food, being always in great numbers
in those places where these Worms were. I
<PB N="116" REF="206"/>
found great plenty of them in the <HI>Danish</HI> Har∣bour;
between and underneath the Stones in
the Water; afterwards on the Eighth of <HI>July</HI> I
found them in the <HI>Mussel-haven.</HI> I have also
found them in the Seed of the Whales that swam
upon the Water. See <HI>c</HI> in the Tab. <HI>P.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>IV. Of the Louse of the Whale.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Whale's Louse</HI> hath no resemblance at all
to our Lice, except in the Head, and therefore
it belongs rather to the Crustaceous Animals.
Their Scales are as hard as those of the Prawns.
They have a Head like a Louse, with 4 Horns;
the two short Horns that stand out before have
two knobs, like Kettledrum-sticks; the two other
bended Horns are sharp before. Its Head hath
almost th shape of an Acorn, is cut very deep
behind. It hath two Eyes, and but one No∣stril.
The Neck is not made of stiff Scales, but
its Skin is like that between two Scales or
Plates of a Lobster. It hath six Plates on the
Back; the foremost of them is shaped like a
Weaver's Shutle. The Tail might be compa∣red
unto a Shield, but it is very short. On the
foremost Plate it hath Feet shaped like a Sythe;
they are round before, and bent, like the first
Quarter of the Moon; but on the inside they
are toothed like a Saw, and at the end thereof
there is a sharp point: On each side of the se∣cond
and third Plait grow out four <HI>Legs</HI> that
are his Oars; they have a short Joint below,
wherein these Oars are moved; these they lay
in a cross one over the other, upon their Back,
when they feed upon the Whale; or they put
them upwards together, as the Vaulters do when
they jump over Swords: The six hindmost
<PB N="117" REF="206"/>
Legs are like those of a <HI>Crawfish;</HI> they have
three Joints on each Leg, the foremost where∣of
are crooked like a Half-moon, but before,
or on their ends they are very sharp pointed,
so that they can take firm hold as well of the
Skin of Men as of that of the Whale, so that
you must cut them in pieces before you can
pull them from the Skin. He that will have
them alive, must cut the Skin of the Whale out
with them. They sit on certain places of the
Whale's Body (as between his Finns, on his <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣denda,</HI>
and on his Lips) where he cannot easily
rub himself, and bite pieces out of his Skin, as
if the Birds had eaten him.</P>
<P>Some Whales are full of Lice, and others have
never a one: The warmer the Weather is, the
more Lice they get, as I am informed. The
Figure, that I give you here I delineated in the
<HI>Mussel-haven,</HI> on the 7th of <HI>July.</HI> See Tab. <HI>Q</HI>
at <HI>d.</HI></P>

<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>V. Of the Star-fish.</HEAD>
<P>I have seen but two sorts of these in my
Voyage, the first of them hath five Points or
Rays like Legs; it is quite otherwise shaped
than those that I have seen in the <HI>North, Spa∣nish,</HI>
and <HI>Mediterranean Seas.</HI> It is of a red co∣lour:
Above, upon the plain of its Body it
hath five double rows of sharp knobs or grains;
between each of these double rows is a Tingle
row of the some knobs, so that in all there is
15 rows of knobs on the whole plain. These
15 rows together make a Star of five outward
bended points.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="207"/>
As for the rest, this Plain looketh like the
Back of a Spider, but if he is turned he looketh
neatly, and in this posture is seen in the middle
a five-corner'd plain Star, which I take to be
its Mouth, which he can open and draw toge∣ther
like a Purse. Round about this Star are
small black Spots, in rows, of the shape of a Star.
Further forwards, about the middle Star or his
Mouth a broader one is, like unto the Flower
of the Crowsfoot. From the middle Star pro∣ceed
five Legs or Arms, which have no knobs
where they begin, but begin first to have some
behind the Flower like shaped Star, on both
sides to the end. The knobs between the Legs
are soft to the touch, like the Skin of an Egg.
Their Legs are scaley, about three fingers
breadth long, broader at their beginning, where
they have knobs, and afterwards by degrees
they grow narrower. Between the Scales on
both sides the Knobs come out commonly
three or four together, and look like Warts.
When he swims in the Water he spreads out
these Knobs on each side, just as a Bird doth his
Feathers when it is going to fly. See Tab. <HI>P▪</HI>
at <HI>d.</HI></P>
<DIV4 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Of the Second Starfish.</HEAD>
<P>Besides this, another fine <HI>Starfish</HI> came to my
Hands, which rather ought to be called the
Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alfish, because he is like Twigs of Coral, for
which I took them also, before I perceived that
he was alive. This is of a brighter colour than
the other, for the other is dark<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red. Its Body
hath ten corners, and it hath a Star above with
as many Rays; each of these one may compare
<PB N="119" REF="207"/>
unto a Sail of the Windmills that the Children
run against the Wind withal, or to a piece of
such Crosses that are broad before, and narrow
where they meet together; that is to say, of the
shape of a Dove-tail: It feeleth rough: The
lower part of the Body is very neat; in the
middle thereof is a Star with six points, which
I take to be his Mouth: About the Mouth he
is soft, to the place where his Legs begin: Be∣tween
the beginning of his Legs he had soft
Cavities. His Legs are where they begin thick,
and have in the middle a longish hollow or
gutter, which feeleth soft; on the Brim they
are adorned with Scales that lye one over the
other, no otherwise than if they were a row of
Coral, but underneath the Scales are twisted,
and have in the middle forwards small black
Strokes, but the Scales lye over one another
like unto the Plaits of the <HI>Crawfish:</HI> Besides,
where the Legs come out of the Body, they
spread themselves double into Twigs, and are,
as is said before, hollow in the middle, until
the place where they divide themselves into se∣veral
Branches, and so grow slenderer by de∣grees.
The undermost small Branches are sca∣ley
all round, but not twisted like Ropes;
they are sharp pointed on their ends like unto
the Feet of a Spider, wherefore the Seamen call
them Sea-spiders. When they swim in the
Water they hold their Legs together, and so
they row along. I had one of this sort that
was a span long, from the extremity of one
Foot to the other; but this I have delineated
is less. The biggest are the handsomost for
colour. They dye soon after they are out of
the Water, and when they are a dying they
bend their Legs towards the Mouth. The
<PB N="120" REF="208"/>
Body, when it is dead, soon breaks to pieces,
which is the reason that I could not keep the
great ones. See Tab <HI>P,</HI> at <HI>e. Rondeletius,</HI> in
his Book of Fish, hath delineated one of
the same shape, but this is not the same species,
for his is black; neither do I find the Plaits in
his, except he that drew it did not observe
them. Some of both these sorts I got on the
fifth of <HI>July,</HI> before the <HI>Weihegat,</HI> where a
Whale made his escape from us, because the
Line whereunto the Harpoon was fasten'd was
entangled about a Rock: On this they hung,
and so I got them alive.</P>

<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore I come to treat of the Whale, I think
it convenient to say something of some
Finn'd Fishes, which I met withal in my Voy∣age
to <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> some whereof are propaga∣ted
by the shooting of their Row, and others
bear and bring forth young ones alive.</P>
<P>I will begin with the First kind, whereof the
first that I met withal was the Fish that we call
<HI>Macarel.</HI></P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>I. Of the Macarel.</HEAD>
<P>This Fish is like unto a <HI>Herring</HI> in his shape,
but hath on his Back a large Finn, and some∣what
below it a very small one. Then lower
there is another greater and broader one, but
<PB N="121" REF="208"/>
not so high as the uppermost: Underneath this
are five small ones, that are all of the same big∣ness,
and at an equal distance one from ano∣ther.
Very near to the Tail there is another
less one; so that on the whole Back there is
two great ones, and seven little ones. Near
unto the Gills is a Finn on each side: under∣neath
the Belly there are again on each side
one almost of the same bigness of that that is
near to the Gills. Underneath towards the
Tail is one of the same bigness of the third on
the Back. Behind this there are again five of
an equal bigness; and below that still a less one;
so that those of the lower part of the Back are
equal to those of the lower part of the Belly.
Their Head is like unto that of a <HI>Herring.</HI> He hath
a great many small holes on the Cover of his
Gills, and also underneath the Eyes. They
have a great variety of colours, that look more
glorious when they are alive than when they
are dead, for when they are a dying the colours
fade and grow pale. From his Back towards
the Side he hath black Stroaks. The upper∣most
part of his Back is blew till to the mid∣le,
and the other half underneath it is green,
and as if some blew did shine through it. Un∣derneath
his Belly he is as white as Silver, and
his Finns are white every where. All the co∣lours
of this Fish shine like to a Silver or Gol∣den
Ground, done over with thin, transparent
or illuminating colours. Their Eyes are black.
It is the beautifulest Fish of all that ever I saw.
This that I describe here was catched in the
North Sea; afterwards, on the 27th day of
<HI>June,</HI> in the Year 1673. we did catch some
Macarels behind <HI>Scotland,</HI> by the Island of
<HI>St. Kilda,</HI> which were half blind; it is occasio∣ned
<PB N="122" REF="209"/>
by a black Skin that groweth over their
Eyes in the Winter, and cometh off again in
the beginning of the Summer. We do not see
them in the Winter, for they run towards the
North: In the Summer we see them in the
North Sea, and I have seen them also in <HI>Spain.</HI>
We caught them after the following manner;
we fastened a Bullet that weighed about two
or three pounds to a Line, about a Fathom di∣stance
from the end, whereon we had fastened
a Hook; this Hook we baited with a piece of
a red Cloth, and so we flung it into the Sea,
and towed it behind our Ship, then when the
<HI>Macarel</HI> doth <HI>swiftly shoot</HI> at it, he bites
upon the Hook, and so is hung, which you
presently, perceive by its pulling, as you do
when you catch any other Fish, notwithstand∣ing
that the Rope of its own accord doth pull
or draw very hard, by reason of the Sea, so
that if you should rowl it about your Hand, it
would benumb your Hand in a little time to
that degree, that you would not be sensible, if
one should cut it; wherefore they tye their
Ropes to the carved Work on the Stern of the
Ship, so that sometimes many of them are tyed
to the Ship by one another, when the Ship
sails apace, but this doth hinder the Ship very
much in its sailing, and I dare say two such
Ropes draw as much as a Man's Strength.
They catch them also with <HI>Herring,</HI> with a piece
whereof they bait the Hook, at which they
bite sooner than at a red piece of Rag of Cloth.
They eat best if you boil, or broil, or roast
them fresh as they are caught, or dry them:
They are hard to be digested.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<PB N="123" REF="209"/>
<HEAD>II. Of the Dragon-fish.</HEAD>
<P>It is peculiar to this Fish to have two Finns
on his Back, the foremost whereof hath very
long Strings, about two inches high above the
Back, the hindmost Finn of the Back is not
so high, but yet it goeth a great way all along
the Back and hath no such Strings. He hath
no Gills, in the room of them he hath two
blowing holes in his Neck, and on each side of
these holes there are two short Finns, and un∣derneath
these, on each side a broad one: Un∣derneath
his Belly he hath a long very narrow
Finn, that reaches to the Tail. His Head is
oblong, composed of many Bones: He hath
before on his Nose a raised part: His Tail is
about an inch broad: His Body is long, thin,
and roundish, of a greyish Silver colour, and
shining: His Shape is likest to that of a young
Hay, as well the Head as the rest of the Body.
They are caught between the <HI>Bears-Island</HI> and
<HI>Spitzbergen.</HI> We got one off of <HI>Hitland,</HI> when
our Cook flung out his Bucket for Water, in
which he took up one with some small Fish
of the shape of an <HI>Herring,</HI> but they were not
bigger than a joint of your little Finger. Our
Seamen informed me of some other small Fish,
that are in the deep holes between the high
Mountains, in the <HI>South Haven.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>III. Of the Dolphin.</HEAD>
<P>This is also a common Fish, because we see
them in great numbers, every where in the Sea,
chiefly before a Storm or hard Weather, for
then they jump in great numbers out of the Sea,
<PB N="124" REF="210"/>
like <HI>Seales.</HI> The Head of it, chiefly the Nose,
is very like that of the <HI>Place</HI>'s Head Its Mouth is
full of little sharp Teeth. He hath a Finn on
the middle of his Back, which is hollowed out
towards the Tail, like an Half-moon. On its
Belly are two Finns, like those of the Whale;
these Finns are not like them of small or little
Fishes, that are boney, joined together with a
thin Skin, but they are all over fleshy, and co∣vered
with a thick Skin, and made of jointed
Bones within. The Tail is broad, and of the
same shape as that of the Whale, but it is not
cut in, and is crooked from one end to the
other, like a Sickle. He hath two small round
Eyes. The greatest part of the Body is of a
black colour, but the Belly is white; they are
five or six feet long. They run very swift
against the Wind, as an Arrow: They are ge∣nerally
caught by chance. Because Figures
thereof are in other Books, I did not think it
convenient ot delineate him.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>IV. Of the Butskopf, or Place's Head.</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Butskopf</HI>'s Head is blunt before, where∣on
is a Bill or Beak of an equal bigness all-along,
which distinguishes him from the <HI>Dolphin,</HI>
which is thicker behind, and more pointed be∣fore.
The Finns are like those of the <HI>Dolphin,</HI>
but the foremost on his Belly are liker those of
the Whale; its Tail is also liker a Whale's. He
hath a <HI>Spout-hole</HI> above in his Nekh, whereout
he spouts the Water, but not with such a
strenght, nor so high as a Whale doth. There
is also a difference in the sound of the Fishes,
for this, when he bloweth out Water, makes
but a small noise, but the blowing of a Whale
<PB N="125" REF="210"/>
roareth that you may hear it afar off. His Eyes
are very small in proportion to his bigness. I
have seen them sixteen, eighteen, and some∣times
twenty foot long. Their Back is of a
brown colour; the Head brown and marbled;
underneath their Belly they are white. They
run very near unto the Ships, so that one may
push at them with a Stick, and they keep up
with a Ship for a long time, which other Fishes
do not, for when they see the Ships they are
afraid of them. They all swin against the
Wind, as <HI>Whales, Finn-fish,</HI> and <HI>Dolphins.</HI> I am
of opinion, that they endeavour to run away
from the storm, and that they find some Pain
or other in their Bodies some days before, for
you shall see some Fish tumble about strangely
in the Water, which I do not take to be play∣ing,
and this generally continues until their
Tormenter the <HI>East Wind</HI> ceases. We saw ano∣ther
sort of great Fishes, that might rightly be
called <HI>Butskopf,</HI> for their Head is quite blunt
before, and have a Finn that stands up three
times higher than the other <HI>Butskopf</HI> has; they
are somewhat of a darker brown colour, but of
the same bigness. We saw them tumble seve∣ral
times out of the Water; one might easily
take them, because of their high Finn that
stands on the top of their Back. They are not
<HI>Sword-fish,</HI> nor of the same kind we call <HI>Tum∣blers,</HI>
which we see between the <HI>Elbe</HI> and the
<HI>Hilgeland.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>V. Of the White fish.</HEAD>
<P>I do not by this Name mean the Fish we
call so here in our Country, that are but small,
but I mean a bigger<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sort, as large as a <HI>Butskopf,</HI>
<PB N="126" REF="211"/>
in shape like a Whale, and without Finns on
his Back; he hath two Finns on his Belly, as
I am informed by others that have caught them.
The Tail is like unto a Whale's. He hath a
<HI>Spout hole</HI> on his Head; he hath also an Hoffel
on his Head like a Whale. He is of yellowish
white colour. He hath fat enough in propor∣tion
to his bigness; I was told by them that
had caught one, that they did fill a Barrel of
Fat from one; but this Fat is very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and the
Harpoon easily breaks out, wherefore they do
not care to catch them. When we see plenty
of them, the Skippers say, it is a sign of a good
year for catching of Whales; for, if these find
good Food, the Whales find the same also. We
saw on the 19th of <HI>June</HI> some hundreds of
them.</P>

<P>The <HI>Unicorn</HI> is but seldom seen in these parts,
neither had I the good Fortune to meet with
one in all my Voyage; and yet sometimes ma∣ny
of them are seen. I do not find that the
Cuts that I have seen in some Books agree with
the description that I heard thereof; for I was
informed, that he hath no Finn on his Back, as
he is drawn, he hath also a <HI>Spout-hole</HI> in his
Neck. When they swim swiftly in the Water
they say that they hold up their Horns, or ra∣ther
Teeth, out of the Water, and so go in
great shoals. The Shape of their Body is like
a <HI>Seal;</HI> the undermost Finns, and the Tail, are
like unto those of the Whale. The Skin of
some of them is black, some like a grey dapled
Horse; underneath their Belly they are white▪

<P>This Fish hath his Name from a Saw, which
is a long broad Bone fixed to his Nose, that hath

like a Comb. He hath two Finns on his Back,
the uppermost of them is like the <HI>Butskopf</HI>'s,
the undermost hath behind, towards the Tail a

shorter, and narrower; they stand directly un∣derneath

The Tail is like unto a piece of Board, where∣on

which is pointed behind and underneath. The
Tail is not divided, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Towards the under∣most
Finn of the Back the Tail is thinner.
The other shape, from the top to the Tail, is
like a Man's naked Arm. The Nostrils are
oblong. The Eyes stand high out of his Head.
Their Mouths are just directly underneath the
Eyes. They are in bigness from two to twenty
foot.</P>
<P>These <HI>Saw</HI> or <HI>Sword-fish</HI> are great Enemies to
the <HI>Whale</HI> and <HI>Finn-fish.</HI> Many of them gather
about him, and they do not leave the <HI>Whale</HI> un∣til
they have killed him, then they eat of him
only the Tongue, all the rest they leave behind
them, as doth appear by the <HI>Whales</HI> that are
killed by the <HI>Sword-fish.</HI> I saw my self, in our
Home-voyage or Return, a Fight between a
<PB N="128" REF="212"/>
<HI>Whale</HI> and a <HI>Sword-fish,</HI> where both of them
made a great bustle, beating and jumping
about; and I understood that in calm Weather
the Seamen let them alone until the <HI>Whale</HI> be
killed, where they take him without any trou∣ble.
But if they set out their Long boats after
the <HI>Whale,</HI> they frighten the <HI>Sword-fish,</HI> and so
the <HI>Whale</HI> escapes.</P>

<HEAD>VIII. Of the Hay.</HEAD>
<P>There are several sorts of them; they have
two Finns on their Backs, the highest whereof
is like to the uppermost of the <HI>Butskopf,</HI> but the
lowermost is of an equal breadth at the top and
bottom, but it is hollowed out like a Sickle:
He hath six Finns underneath his Belly, where∣of
the foremost two are the longest, and shaped
like a Tongue, but the two middlemost are
somewhat broader than those towards the Tail,
and of the same shape; the two last underneath
by the Tail are of an equal breadth from top to
bottom, something shorter than the middle
ones. The Tail is of a peculiar shape, like un∣to
one half part of that of the <HI>Sword-fish,</HI> but it
is split below; and the other part is like a Leaf
of a Lilly. He hath a long Nose. The whole
Fish is long, round, and thin, and he is thickest
towards the Head: his Mouth is shap'd as that
of the <HI>Sword-fish;</HI> it is full of sharp Teeth, three
upper and three under rows, one by the other:
his Eyes stand something more out before than
behind, after the same fashion as those of the
<HI>Sword-fish,</HI> they are oblong, and very clear: he
hath five Gills on each side, as the <HI>Sword-fish:</HI>
his Skin is hard and thick, and rough if you
touch it or strike it upwards; it is of a greyish
<PB N="129" REF="212"/>
colour; they are from one fathom long to
three: It is a very devouring Fish, and bites
great pieces form the <HI>Whale,</HI> as if they had been
dug out with Shovels. They devour of many
<HI>Whales,</HI> all the Fat underneath the Water, and
this is the reason that the Seamen say, <HI>They
have caught half a Whale that was dead.</HI> And
the Birds do help them also, and what is not ta∣ken
away underneath, ferments out at the top.
They have a large Liver, whereof they make
Oyl. Out of their Backs we cut the Flesh, which
we hang up for some days in the open Air,
then we boil and roast it, and this tasts very
well, when we have nothing that is better.
They do not fling away the <HI>Hays</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> but
sell them: The little ones are the best. They
are very eager after Man's Flesh, and eat many
a Man that goeth to swim or wash in the Sea,
whereof we have many Instances. They are
easily caught after the following manner; we
take a great Hook fastned to a strong Iron
Chain, baited with a piece of Flesh, and let it
hang down into the Sea; the <HI>Hay</HI> as soon as he
doth perceive it, snaps at it, and is catch'd;
but when the <HI>Hay,</HI> perceives that he is fast, he
doth use his utmost endeavour to bite off the
Hook, which he cannot for the Iron.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Whale.</HEAD>
<P>THE Fish properly called the <HI>Whale,</HI> for
whose sake our Ships chiefly undertake
the Voyage to <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> is differing from
other <HI>Whales</HI> in his Finns and Mouth, which is
without Teeth, but instead thereof long, black,
somewhat broad, and horny Flakes, all jagged
like Hairs: he differs from the Finn-fish in his
Finns, for the Finn-fish hath a great Finn on
his Back, but the Whale, properly so called,
hath none on his Back; and there is two Finns
behind his Eyes of a bigness proportionable to
the Whale, covered with a thick black Skin,
delicately marbled with white Strokes, or as
you see in Marble, Trees, Houses, or the like
things represented. In the Tail of one of the
Fishes was marbled very delicately this number
1222 very even and exact, as if they had been
painted upon it on purpose. This marbling
on the Whale is like Veins in a piece of Wood,
that run streight through, or else round about
the center or pith of a Tree; and so go both
white and yellow strokes through the thick and
the thin strokes, that is like Parchment or
Vellam, and give to the Whale an incompara∣ble
Beauty and Ornament. When these Finns
are cut up, you find underneath the thick Skin
Bones that look like unto a Man's Hand;
when it is opened, and the Fingers are expan∣ded
or spread, between these Joynts there are
stiff Sinews, which flye up and rebound again
<PB REF="214"/>
<PB N="131" REF="214"/>
if you f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing them hard against the Ground, as
the Sinews of great Fish, as of a Sturgeon, or
of some four footed Beasts generally do. You
may cut pieces of these Sinews of the bigness
of your Head, they squeeze together when
thrown on the Ground, and so rebound very
high, and as swift as an Arrow from the String
of a long Bow. The Whale hath no other
Finns but these two wherewith he steers him∣self,
as a Boat is rowed with two Oars.</P>
<P>Their Tail doth not stand up as the Tails of
almost any other Fish, but it doth lye horizon∣tal,
as that of the <HI>Finn-fish, Butskopf, Dolphin,</HI>
and the like, and it is three, three and an half,
and four fathoms broad. The Head is the
third part of the Fish, and some have bigger
Heads; on the upper and under Lip are short
Hairs before. Their Lips are quite plain,
somewhat bended like an S, and they end un∣derneath
the Eyes before the two Finns:
Above the uppermost bended Lip he hath
black Streaks, some are darkish brown, and they
are crooked as the Lips are. Their Lips are
smooth, and quite black, round like the quarter
of a Circle; when they draw them together they
lock into one another: Within, on the upper∣most
Lip is the Whale-bone, of a brown, black,
and yellow colour, with streaks of several co∣lours,
as the Bones of a <HI>Finn-fish.</HI> The Whale∣bones
of some Whales are blew, and light blew,
which two are reckoned to come from young
Whales. In one of my Cutts here you may see
the Whale-bone in the Tab. <HI>Q</HI> marked with <HI>a.</HI>
In the other Cutt, where his Mouth is shut up,
you do not see the Whale bone. Just before,
on the under Lip, is a cavity or hole which the
upper Lip fits exactly into, as a Knife into a
<PB N="132" REF="215"/>
Sheath. I do really believe, that he draws the
Water that he bloweth out through this hole,
and so I have been informed also by Sea∣men.</P>
<P>Within his Mouth is the Whale-bone, all
hairy as a Horse's Hair, as it is also in the <HI>Finn-fish,</HI>
and it hangs down from both sides all about
his Tongue. The Whale-bone of some Whales
is somewhat bended like unto a Cimeter, and
others like unto a half-Moon.</P>
<P>The smallest Whale-bone is before, in his
Mouth, and behind towards his Throat; and
the middlemost is the greatest and longest, it
is sometimes about two or three Men's length,
from whence you may easily conjecture how
large this Fish must be. On one side, all in a
row, there is two hundred and fifty pieces of
Whale bone, and as many also on the other
side, which maketh five hundred in all, and
there is more over and above this number, for
they let the least Whale-bone of all remain, be∣cause
they cannot well come at it to cut it out,
because it is very narrow where the two Lips
meet together. The Whale-bone is in a flat
row one piece by the other, somewhat bended
within, and towards the Lips every where like
a half-Moon.</P>
<P>The Whale-bone is broad at the top, where
it sticketh fast to the upper Lip, every where
overgrown with hard and white Sinews towards
the Root, so that between two pieces of Whale-bone
you may put in your hand. These white
Sinews look like boiled <HI>Sea-catts</HI> or <HI>Black-fish</HI> (in
Spanish called <HI>Cattula la Mar</HI>) they are of a
pleasant Smell, so that we might eat of them;
they are not tough at all, but break as easily as
Cheese, but they did not taste so well; when
<PB N="133" REF="215"/>
they putrifie or rot they smell horribly, just like
unto a foul or rotten Tooth. Where the
Whale-bone is broadest, as underneath by the
Root, there groweth small Whale-bone, the
other greater, as you see small and large Trees
one amongst the other in a Wood. I believe
the small Whale-bone doth not grow bigger,
as one might think that some of the great pie∣ces
thereof might come out, and that so this
small Whale-bone might grow up again in the
room thereof, or as in Children the Hair grows
again when cut off; but it is not so, for this
Whale-bone is quite another sort, for it is from
one end to t'other of an equal thickness and full
of long Jacks like Horses Hair. The Whale-bone
is underneath narrow and pointed, and all
overgrown with Hair, that it may not hurt
that that is young: But without the Whale∣bone
hath a Cavity, for it is turned just like
unto a Gutter wherein the Water runs, where
it lyeth one over the other, as the Shields or
Plaits of <HI>Craw-fish,</HI> or the Pan-tiles of an House,
that lye one over the other, for else it might
easily wound or hurt the under Lips. I am of
opinion that one might use Whale-bone in any
thing that we use Boards for, for they make of
Whale-bone, Boxes, Knife-hafts, Walking-sticks,
and the like. I should think that out of the
Hair of the Fish might be made something, as
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do out of the wild <HI>Sempervive
Aloes,</HI> (by them called <HI>Savila</HI>) they prepare it
like Flax or Hemp, and so make Packthreads
Clothes and the like Manufactures of it.</P>
<P>To cut the Whale-bones out is also a peculiar
Trade, and abundance of Iron Tools belong
thereunto. The lower part of the Whale's
Mouth is commonly white. The Tongue ly∣eth
<PB N="134" REF="216"/>
amongst the Whale-bones; it is very close
tyed to the undermost Chap or Lip; it is very
large and white, with black spots at the edges:
It is a soft spongy Fat, which cannot easily be
cut; it makes a great deal of work to the Cutter
(for so they call the Man that doth cut the Fat
into small pieces with a large Knife, which
cannot well be done with other Knifes, be∣cause
it is tough and soft) wherefore they fling
the Tongue away, else they might get five, six
or seven Barrels of Train-oyl out of it; but, as
I said before, they fling it away, because of its
softness; and this is the most pleasing Food for
the <HI>Sword-fish.</HI> Upon his Head is the Hovel or
Bump before the Eyes and Finns: At the top
of this Bump, on each side, is a Spout-hole,
two over-against one another, which are ben∣ded
on each side like an S, or as the hole that
is cut on a Violin, whereout he doth blow the
Water very fiercely, that it roars like a hollow
Wind which we hear when the Wind blow∣eth
into a Cave, or against the corner of a
Board, or like an Organ-pipe. This may be
heard at a leagues distance, although you do
not see him by reason of the thick and foggy
Air. The <HI>Whale</HI> bloweth or spouts the Water
fiercest of all when he is wounded, then it
sounds as the roaring of the Sea in a great
Storm, and as we hear the Wind in a very hard
Storm. Behind this Bump the <HI>Whale</HI> is some∣what
more bended in than the <HI>Finn-fish,</HI> yet
when they swim you cannot well discern one
from the other, except you observe it very
exactly, for it is only the Finn on the <HI>Finn-fish</HI>'s
Back that distinguishes him from the <HI>Whale.</HI>
The Head of the <HI>Whale</HI> is not round at the top,
but somewhat flat, and goeth down sloaping,
<PB N="135" REF="216"/>
like unto the tyling of an House, to the under
Lip. The under Lip is broader than the <HI>Whale</HI>
is in any part of the Body, and broadest in the
middle; before and behind it is something
narrower, according to the shape of the Head.
In one word, all the whole Fish is shaped like un∣to
a Shoomaker's Last, if you look upon it from
beneath. Behind the Knob or Bump where
the Finns are, between that and the Finns, are
his Eyes, which are not much bigger than those
of a Bullock, with Eye-lids and Hair, like
Mens Eyes. The Crystal of the Eye is not
much bigger than a Pea, clear, white, and tran∣sparent
as Crystal; the colour of some is yel∣lowish,
of others quite white: The <HI>Seale</HI>'s are
three times as big as those of the <HI>Whale.</HI> The
Eyes of the <HI>Whale</HI> are placed very low, almost
at the end of the upper Lip. Some bring along
with them from <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> some Bones, which
they pretend to be the Ears of the <HI>Whale;</HI> but I
can say nothing to this, because I never saw
any; but thus much I do remember, that I
have heard them say that they lye very deep.</P>
<P>The <HI>Whale</HI> doth not hear when he spouts the
Water, wherefore he is easiest to be struck at
that time. His Belly and Back are quite red,
and underneath the Belly they are commonly
white, yet some of them are Coal black; most
of them that I saw were white. They look
very beautiful when the Sun shines upon them,
the small clear Waves of the Sea that are over
him glisten like Silver. Some of them are
marbled on their Back and Tail. Where he
hath been wounded there remaineth always a
white Scar. I understood of one of our Har∣pooniers
that he once caught a <HI>Whale</HI> at <HI>Spitz∣bergen</HI>
that was white all over. Half white I
<PB N="136" REF="217"/>
have seen some, but one above the rest, which
was a Female, was a beautiful one; she was all
over marbled black and yellow: Those that are
black are not all of the same colour, for some
of them are as black as Velvet, others of a Coal
black, others of the colour of a <HI>Tench.</HI> When
they are well they are as slippery as an Eel,
but one may stand upon them, because they are
so soft, that the Flesh thereof giveth way to our
weight: And the outward Skin is thin, like
Parchment, and is easily pulled off with ones
Hands when the Fish grows hot. I know not
whether the Skin is thus burnt by the inward
heat of the Fish when he lies dry a floating
upon the Water. The Sun beams seem not to
have so great power as to dry the Skin so.
We found our first <HI>Whale</HI> was so much heated
by his hard swimming that he stunk alive; we
could pull off great pieces of the Skin, of the
length of a Man, which we could not do to
other Fishes that were not so much heated:
But from <HI>Whales</HI> that have been dead some
days, and are dry, where also the Sun shines
upon them, or when it doth not rain, one may
pull off a great deal of the Skin, but it stinks
basely of Train-oyl, or Fat, that ferments thro'
the Pores of the Skin. I know not what use to
make of this Skin, but I have seen Women tye
their Flax with it about the Distaff.</P>
<P>The <HI>Whale</HI> loseth this beautiful white colour
when it groweth dry, for before there is more
black amongst it, which maketh the white shew
the better, neither doth the black look so well
after it is dry, for it groweth then brownish.
When you hold the Skin against the light, you
see many small Pores in it, where the Sweat co∣meth
through.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="217"/>
The Yard of the <HI>Whale</HI> is a strong Sinew,
and according as they are in bigness, six, seven
or eight foot long, as I have seen my self.
Where this Yard is fixed the Skin is doubled,
so that it lies just like a Knife in a Sheath,
where you can see nothing of the Knife but
only a little of the Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. The part of Genera∣tion
in the Female is just shaped like as that of
four-legged Beasts. At the sides of <HI>Pudendum</HI>
stand out the two Breasts, with Nipples on
them, like unto those of Cows: Some of these
Breasts are quite white, some are speckled with
black and blew spots, like a <HI>Lapwing</HI>'s Egg.
When they have no young ones they have but
small Breasts. I am informed, that when they
couple together they stand upright, close to one
another, with their Heads out of the Water;
which seemeth very probable, because they
cannot keep long under Water, and chefily in
such a heat. They say that they have but two
young ones at a time, for they have never
found more than two young ones within them.
How long they carry their young is not easily
determined; some say they go as long as a Cow,
but it is very uncertain, he that will believe it
may. The Sperm of a <HI>Whale,</HI> when it is fresh,
smells like Wheaten-flower that is boiled in
Water, when it is still hot it is very white;
one may draw it out in Threads like hot Seal∣ing-wax,
Glew, or the like; when it groweth
cold it turns to a Musk-colour, and smells strong,
and little red Worms grow in it, like unto the
grey ones, that you may see in the Tab. <HI>P.</HI> mar∣ked
with <HI>C.</HI> I have tryed several ways to keep
this Sperm sweet and fresh, but I could never
make it like unto that <HI>Sperma-caeti</HI> which the
<HI>Apothecaries</HI> sell in their Shops. One may dip
<PB N="138" REF="218"/>
of this Sperm whole Pails-full out of the Water,
for as well this as that of the <HI>Sea-horses</HI> and <HI>Seals</HI>
swims upon the Sea like Fat, and we see abun∣dance
of it in calm weather, so that it doth
make the Sea all foul and slimy. I tryed to
dry this Sperm of a <HI>Whale</HI> in the Sun, and it
lookt like Snot, and when the thin Slime was dry∣ed
away from it, looked like unto <HI>Fila meteorica,</HI>
save only that they are thicker and more heavy.
Another parcel I boiled in Sea-water, just as I
took it out of the Water, until the Water was
evaporated from it, then I had some Sea-salt,
and a nasty brown Slime. The third parcel I
boiled in fresh Water, and afterwards again in
Sea-water, and the longer I kept it afterwards
the more it stunk, and the harder it grew. The
fourth parcel I intended to keep in the Salt
Water, with an intention to carry it along with
me to <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> but it dissolved in the Water,
like Glew, and the Water became foul and
stinking, so that I could no ways make it like
the <HI>Sperma-ceti</HI> of the <HI>Apothecaries.</HI> Where the
Yard doth begin it is four-square, consisting of
many strong Sinews; if you dry them they are
as transparent as Fish-glew; out of these Sinews
the Seamen make twisted Whips. Their Bones
are hard, like unto them of great four-footed
Beasts, but porous, like unto a Spunge, and fil∣led
with Marrow, when that is consumed out
they will hold a great deal of Water, for the
holes are big, like unto the Wax of a Honey∣comb.
Two great and strong Bones hold up
the under Lip, they lye one against the other,
and both of them make a Figure like unto an
Half-moon, but one alone by itself makes a Fi∣gure
like to a quarter of the Moon. Some of
these Bones I saw at <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> lying on the
<PB N="139" REF="218"/>
<HI>Strand,</HI> about 20 foot long, of a very white
colour, as if they had been calcined. Our Sea∣men
bring some of these along with them home,
to shew us how big some <HI>Whales</HI> are, which are
already whitened to their Hands, for those that
come fresh from a Whale stink abominably, be∣cause
of the Marrow that is in them. Their
Flesh is course and hard, m and it doth look like
unto that of a Bull; it is intermixd with many
Sinews; it is very dry and lean when it is boi∣led,
because their Fat is only between their Flesh
and Skin: Some looks green and blew as our
Pouder'd Beef, chiefly where the Muscles meet
together; if one lets it lye a little, it grows
black and stinking. The Flesh of the Tail
boils tenderest, and is not quite so dry as that
of the Body. When we have a mind to eat of a
<HI>Whale,</HI> we cut great pieces off before the Tail,
where it is four-square, and boil it like other
Meat; good Beef I prefer far before it, yet
rather than be starved, I advise to eat <HI>Whale's
Flesh,</HI> for none of our Men dyed of it, and the
French-men did eat almost daily of it, they
fling it sometimes on the tops of their Tubs,
and let it lye until it is black, and yet they eat
it for all that. The Flesh of a <HI>Whale,</HI> as well as
that of the <HI>Seales,</HI> is alone by itself, and the Fat
at the top thereof, between the Flesh and Skin.
It is about six inches thick on the Back and Bel∣ly,
but I have also seen it a foot thick, upon a
Finn, according as they are great or little
Fish. The Fat of their under Lip is thicker
than two foot, and is the thickest of all the
<HI>Whale.</HI> The Tongue, as I have said before, is
fasten'd to it, but very soft, but it costs too much
labour to cut it. The Fat of some Whales is
much thicker than than that of others, as it is
<PB N="140" REF="219"/>
with other Animals or Men, where one is much
leaner that another. In the Fat are little Si∣news,
interspersed which hold the Oyl, as a
Sponge does Water, which one may squeeze
out. The other strong Sinews are chiefly about
the Tail, where it is thinnest, for with it he
turns and winds himself, as a Ship is turned by
the Rudder, but his Finns are his Oars, and ac∣cording
to his bigness he rows himself along
with them as swiftly as a Bird flies, and doth
make a long track in the Sea, as a great Ship
doth when under Sail, so that it remains divi∣did
for a while.</P>
<P>The <HI>Whales of the North Cape</HI> (they are so cal∣led,
because they are caught between <HI>Spitzber∣gen</HI>
and <HI>Norway</HI>) being not so big, therefore do
not yield so much Fat as those of <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI>
for of those of the <HI>North Cape</HI> you shall not fill
above ten, twenty, or thirty Cardels of Fat;
the middling sort of those of <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> yield
commonly seventy, eighty, or ninety, and they
are about fifty or sixty foot long. Our biggest
<HI>Whale</HI> was fifty three foot long, and we cut off
him as much Fat as filled seventy Cardels; his
Tail was about three fathom and an half broad.
The Skipper <HI>Peter Peterson</HI> of <HI>Friesland</HI> informed
me, that they found a dead Whale, whereof
they did cut as much fat as filled One hundred
and thirty Cardels, his Tail was three fathom
and an half broad, but he was not much longer
than our biggest, as one may guess by the Tail
also, yet much thicker and fatter; from whence
one may in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, that they do not grow much
longer, but only in thickness or fatness, as we
daily see: Nor did I ever hear that a bigger or
fatter <HI>Whale</HI> was ever caught, and even those
but seldom, for if there were many such, our
<PB N="141" REF="219"/>
Ships could not hold so much Fat as is cut from
ten, fifteen, or twenty <HI>Whales,</HI> as some of them
have sometimes taken in.</P>
<P>Over the Fat is, besides the uppermost thin
Skin already described, another Skin of about
an inch thick, proportionable to the bigness
of the <HI>Whale;</HI> it is coloured according to the
colour of the Fish; if the Fish be black, this
undermost thick Skin is so; if the outmost Skin
that is like Parchment is white or yellow, the
thick one underneath it is of the same colour.
This thick Skin is not stiff nor tough at all, so
that one might dress it like Leather, but it
dries just like unto the Fungus that grows on
Elder, which we call <HI>Jews-ears,</HI> which are
thick and turgid when they are green and
fresh, but brittle when they are dried; where∣fore
this Skin is not esteemed at all. This and
the uppermost thin Skin that covers this, are
the occasion that the <HI>Whale,</HI> which I take to
be the strongest and biggest of all Creatures in
the Water, cannot make use of his Strength,
because they are too soft to do much.</P>
<P>I have nothing to relate of the inward parts
of the <HI>Whale,</HI> but only that his Guts seem to
be of a Flesh colour; they were full of Wind,
and the Dung that was within them was yel∣low.</P>
<P>The Food of the <HI>Whale,</HI> as it is believed, are
the small Sea-Snails, the Draught whereof you
may see at <HI>c,</HI> in the Tab. <HI>Q,</HI> whereof I have
made mention in another place, which some
take for Spiders; whether these afford such
great nourishment, I cannot exactly tell. Some
say, that they live only by the Wind, but then
methinks they must have nothing in them but
Wind, which I found otherwise. I was infor∣med
<PB N="142" REF="220"/>
by others, that about <HI>Hitland</HI> a small <HI>Whale</HI>
was caught, had about a Barrel of <HI>Herrings</HI> in
his Belly. They are smaller <HI>Whales</HI> than those
we catch at <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> but there is more dan∣ger
in catching of them, they being less and
nimbler than the great ones, to whom the
Water doth not so easily give way as to these,
for they jump and play in the Water, and keep
their Tail commonly above Water, so that one
dare not come near to them to launce them.
Concerning the <HI>Whale</HI>'s Valour, we do find
that he is not very couragious, according to
his strength and bigness, for if he sees a Man
o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Long-boat, he goeth under Water, and
runs away. I did never see nor hear, that out
of his own Malice he endeavour'd to hurt any
Man, but when he is in danger; what then he
doth is of necessity, and then he doth not va∣lue
a man no more than a Sand, nor a Long∣boat,
for he doth beat them all into Splinters.
His Strength may be guess'd by the Fishermen
that catch with great Nets other Fishes, when
they are going to draw their Nets towards the
Land, what a great Strength they must use,
which is nothing at all to be compared to his
Strength. The <HI>Whale</HI> doth swim sometimes
away with some thousand fathoms of Rope-line,
swifter a great deal than a Ship can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail, or a
Bird can fly, so that it makes their Heads gid∣dy;
yet a great Ship is too many for him, for
although he should strike against it with his
Tail, yet it doth him more hurt than he does
the Ship.</P>
<P>The <HI>Whales</HI> keep, in the Spring, Westward
from <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> near old <HI>Greenland</HI> and the
Island of <HI>John Majen;</HI> then they run Eastwards
to <HI>Spitzbergen:</HI> After them come the <HI>Finn-fish,</HI>
<PB N="143" REF="220"/>
and then there is no more <HI>Whales</HI> seen. It is
probable they go after a tolerable cold place;
for after that, I have seen <HI>Finn-fish</HI> in the <HI>Spanish</HI>
Sea in the year 1671. in the Month of <HI>Decem∣ber,</HI>
and in the Year 1672. in <HI>January,</HI> and also
afterwards in the year 1673. in the <HI>Straights</HI> of
<HI>Gibralter</HI> in <HI>March,</HI> and also in the <HI>Mediterra∣nean.</HI></P>
<P>He swims against the Wind, as all other
<HI>Whales</HI> or great Fish do. The <HI>Sword-fish</HI> is his
mortal Enemy, he might rather be called <HI>Comb-fish,</HI>
because his long Tooth is on each side full
of Teeth or Prickles, most like a Comb. In
our Home-Voyage to <HI>Hamburg</HI> I saw an Exam∣ple
of this Enmity of a <HI>Northcaper-Whale</HI> and a
<HI>Sword-fish,</HI> near to <HI>Hitland,</HI> they fought and
struck at one another so vehemently, that the
Water flew about like Dust, sometimes one and
sometimes the other was uppermost; the wea∣ther
was a little stormy, or else we had stayed
to have seen the end of the Battel, so we were
forced to leave them.</P>
<P>The dead <HI>Whale</HI> killed by the <HI>Sword-fish</HI> stinks
at a great distance, but not presently, and those
that have been wounded some days before they
are caught smell the worst, and drive high
above the Sea-water, when others drive even
with the Water; and some sink.</P>
<P>The <HI>Whales</HI> have, as well as other Beasts,
their peculiar Distempers and Aliments, but
I can only write of what I know by Hear-say.
An ancient and experienc'd Harpoonier infor∣med
me, that he did once catch a <HI>Whale</HI> that
was very feeble, and that all his Skin, but
chiefly near unto the Tail and Finns, hung like
Films, as if they were old Rags dragg'd along
<PB N="144" REF="221"/>
behind him, and that he was quite fean, so
they made but very little Train oyl of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at,
for the fat was quite white, and light withal as
an empty Honey-comb. Before a Tempest
they beat the Water, that it doth fly about like
upon Dust, with their Tail; but they have
the greatest strength when they strike side∣wards
as if they did mow, so that one might
think that they were in a great agony, and
a dying. They are mightily tormented by the
Lice, whereof I have treated more at large
above: The Draught of this Louse you may
see at <HI>d,</HI> in the Tab. <HI>Q.</HI></P>
<P>The Wounds that are given unto the <HI>Whale</HI>
by the Harpoons, into the fat, heal up again
of their own accord, for the Salt-water cannot
stick on it. Many <HI>such Fishes</HI> are caught, that
have been struck by others with a Harpoon,
and are healed up again, and so have white
Scarrs.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">How they Catch the Whale.</HEAD>
<P>FIrst, it is to be observed, that when it is like
to be a good Year to catch <HI>Whales</HI> in, there
is many <HI>White-fish</HI> to be seen before: But where
we see many <HI>Seales,</HI> there we do not expect to
meet with many <HI>Whales;</HI> for they say, that
they eat up the Food of the <HI>Whale,</HI> wherefore
the <HI>Whales</HI> will not stay in such empty places,
but go to find out better, and so come to <HI>Spitz∣bergen,</HI>
for there, at the Shoar, we see great
plenty of the small Sea-snails, (you may see
them marked with <HI>e</HI> in the Tab. <HI>Q</HI>) and per∣haps
some other small Fish. They are caught
after the following manner: When they see
<HI>Whales,</HI> or when they hear them blow or spout,
they call in to the Ship, <HI>Fall, fall;</HI> then every
Body must be ready to get into the Long-boat
that he doth belong to, commonly six Men go
into every Long-boat, and sometimes seven,
according as the Long-boats are in bigness, they
all of them row until they come very near un∣to
the <HI>whale,</HI> then doth the Harpoonier arise,
who sits always before in the Boat, where the
Harpoon or the sharp Iron made like unto an
Arrow fixed to a Stick, doth also lye on the
foremost Board of the Long-boat, which the
Seamen call the <HI>Staffen,</HI> that is, the broad piece
of Wood that cometh up before the Boat from
<PB N="146" REF="222"/>
the bottom, and stands up higher than all the
rest. But when the <HI>Whale</HI> runs streight down
towards the bottom underneath the Wa∣ter,
then he doth draw the Rope very hard, so
that the upper part of the Long-boat is even
with the surface of the Water; nay, he would
certainly pull it down to the bottom, if they
should not give him Rope enough: This he
doth commonly where the Sea is deepest; and
this doth require an incredible force to draw so
many hundred fathoms of Rope under Water.
This giveth me occasion to remember, that
when we on the 27th of <HI>April,</HI> in the Year
1672. did fling out our Lead, near St. <HI>Kilda,</HI>
behind <HI>Scotland,</HI> into the Sea, where it was 120
fathom deep when the Weather was calm, and
when we would pull it up again, it was so heavy
that 20 Men had much to do to heave it.
The Harpoonier taketh his Harpoon, and holds
the Point or the Iron thereof, together with the
Fore-runner, towards his Left hand: this is a
Rope or Line of five or seven fathom long,
about an inch thick, and is laid up round like
a Ring, that it may not hinder the Harpoon
when it is flung, for as soon as he doth fling or
dart the Harpoon this Line follows, for it is
more plyable than the rest that are fastened to
it, wherewith they pursue the <HI>Whale.</HI> It is made
of the finest and softest Hemp, and not daubed
with Tarr, but it doth swell in the Water, and
so it grows hard. The Harpoonier darts his
Harpoon with the Right hand at the Fish; as
you may see by <HI>m</HI> in the Tab. <HI>A.</HI> When the
<HI>Whale</HI> is hit with the Harpoon, all the Men
that are in the Long-boat turn themselves about
and look before them, and they lay their Oars
nimbly upon the sides of the Long-boat. There
<PB N="147" REF="222"/>
is a Man in the Long-boat, whose business it is
to look after the Rope; as you may see at <HI>N,</HI>
in the Tab. <HI>A;</HI> for in each of these Long-boats
there is a whole heap of Lines, between the
two Seats or Benches; this Heap is divided in∣to
three, four, or five parts, and each of them
is of eighty, ninety, to one hundred fathoms
long. The first of them is tyed to the Fore∣runner,
or small Line; as the <HI>Whale</HI> runs under
the Water, they tye more and more Line to it,
and if in one Boat there should not be enough,
they make use of those that are in the other
Long boats. These Ropes or Lines are thicker
and stronger than the Fore-runner, and are
made of strong and tough Hemp, and Tarred
over. The Line-furnisher, or the man that
doth look after the Ropes, and also the other
Men that are in the Long-boat, must have great
care that the Ropes or Lines may not be en∣tangled
when they run out so swift, or that
they may not run towards the side of the Long-boat,
for then the Long-boat would be over∣set,
and many Men lose their Lives, if other
Long-boats were not near to their assistance.
The Line must run just before, in the middle
of the Long-boat, that is called the <HI>Stave</HI> by
the Seamen, and by reason of this strong and
violent motion the Wood and Rope, would be
set on fire. But to prevent this, the Harpoonier
hath a wet Rag tied to a Stick (like unto a
Mop) ready at hand, wherewith he wets the
Wood without ceasing. The other three Men
that are in the Long-boats take also care of the
Lines, as well when they are let out, as when
they are taken in again, and when they cannot
hold it with their Hands, they wind it about
the Staves of the Boat, and so they do stop it
<PB N="146" REF="223"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="147" REF="223"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="148" REF="224"/>
from going any further. Another that is cal∣led
the Steerman, stands behind in the Long∣boat,
as you may see by <HI>o</HI> in the Tab. <HI>A,</HI> and
steers the Boat with an Oar, and he takes great
care, and minds the Rope, to see which way
it runs out, for if it doth go towards either side,
and doth not run just before over the Stave, he
so guides the Boat, that it may run exactly out
before. The Whale runs away with the Long-boat
as swift as the Wind. If the Harpoonier
can, he doth dart the Harpoon just behind the
Spout-hole of the <HI>Whale</HI> or in the thick Fat of his
Back, where they also do launce him, for that
maketh him spout Blood sooner than if woun∣ded
in any other place, and dye sooner than if
you should launce them into their Belly, or
through the Guts. The first <HI>Whale,</HI> we caught
spouted Blood, in such a quantity, that the Sea
was tinged by it where-ever he swam, where∣unto
the <HI>Mallemucks</HI> flock'd in great numbers,
as I have mentioned before. They also launce
the <HI>Whales</HI> near their privy parts, if they can
come at it, for if they are run in there it doth
pain them very much; nay, even when they
are almost dead, if you run in your Launce
thereabout, it causes the whole Body to trem∣ble.
For the most part they do not much
mind where they launce or push them, for
there is no time to take great deliberation, but
they strike at him as well as they can. But
about the Head the Harpoon can do him no
hurt, because the Fat is but very <HI>thin</HI> there upon
the Bones, which the <HI>Whales</HI> know as well as we;
for when they find themselves in danger, so
that they cannot escape the Harpoon, they
rather leave their Head than their Back unde∣fended,
for there the Harpoon breaks out easier,
<PB N="149" REF="224"/>
and so the <HI>Whale</HI> gets away, like one that hath
no mind to fight any longer. The Use of the
Harpoon is, to tye, as it were, the <HI>Whales</HI> with
them, that they may not run away: It is sha∣ped
like an Arrow before, as you may see at <HI>f,</HI>
in the Tab. <HI>{que}</HI> it hath two sharp Beards, they
are sharp at the edge, and have a broad Back,
like unto a Hatchet that is sharp before and
blunt behind, or on the Back, so that it may
not cut with its Back, for else it would tear out
and all your Labour would be lost. The Iron
Handle is thicker behind than before, and it is
hollow, whereinto they put the Stick, as you
may see in the Tab. <HI>Q,</HI> marked with <HI>h.</HI> Be∣fore
this hollow part, the Fore-goer is fa∣sten'd
or tyed, that is to say the foremost Rope,
as you may see in the Tab. <HI>Q,</HI> marked with <HI>i.</HI>
Those are the best Harpoons that are made of
clean and fine Steel, and are not hardened too
much, so that you may bend it without snap∣ping,
for oftentimes Two hundred Pounds are
lost (for a midling <HI>Whale</HI> is esteem'd at so much)
in a minutes time for want of a good and well-temper'd
Harpoon. The Wooden Stick is fa∣stened
within the Iron Collet or Funnel of the
Harpoon, with Packthread wound all about
the Iron; somewhat higher up, about two spans
off, there is a hole made through the Stick, as
you may see marked with <HI>k,</HI> in the Tab. <HI>Q.</HI>
The Harpoon is light behind, and heavy to∣wards
the point, or before, like an Arrow, that
is made heavy before with Iron, and light be∣hind
with Feathers, so that fling it which way
you will, it doth fall always upon the point.
Through this hole cometh a piece of Pack-thread,
wherewith the end of the Fore-runner
is fastened to the Handle or Stick of the Har∣poon,
<PB N="150" REF="225"/>
but this is soon torn off, and it serveth
for nothing more after the Harpoon sticks in
the Body of the <HI>Whale;</HI> neither is the Wooden
Handle of any further use, and so it doth soon
come out from the Iron. When the <HI>Whale</HI> is
struck with the Harpoon, all the other Long-boats
row out before, and take notice which
way the Line doth stand, and sometimes they
pull at the Rope or Line (as you may see in
the Tab. <HI>A,</HI> marked with <HI>p.</HI>) If it is stiff and
heavy, the <HI>Whale</HI> doth draw it still with his
might; but if it doth hang loose, so that the
Long-boat is before and behind equally high
out of the Water, then the Men pull in the
Rope again, (as you may see in the Tab. <HI>A,</HI>
marked with <HI>q</HI>) and the Rope-giver layeth it
down in very good order (as you may see at
<HI>n,</HI> in the Tab. <HI>A</HI>) round, and one row above
the other, that if the <HI>Whale</HI> should draw on
again, he may have it ready to give him with∣out
being entangled. Here is also this to be
observed, that if the <HI>Whale</HI> runs upon the level
they must not give him too much Rope, for if
he should turn and wind himself much and of∣ten
about, he might easily wind the Rope about
a Rock or heavy Stone, and so fasten it to it,
and so the Harpoon would come out, and all
the Labour would be lost; which hath often
hapned, and we ourselves lost one that way.
The other Long-boats that are towed behind,
wherein the Men look all before them, and sit
still, and let the <HI>Whale</HI> draw them along: If
the <HI>Whale</HI> doth rowl upon the Ground, so that
the Long-boats or Sloops lye still, they draw
their Lines in again by degrees, and the Rope-master
doth lay them down again in their pro∣per
places, as they had been laid before. When
<PB N="151" REF="225"/>
they kill the <HI>Whale</HI> with Launces, they also pull
their Lines in again, until they come near to the
<HI>Whale,</HI> yet at some distance, that the others may
have room to launce: But they must have great
care, that all the Lines of every Sloop may not
be cut off together, because some <HI>Whales</HI> sink,
and others do swim even with the Water when
they are dead, which no body can tell before∣hand,
whether they will do one or the other.
The fat ones do not sink presently after they are
fresh killed, but the lean ones sink immediately
after they are dead, but after some few days
they come up again, and swim on the Water:
But it would be too long a while for a Man to
stay until he cometh up again, and the Sea is
never so quiet that one can stay long in the
same place, and where the Sea is quiet, and
without Waves, there the Stream doth carry
the Ships and the Ice along together, so that
we should be forced to leave the <HI>Whale</HI> unto
others, that would find him dead some days af∣ter.
'T'is true, this is the easiest way to catch
<HI>Whales,</HI> but it is very nasty and stinking work;
for long and white Maggots grow in their Flesh,
they are flat like unto Worms that breed in
Mens Bellies, and they smell worse than ever I
smelt any thing in my Life. The longer the
<HI>Whale</HI> lies dead in the Water, the higher he doth
swim above it; some swim a foot high above
the Water, others to their middle, and then
they do burst easily, and give a very great re∣port.
They begin immediately to stink, and
this encreases hourly, and their Flesh boils and
ferments like unto Beer or Ale, and holes break
in their Bellies, that their Guts come out. If
any Man is enclined to sore Eyes, this Vapour
enflames them immediately, as if Quicklime
<PB N="152" REF="226"/>
was flung into them. But when the live <HI>Whales</HI>
rise and swim again, some of them are astonish'd,
others wild or stark mad: To those that are
wild we come softly or gently from behind,
as we do when we are going to trapan them;
for when the Wind is down, the Weather
calm, and A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> serene, so that the Sea doth
not foam or roar, the <HI>Whales</HI> hear immediate∣ly
the striking of the Oars.</P>
<P>If many small Ice-sheets lye near to one
another, so that we cannot follow the <HI>Whale</HI>
with our Sloops or Long-boats, we fetch in
our Line with all might and strength, and if
with one or more pulls we can fetch out the
Harpoon it is well, if not, we chop off the
Rope or Line. The <HI>Whale</HI> is best and surest
struck with a Harpoon when he spouts Wa∣ter,
as is already said above, for we do ob∣serve,
that when they lye still and very quiet,
that they then listen, and are sometimes un∣der,
and sometimes above Water, so that their
Back doth not quite dry, and before we are
aware of it he flings up his Tail behind out of
the Sea, and so bids us good-b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wy; as you may
see at <HI>s,</HI> in the Tab. <HI>A.</HI> The <HI>Whales,</HI> may easily
be caught when the Air is very serene and
clear, and the Sea quiet, and where there float
neither great nor small Ice-sheets, so that we
may go in between them with our Boats or
Sloops, to follow them; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or at the Ice-fields
the <HI>Whales</HI> do commonly lye and rub them∣selves
at them, perhaps by reason of the Lice
that bite them. Besides, against the Ice-sheets
the Sea beats, dashes, and foams, with small
curling Waves, so that the <HI>Whales</HI> do not ob∣serve
nor mind the striking of the Oars, and so
they are easily struck with the Harpoon. It is
<PB N="153" REF="226"/>
very dangerous to kill a Female, chiefly when
she is big with young, for they defend them∣selves
very long, and are harder to be killed
than a Male one. Oftentimes the Long-boats
wait six or seven hours, nay, a whole day, for
a <HI>Whale;</HI> before they see one.</P>
<P>Where great quantity of small Ice is crowded
together, there it is also very dangerous, and
hard to come to the <HI>Whale,</HI> for he is so cun∣ning,
that when he perceives where the Ice is
he retires thither immediately. The Harpoo∣nier
stands at the Head of the Long-boat, and
doth draw on the Rope, as you may see at <HI>p,</HI>
in the Tab. <HI>A,</HI> to try whether it is heavy or
light; if it feels heavy, so that we are afraid
that it will pull the Boat under Water, then
we give him more Rope, if he runs streight
out before, he draweth the Sloops after him.
If he doth run underneath a great Ice-field,
the Harpoonier taketh a Knife into his Hand,
as you may see at <HI>R,</HI> in the Tab <HI>A,</HI> which
they call the Chopping-Knife, and if the Ice-field
be hollow, or spungy, or full of holes in
the middle, so that the <HI>Whale</HI> can fetch breath
underneath it, and the Rope is not long enough
to follow him, and if the Ice be several miles
long, they draw the Rope in as much as
possibly they can, until it be streight, and
then he chops it off, loosing the piece of the
Rope whereon the Harpoon is fastened, that
sticketh in the Body of the <HI>Whale,</HI> yet not with∣out
great loss, for oftentimes they run away
with the Lines that belong to five and more
Sloops. It happens very often, that they run
to the Ice with the Long-boats, so that they
dash against it, as if they would break it into
pieces, which also very often happens. But
<PB N="154" REF="227"/>
when the <HI>Whale</HI> rises again, they oftentimes
fling one or two more Harpoons into him,
according as they find he is tired more or less,
then he dives under Water again. Some swim
or run even all along on the Water, and they
play with their Tail and Finns, so that we
must have great care that we may not come
too near them. When the <HI>Whales</HI> fling their
Tails about after this manner, they wind the
Line about their Tail, so that we need not to
fear the Harpoon tearing out, for then they
are ty'd strong and firm enough with the Rope.
After they are wounded, they spout with all
their might and main, so that you may hear
them as far off as you may a Cannon;
but when they are quite tired, it cometh out
only by drops, for he hath not strength enough
to force the Water up, and therefore it sounds
as if you held an empty Mug or Bottle under
Water, and the Water runs into it. And this
sound is a certain sign of his feebleness, and
that he is going to expire. Some <HI>Whales</HI> blow
Blood to the very last, after they have been
wounded, and these dash the Men in the Long-boats
most filthily, and dye the Sloops as red
as if they were painted with a red colour;
nay, the very Sea is tinged red all along where
they swim. Those <HI>Whales</HI> that are mortally
wounded heat themselves, that they reek while
they are alive, and the Birds sit on them, and
eat on them while they are still alive. When
the <HI>Whales</HI> blow up the Water, they fling out
with it some fattish substance that floats upon
the Sea, like Sperm, and this Fat the <HI>Mallemucks</HI>
devour greedily, of which several thousands at∣tend
him, so that a <HI>Whale</HI> often hath more At∣tendants
than a King hath Servants; as you
<PB N="155" REF="227"/>
may see by <HI>T,</HI> in the Tab. <HI>A.</HI> Sometimes also
the Harpoons break out; then often Long-boats
of other Ships attend, and as soon as they
see that the Harpoon is come out, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing
their own into him, and the <HI>Whale</HI> is theirs, al∣though
the first Harpoon hath almost killed the
<HI>whale,</HI> yet if he doth get loose, the second Par∣ty
claims him, and the first must look for ano∣ther.
Sometimes at the same time two Har∣poons,
belonging to two several Ships are struck
into the <HI>Whale,</HI> such ones are divided equally,
and each one hath half; as you may see at
<HI>MM,</HI> in the Tab. <HI>A;</HI> the other two, or three,
or more Sloops, as many as there is of them,
wait for the <HI>Whale</HI>'s coming up again, and when
they see that he is tired, they kill him outright
with Launces. In doing this is the greatest
danger, for the first that do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing the Harpoon
into him are drawn along by the <HI>Whale,</HI> and
are at a good distance from him, but those that
kill him with Launces are as well upon his Body
as at his Sides, according as the <HI>Whale</HI> turns
and winds himself, and they receive many se∣vere
Blows. Here the Steersman must take
care to observe how the <HI>Whale</HI> runs and turns
himself about, that the Harpoonier may reach
him with his Launces; all the other Men in the
Sloops row diligently, sometimes forwards, and
sometimes backwards, which they call <HI>rowing
on</HI> and <HI>striking,</HI> and when the <HI>Whale</HI> lifts up
himself out of the Water, he commonly doth
strike about with his Tail and Finns, that the
Water dasheth up like Dust. A Long-boat he
values no more than Dust, for he can beat it
all into shatters at a blow: but a great Ship is
too hard for him, and if he strikes against it
with his Tail, he feels it more that the Ship,
<PB N="156" REF="228"/>
for he doth so paint the Ship with his own
Blood, that it maketh him very feeble. A
good Steerman is next unto the Harpoonier
most useful in the Sloop; he steers with one
Oar, and doth look out before: the other four
Men turn their Back to the Head, and look to∣wards
the Stern, therefore doth the Steerman
and Harpoonier always cry, <HI>Row on,</HI> or <HI>strike,</HI>
that is to say, row near to the <HI>Whale,</HI> or else
keep farther off. The Launces have a Wooden
Stick or Handle above two fathoms long, or
somewhat shorter than a Pikestaff; as in the
Tab. <HI>Q.</HI> you may see at <HI>g;</HI> the Iron thereof is
commonly a fathom long, and pointed before
like unto a Pike; it is made of Steel or tough
Iron, that it may bend without breaking: for
after you have made a deep hole in his Body
with your Launces, you poke into it with them
one way and the other way, as they do when
they poke for Eels, as you may see at <HI>Z,</HI> in
the Tab. <HI>A;</HI> but if he doth get one or more
out of your Hands, you take another, for every
Sloop hath at least five, six, or seven, and yet
sometimes he has them all out of three, four, or
more Boats sticking in his Body.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">What they do with the dead Whale.</HEAD>
<P>AFter the <HI>Whale</HI> is killed they cut off his
Tail; some keep the Tail and Finns, and
hang them up at the outside of their Ship, for
that defends them from the Ice when it pres∣seth
upon the Ship: The Tail hinders the Boat
in its course, because it doth lye cross, and that
is the reason why they cut it off. Before the
Tail they fasten to a piece of a Rope, and at the
other end at the Stern of the last Sloop, as you
may see in the Tab. <HI>A,</HI> marked with <HI>W.</HI> There
is in all four or five Sloops fastened to one ano∣ther
behind, and so they row one behind the
other to the great Ship. When they have
brought the <HI>Whale</HI> to the Ship, they tye it with
Ropes fast to the Ship; that part where the
Tail is cut off they fasten the fore-part of
the Ship, and the Head towards the Stern,
about the middle, near the great Shrowds of
the Mainmast on the Larboard of the Ship; it
is seldom that a <HI>Whale</HI> doth reach farther than
from the Poop to the middle of the Ship, ex∣cept
the Vessels are very small; as you may
see at <HI>X,</HI> in the Tab. <HI>A.</HI></P>
<P>By the Larboard is to be understood that side
of the Ship that is at your Right Hand as you
go from before towards the Stern; but that side
of the Ship that is on your Right Hand as you
<PB N="158" REF="229"/>
go from the Stern towards the Fore-part is cal∣led
Star-board, because you go from the Steer
forward.</P>
<P>Whoever of the Ships Crew sees a dead
<HI>Whale,</HI> cries out <HI>Fish mine,</HI> and therefore the
Merchants must pay him a Ducat, for his Care
and Vigilance. Many of them climb often
up into the Mast in hopes to have a Ducat,
but in vain.</P>
<P>When the dead <HI>Whale</HI> is thus fastened to the
Ship, two Sloops hold on the other side of the
Fish or Whale, and in each of them doth stand
a Man or Boy, that has a long Hook in his
Hands, wherewith he doth hold the Boat to
the Ship, and the Harpoonier stands before in
the Sloop, or upon the Whale, with a Leathern
Suit on, and sometimes they have boots on.
Underneath the Hook are some sharp Nails
fixed, that they may be able to stand firm, for
the Whale is very slippery, so that one may ea∣sily
fall, as upon slippery Ice. These two Men
that cut the Fat off have their peculiar Wages
for it, <HI>viz.</HI> about four or five Rix Dollars.
First, they cut a large piece from behind the
Head, by the Eyes, which they call the <HI>Ken∣ter
piece,</HI> that is as much as to say the Wnding-piece;
for, as they cut all the other Fat all in
rows, from the Whale towards the end, so they
cut this great <HI>Kenter-piece</HI> larger and wider than
all the rest. This piece, when it is cut round
about from the Whale, reaches from the
Water to the Cradle, (that is the round Circle
that goeth round about the middle of the Mast,
and is made in the shape of a Basket) from
whence you may guess at the bigness of a
Whale. A strong and thick Rope is fixed to
this <HI>Kenter-piece,</HI> and the other end is fixed un∣derneath
<PB N="159" REF="229"/>
the Cradle, whereby the Whale is as
it was born up out of the Water, that they may
come at it, and by reason of the great weight
of the Whale, the Ship leans towards that side.
One may judge how tough the Fat is, for in
this piece an hole is made, through which the
Rope is fastened, yet not deep into the Fat,
wherewith they turn the Fish at pleasure; as
you may see at <HI>K,</HI> in the Tab. <HI>A.</HI> Then, as is
before said, they cut another piece down hard
by this, that is also halled up to the Ship; as
you may see at <HI>L,</HI> in the Tab. <HI>A;</HI> and then in
the Ship they cut it into less pieces about a
foot square. These two Men have in their
Hands, as well as those that stand on the Whale,
long Knives, wherewith they cut these square
pieces. These Knives are, with their Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts,
about the length of a Man; and the more the
Fat of the Whale is loosened, just as the Hide
is flea'd from an Ox, the higher must they pull
up the Fat with their Pulleys, that they may
cut it the easier. And when they have drawn
up this Fat, the Men take it in to them into
the Ship, and loosen the Rope that is was faste∣ned
unto. The Rope is fastened with a Ring,
whereinto they put a great Iron Hook, which
is fastened to a strong Tackle, and also some∣times,
before in the Ship, are fixed two other
Tackle, wherewith all the Fat is drawn up into
the Ship. In the Ship stand two Men, with
Hooks as long as a Man, wherewith they hold
the great piece of Fat, which the two Men cut
into square pieces with their long Knives. By
them stands another, that hath a short Hook
with a Ring in his Hands, which he thrusts in∣to
the pieces of Fat that are cut square, and
puts it upon the Bench or Dressing-board, where
<PB N="160" REF="230"/>
it is cut by others into less pieces. The two
first Men with their long Knives, that cut the
large pieces of Fat, stand near the Larboard of
the Ship, at that side where the Whale is fixed,
and the other Men that afterwards cut it into
less pieces, stand on the other side called Star-board,
as you may see at <HI>I,</HI> in the Tab. <HI>A.</HI>
when it is a good time to catch Whales, and
they will not lose it, they tow sometimes se∣veral
Fish behind their Ship, and catch more;
and they cut only the great pieces of Fat of
them, and fling them underneath into the Ship-But
when they have no more Vessels to put
their Fat into, they sail into an Harbour; or if
it be calm weather, and not windy, they stay
in the Sea, and fasten themselves to a sheet of
Ice, and so they drive along with the Stream.
The other Men cut the Fat into small pieces,
on a Table; on the further side of the Table is
a Nail fastened, whereunto they fasten a Hook,
which they put into the Fat, that it may lye
steddy when they cut it into small pieces, the
Fat is tough to cut, wherefore it must lye firm.
That side whereon the Skin is they lay under∣most,
and so cut the Fat from it by pieces. The
Knives wherewith they cut the Fat into small
pieces are less than the other, about three foot
long with their Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts. They all cut from them
that they may not be bedaubed with the Fat,
which might occasion a shrinking up and lame∣ness
of the Sinews of their Hands and Arms.
One of them cuts the soft and tough Fat into
small pieces with a long Knife; this Man they
call the <HI>Chopper,</HI> and he is mightily daubed,
wherefore he doth hang about him all sorts of
Rags and Clouts he can get. The Fat of some
Whales is white, of others yellow, and of some
<PB N="161" REF="230"/>
red. The white Fat is full of small Sinews,
and it does not yield so much Oyl as the yellow.
The yellow Fat that looks like Butter is the
best. The red and watery Fat cometh from
dead <HI>Whales,</HI> for in the place where the Fat
runs out the Blood settles in its room, and yields
the worst and least Oyl. Before the Table is a
Gutter made of two Boards nailed together,
whereinto the small or minced Fat is flung;
by it stands a Boy that shuffles the Fat by de∣grees
into a Bag that is fixed to the end of the
Gutter, and is like unto a Pudding-bag, so long
that it reaches down into the Ship; out of this
Bag the Fat runs down into a Tub or Wooden
Funnel, which they put upon empty Vessels
or Cardels, as they call them, and the Men that
are below in the Ship fill them with it, and so
it is kept until they try it up into Train-oyl.
When the Fat is cut off from one side of the
<HI>Whale,</HI> before they turn him, they cut out the
Whale-bone in one entire piece, and this is so
heavy, that all the Ship's Crew hath enough to
do to pull it up. They make use, for that pur∣pose,
of a peculiar sort of Hooks, two whereof
they fix on the sides, and one on the middle of
it, very well provided with strong Tackle, as
you may see in the Tab. <HI>R,</HI> and afterwards
they cut out the Whale-bone of the other side
of the Fish, and draw it up also with Pulleys
into the Ship, where it is cut into such pieces
as they bring it hither in. The Whale-bone
doth only belong to the owners of the Ship,
and the others that run their hazard, whether
they catch few or many <HI>Whales.</HI> The rest,
which take their Pay by the Month, receive
their Money when they come home, whether
they have caught many or none, and the Loss
<PB N="162" REF="231"/>
or Gain falls upon the Merchants. The Hooks
that they crane up the Whale-bone withal are
made on purpose for it, like a Beam of a pair of
Scales; on each end are two sharp points,
which they knock in between the Whale-bone;
in the middle of the Beam is fastened a long
Handle with a Ring, whereon the Ropes are
fastened; on this Handle there are fixed two
other crooked Hooks like Birds Claws; in the
Ring where the Ropes are fastened is another
crooked Hook, at the top fastened by a Ring,
such a one as we make use of here when we
wind any thing up by a Crane; but in the mid∣dle
between these two Hooks is fastened ano∣ther
Rope, which keeps the lowermost Hook
steddy; the two hindmost points are knocked
into the Whale-bone behind, and the two fore∣most
short ones before, which hold the Whale-bone
fast between them when it is wound or
pulled up.</P>
<P>The dead <HI>Whales,</HI> when the Fat is cut off of
them, they let float, and are the Food of the
Birds of Prey, when they are hungry, but
but they had rather have dead <HI>Whales</HI> that have
still their Fat left on them. The white Bear
is generally not far off, whether there be any
Fat left on them or no, and look like Dogs that
only feed upon Carrion, and at that time their
white Furr is turned into a yellow colour, and
at the same time they shed their Hair, and
their Skins are worth very little. Where a dead
<HI>Whale</HI> is near we see it by the Birds, whereof are
many, and also the white Bears discover it, as
you may see at <HI>g</HI> in the Tab. <HI>B,</HI> chiefly in the
Spring, when but a few <HI>Whales</HI> are caught, for
then they are greedy of their Prey; afterwards
when many <HI>Whales</HI> float on the Sea, they have
<PB N="163" REF="231"/>
their Bellies full, and we do not find so many
by a <HI>Whale,</HI> because they are dispersed.</P>

<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Trying out of the Train-oyl from▪
the Fat.</HEAD>
<P>Formerly the <HI>Dutch</HI> did try out their Train-oyl
in <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> at <HI>Smerenberg,</HI> and about
the Cookery of <HI>Harlingen,</HI> where still, for a re∣membrance,
all sorts of Tools belonging there∣unto
are to be seen, whereof I have make men∣tion
before. The <HI>French-men</HI> try up their Train-oyl
in their Ships, and by that means many
Ships are burnt at <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> and this was the
occasion of the burning of two Ships in my
time. They try out their Train-oyl at <HI>Spitz∣bergen,</HI>
that they may load the more Fat in
their Ships; and they believe it to be very pro∣fitable,
for they go their Voyage upon part,
that is to say, they receive more or less, accor∣ding
to what they catch; But I do not ac∣count
it Wisdom to fill up the room of the Ship
with Wood, where they might stow Vessels.
But our Country-men, as I told you before, put
the Fat into the Vessels, wherein it doth fer∣ment
just like Beer, and I know no instance
that ever any Vessel did fly in pieces, although
they are stopt up very close, and so it becometh
for the greatest part Train-oyl in them. Of
the fresh Fat of <HI>Whales,</HI> when it is burnt out you
lose Twenty in the Hundred, more or less, ac∣cording
<PB N="164" REF="232"/>
as it is in goodness. At the place
where they try up the Fat into Train-oyl, near
<HI>Hamburgh,</HI> they put the Fat out of the Vessels
into a great wooden Trough or Tub, and out
of this two Men empty it into a great Kettle
that stands near it, that doth hold two Cardels
of Fat, that makes 120, 130, and sometimes
140 Gallons: Underneath this Copper that is
made-up with Bricks they put the Fire, and so
they boil it, and try it up into Train-oyl, as
you try up other Fat. This Copper is very well
secured, as the Dyers Coppers use to be: it is
very broad and flat, just like a Frying-pan,
made of Copper. When the Fat is well tryed
or fryed out, they take it out of the Pan with
small Kettles, into a great Sieve, that the liquid
only may run through, the rest is thrown away.
This Sieve stands over a great Tub, which is
above half filled with cold Water, that the hot
Train-oyl may be cooled, and that what is
unclean and dirty of the Blood and other Soil
may fall to the bottom, and only the clear
Train-oyl swim at the top of the Water, like
other Oyl. In this great Tub or Trough is a
small Spout or Tap which doth run out over
another as big as a Tub, out of which the Train-oyl
runs into another Tub, when it is almost
ready to run over, which is also filled with cold
Water to the middle, wherein it is more cooled,
and becomes clearer, and more refined than it
was before. In this Trough is another Spout,
through which the Train oyl runs into the
Warehouse into a Vatt, whereout they fill it
into Cardels or Vessels. Some have but two
Tubs. A Cardel or Hogshead holds 64 Gallons.
A true Train oyl Barrel doth hold 32 Gallons.
The Greaves they try up the second time, and
<PB N="165" REF="232"/>
make brown Train-oyl out of it, others that
think it not worth their while fling them
away.</P>

<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Finn-fish.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Finn-fish</HI> is of the length of a <HI>Whale,</HI>
but in bulk the <HI>Whale</HI> is three times as big.
They know the <HI>Finn-fish</HI> by the Finns that are
upon his Back, near unto his Tail, and also by
his vehement blowing and spouting up of the
Water, which the <HI>Whale</HI> doth not do. His
Knob on the Head is split in length, that is at
his blowing hole, through which he forces up
the Water higher than the <HI>Whale,</HI> and with
more fierceness, which is not so high as that of
the <HI>Whale,</HI> neither is the Back bended or den∣ted
in so much. His Lips are of a brownish
colour, and like a twisted Rope. On his upper
Lip the Whale-bone hangs, as it doth on the
<HI>Whale;</HI> but whether he doth open and shut his
Mouth there are different Opinions: Some be∣lieve
that he cannot open his Mouth, yet this
is not true; but he doth not always run open
Mouth'd, that the Whale-bone may not hang
out of his Mouth at the sides, as it doth in
Whales, for else he can open his Mouth if he
pleases. Within his Mouth, between the
Whale-bone, he is all over hairy, like unto
Horses Hairs, which grows within to the
Whale-bone that is but new growing, and it is
<PB N="166" REF="233"/>
of a blew colour. The other Whale-bone is of
a brown colour, and dark brownish with yellow
stroaks, which are esteemed to be the oldest:
The blew Whale-bone cometh from young
Whales and Finn fishes. He is not as black as
Velvet, as the Whale is, but like a Tench.
The shape of his Body is long and small, nei∣ther
is he so fat as a Whale, wherefore we do
not much care to catch him for he doth not
pay us for our Labour. It is much more dan∣gerous
to kill him than to kill a Whale, be∣cause
he moves quicker, and beats about him
with his Tail, and from him with his Finns, so
that we dare not come near unto him with our
Sloops or Long-boats, for the Launces kill him
soonest. I was informed, that once some, be∣fore
they were aware of it, did fling, by a mi∣stake,
their Harpoon into a Finn-fish, where∣upon
he drew both Boat and Men, all on a sudden,
underneath a large Ice-sheet before they
were aware of it, and not one of them escap'd.
His Tail lies flat, like unto that of the Whale.
When these Finn-fishes appear we see no more
Whales.</P>
<P>The Train-oyl of the Whale is used by seve∣ral,
<HI>viz.</HI> by the <HI>Frize-makers, Curriers, Cloath∣workers,</HI>
and <HI>Soap-boilers;</HI> but the greatest use
that is made of it, is to burn it in Lamps instead
of other Oyl.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greenland</HI> Ships carry 30 or 40 Men, and
sometimes more, chiefly the great Ships, that
have six Sloops belonging to them, such Ships
hold from 800 to 1000 Cardels of Fat; the
less. Ships have commonly fewer Cardels or
Vessels, from 400 to 700, and have commonly
<HI>five</HI> Sloops or Boats belonging to them. There
also go Galliots to <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> to catch Whales;
<PB N="167" REF="233"/>
they have three or four Sloops belonging to
them: Some put the Sloops upon the Deck of
the Ships, others hang them overboard, as they
do at <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> when they are amongst the
Ice, that as soon as they call <HI>Fall, fall,</HI> they
may immediately let down their Sloops into
the Water.</P>
<P>Then there remains onboard in the Ships the
Steersman, the Barber, the Chyrurgion, the
Cooper, and a Boy, to look after the Ship;
the Skipper or Commander himself goeth out
with the rest of the Men, for they are all obli∣ged
to go a Whale catching.</P>
<P>In each Ship there are sixty Launces, six
Sea-horse Launces, forty Harpoons, ten long
Harpoons wherewith they strike the <HI>Whales</HI>
under Water, six small Sea-horse Harpoons,
thirty Lines or Ropes, and each of them is
about eighty or ninety fathoms long. When
they go a hunting they take along with them
into each Sloop two, and sometimes three Har∣poons,
six Launces, two or three Sea-horse
Launces, three Lines, and five or six Men, ac∣cording
to the bigness of the Sloops, therein is
the Harpoonier, Line-keeper or Giver, and the
Steersman: They all row equally, until they
come near to the <HI>Whale,</HI> except the Steersman,
for he guides the Boat with his Rudder. They
also have in each Sloop a Chopping-knife, to
cut off the Rope when they cannot follow the
<HI>Whale,</HI> and a Hammer, and other Instruments,
as Hatchets, Drags, and several sorts of Knives,
wherewithal they cut the <HI>Whales.</HI> Meat and
Drink is also given them according to the usual
Custom, he that will have better must take it
along with him. Lazy Fellows are in this
Voyage troubled with the <HI>Scurvy,</HI> but those
<PB N="168" REF="234"/>
that fear neither Air nor Wind, and bestir
themselves, escape pretty well; else the <HI>Scurvy</HI>
is the common Distemper in this Voyage, be∣sides
Feavers, Imposthumes, and other acciden∣tal
Distempers, and therefore the Chyrurgion
must take care to provide himself.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of ROtz-fishes and Sea-qualms.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Rotz-fish</HI> (or <HI>Slime-fishes)</HI> I call these, that
in themselves are nothing else but Slime,
and they are transparent. I have observed se∣veral
kinds of these, some whereof have parts
like Finns, as that same which I call the <HI>Sea
May-flye.</HI> Others are like unto the flat Snails,
only instead of Finns they have Stalks like un∣to
Feathers. Besides these, I have seen four
other sorts, that are quite differing in shape
from the others, and are called <HI>Sea-qualms</HI> by
the Seamen, as if they were a thick Scum of the
Sea coagulated together. They are also called
after the Latin Name <HI>Sea-nettles,</HI> because they
cause a burning Pain like unto Nettles. I have
formerly had some Thoughts, that the <HI>Rotz</HI> or
<HI>Slime fishes</HI> might be a Seed flung out and so pu∣trefied,
and that they did cause this burning
Pain by reason of their putrefaction; and so I did
think that they received their shape or form
according to the several kinds of Fishes from
whence they came, and that some did take after
<PB N="169" REF="234"/>
<HI>Thornbacks,</HI> others after <HI>Whales,</HI> and the like;
but this doth not seem to be agreeable to Rea∣son,
for I have considered it better since, and
find Life to be a far more boble thing, than that
it should proceed from putrefied Seed cast away.
They cleanse the Sea mightily, for all the filth
and uncleannese sticks to them, just as a Burr
doth unto Cloth.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>I. Of the Sea-May-flye.</HEAD>
<P>These small Fish are very like unto the <HI>Sea-nettles,</HI>
because of their transparent Body, and
they also dissolve like the same, if you hold them
in your hand. They have two Finns under∣neath,
about the Neck, which are likest unto
those of the <HI>Whale.</HI> They are in their shape
like unto our white Rowls, broad and thick in
the middle, and thin and pointed at each end.
As for the rest of the Body, it is very like unto
our <HI>May-flye,</HI> save only that the Tail or Body is
all along thicker, and only begins to be pointed
towards the end. The Head is broad and
round, split in the middle; it hath small horns
about the breadth of a Straw; on his Head be∣fore
it hath two rows of six red little Knobs,
three of them in each row; whether they be
Eyes or no I cannot exactly tell. Its Mouth is
divided or split. From his Mouth down into
his Belly are its Guts, which one may easily see
because of its transparency. It is of yellow
and black colour; but the colour of the whole
Fish is like unto the White of an Egg. He
moves in the Water just like a <HI>Sea-nettle.</HI> I have
drawn him here in his proper bigness. I am of
opinion, that the Birds feed upon them, be∣cause
the <HI>Lumbs, Pigeon-divers,</HI> and <HI>Parret-divers,</HI>
<PB N="170" REF="235"/>
are plentifully seen in those places where
these Fish or Sea Insects are seen. The same
that I have delineated here I found in the <HI>South
Bay</HI> in <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> on the 20th of <HI>June;</HI> in the

<HEAD>II. Of the Snail Slime-fish.</HEAD>
<P>These are also quite transparent, like unto the
<HI>Sea-nettles,</HI> but they are flat, and wound about
like a Snail, and so we find upon the Land the
She<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls of such flat Snails. It is very remarkable,
that out of the utmost part of him come two
Stalks, like unto the Beam of a pair of Scales,
hairy or rough on each side, like unto a Feather.
With these Stalks he moves himself up and
down like the <HI>Sea-nettle.</HI> They are of a brown
colour: They swim in great numbers in the
Sea, as numerous as the Dust in the Sun. It is
believed that the <HI>Whales</HI> feed upon them, but I
cannot believe that they can be so nourishing a
Food for the <HI>Whales,</HI> as to make them so fat; I
rather believe that the <HI>Lumbs, Pigeon-divers,</HI> and
the <HI>Parret-divers</HI> feed upon them. They are
not bigger than I have delineated them. We
saw many of them in the <HI>South Harbour</HI> at
<HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> on the 20th day of <HI>June,</HI> Amongst
the Ice I saw none. The Seamen take these
small Fish for <HI>Spiders,</HI> and I should also have
taken them to be such, if I had not had them

<P>Its upper part is like the Fungusses or Toad∣stools,
for it is as it were a round and thick
Stalk, that goes just into the middle of the
Head. It hath a blew Button or Knob, that is
as thick again as the Stalk: And this upper part
may also be compared unto such a Straw Hat
as our Women wear. From the Stalk down∣wards
it doth grow thick again, and round,
yet it is a great deal less than the Button.
I have seen them force themselves up from
below, and then from the top down again,
just as a Stick that is forced down underneath
the Water reboundeth up again. I got them
in the <HI>North Sea,</HI> between <HI>Holly-Land</HI> and the
<HI>Elbe,</HI> where the Sea-water mingles with that
of the <HI>Elbe.</HI> I have also seen them at <HI>Kuck's-Haven</HI>
in the <HI>Elbe.</HI> And I am also informed,
that sometimes, they come as far down as

<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>IV. Of the Rose-like-shaped Slime-fish.</HEAD>
<P>This <HI>Slime-fish</HI> is a round as a Circle, yet
in his circumference between his double strokes
a little indented. The Rays spring out sin∣gle
from the middle of the Body, and there
are sixteen of them in number, but they divide
themselves into two branches, wheer they run
somewhat closer together, and are split in two.
The Body thereof is white and transparent, as
<PB N="172" REF="236"/>
is mentioned before; he draws it together, and
opens it again as he pleaseth; but the Rays or
Spokes are brownish red. On the end of these
Spokes, towards the outward circumference are
several Spots, 32 in number. In the middle of
this Plate is another small Circle, and from the
circumference of that the before-named Spokes
begin. It is hollow within, which Cavity
may perhaps be his Belly, wherein I found
two or three of the small Shrimps. Round
about did hang down seven brown small
Threads, like spun Silk, or like unto the
Threads that flye in the Air about Autumn;
he cannot move these. I believe he weigh'd
about half a pound; he was about half a span
broad; the Threads were about a span long.
This sort we got about <HI>Hitland.</HI> One might
very well call him the <HI>Plate,</HI> or <HI>Rose-like Slime∣fish,</HI>
by reason of his figure and shape. I have
heard some relate, that the <HI>Macarels</HI> do suck
their Colour out of these two, but I cannot
affirm it, but leave it undecided, until I can
assert it by my own Experience. These three
first <HI>Sea-qualms</HI> are numerous in the <HI>North Sea</HI>
as Atomes in the Air, but about <HI>Spitzbergen</HI> we
do not find many of them. I have seen them
swim at top only in calm weather, but in stor∣my

<P>At <HI>Spitzbergen,</HI> near the <HI>Muscle-Harbour,</HI> on

I saw two sorts of <HI>Slime-fish,</HI> whereof one had
six, the other eight Corners: That with six
Corners had also six purple Streaks with blew
Brims. Between these Streaks the Body is divi∣ded
like unto a Pumpkin into six Ribs. From
the middle of his Body hang down two
Threads that are red like Vermilion, and
rough, of small Hairs, they are shaped like
unto the Letter [V]. I did not see him
move them when he swam. Within his Body
he hath other broader Streaks, of a purple co∣lour,
and on the edges or brims of a lightish
blew one; they represent themselves like un∣to
a great [W]. The whole Body is as
white as Milk, and not so transparent as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

just like a Cap with Corners, wherefore
one might call it the <HI>Cap-like</HI> Fish.</P>

this hole coem down four Strokes, two and
two, exactly opposite to one another; two of
them are cut transversedly, and two are not cut.
Those that are not cut are about half the
breadth of a Straw, and the others that are
like unto the Back<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bones of a Snake, are as
broad as a Straw; both of them come down
beyond the middle of the whole Body. From
the middle of the Funnel come down four
others, like unto the Back bones of a Snake, and
they come down lower than the others; so
that all of them make eight in number. They
changed their colour as we looked upon them,
into blew, yellow, and red, with such delicate
colours as a Rainbow. They looked in my
Eyes to be like unto a Fountain with eight
Streams or Spouts, wherefore we might call it
a <HI>Fountain-fish</HI> with eight Streams. Within him
came down from the end of the Funnel some∣thing
like a Cloud that divides itself into rows,
which I take to be his Intrails. Where the be∣fore-mentioned
outward Streaks end themselves
the Body is first bent in somewhat, then it
turns round, and there it hath many small
Streaks. The whole Body is as white as Milk,
of the same bigness as it is here delineated. I
believe it weighed about four ounces. I did not
<PB N="175" REF="237"/>
perceive that he did burn ones Skin, but he
did, like him I mentioned before, dissolve like
Slime.</P>
<P>Since I have seen other sorts of these <HI>Sea-nettles</HI>
in the <HI>Spanish Sea,</HI> that weighed several
pounds, and they were of a blew, purple, yel∣lowish,
and white colour, that burn more vio∣lently
than those of the <HI>North Sea;</HI> they suck
themselves so close to the Skin, that they
raise Blisters, and cause sometimes St. <HI>Anthony</HI>'s
<HI>Fire.</HI> The Cutts whereof, together with the
Description, I hope to communicate to the
Reader at another time. This is marked with

<HEAD>CHERRY- and other Islands.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Men conceive <HI>Greenland</HI> to be broken
ken Land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Northern Islands.</NOTE> or a great number of Islands
at least, very near to one another. On
the West side they discovered as far as
82 deg. the most Northerly Point they called
<HI>Point Purchas,</HI> there they found very many
Islands, which they thought not worthy to
give Names to, being careful only to take notice
of those six or eight Harbours which were
commodious for their Fishing. On the East
side, they went no farther than 78 deg. be∣cause
the <HI>Dutch</HI> disturbed their Trading on that
side. There are also many Islands, some of
which are named,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hope-Island.</NOTE> as <HI>Hope-Island,</HI> discovered in
1613▪ which may be that the <HI>Dutch</HI> call <HI>Wil∣loughby's-land,</HI>
or <HI>John Mayen's Island,</HI> though in∣deed
it corresponds well to neither; but rather
to the later. I belongeth to <HI>Greenland,</HI> and is
<PB N="180" REF="240"/>
but a small Island, and lies North-east and
South-west; whereas the Country Sir <HI>H. Wil∣loughby</HI>
landed upon, was a large Countrey,
(inasmuch as he sailed many days by the side
of it) and lies North and South, which must
be <HI>Greenland.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Edges-Island.</NOTE> <HI>Edges-Island</HI> was discovered 1616,
by Capt. <HI>T. Edge,</HI> who had made that Voyage
ten times. <HI>Wyches-Island</HI> (so called from a Gen∣tleman
of that Name)<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wyches-Island.</NOTE> was found out 1617,
but there being nothing remarkable come to
our knowledge concerning these, we pass them
over. Only it is worth noting, that both the
Whale and Morss-fishing was known and pra∣ctised
800 years ago, as appears by the Relation
which <HI>Octber</HI> the <HI>Norwegian</HI> made to his. Lord
<HI>Alfred</HI> King of <HI>England;</HI> where he also saith,
that the <HI>Morsses</HI> were hunted for their Teeth,
which were mightily esteemed.</P>
<P><HI>Cherry-Island,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cherry-Island.</NOTE> when first discovered I know
not, but it received not its Name, nor was
known to be of any profit till 1603, when a
Ship set out at the charges of Sir <HI>Franc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Cherry</HI>
touched upon it, and found there some Lead,
and a Morsses Tooth; but stayed not to fish,
because the year was too far spent. However,
they called it (in honour of Sir <HI>Franc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Cherry,</HI>
for whose use they took possession of it)<HI>Cherry∣Island.</HI></P>
<P>In 1604.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Morss∣fishing.</NOTE> a Ship set sail (Mr. <HI>Welden</HI> the Mer∣chant,
and <HI>Stephen Bennet</HI> the Master) from <HI>Lon∣don,
April 15,</HI> and arrived at <HI>Cola</HI> in <HI>Lapland
May I.</HI> They stayed in <HI>Lapland</HI> till <HI>July 1.</HI> and
<HI>July 8,</HI> they came in sight of <HI>Cherry;</HI> and they
came to an Anchor on the South-south-east
side, but, because of the Stream, could not land:
so that they sailed round about the Isle, and at
length anchored two miles from the Shore.
<PB N="181" REF="240"/>
Going on Land, one of them with his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
as many Fowl as almost laded their Boat.
<HI>July 9.</HI> they found on Shore nothing but store
of Foxes; that part of the Island was in 74
deg. 45 min. <HI>July 10.</HI> they weighed Anchor,
and stood into another Bay, and came to an
Anchor in eight fathoms, where they saw an
incredible number of Morsses swimming in the
Sea. Coming to shore, they espied a vast
company of them lying on the Ground; they
shot at them with three Guns they carried with
them, but with all their Weapons they could
kill but fifteen of above 1000, that lay there like
Hogs huddling together on heaps, but they
found as many Teeth as filled an Hogshead.
Before the 13th, they killed near 100 more,
making use only of their Teeth.</P>
<P>In 1605, the same persons went again, arri∣ving
there <HI>July 2.</HI> They went on Shore, and
<HI>July 6.</HI> slew abundance of Morsses, and not
only with Shot, as they did the year before,
but with Launces dexterously used, directing
them to certain places of their Bodies; they
began also to boil their Blubber, and made ele∣ven
Tuns of Oyl, (five of their Bellies will
yield one Hogshead) and abundance of Teeth.
Here also they found a Lead-mine under <HI>Mount∣misery,</HI>
and brought away about Thirty Tun of
the Oar.</P>
<P>In 1606. the same Ship with the same Per∣sons
was sent again, and landed <HI>July 3,</HI> in
74 deg. 55 min. where they stayed till the Ice
was all cleared; for the Morsses will not come
to Shore till the Ice be all vanished, where, at
one time in six hours, they slew betwixt Seven
and Eight Hundred Morsses, and Two great
<PB N="182" REF="241"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> they made 22 Tuns of Oyl, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
Hogsheads of Teeth.</P>
<P>In 1608. <HI>June 21,</HI> was so hot that the melted
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itch ran down the sides of their Ship: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
hours time they slew above 900 Morsses,
making <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Tuns of Oyl, and above 2 Hogsheads
of Teeth, besides 40 more. They took alive
into their Ship two young Morsses, a Male
and Female; the Female died, the Male lived
ten weeks in <HI>England,</HI> where they taught it
many things.</P>
<P>In 1610 at another Voyage with two Ships,
they killed many Bears, and saw divers young
ones, no bigger than young Lambs, very
gamesome and lusty; they brought-two of
them into <HI>England.</HI> Much Fowl also they
slew, and many Seals; and <HI>June 15</HI> set up an
Ensign in token of possession of the Island for
the <HI>Muscovia</HI> Company: in <HI>Gull Island</HI> they
found three Lead mines, and a Coal-mine on
the North side of the Island. Three Ships
more also came to fish at <HI>Cherry-Island,</HI> they kil∣led
500 Morsses at one time, at other times near
300 more, one Man killing 40 with his Launce
at one days hunting.</P>
<P>The Morss,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Morsses.</NOTE> Walrush, Horse-whale, Rosma∣rus,
or Sea-horse, (for so he is by the Ancients
often called, though of late they have discove∣red
another Fish not unlike him, with streight
Teeth, which they call the Sea-horse) hath a
Skin like a Sea-calf, (with short and sad yellow
Fur) a Mouth like a Lion; if any, hardly di∣scernable,
Ears, yet they hear well, and are
frighted with noise; (which also is said of the
Whale, that he is driven away with the sound
of a Trumpet) large Breast, short Thighs, four Feet,
and upon each Foot five Toes with short sharp
<PB N="183" REF="241"/>
Nails, with which they climb the Ice; and as
large as a great Ox, having a great semicircular
Tusk growing on each side of their upper Jaw,
which are very much valued, especially by the
Northern People, partly for their uses in Medi∣cines,
as to make Cramp-rings, (which they
make also of the Bristles upon his Cheeks) to
resist Poison, and other malignant Diseases,
wherein they are at least equal to that called
the Unicorn's Horn; but more for their Beau∣try,
which is equal to, if not surpassing Ivory.
The heaviness of it makes it much sought after
for Handles of Swords. Their Skins, being
dressed, are thicker than two Ox-hides, yet
light, and excellent to make Targets against
Darts and Arrows of the Savages. They feed
upon Fish and Herbs, and sleep, if there be Ice,
upon that; where if surprized, the female casts
her young ones (of which she hath commonly
two at a time) into the Sea, and her self after
them, swimming away with them in her Arms;
and if provoked, after she hath secured them,
returning many times to set upon the Boat, in∣to
which if she can fasten her Teeth, she will
easily sink it. But if they be farther from the
Water, they all arise up together, and with their
weight and force falling upon the Ice, endea∣vour
to break it; as they did when surprized
by <HI>Jonas Pool</HI> 1610, where himself and divers
of his Men escaped drowning very narrowly;
one of them being in the Sea, the Morsses set
upon him with their Teeth, but with very great
labour and hazard of his company he escaped
Death, though sore wounded. Frequently also
they sleep on the shore, and if they have con∣venience,
upon an high and steep place. They
always go in great companies, and set one to
<PB N="184" REF="242"/>
keep watch; which if surprized asleep, 'tis an
easie matter to kill all the rest; but if he give
warning by grunting, they clap their hinder
Feet under their two Tusks, and so roll into
the Sea. But if they be caught on plain ground,
yet are they hardly slain, being both strong and
fierce, and all hasting one way to the Water.
The <HI>Dutch</HI> at first were very much troubled to
kill them, their Shot the Beast valued not much,
their Hatchets and Half-pikes would not pierce
them; nor did they think they could be killed,
except struck with great force in the midst of
the Forehead. The first time they set upon
them, of 200 they could not kill one, but went
for their Ordnance to shoot them. Our Men,
after a little experience, found the way to di∣spatch
them with Javelins, as is before rehearsed.</P>
<P>Some imagine this to be <HI>John Mayen's Island,</HI>
but it seems rather that is not; for the Nor∣thermost
point of that is in 71 d. 23 m. whereas
this is 74 d. 55 m. except the <HI>Dutch</HI> be not so
accurate in their Observations and Calculations
as were to be wish'd, which I much suspect, <HI>v.
Nova-Zembla.</HI> Besides, <HI>Cherry-Island</HI> is round, not
frequented with Whales, but Morsses. Our
Men also have travelled it on Foot from North
to South, which on <HI>Mayen's Island</HI> cannot be
done; and though they tell many particulars
of the place, yet they never mention the great
<HI>Beerenberg. Hope-Island</HI> indeed is a long Island,
lies much what as they say of <HI>Mayen</HI>'s, and hath
been visited by the Whale-fishers, but it is more
North than they place their Island. The itch
of ascribing Discoveries to themselves hath
brought (as I fear) Confusion both in this and
many other matters of this nature.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="description of island">
<PB N="185" REF="242"/>
<HEAD>JOHN MAYEN's Island.</HEAD>
<P><HI>JObn Mayen's Island,</HI> so called from the name of
the first Discoverer, (as the <HI>Dutch</HI> pretend)
seems by the <HI>English</HI> to be called <HI>Hope-Island,</HI> or
if not, I know not whether the <HI>English</HI> have
been upon it. It seems not to be of any great
consequence, all that is spoken of it being that
it extends in length from South-west to North-east
The farther it shoots out in length, the
more contracted and narrower it grows in
breadth; so that in the middle the distance is
very small between both Shores. Before the
Whale-fishing was removed to <HI>Greenland,</HI> in the
Summer-time this Island was much frequented
by the Seamen whom Trade invited thither;
and the Island was well known to most of the
Northern Adventurers of <HI>Europe;</HI> but since the
Whales have deserted those Shores, and have
removed their Sea-quarters farther to the North,
the Seamen and Fishermen have been forced to
follow their Prey to <HI>Greenland.</HI> For it seems the
Whales, either weary of the place, or sensible
of their own danger, do often change their Har∣bours.
In the Spring time the western side of
the Island is not so much enclosed with Ice, as
that which lies in the North, where it runs out
into the Sea, with a sharp point behind the <HI>Moun∣tain
of Bears;</HI> for on this side, all the year long,
the Ice never removes from the Shore, above
ten miles; and in the Spring time so besieges it,
that there is no passage through it. For which
reason the Mariners, who are bound for this
Island, use all the care they can to avoid the
<PB N="186" REF="243"/>
Eastern, and to make directly to the Western
Shore, there to lye while the Fishing-season con∣tinues;
if by miscarriage they come upon the
East-side, they are then forced to fetch a com∣pass
about the North part of the Island, where∣by
they are not only exposed to the terrible winds
that blow off from <HI>Bears-Mountain,</HI> but also to
the dangers of the floating Ice: for here the Sea
flows from South to North, and ebbs from North
to South. At the Northern end of the Island
appears the <HI>Bears-Mountain,</HI> of a prodigious
height, and so perpendicularly steep, that it is
impossible to climb to the top of it. This
Mountain, from the Bears there frequently seen,
called <HI>Beerenberg</HI> or the <HI>Bears-Mountain,</HI> at the
bottom takes up the whole space beween the
Eastern and the Western Shore; on the North
side it leaves a little room for leveller ground
to the Ocean; and being of prodigious height,
may be descryed 30 miles off at Sea.</P>
<P>The Sea-coast lies thus: 1. <HI>Noords-hoeck,</HI> or
the <HI>Northern Angle,</HI> is the extream point shooting
out to the North. 2. <HI>Oosthoeck</HI> is the most
Eastern point. <HI>Ysbergh,</HI> mark'd 1, 2, 3, are three
Mountains of Ice, or rather vast heaps of con∣gealed
Snow, which dissolved by the heat of
the Sun, falls from the top of <HI>Bears-Mountain,</HI>
but upon the Sun's retiring freezes again.
3. <HI>Zuydoost-hoeck</HI> is the South-east Angle. From
this point the Shore extends itself from East to
West to a little Island, and then winds again to
the West and South; in some places not passa∣ble
by reason of its steepness, in others smooth
enough. 4. <HI>Cleyn Sand-bay</HI> or <HI>Little Sand-bay,
Eyerland,</HI> or <HI>Eggland,</HI> being certain Rocks full of
Birds; here, about a Musket shot from the
shore, the Sea is 60 fathom deep, and a little far∣ther,

the sounding line will not reach to the
bottom. 5. <HI>Groote Hoot-bay</HI> or great Wood-bay,
by reason of the great pieces of rotten Timber,
that are there found. In this, which is the nar∣rowest
part of the Island, are certain Mountains
not very steep, from the top whereof any per∣son
calling them that stand upon either shore,
may be heard by both 6. <HI>Cleyn Hoot-bay,</HI> or
<HI>Little Wood-bay.</HI> 7. <HI>English Bay,</HI> and several
others, to which the <HI>Dutch</HI> have given such
Names as they thought fit.</P>

<HEAD>GRONELAND.</HEAD>
<P>CAlled also <HI>Groenland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Name and Situa∣tion.</NOTE> <HI>Groinland,</HI> and more
anciently <HI>Engroenland,</HI> lies (as the Islan∣ders
say) like an Half-moon about the North of
their Countrey, at the distance of four days
sailing. But it seems not to lye so much East,
but rather on the North of <HI>America.</HI> From <HI>Cape
Farewell,</HI> in 60 deg. 30 min. on the South, it is
unknown to how many degrees in the North.
The East and West are encompass'd by two
great. Oceans, but at what degrees of Longitude
is not yet discover'd. Only Mr. <HI>Fotherby</HI> found
it near the Coast of <HI>Groneland,</HI> in 71 deg. and
the South of <HI>Greenland</HI> to be above two hundred
Laeagues.</P>
<P>It is said to have been discovered first by a
<HI>Norwegian</HI> Gentleman,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ancient Discoveries</NOTE> whose Name was <HI>Eric
Rotcop,</HI> or <HI>Red Head;</HI> who having committed a
Murther in <HI>Iseland,</HI> to save his Life, resolved a
adventure to andother Country, whereof he had
<PB N="188" REF="245"/>
heard some obscure flying Reports. He succee∣ded
so well, that he arrived in a safe Harbour
called <HI>Sandstasm,</HI> lying between two Mountai∣nous
Promontories; the one upon an Island
over against <HI>Groneland,</HI> which he called <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idser∣ken,</HI>
on <HI>Wbite Sbirs,</HI> because of the Snow upon
it: the other on the Continent, called <HI>Huarf
Eric.</HI> He winter'd in the Island, but when the
season suffer'd pass'd into the Continent: which
because of its greenness and flourishing he called
<HI>Groneland.</HI> Thence he sent his Son to <HI>Ola<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Trugger</HI> King of <HI>Norway,</HI> to get his Pardon,
which was easily granted, when he was inform'd
by him of this new Discovery. Whereupon
divers Gentlemen adventur'd to plant there, who
multiplying, not long after divided the whole
Country into the Easten and Western, and
built two Cities, <HI>Garde</HI> and <HI>Albe.</HI> In <HI>Albe</HI> was
a Bishop's See, and a Cathedral Church dedica∣ted
to St. <HI>Anthony;</HI> the Seat also of the Viceroy
sent thither from time to time by the <HI>Norwegian.</HI>
They write also of a great Monastery called of
St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> wherein was a Spring, whose Water
was so hot, that it dressed all their Meat; and
being conveyed into the Cells and other Rooms
in Pipes, heated all the Monastery as if it had
been so many Stoves. They say also, that this
Monastery is built all of Pumice-stones, and
that this hot Water falling upon them, mixeth
with the outer parts, and produces a sort of
clammy matter, which serves instead of Lime.</P>
<P>But what the <HI>Norwegians</HI> conquered or pos∣sessed
in this Country was an inconsiderable
corner of that large Continent.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>By the</HI> Norwegians.</NOTE> Themselves
mention a Nation, whom they call <HI>Skrelingers,</HI>
to have inhabited in the middle of the Land,
<PB N="189" REF="245"/>
but what they were we know not. But whe∣ther
their Paucity exposed them to the merci∣lesness
of the Natives, or whether it were an
Epidemical Disease, which they called the <HI>black
Plague,</HI> which swept away not only most of
that Nation in <HI>Groneland,</HI> but also the Mer∣chants
and Meriners in <HI>Norway,</HI> that maintai∣ned
that Traffick; or whether it were some
other Reason, which is now forgotten: so it is,
that since 1349, little Intelligence hath descen∣ded
to us concerning <HI>Groneland,</HI> till seeking the
North-west passage to <HI>China,</HI> occasioned more
knowledge of it. In 1389. they say, that the
King of <HI>Denmark</HI> sent a Fleet thither, with in∣tention
to re-establish his Dominion in those
parts; but that being cast away, discouraged
him from any further Enterprize; till new of
late <HI>Christian</HI> IV. renewed somewhat again of
that Navigation, of which by and by. In
1406. the Bishop of <HI>Drontheim</HI> sent a Priest
(called <HI>Andreas</HI>) to succeed <HI>Henry</HI> Bishop of
<HI>Garda,</HI> if dead; if alive, to return and bring
notice of the stute of the Church there. But
<HI>Andreas</HI> never came back; nor hath there been
since any further care taken to supply Bishops,
or maintain Christianity there. There is a
Relation in <HI>Purchas</HI>'s Pilgrim, <HI>par.</HI> 3. of one
<HI>Ivor Boty a Gronelander,</HI> translated 1560, out of
the <HI>Norweighish</HI> Language, which gives a suffici∣ently
particular account of all the places in that
Country inhabited by Christians, but nothing
besides.</P>
<P>The occasion of our Voyages to those Coast
was to find out a way to <HI>China,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Later Dis∣coveries by the English.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by the
North-west, which had been fruitlesly sought
toward the North-east.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="246"/>
The first whom we read to have searched the
North-west for a passage, was <HI>Martyn Frobisher,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>Martin Frobisher.</HI></NOTE>
who in 1576, with two Barks coming to the
height of 62 deg. found a great Inlet, called by
him <HI>Forbisher</HI>'s <HI>Straits,</HI> whereinto having sailed
60 leagues with main Land on either side, re∣turned.
He found there a certain Oar, which
he conceived to be of Gold; and the next year
he made a second Voyage to fetch a quantity
of it, but it proving to be nothing but black
Lead, answer'd not expectation; yet they found
a Silver Mine, which lay so deep and fast in
the Rocks, that they could not dig it. They
melted Gold also, but in very small quantities,
out of several Stones they found there upon
<HI>Smith</HI>'s Isle. They found also a dead Fish, of
about twelve foot long, not unlike in shape to a
Porpoise, having an Horn six foot long (such as
is commonly called Unicorn's Horn) growing
out of his Snout, which is still kept at <HI>Windsor.</HI>
In 1578. he went out again upon a Discove∣ry,
wherein passing as far as he thought good,
he took possession of the Land in the name of
Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> calling it <HI>Meta incognita.</HI></P>
<P>In 1583.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sir</HI> Hum. Gilbert.</NOTE> Sir <HI>Humphrey Gilbert</HI> upon the same
design went to the great River of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI>
in <HI>Canada,</HI> took possession of the Countrey, and
setled a Fishing-trade there. This Voyage I
suppose was made upon suggestion of a <HI>Greek</HI>
Mariner, who assured some of our Nation, that
himself had passed a great Strait, North of <HI>Vir∣ginia,</HI>
from the West or South Ocean, and offe∣red
to be Pilot for the Discovery, but died be∣fore
he came into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="246"/>
In 1585.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Davi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI></NOTE> Mr. <HI>John Davis</HI> was employ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> with
two Barks to the same search. The first Land
he came to, he named the <HI>Land of Desolation,</HI>
and is one part of <HI>Groneland;</HI> then he arrived
in 64 deg. 15 min. in <HI>Gilbert</HI>'s Sound, where
they found a great quantity of that Oar which
<HI>Frobisher</HI> brought into <HI>England,</HI> and also <HI>Lapis
Specularis.</HI> Thence they went to 66 deg. 40
min. to <HI>Mount Raleigh, Totness Sound, &amp;c.</HI> where
they saw some few low Shrubs, but nothing else
worth noting.</P>
<P>In 1586. he made a second Voyage to the
same place, where he found amongst the Na∣tives
Copper Oar, as also black and red Copper.
Thence they searched many places Westward,
and returned with good hopes of discovering
the desired passage.</P>
<P>In 1587. he made a third Voyage, to 72 deg.
12 min. the Compass varying to 82 deg. West∣ward,
the Land they called <HI>London-Coast;</HI> and
there they found an open Sea, and forty leagues
between Land and Land, thinking this to be the
most likely place to find the passage; and it was
from him called <HI>Fretum Davis.</HI></P>

hopes of a passage to the <HI>Indies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr.</HI> Hud∣son.</NOTE> but for the pro∣fit
of Trading; till Mr. <HI>Hudson,</HI> in 1610, after
he was satisfied that there was no passage North∣easterly,
was sent to make a Tryal here also. He
proceeded an hundred leagues farther than any
before had done; and gave Names to certain
places, as <HI>Desire-provokes, Isle of God's Mercies,
<PB N="192" REF="247"/>
Prince Henry's Cape, King James's Cape, Queen
Ann's Cape,</HI> and the like; but the Ice hindered
him from going further, and the Sedition of his
Men from returning home.</P>
<P>In 1612.<NOTE PLACE="marg">James Hall.</NOTE> <HI>James Hall</HI> returning into <HI>England,</HI>
and with him <HI>Willian Baffin,</HI> who discovored
<HI>Cockin's Sound,</HI> in-the height of 65 deg. 20 min.
which differed in Longitude from <HI>London</HI> 60
deg. 30 min. Westward. They saw also the
footing of a great Beast they supposed in Elk, or
the like. <HI>James Hall</HI> was killed in the Boat by
a Native pretending to trade with them. They
tryed the Mine at <HI>Cunningham</HI>'s River, which
the <HI>Danes</HI> had digged before, and found it to be
nothing worth. There were Rocks of very
pure Stone, finer and whiter that Alabaster, and
Angelica growing plentifully in many places,
which the Savages use to eat.</P>
<P>In 1615.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Baffin.</HI></NOTE> Mr. <HI>Baffin</HI> was sent again; he found
<HI>Fair-Point</HI> to differ in Longitude from <HI>London</HI>
74 deg. and 5. min. Westward. But the chief
thing they discover'd was, that there was no
passage in the North of <HI>Davis Straits,</HI> it being
no other than a great Bay; but that profit
might be made by fishing for Whales, Morsses,
and Unicorns, of which there are good store.</P>
<P>In 1616. Mr. <HI>Baffin</HI> went again. In Sir <HI>Tho.
Smith</HI>'s Sound, 78 deg. Lat. their Compass va∣ried
56 deg. Westward, the greatest variation
that is any where known. Despairing to disco∣ver
their desired North-west passage, they retur∣ned
home, and since that we hear of no more
Voyages made from <HI>England</HI> upon that design,
except by Capt. <HI>James,</HI> in 1631.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="247"/>
This Ingenious and most Skilful Navigator,
Capt. <HI>Theo. James</HI> was pester'd with much Ice
in these North-west Seas in <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July,</HI>
sailing from <HI>Cape-Farewell,</HI> by the Island of <HI>Reso∣lution,</HI>
to <HI>Mill</HI>'s and <HI>Nottingham Isles,</HI> as also that
call'd <HI>Mansfield,</HI> from whence he steer'd over a
great Bay to the Westward, near <HI>Port-Nelson,</HI>
and named the Land <HI>New South-Wales.</HI> He
met hereabouts with Capt. <HI>Fox,</HI> in one of his
Majesty's Ships, who had been in <HI>Port-Nelson,</HI>
but they were soon parted by bad weather.
Capt. <HI>James</HI> continued to roving up and down
these Seas, and giving Names to his Discoveries,
as <HI>Cape Henrietta Maria, Lord Weston's Island, The
Earl of Bristol's Island, Sir Thomas Roe's Island,
Earl of Danby's Island, Charlton Island,</HI> where he
winter'd in the Lat. of 52 deg. 03 min. from
whence he returned home in 1632. having
built a little Pinnace out of his Ship, in which
he passed over to <HI>Cary's Swans-Nest,</HI> and so by
<HI>Cape Charles</HI> and <HI>Salisbury-Isle</HI> homewards, ha∣ving
made many additional Discoveries beyond
<HI>Hudson, Button,</HI> and <HI>Baffin.</HI></P>
<P>This Island (saith Capt. <HI>James</HI>) and all the
rest (as well as the Main) is a light white Sand,
cover'd over with a white Moss, and full of
Shrubs and low Bushes, excepting some bare
Hills and Patches, where the Sand will drive
with the Wind like Dust. 'Tis full of Trees,
as <HI>Spruce Firrs,</HI> and <HI>Juniper,</HI> which together with
the Moss will take fire like Torches or Flax.
We found great store of an Herb like <HI>Scurvy-grass,</HI>
which boil'd, did extreamly refresh us.
We saw some Deer, abundance of Foxes, a few
Bears, and some little Beasts. In <HI>May</HI> there
came some Fowl, as Ducks and Geese; white
<PB N="194" REF="248"/>
Partridges we saw; Fish we could never see
any in the Sea, nor any Bones of Fish on the
Shore side, excepting a few Cockle-shells. The
<HI>Muskitoes</HI> upon our coming away in <HI>July</HI> were
most intolerable, there being no Fence against
them. The Climate (of the <HI>Isle of Charleton</HI>) is
most unnatural, the Days in Summer being ex∣cessive
hot, and the Nights sharp Frosts, even to
an inch thickness in the Ponds, and all this in
<HI>June</HI> and <HI>July.</HI> Here are divers sorts of Flies,
as Butter-flies, Butchers-flies, Horse-flies, infi∣nite
numbers of Ants and Frogs, plenty of
Vetches, which recover'd our Scorbutick Men.
And yet that which is most wonderful, the
Winter is as severe here as in any place lying
30 degrees more Northerly.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Denmark</HI> also, partly to advance
the Trading of his own,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By the <HI>Danes.</HI></NOTE> and partly to renew
his ancient Pretence to that Country, if any
thing should be discover'd worth the claiming,
whilst the <HI>English</HI> were busie in these Discove∣ries,
set out two Ships and a Pinnace 1605. the
Admiral was Capt. <HI>John Cunningham</HI> a <HI>Scot,
Godske Lindenaw</HI> a noble <HI>Dane</HI> was Vice Admi∣ral,
the chief Pilots were <HI>James Hall</HI> and
<HI>John Knight, Englishmen. Godske</HI> arrived on
some part of the Countrey where he traffick'd
some small matters with the Natives, took two
of them, and returned into <HI>Denmark.</HI> The
other two Ships arrived at <HI>Cape Farewell,</HI> thence
went to <HI>Frobisher's Straits,</HI> gave <HI>Danish</HI> Names to
divers places, traded with the Natives, of whom
they brought away three, and found certain
Stones in a place called <HI>Cunningham's Ford,</HI> out
of an hundred pound of which were extracted
twenty-six ounces of fine Silver.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="248"/>
In 1606. he sent again four Ships and a Pin∣nace,
<HI>Godske Lindenaw</HI> Admiral, and <HI>James Hall</HI>
Pilot-General, they brought away five of the
Natives.</P>
<P>In 1607. <HI>James Hall</HI> was sent again, but the
Seamen mutining as soon as he came to the
Coast, brought the Ship back again into <HI>Den∣mark,</HI>
without any thing done.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Denmark</HI> set out two Ships
more, under <HI>Christian Richardson</HI> an <HI>Holsteiner,</HI>
with <HI>Norwegian</HI> and <HI>Iselandish</HI> Mariners, who re∣turned
before they saw Shore. More of their
Expeditions we know not, till 1619, when he
sent out <HI>John Munck</HI> with two Ships. They ar∣rived
safe at <HI>Cape Farewell</HI> 60 deg. 30 min.
where their Tackle was so frozen, and full of
Isicles, that they could not handle them; the
next day was so hot; that they could not endure
their Clothes, but wrought in their shirts. The
South part of <HI>Hudson's Bay</HI> he called <HI>Mare No∣vum;</HI>
that part towards <HI>Groneland, Mare Chri∣stianum.</HI>
He arriv'd in 63 deg. 20 min. where
he winter'd, and called it <HI>Munck's Winter-harbour,</HI>
and the Country <HI>New Denmark,</HI> (it seems to be
near <HI>Digg's Island.</HI>) In that long Winter he
there endured, little of note happen'd, but that
in <HI>April</HI> it rained, and then came thither vast
quantities of Fowls, of divers sorts, to breed in
those quiet, undisturbed places. Of all his
Company, which was forty-six in one Ship,
and sixteen in the Pinnace, scarce so many
were left alive, as were able to bring the Pin∣nace
thorow very horrid dangers, to their own
Country.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="249"/>
If any one desire to know what became of
the eight <HI>Gronelanders</HI> brought at several times
into <HI>Denmark,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gronelan∣ders <HI>in</HI> Denmark.</NOTE> the account is this: The King
commanded great care should be taken of them,
appointed certain persons to attend them, to
give them liberty enough, so as they prevented
their escape. No Necessary or Convenience
was wanting; their Food such as they could eat,
Milk, Butter, Cheese, Flesh, and Fish, but raw.
They could eat no Bread, nor boil'd Meat, but
nothing so much abhorr'd by them as Wine, or
Brandy. Their pleasantest Beuvrage was Train-Oyl.
But whatever was done to, or for them,
could never take away that Melancholy and
Chagrin which they continually lived in for
the want of their beloved Country. They
could never be brought to learn much of the
<HI>Danish</HI> Language, or to apprehend any thing of
Christian Religion. Three of them were sent
back towards their own Country 1606. the most
towardly and hopeful, who might serve for In∣terpreters
and Brokers to the <HI>Danes;</HI> but two of
them, <HI>Oxo</HI> and <HI>Omeg,</HI> died in the Ship, and the
third (because the <HI>Danes</HI> durst not land or trade
by reason of the great numbers of Natives that
appeared in Arms on the Coast, ready to re∣venge
them that had been before carried away)
was brought back into <HI>Denmark,</HI> to his former
Treatment. An Ambassador arriving there
from <HI>Spain,</HI> the King was pleased to shew him
those Savages, and their dexterity in rowing,
which was by all the Spectators admired. The
Ambassador sending them Money, one of them
had the courage to buy him Clothes after the
<HI>Danish</HI> Fashion, got a Feather in his Cap, Boots
and Spurs, and all things <HI>ala cavaliere;</HI> he came
<PB N="197" REF="249"/>
also to the King, and desired to serve him; but
this fervor was quickly decay'd, and the poor
man returned to his sadness and complaints.
Some of them endeavoured to get to Sea in their
little Boats, but being retrieved, dyed of Me∣lancholy.
Two lived divers years at <HI>Koldingen</HI>
in <HI>Jutland,</HI> where they were employ'd in diving
for Pearl-Muscles; in which their skill and
dexterity was such, that every one that saw them
believed they had practised the same employ∣ment
in their own Country. Such fuccess they
had, that the Governour promised himself great
Profit thereby; and that in a short time he
should sell Pearls by the quart, if they continued.
But his Covetousness destroyed his Gain; for
not content with what they fished in Summer,
he also compelled them under the Ice in Win∣ter
time; where one of them fell into such a
Disease, from the cold so contracted, that he
dyed. After whose death the other never en∣joyed
himself; but finding an opportunity, he
got his little Boat, and before he was overtaken
got to the main Sea. But being brought back,
they represented to him the impossibility of his
ever getting home to <HI>Groneland;</HI> but he slighted
their Advice, and told them, That he intended
to go northward so far, and when he was there
the Stars would direct him into his own
Country.</P>
<P>The Country is mostly all High-land and
Mountains, cover'd with Snow all the Year, but
the southern parts more than the northern.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Soil, &amp;c. of <HI>Groneland</HI></NOTE>
They have very little or no Wood growing
there, except some few Bushes, and not many
Plants or Herbs; consequently not many Beasts
<PB N="198" REF="250"/>
there nourished, but their chief subsistence is
upon Fishing. There are divers Mountains,
which promise rich Mines of Metal; and some
have been found to contain it actually, others
only to make a shew. The Inhabitants know
neither sowing nor planting; tho' the Soil
seem'd to be fertile and pleasant, especially be∣tween
the Mountains. The northern parts, by
reason of the terrible Ice and Cold, are wholly
undiscover'd; the southern consist of many
Islands, different in shapes and bigness: which
seems to be the reason, that in these Seas are
many various and strong currents, and (as <HI>Ivor
Boty</HI> saith) very many dangerous Whirlpools
towards the West and North, none of which
however have been found by our Mariners.
The Country seems much subject to Earth∣quakes,
else very healthful; only it was obser∣ved,
that those who went thither infected with
any Venereal Disease grew worse immediately,
and could not there be cured. Which they at∣tributed
to the purity of the Air, perhaps they
might have done it more rationally to the
Cold.</P>
<P><HI>Ivor Boty</HI> speaks much also of their great
numbers of Cows and Sheep;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beasts.</NOTE> but our Men
found no Beasts there, but Bears, Foxes, (very
many of which are black) Rain-Deer, and
Dogs, whereof are two sorts, a bigger, which
they use to draw their Sleds; and a lesser,
which they feed for their Tables. Our Men
observed this peculiarity both in their Foxes
and Dogs, that their Pizzles were of Bone.
Tho' it is very likely, that there are the same
sorts which are in <HI>Lapland</HI> and <HI>Sam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ieda;</HI> but
<PB N="199" REF="250"/>
our Men have not searched any more than the
Shores, both because of their short stay, and the
Treachery of the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>Of Fishes there is great both Plenty and Va∣riety,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fishes.</NOTE>
Whales, Seals Dog-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish; but in these are
caught the greatest quantity of Sea Unicorns,
whose Horns are so much esteemed, and kept
as Rarities in the Cabinets of Princes. The
Natives here are so well stored with it, that
they have sufficient both for truck and their
own use. They make of them (besides other
Utensils) Swords, and Heads for their Darts
and Arrows; which they work and grind with
Stones, till they make them as sharp-piercing as
ours. This Horn grows in the Snout of the
Fish, and is his Weapon, wherewith he fears
not to fight the Whale, and to assault and some∣times
endanger a Ship. The Fish itself is as
large as an Ox, very strong, swift, and hard to
be caught, except left on the Shore by the Tide,
or entangled by the Weeds.</P>
<P>Fowls are here in great abundance and varie∣ty.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fowls.</NOTE>
Our Men have seen those they call <HI>Bass-Geese,</HI>
or such as once a year come to breed in
the <HI>Bass,</HI> a famous Rock or Island near <HI>Edin∣burgh.</HI>
The Natives also have a very great Art
and Dexterity in making and setting Snares and
Springs to catch them; which they do chiefly
for their Skins and Feathers. Two or three of
our Men with their Guns killed in one day
Fifteen hundred, and found them worse tasted,
but better clothed than those of the same kind
in these Countries; they could not eat them
till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ay'd, their Skins being very thick, tough,
<PB N="200" REF="251"/>
and more cover'd with Feathers; which also
were not easily pluck'd off; which is the reason
that the Natives dress their Skins as they do
those of Beasts, and Seals, and make Garments
of them, using them to all purposes like other
Furrs; with the Feathers outward in Summer,
inward in Winter: which is also observed in
all other cold Countries, as well as <HI>Groneland.</HI></P>
<P>All Persons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the North light</NOTE> that have been there, give a
wonderful and strange account of a certain
<HI>North-light,</HI> as they call it, not easily conceived
by them who have not seen it. It appears usu∣ally
about the time of the new Moon, and tho'
only in the North, yet doth it enlighten the
whole Country: sometimes also <HI>Norway, Iseland,</HI>
and even these Regions of ours, as <HI>Gassendus
(vita Piresk, &amp; exercit. In Doctorem Flud)</HI> saith,
himself observed, and at large describes. Nor
should I much doubt to affirm, that it is that
which is sometimes seen in <HI>England,</HI> and especi∣ally
in the Northern parts, call'd <HI>Streaming.</HI> It
is said to be like a great Pillar (or Beam) of
Fire, yet darting out Rays and Streams every
way, moving also from place to place, and lea∣ving
behind it a Mist or Cloud; continuing
also till the Sun-beams hide it.</P>
<P>The Country seems to be inhabited by di∣vers
Nations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Division of the Country.</NOTE> differing in habit, manners, and
language. Those whom <HI>James Hall</HI> found and
brought with him, differed much from those
with whom <HI>Gotske Lindenaw</HI> had to do. That
part which the <HI>Norwegians</HI> are said to have an∣ciently
possessed, was an inconsiderable part of
that whole Country, and they found several
<PB N="201" REF="251"/>
Nations there besides themselves; govern'd by
several Kings; tho' they write not, that they
had Wars one with another, but only against
them. Our late Discoverers in 66 deg. 50 min.
found a Country which the Natives (as they
could understand them) called <HI>Secanunga,</HI> who
also said, that they had a great King, carried
upon Mens Shoulders, and they called him <HI>Ca∣chico.</HI>
But more particulars than these, I find
not.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are generally of a low sta∣ture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inhabitants</NOTE>
black hair, flat nos'd, broad fac'd, lips tur∣ned
up, and of a ripe Olive colour, some of
them also quite black. Their Women (for their
greater ornament doubtless) stain their saces in
blew, and sometimes in black streaks, which
colour they let into the Skin, by pricking it
with a sharp Bone, that it will never be taken
nor worn out. In all things they resemble the
<HI>Samoieds</HI> and <HI>Laplanders.</HI> They are very active
and strong, yet could some of our <HI>English</HI> run
swifter, and leap farther than any of them; but
they were hard enough for any of ours at
wrastling. They are also very couragious, and
sometimes desperate; for rather than be taken
by our Men, they would throw themselves
down the Rocks and Mountains. Extreamly
thievish, treacherous, and revengeful they pro∣ved;
nor could any kindness or fair-dealing
win them; but as true Barbarians, never omit∣ted
any opportunity of fulfilling their Desires;
they would steal when they saw the Mariners
look upon them. After they had been well
used and treated at their Tables, they would
shoot at, sling Stones, wound and kill our Men,
<PB N="202" REF="252"/>
if they could. Yet are they apprehensive
enough, and quickly conceive yours, and ex∣press
their own meaning. If they had not seen
what was asked them, they winked, or cover'd
their Eyes; if they understood not, stopt their
Ears, and the like. They delight exceedingly
in Musick, to which they would keep time both
with their voice, hands, and feet: wonderful
also affectionate one to another, and to their
Country. In one Voyage there went a <HI>Danish</HI>
Mariner, with black hair, flat nos'd, and other,
though not very exact, resemblances of a <HI>Grone∣lander;</HI>
as soon as they saw him, they came
about him, kissed him, hung upon him, and
shewed to him all possible demonstrations of
Kindness and Affection. And those who were
in <HI>Denmark</HI> never enjoy'd themselves, nor had
any content, but continually pined away, and
languish'd with Discontent for their condition,
and love of their country. Their Religion,
such as it is, seems to be unto the Sun; for
when our People invited them to conversation,
bartering, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they held up their hands towards
the Sun, and cried <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>otan;</HI> nor would they
come near us, till our men had done the like.
But <HI>John Munck,</HI> and divers others, having gone
farther into the country, found images, such as
we make of Devils, with horns, beaks, claws,
cloven feet, <HI>&amp;c</HI> very ill made; Altars also and
quantities of Bones of Beasts, as of Deer, Foxes,
Dogs, and the like, near unto them. They
seem also, as all Idolaters, given to Enchant∣ments
and Sorceries. Our men have seen them
lying flat upon the Earth, and muttering their
Prayers or Charms into the Ground, worship∣ing
the Devil, whose proper habitation they
<PB N="203" REF="252"/>
conceive to be under them. In some Diseases
they tye a stick to a great stone, to which they
pay their Devotions; and if they can lift it up
easily and lightly, they think their Prayers are
heard, and Recovery granted. In Winter they
retire from the Sea side, unto the warmer Val∣leys,
where they have their Houses and Towns,
which are commonly Caves at the foot of an
hill, round like an Oven, close to one another,
and passage in the inner parts from one to ano∣ther;
their Doors, which are low and round,
open to the south; and they dig trenches also
to draw away the water that falls or drains from
the hill. The entrance, and some part of their
house, stands without the cave, which they
frame very handsomly and commodiously of
the ribs of Whales join'd artificially at the top,
and cover'd with Seals skins. They raise also
one part of their floor higher than another,
which they strow with moss to sleep upon. But
in their fishing-time they have Tents, which
they remove from place to place in their larger
Boats. They set up four Poles, and cover them
with Skins, which serves very well in summer:
when fishing is done, they return with them to
their Houses. Their manner of bartering, is
to make two heaps, one of such things as they
desire, the other of what they would part with;
and they cease not to take away from the one
or other, till the Trade is ballanced. The
chiefest things of our which they valued▪ were
Knives, Needles, little pieces of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oon, Looking
glasses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for these they would sell their; B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wg
and Arrows; their Boaid, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rip bhem?sewes of
their Clothes, but never, like some other Barba∣rians,
sell their Wives and Children.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="253"/>
Their clothing is either of Birds-skins,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Cloa∣thing.</NOTE> with
the Feathers and Down upon them, or Seals,
Dogfish, or the like. Seals they use most in their
fishing, because that fish there abounds, and are
easily deceived, by seeing one clad▪ in their own
Livery: besides, that these kind of Furs are
not so apt to be wet, though dip'd in Water.
They wear the hair sides outward in summer,
inward in winter, and in great colds carry two
or more suits one upon another. They dress
their Skins very well, making them dry, soft,
and durable, and sow them also very strong with
Sinews of Beasts, and Needles made of Fish∣bones.</P>
<P>But in nothing do they shew so much Art,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Boats</NOTE>
as in their Boats or Canoes. They are made
of that we call Whalebone, about in inch thick
and broad, and these not set like ribs, but all
along from prow to poop, fast sowed to one
another with strong Sinews, and covered over
with Seals-skin. They are from ten to twenty
foot long, and about two foot broad, made like
a Weaver's Shutle, sharp at both ends, so that
he can row either way; and in making this
pointedness they are of all things most curious,
for therein consists the strength of their Vessel.
In the middle of it are the ribs, both to keep
the sides asunder, and to make the hole in the
covering, wherein the Rower sits. They have
a deck made of the same materials, which is
closely fasten'd to the sides, in the midst where∣of
is a round hole, as big as the middle of a
Man; so that when he goes to Sea, he sets
himself in that hole, stretching out his feet for¦ward
<PB N="205" REF="253"/>
into the hollow of the Boat; he stops up
the hole so close with his frock, or loose upper
garment, that no water can enter, tho' it were
in the bottom of the Sea. His frock is strait
tyed at the hand-wrists, and to his neck, and
his capouch sowed also close to it; so that if
the Boat be overturned or overwhelmed in the
Sea, he rises up again, without any wet either
upon his Skin or in his Boat. They have but
one Oar, which is about six foot long, with a
paddle six inches broad at either end; this
serves him both to ballance his Boat and move
it; which he doth with that incredible sceleri∣ty,
that one of our Boats with ten Oars is not
able to keep company with them: The <HI>Danish</HI>
relation saith, that they rowed so swift, that
they even dazled the Eyes of the Spectators;
and tho' they crossed frequently, yet never in∣terfered
or hit one another.</P>
<P>Their fishing ordinarily is darting;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Fish∣ing.</NOTE> their darts
are long, strongly barbed, and at the other end
have Bladders fastened to them, that when they
have struck the Fish, he may spend himself with
strugling to get under water, which yet he can∣not
do, and so is easily taken.</P>
<P>Besides these, they have greater Boats for the
removing their Tents and other Utensils, as also
to carry their Fish they have caught to their
Houses; these are thirty and forty foot long,
and have sometimes ten, and sometimes more
seats for Rowers. Cardinal <HI>Bembus</HI> (in his <HI>Ve∣netian</HI>
History) saith, that in his time one of
these, with seven Persons in it, was by storm cast
upon the coast of <HI>Britany.</HI> I know not whether
<PB N="206" REF="254"/>
it be worth mentioning, that they have Kettles
and Pans made of Stone (some say of Load∣stone)
that endures the fire wonderfully, but
not having tools fit to hollow them sufficiently,
they make up the edges of Whalebone.</P>

<P>LIeth in 60 deg. more westerly than any part

It is reported in bigness not to be much lesser
than <HI>England;</HI> a ragged and high land, the

full of drift Ice, that it is almost inaccessible.</P>
<P>It was first discovered to us by <HI>Nicolao</HI> and

that salt water doth not freeze, but that all the
Ice they find in the Sea comes from the Bays,
and mouths of fresh-water Rivers; for the ice
it self is sweet and fresh, being dissolved, and
serves to all purposes, as well as Spring or River
water. Besides, the salt Sea (they say) is always
in motion, and so cannot freeze. But the <HI>Dutch,</HI>
who winter'd in <HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> took notice, that
the salt water freez'd, and that two inches thick
in one night.</P>
<P>There seems to be good fishing every
where upon the coast. In their soundings they
brought up a sort of pale Coral, and little Stones
clear as Crystal. They call'd it <HI>West England,</HI>
and one of the highest mountains they called
<HI>Charing-Cross.</HI></P>
