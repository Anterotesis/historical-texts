<HEAD>A new and large Discourse, of the <HI>Trauelles of Sir Anthonie Sherley</HI> Knight, by Sea, and ouer Land, to the Persian Empire.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T hath béene, and yet is, a pro∣uerbiall spéech amongst vs, that
<HI>Trauellers may lie by authority;</HI> Now, whether this Prouerbe hath had authoritie, from that authority, which some Trauel∣lers haue vsurped (neuer by iu∣stice granted) to lie; or whether their report (albeit most true) yet excéeding the beliefe of those auditors that wil beléeue nothing that falles not within their owne ocular experi∣ence, or probabilitie of truth, squared by the same: whe∣ther (I say) from one, or both of these grounds, this pro∣uerb hath sprung, I am vncertaine: but certaine I am, diuerse there are (entiteling themselues Trauellers, for crossing the narrow seas, to the neighbour partes of Pi∣cardie peraduenture, or the lowe countries perhappes) from thence take authoritie to vtter lies in England (at their returne) by retaile, which they haue coyned there in grosse. And as sure I am, that many honest and true Trauellers, for speaking the truth, of their owne know∣ledge (for in the world are many incomprehensible mi∣racles
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>of Nature) yet because it excéeds the beliefe of the vnexperienced, &amp; home-bred vulgars, they are, by them, concluded liers for their labour. How could a man, from his birth confined in a dungeon or lightlesse Caue, be brought to conceiue, or beléeue the glorie and great mag∣nificence of the visible, celestiall, and terrestriall globes, with the wonderfull workes of the great Author of Na∣ture in the same? Nay, were such a one sodainely trans∣ferred to the toppe of some mountaine or lofty Turret in a sommers day, from whence he might beholde the glory of the heauens, replenished with that most admirable Cresset, who for his glittring and diuine glory, prouokes many nations of the world to performe diuine adoration therevnto. To sée (I say) those resplendant and cristal∣line heauens ouer-cannoping the earth, inuested most sumptuously in height of Natures pride with her richest liuery; the particularities whereof, were they described according to the trueth of their nature, it might bréede a scruple in the naturall man, whether Man were (for transgression) euer vnimparadized or no. And such a man, of whome I speake, woulde (like a soule sodainely transferred, by the handes of Angells, from earth to hea∣uen) be beheauened with the ioy he would conceiue, by reason of so glorious a prospect, and such soule-rauishing and sense-bewitching obiectes. The application héereof is apparant: for were men méerely home-bred (and in that respect but as the man confined to his Caue) abroad in the eminent and oppulent places of the world, as also in the most remote and obscure corners of the same, and there with insearching and well discerning eies, to be∣hold the rarieties (surmounting admiration) therein in∣cluded, he would (no doubt) be rapt vp with ceaselesse wonderment, or wondrous amazement at the sight and consideration of them. For mine owne part, I am resol∣ued to make a true relation of what mine eies saw, not
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>respecting the iudgement of the vulgars, but contenting my selfe with the conscience of the truth; besides which, (I protest) I purpose to write nothing. This by way of preamble: now to the matter.</P>
<P>Therefore, first landing at <HI>Vlishing,</HI> we were honou∣rably receiued and entertained, of sir <HI>Robert Sidney,</HI> lord Gouernour of that garrison: from whence we went on foote to
<HI>Middleborough,</HI> where we tooke a small hoy that caried vs that night to
<HI>Sierichzee.</HI> From whence we then tooke our iourney to <HI>Somerdicke:</HI> From whence wee likewise crosst the water the next morning, and at night we lay at <HI>Brill.</HI> Hitherto we passed on foote, hiering poore souldiers to carry our baggage, by reason that the frost was so great, that horses were not able to passe, and the way vnusuall. From the
<HI>Brill</HI> the next day we crosst the water; and landing, we had waggons that conueyed vs and ours to the <HI>Hage:</HI> where, no sooner being alighted, but that sir <HI>Anthony</HI> (attended by vs) went to visite his Excellency, consociated with master <HI>Gilpin</HI> the Quéens Agent thither, where continuing not past an houre to complement with the Prince, he withdrew himselfe to his lodging to repose himselfe: whither (not long after) his Excellencie and the States sent fiftie great flaggons of wine, togither with his Passe through his Countrey, whereby he was to take conuoy as he thought requisite. The next day to <HI>Leiden,</HI> so to <HI>Vtricke,</HI> to <HI>Dewborough,</HI> and then to <HI>Collen,</HI> the passage wherevnto was some∣what dāgerous; by occasion wherof we had sir <HI>Nicholas Parkers</HI> troupe of horse to conuoy vs thither; our compa∣ny hauing <HI>25.</HI> of his horses to ride on, &amp; <HI>25.</HI> more of his troup, besides the cornetbearer to accompany vs to
<HI>Col∣len,</HI> which we did in <HI>6.</HI> daies, spending one night merily.</P>
<P>The next morning, sir <HI>Anthony</HI> giuing the troupe that were his conuoy a bountifull rewarde, sent them
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>backe againe; wée taking our iourney forewardes tho∣rowe those partes of
<HI>Germanie,</HI> as <HI>Frankeford, Norem∣bege,</HI> and so to <HI>Augusta,</HI> altogether by coach. From whence wee hired horses to passe the <HI>Alpes,</HI> in respect that it was not passable by coach. And from thence we were tenne dayes passing to <HI>Venice,</HI> whither we went, with resolution to aide the duke of <HI>Ferrara</HI> in his warres against the Pope; who (good duke) fearing the Popes curse, gaue ouer the warres, as the Pope would: how∣beit we remained in <HI>Venice</HI> tenne wéekes. In which time, sir <HI>Anthony</HI> went to the Duke thereof, who enter∣tained him with all princely complement, sending him to his lodging, a roy all banquet of all kinde of confected swéete meates, and wine in great aboundaunce; which continued a long time. Who likewise commaunded that we should haue libertie to sée any thing in the cittie wor∣thy the sight, which accordingly we saw, to sir
<HI>Anthonies</HI> no small cost; for in his rewards, he was there, and else∣where, most royall.</P>
<P>To write of the fashions and dispositions of the <HI>Ger∣mans</HI> and <HI>Italians,</HI> were a matter not woorth my paines, because it is so well knowne to all men, that knowes, or haue read, or heard any thing: therefore I will goe for∣ward with our iourney, and write of matter more no∣uellous, and lesse knowne to my home-bred countrey∣men, for whose sake (chiefly) I haue compiled this Dis∣course.</P>
<P>In Maie next folowing our departure from England, we set forwards from <HI>Venice,</HI> in an Italian ship, which we had compounded with, amongst others, to conuey vs to <HI>Aleppo;</HI> but by occasion of some iarres wée hadde with some Italians (passengers as wée were) in the ship, they landed vs in an Iland of the <HI>Venetians</HI> called
<HI>Zanc,</HI> vnto which place wée were two and twenty dayes pas∣sing: the captaine assuring vs, that we shoulde haue
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>passed it in tenne dayes, which made vs prouide but for aftéene dayes vittaile; those fiftéene dayes being expi∣red, our vittaile quite spent, and hauing seauen dayes trauell further in that ship, we could for money, nor by no meanes get any vittailes of those vnkinde Italians, whereby we had bin very gréeuously distressed, but that certaine Persians (though Pagans by profession) being in the ship well vittailed, and séeing the impious and dogged disposition of those Italians, supplied all our wants for that seauen dayes <HI>gratis.</HI> In which time, an Italian in that shippe, vsing some villainous and oppro∣brious speaches towardes our Queenes Maiestie, and the same not heard of by sir <HI>Anthony,</HI> nor any of his company in two dayes after, but then made knowne by an Italian that attended maister <HI>Robert Sherly:</HI> where∣of when sir <HI>Anthony</HI> heard, he forthwith caused one of our company so to heate him with a billet, that it is im∣possible he should euer recouer it. In the performaunce whereof, he made a great outcry, wherevpon all the I∣talians were vp in armes, being in number some thrée score persons, and we but foure and twenty. Howbeit, we were (with weapons drawne) prest to defend and offend. The captaine of the ship thereupon demanded of sir <HI>Anthony</HI> how any man durst intermeddle, in that kinde, vnder his commaund? Wherevnto sir <HI>Anthony</HI> replied, that it was an iniurie, tending to the reproach and indignitie of his Soueraigne, which hee neither would nor could indure; and therewithall told him, if he would subborne or abet him therein, the one side should welter in their blood. And our side being rather desirous to prosecute this point with swordes, then with wordes. Sir
<HI>Anthonies</HI> brother gaue the captaine a sound boxe, which was very hardely digested, and much mischiefe had like to haue fallen thereon; but by meanes of cer∣taine Merchants in the ship, more feareful of their goods
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>then of the losse of their bloods (and yet fearefull enough of either) pacified (with much adoe) both parties, How∣beit either part liued watching and warding vntill they put vs on shore, on the said Iland of <HI>Zant:</HI> where they left vs hopelesse (God wot) of going forwards or backe∣wards. There we continued ten dayes, in which time we hired a Gréekish ship, being an open boate, and very olde, and full of dangerous leakes; yea so dangerous were the leakes, that in eleuen daies (in which time wée passed from
<HI>Zant</HI> to <HI>Candia</HI>) continually during all that time foure men had as much toile as possibly they could indure, to laue water out of this rotten boate: which was so weake, that if euen then wee hadde hadde but euer so little rough weather, there had all our hopes, to∣gether with our carcasses, perished, and we neuer haue arriued at <HI>Candia.</HI> Where we made our abode some twelue dayes, vntill our boate was repaired, and made fitter to brooke the seas. In which time, the Gouernor of that Ile (being a Duke vnder the Venetians) sent for sir
<HI>Anthony</HI> to his Pallace to dinner, who also sent to his lodging, a very great and costly banquet, and like∣wise permitted vs (in great fauour) to passe round about the towne, to sée the strength thereof; which was reaso∣nable well fortified with ordonance and other adiuncts of warre, especially on that side that lay towards the sea: the other partes not so strong, for the ditch about the Towne was drie. The Inhabitants of that towne and Isle are (for the most part) Gréekes, whose maners and behauiors doe verifie our English prouerb, which term∣eth any man, pleasantly disposed (by reason of wine, or otherwise) a merry Gréeke; alluding to these Gréekes, that alwayes sit drinking and playing the good fellowes before their doores: some dauncing arme in arme vp and downe the towne: Some others making some other sports, to procure laughter; and thus gamesomely doe
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>they passe their time, as if they were created but for the matter of pleasure: So that to me it séemed no litle won∣der, that that Nation, which heretofore made all the world admire their wisedome and learning, who (in regarde of themselues) held all the worlde besides, but Barbarians or harbarous, should now become such cup shot companions, tripping their nimble wittes with quicke and subtile wine, thereby turning all their déepe pollicie, into déepe carowsing, and shallow iocunditie. But, <HI>Tempora mutantur, &amp; nos mutamur in illis.</HI> Hauing spent those twelue dayes, as aforesaide, in
<HI>Candia,</HI> a∣mong those merry Gréekes, we eftsoones imbarked our selues for
<HI>Ciprus,</HI> to which we were some nine dayes passing: where (as the saying is) the Italians (with whome we passed to <HI>Zant</HI>) did our errand (like knights errand) against our comming. They made reporte to the Turkes inhabiting the same Ile, that we were all pirats, and that they should do wel to lay hands on vs, &amp; to carry vs to the great Turk their emperor, because, besides that, we were pirats, &amp; came into <HI>Turky,</HI> but as spies. Wherevpon the Turkes laid handes vpon vs, e∣uen vpon our first arriuall, threatning to haue brought vs to <HI>Constantinople:</HI> howbeit they staird vs in <HI>Ciprus</HI> two daies; in which time, they were indifferently well qualified, in hope of mony we promised them, and which they had, to their full contentment, ere we parted from them.</P>
<P>This was the worst welcome which we receiued on shoare since our departure from the English shore, and made vs most to doubt our safety. But within two dayes passage of
<HI>Candia,</HI> as we came towardes <HI>Ciprus</HI> (which I had almost omitted) there is also a Gréekish Isle (whose name (I am ashamed therfore) I haue quite forgotten) wherevpon we touched and watered, which is some half mile ouer, hauing one religious house ther∣in
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>and alone, with about some twenty Gréeke friggets inhabiting the same, which is (as wée thought) an other <HI>Eden;</HI> and the most pleasant place that euer our eies behelde, for the exercise of a solitary and contem∣platiue life: for it is furnished with the foizen of all Gods good blessings. All kinde of fruites (as apples, peares, plumbes, orenges, lemmonds, pomegranates, and the like) in great aboundaunce groweth there: with most pleasant gardens, replenished with all man∣ner of odoriferous floures, and wholesome hearbes for sallets, or medicines: wherein breaketh foorth many fresh and cristall cléere Springs of water: hauing therewithall, cattell▪ (as beeues and muttons there na∣turally bred) more than sufficient to serue that house. In our trauelles many times, falling into daungers, and vnpleasant places, this onely Island would be the place where we woulde wish our selues to end our liues. They haue also this helpe, that if they did want aught, shipping continually passing by that way, would soone supply it.</P>
<P>From <HI>Ciprus</HI> (as from a place we had small reason to take pleasure in, our entertainement was so vn∣pleasaunt) wee hired a very small boate of some ten tunne (there being none other to hire) to transporte vs vnto the Holy Land, the which was but foure and twenty houres sailing. But the Turkes (our Taxers) tolde vs, that there lay Gallies fraught with Théeues that robbed all that passed that way: notwithstanding, we hoised vp saile, and put our selues to Sea thither∣ward, abandoning our selues to all the rouing aduen∣tures of Fortune, being accompanied with an other boate which helde her direct course whither we were bound, which was taken (as afterward appéered) and her men drowned. But, as God woulde haue it, (to whome, as well for that, as all our other many many
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>preseruations, beyond all probabilitie and expectation, we were infinitely bound) our boate, by the way, being taken by an indirect winde, to that our direct course, we thereby fell downe vpon <HI>Tripoly.</HI> Who being guided by an omnipotent and neuer-failing Pilote, we passed out of the sea into that famous riuer <HI>Orontes;</HI> along the which we held our course vp into the countrie, the Iani∣zaries or souldiers thereof flocking about vs, threatning, that if they might not haue what they demaunded, they would cul out such of our company as best pleased them to serue their zodomiticall appetites, and most vile and villainous purposes.</P>
<P>This while we sent to <HI>Antioch,</HI> not thrée dayes iour∣ney off, for certaine Ianizaries, to safeconduct vs thi∣ther, which Ianizaries were of our Interpreters ac∣quaintance, who being come, the other left vs immedi∣ately, and so we passed to <HI>Antioch,</HI> conducted by the Ia∣nizaries which we sent for thither, where we remained sixe or seauen dayes, for the company of certaine Mer∣chants that were bound to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> béeing six dayes ior∣ney from <HI>Antioch,</HI> betwéene which Cities, in the way, were from time to time, diuers robberies committed by some two hundred Arabs, vntill that instant that wee were at <HI>Antioch,</HI> where we heard, that the Ianizaries of <HI>Aleppo</HI> issued out against these robbers, part of whom they killed, and the rest put to flight, by meanes where∣of, our passage was cléered to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> whither we were bound, and where we were right well entertained, by the English Consulles, and the rest of the English mer∣chants. There we remayned about some sixe wéekes at the English houses, and feasted (for the most parte) while wée there continued. And being examined by the
<HI>Bashaw</HI> of that place, touching our intendement, sir <HI>Anthony</HI> aunswered, that wee were Merchants, de∣sirous to trade to the vtmost confines of his countries;
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>which was graunted by the <HI>Bashaw,</HI> with his Passe, to∣gether with the English Consulls and vice-consulls.</P>
<P>Leauing héere awhile to prosecute our iorney, I will speake somewhat of the fashion and disposition of the people and country; whose behauiours in point of ciuili∣tie (besides that they are damned Infidells, and Zodo∣miticall Mahomets) doe answer the hate we christians doe iustly holde them in. For they are beyond all mea∣sure a most insolent superbous and insulting people, euer more prest to offer outrage to any christian, if he be not well guarded with a Ianizarie, or Ianizaries. They sit at their meat (which is serued to them vpon the ground) as Tailers sit vpon their stalls, crosse-legd: for the most part, passing the day in banqueting and carowsing, vn∣till they surfet, drinking a certaine liquor which they do call <HI>Coffe,</HI> which is made of a séde much like mustard séede, which wil soone intoxicate the braine, like our Me∣theglin. They will not permitte any christian to come within their churches, for they holde their profane and irreligious Sanctuaries defiled thereby. They haue no vse of Belles, but some priest thrée times in the day, mounts the toppe of their church, and there, with an ex∣alted voyce cries out, and inuocates Mahomet to come in post, for they haue long expected his second comming. And if within this sixe yéeres (as they say) he come not (being the vtmost time of his appoyntment and pro∣mise made in that behalfe) they haue no hope of his com∣ming. But they feare (according to a prophecie they haue) the Christians at the end therof shal subdue them all, and conuert them to christianitie. They haue wiues in number according to their wealth, two, thrée, foure, or vpwards, according as they are in abilitie turnished to maintaine them. Their women are (for the most part) very faire, barbed euery where; and death it is for anie christian carnally to know them; which, were they wil∣ling
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>to doe, hardly could they attaine it, because they are closely chambred vp, vnlesse it be at such time as they go to their <HI>Bastoues,</HI> or to the Graues, to bewaile their dead (as their maner is) which once a wéeke vsually they doo, and then shall no part of them be discouered neither, but onely their eies, except it be by a great chaunce. The country aboundeth with great store of all kinds of fruit, whereupon (for the most parte) they liue, their chéefest meate being Rice. Their flesh is Mutton and Hennes; which Muttons haue huge broade fatte tailes. This meate most commonly they haue but once in the day, all the rest, they eate fruite as aforesaide. They eate very little béefe, vnlesse it be the poorest sort. Camels for their carriage they haue in great abundance; but when both them and their horses are past the best, and vnfit for car∣riage, the poorest of their people eate them.</P>
<P>They haue one thing most vsual among them, which though it be right wel knowne to all of our Nation that knowe <HI>Turkie,</HI> yet it excéedeth the credite of our home-bred countriemen, for relating whereof (perhappes) I may be held a liar, hauing authoritie so to doe (as they say and thinke) because I am a traueller. But the truth thereof (being knowne to al our Englishmen that trade or trauel into those partes) is a warrant omnisufficient for the report, how repugnant soeuer it be to the beléefe of our English multitude.</P>
<P>And this it is, when they desire to heare news, or in∣telligence out of any remote parts of their country with all celeritie (as we say, vppon the wings of the winde) they haue pigeons that are so taught and brought to the hand, that they will flie with Letters (fastened with a string about their bodies vnder their wings) containing all the intelligence of occurrents, or what else is to be ex∣pected from those partes: from whence, if they shoulde send by camells (for so otherwise they must) they should
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>not heare in a quarter of a yéere, for so long would they be in continuall trauel. As for example; when any mer∣chandize are to come out of the east
<HI>Indies,</HI> to <HI>Mecha,</HI> or else-where of like distaunce, pigeons are carried from
<HI>Mecha</HI> or <HI>Aleppo</HI> before hand, which is a quarter of a yéeres passage, then they tie (as before is mentioned) the said letters about the pigeons, acquainting therby their factors what commodities they haue, and what are like to prooue most vendible: by meanes whereof (whiles their camels are thrée noneths in comming) they know what merchandize is fit to be kept, and what to doe a∣way.</P>
<P>Now to returne where I left, and so to goe forward with our iourney: wée passed from <HI>Aleppo</HI> through the heart of the Turkes country, the strength whereof is very small, whereof the christian Princes are ignorant, (as it séems) for if they knew it, as we do, that with al cir¦cumspection obserued it; doubtlesse, they would with no great difficultie vtterly suppresse him, or so extreamely distresse him, that they would constrain him to embrace the christian faith, and rest at their deuotion, or at least remoue his seate from the holy land, and parts adiacent. And to giue the Reader a taste how probable this is, (lest I should be held, as one that knoweth not whereof he doth affirme) there is (as it is there commonly repor∣ted, and as commonly knowne) in all <HI>Palestine</HI> and <HI>Sy∣ria,</HI> but one thousand and fiue hundred Ianizaries that guardes those citties of
<HI>Aleppo, Damascus, Antioch,</HI> and <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> As for <HI>Grand-cagro,</HI> they are not able to stir for diuerse Arabs that lie in the hilles betwixt <HI>Ierusalem</HI> and it: betwéene whome and those Turkes of <HI>Grand∣cagro</HI> there is deadly feud, as the Scot speaketh.

<P>From <HI>Aleppo</HI> we set forwards in the middest of Au∣gust, accompanied with our English merchants thrée day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>uit wit, vntil we came to a Towne called
<HI>Beerah,</HI> or <HI>Birrah</HI> by which runnes the most famous riuer of <HI>Eu∣phrates,</HI> parting <HI>Mesopotamia</HI> and <HI>Syria;</HI> where wee re∣sted sixe or seauen dayes, whilest boates were preparing for vs, and other Turkish merchants: that beeing done, we parted from our merchants, and betooke our selues to the saide riuer of <HI>Euphrates,</HI> on the which we were somo thrée and twenty dayes passing downe the same. In which time we came by a castle called <HI>Racca,</HI> where we were to take in fresh meate, and men to rowe. But loe, there it happened, that a Turke being in one of the boats in our company, discharged his péece towards the shoare at randon, where he most vnhappily slew a Turk of the towne, (the bullet entring his braine:) by reason whereof, our boate, aswell as the rest, was stayed, and we constrained to make satisfaction for the mans death: which cost sir
<HI>Anthony</HI> for his company some hundred crownes. Which being payed, and wée discharged, we held on our course from thence some two or thrée dayes passage, where we were eftsoones stayed by the King of the <HI>Arrabs</HI> there liuing vpon the riuers side in Tents: before whome we were brought, whose handes we kiss: and demaunding what we were, and what businesse we had in those partes, we replied, we were Englishmen, and Merchants by our trades, comming for traffike in∣to those partes of the world. Wherevpon this good king tolde vs that he must néedes sée our merchandize, which we (God wot) durst not contradict: and so he borrowed (without a priuy Seale, or bill of his hand) some thirtie yardes of cloth of siluer, vntill our returne. That being done, we had licence to departe to our boate. In whose
<PB N="14" REF="11"/>campe we sawe nothing but a multitude of cammelles, mules, asses, horses, shéepe, and goats: from whence wee passed to another towne called
<HI>Anna.</HI></P>
<P>From thence, to a towne called <HI>Dire,</HI> by which there is a lake or poole of very pitch, which in their language they call, the mouth of Hell. It swelles in the middest thereof to the bignesse of an hogshead, and so breaketh with a great puffe, falling flat, and thus continually it worketh: whereof there is no bottome to be found, al∣beit it often hath beene tried by all meanes. There was nothing else woorth the noting, vntill we came where we were to passe by land agayne. So we sent for cam∣mels and horses to <HI>Babilon</HI> (being two daies iorny from vs) to carry vs thither. Where being no sooner come, for our welcome, we had all our merchandize arrested, for the vse of the Bashaw of that place, to be payed therefore, at his price and pleasure: howbeit we had li∣cence to prouide our selues an house, and hée dealt bet∣ter with vs then wée expected; for hée gaue vs, by esti∣mation, halfe the woorth of our goodes, which was good pay, from so ill a debter. Yet hée extorted from sir <HI>An∣thony</HI> a great deal of plate made of pure emerald, which hée purposed to bestow on the Persian king, by vs cal∣led, the <HI>Sophy.</HI> Howbeit we preuented him, for the one halfe of our goodes, which was carried into the towne in another Turkes name that came with vs, for which fauour, we gaue him (by agréement) fortie crownes. At <HI>Babilon</HI> (being thus entertained) wée remained a mo∣neth, or more, in which time a Dutchman, being one of our company, had like to haue preferred vs all to the heads-mans handling. For, being one day drunke (ac∣cording to his woont) and withall, bearing a grudge to some of our company) went in that moode to some of the chiefe Officers of the Turkes in
<HI>Babilon,</HI> made signes to them that he had some matter of importaunce
<PB N="15" REF="11"/>to deliuer to the <HI>Bashaw,</HI> touching sir <HI>Anthony.</HI> Which Officers sent for an Armenian a christian, that was then in towne, who had vsed sir
<HI>Anthony</HI> excéeding wel, and was beloued no lesse of these Officers, to whome they shewed the signes this Dutchman had made. Hée foorthwith aunswered, that he was a druncken compa∣nion, and that sir <HI>Anthony</HI> hadde often beaten him for his immoderate bowzing, and continuall drunkennesse, which was (as hée saide in our excuse) the onely cause he thus plaied his parte. And withall, desired them to suf∣fer their Ianizaries to beate him well, and to send him so beaten to his maister. Which was done (by theyr commaunde) accordingly. Wherevpon sir <HI>Anthony</HI> was constraind to chamber him vp close, vntil we were past daunger: leauing money with him to carry him backe to
<HI>Aleppo.</HI></P>
<P>During the time we staied in <HI>Babilon,</HI> we hadde all kinde of fowle, flesh, and fish, with great store of venison very cheape.</P>
<P>The olde tower of <HI>Babel</HI> is thrée dayes iourney from this place, which by common and iust reporte of the in∣habitants of this Cittie, is about the height of <HI>Paules,</HI> at this time, as they by towers of the like height, in our estimation described it. It is not hollow, but sollide tho∣rowout; the base, or foote whereof, is about a quarter of a mile in compasse. It consistes of Brickes baked in the Sunne, of great breadth and thickenesse, interlined with canes pleated like mattes, which remayne much lesse perished then the Brickes.</P>
<P>The tower which is called <HI>Nabuchadnezers</HI> To∣wer, stands hard by new <HI>Babilon,</HI> which is fashioned much like the other (as it is said) but not so high as that we sawe, by which doth runne the famous riuer <HI>Tigris,</HI> taking his course through the Citie, and so along by this tower.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="12"/> Thus, hauing spent a moneth, and somewhat more, in new Babilon, in great feare and perplexitie, by rea∣son of the druncken Dutchmans signes and tokens (as before is mentioned) staying the most of that time for a Carauan of the Persians, and a great company of Merchants, wée receiued Letters from Aleppo, by which wée were wisht to make all possible spéede from Babilon, for that wée were discouered there; signify∣ing thus much further vnto vs, that there were letters from thence in all post addressed to stay vs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Carauan is a great many of Camels laden and men in a company, not much vnlike our Car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iers (many in a company) heere in Eng∣land.</NOTE> By chance this Carauan of Persians were gone but one day be∣fore we receiued these Letters, and had they bin gone foure dayes before, wée would soone haue ouertaken them, in regard of their heauy lading. But after the receipt of these Letters, it was but like the spurring of the most frée horse to hasten vs after them, for without taking leaue, we stole slily away, and were soone with them: who would not goe the direct way whither wée were bound, but passed through the <HI>Medes</HI> countrey, which was fiue or sixe dayes iourney out of the way on pilgrimage, vnto a certaine Sanctorie, a prophet of theirs; whome we were mooued to accompany, more for feare, than for any deuotion. In which country, as wée passed, we saw (that which was ruth to sée) the con∣fused ruines of maruelous great townes, which had (as it should séeme) flourished when the <HI>Medes</HI> triumphed, and their commonwealth prospered. This pilgrimage ended, we went on from thence directly the course wée had determined: demanding of the Persians, whether we had any more of the Turkish Gouernours to passe, who answered, they had one (&amp; that very mighty) called <HI>Cobat-bag,</HI> by whome we must of necessity passe. At which answer it had bin an easie matter to haue found a company of poore hearts néere their maisters mouthes; for to vs remained no hope, but that we shuld haue bin
<PB N="17" REF="12"/>inter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ted there. Yet, as God, and good for tune would, som of them (better bethinking themselues) remembred another way, through one <HI>Heyder-bags</HI> country; who was neighbor to the other, howbeit at continual wars with him, in regard wherof we had good hope he would ayde vs. So entring the first night into this <HI>Hey∣der-bags</HI> countrey or iurisdiction, the other hearing thereof; sent vnto our company, that if we would not returne and come by him, hée woulde in the morning with his troupes cutte vs into gobbets. Then were wée in woorse plight than at any time before: notwith∣standing wée resoluing to sel our blouds as déere as wée coulde (since auoyde that extreamitie wée coulde not) wée there vppon sooke heart of grace, and about mid∣night wée arose with bag and baggage, and so held on our course through <HI>Heyder-bags</HI> country. When in the breake of the day wée might descry a troupe of horses comming towardes vs, which wée verily imagined to be the ennemy: but wée were luckily deceiued, for it was he that gouerned that Countrey, who came to our succours, and safely to conuoy vs through the same, hauing hadde some intelligence before of our progresse that way.</P>
<P>Which hauing passed in safetie, through his gentle assistance and conduction, wée were indifferent well at hearts ease; albeit we had sixe dayes iourney to passe (ere we should enter the confines of <HI>Persia</HI>) through the <HI>Courdes</HI> country, which is by interpretation the shéeus country. The people whereof are altogether addicted to théeuing, not much vnlike the wilde Irish, so that as we passed through them, euery night wée didde encampe, they slily stale more or lesse from vs, watcht we neuer so warily: else woulde they doe but little hurte. This people doe liue altogether in Tents, kéeping of Cat∣tell.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="13"/> Hauing passed this pilfering people, we then happi∣ly entred the king of
<HI>Persiaes</HI> country, where vpon our first entrance we thought we had bin imparadized, fin∣ding our entertainement to be so good, and the maner of the people to be so kinde and curteous (farre differing from the Turkes) especially when they heard we came of purpose to their king. We passed from the bordures nine daies iourney, ere wée came to
<HI>Casbin,</HI> where wée expected the residence of the king: during all which time we passed by no great Townes woorth the noting, vntil we came thither, hauing sent a Currier before, to signi∣fie what wée were, to the Gouernor of the Citty, lest, by our sodayne approch, our welcome should haue bin the lesse, and his maruell the more. Who therevpon pre∣pared for vs, a house of the kings, furnisht with such or∣naments as befitted a great State. We came into the cittie by night, for that we would not be first séene in our trauelling apparrell. Howbeit the Gouernour the next morning, together with the chiefe of the kings house, came with a great traine, to salute sir <HI>Anthony,</HI> assu∣ring him that his comming would be right pleasing and acceptable to the king: but signified vnto him, that hée then was, in person, against the Tartares, his bordu∣rers, with whome hée had warres) to whome, at that time, he had, in a pitched field, giuen a mightie ouer∣throwe. And therevpon dismist a poste to the king, sig∣nifying vnto him, that there was come, a christian (right well attended) to sée him, by reason of the great fame he had heard of him. Which when by the poste he vnder∣stoode, hée made as much expedition as possibly hée could (with respect had to his great affaires) to come to sir
<HI>Anthony.</HI> There we remained some thrée wéeks be∣fore he came.</P>
<P>In which time we were banquetted, and right roy∣ally intreated, by the Gouernour and the kings Ste∣ward,
<PB N="19" REF="13"/>who brought vs to the kings gate, to offer that homage that all strangers doe, that is, to kisse the en∣trance of his Pallace thrée times. Against the kings comming, wée apparrelled our selues in the best maner we could, with such stuffe as we brought with vs, that is to say, sir <HI>Anthony</HI> himselfe in cloth of golde, the vp∣per coate and vnder. His brother, in cloth of siluer, the vpper and vnder. Sixe Gentlemen, their lower coates silke, the vpper, cloth of siluer. Foure of his chiefest ser∣uants, in silke vnder-coates, the vpper, crimsin veluet. The rest of his seruants, in a prettie kinde of bombaste stuffe, all the vpper coats, watchet damaske; our whole number being six and twenty, which made a very seem∣ly shew, the fashion of our apparrell somwhat differing from the Persian.</P>
<P>Now by this time that we were thorowly thus fur∣nished and fitted, the king approched within fiue miles where he incamped: from whence he sent to his Gouer∣nour, commaunding him to furnish our company the next day with horses, to the end we might come foorth to méete him on the way, which was performed an ei∣ther part accordingly. He comming in great triumph, hauing borne before him, aduaunced vpon pikes, one thousand and two hundred heads of the conquered
<HI>Tar¦tares;</HI> whose king, and his sonne, hée led along in tri∣umph, hauing taken them prisoners: which triumph was continually more and more graced and augmen∣ted, by the country as hée passed, each one indeuouring (according to his power) to giue him welcome from the warres. Himselfe being accompanied with all his no∣bles and great men in diuerse troupes, that wee could not sée any thing all the way, but men and horses, with such thundering of trumpets, kettle drummes (carried vpon camells) and such like instruments of warre, that a man woulde haue thought, heauen and earth were
<PB N="20" REF="14"/>tilting together. Their trumpets being all straight, som two yards and an halfe in length, hauing such a déepe, harsh, and horrible voyce, that it would amaze a man to heare them, if he neuer heard them before. At length we were brought into the presence of the King, as hée thus passed in triumph: wee all dismounting our horses to kisse his foote (as the maner is) sir <HI>Anthony</HI> first, who offering to performe that complement, the king, out of speciall and vnusuall fauour, put his hand betweene his mouth and his foote, and would not permit him to doe it, so all the rest in order kissed his foote: which béeing done, the king called sir <HI>Anthony</HI> vnto him, tolde him that hee was right heartily welcome to him, and to his country, which ere his departure he saide he should find indéede. Who suffering not sir <HI>Anthony</HI> to reply, cau∣sed his horse to be brought, and so we rode on next to the king. Where, in a while after, we might sée a great troupe of curtezans of the citie come riding richly appa∣relled, to salute the king, and to welcome him from his warres. Their apparel little differing in fashion from the mens, but only in their head attire and vpper coats. They weare bréeches, and ride astride as men do, and came with such a crie as the wilde Irish make. The multitude of people were so great (consisting of Actors and Spectators) that we has much adoe in sixe houres to passe thrée miles, which was from the place where we met the king, to the market place of the Cittie. Vn∣to which at length being come, the king brought vs to the doore of the house where we should alight, scituate in the same, commaunding one of his great men to place vs therein, whilst himselfe rid about some houre or two to sée the shewes and matters of triumph perfourmed. Which being done, he returned to sir <HI>Anthony,</HI> where being set vpon the ground, with carpets vnder him, ac∣cording to the custome of the countrey, commaunding
<PB N="21" REF="14"/>stooles to be brought for sir <HI>Anthony</HI> and his brother: there sir
<HI>Anthony</HI> made his Oration: which being en∣des, the king discoursed with him of his trauelles, of his natiue countrey, the manner of gouernement there, and of diuerse other things that accidentally became then subiect to their discourse: the particularities whereof sir
<HI>Anthony</HI> answered, to the kings high contentment: and further, possest the king with such a burning desire to inuade the Turks dominions (by reason his strength was so small, as before is mentioned, and then at large sir <HI>Anthony</HI> vnfolded) that he would on the very necke of that his late victorie, before his blood was colde (as it were) haue entred into action against the Turke, to the which sir <HI>Anthony</HI> ceased not to animate him, for a double grudge hée bare him, to witte, for being such a mortall ennemy to Christ, and for vsing them so like mortall ennemies, being christians: howbeit, that ex∣pedition was, for a time, deferred, yet neuerthelesse fully resolued on. These, and the like, made the King instantly to conceiue so excéeding well, and grew more and more into such liking of sir <HI>Anthony,</HI> that once a day at the least, he would send for him to conferre, and complement with him: yea sometimes hée must be sent for to come to his bed-chamber at midnight (accompa∣nied with his brother) for that purpose.</P>
<P>The king continued in that towne about some thirty dayes, where many nights the people entertained him with spectacles and shewes in their Basars, which we doe call shoppes, all couered ouer head, as the Royall Exchange. At which alwayes we must méete the king. Their manner is to make the greatest shew of those wares they haue, in foure long stréetes, in the mid∣dest whereof is a round kinde of stage, couered with costly carpets, whereon is layde all kinde of fruites, confections, and wine for the king to banquet withall.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="15"/> After that he hath séene all the shewes, towardes night, they set vp as many lights as possible can stand one by another, consisting all of lamps; so that, by esti∣mation, there burneth at once in those foure stréetes a hundred thousand lamps, so close vpon, and round about their stalls vpon the ground, that a man can hardly put his hand betwéene each lampe. After which sights, he goeth to that place appointed for the banquet, where banqueting till midnight, béeing solaced all the while with all kinds of musicke, of Instruments, and voice, with boyes and Curtezans, dauncing strange kinds of Iigges and Lauoltaes: without which Curtezans, no banquet, be it neuer so costly hath any rellish with them. Howbeit no mans wife comes thereat; neither is it pos∣sible (or if it be, very rarely) for a man once to sée a wo∣man if shée be once married, and her husband liuing, no, though it be her owne naturall brother. So iclous are husbands of their wiues loues and chastities, and such cause of suspition is there amongst them in that respect. There is a custome in that country, that if the King pur∣pose to make any man great, by enoblizing him, he hath a very rich chaire sette with stones carried after him, wherein he placeth that man at his banquet in publike assembly. This chaire was brought for sir <HI>Anthony</HI> to sit in, and he by the King placed therein accordingly. Which made the people much to admire that accident, in that hee vouchsafed that high fauour to a stranger, without desert, or experience of his wórth: whereas ac∣customably he would haue great proofe of a mans wor∣thinesse, before he would so vouchsafe to dignifie him. Instantly as he caused sir <HI>Anthony</HI> to sit, he gaue him his owne girdle from about him for a further fauour: which was all of some golden stuffe, very curious and costly, thrée yards long, and an ell broade.</P>
<P>Thrée dayes after he sent a Present to sir <HI>Anthony</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="15"/>béeing a certaine demonstration of the great estimation he hadde him in. Which was, fortie horses furnished with saddles &amp;c. foure of which were very rich and faire, fit for the proper vse of any Prince, twelue camels for carriage, together with fix mules, foure and twenty car∣pets, most of them rich and faire, thrée Tents or Pauili∣ons, with all other necessaries of house; last of al, six men laden with siluer. The steward that brought it, tolde sir <HI>Anthony</HI> that the King had sent him that, to defray his charges till the next remoue, which was ten dayes off. I néede not speake more of the Kings bountie, let the world, by this, imagin the rest, and how he entreated Sir
<HI>Anthony.</HI></P>
<P>And albeit the fashion and mauer of the Persians is not vnknowne to many of our English nation, as ha∣uing, by their owne trauells, attained that knowledge: or by reading, or credible report bin informed thereof: Yet somewhat to speake touching the same, I hold it not altogether amisse, for the better information of those (my countrymen) that doe not so well know it. For their sitting at meate on the ground, with their manner of foode and féeding, it is much after the Turkish guise. Their deuotion as the Turkes, but somwhat different in religion. As the Persian praieth only to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and <HI>Mortus Ally,</HI> the Turke to those two, and to three other that were <HI>Mahomets</HI> seruants. Against which three, the Persian stil inueighs, and hath in al townes, men that carry axes on their shoulders, challenging them to rise againe, and they are there prest to incoun∣ter them by force of armes.</P>
<P>They vse much exercise, as hawking and hunting, with very much shooting. Their hawkes are excellent good, which they beare on their right hand, without hood or bell.</P>
<P>The merchandize and commodities which <HI>Persia</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="16"/>yéeldeth, are silkes, both rawe, and otherwise, of all sutes and colours. Spices, drugges, pearles, and other pretious Iems: together with carpets of diuers kinds. These, with many other commodities of this nature, <HI>Persia</HI> plentifully affoordeth.</P>
<P>They write from the right side of the paper to the left like the Turkes, contrary to our manner. Their Let∣ters or Characters being so irregular, and (as we would thinke) deformed, that to vs it séemeth the writing of some vtterly vnskilfull in letters or learning, or as a wilde kind of scribling, that hath therein neither forme nor matter: howbeit they affirm their writing is most compendious, and euery letter (well néere) with his circumfler importeth a whole word, though consisting of many sillables.</P>
<P>They haue not many Bookes, much lesse great Li∣braries amongst their best Clarkes. They are no lear∣ned nation, but ignorant in all kinde of liberall or lear∣ned Sciences, and almost of all other Arts and Facul∣ties, except it be in certaine things pertaining to hor∣ses furniture, and some kindes of carpettings and silke workes, wherein they excell.</P>
<P>They haue neither golde nor siluer from any mines of their owne, for they haue none: howbeit they haue money made of both kindes, in great plenty, together with some small coyne made of copper, like our <HI>Bristow</HI> tokens.</P>
<P>Theyr conceit of Christ is, that hée was a very great Prophet, and a most holy and religious man, but no way comparable to <HI>Mahomet:</HI> for <HI>Mahomet</HI> (say they) was that finall prophet, by whom all things were, and are to be perfected and consummated. They further say, that because God had neuer wife, therefore Christ can∣not possibly be his sonne.</P>
<P>If any man conspire treason against the king, or o∣therwise
<PB N="25" REF="16"/>capitally offend him, hée is punished, not onely in his owne person, but in his whole Tribe.</P>
<P>If they affirme any matter with an othe, they swear by God and <HI>Mahomet,</HI> or <HI>Mortus Ally:</HI> and when they would be beléeued, they sweare by all thrée at once.</P>
<P>They circumcise their children at seauen yéeres olde, according to the custome of their neighbour the Turks.</P>
<P>In making water, the men kowre downe like the women, and when they doe it, they haue a spowte or springer, to spirt some parte of their water vppon their priuy partes, aswell men as women, which they holde as a kinde of religious duty, and which in no sort must be neglected.</P>
<P>They buy and sell men and women in the market, which is a principal merchandise of theirs among them selues. If they buy any yoong women there, they féele them euery where. If a man buy a bond-woman for his owne carnalitie, and she prooue false to him, hée may (by their lawe) kill her, as he may a dog in Eng∣land.</P>
<P>In praying, they turne their faces towardes the South, as wee doe towardes the East, because
<HI>Mecha</HI> where <HI>Mahomet</HI> is encoffined in yron (which by force of a Temples roofe, consisting of Adamant, hangeth, as it were, by way of myracle in the ayre) lieth in
<HI>Arabia,</HI> which is South from them. To which, whosoeuer shall go on pilgrimage (as many of them doe) they are euer held for most holy and sacred Saintes, which they call
<HI>Setes,</HI> and not onely themselues are so reputed, but the posteritie of that man are so accounted, and of them∣selues are so perswaded. For if one shall in any thing contradict them, either in saying or in dooing, they will ouer-rule him, and exact credit and beléefe with all obe∣dience, by saying he is a Saint at least, and therefore, on paine of damnation, must be beléeued, and highly e∣stéemed
<PB N="26" REF="17"/>although hée lie neuer so loudely, and do neuer so lewdly.</P>
<P>Their buildings are (for the most parte) made of bricke, hardned in the sand, not made with fire, as durs are: wherein they haue very little furniture other then carpets vpon their floores; and such the poorest man hath, but the goodnes thereof is according to the abilitie of the owners: their houses are all made with flatte roofes without, couered with a kinde of plaister, or earth spred plaisterwise.</P>
<P>Néere vnto a towne called <HI>Backo</HI> in <HI>Persia,</HI> there issueth out of the earth in the manner of a water-spring, a certaine kind of oyle, in great abundance, which they (from all parts of the Persian dominions) do fetch vpon Camels, Kine, and Asses, to burne in lamps, which are the lights they vse in their houses.</P>
<P>The people are now very curteous, vsing all stran∣gers with great kindnesse and ciuilitie, especially since this King hath gouerned. Howbeit (by report) they haue béene heretofore little better (in that respect) then the Turks.</P>
<P>The names of the parts of <HI>Persia,</HI> that in times past were distinct kingdomes, are
<HI>Casuin, Hasphane, Seraze, Knghgollo, Suster, Curdistan, Hammadan, Kirman,</HI> vp∣on
<HI>Corrozan.</HI> These this King had when he came first to the crowne; these following he tooke and wan since. <HI>Tuntabas, Coffe, Corrazon, Buchora, Vrgans, Taskane, Strabat,</HI> the kingdoms of <HI>Mascendran, Marcu, Rusten∣dar, Nure-cugge.</HI> The kingdomes of
<HI>Ieglands;</HI> the first <HI>Iegland, Reast, Saughtoser, Caskeger, Tawlis, Aderbeg∣san,</HI> béeing a great kingdome.</P>
<P>These townes following were lost by his Predecessors to the Turke. <HI>viz. Tawris, Seruan, Samachy, Iange, Berthe,</HI> with many others; which the Persian doth now hope to recouer; béeing farre better able then in times
<PB N="27" REF="17"/>past, for that he hath drawne all the fore-mentioned townes and parts into his possession: which, when his Predecessors would inuade the Turke before, these would impeach and mollest them behinde: so that now he stands secure from all inuasion of the borderers, whereby he is able to carry all his force cléere, without interruption against the Turke, which at the least will be foure hundred thousand strong. Vpon which vnder∣taking he is (as before was mentioned) fully resolued: but first by sir
<HI>Anthonies</HI> aduice, he is determined to ioyne in league, amitie, and confederacie with the Christian princes, by meanes whereof, he may the soo∣ner preuaile in his purpose, and thereby vtterly sup∣presse the Turke. Howbeit his councellers were all ob∣stinately bent against these determinations and pro∣céedings at the first, yet the king with his generall, who is a <HI>Georgian</HI> Christian (still animated and prouoked therevnto by sir
<HI>Anthonies</HI> forcible perswasions) were resolute and confident in the cause, and béeing so irre∣mouable, at last preuailed, and all the rest absolutely as∣sented. And by that mutuall consent of the king and his counsell, no man was thought so sit to be imployed in Embassie to the christian princes (to the purpose aboue recited) as sir <HI>Anthony</HI> béeing a Christian, and the first mouer of the king to these vndertakings, appointing a great man of the Persians to accompany him in those businesses, but the whole burden thereof to lie onely vp∣on sir <HI>Anthony,</HI> who vndertooke the same accordingly∣ly.</P>
<P>Which béeing concluded, and thus vndertaken, wée were ready to departe from the Kings court, lying then at <HI>Hasphane,</HI> when suddainly there came newes of a Portingall fryer, that was comming thither, ac∣companied with two other fryers, and foure seruants: this fryer stayed some thrée miles off the towne, and
<PB N="28" REF="18"/>sent the other two with letters to sir <HI>Anthony;</HI> whereby he signified vnto him that he was the last King of Por∣tingales brother, and that hee was sent by the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> as Procurator generall of al the East Indies. Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> beléeuing it, went himselfe, accompanied with as many christians as he could get, to the Frigot. And after mutuall gréetings, hée tolde sir <HI>Anthony,</HI> that hearing of his great and weighty businesses, and so godly a worke (he being a great bishoppe of the king of <HI>Spaines</HI>) came posting night and day to assist him there∣in. Which sir <HI>Anthony</HI> was right glad of, and to ma∣nifest the same the better, hée brought him along to his owne house, and there dislodged his brother to lodge him.</P>
<P>This being doone, hée tolde sir <HI>Anthony,</HI> that hée greatly desired to sée the King, for that hée had a present to bestow on him, which sir
<HI>Anthony</HI> soone procured. But now, by the way, this present was deliuered him in trust, to be deliuered to the king, howbeit hée presen∣ted it in his owne name, in requitall whereof the King gaue him a Crucifixe woorth (by estimation) a hundred pounds and better: which villany, and many others, sir <HI>Anthony</HI> afterwards discouered, though the meane while he held him for a holy man.</P>
<P>Ere we departed from the King, he would faine (by the Kings Commission) haue bin an Agent in the pre∣sent action, wherein sir <HI>Anthony</HI> was principally em∣ployed, and likely he was to haue bin one, with vni∣uersall consent, but that the writings &amp; all other things therevnto incident were before perfected and finished. And séeing he could be no actor (as hée defired) by reason thereof, hee intreated sir <HI>Anthony</HI> to procure the Kings fauourable letters, in his behalfe, to the Pope, and the King of <HI>Spaine;</HI> which sir
<HI>Anthony</HI> did accordingly. In requitall whereof, he beganne (vnder-hand) to deale
<PB N="29" REF="18"/>with those of the Kings councell, which had bin backe∣wards in the beginning of these businesses, who assured them, that sir <HI>Anthony</HI> was not able to performe so great a negotiation. Which sir <HI>Anthony</HI> perceiuing, hée made all the haste he possibly could to be gone, the rather, because hée had waded somewhat too farre with this execrable frier, who the first night he lodged in sir <HI>Anthonies</HI> house, found the meanes to haue a Persian curtezan to lie with him, and so had night by night du∣ring his continuannce there; which if he wanted, hée would hyre a boy zodomitically to vse. And that he was a zodomiticall wretch, it dooth appeare hereby: sir <HI>An∣thony</HI> at his first comming, bought twoo christian boies in the market, which afterwardes he bestowed on this Frier, whose name was <HI>Nicolao deMelo.</HI> He no sooner had them, but hée was in hand with them concerning his zodomiticall villany. The boyes finding whereto hée was inclined (beeing incessauntly importuned by him, to yéelde to his beastly desire, complained to him that solde them, hée likewise to the Officer, the Offi∣cer to the King, by meanes whereof the King espied his villany. Whereuppon the king sent for the boyes from him, and sent him worde, that were it not for sir <HI>Anthonies</HI> sake, he should loose his head.</P>
<P>Soone after wée departed, taking the Frier and one of his fellowes with vs, hauing eightéene dayes iour∣ney from the Persian Court to <HI>Iegland,</HI> where wée were imbarked to crosse the Caspian sea. In which time, the frier confessed hée was but an ordinary Augu∣stine frier, and in a gamesome vaine hée further con∣fessed how he woulde bring mennes wiues, after hée had shriuen them, to his bent, as taking aduantage of their confessed faultes: and to close vppe this, and such like good talke in the day, wée shoulde be sure to
<PB N="30" REF="19"/>take him with a whoore at night. And I will tell you a ieast concerning him, which I hadde almost forgot∣ten.</P>
<P>One day, at <HI>Casbin</HI> hée sent his man to a whoore, fée∣ing her with two Chickins, (which is two rialles) to come vnto him at night, taking vppon him the name of the Embassador. The kinde wench being true of promise, came vnto sir <HI>Anthony,</HI> who demaunding the cause of her comming, shee tolde him all, &amp;c. So the wench went away
<HI>gratis</HI> with the money, the frier not daring to demaund it.</P>
<P>Thus hauing merrily passed the time with this sory Frier, and being come to the place where we shoulde be imbarked, wée stayed there one moneth for the Persian Péere, that was to goe along with vs, as be∣fore is mentioned.</P>
<P>Vpon whose comming, wée presently imbarked our selues for <HI>Haster-caune,</HI> which is the first landing place of the Emperour of <HI>Rusciaes</HI> countrey to
<HI>Persia</HI> ward.</P>
<P>Vpon the <HI>Caspian</HI> sea (which wée were to crosse) wée were two moneths before wée landed: which time wée indured with much paine, and no lesse feare, hauing (besides the naturall roughnesse of the sea) very much foule and stormy weather: by reason whereof wée had béene like to haue suffered shippewracke, which twice strooke on ground, so that wée were constrained to disburden the same of a great parte of our substaunce. Howbeit in the end God so blessed vs, that in two mo∣neths wee came to our wished harborow. Where be∣ing arriued, the Gouernor hauing intelligence of our landing, sent a Captayne with a guarde to receiue vs, and to conduct vs to the castle of
<HI>Haster-caune,</HI> where was landed but the day before, an Embassadour that the King of
<HI>Persia</HI> had sent a moneth before, onely to
<PB N="31" REF="19"/>make our passage through the Emperour of <HI>Ruscia</HI> his countrey.</P>
<P>From which castle to <HI>Musco</HI> towne we were, by ri∣uer, and by land, tenne wéekes passing. All which time sir <HI>Anthony</HI> and his company, with the other Em∣bassadors, and their attendants, were all at the charge of the <HI>Ruscian</HI> Emperour (for so is the custome of that Country, to all Trauellers of that nature, as long as they are passing through his dominions) who eates such meate as is brought before them
<HI>gratis,</HI> hauing withall, a guarde set ouer them, so that they are little better then prisoners, as long as they are within the limites of his territories.</P>
<P>From <HI>Haster-caune</HI> we pasit by bote along the migh∣ty Riuer of <HI>Volgo,</HI> vntill we canie to a towne named <HI>Negson,</HI> which was seauen weekes passage. In which time, wée sawe nothing woorthy the noting, but thrée or foure woodden Eastles or Blocke-houses to guarde that Riuer, which Riuer dooth bring maruellous great commodities to the Emperour, and to the whole coun∣trey.</P>
<P>Diuerse <HI>Tartars</HI> passing from place to place about that Riuer, liuing in little houses made vpon whéeles, and are carried too and fro, hauing aboundaunce of cat∣tell, liue so in subiection to the Emperor, paying him tribute, &amp;c.</P>
<P>One onely faire Cittie we saw all that while called <HI>Gassane,</HI> wherein wee were: from whence wée passed to <HI>Negson</HI> a or sayd, where, by the way, fel out a tarre betwéene sir <HI>Anthony</HI> and the other Embassador, be∣cause sir
<HI>Anthony</HI> presumed to reprehend him for di∣uers misdemeanors which hée committed, to the disho∣nor of his king and countrey: Insomuch, that had wée not had guarde in our company, one of vs had killed
<PB N="32" REF="20"/>another. Leauing héere a while, I will turne agayne to the Frier, who was by this time growne into mortall hatred wyth hys fellow Frier, of whome before I spake, whose name was <HI>Alfonso,</HI> a Frier of the order of Saint <HI>Francis.</HI> Which Frier had acquainted sir <HI>An∣thony,</HI> that Frier <HI>Nicolao</HI> had spent his life most lewd∣ly in the <HI>Indiaes,</HI> the particularities whereof hée at large related.</P>
<P>Morcouer, hée tolde hym, that by reason of his li∣centious life, the king of
<HI>Spaine</HI> had sent for hym, be∣cause hée did much more hurte than good in those parts, but neuer would come vntill nowe that hée was going thitherward.</P>
<P>He also tolde sir <HI>Anthony,</HI> that that present which hée deliuered the king of <HI>Persia</HI> in his owne name, was sent by a friend of the kings from <HI>Ormous,</HI> by another, who had withal, a letter to the king. Which bearer, (béeing of his acquaintance) hée inueigled and inticed, by the gift of fifty Crownes, and sayre wordes, to de∣liuer hym the present, together with the Letter to carry to the king, who finally preuayled wyth hym. And when hée came to <HI>Persia,</HI> hée suppressed the letter, but delyuered the present in his owne name, as béefore is declared.</P>
<P>Vppon discouery of which villanies, sir <HI>Anthony</HI> tooke hym prisoner, and earried him along wyth hym, as one depriued of former liberty.</P>
<P>And being come to <HI>Negson,</HI> we stayed there neare hand a moneth. Towardes the end whereof the Em∣perour sent a great man of his Court thither, for to accompany and conduct vs to
<HI>Musco,</HI> who gaue the preheminence to the Persian Embassador, in that hée was Embassadour to the Emperour from the Persian, and sir <HI>Anthony</HI> but a passenger through his countrey,
<PB N="33" REF="20"/>as hée estéemed hym, and so did vse at his pleasure, to fir <HI>Anthonies</HI> small contentment, vntill we came to <HI>Musco,</HI> where wée were entertayned in the best forte they could, wyth a crue of <HI>aqua vitae</HI>-bellyed fellowes, clad in coates of cloth of gold: which shew being ended, for the first encounter those coates were put vp agayne into the Treasury or Wardrobe, and wée shut vp in prison for tenne dayes, yea all accesse of others to vs, or we to them was thereby vtterly harred. In which time wée sent to entreate, that eyther our English merchants might be permitted to come toovs, or that wée might goe or send to them for necessaries, because we were not fitted wyth clothes, (as we thought) con∣uenient for the Emperors presence.</P>
<P>Where vpon the Lord Chauncellor sent for the mer∣chants, enquyring of them what sir
<HI>Anthony</HI> was, and whether they durst giue hym any credite. To whome they replyed, that hée was nobly descended, and alied euen to the best men of <HI>England:</HI> yea, and that they woulde giue hym credite for as much as they were woorth.</P>
<P>Here vppon they had liberty to send vs such necessa∣ries as wée sent for, but no liberty to come to vs, much lesse we to them.</P>
<P>The tenth day wée were sent for to come before the Emperor after theyr order, which was, to lay downe in a note, howe euery man shoulde bee marshalled in comming (béeing all on horsebacke) wherein the Persian Embassadour was appoynted by the Empe∣rour to haue the first and chiefe place, the next, that Persian that was sent but to accompany sir
<HI>Anthony,</HI> and the last of the thrée shoulde be sir <HI>Anthony</HI> hym∣sefie.</P>
<P>Which when sir <HI>Anthony</HI> perceyued, hée vtterly
<PB N="34" REF="21"/>refused to goe in that order, because that he, to whose trust and charge the whole businesse had béene cemmit∣ted, and by whome the same was solely procured: by which <HI>Persia</HI> likewise shoulde be infinitely benefited (specially he being a christian, and they Pagans) should be put hindermost in the march, that was the formost in the matter.</P>
<P>By the meanes of which refusall, hée purchased the Emperours displeasure: and to manifest the same, first hée tooke the Frier from sir <HI>Anthony,</HI> and gaue him his libertie to goe whither hée thought good. Next, hée daily sent his great Dukes to examine sir <HI>Anthony</HI> vp∣on diuers friuolous particularities, to prooue, if they thereby might groape out some matter of aduantage a∣gainst him.</P>
<P>Thus daily hée was extreamely vexed and molested by the Emperour, the Persian Embassadour, withall, setting on the Frier vnder-hand, to deuise all the villa∣ny hée could against him, as to say, hée knew sir <HI>An∣thony</HI> to be but a man of meane parentage, and also, that hee was come but as a Spic through the Countrey for purposes tending to his owne good, and not of <HI>Per∣sia</HI> and Christendome, as hée pretended. Whereup∣on they tooke all the kings Letters from him, and ope∣ned them, to know the purport thereof.</P>
<P>Soone after sir <HI>Anthony</HI> and the Frier were brought before the Commissioners to be further examined: where sir <HI>Anthony</HI> (béeing inflamed with choler, by reason of his excéeding ill vsage, notwithstanding the goodnesse of the cause of his comming) demaunded whether the Emperour did euer purpose to send any Embassadours to any other Countries? Protesting, that if euer hée mette with them in any partes of the world, besides theyr owne, hée would indeuour to let
<PB N="35" REF="21"/>them knowe hée was not halfe so well intreated in <HI>Ruscia,</HI> as the cause of his comming of right deserued, and the Emperour, by the lawes diuine and ciuil ought to haue perfourmed, and the rather, because hée was a Christian, such as hée pretends himselfe to be, and came (as became a christian) for the generall good of al Christendome, the Persian being stirred vp therevnto by his onely meanes. Wherevpon the Frier in terms thwarted sir <HI>Anthony,</HI> whose blood already boyled, with the excesse of his chollers heate, which as then a∣bounded. And being by that gracelesse and vngratefull Frier further prouoked, hee (not able, though instant∣ly he should haue died for it) to suppresse his heate, gaue the fatte Frier such a sound box on the face (his double cause of choller redoubling his might, desire of reuenge withall augmenting the same) that downe falles the Frier, as if hée had béene strooke with a thunder-bolt. Which béeing doone, (with that courage and high re∣solution which well appéered in his lookes, wordes, and déedes) they foorthwith gaue ouer examination, be∣cause they had too far examined sir <HI>Anthonies</HI> patience, which well they with feare (as I thinke) sawe, and the Frier (almost past feare) did farre better féele. Where∣vpon they went instantly to the Emperour, and infor∣med him of all that had happened, and howe sir
<HI>An∣thony</HI> was resolued. For which (as by the euent it ap∣péered) hée was vsed the better. For from thence for∣ward we had liberty to go to the Englishmen, of whom we were very honorably entertained, and royally fea∣sted. Howbeit wée were constrained to remaine there sixe moneths, expecting euery day (for all this) some mischiefe to be doone vnto vs, or to be sent into some parte of his country to be kept, where wée shoulde not haue heard from our friendes in haste, which we feared
<PB N="36" REF="22"/>worse then death. Yet, in the end, wée were eftsoones sent for before the priuy councell, where sir <HI>Anthony</HI> had his charge to be gone, which was no small ioy to vs all.</P>
<P>But the day before wée left <HI>Muscouia,</HI> it was my fortune to sée the King, and his Quéene, in cerimonious and triumphant manner passing out of the Citty, with a great Image, and a huge Bell, to offer to a certayne Friery some thirty miles off, which was performed in this sorte. First, all the morning diuers troupes of horse passed out of the Citty, to stand ready to receiue him at his comming out of the gate. About midday the King setting forwards, his guard formost, all on horse∣backe, to the number of fiue hundred, all clad in stam∣mel coats, riding in ranke, thrée and three, with bows, and arrowes, and swords girt to them, as also hatchets vnder the one thigh. After the guarde were ledde, by twenty men, twenty goodly horses, with very rich and curious saddles, and ten more for his sonne and heire apparant, béeing a childe of twelue yeeres of age. After which was ledde, in like sorte, twenty beutifull white horses, for the Quéenes chariots, hauing onely vppon them a fine sheete, and on theyr heades a crimesin vel∣uet bridle. After them came a great number of Friers in theyr rich coapes, singing, carrying many pictures and lights. After them followed the greatest parte of the merchants of the Citty. Next them was ledde the Kings horse, for that day, together with his sonnes: the kings saddle and furniture most richly besette with stones of great price and beauty. Then followed the Patriarch, wyth all the Archbishoppes, Bishoppes, and great Prelates singing in their coapes, very rich and glorious, hauing huge Images borne before them, bée∣ing very richly inlayed, with pretious Iems of diuerse
<PB N="37" REF="22"/>colours, and lights about them. Then followed the king himselfe, who had in his left hand his sonne aboue mentioned, and in his right hand his cappe. Next him came the Quéene, supported on eyther side by two olde Ladies, hir face euen thickely plaistered with painting, as were the other Ladies (according to the custome of the Countrey) hir body very grosse, hir eyes hollowe and far into hir head, attended with some thrée score very fayre women (if painting (which they holde a mat∣ter religious) deceiued not the iudgement of mine eie.) All whose apparel was very rich, beset with pearle cu∣riously wrought, hauing white hattes on theyr heads, wyth great round bands laden wyth pearle. We ne∣uer sawe hattes worne by any women in the Country, but by them onely. Next vnto them was drawne thrée huge chariots, the first with tenne fayre white horses, two and two, the second with eight, and the third with sixe in like order: which chariots were al very rich and gorgeous within and without. After which, all the no∣ble men passed in coaches. Then was caried, in a great chest, the forenamed Image, guarded by a great man and State of the Country, with some fiue hundred vn∣der his commaund, for the guarde and conuoy of that Image. And last of all came that huge bell, béeing of twenty tunne weight, drawne by thrée thousand and fiue hundred men (not being possible to be drawne by oxen or horses) in manner following. They fastned sixe excéeding long hawsers, or mighty great gable ropes in six lengths to the frame whereon the bell was placed. In this ranke of ropes were placed those thrée thousand and sixe hundred men, with litle cordes ouer their shoulders, fastned to the great hawsers, drawing after the manner of our Westerne barge-men héere in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="23"/> The poyse of the Bell was so g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at, that passing a∣long the stréetes of <HI>Musco</HI> (being paued wyth great square péeces of timber sette close one by another) the woodde of the frame or carriage whereon the bell was drawne, set the timber of the stréets on fire, through both the woods chasing togither, so that some were faine to followe hard after, to throwe on water, as the tim∣bers beganne to smoake. And thus was this bell and the Image eonueyed to the Friery, as hath afore béene sayde.</P>
<P>The next day following we tooke our iourney (that is to say, in mid Maie) towards Saint
<HI>Nicolas</HI> to take shipping, which was some sixe wéekes passage by land and riuer. During all which time, we saw nothing, in a maner, but woods and water. But being come to the sea side, being the place where wée were to take ship, we stayed there one moneth for prouision for our iour∣ney.</P>
<P>In which time we were diuers times inuited aboorde English shippes, where we were roially banquetted at the Agents charges and the merchants. To the solem∣nization of which banquets we had thrée hundred hun∣dred great shot. And as we stayed there, one Maister
<HI>Megricke</HI> a merchant came from <HI>Musco,</HI> and brought the Friers two letters wyth hym, reporting that the Lord Chauncallor, in satisfaction of the wrong and ill vsage he extended to sir <HI>Anthony,</HI> sent after the Frier to the borders, who tooke both his letters and all his substance that he had deceitfully and lewdly gotten in many yeares before in the <HI>Indiaes</HI> from him, leauing him not so much as his Friers wéede: and whether hée caused his throate to be cut, it was vncertayne, but not vnlike.</P>
<P>Thus, as this lewd wretch had (as peraduenture he
<PB N="39" REF="23"/>thought) passed the pikes of Gods iudgements bent a∣gainst him, and threatening his ruine, for his seuerall villanies, and that (as to him perhappes it séemed) hée was nowe euen entring the confines of his owne coun∣trey, furnished with Letters in his commendation, from the Persian mighty Potentate, to his liege lord the king of <HI>Spaine,</HI> whereby hée thought to haue attai∣ned (notwithstanding his former leud life in the <HI>Indies</HI>) great reputation and preferment, euen then was hée ouertaken wyth a vengeance, and payed home with a mischiefe, to the vtter losse of his Letters, wherein so much hée ioyed, his substance that was all his liue∣loode, and (as it is most likely) of his life, the leudnesse whereof brought vppon him these vnexpected (yet well deserued) miseries.</P>
<P>A good caueat for all those, that vnder God almigh∣ties coate, will play all diuellish prankes, whereof there are but too many (in these last dayes, and therefore the worst dayes) crept into his holy church, in all quarters of Christendome, making the same sacred house of pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣er (which ought with all prayer and holy indeuor to bée preserued from all pollution and polluted persons) a very denne of théeues, as it is in the Gospel, that walke continually in shéepes clothing, but inwardely they are rauening Woolues: They are knowne by theyr workes.</P>
<P>From hence wée tooke shippe for <HI>Stoade,</HI> béeing sixe wéekes vppon the Sea, ere wée coulde recouer it. In which time we were continually tossed and tum∣bled with contrary Windes: and once had béene like to haue béene vtterly cast away, so that wée all were o∣uerwhelmed in despayre, as wée were at poynt to be in the Sea, but that (by Gods protection and direction) we (past all expectation) fell vppon the Flie. Where,
<PB N="40" REF="24"/>(hauing diuers Letters of sir <HI>Anthonies</HI> to his friendes in
<HI>England</HI>) I parted from hin (he holding his course to∣ward the Emperor of
<HI>Germany:</HI>) from thence I came to the <HI>Tassel</HI> then to the <HI>Firme:</HI> so to the <HI>Hage:</HI> from the <HI>Hage</HI> to <HI>Vlushing:</HI> And finally, from thence to
<HI>Douer,</HI> where I landed in the middest of the moneth of Sep∣tember, in the thrée and fortieth yéere of the Quéenes Maiesties raigne, and in the yéere of our Lorde God, one thousand sixe hundred and one.</P>
