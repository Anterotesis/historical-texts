<P>Suerly (neighbour) I can tell you of very good newes, wherat (I trust to God) we all shall reioyse, &amp; this is the matter: I came no sooner into the Citty, and had gotten a Chapman for my buttons, (but in comming by a Smiths For∣ge) I heard say: there was a worthy Parlament appoynted and a gratious day set, wherin (euery man, conserning his religion) should be permitted freely to speake without any lett, or interruption: and also heard without any perceality, And then whosoeuer hath the best on his syde, in the Trueth; it was concluded that his religion should take place, he preferred of the <HI>Kinge:</HI> and the Trueth set vp aboue all.</P>

<P>Suerly I would say then that this Realme should be most happy of all nations vnder the Sonne, yea and moreouer that the Lord would blesse and pro∣sper such magistrates in all things that they tooke in hand: Now therefore I pray thee tell me more of this matter, but wast thou in deed from the beginning to the end of this parley?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Balt.</SPEAKER>
<P>This was no doubt a maruellous good waie for to bring all to one vniformity of Religion, as also for to fynde out the Trueth: [if so be the King &amp; majestrates, when they haue harde all spe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke; cā discerne the Trueth and true re∣ligion from all others] which thing they may easily doe when as the Lord shall see it good, for as much as the Trueth is playne, and seeketh no corners, and they also Gods Ministers appoynted to that end, but yet thou hast not tolde me what was sayd to this matter, nor what ensued therupon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Then sayd the King this mans consell is very good: let therefore pro∣clamation go forth and let them come before vs [to wit] of euery Religion one: and then shall euery one say his mynde freely conserning his Religion, and

<P>After such tyme as they all (kneeling vpon their knees) had craued perdon, and lisence euery man to speak freely his mynde, vvithout any inter∣ruption, for the profe of his Religion, and the manifesting of the Trueth, and that free liberty vvas graunted them.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ben</SPEAKER>
<P>Then the Catholi{que} after his humble submission made to the K. and to the Honourable and vvorshipfull there assembled) he sayd.</P>
<P>Most Noble Prince, &amp; you all most Honourable &amp; worshipfull audience: In as much as you haue most graciously graunted me to speake for my Religion and the Trueth, so I most humbly beseech you all to heare me: Be it knowne vnto you all that the Catholi{que} generall Religion, had her first foundacion, as it is thought, neare vpon 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. hundred yeares past, and hath remayned in force [and no other generall Religion, among the Christians with in <HI>Europe,</HI> knowen or fre∣quented] vntill about 80. yeares past, that one <HI>Matin Luther</HI> (some<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ymes a ffryer)
<PB REF="4"/> tooke vpon him, vpon a displeasure taken aganst y<SUP>e</SUP> Pope, to vvryte dispitefully there agaynst: and this our Religion vvas instituted acc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rding to the holy scriptures by a generall councell of holy Fathers: For after such tyme as they, out of a great zeale towards the Trueth beheeld the increase of all Iniquity amongst the People, in somuch as <HI>Chr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st</HI> and his doctrine vvas almost forgotten: yea and more ouer fearing least, in processe of tyme, the Natiuety, Death, and Passion of <HI>Christ,</HI> together vvith his doctrine, lyfe and miracles, as also the doctrine, lyfe and miracles of the Prophets, Apostles, Euangilests, and holy fathers, should likevvise be altogether forgotten, especially n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w in these last lisencious dayes, vvherin they vnderstood, in the <HI>Spirite,</HI> that all iniquity vvould abound, lyke as it is come to passe at this day: Then they thought it good to call a generall Councell at the vvhich counsell they ordayned, not vvithout the holy Ghost, the festiuall dayes throughout the yere, like as they yet remayne in y<SUP>e</SUP> Church at this day) some in commemoration of Christes Natiuety, some of his circumsi∣cion: some of his Death: some of his Resurrection, and some of his Assention into heauen, &amp;c. Likewise they ordayned other Festiuall dayes in commemora∣tion of the deaths and martirdomes of holy saints, videlicet. Prophets, Apostles, Euangelists Martirs, and confessors, &amp;c. They haue also ordayned holy sacra∣ments and ceremonyes, together vvith an vniformity of God-service, to be vsed in the Church onely to houlde in memory before the People (in their right significations) those holy things vvhich the gospel of Iesu Christ requireth in the Deede) of all men: and yet notwithstanding vvere then (almost of all Peo∣ple) forgotten: Moreouer they ordayned and established, that the <HI>Gospells</HI> and <HI>Epistles,</HI> &amp;c. should be (as a New Testament) coadioyned to the olde: and read dayly in the Churches for holy scripture, and so to be taken for euer: they also ordayned and built many Churches for holy vse, Fastings, prayers, Almesdeeds, confession of sinnes, vvith contricion and satisfaction to be made for the same, with many other good things more vvhich vvere too longe to re∣syte: And now (right noble and honourable audience) in what Feare, obedience, and reasonablenes the People vvere houlden (euen vntill this our last Age) vnder Catholick Religion, and her sacraments and cerem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nyes, I need not much to speake of, but vvill rather leaue it to the Iudgmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and consideration of all those that be vvise and of auncient yeares among you, &amp; knew their con∣uersation: And therefore (to be shorte) I hold my Catholi{que} Religion to be of most antiquety, ordayned by y<SUP>e</SUP> consent of the holy Ghost, and grounded vpon the Trueth And thus I conclude, who soe houldeth vpon the Catholiq Reli∣gion (In his Right Institucion he houldeth vpon the True Religion: And who soe houldeth vpon the Catholi{que} Church houldeth vpon the true Churche: And thus he ended.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Balt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now surely (neighbour Benion) if this vvere his talke, and if this be true vvhich he hath sayd: then this is the Catholi{que} Religion (as I thincke) layd on such a ground or foundacion, bringing also with it such antiquety; that I know not presently to the contrary, but he is lyke to beare a ray the best

<P>Then the Protestant (after humble submission &amp;c.) sayd: O most ex∣cellent Prince together vvith all you Honourable and worshipfull, let me freely speake before you: It is not vnknowne vnto you all at this present that this Popish Religion [although I graunt she mought happely haue had some rea∣sonable ground in her first Institution] hath b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n (since that tyme) diuersly &amp; son∣dry wis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, altred &amp; patched, in somuch as sondry Popes haue added sundry sere∣monyes, Videlicet. some holy water, some holy bread, some other haue set vp (as bookes fot the vnlearned to looke vpon certaine Images, &amp; some haue graunted that oblations should be made vnto them, some other that sight should be set before them other some haue alowed (for the vnlearned) beades for to nom∣ber theyr prayers withall: And some haue likewise (for monyes cause) graun∣ted out perdon for sinnes, some in one maner some in an other: yea and their service▪ wherin they ment to serve God, was in a language that the People vnderstood not [what should I speaka of Masses, Trentalts, and Dirges to be sung for the Dead Hallowing of Palmes, of Crosses, Churches and Church∣yeards, likewise of Christning and hallowing of Bells &amp;c.] And this supersti∣tion continued (like as he sayd therin right well) till M<SUP>r</SUP>. Doctor <HI>Martin Luther,</HI> that famous Clarke, vvho hath disclosed all their superstition, Idolatry, Coui∣tousnes, and whordome &amp;c. vvhich tyme vve God be thancked) haue had for the most part this our protestant Religion, vvherin the Gospell or Trueth is sincearely Preached: all superstition, Idolatry and abhomination altogether put downe, and god service in the mother tongue, so that now euery Carter &amp; Cobler can whistle and sing psalmes, and euery man can reason and talke of the scriptures in euery place freely where they come: yea moreouer euery Bishop and Minister may haue his wife &amp;c. And now (right honorable Audience.) what fruites and freedom this our liberty of the gospell hath brought vvith it, since we began to preach, I need not to resyte: but vvill referre that and all that I haue sayd, vnto your vvisdoms to consider of: Thus I conclude [Right No∣ble and vvorshipfull] that my Religion (set out and allowed by the Kinge and his Counsell) hath his ground and foundacion from Christ and his Apostles, and therefore of greater antiquitie then the Catholike Religion by an hundred yeares and more▪ and is therefore the best, and the gospell vvhich vve preach (say I:) that is the Trueth. And therewith he made an end.</P>

<P>Then stood vp the Puritan, and (after submission done) he sayd, most high and renoumed Prince together with you all that be Honourable and wor∣shipfull, like as ye haue heard these 2. men tell their tales concerning the ground of their Religions, and the Trueth: euen so I beseech you heare me: It is vvell knowen vnto you all that I haue bin, euen for the Lord my God his cause, zea∣lous this 30 yeares and more, in so much as I haue bin expulced the Vniversi∣tyes: depriued of my liuings: runne here and there, euen for my Conscience cause, &amp;c and therefore haue matter so well against thee O <HI>King</HI> and thy Lawes, as also against them both and their Religions that haue here spoken: As f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r thee thou settest vp superstitious lawes vvhich are not correspondent to Gods lawes, and therefore I will not obey them: And now to answere the Catholike and his <HI>Antichristian</HI> Religion; I need not, for asmuch as the Protestant hath sufficiently answered him. But as conserning the Protestant and his Religion (vvhich he so extolleth aboue all other) I am right vvel able to reproue him, almost in an 100. places vvhich he hath altogether taken out of the Romish sincke, or stincking Popish puddle: like as you may easily smell from wence they came; if you do but a little holde vp your heads and beholde the situation of your Chur∣ches, how they yet stand East and West your steeples also full of Bells your Quiers and Alters, together vvith Coaps, vestments and cornerd caps: Tippets, Rotchets, Sirplusses, processions singings, organs &amp;c.

For that cause (right Honourable audience) I beseech you in the bowels of Iesu Christ, that you vvoulde once ouerthrowe and cleane roote out for euer all such Antichristan memorials aforesayd of that Babilonish hoore, so that nothing remayne vpon the Earth in any remembrance of her: And then may you reforme Religion (as we shall Instruct you) after the maner of the best reformed Churches in all <HI>Europe.</HI> And vntill that tyme we wil ney∣ther obey you nor your lawes, and Institutions: [for in such case say we; it is better to obey God then men.] And thus I conclude Right Noble and worship∣full: forasmuch as our zeyle standeth more towards God and his lawes then to∣wards the lawes and ordinances of men; Therefore we (who are aboue, in our ministration, men or Angels doe holde our Religion to be the best, because we seeke the reformation of the Church in all things that are amisse: and more∣ouer we haue our foundation from <HI>Ezechia, Iosia, Iudas Machabeus,</HI> &amp;c. and for that cause of greater antiquitie then them both And our ministration (which we vse and teach among our Colleges in our exercises, and nightly conven∣tikles) is the Trueth.

<P>Last of all stood vp this playne Plowman [whose Religion was vn∣knowen: although he had bin so long tyme▪ by all these 3 aforsayd suspected &amp; bruted for an Hereti{que}] And (falling downe vpon his knees) he sayd: O most puissant Prince together vvith all your Honorable and vvorshipfull in this present Parlament assembled.

<P>You haue heard of these 3.

(namely this Protestant) beholding the ma∣ny-maner abuses and disorderlynesse of life which hath bin now in these latter dayes, found in this Cotholi{que} and his Religion: and for the vvhich
<PB REF="6"/> no doubt he hath receiued greate chastisment of the Lord, and his Ministers hath declared forth (to his great reproach) many of the same abuses before you all very rightly as they vvere, and moreouer (out of a great zeale) hath commended his owne Religion for the best which thou (O king) hast now appointed and set vp among vs: <HI>Videlicet,</HI> the declaring forth of the gospell and holy scriptures among vs. The seruice vsed and read in y<SUP>e</SUP> mother tongue, to thend all mought heare and vnderstand what is sayd, and then followe the same vvhich is good: as likewise the sacraments &amp; ceremonies ministred in the same tongue, to thend all subjects mought be holden vnder godly and manly obedience, and hue according to the scriptures in one vniformity of Religion according to the kings good meaning therein.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Psalm.</HI> 1. <HI>and.</HI> 15.24. <HI>Math.</HI> 25. <HI>d.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> All these [say I] were it accomplished in the deed and in the Trueth is a very good Religion, also vvere very vvell sayde of him as out of a singuler good zeale.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>After such tyme as I had considered the many-maner of Religions, Sects, and Opinions, (gentle Reader) that are now risen vp out of mens high knowledge and goodthinking▪ and whereout (for the most parte) pro∣seedeth also all contention, Envy, Disobedience, Rebellion, Lying, Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k∣byting, Slaundering, Imprisoning, Killing, &amp; Murdering, &amp;c, together with al liberty of life in committing wickednes, which is now frequented (without feare or shame) among the children of men. I tooke this deuise in hand for six speciall causes.</P>
<P>The first was for that the Magistrats (who are Gods ministers on earth) mought the better remember their office and calling, and how that they are appointed of the Lord to suppresse euill, Disobedience, Falshood, and wickednes: and to maintayne Gods obedience, Trueth, or godlynes of lyfe.</P>
<P>The second was for that all simple and ignorant people, mought see how easi∣ly men may be seduced [now in these dangerous dayes] through faire speeches, and outward shewes of holines: yet neuerthelesse I am not against the right Cath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>li{que}, the true Protestant, or the perfect Praecisian, so long as they holde them to Obedience in the holy life aforesayd.</P>
<P>The third was for that my hope standeth in y<SUP>e</SUP> Lorde, there are many good willing hearts to the righteousnes yet remayning vpon the earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>2.</HI> Cor. <HI>5.</HI> c.d. <HI>6.</HI> c. Rom. <HI>8.</HI> a. c.</NOTE> who once knowing the Trueth, (and what euerlasting felicitie it bringeth with it) will not (by any sinister meanes of the disobedient and rebellious route) be drawne away therefrom (whether it be then by theyr smothe speeches, cruell threats, feare of Persecution, Blasphemyes, Tyranous handling, Imprysonments,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>2.</HI> Cor. <HI>10.</HI> a. b. c. <HI>1.</HI> Pet. <HI>2.</HI></NOTE> Vnjustice, or most cruell death that they can deuise (but will rather indevour them still to liue vnder Obedience to God and gouernours &amp; so exercise them dayly in the godly life (that right Religion, fast grounded on the vnconfutable Trueth) wherein the Lord had alwayes, still hath, and for euermore shall haue his pleasure and delight.</P>
<P>The fourth cause was this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. <HI>b.</HI></NOTE> for that all men [if it were possible] mought see or vnderstande that the good life is not so slight a thing as many men make accompte of. For the Lorde looketh not so mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h vpon the outward oblations, Sacrifices, Seruices, or Ceremonyes, which the man offereth or vseth for to serue him withall, as he doeth vpon the single heart of the man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. <HI>51.</HI> d. Ioh. <HI>4.</HI> c. Mar. <HI>12.</HI> c.</NOTE> in his Obedi∣ence and good lyfe [for the Lorde will be honoured onely (of his) in spirit and Trueth] therefore the Oblations, Seruices and Ceremonies, are respected of the Lorde for the good hearts cause and nor the euill hearted respected for the Oblations, Seruices, or ceremonies cause: Example by Cain and Abell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen <HI>4.</HI> a.</NOTE> they both offered sacrifice to the Lord: The one (for the bloudynes of his heart) his
<PB REF="10"/> Oblation was refused. And the other (for the singlenes of his heart) his Obla∣tion was accepted. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The fift cause was for to answere and satisfie all such as praesently stand (at the gaze as it were afarre-of) wayghting what will come of this my Religion, or els doubting of the goodnes and contynuance thereof. &amp;c.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. <HI>c.</HI></NOTE>And the sixt or last cause is this, for that I (who haue bin these many yeres most Injuriously slaundered and defamed: most cruelly persecuted, and Impri∣soned, as also most dispitefully spoyled and Impouerished to my vtter discredit and vndoing: Like as some that be honourable (if they remember it) can part∣ly tell) am still ready (during lyfe) to answere boldly for my felfe: beleefe, and Religion in the Trueth: And therefore (for the clearing of my selfe) and for the recouering of my good name [which I esteeme aboue golde and syluer] I am bolde to dedicate this my deuise to her Majesty, and to make knowne (there through) my Religion openly: And moreouer I meane hereafter [by Gods grace] and vnder correction and submission of my Prince, to perswade all my friends, and acquaintance, whether they be then <HI>Catholi{que}s, Protestants, Puritans,</HI> or what other Religions soeuer [so much as I may in the Lorde] to inclyne theyr hearts wholely to lyue vnder such obedience and godlynes of lyfe, as is aforesayde: Also to pray for the <HI>Queenes Majesty</HI> and al the honourable of his priuie Counsell, for that they mought so maintayne the gospell of <HI>Iesus Christ,</HI> whereby the <HI>Trueth</HI> mought get the victorie in all our hearts: To the end all mought become one in <HI>Christ,</HI> And <HI>Christ</HI> one in all.
