<HEAD>J. LUDOLPHUS TO THE Courteous Reader.</HEAD>
<P>AT length I present you with my <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Historie, long-promis'd, long expected by my friends. Nor will this delay be wonder'd at by those that consider how I am ty'd to public duty and employment, utterly dissonant from these sort of Studies. Beside which, there were many other Reasons. For I had collected indeed the Body of the matter from the Writings and Discourses of <HI>Gregory</HI> the <HI>Habessinian,</HI> but the Circumstances of time and place, and the names of persons were yet wanting. So that there was Timber and Bricks for the Building, but only Lime and Cement was wanting. Moreover after so many Fables had been Printed upon this subject, I thought it would not be so pru∣dently done to utter more novelty upon the credit of one single person; lest a new truth might be lookt upon as a new Tale. At length having got into my hands <HI>Balthazer Tellez,</HI> from whom as well to supply what I wanted, as also to confirm what might seem to be doubtfull, yet then likewise I wanted Leisure. Which when the most Serene <HI>Saxo-Gotan</HI> Dukes had indulg'd me, I Translated my family to <HI>Frankfort</HI> upon the <HI>Main,</HI> to the end that I might have the benefit of several famous Libraries in that Noble City, and the opportunity of a Learned Con∣versation, and by that means accomplish my intended work, which by Gods Assistance I did in six weeks.</P>
<P>After this, when all was ready for the Press, there still wanted what was necessary to forward the Publishing of this work. A proper <HI>Ama∣nuensis</HI> to transcribe the whole matter, and to attend upon the Cor∣rection of the Impression; which my occasions would not permit me to do; and then in the next place such Forraign Characters as this work requir'd, which Impediments were also at last remov'd. For there was a certain Young Gentleman recommended to me, eminent for his Lear∣ning and integritie, by name <HI>John Henry, Majus,</HI> a Student in Theology, and the Oriental Tongues. Who being well skill'd in the Hebrew Lan∣guage, and the Dialect of the Rabbins, by my help easily made himself Master of the <HI>Ethiopic,</HI> and so fitted himself for the imployment I design'd Him. He therefore by my directions made the heads of the Chapters, the Sections, the Index, and Translated the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> into Latin, assisted the work and put it forward, taking upon him the whole Correction of it: For which reason I can recommend his deserts the more justly to all good and learned Men.</P>
<P>The Printing part was undertaken by <HI>Balthasar Christopher Wustius,</HI> as well for that he was well known among Forainers, as because he had a Printing House furnished with all sorts of Letters for Foraign Langua∣ges. He also caused the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> and <HI>Amharic</HI> Characters to be engrav'd in Copper by the famous <HI>John Adolphus Schmide,</HI> and afterwards to be cast for farther use. But these could not be brought to perfection, so soon
<PB REF="3"/>
as the Compositers requir'd, and therefore there was a necessitie of mixing some old and less elegant, with the new and neater Characters.</P>
<P>As to the Work it self, I have said enough in the Proem: No man understandeth the warts and defects better than my self. Therfore I resolv'd to deferr the Publishing till newer and fuller relations return'd out of <HI>Ethiopia;</HI> or that I might receive them from the bordering Regi∣ons, as being furnished for that purpose with very great and most gene∣rous Recommendations, till I had brought my design to a full and elaborate perfection. But many Illustrious men, and my most honour'd friends, interceded with me, telling me, <HI>That never any thing came forth perfect at first in all its parts: And that therefore this History was no longer to be conceal'd from the Christian and Learned World, which it concerned to know these things: For that if any thing should fall out hereafter worthy of remark, it might be put into an Appendix, or added to a new Edition.</HI> Which makes me hope for pardon from the more Candid Reader, if his desire or expectation be not satisfied in all particulars. For I relate not altoge∣ther things beheld with my own eyes, but what I have either read my self or heard from others, yet congruous to Truth and well cohering between themselves. If I have not reach'd the sence of my Authors, I will amend upon admonition; or else return my thanks and satisfaction to the admonisher. That I should please all men, a thing which never mor∣tal yet attained, none in prudence can exact from me; nor dare I hope to have done it. However I propose to my self to injure no man, but every where to study moderation. So they who take offence, ought to be offended with my Authors not with me. There are some perhaps who believe I might have spoken more in matter of Religion, others that I have said too much, certainly I had rather I could have omit∣ted all; so ungratefull to me are the Altercations of Christians among themselves in matters of Religion, chiefly where the Decisions tend to Force and Arms. For they who think mutual Love and Charity is only due to men of their own sect, certainly wander much from the scope of Christian perfection, according to the precepts of Christ and his Apostles.</P>
<P>I have not aim'd at my own advantage, nor my own increase of Repu∣tation, hard to be acquir'd, now the world is so fertile in soaring Genius's, I have only endeavoured to be in some measure profitable to the Commonwealth of Christianity and Learning, out of a peculiar kindness, to that, for ought we know, most ancient Nation of the <HI>Ha∣bessines:</HI> I confess I have frequently bewail'd their misfortune for this, that the enmitie ran so high between them and the Portuguesses, that for their sakes all the other Europeans are suspected to that Nation, and not permitted to have any commerce among them. But it has afforded me much more matter of grief, that there should be such and so great Animosity nmong the Western Christians, that as things stand, there is no Counsell or help to be afforded for the ease and restitution of the Eastern Church, or for the suppression of those Barbarous <HI>Idolaters.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF ETHIOPIA: OR THE KINGDOM <HI>of the</HI> ABESSINES.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Am now about to write the History of the <HI>Abessines;</HI> concerning whom, there have been many large, but few true Relations. For these People having translated themselves from the Maritime Regions of the <HI>Arabian Gulf,</HI> into the more upland Parts of <HI>Africa,</HI> by reason their Commerce with Foreigners has been very inconsiderable, have been known to very few of the <HI>Europeans.</HI> Besides that the Name of <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> which they assume to themselves, is common to so many Nations, that it has render'd their History very ambiguous; for that many things generally spoken of the <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> were more particularly attributed to the <HI>Abessines.</HI> Neither were they wanting to their own honour, while they appropriated to themselves whatever was said either in Scri∣pture or elsewhere to their advantage.</P>
<P>Others there are, who to wast their idle hours, and de∣signing some fabulous Inventions, or to represent the Plat∣form of some Imaginary Common-Wealth, have chosen <HI>Ethiopia</HI> for the Subject of their Discourse. Believing they could not more pleasantly Romance, or more safely license

<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
Age, and then an Exile, for that contrary to the King's Com∣mand, he had followed the Fathers of the Society into <HI>In∣dia,</HI> and consequently exercised in Misfortune, he had laid aside all <HI>Levity</HI> and <HI>Ostentation,</HI> the Vices of <HI>Fortunate Youth.</HI> So that although in truth, I was sufficiently able, by vertue of his Instructions, and the knowledge which I obtained from him of the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Language, to have out done all those that have gone before me, yet I was unwilling to refell the Errors of others upon the Credit of one single Person, till I had more Authorities to support me.</P>
<P>Nor did I therefore underake this difficult Task, only to consume my leisure hours in confuting the Errors, or mu∣stering up the different Opinions of Authors, without any prospect of <HI>Publick-Benefit.</HI> The History it self of this Nati∣on deserves the Labour of an Accurate Pen. For whether you consider the Temper of the Clime, or the Condition of the Soyl, you shall hardly find in any other Part of the World more frequent Miracles of Nature.</P>
<P>The Countrey is situated between the <HI>Tropic of Cancer,</HI> and the <HI>Equinoctial Line,</HI> and enjoys a wonderful variety of Air: The Champion Levels feel the Heat, the Hilly Parts are no less subject to Cold. For this reason, the Thunders are most dreadful, and frequent Tempests terrifie both Man and Beasts. Their Prodigious Mountains over-look the Clouds themselves. Neither <HI>Olympus</HI> nor <HI>Athos,</HI> here accoun∣ted Wonders; nor <HI>Atlas</HI> it self, which the Ancients fancied to be the Support of Heaven, are to be compared with them. Their Rocks of various Shapes and Figures, so ama∣zingly steep as not to be ascended, yet inhabited. Their surrounded Valleys rugged, and representing <HI>Abysses</HI> for profun∣dity. Metals they also have; but chiefly Gold, did they know how to find and dig it forth. Their dryest places in Winter are overflowed in Summer: For those Advantages which the Rains afford the Fields in other places, the Ri∣vers supply in <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> Among those Rivers, <HI>Nilus</HI> for vastness and fame, far exceeds all the Rivers of the whole World: Whose Fountains so diligently sought by the Anci∣ents are not only here found, but it also now appears, that the River <HI>Niger</HI> is no more than its left Channel. Nor do all the Rivers of <HI>Habassia,</HI> as in other Places, empty them∣selves into the Sea, but are some of them suckt up in the Sand; so that it is more difficult to find the Mouths of those,
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
than the Sources of other Streams. Plants they have of ad∣mirable Vertue; and Beasts of all sorts, many of which are unknown to us. The largest also both of Foul and four-footed Beasts are here to be found. The celebrated Unicorn, so curiously sought for in all other Corners of the World, was first seen here. Cattel without number, much larger than ours, feed in the vast Woods, affording Pasture sufficient as well for the Wild as Tame. Nor is the variety of the Nati∣ons and People less to be admired; so strangely differing in Language, Customs, and Ceremonies, that it may be thought some distinct Part of the World, rather than a particular King∣dom.</P>
<P>However all <HI>Abessinia</HI> Obeys one King, who by reason of certain Princes that are subject to him, calls himself <HI>Ne∣gusa nagast zait joperia,</HI> King of the Kings of <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> He derives his Descent from <HI>Solomon</HI> King of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> by an ambitious, tho dubious Claim; defending the long series of his Family, whether true or false, with the force of Anti∣quity. However it be, this is certain, That the Monarchy of the <HI>Abessines,</HI> and the Royal Line, are no less Ancient than any among the <HI>Europeans.</HI> And for their Power, they were formerly more Potent than any other of the <HI>African</HI> Kings: But their Wars in the preceding Age with the <HI>Adelenses,</HI> has brought them very low. Afterwards they were so debilitated by the Fury of the <HI>Gallani,</HI> that <HI>Abessinia</HI> is scarce to be found in <HI>Habessinia</HI> it self, if you compare it with what it was in the times of <HI>Alvarezius.</HI></P>
<P>But that which deserves the greatest admiration is the an∣tiquity of the Christian Religion, which first began under S. <HI>Athanasius,</HI> Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> at what time <HI>Frumen∣tius</HI> Preached among them; the Opinions and Ceremonies of which Church they still retain. So that many Primitive Rites in other Places obsolete, are here still in Use. But that deplorable Schism which arose in the Council of <HI>Calcedon,</HI> for which they alledge other Causes than our Writers do, withdrew the <HI>Abessines</HI> all together from the <HI>Catholick</HI> Church, at that time Flourishing; while they followed the Patriarch of the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> and rejected the Patriarch of the <HI>Melchites.</HI> Yet all this while for so many Ages they have suffered no con∣siderable Change in their Divine Worship till the beginning of this last Century, at what time being split into Divisions by the Artifices of the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> they have been cruelly shaken

with Civil Discord and Bloody Wars; some Adhering to the <HI>Romish,</HI> other the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Religion.</P>
<P>Of which and other things it is our Design to treat more fully in this our History; and so to handle the matter, as to discourse in the First Book, Of Natural Things; as the Situation and Names of the several Counties, the Temper of the Climate, the Condition of the Soyl, the several Cu∣stoms and Languages of the Nations and Inhabitants. In the Second Book, Of the Political Government, the Succession of their Kings, their Laws, their Acts of War, the Revenue of the Kingdom, and the like. In the Third, Of their Ecclesiastical Affairs, the beginning of the Christian Religion, and its Advance in those Countries, their Differences with the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Church. And Lastly, in the Fourth Book, Of their Domestick Concerns, and Private Oeconomy.</P>

<ARGUMENT>

<P>IN <HI>Africa,</HI> above <HI>Egypt,</HI> beyond<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sub Egypto</HI> most write, but erroneously.</NOTE> <HI>Nubia,</HI> lies <HI>Habas∣sia</HI> very near between the Eighteenth and Sixteenth Degree of <HI>Northern</HI> Latitude; being<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>So</HI> B.

Which notwithstanding, almost all Geographers and Historians have hitherto asserted; whether it were that they did not rightly understand the Sayings and Writings of others; or whether deceived by the Credit of <HI>Paulus Jovius,</HI> who writes that the Kingdom of <HI>Sceva, (Sewa</HI> or <HI>Scheva)</HI> beholds the <HI>An∣artick Pole</HI> elevated in two and twenty degrees; whereas it is in no place to be seen where <HI>Shewa</HI> lies. Which mistake as seems most probable, he too unwarily drew, not from the <HI>Abessines,</HI> utterly ignorant of those things, but from a certain Ancient Geographical Map of <HI>Africa;</HI> the Author of which has so far extended <HI>Habessinia,</HI> that he has joyned it to another Region known only to himself; fearing to seem ignorant of what lay between by leaving a space. As if it were a shame to be ignorant of that which flies the piercing examination of human wit, and can be no otherwise disco∣vered but by experiment.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> mores kilful in <HI>Spherical Discipline,</HI> by the Assistance of the <HI>Astrolabe,</HI> were the first who taught us that same true Latitude, from the <HI>North</HI> to the <HI>South,</HI> already mention'd.

A Sea that affords but little convenience for Harbors, full of Shelves and Quick-sands, and besides that, the Islands which belong to it are Untill'd, ill Inhabited, and labouring under such a scarcity of Water in the midd'st of the Sea, that they neither afford Accommodation nor Security to Strangers, for which reason they are but little visited.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the Division of <HI>Habessinia,</HI> into diverse Kingdoms and Regions.</HEAD>

Tellez</HI> reckons more. Others he omits. More remarkable Provinces. What the King of <HI>Habessinia</HI> possesss at this day.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Regions of which <HI>Ethiopia</HI> consists, are neither equally, nor with the same observance of number, but variously set down. Most of them enjoy the Name of the Kingdom, <HI>Menghest,</HI> or <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> in General; perhaps be∣cause in ancient times they had their proper Princes and pecu∣liar Laws, as we know that formerly <HI>Spain</HI> was divided into several Kingdoms of the same nature. The rest, in the <HI>Am∣haric</HI> Dialect, are called <HI>Shumet,</HI> Prefectures, which are not however Governed by <HI>Vice-Roys,</HI> but are under peculiar Go∣vernours of their own; which being confounded with the Kingdoms so call'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hist. l. <HI>18.</HI></NOTE> must needs render the number of the Kingdoms uncertain. <HI>Paulus Jovius</HI> distinguishes the Em∣pire of the <HI>Habessines</HI> into more than forty Kingdoms; others add yet more, which are more easily set down in writing, than demonstrated.<NOTE PLACE="marg">In Epist. Ev. Johan.</NOTE> <HI>Matthew</HI> the <HI>Armenian,</HI> first Ambassador to the <HI>Portugals</HI> from the <HI>Abessines,</HI> will needs have<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Dam. à Goez. de legat.

P. <HI>Nicolaus Godignus,</HI> from the Relation of <HI>John Gabriel,</HI> a <HI>Por∣tugueze</HI> Collonel, a Person of great Fame, and one that had long resided in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> asserts, That the <HI>Abessine</HI> Empire, ac∣cording to its ancient Right, comprehends no less than twenty six Kingdoms, and fourteen Provinces. But he mixes some Neighbouring Kingdoms, which are no way Subject to the King of the <HI>Abessines,</HI> and some he also omits.<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Certainly <HI>Godignus</HI>'s enumeration is most confused: for the most part ill pro∣nounced, as <HI>Leca,</HI> for <HI>Waleka.</HI> And why does he reckon <HI>Adela,</HI> and <HI>Aucagurecè</HI> among the number of the Kingdoms, when the latter is onely the Metropolis and no King∣dom; watered by the River <HI>Hawashi</HI> (for so it ought to be written:) and yet confesses that the Inhabitants are no way Subject to the <HI>Abessine</HI> Emperor.</NOTE> How∣ever most certain it is, that we may safely reckon twenty, computing those which the <HI>Gallans</HI> have subdued. <HI>Gregory</HI> named thirty to me, adding perhaps some small ones, which others allow to be no more than Prefectures. These I shall reckon up from his own mouth, and as he wrote them down himself, that the<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">This was very necessary by reason of the great variation and corruption of Names, so frequent in all Authors.</NOTE> Reader may be assured of their true and genuine Pronunciation.

<P><HI>Amhara</HI> is now the most noble Kingdom of all <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> by reason of those inaccessible Fortified Rocks, <HI>Ghesen</HI> and <HI>Amhacel,</HI> where formerly the Kings Sons, excluded from the Kingdom, were secured; and is therefore accounted the Native Country of the late and present Kings, and of all the Nobility. It lies almost in the Center of <HI>Habessinia,</HI> having on the <HI>North</HI> the Kingdom of <HI>Bagemder;</HI> upon the <HI>West, Nile;</HI> and beyond that, the Kingdom of <HI>Gojam.</HI> Upon the <HI>South</HI> it views <HI>Walake,</HI> and <HI>Eastward</HI> beholds <HI>Angota.</HI> The Provinces that belong to it are these that follow:

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the Vulgar Chorographic Table or Mapp of <HI>Ha∣bessinia,</HI> and the Author's new one.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The New Mapp of the <HI>Habessines.</HI> The new one found fault with as Erro∣neous: Look'd on as ridiculous by <HI>Gregory;</HI> by reason of the ill writing and because of the ill understood Names of <HI>Barnagassus, Tigremahon, Am∣biancantiva,</HI> which are explained. The ambiguous powers of Letters. Advice to concert a certain Geographical Alphabet. The Authors contest about his own Mapps.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BUT to the End that all things may the more clearly appear, we shall produce a new Chorographical Mapp of <HI>Habessinia,</HI> the old one that goes begging about the World for an Author, being altogether uncertain. I was not a little asham'd to hear the sedulous <HI>Ethiopian, Gre∣gory,</HI> upbraiding as he did, the vanity and carelesness of our People, to obtrude such absurdities upon the Commonweal of Learning, and to defile otherwise most<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">As those of <HI>Ortelius, Jansonius;</HI> the <HI>Atlas</HI>'s of <HI>Gerand, Mercator, Bleau,</HI> and others.</NOTE> beautiful Pieces of Geography, with such fabulous impertinencies. While they made public to the World Mapps of such consequence,
<PB N="20" REF="16"/>
without any sufficient Authority, or any light by what Pen, of what Nation, or in what Language they were first written, as if they designed on purpose to deceive the Reader, that so he might not be in a Capacity to judge of the Truth: which if it were their aim, they did not miss of their intentions, in regard they led several persons, otherwise eminent, and of great judgment, into foul mistakes, who cryed up the Empire of the <HI>Habessines</HI> for the largest in the World, as being little less than all <HI>Europe,</HI> too unwarily trusting to their fictions.</P>
<P>When I first shewed the vulgar Mapps to <HI>Gregory,</HI> some∣times I made him laugh, sometimes I made him angry. For before I call'd to mind that the <HI>Latin</HI> Letters were to be pro∣nounced after the <HI>Portugal</HI> mannet, I asked him concerning the Kingdoms of <HI>Xoa, Gojam,</HI> and other Regions, from whence the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> had either taken away, or to which they had added the <HI>Latin</HI> Letters, <HI>a, d, do,</HI> as being their Articles of declension,<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot"><HI>As</HI> Abugno, <HI>for</HI> Bugna, Barua; <HI>worse</HI> Barua, <HI>for</HI> Dobarua; Amara <HI>for</HI> Amhara; Ambadora, <HI>for</HI> Ambadarho, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> without any regard to the Letter <HI>h.</HI> But when I expected an Answer, he knew not what I meant, till I pronounced for <HI>Ksoa, Shoa;</HI> for <HI>Goyam, Gojam,</HI> and so on∣ward: But he laughed outright when I question'd him con∣cerning the Kingdoms of <HI>Barnagassus, Tigremahon,</HI><NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">In the vulgar Tables also you shall find <HI>Tigre</HI> and <HI>Tigray,</HI> as if they were two distinct Kingdoms: Which error <HI>B. Telles</HI> severely reprehends. <HI>L. 1. Ch. 4.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Ambiancantiva.</HI> For after a short hesitation he understood them to be compound words, in which the Titles of the <HI>Vice-Roys,</HI> were conjoyned with the Names of the Regions over which they were made Governors; and besides that, very much corrupted by the <HI>Portugal</HI> pronunciation and spel∣ling. For <HI>Barnagasso</HI> in the <HI>Amharic</HI> Language extends it self to <HI>Bahr-Nagash,</HI> a compound word of <HI>Bahr</HI> which signi∣fies the Sea, and <HI>Nagash</HI> a Governour, as much as to say a Commander or Admiral at Sea. <HI>Tigremahon</HI> corruptly for <HI>Tigre-macuonen,</HI> that is to say, Judge or President of <HI>Tigre: Ambian-cantiva,</HI> for <HI>Dembea-cantiba,</HI> that is, Governour or Pre∣sident of <HI>Dembea.</HI> The same inference happens to the most noble City and Court of Royal Residence, <HI>Axuma,</HI> which ne∣ver appears in the Mapps, by reason that the <HI>Portugals</HI> pro∣nounce <HI>Axum, Acassum;</HI> for they cast away the <HI>A,</HI> as an Ar∣ticle of declension, and adding their own termination <HI>O,</HI> made
<PB N="21" REF="16"/>
it <HI>Cassumo.</HI> Upon which City we stood pausing a long time, before we could tell what to make of it. I pass by an innumerable company of other mistakes, which rendred the Mapp altogether useless to me. Nor is it to be doubted but the same thing often falls out in other Exotic Tables: So that unless a Man can divine the Language of the Author, or where he was born; it is impossible but he must read the Names of the plaes most extravagantly. For we find that because the Modern <HI>Europeans</HI> have no Letters of their own, but onely have accommodated the <HI>Latin</HI> Letters to their own sounds, it comes to pass, that one and the same Letter is variously pronounced by various Nations; which frequently appears in Consonants conjoyned. As for Example, <HI>Ch,</HI> among the <HI>Germans, Belgians</HI> and <HI>Polonians,</HI> is a rough Aspiration like the <HI>Hebrew</HI> ח, or the <HI>Greek</HI> Χ. Among the <HI>Italians Ch,</HI> is pronounced like a <HI>k,</HI> among the <HI>French</HI> like an <HI>Hebrew</HI> ש. But among the <HI>English, Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Portugueses,</HI> who alone genuinely pronounce the word <HI>China,</HI> there is a kind of hissing compos'd between the Letter <HI>Z.</HI> and <HI>sch.</HI> which the <HI>Italians</HI> express by a <HI>C</HI> before <HI>e</HI> or <HI>i;</HI> the <HI>Polonians</HI> by <HI>Ch,</HI> the <HI>Hebrews</HI> more lively in their ש, the <HI>Germans <HI>Sch,</HI></HI> the <HI>English</HI> by <HI>Sh,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Ch, the <HI>Italians</HI> Sc before <HI>e,</HI> and <HI>i;</HI> and which the <HI>Portugueses</HI> would do by their Letter <HI>X,</HI> but that they are unwilling to have it a superfluous Letter in their Alphabet.</P>
<P>For which reason it would be very requisite, that the Publishers of Foraign Mapps, should also Publish their Instructions, and tell the World according to what Pro∣nounciation, the Names of Countries and Cities ought to be read: Or else that in the compiling of some universal Geographical Work, care might be taken to add such an Index as should be the standard of Pronunciation in every Country, to prevent the common mistakes.</P>
<P>We must acknowledge that our Chorographick Table is not without its defects: For though <HI>Gregorie</HI> were sufficiently skill'd in the Names and Situation of places, yet he was ignorant of the Degrees of the Sphere and Elevation of the Pole. Therefore in the first Mapps of <HI>Habessinia</HI> which I made, I follow'd the Longitude and Latitude of the vulgar Tables; but because I found them false in that too, we thought it more prudence not to Publish any at all. I must confess being in company with certain Persons of Learning

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of the Nature of the Soil, Temper of the Air, Tempests, Winds, and such like Meteors.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Air uncertain. Wonderful effects of heat. The <HI>Torrid Zone</HI> is nevertheless habitable. The high places cold. No Snow. The temper and wholesomness of the Air. Horrid Thunders. A dirty Winter describ'd by <HI>Gregory.</HI> Diversity of Tempests in the same situation.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN so many and such various Regions, the Constitution of the Air is as various. In low and open places which the <HI>Abessines</HI> call <HI>Kolla,</HI> the heat of the Sun is intolerable, such as <HI>Seneca</HI> describes in these words. <HI>The stones burn as if neal'd in the fire, not onely in the middle of the day, but also toward the evening, the Silver unsoders; the footsteps of men are impatient of the scorching sand. The fastening of the standard melts:
<PB N="23" REF="17"/>
No exterior covering of outward Ornament remains.</HI> In which respect both coasts of the <HI>Red Sea</HI> have but a bad report; as also the Islands, especially <HI>Suaquena,</HI> whose heat <HI>Gregorie</HI> many times us'd to call <HI>Infernal.</HI> For said he, it excoriates the <HI>Skin, melts hard Indian wax in a Cabinet, and sears your shoos, like a red hot Iron.</HI></P>
<P>But these Persons consider'd not the nature of those People; that inhabit that Country; much less have they weighed with themselves, the strange Patience of those that covet rule and dominion, who can endure the parching beams of the Sun, and willingly too, though unus'd to those immode∣rate violences of raging heat. However the ancient Philoso∣phers were in a very great error that believ'd the<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Aristot. Meteorotog.</HI> L. <HI>2.</HI> c. <HI>11.</HI> and his followers.</NOTE> <HI>Torrid Zone</HI> unhabitable; or that the middle parts of the Earth, where the Sun continually moves, should be parch'd up with flames, and tosted with the raging fire.<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have a Proverb, he that is intent upon his own Interest, minds not in conveniences.</NOTE> Assuredly there are some Philosophers who deliver things uncertain and unprov'd for real and assured truths, and discourse in such a manner of the nature of the Air, the Heavens and the Stars, as if their residence had long been there. For that the Air is colder upon the Mountains, all Nations in their own Countries find by experience; but that the Air is cold of it self, and not warmed but by the repercussion of the Suns beams among the exhalations of the Earth, is the opinion of other sage Philosophers: which exhalations in the lower Region near the Earth rise more close and condens'd, in the upper parts, more thin and rarify'd; so that tho the lower parts frie with heat, high places freez, the cool nature of the Air not suffering any alteration through the defect of heat.</P>
<P>Therefore the higher you ascend the Mountains of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> from the coast of the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> the more temperate you shall feel the Air; insomuch that as <HI>Tellezius</HI> witnesses in many Regions of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> the Summer heats are more mild then in <HI>Portugal,</HI> so many degrees distant toward the North. Nay there are some Mountainous Countries, as in <HI>Samen</HI> where the cold is more dreaded than the heat. Nevertheless there falls none or very little Snow in those parts, only a certain small sort of Hail sometimes covers the ground, which at a
<PB N="24" REF="18"/>
distance looks like Snow. It was a thing not known to <HI>Gregorie,</HI> for as I Travelled with him over the Mountains of <HI>Tirol,</HI> toward the end of <HI>September,</HI> seeing some Snow that had fallen a little before, crying out <HI>Haritz, Haritz,</HI> full of admiration, he called it Meal. From such a temper of the Air it follows that the Country must needs be healthy; and consequently the Inhabitants sane and vivacious, insomuch that some of them live to a hundred years of Age. Onely in <HI>Tigra,</HI> toward the beginning of the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Spring, that is to say, in the Months of <HI>September</HI> and <HI>October,</HI> Feavers are very rise.</P>
<P>However this variety of the Air is the cause of most dreadful Thunders. Which when <HI>Gregory</HI> describ'd, he astonish'd his hearers. For upon the rising of several Tem∣pests altogether, the Skie is of a sudden cover'd over with black and thick as it were Globes of smokie Clouds; by and by the Thunder breaks forth on every side, ratling con∣tinually, with Lightning as incessantly flashing, enough to amaze the most resolute and most accustom'd to the noise. Their Rains are very violent, powering from the Clouds not by drops, but as it were in streams. With those the torrents being swell'd, rowle along with that rapid fury, that they carry Trees and Stones and all things before 'em. All their Rivers overflow; and then the high ways being either covered with water, or else all mirie and dirtie, 'tis a most tedious thing to Travel: And this enduring three Months together renders their Winters very unpleasant. <HI>Gregory</HI> describ'd the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Winter to me in these words.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">The <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Winters are not caus'd onely by the Rain which falls from the Skie; for the Earth also opens her mouth, and vomits up water. There is a Fountain in every man's house, if it stands low. And therefore we never Build in low places, but in high grounds: So many and so great Rivers, and Springs of water out of the Earth; and such violent Rains are no where the like to be seen as in our Country.</Q></P>
<P>This tempestuous weather is so troublesome and tedious to Forraigners, that in a dispute which happen'd between an <HI>Abossine</HI> and an <HI>Egyptian,</HI> about the excellency of their Countries, when the first vaunted to the latter, the natural fertilitie of <HI>Abessinia,</HI> the temperateness of the Air, their double Harvests, and other benefits of the Country, adding

withall, That the <HI>Egyptians</HI> cannot live without the assistance of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> in regard that <HI>Nilus</HI> fatten'd <HI>Egypt</HI> with the Mud of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> without which, both Man and Beast would pe∣rish for want of Sustenance; the <HI>Egyptian</HI> retorted upon the <HI>Abyssinian,</HI> upbraiding him with the prodigious Showers, the rapid Torrents, the steep and rugged Mountains, and the dreadful Thunders that render'd the Country so unplea∣sant; upon which the Victory was allow'd on his side.</P>
<P>Nor does the season of the Winter keep the same Months, nor the same Temperature in all places alike, tho the situa∣tion may be the same; for it is not only milder in some pla∣ces, sharper in others, but also in different Months from our Climate. Which was of old observ'd by<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">In the History of his Embassy, some Collections out of which are to be seen in <HI>Bibliothec.

<P>From the City of the <HI>Adulites</HI> as far as <HI>Aüe,</HI> the same Sum∣mer and Drouth affects the Air as with us. From <HI>Aüe</HI> to∣wards <HI>Axuma,</HI> the Winter is very rigorous, <HI>&amp;c. Gregory</HI> told me, That the Coast of the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> and all that two days Journey, from the Shore to the Mountains of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> the Winter keeps its Station in <HI>November, December,</HI> and <HI>Ja∣nuary,</HI> as in <HI>Europe;</HI> but they differ nothing in the Degrees of Latitude. So that it is not always true what some<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">See the Notes upon <HI>Cluverius</HI>'s Introduction to Geography, <HI>l. 1. c. 5.</HI> and <HI>Aristot. l. 2. de Meteorologic.</HI> who without experience writes, That the Heat and Cold do not exceed in regard of the Longitude, but in regard of the Latitude.</NOTE> Geographers have written, That the <HI>Perioeci,</HI> or those that dwell under the same Meridian, have the same Winter and Summer.</P>
<P>Now what the Winter of that Coast is, you may easily guess, from the answer of <HI>Gregory,</HI> who being ask'd upon a very sultry day, whether it were not very hot in <HI>Germany,</HI> made answer,</P>
<P>To day has been something hot: Such is the Winter in <HI>Suaqena,</HI> which is an Island upon that Coast.</P>
<P>Being ask'd concerning the Seasons of the Year, he an∣swer'd,</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="19"/>The Season <HI>Matzau,</HI> the Season of Flowers or the Spring.</P>
<P>The Season <HI>Tzadai,</HI> the Season of Harvest or <HI>Autumn.</HI></P>
<P>The Season <HI>Hagai,</HI> or the Summer.</P>
<P>The Season <HI>Crampt,</HI> or Winter.</P>
<P>Thus he reckon'd the four Seasons: But there is not the same reason for them, nor the same benefits by them, as with us; nor could <HI>Gregory</HI> himself reconcile them with ours.</P>
<P><HI>Matzau</HI> indeed may deservedly be call'd the Spring, be∣cause it succeeds the Winter, and covers the Fields with Grass and Flowers. It begins upon a certain day of the Month, that is, upon the 25th of <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Tzadai</HI> of the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> cannot be call'd properly <HI>Autumn,</HI> as <HI>Gregory</HI> imagin'd; for it is the second part of the year that succeeds the Spring, and exhilarates the Husband∣man with ripen'd Fruits, and therefore ought more truly to be call'd <HI>Summer.</HI> But how <HI>Hagai</HI> is to be interpreted, is a question; it is the third part of the year, yet cannot justly be call'd <HI>Autumn,</HI> in regard the <HI>Habessines</HI> are ignorant of any benefit they receive by it: They get no Vintage in, but are parch'd with extremity of Heat, and therefore they op∣pose this hottest time of the year to the sharpest Cold of Winter.</P>
<P>For which reason we rather ought to conclude, that there are but three Seasons among the <HI>Abyssines,</HI> that is to say, the Spring which begins upon the 25th of <HI>September.</HI> Then the Summer, which may be divided into two parts; the first, and the best, call'd <HI>Tzadai,</HI> which begins upon the 25th of <HI>December;</HI> and the last, and worst part, call'd <HI>Hagai,</HI> which begins upon the 25th of <HI>June,</HI> and ends upon the<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gregory</HI> differs from our Poet one day, who puts it upon the <HI>26th.</HI></NOTE> succee∣ding Winter, which is the third part of the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> year.</P>
<P>The Days and Nights in that Climate, being in a right Sphere, are, for the most part, always equal. Their Daw∣nings and Evenings much shorter than ours. <HI>Gregory</HI> won∣der'd, that it should be light when he could not see the Sun; and again, after Sun-set, that the Twilight should last so long. For there immediately after Sun-set it grows dark, and all the Stars, in the absence of the Moon, ap∣pear.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="19"/>The Winds, upon the Mountains frequent and pleasant, render the Air healthful and temperate; but in open and flat Levels, the Air, for want of motion, grows hot and un∣wholsom, especially in the Islands of the <HI>Red-Sea.</HI> This a certain Merchant attested, who carrying several rich <HI>Indian</HI> Commodities from the Port of <HI>Suaqena</HI> to the Court, and being ask'd by one of the King's Daughters, <HI>What there was that could not be purchas'd at the Port of</HI> Suaqena, answer'd, <HI>The Wind;</HI> that being only wanting in that place, otherwise a happy and pleasant Island.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>High Mountains. <HI>Lamalmona</HI> most dangerous. <HI>Amhara</HI> and <HI>Samen</HI> the gibbose part of <HI>Abyssinia;</HI> higher than the <HI>Alps</HI> and <HI>Pyreneans.</HI> Steep Rocks of a wonderful shape, not to be ascended without Ropes and Ladders.

Plains very rare, one great one in <HI>Dembea.</HI> The benefits of the Mountains, temperate Air, security and pleasantness of the Fountains.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ALL <HI>Habessinia</HI> is egregiously Mountainous: So soon as you have travell'd two days Journey from the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> you must presently climb the high Moun∣tains of <HI>Tigra;</HI> amongst which <HI>Lamalmona</HI> lifts up her head more lofty than the rest, which they that travel to the Royal Camp in <HI>Dembea,</HI> are forc'd to clamber over: The Steps of which, if they may be so call'd, are so dangerous, and the Path or Track so narrow, that if Company meet, Men and Horses giving the way, fall headlong into a bottomless Abyss, never to be any more seen. But not only this Region is the Plain that seems as it were planted with Mountains, <HI>Bagem∣dra, Gojam, Waleka, Shewa,</HI> and all the rest, <HI>Dembea</HI> ex∣cepted, are but one continued Chain of Mountains. Among the rest, the vast and high Mountains of <HI>Amhara</HI> and <HI>Samen</HI> are as it were the Embossment of <HI>Habessinia.</HI></P>
<P>Here are many <HI>Aorni,</HI> or Rocks of an<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">A Rock in <HI>India</HI> called <HI>Aornos,</HI> as being above the slight of a Bird, <HI>Curt. 8. n. 2.</HI> There are also Lakes of this name, but from another cause, for that the pestilent Exhalations that they send up, kill the Birds that fly over them, <HI>Plin. 2.4.</HI> by the <HI>Latins</HI> call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Averni.</HI></NOTE> incredible height and ruggedness, in so much, that, as <HI>Tellezius</HI> writes, they strike a terror into the Beholders; the <HI>Alps</HI> and <HI>Pyreneans,</HI> compar'd with the <HI>Abessine</HI> Mountains, are but low Hills. The Mountains of <HI>Portugal,</HI> tho very high, are but trifles to them.</P>
<P>Amongst those Mountains, and frequently in the Plain it self, and in the middle of the Fields, rise up Rocks every
<PB N="29" REF="20"/>
way steep, yet varying their shape; some looking a far off like Towers, some like Pyramids, some like four-square Towers built by Art, and so even on the sides, as if the Workman's hand had done it so; so that there is no way to get to the top but by the help of Ladders and Ropes, by which means they Crane up their Cattel, and other necessa∣ries: And yet so spacious at the top, that they contain Woods, Fields, Meadows, Fountains, and which is more wonder∣ful, Fish-ponds, and all other conveniencies for humane Support. These sort of Rocks the Natives call <HI>Amba;</HI> as <HI>Amba-Dorbo,</HI><NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">That is the Rock of the Hen, in the Map erroneously call'd <HI>Ambadora.</HI></NOTE> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This puts us in mind to describe that famous Rock in the Kingdom of <HI>Amhara,</HI> called <HI>Geshen,</HI> of which, and of the Moun∣tain <HI>Ambacel,</HI> we have already made mention, which we shall do in the words of <HI>Tellezius. In the Confines of</HI> Amhara, <HI>toward</HI> Shewa, <HI>stands</HI> Amba-Geshen: <HI>It is a Mountain almost impreg∣nable, every way steep, prodigiously high, and in the form of a Castle made all of Free-Stone: At the top it is about half a</HI> Portugal <HI>League in breadth, at the bottom near half a days Journey about: At first easie to be ascended, then steep and rugged, in so much, that the</HI> Abyssine <HI>Oxen, that otherwise will clamber like Goats, must be cran'd up and let down with Ropes.</HI></P>
<P>Formerly those miserable <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Princes were here cag'd up in wild places, in low Cottages, among Shrubs and wild Cedars, starv'd from all things else but Air and Earth; as if they, who were descended from a high Parentage, were to be confind in a high and lofty Exile. In <HI>Gojam,</HI> as<NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot"><HI>In</HI> Mulurgia sua Univers.

<P>Between these Mountains are immense Gulphs, and dread∣ful Profundities; which because the Sight cannot fathom, Fancy takes them for Abysses; whose bottoms <HI>Tellezius</HI> will have to be the Center of the Earth. Nor did <HI>Gregory</HI> de∣scribe

them otherwise, than as places most dreadful and for∣midable to the Eye.</P>
<P>Levels are very rare; the largest Plain is that in <HI>Dembea,</HI> near the Lake <HI>Tzanicus,</HI> about twenty <HI>Portugal</HI> Leagues in length, and four or five broad.</P>
<P>A Region so Mountainous, and so like to <HI>Switzerland,</HI> may be look'd upon justly by all people as a most rude and unhus∣banded Country; but they that consider the benefits which the <HI>Habessines</HI> receive thereby, will from the same reasons be drawn to an admiring Contemplation of Divine Provi∣dence: For that stupendious height of their Mountains con∣temns the scorching heat; which renders their Country the more inhabitable in those high places, where the people breath a more serene Air. In the next place, Heaven has thereby provided for their security, so many inaccessible Mountains, being like so many Castles, which afford them not only Habitation, but a safe defence against their Enemies. For had it not been for those Fortresses of Nature, they had been ruin'd long e're this, by the <HI>Adelenses</HI> and the <HI>Gallans.</HI> Moreover, thorough all those Mountains you shall find most pleasant Springs of Water, which are wanting in the Levels of the torrid Zone: The reason of which, we shall give you in another place.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of Metals and Minerals.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Abassia</HI> abounds in Metals and Minerals, especially Gold, which is found in the Sand of the Rivers; and in <HI>Damota</HI> and <HI>Enarrea</HI> upon the Superficies of the Earth. Silver they have not, and yet not without Lead. They neither know, nor care to know, what belongs to Metals. Salt plentifully digg'd out of the Earth. Gems they want. They more esteem black Lead, with which they colour their Eye-brows.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THat so many and so vast Mountains afford plenty of Metals and Minerals, the Fathers of the Society attest. And certainly, 'tis a thing easily credible, that that part of the Earth, lying under the fiercest and most maturing heat of the Sun, cannot be without Metals, and more especially Gold, which is found in the shallows of Ri∣vers,
<PB N="31" REF="21"/>
polish'd and pure in great quantities, about the big∣ness of a Tare or Vetch. Whence it is conjectur'd, that the Gold is brought to perfection in the neighbouring Moun∣tains, and carry'd away together with the Sand, by the for∣ces of the Stream. <HI>Pliny</HI> affirms that sort of Gold to be the finest and most perfect. <HI>Damota,</HI> but more especially <HI>Enar∣rea,</HI> enjoy this advantage, it being the chiefest Tribute which they pay. They are destitute of Silver; whether it be that Nature denies them that benefit, or that they know not how to dig it out and refine it: For they have Lead, which is said to be the Mother of Silver.</P>
<P>But they are altogether ignorant of the Minery Trade. For the digging of Wells, boaring of Mountains, suppor∣ting of Mines with massy Timber, hewing of Stones, or forcing Rocks with Gunpowder or Fire, to live in the dark, sometimes hours, sometimes days together, and to be half strangled with Smoke and Damps, to<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">Thus <HI>Pliny</HI> discourses concerning Minerals.</NOTE> search the Vains of the Earth, and examin the Secrets of Rocks, are things altogether unsuitable to the Genius of the <HI>Habessines.</HI> Ra∣ther they count it a piece of folly to pine after Minerals, and heap up Riches, to encourage the <HI>Turk</HI> to make War upon them. They think themselves far more safe in Iron, as being that with which Gold may be won: And for Iron, they have no occasion to delve for it, in regard they find it in great plenty upon the Superficies of the Earth, as <HI>P. Antonio Fer∣nandez</HI> testifies.</P>
<P>Moreover, in the Confines of <HI>Tigra</HI> and <HI>Angora,</HI> from a place call'd the <HI>Land of Salt,</HI> there<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Concerning such kind of Salt, see <HI>Pliny,</HI> l. <HI>31.</HI> c. <HI>7.</HI></NOTE> are natural Moun∣tains of Salt, from whence they supply themselves with in∣exhaustible quantities, cutting it out of the sides of the Moun∣tains in great pieces of a white and solid Substance. In the Mountain it is soft, and sliver'd off with little labour; but in the Air it hardens. From thence it is fetch'd by great num∣bers of Merchants, who conveigh it away in Caravans, which are call'd <HI>Cafila,</HI> and vended through all the neighbouring Nations and Countries where it is a scarce Commodity. <HI>Al∣phonsus Mendez</HI> the Patriarch, writes, That there is in another place a Mountain of Red Salt, very useful in Physic. So propitiously has Heaven compensated their want of Money
<PB N="32" REF="22"/>
with plenty of Salt; which by virtue whereof, as with ready Coyn, in other places they purchase other necessaries. Thus they abound in Salt, which the Life of Man cannot want; but they are destitute of other things that less conduce to the happiness of Human Being. Nor do they desire those things, of whose dazling Beauties and glittering Colours they are ignorant; I mean Gems and Jewels, rarely yet seen in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> whatever that same Trifler, <HI>Valentinian</HI> Ro∣mances. The Royal Diadem it self glitters only with coun∣terfeit Jewels, thinking it not worth their while to send their Salt or Gold to foreign and barbarous Nations to pur∣chase true ones; and admiring at our imprudence, for expen∣ding our Money so idly. They much more esteem those Minerals, that conduce to the health and preservation of the Body; chiefly among the rest <HI>Stibium,</HI> or Black Lead, which they in their Language call<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">A word well known in all the Eastern Languages, from the <HI>Hebrew</HI> word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which signifies <HI>Stibium</HI> from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Fucavit,</HI> or besmear'd with <HI>Fucus;</HI> and whence the <HI>Greek</HI> word <HI>Collyrium,</HI> as it were <HI>Cohollyrium,</HI> seems deriv'd.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Many Rivers there more precious than Metals. The Fountains originally from Rain-water. An Encomium of <HI>Nilus:</HI> In Scripture it is call'd, The River <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and <HI>Schichor,</HI> or <HI>Niger:</HI> By some of the ancients <HI>Astapus,</HI> and <HI>Astaboras:</HI> In the <HI>Amharic</HI> Dialect call'd <HI>Abawi,</HI> or the <HI>Patent of Rivers;</HI> it flows not in <HI>Paradise,</HI> as some of the Fathers thought. Admiration caus'd the desire of knowing its Original, that the Ancients plac'd in the Mountains of the Moon. The <HI>Portugals</HI> discover'd the true Fountains; their description from <HI>Peter Pays,</HI> not different from <HI>Gregories:</HI> It rises in <HI>Sicut;</HI> it has five Heads. It mixes with the Lake in <HI>Dembea.</HI> It passes by the principal Kingdoms of <HI>Habassia,</HI> encircles <HI>Gojam,</HI> runs through <HI>Egypt,</HI> and so into the Sea; <HI>Gregories</HI> Ethiopic Description.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BUT much more excelling, and far more precious Gifts of Nature than those of Metals, flow from the Mountains of <HI>Habessinia,</HI> that is to say, several remarkable Rivers more profitable to the Natives, and the neighbouring Nations, than Gold it self, so much the Sub∣ject of human Avarice. For the Rain-water soaking through the pores of the Earth, and the clefts of the Rocks, is re∣ceiv'd, and, as it were, cistern'd up in the hidden Caverns of the Mountains, where, after it has pass'd through many secret conveyances of Nature, at length it meets with some hollow place, and breaks forth. Sometimes oppress'd by its own weight, it reascends, and seeks for passage at the tops of the Mountains themselves; which is the reason, that in Countries where there is little or no Rain, there are few or no Fountains; but where there are frequent Rains, the Ri¦vers are large and swelling: The Effect demonstrating the

quaggy and mershy; nevertheless the Water does not spring forth there, but issues from the foot of the Mountain. About a Musquet Shot from thence, toward the East, the River begins to flow; then winding to the North, about the fourth part of a League, it receives another River; a little farther, two more flowing from the East fall into it; and soon after, it enlarges it self with the addition of several other Streams. About a days journey farther, by the Relation of the same</HI> Peter, <HI>it swallows up the River</HI> Jema; <HI>then winding Westward some twenty Leagues, it turns again to the East, and plunges it self into a vast Lake.</HI> This Relation differs not from what <HI>Gregory</HI> has discoursed to me, only he particulariz'd the names of the Countries, that perhaps were the more special Denominations of those places, of which <HI>Sabala</HI> was the more general Name. For as he related to me, the Spring-head of <HI>Nile</HI> is in a certain Land call'd <HI>Secut,</HI> upon the top of <HI>Dengla,</HI> which perhaps is the name of a Mountain. He also affirm'd, that it had five Spring-heads, reckoning in the Heads of other Rivers, which have no particular name, and are therefore taken for the <HI>Nile.</HI> But it passes through the Lake <HI>Tzanicum,</HI> preserving the colour of its own Wa∣ters, like the <HI>Rhosne</HI> running through the Lake <HI>Lemann,</HI> and the <HI>Rhine</HI> through <HI>Acronius,</HI> or the Lake <HI>De Zell.</HI> Then winding to the South, it washes on the left hand the princi∣pal Kingdoms of <HI>Habessinia, Bagemdra, Amhara, Waleka, Shewa, Damota,</HI> and takes along the Rivers of those Coun∣tries <HI>Bashlo, Tzohha, Kecem, Jema, Roma,</HI> and <HI>Wancit.</HI> Then on the right hand embracing <HI>Gojam,</HI> its Native Country, almost like a Circle, and swell'd with the Rivers of that Region, <HI>Maga, Abaja, Aswari, Temci, Gult,</HI> and <HI>Tzul,</HI> it turns again to the West, as it were bidding farewel to its Foun∣tains, and with a prodigious mass of ramass'd Rivers, lea∣ving <HI>Habessinia</HI> upon the right hand, rolls to the North through several thirsty Nations, and sandy Deserts, to en∣fertile <HI>Egypt</HI> with its Inundations, and there makes its way through several mouths into the Sea.

<P><HI>The Course of</HI> Nile <HI>is like a Circle; it encompasses</HI> Gojam, <HI>but so, that it never returns back to its Head, making directly to</HI> Sennar. <HI>And therefore</HI> Gojam <HI>lies always upon the right hand of</HI> Nile; <HI>but all the other Kingdoms of</HI> Ethiopia, <HI>as well those that

lye near, as those at a distance, remain still upon the left. As it flows along, it takes in all the Rivers great and small with several Torrents, as well Foreign as</HI> Habessinian, <HI>which by that general Tribute, acknowledge him their King; who having thus muster'd together all the Waters of</HI> Ethiopia, <HI>jocundly takes his leave, and proceeds on his Journey, like a</HI> Hero, <HI>according to the Command of his Creator, to drench the Fields of thirsty</HI> Egypt, <HI>and quench the drowth of Thousands.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Spring-head of this famous River first shews it self in a certain Land, which is called</HI> Secut, <HI>upon the top of</HI> Dengla, <HI>near</HI> Gojam, <HI>West of</HI> Bagemdra, Dara, <HI>the Lake</HI> Tzana, <HI>and</HI> Bada: <HI>Rising thus, it hastens with a direct course Eastward, and so enters the Lake of</HI> Dara <HI>and</HI> Bed, <HI>as it were swimming over it. Passing from thence, it flows between</HI> Gojam <HI>and</HI> Bagemdra; <HI>but leaving them upon the right and left, speeds directly toward</HI> Amhara. <HI>Ha∣ving touch'd the Confines of</HI> Amhara, <HI>he turns his Face toward the West, and girdles</HI> Gojam <HI>like a Circle, but so, that</HI> Gojam <HI>lies always upon the right hand of it. Having past the Limits of</HI> Am∣hara, <HI>it washes the Confines of</HI> Walaka, <HI>and so on to the extream bounds of</HI> Mugara <HI>and</HI> Shewa. <HI>Then it slides between</HI> Bizama <HI>and</HI> Gonga, <HI>and descends into the Country of the</HI> Shankelites. <HI>Whence he winds to the right hand, and leaves by degrees the Western Clime upon the left hand, to visit the Kingdom of</HI> Sennar. <HI>But before he get thither, he meets with two great Rivers that plunge themselves into his Streams, coming from the East; of which one is call'd</HI> Tacazè, <HI>that falls out of</HI> Tigra, <HI>and the other</HI> Guangue, <HI>that descends from</HI> Dembea. <HI>After he has taken a view of the Kingdom of</HI> Sennar, <HI>away he travels to the Country of</HI> Dengula, <HI>and so comes to the Kingdom of</HI> Nubia, <HI>and thence turns to the right hand, in order to his intended Voyage for</HI> Alexandria, <HI>and comes to a certain Country which is call'd</HI> Abrim, <HI>where the Stream is unna∣vigable by reason of the Cliffs and Rocks; after which, he enters</HI> Egypt. Sennar <HI>and</HI> Nubia <HI>are seated upon the shore of</HI> Nile, <HI>to∣ward the West, so that they may drink of his Waters; besides, that he guards their Eastern Limits, as far as he approaches near them. But our People and Travellers from</HI> Sennar, <HI>after they have cross'd</HI> Nu∣bia, <HI>quit the River</HI> Nile, <HI>leaving it upon the right hand toward the East, and ride through a Desert of</HI> 15 <HI>days journey upon Camels, where neither Tree nor Water, but only Sand is to be seen; but then they meet with it again in the Country of</HI> Riffe, <HI>which is the</HI> Upper Egypt, <HI>where they either take Boat, or travel a foot in Company with the Stream.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="25"/>But as to what he wrote concerning the flowing of great and small Rivers into <HI>Nile,</HI> he explains himself in these words.</P>
<P><HI>All great Rivers and smaller Torrents flow into</HI> Nile, <HI>excepting only two: The one is call'd</HI> Hanazo, <HI>which rises in</HI> Hangota; <HI>and the other</HI> Hawash, <HI>which runs near</HI> Dawara <HI>and</HI> Fatagara.</P>
<P>But as if this had not been enough, he goes on with a far∣ther Explanation in another Epistle, as follows.</P>
<P><HI>But whereas I told you in a Description of</HI> Nile, <HI>that all the Ri∣vers of</HI> Ethiopia <HI>flow'd into it except two, I am not to be understood, as if I spoke of all</HI> Ethiopia. <HI>For those Rivers that are upon the Borders of the Circuit of</HI> Ethiopia, <HI>which are near the Ocean, they fall into the Sea, every one in their distinct Regions. Now the Coun∣tries adjoyning to the Ocean, are these;</HI> Canbat, Guraghè, Ena∣ria, Zandera, Wed, Waci, Gaci, <HI>and some others.</HI></P>
<P>The Native Country of <HI>Nile</HI> being thus discover'd, the cause of his Inundation is manifest: For most of the Coun∣tries under the <HI>Torrid Zone,</HI> when the Sun returns into the Winter Signs, are wash'd, as we have said, with immode∣rate Showers. So that the prodigious mass of Waters that randevouzes from all parts, cannot be contain'd within his Channel, and therefore when it comes into the Levels of <HI>Egypt,</HI> it presently disburthens it self. Those Northern Winds, from their Anniversary Breezes, call'd <HI>Etesiae,</HI> add little to the Increase. Tho some have written, That their for∣cing the Sea against the Mouths of the River, drives back the Waters of <HI>Nile,</HI> and augments the cause of the Deluge. A thing not likely, in regard they are the most temperate of all the Winds, and blow only in the day-time. Thus far indeed they may prevail, as they blow slacker or stronger, to render the Increase somewhat the more unequal, and that is all. Vainly therefore did many believe, that the Snow that melted from the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Mountains, delug'd into the River <HI>Nilus;</HI> for them, that profound Tracer of Nature, <HI>Seneca,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Quest. natu∣ral, l. <HI>4.</HI> c. <HI>2.</HI></NOTE> has solidly refuted. Which makes it a wonder that <HI>Paulus Jovius</HI> should report the same, as what he had ga∣ther'd from the certain Conjectures of the <HI>Habessines;</HI> who at another time speaks of the very same thing, <HI>as a great Secret of Nature,</HI> which no Man had ever div'd into; nay, he reproves it for weakness, with an ostentatious Wit to be over diligently curious in the search of such matters.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="25"/>Yet tho the Fountains of <HI>Nile</HI> are known, the course of it is not so well discover'd to the <HI>Habessines</HI> themselves after it has left them. But the ancient and constant report is, that it does not fall<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jul. Solin in Polyhist.</HI> c. <HI>43.</HI> The <HI>Ethiopians</HI> and <HI>Atlantic</HI> Nations are divided by the River <HI>Niger,</HI> which is believ'd to be a part of <HI>Nilus.</HI></NOTE> entire into <HI>Egypt,</HI> but that it is divided into two Channels, and that the right Channel runs to the North, as is well known; but that the left runs Westward, and keeping a long course, divides the Country of the <HI>Nigrites,</HI> 'till it fall into the Ocean. This the ancient <HI>Egyptian</HI> Priests were not ignorant of; for <HI>Herodotus,</HI> the foremost in Hi∣story, after he has discours'd concerning the Springs of <HI>Nile,</HI> learnedly reports, That he had heard from an Auditor of the Money sacred to <HI>Minerva,</HI> That half of the Water of <HI>Nile</HI> flow'd Northward into <HI>Egypt,</HI> the other half Southward toward <HI>Ethiopia:</HI> Which none of our Geographers either observ'd or mended.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Clim.</HI> 1. <HI>Part.</HI> 4.</NOTE> But the <HI>Nubian</HI> Geographer puts me quite out of doubt, when he writes,</P>
<P><HI>And in this part of</HI> Ethiopia <HI>are the two</HI> Niles <HI>parted;</HI> that is, <HI>Nilus</HI> which waters out Country of <HI>Nubia,</HI> directs his Course from South to North, and most of the Cities of <HI>Egypt</HI> are seated on each side of his Banks, and in his Islands. The other part of <HI>Nile</HI> flows from the East toward the West, and upon this part of <HI>Nile</HI> lies the whole Country of the <HI>Nigrites,</HI> or at least the greater part of it.</P>
<P>A little after he adds concerning a certain Mountain; <HI>And near to that, one of the Arms of</HI> Nile <HI>turns off, and flows to the West:</HI> And this is the <HI>Nile</HI> that belongs to the Country of the <HI>Nigrites,</HI> many of their Provinces lying upon it. But near the Eastern side of the Mountain, the other Arm turns off, waters the Country of <HI>Nubia,</HI> and the Land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and is divided in the <HI>Lower Egypt</HI> into four parts, of which three fall into the <HI>Syrian</HI> Sea, and the other empties it self in a Salt Lake which is near to <HI>Alexandria</HI> The words are every way most clear; and very probable it is, That the separation of the two <HI>Niles</HI> might be caus'd by the resistance of some rocky Mountain that constrain'd the two Streams to part, since they could not undermine it. To which, the words of <HI>Leo Africanus</HI> relate; <HI>The Region of the</HI> Nigrites,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In Descript. <HI>Afric.</HI> l. <HI>1.</HI> c. <HI>7.</HI></NOTE> <HI>through which</HI> Nilus <HI>is said to flow:</HI> Which seem to intimate, that he had heard something by report concerning this same
<PB N="40" REF="26"/>
left Channel. Nor am I a little confirm'd by the judgment of <HI>Gregory,</HI> which he expressed to me by writing, in these words.</P>
<P><HI>But as to what is reported, that</HI> Nile <HI>does not flow altogether and entirely into the Land of</HI> Egypt, <HI>but that it is divided another way. This all those persons of whom I have enquir'd, averr to me to be truth. This I also encline to believe, for should it descend en∣tirely thither in the Winter time, the</HI> Egyptians <HI>could never be safe in their Houses.</HI> But as to what concerns its separation, they say, That Parting happens after the River has pass'd by <HI>Sen∣nar</HI> in the Country of <HI>Dengula,</HI> before it arrives in <HI>Nubia:</HI> However, they say, That the greatest mass of Water flows into <HI>Egypt,</HI> and that the separated part runs directly to the western Ocean; yet so, that it comes not into <HI>Barbary,</HI> but descends toward the Country of <HI>Elwah,</HI> and so throws it self into the western Ocean.</P>
<P>Now that the River <HI>Niger</HI> should be the left Channel of <HI>Nile,</HI> is most probable from hence, for that as <HI>Pliny</HI> writes, and Experience confirms,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>l.</HI> 5. <HI>c.</HI> 8.</NOTE> it <HI>partakes of the same Conditions</HI> with it, agrees in colour and tast of the Water, it produces the same sort of Reed, the same sort of Papyr, and the same sort of Animals; and lastly, encreases and overflows at the same Seasons. Neither does the Name it self contradict the Conjecture, in regard that, as we have said, <HI>Nilus</HI> it self is by the <HI>Hebrews</HI> and <HI>Greeks</HI> call'd <HI>Niger.</HI> But as to what the <HI>Egyptian</HI> related to <HI>Herodotus,</HI> That the left Channel flow'd toward the South, that perhaps might be for such a certain distance of Land, not but that afterwards it might vary its Course, and wind toward the West. Which opinion, after I had communicated to the most famous <HI>Bochart,</HI> so highly skill'd both in the ancient and modern Geography, and the best Judge of these matters, he wrote me in answer, <HI>Il est tres vray, que le Niger est une partie du Nile; Most certain it is, that</HI> Niger <HI>is a part of</HI> Nile.</P>
<P>Now follows a Question, no less admirable than it is of moment; <HI>Whether it be in the power of the</HI> Abyssine <HI>Kings so to divert the Court of</HI> Nile, <HI>that it should not overflow</HI> Egypt? Many Writers assert the Affirmative, trusting partly to Fame, and partly to a Relation, which we shall produce out of <HI>George Elmacine;</HI> adding, That the <HI>Turks</HI> therefore pay a Tribute to the <HI>Abessines.</HI> Others also upon the sight of the Geographi∣cal Map, believe it a thing easie to be accomplish'd, to turn

the Stream of <HI>Nilus</HI> into the <HI>Red-Sea;</HI> which <HI>Albuquerquez,</HI> that magnanimous <HI>Portugueze,</HI> Viceroy in <HI>India,</HI> was contri∣ving to do.

Of the same opinion are<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot"><HI>In Orbe imperante. tit.</HI> Africa. Period 2.

<P><Q REND="margQuotes">In those days, that is, in the days of <HI>Michael</HI> the Patriarch, <HI>Nilus</HI> fail'd extreamly; <HI>Mustansir</HI> therefore, a <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> Prince of <HI>Egypt,</HI> sent him to the Country of the <HI>Habessines,</HI> with costly Gifts, and other things of high value. Where∣upon the King of the Country came forth to meet him, whom the Patriarch reverenc'd publicly. After that, the King demanded of him the cause of his coming. Then the Patriarch made known to the King, how that the Wa∣ters of <HI>Nile</HI> fail'd in <HI>Egypt,</HI> to the unspeakable detriment of the Land and Inhabitants. Thereupon, in favour of the Patriarch, the King commanded the Channel to be open'd, through which the Water ran into <HI>Egypt,</HI> which was then stopp'd up. Which being done, <HI>Nilus</HI> encreas'd three yards in one night, and the River was so fill'd, that the Fields of <HI>Egypt</HI> were water'd and sown. So that the Patri∣arch return'd with great Honour into <HI>Egypt.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I could wish to hear the opinions of those that deny this place. The words are clear of themselves, that the King commanded the Channel that was stopp'd to be open'd. The Historian himself is accounted a credible Author, bred and born in <HI>Egypt,</HI> as also Secretary to the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Princes of that Country. So that he could not possibly be ignorant of such an accident; and besides, he wrote his History above a hundred and twenty years after the thing happen'd: And therefore had it been an untruth, he durst not have mention'd it for fear of being contradicted, which he might easily have been. But it may be objected, That the Historian does not
<PB N="42" REF="27"/>
mention by whom the Channel was obstructed, or whether it happen'd, as many times it does, naturally, when the course of a Stream is damm'd up by trunks of Trees, Mud and Stones driven by force, and heap'd together in the nar∣row passages of the Water. But this Objection does not re∣solve the doubt; for such remarkable stops rarely or never happen in such large or violent Rivers. Or if Nature could effect so much, what might not be accomplish'd by Art? <HI>Athanasius Kircher,</HI> a person not only generally vers'd in the Affair of <HI>Egypt,</HI> but more particularly in what related to the River <HI>Nile,</HI> in his Catalogue of the Patriarchs of <HI>Egypt,</HI> re∣lates, That one<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">In Supplement. Prod. and Lexic. Capt. <HI>p. 524. c. 2.</HI> This <HI>Michael</HI> was the <HI>68th</HI> Patriarch of the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> and dy'd about the year <HI>1110.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Michael</HI> was sent into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> for the resto∣ring of <HI>Nile</HI> to its Channel, from whence the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> had directed the Course of its Waters; tho it be the fault of that learned Man to write much, rather than accurately; nor does he always commend his Authors. The Question being put to <HI>Gregory,</HI> he did not remember the Story of <HI>Michael,</HI> but that he had heard from persons of great Credit, That not far from the Cataracts of <HI>Nile,</HI> all the Land toward the East lies level; and unless it were for one Mountain that stands in the way, <HI>Nile</HI> would rather flow that way, than into <HI>Egypt</HI> or the Northern Sea. So that if that Mountain were digg'd through, a thing to be done with pains and difficulty, the Course of the River might be turn'd and carry'd into the <HI>Red-Sea;</HI> which is well known to the <HI>Turks,</HI> and many of the <HI>Portugals:</HI> And for this reason have the Emperours of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> obtain'd those advantagious Conditions from the <HI>Sa∣racens.</HI> Nay, it is said, That once one of the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Em∣perours had an intention to have done it, and had comman∣ded his Subjects to undertake the Work, but that he was prevail'd upon to desist at the entreaty of the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Christians.</P>
<P>I must confess, this thing has very much perplex'd my thoughts; nor are the Reasons that are brought against it to be contemn'd: For either to raise a Mole or Dam of Stones, and then to remove it again, are things requiring so much toyl and labour, that the Task does no way agree with the nature of the <HI>Abessines.</HI> And it seems somewhat unlikely, that so vast a River, so long accustom'd to a declining and
<PB N="43" REF="27"/>
headlong Course, should be diverted and compell'd to change its Channel. I consider'd also with my self, that if the King of <HI>Habessinia</HI> had the River <HI>Nile</HI> so much in his Power, he might have all <HI>Egypt</HI> easily at his Devotion, and that the <HI>Turk</HI> could deny him nothing whatever he demanded. Nor would he ever suffer the Christians of his own Religion, and the Patriarch, who is the Head of his Church, to groan under such a miserable Bondage. Lastly, I did not a little wonder, that the Jesuits did not insinuate it into the heads of the <HI>Abessines</HI> to make use of that Power which Nature had put into their hands, and that they did not use Threats, rather than Intreaties and Bribes to obtain those convenien∣cies which they enjoy by the favour of the <HI>Turkish Basha,</HI> who commands the Ports of the <HI>Red-Sea.</HI> But all things consider'd, and rejecting the History of <HI>Elmacine,</HI> we may answer <HI>Tellez</HI> from the Relation of <HI>Gregory,</HI> which is, That a new Channel may be carry'd on, not from those parts of <HI>Abessinia,</HI> which lie upon the <HI>Nile,</HI> and are so many Leagues distant from the Sea; but from that part which is near the Cataracts, and formerly perhaps belong'd to <HI>Nubia.</HI> My first Opinion was, That the Channel of <HI>Nile</HI> could no where be so easily alter'd as in that place where it divides it self into two Channels, for that there, by the direction of Nature her self, it seem'd, that the whole might be more easily turn'd another way, where a part turns naturally without compul∣sion. For tho other Rivers empty themselves into <HI>Nile</HI> be∣yond this separation, and flow into <HI>Egypt,</HI> yet are they not enough to make the Inundation so great as necessity requires; which would not only be the ruin of <HI>Egypt,</HI> but a great di∣minution of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Power. But however it be, this I believe to be certain, That the King of <HI>Habessinia</HI> is now no more Lord of those places where the River <HI>Nile</HI> ever was, or ever can be diverted from <HI>Nile;</HI> nor are the Princes of those places now at his Devotion; neither are they indeed <HI>Christians,</HI> but unhappily revolted to <HI>Paganism.</HI> So that what∣ever formerly might have been done, cannot now be brought to pass; not that the nature of the place obstructs the design, but that the Prince of the Country wants Power, or else has no inclination to the Project. Otherwise I should not think it either absurd or improbable, that some Rivers that make their way through the high Fields of <HI>Habessinia,</HI> might be convey'd another way by the descents of the Hill, through
<PB N="44" REF="28"/>
the sandy Levels that lye below to a vast diminution of the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Stream, provided that skilful Artists were employ'd to survey the declivities of the places, and the places most proper to carry off the Water. For though it be a difficult thing to alter the Course and Limits of Rivers, which Na∣ture has settl'd, yet Examples are not wanting. We read in <HI>Herodotus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>L.</HI> 1. <HI>call'd</HI> Clio.</NOTE> That <HI>Nitocres</HI> King of the <HI>Babylonians</HI> turn'd the Course of <HI>Euphratis</HI> several ways, by sinking several new Cuts and Dikes. And <HI>Cyrus</HI> King of the <HI>Persians,</HI> being in wroth with the River <HI>Gyndes,</HI> by reason of one of the Sacred white Horses drown'd therein, divided it into a hun∣dred and sixty small Streams, the Summer's labour of his whole Army.</P>
<P>But there are other remarkable Rivers that owe for their Springs to <HI>Habessinia</HI> besides <HI>Nilus.</HI> Of these the most fa∣mous is <HI>Tacazè,</HI> which rising in <HI>Angota,</HI> not far from <HI>Ba∣gemdra,</HI> out of the Mountain <HI>Ahguaga,</HI> divides <HI>Tigra</HI> and <HI>Wal∣kajit,</HI> and so passing through the <HI>Ethiopian Nomades,</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Dequin,</HI> at length falls into <HI>Nile. Melegi,</HI> accor∣ding to <HI>Tellez,</HI> takes its rise in <HI>Damota,</HI> and falls into <HI>Nile</HI> westward of <HI>Habessinia.</HI> As for the other Rivers, sufficiently large, which <HI>Nilus</HI> receives from all the Kingdoms of <HI>Ha∣bassia,</HI> we have set them down in our Chorographical Table, and therefore forbear to name them here.</P>
<P>All these Rivers, as well as <HI>Nile,</HI> in the Winter time swell to that height, as not to be contain'd within their own Banks.</P>
<P>Nor must we omit the admirable nature of two more Rivers, of which the one call'd <HI>Hawash,</HI> rising in the Con∣fines of <HI>Shewa</HI> and <HI>Wed,</HI> hastens into the Kingdom of <HI>Adel,</HI> to quench the drought of those thirsty Soyls. Nor are the Inhabitants wanting to themselves; they gladly go to meet their welcom Guest, and bring it in several large Cuts to water their Grounds. And thus being frequently intercepted, and wasted by degrees, as if asham'd to carry a small portion of Water to the Sea, it plunges it self into the Sand.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of the Fertility of the Soyl in general, and of the Vegetables and Plants in particular.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>In <HI>Habessinia,</HI> sometimes two, sometimes three Harvests. <HI>Tef,</HI> a sort of Corn unknown to us. They want Rice; despise Oats; feed their Horses with Barley; Grass always; no Hay; sundry sorts of Herbs. <HI>Amad∣magda</HI> cures broken Bones. <HI>Assazoi</HI> intoxicates Serpents. The an∣cient <HI>Psylli</HI> safe by the vertue of this Herb. Oyl of Saffron: They want Hops. Grapes they have, but no Wine. They abound in Sugar; want Spices. The <HI>Indian</HI> Fig, <HI>Manz;</HI> perhaps the <HI>Dudaim</HI> of the <HI>Hebrews.</HI> No Pears nor Apples. Citrons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they have. Their Trees. Ensete, a Pot-herb. Another Tree that kills Worms in Children.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE fertility of the Soyl in <HI>Habessinia</HI> is to be ad∣mir'd; for the Land where it admits of Tillage, abounds in all sorts of Fruits. The long Summers affording that extraordinary plenty, that in the same place you shall find Seed-time and Harvest; which is in some pla∣ces double, in other places threefold. For Grain and Pulse the <HI>Habessines</HI> have not only those known to us, as Wheat, Barley, Millet, and the like; but also another sort unknown to us, which they call <HI>Tef,</HI> which makes very good Bread: The Seed of it is extreamly small, less than Pepper, but longer. Rye they have none: Yet when <HI>Gregory</HI> smelt to a Rye Loaf, he said, It was the true <HI>Tef,</HI> and that it had the true smell of <HI>Tef.</HI> He look'd upon Oats as not worth sow∣ing, saying, It was no better esteem'd than Cockle in their Country: For that Barley or Grass only was the general Food of their Horses. They neither sow nor mow, for the sake of their Cattel; Grass abounding in the more tempe∣rate places; by reason of the perpetual heat, and the moi∣sture continually distilling from the Mountains: For the solid Stones not admitting the Rain, the Water falls off from them, and spreading under the fertile Turf, wonderfully recreates and enlivens the growing Plants. For which reason, the Fields are always pleasing and verdant, always smiling with a flowry Grace. From whence an extraordinary superfluity of Honey, the Trees being so plentifully fed. In the midst

of such abundance, the <HI>Habessines</HI> neither lay up, nor pro∣vide against the years ensuing, whether trusting to their Plenty, or destitute of Store-houses. They never stack their Hay; tho for the sake of the Locusts it many times falls out to be very necessary. For that same pestilent Vermin devou∣ring Corn and Grass, occasions frequent Famines, destructive to Man and Beast. <HI>Grtgory,</HI> observing afar off certain Cart∣loads of Hay, compar'd them to Elephants at a distance.</P>
<P>Herbs of all sorts grow in this Country, not only the fra∣grant and medicinal Plants of <HI>Europe,</HI> but some more peculi∣ar, and of admirable vertue. The <HI>Amadmagda</HI> cures broken and dis-joynted Bones, contrary to the <HI>Ossifraga</HI> of <HI>Norway,</HI> which snaps the Bones of Cattel that tread upon it. The Herb <HI>Assazoe</HI> is of that rare vertue against the biting of <HI>Asps,</HI> that the most hurtful Serpents touch'd with this Herb, are streight intoxicated, and lye for dead. He that eats of the Root of this Herb, may walk without danger in the midst of Adders and Water-Snakes, and for many years shall be free from the fear of them: In so much, that some of the <HI>Habessines</HI> have been seen, after they have eaten of this Root, to han∣dle the most venomous Snakes like Eels, twist 'em about their Necks; and then to kill 'em, when they had done shewing tricks with 'em. So Providence ordering the most efficacious Remedies where the Poysons are mos pernicious. Which makes me believe that it was not a thing peculiar, or a particular faculty in the <HI>Psylli,</HI> an ancient People of <HI>Africa,</HI> that they could cure the biting of Serpents, but got by the use of this Herb; only they kept the thing secret to render themselves the more admired. For they made a Trade of it, by carrying Venemous Animals about the World without danger, for the sight whereof, the more curious gave them Money. <HI>Garden Saffron,</HI> which the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> call <HI>Denguelet,</HI> is frequent in <HI>Habesinia;</HI> the Seed of it <HI>Gregory</HI> shewed me for a great Rarity: and cryed up the Oyl which was to be pressed out of it, against the <HI>Hypocondriacal Evil,</HI> and <HI>Obstructi∣ons of the Spleen.</HI> They want Hopps, and boyl their Drink with∣out it. And therefore <HI>Gregory</HI> finding, that it was the vertue of the Hopps, which kept our Drink so long, took great care to carry some of the Seed along with him into his own Coun∣try. Their Vine and Grapes are most Transcendant, but they never make any Wines, whether out of ignorance, or because the Grapes being ripen'd in Summer, the excessive
<PB N="50" REF="33"/>
heat hastens the fermentation and sowers the Liquor before the Lee be setled. They abound in Sugar, but as for Pepper, Ginger, and other such like Spices they have none; rather out of carelesness to Plant, as I believe, than through the fault of the Soyl; which considering the variety of the Air, and the continual heat of some Places, seems most proper for such a sort of Husbandrie. The Indian Figg also, which the <HI>A∣rabians</HI> call <HI>Muz</HI> or <HI>Mauz,</HI> grows plentifully here, a most Ex∣cellent Fruit it is; and you shall have fifty Figgs, about the bigness and shape of a Cucumber hanging upon one stalk, of a most delicious odour and taste. They are ripe in <HI>June,</HI> as I learnt from the Itinerary of Prince <HI>Radzevile,</HI> who had seen some of them near <HI>Damascus,</HI> where they are rare; for they re∣quire a hotter Climate. Which Circumstances make me be∣lieve, that this same Fruit may be the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Dudaim</HI> mention'd in <HI>Genesis,</HI> which occasion'd so much discontent between the two Wives of <HI>Jacob.</HI> Soon after I observ'd that many others, Learned Men, lighted upon the same Conjecture, though they do not give their Reasons. For in my Opinion, it should be some rare and pleasant Fruit, that should move the Boy to gather it; yet not so much a Boy neither, as to think it worth his while to carry home a stinking <HI>Mandrake,</HI> which could be a fruit little worth contending for. Besides, <HI>Rachel</HI> might have sent her Servant as well to have gathered Amiable Flowers, (as some render the Word) that is to say, Lillies, Violets, or the like. And besides the <HI>Hebrew</HI> word seems to confirm this Opinion: as being in the <HI>dual</HI> Num∣ber, and seeming to infer a relation of more than one Fruit to one and the same Stalk.</P>
<P>Apples and Pears, such as grow in our Climates, they have none. For at what time they Ripen with us, Storms and Tempests rage in <HI>Habessinia.</HI> For the Trees, as I have heard the Habessines acknowledge, observe our Seasons, sprout forth and shed their Leaves in the same Month with ours; but with the Plants it is otherwise, which Flower there in our Winter. However, they have Pome-Citrons, Abricots, Peaches, and Pomegranates, rip'ned to their full and due Perfection. <HI>Gregory</HI> admired to behold our Woods of tall Firrs, some seventy, some eighty Foot high; and often call'd them <HI>Arbores benedictas,</HI> blessed Trees: especially, when he heard how useful they were towards the building of Ships and Houses. However we do not find but that <HI>Ethiopia</HI> has
<PB N="51" REF="33"/>
its share of tall Trees, as well as other Countries. But the Tree which goes by the Name of <HI>Ensete,</HI> is not to be pass'd over without Admiration; being like that which bears the Indian Figg, two fathoms in thickness. For being half cut down, it renews again by means of innumerable shouts that spring again from the remaining Trunk, all which is fit to be eaten; so that there is no need that the Tree should bear any other Fruit, it being all Pot-herb of it self. For being slic'd and boyl'd it asswages the Thirst of the common sort of People, who bruise the Leaves and boyl them with Meal, and then eat the Composition instead of a Hastie-pudding. There is another Tree which <HI>Godignus</HI> praises, most excellent against the Worms in the Belly: a Distem∣per frequent among the <HI>Abessines,</HI> by reason of their fee∣ding upon Raw Flesh. For remedy whereof the <HI>Habessi∣nes</HI> Purge themselves once a Moneth with the Fruit of this Tree, which causes them to Void all their Worms.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BY reason of the Plenty of Grass, and the perpetual heat of the Country, 'tis not to be wondred at, that the Beasts should be larger and fuller grown in those Countries than in other Regions.

I rather believe, should be taken for those of <HI>Abissinia.</HI> For that <HI>Habessinia</HI> was by many of the Ancients compre∣hended under the name of <HI>India.</HI> And that Oxen so large should wear vast Horns, four Foot broad, is as probable al∣together, as <HI>Pliny</HI> relates in the same place.</P>
<P><HI>Africa</HI> was formerly Famous for the Heards and Droves of Cattle fed therein; and at this time there are some Na∣tions that support themselves meerly by Grazing: of this sort are the <HI>Bektences,</HI> not far from <HI>Suaquena,</HI> who in the <HI>Sum∣mer</HI> Inhabit the Mountains; in the <HI>Winter</HI> spread themselves upon the Plains, changing their Seats as the Tempestuous Seasons varie, and settling where they find most Fodder for their Cattel.</P>
<P>Their Horses are courageous and strong; but they never make use of them, unless it be in Battel, or when they run Races; so that they never take care to shooe them: for if at any time they cannot avoid passing through Stony and Rocky passages, they lead their Horses, riding them∣selves upon Mules. They are of various Colours, as our Horses are; bright Bay, Sorrel, cole Black, Roan, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but most commonly Black. <HI>Elmacin</HI> reports, That <HI>Cyrtacus</HI> King of <HI>Nubia</HI> brought into <HI>Aegypt</HI> an Army of a Hundred thou∣sand <HI>Blacks,</HI> all mounted upon Black Horses. <HI>Gregory</HI> piti∣ed our Horses, when he saw them drawing great Carts; admiring at the Patience of the Beasts: and our Cruelty, in putting so Noble and Warlike a Creature to such base and servile Exercises. And therefore the <HI>Abissines</HI> make more frequent use of Mules, as well to carry their burthens, as when they travel long Journeys; for no sort of Beast treads more safely in their rugged ways: and for the greater ease of the Rider, they teach them sometimes to Amble. It was very troublesome to <HI>Gregory</HI> when he travell'd, to ride a Horse∣back; especially, if the Horse either Trotted or Gallopp'd: a vexation which he frequently complained of.</P>
<P>Camels are never used but in the plain Country, for they tread upon the Sand though scalding hot, without any harm to their Feet; but in Mountainous and Rocky ways, they are altogether useless.</P>
<P>That same sort of Sheep also, so much admired and so well known, both in the <HI>East,</HI> and in <HI>Africa,</HI> is here very common; the Tayls of which are so fat and ponderous, that the least of them weigh Ten and Twelve, the biggest of
<PB N="54" REF="37"/>
them sometimes above forty Pound, so that the Owners are forc'd to tye a little Cart behind them, wherein they put the Tayl of the Sheep, as well for the convenience of Carriage and to ease the poor Creature, as to preserve the Wooll from durt and nastiness, and being torn among bushes and stones. And it is a probable conjecture that <HI>Exodus</HI> speaks of this sort of <HI>Ram,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Exod.</HI> 29.22</NOTE> where <HI>Moses</HI> commands, among the rest of the fat parts of the <HI>Ram of Impletions</HI> that were to be cut off and burnt, the Tayl of the <HI>Ram <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Aljah</HI> to be cut off for the same purpose; For that the Word <HI>Aljah</HI> seems to import as much, which signi∣fies only the Tayl of a fat <HI>Ram,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <HI>Nahab</HI> being the ge∣neral word for the Tayl of all other Beasts; among which, the leaner sort of Sheep like ours are included.<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Bochart <HI>in</HI> Hierozoico. <HI>L.</HI> 2, <HI>c.</HI> 45. <HI>p.</HI> 494.</NOTE> As for other tame Beasts, they have the very same as are to be seen common in these parts of the World.</P>
<P>But as for Wild Beasts, <HI>Abissinia</HI> breeds more, and more bulkie than any other Region: of which, we shall give a short account, beginning from those which appear most Monstrous in their Creation. In the first place <HI>Elephants,</HI> conspicuous for bulk of Body and Docility, heard together in the Plain and Woody places in great Numbers. <HI>H. Lo∣dowic Azevedez</HI> saw in <HI>Tigra</HI> a hundred of them together differing in Bigness; and he attests, that as great a Num∣ber went but a little before them.<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">This number may easily be believed by them who shall read <HI>Nennosies</HI> in Bibliothec. <HI>Photii.</HI> n. <HI>3.</HI> Where he writes of <HI>Elephants,</HI> no small Number near five thousand.</NOTE> But it is almost incredi∣ble to be told, what a havock they make in the Fields and Woods: they will shake Trees bigger then themselves in Bulk, so long, till either their Trunks break, or the whole Tree be torn up by the Roots, as with an Earthquake. Smal∣ler Trees they snap off about a hands breadth from the Ground. As for shrubs and underwoods, and all sorts of fruit Trees, they either eat 'em up, or trample 'em under their feet. <HI>Gregory</HI> was wont to say, That they open'd <HI>High ways,</HI> and where they had gone before, Travellers would rather choose to follow, as being less cumbersom. But least Food should be wanting to such Massie Creatures, Providence has provided: For in those Places there grow certain Trees about the bigness of Cherry-Trees, full of Pith, like Elder; upon which they ban∣quet,
<PB N="55" REF="37"/>
as upon Grass. Of all the dumb Beasts, this Creature certainly shares the most of Human Understanding: kind u∣sage excites their Ambition, contumely fires their Revenge. Of which many Examples are extant among the Writers of Na∣tural Historie. <HI>Gregory</HI> told us, that where they like their Entertainment, they are very punctual in observing the Laws of Hospitality; though one of the Females would have serv'd her Host but an ugly trick after her departure from her Lodg∣ing. This Elephant had brought forth a Young one, in a certain Field which her Landlord had sow'd with Corn; who willing to dislodge such an unwelcome Guest, had resolv'd to kill the said Elephant: his Neighbours dissuaded him, assure∣ing him, that the slaughter would not be unreveng'd; but on the other side, that she would defend his ripe Harvest against all others, and therefore advis'd him to let her alone, till she had brought up her Cubb; but withal, so soon as she had done that, forthwith to reap his Harvest. The Husband∣man following this Counsel, preserv'd his Harvest untouch'd, suffering no other Injury than what the Beast spoil'd in her passage to and fro. After the Female had carryed away her young ones from that Place, the Husbandman by the help of his Neighbours got in his Harvest with all speed. The next Night the Elephants came in Troops, with an intention to have Supp'd with their Landlord before their departure, but found the Table taken away, and the Buttery Empty. The People of the Country aver, that they are not their Teeth, but their Horns of which the Ivory is made; and indeed, their substance and situation demonstrate the same thing: for they grow out of the Head and not out of the Jaws: and besides that, they only adorn the brows of the Males; the Females like our Does have none at all. The Elephant ne∣ver offers to attempt upon any person, unless provok'd; if he be threatn'd with sticks or cudgels, he hides his <HI>Probosces</HI> under his Belly, and goes away braying; for he is sensible it may be easily chop'd off: the extream parts of it being very nervous and tender, which cause him to be afraid of hard blows. At the end of it three little sharp pointed Langets come forth, by the help of which, he can take up the smallest thing that is, as men do with their fingers. They never take care to tame them here, where there is no use of them, either in Peace or War, among so many high Mountains.</P>
<P>The next is, the <HI>Camelo-pardalis,</HI> or <HI>Panther-Camel,</HI> which is
<PB N="56" REF="38"/>
and bulkie as the Elephant, but far exceeds him in tallness. For this Beast is so very high, that a man of a just Statue, reaches but up to his knees, so that it seems very credible what is reported, That a Man on horseback sitting upright on his saddle, may ride under his Belly. He derives his Name from hence, that he has a long Head, and a long Neck like a Camel, but a Skin spotted all over like a Panther. The <HI>Romans,</HI> when they first beheld this Beast, called it a <HI>Wild-Sheep,</HI> tho being more remarkable for its Aspect, then its Wild∣ness, or Fierceness; as we read in <HI>Pliny.</HI> By the <HI>Abissines,</HI> by reason of the smallness of his Tayl, he is call'd <HI>Jerataka∣ein;</HI> that is, <HI>slender Tayl:</HI> by the Italians <HI>Giraffa:</HI> from the Arabian word <HI>Zucaffa.</HI></P>
<P>But there is a Beast which is called <HI>Zecora,</HI> which for beau∣ty exceeds all the Four-footed Creatures in the World. They of <HI>Congo</HI> give it the Name of <HI>Zebra.</HI> This Creature is about the bigness of a Mule, and is brought out of the Woods of <HI>Habessinia,</HI> and the Countries possessed by the <HI>Galans,</HI> and ea∣sily tam'd. A present of great esteem and frequently given to the Kings of <HI>Habessinia. Tellez</HI> briefly describes him thus, <HI>A Circle of a black Colour encompasses his Loyns like a girdle; adjoyning to which, Nature has pencill'd out several others, some broader some narrower, some black, and some of a bright shining Ash-Colour; with so much Elegancy and Order, as no Painters Art can equalize. His Eares are the only thing that disfigures him; being of a disproportionable length: for which reason he is called by the</HI> Portugals <HI>Burro do Matto, (though improperly) the wild Ass.</HI> But you may guess at his beauty, by his price. For King <HI>Susneus</HI> having given one of these Beasts to the Turkish <HI>Basha</HI> of <HI>Suaqena,</HI> he sold the same for Two thousand <HI>Veneti∣an</HI> Pieces, to a certain <HI>Indian,</HI> that bought him for a Present to the great <HI>Mogul.</HI></P>
<P>The Lyon, tho he excel in fierceness and cruelty all the rest of the wild Beasts; yet he shews a certain kind of Magna∣nimous respect to Man. For he never injures him, unless he be ready to Famish, so that he do not betray his own<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Solin.</HI> in his Polyhist. c. <HI>17.</HI> al. <HI>40.</HI> allows them many marks of Clemency: they sooner assail Men then Women; they never kill Infants, unless pinched with hunger.</NOTE> fear.

Bulls are so terrified that they tremble every joynt, un∣able to contain their Urine: and yet the <HI>Habessines</HI> will ven∣ture to Encounter him. <HI>Tellez</HI> relates a story of a Shepherd, who kill'd a Lyon, that was eight Cubits in length from Head to Foot, without the help of any other Weapon than two <HI>Ja∣velins.</HI> They also use to tame their Whelps, but there is no trusting to their Education.</P>
<P><HI>Tygers</HI> and <HI>Panthers</HI> are much more Cruel and Fierce than <HI>Lyons,</HI> for they never spare Mankind: yet they covet the <HI>Ethi∣opians</HI> before <HI>White-men,</HI> as more accustomed to that sort of Dyet. These two Beasts differ only in<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Panthers</HI> and <HI>Tygers</HI> are the only Beasts remarkable for the variety of their Spots, saith <HI>Pliny,</HI> L. <HI>8. c. 17.</HI> In which place, the <HI>Panther</HI> is taken for the <HI>Leopard;</HI> but when the <HI>Panther</HI> is oppos'd to the <HI>Leopard,</HI> then it is to be taken for the <HI>Tygre.</HI> For the Antients have not accurately enough distinguished these Beasts, as being very much like to one another, and very rarely or never seen together.

<P>As for their <HI>Wolves,</HI> they are small and lazie, such as <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Aegypt</HI> bred in former times, as <HI>Pliny</HI> testifies:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>L.</HI> 8. <HI>c.</HI> 22.</NOTE> But the <HI>Hyaena,</HI> or the <HI>Crocuta</HI> neer akin to the <HI>Wolfe,</HI> is the most Voracious of all the wild Beasts;<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Begot between a <HI>Hyena</HI> and a <HI>Lioness:</HI> familiar to <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> See <HI>Solinus</HI> c. <HI>65.</HI> and <HI>Salmatius</HI> upon him.</NOTE> for she not only by Night and by stealth, but openly and in the day time Preys upon all she meets with, Men or Cattle, and rather than fail, diggs down the walls of Houses and Stables. <HI>Gregory</HI> de∣scrib'd her to be speckl'd, with black and white spots.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Apes</HI> there are infinite Flocks up and down in the Moun∣tains themselves, a thousand and more together: there they leave no stone unturn'd. If they meet with one that two or three cannot lift, they call for more Ayd, and all for the sake of the Worms that lye under; a sort of Dyet which they re∣lish exceedingly. They are very greedy after <HI>Emmets.</HI> So that having found an Emmet-hill, they presently surround it, and laying their fore Paws with the hollow downward up∣on
<PB N="58" REF="41"/>
the Ant-heap, as fast as the Emmets creep into their trea∣cherous Palmes, they lick 'em off with great comfort to their Stomachs: and there they will lie till there is not an Emmet left. They are also pernicious to fruit and Apples, and will destroy whole Fields and Gardens, unless they be carefully look'd after. For they are very cunning, and will never venture in till the return of their Spies, which they send always before; who giving Information, that all things are safe, in they rush with their whole Body, and make a quick dispatch. There∣fore they go very quiet and silent to their Prey; and if their young ones chance to make a noise, they chastise them with their fists, but if they find the Coast clear, then every one hath a different noise to express his joy. Nor could there be any way to hinder them from further Multiplying, but that they fall sometimes into the ruder hands of the wild Beasts, which they have no way to avoid, but by a timely flight, or creep∣ing into the clefts of the Rocks. If they find no safety in flight, they make a vertue of necessity, stand their ground, and filling their Paws full of Dust or Sand, fling it full in the Eyes of their Assailant, and then to their Heels again.</P>
<P>But there is another sort of Creature very harmless, and ex∣ceeding sportive, call'd in the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Language <HI>Fonkes,</HI> in the <HI>Amharc</HI> Dialect <HI>Guereza,</HI> (which is a kind of <HI>Marmoset</HI>) and in <HI>Latine Cercopitheculus.</HI> Of which the following Rhime is common in several parts of <HI>Ethiopia.</HI></P>
<Q><L>I put no Man to pain,</L>
<L>I eat not his Grain,</L>
<L>They hate me in vain.</L></Q>
<P>They are varie-Colour'd, and skie-Colour'd mixt with gray: <HI>India</HI> breeds them white, and beautiful; but so tender, that unless they be wrapt very warm, and carry'd in your bo∣some, they cannot be brought into these Parts. Whether it be the <HI>Calli-triches,</HI> or <HI>Fair-hair</HI> of the Ancients, I leave to others to judge. Of them, after a Discourse of <HI>Apes,</HI> thus <HI>Plinie,</HI> The <HI>Calli-tricks</HI> differ in the shape of the whole Countenance. The Beard is in the midst of the face, the Tayl is broad in the fore-part; This Creature they say, lives no where but in the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Cli∣mate where it was bred. <HI>Solinus</HI> hath the same words, only ad∣ding; <HI>To catch these is easie, to bring away very difficult.</HI></P>

both Strong and Fierce, call'd <HI>Arweharis,</HI> from the Arabic <HI>Harish,</HI> or <HI>Harshaw,</HI> which signifies with one Horn. This Beast resembles a <HI>Goat,</HI> but very swift of Foot; whether it be the <HI>Monoceros</HI> of the Ancients, which as <HI>Jeronimus Lupus</HI> reports, is found in <HI>Habessinia,</HI> I leave to the Scrutinie of others. Many skilful Authors look'd upon this Four-footed Beast as a kind of <HI>Chimera,</HI> considering the idle Relations as if it could not be taken alive; that it was a Beast compos'd of two Creatures of different Forms: as if Writers were framing Fables concerning some Errour of Nature. However the <HI>Portugals</HI> tell us, that the Report was not altogether vain. For one of them was seen by <HI>John Gabriel,</HI> whom we have already nam'd, in the Province of the <HI>Agawi,</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Damota;</HI> it was a Beast with a fair Horn in the Fore-head, five Palmes long, and of a whitish Colour, about the big∣ness and shape of a middle siz'd Horse, of a Bay Colour, with a Black Main and Tayl, but short and thin (though some have been seen with longer and thicker) a lively Creature, haunting the thickest Woods, and seldom appear∣ing in the Fields. And lest there should be any doubt of the Truth of the thing, there was a young <HI>Colt</HI> brought to one of the Fathers of the Society, who was an Eye-witness of the reality of the thing. Moreover, several <HI>Portugueses,</HI> who were banish'd by the Emperour <HI>Adamas Saghed,</HI> into a certain high Rock in the Province of <HI>Nanina,</HI> which is a part of <HI>Gojam,</HI> have attested, that they saw several such <HI>Uni∣corns</HI> feeding in the Woods that lay under the said Moun∣tain.

And that as <HI>Bochartus</HI> learnedly teaches, was the Language that first taught the World. Nor does <HI>Job</HI>'s description disagree from that of the <HI>Hippopotamos,</HI> if compar'd. There are many of them in the Lake of <HI>Tzana,</HI> which infest the Neighbouring Fields, to the great dammage of the Corn. They overturn small Boats, which renders all passage by Water very unsafe to the Inhabitants, in re∣gard they lye in wait for the Men themselves.

<P><HI>Water-Lizards</HI> are very frequent every where, and those very large.

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. <HI>Of Birds.</HI></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The <HI>Struthiocamel,</HI> and the <HI>Casawaw,</HI> swifter than Horses; frequent in <HI>Africa:</HI> a great enemy to Doggs: the flesh of it good against Poy∣son. The <HI>Ibis</HI> and <HI>Ophiomachus</HI> kill Serpents. The <HI>Pipi</HI> betrays the wild Beasts to the Fowlers: the same Bird in <HI>Guiny.</HI> No tame <HI>Geese. Gregory</HI> wondred at his lying in Feather Bedds. No <HI>Cuccows</HI> nor <HI>Eagles.</HI> The <HI>Ruch</HI> and Birds of <HI>Condora</HI> Fabulous.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS the largest Four-footed Beasts are found in the Re∣gions and Seas of <HI>Habessinia;</HI> so do also the largest Fowl breed in the same Places. Though indeed, they may not properly be call'd Birds, for that they never rise upon the Wing, as the <HI>Struthiocamel</HI> or <HI>Ostrich,</HI> and the <HI>Casawaw</HI> or <HI>Casuarius</HI> next to him in Bulk. However, the swiftness of their Feet compensates the slowness of their Wings; they being able to out-run a Horse upon his full speed. As for the <HI>Ostrich,</HI> he is so well known, that he needs no further description. The <HI>Casuarius,</HI> or <HI>Casawaw</HI> is a Bird frequent in <HI>Africa:</HI> by the Inhabitants of <HI>Guiney</HI> call'd <HI>Eme,</HI> but the <HI>Habessines,</HI> and particularly those of <HI>Tygra</HI> give it the name of <HI>Casawaw,</HI> denoting thereby the Bulkiness of the Body. But for the <HI>Tinshemeth</HI> or <HI>Mergus,</HI> or as others Inter∣pret it the <HI>Swan,</HI> mention'd <HI>Deut.</HI> 14.16. The <HI>Abessines</HI> are in an Errour to mistake it for this Bird. For that is no more than the Greek <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <HI>Cygnus</HI> in Latine, which perhaps they had heard by report was bigger than all other Birds: this Fowl has a great antipathy against Doggs, which she eagerly pursues though with hazard of her Life. I had a young one sent me out of <HI>India</HI> which was kill'd by a Mastive; but the Skin I still preserve. The Flesh of the Fowl whether new or smoak'd is made use of in Remedies against the biting of Serpents, which was found out by observing how eagerly they devour them without harm. But Providence has not pro∣vided one single Enemy to their Serpents only. For the Egyptian <HI>Ibis,</HI> and the <HI>Ophiomachus,</HI> from his continual Enmi∣ty to those Vermine, call'd in the <HI>Amharic Dialect,</HI> the <HI>Serpent devourer,</HI> make great havock of those Venemous Creatures. So that <HI>Africa,</HI> though it breed most pernicious Animals, yet it affords most excellent Remedies against those Mischiefs.
<PB N="64" REF="49"/>
And indeed, some of those Birds seem to be granted to Man for the Extirpating the Enemies of their well being, which because they cannot vanquish themselves, they betray to them that they think more able. For there is a little Bird, by those of <HI>Tygra</HI> call'd from the Noise which it makes <HI>Pipi,</HI> which, strange to tell will, lead the Hunters to the Places where the Wild Beasts lye hid: never leaving their Note of <HI>Pipi,</HI> till the Hunters follow them, and kill the discover'd Prey. <HI>Gregory</HI> related to me, <HI>That as he was walking with one of his acquaintance, an Inhabitant of</HI> Tygra; <HI>this Bird cry'd</HI> Pipi <HI>over their heads; thereupon, understanding the meaning of it from his Friend, he resolv'd to try the Truth of the Story. The Bird conducted them to a shady Tree, about the boughs of which, a Monstrous huge Snake had Curl'd her self; at the sight whereof, he and his friend made more hast back again, than they did coming to satisfie their Curiosity.</HI> And indeed, it is not safe to follow this Bird, unless a man be provided with all his Hunting Instru∣ments: nevertheless, the Bird has her own ends in her dou∣ble diligence too: for she is sure to have her share of the Slaughtered Carcase whate're it be. Nor is this Bird to be found only in <HI>Habessinia,</HI> but also in <HI>Guiny</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Quoja,</HI> where they give it the Name of <HI>Fonton,</HI> being about the bigness of a Larke, where it is reported to betray not only wild Beasts, but also Serpents and Bees.</P>
<P>They have no tame <HI>Geese:</HI> and therefore <HI>Gregory</HI> obser∣ving a Flock of <HI>Geese</HI> once driven along by their Keeper; <HI>pleasantly demanded of me, Whether those Birds were obedient to their Keeper?</HI> to whom, when I reply'd <HI>yes;</HI> he asked me a se∣cond, Whether if they flew, the Keeper flew too, and Whether before or behind? but when I told him what pro∣fitable Birds they were, he extoll'd them for blessed Feather-bearing birds; especially, when he had layn upon their soft Down at the Castle of <HI>Gota:</HI> for he had never layn upon a Feather-bed before he came into <HI>Germany:</HI> So that he thought that the <HI>German</HI> beds swelling with light Down, had been blown up with the Wind. But he Admir'd that the <HI>Ger∣mans</HI> were Arriv'd at that height of delicacy, that Men should stoop to so much Effeminacy as to lay themselves, where it was only fit for Children, and Women in Child-bed to lye. For he did not believe they would easily take the Field, un∣less their soft beds followed them. As for other <HI>European</HI> birds, they have most of them: and for their Water Fowl

</ARGUMENT>
<P>FRom hence we pass to another sort of Creatures, mischievous to Men and Beasts, of which there are divers kinds. In the first place, <HI>Dragons</HI> of the lar∣gest size are in <HI>Habessinia</HI> to be found; mischievous, only in their voracity, but not at all Venomous; Nature provi∣ding that they should not be doubly hurtful to men. How∣ever they grow to such a bigness, that <HI>Gregory</HI> allow'd there were some in <HI>India</HI> so large, as to swallow whole Insants, Piggs, Lambs and Kidds: he further said, that they were co∣ver'd with Scales, which in Colour very much resembl'd the bark of an old Tree, and hard to be distinguish'd from the big∣ger boughs. Of the <HI>Boa,</HI> that devour'd Oxen, he had never heard; neither did he believe that ever any other person
<PB N="66" REF="50"/>
would. Of the <HI>Salamander, Gregory</HI> could tell me nothing; which of all Venomous Creatures, as <HI>Plinie</HI> reports, is ac∣counted the most Exquisitely Mischievous. In <HI>Java</HI> the Grea∣ter, it is called<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See the Itinerarie of <HI>Volcard Iversen,</HI> L. <HI>1.</HI> c. <HI>7.</HI> It is somewhat like an <HI>Est</HI> or <HI>Newt.</HI> Consult <HI>Bochart</HI> Likewise <HI>Hieroz.</HI> P. <HI>1.</HI> l. <HI>4.</HI> c. <HI>4.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Jeko,</HI> as some think from the sound that it makes; or as others believe, from the most pernicious Effects of its Poyson. However there are in <HI>Habessinia</HI> other Ser∣pents, whose Venome is of a most searching Nature. Such are those sort of Snakes called <HI>Hydri,</HI> inferiour to none for their Poyson; they breed in Ponds and Marshy Puddles which are dry'd up in the Summer: and then the Serpents appear∣ing in the same places, are by the <HI>Greeks</HI> call'd<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">As much as to say <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Aetius</HI> L. <HI>13.</HI> c. <HI>35.</HI> or Water-Snake upon the Land.</NOTE> <HI>Chersydri:</HI> at which time, they are also far more Mischievous, as being ex∣asperated by Thirst and Heat; and of these, unless I deceive my self, is the Description of <HI>Gregory</HI> to be understood. <HI>There is,</HI> said he, <HI>a Serpent among us, about as long and as bigg as a Mans Arm, of a dark red or brownish Colour, which lurks under Bushes and Weeds: thither if any Person or Beast happen to come, the Serpent breaths forth a Poysonous Breath</HI><NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">This circumstance induced me to believe, that <HI>Gregory</HI> meant the Serpents call'd <HI>Hydrus</HI> and <HI>Chersydrus,</HI> or <HI>Land-water-Snake,</HI> by reason that Authors allow them a venemous noysom breath. <HI>Virg.</HI> L. <HI>3. Georg. Aelian. Hist.</HI> L. <HI>8.</HI> c. <HI>13.</HI></NOTE> <HI>so Pestilent, and of so noisom a smell, that in a short time proves Mortal, unless speedy Antidotes be applyed.</HI> Which Nature has afforded ready at hand, where the mischief requires so speedy a prevention. <HI>For,</HI> as he said, <HI>it was to be cur'd by drinking Human Excrement in Water.</HI> Which Remedy perhaps the <HI>Panther</HI> taught: which Beast, if at any time he hath devoured Flesh laid for him by the Hunters rub'd over with <HI>Henbane,</HI> cures himself by eating Human ordures: for many things which are be∣neficial to Beasts, are in like manner advantageous to Man∣kind. Other sorts of Serpents commonly and generally known I forbear to mention. The vulgar sort of People contemn 'em, walk among 'em, and kill 'em at their plea∣sure. Therefore as often as they go into the Country, they carry with them a croked stick; for being streight, it hits only with the Point; but being bent like a Bow, it strikes with greater force and certainty. <HI>Gregory</HI> hearing there were a great many Serpents about <HI>Helburgh</HI> in <HI>Franconia,</HI> belonging
<PB N="67" REF="50"/>
to the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> provided himself with such a sort of Weapon, and when he met a Snake, never struck it upon the head, but upon the middle of the back; by which means, ha∣ving disabled the Serpent from creeping any further, he easily kill'd it.</P>
<P>Those parts of <HI>Africa</HI> which are most subject to heat, are most Infested with <HI>Serpents;</HI> which being for the same reason uncultivated, are therefore impassable. And therefore <HI>Gregory</HI> seeing our Boots, said they were excellent defences against the Biting of <HI>Serpents.</HI> Sometimes they drive their Cattle, as I am apt to believe, fortified before-hand, by feeding upon the Plant <HI>Assazoe,</HI> into the Fields and places that are strew'd with <HI>Serpents</HI> Eggs, on purpose that they should trample 'em to pieces with their Hoofs: otherwise, they are so Fruitful that they would encrease beyond Imagination.</P>
<P>But much more pernicious than these are the <HI>Locusts,</HI> which do not frequent the Desert and Sandy places like the <HI>Serpents;</HI> but places best Manur'd, and Orchards most laden with Fruit. They appear in Prodigious Multitudes, like a thick Cloud that obscures the Sun: nor Plants, nor Shrubs, nor Trees remain untouch'd: and wheresoever they feed, their leavings seem as it were parch'd with the Fire. Sometimes they enter the very Bark of the Trees, and then the Spring it self can∣not repair the Damage. A general Mortality ensues, and Re∣gions lye wast for many years; in regard the <HI>Habessines</HI> never take care<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dapper</HI> in his Description of <HI>Guiny,</HI> or the <HI>Golden-shoar, p. 459.</HI> but in this he is deceiv'd; because he says, they came out of <HI>Arabia</HI> the Happy, so far off.</NOTE> for Stores of Provision, or to stack their Hay. Indeed, for some time they may support themselves by feed∣ing upon the <HI>Locusts</HI> themselves, which they greedily eat, as well to satisfie their hunger as in Revenge; for it is a very sweet and wholesom sort of Dyet: by means of which, a cer∣tain <HI>Portuguez</HI> Garrison in <HI>India,</HI> that was ready to yield for want of Provision, held out till it was Relieved another way. And therefore it is not to be doubted, but that St. <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist</HI> fed upon these <HI>Locusts</HI> in the <HI>Wilderness.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning other Insects, of which that Climate is suffi∣ciently fruitful, it will be needless to say much more; on∣ly as to their <HI>Bees,</HI> we have this to observe; That they swarm in <HI>Habessinia,</HI> and produce Prodigious quantities of Honey: They are a small sort of black Earthing-<HI>Bee,</HI> which make
<PB N="68" REF="51"/>
the whitest and the sweetest Honey that is used in Medica∣ments. From their Labours the <HI>Habessines</HI> gather their wild Honey, of the same nature with that which fed <HI>John the Bap∣tist;</HI> but in regard they want Stings, they seek for security in concealment; for they build their Architecture under Ground, into which the entrance is so narrow, that upon the sight of a man, five or six of them will fill it, and place their little heads equal with the ground so like Artists, as to delude the quickest sight.</P>
<P>Next to these their <HI>Ants</HI> or <HI>Emmets</HI> are very remarkable; of which, there are likewise several sorts, not so bigg as a small Dogg,<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">This I rather believe, than the story of <HI>Plinie,</HI> L. <HI>11. 9. 30.</HI> concerning <HI>Emmets</HI> among the Northern <HI>Indians,</HI> that dig up great pieces of Gold; themselves as big as <HI>Egyptian Foxes. Soline</HI> also makes them as big as great Doggs. <HI>Polyhist.</HI> c. <HI>40.</HI> al. <HI>27.</HI></NOTE> such as <HI>Thuanus</HI> relates, was sent among other Presents, by <HI>Thamus</HI> the <HI>Persian King,</HI> to <HI>Solyman</HI> Emperour of the <HI>Turks,</HI> but bigger than those in our Climates; as the <HI>African</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Insects generally are. Among the rest, the most observable are those which they call <HI>Gundan,</HI> for they always march in a kind of Military Array, observing Order and Discipline, leaving a kind of High-way behind them. They do not gather with industry, but presently de∣vour; and the pricks of their Stings are not a little painful. The next to these, are those which by the Inhabitants are call'd, the <HI>Gundan</HI>'s Servants, being as it were Slaves to the Greater sort; they march in Order, but carry their Provision in the nippers of their little Snowts, and lay it up; when it is moist they bring it forth again and dry it in the Sun: of these, by reason of their great Industry, it is thought, that <HI>Solomon</HI> spake. There are some that have Wings at certain seasons, with which they can Fly; which happens some∣times in <HI>Germanie:</HI> once I saw such in my own Country; and these flying <HI>Ants,</HI> I remember, were easily devoured by the Poultrie.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIV.</HI> Of the Nature and Genius of the Inhabitants.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The <HI>Habessines</HI> of a towardly disposition. The commendations which <HI>Tellezius</HI> gives them. The best of all the <HI>Africans.</HI> Servants of this Nation priz'd all over the World. <HI>Prester-Chan,</HI> why so called. The <HI>Habessi∣nes</HI> desirous of Arts and Sciences; especially, the <HI>Latine Tongue.</HI> The causes of <HI>Gregorie</HI>'s going into <HI>Germany.</HI> They want the Opportuni∣ties of attaining to Learning, and why? They of <HI>Tygra</HI> are blam'd. For shape and features the <HI>Habessines</HI> excell. White <HI>Ethio∣pians</HI> in <HI>Guiny.</HI> They prefer Blackness. They paint the Devil White. The Men very strong. So are the Women, and bring forth with little pain. Nor are they unfruitful, and therefore the Country Populous. The <HI>Jews</HI> Inhabiting among them, formerly enjoy'd their own Priviledges, now Dispers'd and Exiles. They use a corrupt <HI>Talmudic</HI> Dialect. Mahumetans mixt with Christians, Pagans innumerable, wandring; Naked Creatures, by the <HI>Portugals</HI> call'd Cafres, or In∣fidels.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAving thus given an account of the Beasts, Insects, and Fish, peculiar to these Regions, we are now to speak of the Inhabitants; Man being the most per∣fect of all the Creation, and for whose benefit the rest were designed. And first, we must confess, That there is not the same harshness and roughness in the Dispositions of the Peo∣ple, as in the nature of the Soyl: for the <HI>Habessines,</HI> as <HI>Tel∣lezius</HI> Witnesses, in other things not so just to them, are well inclin'd, and of an excellent good Nature.</P>
<P><HI>All the</HI> Habessines, (saith he) <HI>are endu'd with a pregnant Wit, and goodness of Disposition; not Cruel, nor Bloody: they easily for∣give Injuries; there are few Quarrels among them, or if any do arise, they are seldom determin'd by the Sword; only Boxing and Cuffing decides the difference: They are Naturally given to Justice and Equity; so that having Cufft a while, they presently choose Arbitrators, or repair to the Lord of the Place, and there set forth their Complaint in Words, without any of our Parchment Ambiguities, and hearing the Sentence which he gives, submit with∣out any delay or tergiversation: So that they have no need of An∣swers and Replies, and Rejoynders, and Exceptions; but avoid the noise of the Bar, and the expences of Pleading.</HI></P>
<P>And when he inveighs against <HI>Adamas—Saghed,</HI> the Prince of the <HI>Habessines,</HI> he adds, <HI>That he had forgot the Lenity, Truth,
<PB N="70" REF="52"/>
and Christian Piety, which wonted to be almost natural to the</HI> Abes∣sines.</P>
<P>But before all the rest he prefers those of <HI>Enarea</HI> by the Confession of the <HI>Habessines</HI> themselves. For<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">For those are his words, L. <HI>4.</HI> c. <HI>30.</HI> pag. <HI>177. a.</HI></NOTE> those he com∣mends above all others, both for their Endowments as well of Body as Mind; and for their Courage and Fidelity. A Testimony which certainly contains a very high Applause of a Nation, otherwise rude and impolish'd; so that if they had but the advantages of Education, most certain it is, that the <HI>Abessines,</HI> would prove the most ingenious and understanding people of all <HI>Africa;</HI> which is well known all over the <HI>East:</HI> And therefore Servants out of this Nation, are sold for more, and more esteem'd than Slaves out of any other of the Black Nations whatever. For which cause some Learned Men are of Opinion, that the King of the <HI>Abissines</HI> was therefore call'd <HI>Prester-Chan,</HI> for that in the <HI>Persian</HI> Language <HI>Prester-Chan</HI> signifies<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jacob Golius,</HI> at <HI>Blancard</HI> alleadges in his Notes upon <HI>Curtius.</HI></NOTE> A Prince of the best Servants, being taken in War, or otherwise by Pirates, and sold to the <HI>Mahumetans.</HI> If they were not well grounded before in the Christian Religi∣on, they are easily seduced to renounce their Christianity, for that there is no Circumcision exacted from them, as being al∣ready Circumciz'd: and then again, though they be Foreign∣ers and bought with Money, yet are they often advanc'd to Dukedoms and Governments, and rise to great Preferments above the Natives and Free-men. They are most Covetous after Learning, and desirous of the knowledg of Arts and Sciences. Nor was there any other greater reason of that kindness which was shewed to the Fathers of the Society to∣wards the beginning of this Century, in <HI>Habessinia,</HI> but that they were skilled in all sorts of Arts and Sciences, and there∣fore admir'd by the King and Princes of the Nation. For they love and reverence all sorts of Forrain Christians that are adorn'd with the Ornaments of Art and Learning. <HI>Gregory</HI> related to me, That when the <HI>Portuguess</HI> Patriarch carried thi∣ther a great number of very fair Books, sundry of the No∣bility, and among the rest, <HI>Tine,</HI> one of the King's Councel∣lors, expressed himself with a Sigh in these words. <HI>Oh hap∣py he that can understand all these Books!</HI> And many persons of full years, hearing of the excellency and large use of the
<PB N="71" REF="52"/>
Latine Language, have most Ardently desired to learn it. And that indeed seemed to me to be the most prevailing rea∣son, why our <HI>Gregory</HI> though stricken in years, undertook so long a journey after me into <HI>Germany;</HI> and why <HI>Acalex</HI> a young <HI>Habessine</HI> followed him soon after; though not being under∣stood in <HI>Germany</HI> where he pronounced <HI>Ehrfaher</HI> instead of <HI>Erfurt</HI> he had the ill fortune to lose his labour. Therefore they neither want ingenuity nor industry, but only Opportu∣nity and Assistance, for they never travel long Journies: our <HI>Europeans</HI> are hindred by the difficulties of getting into their Country, and the tediousness of the Journey, whether by Land or Sea: and besides all this the Envy of the <HI>Turks</HI> joyn'd to their implacable Avarice will not permit them to suffer us to Import our Arts of Peace and War, to their own and the disadvantage of the rest of the <HI>Mahumetans.</HI> Lastly, their continual Civil Broyls, and Forraign Wars with the <HI>Gallans</HI> are such as will not allow the Nobility leisure to mind the Studies of Tranquillity.</P>
<P>But among such a variety of people, it is impossible, that the same manners and dispositions should be in all; for Nature has brought forth nothing so good in the Universe, which has not something of Evil mix'd with it. Thus <HI>Tellez</HI> sets a ve∣ry bad Character upon the Inhabitants of <HI>Tigra;</HI> who, as he says, are a People irresolute and faithless; inconstant, and false-swearer, bloody and Vindictive; so that Enmities in Fami∣lies among them remain from Posterity to Posterity. <HI>Godig∣nus</HI> gives the same report: saying, <HI>That in all</HI> Ethiopia <HI>there is no Nation like them for their vile manner of living and ill Cu∣stomes.</HI></P>
<P>But as the <HI>Habessines</HI> generally excell in generosity of Mind and smartness of Understanding, so do they far exceed all other <HI>Ethiopians</HI> in shape of Body, and symmetrie of Linea∣ments; the rest of the <HI>Africans</HI> being generally mark'd with a Blubber Lipp'd and Flat Nos'd deformity.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Habessines, <HI>saith</HI> Tellez, <HI>are remarkable for the compleat shape of their Bodies; of a due procerity, free and chearful Coun∣tenance, and thin Nos'd, that is not flat Nos'd, nor blubber Lipp'd; so that our</HI> Europeans <HI>exceed them only in Colour: in other Per∣fections of Proportion they differ little or nothing. They are gene∣rally Black, which they most admire: Some are Ruddie Complexioned; some few White, or rather Pale and Wan, without any grace or welfavouredness.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="53"/>True it is, there are some <HI>Whites</HI> among the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> in other places, but they look like the countenances of Dead Men, or as if they had the Leprosie: which other Authors also Testifie, but write withal, that it proceeds for some Disease in the Body, and therefore other <HI>Ethiopians</HI> avoid being<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">The Famous <HI>Isaac Vossius</HI> in his Book of the Original of <HI>Nile</HI> and other Rivers, believes that those <HI>Ethiopians</HI> are truly Leprous, and that the difference of Colour pro∣ceeds from the Disease: but with submission to so great a person, I should think that a Nation so Infected could not long endure: nor that the King of <HI>Lovangi</HI> would ad∣mit Leapers into his Guard.</NOTE> breathed upon, or touched by them, as believing them Con∣tagious. Also in the Midland parts of <HI>Guiney</HI> there is a Na∣tion consisting all of <HI>White People,</HI> which are therefore call'd <HI>Leuc-Ethiopes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plin. <HI>l.</HI> 5. <HI>c.</HI> 8.</NOTE> or <HI>White Ethiopians,</HI> and of these the ancient Authors make mention. However, the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> are pleas'd with their own <HI>Blackness,</HI> and prefer it before the <HI>White Colour.</HI> Neither would <HI>Gregory</HI> permit himself to be overcome with this Argument, That our Children were frighted at the sight of an <HI>Ethiopian;</HI> averring, that their Children were as much terrified at the sight of our <HI>White Europeans:</HI> they are not born Black, but very Red; and in a short time turn Black: Some Authors write, that the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> paint the Devil <HI>white</HI> in dis∣dain of our Complexions.</P>
<P>Their strength of Body is extraordinary. And by reason of the admirable temper of the Air, they are extreamly vi∣vacious and patient of Labour; nor are they easily wearied with clambering their own Rocks. They live till meerly dissolv'd by pure decrepid Age, unless they fall by the Sword, or are devoured by the Wild Beasts, as <HI>Salust</HI> writes of the <HI>Africans</HI> in his time. I am apt to think, that the <HI>Macrobii,</HI> or <HI>Long-livers,</HI> formerly Inhabited some part of <HI>Habessinia,</HI> for that the Ancient Writers report them settl'd beyond <HI>Meroe.</HI> <NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Solin</HI> in <HI>Polyhist.</HI> c. <HI>43.</HI> al. <HI>30.</HI> out of <HI>Pomponius Mela.</HI> The Long-livers, or <HI>Macrobii,</HI> saith he, <HI>Honour Justice, Love Equitie; they are very strong, and particularly well-favoured.</HI> But presently after he brings in the old Fable, the Fable of the <HI>Sun;</HI> which <HI>Herodotus</HI> sets forth at large, <HI>L. 3.</HI> where he Treats of the <HI>Am∣bassie of Cambyses to the King of the</HI> Macrobii.</NOTE> Their Women are also strong and lusty, and bring forth with little pain, as most Women do in hot Countries.

And that they are Fruitful you may well
<PB N="73" REF="53"/>
imagine from the Multitude of People; for though <HI>Habes∣sinia</HI> be not so numerously Inhabited; yet the Latine Patri∣arch <HI>Alphonsus Mendez,</HI> going his Visitation, in one little Pro∣vince, reckon'd Forty thousand; in other places, a Hundred thousand: and in other places, others of the Fathers Baptiz'd a Thousand two hundred and five. Nor is it to be question'd but that if the Kingdom were at Peace; if their Cities and Towns were Fortify'd, and that they took care of their Gra∣naries, that the number of Inhabitants in so healthy a Coun∣try would soon be multiply'd.</P>
<P>Besides the <HI>Abyssines,</HI> several other Nations Inhabit this Kingdom, <HI>Jews, Mahumetans,</HI> with several <HI>Pagans</HI> mix'd amongst the rest. The <HI>Jews</HI> formerly held several fair and large Pro∣vinces, almost all <HI>Denbea,</HI> as also <HI>Wegara</HI> and <HI>Samen,</HI> stoutly and long Defending themselves by means of the Rocks, till they were driven thence by <HI>Susneus;</HI> at that time they also liv'd according to their own Customs; whence perhaps arose the report, already hinted at by us, That they liv'd either with∣in the Dominions of <HI>Prester John,</HI> or near them; under a Prince of their own. Now they are dispers'd, though many still remain in <HI>Dembea,</HI> getting their livings by Weaving, and exercising the Trade of Carpenters. Others have retired themselves without the bounds of the Kingdom, to the West∣ward near the River <HI>Nile,</HI> adjoyning to the <HI>Cafers,</HI> whom the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> call <HI>Falusjan,</HI> or <HI>Exiles.</HI> Most of them still keep up their own Synagogues, have their own <HI>Hebrew</HI> Bibles, and speak in a corrupt <HI>Talmudic Dialect.</HI> The Fathers of the Society never took care to enquire, when, or upon what oc∣casion the <HI>Jews</HI> came first into <HI>Ethiopia?</HI> whether they are addicted to the Sect of the <HI>Karri,</HI> or the <HI>Jews?</HI> what Sacred Books they use, whether with Points, or without Points? whether they have any other Books, especially Histories, or whether they have any Traditions concerning their own, or Nation of the Habessines? which to know, would certainly be most grateful to many Learned Men; in regard it seems very probable, that there may be found some Ancient Books among them, since they have liv'd so long and so securely in such inaccessible holds.</P>
<P>Next to these the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> are frequently admitted into this Kingdom intermix'd up and down the Country with the Christians; employing themselves altogether in Tillage or Merchandizing; Trade being all in their hands, by reason
<PB N="74" REF="54"/>
of their freedom of Traffick which the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Arabians</HI> grant them, and the liberty of Commerce which they have by their means in all the parts of the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> where they ex∣change the <HI>Habessinian</HI> Gold for <HI>Indian</HI> Wares.</P>
<P>There are yet many other Barbarous Nations, that wan∣der about in the <HI>sandy Deserts,</HI> having no knowledge of God, and living without any Government of King or Laws; va∣rying in Customes and Language, having no certain Habi∣tations, but where Night compells them to rest: Savage, Na∣ked, flat Nos'd, and blubber Lipp'd. <HI>Agriophagi,</HI> devourers of wild Beasts, or rather <HI>Pamphagi,</HI> All-eaters, for they feed upon<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">For many of the <HI>Barbarians</HI> have been nam'd from the particular Dyet they fed upon, as the Man-Eaters, Fish-Eaters, Ostrich-Eaters, <HI>&amp;c.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Antiquity of the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Language; its various Appellations: for∣merly the natural Language of those of <HI>Tigra:</HI> in that all their Books written. The <HI>Tegian</HI> Language what. <HI>Joh.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AMong so many and such variety of Nations, it is no wonder there should be such diversity of Lan∣guages. The most Noble and most Ancient Lan∣guage of this Kingdom is our <HI>Ethiopic,</HI> commonly so call'd by the Learned: for the Attaining of which, we set forth a <HI>Lexi∣con</HI> and <HI>Grammer</HI> some while since in <HI>England;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1661.</NOTE> the <HI>Abissines</HI> call it <HI>Lesana Itjopia,</HI> the Language of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> or <HI>Lesana Gheez</HI> and sometimes singly <HI>Gheez;</HI> or the Language of the Kingdom: or if you please, the Language of the Study; for that the Word signifies both: also the Language of Books; either because it is only us'd in Writing, or else because it is not to be attained without Study and Reading of Books: It was formerly the Natural Language of those of <HI>Tigra,</HI> when the Kings kept their Court at <HI>Aexuma,</HI> the Metropo∣lis of <HI>Tigra;</HI> in this Language all their Books, as well Sacred, as Prophane, were written, and still are written: and into this Language the <HI>Bible</HI> was formerly Translated. For whereas others Write, that the <HI>Abessines</HI> read the Scripture in the <HI>Tegian</HI> Language,<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Walton</HI> in his <HI>Prolegomena</HI> before the <HI>Bible,</HI> c. <HI>15.</HI> out of <HI>Alvarez,</HI> for the <HI>r.</HI> and the <HI>i.</HI> written without a Point after the <HI>Italian</HI> manner, deceiv'd the Readers.</NOTE> that's a mistake; for the <HI>Tegran,</HI> or the Language of <HI>Tigra,</HI> is to be understood of our <HI>Ethiopic.</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="55"/>
Though it be true, that since their Kings left <HI>Axuma,</HI> the Dia∣lect of this Country is very much alter'd; yet still it approaches nearest to the Ancient Language, which is as we but lately said, now call'd the <HI>Ethiopic:</HI> so that the <HI>Abissines</HI> themselves if they meet any doubtful word in this Language, presently consult those of <HI>Tygra,</HI> concerning the signification.</P>
<P><HI>John Potken,</HI> a <HI>German</HI> of <HI>Cologne,</HI> now Ancient and Gray, was the first that divulg'd this Language in <HI>Europe;</HI> and then setting up a neat <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Printing-House in <HI>Rome,</HI> there Im∣printed the first <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Books, that is to say, the <HI>Psalter,</HI> with the <HI>Hymns of the Old Testament,</HI> and the <HI>Canticles.</HI> In this deceiv'd that he gave too much Credit to certain Idle <HI>Habes∣sines,</HI> who Affirm'd, That as well their Language, as their <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Characters were<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ambrose Theseus,</HI> his Contemporary, mildly reproves him for it, in his <HI>Intro∣duction to the Oriental Languages;</HI> for saith he, with tenderness to his age and friendship, <HI>Thy Learning very much fails thee in this matter.</HI> Now <HI>Theseus</HI> stifly affirms, The <HI>Habessines</HI> to be <HI>Indians,</HI> and their Language <HI>Indian:</HI> perhaps the more tolerable Errour of the two.</NOTE> <HI>Chaldaic.</HI> I could not find out the Cause of so Gross an Errour; neither had <HI>Gregory</HI> ever heard it in his own Country: perhaps it fell out by reason of the likeness of the Language, though indeed it agree with the <HI>Chaldaic</HI> no more than with the <HI>Hebrew</HI> or <HI>Syriac;</HI> for it approaches nearest to the <HI>Arabic,</HI> of which it seems to be a kind of Production; as being comprehended almost within the same <HI>Grammatical Rules;</HI> the same forms of Conjugations; the same forms of Plurals, both entire and anomalous; so that whoever understands either that, or the rest of the <HI>Orien∣tal Languages,</HI> may with little labour understand this our <HI>Ethi∣opic.</HI> Neither is it useful alone for the understanding of the <HI>Habessine</HI> Books and Affairs, but for Illustrating and Expound∣ing the rest of the <HI>Eastern Languages,</HI> and first the <HI>Hebrew;</HI> of which there is yet a small remainder in the Bible; insomuch that the genuine significations of many words are to be fetch∣ed from the neighbouring <HI>Dialects:</HI> and many texts of Sacred Writ borrow that Light from hence; as shall be more amply demonstrated by Examples in our Commentary. One more then ordinarily remarkable we shall here produce. The <HI>La∣tines</HI> called the most Elegant and Delightful piece of Work∣manship of the Most Omnipotent God, <HI>Mundum,</HI> or the World: in imitation of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who nam'd the same thing

I know it is vulgarly deriv'd from the signification of<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">So most <HI>Lexicon</HI>-Writers; <HI>Buxtorf</HI> tells us, that <HI>Adamah,</HI> Earth, is so call'd as being of a <HI>Red,</HI> or Clay Colour. <HI>Schindler</HI> affirms, <HI>The true Earth, before it is dig'd is Red; and that</HI> Adam <HI>was Form'd out of Red Earth.</HI> Which are said vainly and gratis; neither does <HI>Kimchi</HI> in his Book of <HI>Roots</HI> mention any such Derivation.</NOTE> <HI>Redness,</HI> because the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Root <HI>Adam</HI> signifies to <HI>be Red.</HI> But how much of the Earth can we aver to be <HI>Red;</HI> certainly a very small quantity; so that it is most insipid to derive the Etymologie of so vast a Mass from <HI>Redness.</HI> There∣fore first Created Human Being himself, the common Parent of us all, deriv'd his Name <HI>Adam,</HI> not from the <HI>redness</HI> of the Earth, but from the Absolute Perfection of his Frame and Shape, as being the Master-piece, to speak <HI>more Hu∣mano,</HI> of his<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">But after his Fall, having lost his Primitive Beauty, he was admonish'd of his Mortality, by an Allusion to the Word <HI>Earth,</HI> out of which he was Created.</NOTE> Creator. For this signification, which has hitherto been unknown to the <HI>Lexicon</HI>-writers of most of the <HI>Oriental Languages,</HI> is most apparent from the <HI>Ethiopic;</HI> in which Language <HI>Adamah</HI> signifies <HI>Beautiful, Elegant, and Pleasant.</HI> Nor do the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> understand the Word <HI>Adam,</HI> otherwise than of a thing that is <HI>Beautiful.</HI> And there is no doubt, but that the City <HI>Adamah,</HI> before it was destroyed with <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> seated upon the Banks of <HI>Jordan,</HI> which are often compar'd to the<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Gaz-Jehovah,</HI> the Paradise of God, according to the Vulgar <HI>La∣tine</HI> Version.</NOTE> <HI>Garden of the Lord,</HI> was so call'd, from the Pleasantness of its Situation.</P>
<P>But <HI>Axuma</HI> being relinquish'd, and the <HI>Empire</HI> being tran∣slated into the Heart of the Kingdom, the Vulgar use of this our Language ceas'd. For the <HI>Zagean</HI> Line failing, when they set up a <HI>Sewan</HI> Prince, where the <HI>Amharic Dialect</HI> is vulgar∣ly spoken, and that some others who were Exiles in the Rock of <HI>Amhara,</HI> were call'd to the Government, the <HI>Amharic Dialect</HI> came into request. For the new King not well un∣derstanding the Language of <HI>Tygra,</HI> and having advanc'd about his Person his own Friends that spake the same Lan∣guage with him, brought his own <HI>Dialect</HI> into the Court and Camp; which being long fix'd there, and in the Parts adjoyn∣ing,
<PB N="78" REF="56"/>
was seldom remov'd into <HI>Tygra.</HI> In imitation of whom, the rest of the Nobility and great Personages used the same Speech. Thus the <HI>Amharic Dialect,</HI> otherwise call'd the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Language,</HI> being carry'd along with the Camp and Court over all the Kingdom, <HI>(t)</HI> got the upper hand of all the other Dialects, and the Ancient and more Noble <HI>Ethiopic Language</HI> it self: and at length became so Familiar to all the Chief of the <HI>Abissines,</HI> that you may easily by the use of that one Dialect Travel the whole <HI>Empire,</HI> though in seve∣ral Parts so extreamly differing in Dialect from one another. It differs from the <HI>Ethiopic,</HI> both in Construction and Gram∣mer; so that he who understands the one, cannot compre∣hend the other; yet he who understands the one, may easily learn the other, because that for above half the Language, as far as I can judge, the words are common to both. <HI>Grego∣ry</HI> could hardly be perswaded to Translate me the Lords Prayer, and some few Texts of Scripture into the <HI>Amharic Di∣alect,</HI> by reason of the difficulty to write it. For it has seven peculiar Characters not usual in the <HI>Ethiopic:</HI> however the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> retains its pristine Dignity, not only in their Books, but in their Divine Worship; as also in the Kings Letters Patents, and Commissions, which are dispatch'd in his Coun∣cil.</P>
<P>Therefore they are accounted Learned in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> that can but Read and Write it: for it is to be learnt out of Books, and by long use, as also by the Assistance of School-masters too, though they are very rare there; for they have neither Grammer nor Dictionary, which <HI>Gregory</HI> beheld here, not without Admiration. At first he extreamly wondred what I meant, when I requested of him the Root of any <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Word, at what time I was compiling my <HI>Lexicon;</HI> and seem∣ing to be much offended, asked whether I thought the <HI>Ethi∣opic</HI> Words grew upon Roots. But when he understood the scope and use of the <HI>Question,</HI> he cryed out, <HI>O the Learning of Europe!</HI> They are contented only with a <HI>Vocabularie,</HI> wherein according to several Classes, the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Words are Explained in the <HI>Amharic Dialect.</HI> They call it a <HI>Ladder,</HI> in imitation of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> who call such a kind of Book, a<NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Such is the</HI> Great Kopto-Arabic Scale, <HI>which</HI> Kircher <HI>published at</HI> Rome.</NOTE> <HI>Great
<PB N="79" REF="56"/>
Scale,</HI> or <HI>Ladder.</HI> The more unskilfull seek for such words therein which they do not understand in the <HI>Ethiopic;</HI> but there are very few that speak <HI>Ethiopic</HI> in <HI>Ethiopia</HI> it self. <HI>Gregory</HI> was perswaded to speak it for my sake, using at first many <HI>Amharic</HI> Words, which I observ'd also to happen in the Wri∣tings of their more unlearned Authors, before he could ac∣custom himself to the true <HI>Ethiopic.</HI> Both, but especially the <HI>Amharic</HI> are very difficult to pronounce, for there are Seven Letters in both <HI>k. t. d. t. e. p. tz.</HI> whose true Power unless it be that of <HI>d.</HI> is altogether unknown to the <HI>Europeans,</HI> so that it is almost impossible for them to shape their Tongues to speak several words, which makes me very ready to believe <HI>Plinie,</HI> when he Writes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>L.</HI> 5.</NOTE> That <HI>the Names of the People and Towns in</HI> Africa, <HI>are not to be utter'd but in their own Languages.</HI> Besides, the sound of their Vowels is so harsh and unplea∣sant, that they almost scare the hearer; the obscurity of their Language and Pronunciation corresponding with the Darkness of their Complexions.</P>
<P>But this variety of Speech is much more conspicuous in other Kingdoms and Provinces of this Empire. <HI>Tellezius</HI> Elegantly Writes, <HI>That there are as many Languages as King∣doms; nay; that there are different Dialects and Inhabitants in one and the same Kingdom. In</HI> Gojam, saith he, <HI>there are some Towns not far distant one from another, the</HI> Damotans, Gafatans, She∣wans, Setans, Shatans, <HI>besides the</HI> Agawi, <HI>the</HI> Gonge, <HI>and the</HI> Natives, <HI>whose Dialects differ as much as</HI> Portugueze <HI>from</HI> Itali∣an <HI>or</HI> French: <HI>But the Nobility and Learneder sort, as we make use of</HI> Latine, <HI>so they speak generally</HI> Amharic. That which follows, I had from <HI>Gregorie's</HI> Lips; by which the difference of their Language may be the better understood.</P>
<P>The Language of <HI>Tigra</HI> comes the nearest to our <HI>Ethiopic;</HI> as being least corrupted of all the rest.</P>
<P>To the <HI>Amharic</HI> Language, those of the Neighbouring Kingdoms come the nearest; though their Dialects are diffe∣rent one from another; for that of <HI>Bagemdra</HI> is peculiar: <HI>Angota, Hata, Gojam,</HI> and <HI>Shewa,</HI> use a Dialect common to one another.</P>
<P><HI>Gafata</HI> makes use of many <HI>Amharic</HI> words, but in so diffi∣cult a Dialect as requires a long time to understand it.</P>
<P><HI>Dembea</HI> speaks a Language, altogether different as well from the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> as <HI>Amharic.</HI></P>
<P>The Language of <HI>Gonga,</HI> is the same with that of <HI>Enarea,</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="57"/>
but different from all the other Speeches of <HI>Ethiopia.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Cambat</HI> the <HI>Gallans, Agawi,</HI> and <HI>Shankali,</HI> have each of them their distinct Languages, so that there are Eight or more Principal Languages in this Kingdom, and many more Dialects. For an Example of some of these dif∣ferences, the following Words signifie all one thing; that is to say, <HI>Lord,</HI> or <HI>Dominus.</HI></P>

From whence, as well the <HI>Turks</HI> as the <HI>Gallans</HI> have taken an occasion continually to vex them with Wars and wastful In∣roades. And first, the <HI>Turks,</HI> after they had possest them∣selves of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and slain the King of the <HI>Mamalukes,</HI> sent a Fleet into the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> to secure the <HI>Indian</HI> Navigation, which is vastly profitable to <HI>Egypt:</HI> for that the <HI>Portuguesses,</HI> to the intent they might enjoy the sole Trade of <HI>India,</HI> took all the Ships of the <HI>Saracens</HI> they could meet with, pretending a hatred of their Religion. The <HI>Turks</HI> therefore to shut up all the Ports of that Sea, made themselves Masters of <HI>Sua∣qena,</HI> and <HI>Matzua,</HI> Islands that formerly belong'd to the <HI>Ha∣bessines,</HI> which they might the more easily do, in regard the <HI>Habessines</HI> having their handsful by Land, took no care of their Sea Affairs. But soon after they became sensible, how vast an Inconvenience it was to have so Powerful a Neigh∣bour; finding what Potent Succours of Men and Fire-arms the <HI>Turks</HI> sent to assist their Enemies and those that revolted from them. Nor are they less frequently sensible of it to this day; in regard that neither Men nor Merchandize can be admitted into the <HI>Gulph,</HI> unless they request it from the <HI>Basha</HI> or his Deputies, with vast Expenses of rich Presents.</P>
<P>But the Fierceness and Cruelty of the <HI>Gallans</HI> is much more Formidable. For they having Subdu'd many Kingdoms &amp; Pro∣vinces thirst after all the rest; whence 'tis very probable what <HI>Tellezius</HI> writes, That unless they had fallen into Factions among themselves; or that the <HI>Habessines</HI> were not so Invin∣cibly secur'd within their own Rocks, they had been e're this utterly destroy'd. Therefore it seems but requisite, that I should here give an Accompt of the Original and Customs of these People: which I shall do as well from <HI>Tellezius,</HI> as from the Lips of our <HI>Gregory</HI> himself.</P>
<P>What time <HI>Etana-Denghel,</HI> sirnamed <HI>David</HI> was entangled in that fatal War with the <HI>Adelenses;</HI> that other Plague brake forth about the Year One thousand five hundred thirty seven, from the Kingdom of <HI>Bali.</HI> A certain number of Ser∣vants being cruelly handl'd by one <HI>Matthew</HI> a Noble-man,
<PB N="83" REF="58"/>
Revolted; and despairing of Pardon, associated to themselves all the Fugitives and Criminals that fled from the Punishment of their Mis-deeds, and liv'd upon Publick Spoil and Plunder, which they did with more success, in regard the Inhabitants of <HI>Bali</HI> were not able to oppose 'em: And for the <HI>Habessines,</HI> they being involv'd in Wars with the <HI>Adelans,</HI> contemn'd those inconsiderable Robbers. <HI>Tellez</HI> affirms them a particu∣lar Nation, and the same that Inhabited the <HI>Eastern Coast</HI> of <HI>Africa,</HI> and the Places adjoyning to the <HI>Indian Sea:</HI> perhaps those Servants, of whom <HI>Gregory</HI> makes mention, belong'd to that Neighbouring Nation, and flying to their own Coun∣try-men for Aid, discover'd <HI>Habessinia,</HI> and those Countries which were by their Servitude well known to them.</P>
<P>And now the <HI>Gallans,</HI> puft up with their success and rich Plunder, and increas'd in their number, having Subdu'd <HI>Bali,</HI> over-ran the neighbouring Kingdoms; But when they saw that what was won by Force must be defended by Force, they began to make Laws among themselves, very advanta∣geous for the Enlargement of their detestable Dominion, and the preservation of their untam'd and barbarous fierce∣ness. They are not so unlimited, as to despise Matrimo∣ny, like the <HI>Garamants,</HI> nor do they live commonly with their Women; but they have as many Wives as they please. The young Men are not permitted to cut their Hair, before they have kill'd an Enemy in the Field, or some wild Beast, an encouragement of boldness and hardiness to adventure; that by such a conspicuous Mark, the sluggish and cow-hearted should be distinguished, from the bold and da∣ring. . In their Banquets and Feasts the best Bit is alway set in the middle, and he that takes it, must be the first in any Perilous undertaking: nor is there any long consideration: every one prepares to win that Honour to himself, Ambi∣tion stimulating their Fortitude: but then there is a necessity of bringing some proof of an Enemy Slain, first they bring the Head, as the most modest part of the Body; but if there be any doubt of the Sex for want of a Beard, they cut off the most Obscene Parts of the Slain; a thing foul to relate: these they number, and heap up before the Army, as if their barbarous Fortitude could not be made appear without such kind of Testimony. However by those parts it is not ma∣nifest, whether he be a Friend or an Enemy that is Slain, and therefore the Head decides that Question. But their most
<PB N="84" REF="59"/>
prevailing encouragement in Battle is, that because no man should be thought to Fight for base hire, or out of servile Obedience for another man's honour, but only for his own Reputation, the Plunder is equally divided among them all. They go to War, as if they had devoted themselves for Victo∣ry, with a certain Resolution, either to Overcome or Dye: from whence proceeds great obstinacy in Combat. They use but few Weapons, at a distance they fight with Lances or Darts; hand to hand with Clubs or Stakes burnt at the end; relying more upon their Courage, than their Hands: They make their Shield of the skins of Oxen, or wild <HI>Bu∣falo's;</HI> formerly they fought for the most part afoot, now more frequently a Horse-back. And though the <HI>Abessines</HI> are generally more in Number, and better Arm'd, as also more skilful Horse-men, yet are they not able to withstand the vi∣olence of their furious Onsets. But how they may be Sub∣du'd we shall then declare, when we come to the Chap∣ter concerning the Power of the Kings of <HI>Habessinia.</HI></P>
<P>Being thus bred up to War, they abhor all peaceful Cal∣lings, believing it much better to ravish wealth, then get it by honest Labour; they willingly eat the Bread which they find among the <HI>Abessines,</HI> but do not love to grind the Corn; for they neither till nor sow their Lands, never minding Agriculture, but only grazing of Cattle: their Herds they drive before 'em, as well in War as in Peace, through the most fertile Pastures; upon the raw Flesh of which they ge∣nerally feed without Bread, and then drink their Milk; using the same sort of Food and Drink, both at home and in the field.</P>
<P>They never cumber themselves with any Baggage, not so much as Kitchin Utensils, only wooden Cups to drink their Milk in. Such wild Nations are generally a Terror to ci∣viliz'd People, whom Aboundance renders slothful, and Riches effeminate. Thus the <HI>Cimbrians, Goths, Vandals,</HI> and <HI>Normans</HI> over-ran the more civiliz'd Kingdoms of <HI>Europe.</HI> Thus the <HI>Oriental Tartars</HI> formerly Invaded <HI>China.</HI> The <HI>Gallans,</HI> if at any time overcome by the <HI>Habessines,</HI> retire with their Herds into remote Corners; Opposing only wild De∣serts, and Solitudes for their Enemies to Encounter. Every Eight Years they chuse one amongst them for their Leader, as it were a kind of Master of the Horse, whom they call <HI>Luva;</HI> and him all the rest of the Captains obey; but that
<PB N="85" REF="59"/>
is only in time of War: his first Enterprize is, to Muster the People together, and Invade <HI>Habessinia,</HI> for the sake of Ho∣nour and Bootie.</P>
<P>They have a Language peculiar to themselves, and diffe∣rent from all the rest of the <HI>Habessinian</HI> Dialects; which argues their Original both forrain and common to all their Tribes; they admit of Circumcision among themselves, whe∣ther it be by any ancient Custom, observed by many of the Neighbouring <HI>Ethnics,</HI> or for that they find the <HI>Arabians</HI> and <HI>Abessines</HI> to do the same.</P>
<P>They have no Idols, and but very little Divine Worship. If you ask them concerning God, or any Supreme <HI>Numen,</HI> or who it is that Governs the Earth with so much Order and Constancy? they answer, <HI>Heaven,</HI> which embraces in their view, all the rest; however they adore that <HI>Heaven</HI> with no Solemn Worship, more barbarous than the <HI>Barbari∣ans</HI> themselves: nor yet are they altogether void of Huma∣nity, for they aspire to a large share of Ingenuity, and in aptness to learn equalize the smartest of the <HI>Habessines.</HI> From whence we may observe, that there is no sort of Human∣kind so fierce and savage which may not be civiliz'd by Education and Learning. Many have submitted to the Instructions of Christianity, and persisted constant in the Faith. <HI>Tellezius</HI> testifies, and <HI>Gregory</HI> farther witnessed, That several Thousands of the <HI>Gallans</HI> were Converted to the Christian Religion, and submitted to Baptism under King <HI>Basilides.</HI> Now let me tell you, this is that formidable Na∣tion which has ruin'd the Power and Dominion of the <HI>Abessines;</HI> insomuch, that they have torn from the <HI>Abessine</HI> King above the half of those Territories which his Ancestors en∣joy'd; for after their Irruption out of <HI>Bali,</HI> they made them∣selves Masters of the Provinces of <HI>Gedmam, Angota, Dawara, Wed, Fatagar, Ifat, Guragea, Ganza, Conta, Damota, Waleka, Bizama,</HI> part of <HI>Shewa,</HI> and many intermix'd Kingdoms. Nor had they stopp'd there, had they not, being rent into Divisions among themselves, turn'd their Arms one against another, and given the <HI>Habessines</HI> a little breathing time: for Concord among Equals rarely long attends Prosperity. At this time they are divided into certain Tribes, (Seventy or more,) and as it were into Two Nations; of which the more <HI>Westerly</HI> are by the <HI>Habessines</HI> call'd <HI>Bertuma Galla,</HI> those that lye to the <HI>East, Boren Galla:</HI> those <HI>Easterly</HI> and <HI>Sou∣therly,</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="60"/>
in a manner encircle <HI>Habassia,</HI> and harrase it with fre∣quent Incursions. They have also separated <HI>Cambata</HI> and <HI>Enarea</HI> from the rest of the Body, as having subdu'd the Kingdoms that lye between; which makes it very difficult for the <HI>Abessine</HI> Prince to convoy home the Tribute of those Kingdoms. Thus there is a necessity for the <HI>Habessines</HI> to be always in War with these People; nor is there any hopes of regaining their ancient and pristine Glory, unless that Nation be first reduc'd into order. The King has prudently made use of their Intestine Discords; for he has plac'd the Revol∣ters in <HI>Dembea</HI> and <HI>Gojam,</HI> and successfully makes use of their Arms against their Country-men: for as they are the most excellent Antidotes, which are compos'd of the most Veno∣mous Animals themselves; so the <HI>Barbarians</HI> themselves are the most prevalent Force against the <HI>Barbarians.</HI></P>
<P>Now let us take a view of the Kingdom of <HI>Zandero,</HI> till lately undiscovered, although contiguous to <HI>Habessinia,</HI> as be∣ing not above four or five days from it. The Inhabitants are but little more civil than the <HI>Gallans,</HI> only that they ac∣knowledge a King, and have an awful respect for something, whether it be God or Devil. The King being dead, the next of Kin retire into the Wood, and there modestly wait the Election of the Nobility, who in quest of their King newly Elected among themselves, enter the Wood, guided by a certain Bird, of the <HI>Eagle</HI>-kind, which by the Noise it makes discovers the Conceal'd Person: presently they find him surrounded with a Guard of Lyons, Dragons, and Pan∣thers, <HI>(d)</HI> assembled together by a sort of Incantation to the Ancients unknown: At first he makes a resistance against the Electors, and wounds those that he can, that he may seem to be Constrained to take the Government upon him: soon after, as they are going along, another Gang, to whom it be∣longs of ancient Custom, endeavour to Rescue their King from the other Party, claiming to themselves the Honour of being the Persons that set the Crown upon the King's Head, and purchasing the hopes of Royal Favour, by means of a seeming Sport, which oft-times proves very Bloody. <HI>Thus instead of Inauguration, the</HI> African <HI>Gentiles think it Lawful to attone the Devil with human Blood.</HI> The King proud in the height of Poverty, not contented with the few steps to his Throne, gets upon the Beam of his House, from whence he looks down, as from a Gallery, and gives Answers to
<PB N="87" REF="60"/>
Embassadors. <HI>Antony Fernandez,</HI> Travelling with the <HI>Habes∣sinian</HI> Ambassador into that Kingdom, having viewed this same <HI>Lybian Soveraign,</HI> compares him for colour and gesture to a Rampant <HI>Monkey.</HI> Nor does the word <HI>Zendero,</HI> which is the Name of the Kingdom intimate much less, in regard that <HI>Zendero</HI> signifies an Ape. <HI>Tellezius</HI> adds, That it is the Custom of those <HI>Barbarians,</HI> if their King be wounded to kill him, which is conformable to the Nature of <HI>Monkeys,</HI> who having receiv'd a wound, tear and scratch it so long, till their Entrails drop out, or that they lose all their Blood.</P>
<P>The next Kingdom is <HI>Alaba,</HI> conterminous Easterly to <HI>Cam∣bat;</HI> the Governour of which, in the Sixteenth Year of this Century was call'd <HI>Alico.</HI> To the East, <HI>Habessinia</HI> is bound∣ed by vast Deserts, and open Solitary level Wildernesses, and therefore altogether unknown. Southward, it joyns to the Kingdom of <HI>Sennar</HI> or <HI>Fund,</HI> Govern'd by its peculiar King, formerly a Tributary to the <HI>Abessines,</HI> but now Absolute. He Possest a part of the ancient <HI>Nubia,</HI> near to which ad∣joyn'd the Kingdom of <HI>Balou,</HI> whose Inhabitants are by the <HI>Portugueses</HI> call'd <HI>Balous:</HI> their King was formerly Lord of <HI>Suaqena,</HI> and in friendship with the <HI>Abessines;</HI> now he only receives the half of the Maritine Tribute from the <HI>Turks.</HI> From what we have said, it may be easily gathered, with how many Adversaries and Enemies <HI>Ethiopia</HI> is sur∣rounded; so that the <HI>Abersines</HI> may not improperly com∣pare their Country to the Flower of Saffron <HI>Denguelat,</HI> set about with Thorns. For being perpetually struggling with their Foes, they rather apply themselves to the Arts of War, then Peace; which seldom thrive amidst the Noise of War and public Contention.</P>

<P>It remains to speak of the <HI>Portugals</HI> in <HI>Habessinia,</HI> who are neither <HI>Africans</HI> nor Forreiners; for that some time since they have submitted themselves to the <HI>Habessine</HI> Jurisdicti∣on. For of the Four hundred, which <HI>Christopher Gamez</HI> brought to the succour of the <HI>Abissines</HI> in the <HI>Adelan</HI> War, about One hundred and seventy superviving, in the space of one Age multiply'd so fast, that when the Fathers of the Society came thither, they were able to Muster Fourteen hundred

Fighting men: a small handful, but very considerable to the Party to which they adhere, as retaining their ancient Cou∣rage and dexterity in handling their Arms; for the use of Fire-arms superiour to the <HI>Habessines</HI> or any of the <HI>Barba∣rians.</HI></P>
<P>When the War with the <HI>Adelenses</HI> was ended and <HI>Grainus</HI> slain; having certain Lands and Possessions granted them by <HI>Claudius,</HI> they chose themselves Wives, got Children, and be∣ing furnish'd after the manner of the Country with Mules and Servants and other necessaries, began to live comfortably; for while the success of their assistance was fresh in memo∣ry they were courted, and every where kindly entertained, and had the free liberty of their Religion: but these Pri∣viledges were abridg'd by <HI>Menas</HI> successor to <HI>Claudius.</HI> They impatiently brook'd to see their kindness so ungratefully re∣talliated; it being the nature of Soldiers rather to do, than receive injuries. However, their Lands were taken away, (for jealousie began to Rule) or else exchang'd for worse, and those bordering upon the Enemy; so that at length the Kings of <HI>Portugal</HI> were forc'd to allow them Twelve hundred Patacks a year to maintain them. In this last Century while the Fathers of the Society flourish'd they wanted for nothing, but liv'd in great Prosperity: but the Fathers losing their Credit, they were again reduc'd to the extremity of Misery. So that it was the fear of <HI>Mendez,</HI> lest in that miserable Poverty, forgetful of their Native Language and their An∣cestors, they should revolt to the Religion and Customs of the <HI>Habessines.</HI></P>

<HI>John</HI> the Second pursuing, to bring the Discovery to Perfecti∣on, sent two <HI>Portugueses,</HI> Skilful in the Arabic Language, <HI>Peter Covillian,</HI> and <HI>Alphonsus Payva,</HI> to try what they could do; among other things, giving them more especially in charge, to find out that so much celebrated <HI>Presbyter John,</HI> that most wealthy King as he was reputed, either in <HI>Asia</HI> or <HI>India,</HI> hoping easily to obtain a League and Friendship with him, as a Chri∣stian Prince. They Travell'd through <HI>Egypt</HI> several ways in∣to <HI>India,</HI> and after a long and vain Search for <HI>Prester John, Pay∣va</HI> came home; but <HI>Peter</HI> more inquisitive, at length in some of the Ports of the Red Sea, heard much talk of a most Potent Christian King of the <HI>Abessines,</HI> that us'd to carry a Cross in his Hands; as also of his Subjects, who were great Favourers if not Followers of the Christian Religion. Believing it therefore to be of little moment whether this famous Mo∣narch liv'd in <HI>Asia</HI> or in <HI>Africa,</HI> he certainly perswaded himself, as being Ignorant both in History and Geography that this was the Prince so much sought after; and there∣upon gave Intelligence thereof to his own King, while he himself continu'd his Journey into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> with a resolu∣tion to take a view of this Celebrated <HI>Presbyter</HI> Emperor, who was look't upon as another Pope. These glad Tidings the <HI>Portugals</HI> sooner believ'd, than consider'd; and so spread the News all over <HI>Europe</HI> for real Truth; Credulity gaining easily upon those that are ignorant of Foreign Affairs and Kingdoms. And now the Learned Men began to enquire into the Cause and Original of this same Appellation. As it is the Custom generally to search for true Originals of feigned Names, and wrest them after a strange manner to make good their own Opinions.</P>
<P>We find among the most Eminent Historians, that for∣merly there was a certain Christian Prince, that reign'd in the utmost Parts of <HI>Asia,</HI> not far from the Kingdom of <HI>Tenduc</HI> toward<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The most Skilful Geographers teach us, That <HI>Cataya</HI> is no peculiar Kingdom, but a Part of North <HI>China.</HI> See <HI>Newhostus</HI>'s China Embassy.</NOTE> <HI>Cataya;</HI> who being of great Power and Fame, was by the Neighbouring <HI>Persians,</HI> to signifie his remar∣kable Sanctity, call'd <HI>Prester-Chan,</HI> or Prince of the Adorers; that is to say, Christians; or as <HI>Scaliger</HI> will have it, <HI>Friste∣giani,</HI> the <HI>Apostolic</HI> Prince. However the Name is to be pro∣nounc'd, we shall not contend; but this is certain, that the
<PB N="153" REF="63"/>
unskilful Vulgar having learnt the Name from the <HI>Italians,</HI> who at that time were great Traders into the <HI>East,</HI> call'd him by the <HI>Italian</HI> Name of <HI>Preste,</HI> or <HI>Pretegianni</HI> or <HI>Giovanni:</HI> after which, the same Name prevail'd with all the People of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Thus his Name and his Fame continued for some Ages, though under much obscurity. For few understood, that that same Asiatic <HI>Prester Chan</HI> was<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Scal.</HI> in his Notes ad <HI>Comp. Ethiop.</HI> but by what Authority he writes that the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> were beaten out of <HI>Asia</HI> by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> I cannot apprehend.</NOTE> driven out of his Kingdom by <HI>Cenchi</HI> or <HI>Cynges,</HI> King of the <HI>Tartars.</HI> There∣fore for this reason, because the <HI>Portugueses</HI> were greatly mi∣staken, first in the Name, and secondly, in the thing it self; that Name was given to this <HI>African</HI> King, which belong'd to a King reigning some Ages since in <HI>Asia,</HI> some Thousands of Miles distance.</P>
<P>Now after this <HI>Sir-name</HI> prevail'd among the <HI>Habessinians,</HI> and yet there could be found no Cause or Signification of the same, they began to find out<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">In the Itineracie of <HI>Hierome Wolsus.</HI></NOTE> words Foreign, and al∣together from the purpose to uphold their own Vanity, as <HI>Gian-Belul, Beldigian, Tarasta Gian:</HI> one among the rest super-exquisitely Critical, perswading himself that <HI>Prete-Janni</HI> was faulty, would have it to be <HI>Pretious-John,</HI> as a Title more becoming the Person of a King. This Epithete the Pope once assum'd, and that he might not be thought to be in an Error, many there were that obstinately maintain'd it;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>l.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 2.</NOTE> so that <HI>Tellezius</HI> had much ado to instruct them better. It would be too tedious to rehearse the Originals of these Chi∣mera's: only we must take notice of this by the way, that <HI>Beldi-gian,</HI> and <HI>Taras-ta-gian</HI> were the figments of Men of no Credit; but <HI>Gian-Belul</HI> derives its Original from the Cries of Petitioners, with which they address themselves to the King. But setting aside all these idle Derivations, and Surmises, which are ridiculous even to the more ingenious sort of <HI>Habessines</HI> themselves, most certain it is, that the Name of the King of the <HI>Habessines</HI> is no more in the <HI>E∣thiopic</HI> Language than <HI>Negus, King;</HI> But in the Titles which both he himself, and all the <HI>Habessines</HI> use, he is call'd <HI>Negusa Nagast</HI><NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Erroneously</HI> Nuguca Nagasta <HI>in</HI> Tellezius, <HI>l.</HI> 1. <HI>c.</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 5.</NOTE> <HI>Zaitjopia;</HI> King of the Kings of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI>

in Reference to some Rulers of Provinces, and Viceroys that are under him, who are also dignified with the Title of <HI>Ne∣gus,</HI> or <HI>Nagash.</HI> In the <HI>Amharic</HI> Dialect he is saluted <HI>Hatzeghe,</HI> which they render <HI>Supream Prince;</HI> and given to none but to the Prince, as the <HI>French</HI> in their Address use the word <HI>Sir.</HI> Hence the <HI>Arabian</HI> word <HI>Aticlabassi,</HI> or as <HI>Ortelius</HI> pronounces it, <HI>Asiclabassi;</HI> compounded from the foremention'd word, <HI>Hatzeghe,</HI> the <HI>Arabic</HI> Article <HI>El,</HI> and the National name <HI>Habesh, Hatzeg-el-Habesh;</HI> or Supream Prince of the <HI>Ha∣bessines.</HI> When they add the Proper Name, they cut the word short, <HI>Hatzè,</HI> as <HI>Hatzè-Susneus, Hatze-Jacob; Hatze-Basilides.</HI> The <HI>Persians</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> honour him with the Title of <HI>Pade∣shah,</HI> which is given to none but the greatest Kings in the Empire; as to our <HI>German</HI> Empire; the Kings of <HI>India, Per∣sia, Turky,</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> who have several Governours and Prin∣ces under their Subjection, which the common People call Emperors; and as this King by <HI>Tellez</HI> is call'd in the <HI>Portugal</HI> Language, <HI>O Emperador Abexim,</HI> Emperor of the <HI>Abessines:</HI> which his Title seems to Intimate, in regard a King of Kings may not unproperly be call'd an Emperor. Neither shall we derogate in the least from his Title, as being so highly Eminent above all the Barbarous Kings of <HI>Africa,</HI> both for his Power, and the Honour of being a Christian. Among the Ancient <HI>Arabians,</HI> the Kings were always call'd <HI>Na∣jashi,</HI> as the Kings of<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pharao</HI> in the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Language signifies a King, <HI>Joseph.</HI> L. <HI>8.</HI> c. <HI>5.</HI> al. c. <HI>2. Bochart in Hieroz,</HI> P. II. L. V.</NOTE> <HI>Aegypt</HI> were call'd <HI>Pharo</HI>'s; and the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors <HI>Caesars.</HI> But as to the Proper Name of the King; it was the ancient Custom, that at his first com∣ing to the Crown, he was saluted by the Souldiery with a new Name, for lucks sake; and generally the change was made of the Christian Name. However they do not cast it quite off, as the Popes do, but assume both together. Thus <HI>Zar-a-Jacob</HI> in an Epistle to the Tome of Councils, writes himself <HI>Zar-a-Jacob,</HI> and our <HI>Imperial,</HI> or <HI>Inaugura∣tion</HI> Name <HI>Constantine.</HI> This Name design'd for a good Omen, generally signifies Reverence and Veneration, as <HI>Atznaf-Saghed;</HI> Venerable to the Ends of the Earth; <HI>Melec-Saghed,</HI> a venerable Ruler. Sometimes they take the Names of Gems; as <HI>Adamas-Saghed,</HI> the venerable Diamond. <HI>Encua-Saghed,</HI> or <HI>Wanag-Saghed,</HI> a Precious Gemm. This was the
<PB N="105" REF="64"/>
Name of <HI>David,</HI> the Son of <HI>Naod,</HI> the Father of <HI>Claudius.</HI> Whence I believe it came to pass, that his Embassador <HI>Tzaga∣zaabus,</HI> being sent into <HI>Portugal,</HI> call'd him <HI>Pretious John,</HI> instead of <HI>Prete-Gianni,</HI> as judging that the Person could not but be precious, that bare the Name of a Precious Gem. Sometimes several Names, and those variously pronounc'd are clapp'd together. For that same <HI>David,</HI> besides the two Names already mention'd, was Baptiz'd <HI>Etana Denghel, The Virgins Incense;</HI> or as others will have it, <HI>Lebna Denghel,</HI> The Virgins <HI>Storax.</HI> But this multitude and variety of Names often renders the History imperfect, while many times that is spoken of many Persons, which should be only said of one. Thus that famous King <HI>Caleb,</HI> that ruin'd the Kingdom of the <HI>Homerites,</HI> was by the Greeks call'd <HI>Elesbaas.</HI></P>
<P>The King's Seal which they use in Sealing their Letters, is a Lion holding a Cross, with this Motto: <HI>The Lion of the Tribe of</HI> Juda <HI>has won.</HI></P>
<P>Ridiculous therefore are those Arms which are set forth by a certain <HI>French</HI> Author in the Fabulous History of <HI>Tzagaxi,</HI> and which the Impostor himself assum'd in his Epistles to <HI>John Wisling,</HI> a Physitian of <HI>Padua.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>David</HI>'s Titles which are vulgarly published, are very tedious and corrupted; but here by us amended.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> Etana Denghel, <HI>The Virgins Incense, by my Name in Bap∣tism; by my Inauguration Name call'd</HI> David, <HI>beloved of God, the Pillar of Faith, descended from the Tribe of</HI> Judah, <HI>the Son of</HI> David, <HI>the Son of</HI> Salomon, <HI>the Son of the Pillar of</HI> Sion, (Amda Tzeonis) <HI>The Son of the seed of</HI> Jacob, Zar-a-Jacob. <HI>The Son of the hand of</HI> Mary (Baeda-Mariami) <HI>the Son of</HI> Nahu, <HI>or</HI> Naod, <HI>according to the Flesh.</HI> Here some have interlarded (<HI>The Son of St.</HI> Peter <HI>and</HI> Paul, <HI>according to Grace</HI>) that there might be something to oppose the Flesh. <HI>Emperor of the Upper and Lower</HI> Ethiopia, <HI>and of many other Kingdoms and Provinces; King of</HI> Shoa, Gafata, Fategara, Angota, Bara, Dawara, Hadea, Bali, Ganza, Vanga, Gojam, <HI>where are the Fountains of</HI> Nile, Amhara, Bagemdra, Dembea, Vagna, Tigra, Sabaim, <HI>whence the Queen of</HI> Sheba, <HI>Midre Bahr,</HI> &amp;c. Methinks I am now writing out not the <HI>Abessine,</HI> but the long Scroll of <HI>Russian</HI> Ostentation. But the <HI>Portugals</HI> taking the Advantage of the <HI>Abessine</HI> Simplicie, swell'd up this Title for them, or else over-perswaded the <HI>Habessines</HI> to
<PB N="156" REF="65"/>
do it themselves, that after the <HI>European</HI> manner, their Epi∣stles, which <HI>Alvarez</HI> was to <HI>(g)</HI> carry to the Pope and the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> might render his Negotiation more for∣midable and magnificent. For neither before nor after did the Letters which the <HI>Habessinian</HI> Kings sent to the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> appear with any such tumid Style or ostentatious Lof∣tiness.</P>
<P>The first Letter from <HI>Helena</HI> brought by <HI>Matthew</HI> into <HI>Por∣tugal,</HI> began with onely a bare Salutation without any Title; to omit the false and forgotten names of Kingdoms in those other forged Titles. Again, how nonsensical it is for a Prince to mention such an uncertainty as the Queen of <HI>Sheba's</HI> Coun∣try, or the Fountains of <HI>Nile</HI> among the Titles of his Empire? as if the Fountains of <HI>Nile</HI> were such a Miracle to the <HI>Abes∣sines,</HI> as they were to the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Latines.</HI> What a pleasant thing it would be if any one should add to our Emperour's Titles, the Fountains of the <HI>Danaw</HI> in the Dukedom of <HI>Schaw∣ben,</HI> which were also unknown to the ancient Philosophers? How idly are those proper names of <HI>Son of the Pillar of Sion; Son of the Seed of Jacob; Son of the hand of Mary,</HI> turn'd into Appellatives? Then for <HI>Naod, Alvarez</HI> reads <HI>Nabu;</HI> which makes me believe him to be the Author of that surreptitious Title; because he mistakes the word all along in his Itinera∣rie. But to insist no longer upon these figments, the Genu∣ine stile of the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Letters, which was made known and attested to me by <HI>Gregorie</HI> is also to be found in <HI>Tellezius,</HI> where the King writing to the Pope, uses only this Introduction;</P>
<P><HI>Let the little book of the Letter from</HI> Malec-Saghed, <HI>King of the Kings of</HI> Ethiopia <HI>come to the hands of the Holy Roman Patri∣arch.</HI></P>
<P>In the same manner, writing to the King of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the <HI>Salomonean</HI> Family, which is said to have its Original from <HI>Menile-heck</HI> the Queen of <HI>She∣ba's</HI> Son, who came to visit <HI>Salomon.</HI></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The <HI>Ethiopians</HI> derive their Kings from the Queen of <HI>Sheba.</HI> The relations of <HI>Tellez</HI> and <HI>Josephus:</HI> Both reconcil'd. The Tradition of the <HI>Arabians:</HI> Their Contention with the <HI>Abessines.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE find in Sacred Writt (that we may begin at the Fountain of <HI>Antiquity</HI>) that the Queen of <HI>Sheba</HI> came to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to hear and behold the Wisdom of <HI>Salo∣mon,</HI> and that she brought along with her, precious Gifts, as Gemms, Gold, and Spices. Our Saviour tells us, A Queen of the South, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that came from the ends of the Earth to hear the Wisdom of <HI>Salomon.</HI> The <HI>Ethiopic</HI> version renders the <HI>Queen of the South Nagasta-Azeb,</HI><NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tellez</HI> erroneously takes <HI>Azeb</HI> for a proper name, <HI>p.</HI> 63.</NOTE> <HI>which signi∣fies the same thing.</HI></P>
<P>Her therefore the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> assert to be their Queen; and have her History written at large, but mix'd with sundry Fa∣bles. We shall transcribe the Summ of it out of <HI>Tellez,</HI> who saith, <HI>That the Queen of</HI> Ethiopia <HI>Maqueda,</HI> understanding from her Merchant <HI>Tamerin</HI> the certainty of the Report which had bin spread abroad concerning the great Power and Wis∣dom of <HI>Salomon,</HI> with a great train of her Nobility, and Royal
<PB N="159" REF="66"/>
presents gave him an Interview at his own Court; where she learnt from him the true Worship of God: And at her return, after a certain space of time she brought forth her Son <HI>Menilehec</HI> begot by <HI>Salomon,</HI> and whom he had nam'd <HI>David.</HI> This young Prince was afterwards sent to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> to his Father, where by his order and care he was Exactly instruct∣ed in the Law of God. Being grown up, he was anointed King of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> and sent back into his own Kingdom, ac∣company'd with several noble <HI>Israelites</HI> and Doctors of the Law, who were joyn'd with him, as Friends and Compani∣ons, and Ministers of State; among the rest went also <HI>Aza∣ria,</HI> the Son of <HI>Zadoc</HI> the High Priest. And this is that Prince from whom all the <HI>Habessine</HI> Kings and the chiefest of the Nobility derive their Pedegrees to this day.</P>
<P>But then follows a Tale no less insipid, then misbecoming the new King. <HI>That these noble Jews, nefariously and Sacrilegiously took away with them the Ark of the Covenant, together with the Tables of the Ten Commandements, the Temple being carelesly lookt after, and the Gates being left open as it were by the Providence of God.</HI> Pre∣sently the Mother, upon his return, resign'd her Kingdom to her Son <HI>David,</HI> obliging him and all the Nobility of the Na∣tion, That they should never for the future admit a Woman to rule over them; but onely males of the Line of <HI>David.</HI></P>
<P>But it has bin the Long and Serious Enquiry of the An∣cients, of what Countrey and of what Progenie this same Queen of <HI>Sheba</HI> was. <HI>Josephus,</HI> while he writes the Antiqui∣ties of the <HI>Jews,</HI> an Author not to be contemn'd; tho in For∣raign matters not so well vers'd, affirms her to be one <HI>Ni∣caule,</HI> mentioned hy <HI>Herodotus.</HI> And yet in the Modern Edi∣tions of <HI>Herodotus,</HI> there is no such Name to be found, unless she should be the same whom he calls <HI>Nitocris.</HI> That <HI>Nicaule,</HI> according to <HI>Josephus,</HI> was not onely Queen of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> but of <HI>Egypt;</HI> in which 'tis to be fear'd he is foully mistaken. However, that she came out of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> many of the An∣cients agree, as <HI>Origen, Austin,</HI> and <HI>Anselm,</HI> whom Cardinal <HI>Toletus Cites.</HI> Others on the contrary, declare her to have come out of <HI>Arabia,</HI> as <HI>Justin, Cyprian, Epiphanius, Cyril, Alexan∣drinus,</HI> Cardinal <HI>Baronius, Suarez, Lorinus,</HI> and at large <HI>Pineda</HI> in his Treatise of the Acts of <HI>Salomon;</HI> where he labours by ten Reasons to confirm his Opinion. Of which, those that seem to carry most weight are these: <HI>That</HI> Saba <HI>is seated in</HI> Arabia <HI>to the South of</HI> Judea. <HI>That Camels, Spice, Gemms and
<PB N="160" REF="67"/>
Gold are more consistent with</HI> Arabia <HI>than with</HI> Ethiopia. But these different Opinions are easily reconcil'd; if as many of the Old Writers held, the ancient <HI>Ethiopia</HI> extended it self into <HI>Arabia.</HI> For they assert the <HI>Sabeans</HI> and <HI>Homerites</HI> to have bin Nations of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> which without question were formerly seated in <HI>Arabia the Happy.</HI> That Region which the <HI>Hebrews</HI> call by the Name, of <HI>Cush,</HI> by the 70 Interpreters is rendred <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> From hence <HI>Moses</HI> chose his Wife, who is call'd the <HI>Ethiopess;</HI> and yet that County is a part of <HI>Arabia,</HI> according to the Common acceptation now a days, whence the <HI>Arabians</HI> are call'd <HI>Cushites.</HI> Therefore was the <HI>Ethiopia</HI> of the Ancients two-fold, <HI>Asiatic</HI> and <HI>African,</HI> or Oriental and Western. For the Ancients did not limit the principal Parts of the World as we do now; while they extended <HI>India</HI> into <HI>Africa,</HI> and brought <HI>Ethiopia</HI> into <HI>Asia,</HI> and believed that the <HI>Indians</HI> inha∣bited beyond the <HI>Ethiopians.</HI> Nor did they think that <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> were distinct parts of the Orbe of the Earth, but onely particular Regions. <HI>Egypt</HI> seemed to belong some∣times to <HI>Asia,</HI> sometimes to <HI>Africa;</HI> and others made <HI>Nilus,</HI> to be the bounds between those two Continents. And, which is most remarkable, the Antient <HI>Arabia</HI> was not of so large an Extent, as now the Modern is. For the <HI>Sabeans</HI> and <HI>Home∣rites</HI> were plac'd beyond the Limits of <HI>Arabia.</HI> The <HI>Arabian</HI> Gulph was also taken onely for a part or Bay of the Red Sea. All which things the Geographers of later Times have much more distinctly reform'd. So that altho by Us, the <HI>Sa∣beans</HI> are accounted to be a Region of the Southern <HI>Arabia</HI> that lyes upon the <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean, and consequently toward the utmost Limits of Land there, yet may the Queen of <HI>Sheba,</HI> according to the Opinion of the Ancients, be said to come out of <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> Nor does it argue any thing of absurdity to con∣jecture that she might at the same time command that part of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> which lay upon the Opposite Shore, and at so near a distance.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arabians</HI> made no question, but that she was descen∣ded from the Line of the Sons of <HI>Homer,</HI> or the <HI>Homerites,</HI> and that she was the daughter<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">He was the twenty first, as is to be seen in the Catalogue of the <HI>Home∣rite</HI> King, which the learned Pocock set forth in his Specimen of an <HI>Arabian</HI> History <HI>p.</HI> 59.</NOTE> of King <HI>Hod-hadi,</HI> They call her <HI>Belkis,</HI> and affirm her to have bin, not the Concubine,

but the<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Anubian</HI> Geographer, speaking of the City <HI>Mareb,</HI> There, saith he, was <HI>Belkis</HI> born, the Wife of <HI>Salomon</HI> the Son of <HI>David.</HI></NOTE> wife of <HI>Salomon:</HI> from whence we gather, that they themselves believ'd that Tradition to be true, that she had a Son begotten by <HI>Salomon.</HI> The <HI>Arabs</HI> and <HI>Ethiopians</HI> con∣tend about this, to this very day, as if the Modern Franks should contend with the <HI>Germans</HI> about <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Great. Al∣phonsus Mendez</HI> the Patriarch adheres to the Tradition of the <HI>Abessines,</HI><NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">In his Epistle to <HI>Tellez us.</HI></NOTE> mov'd thereto by these Arguments: because the continuation of Officers both Civil and Military, and o∣ther customes and Ceremonies made use of in the Hebrew Common-wealth so long since, are still observ'd there to this day. So that <HI>Ethiopia</HI> seem'd to him to be a certain live∣ly representation of the Ancient Hebrew Government. And his other reason was, for that he understood many places of Scripture much better since he came into <HI>Ethiopia. Tellezi∣us,</HI> none of the mildest Censurers of the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Traditions, in this thing, agrees throughout with the Patriarch, adding, That it ought to seem strange to no Person, that <HI>Salomon,</HI> who took to wife the Daughter of <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> and also lov'd the <HI>Mo∣abitish, Idumean, Sidonian</HI> and <HI>Hethic</HI> Women, should desire to tast the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Variety. The <HI>Habessines</HI> also call'd the Po∣sterity of their Kings <HI>Israelites:</HI> neither do they think any other persons worthy of the Scepter but the Male Issue of <HI>Menilehec;</HI> who for that reason bear the Lyon in their Royal Coats, with this Imprese, <HI>The Lyon of the Tribe of</HI> Judah <HI>has overcome:</HI> to demonstrate that they are descended from the Tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> and the Line of <HI>David:</HI> nor that <HI>Candaces</HI> Eu∣nuch learnt the Orthodox Religion from any other then from the <HI>Israelites. Gregory</HI> also averr'd to me the same things, and that the Book wherein those things were record∣ed, was call'd the <HI>Glory of the Kings,</HI> and was of great autho∣rity among them; and that no person in <HI>Ethiopia</HI> doubted of the Truth thereof. He added, That all the Offices, both Civil and Military, of which the Patriarch discourses in his Letter, <HI>(q)</HI> are still continu'd in the same Families, and that they who Enjoy them, can make it appear how long those Employments have been officiated by their Ancestors, from Generation to Generation. However, I do not think it con∣venient,
<PB N="162" REF="68"/>
to augment or lessen the Credit of these things, un∣till those <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Institutions, Offices, Customs and Manners, of which the Patriarch speaks in general, shall be more parti∣cularly made known to me; that I see the Genealogies of those public Ministers, whom <HI>Gregory</HI> mentions; and that I hear the answers to such doubts as I shall propose. I find in∣deed the Consent of the Nation, and the affirmation of their Kings; for <HI>Claudius</HI> calls his Ancestors <HI>Israelitish Kings:</HI> and at the time of Inauguration, they proclaim the Creation of the <HI>Israelitish King:</HI> and they who are kept in the Rock <HI>Geshen,</HI> bear the Name of <HI>Israelites:</HI> And lastly, I find some Rites and Customs agreeing with those of the <HI>Jews.</HI> Nor is it any wonder to me more than to <HI>Tellezius,</HI> or disagreeable from <HI>Salomon</HI>'s practice, that after so many profound and knotty Riddles unloos'd, he should unty the Queen of <HI>Sheba's</HI> Mar∣riage Girdle. Again, if the <HI>Habessines</HI> are Colonies of the <HI>Sabeans</HI> and <HI>Homerites,</HI> it may as well be granted that the <HI>Queen of the South</HI> deriv'd her Pedigree from them. Yet there are many things that seem to perswade the contrary. For as to the <HI>Israelitish Rites,</HI> we shall hereafter shew, that they might have bin introduc'd long after <HI>Salomon</HI>'s time upon other grounds; and that they were common as well to the Gentiles as to the Christians. For if the true Worship of God began from that time, how came it to be preserv'd without Synagogues, and the Sacred Volumes? But they have them not, either in the Hebrew Language, nor translated into their own. Nor does the Appellation of <HI>Israelitish Kings,</HI> argue the Verity of their Descent, no more than if any one should assert our Emperours descended from the Ancient <HI>Romans.</HI> But if, as the Posterity of the <HI>Israelites</HI> they continue in their Offices, or are so sollicitous to preserve their Posterity; why not as well in preserving the Histories of their Ancestors? and in perpetuating Kindnesses between their Relations and those of the same Tribe or Family? why not more choice in their Marriages? more earnest in Visiting the Temple of <HI>Jerusalem?</HI> and in giving mutual assistance to their Brethren? Especially when <HI>Rehoboam</HI> the Brother of <HI>Menehelec,</HI> suffer'd that great Loss of the revolt of the Ten Tribes? and when he was in∣vaded by <HI>Sisack</HI> King of <HI>Egypt,</HI> whom no man better than the King of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> could have diverted? when the <HI>Jews</HI> were oppress'd by so many Enemies; when they were carry'd away Captive to <HI>Babylon?</HI> when ruin'd by the Kings of <HI>Assyria?</HI> and
<PB N="163" REF="68"/>
when subdu'd by the <HI>Romans?</HI> For then the Passages were free thorough <HI>Arabia</HI> or <HI>Egypt;</HI> and the <HI>Red Sea</HI> was open. Lastly, which is of most moment, if the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> receiv'd their divine Ceremonies and Religion from <HI>Salomon,</HI> why not his human Learning? For Learning and Religion generally go together, as may be prov'd by the Examples of many Nations. But as to this, their manner of writing and read∣ing differs very much, though some of their letters seem to be borrow'd from the <HI>Samaritans.</HI> Lastly, the <HI>Jews</HI> inhabit∣ing up and down all over <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> it would be of great Con∣cern to put these Questions to them, When? and how they came thither? What they think of these Traditions of the <HI>Habissines?</HI> and what they find in their Books concerning them? it not being probable that all their Books should be lost in a Country so well defended by nature? But we have made too long a Digression: now let us return to <HI>Meni∣lehec.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> of <HI>Menilehec,</HI> the Son of <HI>Makeda,</HI> and of his Poste∣rity, to the interrupted Succession of the <HI>Salomo∣nians.</HI></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Menilehec</HI> first King; the interpretation of his name: nothing certain of his Son or Posterity. Christ born in the Reign of <HI>Bazen.</HI> No mention here of Queen <HI>Candaces.</HI> She reign'd in <HI>Meroe,</HI> not in <HI>Habessinia.

The Subversion of the King∣dom of the <HI>Homerites</HI> by <HI>Caleb.</HI> He restores <HI>Nagra</HI> to the Christians. His Successors: <HI>Saif-ibn-de-Jazan</HI> advanced by the <HI>Persians;</HI> Slain. <HI>Bazen</HI> the last, submits to the <HI>Mahumetans.</HI> The <HI>Greek</HI> Histories Con∣fused: <HI>Caleb's</HI> Encomium. The Martyrdom of the <HI>Nagranites. Caleb's</HI> Successors: The <HI>Salomonean</HI> Line interrupted.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NOW then they acknowledg <HI>Menilehec-El-Haqim</HI> to be the first King. Which name some interpret, <HI>As He.</HI> Others, <HI>As God created him like me.</HI> Neither of which interpretations can be pick'd from the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Language. However, <HI>Ebn-El-Haqim,</HI> is apparently in Arabic the <HI>Son of Wisdome,</HI> or of <HI>Salomon. Tellezius</HI> gives to his Son the name of <HI>Zadgur;</HI> whereas <HI>Gedur,</HI> in <HI>Marianus Victor</HI>'s Catalogue pre∣cedes
<PB N="164" REF="69"/>
Queen <HI>Makeda.</HI> Then, saith he, four and twenty Kings succeeded, till <HI>Bazen</HI> reign'd; and yet in the next Chapter, writes him to be the Twentieth from <HI>Menihelec</HI> the Son of <HI>Salomon:</HI> but neither does he name them, neither will we de∣tain the Reader amidst these uncertainties.</P>
<P>There is less doubt, that Christ our Saviour was born in the time of <HI>Bazen,</HI> more particularly in the Eighteenth Year of his Reign. Here is no mention made of <HI>Candaces,</HI> whom some of the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> acknowledg for their Queen: in this contradictory to themselves, while they will not ad∣mit a Female to the Throne. And therefore it is more pro∣per, that we should in expounding that place in the <HI>Acts, c.</HI> 8. <HI>v.</HI> 27. which speaks of the Queen of <HI>Ethiopia's</HI> Eunuch, find out some other more probable part of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> bordering upon <HI>Aegypt:</HI> which with some probability we may conjecture to be the Island of <HI>Meroe;</HI> in regard that <HI>Pliny</HI> testifies, That in that Iland reign'd a Certain Woman call'd <HI>Candace,</HI> and that the succeeding Queens assum'd that name afterwards for ma∣ny Years. After <HI>Bazen,</HI> for the space of 327 Years <HI>Ethiopia</HI> was govern'd by Thirteen Kings, as <HI>Tellezius</HI> records it. But he mentions not one of their names, perhaps because he found there was nothing of certainty. From the time that<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">Abreha is an <HI>Arabic</HI> word, contractedly spoken. <HI>Abra:</HI> Erroneously taken for <HI>Abraham,</HI> which they pronounce <HI>Ibrahim.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Abreha,</HI> and <HI>Atzbeha</HI> held the Scepter, the Ethiopic History has afforded much more clearness and light, and the names of the Kings are more certainly recited. Of these and several other Successive Kings, there is mention made in the Ethiopic Liturgy, and otherwhere. For in <HI>their Commemoration of the Dead,</HI> there is this Ejaculation,
<Q>Remenber, Lord, <HI>Abreha,</HI> and <HI>Atzbeha,</HI> Kings of <HI>Ethiopia.</HI></Q>
My Ethiopic Poet also gives them this Encomium.</P>
<Q><L>Peace be to <HI>Abreha.</HI> and <HI>Atzbeha,</HI></L>
<L>They in one Kingdom did the Scepter sway;</L>
<L>And yet in Love, and yet in Concord still,</L>
<L>They liv'd as Princes with one Heart and Will;</L>
<L><PB N="165" REF="69"/>Like those good Men, that with Religious awe</L>
<L>Walk'd in the Precepts of <HI>Mosaic</HI> Law,</L>
<L>Their Lipps the words of Christ's own Gospel taught;</L>
<L>To build him Temples with their hands they wrought.</L></Q>
<P>They are applauded for their Concord; rare among Bro∣thers, who are partners in Royalty; yet that it may so hap∣pen, is clear by that great Sentence, <HI>A Kingdom may endure Col∣legues in Kingship, so They can but endure themselves.</HI> But much more were they to be Extoll'd, for embracing the Christian Reli∣gion, at what time <HI>Frumentius</HI> Preach'd; of which more in due place. But more then this, the <HI>Habessines</HI> give us an∣other Example of a Concording and Unanimous <HI>Triumvirate.</HI> These Royal <HI>Triumvers</HI> were <HI>Atzfa, Atzfed,</HI> and <HI>Amey,</HI> who govern'd the Empire long and prosperously by turns, as they agreed. A thing which the <HI>Habessines</HI> will hardly perswade most people to believe; unless it were in reference to the hearing such businesses as afterwards requir'd common Con∣sultation, or the executing such Decrees as were made by Common Consent; tho in such Transactions likewise there must be harmony and agreement. To them succeeded <HI>Arado; Aladoba</HI> and <HI>Alamid,</HI> at what time several Monks went out of <HI>Aegypt</HI> into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> to propagate the Gospel. To <HI>Alamid</HI> succeeded his Son <HI>Tacena,</HI> and after him <HI>Caleb</HI> his Nephew, who flourished in the time of the Emperour <HI>Justin,</HI> about the Year 522. The Greek and Latin Authors call him <HI>Eles baan:</HI> Perhaps from the Ethiopic name of Baptisme, <HI>Atzbeha,</HI> with the Arabic article <HI>El. El-Atzbeha,</HI> from whence <HI>Eles baas.</HI> He was famous for the Subversion of the Kingdom of the <HI>Ho∣merites,</HI> and revenging the blood of the Christians slain by that Impious <HI>Dunawas:</HI> for which he was placed in the Kalendar of the Saints. It is a Story most worthy remembrance; wherein the Arabic and Ethiopic Historians very punctually agree with the Greeks and Latins.

For he caus'd large Pitts to be digg'd, and then commanded the Christians

And thus this Kingdom harrass'd with continual Wars between the <HI>Persians</HI> and the <HI>Habessines,</HI> at length, when the <HI>Saracens</HI> began to grow powerful, under <HI>Bazen,</HI> the last King, became tributarie to <HI>Mahomet.</HI> And by this perhaps we are to understand what <HI>Abdelbachides</HI> writes concerning a <HI>Nagash</HI> of the <HI>Abessines,</HI> whom he calls <HI>Atzhama,</HI> as if he had revolted to <HI>Islamisin</HI> at the invitation of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> But these things are confused and imperfectly delivered by the <HI>Arabes, Greehes</HI> and <HI>Latins;</HI> and besides that, the diversity of names adds obscurity to the History. For as to those Acts which <HI>Pro∣copius</HI> attributes to <HI>Hellesthiaeus,</HI> King of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> as if he, ha∣ving slain the King of the <HI>Homerites,</HI> (of which many were Jews) set up another in his place, <HI>Emsiphaeus</HI> by name, and a Christian, those things are proper to none but <HI>Caleb:</HI> in re∣gard that Kingdom being destroy'd by <HI>Caleb,</HI> could not be again subverted by <HI>Ellesthiaeus.</HI> But as for those things which are reported by <HI>Cedrenus</HI> and <HI>Nicephorus</HI> of <HI>Adad</HI> or <HI>David,</HI> a certain <HI>Ethnic</HI> King of the <HI>Indian Axumites,</HI> who de∣molish'd the Kingdom of the <HI>Homerites,</HI> and by occasion of a former vow, became a Christian, they are altogether false. For that there is no other History than that which we have related of <HI>Caleb</HI> to this purpose, we shall hereafter

declare, when we came to discourse of the Original Christi∣anity in <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> For that the corrupt names of <HI>Damian,</HI> of <HI>Damnus,</HI> from <HI>Dunaam,</HI> or <HI>Dunawas,</HI> and other Circumstan∣ces demonstrate.

<P>Our Poet before cited thus praises <HI>Caleb</HI> in the following Lines.</P>
<Q><L>Peace be to <HI>Caleb,</HI> who with the Lawrel wreath'd;</L>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of the <HI>Zagaean</HI> Line, and the Kings that descended from that Race.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The <HI>Zagaean</HI> Line originally from the wickedness of a woman: the Suc∣cessors uncertain: yet some of them very Famous.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>UPon the Death of <HI>Delnoad,</HI> the <HI>Zagean</HI> Family invaded the Kingdom, and enjoy'd it Three Hundred and Forty years. They first obtain'd it by the devices of a wicked Woman.<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">The word signifies Fire.</NOTE> <HI>Essat</HI> by Name, Stigmatiz'd for Unchastity, Sacriledge, and Avarice in the highest degree. Her Successors are uncertain, and the Names which <HI>Marianus Victor</HI> produces, together with the several years of their Reigns are very much to be suspected; to omit what <HI>Tel∣lezius</HI> learnedly writes, <HI>That the Queens are never inserted in the Catalogues of those that Reign.</HI> Nevertheless, <HI>Victorius</HI> nomi∣nates one <HI>Tredda-Gadez,</HI> who Murder'd all the Posterity of the <HI>Salomonean Family,</HI> that he might Establish the Kingdom to his Son. Yet in the mid'st of the Slaughter, there was one young Lad of the Royal Blood, who making his Escape to the Lords of the Kingdom of <HI>Shewa,</HI> most passionately zealous for the <HI>Salomonean</HI> Line, was there privately preserv'd. The Kings of this Line are very enviously traduc'd by <HI>Telle∣zius</HI> as unjust, and unworthy to be remember'd; tho it has honour'd <HI>Ethiopia</HI> with many Renowned Monarchs: of whom there is still a happy Memorial both in the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Li∣turgy,
<PB N="169" REF="71"/>
and among the Encomiums of my Poet; as <HI>Degna Mi∣chael</HI> and <HI>Newaja-Christos,</HI> or the <HI>Wealth of Christ,</HI> who never appears in <HI>Victorius</HI>'s Catalogue: However he is thus Praised by the Poet.</P>
<Q><L>Peace to <HI>Newaja,</HI> from whose Royal Loins</L>
<L>Illustrious Princes born for high designs,</L>
<L>Ennobling more their high Descent, his Praise</L>
<L>Advanc'd, and thence their own Renown did raise.</L>
<L>No wonder he dy'd Poor; his Zeal was such</L>
<L>He stript himself, his Temple to enrich.</L>
<L>Himself had built the House of God, and scorn'd</L>
<L>To leave God's House behind him unadorn'd.</L></Q>
<P>But the most famous, and most renowned for his Magni∣ficent Structures was,<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Alvarez</HI> makes mention of him, <HI>c. 54. and 55.</HI> where he relates the same Story of the swarm of Bees.</NOTE> <HI>Lalibala,</HI> whose future Greatness was portended by a Swarm of Bees, that while he was an Infant newly born, lighted upon his tender Body, without doing him the least prejudice. Of him the Poet thus sings:
<Q><LG>
<L>To mighty <HI>Lalibala</HI> Peace,</L>
<L>Who stately Structures rear'd,</L>
<L>And to adorn the Pompous piles</L>
<L>For no Expences spar'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By vast Expence and hideous pains,</L>
<L>The Rock a Church became:</L>
<L>The Roof, the Floor, the squared Sides</L>
<L>All one continu'd Frame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No stones in blended Mortar lay'd</L>
<L>The solid parts divide;</L>
<L>Nature has carved all without,</L>
<L>Within the Workman's Pride.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But newly born, and hardly swath'd,</L>
<L>The tender Infant lay;</L>
<L>When strait a Wonder, that portends</L>
<L>The Honour of that day.</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>It was their Errand thus to shew</L>
<L>The grandeur of the Child;</L>
<L>That he should Conquer and Command,</L>
<L>And yet be wondrous mild.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That done, as if by sight the face</L>
<L>Of Majesty they knew,</L>
<L>With such a fear as aw'd their stings,</L>
<L>Away again they flew.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>This great Monarch when he came to Rule, sent for Artists out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and after a wonderful and unheard of manner of Building to that day, he did not cement Stones or Bricks together with Lime, or Lome, nor joyn the Roof together with Rafters, but hollow'd whole solid Rocks, leaving Pillars for Ornament where Pillars were requisite, the Arches and Walls being all of the same Stone. Nor do the Rocks of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> withstand that kind of Structure, for that most of them advance equilaterally toward the Sky, as if they had bin squar'd by Art; and besides, the Stone is so soft and tender, that the Tools of the Artists easily make their way. <HI>Alvarez</HI> gives an accompt of Ten Temples fram'd after this wonderful manner, which were Four and twenty years finishing. He saw them all, and gives you a draught of them in Picture, and lest any one should doubt of the Truth of what he says, he confirms his Relation with an Oath. This Magnificent King reign'd Forty years; and af∣ter him his Son <HI>Imra</HI> rul'd as many. The last of this Race was <HI>Naacueto-Laab.</HI> Of him the Poet thus,
<Q><L>Hail <HI>Naacueto-Laab,</HI> thy Renown</L>
<L>I sing, and all the Glories of thy Crown</L>
<L>In Peace and Love, which thou didst love, thy Raign</L>
<L>Concord and Peace did mutually sustain.</L>
<L>And thnt no fear of Death might him dismay,</L>

<P><HI>Amda-Tzejon</HI><NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">This Succession is taken out of <HI>Tellez,</HI> and agrees with the vulgar Order of the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Kings, which <HI>Gregory</HI> himself did not contradict. <HI>Alvarez</HI> here err'd very muth, or else forgot himself: for he apparently leaves out <HI>Ambda-Tzeon. c. 59.</HI> and makes <HI>Alexander</HI> the Father of <HI>Naod, c. 98. and 89.</HI> when he was really his Bro∣ther.

<PB N="173" REF="73"/>
<HI>Enkua-Saged,</HI> or the Precious Gem. He was the second Son of <HI>Naod</HI> by his Wife <HI>Mogesa,</HI> the Nephew of <HI>Baeda-Marjam.</HI> For the Eldest, whom <HI>Naod</HI> begat in the Rock of <HI>Amhanira, Helena</HI> and <HI>Marcus,</HI> the Metropolitan, who had then the Government in their hands, did not think worthy to Rule, by reason of his Pride and Cruelty; adding, That he was born when his Father was but in a private Capacity before he came to the Crown: unless it were, that they thought that they should carry a greater sway during the Minority of the young Prince. For then was <HI>David</HI> but Eleven years of Age; as he himself declares in his Letter to King <HI>E∣manuel.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Helena</HI> therefore his Grandmother, took upon her the Management of Affairs, as his Tut'ress, being preferr'd be∣fore the Mother; in regard the Junior Queens always give place to the Senior, and then too she is always look'd upon as the King's Mother. A Woman of great Prudence and Courage, that has left a great Fame behind her still in <HI>Ethi∣opia;</HI> insomuch, that King <HI>Susneus</HI> would often praise her for her Virtue and Moderation. She is famous among the <HI>Europeans</HI> for her Letters sent to <HI>Emanuel</HI> the First, King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> of which we shall hereafter speak more at large. <HI>David</HI> at the beginning of his Reign very prosperous in his Undertakings (for he had won several Victories from the <HI>Adelans</HI>) after his Grandmothers Decease, as if he had now the Curb in his teeth, giving himself up to Luxury, and the love of Women, was very Unfortunate toward the end of his days. For being driven out of all his Kingdoms and Territories, he was forc'd to betake himself with some few Soldiers to the Rock <HI>Damo,</HI> where he dy'd in the Forty sixth year of his Age. In this the more unhappy, that during his Reign, the Nation of the <HI>Gallans,</HI> the Scourge of <HI>Habes∣sinia</HI> made their first Incursions out of <HI>Bali.</HI> He had four Sons; of whom, the first <HI>Victor,</HI> dy'd before the Father; of the other three we shall have occasion to speak in due place. He was very well vers'd in Holy Writ, and in the three first Councils, as may be understood by his Discourses with <HI>Alvarez.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Claudius,</HI> by his other Name call'd <HI>Atznaff-Saghed,</HI> the Son of <HI>David,</HI> came to a Kingdom miserably shatter'd, and over∣burthen'd with Calamity; and lurking in the utmost Con∣fines of his Dominions, there attended some miraculous assi∣stance
<PB N="174" REF="74"/>
from Heaven; which soon after answer'd his Expecta∣tion; <HI>John</HI> the Second, King of <HI>Portugal</HI> sending him Suc∣cour, under the Conduct of that most Valiant and Noble Portuguese <HI>Christopher Gamas,</HI> who with a small Band of Four hundred <HI>Portuguese</HI> Foot Soldiers, overthrew vast Armies of the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> and laid the Foundations of regaining the <HI>Habessinian</HI> Empire. <HI>Claudius</HI> was a man of a most Princely Port. For besides the outward Grace of his Person, he was endu'd with many Virtues of the Mind, which made him judg'd by all worthy of the Royal Dignity. The Fathers of the Society applauded him for a most Prudent Prince, though otherwise not so well pleased with him, because he had not shew'd that Affection to the <HI>Roman</HI> See, as they re∣quir'd; though he did not prohibit the Divine Worship of the <HI>Latin</HI> Church; nor hinder'd the <HI>Roman</HI> Priests from the free Exercise of their Religion. He was also Learned, and well instructed in Ecclesiastical Antiquity. So that, as <HI>Telle∣zius</HI> witnesses, his Teachers seem'd illiterate in comparison of their Scholar. For in Disputes with the Fathers of the Society, he himself for the most part would argue, with so much vehemence, that sometimes he put them hard to it to make him an Answer. And when he observ'd that the <HI>Habessines</HI> were blam'd for retaining certain <HI>Judaic</HI> Rights contrary to the Christian Laws, he put into Writing a suc∣cinct Confession of Faith, by which he clear'd all Objections, and excus'd himself and his Subjects. That Confession we formerly<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">In <HI>England,</HI> Anno <HI>1667.</HI> It is also added to our <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Lexicon and Grammar.</NOTE> set forth, and shall publish again in our Com∣mentary: So that the Fathers of the Society could object no∣thing but Schism against so great and famous a Monarch. He reign'd Eighteen years and some Months, with great toil and trouble, by reason of his continual Wars with the <HI>Ade∣lans,</HI> who mindful of the overthrows they had receiv'd, fre∣quently attempted Revenge. The King stout of hand and indefatigable, never refus'd Battel, till at last in the Month of <HI>March,</HI> 1559. fighting against <HI>Nurus,</HI> the Captain of the <HI>Adelans,</HI> his Army being vanquish'd, guarded only with Eighteen <HI>Portugueses,</HI> and Combating more furiously than warily, he fell by an Immature but not unrevenged Death. He left no Children behind him; whence it came to pass,
<PB N="175" REF="74"/>
that the Right of Succession being very ambiguous in <HI>Ethio∣pia,</HI> the Contention was long dubious between his Brother <HI>Menas,</HI> and <HI>Tascar,</HI> the Natural Son of <HI>Jacob,</HI> the second Bro∣ther deceased. For this claim'd the Kingdom in right of his Father, while he liv'd, the Elder Brother, the other alledg'd himself to be the nearer in Blood, than he who was Ille∣gitimate. The Controversie being decided by the Sword, <HI>Tascar</HI> was taken in the Battel, and thrown headlong down a Rock.</P>
<P><HI>Menas,</HI> otherwise<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Erroneous here, some Historians ignorant that the word signifies a Gem, call him <HI>Adam.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Adamas-Saghed,</HI> having obtain'd the Kingdom by Arms, being of a Cruel Disposition, degenera∣ted altogether from the Lenity, Sincerity, and Piety of the <HI>Habessines;</HI> as if he had learnt the savageness of the <HI>Tvrks</HI> and <HI>Arabians,</HI> among whom he had been long a Captive. For he hated the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> as minding their own Affairs; and forbid the use of the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, not suffering any of the <HI>Habessines</HI> to go into the <HI>Latin</HI> Churches. He also re∣vok'd the Liberty which his Predecessor <HI>Claudius</HI> had granted to the Wives and Families of the <HI>Portugueses</HI> to frequent the <HI>Roman</HI> Chappels; which caus'd many to wish again for the Clemency of <HI>Claudius,</HI> with which they were not contented however before. He despis'd the Romish Bishop <HI>Andrew Oviedo,</HI> who in the Reign of <HI>Claudius,</HI> was sent to make way for the new Patriarch; and for some Months kept him in Prison. Nor was he much more kind to his own Subjects. For which reason, out of an aversion to his Proceedings, they revolted from him in several Parts. Among the rest, <HI>Isaac Bahrnagassus,</HI> a man in great Power, and skill'd in Mi∣litary Discipline, calling the <HI>Turks</HI> to his Assistance upon the Twentieth of <HI>April,</HI> 1562. overcame the King in Battel, and slew him: to the great detriment of <HI>Habessinia.</HI> For ever since that time, the <HI>Turks</HI> have been Masters of the Coast of the Red Sea. He left three Sons, <HI>Sarza-Denghel, Lesanax,</HI> and <HI>Tazcar.</HI> Of which the last dy'd without Children.</P>
<P><HI>Sarza-Denghel,</HI> taking the Government upon him, call'd himself <HI>Malac-Saghed,</HI> and was Inaugurated after the ancient manner at <HI>Axuma.</HI> His Fortune was equal to his Vertues; for he was stout of Hand, and wise in Counsel. And first he drave the <HI>Turks,</HI> who were Masters of <HI>Dobarva,</HI> the Me∣tropolis

of the Maritime Province, out of <HI>Tigra.</HI> He would also have driven them out of the Port of <HI>Arkiko,</HI> and the Isle of <HI>Matzua,</HI> had he not been recall'd to defend his Upland Dominions from the Incursions of the <HI>Galans.</HI> These People by the Rapines and Plunder of five and twenty years, while the <HI>Habessines</HI> were busied in so many other Wars increased to that power, that now they over-ran <HI>Habessinia</HI> not with scattering Troops, but with compleat Armies. So that all the time of his Reign, though otherwise prosperous in War, he was forc'd to struggle with them. However he subdu'd <HI>Enarea,</HI> and caus'd the Prince thereof to turn Christian. For he carefully observ'd the Christian Religion, according to the Constitutions of the Church of <HI>Alexandria.</HI> The <HI>Latin</HI> Rites he left indifferent. And for the Fathers of the Society; he often commended their Conversation of Life, and their Studies, but despised their Doctrine, saying, That their Manners, and not their Doctrine was to be imitated. Cer∣tainly Manners and Doctrine do not always accord. And therefore, <HI>sometimes the Doctrine is to be approv'd, where the Man∣ners are not Correspondent; and sometimes the Manners are to be imi∣tated, where the Doctrine is not to be follow'd.</HI> But tho he were Prosperous in his Affairs of Government and War; yet in his Marriage he was unfortunate; for his Wife <HI>Mariamsena</HI> brought him many Daughters, but not one Son. He had two Natural Sons, of which one was call'd <HI>Za-Marjam,</HI> and the other <HI>Jacob;</HI> but they could not succeed by the Laws of the<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tellezius</HI> tells us, <HI>l. 3. c. 14.</HI> that the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Laws will not allow Bastards to succeed. Which nevertheless is not agreeable with what he says in another place, <HI>l. 3. c. 29.</HI></NOTE> Kingdom. And therefore it fell out with him as with many others, who are more addicted to illicit Concubinage, than lawful Matrimony, that they want Successors from their own Loins; and frequently expose their Kingdoms to War and Bloodshed upon Disputes of Succession. First, therefore he shew'd to the Nobility <HI>Za-Denghel,</HI> his Brother <HI>Lecanax</HI>'s Son, as the Son of a Prince adorn'd in Royal Habit. Then again, some few Months before his Death, he began to change his mind, either envying a greater Adoration to the Rising than the Setting Sun; or whether it were that <HI>Za-Denghel</HI> himself, certain of the Succession gave the less re∣spect
<PB N="177" REF="75"/>
to his Uncle, or whether his Disposition were not grateful to the Nobility. However it were, <HI>Jacob,</HI> a Child of Seven years of Age, never seen before to the King, came to Court; which was no obscure intimation, that he would be preferr'd before <HI>Za-Denghel,</HI> as being of the King's own Blood. The Grandees, whether they durst not admonish the King; or whether they had an intention to usurp the Government, under pretence of being Guardians to the Mi∣nor, consented to the King: But soon after they taught us to understand how uncertain the Tranquillity of Kingdoms is, where the Right of Succession is uncertain, or that there are no Rules; but that the grand Affairs of a Kingdom are at the disposal of Courtiers, intent upon their own Interest. Ne∣vertheless, most wonderful to relate, when the King upon his return from the War with the <HI>Gallans,</HI> fell sick, and found himself near his end, Right and Justice more prevail'd with him, than Hatred against his Brother's Son, or love to his own Illegitimate, and therefore calling before him the chief of his Nobility, he is reported to have spoken thus:</P>
<P><HI>Seeing that the end of my life Approaches, I thought that next the Care of my Soul, that of my Kingdom was the chiefest, the safe∣ty of which I have always held no less dear to me, than the Salvation of my own Soul. True it is, that having none Legitimate, I always lov'd</HI> Jacob <HI>as my own. And I have observ'd in him Endowments of Mind not unworthy so fair an Inheritance; so that I could not have had any reason to repent, had I Establish'd him my Successor; nor you, had you yielded him Obedience. But now I prefer the Love of my Country, and the Laws of the Kingdom before my private Affe∣ction. Therefore it is, that I recommend to your Allegiance</HI> Za-Denghel <HI>my Brother's Son, my nearest Kinsman, stout in War, Mature in years, conspicuous for his virtues, and one that by those virtues Merits the high Dignity which is due to him by Birth.</HI> Ha∣ving thus said, in a short while after he expir'd.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An.</HI> 1596:</NOTE></P>
<P>But as it was a thing absolutely unexpected by the Nobi∣lity, that the King would change his Mind; so the Ma∣nagement of Affairs among themselves during the Minority of the King, was that which they had already deeply fix'd in their minds; nay more, they had under-hand already divided the great Offices of the Kingdom. And therefore repining to find the Power thus as it were ravish'd out of their hands, they perfidiously enter into a Conspiracy. To which pur∣pose they conceal the Death of the King, and sending away
<PB N="178" REF="76"/>
some few Bands of Soldiers drawn together in hast, they cause <HI>Za-Denghel</HI> to be apprehended, and carry'd away into the Island of <HI>Udeka,</HI> lying in the <HI>Tzanic Lake;</HI> and then changing his Imprisonment from Rock to Rock, carry'd him up and down to prevent his Conspiring with the Neighbour∣ing People. The same Trap was lay'd for <HI>Susneus;</HI> for that they fear'd least he being youthful, and brave, seeing the Order of the Succession so disturb'd, should put in for a share and assert his Claim; as afterwards he did. But he escap'd in good time to the <HI>Gallans,</HI> where he fix'd himself among them against the threatning Danger, resolving if need re∣quir'd to make use of their Assistance. The Chiefs of the Faction were <HI>Ras-Athanasius,</HI> a man of high Authority; and <HI>Keflawahed,</HI> Viceroy of <HI>Tigra,</HI> who having cajol'd into the Conspiracy, the Queen Dowager his Mother-in-Law, cove∣tous of preserving her Power, by means of her Son's nonage, as it were under colour of lawful Power, they presently set the Crown upon the head of <HI>Jacob,</HI> then a Child of Seven years of Age, and therefore call'd the Infant King; reserving the management of Affairs to themselves. A <HI>trium-virate</HI> unu∣sual with a Woman, and therefore not like to endure long. For, seven years after <HI>Jacob</HI> coming to be of Age, impatient of so many Tutors, assum'd the Reins of Government into his own hands; perhaps more imperiously than might be∣come a Lad of 15 years of Age. The Guardians therefore taking it ill to be so soon depriv'd of their Power, seeing their Obedience would immediately follow, chose rather to obey their lawful King, and render themselves deserving of his new Favours. Therefore before <HI>Jacob</HI> could fix him∣self in his Throne, as it were induc'd out of Repentance, that they had preferr'd an Infant and Illegitimate before a law∣ful Successor and of ripe Age, they recall <HI>Za-Denghel</HI> then lurking in the most remote Mountains of the Kingdom, and salute him King by the Name of <HI>Asnaff-Saghed;</HI> which they did the sooner, and that with the more speed, that they might have the less reason to give an Accompt of what was done, to the new King.</P>
<P><HI>Jacob</HI> with only Eight of his Guard, for the rest had de∣serted him with his Fortune, hastens to <HI>Samena</HI> to his Mo∣thers Kindred; but being known in his flight and taken, he was brought back to <HI>Za-Denghel,</HI> who shewing the Effects of a strange Compassion, receiv'd his Rival with a singular Affe∣ction
<PB N="179" REF="76"/>
and Clemency, and trusting to his own Right, would never incur the censure of being Cruel in cutting off his Nose and Eyes, which was usually done to others in the same Condition, and to which he himself was advis'd. For he scorn'd to pollute himself with a Crime after the manner of Tyrants, who distrustful of their own Right, or the Peo∣ples Affections, count it a piece of Policy to cut off their Rivals in Empire, how innocent soever, imputing to them before-hand the future Crimes that may happen to be com∣mitted not by them, but any Promoters of Sedition: How∣ever he sent the degraded King into <HI>Enarea,</HI> the most re∣mote Kingdom of <HI>Habessinia,</HI> under a strict Guard, in a short time to be restored to the Kingdom to his own Ruin.</P>
<P><HI>Za-Denghel,</HI> for Grace of Utterance and Majesty of Coun∣tenance was equally Venerable (as are most of the Princes of the Royal Blood of <HI>Habessinia</HI>) in the most flourishing years of pleasing Youth; and through his Experience of Adversity and Prosperity worthy of the high degree, to which he had arriv'd; and which was more than all, mild and ready to Forgive. For among all the crow'd of so ma∣ny Enemies, he never punish'd any, as by Law he might have done: but without any disgrace, suffer'd them to con∣tinue in their several Offices, and in the same degrees of Ho∣nour even the Queen her self: so mild and gentle even to a fault is the Disposition of those Kings, saith <HI>Tellezius.</HI> More∣over he behav'd himself with an undaunted Courage in all sorts of Danger: For he had hardly grasp'd the Helm of Government in his hands, when the <HI>Gallans</HI> understanding the Divisions at Court fell into <HI>Habessinia</HI> with three Armies, and overthrew the Governor of <HI>Gojam,</HI> who presum'd to fight against the King's Command, whereupon the King ar∣riving soon after, leading an Army tir'd by a long March, with a greater Courage than Force, he assail'd the Enemy; who pufft up with Victory, bore down the <HI>Habessines</HI> with so much Violence, that the Captains finding their Battalions recoil, perswaded the King to betake himself to an early flight. When he, disdaining the motion, as arguing Effemi∣nacy, leapt from his Horse, and advancing with his Sword and Buckler, cry'd out, <HI>Here will I die; you if you please, may flye; perhaps you may escape the fury of the</HI> Gallans, <HI>but never the Infamy of deserting your King.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="77"/>The <HI>Habessines</HI> mov'd with such a Speech, and the Coun∣tenance of their Prince, cast themselves into a Globe, and with a Prodigious fury, like Men prepar'd to dye, broke in among the <HI>Gallans,</HI> and constrain'd them to give back; which the Fugitives perceiving presently return'd, and re∣newing the Fight, gain'd a glorious Victory with such a Slaughter of the Enemy, that a greater had not been made among them at any other time. The King believing that the Advantages of such a Victory were not to be let slip, did not indulge himself to be as soon overcome with Banquets and Luxury, under pretence of Refreshment, but with a swift March, led his Army over Mountains and Rocks, against the other Body of the Enemy, which with the same success he put to Flight; The third Army, not daring to withstand the force of the <HI>Habessine,</HI> retreated into the Fastnesses of their Country. Of these, Four hundred thought themselves se∣cure with their Prey, in a steep, and almost inaccessible Mountain. But the <HI>Habessines</HI> now contemning their Ene∣mies, already terrify'd with the Slaughter of their own Peo∣ple; couragiously drave them from their Holds, and slew them every Mothers Son.</P>
<P>About the same time <HI>Peter Pays</HI> a Jesuit, arriving in <HI>Ha∣bessinia,</HI> at the Request of the King went to Court, and so oblig'd him with several Discourses concerning Matters as well Ecclesiastical as Civil, that at first privately, then publickly he embrac'd the <HI>Latin</HI> Religion, which he testify'd by Letters as well to the Pope, as to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> then <HI>Philip</HI> the Third; and preferr'd the <HI>Portugueses</HI> before his own <HI>Habessinians.</HI> But this same Kindness of his to Strangers, and a Foreign Religion, begat him the Hatred of his People, and caus'd his own Destruction. For the Nobility of the Kingdom took it in great disdain to see their Ancient Reli∣gion chang'd, and that the Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria</HI> should be deserted: And they were the more enflam'd out of their Envy to the <HI>Portugals,</HI> and the Rancour which they bore to <HI>Laeca-Marjam,</HI> the King's principal Friend. Therefore they Conspire against him among themselves. The Head of the Faction was one <HI>Saslac,</HI> born of mean Parentage, but of great fame for his Experience in War, and for that reason proud. He was exil'd by <HI>Jacob,</HI> but recall'd by <HI>Za-Denghel,</HI> and made Governor of <HI>Dembea;</HI> consequently ungrateful, and out of an inbred Stubborness, frowardly disdaining Obedience. <HI>Ras-Athanasius</HI>
<PB N="181" REF="77"/>
was drawn into this Society, a famous Captain, and a Man of great Conduct; and being first in Dignity, frown'd to see that he was but Second in the King's Fa∣vour; and therefore he proves a Traitor to a most excellent King, as one that had forgot who set the Crown upon his Head. But the Cause of Religion was the main pretence; the most prevalent to put the Minds of People into disorder: for they were not ignorant what Preparations were making at Court for the introducing of the <HI>Latin</HI> Religion. Fre∣quent Complaints were therefore divulg'd abroad, <HI>That the King was Revolted from the Church of</HI> Alexandria, <HI>the Common Mother Church: and that there was nothing intended by his fre∣quent Discourses and familiarity with the Jesuits, but the Abroga∣tion of the Institutions of their Ancestors, and the Introduction of new Ceremonies and Foreign Priests into the Kingdom. That the</HI> Portugals <HI>would come in and establish their Religion by force of Arms; and when they had done that, would endeavour also to take the Kingdom from them. That it behov'd them to succour their Distressed Countrey, and that such a King was not to be endur'd, who had first deserted the True Worship of God.</HI> These things were easily inculcated into those that were of the same mind before. But there was nothing which alienated so much the minds of the People, as that the <HI>Portugueses</HI> had been heard to say, <HI>That the Reduction,</HI> so they call'd the <HI>Conversion of</HI> Ethiopia, <HI>was but vainly attempted, if it could not be upheld by force of Arms.</HI> The King, having detected the Conspi∣racy, calls the <HI>Portugueses</HI> together, confiding in them, as Foreigners and Men of the <HI>Latin</HI> Religion: then marching with all speed toward <HI>Gojam,</HI> he was deserted by the way, first by <HI>Ras-Athanasius,</HI> whom tho he suspected, he durst not apprehend; then by <HI>Jonael,</HI> one of his Principal Captains. Their example many others following, forsake the King. The King seeing himself left with a slender Guard, apply∣ing himself to <HI>Peter Pays,</HI> spoke these words, <HI>This therefore befalls me, because I am desirous to shew them the way of Truth, and to set free the Weak from the Oppression of the more Power∣ful.</HI> Thereupon <HI>Peter,</HI> and the Commander of the <HI>Portugueses, John Gabriel,</HI> advis'd him <HI>to Protract the War, till the heat of the Rebels fury waxed cool; that his Friends with his Innocent Subjects would repair to his Assistance; that the rest would in time come to themselves, and repent their folly: That Sedition was like a Torrent, violent at first, but that it abated by degrees.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="78"/>But the King impatient of delay, look'd upon Protra∣ction as a Diminution of his Honour; and being too full of Courage, and in his boyling Youth, resolv'd to try the For∣tune of War, that rarely accompanies rashness, before the Rebels should encrease their Numbers. So he Marches with a small Army of scarce Twelve thousand Men, thinking to fall upon them e're they were aware of his coming. This over-hastiness had but ill success. For most of his Adversa∣ries were Men experienc'd in War, who did not follow their business negligently; and besides they were as eager to come to a Field decision, before the King should gather Strength.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Enemies of the new Religion Ren∣devouz'd together from all Parts; and among the rest <HI>Abuna Peter,</HI> the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Metropolitan, and chief Head of the Rebellion; who by an unheard of President in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> con∣trary to the Laws of God and Man, absolv'd the Rebels from the tye of their Oaths which they had Sworn to their lawful Prince, which they themselves had already broke, by virtue of a detestable Excommunication of his Prince. Thus more and more embold'nd, and contemning the Majesty of the King, they turn'd their Veneration into Hatred. And so with mutual Animosity they joyn Battel. The <HI>Portugueses,</HI> who fought in the right wing, maintain'd their ground a long time, believing the Kings and the Cause of Re∣ligion to be their own. But in the left Wing, of which the King himself took charge, all things went to rack; for ma∣ny fled over to the Enemy, many look'd on without striking a stroke, resolv'd to follow the Fortune of the Day. Thus the King forsaken by his own, fought bravely for a long time, till <HI>Laeca-Marjam,</HI> and the rest of his Guard being slain, he was himself struck down from his Horse with the sling of a Lance. After that getting up again to renew the Fight, he was stuck through the body, and slain with several Darts thrown at a distance; reverence of his person not permitting them to come near to hurt him. The third day after the Fight, he was taken up and buried without any Funeral Pomp in a little Chappel hard by the Field of the Battel. Such was the end of the short Life and Reign of this Fa∣mous and Lawful King of <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> A doleful Warning to admonish us, that the Cause of Religion ought to be mode∣rately and prudently handled. And that it behoves a Prince
<PB N="183" REF="78"/>
not to thrust himself rashly into a Battel, especially when there is no certain Successor. For proof whereof, the fatal Example of <HI>Sebastian</HI> King of <HI>Portugal</HI> may serve among the rest.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>KIng <HI>Zadenghel</HI> being thus slain, the War indeed ceas'd, yet Peace did not presently ensue. For the Rebels not dreaming of such a speedy Victory, had not consider'd of a Successor. Wherefore, as it were stupid with Emulation, <HI>Ras-Athanasius</HI> departs for <HI>Gojam,</HI> and <HI>Zaslac</HI> for <HI>Dembea,</HI> with∣out ever holding any common Consultation. Thereupon <HI>Susneus,</HI> hearing of the King's death, and believing that the Kingdom was now fallen to Him, as being the Son of <HI>Basi∣lides,</HI> the Nephew of <HI>Jacob,</HI> and Grandchild of <HI>David;</HI> and then being also a Young man, train'd up in the <HI>Gallan</HI> Wars, belov'd and surrounded with the choicest of the Military Bands, he conceiv'd no small hopes of his design. First there∣fore he sends before one of the Faithfullest of his Friends to <HI>Ras-Athanasius,</HI> with instructions to declare to him in short, <HI>That whereas the Kingdom belong'd to him by right of Inheritance, he should come presently and joyn Forces with his.</HI> In the mean time, <HI>Susneus,</HI> not expecting an Answer, follows the Messenger with the nimblest of his Army, and writes to <HI>Athanasius</HI> as if
<PB N="184" REF="79"/>
already made King, <HI>That he was at hand, and that therefore he should come to meet him and pay him the accustom'd honours due to him. Athanasius</HI> amaz'd at the unexpected approach of <HI>Susneus,</HI> void of Counsel, the Danger being Equal on both sides, either to refuse or admit him, at length, finding all assistance far di∣stant, and no hopes of delay, to give him time to consult with <HI>Zaslac,</HI> he rather chose to be before-hand with the new King's Favours, than to hazard the uncertain Fortune of a Battel. So that <HI>Susneus,</HI> being honourably receiv'd into the Camp, was saluted <HI>King.</HI> Which done, he presently writes to <HI>Zaslac, That by the Providence of God he had recovered the Throne of his Ancestors; and was now marching for</HI> Dembea: <HI>therefore he should take Care that there might be Forces there ready to receive him, and those deserved Favours which he was ready to bestow upon them.</HI> But he, tho astonish'd at the suddain News, was unwilling to acknowledg him for King, whom he had not made himself; and therefore consulting with his Friends, return'd for answer, <HI>That he would then obey him, if</HI> Jacob, <HI>to whom he had already by Message offer'd the Kingdom, did not come before</HI> June; <HI>and therefore begg'd that short delay. Susneus,</HI> no way pleas'd with the Condition, wrote back to him again, <HI>That he was King already, and therefore would give place neither to</HI> Jacob, <HI>once before adjudg'd unworthy, nor to his Father</HI> Malec-Saghed, <HI>though he should return from the other World. Zaslac,</HI> having receiv'd this surly Answer, equally mettlesom and diligent, turns his Arms upon him, and comes on briskly to meet him. <HI>Susneus</HI> finding himself prevented with the spee∣dy March of his Adversary, and perceiving himself over∣match'd, and, which was worse, not well in health, retir'd to the Craggy Mountains of <HI>Amhara. Ras-Athanasius</HI> also, whose precipitancy <HI>Zaslac</HI> had upbraided, retreated into other Fastnesses to avoid the Fury of his Associate. In the mean time there being no News of <HI>Jacob,</HI> the other Captains and Commanders of the Army began to scatterwords of discon∣tent, <HI>That they would not be without a King, that if</HI> Jacob <HI>would not come, there was no Person fitter than</HI> Susneus, <HI>neither would he be at rest, till he had obtain'd by force, what they would not give him by fair means. Zaslac,</HI> fearing the Inconstancy of his own People, and consequently a Revolt, orders Commissioners to be sent; and by them surrenders the Scepter to <HI>Susneus,</HI> who presently sent a Person to whom Allegiance should be sworn in his Name. Which being done, Ten of the chiefest Peers ride forth to
<PB N="185" REF="79"/>
meet the new King, and to conduct him with a Pomp be∣fitting into the Camp. And now Shouts and Acclamations are to be every where heard. Neither were Banquets want∣ing, with all other Solemnities usual at the Inaugurations of their Kings; when on a sudden new Commissioners from <HI>Jacob,</HI> quite disturb'd their mirth, with such a suddain altera∣tion, as with which Fortune never more odly mock'd before the hopes of those that thought themselves in the possession of a Throne. For <HI>Jacob</HI> twice Depos'd, twice restor'd, between the Highest and the Lowest, (which is most rare) had twice Experience of the Mean betwixt both. While the Promoters of these Troubles exercis'd their Hatred and their Love with∣out fear of punishment, that one might think it the sport of Scenes, rather than a serious possession of Royalty. For im∣mediatly <HI>Zaslac,</HI> without any hesitation, rode forth to meet <HI>Jacoh,</HI> as if he had bin <HI>Susneus</HI> himself, to whom he had but just before sworn Fidelity, and receiv'd him with the usual Ho∣nours due to <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Majesty, and with his whole Army salu∣ted him King, the Commissioners, sent to <HI>Susneus,</HI> being pri∣vately recall'd. <HI>Susneus,</HI> knowing Time was to be watch'd, once more gave way to Fortune, and retir'd to his former lurking holes, and hid himself again in the Natural Fortresses of <HI>Amhara.</HI> For he had learnt from the Example of <HI>Zaden∣ghel,</HI> to give way to Popular Heats and Tumults, till they cool'd of themselves: for that the People after their first Passions are spent, resume their former Modesty, and return repenting to their duty. <HI>Ras-Athanasius</HI> also, tho so great a Person, yet accustom'd to follow Fortune, rather than his Faith, he, I say, with the same Easiness that he had acknow∣ledg'd <HI>Susneus,</HI> fell at the feet of <HI>Jacob.</HI></P>
<P>And now <HI>Jacob,</HI> did not think it prudent to suffer a Rival in his Dignity, and therefore resolving to try what might be done by way of agreement, he commanded <HI>Susneus</HI>'s Mother to go to her Son, and offer him the Kingdoms of <HI>Amhara, Wa∣leka,</HI> and <HI>Shewa,</HI> as also all the Lands which his Father pos∣sess'd, and he had hitherto claim'd in vain. But <HI>Susneus</HI> bear∣ing a lofty Soul, deny'd, <HI>That what he had receiv'd by the Gift of God, could be taken from him by Men. That the whole Kingdom was his due, which he would not relinquish but with his Life; That</HI> Jacob <HI>would deal with more Justice and Uprightness, to quit his Dia∣dem, than to hasten Ruin to himself and his Countrey.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="80"/>This haughty answer being deliver'd, <HI>Jacob</HI> decreed to de∣cide the business not with Messages, but by the Sword. How∣ever, <HI>Susneus</HI> Expert at delays, by the assistance of the Rocks and Mountains, avoyded the pursuit of <HI>Jacob,</HI> watching for those Opportunities which soon after presented themselves. For <HI>Zaslac,</HI> whether out of a vain-glory to behold the Event of the Battel, or out of any private Indignation, did not joyn his Forces with <HI>Jacob;</HI> but on the contrary, and as it were in despight of Military discipline, acted all things carelesly and remissly; believing his fame a Terror sufficient to the Enemy. This was not conceal'd from <HI>Susneus,</HI> who taking a shorter way came upon <HI>Zaslac</HI> so of a suddain, that his Soul∣diers had not time to handle their Arms, much less to put themselves into order: so that they were slain like sheep, and utterly routed, and <HI>Zaslac,</HI> having lost his Army, was forc'd to entrust his Safety to an ignominoous flight. Which Victory as it dejected <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Friends, so it rais'd the spirits of <HI>Susneus</HI>'s Party. <HI>Zaslac</HI> himself had lost the Kings favour, and began to be suspected. Thus the business began to work; for <HI>Zaslac</HI> jealous of these disparagements, notwithstanding <HI>Jacob</HI> had heap'd so many favours upon him, for he had created him <HI>Legate Royal,</HI> began to Enter into a Correspondence with <HI>Susneus,</HI> using Treachery as the hire of those that valu'd him most. <HI>Susneus</HI> standing in need of his Power, accepted his Propositions, and dissembling his Hatred, made him a Con∣federate in the War, to lessen the force of his Enemy. <HI>Jacob</HI> hearing of his Revolt, judging that it behov'd him to make hast, before the rest should follow his Example, resolv'd to put it to the hazard of a Battel; well knowing that he far exceeded <HI>Susneus</HI> in number of men: nor did <HI>Susneus</HI> refuse him, tho inferior: however, he cunningly kept the rough and hilly Grounds, watching like a Lyon when to take his fatal jump.</P>
<P>The Enemy judging his delay to proceed from his fear, and confiding in their multitude, began to act more daringly, and to provoke <HI>Susneus</HI> with upbraiding Language, until he had brought them into a narrow place where he could not be surrounded by his Enemies. Then Exhorting his Souldiers, <HI>Now,</HI> said he, <HI>the day is come, that You may make me King of</HI> Ethi∣opia: <HI>and for Your selves, You are to be either Masters or Slaves, as You behave Your selves. I will not be onely the Companion of Your
<PB N="187" REF="80"/>
Victory, but your Dangers: Victory is in your own power, so that you do not turn your backs to your Enemies, before you see me begin to flye.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus Encourag'd his Souldiers, he gave the Signal of Battel. Which seen, they gave so furious an Onsett, that the Enemy was every where beaten down, without resist∣ance, amaz'd and astonish'd, to be so subdu'd by those whom they reck'ned for fugitives. The slaughter was great, with little loss on <HI>Susneus</HI>'s side. <HI>Jacob</HI> himself, toge∣ther with <HI>Abuna-Peter,</HI> who had in vain thunder'd out his Anathema's against the Enemy, were both slain. Which <HI>Susneus</HI> understanding, sounded a retreat, that by his cle∣mency to the Common Soldiery and his own Country∣men, he might win to himself the Reputation of Gen∣tleness, necessary for the Establishment of a New Prince.</P>
<P>But such was the Terror that possessed the hearts of the <HI>Jacobeans,</HI> forc'd on by the croud of Fugitives, igno∣rant of the Country, tho there was no pursuit, that they threw themselves headlong in the night time from a Rock dismally steep and cragged. Among the rest, there was a certain Portuguese, by name <HI>Emanuel-Gonsalvo,</HI> who betimes perceiving his Horse as it were flying in the Air, quitting his Stirrups, left him, and taking hold by chance of the branch of a Tree, made a shift to recover a Seat in the bough, where he sate all night. Nor did he well un∣derstand his danger, till day appearing, he discovered, not without horror, at a prodigious distance underneath him, a vast heap of Men and Horses with their Limbs and Members broken all to flitters.</P>
<P><HI>Susneus</HI> having obtain'd so great a Victory, exercis'd no so sort of Severity or Reveng against any Person; only <HI>Maharhin</HI> he commanded to be beheaded, as being a follow∣er of the sect of <HI>Islamism,</HI> and the Person that had first wounded <HI>Zadenghel.</HI></P>
<P>After that he departed for <HI>Coga,</HI> there to, settle the Af∣fairs of his Kingdom, where <HI>Zaslac</HI> whom he could not endure to see, was still in his Eye, the grand promoter of all these troubles. He was the first that went over to <HI>Susneus</HI>'s Party, and therefore was look't upon by <HI>Susneus</HI> as one that would be constantly casting in his Dish the kind∣nesses he had done, and pride himself to be the setter up of kings. And indeed in one of his vain-glorious humors, of

which deserving Soldiers are generally too much guilty, he had unwarily given out, That it was foretold him, <HI>That he should pull down three Kings, which was fulfill'd in Two.</HI> So that the New King seem'd only to be wanting for the third. It being therefore a Maxim, <HI>That jealousie and friend∣ship cannot long remain in one and the same Brest, and that the fruit of Treason being reap'd, there is no farther need of the Trai∣tor,</HI> the King commanded him to be apprehended and car∣ried away into the steep Mountain of <HI>Gueman,</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Gojam.</HI> He would not put him to death, as not believing it became a noble Prince to take away a mans life for fear of a future crime. But he making his Escape, about a year after, invaded <HI>Waleka,</HI> where having gather'd together some Troops of Vagabonds and dissolute Persons, he supported himself by Robbery and Rapine; till at last, making his Incursions into <HI>Gojam,</HI> he was there slain by the <HI>Pagans.</HI> His head being brought to the King, was fix'd upon a Lance, and set up before the Roy∣al Pavillion, to be view'd by all the World; no man pitying his misfortune, in regard that all people knew his advance∣ment had cost the loss of so many innocent lives.</P>
<P>Not so inglorious was the end of <HI>Ras-Athanasius,</HI> and yet sufficiently miserable. For he every day losing more and more of the Kings favour, was at length the contempt of all men; Insomuch that his wife, the daughter of <HI>Malec-Saghed,</HI> unaccustom'd to brook indignities, forsook his bed.

And not only so, but to render himself formidable to the <HI>Gallans.</HI> To that pur∣pose he kindly receiv'd the <HI>Fathers of the Society</HI> then living in <HI>Dembea.</HI> He sent for <HI>Peter-Pays,</HI> and most courteously gave ear to him; and treated him as his familiar Friend.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="81"/>And as he was favourable and bountiful to them; so did he dayly afford many testimonies of his kindness to the rest of the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> and the more to oblige them he set up the Latin Religion; nothing terrify'd by the example of <HI>Za-denghel.</HI> And indeed the Fathers had such a power o∣ver him, that at length he surrender'd himself to the Pope, and together with his Son, sware obedience to him as Universal Bishop, and Vicar of Christ, abrogating the Religion of <HI>Alexandria.</HI> Which was afterwards the occasi∣on of horrid uproars, bloody wars, and the slaughter of many great Personages.</P>
<P>But the possession of a Kingdom won by the Sword, sel∣dom enjoys a perfect tranquility, especially when the death of the Predecessor comes be in question. For presently, that is to say, the very next year, up starts a counterfeit <HI>Ja∣cob,</HI> who alarum'd all <HI>Habessinia</HI> with the fear of a new War. Some there were, that acknowledg'd they both knew and saw the dead body of King <HI>Jacob,</HI> after the blood was wip'd away, but no man durst assert himself to be the Person that kill'd him. The Counterfeit therefore addresses himself to the Monks of the famous Monastery of <HI>Bizan,</HI> in the prefecture of <HI>Bahrnagassus;</HI> where he re∣main'd, and to hide the fraud, as if his face had bin dis∣figur'd with his wounds, went always vail'd. Nor was it long before his Story was believ'd. Not so much out of respect to his own Person, as out of malice to <HI>Susneus,</HI> whom they hated as a Person that was unknown to them, and by his exilement inur'd to the Savage Customs of the <HI>Gallans.</HI> Neither were they pleas'd with <HI>Raas-Seelech;</HI> his brother by the Mother's side, whom he had made Vice∣roy of <HI>Tigra,</HI> whom they look'd upon also as a forraigner. So that he not being able himself to quell the Disturban∣ces, the King was forc'd to advance himself. But the Re∣bels having intelligence of his coming, fled several ways, to avoyd fighting. Their Captain, with only four of his Associates, and some few Goats, which he carry'd with him for their milks sake, secur'd themselves by a painful Pilgri∣mage through the most wild and uncouth concealments of Nature, that the Rocks could afford him, where it was im∣possible to trace him. So that the King dispairing, after a tedious search, to find him out, return'd to <HI>Dembea,</HI> and ha∣ving solemniz'd his Inauguration at <HI>Axuma,</HI> after the anci∣ent

Custom of the Country, he made <HI>Ansalax</HI> Governor of <HI>Tigra,</HI> in the room of his Brother, who afterwards by the help of two Noblemen that counterfeited themselves their friends, having apprehended the Rebels, put them to death.</P>
<P>But what was more strange, our <HI>Europe</HI> it self could not, some time after, discern an <HI>Aethiopian</HI> Counterfeit of the same name.</P>

However he was unhappy during his Reign, by rea∣son of his continual Wars, and the frequent Rebellions of his Subjects, whom he sent to compel by force to submit to what he thought convenient to enjoyn them. He swore obedience to the Pope; before he had weigh'd what benefit he might get by it. And therefore toward his latter End, he was forc'd to indulge that Liberty, for the maintaining of which, many Thousands had already lost their Lives.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Of the Royal Succession, and the Imprisonment of the Kings Children in the Rock <HI>Geshen,</HI> now quite out of use.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Certain Succession the Safety of Kingdoms. Two Bonds of Government. How far Prudence, how far Nobility and Power prevail. Election not alwayes to be preferr'd before Succession: more agreeable to Liberty. The Males only succeed in <HI>Abassia.</HI> Their Claim dubious: hence Wars. The Incon∣veniencies of Hereditary Kingdoms. The ill Events of uncertain Succes∣sion. The Imprisonment of the Kings Children. <HI>Tellezius</HI>'s Relation of it. The Custom for <HI>300</HI> Years, abrogated by <HI>Naod. Alvarez</HI>'s Relation: it disagrees with <HI>Tellezius:</HI> reconcil'd: No president for half a Century. The pleasantness of those Rocks fabulous. The severe usage of those Prin∣ces there. The severity of the Governour displeasing to the Prince: pleas'd him when King.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FRom what has bin said, it appears that the Succession of the Kings of <HI>Habessinia</HI> is uncertain; and that there is no great difference made between the Legitimate and he Illegi∣timate. However, the most assured Safety of Kingdoms con∣sists in a Constant and Establish'd Settlement of Succession But if in Hereditary Kingdoms, it may be lawful either for the King to choose one of his Sons; or if it may be lawful for the Nobility, not so much to regard the order of birth, as the disposition and conditions of him that is to govern, or to re∣spect the favour of the People, War and Sedition must of ne∣cessity follow.</P>
<P>They that are set aside will never be quiet; nor shall they want Factious Abettors and Associates. The Grand Pretence, more Especially in Elective Kingdoms, is this, <HI>That Conditions cannot be distinguish'd by Nativities; but the best may be taken by Election and Judgment.</HI> A specious pretence in words, but vain in Reality; while the Imbecility of human Nature prevails, which is guided by the affections, and obeys rather Favour and Hatred, than Virtue; which usually happens in great Assemblies. But there are two Pillars which sustain the Safety of great Monarchies, Reverence and Authority, which they that Govern never can reconcile to themselves either by Wisdom or Probity alone. For there are many who
<PB N="194" REF="86"/>
will esteem themselves if not their Superiors, yet their Equals: and men very unwillingly obey their Equals, much less their Inferiours: so that it is altogether vain and pedantic, what <HI>Plato</HI> writes concerning the Felicity of Kingdoms, <HI>That they should be Govern'd by Philosophers,</HI> while other Aids are wanting. A Philosopher, how wise soever, would hardly find a Sub∣ject that would obey him three days together for his Philo∣sophies sake. There ought to be something External and Visible, which as well the vulgar and ordinary sort, as the prudent, Equally acknowledg, which is not subjected to the fluctuating and inconstant determination of Men. For this reason in the Election of Kings and Princes, <HI>Nobility</HI> and Power are preferr'd before Wisdom and Sanctity of disposi∣tion. Yet the one requires the assistance of the other. The one is the cause that the Subject willingly and freely obeys; the other compels the refractory to submit. And therefore because Election does not bring much more advantage to a Kingdom, than the chance of birth, but is rather liable to Tu∣mults and Seditions, many People have<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Swedes</HI> in the last Century. The <HI>Danes</HI> in our memory; The <HI>Chi∣neses</HI> of old. <HI>Joh. Newhoft.</HI> Descript. <HI>Chin.</HI> c. 18.</NOTE> abandon'd it of their own accord. However, it approaches nearest to Li∣berty, because the Electors may prescribe Laws and Condi∣tions of Government to the Person that is to be Elected; tho that same wariness proves many times ineffectual: Because the Prince, upon refusal, either positively cannot, or else will be very unwilling to be brought to an accompt. So im∣possible it is, that there should be a compleat happiness in this World. And therefore it is the part of a good and prudent Statesman to prefer that form of Government which he finds <NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">That the Wise call <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, to preserve the present state of the Republic. <HI>Isoc.</HI> against <HI>Collimalh.</HI></NOTE> Established.</P>
<P>But I return to the <HI>Habessines,</HI> among whom there is this most prudent Constitution, That only the Male Issue shall govern, or the Male kindred nearest in blood; But because the Determination of the Fathers and Mothers, and the chief Nobility happens frequently to be intermix'd; and that the natural Issue is likewise, if male, allow'd the same Priviledge for want of Legitimate Off-spring: hence it comes to pass,
<PB N="195" REF="86"/>
that their Successions are most unhappy and turbulent; the chief cause of all their Calamities.</P>
<P>We have already declar'd, how <HI>Helena,</HI> with the consent of <HI>Marc</HI> the <HI>Metropolitan,</HI> preferr'd <HI>David</HI> the second Son before <HI>Naod</HI> the Elder Brother, as having nothing else to advance him but a meer brutish strength. The Civil Wars between <HI>Menas</HI> and <HI>Tazcar</HI> his Brothers Eldest Son; between the Ille∣gitimate Son of <HI>Malec-Saghed,</HI> and <HI>Zadenghel</HI> his Legitimate Kinsman; and lastly, between <HI>Jacob</HI> and <HI>Susneus,</HI> and all about the doubtful right of Succession, are sufficient Arguments to prove what we assert. <HI>Tellezius</HI> indeed declares, That ac∣cording to the Lawes of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> the natural Sons do not suc∣ceed. But in another place, he so discourses concerning their Law, alledging the Example of <HI>John</HI> the First, King of <HI>Portu∣gal,</HI> that the Reader may perceive, that he varies in this, from his other Relation. But the chiefest Inconvenience which uses to arise in hereditary Kingdoms, where the Succession is ty'd to a certain Family, proceeds either from the sence of Rivalship and a jealousie which they that rule have of them that are nearly related in blood; or from their Ambition, which always animates the Factious. Dismal are the Ex∣amples among the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> where there are no Laws or Rules for Succession, but all things are at the Will of them that bear sway, or else of Fortune her self. What ruin'd the Family of the <HI>Caesars?</HI> What the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire? but onely that the Creation of the Emperors was inconstant and un∣fix'd, and at the Will of the Souldiery. Certainly it was a great Oversight in <HI>Augustus Caesar,</HI> after he had vanquish'd all his Rivals, and had all the Power in his own hands, that he ordain'd no certain Settlement of Succession. The Empe∣rours of the <HI>Turks,</HI> to prevent the Crimes of their Brothers, more impiously put them to death, and punish that Disloyal∣ty which perhaps was never intended. The Ancient Kings of <HI>Abessinia,</HI> to rid themselves of these Fears, were wont to shut up their Brothers under safe Custody, where they might abide unknown to turbulent Spirits; and so be uncapable of attempting any thing against the raigning Prince; and yet be ready to supply the want of Successors. The Rocks of <HI>Geshen</HI> and <HI>Ambasel</HI> were set apart to this end. The whole Story from the Relations of <HI>Antonie d' Almeyda</HI> runs thus. The Emperour <HI>Icon Imlac</HI> had five Sons (others say nine) which he lov'd all alike. Out of which affection he most imprudently
<PB N="196" REF="87"/>
advis'd them to raign all with Equal Power; or which was worse, to govern by turns. The Youngest impatient of the delay of so many Years, design'd with himself not to part with the Scepter, when once he had got it into his hands, but to send away his Brothers to some distant Rock, and so con∣tinue the Kingdom to his own Posterity. But being betrayd by one of his peculiar Friends, who rather chose to accept of a reward from the raigning Prince, than to expect a guerdon from him that was to raign, he was taken in the same snare which he had laid for his Brothers, and sent to the Rock <HI>Geshen.</HI> But lest the King might seem to have consulted more for his own than the Security of the Kingdom, he also shut up all his own Sons, which he then had, in the same place. After which this Custom continu'd as a Fundamental Law in <HI>Ethio∣pia,</HI> for above Two hundred and thirty Years, by which means the raigning Kings were secur'd from danger of Civil Wars among Brethren; till in the Year 1590, at what time King <HI>Naod</HI> was sent for from the Rock to ascend the Throne. He had a Son, about Nine years of Age, whom he dearly lov'd; which Child, one of his chief Courtiers steadfastly beholding, <HI>Certainly,</HI> said he to the King, <HI>this Child grows apace.</HI> The Boy was of an acute Witt, and understood what the Courtier drove at, and therefore fixing his weeping Eyes upon his Fathers Face, <HI>Oh Father,</HI> said he, <HI>Have I grown thus fast, to be hurry'd from your sight to the Rock</HI> Geshen? Which word strook his Father so deeply to the heart, that having assembl'd the Nobility of his Court and Kingdom, he told them, <HI>That such a wicked and inhuman Custom was to be renounc'd.</HI> Which was immediatly done, neither he nor his Council con∣sidering that private affections are not to be preferr'd before the Safety of a Nation. And thus it came to pass, through the Kings unseasonable tenderness, that this same Custome receiv'd and continu'd in <HI>Habessinia,</HI> so much to the Health of the Government, was abrogated to the unspeakable detri∣ment of the Kingdom: And from that time never any Prince was Exil'd to those Rocks.</P>
<P><HI>Alvarez</HI> writes, <HI>That</HI> David <HI>being advanc'd to the Throne, his Younger Brother, with the rest of the Sons of</HI> Naod, <HI>were sent away to the Rock;</HI> and afterwards, <HI>That one of the Younger Sons Escap'd, but was taken and sent back; and that he saw him there.</HI> From whence it may be objected against <HI>Tellezius,</HI> That this Cu∣stome continu'd after <HI>Naod</HI>'s time.

to believe, That he foresaw this Objection, because he binds it with an Asseveration, saying, <HI>The thing is certainly true, and is easie to be confirm'd as well by the Fathers of the Society, as by the Example of</HI> Susneus, <HI>who tho he had several Sons, yet never went about to send any of them to the Rock.</HI> But then again when he sayes <HI>Alvarez</HI> is to be believ'd in all things that he saw, there is some need of Reconciliation: That is to say, That the Sons of <HI>Naod,</HI> the Brothers of <HI>David,</HI> were then carry'd to the Rock, and that one of them after an Escape was taken and sent back. So that the new Constitution might not help them, tho it were a kindness to the Sons of the succeeding Kings. The Reports concerning the Pleasantness of those Rocks, and the splendid attendance upon those Royal Exiles, are all ridicu∣lous Falsities. The Rocks we have describ'd already. And as for the splendidness of Attendance, when the Custome was in force, most certain it is, that those Princes were kept close Prisoners, and they that either attempted to Escape, or were assisting to their Escape, lay under great Penalties. The Prin∣ces themselves were harshly us'd; Neither was any person permitted to come at them, so that their Education could never fit them for a Crown, but was rather to put them out of Hopes of having any thing to do with the Affairs of this World.</P>
<P>It is reported of one of the Keepers, that one morning ob∣serving one of his Royal Prisoners putting on a Garment somewhat neater than ordinary, he not only chidd him, and tore the Vestment, but gave notice of it to his Father: all which the poor Prince was forc'd to take patiently. After∣wards the same Prince coming to be King himself, did not onely forbear to revenge the Injury, but hearing that his Keeper was gone aside, as dreading some heavy punishment, caus'd him to be sought out, and being brought before him half dead for fear, both prais'd and rewarded him; Exhorting him to continue in his Office as Faithful to Him, as he had bin to the King deceas'd. And thus we generally impose upon others, what we are very unwilling to endure our selves.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of the Priviledge and Power of the King in Ecclesiastical and Civil Affairs.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Kings Power absolute: Experienc'd by the Jesuits. <HI>Alphonsus</HI> the Patriarch offends the King. He claims the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction. He abrogates the Latin Religion; calls Synods: He forbears the right of Nomination: not bound by the Secular Laws. He has no Estates. The benefit of them: He enjoyes all Royal Priviledges, but makes not use of all: Hunting Lawful for all. Private persons have nothing proper. The King takes and gives as he pleases: Certain Families excepted.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Power of the <HI>Abessinian</HI> Kings is absolute, as well in Ecclesiastical as Civil Affairs. Of which the Fathers of the Society have had sufficient experience; in whose favour, and to whose disadvantage he has exercis'd his supream Ec∣clesiastical Authority, without ever consulting the Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria:</HI> First when he put forth several Edicts, for re∣ceiving the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, and abrogating the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Ceremonies: which was done with the consent of the Fa∣thers. Afterwards the state of Affairs changing, when he dispenc'd by public Edict with certain Ceremonies that were indifferent, <HI>Alfonsus</HI> the Patriarch reprov'd him. <HI>It is not lawful,</HI> said he, <HI>for a King to put forth any such Edict, as being purely Ecclesiastical, and belonging to the Priestly Office: and You ought to remember what the High Priest said to King</HI> Uzziah. <HI>It belongs not to thee, O King</HI> Uzziah, <HI>to offer incense to the Lord, but to the Priests, the Sons of</HI> Aaron, <HI>who are consecrated to that Mini∣stry, get thee forth out of the Sanctuary, for it will not be imputed to thee as an honour by the Lord God;</HI> to which the Patriarch added the Punishment that follow'd. The King for that time gave way to the Patriarch, and publish'd the Edict in another manner and form. But not brooking the Comparison made between him and <HI>Uzziah,</HI> among other things he gave the Patriarch this answer. <HI>Wherefore didst thou bid us be mindful of</HI> Uzziah, <HI>and wherefore didst thou compare us with him? He was therefore punish'd by God, for usurping the Office of the Priest which did not become him; and because he offer'd Incense and Sacrifice to God, which We never attempted to do: onely We commanded an Edict
<PB N="199" REF="88"/>
to be publish'd about those Indifferent things which were agreed on be∣tween Us both.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing more incens'd the King, but that he saw his Pre∣rogative call'd in question, which for so many Ages had bin enjoy'd by his Ancestors, and which was never deny'd by the Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> even before the Schisme. Nor was he ignorant what the ancient Emperours after <HI>Constantine</HI> had done in the same Cases. Nor was he so dull of apprehen∣sion, as not to be able to distinguish between Episcopal rules, and Kingly Jurisdiction, which he thought belong'd to him∣self. Which Prerogative, tho he had a great Reverence for the Patriarch, he would not part with, but rather chose to publish another Edict, which tended manifestly to the Dimi∣nution of the Patriarchal Power. For the Patriarch had or∣der'd a certain Monk to give some part of his Ecclesiastical Revenues to a certain Parish. The Monk would not obey; but complain'd to his Superiour, one <HI>Iceg,</HI> who obtain'd a Decree from the King, wherein the Patriarch was enjoyn'd to keep to the Rules of the Metropolitans of Ancient <HI>Ethiopia;</HI> and that <HI>Iceg</HI> should enjoy his due Priviledges.</P>
<P>His Prerogative in Ecclesiastical Affairs was most apparent∣ly made manifest, by the making of that severe Decree for the abrogating the Latin Worship, and restoring that of <HI>Alexandria.</HI> Moreover, the King summons the Synods of the Clergy, as often as need requires; he sends for the Me∣tropolitan out of <HI>Egypt;</HI> exercising plenary Jurisdiction over him and all the rest of his Clergy: and punishing them ac∣cording to the nature of their Offences, which the Examples recited by <HI>Alvarez,</HI> sufficiently demonstrate. In one thing however he differs from our <HI>European</HI> Kings, that he never nominates to Ecclesiastical Benefices. For the Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> sends a Metropolitan, at the request of the King indeed; but he knows not who or what he is. He also ad∣mitted the Patriarch, whom the Pope sent, tho not he but the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> nam'd him.</P>
<P>Neither are there in <HI>Ethiopia</HI> any other Ecclesiastical Dig∣nities; and therefore the Prerogative of nominating Bishops and Archbishops, signifies little or nothing. In Seculars he acknowledges no positive Laws. And well it were that he did not think himself also altogether free from the Funda∣mental
<PB N="200" REF="89"/>
Laws of his Realm, upon which the Safety of the Kingdom depends.</P>
<P>For <HI>Naod</HI> dispenc'd with the wholesome Constitutions of his Ancestors, by vertue of which the Kings Children were sent to the Rock of <HI>Amhara.</HI> And <HI>Malec-Saghed</HI> would have preferr'd his natural Son <HI>Jacob</HI> before his Brothers Legitimate Son <HI>Zadenghel;</HI> both which prov'd very disadvantagious pre∣sidents to the whole Nation.</P>
<P>But such things frequently come to pass, where the King∣dome is without Estates. For they are the most Trusty Guar∣dians of the Law, and the true Bulwarks of the Peoples Li∣berty against the Encroachments of the Ambitious. For they have a more vigilant eye and tender care over the Common∣weal, of which they are themselves Members, than the Friends of Princes, whose Fortunes hardly descend to their Heirs; so that a man may admire at their Counsels, who ta∣king away the Priviledges of <HI>Estates,</HI> endeavour to assume the whole Power into their own hands, as deeming every slight bond of the Law, to themselves heavy and intollerable. So that they are forc'd to distribute those Favours and Kind∣nesses which are due to their fellow Citizens, among the Souldiery, whose fidelity is brittle and inconstant: not caring who are poor, so they be rich: and many times the Souldiers turn those Arms which were put into their hands for the de∣fence of their Prince, against him; being put upon the fer∣ment either by the Ambition or the Wealth of some parti∣cular person. Which in <HI>Habessinia,</HI> as in all other absolute Goverments, frequently happens to the destruction of those that bear the sway.</P>
<P>He has also the sole disposal of Peace or Warr, and indeed all the Prerogatives that a King can claim (both the greater and the lesser <HI>Regalia</HI>) are solely at his devotion; tho he makes no use of many of them, merely because he is igno∣rant of them; as the Prerogative in reference to Metals, Coyning of Money, and the like. As for the liberty of Hunt∣ing, he grants it to all; in regard there are such multitudes of Wild Beasts that breed up and down in the over-grown Woods and high Mountains, that it is not onely troublesome but dangerous to find out their haunts: by which means that
<PB N="201" REF="89"/>
which in other Countries is a Pleasure, to the <HI>Abessines</HI> be∣comes a Toyl and Detriment.</P>
<P>One thing is much to be admir'd, and rare ev'n among the <HI>Turks,</HI> which is, that no private person, whether Peasant or Lord, except some few can call any thing his own. All the Lands and Farms in the Country belong to the King, and are held by the Subjects onely at the Kings pleasure, so that no man takes it amiss, if the King takes away their Lands and bestowes them upon another as he pleases himself; and that not onely after two or three years, but also the same year they were given: So that it often happens that one man ploughs, and another man sowes. Whence it comes to pass, that they are more submissive to their Kings, then a Servant to his Ma∣ster, or a Vassal to his Lord: they serve him in Peace and War; and bring him Presents according to their Ability, in hopes of obtaining new Farms, or for fear of losing those they have. For being commanded out of possession, they never grumble, but presently obey without the least distast against the King, or envy to the person that succeeds in their Room. Custome and long use prevailing, while they see the same happening to others. However there are some ancient and Illustrious Families, especially in <HI>Tigra,</HI> who enjoy by right of Inheritance not only Lands and Possessions purchas'd by their Ancestors, but some certain Prefectures also, retaining their ancient Title; as <HI>Bahr-Nagash, Shum Serawè Sirè, Temben,</HI> and others; as also <HI>Cantiba</HI> in <HI>Dembea;</HI> over whom the King claims no other Authority, than to confer the public Employments every two year, or yearly, or as he pleases, upon others; yet so as that they be of the same Family.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> Of the Power and Revenues of the <HI>Habessine</HI> Kings.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Power of the <HI>Habessine</HI> Kings formerly great; Formidable to their Neighbours; it fail'd after the <HI>Saracens</HI> came in Play. Yet strong at home till the <HI>Adelan</HI> War, and Incursions of the <HI>Gallans.</HI> Easie to be restor'd. The wayes and means. Our Princes unkind to Forraign Chri∣stians.

The King has enough to supply him both in Peace and War.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SO great and so absolute a Power, and so uncontroulable a Dominion over their Subjects, one would think should render the Kings of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> vastly Potent: and so no doubt it would, if other things were correspondent. Certainly of old it was vastly great, when they kept their Courts at<NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Nonnosus</HI> in <HI>Bibliothec. Phot.</HI> n. 3. calls the <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> the <HI>Homerites</HI> and <HI>Saracens</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the stoutest of the Nations at that time.</NOTE> <HI>Axuma;</HI> for there was no considerable Empire near then to withstand their Fortune: and for that cause the adjoyning petty-Princes were all at the devotion of the <HI>Habessinian</HI> Kings. But as to what several have written, through mistake or misapplication of the name,<NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Scal.</HI> in his notes <HI>ad Comp. Eccl. Ethiop,</HI> but I know not by what Autho∣rity.</NOTE> of their Expeditions into the <HI>North</HI> parts of <HI>Asia,</HI> they are all meer fables and figments. Yet this cannot be deny'd, but that formerly they were very terrible to the neighbouring Nations: for they made seve∣ral Expeditions into<NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Arabians</HI> wont to use this Computation. From the Invasions of the <HI>Abessines.</HI> For so <HI>Altcodajus.</HI> They computed their years from the <HI>Arabians</HI> invading <HI>Abessina.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Arabia.</HI></P>
<P>We have already mention'd the Famous and Successful War with <HI>Caleb</HI> made against the <HI>Homerites.</HI> With no less Renown, King <HI>Cyriacus</HI> hearing of the Christian Persecution in <HI>Egypt,</HI> led a very numerous Army against the<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">So the <HI>Mahometans</HI> call themselves.</NOTE> <HI>Muslims.</HI> Wherefore <HI>Merwan,</HI> Captain of the <HI>Saracens,</HI> upon promise
<PB N="203" REF="90"/>
of mitigating his severity, besought the Patriarch of <HI>Alexan∣dria,</HI> to perswade the King to desist from his design; which he did, and stopp'd the Progress of the King, till he<NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Elmacinus</HI> Hist. of the <HI>Saracens</HI> l. c. 17.</NOTE> heard that the Christians were better us'd. Which tho it be re∣ported of the King of <HI>Nubia,</HI> yet several Authors attribute the same to the King of the <HI>Abissines;</HI> in regard that by the <HI>Nubian</HI> Geographer, <HI>Nubia</HI><NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bochapts</HI> Sacred Geography l. 2. c. 23. However most certainly <HI>Cyriacus</HI> had another name.</NOTE> extended to the Fountains of <HI>Nile. Gregory</HI> also affirm'd the same, and that the History was to be seen in his Country. But when the <HI>Saracens</HI> grew stronger, and had invaded the Neighbouring Kingdoms, the <HI>Abissines,</HI> relinquishing <HI>Axuma,</HI> and turning the force of their Arms against the more upland parts of <HI>Africa,</HI> enlarg'd their Empire by the Overthrow of several weak and effeminate Nations, no more regarding forraign Countries, or the sub∣duing of far distant Regions: which was the reason that af∣ter that, they perform'd nothing that was memorable abroad. However they were Potent at home, and had under them several petty-Princes that were their Tributaries. And in this Greatness they flourish'd, in the time of <HI>Helena</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> till it was not only shaken by that Dreadful Warr with the <HI>A∣delans;</HI> but so overturn'd, that it never could recover it self af∣terwards. For about that time the <HI>Gallans</HI> also breaking out, and never after that subdu'd, layd wast and harrass'd the most Opulent and most Noble Provinces of the Empire: and still to this day every year gain upon the rest with their continual Incursions. However, that Power which yet remains is so considerable, that if they would but make use of the Arts and Arms of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> they might not onely subdue those <HI>Barbarians,</HI> but also recover their Lost Dominions. For a Kingdom well order'd within, under such a Monarch, where the People are under so much subjection; so large a liberty to do well or ill; if Concord and Unity attended these Op∣portunities, together with a constant method of Counsels, it is impossible, but that they must soon prevail over a wandring Nation, divided among themselves into so many Tribes and Factions. All their truculent and savage fury would be in vain, if the streights of the Mountains were but well forti∣fy'd
<PB N="204" REF="91"/>
and guarded with Field-Pieces. They should also send forth several Colonies, and give them a tast of the Blessings of Peace, by which the wildest of Nations oft-times grow tame. But which is more than all, and which the <HI>Habessines</HI> most earnestly desire, Towns should be built, and replenish'd with people, and an increase of Wealth be permitted by the En∣couragement of Arts and Arms. Lastly, if the Kng would remit something of his Prerogative which he has over the Estates of the Subject, and reserving those Lands which are already till'd, to himself, would distribute to his Souldiers and the rest of his People such Lands as should be won from the Enemy, every one his proportion, and grant them an ir∣revocable Inheritance of such Lands; settling also Duke∣doms and Earldoms in fee-simple out of the Conquer'd Coun∣tries, upon his Nobility, and best deserving Captains, no doubt but in a short time, it would prove the most flourish∣ing Kingdom in <HI>Asia,</HI> greatly to the propagation of the Chri∣stian Religion.</P>
<P>And it seems but reason, that in the settling and ordering his Kingdom, the <HI>Habessinian</HI> Prince should be advis'd and assisted by the <HI>European</HI> Princes, not onely out of Christian Charity and hopes of propagating Christianity over <HI>Africa,</HI> but also to lessen the Power of the <HI>Turk,</HI> which would fol∣low, were the Dominion of the Red Sea but wrested out of his hands, and the Commerce of <HI>Egypt</HI> spoyl'd. Ah! what pity it is, that we should be so ill affected towards other Christian Nations, that unless they are of the same Opinion with us in all points of Divinity; or unless they promise us large Rewards, or an ample share of their Profits, we can pa∣tiently look on, and see them perish, while the most invete∣rate Enemies of the Christian Faith are enrich'd with the spoyls of their Wealth; not considering that in the end the mischief will redound to our selves: and that we shall one day, unless God in mercy prevent it, dearly pay for our Dis∣sensions.</P>
<P>Thus we forbore to assist the <HI>Grecian</HI> Emperours, and seve∣ral of the Eastern Princes, till they became at last a prey to the <HI>Ottomans.</HI> Thus, while none of Us lay'd it to heart, <HI>Egypt</HI> was reduc'd under the Power of the <HI>Turk;</HI> a vast addition to their Empire: as if it were a Crime to breed up Doggs to hunt the Wolves. Now the reason why the <HI>Abissines</HI> do not court with greater ardour the Alliances of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> is
<PB N="205" REF="91"/>
plain: for it is to be attributed either to their ignorance, or their difference in Opinion from the <HI>Latines.</HI> Moreover, they fail very much in this, that they permit the <HI>Turk</HI> to be Ma∣sters of the Ports and Ilands of the Red Sea, whereby it is absolutely at their pleasure what Persons or Commodities shall pass in and out. But they understand not, that there is no Nation can be truly Powerful and Great, that does not Command some Sea-Towns.</P>
<P>As for the Revenues of the King, they are not paid in ready money, but in the natural Productions of the Countries, the most equal sort of Tribute. For some Provinces afford Gold; others Horses, Cattel, Sheep, Corn and Ox Hides, and some few, where Weavers live, send him Garments. They bring their Gold rough and unrefin'd, as they gather it up among the Sands of the Rivers, or digg it out under the Roots of Trees, or else with less Labour find it loose upon the Earth. For they know not how to coyn money, but after the ancient manner, weigh their Mettal, wherein they are many times gull'd by forraign Merchants, who frequently deny the Gold to be pure; and therefore change it for the meanest of their Commodities. How much better might the King provide for himself and his Subjects, should he with Money of his own Coyn, buy up all the Gold in his Kingdom, to his own and the great advantage of his People. <HI>Enarea</HI><NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">15000 <HI>Patachs</HI> of <HI>Portugal</HI> or <HI>German</HI> Dollars.</NOTE> pays a Thou∣sand and five hundred Ounces of Gold: formerly much more. To <HI>Susneus</HI> it pay'd but a Thousand, and sometimes but Five hundred, when the <HI>Enareans</HI> were either at Wars with the <HI>Gallans,</HI> or else embroyl'd one with another. <HI>Gojam</HI> pays every Year Eleven hundred Ounces, and some Garments, to the value of 3000 <HI>German</HI> Dollars, together with Two hun∣dred Fustian Tapestries, very broad and close woven. Formerly they also pay'd a Tribute of Horses, but <HI>Malec-Saghed</HI> remit∣ted that, to the end they might be the better able to with∣stand the <HI>Gallans.</HI> Out of <HI>Tigra</HI> he receives Five and twenty thousand Patachs. Out of <HI>Dembea</HI> Five thousand. As much out of other Kingdoms, or sometimes less. There are also several <HI>Tolls</HI> pay'd, but generally granted to the Nobility for their subsistance; except those of the high Mountain, <HI>Lamal∣mona,</HI> over which all the Merchants and Merchandize must pass from the Red Sea into <HI>Habessinia,</HI> which the King reserves
<PB N="206" REF="92"/>
to himself. He also has his Lands and Farms, from whence he is serv'd with Provisions for his Table, ten or twelve Horse-Loads at a time. Lastly, <HI>Dembea, Gojam,</HI> and <HI>Bagemdra</HI> find him Corn and Flesh. That which he receives out of <HI>Dembea</HI> is distributed among the Souldiers which have no Land, or else among the Poor. But his chief Tribute is from the Gra∣ziers, who are bound to pay him every Tenth Oxe or Cow every Three Years: which is as much as if they should pay the 30th every Year. And the whole Empire is so divided, that every Year he has his certain Tribute of Cows and Oxen. Besides, every Year every Christian Weaver pays him a Fu∣stian Garment; Every Mahumetan a <HI>Drim,</HI> or Patach, which amounts to a Thousand <HI>Imperials</HI> every Year.</P>
<P>Most certainly the Revenues of this Empire seem to be ve∣ry small, if we consider the Extent of so many Large Pro∣vinces. But on the other side we are to observe, That the Prices of all things are very low. A huge Oxe may be bought for half a Dollar. The Souldiers live upon Flesh and Fish without bread; and Servants Wages are paid in necessary Commodities not in money.</P>
<P>Again, if we consider the plenty of all things; the <HI>Abissine</HI> Emperour has enough and to spare: not that his Diadem gli∣sters with Gemms or Pearls, or that his Treasuries are full of Money; or that his Cupboards shine with Silver and Gold Plate; or that his Table is spread with Forraign Banquets while his Subjects are in want, -his Courtiers poor, and his Souldiers under penury. But he has that which suffices to afford him moderate Dyet, and slender Cloathing. Then for his Souldiers and his Warlike Subjects, that is to say, his poor People, they, detain'd at home by no delicacies, are ready still to gird on their Swords. Which they who dexte∣rously and courageously know how to weild in a good Cause, need never want Gold nor Silver, nor what ever Mortals esteem pretious and desireable.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Royal City of the <HI>Abissines,</HI> and formerly the Me∣tropolis of the whole Empire, is by the<NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">Of which <HI>Nonnosus</HI> in <HI>Bibliothec Phot. n</HI> 3. <HI>p. m.</HI> 2. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Auxuma</HI> is a very great City, and as it were the Metropolis of all <HI>Ethiopia;</HI> erroneously <HI>Chaxumo</HI> in <HI>Alvarez,</HI> c. 17.</NOTE> <HI>Habissines</HI> call'd <HI>Ascum:</HI> from whence, as we have already ob∣serv'd, they were formerly call'd <HI>Axumites.</HI> Of old this City was adorn'd with most beautiful Structures, a fair Palace, and a Cathedral proudly vaunting her Obelisks, Sculptures, and several sumptuous Edifices. Some of the Pillars are still to be seen, with Inscriptions of unknown Letters, remaining ar∣guments of their Antiquity, now demolish'd by the Wars, or defac'd with Age. The City it self, now totally ruin'd, looks more like a Village, than a Town of Note; <HI>so fading and in∣constant are those things which men account most durable.</HI> How many Cities, how many Monuments now lye in ashes, whose Founders are well known? and how many are yet in being, whose Founders are unknown? As for this, it began to fall to decay by degrees, presently after that the Kings of <HI>Habes∣sinia</HI> relinquish'd it, and remov'd their Court from thence, as being depriv'd of those advantages that attend the abodes of Princes. Thus the Seat of the Empire being Translated to <HI>Byzantium,</HI> the <HI>West</HI> was neglected. And the same Fate, no doubt, had certainly befallen <HI>Rome,</HI> had it not bin sustain'd by the Care of the Bishops, now the <HI>Roman</HI> Pontiffs. In the time of the <HI>Adelan</HI> Warr, the Revolt of the Vice-Roy of <HI>Ti∣gra</HI> in the Raign of King <HI>Menas;</HI> and lastly, when the <HI>Turks</HI>
<PB N="208" REF="93" MS="y"/>
invaded that Country, it was totally lay'd wast; and now can scarcely shelter a hundred Inhabitants: onely the Ruines still remain, to testifie that once it was great and populous. It is Seated in the Fourteenth degree and a half of Northern Latitude, Encircled with pleasant and fertile Fields which afford a Prospect becoming a Royal Mansion. It lies di∣stant from the Red-Sea Five and forty <HI>Portugal</HI> Leagues, or six or Seaven tiresom days Journey by reason of the Moun∣tains that lye between. The antient things of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> were wont to be here inaugurated; nor would <HI>Susneus</HI> admit of his Coronation in any other place, though when he related the particulars of the Ceremonies to the Commander of the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> he could not but laugh at them, as ridicu∣lous himself, <HI>For many things are to be done by Princes to please the Vulgar, which to others may seem superfluous,</HI> Such as were for the most part the <HI>Solemn Ceremonies of the Antients inven∣ted by mean Capacities, but retain'd by the more prudent. Tellezius</HI> thus sets them down. When <HI>Susneus</HI> was to be Crown'd, first the Masters of the Ceremonies, read to the King out of their Memorandums, how and in what order every thing was to be perform'd. The Army being drawn up, the Foot march'd first: then follow'd the Horse with their Trap∣pings: after them the Courtiers Comb'd, and neatly habi∣ted: presently appear'd the Emperour himself upon a stately Prauncer, clad with a close Purple Damascene Tunic, and over that a magnificent <HI>Attalic</HI> Vestment, with narrow Sleeves hanging down to the ground. When they came to a great Stone engraven with Forraign Characters, not far from the Church of <HI>Axuma,</HI> near to which the Solemnities of the Inau∣guration us'd to be perform'd, the Emperour with all the Courtiers alighting from their Horses, stood upon the Ground that was spread with rich Carpets. At what time the Vir∣gins of <HI>Axuma,</HI> holding a Silken Cord cross the Street stopp'd the Way, and as the King press'd to go forwards, they hin∣dred him, and ask'd him, <HI>Who he was?</HI> who answering, <HI>I am the King of the Israelites.</HI> They reply'd, <HI>Surely thou art not our King.</HI> Which said, he retir'd smiling. At length being ask'd a third time; he reply'd, <HI>I am the King of Sion:</HI> and drawing forth his Cimitar, cut the Cord: which done, the Virgin cry'd out, <HI>Of a certainty, thou art our King of Sion.</HI> Pre∣sently all the Guns they have are fir'd, and the neighbouring Mountains rang with loud Acclamations; the Drums beat
<PB N="209" REF="93" MS="y"/>
to the noise of the Flutes, and the Trumpets fill'd the Air with harmonious Levets. Which done, the <HI>Metropolitan Simeon</HI> accompany'd with all the Ecclesiastical Orders of Clerks, Monks, and Canons, singing several Songs and Hymns, conducted the King to the first Porch of the Church, and there set the Diadem upon his Head. The King being crown'd, if it may be so call'd; proceeded forward into the Temple, and there receiv'd the Eucharist; which having done he rode back to the Camp with his Diadem upon his head. For in <HI>Ethiopia</HI> they use no Scepter. Nor is the Crown any other than a Hatt twice doubled, with an Azure colour'd Silken broad brimm trimm'd with Gold and Silver Plates, in the likeness Lillies; with a row of false stones glistering between every Plate.</P>
<P>Besides <HI>Axuma,</HI> there are no Cities in <HI>Habessinia,</HI> and but few Towns. In the Kingdom of <HI>Tigra, Dobarva</HI> is the Seat of the Vice-Roys: <HI>Fremona,</HI> the first Residence of the Fathers of the Society, enlarg'd by the <HI>Portugueses. Gubay,</HI> a Town in <HI>Dembea,</HI> where the Queen resides. <HI>Nanina</HI> in <HI>Gojam,</HI> long inhabited by the <HI>Portugueses. Macana celace,</HI> in <HI>Amhara.</HI> To reck'n up more is not worth the while: neither is it certain whether those already mention'd are standing or no. For in regard of the meanness of the Building, there is nothing of invitation to hinder their being deserted and layd wast by the Inhabitants themselves; in regard the <HI>Habessines</HI> choose ra∣ther to live after the manner of Villagers, not caring that their Houses should joyn one to another; which saves them many Suits in Law. For they never fear any Actions about Party-Walls, stopping up of Lights, or Nusances of Water-Courses. In places that are fertile and till'd, you shall see the Fields, as it were, planted with Houses, which affords no unpleasant Prospect. They have neither Castles nor Forts. The Celebrated Mountains of <HI>Amhara</HI> are their onely Cita∣dels, where the Kings Children were formerly committed to Custody. The <HI>Habessines</HI> wonder to hear of so many great Cities among Us. For they do not believe the Country can afford Timber and Food sufficient for so many Houses, nor the Cattel that must support such Numbers of People, remain∣ing so long in one place. For they pitch their Tents up and down the Country, and cut down and make havock of what ever they have need of, without any consideration of the dammage, or regard to the future. For they neither Navi∣gate
<PB N="210" REF="94"/>
their own Rivers, neither do they know what belongs to Carriage or Stores; living without any care of to Mor∣row.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XII.</HI> Of the Kings Court, his Titles, and his Court-Officers.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Kings live in Tents: <HI>P. Pays</HI> built a Palace. The Kings Table. Wo∣men attend: Plain dyet. The King and the Nobility cramm'd. They drink after they have done: They read the whole Psalter before meales. The ancient manner of receiving Ambassadors: now chang'd. Formerly two Court Officers: discontinnu'd. The <HI>Ras</HI> now chief Minister in Peace and War. Officers beside.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFter the Kings of <HI>Habessinia</HI> left <HI>Axuma,</HI> they never had any constant Mansion, nor any Palaces, but contented themselves to live in Tents. But at length <HI>Peter Pays</HI> built the King a Palace after the <HI>European</HI> manner, which cost him an incredible deal of Labour and Industry; for that in regard of the want of Artists, he was forc'd to teach them every thing, and to look after the Work like a Master-Buil∣der. He chose to build this House in a most commodious and delightful place call'd <HI>Gorgora,</HI> being a kind of Peninsula, almost surrounded by the <HI>Tzanic</HI> Lake, where the King was wont to take up his Winter-Quarters, and contriv'd it very spacious and beautiful, with Rooms of State, Bed-Chambers, Galleries, Battlements and Balconies, which yielded a most pleasant Prospect over the Lake, and the Neighbouring Fields. Insomuch, that it was not inferiour to the Country Palaces of some of our <HI>Europeans</HI> Princes. The <HI>Abessines</HI> were amaz'd when they saw one story rais'd above another, which they thought could never have bin done: and call'd it <HI>House upon House.</HI> Nor till that time did they believe the Fathers, when they told them of the numerous and splendid Palaces, Sumptuous Cathedrals, and Stately Monasteries in <HI>Europe.</HI> For those things they related to the <HI>Abessines,</HI> to make them in love with the Magnificence and Majesty of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church.</P>
<P>The Garniture of the Kings Table is much different from
<PB N="211" REF="94"/>
ours. For no person is admitted into the Room while the King is at Dinner; or if any of the Nobility be invited, they must stay till the King rises: then they take their places at the same Table, and eat the Kings Leavings, which is look'd upon as a very great Honour. Yet the Fathers of the Society were admitted to Dine by themselves, in the same Room next to <HI>Susneus</HI>'s Bed-Chamber. To which purpose there were two low little round Tables, about Eighteen Spans in Compass, brought in to the Room and plac'd upon the Ground which was spread with Carpets; one lesser for the King, another bigger for the Fathers, but without Table-Cloaths or Napkins: instead of which they made use of thin Wafers made of Wheat or Rie past. So that their Table∣cloaths serv'd them for Bread, which there was no need for the Servants to take away, fold up, or wash: no Trenchers, Knives, Forks, nor Spoons: no Salt-seller, no Pepper or Su∣gar-box; nothing of Extravagant was there to be seen: A great Ease to them in time of Warr; to us an impediment, while so many Carts, so many Waggons are requir'd to carry Kitchin Utensils, and Kitchin Officers, to pleasure our Luxu∣ry. The Meat is serv'd up by Women, not in Gold or Silver Dishes, but in broad Earthen Platters, which would never tempt an <HI>European</HI> Thief. They are made of black Clay, with covers of Straw neatly woven and painted. The meat is very ordinary, Flesh and Broths of several sorts boyl'd after their fashion. So soon as the Dishes are marshall'd; the Hangings are presently let down, lest any one should see the King while he is eating: and truly there is good Reason why. For, the King and the chief Nobility, a thing you would think almost incredible, account it a great trouble to lift their hands to their mouths. And therefore the Children belonging to Court, take the meat and put it in their mouths, and if the Gobbets be too bigg, they thrust 'em in, as they do that cramm Capons. The crumms that fall, sometimes they put again i' their chopps after they are well soak'd in the Broth. A way of eating that may well deserve a good thick covering: as being a sight, that would certainly cause our squeamish Stomachs, that will hardly eat off of one an∣others Trenchers, to rise a hungry. But this is common both to Lord and Peasant, that they never drink till they have done feeding.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="95"/>One thing we must not omit, which is, that they always read Prayers both before and after meals: a thing that some of our Courtiers are in a manner asham'd of, who will hard∣ly tarry to hear a short Grace; while here you shall have the whole <HI>Psalter</HI> repeated at their great Feasts, without any in∣convenience to the Guests: For he whose Office it is, distri∣butes to every one a part. The King and they that are ac∣custom'd to it, know their proper time. The larger <HI>Psalmes</HI> are divided among more, the shorter to one singly. And thus by several, the whole <HI>Psalter</HI> is read, as it were, in a moment. For the <HI>Psalter</HI> is made use of by all: neither have they any other Book for dayly Prayer.</P>
<P>Their manner of giving Audience to Ambassadors is diffe∣rent from what it was in former times. For <HI>Alvarez</HI> relates how that after long waiting, and a deal of haughty formali∣ty, the <HI>Portugal</HI> Embassadour, <HI>Lodowic Limaeus,</HI> was four times ask'd <HI>From whence he came?</HI> and that he receiv'd no other an∣swer the first day, but that <HI>They were Welcome:</HI> nor were they admitted to the King; and yet Presents were to be left. Nor was the Embassadour to be Visited by any one, before he had kiss'd the Kings hands. At length, after he had bin several times call'd, he was first admitted to discourse the King, the Hangings being let down between them; and at last, with much ado, to see and salute the King. Of which the chief Reason was thought to be, because he had brought no Pre∣sent (for it is not lawful to appear before the Eastern or <HI>Afri∣can</HI> Kings, without an acknowledgment) or else because he wanted the Kings Credentials. Which superbness is now a days layd aside; for that being humbled by so many Losses and Calamities, they begin to reckon Urbanity and Civility among the rest of the Vertues.</P>
<P>Among the Court Employments, the chiefest Dignity was that of the Person who was call'd <HI>Bahtudet,</HI> of whom one was of the <HI>Right</HI> hand, and the other of the <HI>Left.</HI> They were the chief Ministers of State, and manag'd all Affairs, and were entrusted with all the Kings Secrets; with them alone the King consulted; few others being admitted into his Pre∣sence: as if Majesty were more Venerable when conceal'd. But afterwards so much Greatness in Subjects began to grow
<PB N="213" REF="95"/>
irksome to the Kings; and some there are also that abuse their Power: few men being able to contain themselves within those Bounds of moderation, to be able to do all things, and yet not to covet all things. For there are many Examples of those, who out of a desire of preserving their Greatness, have requited their Masters with ill Turns for Fa∣vours of the highest nature; making use of that authority which they receiv'd from their Princes, to their mischief. By which means <HI>Kings</HI> have bin overwhelm'd by the hatred of the People; or else have bin forc'd to pull down that Great∣ness with extream hazard, which they themselves advanc'd. Those Princes act more prudent that keep the Power in their own hands, never trusting to the Management of one single Person. Neither are they less provident Ministers, who ne∣ver affect it: For the Grand Affairs of a Kingdom are more safely and easily manag'd by Plurality.</P>
<P>To these succeeded another Chief Officer whom the <HI>Ethi∣opians</HI> call <HI>Ras,</HI> from the Arabic word which signifies a <HI>Head.</HI> The reason of whose institution at first, was for the Command of the Army. But as Warlike Command, and Martial Fame excell all other accomplishments; it came to pass in a short time, that these chief Generals advanc'd themselves above all others, to govern the Kings Counsels, and so by degrees to be the chief Ministers of State for the management of all Affairs, both Forraign and Domestic, such a one was <HI>Ras-Athanasius,</HI> who first deposed <HI>Zadenghel,</HI> and then <HI>Jacob,</HI> so that <HI>Susneus</HI> did not hold it convenient to confer so great a dignity upon any person, unless it were by his Brother by the Mothers side, by name <HI>Ras-Selach.</HI> Next to him, there are two Comptrollers of the Court. The upper Comptroller, who is called <HI>Bellatenot-Gueta,</HI> as much as to say Master of the Officers, whose jurisdiction reaches all Inferior Vice-Roys, Prefects, Governors of Provinces, and Judges. The other is called <HI>Dakaka Bellatenot-Gueta</HI> who comtroles the Houshold Servants, the Grooms and such like, who are ge∣nerally of mean Condition, and of several Nations. Slaves also set free are admitted to Dignities and Offices. For the Kings believe their Slaves, when freed, will be most faithful, as owing to their Fortunes to none alive besides.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="96"/>Next in Dignity to the Court Officers, are the Vice-Roys, and Princes, Camp-Masters, Senators, and Kings-Counsel∣lors, who are called the lesser Judges and Magistrates with∣out any distinction of Superior or Inferior Judges: for they have equal Jurisdiction and Cognizance of all Crimes. The Captain of the Kings Guard they call the <HI>Guardian of the Fire,</HI> not without reason comparing the King to Fire. <HI>For that they who are Servants to Kings and Princes, receive heat and warmth from them as from the Fire; though if they act not prudently, they may chance to be cruelly burnt.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIII.</HI> Of the King's Camp.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Kings Tent described: The Camp pitch'd in great order. The same al∣ways. It consists of four parts: formerly in <HI>Shewa,</HI> now in <HI>Dembea.</HI> How large. As it were a Marching City; the great Power of the Camp-Masters.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHatever others have feign'd concerning any other Royal City or Metropolis, besides <HI>Axumas,</HI> are meer Fables. For the Kings of <HI>Habessinia</HI> live continually in Tents, whether it be that they are not accustomed to Houses, or that their frequent Wars and tedious marches will not ad∣mit of long rest. The Kings Pavilion is a very large one, of white colour placed in the middle of the Camp; there being a large space of Ground left void round about it; as well to prevent the Casualties of Fire, as also to receive the Horses of the Nobility and those that bring Provisions. Next to him, the Grandees, the Friends and kindred of the <HI>King</HI> and the rest of the Courtiers pitch up their Apartments. The whole Camp consists of four parts, every one of which has his Camp-Master. The first part is call'd the <HI>Front;</HI> and the Camp-Master is call'd <HI>Fit-aurari.</HI> The Hindmost part is call'd <HI>Chuala.</HI> The First Camp-Master goes before to take up convenient Ground where there is store of Wood and Grass, chiefly near some River or Lake, to prevent want of Water. Having chosen out his Ground; he fixes a Pole in the Earth with the Royal Banner at the Topp; upon the sight whereof, they that measure for the Nobility, set up
<PB N="215" REF="96"/>
their Masters Lodgings. After them the Common Soul∣diery, and others that follow the Camp either for Victuals, or else upon business. And thus in a few hours time the whole Camp appears in the same Order as it was before. For every one knowes his place and his proportion, there being never any alteration of the Order, but the same Streets and Lanes, the same distance of Tents, so that were it not for the variation of the Prospect, other Mountains, other Rivers, and another Face of the Country, you would think your self still in the same place. When the Cryer has once proclaim'd the day of Removal, they presently know how to pack up their Baggage, and in what order to march without any more ado; who are to march in the Front, who in the Rear; who on the Right, who on the Left hand: so that all things are done without Noise or Tumult.</P>
<P>Neither is there any thing which more commends the In∣dustry of the <HI>Abessines.</HI> For what they have acquir'd by long use and continual War, they still retain; never pester'd with confusion either marching or sitting still. The constant disposal and largeness of the Camp may be understood from hence, that the same Dialect and the same words continue in the same Streets and Quarters: in other Quarters another sort of words, and a different Dialect: as for <HI>Dala,</HI> a word used in the Front of the Camp, which signifies to <HI>put in;</HI> the Vulgar in the Rear Quarter say, <HI>Tshammara.</HI> Of old, before the <HI>Gallans</HI> conquer'd it, the Camp was pitch'd in <HI>Shewa,</HI> a fertile and most plentiful Countrey. But for the most part in <HI>December,</HI> and that for three or four years together in one place. In the beginning of <HI>Susneus</HI>'s Reign in the year 1607, they pitch'd at <HI>Coga.</HI> Thence they remov'd to <HI>Gorgora,</HI> in the year 1612, from thence to <HI>Dancaza;</HI> and lastly to <HI>Guen∣dra</HI> which place, <HI>Bernier</HI> because he had heard perhaps that it was the Residence of the King, calls the Metropolis of <HI>Ethiopia;</HI> of which perhaps in a few years there will be no∣thing to be seen.</P>
<P>These Camps take up a vast deal of room, as well in the Summer as in the Winter, for they do not onely contain the Souldiers, but their Wives and their Children, whose work it is to bake their Bread, and make their Hydromel. So that the weak and helpless multitude far exceeds the number of
<PB N="216" REF="97"/>
the Souldiery. Nor are they without Merchants and Trades∣men of all sorts, besides Slaves and Lackeys, necessary for such a Multitude: So that the Camp looks more like an Am∣bulatory City, and moving Houses, then a Martial Camp. So many Tents and Pavilions seeming a far off to repre∣sent the Prospect of some great Town. But less wonder∣ful is that which is reported out of <HI>India;</HI> That near the Island of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> there are certain Cities, if they may be so call'd, which are always swimming, and yet great Markets and Fairs are kept therein; and many People live there who have no other Country or Habitation.</P>
<P>Now for the Camp masters whom the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> call <HI>Sebea Catine,</HI> they carry a great sway in managing the Succession of the Kings, and affairs of greatest moment. The Kings also themselves are guided by them in making and abrogating Laws; and generally they are the first springs of Faction and Sedition. And as formerly the <HI>Pretorean</HI> Bands gave Laws to Prince and People, so among the <HI>Habessines</HI> the effect of all Consultations good or bad derive themselves from the Camp.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIV.</HI> Of the Military Affairs of the <HI>Habessines.</HI></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Continual war. The Winter causes a Truce. The <HI>Habessines</HI> good Soldiers. Strong and active. They serve without pay. They plunder the Countries as they march. The <HI>Gallans</HI> secur'd by their Poverty. The <HI>Habessines</HI> igno∣rant in Fire-Arms. Few Muskets, and fewer Musketeteers. Their Armies consist most of Foot. Light Armour. Drumms us'd by the Horse. Their Weapons. Bad Discipline: because they count it no shame to flie. Their Onsets furious. Their Rocks are their Fortresses. The King Commands in chief. Theives unpunish'd.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THat the <HI>Habessines</HI> are a Warlike People and continually exercis'd in War, we have already declar'd: neither is there any respit but what is caus'd by the Winter, at what time by reason of the Inundations of the Rivers, they are forc'd to be quiet. For they have neither Ships nor Boats: neither do they know how to make Bridges to com∣mand a passage over their violent Streams. Concerning which, <HI>Gregory</HI> wrote to me in these words.</P>
<P><HI>There is no making War in</HI> Ethiopia <HI>in the Winter time; neither does the Enemy attack us, nor we them; by reason of the great falls of Rain and the Inundations of the Rivers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tellezius</HI> also further testifies, That the <HI>Habessines</HI> are good Souldiers. They ride and manage a Horse well; and rea∣dily take Arms; as well in obedience to their Soveraign, as for other causes already mention'd. They are strong, They endure hunger and thrist beyond belief, and with lit∣tle sustenance can brook any unseasonable sort of weather. They serve without pay: contented with honour and ap∣plause, and such Lands, as the King after the Roman Cu∣stom bestows upon the well deserving. Therefore they must certainly be thought to sight much more generously and faithfully in the defence of their Countrey then Hire∣lings. They expect no part of the Enemies Booty, nor no redemption, and therefore never serve them in the Field. and because they know not the art of protracting a War, therefore they never are sparing of themselves to return home rich. However the Poverty of the Souldiers impo∣verishes
<PB N="218" REF="98"/>
the Countries through which they march. For in regard it is a difficult thing to carry Provisions over such steep and rugged Mountains, and long wayes, they take by force what is not freely given them; and by that means lay wast their own Countries no less then their Enemies: whereby the poor Countrey people are constrain'd to turn Souldiers, and so taught to deal by others, as they were dealt with them∣selves. For which reason they neither can vanquish nor make any long pursuit after the <HI>Gallans;</HI> who being retir'd with their Droves, the Pursuers find nothing left behind but Lands untill'd, and empty Cottages. So invincible a Fortress is Poverty to withstand the stoutest Enemy. But, as we have said already, Those <HI>Gallans</HI> might easily be van∣quish'd, did but the <HI>Habessines</HI> know the use of Muskets. <HI>Tel∣lezius</HI> writes, that they have among them about fifteen hun∣dred Musquets, but not above four Musqueteers, and they but very bad Fire-men neither; neither do the Comman∣ders know how to place and order them to the best advan∣tage: and therefore after they have once discharg'd, the Enemy rushes on so furiously before they can charge again, that they they are forc'd to to throw their Musquets away: and then another thing is; they have but very little Pow∣der.</P>
<P>The biggest Army which the King brings now into the Field hardly amounts to Forty thousand Men, among which he has not above Four or Five thousand Horse, the rest are all Foot. Their horses are couragious and mettlesome, but they never get upon their backs till they are ready to charge the Enemy: at other times they ride their Mules, and lead their Horses. They are slightly arm'd after the manner of the antient <HI>Velites;</HI> and tho their Stirrups are no bigger then onely to thrust in their great Toes, least if the Horse should fall, their feet should be hung in the Stirup, yet they sit ve∣ry fast. Their Weapons are Swords and Darts, as also Launces and short Javelins, with which they fight at a distance; after which they dispute it hand to hand with their Swords or Launces, and Bucklers. Their War like Musick for the Horse are Drums much bigger then ours, and the King's, which are the biggest, go by the name of the <HI>Bear</HI> and the <HI>Lyon.</HI> Besides which, several Hornes and Fifes march before Him. They for the most part, are
<PB N="219" REF="98"/>
arm'd with two Spears, of which they dart away the one at a distance, and maintain a close fight with the other, de∣fending themselves with their Bucklers. The Horse never fight a foot, nor the Foot a horseback: a practice very necessary in such a Country, where many times there is no use of Horse. In brief, the Military Discipline of the <HI>Habessines</HI> is very irre∣gular; rather the fault of the Captains that know not how to command them, than of the Souldiers. For they run away without any fear of Infamy or Punishment: neither do they know how to rally when they are once disorder'd; so that the first array being broken, the rest are carry'd away like a Torrent: neither do they strengthen their Wings with Re∣serves; neither do they separate the Veterans from the Raw Souldiers, disheartning the Courage of the one, by the unequal mixture of the other. The fury of the first Onset for the most part wins the Field: for which reason, the <HI>Gallans</HI> surpassing the <HI>Habessines</HI> in heat and violence, have so often vanquish'd them. They are not easily perswaded to avoid the Combat, believing it sloathful and dastardly to tire out an Enemy by delay, and wait for opportunities. Which has bin the Ruin of many of their Kings, that have joyn'd Battel with more Cou∣rage, than Prudent Advice. The Kings themselves, for the most part bred up in the field, command their own Armies themselves; or else they create a <HI>Ras,</HI> to command in their stead.</P>
<P>One thing more remains behind, That this Country is ve∣ry much infested with Robbers as well as Enemies; who many times robb in Troops like Souldiers, and very much in∣fest the Roads; and this without any searching after, or care taken to punish them; by reason that the King and the Gover∣nours being wholly busied with continual Wars, have no time to ridd the Nation of these Vermin, who being pursu'd, pre∣sently shelter themselves among the Rocks and Mountains.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE shall forbear to set down over-ancient or incer∣tain Relations, concerning the Expeditions of the Kings of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> into <HI>Egypt,</HI> in regard it does not ap∣pear to us, what part of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> those Writers mean; or how far the Empire of the <HI>Abessines</HI> of old extended. For those things which Historians have deliver'd to memory in refe∣rence to the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> adjoyning upon <HI>Egypt,</HI> are not presently to be apply'd to the <HI>Ethiopians.</HI> For that the distance between <HI>Egypt</HI> and our <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> comprehends Eight or nine degrees, or a hunder'd <HI>German</HI> Miles and more. In which wide space, <HI>Nubia</HI> was seated, so that there might be Kings of other <HI>Ethi∣opick</HI> Nations next to that. And therefore till we see the Histories themselves of the <HI>Abissines,</HI> we are unwilling to publish Incertainties for Certainties. But that the <HI>Habessines</HI> did make several Famous Expeditions into <HI>Arabia,</HI> is a thing not to be question'd; insomuch, that some of them have made a Computation of their Years from thence: and that the Kingdom of the <HI>Homerites</HI> was totally subdu'd by <HI>Caleb,</HI> we have already declar'd. To omit then several other Wars wag'd with their Neighbours, the Stories of which are to us unknown: as for example, that with the <HI>Nubians</HI> in the 25th Year of the former Century, recorded by <HI>Alvarez;</HI> the most lamentable and most fatal was that War which they enter'd
<PB N="221" REF="99"/>
into with the <HI>Adelans</HI> their Ancient Enemies. True it is in∣deed, that in the beginning of his Raign, <HI>David</HI> vanquish'd them in several Battels. But after the <HI>Turks</HI> had vanquish'd <HI>Egypt,</HI> and some Ports of the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> the <HI>Adelans,</HI> strengthen'd by their assistance, turn'd the Scale of Fortune, and were al∣ways Victors. For King <HI>Adelis</HI> sent one <HI>Ahmed,</HI> a <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> vulgarly call'd <HI>Grainus,</HI> or <HI>Grannus,</HI> that is to say, <HI>Left-handed,</HI> with an Army to invade <HI>Habessinia,</HI> and revenge the Losses of the <HI>Adelans.</HI> He, about the Year 1526, subdu'd all <HI>Fata∣gara.</HI> For the first two Years the War was carry'd on with various Success; but the next Twelve Years to the Year 1540, at what time King <HI>David</HI> deceas'd, the <HI>Habessines</HI> had the worst of it. The King having lost the choicest of his Kingdoms, and his Second Son <HI>Menas,</HI> who was taken Prisoner, languish'd out the rest of his days in the Rock <HI>Da∣mus.</HI> And indeed the <HI>Habessines</HI> were brought to that low and miserable Condition, that they began to despair of their Countrey. For such are the Lamentations which we find made by those that liv'd at <HI>Rome,</HI> in the Epilogue printed after the Gospel of St. <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Not without reason do we weep, when we call to mind the Captivity of our Brethren, our Countrey layd wast, Our Temples Burnt, our Books and our Sanctuaries consum'd with Fire, and the Profanation of our Monasteries by that wicked and impious</HI> Grainus, <HI>a Companion for Goats, a Perscutor and Invader of the Sheep, from</HI> Waigaci, <HI>to the Red Sea.</HI></P>
<P>Among the Causes of such a Torrent of Calamities, these may be reck'nd not to be the least: for that the King, van∣quish'd by his own sluggish humour, had given himself whol∣ly up to the Temptations of Pleasure; so dedicated to Wo∣men, that he permitted some of them to have their Idols in his Palace. Next, the <HI>Turks,</HI> out of their inbred hatred to Christianity, had supply'd their <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Friend with Fire-Arms, and such as knew well how to use them; whose Thunder, then by the <HI>Abessines</HI> first heard, they were not able to endure; nor did they know how to cure the Wounds which the Bullets made, as not being accustom'd to them: besides, that on the other side, the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> so nu∣merously abounding throughout <HI>Abessinia,</HI> favourably every where entertain'd those of their own Sect. Many also of

the <HI>Abessines</HI> themselves, following, as is usual, the Fortune of the Victor, forsook their Native Soveraign: So that now every thing threaten'd utter destruction and desolation, when the King, lurking among the Rocks, began to bethink him∣self of craving Succour from the <HI>Portugals.</HI> To that purpose in the Year 1535, one <HI>John Bermudes,</HI> a <HI>Portuguese,</HI> was sent. Who first arriv'd at <HI>Rome</HI> in the Year 1538, where he was made Patriarch joyntly of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> and <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and after∣wards went into <HI>Portugal</HI> in the Year 1539, and there ob∣tain'd a Commission from <HI>John</HI> the Third, to the Vice-Roy of <HI>India,</HI> to send Assistance to the <HI>Abessines.</HI> Their Commander was <HI>Christopher Gomez,</HI> a Person of great Valour, who in the Month of <HI>July,</HI> in the Year 1541, enter'd the Kingdom with Six small Field-Pieces, and Four hundred and fifty Musque∣teers. At first they had a very severe March: for they wanted Horses and Teams: the Country being so wasted, that they were forc'd to carry their Luggage and Convenien∣cies upon their shoulders over most rugged and steep Moun∣tains. Nevertheless, these Souldiers, few in number, but all choice men, and coveting the honour to restore the King of <HI>Habessinia</HI> to his Kingdom and his Liberty, patiently under∣went all sorts of hardship. This caus'd a change of Fortune, so that now the late Victors were every where put to flight, astonish'd at the Execution of the Guns. In the first place, <HI>Gomez</HI> assail'd the Rock <HI>Amba-Sanet,</HI> which was thought in∣vincible, and forc'd the Enemy to quit it. Whereby he won to himself great Fame, and highly Encourag'd the <HI>Habessines.</HI> First therefore the Kings Mother, confiding in this small Force, left a certain Rock, which gave access to none, nor permitted any to ascend, but as they were drawn up or let down with Ropes, and chear'd them with her presence. <HI>Claudius,</HI> who lay sculking in the Kingdom of <HI>Shewa,</HI> had writ word he would be suddainly with them, but durst not adven∣ture through so many Numbers of the Enemies that lay in the way. So that <HI>Gomez</HI> with some few of the <HI>Habessinians,</HI> was constrain'd to bear the whole burthen of the War with a most incredible Courage. The <HI>Barbarians</HI> were not ignorant of the Gallantry of the <HI>Portugals,</HI> nor did they believe their own People had hearts sufficient to withstand the Fury of the great Guns. And therefore thinking it convenient as well to try the Disposition of <HI>Gomez,</HI> as to spie what Force he had, they sent certain Commissioners to him, pretending to blame
<PB N="223" REF="100"/>
blame his rashness, and to offer him safe Conduct, as being deceiv'd by the <HI>Abessines,</HI> if he thought fit to return. But <HI>Gomeus,</HI> as it were provok'd with the indignity they had put upon him, gave them an answer that favour'd both of fierce∣ness and contempt, telling them, <HI>That he was sent by the most Potent King of the</HI> Portugals, <HI>to revenge the Injuries done to the</HI> Habessines; <HI>and that his coming was not to return again, but to fight</HI> Grainus. The Enemies Force in that place was 15000 Foot, and 1500 Horse, together with 200 <HI>Turkish</HI> Musque∣teers, whom <HI>Gomeus</HI> had most reason to fear. But he confi∣ding in the Courage of his own men, tho but a small parcel, resolv'd upon a Battel. However, he keeps within his Camp. On the other side, <HI>Grainus</HI> would not stir, well knowing the <HI>Portugals</HI> had Provision but for a few days; which being spent, they would be forc'd to forsake the Hill where they lay En∣camp'd, and so might be easily environ'd by his Numbers. Nor did that cunning in part fail the <HI>Barbarian;</HI> for the <HI>Por∣tugals</HI> were forc'd to forsake their Camp, but could not be sur∣rounded by the Enemy, in regard their Field-Pieces and Mus∣quets struck such a Terror into the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> that they, contemning all Orders of their Captain, would not stir. And it so happen'd, that <HI>Grainus</HI> himself, riding about to force his men on, was wounded in the Hips with a Musquet Bullet, and had his Horse shot under him. The fall of the Captain quite damp'd the Courage of the Souldiers; so that they pre∣sently retreated, and the <HI>Portugals</HI> keeping the Field, look'd upon themselves as Victors. Twelve days after the <HI>Barba∣rians</HI> renew'd the Fight, for which the <HI>Portugals</HI> were pre∣par'd. While both sides fought at first with equal Success, an Accident happen'd, lamentable in sight, but yet the cause of the Victory. For while the Souldiers went with their lighted Matches to fetch Powder, a Barrel took fire, the noise of which so terrify'd the <HI>Barbarians</HI> Horses, that their Riders not being able to rule them, they disorder'd the Body of the Army; which the <HI>Portugals</HI> observing, lay'd all their force upon the <HI>Turks,</HI> who being put to flight, the rest easily fol∣low'd. However, they could not pursue them far, because they had but Eight Horses. Nevertheless the Enemies Camp was taken and plunder'd. This was the work of that Sum∣mer: for the Winter coming on, put an end to farther Action. The Winter now declining, the <HI>Portugals,</HI> who thought no∣thing too difficult for them to undertake, attack'd another
<PB N="224" REF="101"/>
steep Rock in <HI>Samen,</HI> call'd the <HI>Jews Rock,</HI> which was kept by the <HI>Adelans,</HI> with a Garrison of 1500 men. For it was large, and contain'd many Fields, Meadows, Fountains and Streams. The attempt was occasion'd by a <HI>Jew,</HI> who had bin formerly Governor of the Rock, who hearing of the Courage of the <HI>Portugals,</HI> advis'd the taking of it, in regard there were ma∣ny Horses in it, which the <HI>Portugueses</HI> principally wanted: and the more to encourage them, he promis'd to shew them such by-ways, that they might be able to surprize the Garri∣son; adding withal, That there would be no safe Passage for <HI>Claudius,</HI> so long as the Enemy held that Pass. <HI>Gomez</HI> understanding by the Queen that the <HI>Jew</HI> spake truth, un∣dertook the Enterprize with prosperous Success: for having slain all the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> he got a Booty there of Fourscore brave Horses, Three hundred Mules, several Slaves, and other good Plunder beside. After which he restor'd the Rock to the <HI>Jews,</HI> understanding they had always bin faithful to the <HI>Habessines.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean while <HI>Grainus</HI> finding there was no good to be done against the <HI>Portugals</HI> without Guns and Fire-Arms, sent for immediate Assistance from the Neighbouring <HI>Turks,</HI> and petty Basha's of <HI>Arabia.</HI> So that he obtain'd from the Bashaw of <HI>Zebid</HI> a fresh Supply of Seven hundred, some say, Nine hundred Musqueteers, and Ten Field-Pieces. Some noble <HI>Arabians</HI> also that were his Friends came to his assistance. <HI>Gomez,</HI> either knowing nothing of this, or else heighten'd by his two former Victories, never staying for <HI>Claudius,</HI> as he ought to have done; in regard he delayed somewhat longer than was expected, nor yet tarrying for some of the <HI>Portugals</HI> who brought Horses along with them: Or whether it were, that he was constrain'd to it, as having no place of Retreat, and did not believe that <HI>Grainus</HI> himself would appear before the Winter was over, gave the Enemy the opportunity of a Battel. But being over-powr'd by the <HI>Turks,</HI> he was wound∣ed with a Musquet Bullet in the Thigh. He himself, having lost many of his own Souldiers, and the stoutest of his Com∣manders, by the help of the Night escap'd to a Rock. The wounded and weary were all slain, the rest dispersed them∣selves into the Woods, while the Camp became a Prey to the Enemy. Fourteen only accompanied <HI>Gamez,</HI> the most of them wounded; who void of all assistance, without food or medicaments, refresh'd themselves by the Fountains
<PB N="225" REF="101"/>
which afforded but small relief. There they were appre∣hended by the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Arabians,</HI> and carried to <HI>Grainus</HI> ex∣ulting for joy of his Success. He causing about a hundred of the heads of the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> to be brought and laid down before him, upbraided <HI>Gomez</HI> for his madness in undertaking a War against him: and then after he had receiv'd a stern answer from his Captive, caus'd him to be tormented to death.</P>
<P>After that misfortune, the King came up, sad for the loss of <HI>Gomez,</HI> whom he desired most earnestly to have beheld with his Eyes. Nor were they less sad to whose assistance he came, as well for the loss they had receiv'd, as because he had brought so few Forces with him. Therefore they lay still three or four months, till they could raise more. They being come, the <HI>Portugals,</HI> who were now reduc'd to a hundred and twenty, and yet zealous to revenge the death of their Captain, were very urgent with the King to fight, giving him great hopes of Victory. For they had intelli∣gence that the <HI>Turks</HI> were return'd home, leaving only two hundred behind them: whether by Command of their <HI>Bas∣sha,</HI> or taking it ill that <HI>Gomez</HI> was not deliver'd to them. The King, though he had not above Eight thousand Foot, and Five hundred Horse, resolv'd to follow the Inclinations of the <HI>Portugals.</HI> And first in a slight skirmish he routed some of the <HI>Barbarian</HI> Forces that marched before; Then sets upon <HI>Grainus</HI> himself, who led an Army of 13000 men, and vanquish'd him; <HI>Grainus</HI> himself, the Terror of <HI>Habessi∣nia</HI> for so many years, was shot with a Musket Bullet by a <HI>Portugueze,</HI> who reveng'd the death of his Captain. All the <HI>Turks</HI> but fourteen were slain. The head of <HI>Grainus</HI> was exposed to the view of the People in several Provinces and Kingdoms of <HI>Habessinia,</HI> to the great comfort of the behold∣ers. For upon the sight of it, the <HI>Abissines</HI> recover'd Vigour and Courage; They congratulated their Kings Success; and they who had revolted, return'd to their duty, pretend∣ing necessity for the fault committed. The King consider∣ing the condition of those times, thought it convenient to par∣don all, to confirm the wavering, to win the hearts of his People by Clemency, to rally his scatter'd Forces, and to do all those things which were necessary for the re-establish∣ment of his Kingdom. Onely one of the principal Com∣manders,
<PB N="226" REF="102"/>
to whom the King had granted his pardon, the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> put to death as laying to his charge the Murder of <HI>Gomez.</HI> His perfidiousness was thought to have deserv'd death; and so justice prevail'd, without any further notice being taken of it. In the mean time, the <HI>Gallans,</HI> till then an obscure Nation, were neglected, tho they had invaded many Provinces already laid wast by the <HI>Adelans;</HI> not being look'd upon as such as would have encreas'd so much to the future dammage of the Kingdom. There was still a greater fear of the <HI>Adelans,</HI> who having in time repair'd their Losses, onely waited an Opportunity to make a New Invasion. Soon after their Spies returning with intelligence that the <HI>Habessines</HI> were grown secure, and consequently careless, under <HI>Nurus</HI> their Captain, they again broke into <HI>Habessinia</HI> with a migh∣ty Force; overthrew <HI>Claudius</HI> who advanc'd to oppose them, and slew him. After his Death, <HI>Menas</HI> obtain'd the Crown, hated by the People for his Cruelty. From thence Intestine Wars ensuing, the <HI>Turks</HI> being call'd into the Kingdom, over∣threw the King in Battel and slew him; which gave them an easie advantage to make themselves Masters of the Port of <HI>Arkiko,</HI> and the Iland of <HI>Matzua.</HI> His Son <HI>Zerza-Denghel,</HI> much more fortunate than his Father, perform'd many brave Atchievements, and beat the <HI>Turks</HI> of <HI>Tigra,</HI> but could not regain <HI>Arkiko,</HI> nor the Iland of <HI>Matzua.</HI> He raign'd Thirty Years continually vex'd with the <HI>Gallans,</HI> or harrass'd with Intestine Broyls. After his Death, Civil Dissensions, and deadly Strifes between the Royal Off-spring about the Crown, so weakn'd the <HI>Habessines,</HI> tormented at the same time with the <HI>Gallans,</HI> that from that time to this day, they could never Master that Potent Enemy. As to their Wars about Religion, that arose in the time of the Fathers of the Society, we shall speak more hereafter.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AT what time the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> making several Voyages into <HI>India,</HI> made War upon several Nations, their fame reach'd the <HI>Abessinians</HI> also; who glad that the Power of the <HI>Saracens</HI> was brought low, and that <HI>Egypt</HI> and their Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria</HI> was restor'd to freedom, were in hopes that the Passage to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> would be open. At the same time also was <HI>Peter Covillian</HI> among the <HI>Habessines,</HI> who had given them more certain Relations concerning the <HI>Portugue∣ses.</HI> Therefore <HI>Helena,</HI> the Grandmother of <HI>David,</HI> and Go∣verness of the Kingdom, as we have said, sent an Embassa∣dor into <HI>Portugal,</HI> one <HI>Matthew</HI> an <HI>Armenian,</HI> skilful in Foraign Affairs, and one that understood the Arabic Language, joyn∣ing with him a Young Nobleman of <HI>Habessinia.</HI> She was willing to employ a Forraigner, either because she could find none among her own People that were fit for such an Em∣ployment; or that she believ'd none of that Nation could get safely into <HI>Portugal,</HI> that Kingdom being hated by the Neighbouring Nations, by reason of the Pyracies of the <HI>Sa∣racens. Mattheus</HI> was certainly in danger, and sometimes de∣tain'd a Prisoner among the <HI>Arabians,</HI> out of whose hands he us'd many devices to escape; and at length got safe to <HI>God,</HI> to <HI>Albuquerquez,</HI> Vice-Roy of <HI>India,</HI> together with his Col∣league. By whom, tho he were nobly there entertain'd, yet he question'd the sending him into <HI>Portugal:</HI> Because such
<PB N="228" REF="103"/>
an Embassie seem'd no way Correspondent to the Dignity and Grandeur of the famous <HI>Presbyter John.</HI> And therefore he resolv'd first to expect the Kings Pleasure. Thereupon <HI>Matthew</HI> being detain'd Three Years in <HI>India,</HI> at length in the Year 1513. he arriv'd in <HI>Portugal.</HI> The<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">They are to be found after the Preface of <HI>Alvarez</HI>'s Itinerary, as also in the Treatise of <HI>Damianus</HI> a <HI>Goez,</HI> concerning the Great Emperour of the <HI>Indians,</HI> to <HI>Emanuel,</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> first printed at <HI>Dordrecht.</HI> But <HI>Tellezius</HI> forgot himself, when he writes, That <HI>Matthew</HI> brought <HI>David</HI>'s Epistle full of Titles: for that is to be attributed to <HI>Alvarez</HI> or <HI>Tragazaabus.</HI></NOTE> Letters which he brought from <HI>Helena,</HI> being written with the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> plain∣ness, without any bombast of gaudy Titles, seem'd to con∣tain more than they that sent them were able to perform. For they freely offer'd safe Conduct, and a Thousand other necessary Conveniences for Ships, which was look'd upon as a piece of boasting Vanity by the <HI>Portugals,</HI> who perhaps thought the Queen had spoken of the <HI>Indian</HI> Vessels of those Nations that lay upon the <HI>Red Sea. Matthew</HI> himself an ordi∣nary Merchant, without any Magnificence of Train, was hardly thought worthy so high an Employment; and they were afraid of future shame for having acknowledg'd a false Embassadour. After many and long delays, at length they were satisfy'd; and in return, another Embassie was decreed to the <HI>Habessines,</HI> and <HI>Odoardus Galvan</HI> was sent upon that Employment. He dying by the way, <HI>Rodorick Limez</HI> was sent in his room, whose Priest was <HI>Francis Alvarez,</HI> who left behind him an Itinerary, written in the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Language in a plain and ordinary style, tho afterwards, for Curiositie's sake, translated into several<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">By <HI>Michael de Selves,</HI> into <HI>Spanish;</HI> by others into <HI>Italian</HI> and <HI>Dutch: Jovius</HI> promis'd also to do it into <HI>Latin,</HI> but fail'd.</NOTE> Languages.</P>
<P>Six Years <HI>Rodoric Limez</HI> resided in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> before he was dismiss'd by the King, that he might be in a Capacity to make the same return of Kindness to the <HI>Portugals.</HI> At length he sent him back, joyning with him <HI>Tzagazaabus,</HI> with Let∣ters to the Pope and the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> flourish'd at the beginning, with those usual Titles, which we have already recited. But what is to be admir'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Tzagazaabus</HI> arriv'd not at <HI>Rome,</HI> till the Year 1539, being detain'd at <HI>Lisbon.</HI> Certain other<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Extant in <HI>Alvarez.

who carry'd them to <HI>Bononia,</HI> and made a long Discourse of the Respect and Reverence which the Kings of <HI>Habessinia</HI> had to the See of <HI>Rome.</HI> They were read before <HI>Clement</HI> the Seventh, and the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the First, with the general Applause of the Court of <HI>Rome;</HI> but with no Success. For that <HI>Claudius</HI> the King plainly deny'd to ratifie either those things, or what <HI>John Bermudes</HI> afterwards related at <HI>Rome</HI> to the same effect; as if never given in Command, nor so under∣stood, but that the business of the Embassie, and consequent∣ly the Letters themselves had bin faign'd and contriv'd by the <HI>Portugals.</HI> However, the <HI>Habessinians</HI> being reduc'd to very great streights, at the Intercession of <HI>Bermudes,</HI> had an assistance of Four hunder'd and fifty men granted, and sent into <HI>Habessinia</HI> by the Command of <HI>John</HI> the Third. But <HI>Peter Pays</HI> positively writes, That this was done at the request of the Queen of <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> And that <HI>Stephen Gomez</HI> who sail'd into the <HI>Red Sea</HI> to burn the <HI>Turkish</HI> Ships, and by chance came to an Anchor before the Iland of <HI>Matzua,</HI> after he had consulted his Councel of Warr, resolv'd to send the said Sup∣ply, as seeming to be for the honour of God and the King. Of which Consultation there had certainly bin no need, if the King had Commanded the Supply before. However it were, that Succour was not onely very necessary, but very advantageous to the <HI>Habessines.</HI> From which time the <HI>Ha∣bessines</HI> were not onely gratefully, but honourably receiv'd among the <HI>Habessines:</HI> nor did they then refuse the <HI>Latin</HI> Religion, but frequently went to the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Chappels, and admitted Them into Theirs. Moreover, they also gave Liberty to the <HI>Habessinian</HI> Women that were marry'd to the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> to go to Mass with their Husbands, and to par∣take of the same Ceremonies with them. So that during the Raign of <HI>Claudius,</HI> there was great Hopes both at <HI>Rome</HI> and at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> that the <HI>Habessinians</HI> might be perswaded to embrace the <HI>Romish</HI> Religion. But that Hope proving vain, there was for some time a Cessation of Embassies, and the <HI>Abessi∣nian</HI> Friendship with the <HI>Lusitanians</HI> was almost interrupted; untill by the Artifices of the Fathers of the Society, the Minds of the later Kings were somewhat more inclinably dispos'd to give Obedience to the See of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>Upon that, Letters were written to the Pope and the King
<PB N="230" REF="104"/>
of <HI>Spain,</HI> who was then also King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and answers upon them, which gave an Occasion to <HI>Susneus</HI> to decree an Embassie into <HI>Europe.</HI> To that purpose<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Mistakenly <HI>Tecur-Egzy</HI> in <HI>Tellezius,</HI> l. 2. c. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Fecur-Egzie</HI> was chosen, and with him <HI>Antonie Fernandez</HI> was joyn'd; who were commanded by unknown and by-ways to Travel <HI>Southward,</HI> till they reach'd <HI>Melinda,</HI> upon the Shore of the <HI>Indian Ocean,</HI> from whence the Passage was more Easie and Safe into <HI>India.</HI> Thereupon setting forth out of <HI>Gojam,</HI> they Travell'd through <HI>Enarea,</HI> from thence into the Kingdom of <HI>Zendero,</HI> and so to <HI>Cambata,</HI> the Last Kingdom under the <HI>Habessine</HI> Dominions. Thence Travelling into <HI>Alaba,</HI> they were forbid to go any farther, by the Governour of the Pro∣vince, who was a <HI>Mahumetan.</HI> He apprehended the Embas∣sador with his Train; and had not the Law of Nations bin of some force among the <HI>Barbarians</HI> (for they had about them to shew both their Letters and Presents from the Emperour) they had bin put to death, with the Law in their own hands. Being by that means set at Liberty, after a Years and seven Months time spent in hard Travel, after many sad Experien∣ces of Savage Barbarity and a Thousand Jeopardies, they return'd home without effecting any thing. Nor can any reason be certainly given, why those unknown and dange∣rous Ways were chosen, thorough so many Barbarous Na∣tions, so many Wild and Desert Countries, when the Road lay so plain through the Kingdom of <HI>Denoale</HI> in Friendship with the <HI>Abissines,</HI> to the Port of <HI>Baylur,</HI> which the Patriarch of <HI>Portugal</HI> afterwards securely made use of: as if so tedious a Journey had bin impos'd upon the Undertakers, not so much to go upon an Embassie, as for the Discovery of For∣raign Countries, and By-Roads, for the Direction of Travel∣lers.</P>
<P>After that, there happening a difference between them and the See of <HI>Rome,</HI> all manner of Commerce and Communi∣cation with the <HI>Europeans</HI> ceas'd: Insomuch, that now they would with great reluctancy admit those whom before they so highly admir'd, and with great difficulty would dismiss, out of their affection to Arts and Sciences; especially, if they suspected them to be Clergy-men, or under Religious Vows.
<PB N="231" REF="104"/>
For which reason they try'd them first, by offering a Wife to every Stranger.</P>
<P>Otherwise, they rarely send any Embassadors abroad, un∣less it be into <HI>Egypt,</HI> when they have need of the Metropoli∣tan. For they are not onely ignorant of forraign Affairs and Languages, but of the Ways and Roads of other Countries. By reason of their Vicinity to the <HI>Turks,</HI> and thence their fre∣quent Commerce one with another, sometimes they are forc'd to send Embassadors to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> as in the Year 1660. So in the Year 1661, one <HI>Michael</HI> was sent thither with the wonted Presents; a living <HI>Tecora;</HI> several Skins of dead ones; Pigmies and the like, as <HI>Thevenot</HI> writes. In the Year 1671, another Embassador was sent, with some of those painted Beasts, and Letters to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Governour of <HI>Bata∣via.</HI> But they who are sent, are generally Forrainers, <HI>Maro∣nites, Armenians,</HI> or else <HI>Arabians.</HI> But as for what <HI>Leonardus Rauchwolf</HI> writes in his Itinerary, it is altogether vain and false: That <HI>Presbyter John</HI> having made a League with the <HI>Persians,</HI> sent a <HI>Persian</HI> Bishop with so many Priests, that in Two years time they converted Twenty Christian Cities to the Christian Religion. It seems to be an old and confus'd Relation, and to be understood of that same ancient <HI>Asiatic Prester Chan,</HI> Neighbouring at that time upon the <HI>Persians.</HI> But he ascribes this passage to the Emperour of the <HI>Abessines,</HI> and that it came to pass Twelve years before his coming. <HI>Philip Nicolai</HI> believ'd him, and inserted this Figment into his Book concerning the Raign of Christ, adding the Year 1562, at what time the Affairs of the <HI>Habessines</HI> were in their most afflicted Estate.</P>

<P>The Governor of <HI>Diabai</HI> is call'd <HI>Ded-Asmat,</HI> which is pro∣perly the common Title of all Presidents, and signifies the Captain of a Provincial Militia, or a Colonel. This diver∣sity of Titles seems to arise from hence, for that the ancient Possessors of these Kingdoms, before they came to be reduc'd under the Power of the <HI>Habessines,</HI> assum'd those Titles of Dignity to themselves, which afterwards the Vulgar People gave to their several Governors in their distinct Idiomes. Or else the Governors themselves retain'd the ancient names; the Kings of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> conniving at it, as esteeming it for their Honour to have so many Persons of several Dignities at their devotion. For because the Governors and Vice-Roys of Provinces assum'd to themselves the Titles of <HI>Negus,</HI> and <HI>Na∣gasi,</HI> therefore the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Kings took an occasion to give themselves the Title of <HI>Negusa Nagast,</HI> or <HI>King of Kings.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVIII.</HI> Of the Princes that are Tributary to the Kings of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> and of others subject to him, that claim absolute Dominion in their own Territories.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Tributary Princes never Forty, much less Sixty; <HI>Gregory</HI> acknowledg'd but Four: appointed by the King for a time. That Dignity heredita∣tary to some few. The next equally Subject. The reason. All call'd Ser∣vants, even the Queen herself which seem'd very severe to the <HI>Portugals.</HI> The same Custom among the <HI>Rasses.</HI> The Kings Pavilion sacred.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THat the Kings of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> formerly had several Tribu∣tary Kings under them, we have already declar'd.<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">This <HI>Dam. de Goez.</HI> relates of him, in his Book, concerning the State and Kingdom of <HI>Presbyter John,</HI> 11.11.</NOTE> <HI>Matthew</HI> the <HI>Armenian</HI> reckn'd them up, tho untruly, to the number of Fifty, tho most erroneously. Nor did they write with more Truth, who tell us of Fifty or Forty; when as they have not so many <HI>Vice-Roys. Gregory</HI> knew but Four, that is so say, the Kings of <HI>Sennar, Dancala, Garaga,</HI> and <HI>Ena∣rea.</HI> As for the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Sennar,</HI> he has often revolted and made Warr upon the <HI>Abessines.</HI> The <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Dencala</HI> is a firm Allie, but oblig'd to no sort of Tribute. All the rest, whe∣ther <HI>Kings</HI> or Governors, are by the <HI>King</HI> himself appointed to govern such and such <HI>Kingdoms</HI> and <HI>Provinces,</HI> and are only <HI>pro tempore.</HI> Some few there are, that claim a supreme Dig∣nity by right of Inheritance. But all of Royal descent; and all other of the Nobility, who are reputed to derive their Pedigrees from the <HI>Israelitish</HI> Race, are equally subject to the <HI>King;</HI> without any distinction of Dukes, Earls, Marquesses and Barons, as<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI> n. 13.

For the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> as most of the Eastern <HI>Kings,</HI> deem it not a

decent thing to command Illustrious Families. Not belie∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng that Servitude can be expected from those that are ac∣custom'd to Command themselves. Moreover, they pre∣sume that Hereditary Dignity is an obstruction to Vertue; that Men are more certainly made, than born great; and that they will prove more faithful, whom they have rais'd from the Dust, then such as claim their Fortunes from their Ancestors. Therefore the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> accompt them∣selves onely Lords; all others they look upon as Servants: in that particular not sparing their Brothers or their Kindred. So that when they bestow any Government upon them, they use this form, <HI>We have created our Servant such a one Go∣vernour of this, or that Province.</HI> Nor do they ever discourse them but in the singular number, <HI>Thou:</HI> whereas we gene∣rally make use in our Language of the second person plural. No other Epithite do they afford their own Queens, tho of the highest Rank of Nobility. <HI>We have caus'd to Raign,</HI> that is, <HI>We have taken to Wife our Servant such a one.</HI> Nor do they disdain these Titles: but on the contrary call themselves reciprocally <HI>his Servants.</HI> This word <HI>Servant,</HI> was very ill digested by a generous <HI>Portuguese,</HI> as looking upon the title of <HI>Slave,</HI> to be a disgrace to him that was a <HI>Freeman.</HI> And therefore he offer'd a good Summ of Money to him, that, according to Custome, was to proclaim the Government con∣ferr'd upon him, to leave out the word <HI>Servant,</HI> and onely to proclaim his bare name; but could not obtain it. Nor is the <HI>Negus</HI> of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> to be tax'd for this alone, seeing all the Princes of <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI> use the same Custom. The same So∣vereignty is claim'd and maintain'd by the <HI>Russian</HI> Emperour; whose Grandees never call themselves any other then <HI>Golop,</HI> his <HI>Servants;</HI> nor in their Letters which they write to him do they subscribe their names any otherwise than in the<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">As for Example; <HI>Hansellus, Stephanuel, Laurentioll,</HI> thy Servant. <HI>Olear.</HI> his Itinerary.</NOTE> <HI>Di∣minutive.</HI> We are also to understand, That the word <HI>Gabre,</HI> or <HI>Servant,</HI> has a more diffusive signification among Them than among Us. For it extends not to real Slaves alone, but their Subjects and Domesticks. And indeed, to say truth, they differ but little from Slaves, who are bound to observe their

<HI>King</HI> at all times with Body, having nothing at all of Pro∣perty, to which they can lay the least claim. Nor are the Ceremonies less servile by which they testifie their Submis∣sion and Reverence to their <HI>King.</HI> The <HI>Bah-tu-ded</HI> himself the Chief of his Ministers, as <HI>Alvarez</HI> relates it, stood before the <HI>King</HI>'s Pavillion, naked up to his Thighs, with his Head and his right hand almost touching the Earth, and a poor Linnen swath-band about his forehead, crying out thrice, <HI>Abeto,</HI> or <HI>most merciful Lord.</HI> Being ask'd according to Cu∣stome, <HI>Who he was?</HI> he answer'd, <HI>He was the meanest of the Court, that Saddl'd the Kings Carriage Horses, ready prepar'd to obey all Commands.</HI> When the Kings Messenger, whom they call <HI>Kol Hatzè,</HI> the King's Voice, declares the <HI>King</HI>'s Com∣mands afoot, it behoves all that hear to be afoot. Neither is it lawful to ride up to the <HI>King</HI>'s Pavillion, no more than if it were to some Altar, but the person must always alight at a distance.</P>
<P>Suppliants having occasion to make their Petitions to the <HI>King,</HI> stand in a certain place, and instead of Petitions which they know not how to write, betimes in the Morning with loud Voices and different Tones, whereby they may be se∣verally distinguish'd by their Countries, they wake the sleeping King, beseeching him to hear their complaints.

<P>These particular Tones of Suppliants are taken norice of; and as soon as day appears, such and such are commanded to be admitted, and heard: or if it be a business of moment, the King himself gives them audience and returns them their answer. And surely it is the chief Office of Kings to hear the Complaints of their Suppliants, and to administer timely Justice to their Subjects. Of which the <HI>Barbarian</HI> Kings not being unmindful, gave opportunity to poor and miserable people, to whom their Court was shut up from access, to convey their Complaints to the Kings Ears.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIX.</HI> Of their Judiciary Proceedings and Punishments.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Their Judicial Proceedings very plain. Witnesses slightly and cursorily exa∣min'd. Appeals rare. Their Punishments, Stoning, Drubbing, and Ba∣nishment. Homicides how punished. A Discourse of Like for Like.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe manner of their Judicial Proceedings is very plain and ordinary. For all Controversies are determin'd by word of Mouth, without any noise of Process, without any Writs, or Writings, of which the most part of the Nation is ignorant. The Plaintiff has liberty to produce his Witnes∣ses, which the Defendant may refuse, if he have any reason to suspect them But in regard of their ignorance of the true Proceedings by way of Interrogatory and proof, nor under∣stand how to examin a Witness, it must of necessity follow, That Justice is but ill administer'd, where the Witnesses are so cursorily heard. It is lawful to appeal from Inferiour Sentences either to the King or the Court-Tribunals: but that is seldom done; by reason of the Poverty of the People, and the tediousness of Travelling: and partly out of the Little hopes they have of redress. For the Governours and Judges of Provinces are offended with appeals, as seeming to them an accusation of Injustice; and therefore the wrong'd Parties fearing their displeasure, rather choose to lose their right, than the favour of the Judges. Neither does the re∣signing of Office afford any relief against an unjust Sentence. For either through Favour or for Money they obtain a Par∣don for all things done amiss in their Magistracy.</P>
<P>Among the sorts of Punishments inflicted upon Offenders, besides <HI>Beheading</HI> and <HI>Hanging,</HI> the most ready at hand is <HI>Stoning</HI> to death: the Soyl affording sufficient materials for that sort of Execution. The next is <HI>Drubbing,</HI> if the Crime be not Capital.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="108"/>The punishment of the Nobility, is Exilement into the <HI>Zanic</HI> Lake, or into their high and steep Rocks, which are in a manner like Ilands; from whence however they frequent∣ly escape by reason that the People are easily corrupted by Bribery.</P>
<P>Homicides are deliver'd up to the next of<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">A Custome still us'd in <HI>Persia,</HI> as you may read in <HI>Tavernier</HI> and <HI>Olearius.</HI></NOTE> Kin to the Party murder'd, at whose free will it is, to pardon the Male∣factors, sell them to forraign Merchants, or put them to what death they please. If the Homicide escape unknown, the Inhabitants of the place and all the Neighbourhood are ob∣lig'd to pay a Fine; by which means many Murthers are ei∣ther prevented or discover'd.</P>
<P>Most certainly the Law of <HI>Like for Like,</HI> was always and still is accompted the most just, and plainest among several Nations. Hence that of <HI>Moses, An Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth.</HI> But because there is not the same use of all mem∣bers among men, some men according to their various Cal∣lings having more use of one Member than another; some being better able to lose their Hands than their Leggs: others the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Leggs than their Hands: therefore among the Civiliz'd Nations this Law grew out of custome. And it seems unjust to surrender the Offender to the Malice and Fury of the Offended Party, when they may have unbyass'd Jud∣ges, to give Sentence without Favour or Affection.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the ancient Religion of the <HI>Abissines,</HI> and their Judaic Rites.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Ecclesiastical History of the <HI>Abissines</HI> corrupt: and why. The first Relation of <HI>Matthew</HI> the <HI>Armenian</HI> false; <HI>Tzagazaabus</HI>'s Confession as little to be credited. Those of the Fathers, and <HI>Tellezius</HI> more certain.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>NOw we proceed to the Ecclesiastical History of the <HI>Habessinians,</HI> then which there is not any other more corrupt. For whatever we find scatter'd in our Re∣lations, were neither collected out of the Books which are publickly authentic in <HI>Habessinia,</HI> nor taken from the report of any persons there skill'd in the Ecclesiastical Affairs of that Country, but partly ill related through the Rashness of the Writers themselves; partly by the same persons or others ill understood through their ignorance of the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Lan∣guage.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="109"/>The first Relation concerning the Religion of the <HI>Habes∣sines,</HI> was set forth by <HI>Damianus</HI> a <HI>Goez,</HI> a noble <HI>Lusitanian,</HI> from the Report of <HI>Matthew</HI> the <HI>Armenian,</HI> First <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Em∣bassador to <HI>Emanuel</HI> King of <HI>Portugal;</HI> which Narrative of his<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>In a little Treatise often quoted,</HI> Of the Embassie of the Great Emperor of the <HI>Indians.</HI></NOTE> contains many things ambiguous, many other things alto∣gether false. Insomuch that <HI>Tzagazaabus,</HI> the second <HI>Habes∣sinian</HI> Embassador, plainly tax'd the Author of it,<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>For thus he sayes in his Confession of Faith,</HI> Matthew, in regard he was an <HI>Armenian,</HI> could not so perspicuously understand our affairs, especially those that rela∣ted to our Faith. And therefore he reported many things to King <HI>Emanuel,</HI> which are not in use among Ʋs. Which he did not out of desire to tell an untruth, because he was a good man, but because he knew little concerning our Religion. <HI>But in my opinion, that good man</HI> Matthew <HI>spake many things, which he knew much better.</HI></NOTE> for his ignorance. Tho he himself in the Confession of his Faith, which the same<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Extant in the 2. Tom. of <HI>Spain</HI> illustrated, p. 1302.</NOTE> <HI>Goez</HI> set forth, did not much excel him either for truth or probability, for which reason <HI>Tellezius</HI> not undeservedly reprehends him. Certainly <HI>Gregory</HI> was very much offended with him; And when he heard his following Doctrines,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That Jesus Christ was the Son of the Father, and the beginning of himself: in the same manner that the Holy Ghost, was the Spirit of himself, and proceeded from the Father and the Son.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That he descended into Hell where was the Soul of</HI> Adam, <HI>and Christ himself, which Soul of</HI> Adam <HI>Christ received from the Virgin</HI> Mary: and toward the latter end of the Book, <HI>That Christ de∣scended into Hell for the Soul of</HI> Adam <HI>and not for his own.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That the Souls of men piously deceas'd are not crucify'd in Pur∣gatory upon the Sabaoth and Lords Day.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That by the Decree and Commandment of Queen</HI> Maqueda <HI>the Women were also to be Circumcis'd, as having a certain glandulous piece of Flesh, not unfit to receive the Impression and mark of Circum∣cision.</HI></P>
<P>I say, when <HI>Tellezius</HI> heard these things, and many other of the same mixture, in no small heat and Passion, he cry'd out, <HI>That they were Fictions, Dreams, nay meer Lyes:</HI> frequently repeating these words; <HI>If he said this, he was a Beast of the Field.</HI></P>
<P>Yet out of these Books most of those Stories have flow'd, which our Writers have made public, concerning the Reli∣gion
<PB N="240" REF="110"/>
of the <HI>Abessines.</HI> But the Fathers of the Society, having bin conversant so long in <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> and view'd the <HI>Habessine</HI> Books, after several Disputations and Discourses with them, have bin able to afford us more Truth, whose Acts and Wri∣tings being free for the perusal of <HI>Tellezius,</HI> we shall cull the choicest of his accurate Relations, and what he has reported more ambiguous or more partially, out of his dislike of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Religion, we shall correct out of their own Wri∣tings, or from the Discourses of <HI>Gregory</HI> himself.</P>
<P>Certainly to Christians, no History can be more pleasant than that of Ecclesiastical affairs; especially if we look back to the Primitive Church. For whom would it not ravish into a high admiration of the wonderful Providence of God as well in founding as preserving his Church? when he shall consider that it grew up, and increas'd, not by the Propaga∣tion of Arms or human Arts, but by the Oppression of Hea∣thenish persecution. To whom can it be unpleasing to con∣sider with a Pious Contemplation, the undaunted Courage of the Martyrs, the Constancy of her Doctors, the Sincerity of the Christian People, the Purity of the Faith, the Strife of Good Works, the Patience of the Weak, the plainness of the Rites and Ceremonies? Which when they once began to be alter'd, with the reverence to the Church be it spoken, then also enter'd in Pride instead of Modesty, Ambition instead of Charity, together with Faction and Contention. As if our leisure and our Quiet were therefore granted us by Heaven to consume that time in making Scrutinies into all the miste∣ries of Faith, and moving such impertinent Questions, which ought to be spent in exercises of Charity and Piety.</P>
<P>But I return to the Religion of the <HI>Habessines,</HI> concerning the Original of which, there are various Opinions of sundry Authors. They that admit the Tradition of the <HI>Habessines</HI> concerning Queen <HI>Maqueda,</HI> are of Opinion, that the <HI>Abes∣sines</HI> had the true knowledge of God, ever since the Raign of King <HI>Salomon,</HI> and that their Judaic Rites, such as <HI>Circumci∣sion, abstaining from meats forbidden, Observation of the Sabboth, Marriage of the Brothers Wife, and the like,</HI> had their Original from thence. But in regard these things were commonly practis'd as well in other Nations, as among the Primitive Nations, who conform'd to the <HI>Jews</HI> in several things, It is not a thing to be easily affirm'd, that these were the foot∣steps of those Ceremonies receiv'd so many Ages before from
<PB N="241" REF="110"/>
the <HI>Jews.</HI> For not onely the <HI>Jews,</HI> but several other Na∣tions made use of Circumcision, and still so do to this day, tho not out of any knowledge of its Original, or any Conside∣ration of Divine Worship. The most<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Herodot. in <HI>Thalia.</HI></NOTE> ancient Histo∣rians tells us, That the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> were the first that institu∣ted that Ceremony, or else learnt it from the <HI>Ethiopians.</HI> From thence it came to be in use among the <HI>Colchi, Phoenicians,</HI> and <HI>Syrians.</HI> They of <HI>Alnajah,</HI> an <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Nation, circumcise with sharp Stones. And <HI>Ephinanius</HI> expresly mentions the <HI>Ho∣merites,</HI> from whence the <HI>Habessinians</HI> are descended, for the same Custome. We omit the <HI>Troglodytes, Nigrytes,</HI> and other in∣numerable Nations, which either do not understand the cause of it, use it for<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> for cleanliness sake. <HI>idem.</HI></NOTE> cleanliness; or else pretend it to be conducible<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philo Judaeus</HI> in his peculiar Chapter of Circumcision, brings these and many more reasons.</NOTE> to generation; or that they have a longer <HI>Preputium,</HI> and therefore thought it convenient to have it cut away, as<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">In his Oriental Itinerary. <HI>c.</HI> 32. <HI>p.</HI> 1.</NOTE> <HI>Thevenot</HI> writes: for fear those more pure <HI>Musulmen,</HI> should be polluted with their own Urine.</P>
<P>Neither did <HI>Mahomet</HI> recommend it to his <HI>Arabians,</HI> as learnt from the <HI>Jews;</HI> but left the Custom as he found it; nor does he make any mention of it in all his Alcoran. Besides, there is a great difference between the Circumcision of the <HI>Jews</HI> and that of other Nations. For other Nations onely round the Skin with the Knife, but the <HI>Jews</HI> slit the Skin with their nailes, till the <HI>Prepution</HI> falls down, and leaves the <HI>Nut</HI> altogether bare; for unless there be <HI>Perignah denudation,</HI> they do not think the Circumcision accomplish'd. For so their Doctors teach, <HI>Who circumcises and does not lay bare, is as one that never circumcis'd.</HI> So that if the Skin should happen to grow together again, it must be again dissected. Whence it is easier to understand what is meant by those Places in Scrip∣ture which mention the<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">If any one be Circumcised, let him not draw over, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> drawing over of his <HI>Preputium.</HI> For being cut off, it can never be restored by any Art, but being onely slit or torn, it may be sowed together again. Whence
<PB N="242" REF="111"/>
it is easie to find that the <HI>Habessines</HI> do not use the same manner of Circumcising with the <HI>Jews.</HI> Neither is it per∣formed with any signal Ceremony or Commmemoration. For it is done privately by some poor woman or other, with∣out any Standers by, not so much as the Father himself. But the Confession of <HI>Claudius</HI> King of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> takes away all doubt, who to clear himself and his people from all Suspition of Judaisme, says thus.</P>
<P><HI>But as to the Custome of Circumcision, we do not Circumcise like the</HI> Jews, <HI>For we understand the words of St.</HI> Paul, <HI>the Fountain of Wisdome, who saith,</HI> It profits not to be Circumcis'd, <HI>nor doth Circumcision avail: but rather the new Creation, which is Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. And then to the</HI> Corinthians <HI>he sayes, again, who hath taken upon him Circumcision,</HI><NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">The Printed Copy varies from this, where the words are more obscure. <HI>If any one goes in uncircumcised, let him not go forth.</HI></NOTE> <HI>let him not keep his Preputium. All the Books of St.</HI> Pauls <HI>learning are among us, and tell us of Circumcision and the Preputium; but our Cir∣cumcision is done according to the custom of the Countrey, like incisions of the Face in</HI> Ethiopia <HI>and</HI> Nubia, <HI>and boaring the Ears among the</HI> Indians.</P>
<P>This puts us in mind of the Circumcision of Females, of which <HI>Gregory</HI> was somewhat asham'd to discourse, and we should have more willingly omitted it, had not <HI>Tzaga∣zaabus</HI> in his rude Confession of Faith, spoken of it as of a most remarkable Custom introduced by the command of Queen <HI>Maqueda;</HI> or had not <HI>Paulus Jovius</HI> himself, Bishop of <HI>Como,</HI> insisted in the same manner upon this unseemly Custome. This same Ceremony was not onely us'd by the <HI>Habissines,</HI> but also familiar among other people of <HI>Africa</HI> the <HI>(k) Aegyptians,</HI> and the <HI>Arabians</HI> themselves. For they cut away from the Female Infants something which they think to be an Indecency and Superfluity of Nature. The most impudent women that inhabit about the <HI>Cape of good Hope,</HI> still retain this Custome, and for a small mat∣ter, expose themselves to the Sea-men. <HI>Jovius</HI> calls it, <HI>Ca∣runniculam,</HI> or a little <HI>piece of Flesh. Golius,</HI> an oblong Excres∣cence. The <HI>Arabians</HI> by a particular word called it <HI>Bedhron</HI> or <HI>Bedhara,</HI> beside which they have many other words to
<PB N="243" REF="111"/>
the same purpose. Among their Women it is as great a piece of reproach, to revile a woman by saying to her, <HI>O Bandaron:</HI> that is, <HI>O uncircumcis'd,</HI> as to call a man <HI>Arel,</HI> or <HI>uncircumcis'd</HI> among the <HI>Jews.</HI> A strange thing, that onely in <HI>Africa</HI> and some Parts of <HI>Asia,</HI> the Women should be noted for those ex∣tuberancies: for the Jewish women in <HI>Germany,</HI> being ac∣quainted by their reading with this Custome, laugh at it, as admiring what it should be that should require such an am∣putation.</P>
<P>Nevertheless this seems to have some reference to the for∣bidden use of Swines Flesh, and other Meats not allow'd by the Mosaic Law, as the same King <HI>Claudius</HI> manifestly gives us to understand in his Confession.</P>
<P><HI>But as to what relates to the Eating of Swines Flesh, we are not for∣bid it, out of regard to the observance of the Mosaic Law, as the</HI> Jews <HI>were. For we do not abhor him that feeds upon it; nor do we force him that does not, to make it his diet, as our Father</HI> Paul <HI>writing to the</HI> Romans <HI>hath written. Who eats, let him not contemn him that eateth not, for the Lord accepts all. The Kingdom of Heaven con∣sists not in meat or drink. But it is not good for a man to eat to the scandal of another: And</HI> Matthew <HI>the Evangelist sayes, Nothing can defile a man but that which goeth out of his mouth. For what ever goeth into the belly, and is retain'd in the stomach, that at length is cast into the Draught. And thus he pronounces all meat clean. Now while he spoke those words he destroy'd the whole structure of the</HI> Jews <HI>Error, who were learned in the Books of the Mosaic Law.</HI></P>
<P>Most Nations have a particular Dyet, some by custome, some through superstition.</P>
<P>Not to speak of the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> who abstain not only from Swines flesh, but from Wine, is not the custom of the <HI>Ban∣nians,</HI> not much different from the ancient <HI>Pythagoreans,</HI> to be strangely admir'd? who onely feed upon Herbs and Meats made of Milk, which we hardly believe sufficient to sustain Nature. Others there are that devour all sorts of Creatures which the flesh consuming Beasts themselves refuse, and other∣wise nauseous to the most part of Men. The Oriental <HI>Tar∣tars</HI> feed upon Camels, Foxes and all sorts of wild Beasts. Some of our <HI>Europeans</HI> indulging their appetites, please their palats with a sort of Dyet abominated by all other People, as Frogs, Cockles, and I know not what sort of Insects. <HI>Gregory</HI> had
<PB N="244" REF="112"/>
an utter aversion to Lobsters, Crabbs, Crayfish and Oysters, which we accompt our chiefest Delicacies: and it turn'd his stomach to see Turkies, Hares, and several other Dishes to which he was unaccustom'd, brought to our Tables. Being ask'd, why he abstain'd from Swines flesh? he retorted still, and <HI>why we from Horse-flesh?</HI> And most certainly were we to banquet with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> there are but very few of us that would easily be induc'd to eat Horse-flesh with an Appetite, tho it be one of their principal junkets. Nay their Embassa∣dors to our Princes desire fat Horses for their Kitchins.</P>
<P>However they abstain from blood and things strangl'd, not out of any observance of the <HI>Mosaic</HI> Law, but an Apostolic Decree always in force in the Eastern Church: which was also for many Ages observ'd in the Western Church, and re∣viv'd in some Councils. They also rebuke us, for that we suffer'd that Decree to be laid aside.</P>
<P>Nor do they allow the <HI>Jews</HI> Sabboth out of a respect to Judaism, or that they learnt it from some certain Nations that kept the Seventh day holy. But because the ancient Custom of the Primitive Church, who observ'd that day per∣haps out of complacency to the <HI>Jews,</HI> being long retain'd in the East, was at length carry'd into <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> For thus we find it written in some <HI>ancient Constitutions</HI> which they call the Constitutions of the Apostles.</P>
<P><HI>Let the Servants labour five days, but let them keep the Holydays, the Sabboth, and the Lords Day in the Church for the sake of Pious Instruction.</HI></P>
<P>The Council of <HI>Laodicea</HI> decreed that the Gospels with other parts of Scripture should be read upon the Sabboth; when before the Paragraphs of the Law of <HI>Moses</HI> were onely read upon the Sabboth, and the <HI>Gospels</HI> upon the Sunday: the Texts of the old Law being thought most agreeable to the Old Sabboth, and the Texts of the New Testament, to the New Sabboth.</P>
<P><HI>Socrates</HI> also farther testifies that the People us'd to assemble at Church upon the Sabboth and Lords Day.</P>
<P>And <HI>Gregory Nyssen,</HI> whose Writings the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> have among them, saith,</P>
<P><HI>With what Eyes dost thou behold the Lords Day, who hast defil'd
<PB N="247" REF="112"/>
the Sabboth? Know'st thou not that these two days are Twins, and that if thou injur'st the one, thou dost injury to the other?</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Claudius</HI> makes so much difference between both days, that he prefers the Lords day before the Sabaoth.</P>
<P><HI>But as to what pertains to our Celebration of the ancient Sabaoth, we do not celebrate it, as the Jews did, who Crucify'd Christ, saying,</HI> Let his blood be upon Us and our Children. <HI>For those Jews neither draw water, nor kindle fires, nor dress meat, nor bake bread; neither do they go from house to house. But we so celebrate it, that we administer the Sacrament, and relieve the Poor and the Widow, as our Fathers the Apostles commanded Us. We Celebrate it as the Sa∣baoth of the first Holiday, which is a new day of which</HI> David <HI>saith,</HI> This is the day which the Lord made, let us rejoyce and ex∣ult therein. <HI>For upon that day our Lord Jesus Christ rose: and upon that day the Holy Ghost descended upon the Apostles in the Ora∣tory of Sion. And in that day Christ was incarnated in the Womb of the Perpetual Virgin St.</HI> Mary: <HI>and upon that day he shall come again to reward the Just, and punish the Evil.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gregory</HI> also testify'd, That the <HI>Habessines</HI> abstain from no sort of Labour upon the Sabaoth, but from the most servile sorts of Labour. This Custom continu'd long in the Church, till it was abrogated by degrees; for by the 22<SUP>d</SUP> <HI>Canon</HI> of the said <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Laodicea</HI> the Christians are forbid to work upon the Sabaoth. Nevertheless the Sacred Lectures were con∣tinu'd for a time, as appears by the Canon above mention'd, till at length those were also left off; perhaps because that the People having a licence to work, there were but few that repair'd to Church.</P>
<P>Moreover, according to the Custom of the <HI>Jews,</HI> it is law∣ful in <HI>Abessinia</HI> to marry the Widow of the Brother deceas'd, as <HI>Alvarez</HI> testifies. Adding, That the <HI>Habessinian</HI> defend their so doing by the Laws of the Old Testament. But <HI>Gregory</HI> positively deny'd that it was lawful, but onely con∣niv'd at by the Magistrate. However, that such Wives are also prohibited from coming to the Holy Communion, wherein <HI>Alvarez</HI> agrees with him. However it does not therefore follow, that this Custom was translated from the <HI>Jews</HI> to the <HI>Habessines,</HI> no more then if any one should assert
<PB N="248" REF="113"/>
that the Laws of Polygamie and Divorce were deriv'd from the <HI>Jews.</HI> And yet this is somewhat strange, I must confess, that they abstain from that Muscle, which the <HI>Hebrews</HI> call <HI>Ghid Hannesheh,</HI> or the <HI>Sinew</HI> mutilated: the <HI>Ethiopians, Sereje Berum, the forbidden Nerve:</HI> the <HI>Amharies, Shalada.</HI> Which very probably they might learn from the <HI>Jews</HI> in their own Country, of which Nation there are several Colonies in <HI>Ethiopia.</HI></P>
<P>But as to what is reported concerning Queen <HI>Candaces</HI> Eu∣nuch, we have already shew'd that she was not Queen of <HI>Habessinia,</HI> but of the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> that inhabited the Iland of <HI>Meroe:</HI> and if the Eunuch were a <HI>Jew,</HI> it does not follow that his Lady the Queen shall be so too. Others there are who tell us. That <HI>Menilehec</HI>'s Successors in a short time return'd to the worship of Idols. Which if it be true, the assertion of the Continuation of the Jewish Religion till the time of the Apostles, will prove altogether vain: tho in <HI>Europe</HI> most certainly the <HI>Habessines</HI> were long suspected of Judaisme, and so are many to this day. Which King <HI>Claudius</HI> observing by his Disputations with <HI>Gonsalo Rodriguez,</HI> and the Writings which he compos'd to refute the Errors of the <HI>Habessines,</HI> set forth a Confession, of which we have already cited several parcels, as they related to our business. The chief Scope of which was, to remove that Suspition of Judaism from him∣self, and his Subjects, which in my opinion he very effectual∣ly did.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the Conversion of the <HI>Habessines</HI> to the Christian Faith.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Conversion of the <HI>Habessines</HI> attributed to Queen <HI>Candace</HI>'s Eunuch; but contrary to authentic Histories. <HI>Candace</HI> no <HI>Habessinian.</HI> Other Traditions nothing better. Demonstrated when, and by whom: To which the <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Axuma</HI> agrees. The Reasons of doubting and deciding, <HI>Frumentius</HI> how call'd. His Encomium. <HI>Cedrenus</HI> and <HI>Nicephorus</HI> refuted.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is the Common Fame among the <HI>Europeans,</HI> That the Conversion of the <HI>Habessines</HI> to the Christian Faith was be∣gun by that <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Eunuch, <HI>Acts</HI> 8.27. And perhaps the <HI>Habes∣sines</HI> themselves, believing it to be for their Honour, were the authors of the Story: confiding in the Credit of the Book of <HI>Axuma,</HI> where, the same history is set down as in the <HI>Acts of the Apostles,</HI> and without any other Circumstances: by which it may seem this story had not its first original among them, but was transcrib'd. Neither was <HI>Tzagazaabus</HI> better inform'd, as appears by his Confession of Faith. Nevertheless it seems very strange, that King <HI>David</HI> should either assert or give his assent to <HI>Alvarez</HI> asserting the same thing: whereas the Cre∣dit as well of the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> as <HI>Greek</HI> History absolutely tells us the contrary. Some endeavour a Reconciliation of this dif∣ference, as if the first dawnings of Christianity, tho but very dark and obscure, began at that time first to glimmer. But then this should have bin demonstrated by solid Reasons rela∣ting not onely to the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Nation in general, but to the <HI>Habessinians</HI> in particular. Whereas the Testimonies which we shall cite by and by do not speak of the Conversion of those that were half Christians before, but either of the <HI>Jews,</HI> or <HI>Heathens.</HI> For we have already shew'd that <HI>Candaces</HI> was never Queen of the <HI>Habessines.</HI> Neither is her Proper Name <HI>Lacasa,</HI> which we find in the Vulgar Catalogues to be found in <HI>Tellezius.</HI> For <HI>Hhendaqe,</HI> or <HI>Hindaqe,</HI> is a quite different word from <HI>Candace,</HI> from whence others casting away the Aspirate, derive the name <HI>Judith:</HI> others, as if they would correct the Error, have strain'd it to <HI>Judith.</HI> Nor was the name of <HI>Can∣dace</HI> ever known to the <HI>Habessines,</HI> tho familiar to the Inha∣bitants
<PB N="250" REF="114"/>
of <HI>Meroe.</HI> Others refer the Conversion of the <HI>Ha∣bessines</HI> not to <HI>Candace</HI>'s Eunuch, but to the times of the Apostles, and particularly ascribe it to St. <HI>Bartholmew:</HI> others to St. <HI>Matthew;</HI> or because there is no such thing to be found in his life, to St. <HI>Matthias.</HI> Of all which Fancies the <HI>Habes∣sines</HI> knew nothing, who hearing such Whimseys from our Countreymen, not without reason answer'd, <HI>That perhaps those things were to be understood of the Lower</HI> Ethiopia, <HI>that lyes between</HI> Abassia <HI>and</HI> Egypt. However we can never find out what the Success of those Apostles Preaching was: what Kings or People withstood that Conversion: what Pastors, what Ce∣remonies, what Books they made use of: what form of Disci∣pline, or what was the Doctrine of that time. Concerning all which things, in regard there is so deep a silence, we can∣not acknowledg any such beginnings of the Christian Reli∣gion in <HI>Habessinia.</HI></P>
<P>However this is certain, That both the <HI>Habessine, Grecian,</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Writers, Especially <HI>Ruffinus</HI> and his followers, agree with one consent, That the Conversion of the <HI>Ethiopian,</HI> hap∣pen'd in the time of St. <HI>Athanasius,</HI> Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria</HI> un∣der <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, about the Year of Christ 330. or not long after, and that in this manner. One <HI>Meropius,</HI> a Merchant of <HI>Tyre, (Ruffinus</HI> calls him a Philosopher) intending for <HI>India,</HI> put into Harbour upon the Coast of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> in the Red Sea, which at that time was also call'd the <HI>Indian</HI> Sea. There dy∣ing, or, as <HI>Ruffinus</HI> will have it, slain by the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> he left two Young men, <HI>Frumentius</HI> and <HI>Adesius, Fremonatum</HI> and <HI>Sy∣dracum,</HI> the <HI>Habessines</HI> call them, who being taken and brought to the King, became highly favour'd and caress'd by reason of their Ingenuity and Industry; and at length being made free of the Country, were preferr'd by the King to keep his Books and Papers. The King dying, they remain'd in the same Imployment under the Queen Regent, till the Young King came of age.</P>
<P>All this while they entertain'd the Christian Merchants that Traffick'd into those Parts, with all kindness, and did them all the good offices Imaginable, and made themselves so remarkable for their Vertue and their Integrity among those Nations, that the Christian Religion was highly esteem'd by all. Which foundation being laid, <HI>Frumentius</HI> took a Journey to St. <HI>Athanasius,</HI> Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and was by Him, for his great parts, and Constancy in the Faith,
<PB N="251" REF="114"/>
created the first Bishop of <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> Thereupon returning into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> he initiated the Inhabitants in the Christian Re∣ligion by Baptisme, then he ordain'd Presbyters and Dea∣cons, built Churches, and so introduc'd the Christian Religion into <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> Agreeable to this, are those Relations which the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> have in their Book of <HI>Axuma,</HI> onely that there is this addition to the Story of the Conversion made by <HI>Can∣dace,</HI> that these <HI>Tyrian</HI> Young men admir'd, that the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> should believe in Christ and adore the Holy Trinity, and that the Women wore Crosses upon their heads, seeing that the Gospel had bin preach'd among them by none of the Apostles. We wonder much more, that <HI>Ethiopia</HI> should be converted in the time of the Apostles, and yet have no Bi∣shop, no Baptism, no Priests nor Deacons, and that all these things should be first settled in the time of St. <HI>Athanasius.</HI> Be∣sides, no man can be easily perswaded that such a beginning should remain so long time without a farther progress, and that the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> themselves, or the Bishops of the Neigh∣bouring Christians should be so neglectful as not to lend their helping hands to the advancement of such fair Beginnings, Especially at such a time, when the Christians over the whole <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, chiefly in <HI>Egypt,</HI> suffer'd a most dreadful Per∣secution under <HI>Dioclesian.</HI> How came it to pass that they did not seek for refuge in this Kingdom out of the reach of their Enemies, where they were sure of Sanctuary and Protection from a Prince of their own Religion? Could all the Eccle∣siastical Histories, and the Annals of the Patriarch of <HI>Alexan∣dria</HI> have forgotten a Prince, the first in all the World that had receiv'd the light of the Gospel? Were there no Martyrs, whose memories the <HI>Habessines</HI> are so sollicitous to preserve? No War, no Seditions upon the change of Religion, but so great an Alteration without any noise? To assert a thing of so much moment, and yet to bring no Circumstances, no par∣ticular Events and Casualties, seems very discrepant from the Truth of History.</P>
<P>It is sufficient that the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> agree with us in the prin∣cipal matters. For whether <HI>Meropius</HI> dy'd or were slain, whe∣ther <HI>Frumentius</HI> and <HI>Edesius</HI> were call'd <HI>Fremonatus</HI> and <HI>Sydrac,</HI> signifies little. Yet in that Place <HI>Ruffinus</HI> was strangely de∣ceiv'd. For he seems with others to have meant <HI>India</HI> proper∣ly so call'd, when he neither knew the Bounds or Situation of it, where he sayes, That the Hithermost <HI>India</HI> adjoyns to
<PB N="252" REF="115"/>
<HI>Ethiopia:</HI> Between which and <HI>Parthia</HI> he places the farther∣most <HI>India.</HI> So that he makes the farthermost <HI>India</HI> nearest to <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> and <HI>Parthia</HI> more remote. This was the reason that <HI>Baronius</HI> believ'd there were two <HI>Frumentius</HI>'s; and that one was a Preacher of the Gospel at <HI>Axuma:</HI> whereas it was but one and the same person, that was Apostle and Bishop of the <HI>Habessines,</HI> call them <HI>Indians</HI> or <HI>Axumites,</HI> which you please.</P>
<P>This reconciliation of differing Writers was not known till this time, nor does he undeservedly give the honour of the discovery to the Jesuites: and that then and not before the Christian Religion was first introduc'd in <HI>Form,</HI> as he calls it; as being led by tradition also, that Christianity had some kind of bloomings before in <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> But what it was, or to what growth it arriv'd, there is no man that can unfold. Neither does <HI>Ruffinus</HI> make mention of any Jewish Religion, or any other deformed Sect that preceded. On the contrary, to use his own rough expression, he sayes, <HI>That this Land</HI> (meaning <HI>Abassia) was never broken up with the Plough-share of personal Preaching.</HI> In short, <HI>Gregory</HI> affirm'd to me, that there was not any other Preaching of the Gospel in <HI>Habessinia,</HI> then what was first begun by <HI>Abba Salma,</HI> in the time of St. <HI>Athanasius,</HI> and in the Reigns of <HI>Atzbeha,</HI> and <HI>Abreha,</HI> Brethren. And this <HI>Abba Salma</HI> was <HI>Frumentius.</HI> He is celebrated among the Metropolitans of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> in the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Liturgie, as also by our <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Poet, as being the first that display'd the light of the Gospel in those Parts; for which he gives him this Encomium.</P>
<Q><L>Peace to the Voice of Gladness I pronounce,</L>
<L>The fair Renowned <HI>Salama,</HI> for he at once</L>
<L>Did open wide the Gate of Mercy' and Grace:</L>
<L>And <HI>Ethiopia</HI> shew'd the splendid Face</L>
<L>Of Truth and Zeal by which we Christ adore,</L>
<L>Where onely Mist and Darkness dwelt before.</L></Q>
<P>Where we are to take notice of the words <HI>Mist</HI> and <HI>Dark∣ness,</HI> which the Poet would not have made use of, if, accord∣ing to the Tradition aforesaid, there had bin any knowledg of Christ in <HI>Habessinia,</HI> before that time.</P>
<P>Moreover the same Poet makes this addition upon the same subject.</P>

<P>Which Story of the first Conversion of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> being grounded upon a firm foundation, must of necessity over∣throw what<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">In the 15 year of <HI>Justinian.</HI> N. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Cedrenus,</HI> and after him<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Many famous men were deceiv'd by their Authority, as <HI>Joseph Scaliger.</HI> in emendat tem.

<P>I find the most of them mention'd by my Poet, who highly applauds them for their singular Piety, and their extraordi∣nary Miracles.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Aragawi,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Michael,</HI> he has this Enco∣mium.</P>
<Q><L>Peace be to <HI>Michael, Aragawi</HI> nam'd,</L>
<L>Wisdom his Life, his Death true Prudence fam'd.</L>
<L>With him was God, the Holy Three in One.</L>
<L>To all those Saints an everlasting Crown,</L>
<L>Who by their Prayers true Concord did enjoy,</L>
<L>That they might <HI>Arwe's</HI> Kingdom quite destroy.</L></Q>
<P>By <HI>Arwè,</HI> which signifies a Serpent, he either means in ge∣neral the <HI>Kingdom of Satan,</HI> which was destroy'd by the pro∣pagation of Christianity; or in particular the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Genti∣lism. For, as we have already said, the most ancient <HI>Ethio∣pians</HI> worship'd a Serpent, as their supream Deitie, to which the Poet seems to allude. There are to be seen to this day the Cells wherein those holy Men sequester'd themselves, by the names of <HI>Beta Pantaleon,</HI> the Domicil of <HI>St. Pantaleon</HI>
<PB N="256" REF="117"/>
in <HI>Tigra:</HI> where his Sepulcher also remains. Of whom the Poet thus,
<Q><L>Peace to <HI>Pantaleon's</HI> Bones, who study'd here,</L>
<L>In th'inner Cell, next to his Sepulcher.</L>
<L>Who by the aid of Heavens most pretious Word,</L>
<L>Speech to the dead miraculously restor'd.</L>
<L>Who by his Prayers, and his Soul-saving Voice,</L>
<L>Made the afflicted Widow soon rejoyce.</L>
<L>Her Sins were dead, but he unlock'd the grave,</L>
<L>And freed those Souls which Death did late enslave.</L></Q></P>
<P>He also makes mention of the Nine Saints in his Hymn to <HI>Likanos.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Peace be to <HI>Likanos,</HI> who of the Nine</L>
<L>Makes one, who did their Lives to God resign;</L>
<L>With lasting wreaths would they my Temples crown,</L>
<L>How should I then set forth their high renown!</L>
<L>Like lighted Lamps his fingers burn'd in prayer,</L>
<L>His Hand was pierc'd, when he the Staff did bear.</L></Q>
<P>Besides these, there are several other great Doctors among them, who have highly merited for propagating the Chri∣stian Religion; as also many Martyrs, frequently celebrated by the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> and <HI>Coptices</HI> in their Religious Panegy∣ricks. But as to their Saints, they relate of them, several Miracles more than Extraordinary: as the <HI>removing Moun∣tains, appeasing the rage of most Tempestuous Seas; raising the Dead; causing Water to spring from smitten Rocks, and walking over Ri∣vers,</HI> which are reported for common Miracles among them: so that if the Truth of the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Church were to be groun∣ded upon such Wonders, there could be no purer Religion in the World. For tho we have a <HI>St. Martin,</HI> that gave a piece of his Cloak to one in necessity, they have among 'em a Saint, that parted with his whole Garment to relieve the distressed. There are among them not onely several Stories of persons <HI>that have walk'd upon the Asp and the Basilisk, and trampled upon the Dragon and the Lyon,</HI> but also those who have rode upon those Beasts, as upon Horses and Mules. Never were the <HI>Ascetae</HI> more austere. There are some who have liv'd for whole days together upon three little Dates, others upon no more than one poor little dry Bisket.</P>
<P>But there is not one more renowned for Sanctity among them, then <HI>Gabra-Menfes-Keddus,</HI> or the <HI>Servant of the Holy Ghost,</HI> in honour of whom they keep a Holyday every month.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="117"/>Next to him is <HI>Tecla-Haimanot,</HI> or the <HI>Plant of Faith,</HI> who restor'd the Monastical way of Living, in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> about the Year of Christ 600. Whom the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Poet extolls in a most singular manner.</P>
<Q><L>All hail to thy Navity, great Saint,</L>
<L>It was at first thy Mothers great Complaint,</L>
<L>That she should barren dye, till th' Angels Voice</L>
<L>Declar'd thy Birth, and made her Son rejoyce.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Tecla-Haimanot</HI> Thou didst appear</L>
<L>Like to the Sun, that rules the Day and Year:</L>
<L>Thy Glory fill'd the Earth from end to end,</L>
<L>And to the Heavens thy Luster did ascend.</L></Q>
<P>This Austere way of Living was first practiz'd in <HI>Thebais;</HI> a Desert of <HI>Egypt,</HI> whither many Pious men had retir'd them∣selves from the Persecution of the Heathen, that through abstinence and temperance they might be more intent upon the Duty of Prayer. Among the rest, St. <HI>Antonie,</HI> as it were the Captain of the Hermites, prescrib'd certain Lawes to be observ'd by the Professors of this sort of severity: for which reason, next to <HI>Paul,</HI> he was look'd upon as its first Institutor. The Affairs of the Church being settl'd, many <HI>Anchorites,</HI> in imitation of him, voluntarily chose a solitary way of Living: for that reason call'd <HI>Monachi, Monks,</HI> or People that liv'd alone by themselves. Some meerly out of a Pious and godly end; some out of an opinion of merit; some out of vain∣glory and a desire of worldly fame; because they found that austerity of life, as being a thing hard to be undergone, was vulgarly much admir'd and highly applauded. Many also did not think it sufficient to abstain from lawful enjoyments, or to bridle and restrain the ordinary desires of Nature, but voluntarily tormented themselves with new invented Tor∣tures, or macerated themselves with hunger and famine. This Custome spread it self also into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> where some without any advantage to themselves or others, invented se∣veral ways of afflicting their own Carcasses: as for exam∣ple, <HI>To stand whole days together in cold water, to gird their Loyns with a heavy Chain, to feed onely upon Pot-herbs and Roots,</HI> and that very sparingly too. Nay, which is hardly to be credited, some there were, who would thrust themselves into the clefts
<PB N="258" REF="118"/>
of Trees, and so as those clos'd together again, suffer'd them∣selves to be bury'd alive.</P>
<P>To <HI>Antonie</HI> succeeded <HI>Macarius,</HI> after whom liv'd St. <HI>Pa∣chom,</HI> to whom in <HI>Ethiopia</HI> succeeded <HI>Aragawi,</HI> the first Abbot or Ruler over Monks among the <HI>Abessinians.</HI></P>

</LIST>
Who left bequeath'd his <HI>Asqema,</HI> that is, the <HI>Badge of his Ab∣botship,</HI> or his Monastical Habit to <HI>Tecla-Haimanot.</HI> For the Tradition is among them, That the Arch-Angel St. <HI>Michael</HI> brought that Habit to St. <HI>Antonie,</HI> for which reason it was afterwards deliver'd from Successor to Successor, as it were from one hand to another. The Greek word it self is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Schema. Alphonsus</HI> the Patriarch compares it to a <HI>Scapulary.</HI> The Life of this Saint is extant in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> written at large, and stufft with several Miracles, and render'd famous for several Apparitions and Pilgrimages. Mention is also made of him in the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Church Registers after this manner.</P>
<Q>Remember Lord the Soul of thy Servant our Father, <HI>Tecla-Haimanot,</HI> and all his Companions.</Q>
<P>This <HI>Tecla-Haimanot</HI> gave new Rules and Precepts to his Monks, and order'd them to submit themselves to a Gover∣nour, who is call'd <HI>Icegue,</HI> and is always of highest authority and dignity next to the <HI>Abuna.</HI> He either Visits his fellow Monks himself, or sends some one in his stead to reform Errors and punish transgressions. Before the Kingdom of <HI>Shewa</HI> was won by the <HI>Gallans,</HI> he had his habitation in a place call'd <HI>Debra Libanos,</HI> or the <HI>Mountain of Libanus,</HI> which was af∣terwards translated into <HI>Bagemdra.</HI> And hence it is, that <HI>Tesfa-tzejon,</HI> who set forth the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> New Testament, in the Epilogue to St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> thus speaks of himself and his fellow Monks.</P>
<Q>We are all the Sons of our Father <HI>Tecla Haimanot,</HI> of the Monastery of Mount <HI>Libanus.</HI></Q>
<P><PB N="259" REF="118"/>The other Abbot or Governour of the Monks call'd <HI>Eusta∣thius,</HI> is no less famous than he, nor is his Memory less esteem'd in their Sacred Registers, while they cry,
<Q>Remember, Lord, our Father <HI>Eustathius,</HI> with all his Chil∣dren.</Q></P>
<P>Of him the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Poet thus sings:
<Q><L>Hail to thy pretious Mantle, once the Boate,</L>
<L>Which with thy Burden on the Sea did floate;</L>
<L>Thy Pilgrimage a mighty Wonder shew'd,</L>
<L>Th'Obedient Ocean smooth and smiling slow'd</L>
<L>And Rocks remov'd, abandon'd ancient Rest,</L>
<L>To give free Passage where thy footsteps prest.</L></Q></P>
<P>He also prescrib'd Laws to his followers, but impos'd no Governour upon them, neither are they very solicitous about that neglect; pretending, <HI>That</HI> Eustathius <HI>went into</HI> Armenia, <HI>having nam'd no Successor; and that therefore it is not lawful for them to appoint any one.</HI> Every Abbot therefore is Supreme in his own Monastery; and if any one dye, another is chosen by the Suffrages of the rest of the Monks. <HI>Habessinia</HI> is full of these sort of people, to the great burthen of the Common∣wealth, to which they are no way profitable; as being use∣less in the Field, and free from Tribute. However their Rules and Orders are very much different both from the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Latins.</HI> For excepting their <HI>Sheemas</HI> and Crosses which they carry, you can hardly distinguish them from the Laitie: in regard they neither wear any <HI>Coat</HI> or Monastical Habit. Nor do they live in Monasteries, but in some Village in scat∣ter'd Cottages near to some Church or Temple. They have certain Prayers of which they say such a number, believing their Piety fully satisfy'd if they finish their Task; which that they may make the more hast to accomplish, they huddle over the Psalms of <HI>David</HI> with such a dextrous celerity, that I who have heard 'em at <HI>Rome,</HI> holding the same Copy in my hand, could never follow them with my voice, and hardly with my eyes. Every one manures his own Ground, and lives upon the product of his Labours, of which they are also very liberal. Otherwise they go and come, every one without controul, as they please themselves. So that by no means
<PB N="260" REF="119"/>
their Farms can be call'd Cloysters, nor they be said to be re∣ally Monks, but onely unmarried Husbandmen, and that onely while they preserve their Continency intire. How∣ever they are branded with infamy, if they forsake their Monastical way of living to marry Wives. Nor are their Children capable of being admitted into the Clergy; and it is taken for an affront to call any man the Son of a Monk. Nevertheless they bear Civil Offices, and are sometimes made Governors of Provinces, as is apparent by the Example of <HI>Tzagazaabus;</HI> who was a Monk, as appears from <HI>Alvarez</HI>'s Itinerary. Of such as these the Question may be ask'd with St. <HI>Jerome, If thou desirest to be accompted a Monk, what doest thou do in the Cities, what in the Camp, or why dost thou undertake Civil Employments?</HI> They could not choose but highly displease the Fathers of the Society; which is the reason, that they have always spoken of them with contempt: on the other side, the Monks have bin the main Obstacles of the Fathers Successes; for which Reason, <HI>Tellezius</HI> calls them Persecu∣tors of the Catholic Faith. Their Monasteries (if we may so call their Villages) are very numerous and dispierc'd over all Parts of the Kingdom: and commonly go by the name of <HI>Daber,</HI> a Mountain; in the plural number <HI>Adebaruti,</HI> Moun∣tains: as, <HI>Dabra Bizen, Dabra Hallelujah, Dabra Damo, Alba∣mata,</HI> and the like, as being formerly built upon steep Hills: Beside which, they possess all the Ilands in the <HI>Tzanic Lake,</HI> except <HI>Deka.</HI></P>

<HEAD>An Addition to the Third Chapter, concerning their Nuns.</HEAD>
<P>THat there are also Nuns in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> I gather from <HI>Telle∣zius.</HI> But they are very ignorant, and therefore the more obstinate in their devotion. For proof of which, the same <HI>Tellezius</HI> produces a very remarkable Story of one, who by chance becoming blind, was admonish'd by one of the <HI>Fathers,</HI> to make Confession, and embrace the <HI>Latin</HI> Religion, unless she intended to go headlong to Hell. To which the Nun made answer, <HI>That she was willing to go thither of her own accord, for that she found there was no Room for her in Heaven, as being a person with whom God was displeas'd, and had therefore de∣priv'd her of her sight, without any cause of offence by her committed.</HI>
<PB N="261" REF="119"/>
Upon which the Father press'd her the more urgently, in hopes to deliver her from that more dangerous blindness of her Mind. But finding her to continue obstinate after all his pains. <HI>Since then,</HI> said he, <HI>thou refusest Heav'n, get thee to Hell with all the Devils, with</HI> Dathan <HI>and</HI> Abiram. <HI>But I would not have thee take thy Religious Habit along with thee, which is onely proper for those that desire the Joyes of Heaven.</HI> And so saying, he presently order'd her to put off her Nuns Vestments, and to put on a sordid Vulgar Habit; which wrought in her such a sadness and contrition, that she soon after made her con∣fession, and reconcil'd her self to the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the Sacred Books of the <HI>Habessines.</HI></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> together with the Christian Religion, receiv'd the Holy Scripture, according to the Version of the <HI>70</HI> Interpreters—the New Testament from an Imperfect Copy and ill Printed. The Old Testament divided into four parts: The New Testament into as many- The <HI>Reve∣lation</HI> added as an Appendix. To the New Testament are added the Constitutions and Canons of the Apostles, as they call them, divided into Eight parts: Therefore they reckon several Sacred Books. Three Oecu∣menical Councils. A fair Manuscript of the Councils at <HI>Rome.</HI> Books therein contain'd. A Counterfeit Book of <HI>Enoch.</HI> Magical Prayers. Where∣in Monstrous words seeming to be taken from the <HI>Jews.</HI> The Form of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Anathematizing.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>DIvine Worship</HI> is seldom found among any sort of Nations in the World to be without Books, by which we apprehend from whence every particular kind of worship derives it self, and by what means it got footing among the People: for the words and the worship generally go together. Which is the reason there are so many Hebrew and Greek words in all the Versions of the Bible, and that we have so many Latin words in our Theologie.</P>
<P>The <HI>Habessines</HI> together with the Christian Religion re∣ceiv'd the holy Scripture. And this Scripture was translated into that Idiom of the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Language, which was at that time more peculiar to the Inhabitants of <HI>Tigra,</HI> from the Greek Version of the Seventy Interpreters, according to a certain Copy us'd in the Church of <HI>Alexandria;</HI> which the in∣numerable
<PB N="262" REF="120"/>
various Readings, that are inserted into the <HI>English Polyglòtton</HI> Bibles, from one of the same Copies, plainly de∣monstrate, with which the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Translation perfectly agrees, Especially in the 35 &amp; 39 Chapter of <HI>Exodus,</HI> which in other Copies are wonderfully mutilated. Nor is it with∣out reason that a Colonie, as it were, of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Church, should follow the Sacred Copies of their <HI>Metropolis.</HI> As for the Author and Time of the Translation, I find no∣thing certainly deliver'd concerning either: however it is most probable that it was begun at the time when the <HI>Habes∣sines</HI> were<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">There is one who has written a certain <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Martyrologie, who as∣serts, That <HI>Frumentius,</HI> otherwise <HI>Abba-Salama,</HI> was the Author of the first Translation; but before I see it, I will not undertake to affirm it.</NOTE> converted, or a very short time after, and not in the time of the Apostles, as some have reported; and brought to perfection by several; because the more rare and difficult words, such as are the names of Gemms, are not all alike in all the Books. For example, the <HI>Topaz</HI> in the 118 <HI>Psalm,</HI> 127 <HI>Verse,</HI> is call'd <HI>Pazjon,</HI> in <HI>Job</HI> 28.19. <HI>Tankar,</HI> in <HI>Revela∣tions</HI> the 21.20. <HI>Warauri:</HI> and so in many other words the same difference is observ'd.</P>
<P>But for the <HI>New Testament,</HI> they have it Translated from the Authentic Greek Text, tho as yet it has not bin brought into <HI>Europe</HI> pure and intire. For the <HI>Roman</HI> Edition is printed from a lame imperfect Copy, so that I was forc'd to fill up the Gapps which <HI>Tesfa-Tzejon</HI> had left, from the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Exemplars. This was observ'd by some Learned Men, but not understanding the Cause, it made them think that the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Version had bin drawn from the Vulgar Latin. Per∣haps they did not understand these following <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Lines.</P>
<P><HI>These Acts of the Apostles, for the most part, were translated at</HI> Rome <HI>out of the Latin, and Greek, for want of the</HI> Ethiopic <HI>Origi∣ginal. For what we have added or omitted, we begg your pardon, and request of You to mend what is amiss.</HI></P>
<P>More then this, the Publisher of the Book beggs pardon, and excuses the defect of the Edition, in regard of the igno∣rant Assistants which he had to help him.</P>
<P><HI>Fathers and Brethren, be pleas'd not to interpret amiss the faults
<PB N="263" REF="120"/>
of this Edition; for they who Compos'd it could not read; and for our selves we know not how to compose. So then we help'd them, and they assisted us, as the blind leads the blind; and therefore we de∣sire you to pardon us and them.</HI></P>
<P>This Excuse he also repeats in other places, as being con∣scious of its being defective in several other places. Never∣theless the same Edition was afterwards printed in <HI>England,</HI> as an addition to that famous <HI>Poly Glotton;</HI> of which there is no other reason to be given, but that there was no other to be pro∣cur'd.</P>
<P>However they enjoy the holy Scripture entire, and reck'n as many Books as we do, tho they divide them after another manner. For they distinguish the Old Testament, which contains 46 Books into four Principal parts; to which they joyn certain other Books of a different Argument consult∣ing more, perhaps, the Convenience of the Volumes, then the Dignity of the Matter. They also mix the <HI>Apocryphal</HI> with the Canonical, whether out of Carelesness or Ignorance is uncertain. And as for <HI>Gregory,</HI> he plainly confess'd he had never heard of any such word as <HI>Apocrypha.</HI></P>

<P>To which they add as a Supplement, the <HI>Vision of John,</HI> sirnam'd <HI>Abukalamsis:</HI> A word corrupted out of the Greek <HI>Apocalypsis,</HI> which they ignorantly took for the Sirname of St. <HI>John,</HI> as compounded of the Arabic word <HI>Abu</HI> &amp; <HI>Kalamsis.</HI> Here we are to observe, that in the written Eastern Copies, the Epistles of St. <HI>Paul</HI> are found single by themselves; and this is the reason that in the <HI>Roman</HI> Copy of the <HI>Ethiopic New Testament,</HI> they were Printed apart, and not in the Order by us observ'd.</P>
<P>To the <HI>New Testament</HI> they generally annex a Volume, which they call, according to the Greek word, <HI>Synodum,</HI> or the <HI>Book of Synods.</HI> It contains those most ancient Constitu∣tions, which are call'd the <HI>Constitutions of the Apostles:</HI> in their Language <HI>Tazazate, Precepts,</HI> or <HI>Canons,</HI> being an Explana∣tion
<PB N="266" REF="122"/>
of the Primitive Rites and Ceremonies, written by the Industry of St. <HI>Clement,</HI> but they are very much different from those that are dispers'd among Us under the name of the Apostles. These the <HI>Habessines</HI> divide into eight parts, add∣ing withall to the Canonical Writings of the Evangelists, and Apostles, as it were certain <HI>Novels,</HI> as if they were of the same Authority, and the most absolute Pandects of Christiani∣ty. Hence it was, that King <HI>David</HI> said to <HI>Alvaresius,</HI> That he had Fourscore and one Books of Sacred Scripture; that is to say, Six and forty of Old Testament (reck'ning the <HI>Lamenta∣tions</HI> by themselves), and Thirty five of the New Testament, adding to the <HI>Twenty seven,</HI> those Eight Books of Constitu∣tions and Canons, which the Ethiopians call <HI>Manda</HI> &amp; <HI>Abte∣lis,</HI> the Signification of which were unknown to <HI>Gregory,</HI> as being words altogether Exotic. This was also the reason why <HI>Tefa-Tzejon</HI> has this Expression in the Title of the New Testament, <HI>I have caus'd a New Copy to be Printed, but without a Synod,</HI> because he did not Print together with the said Co∣py, those Canons and Institutions before specify'd. Next to this Book which is also call'd <HI>Hadas,</HI> or absolutely <HI>New,</HI> the chiefest Reverence is given to the three Oecumenic Councils, the <HI>Nicene, Constantinopolitan,</HI> and <HI>Ephesine,</HI> with some other Provincial Councils, which were receiv'd in the Church till the <HI>Schism</HI> of <HI>Chalcedon.</HI> But we are to under∣stand, that beside the Twenty <HI>Nicene</HI> Canons, always re∣ceiv'd by the Greek and Latin Church, they also admit of Eighty four other Canons, which are extant among the Copies in the Arabic Language. And these in the foregoing Century, <HI>Baptista</HI> the Jesuit Transcrib'd and brought to <HI>Rome,</HI> where they were Translated into Latin. They were all formerly fairly written in Parchment, and by <HI>Zer-a-Jacob</HI> or <HI>Constantine,</HI> Emperor of the <HI>Habassines</HI> in the year 440. sent to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and thence brought to <HI>Rome</HI> in the year 1646. where I saw it in the <HI>Habessine</HI> House, in the year 1649. It contains the following Books:

<P>Adjoyning to this Book are the Liturgy, or the Publick Prayers for the Use of the whole Ethiopic Church.

For there we find it written concerning the Holy Ghost, <HI>who proceeds from the Father and the Son;</HI> which latter proceeding neither the Greeks nor Ethiopians admit.</P>

So soon as that noble Gentleman heard of this Book, he spar'd for no Cost to get it into his hands; till at length the Knave∣ry of those he employ'd, impos'd upon him another Book with a false Title. The Book was afterwards lodg'd in Cardinal <HI>Mazarine</HI>'s Library, and the Preface, Middle and End being Transcrib'd by a Friend of mine, was presented to me, but there was nothing in it either of <HI>Enoch</HI> or his Pre∣dictions; only some few Notions there were, and some very clear discourses of the Mysteries of Heaven and Earth, and the Holy Trinity, under the Name of one <HI>Abba-Bahaila-Michael.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of the Religion of the <HI>Habassines</HI> at this Day.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Reports of <HI>Matthew</HI> the <HI>Armenian</HI> and <HI>Tzagazaab</HI> false or uncer∣tain. The Fathers have omitted their soundest Opinions—And fix'd their several Errors upon them. The Confession of <HI>Claudius</HI> Genuine. The great Authority of the Synodal Writers. They admit the <HI>Nicene</HI> and other Councils till that of <HI>Chalcedon.</HI> They acknowledge the Trinity, one Person of Christ, and his sufficient Merit. The Proceeding of the Holy Ghost from the Son they deny. <HI>Gregorie</HI>'s Dispute and Opinion. The <HI>Ethiopian</HI> interpretation of the word <HI>Proceed.</HI> The Sacraments, Baptism, Communion under both Kinds. The real Presence. The words they use in Reference to it. <HI>Gregorie</HI>'s Opinion of Transubstantiation. Of the Soul after Death. They pray for the Dead. Deny Purgatory. <HI>Gregorie</HI>'s Opinion concerning it. The Original of Prayer for the Dead. They pray to Saints and Angels. Their Catechism for Chil∣dren and <HI>Neophytes.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WEre the Symbolical Book of the <HI>Habessines,</HI> which they call <HI>Hajmanot-Abau</HI> to be found in <HI>Europe,</HI> we might easily Collect from thence, the true and genuine Sence and Doctrine of the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Church concerning the Heads and Articles of the Chri∣stian Faith: for hitherto we find the most of them uncer∣tainly deliver'd, and for the Confession of Faith set down by <HI>Matthew</HI> the <HI>Armenian,</HI> and <HI>Tzagazaab,</HI> we have already taken notice of the failings in it. The Fathers of the Socie∣ty, that have been conversant among the <HI>Habessines</HI> both in this and the former Century, and frequently discours'd with their Learned Men, passing by their sound and serious Opinions, tax them of many Errors which they have receiv'd from the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Jews.</HI> As for Example,</P>
<P><HI>That the Spirit proceeds only from the Father.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That the Human Nature of Christ is equal to his Divinity.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="124"/><HI>They acknowledge but one Will and one Operation in Christ; for which reason they believe that we affirm Four Persons in the Godhead, seeing that we confess two Wills and two Natures in Christ.</HI></P>
<P><HI>They repeat the Ceremony of Baptism every year upon the Feast of the</HI> Epiphany.</P>
<P><HI>They believe that the Souls of the Just shall not be receiv'd into Heaven before the end of the World; nor do they think them to be Created, but produc'd out of Matter.</HI></P>
<P><HI>They neither confess the Number, nor the particular Species of their Sins, but cry in general, I have sin'd, I have sin'd.</HI></P>
<P><HI>They use not the Sacrament</HI> of <HI>Chrism, nor Extream Unction upon the approach of Death; nor do they mind the Consolation of the bread of life. Insomuch that many of them stick not to say, That they who follow the</HI> Roman <HI>Religion, are not only</HI> Heretics, <HI>but worse than the</HI> Mahumetans.</P>
<P><HI>They reject the Council of</HI> Chalcedon, <HI>casting many reproaches upon</HI> Leo <HI>the Great; but highly applauding</HI> Dioscurus.</P>
<P><HI>They deny Purgatory.</HI></P>
<P>These things I chose to deliver almost in the very words of <HI>Godignus,</HI> who Collected them out of the Relations and Letters of <HI>Gonzalez Rodoric, Alphonsus de Franca, Emanuel Fer∣nandez,</HI> and others of the Society. Neither do they seem to be improbable; but how they evade or excuse them, we shall shortly declare. As to what is said that some of them believe the Followers of the <HI>Romish</HI> Religion to be worse than <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> I could not hear any such thing from <HI>Gregory:</HI> neither did he think it was to be understood in reference to their Doctrine, but their Tyranny over their Subjects; it being the Custom of the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> only to vex and oppress all those who are under their Power, professing a Religion contrary to theirs, but never to rage against them with Fire and Sword.</P>
<P>In the mean time we have a Confession set forth by King <HI>Claudius;</HI> but the scope of that Confession was only to clear himself and his Subjects from the Imputation of <HI>Judaism,</HI> which he found to be the only reason that impeded the Amity between him and the <HI>Portugals.</HI> Therefore leaving this Confession, by what we can gather from their Publick Liturgies, and the Writings and Sayings of Persons, both Publick and Private, the sum of the <HI>Habessinian</HI> Doctrine seems to consist of the following Heads.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="125"/>First, They acknowledge the <HI>Holy Scripture</HI> to be the sole and only <HI>Rule</HI> of what they are to believe, and what they are to do: insomuch that King <HI>David</HI> said to <HI>Alvarez,</HI> That if the Pope should impose upon Him or His Subjects, any thing what the Apostles had not written or permitted, he would not obey him; nor his own <HI>Metropolitan</HI> if he should attempt to do the like. But with the Scripture they are so much in love, that there is nothing more de∣lightful to their Ears, than the repetition of it. There∣fore saith <HI>Tellez,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nothing more pleas'd the</HI> Habessines <HI>than to hear the Scripture often quoted in Sermons; and the more Citations a man brings out of Scripture, the more learned be is accompted.</HI></P>
<P>Nor do they give much less Credit to the Three Oecu∣menical Councils, as appears by the Confession of <HI>Claudius.</HI> They generally make use of the <HI>Nicene Creed,</HI> which they call <HI>Tzalot Hajmanot, the Prayer of the Faith.</HI> That which we use they have not, no more than all the rest of the Eastern Churches; a strong Argument, that it was not compil'd by the Apostles, tho' in regard of the Doctrine which it con∣tains, it may be truly call'd <HI>Apostolic.</HI> For certainly the <HI>Ni∣cene</HI> Fathers would not have stifl'd such a Creed, or set forth another of their own, had the Apostles left such an Epitome of their Doctrine behind them. The Ancient Greek Coun∣cils then are the Councils which the <HI>Habessines</HI> have in reve∣rence, together with the Eighty four ancient Canons added to those of the <HI>Nicene</HI> Council, till they come to that of <HI>Chal∣cedon,</HI> which they do not only utterly reject, but also Crimi∣nally reproach.</P>
<P>Whatever therefore the Catholic Church admitted and believ'd before that Council, concerning God, Three in one; the Three distinct Persons in one Essence; the Eternity of the Son of God, the Existence of the Holy Ghost, and o∣ther Articles of Faith, all those things the <HI>Habessines</HI> willing∣ly consent to and allow, condemning those that Dispute against them. By the way, we are here to observe, that the Ethiopic words, <HI>Sabsatu Gaz Gaz Egza Bahr,</HI> Three Persons and one God, are vulgarly ill Translated, being to have bin render'd, <HI>Three Faces, One Lord;</HI> for the word <HI>Gaz,</HI> signifies as well the <HI>Face</HI> or <HI>Countenance,</HI> as it bears the force of the Greek word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>Person.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="125"/>The Nestorian Heresie asserting two Persons in Christ, they so abhor, that for that very reason they will not ad∣mit of his two Natures, and two Wills, tho they positive∣ly acknowledge his Divinity and Humanity. For they af∣firm Christ to be true and perfect God; and also true and perfect Man, and to consist in one Individual Person of Divinity and Humanity, without Confusion and Com∣mixtion.</P>
<P>Farthermore, They acknowledge the most Sacred Merits of Christ; to be most sufficient and efficacious for the Sins of the whole world, and consequently of all Mankind; and this <HI>Gregory</HI> himself affirm'd to be true: nor have I found in any of their Books which I have happen'd to see, any thing that contradicts what he asserted. However, as the Greeks do, they deny the Proceeding of the Holy Ghost from the Son; yet all this while they acknowledge him to be equally the Spirit of the Father and the Son, and to be a Person subsisting of himself. For thus they declare in their Liturgy.</P>
<P><HI>We believe the Father sending, that the Father is in his own Per∣son. And we believe the Son who is sent, that the Son is in his own Person, and we believe the Holy Ghost who descended upon</HI> Jor∣dan, <HI>and upon the Apostles, that the Holy Ghost is in his own Person; Three Names, One God. Not as</HI> Abraham <HI>who is elder than</HI> Isaac, <HI>nor as</HI> Isaac <HI>who is Elder than</HI> Jacob. <HI>It is not so, The Father is not Elder than the Son, because he is the Father, nor the Son Elder than the Holy Ghost, nor the Holy Ghost lesser or Younger than the Father and the Son, nor is the Son Younger than the Father, because he is the Son. Not as</HI> Abraham <HI>who command∣ed over</HI> Isaac <HI>in respect of Generation, because he begat him, nor as</HI> Isaac <HI>who commanded</HI> Jacob. <HI>It is not so in Divinity; The Father does not command the Son, because he is the Father; nei∣ther is the Son greater than the Holy Ghost, because he is the Son. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are Equal; One God, one Glory, one Kingdom, one Power, one Empire.</HI></P>
<P>But concerning the <HI>Hypostasis,</HI> or Person of the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> really distinct from the <HI>Father</HI> and the <HI>Son,</HI> the Author of the <HI>Organon</HI> thus discourses.</P>
<P>But least any one, from what has been already said, should infer, that the Holy Ghost is not a perfect and distinct Per∣son;
<PB N="274" REF="126"/>
therefore said Christ to his Apostles, <HI>I will send you ano∣ther Comforter.</HI> By which we know that the Holy Ghost doth exist together with the Father and the Son, and also to∣gether in his own proper Subsistance or Person. Not that the Holy Ghost is partly in the Son, partly in his own Person, but one and the same, existent in his proper Person, and exi∣stent with the Father and the Son.</P>
<P><HI>Gregory</HI> being ask'd, whether this were the unanimous and constant Opinion of all the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Doctors? reply'd, <HI>It was.</HI> I thereupon urg'd, <HI>Why they deny'd that the Holy Ghost proceeded from the Father? seeing they asserted, that he was equally the Spirit of the Father and the Son? He desir'd, That I would first expound what was meant by Proceeding from the Father,</HI> and then he would give the reason of the Denyal; and that for his part, he kept to the words of the Scripture, <HI>John</HI> 15.26. and 16.24. <HI>Who goeth out from the Father, and takes from the Son;</HI> and that he sought no farther. For that it was not lawful in Disputes concerning the most abstruse Mysteries of the Holy Trinity, to argue by Consequences; but to stick close to the very words and Expressions of Scripture them∣selves. That I should consider what would follow, if we should argue from the Unity and Equality of Essence to the Characteristical Proprieties of the Persons. As if any one should undertake to averr, <HI>That Christ is the Son of the Holy Ghost, because the Holy Ghost is one and Coeternal God with the Father.</HI> Some such kind of Argument his Countryman <HI>Tzagazaab</HI> may be thought to have had in his Brain, when he wrote, That Christ was the Son of himself, and the Beginning of him∣self, because he was co-essential with the Father, whose Son he was. By the way we are to understand, That the <HI>Ethiopi∣ans,</HI> instead of the word <HI>Vazzea, went forth or proceeded,</HI> and in the Preterperfect tense, use the word <HI>Saraz,</HI> to <HI>budd</HI> or <HI>sprout forth.</HI> Thus <HI>Claudius</HI> in his Confession.</P>
<P><HI>I believe in the Holy Ghost, reviving Lord,</HI> Zasratz em Ab, <HI>who proceeded or sprung from the Father.</HI></P>
<P>They never add from the Son, altho the Liturgy Printed at <HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>Tzagazaab</HI>'s Confession runs thus, <HI>Zasraz em Ab vavalde,</HI> who sprouted forth or proceeded from the Fa∣ther and the Son. Where 'tis much to be doubted, that <HI>from the Son</HI> was inserted by another hand</P>
<P>We proceed to the <HI>Sacraments,</HI> of which they neither have the common name nor number. For they are utterly igno∣rant
<PB N="275" REF="126"/>
of <HI>Confirmation</HI> and <HI>Extreme Unction.</HI> They make use of the word <HI>Mastar,</HI> for a <HI>Mysterie,</HI> whenever they go about to intimate the Mysterie of the Participation of the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ. Otherwise they do not think it necessary, to signifie the <HI>Seals of Faith,</HI> by any other Vulgar name not us'd in Scripture, or to make much dispute about the Number. Only said <HI>Gregory,</HI> They make use of <HI>Bap∣tism</HI> according to the Institution of Christ, and with the Ce∣remonies anciently made use of by the Church. But the Fathers of the Society reported, That the Ceremonies of Baptism were so deprav'd and corrupted among the <HI>Habes∣sines,</HI> that they were constrain'd to Rebaptize great Num∣bers under a Condition.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Holy Communion,</HI> they Administer it indifferently to all, both Layety and Clergy, as it is the Custom in all the Churches of the East. Neither has any thing more alienated their minds from the <HI>Fathers,</HI> than their finding the Layety to be depriv'd of the Cup by the Latins. <HI>Gregory</HI> being de∣manded what he thought of the real Presence of the Body and Blood in the <HI>Lord's Supper?</HI> made answer, That he ac∣knowledged it. Adding withal, according to his manner, when any Discourses arose of Matters more difficult and ab∣struse than ordinary, <HI>Retzitze nagare vet,</HI> 'tis a nice business; or, <HI>Mastar vet, It is a Mystery.</HI> When I produc'd him these words in the Liturgies.</P>
<P><HI>Lord now lay thy hand upon this Dish, Bless it, Sanctifie it, and Purifie it, that so thy Body may be made holy therein.</HI></P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P><HI>Lay thy hand upon this Cup, and now bless it, sanctifie it, and purifie it, that thy Blood may become holy therein.</HI></P>
<P>In another place.</P>
<P><HI>Lay thy hand upon this Spoon of the Cross, to prepare the Body and Blood of thy only Son our Lord and God.</HI></P>
<P>And in another place,</P>
<P><HI>Convert this Bread, that it may become thy pure Body, which is joyn'd with this Cup of thy most precious Blood.</HI></P>
<P>And out of the Eucharistic Prayer, which bears the Title of the 318 <HI>Orthodox Divines,</HI> these following words:</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="127"/><HI>Let the Holy Ghost descend, and come and shine upon this Bread, that it may be made the Body of Christ our Lord, and that the taste and savour of this Cup may be chang'd, that so it may be made the Blood of Christ our Lord.</HI></P>
<P>And when I ask'd him withal the Exposition of the words <HI>Majete vat valto,</HI> to <HI>be chang'd or converted;</HI> and then demand∣ed of him, <HI>Whether he did not think that the substance of the Bread and Wine was not chang'd and converted into the Substance of the Body and Blood of Christ?</HI> He made answer, <HI>That no such sort of Transubstantiation was known or understood by the</HI> Habessines. <HI>That his Countrymen were not so scrupulous, nor us'd to start such thorny Questions. Nevertheless it seem'd to him probable and like, that the vulgar Bread and Wine was chang'd into the mysterious Representation of the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ;</HI> and so was alter'd from Prophane to Sacred, to represent the true Body and Blood of Christ to the Communicants. <HI>Tellez</HI> confesses his dissatisfaction touching their Consecration, it being their Custom to say over the Body of Christ, <HI>This bread is my Body;</HI> and over the Wine, <HI>This cup is my Blood.</HI> Which words have not in them the true force of Consecration. For the Doctors of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church are of Opinion, That whoever speaks those words, does nothing; These words, <HI>This is my Body,</HI> being only of Efficacy to operate a true Transubstantiation. Which being true, no man can pretend that the <HI>Abessines</HI> ac∣knowlege Transubstantiation, especially seeing they do not attribute those Divine Honours to the Sacraments, which the Consequences of real Transubstantiation require.</P>
<P>Concerning the state of the Soul after Death, there are se∣veral Opinions among the <HI>Habessines,</HI> every one having free Liberty of Opinion in those things that do not directly con∣cern Eternal Salvation. So that it is no wonder that so ma∣ny various Sentiments of private persons are brought away by our Doctors, as the publick Opinions of the <HI>Habessines.</HI></P>
<P>Some of them believe that the Souls of Men piously de∣ceased, shall not behold the Beatifical Vision of God before the Resurrection of the Body; which is also the Opinion of many of the Ancient Latins: as if the Soul remain'd in Ex∣pectation of the Body in some certain third place. Others, convinc'd by the Authority of the Scripture, <HI>acknowledge on∣ly two Mansions of the Souls, Heaven and Hell; believing no Damnatinn to those that are in Christ, and dye in his Faith.</HI>
<PB N="277" REF="127"/>
Which they gather from the Example of the Penitent Thief, and the words of Christ, thus Translated by the <HI>Ethiopians,</HI>
<Q>Verily I say unto thee, firmly believe, that thou shalt be with me in Paradice.</Q></P>
<P>Therefore, as for those that Piously sleep in Christ, they believe them not to be in a worse Condition than this Thief, who at the point of Death was sav'd through Peni∣tence actuated by Faith, without any satisfaction given for his Thieveries. Now to prove that the Soul of Man is not created, they produce this Argument, That God perfected the whole Work of his Creation upon the Sixth day. Never∣theless they believe it to be in its own Nature immortal, as being inspir'd into Man by God, at his first Creation. But on the other side, they think it very absurd that God should be ty'd to create new Souls every day for Adulterate and In∣cestuous Births.</P>
<P>However the first Opinion seems to be the more vulgar∣ly receiv'd among them; in regard of their Prayers for the Dead: As for example.</P>
<P><HI>Remember, Lord, the Souls of thy Servants, and our Father,</HI> Abba-Matthew, <HI>and the rest of our Fathers,</HI> Abba-Salama, <HI>and</HI> Abba-Jacob.</P>
<P>And a little after,</P>
<P><HI>Remember, Lord, the Kings of</HI> Ethiopia, Abreha; <HI>and</HI> Atzbeha, Caleb, <HI>and</HI> Gebra-Meskah, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Then they add,</P>
<P><HI>Release, O Lord, our Fathers</HI> Abba Antony <HI>and</HI> Abba Ma∣carius.</P>
<P><HI>Remember, Lord, the Soul of thy Servant, our Father</HI> Tecla-Hajmanot, <HI>with all his Companions.</HI></P>
<P>From whence it may be fairly justify'd, that the <HI>Abessines</HI> admit of a <HI>Purgatory.</HI> And yet <HI>Gregory</HI> constantly deny'd it. And <HI>Godignus</HI> confesses, <HI>That there are no sacred Services said for the deceas'd among the</HI> Habessines. The same thing <HI>Tellez</HI> confirms. However he derides them, as not constant to themselves; for that, <HI>to pray for the Dead, and distribute Alms
<PB N="278" REF="128"/>
to the Poor, is no other than to assert</HI> Purgatory. Nor do I see how they can reconcile their Praying for the Rest of happy Souls; and at another time, their imploring the In∣tercession of the same Souls.</P>
<P>But they nothing mov'd with these Arguments and Infe∣rences, affirm them to be <HI>the Pious Conception of their good wishes, and only a Commemoration of the happy Estate of the deceas'd; and that it is none of their business to make any farther scrutiny into the Traditions of their Ancestors. Gregory</HI> added, That <HI>many Prayers</HI> of the Christians were so conceiv'd, that many times those things were Petition'd for, which were <HI>already perform'd and answer'd. That the Lord's Prayer contain'd Petitions of that kind. For that it would be a thing but badly inferr'd, that the Name of God was not Hallow'd, or that his Will was not done both in Heaven and Earth, because we daily put up those Prayers: be∣sides we all begg every day for Daily Bread, when most of those that make that Prayer, do generally live in wealthy abundance.</HI> He had heard perhaps among us our general good Wishes for the departed, That <HI>God would vouchsafe to grant the Interr'd Body a Quiet Repose, and at length a joyful Resurrection.</HI> And thereupon, said he, <HI>Do not you your selves wish the same good wishes for the Dead? Do not you believe that the Carkasses of the Dead may be vexed with Spiritual Evils? or that a happy Resur∣rection may be obtain'd by your Prayers.</HI> And he took so heinously the suspition of his belief of Purgatory, that he cry'd out, <HI>Would it not be an irreverent Injury to so many Kings and Fathers, should we interpret the Commemoration of their Souls to that height, as to think they should be tormented for so many Ages in Purgatory, and want the aid of our indefatigable Prayers to release them after so long an Imprisonment?</HI> For those Kings and Fathers were men among the <HI>Habessines</HI> most Innocent, and had bin dead above a Thousand years since or more. So that whether they be in Paradice, or remain in any other place, expecting the Resurrection of their Bodies, in both cases Prayers of that Nature seem superfluous.</P>
<P>Besides, were there any Question to be made of the happy Condition of Men Piously deceas'd, we should rather pray for those whose lives were more loose and vain, than for those whose Conversations were without blame. And there∣fore what has bin deliver'd about the Opinions of the <HI>Ha∣bessines</HI> concerning Purgatory, leans rather upon Conjecture than any sufficient Authority, they being ignorant of the
<PB N="279" REF="128"/>
very Name. Insomuch that <HI>Jacob Wemmers</HI> the <HI>Carmelite,</HI> in his <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Lexicon, was constrain'd to forge a Word, by calling it <HI>Mantzehi Hatate,</HI> the Purger of Sin. But we are to understand, that it was the most Ancient Custom of the Church first of all to read the Names of the Holy Martyrs out of the Public Registers, as being a Duty owing to the memory of the invincible Testimonies for Christ. Which the following Ages strain'd another way, as if they had need of our Intercession; and others, as if we could not be with∣out their Intercession, made it a presence to invoke the Holy Saints, as if they were present and heard them. To which we may add, That the Ancient Christian Orators, and Wri∣ters of Homilies, making use of their Rhetorick, by vertue of that Figure, commonly call'd <HI>Prosopopocia,</HI> bespoke the blessed Saints, and introduc'd them as it were returning An∣swers; from whence it is not improbable that Suspition might introduce the Custom of giving the same Adoration to them as to God himself, and worshipping them with Temples, Altars, and other Divine Honours. Which ne∣vertheless the <HI>Habessines</HI> do not do; for though they keep Holydaies in memory of their Saints, they do not call them <HI>Bagnabat, Solemnities;</HI> but <HI>Tjabarat, Remembrances.</HI> They also invoke them, tho they know not after what manner they may be able to hear them; and beg their Intercessions also, especially of the most Holy Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> to whom they bear such an affectionate Reverence, that they think whatever the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> has invented to her Honour, all too little; and yet they erect no Statues to her memory for all that, being contented only with her Pictures. When they were in a rage against those of the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, and pursu'd 'em in their fury with Sticks and Stones, they cry'd out, <HI>Kill, Kill; whoever is not an Enemy of</HI> Marie, <HI>let him take up a Stone to stone her Enemies to Death.</HI></P>
<P>But more than this, they many times invoke the Angels, as having for that perhaps a more specious pretence, because they have bin frequently said to appear to good Men and Women, and hear their Prayers.</P>
<P>Of these the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> reckon no less than Nine Orders, which they borrow from their Names and Epithites given them in Sacred Scripture.</P>
<P><HI>Malaeket,</HI> Angels particularly so call'd, or by another Name, <HI>Manofsat, Spirits; Bitean Malaeket; Arch-Angels.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of the Rites and Ceremonies of the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Church, as also of the <HI>Habessine</HI> Temples.</HEAD>

<P>Sacred Rites often an Occasion of Disturbance in the Church. The Prudent Decree of the Apostles. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Condescension necessary. <HI>Judaish</HI> Rites retain'd. Many new Ceremonies invented by the Pope, by the <HI>Alexan∣drian</HI> Metropolitan none. The most ancient Ceremonies retain'd by the <HI>Abessines.</HI> Their Churches dark, like the Synagogues.

The defect of it supply'd, The time and place for the Holy Supper. Two Holydaies in a Week. They want Bells. Their Music unpleasing, yet they Daunce about.

Their manner of Computation, Nuptial Rites. Polygamy. Marriages of Cousin Germans, or first Cousins. Divorces. Burials.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HItherto we have set forth what the <HI>Habessines</HI> believe concerning the <HI>Trinity,</HI> &amp; the Principal Articles of the Christian Faith. The order of our Story now requires that we should say something of their Rites and Ceremonies. For tho it nothing avail at what time or in what manner sound Doctrine be Preach'd, so that all things be done de∣cently and in order; nevertheless these Rites and Ceremo∣nies have begat great Disputes, and produc'd great Distur∣bances in the Church.</P>
<P>For indeed from the very Infancy of the Gospel, vari∣ous were the Contentions of Holy and Pious men about Ce∣remonies. Some believ'd that the <HI>Judaic</HI> Rites, not being ex∣presly abrogated by Christ, were of necessity to be observ'd, together with the Doctrine and Sacraments of the New Te∣stament,
<PB N="284" REF="131"/>
even as helps to Salvation. Others there were who judg'd that they might be profitably retain'd, though not of absolute necessity, as well in remembrance of the ancient Church of God, as to gain the Souls of the <HI>Jews.</HI> The first Opinion the Apostles themselves Condemn'd. In other things using Apostolic Prudence and Moderation, they made a distinction betwen <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Ethnics</HI> newly Converted. For they not only permitted the <HI>Jews</HI> to retain their ancient Rites, but perswaded <HI>Paul</HI> to comply with so many Millions of unbelieving <HI>Jews,</HI> who were Zealous Admirers of the Law, and accus'd <HI>Paul,</HI> for teaching a Defection from the Law, for forbidding Infants to be Circumciz'd, and for not living according to the <HI>Jewish</HI> Customs. <HI>Paul</HI> obey'd, and purify'd himself with his Companions, shav'd his Head, and so entring the Temple together, offer'd up an Offering for every one of them. Nay, more then this, what would be now accompted a heinous Crime, he caus'd <HI>Timothy</HI> to be Circumciz'd, being induc'd thereto by the Necessity of those times. Yet at another time he condemn'd Circumcision, if it were done with a <HI>Judaic</HI> Intention.</P>
<P>Thus an Action in it self indifferent, becomes bad or good, from the Reason and Intention of the Agent. But then, what what was to be done with the <HI>Gentiles</HI> that embrac'd the Faith of Christ, the Apostles took into their Deliberation. Never∣theless they would not oblige them to the Observation of the <HI>Mosaic</HI> Law, but only in answer to their Doubts, they com∣manded them only to abstain from those things, which might not only create in the <HI>Jews</HI> a dislike of the Gospel; but also very much scandalize those that were already Proselytes, and disturb mutual Charity and Friendship in daily Converse and Society. For the <HI>Jews</HI> would not Dyet with those who eat things <HI>Sacrific'd to Idols,</HI> or <HI>strangled,</HI> nor the <HI>blood</HI> it self. From that time some of the <HI>Judaic</HI> Rites prevail'd as indiffe∣rent among most, who did not contend against Piety and Christian Doctrine. Till at length by degrees they were either abrogated by the Church, or worn out of Use. Nor had the most ancient Institutions of the Christians any other Originals, as the <HI>Building of Churches, Plunging the whole Body in Baptism,</HI> Two <HI>Fast Dayes</HI> in a Week, Festivals and the like. However there were but few Ceremonies in the trou∣blesome times of the Church; but in the times of Peace, they increas'd to Infinity: and the worse the state of the Church
<PB N="285" REF="131"/>
was, the more Ceremonies; insomuch that St. <HI>Austin</HI> com∣plain'd in his time, <HI>That the most wholsom Precepts of Divine Books were not so much regarded, as the fictitious Comments and In∣ventions of Men upon them.</HI> The Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> by how much more opulent and powerful than the rest; so much the more sedulously and industriously it compos'd all things to Splendour and Pomp. The <HI>Roman</HI> Pontiff being the sole Judge of all things, whether convenient, or not commodi∣ous, and what he thought fit to Abrogate or Establish. But the <HI>Patriarch</HI> of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> whom the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> obey as their High Pontiff, what with the unhappy Contentions between the <HI>Melchites,</HI> and <HI>Jacobites,</HI> and the Persecutions of the <HI>Sa∣racens,</HI> has had enough to do to keep his own Station, not be∣ing at leisure in the midst of so many Storms, to think of di∣vulging new Ceremonies. Nor would the <HI>Habessines</HI> out of their wonted simplicity and plain heartedness, the best Pre∣server of ancient Custom, attempt to alter or abrogate any thing without his leave or Command. Whence it comes to pass, that many of the most ancient Customs of the Primi∣tive times, in other places out of date or abrogated, are still retain'd to this day among them. Which makes us hope that our Labour will not be ungrateful to the Reader, cu∣rious of Ecclesiastic Antiquity, if we compare the Old with the New. First, only their Churches are briefly to be de∣scrib'd, which formerly were sufficiently Magnificent, and by King <HI>Ladibela</HI> hewn out of the Bodies of the Rocks them∣selves. Some were also Built by the Succeeding Kings; but <HI>Grainus,</HI> out of his hatred to Christianity, ruin'd the greatest part of them. There are yet remaining some Footsteps of that famous Cathedral, which <HI>Helena, David</HI>'s Grandmother Built: In which there is more want of Light than of Gold or Silver. The Structure of most resembles the Ancient Architecture. For the ancient Christians, when first they had obtain'd the Opportunities of building Churches for Public Use, choosing rather to imitate the <HI>Jews,</HI> than the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> Built them in imitation of the ancient Temple of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> or of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Synagogues; nor did they give them the heathenish Names of Temples; but call'd them <HI>Ilyriacas,</HI> as it were dedicated to God, or else <HI>Oratories,</HI> or <HI>Martyria,</HI> Places of Public Testimony. Now as the Tem∣ple of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> being encompassed with a spacious Wall, consisted chiefly of three parts; that is to say, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or the
<PB N="286" REF="132"/>
<HI>wide Porch,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <HI>the body of the Temple;</HI> and lastly, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or the <HI>Holy of Holies,</HI> so the Cathedrals of the Ancients, had a Porch before the great Folding Dores surrounded with a Wall, where the <HI>Excommunicated,</HI> and <HI>Penitents,</HI> and <HI>Novices</HI> were oblig'd to tarry, till the latter more fully instructed in Christianity, were admitted to Baptism; or the former brought forth the real fruits of Amendment. Then there was the Body of the Church, in the middle of which was a <HI>secret Place,</HI> screen'd with a Curtain, which was call'd the <HI>Sacrificatory,</HI> as also the <HI>Suggestum,</HI> or place where the Pulpit stood, in Greek <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which represented the <HI>Holy of Holies.</HI> Such a <HI>Suggestum,</HI> or Place of Ascension is still to be seen in the <HI>Jewish</HI> Synagogues, and call'd in imitation of the Greek word <HI>Bimah.</HI> But this the <HI>Europeans</HI> afterward thought more convenient to remove to the farther end of the Church: we call it now the <HI>Quire,</HI> for the most part separated with Iron Lattices from the Body of the Structure. These Antique Forms of Building were accommodated to the ancient Cere∣monies. For as the <HI>Jews</HI> were admitted no farther than the Dores, and the Priests only suffer'd to pass beyond the Thre∣shold, so here none but the Baptiz'd were admitted as it were into the Bosom of the Church, the rest, like the <HI>Gen∣tiles</HI> among the <HI>Jews,</HI> prohibited from approaching nearer than the Dores. The Quire none but the Ecclesiastical Per∣sons enter'd, which was so rigidly observ'd by the An∣cients, that St. <HI>Ambrose</HI> commanded the Emperor himself <HI>Theodosius,</HI> to withdraw; whereas the Greek Church allow'd that Priviledge to their Emperors, and gave them Liberty to enter the Sanctuary when they offer'd to the Sacred Ta∣ble. After the same manner, the more famous Churches of the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> were Built; and they have also the same sort of Sanctuaries, which they call by the Hebrew Name, <HI>Heichel,</HI> at the entry whereof the Layety stand and receive the Communion. Least therefore their Nobility and their Children should be forc'd to stand among the Vulgar Croud, or they be constrain'd to break their Law and Custom, Pro∣hibiting the Layety to enter their <HI>Heichel,</HI> and participate of their Sacred Mysteries, they have found out a new Evasion, by Creating the Nobility and their Children, tho' ne're so young, or under Age, <HI>Deacons</HI> or <HI>Sub-deacons;</HI> in that only deviating from their ancient Simplicity. The King's Chil∣dren assume that Dignity of course, carrying a Cross, as a
<PB N="287" REF="132"/>
badge of their <HI>Deaconship,</HI> which they ne'r leave off when they come to the Crown. Which the <HI>Portugueses</HI> looking upon as an Ornament of <HI>Priesthood,</HI> it gave them an occasion to give the <HI>Habessine</HI> Emperor the Title of <HI>Presbyter John.</HI> There is also a little Chappel adjoyning to the Eastern part of the Church, in which the Bread and other Necessaries belonging to the Eucharist are prepar'd. Such little Chap∣pels or Rooms were Built of old near to the great Church, where the Bishops were wont to put on their Vestments: now they are small Apartments made within the Walls of the Church, call'd by the Name of Vestries. They have no Seats in their Churches, for they neither sit nor kneel, but always stand during Divine Service; according to the an∣cient Canons, which the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Russes</HI> observe to this day, as believing it more becoming the Reverence due to the Place, and more proper for Attention than to sit. The next Age providing more kindly for Infirmity, permitted sitting, least Attention should be tyr'd by weariness. But the <HI>Habes∣sines</HI> have found out a way between both; that is to say, little Crutches to lean and rest their Bodies, which when they go away, they leave in the Church Porch. If there be any who out of weakness chance to sit upon the Ground, they are in the mid'st of Prayers commanded by the Dea∣cons to rise, in these words, <HI>Eb Tarber, Tanse,</HI> You <HI>that sit, Rise.</HI> Nay, such is their Reverence to their Churches, that tho at this day they are only poor low dark Buildings, thatch'd with Straw or Reeds, yet when they approach near to any of them in their Travels, they alight from their Mules, and walk a foot till they are past them: They also put off their Shooes at the Door, and never spit upon the Pavement. No Females are admitted during their Im∣purities, nor Wives that have known their Husbands, all the day following. In this none more Rigid then the Ancients, who only admonish'd such to Abstain from the Holy Communion.</P>
<P>Pictures they admit into their Churches; but as for Sta∣tues or Sculptures Engraven or Cast, they abominate them, with the same antipathy as they do Idols. Perhaps because they never had any in the Primitive times of the Church. For it was the Saying of the Ancients, <HI>Why should Men go about to make any likeness of God, when Man himself was his Image, and no better could be made?</HI> And therefore it is a hei∣nous
<PB N="288" REF="133"/>
Offence for any one to carry about them the Picture of Christ Crucify'd. However the Clergy carry bare Crosses in their hands, which they who meet them, reverence with a Kiss; thereby Professing themselves Christians. For they often sign both themselves, and the things that belong to them, with the Sign of the Cross, after the Custom of the most ancient Christians; who were wont so to do.</P>
<P>We shall now proceed to the Sacred Ceremonies of the <HI>Habessines,</HI> beginning with the first initiation into Christia∣nity, <HI>Baptism.</HI> The Priest being to Baptize a Person or Per∣sons of full Age, which there many times happens, by reason of the frequent Conversion of the Heathen, begins with the 52 <HI>Psalm,</HI> then having Perfum'd the Persons with a Censor of Frankincense, he enquires the Names of them that are to be Baptiz'd. Then after the Recital of certain Prayers, the Deacon at the same time frequently Exhorting the Hearers to joyn with the Priest, he Anoints several parts of the Body with the Holy Oyl, and lays his Hand upon the <HI>Neophyte's</HI> Head. Which done, the <HI>Neophytes,</HI> lifting up their right Hands, and looking toward the West, abjure <HI>Satan,</HI> as the Prince of Darkness. Then turning to the East, as to the Sun of Justice, and lifting up again their Right hands, they make as it were a kind of Vow to Christ; which don, they say over the Creed after the Priest, who putting the Question, They answer, <HI>They do Believe.</HI> Which ended, the Parties again are anointed, and some certain pieces of Chapters are read out of the Gospel of St. <HI>John,</HI> the Acts of the Apostles, and the Epistles of St. <HI>Paul.</HI> At length the Oyl is so pour'd into the Water prepar'd for the Baptism, as to resemble in falling the Signature of the Cross, and after the Rehearsal of several other Prayers, the Priest descends into a certain Pool, made on pur∣pose before the Doors of the Church, whither the Persons being conducted by the Deacon, the Priest takes them, and plunges them three times over Head and Ears, saying, <HI>I Baptize thee in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</HI> At the same time the Men have Men, the Women Women to assist them, who lending their Hands and Arms to their Friends, support them in going out of the Pool, and were therefore call'd <HI>Susceptores</HI> or <HI>Upholders</HI> by the Ancients. Be∣ing thus wash'd, and once more anointed, they are first
<PB N="289" REF="133"/>
clad with a White Under-garment, to signifie the Purity of the Mind; and over that, with a Red Vestment, in token of their Salvation purchas'd by the Blood of Christ; and so introduc'd into the Church, where, being intermixed with Christians, they are made Partakers of the Holy Commu∣nion. At their departure they are presented with Milk and Honey, and so the Priest laying his Hand upon their Heads, dismisses them with this Benediction, <HI>Sons of Baptism, go in Peace.</HI> For the <HI>Habessines</HI> frequently call the Christians <HI>Velda Temqet, Sons of Baptism.</HI> All which Circumstances are agree∣able to the Rites of the Ancients. <HI>Let us thrice be plung'd,</HI> saith <HI>Tertullian, and thence supported, let us tast the Society of Milk and Honey.</HI> These are the Ceremonies observ'd toward those of ripe years.</P>
<P>The Ceremonies of Baptizing Infants are much shorter. Males were formerly never Baptiz'd before the Fortieth day, Females before the Eightieth day, unless upon imminent danger of Death. But now they hasten Baptism much sooner, especially if the Infant be weak and sickly. The Godfathers and Godmothers make answer to the Priest in their behalf. Nor are they plung'd in the Water, but only Sprinkl'd and Dipp'd, and that at the Entrance only of the Church; there being no admittance for them into the Church before Baptism. Lastly, Because the Holy Com∣munion is given to those of riper years presently after Bap∣tism, therefore least Infants should be in a worse Condition, in former times they dropt two or three drops out of the Sa∣cred Cup, having crumbl'd a little piece of the Holy Bread into it before: to shew there was the same regard to be had to them, as to those of riper Age. Which being long observ'd in the Latin Church, the <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> together with the <HI>Armenians,</HI> observe the Custom to this day. <HI>Gregory</HI> told me, That they did no more than only dip the top of one of their Fingers in the Wine, and moisten the Childs tongue. Now that they use the same form of words with us, <HI>Alvarez</HI> is Positive, that is to say, <HI>I Baptize thee in the Name of the Fa∣ther, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</HI> Nor could I apprehend any otherwise out of their own Liturgies.</P>
<P>Which makes it more to be admir'd, what the Fathers of the Society, making no mention at all of this Form, have written into <HI>Europe,</HI> That several partly unwonted, partly frivolous Forms, and quite altering the Essence of Baptism,
<PB N="290" REF="134"/>
were made use of by the <HI>Habessine</HI> Clergy: For Example, <HI>I Baptize thee in the Name of the most Holy Trinity; I Baptize thee in the Name of Christ; I Baptize thee in the Name of the Holy Ghost</HI> only; <HI>I Baptize thee in the Water of</HI> Jordan; <HI>The Lord baptize thee; Let God wash thee; Let Baptism wash thee; Blessed be the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,</HI> with seve∣ral others of the same Nature. For which reason they were constrain'd to Rebaptize many People, not permitted by the Catholic Church, but upon extraordinary occasions. So that at length they promiscuously Rebaptiz'd all the <HI>Habessinians,</HI> tho with this Condition, That the first Baptism was not rightly perform'd, which drew upon them the Ha∣tred and Envy of the <HI>Habessinian</HI> Clergy.</P>
<P>Many Writers have believ'd, and reported, That the <HI>Ethi∣opians</HI> were branded with a Mark after Baptism, in order to the fulfilling the words of <HI>St. John, He that cometh after me shall Baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.</HI> But <HI>Gregory</HI> himself deny'd any such Custom, nor do the Fathers of the Society make any mention of it in their Writings. But this is certain, that the People of <HI>Africa,</HI> as well <HI>Gentils,</HI> as <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> do cauterize the Temple-Veins of Children newly Born, to preserve them from <HI>Catarrhs.</HI> Which being perhaps done by some of the <HI>Habessines</HI> to the same end, was by some ignorant Foreigners taken for a Religious Ce∣remony. As having heard that formerly there were a sort of silly Heretics, who misinterpreting the word <HI>Fire,</HI> pro∣perly so taken, and wresting it to the Improper significa∣tion of Baptism, preferr'd the Caustic Signature of Fire, be∣fore the Ceremony of washing in Water.</P>
<P>But now for what concerns their <HI>Anniversary</HI> Baptism, with which the <HI>Abessines</HI> are so much reproach'd, we are to give this Light. Upon the XI. of <HI>January,</HI> which with us is upon the Sixth, in the mid'st of their Summer, and the Feast of the Epiphany, they keep a most joyful Festival in Commemoration of the Baptism of our Saviour, which with many of the Ancients, they certainly believe, was per∣form'd upon that day. By the first Dawn of the Morning Light, the Clergy begin the Solemnity with certain loud and chearful Hymns. The King with all the Nobility of the Court, the Metropolitan with the Clergy, Nobles and Plebeians, Old and Young, before Sun-rise, throng into the Rivers and Ponds, and there delight themselves in the Wa∣ter,
<PB N="291" REF="134"/>
plunging and diving over Head and Ears. As they meet any of the Priests, they crave a Blessing from them, who return them generally their desires in these words, <HI>God bless thee;</HI> or, <HI>God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost bless thee.</HI> Hence it was that many believ'd that the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> renew'd their Baptism every year. But as excess of Joy fre∣quently begets wantonness; so is it frequent for the Young men upon this day to leap, and dance, and swim and duck one another; and by and by to fill the neighbouring Fields with Hoopings and Hallowings, the usual Consequences of such kind of Sports. So that they make of it rather a day of Jollity, than a Pious Christian Festival. All this I relate from <HI>Gregorie</HI>'s own Lips. The Relation of <HI>Alvarez</HI> is quite different, as if it were a real Baptism, and that the Men and Women were at that time promiscuously rebaptiz'd. Whe∣ther they did so, or whether <HI>Alvarez</HI> rightly understood the words of the Baptizer, I very much question. And yet I cannot but very much wonder at what <HI>Tellez</HI> reports, That at other times, and for slight causes, both Men and Women cause themselves to be rebaptized, and that after a most indecent manner. For should such a thing have been customary, King <HI>Basilides</HI> would never have upbraided the Fathers with their reiteration of Baptism, so frequently as he did. For my part, I never read or heard of any such thing. However, if any such thing were ever practis'd, it is to be attributed rather to the stupid ignorance of the Priests, then to allow'd Custom.</P>
<P>For in the last Century such was the most miserable Condition of the Ecclesiastical Affairs in <HI>Habessinia,</HI> that nothing could be more deplorable: at what time, by rea∣son of the continual Invasions and Irruptions of the <HI>Gallans</HI> and <HI>Adelans,</HI> the People were dispierc'd and scatter'd up and down the Mountains and Rocks, like a Flock without a Shepheard, without Law, and almost without either King or Metropolitan; all Sacred Worship ceas'd; their Clergy were dissipated, and their Temples and Monasteries every where ruin'd and burnt. What wonder then that <HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>Sloth</HI> should grow upon them? and that the illiterate Priests, for want of Books, not to be supply'd by Printing, and through the scarcity of Learned Men, should rashly ob∣trude many things altogether Foreign from the Rites of their Ancestors. For such Accidents frequently happen in great
<PB N="292" REF="135"/>
Calamities, when Bishops and Princes cannot perform, or else grow careless of their Offices; when little regarding their own Eternal Salvation, they leave that to fate, or the pleasure of every private Person, which should be their chief and principal care. Such was the Sluggishness that overwhelm'd all <HI>Greece,</HI> in the time of <HI>Maurice</HI> the Empe∣ror; so that neither <HI>Gregory</HI> understood Greek, nor any one at <HI>Constantinople</HI> could understand Latin, such was the misery of that Age, in the Latin Church, as <HI>Baronius</HI> testifies, when nothing but meer Barbarism and Ignorance Triumph'd, when all Arts and Vertuous Studies were Exil'd, and only Vice prevail'd in Church and State. At that time there was a certain Priest, who neither like a Latinist, nor a Christian, had Baptiz'd several Infants in <HI>Nomine Patria, &amp; Filia, &amp; Spi∣ritual Sancta,</HI> which Baptism was however confirm'd by <HI>Za∣charias</HI> the Pope, by reason of the good intention of the <HI>Baptizer.</HI></P>
<P>That Sinners after Baptism are reconcil'd to God and the Church, they make no Question: However they teach that there must be a Repentance for these Sins, and that Re∣pentance to be made known by Confession. But to enume∣rate all and singular their particular Sins, with all their cir∣cumstances, they think it neither commanded of God, nor at all necessary. And therefore, they only say in general words to the Priest, <HI>Absan, Absan, we have Sinn'd, we have Sinn'd.</HI> So that when the <HI>Roman</HI> Priests press'd them to par∣ticular Confession, they never acknowledg'd any more than three, if they had been guilty, <HI>Homicide, Adultery,</HI> and <HI>Theft.</HI> To confess any more they could not be induc'd without great difficulty. The Offender is Absolv'd in very few words, together with some gentle stripes upon the Side with an Olive twigg, which is thought sufficient to de∣liver him from the Power of <HI>Satan.</HI> But as for them that have committed any of those great Crimes before-named, they are not only chastiz'd with severe Reprehension and bitter Language, but many times also severely Scourg'd, to the end they may not only hear, but be sensible of their Ab∣solution. <HI>Tellez</HI> reports, That the Metropolitan some∣times hears Confessions himself; and that when he un∣derstands the heinousness of the Crime, he rises up, and after a sharp rebuke of the Penitent, he cryes out, <HI>Hast thou done this? Dost thou not fear God? Go too, let him be Scourg'd
<PB N="293" REF="135"/>
thirty or forty times.</HI> Presently the Executioners are ready, who streight prepare their Scourges, and give the misera∣ble Sinner six or seven cutting lashes; the rest being remit∣ted at the Intercession of the Standers by. There was one who to avoid so sharp an Absolution of his Crime, re∣quested of the Metropolitan sitting in his Seat of Judicature, that he might make his Confession in Private; to whom the Metropolitan, <HI>How! Shall not thy Sin be made manifest at the last day, before all the World?</HI> Tell therefore, <HI>what it is?</HI> The unfortunate Offender believing it his duty to obey, openly confess'd, it was the <HI>stealing of Oxen.</HI> By chance the Owner of the Oxen was there; who being glad that he had appre∣hended the Thief, presently accus'd him, so that the poor Fel∣low being Convicted of the Fact by his own Confession before so many Witnesses, was constrain'd to restore the Oxen, and undergo a severe Punishment beside.</P>
<P>But as the <HI>Habessines</HI> are generally of a soft and mild Dis∣position, for the most part, so soon as they have committed any notable Offence, they presently run to their Confessors, and confessing they have sinn'd, desire to receive the Com∣munion for the quiet of their Consciences. But this they do not do, till they come to be at least Five and twenty years of Age. For till then they prolong their years of Indiscretion, pretending Childish Innocence. So that if a Young man die before he be Twenty years old, they bewail him in these words, <HI>Oh! let my Soul be like the Soul of this Innocent.</HI> So great a Confidence they have in the honest Inclinations of their Youth.</P>
<P>The whole Divine Service of the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> is compleated by the sole Administration of the Sacrament, and reading some few broken parcels of Chapters out of the New Te∣stament: for they neither make use of Sacred Hymns nor of Preaching. Which when we seem'd to wonder at, <HI>Gre∣gory</HI> ask'd me, <HI>Whether we thought our Preachers could speak any thing better then what was written in the Sacred Scripture, or the Homilies of the Fathers of the Primitive Church? Whe∣ther we thought their Sayings more efficacious than the Word of God? Whether we did not fear, lest those Preachers should utter something which might be repugnant to our Faith and Salvation, which might prove of dangerous Consequence, especially among the Plebeian and rustic sort of People?</HI> We answer'd, That the Worship of God requir'd it; and that the use and end of
<PB N="294" REF="136"/>
Preaching was at large set forth in Scripture; to the end we might understand the benefit of them. But the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> to supply this defect, have Compos'd several Li∣turgies and Homilies, of which mention has been already made. To these they add several Portions of Scripture usually appointed to be read, which are fourfold, out of the Evangelists, the Acts, the Epistles of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and the rest of the Canonical Epistles; to which they give the Titles of <HI>Wengel,</HI> the <HI>Evangils, Gheber,</HI> the <HI>Acts, Paulus,</HI> and <HI>Hawarja</HI> the Apostle. But in the general Liturgy, which they call <HI>Canon Kedasi,</HI> the <HI>Canon of the Mass,</HI> there are all their Cere∣monies to be found, with all their Prayers accustom'd to be apply'd to the several Varieties of Duties to be perform'd; all their Instruments and Vessels being sanctify'd by certain Prayers and Ejaculations. For in the Sanctuary stands the <HI>Holy Table,</HI> which they call <HI>Kedesat Terphez,</HI> vulgarly <HI>Manbar.</HI> It differs from their Common Tables, for that you may go round about it, and place what you please upon it. Only it is cover'd with a Canopy, sustain'd with four Pillars at each Corner. Upon this they place the Sacred Vessels. First the <HI>Tabot,</HI> or <HI>Chest:</HI> A little Table so call'd; but the reason why, I never yet could find; for that it has no re∣semblance of a Chest; it being an Oblong Quadrangular Table, upon which the Dish and the Cup are set; and therefore I must repair to conjecture, which I shall willingly submit to the Judgment of the Learned.</P>
<P>The most ancient Christians, when for almost three Ages together, they could not have the Opportunity of Admini∣string or receiving the Communion in Public, were con∣strain'd to take their Opportunities in Dens and Caves; but for the most part in the Church-yards, in the silence of the Night. To which purpose, they either carry'd the Bread, Wine, Cup, and other Utensils wrapp'd up in Linnen, or otherwise conceal'd to the place where the Congregation met. Whence it seems very probable to me, that they might make use of the Coffins themselves, or some Chest in the fashion of a Bier, to conveigh their Sacred Utensils, under the pretence of carrying forth their Dead. Which Chest being thus conveigh'd into the Church-yard or Cave where they met, serv'd also instead of a Table, about which the Communicants sate, and receiv'd in their Order. If they found any Bones of the Holy Martyrs scatter'd about,
<PB N="295" REF="136"/>
they gather'd them up, and put them up in this Chest, which Custom in after Ages became a Law. If they were driven from their Habitations, or constrain'd for fear of Tyrannical fury to seek new abodes, this Chest was still carry'd from place to place, where the Bishop or Presbyter resided, who was to perform the Sacred Duty. And thus they came to be call'd either Chests by their proper Names, or Tables in reference to their Use, the Name of Altar growing out of Mind. For so <HI>Minutius Felix; D'ye think,</HI> says he, <HI>that we conceal the Deity whom we serve, because we have not Temples and Altars,</HI> properly so call'd? Afterwards they began in respect of the Oblations to be call'd Altars. But in process of Time, when the Sacrament came to be Admi∣nister'd without controul, there happen'd a great Change. For that some thought it not lawful to perform the Sacred Duty, otherwhere then at those wooden Chests, which long Custom had now made <HI>Religious.</HI> And therefore being brought forth of the Caves where they had been Consecra∣ted, they were set apart for the Administration of the Eu∣charist; and it is not unlikely, that in regard they were to be plac'd upon low Tables, they were made the more plain, and the lesser, that they might be more fit for use; till at length they came to be made like the Tables themselves; so that now the form being chang'd, the name only ap∣pears among the <HI>Ethiopians.</HI> But after that, when Christians began to rear great and stately Fabricks, those Arks or Chests together with the Tables, were plac'd in the Sanctuary; and in most Churches the Name of <HI>Table</HI> remain'd; but in Latin Church the Name of <HI>Altar,</HI> as the more worthy and decent Appellation prevail'd.</P>
<P>But this was an establish'd Custom among the Ancients, That the Basis upon which the Sacred Vessels were to be set, should be first consecrated. Whence it came to pass, that the <HI>Tables</HI> or <HI>Altars</HI> themselves were consecra∣ted; and so the use of those Arks or Chests ceas'd. But where there were no Altars, or that the question was, whe∣ther they were consecrated or no, there the Greeks had their <HI>Antimensae,</HI> or little Crickets; the Latins, their <HI>Portalia</HI> or small Portative Tables, which they set upon those Altars that were not consecrated. But for the <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> they make use of their Chest and their Table both together; to the end the Service may be the more fully and absolutely
<PB N="296" REF="137"/>
perform'd, and nothing left undon. Now in regard these Chests were formerly made of Wood, it was not material what sort of Wood. But after the Popes had commanded that the Altars should be made of <HI>Parget,</HI> the little Porta∣tive Altar was also made of the same matter, for that reason call'd <HI>Lapis Sacratus,</HI> or the <HI>Consecrated Stone.</HI> The little Chest which the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> use, is generally of Wood, though they do not Prohibit those that are made of Stone, or cast Metal. However the Fathers of the Society would not permit them to make use of any but of Stone; the rest they either burnt or melted down.</P>
<P>Now the better to support and give credit to Conjecture, and to shew that the Primitive Christians had besides their plain and fix'd Tables, real Chests, like Chests of Drawers, we shall produce a Marble Monument digg'd up in one of the Christian Church-yards. Which, if you observe it, is like a Trunk or arched <HI>Bier,</HI> cover'd with a Linnen Cloth in folds, not a Half-Moon Table like a C. as <HI>Aringhus</HI> ima∣gin'd. Neither am I apt to believe that they who sate about it were celebrating their <HI>Love Feasts,</HI> but the Holy Commu∣nion. Which is plain from the Sacred Loaves that are there represented, sign'd with a <HI>Saltir Cross,</HI> which the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> still use in the Holy Communion. <HI>Thuanus,</HI> it seems, saw one of those sort of Altars, when he came to <HI>Aux</HI> in the Province of <HI>Armagnac,</HI> and describes them to be like certain Chests. <HI>Here,</HI> says he, <HI>we view'd the Temple of St.</HI> Orentius, <HI>of most re∣mote Antiquity, where we beheld several Altars plac'd up and down in the Temple, being the Coffins of the Martyrs, round about which the Christians formerly held their Meetings; not plain and level like our Tables, but rising with a kind of Gibbosity, in the manner of a Trunk lidd: which were marked with two Greek Letters, (χ.χ.) represent∣ing the Name of Christ.</HI> With <HI>Thuanus</HI> agrees <HI>Gabriel Biel,</HI> who discoursing of Wooden Altars, <HI>Nor is it contradictory,</HI> says he, <HI>to what has bin said before, that there is a wooden Altar in the Lateran Church, which Altar is preserv'd out of a par∣ticular Reverence to the Prince of Apostles, and the preceding Holy Martyrs, who were said to have Celebrated the Holy Commu∣nion upon that Altar. This Altar was fix'd by Bishop</HI> Silvester, <HI>to the end that no Person, unless the Pope himself should presume to make use of it, for the Celebration of Divine Service. But the rage of Persecution continuing from the time that the Prince of the Apo∣stles was Bishop, till the Pontificate of</HI> Silvester, <HI>there was no</HI>

<HI>fix'd Episcopal See, So that they were forc'd to perform holy Duties either in Caves or other private places upon a wooden Altar, in the form of a hollow Chest, which was carry'd about by the Priests, where∣ever the</HI> Roman <HI>Bishop kept his secret Habitation.</HI> Which is confirm'd by <HI>Father Tellez,</HI> who thus writes, where he Discourses concerning the <HI>Chest</HI> made use of by the <HI>Ethio∣pians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Moreover 'tis well known, that in the Infancy of the Catholic Church, the Altars were of Wood, like little Chests, and there were no other Altars of Stone, till the time that</HI> Silvester <HI>began to Conse∣crate Altars of kind. However he left remaining in the Cathedral of St.</HI> Peters, <HI>others say in St.</HI> John Laterano, <HI>a little wooden Chest, which for so many years had bin the Altar which so many Pious Popes had made use of, and upon which it is not law∣ful at this day for any Person but the Pope himself to Ce∣lebrate.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Studious Reader may perceive frequent men∣tion to have bin made of these <HI>Chests;</HI> and if the <HI>little Chest</HI> of which <HI>Tellez</HI> has given us a Relation, be still Extant at <HI>Rome,</HI> there can be no room left for any farther doubt concerning the Matter or the Form: and our Conjecture concerning their Original will stand good, till the Learned shall give us better Information. Now, that the <HI>Martyrs</HI> Bones were anciently put into these <HI>Chests,</HI> we gather from the <HI>Council of Carthage,</HI> which approves and confirms the Custom. For so runs the 14 Canon of the <HI>Fifth</HI> by Name, but <HI>Third</HI> in Order of Time. The Altars, <HI>In which</HI> (he doth not say <HI>above,</HI> nor <HI>under) there are no Reliques of Martyrs, shall be remov'd.</HI> Neither could those Bones be dispos'd of in Tables, nor in the Altars, so call'd, of the Ancients. And in this we have bin the more prolix, to the end the Original and Use of the <HI>Ethiopic Chest,</HI> appropriated to the Communion, might be the better understood.</P>
<P>The other holy Vessels are <HI>Pahal,</HI> the <HI>Dish, Tzevae,</HI> the <HI>Cup,</HI> and Spoon for distribution of the Wine, call'd <HI>Eref Mas∣kel,</HI> the <HI>Spoon of the Cross;</HI> by reason that the handle ends in a little Cross. Besides these, they have their consecrated <HI>Urns</HI> and <HI>Censors,</HI> in regard they frequently fume with Frankin∣cense, which Necessity constrain'd them to do while they were forc'd to make use of Caves and Subterraneal Places.</P>
<P>In the Administration of the Sacrament, they use a sort of leaven'd Bread (as was done in the Latin Church for many
<PB N="298" REF="139"/>
Ages) Mark'd with a Cross ✚, imprinted into the Mass of the Loaf. This Bread they call <HI>Korban,</HI> and Bake it new every day, admiring at the Latins for keeping their Holy Bread till the Morrow. But upon the Fifth Holy-day of the great Week, in Memory of Christ's unleaven'd Loaves, they also use unleaven'd Bread; pieces of which the Priest distributes to the Communicants. For they all participate of one Loaf. The Wine is by the <HI>Deacon</HI> given out of the Cup in a Spoon indifferently to all, as well Layety, as Cler∣gy. True it is, they want real Wine; the defect of which they supply by steeping the bruis'd Stones of <HI>Raisins</HI> in Water, and then squeezing and straining the Infusion, which makes a kind of <HI>Raisin</HI> Liquor. Yet not believing it thus made to be small enough, the <HI>Subdeacon</HI> pours a Spoonful or two of Water into the hollow of the Communicants hand, with which he first washes his mouth, and after that, sups it up. <HI>Tellez</HI> will not allow this Liquor to be other then meer Wa∣ter; and for that reason laughs at the <HI>Habessines,</HI> for believ∣ing they Communicate in both kinds, when they Commu∣nicate in neither; tho the Fathers of the Society, for want of Wine, were forc'd to use the same Liquor in the former Age. Which <HI>Sandovall</HI> calls a Holy and Provident In∣vention. Most certain it is that many Countreys, especially inhabited by barbarous People, and remote from the Sea, are destitute of Wine; as the <HI>Copts</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and the Christians of the Order of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> in <HI>India.</HI> Nay, some there were, who were put to harder shifts than all this: having no other way but to dip a linnen Cloth in Wine, when they could come at it, and dry it again. This Cloath they kept very charily, and when they had an occasion to Administer the Sacrament, they moisten'd a part of the Cloath in water, and wrung the moisture out again with their hands. Which wa∣ter so relish'd and tinctur'd, they gave to the People.</P>
<P>These Shifts Pope <HI>Julius</HI> condemns, however in a case of Necessity, he permits the cluster it self to be squeez'd into the Cup, and the Liquor to be mix'd with water.</P>
<P>The time of receiving the Sacrament, is left to every man's liberty; some receive every Week, some every Month; but always within the Church. For they hold it a great Sin to carry the Holy Mysteries out of the Church into private Houses: Neither does the King, nor the Metropolitan assume to themselves that Priviledge. They never spit,
<PB N="299" REF="139"/>
that day they have receiv'd. They also receive Fasting, and toward the Evening too, if it be a fasting day.</P>
<P>But now to Administer the Sacrament in large and crowd∣ed Churches, and upon Solemn days, it requires four or five Men at least. <HI>Bahen,</HI> the <HI>Priest;</HI> or <HI>Kasis,</HI> the <HI>Presbyter. Nefek Kasis,</HI> the <HI>Sub-Presbyter; Daj-kan,</HI> the <HI>Deacon;</HI> and <HI>Nefeh Dajkan,</HI> the <HI>Sub-Deacon.</HI> There are also present other Assistants, to hold the Candles, and to attend upon the Priests. These every one taking his particular part, per∣form the whole Duty, reading of several Prayers, as the va∣riety of Action, and the use of distinct Vessels require. Lastly, they recommend both the <HI>Living</HI> and the <HI>Dead</HI> to God, which they call <HI>receiving the Dapdukon,</HI> the <HI>Diptych,</HI> or <HI>Church Register;</HI> which among the Ancient Greeks, consisted of two Tables, wherein the Name of those were written, who were to be Pray'd for in the Register. There are some that bring their Offerings to the Holy Table, as Bread, Oyl, Tithes, first Fruits, and the like; which at the Conclusion of the Sacrament, are distributed to the Poor. Which I take to be understood of that ancient Custom mention'd by <HI>Clau∣dius,</HI> in his <HI>Confession of Faith. Vangaber Bat Mesah, that day,</HI> meaning the Sabbath, we make a Charitable Feast. These Holydaies they keep two days every Week; that is to say, upon the Sabaoth and the Lord's-Day. That they call <HI>San∣bat Ejehude,</HI> which they say they celebrate in commemora∣tion of the professed Creation, and therefore they do not keep it so solemnly as the Lord's-Day. But upon the Lord's-Day, which they call <HI>Sanbat Ehad,</HI> or the Sabbath of the first Holyday; or <HI>Ehude,</HI> the <HI>first Holyday,</HI> singly, or <HI>Sanbat Chri∣stejan,</HI> the Christians Sabbath, they keep after the custom of the Catholic Church, and read over all the Offices and Ser∣vices requir'd.</P>
<P>They have no Bells of Brass, or mix'd Metal like ours; in∣stead of which, they only use a kind of hollow Vessels resembling Bells, made of Iron, Stone, or Wood, more for Noise, than delightful to the Ear. Neither is their Church Music any thing more pleasing. For besides that, the Voices of their Singing Priests, whom they call <HI>Dabetra,</HI> are very harsh and ungrateful, the Instruments they make use of after the <HI>Egyptian</HI> manner, such as Cimbals, Morrice Bells, and Kettle Drums, which the Grandees themselves think no dishonour to rattle upon those Solemnities, are no
<PB N="300" REF="140"/>
way agreeable to the Harmony of <HI>Europe.</HI> With their Music they use Skipping and Dancing, in imitation of <HI>David</HI> Dancing before the Ark of the Covenant. At what time they make the Floor ring again after such a rude manner, that you would believe them rather at a Wedding, than at a Christian Solemni∣ty. This they call <HI>exulting, rejoycing,</HI> and <HI>clapping hands to the God of</HI> Jacob, as they are commanded in the Psalms; and this they call Praising God upon the Harp and Organ, and with <HI>Cymbals,</HI> tho it cannot be said they are so sweet sounding as those in <HI>David</HI>'s Time may be imagin'd to be. Which things tho they seem to us, not to correspond with the gra∣vity of Christian Worship, yet will not they much admire, who well know, that in some places among the Latins, the Feast of the Body of God was solemniz'd with Dancing; which as it could not be done without Music, there were others that play'd in disguise before the Dancers upon Harps.</P>
<P>Fasting days are no where more exactly observ'd. Not that they abstain from some Meats, and gluttonize upon others. For that they look upon as a mockery of Fasting. For they keep themselves whole dayes without either Food or Drink, even till Sunset of the third Evening. Others there are that abstain the two Holydaies of the Passion Week. The Monks put themselves upon greater Extremities than all this; by which means they not only mortifie but destroy. Besides all which they fast twice in seven days, upon the Fourth and Sixth Holyday, like the rest of the Eastern Churches. The reason of which was by <HI>Tzagazaab</HI> said to be, for that the Fourth day the Murther of Christ was concluded upon, and the Sixth it was executed; according to what many of the Ancients taught. But we believe that these two Fasting-days, as many other things, were admitted and observ'd in imi∣tation of the <HI>Jews</HI> by the Primitive Christians, who were ei∣ther <HI>Jews,</HI> or else had learn't from the <HI>Jews,</HI> that this Custom was introduc'd and us'd as a Duty both Pious and Necessary for these times. For the <HI>Jews</HI> fasted twice in a Week; which is that which the Pharisee boasted, <HI>I fast twice upon the Sab∣bath,</HI> that is within the two days in seven, <HI>viz.</HI> upon the Se∣cond and Fifth Holyday; which the Christians, because they would not fast upon the same day with the <HI>Jews,</HI> alter'd for the Fourth and Sixth. Afterwards <HI>Innocent,</HI> and <HI>Gregory</HI> the Seventh, abrogating the Fast of the Fourth Holyday, im∣pos'd
<PB N="301" REF="140"/>
Abstinence from Flesh upon <HI>Sunday,</HI> not minding the ancient Canon, <HI>If any Clergy-man shall be known to Fast upon any Sabbath or Lord's-Day, one excepted, let him be suspended from his Office.</HI></P>
<P>That one Sabbath is <HI>Easter Eve.</HI> Otherwise to fast upon the Lord's-Day, the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> account it Criminal, like the ancient Christians; as <HI>Tertullian</HI> witnesses. Besides these, and other Fasts of the Eastern Church, they observe in the first place, the Forty days <HI>Lent,</HI> which they make up Fifty. For it begins Ten days before the Roman <HI>Lent;</HI> That is, upon the second Holyday after <HI>Sexagesima Sunday.</HI> And this as a Command of God, they observe both healthy and sick Peo∣ple, most exactly and religiously; only as we said before, upon <HI>Sundays</HI> they eat Flesh. After <HI>Easter,</HI> they supply the pinching hardship and sobriety of the past Weeks with the Jollity and Mirth of those that succeed. For during all the time of <HI>Pentecost,</HI> so formerly was the interval of the Fifty days call'd, (from the Feast of the Resurrection till the Feast of tending the Holy Gost) they spend their time in all manner of Feasting and Jocundry, suitable to the Country. All that time, as of old with the Latins, so among the <HI>Ethi∣opians,</HI> being still observ'd as one continu'd Festival. <HI>Gregory</HI> considering these things, and admiring that the Protestants in <HI>Germany</HI> observ'd no other Fasts, but what were command∣ed by their Princes in case of Public Calamity, was an∣swer'd out of St. <HI>Ambrose; we do not Fast because the Lord abi∣deth with us, not only those Fifty days, but all the year long, nay as long as we live.</HI> Thus Christ answer'd them, who objected to his Disciples.</P>
<P><HI>Can the Sons of the Bridegroom mourn while the Bridegroom is among them. But the time shall come, that the Bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they shall fast.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore the ancient Christians, when those days came that Christ had foretold, that is to say, the days of Persecu∣tion and Affliction, did well and truly in that they frequent∣ly fasted. But we, in regard our Bridegroom is return'd with his favour and his Grace, and has restor'd Peace and Tran∣quillity to his Church, have no need to observe set Fasts as necessary; but to say with St. <HI>Ambrose, That true Fasting is an alienation from Incontinency of Language, Suppression of wrath and ill Desires, and Abstinence from Slander and Reproach.</HI> And with St. <HI>Austin, The Great and General Fasting is to abstain
<PB N="302" REF="141"/>
from Iniquity, and the unlawful Pleasures of the Age, which is per∣fect Fasting.</HI></P>
<P>Besides the Sabbath and Lord's-Day, they observe all the chief and ancient Festivals of the Catholic Church; The <HI>Annunciation, Nativity, Circumcision, Baptism, Passion, Resur∣rection, Ascension,</HI> and the <HI>Descension</HI> of the Holy Ghost, call'd <HI>Bagnab Arbgna,</HI> or the Feast of Forty days; as also that most ancient Festival of the Primitive Church call'd <HI>Rakeb,</HI> in the Middle of the Pentecost, by the Latins call'd <HI>Cantate,</HI> at what time the Bishops are commanded to assemble a Synod, by the Canons commonly call'd <HI>Apostolical.</HI> As for the other Festivals, which were introduc'd by the <HI>Kopts, Greeks</HI> or <HI>Latins,</HI> after the Variances of the Council of <HI>Chalcedon,</HI> some they admit, some they receive, according as they think most agreeable to their Religion.</P>
<P>They begin in the year from the Calends of <HI>September,</HI> with the <HI>Greeks, Armenians, Russians,</HI> and other Oriental Christians. For they believe that the World was created at the time of the Autumnal Equinoctial. They farther also compute Five thousand and five hundred years to the <HI>Nativi∣ty,</HI> Eight years less than the Greeks, and they who follow the Translation of the <HI>Seventy Interpreters,</HI> from whence that Computation was made. The Supputation of the Christians is the same, which <HI>Scaliger</HI> says was therefore don, because the Christians believe the World to be less ancient by Eight years then the Greeks do, but he does not apply his reason home. We are apt to believe it came to pass through some erroneous Substraction of the years of the World. For that finding perhaps that the Greeks, to perfect the Calculation of the Years of Christ, had substracted 5508 years of the World; they also did the same, forgetting that those Eight years were already wanting; or else having settl'd the years of Christ, according to the Greek Computation, and coming afterwards to reform the Age of the World, they found these Eight years to be over and above. However it fall out, let any one year of Christ be granted by them, Eight years must be added to their Computation, if you desire to know the agreeing time of any certain Transaction.</P>
<P>Their year consists of Twelve Months, as among us; But each Month, as among the <HI>Egyptians</HI> having but Thirty days; therefore to supply the <HI>Solar</HI> Year, to every Three years they add Five days, to every Four years Six days; which by
<PB N="303" REF="141"/>
a word borrow'd from the Greek they call <HI>Pagomen.</HI> Hence it happens, that their Feasts go according to the <HI>Julian</HI> Ac∣compt, and fall upon the same days; yet are otherwise number'd. For the Feast of the Nativity of Christ is cele∣brated the same day with us, which happens among the <HI>Eu∣ropeans</HI> using the <HI>Julian</HI> Accompt, to be upon the 25 of <HI>De∣cember,</HI> but with them falls upon the 28 of <HI>December.</HI> Nei∣ther did the Catholic Church in any part of the World ever observe it upon any other days; So that it is to be admir'd that <HI>Scaliger</HI> should go about to Translate it into Autumn. It is farther observable, that to the space of Four years they give the Denomination of one of the Evangelists; it being the Custom to finish the reading of one Evange∣list quite through in that time. Which is the reason that in some of their Chronological Computations, you shall find added, <HI>in the days of</HI> Mark, <HI>in the days of</HI> John <HI>the Evan∣gelist,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>As to what concerns their Nuptial Rites, most certain it is, that <HI>Polygamy</HI> is not allow'd by the <HI>Habessine</HI> Church, however it be tolerated by the Civil Magistrate. For they that Marry more than one are not punish'd by the Magistrates; yet they are prohibited from the Holy Sacrament: as be∣ing of those sort of People, that do no injury to the Com∣mon-wealth, but only contradict the Rules of Christian Sanctity; as if it were not the Office or Duty of Kings and Princes, but of the Bishops of the Church to make Men God∣ly and Christianly vertuous. This <HI>Alvarez</HI> asserts upon his own Knowledge: Whose Host at <HI>Dobarra</HI> had Three Wives which had brought him Seven and thirty Children; for which there was no other notice taken of him, but only that he was not admitted to the Church, or to the Com∣munion, until he at last put Two of them away. Here it may not be improper to inquire how the Metropolitan be∣haves himself toward their Kings, who have more Wives than one. For the <HI>Habessinian</HI> Kings, by vertue of an old Ill custom, besides several Wives lawfully Marry'd, are not asham'd to keep several Concubines; as if they did it in imitation of <HI>Solomon,</HI> from whom they boast their Descent. True it is, That the Fathers of the Society would not grant Absolution to <HI>Susneus,</HI> before he had dismiss'd all his Super∣numerary Wives, retaining only the first. Indeed it is to me no small wonder, that the Laws of the Church, and the
<PB N="304" REF="142"/>
Kingdom should no better agree; that the one should be so loose in point of Marriages, the other so strict; especially where the dispute arises, not so much as to the Matter, as to the Name. Thus we find the Marriages of Kindred for∣bidden, even to distant degrees; for that the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> want∣ing terms of distinction, call one another all by the Names of Brothers and Sisters. Thus a Church-man may not Mar∣ry his Brother's Wife, but a Lay Person may. However no Marriages but those that are approv'd by Divine Autho∣rity, are honour'd with Sacerdotal Benediction; nor those neither publickly in the Church, unless they be such Clergy∣men, to whom the <HI>Hallelujah</HI> is Sung. Other People are Marry'd either at home, or before the Dores of the Church. However all Secular Persons have also this Priviledge, that they can throw off the Yoke when they please. For upon any slight Difference between a Man and his Wife, if they cannot be reconcil'd, the King's Judges presently dissolve the Marriage. But as for the Clergy, if it be their desire to put away their Wives, or to Marry another, the first being Deceas'd, they are oblig'd to renounce their Function. Where∣by it happens, that their Marriages are much more peaceful, and more durable.</P>
<P>To conclude with their Burials, the Dead Bodies being well wash'd and sum'd with Incense, they wrap them up in proper Garments. If the Party deceas'd be of Noble Ex∣traction, he is lay'd upon the Bier, cover'd with a Bulls Hide; which done, the Clergy carry him to the Grave, laden with Crosses, Censors, and Holy-water; and that with a pace so swift, that it is a difficult matter to follow them. The Body is for some time set down by the Grave, during the reading of a certain Paragraph out of St. <HI>John</HI>'s Gospel; after which, the Body, being found and sprinkl'd with Holy <HI>Water,</HI> is not let down, but thrown into the Sepulcher.</P>
<P>King <HI>Claudius</HI> being desirous to Solemnize the Exequies of <HI>Christopher Gomez,</HI> upon the Anniversary Day, that he had lost his Life, for the Recovery of <HI>Abassia,</HI> summon'd toge∣ther all the Priests, Canons, Monks, and all the Neighbour∣ing Poor People; and to the first, being about Six hundred, he gave a Royal Funeral Supper; to the last, being about Six thousand, he distributed a large and noble Alms. They on the other side recited the whole Psalter quite thorough, and made the Sky ring with innumerable <HI>Allelujahs,</HI> a Ceremony, that
<PB N="305" REF="142"/>
serves alike as well upon sad, as joyful Occasions. Thus when <HI>Marcus,</HI> the Eldest Son of <HI>Susneus,</HI> was Buried, they sounded forth,
<Q><L><HI>Marcus</HI> is Dead, Hallelujah,</L>
<L><HI>Marcus</HI> is Dead, Hallelujah.</L></Q></P>
<P>And this they repeated so often and so loud, that the Fa∣thers, but newly then arriv'd in. <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> were astonish'd to hear such an unwonted cry; not being able to tell, whether the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> rejoyc'd, or lamented. So strangely are all Nations delighted with their own Customs.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of the Constitution and Form of Ecclesiastical Go∣vernment in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> as also of the Priviledges of the Clergy.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Clergy enjoy no immunity. Their Head or <HI>Abuna</HI> created by the Metropolitan of <HI>Alexandria.</HI> His Place in Councils. The present State of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Church deplorable. The Clergy ignorant, the Pa∣triarch Illiterate. The <HI>Habessine</HI> Metropolitans ordain the Clergy only. No Bishops, nor Arch-Bishops. The <HI>Icegue</HI> governs the Monks. They acknowledge but four Oecumenical Patriarchs. The Catalogue of Metro∣politans incertain. They do not reck'n these sent by the Pope. After <HI>Mendez,</HI> one call'd the <HI>Cophtit.</HI> His Successors. The Orders of Deacon, Presbyter, and Sub-Presbyter. The Clergy Marry, but not twice.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE have already declar'd, That the Supream Power in Ecclesiastical Affairs, is invested in the King. Therefore all Ecclesiastical Causes, except only in very slight Matters, are all determin'd by the King's Judges. Neither do the <HI>Clergy</HI> or <HI>Monks</HI> enjoy any sort of Ecclesiastical Immunity, or Priviledge of Exemption. Nor does the Canon, <HI>Siquis suadente diabolo, hujus Sacrilegii reatum incurrerit, quod in Clericum vel Monachum violentas manus injecerit,</HI> &amp;c. help them at all, but that upon offences com∣mitted they are punish'd, as Lay Persons, by the Secular Judges: And many times they are sensible of the rough and violent hands of wicked Men, without any fear of Excom∣munication.
<PB N="306" REF="143"/>
But as to what concerns the <HI>Law of Order,</HI> or the <HI>Diocesan Law,</HI> those things are left to the Clergy. Their Chief Head is call'd <HI>Papas,</HI> or <HI>Metropolitan.</HI> Tho the Title or Sirname of <HI>Abuna,</HI> that is to say, <HI>Our Father,</HI> be more fre∣quently given him. He by ancient Custom, at the King's desire, is Consecrated to that Dignity by the Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and sent out of <HI>Egypt</HI> into <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> For they do not think it fitting for the Patriarch to nominate any one out of their own Nation, tho never so skilful in their Language, Laws and Customs. It being provided by those <HI>Nicene</HI> Ca∣nons, extant in the Arabic Language, <HI>That the</HI> Ethiopians <HI>shall not Elect or Create a Patriarch, but that their chief Chief Pre∣late shall be under the Jurisdiction of Him that resides at</HI> Alexan∣dria. And a little after, <HI>That if the Council be held in</HI> Greece, <HI>and the Prelate of</HI> Ethiopia <HI>be present, he shall have the seventh place, next the Prelate of</HI> Seleucia. For they are very obstinate in maintaining their old Customs, tho it happen to be one of their greatest Misfortunes. The State and Condition of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Church, being quite different now from what it was formerly; that is to say, altogether miserable and de∣plorable. For both the Patriarch and his Clergy, are a poor sort of contemptible and rustic People, and void of all com∣mon Endowments. They are as it were the Servants and Slaves of the <HI>Turks,</HI> whose continual vexations so terrifie them from undertaking Ecclesiastical Employment, that many times they receive their Ordination by constraint, and with Tears in their Eyes; which requires nothing more from them than to read <HI>Arabic.</HI></P>
<P>For the <HI>Coptic,</HI> or ancient <HI>Egyptian</HI> Language, as it was spo∣ken in the times of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Kings, and as <HI>Athanasius Kir∣ker</HI> has given a view of it to the <HI>Europeans,</HI> is now almost buried in Oblivion. Their Churches are either all destroy'd, or very near to Ruin; the <HI>Turks</HI> not suffering them either to Rebuild or Repair. The Patriarch, if he can but only read and write, and understand the Scripture after an ordinary manner, is thought sufficiently worthy of St. <HI>Mark</HI>'s <HI>Chair.</HI> Hence it may be easily conjectur'd, what sort of Persons are sent into <HI>Ethiopia</HI> for the Government of so many Churches. In the time of the Fathers of the Society, there was sent such a sad Tool into <HI>Habessinia,</HI> to be the <HI>Abuna,</HI> that being re∣jected for his Simplicity, he was forc'd to Grind Corn for his living. To whom another Succeeding, not much better
<PB N="307" REF="143"/>
gifted, gave occasion to the Courtiers to jest, and cry, <HI>We have a Miller still.</HI> Now as these Patriarchs know very little, so they do as little, only in set forms of Words, they ordain Under-Clercs, just as wise and learned as themselves.</P>
<P>For this reason the Fathers of the Society, little regarded the Ordinations of the <HI>Abuna,</HI> but when any of the <HI>Abessine</HI> Priests came over to them, they ordain'd them again after the <HI>Roman</HI> manner, not without the great resentment and indig∣nation of the rest.</P>
<P>In none of their Kingdoms or Provinces have they any <HI>Bishops</HI> or <HI>Arch-Bishops.</HI> So that unless the <HI>Icegue,</HI> with the assistance of his Monks, had taken some care of the Church, all thought of Religion had fallen to the ground long e're this.</P>
<P>This <HI>Abuna</HI> is by some, tho improperly call'd <HI>Patriarch,</HI> his truer Title being that of <HI>Bik Papas,</HI> or <HI>Bik Papaste,</HI> Prince or Master of the Metropolitans; of whom they acknowledge only Four to be of equal Power and Dignity among them∣selves. Among these they reckon the <HI>Roman</HI> Patriarch to be the First, and call him <HI>Bik Papaste Zaromeja,</HI> or the <HI>Roman Pa∣triarch.</HI> For they have no higher Title to give to any one who may be thought Superior to a Patriarch.</P>
<P>The first Metropolitan of <HI>Habessinia</HI> was <HI>Frumentius,</HI> the Ethiopic Apostle. From him to <HI>Simeon,</HI> who dy'd with <HI>Elius</HI> in defence of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Religion, they reck'n in order Ninety five Metropolitans. We have not yet seen the Cata∣logue, but in the Ethiopic Register, they are Number'd up in this Order.</P>

To him succeeded one <HI>John,</HI> and about the year 1651. ano∣ther call'd <HI>Mark,</HI> who being depos'd for his vitious life, <HI>Mi∣chael</HI> succeeded him.

<P>As for the Cathedrals or Principal Churches, they have their chief <HI>Overseers,</HI> which they call <HI>Komasat.</HI> Such a <HI>Komos</HI> was <HI>Peter</HI> the <HI>Ethiopian,</HI> whose acquaintance was courted by <HI>Paulus Jovius.</HI> It is their Duty to take care of the Secular Matters of the Churches, and to compose the differences between the Clergy-men, so far as their Jurisdiction extends.

As for those <HI>Under-Ministers,</HI> which in the Primitive Church were known by the Name of <HI>Readers,</HI> they are quite out of Use: as are also <HI>Deaconesses,</HI> of which however they have the great∣est need, by reason of the frequent Baptizings of full-grown Women, to whom their assistance, while the Ceremony of their Baptism requires them to be naked, is most ne∣cessary.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="144"/>All Ecclesiastical Persons, when they walk publickly a∣broad, carry a Cross in their hands, and offer it to all they meet to be Kiss'd, having hardly any other note of Distin∣ction from the Layety. The same sort of Cross the <HI>Seculars</HI> also carry, who to the end they may be admitted into the Sanctuary, desire to be ordain'd Deacons; as also most young Children.</P>
<P>All the Clergy, except the Monks, are permitted to Mar∣ry. Neither will any man deny, but that it was Lawful for the Catholic Bishops of the Primitive Church, the Presbyters and Deacons to do the same; which was also upon the Per∣suasion and Arguments of <HI>Paphnutius</HI> a most Holy Man; al∣low'd of and approv'd by the Fathers of the <HI>Nicene</HI> Coun∣cil, as both <HI>Socrates</HI> and <HI>Sozomenus</HI> testifie: whose Credit ju∣stify'd by all Antiquity, was never yet call'd in question; especially being confirm'd by the practice, and so many clear and undeniable Presidents of the Primitive Church, till <HI>Siri∣cius</HI> and <HI>Innocent</HI> the First, took upon them to order it other∣wise in the Latin Church.</P>
<P>Among the Eastern Churches, honest and lawful Matri∣mony was in much more high esteem, than faithless Batche∣lorship, obnoxious to perpetual concupiscence. Wherefore the <HI>Grecians, Armenians, Russians,</HI> but more especially our <HI>Ethiopians</HI> not only permitted their Presbyters to Marry, but soonest prefer the Husbands of Wives; insomuch that the nearest way to that Preferment is to Marry. For they take the words of the Apostle, <HI>Let him be the Husband of one Wife, for a Precept;</HI> yet understand it only so, as not to extend any farther, but to one single Marriage. And therefore their Clergy never offer to covet repeated Wedlocks, which even by the Seculars were not approv'd in the Eastern Churches. The <HI>Novatians</HI> detested a second Wedlock after Baptism, as equal to the Crime of Adultery. The Latin Fathers also gave it an Ignominious Character, reproaching it with the Scandalous Title of honest Adultery. But in after Ages, the Matter being more wisely consider'd, it was not thought material, whether the same Person Married one or more Wives, after Death had once made the Seperation, so that the Matrimony were lawful; since there appear'd no reason to the contrary. For which was alleadg'd the fa∣mous example of one Woman at <HI>Rome,</HI> that had surviv'd the Two and twentieth Wedlock. But the <HI>Habessines</HI> still

observe their ancient Laws: in regard that by the ancient Canons, they that Marry twice, are accompted unworthy of Holy Orders.</P>

<P>THE <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Church remain'd in Unity with it self, and with the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, till the <HI>Council of</HI> Chalcedon, by us call'd the <HI>Fourth Universal Council,</HI> which <HI>Marcian</HI> the Emperor Summon'd, to appease the Dis∣cords and Dissentions that were risen among the Bishops and Divines, by reason of the Doctrine of <HI>Eutyches.</HI> This <HI>Eutyches,</HI> a Constantinopolitan Abbot asserted, <HI>That both the Natures of Christ, the Divine and Human, upon his Incarnation, immediately became one and the same; and that therefore there was but one Na∣ture, and one Will in Christ.</HI> For which reason, they that held this Opinion were call'd <HI>Monothelites.</HI> Thereupon it was Decreed in this Council, <HI>That Christ was of the same Substance with the Father, according to his Deity, but Sin excepted; of the same Substance, and like to us in all things, according to his Hu∣manity. One and the same in two Natures united, yet without mixture, mutation, division or distance, both Natures acting that which was proper to it, by Communion with each other Dioscurus</HI> also, the Pa∣triarch of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> was condemn'd as a Heretic, &amp; Defender of <HI>Eutyches;</HI> and not only so, but being publickly whipp'd, he was sent into Exile, and another put up in his room, who because he follow'd the Emperors or the Royal Religion,
<PB N="311" REF="145"/>
was therefore call'd a <HI>Melchite,</HI> or Royalists according to the <HI>Arabic</HI> word. The Contradicters of this Opinion were call'd <HI>Eutychians,</HI> afterwards <HI>Jacobites</HI> from one <HI>Jacob,</HI> a Syrian, who stoutly defended the Doctrine of <HI>Eutyches.</HI> Hence arose a most fierce and outragious Schism in the Church of <HI>Alexan∣dria,</HI> defil'd with Blood and Slaughter, which was the rea∣son that not only the greatest part of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Church was rent and torn from the rest of the Catholic Church; but that <HI>Egypt</HI> also, weaken'd with it's own civil Dissentions, became a Prey to the <HI>Saracens,</HI> who taking advantage of the Discords of the Christians among themselves, overcame and subjugated the upholders of both Opinions: so that now there is little or nothing remaining of Christianity in <HI>Egypt.</HI> Thus our Ecclesiastical Writers.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> relate, that <HI>Dioscorus,</HI> his Successors, and their Followers, heavily complain'd of the Injury done them: for that he never follow'd <HI>Eutyches,</HI> nor ever deny'd nor con∣fus'd the Divinity and Humanity really existing in Christ; only he would not acknowledge the word <HI>Nature</HI> to be common to the Divinity and Humanity of Christ: and that he only endeavour'd to prevent the Asserting of two Persons in Christ, contrary to the Opinion of the Catholic Church, and the Decrees of the Council of <HI>Ephesus;</HI> believing that absurdity would follow, should we admit two Wills and Natures in Christ. Lastly, That the word <HI>Nature,</HI> sig∣nifying something Born or Created, did no way quadrate with Divinity, neither could two Wills in two Natures, united without Division, Separation, or Distance be con∣ceiv'd by the understanding of Man: That it was not to be thought that Human Nature exalted to a State of Glory, would desire, act, or suffer, what is suffer'd, acted, or de∣sired in the State of Mortality; or that Humanity in a pre∣sent State of Glory, should desire or be sensible of that which Divinity was not sensible of or desir'd. Which Opinion of his being heard and understood, it seem'd an idle Question, a meer brangling Dispute, that little deserv'd to be the occa∣sion of so much Enmity among the Christians; as being become rather a Quarrel to be decided by the Sword, and not by Argument. And therefore these things consider'd, it was evident that <HI>Dioscurus,</HI> was neither sufficiently heard nor rightly understood, but in his absence condemn'd as an obstinate Heretick, rather out of Hatred and Envy then by
<PB N="312" REF="146"/>
Law. These and such like things when I heard <HI>Gregory</HI> dis∣coursing, I began to apply my mind more particularly to this Affair, as being willing to know whether he only ex∣pressed his own Thoughts, or according to the Opinions and Writings of his own Country Doctors.</P>
<P>In the first place therefore I found it beyond all doubt, that the <HI>Habessines</HI> do reject the Council of <HI>Calcedon,</HI> tho they un∣derstand not what was done therein, as having never re∣ceiv'd or thought worthy of their Transcription the <HI>Canons</HI> there made. Nevertheless they inveigh most bitterly against the Council, and the Fathers there assembled, and load them with most injurious reproaches, calling them <HI>Mahebar Abdan,</HI> a <HI>Convention of Fools,</HI> &amp; <HI>Qualqedanowe jau,</HI> reck'ning the <HI>Chalcedo∣nians</HI> among the worst of Heretics and Malefactors. In the second place, I observ'd them fix'd in this Error, as believing the Fathers of the Council of <HI>Chalcedon</HI> went about to divide the Substance of Christ, and contrary to the preceding Coun∣cil of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> to make two Persons of one, which they also attribute to the Latins. For this reason they condemn Pope <HI>Leo,</HI> and extol <HI>Dioscurus</HI> to the Skies, as the Champion of the Orthodox Faith, as being the Person, that out of a just and zealous Indignation, tore <HI>Leo</HI>'s <HI>Diploma,</HI> as soon as it was deliver'd to him; and reck'n him among the Number of Mar∣tyrs, for suffering himself to be scourg'd, his Teeth struck out, and his Beard pull'd off, for standing to the Truth.</P>
<Q><L>Peace to <HI>Dioscurus,</HI> that still reproach'd</L>
<L>The vain Opinions that the <HI>Melkites</HI> broach'd,</L>
<L>United God dividing into Two:</L>
<L>Then to confirm his <HI>Own</HI> in what was true,</L>
<L>His broken Teeth and Beard torn from his Chin,</L>
<L>Sends round the World t' evince <HI>Chalcedon</HI>'s spleen.</L></Q>
<P>They also ascertain themselves of a great reward laid up for Him in Heaven, in recompence of his so rigid Suf∣ferings.</P>
<P>In the third place, I found that they expresly condemn <HI>Eu∣tyches</HI> as a Heretic, but on the other side applaud <HI>Timotheus,</HI> the Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> (whom our Writers affirm to have bin condemn'd in the Sixth general Council) by whose Doctrine, the followers of <HI>Eutyches</HI> were convicted; for so the same Poet, tho otherwise a cruel Enemy of the <HI>Chalcedo∣nian</HI> Fathers writes of him.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="146"/><HI>They that believ'd the Heretical Doctrine of</HI> Eutyches, <HI>were burnt by the Flames of his Expressions.</HI></P>
<P>Tho <HI>Gregory</HI> being demanded what he knew concerning him, made answer,</P>
<P><HI>That there were in</HI> Ethiopia, <HI>aswel they who believ'd that</HI> Eu∣tyches <HI>had made a confusion of the two Natures of Christ, as they who believ'd he had not done it.</HI></P>
<P>Whence it appears that <HI>Eutyches,</HI> not his Errors, is defend∣ed by some of the <HI>Ethiopians.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, it is apparent, That they acknowledge both <HI>Mabqot</HI> and <HI>Tesbet</HI> the Divinity and Humanity to be both Ab∣stractively and Conjunctively in Christ. Which is as much as to allow two Natures together in Christ.</P>
<P>Fifthly, <HI>Tellez</HI> attests from the Relation of the Fathers of the Society, that both Natures are to be found in their Books, and imputes it to their Contumacy, that they will not ac∣knowledge in words what they believe concerning the Ca∣tholic Truth, when they teach the same thing in their Wri∣tings, <HI>That the Catholic</HI> Habessines <HI>suffering Persecution from the Hereticks, cry'd out,</HI> God and Man, <HI>whereby they both asserted the Catholic Faith, and the two Natures in Christ.</HI> But more then this, we have the Testimony of <HI>Susneus,</HI> in one of whose Orations to his Soldiers, we find that all the <HI>Habessines</HI> con∣fess, <HI>That Christ is the true God, and true Man;</HI> and consequent∣ly, we must allow what the <HI>Fathers</HI> of the Society relate, that they acknowledge two Natures in Christ.</P>
<P>Sixthly, we are to take notice, That the words which the Greeks use, and which the Latines have made use of in these difficult questions of Faith, as <HI>Essence, Substance</HI> or <HI>Subsistance, Person, Nature,</HI> among the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> are interpreted by words Equivocal, from whence it is no wonder there should be such a spring of Errors. For <HI>Helave,</HI> sometimes signifies <HI>Essence,</HI> sometimes <HI>Hypostasis</HI> or <HI>Substance. Gregory</HI> also affirm'd, That there were some who assert <HI>Qalet Helwejet,</HI> two Essences, that is the Divinity and Humanity in Christ, and that each Nature retains its proper Essence. Others for fear of falling into the <HI>Nestorian</HI> Error, rather chose to make use of the word <HI>Bakreye,</HI> which properly signifies a <HI>Pearl,</HI> affirming there are in Christ <HI>Qalit Bah reyat,</HI> two precious Substances; in imitation of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> who use their own word, which signifies a <HI>Pearl,</HI> by which to express the Divine <HI>Subsistance.</HI> Which others again dislike, as being a
<PB N="314" REF="147"/>
word no less Equivocal, because it may be taken either for <HI>Subsistance</HI> or <HI>Person;</HI> as when they of the Son, <HI>Zatwalda em∣baha reju Baab, who was born of the Substance of the Father.</HI> Thus the Author of a certain Manuscript call'd, <HI>The Ecclesiastical Computation</HI> concludes,
<Q>Who were witness of one Person of Christ, <HI>Synodius</HI> Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>From whence we gather, that when we from the Council of <HI>Chalcedon</HI> dispute of the <HI>Nature,</HI> they mean the <HI>Person.</HI> Now adays, when they speak of the <HI>Person,</HI> they make use for the most part of the word <HI>Agal,</HI> as being less Equivocal; tho sometime we shall meet with the word <HI>Gaz</HI> to signifie <HI>Person,</HI> ill render'd when taken for the <HI>Countenance</HI> or <HI>Face.</HI> Which Circumstances, when I read and consider, I find all things to be perplex'd and obscure; no certain State of the Question; and the words themselves without limitation Equi∣vocal. Perhaps <HI>Eutyches</HI> himself could not explain what sort of <HI>Nature</HI> was meant, how it was made out of the <HI>two?</HI> How it was call'd? or what the Qualities of it were? But that he was so egregiously stupid, as to think the two Natures so mix'd in Christ, as <HI>Water with Wine,</HI> and that he had so many Wise and Learned Men to follow him in that Opinion, is almost incredible. As for the <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> they are most certainly not guilty of so sottish a Heresie. For which reason I confess, I cannot apprehend what these frequent Disputations were, which the Fathers of the Society had with the <HI>Habessines,</HI> wherein, they say, the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> were always forc'd to sub∣mit, as being convicted out of their own Books. Which is the more easie to believ'd, in regard they so willingly ac∣knowledge the Divinity and Humanity of Christ. But that they should out of Contumacy and Heretical Pravity con∣tradict the Fathers, and choose to suffer Exilements, and other Punishments, or run the hazard of Civil Dissentions, rather than forego their Opinion, is hardly to be credited. To me it seems therefore more probable, that they could not agree about the words. For if a man should first explain his meaning, and tell them, that by the two Natures in Christ, we understand as well his Divinity as his Humanity, and then upon this Explanation ask them, <HI>Which Nature was wanting in Christ, seeing they acknowledge but one?</HI> Certainly
<PB N="315" REF="147"/>
they would answer, <HI>That neither his Divinity nor his Humanity were wanting; but that both continue and endure for ever.</HI> And thus it will appear, that they understand the word <HI>Nature</HI> far otherwise than we do, and that the true state of the Question among the <HI>Habessines</HI> consists in this, <HI>Whether by any, or by what name both the Abstract Natures</HI> (which undoubt∣edly they admit) <HI>are to be call'd?</HI> Now therefore because <HI>Tellez</HI> does not say in what Language they Disputed (for the <HI>Habessines</HI> understand neither <HI>Latin</HI> nor <HI>Portuguese</HI>) how they express'd themselves when they mention'd the words <HI>Essence, Person,</HI> and <HI>Nature,</HI> how they explain'd Equivocal words, or how the Interpreters render'd them, whether they could not agree upon the common <HI>word,</HI> or whether the word <HI>Substance</HI> displeas'd, as fearing that to grant two <HI>Substances,</HI> would be to grant two Persons, I leave to farther enqui∣ry. Nor can I find out in so much Variety and Ambiguity of words, what word is most proper to be us'd in our sense for the word Nature. For the <HI>Jacobites</HI> when they make use of the Arabic <HI>Tabia,</HI> or the Ethiopic <HI>Tabaje,</HI> which answers to the Greek word <HI>Physis,</HI> and by the <HI>Copts</HI> is call'd <HI>D Physis,</HI> apply it only to things created, more especially to the Elements, but never to the <HI>Godhead:</HI> which the <HI>Melkites</HI> and <HI>Greeks</HI> being destitute of any other, make no scruple to do. Hence the Contention. For thus saith <HI>Eutychius,</HI> Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> a <HI>Melkite;</HI> In Christ there are,
<Q>Two Substances, a Substance of Divinity, and a Substance of Humanity; but one Person. To every Substance there belongs a Nature; and so two Substances, two Natures, but one Person.</Q></P>
<P>For this reason, in <HI>Egypt,</HI> where this unhappy difference still remains, when the <HI>Copts</HI> cry out in Arabic <HI>Mashiah Wahid, Tabiah Wahid, One Will, one Nature;</HI> the Melkites answer, <HI>Mashiatan tabiahtan, Two Wills, two Natures.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1634. an <HI>European</HI> of great Quality residing in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and having vievv'd and read the Books of the <HI>Copts,</HI> deliver'd his Opinion aftervvards, <HI>That the difference and quarrel of the Parties proceeded more from a fear of the Con∣sequence, than from the Thing it self. For the</HI> Greeks <HI>are for the Destruction of those Hereticks that confuse and mix the Divinity

and Humanity of Christ. The</HI> Cophtites <HI>oppugn those that assert two Persons in Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Which if it be so, that the Contention and Debate, either formerly, or now, is only about the sence of words, What Tears and Lamentations can suffice to bewail the sad Effects of such an Unfortunate Pedantic Brabble? What breast that lodges a heart so hard, that can refrain from bemoaning the sad and calamitous Contentions of those, to whom Christ has so earnestly recommended the most strict Bonds of Charity by his own Example? Humanity one would think, should not be so inhuman, for the sake of one word <HI>Nature</HI> misunderstood, to tear up the foundations of Concord between those, whose Nature the Eternal Word has assum'd into his most Holy Subsistence. But as it is the Infirmity of our most corrupted Nature, where Ambition, from Ambition Emulation, from Emulation Envy, from Envy Hatred have taken root, that the Mind possess'd with various Passions and Affections, seeks no farther after Truth, hence it is that Men with Ears obstructed, and blinded Eyes, pursue disputes to sa∣tisfie their private Ends; not considering the true end of Arguing and Dispute.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of the Differences which happen'd between the <HI>Ha∣bessines</HI> and the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> more especially the Fathers of the Society to the beginning of this Century.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Patriarch of the <HI>Melkites</HI> and <HI>Jacobites,</HI> which the <HI>Habessines</HI> follow∣ing, disunited themselves from the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans.</HI> They had Knowledge of the Pope. <HI>Alexander</HI> the Third writes to the King of <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> An Embassie to <HI>Eugenius</HI> the Fourth, and <HI>Clement</HI> the 7th. <HI>John Bermudes</HI> confirm'd by <HI>Paul</HI> the Third. Whence Hopes of sub∣jecting the <HI>Habessines</HI> to the See of <HI>Rome. Barret</HI> and <HI>Oviedo</HI> made Patriarchs. They send before to sound the King. They Dispute with the King concerning Religion. The <HI>Portugueses</HI> suspected. <HI>Barret</HI> stays in <HI>India, Oviedo</HI> kindly receiv'd. <HI>Claudius</HI> acts moderately. Grants Liberty to the <HI>Latins. Oviedo</HI> desires more. The King delays. Mov'd with <HI>Oviedo</HI>'s Epistle. <HI>Oviedo</HI> Attempts Severity but in vain. To <HI>Claudius</HI> his Brother Succeeds. The <HI>Latins</HI> Liberty revok'd. <HI>Oviedo</HI> threaten'd. <HI>Melech Saghed</HI> milder to the <HI>Portugueses.</HI> All their Priests Die.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Horrid flames of Discord being thus broken forth, all those Nations that were Subject to the Alexandrian <HI>See,</HI> separated themselves into Parties almost equal in Strength. And every Faction chose its par∣ticular Faction. The <HI>Grecian</HI> Christians, who were in Sub∣jection to the <HI>Constantinopolitan</HI> Emperor, adher'd to the Pa∣triarch of the <HI>Melkites;</HI> The rest who inhabited the inner∣most Parts of <HI>Africa,</HI> and among them the <HI>Axumites,</HI> follow'd the Patriarch of the <HI>Jacobites;</HI> and thus being rent not only from the <HI>Greek,</HI> but <HI>Roman</HI> Church, they had little or no knowledge of either. After this, the Power of the <HI>Saracens</HI> increasing, and all <HI>Egypt</HI> being by them subdu'd, all Corre∣spondence and Communication of Arts and Knowledge ceas'd between <HI>Them,</HI> and the <HI>Christians</HI> of our part of the World. Nevertheless some glimpses they had of the <HI>Roman Pontiffs,</HI> from the Acts of the Ancient Councils, and reve∣renc'd them as Chief among the Oecunomical Patriarchs. On the other side the Pope laying hold of the occasion, en∣deavour'd to Re-establish the former Correspondence and Amity, not taking any notice of their being <HI>Monothelites,</HI>
<PB N="318" REF="150"/>
or Favourers of the condemn'd <HI>Dioscurus.</HI> To this purpose <HI>Baronius</HI> has set forth an Epistle taken out of <HI>Roger</HI>'s <HI>English Annals,</HI> written by <HI>Alexander</HI> the Third, with this Super∣scription. <HI>To our most dear Son in Christ, the Illustrious and Mag∣nificent King of the</HI> Indians, <HI>the most Holy of Priests.</HI> Which Epistle he erroneously believes to have bin written to <HI>Prester John,</HI> whose Dominions were then very large in <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> For that when <HI>Baronius</HI> wrote, the King of the <HI>Habessines</HI> was reputed and commonly taken for <HI>Prester John.</HI> But when <HI>Alexander</HI> the Third liv'd, the real <HI>Prester John</HI> was then reigning in <HI>Asia.</HI> Neither is any thing to be gather'd out of that whole Epistle, that has any Relation to <HI>Africa,</HI> or <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> or the King of the <HI>Habessines;</HI> nor are the Consequences of that Letter known to <HI>Baronius.</HI> Only upon that occasion, he conjectures that the Church of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> with the Buildings behind St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Cathedral, were there∣upon assign'd to the <HI>Habessinians;</HI> though he is not certain by whom that Assignation was made, whether by <HI>Alexander</HI> or any other Succeeding Pope. Therefore, if the Epistle were real, we rather think it was written to the Asiatic <HI>Prester John,</HI> then to the King of the <HI>Ethiopians.</HI> Others there are, that believe there was an <HI>Abessinian</HI> Embassy to <HI>Clement</HI> the Fifth, residing at <HI>Avignon.</HI> Nor is there any doubt made of the Embassy which <HI>Zera-Jacob</HI> sent to <HI>Eugenius</HI> the Fourth, in the year 1439. toward the Conclusion of the Council of <HI>Florence. Gregory</HI> had known nothing of it, had he not seen the Embas∣sador and his Retinue painted at <HI>Rome,</HI> and known his own Countrymen by their Habit.</P>
<P>In the former Century, <HI>Francis Alvarez,</HI> Priest to the <HI>Por∣tugal</HI> Ambassadors sent into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> brought Letters from <HI>David</HI> to <HI>Clement</HI> the Seventh, which he delivered to the Pope in a public Assembly of the Cardinals, <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth being there also present, promising Reverence and Obedience withal to the Holy See, in the Name of the King of <HI>Ethio∣pia.</HI> It was a thing very grateful to the Pope, that at a time when so many Northern Nations had revolted from the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> See, so many Kingdoms of the East and South, should voluntarily submit to his Jurisdiction. For which reason, neither <HI>Alvarez</HI>'s Credentials, nor the words of the Epistle were over-nicely examin'd, nor any extraordinary Scrutiny made to what Church, or what sort of Religion the King him∣self was enclin'd, to the end that had it been needful, he might
<PB N="319" REF="150"/>
have bin absolv'd from the guilt of Heresie, before his Ad∣mission into the Bosom of the Church. For as we shall afterwards declare, the <HI>Habessines</HI> made quite another In∣terpretation of their King's Intention. In the mean time a certain form of Friendship long remain'd. For when <HI>John Bermudes</HI> came to <HI>Rome</HI> to crave Assistance from the <HI>Europeans</HI> in the behalf of <HI>David,</HI> so often vanquish'd by the <HI>Adelans; Paul</HI> the Third, hearing that the said <HI>Bermudes</HI> was by <HI>Mark</HI> the Metropolitan, nominated his Successor, and invested with Holy Orders, made no scruple to confirm him, and to ratifie the Ordination of a Schismatical Prelate. There were then residing certain <HI>Habessines,</HI> very good Men, who Printed the New Testament with their Liturgies in the E∣thiopic Language, whom the Pope did not only tolerate, but assisted at his own Expences. In recompence of which Kindnesses, they extoll'd and applauded the Benevolence of the <HI>Romans,</HI> the Munificence of the Chief Pontiff, and his Spiritual Daughter <HI>Hyeronyma Farnesia,</HI> and acknowledg'd the Pope as the Head and Supream over all the Orthodox Christians. <HI>Pius</HI> the Fifth also in his Letters to <HI>Menas,</HI> tho a professed Enemy to the <HI>Romans,</HI> call'd him his <HI>most dear Son;</HI> whether he were ignorant of his hatred to the <HI>Latins,</HI> which was a wonder; or whether he had hopes to reclaim him by flattering Titles, which <HI>Godignus</HI> rather conjectures to be the Pope's true Intention. For this reason, some there were who believ'd the <HI>Habessines</HI> to be Catholicks in the highest perfe∣ction, and subject to the See of <HI>Rome;</HI> tho <HI>Tellez</HI> deservedly taxes and derides their Credulity. Nevertheless a vain hope had possessed the Minds of many of the more Zealous sort, that that vast Kingdom, then look'd upon to be four times as big as really it was, might in a short time, with little diffi∣culty, be annexed to the Pontifical Jurisdiction. Among the rest, the Founder of the Society of <HI>Jesus, Ignatius Loyola,</HI> bent all his Study to bring it to pass, and to that end he shew'd a most Ardent desire to go himself, and win the honour of Converting <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> Which tho <HI>Julius</HI> the Third would not grant him the liberty to do, nevertheless he so far pre∣vail'd with him, that by the connivance of <HI>John</HI> the Third King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> the Patriarchal Dignity was conferr'd up∣on <HI>John Nonius Barret,</HI> one of his Companions, contrary to the Institutions of his Society, tho <HI>Bermudes</HI> were then in <HI>Ethiopia</HI> already dignify'd with the same Title. With him
<PB N="320" REF="151"/>
was joyn'd <HI>Andrew Oviedo,</HI> a Bishop, that if <HI>Barret</HI> through Mortality should miscarry, he might not want an immedi∣ate Successor. They, Embarking in several Ships, sayl'd into <HI>India.</HI> In the mean time <HI>Claudius</HI> was become Successor to <HI>Da∣vid</HI> his Father, whose affection they thought it first expedient to sound, before the Patriarch should expose himself to Casu∣alties and Indignities. <HI>Jacobus Dias</HI> was therefore sent be∣fore, together with <HI>Gonsales Rodriguez,</HI> and <HI>Fulgentio Freyre,</HI> Jesuits; who toward the beginning of <HI>February</HI> setting Sail from <HI>Goâ,</HI> and a Month after arriving at the Port of <HI>Arkiko,</HI> were there curteously receiv'd by the President of the Ma∣ritime Province, and within the space of two Months brought to the King. Who understanding that the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> was about to send Priests, and other Ecclesiastical Persons to teach him and his People a new Religion, was very much perplex'd in his Mind, and long in Suspence what answer to return; for he neither thought it convenient to admit them, neither was he willing to offend the King of <HI>Portugal.</HI> However he ventur'd upon several Colloquies with the Envoys, the sum of which, manag'd for the most part by <HI>Gonsalez,</HI> tended to this, <HI>That the Pope of</HI> Rome <HI>was Christ's Vicar upon Earth, and the Supream Head of all Christia∣nity, and therefore if the</HI> Habessines <HI>were desirous of Eternal Hap∣piness, they should once more return and joyn themselves to their Law∣ful Head; for that Christ himself had from his own lips asserted, that his Church was but one Fold, and over that but one Shepheard,</HI> &amp;c. On the other side, the <HI>Habessines</HI> made answer, <HI>That an Af∣fair of so great Consequence was to be consider'd and consulted upon with the other Patriarchs; for to abandon their ancient Rites and Ceremonies upon private admonition, and receive new ones, was a thing full of danger and offence.</HI> At length the King told them, <HI>That if those Persons whom the King of</HI> Portugal <HI>should send, would take the pains to come to</HI> Matzua, <HI>he would order some Per∣son to be there, both to give them a befitting Reception, and Con∣duct them to his Court.</HI> Besides all this, the King was no less fearful, least the <HI>Portugals,</HI> as it had befallen several other Kings in <HI>India,</HI> should make him their Tributary, and un∣der the pretence of Religion, powre into his Country a great force of Soldiers, Arm'd and furnish'd with Fire-Arms; Especially remembring what great Exploits a small Num∣ber of <HI>Portugals</HI> had perform'd in his Kingdom but a few years before. A Jealousie that not long after increas'd to
<PB N="321" REF="151"/>
that height, that when King <HI>David</HI> had seriously negotiated with <HI>Roderigo Limez,</HI> the <HI>Portugal</HI> Embassador, about the Re∣covery and Fortification of <HI>Matzua,</HI> and <HI>Suaqena,</HI> and had also offer'd assistance of Forces, Provision and Money, afterwards the Business was not only no farther mention'd, but also the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Aid, so necessary, and so much desir'd was ut∣terly refus'd; so that he chose rather to leave the Port of <HI>Arkiko,</HI> with the Island adjoyning, in the hands of the <HI>Turk,</HI> then to give Admission to the <HI>Portugals. So prevalent is the fear of Foreign Domination.</HI></P>
<P>But now <HI>Claudius</HI>'s answer being return'd into <HI>India,</HI> strange∣ly surpriz'd the Patriarch <HI>Barret,</HI> and his Associates, who imagin'd that all things would have bin smooth and easie according to their wishes. Thereupon after long delibera∣tion, they came to this result, <HI>Lest the Patriarchal Dignity should be hazarded with a Prince ill affected, which would be to the Detri∣ment of the Pontifical Authority, and a contempt of the King of</HI> Por∣tugal, <HI>by whose recommendation and favour they were sent, that the Patriarch should remain in</HI> India <HI>with</HI> Melchior Caymero <HI>Bishop of</HI> Nice, <HI>and that</HI> Oviedo <HI>should go alone, to the end he might take his measures by the Event of</HI> Oviedo<HI>'s Success. Oviedo</HI> being thus dispatch'd away with Five more Associates, was kindly receiv'd by <HI>Isaac</HI> at that time <HI>Bahrnagass,</HI> or Go∣vernor of the Sea-Ports. The Common People ignorant of their Errand, nor altogether averse to the <HI>Romish</HI> Ceremo∣nies, receiv'd the Bishop and his Associates with great testi∣monies of Kindness, even to the kissing their hands. The Romanists laying hold upon the occasion, resolv'd upon a <HI>Procession</HI> from their own to the <HI>Habessine</HI> Church, and were by them beheld with mutual Charity, without the least up∣brading or reproach of the Novelty. The King also en∣tertain'd them with great kindness; only he took it ill that they should talk to him of yielding obedience to the <HI>Roman Pontiff.</HI> Nevertheless as he was a most Prudent Person, and worthy the high Dignity he enjoy'd, he always carry'd him∣self with so great Moderation toward the Bishop, that he still left him with some hopes of Success. In the mean time the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion was every where freely exercis'd, and no man forbid who defir'd to embrace it. But the Bishop not content with so much favour, began to press the King more urgently, <HI>That at length without more delay, he would sub∣mit himself to the</HI> Roman <HI>Pontiff.</HI> He reply'd, <HI>That his An∣cestors
<PB N="322" REF="152"/>
had in sacred things given their Obedience to none but the Successors of St.</HI> Mark; <HI>nor did he see any cause why he should desire Innovation, and disturb his People well contented with their</HI> Abuna? But the Bishop still continuing his Importunity, The King told him, <HI>That since he was come to him from a Region so far di∣stant upon so honest a Negotiation, he would consult with his Friends and his Learned Men upon a Matter of so great Importance. Oviedo</HI> understanding that the King did nothing but spin out delays; and hearing withal, that the King's Mother, and all the Blood Royal, together with the Nobility and greatest Do∣ctors of the Nation were utterly averse to any Alterations, wrote an Epistle to the King, wherein he put him in Mind, <HI>That his Father had acknowledg'd the Pope of</HI> Rome <HI>for the Vicar of Christ; that several of his Learned men had besought him; that</HI> Claudius <HI>had wrote to the King of</HI> Portugal; <HI>and that his Father had Commanded, that they should not desire an</HI> Abuna <HI>from any other place then from</HI> Rome: <HI>and that He himself had publickly promis'd Obedience to thee See of</HI> Rome. <HI>That if any doubt remain'd con∣cerning any Articles of Faith, he should bring those things to a Pub∣lick Dispute, and hear the Arguments on both sides: it being but just, that the Party that was foil'd, should acknowledge and fol∣low what the other had maintain'd for Truth: and that the King should well consider whose advice he took, or what Persons he consulted in so important an Affair. That the Ends and Interest of Parents or Kindred were not to be regarded: That the love of Christ was to be preferr'd before the love of Relations, who be∣ing busied in Teaching his own Doctrine in the Temple of</HI> Jeru∣salem, <HI>would not make use of his most Holy Mothers advice; by which he shew'd, that in the Cause of God no Man is bound to Communicate his Intentions to his nearest Friends.</HI> Whether the King made any Answer, or what it was, is not known. But <HI>Gregory</HI> told me, That the sence of the King's Com∣mands and Letters, was quite different from the Exposi∣tions of <HI>Alvarez, Bermudes</HI> and others addicted to the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Religion made of them at <HI>Rome:</HI> and that it could not be otherwise, in regard that before the Reign of <HI>Susneus,</HI> the <HI>Habessines</HI> had never known what that Obedience meant. Hower the King, that he might not seem to distrust the strength of his own Cause, and the learning of his own Sub∣jects, permitted frequent Disputes, not yet made Publick by the Fathers of the Society. From this <HI>Tellez</HI> reports, <HI>That the</HI> Habessine <HI>Doctors appear'd very ignorant and illiterate in all
<PB N="323" REF="152"/>
their Disputes; as never having Study'd Logic, Syllogisms, nor En∣thymemes, nor having any knowledge of the Subtleties of Scholastic Divinity.</HI> From whence the Reader may readily Judge of the Progress and Events of such Disputes. <HI>Tellez</HI> goes on, and says, <HI>That</HI> Claudius <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ary of the illiterateness of his own People, for the most part undertook the Discourse himself, and gave</HI> Oviedo <HI>not a little Trouble.</HI> Moreover he complains, <HI>That the</HI> Habessines, <HI>when they were worsted, would never acknowledge it, but always boasted of the Victory, and so all those Disputes came to nothing.</HI> It was therefore thought more convenient to be∣take themselves to <HI>writing.</HI> Nor did the King decline the Combat, but answer'd them with other Writings, tho they have not as yet bin permitted to visit the <HI>European</HI> Regions. <HI>Oviedo</HI> impatient of his ill Success, and finding he could not bring the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Prince to do as he would have had him, re∣solv'd to a more severe but unseasonable course. And there∣fore, to testifie his Indignation, he left the Court, and pub∣lish'd a Writing, <HI>Where in he branded the</HI> Habessines <HI>with several Heresies, and exhorted his</HI> Portugueses <HI>to have a care of them.</HI> Which did not a little offend <HI>Claudius.</HI> For a mind free, and subject to none, when once it refuses the persuasion of Ar∣gument, is the more exasperated by affront and reviling. Nor can it be thought that any Prince will suffer himself and his Subjects to be traduc'd for Heretics within his own Do∣minions.</P>
<P>Not long after <HI>Claudius</HI> was slain in a Battel against the <HI>Adelans;</HI> to whom, in regard he dy'd without Issue, his Bro∣ther <HI>Adamas-Saghed</HI> Succeeded, a Person quite of another disposition, as one that retain'd nothing of his Moderation or Clemency. For whatever Indulgencies <HI>Claudius</HI> had granted to <HI>Oviedo,</HI> and the Embracers of his Doctrine, he re∣call'd them all; nor would he so much as permit that the <HI>Habessine</HI> Women, who were Marry'd to the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> should exercise the Religion of their Husbands; to which he added many other severe Edicts, declaring openly, <HI>That his Brother was therefore punish'd by God, because he did not per∣secute the Religion of the</HI> Franks; as it is frequent to attribute Adversity or Prosperity to neglected or protected Religion. Nay, he proceeded so far, that having sent for <HI>Oviedo,</HI> he threaten'd him with Death, if he continu'd divulging and sowing <HI>Roman</HI> Paradoxes in his Dominions. Which when the Bishop refus'd to consent to, saying, <HI>That God was to be
<PB N="324" REF="153"/>
obey'd, rather then Man,</HI> he drew his Scymiter in a rage, and unless the Queen, and some of the chief Nobility had pre∣vented him, had undoubtedly dispatch'd the Bishop to the other World. The Bishop therefore, in this desperate Con∣dition of Affairs retires to <HI>Fremona,</HI> where he lay conceal'd, thirty whole years together, and assuming to himself, after the Death of <HI>Barret,</HI> the Title of Patriarch, officiated among his own <HI>Portugueses,</HI> without any further molestation: in re∣gard that <HI>Melec-Saghed</HI> after his Father's violent Death, shew'd himself more mild, and temperate to the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> who behaving themselves more modestly, gave him no cause of Provocation. But at length all the Avenues into <HI>Habessinia</HI> being shut-up by the <HI>Turk,</HI> and the Fathers that were sent thither being all taken and slain, the State of Religion among the <HI>Portugueses</HI> was reduc'd to that extremity, that all the Fa∣thers being deceas'd, there was none remain'd alive to offi∣ciate Divine Service. At length <HI>Melchior Silvanus</HI> an Indian, Vicar of the Church of St. <HI>Anns</HI> in <HI>Goa,</HI> and for that reason disguis'd both by his Language and Colour, ventur'd into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> and there officiated till the Arrival of <HI>Peter Pays;</HI> after which he return'd into <HI>India,</HI> leaving the said <HI>Peter,</HI> as he had bin before, all alone in his office of Priesthood.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Arch-Bishop of <HI>Goa,</HI> and the Fathers of the So∣ciety were not ignorant of the afflicted Condition of the <HI>Roman</HI> Worship in <HI>Habessinia.</HI> And there∣fore, whereas before they had conceiv'd vast hope of Total Conversion of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> now the case was so far alter'd, that they found themselves put to a Necessity of providing for their own few Countrymen, least they should be utterly de∣stitute of Provision for the Salvation of their own Souls, as not having any Priests to perform Religious Duties among them. Mov'd therefore by the Instigation of Conscience, they took it into serious Consideration, least while they were busyed about Subjecting <HI>Abassia</HI> to the See of <HI>Rome,</HI> that nothing belong'd to it, they should loose their own Countrymen, Professors of their own Religion, who had reason enough to forsake those that forsook them. And therefore they made it their whole study how to supply them with Priests, to govern their Ecclesiastical Affairs. And indeed many had attempted the Journey, but in vain.
<PB N="326" REF="154"/>
Till at length with the dawn of the new Century, new hopes began to shine forth. For <HI>Peter Pays,</HI> after his first unfortunate Attempt, which had expos'd him to various Hazards, and a Captivity in <HI>Arabia,</HI> undertook a second Journey into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> wherein he prosperously Succeeded; being well skill'd both in the Countries, Customs and Fo∣reign Languages, and able to endure the temperature of those Climates. <HI>John Gabriel</HI> a famous <HI>Portuguese</HI> Collonel, had given King <HI>Jacob</HI> then reigning, notice of his coming, and had so possess'd the young Prince with the worth of the Per∣son, by the high Commendations which he gave him, that so soon as the Winter was over, the King sent for him. But he being soon after depos'd, <HI>Zadenghel</HI> was advanc'd in his Room. Thereupon <HI>Peter Pays</HI> kept himself still at <HI>Fremona;</HI> where, not believing his time could be better spent than in instructing the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Children, he chose out some of the riper Ingenuities, and in a short time so manur'd them, that they were able to answer to any Question propounded to them concerning the Christian Faith. A thing both un∣wonted and wonderful to the <HI>Habessines,</HI> to hear from Chil∣dren what they could hardly expect from Persons of years and Experience. But considering the Person, he was not so much wonderful neither; for he was a Man of a quick and ready Wit, that could fit himself to all Humours, of an affable and complaisant Temper, and well skill'd not only in the Liberal Sciences, but Mechanic Arts. The fame of so acute and laborious a Person, and so happy in his Instruction, being spread over the Neighbouring Regions, in a short time reach'd the young King's Ears; who being covetous to see such a Master and such Scholars, by his Letters invited him to Court. Thereupon in the Month of <HI>April,</HI> 1604. accom∣pany'd with two <HI>Portuguese</HI> Youths arriving at Court, he was honourably receiv'd by the King, as if he had bin one of the Nobles of his Kingdom, not without great distast taken by the Monks, whose Sloth compar'd to <HI>Peter</HI>'s Diligence and Industry, render'd them contemptible to most. The next day several Disputes began about Controversies in Religion, which the King was pleas'd both favourably and patiently to hear; Mass was also said after the <HI>Roman</HI> manner, and a Sermon Preach'd; with which <HI>Zadenghel</HI> was so taken, that having Communicated his Intentions to some of his inti∣mate Friends, he resolv'd to submit himself to the Pope.
<PB N="327" REF="154"/>
But in regard he durst not adventure to do it publickly, he first conjur'd <HI>Peter</HI> not to reveal the Secret, and then told him, <HI>That he was Convinc'd by his Arguments, that there was no other Universal Pastor and Vicar of Christ upon Earth beside the Pope of</HI> Rome. <HI>That to deny it to him, was to deny it to Christ; that who∣ever did not follow his Example, was not of the true Church; and that therefore he had Decreed to request a Patriarch and Fathers from</HI> Rome <HI>to instruct his People.</HI></P>
<P>Altho so sudden and so unexpected a Declaration of a King could not choose but infuse a joy unspeakable into the heart of <HI>Peter,</HI> yet he contain'd himself; only what his duty bound him to, he could not but highly extol the Pious Inten∣tions of the King. Nor did the King delay: The Secret with which he had trusted <HI>Peter</HI> under Oath, he himself made Publick, and presently set forth an Edict, <HI>That no Person should any longer observe the Sabbath as a Holy day.</HI> And indeed he was so forward, that <HI>Peter</HI> was fain to check his Celerity, and put a stop to his Career. However Letters were writ∣ten to <HI>Clement</HI> the VIII. and <HI>Philip</HI> the Third, King of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> and deliver'd to <HI>Peter</HI>'s care, for their safe and honourable conveyance. In these Letters <HI>he offer'd his Friend∣ship, his Soldiers, and his Workmen; and withal requested some of the Fathers of the Society of Jesus to instruct his Subjects.</HI> These things were not so privately carry'd, but that they were dis∣cover'd by some of the chief Nobility of the Kingdom, who were no way satisfy'd at these underminings of their ancient Religion: wherefore they conspir'd against their Prince, and flew him in Battel. <HI>Zadenghel</HI> being slain, all <HI>Peter</HI>'s great Hopes vanish'd of a sudden, not only through <HI>Za∣denghel</HI>'s fall, but by reason of the Civil Wars that ensu'd be∣tween <HI>Jacob</HI> and <HI>Susneus,</HI> contending for the Royal Diadem. And so all Promotion of the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion surceas'd, till <HI>Jacob</HI> being vanquish'd and kill'd in the Field, <HI>Susneus</HI> became Lord of <HI>Habessinia.</HI> Who again kindly receiv'd and entertain'd <HI>Peter</HI> together with his Companions, and to all his Requests lent a most gracious Ear.</P>
<P>The Ecclesiastical Affairs of <HI>Habessinia,</HI> were then but in a Low Condition, there not having bin any Peace in the Country for about Fourscore years: so that perpetual Wars had almost extinguish'd the Studies of peaceful Arts; nor were there enough to perform Religious Duties in their Chur∣ches, but less to obviate the Encroachment of insinuating
<PB N="328" REF="155"/>
Errors and Abuses in Religion. The Metropolitans, Per∣sons for the most part the most ignorant that could be ima∣gin'd, took no more Cognizance of the Churches which they were appointed to govern, then if they had bin under Foreign Jurisdiction, only they took up their time in the Or∣dination of all sorts without any due Examination. There∣fore the King and his Nobility observing the Diligence of the <HI>Fathers</HI> in instructing the <HI>Habessine</HI> Youth; their Zeal in the Conversion of the People; their Eloquence in Preaching un∣heard of before, their Sanctity of living, so necessary among <HI>Neophytes</HI> and <HI>Proselytes,</HI> were possess'd with so much Admi∣ration and Affection toward them, that they could promise to themselves no other way for restoring their decay'd Eccle∣siastical Worship, but by their means. Therefore Letters were sent to the <HI>Pope</HI> and the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> to request their Friendship, and the Assistance of the <HI>Portugueses. Peter Pays</HI> enlarg'd upon the same Subject, and added much more con∣cerning the King's Affection to the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion. Fre∣quent Disputations also were appointed, of which the chief Theme was concerning the <HI>two Natures in Christ,</HI> which, be∣ing easily demonstrable out of the Writings of the <HI>Habessines</HI> themselves, gave the <HI>Fathers</HI> great Advantage over the <HI>Ethio∣pian</HI> Doctors.</P>
<P>The Chiefest of all the Nobility, <HI>Ras-Seelaxus</HI> the King's Brother by the Mother's side, publickly professed the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, and receiv'd the Eucharist openly, according to the <HI>Roman</HI> Manner, whose example many of the Great Com∣manders in the Army, both Collonels and Captains follow'd; especially seeing the King's favour so constant toward the <HI>Fa∣thers</HI> of the <HI>Society.</HI> At length the King himself, having re∣ceiv'd the Answer of <HI>Paul</HI> the V. in a Letter dated the 31 of <HI>January,</HI> 1623. <HI>Promis'd to yield him Obedience as Universal Pastor of the Church, and that he would admit a Patriarch sent from</HI> Rome, <HI>so that necessary Succors were sent him withal, without which, it was impossible to accomplish a business of so much Difficulty and Impor∣tance.</HI> He also signified his Intentions to send an Embassador with Father <HI>Antonio Fernandez,</HI> after another manner, and in another Equipage, then had yet bin usual. To say truth, the King publickly favour'd the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, without any opposition; in regard that the Sword had cut off the greatest part of the stiffest and most obstinate Defenders of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Worship. Only the <HI>Monks</HI> remain'd behind,
<PB N="329" REF="155"/>
who were baffled still in all their Attempts of Dispute. Therefore the King, to the end he might make it mani∣fest to his whole Kingdom, that he had not rashly, but upon Mature Deliberation, and as it were overcome by the force of Truth, given way to a new Religion, appointed a So∣lemn Dispute, where he enjoyn'd most of the Nobility of his Kingdom to be present. The Subject of the Disputation was again the repeated Question concerning the two Na∣tures in Christ; as if that had bin the utmost limit of all their Controversies. And no question it might be true what <HI>Tellez</HI> has written, that the <HI>Habessines</HI> were vanquish'd upon the first onset. For the reality of the thing supported by so many Authorities and Reasons afforded an easie Victory. Nevertheless there was another Dispute appointed some few days after, which prov'd no less successful than the for∣mer. Wherefore the King, as if the War had now bin at an end, and that now Truth had merited her Triumph, put forth an Edict, that all Persons for the future should believe and hold, <HI>That there were two Natures in Christ, between them∣selves really distinct, but united in one Divine Person.</HI> This Edict was little regarded by one particular <HI>Monk,</HI> more wilful and stubborn than truly zealous, who being for his Contumacy brought before the King, and speaking in his presence more irreverently than became him, was severely Scourg'd for his sawciness. Of the Pain and Anguish of which Chastisement, tho the Monk was only sensible, yet the fear of it kept others in awe, who not understanding that he was punish'd for his malapertness, thought he had bin so severely dealt with for denying the <HI>two Natures.</HI></P>
<P>These things being spread abroad, <HI>Simeon</HI> the Metropoli∣tan, at that time absent, hastens to the King with his Com∣plaints, <HI>That unusual things had bin done without his knowledge, and that Disputes about Religion had bin appointed in his absence.</HI> The King well understanding how unable he was to grapple with the Fathers in Dispute, made him answer, <HI>That since he was come, he would appoint the same Disputations to be heard over again.</HI> To which <HI>Simeon</HI> had not a word to say. And thus a second Victory being won from the Primate of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> him∣self, a more severe Edict concerning the <HI>two Natures</HI> was publish'd by the <HI>Cryer,</HI> making it Death for any Person to deny the contrary.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="156"/>By this so sharp a Decree, as if it had bin the loud signal to Battel, it is incredible to think how the minds of the Peo∣ple were incens'd. As for the Controversie it self, they did not think it of so high a Concernment, as to engage divid∣ed Parties in Blood and Massacre about it. <HI>In regard that all acknowledg'd both Divinity and Humanity in Christ; so that the Question was only about a word. But let the Question be what it would, such a severe way of proceeding was never heard of before in</HI> Ethiopia, <HI>as being altogether contradictory to the mildness of Christ and his Apostles, and the Lenity of the Primitive times. So then if Men were to be scourg'd and whipp'd, because they could not apprehend two Natures in Christ, what must they expect if other Questions should be started about Innovations of greater difficulty in the Doctrine and Ceremonies of the Fathers?</HI></P>
<P>Exasperated with these fair pretences, <HI>Simeon</HI> the Metro∣politan, together with several of the Nobility; and among the rest <HI>Jamanaxus,</HI> alias <HI>Emana Christos,</HI> another of the King's Brothers by the Mothers side; and lastly, almost all the In∣terested Clergy and Monks met, and held Consultations together to prevent the threatning Mischiefs; and lastly, combin'd <HI>to live and dye for the Defence of their ancient and settled Religion.</HI> To this end <HI>Simeon,</HI> under pretence of incumbent Duty, which was to be watchful over the Preservation of the <HI>Constantinopolitan</HI> Religion, fix'd an <HI>Excommunication</HI> Pub∣lickly upon the Dores of the great Church belonging to the Camp, against all that embrac'd the Religion of the <HI>Franks,</HI> or ventur'd to Dispute concerning it. The King, tho high∣ly offended with this unexpected boldness of the Metropoli∣tan, durst not adventure to revenge himself; However he Publish'd another Edict, <HI>whereby Liberty was granted to every Person that so pleas'd, to embrace and exercise the Fathers Reli∣gion already establish'd by fair Disputes and Arguments on their side.</HI> Which so little terrify'd the undaunted Metropolitan, that he thunder'd out his Anathema's against all that main∣tain'd <HI>two Natures in Christ.</HI></P>
<P>The Moderate Party bewail'd these Paper Skirmishes, which they foresaw would break forth, <HI>and end in Slaughter and Misery, and that the King's Decrees would never be establish'd without the effusion of much Blood.</HI> Sensible of these Fears, se∣veral of the great Personages of the Kingdom, together with the King's Mother, <HI>Ite-Hamelmala,</HI> most earnestly besought the King, to desist from what he had begun, and not to raise
<PB N="331" REF="156"/>
up implacable Seditions to the Ruin of himself and his King∣dom. After which the Metropolitan, with many Monks and Nuns came to the Camp, and implor'd the King, not to innovate any thing in Religion, otherwise that they were prepar'd to lay down their lives for the Religion of their Ancestors. At last the King referr'd the whole Business to a∣nother Colloquie, which continu'd for Six days one after another, but without any Success: A clear Testimony that Controversies in Religion are not to be decided by Disputes. After that, all the Clergy throw themselves at the King's Feet, and with Sighs and Tears beseech him, <HI>Not to change a Religion so quietly Establish'd in</HI> Ethiopia <HI>for so many Ages, by so many of their Emperors.</HI> But nothing would prevail; the King remain'd inexorable and immoveable; so that the Pe∣titioners departed full freighted with Exasperation and Re∣bellion. Immediately, all hopes of Concord and Agree∣ment being lay'd aside, the Sword was next unsheath'd, whence follow'd those terrible Commotions and Bloody Wars that have almost ruin'd the most flourishing part of <HI>Ethiopia.</HI></P>
<P>The Chief of the Conspirators were <HI>Jamanaxus, Aelius</HI> the King's Son in Law, Viceroy of <HI>Tigra,</HI> the Eunuch <HI>Caflo,</HI> and several others. But to give the better Colour to their Rebellion, and Design of Killing the King, the Metropoli∣tan, caus'd a new and more severe Excommunication to be fix'd upon the Chief Church in the Camp, by which all the partakers of the Latin Religion were Anathematiz'd. In the mean time the Fathers of the Society relying upon the King's Favour, hasten'd to get all things ready that might be of advantage to Establish their Doctrine. To that end they translated <HI>Maldonatus</HI> upon the Four Evangelists; <HI>Tole∣tus</HI> upon St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Epistle to the <HI>Romans, Ribera</HI> upon the <HI>He∣brews,</HI> and some others, into the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Language, which some esteem'd, others by reason of the intermixture of <HI>Am∣haric</HI> words, contemn'd, as full of Barbarisms and Soloecisms. But as for the Lord's Prayer, and the Salutation of <HI>Mary,</HI> be∣ing nothing but the Latin written in <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Characters, they abhorr'd 'em, as looking upon them to be nothing but Ma∣gic Spells. On the other side, the <HI>Alexandrians</HI> fell upon the Fathers with all the bitterest Invectives that might be; those Paper Skirmishes being generally the fore-runners of more Bloody disputes. In pursuance of which, <HI>Aelius</HI> by an
<PB N="332" REF="157"/>
Edict, Commands all the <HI>Franks</HI> to depart out of <HI>Tigra,</HI> and the <HI>Alexandrians</HI> to follow him: by which means, having muster'd up a compleat Army, he openly Rebels. <HI>Simeon</HI> Curses the <HI>Franks,</HI> but loads <HI>Aelius</HI> with his Blessings; upon which he no doubt relying, resolv'd to fight his Father in Law, then upon his March against him with a strong Force, notwithstanding all the Perswasions of his Wife to the con∣trary. Fierce therefore, and in the heat of his young Blood, and over-confident of his own Faction, not staying so much as to take his Breakfast, but as it were Drunk with Fury and Rage, only with a small Troop about him, he leaps his Horse into his Father's Camp, asking, <HI>Where the King was?</HI> and so what between the astonishment of some, and the wonder of others what the Matter should be, he rode up without any hurt to the King's Pavilion; where at length the Alarum being taken, he was soon surrounded, Ston'd and Stabb'd to Death, and so dearly paid for his rashness. The Captain thus Slain, the Soldiers betake themselves to their heels; <HI>Simeon,</HI> between the Fugitives and the Pursuers, stood alone by himself, like a man stupifyed, whether not at first observ'd, or neglected as a Clergy-man, but at length being known, he was Slain among the Crowd. Both their Heads were sent about the Kingdom, and expos'd as a Public Spectacle. The Eunuch <HI>Caflo</HI> had his Head struck off: <HI>Jamanaxus</HI> was pardon'd. Thus the Kindred of Kings for the most part escape the Punishment of those Rebel∣lions to which they themselves have given Life and Encou∣ragement.</P>
<P>The King who was never fearful, now more emboldened by his Victory, now questions other Heads of Religion: and soon after by Public Edict prohibits the Observation of the Sabbath, as <HI>Judaical,</HI> and Repugnant to Christianity. In answer to this Edict, some Person without a Name, had written contemptuously of the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, reflecting severely upon the Fathers of the Society, whom he call'd <HI>the Kindred of</HI> Pilate, as being a <HI>Roman,</HI> and withal sharply menacing the King himself. <HI>Tellez</HI> reports, That it was stufft with places of Scripture, but nothing to the purpose. The King more incens'd by this Writing, renew'd the Edict about the Sabbath, and commanded the Husbandmen to Plough and Sow upon that Day, adding as a Penalty upon the Offenders, for the first Fault the Forfeiture of a weav'd
<PB N="333" REF="157"/>
Vestment to the value of a <HI>Portugal</HI> Patack; for the second, Confiscation of Goods, and that the said Offence should not be prescribed to Seven years; a certain form usually in∣serted in their more severe Decrees.</P>
<P>Certainly it must of necessity be true what <HI>Tellez</HI> reports of the Natural Piety of the <HI>Habessines,</HI> since they were thus to be compell'd to the Neglect of the Sabbath by such Se∣vere Laws, when we can hardly be induc'd by stricter Pe∣nalties to observe the Lord's-Day. Among the rest, one <HI>Bu∣cus</HI> a stout and famous Soldier, felt the utmost rigour of this Decree, for being accus'd to have observ'd the Sabbath, he was made a most severe Example, that others of less conse∣quence might not think to expect any Mercy.</P>
<P>From thence <HI>Jonael</HI> Viceroy of <HI>Bagemdra</HI> took an occasion to Revolt, alluring all to his Party who were displeased with the Edicts. Upon which News, many of the chiefest of the Court, both Men and Women, of which several were near allyed to the King, with Tears in their Eyes besought him once more, not to expose himself and the Kingdom to Calamity, but to take Pity upon so many poor afflicted People, offend∣ing out of meer Simplicity and Ignorance, and not to disturb the Minds of his People with such unseasonable Changes.</P>
<P>The King far from being mov'd with their Tears, but rather the more displeas'd to see so many all of one Mind, that at once he might answer all, confirm the wa∣vering, and terrifie the Headstrong, having summon'd to∣gether the Chief Nobles and Commanders of his Army that attended the Court, in a short, but grave Oration, put them in mind of past Transactions, upbraiding them a∣mong the rest, <HI>For that they had depriv'd</HI> Zadenghel <HI>both of his Life and Kingdom, because he had forsaken the</HI> Alexandrian <HI>Religion to embrace the</HI> Roman <HI>Faith. That for his part, after his Victory obtain'd against</HI> Jacob, <HI>he had bin severe to none; but rather had pardon'd all; nevertheless he was disturb'd with daily Seditions and Rebellions, under pretence of changing his Reli∣gion, when he only reform'd it. For that he acknowledg'd as much and the same that others did, That</HI> Christ was true God, and true Man: <HI>but because he could not be Perfect God, unless he had the Perfect Divine Nature, nor perfect Man without perfect Humane Nature, it follow'd, that there were two Natures in Christ, uni∣ted in one Substance of the Eternal Word. Which was not to aban∣don but explain his Religion. In the next place he had abrogated
<PB N="334" REF="158"/>
the Observation of the Sabbath Day, because it became not</HI> Chri∣stians <HI>to observe the</HI> Jews <HI>Sabboth. These things he did not be∣lieve in favour of the</HI> Portugueses; <HI>but because it was the Truth it self determin'd in the Council of</HI> Chalcedon, <HI>founded upon Scripture, and ever since the time of the Apostles deliver'd as it were from hand to hand; and if there were occasion, he would lay down his life in defence of this Doctrine; but they who deny'd it should first examine the Truth of it.</HI></P>
<P>Having finished his Oration, a Letter was brought him from <HI>Jonael,</HI> containing many haughty Demands, and among the rest the Expulsion of the Jesuits. The King believing there would be no better way than to answer him in the Field, Commanded the nimblest of his Armed Bands to March: of which the Rebel having Intelligence, and not willing to abide his Fury fled for shelter among those in∣accessible Rocks, whither it was in vain to pursue him. Thereupon <HI>Susneus,</HI> well-knowing that the Revolters would not be able long to endure the Inconveniencies, and Fa∣mine that lodg'd among those inaccessible places, blockt him up at a Distance. So that <HI>Jonael</HI> at length, weaken'd by daily desertions, fled to the <HI>Gallans,</HI> who being at variance among themselves, kept their promis'd Faith but a short time; for being underhand tempted with Rewards by the King; they at length turn'd their Protection into Trea∣chery, and slew the Unfortunate Implorer of their Se∣curity.</P>
<P>This Bad Success however did not terrifie the Inhabitants of <HI>Damota,</HI> inhabiting the Southern parts of <HI>Gojam,</HI> who up∣on the News of the <HI>Prophanation of the Sabbath,</HI> as they called it, with their Hermites that sculk'd in the Deserts of that Province, ran to their Arms. <HI>Ras-Seelax,</HI> otherwise their Lord and Patron in vain Exhorting them to continue their Obedience, whose kind Messages of Peace and Pardon they refus'd, <HI>unless he would burn the Books Translated out of</HI> Latin <HI>into the</HI> Habessine <HI>Language by the Fathers, and deliver up the</HI> Fathers <HI>themselves to be Hang'd upon the highest Trees they could find.</HI> Thus despairing of Peace, <HI>Ras-Seelax</HI> set forward, tho deserted by the greatest part of his Forces, who favoured the Cause of their Countrymen; so that he had hardly Seven Thousand Men that stook close to him, while the Enemies Body daily encreas'd. However he resolv'd to Fight them, knowing his Soldiers to be more Experienc'd,
<PB N="335" REF="158"/>
and better Arm'd, besides that he had about Forty <HI>Portuguese</HI> Musquetiers in his Camp. When they came to blows, the Victory fell to the King's Party, tho it cost dear; in regard that about Four hundred Monks, that had as it were devoted themselves to die for their Religion, fought most desperate∣ly: of which a Hundred and fourscore were Slain.</P>
<P>Hitherto the King had not made Publick Profession of the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, partly out of fear of stirring up Popular Tumults against him; partly being loath to dismiss his Super∣numerary Wives, and Concubines; but at length encourag'd by so many Victories he lay'd all fear aside, and publickly renounc'd the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Worship, and confessing his Sins after the <HI>Roman</HI> manner to <HI>Peter Pays,</HI> dismiss'd all his Wives and Concubines, only the first of those to which he had bin lawfully Marry'd. His Example convinc'd many others, who were not asham'd to keep many Mistresses, but Adul∣tresses also. Not long after, the King signify'd his Conver∣sion to the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion to his whole Empire, by a Pub∣lick Instrument, not without the Severe reproof of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Patriarch. The sum of his <HI>Manifesto</HI> was, <HI>That having deserted the</HI> Alexandrinian, <HI>he now reverenced only the</HI> Roman <HI>See; and had yielded his Obedience to the</HI> Roman <HI>Pope, as the Successor of</HI> Peter, <HI>the Prince of the Apostles; for that that See could never err either in Faith or good Manners,</HI> and then he exhorted his Subjects to do as he had done. He also discoursed at large concerning the two Natures in Christ, and tax'd the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Primates as guilty of many Errors. But neither the King's Example, nor his Exhortation wrought upon many. For at the same time his Son <HI>Gabriel</HI> began to study new Con∣trivances, tho with no better Success than they who had taught him the way. For when he had intelligence that <HI>Ras-Seelax</HI> was marching against him, finding himself Infe∣rior in Force, he betook himself to the inaccessible Rocks of <HI>Shewa;</HI> from whence at last by the Craft of a certain well∣brib'd <HI>Gallan,</HI> he was allur'd to come forth; who feigning himself to be highly offended with <HI>Ras-Seelax,</HI> came to the unwary young Prince, and promis'd him the Assistance of all his Friends; which while he was inveagled out to expect, in a neighbouring Wood, he was there surrounded by a select Party of the Enemy, and pay'd for his rash belief with the loss of his Life.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> Of the Coming of the <HI>Roman</HI> Patriarch into <HI>Ha∣bessinia,</HI> and how he Managed his Affairs there.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Alphonsus Mendez</HI> made Patriarch of <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> His Inauguration and Journey to <HI>Goa,</HI> &amp;c. Their miserable Reception at first. His difficult Passage by Land. Met by the Jesuits. He comes to <HI>Fremona,</HI> thence to the King. The King swears Obedience to the Pope. So does the Court. <HI>Ras-Seelax</HI>'s behaviour blam'd. The Solemnity concluded with an Ana∣thema. New Edicts in favour of the Romish Worship. The Women Commanded to swear. The Patriarchal See. New Disturbances occa∣sion'd by the new Computation. Baptism and Ordination reiterated: Ser∣mons. Visitation and Confirmation. A Countryman's Joke. A Seminary. <HI>Tecla-George</HI> Revolts. Suppress'd and Hang'd. The Captain of the Guards excommunicated upon a slight Occasion by the Patriarch; but Pardon'd at the King's intercession. Their Courtiers offended. Their Indignation increases, and why. A Witch imprison'd by Command of the Patriarch: Which alienates the King's Affection from him. His Authority decreases, through private Grudges, and an Act of <HI>Ras Seelax.</HI> The <HI>Agawi</HI> Revolt. The King's ill Success. <HI>Ras-Seelax</HI> more Prosperous against <HI>Luca-Marjam. Kebax</HI> kill'd and <HI>Teker-Egzi.</HI> These Mischiefs attributed to the <HI>Ro∣mans. Melcax</HI> takes upon him the Regal Power. <HI>Ras Seelax</HI> accus'd; His Goods confiscated. The Fathers render'd odious to the King. Their In∣dulgencies laugh'd at. <HI>Serthax</HI>'s unhappy Revolt. A New Expedition against the <HI>Lasti,</HI> Prosperous at first, at last Ʋnfortunate. The Fathers tax'd. The King indulges the Old Ceremonies. The Patriarch offended. Another more mild Edict; but too late.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>OF These prosperous Successes, the Fathers wrote presently to <HI>Rome,</HI> and into <HI>Portugal.</HI> But very prudently, there was nothing rashly decreed at first, lest the Design of another Patriarch, like that of <HI>No∣nius Barret</HI> should come to nothing. But when King <HI>Sus∣neus</HI> himself, had by his own Letters requested a Patriarch, and had made publick Profession of the <HI>Romish</HI> Religion, the Conclave then thought it not expedient to make any longer delays. And therefore, as if they had bin to send into some <HI>Portuguese</HI> Province, upon the Nomination of <HI>Philip</HI> the Fourth, then King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> as well as <HI>Spain, Alphonsus Mendez,</HI> a Person of great Eminency, by Nativity a <HI>Portu∣guese,</HI> a Doctor in Theology, and of the Society of <HI>Jesus,</HI> which claim'd <HI>Ethiopia</HI> peculiarly to it self, as a Province by them wholly converted to the Faith, was created Patriarch.
<PB N="337" REF="159"/>
Besides, that it might have occasion'd great Emulation, had a Person bin chosen out of any other Nation or Society. Being inaugurated with the usual Ceremonies, at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> in the Month of <HI>May</HI> 1624. he set Sail, and arriv'd at <HI>Goa,</HI> where understanding that all things succeeded to the wishes of the <HI>Fathers,</HI> he prepar'd for his farther Journey. In <HI>No∣vember</HI> of the same year he arriv'd at <HI>Dios,</HI> hoping there to find some of the <HI>Bannian</HI> Vessels, to carry him into the <HI>Red-Sea:</HI> But they being the year before over-burthen'd by the covetous Exactions of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and fearing the <HI>Arabian</HI> Pirates had left off Trading into those Parts. While he stay'd at <HI>Dio,</HI> he was seasonably forewarn'd by the King's Letters, by no means to come near <HI>Suaqena</HI> or <HI>Matzua,</HI> but to make to rights for <HI>Baylur</HI> a Port of <HI>Dancala.</HI> There he arriv'd the Third of <HI>April</HI> following with six Companions, four <HI>Fathers;</HI> and two Friers.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P>The King had recommended him to the care of the Vice∣roy of <HI>Dancala,</HI> a Mahometan, but in Friendship with the <HI>Habessines.</HI> But the recommendation was so early, and he
<PB N="338" REF="160"/>
came so late, that the Viceroy had forgot it. So that his Reception there was very lamentable, there being little or no Provision, so much as of Necessaries made for him. And their Hosts where they Lodg'd, were so poor and cove∣tous, that instead of receiving any Kindnesses from them, they were forc'd to purchase their sorry Convenience with the continual Supplies of their Avarice. They could not get Mules or Horses anow to carry themselves and their Luggage; so that most of them were forc'd to travel over the rugged and parch'd Earth in continual conflict with hun∣ger, thirst, and intolerable heat.</P>
<P>Neither were they much better entertain'd for Sixteen days in the Court of the Viceroy himself, all their Presents not sufficing to gratifie the impatient Appetite of his Avarice. Parting from thence, at the Mercy of those wicked and co∣vetous Varlets that were their Guides and Owners of their Carriage-Horses, they travel'd as they were led, in daily fear of the <HI>Gallans,</HI> over places where Battels had bin fought, as it were Pav'd with the Skulls and Bones of the Slain, till at last all these Difficulties and Dangers overcome, they were met by <HI>Emanuel Barradas,</HI> with some other <HI>Portugueses</HI> and <HI>Habessines</HI> upon the Confines of <HI>Tigra,</HI> who furnish'd them with Provisions, Carriages, and all other things necessary. Upon the strength of which Refreshments, they began to ascend the towring Mountains of <HI>Abassia,</HI> and the Fifth day after, through more gladsom and verdant Fields, and more grateful opportunities of resting themselves, they arriv'd at <HI>Fremona;</HI> where they stay'd not only all the Winter, but all <HI>October</HI> and <HI>November,</HI> being both unhealthy Months. In <HI>December</HI> they arriv'd at <HI>Gorgora,</HI> where upon a day appoint∣ed, with a Noble Attendance, and great Applause, the Pa∣triarch enter'd the Camp, and after Mass said, was condu∣cted into the King's Pavillion, and there by the King Com∣manded to sit down by him in a little Chair equal to his own. In which great Pomp and State, at length the Patriarch came to the point, and agreed with the King, that upon the XI day of <HI>February,</HI> 1626. he should publickly swear Obedience to the Pope.</P>
<P>Upon which day, together with the King and his Eldest Son <HI>Basilides,</HI> appear'd the King's Brothers, the Viceroys and Governors of Provinces, and all others that were conspicuous for their Dignity and Quality. In the Room were two
<PB N="339" REF="160"/>
little Chairs, but very rich, set one by the other; upon which the King sate down on the right hand, and the Patri∣arch in his Pontifical habit upon the left. Being so sate, the Patriarch made a most lofty Panegyric in Praise of the Pope, not without some Reflections upon the Blindness of former Ages: then he fell to commemorate what had been done of later Times, How, <HI>That the Emperors of</HI> Habessinia <HI>had sent their Embassadors formerly to</HI> Rome, <HI>and that lately one of them had requested thence a Pastor, and Evangelical Preachers: that therefore now the Time was come, wherein his Majesty was bound to satisfie the desire of his Ancestors, and to submit himself and his Subjects to the See of</HI> Rome. The King Commanded the Grand Chamberlain of his Houshold <HI>Melca Christos,</HI> Prince of <HI>Samena</HI> to return an Answer; who after he had extoll'd the Merits of the <HI>Portugueses, It is now the King's Intention,</HI> said he, <HI>to fulfil the Promises of his Ancestors, by yielding Obedience to the</HI> Roman <HI>Pope;</HI> But as he was going on, the King interrupted him, saying, <HI>That this was not the first day of his Intention to sur∣render his submission to the</HI> Roman <HI>Pope, as having long before promis'd it to the Superior Father of the Society of</HI> Jesus. Present∣ly the Patriarch after a short answer, unfolded a Book con∣taining the four Evangelists; and then the King falling upon his Knees, took his Oath after this manner:</P>
<P><HI>We</HI> Sultan-Saghed <HI>King of the Kings of</HI> Ethiopia, <HI>believe and confess, That St.</HI> Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, <HI>Prince of the Apostles was by Christ our Lord, Constituted Head of the whole Christian Church, and that Principality and Power over the whole World was given to him when he said,</HI> Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock will I build my Church, and I will give to thee the Keys of Heav'n; <HI>and at another Time when he said to Him,</HI> Feed my Sheep. <HI>In like manner we believe, That the Pope of</HI> Rome <HI>lawfully Elected, is the true Successor of St.</HI> Peter <HI>the Apostle, in his Government, and that he has the same Power, Dignity, and Primacy of the whole Church of Christ. Therefore we Promise, Offer, and Swear true Obedience, and humbly submit our Person and our Empire, at the feet of our Holy Father</HI> Urban <HI>the</HI> VIII. <HI>of that Name, by the Grace of God Pope, and our Lord, and to his Successors in the Administration of the Church. So God help us, and these Holy Evangils.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="161"/>After the King had done, his Son <HI>Basilides,</HI> the King's Brothers, all the Viceroys and Peers; as also all the Clergy and Monks then present took the same Oath.</P>
<P>After this, <HI>Ras-Seelax,</HI> hastily Drawing forth his Scimi∣ter, brake forth into these passionate Expressions: <HI>What is done, let it be done;</HI> that is to say, Let past things be forgotten; <HI>But whoever for the future shall not do it, since it becomes every one so to do, shall feel the weight of this.</HI> An Act, which to most that were present, seem'd very severe, especially to those who had taken part with <HI>Gabriel,</HI> at whom those words were constru'd to be principally levell'd. Moreover, he added an unusual Clause to his own Oath; <HI>That he also swore Allegiance to</HI> Basilides <HI>as Heir and Successor to his Father; and that he would also be his faithful Vassal, so that he would promise to Protect and Defend the Holy Catholic Faith; otherwise that he would be the first and most profess'd of his Enemies.</HI> As if it had bin lawful for a Subject to impose new Conditions of his Subjection upon a most Absolute Prince and Monarch, not bound by any Laws of Man, such as is the King of <HI>Ha∣bessinia.</HI> However the King said nothing, nor durst <HI>Basilides,</HI> as being under the Tuition of his Father, take notice of it. Nor indeed was this Condition added to his Oath, any advan∣tage to the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, but rather serv'd to hasten the Ruin of <HI>Ras-Seelax.</HI> This Solemnity concluded with an Anathema, after the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> manner, upon all those that for the future should forget or break this Oath. Immediately after, several Edicts were Publish'd, <HI>That none for the future should say Mass, or Exercise the Priestly Office, except such as were licens'd by the Patriarch.</HI> Thereupon, the Ordinations of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Metropolitan not being accompted lawful, most of the Priests were constrain'd to receive new Ordinations from the new Patriarch, upon this Condition, <HI>That they should all observe the</HI> Roman <HI>Forms of Worship, and not give any succour or harbour to Rebels; who offended in that Nature was to be severely punish'd.</HI> It was also farther enjoyn'd that in the Celebration of <HI>Easter,</HI> and Observation of <HI>Lent,</HI> the Canons of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> should be faithfully follow'd. There was also one thing more than usual exacted by the Patriarch, who having a great mistrust of the Ladies of the Royal Blood, caus'd a <NOTE PLACE="foot">It is still a Proverb among the <HI>Ethiopians, Zaqon Qawino,</HI> What is done, let it be done.</NOTE>
<PB N="341" REF="161"/>
Decree to be made, that they also upon a prefix'd day, as being more zealous for the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Opinions than the Men, should take the Sacred Oath of Supremacy to the Pope, as if they had bin a distinct Body Politic from the Men. But whether it were put in Execution, or how done I do not find.</P>
<P>In the next place, great care was taken for Building a Pa∣triarchal Seat, and for settling an Annual Revenue for sup∣port of the Dignity of the new Primate; to which purpose a place was chosen out in the Confines of <HI>Bagemdra,</HI> and <HI>Dem∣bea,</HI> call'd <HI>Debsan;</HI> as also another in the Imperial Camp near <HI>Dancaz. Residencies</HI> also for the Fathers were built in several Provinces of the Empire to stock it with Jesuits.</P>

<P>The same year also <HI>Lent</HI> was kept after the <HI>Roman</HI> manner, with all the Solemnities of the Passion Week, as also <HI>Easter</HI> ac∣cording to the <HI>Roman</HI> Calendar. Which occasion'd most vio∣lent Commotions over all the Empire, and more especially among the Clergy and Monks. Who being ignorant of the Computation and the Cause, thought it a high breach of the Canons of the <HI>Nicene Council,</HI> and the <HI>Paschal Cycle</HI> therein prescrib'd. Neither could the Edict be equally dispers'd over so many far distant Regions for want of Printing.</P>
<P>In the mean time they were very busie in Baptizing the Converted, and ordaining of Ecclesiastical Persons, many of which had bin already Baptiz'd and Ordain'd. Sermons were also Preach'd in several places after the manner of <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> wherein it was necessary for the Fathers to Cite many places of Scripture, if they desir'd to be accompted Learned.
<PB N="342" REF="162"/>
Thus the Fathers of the Society made a daily and very great Progress, insomuch that the Number of Baptiz'd and Converted to the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion amounted to many Thousands.</P>
<P>About two years after, the Patriarch made a Visitation assisted by some of the Sodality, in which vast Numbers of People were some of them Rebaptiz'd, others Con∣firm'd; to the great good-liking and applause of the King and his Peers, who had never seen such things perform'd by any of their Metropolitans before. Others look'd asquint upon these prosperous beginnings, seeking all Occasions of new Disturbances. Some there were that openly resisted, and would not permit any Priest under <HI>Roman</HI> Ordination to officiate in their Churches, nay some of them they kill'd out-right. As for the Countrey People, tho they were pas∣sively Obedient to the King's Commands, yet they lik'd their own old way best. Among the rest there was one, who having receiv'd the Cuff of Confirmation, as their manner is, and being ask'd by his Neighbour how he did? <HI>Never worse,</HI> said He, <HI>than I have bin since I receiv'd the Patriarch's Box o'th' ear.</HI></P>
<P>More than all this, there was a <HI>Seminary</HI> set up, for the Education as well of the <HI>Habessine</HI> as <HI>Portuguese</HI> Children: for the Encouragement of whom, and to invite others, they caus'd some of the young Lads to Act a Comedy after the <HI>European</HI> manner. But when they brought in Devils upon the Stage, as the Scene requir'd, some of the ignorant Peo∣ple, believing them real Hobgoblins, were so terrify'd, that they flung out of the School, crying out, <HI>Wajelan, Wa∣jelan, Sajetanet ametzea: O Dear! O Dear! they have brought us Devils.</HI></P>
<P>But the ensuing Tragedies more terrify'd the wiser sort. For <HI>Tecla-George,</HI> another of the King's Sons in Law, for his Wives sake, at difference with his Father, having drawn in∣to the same Conspiracy with him two Noblemen, <HI>Gebra-Marjam,</HI> and <HI>John Acayo,</HI> revolted openly, and by a Cryer solemnly proclaim'd, <HI>That he renounc'd the</HI> Roman <HI>Worship, and would Protect the</HI> Alexandrian <HI>by force of Arms.</HI> And that the world might believe he was in Earnest, he caus'd all the Crucifixes, Rosaries, and other Ornaments of Popish Super∣stition to be burnt in a publick fire; and to the end there might be no hopes of Reconciliation left for the Expectation
<PB N="343" REF="162"/>
of Confederates, he took his Chaplain <HI>Abba Jacob;</HI> who offi∣ciated after the <HI>Roman</HI> manner, and after he had dispoyl'd him of his Stole and Hood, put him to Death.</P>
<P>The King could not brook so great an Indignity, and there∣fore sent <HI>Kebax,</HI> Viceroy of <HI>Tigra,</HI> with an Army against him, who us'd such extraordinary Diligence, that he soon sur∣priz'd the secure and unprovided Rebel, overthrew his Army, and took him and his Sister <HI>Adera</HI> Prisoners: who, because they had so furiously and contemptuously acted against the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, were both hang'd upon a high Tree. Nor could all the Intercessions of the Queen, nor of all the Noble Ladies could prevail, tho they pleaded hard the disgrace done to their Sex, and that it was never before known in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> that a Noblewoman was Hang'd: especially being call'd by the King to behold so sad and infamous a Spectacle. For they did not pity her because they thought her Innocent, but for the Ignominy of her Punishment.</P>
<P>After this follow'd several other Accidents, which as they brought a very great Odium upon the Patriarch and the Fa∣thers, so were they reckn'd to be the Causes of the general aversness of the People to the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion. The Patri∣arch, that he might exercise all his Authority in one single Act, and shew the full extent of his Power, having taken a pett against the Captain of the King's Guards, for some fri∣volous Business that nothing belong'd to his Jurisdiction, publickly in the Church, in the presence of the whole Court, thunders out an Anathema against him, and sent him Post to the Devil. It seems he had taken Possession of certain Farms, which the Monks lay'd claim to, and refus'd to restore them, notwithstanding all the Admonitions of the Patriarch. The Nobleman, tho a Soldier, hearing such a most Dreadful Ex∣communication, by vertue whereof he was sent packing to Hell, laden with all the Curses of <HI>Dathan</HI> and <HI>Abiram,</HI> like one Thunder-strook, fell into a Sound, and lay for Dead. But the Storm did not continue long: For presently the King stept in to his relief, by whose interposition, and the Media∣tion of several of the Nobility, he was re-admitted into the state of Grace. However it was an Act which the Nobility took most heinously to heart; among whom there were some that frown'd and chaf'd out of meer Indignation, to see that their Church should be brought to such a degree of Ser∣vitude, that a Foreign Priest should take upon him with so
<PB N="344" REF="163"/>
much Arrogance to Excommunicate and Bequeath to Eternal Damnation, one of the Chief Counsellors of their King∣dom, an Ancient and Famous Personage, for the sake of a Litigious Farm, which the King might take when he pleas'd from the Monks themselves, if they were the Owners.</P>
<P>This Flame was fed by the addition of more fuel; For the <HI>Icegue</HI> or Chief Abbot of the Monks being at that time lately Deceas'd, who as we have already said, is the next in Dignity and Authority to the <HI>Abuna,</HI> he was Buried in a cer∣tain Church, consecrated after the <HI>Roman</HI> manner, tho he had bin an obstinate Zealot for the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Religion. Thereupon the Patriarch, after he had soundly reprov'd the Rector of the Church, <HI>Pronounc'd the Church profan'd by the Burial of a Heretic; and therefore that Mass could not be said in it.</HI> The Rector dreading the fatal stroak of the same dismal <HI>Da∣than</HI> and <HI>Abiram</HI> Thunderbolt, that lay'd the Great Comman∣der sprawling, without expecting any new Command, causes the Carkass to be digg'd up again, and thrown by. This the <HI>Habessines</HI> heavily exclaim'd against, crying out, <HI>That the</HI> Franks <HI>exercised more cruel Severities upon them, then their most ex∣asperated Enemies ever practis'd among them, to deprive their Dead of decent Burial: now they might all see what the Living were to expect. Tellez</HI> adds, That a certain old Woman was cast into Prison, upon Suspition of being a Witch, but was pre∣sently set at liberty, because it gave distaste. For that the most Learned of the <HI>Habessines</HI> are of Opinion, <HI>That there are now no more Magicians or Witches in the World; and therefore that the Woman was unjustly wrong'd, who was thrown into Prison by the Command of the Patriarch.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Minds of the People being generally incens'd, the King himself began to look upon these acts of separate Jurisdiction in the Patriarch, as Diminutions of his Prero∣gative (the ancient Metropolitans never daring to attempt such things), and consequently to alienate his Affections both from him and from the <HI>Fathers,</HI> so that at length he gave ear to their Adversaries. Who to bring down and curb the Excessive Power of the Patriarch, which seem'd so into∣lerable to them, more especially because they found him still inexorable in Matrimonial Causes, prohibited by Divine and Canon-Law; but chiefly in cases of Polygamy and Divorce; they began their Addresses to him for those things, which
<PB N="345" REF="163"/>
they knew he could not deny without bringing great mis∣chief upon himself. First, <HI>That they might have liberty to say Mass after the ancient</HI> Ethiopian <HI>manner; for that the Patriarch might mend the ancient forms, where Necessity requir'd, without abrogating the whole. That the People hearing their ancient Ser∣vices, would be the more quiet, in regard they would not so much mind the difference between the New and the Ancient form of Worship.</HI> The Patriarch gave way to their desires, only mending the Ethiopic Mass, but with apparent Detriment to his Authori∣ty. For now the ancient Liturgies were every day read again without Contradiction; the Report running abroad that the Emperor was return'd to the Old Religion. The Patriarch's Power thus shaken, the Courtiers still whisper'd in the King's Ears, <HI>That the</HI> Roman <HI>Religion was become odious to all the People, and that his Person would be in great Danger, un∣less he also forsook it himself.</HI></P>
<P>These Insinuations were back't by an Accident, which tho ridiculous in it self, gave a <HI>being</HI> to several Rumors and Reports. For one day an Enthusiast came into the Palace, and cry'd out, That he was sent from God and the most Ho∣ly Virgin, to declare in their own words to the <HI>King, that unless he forthwith return'd to the antient Religion, he should with∣in a Fortnight undergo most severe Chastisements.</HI> The King made answer, <HI>That he would live and die in the</HI> Roman <HI>Religion:</HI> and that the Messenger might the more speedily return his answer, <HI>Commanded him to be Hang'd.</HI> But at the Intercession of several who asserted the poor Fellow to be Frantick, he only receiv'd a severe drubbing, for the reward of his sawcy Prophesie. Howevet tho he were laugh'd at by the Cour∣tiers, yet he so strangely stirr'd the minds of the Vulgar, that they publickly reported, <HI>That an Angel had bin sent from Hea∣ven, and that he had admonish'd the King to return to the ancient</HI> Alexandrian <HI>Faith.</HI> In the mean while the inbred hatred against the Fathers daily increasing, was greatly augmented by the envy of the Courtiers. For they incens'd the King and his Eldest Son against <HI>Ras-Seelax,</HI> the Fathers chief Friend, and Patron of the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> under pretence of their great care, admonshing the two Princes, <HI>To take heed that he did not abuse the Renown he had won in War, and the favour of the</HI> Portugueses, <HI>to invade the Royal Dignity.</HI> That which more heighten'd these growing Jealousies, was a misinterpreted act of <HI>Ras-Seelax,</HI> who having order'd one <HI>Lecanax</HI> to be ap∣prehended
<PB N="346" REF="164"/>
for Calumnies and Scandalous Reports thrown upon himself, caus'd him afterwards to be put to Death, tho he had appeal'd to the King. This they said was done by <HI>Seelax,</HI> not that the Person was guilty of the Crimes which were lay'd to his Charge, but to remove out of the way one that was Privy to the Treasons and Conspiracies of <HI>See∣lax.</HI> Whereupon the King depriv'd him instantly of great part of his Lands, remov'd him out of <HI>Gojam,</HI> and took from him his Military Commands.</P>
<P>In the mean time, tho <HI>Tecla-George</HI> had suffer'd, and that the Heads of the Rebellion were taken off, yet the Rebellion it self continu'd, and the strength of it daily increas'd in such manner, that it became the Original of Dismal and Diutur∣nal Commotions. For the <HI>Agawi,</HI> that inhabit the Moun∣tains of <HI>Bagemdra,</HI> had not yet lay'd down their Arms; but being, as they pretended, more and more provok'd by-the King, kept them in their hands to revenge their Injuries. And the better to defend themselves, they call'd to their Aid, one <HI>Melcax,</HI> a young Man of the Royal Blood, who had bin bred among the <HI>Gallans,</HI> and created him their Lea∣der. To him therefore, as to a Sanctuary, flock'd all those that bare any disaffection to the King, all that hated the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Religion, especially the Monks; and lastly, several of the Villagers and Country People. All these thus embody'd, were call'd <HI>Lasteners,</HI> from <HI>Lasta,</HI> a most invincible Rock, and the chief Seat of the Rebellion. And indeed it seem'd a vast Torrent of War, ready to break forth to the utter Ex∣tirpation of the Fathers, and all those of the <HI>Roman</HI> Reli∣gion, if it prov'd so kind to spare the Royal Family it self. Against these therefore the King, having rais'd an Army of Seven and twenty Thousand Men, marches himself in Per∣son, but with ill success at first. For the Country People, defended by the Security of the place, as the Royalists came on, still beat them off, by rolling down whole Quarries at a time of ponderous Stones upon their heads, which having put the Royalists into great disorder, they came down, and sur∣rounded all the King's Left Wing, so that had not <HI>Kebax</HI> come to their relief with 300 fresh Men, they had bin all cut to pieces. The Soldiers being discourag'd by this over∣throw, the King who for that reason durst not adventure any further for that time, left part of his Army to defend the Borders, and hast'ning home, was forc'd to recall <HI>See-lax,</HI>
<PB N="347" REF="164"/>
lurking like an Exile in <HI>Gojam.</HI> In the mean time the Tute∣lar Bands, whether for fear, or finding themselves too weak, forsook their Posts, so that the <HI>Lastaneers</HI> ravag'd all the Country as they pleas'd, without Opposition, till <HI>Seelax</HI> be∣ing got within their reach, drave them back into their for∣mer Holes.</P>
<P>While this Rebellion rag'd in <HI>Bagemdra,</HI> another broke out in <HI>Amhara;</HI> being headed by <HI>Luca-Marjam,</HI> near in Blood to the Royal Family; but he being prevented and surpriz'd by the swift March of <HI>Ras-Seelax,</HI> ended his Days and his Design together, by falling from the Precipice of a Rock.</P>
<P>But the same good Fortune did not attend <HI>Kebax,</HI> who impatient of delay, and observing the Avenues more negli∣gently guarded than they us'd to be, the bait that betray'd him, conceiv'd no less than that <HI>Opportunity</HI> it self had now proffer'd him the Victory. So in he marches, finding all clear before him for the present; but no sooner was he in, when those Mountaneers accustom'd to clamber their own Rocks, and us'd to the By-ways and conceal'd Passages of that Rock, were all on a sudden before and behind him; so that after a great Slaughter of his Men, deserted by the rest, he was himself after a matchless defence, oppress'd by Multi∣tudes, and Slain.</P>
<P>His, and the Fall of <HI>Tegur-Egzi,</HI> which soon after fol∣low'd, gave the Fathers no cause of Thanksgivings, but af∣forded their Enemies great Opportunities, and great Argu∣ments to press the King to withdraw his Favours from them. For observing their time, when they perceiv'd him sad, and perplex'd at so much ill Success, and so many Revolts, <HI>Oh Sir,</HI> said they, <HI>What will be the Issue of all these Combats and pernicious Wars? Those illiterate Swains understand not the Myste∣ries of the</HI> Roman <HI>Worship, nor any other Service of God then what they have bin bred and brought up to. They call us</HI> Turks <HI>and</HI> Mahumetans, <HI>because we have abandon'd our ancient Litur∣gies; for this reason they have taken Arms, and chosen to them∣selves a King.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>Melcax,</HI> pufft up with the Success of his Affairs, was arriv'd at that height of boldness, that nothing now would serve him but the assum'd Title of a King. He had distri∣buted his Court-Employments after the manner of the Kings of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> among his Friends; and daily increas'd in Num∣ber.
<PB N="348" REF="165"/>
For all that abominated the <HI>Fathers,</HI> chiefly the No∣bility of <HI>Tigra,</HI> privately gave him Encouragements, and exhorted him, <HI>not to desist from what he had so prosperously begun; and that then, neither the Affections of the People, nor the Assistance of his Friends would be wanting.</HI> Elated with these golden Promises, his Temerity carry'd him so far, as to send, as if he had now bin the undoubted King of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> a Vice∣roy into <HI>Tigra.</HI> To this Viceroy he allow'd a Select Band of Soldiers for his Convoy; but they, neglectful and care∣less of their Military Duties, took their Pleasure so much, that at length surpriz'd in the midst of their Jollity by the Royalists, they were forc'd to leave Four thousand of their Party behind them, Slain upon the Spot; while the shatter'd Remainders speeded back, to lay the blame of their ill Suc∣cess upon the unwary Conduct of their Leaders. But the <HI>Lastaneers,</HI> intent upon revenge, had at length the same ad∣vantage against the Royalists, who were stragling to destroy the approaching Harvest, and pay'd them home with equal Slaughter for Slaughter. Thus Fortune ballancing both sides, the Author of these Miscarriages was enquir'd after, and as soon found by those that watched their Opportunities. For presently <HI>Ras-Seelax</HI> was accus'd, as if he had bin negligent in Executing the King's Orders, and had not sent timely Succors to the over-power'd Combatants. And his Enemies so far prevail'd, that Articles were fram'd against him, to which he was compell'd to answer: which he did, and justify'd himself so well, that in words indeed he was acquitted, but in Fact condemn'd. For he was again de∣graded, and all his feudary Possessions and Military Employ∣ments granted away to <HI>Basilides.</HI></P>
<P>Thus <HI>Ras-Seelax</HI> being once more lay'd by, it was no diffi∣cult matter to undermine the Patriarch and the Fathers. For against them the general Complaint was made, <HI>That they had no other Design, but as they had subjected the Empire in Ecclesiasti∣cal Affairs to the</HI> Roman <HI>Pope, so to bring it under the Dominion of the King of</HI> Portugal <HI>in Seculars. To this end under the pretence of Temples and Residencies they rear'd up Castles and Walls, from whence they could never be expell'd with Spears and Arrows.</HI> Many other things of the same Nature, they suggested, which if the King now through Age more jealous, did not absolutely believe, yet he hearken'd to them with a more easie Attention. However outwardly and publick he shew'd
<PB N="349" REF="165"/>
the same Kindness and Affability to the Fathers as before, and kindly receiv'd the Bishop sent from <HI>Rome</HI> to be a Coadjutor to the Patriarch. But when he brought the <HI>Diploma</HI>'s of the Jubilee open'd at <HI>Rome</HI> in the year 1625. and then granted to <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> he was derided by most Men, who could not comprehend those great Vertues of Indulgencies which the Bishop boasted of. For some began to Discourse among themselves like the Pharisees, <HI>Who is this who also forgives Sins? Who can forgive Sins but only God?</HI> To which the King made answer with a severe Countenance, <HI>That the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven were given to</HI> Peter, <HI>and that the use of those Keys belong'd to the Pope, for the Granting Indul∣gencies.</HI></P>
<P>However the <HI>Habessines,</HI> as if those Indulgencies had afforded Materials for Sin, bent themselves still more and more to Sedition and Tumult. For the Revolt of the <HI>La∣staneers</HI> so well succeeding, <HI>Sertzazax,</HI> newly made Viceroy of <HI>Gojam,</HI> so ill repay'd the King for his new favours, that he not only revolted from him himself; but which was more detestable to think, he would have drawn in the young <HI>Basilides</HI> to have conspir'd with him against his own Father. And when he could not prevail upon the young Prince, he endeavour'd to have advanc'd another young Noble Gentleman of the Blood Royal, to the end he might have reign'd himself under his Name. But being over∣thrown and taken, he was drubb'd to Death. Seven of his Accomplices lost their Heads. One of his chief Agents, because he had vented horrid Blasphemies against the See of <HI>Rome,</HI> and opprobrious words against the King, was hung up upon an Iron Hook driven into a high Stake; upon which, after he had hung a whole Day, because he repeated the same Provocations in the midst of his Torment, he was at length run thorough the Body with several Spears; and so ended his miserable Life. So many, and such lamentable Accidents as these pierc'd the very hearts of most People, and the <HI>Lastaneers,</HI> dispairing of Pardon, hearing of such horrid Executions, were the more resolute in their Re∣bellion.</P>
<P>Thereupon the King undertook a new Expedition with all his Forces against them, and had taken the very Head and Ring-leader of all the Rebels, had he not with a small Reti∣nue made a shift to Escape; yet he left behind him great
<PB N="350" REF="166"/>
store of rich Plunder. But he could not be utterly Subdu'd, in regard that so many Sculking Holes, so many wide and spacious Rocks, where those Savages liv'd and hid them∣selves, like so many wild Beasts, could neither be assail'd nor taken. It happen'd therefore, that Fortune wheeling about, the Rebels overthrew a Select Party of the King's Forces: and by and by with all their force lay hovering about the King's Army, which they foresaw would in a short time want Provision. The King therefore fearing to be clos'd up in those narrow Streights, retir'd into <HI>Dembea,</HI> before the War was at an end. Which he did with so much hast more then it was thought he needed to have done, that as it diminish'd his own fame, so it gave Courage to the Rebels.</P>
<P>And now the Fathers great Enemies beholding the King's Melancholly, redoubled their Complaints. <HI>That there would never be peaceful Days in</HI> Ethiopia, <HI>so long as the</HI> Roman <HI>Reli∣gion bare so much sway. That it was a very good Religion, but above the Capacity of the People, who would still prefer the Wor∣ship of their Ancestors, to which they had bin bred from their In∣fancy, before foreign Innovations, which they understood not. For who should perswade them,</HI> That Circumcision was evil, That the Holydaies of the Sabbath are not pleasing to God; that the ancient Liturgy cannot be prov'd, That the <HI>Roman</HI> Ca∣lendar is better then the <HI>Ethiopic;</HI> That the Fasts of the Fourth Holyday are less acceptable to God, then the Fasts of the Seventh? <HI>How much more expedient and profitable were it, to retain the ancient Ceremonies in such things as do not contradict the Substance of Faith? But as for</HI> Ras-Seelax, <HI>and others that endeavour the Contrary, it was apparent they did it meerly to advance their own Designs against the King and Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>With these and such like Expostulations, the King being overcome, especially finding no other way of appeasing and quietting the <HI>Lasteneers,</HI> and that <HI>Bagemdra</HI> was almost all in the Hands of the Enemy, and at the same time all his Friends, especially the Ladies of Quality laying before him the Danger he would be in, should he be deserted by his Sol∣diers, he at length press'd the Patriarch, to remit whatever possibly might be remitted. He foreseeing a terrible Storm, tho sore against his Will, thought 'twas high time to lower his Sails, for fear of Losing all, while he hazarded the Saving of all. Whereupon he submitted to the King's request; never∣theless
<PB N="351" REF="166"/>
upon Condition, <HI>That nothing Decreed should be remitted by Publick Acts, but only by a Tacit Connivance, and that in the mean time there should be a Cessation of all Penalties, and Mulcts.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this the King intending a Third Expedition against the <HI>Lasteneers,</HI> to make his Soldiers the more stedfast and obe∣dient, he put forth an Edict; by which, in general words an Indulgence was granted for the Exercise of all ancient Ceremonies, not repugnant to Faith. Thus every Person being left to his particular Liberty, the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Worship was again, to the great Satisfaction of the People, freely ex∣ercis'd; but to the great grief of the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> especially the Patriarch, who presently wrote to the King, complain∣ing, <HI>That contrary to his advice, a Lay Prince should publish an E∣dict of that Nature in reference to spiritual Affairs:</HI> for that it belong'd to him to set forth such Decrees; putting him in mind of the words of <HI>Azariah</HI> the High-Priest to King <HI>Uzziah,</HI> and of the Punishment that follow'd, and admonishing him to amend that Fault, by publishing some other Edict, which should be propos'd by the assistance of some one of the Fa∣thers of the Society. The King obey'd and propounded an Edict, which contain'd Three Articles.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>That the Ancient Liturgy, but Corrected, should be read in the Mass.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>That the Festivals should be observ'd according to the ancient Computation of Time, except</HI> Easter, <HI>and those other Festivals that depended upon it.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>That whosoever pleas'd, instead of the Sabbath, might fast upon the fourth Holyday.</HI> And then as for answer to the Patri∣archs Complaints, he made this reply, <HI>That the</HI> Roman <HI>Reli∣gion was not introduc'd into his Dominions by the Preaching or Mira∣cles of the Fathers, but meerly by his Edicts and Commands, not by the assent of his People, but of his own free will, because he thought it better then the</HI> Alexandrian. <HI>Therefore the Patriarch had no rea∣son to Complain.</HI> But these Concessions not being sufficient, and coming too late, prov'd altogether ineffectual; not serving in the least to pacifie the <HI>Lasteneers,</HI> or any other of the Dis∣contented Parties.</ITEM>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XII.</HI> Of the Decrease of the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, and the Restoration of the <HI>Alexandrinian.</HI></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Fathers ill Success. The King prepares to restore the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Re∣ligion. Over-perswaded by the Queen and his Son. The Decrees resolv'd on in Council. The Patriarch makes a grave Speech to the contrary. Ʋpbraids him with his Victories and threatens him. At length he Suppli∣cates, but in vain. The Edict passes. Signify'd to the Patriarch, who proposes a Medium. The Edict publish'd to the great Satisfaction of the People. The Ancient Ceremonies us'd. An Invective Satyr against the Fathers. The sudden Change censur'd.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WEE have hitherto seen the great Progress of the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion in <HI>Ethiopia;</HI> the Authority of the Patriarch advanc'd to the utmost extent; the King and his Brothers, together with a great many of the Nobility, some sincerely, some feignedly favouring the Je∣suits. For the Latin Worship was with great diligence im∣pos'd and exercis'd all over several Provinces of the King∣dom. Many of the <HI>Habessine</HI> Priests were Ordain'd by the Patriarch; and great diligence was us'd for the building of Churches and Colleges. Already besides the Patriarch they had increas'd their Number to One and twenty Companions, that is to say, Nineteen Fathers, and Two Brothers of the Society, distributed into Thirteen Residencies. Nor could the Fathers but be well pleas'd with so many Thousands of Baptized and Converted People; for certainly the gaining of so many lost Souls by Baptism was not to be despised. When on a suddain behold a suddain Change, upon which the Banishment of the Fathers, and the Subversion of the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion ensu'd.</P>
<P>For the Fathers believing that the opportunity of the time was not to be neglected, made it their Business to abrogate all the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Rites, even those which were formerly tolerated under the <HI>Roman</HI> Bishops: on the other side, the Common People Wedded to their Old Customs; but more especially the Monks and Clergy, the chief Supporters of the old Religion, most stoutly oppos'd their Proceedings. Besides them, several of the Nobility, either out of Hatred
<PB N="353" REF="167"/>
of the <HI>Romans,</HI> or out of Ambition, frequently revolted, and through the strength of their unaccessible Rocks easily eluded the King's more mighty Power. A most remarkable Lesson to teach us, <HI>That that sort of Worship to which the People are averse, is not easily to be introduc'd by the Prince; and that it is no piece of Prudence or Policy to attempt the Liberty of those who are well defended by the Situation of their Country.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore the King, tho otherwise most addicted to the Fathers, wearied with so many Exclamations of his own Peo∣ple, growing in years, utterly disliking the present posture of Affairs, and fearful of what might ensue, tormented with the continual Importunities of his Friends; his Jealousie of his Brother, the Contumacy of the <HI>Lasteneers,</HI> the Diminu∣tion of his Prerogative, and the dread of losing his King∣dom, at length began to think of abrogating the <HI>Roman,</HI> and restoring the ancient <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Worship. And which was more to be admir'd, a prosperous Fight with the <HI>Lasteneers,</HI> was that which settled his wavering Thoughts. For making a fourth Expedition against them, he came upon them so unlook'd for, that he gave them a Total tout, Killing eight Thousand upon the place, with several of the Leaders of the Faction, and chief Deserters of their King and Country. The <HI>Portugueses</HI> rejoyc'd at the News, believing the Rebel∣lion quietted by this Victory; and that for the future nothing would presume so much as to hiss against the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion. But it fell out quite otherwise. For they who favour'd the the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Religion, the next day carry'd the King to view the Field of the Battel, and shewing him the multi∣tude of the Slain, thus bespake him. <HI>Neither</HI> Ethnics <HI>nor</HI> Mahumetans <HI>were these, in whose Slaughter we might have some reason to rejoyce. No, Sir, they were Christians, once your Sub∣jects, and our dear Countrymen; and partly to your self, partly to us related in Blood. How much more laudable would it have bin for these couragious Breasts to have bin oppos'd against the most deadly of your Enemies? This is no Victory, because obtain'd against your own Subjects. With the same Sword wherewith you Slaughter them, you Stab your own Bowels: Certainly they bare no hatred to us, whom we make War upon so cruelly. Only they are a verse to that Worship to which you would compel them. How many have we already kill'd upon this Change of Ceremonies? How many re∣main behind reserv'd for the same Slaughter? When will these Bloody Conflicts end? Forbear, we beseech your Majesty, to constrain them
<PB N="354" REF="168"/>
to Novelties, and Innovations, lest they renounce their Allegiance: otherwise we shall never behold the Face of Peace again. We are hated even by the</HI> Gallans <HI>and</HI> Ethnicks <HI>for abandoning our ancient Ceremonies, and are therefore by them call'd Apostates.</HI> For it seems that the King of <HI>Adel,</HI> having apprehended and put to Death two of the <HI>Fathers</HI> travelling into <HI>Habessinia</HI> thorow his Country, in the accompt which he gave to <HI>Susneus</HI> of what he had done, haughtily call'd him Apostate. Nor is it to be question'd but that the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> and Neighbour∣ing Nations were much Scandaliz'd at the Alteration of the <HI>Habessinian</HI> into the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion; not out of any love to the one, or hatred to the other; but for fear the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> strengthen'd by the <HI>Habessines</HI> should become their Masters. The <HI>Turks</HI> also were mad that the Metropolitan of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> was no more to be sent for out of <HI>Egypt;</HI> for by that same Tye they held the <HI>Habessines</HI> fast, and lyable to what Con∣ditions they pleas'd.</P>
<P>To these incessant Importunities, the Queen joyn'd the pow'rful Charms of her own Supplication, conjuring him by all the Obligations of Sacred Wedlock, and common Pledges of their undoubted Offspring, <HI>To be well advised what he did; and not to ruin his Kingdom, Himself, his Fortune, and his whole Family.</HI> With the same importunity his Eldest Son <HI>Basilides,</HI> and his Brother by the Mothers side <HI>Jamanax,</HI> hour∣ly sollicited his disturb'd mind: and the better to accom∣plish their ends, they underhand procur'd the <HI>Gallans</HI> that serv'd the King, to desire a dismission, as being unwilling to fight any longer against the <HI>Habessines</HI> in a quarrel about a new Religion. Thus the King's rigor mollify'd at length, <HI>Basilides,</HI> after he had summon'd the Nobility and chiefest of his Father's Counsellors together, held a Council, wherein it was concluded, That there was no other remedy to allay the Disorders of the Kingdom, but by restoring the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Religion. And the better to perswade those that were of the Contrary Opinion, they gave it out that the <HI>Romanists</HI> and <HI>Alexandrians</HI> were of the same Opinion in points of Faith; That both affirm'd that God was true Christ, and true Man. And as for the asserting One or Two Natures, they were only words of little Moment, and not worth the Ruin of a Mighty Empire. So that the King induc'd by these reasons, gave liberty to every one that pleas'd to return to the <HI>Alexan∣drian</HI> Forms.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="168"/>The Patriarch was not ignorant of these Transactions. Whereupon being accompanied with his Coadjutor, &amp; the chief of the Fathers, he desir'd Audience of the King. Which being granted, after a short Pause, <HI>Sir,</HI> said He, <HI>I had thought that we had lately bin the Victors, but now I see we are Vanquish'd: On the other side the</HI> Lasteneers, <HI>being overthrown and put to flight, have obtain'd their desires. Before the Battel was fought 'twas then a time to Vow and Promise, but now to fulfil. The Victory was gain'd by the Catholic and</HI> Portuguese <HI>Soldiers, the God of Hosts fa∣vouring the Catholic Religion. These are therefore but ill returns to his Divinity; For I understand, here has bin a Decree made, giving free toleration again of the</HI> Alexandrian <HI>Religion. But this is not a place I see to advise with Bishops and Religious Persons; the illite∣rate Vulgar, the</HI> Gallans <HI>and</HI> Mahumetans, <HI>Women here give their Judgments in Matters of Religion. Consider how many Victories you have gain'd from the Rebels, since you have embrac'd the</HI> Roman <HI>Religion: Remember, that you embrac'd it, not compell'd by force or fear, but of your own free choice, as believing it the Truer. Neither did we come hither as Intruders; we were sent hither, by the Pope and the King of</HI> Portugal <HI>at your request. Neither did they ever design any other thing in their thoughts, but only to unite your Empire to the Church of</HI> Rome. <HI>And therefore beware of exciting their just Indignation. They are 'tis true far distant hence; but God is at hand, and will require the Satisfaction which is due to them. You will throw an indelible blemish upon the Lion of the Tribe of</HI> Juda, <HI>which you bear for your Atchievement; You will blur your own re∣nown, and the Glory of your Nation: Lastly, you will be the un∣doubted occasion of innumerable Sins by y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur Apostacy; which that I may not see, nor feel the threatning revenge of the Almighty, Com∣mand this Head of mine to be immediately strick'n off.</HI> This said, with tears in their Eyes, the Patriarch and his Companions fell Prostrate at the King's feet, in expectation of his Answer. The King not any way concern'd, reply'd in few words, <HI>That he had done as much as he could, but could do no more, neither was a total alteration of Religion intended, but only a Concession of some Ceremonies.</HI> To which the Patriarch answer'd, <HI>That he had already tolerated some, and was ready to indulge more, which did not concern the Substance of Faith: So that he would put forth another Edict, that all things might remain as they were.</HI> To which he receiv'd no other reply, but <HI>That the King would send certain Commissioners to Treat and Discourse with the Fathers.</HI> Nor had they a better answer from the Prince, who being an Artist
<PB N="356" REF="169"/>
at Dissimulation, sent them away unsatisfy'd, with ambi∣guous words.</P>
<P>Upon the 24th of <HI>June,</HI> The favourers of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Religion, to the end they might get the Decree already men∣tion'd put in Execution, Address themselves to the Empe∣ror, and choosing <HI>Abba-Athanasius</HI> for their Prolocutor, be∣seech him, <HI>That he would by a Publick Edict be pleas'd to give his Subjects Liberty to return to the Religion of their Ancestors; that otherwise the Kingdom would be utterly ruin'd.</HI> The King assent∣ed, and order'd certain Commissioners to signifie his Pleasure to the Patriarch. They presently fell sharply to work with him, and upbraided him, <HI>with the frequent Rebellions of the People;</HI> Aelius, Cabrael, Tecla-George, <HI>and</HI> Sertzac, <HI>and with the Slaughter of so many Thousands as fell with them. That the</HI> Lasteneers <HI>were still in Arms for their ancient Religion; that all ran to them, and deserted the King, because all the</HI> Ha∣bessines <HI>pin'd after their ancient Religion. However, that for the future it should be free for every one to be at his own choice which to follow: for so from the Time of</HI> Claudius <HI>till lately, there had bin Peace and Quietness between different Opinions, while the</HI> Portugueses <HI>exercis'd theirs, the</HI> Habessines <HI>their own Re∣ligion.</HI></P>
<P>After a short time of Deliberation, an Answer was car∣ry'd back to the King by Father <HI>Emanuel D' Almeyda; That the Patriarch understood that the Exercise of both Religions would be free in his Kingdom. That for his part he had an equal love for</HI> Ethiopia, <HI>as for his own Native Country; and therefore for his part he was ready to grant whatsoever might be done, with safe∣ty to the Purity of sound Doctrine. But that there was still a difference to be made between those who had not yet embrac'd the</HI> Roman <HI>Religion, as the</HI> Lasteneers, <HI>for that they might be con∣niv'd at; but they who had positively embrac'd the</HI> Roman <HI>Faith, and had bin admitted to Confession and the Sacraments, no indulgence could be granted to them, without committing a great Sin, to return to the</HI> Alexandrian <HI>Schism.</HI></P>
<P>By this Temperament the Patriarch design'd to have put a Bar upon the King and all the Court, which had already publickly made Profession of the <HI>Romish</HI> Ceremonies. But the King, almost spent with Vexation and Grief, made no other answer than this: <HI>How can this be done? I am now no more Lord of my own Kingdom.</HI> So they were forc'd to de∣part as they came. Presently the Drums beat, the Trum∣pets
<PB N="357" REF="169"/>
sounded, and Proclamation was made by the Voice of the Cryer. <HI>O yez, O yez; In the first place we propounded to ye, the</HI> Roman <HI>Religion, esteeming it the best. But an innumerable multitude of Men, have perish'd through dislike of it with</HI> Aelius, Cabriel, Tecla-George, Sertzac, <HI>and lastly, with the Rustick</HI> Lastaneers. <HI>And therefore we grant you the free Exercise of the Religion of your Ancestors. It shall be lawful for you hencefor∣ward to frequent your own Churches, make use of your own Eucha∣ristic Arks, and to read the Liturgies after the old Custom. So fare∣well and Rejoyce.</HI></P>
<P>It is a thing almost impossible to be believ'd with what an Universal Joy this Edict was receiv'd among the People. The whole Camp, as if they had had some great Deliverance from the Enemy, rang with Shouts and Acclamations. The Monks and Clergy, who had felt the greatest weight of the Fathers Hatred lifted up their Thankful voices to Heaven. The promiscuous Multitude of Men and Women danc'd and caper'd; The Soldiers wish'd all happiness to their Comman∣ders: They brake to pieces their own and the Rosaries of all they met, and some they burnt. Crying out, that it was sufficient for them to believe, That Christ was true God and true Man, without the unnecessary Disputes concerning the two Natures. From thenceforward the old Ceremonies were made use of in the Communion; Grapestone Liquor instead of Wine. And the Holy Name of Jesus forbidden to be so frequent in their Mouths, after the <HI>Roman</HI> manner; and some that did not observe this Caution, they ran through with their Lances. Some few days after, a general Cir∣cumcision was appointed, not minding the pain of such a piece of Vanity, so they might not be thought to have neglected any thing of their ancient Rites in favour of the Fathers. Some there were also that us'd the ancient manner of washing themselves upon the Festival of the Epiphany, be∣lieving themselves thereby purify'd from the guilt of hav∣ing admitted the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion.</P>
<P>Others ran about Singing for joy that <HI>Ethiopia</HI> was deliver'd from the <HI>Western Lyons,</HI> Chanting forth the following Lines.</P>
<Q><L>At length the Sheep of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> free'd</L>
<L>From the Bold Lyons of the West,</L>
<L>Securely in their Pastures feed,</L>
<L><PB N="358" REF="170"/>St. <HI>Mark</HI> and <HI>Cyril</HI>'s Doctrine have o'recome</L>
<L>The Folly's of the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI></L>
<L>Rejoyce, rejoyce, Sing <HI>Hallelujahs</HI> all,</L>
<L>No more the Western Wolves</L>
<L>Our <HI>Ethiopia</HI> shall enthrall.</L></Q>
<P>And thus fell the whole Fabrick of the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, that had bin so long rearing with so much Labour and Ex∣pence, and which had cost the Effusion of so much Blood to pull it down. So vast and haughty Tow'rs that have bin long time Built, if once you undermine the Foundation, tumble in a moment. Some there were who accus'd the Fathers of the Society, as if they had ruin'd the fair Pro∣gress they had made by double Diligence, and over-hasty Zeal. For most of the <HI>Portugueses,</HI> and many of the <HI>Ha∣bessines</HI> themselves that were well affected to the <HI>Roman</HI> Reli∣gion took it ill, that things should be so suddainly chang'd, which might have bin longer let alone, without the least in∣jury done to fundamental Faith. For as tall Trees, that have taken deep root, are not easily Eradicated, so inveterated Opinions, which we have as it were suck't in with our Mo∣ther's Milk are not to be overcome but by length of time, great Lenity, and much Patience. For Humane under∣standing, if compell'd, puts on Obstinacy as it were in re∣venge of injur'd Liberty. Nor did some that were the Fa∣thers great Friends make any Question, that had they left some things indifferent, which the Pope himself many times freely tolerates, so it be acknowledg'd as the Act of his Be∣nignity and Dispensation, as the Computations of the holy Times, the Communion under both Kinds, and some other things which the Primitive Church without any Scandal to∣lerated and permitted, as the Marriage of Priests, the Fast of the fourth Holyday, the Observation of the Sabbath, and some other things which depended meerly upon Custom, and not upon Divine Precept, and had only minded in the mean time the Business of Conversion and Preaching, they had gain'd not only the <HI>Habessines,</HI> but the Pagans themselves, and working by degrees, had brought their design at length to perfection. But they relying wholly upon the Favour and Successes of the King were presently for compelling the <HI>Ha∣bessines</HI> to conform of a suddain in all things to a strange and uncouth Innovation. The Latin Tongue must be us'd in
<PB N="359" REF="170"/>
their Publick Sacred Worship, and their daily Prayers, the Angelical Salutation, the Lord's Prayer and the Apostolic Creed must be said in Latin, written in the Ethiopic Chara∣cters, in which <HI>Eve Maria grazia Plena,</HI> &amp;c. sounded strange∣ly and odly to the <HI>Habessinian</HI> Pronunciation. Which by de∣grees so alienated the Affections of the <HI>Habessinians</HI> from such a sort of aukward Devotion, so that at length all the Wars, Seditions, Pests of Locusts, Famine, and all the Ca∣lamities that follow'd, and the severe Penalties that were inflicted upon the <HI>Alexandrians</HI> were lay'd upon the <HI>Fathers;</HI> which begat them Hatred instead of Reverence, and Banish∣ment in the room of Favour and Affection.</P>
<P>From what has bin said, Men of Prudence will easily find the causes of so great a Mutation. Nevertheless it will not be improper to add those other which <HI>Tellez.</HI> has assign'd.</P>
<P>First he says, That the strict Tyes and Laws of Matri∣mony according to the Catholic Faith, were not so well brook'd by the <HI>Habessinians,</HI> being allow'd by the <HI>Alex∣andrian</HI> Religion, to Marry one or more, and to Divorce, as they saw good.</P>
<P>Secondly, That besides Incontinency, Avarice, Ambition, Envy, Hatred had got a head among them, especially a∣gainst <HI>Ras-Seelax,</HI> whose Power they could find no better way to pull down, than by Persecuting the <HI>Fathers;</HI> for whom he had so indear'd a Kindness.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That many were possess'd of the Church Lands, of which they were unwilling to make restitution.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That the Secular Judges complain'd that the Patriarch summon'd all Matrimonial Causes to his Tribunal.</P>
<P>Fifthly, That others were enrag'd to see Churches built with Lime and Stone; for they call'd them Castles, not Churches, built by <HI>Ras-Seelax,</HI> to the end he might make himself Master of <HI>Ethiopia.</HI></P>
<P>Sixthly, That the Monks were incens'd, to see the Fathers only in Esteem, and themselves formerly so high∣ly reverenc'd, afterwards contemn'd and slighted; so
<PB N="360" REF="171"/>
that as the other grew great, they should become nothing at all.</P>
<P>Seventhly, That the <HI>Habessines</HI> always appeal'd to the Manners and Rites of their Ancestors, not believing it to be just, to condemn them of Error, who had bin accompted Holy Men for so many Ages; or to hear and follow Inno∣vations, neglecting the Laws and Customs of their Fore-fathers. For through the vitiousness of Humane Malignity, saith <HI>Quintilian,</HI> Old things are always applauded, Novelties held to be loathsome. So that although you overcome the reason by Argument, you can never subdue the Will.</P>
<P>Eighthly, That the Devil had put it into the Heads of se∣veral Catholicks to make a corresponding Agreement be∣tween the Catholick and the <HI>Alexandrinian</HI> Religion; assert∣ing all to be Christians, as well <HI>Alexandrians</HI> as <HI>Romans.</HI> That all believe in Christ; That Christ saves all; That there is little Difference between both Religions; That both have Conveniencies and Inconveniencies, their Truths and their Errors, but that the Wheat was to be separated from the Cockle.</P>
<P>Ninthly, That the Ecclesiastical Censures seem'd very hea∣vy to the <HI>Habessines;</HI> especially when they heard the Patriarch name <HI>Dathan</HI> and <HI>Abiram</HI> in the Excommunication.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIII.</HI> Of the Expulsion of the Patriarch, and the Exile∣ment of the Fathers of the Society.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The <HI>Alexandrians</HI> quarrel with the Fathers; who are accurs'd. Their Churches taken from them. <HI>Susneus</HI> Dyes. <HI>Ras-Seelax</HI> renouncing the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Religion is Overthrown and Banish'd. Others put to Death. The Fathers Dispossessed of their Goods. Sent to <HI>Fremona.</HI> The Pa∣triarch by Letters Demands of the King the Causes of his Banishment, and a New Dispute. The King's Answer. The Fathers depart for <HI>Fre∣mona;</HI> Afterwards quite thrown out of the Kingdom.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFter the Publication of the King's Edict, the <HI>Alex∣andrians</HI> being now absolute Victors, endeavour'd with all their industry to be quit with the Fathers, and expel them quite out of <HI>Habessinia.</HI> To which purpose they omitted no occasion of daily quarrel and contention: First accusing the Patriarch for endeavouring by Seditious Sermons to stir up the People to Sedition, and to turn them from the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Religion; for that he had openly exhorted his Hearers to <HI>Constancy.</HI> But understanding that <HI>Basilides</HI> was displeas'd, and gave out threatning words, they thought it requisite to act more moderately. Soon after the <HI>Fathers</HI> Churches were taken from them, believing that would be a means to put a stop to the <HI>Roman</HI> Worship. And first they were constrain'd to quit their Cathedral at <HI>Gorgora,</HI> a stately Structure after the <HI>Eu∣ropean</HI> manner. At their departure they carry'd with them all their Sacred Furniture, brake all the Sculpture, and spoil'd the Pictures, that they might not leave them to be the sport of their Adversaries: doing that themselves, which they thought the <HI>Habessines</HI> would do. And this Example they follow'd in all other places from whence they were expell'd. In the mid'st of these Transactions, <HI>Susnèus</HI>'s Distemper increasing, and more and more aug∣mented by his continual anguish of Mind, he ended this Life the 16th day of <HI>Decemb.</HI> 1632.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="172"/>The King being Dead, the Fathers Adversaries set upon <HI>Ras-Seelax</HI> in the first place, as the Principal Favou∣rer and Protector of the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion: and first of all they promise him all his former Dignities, all his Possessions and Goods, upon Condition he would return to the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Religion. Upon his refusal, they bring him bound in Chains before the King, and pronounce him guilty of Death. But the King declaring that he would not pollute his hands with the Blood of his Un∣cle, commanded him to be carry'd to a certain remote Place, near to <HI>Samenar,</HI> and sequester'd his Goods. And as he was great, so was he attended in his fall by se∣veral others, as <HI>Atzai-Tino,</HI> Secretary of State, and the King's Historiographer, <HI>Walata Georgissa,</HI> the Queens Cou∣sin. In short, whoever had favour'd the Fathers, were all sent into Exile, and some put to Death, perhaps be∣cause they had bin more bitter in their Expressions than others against the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Religion. For some had call'd it, <HI>a Religion for Dogs.</HI> After all this the Enemies of the Fathers still insisted, <HI>That nothing was yet done, so long as the Patriarch and the Fathers were suffer'd to abide within the Confines of the Kingdom: Neither would the</HI> La∣staneers <HI>be quiet till they heard the Fathers were all thrown out of</HI> Ethiopia, <HI>but would look upon all things transacted for the re-establishment of the</HI> Alexandrian <HI>Religion as fictitious Stories.</HI></P>
<P>There needed not many words to press him that was already willing. First of all therefore, their Goods and Possessions were taken from them; then all their Arms, especially their Musquets and Fire-Arms. But before that, they were sent to <HI>Fremona,</HI> where, as we have already declar'd, <HI>Oviedo</HI> the Patriarch resided for some time. But before their Departure, the Patriarch wrote a certain Letter to the King, to this Effect:</P>
<P><HI>I did not adventure to come into</HI> Habessinia <HI>with my Com∣panions, of my own accord, but by the Command of the</HI> Roman <HI>Pontiff, and the King of</HI> Portugal, <HI>at the request of your Father, where having taken the King's Oath of Obedience, I officiated the Office of Patriarch in the Name of the</HI> Roman <HI>Pontiff, and the King of</HI> Portugal. <HI>Now because you Com∣mand
<PB N="363" REF="172"/>
me to depart, my humble request is, that your Majesty would set down the Causes of my Exilement in Writing, sub∣scrib'd with your own, and the hands of some of your Counsellors and Peers, that all the World may know whether I am compell'd to suffer for my Life and Conversation, or for the sake of my Doctrine. I granted the Ceremonies desired by your Father, ex∣cept the Communion under both Kinds, which only the Pope himself can dispute with. The same also I again offer, so that you and your Subjects will yield Obedience to the Church of</HI> Rome <HI>as the head of all other Churches. My last re∣quest is, That as the Matter was Debated at first, so it may be referr'd to another Dispute; by which means the Truth of the whole affair will more manifestly appear.</HI></P>
<P>To this Writing the King thus reply'd, <HI>Whatever was done by me before, was done by the Command of my Father, whom I was in Duty bound to Obey; so that I was forc'd to wage War under his Conduct, both with Kindred and Subjects. But after the last Battel of</HI> Wainadega <HI>the Learned and Un∣learned Clergy and Layety, Civil and Military, young and old, all sorts of Persons made their Addresses to my Father, Crying out,</HI> How long shall we be perplexed and wearied with un∣profitable things? How long shall we encounter Bre∣thren and Kindred, cutting off the right hand with the left? How long shall we thrust our Swords into our own Bowels? Especially since we learn nothing from the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion but what we knew before. For what the <HI>Romans</HI> call the two Natures in Christ, his Divinity and his Humanity, that we knew from the beginning to this time. For we all believe that our Lord Christ is perfect God and perfect Man; perfect God in his Divinity, and perfect Man in his Humanity. But in regard those Natures are not separated nor di∣vided; for neither of them subsist of its self, but both of them conjoyn'd the one with the other; therefore we do not say that they are two things. For one is made two, yet so as the Natures are not mix'd in their Sub∣sistence. <HI>This Controversie therefore among us is of little mo∣ment; neither was it for this that there has bin so much Bloodshed among us, but chiefly because the Blood was deny'd to the Layety, whereas Christ has said in his Gospel,</HI> Unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood,
<PB N="364" REF="173"/>
ye shall not have life everlasting; <HI>and when he instituted the Holy Supper, he did not say, The Blood is in my Body, which I have given to you alone; but take and drink, and partake all. From that time the Disciples did as they were commanded. The In∣termission of the Fast of the fourth Holyday, which is neverthe∣less enjoyn'd by the Canons of the Holy Apostles: as also a va∣rious manner of Fasting in the Time of</HI> Lent. <HI>Besides by al∣tering the Order of the whole Ecclesiastical Computation in reference to the Annual Festivals, and the Permission of all Per∣sons to enter into the Church, without any distinction of clean or unclean; these are the things that gave offence to our People. But they detested nothing more, than the reiteration of Baptism, as if we had bin Heathens, before we had bin Baptiz'd by the Fathers. They re-ordain'd our Priests and Deacons, they burnt the wooden Chests of our Altars, and Consecrated some Altars of their own, as if ours had not bin Consecrated before. The Monks also complain'd, that their Institutions were abrogated. These and others of the same Nature were the true Causes, that we abandon'd the</HI> Roman <HI>Faith, tho it was not we who gave it Protection but our Father. And therefore, because the</HI> Alexandrian Abuna <HI>is now upon his Journey hither, and hath sent us word, that he cannot live or joyntly act in the same Kingdom with the</HI> Roman <HI>Patriarch, and the Fathers, we command you to hasten to</HI> Fremona. <HI>Those things are offer'd now too late, which might have bin easily at first allow'd: For now there is no return∣ing to that, which all the whole Nation abhors and detests: for which reason, all farther Colloquies and Disputes will be in vain.</HI></P>
<P>The Patriarch relates in his Epistle to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> That that same Metropolitan, of whom the King makes mention, came some years before into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> but lay pri∣vately conceal'd in <HI>Enarea,</HI> where hearing of the disown∣ing and casting off the Patriarch, he brake out into this far∣ther Expression, to the King, <HI>That he could not officiate in his Office, unless the Patriarch and the Fathers were either put to Death, or Banish'd to perpetuity.</HI> So that the Patriarch and the Fathers were forc'd to obey the King's Command, not without a long Dispute about their Guns, which they would willing∣ly have kept for their own Preservation; but they were forc'd to deliver them up, that they might be of no use to the <HI>Portugals,</HI> who were coming, as it was fear'd and report∣ed, to their assistance. Thus the Patriarch with all the Fa∣thers that were then in the Country, were constrain'd to leave
<PB N="365" REF="173"/>
their warm Seats after an Enjoyment of Eight years standing. In their return they met with various Misfortunes, and were frequently infested with Thieves, before they could get to <HI>Fremona.</HI> But because they foresaw, that would be no abi∣ding place for'em of any long continuance, they presently resolv'd to send away some of the Fathers before into <HI>India,</HI> to give the Vice-Roy an accompt of the state of their affairs, and to desire some remedy, that is to say, a good sufficient strength of <HI>Portuguesis.</HI> But before they could obtain that, they receiv'd fresh Commands from the King (who 'tis very probable smelt their Design) to remove from <HI>Fremona</HI> and be gon. But they sang loath to depart a great while, and to spin out time, privately retir'd to one <HI>John Akay,</HI> formerly an Enemy to the King, who not being able to defend them, they were pull'd out thence by the Ears, and in <HI>May</HI> 1634. deliver'd to the <HI>Turks,</HI> and first carry'd to <HI>Arkiko</HI> and <HI>Matzua,</HI> after that to <HI>Suaqena,</HI> and brought beore the <HI>Turkish Basha.</HI> And indeed there was nothing more that provok'd the <HI>Ha∣bessines,</HI> as <HI>Gregory</HI> told me, then that they should require aid of the Military Power from <HI>India</HI> to establish their Religion: <HI>They might,</HI> said he, <HI>have shaken the dust from their shoes at their departure, as the Apostles were commanded; but they were for settling Religion with Swords and Guns.</HI> Which was not done so secretly but it came to the Ears of the <HI>Habessines;</HI> for it seems that some of their Train, vext at some Misfortune or other, had imprudently threaten'd it. Which was one reason among others that their Churches built of Stone and Morter, and their Guns were taken from them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIV.</HI> Of what happen'd after the Departure of the Patriarch and the Fathers out of <HI>Ethiopia.</HI></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Condition of the Bishop and his Associates privately left behind. The Patriarchs misery among the <HI>Turks. Peter Heyling</HI> a German Disputes with him. <HI>Peter</HI> entertain'd by the King of <HI>Habessinia.</HI> Various reports concerning his Death. The Patriarch redeems himself. He sends <HI>Hie∣rom Lobo</HI> for Assistance, who cannot speed. The favourers of the Fa∣thers put to Death in <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> Now admitted into <HI>Habessinia.</HI> Six Capuchins sent again; their ill success. Three more sent after them; their sad Misfortune. <HI>Nogueira</HI> Hang'd. <HI>Mendez</HI> dyes in <HI>India.</HI> After that no News from <HI>Habessinia.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NOtwithstanding the King's Commands to all in ge∣neral, the Patriarch left behind privately in several places <HI>Apollinaris Almeyda, Hiacynthos Francisco, Ludo∣vigo Cordeyra, Bruno Bruni</HI> and some others, who after they had liv'd miserably for some time, lurking up and down, at last were most of them Hang'd. In the mean time he himself spent almost a whole year in great Vexation, and full of sorrow among the Barbarous <HI>Turks</HI> in <HI>Suaqena,</HI> al∣most melted by the Sun. But nothing more increas'd the anguish of his Mind, than the News of the New Metropo∣litan's arrival out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and that it should be his mis∣fortune to be constrain'd to behold him as he pass'd by. He had in his Train a certain <HI>German,</HI> whose Name was <HI>Peter Heyling,</HI> a Native of <HI>Lubeck,</HI> a young Gentleman emi∣nent for Probity and Learning, a Professor of the <HI>Augustan,</HI> or <HI>Lutheran</HI> Religion, and generally call'd by the Title of <HI>Muallim,</HI> that is in Arabic, <HI>Doctor Peter.</HI> He being desirous to see the world, and learn the Arabic Language, was arriv'd about that time in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and was very much esteem'd for his Piety and Modesty by the <HI>Coptites,</HI> and hearing that the Metropolitan was going for <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> he obtain'd leave to go in his Train, and by that means met the Patriarch <HI>Alphonsus</HI> at <HI>Suaqene.</HI> Presently he undertook to encounter him, opposing several Opinions and Tenents of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, and expounding in Arabic to the standers by, whatever was said on both sides. The Patriarch in a heat
<PB N="367" REF="174"/>
desir'd him to forbear that Explanation, because he did not understand the Arabic. To which the other answer'd, That he Disputed, for others to hear as well as himself. The Disputation being ended, The Patriarch, turning to his Companions, sighing, told them, <HI>That if that Doctor went into</HI> Habessinia, <HI>he would precipitate the whole Country into Heresie.</HI> He was no sooner arriv'd there, but he became very accepta∣ble to the King, who gave him a Tent, and all things ne∣cessary. Concerning his Death, various Reports were spread abroad. For some said, That being most graciously and kindly entertain'd by the King, he dy'd in <HI>Habessinia:</HI> Others, that being honourably dismiss'd by the King, he was murder'd by certain Arabian Thieves.</P>
<P>As for the Patriarch, after a long Captivity and very bad Usage from the <HI>Turks,</HI> he was at length set at Liberty, after he had pay'd for himself and his Companions a Ran∣som of 4000 <HI>German</HI> Dolars, and so at length got safe to <HI>Goa.</HI> Where, tho he were advis'd to go himself into <HI>Portu∣gual,</HI> and give an accompt of the afflicted State of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> he thought it the better way to send <HI>Jeronymo Lobo,</HI> with or∣der to desire the Aid of a sufficient Military Power, to restore him to his lost See. Thereupon the diligent Jesuit, not only went into <HI>Portugal,</HI> but also to <HI>Mantua</HI> to <HI>Philip</HI> the Fourth, and from thence to <HI>Rome.</HI> But all his Negotiations prov'd ineffectual; whether it were that they did not think it at that instant so Apostolical a way to propagate the Gospel by force of Arms; or whether it were that they did not like the Charge of an Expedition, from whence they could hope for little good, there being no considerable Party in the Kingdom to give them footing, and the encouragement of Assistance. For the King watchful over all casualties, put all to Death that favour'd the <HI>Roman Fathers.</HI> Which occasion'd the Ruin of many of the No∣bility; among the rest <HI>Tecla-Selax;</HI> and several Priests that had taken <HI>Roman</HI> Orders; and all the Fathers, except <HI>Ber∣nard Nogueyra,</HI> whom the Patriarch had created his Vicar. For tho the Patriarch attempted afterwards to send seve∣ral other Fathers, yet all their Endeavours were in vain; so that for a long time he could learn no News concerning the State of Ecclesiastical Affairs in <HI>Habessinia.</HI> For the King fearing lest the <HI>Portugueses</HI> should invade his Dominions in revenge of the Fathers, had brib'd the <HI>Turkish</HI> Basha's of
<PB N="368" REF="175"/>
<HI>Suaqena</HI> and <HI>Matzua,</HI> willing enough to that of themselves, not to admit entrance to any of the <HI>Franks.</HI></P>
<P>The News of which coming to <HI>Rome,</HI> the Minds of men were variously affected. The greatest part were sorry that all their fair hopes of retaining <HI>Ethiopia</HI> in Pontifical Obedi∣ence were quite cut off. Others blam'd the Fathers of the Society, that through their Arrogance and Imprudence in managing the Temper and Disposition of the <HI>Habessines;</HI> they had ruin'd both themselves and the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion; whereas they ought to have made it their Business to have acted chiefly and in the first place for the Majesty, and Au∣thority of the Pope over the Universal Church, and willingly to have suffer'd all Miseries, and Martyrdoms, rather than have quitted their Station. <HI>Tellez</HI> involves these particulars in a general Relation, saying, That several Malevolent Re∣ports were spread about in <HI>Rome;</HI> and some there were who gave out, That the <HI>Fathers,</HI> out of meer detestation of their Persons, and hatred of the whole Nation of <HI>Portugal</HI> were ejected out of <HI>Habessinia:</HI> and that if other Preachers were sent, the <HI>Habessines</HI> would willingly embrace both them and their Doctrine. Which was a thing to be done with much less Expence, and more probable to come to effect than <HI>Lobo</HI>'s Project of sending an Army.</P>
<P>Therefore the <HI>Congregation for propagating the Faith,</HI> took another Course, and sent Six <HI>Capuchin</HI> Fryers, all <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> with Letters of Recommendation and safe Conduct from the Emperor of the <HI>Turks</HI> himself, with Orders to try what they could do in <HI>Habessinia.</HI> Two of these going by Sea, landed at <HI>Magadoso,</HI> seated upon the Eastern Coast of <HI>Africa;</HI> but before they could get many Leagues up into the Countrey, they were knock't o'the head by the Cafers. Two of them got as far as the Confines of <HI>Habessinia;</HI> but being discover'd, they were presently Commanded either to return back, or make Profession of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Religion; and upon their refusal to do either, were presently ston'd to Death. Of which, when the other two that stay'd at <HI>Matzua</HI> had notice, they rather chose to return home again than suffer Martyr∣dom to no purpose.</P>
<P>Nevertheless Three other <HI>Capuchins,</HI> in hopes of better Fortune, resolv'd to make one tryal more; who when they arriv'd at <HI>Suaqena,</HI> I know not by what advice, wrote Let∣ters to the <HI>Abyssine</HI> King, as it were to Congratulate him upon

their arrival. But the King to retaliate their Kindness, wrote back not to them, but to the Basha of <HI>Suaqena,</HI> to send him only their Heads; which the Basha in hopes of a Reward, very readily did, with a more than ordinary Ceremony. For after he had caus'd their Heads to be strucken off, he or∣der'd the Skins to be flea'd off, and so sent them to the King, that by their Colour he might know them to be <HI>Franks,</HI> and by their Shaving to be <HI>Priests.</HI></P>
<P>At length also <HI>Bernard Nogueira</HI> was apprehended, the last of all the Fathers, and fairly Hang'd. As for the Patriarch <HI>Mendez,</HI> he liv'd in <HI>India</HI> till the year 1656. Where in the 22d of his Exile, and the 77th of his Age he dy'd upon the 29 day of <HI>January.</HI> He was endu'd with most accomplish'd gifts both of Body and Mind, very Tall, and of a firm Constitu∣tion of Body, well read both in the Greek and Latin, and every way fitted for his Employment. Neither had he want∣ed Prudence, had not the King's Favour and Success which oftentimes intoxicate the Wisest of Men, trans∣ported him out of the way to act with that violence and severity where gentleness and caution were so requisite. By which means, instead of gaining, he was forc'd to suffer the shameful detriment of that Authority, which he had too far extended. Others, as <HI>Gregory</HI> told me, excus'd him, for that upon his arrival he found things so far driven on by the Mis∣sionaries, that he could not with Honour recede from what they had done. Since the Death of the Patriarch we have had no certain Relations out of <HI>Habessinia.</HI> In the year 1652. a new Metropolitan was sent into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> who had bin seen by many <HI>Europeans</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and was succeeded afterwards by several others, as we have gather'd from certain Relation. From whence we may infer, That the report of <HI>Tellez</HI> was a thing fram'd out of Envy; as if the King of the <HI>Habessines</HI> had sent his Ambassadors into <HI>Arabia,</HI> to desire thence Maho∣metan Doctors, with an intention to embrace Turcism, which no man can think probable, from what has bin alrea∣dy related. For how is it likely that he who could not Pro∣tect the splendid Religion of the <HI>Romish</HI> Church, and the spe∣cious Doctrines of the Fathers, because they were thought by the <HI>Habessines</HI> to be repugnant to Scripture, and the De∣crees of the Primitive Church, should be able to admit of the Vanity and Absurdity of Mahumetism: the Original and Progress of which is so well known to the <HI>Habessines</HI> already.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="178"/>A Religion that did not prevail by <HI>suffering</HI> and <HI>well-doing</HI> like the Christian Religion, but by force of Arms was obtruded upon Barbarous and Discording Nations. The Clergy and Monks so wedded to their <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Religion would no more endure it than they did the superstition of <HI>Susneus.</HI> So that should the King and his Peers be so vain as to attempt a thing so detestable to his People, he could not expect but to be more vigorously and generally oppos'd than ever his Father was. But lastly, the King's Letters of the last Date to the Governor of <HI>Batavia</HI> beginning with a Christian Preface sufficiently demonstrate, that he was a Christian, when <HI>Tel∣lez</HI> rais'd that report.

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Letters used by the <HI>Ethiopians.</HI></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>They obtain'd the use of Letters with their Divine Worship. The Ori∣ginal of the Greek and Latine Letters. The <HI>Ethiopic</HI> more agreeable with the <HI>Samaritan</HI> then <HI>Hebrew</HI> Characters. The Inventor of theirs, ignorant both of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Greek:</HI> The Letters ancient, but not all invented at the same time. The <HI>Amharic</HI> Characters. The story of the <HI>Chaldaic</HI> and Holy Character refuted.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat Learning and Divine Worship generally go together, we have hinted already. For we see it has so happen'd among most Na∣tions of <HI>Europe;</HI> which when they gave the name to the Latine Church, entertain'd also its Letters, and most of its words. Sometimes also New Letters have abolish'd the use of Old ones, as we find by the Example of the<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">They are call'd <HI>Runer</HI> in the North, and are to be seen engrav'd upon Stones in several places. See <HI>Wormias</HI>'s <HI>Runic Literature</HI> and the <HI>Runic Lexicon</HI> Printed at <HI>Copenhagen.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Runic</HI> Letters of the Ancient
<PB N="376" REF="179"/>
<HI>Goths,</HI> in the time of Christianity. Thus the <HI>Russians</HI> receiv'd their Letters, together with their Divine Worship from the <HI>Greek</HI> Church. Over all the <HI>East,</HI> and the greatest part of <HI>Africa,</HI> the <HI>Arabic</HI> Literature and Language crept in, toge∣ther with <HI>Islamism,</HI> the Ancient <HI>Persian</HI> being thrown out, and all other Nations, if there were any that us'd the <HI>Arabic</HI> Letters before. And as for our own Native Characters, as we express them in Writing, though they seem to differ very much from the <HI>Latine</HI> and <HI>Greek,</HI> especially while the Letters are so vary'd and transform'd with the strokes and dashes of various hands as fancy and swiftness of Writing guides the Pen, yet if we more accurately consider the old Characters, and those the same as they appear in Printing, we shall find it no great difficulty to derive them from the Ancient <HI>Latine.</HI></P>
<P>It is the Ancient Opinion of the Learned, That <HI>Cadmus</HI> re∣commended the <HI>Phenician</HI> Letters to the <HI>Greeks;</HI> and the <HI>Greeks</HI> to the <HI>Latines;</HI> and they to all the rest of <HI>Europe;</HI> first by means of their Conquests, then of their Religion, though there be every where a great difference in the shape of the Letters: among those Nations also that use the <HI>Arabic</HI> Let∣ters, there is a vast variety of Writing. Not to speak of the <HI>Persians</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> but of the <HI>Moors,</HI> and <HI>Western People</HI> of <HI>Africa,</HI> whose Letters, though Originally <HI>Arabic,</HI> you shall hardly understand.</P>
<P>But as to what concerns our <HI>Ethiopic Letters,</HI> some of them indeed may correspond in Name, but in shape there is not the least appearance of similitude: so that if an Argument were to be drawn from the Letters, we might say, that the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> receiv'd neither their Divine nor Civil Worship from the <HI>Israelites.</HI> Nevertheless they seem to have some cor∣respondence with the <HI>Samaritan</HI> Characters, which many most Judicious Men acknowledge for the Original and Genu∣ine Letters of the Ancient <HI>Hebrews:</HI> and yet neit her will these without a great deal of Labour, be brought to any Assimu∣lation. We shall give you a view of the two <HI>Alphabets</HI> both together.</P>

<P>In this Scheme, we have not follow'd any <HI>Samaritan</HI> Al∣phabet, but selected them out of the several Figures, which the most Famous <HI>Walton</HI> has produc'd in his preparation for the <HI>Polyglotton,</HI> which seem'd more like our <HI>Ethiopians.</HI> For my part I am not apt to believe, that the Inventor of the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Letters who is yet to me unknown, had any knowledge either of the Ancient <HI>Greek,</HI> or these <HI>Samaritan</HI> Letters; or that he receiv'd them from any other for the certain use of Religion, but that they were found and ordered by particular fancy, for the use of the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Pronunciation, which is manifest from the different disposition of the Letters, the different Order of the Points, and manner of Reading, contrary to the Custom of all the <HI>Eastern</HI> People, who begin from the Left to the Right; and lastly from the <HI>Greek</HI> Numerical Characters. But that they are very old, is apparent from hence, for that several Characters carry the same Pronunciation, and are therefore by the <HI>Abessines</HI> promiscuously us'd in their Writing. Former∣ly I am of Opinion, they had a different sound; for it seems not probable that the first Inventor would accommodate two or three Letters various in shape, to one pronunciation. Then again they were not invented together, nor at the same time; for the <HI>Greek</HI> II or the <HI>P</HI> of the <HI>Latines</HI> was wanting of old among the <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> and the other <HI>Oriental Languages</HI> that were of the same Pedegree;<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Many Learned men make use of <HI>Dagesh</HI> soft, instead of the invented <HI>Ma∣soretick</HI> one; otherwise the Seventy Interpreters, who themselves were <HI>Jews,</HI> had ex∣pressed the Initial Letter <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which we now pronounce <HI>Pe,</HI> by a α and not φ in the words <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> which the <HI>Jews</HI> at this day utter <HI>Peleg, Paraoh.</HI></NOTE> instead of which, they us'd either their Forrain <HI>Pait,</HI> in pronouncing <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul;</HI> or else the Letter <HI>Bet</HI> B. after the manner of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> who

<P>BEsides <HI>Sacred Books,</HI> the <HI>Habessines</HI> have but very few others.

<P>They meddle with no Studies, but those of their own Learned Language, and Sacred Matters. Most believe, they

have enough, if they can but Read and Write: and that either the Parents teach their Children to do, or else certain of their <HI>Monks</HI> for a small stipend. They have no written Laws, Justice and Right is determined by Custom, and the Ex∣amples of their Ancestors: and most differences are ended by the Will of the Judge.</P>
<P>Their manner of Administring <HI>Physick</HI> is most Deplorable, They Cure Men by cutting and burning, as they do Horses. They cure the <HI>Yellow Jaundies,</HI> by applying a hot burning Iron in manner of a Semicircle, toward the upper end of the Arm, laying a little Cotton upon the Wound, that the Humour may issue forth, so long as the Disease remains. In most Distempers, every Person is his own Physitian, and uses such Herbs as he learnt were useful from his Parents. Some are of Opinion, that it is not a Pin matter, whether they make use of <HI>Physitians</HI> or Apothecaries or no, not believing it worth their while to be recover'd at so great Expences. If the King be sick, they come to him, ask him, as if it were out of pity, <HI>What he ayles, and what is his Distemper?</HI> And if any one have been ill of the same Distemper, he tells, what did him good, deeming the same Remedies applicable to all Con∣stitutions. If a Pestilence chance to break out, they leave their Houses and Villages, and retire with their Heards in∣to the Mountains, putting all their Security in flying from the Contagion. <HI>Tertian Agues</HI> they Cure, by applying the <HI>Cramp-fish</HI> to the Patient, which is an unspeakable Torture. <HI>Wounds</HI> they Cure by the help of <HI>Myrrhe,</HI> which is very plen∣tiful among them.</P>
<P>I have not as yet ever seen the Treatise of <HI>Philosophy,</HI> which I mention'd at the beginning of the Chapter; but it appears by the Theological Disputations of their Divines, that they are none of the Acutest Logicians; nor have they any know∣ledge of Natural Philosophy, as is apparent to any one that reads their Books, concerning the mixture of the Four Ele∣ments in the Creation of Man; as also, concerning the Soul, the Author of the <HI>Organum</HI> gives this accompt.</P>
<P><HI>God made a Miracle when he Created our Father</HI> Adam, <HI>and Formed him of the Four Elements: he mixed the Elements, yet so that they should not disagree among themselves; the First with the Second, and the Third with the Fourth: he mix'd the dry with the Moist, and the Hot with the Cold; the Visible with the Invisible, the Palpable with the Impalpable: He made Two out of the Pal∣pable
<PB N="381" REF="181"/>
and Two out of the Impalpable: He made Three of the Dry, and One of the Moist: He made Three out of the Visible, and One out of the Invisible. The great Architect knew where the In∣ner Chamber was to be Seated, and plac'd the Corners of the House in the Four</HI> Elements; <HI>and understanding that a vessel of Clay could not move nor speak, without the mixture of a Spirit that must come from Himself, therefore he Breath'd upon his Face and made him Rational and Self-moving; as saith the most Holy Law.</HI> He Breath'd into the Face of <HI>Adam,</HI> the breathing place of Life; and he became Man by the Breath of Life. <HI>Therefore the Soul dies not with the Body; for that proceeding out of the Mouth of the Lord, it was mixt with the Body: as saith our Lord in the Gospel,</HI> Fear not those who kill the Body, but cannot kill the Soul. <HI>Now as to what he said,</HI> Thou shalt not kill the Soul; <HI>be spoke concerning the sensitive Soul: because there are two Souls in Man; one the</HI> Spirit of Life, <HI>which proceeded out of the Mouth of God, not reckon'd among the</HI> Elements, <HI>and which never dyes. The other is, the</HI> Blood of the Body; <HI>that is to say,</HI> the Sensitive Soul, <HI>which has its Original from the</HI> Elements, <HI>and that is Morral. Wherefore God said,</HI> Thou shalt not eat the Flesh with the Blood; <HI>because the Blood is the Sensitive Soul. But the Pillar of the House of God, is the</HI> Spirit of Life. <HI>Now after the</HI> Spirit of Life <HI>is departed, the Body becomes a Carcass; therefore the Law pronounc'd the Carcass Unclean, because the</HI> Spirit of Life <HI>is de∣parted from it. But among us, we reckon the Dead Body of a</HI> Chri∣stian <HI>to be clean, because the Human Body was mix'd with the Blood of Divinity: besides that the Grace of</HI> Baptism <HI>departs not from it: and concerning the Carcass of the</HI> Son of the Virgin, David <HI>said,</HI> They cast away their Brother as an unclean Car∣cass. <HI>That is, they did not understand it to be holy; because the</HI> Jews <HI>were his Brethren in respect of his Mother: and by their Law the Carcass was reputed unclean.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be wondred, that the <HI>Habessines,</HI> who cannot un∣derstand two Natures in Christ united in one Existence, should find out two Souls in the body of Man. And yet it is no wonder when we consider, that there are some, who imagine Three Souls in Man; whereas they might feign a great ma∣ny more, should they but take every Animal Faculty for a Soul.</P>
<P>But these, and such like Conceptions admit of Excuse and Interpretation, though what the vulgar believe concerning the <HI>Fabrick of the World,</HI> are altogether absurd, and not worth

relating, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Earth is a round Globe and pendent in the middle of the Air; this they look upon as a meer Fa∣ble. What think ye, they would say, should any one teach them, that the Planets are Animals, and instead of the Sun, that stands still, always walking the rounds of the Heavens? Or assert the <HI>Antipodes</HI> to them, with their Feet upwards, and their Heads downwards, and yet keeping a steady Motion? certainly they would think, that such people would necessari∣ly drop into Heaven; though as to this we are not to deride their Ignorance, in regard several Holy and Grave Men have deny'd the <HI>Antipodes:</HI> nevertheless, they most idly dream that when the Sun rises and sets, he goes and comes again through a certain kind of Window; but which way he gets under the Earth, they are not very sollicitous about: and yet in this, they seem much wiser than <HI>Mahomet</HI> the great Prophet of the <HI>Mussel-men,</HI> who fancy'd, That the Sun went to sleep in a Well; <HI>Gregory</HI> was taken for a very great <HI>Philosopher</HI> in his Country, for that he had made a certain Convex Model of Pastboard, like the Arch of Heaven, to the inside of which, he fastned several graines of Wheat, to represent the Stars of the First Magnitude, and then turn'd the Concavity upper∣most, to shew how the Heavens mov'd about the Earth, en∣compas'd about by the Air.</P>
<P>As to the Liberal Arts they love <HI>Poesie</HI> above all the rest, but only that which is Divine: for Prophane Verses they hate, which made <HI>Gregory</HI> extreamly wonder, that after the Wor∣ship of the <HI>Heathen Gods</HI> was quite taken away, and the Temples of their Gods were wholly destroyed, that the Books and Verses which Treated or were Dedicated to them, were not as utterly Abolish'd. For that it was not fitting for Christians to read the Rude and Obscene Fables of their feigned Divinities, much less to imitate them, and fetch from thence the chief Ornaments of their Poems; seeing that the very Footsteps of Idolatry ought to be an abomination to Christianity. These Verses of the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> consist in meer Rithmes; if we may Assert Consonants of the same Order differing in the Vowels, to be Rithmes. For beside those, there is no other Matter to be observ'd: Of these they have several sorts, as we shall teach in another Place. They are also very much delighted with abstruse Sayings and Proverbs; as for Example, <HI>The Mountains of</HI> Kobol <HI>as with a burning-Glass and so the prefix'd time of Man, is consum'd by the passing of his days.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="182"/>They are extreamly Covetous of Learning, and were extreamly importunate with the <HI>Jesuits</HI> to teach their Chil∣dren the Latine Language. But they were more eager in pro∣moting the <HI>Latine Religion,</HI> then the <HI>Language;</HI> pretending the difficulty of the Undertaking, and the vast difference be∣tween the <HI>Latine</HI> and <HI>Amharic</HI> Pronounciation. Indeed, it cannot be deny'd, but that it is a most difficult thing to teach a Person who never heard of <HI>Grammar,</HI> as I found by the tryal of <HI>Gregory.</HI> For the <HI>Habessines</HI> learn Languages only by Con∣verse, more especially the <HI>Arabic,</HI> which is frequently spoken by the neighbouring Merchants, the <HI>Mahometans</HI> who are sub∣ject to the King, and the Courtiers themselves; and in this Language the King Writes his Letters to Forrain Princes. On the otherside the <HI>Arabians</HI> themselves, as they are very much inclin'd to propagate their Fables among the Christians, write them in the <HI>Arabick</HI> Language, but make use of the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Letters, that thereby they may the more easily impose upon the simple people. Private persons seldom write Letters, nor do they know the method of sending them. But if any one has a desire to write, he goes to the Scribe of the <HI>Province,</HI> who is call'd, <HI>Pahafe Hagare,</HI> and for a small Sum of Money causes him to Compose them an <HI>Epistle:</HI> and you must know that the Exordiums of their Epistles are various in their Forms, for that in the Elegancy of their first Ad∣dresses, they place the chiefest ornament of their Comple∣ments.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the Domestick Oeconomie of the <HI>Habessines:</HI> Their Marriages, Dyet, Cloathing, Habitati∣ons and Burials.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Their Marriages Christian. <HI>Polygamy</HI> lawful by the Civil Laws, not by the Ecclesiastical. Divorces. Nuptial Ceremonies. Benediction Sacerdotal. Their Dyet raw Beef, or half boyl'd; and Herbs half con∣cocted by the Cattle. What Bread. Their way of making Butter. Their washing their Cloathes. Their Drink. Hydromel Ale. Their Cloathing thin. Very Parsimonious, accustom'd to go Naked. They Curl and anoint their Hair with Butter. Mean Habitations. The Kings Palaces. Their manner of bewailing the Dead. The Funeral Pomp of their Kings.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe <HI>Habessines</HI> Marry with every one of their Wives after the Christian manner: neither are they hin∣dred by any Law of the Land from Marrying several, though they are Prohibited by their <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Penalties, as being contrary to the Sacred Canons and In∣stitutions of the Christians: and therefore they that Exer∣cise <HI>Polygamie</HI> are not admitted to the Communion, as we have already said: For they are of that Opinion, That whatever is not prejudicial to the Publick, or to the securi∣ty and Tranquillity of private Persons is not to be Prosecuted with secular Punishment; Neither are they scrupulous in suing out Divorces; assuming the same liberty to put away as to marry their Wives.</P>
<P>As for the particulars of their Nuptial Ceremonies, they are not of that importance as to Merit a Relation; nor are they the same in all Countries. Those which <HI>Alvares</HI> re∣counts, of the Nuptial Bed being brought forth and plac'd before the Doors of the House by Three of the <HI>Presbyters,</HI> and then walking round it singing <HI>Hallelujas;</HI> or the cutting off the Locks of the Couple to be Wedded, for each to make an exchange, they were altogether unknown to <HI>Gre∣gory;</HI> and that if it were the Custom any where so to do, it was only as he said, in some parts of <HI>Tygra:</HI> but that the <HI>Sacerdotal Benediction</HI> was necessary to all Weddings he ab∣solutely granted.</P>
<P>Their Diet is not only very homely, but also far diffe∣rent
<PB N="387" REF="184"/>
from ours; for they feed either upon raw Flesh, or half boyl'd. <HI>Alvares</HI> gives you an Example of the Governour of <HI>Hangot, (Angot-Ras)</HI> who entertain'd <HI>Rodoric Limez</HI> at his Table with no other sort of Junkets then such mean Fare, very loathsom to the <HI>Portuguess</HI> Embassadour; for instead of Sauce they bring the Gall, which pleases their vitiated Pa∣lates far better then Honey: but what is worse than all this, they covet as a daintie, the half Concocted Grass and green Herbs which they find in the Maws of the Beasts which they kill, and greedily devour those morsels, having first season'd them with Pepper and Salt, as if the Beasts better understood what Herbs were most wholsom then themselves: a sort of Dyet which none of our <HI>Europeans</HI> will envy them. Their Bread they bake upon the Embers, made in the fashion of thin Pancakes, which they call <HI>Apas.</HI></P>
<P>We have already declared, That in some of the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Territories, the People live all upon Grazing; their Flocks and Herds are their only Riches, they eat their Flesh, and drink their Milk. Thus that <HI>King and no King Jacob,</HI> lurking in the recesses of the Rocks and Mountains, always carry'd his liv∣ing Kitchen and Cellar with him, which were only three or four Goats at a time. Where the Air is temperate, they make excellent Butter and Cheese; but in the violent hot Countries they want that Food, by reason that the Excessive Heats hinder the Milk as well from thickning as turning. Al∣so their manner of Grinding is both very difficult and very laborious, for they put the Grain into a dish, and rub it round about with a wodden Pestel till it be all bruis'd; afterwards they sift it, and make Bread of the Flower: this is proper∣ly the Maids and the Womens work, so that you cannot com∣pel the Servants to this sort of Labour: but the Men wash their leathern, or woollen Clothes if they have any them∣selves, for Linnen is very scarce; and indeed the general Co∣verings of their Nakedness, are the Skins of their own Beasts.</P>
<P>Their Drink is somewhat more dainty, and is the Glory and Consummation of all their Feasts; for so far they still retain the Custom of many of the Ancients, that as soon as the Table is clear'd, they fall to drinking; having always this Proverb in their mouths, <HI>That it is the usual way to Plant first, and then to Water:</HI> they drink themselves up to a merry Pitch, and till their Tongues run before their Wit, and never give off till the Drink be all out. They make excellent <HI>Hydro∣mel</HI>
<PB N="388" REF="185"/>
by reason of their plenty of Honey, which inebriates like Wine, they call it <HI>Tzed;</HI> they make it smaller for their Fa∣milies, mixing six parts of Wine, with one of Water. Ano∣ther sort of Liquor they have of their Fruits; whether an Invention of their own, or that they learnt it from the <HI>Aegyp∣tians,</HI> they call it <HI>Tzal;</HI> and it may be said to be a kind of Ale rather than Beer; as being boyl'd without Hopps, and there∣fore it will not keep: it is white, and sweet, insomuch that our Ale was much more bitter to <HI>Gregories</HI> taste.</P>
<P>Their Apparel is no less mean and poor, only the Princes wear Silk; the Clergy and richer sort make use of Cotton: the poorer sort half-naked, cover themselves with Skins, that hardly hide their privy Parts; which is also common among some of the Nobility and Priesthood: which by the <HI>Europeans</HI> would be lookt upon as a great Scandal, to appear in the Church or the Chancel without Breeches. However the more noble sort wear a kind of Breeches, or rather Trou∣ses down to their heels, yet with such a frugality, that the King is not asham'd of; for from the Waste to the Knees, so far as the cloak covers them, they are only Linnen or else of some courser stuff, and only that which appears below is of Silk: nor are they concern'd though the other be seen as they sit, or Mount their Horses. The Boys and Girls go stark Na∣ked, which the heat of the Country may excuse, yet Pover∣ty is the main occasion; till riper Years calls upon them to hide their Shame; yet then having been so accustomed to go Naked, they the less regard it. But what they want in de∣cent Habit, they endeavour to supply in the Ornament of their Hair, for you may safely say, it is a full year before they Trim and Comb themselves. They not only curl their Hair which makes it grow the streighter, but also anoint it, not with fragrant Balsoms, or Oyles of Amber or Musk, but with Butter; not considering that they who are forc'd to turn their Noses from the stench of their Locks, have not the opportu∣nity to admire the lustre of their Matted Tresses: yet lest an Ornament so slick and glittering should be rumpl'd or squeez'd in the Night, they by means of a most exquisite In∣vention preserve it, resting their Necks in a forked stick, that so their Heads may hang at liberty, preferring their Pride be∣fore Pain and Torture.</P>
<P>Nor does their Poverty less appear in their Houses, for they that belong to the Camp, live all either in Tents, or in
<PB N="389" REF="185"/>
Hurts made up of Reeds and Rubbish, daub'd over with Clay or Lome, and cover'd with Straw or Sedge, which they leave behind them when they remove their Camp with no dammage, or condoling for the loss of their Tenement, when they can as easily build another at the same rate. Not much better are their Villages, scarce secure against the Incursions of the Beasts of Prey. The <HI>Cafers</HI> like Wild Beasts lye with∣out any other Curtains or Canopie than that of Heaven, in the open Field, where Night constrains them to rest. The Kings Houses are of two Fashions, the Longer which are call'd <HI>Sakala;</HI> and the Rounder, which if they be bigger then ordi∣nary, are call'd <HI>Beta Negus,</HI> tho Kings Houses.</P>
<P>They bewail their Dead after a most doleful manner; for no sooner do they hear of the Death of any great Perso∣nage, or any near Friend, but they prostrate themselves upon the Ground, where they lye knocking and bruising their Heads against it, with a cruelty very injurious to their Sculls. The Funeral of <HI>Susneus</HI> as being most Remarkable, I shall here set down, to shew their solemnities in burying their Kings. The Body, being wrapt up and covered with a most rich and cost∣ly Garment, was carryed from <HI>Dancaza,</HI> where the Camp then lay, to the Church call'd <HI>Ganeta—Jesus.</HI> Before the Hearse the Banners and Ensignes were born, not Revers'd, as among us, but upright and display'd, without any <HI>Impreses</HI> or <HI>Motto's,</HI> but only adorn'd with various Colours: the Drums beat slow and mournfully: after them followed Three of the best Horses which the King us'd to Ride, Magnificently capari∣son'd, as if it had been for some Triumphal Pomp: next to them follow'd several of the Noblemens Sons, carrying the Kings Royal Robes, and Ensigns of Regality, as his Di∣adem, his Sword, his Belt, his Spear, his Buckler, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> taking their turns, and by their gestures and postures using all means to excite the People to Tears and Lamentation. To the same End the Queen her self, following at a good distance wore upon her Head her Husbands particular Diadem; ac∣companied with her Daughters and all the Ladies and Vir∣gins of Noble Extraction, all riding upon <HI>Mules,</HI> and having their Tresses cut off: after them followed the Kings Son and Successor, with his Brothers and all the Nobility, some on Horseback, and some on Foot, in old tatter'd Habits, instead of Mourning: no Torches or <HI>Flambeaus</HI> lighted them along in their Procession: no Tapers burning in the Church, nor
<PB N="390" REF="186"/>
was any thing to be heard from one end to the other of it, but Groans and Lamentations, till the Body was laid in the Tomb: only some few <HI>Monks</HI> standing before the Doors of the Church, read some few of the <HI>Psalms</HI> of <HI>David.</HI> Next day they return'd to <HI>Dancaza;</HI> and then so soon as they came in sight of the place, another sort of Pomp was order'd. For the Hearse being brought back again empty, was carry'd first, by which rode a certain Horseman, adorn'd with the Emperours Habit and Robes; and before him rode another upon a Horse richly caparison'd, and arm'd with Helmet and Spear: in which manner after they had proceeded a little way, some certain Bands of Armed Soldiers March'd forth of the Camp to meet them, testifying their Sorrow, by their bitter Lamen∣tations and Howlings. Then the Princes of the Kingdome and chiefest Lords of the Court entring the new Kings Pavil∣lion, renewed their Moans with all expressions of Sorrow, and concluded the Solemnity at length, with congratulations and well-wishes for his happy Government, and prosperous success in all his undertakings.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of their Mechanic Arts and Trades.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Very few Handicrafts. The <HI>Jews</HI> Weavers and Smiths. No Societies of Trades-men. Certain Families of Trumpeters. Architecture formerly known, now forgotten; compar'd with the Ancient <HI>Germans.</HI> Churches and Colledges built by the Fathers of the Societie. The Kings <HI>Palace</HI> Built after the <HI>European</HI> manner, admir'd. They are covetous of Learn∣ing and Sciences. What the King of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> chiefly wants.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ALL this while, there is nothing of which they stand more in need then of Handicraft Trades: for there∣by they are destitute of so many conveniencies of Hu∣man Life, as we abound in by the help of our Arts and Sci∣ences. The <HI>Jews</HI> are almost the only persons that employ themselves among them in weaving of Cotton: they also make the Heads of their Spears and several other pieces of Workmanship in Iron, for they are excellent Smiths; a sort of Trade otherwise abhorr'd by the <HI>Habessines;</HI> which <HI>Gregory</HI> confirm'd with a smile; saying, That the silly vulgar peo∣ple could not endure Smiths, <HI>as being a sort of Mortals that
<PB N="391" REF="186"/>
spit fire, and were bred up in Hell.</HI> As for other things, every one takes Care to supply his own wants either by his own or the pains of his Servants, which it is no hard matter to do; considering how little they have to use. And for the great Men, they have particular men for all their particular Em∣ployments: therefore there are no <HI>Guilds,</HI> or Fraternities of Trades-men among them, which are so frequent in all our Cities, who have their By-laws contriv'd by themselves, more for the good of themselves, than for the benefit of the Commonweale: for amongst us, the skilful and unskil∣full, the just dealer and unjust, are all alike; as be∣ing all under the same By-laws; and they exercise a kind of Monopolie of their Trade, so that their fellow Citizens are as it were Forraigners among them, and compell'd to obey their Injunctions. But in <HI>Habessinia,</HI> what ever Art any one Professes, that he teaches his Children. The <HI>Trumpeters</HI> and <HI>Horn-winders</HI> are all of the same Families, and have their particular Country and Mansions by themselves. Formerly <HI>Architecture,</HI> as it was in request, so it was an Art well known among them, as is evident by the Ruines of the City of <HI>Axuma,</HI> and the Structures of Magnificent Temples cut out of the Live Stone Rocks: but the Imperial Seat being removed into <HI>Amhara,</HI> it grew out of date. For the Kings having deserted <HI>Axuma,</HI> by reason of their long and frequent Marches being accustomed to their Camps, rather chose to abide in Tents and Pavillions. Besides that, after the havocks of the <HI>Adelan</HI> Wars, and the Invasions of the <HI>Gallans,</HI> found that the <HI>Ca∣verns</HI> and <HI>Recesses</HI> of their Inaccessible Mountains were far more safe and convenient and better shelter then sumptuous Palaces. Therefore what <HI>Tacitus</HI> hath written concerning our Ancient <HI>Germans,</HI> may be rightly apply'd to the <HI>Habessines. It is sufficiently known, that Cities are not inhabited by any of the</HI> Habessine <HI>People, neither do they permit contiguous Buildings among them. They place their Villages not as we do, building our Houses close one to another; but every one encompasses to himself a space of ground peculiar to his Habitation, whether to prevent the accidents of Fire, or whether it be their ignorance in the Art of Building. They neither use Cement or Tiles, the whole composure of their Fa∣bricks, being all of rude and Course Materials, without the least ap∣pearance of Elegancy or Ornament.</HI></P>
<P>But the Fathers of the Societies, having design'd their <HI>Eu∣ropean</HI> Structures before, carry'd an <HI>Architect</HI> with them out of
<PB N="392" REF="187"/>
<HI>India,</HI> and having found out Lime, unknown to the <HI>Habessines</HI> for so many Ages, built their Churches and their Colledges of Stone and Mortar, and encompass'd them with High-walls, to the amazement and dread of the <HI>Habessines,</HI> lest they should in time be made so many Impregnable Forts and Castles. But there was nothing which they so much admir'd as the Palace which they built for the King; of which the chief Architect was <HI>Peter Pays,</HI> both Labourer and Work-master, both Surveyer, Carpenter, and Mason himself, and In∣structor of others. A Work which afterwards the People from all parts of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> far and near flock't to see. How∣ever that the <HI>Habessines</HI> have a great desire to learn all those Arts and Sciences which are necessary both in Peace and War, is apparent by King <HI>David</HI>'s Letter to <HI>John</HI> the Third King of <HI>Portugal,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Alvar.</HI> Tom. 2. Hispan. illustrat. <HI>p.</HI> 1297.</NOTE> wherein he desires of the King to send him <HI>Prin∣ters, Armorers, Cutlers, Physitians, Chirurgians, Architects, Carpen∣ters, Goldsmiths, Miners, Bricklayers, and Jewellers. Ernestus</HI> also, Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> demanding of <HI>Gregory, What the King of</HI> Ha∣bessinia <HI>most desir'd out of</HI> Europe? made answer, <HI>Tebebat, Arts and Handicraft Trades;</HI> well understanding, that neither Merchandize nor any other Calling could well be follow'd without the help of the Workmans Tool.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of their Journies, and Travelling, as also an Account of the ways to Habessinia.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Pilgrimages now rare. They Travel upon Mules. No Inns or Wagons. Their Hospitality. The way into <HI>Ethiopia</HI> dangerous. An account of the several ways to it.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HOwever in the midst of all this penury of <HI>Exotic</HI> Arts and Conveniencies, the <HI>Habessines</HI> of their own ac∣cord never care to stir out of their Native Coun∣try, as being ignorant of Forraign Languages and Regions; nor can they distinguish between the <HI>European</HI> Nations, which they believe to be all <HI>Franks,</HI> and their Religion the <HI>Latine Worship;</HI> only they can tell the <HI>English</HI> from the <HI>Dutch</HI> Mer∣chants. Neither do they understand the way of Exchange,
<PB N="393" REF="187"/>
or keeping Correspondence: Besides, they are deterr'd by their own Poverty from undertaking such dangerous Jour∣neys through so many uncouth Deserts.</P>
<P>Formerly indeed they frequently made their holy Pilgri∣mages to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and so back again to <HI>Rome,</HI> when the <HI>Mamalucks</HI> were Lords of <HI>Egypt;</HI> their Government being more gentle, and the ways then far less dangerous then after∣wards: but the Covetousness of the <HI>Turks</HI> has quite alter'd the Case, for the Basha's and Governours of the Islands of the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> and the upper <HI>Egypt,</HI> Men for the most part of base and sordid Condition, having bought their Employments at Court with Mony, without any sense of Law or Equity, so torment and vex all sorts of Travellers, and suck the Mer∣chants Purses in such manner, though to the utter impove∣rishing the Subject and utter decay of Trade, have ruin'd all Commerce and Society with those Places: so that the <HI>Ha∣bessines</HI> now very rarely visit <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> and more rarely go to abide there, as they were wont. For though there, they are somewhat more free from the exactions of the Church, yet are they more oppress'd by want; in regard that the Re∣venues settled by the <HI>Habessines</HI> Kings upon Pilgrims in those Parts, are in the hands of the <HI>Turks;</HI> so that unless the Alms of the Place which are very sparing, God knows, support them, hunger presently destroys them.</P>
<P>In their Travelling, they only make use of Mules; neither can any other Creature perform that kindness to Man as they do, over so many craggie Rocks and Mountains, where it is impossible for Waggons, Carts, or Coaches to pass. Their Horses they preserve very charily for War, and Racing. <HI>Gre∣gory</HI> wondred when he saw our cover'd Wains: He call'd that wherein He and I travell'd together <HI>Bet,</HI> a House, and wish'd he had such a one to carry him into <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> The Great Men and richer sort, carry all their Domestick Houshold-stuff along with them upon their Mules; and where Night over-takes 'em, there they pitch their Tents, and kindle Fires about them to skare the Wild Beasts. The poorer sort; when they have occasion to Travel beg upon the Rode; for there is not an Inn to be seen among them; and for Cooks Shops and Ordinaries, they know as little what belongs to them. Upon which happen'd a pleasant accident at <HI>Rome.</HI> Where the simple <HI>Habessines</HI> newly arriv'd out of the <HI>East,</HI> being walking in the <HI>Suburbs,</HI> were invited by a Cook into
<PB N="394" REF="188"/>
his Shop. They believing all Invitations to be made <HI>gratis,</HI> at first admir'd the Hospitallity of the Man; but then consider∣ing, that it might be done out of Curiosity, to see and discourse with strangers, went into the Shop, and very chearfully ac∣cepted of what was set before them: but at length, when they were going away, they consulted together for Phrase and Language to return their thanks to so kind an Host for his liberal Entertainment, which one among the rest, who best understood the Language was to deliver to the Cook in the behalf of his Companions. The Cook having listen'd a while to their Learned Speech, and not hearing a word of any Mony, without any respect to the smoothness of their Language, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> said he, <HI>who pays?</HI> The <HI>Habessines</HI> like Men Astonish'd made answer, <HI>That they came not into his Shop of their own accord, but by his Invitation, without any mention made of Expectancy of Payment; and that he, when he set his Wine and his Meat before them, never bargain'd for any Money, for that was the very thing they wanted.</HI> But all this would not satisfie the Cook, who forc'd them to leave their Cloaks in Pawn, which were afterwards redeem'd at the <HI>Popes</HI> Charity, which made the Courtiers not a little Merry.</P>
<P>However the <HI>Habessines</HI> themselves are not ignorant of Hospitality, for that in their Villages they appoint the Chief∣est of the Inhabitants for the Relief of the Poor: and in∣deed the Exercise of Hospitallity is highly recommended by the <HI>Apostolical Doctrine,</HI> for the Relief of poor People driven from their abodes by the misfortunes of War, or other Ca∣lamities. Nor were our Ancestors defective in their Christi∣an Charity, as having founded several Magnificent Pallaces, and endowed them with ample Revenues, were they but employ'd according to the Founders Design.</P>
<P>And here it may be very proper to set down the several ways that lead into <HI>Ethiopia</HI> by Land, and where they that go by Sea are to put in for a Landing Place.</P>
<P>The way from <HI>Egypt</HI> into <HI>Habessinia</HI> is most troublesome, difficult, and subject to many dangers, as well by reason of the Extortions of the <HI>Turks,</HI> the Robberies committed by several vagabond Nations, through which they are to pass, and the unwholesomness of the Climates; though formerly when those Kingdoms and Satrapies were under a stricter Government, the Passage was safe enough, and more frequen∣ted. Nevertheless there are at this day several Troops of
<PB N="395" REF="188"/>
Merchants, who setting out from <HI>Gran Caire,</HI> are carry'd up the <HI>Nile</HI> against the Stream as far as <HI>Monfallot,</HI> and thence Tra∣velling in <HI>Caravans,</HI> first come to <HI>Sijut,</HI> and so in order to the following Towns.</P>

<P>In Travelling from <HI>Wacha</HI> to <HI>Sennaar,</HI> the Merchants staying in many places about the affairs of their Traffick, are wont to spend Three whole Months, though it might be done in a far shorter time, without stop or lett. From <HI>Senna∣ar</HI> in Fourteen days time they arrive at the Confines of <HI>Ha∣bessinia.</HI> The Entrance is call'd <HI>Tshelga;</HI> but the safest and shortest Cut is through the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> so you can agree with the <HI>Turks;</HI> this Passage is Two-fold, for either the Merchants set out from <HI>Caire</HI> for <HI>Suesso</HI> a Port upon the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> from whence they set Sail for <HI>Gidda</HI> another Port upon the same Sea; from thence they set Sail again for <HI>Suaqena</HI> and <HI>Mat∣zua;</HI> or if they cannot so long brook the Sea, they mount against the Stream from <HI>Cairo</HI> to <HI>Girgea,</HI> then by Land they travel to <HI>Gidda</HI> in Two days, thence to <HI>Alcossir</HI> in Four days,
<PB N="396" REF="189"/>
where they take Shipping for <HI>Gidda,</HI> and so to <HI>Suaqena,</HI> &amp;c. This way the Metropolitans use to take, as did <HI>Abdelmesih</HI> in the Year 1662. with whom it is the safest Travelling, if any of the <HI>Europeans</HI> are desirous to visit <HI>Abassia. Michael,</HI> the <HI>Ha∣bessinian</HI> Embassadour to the Emperour of the <HI>Turks,</HI> told <HI>Thevenot,</HI> That a Man may reach from <HI>Guendra</HI> to the Island of <HI>Suaqena</HI> in a Fortnight; and from hence, in forty or fifty days to <HI>Grand Cairo</HI> by Land. So that to Travel from the <HI>Royal Camp</HI> to <HI>Grand Cairo,</HI> will take up three Months. There is another way by Sea, round about <HI>Africa;</HI> but then you put in to some Port of <HI>Africa,</HI> that so you may take your op∣portunity to get into the <HI>Persian Gulph:</HI> Many would prefer this way as most facile, tho tedious and troublesom had the <HI>Habessines</HI> any Sea Port at their Command. They that have business at <HI>Moccha</HI> in <HI>Arabia,</HI> have the advantage of crossing over to <HI>Matzua</HI> that lyes over against it; and so from <HI>Arkiko</HI> the Passage lies easie: nor do they amiss that make for <HI>Baylur</HI> a Sea Port belonging to the King of <HI>Denkala,</HI> in Amity with the <HI>Habessines;</HI> only the Journey by Land from thence is tedi∣ous and very much infested by the Robberies of the <HI>Gallans;</HI> though they that can Travel with a good Band of Musque∣teers need little fear them.</P>
<P><HI>Zeyla</HI> a Port belonging to the <HI>Adelans</HI> is more Remote, and altogether unsafe, because of the deadly hatred between them and the <HI>Habessines;</HI> as two of the Fathers of the Society found true. For mistaking this Port, for that of <HI>Baylur,</HI> they paid for their mistake with the loss of their Heads. The other more <HI>Southern</HI> Ports as <HI>Melinda, Magodosh,</HI> &amp;c. are too far di∣stant from the <HI>Habessines;</HI> besides the whole Region is Inha∣bited with none but wild and savage People, whose petty Princes are in continual Wars one with another, and exercise their Fury against all Strangers as Spies, nor are there any Guides to be found.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of the Merchandize, and Exchange of Merchan∣dize in <HI>Habessinia.</HI></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The <HI>Arabians</HI> chiefly, next the <HI>Armenians</HI> the chief Merchants; all bargains by Exchange, of Gold, Iron, Salt. What Goods Exported, what Imported.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FRom what hath been said, it appears that the <HI>Ethiopi∣ans</HI> are no way addicted or expert in the Art and In∣treagues of Merchandizing; for they that will not Travel into Forraign Parts must yield their gains to others; for gain is to be sought, not coming of it self. Therefore the <HI>Arabians</HI> who Inhabit the Ports of the <HI>Red Sea;</HI> espe∣cially, the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> scattered over the Kingdom, are the Chief Merchants in <HI>Habessinia,</HI> for being of the same Reli∣gion they have the free liberty of all the Ports of the <HI>Red Sea:</HI> next to these the <HI>Armenians,</HI> not much differing in their Form of Worship, from the <HI>Abessines,</HI> carry the greatest Trade, as be∣ing great Dealers in all parts of the World. They Import sundry sorts of Commodities, but carry out all the Gold; that 'tis no wonder the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> should be so poor: for neither Gold nor Silver is imported into their Country, but only an Exchange is made for <HI>Indian</HI> Wares. And then be∣cause there is no Money coin'd in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> the more silly and ignorant sort of People, because they come easily by their Gold, as finding it among the Sand, or at the Roots of Trees, let it go again at low Rates. For if the Merchant de∣ny it to be good, they exchange it for as much as they can get, never questioning the Merchants exception. But the Nobility and more cunning sort, carry a Touch-stone always about 'em, with which they try their Gold, then weigh it out, and pay it by the Ounce. The <HI>Ethiopic Vaket,</HI> or Ounce amounts, as <HI>Gregory</HI> told me, to the value of the <HI>Spanish Patacoon,</HI> or our Imperial <HI>Dollar:</HI> Therefore it is, that Exchange is far more frequent in <HI>Habessinia,</HI> then buying and selling; which Ex∣change is made with Iron sometimes, but chiefly for Salt hewn out of the Mountains; which in most Countrys supplies the Place of Mony, with which you may purchase all things. In the more remote Parts of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> you may buy a good
<PB N="398" REF="190"/>
<HI>Mule</HI> with two or three Bricks of that Salt. Formerly Pepper had the same pre-eminence.</P>
<P>The Commodities Imported, are <HI>Babylonian</HI> Garments of all sorts, Velvet, Silken; but chiefly Woollen and Fustian, which the great Men wear instead of Purple, which at this day they have lost the skill of Dying. Spices, and especially Pepper they covet to season their insipid Dyet. Wares for Exportation they have few, besides Gold, Skins, Hides, Wax, Honey, and Ivory: scarce any thing else remarkable. Many more they certainly might have, did the <HI>Habessinian</HI> Kings encourage Traffick and Merchandizing, and if the Country were more commodious for Carriage. The best Merchan∣dize in <HI>Habessinia,</HI> and most important for the Prince, were a more cultivated Ingenuity of the People; together with a perfect knowledge of the Latine Language, together with addition of our Arts, and Handicraft Trades, which would advance the Affairs of those poor Christians to a more flou∣rishing Estate, and weaken the strength of the <HI>Barbarians.</HI></P>
<P>The Almighty God stir up the Hearts of our Princes, to lend their Assistance to this Ancient Christian Nation, which might prove so useful to Propagate Christianity in those Re∣mote Parts of the World; and so glorious to themselves and their Posterity.</P>
