<HEAD>A LETTER <HI>VVRIT∣TEN TO THE RIGHT</HI> worshipfull the Gouernours and <HI>Assistants of the East Indian Mar∣chants</HI> in London; containing the estate <HI>of the East Indian Fleete, with the names</HI> of the chiefe men of note dead <HI>in the Voyage.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">R</SEG>Ight Worshipfull my dutie re∣membred. It may please you to vnderstand, that we wayed An∣chor the 20. of Aprill 1601. and set saile out of <HI>Torbaye</HI> by <HI>Dart∣mouthe.</HI></P>
<P>The 21. of Iune following, being in the heigth of three degrees to the Northwards of the line, wee tooke a ship of <HI>Vianna</HI> bound for <HI>Brasill,</HI> of the burthen of 130. tunne, her lading was Wine, Oyle and Meale, which hath stood vs in
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>great steede in this our voyage: fiue or sixe dayes after we turned her off after we had pillaged her as we thought good.</P>
<P>The 20. day of Iuly we turned away the <HI>Guifte</HI> beeing in the height of 19. degrees to the South∣ward of the Line, the 24. day we came vnder the Tropicke of <HI>Capricorne.</HI></P>
<P>The 19. day of September we came to Anchor at <HI>Saldaiua,</HI> beeing in very great distresse by reason of the scuruy disease then raging among vs. The <HI>Ascention</HI> and <HI>Susans</HI> company were scarce able to let fall their Anchors without the helpe of other ships, there we staied and refreshed our men with fresh victuals, as Beefe and Mutton in great aboun∣dance which cost vs little or nothing, there we stai∣ed about seauen weekes, and had staied there lon∣ger if the inhabitantes had continued to bring vs fresh victuals, so we departed thence the 9. of Oc∣tober.</P>
<P>The 29. of December we came to Anchor in the baye of <HI>Antoga,</HI> here we trucked with the inha∣bitants for Rice, Lemmans and Plantaines &amp; such like fruite, we sette vp one of our Pinnaces: here al∣so we lost diuerse of our men which dyed of the
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>Filx by reason of the great heate, and feeding of the Plantaines and Lemmans which they did de∣uoure immoderately.</P>
<P>This Baye is the Inland of <HI>Saint Laurence</HI> and standeth in the height of sixeteene degrees.</P>
<P>The 4. day of March we departed thence in the euening, and the first day of Iune 1602. we discried the land <HI>Sumatra.</HI></P>
<P>The 3. day we Anchored in the Roade of <HI>A∣chin</HI> in seauen faddome water. To make any large discourse of matters which passed whilst wee lay in the Roade of <HI>Achin</HI> I omitte, because time will not permitte: But in few wordes you shall vnderstand, that heere wee found little Pepper, not sufficient to loade the <HI>Ascention,</HI> hauing in her little aboue eight score tunnes, we could not I thinke in all the East <HI>Indiaes</HI> haue come to a worser place for loading.</P>
<P>The 30. of Iuly the Generall sent away the <HI>Su∣san</HI> to <HI>Priaman</HI> to seeke her loading, being an Iland which lieth towardes the southwardes eight score leagues, a little distance from <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and about 20. dayes before our comming to <HI>Achin,</HI> the little
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>Pinnace came from her and certified our generall she was almost loaden, that we hope she will not be long after vs.</P>
<P>The 11. of September we departed out of the roade of <HI>Achin</HI> for the straights of <HI>Mallaca</HI> to seeke purchase: The Red <HI>Dragon, the Assention,</HI> the <HI>Hector</HI> and a Flemming which came into the Roade os <HI>A∣chin</HI> but 4. dayes before.</P>
<P>The 3. of October beeing Sunday about fiue of the clocke in the afternoone we saw a saile and gaue her chase, about nine of the clocke wee fetched her vp and hayled her, and found her to be a Ship come from <HI>Goa</HI> and bound for <HI>Mallaca</HI> laden with <HI>Portingals</HI> goodes, as <HI>Pintados, Calicottes</HI> and other stuffes great store, a great part of her loading was Rice and victualls, and in her about seauen or eight hundred persons men women and children, we had out of her <HI>958.</HI> Fardils: and diuers chests with other things as <HI>Canistees:</HI> wee were forced from her by force of weather beeing put from our Anchors.</P>
<P>The 25. day we Anchored in the roade of <HI>A∣chin.</HI></P>
<P>The 11. day of Nouember being Thurseday we waied our Anchors and set saile from <HI>Achin, viz.</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>the <HI>Dragon,</HI> the <HI>Hector,</HI> and a little Pinnace, and the <HI>Ascention,</HI> they did keepe vs company till the next day being bound for <HI>Priaman</HI> vnto the <HI>Susan,</HI> and so from thence they were purposed to goe for <HI>Ban∣tam,</HI> God grant they may get thither in safety, for then it is not to be doubted they shall get their full lading of Pepper according to their desires, as shall appeare vnto you hereafter: So wee leauing them the day aboue said, departed for <HI>England,</HI> to the great reioycing of vs all that were to goe home into out Country after so tedious a pilgrimage.</P>
<P>The 3. day of Februarie about 10. of the clocke afore noone, wee had sight of the <HI>Cape Bona esper∣anse</HI> a Frenchman which we left in the roade of <HI>A∣chin</HI> being in our company, which came out a day after vs, who together had determined to goe for <HI>Saldauia</HI> if two Flemmings who came then into our company had not altered our determination, for af∣ter wee had hailed them, wee vnderstood they were vnwilling to put in for that place, but to goe for <HI>Saint Hellena,</HI> so we stoode along with them, and altogether ariued at <HI>Saint Hellena.</HI></P>
<P>The 21. day of the same month, the <HI>Ascenti∣on</HI> and the Frenchman called the <HI>Creset</HI> of <HI>Saint Mallowes,</HI> the two Dutchmen, the Admirall was called the Amsterdam about the burthen of
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>300. <HI>Last,</HI> and the other called the <HI>Tergow,</HI> of the bignesse of the <HI>Ascention:</HI> which shippe hath beene almost thirty three monethes from home, and as they tould vs laden at <HI>Petauia,</HI> most of her lading beeing Pepper, and in their way homeward they touched at <HI>Banton,</HI> the people of <HI>Banton</HI> were glad when they came thither because they thought they woulde haue laden Pepper, hauing great store lying vpon their hands and being chea∣per then ours is.</P>
<P>The generall of the Flemmings whose name is <HI>Iacob Cornelius Van Neskes</HI> toulde vs that there is Pepper enough to lade foure or fiue Ships, so that if the <HI>Dragon</HI> came there in any time con∣uenient it is not to bee doubted but they are vppon the waye homewardes full laden with Pepper, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Frenchmen haue determined suddaine∣ly to leaue our companye to depart homewardes, which hath made mee to trouble you with this discourse, although not so large as willingly I would it were, for that time will not per∣mitte mee to doe otherwise, hoping that it will not bee any thing displeasing vnto you, hauing as I thinke not before this heard any cer∣tainety
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>of vs since our departure out of England beeing verie willing it should come to your hands before you heare of vs any more, the better to prepare your mindes for the setting foorth of a new voyage. Wee shall bee readye to de∣parte from hence the fifteenth day of this moneth of March, GOD send vs home in safetye.</P>
