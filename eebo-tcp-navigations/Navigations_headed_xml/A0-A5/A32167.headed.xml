<P>That for the Elucidation of that Act which the King of <HI>Great Britain</HI> caused to be published in the year 1660. <HI>For the Encouragement of Navigation</HI> in his own Subjects, whereby strangers are prohibited to import any Commodities into <HI>England,</HI> but such as are of their own growth or Manufacture; it may be lawful for the States General, and their Subjects, to carry al∣so into <HI>England</HI> in their Ships, all such Commodities as growing, being produced, or manufactured in Lower or Upper <HI>Germany,</HI> are not usually carried so frequent∣ly and commodiously unto Sea-Ports (thence to be transported to other Countries) any other way but through the Territories and Dominions of the United <HI>Netherlands,</HI> either by Land or by Rivers.</P>
