<P>MY chief aim in Publish∣ing this small Piece, is for the benefit of Sea∣men, who is known to be the chief Bulwark of our Kingdoms,
<PB REF="4"/> and upon whose undaunted Cou∣rage, Resolution and Conduct, our Liberties and Properties wholly depend; who vindicate our Rights with the expence of their dearest Blood.

<P>I don't mean there is any un∣just thing put upon them by their Superior Officers, who has a paternal care over them, but

<P>EVery Artist knows, That the Art of <HI>Navigation</HI> consisteth chiefly in Arithmetick; and because <HI>Decimal Fractions</HI> is so much wanting, and so little used amongst Seamen, it will
<PB N="2" REF="7"/> not be amiss to go through all the Rules thereof, and then shew the use of each Rule in its proper place; so that the ingenious Artist may with a great deal of Facility go through that long and tedious Work, often occasi∣oned by Vulgar Fractions: Not but that I leave every Man to his own fancy, to use that which he in his own Opinion thinks best.</P>
<P>It's true, <HI>Vulgar Fractions</HI> is unavoidable in some Cases, but in that which is chiefly design'd here, <HI>Decimal Fractions</HI> may be used in every respect easier and more correct than <HI>Vulgar.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of Decimal Arithmetick. Notation of Decimals.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Decimal</HI> is that by which is distin∣guished the Parts of a Unite: And is decreased from Unity to so ma∣ny Tenth Parts of a Unite. For Uni∣ty is divided into ten parts, and every tenth part is called a Prime, every hund∣redth part is a Second, and every thou∣sand part a third, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So as whole Numbers increase by Tens from the Unites place towards the left hand, so Decimals decrease by Tens from the Unites Place towards the right hand, as may appear by the following Example.</P>

<P>For 10 Primes is one Unite, and 10 Seconds is one Prime, and 10 Thirds is one Second, and 10 Fourths is one Third, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So that every place towards the left, is ten times less than the preceding Figure: For preponing of Cyphers, lessen the following Figure in a tenfold manner; for (.2) is two Primes, or two Tenths of an Integer or Unite, but (.02) is but two Seconds, or two hun∣dreth parts of an Unite. Cyphers after a Decimal neither augment nor dimi∣nish the value of the Decimal.</P>
<P>A Decimal is always distinguished from a whole Number by a Prick or Period, as in the Numbers following.</P>

<P>It is very hard for the Learner to know the value of this Total, being he is not come the length of Multiplication, which is the only Rule useful in this case. The general Rule is, every Prime or Unite in the Total Sum is 2 shillings value, and every 5 Seconds is one shilling, and the superplus of the Seconds above 5 is so many ten farthings, and the number of Digits in the thirds place is so many farthings: All the rest of the Decimals to the right being of no value. The .2 Primes in the Total is 4 shillings, and the 5 Seconds of the seven is one shilling, and the two remaining is 20 farthings; the 9 Thirds added thereto makes 29 farthings, which is 7 pence farthing: but by reason the number is above 25, the
<PB N="8" REF="10"/> farthing must be cut off. The sum is 5 shill. and 7 pence.</P>

<HEAD>Multiplication of Decimals.</HEAD>
<P>In Multiplication of Decimals, the method is the same as in whole Numbers; only you are to prick off so many Decimals towards the right hand in the Product, as there is Deci∣mals in both Multiplicator and Multi∣plicand: As suppose I were to multi∣ply 26.75 by 35, there must be two Decimals prickt off in the Product, by reason there is two in the Multiplicand.</P>

<P>Would not one think it very strange a Decimal Fraction divided by a Decimal Fraction, should bring forth a whole Number in the Quotient. But I shall make it very plain, that it must be so and no otherways, by a reasonable De∣monstration.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>
<P>By the first Example, you see I di∣vide .900 by .05, and the Quotient I find to be 18.0, that is, because there is three Decimals in the Dividend and one in the Divisor, I make up the number of those in the Dividend, by taking one Decimal from the Quotient, and adding to the 2 in the Divisor.</P>
<P>Now the nature of the Question is thus: I desire to know how many times 5 Seconds in 9 Primes? The Answer is 18. For there is 18 times 5 Seconds in 9 Primes.</P>
<P>If it fall out at any time, that there is not so many Figures in the Quotient, as will make these in the Divisor equal in Number to those in the Dividend; then you must prepone Cyphers before the Quotient to the left hand, as in the following Example.</P>

<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
<P>I shall give you an Example as to the Use and Application of Division of Decimal Fractions, to the end that those who intend to use Decimals may the better understand what they are go∣ing about.</P>
<P>Suppose I were to divide 10 shillings amongst 20 Men, the Decimal for 10 shillings is .50; therefore I divide my Decimal .50 by the number of Men 20, and the Quotient will be .025, which is the Decimal equal to 6 pence; for if you multiply .025 by 12, and double the Product, it will be 6 pence.</P>
<P>I could give several Examples of this kind, but the various Examples that will happen in the following work, will in its proper place, give a clearer De∣monstration than can be here expected; so I shall refer the Learner to the prac∣tice in General, and proceed to my in∣tended work.</P>

<P>BEfore we proceed to the Rigging of a Ship, it is proper we should know her Burthen; they having a dependency upon each other. For you can't know how to Rigg a Ship without you know the length and breadth of her, no more than you can know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Burthen; but when she is once R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d (if according to Art or Proportion) you may know her Burthen without taking the length and breadth: Therefore I say, we shall begin gradually first to know her Burthen, and so go on.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>To find the Burthen of any Ship.</HEAD>
<P>Take the length of the Koel, and the breadth of the Beam, from Plank to Plank, and multiply the one by the o∣ther, and the Product multiply by the depth of the Hold; and the last Product divide by 100, and the Quotient is the Burthen of a Ship; or, to save the trou∣ble

<P>We shall begin with the Main-mast of a Ship, whose length of Keel is 73. Foot, breadth of the Beam 28.5 Foot, the depth of the Hold 12. Foot.</P>
<P>The only Rule to find the length of the Main-mast, is to add the breadth of the Beam and the depth of the Hold toge∣ther, and divide the Product by 1.5, and the Quotient is the Yards in length; the Main-mast of the Ship must be,</P>

<P>The length of the Main-mast sought is 27 Yards or 81 Foot.</P>
<PB N="41" REF="27"/>
<P>Those that are not very expert at Di∣vision, may make use of the following Multiplicator, which will perform the fame as the Division does, and will be a great deal easier for the Learner, if he do but observe to prick off the De∣cimals to the Right hand, as is directed in the foregoing Work.</P>
<P><HI>Example.</HI></P>
<P>The Sum of the breadth and depth is 40.5, the which I multiply by the proper Multiplicator .6666, and the Product is 26.99730 which is 26 yard, and 99 hundredth parts of a yard, which wants not one second to make it 28 yards, equal to the former Work.</P>
<P>To find the thickness of the forego∣ing Mast or any other mast of the Ship, you are to take the length of the Mast mentioned in the foregoing Table, and say by the Rule of Proportion,</P>
<P>If 84 give 28 (as in the Table) what will 81 give.</P>

<P>Here we find the thickness of the Main-mast of the propounded Ship to be 27 foot; now to find the thickness or length of the other Masts of the same Ship.</P>
<P>If for the Thickness of any of the Masts, you must it work by the foregoing Rule, taking out the length of the Mast you require from the foregoing Table; and as the length there requires so much, what will the length found require?</P>
<P>You must find your lengths of the se∣veral Masts and Yards by the Rule be∣fore directed.</P>
<P>Suppose I was to find the length of the Fore-mast, having the length of the Main-mast; I multiply the length of the Main-mast by 8, and divides the Product by 9, and the Quotient is the length of the Fore-mast required.</P>

<P>As for Example, the length of my Main-mast is 81 Foot, the which I multiply by 8, and divides by 9, and the Quotient is 72, the length of the Fore-mast sought.</P>
<P>Now, if you would have the length of the Mizon-mast, being that it is ¾ the length of the Fore-mast; you must multiply the length of the Fore-mast by 3, and divide the Product by 4, and the Quotient is the length of the Mizon-mast; the Fore-Yard is in proportion to the Main-yard, as the Fore-mast is in proportion to the Main-mast.</P>
<P>Thus we have inserted most material things as to a Ships Rigging: but be∣cause the way here inserted will be troublesome and tedious, unless to some Artists who take pleasure therein, we shall set down a plain and easy way, by which any Ship may be Rigg'd with a great deal of ease: And shall be as fol∣lows.</P>

<P>After you have Victualled and Indent∣ed, you must set it down in your Book for that purpose, and keep your Debtors part together, that you may give a due charge to the Surveyor of Victualling, when you come to pass your Account.</P>
