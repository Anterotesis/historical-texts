<P>FOR THE BILL AGAINST <HI>Clandestine Trade.</HI></P>
</DIV1>

<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="text">
<PB REF="1" MS="y"/>
<HEAD><HI>Fair Trade,</HI> besides the Heavy Duties it lies under, suffers yet more from the <HI>Frauds</HI> of <HI>Smuglers</HI> and the <HI>Exactions</HI> of <HI>Officers,</HI> for preventing both which, the <HI>BILL</HI> before the <HI>House</HI> is Calculated so that 'tis no wonder if the Pri∣vate Interests of <HI>Clandestine Traders</HI> and <HI>Officers,</HI> should unite, in raising a Clamour against it.</HEAD>
<P><TABLE>
<ROW>
<CELL ROLE="label">The <HI>Clauses</HI> whereof are to the Effect following.</CELL>
<CELL ROLE="label"> </CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>1. THAT all Ships under just suspicion of an Irregular Trade, by hover∣ing and remaining unnecessarily near the Shore, should be subject to a Search, and the Master obliged to declare his Consignment.</CELL>
<CELL>SUCH Declaration of the Master, is no more than what is already required from all who come into Port, and this Clause will not delay any Ship which duly pro∣secutes her Voyage, or prevent taking in ne∣cessary Supplies.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>2. The second Clause subjects all Persons any way aiding or assisting in Smugling, to a Penalty, and also forfeits the Horses or Car∣riages imployed in such Service.</CELL>
<CELL>This was in the French Prohibition Act, and the speedy Conviction, will make it more Ef∣fectual, as well as more Useful, to the Poor.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>3, 4, 5. The third, fourth, and fifth Clau∣ses require the Making True Entries, with re∣ference to the Countrey, and also the Proper∣ty of the Goods, under a Penalty, on any Prevarication.</CELL>
<CELL>This necessary to prevent Colouring French or Aliens Goods, under other Names; but if the Swearing <HI>Toties Quoties</HI> be objected to, a General Oath may suffice instead of it.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>6. The sixth Clause provides for the Secu∣rity of Goods casually cast on Shore, till the Duties are paid.</CELL>
<CELL>The King's Interest in such Goods, would help to preserve the Subjects Right better than it would be otherwise.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>7. Brandy in small Casks, or Salt in Bags, to be forfeited, if found on board Ships pre∣tending to be bound to <HI>Ireland,</HI> or the Neigh∣bouring Islands, as well as if Imported to <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></CELL>
<CELL>This Clause makes the Smugling more diffi∣cult in these Instances, wherein it was before too frequently practised.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>8. No House to be broken open in Search of Uncustomed Goods, but on fresh Pursuit, or Information upon Oath, and the Informer to have Equal Share with the Officer.</CELL>
<CELL>'Tis no unusual Practice for Merchants to di∣sturb one another in the same Trade, by whi∣spering Stories to Officers, without any Foun∣dation, which is a great Mischief, when it goes so far as to break into Houses. The other part is for Encouraging Just Informations.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>9. All Merchants to be Civilly treated and diligently dispatched, on pain of suspending the Officer who neglects his Duty herein. That is in dispatching due Certificates of Over En∣tries or Damage; and Post Entries to be a∣voided as much as is possible.</CELL>
<CELL>The Fundamental Security to the Revenue arises from the Obligation upon Merchants to enter their Goods before they land them; And all Short Entries under Colour of Damage or any other Pretence whatsoever, subjects so much to Frauds by Collusive Practices with the Officers at the Water-side.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>10. Goods brought to the Ware-house at the Merchants desire, for securing the Duty to be entred in a certain time, or the Ware∣house room to be paid for.</CELL>
<CELL>This only to oblige the Merchants to di∣spatch the Entring their Goods, in order to clear the Kings Ware-house.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL><PB REF="2"/> 11. Wines to be Imported in Certain Cask, on pain of Losing the 12 <HI>per Cent.</HI> for Leakage, and to be obliged to enter as fill'd up, gaug∣ing the Wine if otherwise Imported.</CELL>
<CELL>The Rule in the Book of Rates, which al∣lows Outs, supposes Certain Cask, and the Mer∣chant who had before his Election on the En∣try, Whether to Enter fill'd or unfill'd; will have it now on the Importation.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>12. Damaged Tobacco to be destroyed, on certain Conditions.</CELL>
<CELL>The partiality of Officers in the Allowances for Damage, is a great Discouragement to Fair Trade, which this Clause prevents, as well as prejudice to the Subject, by the Mix∣ing of Unwholsom Tobacco with Sound: and if the like Practice might be used to Unsound Wines, it would probably have the same good Effect every way.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>13. No Person to be admitted to Claim any Goods seized, without giving Security to an∣swer Costs of Suit.</CELL>
<CELL>This to prevent Sham-Claims of Persons no way interested in the Property of the Goods.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>14. No Goods to be carried Coast-ways without a Custom-house Dispatch, or Landed, but in presence of an Officer.</CELL>
<CELL ROWS="3">These Three Clauses necessary to prevent the Frauds usually practised in the Coast Trade.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>15. Fisher Boats, Coal Ships, or other Coast∣ing Vessels, taking in any Uncustomed or Prohibited, or Certificat Goods at Sea, with∣out Warrant, shall be forfeited, unless in Ca∣ses of absolute necessity.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>16. Foreign Goods carried up the Naviga∣ble Rivers, shall have Custom-house Di∣spatches, as if carried from Port to Port.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>17. Endorsed Cocquets to be by Actual En∣dorsement on the first Warrant in all Cases where 'tis practicable.</CELL>
<CELL>This saves the Merchant the unnecessary trouble and charge of Two Entries, and se∣cures the Revenue better from double Ship∣ping of Subsidy Goods and Double Deben∣tures for Certificat Goods.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>18. No Bounty to be paid for Corn Ex∣ported, without the same Proof which the Law already requires, before the Bond be Cancell'd.</CELL>
<CELL>Security being already required for Export∣ing such Corn, the Reason of the Law holds against paying the Bounty, till such Security be duly discharged by a Certificat of the Actual Exportation.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>19. No Ship importing any Foreign Goods shall discharge the same into Lighters, but on a Sufferance with Condition to secure a due Entry of all such Goods.</CELL>
<CELL>The unshipping Goods before Entry creates a Forfeiture in Law; And tho' Trade may be accommodated in this Particular, yet the King's Security should not be lessened.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>20. Officers to be settled in the Isles of <HI>Man, Guernzy,</HI> and <HI>Jerzy,</HI> &amp;c. with Autho∣rities to prevent Irregular Trade.</CELL>
<CELL>Without such Care those Islands may be made Magazines for Plantation and Prohibited Goods, which will be more easily stollen from thence into <HI>England.</HI></CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>21. and 22. Certain enumerated Goods paying very high Duties, as also all <HI>French</HI> and Prohibted Goods being seized and con∣demned to be sold by Inch of Candle; The King to have Two thirds of such Sale, paying the charge of Prosecution, and no Letter of Li∣cence to be granted for Compounding such Seizures.</CELL>
<CELL>The Reason of these Clauses is, that the King's Share by Composition, and even his Moiety of the ordinary Appraisements, comes to less than the Duty on some Goods, which tends to run the Revenue into Forfeiture by Collusive Seizures, wherein the Merchant will find his Account.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL><PB REF="2"/> 23. The Commissioners may compound Petty Seizures only where the Subsidy does not exceed 40 shillings.</CELL>
<CELL>This always allowed in the Commission of the Custom, as supposing the Goods will not answer the Charge of the Prosecution in the <HI>Exchequer;</HI> nevertheless the Practice of it is uneasie to hat Court.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>24. The Register of Ships hitherto requi∣red for such only as trade to the Plantations, to be extended to all <HI>English</HI> Ships trading to any Foreign Parts, in order to preserve the Pri∣vileges intended by the Act of Navigation to <HI>English</HI> Ships and <HI>English</HI> Seamen entire to them.</CELL>
<CELL>This Cluse does only pursue the Inten∣tion of the Act of Navigation, by encoura∣ging the Juilding of Ships in <HI>England,</HI> and employing of <HI>Englilish</HI> Seamen.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>25. Masters of Ships coming from Foreign Parts, tho' pretending to be in Ballast, to make Declaration at the <HI>Custom-house</HI></CELL>
<CELL>That <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Pretence of Ballast may not be a Cover to Fraud, as it proves too often.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>26, &amp; 30. The Commanders of Men of War and Yatchs coming from Foreign Parts, as also Masters of Vessels employed in the Service of the Navy, Victualling, or Tran∣sports, to be subject to Declaration and Rules as well as others.</CELL>
<CELL>This nought to be a necessary Caution, to prevent Opportunities of Smuggling, under Colour of the Publick Service.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>27, 28, 29. The Oaths required from Ma∣sters of Ships to be writ down on the Reports Inwards, and the Contents Outwards, to be Signed by the Masters of the Ships, and to be attested by the proper Officers administring the same respectively.</CELL>
<CELL>The Law already requires the Oath and the making it more solemn, by writing it down to be read and subscribed, before sworn may procure a greater Regard of it.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>31. A Regular Account of all Seizures to be given from time to time to the Commissioners.</CELL>
<CELL>The necessary to prevent Discharges with∣out die Course of Law.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>32. All Bonds duly Certified to be Cancelled, and the Certificate to be annexed to the Bond, to justifie the Officer in Cancelling the same.</CELL>
<CELL>The present Practice, is to return the Bonds into the <HI>Exchequer</HI> without Cancelling; so that if the Certificate happens to be lost, the Mer∣chantis unreasonably prosecuted.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>33. Bonds not duly Certified, to be re∣turned regularly into the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> in or∣der to a Prosecution.</CELL>
<CELL>This no less reasonable than the other, to discourage Irregular Practices.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>34. The Impositions to be accompted for in the <HI>Exchequer</HI> by the Patent-Officers in the Year-Books as well as the Subsidy.</CELL>
<CELL>Those Duties now amounting to more than the Old Subsidy, may deserve as much Care from the Officer in rendring a just Account of then.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>35. Collectors to give in their Quarterly Accounts of Incidents upon Oath, and all Officers to attend diligently at reasonable Hours the Dispatch of Merchants Business.</CELL>
<CELL>The first Part but a reasonable Caution from the Officer, and the other a just Regard to the Accommodation of Trade.</CELL>
</ROW>
</TABLE></P>
<P>Ʋpon the whole Matter, This Bill is of very Publick Concernment: For as there was in the Year ending at <HI>Michaelmas</HI> l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st near 1500000 <HI>l.</HI> in Money received for Duties at the <HI>Custom-house,</HI> and applied to the Discharge of the Debt of the Nation, It is plain that a due Collection of these Duties does not only tend to en∣courage Trade in General, but to ease the Land of every Gentleman in <HI>England</HI> of so much of that Publick Burthen which must otherwise come upon it. And if there be ony one Clause in the whole Bill, which upon due Deliberation shall be found Impracticable or too Rigorous, the Bill being framed as it is by Rules to make it more intelligible in fewer Words, any one of them may be left out without Pre∣judice to the rest, as having no necessary Dependance on, or Connexion with one another.</P>
