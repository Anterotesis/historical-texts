<HEAD>PROLOGUE</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>AFter one Summers being in Arms in vain,</L>
<L>And <HI>Ireland</HI> look't like <HI>Hounslow-Heath</HI> Campaign:</L>
<L>When to drink <HI>Usquebagh,</HI> and pick his Toes,</L>
<L>Mend his pacht <HI>Brogues,</HI> and Mundifie his Cloaths,</L>
<L>Was all Teague had to do, one would have thought,</L>
<L>The <HI>Irish</HI> might to Discipline been brought;</L>
<L>For tho' their Wit and Sense can never Charm ye,</L>
<L>They might have learnt the Language of an Army:</L>
<L>When their great Generals, fam'd beyond the Moon,</L>
<L>Were Deputy King <HI>James,</HI> and Count <HI>Lazune.</HI></L>
<L>The first, (for why should we great Actions bury,)</L>
<L>So famous for his Flight from <HI>Salisbury.</HI></L>
<L>The other who from's Master learnt the Trick</L>
<L>Of Burning Towns, because they're Heretick:</L>
<L>But they learnt only how to fight in jest,</L>
<L>Nay, when they were by greatest dangers prest,</L>
<L>And minding nothing that their Generals say,</L>
<L>But how to face about and run away,</L>
<L>Not Bullies Scouring from the Mid-Night Watch,</L>
<L>Nor needy Debtor from a Serjeants Catch,</L>
<L>Could Faster run, than did the <HI>Irish</HI> Hoast.</L>
<L>When Great King <HI>William</HI> o're the <HI>Boyn</HI> was crost;</L>
<L>Their Abdicated Prince first show'd the way,</L>
<L>And why should they behind their Leader stay?</L>
<L>For he, 'tis said, from Hubbaboos and Hoots,</L>
<L>Rode sixty Mile that day, and spoil'd his Boots.</L>
<L>'Twould be a Jubile at <HI>Rome that Day,</HI></L>
<L>If <HI>James</HI> could learn to fight, as well as Pray.</L>
<L>And I'le affirm't without his Royal Word,</L>
<L>'Tis a good Cause sets th'edge upon a Sword.</L>
<L>But his is such a sneaking little Cause,</L>
<L>And much more Ʋgly, then he made our Laws;</L>
<L>A Cause of such a Tottering sinking Fame,</L>
<L>No Prince e're thriv'd, that undertook the same;</L>
<L>And were there but a worser Place than Hell,</L>
<L>May they be all sent there, that wish it Well.</L>

<P><STAGE>leaning his Arm upon a Table, and resting his Head upon his Knuckles.</STAGE> IT was observ'd, that when I was first crown'd in this Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> my Crown stood like the Steeple of the <HI>Duomo</HI> at <HI>Pisa,</HI> awry upon my Head, which way soever Men lookt upon me. Was that a good Sign, <HI>Hall,</HI> or No?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hall.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose it lean'd toward <HI>England,</HI> Sir, and then 'twas a good sign—I long to be preaching again in your Chappel at <HI>White hall</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>James.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the Mass, and so do I too, to hear thee there— But when I first turn'd Roman-Catholick, I was promis'd Moun∣tains of Gold. Where are those Mountains?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hall.</SPEAKER>
<P>Despair not, Sir; I make no Question, but rather than you shall want, that Heaven will rain Gold for as many days toge∣ther, as it rain'd in the Time of the Flood.</P>

<P>Why so?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hall</SPEAKER>
<P>—Oh Sir—If you would but trust in the Queen of Heaven, I dare be bold to say, she would send you her own Life-Guard to fight without Pay—which would be the same thing, as if she should Coin half the Stars in the Firmament, to make Money for you.</P>

<P>In the mean time what good News, my Lords—How go Affairs in <HI>England</HI>—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>D'Avaux.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's nothing Sir, you are but his <HI>Viceroy</HI> in this King∣dom—consequently none of his Brother—My Master's too Jealous of his Honour to call his Inferiour Brother—</P>

<P>My Lord, I'm sorry for th'occasion—I know indeed the Barons of my Exchequer at <HI>London</HI> may call Baron Tell-clock Brother, but Baron Tell-clock must not call any of them Bro∣thers—Y'are in the Right my Lord <HI>D'Avaux</HI>—I am but a King-Tell-clock in the World at present—But pass it over— I'll undertake my Wife shall make all well again—</P>

<SPEAKER>D'Avaux.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Morthleu!</HI> A Prince of No-land call my Master Brother!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lausun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, my Lord, I think 'twas by you ill tim'd—for you know our Master pretends to assist him as still King of Great Brittain—and therefore I don't believe he would have disown'd the Expression as yet, had it been spoken to his Face—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D'Avaux.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I know as well how our Master intends to Fool him—how he only makes a Tool of him, but despises him in his Heart—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lausun.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's nothing—what a Party would our Master loose both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> and perhaps in this Kingdom too—should he pretend to set up for himself—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D'Avaux.</SPEAKER>
<P>To tell you truth, I think our Master does ill to spend so much Money, Time, and so many Men upon him—For i'my Conscience 'twill all come to nothing—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lausun.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am in a fine case then, to sell so fair an Estate as I have done to follow his Fortune—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D'Avaux.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why look ye Sir—Where Prudence and Courage are wanting, there can never be a Prospect of Success.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lausun.</SPEAKER>
<P>What must we do then?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D'Avaux.</SPEAKER>
<P>Make haste while the Sun shines—Plunder and repay your self, there be good Gleanings still left—Never pity the People, they're a sort of Miscreants not worth hanging.— I have taken that course with the King, as to make him seize all his Protestant Subjects Goods by Armed Force, and then having set a Price upon them at his own Pleasure, which he only pays in his own Copper Money, to export them to our Master his Dear Correspondent in <HI>France.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lausun.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a Faithful and Politick Minister I must con∣fess—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D'Avaux.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tann'd Hides, Raw Hides, Wooll, Tallow and Butter, are all Commodities which my Master wants—and how much of this sort of Merchandize I have got the King to Ship off into <HI>France</HI> this year 1689 d'ye think?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lausun.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot tell my Lord.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D'Avaux.</SPEAKER>
<P>Begar my Lord, no less than Thirty three thousand four hundred fifty eight Hides Tann'd and Raw—Sixty one thousand four hundred and five Stone of Wooll, three hundred eighty nine Tun of Tallow, and Forty Stone of Butter. Good Chaffer, my Lord, in <HI>France;</HI> as being all Staple Commodities, the Exportation of which Beggers the Protestants, the only Indu∣strious People of the Island, and Impoverishes the Kingdom; for which our Master makes no other Returns, but only Materials to Murder the Hereticks, and conquer the Nation for himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lausun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our Master, my Lord, I know is a Prudent Prince, and I make no question but your Lordship has been able to carve sufficiently for your self out of such Lumps as these—But when all's gone, what shall we have for our pains?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D'Avaux.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, my Lord, our Master does not intend to re∣move the Land, there will be Arable and Pasture still left—and you will have your Proportion you may be sure—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lausun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, my Lord, I would fain know which County will fall to my share, because I would be a little kind to my own Tenants—But letting this go—Did you ever see, my Lord, such a Court as this? Not a Lady worth the Salute of <HI>Serviteur Madame</HI>—Their yellow Hair and Freckles would turn the Sto∣mack of the most pumple-fac'd Whore-master in the World— A Man would rather let his Name perish, then lye with 'em to sup∣port his Family—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D'Avaux.</SPEAKER>
<P>Y'are a little too severe my Lord, 'tis true the <HI>Dublin</HI> Ladies want the Wit and Air, the Garb and Demeanour of our Parisian <HI>Belles Filles,</HI> but there are some that will serve for all that, to keep a Man warm in a Frosty Night as well as the best—Then again, my Lord, there's a pleasure in Variety—and many Men as well as my self, love to see what Forraigners have got, as well as their own Native Country-women—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lausun.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very true, my Lord, and I would not willingly be beaten out of the Country, before I had try'd one of these Female <HI>Teagues</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D'Avaux.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have leisure, my Lord—when you lye idle in your own Quarters, you have nothing to do but to be beating up the Womens Quarters—Look out sharp, there's Game enough—I have so much business in my Head; I am so taken up with the Spirit of Politicks, that I have no time for Carnal Recreation.</P>

<P>Surely Father, you do not talk as you mean—Did the Holy Church ever command a Woman to commit Adultery?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hall.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Madam, nor did the Holy Church ever command a Woman to commit Murder—And yet you see that for the good of the Holy Church <HI>Judith</HI> cut off <HI>Holophernes</HI>'s Head—Nor is it with∣out great Probability from the Effect, that she let him have the use of her Body to boot—for you see that he had tired himself—that is, he had overwrought himself through the Allurements of a fresh Beauty and fell asleep—Thus you see, Madam, here was Whore∣dom, Murder and Treachery, three Fowl Sins, 'tis true—but being impos'd upon <HI>Judith</HI> by the Necessities of the Jewish Church, she was not only acquitted by the Church, but highly applauded for what she had done—</P>

<P>Madam, here is a Great Monarch, upon whom all the Hopes of the Holy Church in <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> depend—This Great Monarch Sues to you for the Trifle of a nights Lodging— Now upon your denial, this Great Monarch, not able to bear the Cross of his Ardent Affection, dies—and what follows?—All the Hopes of the Holy Church are thereby lost for ever—and you con∣demn'd to Eternal Purgatory—</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>—Father, Those of your Order are notable Sophisters— but you shall never argue me out of my Honour—I say again, the Holy Church never commanded a Woman to commit Adultery—</P>

<P>Lord Madam, that you will not understand—when I say the Holy Church, I mean the Interest of the Holy Church—For the In∣terest of the Holy Church and the Holy Church are all one—Now Madam, when the Interest of the Holy Church requires it, you are bound to do whatever may contribute to the Advancement of her interest—</P>

<SP>

<P>—Madam—I tell ye Madam, you stand in your own Light— and why is't?—because you are afraid to Cuckold your Husband— Now I affirm that you don't Cuckold your Husband—For Kings are not Men, but Gods—Now I say it can be no Defilement to a Mortal Husbands Bed, for his Wife to lye with a Deity—<HI>ergo</HI>— And thus <HI>Alcmena</HI> could not be said to Cuckold <HI>Amphitryo,</HI> because she did not lye with a Man, but with <HI>Jupiter,</HI> that was a God— <HI>ergo</HI> again—</P>

<P>No, no—my Lord, I know him too well—He'll ne're come to Compositions—He'll have all or none—He's too well acquainted with my Brother of <HI>France</HI> and I, to trust the strongest Engagements we can make him, unless we so secure him, that it would be the same thing as if we should surrender up all into his hands—</P>

<P>Why then we must trust to the Sword—They say Fortune assists the Daring—I am sure she never helps those that lye i' the Ditch and cry God Help 'em—Men that re∣solve to dye are easily Masters of other Mens Lives—Besides there is one thing more your Majesty does not think of—I have heard of <HI>Jacob Clements,</HI> and <HI>Ravilliac</HI>—'Tis true 'tis below Persons of Honour to make use of such means—but Necessity oft times constrains us to base Actions—</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2. <HI>Priest.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In truth Father <HI>Hall,</HI> we have been long enough Pray∣ing to Heaven without any considerable Success—I am afraid the Saints there are all turn'd Protestants—And therefore I would that we should now turn our Devotions downward, and send to <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog;</HI> there are they two, and General <HI>Belzebub</HI> would bring along an Host of Infernal <HI>Hussars</HI> able to conquer all the <HI>Cantons</HI> of <HI>Switzerland</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hall.</SPEAKER>
<P>How wickedly you talk Father—'tis the Interst of the Saints to favour our Cause—I'm sure there's no Religion i'the World that pays them that Respect which we do—All the <HI>Hereticks</HI> slight 'em, unless the School-boys for the Holy days sake—Nay some are such Clowns, as not to admit 'em the Title of Saint, but call 'em plain <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Matthew</HI>—</P>

<P>And is there any Religion in the World that pays more respect to <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog,</HI> and <HI>Belzebub</HI> as we do?—The <HI>Turk</HI> does not pay so much—Come Father, I am for driving that Nail that is most probable to go—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hall.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell ye Father, you talk wickedly—and I am afraid our wicked Lives fight against us more than any thing else—Come, Fathers, let us come to Confession a little among our selves—I must confess, my Father was a Cook, and dealt in Raw Flesh; but he told me 'twas never so good as when it was warm, if it were not over much Roasted—and I must confess I have lov'd, and do love, and so did my Mother before me, a piece of warm Flesh—And I confess, I have been conniving at, and assisting to help others to warm Flesh—And half a Score Drams of your Absolutions, Fathers, will expiate for what I have done—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1. <HI>Priest.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess I had once a very great Passion for a young Gentlewoman that was Marry'd, and she had as great an Affection for me; but not finding an Opportunity to couzen her Jealous Husband, I ordered her to counterfeit her self Sick, and to send for me to cure her with a Relick of a Saint that I had. Ac∣cordingly she did so, and fending for me, accordingly I went, and took one of my Brethren of the same Covent along with me, and while he was busie with the Maid, I employ'd my time with the Sick Mistress. But the Mischief was, that being like to have been surpriz'd by the Husband, for hast I left my Breeches be∣hind; and had it not been for a Fetch that the Devil put into her
<PB N="30" REF="18"/>Head (I shall love him the better for't as long as I live) we had both been discover'd. But she told her Husband my Breeches were the Relick of the Saint that had cur'd her, and that I had left 'em behind at her Request in case her Fits should return again, and so all was well. Was that any Sin, Father, to cure a Sick Lady? If it be, I must confess I have committed many a one of the same Nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hall.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look ye, Father, here we must consider the Intention of the Thing; for if the Intention were to cure the Lady, 'twas a good Intention—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1. <HI>Priest.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But she was not Sick, but only feign'd her self Sick—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hall.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was nothing to you—you had nothing to do to examine whether she counterfeited or no—you found her Sick and you cur'd her—and so you fulfill'd a good Intention—And therefore Father they must be louder Sins than these that cry to Heaven and do us Mischief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1. <HI>Priest.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess, I made Love to another marry'd Wo∣man—and she put the Dice upon—for she appointed the Night at her own House, and when the time came, most wickedly put an Old Woman of Threescore and Ten to bed to me—I must confess the Old Grandame lost nothing by it, for <HI>Jone</HI> was as good as my Lady i'the Dark—But that was not all—the next Morning she sent for all she knew of her own and my Acquaintance, and exposed me and my Female piece of wrinkled Antiquity, like <HI>Vulcan</HI> and <HI>Venus,</HI> to publick View; so that I was forc'd to forsake my Quarters, for fear of the rude <HI>Castigations</HI> of the Boys—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hall.</SPEAKER>
<P>This was a Sin, Father, for you suffer'd your self to be gull'd by a Woman—and such Sins as these, that is, the Discovery of such Sins as These undoes us—For it exposes the Warts and Wenns in our Sanctity as <HI>Cham</HI> uncover'd his Father's Naked∣ness—</P>

<SPEAKER>2. <HI>Priest.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Therefore Father, to avoid the Treacheries of Women, I learnt at <HI>Rome,</HI> a notable Wary Trick they have there to make use of the Male Sex—And I must confess I have had a great Passion for several pretty Youths—And I must farther con∣fess, that I have at this time a very pretty Urchin that lyes with me every night—He has such a Winning Way with him, such a Charming Behaviour, and Twattles so like a Nightingale, that I cannot but I must chuck him under the Chin now and then—</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2. <HI>Priest.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I question that, <HI>Father Hall,</HI>—I am apt to believe the Ancients were mistaken in the Signification of that word—I rather think the Inhabitants of <HI>Gomorrah</HI> made use of their Beasts, and that was their Crime—and therefore it was, that in Old times they ador'd their Deities in the shape of Beasts—I can∣not believe so many of our great Cardinals and Bishops, Fathers of our Church, would set us such bad Examples, if <HI>Sodomy</HI> were a Crime—</P>
</SP>

<P>I know indeed there was one of our Cardinals that wrote in defence of it—but I never heard of any that ever wrote in behalf of Adultery—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2. <HI>Priest.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis certain Father, that He who commits one Sin, sins less than he that commits two at a time—Now he that commits <HI>Adultery,</HI> runs himself into Prodigality and Expence upon his Beloved, and at the same time invades his Neighbours Pro∣perty—but a smooth Chinn'd Youth preserves a Man from the Guilt of both those Crimes—and who would go to a Crown Ordinary, when he may please his Appetite better for Six pence?—</P>

<P>If Men did not sometimes commit Errors, there would be no need of Repentance—That's the Remedy which we are order'd to make use of for the attoning of Heaven in cases of Necessity and Distress—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hall.</SPEAKER>
<P>Therefore Fathers, as we have been all great Sinners, I would have ye apply your selves to this Remedy—and make fair Weather with Heaven till the Storm be over—Our Affairs are now in a ticklish Condition—Then it will be time enough to break your Vows and Contracts with Heaven, when y'are at ease and in Prosperity—He that vow'd a Wax Candle to the Holy Virgin as big as the Main Mast, when he was in danger to be cast away, thought her not worth one of Twelve to the Pound, when he was got safe a Shore—</P>

<P>You wish well, Father—but let us be whose Servants we will—I do not find that either Heaven or Hell takes any care of us—and for my part, of all Repentances I don't like this <HI>Cat a Nine Tail Repentance</HI>—This nointing a Mans Back with Sacred Oyl of <HI>Whipcord</HI>—</P>

<P>Then give me leave to wish in my turn—that our Sowre Sauce may bring us Sweet Meat at length—When I Whip my self upon my own Accompt, I lay it on so gently, that if I should hit a Louse I should do it no hurt—but this Whipping upon a National Accompt, I d ead the thoughts of it—It makes my Back sore before I touch it—</P>

<P>'Tis a National Accompt indeed, Fathers—for if we loose this place, we loose all our Hopes in this World—and for the other, I am sure neither you nor I think of it—You loose the Fruits of all your Massacres and Rebellions—We loose the Fruits of all our Plots and Conspiracies—A <HI>Jesuit</HI> hitherto so Famous for his Politicks, will be lookt upon no better than a Jakes Farmer—His <HI>Holiness</HI> minds nothing but to keep the <HI>Most Christian King</HI> out of <HI>Italy</HI>—and the <HI>Most Christian King</HI> himself will have both his Hands too full to do us any good—Who would not Whip himself, as you may suppose <HI>Jehu</HI> Whipt his Horses, rather than this shall come to pass!—The way to Lash our Enemies is to Whip our selves—Lustily, Floggingly, Stoutly, Robustiously, Vigorously—</P>

<P>We have been up, my Lord all Night, at our Devotions, and something Heaven has inform'd us of, for publick good.</P>

<P>My Lord, we humbly conceive, here has been a very great neglect—for numbers of Men signifie little without a Blessing from above.</P>

<P>Have you brought those <HI>Blessings</HI> along with <HI>you,</HI> Fathers?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>1. <HI>Priest.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, my Lord—but we wonder they have not bin sent for all this while, from the <HI>Fountain</HI> where they are to be had upon Earth—We have heard of several Princes, that have been presented with Consecrated Swords, and Belts, and Hats of great value by St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Successor; by virtue of which they have wrought Miracles, and won mighty Victories, to the unspeakable Propagation of the <HI>Holy-Church;</HI> but we hear of none of these Con∣secrated Swords that have been sent to our Soveraign, or so much as desired in his behalf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2. <HI>Priest.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I should rather advise, that his Holiness might be sent to for a hundred thousand Consecrated <HI>Asses Jaw-Bones</HI>—for by that means might every one of our Souldiers prove a <HI>Sampson</HI>—Or else I would have his Holiness to send us St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Sword—(for if he has his Keys, there is no doubt, but he has his Sword too)—for then would I undertake, that if our Souldiers should but touch their Wea∣pons with that Sword, they would receive a particular Virtue from it, as a Million of <HI>Needles</HI> from the touch of one <HI>Load-stone;</HI> and then would every single Souldier kill a thousand Hereticks.</P>

<P>Alas! my Lord, we are Men of Frailty as well as others,

<P>And then again, Fathers, 'tis well known, that we <HI>Na∣tive Irish,</HI> have a strange <HI>Antipathy</HI> against Farting—but the <HI>En∣glish</HI> great Guns keep such a Bouncing and Roaring, as if all the Winds in the <HI>Compash</HI> were in their Breeshes, and they spit Fire, and shit Lead and Iron at such a rate, that we must confesh, they make a great fear upon us shometimes.</P>

<P>But you are Souldiers and Men of Honour—and such have always held it better to dye bravely in the Field, than to live in Slavery, without your Laws, your Estates and Religion.

<P>But I have been a leud Liver all my Life, I must con∣fesh, and you tell us so often of a <HI>Damnashion</HI> to come—that ma∣ny times it makes me rather shoose to live a little longer, than to be poshted out of this World I know not whither.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>4. <HI>Priest.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>As for that, Gentlemen, you shall have Pardons in your Pockets, under the Hands and Seals of his Holiness, for all the sins that ever you Committed, of what nature soever—so that all who are slain, shall go to Heaven forthwith, before a Cat can lick her Ear—Nay, there shall be a Note taken of their Names, and they shall all be Canoniz'd too—There they shall fit all the day long, and eat <HI>Ambrosia,</HI> and drink <HI>Nectar,</HI> which are as far beyond <HI>Bonny Clapper</HI> and <HI>Ʋsquebagh,</HI> as <HI>Ʋsquebagh</HI> and <HI>Bonni Clapper,</HI> are

<P>There is one way more, we have forgot, which is the Turkish way, to intoxicate their Souldiers with <HI>Opium,</HI> before they engage—for since the most Christian King makes use of the Turkish Force, we may as well make use of the Turkish Policy— Put <HI>Opium</HI> in their Snush, and they rush into Battel, and sight for a time, like Game-Cocks—so that the Enemy will never be able to withstand their Lubberly Multitude.</P>

<P>MY Lords, I make no question but you hear the News of the P. of <HI>Orange</HI>'s being Landed, and my Intelligence from <HI>England,</HI> confirms the number of his well provided Forces— He comes with all the Preparations of a Great, a Prudent, and a wary Captain—And now he's come, I know he will not trifle time away—In the mean time all's quiet in <HI>England</HI>— not a Mouse stins in my behalf, and that perplexes me— I wish I were well rid of this unwelcome Guest—but ugly fears possess me.—</P>

<P>However shew 'em not, Great Sir, that will dishearten all the rest.—</P>

<P>No, My Lord, not so neither; I'le have one brush for't, you may be sure, what e're comes on't—But you know, my Lord, we must be forc'd to leave <HI>Dublin</HI> but thinly mann'd behind us—and 'tis a fowl Nest of Hereticks—I wish they had bin all tran∣sported long ago.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tyr.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, Sir, that was debated in Council at the be∣ginning—But then it was found, that all the <HI>Butchers, Brew∣ers, Bakers, Clothiers, Weavers, Taylors, Shoo-makers, Hat-makers, Smiths, Carpenters,</HI> and other <HI>Artizans</HI> were Hereticks, so that had they bin remov'd, your Souldiers could have had neither Meat, Bread, nor Drink, nor Cloaths to wear, nor Carts to carry their Provision and Ammunition into the Field; nor would your Majesty have had a Mint and Workmen to Coyn your Brass and Copper.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nugent.</SPEAKER>
<P>However, Sir, there is Order taken to secure the Hereticks safe enough—Your own Example in <HI>England,</HI> in <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s time, has taught us to confine 'em all with in the Churches, Hospi∣tals and Jayls of the City, 'till the Business be well over; and then you may make Bonfires of 'em for your Victories.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>James.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, that care's over—But how stands the Army affected for fighting? are they in the same brave humour they were in, when I last took a view of 'em.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tyr.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think so, Sir, they show the same Symptoms of Valour
<PB N="40" REF="23"/>as ever, they Drink as hard, Swear as hard, toss about your Health as fast, Bounce, and Rant, and Swagger as loud as ever, and quarrel with one another as much as e're they did— and why they should not fight the Enemy as Boldly and Cou∣ragiously as they Duel one another, I know not—This I dare say, they will either fight or run away; but that's left to their Discretion—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>James.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but to come more close to the Business— you see the <HI>Newry</HI>'s lost, and you all agree that if we lose <HI>Ardee,</HI> the <HI>Boyne</HI> is the next Pass to be defended—so that it looks like stopping one Torrent by another.—</P>

<P>Greatly said again, <HI>Hamilton</HI>—But I have heard that Old Prince <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Nassau,</HI> had such a Trick of passing Rivers, that Duke <HI>d'Alva</HI> put the Question, whether his Army had wings or no—Now suppose our Enemies should have such a knack.</P>

<P>But what if they do—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ham.</SPEAKER>
<P>What if they do? Why then bread a Goad, Sir, I have a way to prevent that too, by driving stakes into the ground, all along this side of the River, for many Miles together, with their upper ends as sharp as Needles—so that when they come to light, they must of necessity spit themselves with their own weight— A General without Stratagems, is like a Mountebank without his Receipts.—</P>

<P>The next day, we were first attack'd by a great Body of the Enemy, under Count <HI>Schomberg,</HI> who having pass'd the River near to <HI>Slane,</HI> forc'd his way through eight hundred Dragoons that guarded the Ford, and being reinforc'd with fresh Succours, after a small resistance, routed all that opposed him, and drave them as far as <HI>Duleek.</HI></P>

<P>Gentlemen, I had a very good Army in <HI>England;</HI> but when I had the greatest Occasion for them, they deserted me—When I came into this Kingdom, I found my <HI>Roman Catholick</HI> Sub∣jects well equipped and prepared to defend my Cause. And tho' I had been often told, that when it came to the touch, they would never bear the brunt of a Battel, I would never believe it till now. 'Tis true, they did not desert me as in <HI>England,</HI> yet
<PB N="48" REF="27"/>when it came to a Tryal, they basely fled the Field, and left the Spoil to my Enemies—So that hence forward I never more desire to head an <HI>Irish</HI> Army, and now am resolv'd to shift for my self; and so must you too. So, Gentleman, Farewell—</P>

<P>A pretty rough draught of Cordial Allegiance—yet something better than Grief in one hand, and Sorrow in the other—Withal, my Lord Mayor—I must tell ye, that tho' it has been often debated, in Case a Revolution should happen, whether upon deserting of <HI>Dublin,</HI> the City should not be fir'd, the King has consider'd of it, and thinks it too Bar∣barous to be done—for tho' he affects the <HI>French</HI> Modes in all other things, in that he does not—</P>

<SPEAKER>Papist.</SPEAKER>
<P>OH Neighbour, well met—I am heartily glad to see you at liberty again—By my shoule, Neigh∣bour, you cannot imagine how sorry I was at your Confinement— By Creesh, Neighbour, I did all that lay in my Power for you—went and spoke in your behalf; till I was so snubb'd for my pains, that I was forc'd to pull in my Horns, for fear of being taken for one of you—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Protestant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Neighbour, I heard what pains you took—and I thank you for it most heartily—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Papist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly Neighbour 'twas always my Opinion, that our Clergy were somewhat too severe—I wish they had been more mild, it might perhaps have been better for 'em—I told 'em of their Rigour many times—but then they were presently Cock a Hoop—What are you a favourer of <HI>Hereticks?</HI>—and then my Mouth was presently stopt—</P>

<P>O Neighbour, How I am overjoy'd at your delive∣rance—I protest, Neighbour, I offer'd to be your Bail, and carryed another along with me, but it would not be taken—I think the Devil was in 'em to be so Cruel—I knew ye to be an Honest Man, and a just Dealer—and I would have paun'd all the Reputation I had in the World for ye, if they would have taken it—</P>

<P>Neighbour! I protest I joy to see you out of your Trouble—did you never receive some inconsiderable trifling parcels of Money by a private hand—I know they were not worth speaking of—but I'le assure you, upon the Word of a Christian, 'twas I that sent 'em—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Protestant.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'le assure you, Neighbour, they were very acceptable—and

<P>I was not ignorant of your kindness, Neighbour—I knew the Meat by the dressing, and the Drink by the taste— for I knew you had your meat always well drest, and kept good Drink in your House—I hope I may live to retaliate your Cour∣tesies.—</P>

<P>It may be so, Sir,—but were not you for two years to∣gether most violently tormented with the Head-ach—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Protestant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, I was so, but when King <HI>James</HI> was here, coming over <HI>Essex Bridge</HI> late i'th' Night, from visiting some Pro∣testant Relations, some body or other, without the least provoca∣tion in the World, gave me a cut o' the Head about seven Inches long, to my great ease as it prov'd, for the Pain has never troubl'd me since the Cure—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Papist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'le assure ye, Sir, upon the word of a Christian, 'twas I gave you that Cut—for by my skill in Surgery, I knew there was no other way to Cure ye—And I did it unexpectedly, for fear you would have been unwilling to have undergone the Cure, had you been told of it beforehand—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Protestant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly Sir, 'twas a very great kindness, more than I de∣ferv'd—and a very great Cure; and I'le assure ye, Sir, I shall recommend ye for a Curer of the Head-ach, to all I know that are in the same Condition that I then was—</P>

<P>Truly Neighbour, I have not heard a Mouse stir in my House yet—I believe they all went after our Provisions to the Popish Habitations—and then for my Wares and Goods they are all vanished—and yet I am sure when I left 'em,
<PB N="51" REF="28"/>they were all Corporeal Substances, that had they not been taken away, would never have mov'd of themselves—Certainly Car∣riage was very dear, during our Confinement—and I am apt to think they would have carry'd a way the very bare walls too, had they had time to pick down the Mortar.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>6. <HI>Protestant.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That it was debated whether they should fire the City or no, in case they were forc'd to desert it, is apparent by by the King's own confession—and it was no less plain, that those thoughts were laid aside, more out of fear of the little Mer∣cy to be expected from an Enemy so enrag'd—than out of any Kindness to us—and therefore now we are free, let us have a care of the same Yoke again—I hope we shall fight a little bet∣ter for our Deliverer—than these Caterpillers did for their King—and so if you please, let us go and Drink the best Health in the World, To King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Berwick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou seem'st to have rather flown, than come by Sea—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mess.</SPEAKER>
<P>With the same speed your Royal Father flew, who was at <HI>Tredah</HI> the Tenth of <HI>July,</HI> and the Twenty sixth at St. <HI>Ger∣mains</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Berwick.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is my Royal Father well?—</P>

<PB N="55" REF="30"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mess.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon the twenty sixth of <HI>July,</HI> your Royal Father arri∣ved at St. <HI>Germains,</HI> in the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Coaches, accompa∣nyed by the D. of <HI>Boüillon</HI>—Great Chamberlain; who was sent to receive him in his Majesty's Name—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ber.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's Honour still, and Royal Respect I see, shewn even to my Father's Misfortunes—what would be done to his Prosperity!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mess.</SPEAKER>
<P>The King went to visit him the same day, and re∣ceiv'd him with all the Testimonies of a Tender and Ardent Affection—And made him new Protestations to support him a∣gainst his Enemy, and to employ all his Forces to restore him; nor did he shew him any signs of being dissatisfied with his Con∣duct—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ber.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's new Consolation for ye, my Lords, to raise your sinking Spirits—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lauzune.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish they may come quickly, or else I fear I shall be in the Sudds, before their Arrival—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>[fetching a deep sigh</HI>—</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ber.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why d'ye sigh, my Lord?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lauzune.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[Sighing again.]</STAGE>
<P>I know my Master's a great Dissembler, my Lord, and I am well satisfied moreover, that he has other Fish to fry, than to employ all his Forces to assist your Royal Father—<HI>Morbleu,</HI> I don't like the beginning of the Story—Go on Messenger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mess.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Visit lasted above two Hours, and by the report of some that understand Affairs, 'twas not altogether spent in Complements—'Tis said also, that your Royal Father is to go aboard the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, and endeavour to land in <HI>England,</HI> where he hopes to find a Considerable Party that will declare for him—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ber.</SPEAKER>
<P>I like this well—'Twas so order'd, to save my Father's Vow, who has determined never to head an <HI>Irish</HI> Army more—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mess.</SPEAKER>
<P>The next Morning he went to <HI>Versailles,</HI> to visit her Majesty, and return'd that Evening to the Queen his Royal Con∣sort—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ber.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how did she receive him?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mess.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>[After a little studying]</STAGE>
<P>Um—why—an't like your Grace, there were some little Bickerings between 'em at first—but the next Morning she seem'd well contented.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ber.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay—she's a Woman never bears Malice long in her Mind—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mess.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's something more that I have to say, but I'm loth to out with it —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ber.</SPEAKER>
<P>Out with it man—for fear of Choaking —</P>
</SP>

<P>'Tis said—<HI>there stops</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ber.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee go on —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mess.</SPEAKER>
<P>—'Tis said, that all the Welcomes and Caresses which the King made your father, cannot reconcile him to the Esteem of the Court Grandees—They say that <HI>William</HI> was truly born to Command, and <HI>James</HI> to obey—and that it was for your Father who had nothing more to lose, to have acted the Per∣son of King <HI>William</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and for <HI>William</HI> the third to have spar'd himself, as your Royal Father did —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ber.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did they call him King <HI>William?</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mess.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, an't like your Grace—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ber.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'le go and Challenge 'em every Mother's Son, as soon as I'me at leisure—Well, but how does my Royal Father look, does he seem any way dejected?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mess.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite the contrary, Sir—He carries it with an Air and Countenance rather of a Prince Triumphant over his Enemies, than of a Person that had fled before 'em—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ber.</SPEAKER>
<P>Law ye now there, my Lords—You see my Royal Father's Heart whole still—and the King of <HI>France</HI> sticks to him— I find we shall have t'other Brush for't still—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lauzune.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this does not yet satisfie me—I'm sure my Ma∣ster's too knowing in the Art of War, not to understand, that if his Arms have not prosper'd in <HI>Ireland,</HI> it must be in part the fault of him that commanded them—So that if he re∣ceived him kindly at his return, and appear'd satisfied with his Couduct, it was rather out of Policy, than from the bottom of his Heart—But my Master has still need of him, to oppose the King of <HI>England,</HI> and therefore it is, that he is so good a Husband of him, and so behaves himself towards him as if he were the greatest General in the World—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sarsfield.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are so full of Scruples, my Lord—you suppose and believe, and believe and suppose this and that and t'o∣ther— I believe and suppose no such thing—I believe the King of <HI>France</HI> to be real, and that he seriously intends to do as he says—</P>
</SP>
<PB N="57" REF="31"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tyr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Otherwise he were the most ungrateful Person in the World—for when it lay in our Master's Power he did all that he could for him—Nay, I may boldly say, that had it not been for our Master, he had never come to what he is—I will instance yee only in one thing, and that was in mannaging all the Dutch Wars for your Master's ad∣vantage—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gad I believe the most Christian King to be one of the Honestest Gentlemen in <HI>Europe</HI>—and my rea∣son is, because he always lov'd a handsom Girl—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ber.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look yee, my Lords, you must grant me that Kings Heads are better than other Mens Heads—And if so, then two Kings Heads are better than one—so that I am confident, after these two Kings have laid their Heads toge∣ther a little while, you'll see strange Alterations in <HI>Eu∣rope</HI>—</P>

<L>I <HI>Wonder what our Audience will say,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Of this our Thundring, drumming, fighting Play?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Here are no Scenes indeed, as will invite,</HI></L>
<L><HI>We bring 'em or, but yet they will not fight.</HI></L>
<L><HI>These</HI> Irish <HI>are of just the self same Kidney,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Like the two Cowards in Sir</HI> Philip Sidny.</L>
<L><HI>They Huff, present, Rage, foam, look big and Swear,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But something whispers to 'em,</HI> have a Care.</L>
<L><HI>Such Sparks the Ladies Hatred cannot lack,</HI></L>
<L><HI>They hate the Man, that always turns his Back:</HI></L>
<L><HI>No, they by other methods must be won,</HI></L>
<L><HI>They like the Man that briskly pushes on.</HI></L>
<L><HI>'Tis strange what Nature made these Irish for,</HI></L>
<L><HI>They're neither good in Peace, nor fit for War;</HI></L>
<L><HI>The highest Office they are fit for most,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Is to be Trotters in the Penny Post.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Oh! were they all upon a Famous Plain,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Where never yet was daring Monarch slain,</HI></L>
