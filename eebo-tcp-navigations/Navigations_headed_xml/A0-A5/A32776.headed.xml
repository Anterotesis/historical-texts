<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the Description of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Author
<HI>Camden</HI> hath been at great Pains, and
taken Information from the most Intel∣ligent,
in the <HI>Antiquities, Peerage</HI> and
Constitutions of the Kingdom; and especi∣ally
from Sir <HI>Alexander Hay</HI> Secretary of
State, who in the year 1608, did succeed in that Office to
the Lord <HI>Balmerinoch;</HI> till which time, he hath given
the most full and exact account of our Nobility, or Lords of
Parliament, in the Order and Description of the Countries
or Shires, the Places from which they take their Designations,
and where they have their Interest or Residence; and there∣fore
his Work deserves very well a Second Edition, for the
benefit of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland;</HI> which if it had been
finished in due Time, as it was begun to be Printed, might
have been a part of the Second Edition of the whole <HI>Bri∣tannia,</HI>
and will always be a Treatise by it self concerning
<HI>Scotland,</HI> to satisfy these whose Curiosity lead them no fur∣ther.</P>
<P>In this Edition, little Alteration is made from the
Words of the Author, albeit now less used, except where
the Error or Mistake can be mended by a few Words, and
might have proceeded, rather from the Fault of the Tran∣scriber
or Printer, then the Author; and I have left out
the <HI>Latine Lines</HI> made by <HI>Johnston,</HI> the Poet on several
Occasions, and also the Translation of them in <HI>English
<PB REF="3"/>
Rhime,</HI> as Tending more to increase the Volumn, then to
give Light to the History; and have made Alteration of
these words which directly relate to the former Treatise, as
a part of it, and so have omitted the Authors Preface and
Apology, for his <HI>little experience in</HI> Scottish Affairs, <HI>which
he lightly passeth over, reserving the due Honour to these
of that Nation, with a more full Pinsel to set forth these
Matters.</HI> Albeit in several things of more remote and an∣cient
Times he is mistaken; yet still the Treatise is useful,
and deserving well to be published: nor is he or his Infor∣mers
lyable to Censure on that account, most of these being
Vulgar Errors, passing in that Time, and since, for truth:
and a second Edition was more proper, passing over
them, then in this to have Commented upon, and con∣tradicted
the Author, which is but seldom and
slenderly done, in Matters only concerning the Kingdom
in General, and the Great <HI>Stewarts</HI> of <HI>SCOTLAND,</HI>
the Progenitors of our Kings.</P>
<P>It will be a Task, requiring great time, skill and pains,
and the help of more knowing persons, by particular Trea∣tises,
going in order from the greater Antiquity downward,
out of the most antient and approved Histories, most ex∣act
Collections and authentick Records and Documents, to
describe the considerable and eminent Families, who
have by their Actions deserved to be Noticed, without which
the Account of the Nation in general, and of the other great
Families will be incompleat; albeit some of them did ne∣ver
attain to the Degree of Peerage: seing in the Sense and
Language of our <HI>Law,</HI> as well as of the <HI>French,</HI> the Nobi∣lity
is composed of the <HI>Barons, Free-holders,</HI> and immedi∣at
<HI>Tennents</HI> of the King, and not of the <HI>Peers</HI> only, now
called <HI>Lords of Parliament.</HI> In which undertaking, the
Errors in this Treatise, to the Advantage of some, and
<PB REF="3" MS="y"/>
Prejudice of other Families, may be rectified; and in the
mean time, the <HI>Publisher</HI> of this Edition is not to be con∣cluded
of the Opinion, that all the Matters contained
therein, are to be received as Truth, and is not to
Incurr the displeasure of any, by the further publishing of
these smaller Errors.</P>
<P>If in the <HI>Supplement and Addition,</HI> the <HI>Publisher</HI> hath er∣red
in anything, upon better Information, &amp; full Convicti∣on,
he is most willing to amend, and shall study to find an Op∣portunity
to publish the same: and if in the Descriptiou of some
Families, he hath been more Large then in others, it is not to
be imputed to Partiality, but that his Knowledge and Infor∣mation
was not alike full in all. As to these more ancient.
<HI>Lords,</HI> who are described by the Author, the <HI>Publisher</HI> hath gi∣ven
no more particular account of the times of their Creati∣on▪
then the Author did, reserving that to another Time and
Occasion; but hath been more special in the Accounts of the
Later <HI>Lords,</HI> and in the method of the Author hath men∣tioned
them, according to the Order of the Situation of the
several Places from which they have their Designations:
Some Errors are mended in the Description of Places, but
in that, exactness is not studied, there being particular
Maps and Descriptions of the Countries by <HI>Straloch</HI> and
<HI>Scotstarbat,</HI> Printed <HI>anno</HI> 1654, and lately by Mr.
<HI>Adair,</HI> some more exact Tables are published, and the rest
dayly expected.</P>
<P>It is Observable, That a great part of the Nobility, since
the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> the Sixth, have made and en∣creased
their Estates, by being Members of the <HI>Colledge
of Justice,</HI> or <HI>Session,</HI> and obtaining the Erection of Church
Benefices, (whereof they were Commendators) in Tem∣poral
Lordships, to them and their Successors: the finer
Spirits, who formerly were imployed in the Wars, or be∣came
<PB REF="4"/>
Churchmen, since the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> the
Fifth, beginning to apply themselves to the <HI>Laws,</HI> some
of them did attain to the Degrees of <HI>Lords</HI> of <HI>Session,</HI> and
other publick Imployments; and for their better Encou∣ragement,
were rewarded with Abbacies in <HI>Commen∣dam,</HI>
and were Created <HI>Peers,</HI> or <HI>Temporal Lords</HI> of
<HI>Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>It is likewise worth Observing, That King <HI>James</HI> the
Sixth (after his Succession to the Crown of <HI>England)</HI> did
make a considerable Addition to the antient Nobility of this
Nation, by new Creations, as well as in his other Domi∣nions;
for in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> as well as here, the
<HI>Peers</HI> were much diminished by Forfaultures, extinction of
Dignities, and by the suppression of the Abbots, and Priors,
which Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> had not supplyed.</P>
<P>Since the <HI>Reformation</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> the Constitution of
our Parliament did receive a considerable Alteration, the
Clergie, the <HI>third Estate,</HI> for some time, being almost A∣bolished;
and these in the <HI>Sederunts of the Parliaments,</HI>
and <HI>Articles pro Clero,</HI> not being Church-men, but meer
Laicks, Titulars and Commendators of Abbacies and Pri∣ories;
and of them seldom a full and equal Number with
the other Estates in the <HI>Articles,</HI> and for the most part but
two or three of them designed <HI>Bishops,</HI> who had not the full
Power and <HI>Episcopal Jurisdiction,</HI> which was for a long time
lodged in the <HI>Synods</HI> and <HI>General Assemblies,</HI> and the only
Popish-Bishop, who imbraced the Reformation, and continued
in Office in the <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State,</HI> was <HI>Adam Bothwel,</HI> Bishop
of <HI>Orkney.</HI> There was also a great Alteration in the Repre∣sentation
of Barons and Free-holders in Parliament, who al∣beit
fred by <HI>Act of Parliament</HI> King <HI>James</HI> the First,
from general appearances in <HI>Parliament</HI> to which they were
formerly lyable, and allowed to send their Commissioners to
<PB REF="4"/>
represent them; yet if this Act was ever observed, it was long
in desuetude, till revived in the <HI>Parliament 1587;</HI> Since
which time the <HI>Free-holders</HI> of the Shires, under the De∣grees
of Peers, have sent their Commissioners to represent
themselves and their Vassals in <HI>Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>To supply these Alterations, it was necessar that more
should be Created <HI>Lords of Parliament,</HI> to come in proper
Right, and as representing these holding their Lands of
them, as the <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Abbots</HI> did for themselves and
their Vassals, in right of their <HI>Baronies,</HI> which they held
immediatly <HI>of the Crown;</HI> and <HI>Bishops</HI> being again sup∣prest,
as well as <HI>Abbots</HI> and <HI>Priors,</HI> whose Lands are pos∣sest
by the <HI>Peers</HI> or <HI>Free-holders,</HI> or their Vassals, the great
number of <HI>Peers</HI> is still more reasonable, whereof the half
do never appear in <HI>Parliament,</HI> by reason of <HI>Minority,</HI> or as
being <HI>Females,</HI> or being otherways Legally incapacitat or hin∣dered
to take place there; and also, the Addition of Twenty six
Members, by a late <HI>Act of Parliament</HI> to the representation
of the <HI>Barons,</HI> did make a just Ballance, the Free-holders re∣presenting
a great part of the <HI>Property of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be remembred, that of those Dignities noted as
Extinct, some of them do stand in the Rolls of Parlia∣ment,
their Honours being lately enjoyed, and the Rolls not
altered, but by special Warrand.</P>
<P>To the Treatise, is subjoyned a List of the <HI>Nobility</HI> with
their <HI>Sirnames,</HI> and the <HI>Titles</HI> of such of their eldest Sons who
are Lords, and of the other Members of this <HI>Current Parli∣ment,</HI>
Commissioners for <HI>Shires</HI> and <HI>Burghs Royal;</HI> and
a second Alphabetical Table of these whom the <HI>Publisher</HI> ob∣served
to have been created, or to have used at anytime, the
Titles or Dignities of <HI>Lords, Viscounts, Earls, Marquesses</HI>
and <HI>Dukes;</HI> and a Table of the <HI>Abbacies</HI> &amp; <HI>Priories,</HI> especial∣ly
these who were <HI>Conventual,</HI> once a part constituent of our
<PB REF="5"/>
<HI>Parliament;</HI> with a List of the <HI>Presbytries, Synods</HI> and
<HI>Commissariots</HI> not specified in the Treatise.</P>
<P>These are the few Things with which the <HI>Publisher</HI> thought
fit to advertise the Reader, <HI>Farewel.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Division of SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He North part of the Island of
<HI>Britain,</HI> was of old time inha∣bited
throughout by the <HI>Picts,</HI>
who were divided into two
Nations, the <HI>Dicalidonii,</HI> and
<HI>Vecturiones:</HI> of whom the Author did speak
out of <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus.</HI> But when the
<HI>Scots</HI> became Lords and Rulers over all this
part, it was shared into seven parts among se∣ven
Princes, as we find in a little ancient Pam∣phlet
touching the division of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in
these words and old Name.</P>
<P>The first part contained <HI>Enegus</HI> and <HI>Maern.</HI></P>
<P>The second, <HI>Atheodl</HI> and <HI>Goverin.</HI></P>
<P>The third, <HI>Stradeern</HI> and <HI>Meneted.</HI></P>
<P>The fourth, was <HI>Forthever.</HI></P>
<P>The fifth, <HI>Mar</HI> with <HI>Buchan.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="6"/>
The sixth, <HI>Muref</HI> and <HI>Ros.</HI></P>
<P>The seventh <HI>Cathanes,</HI> which <HI>Mound,</HI> a Moun∣tain
in the midst divideth, running on for∣ward
from the West Sea to the East.</P>
<P>Then afterwards the same Author reporteth,
according to the Relation of <HI>Andrew</HI> Bishop
of <HI>Cathanes,</HI> that the whole Kingdom was
divided likewise into seven Territories.</P>
<P>The first from <HI>Erith,</HI> in the <HI>British</HI> tongue cal∣led
by the <HI>Romans Worid,</HI> now <HI>Scotwade,</HI>
to the River <HI>Tae.</HI></P>
<P>The second to <HI>Hilef,</HI> according as the Sea fetch∣eth
a compass, to a Mountain in the North∣east
part of <HI>Sirivelin,</HI> named <HI>Athran.</HI></P>
<P>The third from <HI>Hilef</HI> to <HI>Dee.</HI></P>
<P>The fourth from <HI>Dee</HI> to the River <HI>Spe.</HI></P>
<P>The fifth from <HI>Spe</HI> to the Mountain <HI>Brunal∣ban.</HI></P>
<P>The sixth <HI>Mures</HI> and <HI>Ros.</HI></P>
<P>The seventh, the Kingdom <HI>Argathel,</HI> as it were
the border and skirt of the <HI>Scots:</HI> who were
so called of <HI>Gathelgas</HI> their Captain.</P>
<P>Also according to the Habitation of the Peo∣ple,
<HI>Scotland</HI> is now divided into <HI>Highland-men</HI>
and <HI>Lawland-men:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Highlandmen. Lawlandmen.</NOTE> These being more
civil, use the <HI>English</HI> Language and Apparel;
the other, which are rude and unruly, speak
<HI>Irish,</HI> and go apparelled <HI>Irish</HI>-like. Out of this
division the <HI>Borderers</HI> are excluded, because
by reason of Peace shining now upon them on
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
every side, by a blessed and happy Union, they
are to be ranged &amp; reckoned in the very heart
and midst of the <HI>British</HI> Empire, as who begin
to be weary of Wars, and to acquaint them∣selves
with the delightful benefits of Peace.</P>
<P>Moreover, according to the Situation and
Position of the places, the whole Kingdom is
divided into two parts: the South on this side
the River <HI>Tay,</HI> and the North beyond <HI>Tay;</HI>
besides a number of Islands lying round about.
In the South part, these Countries are more
remarkable than the rest.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The States or Degrees of SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<P>THe Republick, or Common-wealth of
the <HI>Scots,</HI> like as that of <HI>Englishmen,</HI>
consisteth of a King, the Nobility or
Gentry, and Commons.</P>
<P>The King, to use the words of the Re∣cord,
is <HI>Directus totius Dominus,</HI> that is, <HI>The
direct Lord of the whole Domain,</HI> or <HI>Dominion,</HI>
and hath Royal Authority and Jurisdiction
over all the States and Degrees, as well Eccle∣siastical
as Lay or Temporal.</P>
<P>Next unto the King is his eldest Son, who
is called <HI>Prince of Scotland,</HI> and by a pecu∣liar
Right Duke of <HI>Rothsay,</HI> and Seneschal or
Steward of <HI>Scotland.</HI> But all the rest of the
Kings Children are named simply <HI>Princes.</HI></P>
<P>Among the Nobles, the greatest and most
honourable were in old time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thanes,</NOTE> <HI>The Thanes,</HI>
that is, those who were enobled only by the
Office which they administred. For the word
in the ancient English Saxon Tongue signifi∣eth,
<HI>The Kings Minister.</HI> Of these, they of
the superior place were called <HI>Abthanes,</HI> the
inferior <HI>Vnder Thanes.</HI> But these Names by
little and little grew out of use, ever since that
King <HI>Malcolm</HI> the third conferred the Titles
of Earls and Barons, after the manner receiv∣ed
from the English, upon Noblemen of good
good de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>. In process of time, new Titles
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
of Honours were much taken up, and
<HI>Scotland</HI> as well as <HI>England,</HI> hath had Dukes,
Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts, and Barons. As
for the Title of Duke, the first that brought
it into <HI>Scotland</HI> was King <HI>Robert</HI> the third, a∣bout
the year of Salvation 1400. Likeas the
honourable Titles of Marquess and Viscount
were first brought in by King <HI>JAMES</HI>
the sixth. These are counted Nobles of the
higher degree, and have both place and voice
in the Parliament, and by a special Name are
called <HI>Lords,</HI> likeas also the <HI>Bishops.</HI></P>
<P>Among the Nobles of a lower degree, in
the first place are ranked <HI>Knights,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Knights,</NOTE> who verily
are dubbed with greater solemnity than in any
other place throughout all <HI>Europe,</HI> by taking
of an Oath, and are proclaimed by the pub∣lick
voice of an Herauld. In the year 1621
was instituted the Hereditary Order of Knight
Baronet, for advancing the Plantation of <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI>

<P>THe supreme Court, as well for Dig∣nity
as Authority, is accounted the
Assembly of the States of the King∣dom,
which is called by the very
same Name as it is in <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliament.</NOTE> <HI>A Parliament:</HI>
and hath the same very power as absolute. It
consisteth of three States, of Lords <HI>Spiritual,</HI>
namely, Bishops, Abbots, and Priors: and
of Lords <HI>Temporal,</HI> to wit, Dukes, Marques∣ses,
Earls, Viscounts, and Barons: and Com∣missioners
for Cities and Burghs. Unto whom
were adjoyned not long since for every Coun∣ty
or Shire also two Commissioners. And
by the 11th Act of the second Session of this
current Parliament, certain Shires, and the
Stewartrie of <HI>Kirkcudbright</HI> therein enumerat,
according to the largeness and extent of the
Lands, are allowed an additional Represen∣tation
of Commissioners in Parliament, where∣by
the greater Shires are allowed four, some
Shires three, and in the Stewartrie of <HI>Kirk∣cudbright</HI>
two Commissioners. As will appear
clearly by the List of Parliament subjoyned.
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
It is appointed and solemnly called by the
King at his pleasure, at a certain set time, be∣fore
it be holden. When these States above∣said
are assembled, and the causes of their as∣sembly
delivered by the King, his Commissi∣oner,
or Chancellor, the Lords <HI>Spiritual</HI> chuse
out apart by themselves, eight of the Lords
<HI>Temporal;</HI> as also, the Lords <HI>Temporal</HI> make
choise of as many out of the Lords <HI>Spiritual:</HI>
then the same all joyntly together nominat
eight, of the Commissioners for the Counties,
and as many of the Commissioners for the free
Burghs regal, which make up in all the number
of thirty two. And then <HI>these</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Domini pro articulis.</NOTE> <HI>Lords of
the Articles</HI> (so they are termed) together with
the Chancellor, Treasurer, Keeper of the Pri∣vy
Seal, Kings Secretary, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> do admit or
reject every Bill proposed unto the States, after
they have been first imparted unto the King,
or his Commissioner. Being allowed by the
whole Assembly of the States, they are through∣ly
weighed &amp; examined, &amp; such of them as pass
by the greater number of Voices, are exhibited
unto the King, or his Commissioner, who by
touching them with the Scepter, pronounceth,
that he either ratifieth &amp; approveth them, or
disableth and maketh the same void· But if any
thing dislike the King, it is razed out before.</P>
<P>This Method of the Lords of Articles is al∣tered
by the <HI>3d.</HI> Act of the first Session of this

of Parliament is abrogated, and the Parlia∣ment

Committees, and that in the Committes,
some of the Officers of State may be present
by their Majesties or their Commissioners ap∣pointment,
who is freely to propose and de∣bate
allennerly, but not to Vote. By Act of Par∣liament
1617, the Officers of State are re∣stricted
to the number of Eight, including
the Master of Requests, beside the Chancel∣lor,
who by his Office is President of the Par∣liament.
Since the Restauration of King <HI>Ch.

but frequently two Secretaries; and there
hath been also Debate amongst the lesser Offi∣cers
of State: and especially between the
Thesaurer-Depute and the others, concerning

<P>The President of the Session by an Act of
Parliament 1661. is declared to have Prece∣dency
of the Lord Register and Advocat,
and they to have Precedency of the Lord
Thesaurer-Deput.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mckenzies Precedency. <HI>page.</HI> 37.</NOTE> * Sir <HI>George Mckenzie</HI> in
his Precedency, doth relate, <HI>That there
was an Ordinance upon the</HI> 20. Feb. 1623
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
<HI>amongst his Majesties Officers and Counsellors,
where the lesser Officers of State are ranked, and
after them the Lords of Session, according to their
Admission, and before Privy Counsellors being
Barons &amp; Gentlemen.</HI> Suitable to this prece∣dency,
the Lords of Session have since their
Institution enjoyed the Title of <HI>Lord,</HI> both
in Designation and Compellation, albeit the
Designation be proper to the Lords of Parlia∣ment:
The Lords of Session in the beginning
being composed of <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Abbots,</HI> and dig∣nified
beneficed Persons, Chief Barons, and
eminent Lawers; This Designation is fre∣quently
given to them in the Acts of Parlia∣ment,
and particularly to President <HI>Provan,</HI>
in an unprinted Act, <HI>anno</HI> 1581. intituled <HI>Act
in favours of</HI> Mr. <HI>William Baillie</HI> Lord <HI>Provan,</HI>
&amp; frequently thereafter. All the space between
Sessions, being the times of Sowing and Har∣vest,
is Vacation and Intermission of all Suites
and Law matters. They give Judgment accor∣ding
to the Parliament, Statutes, and Munici∣pal
Laws, and where they are defective, they
have recourse to the Imperial Civil Law.</P>
<P>There are besides in every County or Shire, in
ferior civil Judicatories or Courts kept, where∣in
the Sheriff of the Shire, or his Depute, decid∣eth
the Controversies of the Inhabitants, about
violent Ejections, Instrusions, Damages, Debts,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> From which Courts or Judges, in re∣gard
of hard and unequal dealing, or else of
Alliance and Partiality, they appeal some∣time
to the Session. These Sheriffs are all for
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
the most part Hereditary, for the Kings of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
like as these of <HI>England</HI> also, to oblige
more surely unto them the better sort of
Gentlemen by their Benefits and Favours,
made in old time, these Sheriffs hereditary and
and perpetual. But the English Kings soon
perceiving the inconveniencies thereby ensu∣ing,
of purpose changed this Order, &amp; appoint∣ed
them from year to year. There be Civil
Courts also in every Regalitie, holden by their
Baillies, to whom the Kings have graciously
granted Royalities: as also in Free-Burghs,
by the Magistrates thereof.</P>
<P>There are likewise Judicatories, which they
call <HI>Commissariats,</HI> the highest whereof is k<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pt
at <HI>Edinburgh:</HI> In which before four Judges, or
Commissars; Actions are pleaded concerning
Wills &amp; Testaments, the Right of Ecclesiastical
Benefices, Tithes, Divorces, and such other
Ecclesiastical Causes. In every other several
part almost throughout the Kingdom, there
sitteth but one Judge alone in a place about
these matters.</P>
<P>In criminal Causes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Courts of Cri∣minal Matters.</NOTE> the Kings Chief Justice
holdeth his Court for the most part at <HI>Edin∣burgh,</HI>
(which Office the Earls of <HI>Argile</HI> exe∣cuted
for some time,) and he doth deput
two or three Lawers, who have the hearing
and deciding of Capital Actions concerning
Life and Death, or of such as infer loss of
Limbs, or of all Goods. And by the 16 <HI>Act
3d. Sess 2d. Parl. K. Cha. 2d. concerning
the Justice Court,</HI> it doth now consist of the
<PB N="15" REF="12"/>
Lord Justice-General, the Lord Justice-Clerk,
who are both at the Kings Nomination, and
to them are added five of the Lords of Session,
who are supplied from time to time by the
King, and are called Lords of the Justiciary.
In this Court the Defendant is permitted, yea
in case of High-Treason, to entertain a
Counsellor or Advocat to plead his Cause.</P>
<P>Moreover in Criminal Matters, there are
sometimes by vertue of the Kings Commission
and Authority, Justices appointed for the de∣ciding
of this or that particular Cause.</P>
<P>Also the Sheriffs in their Territories, and
Magistrats in some Burghs, may sit in Judge∣ment
of Man-slaughter (in case the Man-slay∣er
be taken within 24 hours after the Deed
committed) and being found guilty by a Ju∣rie,
put him to death. But if that time be
once over-past, the Cause is referred and put
over to the <HI>Kings Justice,</HI> or his Deputs. The
same priviledge also some of the Nobility and
Gentry enjoy against Theives taken within
their own Jurisdictions. There be likewise
that have such Royalities, as that in Criminal
Causes they may exercise a Jurisdiction with∣in
their own Limits, and in some Cases recal
those that dwell within their own Limits and
Liberties from the Kings Justice, howbeit
with a Caution and Proviso interposed, <HI>That
they judge according to Law.</HI></P>
<P>Thus much briefly the Author hath put
down, as one that had but slightly looked in∣to
these matters, yet by the information of the
<PB N="16" REF="13" MS="y"/>
judicious Knight, Sir <HI>Alexander Hay,</HI> Secre∣tary
to <HI>K. Ja.</HI> 6. for <HI>Scotland,</HI> who had given
the Author good light. He being one of the
three principal Clerks of Session, was in the
year 1608 appointed Secretary in place of the
Lord <HI>Balmerinoch</HI> removed, and admtted a
Lord of Session the <HI>3d,</HI> of <HI>Feb.</HI> 1610. But
as touching SCOTLAND, <HI>what a Noble
Countrey it is, and what Men it breedeth</HI> (as
sometimes the Geographer wrote of Britain)
<HI>there will within a while more certain and more
evident matter be delivered, since that most
high and mighty Prince</HI> K. Ja. 6. <HI>did set it o∣pen
for us, which had so long time been shut from
us.</HI> Mean time before we proceed to the De∣scription
of particular Places, according to
the Authors project, we must give some short
Account of the Privy Council, Thesaury
and Exchequer, being Soveraign Courts, and
omitted by the Author. The Privy Council is
constitute by the King's Commission to decide
in matters that concerns the Government and
publick Peace of the Nation, wherein the
Chancellor by his Office doth preside, and af∣ter
him the President of the Council, who
hath the same precedency as in <HI>England:</HI> The
Persons are chiefly named out of the Nobility,
with the addition of some Barons. In the
Thesaury and Exchequer, the Lord high The∣saurer
doth preceed, but this Office is frequent∣ly
in Commission, as it is at present, and then
the Lord Chancellor is, and uses to be one and
Chief of the Commission, as also the Lord
<PB N="17" REF="13"/>
Thesaurer Deput, and they together with
the Lords of Exchequer nominat by Their
Majesties do Order, Determine, and dispose
of the Kings Rents, Revenues, Gifts, and
Casualities: I have omitted particular Lists
of them, in regard the Commissions to the
Council, Thesaury and Exchequer are some
times changed, as the King doth think fit; and
that the persons employed in them are emi∣nent,
of whom occasion will be to make men∣tion
in some part of this Treatise, either as
Noblemen, Sheriffs of, or Commissioners from
Shires, or otherwise.</P>

(a word compounded out of the British and

Burgh with Wings.</HI> From Wings therefore
we must fetch the reason of the Name: and
fetched it may be, if you think good, either
from the <HI>Companies of Horsemen,</HI> which are
called Wings, or else from those <HI>Wings</HI> in Ar∣chitecture,
which the great Master builders
term <HI>Petromata,</HI> that is, as <HI>Vetruvius</HI> shew∣eth,

<P>Which thing <HI>Julius, Agricola,</HI> who march∣ed

who came into <HI>Brittain</HI> in person about

gave commandment that the <HI>God Terminus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">God Terminus</NOTE>

<HI>But when the northern Nations in the
Reign of</HI> Commodus, <HI>having passed once over
the Wall, had made much waste and spoil in
the Country, the Emperor</HI> Severus <HI>repai∣red
this Wall of</HI> Hadrian. <HI>Howbeit after∣wards
the</HI> Romans <HI>brought oft-times the
Country lying between under their subjecti∣on.
For</HI> Ninius <HI>hath recorded, that</HI> Carau∣sius
<HI>under</HI> Dioclesian, <HI>strengthened this Wall
another time, and fortified it with seven
Castles. Lastly, the</HI> Romans <HI>fenced this
place (when</HI> Theodosius <HI>the younger was Em∣peror)
under the conduct of</HI> Gallio <HI>of</HI> Ra∣venna.
Now, saith <HI>Bede,</HI> they made a Turff
Wall, rearing it not so much with Stone as with
Turfs, (as having no cunning Artificer for so
great a piece of Work) and the same to no use,
between two Firths or Arms of the Sea, for ma∣ny
miles in length: that where the fense of Wa∣ter
was wanting, there by the help of a Wall,
they might defend there Borders from the Inva∣sion
of enemies: of which work, that is to say a
very broad and high Wall, a man may see to this
day, most certain and evident Remains.</P>
<P>This Wall began as is generally believed,
at the River <HI>Aven,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ninius.</NOTE> that goeth into <HI>Edinburgh
Firth,</HI> and having passed over the River
of <HI>Carron,</HI> reacheth unto <HI>Dunbarton:</HI> but <HI>Bede</HI>
affirmeth, that it beginneth in a place called
<HI>Pen-vael,</HI> that is in the <HI>Picts</HI> Language, as
much as <HI>the head of the Wall;</HI> in the <HI>Brittains</HI>

<HI>Scottish Cevall:</HI> all which names no doubt are

to <HI>Bede</HI> at <HI>Al. cluid;</HI> after <HI>Ninius</HI> at the
City <HI>Pen Aloloyt,</HI> which may seem all one.</P>
<P>Now this Wall is commonly called <HI>Gra∣hams
Dyke;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Grahams dyke.</NOTE> either of <HI>Graham</HI> a Warlike <HI>Scot,</HI>
whose Valour was especially seen when the
breach was made through it, or else of the
Hill <HI>Grampie,</HI> at the foot whereof it stood.
The Author of <HI>Rota Temporum</HI> calleth it the
Wall of <HI>Aber. corneth,</HI> that is, <HI>of the mouth of
the River</HI> Corneth: where, in <HI>Bedes</HI> time,
<HI>there was a famous Monasterie standing, as he
hath recorded, upon</HI> English <HI>Ground, but near
unto that Firth or Arm of the Sea, which in
those days severed the Lands of the</HI> English <HI>and
the</HI> Picts.</P>
<P>Hard by this Wall of Turff, what way as
the River <HI>Carron</HI> crosseth this Sheriffdom of
<HI>Stirling,</HI> toward the left hand are seen two

call <HI>Duni-pacis</HI> that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duni-Pacis.</NOTE> <HI>Knolls of peace.</HI> Near

Viscount of <HI>Kilsyth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">V. Kilsyth.</NOTE> which Dignity his
Son now enjoyeth: (here the Marquess of
<HI>Montross</HI> obtained a signal Victory.) And
almost two Miles lower, there is an ancient
round Building four and twenty Cubits high,
and thirteen broad, open in the Top, framed
of rough Stone without Lime, having the
upper part of every Stone so tenanted into
the nether, as that the whole work still rising
narrow by a mutual interlacing and clasping,
upholdeth it self. Some call this the Temple
of <HI>God Terminus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arthurs Oven.</NOTE> others <HI>Arthurs-Oven,</HI> who
father every stately and sumptuous thing upon
<HI>Arthur.</HI> Others again, <HI>Julius Hoff,</HI> and sup∣pose
it to have been built by <HI>Julius Cesar.</HI>
But I would think rather that <HI>Julius Agricola</HI>
built it, who fortified this frontier part, were
it not that <HI>Ninius</HI> hath already informed us,
that it was erected by <HI>Carausius</HI> for a tri∣umphal
Arch. <HI>For he,</HI> as <HI>Ninius</HI> writeth,
<HI>built upon the Bank of</HI> Carron, <HI>a round house
of polished Stone, erecting a triumphal Arch in
memorial of a victory: he re-edified also the
Wall, and strengthened it with seven Castles.</HI>
The mid space between <HI>Duni-pacis</HI> and
this Building, on the right hand Bank of <HI>Car∣ron,</HI>
there is yet to be discerned a confused
face of a little ancient City: where the vul∣gar
people believeth there was sometimes a

commonly called <HI>Striviling,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">B. Royal.</NOTE> and <HI>Stirling</HI> Burgh;
where on the very brow of a steep Rock, there
is mounted on high, a passing strong Castle of
the Kings, which King <HI>James</HI> the Sixth beau∣tified
with new Buildings, and where of a
long time the Lords of <HI>Areskine</HI> Earls of <HI>Marr</HI>
have been Captains, unto whom the Charge
and Tuition of the Princes of <HI>Scotland,</HI> during

their Minority, have been at other times com∣mitted.
Whereas some there be, that would
have the good and lawful money of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
which is called <HI>Sterling</HI> money, to take
the name from hence, they are much deceived:
for that Denomination came from the <HI>Ger∣mans,</HI>

<P>About two Miles hence, the <HI>Banock-burn</HI> run∣neth
between exceeding high Banks on both

toward the <HI>Forth:</HI> a Burn most famous for as
glorious a Victory as ever the <HI>Scots</HI> had,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of <HI>Ba∣nock-burn.</HI></NOTE> what
time as <HI>Edward</HI> the Second King of <HI>England,</HI>
was put to flight, who was fain to make hard

Army which <HI>England</HI> had before sent
out, was discomfited through the valiant
prowess of King <HI>Robert Bruce,</HI> insomuch as

this Territory without the Burgh; but have
been of a long time Earls of <HI>Marr,</HI> from a

The Sheriffship of this Shire belongs to the

was the Kings Lieutenant in <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI>
and had Precedency of all those Baronets:

<P>To conclude this Chapter, take here a
Description of the principal Seal of the Burgh
of <HI>Stirling,</HI> which carries on the one side a
Bridge of seven Arches, with a Cross mount∣ed
on the the middle, and armed men on each
side of the Cross, with this Inscription,
<Q>Hic armis Bruti, <HI>Scoti</HI> stant hic Cruce tuti.</Q></P>
<P>And on the other side a large strong Castle
in a Wood, with this Motto,
<Q>Continet hoc in se Nemus &amp; Castrum <HI>Striv∣lingnense.</HI></Q>
Which two Inscriptions they give us in Eng∣lish
thus,
<Q><L>The <HI>Brittains</HI> stand by force of Arms,</L>
<L>The <HI>Scots</HI> are by this Cross preserv'd from Harms.</L></Q>
<Q><PB N="108" REF="59"/>
<L>The Castle and the Wood of <HI>Stirling</HI> town,</L>
<L>Are in the compass of this Seal set down.</L></Q>
Which agreeth well with what <HI>Buchanan</HI>
said, that the River <HI>Carron</HI> was the Bounda∣ry
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Conquests, and <HI>Stirling</HI> the
Limits of the <HI>Brittains</HI> and <HI>Scots.</HI> However
it be, the Seal and Inscription must be very
old, when special notice is taken of a Wood
at <HI>Stirling,</HI> whereof there is but small Re∣mains;
and at this place, doth the River
<HI>Forth</HI> admit of a Bridge, which is the secure
Passage betwixt the South and North of <HI>Scot∣land.</HI></P>

<P>WHatsoever part of <HI>Brittain</HI> lyeth
northward beyond <HI>Grahams Dyke,</HI>
or the Wall of <HI>Antoninus Pius</HI> be∣fore
named, and beareth out on both Seas, is
called by <HI>Tacitus, Caledonia,</HI> likeas the people
thereof <HI>Brittains</HI> inhabiting <HI>Caledonia. Pto∣lemy</HI>
divideth them into many Nations, as
<HI>Caledonii, Epidii, Vacomagi, &amp;c.</HI> who were
all of them afterward, for continuing their
ancient manner and custom of painting their
Bodies, named by the <HI>Romans</HI> and provin∣cial
people, <HI>Picts:</HI> divided by <HI>Ammianus
<PB N="109" REF="59"/>
Marcellinus</HI> into two Nations, the <HI>Dicalido∣nes</HI>
and <HI>Vecturiones:</HI> howbeit in the approved
and best Writers, they go all under the name
of <HI>Caledonians;</HI> whom I would think to have
been so called of <HI>Kaled,</HI> a <HI>Brittish</HI> word that
signifieth <HI>Hard,</HI> and in the plural Number
maketh <HI>Kaledion,</HI> whence the word <HI>Caledo∣nii</HI>
may be derived, that is to say, <HI>hard, rough,
uncivil,</HI> and a <HI>wilder kind of people,</HI> such as
the northern Nations for the most part are;
who by reason of the rigorous cold of the
Air, are more rough and fierce, and for
their abundance of Blood, more bold and ad∣venturous.
Moreover, beside the position
of the Climat, this is furthered by the na∣ture
and condition of the Soil, which riseth
up all throughout, with rough and rugged
Mountains; and Mountainers, verily all men
know and confess to be hardy, stout, and
strong. But whereas <HI>Varro</HI> alledgeth out of
<HI>Pacuvius,</HI> that <HI>Caledonia breedeth and nourish∣eth
men of exceeding big Bodies,</HI> I would un∣derstand
the place rather of <HI>Caledonia</HI> the Re∣gion
of <HI>Epirus,</HI> than this of our; although
ours may also justly challenge unto it self this
commendation. Among this was the Wood
<HI>Caledonia,</HI> termed by <HI>Lucius Florus, Saltus Ca∣ledonius,</HI>
that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caledon For∣rest.</NOTE> the Forrest of <HI>Caledonia,</HI>
spreading out a mighty way, and impassible
by reason of tall Trees standing so thick, di∣vided
also by <HI>Gramp</HI> Hill, now called <HI>Gra∣nizbain,</HI>
that is, <HI>the crooked bending Mountain.</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="60"/>
That <HI>Vlysses</HI> arrived in <HI>Caledonia,</HI> (saith <HI>So∣linus)
appeareth plainly by a votive Altar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ulysses his Altar.</NOTE> <HI>with
an Inscription in Greek letters;</HI> but I would
judge it to have been rather erected to the ho∣nour
of <HI>Vlysses,</HI> than reared by <HI>Vlysses</HI> him∣self.
<HI>Martial</HI> the Poet likewise in this Verse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caledonian Bears.</NOTE>
maketh mention of <HI>Caeledonian Bears,</HI>
<Q>Nuda <HI>Caledonio</HI> sic pectora praebuit urso.</Q>
<Q><L>Thus yielded he his naked Breast,</L>
<L>To <HI>Bear</HI> of <HI>Caledonian</HI> Forrest.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Plutarch</HI> also hath written, that <HI>Bears</HI> were
brought out of <HI>Brittain</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> and had
there in great admiration; whereas notwith∣standing
<HI>Brittain</HI> for these many Ages past,
hath bred none. What <HI>Caledonian</HI> Monster
that should be, whereof <HI>Claudian</HI> wrote thus,
<Q><L>—Caledonio velata Britannia monstro,</L></Q>
<Q><L><HI>With Monster</HI> Caledonian Brittain <HI>all attir'd</HI></L></Q>
To tell you truth, it is uncertain, that it
nourished in times past,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caledonian Bulls.</NOTE> a number of white
wild <HI>Bulls,</HI> with thick Mains in manner of
<HI>Lyons,</HI> (but in these days few) and those very
cruel, fierce, and so hateful of Mankind, that
for a certain time they abhorred whatsoever
they had either handled or breathed upon:
yea, they utterly scorn the forcible strength
of <HI>Dogs;</HI> albeit <HI>Rome</HI> in times past, wonder∣ed
<PB N="111" REF="60"/>
at the fierceness of <HI>Scottish Dogs,</HI> that it
was thought there, they were brought thi∣ther
within Iron Grates and Cages. But
this term and name <HI>Caledonii</HI> grew so rise
with <HI>Roman</HI> Writers, that they used it for
all <HI>Brittain,</HI> and for all Woods of <HI>Brittain</HI>
whatsoever. Hereupon <HI>Lucius Florus</HI> writ∣eth,
that <HI>Caesar</HI> followed the <HI>Brittains</HI> unto
the <HI>Caledonian Woods,</HI> and yet he never saw
them in his life: hence also <HI>Valerius Flaccus</HI>
writeth thus to <HI>Vespasian</HI> the Emperor,
<Q><L>—Caledonius postquam tua carbasa vexit
<HI>Oceanus:</HI></L></Q> that is, the Brittish Ocean.</P>

thus unto <HI>Crispinus,</HI> Son of <HI>Vectius Volanus</HI>
Proprietar of <HI>Brittain,</HI> about the time of <HI>Vi∣tellius.</HI>

the <HI>Scots</HI> to be comprehended under these
Northern unconquered Nations, who made
Opposition to the <HI>Romans,</HI> and to pass under
the name of the <HI>caledonians,</HI> and others as
he owns the <HI>Picts</HI> were: albeit there is the

<HI>Picts</HI> in these Martial Feats against the <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI>
from the Latine Authours themselves,

the Seas which the <HI>Roman</HI> Enemies were
driven over, were the Firths of <HI>Edinburgh</HI>
from the East, and of <HI>Dunbartoun</HI> from the

made some late Writers imagine, against the

these times, were not setled Inhabitants

<P>Before I end the Description of this Coun∣try

in the Limits of <HI>Fife</HI> and <HI>Strathern,</HI> of whose
Inscription Sir <HI>John Skeen</HI> took notice, that the
Priviledges of <HI>Clan Macduff</HI> were expressed
in barbarons Verses, whereof he gives a short
hint in his <HI>de verborum significatione;</HI> of which
Mr. <HI>James Cunninghame</HI> has given a more

<P>But one <HI>Dowglass</HI> in <HI>New-burgh,</HI> near to
Cross <HI>Macduff,</HI> had by him a Version, which
seems to be much more probable, and agree∣able
to the Matter, which reads thus,

<P>Here seems to be wanting a Line of the In∣scription,
which is lost, or could not be read

sweat out Frankincense and Balm, so in the
Islands and other Countries in the West there
be Woods and Groves of a more fatty and firm
Substance, which melting by the hot Beams of
the Sun approaching so near, runneth into the
Sea hard by, and by force of Tempest, floateth
up to the hoars against it.</HI> But <HI>Serapio,</HI> and
the Philosophers of later times write, that it
ariseth out of a certain clammy and bitumin∣ous
Earth under the Sea, and by the Sea∣side;
and that the Billows and Tempests cast
up part thereof a land, and a Fishes devour
the rest.</P>

<P>This Charter is special, both because of
the Antiquity related to, and the great num∣ber
of famous and considerable Witnesses,
and especially of the King of the Isles, (whom
I just now mentioned) before four Earls,
and albeit the Earl of <HI>Angus</HI> be only
designed by his Earldom, yet the other three
were certainly <HI>Cospatricius</HI> Earl of <HI>Dumbar,</HI>
or <HI>March, Ferteth</HI> Earl of <HI>Strathern,</HI> who
was Father of <HI>Gilbert</HI> before mentioned, and
<HI>Duncan</HI> Earl of <HI>Fife,</HI> and <HI>Vchtred</HI> was Lord
of <HI>Galloway,</HI> and Father of <HI>Rolland.</HI> This
Note <HI>I</HI> took from the Principal Charter,
which if <HI>I</HI> had at hand, <HI>I</HI> would have
inserted the Tenor, and the Initial Let∣ters
as they are Gilded, containing the Effi∣gies
and <HI>Regalia</HI> of the Kings <HI>David</HI> and
<HI>Malcolm.</HI></P>
<P>This Charter is again confirmed by King

Brother, to whose Charter the Witnesses

my Brother, <HI>Archibald</HI> Abbot of <HI>Dum∣fermling,
