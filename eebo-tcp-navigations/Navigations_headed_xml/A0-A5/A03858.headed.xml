<OPENER><SALUTE>THRISE ILLVSTRI∣ous, reuerend, generous, magnificent and noble Lordes, our approoued good friendes and woorthily respected neighbours, with our heartiest salutation we heere offer you all our seruice.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Ll the worlde knoweth that these broyles of warre &amp; com∣motions in gouernment haue not without iust occasion been stirred vp, and that our enter∣prise in betaking vs to our armes, neither did nor doth ayme at the offence of any man: but was onely in∣tended for the standing vpon our owne garde, and the repelling of so many and so grieuous iniuries which heeretofore we haue beene subiect vnto. Neuertheles fearing least our silence might be a preiudice vnto vs and brande vs with some blame because of the weale-publike of Christendome, we thought it conuenient, to acquaint you in fewe
<PB REF="3"/>termes with the first motiues of these tumults, that (occasion offring it selfe) you might the rather ex∣cuse &amp; iustifie our proceedings both to your neigh∣bour Christian Princes, as also to all others of the foresaid Christian common-weale.</P>
<P>You shall vnderstand then that his sacred Im∣periall and royall Maiestie hauing infringed the oth wherin he was bound and obliged vnto this realme, hauing violated and disanuld all the rights, immuni∣ties, liberties &amp; priuiledges which for so many espe∣ciall merits &amp; rare vertues had of a long time beene conferd vpon our predecessours by the holy kings of Hungary: hath notwithstanding without either regard of our bodies, our goods, or respect of iu∣stice, nobilitie or religion, as it were abandoned and prostituted vs to the mercilesse mercy of his men of warre, our bodies for the exercising of their cruel∣ties, and our spoiles for the enriching of their bags: himselfe lending a deafe eare to our so pitifull and so many supplications formed and presented vnto him within these 20 yeeres at his Diets and general assemblies in Possonia: as also he lightly passed ouer those relations and remonstrances offred vnto him by Ambassadours sent vp by the Estates of the realme for the same purpose. True it is that cer∣taine yeeres past his foresaide Maiestie sent to our succour one <HI>George Basta</HI> accompanied with an ar∣mie of sundrie nations, and amongst them no fewe Wallons: but he was so farre from employing his force in our defence, that he graunted his souldiours absolute commission to put land and countrie to fire
<PB REF="3"/>and sword; as also to raunsacke, beate downe and leuell with the grounde the new-pilled and lately robbed houses of the Noblemen. And although he had sufficiently prouided for the most of his garde and such as were nighest about him, yet was there no consideration nor respect had at all: for the Wallons for all this ceased not to surprise, sacke and ruinate whole Townes, Villages, Burrowes and No∣blemens castles, whom they massacred with∣out respect, as they did also the Ministers of the worde of God, fleaing some of them as yet aliue. They likewise seconded their crueltie with all filthines and infamous beastlinesse, raping and forcing women euen to death: and without all manner of regard of either youth or age, they spared neither yongue gyrles nor (which is more) women nowe ready to bee brought to bedde, nay nor those which now they found in trauaile, whō they forced &amp; ra∣uisht with a farre more than beastly crueltie. Moreouer against all right and iustice yawning and gaping for our goods and possessions, he tooke counsaile of his familiars and best-trusted friends, of many sleights and tricks of legerde∣maine, whereby he might either snatch and extort, or at leastwise confiscate whatsoeuer we had. All which inuentions and mischieuous practises he wrought by the meanes of his Ger∣man captaines, whose seruice he likewise vsed
<PB REF="4"/>in the tormenting of our persons, and especi∣ally of theirs of the Nobilitie, who poore soules tooke no rest: for he casting them into prison for all the torments they endured was neuer v∣sed to release them, before such times as they bought their liberties full dearely. And his custome was by the same meanes for the re∣leasing of their imprisonment to take of them a great and solemne oath that they would neuer bethinke them of that excessiue wrong they had endured, nor euer by iustice, lawes or any other way goe about to recouer some satisfa∣ction, as likewise they should neuer meddle with the recouering of such heritages and re∣uenews which had been taken from them and bestowed vpon strangers. And which is more, his imperiall Maiesty for the space of thirteen yeares, during which our warres lasted, neuer deigned as much as once to honour our Realme with his presence: that after so many mischiefes he might bestow as it were a brea∣thing space vpon so many of his faithfull and poore distressed subiects: who in all their gene∣rall Parliaments, renewed euery yeare and very chargeable vnto them, had put vp vnto his Maiestie so many and so earnest petitions and supplications: insomuch as many priuate men vpon their owne costs were faine to make a voyage vnto Pragues and there to cast them∣selues into his Maiesties armes, beseeching his
<PB REF="4"/>mercy and crauing iustice: but their cries were little regarded, onely they were sent to certaine Counsellours, who after a formall kind of iu∣stice dispatched them in the maner of an<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">D'uneac∣quit.</NOTE> ac∣quiting: so as the most part was faine to returne without ought doing, with strange outcries and complaints for want of iustice. His Ma∣iesty himselfe altogether as oft as pleased him, directly against the customes and statutes of the Realme, caused his iudgements to be done and put in execution out of the limits of the foresaid Realme: to whom who so resisted (howbeit such powers had been referred to common as∣semblies or parliaments) was presently puni∣shed. Witnesses be the most honorable Lords, <HI>Steeuen Illyeszarye,</HI> now banished and bereaft of all his reuenews vpon this occasion: and <HI>Iohn Leo,</HI> a most honourable man and a great Iusticier, with their Counsellours, <HI>Diazy, Bam∣fy, Sigismunde, Sarmasagly, Ladistas, Gyolafy, Iohn Imrify, George</HI> and <HI>Valentine Homelay,</HI> as also the famous <HI>George Sabo,</HI> who, how they haue beene dealt withall, all men know. And making no account or esteeme of a naturall Hungarian, he inuested strangers with all the offices and estates of the Realme: which is no∣thing else but to abastardise and violate the law and libertie of the Realme, a thing most vio∣lent and neuer put in practise in any countrey.
<PB REF="5" MS="y"/>Lastly, to be briefe, our wiues, our children, our brethren, our sisters, our parents and allies and what else we possessed, lay at their com∣maund, and they disposed of it according to their good will and pleasure. Nowe with what hart-pearcing griefe we endured all these crosses, we referre to the iudgement of those who stripped of all affections be plaine louers of publique honesty and zealous of the law of God. Yet haue we endured all these thinges with such and so great patience as al our neigh∣bour Realmes held vs in admiration: and for all this neuer enterprised any thing till we per∣ceiued how they of the Clergie against all right and reason and the ordinances of the Realme, not content with their owne limits, wrigold themselues vnto estates and offices, to the great disparagement of the laity, and snatching the authority of Iustice, withdrew to themselues all honors and dignities: wherewith not satis∣fied they further pried how to depriue vs of our liberty, and which is worse, haue aduentured to tempt our Religion, employing for that purpose diuers persons to quash and quench in vs our Orthodoxall and true confession of faith. Now the Ecclesiasticall liuings which anciently were by his Maiesties Father and Grand-father, as also by the Generals of their armies and principall Chiefetaynes of warre,
<PB REF="5"/>bestowed for the reliefe of our publique necessi∣ties and the maintaining and managing of a continuall warre, and thereupon became im∣pledgde and morgagde to our predecessours: are nowe become the pray and the bootie of Church-men. Who, by vnlawfull meanes, vsurpe and snatch them from the true owners and with their proceedings in Ecclesiasticall courts, being both Iudges and parties, doe in∣finitely molest both the Nobility and the com∣mon people also, blind-fowlding and enuelop∣ing them with the punishment of excommuni∣cation; the onelie meanes of absolution from the which, is to resort fraught with fatte and honourable presents, which in the end bring∣eth them to a most miserable pouertie.</P>
<P>Moreouer in this last Diet, they of the realm hauing presented certain articles to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Sai serenite, meaning the Archduke.</NOTE> his High∣nesse (who was there present with all the po∣wer and puissance of his Maiesty as represen∣ting his person) and his Highnesse accepting of them, they of the Church notwithstanding in a manifest disdaine both of his Highnesse and the rest of the Princes, adding, paring, changing and blotting out many points con∣tained in that bil of request, did maime and cor∣rupt it altogether.</P>
<P>Furthermore the Wallons set on by some of the Bishops and suffring themselues to be ca∣ried
<PB REF="6"/>away with their owne passions, hauing, in a manner neuer heard of before, tormented the Ministers of the word of God, in the end massacred them most bloudily: and passing further, fleshing themselues vpon their dead and now interred carcasses: vnburied and burnt them starke-naked. And amongst many moe, they spared not the dead bodies of the noble and illustrious Lord <HI>George,</HI> Earle of Bathor, his wife and his parents: and it is incredible how inhumanely they vsed the dead body of that honorable Counte <HI>Stephen Bathor.</HI> The armes of the Earle <HI>George Bathor</HI> found with∣in his tombe are at this instant in the possession of the aboue named <HI>George Basta,</HI> and borne by him. In the ende setting forward to pull downe the temple of <HI>Cassouia,</HI> to banish and chase out all the Ministers and professours of true religion to seaze violently vpon all the goods of the said towne, and all this against the aduise of <HI>Iohn Iacob Barbian,</HI> Earle of Belioy∣ense &amp; Gouernour of high Hungary: as also of <HI>Francis Torgat,</HI> Chancellour and Bishop of Ni∣ter. When we saw these stratagems: we, in the name of all the Realme, mette together at the generall assembly holden at Possonia, and there wrought all our endeuours by praiers and supplications vnto his Highnesse, that hee would hinder that resolution and ward of that
<PB REF="6"/>blow, humbly beseeching his Serenitie that for the conseruation of peace, these affaires of Re∣ligion might be passed ouer and deferd vntill some other time: but for all that we did our vt∣most deuoir, yet could we obtaine nothing at all, and thereupon at the very same instance we made our complaints with protestations in the presence of his foresaide<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Serenité.</NOTE> Highnesse and the Estates of the Realme. But in steed of a good and curteous answeare which we promised our selues, his Maiestie quite contrary of his owne proper disposition neuer acquainting the E∣states withall: and in meere misprision of their authority (a thing neuer heeretofore practised by any King of Hungary) dared boldly of his absolute power to insert a most pernicious and horrible Article among the rest which mena∣ced and threatned no lesse vnto vs, than the vt∣ter losse and confusion of our substance, our possessions, our liues, yea and our very soules, with the quite abolishing and rooting out of all the Hungarian nation. And by this time for an earnest pennie and a sure testimony of his good will, he had already by his most rigorous briefes, proceeded in the banishing of the Archbishop of Coloarense, that by this means hee might with the greater facility make him∣selfe master of the Temple, the Parish and the Vniuersity of Lutchenien. Now to delay and
<PB REF="7"/>allay the current of so many mischiefes, setting before our eies all such things as had passed as also those flames which more began to worke our vtter ruine and confusion: by authority of our common assembly called for this purpose in the towne of Galred in the presence of the foresaid Earle of Belioyense and of them of the chamber of Sepuse, and he himselfe of whom we spak assisting: we solemnely swore to persist constantly in that protestation which we had so authentically made in the Diet of Possonia: and that we would maintaine and defend our selues by those decrees of <HI>Andrew,</HI> the second, called King of Ierusalem, which he enacted in the yeare 12.22. Art. 31. and they be of this substance.
<Q>Now if either we or any one of our succes∣sours in any time whatsoeuer, go against this our pleasure, we licence our subiects and giue them all power to contradict and resist vs, so as afterward they may neuer be branded with any note of treason or infamy for the same.</Q></P>
<P>And in the first Epistle, the ninth Tit. of that Tripartite worke of the lawes of Hungary, he saith expresly:
<Q>Let this be the fourth and absolute liberty, if any of the Kings or Princes happen to dero∣gate from the freedome of the Noble men &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>As it followeth in the decrees of the fore∣said
<PB REF="7"/>most excellent Prince <HI>Andrew</HI> the second entituled King of Ierusalem: and for the more strict obseruation thereof, euery true King of Hungary, before his coronation is bound and accustomed to sweare the obseruance of the same conditions: to wit, To permit and con∣sent that men rise vp in armes against him without any note of treason, in such cases: as when he goeth in any thing about to restraine from them their libertie. But in the Articles of the Diet held at Possonia, 1604. about the end there is one last of all which hath beene vnlaw∣fully and forcibly added and couched in, and it goeth thus:</P>
<P>Lastly, his sacred Imperiall and royall Ma∣iestie hauing vnderstood not without great dis∣pleasure as well by reports woorthy of credit, as by two requests by which the forenamed high prince <HI>Mathias</HI> Archduke of Austria, his most deere brother, besought him to take part with them, who termed themselues the better and sounder part of the estate and order of the Realme of Hungary (of the which vnusuall and vncoth kind of speech he much marueiled, as also for their complaints of troubling their exercises of Religion, wasting their Churches and reuenewes in expences, and chasing away of their Ministers and preachers: of the which they had heeretofore complained to his High∣nesse,
<PB REF="8"/>both by writing and worde of mouth, as also by ample declarations, and also be∣sought him to be a mediatour vnto his Maie∣stie for the restitution of such thinges as had beene violently taken from them, that so they might heereafter liue freely in the profession of their religion, who notwithstanding sollicited by his Highnes to declare more especially, and to specifie at large the subiect of their writing, and the authours of the same, could neuer be brought to say any thing, nor to giue any fur∣ther declaration either of the profession of their religion, or of what Churches, what reuenewes had beene taken away from them, of the which they onely complained in generall termes, not discending to any particulars) and that conti∣nuing in their male-contentednes, it was im∣possible to alter this their opinion: such dis∣cord I say, being of no small power to slacken and weaken the effects of al treatises in the Par∣liament, besides that it is a great scandall and an ill example to other States of the realme, could not but much aggreeue his Highnesse &amp; his sacred Maiestie: who, all astonisht cannot call to minde what iniuries or what fasheries they pretend to haue receiued in matters of re∣ligion, nor what Churches, what reuenewes, especially hereditary or ancient, could be ta∣ken from them. His foresaid Maiesty is likewise
<PB REF="8"/>in doubt and can hardly bee resolued seeing their tumultuous pretences, which make him thinke, nay halfe perswade him, that by the meanes of their religion they haue practised some intelligence with the free cities of the realme, which be the proper demaines of his imperiall Maiesty as well knowen King of Hungary. Now euen as his sacred imperiall and royall Maiesty in imitation of so many ho∣ly Romane Emperours and Kings of Hungary his ancestours and predecessours, vnfaignedly embraceth with ardent zeale the Catholike Romane religion, so in like manner he purpo∣seth and desireth aboue all thinges, when hee hath purified and clensed it of all false opini∣ons and new-found doctrines, to make it to the glory and praise of the Almighty God, en∣crease and flourish in all his realmes and pro∣uinces: but especially in this realme of Hunga∣ry to maintaine and defend it with all his po∣wer, as by the bond of his owne vocation hee findes himselfe obliged. Heereupon his facred imperiall Maiesty of his owne proper motion and of his royall and absolute power doth con∣firme all those ordinances, statutes and de∣crees which heeretofore haue beene addressed for the aduancement of the aforesaid Catho∣like and Romane faith, aswell by King <HI>Stephen,</HI> the Apostle of the Hungarian nation, as by o∣ther
<PB REF="9"/>deuout kings of Hungary his predeces∣sours: all which constitutions he fully ratifies by this present Article, as if they had beene word by word heere specified. And to the end that heereafter in generall Assemblies &amp; Diets where are handled matters of great importance and consequence concerning realmes, no man shall dare presume vpon any incident colou∣red pretext to insert any point or affaires of re∣ligion which might slacken the foresaid pub∣like affaires: his sacred Maiesty wils and com∣mands that vpon most rigorous paines such a one escape not vnpunished: but that immedi∣ately men proceede against him and all such semblable brablers, louers and embracers of nouelties: and that without any remission or pardon they bee seuerely chastised and puni∣shed, following the decrees enacted against such by our predecessours, the Kings of Hun∣gary, so that others by their correction may learne and take example.</P>
<P>But leaue we these thinges as others, which to endure longer is impossible, iudging by the former that there remaines no speedier meanes to ridde vs of this insupportable yoke, than the taking of armes, which we will imploy vp∣on such as practising against our religion and libertie, endeuour to roote out the Hungari∣an nation. Now to the end men shoulde not
<PB REF="9"/>take vs for Apostates from the Christian faith, or beleeue that we of set purpose bandi∣ed or emploied our forces against any that pro∣fessed Christianity, we thought it good to giue your thrise illustrious, respect woorthy, Gene∣rous, Magnificent, and noble Lordships, our good and ancient neighbours a tast of our in∣tention and of the cause of our commotions: to the end you might vnderstand that neither pride, nor ambition, nor hatred conceiued a∣gainst any Christian prince moued vs to the ta∣king of armes, but an holy desire of protecting and defending our selues against the oppres∣sors of our freedome and our true and Ortho∣doxall religion. As touching the aid we haue from the Turke and the Tartar we reserue them for no other end, but to let the king of Poland and Moldauia see, that wee want not where∣withall to serue our selues in time of need; it be∣ing in our power to send them backe againe when it shall please vs. Now although wee know that of all antiquity the Duchie of Silisie doth appertain as an inheritance of the realme of Hungary, yet were we willing to entertaine their good neighbourhood, liuing in good peace and amitie, which heeretofore we haue kept inuiolably. Wherefore we thought conue∣nient to inform you rightly of our deed, &amp; like∣wise to eertifie you that we perswade our selues
<PB REF="10"/>you haue no sinister opinion of vs for employ∣ing our powers in so good and so iust a cause, which certainly is yours also, both being in very deed as it were embarkt in the selfe same ves∣sell: nay wee further are of this beleefe, that you calling to minde our auncient league of amitie, will rather commend then dispraise, our iust and resolute enterprise: Concerning which point, wee humbly pray you to let vs freely vnderstand of your aduise, deferring vntill some more conuenient time to make you an ample discouerie of our deliberation, which neither was nor is to warre vpon the kingdome of Bohemia, nor Silesia, nor the Marques of Morauia, vnlesse they giue vs too much occa∣sion: howbeit wee know very well they haue heeretofore beene vnder the crowne of the realme of Hungary. But as heeretofore wee haue often tolde you, our desire is to employ all our forces against those destroiers, firers, murtherers and massacrers of our brethren, with which instruments the house of Ametria, hath so long to our great mischiefe, reard vp his crest. Wee thought it therefore necessary and conuenient (most famous, magnificent and noble Lords) to certifie you of these things in few words to whom (for a conclusion) we wish all goodnesse and happinesse. Dated at our
<PB REF="10"/>royall Citie of Cassouie, the 24. of Aprill. 1605.</P>
