<HEAD>THE BOOKSELLER TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THis Piece is not pub∣lish'd so much for the Profit of the
<HI>Book∣seller,</HI> as of the <HI>Reader:</HI> For it is but a Little One; and there is but Little to be gotten by it: So that with∣out any other Recommenda∣tion, I shall leave the Work <PB REF="4"/> to speak for it self. The Drawing of the <HI>WORLD</HI> into this <HI>Epitome,</HI> is out of pure good Will to such as have Curiosity enough perchance, but neither Time nor Money to take a View of it more at large. And this Charitable Intention of the <HI>Abstracter,</HI> hath been accompanied with a singu∣lar Care in the manner of Doing it; and to supply in <HI>Weight,</HI> what is want∣ing in
<HI>Bulk:</HI> That is to say,</P>
<P>Here is a most exact Account given of the Ʋ∣niverse it self, and of <PB REF="4"/> every Part of it; the Sci∣tuation of all the King∣doms in it; States, Pro∣vinces, Cities and Domi∣nions: together with their respective Limits and Ju∣risdictions; their Growth and Commodities; with the principal Rivers, Palaces, and other things remarka∣ble: The Quality of the Soyl, the Temperature of the Climate, with the Re∣ligion, Manners, Disposi∣tions, Laws and Customs of the People: and some Touches upon their Inte∣rests, Alliances, and De∣pendences.</P>
<P><PB REF="5"/>To which are added, certain Advices for Tra∣vellers.</P>
<P>This is the Brief of this <HI>Compendium;</HI> and the
<HI>Bookseller</HI> hath nothing more to say, but that he wishes Health to the Rea∣der.</P>

<HEAD>The Islands of the Virgi∣nian Ocean.</HEAD>
<P>ARe <HI>Margarica Cubagna,</HI> the <HI>Baccaloes, Boriquen, Jamaica, Cuba, Bermude</HI> and <HI>Hispaniola.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Margarica Cubagna.</HI></NOTE><HI>Margarica Cubagna;</HI> these two Islands are situate nigh unto <HI>Castella Aurea:</HI> they are deficient in Corn, Grass, Trees, Water, but they abound in precious Stones, which make some amends for these defects. Nigh un∣to these is the Island
<HI>Trinadado,</HI> well stored with Tobacco of the best.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Boluccoes.</HI></NOTE><HI>Boluccoes;</HI> these are certain Islands lying against the Influx of <HI>Ca∣nada,</HI> nigh unto
<HI>Corterialis.</HI> The People of these Islands in a formal expression of reverence use to rub their Noses, or stroke their Fore∣heads.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Boriquen.</HI></NOTE><HI>Boriquen,</HI> or St. <HI>Johns,</HI> is 300 miles long, and 70 broad, traversed <PB N="340" REF="180"/> with a rough Mountain, which yields many Rivers. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> have there some Towns; the chief where∣of are St <HI>Johns,</HI> and <HI>Port Rico.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jamaica.</HI></NOTE><HI>Jamaica</HI> is almost as large as <HI>Bo∣riquen:</HI> it is extreamly troubled with such terrible gusts of Wind, that nothing can resist them, turn∣ing up Trees, and over-turning Houses, transporting Ships from Sea to Land with a terrible confusi∣on. The Inhabitants here are of quicker wits than the other Islands.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ciba.</HI></NOTE><HI>Ciba;</HI> this Island is more Norther∣ly, and extends it self 300 leagues in length, and
20 in breadth, full of Mountains, Woods,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ens, Rivers, Lakes both salt and fresh: the Woods are replenished with Swine and Kine; the Rivers with golden Sands; and the Soyl is replenished with Ginger, Cassia, Mastick, Aloes, Cynamon, Sugar. The chief Cities are S. <HI>Jago,</HI> a Bishops See; and <HI>Ha∣nana,</HI> a safe road for Ships, and the Staple of Merchandize. Here rides the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Navy, till time of year and conveniency of wind serve <PB N="341" REF="180"/> to waft them homeward. The other Towns of note are S. <HI>Christophero,</HI> and S. <HI>Trinity.</HI> Not far hence are the <HI>Lucacy,</HI> above 400 in num∣ber.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hispaniola.</HI></NOTE><HI>Hispaniola</HI> is East-ward from <HI>Cu∣ba:</HI> it is called by the natives <HI>Haiti;</HI> it containeth in compass 550 leagues, enjoying a temperate Air, and fertil Soyl, rich in Mines, Amber, and Su∣gar. This Island hath many high and craggy Hills, over-looking the deep and dark Valleys; but in many places it is most beautifull and flou∣rishing. It seemeth to enjoy a per∣petual Spring, the Trees alwayes flourishing, and the Meadows clo∣thed in green. The chief Towns are <HI>Dominigo,</HI> S. <HI>Jago,</HI> S. <HI>Thome,</HI> S <HI>John,</HI> and <HI>Portoroyo.</HI></P>

<PB REF="181"/>
<HEAD>Certain Precepts &amp; Observations for those that do intend to TRAVELL.</HEAD>
<PB REF="182"/>
<PB N="345" REF="182"/>
<HEAD>Let him that intends to travell, observe these Precepts.</HEAD>
<P>IN the first place let him solicite God daily for his protection, and let all his actions take beginning in him; let him omit no day where∣in he offers not up his Orisons to God, for his gracious protection in his intended purposes: let him be sure to observe this well, to keep constant to his God, and he shall find him to be a special friend in his greatest extremity.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let him have a special care be∣fore he go, to leave a carefull <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riend at home, that will keep credit with the Merchant that furnishes him with <PB N="346" REF="183"/> money abroad, lest his Friend's ill payments at home drive him to wants abroad: and for an ordinary expence to one that will live mode∣rately, some
50 or 60 <HI>l.</HI> sterling will serve to defray a Travellers Diet, and necessary Apparel.</P>
<P N="3">3. For his outward Necessaries, which are Cloathes, Books, and Money, let him carry no more with him than necessity requires. For his Apparel, let him not charge himself with overmuch luggage; and let him be sure in what Countrey soever he comes, (unless he will make himself ridiculous) that his Cloathes be in fashion. For his Books let them be few or none, es∣pecially such as are prohibited, lest upon suspition he be searched, (as they are at every Gate in <HI>Italy</HI>) be may bring himself into danger: Al∣so for the more caution, let the Notes of his Observations be taken in Ciphers or Characters; but pro∣vided that he be alwayes ready to give a fained interpretation. And for his money, let him carry no <PB N="347" REF="183"/> more with him than will defray his charge unto the next place he is to have his Bill payd; and let him be wary he shew not any quantity at any time about him, since Thieves have commonly their Spies in all Innes, to enquire after the conditions of Passen∣gers.</P>
<P N="4">4. Let him also before he go, learn some knowledge in the Art of <HI>Cosmography,</HI> for if he be ignorant of that, he will not know where he is, nor which foot to set forward: And also if he desire to learn the Lan∣guage of each Kingdom, (that is in most use in his own Countrey) let him resort to those places where the best Language is spoken; those are, <HI>Leipzich</HI> in <HI>Germany, Orleance</HI> in
<HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Florence</HI> in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. For his Observations, when he cometh into each Kingdom, let him observe the fruitfulness of each Countrey, the Commodity and ra∣rity wherewith each Countrey aboundeth and is adorn'd: Let him observe the policy of each State, and therein the Courts of each King or
<PB N="348" REF="184"/> Prince, with the Courtiers, Enter∣tainments, Offices and Fees: Let him also observe the traffick of Merchan∣dize, and the Commodity they car∣ry out, and most want, with their Havens, Roads for Ships, and the value of Coyn in each Countrey, and the several currant Pieces.</P>
<P>Likewise in the observation of any City, if the Traveller may without suspition, let him climbe up one of the highest Steeples, where having taken the situation of the City, he may at his coming to his Inne, draw the form of it.</P>
<P N="6">6. Let the Traveller take these Precepts along with him: If he in∣tend a journey to any place, let him take the seasonablest time of the year, and fittest time to travel, which is <HI>Spring</HI> and
<HI>Autumn;</HI> and he shall do well to go to cold Climes in Sum∣mer, and hot Climes in Winter: And if the journey he takes be long, let him not acquaint, no not his Companions nor Friends in his jour∣ney, the furthest end thereof, but rather from City to City, and pro∣fess <PB N="349" REF="184"/> he intends to go no further; and instead of a Companion, let him have alwayes such Books as may fitly accord with his travels, which he may carry without danger.</P>
<P>Let him also when he comes to any City, enquire for the best Inne, es∣pecially in <HI>Germany,</HI> and also at right in <HI>Italy,</HI> for he may take a short Dinner at any Inne in <HI>Italy,</HI> so he lodge safe at night. In all Innes, especially in suspected places, let him bolt or lock his Chamber-door; let him take heed of his Chamber∣fellow; and let him have alwayes his Sword by his side, or his Bed∣side; let him lay his Purse under his Pillow, but alwayes folded with Gar∣ters, or something he first useth in the morning.</P>
<P N="7">7. Before he takes any journey, if it be in the morning, let him eat a small Breakfast, that ill smells may not offend him; and let him dine sparingly, lest his after-noons motion hinder his digestion; but let him sup freely. The season of the year and nature of the Clime is to be re∣spected <PB N="350" REF="185"/> in Diet; in cold Regions let him take hot comfortable things; and in Summer and hot Regions, let him take such things as will cool the Blood; it is dangerous to drink when his Body is heated, unless he first make water and wash his mouth; and when he is heated, let him not suddenly expose himself to cold. In the Inne let him have a care to dry his Feet or his Neck if he be wet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and it is not amiss if he hath the skill.</P>
<P N="7">7. Likewise I advise a Traveller to be so wary whereever he comes, not to venture on any new thing, till the example of another give him confi∣dence. Let him reprove nothing in another Mans House, much less in a Commonwealth; in which kind it is not amiss to seem dumb, or tongue∣ty'd, so he diligently imploy his Eyes and Ears to observe all profita∣ble things. Let him be courteous to all, especially to his Hoste, the Children, and his fellow-so journers in the House; but in all actions let baseness be shunned, and decency <PB N="351" REF="185"/> embraced: If he apply himself to the custome of those amongst whom he lives, he shall gain their loves. And as he ought to be humble with decency, and without baseness, so in <HI>Germany</HI> he shall do well to seem, though not to be proud, where they will take a Man to be of base condi∣tion, if he be too courteous and of∣ficious.</P>
<P N="8">8. And as a Traveller ought to have a slow tongue, and his mind locked up, so let him have a clear and chearfull countenance; let him speak sparingly, and seldom speak of his own Commonwealth, or private Estate, or good qualities; and let him take this for a general Rule, that nothing doth more preserve a Traveller out of dangers, or sooner deliver him in danger, than a mode∣rate and discreet use of his tongue; let him shun a talkative companion, or not seem to hear their questions; let him not enquire after the secrets of Religion, nor desire to be present at those Rites. Also I advise a Tra∣veller to avoid all combats or single
<PB N="352" REF="186"/> Duels, especially in <HI>Italy;</HI> but if it be so that he must needs adventure his Body, let him provide means be∣fore-hand how to escape after victo∣ry.</P>
<P N="9">9. To conclude, these things are very requisite in a Traveller; the Eye of a Hawk, (to see afar off) the Ears of an Ass, (to hear the least whispering) the Face of an Ape, (to be ready to laugh in soothing) the Mouth of a Hog, (to eat what∣ever is set before him) the Back of a Camel, (to bear burthens patiently) the Leg of a Hart, (to fly from all dangers) and a full Purse, to defray all charges liberally.</P>
