<P>FOr as moche as the Lande ouer the see / that is to say the holy lande that men call the lande of hetynge / amonge all other landes it is mooste worthy lande and soueraigne of other landes / and it is blessyd and halowed and sacred of the precious blode of oure lorde iesu cryst. In the whyche lande it lyked hym to take flesshe and blode of the virgyn mary / and to en∣uiron that lande with his owne fete. And there he Wold do many myracles / and preche and teche the feythe / and the lawe of vs cristen men as vnto his childre. And ther fore he wolde suffre many reproues and scornes for vs. And he that was kynge of heuen / and of erthe / of eyre / of see / &amp; of all thynges that are conteyned in them wolde all oonly be callyd kynge of that lande whan he sayde.
