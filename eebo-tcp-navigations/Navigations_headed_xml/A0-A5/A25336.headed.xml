<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE Late Action and Defeat, IN <HI>Waterford-Bay, in Ireland.</HI> By Three of Their Majesties Men of War.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">AS ALSO, Of their Taking a <HI>French</HI> Ship of 70 Tuns, in the River; and of their Landing Men, near <HI>Dungannon;</HI> and of their releasing several Protestant Prisoners.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">WITH A large and full Account of the State of King <HI>James's</HI> Affairs in <HI>Dublin,</HI> And his late Proclamation about Protestant Churches.</HEAD>
<P>A Vessel arrived at <HI>Milford,</HI> on <HI>Saturday</HI> last, the Master whereof brings this following Account: That Three of Their Ma∣jesties Men of War, the <HI>Dover,</HI> St. <HI>Alban</HI>'s, and the <HI>Experiment,</HI> with Tenders, steering their Course for the Bay of <HI>Waterford,</HI> having a fair Wind that came up with it; and after a small time, they put Sixty chosen resolute Men on Shoar, within a Mile of a small place called <HI>Horkter,</HI> which had Fifty Soldiers in it; which on the Lan∣ding of our Men, (it being a Place of no Strength,) they immediately fled to <HI>Waterford:</HI> After which, our Men return'd to their Ships, bringing off with them, besides a great Booty, several Protestants: Our Men verily believed, that had they had but Five Hundred Men, they could at that Juncture ea∣sily have surpriz'd and taken the strong Fort of <HI>Dungannon.</HI> We could not descry the appearance of any Parties, either of the Garrison of <HI>Waterford,</HI> or <HI>Dungannon,</HI> 'till some time after our Men were abroad again, they suppo∣sing, as we imagine, that we had some
<PB REF="2"/>considerable Force to Land. At our putting to Sea again, we took a <HI>French</HI> Ship of Seventy Tuns, Laden with Brandy and Salt; she was just steer∣ing for <HI>Waterford.</HI></P>
<P>On <HI>Saturday</HI> last passed through <HI>Chester,</HI> for <HI>London,</HI> two Gentlemen, who lately made their escape from <HI>Dublin;</HI> by whom, among other Re∣lations, we have it confirmed, that Three Regiments of <HI>French</HI> marched into <HI>Dublin;</HI> upon whose arrival, King <HI>JAMES</HI> ordered Coll. <HI>Dar∣rington,</HI> and Coll. <HI>Fitz-James,</HI> to march their Regiments towards <HI>Droghedagh,</HI> and to deliver their Posts to the <HI>French;</HI> which so alarm'd the Chief of the <HI>Irish,</HI> that after a short Consultation amongst the Principal of their Officers, it was agreed, That <HI>Darrington,</HI> accompa∣nied with some others, should wait upon the Late KING, to know, if by this His Majesty's Orders, it was intended the <HI>French</HI> should have the Guard of his Person: Which, after some small time of <HI>Cabinet-Consultation,</HI> The KING declared it to be His Pleasure: Which Words so surprized and incensed <HI>Darrington</HI> and his Party, that immediately himself, Col∣lonel <HI>Baker,</HI> and about Twelve other Chief Officers went to the KING, and delivered up their Commissions; telling him withal, that many more resol∣ved to do the like. The Procee∣dings starttled the Late KING and his Council; and put them on t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Medicum,</HI> to prevent the evil Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦quences of disobliging either Faction That the Oldest Battalion of <HI>Ir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> Guards should keep their Place, as b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦fore, and that a Battalion of <HI>Fren<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> should join with them. But this D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦cision pleased neither Party; and som<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> high words happened, even almost <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> blows, though <HI>Tyrconnel</HI> did not Pu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦lickly appear in these Disturbance neither was he imprisoned as has bee said.</P>
<P>King <HI>James,</HI> to sooth up the Prote¦stants in order to put a new face on h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Proceedings, hath lately issued forth <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Proclamation, commanding many <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Churches in <HI>Dublin</HI> to be restore<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> again: According to which, Dr. <HI>Li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>¦bourn</HI> Dean of St. <HI>Patricks</HI> ascending his Pulpit to Preach, was pulled down by the Priests, and his Vestments tor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from his Back: On which, Complain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being made to King <HI>JAMES,</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> principal Rioters received a slight Re∣primand: But the Doctor attempting to Preach the <HI>Sunday</HI> following, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> treated with the like, or rather wors<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Barbarity, and the Authors vindicate<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Actions to King <HI>JAMES;</HI> and declared, That if in the least he coun∣tenanced, or pretended to Counte∣nance Heresie in the Nation, he could never expect a Blessing on his Army neither could or would adhere to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Interest.</HI></P>
