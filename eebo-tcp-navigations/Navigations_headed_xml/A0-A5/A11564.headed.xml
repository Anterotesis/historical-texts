<P>In the mornynge one houre before the breake of the daye dyd ryse greate and horryble earth quakes: for there happened seuen in the space of an h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure, &amp; I with me two fellowes were al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thre in slepe in the bedde, in an ynne of the suburbes, neare to the gates, whi¦che was a great fortune fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s that we were not closed in.</P>

<PB REF="3"/> to cleue in sunder, and the chyme∣ney with the thacke to fall, so that we dyd flye contynently, &amp; howe we eska∣ped can not I tell: yet throughe the helpe of God, dyd we eskape withoute hurte or harme of oure bodyes. But within the cytie are nearehande sonke and broken all the houses, and some folke peryshed. The churches &amp; greate howses are all fallen to the grounde. The people that was lefte in lyfe dyd crye Misericorde with greate chatte∣rynge of tethe, by reason of the feare, and ranne out of the citie into a moras grounde, where we were fledde also with oure ooste and his housholde.</P>
<P>Helas for pitie, there was so pytiefull an outcrye and howlynge of men and women, as I neuer dyd heare all the dayes of my lyfe. Muche people dyd lye besyde the stones and timber, which coulde not be holpe for feare: whether some dyd ronne to them, that can not I
<PB REF="4"/> tell: For I can not fully wryte vnto you of the horrible punishment and ad¦uertisement of God.</P>
<P>Farthermore dyd there ryse at the same houre yet .vj. earthquakes more the one after the other, whiche were so horryble at the fyrst, that the earth dyd so shake, as though it wolde haue ope∣ned it selfe, and swalowed vs all. It was so calme wether, that one leafe of the trees dyd not moue. The skye was so darck and black, that I for my part dyd wayte for the clerynge therof euery twynckelynge of an eye. Summa eue∣ry thynge was muche more, and more horrible, than I can euer describe vnto you. Neuerthelesse God gaue grace, that the darckenesse voyded, and the daye came agayne, the wynde began also to blowe agayne: wherfore we were glad and lauded and thanked God, which had so gracyously shewed his mercy to vs.</P>
<PB REF="4" MS="y"/>
<P>After that dyd we ryde to Florence, our Lorde be mercyfull vnto vs: for I beleue surelye that I haue in dede sene an example of the domes daye. The town hath yet left foure hundreth and twenty heerthes or places for fyre.</P>
<P>Good Lord what a pitieful cryenge and callynge vppon God was herde there. To burne a towne is not to be compared by this dolorous chaunce. God our Lorde graunte vnto vs all his mercy, that we maye by this earth∣quake amende and conuerte vs to his glory, and oure soules health. Amen.</P>
<P>Lyke earthquakes haue ben at Florence, and in all those countryes, but they haue not done so great hurtes saue onely that they haue ouerthrowen many chymenies. This haue I written vnto you in hayste, bycause the Post coulde not tarye.</P>

<P>IN Turky (as I vnderstande) is a cytie sonke into the grounde, out of the whiche is not one man escaped.</P>
