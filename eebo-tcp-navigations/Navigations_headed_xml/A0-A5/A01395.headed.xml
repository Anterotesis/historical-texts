<P>Right Honourable,</P>

with equall distribution as the mastring curbs of all humane endeauours: with such like. So should we erect the frame of our actions vpon the foundation of preuailing effects, and not at∣tempt any thing without a speciall limitation. For euen little children, that sport in the aire at randome can say, they meant to exercise themselues, or in emulation to shoot higher then their fellowes. This inciteth me (right Honorable) to anticipate their calumniation, or derision, that shall startle me with these que∣stions, why I presumed like a seeled doue to flie at randome with such disguises, and amongst all others firmed my selfe on the sun-shining beautie of your house. I answere both with the same truth and plainesse, that detruded me be∣tweene the streights of censuring imperfections: Besides the manifest reasons inserted in the Title and Preface, An honest fame, and per∣aduenture orderly profit to maintaine a poore liberty of life, and keepe vertue vnspotted

from the filthinesse of corruption, were the markes of my aime. But concerning your Ho∣nour, an earnest desire to prostrate my endea∣uours before you, and a meere presaging confi∣dence, that with vndefiled vowes you will cha∣rily preserue the loue of our Countrey, impulsed this insinuation, and extended the Argument thus farre; that as it hath pleased his Maiesty to ouermantle you with fauour, and support you with greatnesse (wherein Princes make their vertues truly eminent, and worthily ex∣alted) so you will remember, that the good ser∣uant augmented his tallent; and he liues not at all, who liues onely to himselfe. Therefore Great Lord let me I pray you behold you like a faire moouing Planet in a sufficient Orbe, from whose influence can proceede nothing but sweete presages, and if there be any thing in these triuiall discourses, that may boast of your acceptation, and noble construction, make me the prouder, because I come so simply naked

without palpable flattery, or cunning display∣ing your Fame and merit. Besides, howeuer I am so great a stranger, that not so much as the sound of my name hath passed by your eares, so low a shrubbe, that I stand at a stay, and keepe my owne greennes, and so ruinous a wall, that euen bosome friends haue started away for feare of falling vpon them: I must be yet con∣tented, and hope, you will not search me so narrowly as vpon the discouerie of my imper∣fections to pretend my contempt, nor dismisse me vilipended, when all the world hath pro∣claimed your worth. In which assurance I thus cast my selfe into the open mouth of the Mon∣ster of the world, <HI>Opinion:</HI> and presume to be preserued by the <HI>Antidote</HI> of your Patro∣nage from any dangerous infection, or Lethal ruine.</P>

<HEAD>The Preface.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Nec Adulatori. Nec Detractori.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Lthough there is no end of writing books (as saies the Preacher) and the vexati∣on of our very soules ariseth from the desire of knowledge, especially when we steppe a little into vaine-glory, the last thing laide away of the wisest men: yet either custome, or some particular purposes doe still traduce many in this kinde, who otherwise walked with sufficient reputation, and like the foole in the <HI>Prouerbes</HI> might haue beene counted wise, if they had held their peace. So that it cannot chuse, but I must incurre the like imputation, yea peraduenture ridiculous contempt; when I haue nothing to say, but for the glory of my Countrey, and seeme to maintaine a Position, which few English∣men deny, and that I doe herein no more, then the <HI>Swizer</HI> or <HI>Sauoian,</HI> who preferreth his snowy hils, before the beau∣ty <NOTE PLACE="marg">All nations loue their owne Coun∣trey best.</NOTE> of <HI>Lombardy,</HI> and rageth in his disceptation, if you ei∣ther vilipend his barren Mountaines and dangerous pas∣sages, or preferre any other glorious nation before him. But againe, when I striue to mount a little higher, and tune out this harmony to a reach of excellency, and pre∣rogatiue
<PB REF="5"/>
ouer all kingdomes, and people in such things, wherein God doth blesse any Nation, you now would a little procrastinate my iourney, and cannot but suppose me ouer-liberall and ouer-partiall in my iudgement, espe∣cially, if 1. either you are a stranger: 2. Or haue beene a Traueller: 3. Or looke no further, then on the bescar∣red and deformed face of antiquity as Authours haue wounded the same: 4. Or liue discontented through par∣ticular greeuances in your Countrey: 5. Or are wilfull and irregular by the impostures of superstition: 6. Or affrighted at the power and greatnesse of other Princes: 7. Or transported with a poore opinion of our wealth: 8. Or to conclude, are meerely ignorant, and vnderstand no more, then is conferred vpon you by relation of o∣thers: wherein you must needes resemble certaine empty trunkes in Court remoues, who onely fill vp a place: but vnderstand not, wherefore, nor by whom they are im∣ploied: yet because I would also satisfie these, and corro∣borate my Hypothesis with probable reason, I will lead them by the hand into the faire fields of this discouerie, and neuer desist, vntill they are conduced to safe harbour, and there Eccho out the truth in security; though it seeme a Panegyricall applause, and carry a phantasticall burthen of flattery. Onely the methode I would vse is somewhat intricate, and the desire I haue to shunne confusion, will make a greater confusion like a true and modest Louer, who fearing to disclose her affection by her lookes, doth in that restraint make the next looke more passionate.</P>
<P>But to the purpose. If you be a stranger, which you <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Strangers.</NOTE> may be either by ignorance, or nation: then peraduenture you looke no further, then what you see, or know, and not vnderstanding the honourable secret of our Countrey,
<PB REF="5"/>
suppose nothing comparable to the ostentous brauery of some few stones, and dead things of those Cities, where∣in you are reziant: but TACITVS, and other famous Authors can tell you, that Cities are not glorious with emptie houses, and lime and stone compacted for show, and subiect to ruine and breuiary demolition; but in the wisedome, wealth, and resplendant eminence of noble Citizens, and well ordered men: so that no man, vnac∣quainted with the secrets of a Kingdome, can compara∣tiuely subiect it either to vilipending, or insufficiency.</P>
<P>If you are a Traueller? Then carried away with present shadowes, or transported with a cursory vanity of some <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Traueller.</NOTE> stately edifices, braue Curtezans, entertainement of stran∣gers (recommended by some speciall Councellour of State) strong castles, new ramparts, conuenient harbours, well furnished Arsenalls, some prety gallies, and hearke∣ning after euery report to please the Hearing, or rauished with some comicke sight to moue admiration, you go no further, then present contentment, nor will once remem∣ber, what a mother you haue of your owne, and how a le∣gitimate childe ought to be louing, dutifull, and aduised. <NOTE PLACE="marg">3 B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>e∣reader:</NOTE></P>
<P>If you search for no better secrets, then what absolute Authors haue locked vp in their storehouses, who many times filled their papers with extraneall reports, and when they were possessed with a nouelty exciting astonishment, they then enlarged the same, setting downe euery thing as authenticall, which onely carried the show of probabi∣lity by some enforcing circumstances, howeuer it sauour∣ed of detraction, and calumny: Thus I confesse haue ma∣ny written of BRITANY, as of a strange and barbarous nation, naked people, painted, enraged, liuing vpon roots and herbes, eating raw flesh, and remote from the brauery
<PB REF="6"/>
of populous Cities, and courtly pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>aces: whereby a con∣tinued impression is so made, and lest to posteritie, that in many places they suppose the same still. Wherein I can∣not compare them better, then to some poore Farmer, who liuing in an old cottage, thatcht, and deformed, is compelled at last to go into another Countrey, as dispos∣sessed by some wealthy Lawyer, or Citizen, and so rela∣teth to his new acquaintance, what a pittifull house hee came from, and how miserable hee left the same, little knowing, how delicately, yea stately it is reedified, and holdeth vp such a contrary face of Maiesty, that if he were to returne, and view it againe, he could not imagine it the same, nor that any policy of man, or worldly meanes had contriued the alteration.</P>
<P>If you liue discontented at home, then out of a sullen and dogged humour you spare not any accusation of your <NOTE PLACE="marg">4 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>me-bred discontents</NOTE> countrey, whether for deficiency of blessings, or gouern∣ment; but hearken after euery report of strangers, and are contented to be cosoned with the deceit of forraine relations, and so from a wilfull neglect of our worthines, wilt neither beleeue the maiesty of our honour, the mag∣nificense of our structures, the variety of our happinesse, the decency of our Cities, the exaltation of officers, the beauty of women, the glory of conuersation, and all o∣ther particulars tending to an absolute demonstration of our worth: but dost vnkindly weigh it downe with com∣parison, saying there are some slender commendable things amongst vs, but farre inferiour to other nations.</P>
<P>If you are superstitious, or would seeme affectionate to religion, then vnder a pious show of deuotion, you abso∣lutely <NOTE PLACE="marg">5 Patisis.</NOTE> condemne all other things, and sweare they are vn∣ualuable to the pacification of the conscience, and setling
<PB REF="6"/>
the soule to peace, and vnderstanding the way to saluati∣on; and so without either desire, or endeauours to enter∣taine a further truth, you not onely deny those allegati∣ons which may diuert you from falshood, but are an ad∣uersarie to all commemorations of temporall matters, which may giue you light to conduct you to the acquain∣tance of ENGLANDS merit, and high exalted desert.</P>
<P>If you are terrified with the strength and warlike prepa∣ration of forraine Princes, because you heare of well for∣tified <NOTE PLACE="marg">6 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> places, armies on foote, treasure amassed, shippes rigged, Countries subiugated, garisons dispersed, Princes affied, and the Pope blessing them. Then peraduenture you may suppose, that we cannot propulse such aduersa∣ries, nor haue sufficient meanes to rebate the insolencie of so high exalted Monarchs; because you are either faithlesse in heart, traiterous in loialty, simple in apprehen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ion, of ouer-reached by cunning inferences of others, and so re∣maine confounded at some common wants amongst vs, disabling all things, which may tend to strengthen the hopes and loue to your owne Countrey.</P>
<P>If you are desirous of wealth, and corrupted with the <NOTE PLACE="marg">7 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/></NOTE> filthinesse of lucre, then it may be hearing of the infinite treasures of the GRAN SIGNIEVR, the Venetian riches, the many millions comming out of India into Spaine, so many crownes of the sunne coined in France, and the an∣nuall entradoes of diuers Countries, and Principates, and troubled at home with strange rumours of penuries and wants, with exportation of our gold and coine into for∣raine parts, and some forcible convulsions of priuate men to enrich themselues: you are amazed, and cannot be set∣led with any opinion of our sufficiency, and will scarce be helped with better information.

uide possessions by way of contribution to their children; reward their seruants, and endeauour to bee neere the Prince? would you dispute of ciuill conuersation, of a Land that floweth with milke and hony, of eating vnder thy owne vineyard, of receiuing the temporall blessings of encrease, of solemnities at feasts, of burials and mour∣nings for the dead, of martiall exequies, of triumphant marriages, and priuate reioycings, of honest and friendly visitations, of mutuall commerces, of powerfull presents? of detaining vs within the limits of naturall obseruation, as <HI>quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris,</HI> and in truth of all fundamentall principles of gouernment in the hands of the Scriptures is lifted vp a mirror to looke into without specke, staine, base composure, or counterfeit foile.</P>
<P>Would you haue directions for maintaining a magistra∣cie, for adapting you to reciprocall duties of releeuing the poore, succouring the fatherlesse and widowes, suppres∣sing the proud, restraining the offensiue, imparting of fa∣uours, acknowledging of friendlinesse, with such like? would you be thankefull when your cuppe doth ouer∣flow, reposed when necessities knocke at the doore, pa∣tient when aduersitie deiecteth, moderate when prosperi∣ty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>lateth, free from repining at the glory of thine aduer∣sary, sparing insulting ouer the misery of inferiours, and remember, who is the distributer of all good gifts, like the Master of a Comedy, who sorteth out his Sceanes ac∣cording to the inclination of his schollers, making a poore mans childe to personate a Prince, and the sonne of a lord to acte a meaner part? In the Scriptures shineth the light of such vnderstanding, and liueth the soule, and life of the truest wisedome.</P>
<P>In a word, would you know the duty to God and man,

<P>IF you suppose <HI>Herodatus</HI> an Author meriting the fame, and good opinion disposed toward him: in his fourth booke you shall finde him ouermantling <HI>Scithia</HI> from the denomination of <HI>Scythe</HI> the sonne of <HI>Hercules,</HI> with his brethren <HI>Gelo,</HI> and <HI>Agathirsis,</HI> and by a woman with much adoe beleeued to be halfe a snake: but it may be the allu∣sion from the cruell condition of the people extracted <NOTE PLACE="marg">Amazones.</NOTE> from this linage, gaue way to the fiction. For after <HI>Aga∣thirsis</HI> had taught the Inhabitants the vse of bow and ar∣rowes, they became so expert in shooting, that from hunting and killing of beasts, they set vpon men and strangers, yea at last grew barbarous toward one another: so that the admirable report of the <HI>Amasons</HI> a principall Nation amongst them, is now esteemed a matter of pro∣babilitie, who remembring their vowes to <HI>Diana,</HI> and cu∣stomes of their <HI>Herculian</HI> Progenitors, accustomed to cut off their right pappes for the better dexterity of this mili∣tary exercise, and so their famous exploits made all the Countrey reuerence the Goddesse for their sakes, in whose memory they performed actions beyond credit, and for whose reuerence <HI>Thoas</HI> beganne an <HI>Holocaust</HI> of strangers, as by the story of <HI>Iphigenia Agamemnons</HI> daughter may appeare: so that they continued in glorious estimation, till <HI>Tomyr is</HI> conquered <HI>Cyrus,</HI> and taught all mighty Mo∣narchs and Tyrants this lesson, that the punishment of sinnes is a iudgement from heauen, and when they are in

as <HI>Othoman, Barka, Allau, Tamberlaine</HI> and others, whose noble exploits made Fame flie about the world to divulge how glorious valour and vertue was in some worthy spi∣rits ouer others. But amongst many hundreds, none ob∣tained so much at the hands of history and report, as <HI>Barka</HI> and <HI>Allau</HI> both named Emperors at one time. For when many battailes had filled the fieldes with the car∣kasses of as many thousands, the people weary of such slaughters, and they themselues amazed at the crueltie, it was concluded betweene them to diuide the Empire, hauing indeed a world of ground to satisfie ten Emperors: but some Authors are willing to maintaine, that they scorned such partition, and so in a noble combat deci∣ded the controuersie themselues, till the Controuler of men and kingdomes made <HI>Barka</HI> triumphant, who in the next lustrum of his gouernment had by the beautifull <HI>Tar∣tara</HI> a sonne for his mothers sake named the Author of Peace, and proclaimed besides <HI>Barka Tartarus:</HI> so that when he leauing three sonnes behinde him, gaue them al∣so leaue to diuide the Empire.

For although the <HI>Tartar Chrim</HI> would faine challenge affinitie with the <HI>Turke,</HI> expecting if the line of <HI>Othoman</HI> should faile the greatest share of the worlds magnificence: yet without question it is but a couert presumption, and the fanaticall hopes of some imposturing prediction: Otherwise hee dare not but acknowledge the Emperor <HI>Cham</HI> for his su∣preame; and is affrighted, when he heares of any com∣plaints

to his preiudice: As for his further enlarging his credit, because <HI>Tamberlaine</HI> was extracted from him, who conquered <HI>Persia, Asia minor,</HI> and <HI>Baiazet,</HI> it will stand him in litle stead to startle from his first obedience, as I said before, and helpe him as litle to intrude into <HI>Turkie.</HI> for all he diuulgeth, that the sonnes of <HI>Tamberlaine</HI> brought with them the daughters of the <HI>Persian Sophy,</HI> and <HI>Othoman</HI> familie into <HI>Tartary,</HI> from whence he is now li∣neally descended. But some will haue it thus, that <HI>Barka</HI> in remembrance of the horrible confusion of the warres, named his sonne <HI>Tartarus,</HI> as a very deciphering of Hell, and that the people should be euer after affrighted at dis∣sensions by recording the mischiefe formerly acted. But to proceede:</P>
<P>From <HI>Scithia</HI> to the prouince of <HI>Tangut</HI> they liue in troopes called <HI>Hordas,</HI> and remoue from place to place ac∣cording to the temperature of the season, plenty of feed∣ing, and conueniencie of accommodating one another: nor before the yeere of Redemption 1212 (as I said) did we in <HI>Europe</HI> heare of the name of a <HI>Tartar:</HI> but <HI>Scithians, Sarmatians, Albanians,</HI> and such like, who were all idola∣ters, worshipping their gods in trees, hanging vp their dead on nether boughes, and by way of auguring diuining their happines or damnation, which custome is still retei∣ned amongst the barbarous sort in the remotest places. They are generally men of square stature, broad faces, hollow eyes, thin beards, owgly countenances, and tye vp their haire to the crowne of their heads in rolles, like a Snailes shell; to which you may adde swarthnes of com∣plexion, not that the Sunne kisseth them with that feruen∣cie, but the aire and their sluttish customes corrupts both their blood and bodies: yet hath nature preuailed ouer
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
these outward inconueniences in the distribution of va∣lour, swiftness of footmanship, vigilancie, and patience to endure the many encombrances of trauell, hunger, and want of sleepe. They loue Horses, and from that loue accustome themselues to a sauage drinking of their blood, practising a cunning theft herein, which being vnpunisha∣ble, occasioneth many prety changes, both in keeping their owne, and purloyning from others, as if some ciuill Artist had instructed them with the Lacedemonian tole∣ration <NOTE PLACE="marg">Theft law∣full, and vn∣lawfull.</NOTE> in this kinde, for the better animating one another in the spoyling their enemies: yet for all this, by reason they liue in tents, and haue small defences for their furni∣ture and goods, theft of petty things is seuerely punished amongst them, as also adulterie, or if you will lying with another mans wife, which is most odious vnto them, be∣cause they are tyed to the trusting of one another, as I said within dores, and no man is debarred any enter∣course: it were therefore a double treachery to deceiue the trust reposed, and either purloyne the goods which lye open, or abuse the women which admit you so friendly. They are gouerned in their trauels and remo∣uings by the starres, and obseruing the North pole settle according to her influence: They liue free from coue∣tousnes, and are thus farre happy, that the strange corrup∣tions of wealth, especially gold and siluer breed no disor∣ders amongst them: yet haue they a kinde of trafficke, and by way of exchange continue mutuall commerces, louing presents, and can be contented to be flattered euen in their barbarisme: and herein I thinke all the Easterne people are delighted, from a receiued tradition of our Patriarkes. But howsoeuer, I can assure you <HI>Tartar Chrim</HI> himselfe, who is the most likeliest to be spoken with of all

others, as being the neerest, will not admit of any Chri∣stian without a gratuitie, and present worthy of his fauour.</P>
<P>You must now step a litle forward toward the East, and with the Sunnes rising see their glory arise: For <HI>Tan∣gut</HI> is a wealthy Prouince, affording many things befitting <HI>Europes</HI> magnificence, especially <HI>Rheubarb,</HI> a simple of <NOTE PLACE="marg">R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>barb.</NOTE> that prerogatiue, as if the whole world were beholding for this distribution, and had a sauing health by vertue of the same. In <HI>Cathaia</HI> amongst many others, the great Citie of <HI>Cambala</HI> will excite admiration, if you measure a quadrant of 30 mile about, and ouer-looke at euery cor∣ner a Tower 40 furlongs in circuit, erected for a <HI>Seralia</HI> or <HI>Arsenall,</HI> wherein the Emperors munition, armour, and prouision for war are secured: but he himself is sequestred to the priuacie of another stately Pallace, and is a strange <HI>Meteor</HI> amongst them seldome seene, but for some porten∣tous accident. In <HI>Mangia</HI> as Queene of the rest, is the Citie of <HI>Quinzai,</HI> hauing a circumference of a 100 mile, by reason a great Lake of 30 mile diuideth the streets into channels, ouer which are numbred 1260 bridges, some opening the arches so high and wide, that a good ship vnder saile hath a passage of ease, but things a farre off are quickly reported; yet hardly beleeued, and some∣times ouer-beleeued vpon easie report, as you may per∣ceiue by the trauels of <HI>S<SUP>r</SUP> Iohn Mandeuile,</HI> the writings of <HI>Munster,</HI> and the constant asseueration of moderne Pilgrims, who all tell of so many monstrous shapes of men in these parts, that our ciuill people are affrighted at the hearing, and many times come flocking to see such Trauellers, as haue escaped the dangerous passages, and sauage immanitie. For my owne part I would per∣swade
<PB N="9" REF="14"/>
you, that the world is a stage of variety and won∣ders, whereon are placed more strange things of truth, then the wit and policie of man can invent to seeme fabu∣lous: but as at a stage the spectators onely are a few in number to the infinite multitudes for the time excluded; so in the exploration of Countries not one amongst ten thousand either take the paines, or haue the iudgement to looke into the wonders of the world, and therefore I would be loth to exclude all enlargements of histories from the closet of truth: yet concerning those fabulous reports of Pigmies and Cranes, of men with long eares, one eye, one foote, and such like, the Iudicious take vp the bookes to read, as if they would excite laughter; and I dare be bold to maintaine, there are no such men or people in the world: but all Gods images are miraculous in this distinction of voice, reason, and an erected counte∣nance, with a proportion of shape, and what is not thus established, is meerely a monster, or a beast. But because I am sure, whether true or false, there is nothing amongst them worthy respect, or challenging any prerogatiue of happinesse, or imitation, I will leaue them to their vast territories, and desist from amasing you with the almost incredible particulars of those places, especially <HI>Cathaia,</HI> and <HI>Mangia.</HI></P>

For hee is carried in great pomp on the shoulders of men, adorned with purple, golde, and preci∣ous stones, the chaire hanging with orient pearle, and all thing so ordered, as if the best of our ceremonies should adde an honor to Maiesty. His Guards for his person are many and the best of his souldiers, who suffer no neerer approaches to his stately throne, then hee himselfe shall command, which is publikely knowen by the disrobing of his head of common ornaments, and inuesting himselfe with a magnificent Diadem, then are Embassadors admit∣ted, and diuers lawes enacted for the good of the people.</P>
<P>Another booke will discouer, that when hee disposeth himselfe to pleasure, his concubines are sent for to be par∣takers of the hunting, and then in open view the beasts are killed, being chased before hand into certaine straight en∣closures for the purpose: but if he determine a longer pro∣gresse, their chariots are drawne with Elephants, and their <NOTE PLACE="marg">Diuers au∣thours write of <HI>India,</HI> and would in∣clude <HI>China</HI> as one Coun∣trey</NOTE> honourable Queenes left at home: but the wantons are enstructed to make proud incontinency swell with varie∣ty, not accustoming their wiues to be partaker of such la∣sciuious changes, but reseruing them for necessity of chil∣dren, or moderation of contentment: when he determi∣neth to sleepe, or peraduenture is ouerloded with wine, that he must resettle his spirits and senses with rest and

<P>Another will relate, how worthily their honest matrons liue after they haue had children, how euer they yeelde their chastities at the first to their louers for the price of an Elephant, which yet neuer exciteth any exprobation a∣gainst them. In some places, when a virgin desireth mar∣riage, her parents bring her to publike view amongst a number of young men, where shee electeth whom shee fancieth. In their mutuall commerces they hate vsury, dis∣claime iniustice, denie indentures of couenant, contracts of writing, and haue many seeming excellencies of loue, confidence, and trusting one another: onely they are im∣patient of wrong, and thinke it a glory to take reuenge, but will not offer the occasion.</P>
<P>Another will tell you, that they once esteemed two sorts of wisemen, by the names of <HI>Samaraei</HI> and <HI>Bracha∣manes,</HI> both which were charactered for <HI>Gymnosophists:</HI> but the <HI>Samaraei</HI> for their precisenesse were better estee∣med of the Kings; for liuing more moderate then the rest, as eating neither fish nor flesh, it added to their repu∣tation, that the peace of their Kingdomes was established by their <HI>orizons,</HI> and the prosperity of the countrey con∣firmed through their holinesse.</P>
<P>Another will demonstrate, how S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Thomas</HI> conuerted them to Christianity, how euer with the Syrians in <HI>Sama∣ria,</HI> they haue since intermingled horrible idolatry, and vntill the Portugals came amongst them, would scarse re∣forme the most grossest abuses.</P>
<P>Another will enlarge the conquest of their countrey by the Portugals and Spanyard, with a full description of all things, which may shew you the perfect portraiture of
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
their kingdomes, courts, common-wealth, riches, plea∣sures, ciuill administration, and mightinesse: yet (as I take it) so farre from a conquest, as wee were ouer <HI>France,</HI> when we had only <HI>Callis</HI> in <HI>Picardy,</HI> or <HI>Turwin</HI> and <HI>Tornay,</HI> which cost more the re-edifying, then all the country about it was worth. Heere you shall also finde how they haue striued with the Aegyptians for antiquity and cunning, how many Ilands are subiected vnto them, amongst whom <HI>Summatra,</HI> in times past called <HI>Taprobana,</HI> mustreth the power of eight Kings. <HI>Iapan</HI> affoordeth our English a harbour; and at <HI>Bantam</HI> they receiue the commodities of <HI>China</HI> from the Indian Marchants, who are only admitted to commerce amongst them: and diuers others, as are therein variated with many particulars.</P>
<P>To conclude no one Countrey comes neere it for great∣nesse, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>India</HI> now intermin∣gled with Christians.</NOTE> which without other addition lifteth vp her title a∣lone, as challenging all the territories betweene <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Persia;</HI> yea in times past <HI>China</HI> it selfe, almost 1200.

Yet hath this idolatrous superstition acknowledgement of a God, whom they in∣uest with a triple crowne, not yeelding any reason for the same, but that he commandeth Heauen, Earth, and Hell. The Iesuites haue taught them to baptize infants in some places, and to fast, wherein they are now tedious obser∣uants (as barbarous people are best maintainers of cu∣stomes and ceremonies) and they vse the signe of the crosse, but it is where they are enforced by the Spanish ga∣risons,
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>
otherwise, what I spake before of <HI>China:</HI> for all their silkes, clothes of gold, delicate beds, houses of canes, Serpents, Elephants, precious stones, minerals, pearles, perfumes, drugs, spice, sweet wood, barkes of trees, shels, nuts, and other things of estimation, I may with a Christi∣nn-like sorrow amplifie, concerning their turpitude and morosity. As for their cities, euery one would affoord a story, and I am vnwilling to runne into the errour of ficti∣on or miracle, considering your best Cosmographers haue onely extended the relations of others, and besides the va∣riety of contradicting one another, would now be amazed to see so bewtifull a face of many countries, which they left most glorious, so deformed: and so vnpleasant a coun∣tenance, as they imagined, so illustrious and exalted.</P>
<P>And thus much for that part of <HI>Asia,</HI> who are all Idola∣ters, barbarous, inhumane, treacherous, haters of strangers, and so remote from the happinesse I would relie vpon, as my ioy exceedeth for not being a natiue amongst them.</P>

That infinite Ilands full of drugges, mineralls, gold, pretious stones, pearle, spice, &amp;c. are the handmaides of this Mistris, especially the great Iland of Saint <HI>Laurence</HI> in times past called <HI>Madagascar,</HI> which now compareth with <HI>Britaine</HI> for magnitude, as containing 600. mile in length, but say what deuises can, ours is the greatest Iland of the world. Many other particulars are inserted by Authors with addition of their manners, and customes: but be∣cause all absolute things are worne out of date, and that it would vex a Traueller to read one thing, and finde ano∣ther, I will trouble antiquitie no longer, but content my selfe with some probabilities, and the best receiued opini∣ons of this Monarchy.</P>
<P>You must then vnderstand, that those limited Garisons of <HI>Aegipt</HI> vnder the <HI>Turke,</HI> are here very strong to keepe backe the excursions of the <HI>Aethiopians,</HI> who from <HI>Nilus</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The conuer∣sion of the Aethiopi∣ans.</NOTE> to the South-sea make one Countrey, and are all reputed Christians, boasting of their conuersion from <HI>Candauce</HI> the Queene in the <HI>Actes</HI> of the Apostles, whom by ano∣ther name they call <HI>Iudith,</HI> and so afterward submitted to the obedience of one principall, to whom they afforded the significant title of <HI>Preste Iehan,</HI> not that he is a Byshop or Priest, as some superstitiously conceiue, but that those <NOTE PLACE="marg">Prester Ie∣han no Priest.</NOTE> words signifie in the <HI>Aethiopian</HI> tongue Great PRINCE, or EMPEROR. Amongst them are many Monasteries both of men and women, but strictly prohibiting any en∣tercourse betweene them, or wanton show of prophana∣tion: their fasts are 50. daies with bread and water, and some slender fruit, as for fish they haue litle store, or lesse skill to take them, or make vse of them by way of suste∣nance: they are so carefull in the obseruation of their cu∣stomes concerning this religious fasting and prayers, that

they will sleepe no longer, then they hold their heads o∣uer water, that the nodding downe may giue them war∣ning to be more vigilant: their bells are of stone for the most part; their Priests marry, and celebrate the masse, allowing in their procession, crosses, censors, tapers, and lampes: the retired monkes maintaine their haire; the common Priests shaue, and both are b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>refoote, especially in the Church, wherein no man enters with prophanation; but putteth off his sandalls and laieth them apart, as the <HI>Turkes</HI> doe, who are very carefull in such deuout obserua∣tions, adding withall a ceremonious washing, taken from the Iewish purifying, as in his proper place shall appeare. The Sabbaoths and Eues are festiuals and celebrated ac∣cordingly; circumcision is added to their baptisme both in men and women, vnto which they are not admitted, vn∣till 40. daies, and then the three persons of the Trinity haue a reuerent exaltation, and the Eucharist is admini∣stred by custome at the same time according to the cre∣dit of the Greeke Church, which they resolutely confirme to haue priority before the Latine: their names are all significant, and the religion ariseth from a certaine booke, which they confidently maintaine was approued by the Synode of the Apostles, congregated at <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> The very common people haue plurality of wiues, according to their sufficient ability to support their estates, and con∣tent their desires, suffering diuorses either for naturall im∣perfections, or iust causes of incontinencie: but such men and women thus scandalized are debarred intermedling with spirituall matters; some say not admitted into the Church at all. Their Nobility are in great estimation, and according to actions correspondent to their professed ver∣tue preserue the wealth, and credit of their Auncestors.

Their greatest Cities are few in number, but such as stand by the sea shore are of good strength and eminence with stupendous Castels and workes of antiquity. The com∣mon heape of houses are poore, sluttish, all on the ground open, without chimnies, and sutable to the dispersed man∣ner of their villages.

The Emperors progenie hath giuen way to diuers Histories, and is now so increased in wealth, mightinesse, estimation, command ouer his Subiects, and such other tumors of Maiestie; that many stratagems, and politicall deuices haue taught one another trickes to bring the proudest Monarch on his knees: whereby sometimes his will and imperiousnesse vpon the least iealosie of competition, or incroaching on the Diadem, hath beene mixed with a kinde of tyrannie, and the Subiects obedience resembled to slauish prostitu∣tion: so that in his chiefest and best ordered Townes of <HI>Nouagrade</HI> and <HI>Mosko,</HI> many strange and fearefull executi∣ons haue beene practised, and the Subiect enforced to wil∣full murthering one another to satisfie the Emperors pleasure: as for his warres either forraine or domestique, how euer his many Countries, ostentous numbers of people, and seeming resolutions of the Souldiers, would giue an affrighting shadow from some portentous body▪ yet is he glad of auxiliary forces, and according to poli∣tike obseruations of such confused multitudes, must haue

They follow for the most part the rites and ceremonie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> of the Greeke Church, and superstitiously maintaine many idle traditions and ridiculous ceremonies: The Priests haue wiues, teach the adoration of images, fast, and compell to confession, which the common people sup∣pose most necessary, especially for the Nobles and Gen∣try, in regard of their sensuall libertie in sinne, and volup∣tuous prostitution to all manner of filthinesse, like those which were reprehended by the Prophet for sitting downe to eat and drinke, and rising vp to play. Their chiefest prayers consist on the faith of this breefe; <HI>Iesu thou sonne of God haue mercy vpon me:</HI> as for the Lords prayer they haue in small vse or forme, because the Scriptures are pro∣hibited them, and not suffred to be published; yea the Priests themselues scarse haue the New Testament a∣mongst them.

<P>Here reason and honest pitie wanne the field of former wilfulnes and resolution, and the Queene was not onely proclaimed the mother of charity, but applauded for her wisdome, and high exalted vertue: so they allowed her directions, and without further disputing the matter, ship∣ped forth 300000 soules, who dispersed themselues ouer the North-east of <HI>Europe,</HI> filling those countries, which now are called <HI>Muldauia, Bogdonia,</HI> the borderers of the blacke sea, and <HI>Russia</HI> with new names and nations, such as were afterward distinguished by <HI>Samatae, Gothae, Longa∣bardi, Hunni, Vandali, Getae, Swedi,</HI> and diuers others, who raised their fortunes out of industry, and made their able bodies the ministers of a great prosperitie: For when the Emperors of <HI>Constantinople</HI> groned vnder the burthen of diuision and dissention with the Princes of the West, and had no other way to pacifie the indignation, but by drawing maine Armies into the field; they were also compelled to entertaine these strong and barbarous peo∣ple, as presidiary, and depending on their military salary: But they quickly instructed in the discipline of Armes, and as quickly furnished for any imployment, did as

For at this houre, the sonnes of the olde Arch-Duke haue thus raised the throne of imperiousnesse: <HI>Ro∣dulphus</HI> Emperour, yet famous for nothing but peaceable desires, and a priuate sequestration scarce affecting the de∣fence of his owne territories, much lesse the expatiating of any military proiect against the enemy of Christendome. <HI>Matthias</HI> after much repining and a great expectation, King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> out of which hee hopeth (if occasion serue) to step into his brothers chaire, and command <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> or at lest so much as the <HI>Pope</HI> and King of <HI>Spaine</HI> can support him in. <HI>Maximilian,</HI> Arch-Duke of <HI>Austria,</HI> and powerfull enough in being commander of <HI>Vienna,</HI> from whence the <HI>Turks</HI> with 200000. souldiers was valiantly repulsed. <HI>Albertus,</HI> first Arch-Bishop of <HI>Toledo,</HI> then <HI>Car∣dinall,</HI> next dispensed with, and married to the <HI>Infanta</HI> of <HI>Spaine</HI> his cozen german, and last of all Arch-Duke of <HI>Bur∣gundy,</HI> and Commander of the Low-Countries, or at least so many as are brought so low, that hee standeth like a <HI>Colossus</HI> ouer them: and <HI>Ernestus</HI> called the Cardinall of <HI>Austria,</HI> but whether <HI>filius naturalis,</HI> or no, I dispute not on; so that if the father were now aliue, to see this bundle

But although the <HI>Germanes</HI> haue thus raised vp the princi∣pall tree, wherein the double neckt Eagle doth build her airy: yet is it farre from any royall florishing, or Monar∣chall supremacy. For neither is it hereditary, nor after inauguration can he commaund, as other Kings, or like the briefe of <HI>Samuels</HI> Oratory to the rebellious <HI>Israelites,</HI> shew the reciprocall duties betweene Prince and Subiect: but by no meanes is he powerfull enough to ouerthrow the priuiledges of the Empire, because the Princes be so many, so mighty, so beloued, that they attend in Court at pleasute, raise their forces at pleasure, contest with the Emperor in many cases at pleasure, and supply his wants and demands for impositions at pleasure. The Townes againe are so strong, so priuiledged, so populous, that out of obstinate finding fault with taxes and imperious re∣straints, they many times oppose against their principall lords, and in hostile manner exclude them from the bene∣fit of commaunding, like royall Princes indeed, witnesse the many contentions of <HI>Colleine</HI> with the Noble men and Byshops, and at last with the Byshop and the people, the power of the DVKE of <HI>Saxony</HI> in maintaining of LV∣THER against both Pope and Emperor: the repining of diuers Cities, and Princes, when the <HI>Lantsgraue</HI> of <HI>Hesse</HI> was imprisoned vnder <HI>Charles</HI> the 5.

<HEAD>The History of <HI>COLLEINE.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>COlleine</HI> is a famous Towne, and one principall of the <HI>Vbij</HI> before CHRIST, which questionlesse the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> <HI>Romanes</HI> made great account of as a receptacle for their garrisons, when they had warre against the <HI>Swedians,</HI> who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>nged then all ouer <HI>Germany,</HI> especially in <HI>Saxonia.</HI> In the time of <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> there was a wodden bridge made ouer the <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ene</HI> for the better transporting his armie, which was after transhap't into stone, but the miracle pro∣ceeded from the power of money, and industry of man; but because many murthers, rapes, and robberies were committed on the same, <HI>Bruno</HI> the Byshoppe by the Em∣peror <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>os</HI> commaundement ruined, and quite subuerted it: so it should seeme it was then called <HI>Vbiopolis,</HI> vntill a commutation into <HI>Colonia Agrippina</HI> of <HI>Marcus Agrippa</HI> sonne in law to <HI>Augustus Caesar,</HI> who reedified and beau∣tified the same; yet <HI>Tacitus</HI> extracteth the title from a daughter of <HI>Augustus</HI> borne here, and leaueth it as a place of great consequence vnder the iurisdiction of ma∣ny worthy Commaunders; but it should seeme, they en∣tertained Christianity betimes, and quickly cast away the authoritie of the <HI>Romanes:</HI> For thus they record it. A∣bout the yeere 70. <HI>Maternus</HI> the Disciple of Saint <HI>Peter</HI> conuerted the <HI>Vbij,</HI> who admitted their spirituall saluati∣on with such gladnesse, that they likewise determined the preseruation of their liberty and bodies, and so proiected to be free of themselues, had not afterward diuers Em∣perors, setled the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and Earles of the Em∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> established greatness both ouer Citie and Coun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>, vntill againe the Pope wrested the supremacie ouer

the European Princes, and confirmed the Archbishops in the ostentation of a Count <HI>Palatine,</HI> and absolute power of the gouernment of all, which yet the secular Noble men not onely repined at, but sought by noble courses to preuent; and at last, when no deuise could make gentill the hard wound pullies of the Clergies ambition, they were resolute to effectuate it by force of armes, so that many contentions arose betweene the Byshoppe, Nobles, and Citizens, which ended not without effusion of blood, and ouerthrow of whole armies drawne into the field by particeans, whereby the Citie it selfe felt the smart of war∣like scourges, and saw her walles and houses puld on heapes of rubbish, according to the nature of rage and fu∣ry the end of tumultuous vprors. But at last <HI>Colleine</HI> is re∣edified, and in despight of all frets and fumes, either of <HI>Saxony,</HI> the <HI>Palatine</HI> of the Empire, or confederates of the Princes, acknowledgeth the Archbishop for supreame Gouernour, and he still ouermantleth it with a superstiti∣ous protection, so that the people are kept vnder with his blessing and cursing accordingly.</P>
<P>It now bendeth like a bow, as you see our great Citie from <HI>Surreies</HI> side: the key before the wall is a place of great pleasure; the ports and ramparts worth the obser∣uing, the Palace stately and magnificent, the houses beau∣tifull and comely, the streets sweet, spatious, and well or∣dered, the Inhabitants ciuill, sociable, and superstitious. For amongst the Churches they are of opinion, that the three Kings haue a memorable monument, concerning the birth of our Sauiour, when they were commaunded to returne another way home, but comming hether it was the fortune and glory of this place, not onely to be their refuge from the fury of <HI>Herod</HI> in their life; but a recep∣tacle

for their bodies after death; but how the truth would proue all this ridiculous, it were pity to dispute. Howsoeuer, as I haue said, the Citie and territories now swell with the pride of exemption from the Emperors iurisdiction, and in the same race runne many other fa∣mous Townes, whereby you may see the disioynted go∣uernment of <HI>Germany,</HI> and the poore authority the Em∣perors haue ouer the Electors, and imperiall Cities.</P>
<P>For although <HI>Charles</HI> the 5. had the fortune to imprison the <HI>Lantsgraue</HI> of <HI>Hesse,</HI> and by the seruice of the Duke of <HI>Burbone</HI> to possesse the Castle of Saint <HI>Angelo,</HI> and punish the Pope with a terror of vsurpation, euen ouer his spiritu∣all authoritie; yet was it a sudden greatnesse, and like the blaze of a bauin, lasted but a while. For the German Princes quickly repined, and the next Pope as quickly ra∣tified his owne conditions, so that the Emperors since haue no more to doe in <HI>Italy,</HI> then a Pilgrimme, who is ad∣mitted to see the wonders of our Lady at <HI>Loretto.</HI> But if <NOTE PLACE="marg">How Ger∣many is neighbored.</NOTE> you would know, how <HI>Germany</HI> is neighboured, and be∣loued of strangers, I answer as if my friend should aske me my opinion concerning anothers loue: the heart is vn∣searchable, we onely can discouer the outward counte∣nance, and formall protestations: thus is it with Topogra∣phicall descriptions, wee can say these and these be the Countries and people, but whether enuious, ambitious, reuengefull, traiterous, cowardly, or such like, it must be referred to actions and time. Toward the North lies <HI>Po∣merania, Prussia, Lithuania, Silesia, Podolia,</HI> and <HI>Poland;</HI> but <HI>Poland</HI> now stands for all, within these 300. yeeres a factious Dukedome, limited within her owne territories, now a well compacted kingdome of many Countries; yet wilfully resolute to haue no hereditary Prince amongst

A litle more remote toward the West, beginneth the <HI>Istmus</HI> circum∣spected with the territories of <HI>Mexico, Cusco,</HI> and <HI>Themi∣stian,</HI> with many other Cities of such wealth and mighti∣nes, that the people were slaine by thousands, or rather millions, ere they could sauour other obedience, than ido∣latrous and sauage liberty: On the other side toward the North looketh vp to heauen the new fashioned Ilands of <HI>Cuba, Hispaniola, S.

and <HI>Gallipolis.</HI> It hath many townes, but few cities: onely <HI>Brindisi, Ottonto, Barletto</HI> and <HI>Naples</HI> are of some account: the Countrey is rich in vines, oyle, and silke-wormes, the people are dangerous, superstitious, and the <HI>Villano</HI> liues beastly: the Gentle men are maintainers of liberty and pleasure, scoffers at their owne religion, and as great blas∣phemers as the Greekes of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> insomuch that I haue heard them in their rages cry out, <HI>Iddio Beco: Puttana del Di:</HI> and sweare by the absurd oath of <HI>potta del Cielo,</HI> as in their commedy called <HI>Ruffiana,</HI> and published in print, may appeare: yet is their adoration of her so superstitious, that the Sauiour of the world is accounted her inferiour, her attributes make heauen amazed, and her altars smoke with incense and prophanation. And what is this: but to cause the Prophets to exclaime against the sacrifices of the Queene of Heauen? and what is this, but with <HI>Ahaz</HI> to make images for <HI>Baalim,</HI> and burne children in the valley of <HI>Hinnon,</HI> after the abhomination of the heathen? and what is this? but to build high altars with <HI>Manasses,</HI> and like a Sorcerer, to regard the crying of birds, to vse en∣chauntments, &amp; giue way to the imposturing art of witch∣craft.

Cardinals, for want of lawfull succession; or else by rea∣son of their weaknes, who peraduenture haue right, but are not able to contest with so irregular an aduersary, which makes them step a litle aside for feare of being trampled to peeces indeed.

with wine, they faile in prophesying, and stumble in iudgement, their tables are full of vomit and filthines, and no place is cleane: yea the vision of the Prophet is come vnto them, as the words of a booke which is sealed vp, which men deliuer to one that is learned, saying, read thou, and he replies, I cannot, for it is sealed; then it is deliuered to an ignorant with read thou, but his answer is, I am not learned: so that with the Apostle I may say, that Antichrist shall sit in the Temple of the Lord; and in the latter daies shall be the doctrine of deuils, forbidding to marry, and eat meat, which God hath sanctified: so that with the Euangelist I may lawfully tell you of the Vision of the beast, which rose out of the sea, hauing 7 heads and 10 hornes, and that he opened his mouth vnto blasphe∣my, resembled to the woman araied in purple and rose colour, decked with gold, pretious stones, and pearle, and holding a cup of gold in her hand full of abomination and filthines. The Citie yet is swelling bigger and big∣ger, though nothing comparable to the ostentation of former times: For Historiographers haue confirmed it for greatnes, riches, magnificence, Nobilitie, and famous illustrations the admiration of the world, as contayning 20 English mile in circuit, and shewing a countenance of brauery, and princely structures: But now it onely boa∣steth of some few ancient buildings, the ruines of the <HI>Amphitheater,</HI> certaine <HI>Obelisci,</HI> the swiftnes of <HI>Tiber,</HI> new erected Palaces of <HI>Cardinals,</HI> the Castle of <HI>S<SUP>t</SUP> Angelo olim moles Adriani,</HI> the Popes owne Palace, and the Church of <HI>S.

<HI>Sauoy</HI> hath many other hills, as <HI>Aguabelle,</HI> and <HI>Agabellette,</HI> and is euery way full of strange and vneuen iournies, so that it shall not be amisse to deriue our discourse from the etymologie of the word, which may serue to con∣front ignorance, and enrich vs with the knowledge of things, which is no great burthen, but rather a happines, according to the Poet, <HI>Foelix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas:</HI> You must then vnderstand, that this strange and vnsauoury nation, by reason of the streight and narrow waies to trauell in, was euer subiect to theeues, and being slenderly inhabited had not sufficiency to protect either themselues or passengers from the confused rages of men addicted to spoiles and murthers: wherevpon it conti∣nued in the name and scandall of <HI>Maluoy,</HI> the ill or mis∣cheeuous way, vntill a worthy aduenturer of the countrey attempted a reformation, and shew'd these disordred people the strength of a more powerfull arme, preuailing so farre, that by his industry and fortune, these enormities were not onely purged, but the first causers remoued, I meane the robbers and theeues were either slaughtred outright, or publikely executed for a terrifying example, and as a reward to his vertues, the end of his labours had a quadruplicitie of blessings: First, the Emperor made him a DVKE, gaue him part of <HI>Italy</HI> called now <HI>Piemont,</HI> as if it would speake for it selfe, that it is a countrey at the foote of the mountaine, and inuested him with <HI>iura rega∣lia,</HI> not to be accountable to any Prince for his actions within his owne territories.

of footing. Last of all, it was stored with forts and castles, in such a defensiue manner, that some of them at this day rancke themselues in the highest forme of bulwarkes and and ramparts. But I must not thus passe ouer their ac∣counts, nor vilipend their glory. For they boast of anti∣quity of Kings, as that <HI>Hanibal</HI> found <HI>Brunco</HI> disseised of his inheritance by his yonger brother, and so rectified that discord. That <HI>Bitultus</HI> or <HI>Bituitus,</HI> another King, was ta∣ken prisoner by <HI>Q. Fabius Maximus,</HI> some 50. yeeres after <HI>Hanibals</HI> passage into <HI>Italy.</HI> And that <HI>Cotius</HI> raigned in the time of <HI>Augustus</HI> the Emperour, so that till the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals</HI> dissolued all gouernments of the West, these coun∣tries remained firme in their former renowne, as part of <HI>Gallia Cisalpina:</HI> but afterward mischeefe was added to mischeefe, till it was concluded otherwise by time and worthy endeauours, as you haue heard: whereupon <HI>Chambery</HI> was the cheefest towne on this side the Alps, sci∣tuated in a delicate rich valley, full of Gentle-mens hou∣ses, on the other side of the mountaine <HI>Agabella,</HI> ouer which the traueller spendeth commonly fiue or six hours: it hath a handsome castle now manned with Spanyards, in the behalfe of the Duke, the City is orderly ditcht and fortified, &amp; by the fauor of a pretty riuer, hath commodity of a reasonable water, otherwise it is snowy through the countrey, and the people are <HI>Strumosae,</HI> as in <HI>Switzerland.</HI> The suburbs are not fully recouered of her ruines, which they were subiect vnto in the yeere 1600. when the King of <HI>France,</HI> as stomaching the cunning violence of the Duke of <HI>Sauoy's</HI> detention, of the <HI>Marquisat</HI> of <HI>Salust,</HI> came to <HI>Grenoble</HI> by the marches, and after good surueigh besieged <HI>Chambery,</HI> lodging in the suburbs, and commanded <HI>Villeroy</HI> to parley with <HI>Iacob</HI> and the President <HI>Rochet,</HI> about the
<PB N="96" REF="58"/>
surrendring the towne and castle, whom at last the people compelled to a composition, as finding it impossible to resist the French forces: thus within three dayes was the towne, and within six the castle surrendred, and <HI>Le Buise</HI> a Gentle-man of <HI>Daulphine</HI> left for Gouernour: but the suc∣cesse of these actions was not comparable to the fortune of attaining mount <HI>Melian,</HI> and S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Katherines</HI> fort, two of the strongest holds that euer I saw. For mount <HI>Melian</HI> is <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mount Melian.</NOTE> seated on the top of an high and rocky mountaine, the ditch bankes very steepe, and the defences consist of fiue great bastions flanked in most warlike manner, to which is but one passage, and that from the towne. The King (ac∣cording to the condition of men) transported onely with outward shewes, sayd it was impregnable, but vnderstan∣ding himselfe afterward a little better, commanded to be∣siege it: so the Marquis <HI>Rosny,</HI> great master of the artille∣ry, drew vp seuen canons by the force of armes, and strength of men, and two batteries were made by <HI>De Bourdes,</HI> Lieutenant Generall of the artillery, against the bastions of <HI>Maiuosin</HI> and <HI>Bouillars,</HI> besides an old Tower, which had beene shaken by <HI>Francis</HI> the first.</P>
<P>The Fort was commanded by the Earle of <HI>Brindis,</HI> who had all prouision for his defence, and like one of <HI>Dauids</HI> Worthies, prooued an honourable Seruitor, had not the <HI>Duke</HI> failed, and brake his word, leauing him to such a fortune, as extremities accustome. For hee held it out foure months, after many thousand shot of fortie canons, whose voyces sounded out nothing, but terrour; and effects made way vnto feare and mistrust: and accor∣dingly, seeing the French had too good footing to bee re∣mooued, a composition was condescended vnto, and the castle surrendred.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="58"/>
The towne of <HI>Aguabelle</HI> is scituated at the foot of a great rocke, as if it lay asleepe in the lap of security. By it <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aguabelle.</NOTE> runnes the riuer of <HI>Arck,</HI> it was surprized by the good en∣deauours of the <HI>Signeurs</HI> of <HI>Crequy</HI> and <HI>Morges,</HI> not giuing them of the castle any leasure to burne it. At the same time was <HI>Conflans</HI> commanding the passage of <HI>Tarentaies</HI> and <HI>Carboniers,</HI> with all the straights of <HI>Morien</HI> in the Kings hands: but if you would know what pleased him indeed, it was the braue surprizall of S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Katherines</HI> Fort, a gift as if fortune should open her lap, and bid him with cheere∣fulnesse be his owne caruer. For it is scited on a high hill within six mile of <HI>Geneua,</HI> and not onely ouerlookes the Countrey, but raiseth her rocky sides in such a manner, as if it cared neither for battery, nor bullet, but would return them backe againe, as you see a man spit against the winde to his owne defiling.</P>
<P>Concerning <HI>Geneua,</HI> by the water it seems impregnable, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Geneua.</NOTE> as washed with the pleasant billowes of the lake <HI>Lemanus,</HI> and yet made vnaccessable, by reason of certaine marishes, ouer which neither horse nor cart can trauell: by the land it hath all the helps of art &amp; nature, yet not without danger of treason and stratagems: but that I am perswaded God hath reserued it, as little <HI>Zoar</HI> was a city of refuge, when all the cities of <HI>Sodome</HI> and <HI>Gomorrha</HI> were on a blaze round about it. So <HI>Sauoy,</HI> the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> the <HI>Pope,</HI> and her owne treasons were all disappoynted, and it still remaines in the freedome of ablessed protection, boasting of no∣thing more, then her 300. yeeres continuance in an vni∣formity of religion, and that it retaineth the true method of the Primatiue Church. But to S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Katherines</HI> Fort a∣gaine. It consisteth of fiue bastions, which are not walled but ditcht. well furnished with artillery, and had 600. men
<PB N="98" REF="59"/>
to defend it, who yet were in seuerall distractions, when they perceiued the confidence of the Kings army, not to take all that paines without further satisfaction; so they submitted to the clemency of Count <HI>Soysons,</HI> after the King was departed, to goe meet the Queene at <HI>Lyons,</HI> and thus were these impregnable places made the tennis-ball of fortune, and left vs this obseruation, that men, money, and endeauours, will ouercome all disasters, and make the very mountaines yeeld to heroike resolutions. This is that Fort, which was excepted in the composition between <HI>Sauoy</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> This is that Fort, that was to keepe the Countrey in obedience. This is that Fort, whose gouern∣ment being denied to Duke <HI>Byron,</HI> startled his resolutions, and plunged him in the irrecouerable gulph of disconten∣ted treasons. The towne of <HI>Moriana</HI> is beautified with a Colledge, Monastery, and Churches, and tooke the first name, either because the people are swartish &amp; blacke; or the earth (like some places of <HI>Aethiopia)</HI> resembleth clots of pitch, and so indeede their swine are of the same colour. A little further lies <HI>Bramont,</HI> a city of that antiquity, that <HI>Caesar</HI> filleth some part of his Commentaries with her re∣lations. The passages to all these places are somewhat fearefull to strangers. For to ride vnder, and behold such mighty mountaines and rockes, to see the snow dissolue and runne downe with that impetuous force, making such <HI>anfractus</HI> and ruptures, that diuers hundred mils are tur∣ned with the same, to heare the terrible noyse of the chan∣nell, whose foundation is huge stones disseuered from the hils: to see the pine trees stand vnder like a carpet, ready to receiue the falling of the snow, is a thing both of admi∣ration and pleasure. But for mine owne part, it startled me not at all, in regard I had marched ouer some moun∣taines
<PB N="99" REF="59"/>
and places in <HI>Ireland;</HI> especially <HI>Pen men mawre</HI> in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pen men mawre in Wales.</NOTE> <HI>Wales,</HI> which for the length of the passage, is the feareful∣lest that euer I saw, because the stony rocke hangeth ouer so many hundred fathome high, and the sea lieth vnder as great a depth: so that a quarter of a mile together, the way is not eight foot broad, and (as it were) patch vp in the broken places, with furrs and bauin, to keepe both horse and man from slipping. Besides, after a great frost you shall haue an hundred load of stones fall at once from the rocke into the sea, and almost batter the fence in peeces, which in the fearefull report, and sudden viewing by a new commer, must needs be troublesome, and indeed surmoun∣teth any place of <HI>Sauoy,</HI> or the Alps.</P>
<P>Thus much for <HI>Sauoy,</HI> whose eldest sonne is now called Prince of <HI>Piemont,</HI> hauing his court a part from the Dukes palace, with a small guard of <HI>Switzers,</HI> and liueth in rea∣sonable eminence, knowing his father to bee an absolute Prince, himselfe a nephew to <HI>Spaine,</HI> &amp; neerly allied to the house of <HI>Austria.</HI> As for the Dukes iealousie of the power of the Clergy, and the Spanish encroachments, I am resol∣ued (like a smoothering fire) it will one day burst foorth into flames of despight, and did he not rather feare <HI>France,</HI> as a neere neighbour, and more dangerous aduersary, he would peraduenture attempt further into <HI>Italy,</HI> in despight of <HI>Spaines</HI> ouer-watching. But because it is a thanklesse labour to gleane the fields of other folkes haruest, and that you haue whole volumes of the Spanish, French, Low-Countries, Hungary, Venice, Portugall, and Turkish af∣faires, I will entermeddle no further: onely I must speake a little concerning <HI>Millane,</HI> and so leaue <HI>Italy</HI> betweene the straights of her owne pleasures at home, and suspicion of forraine intrusion abroad.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP.</HI> XIII. The Story of <HI>MILLANE.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Bout the yeere 1492. the Realme of <HI>Naples</HI> reuolting, <HI>Rhene</HI> Duke of <HI>Lo∣raine</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The occur∣rences of Millane.</NOTE> was sent for by the Pope to be in∣uested King, which was the first mo∣tiue for the <HI>French</HI> to be admitted into the attractiue delights of <HI>Italy.</HI> For when many hands had (as it were) torn a peeces the peace of this Countrey, it seemed a charitable and meritorious worke to contriue an establishment, and redacting it to vniformity, which the Controller of King∣domes at that time, I meane the Pope, determined by this course, had not the very next yeere his minde receiued a further perturbation. For this Pope was a <HI>Spanyard,</HI> by the name of <HI>Roderick Borgia,</HI> or <HI>Alexander</HI> the sixt, whom the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and Duke of <HI>Millane</HI> beeing an vsurper at that time, established in the Papacy, because they might bee assisted from him in all their demands. Where∣upon the <HI>Duke,</HI> by the name of <HI>Lodwick Sforza,</HI> and an vnkle, surprizeth the Cittadle of <HI>Millane,</HI> insinuated into the loue of the principall nobility, and confederated with many Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> to corroborate his new gotten great∣nesse. All this yet hindred not the next iourney of <HI>Charles</HI> the eighth, King of <HI>France,</HI> who now pretending a very right to <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Sicilia,</HI> with much adoe was incited to passe the Alps, and take his pleasure in these plenteous fields, in which, that his walkes might be the more smooth, hee condescended to certaine articles with this Vsurper
<PB N="101" REF="60"/>
<HI>Lodwick,</HI> much about the time that <HI>Iohn</HI> the true Duke of <HI>Millane</HI> died, leauing behinde him one son and daughter, in whose minority <HI>Lodwick,</HI> as hee had before wrested the gouernment, now assumeth the title, had not his forward∣nesse beene somewhat intercepted by this French visitati∣on, whereupon he perswaded the <HI>Venetians,</HI> who of them∣selues were suspicious enough, when they saw the French Kings glorious entrance into <HI>Florence,</HI> to some interposi∣tion, and so both <HI>Millane</HI> and <HI>Venice</HI> grew iealous of King <HI>Charles</HI> his proceedings, which yet could not bee so cun∣ningly trauersed, but hee was made acquainted with their vnconstancy, and held his peace till a fitter opportunity. For now he was to make his pompous entrance into <HI>Rome,</HI> where the wals both of the City, and the Castle S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Angelo</HI> fell downe miraculously before him. By which occasion, as if the sword of <HI>Iehu</HI> should kill the Priests of <HI>Baal,</HI> is prognosticated, that by the hand of <HI>France,</HI> the enormities of the Church, and the monstrous abuses of the Clergy, should be winnowed and throughly fanned: but it should seeme there was a tricke of preuention put vpon him, and the name of an Emperour taught him another way to ac∣knowledge the Popes fauour. For 1495. about the 12. of <HI>May</HI> he enters <HI>Naples</HI> in an Imperiall habit, as Emperor of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> by the Popes grant and confirmation: but he had not possessed it fiue months, before there was a generall reuolt concluded against him, as at the same in∣stant <HI>Millane</HI> had done with <HI>Lodwick:</HI> whereupon the King somewhat fearefull of an Italian receipt, or other strange surprizals, returnes the next yeere home againe, with purpose to renew the warre, and reintegrate his for∣mer losses: but the Cardinall of S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Malo</HI> hindred it at that instant, had not the Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> perceiuing how the
<PB N="102" REF="61"/>
<HI>Venctian</HI> and <HI>Millenois</HI> triumphed for the departure of the <HI>French,</HI> incensed the King againe to punish them both 1497. which was also interceded against by his brother the Duke of <HI>Orleance,</HI> who disclaimed in his owne name or person to disturb the peace of <HI>Millane:</HI> yet had not suf∣ficient authority to diuert the Kings designes, and so the warres of <HI>Italy</HI> were renewed.</P>
<P>Now is <HI>Lodwick</HI> perplexed indeede, and compelled to prostrate himselfe before the <HI>Couchant Lyon</HI> of <HI>Venice,</HI> and lower then the same vseth so his submission, that the noble beast enclineth to succour him: yet in such a manner, as <HI>Israel</HI> assisted <HI>Iuda</HI> against <HI>Assyria,</HI> being fearefull of extir∣pation her selfe; but as soon as the publike enemy was de∣parted, the emulation at one anothers greatnesse drew whole armies into the field: so playd <HI>Simeon, Eleazer</HI> and <HI>Ichoconon</HI> with the <HI>Romans,</HI> when their ciuill mutinies bar∣racadoed the streets with heaps of slaughtered carkasses, and filled the channels with the spilt-out bloud of mur∣thered men. For <HI>Millane</HI> is now iealous of <HI>Florence, Flo∣rence</HI> of <HI>Millane,</HI> both of <HI>Venice, Venice</HI> of both, and all three of the <HI>French:</HI> yet <HI>Charles</HI> goes on, and leauing garrison almost ouer all <HI>Italy,</HI> returnes home againe: but at his ca∣stle of <HI>Amboyse</HI> dies of an Apoplexy, 1498. after hee had vnfortunately strucke his head against a low doore, going to see a set at tennis. <HI>Lewis</HI> the 12. then succeeded, and not onely claimed the Dutchy of <HI>Millane, iure millitari,</HI> but takes vpon him the stile by right of succession, and a property of inheritance, as resolued to maintaine, what his father had gotten, and so gloriously purchased, to which he is adiuted by all the supportation, wherein Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> could animate him, who to raise vp his ba∣stard sonne <HI>Caesar Borgia</HI> to a Princely throne in <HI>Italie,</HI>

<P>All this while is <HI>Lewis</HI> at <HI>Lyons:</HI> but who will not run to <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ssion of Millane.</NOTE> carry so great a King glad tydings; so that he is quickly ad∣uertized of the fortunate proceedings of his army, and as quickly trauels ouer the Alps, beating the way of Mount <HI>Sinese,</HI> entring <HI>Millane</HI> in triumph, and left for Gouernour, <HI>Philip</HI> Lord of <HI>Rauestine,</HI> and <HI>Baptista Fregose</HI> his Lieute∣nant. The castle was yet protected with the guard of 3000. men, and committed to the loyalty of <HI>Bernardine</HI> of <HI>Corte</HI> borne in <HI>Pauia,</HI> who by his good beginning gaue life to their opinion, which supposed it impregnable, and not to be taken by force. But what men cannot in the Ly∣ons, they compasse with the Foxes skin, and thus farre deride both the strength of souldiers, and pride of fortifi∣cations, that where the minde may be corrupted vpon any tearmes of disloyalty, neither wals, ramparts, nor man∣hood, can preuent the power and deceit of bribery. This appeared in the disposition or <HI>Bernardine,</HI> and <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Fresques;</HI> whom the cunning of <HI>Triuulce,</HI> and the disbur∣sing 20000. crownes, quickly diuerted from their first re∣solutions, and made a breach in the <HI>Citadle</HI> without mine or battery.</P>
<P>Thus was the French possessed of this Duchy without competition, or diffidence, and <HI>Lewis</HI> the 12 made his royall entry accordingly. But marke the vicissitude of all things, <HI>Millane</HI> reuolts againe, and <HI>Sforza</HI> recouers all as easily, as he lost it, in which busines the <HI>Swisses</HI> proued very disloyall to the <HI>French,</HI> and the lookers on were a∣mazed to behold fortune proud of inconstancy, so that

this vse may be raised thereby: How euer men satisfie ambition for the time, yet are they certaine of nothing vnder the sunne. Againe, when by indirect courses de∣signes are concluded, they must stand the better on their guard, and prepare their patience when any alteration startleth resolution: thus fared it with <HI>Millane</HI> againe. For as you see a glooing heat in Aprill changed on the sodaine to bitter blasts and cloudy tempests, so was <HI>Sfor∣zas</HI> iollity reuersed, himselfe surprized, taken and caried prisoner to <HI>Lions,</HI> where denied the benefit of a princely execution, and resolued nothing can be so acceptable to a man in misery, as a noble death, worthy the name of a Romane, hee dies at once, whether for griefe, or great heart, it matters not: yet doth the King of <HI>France</HI> pardon <HI>Millane,</HI> and at last keeps all in quiet. But the warres of <HI>Naples</HI> are renewed 1501. and the kingdome is diuided betweene <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Aragon,</HI> so that great alteration hap∣pens in <HI>Italy,</HI> and within two yeeres there is a generall ouerthrow of the French with the taking of the Castle at <HI>Naples</HI> by the Spaniard: yet is not <HI>Beniamin</HI> discomfited, but calleth his brethren together, and with more setled courages reintegrate their estates, and so the French make head againe, attending the good hower of a better pro∣sperity.</P>
<P>About this time in August died Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the sixt of poyson, which he had prepared for the Cardinals: but his taster by mistaking the flagons tooke away both his life, and the pride of his expectation concerning <HI>Caesar Borgias</HI> glory, or his further desires to set the fuell of <HI>Italy</HI> on a blaze: After him to stint the strife of many Nati∣ons expecting the Papacie, old <HI>Francis Piccolamini</HI> Cardi∣nall of <HI>Sienna</HI> was chosen Pope, by the name of <HI>Pius</HI> the

third, in memory of <HI>Pius</HI> the second his Vnkle, who made him Cardinall: but a yong man must prepare himselfe to dye, and an old man cannot liue long: so he continues scarce a moneth, leauing his roome, and the glory of all <HI>Rome</HI> to the Cardinall of <HI>S. Pierre,</HI> who was made Pope by the name of <HI>Iulius</HI> the second 1504. in which yeere <HI>Naples</HI> wrested her head out of the French coller, and seemed more glad to be supported by <HI>Arragon:</HI> nor was this sufficient, but vpon a supposition to extinguish the light of the lamps of France in Italy, a new league 1511. was corroborated by the vnstedfast Italians against the French, which when the King perceiued, and that he con∣iectured, how his barke must bee driuen to dangerous streits by the vncertaine windes of alteration, he transpor∣ted his Court and Councell from <HI>Florence</HI> to <HI>Millane,</HI> and from <HI>Millane</HI> to <HI>Lions,</HI> determining to weary them with tedious iournies and attendance, so is <HI>Italy</HI> perplexed, and the Nobles repine without remedy; till at last the Em∣peror <HI>Maximilian</HI> spreadeth the wings of the Aegle, and clocketh the Princes of Italy vnder her sides: where∣upon with the help of the <HI>Spaniard</HI> called the holy league, warre is made against <HI>Lewis,</HI> and the Duchy of <HI>Millane</HI> recouered againe to the vse of <HI>Maximilian Sforza</HI> grand∣childe to <HI>Lodwick,</HI> who was inuested Duke by the Cardi∣nall of <HI>Sion</HI> about the end of December, yet by the <HI>Swiz∣zes</HI> assistance, and loyalty, the Castles of <HI>Millane</HI> and <HI>Cre∣mona</HI> hold still for the French; and the imbers are not so extinguished, but fire appeares, and yeeldeth this com∣fort, that if they moderately proceed, a greater heat and more quickning light may be made.</P>
<P>In the midst of which convulsions of <HI>Italy,</HI> Pope <HI>Iulius</HI> dies, and <HI>Iohn</HI> Cardinall of <HI>Medices</HI> succeeded him by the

title of <HI>Leo</HI> the 10. whereby a second truce was ratified betweene <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> and the King of <HI>Arragon:</HI> so that <HI>Lewis</HI> made great benefit of this <HI>interim</HI> and cessa∣tion, confederating with the <HI>Venetians,</HI> by whose assistance he brought a royall Armie into the Duchy of <HI>Millane:</HI> but the Pope hauing sent 40000 ducats amongst the <HI>Switzers,</HI> quickly weighed downe their former stedfast∣nes, and so when <HI>Millane</HI> and <HI>Cremona</HI> was stored with them, they were corrupted to be traitors to their first ma∣sters, and accordingly against all expectation, with an odi∣ous reuolt encountred the French in as cheerefull a man∣ner, as euer before they had entertained the crownes of the sunne against the <HI>Italians:</HI> so that ere the yeere went about, the Castles of <HI>Millane</HI> and <HI>Cremona</HI> returne to the obedience of the Duke, and King <HI>Lewis</HI> held nothing in <HI>Italy</HI> but the lanterne of <HI>Genes,</HI> which afterward the <HI>Geno∣uais</HI> razed to the ground, both to preuent the occasion of future tyranizing ouer them, and to manifest their invete∣rate malice against the flower-de-luce, though it glistered neuer so gloriously in an azure field.

<HI>Sforza</HI> in <HI>Millane,</HI> and coadiuted by the Duke of <HI>Burbon</HI> wrested this composition, that <HI>Maximilian</HI> shall bee the Kings pentioner in <HI>France,</HI> and the <HI>Switzers</HI> to depart with bagg and baggage.</P>
<P>Thus are the French once againe welcommed into the pleasures of <HI>Lombardy,</HI> and <HI>Francis</HI> the first is Lord of this vnquiet Duchy, which now is detained with a seem∣ing securitie, because the Pope applauded the successe, and according to the superstition of those times, and po∣licie of temporizing, blessed the royall standard of <HI>Va∣loies.</HI> But about the 20 of <HI>Iune</HI> 1519. the Emperor <HI>Ma∣ximilian</HI> paies his tribute of life to the first enlarger of breath, and <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> competitor with the King of <HI>France,</HI> is preferred by the name of <HI>Carolus Quintus,</HI> inheritor of <HI>Spaine,</HI> with so many titles besides, that the Harolds were troubled in the proclaiming them, and the stile was tedious to be divulged. Betweene these two great Princes so many grudges increased, and stimulatory causes of enmitie appeared, that at last open defiances proclaimed an vnappeased warre, and the trumpets of <HI>Bel∣lona</HI> ecchoed nothing but disturbance in the fields of <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> especially after the Pope declares himselfe against <HI>France,</HI> and by way of prophesie fore-telleth the ruine of the <HI>French</HI> gouernment in <HI>Italy,</HI> adding withall some omi∣nous signes of calamitie to ensue, and casting vp an vnto∣ward reckning in this manner: That on <HI>S.

At last the fatall stroke is giuen indeede, mischeeues throng on one another so hastily, that the <HI>French</HI> 1522 are expelled <HI>Italy,</HI> so farre from hoping to augment their glories, that they are in despaire to recouer their owne, formerly possessed. For presently the Castle of <HI>Millane</HI> yeelded to the conqueror, the garrison was quickly dispersed, or rather consumed with sicknesse, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> insulted, the <HI>Italians</HI> trembled, and in a word all the French particeans were eaten out with hunger, disea∣ses, and mutinies.</P>
<P>Thus was <HI>Francis Sforza</HI> invested in the Duchy of <HI>Mil∣lane,</HI> and a generall league betweene the <HI>Millanoies, Empe∣ror,</HI> and <HI>Venetians</HI> concluded: but for all this successe of the confederates (with the addition of the Duke of <HI>Bur∣bons</HI> reuolt to the Emperor) the French Armie continues in Italy, and the Admirall with new forces breatheth out new malice against <HI>Millane,</HI> besieging the towne, battering the Citadle, and trampling their best fields to durt: in

<P>Notwithstanding <HI>Francis Sforza</HI> is in no securitie of his estate, as suspecting the Emperors demand of 1200000 ducats for his expences, and that he intended a plaine vsurpation of the whole Duchie, whereupon disabled by force to suppresse him, he flies to the succour of his wits, and tampers with the <HI>Marquis</HI> of <HI>Pescara</HI> for the inuesture of the royall mantle of <HI>Naples,</HI> vpon condition to ende∣uour the spanish expulsion out of <HI>Millane;</HI> which designe and proiect the Pope and other Princes not onely allow, but as principall agents are imployed in the negotiation: but the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> is incensed, and taking notice of these treasons, as he now entitleth them, raised vp the dust, that made <HI>Sforza</HI> blinde, and thus punisheth him, as chiefe delinquent.

Thus en∣dured this Duchy all the plagues depending on a misera∣ble warre, till at last 1530. the children of <HI>France</HI> are re∣leased, and a peace ratified betweene the Emperor and the French King, who in the articles of agreement surrendred his claime to all these territories in <HI>Italy,</HI> and the Emperor is proud, hee hath so easie a passage into the countrey, which although seemed much distasting to the Princes, and was as thornes in the sides of the Clergy, as appeared <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Spani∣ard absolute ly possesseth Millane.</NOTE> amongst the Cardinals, when they were enforced to ratifie the same: yet was the Emperor carelesse of their displea∣sure, and proceeded in what iourney he listed in despight of the Papacie; onely with a colourable show of commi∣seration, he restored <HI>Sforza</HI> to the Duchy of <HI>Millane,</HI> but kept the Castles of <HI>Cremona,</HI> and it in his hands: so that presently after his death, it was incorporated to the crowne of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and hath euer since looked with the eyes of ielousie and repining vpon all their Gouernors.</P>

But long before it suffred a diuision into <HI>Cisalpinam</HI> and <HI>Transalpinam: Transalpinam</HI> againe into <HI>Celticam, Belgicam,</HI> and <HI>Acquita∣nicam:</HI> whereby the best parts of <HI>Lombardy,</HI> the low Countries, and all on this side the <HI>Rhene</HI> westward march∣ed vnder the standard of <HI>France,</HI> and was proud to be re∣gistred in the booke of her accounts: so that whatsoeuer hath bin since disioynted from this French frame, may be resembled vnto children pull'd out of the armes of a lo∣uing mother. But I will quietly bring you into her own roomes, whereby you shall partly behold the beauty and workmanship of her building: onely by the way I must a litle touch the Etymologie of the word, and tell you, that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> in Greeke signifieth milke, and so the people <NOTE PLACE="marg">Galli of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE> from their complexion, and resemblance to whitenes, were called <HI>Galli</HI> or <HI>Galati.</HI> For other particulars, you haue <HI>Caesars</HI> commentaries, and well compacted histories, which haue tossed and tumbled the lodgings, yea the very beds of her chambers, and our owne acquaintance hath

It was once the nurse of valour, and afforded her vberant paps in those daies to such men, as trampled ouer the fields of <HI>Greece,</HI> robbed <HI>Apollos</HI> Temple at <HI>Delphos,</HI> fetcht away the spoiles of <HI>Asia,</HI> and by the assistance of <HI>Brennus</HI> an Englishman perfor∣med actions of wonderment, and applause. It was after∣ward the pride of Roman Consuls, and the greatest am∣bition thought it selfe sufficiently recompenced with her gouernment, when <HI>Rome</HI> had yet lessned her roome to make it prouinciall.</P>
<P>Presently followed the diuision of the Empire, and all the gouernment almost of <HI>Europe</HI> was rent asunder with the furie of very strange and sauage Nations, whose con∣fused <HI>Chaos</HI> of barbarisme the brauery and goodnes of this countrey redacted to vniformity.

<PB N="114" REF="67"/>
and boasteth of an Vniuersitie, but more properly of the great concourse of Merchants: It is beautified with ma∣ny monuments, especially the Pallace, wherein King <HI>Ri∣chard</HI> the second, the sonne of the blacke Prince was borne; and another without the Towne, a worke euer since the Emperor <HI>Galienus,</HI> and then supposed a glorious <HI>Amphitheater.</HI> The towne of <HI>Tholouse</HI> is more proud of antiquitie, and telleth of time before <HI>Troies</HI> devastation: yea remembreth since <HI>Deborah</HI> Iudge of <HI>Israel</HI> was fa∣mous for her wisdome and gouernment. It hath now a well disciplined schoole, a court of Parliament, populous streets, and reasonable buildings, but indeed they seeme very ancient, and for some speciall structures may carry the credit of magnificence. The other townes are ma∣ny and very good, except countrey villages, which are as rude as in other places, and the Pesant liueth like a drudge, not daring scarse drinke of the wine of his owne garden, lest he should not raise such profit, as would answer the proportion of his rent.

<P>The fift part is <HI>Normandy,</HI> diuided into the countries of <HI>Constantine, Bessin, Maine,</HI> and <HI>Auge,</HI> in which as princi∣pall <NOTE PLACE="marg">Normandy.</NOTE> Cities are recorded <HI>Roan, Pontoise, Alenson, Argenni, Caen, Baieux,</HI> and some few others: The people boast of their endeuors in spinning linnen cloth, excellent wits, and able bodies for the warres: But of all other things, they would exceede (especially the Gentlemen) for man∣suetude, courtship, and affabilitie in attending the affaires of peace, and quietnes.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="68"/>
The sixt part challengeth the title of the <HI>Ile of France,</HI> a countrey so named, because it is in a manner environed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ile of France</NOTE> with excellent riuers, which make the ground so fertile, that for number of Townes, Gentlemens houses, places of pleasure, conueniencie of prouision, and other parti∣culars tending to brauery and profit, it excelleth all the countrey: But her chiefest pride ariseth from the posses∣sion of <HI>Paris</HI> on the riuer <HI>Sequana,</HI> or the <HI>Sein,</HI> the mistris of all Cities; and <HI>Orleans</HI> on the <HI>Loire</HI> famous for many remarkable actions, betweene whom almost 40 English mile is one cawsey of stone, or otherwise there were no trauelling, especially in winter: For all the ground is so fat and clammy, that <HI>Paris</HI> it selfe is called <HI>Lutetia</HI> of <HI>luto,</HI> or the durtinesse of the soile.</P>
<P>The seuenth part belongeth to <HI>Bourges,</HI> or <HI>Berry,</HI> a coun∣trey <NOTE PLACE="marg">Berry.</NOTE> boasting of many delicate things; but the Citie is quite out of patience, if you either forget her monuments, or contradict her first founder to be <HI>Ogiges,</HI> the grand∣childe of <HI>Noe:</HI> It is enclosed with the countries of <HI>Tou∣raine, Burbon,</HI> and <HI>Niuernois,</HI> and on the riuer of <HI>Loire</HI> washing cleane the fields with his strange ouer-flowings are erected <HI>Cosme, Le Charity,</HI> the Citie of <HI>Neuers</HI> with her long bridge, <HI>Molins,</HI> and many other townes, some of hansome eminence, and some of lesse consequence.</P>

called <HI>Gallia Lugdunensis,</HI> from her owne name <HI>Lugdunum</HI> and diuers monuments of water-workes, bridges, towers, and temples, were magnificent in <HI>Caesars</HI> time.

For although euer since the Pope made it his seat, &amp; established heere a Conclaue for the Cardinals, it hath since rema<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ed firme to the Roman Clergy: yet is it sited in this pro∣uince, and called <HI>France</HI> her naturall mother: some reckon heerein the three Bishoprickes of <HI>Carpentoract, Lissa</HI> and <HI>Vaurias,</HI> with many other townes, allowing vs to call it the Principate of <HI>Orange,</HI> and will haue vs take notice, that the house of <HI>Nassau,</HI> which challengeth the glory of the Low-Countries, as by the worthy life of the last Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> (whose younger sonnes are still so famous for the Belgick warres) may appeare: was extracted from hence, and glo∣rieth in her denomination accordingly.

is still a Dukedome and County graced with such royal∣ties, that by their owne prerogatiues they haue brought armies into the field, and proclaimed the absolute free∣domes of their gouernment: yea, in the latter times of contestation with <HI>France,</HI> they held the dignity of a Parlia∣ment: kept a full palace sequestred: and instituted the no∣ble order of knighthood called the golden Fleece: some would annex the <HI>Dutchy</HI> of <HI>Barr</HI> vnto it, which I thinke more properly belongs to <HI>Loraine,</HI> and many <HI>Earledomes</HI> of estimation. The petty riuers receiue augmentation from the springs of her fields, and the swift <HI>Araris</HI> is sent into the sea from her mountaines. Her cheefest cities are <HI>Digion</HI> and <HI>Austune,</HI> maintaining regall tribunals, expo∣sing ostentous edifices, boasting of great antiquity, setting out the brauery of diuers monuments and palaces, and supporting the necessities of many people. The townes of the Dukedome would bee called <HI>Latornelle, Rochpot, Chalons, Verdune, Seure, Argilly, Sausieu,</HI> and such like. The townes of the County please the inhabitants with the titles of <HI>Iussy, Gray, Dole, Besanson, Quingay, Salins, Arboies, Paligny, Bouteuant, Noseroy, Vennes, Chastillion,</HI> and diuers others: none of which, but either boasteth of one excel∣lency or other; some for making salt, some for fulling cloth, some for spinning linnen, some for mines and mine∣rals, some for excellent pastures, some for vines, some for cattle, and all for good building, plenty of Gentle-men, and concourse of people.</P>

both alike, he will bee auxiliary to either, and sometimes enemie to both, as being such a Prince, who aduanceth and diminisheth at his pleasure the Marquisate of <HI>Ponce,</HI> the Earledoms of <HI>Vademont, Verdune, Blamont, Demanche, Marchen,</HI> and diuers other coronets, with the immunities of sundry Baronies; all depending vpon his <HI>praemium</HI> &amp; <HI>poena.</HI> The townes of this countrey are <HI>Metts,</HI> famous for the Emperours siege, and many warlike fortifications, <HI>Nancy, Voige, Chaligy, Vaudmont, Dompair, Rosiers, Rum∣belluillier,</HI> and such like worthy description: but as I sayd in the beginning, I intend not to extenuate the endeauours of other men, either in their trauels or commentaries, nor tell any abrupt tales, when such and so many famous Au∣thors and Cosmographers speake so orderly and plainely. Therefore I referre you thither for more ample discourses, especially concerning such cities as I haue ouerpassed, and yet flourish at this hower in seuerall countries; it shall only suffice me to name the countries and principall places, that I may prepare you the better to attend my comparison, when I shall set out <HI>England</HI> to the sale with her ornaments of commendation indeed.</P>
<P>The thirteenth roome of the palace of <HI>France</HI> her Ho∣nour, is appropriate to <HI>Callis</HI> and <HI>Boloigne,</HI> maintaining the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Boloigne.</NOTE> sea-shores ouer against <HI>Kent,</HI> and the sweet breathing mouth of the <HI>Thames</HI> in <HI>England:</HI> but in such emulation being so neere, that either they complaine to be thus long disioynted from her gouernment, or seeme offended that we euer possessed them, and could keepe them no longer: much of this countrey once belonged to <HI>Artoys,</HI> and was diuided betweene the Emperour and <HI>France,</HI> by way of composition. But if you would know, wherin and wherof it boasteth indeed, it is for two famous Dukes of the same,
<PB N="122" REF="71"/>
or if you will, but Earles; who by their valours and heroik endeauours, obtained the noble Diadems of the world: the one was <HI>Godfrey,</HI> inuested King of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and made like another <HI>Agamemnon,</HI> Captaine Generall of the Chri∣stian army against the <HI>Saracens.</HI> The other was <HI>Stephen,</HI> sonne of Duke <HI>Williams</HI> daughter of <HI>Normandy,</HI> raised to the dignity of <HI>England,</HI> and maintaining the possession a∣gainst <HI>Maud</HI> the Empresse and her sonne, during his life.</P>
<P>The last part of this glorious Kingdome may include <HI>Vermond</HI> and <HI>Picardy,</HI> whose principall townes are <HI>Guise,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Picardy.</NOTE> <HI>La Fere, Han, S<SUP>t</SUP>.

<P>Thus you see with what a glistring crowne the head of <HI>France</HI> is impaled in the chaire of Maiesty, and may visit the palace of honour with more and better attendance of Princes, Dukes, Earles, and Gentle-men, then any abso∣lute Monarch of the world: yet because it hath some de∣fects in meere matters of state, according to the true pro∣sperity of a countrey: and that diuers deficiencies chance somewhat disgraciously vnto her, like staines and spots to pure linnen, I cannot yeeld her the pride of happinesse: be∣cause you shall see in my next book of comparison, wherin her fulnesse of glory is ecclipsed, and how wee our selues enioy many prerogatiues before her.</P>

In these are numbred 228. great townes, murited with wals, ramparts, ditches, warlike ports, bridges, and fortifi∣cations. Besides, their guards are continuall, either of their owne Burgers, or Souldiers lying in garison, according to the proximity of the enemy, importance of the place, ne∣cessity of affaires, or inconueniences of the time. The vil∣lages or dorps are 6300. beautified with embattelled Churches of many seuerall fashions, frequented with en∣tercourses of people, adorned with handsome markets, and priuiledged by ancient immunities, faires, solemne fe∣stiuals, and neighbourly meetings; besides granges, ca∣stles, religious houses, towres, and Yonkers mannor-pla∣ces.

The Countrey is euery where visited with nauigable riuers, nor come they empty handed, but affoord delicate water and excellent fish: but what talke I of fish? when the large O∣cean is so nigh, out of whose store-house a man may take, without being called in question, or repining. It is beau∣tified with many woods, affoording timber to build with∣all, and the pleasure of hunting. It is smally, or not at all mountainous, except about <HI>Namurs, Luzenburg</HI> or <HI>He∣nault,</HI> It is fruitfull of corne, grasse and herbs, fit for pa∣sture for cattle, and medicine for health: yet in some places of <HI>Brabant</HI> and <HI>Gelderland</HI> full of heath, which notwith∣standing is not so barren, but cattle are fatted with the same, and their flesh hath an extraordinary sweet taste: It is free from those creatures, which are either noysome, or dangerous to man, and wanteth none of those blessings, wherewith the God of all blessing marketh a Countrey:

but a noble Prince, vnity of religion, and a quiet go∣uernment.</P>
<P>The Countrey of <HI>Limburck</HI> hath many names, and is a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Limburck.</NOTE> prouince full of villages, it containeth part of the Duke∣dome of <HI>Boloigne,</HI> the Marquisate of <HI>Franckmount,</HI> the Earledome of <HI>Haspengo</HI> and <HI>Lootes,</HI> with many other Baro∣nies. There are brought into the lists 24. great townes, amongst whom we begin <HI>inprimis</HI> with <HI>Leege,</HI> situated on the <HI>Mase,</HI> as hauing a Bishops See, a delicate castle, &amp; many well-ordred edifices: the dorps are reckned 1700. besides Abbayes and religious houses: toward the North adioy∣ning to <HI>Brabant,</HI> it flourisheth in corne &amp; hath some vines. Toward the South, neighbouring <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Lutzenburg:</HI> it is more barren, as intermingled with hils and woods, the remainder of that great forrest of <HI>Ardenia,</HI> of which so many fabulous accidents are recorded. It containeth di∣uers mines of marble and cole, and in such goodnesse of euerything, that a prouerb raiseth it selfe, to haue bread better then bread, fire hotter then fire, and iron harder then iron.</P>
<P>The Dukedome of <HI>Lutzenburg</HI> is for the most part mountainous and full of wood, in the rest well tilled, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lutzenburg</NOTE> where they haue stocked vp the trees, excellent ground: what neighboureth <HI>France</HI> conserueth both their language and customes, the rest speake Dutch. The names of the Prouince and principall City haue one sound, but it is ill diuided, part on a hollow by the riuer <HI>Essa,</HI> part on a rocky mountaine: so that it proposeth no great vniformity: but yet yeeldeth a gracefull obiect, and in retaining the autho∣rity of a Parliament, hath a preheminence of many greater and prouder townes. The next is <HI>Arlunum, quasi ara Lunae,</HI> as supposed, that they heere worshipped the Moone.
<PB N="126" REF="73"/>
The rest are sutable, some for strength, as <HI>Thion</HI> on the <HI>Mosell;</HI> some for commodity, as <HI>Baston,</HI> the mart of the Countrey, and adiacent to the forrest; and some for con∣tentment and orderly conueniency, as 26. others.</P>
<P>The countrey of <HI>Henault</HI> is sutable to the rest, and mar∣cheth with the same equipage of plenty and pleasure: the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Henault.</NOTE> cheefe cities are <HI>Mons</HI> and <HI>Valenciens.</HI> To <HI>Mons</HI> is attribu∣ted the precedency, for antiquity, strength and riches: yet is it almost neere the center of the Land, and on a little riuer called <HI>Trulla,</HI> whose visitation makes the common people wealthy and industrious, especially in weauing of a stuffe called Sayes, which heere exceede all the townes of the <HI>Low-Countries. Valenciens</HI> is better sited on the riuer <HI>Scal∣dis,</HI> and is very spacious, well walled, and full of ancient buildings, the Citizens are great trades-men, and gaine much by the making of fustians, the rest are brought into the account with the number of 22. Amongst whom <HI>Binchium</HI> might haue showne you a goodly palace, erected by <HI>Mary,</HI> sister to <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, and beautified with gar∣dens of pleasure to these vses. To beguile idle houres, to countenance a solitary retiring from the great encombran∣ces of the world, to quicken meditation with a correspon∣cency of time and place, and to inuite the body to a better aire, then commonly populous cities affoord, it was yet destroyed, some would faine say defaced, by <HI>Henry</HI> the se∣cond, King of <HI>France,</HI> in those times of desolation, when intestine mutinies could not be appeased without effusion of bloud, and the rage of Princes exasperated one another to sore reuenges.

The rest are <HI>Charlimont, Manburg,</HI> and <HI>Philips</HI> towne, wherein the first founders, or rather re-edifiers,
<PB N="127" REF="73"/>
made strong defences against the eruptions of the <HI>French,</HI> and were resolued to diuide the house of <HI>Burgundie</HI> for euer from the <HI>Flower-de-luce.</HI> Many other townes with the villages might be spoken of; but because there are few memorable things in them, I passe all ouer with such a slightnes, as is required in a man, that maketh haste out of an idle iourney, till he come to his place of rest, and better consequence.</P>
<P>The countrey of <HI>Artois</HI> did once absolutely belong to the <HI>Flower-de-luce,</HI> as by the antiquitie and scituation <NOTE PLACE="marg">Artois.</NOTE> may appeare: But afterward in the contract 1529, it was patible of diuision, when the Emperor and the French King were weighed in the ballance of successe to set forward the renowne of eithers preuailing; so that when <HI>France</HI> was found too light, in regard that the false hand of fortune turned the scale on tother side, twelue pretty townes fell from the King, as stones pull'd from a ruinous wall, leauing the whole Prouince in hazard of fal∣ling too, had not the other part of the countrey succor'd it selfe vnder the supportation of <HI>Picardy,</HI> and now tel∣leth vs of good corne, many riuers, much wood, and re∣porteth of the raining wooll by the testimonie of Saint <HI>Hierome,</HI> and others, who set it in the account of won∣ders.</P>
<P>The Prouince of <HI>Namurs</HI> is plentifull of all things, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Namurs.</NOTE> belongeth to the vse of man, as if the horne of <HI>Achelous</HI> were not onely reserued here for a monument, but distri∣buted abundance by reason of the vertue following the possession: it hath many iron and cole mines, of whose nature and condition this is obserued, that whereas other coales are extinguished with water, and enflamed with oyle; these are set on fire with water, and rebated in their

heat with oyle. It hath onely fowre walled Townes, who dare thus lift vp their heads aboue water to keepe the bo∣dies from sinking. 1. <HI>Namurs,</HI> scituated on the two ri∣uers <HI>Mosa</HI> and <HI>Scambra</HI> vnited by a well compacted bridge of stone, retayning a Bishops sea, and keeping the solem∣nitie of a Parliament. 2. <HI>Bouinum</HI> on the banke of <HI>Mosa,</HI> much defaced by the warres, being of late a rich, stately, and populous Citie. 3. The third is <HI>Charlemont,</HI> one of the strongest Castles in <HI>Europe,</HI> mounted on a high look∣ing rocke, whose foundation is washed by the riuer <HI>Gillet,</HI> and from the Emperor retaineth both glory and denomi∣nation. 4. The last is <HI>Vallencuria,</HI> whose etimology doth almost expresse it selfe: For here are all ciuill causes de∣termined, and the villages of the Prouince bring their controuersies to be decided.</P>

Ilands, which are environed with water, and knowne by 15 seuerall names, against whom the sea hath much pre∣uailed, and not long since with violent invndations swal∣lowed 300 of their inhabited townes; so that now you may saile by the steeples of Churches, and not knowing the reason, wonder to what purpose the Towres were so erected. There remaine now three principall, which are preserued against the rage of the Ocean with exceeding cost, and powerfull industry, namely <HI>Walcheren, Schouen,</HI> and <HI>South-Beueland:</HI> and foure inferior, <HI>Diuelant, Tolen, North-Beuelant,</HI> and <HI>Woolfersdike;</HI> which are graced with the prerogatiues of eight walled townes, whereof six continue their Estates Deputies for the whole County. <HI>Midelborough, Flushing, Camphere,</HI> and <HI>Armenden,</HI> which hath no voice, although it cry out neuer so loud, that it standeth with the rest in <HI>Walcheren.</HI> In <HI>Schouen, Si∣rexee,</HI> and <HI>Bucers</HI> hauen, which hath likewise no voice. In <HI>South-Beueland</HI> which is the greatest and fertilest Iland, the towne of <HI>Tergowse;</HI> and in the land of <HI>Tolen,</HI> the towne of <HI>Tertolen,</HI> and <HI>Martins dike,</HI> which hath also no voice. These Ilands are preserued by the downes, which be certaine bankes of sand cast vp with the tides, and where there are no sands, as toward the south, the dikes are raised by the industry of man, and proportioned with equall height to the rest; all so rammed with mats &amp; casses of fagots 6 or 7 foote long, that it not only performeth the effect of their securitie, but seemeth an artificiall gracefulnes, and being so neere <HI>England</HI> is worthy the ouer-viewing.

The cheefest trade of the inhabitants is nauigation, fishing, and making salt: yet within the land they imploy themselues to tillage, and feeding of cattle. The people doe so multiply and increase, that they are compelled to inlarge their Townes, as well for their owne inhabitants, as frequentation of strangers, who since the troubles of <HI>Antwerpe</HI> resort hi∣ther extraordinarily; but if I should adde the brauery of fortifications, I should do them no wrong, nay I might augment their glory: For <HI>Flushing</HI> is one of the stron∣gest Townes of <HI>Europe;</HI> and <HI>Midleborough</HI> so rampar∣ted and guarded, that a very militarie renowne is attri∣buted vnto them, and the Burgers themselues deserue well of all good reports.</P>

The villages or dorps are foure hun∣dred, amongst whom the stately county of the <HI>Hague</HI> ad∣uanceth her counteuance equall to a great city: for their court retaineth some shew of princilnesse, and the old pa∣lace maketh demonstration of those noble customes and hospitality, which the ancient Earles in their former power maintained; yet because it is vnwalled, neighbouring a pretty parke of fallow Deere, and inuiteth you to better re∣tired places, then the townes of hurliburly and continuall commerces accustome, it is reputed a Dorp, and seemeth much contented with her situation so remote from the forraine enemy of the State. <HI>Harlem</HI> with her spacious∣nesse is founded most delicately; for as soone as you are entred, the pleasure of a pretty wood inuiteth your abode, where the Citizen in the dayes of pastime make their ho∣nest conuersation, the strengthning of one anothers friend∣ship.

an Iland by the inundation of the sea, which with vngen∣tle violence (at that time) washed away whole fields of firme ground, and like a barren vnsatiate wombe, filled her paunch with aboue 200. villages: It is a beautifull long towne, and graced with the staple of Rhenish wine, corne and timber, brought in great, strange and long boats called <HI>Punts,</HI> which neuer goe backe againe, but serue in these ri∣uers as a receptacle of diuers families, and many people who haue no other dwelling then on shipboord, &amp; if you demand how they liue the voyage ended, &amp; maintain their estates when the first businesse is determined. They spin, fish, follow the league with prouision, carry corne and turffe from towne to towne, and are employed for the vse of bridges, to transferre whole armies ouer riuers; but to tell you that some of them are 160. foot long, and haue three or foure diuisions or houses in one boat, would raise a suspicion, and peraduenture make you smile at the ficti∣on, but admire the truth. <HI>Delft</HI> is so named of a ditch, cut out betweene it and the <HI>Hague,</HI> and is a sweet and pleasant towne, although the inhabitants are emploied for the most part about brewing, and spinning of wooll. <HI>Leyden</HI> boa∣steth of her antiquity, as deriuing her originall from the Legions of the Roman souldiers heere resident, when the custome of warre, and the coldnesse of winter did enforce them to garison, and orderly sequestration: it is now an Vniuersity, beautified with walkes of pleasure and magni∣ficence: yet cannot wash away the imputation of many trayterous reuolts and vnconstant resolutions against the gouernment of the <HI>States.

<HI>Holland</HI> exceedeth any countrey in the world, challenging no more circuit of ground, as may be ghessed by the yeere 1587. when there was 600. ships arrested in the <HI>Sont</HI> by the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and in 1588. it is well knowen, that in very short warning they supplyed vs with an hundred men of warre, as for <HI>Cales</HI> voyage, the third part of that Nauie was theirs: but if you looke further, in the West and East-Indies, in the hauens of <HI>Barbary</HI> and <HI>Affrick,</HI> in the <HI>Arches,</HI> and <HI>Constantinople,</HI> in the Gulph of <HI>Venice,</HI> and al∣most all the frequented places of the world, the <HI>Hollander</HI> aduentures, and is now a glorious Marchant and Mariner.

It is diuided into two parts by the riuer <HI>Amisia,</HI> which commeth downe by <HI>Embden: East Freesland</HI> challenging a particular preheminence and iurisdiction, as I sayd, by it selfe: and <HI>West Freesland</HI> suffering this partition, <HI>Ostergo,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Groining.</NOTE> <HI>Westergo, Transilana, Drenta, Tuenta,</HI> the seuen woods and Lordship of <HI>Groining,</HI> a beautifull towne and famous for that siege, wherein were 80000. in the field on both sides 1594. when Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> obtained it for the <HI>States,</HI> be∣ing before ouer-awed 1580. by the Duke of <HI>Parma.</HI> As it hath more cattle and pasture then other prouinces: so more villages, &amp; the inhabitants are more warlike, inso∣much, that commonly there is a Regiment or two of Fri∣zons in the army, when amongst the foot-companies there is scarse two hundred Dutch-men besides: yet haue they many troops of horse, and are distinguished by diuers cha∣racters, although they speake all one language, either high or Low-Dutch, as <HI>Resties, Lansguents, Frizons, Switzers, High-Germans, Dutch,</HI> and <HI>Free-booters,</HI> or <HI>Boot-halers.</HI></P>
<P>I haue insisted the longer on the discourse of these Pro∣uinces, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Low-Countries is lost by the Spanyard.</NOTE> because you may see the errours of selfe will and ill counsell, euen in the gouernment of mighty Monarchs, as I sayd before.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. <HI>The description of</HI> IRELAND.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE country and kingdome of IRELAND is generally for naturall aire, and commo∣ditie <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ireland.</NOTE> of blessings, sufficient to satisfie a couetous, or curious appetite: but withall diuided into such fastnes of mountaine, bogg, and wood, that it hath emboldned the inhabitants to presume on hereditary securirie, as if disobedience had a protection. For the mountaines de∣nie any cariages, but by great industry and strength of men (so haue we drawne the Cannon ouer the deepest boggs, &amp; stoniest hils) and the passages are euery way dan∣gerous, both for vnfirmenes of ground, &amp; the lurking re∣bell, who will plash downe whole trees ouer the paces, and so intricately winde them, or lay them, that they shall be a strong barracado, and then lurke in ambush amongst the standing wood, playing vpon all commers, as they in∣tend to goe along. On the bogg they likewise presume with a naked celeritie to come as neere our foote and horse, as is possible, and then flie off againe, knowing we cannot, or indeed dare not follow them: and thus they serue vs in the narrow entrances into their glins, and stony paths, or if you will dangerous quagmires of their moun∣taines, where a 100 shot shall rebate the hasty approch of 500; and a few muskets (if they durst carry any) well placed, will stagger a pretty Armie, not acquainted with the terror, or vnpreuenting the mischeefe.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="82"/>
The Prouince of LEMSTER is more orderly than <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lemster.</NOTE> the rest, as being reasonable well inhabited, and hauing some forme of a Common-wealth; so that I finde no mislike either for delight, or profit, but that the want of wood abridgeth their computation of happinesse; yet questionles was the principall cause of our reducing them to ciuilitie, and the place wherein we first setled many En∣glish families. Some vnite, and some diuide the king∣dome of <HI>Meth</HI> from <HI>Lemster,</HI> and make it a Prouince of it selfe, containing <HI>East-Meth, West-Meth,</HI> and <HI>Longford,</HI> wherein <HI>O Roorck</HI> is resident, supposing himselfe the greatest Gentleman in the world; yea contesting many times with <HI>Oneal,</HI> how euer with much adoe he afforded him precedencie: The countrey is very fruitfull and pleasant, not so mountanous, but ill inhabited: For the warres, and their owne bestialitie, haue not onely made a separation of all good order, but euen terrified both beast and fowle from commorance amongst them in many places.</P>
<P>The Prouince of MVNSTER hath some Townes well <NOTE PLACE="marg">Munster.</NOTE> aduanced by the sea coasts, and many excellent harbours, wherein <HI>Ireland</HI> may boast ouer all the countries of <HI>Eu∣rope:</HI> The grounds adiacent are very fertile, and in many places afford cause of ostentation; but more inward they are very barren and mountanous, full of boggs, wood, and other remote places, whose fastnes hath incited the people to ouer-great presumption: yet because of the spa∣tiousnes with men desiring good order, it might be redu∣ced and reformed, as enioying plentifull and sweet ri∣uers, full of fish, and some of sufficient depth to transport reasonable boates into the land.</P>
<P>The Prouince of CONACH is diuided from the rest by a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Conach.</NOTE>
<PB N="146" REF="83"/>
goodly riuer called the <HI>Shanon,</HI> being as I take it the grea∣test of any Iland in the world: For it fetcheth a course of 200 mile, and filleth his channell along the shores of <HI>Longford, Meths, Ormond, Limrick,</HI> and <HI>Kerry,</HI> yet serueth them in no great stead: For their shipping commeth no further, than <HI>Limrick,</HI> where it is fiue mile broad fresh water, and 60 mile from the maine sea, from thence small cotts, as they tearme their boates, carry their wood, turff, fish, and other commodities: but for fish, as Salmon, Breame, Pike, and diuers other sorts, I shall not be be∣leeued to relate the numbers, and hugenes, by such as are enemies to obseruation, or the beleefe of the blessings of other countries. Within 20 mile of <HI>Limrick,</HI> as I take it, a litle beyond, the praecinct of <HI>Caher-Castle</HI> a strange rock hath taken her lodging euen crosse the riuer, and filleth the roome in such a manner, that almost the nauigation is hin∣dred thereby: but what cannot men and money doe? and why should not these idle people be industriously im∣ployed to remoue the same, &amp; so free the passage to <HI>Ath∣lone:</HI> As for an obiection of impossiblitie; the iudgement of men hath yeelded to suruey, and many examples haue confirmed the effects of more laborious attempts. The south part, namely <HI>Tomond,</HI> (for by reason of the riuers in∣terposing it selfe I see no reason why it should be disioin∣ted from <HI>Conach)</HI> with <HI>Galloway</HI> and <HI>Clenricard</HI> is very sto∣nie, full of marble, alablaster, and iett, and hath better order both for number and good building in their Castles, than other parts of <HI>Ireland:</HI> The north from <HI>Athlone</HI> to the Abbey of <HI>Aboile,</HI> and so beyond the <HI>Curlewes</HI> as farre as <HI>Slego,</HI> is of excellent temperature and goodnesse: These <HI>Curlewes</HI> are mountaines full of dangerous passa∣ges, especially when the <HI>Kern</HI> take a stomach and a pride

to enter into action, as they terme their rebellion and tu∣multuary insurrections. On the other side the County of <HI>Maio</HI> consorteth with the pleasingest place in the King∣dome, by whose beaten banks lye those famous <HI>Ilands of life,</HI> of whom a ridiculous tale is fathered, that nothing dies in them, so that when the inhabitants grow old, they are caried else where, which custome they haue of late su∣perstitiously obserued both in these Ilands of <HI>Aran,</HI> and some other adioyning of the same condition, as they suppose.</P>
<P>The Prouince of VLSTER, and called the <HI>North</HI> is <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ulster.</NOTE> very large, and withall mountanous, full of great Loughs of fresh water, except <HI>Lough Cone,</HI> which ebbeth and flow∣eth, as the Sea shouldreth aside the streites at <HI>Strangford,</HI> and with that violence at the ebb, that a ship vnder saile with a reasonable gale of winde cannot enter against the tide. These lakes nature hath appointed in steed of riuers, and stored with fish, especially Trowt, and Pike, of such strange proportion, that if I should tell you of a Trowt taken vp in <HI>Tyrone</HI> 46 inches long, and presented to the <HI>L: Montioy,</HI> then Deputie: you would demand, whether I was <HI>oculatus testis,</HI> and I answer, I eat my part of it, and as I take it both my <HI>L: Dauers,</HI> and <HI>Sir William Goodolphin</HI> were at the table, and worthy <HI>Sir Iosias Bodley</HI> hath the portraiture depicted <HI>in plano.</HI> Here are no Townes, or at least very few, but diuers Castles dispersed, and the inhabitants remoue their cabbins, as their cattle change pasture, somewhat like the <HI>Tartarians,</HI> except in times of warre, and troubles, then doe they retire vnder the couett of Castles, and order their houses wonde with rods, and couered with turffs, as well as they can, bringing their cat∣tle euen within their houses, lying altogether in one roome

both to preuent robberies of <HI>Kern,</HI> and spoile by Wolues. Amongst these euery country is subiect to the Law <HI>Tanist,</HI> which is, he which is best able to maintaine the reputation of their familie, is the great O, and commander.</P>
<P>Through the Kingdome generally the winter is neither so cold, nor the summer so hot as in <HI>England,</HI> by reason whereof Haruest is very late, and in the North wheat will not quickly ripen, nor haue they acornes once in a dozen yeere: their principall corne is oates, which are com∣monly burnt out of the straw, and then trod from the husks with mens feete; of this they make their bread in cakes, being first grownd by calliots and drudges very na∣ked, and beastly sitting on the ground, with the mill like our mustard quernes betweene their legs, and then vpon broad yron presses they bake the meale when it is knea∣ded; which custome the best obserue in <HI>Munster</HI> with their cheefest corne. The continuall showers and mists make the countrey more dangerous to our Nation, debar∣ring the absolute assurance of wholesome aire, and the consequent health: seldome any frost continues, or snow lieth long, but on the mountaines, in which are great store of Deere both red &amp; fallow. The abundance of Wolues compels them to house their cattle in the bawnes of their Castles, where all the winter nights they stand vp to the bellies in durt: another reason is, to preuent theeues, and false-harted brethren, who haue spies abroad, &amp; will come 30 mile out of one Prouince into another to practise a cunning robbery. The people are generally haters of bondage, and beyond measure proud: so that the yonger brothers, and bastards, who are as deare as the other, scorne all endeuours, but liberty and warre. The Gen∣tlewomen stomach, and in truth vilipend others, who get
<PB N="149" REF="84"/>
their liuing by trade, merchandice, or mechanically: yet are diuers Grauers in gold and siluer, called plaine tinkers, who make their challices, harpes, buttons for their sleeues, crucifixes, and such like, in estimation amongst them. Their Noblemen, or Lords called <HI>Dynastas,</HI> are knowne by <HI>O</HI> and <HI>Mac,</HI> and euery familie hath such as minister iustice to the people, famoused by the title of <HI>Breahans,</HI> and yet the exactions ouer their tenants by way of cut∣tings, and other terrible impositions, haue caused diuers rebellions and insurrections amongst themselues, which when the State hath attempted to reforme, then haue they stood on their guard, and taken indirect occasions to con∣demne our vsurpation, whereby their odious and hatefull repinings, like a menstruous cloth, haue made their disobe∣dience loathsome, and brought vpon them such miseries, as a calamitous warre and angry Prince inflicteth turbu∣lent people withall. These families haue also such, as by way of historie elate them to exorbitant actions, ioyning withall the abuse of Poetry, and deceit of Physicke, knowne by the name of <HI>Bardes,</HI> on whom depend cer∣taine harpers, rymers, and Priests, which liue in a kinred, the father instructing the sonne, or brother, and he his cosin, or friend. The name of <HI>Galliglas</HI> is in a manner extinct, but of <HI>Kern</HI> in great reputation, as seruing them in their reuolts, and prouing sufficient souldiers, but ex∣cellent for skirmish. They haue strong and able bodies, proud hearts, pestilent wits, liberall of life, subiect to in∣continency, amorous, wherein their women are extraor∣dinarily pleased, patient to endure, louers of musicke, and hospitalitie, constant to their maintainers, whether men or women, implacable in their hatred, light of beleefe, co∣uetous of glory, impatient of reproch, or contumelie;
<PB N="150" REF="85"/>
not thinking it yet any disgrace to receiue a nickname at their christning, as <HI>Con Oneale banco,</HI> because hee was lame. Besides, they are all extreamely superstitious, as indeed barbarous people are best obseruers of ceremo∣nies, and when any of them enters into religion, it is ad∣mirable with what austeritie they reforme themselues: Their children are nursed abroad, and their foster-fathers and foster-mothers are as deare to them, as their owne kinred: They vse incantations and spells, wearing girdles of womens haire, and locks of their louers; they suppose idlenes a glory of nature, and by their sluttish, or rather sa∣uage customes striue to scorne (as they say) our superflui∣tie: They are ready vpon any inforcement by the impo∣sturing Art of their <HI>Bardes</HI> to innovation, as enuying our first conquest, and stomaching they were neuer able to expell vs: They are desperate in reuenge, and their <HI>Kerne</HI> thinke no man dead, vntill his head be off: They suppose theft no great offence, as imitating the <HI>Lacedemonians;</HI> for they pray to prosper in their attempts: but these be com∣monly the bastards of Priests, who proue notorious vil∣laines, and the daughters either begg or become strum∣pets, or if you will, beggerly strumpets. They common∣ly intermix othes with their speeches, as by the Trinitie, God, his Saints, S<SUP>t</SUP> Patrick, S<SUP>t</SUP> Briget, faith, and troth, the Temple, your hand, O Neales hand, and such like. Their mariages are strange; for they are made sometimes <NOTE PLACE="marg">I haue knowne of them deliue∣red in the morning &amp; march along with vs the same d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>.</NOTE> so conditionally, that vpon a slight occasion the man ta∣keth another wife, the wife another husband: They are easily deliuered of their children, and if they haue any by diuers men, at their deaths they resigne them to the right father; the new maried and conceiued with childe giueth the <HI>Barde</HI> her best clothes: They haue soft and excellent

skins and hands: but the small of their leggs hangeth in a manner ouer their brogs: Their apparrell is a mantle to sleepe in, and that on the ground on some rushes or flags: a thicke gathered smocke with wide sleeues graced with bracelets and crucifixes about their necks: They weare linnen rowles about their heads of diuers fashions: in <HI>Vlster</HI> carelesly wonde about: in <HI>Conach</HI> like Bishops miters, a very stately attire, and once prohibited by Sta∣tute: in <HI>Munster</HI> resembling a thicke Chesshire cheese. Their smocks are saffrond against vermine; for they weare them three moneths together; but to be lowsie is hereditarie with the best of them, and no disgrace. Both men and women not long since accustomed a sauage manner of dyet, which was raw flesh, drinking the blood, now they seeth it, and quaff vp the liquor, and then take <HI>Vsquebath:</HI> not hauing flesh they feede on <HI>Watercresses, Shamrocks,</HI> and <HI>Bonniclaboch,</HI> which is milke strangely put into a tub a sowring, till it be clodded, and curded toge∣ther: when the Cow wiil not let her milke downe they blow her behinde very strangely, and sometimes thrust vp their armes to their elbowes, speaking words of gentle∣nes and intreaty by way of bemoning. The men weare trowses, mantle, and a cap of steele; they are curious a∣bout their horses tending to witchcraft; they haue no saddles, but strange fashioned pads, their horses are for the most part vnshod behinde: they vse axes, staues, broad swords, and darts: In <HI>Terconnell</HI> the haire of their head growes so long and curled, that they goe bare-hea∣ded, and are called <HI>Glibs,</HI> the women <HI>Glibbins.</HI> These and many other doe the meere Irish obserue with resolu∣tion and our wonderment not to be diuerted, as if the Poet should finde fault with

penitent, and true conuertist.

Then was <HI>Salomon</HI> in his royalty, when his owne palace was finished after thirteene yeeres labours of 160000. worke-men, to which he brought his wife, euen <HI>Pharaohs</HI> daughter: when hee was aduanced on a throne of iuory and gold, and caused a seat to bee placed for the Kings mother, &amp; rose to meet her, setling her on his right hand: when his throne had six steps, and twelue Lyons of gold, when all his drinking vessels were of gold, and siluer was nothing esteemed: when hee made two hundred tar∣gets, and three hundred shields of gold, a throne of preci∣ous stone, and couered the <HI>Ibony</HI> with the best gold: when his prouision for one day was 30. measures of fine floure, and 60. of meale, 10. fat oxen, and 20. out of the pastures, 100. sheepe, besides harts, buckes, bugles, and fat foule. Then was <HI>Salomon</HI> in his royalty, when he asked wisdom at the hands of God, and distributed equity to all his peo∣ple, when hee spake 3000. prouerbs, and 1000. songs, when he related the nature of trees, plants, beasts, fowle, fishes, and creeping things, when he appoynted the Offi∣cers of his houshold, and Commanders ouer Prouinces, first 3300. then 300. lastly 250. as Princes and principall ouer the other, when the Queene of <HI>Sheba</HI> came to prooue him with hard questions, and brought him odours, golde, and precious stones: when she saw his wisdome, the house he had built, the prouision of his table, the sitting of his seruants, the ordering of his ministers, and their apparrell, his drinking-vessels, and burnt offerings, when there came

of all people to heare his wisdome, when hee excelled all the Kings of the earth in riches, and administration of e∣quity, when hee blessed the people, and praised God in publike, giuing the Priests and Prophets liberty to main∣taine the cause of the Lord of hosts, and not permitting the corruption of the world to transferre them beyond the limits of true deuotion, and religious piety, and when he so ouer-looked &amp; ouer-awed all Officers of the King∣dome, that neither the mighty made their greatnesse a bar to descend to the practise of charitable actions, nor the better sort tooke ill example by the higher to practise vn∣befitting policy, or oppressions of the poore: nor the in∣feriour had cause of clamorous repinings, or tumultuary insurrections against the gouernment, abusing the people.</P>
<P>Then was <HI>Salomon</HI> in his royalty, when he had built ci∣ties of store, cities of chariots, cities for horse-men neere <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> when hee went in person to <HI>Hamah Zobah,</HI> and ouercame it, and re-edified <HI>Bethoran</HI> the vpper, and <HI>Betho∣ran</HI> the nether, cities defenced with walls, gates, and bars: when he built the cities of store in forraine parts, and wal∣led in all places expugned and depopulated by the wars of <HI>Saul</HI> and his father, or if you will, the house of <HI>Beniamin</HI> and <HI>Iuda,</HI> contending for the Diadem. When hee had 40000. stalls of horses for his chariots, 12000. horse-men for his guard, and fortified diuers places of garison, main∣taining martiall discipline, and by example of <HI>Dauids</HI> Princely rewarding men of merit, not permitting the ver∣tue of well-deseruers to mourne for want of acceptation. Then was <HI>Salomon</HI> in his royalty, when he built a nauy of ships by the red sea, when King <HI>Hiram</HI> sent him mariners, and they were entertained for their experience, industry, and knowledge: when they went to <HI>Ophir,</HI> and brought

and out of some experience, a hundred well trained and ordered souldiers will beat a thousand of them, especially if they can be first staggered with any vnacquainted sight, or strength; I meane our battalions of pikes, strong squa∣drons of horse, firme standings of muskets, and martiall cheerefulnesse from trumpets and drums: for they are presumptuous of nothing, but their bowes and arrowes, swiftnesse of horse-manship in pursuits, and running after preyes or spoiles, and clamorous noyse of horse, and mi∣serable out-cries: so that at one word, neither in warre or peace, they cannot be graced with one word of our exam∣ple, or <HI>Salomons</HI> happinesse. As for <HI>Tangut</HI> and <HI>Mangia,</HI> the very cause of his pride and elated titles, if there can be any pride in bestiality, or shew of magnificence in a Princes se∣questration from his people; they are mighty prouinces in∣deed, and extend to the circling about 1500.

with honest trauellers, that may tell them the truth, or at least instruct them in an arte of seeming probabilitie; as for example: in plaine honestie I wonder, how <HI>Munster</HI> that learned man, and famous <HI>Chronologer,</HI> could be so deceiued or abused to talke of <HI>Pigmeies,</HI> of men with long eares, and one foote, and such like?

Therefore (as I said) for my owne part, I disclaime them all, and either tye my selfe to my poore endeuours, or aduenture on such passages of ciuill authoritie, as come neere probabilitie and religion: onely in this I will play the truant with others, that as in vnknowne countries they fill vp the Map with gyants, beasts, monsters, and some strange battailes: and in wri∣ting of Chronicles they passe ouer the liues of their first Princes with only names, and peraduenture suppositions, because they would say some thing: so in these, or of these remote Nations, I will onely tell you what I haue seen my self in some cursory trauels, or learned of others, with whom by an Interpreter I haue of purpose entertai∣ned communication: As when I was in <HI>Turky</HI> I saw the Armie of the <HI>Tartars</HI> mustred by the fields of <HI>Scideret,</HI> and had the priuiledge of a <HI>Ianizarie</HI> to protect me from wrong, and be my interpreter for such things, as my wit and memory incited me to make vse of. At my <HI>L: Em∣bassadors</HI> againe I presumed on a conference with the <HI>Per∣sian Embassador,</HI> and as farre as my memory and vnder∣standing was capable of instruction, made benefit of some relations: and going to sea to <HI>Alexandria</HI> there were

both <HI>Indians, Iewes, Arabians,</HI> and <HI>Armenians</HI> aboord, from whom I catched what I could, supplying my desire of no∣uelties with their discourses: of whom concerning the purpose in hand, I learnt, that <HI>China</HI> was a great and oppu∣lent countrey in continuall warres with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> ielous one of another, and an enemy in the highest degree to all strangers, yea so farre from hospitalitie, and pious inclina∣tion to entertainment and commiseration, that they studie to circumuent their passengers, and come aboord with hypocriticall desire of satisfaction in nouelties, and then at aduantage either surprize the ships, or endanger the weaker company by ouer-mastring them, as many of our <HI>English</HI> both at the <HI>Philippines,</HI> and landing in <HI>Iapan</HI> haue had cause of testification: nor amongst themselues is there any such appearance of happines, or plenty.

If then in <HI>India,</HI> and the many countries and kingdomes marching vnder the flourishing colours of her prosperi∣tie, be as many filthy customes of incontinency, that they prostitute their daughters for money, and are contented to sell their chastitie for reward, nay in sundry places to bring their virgins before beastly idols, and cause them to fill their wombe with the <HI>priapus</HI> of the same, whereat, if so be the tender maide seemeth terrified, or ashamed, the mother shall stand behinde, and thrust her most violently forward: with diuers other lamentable customes tending to abomination: how can it come neere our example, when adultery was punished with death in <HI>Israel,</HI> and there was not a whore to be found (especially by tolera∣tion) amongst the daughters of <HI>Iuda?</HI> If then in <HI>India</HI> the Kings and Princes swell against one another with ty∣ranous ambition and reuenges, raising violent hostilitie against their neighbours and confederates, and practising horrible cruelty in their slaughters and victories: how can it come neere our example, when <HI>Salomon</HI> was deno∣minated the Prince of peace, and confirmed a league of amitie and confederation with all adioyning Princes?

bee sequestred from their people, to terrifie them with cruell lookes and imperious controuling, not to be seene abroad, but in times of feares and terrors, to deny them orderly accesse for their complaints and greeuances, and to liue, as commanding obedience by tyranny, rather than loue: How can it come neere our example, when <HI>Salo∣mon</HI> made a porch before his Pallace to determine the controuersies of his people in person; offred sacrifice in publike vpon an Altar, and for seuen daies feasted all com∣mers with cheerefulnes; admitted the harlots to plead before him; and aduanced his mother on a throne by his right side in the open view of the congregation, and proclaimed free audience and accesse for all commers, that had cause of complaint, and oppression? If then in <HI>India</HI> theft and intrusion by strong hand be common matters, and howeuer there is great punishment inflicted on offen∣ders in this kinde, as also in <HI>China,</HI> yet do they liue in con∣tinuall feare one of another, and the rich are hard-hearted against the poore, not onely suffering them to sterue with∣out releefe, but in a manner hastning their deaths by au∣thoritie, if either they grow aged, or impotent, and haue not of their owne to releeue their necessities: How can it come neere our example, when in <HI>Israel</HI> there was nei∣ther vagabond, or begger, no man durst remoue the marke in his neighbours field, no man oppressed his brother with vsury, and euen contrary families were entertained with mutuall entercourses; yea when nature came to chal∣lenge her due, and sent her harbinger death to demand the same, they brought the body to the graue in peace, and solemnized the exequies with a fashionable ceremonie? If then in <HI>India</HI> there is a maine want both of flesh, fish, and other prouision for the sustenance of man, especially

to feede any multitude, or satisfie the meaner sort of peo∣ple, who know not, what orderly feasting, and neighbour∣ly meetings meane: How can it come neere our exam∣ple, when <HI>Salomon</HI> spent 30 oxen, with infinite other acates euery day, and the people met in abundance, eating and drinking euery man vnder his vine &amp; fig tree, and sent pre∣sents and gifts to one another with mutuall conuersation &amp; reciprocall loue: If then in <HI>India</HI> neither are the Cities hansomly contriued, nor well furnished with houses, want ciuill gouernment, and administration of iustice, if the country villages are rude, and disordered, liuing in suspi∣tion of one another for spoile and robbery, if they faile in all comelines and morall fashioning themselues to han∣somnes, and good order: How can it come neere our ex∣ample, where <HI>Salomon</HI> reedified the Cities of store, the Ci∣ties of fortification, the Cities of refuge, the Cities of plea∣sure, when <HI>Salomon</HI> had his orderly officers of visitation, and gaue commandment to ouer-looke the manifold di∣sturbances of the kingdome, and redresse the same with a strong hand against the mighty &amp; insolent, and with a sup∣porting arme for the poore and afflicted?

But if you would be acquainted with the true condition of their tyranny &amp; imperiousnes, then looke vpon the new admission of their Emperours, into the sublime chaire of Maiesty, and you shall heare him commanding all his brethren to bee strangled before him, except one; reserued, if the time allow it, for propagation of children, who likewise vpon the <HI>Turkes</HI> suppliment that way, shall miscarry by one meanes or other: yea, some∣times it happens, that when the aged father, or eldest bro∣ther is contented to admit of his sonne or yonger to the coparcinary of administration, or if you will, absolute power in the Empire, by reason of impotency, age, luna∣cy, or other naturall defects, they are most inhumanly re∣warded with death, as <HI>Zelimus</HI> poysoned his father <HI>Baia∣zet,</HI> and the sonnes of <HI>Soliman</HI> the <HI>Magnificent</HI> shouldred one another into the pit of destruction.</P>

confessing that <HI>Mordecai</HI> had not bin rewarded; but secret politicians supplied the roome, intimating still and still matter against him, which kindled the fire of the Empe∣rors ielousie to such a blaze, that nothing but his personall appearance could quench the same.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Viceer</HI> perceiued the danger of such ouer∣watchings, and began to be acquainted with too many princely messages, he absented himselfe a while, and with dilatory excuses laid as it were open his suspition of the Emperors ielousie against him, whereupon followed an obstinate deniall of comming, lest the affaires of the king∣domes might be intermitted; and when that serued not the turne, he determined to stand on his guard, till at last the <HI>Gran Signeur</HI> was aduised not to regard him at all: whereupon the <HI>Mufti</HI> was called to councell, which is their principall Churchman, who together with diuers Doctors of their law resolued, that he was too dangerous to liue, and yet policie must be vsed in cutting him off: When the foundation of this building was laid, letters were contriued from the <HI>Prince</HI> vnto him deceitfully im∣porting thus much: That he had great cause to be thank∣full to the great Prophet <HI>Mahomet</HI> for his indulgent care ouer the house of <HI>Ottoman,</HI> euen in these suspitious times to prouide, that a man of such courage, wisdom, and mag∣nanimity gouerned the sterne of the ship of his affaires, &amp; like a discreet pilot knew how to conduce the barke of the Common-wealth to safe harbour. He accordingly assumeth the glory to himselfe, with full resolution, that either the yong Prince durst not finde fault, or nothing was fault-worthy, like <HI>Aesops</HI> asse, who supposed, that the Lyon would be terrified with his braying. For at last he came to the Emperors presence into the <HI>Seralio,</HI> who was
<PB N="183" REF="98"/>
taught to entertaine him with a politicall acceptation, which lasted a while, and with the continuance of 14 daies seemed to wipe out the print of former vnkindnes: But when the day of his fatall destruction approched, (after the yong Prince had bin a hawking, and meeting with cer∣taine inhabitants of <HI>Bogdonia,</HI> and the borders of <HI>Russia,</HI> who made petition vnto Him for diuers redresses, gaue them a kinde of audience) hee was sodenly sent for to a priuate conference, which he verily supposed, according to some speciall inferences, tended to that purpose: nor did he once rebate the glory of his former iollity, but went at least with 300 <HI>Ianisaries,</HI> and his other officers toward the gates of the <HI>Seralio,</HI> where by the way the <HI>Haga</HI> or <HI>Captaine</HI> of the <HI>Ianisaries</HI> met him to tell him, how the Prince was retired to a <HI>Caska</HI> by the sea side, and he must goe through the garden, and enclosure of Roe-bucks vn∣to him, which he performed accordingly, and neuer seem∣ed once staggering in his resolutions, till he came to the yron gate, and saw his company prohibited to enter, and the gate fast barred, as soone as he was admitted.</P>
<P>Here he must needs passe through a guard of <HI>Capogies,</HI> who demanded his <HI>Semiter,</HI> which he furiously denied, and with increase of rage and choller railed vpon them all. But they being too well instructed to forbeare any such opprobrious speeches, spared a reply of words, and tooke an opportunitie to ouer-master him with the company, who most cruelly cut him all to peeces: yet some would raise the Emperors ielousie from a suspition of loue to his mother, who taking a fitting opportunitie, as was imagi∣ned, came with him to admonish her sonne from his <HI>pede∣rastria,</HI> or accompanying with boyes, but belike they per∣formed it with vnseasonable wisdome; for in his furie he

spurned her away, and bad him remember, he was but a slaue. Some report that the first motiue of the <HI>Emperors</HI> displeasure was occasioned by reason of his buildings, which ouer-looking some priuate walkes in the <HI>Seralio,</HI> was both irkesome to the maiestie of the <HI>Prince,</HI> and a dore to let in his euerlasting hate, to which there wanted not the seuerall suggestions of many flatterers, and tem∣porizers. But let his death, and the cause be what it will, there is no gaine-saying their wilfulnes, nor moderating their rage and tyrannie, witnes his fathers killing of his elder brother, a Prince of great expectation: but comming one day (though he did it with reuerence and teares in his eyes) to put him in remembrance of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> glory, and inlarging the Empire, which euery Prince had done sauing himselfe, the admonition was so vnsauoury, or the ielousie of his vertues so forcible, that he beat him to death with his owne hands, to the amase of all the Iani∣saries and soldiers: insomuch that the grandmother, a woman of excellent parts, who is yet liuing, had like to haue perished in the hurly-burly. To which may be ad∣ded, this yong Princes dislike of one of his Concubines, whom he shot to death in his gardens. I could here in∣sert many other stories of their cruelty, and tyrannous supplanting one another, murthering <HI>Bashawes,</HI> destroying <HI>Princes,</HI> and letting loose the streames of all rage, wilfull∣nes, and distemperature: but you will say I gleane but out of anothers haruest, and time is too pretious to spend it in idle relations, I will therefore leaue you to the origi∣nall, and only for the strangenes make a breuiate of <HI>Mu∣stapha's</HI> tragedy, who was so cruelly murthered by an in∣temperate Prince, intoxicatedby the cunning of a mali∣tious strumpet.</P>

<HEAD>The famous historie of <HI>MVSTAPHA.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>SVltanus Soliman</HI> surnamed the <HI>Magnificent,</HI> amongst <NOTE PLACE="marg">The lamen∣table trage∣dy of Mu∣stapha.</NOTE> many others had one beautifull Concubine called <HI>Rozza,</HI> or <HI>Roxalana,</HI> but more properly <HI>Hazathia,</HI> on whom he so doted in his later times, that all amarous dal∣liance with the rest was neglected for her sake, as if plea∣sure and delight attended her, though shee were but his slaue. Thus he so followed the humors of this wanton woman, that at last the noble Prince <HI>Mustapha</HI> his eldest sonne was prohibited his presence, and his former chil∣dren slightly regarded, in respect of hers: which when shee had fully apprehended, and politikely entertained, the next businesse was to make vse of the same, yea such vse, as cunning fauourites, and newly aduanced officers con∣triue, who suspecting some sudden alteration, and percei∣uing the Prince cannot last long, care not by what meanes they enrich themselues, and many times runne in the race of indirect courses to establish their hopes.</P>
<P>Wherevpon shee wonde vp her wilfulnes on the pesti∣lent bottome of <HI>Rustan Bashawes</HI> ambition, who had ma∣ried her daughter, and hauing likewise corrupted the principall <HI>Mufti</HI> to second her enterprise, they all com∣bined a league of amitie, and proiected to cast the Empire on her owne sonnes: which was no sooner ratified, and confirmed betweene them, but on a sudden shee became very deuout, and being rich with the fauours and presents bestowed vpon her, proposed a meritorious worke for her soules health by erecting some religious monument or <HI>Mosque,</HI> which was intercepted by the high Priest, as
<PB N="186" REF="100"/>
discouering the invaliditie of the same, because shee was yet a slaue, and therefore laboured in a busines, whose me∣rit and effects must tend to the good of another. This caused such a dissimiled pensiuenes, that <HI>Soliman</HI> himselfe was in a manner exanimated to behold the darling of the world in such a confusion and heauines: shee againe well lessond how to act her part, filled the scene with teares of disconsolation, related all occurrences from the begin∣ning, and finely vrged, how her godly zeale had certaine obstacles, which must be remoued, ere her former alacrity could gaine the field of this sullen meditation and vnto∣ward sadnes: whereupon the Doctors and Interpreters of the <HI>Alcaron</HI> were sent for, and commanded to deliuer the truth without praeuarication, who thus animated, dis∣couered the secret most plainely, and with impudent asse∣uerations concluded, that she had iust cause to complaine, &amp; insist on the meanes to procure her redress, which made such impression into the ouer-worne heart, and easily-per∣swaded disposition of the <HI>Emperor,</HI> that he presently ma∣numitted hir, &amp; by sound of trumpet proclaimed her free∣dome, and so cheered her, that he might the better reioyce in her company. But when shee had thus raised her selfe vpright vpon the honorable steps of liberty, shee stood vpon higher termes, and was not ashamed to assure him there was another lesson to be taken out, than now to dally with her as his slaue: for being free it was against the law of <HI>Mahomet</HI> to be commanded as a strumpet, and therefore, how euer he could dispence with religion, and ouer-awe the same, shee would not, nor durst betray her soule, as a delinquent in such impiety: yet she prostrated her life before him, and was ready to yeeld her necke to the blocke, if so it pleased him to inforce it. Here againe
<PB N="187" REF="100"/>
were the Doctors summoned, who maintained her cause, and with exceeding admiration at her piety and zeale fell humbled on the ground before him, with request not to cast her headlong to destruction, and damne her soule for euer, which so enflamed him, as <HI>Nititur inuetitum,</HI> that without looking aduisedly on the pretended mischiefe, and searching too narrowly in the closet of her deuises, in a foolish passion he solemnely married her.</P>
<P>This is that she long expected, and raising her thoughts with her fortunes, after much variety and infinite passages <NOTE PLACE="marg">Looke the Commenta∣ry, and Let∣tere de prin∣cipe in Ita∣lian.</NOTE> in the Common-wealth, she now studied nothing but the aduancement of her family; which could not be done vntil the worthy Prince <HI>Mustapha</HI> his eldest sonne by a former wife was thrust into a slaughter house, she quickly brought him into the danger of suspition (for euen good Princes are iealous in points of soueraignty) and cunningly in∣ferred, that she affected not his popular loue, his great concurses, his strengthning of <HI>Amasia,</HI> his entertaining of Embass: from <HI>Tartary,</HI> his taking vp such beautifull virgins out of <HI>Georgia</HI> and <HI>Mengrelia,</HI> with diuers other probabi∣lities, that he determined a present enlarging of his great∣nesse: which was as quickly apprehended; as politickely vrged, and nothing could satisfie the Emperor, but the present sending for <HI>Mustapha,</HI> who although he was fore∣warned of the mischiefe, and aduised to stand on his guard with full resolution, that the army was firme vnto him: yet remembring it was his father commaunded, and how obedience was a duty befitting a sonne; but principally laying a firme foundation on a cleare conscience, and an vncorrupt heart, he came to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> but was wel∣comed as Husbandmen doe their cattle into pleasant fields for to make them the more fit for the Butcher.

<HEAD>The Story of a Rennegado Bashaw.</HEAD>
<P>IN the raigne of <HI>Amurath</HI> the third this mans father there was a certaine Rennegado Dutchman aduanced to the dignitie of a Bashaw; for so they call Christians, who ab∣iure their religion at mans estate, and are circumcised ac∣cording to the Law of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> Where by the way you must consider of that mischieuous position not to dispute of either law, gouernment, or ceremonies of their religion, but absolutely allow of the great Prophet, and the Alca∣ron as infallible verity, wherein the Romane Byshoppes tread the same measures, and interdict any man from cal∣ling their actions in question, not suffering vs to read the Canon of Gods law, nor once dispute in matters of faith, but to confirme the power of the Church as of sufficiency to direct vs in the way of truth: a most diuellish, and re∣pugnant conclusion against God and his word, who com∣maundes vs to search the Scriptures, and try the spirits.
<PB N="189" REF="101"/>
But to our Story. This Bashaw liuing in great pompe to the outward show, seemed yet much excruciated in minde with meditation on the latter iudgement, and the sauing of his soule, whereupon he communed with one of his principall slaues to the same purpose, admitting all free∣dome of speech, and animating him so farre to deliuer his opinion, that at last hee attempted his patience in this sort. Sir you know, or at leastwise should know, that God at the first did chuse vnto himselfe a people called the Iewes, giuing them a law, priesthood, and Prince named <NOTE PLACE="marg">The doctrin of the Der∣uices or mendicant Priests of Turkie.</NOTE> <HI>Moses,</HI> who questionlesse is the Mediator still in heauen for honest Iewes imploring his assistance on earth; but when this wretched people despised the blessings of so great a God, falling to idolatry, and other horrible abuses, they were cast out of fauour, and vanished like smoake, or if you will, resembled, water spilt on the ground neuer to be gathered vp againe. Then did God select another nation called Christians, and admitted of their worthy acknow∣ledgement of Iesus Christ, whom they suppose God and man, and borne of a Virgin, and in whom still the good Christian beleeueth; this caused their increase of wealth, maiesty, and greatnesse, till at last growing wanton with prosperitie, they tooke the same or worse courses with the Iewes, and by degrees became flat Apostates, so that God was weary of them likewise, &amp; gaue a third nation power to thrust them from their firmenesse, and disiointed their established foundation of religion, and happinesse: which was acted by the hands of Turkes, who succeeded them, and had likewise their Prophet <HI>Mahomet</HI> to instruct and direct them to loue the great God of heauen more religiously than the others, from whose supportation the maiesty you now behold, spreadeth the wings of glory
<PB N="190" REF="102"/>
ouer the imperiall Citties both of Iewes, and Christians, namely, <HI>Ierusalem</HI> and <HI>Constantinople:</HI> nay, if you looke into <HI>Asia,</HI> we haue <HI>Tauris</HI> and <HI>Babilon;</HI> and in <HI>Egipt</HI> pos∣sesse <HI>Cairo</HI> or <HI>Memphis,</HI> and <HI>Alexandria:</HI> so that no doubt we shall multiply blessing vpon blessing, if wee continue confident toward him, and his elected Prophet; other∣wise some strange and barbarous nation shall expell and extirpate vs, as we haue vsurped ouer others. Thus then you see with what successe these three religions haue bin caried in the current of estimation both with God and man; namely the Iewes, who haue <HI>Moses</HI> to make inter∣cession for them: The Christians, who haue IESVS their Mediator; and Mahumetans, who depend vpon the me∣rits and exaltation of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> But for you, that are of no religion, nay, haue denied the faith, wherein you were borne and baptised, there is sure no redemption, but the Deuill himselfe to fetch you away. Which answere was so distasting, although as you heard, it went vnder safe conduct, that the tyrannous Lord not onely commaun∣ded him to be broken on a wheele to shiuers, but inflicted many Christian slaues in his house with the like punish∣ment, and thus much for their crueltie amongst them∣selues: now you shall see their behauiour toward Stran∣gers.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Their manner of aduancement, and diuersitie of customes farre from our example, and orderly prosperitie.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>Vr former allegations haue maintain∣ed, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Turkish gouernment deficient in exemplary goodnesse, or happines.</NOTE> that the Turkish Empire is cor∣roborated by the absolute will of the Prince, and wretched duty of the subiect; for he pulleth downe and aduanceth whom he pleaseth, and without sense or reason debar∣reth any man from pleading in his owne behalfe, or contesting with authoritie, if so be, he will not haue it so; otherwise, there is a certaine shadow of vprightnesse amongst them; an approaching to honor by degrees, and spreading the faire colours of some good customes, though farre short of our example: all which in in this Chapter shall be for diuers reasons enlarged. You must then consider, that euery second or third yeare his Officers range ouer all his kingdomes, and territories for slaues, Moores, and Eunuchs, but especially for the beau∣tifullest and handsommest children they can finde, being all the sonnes and daughters of Christians, who accor∣dingly are brought into his seuerall <HI>Seralios</HI> by 20. and 30000. at a time, and there from their infancy instructed in the Law of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> circumcised, and disposed of with∣out

knowledge of parents, friends, or countrey, except some Eunuch or Keeper out of meere commiseration discouer the same; so that all his Concubines, Wiues, Officers, and souldiers are the off-springs of Christians depending immediately on the Princes Exchequer, and pensions, not acknowledging other God, other law, other religion, other King, other Benefactor, or other life (ex∣cept in the story of <HI>George Castriot,</HI> who rebelled against him, after he knew his father was a Christian, and King of <HI>Epirus,</HI> which we may briefly runne ouer thus. When <HI>Amurath</HI> the 2. had conquered <HI>Epirus,</HI> with many other places of <HI>Seruia, Bulgaria,</HI> and <HI>Albania,</HI> he tooke prisoners <NOTE PLACE="marg">The story of Scanderbeg, and why he was so cal∣led.</NOTE> with him to <HI>Adrinopolis</HI> the King, and fiue of his sonnes, whom he tormented most barbarously vpon some dis∣tasting reply of the old Prince by putting out their eyes, and at last strangling them, except the youngest named <HI>George,</HI> whom he so fancied in his infancie, that he present∣ly circumcised him, instructed him in the Law of <HI>Maho∣met,</HI> and kept him secure in his owne pallace, vntill a mighty Champion of <HI>Persia</HI> made a challenge to fight with any Turke for the honour of both Empires hand to hand, starknaked, and with single <HI>Semiters:</HI> wherein as the motiue might be honourable enough, so the manner seemed ridiculous; yet so formidable, that for three daies together he insulted round about the Court without a daring answerer, or any man who durst take the matter in hand; at last this <HI>George Castriot</HI> out of some diuine inspi∣ration, and generous spirit, stepped foorth in the presence of the Emperour, not fully 18. yeere old, and without procrastinating the matter, stripped himselfe before them, and made them as much amazed at the beautifulnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>, and comelinesse of his person, as greatnesse of courage, and

shaking his sharp and glistring curtelax triumphantly ouer his head, approached the <HI>Persian,</HI> who by this time was prepared to the encounter, and in lesse then one quarter of an houres trauersing the ground, closed with him, wrastled with him, stradled ouer him like a <HI>Colossus,</HI> after hee had layd him on his backe, and strucke off his head: for which hee was presently embraced in his sweat by the great Em∣perour, inuested with a robe of honour, proclaimed by the sound of a trumpet <HI>Scanderbeg, quasi Alexander Mag∣nus,</HI> and aduanced to the dignity of <HI>Generall</HI> of the army: Therfore I wonder at their ignorance, or slender enforma∣tion, which haue published in print, that it was a name of scorne and derision; when we neuer read of so famous an action, and so high a recompence, wherein hee proceeded more and more, with loue of the army and regard of the Prince, till indeed an <HI>Eunuch,</HI> rauished with his worthi∣nesse, discouered what he was, and opened at large his fa∣thers story vnto him, whereat hee startled, as it were con∣founded, and neuer desisted, till he had perswaded the ar∣my to reuolt, and so obtained his Kingdome, making war against the <HI>Turke</HI> seuenteene yeere together, as in the lar∣ger stories may appeare. But to the businesse in hand.</P>
<P>The naturall <HI>Turke</HI> they call <HI>Muscellman,</HI> and he seldom comes to preferment: but liues as a trades-man in cities, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The degrees of the Turks</NOTE> husbandman in the countrey, or mariner at sea: yet, for the most part, are all your gally-slaues Christians, and o∣uerlooked by the cruell eyes of hard-hearted masters, the rest cast vp their account in this manner. At the begin∣ning they are called <HI>Gimoglanes,</HI> or <HI>Azamoglanes,</HI> resem∣bling <NOTE PLACE="marg">1</NOTE> poore hospitall-boyes, doing all manner of drudge∣ry, both in court &amp; the houses of <HI>Bashawes,</HI> and are known by a plaine habit and strange hat on their head, which is a
<PB N="201" REF="107"/>
felt like a suger-loafe, of a maiden-haire colour.</P>
<P>The second degree is of <HI>Ianizaries,</HI> whose <HI>Haga</HI> or Cap∣taine is a most honourable, though dangerous place. Of <NOTE PLACE="marg">2</NOTE> these be two sorts: of the court, limited in their numbers; and at large without restraint, as alwaies mustred for chiefe souldiers in the army: yea, as (a man may say) the principall beame of the whole Empires frame. For from their suffrages and obedience, the <HI>Gran Signeur</HI> is confir∣med: from their repinings, disorders are multiplied: from their partiality, a sonne deposeth a father: and from their mutinies confusion riseth, and like a swelling sea casteth downe the bankes of all gouernment.</P>
<P>The third sort are <HI>Capogies,</HI> employed as porters of gates, purseuants on errands, attenders on the <HI>Viceers,</HI> as <NOTE PLACE="marg">3</NOTE> they sit at meat in their great <HI>Dowana's,</HI> which be open hals trauersed, as occasion shall serue with Persian hangings, and sometimes trusted with secret murthers, and such like dangerous businesse.</P>
<P>The fourth place is appropriate to the <HI>Spahyes,</HI> who are inferiour horse-men, with high fethers in their strange fa∣shioned <NOTE PLACE="marg">4</NOTE> hats, somewhat more glorious then the <HI>Ianizaries,</HI> their arming, as also the <HI>Ianizary,</HI> keepes some correspon∣dency with the <HI>Persian.</HI> On foot, either bow and arrowes, and a semiter, or hargabush and a semiter: on horse-backe the very same, with addition of a shield made of sinewes, or the barke of an Indian tree, cast behinde at their backs, with addition of a pollax, hatchet, or iron mace, which are made like scepters: but, for the most part, none pre∣sumes to weare them vnder the degree of a <HI>Chiaus,</HI> who haue them in the city of siluer for shew, and of steele for execution.</P>
<P>The fift roome is supplyed by the <HI>Chiaus,</HI> a degree of <NOTE PLACE="marg">5</NOTE>
<PB N="202" REF="108"/>
honourable eminence and may ranke with our <HI>Barons.</HI> For they ride in veluet gownes, siluer-plated saddles, costly stirrups, and rich turbanes: with these I may almost equall the Captaines of castles, forts, frontire townes, bands of foot, cornets of horse, and such like Commanders, known by the name of <HI>Haga's.</HI> Heere also, though hee seeme to step a little higher, may be seated the <HI>Cady,</HI> who is a Iudge or Magistrate ouer criminall causes, ouer whom there is one principall called <HI>Cadeleskier,</HI> as our Lord cheefe Iu∣stice, in some places they haue also <HI>Sub-Bashawes</HI> accor∣ding to his <HI>Sansacks, Trimatriots,</HI> or countrey diuisions, ei∣ther for maintaining his armies, or prouision ouer his ci∣ties. Then may you name with a little better reputation the Treasurer called <HI>Testerdy,</HI> ouerseer of customes, which is an office farmed by the <HI>Iewes,</HI> his <HI>Chancellor,</HI> Doctours of the Law, and such like.</P>
<P>On the sixt step ofhonour is the <HI>Bashaw</HI> lifted vp, who is a principall Viceroy, or at least hath beene, ouer King∣domes <NOTE PLACE="marg">6</NOTE> and Countries, such as <HI>Arabia, Aegypt, Tauris, Tunis,</HI> and diuers others, both in <HI>Asia, Affricke,</HI> and <HI>Europe,</HI> and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Beg, in Tur∣kish is great or honoura∣ble.</NOTE> according to the dignity and maiesty of the place called <HI>Beglerbeg:</HI> these are euery three yeeres <HI>mansuold,</HI> that is to say, remooued. For as they be subiect to strange ouerseers, so they are not permitted to grow rich, and indeed seeme iealous of their liues and estates, if any extraordinary for∣tune or greatnesse be imposed vpon them, except the <HI>Ba∣shaw</HI> of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> who either is so permitted to haue, or ma∣keth his place hereditary, daring sometimes to doe actions befitting an absolute Prince.</P>
<P>The last and greatest place of account is a <HI>Viceer,</HI> who commonly exceede not fiue in number, besides the <HI>Gene∣rall</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">7</NOTE> of the army, who is principall, these bee they that go∣uerne

the Empire, and to whose trust all matters depen∣ding in controuersie are committed. But you must consi∣der, that times haue altred their first strictnesse, when in the inchoation of goodnesse they resolued on a perseue∣rance &amp; stedfastnesse. For amongst the best of them, abuse hath bespotted that faire promising countenance, and o∣uer-vailed that beauty, which shewed true Iustice, puni∣shed extortion, and made adultery one of their haynousest offences, with fowle deformity, and new fashions of im∣piety. And thus much for their persons. Now to their customes, and generall conditions.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turkes,</HI> by the law of their <HI>Alcaron,</HI> should drinke nothing but water, or water mixed with honey, which they <NOTE PLACE="marg">The man∣ners of Turks, and their go∣uernment.</NOTE> call <HI>sherbert:</HI> yet the better sort haue certaine <HI>Iuliups,</HI> which be syrups of roses, violets, and such like, of which a spoon∣full or two will season a pinte of water, and is not onely pleasant in taste, but powerfull enough in operation: they shaue all their head, sauing one tuft on the crowne, super∣stitiously imagining to bee pull'd vp to heauen thereby: they maintaine their beards with great formality and cost, and haue them in such reputation, that they sweare by them: they sildome doe any thing in vaine, or speake an idle world, but in a substantiall grauity passe the time, euen at their pleasure and sports: they sit crosse-legg'd, and so commonly eat on the ground, or higher bench: they hate prophanation, and will not suffer <HI>Christ</HI> to be ill spoken of. Their religion generally carries a reuerent shew, but no substantiall commendation, as allowing God Omnipo∣tent, a father, inuincible, and creator of the world, and <HI>Ie∣sus Christ</HI> as the Prophet of his time, as <HI>Moses</HI> had beene before, but haue opinion that <HI>Mahomet</HI> was sent to them, as the last <HI>Mediator,</HI> with promise ofreturne to consum∣mate
<PB N="204" REF="109"/>
their eternity after 1000 yeeres, which time is almost expired, whereupon hee enrolled a booke called his <HI>Alca∣ron,</HI> in which he bound together, both lawes touching re∣ligion, and precepts for ciuill administration, with prohi∣bition of disputing on their probability, and warrantize of the flourishingest Common-wealth vnder the sunne, vpon their obseruation; coniuring them to a strict obedience, if euer they hoped to thriue in glory and terrestriall maiesty, and attaine the blessednesse of an immortall Kingdome, and a trebled felicity in the world to come: wherein hee imitated <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> who compelled the <HI>Lacedemonians,</HI> and bound them by oath to the resolute keeping his instructi∣ons, vntill his returne, which they ratefied by a solemne vow, whereupon coniecturing the subsequent good, hee banished himselfe for euer; or, as some suppose, threw himselfe from a cliffe of <HI>Olympus.</HI> The like wee reade of <HI>Empedocles,</HI> but with greater suspition of ambition, as in∣deede affecting a god-head, who cast himselfe into the <HI>Cra∣teres</HI> of <HI>Aetna,</HI> after hee had combined the <HI>Sicilians</HI> to the iudicious allowance of his decrees.</P>
<P>They loue their Churches, reuerence the Priests, make account of Naturals, dumb men, and Lunaticks, and must <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their reli∣gion.</NOTE> not enter into their <HI>Mosques,</HI> either with their shooes on, or fowle hands, or any vnreuerent gesture. Amongst these the order of <HI>Deruices</HI> or Turners are of greatest ac∣count, as men liuing a contemplatiue life, and no way tran∣sported with mundane affaires. They celebrate diuers re∣ligious dayes, especially Friday, and haue many ceremo∣nies of preaching, musike &amp; solemne silence: concluding their seruice with a strange turning about, encreased by de∣grees from a slow stillnes to a violent circular whirling, pa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ible of foure seuerall diuisions, lasting in all an houre, ac∣cording
<PB N="205" REF="109"/>
to the modulent sound of certaine instruments, which haue a primordiall solemnity, and so by little and little encrease to a swiftnesse, in which time they with strange gestures looke vp to heauen, and when they haue done thus a quarter of an houre, all in a sweat they fall groueling to the ground, and haue certaine garments cast ouer them, to preuent taking of colde; then after a while they beginne againe, and so foure times together: the loo∣king vp hath relation to extraordinary visions, and that they are rauished with high inspiration, forgetting the world, and all affaires in the same: the prostitution on the ground would acknowledge the vilenesse of mans creati∣on, and their humility to consider of the same: they ob∣serue the ceremonie of praying for the dead, bewailing their losse, and bemoaning ouer the graues; they repaire to their Mosques or Temples foure times a day, and on Friday fiue: and they haue a solemne fast and a solemne feast, called <HI>Ramdam</HI> and <HI>Byrame,</HI> much about our Alhal∣low-tide, at which time their Mosques, and the turrets, are solemnely furnished with burning lamps night and day, fiue weekes together: with diuers other particulars, much like the absurd ceremonies, both of Greeke and Romish Churches, consisting all in forme and outward adoration, as you shall heare anone.</P>
<P>They circumcise the men, &amp; in <HI>Arabia</HI> cut their women, they sell all things by weight, write Bias, like the ancient <HI>Arabians</HI> and <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> read backward as the <HI>Iewes,</HI> and obserue many other customes of <HI>Moses</HI> Law. For their women are sildome or neuer seene abroad, except the meaner sort, who yet couer head and face (sauing their ve∣ry eyes: what rich apparrell soeuer shee weares, the out∣ward garment is a long cloth gowne with wide sleeues,
<PB N="206" REF="110"/>
breeches, boots, or rather buskins, and an ill-fashioned tire on their heads: their hands are without gloues, their nailes and eye-browes painted, which they learnt of the <HI>Greekes,</HI> and all outward appearance most vncomely; but within doores they are more stately, and with a comely presence entertaine those which are to be admitted. Their marria∣ges are somewhat strange; for they neuer see their wiues, vntill they lie with them, vnlesse it bee such as are able to buy slaues, and keepe many concubines; and then expect no dowry, either of land or money, but <HI>vtensells</HI> and pre∣sents of apparrell, which are carried in delicate baskets on boyes heads, singing of songs in the street before the Bride, vntill shee come to her place of aboad. In which negotiation are elder women employed, and dare not but tell the truth, vntill the matter be fully determined. Thus are also their incontinences satisfied by entercourses of Pandars, yet for aduantage they haue brothels and stewes; yea, the very <HI>Balnea's</HI> serue for meeting places.</P>
<P>Thus could I runne ouer a large field of discourses: but my purpose is onely by demonstration to bring the defects <NOTE PLACE="marg">The compa∣rison layd together.</NOTE> of this Empire in question, for all their ostentation of glo∣ry, and proud boasting of magnificent gouernment, yet so farre short of our example and comparison, as they are from iudgement and loue of religion, who extoll it for the greatest, best, and richest Kingdome of the world. <HI>Salomon</HI> led the Vantguard of royalty, and like a noble minded Land-Lord, let happinesse to farme amongst all his Ten∣nants rent free. The <HI>Turke</HI> is so farre from augmenting the peace and plenty of his subiects, that as soone as any of them is but entring into the field of thriuing and con∣tentment, he puls them backe, and thrusts them doggedly into the dungeon of penury and wants. <HI>Salomon</HI> was an
<PB N="207" REF="110"/>
honourable King, and sat on a throne to decide the con∣trouersies of his people. The <HI>Turke</HI> is an absolute Tyrant, and neither commeth amongst them, but for glorious magnificence, nor admitteth any to approach neere him, but for pleasure and wantonnesse. <HI>Salomon</HI> had Princes ouer the Tribes, and the sonnes of Lords enioyed their fathers immunities. The <HI>Turke</HI> hath none of eminence, but himselfe, and the name of slaue obscureth all light of posterity. <HI>Salomon</HI> kept an order in his cities and townes, whether they were places of harbour, traffique, and forti∣fication; or for concourse, sacrifice, and reposednesse. The <HI>Turke</HI> alloweth none, or very few, with <HI>Decorum</HI> and glory of Citizens. In the dayes of <HI>Salomon,</HI> the Country-man liued at peace vnder his vine, and the <HI>Israelites</HI> with∣out number eat, dranke, and made merry. Amongst the <HI>Turkes</HI> nothing but feare and terrour is threatned, like a tempestuous storme hanging ouer the heads of the Inhabi∣tants. For the cities lie deuasted, the townes depopulated, and confusion is powred out in full measure amongst them; yea, spred like a menstruous cloth, to make mode∣sty and true gouernment ashamed, so that if you returne to the ouerlooking the gallant fields of <HI>Greece,</HI> which in times past was a subiect for Philosophers and Poets to write vpon, except some few, namely <HI>Constantinople, Gratianopolis, Andrinople, Philipopolis, Gallipolis, Salenica,</HI> and such like, and heere and there a pretty towne in an Iland, the rest are vnwalled, the people vnarmed, their goods taken by force, their daughters reserued for incon∣tinency, and the whole Countrey a true patterne of mise∣ry, insomuch that the Inhabitants being Christians, in a manner creepe into their houses at a little doore through a wall, otherwise shall a <HI>Turke</HI> come and make a stable of
<PB N="208" REF="111"/>
his hall, rauish his daughter, abuse his wife, and consume him like a lingring disease, which washeth away the flesh, and leaueth nothing but skinne and bone: besides, he dare not manure the ground to grow rich, lest an intruder reap his haruest, and make his endeauours fruitlesse: so that though this great Emperour be so mighty in people, spa∣cious in territories, opulent in wealth, and glorious in im∣periousnesse: yet receiueth hee not the fift commodity of his countries, by reason the fields are vnplowed, the vine∣yards vndressed, the medowes vnstored with cattle, and the very trees vnpruned, all which were plentifully suppli∣ed and compassed about with the embracings of husban∣dry in the time of <HI>Salomons</HI> peace. Nay, such is the misery of corrupted times, that whereas the <HI>Turkes</HI> haue been euer a true and religious people toward their Prophet, obser∣uing the lawes of his <HI>Alcaron</HI> very strictly: in these dayes they are all transported with prosperity, and seduced with filthy and abhominable wickednesse. For they endure both sloth and idlenesse, augment their desires of inconti∣nency, maintaine the extremities of gluttony, and will bee drunke, against their owne prohibitions and naturall en∣clination.</P>
<P>I haue insisted the longer on these Turkish particulars, because of all the Empires of <HI>Asia,</HI> and Kingdomes of <HI>Affrick,</HI> it affoordeth matter of discourse, and mine owne commorance amongst them warrants the truth of what is published, whereby you may thus conclude, after a sum∣mary collection, that their Common-wealth may rather bee termed a coniuration of tyrannies, then method or forme of good gouernment: their Emperours masters of a slaughter-house, then fathers of the countrey: and their Gouernours such as the Iudges of <HI>Israel,</HI> when euery man
<PB N="209" REF="111"/>
did what was best in their owne eies, then <HI>Iosua</HI> or <HI>Samuel,</HI> who washed their hands in innocency, either from doing wrong themselues, or winking at others vnder them, wit∣nesse the stories you haue heard, and thousands other vn∣repeated. But if this will not yet exclude them out of our palace of happinesse, nor diuert their conceits, which are onely carried away with nouelties, why then let vs extract these fearefull particulars amongst them. First, that fun∣damentall <NOTE PLACE="marg">1</NOTE> poynt of establishment, by murthering all their brethren. Next their ambitious supplanting their fathers <NOTE PLACE="marg">2</NOTE> and elder brothers, and rather then they would bee disap∣poynted in their proiected drifts, thrusting them into a slaughter-house. Thirdly, the policy and cunning of their Concubines, who haue destroyed very worthy Princes for <NOTE PLACE="marg">3</NOTE> degenerating persons. Fourthly, the raging cruelty and iealousie against <HI>Bashawes,</HI> neither permitting the lawfull <NOTE PLACE="marg">4</NOTE> discent of the sonne, nor continuing long a constant opi∣nion toward the well-deseruing father (for euen the wor∣thy <HI>Cigala's</HI> themselues, had much a doe to keepe their cre∣dit without murmuring, and repining of others. Fiftly, a∣gainst the maine position of preseruing Iustice, their cor∣rupting <NOTE PLACE="marg">5</NOTE> by bribes and presents, euen to the peruerting of manifest causes, especially against <HI>Christians.</HI> Sixtly, the miserable estate of the country-man, and poore commu∣nalty, <NOTE PLACE="marg">6</NOTE> who are in as ill condition as their asses, fit for no∣thing but to haue heauy burthens layd vpon them. And last of all, their confusion of diet, both for the time and <NOTE PLACE="marg">7</NOTE> plenty, wherein nothing is gracious or acceptable, nor any thing worthy the name of a happy countrey, or weal∣thy people.

and wretchednesse. First concerning religion, the maine point and foundation of all goodnesse, in the daies of <HI>Salomon</HI> they knew not what a groue meant; a strange altar was odious vnto them, and vntill his later falling a∣way from God, which was reuenged with the falling away of 10. Tribes from his sonne, there was no mention made of idolatry, and the very sound was a harsh kinde of discord. In <HI>Muscouia</HI> they are both ignorantly superstiti∣ous, and ambitiously affected to superiority: for although in that poore knowledge they haue, they euer depended vpon the authority of the Greeke Church, as by their Saints may appeare, which be Saint <HI>George, Demetrius,</HI> and <HI>Nicholay,</HI> to whom is consecrated one of the richest Abbies of the world: yet haue they presumed in the as∣sumpting the same to themselues, boasting of a bargaine by commutation, wherein the Patriarch of <HI>Constantinople</HI> was contented to resigne to the Metropolitane of <HI>Mosco</HI> all his authority, and supremacy for a great summe of <NOTE PLACE="marg">1588.</NOTE> gold. But see the iust iudgement of God, as he returned into Greece, he was robbed of the same, and most treache∣rously murthered. Thus yet doe they presume of the glory of the Church amongst them, and in <HI>Russia</HI> thinke it sufficient to cry out IESV thou sonne of God: as for the Scriptures, in some places they haue the Greeke Testa∣ment onely, and heare of the Bible a farre off. For preach∣ing or interpreting, they know not what it meanes; and the common people beleeue any thing their Priests tell them, allowing of nothing but some ridiculous ceremo∣nies, strange fasts, and idle feasts. Concerning their Princes, oh how farre are they from the reciprocall duties between themselues and subiects, and those excellent prescriptions which <HI>Samuel</HI> prescribed to <HI>Saul,</HI> and <HI>Salomon</HI> practised to
<PB N="212" REF="113"/>
his eternall honour. For such hath beene the confused and disordred intrusion of these Emperours, that they haue without care of posterity, conscience, or the Com∣mon-wealth shouldred one another from their thrones by treasons, murthers, deuises, and publique hostility. For euer since that old <HI>Iuan Vasellowich</HI> grew odious to his subiects, horrible stratagemmes haue succeeded, and euen <HI>Poland</HI> like a neighbour hath feared the burning of his owne house, when the next hath beene on a blaze; especially in the vsurpation of <HI>Borris Pheordiwich,</HI> who to aspire to the dignity made away <HI>Demetrius</HI> the second sonne to <HI>Vasellowich,</HI> and so from other monstrous effects of policy obtained the Diadem, wherein at the first by his bounty and worthy promising demeanor, he in a man∣ner blotted out the print of his former vniust proceedings, and taught them as it were away to forget the wrongs done to their lawfull Princes, till at last growing odious to the subiect, a new search was made, and a further hurli∣burly about another Emperor confounded all estates, and for many yeeres hath turmoiled the Countrey round a∣bout. Concerning the gouernment, there is onely some forme of iustice, &amp; punishing of adultery; but so far from <HI>Salomons</HI> magnificense, <HI>Salomons</HI> pallace, <HI>Salomons</HI> proui∣sion, <HI>Salomons</HI> nauy, <HI>Salomons</HI> Nobles, <HI>Salomons</HI> tranquil∣lity and peace, and <HI>Salomons</HI> worthines in euery thing, that I am ashamed to name them for Christians. For the com∣mon people, though they lie not with other mens wiues, yet they change their owne as often as they list, and how∣euer the better sorte mainetaine many wiues, yet doe they practise nothing more then gurmondize and incon∣tinency, with Strumpets and Concubines, whom they re∣sorte vnto in certaine stoues or hot houses, as the hotter

Concerning their Citties? in a word both their Citties and townes are subiect to such bestialitie and confusion, that they seeme rather so many smoakie cotages, and Irish cabbines, then hansome dwellings, or conuenient places of aboad; and in <HI>Mosco</HI> it selfe for all her populousnesse, and large exten∣sion of ground, there is not any thing worthy the admira∣tion or imitation, more then the markets of furres, and some rich ornaments of the skinnes of beasts; as for the Citizens, or Countreymen, I rather resemble them to some scattered troupes of a discomfited army, then men orderly disposed to the managing affaires either for mutu∣all commerce, or noble trade of Merchants. And thus could I runne ouer all other particulars, but that I shall ouer-runne my owne discourse, considering there is no∣thing but a meere disparity betweene them and our ex∣ample.</P>

For although <HI>Aegipt</HI> hath bin counted the garner of corne, and that the watrey <HI>Ni∣lus</HI> hath dispersed her rivulets ouer many Countries, yea comming out of <HI>Aethiopia</HI> hath taken along sundry swel∣ling fountaines to accompany her into the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> sea; so that diuers Historiographers haue numbred 6000. Citties on the bankes of the same, and boasted of the glo∣ry of their Emperors, and mightinesse of their armies: yet (not once speaking of the barrennesse of the rest) could any of these places take vpon them any glorious exaltati∣on of a well compacted Common-wealth, or terrestriall happinesse of a Nation. For you may read, that when it flourished in the height of prosperity (as when there was a generall famine in many Countries) there was corne in <HI>Aegipt, Saba</HI> the Queene of <HI>Aethiopia</HI> came to visit <HI>Salo∣mon</HI> in his roialty, and went away with admiration, when she saw the difference betweene her owne Countrey, and the blessednesse of <HI>Iudea,</HI> so that the particular relation of the Court, and gouernment, was occasioned from this Empresses willingnes to be instructed, and desire to grati∣fie the King for his extraordinary magnificense, and ad∣ministration of the Common-wealth: whereby I am not incredulous of their information, that report, how that many times the Parents sell their children to Merchants for corne, and at all times send the people to the market for slaues, which are bought vp at easie rates, and disper∣sed ouer the world: nor will I much contradict their opi∣nion, that haue fashioned their Common-wealth out of an vnfashionable gouernment without law, terrour of dis∣obedience, ciuill institution, orderly precepts, and soci∣able

louing of one another. For since they marched vn∣der the colours of Christianity, it hath not beene much better, and except it be such as are borne vnder the same Climate, no man of a temperate Countrey can liue a∣mongst them. Their manners and customes I haue partly described, and could here adde, that howeuer they boast of their antiquity, as being the first Countrey inha∣bited by <HI>Chus</HI> the sonne of <HI>Cham,</HI> which in the Hebrew tongue signifieth blacke, and that afterward they changed their name from the sonne of <HI>Vulcane:</HI> I cannot finde ei∣ther any setled gouernment, or state worthy the imitati∣on; or noble enterprises befitting a story, or slender praise. Howeuer they are commended for the first acknow∣ledging a diuine power, and entertaining a religious Priest∣hood, and manner of celebration of sacrifices; I cannot see, that there now remaines any thing amongst them, but idle customes, and corrupted abuses, beleeuing the incarnation of Christ onely, without a better progression to sanctifying graces; and neuer disputing further then a barren obseruation of ridiculous ceremonies. How∣euer they haue some scattered Cities, and nobilitie in esti∣mation, as the Captaines of their Souldiers, and Leaders of their armies, I cannot finde either orderly preseruation of families, or louing entertaining of one another, but rather thefts, rapines, murthers, and spoyling of them∣selues, and passengers. Howeuer their Countries are very spatious, and haue a great quantity of ground with variety of people; yet is the barrennesse, and vnfrequen∣ted Citties a barre to their estimation; and as we say a lit∣tle good is worth a great deale of badde; and one corner of <HI>Canaan</HI> equalled tenne times as much ground for pro∣uision, and plenty of riches. As for their tying their haire
<PB N="216" REF="115"/>
in knots, their odoures, perfumes, sweet wood, spices, El∣liphants teeth, almugge trees, and such like; alas, there is neither milke, nor honey, neither good prouision for backe or belly, neither comlinesse of rayments for ornament, or necessity,; neither order for glory, or good neighbour-hood; neither prouision for hansomnes, or magnificense. To conclude in a word, it wanteth many things, wherein barbarous Nations (after their account) come neerer prosperitie, and retaineth nothing, which either happy kingdomes stand in neede of, or desire by way of imita∣tion. As for such blessings, wherewith God hath stored their Countries, and they haue corrupted the Merchants of <HI>Europe;</HI> I answere in one word for all, both for <HI>China, India,</HI> and themselues, that they resemble poyson throwne into a wholesome potion, which of it selfe had beene a <NOTE PLACE="marg">The mer∣chandize from India and Aethi∣opia super∣fluous things and such as we neede not.</NOTE> preseruatiue, but now is a dangerous receipt, and not fit for euery one to drinke: or else they are like sluttish maskes, which couer more beautifull faces, and debarre one another from pleasing themselues with their owne natiue comelinesse. But say, that both iewels, pretious stones, perfumes, spices, mineralls, mettall, and other glo∣rious riches are befitting the Maiesty of Princes, the ho∣nor of pallaces, the ornaments of Kings, and the benefit of Countries; I hope wee haue them in more abundance then themselues, and like the Seruant that proued better workeman than his Master, make more commodious vse of them, then any Countrey in the world: so that our Merchant is a noble aduenturer, and our Cities rather store-houses of blessings, then shops of wares: and as for LONDON it selfe, I protest, I rather wonder at it for her excelling prerogatiues, then commend it for a thriuing Emporium.</P>

For heere the cheefest

townes liue in freedome, and the Burgers boast of their wealth and policy, in manumitting themselues, and (as it were) sealing the honour of cheefe commanding; yea, sometimes contesting with the Emperor himselfe on their owne gates. As for the countrey commodities and pro∣uision tending either to necessity or pleasure; alas, the commutation consisteth in enriching particular persons, and smally to the augmentation of the Emperours Maie∣sty, wherein all the tracts of auarice, corrupt mixtures, o∣uer-reaching one another, and putting off either refuse things, or paltry trifles, as the <HI>Italians</HI> call them <HI>Baggatini:</HI> are trod amongst them, and euen beaten smooth with con∣tinuall entercourse. So that their marts and faires are so many boothes of drunkards, and instead of ships at sea, fill the fields with waggons of such strange creatures, who make their bellies as great deuouring gulphs as the sea, so that their eating and carowsing is farre from the moderati∣on of mirth, which the <HI>Israelites</HI> accustomed, or the Per∣sian banquet, where none were compelled: but letting that passe, as an imperfection proprietory to the countrey and nation. I can traduce them further, for mangling the bles∣sings of God bestowed vpon them, by the cuttings and hackings of many grosse sinnes, as vsury, rebellion, con∣tumacy, prophanation, swearing, drunkennesse, murthers, and such like: but especially for vilipending the high com∣mission of the Almighty in two principall matters. The one, in murmuring and repining at strangers, not suffering any to haue any commorance, or dwelling amongst them. For how euer in some of the cheefest townes there is a glo∣rious shew and formall entertaining of Marchants and passengers, who come stored with crownes to powre them into the laps of Inn-keepers, and houses of wantonnesse:
<PB N="219" REF="116"/>
yet will they neither releeue the wants of indigent beg∣gers, nor permit Gentle-man or Artificer to dwell amongst them, or be entertained as a free Denizon, being a stran∣ger of another countrey, except in some sparing cases, and times of necessity, wherein a bribe or great Princes com∣mendatory letters preuaile, by way of entreaty and insinu∣ation. The second is, their grossenesse and simplicity in refusing the right of Kings, and succession of their Em∣perours, debarring so the best of gouernments, which is the Monarchy, from ruling ouer them, and whereas they may alledge, that the suffrages of men are vncorrupt, and a Prince so chosen shall be the worthier, in regard his ver∣tues must be eminent, whereas the father may leaue a son compounded of so many vices, which ouerruling his ver∣tues, shall make him odious: or otherwise he may prooue simple, tyrannous, dishonest, or irregular. First, it is meer∣ly erroneous, because we are not to contest with the dispo∣ser of Kingdomes about his <HI>Vice-Gerents,</HI> in regard, that sometimes as a fatherly correction hee permitteth a defe∣ctiue Prince, rather then folding vp a sorer mantle of ven∣geance, to spred it abroad to their more greeuous punish∣ment. Next they haue failed in this also amongst them∣selues: for many of their Emperours thus elected, haue prooued doltish, lasciuious, cowardly, and rather mang∣lers of the Empire, then prouident stewards to augment the wealth and reputation of the same: nay, the best of their <HI>Caesars</HI> haue beene affrighted at the fulmination of a tyrannous Pope, and seduced with the imposturing cun∣ning of deceiuing Priests, and a corrupted religion, nor could they goe with the wise King to view his nauies, visit his cities, fortifie the townes, erect store-houses, or come neere the six steps of golde on <HI>Salomons</HI> throne, which was

most apparant, euen the other day, in one of their glorious Princes, from whom the house of <HI>Austria</HI> hath taken such firme rooting, that it hopes to spred so largely, and so high, that no daring hand shall presume to lop a bough, or breake off a principall stem. I meane <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, who for all his seeming corroborated mightinesse, quickly lost the loue of the Princes, and for want of ceremonies main∣taining the glory of a King, was euen scorned of Pesants. The story is breefly thus. Vpon the report of the losse of his gallies at <HI>Argier,</HI> he had a purpose to re-enforce his na∣uy, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Empe∣ror Charles the fift, de∣spised for his meane habit.</NOTE> and as the Poet sayes, <HI>saepe premente Deo, fert Deus alter opem,</HI> to hope, that as one misfortune had ouerclow∣ded the faire shining sunne of his glory: another happy winde would ouer-blow the threatning storme, and make a serene element, which caused him to come into <HI>Italy,</HI> for his better and speedier passage, either at <HI>Ligorn</HI> or <HI>Genoa:</HI> but entring into <HI>Millane,</HI> a leane olde man in a blacke cape cloake, the people thronging to see a glorious Emperour, or at least some magnificent shew and pompous ceremo∣nie: they were so daunted to be thus frustrated, and in a manner scorned to bee so disesteemed, that they neither gaue him a <HI>Viue le Roy,</HI> nor scarse opened a window to looke toward him: nay more, when hee set forward for <HI>Spaine,</HI> indeede there scarse went a voluntary Gentle-man with him, and the very Waggoners put their thumbs be∣tweene their fingers, in contempt of his troopes, which is as disgracious a thing in <HI>Italy,</HI> both amongst themselues, and against strangers, as either the lie in <HI>France,</HI> or <HI>Beco</HI> to the Gentle-man of <HI>Venice,</HI> whereat hee tooke such a con∣ceit, that he neuer returned into <HI>Italy</HI> or <HI>Germany</HI> againe, howeuer some would impute it vnto his greefe, for not preuailing against the <HI>Mahumetans:</HI> or deuotion, as desi∣ring

I must not now dispute, what it was in the flourishing times of <HI>Augustus</HI> and other Emperors, sweet∣ning contentment with the delicates of riches and plea∣sure, till God sent strange and cruell Physicians to purge them for their surfetting in gormandize and wantonnesse, I meane the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandalls:</HI> nor will take vpon mee to presage what it might be, if some diuine power would ga∣ther her plights together, and make it one handsome and magnificent garment for a sole soueraigne: but shew her, as she is now loose, vnlaced, and hath her ornaments di∣lacerated, and euen rent from her sides and shoulders. A∣las, it is far worse with them, then it was with the <HI>Israelites</HI>
<PB N="222" REF="118"/>
in the time of the Iudges, when euery man did what hee listed, and hauing no King (as if they had beene embra∣cers of the <HI>Tanist</HI> law in <HI>Ireland)</HI> ranne like sheep without a shepheard, and through the presumption of their owne forces, wrested the enheritance from the true heires. But more properly I may resemble them to the <HI>Anarchies</HI> of <HI>Greece,</HI> who through emulation at one anothers greatnesse and credit in the world, kept true prosperity indeed from a noble race and happy thriuing amongst them. For as in ciuill warres, while diuers factions fight one by one, all are in the end subdued; whereas if they did vnite themselues with a stubborne holding together, they might peraduen∣ture hazard and propulse the greatest strength, and raised forces against them. So in the plenties of peace and flouri∣shes of happinesse, the best portion diuided into many parts will quickly bee spent, and a flowing riuer hath not that brauery, when it is cut out into small brookes, as in his owne streame running in a deep and fashionable chan∣nell. Againe, as in noble families, when the mannour houses, capitall messuages, and populous Lordships de∣scend to one immediate heire, the dignity &amp; honour of the same, is more and more vpheld, whereas if they were di∣uided amongst many sonnes, the glory would soone bee extinguished, and strength of the first firmnesse rebated. So fareth it with <HI>Italy,</HI> the very blessings affoorded by na∣ture are disioynted, and the diuiding it into Principates, hath also deuided her fortunes, and former credit of raui∣shing beauty. For in one corner rules the <HI>Spanyard,</HI> at ano∣ther end encrocheth the <HI>Sauoyan,</HI> on this side the <HI>Venetian</HI> keepeth all in awe, on that the <HI>Hetrurian</HI> Duke maintaineth a iurisdiction, heere the Church with the contraries of blessing and cursing locketh vp S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Peters</HI> Patrimony, as

the Pope himselfe in the castle of S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Angelo,</HI> there many petty Princes are iealous of forraine trecheries, and how∣euer they doe maligne the common enemy, yet can they not agree amongst themselues, but repine with an emu∣lous hate against one another.</P>
<P>But would I could vnite them together, and set vp the wals of <HI>Rome,</HI> placing her seuen hils in such an order, that the city might boast of twenty mile compasse, and the go∣uernment lift vp a head, as in <HI>Daniels</HI> visions. Or that I might in a yeere of <HI>Iubile</HI> settle you vnder the wings of the Angell on the top of the palace, and shew you the Consi∣story of Cardinals, the triumphs of a Popes inauguration, his stately carrying on mens shoulders, his triple crowne, and such like ostentous and pompous ceremonies with all the glorious celebrations of the other Princes, either at their owne elections, or entertainment of forraine Ambassa∣dours, yet would all this come farre short of our example. For the very prouision of <HI>Salomons</HI> palace would exhaust the countrey, consume the commodities, and like a barren ground drinking vp the raine, deuoure the plenty of the land, and pull in peeces their best compacted husbandry, of which wee haue had many instances in former times, when <HI>Italy</HI> suffered diuers famines and want of corne: so that if <HI>Aegypt</HI> had not beene a store-house and garner of graine to let in a supplyment, as it were an vnlookt for way, the people had perished for lacke of food, and the countrey beene wasted for want of husband-men and til∣lage. Againe, say they could drinke in vessels of golde (wherein yet I finde them very sparing) and that they de∣termined to expose the glory of some ambitious triumph. Wherewith should their cups ouerflow, considering their wines are not only small, but in such a penury and scarcity,
<PB N="224" REF="119"/>
that if the women and children were not not prohibited, or at least from the customes of modesty did not limit themselues, a stranger should either drinke water or no∣thing, and had not wherewithall to satisfie their thirst. As for the <HI>Villano,</HI> he is glad of any water, and quencheth his heat from the muddy channells, which fall from the mountaines of snow, and are cleansed with much adoe by the swift courses of <HI>Eridanus,</HI> which sendeth her streames into the Adriatick sea, and makes a confederacy with other riuers for the same purpose, though the places require stranger titles. Many other defects haue, and must bespot this countries face, and debarre it from boasting of that happinesse, I would propose vnto you. For though the Inne-keepers daughter goe in a sattin gowne, and that the brauery of their women is amplified from their attire, as if the burs had golden kernels, and euery corner were full of silke-wormes; yet doe they neither eat good meat, feed cleanely, nor meet together with friendly neighbor-hood, or inuitation. As for ciuill gouernment and administration of Iustice, euery Prouince hath a seuerall method, and the pride of one anothers liberty and power to defend a delin∣quent flying to them for succour, raiseth a presumption of strange committing offences, and perpetrating horrible thefts, rapes and murthers: so that whether they by <HI>bandi∣ted,</HI> or no; when reuenge or wicked instigation hath set any man on worke, the <HI>Neapolitan</HI> flies vnto <HI>Rome,</HI> the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> to <HI>Florence,</HI> the <HI>Florentine</HI> to <HI>Venice,</HI> the <HI>Venetian</HI> to <HI>Mantua,</HI> and so in all the rest. And for the more peaceable Inhabitants, they sildome reioyce vnder a vnity, and very sparingly admit of any customes, tending to the smooth∣nesse of loue and true contentment: so that in a manner all the defects, which deforme the naturall beauty of King∣domes,
<PB N="225" REF="119"/>
may be heere lookt vpon with pitifull eyes, and much lamented with passionate heart greefe. As for those ostentous heapes of stone, which transport the slight cre∣dulity of the ignorant, to beleeue that it surpasseth for ci∣ties, buildings, and outward magnificence, any countrey in <HI>Europe,</HI> when you come to examine particulars, you shall finde it onely, as we deceiue our children, in sugring ouer a little course bread, made in the forme of delicate manchet on the outside. For what saies <HI>Tacitus,</HI> cities are the men; gouernment, feeding; and obedience of people, subiect to formall orders and handsome ceremonies, and not houses or palaces made of lime and stone, vnfurnished of dwellers, voyd of hospitality, and iealous euen of one anothers best enclinations, when they are furnished at the best. So that besides all naturall imperfections: In <HI>Italy</HI> there is neither roome in the house for thy seruants, nor litter for the cammels, especially out of their frequented high road wayes, as <HI>Rebecca</HI> promised the steward of <HI>Abra∣hams</HI> family: neither can you fetch the well-fed veale from the droues to entertain the man of God with the Patriark, dresse fine venison with <HI>Esau</HI> for olde <HI>Isaak,</HI> nor kill the fat calfe with the good father, that welcomed home his peni∣tent sonne, which makes me remember a merry reason, by one of the same countrey, who being demanded why the muttons, calues, and other cattle, were so few, small, and leane; replyed very soberly, because the <HI>Italians</HI> deuoured the grasse in sallets, and robbed the pastures to deceiue the poore cattle: but in truth the sunne kisseth the ground with that feruency, and the fields are so matted with dry∣nesse, that for the most part the medowes are vnbefitting to satisfie much store of cattle, nor can feede oxen to any purpose. In another place, a Curtezan questioned with a∣bout

the conditions of men in her faculty, or if you will, concerning matters of incontinency, touching the <HI>Italian</HI> (for all the worlds opinion of his forwardnesse in that kinde) she answered with a tush, <HI>Il Italiano pisciar molto.</HI> Nor, if I would flatter them according to the ridiculous soothing of Princes: could I of late dayes exemplefie any of their glorious exployts abroad, or famous attempts at home, more then ruining one another, and making of forts and fortifications, which sometimes prooued like <HI>Perillus</HI> bull to the inuentor, many times emboldned disobedi∣ence to relie on a wrong security, and at all times raised vp greater distrust and fowle suspitions, euen in their best ci∣ties and gouernments, as you see, how <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Millane</HI> is curbed, &amp; the braue liberty of the Gentle-men, strangely fettered from the terror of Citadels, of which the <HI>Spanyard</HI> himselfe is yet transferred with an imaginary conceit, that souldiers may be corrupted, and no place is so impregna∣ble: but thendeauours and policy of men can subiect to the fortune of alteration.</P>

For all the Dukedome of <HI>Millane</HI> was incorporated into the house of <HI>Sforza</HI> a deuised name for his valour and mar∣tiall proceedings; with diuers others of this kinde: yet alas you see, what is now become of <HI>Naples,</HI> and the no∣ble man repines at his lost liberty, nor can he be satisfied, for all he may flutter in a golden cage, and ride through the streetes in a veluet Carosse; yet you see that <HI>Rome</HI> hath beene sacked, and almost trampled vnder feete euen of late daies, insomuch, that when the Duke of <HI>Burbon</HI> en∣tred for <HI>Charles</HI> the 5. no worthy <HI>Roman</HI> durst shew his head, and the other principates of <HI>Italy</HI> were afraid of pul∣ling downe such a house, whose dust must needes fall into their eyes, and smoakie rubbish stifle their breath; yet you see, how pittifully <HI>Ferrara</HI> and <HI>Vrbine</HI> haue lost their repu∣tation of courtshippe, and offred their coronets on the altar of a Clergie mans vsurpation: yet you see, how <HI>Flo∣rence</HI> liues now, and for all the stile of <HI>Magnus dux Her∣truriae,</HI> thinketh of nothing but amassing of treasure from mechanicke drudgery, and corrupted auarice: yet you see, that <HI>Rhodes</HI> is lost, and the miraculous Colossus beaten to pouder, that diuers discomfitures haue made <HI>Venice</HI>

sweate in the midst of her cold bathe the sea; that <HI>Cyprus</HI> was pul'd from her sides by violence, when but a little more strength and prouidence would haue kept it secure, and so warme, that no boisterous arme of <HI>Turkes</HI> should haue vncouered her to the catching of cold; that they haue beene since inforced to contriue a treatice of pacification with the <HI>Gran Signeur,</HI> and in truth beene subiect to many indignities, which a man would not imagine so rich and politicke a gouernment could endure: but alas the Duke is but an vnsignificant voice. For the sword is caried be∣fore the <HI>Gran Concilij,</HI> who take order, that he neither liue profusely in his expences, nor haue any daring confi∣dence to practise any thing preiudiciall to their gouern∣ment: yet you see, <HI>Mantua</HI> is now at quiet, and dare not entermeddle with any warlike troubles, or martiall af∣faires, except he haue the cunning to discouer the aduan∣tage of a preuailing party, and the fortune to ranke him∣selfe in the strongest squadrons: yet you see, how <HI>Millane</HI> mournes like a captiue, and for all her 300. Carosses, and 500. foot-cloths, dare not lift vp a countenance suta∣ble to their hearts, nor a hand to pull the ramparts of the Citadle to the ground, when their wishes would faine see all throwne into the sea. And so in diuers others of this kinde.</P>
<P>As for the generall reputation of <HI>Italy,</HI> which it hath gotten by Marchants, it is abused in the <HI>metonimia.</HI> For their silkes and veluets, their marchandize and wares, that all <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Turky</HI> welcome them into their harbours and ports, but with such errours, ouersights, and perad∣uenture difficulties, that they neither make vse of nauiga∣tion out of their middle sea and Arches: nor haue any good Saylours and Souldiers amongst them: nor will ad∣uenture

as worthy men indeede for their countries honor, nor can performe any voyage with true iudgement and expedition. For the least affrighting newes of a Pirat, shall detaine them three months in harbour, and an vnexpected storme driue them into euery Port and Iland. Thus haue I my selfe beene witnesse, that an <HI>English-man</HI> hath left two great <HI>Italian</HI> ships in the towne of <HI>Xant,</HI> for feare of <HI>Ward,</HI> supposed to houer about <HI>Sapientia</HI> an Iland adioyning, be∣ing bound for <HI>Scanderon,</HI> and sayled to <HI>Cyprus,</HI> vnladed, dispatched, and returned backe againe, ere they were on their iourney. Nay, thus haue I knowne them foureteene weekes betweene <HI>Constantinople</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> which an <HI>En∣glish-man</HI> with a prosperous wind hath dispatched in four∣teene dayes, although I imagine it 1700. English mile, and in lesse then six weekes almost with any winde. So that <HI>Venice</HI> it selfe boasting of the brauery of three hundred gallies, eight or ten galleasses, and thirty ships for mar∣chants, neither hath sufficient men to man twenty, nor can without time and great expences fill vp the roome of that inuentory without <HI>Greekes,</HI> who are their cheefest Saylors, and condemned slaues, whom they spare from a death at the gallowes, which must needs release them from world∣ly troubles, to a liuing misery in the gallies, wherein to breath in continuall horrour is worse then twenty deaths indeed. Thus could I tire you with distasting particulars against the reputation of <HI>Italy:</HI> but I meane not to ouer∣looke them with any maleuolent aspect, or disparage them, to bring my speeches within compasse of defamati∣on: but onely keep my example in practise, and conclude, that it wanteth many things (with <HI>Germany)</HI> to make it proportionable with <HI>Salomons</HI> greatnesse, and <HI>Canaans</HI> goodnesse.</P>

intrusion, or tyrannous desire of deuouring. Shall wee I say goe thither, and looke out a match for our example; me thinks I am answered of euery man that weares a light hat, great ruffe, and full paire of hose. If <HI>Spaine</HI> doe not e∣quall him, who can doe it? I am not yet prepared for such a satisfaction, but will presume to shut <HI>Spaine</HI> out of dores, from entring into the priuy chamber of one example, for all his <HI>India</HI> supply, the only tumor of his greatnes, which did not <HI>Apollo</HI> pardon the fault, would prooue but the wish of <HI>Midas,</HI> who with his golden fortunes wanted the vse of natures benefits, and could neither eat nor drinke without choaking. But to particulars.</P>
<P>If <HI>Spaine</HI> be the richest Kingdome of <HI>Europe,</HI> and that some of them boasted, when time was, in ouerlooking the beautifullest worke in the world, I meane the Chappel at <HI>Westminster,</HI> that their King was able to make such ano∣ther of siluer: where is <HI>Salomons</HI> golde amongst them, or <HI>Ierusalems</HI> plenty? when siluer had no better reputation then stones, and euery man in <HI>Iudea</HI> was rich indeed, with∣out abusing others, or others repining against them: where is their care to store the countrey, which questionlesse mo∣ney would doe, from other exuberant prouinces, though nature had denyed them orderly prouision? How came the <HI>Malec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>ntents</HI> in <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Brabant,</HI> to threaten the principall cities for want of their salary? who incited the Garisons of <HI>Antwerp, Gaunt,</HI> and euen <HI>Brussels</HI> it selfe, with diuers other townes, to mutinie? who distasted sundry times the whole armies vpon their marches and employ∣ments? who aduised the Treasurers to be so slacke in dis∣charging of <HI>Liberanca's</HI> and other souldierlike pensions? who doth euery yeere thrust the Garisons into penury and scarsity, insomuch that not onely in the Low-Countries,
<PB N="232" REF="123"/>
but euen in his gouernment of <HI>Millane, Naples,</HI> and <HI>Sicilia,</HI> the souldier wanteth, and many times is compelled to re∣mit one halfe, to purse vp the other: Is not all this ei∣ther for want of treasure (the opinion whereof hath made his pride swell vncontrollable) or orderly distribution? the spring from whence the fluent plenty of <HI>Salomon</HI> had encrease. Be not therefore affrighted at this monster opi∣nion, nor seduced with the vanity of report. For put the best Hispaniolized English man to the skirmish of vnder∣standing the truth, and the wealth of <HI>Spaine</HI> shall prooue but false fires, if you be so neere to discouer their disburse∣ments, and infinite occasions to dispend their treasure: but if you should aduenture to lay their peeces to the light with <HI>Salomons</HI> cloth, by way of comparison, good God, how course, how cockeld, how short, how shrinking, how faulty, and indeed ridiculous would all appeare? And thus much for their wealth. Now to the rest.</P>
<P>What hath <HI>Spaine</HI> worthy commendation, much lesse any prerogatiue of happinesse? why, <HI>Canaan</HI> flowed with milke and honey, yeelding such blessings of encrease, that the King not onely had his great store of prouision with∣out repining: but <HI>Israel,</HI> as the sand of the sea, eat, dranke, and made merry, and can this bee done in <HI>Spaine?</HI> The burnt hills and desart places will quickly answer the argu∣ment; the country-man hides his garlike and onions, as ashamed of his diet; the Citizen powders his fish, and buyes cheese of the Dutch-man; the Gentle-man is limi∣ted what he shall eat, and how much hee may carry home to his family; the Court hath much adoe to be supplyed, and many concussions are practized from the Kings pre∣rogatiue, to furnish the offices with reasonable allowance, and the whole Kingdome is sometimes affrayd to want

bread; whereupon certaine agents are employed, euen in remote countries, to bring in both corne and victuall, tempting both them and our selues with golde and ready payment of money: for which purpose onely is a <HI>prouiso</HI> in their acts of Parliament, concerning exportation of coyne, of which in truth though they haue great cause to boast, yet are they tied to so many inconueniencies for o∣ther wants, that in their best cities is neither good fare, nor good lodging, nor any thing worthy the name of a bles∣sing. As for their silly praising of sallets, fruits, and herbs: I remember S<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Roger Williams</HI> answer to an idle <HI>Spanyard,</HI> boasting of his countries citrons, orenges, oliues, and such like: I, but (sayd he) in <HI>England</HI> we haue dainty veale, and well fed capons to eat with this sawce, and many delicate dishes worthy the name of sustenance indeede. For God made the beasts of the earth to liue on the grasse and fruits of the same; but man to liue vpon them, and command all. So that <HI>Adams</HI> wisdome gaue them titles, and his su∣perioriry prescribed subiection: but how? for mans vse, mans delight, mans necessity, mans conuersation, mans triumph. Thus doth oyle make a cheerfull countenance, wine a gladsome heart, bread a strong body, and flesh a ful∣nesse of bloud: thus was <HI>Salomons</HI> palace and tables fur∣nished, and <HI>Dauid</HI> praised God for infinite blessings: thus were odours and incense prouided, and the loue of bre∣thren compared to the deaw and balsome of <HI>Hermon,</HI> or the costly oyntment on <HI>Arons</HI> vestures: thus in <HI>Peters</HI> vi∣sion he might kill and eat, and the Sauiour of the world li∣ued amongst Publicans, feasted at marriages, and allowed of honest conuersation: and thus had <HI>Canaan</HI> neighbourly meetings, banquets of triumphs, and times of publike and priuate celebrations. But in <HI>Spaine</HI> no such matter; they
<PB N="234" REF="124"/>
neither dare, nor can bid you welcome. For farre worse then in <HI>Italy,</HI> idle iealousie, filthy malice, feare of expen∣ces, arrogant menaces, wicked suspition, and such like, will debarre you from the pleasure of inuitation, from the free∣dome of entercourses, and cannot sauour the noble liberty of mutuall amity. <HI>Canaan</HI> had the temple furnished as God commanded, the Priest obedient to the King, the Prophets in estimation, and the feasts of the Leuiticall Law orderly celebrated. <HI>Spaine</HI> is polluted with Paga∣nisme, and inuented that cruell office of Inquisition to pu∣nish the Moores, or such as adhered to their superstition, is ouerawed by the Cleargy, and is so terrified with the thundring voyce of excommunication, that he durst not but put his owne sonne to death, to please the Pope. <HI>Ca∣naan</HI> was a receptacle for strangers, loued princely solem∣nities, and could not endure neither begger, nor whore of their owne nation. <HI>Spaine</HI> hates all men, or at least vili∣pends them in respect of themselues, commits them to fire and sword, that exclaime against their stewes and pro∣phanation, and cannot order many solemne festiuals, ex∣cept at a Kings inauguration, a Princes marriage, or a Car∣dinals iollity: where yet an <HI>Italian</HI> inuention shall fill a ta∣ble with painted trenchers and dishes of <HI>China:</HI> but a hun∣gry belly may cry for meat, and not be satisfied.</P>
<P><HI>Canaan</HI> had cities of refuge, cities of store, cities of strength, cities for horses, and the Kings magnificence, to all which the high-waies were conuenient, and men passed to and fro without danger, or want. In <HI>Spaine</HI> you must haue a Guide, yea sometimes a guard, and are so farre from expecting reliefe after your daies endurance, that if you haue not a borracho before your saddle, and commo∣dious prouision on an Asse or Moile hired for the same

But <HI>Spaiue</HI> must mourne for strange disparity this way, and either la∣ment that the whore of <HI>Babylon</HI> hath poysoned her Coun∣tries with the dregges of abomination, or complaine, that the women are painted like the images of the groues, and sit in the high-way, as <HI>Thamar</HI> when shee went to deceiue <HI>Iuda.</HI> For if they be honest, they are for the most part vn∣pleasing, and swartisb: if Curtezans, dangerous and im∣pudent: so that for these and many other insufficiencies

For setting the wisedome of <HI>Salomon</HI> aside, whereof <HI>Fraunce</HI> could seldome make ostentation, the Queene of <HI>Saba</HI> commended the obedience of the Princes, the sitting of his seruants, the ordering of the palace, the furnishing of the tables, the prouision for the houshold, and the glo∣ry of his throne: not so much for outward maiesty of the structure, and princely magnificense in his attendants, as the aduised care ouer his subiects, and impartiall determi∣ning of controuersies.

<P>The Kingdome of IVDEA and gouernment of CA∣NAAN, as soone as euer obedience had set in a foote a∣mongst them, admired the wisedome of their women, as well as admitted the policy of the men; and in no sort debarred the daughters, neither from the princely throne, nor fathers inheritances, when the sonnes were extinct, and the line failed in the males, which all men know, whose consciences are opened with the key of vnderstan∣ding Gods truth. For the daughters of <HI>Zelophaad</HI> came before <HI>Iosua,</HI> and had their portion with the rest of the Tribes: But in <HI>Fraunce</HI> the Law salicke debarreth the wo∣man from her lawfull inheritance, out of a wilfull positi∣on, that the <HI>Flower-deluce</HI> may not go to the distaffe, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The law sa∣licke in <HI>France</HI> a∣gainst the law of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>od and nations.</NOTE> which I wonder at the rather, because we haue such forci∣ble instances both in Scripture, and many other worthy Nations to the contrary.

Whereby I cannot but wonder, that neither example, nor precept can preuaile with them, considering in all kingdomes, with all sexes, and at all times such inhi∣bitions to debarre the right of kingdomes from the true and indubitate successors did not passe without the scan∣dall of intrusion, tyrannie, and wrong.

from an inconuenience (as they suppose) they haue fal∣len into a mischiefe, and if I would vse it by way of per∣sonating, whereas in submitting to diuine appointment in such cases, they might please both God and man, in ouer-ruling the truth, they haue made their preposterous dealing ridiculous to all the world. For howeuer they deny their owne naturall daughters this prerogatiue, by a contrary fashion they admit of stranger women to bee more imperious ouer them: as by the two late Queene mother Regents, and both <HI>Italians</HI> of the house of <HI>Me∣dices,</HI> is made apparant by lamentable experience: what the one contriued, and how like a firebrand she had like to haue set all <HI>Fraunce</HI> on a blase; the History is pregnant, and the Legend of the Cardinall of <HI>Loraine</HI> composed by that true hearted Frenchman <HI>Francis de Lisle</HI> a man of ho∣nour, is most apparant; &amp; how the other is suspected is now no newes: But to the rest.</P>
<P><HI>Salomon</HI> made diuers nauies, went in person to view his shippes, had great custome from his Merchants, loued and maintained good Marriners and pilots, contracted leagues with forraine Princes, making the confirmation of them honourable, and performed all good offices, that

tended to the expatiating his glory. <HI>France</HI> wanteth ship∣ping, is carelesse of nauigation, raiseth few Saylors, sel∣dome attempteth voiages, or discoueries, and hath many times incurred the imputation of perfidious breach of faith, vnder that diabolicall position, <HI>fides non est conser∣uanda cum Haereticis:</HI> as also that iesuiticall doctrine of e∣quiuocation: witnesse their horrible massacres, the impri∣soning the Princes of the bloud, their tragicall warre, the inhumane murther of the Admirall, the Guisian pride, and the terror <HI>Francis</HI> the third was put into, when he was put into the Lovure. <HI>Salomon</HI> had that good order and obedience in his townes and cities, that he knew his cities of store, his cities of traphique, his cities of fortification, his cities of refuge, and his cities of composition. But in <HI>France</HI> both cities and townes with their inhabitants, and Merchants are vnfashionable, sluttish, dangerous, rebel∣lious, and the people neither of wealth, nor eminence: In <HI>Paris</HI> they dare talke of a Kings wantonnesse, enter∣meddle with tractates of Parliament, and State, call any Prince <HI>Hugonet,</HI> that onely saies the <HI>Nostre Dame</HI> is but a darke melancholly Church, and iustifie very monstrous and abusiue actions: Besides, to tell of their inconstant and refractary dispositions, would be too tedious, and sooner discouer their loathsome treasons, then preuent the customary, and mischeeuous practises of the people.</P>

The wisdome of <HI>Salo∣mon</HI> setled his cities, that strangers were admitted at all times, except in frontire townes, which peraduenture were guarded in the night, according to martiall disci∣pline, prouided that the passages were easie and secure, ad∣mitted of all complainants, and leuiated their greeuances, aduanced himselfe on a golden throne to entertaine mat∣ters of Iustice, allowed of the Prophets, who yet out of zeale cryed out against the abuses of the Temple and Pa∣lace, and commanded the subiect, first to remember his duty to God; then his obedience to the Prince; and last of all, his loue to his neighbour: and this hee performed by admonitory preceps to enstruct the ignorant, and princely indignation to punish the obstinate. <HI>France</HI> re∣ferreth all to Parliaments and Presidents, excludeth the reformed Churches out of the walls of the cities, hath the name of Prophet in derision, suffered the <HI>Iesuites</HI> to mur∣ther two famous Princes, permitteth them still a Sanctua∣ry, and from worldly policy excludeth true religion out

To conclude, in <HI>France</HI> many particulars choak the breath of happinesse, from giuing life to a glorious Kingdome indeede, if the reciprocall duties betweene Prince and subiect were but easily extended: so that with these de∣fects I cannot chuse but exempt her from sitting on any hand of <HI>Salomons</HI> throne.

Iustices, and other inferiour officers: insomuch, that it hath layd an imposition on the endeauours of a prin∣cipall scholler, and hee (according to the secret of satisfa∣ction) hath most worthily vnclasped the records of anti∣quity, and with such sufficient ampliation, that our aduer∣saries haue beene silent in excepting against it. But to my first purpose: I say, that to match all the particulars, wher∣with I haue stored <HI>Salomons</HI> magnificence and the coun∣tries prosperity, there is not at this houre any Kingdome in the world, so ready, apt, or worthy to take him by the hand, to pace out the measures of true glory and happi∣nesse, as the Kingdome of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning our glory abroad, what worthy voyages haue we made? I hope no people or nation euer equalled vs, witnesse S<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Iohn Mandeuill</HI> into <HI>India</HI> by land; <HI>Stafford</HI> ouer <HI>Europe,</HI> much about the same time; <HI>Ienkinson, Wil∣loughby, Borogh,</HI> and many others into <HI>Russia</HI> and <HI>Muscouia; Forbisher</HI> and <HI>Hawkins</HI> to discouer the northerne passages: the <HI>Fenners, Ralph Lane, Iohn Clarke,</HI> and diuers into <HI>Ame∣rica;</HI> another voyage, where of S<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> was the proposer; our setling in <HI>Virginia;</HI> our traffique to the <HI>West Indies, Brasill, Peru, Caribana,</HI> and <HI>Guiana;</HI> Captaine <HI>Drake</HI> round about the world, twice or thrice; <HI>Thomas Candish</HI> the like, our trauels to the <HI>East Indies,</HI> or <HI>Philippines;</HI> the Earle of <HI>Cumberlands</HI> worthy voyages, &amp; amongst others, that to <HI>Santo Port-Ricco;</HI> the <HI>Portugall</HI> voyage; <HI>Cales</HI> voy∣age; the Iland voyage, and sundry others; as in Master <HI>Hackluits</HI> booke about this subiect only. Besides moderne trauellers, both of Noble-men &amp; Gentle-men, although euery man is not a free Denizon of prosperities Kingdom, nor can boast of natures bounty in the gifts of vnderstan∣ding, or fortunes liberality in disposing her treasures. If
<PB N="244" REF="129"/>
you would see how our marchants are bestowed, look into all the Ports of the world, you shall find them setled, &amp; our shipping in harbour? If you could view all the countries of the earth, where men dare or can come, we are nobly dispersed, &amp; I beleeue might be pull'd out of the center of the same, if such a passage did euer excite man to explore for secrets, marchandize, or wealth. If you were admitted into the remotest palaces of Emperours &amp; Kings; yea <HI>Tar∣tary</HI> it selfe, <HI>English-men</HI> would salute you, and speak your owne language: and if you haue a purpose to affright idle∣nesse with any enterprize in the world, especially to make them beleeue, that the hand of profit will fill their laps with plenty, <HI>English-men</HI> dare set endeauours on their best feet, and can tell how to tumble all blockes and hindran∣ces aside, which may either terrefie them from such enter∣prizes, or detaine them from the glory of the actions: only heere lies a secret of traducing them, that a supposition of the wants of others, or feare of cumbersomnesse, when they meet with an indigent countrey-man abroad, hath debarred free conuersation, and doth make the mutuall supplying the necessity of strangers, a harsh-kinde of wel∣come; yea, an absolute leauing them to misery, if they haue not bills of exchange or letters of credit, to ouer∣beare mischances.</P>
<P>But our glory abroad is truely expatiated, when you shall know how helpefull wee haue beene to other nati∣ons, both with purse and forces; yea, contrary to the opi∣nion of the world, concerning our penury, opened the en∣closures of riches, and hononrably supplyed the defects of other Kingdomes. Wee haue made peace betweene <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> and pacified those troubles long a∣goe. We haue releeued the Estates of <HI>Holland</HI> with men,
<PB N="245" REF="129"/>
money, and munition, vnderpropping them, as if a man should vndershore a ruinous wall, vntill the foundation were repaired. We haue assisted the Protestant Princes of of <HI>France</HI> in their first ciuill warres, and beene auxiliary to many noble houses of <HI>Germany,</HI> we setled the last King in his greatnesse, and lifted him vp to that honour, that none of his Predecessours had their crownes shining with such a lustre. We playd the Physician with <HI>Geneua,</HI> and admi∣nistred her such an antidote, that no aconite of Pope or <HI>Sauoy</HI> could envenom her to death, or contriue her destru∣ction. We brought the distressed Prince <HI>Antonio</HI> to knock at the gates of <HI>Lisbone,</HI> and had he not found a fatall vicissi∣tude of times and occasions; yea, the minds of inconstant men corrupted with by-respects, and priuate following the stronger side, we might questionlesse haue preuailed in the proiect, and vpon the least filling the sailes of our ex∣pectation with the winde of home assistance, brought re∣couery to receiue the fulnesse of life. Wee haue made <HI>Spaine</HI> weary of the warres, and at last desire a peace, which I would be loth to resemble to still waters, wherein are the deepest gulphs and most dangerous places to ad∣uenture. We returned the <HI>Polish</HI> Ambassadour, with ad∣miration at our Princes greatnesse and magnanimity. We haue setled the good opinion of the <HI>Muscouite.</HI> Wee haue emboldned the <HI>Venetians</HI> in their last dissentions against the Pope. Wee haue accorded the Arch-Duke, who not onely admitteth vs into entertainment, but giueth way vnto such, as yet maintaine the cause of the contrary. We haue welcomed the Prince of <HI>Moldauia,</HI> and as farre as po∣licy or charity could goe, brought him along into the faire fields of expectation to regaine his enheritance. We haue lately ouerlooked the fields of <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Russia;</HI> yea,
<PB N="246" REF="130"/>
thought it befitting to send a martiall supply into <HI>Den∣marck,</HI> and howeuer the <HI>Polander</HI> repine, must in the end (I beleeue) determine those controuersies. To conclude, (though it shall be no cause of ostentation) wee haue pro∣spered in so many glorious thriuings, that the <HI>Spanyard</HI> in his prophanation hath sworne IESVS CHRIST to become a <HI>Lutheran,</HI> and railed on report, for filling the world with the sound of so many memorable actions.</P>
<P>Concerning our glory at home, lay abroad our exam∣ple <NOTE PLACE="marg">The glory of England at home.</NOTE> and spare not, and marke the emptiest place, which we will not fill vp with comparison. First, the best manner of gouernment from Gods own mouth, which is monarchal; and philosophicall principles, which is a King; and morall enstructions, which is a distributer of Iustice; and peoples desires, which is an honourable preseruer of Common-wealths: all vnited in one person, from a continuall de∣scent of princely ancestours, gaining the loue and obedi∣ence of many nations, by excelling induments of nature, as wisdom, learning, iudgment, peaceable desires, honora∣ble liberality, magnanimity, &amp; such like. And did it please him to add some glorious repairing, or rather magnificent quadrant, to his palace at White-hall, being the principall place of entertainement, and the eye to ouerlooke such a city, as is not in the world, it would come neere our ex∣ample indeede. For the Kings house in <HI>Ierusalem</HI> was thir∣teene yeere a building, and no one thing addes more ho∣nour to a nation, then regardable edifices, and eminent workes of Maiesty, being the very fruit of peace, and (as it were) the birth-right of prosperity, whether it bring forth sumptuous structures or adorning monuments. And (if it were not a pride &amp; elation of hart to number the people, looke how many nations and languages are vnder subie∣ction:
<PB N="247" REF="130"/>
namely <HI>English, Scottish, Irish, Welch, Cornish, Ments, Ilanders</HI> both <HI>Hebrides</HI> and <HI>Orchades,</HI> &amp; the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Gersy</HI> and <HI>Iersy:</HI> so that if the honour of a King consisteth in the multitude of his subiects, what Prince hath more, and such variety? If you looke on his palaces, where are so ma∣ny, and so good, belonging to any Kingdome in the world? If you will behold his court; I hope for state, good order, expences, entertainment, and continuall attendan∣cy, other places come farre short? If you will view his shipping and nauies, I am sure you passe away with asto∣nishment, when you are enstructed in the secrets of their seruice and strength? If you will behold his armours and munition, they exceede report, and the Arsenalls of other countries haue neither such equipage nor sufficiency; but when you shall finde euery Noble-man and Gentle-mans house so well furnished, euery Hall and Company so well prouided, euery Shire so willing to continue their prepa∣ration, euery Master so cheerefull in storing himselfe, and euery man so ready to giue eare to any martiall summons, and prepare with ioy to attend the seruice; you must needs returne, not louing vs with feare and trembling, but affe∣cting vs with triumph and well wishes, for our preuailing against the proudest aduersary? If you will number vs at sea, I know there is not so many good Mariners and Say∣lours in <HI>Europe,</HI> excepting the Low Countries. If you will muster vs at land, who can shew such companies of foot? such troopes of horse? so many worthy seruitours? and so well appoynted? Insomuch that I know diuers Gentle-men of <HI>England,</HI> who can conduct 3000. men into the field (in their King and Countries name) of their owne tenants, seruants, and friends. If you will examine our Nobility, I confesse they doe not boast of factious greatnesse, as in
<PB N="248" REF="131"/>
<HI>France,</HI> &amp; the Princes of <HI>Germany:</HI> but their number, noble disposition, &amp; willingnes to be obedient, may passe in the best items of Fames account. If you would see our Coun∣cellors, prepare a reuerence, and settle your estimation to∣ward them for their orderly life, probity of manners, inte∣grity in deciding controuersies, &amp; affability in admitting suters: &amp; though you come from the <HI>Grandes</HI> of <HI>Spaine,</HI> the Principalities of <HI>Italy,</HI> the <HI>Electors</HI> of <HI>Germany,</HI> the Dukes of <HI>France,</HI> &amp; the States of other Countries, yea, the osten∣tous pomp of <HI>Cardinals:</HI> yet bee not too preiudicate, nor transported with selfe-conceited wilfulnes; for you shall see as great brauery, retinue, &amp; obseruation amongst vs, as any subiects in the world dare challenge or put in practise, for outward glorious ostentation: nay more, the order of our <HI>Garter,</HI> and the ceremonies of enstalling, are continued with that triumph and maiesty, that no one celebration of petty Princes dare lift vp a countenance of such iollity &amp; regardable honor. And if you will behold the other Cour∣tiers, they are generally so many, so handsome, so seruicea∣ble, &amp; of their own retinues so well prouided, that I protest they so farre exceede other places, both for gracefull shewes and sufficient estates, that I wonder, how such a corner of the world should haue such a generall conflu∣ence of all happinesse and courtship, as if a raised winde should beat the swelling sea of prosperity to one shore.</P>
<P>But if you will be rauished indeede, or transported with the loue of the world, come and behold the beauty of our Ladies, and the disposing them at a night of solemnity, to which if you adde the generall contentment, which our English women affoord generally, without sophisticate and adulterate additions, either to comelinesse or fauour, there is no man can hold his peace, but proclaime our pre∣eminence.
<PB N="249" REF="131"/>
Againe, if you would see <HI>Iustice</HI> proud of her entertainment, and how shee presents both <HI>praemium</HI> and <HI>poena</HI> to the seuerall attendants on her throne of equity; looke into our <HI>Starre-chamber,</HI> and view the <HI>Sunne</HI> in most perspicuous splendour, without so much as the least clow∣dy respect of persons. If you will enter our Gentle-mens houses, I hope, there is no such cupbords of plate, beds of of veluet and embroidery, hangings of tapistry, variety of roomes, duty of seruants, order of house-keeping, store of pastime, and all that man can desire in any countrey in the world. If you will search our cities and townes, what they want in outward deceit of formality (and yet I cannot so extenuate our buildings) is supplyed in sweetnesse and de∣licacy, and within doore surpasseth the best of them for wealth and furniture. As for expences, I am sure some Citizens of <HI>London</HI> are at more annuall charge of diet, then the Dukes of <HI>Venice, Florence,</HI> or <HI>Genoa,</HI> for their own palaces. If you will examine our marchants, howeuer some great <HI>Foulker</HI> or agent for a whole Kingdome, in <HI>Genoa, Antwerp, Brussels,</HI> or other citties may surpasse vs for vsury, venting commodities, or supposition of wealth: yet I am sure, there died not two such in one yeere, out of one towne in the world, as <HI>Spencer</HI> and <HI>Sutton.</HI> As for the rest, they surpasse for curious fare, statelinesse, follow∣ing their pleasures, handsome education, comely enter∣tainment, and orderly contribution, Besides, they liue at home in ease, purchase land with security, bring vp their children in daintinesse, maintaine their families in obedi∣ence, and cannot be matched by any forraine opposition. Would you be acquainted with the Trades-man, Artezan, and others of mannuall occupation, looke how hee liues, looke how he fares, looke where he dwels, looke what he
<PB N="250" REF="132"/>
weares, looke whether he goes to buy his meat, to such markets and shambles, that the very sight astonisheth all strangers, and once made acquainted with their variety and goodnesse, they are amazed at our blessings, and won∣der, how so much prouision can bee orderly deuoured. Would you be refreshed with the pleasant countrey aire; our Yeoman and Husbandman liueth in such delight and sweetnesse of situation, that you may repine at his health and prosperity: but if you consider in what comelinesse and decency, in what peace &amp; tranquility, in what neatnes and hospitality, in what wealth and good condition; you will fall to praising of God, for imparting his blessings to our nation, and wishing the like to your owne deficient countrey in this kinde: For beleeue it (as you shall heare heereafter) whether he be Purchaser or Farmer, our ene∣mies haue repined at our prerogatiues in this kinde, and our friends embtaced our noble customes with desire of imitation. I could adde many things to the ampliation of our glory, as our hauens and harbours, especially in <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> our riuers, high wayes, secure trauelling, vniuersities, castles, bathes, mines, and honorable orders of watchings, trainings, and musters: but I referre them to their due pla∣ces, when I shall prooue our excellency and transcending prerogatiues beyond other nations. And thus much for our glory.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>Oncerning the happinesse of a nation, what <NOTE PLACE="marg">The happi∣nesse of our countrey.</NOTE> Kingdome hath more commodities within it selfe, wanteth lesse, or is better furnished from forraine parts? so that whether for profits sake, the strangers of other countries make sale of their best things, or that there is a secret in transportation, or that custome or cunning hath taught our marchants, euen curiosity it selfe, in selecting the choycest things, I know not, but am sure our <HI>England</HI> is the shop of the world, and <HI>London</HI> the <HI>Magazin</HI> of natures dainties. But to particulars; if it bee a blessing for euery man to eat vnder his owne roofe, to sit with the pleasure of conuersation in his orchard or garden, to enioy the fruits of the earth with plenty, to liue in neighbourly gra∣tuities: and in a manner our doores open all night, to haue many children, seruants, and store of cattle, to purchase great estates, marry our daughters beyond expectation, and strengthen one another in worthy families and pre∣uailing affinity: looke amongst vs, and tell mee where is the like? If it be a blessing not to be suppressed with supe∣riours, not to haue the Common-wealth rent in peeces with tyrannie, not to see others enioy the fruits of our la∣bours, not to be tormented with intrusion, vsurpation, or malicions lookes of ouer-couetous Land-Lords: looke amongst vs, and demand who can complaine, or at least,
<PB N="252" REF="133"/>
who is so wronged, but hee may haue satifaction or re∣dresse. If it be a blessing to enioy the preaching of the Go∣spell, to be free from corrupting and absurd ceremonies, to reioyce in the liberty of vpright consciences, to conti∣nue in a true, perfect, and established religion (as heereaster shall be more amply explained) to abound with reuerend learned men, to haue liberall accesse, and dispute of our faith with moderate perswading and disswading, and to haue all controuersies tried vpon the touch-stone of Gods truth; come and heare vs, and tell me wherein you are vn∣satisfied. If it bee a blessing to haue sociable conuersati∣on, and yet with honourable respect to continue the free∣dome of neighbourly meetings, exempted from this in∣tolerable yoake of iealousie and suspition, to loue one an∣other with those comfortable conditions of charity, to seast without scandall, to entertaine without repining, and to be merry without lasciuiousnesse? Examine the di∣sposition of vs all generally, and setting mens imperfecti∣ons aside, which follow life, as the shadow the sunne, and tell me where is lesse offence in so great fulnesse offelicity. If it be a blessing to make the best vse of natures blessings, to be rather helpfull, then indigent of others help, to be at peace with all the Kingdomes of the world, to haue con∣fining Princes gratefie vs by Embasie, to haue the greatest Monarchs allied, or desiring our alliance, to welcome all comers with a noble and correspondent inuitation, and to thriue euery day more &amp; more in the propagation of our worth, Take vp the example, put vs to the triall, and see whether I speake vaine-gloriously. To conclude with the best of all blessings, if it be a blessing to liue in expecta∣tion of a royall succession, to bee confident of hopefull Princes, to haue adioyning countries study our obserua∣tion,
<PB N="253" REF="133"/>
to see our owne country and people flourish with all abundance, and to suspect nothing but the corruptions of greatnesse, through wantonnesse and ease: looke vpon vs; pensill out our defects, if you can, and let not emula∣tion, which sometimes dependeth on vertuous deserts and desires, bee turned into enuy, or so attended on by malice, that you will not yet confesse our neernesse in mat∣ching our example, when I am sure no Kingdome is so beautified with vnstainable colours.</P>
<P>But you will say, for all this, we neither fetch gold from <HI>Ophir,</HI> nor are our cities and buildings of any sufficiency, to hold out against a military expugnation, nor satisfie the high looking eyes of magnificence. To the first, I answer directly, we may if we list, either fetch treasure where it is, or bee the cause, that it shall bee brought vs euen to the doores of our Exchequer in peace. For I am sure, we haue not onely ships and men, but such hands and spirits, as with <HI>Dauids</HI> Worthies, can pull the speares out of the hands of the <HI>Philistims,</HI> and with <HI>Sampsons</HI> riddle take meat out of the eater, and sweetnesse from the strong, and who shall hinder vs? I hope not <HI>Spaine,</HI> if there were such occasion, nor the gallies of the middle-land sea, nor the confederate Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> nor the Turkish <HI>Carmisans</HI> or gallies, nor the fortifications of <HI>China,</HI> nor any one world∣ly Monarch. But see the conditions of true worthinesse; valour and a noble spirit dare doe no wrong, and our ex∣cellent King (out of true addictions to vprightnesse) hath rolled vp all ensignes of defiance, and therefore will not infringe the honourable couenants of his compacted peace, nor giue example to his sonne, to stirre the poole of <HI>Silo,</HI> vntill the Angell descend for the good of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="134"/>
Concerning our buildings and cities: first for the glori∣ousnesse and brauery of them; I answer, <HI>Ars non habet ini∣micum nisi ignorantem,</HI> and men are too preiudicate, that either condemne vs for want of knowledge; or effeminate, that vilipend vs for defect of formality; because of mine owne knowledge, I dare say, generally there are not so many beautifull Churches, handsome castles, glorious palaces, sweet townes, stately houses, and of great capa∣city, and delicate structures, within the circular dimension of so much ground in the world: so that if our Gentle-men (admitting the custome of liuing in cities, as they doe in most parts of <HI>Europe)</HI> would compact all the edefices and conuenient houses of a shire within a wall, or that we were sited in a continent, like the through-fares of <HI>France, Germany,</HI> or <HI>Italy,</HI> we might questionlesse haue more glo∣rious, great, and populous cities, then any one kingdome vnder heauen. Secondly, for the strength; what care wee for extraordinarie fortifications amongst our selues, the onely darings of presumption, and inducements to vnna∣turall treasons, when times and worthy gouernment so curbs the ambitious subiect from any dangerous attempt, that they are so farre from affrighting the Prince, or one another, with factious hostility, that they can quickely v∣nite themselues for the common good: as for the feare of forraine enemies, and inuasion of any enraged foe, wee haue the sea for our walls, the shores as strong as brasse, and such a nauy for our defence, that I protest my heart leaps for ioy, when I see the channell so plentifully stored, the Kings harbours so magnificently filled, and know that all the hauens of the world entertaine vs for one respect or another. But say, we doe not this way put the ambitious man in any hope ofthriuing in fowle pretension offormi∣dable
<PB N="255" REF="134"/>
actions against the peace of our State: or the quiet man in any feare, that well fortified places may be surpri∣zed by treasons, and maintained by power, to the distur∣bance of the whole Realme, and animating forraine Prin∣ces to expect such coadiutement by corrupted and abused men. I am sure we come neerer our example (some fron∣tire townes or speciall landing places excepted) both for hospitality and the generall blessings of the kingdome, reciprocally imparted to poore and rich. And for our o∣ther townes and villages, such as they are, considering the vse and necessity of trauell, surmount by farre the Hoste∣ries and deformed villages of other nations, and am sure, if you let loose the Queen of cities, as you terme <HI>Paris;</HI> the <HI>Sacra Porta;</HI> or the beautifull, as <HI>Constantinople;</HI> the im∣possible within the impossible, as <HI>Venice;</HI> the happy and fashionable, as <HI>Augusta;</HI> the populous, as <HI>Norremberg;</HI> the great, as <HI>Millane;</HI> the delicate, as <HI>Florence;</HI> the Gentle, as <HI>Naples;</HI> the spatious, as <HI>Cracow, Mosco, Cayro,</HI> and tripar∣tite <HI>Prage:</HI> not one of them all (as for infinite other towns, they are not once to be named to this purpose) can looke so bigg, or angerly vpon our LONDON: but shee can affront them with a matching countenance; yea, ouer∣match them in many seuerall exercises and excellencies, wherein for your better instruction we will dispute a little.</P>

<PB N="257" REF="135"/>
Citizens, and Trades-men, the world neuer had such ano∣ther: If you conioyne the suburbs, <HI>Southwarke, Westmin∣ster,</HI> S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Katherines,</HI> and such like, it exceeds <HI>Paris</HI> euen for Inhabitants, or if you will come to vs in a terme time, ac∣cording to our custome of resorting together, I hope you may bee encountred either with hands or swords, as for <HI>Paris,</HI> you know the better halfe, euen of the indwellers, are Gentle-men, Schollers, Lawyers, and belonging to the Cleargy: the Marchant liuing obscurely, the Trades-man penuriously, the Crafts-man in drudgery, and altoge∣ther insolent and rebellious vpon the least distasting, vn∣accustomed impositions, or but affrighted with the altera∣tion of ridiculous ceremonies.

you haue in <HI>London</HI> such a bridge, that without ampliati∣on of particulars, is the admirablest monument, and fir∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/> erected structure in that kinde of the Vniuerse, whe∣ther you respect the foundation, with the continuall charge and orderly endeauours to keepe the arches sub∣stantiall, or examine the vpper buildings, being so many, and so beautifull houses, that it is a pleasure to beholde them, and a fulnesse of contentment to vnderstand their vses conferred vpon them. Insteed of an olde Bastill and ill-beseeming Arsenall, thrust as it were into an outcast corner of the City, you haue in <HI>London</HI> a building of the greatest antiquity and maiesticall forme, seruing to most vses of any Citadle or Magazin that euer you saw. For the Tower containeth a Kings palace, a Kings prison, a Kings armoury, a Kings mint, a Kings ward-robe, a Kings artilery, and many other worthy offices: so that the Inha∣bitants within the walls haue a Church, and are a sufficient parish. Insteed ofan obscure <HI>Louure,</HI> newly graced with an extraordinary gallery, the onely palace of the King neere <HI>Paris.</HI> In <HI>London</HI> his Maiesty hath many houses, parkes, and places of repose, and in the countries dispersed such a number of state, receipt, and commodity, that I protest I am driuen to amaze, knowing the defects of other places, nor doe I heere stretch my discourse on the tenter∣hookes of partiality, or seeme to pull it by the by-strings of selfe-conceit or opinion: but plainely denotate what all true hearted <HI>English-men</HI> can auerre, that to the crowne of our Kingdome are annexed more castles, honors, forrests, parkes, houses of State, and conueniency to retire vnto, from the encombrances of the hurliburly of cities, then any Emperor or King in <HI>Europe</HI> can challenge <HI>proprio iure.</HI> Insteed of an old ruinous palace, as they terme their house
<PB N="259" REF="136"/>
of Parliament, Hall of Iustice, concourse of Lawyers, or meetings of certaine Trades-men or Milleners, like an Ex∣change, and as it were <HI>promiscuè,</HI> confounding all together: we haue in <HI>London</HI> such a <HI>Circo</HI> for Marchants, with an vp∣per quadrant of shops, as must needs subiect it to forraine enuy, in regard of the delicacy of the building, and stateli∣nesse in the contriuing. We haue in <HI>London</HI> a second buil∣ding for the ease of the Court, profit of the Artizan, and glory of the city, which for any thing my outward sence may iudge of, can equall the proudest structure of their proudest townes, though you should name S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Marks Pi∣azza</HI> in <HI>Venice,</HI> for so much building. We haue in <HI>London</HI> a <HI>Guild Hall</HI> for a State-house, and <HI>Westminster</HI> for generall causes of the Kingdome; two such roomes, that without further dispute, maketh strangers demand vnanswerable questions, and gently brought to the vnderstanding parti∣culars, lift vp their hands to heauen and exclaime, O hap∣py <HI>England!</HI> ô happy people! ô happy <HI>London!</HI> and yet I must confesse, that the hall at <HI>Padoa,</HI> and great counsell∣chamber in <HI>Venice,</HI> be roomes of worthy note, and suffici∣ent contentment. We haue in <HI>London</HI> diuers palaces for resort of Lawyers &amp; their Clients, &amp; other offices appro∣priate, all workes rather of ostentation to our selues, then imitation to others. Insteed of narrow dirty streets, neither gracefull to themselues, nor beautified with any orna∣ment, wee haue spacious, large and comely streets, expo∣sing diuers workes of peace, charitie, and estimation. In∣steed of obscure Churches, we haue first the goodliest heap of stones in the world, namely <HI>Pauls;</HI> next the curiousest fabricke in <HI>Europe,</HI> namely <HI>Westminster</HI> chapple, and gene∣rally all our Churches exceede for beauty, handsomnesse, and magnificent building, as framed of hard stone and
<PB N="260" REF="137"/>
marble, and exposed with a firme and glorious spectacle, as for the <HI>Dona</HI> of <HI>Florence,</HI> S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Marcks</HI> in <HI>Venice,</HI> S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Marcks</HI> in <HI>Millane,</HI> the <HI>Noterdame</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> and some others in <HI>Ger∣many</HI> (the steeple onely at <HI>Strasborough</HI> except, which is denominated <HI>Beautifull,</HI> for the height and handsomnesse) they are either buildings of bricke, or conceited structures like a fantasticall bird-cage of a little inlayd or mosaijcke worke, worthy of applause from such as respect new dain∣ties, and not to bee ouerpassed for curious pictures and paintings: where yet by the way you must obserue, that in those daies of superstition, and particulars of ostentation, concerning rich hangings, imageries, statues, altar-cloths, roods, reliques, plate, pictures, and ornaments, other Churches and monasteries of <HI>Europe</HI> come farre short of our glory and Popish brauery. Insteed of Gentle-men on dirty foot-clothes, and women in the miry streets: the one with an idle Lacquey or two; the other with no company of respect: wee haue fashionable attendancy, handsome and comely going, either in Carosse, Coatch, or on horse∣backe, and our Ladies and women of reputation, sildome abroad without an honourable retinue. Insteed of a con∣fusion of all sorts of people together, without discouery of qualitie or persons, as Citizens, Lawyers, Schollers, Gen∣tlemen, religious Priests, and Mechanickes, that you can scarse know the one from the other, nor the master from the man. In <HI>London</HI> the Citizen liues in the best order with very few houses of Gentle-men interposed, and in our suburbs, the Nobility haue so many and stately dwel∣lings, that one side of the riuer may compare with the <HI>Gran Canale</HI> of <HI>Venice.</HI> But if you examine their receipt and capacity, <HI>Venice</HI> and all the cities of <HI>Europe</HI> must sub∣mit to the truth. Nay' in <HI>London</HI> and the places adioy∣ning,
<PB N="261" REF="137"/>
you haue a thousand seuerall houses, wherein I will lodge a thousand seuerall men with conueniency: match vs now if you can. Insteed of a poore <HI>Prouost</HI> and disor∣derly company of Marchants and Trades-men, we haue a <HI>Podesta</HI> or <HI>Maior,</HI> that keepeth a Princely house, wee haue graue Senatours, comely Citizens, seuerall Halls, and au∣thorized Corporations, all gouerned by religious Magi∣stracy, and made famous by triumphant solemnities: so that our best Gentry are delighted with the spectacle, and strangers admire the brauery.</P>
<P>To conclude, if you looke on and in our <HI>London</HI> truly, as it is composed of men following trades &amp; occupations, there is not such a city, such a gouernment, such a method of conuersation, such a vnity of good fellowship, such a glasse to see vnity and beauty in, such a treasury of wealth, such a store-house of all terrestriall blessings vnder the sunne. If you will view it without at all times, and yet consider the customes of keeping our country houses, you will say there are not so manie Gentle-men in anie place, nor gathered together to better purpose, nor can the varie∣tie of <HI>Paris</HI> bring you into the walks of such pleasure, with so little charge and offence, as <HI>London.</HI> For with vs our riding of horses, musique, learning of all Arts and Scien∣ces, dancing, fencing, seeing of commedies or interludes, banquets, masques, mummeries, turnaiments, shewes, lotteries, feasts, ordinarie meetings, and all the particulars of mans inuention to satiate delight, are easie expences, and a little iudgement with experience, will manage a ve∣ry meane estate to wade through the current of pleasure, although it runne to voluptuousnesse. But if you come to our Court, I hope you finde not such another for stately attendants, dutifull seruice, plentie of fare, resort of No∣bles,
<PB N="262" REF="138"/>
comelinesse of Ladies, gallantrie of Gentles, con∣course of people, princely pastimes, noble entertainment, and all things befitting the Maiestie of a King, or glorie of a nation: so that I may say for <HI>London,</HI> as the King of <HI>France</HI> answered the Emperors tedious titles with <HI>France, France, France,</HI> and nothing but <HI>France:</HI> so crie I <HI>London, London, London,</HI> and nothing but <HI>London,</HI> to their proudest and all their cities. And thus much for <HI>Paris:</HI> now to <HI>Constantinople.</HI></P>
<P>What I haue said of <HI>Paris</HI> by way of comparison, con∣cerning <NOTE PLACE="marg">Constanti∣nople descri∣bed, and compared with London</NOTE> the gouernment and orderly managing the af∣faires of a citie, I may well conclude against <HI>Constantinople:</HI> but because this imperiall place looketh with a more ma∣iesticall countenance then other cities, and lifteth vp (as it were) a daring head against all contradiction, for her supe∣rioritie: I must needes pensill out the line of her praises at some length, and tell you truely, wherein her worthinesse consisteth, and yet may deceiue opinion without true iudgement. <HI>Constantinople,</HI> otherwise called <HI>Stanbole,</HI> the Beautifull, hath a handsome and formall triangle of a wall, the first part whereof reacheth from the seuen towers (which is a place for suppliment of a prison, a treasurie, and ward-robe) vnto the <HI>Seralio,</HI> some three English mile. The second from the <HI>Seralio</HI> to <HI>Porta del Fieume,</HI> a little more and both toward the sea, which runneth one way be∣tweene <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Europe</HI> into the <HI>Euxinum,</HI> and another way to encounter a pretty fresh water riuer, beyond the North of <HI>Pera.</HI> And the third ouerlooketh the fields of <HI>Thracia,</HI> with a greater compasse and strength, because it is a double wall, and openeth three or foure gates, as <HI>Andri∣nople, Gratianople,</HI> the Tower gate, &amp;c. into the countrey, which flourished when <HI>Pausanias</HI> was contented with the
<PB N="263" REF="138"/>
title of Duke and Captaine of the <HI>Spartanes,</HI> and built this wonderfull towne by the name of <HI>Bizantium,</HI> in honour of his father <HI>Bize,</HI> who was Admirall of the Grecian Nauy, when <HI>Thebes,</HI> and other cities stroue for superiority. The wal is orderly beautified with square towers of hard stone, whose equall distance makes a reasonable shew, but that it resembles a painted Curtezan of outward good becom∣ming, yet within full of corruption and danger. For con∣cerning the streets, citizens, houses, or order of a well com∣pacted Common-wealth, it retaineth nothing comming neere our <HI>London,</HI> or happinesse. The situation is yet a stately ascent from the sea, as if it had a pride to mocke at the swelling of any tempest: and embolden the Marchant with the security of the <HI>Sacra Porta,</HI> being indeede the goodliest habour in the world, twenty fathom deep close to the shores of two cities. Thus it containeth ten English mile in circumference, hauing no suburbs, and shewing much waste ground in the vnfrequented places toward the land, especially where the Bashawes houses are seque∣stred from the hurliburly of the Trades-man.</P>
<P>The <HI>Seralio</HI> is the palace of the <HI>Gran Signeur,</HI> yet is a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Why Seralio</NOTE> name appropriate to diuers sequestred places, wherein his women are detained, and hath questionlesse the deriuation from our Latin word <HI>Sera,</HI> or locked vp: it is a receptacle for diuers thousands, enclosing as much ground, as S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Iames</HI> parke. For the courts are very large, with seuerall guards of <HI>Ianizaries,</HI> according to the necessity of the times, or neernesse to the Emperours person. The gardens spacious, with embattelled walls, stored with artillery, the gates most of them iron, kept by <HI>Capogies:</HI> the buildings are many and stately, bearing in their front certaine <HI>Dowa∣na's</HI> or open hals, which haue trauesses of Persian stuffe, and
<PB N="264" REF="139"/>
are roomes of great receipt, wherein the officers of the pa∣lace sit in open view at their feasts and diet. The ban∣quetting-houses, wherein his concubines and boyes are aparted from the court hurliburly, expose diuers manner of structures, and seeme indeede seuerall palaces, amongst whom there is one called a <HI>Caska</HI> without the wall of the <HI>Seralio</HI> close to the sea-side where hee accustometh to take his gally, of the delicatest and richest presence, that euer I beheld: for it is a quadrant of seuen arches on a side cloy∣ster wise, like the <HI>Rialto</HI> walke in <HI>Venice,</HI> in the midst riseth a core of three or foure roomes with chimnies, whose mantell trees are of siluer, the windowes curiously glazed, &amp; besides protected with an iron grate all guilt ouer most gloriously: the whole frame so set with opals, rubies, eme∣ralds, burnisht with golde, painted with flowers, and gra∣ced with inlayed worke of porphery, marble, iet, iasper, and delicate stones, that I am perswaded there is not such a bird cage in the world. Vnder the walls are stables for sea horses called <HI>Hippopotami,</HI> which is a monstrous beast taken in <HI>Nilus,</HI> Elephants, Tygres, and Dolphines: sometimes they haue Crocadiles and Rhinoceros: within are Roe∣buckes, white Partridges, and Turtles, the bird of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and many beasts and fowles of <HI>Affrica</HI> and <HI>India.</HI> The walkes are shaded with Cypres, Cedars, Turpentine, and trees which wee onely know by their names, amongst which, such as affoord sustenance, are called figs, almonds, oliues, pomegranets, limons, orenges, and such like: but it should seeme, they are heere as it were enforced, and kept in order with extraordinary diligence: for the sunne kisseth them not with that freuency, as may make them large, or ripen in their proper kindes.</P>
<P>The city is very populous toward the harbour, the <HI>Be∣sesteine,</HI>
<PB N="265" REF="139"/>
Bashawes houses, Mosques, conduits, tombs and monuments, open as it were a store-house of magnificent workes: yet when I read, that <HI>Constantine</HI> vnplumed <HI>Rome,</HI> and as it were robbed all the world, making this place accessary to the theft, and cannot finde the particu∣lars in mine inuentory, I maruell who hath either dared to purloine them, or presumed to ruinate and deface them. For the cheefest structures and monuments are now the great <HI>Seralio,</HI> the lesser <HI>Seralio's,</HI> the seuen towres, the dou∣ble wall, diuers Bashawes houses, before some of which are spacious quadrants graced with antiquities, recording the ancient manner of turnaiments, when the <HI>Greekes</HI> flou∣rished: the Mosques or Temples, amongst whom the <HI>So∣phia, Solimana</HI> and <HI>Amorata,</HI> are indeed heaps of ostenta∣tion and fabricks of great delight, the place called <HI>Iobs</HI> tombe, sequestred for the buriall of the Emperours chil∣dren, who are commonly all strangled on the day of his elder sonnes inauguration by <HI>Mutes,</HI> and then enclosed in coffins of Cypres, and so receiued by the <HI>Mufti</HI> into chap∣ples consecrated for that purpose; the Patriarcks house; certaine <HI>Balnea's; Aquae ductus; Constantines</HI> palace; and the Towers on the wall. To these you may adde the <HI>Be∣sesteine,</HI> a place like our Exchange, for varietie of marchan∣dize, market of virgins, selling of slaues, and the vaults vn∣der ground fenced with iron gates to secure their treasure, which especially belongeth to the <HI>Iewes,</HI> who farme the office of <HI>Dacij</HI> or customes, and are (as it were) the <HI>Turkes</HI> receiuers, so that these places must needes bee strongly guarded, both to preuent the furie of the <HI>Ianizaries,</HI> who are very irregular in their tumults, and the extremity of fire and earth-quakes, to whose violence the Citie is many times subiect.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="140"/>
The next diuision is of <HI>Galata,</HI> a city ouer against it diui∣ded onely by sea, no broader heere then our <HI>Tamisis,</HI> of great antiquity, walled about, and retaining a particular name and renowne, for holding out a yeere and better, af∣ter <HI>Constantinople</HI> was surprized: it standeth likewise vp a hill, and equals it both for beastlinesse, confusion, and vn∣comely streets and houses: heere liue many <HI>Greekes,</HI> and the <HI>Francks,</HI> as they terme the Papists (of what nation soe∣uer) haue a Church by permission; the Curtezan likewise liueth at some liberty; yet is it death for any Christian to lie with a Turkish woman or Iew.</P>
<P>The third part of this great city comprehendeth the vine of <HI>Pera,</HI> which is a huge suburbs, compassing <HI>Galata</HI> round about, a place of quiet dwelling, good aire, and pleasant gardens: yet in regard the many thousand tombs of <HI>Turkes</HI> (for you must know, that neither <HI>Turke, Iew,</HI> nor <HI>Christian,</HI> interre any corps in their Mosques or city, ex∣cept they build a chapple of purpose, or haue the priui∣ledge of the Franck Church) fill vp a great quantity of ground, with disordered, confused noysome, and feare∣full graues. On the one side toward the north-east, you haue an Arsenall for gallies, a little beyond, a handsome Seralio, &amp; somwhat further a pretty fresh water riuer, as if they lay in sequence, by whose banks are certaine houses erected of purpose, for the pleasure &amp; reposednes of spe∣ciall Bashawes. On the other side toward the south-west, the office of artilery called <HI>Tapinaw,</HI> inuiteth you to the view of such ordnance and munition, that for number, greatnesse, and vse, surmount any one city of <HI>Europe:</HI> you haue likewise another Seralio, and in these suburbs are re∣sident the <HI>English, French,</HI> and <HI>Venetian</HI> Ambassadours: as for the <HI>Persian,</HI> Emperours of <HI>Germany,</HI> and <HI>Polacks,</HI> they
<PB N="267" REF="140"/>
liued in the great city, and sometimes visited one another, as either necessitie of businesse, or pleasure of inuitation affoorded.</P>
<P>The last quarter of this diuision affoordeth the obiect of a towne in <HI>Asia</HI> called <HI>Scideron,</HI> or <HI>Scideret,</HI> betweene which and <HI>Constantinople,</HI> the sea runneth 20. English mile in length, and onely two in bredth, as farre as <HI>Pompey's</HI> pil∣lar and the blacke Tower, resembling a lace fringed with spangles and purles: for the Bashawes and Chawses hou∣ses, so stand on both sides, as if they were made to answer a proportion of handsomnesse: but when time and a daies trauell hath taken away the pleasure of this spectacle, then fall you into a larger gulph, once called <HI>Euxinum mare,</HI> now the blacke sea, extending a thousand mile, as farre as <HI>Trebisond:</HI> on the farther shore of the continent now called <HI>Russia,</HI> is shouldred vp close <HI>Maeotis Palus;</HI> into which the great riuer of <HI>Tanais</HI> sendeth his streames, as if a messenger of glad tydings and businesse should hasten to discharge his duty. Thus I confesse, if on the towers of the <HI>Amorata,</HI> or battlements of the <HI>Sophia,</HI> you beheld all at once, as it were one vnited body, it would equall, if not surpasse <HI>London,</HI> for spaciousnesse of grounds, some monuments, and diuers palaces and houses: but yet come no way neere my satisfaction, as being defectiue in many things, which I supposed to excell in it, &amp; deficient in all things, wherin a happy countrey supplieth the wants of her enhabitants. For heere is neither good lodging, proportionable fare, free recourse, gracious entertainment, true religion, secure abiding, allowable pleasure, orderly gouernment, or any thing wherein a noble city is made glorious indeed: nor is it so populous as report hath busied vs, but <HI>famarialum,</HI> and it may be, the plague hauing consumed 80000. and
<PB N="268" REF="141"/>
the army of 200000. deducted, diminished somewhat the glory, &amp; left the rest of the people to enioy more free∣dome. And thus much for <HI>Constantinople.</HI> Now a word or two for <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Venice</HI> I confesse is both rare in situation, and wonderfull for gouernment, as cementing together diuers Ilands with <NOTE PLACE="marg">Venice de∣scribed, and compared with London</NOTE> small bridges, and not trusting their liberty either into the the hands of one Prince, or iudgement of inferiour per∣sons. Thus hath the Duke but a binding voyce, and the sword is carried before the Senate: thus is nothing done without the consent of the Nobility, who are very neere 1500. in number, and the trades-man is in no sort admit∣ted amongst them, till either he purchase the freedome, or deserue it by some heroicke imployment; therefore they doe them wrong, that call the <HI>Venetians</HI> marchants. For though some of them haue a traffique at sea: yet doe the better sort of the Nobility scorne to trade for profit, and those which are aduenturers, are either newly raised hou∣ses, or licensed by the state for speciall purposes: but how∣soeuer, hee leaues the managing of affaires to inferiours, and the drudging (as we say) for money, either to the Iew as an Vsurer; or to common banke for the good of the city; or to the Shop-keeper, for the entertaining the con∣course of people, sitting at home in ease, and going abroad for some variety of delight, as the true Gentle-men of <HI>Na∣ples</HI> and <HI>Millane</HI> accustome, who suppose nothing wor∣thy, which sauours of curbing liberty, and tying them to seruile attendance. But yet in all this, so farre short of our <HI>London,</HI> as a dumb painted statua of a liuing substance. For neither are the Noble-men permitted the eminency of o∣ther natious, nor patible of such degrees, as our greatnesse looketh vpon one another withall: nor can the Marchant
<PB N="269" REF="141"/>
equall the twentieth part of our comparison for number: nor in that which they boast of, which is wealth, can they generally match our <HI>Londoners:</HI> as for the Trades-man and Shop-keepers, as I sayd before, neither for order, go∣uernment, libertie of meeting, diet, purchasing of land, de∣licate furniture, and all the particulars whereby a city is made famous, worthy, or wealthy: onely some few hou∣ses haue a handsome shew of comelinesse, and (according to the custome of their stone-buildings) seeme pretty piles for the receipt of a small company. But where are their fiue hundred ships at sea; when all <HI>Venice</HI> hath not aboue thirty marchant men, and ten galleasses; onely they boast of three hundred gallies, according to the custome of <HI>Na∣uall</HI> encounters in the <HI>Leuant?</HI> where are their voyages and setled aboad in all the harbours in the world? where are their large and braue streets, antique monuments, when their city is scarse eight hundred yeere old, glorious gates, magnificent structures to lodge Princes and all their reti∣nue, houses of entertainment for trauellers and strangers, such as our Tauernes and Inns? where are their conduits and good waters? where are their fields and pleasant walkes? where are their exercises and heroike pastimes? where are their triumphant shewes and magnificent specta∣cles, with infinite other particulars, wherein they must yeeld, if <HI>London</HI> had no other Commander then the Maior and Senatours? after this manner could I runne into <HI>Affrick,</HI> and fetch <HI>Cayro;</HI> into <HI>Russia,</HI> for <HI>Mosko;</HI> into <HI>Po∣land,</HI> for <HI>Craccow;</HI> into <HI>Germany,</HI> for <HI>Augusta,</HI> or <HI>Norrem∣berg;</HI> into <HI>Bohemia,</HI> for <HI>Prage;</HI> into <HI>Austria,</HI> for <HI>Vienna;</HI> into <HI>Spaine,</HI> for <HI>Leon,</HI> or <HI>Madrid;</HI> into <HI>Portugall,</HI> for <HI>Lisbone;</HI> and so in all the rest: but if they were brought before the barre of comparison, they might bee quickly arraigned of

presumption for contending with our <HI>London</HI> in any of those things, wherein a city looketh vp with a iustifiable countenance, to shew her comelinesse, beauty, glory, bra∣uery or antiquity. But see what it is to embolden a for∣ward man; I am not yet satisfied, vntill I tell you diuers stranger things, and so open the enclosures of knowledge, that you shall enfeoff her with many excellencies, wherin our <HI>England</HI> is truely imparadized before all nations.</P>

<P>In the 26 of <HI>Leuiticus</HI> idolatry is forbidden againe, and the very making of images reputed an vnanswerable sinne; and because the policie of man should be quite defeated, the eternall prouidence is contented to yeeld reasons for the same in the 4 of <HI>Deuteronomie</HI> 15: yea such sufficient reasons, that we may conclude them posi∣tiue lawes to all Nations. First in the third verse, to pre∣uent <NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons why we should not commit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>iolatry.</NOTE> their destruction, lest they might vtterly perish, as they did, because of <HI>Baal Peor.</HI> Secondly, because it was wisdome and vnderstanding, wherein the naturall man delighted, to keepe the ordinance of God, vers. 6.

Fourth∣ly, because the lawes of God were better, more vpright, and had a fuller iustice in them than the lawes of other Nations, v. 8.

Seuenthly, because God was angry with <HI>Moses</HI> for speaking in their behalfe, when they had worshipped the golden calfe in <HI>Horeb,</HI> and punished him for their sakes, with debarring him from entring into the land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> v. 21. Eight∣ly, and last of all, because they might be blessed in perfor∣ming the will of God, whom they knew to be the onely true God, v. 35. Wherevpon when the Iewes were to take possession of the land of the Gentiles, although it might be intended, that there could not be wrought an vtter extirpation at the first; yet did the spirit of God co∣uenant with them, that they should not be at atonement with their abominations, but destroy their idols vtterly: yea a litle further, the very places where the idols were to be erected are to be abandoned, as if he should then say, I will be worshipped, as I command, and not as mans fan∣cy deludeth, wherevpon followed that great curse against the inticers, and seducers to idolatry, and the Magistrates had a strict commandement to preuent the planting of groues and trees, the very nurses of heathenish invention, and to hinder the occasions of solitarie sequestration, whereby were practised <HI>Diabolicall</HI> arts, <HI>Pithonisticall</HI> in∣cantations, <HI>Cabalisticall</HI> secrets, <HI>Hieroglyphicall</HI> representa∣tions, imposturing deuises, and all dangerous sacrifices belonging to the formall perfecting the same.</P>
<P>This that is alleaged might be sufficient to vnderstan∣ding men to affright them from affecting either idoll, image, or church-painting: But I will goe a litle further, and wade in the foord of this swelling streame, which from the springs of the Prophets ouerflow the fields of all countries: but how? euen by shouldring aside the proud cast-vp-banks of opposition, and threatning Gods venge∣ance

So that if I store this discourse with some collected ab∣stracts, intimating nothing from enuy, or malice against the greatnes and wealth of other Kingdomes, which are Idolaters, I hope we shall thereby auoide in our selues the least sauouring of those monstrous customes of <HI>India, China,</HI> or other dangerous Kingdomes, and adulterate ex∣cuses <NOTE PLACE="marg">The foolish excuse of Idolaters.</NOTE> of misled Christians, who thus farre agree with the grossest idolaters, that their images are but representati∣ons of more excellent spirits, and no man is so senselesse to kneele to, or adore the dumbe and dead things, but onely to resuscitate our stupide memories, either of God, or his Saints, in regard the nature of man is so slender of it selfe, and the condition of the Diety so gentle to giue way to any thing, which may further the adoration of his glory, and the confirmation of our saluation: in both which how grosse and palpably they abuse the great and wise God, and deceiue ignorant and simple men, shall here appeare.</P>
<P>In the 17. of <HI>Deuteronomie</HI> there is as it were a solemne quest of enquiry against the peruerters of true religion in this kinde, and the conclusion tendeth to the punishment of stoning to death; and because we should haue no star∣ting hole or tricke to deceiue our selues, God is contented in the 28 to establish to his people a contract of blessing, and cursing, all tending to discouer the vses and reasons of either: following it so farre, that he plainely nameth idolatry, or if you will, erecting of images, for any cause to exasperate his displeasure, that plagues, punishment, and vtter extirpation must follow: to which end and purpose <HI>Iosua's</HI> exhortation for the worshipping the one∣ly, true, and wise God, and after his owne onely, true, and
<PB N="275" REF="144"/>
wise way, was so enlarged, commended, and applauded after his so many and great victories, and established qui∣etnes. How neere to vtter destruction, and desolation, were the <HI>Israelites</HI> in the time of the IVDGES, when the Angell rebuked the people for liuing wickedly in the sight of the Lord, and seruing <HI>Baalam,</HI> wherevpon follow∣ed a casting them away by God, and the hands of <HI>Midian</HI> fettred them in chaines seuen yeere: nor could the Princes of <HI>Iuda</HI> deliuer them, although <HI>Gedeon</HI> began well, and set vp preuailing on his strongest legs, to stand vpright for their behoofe. But what followed? He and all his house fell into the pit of destruction: and wherefore? for making an ephod, wherein hee presumed yet to doe well; but it was the step and staire of idolatry, and that the cause of a following vengeance; then if you looke into <HI>Micahs</HI> story, you shall finde that euery man did what was good in his owne eyes, whereby ensued murthers, rapes, robberies, and such like intolerable enormities, all hauing their cur∣rent from this spring, that his mother made him images of siluer, and he consented to the wicked worke. If you ouerlooke the story of <HI>Sampson,</HI> howeuer hee lost his strength, and was inflicted with a seuere punishment, of being bereaued of his sight, and disgracefull captiuity; yet you saw, as the Eagle casts her bill to renew her youth, for the punishment of Idolaters, God raised vp another wall of fortification, and when his vigour was restored, he pul∣led downe the prophane temple vpon the heads of two thousand soules: when the <HI>Philistins</HI> brought the arke of God into the house of <HI>Dagon,</HI> the Idoll fell downe before it, and the men of <HI>Ashdod</HI> were plagued for abusing the same.

him? vntill he fell to idolatry, then did his priuate e∣nemies cast it out of sight, and God diuided ten Tribes from his sonne, which was a strange disparity, considering his father built the Temple, consecrated the same, and blessed the people. Wherein was God so offended with <HI>Ieroboam,</HI> that he made him the capitall authour of the sins of <HI>Israel?</HI> but by reason of his golden calues, the punish∣ment whereof was thus farre extended; His sonne died, his hand was dried vp with leprosie, the seduced Prophet was killed by a Lyon, and the same <HI>Abiah</HI> that made him King, confirmed the extirpation of his family, and for all his wife went to delude him, yet she heard the iudgement of terrour, which she could not preuent. In the story of <HI>Ahab,</HI> what was the cause of so many troubles in <HI>Israel,</HI> tyranny in the Common-wealth, murthering of Gods Prophets, vsurpation of other mens inheritances, wicked∣nesse of <HI>Iezabel,</HI> witchcrafts, whoredomes, and in the end a generall defection from his obedience, and coniuration against his house, was it not idolatry? wherupon followed the slaughter of the King, the casting the Queene out of a window, the killing of <HI>Baals</HI> Prophets, first by <HI>Eliah,</HI> then by <HI>Iehu,</HI> and an vtter confusion in <HI>Iuda</HI> and <HI>Israel.</HI></P>

<PB N="277" REF="145"/>
<HI>Shallum</HI> by <HI>Menahen,</HI> and <HI>Menahen</HI> purchased his peace of <HI>Assyria</HI> by money. The wicked idolatry of <HI>Ahas,</HI> and that horrible consecration of his sonne in fire, was a motiue of trouble and desolation to all <HI>Ierusalem. Hosea</HI> King of <HI>Is∣rael</HI> was ensnared, and he and his realme caught in the net of Assyrian policy, by reason of their confidence in Idols, &amp; that euery one worshipped the God of his nation, con∣trary to <HI>Moses</HI> Law; but what ensued? curses, plagues, vt∣ter desolatenesse, adumbration of the sunne-shine of hea∣uenly fauours, and when they presumed of well-doing, in making a hotchpotch of religion in <HI>Samaria,</HI> the Lyons of the forrest came into the city, and deuoured both Priests and people.</P>

<P><HI>Ezekiels</HI> visions were most against <HI>Israel,</HI> and his mouth opened the fearefull indignation of the Lord against <HI>Ieru∣salem,</HI> because their altars were erected to strange Gods, and that they made images of the sunne, to pollute their soules worse then the carrion of a dunghill: then procee∣deth he against them with personating names, calling <HI>Sa∣maria</HI> and <HI>Ierusalem, Aholah</HI> and <HI>Ohalibah:</HI> the end onely to discouer their idolatry, and intimating Gods wrath for their notorious wandring from the true path of know∣ledge, insomuch that from the parable of a seething pot, <HI>Iuda's</HI> destruction is threatned: yet for all this, God will not condescend to any treatise of pacification, vntil all the nations round about, namely <HI>Edom, Moab, Aegypt, Chaldea, Tyrus, Sidon, Gog,</HI> and <HI>Magog,</HI> taste the bitternesse of the same fruit, corrupted and made irksome by the same trans∣gressions.</P>

There is scarse one chapter in the booke of wisdome, which doth not pensill out the grosse and palpable running a whoring af∣ter the ridiculous adoration of images. To conclude, our Sauiour, the Euangelists and Apostles preach, that the true worshipping of God consisteth in spirituall deuotion, not wordly or carnall circumstances, and inueigh against no∣thing more then mens traditions, the obseruing the out∣ward letter, the adhering to ceremonies, and with <HI>Martha</HI> leauing the most needefull thing to bee encombred with worldly vanities and beastly corruptions, to which if you adde that excellent reuelation, it is a plaine discouery of <HI>Antechrist,</HI> and how the westerne Churches should be in∣fected with the contagious diseases of trumperies, idola∣try, and diuellish interpretation of Scriptures, I durst say a Iewish contradiction of the truth, and Apostate falling from the maine building of Gods Church.

But because we hope for our established saluation in the merits and mercies of Iesus Christ, and know, that the excellency of the Trinity is described in the old Te∣stament, when God said, <HI>Let vs make man,</HI> when the great King saw the image of one like the sonne of man in the furnace, when <HI>Iob</HI> knew that his Redeemer liued, &amp; when the mysterie of the Trinitie is reuealed in many places: let vs leaue the vanitie of the Heathen with their obstina∣cie, the abomination of Idolaters with their grosse abuses, the antiquity of the Iewes with their stiffneckednesse, the innouation of the Mahumetans with their errors and im∣possibilities, and be onely proud of our liuery of Christi∣ans. But now we must subdiuide againe, and say, that a∣mongst
<PB N="283" REF="148"/>
Christians there is a tripartite separation. For the Greeke Church runneth one way with the title of East: the Latine Church rangeth another way with the deno∣mination of West: and the reformed Church spreadeth a modest glory with the liberty of Protestants.</P>
<P>Concerning the Greeke Church I will be bold to tell you, that I haue heard some of their Protopapans and Archimandritans maintaine their greatnesse, precedency, and truenesse of Religion before the Latine, and thus they assume the defence. For greatnesse it containeth most parts of <HI>Armenia, Georgia, Mengrelia</HI> neere the <HI>Caspian,</HI> many places in <HI>Natolia,</HI> or <HI>Asia minor,</HI> the Countries of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The great∣nesse of the Creeke Church.</NOTE> <HI>Aethiopia</HI> in <HI>Affricke,</HI> which may equall them of the West <HI>Indies,</HI> of whom the Pope doth now boast so much: In <HI>Europe</HI> all <HI>Grecia:</HI> many great Ilands (except such as are diuerted Papists, incurring the scandall of Heretickes) <HI>Muscouia</HI> or <HI>Russia:</HI> some parts of <HI>Poland, Lithuania, Bogdonia,</HI> and the shores of the <HI>Euxinum,</HI> much more ground, then the Pope can challenge, where he is the most offen siue Vsurper.</P>
<P>For Precedency it claimeth likewise the prerogatiue, both waies: First, by priority, in regard they were first <NOTE PLACE="marg">The prece∣dency of the Greeke Church.</NOTE> Christians, and the Apostles planted Churches amongst them, before either <HI>Paul</HI> preached at <HI>Rome,</HI> or <HI>Linus</HI> was appointed Byshoppe. Secondly, by authority, as by translation of the Empire, from whence <HI>Rome</HI> challengeth hers: For when there was no such ambition thought vpon <HI>Iohn Patriarch</HI> of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> vsurped the title of vni∣uersall Byshoppe, and practised the supremacy ouer all other Churchmen, by reason the Emperour <HI>Constantine</HI> had so enobled and enabled the great Citie, where hee would haue the Byshoppe to be principall in regard of the
<PB N="284" REF="149"/>
maiesty of his person and the brauery of the place, and therefore not onely graced him with the elated title of Patriarch, but inuested him with many roialties, and pal∣laces, and temporall iurisdictions, to which the Byshoppe of <HI>Rome</HI> did then intercede, interposing a negatiue euen a∣gainst the very title, disprouing it as Antichristian, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gregory sur∣named the Great.</NOTE> traduced <HI>Iohn</HI> the Patriarch, as a wicked and malicious man for practising such ostentation: nor desisted he so, but writ whole volumes of letters tending to a manner of de∣famation: some entreating him to disclaime such elation of heart: some disalowing the presumption, as exorbitant in a Byshoppe, who should rather imitate the humilitie of Christ: some thundring the cursed prediction of Anti∣christ by such apostacy, and all of them disswading the true Ministers of Gods word from poysoning their pre∣ciously redeemed soules with the venome of pride, and vaine-glory: then followed the fearefull history of <HI>Nau∣clerus</HI> a strong papisticall writer, on whom they lay the imputation of a fable: But he saies plainely, that that ve∣ry instant, in which <HI>Constantine</HI> the great enfeoffed the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Nauclerus.</NOTE> Church with temporary lands, and sumptuous edifices, the heauens seemed to frowne, the aire was thickned with a cloude, the earth troubled with a tempest, and after great thunder and lightning, a voice was heard; now is poyson throwne into the pure streame of Gods truth. Vpon this the matter was a while respited with a grant on∣ly of sitting downe first at generall Councells, naming in Commissions, and the binding voice in equality of censu∣ring; all which, if they were priuiledges, enlarged first the precedency of the Patriarch of <HI>Constantinople.</HI></P>
<P>Afterward, when the sinnes of the Empire, like a fluent streame ouer-spread the bankes of his enclosures, and that
<PB N="285" REF="149"/>
God determined the vtter subuersion of all: two wicked men contriued the most lamentable desolation, both of the gouernment of the Empire, &amp; religion of the Church, which were <HI>Phocas</HI> and <HI>Bonifacius;</HI> the one conspiring thus with the other against God and Angells, against hea∣uen and earth, against men and Deuills, that to establish <HI>Phocas</HI> in the Empire of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> he would be con∣tented, that <HI>Bonifacius</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> should be consecrated with the title of Vniuersall Byshoppe; whereupon <HI>Phocas</HI> by the murther of his Master <HI>Mauritius</HI> and other inhumane treacheries was inuested Lord of the Easterne Monarchy, and <HI>Bonifacius</HI> by the cousoning his Predecessor <HI>Siluester,</HI> and other religious practises obtained the papacy: inso∣much that <HI>Platina</HI> and diuers of their owne writers (a∣mongst other pasquills and satiricall inuections) exclaime, that he came in like a fox, raigned as a lyon, and died like a dogge: so that all premises considered, if there be a ne∣cessitie in any such precedency, the Roman Byshoppes be but vsurpers. For <HI>Constantinople</HI> had it at generall Coun∣cells, and was permitted all the fauour of titles, which the Church, and most Christian Emperour collated at that time.</P>
<P>Concerning the truth, it is well knowne, that <HI>Peter</HI> of whom they boast so much was Byshoppe of <HI>Antioch</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The verity of the Greek Church.</NOTE> 20. yeares, and those of <HI>Asia</HI> the first reputed Christians in the world; so that euen from Scripture it selfe and <HI>Pauls</HI> perigrination, many plentifull collections enlarge his history and life with warrantable knowledge of what we must trust vnto. As for his visiting of <HI>Rome,</HI> howeuer <HI>Eusebius</HI> adhereth to some formall discoueries, and other Authors produce instances of his owne death and daugh∣ters Martyrdome vnder <HI>Nero,</HI> it is both fanaticall, imagi∣nary,
<PB N="286" REF="150"/>
and vnwarrantable by Scripture: nay I will say more, neither by collected circumstances, probable con∣iectures, or authenticall Authors is there any inducement to beleeue it: But say he did visit <HI>Rome,</HI> and conferred with <HI>Paul,</HI> what sense, reason, or honesty can allow the transla∣tion of his owne Byshopricke out of <HI>Asia</HI> into <HI>Europe,</HI> an intrusion into another mans iurisdiction. For <HI>Paul</HI> was constituted to be the light of the Gentiles, and lost his head at <HI>Rome</HI> in iustifying his innocency: how then could <HI>Peter</HI> be condemned of so functory a negligence, that be∣ing appointed to the dispersed Iewes of <HI>Asia,</HI> hee would vilipend them, and intrude himselfe into the gouernment of the Gentiles of <HI>Italy:</HI> so then considering <HI>Antioch</HI> and the 7. Churches spoken of in the <HI>Apocalips,</HI> were the first receiuers of the Gospell, from whence the Greekes in <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> were the next embracers of the truth, who can oppose against her residence and conseruation rather, where it was first published, then in <HI>Italy,</HI> and the remoter places of <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> whereas yet some of their Countries are not quite purged from Paganisme.</P>
<P>Thus doe they dispute, and with stomachous ardency enueigh against the pompous and ostentous glory of the latine Church, putting them to silence, as our Sauiour did the Pharisies, when hee questioned their opinion of <HI>Iohns</HI> baptisme, &amp; exprobrated them for aduancing the <HI>Hidra's</HI> head of confusion through enormous ceremonies, and mens traditions, wherein they saw the inconueniences be∣fore their faces, that they were not onely patible of altera∣tion, but would grow in time to a Congeries and moun∣taine of deformitie, as men &amp; deuises did augment them: notwithstanding time being weary of stabilitie, and the Deuill affraid of impeachment in his kingdome, hath

For all the Greeke Churches are very small, full of idle painting, lampes, candles, tapers, and such like: their seruice and language Greeke, and when they write or print it is a reasonable good Character, though farre from the atticke Dialect: and yet I will be bold to say, a good Scholler of our gram∣mer instruction, shall scarce vnderstand the phrase of their common speakers, no more then a southerne man, one borne farre north, or in Scotland. Their Monasteries are poore, vnhansome, and farre from the state of the Romish Church; and surely if in any thing they imitate the Apo∣stles, it is in their scorne of worldly pompe, carelesnesse, wants, and sometimes austerity of life, although naturally they are the merriest and most iouiall men in the world: their chiefe Abbots are called Archimandritans, but all in generall submit to the Episcopo of the Dioces, who wea∣reth coloured apparell of silke with a crosse ouer his hat, which is low crown'd, broad brimmed, and tied vnder his beard with long strings, hee carrieth a crosier in his hand, but it hath a plaine crosse; they call him also Protopapan the first Father of the congregation (from whence the By∣shoppe of <HI>Rome</HI> assumeth his <HI>Papa,</HI> or if you will the name of Pope) acknowledging the Patriarch of <HI>Constantinople</HI> at this very instant for supreame, and absolutely contesting against the Popes tyrannicall vsurpation: yea such is their hate to the Latins, I will not name their corruptions and Church, that they had rather liue in slauery and bondage

They obserue foure lents in a yeere, eat flesh on Saturdaies, but on Fridaies and all the lent, with other prohibited times, they neither eat flesh, fish, butter, cheese, or any meat, but like the Christians of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> are absti∣nent beyond reason, the ordinary desire of man, or any prescription of Scripture, or example of the Primatiue Church. They baptize with water and oyle, deny purga∣tory, neuer cut their haire, adore no pictures, nor images out of the Scriptures, and yet are superstitious in diuers fe∣stiuals, as S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Nicholay</HI> about sea matters, and <HI>Celestinus;</HI> S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>Demetrius,</HI> a feast about the 25. of October, called their drunken feast; and S<SUP>t</SUP>. <HI>George,</HI> who as our Ladies Knight hath obtained sufficient reputation. Their marria∣ges, dancings, festiuals and burials, haue the seuerall passa∣ges of many and strange ceremonies: but because whole volumes are written against their erroneous superstition, I referre you to such commentaries, concluding; that al∣though they are some way more tolerable then the Ro∣mish abuses, yet are their best garments so plighted with errours, and layd vp vnhandsomely with wrinckles, that when you come to vnfold them, you either exclaime a∣gainst the negligence of the seruant, or carelesnesse of the Master: who should be a better ouerseer.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XX.</HI> Certaine particulars concerning the Latin Church.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Here are so many bookes and disputations concerning the enormities of papisticall re∣ligion, that little children can in a manner <NOTE PLACE="marg">The corrup∣tions and a∣buses of the Romish Church.</NOTE> retort an argument, and cite you common places of Scripture, against their absurdi∣ties and idle traditions. I will therefore referre you to the larger dilations of matters of faith, and fundamentall points of saluation: and concerning the strength of their props, which now vphold their suprema∣cie and monarchall iurisdiction; in a few leaues of S<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Edwin Sands</HI> his worthy discourse, you shall see them tur∣ned vpside downe, as if an arme of <HI>Heccate</HI> were put into the throat to pull the entrailes outward, and shew you the strange diseases both of heart and lungs: or else examine the paraphrase of the Reuelation, and you shall heare di∣stinctly prooued the seat of Antechrist, the pride of the whore of <HI>Babylon,</HI> the persecution of the Saints, and the enormities of this <HI>Hosean</HI> strumpet, that hath broken the bands of her first wedlocke, and bedashed her selfe with lusts loathsome charriot. For mine owne part therefore, I will leaue that common way of inuection, or mustring vp the forces of argument out of the maine battell of Gods word, and breefly summe vp the accounts of her condemnation in this manner. 1. First, concerning their gouernment, it is meere politicall, as allowing all positi∣ons of tyranny, reuenge, disloyalty, licenciousnesse, wealth,
<PB N="290" REF="152"/>
and liberty, and wherein <HI>Euripides, Demosthenes, Isocrates, Tully, Salust, Perseus, Horace, Sigonius, Lipsius, Machiauell,</HI> or any other absolute or moderne writer opened a school∣house doore of diuellish deuices and distasting principles, to modest and orderly gouernments: they haue culled out the same to serue their owne turnes, and with the Iesuites, repute all others simple, that cannot labour in the worke of alteration of Kingdomes, and setting Princes at vari∣ance to corroborate their owne greatnesse. 2. Concer∣ning religion, it is meerely ridiculous, and a dart out of the quiuer of mans inuention; yea, so Diabolicall and Turkish, that it interdicteth the searching of Scriptures, disputing of matters of faith, or any opposition of their su∣perstitious decrees, councels, and consistorian statutes. 3. Concerning society and conuersation, it is meerely mundane, voluptuous, and sauouring nothing but de∣lightsome liberty: so that if there were not a God to bee prayed vnto and beleeued in, a heauen to bee expected, a saluation to be hoped after, and an account to bee made vpon a dreadfull summons indeed, I had rather be a Car∣dinall of <HI>Rome,</HI> then a Noble-man of <HI>Naples,</HI> who of all the Gentles in the world spred the largest cloth of vanities and voluptuousnesse. 4. And lastly, concerning their seeming vowes to obedience, chastity and pouerty; it is like <HI>Ianus</HI> face looking two wayes, and with the Lapwigg crying farthest from her nest: for they sauour not one word of truth in the same, as you shal see in the next chap∣ter. So that I will onely relate vnto you three seuerall sto∣ries of three seuerall sects, in which the absurdities of the Latin Church most plainely appeare.</P>
<P>In <HI>Rome</HI> amongst diuers others there liued a certaine <NOTE PLACE="marg">The story of a conuerted Iew.</NOTE> Iew, who had many controuersies with Christian Friers
<PB N="291" REF="152"/>
about both their religions, alledging for himselfe pre∣uailing arguments against their idolatry, or worshipping of images, wherein they would faine distinguish with the differences of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c. praying to Saints, pro∣phaning of the Saboth, incontinency of life, and burning candles in the day time, as it were in scorne of the glorious light of the sunne, all which though they were vnanswera∣ble, yet the Frier pleading the calling of the Gentiles, the destruction of the temple, the disanulling of Iewish cere∣monies, the birth and comming of Christ, as a prefixed time of another religion, the authority of the same, and the orders of the Church, preuailed so farre with the o∣ther, that he enclined a little to bee a Proselite, which the Frier reioyced to heare, triumphing exceedingly at the good successe of his oratory: nay soft (quoth the Iew) it is not thy perswasion hath coapted me to this course, but a certaine impression, that some great and good God is pro∣tectour of this place, or the prayers of an holy Patriarch (as <HI>Abraham</HI> disputed with <HI>Iehoua</HI> about the sauing of <HI>So∣dom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrha)</HI> are acceptable to heauen in the behalfe of some vnknowne good men; otherwise the sinnes of <HI>Rome</HI> are so many, the liues of Priests so corrupt, the wic∣kednesse of men so abominable, the villany of politicks so mischeeuous, and all things so discrepant to true religion and honesty, that I haue wondred a thousand times, how the whole countrey, especially the city, hath beene prote∣cted and supported from sinking to hell.</P>
<P>At another time, a sober <HI>Turke</HI> liuing in <HI>Rome,</HI> and wea∣ried with the riot of their Carneuall or Shroue-tide, at his <NOTE PLACE="marg">The story of a Turck con∣cerning his opinion of Rome.</NOTE> returne to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> being demanded his opinion of the Christians, answerered, that they had some tolerable customes, eat good meat, weare good clothes, or rather

spoyled much stuffe with fantasticke slashing and cutting it, and liued in good townes; but they were madd twice a yeere: For at one time they ranne like Diuels in a play vp and downe the streets with squibs of fire, making a noyse both on horse-backe, and on foot, keeping a coyle with Curtezans and Bawds, sporting with scurrulous and vn∣manly gambols, and performing actions of strange vnde∣cencies, which indeed is their time of Carneuall, a time of such sluttishnesse, vnrulinesse, and venerious riot in all the cities of <HI>Italy,</HI> that in <HI>Venice</HI> one <HI>Iceppo Marcello</HI> hath writ∣ten an inuectiue against it. Shortly after they went how∣ling in the streets like dogges, mourning with lamenta∣ble gestures, and whipping themselues vntill the bloud came, and this was on good Friday, when the Penetencia∣ries are couered ouer with a cassocke of canuasse, except two holes to looke out at, and all to belash themselues, vntill the blood runne downe their shoulders, whereby great Princes are so impostured, that contrary to a maine position of Scripture, against such voluntary humiliation and ridiculous inflictings, they haue entertained the pe∣nance, and vndertaken the stripes, witnesse <HI>Charles</HI> the 5. who left his rod of cords, as a iewell of his tresury to King <HI>Philip.</HI> Duke <HI>Ioieuse,</HI> called father <HI>Angelo;</HI> who returned to his orders, which was a bare-foot, or Mendicant Capu∣chin Frier, as soone as the league was dissolued, and many other both men and women of noble families, who enioy∣ned penance by their ghostly fathers, either by punishing their bodies, vnsauoury pilgrimages, fasts, abstinence, or such like endurances, are very zealous in the execution, and vpon confidence of some meritorious act, condiscend to dangerous and laborious miseries, yea, terrours abhor∣ring to nature. Now to my olde woman.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="153"/>
It is well knowne, that in the last dayes of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The story of the olde wo∣man at Strasborogh</NOTE> those dayes of firy triall, our roods and images in <HI>England</HI> were so palpably abused, and diuellishly stored with deui∣ces, that the Priests had diuers trickes to moue either eies, heads, or hands, yea to make them speake with variety of voyces, and palpable gesture, as if the Idols of <HI>Molech</HI> and <HI>Chemosh</HI> were to entertaine the presents of the people, and <HI>Bell</HI> had life indeede to deuoure the Kings allowance: which course is continued still in many places of <HI>Europe,</HI> insomuch that a while agoe in the Froe Church at <HI>Strasbo∣rogh,</HI> when certaine olde deuout women came to worship our Lady, the knauish Priests caused the childe to salute them in her armes, and (as it were) courteoufly to thanke them for making such account of his mother, which they not onely wondred at, but seemed in a manner offended, that the sonne should bee so bolde in the presence of our Lady: whereupon one more zealously angry then the rest, cryed out aloud; <HI>Peace I pray you young Gentle-man, I haue nothing to doe with you, let me heare what my good Ladie your mother sayes;</HI> and so when shee had no further reply, went away discontented.</P>
<P>Of this sort in our owne Kingdome of <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the beginning of his Maiesties raigne, when the townes were <NOTE PLACE="marg">Irish deuo∣tion.</NOTE> commanded to frequent the Churches, I was my selfe an eare-witnesse of many strange grudgings and murmurati∣ons, amongst which I yet encountred with this facete and indifferent deuotion; while two neighbours of <HI>Dublin</HI> were disputing about Church-matters, the one an indiffe∣rent Protestant, the other a superstitious Papist, and yet so seeming cunning, that she durst dispute between the Popes supremacy and the Kings authority, with a willing minde to satisfie either; her neighbour thus aduised, to goe to

And thus much concerning the Latine Church.

<P>If you begin with <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Normandy,</HI> his actions and warlike exploits are memorable, his trauels and la∣borious industry extraordinary, his wisdome in the seda∣tion of the tumults and factions amongst vs wonderfull,
<PB N="295" REF="154"/>
his magnanimitie in setling his Court and Palace admira∣ble, and his successe in all designes vnmatchable.</P>
<P>Howeuer <HI>William Rufus</HI> was so beholding to peace and prosperitie, that he tempred his warlike spirit from affe∣cting either forreine or domesticke dissention; yet did he consecrate many famous workes to the memory of his quietnes, and out of a swelling of princely greatnes, thought <HI>Westminster</HI> Hall (the wonder of the world for a roome in a house) too litle for so great a Maiestie.</P>
<P><HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Normandy</HI> went in person to <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and for his Heroicke successe and exploits might haue bin re∣warded with the Diadem, howeuer he was diuerted to re∣turne home againe into the fields of peace.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> the first was setled in the loue of his people, ta∣med the French, pacified <HI>Normandy,</HI> looked after <HI>Ireland,</HI> terrified his foes, corroborated his friends, loued learning, and was a <HI>Maecenas</HI> of all worthy conditions either in himselfe, or others; and howeuer the ielousie of soue∣raigne points intercepted the amitie of the brethren, yet was his worth many waies expatiated, and diuers parti∣culars of estimation extracted from his gouernment.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> the second obtained the dominion of <HI>Ireland,</HI> brought to happy period many conflicts in <HI>France,</HI> stop∣ped the breath of gaping hostilitie in <HI>England,</HI> lashed the sides of his vnruly children with stripes of discomfiture, and liued in great honor and estimation: insomuch, that he neuer exacted imposition of his people, nor wanted in his warres, yet left a treasure of aboue 200000 pound in ready coine, besides iewels, and plate, which was much in those daies.</P>
<P>What thinke you of <HI>Richard</HI> the first? Were not his voyages, conquests, titles, and surname of <HI>Cuer de Lyon</HI> for
<PB N="296" REF="155"/>
his valour, and exceeding courage, markes of true honor? Would not his life make a memorable story? Shall not his actions be registred in the court of eternitie? Did he not proue a worthy champion of renowme? <HI>Ciprus</HI> was wonne, <HI>Acon</HI> conquered, <HI>Ierusalem</HI> established, the confe∣derate Princes ielous of his glory, and all the countrey full of his memory: so that considering his tedious iour∣neyes, the perill of his person, the successe of his actions, and the noble end of his atchieuements, let the proudest of the <HI>Othoman</HI> race be compared and spare not.</P>
<P>The troubles of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> the Barons warres, the plantation and buildings in <HI>Ireland,</HI> the discouerie of the Clergies corruption, the calling in of <HI>Lewis,</HI> the dismissing the <HI>French</HI> backe againe, and the turbulency of those times may ranke themselues with the fame of very proud Mo∣narks.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> the third subdued the <HI>Welchmen,</HI> made sundry voiages into <HI>France,</HI> had many conflicts with his owne <HI>Barons,</HI> set forward a notable expedition to <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> shewed diuers effects of an heroicke and magnanimous spirit, raigned gloriously 56 yeeres, and in the <HI>interims</HI> of his peace brought many ostentous buildings to per∣fection.</P>
<P><HI>Edward</HI> the first went diuers times into <HI>Scotland,</HI> dispo∣sed of that Crowne, as he thought good, subiected them to <HI>England;</HI> conquered the <HI>Welchmen,</HI> appeased them with a Prince of his owne sonne borne in <HI>Carnaruan;</HI> setled his estate, and ended a famous life with a glorious death, to which when renowne and victorie was added, the applause rang through the world.</P>
<P><HI>Edward</HI> the third, and the blacke Prince haue engrossed the fame and renowne of the vniuersall earth, and many
<PB N="297" REF="155"/>
memorable actions are aduanced vp as trophees of their vnimitable glory; so that they may march to the palace of maiestie with the proudest Emperors. For what wor∣thy atchieuements so euer haue bin perpetuated in <HI>Eng∣land, Wales, Scotland, Almaigne,</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> in their owne persons they haue brought to passe, as if they had bin borne to shew some wonder of nature, and exposed as rare examples to succeeding times. And for his other sonnes, step into the proudest house of <HI>Austria,</HI> and tell me who can match them? <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Gaunt</HI> went twise into <HI>Spaine,</HI> and conquered <HI>Castile</HI> in the right of his wife. <HI>Lionell</HI> Duke of <HI>Clarence</HI> passed the Alpes into <HI>Italy,</HI> ma∣ried the daughter of <HI>Millane,</HI> reuelled in those parts with extraordinary cost, pompe, and attendants, and wrought both a reuerence and loue toward his person from for∣reine people. <HI>Edmond</HI> of <HI>Langley</HI> Duke of <HI>Yorke</HI> was so wise and reposed, that the gouernment of <HI>England</HI> kept it selfe warme vnder the ouer-spreading of his embraces. <HI>Thomas</HI> of <HI>Woodstocke</HI> Duke of <HI>Glocester</HI> was so true a lo∣uer of his country, and champion of honor, that he con∣tested with Maiestie for degenerating from her owne pro∣perties, and durst tell his nephew King, wherein he wan∣dred from his paternall renowne.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, when he was but Earle of <HI>Hertford,</HI> went into <HI>Africke,</HI> bare his father company into <HI>Spaine,</HI> and obtained the diadem through popular loue, and re∣spect of the people.</P>
<P>And although King <HI>Richard</HI> the second, was an vnfor∣tunate Prince, yet did he surpasse both auncestors and successors for brauery in apparell, costly expences, sum∣ptuous fare, glorious courtship, noble company, princely reuels, and magnificent estimation: For all the while
<PB N="298" REF="156"/>
Queene <HI>Anne</HI> of <HI>Bohemia</HI> liued, the fame of <HI>England</HI> was dispersed ouer the world, and the King had 8 or 10000 continually in his Court, whereby his pompe and port surpassed other Princes.</P>
<P>But would you wonder indeed? Then looke into the 9 yeeres of <HI>Henry</HI> the fift, and you shall see such a vnitie of vertues, consent of graces, entertainment of valour, perfection of industry, militarie brauery, and fulnes of ge∣nerous designes, that his very enemies gaue way to the report of his worthy life; and <HI>France</HI> in his death was left as a comfortles widow, or desolate orphan.</P>
<P>I might recite the fame of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, for reuen∣ging his fathers death, many conflicts before and after he was King, his voiages into <HI>France,</HI> his distastings against <HI>Burgundy,</HI> his troubles at home, and other princely dis∣positions.</P>
<P>I could also bring into your good opinion the valour of <HI>Henry</HI> the seuenth, his miraculous deliuery, his noble establishment, his buildings and sumptuous monuments, his riches and wealth, his wisdome and politicke contri∣uing of affaires, the stately disposing of his Palace, and many other remarkable actions, but I am affraid, that I am too weakly furnished to enter into the lists with iudi∣cious censurers, nor shall be able to wrastle with opinion and seuere examination, which will rather condemne me for slight extenuation in the attempt, than entertaine the discourse, as a befitting subiect, or adapted explication of princelines.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> the eight wan <HI>Turwin</HI> and <HI>Turnay,</HI> entertained the Emperor <HI>Maximilian,</HI> welcommed <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, compounded at his pleasure with <HI>France,</HI> made voiage after voiage, conquered <HI>Bulloigne,</HI> had almost obtained the

If you search the wounds of the <HI>Persian</HI> and <HI>Turkish</HI> gouernment, as they seeme now to be healed, you shall finde them badly cured, and in∣deed festred so dangerously, that they must bee better ouer-viewed, or their inward putrefaction will on a sud∣den poyson the very entrailes: For they haue bin tossed and tumbled with many alterations, and euer since <HI>Tam∣berlaine</HI> descended out of <HI>Scithia</HI> amongst them, suffred diuers concussions both in gouernment and religions, so that howeuer the <HI>Persian</HI> is more noble, yet he hath per∣mitted a mixture of many barbarous people to the great disturbance of his former glory: As for the <HI>Turke</HI> hee is meerely new to vs, and a formidable intruder into such territories, as he gripeth with a strong arme; so that what you now behold amongst these <HI>Mahumetans</HI> is onely vp∣held by tyrannie, a band of no greater strength, then power, forces, and reward can tye together, wherein if any faile the gouernment is quickly let loose, and the sub∣iect at liberty taketh hold of euery innovation: and al∣though by tumbling and tossing like to heaps of snow rowled vp and downe, they haue growne greater and greater, while the frosty coldnes of our Christian Princes gaue them leaue to harden, whereby they are increased to that stupendous heape you now see: yet when a thaw comes, and that <HI>rota fortunae</HI> is in <HI>Gyro,</HI> it shall and will be subiect to diminution, especially when the glorious sunne of successe shineth out the consent of our Kings to expulse them at least out of <HI>Europe,</HI> if not from the vsurpation of the better parts of <HI>Asia.</HI></P>
<P>The Kingdome of <HI>Hungary,</HI> though but lately establi∣shed, and knowne by a different royalty from the <HI>Empires</HI> either of <HI>Greece,</HI> or <HI>Germany;</HI> yet as you see a prey seased

on by a hawke, or other tormenting vulture, pull'd in peeces, and cruelly rent a sunder: hath suffered many di∣lacerations, and besides the capitall enemy of Christen∣dome her proppes sawed a sunder by some barbarous hands amongst themselues. The Kingdome of <HI>Poland</HI> is not 300. yeere old: For it retained in times past, but the prerogatiue of a Dukes coronet, and was euer in conten∣tion with <HI>Lithuania</HI> and the adioyning Princes, vntill the Pope vndertooke the appeasing of those troubles, and ad∣ded the grace of a roiall inuesture to <HI>Sigismundus,</HI> surna∣med the great, who at last vnited both <HI>Pomerania, Prussia,</HI> and <HI>Lithuania;</HI> yet is not so established, but the Election of the Peeres diminisheth the prerogatiue of the King, and new Princes; new lawes, new confederacy, new go∣uernment, haue let confusion, and alteration loose vpon the Countrey.</P>
<P>The Emperour, Princes, Electors, and principalities in <HI>Germany</HI> are almost of the same nature and condition, but that many liberties of Cities haue beene bought out with mony and diuers franchises purchased to redeeme themselues from the tyrannie of wanton lords: so that in particular many families haue beene chopped and changed, honourable houses transmuted, and new names and titles haue as it were thrust the old out of doores: and in generall, what with the French, Germanes, and the house of Austria, there hath not a thought passed for here∣ditary succession, but all things haue beene subiect to in∣stabilitie, and are still hurried in the current of preuailing, as either the Pope, <HI>Electorum placitus,</HI> or <HI>militareius</HI> filling the sailes full of winde, giueth them leaue to driue the barke of the gouernment forward.

In which prerogatiues I dare be bold to say, that ENGLAND excells all other nations, as the light of the Sunne inferiour Planets: For in some places they are abso∣lute slaues: in some places denied the comfort of their owne endeauours: in some places not capable of purcha∣ses: in some places not permitted to marry aboue their de∣gree, and elsewhere not suffered to enioy the freedome of life, or benefit of nature: as for an instance.

In <HI>Italy</HI> they are a little better, as long as they be able to pay their rents, and husband their grounds; yet doe they seldome liue of their owne, or execute any thing befitting the freedome of conuersation: Besides in many places they are so terrified with the troublesome incursi∣ons of the Banditi, who euen make a prey of their wealth and cattle, that although they know of their robberies and murthers, yet dare they neither detect them, nor deny to entertaine or releeue them.

But how wee haue preuailed indeed, let these few instances suffice.</P>
<P>About the 14 of <HI>Edw:</HI> 3. the King gathered a Nauy of 200 saile against the <HI>French,</HI> who in those daies were co∣adiuted with <HI>Flanders,</HI> as a Peere of <HI>France,</HI> wherein though he was mightily ouer-matched with numbers, yet preuailed he in execution, and had so triumphant a victo∣rie, that their owne account numbred 30000 men slaine, 200 ships surprized, and taken, and the rest put to an ig∣nominious flight. The 20 yeere hee went into <HI>Nor∣mandy,</HI> dismantled her Townes, spoiled <HI>Cane,</HI> and as a messenger of reuenge brought fire into the Harbours vn∣till the ships were consumed and set on a blase. <HI>Anno</HI> 24 he encountred the power of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and vnplumed their fethers of ostentation by taking 28 great ships, and ma∣king the rest vnseruiceable. <HI>Anno</HI> 33 he sailed into <HI>Pi∣cardy,</HI> and so preuailed, that the sea yeelded him safe pas∣sage, and all <HI>Burgundy</HI> safe conduct. <HI>Anno</HI> 41 with a memorable victory both at sea and land did the blacke <HI>Prince</HI> resettle <HI>Peter</HI> of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and in despight of all the
<PB N="311" REF="162"/>
sea forces, or other warlike opposition passed and repassed at pleasure. In the time of <HI>Rich:</HI> 2. about the 10 yeere the Duke of <HI>Lancaster</HI> sailed into <HI>Spaine,</HI> but how glorious that victory was on our side, and how surmounting our Nauie before theirs, the wonderfull successe attested, and their owne inventories record the losse with lamentable <HI>Items.</HI> The next yeere following <HI>Richard Earle</HI> of <HI>Arun∣dell,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Earle</HI> of <HI>Notingham</HI> encountred at sea with an infinite number of <HI>Flemmings;</HI> but victory is in the hands of God, and multitudes of men faile in their ostentation: For in that maritime contention were taken a 100 ships and better, the successe filling our Cities with commodities, and our mouthes with praises and thanksgiuing. In the 5 of <HI>Henr:</HI> 4 when the <HI>French</HI> came to the Ile of <HI>Wight,</HI> and assailed <HI>Dartmouth</HI> with a great Nauy, the rusticall people preuailed against them, and manning out but the fisher-boats of the country, with certaine Pinaces attending the seruice, tooke 16 of their best ships, and compulsed the rest to be the messen∣gers of their owne obloquy. The 3. of <HI>Hen:</HI> 5. was a yeere of triumph, and a 1000 saile of ships filled the narrow seas, cleared the passage into <HI>Normandy,</HI> amased all men, who had notice of our brauery, and reioyced the rest of <HI>Europe</HI> with <HI>Encomians</HI> of our successe, which followed presently in <HI>France.</HI> In the 15 of <HI>Edw:</HI> 4. it pleased the King to passe ouer to the aide of the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> but howeuer his inconstancie proued vnsauory to vs at land, it matters not: I am sure the seas gaue vs way, nor durst their Nauy presume to intercept vs. In the 5. of <HI>Hen:</HI> 8. the former encounter, which I named at <HI>Britaines bay</HI> was a day of terror, and we tooke, burnt, and spoiled as many, as we mustred out of harbour. The
<PB N="312" REF="163"/>
next yeere threatning <HI>Turwin</HI> and <HI>Turnay</HI> our Nauy ca∣rying all afore it like a swelling riuer, beating downe the slender banks, there scarce appeared an opposite: for the former losses were so great, that they halted downe-right in their recouery, and <HI>France</HI> once lamed in her shipping, cannot euery yeere bring a new Nauy into the channell with good equipage, or aduantage. The 14 yeere the <HI>Earle</HI> of <HI>Surrey</HI> was <HI>Admirall,</HI> and not onely preuailed in all encounters at sea, but by vertue of our shipping con∣quered diuers townes both in <HI>Britaine</HI> and <HI>Picardy.</HI> The 15. the Duke of <HI>Suffolke</HI> was sent into <HI>France</HI> with an army of 30000, who passed the seas, yea the water of <HI>Some</HI> without battaile, and so terrified the French with all their coadiutors at that time (for you must vnderstand in those repining and murmuring daies against our glory, <HI>France, Spaine,</HI> the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> were ei∣ther confederate, or entertained for wages: so that almost all the mercenary shipping of <HI>Europe</HI> attended on the payment of the crownes of the sunne) that they thought it the best part of their securitie to absent themselues. The yeere 35. <HI>Sir Iohn Dudley Vicount Lisle</HI> high <HI>Admirall</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> with a Nauy of 200 saile, passed the seas into <HI>Scotland,</HI> in despight of all the power the confederates could raise, and not onely performed actions beyond ex∣pectation, but taught them the true knowledge of English shipping and mariners. The next yeere the French Na∣uy came into <HI>Sussex;</HI> but vpon very short warning were dissipated, and in a sudden encounter felt the smart of presumption. Presently as in diuers aduantages of such petty roades and excursions; they landed at <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> and the <HI>Ile</HI> of <HI>Wight,</HI> but with what successe or satisfa∣ction, I cannot compare it better than to a bowle of wa∣ter

spilt, irrecouerably to be gathered vp againe: For they neuer durst aduenture, when our ships looked bigg vpon them, but vnderstanding of their imployment abroad, and sequestration farre off, then hurried they suddenly vpon vs; yet I hope neither found vs vnprouided, nor returned backe againe with true cause of insulting. In the 3. of <HI>Edw:</HI> 6. the French Kings gallies and Caricks invaded <HI>Gernsey</HI> and <HI>Iersey:</HI> but with what face fortune looked vpon them, the losse of a 1000 men, with the spoile of their greatest ships and gallies suddenly discouered. Why may I not name here our iourney to <HI>Newhauen</HI> in the 4. of <HI>Queene Elizabeth,</HI> when through the power of our Nauy, at which both <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> began to repine, the Earle of Warwicke made the seas wanton with iollity, and affrighted the land with those small troopes of old souldiers from the Garison at <HI>Barwick,</HI> vnited to others raised from the willing musters of our country: and al∣though some enuious hand would stop the mouth of re∣port from ecchoing our applause at this time, yet I am sure <HI>Count Ringraue</HI> and his armie felt the smart of affliction, and the sorrow of many defeatures, and dare auouch, that the seas lay open vnto vs in despight of opposition, or any encounter our enemies durst or could prepare to invite vs to. In the 18. yeere was <HI>Forbishers</HI> first voyage, and by reason that this glorious Queene had as it were tied the obseruation of all Nations to her actions and gouern∣ment, a peace being generally contracted, diuers presum∣ptuous persons tooke aduantage of the same, and filled the narrow seas with rouers and pirats, who ranne vp and downe without controll, like vntamed colts, scorning all enclosures and bounds', vntill <HI>Captaine Holstock</HI> with 4. good ships and two pinaces was appointed the reformer

About the 23. that famous busines of <HI>Desmonds</HI> rebellion breathed insolencie into those people, by reason the Pope and Spaniard had fortified themselues in <HI>Smir∣wick</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and with a sufficient number of ships blocked vp the hauen, vntill certaine of her Maiesties Na∣uie, and the Deputies forces at land (being then the for∣ward <HI>Lord Grey)</HI> behaued themselues with such good or∣der and successe, that all the passages of victory to vs, and miserable discomfiture to them were set open, and we tri∣umphed with a plenary satisfaction to our endeuours. In the 24. <HI>Monsieur</HI> returned into the Low-countries to bee invested with the Duchy of <HI>Brabant:</HI> but when he beheld our glorious fleete, and iudiciously looked vpon their strength and brauery, he burst out into a passionate ap∣plause, and sware, that howeuer men were enemies to our peace, they were enemies to truth, if they did not acknow∣ledge it without comparison. The yeere following <HI>Cap∣taine Borough</HI> with one ship, and a small Barke went to sea against Rouers, and although the Councell at that time suspected vs ouer-weake to withstand an vnited despe∣ratenes; yet the fight continued against 7 or 8, and all men can witnes our memorable successe in that encoun∣ter. The triumphs of 88 are of such renowne, and wor∣thy celebration, that the world still remembers our illu∣strious

Nor doe I heare reckon vp our Merchant Aduenturers, and the sundry times encountring with greater and more aduantagious forces: witnes the Mar∣chant Royall in those times, when <HI>Iohn King</HI> was Master, which alone encountred with 3 ships, and 10 gallies, and came off with such iollity, as they fretted to be so disap∣pointed, and we triumphed to welcome home so well de∣seruing a man. Since when, although those of <HI>Malta, Florence,</HI> the confederates of the Arches, and many de∣sperate Pirats, haue conspired against our traphique, and made our iourney into the <HI>Leuant</HI> somewhat dangerous: yet we haue still gone forward, and could not bee pull'd backe by any wrenching arme whatsoeuer: especially in those daies of tryall, when we stood on our guard, and made our warlike preparation a very paire of tarriers to the Spaniard. For in those daies the <HI>Conuoy</HI> for his we∣sterne treasure was so toilesome, troublesome, chargeable, and dangerous vnto him, that one million defraied but the charges of another, and by that time it came to distribu∣tion, there was a strange account cast vp of losses, and de∣fatigable expences.

For so I must tell you, that except you aduise with your selfe for this denomination in many places of the world the excuse of curiositie will not serue your turne: For you shall be taken for a Spie, and a dangerous Hypocrite, such is the iealousie of Kingdomes toward wanton Tra∣uellers, and the necessitie of entertainment for well im∣ploied men. And thus much for some speciall excellen∣cies wherein England excelleth all other Nations.</P>

Nation of <HI>Europe:</HI> not that I meane to trouble you with vaine or tedious repetitions of Embassadors, Legats, Car∣dinalls, or other ordinary Liegers, as is customarie in all Princes Courts, and concurses of State; but meerely of extraordinary solemnities, and occasion of resplendant showes, triumphs, and festiuall inuitations to delight and contentment.</P>
<P>No sooner had the <HI>Normane</HI> setled his Conquests, and established his sonne <HI>William Rufus</HI> in the throne of great∣nesse, as well appeared by his ambitious desires to fill all <HI>Europe</HI> with the report of his exaltation; especially after his returne out of <HI>Normandy,</HI> and that he found fault with the smalnesse of <HI>Westminster-hall,</HI> being yet the remarke∣ablest roome for State, greatnesse, and capacity in the world. But <HI>Malcolme</HI> King of <HI>Scots,</HI> and the two Princes of <HI>Wales</HI> came to doe homage vnto him about the third yeere of his raigne; yea <HI>Robert</HI> Duke of <HI>Normandy</HI> with many Princes of <HI>France</HI> acknowledged his eminent glory, and maiesticall Kingdome; although the said <HI>Robert</HI> was his elder Brother, and made way to his peace and amitie. This likewise continued toward <HI>Henry</HI> the first, and for addition, the Kings his adioyned neighbours assumed no∣thing to themselues, but what stood with the good liking of the King of ENGLAND, for which purpose they ma∣ny times came in person to gratifie him: To which if you vnite the aduantagious marriage of <HI>Henry</HI> Emperour of <HI>Rome</HI> to his daughter, I hope it may passe for a reasonable beginning, and giue life to after hopes for the augmentati∣on of our credits, and exaltation of our prerogatiues.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1184. about the 31. of <HI>Henry</HI> 2. <HI>Heraclius</HI> Pa∣triarch of <HI>Hierusalem</HI> came into our Countrey to desire aide against the Turke. 1201. and the 3. of King <HI>Iohn</HI>
<PB N="322" REF="167"/>
at a solemne entertainement in <HI>Lincolne, William</HI> King of Scots and diuers of his Nobles did homage vnto him in person, to which if you adde his marrying of Lady IANE his bastard daughter to <HI>Leuelin</HI> Prince of Wales, who was in those times a turbulent and ambitious man, you may easily iudge, what reputation our Countrey had got in the world, when the Pope was more affrighted at the starting aside of little ENGLAND, then if whole <HI>Spaine</HI> had at that time falne quite away, from his suppor∣tation, or if you will Antichristian vsurpation.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1224. about the 8. yeere of the raigne of <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> 3. <HI>Iohn de Brennes</HI> King of <HI>Hierusalem</HI> came into <HI>Eng∣land</HI> for aide and assistance against the Saracens, and from that vnimitable example of <HI>Richard</HI> 1. called in those times the flower of chiualry, that wunne <HI>Cyprus</HI> and <HI>Acon</HI> in person, well hoped to finde the other branches of that kingly off-spring full of the sappe of the same roialtie; but when I remember, how the chiefest Potentates of <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> came to elect <HI>Richard</HI> Earle of <HI>Cornwall</HI> his brother Emperour, and King of the Romans, I am more then sa∣tisfied for maintaining this vnanswerable position of our excellency in this kinde.</P>
<P>If you ouerlooke the life of <HI>Edward</HI> 1. you shall finde it a very mappe of honour, and be able to tell the world, that besides many forraine Potentates, the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> and his brother <HI>Dauid</HI> reioiced in his acceptation of them; and <HI>Iohn Baliol</HI> King of Scots was glad to be named and established by him: But come a little forward, and at the naming of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3. me thinkes all English hearts should leape for ioy.

him to the chaire of the Empire: nay such was our roy∣altie that <HI>Henry Pichard</HI> Vintner and Maior of <HI>London</HI> feasted EDW. of England; IOHN King of France; the King of <HI>Cyprus</HI> comming to see our worthinesse; DAVID King of Scots; EDW. Prince of Wales, Duke of Aqui∣tane, Guien, and Cornwall, all in one day: Besides at di∣uers triumphes and Iusts these forraine Princes were led as it were by the hand of amasement to magnifie, and extoll the heroicke spirits of our nation. Againe in the 38. yeere of the King; the French King, the King of Cyprus, and the King of Scots, came all into England, and made pleasure proude, that it had good occasion to welcome them. Besides, 1367. <HI>Peter</HI> King of Spaine was disseised by his bastard brother <HI>Henry,</HI> but comming into England made such impression in the compassionate soule of EDW. the blacke Prince, that he assisted him in person, and re∣established him in his kingdome.</P>
<P>Shall I remember you of that glorious celebration of <HI>Himmeneus</HI> triumphs, when Duke <HI>Tussus</HI> and many Prin∣ces of <HI>Boheme</HI> and <HI>Hungary</HI> brought that magnificent La∣dy ANNE daughter to the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and married her to King RICHARD the 2. of England, during whose life such was the royaltie of our Court and State, that in the 8. yeare the King of <HI>Armenia</HI> came into England for coadiutement against the Turkes. In the 12. yeare the Earle of Saint <HI>Paul</HI> and many Princes out of France and other Countries came to a Iusts in Smithfield, and made a iust estimation of our vnualuable glory. In the 16. yeare the greatest Lords of Scotland came to our triumphes in England, and checked their owne presumption for con∣fronting vs with a supposition of equality. In the 20. yeare the Dukes of <HI>Burbon</HI> and <HI>Barre</HI> brought ouer <HI>Isabell</HI>

<P>In the 4. yeare of HENRY 4. King of England the Emperour of Constantinople came of purpose as the Queene of <HI>Sheba</HI> to <HI>Salomon,</HI> to set report on the touch∣stone of truth, and see whether custome had enlarged our fame or no, and here he was entertained with all the sump∣tuous and attractiue showes, and delights, that Arte and expences could deuise to satiate the minde of man: But when Dame IANE Dutches of <HI>Britaine</HI> came ouer to marry our King HENRY, I hope our enemies will ima∣gine, her traine and Attendants to bee much augmented with the company of many forraine Princes and Poten∣tates: And if you steppe forward to the 8. yeare of his raigne the Earle of <HI>Marre,</HI> and the great lords of <HI>Scotland</HI> came to solace themselues, and made their triumphes both at Tilt and Turney acceptable to the beholders. The like was performed the 10. yeare, when the <HI>Seneschall</HI> of <HI>Hen∣nault</HI> with all those Princes reputed the Court of England a very Schoole of chiualry, and put in practise according∣ly all the braueries of marshall discipline. But when the Lady LVCIA the Dukes sister of <HI>Millane</HI> came to marry EDMVND Earle of <HI>Kent,</HI> both citie and pallace was so furnished with strangers, and the concurses of people so well ordered, that inferiours were amased at so extraordi∣nary attraction, and the better sort gaue a plaudite to our glory.</P>

If you ouer-looke the time of <HI>Henr:</HI> 5. surnamed the <HI>Champion</HI> of <HI>Honor,</HI> though it was lamentable for the breuitie, yet was it vnmatchable for the royalty. For after his coronation he was scarse three yeeres in his own Kingdome, and yet in the third of his raigne he welcom∣med the <HI>Emperor</HI> of <HI>Almaine</HI> and King of <HI>Rome,</HI> and pre∣sently after graced the daughter of <HI>France</HI> and all her re∣tinue, with many forreine Princes, who would not re∣turne, till they saw their <HI>Lady Katherine</HI> Queene of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> To which if you adde the entertainment of the Duke of <HI>Holland,</HI> and many Princes of those countries, especially <HI>Freesland,</HI> you cannot chuse but make vp a plentifull breuiary of Heroicke Maiesty, and worthy princelines.</P>
<P>About the yeere of Grace 1502. and the 17. yeere of the raigne of <HI>Henry</HI> 7. the expectable <HI>Prince Arthur</HI> ma∣ried <HI>Katherin</HI> daughter to <HI>Ferdinando</HI> King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and his eldest sister <HI>Margaret</HI> was affianced vnto <HI>Iames</HI> King of <HI>Scots,</HI> at whose inaugu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>tion the concurse of strangers, and amongst them of the choisest Princes was so great, that all other adioyning Kings as much magnified our royalty, as feared our power, insomuch that the very re∣port of our Kingdomes brauery draue <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>Castile,</HI> and his wife into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>About the end of <HI>August</HI> 1546. <HI>Flawd</HI> high Admirall of <HI>France</HI> was so royally entertained in <HI>England,</HI> that the King lying at <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> met him comming to haue audience with a 1000 horse, whereof 500 were in one liuery, the coates of veluet halfe embro∣dered with gold, and one sleeue of cloth of gold: let other Princes acknowledge this magnificence. <HI>Holinshed</HI> saith 2000 horse.</P>

<P>Shall I name you King <HI>Philips</HI> mariage with Queene <HI>Mary?</HI> I hope then I must trouble you with a tedious so∣lemnitie, and tell you, that many strangers knew not the way home againe into their owne countries a long time; and if the peace of their soules as they vainely imagined, might haue bin added to the delight of their bodies, the happines of <HI>England</HI> had bin the subiect of their tongues, and the obiect of their eyes. In the second yeere of her raigne <HI>Ecmondine</HI> a Prince of <HI>Germany,</HI> and other Embas∣sadors were sent from the Emperor. In the third yeere <HI>Emmanuel</HI> Prince of <HI>Piemont,</HI> with other Lords came into <HI>England,</HI> and the next moneth the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> landed at <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>But let mee passe forward to the mirror of all times <HI>Queene Elizabeth:</HI> how proud was the Prince of <HI>Sweden,</HI> that he was graced in <HI>England</HI> with so glorious entertain∣ment at the beginning of her raigne. Not long after 1565 <HI>Christopher</HI> Prince and Marquesse of <HI>Baden</HI> came of purpose to haue his childe borne amongst vs, and re∣ioyce in the fortune of such a godmother. About the 11. yeere of her raigne <HI>anno</HI> 1568 <HI>Mary Queene</HI> of <HI>Scots,</HI> though shee was surprized in her flight to <HI>France,</HI> and de∣feated

in her maine proiects; yet for a long time misliked not her imprisonment, and was glad to confesse the pre∣rogatiues of her natiue soile and country. In the 14. yeere <HI>Francis</HI> Duke of <HI>Memorancy,</HI> and <HI>Betrawde de Sa∣ligniers</HI> Knights of the order of S<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Michael,</HI> came both into <HI>England,</HI> with other great Princes to gratulate her Maiestie, and acknowledge her worthines. In the 21. of her raigne 1578. <HI>Cassimirus</HI> Count Palatine, and Duke of <HI>Bauaria</HI> was entertained the better, because he came of purpose to admire her Maiestie, and commend her coun∣try. Not long after 1581. <HI>Francis Burbon Prince Daul∣phine</HI> of <HI>Auergne, Arthur Cass Marshall</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> with <HI>Lusignian</HI> and others came to make way to <HI>Monsieurs</HI> ad∣mission, who accordingly <HI>anno</HI> 24, as Duke of <HI>Aniou,</HI> the French Kings brother, and next heire to the <HI>flower-de-luce,</HI> was welcommed beyond expectation, and entertained with such sumptuous showes, and variety of delight, that they know not, how to put it ouer with true noblenes, considering the disparity betweene their customes and ours. About the yeere 1583. <HI>Albertus Alasco</HI> free Ba∣ron of <HI>Lasco Vaiuode,</HI> or <HI>Palatine</HI> of <HI>Siradia</HI> in <HI>Poland,</HI> was an eye witnes of our many prerogatiues, such as we may terme Court brauery, Cities excellency, countries happines, vniformitie of our Vniuersities, strength of our Nauies, and glorious contentation in all estates.</P>

Prince and subiect.

For in truth within the walls and iron gates it containeth as much roome or more, than all <HI>S. Iames</HI> parke, and <HI>Whitehall</HI> together.</P>
<P>When our <HI>King Iames</HI> was established to the admiration of all the states of <HI>Europe; Monsieur Rosne</HI> from <HI>France; Don Iohn de Tassis</HI> from <HI>Spaine;</HI> and many other extra∣ordinary Princes from all the Courts of Christendome, came ouer to gratifie his happines: but 1604 <HI>Don Iohn de Velasco, Constable</HI> of <HI>Castile</HI> was as an extraordinary Prince extraordinarily entertained: to which if you vnite the glorious welcome and admission of <HI>Prince Vlrick Duke</HI> of <HI>Holstaide:</HI> as also of <HI>George Lodwick Lantgraue</HI> of <HI>Lu∣tenburgh</HI> sent from the <HI>Emperor Rodulph,</HI> you may well expose their entertainment against the greatest magnifi∣cence of other countries. <HI>Anno</HI> 1606 <HI>Don Iohn de Mendoza Marquisse</HI> of <HI>S.

you looke on Kings Colledge chappell, the sumptuous quadrant of Trinitie, and the delicate compacting of our new Colledges, you cannot but imagine, we had a hope in the structures to contriue some thing for admiration. If in <HI>Oxford</HI> you consider the Diuinitie schooles, the foundations of <HI>Christs Church, Sir Thomas Bodleis</HI> library, and other things of account, you must needs conclude, that we striued to exalt our Nation for such rarities. Our bathes, high waies, and securitie to trauell in are not to be ouer passed. Our <HI>Inns,</HI> or as they call them <HI>Hosteries,</HI> with other places of entertainment, yeeld a plenary satis∣faction to our trauels, and open the embracings of extra∣ordinary welcome, insomuch that our wearied bodies are folded in the armes of quietnes and rest, and our troubled spirits setled in reposednes and content.
