<HEAD>GREAT NEWS FROM THE Polish Camp, and the Terms upon which his <HI>Most Christian Majesty</HI> proffers to make a Peace with the Republique of GENOA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>From the <HI>Polish Camp</HI> at <HI>Soochin,</HI> <DATE>the 2d. of <HI>October.</HI> 1684.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THe Rain hath continued here, for four Weeks toge∣ther, which hath so swelled the <HI>Neister,</HI> that notwith∣standing all Endeavours, it hath ruined our Bridge, so that only a part of our Army got over.</P>
<P>The Rains have so far incommoded us, that we as well as our Horses stand in Mud, and want forrage.</P>
<P>We also, are not freed from an Invasion of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> for they in a great Body having already past the River, and laid the Country in ruin.</P>
<P>His Majesty is much displeased, being prevented in his de∣signs if he had got over the River: But he resolves to put a good Garrison in <HI>Suaint</HI> and <HI>Soochin,</HI> and then to march for <HI>Camminack,</HI> with hopes, that though he cannot besiege that place, that yet he shall find an opportunity in <HI>Moldavia</HI> to get over the River.</P>
<P>'Tis said these <HI>Tartars</HI> are 60000 strong, under Command of the <HI>Cham</HI> and his Son.</P>

<PB N="2" REF="2"/>
<HEAD>Conditions, on which his Most Christian Majesty proffers to give a Peacet <HI>Genoa,</HI> are as followeth, <HI>Viz.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THat the Duke and four <HI>Senators</HI> shall come in per∣son and submit to his Majesty.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the <HI>Genovees</HI> shall observe an equal Newtrallity, and not Engage in the affairs of other Princes.</P>
<P N="3">3. That they shall dis-arm all their Gallies but six, and shall Arm no more without the consent of his Most Christian Majesty.</P>
<P N="4">4 That they shall give free passage, and being to the <HI>Salt</HI> in <HI>Savonia,</HI> that so it may pass freely to <HI>Monferrat.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. That all the French Kings Subjects, that are forced from their Goods and Estates, shall be restored, and re∣imbursed; and that Justice shall be Administred to the French Subjects, that have any pretences on those of <HI>Genoa.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. That Restitution shall be made of those Goods taken out of the House of <HI>Fresque,</HI> and that 100000. Crowns shall be paid in part to the Earl of <HI>Fresque:</HI> But if they have any pretence, to any of the Goods be∣longing to that House, they shall be heard, and his Ma∣jesty will do them Justice.</P>
<P N="7">7. In Case of Refusal, they must expect no peace or quiet with <HI>France,</HI> and that this was the last Resolution of that King.</P>
<P>To all which the <HI>Genoa</HI> Resident (and Prisoner in the <HI>Bastile</HI> in <HI>Paris</HI>) answered as followeth,</P>
<P>If the King will see the Duke and <HI>Senators,</HI> he must go and see them at <HI>Genoa,</HI> or fetch them <HI>per</HI> force, and that he could give no other answer.</P>
