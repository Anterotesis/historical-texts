They are made ac∣cording to the sholdnes of the riuer, because that the riuer is in many places ful of great stones, which doth greatly hinder and trouble those that go down the riuer.

My iudgment and reason of this is, that because the Tower is set in a very great plaine, and hath nothinge more about to make any show sauing the ruines of it which it hath made round about, and for this respect that discrying it a far off, that peece of the Tower which yet standeth with the mountaine that is made of the substance that hath fallen from it, maketh a greater shew then you shall finde com∣ming neere to it.</P>

In <HI>Pegu</HI> this search they<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iewells paye custome.</NOTE> make when they go out of the ship for Diamonds, Pearles, and fine cloth which taketh little rome: for because that all the Jewels that come into <HI>Pegu,</HI> and are not founde of that countrie: pay custome, but Rubies, Safyres, and Spynelles, pay no custome in: nor out, because they are founde growing<NOTE PLACE="marg">In those Cen¦tries there is another inner lodging, but euery man that trauelleth must hier his house, and bring his ne¦cessaries with him.</NOTE> in that countrie.

and in eight dayes you may make your voyage vp to <HI>Mac∣ceo,</HI> distant from <HI>Pegu</HI> twelue myles, and there they dis∣charge<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deling is a small litter caried with men as is aforesaide.</NOTE> their goodes, and lade it in Carts or Waynes drawn with Oxen, and the merchauntes is caried in a closet which they call Delinge, in the which a man shall bee verie well accommodated, with Cushions vnder his head, and co∣uered for the defence of the Sunne and raine, and there hée may sleepe if he haue wil therunto: and his fowre Falchiues carie him roming away, changing two at one time and two at another.

if the merchants will sell their goodes at that price: they sell it away, and the Brokers haue two in y<SUP>•</SUP> hundreth of euerie sort of Merchandise, and they are bounde to make good the debtes of that goodes, because it is solde by their handes or meanes, and on their wordes, and oftentimes the mer∣chant<NOTE PLACE="marg">The brokers are lowed to make good al the debts to the merchant.</NOTE> knoweth not to whome he giueth his goodes, yet hee cannot lose any thing thereby, for that the broker is bounde in any wise to pay him, and if the merchant sell his goodes without the consent of the broker: yet neuerthelesse he must pay him two <HI>percento,</HI> and be in daunger of his mony, but this is verie seldome seene, because the Wife, Children, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">A law for banckroutes.</NOTE> slaues of the debttor are bounde to the creditor, and when his time is expired and paiment not made, the creditor may take the debter and carie him home to his house, and shut him vp in a <HI>Magazen,</HI> whereby presently he hath his monie, and not beeing able to pay the creditor, hee may take the wife, children, and slaues of the debtor, and sell them, for so is the law of that kingdome. The corant mony that is in this citie, and throughout all this kingdome is called <HI>Gansa</HI> or <HI>Ganza</HI> which is made of Copper and Leade: It is not the monie of the King, but euerie man may stampe it that will, because it hath his iust partition or valure: but they make many of them false by putting ouermuch leade into them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Euery man may stampe what mony <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e will.</NOTE> and those will not passe, neither will any take them. With this money <HI>Ganza,</HI> you may buy Golde or Siluer, Rubies and Muske, and other thinges. For there is no other mony corant amongest them.

<P>This <HI>Ganza</HI> goeth by weight of Byze, and this name of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buy Golde &amp; filuer with copper and leade.</NOTE> <HI>Byza</HI> goeth for the accounpt of the waight, and commonly a <HI>Byza</HI> of a <HI>Ganza</HI> is worth (after our account) halfe a duc∣ket, little more or lesse: and according as Golde and Siluer<NOTE PLACE="marg">The order of their monye.</NOTE> is more or lesse in price, but the <HI>Byza</HI> neuer changeth, euerie <HI>Byza</HI> maketh a hundreth <HI>Ganza</HI> of waight, &amp; so the number of the mony is <HI>Byza.</HI> They that goe to <HI>Pegu</HI> to buy Jewels, and if hée will doe well: it behoueth him to bee a whole yéere

there to doe his businesse, if he will doe it well. For if so bée that hee would returne with the Ship he came in, he cannot<NOTE PLACE="marg">How a man may despose him selfe for the trade in Pegu.</NOTE> doe anie thing well, for the breuity of the time, because that when they custome their goodes in <HI>Pegu:</HI> that come from S. <HI>Tome</HI> in their Shippes: it is as it were about the natiuitie, and when they haue customed their goods, then they must sell it for credite, for a moneth or two: and then at the be∣ginning of March the Shippes depart. The Merchants that come from <HI>S. Tome,</HI> take for the paiment of their goods, gold, and siluer, which is neuer wanting there. And 8. or 10. daies<NOTE PLACE="marg">Good instruc¦tions.</NOTE> before their departure, they are all satisfied: also they may haue Rubies in paiment, but they make no account of them &amp; they that will winter there for another yéere, it is needefull that they be aduertized, that in the sale of their goodes, that they sperify in their bargain, the term of two or thrée mōths paiment, and y<SUP>•</SUP> their paiment shal be in so many <HI>Ganza,</HI> and neither golde nor siluer, because that with the <HI>Ganza</HI> they may buy and sell euerie thing with great aduantage. And howe néedefull it is to be aduertized, that when they will re∣couer their payments: in what order they shall receiue their <HI>Ganza,</HI> because hee that is not practicke may doe him selfe great wrong in the waight of the <HI>Gansa,</HI> as also in the false∣nesse of them, in the waight hee may bee greatly deceiued, because that from place to place, it doth rise and fall great∣ly: and therefore when any man will receiue money or make paiment, hee must take a publique wayer of money: a day or two before hee goe about his businesse, and giue him in pay∣ment for his labour, two <HI>Byza</HI> a moneth, and for this hee is bounde to make good all your mony heerby: and to main∣taine it for good, for that hee receiueth it and seales the bagges with his Seale: and when hee hath receiued any store, there hee causeth it to bee brought into the Maga∣sea of the Merchant, that is the owner of it.</P>
<P>That mony is verie waightie, for forty <HI>Byza</HI> is a great Porters burden, and also where the Merchant hath any paymente to bee made for those goodes, whiche hee buyeth: the Comon wayer of mony that receiueth his
<PB REF="37"/>
mony must make the payment thereof. So that by this means, the Merchant with the charges of two Byzes a mo∣neth, receiueth and payeth out his monie without losse or<NOTE PLACE="marg">The merchan¦dise that goe out of Pegu.</NOTE> trouble. Those merchandise that goe out of the <HI>Pegu</HI> are these, as Gold, Siluer, Rubies, Saphyres, Spynelles, great store of Beniamen, long Peper, Leade, Lacca, Ryce, Wine, some Sugar, yet there might be great store of Sugar made in the Cuntry, for that they haue abundance of Canes, but they giue them to Eliphants to eat, and the people consume great store of them for foode, and many more doe they con∣sume in vaine things as these. In that Kingdome they spend many of these Sugar canes in making of houses and tents which they call <HI>Varely</HI> for their Idoles, which they call <HI>Pagody,</HI> whereof there is great abundance, great &amp; small, and these houses are made in forme to little hilles, like to Sugar loaues or to Belles, and some of these houses are as high as a reasonable stéeple, at the foote they are verie large, that some of them bee in circuit a quarter of a mile, the said<NOTE PLACE="marg">Idoll houses what fashion they are of.</NOTE> houses within are full of earth, and walled round about with brickes and dirt in stead of lyme, and without forme, from the top to the foot they make a couering for them with Sugar Canes, and plaistered with lyme all ouer, for other∣wise they woulde be spoyled, by the great abundance of rain that falleth in those Countreyes, also they consume about these verely or Idoll houses great store of lease Golde, for that they ouerlay al the toppes of the houses with gold, and some of them is couered with Golde from the toppe to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Idoll houses couered with Golde.</NOTE> foote. In couering whereof there is great store of Gold spent, for that euerie ten yeeres they new ouerlay them with gold, from the top to foote, so that with this vanitie they spende great aboundaunce of gold. For euerie ten yeeres the raine doth consume the Golde from these houses. And by this meanes they make Gold dearer in <HI>Pegu</HI> then it would bee, if they cōsumed not so much in this vanitie. Also it is a thing to be noted in the buying of Jewels in <HI>Pegu,</HI> for he that hath no knowledge shall haue as good Jewels, and as good cheap as he that hath beene practized there a long time, which is a
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>
good order, which is this. There is in <HI>Pegu</HI> fowre men of good reputatiō, which are called Tareghe, or brokers of Jewels. These fowre men haue all the Jewels, or Rubies in their handes, and the Merchant that will buy, commeth to one of these Tareghe and telleth him, that he hath so much money to imploy in Rubies. For through the handes of these fowre men passeth all the Rubies: for they haue such quantity, that they knowe not what to doe with them, but sell them at a moste vile and base price. When the Merchant hath broke his minde to on of these Brokers or Tareghe, they carie him hōe to one of their Shops, although he haue no knowledge in Jewels: and when the Jewellers perceiue that hee will employ a good rounde summe, they will make bargaine, and if not, they let him alone. The vse generally of this Citie, is this: y<SUP>•</SUP> when any Merchant hath brought any great quantity of Rubies, and haue agréed for them, the Merchant carieth them home to his house, let them bee of what valure they wil, he shall haue space to looke on them and relooke them two or thrée dayes: and if hee haue no knowledge in them, he shal alwayes haue many Merchants in that City that hath very good knowledge in Jewels: with whome hee may alwayes conferre and take counsell with them, and shewe them vnto whome he will, and if he finde that hee hath not employed his money well, he may returne his Jewelles backe to them whome hee had them of, without any losse at all. Which thing is such a shame to the Tereghe to haue his Jewels re∣turne, that he had rather to beare a blowe on the face then that it shoulde be thought that he shoulde sell them so deere to haue them returned. For these men haue alwayes great care that they make good employmentes, especially to those that haue no knowledge. This they doe, because they woulde not loose their credite: and when those Merchantes that haue knowledge in Jewelles buy any, if they buy them déere it is there owne faults and not the Brokers: yet it is good to haue knowledge in Jewelles, by reason that he may<NOTE PLACE="marg">An honest care of hea then people.</NOTE> somewhat ease the price. There is also a verie good order for which they haue in buying of Jewelles: which is this, there
<PB REF="38"/>
is many merchants that standeth by at the making of the bargaine, and because they shall not vnderstande howe the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bargaines made with the nipping of Fingers vn∣der a cloth.</NOTE> Jewels be solde: The Broker and the Merchants haue their handes vnder a cloth, and by touching of fingers and nip∣ping the ioynts they knowe what is done, what is bidden, and what is asked. So that the standers by know not what is demanded for them, although it be for a thousand or ten thousand Duckets. For euerie ioynt and euerie finger hath his signification. For if the Merchants that stand by, should vnderstand the bargain: it woulde breede great controuersie amongest them, and at my beeinge in <HI>Pegu</HI> in the moneth of August, in Anno 69. and hauing gotten well by my endeuor, I was desirous to sée mine owne Countrie, and I thought<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Authors desire to see his Cuntry.</NOTE> it good to goe by the way of <HI>Saint Tome,</HI> but then I should tarrie vntill March.</P>
<P>In which iourney I was councelled, yea, and fullie resol∣ued to goe by the way of <HI>Bangala,</HI> with a Shippe there rea∣dy to depart for that voyage. And when wee were departed from <HI>Pegu</HI> to <HI>Chitigan,</HI> a greate harbour or port, from whence there goeth small Shippes to <HI>Cochin,</HI> before the fléete departe for Portugall, in which Shippes I was ful∣ly determined, to goe to <HI>Lyshborn,</HI> &amp; so to <HI>Venice.</HI> When I<NOTE PLACE="marg">This Touffon is an extraor∣dinary storme at Sea.</NOTE> had thus resouled my selfe, I went a boord of the Shippe of <HI>Bengala,</HI> at which time it was the yeere of Touffon, and to vnderstand what this Touffon is: vnderstand, that in the Indies often times, there is not stormes as is in other coun∣tries, but euerie ten or twelue yeeres, there is such tempests and stormes, that it is a thing incredible, but to those that haue séene it, neither doe they knowe certaine what yeere it will come.</P>
<P>Unfortunate are they that are at Sea in that yéere, and time of Touffon, because few there are that escape that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Touffon com¦meth but eue¦ry 10. or 12. yeeres.</NOTE> daunger. In this yéere it was our chance to bee at Sea with the like storme, but it happened well vnto vs, for that our Shippe was newly ouer-plancked, and had not any thing in her saue victuall and balastes, Siluer and Golde, whiche from Pegu they carrie to <HI>Bengala,</HI> and no other kinde of

This Touffon or cruell storme endured thrée dayes and thrée nightes, In which time it caried away our sayles, yardes, and Rother, and because the Shippe labou∣red in the Sea, we cut our mast ouer bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd: which when we had done: she laboured a greate deale more then before, for when our Mast was gone, the Shippe laboured worse then before▪ in such wise, that the Shippe was almoste full with Water that came in ouer the highest: and so went downe, and for the space of three dayes and three nightes, sixtie men<NOTE PLACE="marg">A heauy case▪</NOTE> did nothing but bale out Water out of her in this wise, twentie men in one place and twentie men in another place, and twentie in another place: and for all this storme, the Shippe was so good, that shée tooke not one iot of Water a∣lowe through the sides, but all ranne downe through the hatches, that those sixtie men did nothing but cast the Sea into the Sea. And thus driuing two and fro as the winde and Sea woulde, wée were driuen in a darke night about fowre of the clocke and cast on a Sholde, yet when it was day: we coulde neither sée land on one side nor other, &amp; knew not where wee were. And as it pleased the deuine power, there came a great waue of the Sea, and so driue vs beyond the Shold. And when we felt the Ship a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lote, wee rose vp as<NOTE PLACE="marg">A manifest to¦ken of the eb∣bing and flow¦ing in those Cuntries.</NOTE> men reuiued, because the Sea was calme and smoth water, and then sounding we found twelue fadome Water, and within a while after we had but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Fadom, and then pre∣sently, we came to anckor with a small anckor that was left vs with the sterne, for all our other were lost in y<SUP>•</SUP> storme, &amp; by and by the Shippe was a ground and stroke, and then wée did prop her that shee shoulde not ouerthrowe.</P>
<P>When it was day: the ship was all a drye, and found the Shippe a good mile from the sea on drie Lande.

<P>I thinke it verie necessarie before I ende my voyage, to reason somewhat, and to shew what fruits the Indies doth yéelde and bring foorth. First, in the Indies and other East partes of India, there is Peper and Ginger, which groweth in all partes of <HI>India.</HI> And in some partes of the <HI>Indies,</HI> the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pepper tree.</NOTE> greatest quantities of Peper groweth in amongst wilde bu∣shes, without any manner of labour: sauing, that when it is ripe▪ they goe and gather it. The trée that the Peper grow∣eth on, is like to our Juie, which runneth vp to the toppes of trees wheresoeur, and if it should not take hold of some tree, it would ly flat and rotte on the grounde. This Peper trée hath his flower and berry, like in all partes to our Juie ber∣ry, and those berryes be graynes in Peper: so that when they gather them they bee gréene, and then they lay them in the Sunne, and they become blacke.</P>
<P>The Ginger groweth in this wise, the Land is tilled and sowen, and the herbe is like to Panyzzo, and the roote is the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ginger.</NOTE> Ginger. These two spices growe in diuers places.</P>
