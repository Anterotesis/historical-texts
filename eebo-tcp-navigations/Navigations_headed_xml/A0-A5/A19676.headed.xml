<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>F making many books there is no end,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccles. 12.10.</NOTE> said the wise King, many ages past; yet for some arts and fa∣culties, I suppose (even in this printing age of ours) we may complain of scarcitie. For among so many au∣thors ancient and modern, which have written of the Art Militarie, is it not strange that hardly any hath fully handled that which concerneth the Cavallrie? Among the ancients, <HI>Aelian</HI> hath somewhat touched upon the manner of ordering the horse, among the Grecians; and <HI>Vegetius</HI> (where he speaketh of the Romane Cavallrie) lightly passeth it over, and concludeth in<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 26.</NOTE> these words, <HI>De equitatu sunt multa praecepta: sed cùm haec pars militiae usu exercitii, armorum genere, &amp; equorum nobilitate profecerit, ex libris nihil arbitror colligendum, cùm praesens doctrina suffici∣at.</HI> Now the reason why they (bestowing their chief labour about the Infan∣terie) left so little direction for the horse, may be, either because that (both with Grecians and Romanes) the<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Magis reipublicae ne∣cessarii pedites; qui pos∣sunt ubique prodesse. <HI>Veg. lib. 2. cap. 1.</HI></NOTE> foot were of greatest esteem (as that wherein their chief strength consisted, and whereon they principally relyed) &amp; so the lesse regard was had of the horse; or else because the service of horse was not<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Equestris Romaneram militia imperfecta fuit, unde nostra jure potior existimanda est. <HI>Scipio Amiratus, Dissert: po∣lit. lib. 19.</HI></NOTE> grown to that perfection in those times, which it since attain∣ed. For what great effect could be expected of horse using no<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">When they were to charge the enemie, they used to pull off their bridles <HI>T. Liv. lib.</HI> 4.</NOTE> bridle, and having neither<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Lip. ad Polyb. lib. <HI>3. 219. 220.</HI></NOTE> saddle nor stirrops: bearing onely<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Polyb. lib <HI>6.</HI></NOTE> a weak slender pole (which the very motion of the horse would shake in pieces) and a little round target (as the Romanes manner was at first) or else a staffe or kinde of<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Contus.</NOTE> lance (which they afterward used in imitation of the Grecians) with three or foure darts? and having no surer stay to counterpoise their forced motion, what cer∣taintie or violence could they use, either in charging or casting their weapons? and whereas they usually had of the light armed foot<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg"><HI>Caes. Com. lib.</HI> 1. <HI>cap.</HI> 17. So did the Ger∣mans, of whose light armed foot <HI>Caesar</HI> re∣porteth thus; <HI>Tanta erat horum exercitatio∣ne celeritas, ut, jubis equorum sublevatis, cur sum adaequarent.</HI> Com. 1.10.</NOTE> entermingled among them, how could they be so serried together for the shock as to do any great effect in making impressions upon their enemie? which surely was the cause they were often commanded<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">So did the Consul <HI>Valerius</HI> in the warre against the Sabines. <HI>Liv. lib.</HI> 3. And <HI>S. Tempanius,</HI> a∣gainst the <HI>Volsci. idem lib</HI> 4. and many others.</NOTE> to alight, and (forsaking their horses) to fight on foot. But for modern authors there is not the like reason: and yet of so many as have written, none have treated of rules and instructions for the Cavall∣rie, untill lately <HI>George Basta,</HI> Count of the holy Empire, and <HI>Luys Mel∣zo</HI> knight of <HI>Malta,</HI> wrote their books of Cavallrie. These works of theirs afford good directions: but yet it may be said of them as <HI>Aelian</HI> saith of those authors which had written before him,<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Omnes ferè ità unani miter scripsisse, quasi do∣cere homines vellent non ignaros, sed satìs earum rerum peritos, quas expli∣care statuerent. <HI>Aelian. de instruend. acieb. cap. 1.</HI></NOTE> That they had so written, as if none should read them but such as were alreadie skilfull in the art militarie. This defect one <HI>Walhausen</HI> taketh upon him to supply something he hath done in the motions, but for the first rudiments, for the handling of arms &amp;c. he (as all others) is silent. But these and the like being written in the forrain lan∣guages, and among so many of our militarie pamphlets none treating of Ca∣vallrie; I have adventured (though altogether unfit for such a task) to employ some idle houres in the diligent reading, and conferring of the said authors to∣gether with such other books and informations as I could obtain out of the Low-countreys and other places, for my better satisfaction herein:<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Lapides &amp; ligna ab aliis accipio, adificii tamen extructio &amp; forma, no∣stra. Nec aranearum sa∣nè textus ideo melior, quia ex se fila gignunt: nec noster vilior, quia ex alienis libamus, ut apes. <HI>Lips. Polit.</HI></NOTE> endea∣vouring
<PB REF="4"/> to extract the marrow and quintessence of their prolixer discourses, and to digest them into such a method, as I conceived might afford brevi∣tie and perspicuitie: wherein I have observed to go upon good grounds, affir∣ming nothing of mine<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Nihil mihi authoritatis assumo, sed horum, quos suprà retuli, ea quae di∣spersa sunt, velut in ordi∣nem epitomata conscribo. <HI>Veget. lib. 1. cap. 18.</HI></NOTE> owne authoritie. It is true, I have sometimes made bold to dissent from others, but adding my reason, and leaving the judicious reader to his libertie. For the stile, I conceived the<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Neque curiosam ali∣quam verborum inanita∣tem conquirentes, sed verbis tantùm communi∣bus planísque usi, milita∣rem dicendi formam po∣tissimùm secuti sumus. <HI>Leo Tact. in Epilogo.</HI></NOTE> bluntest and plainest to be most proper for this subject. If my annotations be displeasing to any, they may use them like countrey stiles, and step over them. To others they may serve to shew the truth of that assertion, That a<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Proved at large by S<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Cl. Edmonds,</HI> in his pre∣face to <HI>Caesars commen∣taries</HI> by him transla∣ted.</NOTE> meer practicall knowledge cannot make a perfect souldier: for had we not been beholding to<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Apud veteres res mili∣tatis in oblivionem saepi∣us venit, sed à libris repe∣tita est, postea ducum authoritate firmata. <HI>Veg. lib. 3. cap. 10.</HI></NOTE> books, the militarie art (in all likelihood) had been utterly obscured from our know∣ledge. For what is there in these modern warres, which is not borrowed from antiquitie? wherein we follow them step by step (<HI>mutatis mutandis,</HI> the later inventions of fire weapons, and the use and dependencie there of onely excepted) not onely in their manner, but even retaining their very words of command; as in this treatise is partly shewed, and would be more manifestly apparent if the subject were Infanterie; which no way disparageth the modern practise, but rather (for the antiquitie of it) gives it the more respect and estimation.</P>
<P>Now, lest the <HI>Tyro</HI> or untutored horseman should be deterred, and should judge his task to be overgreat; I have set down a table of the chapters, that so he may apply himself, onely to those things (at first) which are princi∣pally necessarie for him to know and practise.</P>
<P>The defects of our trained bands of horse, will argue the work neither unne∣cessarie nor unseasonable, had it but had the hap to light into the hands of a better workman. But as I have seen when an excellent musician could not be intreated to handle an instrument, some bungler hath fallen upon it; which caused the musician (out of impatience and indignation) to undertake it; so, if these essaies may be a means to incite some one or other, better able,<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Nam cùm hoc opus, usús potiùs aliorum, quàm meae commendationis causâ ag∣gressus sim, adjuvari me ab bis, qui aliquid illi astruent, non argui cre∣dam <HI>Frontin. in praef</HI></NOTE> to put pen to paper, I shall think my pains abundantly rewarded. In the mean time I desire they may be received with the right hand, as they are offered; and conclude in the words of the <HI>Poet,</HI>

<P>He must also advisedly choose commodious places for the quarters or lodgings, providing good guards, causing the highwayes to be scoured or discovered, placing men on

When the com∣panies be entered into garrison, the souldiers which are on foot must presently be remounted; that so, in the time of winter, they may at leisure fit their horses for service: for be∣ing only remounted at the time of their going into the field, the<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Equos assuluo labore convenit edomari.</HI> Veg. lib. 2. cap. 14.</NOTE> horses are not fitted for service, and being yong and not used to the bridle, by any little toile they become un∣profitable: besides, when a man is put (on the suddain) to buy such as he findeth, they prove not onely the worser, but the dearer. Moreover, those souldiers which want horses are of no service; and these are they (usually) which straggle disbanded, and do most mischief about the quarters. And because oftentimes there is not money assigned apart to re∣mount the souldiers, it were good that among the compa∣nies there were a brother-hood or fellowship erected,
<PB N="25" REF="17"/> (which the Spanish call <HI>Platta</HI>) which consisteth in making a cash, wherein the money which is gathered to that end, is kept; as followeth. First, the souldiers of every companie choose foure of their most judicious fellows, with con∣sent of the Captain. These, with the farrier of the compa∣nie, must view all the horses of their companie, prising eve∣ry one according to his value, and concealing it from the souldiers, to avoid disputes: and of this prising they must keep a record, that so, if any horse happen to die, it may be known what is to be allowed; provided alwayes, that they go no higher then 50 crowns. To raise this cash, the Captain must give order, that a crown be defalked out of every souldiers first pay, foure realls out of a third of pay, and eight out of the contributions of a moneth: or else this proporti∣on to be for the first beginning, and afterwards the moytie; or more or lesse as need shall require.</P>
<P>Every horse dying in service, or by mischance, without the souldiers fault, shall be made good to the souldier that lost him.</P>
<P>If a souldiers horse be killed, or otherwise die whilest he is abroad (with the Captains or Officers leave) about his private busines, he shall not be allowed for the same.</P>
<P>If a souldier by negligence or malice hurt his horse, or use him so ill that he die; he shall not onely beare the losse of him, but be chastised by his superiours, and chased from the companie.</P>
<P>The Captains must take care that the said deputed soul∣diers and the farrier visit all the horses of the companie once every week: and finding any not fit for service, to sell them, and buy others.</P>
<P>The said deputies must admonish the souldiers to give their horses good use, as is fitting, giving them oats ordina∣rily; and against such as they finde to do otherwise, to pro∣ceed as abovesaid.</P>
<P>These courses will be found very available to preserve the horse; but when the companies are in the field, by occa∣sion of combats, sometime twentie, or twentie five, or more horses being lost in a day out of one entire companie, in such cases the said cash is not of sufficiencie to supplie them, but the Prince is to furnish them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXVII. Of exercise in particular.</HI> Of managing of the horse and arms.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He Cavallrie being to be exercised, must be in∣structed how to manage their horse and their arms.</P>
<P>Concerning the horse (presupposing him to be of sufficient stature and strength, nimble of joynts, and sure of foot &amp;c.) he must (of necessitie) be made fit for service, so as you may have him ready at command to pace, trot, gallop, or runne in full careere; also to advance, stop, retire, and turn readily to either hand, and all with alacritie and obedi∣ence. Now, to bring him to this readie turning, he is to be ridden the ring, and figure 8, first in a great compasse, and so in a lesse by degrees; first upon his pace, then on the trot, and so to the gallop and careere. These things he may be taught by using the hand, leg and voice. For the hand (ob∣serving not to move the arm, but onely the wrist) if you would have him to face to the left, a little motion of the little finger on that rein, and a touch of the left leg) with∣out
<PB N="35" REF="23"/> using the spurre) doth it: if to face (or turn) to the left a∣bout, a harder, &amp;c. If you would have him to trot, you are to move both your legges a little forward; for the gallop, to move them more forward, and for the careere to yerk them most forward, and to move the bodie a little forward with it. After every motion performed, it were good to keep him a while in that motion, as when you bid him stand, to stand a while, &amp;c. Also it were not amisse, after every thing well done, to give him some bread or grasse as a reward. For the voice, you may use the vvords, Advance, hold, turn, or the like, but because the voice cannot alwayes be heard, it were good to use him chiefly to the motions of the hand and leg. It will also be very usefull to teach him to go sidewayes: this he may be brought unto by laying his provender somewhat farre from him in the manger, and keeping him from turning his head towards it. He must also be used to the smell of gunpowder, the sight of fire and armour, and the hearing of shot, drummes and trumpets, &amp;c. but by degrees and vvith discretion. When he is at his oats (at a good distance from him) a little povvder may be fired, and so nearer to him by degrees. So may a pistoll be fired some distance off, and so nearer: in like manner a drumme or trumpet may be used. The groom may sometime dresse him in armour, and he may be used (novv and then) to eat his oats from the drumme head. It vvill be very usefull some∣time to cause a musketier to stand at a convenient distance, and both of you to give fire upon each other, and thereupon to ride up close to him: also to ride him against a compleat armour, so set upon a stake, that he may overthrovv it, and trample it under his feet: that so (and by such other means) your horse (finding that he receiveth no hurt) may become bold to approach any object. He may also be used to moun∣tanous and uneven vvayes, and be exercised to leap, svvimme, and the like. But for further directions for the art of riding and managing the horse, I referre the reader to<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Besides many of our owne writers; <HI>Pierre de la Noüe</HI> in his Cavallerie Fran∣choise et Italienne. <HI>also</HI> Instruction du Roy (de France) en l'exercice de mon∣ter a Cheval, par Antoyne de Plubi∣nel. lately published, and divers others.</NOTE> them vvhich have vvritten of horse-manship <HI>ex professo,</HI> vvhose books are every vvhere obvious.</P>

Savilc. &amp;c.</NOTE> many have taken pains to revive unto us the knowledge of those arms which sometime were in use among the Graecians, Romanes, and other nations, which have been for many ages totally abolished.</P>
<P>The manner of carrying the lance, is either advanced, or couched, that is, when it is carried so abased, as the enemie can hardly discover it untill he feel the shock.</P>
<P>The charging of the lance is twofold, either by the right, or left.</P>
<P>The right is, when it is presented or charged along by the right side of the horse.</P>
<P>The left is, when it is born acrosse the neck of the horse, by the left eare.</P>
<P>The first is the manner used by the Turks and Hunga∣rians, and by some preferred before the other. One reason which they give for it, is, because that in charging by the left, the Lancier must incline his bodie to the left, and so sitteth the lesse sure in his saddle.</P>
<P><HI>Basta</HI> would have the second way to be best. Howsoever, all agree that a Lancier must ever strive to gain the left side of his enemie, and charge him on the left.</P>
<P>Now there be three wayes of charging; </P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 By carrying the lance sloaped upwards.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 By charging it levell, in a straight line.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 By charging it sloaping, or inclining downwards.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The first is, if against Cavallrie, to take the sight of the

<PB REF="25"/>
<PB N="37" REF="25"/> enemie with the point of the lance; or, if against foot, the head or neck of either pike or musketier.</P>
<P>The second is, by charging a horse-man about the middle, (to bear him out of the saddle) or on the breast of the foot.</P>
<P>The third serveth to pierce the breast of the enemies horse, or a kneeling musketier, or pike charging at the foot against horse.</P>
<P>These three severall wayes must be diligently practised, and require much dexteritie: to which end a stake is to be set up, having an arm (as it were) stretched out from it, and thereunto a white (either of paper or linen) fastned, at seve∣rall heights, which the Lancier must exercise himself to hit in full careere; also to take up a glove (or the like) from the ground with the point of his lance, &amp;c. All which is shown <HI>figure</HI> 2. <HI>part</HI> 1. <HI>chap.</HI> 28. In his charging of the enemie, he begins upon his pace or trot,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Monsieur <HI>de la Noüe,</HI> blameth the French for their er∣rour in this point.

Against an armed Lancier, the best way of char∣ging is judged to be, not after the two first wayes, but by the third, that is, at the breast of the horse, and that towards the left side of him, where his heart and vitals are; and for this, the charging by the right is held best.</P>
<P>Having given his charge with the lance, so as it becometh unusefull to him, he must betake himself to his pistoll, in the use whereof he is to be very skilfull. His last refuge is his sword, which he must also be well practised in. Of both which weapons shall be spoken in the next chapter.</P>

<P>But the more compendious way of lading, for the gain∣ing of time (which in the instant of skirmish is chiefly to be regarded) is by using cartouches. Now, the cartouch is to be made of white paper, cut out of convenient breadth and length, and rowled upon a stick, (or the rammer, if it be not too little) fit (according to the bore of the barrell) to contain a due quantitie of powder, &amp; the bullet. The proportion of powder usually required is half the weight of the bullet; but that is held too much by such as can judge. Having moul∣ded the paper, the one end of it is to be turned in (to keep in the powder) and the due charge of powder to be put into it, at the other end; which powder is to be closed in by tying a little thred about the paper: then the bullet is to be put in, and that also tyed in with a little thred. When the Cuirassi∣er is to use his cartouch, he must bite off the paper at the head of it, and so put it into the barrell of his pistoll, with the bullet upward, and then ramme it home. By<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">For the more speedy lading of the pistoll, and avoiding the trouble of carrying either flasque or touchbox, there is a late invented fashion of spanner or key, (which I have repre∣sented in <HI>figure</HI> 1) which contains six charges of powder (at the least) and priming powder sufficient for those charges, &amp; for the cartouches where∣with the pistoll cases be furnished: which the Cuirassier will finde to be of very good use, when he is used thereunto.</NOTE> this means he shall much expedite the lading of his pistoll.

Having spent both his pistols, and want∣ing time to lade again, his next refuge is his sword; whereof the best manner of using is to place the pummell of it upon his right<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">As is shewed in the <HI>posture</HI> 22.</NOTE> thigh, and so with his right hand to direct or raise the point to his mark, higher or lower as occasion serveth: either at the bellie of the adverse horse-man (about the pummell of the saddle) or at his arm pits, or his throat, where if it pierce not, (as it is very like it will not fail, by slipping under the casque) yet meeting with a stay in that part of the bodie, where a man is very weak, and having a sword of a very stiffe blade, (as afore-said) it will doubtlesse unhorse him. Being past his enemie, he is to make a back-blow at him, aiming to cut the buckle of his pouldron, whereby he disarmeth one of his arms, &amp;c. <HI>Basta</HI> highly commendeth the aiming at the enemies fight, and so (by raising the vizures of his casque with the point of the sword to runne him into the head.

<P>In these and the like exercises the Cuirassier is frequently and diligently to practise himself at some mark; which will render him fit for service when need shall require.</P>
<P>Some authors (for the disposing of the Cuirassiers for fight) hold that they ought to be ordered in grosse bodies, that so (<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">The Cuirassiers a∣mong the horse, are like the <HI>gravis armatu∣ra</HI> of foot among the Romanes, <HI>quae tanquam murus ferreus stabat, &amp; si hostes fugâsset, non se∣quebatur; quia ejus jus est, facilè nec fugere, nec sequi.</HI> Veg. lib. 2. cap. 17.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXXII.</HI> Of exercising the Cavallrie in their motions.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>Aving shewed how every horse-man is to be exercised in the managing of his horse, as also in the use of his particular arms; it follow∣eth now that he be taught how to demean himself, being joyned in a bodie.</P>
<P>And here, before we enter into the motions, it were fit to explain the terms of<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><P>The Graecians and Romanes had the same order of exercise, and that in the same words, which we re∣tain to this day.</P>
<P>A file, the Romanes called <HI>Versus,</HI> and <HI>De∣curia:</HI> A rank, <HI>Jugum.</HI> A file-leader, <HI>Decanus,</HI> because their <HI>decuria</HI> (or file) used to con∣sist of 10 among the foot, with some 16. a bringer up, <HI>Tergi∣ductor:</HI> a leader (be∣ing every odde man in the file) <HI>Prostes:</HI> a follower (which is every even number) <HI>Substes:</HI> a side-man, <HI>Astes.</HI></P>

They ordered their horse-troops at 6 foot distance be∣tween file and file, in march, and 3 foot in fight.</P></NOTE> art therein used, and to shew what is meant by a file, a rank, half files, and half ranks; the front, flanks, and reere, and the like. But (for brevitie sake) I passe them over, referring the reader to the books of Infanterie.</P>
<P>To exercise the horse, they are to be drawn up into a bo∣die, not by ranks, but by files: and those of 5 deep, as most affirm, or of 6, as others would have it, and that because the number of 5 is not divisible by 2, and so in doubling of ranks, or half files, or the like, there is alwaies an odde rank. Some would have them (especially the Harquebusiers) to be 8 in file, taking the troop to consist of 64. Being put in <HI>Batta∣lia,</HI> that is, ordered into a square bodie, and silence strictly commanded; the first thing to be taught them, is distance. And herein authors disagree. Some make close order to be 2 paces; open order, 4 paces, and so for double, triple, and qua∣druple distance proportionable. Others make but 2 kindes of distances: Close order, which is 3 foot: and open order, which is 6 foot. But this must be understood <HI>cum grano sa∣lis:</HI> (as the Civilians speak) for here we must observe a diffe∣rence between the manner of taking the distance of the Ca∣vallrie, and that of the Infanterie: for in the foot, the di∣stance is taken from the center of the souldiers bodie, which here cannot be so understood, but onely of the space of ground between horse and horse.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>de Praissac</HI> is more plain, who would have the distance between rank and rank (both for the length of the horse, as also for the space between horse and horse) to be six paces, &amp; one pace between file and file. Yet, if we take every pace for five foot (as that is the usuall dimention) by
<PB N="46" REF="32"/> this rule they should be at a verie large distance.</P>
<P>In my opinion, the Cavallrie, being to be exercised in their motions, should be at ther distance of six foot, or open order (taking it as hath been shewed) <SUP>d</SUP> standing right in their ranks and files.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Omnes milites inceden∣di ordinem servent. <HI>Veg. 1.9.</HI> Ʋt aquali legitimóque spatio miles distet à milite, nec ultrà quàm expedit, aut con∣globent agmen aut la∣xent. <HI>ibid. cap. 26.</HI></NOTE></P>

<P>Doubling of files, or doubling by half ranks serveth to strengthen the flanks.</P>

<P>The use of wheelings, is to bring the front (which is al∣wayes supposed to consist of the ablest men) to be readie to receive the charge of the enemie on either flank or reere.</P>
<P>These motions (for the more easie apprehension of the untutored souldier) are represented in figures, by a companie of Harquebusiers of 64 men. And therein the file-leaders and bringers up are distinguished by a differing letter, as followeth.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He alarm place is that place without the vil∣lage, where the souldiers are to assemble to withstand an assailing enemie, being a place of great consequence.</P>
<P>In the election of this place, consideration must be had of the scituation of the villages and countrey, whether it be large or strait; also of the time, whether it be by day or night: again, whether the Cavallrie be lodged together, or in severall villages. If together in one village, and in the night, (when the enemie may come upon them the more at unaware, as not being discoverable very farre) then this place must not be in front of the village, as being too neare the enemies approach, whereby it might be seised on by him, and so your men cut off one after another as they come thither to assemble themselves: but it must be on the sides or flanks of the village, though the baggage be hazarded; which<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">This all ages have verified. The States men (by a stratagem) had surprised S<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Her∣togen-Bosh, anno</HI> 1585. but by reason of the covetousnesse of the souldiers (neglecting their charges, to fall to pillaging) were beaten out again with losse. <HI>Meteren. lib,</HI> 12.</NOTE> inviting the enemie to pillaging, often giveth him occasion of disorder. But in the day time it were best to be in front, shewing the more courage.</P>
<P>If the Cavallrie be quartered in diverse villages (which often happeneth, especially in places little suspected) the qua∣litie of the countrey must be considered. Some villages may be backed with rivers, &amp; so give but one entrance to the enemie: then the generall place of arms or rendez-vous shall be in the center. And those villages which are exposed to the first brunt, shall be as corps-de-guards to assure the rest. These (upon alarm given) must assemble in their particular
<PB N="70" REF="48"/> alarm places, from thence they shall advance, united to re∣ceive the charge, though the enemie farre exceed them in number: and must sustain him so long, till they may be as∣sured that the rest are all met at the generall Rendez-vous, whither (being forced by the enemie) they shall retreat by little and little, the other advancing to relieve them. If the countrey be open, so as the enemie may assail which he please, then they must use those diligences as when the Ca∣vallrie is lodged altogether in one village. They which are first assaulted must make resistance untill the other be met at the generall Rendez-vous.</P>
<P>Touching the order of their assembling together in the alarm place, the Commissarie Generall, or Quarter-master Generall, overnight appointeth a certain place for every troop, where they shall stand, which way faced, &amp;c.</P>

The Corps-de-guard must be in the middle of the village. The guards, being disposed in their places, must be every night visited by the Commissarie Generall (which often the Lieutenant Generall, and sometime the Generall himself ought to do) to keep the souldiers in the greater awe. The Generalls companie is exempt from the ordi∣narie guards and convoyes, because they must be a guard to the Generall, (unlesse the Generall go in person) and so is the Lieutenant Generalls companie.</P>
<P>The companies entring the guard, must be compleatly armed, and sound their trumpets; their Lieutenant taking information of all things from the Lieutenant which go∣eth from the guard, and then certifying his captain, who is to acquaint his superiour officers with all occurrences, and
<PB N="71" REF="48"/> with the reports of such as went to discover and scower the high wayes, also of the convoye, and other duties.</P>
<P>If the Cavallrie lodge in severall villages (which ever must not be farre distant from each other) in everie village a companie must have the guard and Sentinells.</P>

<P>In the day time, if there be any open champain with∣in half a league (or thereabout) of the quarter, the com∣panie which hath the guard shall send out a Corporall with 12 or 15 horse, which shall hide himself in some covert place neare the entrance of the said champain. There he shall place double Sentinels in some eminent place, who seing some Cavallrie, one shall go to descrie them, the other shall go and tell the Corporall; who sending word to the Corps-du-guard, shall advance at large, sending out 2 horses to take knowledge of the said Cavallrie. If there be some high tree neare the place where the said Corporall stood, he may thereon place a Sentinell, and save the sending out of the said 2 Sentinels. These horse shall be changed (or relieved) twice a day, by those which have the guard. If the enemie charge them, they are to retreat to the said entrance and there to entertain the enemie till they of the guard can be readie (upon the former notice given them) and come to second them.</P>
<P>If all the Cavallrie go to oppose the enemie, the Captain of the guard shall have the vanguard. If more companies then one be employed for guard, that companie shall have it, neare which the alarm was given.</P>
<P>Sometime it so happeneth as that the troops come to their quarter in the night and in ill weather, so as the adve∣nues cannot be observed, nor fitting places for the guards nor Sentinels: Then the Commissarie Generall (or the Ge∣nerall himself) is to go and appoint them as he shall judge most convenient: appointing to every companie 10 souldi∣ers of guard, (more or lesse as need shall require) and com∣manding all to be in readinesse, giving order to the Corps-du-guard (as the onely remedie) that if the enemie assail the quarter, they go resolutely &amp; charge him: which (besides the

Better it is that (after 2 or 3 houres refreshing) in such cases, the companies be caused to go out into the champain, every<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Si fiut ista cattelae, nihil nosturni aut diur∣ni superventus hostium nocere possunt. <HI>Veg. lib. 3. cap. 10.</HI></NOTE> souldier taking with him some oats and other re∣freshments; placing the Corps-de-guards as shall be thought fit, and not giving eare to the murmuring of the souldiers. But if the weather be rainie and tempestuous, such as that they must be under shelter, every officer (by certain houres) shall divide the night, and go from house to house, knock∣ing and calling to the souldiers, causing them to saddle their horses. A while after him, another is to enter the houses, and see every souldier armed and ready to mount, punishing those that are sluggish.</P>

<P>In the night (if it may be) they shall be placed in valleys, because from thence one seeth best what cometh from the higher ground. They shall suffer no person (whosoe∣ver he be) to enter or go out of the quarter; but causing him to stand at 30 or 40 paces distance from them, the one shall go and certifie his officer; who (<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Since the Prince of <HI>Parma's</HI> time, the Sentinells have not been trusted with the word: by reason of a miscarriage at the siedge at <HI>Tournay,</HI> which the States men relieved by wresting the word from a Cen∣tinell.</NOTE> having the watch-word) shall go and take notice of him, and know his businesse in that place, and at that time.</P>

But if the enemie perceived him, he shall cause a Carabine or two to be discharged, and shall speedily dispatch away a soul∣dier to certifie the quarter. Or if the enemies number be great, he shall set on fire some house thereabout, they of the quarter knowing beforehand wherefore it is done. And sending two souldiers with more certain news, they shall give fire to their Carabines when they be so neare the quarter as that they may be heard, thereby to give them the more time to get ready. If the quarter be in a very suspicious place, more companies of discoverers must be sent out, and they are to have a countersigne given them (as the name of some town, &amp;c.) to know each other by in the night.</P>
<P>Alarms (though false) cannot be prevented, it being in the enemies choice to shew himself as often as he please, happily for no other intent but to weary your souldiers; or by that stratagem to make them secure and carelesse. To remedie this, the Captains use to give the alarm secretly (vvithout sound or noise) by silent advices; that so the enemy vaunt not of putting you to trouble, but wearie himself And thus the horrour of the sounds of trumpets and noise of warlike cries is avoided, which hinder the hearing of the Commanders directions. But if the enemie charge the said Discoverers or Sentinells so heard, as that they have no opportunitie to send word, but the enemie puts on to enter the quarter with them (which is the best way for him to compasse his purpose) then they shall (flying to the quarter) give the alarm with firings of the Harquebusiers and calling out aloud, entering not at the usuall wayes; but at the pri∣vate ones, to give the enemie occasion of suspence, not knowing whither they might draw him on. Moreover,
<PB N="77" REF="51"/> when the alarm is thus secretly given (as before shewed) and having some notice of the enemies forces how strong they are in number, you may cause your souldiers to mount with all possible secrecie, and order them for fight, on the flank of the enemies advenue, leaving the Sentinels (with some trumpets) there standing, with command that, when the enemie approacheth them, they shall<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><P>Such a stratagem was used by <HI>S<SUP>r</SUP> Fran.

Therefore, that these forragers may the better be secured, there must alwaies be a good grosse of Infanterie and Cavallrie sent with them, under the command of a chief officer, or at least a well ex∣perienced Captain. The Provost or one of his assistants is to go with them, to punish such as are exorbitant or straggle.

<P>It is not fit to go twice together to one place to forrage, lest the enemie knowing it, watch an opportunitie.

By this means the forragers having fi∣nished their forraging, make their retreat safely; to which purpose also one or two troops of 25 horse a piece use to march upon the flanks of the forragers. When all the for∣ragers are marching back again towards the quarter, all the convoy marcheth in the reare; it being unlikely that the ene∣mie will set upon them with any great forces between their convoy and their quarter.</P>

<PB N="86" REF="55"/>
<P>If he cannot (by other means) get knowledge how their guards are kept, and other duties either observed or neglect∣ed; he may conjecture by the<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Ad rem pertinet qualis ipse adversarias vel ejus comitos sint, nósse: utrùm temerarii an cauti; auda∣ces, an timidi; scientes ar∣tem bellicam, an ex usa temerè pugnantes, &amp;c. <HI>Veg. lib. 3. cap. 9.</HI></NOTE> qualities of their Chief, whe∣ther he be a good souldier or not; whether he be proud and hastie, or that he be advised and deliberate: for ignorance joyned with a naturall furie causeth a man to despise his enemie, and to think it a disparagement to him (as an argu∣ment of feare) to use such cautelous courses in assuring his quarter; especially knowing himself the stronger.</P>
<P>In the assailing of his quarter, there are two things to be observed;</P>
<P N="1">1 To make your approaches as neare the village as pos∣sible may be.</P>
<P N="2">2<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">In campis sparsis atque securis, opportunum prae∣lium infertur, exceptis superventibus vel incursi∣onibus repentium ex occa∣sione, quam nunquam dux exercitatus amittit. <HI>Veg. lib. 3. cap. 19</HI></NOTE> To hinder him from uniting his troops into a bodie.</P>
<P>Touching the first, the first troop shall advance (without any forerunners) as secretly as may be: and assoon as they perceive themselves to be discovered (without loosing a moment of time) shall charge the Sentinels, and enter the quarter with them, and surprise the Corps-de-guard before they be able to mount on horseback.</P>
<P>For the second, there must be an exquisite observance of the orders given, and not a man to disband. Suppose the enemie hath 1000 horse and you but 500, you may fitly di∣vide your forces into five troops. The first having surprised the Corps-de-guard (as before mentioned) shall from thence passe to the market-place, with resolution to sustain any re∣sistance which they shall meet with. The second troop (perceiving the quarter invested) shall follow upon the gal∣lop closely united, and finding no resistance, shall possesse the alarm place, and send some horse to run through the streets, to keep the souldiers in; and to hinder them from mounting on horseback.</P>
<P>The third shall come fairely on to the said place, and so the fourth; which (leaving the third there firm) shall hasten to the place where they heare the most noise: then shall they alight and enter the houses, putting to the sword what enemies they finde. The running of these horse through the streets, hindering the souldiers to mount, will surely make them think rather<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Nec insequentium ul¦lum periculum est, cùm victi (quibus defendi po∣terant) arma converterint in fugam. <HI>Ibid. cap. 21.</HI></NOTE> of escaping by flight through the gardens or otherwise, then of resisting: neither can there (in
<PB N="87" REF="55"/> such a tumult) be good orders given or observed. There∣fore the fift troop hearing the noise cease, may conjecture there is no need of there help to take the village; and so shall divide themselves into two parts, and inviron the quarter on the outside, to hinder the enemies flight on foot. The horse-boyes may fire a house or two, especially where the enemie shall endeavour to fortifie: then (as the souldiers) to enter the houses to pillage and take pri∣soners, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Another way of assailing the quarter, is this. The ene∣mies camp removing, the Chief or Captain must labour to inform himself of the place where he purposeth to lodge that night; and where the quarter for the Cavallrie shall be: which may easily be learned, because overnight it is usually published: or having good knowledge of the countrey, he may conjecture it. He must consider the number of his enemies horse, and of his owne, and though he be inferiour by half (as beforesaid) yet may his enterprise take good effect, if it be well carried. He must fit the time<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Nam vel celeriùs vel tardiùs aliquò pervenire quàm constitutum est, propositum persaepe no∣strum intervertit. <HI>Leo Tact. cap. 15. 42.</HI></NOTE> so justly, as that he may come to the enemies quarter in the evening, before the guards be disposed, or the orders given. And if the di∣stance were such, as that he must march when the enemie marcheth, he shall depart from his quarter with all secrecie, and<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg"><P>A good commander (like a good wrastler) ought to make shew of one thing, and to put another in pra∣ctise: to the end to de∣ceive the enemie, and gain the victorie. <HI>Ibid. cap.</HI> 20.</P>

And (when he thinketh fit) he shall face about, and march on the flank of the enemie as covertly as may be. But to do this two things must be observed; 1 That your march be through your friends countrey. 2 That you have more then one spie in the enemies Cavallrie, so as they be not able to stirre without your knowledge.

<P>To order your embuscadoes (or ambushes) as they ought, you must first know what number of Cavallrie the enemie hath: if he have fewer horse then you, you may employ all yours; attempting to draw out all his, and to rout them. Or else you may employ some small number, by which you may (at severall times) make some good bootie, the enemie not daring to issue out of his quarter. But if the enemie ex∣ceed you in horse, it is not convenient for you to make em∣buscadoes, unlesse it be with some few horse: for being a small number you may easilie retreat; but being a grosse, it
<PB N="90" REF="57"/> might be entertained by part of the enemies Cavallrie pre∣sently issuing, and those seconded by more, whereby you should be hardly able to retreat without disorder, and losse.</P>

So pro∣portioning the time, as that they might arrive at the place appointed for ambush before day, that so they may give time to lay their embuscadoe under favour of the night. The said troops arriving long before day, they are to be kept firm on the plain, and Sentinells are to be placed on every side. In the mean time you<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Qui superventus &amp; in sidias subsessas passus est, culpam suam non potest excusare: quia haec evi∣tare potuit, &amp; per specu∣latores idoneos ante co¦gnoscere. <HI>Veg. lib. 3. cap. 22.</HI></NOTE> must diligently search and dis∣cover about the place appointed for your embuscadoe, lest there should be any ambush of the enemies: then (being assured for that) you are to lay your embuscadoe before the dawning of the day, and to place Sentinells in places conve∣nient, where they may be unseen: some on trees, others couched on the ground, to discover such places as they can∣not discrie from the trees. The embuscadoe must not be laid much before break of day, because (otherwise) they cannot discover the approach of the enemie, but at hand, and so the embuscadoe should have no time to come forth, and put themselves in order; and being so taken on the sudden,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Deprehensa subsessa, si circumveniatur ab hoste, plus periculi sustinet quàm parabat inferre. <HI>Ibid. cap. 6.</HI></NOTE> they might be defeated in their own ambush. Besides, in that re∣mainder of the night, many might be overcome with sleep, and not use that vigilance which is required. The troops must be placed at good distances one from another, that so they intermix not, nor hinder each other in time of fight. In making the embuscadoe with a grosse of Cavallrie, some number of Infanterie must be laid in ambush about the mid-way, to sustain the Cavallrie in their retreat (if need were) or otherwise to assist them upon occasion.<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg"><P><HI>With antiquitie em∣buscadoes were very frequent and were to be used by either par∣tie.</HI></P>

And indeed, to be the better assured of the good successe of an ambush, it should be ac∣companied with some new and extraordinarie invention.</P>
<P>If the Chief of a frontier garrison will attempt to endam∣mage
<PB N="91" REF="57"/> the enemie by an ambush, being inferiour in strength to the enemy, he must gather together so many of the troops of his neighbour garrisons, untill he be superiour. And by making embuscadoes two or three times in this manner, it will terrifie the enemie; in so much as that it may be conje∣ctured, that though afterward he make embuscadoes with fewer horse, the enemie will not hazard to come forth, and so he may the safelier take bootie. When the armie march∣eth, there is usually some Cavallrie left behinde in embusca∣doe in some eminent place, from whence they may discover farre off, by that means to be secured from the enemies Ca∣vallrie, which usually is sent to charge the reare of the marching armie, to take some prisoners, or to get intelli∣gence. But these must not go to their place of ambush by the right way, but having passed the place, they must return to it by some by-way, lest the enemie following them, dis∣cover them by their footing.</P>
<P>To employ all the Cavallrie (supposed to be 4000, in 40 troops) in Embuscadoe, three troops must be sent before towards the enemie, under an able Commander, giving no∣tice onely to him and the Captains where the embuscadoe shall be; &amp; letting none of the souldiers know that any more horse are to follow them, lest any of them (in the enemies charge) being taken prisoner, should reveal it to the enemie. Of these three troops, 100 are to be sent to the enemies camp, viz 50 Cuirassiers with their Captain and Lieutenant; &amp; 50 Harquebusiers with their Lieutenant. Of these Harque∣busiers<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Pauci equites praemit∣tuntur, vallida manus per alia mittitur loca: primi ubi ad agmen ini∣micorum pervenerunt equites, tentant leviter atque discedunt, &amp;c. tunc illa Manus superve∣niens, opprimit ignoran∣tes. <HI>ibid.</HI></NOTE> 25 shall advance before with a good Corporall, at∣tempting to take horses, prisoners &amp;c. as they shall be able. In view of these Harquebusiers; at the distance of a ca∣non shot, 25 Cuirassiers must make <HI>Alto,</HI> under command of their Lieutenant, to receive those 25 Harquebusiers when they return with bootie. The Captain, with the other 25 Cuirassiers &amp; 25 Harquebusiers shall, keep behinde some half league off, divided into two troops; the Harquebusiers being placed nearest the enemie in convenient manner, partly to succour the said 50 horse (which likely will be charged by the horse of the enemies guards) &amp; also to make their re∣treat, wherein the Cuirassiers are of principall use. These 4 troops must still retreat in fitting distance one from another,
<PB N="92" REF="58"/> one of them still turning face to the enemie; unlesse the ene∣mie so charge them as they must be forced to flie in disorder. The other 200 horse (being 150 Cuirassiers, and 50 Har∣quebusiers) shall enter the embuscadoe, with their Chief, about half an houres riding off from the other 50 horse, which when they see returning and charged, they shall issue out: The 50 Harquebusiers first giving a charge rank after rank, then the Cuirassiers, leaving 20 horse in the reare to make the retreat.</P>
<P>The grosse (which had taken another way, lest the ene∣mie should perceive by the footing that there was a greater number, and so should stay or turn back) must be in ambush about an houres march behinde the said 200 horse. And seeing them return charged (as surely they will, the enemie thinking himself the stronger) shall suffer them to passe, and the enemie also, that so they may charge them on the reare when they see their time. For better assurance, it were good to lead out with them (as before was intimated) some<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg"><HI>C.

These foot must take heed they be not discovered untill the ene∣mie be come up to them, and then shall give them a full volly to disorder them. Upon this, the grosse of Cavallrie (now issued out) shall charge them on the reare and flanks: and then the said 300 horse are to face about, and sustain the charge; by all which means it is not like that the ene∣mie can escape without much losse.</P>
<P>According to this proportion, a greater or smaller number may be ordered, so as, if you would make an em∣buscadoe with 100 horse onely, 50 of them must be sent before towards the enemies camp, or village where he is quartered. Of these 50, 15 are to advance before the rest, to take some prisoners or horses: the other 35 shall be in am∣bush about half a league behinde them, in some place (if it be possible) whence they may see those 15: but if not, then to place 2 horse between themselves and those 15, to give notice when the said 15 shall return charged. Where∣upon 25 (of these 35) shall advance, leaving 10 of the best mounted at the place, to let the enemie see there is a greater
<PB N="93" REF="58"/> number of horse. These 10 must make good the retreat, untill the other 50 arrive which lay in ambush two leagues behinde, with Sentinels to discover afarre off towards the other 35, betwen which (about the midway) two horse were also placed to discover the motions of the first 50, and thereof to inform those 50 which were in ambush be∣hinde them. These seeing the first 50 return charged, shall let them passe, and then issue out against the enemie: the first 50 (making their retreat by 13 or 15 of their best mounted horse-men) having reunited themselves and taken breath, they must make<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">The word <HI>Alto,</HI> or <HI>Alte,</HI> is used in all lan∣guages in Christen∣dome, and signifieth to make a stand.

To this purpose some six horse may be left some league behinde the rest, a little out of the way but so as they may discover if the rest return charged, and then shew them∣selves at the end of the wood (as before is shewed) to make the enemie think there is a grosse embuscadoe, leaving one horse-man further within the wood then the rest, and he to give fire when the enemie may perceive or heare him, which the enemie may think was done by a mistake.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> Commander, marching with one or more troops, and chancing to meet the enemie, or otherwise having newes of him, must present∣ly resolve either to offer combat, or to retreat, or to attend the charge of the enemie: and herein he must govern himself according to the intelligence he hath, and the convenience of the<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Bonum Ducem convenit nôsse magnam partem vi∣ctoriae, ipsum locum, in quo dimicandum est, pos∣sidere. <HI>Veg. lib. 3. cap. 13.</HI></NOTE> place. To get the more certain intelligence, besides his scouts, he shall send out (a good distance before him) a Corporall with 10 or 12 souldiers, who (pretending to be of the enemie, if the coun∣trey be at the enemies devotion) shall discover and take in∣formation, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If you meet the enemie neare his own quarter, and farre from yours, you must resolve with a generous courage to go and<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">In rebus asperis &amp; te∣nui spe, fortissima quaque confilia tutissima sunt. <HI>Livius, lib. 35.</HI></NOTE> charge him, though inferiour in number; it being often seen that valiant resolutions are seconded with good luck. But being neare to your own holds, and knowing the enemie to be much stronger then your self, it will be prudently done to<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Observandum autem est, baud par esse, sine magna necessitate, ut pau∣ca copiae cum magno &amp; instructo exercitu dimi∣cent. <HI>Leo Tact. cap. 12. 36.</HI></NOTE> save your men by the nearest retreat: making your retreat in good order, and taking heed you spoile not your horses by too much haste, but suffer them now and then to gather breath, leaving a Lieutenant in the reare with some of the best mounted souldiers. The retreat shall be by the same way you went, so long as day continues; but night being come, you must take some other way (though the longer) to return to your garrison, or quarter. Thus you shall gain time by turning away from the enemie by the benefite of the night; causing the footing of your horses to be defaced at the place where you left the way, for it is to be supposed the enemie will follow you by the direct way. To deface or put out the footing of the horse, if the way be dustie, two souldiers are appointed to stay behinde all the rest, which draw a great bough betwen them along the ground, and so put out the marks of the horses footing. Or if there be a great number of horse, and the way be
<PB N="95" REF="59" MS="y"/> broad, then foure souldiers with two boughs do it. But if the way be soft, the Chief commandeth five or six souldi∣ers to alight, and with their hands and feet to deface the footings; and in such wayes the horse are commanded to march with doubled files and closed, for a little space when they turn out of the usuall way, that so they may trample the lesse. Besides, you may avoid the danger of being traced by the horse footings (especially in the night) by turning out of the way at some house, or through some garden, breaking the hedge on the further side, and going into the way by wayes unthought off: by all which means you gain time, whilest the enemie is constrained to spend time in discover∣ing of your footing, and taking informatiom of the way that you took.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of ordering the troops for combat, by single companies.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Efore we come to shew the severall forms of battell which may be used among the Cavall∣rie, it will be fit to speak of their severall kindes of fighting, which they are to be practised in apart by themselves, before they be joyned with the grosse.</P>
<P>If a companie of Lances were to fight against foot, they were not to give their charge in an united bodie (neither upon this, nor any occasion whatsoever) because even the second rank of them hardly doth any certain execution; but they were to charge them rank after rank, wheeling off to the reare; to that end keeping large distances between rank and rank. The same order they were to observe, if they fought against horse upon the offensive. For the defensive, the companie (consisting of 64, as before, <HI>Part.</HI> 1. <HI>Chap.</HI> 19.) might order themselves in this manner. Two ranks (of 8 in rank) should face to the front: two to either flank, and two to the reare; leaving an open square space in the middle, they all standing back towards back, faced every way, to re∣ceive the charge wheresoever the enemie shall give on.</P>
<P>The same manner might be used in greater bodies, as should seem good to the skilfull Commander. If the Lances were to fight against Cuirassiers,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Par. 3. rangs de lances lui aller gail∣lardement donner par les flancs: car par ce moyen ils l'entr' ouuriront. <HI>Monsieur de la Noüe. Disc.</HI> 18.</NOTE> they were (by two ranks together) to fetch their careers, and so to charge them, espe∣cially on the flanks and reare: every second rank forbearing the shock, till the first had done it, and was wheeled off.</P>
<P>If one companie of Cuirassiers be to fight against ano∣ther, your enemie charging you in full career, you are to make a<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">So <HI>Walhausen</HI> would have it.</NOTE> Carracoll, that is, you divide your body by the half ranks, and so suddenly open to the right and left; so as the enemie passeth through you, and you (facing inward) charge him on the flanks, as is shewed in <HI>Fig.</HI> 6. <HI>Part.</HI> 4.

But others do utterly reject it, as too much expo∣sed to inevitable danger. In their firing by ranks, the first rank advanceth some 30 paces before the bodie, first on the gallop, then in career (as some direct) and so to give fire: the second doth the same, and so the rest.

<P>But if the said Infanterie be put in good order at his ap∣proach, (if the ground be champain, and the number equall) yet may they be charged by the horse: First by some troops of Harquebusiers (or rather Dragons, because they do execu∣tion at a larger distance) which shall give on on their front, flanks, and reare. These were to be seconded by the Lan∣ces (in small divisions) when they were in use; but now by the Cuirassiers, who shall make their benefit of such over∣tures or disorders as shall be caused by the said Dragons and Harquebusiers.</P>
<P>If the Infanterie exceed in number, and so be serried in a grosse body, it will be hard for the Cavallrie to rout them, as hath been found by experience by the Swisses, which still had the better of the horse, by reason of their grosse bodies of pikes.</P>
<P>If the Infanterie be ordered into severall battallions, the horse are to charge them where they perceive them most open and naked. But if the foot have possessed themselves of some place of advantage, as some wood, trench, or covert way, then the horse are not to charge them, though equall, or somewhat superiour to them in number, in respect of such advantage.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Of ordering the Cavallrie in battell.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He forms of battell used among the horse (pre∣supposing such as are made by election, in a free and spacious champain, and not such as are forced through discommoditie of place, or other respects)<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Ʋna aciei bellicae for∣ma non est, sed muitae &amp; diversae, pro varietate ar∣morum, militum, hostium, locorum, temporum. <HI>Leo Tact. cap. 20. 182.</HI></NOTE> are many;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ordinaturus acient, so∣lem &amp; ventum antè prospiciat. <HI>Veg. lib. 3. cap. 14.</HI></NOTE> and do varie according to the ground and strength both of your own side and the ene∣mies, accidents, and occasions. In all forms a principall care must be had, that the troops be drawn up from an even front, that so they may be free from disturbing each other in the retreat.</P>
<P><HI>Basta</HI> reduceth these forms to foure sorts, and <HI>Melzo</HI> to three, (making the second and third to be as one and the same) which are these:</P>
<P>The first is, when the troops are ordered as in one file, every troop following each other in a single order: which form is utterly disallowed, because it bringeth but few hands to fight, and the disordering of the first troop must needs endanger all the rest.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">The Grecians had their troops of re∣serve, and herein the Carthaginians imi∣tated them, and these the Romans also fol∣lowed. <HI>Veg. ibid. cap.</HI> 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>The second is, when all the troops are placed as in<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Si nimiùm fuerit acies attenuata, citò ab adver∣sariis factá impressione perrumpitur, &amp; nullum postea potest esse remedi∣um. <HI>Veg. lib. 3. cap. 16.</HI></NOTE> one rank, or one front; the one troop being placed on the flank of the other in a single order or straight line. Which form is also disapproved, because in it all the Cavallrie is engaged at once, the one not being able to succour the other, and having no troops of reserve.</P>
<P>The third is, when the troops are ordered chequer-wise, in squadrons, enterchangeably placed one behinde another: so as three or foure squadrons being in front, such distances are left between each, as others behinde them may come up to the front, without hindring the former.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg"><HI>Exercitus contractus &amp; quadratus, aut non ità multùm oblongus, ad omnem occasionem atque eventum firmus, utilis, atque tutus est.</HI> Leo Tact. cap. 9.34. The Grecians had three kindes of horse-battells; The Square, the Wedge, and the Rhombe (which is as the diamond battell.) The Square was held the best for the defen∣sive, the other two for the offensive. Of these the Wedge is prefer∣red, because it bringeth most hands to fight; the reare division of the Rhombe being of little use. <HI>Aelian. cap.</HI> 18.</NOTE> This form may well be allowed of, and is retained by the best Com∣manders in the present wars of Christendome: yet the fore∣named authors have this exception to it, because the Har∣quebusiers having taken up the said distances would hinder the Lances. (then in use) And if they should be drawn from those intervalles, and placed on the wings, they must be exposed to the first assaults of the enemie.</P>

<P>The fourth kinde of forma, they make the Lunarie, re∣sembling a half moon: but in this they differ from each other in the manner. That which they call single, must needs be weak, their double form is better. But both these last forms (the Checquer, and the Lunarie form) shall be more fully represented in figure.</P>
<P><HI>Walhausen</HI> maketh six sorts of battells: namely, 1. The Lu∣narie. 2. The Checquer. 3. The Broad-fronted. 4. The Em∣bowed. 5. The Sharp pointed. 6. The Divided.</P>
<P>The Lunarie (as he makes it, and the figure, <HI>Fig.</HI> 8. <HI>Part.</HI> 4. <HI>cap.</HI> 8. sheweth it) is good, and indeed better then that of <HI>Basta;</HI> but is improperly called the Lunarie form: for it is rather a Hollow, or Open-fronted wedge, like <HI>Aelians,</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">De instruend. acicb. <HI>cap. 36.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Coe∣lembolos.</HI></P>
<P>His Checquer is as the forementioned, and allowable.</P>
<P>His Broad-fronted is also not to be rejected.</P>
<P>His Embowed (which by the name should be a Convex halfmoon, like<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Which the Latine translation tearmeth <HI>Acies incurva;</HI> Aelian. cap. 47.</NOTE> <HI>Aelians Cyrte</HI>) he maketh a meere wedge. The form is not the worse, though the name be not so proper.</P>
<P>The Sharp pointed (in regard there is but one troop in front and that seconded but by two troops on the reare an∣gles; then but one troop again, seconded as the first) seemeth not to be so good as the former, because it bringeth few hands to fight, and is very subject to be<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Whereof <HI>Aelian</HI> sheweth the inconve∣niences, <HI>cap.</HI> 50.</NOTE> overwinged or overfronted by the enemie, and so to be charged on the flanks.</P>
<P>The Divided, especially at so large a distance, I hold to be dangerous. True it is, that here the Dragons are used as foot, but whether so single and so extended an order be the best for them to be placed in, I referre to the judicious.</P>
<P>Now concerning these six kindes of battells, they are in deed and in effect but two: that is, the Checquer and the Lunarie, as he calleth them; and from these grounds the rest be formed.</P>
<P>But these forms being onely imaginarie, and withall wanting that perfection (in many respects) which is requi∣red in reall battells, I shall now (to give fuller satisfaction to such as are lovers of militarie knowledge) communicate some forms of embattellings, which never yet were pub∣lished by any.</P>
<PB N="102" REF="67"/>
<P>These are true delineations of divers battells really or∣dered and performed by the absolutest Commanders of our times, according to the exactest rules of art; and such as experience hath approved to be fittest for the modern warres.</P>
<P>For the better understanding whereof, I have thought fit first to put down these directions following.</P>
<P>All the forces of the whole armie (both horse and foot) are usually distinguished and divided into<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">So did the Romanes; the Vanguard they called <HI>Cornu dextrum,</HI> the Battell <HI>Acies media,</HI> and the Reare <HI>Cornu si∣nistrum;</HI> as is shewed by S<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Cl. Edmonds,</HI> up∣on <HI>Caesars Com. lib.</HI> 1. <HI>cap.</HI> 7. <HI>Observ.</HI> 1. out of <HI>Lipsius de milit. Rom. lib.</HI> 4. and is handled at large by <HI>Leo</HI> the Em∣perour, <HI>Tact. cap.</HI> 18.</NOTE> three parts, name∣ly, the Vanguard, Battell, and Reare. (as hath been shewed Part. 2. chap. 3.) Each of which parts is governed by it's particular Officer or Chief; yet so as the absolute command belongeth to the Generall. These distinctions are alwayes so understood, in the order of marching, to avoid disputes about precedencie; so as they which march foremost are said to have the Vanguard, they which march in the middle, the Battell, and they which come last the Reare. And these divisions alter their names according to the place they march in, wherein they observe a diuinall change, as hath been shewed in the chapter above mentioned. But if we shall take the meaning of these words (according to their proprietie and usuall acceptation) in matter of fight or bat∣tell, conceiving that that part of the armie which is called the Vanguard shall give the first charge; and that which is called the Battell, shall give the second charge, &amp; the Reare∣ward, the last; it will prove a meere mistake. For we are to know that the first charge must be given by the first troop, or foremost order of companies which are in front placed as in one rank, extended from the one front-angle of the whole armie, to the other: and so it were impossible for them to be commanded or directed by one Commander, or Chief of one particular squadron of the armie, by reason of the large extent thereof: for we see that the front of the ar∣mie embattelled before <HI>Dornick. Fig.</HI> 14. (which was farre inferiour to that of late, employed at the siedge of the <HI>Bossch</HI>) took up<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Six foot make a fa∣thom, 100 fathoms a furlong, seven fur∣longs and a half, a mile. Five foot make a pace, 1000 paces make a mile.</NOTE> 6380 foot of ground (being in their close order prepared for fight) which is above a mile and a quar∣ter of our measure.</P>
<P>Besides, if the Vanguard (as it is called) should give the first charge, the Battell (which then must second them) may
<PB N="103" REF="67"/> chance to be of a nation not onely differing from the Van∣guard, but at variance with them, or else some grudge or dis∣gust between the Chiefs. And in that respect they might either neglect or slacken the seconding or relieving of those of the Vanguard, and not use that diligence which is re∣quired. In consideration therefore of these and other incon∣veniences, it is best that every squadron of the armie be so ordered, as each of them may have their first, second, and third troops: by which means every division shall both be commanded by their own Chiefs, and shall also be second∣ed by those of their own squadron, or division; which will give them the more courage and assurance. The manner therefore for the ordering of an armie for battell, is as fol∣loweth. That squadron which is called the Battell, is pla∣ced in the middle, the Vanguard on the right hand of it, and the Reare on the left: and all these (usually) in one front and single order; one regiment (or sometimes one compa∣nie, especially among the horse as in <HI>Fig.</HI> 10.) flanking the other, as in <HI>Fig.</HI> 12.</P>
<P>From hence the first troop of every division is drawn up, and placed in an even front or straight line, from one angle of the bodie to the other. At a convenient<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Usually 300 foot.</NOTE> distance behinde these, the second troop of every squadron is placed, in an even rank, as the former; but so as the<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">The Romanes also ordered their battells in three divisions, or troops: <HI>viz.</HI> their <HI>Ha∣stati, Principes,</HI> and <HI>Tri∣arii.</HI> The first were called <HI>Acies prima,</HI> and these were the <HI>Hasta∣ti</HI> which were to give the first charge. At a distance behinde them were the <HI>Principes</HI> placed, which were called <HI>Acies secunda:</HI> these were so ordered with spaces or inter∣valles, that the <HI>Hasta∣ti</HI> (being put to re∣treat) might fall back into these spaces, and the <HI>Principes</HI> might advance to give the second charge with∣out disturbing each other. The third troop <HI>(Acies tertia)</HI> were the <HI>Triarii,</HI> which were placed behinde the <HI>Principes,</HI> obser∣ving therein such in∣tervalles as before mentioned. <HI>Vide Livi∣um lib.</HI> 8. <HI>&amp; Lipsium de milit. Rom. lib.</HI> 4. <HI>ubi etiam Aciei Iconismus.</HI></NOTE> first troop (which are to give the first charge) being to retreat, and this second troop to advance, they disturb not each other: for which reason, convenient spaces are left in the first order or troop, for the second to come up into. The third troop is placed just behinde the first, but at twice as large a<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">600 foot.</NOTE> distance from the second, as the second is from the first: that so the first troop retreating behinde the second, they may have convenient room to make their retreat in good order. All this will appeare in the figures following, among the rest in <HI>Fig.</HI> 9.</P>
<P>If the Infanterie and Cavallrie be joyned together, the manner is to place half the horse on the right flank of the foot, and the other half on the left, as appeareth in <HI>Fig.</HI> 12, 14, and 15. But upon occasion either of the enemie his ordering of horse within the bodie of foot, whereby he might annoy your Infanterie; or for other respects of mo∣ment,
<PB N="104" REF="68"/> some of the horse may be placed within the bodie of the armie, as is shewed in <HI>Fig.</HI> 16.</P>
<P>What distances be observable, between Regiment and Regiment, between Squadron and Squadron, betwen each Troop, the second from the first, and the third from the second, the figures will sufficiently shew, and especi∣ally the Scales of measure in every figure. For the more easie understanding of them, observe that every bodie of pikes is single hatched, thus <GAP DESC="symbol" RESP="oxf"/> and the musketiers crosse-hatched, thus <GAP DESC="symbol" RESP="oxf"/>. the horse are left white or void, as in <HI>Fig.</HI> 12. by which the other forms may easily be under∣stood.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of certain ceremonies before fight.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>Aving shewed by these former rules and ex∣amples, how the horse are to be ordered for fight, not onely by themselves, but also when they shall be joyned with foot: that which<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Quid superest nifi pugna? quae jam manu∣um est, non verberum. <HI>Lips. de milit. Rom. lib. 4.</HI></NOTE> now remaineth seemeth rather to require action then words. Indeed with antiquitie, when the ar∣mie was embattelled and readie for combat, it was usuall for the Generall to deliver some set speech, either from some higher place of turf or stone, or at the head of the troops; and riding amongst the Maniples to encourage his souldi∣ers. And they either with an acclamation, lifting up of their hands, or clashing of their arms, used to manifest their as∣senting resolution. Unto which kinde of<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Caesars</HI> armie, being so dismaid through feare as they were al∣most brought to de∣speration, <HI>(tantus subi∣tò timor omnem exerci∣tum occupavit, &amp;c.)</HI> was by an elegant oration of his suddenly revi∣ved. <HI>Hac oratione ha∣bitâ mirum in modum conversae sunt omnium mentes, summáque ala∣critas &amp; cupiditas belli gererdi iunata est.</HI> Cae∣sar de bello Gal. lib. 1. cap 9.</NOTE> allocutions the ancient Sages use to ascribe a marvellous efficacie, not onely amongst the Grecians or Romanes, but also those whom they then accounted barbarous, as the Britons, Gaules, Ger∣mans &amp;c. as the histories of those times sufficiently testifie. Next to this, they sounded the <HI>Classicum</HI> (that is) a generall charge; and this was seconded by a generall shout of the souldiers, or a concussion of their arms. Moreover, a<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg"><HI>Tunicarussa, punicea, vel caccinea.</HI> Some re∣semblance hereof there is in the bloody flagge at sea.</NOTE> scar∣let, red, or carnation coloured coat or cassock was hung out upon the top of the Generalls tent: and a countersigne, or a word of distinction was given to the souldiers, as,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Veg. lib. <HI>3.</HI> cap. <HI>5.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Victoria, palma, virtus,</HI> or the like, to know each other by. The Greci∣ans used also to sing the <HI>Poean,</HI> before the fight to <HI>Mars,</HI> and after battell to <HI>Apollo,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Of all which ceremonies (which they duly observed as found to be of very good use, and which were much graced by the solemne and stately manner of performing them) our times have retained very few. For as the actions of the modern warres consist chiefly in sieges, assaults, sal∣lies, skirmishes, &amp;c. and so affoard but few set battells; so the practise of delivering publike speeches is almost grown out of use and esteem amongst our chief Commanders. Yet the late<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Meteren. lib. <HI>12.</HI> J. Petit. lib. <HI>15.</HI></NOTE> Prince of Orange at the battell of <HI>Newport</HI>
<PB N="106" REF="78"/> before the conflict, delivered a pithie short speech to his souldiers: adding to his publike Oratorie, publike Orisons, and riding up and down, gave courage to his souldiers. The <HI>Classicum</HI> is still retained (that is) to sound a generall charge, namely amongst those troops which are to give on. And sometimes the <HI>Clamor militaris,</HI> or shout of the souldiers; which was not onely an acclamation or assent unto the Generalls speech, but also a<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">This by the Greci∣ans was called <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and by the La∣tines <HI>Barritus</HI> (the ori∣ginall of which words is shewed by <HI>Lips. ubi supra</HI>) yet afterwards when the Empire was become Christian, they used (when they were readie for con∣flict) to crie <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, (that is) the victorie of the crosse: as appeareth by <HI>Leo</HI> the Emperour (who reigned in the East from the yeare of our Lord 886 to 903) Tact. cap. 12 69. <HI>Cùm ad conflictatio∣nem movet exercitus, consueta Christianis vox usurpanda est,</HI> <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. And after this, in the very charge, they were to make their shout, as it followeth there 106. <HI>Conflictationis tem∣pore post vocem,</HI> Victo∣riae crucis, <HI>magna atqui altos clamores edere opor∣tet, &amp;c.</HI></NOTE> loud and dreadfull kinde of noise which they used to make when they gave the charge, thereby to encourage one another, and to strike a terrour into the enemies: as the Turks crie, <HI>Bre, Bre, Bre;</HI> the Irish, <HI>Pharro, Pharro;</HI> the French, <HI>Sa, Sa, Sa;</HI> the Dutch, <HI>Vallaen, Vallaen,</HI> &amp;c. But as for the countersigne or word of distin∣ction, that is seldome used now adayes, unlesse upon occa∣sion of some <HI>Camisado,</HI> or other exploits in the night, when the souldiers may easilie misse those means to know each other by, which in the day time the light, the sight of the ensigne or cornet, their skarfs (required among the Cavall∣rie) or long acquaintance, may afford them.</P>
<P>But these being but ceremonies (as I called them in the title of this chapter) I willingly withdraw my self from them. Neither should I have been desirous to have meddled with them at all, but that the example of others<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Lips. de milit. Rom. Reusnerus de arte strata∣gem.</NOTE> (who have writ in this kinde) led me unto it; and the respect un∣to my reader (in common civilitie) required it at my hands; whom I could not well leave (after the sight of so many dumbe figures) without a word or two at the parting.</P>
<P>There remaineth onely now, that every one (according to his office, rank, and abilitie) strive for honour and victo∣rie; propounding to himself the goodnesse of the cause, the authoritie of the Prince, the command of the Leaders, the vertue of the souldiers, the honour of the conquest, and the disgrace and damage of the defeat. Above all, lifting up his eies and heart unto Almightie God, from whose hands victorie, and the means to obtain it, is especially to be expected.<NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Psalm. 18. vers. 32, 34.</NOTE> <HI>It is God that girdeth me with strength of warre, and maketh my way perfect.

<P>THus have I breifly (according to my weak abilitie) runne through that part of the Art militarie, which principally concerneth the Cavallrie: Which subject I have the rather chosen to treat of, because it is so little and so sparingly handled by those that have given us dire∣ctions for warre, and lesse observed in our ordinarie practise,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Witnesse those fre∣quent and sharp repre∣hensions, expressed in his Majesties letters, from time to time: a∣mong others, <HI>that of the</HI> 21 <HI>of September.</HI> 1628, from <HI>Windsor.</HI> And the continuall &amp; serious callings upon for reformation, by the letter, from the Lords of his Majesties most honourable pri∣vie counsell, and the right honourable the Lords Lieutenants of every county.</NOTE> especially in the exercise of our trained troops here at home. Wherein yet I do not presume to have attained un∣to that maturitie which is required for the perfect know∣ledge and instruction of it; much lesse do I take upon my self to teach others (as I doubt not but there are many thou∣sands that are a great deale better able then my self) but one∣ly in hope that these my collections may serve either as a manuduction to those, that are desirous to be instructed in the first rudiments or confused knowledge of this Art: or else as an occasion to the judicious Masters of it, friendly &amp; favorably to correct or supply what they shall finde here to be amisse, or wanting. For my self, I shall account it a sufficient reward of my poore endeavours, if by my untunable jangling I may chance to towle and call in better ringers. But it is too late now (and at all times least of all expected in this kinde of subject) to labour for apologies, or with Rheto∣ricall colours to varnish or dawbe over the wants and imperfections of this discourse.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">2. Maccab. cap. 15. vers. 38.</NOTE> <HI>If I have done well, and as the matter required, it is that which I desired: but if slender∣ly and meanly, it is that which I could attain unto.</HI></P>
