<P>SINCE my last, it's said, The Drum that came to the General, was an Answer to a Message, sent by the General, about Exchange of Priso∣ners on the <HI>24th.</HI> This Morning about the Hour of Six, the Drum returned from the Enemies Quarters; all our Hands (that can any ways possibly be spared from other Du∣ty,) are mending the Tin Boats; and our Men are working, with all diligence, in raising of three New Batteries, one below the Bridge, another above it; and the third without the Town-Wall, by the River-side, opposite to a large Bastion, the Enemy have erected, on the other side the River <HI>Shannon,</HI> which is there not so broad as the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> between <HI>Westminster Horse Ferry,</HI> and <HI>Lambeth</HI> at Low-Water.</P>
<P>About Seaven of the Clock this Evening, one of the Granadeers belonging to the Lord <HI>Lisburn</HI>'s Regiment going under some Arches of the Bridge of <HI>Athlone,</HI> to look for Plunder amongst the Enemies Dead, found a pair of Colours, belonging to a Company of the Earl of <HI>Clanrickard</HI>'s Regiment; which were
<PB REF="2" MS="y"/>on the Breach when we Stormed the Town, and brought them off flying to the General; and though, I believe, 100 Shot were made at him, yet none hurt him: The Lord Ba∣ron <HI>Ginkle,</HI> our General, very generously Rewarded him with Five Guineas. The <HI>25th.</HI> yesterday the Enemy were very hard at work, in raising two new Batteries above the Castle; the one close by the River side, the other on a rising ground, a distance from it; and about Eight of the Clock last Night they were finished, one of them are of four, the other of three, six Pounders, with the latter of which, they have played briskly on the old Walls of the Town, where our Men are, (but without killing, or wound∣ing any;) with the other, they shot into some of our Regiments, who lay Encamp'd on the Bank of the River, which obliged our Men to Decamp, and remove farther off.</P>
<P>About this Morning, our Battery (below the Bridge) was finished, and 26 four Pound∣ers planted thereon, which has ever since Six this Morning, played incessantly on the Enemies Breast-work, on the other side, by which, most of the said Breast-work is beat down and levelled with the ground; as also, most of the Houses that stood on the other side the Town; by which means, the Ene∣mies Works are so much exposed to our view, that they are forced to quit the Town, a great part or them retiring to <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 chunk" DISP="…"/></HI>'s Camp, others retiring behind the Castle, and in the Work over the Bridge, which in a few hours, from our upper Battery, will be soon likewise ruined, and it's not doubt∣ed, but that very soon we may acquaint you, that we are Masters of the River, and Ruined Town of <HI>Athlone:</HI> Our Guns are now firing very furiously from all our Bat∣teries, with very good success.</P>

<P>Yesterday our Guns and Mortars played incessantly against the Enemies Works, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Tin-Boats are all mended, and all things in a readiness to attempt our Passage over the River <HI>Shan∣non,</HI> &amp;c. which will be at three several pla∣ces, both above, and below the <HI>Bridge of Athlone;</HI> and I am certainly informed, that to Morrow will be the Day. A Deserter that came into our Camp this Morning, says The Enemies Army hourly expects our going over the <HI>Shannon.</HI></P>
