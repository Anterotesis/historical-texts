<P>¶Afore that I wyll speke of Brute / it shall be shewed howe the londe of Eng∣londe was fyrst named Albyon / and by what encheson it was so named.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>OF the noble londe of Sirrie / there was a ryal kynge &amp; myghty &amp; a man of grete renowne / that was called Dyoclesyā that wel &amp; worthely hym gouerned &amp; ruled thrugh hys noble cheualry. Soo that he conquered all the londes aboute hym / so that almoost al the kyn¦ges of y<SUP>e</SUP> worlde to hym were attendaūt. ¶It befell thus that this Dyoclesyā spowsed a gen¦tyl damoysell that was wōder fayre / that was his vncles doughter Labana. &amp; she loued hym as reason wolde / so that he gate vpō her .xxxiii daughters / of the whiche y<SUP>e</SUP> eldest was called. A bine. And these damoyselles whā they came vnto aege became so fayre that it was wonder wherof Dyoclesyan anone lete make a somo∣nynge / &amp; cōmaunded by his letters that all y<SUP>e</SUP> kynges that helde of hym sholde come at a cer¦tayne daye / as in his letters were conteyned to make a feest ryall. At whiche daye thyther they came / &amp; brought with theym Admyralles prynces and dukes / and noble chyualry. The feest was ryally arayed / and there they lyued in Ioye &amp; myrth ynough / that it was wonder to wyte. And it befell thus / that Dyoclesyan thought to mary his doughters amonge al tho kynges that were at that solempnyte. ¶And so they spake &amp; dyd / that Albine his eldest dou¦ghter &amp; al her systers rychely were maryed vn¦to xxxiii. kynges / that were lordes of grete ho¦nour &amp; of power at this solempnyte. And whā the solempnyte was doone / euery kynge toke his wyfe &amp; ladde them in to theyr owne coūtre &amp; there made them quenes. And it befell thus afterwarde that this dame Albine became so stoute &amp; so sterne / that she tolde lytell pryce of her lorde / and of hym had scorne &amp; dyspyte &amp; wolde not do his wyll / but she wolde haue her owne wyl in dyuers maters. And al her other systers euery chone bare them so euyl agaynst theyr lordes that it was wonder to wyte. And for as moche that thē thought that theyr hus∣bondes were not of so hyghe parentage come as theyr <ABBR>fad</ABBR> But those kyng{is} that were theyr lordes / wolde haue chastysen them with fayre manere vpō al loue &amp; frendshyp that they shol¦de amende theyr selfwylled condycyons. But all was for noughte / for they dyd theyr owne wyl in al thynge that thē lyked. &amp; had of pow∣er. wherfore those .xxxiii. kynges vpon a tyme and ofte tymes bete theyr wyues.

Wherfore the kynge that had wedded Albine wrote the tatches and condy∣cyons of his wyfe Albine / and sente the lettre to Dyoclesyan his fader. And whan the other kynges herde that Albines lorde hadde sente a lettre to Dyoclesyan. anone they sente letters sealed with theyr seales the condycyons &amp; tat∣ches of theyr wyues. whan the kynge Dyocle∣syan sawe &amp; herde so many playntes of his dou¦ghters. He was sore ashamed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> &amp; became won∣der angry and wrothe towarde his doughters and thought. howe he then̄e myght amende it that they so mysdyde. And anone sente his let∣ters vnto the .xxxiii. kynges that they sholde co¦me to hym: &amp; brynge with theym theyr wyues euerychone at a certayne daye. For he wolde there chastyse theym of theyr wyckednesse / yf he myght in ony maner wyse. So the kynges came all at that tyme &amp; day that then was set∣te bytwene hym and the kynges. Dyoclesyan receyued them with moche honoure / and ma∣de a solempne feest to all that were vnderneth his lordshyp. And the thyrde day after that so¦lempnyte / the kynge Dyoclesyan sente after his .xxxiii. doughters that they sholde come &amp; speke with hym in his chābre. And whan they were come / he spake to them of theyr wycked∣nes &amp; of theyr cruelte and spytefully them re∣preued &amp; blamed / &amp; to them he sayde. That yf they wolde not be chastysed / they sholde his lo¦ue lose for euermore. And whan the ladyes her¦de al this / they became abasshed &amp; gretly asha¦med.

And anone all the ladyes consented and graunted to this coun∣sell. And whan nyght was comen / the lordes and ladyes went to bedde / And anone as theyr lordes were a slepe / they kette all theyr husbō∣des throtes / and so they slewe them all. whan that Dyoclesyan theyr fader herd of this thin∣ge / he became furyously wrothe agaynste hys doughters / And anone wolde them alle haue brente. But all the barons and lordes of Sir∣rie coūseyled not so for to do suche streytnesse to his owne doughters / but only sholde voyde the londe of them for euer more so that they ne¦uer sholde come ayen / and so he dyde. And Dy¦oclesyan that was theyr fader anone cōmaun¦ded them to go in to a shyppe / &amp; deliuered to thē vytaylles for half a yere· And whan this was done / all the systers went in to the shyppe and saylled forthe in the see / &amp; betoke all theyr fren¦des to Apolin that was theyr god. And so long they saylled in the see / tyll at the last they came and arryued in an yle / that was all wyldernes¦se. And whan dame Albion was come to that londe &amp; all her systers. This Albyne went fyr∣ste forth out of the shyppe / &amp; sayd to her other systers. For as moche sayde she as I am the el¦dest syster of all this company / &amp; fyrst this lon¦de hathe taken / and for as moche as myn na∣me is Albine.

<HEAD>¶Of the meruaylles and wōders of Irlonde. ca. xxviii.</HEAD>
<P>MAny men tellen that in the northe syde of Irlonde is the londe of lyfe. In that ylonde no man maye deye but whan they ben olde and vexed wyth greate sykenes / they ben borne out in to the nexte londe and deye there. There is an other ylonde in Irlonde that noo womman ther in may bere a childe / but yet she may conceyue. Also there is an ylonde in why¦che no dede body maye roten. In vltonia that is Vlstre is an ylonde in a lake wōderly depar¦ted in twene In that one parte is grete dystur¦baunce and dyscomforth of frendes &amp; in that other partye grete lykyng and comforth of ho¦ly angels There is also saynt Patryks purga¦tory that was shewed at hys prayer to confer∣me hys prechynge &amp; hys lore whan he preched to mysbyleued men of sorowe and payne that euyll mē sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> suffre for ther euyll werkes. And of Ioye and of blysse y<SUP>e</SUP> gode men shall receyue for ther holy dedes he telleth that who that suf∣freth the paynes of purgatory / yf it be enioy∣ned hym for penaunce he shall neuer suffre the paynes of hell / but he deye fynally withon re∣pentaunce of synne / as the ensample. is sette more full at this chapytre ende. ¶Treuisa. But truly noman maye be saued but yf he be very repentaunce what someuer penaunce he do / and euery man that is very repentaunt as hys lyues ende shall be sekerly saued / though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he neuer here of saynt Patryks purgatorye.

There is an ylond in cona<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te Sale / that is in y<SUP>e</SUP> see of Conaccia halowed by saynt Brandon y<SUP>t</SUP> hath no myse there dede bodyes ben not buryed but bē kept out of the erth &amp; roten not. In Ma¦monia is a wel who y<SUP>t</SUP> wassheth hym with that water of y<SUP>e</SUP> welle he shall waxe / hore on his heed There is an other wel in Vltonia who someuer is wasshē therin he shall neuer wexe hore after warde / There is a welle in Mounstre or Ma¦monia \ yf ony mā touche that welle anone shal falle grete rayne in alle the prouȳce / &amp; that ray¦ne shalle neuer cesse / tyll a preste that is a clene mayden synge a masse in a chapell that is faste by &amp; blesse the water / &amp; wyth mylke of a cowe y<SUP>t</SUP> is of one her besprynge the welle. &amp; so reconcyle the welle in this staunge manere. At Glyndal can aboute the oratory of Saynt Keywyn wy¦ches beryth apples as it were apple trees and ben moore holsome than sauery. That holy sa¦ynt brought forthe these apples by prayers for to hele his shylde that was seke. There is a la∣ke in Vlstre and moche fysshe therin / whyche is .xxx. myle in lengthe and. in brede. The Ry∣uer Ban renneth out of that lake into the nor¦the Occean and mē saye that thys lake began̄e in this manere. There were men in that coun¦tree that were of euyll lyuynge coeuntes cūbru∣tis. And there was a well in that londe in gre¦te reuerence of olde tyme / And all waye coue∣red / yf it were lefte vncouered the welle wolde ryse and drowned all the londe. And soo it hap¦ped that a wooman wente to that welle for to fetche water &amp; hyed her fast to her chyld y<SUP>t</SUP> wept in the cradell / &amp; left the welle vncouered / then the welle sprange soo faste that is drowned the woman and her chylde &amp; made all the countree a lake and a fysshe ponde. for to preue that thys is soo there it is greate argument / that whan the weder is clere / fysshers of that water see in the rounde vnder the water rounde toures and hyghe shapen as steples and chyrches of that londe. In the north syde of Irlonde in the coun¦tre of Ossyyryens euery .vii. yere at the prayer of an hooly Abbot / tweyne that ben wedded a man and a woman muste nedes be exyled and forshapen in to lyknes of wolues &amp; abyde out .vii. yere. And atte ende of .vii. yere. yf they ly∣ue they come home agayne / And take agayne theyr owne shappe / And than shall other twey¦ne goo forthe in theyr stede and soo forshapen for other .vii. yere. There is a lake in thys lon¦de yf a poole of tree pyghte and stycked therin that parte of the shafte or poole. That is in the erth shall torne in to yron / And that par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that abydeth in the water shalle torne into stone / And the parte that abydeth aboue shall be tree in his owne kynde. Also there is a lake that tor¦nethe hasell in to asshe and asshe in to hasell yf it be done therin. Also in Irlonde ben thre Sa¦mon lepes there as samons lepe ayenste a Ro∣che of longe speres lenthe. Also in Leginia is a pounde there ben seen colmans byrdes. The berdes been called certelles and come homely to mannes honde but yf men do hym wronge or harme. They gone a waye and come notte a¦gayne / and the water there shall be bytter and stynke / and he that dyde the wronge shall not a stert wythoute wretche and myschyef but yf he do amendes. ¶R. As touchynge Patryks purgatorye. ye shalle vnderstonde Saynt Pa¦tyrk that was abbote and not byshoppe why∣le he prechyd in Irlonde laboured and studyed for to torne thylke wycked men that lyued as beestes oute other euyll lyf for drede of paynes of helle / and for to conferme hem to good lyfe and they sayde they wolde not torne but some of theim myghte knowe som what of the grete paynes and also of the blesse that he spake of.
