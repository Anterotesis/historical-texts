<P>I Thank you for your Letter, and am heartily glad to hear of the present re∣crvits for Ireland. For newes here, take it briefly thus, the Kord Lieutenant of Ire∣land did send five hundred foote, and three hundred horse to go to Wexford, and the Lord Inchiquin hearing of them, sent fir Thomas Armstrong with eight hun∣dred horse, and two thousand foot, to fall upon them, saying, they should not need to fight much with them, for they should find them lye dead under every hedge, but it pleased God, miraculously to deliver these poor men, for the Enemy <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alling on, it pleased God to strengthen these poore
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>distressed creatures. that they routed the Enemy, killed about 30, and took neer 60, with very little loss on our fide, thus you see the great mercy of God to us, and J doubt not, but in a short time, the Lord will finish his great work in that nation. So J rest,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>COllonel Pride is here, and hath three parties of foot coming hither to be trans∣ported for Ireland, and I believe they will be about a thousand men, and then these with three companies of Colonell Moors, and three com∣panies of colonel Fenwicks, wil make a consi∣derable body: Captain Clarke, captain of the swan frigot that went convoy for Derry, is come back and put into Heland, and writes me
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>thence some relation he hath heard from scot∣land, that eight great ships should be arrived there, and that colonell King, collonel Iohnson. others are landed, and sixty sail of ships with souldiers, of all which I believe little or no part of it; for I have a Nephew that went over with captain Clark to London-Derry, who sent me a letter, wherein he writes not one word of it. This is all I will trouble you at present.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SInce my last, I received Letters, confir∣ming for certain Corke and youghall have declared for the Parliament of England, and they hope the most part of Munster will be gained without shedding of bloud.</P>
<P>I hope your distractions are at a period, and if so, I doubt not but by the blessing of God, in
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>ear longer the adversaries boasting spirits will be quieted. We are now treating with Waterford, and in a short time I hope to give you a good account of it: many of our Officers are dead. That arch sea Pirate, captain Plun∣ket was taken, with two prizes, but himself e∣scaped in a long boat, his ship had thirty six piece of Ordnance, and came into our harbour before he was aware, three prises more were ta∣ken in the River near Duncannon, before we withdraw our Army thence.</P>
