<HEAD>THE PRESENT STATE OF Jamaica.</HEAD>
<P>THE Island of <HI>Jamaica</HI> in <HI>America</HI> is Situated in about 182 North Latitude, in the Sea called <HI>Mare Del Nort;</HI> it lies about 140 Leagues North of the Main Continent of <HI>America,</HI> South from the great Island of <HI>Cuba</HI> about 15 Leagues, and from <HI>Hispaniola</HI> West about 20 Leagues.</P>
<P>The Island is of an Oval Form, and lies due East and West, having a continued Ridge of lofty Moun∣tains
<PB N="2" REF="7"/> running from one end to the other. By the Map and Survey which Sir <HI>Thomas Lynch</HI> took, it's above 150 Miles long, and from 25 to 50 Miles broad, <HI>de plano,</HI> and contains four Millions and a half of Acres; it's imagined, if this Island were divided into eight parts, one is Excellent Pasturage, called by the <HI>Indians Savannas,</HI> 4/8 good Plantable Land, ⅜ Barren or unplantable.</P>
<P>In the Year 1675, when Sir <HI>Tho∣mas Lynch</HI> left the Government, there was above 900000 Acres pass'd and Planted, and to Manure and Culti∣vate it about 30000 of all sorts of People.</P>
<P>This Island is not generally so Fer∣tile and proper for Sugar as <HI>Barba∣does</HI> has been, the Soyl being ex∣treamly differing; for in some parts 'tis a black fat Earth, and in others stiff and Clayie, in others Sandy, and in some Reddish, but by pareels; it's therefore the Settlements are di∣stinct,
<PB N="3" REF="7"/> Mountainous, and Unplant∣able Land interposing betwixt them make them appear like so many se∣veral Colonies, and has occasioned this Division of the Parishes, St. <HI>Thomas</HI> at the East, St. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> at the West, St. <HI>Johns</HI> and St. <HI>Thomas in the Vale.</HI> In the Island, St. <HI>Georges,</HI> St. <HI>Maries,</HI> and St. <HI>Anns,</HI> the North side: St. <HI>Davids,</HI> St. <HI>Andrews, Port Royal,</HI> St. <HI>Catharines,</HI> St. <HI>Dorothies, Clarendon</HI> and <HI>Vere</HI> on the South side. The greatest Plains, and almost all the <HI>Savannas</HI> or Pasturage is on the South side; they are all taken up and Stock'd with Cattel; on the South side likewise is <HI>Port Royal</HI> and all the best Ports and Roads, and most considerable Plantations, this side being dry, plain, more agreeable, and much quicker and safer Coast than the North, for that in the Spring is apt to violent Gusts of Winds, and much more subject to Rains than the South, as the East,
<PB N="4" REF="8"/> and all Parts is that is Woody and Mountainous; nor has the North side any safe Port, but <HI>Port Antonio,</HI> to the Wind-ward, which is subject to violent and constant Rains, and the Land about it Morsey and Moun∣tainous, so no Settlements are near it. The other Lee-ward Parishes have <HI>Port St. Maries,</HI> that is Reaso∣nably good and safe, but they have (especially in St. <HI>Maries</HI> Parish) abundance of Excellent Plantations of <HI>Coccoa,</HI> many Sugar-works, and Provision Plantations that are sup∣ported and carried on by Hunting and gathering <HI>Pimento,</HI> with which this Quarter abounds. Thus Plan∣tations were begun, and the Govern∣ment settled in Sir <HI>Thomas Lynch</HI> his time, and now the Inhabitants find the goodness of that Soyl Liberally Recompence the want of Harbours and Pasturage, and distance from the Chief Port and Seat of Govern¦ment, for its very Fertile Land
<PB N="5" REF="8"/> covered with Excellent Timber; it's a little Hilly, but full of fine Rivers, and all Conveniencies for Plantations.</P>
<P>The Climate is as agreeable as any can be betwixt the Tropicks, the Air being very serene and clear, even to a Proverb among the <HI>Spaniards:</HI> It's subject to Thunder and Light∣ning, as all Countries in that Lati∣tude are; the Rains come uncer∣tainly, but most expected about <HI>November</HI> and <HI>May,</HI> they are gene∣rally violent, continue an uncertain time, are unhealthy, and breed <HI>Mus∣ketoes,</HI> that are the greatest Plague in the Island, but are troublesom only the Rainy Seasons, and in most places where they have not good Houses, a free Air, clean Yards, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This Climate subjects no body inevitably to Diseases, here being no such thing as Seasoning, which is common in <HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>Virginia, &amp;c.</HI> Sir <HI>Tho. Lynch</HI> at St. <HI>Jago</HI> and
<PB N="6" REF="9"/> thereabouts lost not one Person o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Family that consisted of abou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Thirty all the time of his Govern∣ment. But to many Persons the Heat is unsupportable, because it's so constant, and its Reflections so violent, otherwise it is not greate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than our Summers in <HI>England.</HI> I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is Excess in Eating, Drinking, Exer¦cising Debauchery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that to new comers and full Bodies often bring Fevers, Calentures, and such Dis¦eases, that are infinitely more Acut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than those here, and Cured by othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Methods. To Servants, poor La¦bouring People, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Dropsie i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the most common of all other Dis¦eases; they and Debauch'd Person are the most subject to Belly-aches caused usually by their Disorders want of convenient Lodging, Cloath¦ing, Exercise, Diet, but sometime by ill chosen Seats when they Plan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in low Valleys, and have no Air, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by Rivers, and have too much moi¦sture,
<PB N="7" REF="9"/> or by Mountains or Morossos, and have too much Rain, or by the Sea-side and on Bays, where they are Sandy, want good Water, and have the Reflection of the Sun too vio∣lent; for this Island differs one part from another as much in the temper of the Climate, as nature of the Soyl: For the East Parts are Moun∣tainous, Rainy, and generally Fer∣tile and unhealthful. The South Part dry, plain, very pleasant, abound∣ing with Ports and Pasturage. The West is between both, only that and the South want Rivers, which the North side abounds with, and Rich Land, as likewise good Hunt∣ing and gathering <HI>Pimento</HI> in the Mountains, and Fishing on the Sea-Coasts; and by what the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have told us, and some little Disco∣very we have made, we think di∣vers of the Mountains have Mine∣rals.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
<P>The Winter Months here have only the Nights, Mornings and Eve∣nings cooler, the Days as hot as Summer, and about fifteen Hours long Winter and Summer.</P>
<P>The Winds blow not an hours variation commonly here as they do every where betwixt the Tro∣picks, that is Easterly, which they call Breeses, near the Island they rise not till about Nine in the Morning, and usually cease at about six or seven at Night; they come in gently, and grow as the Sun rises, and in the Evening comes in a kind of Westernly Wind, which we call Land-breese, because it blows off the Land, and with it the Vessels go out of Port: And to the West, that is, the Wind-ward, as the East is called Lee-ward. This Island has never been troubled with those dreadful Hurricanes that so often Ruine and Afflict the <HI>Charibe Islands, Portorico, Hispaniola, Cuba,</HI> and
<PB N="9" REF="10"/> many parts of the Main. Here is no great Ebb or Flood of the Sea, we have not Observed above a foot difference, nor can any Pilot give any certain Account of the Currents of these Seas, they are so various and uncertain, nor can any guess why the Hurricanes and Earthquakes should never touch <HI>Jamaica,</HI> since they so often Afflict all the Islands and Continent.</P>
<P>None of the Rivers of this Island are fair or Navigable, because the Countrey is very Mountainous, and these Hills running through the Centre of it East and West, the Ri∣vers rise in them, and disembogue North and South; so falling out of these high Mountains are very Rap∣pie, and because of the great Rains in them, are subject to Inundations that carry great stone Rocks and Timber along with the Torrent, so make their usual Course foul and unpassable for Boats, and make and
<PB N="10" REF="11"/> change the Bars. There are divers dry Rivers which hinder the Boats from entring into the Countrey, as particularly <HI>Minoa,</HI> that runs through <HI>Clarendon,</HI> which at some time has not a drop of Water, and at other times as much as the <HI>Thames</HI> at High Water.</P>
<P>The Mountains, whether Stony or Plantable, are generally covered with Excellent Timber for all Uses, both for Curiosity, Building, and Dying abundance of Fruit and Spice Trees: These Mountains are full of Hoggs, and there is probability of Minerals, but no Trees or Fruit that resemble ours in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>There's no Towns in this Island but on the South side, at the East by <HI>Port St. Thomas, Port Morant,</HI> se∣veral Houses called <HI>Rapp-Houses,</HI> which serve for Store-Houses and Ale-Houses for the Neighbourhood, and such Vessels as use that Port, which are but few, because the
<PB N="11" REF="11"/> Governour has not yet permitted Vessels to Discharge there.</P>
<P>At St. <HI>Davids</HI> is <HI>Yhallows Bay,</HI> about seven Leagues from <HI>Port St. Thomas,</HI> as far from <HI>Port Royal,</HI> there is several Ale-Houses and Store-Houses.</P>
<P>At <HI>Liguania,</HI> the in-side of the Harbour, opposite to <HI>Port Royal</HI> about two Leagues, is several Houses, some of them very handsom, and well Built, which place in time is like to become a pretty Town.</P>
<P><HI>Port Royal</HI> is Situate on the ex∣tream Point of Land that makes the Harbour: It runs about Twelve Miles from the Main off the Land Westernly. It has to the South the Sea, to the North the Harbour, which is the largest, safest, and most convenient in <HI>America.</HI> This Neck of Land is exceeding narrow, and nothing but a loose Sand that has neither Grass, Stone, Water, nor Trees. But being so Commodious
<PB N="12" REF="12"/> for Ships, that they are Secure all Weathers, and can unload a Float at the Merchants Key: It is the most Populous place for Trading in the Island, and there only Ships enters and are dispatch'd. In the <HI>Spaniards</HI> time there was no Houses, the Sea-men of <HI>Cromwel</HI>'s Fleet begun the Town, by Building Store-Houses, and called it <HI>Cogway,</HI> as we judge corruptly, from the <HI>Spanish</HI> word <HI>La aguia.</HI> Col. <HI>Doyly</HI> caused it to be laid out as a Town, but not very Regularly. In Sir <HI>Char. Littleton</HI>'s time it was called <HI>Port Royal,</HI> from the Excellency of the Harbour. It now contains above 1500 Houses, there is a House, though none of the best, belonging to the King: And in the Earl of <HI>Carlile</HI>'s time a fine New Church, Built partly by Liberal Subscription of divers Gentlemen Inhabiting the Island, and partly by an Assessment laid upon the Inhabitants of the Port.</P>

<P>Going from <HI>Port Royal</HI> to St. <HI>Jago de la Vega,</HI> People Land at Passage, where a Fort was in Col. <HI>Doyly</HI>'s time, and there is about Thirty Houses that are Store-Houses, Ale-Houses, and Horse-keepers, and Hackney Coaches; this being the greatest Passage in the Island, it is two Leagues from <HI>Port Royal</HI> by Sea, and six Miles from St. <HI>Jago</HI> by Land.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Jago de la Vega</HI> is Situated in a large Plain by a River that is called <HI>pro de Cabre,</HI> as having a taste of that Metal, or coming out of those Moun∣tains in <HI>Liguania,</HI> where the <HI>Spaniards</HI> told us they found of it. This Town was almost quite Deserted when Sir <HI>Tho. Lynch</HI> came to the Government, but in his time about Forty Houses were Built, and Re∣paired about one Hundred more. The Grand Court is holden Quar∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rly in this Town, and a Fair was Erected in Sir <HI>Tho. Lynch</HI> his time;
<PB N="14" REF="13"/> it has one <HI>Spanish</HI> Church, and Gen∣tlemens Houses that made it look well during the time the Governour Lived there, but since that time it is much increased in Number of Beautiful Buildings and Inhabitants.</P>
<P>At <HI>Old Harbour,</HI> about seven Miles West from St. <HI>Jago,</HI> are about Thirty Houses for the Uses and Ac∣commodation of Vessels, and Store-Houses for Planters Goods, this be∣ing esteemed the best Harbour, ex∣cepting <HI>Port Royal,</HI> in the South side. By the <HI>Spaniards</HI> it was more Frequented.</P>
<P>At <HI>Withy Wood,</HI> Twenty Miles to the West, is about forty or fifty Houses for the Accommodation of Vessels, that Road being more fre∣quented than any other on the South side, there being good Land, many Settlements, and a Pleasant Coun∣trey all about it.</P>
<P>At the Extensive Point of <HI>Port Royal</HI> was Built a Round Tower by
<PB N="15" REF="13"/> <HI>Cromwel</HI>'s Sea-men in 1656, in 1657 and 1658 Col. <HI>Doyly</HI> laid the Foun∣dation of a more Regular one, which Sir <HI>Charles Littleton</HI> near Fi∣nished in 1664, and Sir <HI>Tho. Mody∣ford</HI> in his time, which was to the Year 1671, quite finished, and Mounted in it about 36 Guns, Em∣ploying the Round Tower only as a Store-House for Ammunition. Be∣sides this he Built a Breast-work of stone, that run from the Harbour to the Sea about 200 Yards, this was to Defend the Town from any sur∣prize by Land, as the Castle was to Defend the Mouth of the Harbour. It was Named by Sir <HI>Charles Little∣ton, Charles Fort,</HI> in Honour of His Majesty. In Sir <HI>Tho. Lynch</HI> his time was Built a Fort, called <HI>James Fort,</HI> Built by Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> and the Volun∣tary Contribution of some Gentle∣men: On the Island Point of the Town, to flank the Ships at turning into the Harbour, and Batter them
<PB N="16" REF="14"/> when at Anchor in it, which the Castle cannot: He likewise made a slight Work for that purpose at <HI>Pri∣son Point,</HI> where six Guns were Mounted, and at <HI>Port Morant</HI> four Guns, and a Breast-work raised to Defend the Port.</P>
<P>Another likewise at <HI>Old Harbour,</HI> which was done in Sir <HI>Tho. Lynch</HI> his time, but many more were added in the time of the Earl of <HI>Carlisle.</HI></P>
<P>The Commodities the Countrey produces are Excellent Sugars, <HI>Cocoa,</HI> Cotton, Hides, Ginger, Tobacco, Tortoise shell, Indico, Primento, Fustick, Brazilletto, <HI>Lignum Vitae,</HI> Granadilla, Ebony; besides some Gums, <HI>Achot</HI> Drugs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This Island abounds with Cattle, and the Islands of <HI>Spaniola, Portico,</HI> and <HI>Cuba</HI> do the like; so does many Parts of the Main, the first Breed being brought out of <HI>Europe;</HI> for before the Discovery, there was none of our Cattel, great or small
<PB N="17" REF="14"/> in the <HI>West Indies:</HI> In <HI>Jamaica</HI> they Multiplyed so exceedingly, that when the <HI>English</HI> took the Island, a Cow was not worth above a Piece of Eight, and a Horse half as much. But the Army destroy'd them so, that in the Year 1671, when Sir <HI>Tho. Lynch</HI> came to the Government, a Cow was worth Twelve or Four∣teen pounds, but by the goodness of the Pasture, and the Cattle Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> Imported from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they increased so, that in the Year 1675 they were worth but four pounds <HI>per</HI> Head, one with another. Besides, here is plenty of good sprightly Horses, some Mules and Asnegroes, abundance of Hogs, Goats, and Sheep, whose Wool is hairy, the Flesh not generally so good as in <HI>England;</HI> they breed often, but live not well, unless about <HI>Al∣ligater Ponds.</HI> Rabbets live well enough, but there's no Hare nor Deer in the Island.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="15"/>
<P>In this Countrey is Hens, Turkeys, and Ducks, bred better, and are better flesh than in <HI>England.</HI> Geese are but rare, there's abundance of Excellent Wild Fowl, as <HI>Guiny</HI> Hens, Flemingoes, Teale, Ducks, Curlews, with great variety of Pidgeons, Tur∣tles, Parrots, Maces, and other Birds, whose Flesh is good, and Feathers finely coloured.</P>
<P>There is store of Fish, both in the Sea and divers Rivers, not much common to <HI>England,</HI> but a King of Lobster, Craw-fish, Eels, Mullers, and <HI>Spanish</HI> Mackrael, with abun∣dance of all sorts of Admirable Fish proper to those Seas. Tortoise are taken much on this Coast, but chiefly at the Island <HI>Cay Manos,</HI> 30 Leagues to the West of this Island, whither the Vessels go <HI>May, June,</HI> and <HI>July</HI> to Load of their Flesh that they Pickle in Bulk, and take them in that Season, when they come on shore to lay their Eggs, which they
<PB N="19" REF="15"/> do, and cover them with Sand that hatches them, and then by instinct they crawl to the Sea, where they Live, and feed on Weeds that grows in the bottom, or floats. In many Rivers and Ponds of <HI>Jamaica</HI> there's vast Numbers of Crocodiles, or Al∣legators, that is an Amphibious Creature, and breeds of an Egg, hatch'd by the Sun in the sand. A Tortoise Egg is just like the Yolk of a Hen-Egg, of which she lays near a Peck at a time; but the Allegator but a few, and are like a Turkeys; their Flesh is not good, they are voracious, and live on Fowls and Beasts that they catch by surprize, but seldom or never hurt any Man.</P>
<P>Here's an <HI>Indian</HI> Coney, called <HI>Raccoones,</HI> that is good Meat, but of a distastful shape, being some∣thing like an over-grown Rat: The Snakes in this Island are not at all hurtful, but were eaten by the <HI>In∣dians</HI> as <HI>Regaloes,</HI> as the <HI>Guanaes</HI> are
<PB N="20" REF="16"/> by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> it is but small, and of the shape of an Allegator, the Flesh is sweet and tender: The most Offensive thing in this Island are divers sorts of Flies, called <HI>Mery∣wings,</HI> from their Noise; <HI>Mutquet∣toes,</HI> from their Littleness; <HI>Galli∣nippors,</HI> from their Biting; for all sting and trouble People exceeding∣ly: And in some parts of the North there's little ugly Creatures, called by the <HI>English Gallivaches,</HI> whose bite is Mortal to Dogs, Goats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>There is in this Island none of the Fruit common to <HI>Europe</HI> but Oranges, Lemons, and Limes (a Bastard Lemon) Citrons, Pomgra∣nats, Grapes grow well enough; here is a Wild sort the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made Red Wine of: The <HI>English</HI> have but few Vines, and they require much time to Cultivate them, and are so difficultly defended from the Parrots, and other Birds, and not Ripening altogether. We think it
<PB N="21" REF="16"/> impossible to make Wine without great quantities and great Labour; for in the Countrey after every Sea∣son there's a Spring, so that the Grapes and all Fruits shoot out after, it have therefore Blossoms, Young Fruit, and Ripe all at the same time. Besides these Fruit in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> there is abundance of <HI>Plantains, Bonanoes, Tamarinds, Cathus, Guavaes, Mum∣mees,</HI> and small <HI>Oysters</HI> that grow in Clusters on Mangroves by the Sea-side, <HI>Sapolaes, Supotilla, Adue∣cades, Star-Apples, Custard-Apples,</HI> and <HI>Prickle-Apples, Pears, Pine-Apples, Prickle-Pears, Plumbs</HI> of divers sorts.</P>
<P>The Common Bread that Ordi∣nary Planters and Servants use, is <HI>Cassader,</HI> in its stead <HI>Potatoes.</HI> But the Gentlemen make Bread of Flour that comes from <HI>England</HI> and <HI>New York.</HI></P>
<P><HI>English</HI> Flowers would grow in this Island without Care and Charge,
<PB N="22" REF="17"/> but they have large and extraordi∣nary Jessemine-Trees, and other Odoriferous Trees and Plants.</P>
<P>Likewise there grows exceeding well all our Summer Herbs, so does Pease, Beans, Cabbage; and Tur∣neps, though not very well. But Carrots, Raddish, Onions pretty well. By Art, Care, and Pains Gar∣dinage would do better here than in the South parts of <HI>Spain;</HI> for though our Rains are more violent, our Droughts are not so frequent and long.</P>
<P>In this Island are abundance of Medicinal Herbs, Roots, and Plants. We have <HI>Venillaes;</HI> here's <HI>China, Sar∣saparilla, Gum Guaicum, Benjamin,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Common Drink of the Gen∣tlemen is <HI>Madera</HI> Wine and Water; at the Sugar-works they make Drink of <HI>Malasses,</HI> in other places of <HI>Cas∣sader,</HI> which they call <HI>Perinoe,</HI> and of <HI>Potatoes,</HI> called <HI>Mobbie;</HI> and like∣wise
<PB N="23" REF="17"/> of <HI>Bonanoes.</HI> A Drink is made of a Spirit, called <HI>Rum,</HI> Distilled from the Canes, they make great quantities, which does Mischief, be∣ing very strong and unpleasant, yet drunk by the Ordinary People ex∣cessivly, that causes Drunkenness, Disorder, Poverty, Diseases.</P>
<P>The 11th. of <HI>October,</HI> 1492, <HI>Col∣lumbus</HI> Discovered the <HI>Lucca's Islands, Spaniola,</HI> and <HI>Cuba,</HI> and shortly after return'd for <HI>Spain.</HI> In his second Voyage, endeavouring to round <HI>Cuba,</HI> to know whether it was an Island or no, he Discovered <HI>Jamaica</HI> the 14th. of <HI>May,</HI> 1494. and called it St. <HI>Jago,</HI> which Name did not take, he staid but little on it at its Disco∣very; but in his Third Voyage, in the Year 1503, the 23d. of <HI>June,</HI> he arrived there again, Ship-wrackt, and in great Distress, his Vessels quite disabled, Provisions spent, and Men sick and dis-heartened with their Misfortunes. At <HI>Veragua</HI> on
<PB N="24" REF="18"/> the Coast of the Main, the first Road he fell in with he did not like, but went further West to a Port he called <HI>Sancta Gloria,</HI> and there run his ships on ground and lash'd them toge∣ther, and Lodg'd on their Decks, the <HI>Indians</HI> being Numerous, for at this time it was supposed there was above 60000 Families of them on this Island. <HI>Collumbus</HI> lay about two Months in a most Miserable Condi∣tion, the ingrateful <HI>Spaniards</HI> and Malicious Governour of St. <HI>Domingo</HI> sending him no Relief, on purpose to make him Perish; and in this Fa∣tal time the <HI>Porra's,</HI> three Brothers of <HI>Sevil,</HI> Rebelled, which <HI>Collum∣bus</HI>'s Brother suppress'd; so that in this Island was the first Civil War and Blood-shed betwixt the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI> in <HI>America.</HI> In the time this great Unfortunate Man staid thus Miserably, and ship-wrackt on the North side of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> it's suppose<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they began to settle a Design to Plant
<PB N="25" REF="18"/> finding this Island very fertile, and the Natives more civil and ingeni∣ous than any of the other Islanders. And at this time began that Town, the old Maps call <HI>Metilla,</HI> that we think were about Fig-tree on the North side, which was but by lit∣tle advanced, then they deserted it. Eight or ten Leagues further West, finding a better Bay they call'd St. <HI>Anns,</HI> which Names is continued by us. And here they began to settle, and in some years built a handsom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arge Town named <HI>Sevil,</HI> that had some Sugar Works, and good Plan¦tations about it, and a very conside∣rable Abbey in it; the Abbots were alwaies the Bishops Suffragan, and chief in all Ecclesiastical affairs; there's some Pillars of this left, and a Portal of the Church, with the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifths Arms over it, and an Inscription that says; <HI>Petrus Martir Anuleria Abbas Ʋnius Insule, eadem hanc Bisigne consump∣tam
<PB N="26" REF="19"/> Letantio &amp; quadrata Lapido a fundamentis extruxit.</HI> This being a most learned Millener, that had served King <HI>Ferdinand</HI> as Confessor and Embassador to <HI>Grand Cape,</HI> and being of the Emperours Council for the <HI>Indies,</HI> of which he wrote the <HI>Decades.</HI> It may be suppos'd <HI>Ja∣maica</HI> was then in great esteem. This Town flourish'd till about the year 1590. then the <HI>Spaniards</HI> deserted, as they say, because their Children could not live there. But we rather believe, because the North side was Mountainous and unpleasant; and on the South were huge plain <HI>Sa∣vannaes,</HI> which we suppose were Fields of <HI>Indian</HI> Corn and <HI>Cassader</HI> that were proper for Cattle, of which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> now have grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> plenty. Besides, the South had better Ports, was nearer, and had greater Commerce with the rich Country o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Maine,</HI> then the North could have, which might reasonably e∣nough
<PB N="27" REF="19"/> induce them to change Situa∣tions, and fix on that of the <HI>Jago de la Vega,</HI> or St. <HI>James</HI> upon the Plain, where they were settled 70 years. Before the <HI>English</HI> under General <HI>Ve∣nables,</HI> the 10th of <HI>May,</HI> 1655. took it, it had about 17 years before been surpriz'd by one <HI>Jackson,</HI> with a Fleet of <HI>English</HI> Privateers, who, for a thousand Beeves quitted the Town, having no design but to Cruise. But <HI>Crumwell</HI> sent his Army to seize <HI>Spa∣niola,</HI> or some place that was conve∣nient for a Collony and seat of War, he having mist St. <HI>Domingo</HI> they re∣solved to fix here; nor were they like to be beaten out, for there was not many Native <HI>Indians</HI> left, they being long before destroy'd by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> there was not above 550 Men, 600 Women, and 1500 Slaves; there was no Militia or Fortification. The Town had in it two Churches, four Chappels, about 1200 Houses of all
<PB N="28" REF="20"/> sorts; the Streets Regular, but Houses low and like Barns: all the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and their Wives and Chil∣dren dwell in them, and had their Servants and Slaves in the Country, to manage their Cattel, Sugar works, and Cocoa Walks, and furnish them with Provisions, which they lazily and luxuriously spent in the Town; the Trade they had was with <HI>Carta∣gena</HI> and <HI>Portobella,</HI> and sometimes with Interlopers. There Merchan∣dize was Hides, Cocoa, Tallow, Su∣gar, Pimento, with which they bought what they needed. The dis∣covery of <HI>Nova Hispana</HI> and <HI>Perue</HI> unpeopled this Island, as it did <HI>Por∣terico, Spaniola</HI> and <HI>Cuba,</HI> people be∣ing less safe and rich in them after the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Privateers be∣gan to infest these <HI>Indias;</HI> besides the Inhabitants of <HI>Jamaica</HI> were dis∣couraged by being Tennant or Vas∣sals to a Proprietor; for about the year 1560. as we guess, this Island
<PB N="29" REF="20"/> was given to the Heirs of <HI>Collumbus,</HI> in compensation for the perpetual Vice-Roy-ship and Admiralty of these <HI>Indies:</HI> so they were called Dukes <HI>De la Vaga,</HI> now <HI>De Veragua,</HI> their eldest Son a Marquis, one Dr. <HI>Fulano Ramizer</HI> was Governour for the Duke <HI>De Veragua,</HI> when the <HI>English</HI> came in 1655. he was an old decrepid man: so retreated with the Priests, Women and Children into the Island and Mountains, and left the Serjeant Major <HI>D' Christovall de Alvares Sali,</HI> that was afterwards Go∣vernour, to treat with the General of the <HI>English</HI> Army, which was Col. <HI>Venables. Penn</HI> Commanded the Fleet, but both and the whole Design was to be Governed by Commanders, which were the two Generals Col. <HI>Searle</HI> Governour of <HI>Berbados,</HI> Col. <HI>Everard</HI> Governour of St. <HI>Christo∣phers,</HI> Col. <HI>Butler</HI> and Major <HI>Winslow</HI> that went with the Army, which con∣sisted of six Regiments Commanded
<PB N="30" REF="21"/> by General <HI>Venables.</HI> Col. <HI>Fortescue</HI> that after <HI>Haynes</HI> his Death was made Ma∣jor General, Col. <HI>Anthony Butler,</HI> Col. <HI>Holdup,</HI> and Col. <HI>Doyly,</HI> with two Troops one brought from <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and Commanded by Captain <HI>Jones;</HI> the otheer rais'd at <HI>Barbados,</HI> Commanded by Capt. <HI>Carter;</HI> these Landed with the Army and Regi∣ment of Seamen, Commanded by Vice-Admiral <HI>Goodson.</HI></P>
<P>The Fleet consisted of about 30 Sail of Men of War, and as many other Vessels and <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships, which were seized at <HI>Barbados.</HI> At our Ar∣rival the <HI>Spaniards</HI> pretended to de∣liver the Island by Treaty, but the General soon found they only by this Artifice endeavoured to get time to secure the Women, Chil∣dren and Wealth in the Mountains: so about 20 daies after the Armies Landing, the General sent out Par∣ties to pursue them; sometimes we took of these miserable People;
<PB N="31" REF="21"/> sometimes they surpriz'd and kill'd of ours, strangling and starving Sol∣diers: But the Stores of the Army being Landed, which were exceed∣ing great and convenient, the gross of the Fleet and two Generals, re∣turn for <HI>England;</HI> in their way of the <HI>Havanna</HI> they met the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet, which they had easily taken if they had known them. The Ships that staid was commanded by Ad∣miral <HI>Goodson,</HI> the Army by Major General <HI>Fortescue;</HI> the last in 1656. died, leaving the Souldiers in a most miserable and perishing condition; many were dead, most sick, their Stores spent, the <HI>Spanish</HI> Plantations, and their vast numbers of Cattel all destroy'd, or run wild, and the Fleet in no better condition. On <HI>Fortes∣cues</HI> Death, Col. <HI>Carter</HI> should have Commanded, but being sick he re∣sign'd to Col. <HI>Doyly,</HI> and died quick∣ly after. This lamentable Command Col. <HI>Doyly</HI> held about a year. Then
<PB N="32" REF="22"/> Major General <HI>Sedgwick</HI> came to Command, and brought some Stores and Recruits of Men out of <HI>Ireland.</HI> But before he was well in this Office he died; so did Sir <HI>William Aylesbu∣ry</HI> about 8 Months after he came over with <HI>Sedgwick;</HI> and after his Death, was by the Commissioners made one of them; for in the Inter∣vals, the Armys was Commanded by the Commissioners, and the chief power lodg'd in them, who succeed∣ed, and appointed one another when any Died or went away. On Ge∣neral <HI>Sedgwicks</HI> death, the Com∣mands Reverts again on Col. <HI>Doyly.</HI> In this time the condition of the Ar∣my, if it was possible, grew yet more lamentable; those that were not sick were discontented and Mu∣tinous, ready to have run to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> if they had known where to have found them, which occasi∣oned the Dispute between Major <HI>Throgmorton</HI> and the General: for
<PB N="33" REF="22"/> the Major was employ'd by the Of∣ficers of the Army to Petition the Commissioners for our Pay; if an Army, for subsistance; to return, if no Army. Col. <HI>Doyly</HI> was privy to this, but before the Commissioners denied it, which made <HI>Throgmorton</HI> Impeach him; to make which good, he was secured, and Col. <HI>Doyly</HI> af∣terwards; when <HI>Goodson</HI> the chief Commissioner forms a trifling Charge against him; and in defending him∣self, <HI>Throgmorton</HI> (a passionate young Gentleman; alledg'd the Court Marshall had no power to Try him; whereupon he was thrust rude∣ly out of the Court, and the hold∣ing up his Hand to save his Head, when the Marshal offer'd to strike him with the Hilt of his Sword, was on the Marshal Generals Oath Judg'd a resisting of him: so the most un∣happy, most ingenious and hansom man that ever was on <HI>Jamaica,</HI> was shot to death, in which his Col. <HI>Bar∣rington</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="23"/> had as great a hand as the General.</P>
<P>In 1657. <HI>Cromwell</HI> sent over Col. <HI>Richard Bryan</HI> to Command, with two Regiments out of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> the one was his own, the other Col. <HI>Moors,</HI> both the best men that ever came to <HI>Jamaica.</HI> During the time of his Government, came Col. <HI>Stokes,</HI> the Governour of <HI>Me∣vis,</HI> as one of the Commissioners, with about 1700 People of all sorts, and they settle at <HI>Portmorant,</HI> where they began the first Plantation and Civil Government. But almost all these Planters, with General <HI>Stokes</HI> and General <HI>Bryan,</HI> die. In a short time <HI>Bryan</HI> was infinitely lamented, being a wise man, and perfectly qua∣lif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed for the Command and Design: so the Government again falls to Col. <HI>Doyly,</HI> that neither loved, encou∣raged, nor understood Planting: In all this time the Fleet did nothing, only <HI>Goodson</HI> had taken <HI>Santa Mar∣tha
<PB N="35" REF="23"/> Rio de Hach,</HI> and some such pitiful places that relieved the Sea men, but was no benefit to the Army, which now almost perish'd by Dis∣eases and want, tho they had divers supplies from <HI>England,</HI> yet the co∣vetousness, and ill conduct of the Officers, hindred them from making the best use of that, and the good Land that they were Masters of. But those that survived, being the most industrious and spirited men, were now grown season'd and acquainted with the <HI>Indias,</HI> and thereby capa∣ble of doing more than the great Army; and <HI>Cromwell</HI> having sent Capt. <HI>Mints</HI> in a Third Rate Frigat, Capt. <HI>Heytub</HI> in a Fifth, and Capt. <HI>Heylin</HI> in a Sixth, Col. <HI>Doyly</HI> puts on Board them 300 Souldiers Com∣manded by Major <HI>Wilbraham,</HI> Capt. <HI>Thomas Morgan,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Linch,</HI> these being got high enough to wind-ward, Landed and took <HI>Cu∣mana;</HI> afterwards rang'd down all

<P>In 1658. the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Landed 300 men at <HI>Chircras,</HI> on the North side, and endeavour'd to Fortifie and provide for a great Body that was to come from <HI>New Spain,</HI> by way of St. <HI>Jago de Cuba:</HI> But the General having notice, sent a Party that Razed the Fort, and kill'd and took almost all the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> Be∣fore this time, all the Women and Children were gone to <HI>Cuba,</HI> and only the men and Slaves remained under the Command of the Go∣vernour, who skult up and down the Mountains, and lived so wretch∣ed a life, that most of his <HI>Negroes</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="24"/> had deserted him, and were come in to submit to the <HI>English</HI> General, under the conduct of one <HI>Juan de Bola,</HI> an ingenious Slave, that had from Col. <HI>Doyly</HI> a Commission (as 'twas call'd) to settle with them at <HI>Caymanos</HI> by St. <HI>Jago,</HI> where he Go∣vern'd them, and was afterwards kill'd by some of our Run-away <HI>Ne∣groes.</HI></P>
<P>In 1659. the <HI>Spaniards</HI> sent the long expected Body of men, that consisted of about 1200. who Land∣ed and fortified at <HI>Rio Nova,</HI> on the North side; as soon as we had no∣tice, the General himself went thi∣ther with about 600 choice men and Volunteers that were embarked on the <HI>Grantham</HI> a Fifth Rate, and <HI>Blackmore</HI> a Sixth Rate, and some other small Vessels, who Landed the General and his men in the very Port; the next day they Attaqued and took the Fort, the most of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> being kill'd and taken in
<PB N="38" REF="25"/> it, which was the bravest and last Action the <HI>English</HI> Army did on <HI>Ja∣maica,</HI> for after this the <HI>Spaniard</HI> sent no more People or Supplies. But the Governour <HI>Don Christopher</HI> en∣deavour'd to get off himself. The latter end of this year Col. <HI>Doyly</HI> sent to <HI>Cromwell</HI> 10 or 12 Colours as Marks and Trophies of this Victory.

<P>In 1660. there was a Mutiny, for which Col. <HI>Tyson</HI> and Col. <HI>Boymond</HI> was shot to Death.</P>
<P>In 1661. his Majesty sent Col. <HI>Doyly</HI> a Commission for Governour, with order to Disband the Army; upon which he Erects a Civil Go∣vernment, and People begin to Plant, judging the Island would not be sur∣rendred again to the <HI>Spaniard.</HI></P>

<P>In the beginning of 1664. the Council chose Col. <HI>Thomas Linch</HI> their President, and Sir <HI>Charles Lit∣tleton</HI> made him Commander in chief, which he exercis'd till the Ar∣rival of Sir <HI>Thomas Modyford.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Tho. Modyford</HI> came in <HI>June,</HI> 1664. and a week before him Col. <HI>Edw. Morgan;</HI> and now People be∣gan vigorously to apply themselves to Planting, Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> understand∣ing and incouraging it exceedingly. In the <HI>Griffin</HI> he sent his eldest Son, the Major General, for his Lady: But the Frigat and he was both cast away near the Gulph of <HI>Florida;</HI> so she came not till the year follow∣ing. At the beginning of his Go∣vernment he endeavour'd a Peace with the <HI>Spaniards:</HI> But not being
<PB N="41" REF="26"/> able to effect it, he encourages the Privateers; and Capt. <HI>Henry Mor∣gan</HI> having signalized his courage by burning a <HI>Spanish</HI> Admiral that shut him and Capt. <HI>Pennant,</HI> and other Privateers, up in the Bay of <HI>Mari∣caio;</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> made use of him to Imbody the Privateers, which he effects in the year 1668. and Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> makes him Admiral. And that joyning with several <HI>French,</HI> by the assistance of a <HI>Dutch</HI> man, Lands in the Bay, and came over the Moun∣tains by night into the Town of <HI>Porto Bello,</HI> which they surpriz'd and resolutely took the Castle that com∣manded the Town: and afterwards that which commanded the Har∣bour, then quitted both, having —pieces of Eight for delivering the Powder, and not Razing their Forts. With this Money he brought the Plague to <HI>Jamaica</HI> that kill'd my Lady <HI>Modyford,</HI> and many People. And in the year following Sir <HI>Thomas
<PB N="42" REF="27"/> Modyford</HI> employ'd Major <HI>Beeston</HI> to draw the Privateers together again, to serve under Admiral <HI>Morgan;</HI> which he effected, and they joyning with divers <HI>French</HI> Vessels went for <HI>Panama,</HI> and bravely took the Fort of <HI>Changra.</HI> But before they came to <HI>Panama,</HI> they found it set on fire by the President, so returned to their Ships; but in beating up to <HI>Jamaica</HI> many Vessels fail'd, so that Men most miserably perish'd on barren Islands and Rocks. By this and such like Designs, many brave men were lost, and no real advantage brought to the Island. And in the year 1670. the Treaty about the <HI>West Indies</HI> was concluded at <HI>Madera,</HI> and Sir <HI>Thomas Modyford</HI> removed.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Linch</HI> made his Maje∣sties Lieutenant, Governour and Commander in Chief, and arrived at <HI>Jamaica, June</HI> 24. 1671. The same Month he sent Major <HI>William Beeston</HI> to <HI>Cartagena</HI> in the <HI>Assistance</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="27"/> Frigat to notifie the Peace; and the <HI>March</HI> following, he made Sir <HI>Tho∣mas Modyford</HI> a Prisoner (aboard the Frigat) and sent him for <HI>Eng∣land</HI> for breaking the Peace with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> contrary to his Majesties Express Orders. And five or six Months after Admiral <HI>Morgan,</HI> on the same account, Sir <HI>Thomas Linch</HI> endeavoured to procure a good un∣understanding between the two Na∣tions, according to the Treaty and his Orders, and put to Death. One <HI>Jonson</HI> a <HI>Dutch</HI> man, which was the only Privateer ever suffered for all the Murther, Rapine and Violence those dissolute People have com∣mitted on the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> In his time the <HI>Portland</HI> took a <HI>Caper,</HI> and the <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Francis,</HI> His Maje∣sties Hir'd Ship, and a Privateer, took a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship of 544 Negroes, which were more beneficial to the Island than all the Prizes ever brought to it. During the time of
<PB N="44" REF="28"/> his Government, many Ships were loaded with the Product of the Island; before, it never one. And in the end of his Government, Land was risen to five times the value it was at in the beginning. Col. <HI>Tas∣sel</HI> and Mr. <HI>Rogers,</HI> at his command, run a Chain round the Island. An exact Mapp and Survey was sent home by my Lord <HI>Vaughan:</HI> in his time were abundance of Cattel Im∣ported from <HI>Cuba,</HI> which brought down their Price from 12 to 14 <HI>l. per</HI> Head, to 4 and 5 <HI>l.</HI> In his time Fairs and Markets were Erected at St. <HI>Jago, Liguania, Port-Royal,</HI> &amp;c. Sir <HI>Thomas Linch</HI> remitted to the Kings principal Secretary of State, a large and exact State of the Govern∣ment of <HI>Jamaica:</HI> of the Church, the Laws, the Militia, and Revenue, which was in brief thus:</P>
<P>His Majesty is Soveraign Lord and Proprietor of this Island, in all
<PB N="45" REF="28"/> Writs, Commissions and Grants; He is stiled, <HI>King of</HI> England, <HI>&amp;c. and Lord of</HI> Jamaica; the Gover∣nour Represents His Person, and is invested with his Power, being en∣abled by his Commission under the Great Seal, and directed by his In∣struction how to Govern; and it is alwaies during his Majesties plea∣sure.</P>
<P>Here 12 Councellours are cho∣sen by the Governour, and Consti∣tuted in all Emergencies and Causes, like the King's Councel here, the which they Resemble, and the House of Lords, because they Sit with the Assembly; the Governour cannot suspend them without giving Advice to the Principal Secretary of the Cause. This Government by pra∣ctice as well as order from His Ma∣jesty, is Assimulated as near as pos∣sible to that in <HI>England,</HI> which ren∣ders it grateful to the People, who believe they ought to enjoy their
<PB N="46" REF="29"/> Property and Native Right, where they are under the King's Dominion, so nothing be inflicted on them but by the course of Law, nor taken from them but by Acts themselves have consented to. Therefore they have by His Majesties Order in <HI>Ja∣maica</HI> Assemblies that consist of 32 Persons, chosen indifferently by the Freeholders of the 14 Parishes. In these Assemblies the Governour has a Negative Voice: he Calls, Prorogues and Dissolves them at pleasure; the Governour, the Councel, and the Assembly are invested with the Le∣gislative Power, and are Convened to make some little Municipal Laws, proper to the usage of the Island, about Governing Servants, Slaves, Officers, High-waies, Church, Mi∣litia, but chiefly to raise Money for the support of the Government. What Laws they make are to be sent into <HI>England,</HI> and to be of force but for two years, unless the King con∣sent;
<PB N="47" REF="29"/> then perpetual, unless Re∣voked as they were made.</P>
<P>There is but seven Churches in the Island, that is, one at St. <HI>Davids, Liguania, Port-Royal,</HI> St. <HI>Jago,</HI> St. <HI>Johns</HI> and <HI>Vere.</HI> The Governour seems to be the King's Deputy, or Bi∣shop of <HI>London</HI>'s Suffragan, for he Presents and Inducts; and the Par∣sons being admitted, every Parish is bound to allow 100 <HI>l. per annum,</HI> at the least, <HI>Pot-Royal</HI> 200 <HI>l.</HI> St. <HI>Jago</HI> 130 <HI>l.</HI> by Act of the Assembly made in Sir <HI>Thomas Linch</HI> his time, when only these Parishes above-named were supply'd.</P>
<P>The Governours Residence was at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> more within the Land, and easier for People to apply them∣selves to him; he named or appoint∣ed all the Officers, only such as the King made under the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> as the Secretary of the Island, that makes all the publique Dispatches, keeps the Office of In∣rollment.
<PB N="48" REF="30"/> And the Marshal, who is the Executive Officer of Justice, in the nature of a Sheriff, Usher of the Black-Rod, and Jaylor, for the Ad∣ministration of Justice, and better Government of the Parishes. There is Sessions of the Justices Quarterly held at <HI>Morant, Liguania, Port-Royal,</HI> St. <HI>Jago,</HI> St. <HI>John Clarendon,</HI> St. <HI>Eliza∣beth;</HI> every of these Precincts have a particular <HI>Custos Rotulorum</HI> appointed, who with the Justices and other Of∣ficers Present, Reform, Examine and punish all Crimes, Disorders and Misdemeanors that are within their Cognizance by the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> or those of the Island. All <HI>Pleas of the Crown</HI> and <HI>Civil Causes,</HI> are heard and Determined in the Grand Court that Sits Quarterly at St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and thither <HI>Errours</HI> and <HI>Causes</HI> are brought from the Inferiour Courts, this be∣ing like the <HI>Kings-Bench, Court of Exchequer</HI> and <HI>Assizes</HI> in <HI>England.</HI> In some extraordinary Cases the Go∣vernour
<PB N="49" REF="30"/> Grants Commissions of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Terminer.</HI> The Governour is Chancellor and Keeper of the Great Seal of the Island; which the King sent by Sir <HI>Charles Littleton</HI> to my Lord <HI>Windsor.</HI> It's a Cross charged with four Pines, the Reverse his Majesty in his Throne, an Indian kneeling and presenting him. All publique Commissions and Grants are seal'd with this Seal. To every Planter the Governour Grants Thir∣ty Acres <HI>per</HI> Head, for which he gives his Warrant, then the Survey∣or of the Precinct within which it lies, runs it out, and returns it to the Clerk of the Pattents, which draws the Grant; so 'tis held of the King in Common, and pays for what Sir <HI>Thomas Modyford</HI> Granted 25 <HI>s. per</HI> 1000. for what Sir <HI>Thomas Linch</HI> Granted a half penny <HI>per</HI> Acre.</P>
<P>By an Act of the Assembly an Of∣fice of Inrollment is Erected, and kept by the Secretary, where the
<PB N="50" REF="31"/> Pattent and all Deeds and private Writings are Recorded to prevent Law-suits and fraudulent Convey∣ances, and is in the nature of a Re∣gistry. All Actions at Law between Neighbours, are tryed in the Inferi∣our Courts, which are in the nature of Court Barons here. There's one at <HI>Morant, Liguania, Port-Royal,</HI> St. <HI>Johns, Clarendon,</HI> St. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and the North side; each Court has its Judge, 12 Assistants, Clerk, Mar∣shal; and any person may plead his own Cause. They hold Pleas of any sum under 20 <HI>l.</HI> and of greater sums, when they take a <HI>Justicias</HI> out of the Chancery, which the Gover∣nour grants of course; and here all Appeals, with the assistance of some of the Councel that sit as the Pro∣bate of Wills, Licences for Marri∣ages, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are dispatch'd in the Se∣cretarys Office; and the Governour seems to be in the nature of Judge of the Prerogative Court.</P>
<PB N="51" REF="31"/>
<P>At <HI>Port-Royal</HI> is establisht a Na∣val Office that takes care of the En∣trys, dispatches of Vessels, and the observance of their Acts of Navi∣gation.</P>
<P>The Governour is Vice Admiral to his Royal Highness, and has a Com∣mission to Command all his Maje∣sties Ships that come to the Island; and likewise a large Commission to Erect Courts of Admiralty, and ex∣ercise all those Maratime powers his Royal Highness hath; so there's at <HI>Port-Royal</HI> a Judge-Admiral, with all the needful Officers that proceed in the Court according to the forms of Admiralty used here and in other parts.</P>
<P>The Militia is Commanded by the Governour, according to the power he Reigns from His Majesty and the Laws of the Country, for there's a particular Act that appoints the time of Mustering the Persons, the Arms, aad the Places of Rendezvous.
<PB N="52" REF="32"/> Here's no Souldiers paid by the King; all the Officers are made by the Go∣vernour. At St. <HI>Thomas</HI> and St. <HI>Da∣vids</HI> is one Regiment, another at St. <HI>Andrews, Port-Royal,</HI> St. <HI>Catherines,</HI> St. <HI>Johns, Clarendon,</HI> St. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and North side: and in every one of these Regiments is one Troop of Horse; the Company and Troop that is at St. <HI>Jago</HI> wait on the Gene∣ral as his Guards on <HI>Sundays</HI> to Church; and on any other occasion the Regiment at <HI>Port-Royal</HI> keep the Fort there by half a Company at a time. All the Militia here is much more obedient, useful, better Dis∣ciplin'd and Arm'd than in <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></P>
<P>The Revenue of this Island con∣sists in what is properly the Kings, as Quit-Rents, Fines, Forfeitures, Escheats, Seizures that are Collected by His Majesties Officer, and ac∣comptable to his Order, and a Re∣venue paid by the Assembly by an
<PB N="53" REF="32"/> Impost on Strong Liquors Imported, and a Tax for Licences for Ale-houses; the Licences are received by the Secretary, and the Impost by such Collectors the Governour and Councel name and appoint; these, and all that receive any of the Kings or Publique Money, give an account thereof to a Treasurer, who Issues it out according to the Governours Order, of which he gives him and the Councel an ac∣count once every six Months, and keeps fair and open Books to shew the Assembly, or any that desire to inspect them, that every body may see the Money not misapply'd, or ill managed, that they may be encourag'd thereby to raise more when needful. In Sir <HI>Thomas Linch</HI> his time, all the Kings and Countrys Dues did not amount to 3000 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> which was not near suf∣ficient to pay the Governour and Officers Sallarys, and maintain the
<PB N="54" REF="33"/> Forts, and defray other contingent Charges.</P>
<P>This was the manner of Govern∣ment and State of the Island of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> when Sir <HI>Thomas Linch</HI> was remanded thence in 1675.</P>

<P>WHereas it evidently appeared to this Board, by a Copy of a Commission sent his Excellency by the
<PB N="58" REF="35"/> Honourable <HI>William Berk,</HI> Governor of <HI>Quariza,</HI> that the Queen Regent of <HI>Spain</HI> did by her <HI>Shadula,</HI> dated at <HI>Madrid</HI> the 20th of <HI>April 1669.</HI> Com∣manded her respective Governours in the <HI>Indies,</HI> to make open War against the Subjects of our Soveraign Lord the King in these Parts; and also that the Governour of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> of <HI>Cuba,</HI> hath executed the same by granting Commis∣sions of War against us; and lately in a most Hostile manner Landed his Men in three several places on the North side of this Island, marching as far as he durst into the Country, burning all the Houses they came at, killing and taking Prisoners all the Inhabitants they could meet with, and now lately they ap∣peared with three Ships on the South side of this Island at <HI>Michaels-hole,</HI> within eight Leagues of our chief Har∣bour, and came near the Shore full of Men; but finding the Inhabitants pre∣pared for them, went out again; and the next day Landed at <HI>Paratee-Bay,
<PB N="59" REF="35"/> 18</HI> Leagues to Lee-ward, and there burnt two Houses; and that divers of the rest of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Governours have also granted Commissions, and are le∣vying of Forces against us, and have, as we are credibly informed, made <HI>St. Jago</HI> of <HI>Cuba</HI> their present Magazine and their Rendezvous, where their pre∣sent Forces are to unite and embody, for the speedy Invasion of this Island; which intention, if it be suffered to ripen so far, as that the Enemy be ena∣bled to Land their Forces in this Island, we shall be inforced to quit the present care of our Plantations, and attend on the Enemies motion, where∣by our said Plantation will run to ruin, our Cattle and other Stock run wild, our Slaves take the Woods; and although by chance of War Conquers, put to be∣gin the World again, to our insupporta∣ble loss, and most infinite damage to his Majesties Service.</P>
<P>And whereas His Majesty hath out of his most Princely fore-sight and
<PB N="60" REF="36"/> great care of us, directed in his last Article of Royal Instructions, which his Excellency hath been pleased on this extraordinary occasion to communicate to this Board in these words:</P>
<P>As, forasmuch as there are many things incident to that Government there, for which it is not easie for us to prescribe such Rules and Directions for you as our service, and the benefit of that Island may require, instead of them you are with the Advice of the Council, to take care therein as fully and effectually as if you were instructed by us, of which extraordinary causes giving us due in∣formation, you shall receive farther sa∣tisfaction from us as our Service shall require; In discharge therefore of that great trust which is by that Instruction put in us by His Majesties Council of this Place, and in this great and ur∣gent, necessity, we humbly advise and pray your Excellency, for the seasona∣ble prevention of these impending Evils. It may Ordain, and be it so Ordained
<PB N="61" REF="36"/> by his Excellency, and His Majesties Ciuncil now Assembled, and by Autho∣rity of the same, That Commission be granted to Admiral <HI>Henry Morgan,</HI> to be Admiral and Commander in Chief of all the Ships of War belonging to this Harbour, and of all the Officers, Souldiers and Seamen belonging to the same, requiring him with all possible speed to draw into one Fleet, and with them to put to Sea for the security of the Coast of this Island, and of the Mer∣chants Ships, and other Vessels Trading to and about the same.

<PB N="62" REF="37"/> Forces are, and them accordingly take destroy, and dispose of; and to do and perform all manner of Exploits which may tend to the preservation and quiet of this Island, being His Majesties chief Interest in the <HI>Indies.</HI> And that for the better Government of the said Fleet, Officers, Souldiers and Seamen, he have power to execute Marshal Law, according to the Article of War already made, or which hereafter shall be made by his Excellency, the same having been first published unto them.

<HEAD>Instructions for Admiral <HI>Henry Mor∣gan</HI> Esq; delivered him <DATE>the 2d of <HI>July 1670.</HI></DATE> together with his Com∣mission.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. YOU will with these Instructi∣ons receive my Commission, which you are enjoyned with all Expedition to publish and put in due Execution, according to the full ex∣tent and import of the same, for the accomplishing whereof, you shall have all the assistance this Island can give you.</P>

<P N="3">3. You are to take notice and ad∣vise your Fleet and Souldiers that you are upon the old pleasing Ac∣count of no purchase no pay, and
<PB N="86" REF="40"/> therefore that all which is got, shall be divided amongst them according to accustomed Rules.</P>
<P N="4">4. In case you shall find it pru∣dential, as by your Commission you are directed to attain St. <HI>Jago</HI> of <HI>Cuba,</HI> and that God blessing you with Victory, you are hereby di∣rected, in case you do it without any considerable hazards, to keep and make good the place and Country thereabout. until you have advised me of our success, and received my farther Orders touching the same, lest your sudden quitting, and their as sudden returning beget us new work, and put us on new charges and hazards for the second defeating.</P>
<P N="5">5. In order to this you are to pro∣claim mercy and enjoyment of Estates and liberty of Customs to all the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that will submit and give assurance of his Loyalty to His Majesty, and Liberty to all the Slaves that will come in; and to such

<P N="6">6. In case you find that course to take approveable effect, you are then as much as will stand with the same to preserve the Houses, Sugar-works and Canes; but if otherwise it ap∣pear to you, that in reason you can∣not make good the place for any long time, and that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and Slaves are deaf to your Propo∣sals, you are then with all Expedi∣tion, to destroy or burn all Habita∣tions, and leave it as a Wilderness putting the Men-Slaves to the Sword, and making the Women-slaves Pri∣soners
<PB N="70" REF="41"/> to be brought hither, and sold for account of your Fleet and Army, such of the men also that can∣not speak <HI>Spanish.</HI> Or any new Ne∣gro, you may preserve for the same account; or if any Ships present, to carry them for <HI>New-England</HI> or <HI>Vir∣ginia,</HI> you may send them all on the same Account.</P>

<P>1670. In order whereunto they sailed from <HI>Port-Royal</HI> the 14th of <HI>August,</HI> with 11 Sail of Vessels, and 600 men, and having rounded the Island, we arrived at the Isle of <HI>Ash,</HI> the place of Rendez∣vous the 2 of <HI>September</HI> following, from whence we having no Advice of the course of the Enemy or their design, we dispatched away Vice Admiral <HI>Collier</HI> the sixth of the same Month, with six Sail of Vessels, and 350 men, to go for the Course of the <HI>Main</HI> to get Prisoners for Intel∣ligence for the better stearing our
<PB N="76" REF="44"/> Course and managing our design, for the most of his Majesties Honor and Service, and the safety of <HI>Ja∣maica.</HI></P>
<P>The last of <HI>September</HI> arrived to us at the Isle of <HI>Ash,</HI> Capt. <HI>John Mor∣ris,</HI> who brought with him <HI>Imanuel Riveras</HI> Vessel of eight Guns, who burnt the Coast of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> having taken him on the Coast of <HI>Cuba,</HI> and in her three original Commissions, 2 of which they sent his Excellency; the 7th of <HI>October</HI> following so vio∣lent a Storm happened in the Har∣bour that drove all the Fleet ashore except the Admirals Vessel, then consisting of 11 Sail; all of which, except three, were got off again and made serviceable.</P>
<P>In this Month arrived here three <HI>French</HI> Vessels, and conditioned to sail under our Flag, and in <HI>Novem∣ber</HI> arrived seven sail more from <HI>Ja∣maica.</HI> Now being of force enough to attempt St. <HI>Jago,</HI> we examined
<PB N="77" REF="44"/> some of our own men, who had been lately there Prisoners; and al∣so those <HI>Spaniards</HI> that were taken in <HI>Imanuel Rivers:</HI> One of our men in particular, Captain <HI>Richard Powell,</HI> Captain of the Prize that was <HI>Ri∣ver</HI>'s Ship, who had not been above 30 daies from St. <HI>Jago,</HI> declared that time of year being Winter, and be∣ing but one landing place, and that strongly fortified, it was impossible for us to attempt that place without the hazard of the whole Party, and the certain loss of the most, if not all our Vessels, by foul weather; all the knowing Prisoners examined, affirming the same, upon which we relinquished that Design.</P>
<P>The 20th of the same Month Vice Admiral <HI>Collier</HI> returned from the <HI>Main</HI> with good quantities of pro∣visions, and two of the Enemies Ves∣sels, one of which called the <HI>Galer∣deene,</HI> was assistant to <HI>Riveras</HI> in the burning the Coast of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and

<P>TO the which the Admiral con∣sented, and having called the Captains again on Board to consult of the manner of carrying on that attempt, and whereby to find Pri∣soners to be guides for <HI>Panama,</HI> it was voted that Providence being the Kings Antient propriety, and most of the people there being sent from <HI>Panama,</HI> that no place could be more fit.</P>
<PB N="83" REF="47"/>
<P><HI>December</HI> the 8th we sailed, and the 14th arrived at <HI>Providence</HI> by 8 of the Clock in the morning, and by two in the Afternoon were pos∣sessed of the great Island without resistance; the 15th, sent a Sum∣mons to the Governour to deliver the little Island, who willingly sub∣mitted to that he might have good Quarters, and Transportation to any part of the <HI>Main,</HI> which was granted and duly performed; but four of his Souldiers took up Arms with us, and became our Guides; and by them understanding the Castle of <HI>Changra</HI> blocked our way, the Admiral called a Councel of all the chief Captains, where it was determined to attain the Castle of <HI>Changra;</HI> and forthwith there was dispatched 470 men in 3 Ships, under the Command of Lieu∣tenant Gol. <HI>Joseph Bradly,</HI> with 3 Captains and 4 Lieutenants, and up∣on the 27th were safely landed with∣in four Miles of the Castle by twelve
<PB N="84" REF="48"/> of the Clock, and by two had made their approach one of the other, and by three into Trenches where they continued fighting till eight the next Morning, and then had return∣ed <HI>re infecta;</HI> if in playing of their Granadoes, they had not by good fortune set a Guard-house on fire that stood upon the Walls, which caused a breach, where our men couragiously stormed, and the Ene∣my as bravely defended it to the last Man, refusing Quarters, which cost them the lives of 360 men, and of our side was lost 30 out-right, one Capt. and one Lieutenant, and 76 wounded, whereof the brave <HI>Brad∣ly</HI> was one, with two Lieutenants, who died within ten daies after their wounds, to the grief of himself and all in general.</P>
<P><HI>Jan.</HI> 2. the Adm. arrived with the whole Fleet, and understood that the Enemy lay with Forces to endea∣vour the taking of the Castle, where∣upon
<PB N="85" REF="48"/> he gave order for the Fleet to follow him into the Harbor, but had the ill fortune to be cast away the Ship that he was in, and four more, but saved the men; the rest being come in fell to preparing to go up the River, where they understood the Enemy had entrenched themselves, and had six several retreating Breast-works upon the River.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Adm. gave order that 7 Sail of lesser Vessels should be rigged to go up the River, and filled them with Men and great Guns; and left to Guard the Castle and the Ships 300 men, under the Com∣mand of Captain <HI>Richard Norman.</HI> Monday the 9th we began our march 1400 men in the said 7 Vessels, and 36 Boats and Cannons.</P>
<P>Upon the 12th Instant we got to the first Entrenchment, where the Enemy had lately quitted it, and set all on Fire, as they did all the rest, without striking a stroke for it, and
<PB N="86" REF="49"/> there was forced to leave our Ships and Boats with 200 men to Guard them under the Gommand of Cap∣tain <HI>Robert Delander,</HI> and betook our selves to the wild Woods, where was no path for 24 Miles, but what we cut. The 14th we arrived with∣in two Miles of <HI>Venta Cruce,</HI> which was the Landing place, where was a very narrow and dangerous pas∣sage, where the Enemy thought to put a stop to our further proceed∣ing, but were presently routed by the forlorn, Commanded by Cap∣tain <HI>Thomas Regers;</HI> the rest of our men never firing shot, and without any loss, saving three men slightly wounded; but the Enemies loss we could never learn. <HI>January</HI> the 15th we arrived at <HI>Venta Cruce,</HI> which is a very fine Village, and the place where they Land and Embarque all the Goods that comes and goes to <HI>Panama,</HI> where we though we might be relieved, having marched three
<PB N="87" REF="49"/> daies without Victuals, but found it as the rest, all on Fire, and they fled.</P>
<P>The 16th we began our March, the Enemy constantly galling us with Ambuscades and small Parties, and we still beating of them for a League together, although they had all the advantage that could be of us, the way being so narrow that we could but march 4 a breast, and such a deep hollow, that the Enemy lay over our heads; about noon that day we got to the <HI>Savanes</HI> safe, with the loss of three men killed out∣right, and six or seven wounded; and of the Enemy 20 killed, and one Captain, besides many wound∣ed, we marched three Miles further, and then took up our Quarters to refresh our men, and thanked them for that daies service. The 17th we began our March forward, but had no opposition, and about nine of the Clock in the Morning, saw that
<PB N="88" REF="50"/> desired place the South Seas, and likewise a good parcel of Cattle and horses, whereupon the G. comanded a general hast to be made, and our men killed Horses and Beef enough to serve them all; about four of the Clock in the afternoon, our men having refreshed themselves, we marched again, and about five the same day we came in sight of the Enemy; where he lay in Batalia with 2100 Foot and 600 Horse, but finding the day far spent; we thought it not fit to engage, but took up our Quarters within three Miles of them, where we lay very quiet, not being so much as once alarm'd. The next morning being the 18. betimes in the morning, the Gen. gave order to draw our men in Ba∣talia, and it was accordingly per∣formed, and they were drawn in the form of a <HI>Tertia;</HI> the Vant Guard was led by Lieutenant Col. <HI>Lawrence Prince,</HI> and Major <HI>John Morris,</HI> they
<PB N="89" REF="50"/> being in number 300 men, the bo∣dy containing 600; the Right wing was led by the Gen. and the left by Col. <HI>Ed. Collier,</HI> the rear-ward of the 300 was Commanded by Col. <HI>Bledry Morgan;</HI> after having viewed our men, and a little encouraged them, the G. commanded the Officers eve∣ry man should repair to his Charge, the Enemy being drawn at such ad∣vantage, they still kept their Stati∣on; although often provoked, yet would not stir from their Ground, which we presently perceived, and gave order that our men should wheel their bodies to the left, and endeavour to gain a Hill that was hard by, which, if gained, we should have forc'd the Enemy to fight to their disadvantage, by rea∣son he could not bring out of his great body more men to fight at a time, than we could out of our small body, and likewise that we should have the advantage both of Wind
<PB N="90" REF="51"/> and Sun. The Officers putting this Command in execution, and the Hill, and a dry Gut accordingly gained, the Enemy was forced to fight upon, their long March having not room to wheel his Battel, by reason of a Bogg that was drawn behind on purpose (as he thought) to entrap us, but we taking another ground, in the end proved a snare to himself, whereupon one <HI>Francisco Detarro,</HI> gave the Charge with his Horse upon the Vant Guard, and so furiously that he came upon the full speed, we having no Pikes, gave or∣der that they should double their Ranks to the Right, and close their Files to the Right and Left inward to their close order, but his career could not be stopt till he lost his life in the front Rank of our Vant-Guard, upon which the Horse wheel off to the Right, and their Foot ad∣vanced to try their Fortunes, but it proved like their fellows, for we be∣ing
<PB N="91" REF="51"/> ready with the main Battel to re∣ceive them, gave them such a warm welcom, and pursued so close that every one thought it best to retreat, but they were so closely plyed by our left Wing, who could not come to Engage at first, by reason of the Hill, that the Enemies retreat came to plain running. Although they did work such a Stratagem that hath been seldom or never heard of, that is when the Foot Engaged in the Flank, he attempted to drive two Droves of Cattel of 1500 apiece in∣to the Right and Left Angles of the Reer, but all came to one effect, and helped nothing for their flight to the City, where they had 200 fresh men, and two Forts, one with six Brass Guns, the other with eight, and the Streets Barricadoed, and great Guns in every Street, which in all amounted to 32 brass Guns, but instead of fighting he command∣ed the City to be fired, and his chief
<PB N="92" REF="52"/> Forts to be blown up, the which was in such hast that he blew up forty of his Souldiers in it, we followed into the Town, where, in the Mar∣ket-place they made some resistance, and fired some great Guns, killed us four men, and wounded five. At three of the Clock in the after∣noon we had quiet possession of the City although on fire, with no more loss on our side in this daies work than five men killed, and ten wound∣ed. And of the Enemy about 400 where we were all forced to put the fire out of the Enemies Houses; but it was in vain, for by 12 at night it was all consumed that might be cal∣led the City; but of the Subburbs, there was saved 2 Churches, and about 300 Houses; thus was con∣sumed that famous and antient City <HI>Panama,</HI> which is the greatest Mart for Silver and Gold in the whole World, for it receives all the Goods into it that comes from old <HI>Spain</HI> in
<PB N="93" REF="52"/> the King's great Fleet, and likewise delivers to the Fleet all the Silver and Gold that comes from the Mines of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Potazi.</HI> Here in this City we stayed 28 daies, making daily Incursions upon the Enemy by Land for 20 Miles round about, without having so much as one Gun shot at us in anger, although we took in this time near 3000 Priso∣ners of all sorts, and kept likewise Barques in the South Seas, crusing and fetching of Prisoners that had fled to the Islands with their Goods and Families.</P>
<P><HI>Feb.</HI> 14. we began our March to∣wards our Ships, with all our Priso∣ners; and the next day came to <HI>Ven∣ta Cruce</HI> about 2 in the afternoon, which is from <HI>Panama</HI> five <HI>English</HI> Leagues, where we stayed refreshing our selves till the 24th. the 26th we came to <HI>Changra,</HI> where the Plunder was divided amongst the Souldiers and Seamen, which amounted to
<PB N="94" REF="53"/> about 30000 <HI>l.</HI> The sixth of <HI>March</HI> we fired the Castle, spiked the Guns, and began our Voyage for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where some are arrived, and the rest daily expected. The reason that there was no more Wealth, was be∣cause they had two Months notice of us, and had Embarqued most of their Treasure into Ships, and sent them to <HI>Lima</HI> in <HI>Peru;</HI> one Ship w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s laden with Gold, Silver and pre∣cious Stones, that contained 700 Tuns, and one of 300 Tuns.</P>

<PB N="101" REF="56"/> that Glory to be the first Finder of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and the most Juditi∣ous and sincere of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> themselves esteem but a tale, as appears by the Testimony of <HI>Gorsalo Fernando De Omedo</HI> in his Summary, and more fully in his General Hi∣story of the <HI>Indies</HI> they shew, and and so doth he which then Lived in the Court of <HI>Spain; Peter Martir</HI> another Cause that mov'd <HI>Collumbus</HI> to this Discovery and not that Pi∣lots paper or Reports; for he being a Mariner used to Sea from his youth; and sailing from <HI>Cales</HI> to <HI>Portugal,</HI> observed that at certain seasons of the year the winds used to blow from the West, which continued in that Manner a long time together, and believing that they came from some Coast beyond the Sea; he bu∣sied his mind so much therewith, that he Resolved to make some try∣al and proof thereof. When he was now forty years old he propounded
<PB N="102" REF="57"/> his purpose to the Senate of <HI>Genoa;</HI> undertaking if they would lend him Ships he would find a way by the West, unto the Island of Spices, but they Rejected his proposals as Idle fancies.</P>
<P><HI>Columbus</HI> frustrate of his hopes at <HI>Genoa,</HI> yet leaves not his Resoluti∣on but goeth to <HI>Portugal;</HI> and Com∣municates this Matter with <HI>Alphonsus</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> but finding no Entertainment to his suit, he sends his Brother <HI>Bartholomew Collumbus</HI> to King <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh of <HI>England</HI> to sollicit him in the Matter, while, himself passed into <HI>Spain</HI> to Implore the Aid of the <HI>Castillian</HI> herein.</P>
<P><HI>Bartholomew</HI> in his Voyage to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> unfortunately fell into the hands of Pirates, which Robbed him and his company, and forced him to sustain himself with making of Sea Cards; and having gotten some∣what about him, presents a Map of the World to King <HI>Henry;</HI> with his
<PB N="103" REF="57"/> Brothers offer of Discovery, which the King Gladly accepted and sent for him into <HI>England.</HI> But he had speed of his suit before in <HI>Spain,</HI> and by that King and Queen was employ'd according to his Request, for com∣ing from <HI>Lisbon</HI> to <HI>Pallos di Moguer;</HI> and then conferring with <HI>Martin Alonso Pinzon,</HI> an expert Pilot, and Frier <HI>Jo. Perez</HI> a good Cosmogra∣pher; he was Counsel'd to aquaint these with his project; the Duke <HI>De Medina Sidonia</HI> and of <HI>Medina Ce∣li,</HI> which yielding him not Credit, the Frier Counsel'd him to go to Court, and wrote in his Behalf to Fryer <HI>Fernandi Di Telavera</HI> the Queens Confessor.</P>
<P><HI>Christopher Collumbus</HI> came to the Court of <HI>Castile, Anno</HI> 1486. and found cold welcome to his suit at the hands of the King and Queen busied with Hot Wars in <HI>Granada;</HI> whence they expel'd the <HI>Moores;</HI> and thus remain'd he in Contempt
<PB N="104" REF="58"/> as a Man meanly Cloathed, without other patron then a poor Frier, save that <HI>Alonso Di quintalignia</HI> gave him his Diet, who also at the last pro∣cured him Audience of the Bishop of <HI>Toledo;</HI> by whose Mediation he was brought before the King and Queen; who gave him favourable Countenace and promis'd to Dispatch him when they had ended the wars of <HI>Granada,</HI> which also they per∣formed. Thus <HI>Collumbus</HI> is set forth with three <HI>Caravals</HI> at the Kings charges, who, because his treasure was then spent in the Wars, Borow'd 16000 Duckets of <HI>Lavis De Sanct Angelo;</HI> and on Fryday the 3 of <HI>August,</HI> in the year of our Lord 1492 in a Ship call'd the <HI>Gallega,</HI> ac∣companied with the <HI>Pinta</HI> and <HI>Nin∣na;</HI> in which the <HI>Pinzors</HI> Brethren went as pilots, with the Number of 120 persons or thereabouts, set sail for <HI>Gomera;</HI> one of the <HI>Canary</HI> Islands; and having there Refresh'd
<PB N="105" REF="58"/> himself followed his Discovery; af∣ter many Days he Incountered with an Herby Sea which looked like a green Field, so thick that he could scarce see the water, which not a little amazed the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and had caused their Return, had not the sight of some Birds promis'd them Land not far of. He taught the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to observe the Sun and Pole in their Navigation, which till this voyage they had not used nor known.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Spaniard</HI> after three and thirty days sailing, Desperate of success, Mutined and threaten'd to cast <HI>Collumbus</HI> into the Sea; dis∣daining much that a stranger a <HI>Ge∣nois</HI> had so Abused them: but he pacified their Enraged fury with Mild Speeches and Gentle promise. On the eleventh day of <HI>October</HI> one <HI>Rodrigo De Triana</HI> espied and cry∣ed, <HI>Land, Land,</HI> the best Musick that might be, Especially to <HI>Colum∣bus;</HI>
<PB N="106" REF="59"/> who to satisfie the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Im∣portunitie had promis'd the day be∣fore, that if no Land appear'd in 3 Days he would Return. One the Night before had Descried fire, which Kindled in him some hope of great Reward at the Kings Hand when he Returned into <HI>Spain;</HI> But being herein frustate he Burn'd in∣to such a flame as that it consumed Both Humanity and Christianity in him, and in the Agony of Indigna∣tion made him Leave his Country and Faith, and Revolt to the <HI>Moors,</HI> But <HI>Collumbus,</HI> how can I but Re∣member, but Love, but Admire, sweetly may those Bones Rest; Sometimes the pillars of that Tem∣ple where so Divine a spirit Resided, which neither want of former Ex∣ample nor publique Discourage∣ments of Domestique and forreign states, not private Insultation of proud <HI>Spaniards,</HI> nor length of time, which generally Devoureth the
<PB N="107" REF="59"/> best Resolutions, nor the unequal plains of Huge unknown Seas, nor Grassy Fields in <HI>Neptunes</HI> Lap, nor In∣portunate Whispering, Murmuring, threatning of enraged companions could daunt. O name <HI>Collon,</HI> wor∣thy to be named to the Worlds end; which to the Worlds end hast con∣ducted <HI>Collonies;</HI> or may I call thee <HI>Collumbo,</HI> for thy Dove-like simpli∣city and patience; the true <HI>Collonna</HI> or Pillar whereon the knowledge of the new World is founded; the true <HI>Christopher,</HI> which with more then Giant-like force and Fortitude, hast Carried Christ his name and Religi∣on through unknown Seas, to un∣known Lands, which we hope &amp; pray that it may be more Refined than Popish Superstition, and <HI>Spanish</HI> pride will yet suffer. Now let the Antients no Longer Mention <HI>Nep∣tune, Minos, Erithras</HI> or <HI>Danaus;</HI> to all which Divers authors Diversly Ascribe the Invention of Navigation <HI>Missians, Tirrians, Trojans</HI> vail your
<PB N="108" REF="60"/> bonnets, strike your Top-sail to this <HI>Indian</HI> Admiral, that deserveth the Top-sail indeed, by aspiring to the top that sailing could Aim at in Discovering another World; Let <HI>Spaniard, French, England</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Resound thy name, or his name ra∣ther, <HI>whose name who can tell,</HI> Psal. 30.4. that would acquaint thee and the World by the news of a new World.</P>
<P>But lest we drown our selves in this Sea of Extasie and Admiration, let us go on shore with <HI>Collumbus,</HI> in this new discover'd <HI>Island,</HI> and first methinks I see the <HI>Spaniards</HI> yester∣day in Mutiny, now as far Distract∣ed in Contrary passions, some gaz∣ing with greedy eyes on the Desired Land, some with tears of Joy not able to see that which the Joy of see∣ing made them not to see. Others Embracing and almost adore∣ing <HI>Collumbus,</HI> who brought them to that sight, some also with secret Repining, Envying that glory
<PB N="109" REF="60"/> to a stranger, but biting in their biting Envy, and making shew of Glee and Gladness; all new awak∣ed out of a long trance into which that step-mother Ocean with Dan∣ger, Death, Dread, Despair had Dejected them; Revived now by the sight of their Mother Earth; from whom in unknown Arms they had been so long weaned and de∣tained. On then they go, and fel∣ling a tree, make Cross thereof, which they there Erected, and took Pos∣session of that <HI>new World</HI> in the name of the Catholick King; this was done on the 11 of <HI>October, Anno.</HI> 1492 In the <HI>Island Guana ha∣ni,</HI> one of the <HI>Lucai,</HI> which <HI>Collum∣bus</HI> named <HI>San Saluatore;</HI> from whence he sailed to <HI>Baracoe</HI> a Ha∣ven on the North side of the Island <HI>Cuba;</HI> when he went on Land and asked of the Inhabitants for <HI>Cipango (Japan)</HI> they understanding him of <HI>Cibao</HI> (where are the Richest
<PB N="110" REF="61"/> Mines of <HI>Hispaniola</HI>) signed him that it was in <HI>Haiti</HI> (so was the Island then Called) and some of them went with him thither.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Some think <HI>Collumbus</HI> did run on ground on pur∣pose that he might Leave some behind him.</NOTE>What Wordly Joy is not Mix'd with some Dis∣aster after their Admi∣ral here spliteth on a Rock, but the men are saved by the help of the other Ships. This fell out in the North part of <HI>Panicola</HI> (so named by them) where they had sight of Inhabitants, who seeing these strangers Ran all away into the Mountains; one woman the <HI>Spaniards</HI> took, whom they used Kindly, and gave her Meat, Drink and Cloathes and so let her go, she declaring to her people the Liberalitie of these new comers, easily perswad∣ed them to come in troops to their shiping thinking the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to be some Divine Nation sent thither from Heaven: They had before
<PB N="111" REF="61"/> taken them for the <HI>Caribbes,</HI> which are Certain <HI>Canibals;</HI> which use Inhumane Huntings for Humane Game, to take men for to eat them; Children likewise which they geld∣ed to make them more fat; and then to devour them; the women they did not eat, but used them for Procreation, and if they were old, for other Services. The Islanders had no other Defence against them but the Woody Hills, and swiftest Heels; to which they betook them at the <HI>Spaniards</HI> arrival, thinking them (as 'tis said) to be <HI>Canniballs,</HI> and such have they since proved in effect, not leaving of three Millions of people, which here they found so many hundreds, and that long-since the Divil had forewarned them of this by Oracle, that a bearded Na∣tion should spoil their Images, and spill the blood of their Children, which was all verified, as may be seen by any that has been Conver∣sant
<PB N="112" REF="62"/> in such Tracts as Treats of those parts.</P>
<P><HI>Collumbus</HI> obtained leave of <HI>Gua∣canarillus</HI> the <HI>Cacick</HI> or King, to build a fort in which he Left 38 <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and taking with him 6 <HI>Indians,</HI> Re∣turned to <HI>Spain,</HI> where he was high∣ly welcomed by the King and Queen. Some Controversie fell out between <HI>Collumbus</HI> and one of the <HI>Pinzons,</HI> Masters of one of the <HI>Caravels,</HI> about leaving those men behind; but <HI>Col∣lumbus</HI> sent a Letter to Reduce him to peace by the <HI>Indians,</HI> who held the Letter in a most Religious Re∣gard thinking it had some Spirit or Deity, by which they could under∣stand one another being absent.</P>
<P>The Pope (then a <HI>Spaniard) Alexander</HI> the 6 hearing of this, de∣vided the World by his Bull betwixt the <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> bearing date the 4 of <HI>May</HI> 1493. Drawing a Line one hundred Leagues beyond the Island of <HI>Azores</HI> and <HI>Cape verde;</HI>
<PB N="113" REF="62"/> this <HI>Alexander</HI> giving (more then great <HI>Alexander</HI> could conquer) the East to the one and West to the other. The Bull soon after turned into a Unicorn, his 2 horns grew into one by the uniting of these two Nations.</P>
<P><HI>Collumbus</HI> Graced with the title of Admiral, and Enriched with the tenths of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Gaines in the <HI>Indies,</HI> is sent a second time with his Brother <HI>Barthol.</HI> who was made De∣puty of <HI>Hispaniola;</HI> they had fifteen hundred men; the first Island he Espied in his Second Navigation he called <HI>Desteada,</HI> or Desired, be∣cause he had longed to see Land, ar∣riving in <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> he found the <HI>Indians</HI> had Murther'd these 38 <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> which he had left there, and lay the blame on the <HI>Spanish</HI> Insolen∣cies. He now built and peopled the town of <HI>Isabella,</HI> which was their chief place of Residence and Govern∣ment, which in the year one thou∣sand
<PB N="114" REF="63"/> four hundred ninety eight, was Removed to the City of <HI>San. Dom∣ingo;</HI> they built also the fort of S. <HI>Thomas.</HI> But both in the one and the other, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Died of famine through the <HI>Indians</HI> wilful∣ness, who unwilling to have such Neighbours, would not plant their <HI>Maze</HI> and <HI>Jucca,</HI> and so starved both themselves and their Guests. As for the Pox the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in this Voy∣age got it of the <HI>Indian</HI> women, and brought them into <HI>Spain,</HI> and they after paid the <HI>Indians</HI> in Re∣compence with a Disease as deadly and Infectious to them which con∣sumed thousands, and was never known before amongst them: That is the <HI>small Pox,</HI> the other were Improperly named of the <HI>French;</HI> or of <HI>Naples,</HI> seeing that in these wars of <HI>Naples,</HI> which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Maintain'd against the <HI>French;</HI> some carryed this Disease with them out of <HI>Spain</HI> and communicated the same
<PB N="115" REF="63"/> both to the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Neapollitans,</HI> having been usual and easily Cu∣rable in the <HI>Indies.</HI> Another di∣sease also assaulted them of a little kind of flies, called <HI>Niguas,</HI> which would eat into and Breed in the flesh, and made many lose their toes.</P>
<P><HI>Collumbus</HI> at this time Discover'd <HI>Cuba</HI> and <HI>Jamaica,</HI> with the Neigh∣bour Isles, Returning to <HI>Spaniola,</HI> he found his Brother and the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI> in Dissention and separation, and punishing the Authors of sedi∣tion, Returned home. In the year of our Lord 1492 he made his third Voyage and then touched on the Continent, Discover'd <HI>Cubagua paria</HI> and <HI>Cumana.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Roldanus Ximenius</HI> raising a Rebellion and accusing the <HI>Collumbi</HI> to the King, effected that <HI>Bovadilla</HI> was sent Governor into <HI>Spaniola,</HI> who sent the two Brethren Bound as Prisoners to <HI>Spain;</HI> Base ingratitude; for the brave attempt of the wor∣thys,
<PB N="116" REF="64"/> the King freeth them and Im∣ploy'd <HI>Christopher</HI> a fourth Voyage, Anno 1502. in which <HI>Ovandus</HI> the Governour forbid <HI>Collumbus,</HI> the first finder, to Land on <HI>Hispaniola.</HI></P>
<P>He then discover'd <HI>Guanaxa, Hig∣vera, Fondura, Veragua, Ʋraba,</HI> and learned news of the South Sea. He stay'd at <HI>Jamaica</HI> to Repair his fleet, where some of his men were sick, and then they which were sound in Body were more then sick, froward and tumultuous in Behaviour, and many left him; upon this occasion the Islanders also forsook him, and brought in no victualing; herewith <HI>Collumbus</HI> neither able to abide nor depart, was driven to his shifts, no less admirable for subtilty then Re∣solution; he told the Islanders, that if they did not bring him in pro∣vision the Divine anger would con∣sume them; a sign thereof they should see in the Darkned face of the Moon 2 Days after, at that
<PB N="117" REF="64"/> time he knew the Moon would be Eclipsed, which the simple Islanders seeing, with fear and Grief, humbled themselves to him, and offered them∣selves ready to all kind and dutyful offices.</P>
<P>At last returning into <HI>Spain</HI> he there died, <HI>Anno</HI> 1506. his body was buryed at <HI>Sevil</HI> in the Temple of the <HI>Carthusians.</HI> This was the end (if ever there can be an end) of <HI>Collumbus. Pinzenus,</HI> one of <HI>Col∣lumbus</HI> his Companions, by his Ex∣ample invited, made new Discoveries: <HI>Vespatius,</HI> and <HI>Cabbet,</HI> and many other every day making new Searches and Plantations, till the World at last is come to the knowledge of this <HI>new World</HI> almost wholly.</P>
