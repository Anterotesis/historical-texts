<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Lordship,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHatever your Thoughts may be of all that can be called mine in this Work, I am certain you will approve of the design I had in
<PB REF="3"/> making it publick; which was to sa∣tisfie the World, That there has al∣ways been a considerable visible Church upon Earth, that never be∣lieved the <HI>Doctrines of the Pope's Supremacy, Purgatory, Transub∣stantiation, Adoration of Images, Auricular Confession,</HI> &amp;c. To which good End, if this Treatise should any ways contribute (as I am persuaded it must) I am then secure, that for that Reason alone you will pardon any Mi∣stakes I may have made in putting it together; as also the Presumption of inviting you to read it, by prefixing your great Name to it; a thing I should never have ventured to have done, had I not found by experience your Lordship's Candor and Goodness to be equal, to the known exactness of
<PB REF="3"/> your Judgment. I beg your Lordship's Blessing, and am,</P>

<HEAD>A Short History OF THE Church of <HI>MALABAR:</HI> From the time of its being first Dis∣covered by the <HI>Portuguezes,</HI> in the Year <HI>1501.</HI> until the Celebration of the following Synod in the Year <HI>1599.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Country of <HI>Malabar</HI> begins at <HI>Cana∣nor,</HI> a Town in the Northern <HI>Latitude</HI> of 11 degrees and 20 minutes, and ends at Cape <HI>Comorim,</HI> in the Northern <HI>Latitude</HI> of 7 degrees and ⅔ds.</P>
<P>It contains divers Kingdoms, as <HI>Cochim, Tra∣vancor, Gundaca, Pimenta, Margate,</HI> &amp;c. and a∣bounds with Ports, as <HI>Calecut, Cale, Cochim, Cou∣lam,</HI> &amp;c. Most of its Princes and Nations are <HI>Heathens,</HI> and extreamly superstitious in the Wor∣ship
<PB N="2" REF="13"/> of <HI>Pagods,</HI> of which there are several a∣mong them of incredible Riches.</P>
<P>The <HI>Serra</HI> or <HI>Gate,</HI> as the Natives call it, is a Ridge of Mountains running 200 Leagues from North to South, the South end whereof is inha∣bited by Christians, who call themselves the <HI>Chri∣stians of St. Thomas,</HI> upon the account of their ha∣ving first been converted to the Christian Faith by the Apostle of that Name. They have al∣ways, or at least for 1300 years, been under the Patriarch of <HI>Babylon,</HI> who, as their <HI>Meterane</HI> or Arch-Bishop died, took care to send them ano∣ther, who resided still among them, and was had in great Reverence both by Christians and Infidels. As for the Doctrines and Customs of this Church, I shall referr the Reader to the Ac∣counts he will meet with of them in the follow∣ing History.</P>
<P>The first news of this ancient, but remote Church, was brought to <HI>Europe</HI> by <HI>Pedral∣vares Cabral,</HI> who putting into <HI>Cranganor</HI> in the year 1501. and meeting there with several of those Christians, he perswaded two of them, who were Brothers, to come along with him to <HI>Por∣tugal,</HI> where the eldest, whose Name was <HI>Mat∣thias,</HI> died at <HI>Lisbon;</HI> and the other, whose Name was <HI>Joseph,</HI> went first to <HI>Rome,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Venice,</HI> where, upon his information, a Tract was publish'd in <HI>Latin</HI> of the State of the Church of <HI>Malabar,</HI> and is printed at the end of <HI>Fascicu∣lus Temporum.</HI></P>
<PB N="3" REF="13"/>
<P>The year following the Christians of <HI>St. Tho∣mas</HI> hearing of <HI>Don Vasco da Gama</HI> being at <HI>Co∣chim,</HI> with a considerable Fleet of Ships, sent some of their Body to let him know, that under∣standing that he was a Subject of a Christian King, they beg'd the favour of him to take them under his Masters Protection, that so they might be de∣fended against the Oppressions and Injuries which were done them daily by <HI>Infidel</HI> Princes, and for a lasting Testimony of their having put them∣selves under the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> they sent his Majesty a Rod tipp'd at both ends with Silver, with three little Bells at the head of it, which had been the Sceptre of their Christian Kings, for such they are reported to have had formerly, tho' upon no very good grounds, so far as I can per∣ceive.</P>
<P>The Admiral <HI>Vasco da Gama,</HI> not being in a condition at that time, to do any more for them, gave them a great many good words, promising them, in his Masters name, the favour and pro∣tection they had desired, and which he was sen∣sible they stood in great need of.</P>
<P>In the year 1505 two Christians, who were fa∣mous for their great skill in casting great Guns, and whom, for that reason, <HI>Don Vasco da Gama</HI> had taken along with him to the <HI>Indies,</HI> ran o∣ver to the <HI>Samorim,</HI> and were the first that in∣troduc'd the use of Artillery among the <HI>Malabars:</HI> For the <HI>Venetians</HI> foreseeing that their great <HI>In∣dian</HI> Trade would be utterly ruin'd, by the new Passage that was discover'd to the <HI>Indies</HI> by the
<PB N="4" REF="14"/> <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> if the <HI>Portugueze</HI> shou'd once get any footing in those parts, are said to have sent those two Engineers, who were their natural born Subjects, into the <HI>Portugueze</HI> service, on purpose to go over to the <HI>Indians,</HI> to teach them the use of Great Guns, and other Fire-arms, that they might be the better able to oppose the <HI>Portu∣guezes.</HI></P>
<P>But after this forementioned Complement of the Admiral, we hear no more of these Christians, till about the Year 1545, the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> being all that while too busie in making new Conquests, and the Friars, who were sent thither, too much employed in building and providing commodi∣ous Seats for their Convents, to attend to any fo∣reign Business, of what nature soever.</P>
<P>This 40 Years neglect of a Christianity, which was just under their Noses, puts me in mind of what a Minister of State said of the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Zeal in the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<Q REND="margDblQuotes"><P>Vana es Senor (<HI>speaking to</HI> Philip IV.) la Opinion que entre Nationes tudas tienen Portuguezes de Religiosos por las con∣versiones Orientales: Aquilas conquistas las Emprendio la codi∣cia, no la Religion, las conversiones se

The Con∣versions that have been made there were perform∣ed by the Divine Power, and the Charity of a few particular Friars, the Go∣vernment and Crown ha∣ving no other aim therein, but the robbing of King∣doms and Cities; and there were still the great∣est Conversions where there was most to gratify their Covetousness. But where there was nothing to be had, there the People were Obdurate, and not to be wrought upon. And so we see their Zeal expired quickly in all places, where it was not animated by Covetousness, and how they who had nothing else to say but, <HI>Lord open un∣to us,</HI> were not thought sit to enter into Heaven.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Manuel de Faria</HI> also in the Third Tome of his <HI>Asia Portuguesa,</HI> after having reckoned up the Errors (as he calls them) of the Christians of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> makes the following Reflection
<PB N="6" REF="15"/> upon his Countrymen's having been so long in reducing them to the <HI>Roman</HI> Church.</P>
<Q REND="margDblQuotes"><P>Gran lastima es oir que uviesse esto in frente de los Portu∣gueses en la India a los cien annos de su assistancia en ella; y lo que es mas a los mesmos oios de pre∣lados en Goa.

<Q REND="italic"><P>It is a shameful thing <HI>(saith he)</HI> that this Church should continue an Hundred Years in the Neighbourhood of the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> without be∣ing reduced to the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Faith, and which makes it still the worse, under the Eye of the Bi∣shops of <HI>Goa;</HI> but the truth is, those Merchants whom Christ whipp'd out of the Temple, were such as these.</P></Q>
<P>Tho' after all, the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> Negligence in this matter was nothing so scandalous as the Vio∣lences they afterwards made use of in the re∣ducing of them.</P>
<P>In the Year 1544. the Cross and other <HI>Reliques</HI> of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> which have since made such a Noise in the World, were found at <HI>Meliapor,</HI> the <HI>Legend</HI> whereof in short is, <HI>That the</HI> Portuguezes <HI>as they were pulling down an old Chappel in order to re∣build it, met with a vast Stone some Foot under∣ground, which having lifted up with great ease, they found all the Earth under it stain'd deep with Blood, that appear'd very fresh, and thereon a Cross excel∣lently
<PB N="7" REF="15"/> well cut, after the fashion of that of the Mi∣litary Order of</HI> Aviz <HI>in</HI> Portugal, <HI>and over it a Dove or Peacock</HI> (for the learned are not agreed which 'twas) <HI>and above that a bloody Dagger. There was also an Inscription on the Stone, but in Letters that no Body knew what to make of. There was a Cross of the same Saint, and found much after the same manner by the</HI> Portuguezes <HI>in</HI> Me∣liapor <HI>in the Year</HI> 1522. <HI>with this Inscription: <HI>At the time when</HI></HI> Thomas <HI>founded this Temple, the King of</HI> Meliapor <HI>made him a Grant of the Customs of all the Merchandizes that were brought into that Port, which Duty was the Tenth part of the Goods. <HI>With this Cross were also found the Bones of St.</HI></HI> Thomas, <HI>which were reckoned by all the World before to have been lodged at</HI> Edessa. <HI>There was also found an ancient Record of St.</HI> Thomas<HI>'s having converted the King of</HI> Me∣liapor (who it's like was the Prince that gave him the forementioned Grant) <HI>by drawing a great piece of Timber ashore, which the King and St.</HI> Thomas <HI>both pretended a right to, after all the King's Elephants, and all the Wit of Man were not able so much as to wag it. A Prophecy of St.</HI> Thomas <HI>was also found in the same Treasure, de∣claring that whenever the Sea shou'd come up to</HI> Meliapor, <HI>which was then Twelve Leagues from it, a Nation shou'd come from the West, which shou'd preach the very same Faith that he had preached.</HI></P>
<P>And to put all this <HI>Indian</HI> Treasure together, for it is pity any of it should be lost, the Bones of the Three Kings were found in the same
<PB N="8" REF="16"/> Grave with those of the Apostle, which were known to be theirs, by an ancient <HI>MS.</HI> which gave the following account of them. <HI>The King of</HI> Nubia <HI>and</HI> Arabia <HI>was</HI> Melchior, Baltasar <HI>was King of</HI> Goli <HI>and</HI> Saba, Gaspar <HI>was King of</HI> Tur∣si, Insula, <HI>and</HI> Grisola <HI>or</HI> Malabar, <HI>where the Bo∣dy of St.</HI> Thomas <HI>lieth, by whom they were all three consecrated Bishops, and were afterwards mar∣tyr'd with him.</HI> I leave the Examination of the truth of this <HI>MS.</HI> to the City of <HI>Cologne,</HI> whose concern it is.</P>
<P>Among other things there was a Copper plate found, with the following Donation engraved upon it: <HI>This is the Testimony of Alms, by which Paradise is acquired, and which all the following Kings, who shall distribute the said Alms, shall certainly obtain: Whereas they that shall refuse to give them, shall be Six Thousand Years with Worms in Hell.</HI> This Imprecation is literally used by the ancient Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> in most of their cha∣ritable Donations; but whether the <HI>Spanish</HI> Kings had it from the <HI>Indian,</HI> or the <HI>Indian</HI> from the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> is not certainly known.</P>
<P>In the Year 1645. <HI>Dom Joan Dalbuquerque</HI> the first Arch-Bishop of <HI>Goa,</HI> being ashamed, it's like, of their talking so much in <HI>Europe,</HI> and doing so little in <HI>India</HI> in the matters of Reli∣gion, sends one <HI>Vincent,</HI> a <HI>Franciscan</HI> Friar, of which Order the Arch-Bishop himself was, to <HI>Cranganor,</HI> to try what he could do towards the reducing of those Christians to the obedience of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church. The Labours of this
<PB N="9" REF="16"/> single Friar are so strangely magnified by the <HI>Portuguezes,</HI> that it looks as if it were done on purpose to excuse their not employing of more Hands in a Work, which here in <HI>Europe</HI> they pretended was their chief Business in the <HI>In∣dies.</HI> For he is said not only to have preached daily in their Churches, which were built af∣ter the fashion of the <HI>Pagod</HI> Temples, but also to have built several Churches among them af∣ter the <HI>Latin</HI> way; and at last, by the order of the Vice-Roy and Archbishop, upon his having in∣form'd them of the small success that his preach∣ing had had among them, to have erected a College at <HI>Cranganor</HI> in the Year 1546. in order to the instructing of their Sons in the Learning and Usages of the <HI>Latin</HI> Church.</P>
<P>By the way, It is somewhat strange how Fri∣ar <HI>Vincent,</HI> who is not said to have had the gift of Tongues, no more than the Jesuite <HI>Xavier,</HI> who himself complained, That for want of it he was forc'd to prattle more like a Child, than preach like an Apostle among the <HI>Infidels,</HI> shou'd commence so powerful a Preacher among the <HI>Malabars,</HI> the very first Year of his being in the <HI>Indies;</HI> a Year being a very short time for a Man to make himself so far Master of a strange Language, as to be able to Preach therein to any purpose.</P>
<P>But tho' the Christians of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> did not deny to send their Sons to this College, several of whom, after their having been taught <HI>Latin,</HI> were Ordained Priests, according to the <HI>Roman</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="17"/> Rites: Yet this had little or no effect as to the reducing of that Church to the Papal Obedience, to which they still continued so averse, that they treated those Natives with the same disregard that they did the other <HI>Latin</HI> Priests.</P>
<P>Thus matters continued with the Church of <HI>Malabar</HI> till the Year 1587. when the Jesuits i∣magining the reason why this Christianity was so little benefitted by having several of their Sons bred in the College at <HI>Cranganor,</HI> was their not being taught <HI>Chaldee</HI> or <HI>Syriack,</HI> which is the Language all their Offices are in, did thereup∣on erect a new College, which was built at the sole charge of <HI>Antonio Guedes Morales,</HI> at a place called <HI>Chanota,</HI> or <HI>Vaipicotta,</HI> a Village inha∣bited by those Christians, and which is about a League from <HI>Cranganor.</HI></P>
<P>But notwithstanding the Jesuits, by educa∣ting several of the <HI>Malabars</HI> in the <HI>Chaldee</HI> Tongue, and instructing them thorowly in the <HI>Latin</HI> Faith, did qualify them to serve the <HI>Roman</HI> Church in her Pretensions. Yet all this signified very little, none that had been educated by them daring so much as to mutter the least Word against any of their ancient Doctrines, or in favour of the <HI>Roman,</HI> or to alter any thing in their Offices, or forbear praying for the Bishop of <HI>Babylon</HI> as their Patriarch, in the <HI>Mass.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> finding that these Christians were not by any thing that Friars could say or do to them, to be perswaded out of their ancient Faith, or to forsake their pre∣sent
<PB N="11" REF="17"/> Bishop to submit themselves to the Pope, a∣gainst whom they were so possessed, that they cou'd not endure so much as to hear him na∣med, resolved, at last, to try other methods with them, that is, to try what Violence would do, the Method to which Popery, where-ever it is, owes both its Propagation and Establishment.</P>
<P>And that they did not betake themselves to this course sooner, we are not to imagine was in the least owing to their temper, or to any disposition that was in them, to try first what fair and gentle means would do; for they must know nothing of the <HI>Spirit of Popery,</HI> that can imagine it to be capable of any such thing, but it was owing purely to the circumstances of their Affairs; for that before their Government had spread it self, and taken a good root in those Parts, it would not have been safe for them to have made use of those rude and boisterous Me∣thods for the reduction of these Christians, which we shall see they did afterwards, when they had in a manner gotten that whole Countrey into their own Power: In pursuance of the fore∣mentioned Resolution, the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> determi∣ned to have their Bishop, to whose presence a∣mong them they attributed their constancy in their ancient Faith, seized in order to send him to <HI>Rome,</HI> which was executed accordingly.</P>
<P>Their Bishop at that time (for they had but one of that Order among them) was one <HI>Mar Joseph,</HI> who, according to ancient Custom, had been sent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>er by <HI>Mar Audixa,</HI> Patriarch of
<PB N="12" REF="18"/> <HI>Babylon.</HI> He is acknowledged by the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> to have reformed divers Abuses in that Church, and to have put things in a much better order than he found them in. <HI>Mar Joseph</HI> being brought Prisoner from <HI>Cochim</HI> to <HI>Goa,</HI> was Em∣barked upon the first Ships that went to <HI>Portu∣gal,</HI> with an intent of sending him to <HI>Rome;</HI> but being arrived at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> he, by his Address and appearances of an extraordinary Sanctity, did so far insinuate himself into the favour and good opinion of <HI>Dona Caterina,</HI> who was Queen Regent at that time, and of the Infanta <HI>Dona Maria,</HI> that he was sent back by the next Ships to <HI>Goa,</HI> with the Queen Regents Letters, order∣ing him to be permitted to live quietly in his Bishoprick, he having promised the Cardinal Infante <HI>Don Anrique,</HI> who was at that time <HI>In∣quisitor-General,</HI> and the Pope's Legate <HI>à latere</HI> to the Crown of <HI>Portugal,</HI> to do all that was in his power towards the reducing of his Diocess to the <HI>Roman</HI> obedience.</P>
<P>In the Year 1552, one <HI>Tum Siud,</HI> or <HI>Simon Sa∣lacan,</HI> a Monk of the Order of St. <HI>Pachomius,</HI> who pretended to have been chose Patriarch of <HI>Mosul,</HI> or <HI>Seleucia Parthorum,</HI> or <HI>Babylon,</HI> for they are all the same by the whole Clergy of <HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>Assyria,</HI> came to <HI>Rome</HI> and submitted himself to the Pope; by whom, according to some, he was consecrated a Bishop, tho' others will have it, that he had only his Eastern Consecra∣tion confirmed, and afterwards received the <HI>Pa∣triarchal Pallium.</HI> He presented Letters and a
<PB N="13" REF="18"/> Confession of Faith to the <HI>Pope,</HI> which he pre∣tended were sent by all the Eastern Bishops: In the Letters the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Supremacy was exalted as hig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as if they had been writ by a Parasite Canonist; which Letters, together with the Con∣fession of Faith, were done into Latin and Prin∣ted by <HI>Masius:</HI> He gave out also, that he was attended by Seventy Persons of note as far as <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and from thence only by Three, where∣of one died by the way, and another remained sick in the Journey; and the third, whose name was <HI>Calafi,</HI> came with him to <HI>Rome. Tum Siud,</HI> after he was dismissed at <HI>Rome,</HI> instead of re∣turning to <HI>Babylon,</HI> went and lived in an ob∣scure place called <HI>Charamet</HI> or <HI>Amed,</HI> where in a short time he was put to death by the <HI>Maho∣metans;</HI> and, as it is said, at the instigation of the <HI>Christians</HI> of those Parts, who, to the great discredit of the pretensions he had made at <HI>Rome,</HI> would never own him nor his Authority. But this ill Success did not hinder another Monk of the same Order, whose name was <HI>Abd Jesu</HI> or <HI>Hebed,</HI> who had writ several Books in defence of <HI>Nestorianism,</HI> from coming to <HI>Rome</HI> with the same pretensions, in the Year 1562; and he could ne∣ver have come in a better time, by reason of the Council of <HI>Trent</HI> being then sitting, to which he was sent with great Solemnity to represent nothing less than all the <HI>Chaldaean</HI> Bishops, having before at <HI>Rome</HI> in their Name, made the sub∣mission of that whole Church to the <HI>Pope:</HI> This method of making a noise with <HI>Mock-Prelates,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="19"/> had been made great use of by some former <HI>Popes.</HI> So <HI>Eugenius</HI> the IV. maintained his tot∣tering reputation against the Council of <HI>Basil,</HI> by an appearance of <HI>Graecians</HI> and <HI>Armenians</HI> in the Council of <HI>Florence:</HI> And <HI>Paul</HI> the III. gra∣ced his Translation of the Council from <HI>Trent</HI> to <HI>Bolongia,</HI> which was so stoutly opposed by the Emperor and <HI>Spanish</HI> Bishops, by sending one <HI>Ste∣phen</HI> to <HI>Bolognia</HI> with the splendid Title of the <HI>Armenian Patriarch.</HI></P>
<P>This Humor was carried on by one <HI>Elias,</HI> who likewise pretended to be chose Patriarch of <HI>Ba∣bylon;</HI> he sent several <HI>Nuncio's</HI> to the Pope with the Submission of the <HI>Babylonish</HI> Church, and a Confession of Faith; but these <HI>Nuncio's</HI> spoiled their business by over-acting their Parts; for it having been discovered, that the better to sup∣port their Pretence of the <HI>Chaldaean</HI> Church agreeing with the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> in all things, they had tore several Pages out of their Church-Offices, they were dismissed with disgrace.</P>
<P>However this did not discourage <HI>Elias</HI> (as in∣deed what will a hungry Monk?) from sending one <HI>Adam Camara,</HI> his pretended Arch-Deacon, to <HI>Rome,</HI> three Years after that misfortune; who, together with his Patriarch's Letter, delivered to the Pope a Book of his own composing, con∣cerning the Reconciliation of the <HI>Chaldaean</HI> Church to the <HI>Roman,</HI> which he desired might be dili∣gently examined. In his Letter he told <HI>Paul</HI> V. <HI>That let Hereticks do what they will, he for his part was resolved never to go against the Holy Precepts of
<PB N="15" REF="19"/> the Apostles and Orthodox Fathers, who had all af∣firmed the</HI> See <HI>of great</HI> Rome <HI>to be the Head of all other</HI> Sees, <HI>but would always confess that the</HI> Roman <HI>Church was the Mother of all the other Churches in the World, and that all that did not own her to be so, were accursed.</HI> It's observable, that this <HI>Elias</HI> had a stretch of Courtship beyond his begging Predecessors; which was his assuring the Pope, That all their Clergy anciently had their Orders immediately from <HI>Rome,</HI> and that that Custom continued, till several that were going to <HI>Rome</HI> on that Errand were murdered by the way; which having several times happened, the Pope when he came to hear of it, did of his free Grace say, <HI>Let us ordain them a Patriarch; and not only so, but permit them to chuse him, that so they may not perish thus by the way:</HI> And thus, said good <HI>Elias,</HI> we received all the Authority we pretend to from <HI>Rome,</HI> and not from our selves, as they pretend to do; (and the greater Wretches they) who trample upon the Canons of the Apostles, and the Laws of the Fathers. It is from this blind Story that the <HI>Roman</HI> Doctors have endea∣voured to persuade the World, that all the <HI>Ba∣bylonish</HI> Bishops do own, that they derived their Power of Ordination from the <HI>Western</HI> Fathers, meaning the Bishops of <HI>Rome,</HI> no doubt.</P>
<P>Now what crude Stuff is this, that those hun∣gry. Monks served up to the Pope, and was as greedily swallowed at <HI>Rome,</HI> there being not the least Colour of Truth in any part of the Story. For as to the ancient Custom that is so confident∣ly
<PB N="16" REF="20"/> affirmed, it is plainly contradicted by the 33d <HI>Arabick</HI> Canon of the Council of <HI>Nice,</HI> which tho' not the genuine Canons of that Council, are yet very ancient. The Canon runs thus:
<Q><HI>Canon 33.</HI> Let the See of <HI>Seleucia,</HI> which is one of the <HI>Eastern</HI> Cities, be honoured likewise, and have the Title of <HI>Catholicon,</HI> and let the Prelate thereof, ordain Arch-Bishops as the o∣ther Patriarchs do, that so the <HI>Eastern</HI> Chri∣stians who live under Heathens, may not be wronged by waiting the Patriarch of <HI>Antioch</HI>'s leisure, or by going to him, but may have a way opened to them to supply their own Necessities; neither will any injury be done to the Patriarch of <HI>Antioch</HI> thereby, seeing he has consented to its being thus, upon the Synod's having desired it of him.</Q></P>
<P>From which Canon it is plain, That the Church of <HI>Seleucia</HI> or <HI>Babylon</HI> was anciently subject to the Patriarch of <HI>Antioch,</HI> who of all the Patriarchs was their nighest Neighbour. So that if the <HI>Chal∣daean</HI> Bishops do own that they derived all their Authority from the <HI>Western</HI> Fathers, as is pre∣tended they do, they must mean by the <HI>Western</HI> Fathers, the Bishops of <HI>Antioch.</HI></P>
<P>And as to its being said, That the <HI>Chaldaean</HI> Bi∣shops do to this day own that they had their Or∣dinations from the <HI>Western</HI> Fathers, meaning the Bishops of <HI>Rome,</HI> the falshood of that Pretence appears evidently, not only from what has been
<PB N="17" REF="20"/> said, but from the whole Tenor of the following Synod, and of all the late Reports of the <HI>Por∣tuguezes</HI> concerning that Church: As it does like∣wise, That all those Patriarchs of <HI>Babylon,</HI> who came to <HI>Rome,</HI> notwithstanding the great Noise they made in this Part of the World, were mere Impostors, never owned by the Churches they pre∣tended to be Patriarchs of. Father <HI>Simon</HI> speak∣ing of this in the 93 Page of his <HI>Histoire Critique,</HI> confesseth their magnifying the Pope's Power as they did, to have been a piece of gross Flattery, but withal, will have it to have been Pardonable in such poor Wretches, who would not other∣wise have been suffered to have approached the Pope, to whom they came into <HI>Europe</HI> on purpose to make their Court; for, as he observes upon the same occasion, few or none of the Oriental Prelates ever applied themselves to the Pope, but for the promoting of some particular Interest, which was one reason why the reunions they pre∣tended to make did not last long. But tho' for some time these <HI>mock Prelates</HI> being supported by the Pope, made a shift to keep the face of a Church at <HI>Charamet,</HI> none of them ever daring to go to <HI>Mosul,</HI> yet after a little time the true <HI>Chal∣daean</HI> Prelates obliged them to leave <HI>Charamet;</HI> from whence they retired to <HI>Zeinalback,</HI> a yet remoter Place on the borders of <HI>Persia,</HI> where from little, in a short time, they dwindled to nothing.</P>
<P>The Prelates of <HI>Babylon</HI> we see were anciently stiled Bishops of <HI>Seleucia,</HI> a City not far from
<PB N="18" REF="21"/> <HI>Ctesiphon;</HI> from whence it was that <HI>Simon,</HI> who suffered Martyrdom under <HI>Sapor</HI> is stiled Bishop of <HI>Seleucia</HI> and <HI>Ctesiphon,</HI> of which City we meet with this following Account in <HI>Strabo.</HI> Babylon <HI>was anciently the Metropolis of</HI> Assyria, <HI>which now</HI> Seleucia <HI>of</HI> Tigris <HI>is, near to which is a great Village called</HI> Ctesiphon, <HI>where the Kings of</HI> Parthia <HI>used to spend the Winter to spare</HI> Seleucia, <HI>that it might not be continually oppressed with Soldiers and</HI> Scythi∣ans: <HI>but notwithstanding this Change of the Metro∣polis, as the Country all about is still called</HI> Babylon, <HI>so the Natives, tho' Born in the very City of</HI> Seleucia, <HI>are still called</HI> Babylonians <HI>from the Region, and not</HI> Seleucians.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Bibliotheca Patrum,</HI> there is a Treatise of Paradise translated out of <HI>Syriack</HI> into <HI>Latine,</HI> by <HI>Masius,</HI> writ by one <HI>Moses Bar Cepha,</HI> who is stiled Bishop in <HI>Bethraman</HI> and <HI>Bethleno,</HI> and <HI>Cu∣rator of the Ecclesiastical Affairs of the Mozul</HI> or <HI>Seleucia Parthorum.</HI> This <HI>Moses</HI> flourished in the Tenth Century.</P>
<P>But it is time to leave these <HI>Sham Prelates,</HI> who run so fast to <HI>Rome</HI> of their own accord, and re∣turn to the true ones, who were forc'd to go thi∣ther much against their Wills.</P>
<P>After the Christians of the <HI>Serra</HI> had heard of their Arch-Bishop's being sent a Prisoner to <HI>Por∣tugal,</HI> despairing of ever seeing him again, they sent secretly to <HI>Mar Simeon,</HI> Patriarch of <HI>Baby∣lon,</HI> desiring him to order them a new Arch-Bi∣shop, who straightways sent them one <HI>Mar Abra∣ham,</HI> who having gotten into the <HI>Serra</HI> in a dis∣guise,
<PB N="19" REF="21"/> notwithstanding the great care the <HI>Portu∣guezes</HI> had taken to have intercepted him, he was received by the whole Church as their Bi∣shop, with great joy. But he had not been long there, before he had the news of <HI>Mar Joseph</HI>'s being returned to <HI>Goa,</HI> where having presented the Letters he had brought along with him, he was permitted to go back to his Bishoprick.</P>
<P>The Arch-Bishop of <HI>Goa</HI> who had writ to <HI>Portugal,</HI> that they should by no means ever suf∣fer <HI>Mar Joseph</HI> to return to the <HI>Indies,</HI> was not without strong jealousies of his having prevari∣cated in all that he had promised; and what did very much confirm him therein, was, that <HI>Mar Jo∣seph</HI> when he desired him to take some Friars a∣long with him to preach the <HI>Roman</HI> Doctrines in his Bishoprick, did not only deny to do it, but furthermore pretended, that it was reveal'd to him the Night before, that it was no ways convenient. The Arch-Bishop being netled at this pretence, told him with great heat, That he had better Revelation from the Scriptures of his not being the Pastor whom God would have to feed his Sheep, but a Wolf in Sheep's cloathing, of whom our Saviour had said, <HI>That they were to be known by their Fruits,</HI> and that their <HI>Highnesses</HI> would quickly be sensible how much they had been imposed upon by him.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all this, he was permitted to go to his Bishoprick, tho' for no other reason, its like, but to give birth to a Schism, by which means the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> hoped to be able to com∣pass
<PB N="20" REF="22"/> their ends upon that Church the easier, <HI>Divide &amp; impera,</HI> being a piece of Policy that is well understood, and has been much practi∣sed by the <HI>Roman</HI> Church. And if this was their drift in sending him back to his Diocess, they were not out in their Policy, for <HI>Mar Joseph</HI> was not sooner in the <HI>Serra,</HI> than the whole Bi∣shoprick was divided, some adhering to <HI>Mar A∣braham,</HI> and others to <HI>Mar Joseph,</HI> as their true Prelate.</P>
<P>But <HI>Mar Joseph</HI> finding <HI>Mar Abraham</HI>'s Party to be much the more numerous, by reason of the Communication he had had with the <HI>La∣tins,</HI> did thereupon betake himself to the course that all distressed People, who preferr their own Interest to that of the Publick, take, and com∣plains to the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> of <HI>Mar Abraham,</HI> not only as an Usurper, but as a most bitter Enemy to the <HI>Roman</HI> Church.</P>
<P>The <HI>Viceroy,</HI> who was glad of this occasion, straightways dispatch'd an Order to the Governour of <HI>Cochim,</HI> to have <HI>Mar Abraham</HI> apprehended, and to send him Prisoner to <HI>Goa,</HI> in order to send him to <HI>Rome,</HI> which was executed accor∣dingly. But the Ship whereon <HI>Mar Abraham</HI> was Embarked, being forced by stress of Weather into <HI>Mazambique,</HI> a Port belonging to the <HI>Portu∣guezes</HI> in the Southern Coasts of <HI>Africk,</HI> he made a shift to escape, and by the way of <HI>Melindo</HI> and <HI>Ormus,</HI> to get to the Patriarch of <HI>Babylon,</HI> from whom having received new Briefs to Fortifie his Title, he resolved to return to his Bishoprick;
<PB N="21" REF="22"/> but having afterwards considered better on the matter, and being sensible, that if he went thi∣ther without the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Order, that the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> would quickly make the Serra too hot for him, he altered his Mind, and resolved to try his For∣tune at <HI>Rome,</HI> and to take a Journey thither over Land; being come to <HI>Rome,</HI> after having abju∣red his ancient Faith, and reconciled himself to the Church, and promised to reduce that of <HI>Ma∣labar</HI> to its obedience, he obtained of <HI>Pius</HI> the Fourth, all such <HI>Briefs</HI> as were any ways neces∣sary, having also the Title of <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> which he and his Predecessors had enjoyed, given him therein.</P>
<P>But being at <HI>Venice,</HI> in his way home, the Di∣vines there discovering, as it is said, both from the Nature of the Opinions that he had abjured, and from his own Confession, that he had never been lawfully Ordained, did oblige him to re∣ceive all <HI>Orders,</HI> from the <HI>first tonsure</HI> to the <HI>Priesthood.</HI> He was ordained <HI>Priest</HI> by the Bi∣shop of <HI>St. Salvador</HI> and Consecrated a <HI>Bishop</HI> by the Patriarch of <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Venetian</HI> Consecration, if it is not a down∣right <HI>Naggs-Head</HI> Story, is a Scurvy reflection upon the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Infallibility, who herein was not only deceived in a <HI>matter of Fact,</HI> in giving <HI>Briefs</HI> to one, as an Arch-Bishop, who really was not at all in <HI>Holy Orders,</HI> but he must also have been deceived in a <HI>matter of Doctrine,</HI> in being Igno∣rant, that some of the Opinions which had been Abjured before him by <HI>Mar Abraham,</HI> were of
<PB N="22" REF="23"/> such a nature as to incapacitate him for <HI>Orders.</HI></P>
<P>While <HI>Mar Abraham</HI> was in this Voyage, <HI>Mar Joseph</HI> finding himself in the quiet Possession of his whole Bishoprick, did not forbear to profess and teach the Doctrines he had abjured in <HI>Portu∣gal.</HI> The Bishop of <HI>Cochim,</HI> who was his next Neighbour, having heard thereof, acquainted the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Goa</HI> therewith, and he <HI>Don Anrique,</HI> the Cardinal Infante, who at that time Governed <HI>Portugal</HI> in the Minority of his Nephew <HI>Don Sebastian,</HI> and the Cardinal informed the Pope of the whole matter.</P>
<P>These repeated Tyrannies of the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> in the <HI>Indies,</HI> of dragging ancient Bishops thus out of their own Country and Diocess, and tumbling them so about the World, I cannot but reckon among those violent Injustices for which <HI>Manuel de Faria</HI> in the very last words of his <HI>Asia Portu∣guesa,</HI> tells us, God has punished them so visibly.

Now, that no∣thing that's considerable of all these vast Treasures, should any where appear, must be for one or both of these two Reasons, first, that whereas God permitted the Discovery of this Voyage, only for the propogation of his Name, and true Worship <HI>(but not by such barbarous Methods as the forementioned I dare say)</HI> these Travellers have, for the most part, pursued the ends of a Sacrilegious Covetousness, committing many Injustices to fill their Coffers, instead of having
<PB N="24" REF="24"/> any regard to Religion; the other is, because the most of those Riches were gained by the unjust means of Tyrannies, Robberies, and all sort of Insolencies, of which you have many Instances in the foregoing Hi∣story.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Pius</HI> V. upon this Issued forth a <HI>Brief,</HI> bear∣ing date the 15th. of <HI>January</HI> 1567. directing it to <HI>Dom Jorge,</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Goa,</HI> and com∣manding him to use all diligence to have <HI>Mar Joseph</HI> forthwith Apprehended and sent to <HI>Rome,</HI> in pursuance whereof he was seized, and sent Prisoner to <HI>Portugal,</HI> upon the first Ships that went, whence he was carried to <HI>Rome,</HI> where he died.</P>
<P>Neither were the Violences they made use of to Convert <HI>Infidels,</HI> any whit inferior to those they exercised upon the poor <HI>Chaldaean</HI> Christians, by which they came to provoke the <HI>Infidel</HI> Princes to that degree, that they had like to have lost all that they had in the <HI>Indies</HI> by it. For the <HI>Hidal∣caon</HI> who Besieged <HI>Goa</HI> in the Year 1570. both in his Letters to the Viceroy <HI>Don Luis d' Ataide,</HI> and in the Speech he made to his Captains, when he first communicated to them his design of dri∣ving the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> out of the <HI>Indies,</HI> gave those Violences for the chief cause of his War. Those Letters and Speech being too long to be here Inserted, I shall only set down so much of them as relates directly to this matter.</P>
<P>In his first Letter to the <HI>Viceroy,</HI> after having complained of some other Grievances, he tells him, <HI>That he was certainly informed that at</HI> Ormus,
<PB N="25" REF="24"/> Dio, Chaul, <HI>and all the other</HI> Portugueze <HI>Ports, his Subjects Ships were all strictly searched, and all the Boys and Girls that were found Aboard, of what∣soever Quality,</HI> Abyssnes <HI>or</HI> Mahometans, <HI>were forcibly carried ashoar, and there detained from their Parents or Masters. This,</HI> saith he, <HI>is a matter that I cannot but be extreamly offended with; neither can I judge otherwise of your permitting such Violences, but that you have a mind to break with me, for if you had not I cannot be perswaded that your People durst presume to commit such Insolencies:</HI> He goes on. <HI>Let it suffice that no difference can happen be∣tween us, but what gives me great displeasure, and that I am both a Brother and an Allie of the King of</HI> Portugal, <HI>and do esteem you as my particular Friend, to put a stop to this matter, that so my Subjects may have no further cause to complain thereof. Besides, I am confident the King of</HI> Portugal <HI>will not thank any, that shall be instrumental in making a Breach between me and him, by compelling my Subjects thus against their Wills to turn Christians, a practice,</HI> saith he, <HI>that's abominable in the sight of all the World; nay, I am confident that</HI> Jesus Christ <HI>himself, the God whom you adore, cannot be well pleased with such Service as this: Force and Compulsion in all such Cases, being what God, Kings, and all the People of the World do abominate. The work of turning People from one Religion to another, if it be not done by the Divine Inspiration, and the immediate Will of God can ne∣ver be sincere, neither can</HI> Converts <HI>have any in∣ward respect for a Religion, which they are com∣pelled to Profess. I do thetefore intreat you to see
<PB N="26" REF="25"/> that this matter be speedily redressed, but especially that of taking Peoples Children from them by violence, which is a thing I stand amazed at, and am in duty bound to see remedied.</HI></P>
<P>In his second Letter he thanks the <HI>Viceroy</HI> for an Order he had sent to <HI>Ormus,</HI> and the other <HI>Portugueze</HI> Ports, prohibiting all such Violences, but at the same time tells him, <HI>That his Order was not in the least regarded; for that the</HI> Portuguezes <HI>notwithstanding it, went on still in their former Courses,</HI> to which he tells him, <HI>If there were not a speedy and effectual stop put, it must necessarily be∣get a War betwixt him and the</HI> Portuguezes; adding, <HI>That as he knew that neither God, nor wise Kings, took any delight in Discords, so he was certain that there was no Religion in the World, that justified the forcing of People from one Religion to ano∣ther.</HI></P>
<P>And in his Speech to his Captains he tells them, <HI>The</HI> Portuguezes <HI>at first came among us, under the notion of Merchants, promising to help us to several Goods that we wanted, but that afterwards by making of trifling Presents to some weak Princes and other Arts, they had obtained leave to build Store-Houses for their Wares upon the Coast; but that instead of Ware-Houses, they had built Fortresses, by which means they had strengthned themselves so in</HI> India, <HI>both by Sea and Land, that it was more than time for the Natives to look about them, and to join to∣gether to extirpate such cruel Tyrants and Ravagers of so many Kingdoms, and Enemies to the general quiet and commerce of the World; and that for one
<PB N="27" REF="25"/> thing especially, which was what no patience was able to endure, their compelling the</HI> Indians <HI>in all places, where they had Power, to change their Religion.</HI></P>
<P>In this Affair the <HI>Christian</HI> and <HI>Mahometan,</HI> of which Sect this <HI>Hidalcaon</HI> was, seem to have changed Parts, the <HI>Mahometan</HI> writing therein like a <HI>Christian,</HI> and the <HI>Christians</HI> behaving them∣selves like <HI>Mahometans.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Pudet haec opprobria nobis</L>
<L>Vel dici potuisse.</L></Q>
<P>About this time the <HI>Dominican Friars,</HI> under pretence of building a Convent, built a Fortress at <HI>Solor,</HI> into which, as soon as it was finished, the <HI>Viceroy</HI> put a strong Garrison: There were perpetual Bickerings betwixt this Garrison and the Natives, in most of which, some of the <HI>Friars,</HI> as they were Converting those <HI>Infidels,</HI> with Swords in their hands, suffered Martyrdom.</P>
<P>We read of a famous <HI>Portugueze Missionary</HI> about this time, it was one <HI>Fernando Vinagre,</HI> who, tho' a Secular Priest, Commanded the Squadron that was sent to the assistance of the King of <HI>Ti∣dore;</HI> in which occasion he is said to have be∣haved himself both like a great Captain, and a great Apostle, and to have appeared one day in <HI>Armour,</HI> and another in a <HI>Surplice,</HI> and to have Baptized several in his Armour, with his <HI>Surplice</HI> over it. In these <HI>a la Dragoon</HI> Conversions, he was seconded by his Admiral <HI>Antonio Galvam,</HI> who with the assistance of Captain <HI>Francisco de
<PB N="28" REF="26"/> Castro,</HI> is said to have Converted five Kings in the Island of <HI>Mazacar;</HI> and tho' he was really no other than a <HI>St. Ruth,</HI> yet he is said by the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Historians to be another <HI>St. Paul,</HI> in Governing all that came under his Power both with his Sword and with his Voice, <HI>A Sword and Voice,</HI> say they, <HI>worthy of a glorious Eternity.</HI> It was this <HI>Antonio</HI> that first discovered the King of <HI>Portugal</HI>'s special Title to the <HI>Clove,</HI> which, for having five Points, he said, had the King of <HI>Portugal</HI>'s Arms, which are the five Wounds of Christ stamp'd upon it.</P>
<P>The same Author tells us, and approves of what an <HI>Indian</HI> said of the <HI>Portuguezes,</HI> when in the height of their Triumphs: <HI>Let them alone,</HI> said the <HI>Indian, for they will quickly come to lose that as Covetous Merchants, which they have gained as admirable Soldiers; they now Conquer</HI> Asia, <HI>but it will not be long before</HI> Asia <HI>will Conquer them.</HI></P>
<P>The Emperor of <HI>Persia</HI> is reported by the same Author to have made the same Prediction, who being told by the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Ambassador, when he asked him how many of the Governours of the <HI>Indies</HI> Heads his Master had chopped off, that he had not taken off one, replied, <HI>If that is true, it is not possible the</HI> Portuguezes <HI>should hold the</HI> Indies <HI>long.</HI></P>
<P>About this time the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> were driven out of the Island of <HI>Ito</HI> by the <HI>Natives.</HI> They were stirred up to do it by a Speech made by one <HI>Gemulio,</HI> a considerable <HI>Native,</HI> wherein he told the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> in a full Assembly of them, <HI>That if they Preached to others that there was a God
<PB N="29" REF="26"/> in Heaven, who observed all that was done on Earth, and would certainly Reward all Good, and Punish all Evil-Deeds, without believing it themselves, or without practising what they believed, they were cer∣tainly guilty of the Abomination, which such a God must detest above all others:</HI> He likewise told them, <HI>They were Strangers come from the very Skirts of the World, and will you,</HI> saith he, <HI>who are the Off∣spring of the Shades, which the Sun leaves when it goes down, presume to Tyrannize over us, who enter∣tained you so kindly, and have been so long a San∣ctuary to you? If these be the Customs of your Coun∣try, you must know they are what we Abominate; return, return therefore to your native darkness, or your ancient Habitations, where the want of Light will hide your Actions, and do you not come hither to commit them in the very apple of the Eye of the Sun, as it riseth out of his brightest Cradle. You preach</HI> Christ Crucified <HI>to us, and at the same time Crucifie those you have perswaded to believe in him. You will make others to be</HI> Christians, <HI>without ap∣pearing to be such your selves. You must know we are not ignorant of what you have done to the King of</HI> Xael, <HI>and how you rewarded his great kindness and Civility to you, with Violences and Outrages, and his Subjects good turns with dishonouring their Wives: We know likewise how you have used the Queen of</HI> Aram, <HI>whom, after she had lost both her Kingdom and Husband to secure you, you have dishonourably thrown off, as one who could be of no further use to you. Be gone therefore immediately out of this Island, and hereafter don't you presume to
<PB N="30" REF="27"/> set your Foot, or so much as cast your Eye upon it.</HI> The Historian who relates this, tho' a <HI>Portugueze,</HI> makes this reflection upon it, <HI>Thus we lose Places by our Insolencies, which we gained by our Valour.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Mar Abraham</HI> returned to <HI>Goa</HI> over Land, by the way of <HI>Ormus,</HI> and found <HI>Mar Joseph</HI> Shipped off for <HI>Portugal,</HI> thereupon he flattered himself with the hopes of meeting with nothing to molest him in the Possession of his Bishoprick; but he quickly found himself decei∣ved, for having presented the Pope's <HI>Briefs,</HI> and other Papers he brought along with him to the Arch-Bishop, the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> not having the same reason to permit him to return to the <HI>Serra,</HI> as they had when they permitted <HI>Mar Joseph,</HI> which, as I have observed, was done on purpose to give rise to a Schism, he was told, that before they would put him in Possession of his Bishoprick, they must first have both the <HI>Briefs</HI> and his <HI>Infor∣mations</HI> strictly examined, that so they might be satisfied he had not imposed upon his <HI>Holiness.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore, tho' resolved whatever came on't, never to let <HI>Mar Abraham</HI> go out of their hands, yet that they might not seem to refuse to pay a due respect to the <HI>Pope's Briefs;</HI> the Arch-Bishop and others, after having examined all his Papers, found several flaws in them, which were declared to be sufficient to justifie their detaining of him: This is no more than what the <HI>Canonists</HI> can do, and do daily in the clearest cases, it being impos∣sible to have any Matrimonial or other cause drawn up, or worded so accurately, that the <HI>Canonists,</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="27"/> and especially if the Pope desire it, will not find several Nullities in. Upon the publication of the nullity of the <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Briefs,</HI> as having been obtained by misinformation, poor <HI>Mar Abraham,</HI> instead of being sent back in Triumph to his Bishoprick, as he expected, was, after all the Pains he had been at, confined to the <HI>Dominican</HI> Convent at <HI>Goa,</HI> there to remain till such time as the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Answer came to the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI>'s In∣formation of his Case.</P>
<P><HI>Mar Abraham,</HI> being sensible that to be con∣fined till that came, was the same thing as to be condemned to be a Prisoner for Life, resolved, let what would be the Issue, to try to make his escape, which, after several unsuccessful Attempts, he did, at last, upon an <HI>Holy Thursday</HI> at Night, while the <HI>Friars</HI> were all imployed in the Chapel, and having gotten over to the Continent, he posted away to <HI>Malabar,</HI> where he was received with great Joy and Festivity by all the Christians, who having two of their Arch-Bishops Prisoners among the <HI>Portuguezes,</HI> despaired of ever seeing another <HI>Babylonish</HI> Bishop among them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Viceroy</HI> and <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> were much trou∣bled at <HI>Mar Abraham</HI>'s having made his escape thus, and writ straightways to the Bishop of <HI>Cochim,</HI> and all the Governours upon the Coast of <HI>Mala∣bar,</HI> to have him apprehended if he was above Ground; but <HI>Mar Abraham</HI> knowing how it would be, took care to keep himself, as far as he could, out of their reach, never adventuring to visit any of the Churches that were in the Neigh∣bourhood
<PB N="32" REF="28"/> of <HI>Cochim,</HI> or of any other <HI>Portugueze</HI> Garrison.</P>
<P>But tho' after this <HI>Mar Abraham</HI> is said, in all his Letters to the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> to have still profes∣sed himself a <HI>Romanist,</HI> and not only so, but to have re-ordained all that had been ordained by him formerly; yet it is certain, that in all things else he acted quite otherwise in his Diocess, where he continued not only to preach his old <HI>Doctrines,</HI> but in his Prayers still named the Bi∣shop of <HI>Babylon</HI> as his Patriarch.</P>
<P><HI>Gregory</HI> XIII. being informed of this by the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> of <HI>Goa,</HI> and other Prelates of the <HI>Indies,</HI> issued forth a <HI>Brief,</HI> bearing date the 28th. of <HI>November,</HI> 1578. directing it to <HI>Mar Abraham,</HI> and commanding him therein to re∣pair to the next Provincial Council that should be Assembled at <HI>Goa,</HI> to assist at it, and to ob∣serve all the Decrees that should be made therein, relating to his Bishoprick, and that he might not excuse his not obeying this <HI>Brief,</HI> by pretending that he could not do it with safety; the <HI>Pope</HI> like∣wise sent him <HI>Letters of safe Conduct,</HI> to go and come without being any ways molested.</P>
<P>In pursuance whereof <HI>Dom Vicente da Fonseca,</HI> a <HI>Friar,</HI> of the Order of <HI>St. Dominick,</HI> and <HI>Arch-Bishop of Goa,</HI> having called a Provincial Council, which was the third of <HI>Goa,</HI> ordered the forementioned <HI>Brief</HI> to be intimated to <HI>Mar Abraham,</HI> and together with the <HI>Pope</HI>'s, his own, and the Viceroy's <HI>Letters of safe Conduct,</HI> to be sent to him.</P>
<PB N="33" REF="28"/>
<P><HI>Mar Abraham,</HI> having well considered the matter, and perceiving how difficult it would be for him to escape being Dragoon'd by the <HI>Portuguezes,</HI> whose power increased daily in those Parts, if he should disobey this Summons, deter∣mined, whatever came on it, to repair to the Council, at which he assisted, and was obliged once more to Abjure, and make a profession of the <HI>Roman</HI> Faith, promising withal, to see all the Decrees made in that <HI>Synod,</HI> in relation to his Bishoprick, punctually executed, and to send in all the Heretick Books in his Diocess to be burn∣ed or amended; and having confessed, that in <HI>the Ordination of Priests</HI> there was no Wine in the Cup, which he delivered into their hands, toge∣ther with the Host, he was commanded to Or∣dain all that he had Ordained before over-again.</P>
<P>Now if this, of there being no Wine in the Cup, which was delivered into the hands of those who were Ordained <HI>Priests,</HI> was the only ground whereon the <HI>Romanists</HI> founded the in∣validity of the <HI>Chaldaean</HI> Orders, as it is the only thing they have been pleased to instance in, what a stretch was this to invalidate the Orders of a whole Church by? But for <HI>Canonists</HI> and <HI>School∣men</HI> by Subtilties invented on purpose to support a late Error, or to serve a present turn, to wound Christianity in its very Vitals, is a practice too common to be wondred at. I am sure the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> has much more reason to apprehend that the Sacrilege of denying the Cup to the Laity
<PB N="34" REF="29"/> in the Sacrament, may make her Communion im∣perfect and ineffectual, than that this alone should make Ordinations so.</P>
<P>But after all this stir, the Doctrine of the deli∣vering the Bread and Cup into the hands of those who are to be ordained Priests, being es∣sential to Orders, is so far from being true, that it is owned to be a Novelty by all the Modern Learned Divines of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and is moreover contradicted by her daily Practice, who, as all the World knows, allows the <HI>Greek Orders</HI> to be good, in the Collation whereof she knows, the Bread and Cup is not put into the hands of those who are ordained Priests.</P>
<P>It is true, the Council of <HI>Florence,</HI> in her In∣structions to the <HI>Armenians,</HI> seems to have doted into the same Error with this of the <HI>Portuguezes,</HI> in making that new Ceremony essential to <HI>Orders.</HI> But let that be as it will, it is certain that both the present practice of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, and all her truly Learned <HI>Sons,</HI> the Modern <HI>Schoolmen</HI> not excepted, do condemn it as an Error; for which I shall only quote two of her most emi∣nent Schoolmen, and one of her ablest Criticks.</P>
<P>Cardinal <HI>Lugo,</HI> in his 2 Disp. <HI>de Sacramentis,</HI> saith as followeth, <HI>Aliunde autem habemus, non porrectionem panis &amp; vini determinatè requiri ex divinâ institutione, cum Graeci absque illâ porrecti∣one ordinentur; ergo fatendum est Christum solum voluisse pro materiâ aliquod signum proportionatum hoc vel illud.</HI></P>
<PB N="35" REF="29"/>
<P>And <HI>Becanus,</HI> in the third part of his Scho∣lastical Divinity, <HI>Chap.</HI> 26. of the Sacrament of Order, has as follows: <HI>Concilium Florentinum in instructione Armenorum solum meminit materiae acci∣dentalis, quae ab Ecclesiâ fuit instituta,</HI> which was the delivering of the Bread and Cup, <HI>non autem substantialis, quam Christus praescripsit,</HI> which is the imposition of hands, <HI>Quia haec ex Scripturis &amp; antiquis Patribus erat satis cognita, non autem illa. Addo, si hoc argumentum valeret, posse optimè retor∣queri ita, Antiqua concilia non assignant aliam ma∣teriam nisi impositionem manuum, ergo,</HI> &amp;c. He con∣cludes thus, <HI>Nota antiqua concilia assignâsse mate∣riam à Christo institutam, Florentinum verò mate∣am assignâsse, quam Ecclesia introduxit,</HI> that is the <HI>Latin</HI> only. By this one may see, that the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> is not so uniform a Body as she pretends to be, being thus inconsistent with her self in a thing of so high a nature, as that, <HI>of what is,</HI> and <HI>what is not essential to Orders:</HI> and we my see likewise, how she will break thorow all ancient Doctrines and Rules, rather than not disgrace all Bodies of Christians, which deny her Obedience, by unchurching them by some subtilty or other; and indeed, thorow the clearest evidences of matter of Fact, as she does in the case of the Or∣ders of the <HI>Church of England.</HI> And further∣more, how apt she is to look upon her own novel Inventions as the main Substantials of Re∣ligion.</P>
<P>To whom I shall only add <HI>Morinus,</HI> whose judgment in a case of this nature is of more
<PB N="36" REF="30"/> weight, than that of the whole Tribe of School∣men. Who in the 1 <HI>Chap.</HI> of his first Exercitati∣on, <HI>De Sacris Ordinationibus,</HI> saith, <HI>Nemo, ut mi∣hi videtur, dubitare potest, antiquos Latinos, à quibus accepimus &amp; Ordinationes, &amp; quod sacerdo∣tes sumus, legitimè &amp; validè sacerdotes consecrasse, &amp; caetera sacrarum Ordinationum munia contulisse: Eadem antiquorum Graecorum ratio.

<P>The Council being ended, <HI>Mar Abraham</HI> re∣turned to his Bishoprick, where he observed no∣thing of what he had promised and swore, save that of ordaining his Priests again the third time, at which Ordinations there were several <HI>Jesuites,</HI> who were skilled in the <HI>Syriack</HI> Tongue, that as∣sisted to see that nothing was omitted that was essential.</P>
<P>Not long after a Letter of <HI>Mar Abraham</HI> to the Patriarch of <HI>Babylon</HI> was intercepted, wherein he informed him of his having been at a Council of the Bishops of the <HI>Indies</HI> at <HI>Goa,</HI> whither he had gone purely out of fear of the <HI>Portuguezes, who,</HI> he said, <HI>were over his Head, is a Hammer over an Anvil:</HI> but when he was there, that he had delivered in a Profession of his Faith, which none of the <HI>Latin</HI> Bishops were able to contradict, professing
<PB N="38" REF="31"/> himself to his Patriarch a Dogmatist of the <HI>Chal∣daean</HI> Faith.</P>
<P><HI>Mar Abraham</HI> being grown ancient and very much broke, by the long and unintermitting Per∣secutions of the <HI>Portuguezes,</HI> was willing to have a <HI>Coadjutor</HI> from <HI>Babylon,</HI> who might, after his Death, also succeed him in his Bishoprick, and accordingly had one <HI>Mar Simeon</HI> sent to him by the Patriarch of <HI>Babylon.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mar Simeon</HI> was no sooner fixed in the <HI>Serra,</HI> but, finding the People, by reason of his never having had anything to do with the <HI>Latins,</HI> to have a much greater Affection for him than they had for <HI>Mar Abraham,</HI> who, tho' to his Sorrow, had been so much among them, he was encouraged to set up for sole Bishop, and having fixed his <HI>See</HI> at <HI>Carturte,</HI> one of the principal Towns of the Christians of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> was much favoured by the Queen of <HI>Pimenta,</HI> in whose Territories <HI>Car∣turte</HI> is.</P>
<P>These two Bishops fell presently to fulminate their Excommunications one against another, to the great disturbance of the whole Diocess, and <HI>Mar Abraham</HI> finding his Adversary to gain ground of him daily, complains of him to the Viceroy and Arch-Bishop of <HI>Goa,</HI> desiring them to drive <HI>Mar Simeon</HI> out of the <HI>Serra,</HI> who was not only an Intruder, but a bitter Enemy to the <HI>Latin</HI> Faith.</P>

<PB N="39" REF="31"/> resolved, if it were possible, to ease him of his Adversary, and understanding that it would be a difficult thing for him to get <HI>Mar Simeon</HI> into his hands by open force, he employed some <HI>Fran∣ciscan</HI> Friars to inveigle him with fair promises to go to <HI>Rome,</HI> and get the Pope's <HI>Brief</HI> for the Bi∣shoprick, without which he could never expect to enjoy it peaceably.</P>
<P><HI>Mar Simeon</HI> having first constituted one <HI>Jacob,</HI> a Parish Priest his <HI>Vicar General</HI> during his Ab∣sence, was perswaded by the Friars to go along with them to <HI>Cochim,</HI> from whence he was sent to <HI>Goa,</HI> and from <HI>Goa</HI> upon the first Ships to <HI>Por∣tugal,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Rome,</HI> where, after having been examined by the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> he was declared by Pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> V. not to be in Holy Orders, and was with that Sentence upon him sent by the Cardinal St. <HI>Severiana</HI> to <HI>Philip</HI> the Second, who put him into the hands of <HI>Dom Aleixo de Menezes,</HI> whom he was then sending to <HI>Goa,</HI> to be Arch-Bishop of that place.</P>
<P>Arch-Bishop <HI>Menezes,</HI> instead of carrying him along with him to the <HI>Indies,</HI> which was what <HI>Mar Simeon</HI> expected, confined him to a <HI>Franciscan</HI> Convent in <HI>Lisbon,</HI> from whence he is said to have wrote Letters by every Fleet, that went to the <HI>Indies</HI> to his Vicar-General <HI>Jacob,</HI> and in all his Letters to have still stiled himself <HI>Metropolitan of the Indies,</HI> and to have profess'd the <HI>Chaldaean</HI> Doctrines; these Letters were found by Arch-Bishop <HI>Menezes</HI> in the <HI>Serra,</HI> when he visited it, by whom they were sent to the chief Tribunal of
<PB N="40" REF="32"/> the General <HI>Inquisition</HI> of <HI>Portugal,</HI> where if they found <HI>Mar Simeon</HI> alive, they doubtless made him change his <HI>Franciscan</HI> Prison for that of the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> where they would take care he should write no more such Letters.</P>
<P><HI>Dom Matthias,</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Goa,</HI> having in the Year 1590. called another Provincial Coun∣cil, did, in conformity to <HI>Gregory</HI> XIII's <HI>Brief,</HI> Summon <HI>Mar Abraham</HI> to repair to it, who being sensible how ill he had complied with what he promised in the former Council, returned no o∣ther Answer to the Summons, but a Saying, which, he said, was a Proverb in his Country, <HI>That the Cat that bites a Snake is afraid of her Cord,</HI> inti∣mating thereby, that he durst not trust the <HI>Por∣tuguezes</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Bishops any more: After which he dissembled no longer, but in all things declared himself to be of the <HI>Chaldaean</HI> Faith.</P>
<P><HI>Clement</HI> VIII. being informed of all this, di∣spatched a <HI>Brief,</HI> bearing date the 27th. of <HI>January</HI> 1595. wherein he Commanded <HI>Dom Aleixo de Menezes,</HI> Arch-Bishop of <HI>Goa</HI> to make Inquisi∣tion into the Crimes and Errors of <HI>Mar Abraham,</HI> and in case he found him guilty of such things as he had been accused of, to have him apprehended and secured in <HI>Goa,</HI> as also to appoint a Gover∣nour or <HI>Vicar-Apostolical</HI> of the <HI>Roman</HI> Communi∣on over his Bishoprick, and upon <HI>Mar Abraham</HI>'s Death to take care that no Bishop coming from <HI>Babylon</HI> should be suffered to enter into the <HI>Serra</HI> to succeed.</P>
<PB N="41" REF="32"/>
<P>This Brief was delivered to the Arch-Bishop before he went to the <HI>Indies,</HI> by virtue whereof, and in obedience to the Pope's Commands, he made Inquisition into the Crimes and Errors of <HI>Mar Abraham,</HI> and finding him guilty of all that he had been accused of, he sent him his Process without Summoning him to appear at <HI>Goa,</HI> by reason of his having been Bed-rid for some time.</P>
<P>The Arch-Bishop furthermore understanding by the Informations he had taken, that <HI>Mar A∣braham,</HI> in conjunction with all the Christians of his Diocess, had sent to the Patriarch of <HI>Babylon</HI> for another <HI>Coadjutor,</HI> Commanded those of <HI>Ormus</HI> and of all other places that lay in the way, under grievous Censures, to stop all <HI>Chaldaean, Persian,</HI> or <HI>Armenian</HI> Ecclesiasticks that should come to∣wards the <HI>Indies</HI> without his Pass. This Order was so punctually executed, that one who came to <HI>Ormus</HI> with the Title of the Arch-Bishop of the <HI>Serra,</HI> was discovered in a disguise, and sent home again. There were several others of those Priests and Bishops who attempted to get into the <HI>Serra</HI> in the Habit of Mariners, were stopt, to the great Grief of the Christians of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> who, the more they saw their Clergy Persecuted, re∣spected them the more, and grew every day more zealous for their ancient Doctrines and Rites.</P>
<P>The Arch-Bishop being much encouraged by the Success of this diligence, laid the matter of the reduction of this Church to the obedience of the <HI>Roman,</HI> much more to Heart than any of his
<PB N="42" REF="33"/> Predecessors had ever done. The first he applied himself to was <HI>Jacob,</HI> whom <HI>Mar Simeon</HI> had left his <HI>Vicar General,</HI> to whom he writ a long Letter, passionately entreating him to throw away the Commission he had from <HI>Mar Simeon,</HI> who was Convicted at <HI>Rome</HI> of not being in Holy Orders, and to submit himself to the <HI>Papal Authority;</HI> making him large Promises of what he would do for him, if he complied with his desires. But <HI>Jacob,</HI> who died presently after, was deaf to all the Arch-Bishop could say to him, making it his whole business to enflame his Flock against the <HI>Latins,</HI> and their Doctrines.</P>
<P>The Arch-Bishop did not neglect at the same time to write earnestly to <HI>Mar Abraham,</HI> as also to the <HI>Arch-Deacon,</HI> who is the only <HI>Dignitary</HI> in that Church under the Bishop, and who is employed by him as his <HI>Vicar General,</HI> calling upon them to purge their Diocess of the Errors wherewith it had been so long infected, and to reduce it to the <HI>Roman</HI> Obedience.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Francis,</HI> about this time, destroyed a whole Fleet of <HI>Jores</HI> to the <HI>Portugueze,</HI> who, tho' he was not seen by any of the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> in the Fight, which was very bloody on both sides, yet a Cook who belonged to a <HI>Capuchin</HI> Convent not far off, having hid himself in the Ruines of their Church, saw a Friar in his own Habit Board the Fleet of <HI>Jores,</HI> one after another, whom he so terrified with his very look, as to put them all to flight immediately, and pursued them out of sight: This formidable Friar was afterwards
<PB N="43" REF="33"/> discovered to be St. <HI>Francis;</HI> but tho' the Histo∣rian has not been pleased to tell us how it came to be known certainly, he tells us it was an Acti∣on very proper for St. <HI>Francis,</HI> who was the lively Image of <HI>Christ,</HI> to appear thus and con∣found the Enemies of <HI>Christianity,</HI> by saying, <HI>It is I.</HI> Now, if this Story did not rebuild the <HI>Capuc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uined Church, the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> were not s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>atef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they use to be in such cases.

There were several <HI>Portuguezes,</HI> its true, fell in this Fight, but they must have been killed by something else than Fire-Arms, or at least than Cannon.</P>
<P>In the Year 1584. there came a famous <HI>Ama∣zon</HI> to <HI>Goa,</HI> who had been drove out of her Country by the <HI>Hidalcaon;</HI> her name was <HI>Abehi;</HI> she had Fought in several Battles to admiration; and tho' when she came to <HI>Goa,</HI> she was 62 years of Age, she is reported to have had a great deal of Wit, and the ruines of an exquisite Beauty; she pretended to have business of great moment to communicate to the Viceroy, but the Inqui∣sition, no body knew why, put a stop to the Ne∣gotiation; which, after having kept her Pri∣soner for some time, banished her to <HI>Ormus,</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="34"/> from whence having made her escape, she went to the Great <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Court.</P>
<P>In the Year 1593. the Bull of <HI>Cruzada</HI> was first brought into the <HI>Indies</HI> by <HI>Francisco Faria,</HI> a <HI>Dominican</HI> Friar; and indeed considering how great a Revenue that Bull is to the Pope in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> it is very much that it did not find its way into the <HI>Indies</HI> sooner.</P>
<P>When the Arch-Bishop was visiting the City of <HI>Damaon,</HI> he received Letters of the 16th. of <HI>Feb.</HI> 1597. from the Viceroy <HI>Matthias Dalbuquer∣que,</HI> advising him of the Death of <HI>Mar Abra∣ham.</HI> On the same day he received this news, he in obedience to the Pope's <HI>Brief,</HI> constituted <HI>Francisco Roz,</HI> a <HI>Jesuite,</HI> and who was afterwards made Bishop of the <HI>Serra,</HI> Governour and <HI>Vicar-Apostolical</HI> of the said Diocess.</P>
<P>The <HI>May</HI> following the Arch-Bishop being re∣turned to <HI>Goa,</HI> a Consultation was held about the Affairs of the Church of the <HI>Serra,</HI> where it was unanimously agreed; that notwithstanding the Pope in his <HI>Brief</HI> had commanded none to be made Governour or <HI>Vicar Apostolical</HI> of the Diocess, but what was of the <HI>Roman</HI> Communi∣on, it was convenient to nominate the present Arch-Deacon to it, which they did, joining <HI>Francisco Roz,</HI> and the <HI>Rector</HI> of the <HI>Jesuites</HI>-College of <HI>Vaipicotta,</HI> in Commission with him. But it being required of the Arch-Deacon, that he shou'd subscribe the Profession of Faith made by <HI>Pius</HI> IV. before he had his Patent he decli∣ned doing it, pretending he was not satisfied
<PB N="45" REF="34"/> with having two joyned with him in Com∣mission.</P>
<P>The Arch-Bishop, tho' he was sensible that it was the Subscription that stuck with him chiefly, thought fit to dissemble, so far as to seem to be∣lieve him, and by a new Patent constituted him the sole Governour of the Bishoprick.</P>
<P>The Arch-Deacon accepted of this Patent, but at the same time declared, That it gave him no Authority but what he had before; but when he was called upon to Subscribe the forementi∣oned Profession of Faith, he desired four Months to consider of it, hoping by that time a Bishop might be sent them by the Patriarch of <HI>Babylon,</HI> when the four Months were expired. Being ur∣ged a fresh to Subscribe, he told them flatly, that he would never do it, nor submit to the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, which he was sure had nothing to do with the Apostolical Church of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> no more than that of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> had to do with the <HI>Roman.</HI> And not being satisfied with having made this Declaration as to himself, he further∣more assembled a Synod of most of the Priests, and most substantial Christians at <HI>Angamale,</HI> the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of the Diocess, where they all swore to stand by their <HI>Arch-Deacon,</HI> in the defence of the ancient Faith they and their Fore-fathers had been bred up in, so as not to suffer the least alte∣ration to be made therein, nor ever to admit of any Bishop, but what should be sent them by the Patriarch of <HI>Babylon;</HI> of all which they made a publick Instrument, and having Sworn to main∣tain
<PB N="46" REF="35"/> it with their Lives and Fortunes, ordered it to be published thorow the whole Diocess.</P>
<P>After the meeting of this Synod, the Christi∣ans of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> came to be so far enraged against the <HI>Latins,</HI> for what they had done to destroy their ancient Faith, and for their having treated so many of their Arch-Bishops, so barbarously as they had done, that they would suffer no <HI>Latin</HI> Priest to officiate in their Churches, nor so much as to live among them. Two <HI>Jesuites,</HI> one at <HI>Angamale,</HI> and another at <HI>Carturte,</HI> having very narrowly escaped being murdered by them. The <HI>Jesuites,</HI> and other <HI>Latin</HI> Priests, were so far inti∣midated, by the fury that Synod had put that whole Christianity into, that for some time none of them were found so hardy, as to ven∣ture to go among them.</P>
<P>The news of this great and unexpected Heat, as it did strangely afflict the Arch-Bishop, who had set his Heart so much on the reducing of those Christians; so it was the thing that made him resolve to go in Person to the <HI>Serra</HI> to try what his Presence and Authority would do.</P>
<P>Not only the Viceroy, but the whole Clergy and Laity, and particularly the whole Chapter of <HI>Goa,</HI> together in a body, did all they could, as it is said, to disswade him from so dangerous an enterprise, but tho' he was deaf to all the Re∣monstrances of his Friends, yet upon a War breaking out suddenly in the Year 1598. betwixt the Kings of <HI>Mangate</HI> and <HI>Paru,</HI> in whose Ter∣ritories most of these Christian Churches stand,
<PB N="47" REF="35"/> he thought fit to put off his Journey for that Year, satisfying himself with writing a Letter to the Arch-Deacon to perswade him to reconcile him∣self and his Church to that of <HI>Rome,</HI> and acquaint∣ing him with his Intentions to visit all the Churches in the <HI>Serra</HI> in Person, so soon as the foremen∣tioned War was over, which he believed would be very speedily.</P>
<P>The Arch-Deacon, when he received this Let∣ter, dreading nothing so much as the Arch-Bi∣shop's coming in Person among them, declared that he had refused to Subscribe the forementi∣oned Profession of Faith, for no other reason, but because he was Commanded to do it before the Rector of the <HI>Jesuites</HI> College of <HI>Vaipicotta,</HI> with whom and his whole Order he pretended to be justly dissatisfied, giving the Arch-Bishop to understand at the same time, that if he would order any other Priest or Friar to take his Sub∣scription, that he was ready to make it.</P>
<P>But the Arch-Bishop looking upon this only as a Trick to throw an <HI>Odium</HI> upon the whole Order of <HI>Jesuites,</HI> and that for no other reason, but because they were the most industrious in the reduction of those Christians to the <HI>Roman</HI> Faith, would not comply with the Arch-Deacon's Re∣quest, in naming some body else to take his Sub∣scription; for which Conduct the Arch-Bishop was very much blamed, most People, and espe∣cially the other Orders of Friars murmuring a∣gainst him, as one grown so fond of the <HI>Jesuites,</HI> as to lose the reduction of so many thousand
<PB N="48" REF="36"/> Souls, rather than displease the <HI>Jesuites.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Jesuites,</HI> who sacrifice all Interests and Obligations to the Honour of their Order, have requited the Arch-Bishop but very ill for this his great kindness for them, in having re∣ported this Affair so here in <HI>Europe,</HI> as to rob him of that which he esteemed his chief Glory, to wit, the Reduction of this Church to the <HI>Roman</HI> Faith.</P>
<P>For in the History of the <HI>Jesuites</HI> in the <HI>Indies,</HI> published by <HI>Pieire du Jarri,</HI> a <HI>Jesuite,</HI> and prin∣ted at <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> in the Year 1608. we have all that is said by the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> of <HI>Mar Abraham,</HI> and his Arch-Deacon's great aversion to the <HI>Roman Church,</HI> and particularly to the whole Or∣der of <HI>Jesuites,</HI> flatly contradicted; for in that History we are told that <HI>Mar Abraham</HI> had such an extraordinary kindness for the <HI>Jesuites,</HI> that for some time before his Death, he put himself so entirely into their hands, as to be governed by them in all things; and that the Arch-Deacon <HI>George</HI> had such an high Opinion of their worth, as to declare to all the World, that without their aid and assistance, he should not know after the Arch-Bishop's Death, how to Govern the Diocess. It is furthermore said, that <HI>Mar Abraham,</HI> when he was upon his Death-bed called the Rector of the College of <HI>Vaipicotta</HI> to him, and having all his Clergy about him, declared, that he commit∣ted his Flock to the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> as the chief Pastor and Prelate of the whole Church, and Commanded the Arch-Deacon, and all his Priests,
<PB N="49" REF="36"/> to obey the <HI>Jesuites,</HI> whom his <HI>Holiness</HI> had sent to cultivate that Vineyard in all things, and to be sure to follow the Doctrines that they taught, which were the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; after which Charge he is said further∣more to have beseeched and conjured the Rector, by <HI>the love of Christ,</HI> and the <HI>great friendship</HI> there had been always between them, to take care of the Government of his Church after his Death, and to have ordered an authentick instrument to be made of all this to remain as a Testimony of his last Will, and of the Faith he died in.</P>
<P>The same History furthermore tells us, That this Church was so far reconciled to the Pope, in the Year, 1596. that when the <HI>Jubile</HI> of <HI>Clement</HI> VIII. was published among them by the <HI>Jesuites,</HI> they gave his <HI>Holiness</HI> a thousand Bles∣sings for it, and took a singular pleasure in pro∣nouncing his Name; and that during the whole time of the <HI>Jubile,</HI> they were at Church from Morning to Night, without taking any refection, and were so zealous to confess themselves to the Fathers, that they waited in the Church till Mid∣night in great Crowds to do it. Now accor∣ding to this report of things, the Arch-Bishop, when he came into the <HI>Serra,</HI> had little more to do than to open his Arms to embrace a People, who, being before hand prepared by the <HI>Jesuites,</HI> were ready to throw themselves into them.</P>
<P>But to leave Romance, and return to History, having only observed by the way, that it is vi∣sible from this gross misrepresentation of those
<PB N="50" REF="37"/> Affairs, how little regard is to be had to the <HI>Jesuites</HI> Reports of their Feats in the <HI>Indies;</HI> since to support a Story purely invented for the Honour of their Order, they do not boggle to pretend to have an authentick instrument of the truth of it, and that drawn up by the Order of a dying Prelate.</P>
<P>But a thing happened at this time, which, tho' in it self not considerable, did abundantly ma∣nifest how little disposed the Clergy of this Church was to submit to the <HI>Pope.</HI></P>
<P>A Boy, that went to School to the <HI>Jesuites</HI> at <HI>Vaipicotta,</HI> having been taught by them to name the Pope in his Prayers before the Patriarch of <HI>Babylon,</HI> being over-heard doing it in the Church by some of the <HI>Malabar</HI> Priests, was, after they had beat him severely, turned out of the Church; they spoke also to his Father to whip him out of pray∣ing for the Pope, who, they said, was none of their Prelate, nor had any thing to do with them. The Arch-Bishop being informed thereof, writ immediately to the Arch Deacon, commanding him to make Examples of those impudent He∣reticks, for what they had said and done to the Boy: which the Arch-Deacon was so far from doing, that he Honoured them the more for it. By the way, the <HI>Jesuites,</HI> teaching their Scho∣lars to pray for the Patriarch of <HI>Babylon,</HI> tho' after the Pope, is one instance, among others, of their Conscience, in those Parts, being subser∣vient to their Policy.</P>
<PB N="51" REF="37"/>
<P>But the World continuing still to blame the Arch-Bishop for not putting the Affairs of the <HI>Serra</HI> into some other hands than those of the <HI>Jesuites,</HI> against whose order that whole Church was so much incensed, he was obliged at last, tho' contrary to his Inclination, to send a <HI>Fran∣ciscan</HI> Friar to the Arch-Deacon, with authority to take his Subscription to the <HI>Roman</HI> Creed, and to require him to punish the Priests, who had beat the Boy for naming the Pope in his Pray∣ers.</P>
<P>The Arch-Deacon having nothing to object against the <HI>Franciscan</HI> Friar, and being extreamly desirous, if it was possible, to keep the Arch-Bishop from coming into the <HI>Serra,</HI> tho' he refu∣sed to Subscribe the Creed of <HI>Pius</HI> IV. yet con∣descended to Subscribe a Confession of Faith, wherein he professed himself a <HI>Catholick,</HI> and that he believed <HI>as the Church believed,</HI> but without naming the <HI>Roman,</HI> or acknowledging the Pope as universal Pastor of the Church; he is furthermore said, upon the Arch-Bishop's sig∣nifying his dissatisfaction at the ambiguous Pro∣fession he had made, to have given his consent publickly to that of <HI>Pius</HI> IV. being read to him in <HI>Portugueze,</HI> of which he did not understand a Syllable. But let that be as it will, it is cer∣tain that he continued still to teach, that the Pope was the head of his own Church, but had nothing to do with that of St. <HI>Thomas.</HI></P>
<PB N="52" REF="38"/>
<P>The Arch-Bishop not being able to brook such things any longer, fix'd a day for his going to∣wards the <HI>Serra,</HI> and when the Viceroy and the whole Clergy beg'd of him not to expose his Per∣son to such visible danger, they could have no other answer from him but this, <HI>That his life was but too secure in this case, seeing he had ne∣ver merited enough to entitle him to the Honour of being a Martyr.</HI> However, lest his Humility might deceive him in passing a Judgment upon himself, he did not think fit to trust too much to his want of Merits; and for that reason went attended with a good Guard, he had also a Com∣mission to treat with all the Princes of <HI>Malabar,</HI> about Peace and War, and particularly to en∣gage the <HI>Samorim</HI> to assist the <HI>Portugueze</HI> to take <HI>Cunahle,</HI> a Fortress lately possessed by a com∣pany of <HI>Mahometan</HI> Pyrates, who did very much disturb the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Trade upon that Coast. This Nest of Pyrates, was first built by one <HI>Pate Marca,</HI> a <HI>Mahometan,</HI> who having in a short time enriched it strangely with the Spoils of the <HI>Por∣tuguezes,</HI> both by Sea and Land, left it at his Death to his Nephew <HI>Mahomet Cunahle Marca.</HI> This <HI>Mahomet</HI> was Governour, or rather Prince of it at this time; and as he was nothing inferior to his Uncle in Courage or Conduct, so he had Fortified the place so as to make it absolutely one of the strongest Garrisons in the <HI>Indies,</HI> nei∣ther did he insult the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> only, but the <HI>Malabars</HI> also, and particularly the <HI>Samorim,</HI> in whose Country <HI>Cunahle</HI> stood, and who had given
<PB N="53" REF="38"/> leave to his Uncle to fortifie that place, on pur∣pose to incommode the <HI>Portugueze.</HI></P>
<P>And tho' the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Historians will have it, that he took this Affair of <HI>Cunahle</HI> only in the way to his Visitation; yet by the course of his pro∣cedure, one would be tempted to think, that it was what principally carried him to those Parts.</P>
<P>On the 27th. of <HI>December,</HI> 1598. the Arch-Bishop Embarked upon a Gally Commanded by <HI>Don Alvaro de Menezes,</HI> and on the day of <HI>Epi∣phany,</HI> arrived at the Bar of <HI>Cunahle,</HI> where he joined the whole <HI>Portugueze</HI> Armada, Comman∣ded by the Viceroy's Brother, he was saluted with all the Guns and Musick of the Fleet; and having called a Council of War, and heard the several Opinions of all the Captains con∣cerning the best way to take <HI>Cunahle,</HI> he dispatch∣ed the resolution they had come to thereon, to the Council of State at <HI>Goa;</HI> a most Apostolical begin∣ning of a Visitation. After having put the Siege of <HI>Cunahle</HI> into a good Posture, he departed with a good Convoy to <HI>Cananor,</HI> where he continued 16 days, and then sailed to <HI>Cochim,</HI> where he was splendidly received by the Governour and the whole City, at the Stairs they had made on purpose for him to Land at.</P>
<P>Next day, when the Magistrates of the City came to Complement him at his House, he ac∣quainted them with his design of reducing the Christians of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> before he returned to
<PB N="54" REF="39"/> <HI>Goa,</HI> desiring their assistance therein, which they frankly promised him.</P>
<P>The day following His <HI>Grace</HI> having called the common Council of the City together, re∣commended the enterprise of <HI>Cunahle</HI> to them, whom he made so sensible of how great impor∣tance it was to their City above all others, to have that Fortress wrested out of the hands of the <HI>Ma∣hometan</HI> Pyrates, who had lately made themselves Masters of it, that they immediately caused 150 Men to be Raised and Armed at their own Charge, whom, together with a great quantity of all sorts of Ammunition, they sent upon five stout Ships to joyn the <HI>Armada</HI> before <HI>Cunahle;</HI> the Arch-Bi∣shop also, to give the more life to the enterprise, sent one of the best of his own <HI>Manchua's</HI> or Yachts, mann'd with his own menial Servants, along with them.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Cochim</HI> was much troubled to hear of the Arch-Bishop's being so hot upon the re∣duction of <HI>Cunahle,</HI> being sensible that a Peace betwixt the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> and the <HI>Samorim,</HI> with∣out whose assistance by Land, it wou'd be hard for them to reduce that Fortress, must be the Con∣sequence of the enterprise. And as there had been nothing, the Kings of <HI>Cochim</HI> had been always more careful to hinder such a Peace, which they than did on purpose to keep the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> in a closer dependance upon them; so the present King fol∣lowing the wise measures of his Ancestors, en∣deavour'd, by a Stratagem, to destroy the Con∣fidence he saw the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> had already repo∣sed
<PB N="55" REF="39"/> in the <HI>Samorim.</HI> To which end he sent his <HI>Chief Justice,</HI> and one <HI>Joan de Miranda,</HI> a Gentleman of <HI>Cochim,</HI> to wait upon the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> and to acquaint his <HI>Grace</HI> from him, that he had received certain advice from some Spies he had in the <HI>Samorim</HI> Cabinet-Council, that that Prince, whenever the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> Landed, in∣stead of joyning with them, had determined to cut them all off in revenge of the many In∣juries they had done his Ancestors, of which danger he thought himself obliged, both as a Friend and a Brother in Arms to the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> to advise him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> who understood the In∣trigues of Princes, as well as any Man living, returned the King his Thanks for his Intelligence, but withal sent him word, that they were re∣solved to trust the <HI>Samorim</HI> in this occasion; and the rather, because they did not want Power to be revenged on all that should deceive the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> either in Peace or War.</P>
<P>The King, when he found his Plot had not succeeded according to his expectation, resolved to divert the <HI>Samorim</HI> from sending an Army to <HI>Cunahle,</HI> by making a War presently upon the <HI>Caimal,</HI> or Prince of <HI>Corngeira</HI> his Friend and Allie: and having with incredible expedition got an Army of 60000 Men together, he sent to let the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> know, that before he marched he designed to wait upon him. The <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> tho' he did not go over his Threshold to meet the King, received him, when he came,
<PB N="56" REF="40"/> with great Civility; and after the Complements were over, acquainted him first, with his In∣tention of visiting all the <HI>Christian Churches</HI> in the <HI>Serra,</HI> in order to reduce them to the true Christian Faith, from which they had very much swerved; telling him, that since great numbers of those Churches were within his Territories, he expected his assistance in so good a work; of which being assured by the King, the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> went on and told him, that there was another thing that he must not deny him, and that was to put off his War with the <HI>Caimal</HI> till <HI>Cunahle</HI> was taken; the King gave many reasons why he could not deferr it; but the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> prest him so hard upon the point, that before they parted, he made him promise to disband his Army.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> having put the Affairs of the Siege in a good posture, begun to apply himself to the reduction of the Christians of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> and the first step he made towards it, was to send to the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> to come and speak with him at <HI>Cochim.</HI> But after having expected him some days, and finding that he neither came himself, nor returned him any answer, he con∣cluded, as well he might, that he was afraid to venture himself in that City; whereupon he sent him a Letter of <HI>safe Conduct,</HI> swearing he would not question him about any thing that was past.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arch-Deacon,</HI> upon this occasion, Assem∣bled a great number of <HI>Caçanares,</HI> and other
<PB N="57" REF="40"/> considerable Christians to consult together what was best to be done. It was agreed on all hands, that the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> shou'd go and wait upon his <HI>Lordship,</HI> who was a Person of that Autho∣rity as to be able to undo them all at once, by depriving them of their <HI>Pepper</HI>-Trade, if they should disoblige him, and besides, he was able to oblige their Kings, who were all very much at his Devotion, to Sacrifice all their Lives and E∣states to his displeasure; and what made them the willinger to comply with him therein, was, their being confident that they should be quickly rid of his Company, since Winter was at hand, which they thought would certainly call him to <HI>Goa.</HI></P>
<P>Upon all which Considerations it was agreed, That they should give way to his saying of <HI>Mass,</HI> and his Preaching in their Churches, which their Books told them was a common Civility, that is every where paid to Bishops, tho' out of their own Diocesses; but as for any Acts of Jurisdicti∣on, such as Visiting, Conferring Orders, Excom∣municating, and the like, if he should pretend to exercise any such Acts, as it was to be feared he would, that they shou'd then put him off as well as they cou'd with delays, until he returned to <HI>Goa,</HI> which they thought he would in two Months at farthest; by which means they might, without embroiling themselves with so powerful a Prelate, wait till they had a Bishop sent them by the Patriarch of <HI>Babylon,</HI> to whom they had writ for one; of all which they made a pub∣lick
<PB N="58" REF="41"/> Instrument, and for their further Security, brought together a Body of 3000 brave Men, who were all well Armed; the Christians of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> being, by much, both the stoutest and best Firemen in the <HI>Indies,</HI> as the <HI>Portu∣guezes</HI> knew very well, which made them be the more zealous to reduce them to the <HI>Roman Church,</HI> in order to make them Subjects to the King of <HI>Portugal.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> sent also at the same time to some of their <HI>Paniquais,</HI> some of which have 4000, some 6000 Men at their Command, to come and speak with him at <HI>Cochim;</HI> but they, instead of going thither, took an Oath solemnly to make themselves <HI>Amouços,</HI> after the Custom of the <HI>Malavars,</HI> against him, in case he offer'd any violence to their <HI>Arch-Deacon,</HI> or to any other of their Priests. When the <HI>Malavars</HI> devote themselves to be <HI>Amouços</HI> for any cause, they defend it to the last drop of their Blood, with∣out either fear or wit.</P>
<P>With two of these <HI>Paniquais,</HI> and 3000 Men well Armed, the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> came to wait up∣on the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> at <HI>Cochim. Don Antonio de Noronha,</HI> the Governour of the City, met them without the Gates, and conducted them to the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI>'s Palace. The <HI>Arch-Deacon,</HI> when he came before the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> kneeled down and kiss'd his Hand, as did all the other <HI>Caçanares</HI> that were in his Company; the two <HI>Paniquais</HI> were also presented to his <HI>Lordship</HI> by the <HI>Arch-Deacon,</HI> who when the <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> and the <HI>Governour,</HI>
<PB N="59" REF="41"/> and the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> came to sit down, placed themselves at the Elbows of the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI>'s Chair, where they stood all the while with their broad Swords naked over his Head. The door of the Room where they were being shut, to keep out the Crowd, those that stood without imagining that it was done to make their <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> a Prisoner, said to one another, this is the time to die for our <HI>Arch-Deacon,</HI> and for the Church of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> but being assured that their <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> was in no danger, they were quieted.</P>
<P>After the hubbub was over, and they had dis∣coursed together for some time, it was agreed, that the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> should go next day to <HI>Vaipi∣cotta,</HI> which upon the account of its having a College of <HI>Jesuites</HI> in it, should be the first Church he should Visit, and that the <HI>Arch-Dea∣con</HI> with his <HI>Caçanares,</HI> should repair thither im∣mediately.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> having furnished himself with all Necessaries for his Voyage, embarked with all his Retinue upon seven <HI>Tones</HI> or <HI>Gallies,</HI> and <HI>Roque de Mello Pereyro,</HI> who had been Governour of <HI>Malaca,</HI> attended him with two <HI>Gallies</HI> more, and <HI>Joan Pereyra de Miranda,</HI> who was afterwards Governour of <HI>Cranganor</HI> with one.</P>
<P>Being arrived at <HI>Vaipicotta,</HI> he was conduct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by the <HI>Jesuites,</HI> and their Scholars, and the whole Village to the Church, where, with his <HI>Mitre</HI> on his Head, and his <HI>Crosier</HI> in his hand, he gave them a long Sermon. His Text was, <HI>He that
<PB N="60" REF="42"/> entereth not in by the door,</HI> &amp;c. on which words he told them at length, <HI>That none were true Pa∣stors, but what entered in by the door of the</HI> Roman <HI>Church, and were sent by the Pope, who was Christ's Vicar; which none of their former Prelates having been, who had been all sent to them by the Schisma∣tical Bishops of</HI> Babylon, <HI>they were all Thieves and Murderers of the Flock.</HI> When he had done his Sermon, he bid them come next day to the Church to be confirmed, which some did; to whom, after he had confirmed them, he told the news of <HI>Purgatory,</HI> a place most of them had never heard of before.</P>
<P>All this while no <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> appeared, who came not to <HI>Vaipicotta,</HI> till two days after the arrival of the <HI>Arch-Bishop.</HI> He had delayed his coming on purpose, that he might not by his pre∣sence, seem to consent to any of those things, which he knew the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> would offer to do at that place.</P>
<P>Tho' the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> knew well enough what it was that had made the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> loiter so behind, yet he dissembled so far as to receive him very kindly, treating with him about the course he was to take in the reduction of the Church, who seemed to approve of every thing that was proposed to him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> went daily to <HI>Matins</HI> and <HI>Vespers,</HI> which were sung by those of the Semi∣nary in <HI>Chaldee,</HI> but coming to understand at last, for he understood <HI>Chaldee</HI> no more than he did <HI>Malavar,</HI> that they prayed therein for the Patri∣arch
<PB N="61" REF="42"/> of <HI>Babylon,</HI> stiling him the <HI>Ʋniversal Pastor of the Church,</HI> a Title that all Patriarchs, as well as the Pope, have assumed to themselves for some Hundred of Years (nay, by what <HI>Gre∣gory</HI> I. has said of that Title, I do not know but the Pope might be one of the last that assumed it) he resolved not to permit so wicked a thing to be done any longer, notwithstanding all that the good <HI>Jesuites,</HI> who out of Policy had all along complyed with it, could say to disswade him; and so having one Evening, without com∣municating his design to any one, called all the <HI>Jesuites,</HI> Masters of the Seminary, and the <HI>Arch-Deacon,</HI> and his <HI>Caçanares,</HI> together at his Lodg∣ings, having first made a Speech to them to prove, <HI>That the</HI> Pope <HI>was the only Head of the Church on Earth, and that the Bishop of</HI> Babylon <HI>was a Here∣tick and Schismatick,</HI> he pulled out of his Pocket an Excommunication <HI>latae sententiae,</HI> commanding his Secretary to read it with an audible Voice, and his Interpreter to declare it to those that did not understand <HI>Latin,</HI> in <HI>Malavar,</HI> by which he Commanded, <HI>That no Person Secular or Ecclesi∣astick do from henceforward presume to pray for the</HI> Patriarch of Babylon. He Commanded the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> and <HI>Caçanares</HI> to sign it, and finding the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> had a great mind to have shuf∣fled it off, he said to him, <HI>Sign it, Father, for it is full time the Axe were laid to the Root of the Tree;</HI> to which the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> returned no an∣swer, but Signed it without saying a word, as did all the other <HI>Caçanares,</HI> after which
<PB N="62" REF="43"/> it was fixed to the Gates of the Church.</P>
<P>The Christians of the Village, when they came to hear of what had been done, run, as if they had been Mad, in a Body to the <HI>Arch-Dea∣con</HI>'s Lodgings, where, with one voice, they set up a most lamentable howl, crying out, <HI>That the Arch-Bishop of</HI> Goa, <HI>with his</HI> Portuguezes <HI>was come to destroy their Religion, and had affronted their</HI> Patriarch, <HI>by whom they had been Governed for above</HI> 1200 <HI>Years;</HI> and after having exclaimed against the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> at a most bitter rate, and bewailed their great Misery, in having Strangers come among them to destroy the Religion they had been born and bred in, they told their <HI>Cassa∣nares,</HI> that if they would but give way to it, they would either Sacrifice their Lives in defence of their Religion, or be revenged on those that had affronted it.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> having made a sign, that he desired to be heard, they all held their Peace, he told them, <HI>There was a time for all things, and that that was not a time for Revenge, but Dissimu∣lation; that it was true he had Signed the Excom∣munication, but that he did it purely out of Fear, for they were to consider, that, besides the Strength the</HI> Arch-Bishop <HI>had brought along with him, he had engaged the King of</HI> Cochim, <HI>in whose Country they were, to protect him in all he did, and who, if they should offer any affront to the</HI> Arch-Bishop, <HI>would certainly revenge it on their Lives and Estates. As to himself, he was resolved to die in defence of the Religion of his Country, sooner than consent to the
<PB N="63" REF="43"/> introduction of</HI> Popery; adding, <HI>The</HI> Portuguezes, <HI>if they liked their own Religion, might live in it, in God's Name, and he knew no Body that would trouble them for it; but that he saw no reason why they should thus disturb and persecute People in their own Country, because they will not turn</HI> Papists, <HI>or change their</HI> old Religion <HI>for theirs, and that as to the</HI> Arch-Bishop, <HI>the thing that made him so furious to destroy the Authority of the</HI> Patriarch of Babylon <HI>was, that he might make himself Primate of the</HI> In∣dies; <HI>to which he hoped, none of the Christians of</HI> Malabar <HI>would ever consent, or would ever be per∣swaded to forsake their</HI> old Religion <HI>for that of</HI> Popery. At this they all gave a great shout, crying, <HI>They would lose their Lives, and all they had in the World, before they would do it.</HI> But none of the forementioned <HI>Amoucos</HI> being among them, it's like, at that time they went no fur∣ther.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portuguezes</HI> upon this uproar, did not forbear to blame the <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> for having pub∣lished such an <HI>Excommunication,</HI> contrary to the advice of all that were about him, advising him to hasten aboard his Galleys if he would secure his Person; he told them, <HI>He was so far from re∣penting for what he had done, that were it to do again, he would do it, and that instead of retreating to</HI> Cochim, <HI>he would go next Morning to</HI> Paru.</P>
<P><HI>Paru</HI> is the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of a Kingdom, wherein the noblest Body of all the Christians of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> lives, but withal, the most violent against <HI>Popery,</HI> as they had sufficiently manifested on several oc∣casions;
<PB N="64" REF="44"/> for tho' <HI>Don Jorge du Cruz,</HI> and <HI>Don Joan du Cruz,</HI> both Natives of the Country, had been sent by the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> to <HI>Rome</HI> in the time of <HI>Gregory</HI> XIII. who had done them great Honours there, and had granted them ma∣ny <HI>Indulgences</HI> for their Churches, and withal, a Privileged Altar therein, yet their Countrymen did not only slight all those <HI>Indulgences,</HI> but would not so much as suffer them, tho' of two of the noblest Families in the Country, to offici∣ate in any of their Churches, and at last forc'd them to leave the Kingdom, their own Brethren and Kinsfolk, having the first hand in their ex∣pulsion.</P>
<P>The Christians of <HI>Paru,</HI> tho' thus affected to the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, had, according to the fore∣mentioned Agreement, prepared great <HI>Festivities</HI> for the reception of the <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> hoping, by such Complements, to have kept him from doing any business; but, having the Night before he came, heard of what he had done at <HI>Vaipi∣cotta</HI> to their Patriarch, they turned all their <HI>Festivities</HI> into <HI>Arms,</HI> and were so much incensed against him, that when he Landed, he was met by eight or ten Persons only that waited on the <HI>Arch-Deacon.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> tho' he read trouble and de∣jection in all their Countenances, seemed to take no notice of it, but with his <HI>Cross</HI> carried before him went directly to the Church, which, con∣trary to Custom, he found full of Armed Men, without so much as one Woman or Child a∣mongst
<PB N="65" REF="44"/> them; whereupon, being apprehensive lest his Guards and Servants, if they continued ashoar, might come to Blows with the <HI>Malavars,</HI> whom he saw so much disposed to Quarrel, he Commanded them all aboard except two Priests, who were to assist at the Offices.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> having put on his <HI>Pontificals,</HI> and given his Blessing to the Congregation, made a long discourse to them, shewing them, <HI>That there was but one true Religion, which was the</HI> Roman, <HI>and that all Christians were under an in∣dispensable obligation to submit themselves to the</HI> Pope. After he had done his Sermon, which lasted an hour and an half, and explained to them the Doctrine of the Sacrament of <HI>Confirma∣tion,</HI> and then called upon them to come to it; the Congregation, tho' they had heard him till then very quietly; began to cry out with great fury, <HI>That they would never be Confirmed by him, that being a thing that none of their Prelates had ever used, and that it was no Sacrament of Christ's Institution, but an Invention of the</HI> Portuguezes <HI>to make them their Slaves, by</HI> setting a Mark on their Foreheads, <HI>and</HI> giving them a Box on the Ear, which is what all the <HI>Roman</HI> Bishops do in <HI>Confir∣mation, and tho' the</HI> Dastards <HI>in</HI> Vaipicotta <HI>had been so tame as to suffer themselves to be buffeted and en∣slaved by him, they would never endure it, nor suf∣fer him to touch their Beards, or their Wives Faces; that he might go home in a good hour to his</HI> Portu∣guezes, <HI>and let them alone with their Religion, and if he did continue to disturb them thus, it should
<PB N="66" REF="45"/> cost him dear.</HI> The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> heard all this with great patience, and sitting down, endea∣voured to convince them of the Truth of the Sacrament of <HI>Confirmation;</HI> but when he per∣ceived that they were the worse, rather than the better for what he said to them, having mu∣stered all his Courage together, he rose up, and having advanced two steps with his <HI>Crosier</HI> in his hand, he told them with great heat, <HI>That the Faith he Preached to them was the Faith of</HI> Christ <HI>and St.</HI> Thomas, <HI>and was believed by all Christians, and that he was ready to die to confirm the truth of it;</HI> but they being as ready to die for their Reli∣gion as he was, or pretended to be, for his, that Argument had no effect at all upon them. He furthermore challenged all those that <HI>Talked a∣gainst the</HI> Roman <HI>Faith by Night in Corners, to come forth, if they durst, to dispute with him pub∣lickly;</HI> which the <HI>Arch-Deacon,</HI> who the Night before had assembled most of the considerable Christians of <HI>Paru</HI> together, and had made them promise never to throw off the <HI>Patriarch</HI> of <HI>Ba∣bylon,</HI> taking to himself, he rose up in, a passion, and having asked aloud <HI>who they were that taught Heresies in the dark, and that Preached no where but in Corners,</HI> flung out of the <HI>Church,</HI> and going into the Town picked up eight or ten Boys, whom he presented to the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> to be confirmed by him, pretending, that with all that he was able to do, he could perswade no more to come: The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> having confirmed these Boys, returned to his Gallies very angry,
<PB N="67" REF="45"/> and finding there was nothing more to be done at <HI>Paru,</HI> he determined to Sail next Morning to <HI>Mangate,</HI> to see how those <HI>Christians</HI> stood af∣fected.</P>
<P>When he came to the Church of <HI>Mangate,</HI> a Town chiefly inhabited by Christians, he found the Church filled with Houshold Goods and Wo∣men, by reason of the War that was then on foot between the Kings of <HI>Mangate</HI> and <HI>Paru.</HI> After having comforted the Christians for the Losses they had sustained, and given them his Blessing, he began to Preach against the Errors they had been Educated in. But having advice that there were some <HI>Amouços</HI> coming after him from <HI>Paru,</HI> he went straightways aboard his Gallies, and row∣ing away before Night, he arrived next Morn∣ing at <HI>Cheguree,</HI> a place belonging to his Friend the King of <HI>Cochim;</HI> where having sent ashore an Order to the <HI>Caçanares</HI> and <HI>Christians</HI> to meet him at the Church, he had word sent him, that the Church doors were all shut, and there was nei∣ther Man, Woman, nor Child, to be seen in the whole Village; he was informed at Night, that the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> was in the Town, but that he had shut himself up in a House, and was resolved never to see his <HI>Lordship</HI> again.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portuguezes</HI> that were in his Train, as well Ecclesiasticks as Seculars, were at him perpetually to give over this enterprise, and not to expose his Person and Dignity (as he did) to no purpose; but instead of returning any answer to their
<PB N="68" REF="46"/> Importunities, he retired all alone to his <HI>Cabin,</HI> where he wrote a long Letter to the <HI>Arch-Deacon,</HI> in which he swore that he remembred nothing that was past, and that he had no design of doing him any harm, and if he would but do him the favour to come and speak with him once more, he did not doubt but that he should be able to convince him of his Errors, promising with all to do great things for him, if he would but entirely submit himself to the <HI>Roman</HI> Church.</P>
<P>This Letter was delivered the same Night to the <HI>Arch-Deacon,</HI> who having read it, called the <HI>Caçanares</HI> together, and told them, that it being a scandalous thing in them to decline treating with the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> above board, about the Affairs of Religion, he was for their going to wait upon him to hear what he could say, but with such a Guard, that it should not be in his Power to make them Prisoners. Having all agreed to this Proposition, they sent to the <HI>Arch Bishop</HI> to let him know, That if he would be please<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to come ashoar, they would wait, upon him The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> sent them back word, That th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sun was too hot to stand in, and desired the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> therefore to come aboard his Galley, which la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with her <HI>Stern</HI> on ground. The <HI>Arch-Deaco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and <HI>Caçanares</HI> seeing the Galley quite surrounde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by their People ventured to go aboard; whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being come, they were conducted to the <HI>Arc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>Bishop</HI>'s Cabin, where they found him with a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Priests, <HI>Jesuites,</HI> and several Gentlemen e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦pecting them. After some discourse, the <HI>Arc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>Deaco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
<PB N="69" REF="46"/> told the <HI>Arch-Bishop, That it was true they had not received his</HI> Grace <HI>so courteously as might have been expected, nor indeed as they inten∣ded to have done, had he not fallen so foul upon their</HI> Patriarch, <HI>whom, tho' he had been pleased to call an Excommunicate Heretick, they knew to be both a Catholick and a most holy Man, and endea∣voured to introduce several Novelties into the</HI> Serra, <HI>which they and their Forefathers had never so much as heard of before.</HI> To all which the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> answered, <HI>That he was sure they were not ignorant of the Patriarch of</HI> Babylon<HI>'s being a Professed</HI> Ne∣storian, <HI>and not to trouble them with any Arguments to prove that all</HI> Nestorians <HI>must be Hereticks, he would only ask them one single Question,</HI> which was, <HI>Whether they believed the Gospel of St.</HI> John? They told him <HI>they did, and would die rather than deny any thing that was revealed in it. Well then,</HI> said the <HI>Arch-Bishop, pray tell me, how you can re∣concile what St.</HI> John <HI>saith,</HI> The word was made Flesh, and dwelt among us, <HI>with what your Pa∣triarchs and Bishops have taught you, to wit,</HI> that the Word did not make it self Flesh, and that Christ was not God, and that God did not make himself Man, <HI>for do you not sing in your Churches upon the Feast of the Nativity, that the Word did not make it self Flesh, as the unbelieving</HI> Romans <HI>teach, but did only dwell in Christ as in a Temple.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> returned no answer to this, but passing to another point, said to the <HI>Arch-Bishop, Your</HI> Grace <HI>would fain perswade us likewise, that none can be saved out of the Obedience of the</HI>
<PB N="70" REF="47"/> Roman <HI>Church, which is what St.</HI> John <HI>no where saith, that ever I could see; besides, we have in our</HI> Archives <HI>a Letter of St.</HI> Caius, <HI>Bishop of</HI> Rome, <HI>wherein he confesseth that he had nothing to do with the Church of</HI> Babylon, <HI>no more than the Church of</HI> Babylon <HI>had to do with his Church. We have also another Letter, which is called in our Books the</HI> Letter of the Lord's-day, <HI>because it is said upon that day to have fallen down from Heaven, where∣in the same Truth is affirmed.</HI> Here the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> run into a long discourse of the Primacy of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and of the <HI>Pope</HI>'s being his Successor, and <HI>Christ's Vicar</HI> upon Earth; after which they came at last to this Agreement, That as to matters of Faith, a Synod should be called to determine them; and that in the mean while the <HI>Arch-Bi∣shop</HI> might, if he pleased, give the Blessing, and Preach in any of their Churches, but should not be received in them as their Prelate, but as a Bishop that was a Stranger, neither should he pretend to <HI>Confirm,</HI> or do any other Episcopal Act within that Diocess. This Agreement was Signed by the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> and the <HI>Arch-Deacon,</HI> and all the <HI>Caçanares</HI> who were present, with a Declaration that the Synod should be Celebrated before <HI>Whitsuntide,</HI> and that the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> should no longer stir up the People against him, nor go attended with such Troops of Armed Men as he had done formerly.</P>
<P>This Agreement being Signed, the <HI>Arch-Bi∣shop</HI> set Sail for <HI>Canhur,</HI> whither the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> went by Land, not daring to trust himself by
<PB N="71" REF="47"/> Water, where he would have been in the Power of the <HI>Portuguezes.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Canhur</HI> he was received very friendly by the <HI>Christians,</HI> who had been told by the <HI>Arch-Deacon,</HI> that he did not pretend to come among them as their Prelate, but only as a Stranger, but tho' he kept to his Agreement so far as not to of∣fer to do any thing but give the Blessing and Preach, yet in his <HI>Sermon,</HI> which was a very long one, he talked so much of the <HI>Roman Church,</HI> and its <HI>Supremacy,</HI> and of the obligation all Churches were under to submit to it, that the whole Congregation were much offended with him; the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> was likewise discontented with it, and being Sick, or at least pretending he was, returned to <HI>Cheguree</HI> to be cured; and the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> having other work on his hands, was willing enough to dismiss him; who, in pursu∣ance of the Instruction he brought with him from <HI>Goa,</HI> was obliged to hasten to <HI>Coulaon,</HI> a Fortress belonging to the <HI>Portuguezes,</HI> to see in what condition it was, and to take some course to have the Fort the King of <HI>Travancor</HI> was build∣ing in its Neighbourhood, and would much in∣commode it, demolished.</P>
<P>On the first of <HI>March</HI> he set Sail for a Castle that is within two Leagues of <HI>Cochim,</HI> where the Governour and Bishop of the City met him, to whom having communicated his Designs, he Sailed directly for <HI>Porcoa,</HI> where the King of the Country had been some days expecting him; he went to a Church that was there in the Evening,
<PB N="72" REF="48"/> where he was kindly received by the <HI>Christians;</HI> the King, who professed a great Friendship for the <HI>Portuguezes,</HI> having Commanded them, upon pain of his displeasure, to comply with the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> in all things. After having Preached, he went to Lodge at the House of the <HI>Caçanar,</HI> whi∣ther the King came at Night to visit him; the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> entertained him very friendly, and thanked him for the kindness he had shewed to the <HI>Christians</HI> of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> and their Churches, and for having cleared his Coast of Pyrates: the King, after some Complements desired to be admitted to the Honour of being a <HI>Brother in Arms</HI> to the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> as the King of <HI>Cochim</HI> had been: The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> told him, that was an Honour the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> never did to any King, before he had merited it by some signal Service; however, he promised to do all that lay in his Power to help him to it.</P>
<P>Next Morning the <HI>Arch-Bishap</HI> went to Church, where he said <HI>Mass,</HI> and afterwards confirmed the whole Congregation, notwithstanding his late solemn Promise to the contrary, as indeed none but Fools will ever expect, that <HI>Papists</HI> will ob∣serve any such Promises longer than the first op∣portunity they have to break them.</P>
<P>From <HI>Porcoa</HI> he sailed directly to <HI>Coulaon,</HI> where, under pretence of visiting a Church that stood near the Fort the King of <HI>Travancor</HI> was building, he took a view of the Fort, and finding it was near finished, and would in a few days have a Garrison put in it, he immediately dis∣patched
<PB N="73" REF="48"/> away a Messenger to the Captain Gene∣ral of the Fleet and Troops that were before <HI>Cu∣nahle,</HI> to come forthwith with his whole <HI>Armada</HI> to demolish the said Fort, which, if he came quick∣ly, he might do with great ease, for that he would find none in it but Workmen.</P>
<P>Now you must know that the <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> when he was last at the Bar of <HI>Cunahle,</HI> notwith∣standing that the King of <HI>Travancor</HI> and the <HI>Por∣tuguezes</HI> were at that time in Peace, had left a private Order with the General, that so soon as he was Master of <HI>Cunahle,</HI> he should set Sail im∣mediately with the whole <HI>Armada,</HI> and demolish this Fort, which, by reason of <HI>Cunahle</HI>'s not being yet taken, had not been executed.</P>
<P>But while the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> was expecting the Captain-General, he received the bad news of a great slaughter of <HI>Portuguezes</HI> in an Attack they had made upon <HI>Cunahle,</HI> and that the Captain-General was retired to <HI>Cochim</HI> to have his wound∣ed Men cured; from whence he intended to come and wait upon him for further Orders.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> was extreamly troubled at this News, as well upon the account of the great numbers of Persons of Quality that had been killed in the Action, as because he feared it would very much hearten the Kings of <HI>Malabar,</HI> who had till then still looked upon the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> as Invincible. Wherefore, to prevent the ill effects that the true News of this Defeat might have up∣on the Minds of the Princes of <HI>Malabar,</HI> he dis∣patched Letters immediately to all of them to
<PB N="74" REF="49"/> acquaint them with the great Victory the <HI>Portu∣guezes</HI> had obtained before <HI>Cunahle;</HI> and tho' he acknowledged, that it was purchased with the Blood of several brave Men, among whom were some of his own Kindred, who were very dear to him, yet he did not doubt but that they would infallibly carry the Place, at the next Attack they made.</P>
<P>These tricks of the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> coming so thick, one upon the neck of another, for here we have no fewer than three of them in less than a Fortnight, puts me in mind of what <HI>Manuel de Faria</HI> saith of him in the <HI>3d.</HI> Tome of his <HI>Asia Portuguesa,</HI> which I shall give the Reader in his own words, <Q REND="margDblQuotes">Este illustre Prelado estuviera yo por ventura en el numero de los santos, si no passara a Espanna a donde le quito esta gloria, en la opinion mortal, la deficil del acierto en el maneio de los grandes puestos que vinoa ocupar, o fuessen solicitudos, o fuessen ofrecidos.</Q> <Q REND="italic">This Illustrious Prelate, had he never returned to <HI>Spain,</HI> had, in all probability, been made a Saint before this time, where, thro' the difficulty there is in the managery of high Posts, whether offered to him or procured by Sollicitations, he lost all the Glory he had acquired in the <HI>Indies</HI> in the Opinion of the World.</Q></P>
<P>His High Posts in <HI>Spain,</HI> which the Author saith he does not know whether he procured by Sol∣licitations or not, were the <HI>Primacy of Braga,</HI> and <HI>Viceroyship of Portugal,</HI> under <HI>Philip</HI> III. for two Years, and the <HI>Presidentship</HI> of the <HI>Council of
<PB N="75" REF="49"/> State</HI> of <HI>Portugal</HI> at <HI>Madrid,</HI> in which Office and Court he died.</P>
<P>What his Miscarriages were in <HI>Spain,</HI> whereby he is said to have forfeited his Glory, I have not been able to learn; but whatever they were, one would think that the violating of a solemn Agree∣ment openly, within a Week after it was made, and the ordering a Fort belonging to a Prince, that was in Peace with them, to be treacherously demolished, and the dispersing of notorious Falshoods only to serve a turn, ought to be no very good title to <HI>Saintship.</HI> But the <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> if he could have had hands to have executed it, had served the King of <HI>Travancor</HI> a much worse trick than this, when he was upon his Visitation that was after the Synod. We are told of a live∣ly thing spoke by a <HI>Portugueze</HI> Captain, that was very brave, but had scarce Bread to eat, who, in this Siege, having seven of his Teeth struck out with a Musquet-Bullet, after he had wiped his Mouth said, <HI>The</HI> Mahometan <HI>had done him no Injury, and had known doubtless he had no need of Teeth.</HI> But to return to the Story.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> after having sent this false News about, and having sent to the Queen of <HI>Changanate,</HI> to let her know, that he should not be able to meet her according to his Promise, until he returned; Sailed in great hast to <HI>Cochim,</HI> to conferr with the Captain-General, and to consult whether it would not be convenient to make an absolute Peace with the <HI>Samorim,</HI> and the rather because he had been so true to his
<PB N="76" REF="50"/> Word, in carrying on the Siege of <HI>Cunahle.</HI> It was agreed on all hands that such a Peace would be convenient at that time; however, they would not venture to conclude it before they had the <HI>Viceroy</HI>'s Opinion of it, to whom they sent the Project.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> after he had dispatched this business, Sailed to <HI>Molandurte,</HI> a great place of Christians, where he was received very kindly, which kindness of theirs is said to have cost them dear; for the King of <HI>Cochim,</HI> to whom <HI>Molandurte</HI> belongs, being grown extreamly jealous that the <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> under a pretence of reducing the Christians of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> to the obe∣dience of the <HI>Roman Church,</HI> designed to bring them under the obedience of the Crown of <HI>Por∣tugal,</HI> as it is plain he did from the 24th <HI>Decree</HI> of the last <HI>Action</HI> of the following <HI>Synod,</HI> for this very reason laid a great Tribute upon them, which they have not been able to this day to shake off; and furthermore Commanded them, upon pain of Death, to repair to <HI>Angamale</HI> to their <HI>Arch-Deacon,</HI> who being there, and having heard, it's like, of the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI>'s having vio∣lated their Agreement within less than a Week after it was made, begun to thunder out Excom∣munications against him, writing to all his Churches to have nothing more to do with him, and to all the Princes of <HI>Malabar,</HI> to have a care of him as a Person that had ill designs upon their Subjects.</P>
<PB N="77" REF="50"/>
<P>While the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> was at <HI>Molandurte,</HI> where he confirmed and exercised all Episcopal Acts, he received Letters from the <HI>Viceroy</HI> ap∣proving his Project of Peace with the <HI>Samorim,</HI> and desiring him to return to <HI>Vaipim</HI> to Sign it, which he did in great haste, as did the Gover∣nour and Bishop of <HI>Cochim</HI> also, who both met him there.</P>
<P>This Peace was much promoted on the <HI>Samo∣rim</HI> side by his Nephew and first Minister <HI>Ʋniare Cherare,</HI> who, notwithstanding he had been pri∣vately Christned by Father <HI>Roz,</HI> had leave to con∣tinue to Profess himself a Heathen still, the better to enable him to serve the <HI>Portuguezes,</HI> which he did effectually, both by communicating to them daily all the Secrets of his Uncles Cabinet-Coun∣cil, whereof he was President, and by disposing him to have a good opinion of the <HI>Portuguezes;</HI> which was what he would not have been in a ca∣pacity to have done, but would have been imme∣diately disgraced, and turned out of all, had he discovered himself to have been a Christian so soon as he was Baptized. And as for the <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> we find he was so far from condemn∣ing either the Prince or the Jesuite for this scan∣dalous dissimulation, that after the Celebration of the Synod he confirmed and anointed the Prince therein, by giving him the Sacrament of <HI>Chrism</HI> or <HI>Confirmation,</HI> with the same Secresie, and the same Dispensation as the Jesuite had given him that of Baptism.</P>
<PB N="78" REF="51"/>
<P>After he had dispatched the Peace, Signed to the Captain-General, he set Sail for <HI>Diamper,</HI> the ancient Seat of several of the Bishops of the <HI>Serra,</HI> where meeting with several that had a mind to take Orders, there having been no Ordination in the Bishoprick for two Years, he gave notice that he intended to conferr Or∣ders on the <HI>Saturday</HI> before the <HI>Fifth Sunday</HI> in <HI>Lent.</HI></P>
<P>He writ also to the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> to come and assist at the Solemnity; the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> was much concerned at the news, and writ him back word, <HI>That this was contrary to the late A∣greement they had made together, and that his do∣ing of it would put an end to the Affair of the Synod, which he seemed to desire so much, since the prin∣cipal point that was to be debated therein was, <HI>Whether he was their Prelate or no?</HI></HI> But the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> fansying that the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> talked of a Synod only to amuse him and gain time, writ him word, that nothing should hinder him from Conferring Orders at the time appointed; and not only so, but that he would exercise all other Acts of Episcopal Jurisdiction, in obedience to the Pope's <HI>Briefs,</HI> to whom all the Churches of the World were subject. The <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> finding he was absolutely determined to Ordain, desired him, since he was resolved to do't right or wrong, to Ordain none but <HI>Latins,</HI> for so they called not only the <HI>Portuguezes,</HI> but all the <HI>Malavars,</HI> who were bred up under the <HI>Jesuites.</HI> The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> sent him word again, that he
<PB N="79" REF="51"/> would Ordain both <HI>Latins</HI> and <HI>Chaldaeans,</HI> it be∣ing his business to destroy that distinction by bringing all Christians under one head. Upon this the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> finding nothing else would do, ordered an Edict to be published in all the Churches of the Diocess, prohibiting all Christi∣ans, upon pain of Excommunication, <HI>latae senten∣tiae,</HI> to receive any Orders from him, with which he sent another Instrument, commanding all Priests and Christian People not to suffer him to come into any of their Churches, as also not to be present at any of his <HI>Masses</HI> or <HI>Sermons.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> had Preached two days fol∣lowing, and had confirmed a great many before these Instruments had reached <HI>Diamper;</HI> but after they came once to be published, they put a full stop to what went on so currently before: The oldest <HI>Caçanar</HI> of the Church requiring the <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> upon the receipt of them, to leave the place, and not to offer to set his Foot in their Church any more, nor to Confirm any Body, which among them, who anointed Children on the Head when they were Baptized, was an un∣necessary Ceremony.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this, the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> continued still a Preaching, and when the day appointed for the Ordination was come, Ordained 37 on it, having first obliged them to subscribe the Faith of <HI>Pius</HI> IV. and to swear obedience to the Pope. After this Solemnity was over, the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> determined to pass the <HI>Holy Week,</HI> and <HI>Easter</HI> at <HI>Carturte,</HI> a considerable Town of
<PB N="80" REF="52"/> <HI>Christians</HI> in the Dominions of the Queen of <HI>Pimenta.</HI> He took several Churches in his way thither, at some of which he met with a kind Reception, at others the Christians would not so much as see him. Being arrived at <HI>Carturte,</HI> after a dangerous Voyage, on the <HI>Friday</HI> before <HI>Palm-Sunday,</HI> he went to Church betimes next Morning, where having said <HI>Mass,</HI> and Preached, he Commanded the Congregation not to fail to be at Church next day, for that he had some∣thing of Importance to communicate to them; and having the same Night invited several of the most considerable Christians of the place aboard his Galley, by some means or other; for you must understand he was not sparing of his Money in this occasion, no more than he was of his Promises, he gained two of the most substantial among them intirely to his Party, who did him afterwards very great Service: Their Names were <HI>Itimato Mapula,</HI> and <HI>Itimane Mapula.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> not knowing but that the <HI>Por∣tuguezes</HI> Musick might charm the common People, and reconcile them to the <HI>Latin</HI> Service, to which they seemed to have a great aversion, sent for a full Quire from <HI>Cochim,</HI> and on <HI>Palm-Sunday</HI> had high <HI>Mass</HI> performed with the same Ceremony and Majesty that he could have had it done at <HI>Goa:</HI> but the <HI>Caçanares</HI> and People were so far from being satisfied with the Musick and pompous Ceremony of that Service, that if they liked it ill before, they liked it a great deal worse after that, as in truth none but they that
<PB N="81" REF="52"/> place all Religion in external Performances can do otherwise, there being no Passion which that Service will not excite in its Spectators (which is all the People are) sooner than Devotion.</P>
<P>The Queen of <HI>Pimenta</HI> being importun'd to it by several Christians, and her own Jealousies, sent an Order to the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> to leave her Kingdom in three days upon pain of Death, and not to trouble her Subjects with his <HI>Novelties,</HI> un∣der which, she had reason to apprehend some ill design against her State was couched. But the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> knew his own strength too well to be frighted away with Paper Threats, and so sent the Queen back word positively, that he would not stir out of her Territories before he had finished the work that had brought him thither, telling her withal, <HI>That he was serving her rather than otherwise in what he was doing, and that her</HI> Ancestors <HI>had granted Privileges to the Arch-Bishop of the</HI> Serra, <HI>but being</HI> Infidels <HI>had never offered to concern themselves in the matters of their Religion; That if she should Murther him, she must know, that she Muthered the second Man in the</HI> Indies; <HI>and that his would be the dearest Blood that ever she spilt in her Life; since the</HI> Portuguezes, <HI>the Greatness of whose Power she and her Kingdom could not be but sensible of, having so often felt it, would infal∣libly Revenge his Death to the utmost.</HI></P>
<P>What made the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> the stouter in this occasion, was his knowing that he had secured most of her <HI>Regedores,</HI> namely him of <HI>Carturte,</HI> and the Country about it to his Party, whom
<PB N="82" REF="53"/> he had engaged by very rich Presents to favour and protect him in the execution of his designs. The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> having thus intimidated the Queen, and bribed her Officers, began to make bolder steps than he had offered to make before, and so seeing a <HI>Caçanar</HI> at Church one day, whom he had excommunicated but a little before, for having presumed to excommunicate him, he sent to him to get him out of the Church, which was no place for an excommunicate Rebel as he was. The <HI>Caçanar</HI> laughed at the Order, and told him very briskly, <HI>That he would not go out of the Church, for that he was none of his Prelate, neither did he value</HI> Roman <HI>Excommunications no more than he did the dirt under his feet; the</HI> Roman <HI>Church having nothing to do with the Church of the</HI> Serra; the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> not being able to bear such a publick Affront, and knowing his Party in the Church to be the stronger, commanded the Ser∣vice and Musick to cease; and turning towards the place where the <HI>Caçanar</HI> stood, commanded him to come up to him, which the <HI>Caçanar</HI> re∣fusing to do with great scorn; he was dragg'd up to him by some <HI>Caçanares,</HI> and others that he had gained to his Party, and being kept down upon his Knees before him, was commanded to beg his <HI>Lordship</HI>'s Pardon; he told them resolutely, <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would die before he would do it, or any thing where¦by he should acknowledge him his Prelate.</HI> Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> perceiving that he was not to be ter¦rified into a compliance, ordered him to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> turned out of the Church; the <HI>Caçanar</HI> to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="83" REF="53"/> him, <HI>He would not be turned out of a Church where he had more to do than he had;</HI> upon this the whole Church was all in an uproar, some striving to keep him in the Church, and others to thrust him out, but the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI>'s Party being the stronger, after a great disturbance, turned out he was.</P>
<P>The Night following several <HI>Caçanares</HI> and others, abjured the Patriarch of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and were reconciled to the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> at the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI>'s Lodgings, which were over the Church. After which the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> was re∣solved either to make the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> bend, or to break with him totally; and so having all his Converts together, without whose advise he told them he would never do any thing; he de∣clared to them that he could no longer bear with the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI>'s Rebellion, and was therefore determined to depose him, and put another in his place, naming one <HI>Thomas Curia</HI> a near Kins∣man of the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI>'s, to be his Successor. They all owned that His <HI>Grace</HI> had great reason to be angry with the <HI>Arch-Deacon;</HI> but yet see∣ing he was but a young Man, and had had the ill luck to be in the hands of bad Counsellors, they intreated His <HI>Grace,</HI> before he declared his place void, to allow them some time to admonish him in, and to try whether they could not per∣swade him to Conformity; for which they desi∣red but twenty days, promising, that if he did not submit within the time, that they would never own him more, but would submit to any
<PB N="84" REF="54"/> <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> that His <HI>Grace</HI> should set over them. Next day they sent six to treat with him, who, tho' they took a great deal of pains to perswade him to submit himself to the <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> could not prevail with him to do it.</P>
<P>On <HI>Easter-Eve</HI> the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> had a second Ordination, whereat he Ordained a great many that had been hindred by the <HI>Regedores</HI> from coming to the first. The same day <HI>Francisco Roz,</HI> the <HI>Jesuite,</HI> who was afterwards made Bi∣shop of the <HI>Serra</HI> by the Pope, came to wait upon the <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> who, after <HI>Mass,</HI> told him, <HI>That he could not believe he was in</HI> Carturte, <HI>where, not many Months ago, having a mind to say</HI> Mass, <HI>he was forced to have the Church doors opened to him by the Queen's</HI> Regedor, <HI>and where, when he eleva∣ted the Sacrament, the People all shut their Eyes, that they might not see it; and beat one of his Scho∣lars for having named the</HI> Pope <HI>in his Prayer's; and when he shewed them an Image of our</HI> Lady, <HI>cried out, <HI>Away with that filthiness, we are Christians, and for that reason do not adore Idols or Pa∣gods.</HI></HI></P>
<P>On <HI>Easter-day</HI> the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> intended to have a most solemn <HI>Procession,</HI> which the <HI>Heathens</HI> having notice of, were resolved either to hinder or disturb it; but finding they were not strong enough to do the former, by reason of the <HI>Re∣gedore</HI>'s guarding the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> as he did, they hired the most infamous Sorcerer of the whole Country to kill the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> in the <HI>Procession,</HI> which he undertook to do with a Charm that
<PB N="85" REF="54"/> had never failed him, but as he begun to do his <HI>Tricks</HI> in the <HI>Procession,</HI> he was seized on and sent to Prison, and a Currier was immediately dispatched away to the Queen to acquaint her with what had been done: The Queen straight∣ways sent back an Order, that he should be put on the <HI>Caloete,</HI> which is a sharp Stake fastned in the Ground, which being stuck thorow the Body of the Malefactor, he dies thereon in great tor∣ment. But the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> would not give way to his being punished so, but condemned him to greater punishment, in sending him to <HI>Cochim</HI> to Row in the Gallies as long as he lived, which shews how great the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI>'s Power, how∣ever he came by it, was at <HI>Carturte,</HI> where he made his first great Conversion.</P>
<P>When the Morning-Service was over, the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> was invited by the <HI>Caçanares</HI> to the <HI>Nercha,</HI> which is a Feast kept in the Church on certain days, all the Christians that are present sitting down to it. The Bishop, if present, craves the Blessing, and in his absence, the eldest Priest of the Church. The Bishop has one half of the Provision, the Priests a quarter, and the People a quarter among them. In many Churches there are certain Rents dedicated to the maintenance of those Feasts, which seem to be the same with the Apostolical <HI>Agapae</HI> or <HI>Love-Feasts,</HI> I do not know but St. <HI>Paul</HI> might allude to this double Portion that the Bishop has at these Feasts, when he saith, <HI>That they who rule well, and labour in the Word and Doctrine, are
<PB N="86" REF="55"/> worthy of double Honour;</HI> and the rather because he immediately subjoyns, <HI>Thou shalt not muzzle the Ox that treadeth out the Corn,</HI> &amp;c. Besides it is evident from St. <HI>Cyprian,</HI> 34 <HI>Ep.</HI> to his Church of <HI>Carthage,</HI> that the Clergy were said to be Honoured, according to the proportion they had of the Publick Offerings where speak∣ing of <HI>Aurelius</HI> and <HI>Cellerinus,</HI> two Confessors, he writes, <HI>Presbyterii honorem designasse nos illis jam sciatis, &amp; sportulis iisdem cum Presbyteris honorentur, &amp; divisiones mensurnas aequatis quanti∣tatibus partiuntur.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> being tired with the Service of the day, desired to be excused assisting at the <HI>Nercha;</HI> nevertheless he had his double Portion sent home. It was a great branch of <HI>Figs,</HI> and several Cakes made of <HI>Rice</HI> and <HI>Honey,</HI> with several other Dishes dressed <HI>a la Mode de Malabar.</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> went and vi∣sited all the Sick in the Town, and gave them both Money and Ghostly Counsel, the People imagining that this was the common Practice of all the <HI>Roman</HI> Prelates, began to cry them up to the Skies, as much more humble and charita∣ble than the <HI>Chaldean</HI> Bishop.</P>
<P>On <HI>Easter-Tuesday</HI> the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> went out to <HI>Nagpili,</HI> a Church about a quarter of a League from <HI>Carturte,</HI> where having Preached, he confir∣med a great many, and reconciled several <HI>Caça∣nares</HI> to the <HI>Roman</HI> Church. By the way, it is something strange too, how the <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> tho' he was able to School their Kings and <HI>Regedores,</HI>
<PB N="87" REF="55"/> who all spoke <HI>Portugueze,</HI> should be so powerful a Preacher as the <HI>Portugueze</HI> make him to have been among the <HI>Malavars,</HI> considering that he nei∣ther knew a word of their Language, nor they of his.</P>
<P>Next day the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> set Sail for <HI>Molan∣durte,</HI> where, when he arrived, he found the People much changed from what they were, when he was there last, for they had shut the Church doors against him, neither did there so much as one single Person appear to receive him at the place where he was to Land, which was a quarter of a League from the Town.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> understanding how things were ashoar, did not offer to Land for fear of raising a Tumult, but wrote away immediately to the Governour of <HI>Cochim,</HI> to send the King of <HI>Cochim</HI>'s chief <HI>Regedor</HI> to him before <HI>Mo∣landurte.</HI> The King, tho' he did not love to hear of the Christians of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> submitting them∣selves to the <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> being very sensible, if they were once brought under <HI>Portugueze</HI> Bishops, it would not be long before they would be entirely under the Crown of <HI>Portugal</HI> too, by which means he should lose 50000 of the best Soldiers in his Kingdom; yet at the same time he appear∣ed very zealous to promote that work, having more than once Commanded all his Christian Subjects in all things to do what the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> would have them, and accordingly when the Go∣vernour sent him word that the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> desi∣red to speak with the chief <HI>Regedor</HI> at <HI>Molandurte,</HI> he immediately ordered him to go and wait on him.</P>
<PB N="88" REF="56"/>
<P>When the <HI>Regedor</HI> was come, the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> complained to him of the vexation his Master had given the Christians of <HI>Molandurte,</HI> for no other reason but for the kind reception they had given him when he was there last. The <HI>Regedor</HI> endeavoured to palliate the matter, and promised to acquaint his Master with what the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> had told him, <HI>Who, if any thing were amiss,</HI> he said, <HI>would be sure to redress it, and to give his</HI> Grace <HI>satisfaction.</HI> The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> here took him up short, and told him, <HI>That he ex∣pected no kindness from his Master, since he had de∣nied him so small a favour, as to order the Mus∣quets that were lodged in the Quire of the Church, to be removed to a proper place, which, tho' he had faithfully promised to do, yet he understood the Mus∣quets were there still.</HI> The <HI>Regedor</HI> told him, <HI>The</HI> Regedor <HI>of the Place, and not his Master, was to blame for that, who, to his knowledge, was ordered to have done it.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> and <HI>Regedor</HI> went to Church together, where the <HI>Regedor,</HI> in his hear∣ing, commanded all the Christians of the place, in the King's Name, to do whatsoever the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> should command them. But, tho' he is said, at the same time to have whispered some in the Ear, That the King would rather that they should adhere to their <HI>Arch-Deacon,</HI> and their old Customs, than submit to the <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> yet that did not appear in the sudden change that was wrought in their Carriage, by what the <HI>Regedor</HI> had told them publickly; for they
<PB N="89" REF="56"/> who but the day before would not so much as endure to see the <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> were, without any other Argument, reconciled to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and him the next day.</P>
<P>From <HI>Molandurte</HI> the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> went a se∣cond time to <HI>Diamper,</HI> where the chief <HI>Regedor,</HI> according to his promise, met him again. The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> complained to him of the <HI>Regedor</HI> of the place, who had not only hindred the <HI>Christians</HI> from coming at him, but encouraged several <HI>Heathens</HI> to deride and threaten him; as the chief <HI>Regedor</HI> was offering to excuse his Bro∣ther, the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> interrupted him, and strik∣ing the <HI>Cane</HI> he had in his hand three times against the Ground, bid him in a great fury not <HI>to offer to speak to him, for that he knew his Heart well enough, and that he bore an ill will to all Christians; but there's another,</HI> said he, <HI>I blame more than you, and that's your Master, who, notwithstanding his being Brother in Arms to the King of</HI> Portugal, <HI>suffers me to be abused in his Country; but you may tell your Master from me, that the King of</HI> Portu∣gal <HI>shall know how I have been used by him, and that it will not be long before he shall smart for it.</HI> The <HI>Regedor</HI> desiring to appease him, did assure his <HI>Grace, That his Master knew nothing of what had been done to him at</HI> Diamper; <HI>and that so soon as he was acquainted with it, he would be sure to make Examples of all those that had any way af∣fronted his</HI> Grace. This put the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> in a greater Passion than he was in before; he said, <HI>This was all Trick, and that he had treated too
<PB N="90" REF="57"/> often with Kings, and knew their Tempers too well to be made believe, that they would not see themselves obeyed when they had a mind to it.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Regedor</HI> assured him a second time, that his Master always had, and always would favour his designs in the <HI>Serra, I shall quickly know that,</HI> said the Arch-Bishop, <HI>for if you be sincere, you will presently call all the Christians together, and Command them, in the King's Name to acknow∣ledge me as their Prelate, and to unite themselves to the Church of</HI> Rome. The <HI>Regedor</HI> promised to do it presently, and having called all the Christians together, commanded them before the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> on pain of the King's high displeasure, to obey the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> in all things, assuring them withal, that this was His Majesty's Will, and therefore they should give no credit to any that should whisper the contrary to them; and thus, by Hectoring and Bribing of Kings and their <HI>Regedores,</HI> the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> made both sudden and great Conversions.</P>
<P>Having dismissed the <HI>Regedor,</HI> the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> gave them a Sermon, and commanded them to come to Church next Morning to be confirmed by him. Next day after the Confirmation, he told them, <HI>That he had Excommunicated and De∣posed the</HI> Arch-Deacon, <HI>as a Rebel to the</HI> Pope, <HI>who is Christ's Vicar on Earth; and that he told them of it on purpose that they might have no more Communication with such a Rebel, but might ac∣knowledge him for their Prelate.</HI> The People seemed to be satisfied with what he had done,
<PB N="91" REF="57"/> and to blame the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> for his obstinacy. In the Evening he visited the Sick, and gave large Alms to the Widows and Orphans of the Town, telling them withal, that what he did was their Prelate's duty, and not to take Money from them as their former Bishops had done; but he forgot to tell them, that whereas their former Prelates had lived altogether upon Alms, having no settled Revenues to maintain them, by reason of their living under Princes who were <HI>Infidels,</HI> that he had above 20000 Crowns a Year in Rents that were certain. Besides, by having represented what he was doing in the <HI>Serra,</HI> as a great Service to the Crown, he had the Command of the Publick Treasure at <HI>Goa,</HI> which was never so great as at this time; the Viceroy <HI>Don Matthias de Albuquerque</HI> having in the Year 1597 left 80000 Ducats, and an im∣mense Summ in Jewels therein.</P>
<P>This <HI>Trick,</HI> for it deserves no better Name, together with his Hectoring of Kings and their <HI>Regedores</HI> as he did, made a great many People wish themselves under <HI>Portugueze</HI> Prelates, who, they saw, would not suffer their Princes to Ty∣rannize over them, but would espouse all their Quarrels, and defend them in their Rights, which was what the <HI>Chaldean</HI> Prelates were not able to do.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> now having by the foresaid Methods brought three such considerable places, as <HI>Carturte, Molandurte,</HI> and <HI>Diamper,</HI> besides se∣veral small Villages, under his Obedience; and
<PB N="92" REF="58"/> being also sure of all the Churches that are in the Kingdom of <HI>Porca, Gundara, Marca,</HI> and <HI>Batimena,</HI> whose Kings had already Commanded all their Subjects to obey him in every thing: The <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> hearing how things went, began to be sensible, that it would not be possible for him to contend with so powerful an Adversary much longer; and that he must therefore, either sub∣mit or be sent a Prisoner to <HI>Portugal,</HI> the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> having so blocked the <HI>Serra</HI> up to prevent a <HI>Chaldean</HI> Bishop's coming thither, that it was not possible for him to make his escape, if he had a mind to run his Country rather than renounce his Religion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> being informed by a <HI>Caçanar,</HI> that the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> was in great perplexity what he had best to do, writ him a long Letter, wherein among other things he cited him <HI>to ap∣pear before the Judgment-seat of God, to answer for the Souls that were now burning in Hell, by his ha∣ving kept them from being reconciled to the</HI> Roman <HI>Church, out of which there is no Salvation.</HI> To which Letter the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> returned an answer in a strain quite different from what he had writ in formerly.</P>
<P>Before this Letter came to his hand, the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> having done his work at <HI>Diamper,</HI> was sailed to <HI>Narame,</HI> a considerable Village of Chri∣stians, which he found all in Arms, having all bound themselves with an Oath never to forsake their Religion and <HI>Arch-Deacon,</HI> but to defend them with the last drop of their Blood; and so
<PB N="93" REF="58"/> when the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> was ready to Land to go to Church, they called to him to stay where he was; for besides that, the Church doors were shut, there was not one Person among them, who would have any Communication with him. Whereupon the <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> according to his Custom, sent immediately to the <HI>Regedor</HI> of the Country, which also belonged to the King of <HI>Cochim</HI> to come aboard, for that he had some∣thing to say to him.</P>
<P>What made the <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> making such great use of Kings and <HI>Regedores,</HI> who were all <HI>Infidels</HI> in the Conversion of these Christians to the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, the more unpardonable, was, that but a little before he had made the <HI>Arch-Deacon's interesting of</HI> Infidel <HI>Princes in the Af∣fairs of</HI> Christianity, with which they were not to be suffered to meddle, the chief Article for which he deserved to be deposed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Regedor</HI> being come aboard, the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> spoke to him to go ashoar, and do as much for him at <HI>Narame,</HI> as the chief <HI>Regedor</HI> had done at <HI>Molandurte</HI> and <HI>Diamper.</HI> The <HI>Regedor</HI> promised him he would, but when he came ashoar to cause the Church to be opened, there was no body left in the Town; for the Chri∣stians hearing of his coming, and what his busi∣ness was, had all hid themselves, that so they might not be constrained to break the Oath they had made so lately. The <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> when the <HI>Regedor</HI> brought him word how it was, was in a great Passion with him, and would not be per∣swaded
<PB N="94" REF="59"/> but that he had underhand fomented this division. But however these Christians came to be incensed against the <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> it is certain they were to that degree, that they denied him fresh Provisions for his Money, so that he was forc'd to live upon the <HI>Rice</HI> and <HI>Bisket</HI> that was aboard for some days.</P>
<P>While the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> was in this Diet, the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI>'s Letter came to his hand, the sub∣stance whereof was, <HI>That he was overcome at last by the irresistable force of Truth, and was resolved to submit himself to the</HI> Roman <HI>Church, intreating his</HI> Grace <HI>to pardon all the by past Errors of an igno∣rant Son.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> tho' he was extream glad at the news, would not discover that he was, but told the <HI>Caçanar</HI> that brought it very gravely, <HI>That he had been so often deceived by the</HI> Arch-Deacon, <HI>that he did not know how to trust him, and that he never would any more, before he had subscribed the Ten following Articles.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>That he abjured all the Errors of</HI> Nesto∣rius, <HI>and of all his Followers,</HI> Diodorus <HI>and</HI> The∣odorus (who, by the way, were both in their Graves before <HI>Nestorius</HI> was ever heard of) <HI>ac∣knowledging them to be cursed</HI> Hereticks, <HI>that are burning in Hell for their Errors.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>That he should confess there was but one Christian Law.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="95" REF="59"/>III. <HI>That he should subscribe the Confession of Faith, which he sent to him from</HI> Goa, <HI>when he made him Governour of the Bishoprick.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>That he should deliver all the Books of the Diocess to be amended or burnt according as they deserved.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>That he should swear Obedience to the</HI> Pope, <HI>as St.</HI> Peter<HI>'s Successor, and Christ's Vicar upon Earth, and the Supream Head of all Christians, and of all Bishops, Arch-Bishops, Primates and Patri∣archs in the World, so that none can be saved out of his obedience.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>That he should curse the Patriarch of</HI> Baby∣lon, <HI>as a</HI> Nestorian <HI>Heretick and Schismatick, and swear never to obey him any more in any matter, nor to have any further Commerce or Communica∣tion with him by Letters or otherwise.</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. <HI>That he should swear never to receive any Bishop or Prelate in the</HI> Serra, <HI>but what should be sent thither by the</HI> Pope, <HI>and to obey whomsoever he sent.</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. <HI>That he should swear to acknowledge and obey him for his</HI> true Prelate, <HI>as being made so by the</HI> Pope.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="96" REF="60"/>IX. <HI>That he should pass</HI> Olas <HI>or Provisions for the Assembling of a Diocesan Synod, to treat of all such matters, as the Arch-Bishop should think fit, and swear to be present at it himself.</HI></P>
<P N="10">X. <HI>That he should accompany the</HI> Arch-Bishop <HI>peaceably, wheresoever he went, without any thing of Guards, and should go along with him in his Galley to all the Churches he had a mind to visit.</HI></P>
<P>These Articles being made and signed by the <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> he delivered them to the <HI>Caçanar,</HI> together with a Letter, wherein he bid the <HI>Arch-Deacon,</HI> if he was not fully resolved to subscribe them, allowing him but twenty days to do it in, not to appear before him; and being wil∣ling to secure himself of the fidelity of the Bearer, he obliged him, before he dismiss'd him, to swear obedience to the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, ma∣king him swear also to return, and never to have any thing more to do with the <HI>Arch-Deacon,</HI> in case he refused to sign the Ar∣ticles.</P>
<P>Having dismissed this Messenger, the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> returned to <HI>Cochim,</HI> where his main bu∣siness was to get the Governour of the place to joyn with him, to press the King of <HI>Cochim</HI> to assist him cordially in his design of uniting the Church of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> to that of <HI>Rome;</HI> and while he was satisfying the Governour of
<PB N="97" REF="60"/> what Importance such an Union would be to the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Interest in the <HI>Indies,</HI> which was what he himself had all along as much in his Eye, as the Governour could have for his Heart: The King having heard of his being in Town, came very opportunely to pay him a visit, in which, before they parted, the King renewed his pro∣mise to him of commanding all his Christian Subjects to obey him in all things; with which promise the Arch-Bishop returned well satisfied to <HI>Cranganor,</HI> in order to settle the Affair of the Synod.</P>
<P>The day after his arrival there, he had Letters brought him by a <HI>Patamar,</HI> or Currier, from the King of <HI>Samorim,</HI> advising him of the King of <HI>Cochim</HI>'s having begun a War upon the <HI>Caimal</HI> or Prince of <HI>Corugeira</HI> his Allie, to which if a stop were not put suddenly, it would necessarily oblige him to withdraw his Army from before <HI>Cunahle,</HI> which was what the King of <HI>Cochim</HI> aimed at. So soon as the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> had read these Letters, he dispatched a Currier away im∣mediately after the King of <HI>Cochim,</HI> who was already on his March, desiring him not to make a War upon the <HI>Caimal</HI> till after <HI>Cunahle</HI> was taken, since it could not be done without di∣verting the <HI>Samorim</HI> from the Siege of <HI>Cunahle,</HI> who was then before it, expecting the return of the <HI>Portugueze Armada,</HI> which would be with him in the beginning of the Spring, he writ also to the Governour of <HI>Cochim,</HI> and the Commissioners of the <HI>Treasury</HI> to come to
<PB N="98" REF="61"/> him; whom, after some discourse about the bu∣siness, he ordered to go after the King of <HI>Cochim,</HI> and to stop him in his March.</P>
<P>Before the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> left <HI>Cranganor,</HI> he recei∣ved a Letter from the <HI>Arch-Deacon,</HI> wherein he wrote to him, <HI>That, tho' he was ready to subscribe all the Articles he had sent him, yet that it was not possible for him to wait upon His</HI> Grace <HI>in so short a time as he had fixed.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> understanding that the King of <HI>Mangate,</HI> in whose Country the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> was at that time, was very much against his submitting to him, sent a Servant of his own with a splendid Retinue to him, to let him know, <HI>That, if he should offer to hinder the Arch-Deacon from coming to him, the King of</HI> Portugal <HI>should know of it, who was resolved to revenge all the wrongs that were done to him in the</HI> Serra <HI>to the utmost of his Power.</HI> The King, who had too great a dependance on the <HI>Portuguezes,</HI> to pro∣voke one of the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI>'s Character and Spi∣rit, sent him word, <HI>That the</HI> Arch-Deacon <HI>migh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wait upon him when he pleased for all him, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that he never had any thoughts of hindring him</HI> For all that, the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> did not come having in truth no Stomach to the morsel th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> had prepared for him. Whereupon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> sent a couple of <HI>Jesuites</HI> to him, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> let him know, <HI>That that was his last admonitio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and that if he did not come to him in eight da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="99" REF="61"/> he would infallibly depose him and put another in his place.</HI></P>
<P>The Governour and Commissioners having prevailed with the King of <HI>Cochim</HI> to desist from the War; the King, in his return home, resolved to take <HI>Cranganor</HI> in his way. The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> having received advice that he was ready to Land, was civiler to him than he had been for∣merly, and went to the <HI>Caiz,</HI> of the Castle to meet him, and after some Complements had passed on both sides, they went together to an <HI>Hermitage</HI> that was not far off. Where they discoursed alone for a considerable time; after which the King called in his chief <HI>Regedor,</HI> and several of his Nobles, and the <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> the Captain of the Castle, and some of his own Servants. Before whom the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> thanked His <HI>Highness</HI> for having desisted from the War of <HI>Corugeira,</HI> promising him thanks also from the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> for it, but told him withal, <HI>That this must not hinder him from acquainting His Highness with his being much dissatisfied at his having used him so as he had done.</HI> The King desired His <HI>Lordship to tell for what he was displeased, there being nothing that he was so desi∣rous of, as to satisfie him in all things.</HI> The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> told him with a frowning Coun∣tenance, <HI>That when his Brother in Arms, the King of</HI> Portugal, <HI>sent him into the</HI> Serra, <HI>he ex∣pected he should have been defended there by His</HI> Highness, <HI>and not only so but that he would have assisted him to the utmost in the Pious design he
<PB N="100" REF="62"/> came about; in confidence of which Protection and Assistance it was that he left</HI> Goa <HI>to come into those Parts, but that he had found himself misera∣bly deceived, there not being a Prince in</HI> Malabar, <HI>in whose Dominions he had been</HI> (and he had been in the most of them) <HI>but what had shewed him more favour than His</HI> Highness, <HI>who had loaded some of his Christian Subjects with Taxes, for no other reason, but for having given him a kind Reception.</HI> Here the chief <HI>Regedor</HI> interposed, and desired him <HI>to let His</HI> Majesty <HI>know what the Affronts or Injuries were that he had received in any part of his Dominions.</HI> The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> re∣plied with great passion, <HI>Sir, There is no Body knows them all better than you do, since they were done before your Eyes; however, you were pleased to wink at them; nay, I do not know but you might have a hand in procuring them; and therefore pray do not you offer to conceal them from your Master.</HI> The King protested he had never heard of any Injury or Affront that had been put upon His <HI>Lordship</HI> in any part of his Territories. The <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> without any Ceremony, told him, <HI>It was not so, for that he himself had ac∣quainted His</HI> Highness <HI>several times by Letter, of what he suffered from his Subjects, but could never have them remedied as he expected, and as they ought to have been by one that owed so much to the</HI> Portugueze <HI>as His</HI> Highness <HI>did, wherefore,</HI> said he, <HI>for the future I'll complain of none but my own King, for having sent me from a Palace at</HI> Goa, <HI>where I lived at my ease and in splendor, to wander
<PB N="101" REF="62"/> about the</HI> Serra, <HI>and be abused as I have been.</HI> This does not agree very well with what is said before of his going into the <HI>Serra</HI> purely out of Zeal and Devotion, and contrary to all that the <HI>Viceroy</HI> and others could say or do to hinder him; but upon his upbraiding the King with his not having answered his expectations, nor the obliga∣tions which he owed to the <HI>Portuguezes,</HI> who, of a petty Prince, had made him a great Monarch; the King ask'd him, as well he might, <HI>what his</HI> Lordship <HI>meant,</HI> desiring him <HI>to instance in what particulars he had been thus aggrieved;</HI> whereupon the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> told him of what had been done at <HI>Molandurte</HI> and <HI>Diamper,</HI> and charged him with having encouraged the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> in his Rebellion, to whom he had granted several <HI>Ollas</HI> or Provisions, without having granted him one as yet. The King told him he would treat with the Governour of <HI>Cochim</HI> about an <HI>Olla</HI> for his <HI>Lordship.</HI> This put the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> in a much greater passion than he was in before: for he reckoned the King slighted him, in saying he would treat with the Governour about a thing that was his immediate concern; whereupon he told his <HI>Majesty, That it had been always his custom to put him off with delays, that for his own part he desired none of his</HI> Ollas; <HI>and that the Christians of St.</HI> Thomas, <HI>if they had been true Christians, would never have suffered their Kings to have meddled with matters of Religion; but especially being</HI> Infidels <HI>and</HI> Idolaters, <HI>as he was, and who not knowing the true God, Worshipp'd Stocks and Stones, and Devils in∣stead
<PB N="102" REF="63"/> of him: That for his part he could not but wonder at His</HI> Highness<HI>'s taking upon him to fa∣vour the Patriarch of</HI> Babylon <HI>against the</HI> Pope, <HI>who understood nothing of the difference between them; That His</HI> Highness <HI>would do well therefore to leave his Christian Subjects to him, who was their true Prelate, and not to meddle with matters he did not understand: That as for the</HI> Arch-Deacon <HI>he had determined that if he did not come and submit to him by next</HI> Saturday, <HI>to turn him out of his place, and put another into it, and that he could not but look upon the</HI> Arch-Deacon <HI>as an ill Christian, if for no other reason, for that of having communi∣cated the Affairs of</HI> Christianity <HI>to His</HI> Highness, <HI>whom all the World know to be an Infidel.</HI> The King was desperately angry at what the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> had said of his <HI>Idols;</HI> however being a very wise Prince he did not touch upon that string, but told him, His <HI>Lordship</HI> might expect the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> one <HI>Saturday,</HI> two <HI>Saturdays,</HI> and three <HI>Saturdays.</HI> The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> took the words out of his Mouth, and striking his <HI>Cane</HI> against the Ground in great Fury, said, <HI>I will not expect him one, two, and three</HI> Saturdays, <HI>but if I live I will depose him if he does not come and submit before the next, and that he deserved to be Deposed, if for no other reason, for his having interested His</HI> High∣ness <HI>in the concerns of</HI> Christianity, <HI>notwithstand∣ing he knew him to be an</HI> Infidel. The King, who could not help standing amazed at the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> condemning the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> so much for endeavouring to interest him in a thing which
<PB N="103" REF="63"/> he himself at the same time was swaggering him into, perceiving that the more they talked, the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> grew the more furious, and talked the louder, put on a pleasant Countenance, and told him with great sweetness, <HI>That there was nothing he had ever studied so much as to please His Lordship.</HI> With this the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI>'s Passion be∣ing something mitigated, he replied, <HI>It was what he had always expected from His</HI> Highness, <HI>and that he hoped he would not wonder to see him put into so great a Passion, in a case wherein Christianity was so much concerned, for the least of whose Interest he was bound in duty to sacrifice his Head.</HI> The King told him, <HI>That if he knew of any that sought after his Head, they should not keep their own long upon their Shoulders.</HI> After they had made an end of this hot business, they talked for some time of indifferent matters; and when the King was for going, the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> accompanied him to the <HI>Caiz,</HI> where they are said to have parted very good Friends; which if they did, the King con∣sidering how he had been treated, was certainly the best natured Prince that ever wore a Crown, and in a very substantial point a much better Christian than the <HI>Arch-Bishop.</HI></P>
<P>This rancounter was of no small advantage to the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> in the reduction of that <HI>Christi∣anity;</HI> for the King fearing to provoke one of the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI>'s Character and Temper, so soon as he had left him, writ away immediately to the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> to come and submit himself to the <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> he writ also to the King of <HI>Mangate,</HI>
<PB N="104" REF="64"/> in case he found the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> not willing to do it, to oblige him to it.</P>
<P>Upon the receipt of this Letter the <HI>Arch-Dea∣con</HI> sent away immediately to the <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> to let him know, That he was ready to throw him∣self at his <HI>Grace</HI>'s Feet, and to obey all his Com∣mands, and that within the time he had prefixed; but withal, desired to wait upon him some where else than in <HI>Cranganor,</HI> which being a Fortress belonging to the <HI>Portuguezes,</HI> he was afraid to trust himself in, there being nothing that he dreaded so much as being some time or other kidnapped for <HI>Goa.</HI> However the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> complyed so far with his Fears as to order him to meet him at the <HI>Jesuites</HI>-College in <HI>Vaipicotta.</HI> They met first in the Church, where the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> threw himself at the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI>'s Feet, with the words of the <HI>Prodigal</HI> in his mouth, <HI>Fa∣ther, I have sinned against Heaven, and against thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son. I do humbly beg Pardon for all my Errors, which have been great.</HI> The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> lifting him up and embracing him tenderly, told him, all that was past was forgot; and that God's Mercy in reducing him to the <HI>Catholick Church</HI> was greater than the Malice of the Devil, which had been the cause of his returning no sooner, that he would certainly have that great Reward that is reserved in Heaven for those that bring so many Souls to the purity of the Faith, as he was confi∣dent he would do by his Example; that he would therefore have him subscribe the Profession of
<PB N="105" REF="64"/> Faith and ten Articles immediately. The <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> beg'd to speak one word first with His <HI>Grace</HI> in private, promising, after that to do whatsoever His <HI>Grace</HI> should command him; and being alone, he told him, That if His <HI>Grace</HI> would have it so, he was ready to subscribe the Profession and Ar∣ticles publickly, tho', with submission he thought it would be better if he would allow him to do it in private, for the sake of that Christianity who were not as yet so well instructed as they ought to be; but that before the meeting of the Synod, at which he promised to sign them publickly, he hoped to be able to prepare them for the recei∣ving of whatsoever should be therein determined, which he believed he should be able to do the more effectually, if they knew nothing of his having already submitted to the <HI>Roman Church.</HI> The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> answered, <HI>That notwithstanding a Profession of the Faith was by so much the better, as it was the more publick, nevertheless he so far approved of his Reason as to dispense with his ma∣king it openly.</HI> Whereupon they and the Jesuite <HI>Francisco Roz</HI> repaired to the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI>'s Lodg∣ings, and having shut the doors, the <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> kneeled down before a <HI>Crucifix</HI> that stood on the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI>'s Table, and laying his hands upon the <HI>Missal,</HI> swore to the Ten Articles, and to the Profession of Faith, to which the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> obliged him to put his hand, to prevent his de∣nying it afterwards.</P>
<P>Next Morning all the <HI>Caçanares</HI> being called to∣gether, the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> acquainted them with his
<PB N="106" REF="65"/> intention of calling a Synod very speedily, which they all agreed to. It was then debated where it should meet, some were for its being held at <HI>Angamale,</HI> the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of the Diocess, but the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> would not hear of its being held there for three Reasons; the first was, That the Christians of <HI>Angamale</HI> were the Christians of the whole Bishoprick that were most addicted to their old Religion, <HI>Secondly,</HI> It was not in the Domi∣nions of the King of <HI>Cochim,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Malabar</HI> that had the greatest dependence upon the <HI>Portu∣guezes;</HI> And <HI>Lastly,</HI> Because it was at too great a distance from the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Garrison of <HI>Cochim.</HI> It was carried therefore that it should be held in the Town of <HI>Diamper,</HI> which was but a little way from <HI>Cochim,</HI> and should begin on the 20th. of <HI>June,</HI> being the 3d. <HI>Sunday</HI> after <HI>Whitsuntide.</HI></P>
<P>In pursuance whereof the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> and <HI>Arch-Deacon</HI> did both issue forth their <HI>Ollas,</HI> command∣ing all Priests and Procurators of the People, who were four from every Town, to assemble toge∣ther at the Town of <HI>Diamper,</HI> on the 20th. of <HI>June</HI> next, there to celebrate a Diocesan Synod. The <HI>Ollas</HI> bore date the 11th. of <HI>May,</HI> so that there were six Weeks allowed for the preparing of business, which the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> made good use of.</P>
<P>Before the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> left <HI>Vaipicotta,</HI> the <HI>Caimal</HI> of <HI>Angamale,</HI> who was called the <HI>black King</HI> of <HI>Malabar,</HI> came to give him a visit: The <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> received him kindly, and at parting pre∣sented him with some pieces of very rich Cloath;
<PB N="107" REF="65"/> which was what he went well furnished withal from <HI>Goa,</HI> having laid out 18000 <HI>Pardaos</HI> in Goods, to make Presents of in the <HI>Serra.</HI> The <HI>Caimal,</HI> who was a boisterous and bloody Prince, was so well pleased with his Present, that he pro∣mised the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> to see him obeyed in all things.</P>
<P>After which the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> returned to <HI>Cran∣ganor,</HI> where he composed the Decrees of the Synod, which were all writ with his own Hand, word for word as they are published. As soon as he had finished them he had them translated out of <HI>Portugueze</HI> into <HI>Malavar.</HI> He likewise Consecrated there a Stone Altar for every Church in the <HI>Serra,</HI> which was what they all wanted.</P>
<P>What remained to be done, after having en∣gaged all the Neighbouring Princes, and their <HI>Regedors</HI> to assist him, was to secure the <HI>Major</HI> Vote in the Synod; and in order thereunto he Ordained no fewer than fifty Priests on <HI>Trinity-Sunday,</HI> in the Church of <HI>Paru,</HI> which fifty being added to the thirty eight he had Ordained but a little before at <HI>Diamper,</HI> and to those he had Ordained at <HI>Carturte,</HI> who are said to have been many, must make up at least two thirds of the Priests that were present at the Synod, who in all were but 153. of which two thirds the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> was secure, having before he Or∣dained them, made them abjure their old Reli∣gion, and subscribe the Creed of <HI>Pius</HI> IV.</P>
<P>He was also industrious to secure to himself the Votes of several of the most considerable among
<PB N="108" REF="66"/> the <HI>Procurators,</HI> by making them great Presents, giving to one of them a Cross set with <HI>Diamonds</HI> of great value, as he did another of equal price, to an old <HI>Caçanar,</HI> who had been a great Com∣panion of Arch-Bishop <HI>Mar Abraham.</HI> Upon which, and the other Precautions made use of by the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> to compass his ends in the Synod, Father <HI>Simon</HI> in his 109 Pag. of his <HI>Historie Critique,</HI> makes the following judicious reflection: <HI>All that these methods have hitherto produced, serves only to let the World see by what means the</HI> Roman <HI>Religion has been established in the</HI> East, <HI>which he that knows will not wonder, that all the re-unions which have been made with those People we call</HI> Schismaticks <HI>in those Parts, have been so short lived.</HI></P>
<P>On the 9th. of <HI>June</HI> the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> accompa∣nied with six <HI>Jesuites</HI> and his Confessor, who were all Divines, and several <HI>Caçanares,</HI> arrived at <HI>Diamper,</HI> where he immediately erected a <HI>Junto</HI> of eight of the most popular <HI>Caçanares,</HI> before whom he laid the Decrees, desiring their opini∣on of them; and when they came to consider the Decrees relating to manners, he called four of the gravest of the <HI>Procurators</HI> also to be present at the Examination of them; after some Debates the Decrees were all agreed to by the <HI>Junto,</HI> which, for that reason, was given out to be the Author of them.</P>
<P>On the 20th. of <HI>June</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>99. the Synod was opened, at which solemnity were present the <HI>Dean</HI> and <HI>Chapter</HI> of <HI>Cochim,</HI> with their whole <HI>Quire,</HI> as also the Governour, the Commissioners of the
<PB N="109" REF="66"/> <HI>Treasury,</HI> and the Chamber of the same City, and several other <HI>Portuguezes</HI> of Quality.</P>
<P>I will detain the Reader no longer from the perusal of the Synod it self, in which he is not to wonder if he meets with the whole mass of <HI>Popery,</HI> considering that all its Decrees were com∣posed by a Popish <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> who assembled it on purpose to establish the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion in the <HI>Serra;</HI> in the doing whereof, tho' he was in∣strumental in letting the World know more of the Orthodoxy of that Apostolical Church, than its like they would ever have known of it other∣wise, we have reason to bless Providence, but none at all to thank him for it, who intended nothing less than the making of such a happy dis∣covery.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Synod is printed at the end of the History of <HI>Dom Frey Aleixo de Menezes,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Goa</HI>'s Visitation of the Christians of Saint <HI>Thomas</HI> in the <HI>Serra</HI> or Mountain of <HI>Malabar,</HI> made immediately after the Celebration, and in pursuance of the Order of the said Sy∣nod; the History of which Visitation was compos'd by <HI>Antonio de Gouvea,</HI> an <HI>Austin Friar,</HI> and Reader of Divinity in <HI>Goa,</HI> at the Command of the Provincial of his Order in <HI>Portugal.</HI> It contains divers things that are fit for all Protestants to know; namely, the rude and boisterous Methods, that the <HI>Roman</HI> Prelates, where they may do it with safety, make use of in the Reduction of those
<PB REF="69"/> they call <HI>Hereticks;</HI> together with clear Con∣firmations of the Truth of what we meet with in the Fourteenth, and other Decrees of the Third Action of this Synod; to wit, That the Three great Doctrines of Popery, the <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Supremacy, Transubstantiation,</HI> the <HI>Adoration of Images,</HI> were never believed nor practised at any time in this ancient Apo∣stolical Church; but, on the contrary, were rejected and condemned by her, and that in her Publick Offices. So that upon what we learn from this Synod and History, I think one may venture to say, That before the time of the late Reformation, there was no Church that we know of, no not that of the <HI>Vaudois,</HI> abating that one thing of her being infected with the Heresie of <HI>Nestorius,</HI> of which too she is cleared by one of the <HI>Roman</HI> Communion, that had so Few Er∣rors in Doctrine, as the Church of <HI>Ma∣labar.</HI></P>
<P>If the Synod I here publish should be well received, as I have reason to hope it will, by all Protestants, and lovers of Truth, upon the account of the clear Discoveries
<PB REF="69"/> it makes of the forementioned Popish Er∣rors, having never been at any time the Doctrines of the Universal Church, which we know is confidently affirmed, and much boasted of; and for further satisfaction in so important a Matter, the above-named History should be desired, I shall be rea∣dy to translate and publish it with all ex∣pedition, alone, and in the same Volume with this of the Synod; together with the best Account I can procure of the Church of <HI>Malabar,</HI> and the other Oriental Churches, that were never within the Bounds of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire; for it is in those Churches that we are to expect to meet with the least of the Leaven of Popery.</P>
<P>As to the Synod, to prevent all surmises of its being a Piece either forged by some Protestant, or of no Authority in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> tho' set forth by a Member of her Communion; I have, together with the whole Title Page, which tells where, when, and by whom it was printed, translated and published all the <HI>Licences</HI> that it came out with: And if any should suspect the Trans∣lation,
<PB REF="70"/> if they please, they may satisfie them∣selves of its Fidelity, by having recourse to the Original in the <HI>Bodleian Library</HI> at <HI>Ox∣ford;</HI> to which, as the safest, as well as no∣blest Repository of Books in the World, I design to give it.</P>
<P>I have here and there added some short Remarks upon some Passages, which will not, I hope, be unacceptable to the Rea∣der.</P>

<P>SHe is said, 1. Not to adore Images. 2. To hold but Three Sacraments, Baptism, the Eu∣charist, and Order. 3. To make no use of Oils. 4. To have had no Knowledge of Confirmation or Extream Unction. 5. To abhor Auricular Confession. 6. To hold many enormous Errors about the Eucharist, insomuch that the Author of the History saith, he is inclined to believe, that the <HI>Hereticks</HI> of our Times, meaning Pro∣testants, the revivers of all forgotten Errors, and Ignorances, might have had their Doctrine a∣bout the Eucharist from them. 7. To Ordain such as have been married several times, and to Widows, and to approve of her Priests marry∣ing as often as they have a mind. 8. That she abhors the Pope and the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> as Anti-Christian, in pretending to a Superiority and Ju∣risdiction over all other Churches.</P>

<HEAD>THE PUBLICATION and CALLING OF THE SYNOD.</HEAD>
<P>DOM <HI>Frey Aleixo de Menezes,</HI> by the mercy of God, and the Holy <HI>Roman</HI> See, Archbishop, Metropolitan of <HI>Goa,</HI> Pri∣mate of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and the Oriental Parts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To the Reverend in Christ, Father <HI>George,</HI> Archdeacon of the Christians of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> in the <HI>Serra</HI> of the Kingdom of <HI>Malabar,</HI> and to all other Priests, Curates, Deacons and Subdeacons, and to all Towns, Villages, and Hamlets, and to all Chri∣stian People of the said Bishoprick, Health in our Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>We give you all, and every one of you in parti∣cular to understand, that the most Holy Father Pope <HI>Clement VIII.</HI> our Lord Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> and Vi∣car of our Lord Jesus Christ upon earth, at this time presiding in the Church of God; having sent two
<PB N="90" REF="73"/> Briefs directed to Ʋs, one of the <HI>27th.</HI> of <HI>Jan.</HI> in the Year <HI>1595,</HI> and the other of the <HI>21st.</HI> of the same Month, in the Year <HI>1597;</HI> in which, by virtue of his Pastoral Office, and that Ʋniversal Power be∣queathed to the Supream, Holy and Apostolical Chair of St. <HI>Peter</HI> over all the Churches in the World, by Jesus Christ the Son of God our Lord and Redeemer, he commanded us upon the death of the Archbishop <HI>Mar-Abraham,</HI> to take Possession of this Church and Bi∣shoprick, so as not to suffer any Bishop or Prelate coming from <HI>Babylon,</HI> to enter therein, as has been hitherto the Custom, all that come from thence being Schismaticks, Hereticks, and <HI>Nestorians,</HI> out of the Obedience of the Holy <HI>Roman</HI> Church, and Subject to the Patriarch of <HI>Babylon,</HI> the Head of the said Heresy; and to appoint a Governour or Apostolical Vicar to Rule the said Diocess both in Spirituals and Temporals, until such time as the Holy <HI>Roman</HI> Church shall provide it of a proper Pastor; which being read by us, we were desirous to execute the Apostolical Mandates with due Reverence and Obe∣dience; besides, that the same was incumbent on us of right (the said Church having no Chapter to take care of it during the vacancy of the See) as Metro∣politan and Primate of this and all the other Churches of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and the Oriental Parts.</P>
<P>But perceiving that our Mandate in that behalf had no effect, what we had ordered, not having been obeyed in the said Diocess, so that what our most Holy Father, the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> had designed, was like to be frustrated, after having laboured therein for the space of two Years, Schism and Disobedience to
<PB N="91" REF="73"/> the Apostolical See, having been so rooted in that Diocess for a great many Years, that the Inhabi∣tants thereof, instead of yielding Obedience to the Apostolical, and Our Mandates; on the contrary upon the intimation thereof, did daily harden themselves more and more, committing greater Offences against the Obedience due to the Holy <HI>Roman</HI> Church; af∣ter having commended the Matter to God, and or∣dered the same to be done through our whole Diocess, and after mature Advice, by which Methods the Apostolical Mandates might be best executed; and being also moved by the Piety of the People, and the Mercy God had shewn them in having preserved so many thousand Souls in the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, from the time that the Holy Apostle St. <HI>Tho∣mas</HI> had Preached to them until this day, notwith∣standing their having lived among so many Heathens, and been scattered in divers places, their Churches and all belonging to them, having been al∣ways subject to Idolatrous Kings and Princes, and incompassed with Idols and Pagods, and that with∣out holding any correspondence with any other Chri∣stians before the coming of the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> into these Parts; we being likewise desirous that the La∣bours of the Holy Apostle St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> which still remained among them, should not be lost for want of sound Doctrine; and that the Apostolical Mandates might not be frustrated, did determine, and having provided for the Government of our own Church during our absence, did prepare to go in Person to take Possession of the said Bishoprick, to see if by our Presence we might be able to reduce them to
<PB N="92" REF="74"/> the Obedience of the Holy <HI>Roman</HI> Church, and purge out the Heresies and false Doctrines sown among them, and introduced by the Schismatical Prelates, and <HI>Nestorian</HI> Hereticks that had governed them under the Obedience of the Patriarch of <HI>Babylon;</HI> as also to call in and purge the Books containing those Heresies; and according to our Pastoral Du∣ty, so far as God should enable us, to Preach to them in Person the Catholick Truth.</P>
<P>Accordingly going into the said Bishoprick, we set a∣bout visiting the Churches thereof; but at that time Satan, the great Enemy of the good of Souls, having stirred up great Commotions, and much opposition against this our just intent, great numbers depart∣ing from us, and forming a Schism against the Holy <HI>Roman</HI> Church, after having passed through many troubles and dangers, out of all which God of his great mercy, not remembring our sins and evil deeds, was pleased to deliver us, and to grant us an intire Peace for the Merits of the glorious Apostle St. <HI>Thomas</HI> the Patron of this Christianity, but chiefly of his own great Clemency and Mercy, which makes, that <HI>he doth not delight in the death of a sinner, but rather that he should return and live;</HI> and by coming all to the light of the Truth, may joyn with us in the Confession of the Catholick Faith, approving our Doctrine and Intention, and submitting themselves to the Obedience of the Holy <HI>Roman</HI> Church; which being by us observed, after having returned Thanks to God, we thought fit, in order to the compassing and securing of all those good Effects, to assemble a <HI>Diocesan Synod</HI> in some com∣modious
<PB N="93" REF="74"/> place near the middle of the said Diocess, there to Treat of all such Matters as are convenient for the honour of God, the exaltation of the Holy Catholick Faith and Divine Worship, the good of the Church, the extirpation of Vice, the Reforma∣tion of the Christians of the said Diocess, and the profit and peace of their Souls; to which end ha∣ving pitched upon the Town and Church of <HI>Diam∣per,</HI></P>
<P>We do hereby let all the Inhabitants and Christi∣ans of the said Bishoprick, as well Ecclesiasticks as Laicks, of what State or Condition soever, to un∣derstand, that we do call and assemble a Diocesan Synod in the said Town of <HI>Diamper,</HI> on the 20th. of <HI>June</HI> of this present Year <HI>1599,</HI> being the Third <HI>Sunday</HI> after <HI>Whitsuntide;</HI> and do therefore, by Virtue of holy Obedience, and upon pain of Excom∣munication, <HI>latae Sententiae,</HI> Command the Reverend the Arch-Deacon of this Diocess, and all the other Priests of the same, that shall not be hindered by Age, or some other just Impediment, to be present in the said Town of <HI>Diamper,</HI> there with us to ce∣lebrate a <HI>Diocesan Synod</HI> conformable to the Holy Canons: And whereas by immemorial Custom, and a Right introduced into this Diocess from its Begin∣ning, and consented to by all the Infidel Kings of <HI>Malabar,</HI> the whole Government as it were, and the Cognizance of all Matters wherein Christians are a∣ny ways concerned, has belonged to the Church, and the Prelate thereof; and it having likewise been an ancient Custom in the same, to give an Account to the People of whatsoever has been ordained in
<PB N="94" REF="75"/> the Church, in order to its being the better observed by all: We do therefore under the same Precept and Censure, command all Christians in all Towns and Villages of this Bishoprick; and where there are no Villages, all that use to assemble together at any Church as belonging to it, immediately upon this our Pleasure being intimated to them, to chuse Four of the most Honourable, Conscientious, and Ex∣perienced Persons among them, to come in their Name at the said time, to the said Synod, with sufficient Powers to Approve, Sign, Confirm, and Consult in their Name, so as to oblige themselves thereby to comply with whatsoever shall be deter∣mined in the Synod. And that these Commissioners may demand or propose whatsoever they shall judge to be of Importance to the Synod, and for the Spiri∣tual or Temporal Good of their People; We do grant free Liberty to all in this Diocess, as well Ecclesia∣sticks as Laicks, that have any Complaints, Grie∣vances, or Controversies about any such Matters as are decidable by the Prelate, or other Christians, to represent the same to the Synod; where they shall be heard with Patience, and have Justice done them according to the Sacred Canons, Customs, and lawful Ʋsages of the Country.</P>
<P>And whereas we are informed that there are se∣veral things in this Bishoprick which are the Causes of great Contentions, we do therefore not only give leave, but do also admonish and command all that are concerned in any such Matters, that forbearing all other ways that are prejudicial to Christiani∣ty,
<PB N="95" REF="75"/> they do now make use of this just and holy way of putting an end to all their Debates: And since to bring all these things to a good issue the favour and assistance of God is necessary, from whom all good things do proceed, and without whom we can do nothing, wherefore to engage the Di∣vine Clemency by Prayer to be favourable to us, following the laudable Custom of the Holy Fathers, and Ancient Councils, we do Admonish, and in the Name of God earnestly request, all the faithful Christians of this Bishoprick, from this time for∣ward until the end of the Synod, to exercise them∣selves with a pure and clean heart, in Fasting, Alms, Prayer, and other works of Piety, instant∣ly beseeching God to enlighten the Ʋnderstandings of all that shall meet together, and so to enflame our Wills with Divine Love, that we may determine nothing but what is right, and may observe and comply with whatsoever shall be Decreed; taking for our Intercessor, our Lady the most Holy Vir∣gin <HI>Mary,</HI> of whose Praise and Honour we are to Treat particularly; as also the Glorious Apostle St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> the Master, Patron, and Protector of this Church; and all the other Saints in Hea∣ven, that so this Synod may begin, and proceed in Peace and universal Concord, and may end to the Praise, Honour, and Glory of God our Lord for ever.

<PB N="99" REF="77"/> which his Holiness had recommended to him the Government of that Church, after the death of the Arch-Bishop <HI>Marabran,</HI> until such time as it should be provided of a Pastor and Prelate; besides, that the same belonged to him as the Me∣tropolitan thereof, and Primate of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and all the Oriental Parts, by the Canons, the See thereof being vacant, and it having no Chap∣ter to take care of it during the vacancy; which Briefs being faithfully translated into the <HI>Mala∣bar</HI> Tongue, were immediately read, and recei∣ved with that Reverence and Obedience that was due to them: After which the Lord Metro∣politan told them, That seeing he had but little knowledge of the <HI>Malabar</HI> Tongue, it was ne∣cessary for him to have some faithful Person, and that was well versed in Ecclesiastical Affairs, to relate truly in the Congregations what he should say, or what should be spoke to him: Where∣upon upon <HI>Jacob,</HI> a Priest, and Curate of the Church of <HI>Pallurte</HI> in the said Bishoprick, a Person well skilled both in the <HI>Portugueze</HI> and <HI>Malabar</HI> Lan∣guages, was presently pitched upon by common Consent; who being called by the Lord Metropo∣litan, was charged by him with the Office of In∣terpreter to himself and the Holy Synod, giving him an Oath at the same time upon the Holy Gospels, well and faithfully to discharge the said Office, and truly and exactly to relate all that should be said by his Lordship or any other Per∣son in the Synod, without any addition or dimi∣nution; as also to read in the Congregations
<PB N="100" REF="78"/> all the Decrees and Determinations of the Synod, which were to be in the <HI>Malabar</HI> Tongue: And whereas Truth it self has testified, That in the mouth of two or three there is all Truth; there∣fore for the greater security, there were given to the said Interpreter, by the most Reverend Me∣tropolitan, as Assistants, the Reverend Fathers,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">He was afterwards made Bishop of the Christians of St. <HI>Tho∣mas.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Francisco Roz,</HI> and <HI>Antonio Tos∣cano</HI> of the Society of Jesus in the College of <HI>Vaipicotta</HI> in this Diocess, who being well skilled in the <HI>Malabar</HI> Tongue, were to ob∣serve all that was related by the Interpreter, and in case he was at any time faulty, to correct him; there were besides several others present, Natives as well as <HI>Portuguezes,</HI> that were well vers'd in both Languages.</P>

<P>I <HI>N.</HI> do of my own free Will, without any manner of force and constraint, for the Salva∣tion of my Soul, believing it in my heart, pro∣test, that with a firm Faith I do believe, and confess, all and every one of the Articles con∣tained in the Symbol of Faith which is used in Holy Mother <HI>Roman</HI> Church.</P>
<Q REND="italic"><P>I believe in one God the Father Almighty, Ma∣ker of Heaven and Earth, and of all things visible and invisible:</P>
<P>And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, begotten of his Father before all Worlds; God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made: Who for
<PB N="108" REF="82"/> us Men, and for our Salvation, came down from Heaven, and was Incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and was made Man, and was Crucified also for us under <HI>Pontius Pilate;</HI> He suffered and was buried, and the third day he rose again according to the Scriptures, and ascended into Heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of the Father, and he shall come again with Glory to Judge both the Quick and the Dead: whose Kingdom shall have no end.</P>
<P>And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and giver of Life, who proceedeth from the Father, and the Son, who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified, who spake by the Pro∣phets. And I believe one Catholick and Apostolick Church; I acknowledge one Baptism, for the remissi∣on of Sins; and I look for the Resurrection of the Dead; and the Life of the World to come.</P></Q>
<P>I do firmly receive and embrace all Apostoli∣cal and Ecclesiastical Traditions, and all the Ob∣servances and Constitutions of the said Church; I admit the Holy Scriptures in that sence wherein it has ever been, and is still held by Mother Church, to whom it belongeth to judge of the true Sence and Interpretation of the Holy Scrip∣tures; neither will I either receive or interpret it but according to the unanimous consent of the Fathers.</P>
<P>I do confess likewise, that there are Seven true and proper Sacraments of the New Testament, instituted by Christ our Lord, which are all neces∣sary
<PB N="109" REF="82"/> to the health of Mankind, tho' not to every particular Person; they are, Baptism, Confirma∣tion, the Eucharist, Order, Penance, Matrimo∣ny, and Extream Unction, which do all conferr Grace on those that receive them worthily; and of these seven Sacraments, that Baptism, Confir∣mation, and Orders, are to be received but once, neither can they be repeated without great Sa∣crilege.</P>
<P>I admit and receive all the Customs, Rites, and Ceremonies, received and approved of in the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, in the solemn Administration of the said seven Sacraments, and do also receive and embrace all in general, and every thing in particular, that has been defined and declared concerning Original Sin, and Justification, in the Holy Council of <HI>Trent.</HI></P>
<P>I do likewise confess, that in the <HI>Mass</HI> there is offer'd to God a true and proper Sacrifice of Pardon both for the Quick and the Dead; and that in the most Holy Sacrament of the Eu∣charist, there is the true, real, and substantial Body and Blood, together with the Soul and Di∣vinity of our Lord Jesus Christ; and that the whole substance of the Bread is by Conse∣cration turned into the Body of Christ, and the whole substance of the Wine into his Blood; which Conversion the Catholick Church calls <HI>Transubstantiation:</HI> Moreover, I do confess, that under each Species Christ is entire, and the true Sacrament is received.</P>

<P>I do acknowledge the Holy, Catholick, and Apostolick <HI>Roman</HI> Church to be the Head, Mo∣ther and Mistress of all other Churches in the World; and do hold all that are not subject and obedient to her, to be Heretical, Schismatical, and disobedient to our Lord Jesus Christ, and his Commands, and to the Order that he left in the Church, and to be Aliens from Eternal Salvation.</P>

<P>I do likewise confess and believe, that in pure Christianity there is only one Law of our Lord Jesus Christ, true God, and true Man; in like manner as there is no more than one only true God, one only Faith, and one only Baptism; which one only Law was preached by all the holy Apostles, and their Disciples and Successors after the same manner.

<HEAD>CHAP. I. The Doctrine of Faith.</HEAD>
<P>OUr Holy Faith, that is believed with one una∣nimous consent by the Catholick Church spread all over the World, is, That we believe in One only True, Almighty, Immutable, In∣comprehensible, and Ineffable God, the Eternal Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, One in Essence, and Three in Persons; the Father not begotten, the Son begotten of the Father, and of the same substance with him, and equal to him, and the Holy Ghost proceeding eternally from the Fa∣ther and the Son; not as from two Principals, or two Inspirations, but from both as from one only Principal, and one only Inspiration; the Father is not the Son, nor the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit is not the Father, nor the Son; but the Father is only the Father, the Son is only the Son, and the Holy Spirit is only the Holy Spirit, none of them being before another in Eternity, nor superiour to another in Majesty, nor inferi∣our to another in Power, but were all without beginning or end; the Father is he who begot, the Son is he who was born, and the Holy Ghost he who proceedeth, Consubstantial, Equal, alike Almighty, and alike Eternal. These three Per∣sons are one only God, and not three Gods, one
<PB N="122" REF="89"/> only Essence and Substance, one Nature, one Immensity, one Principal, one Creator of all things Visible and Invisible, Corporal and Spiri∣tual, who when he pleased, created all things, with his goodness, and would that they should be all very good.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>FUrthermore; That the only begotten Son of God, who is always with the Father, and the Holy Spirit, Consubstantial to the Father, at the time appointed by the profound Wisdom of the Divine Mercy, for the redeeming of Men from the sin of <HI>Adam,</HI> and from all other sins, was truly Incarnate by the operation of the Holy Spirit, in the pure Womb of our Lady the most Blessed Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and in her took our true and intire Nature of Man, that is, a Body and rational Soul, into the Unity of the Divine Per∣son; which Unity was such, that our Lord Jesus Christ is God and Man, and the Son of God, and the Son of Man, in as much as he was the Son of the Blessed Virgin; so that the one Nature is not confounded with the other, neither did the one pass into, nor mix it self with the other; neither did either of them vanish, or cease to be; but in one only Person, or in one Divine Sup∣positum, there are two perfect Natures, a Divine and Humane, but so that the properties of both Natures are still preserved, there being two Wills,
<PB N="123" REF="89"/> the Divine and Humane, and two Operations, Christ still continuing one; for as the Form of God does not destroy the Form of a Servant, so the Form of a Servant does not diminish the Form of God; because he who is true God, is also true Man: God, because <HI>in the beginning he was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word:</HI> Man, because <HI>the Word was made Flesh,</HI> and died among us: God, because by his own Power he satisfied five Thousand Men with five Loaves, and promised the Water of Eternal Life to the <HI>Samaritan</HI> Woman, and raised <HI>Lazarus</HI> from the Grave when he had been dead four days, and gave sight to the Blind, cured the Sick, and commanded the Winds and the Seas: Man, because he suffered Hunger and Thirst, was weary in the Way, was fastned with Nails to the Cross, and died thereon: Equal to the Eternal Father as to the Divinity, and Inferior to the Father as to the Humanity, and Mortal, and Passible.</P>

<PB N="124" REF="90"/> by the whole Catholick Church; for that she really and truly brought forth according to the Flesh, tho' without any Pain or Passion, the true Son of God, made Man; and that the said Son of God Incarnate, truly suffered for us, and was truly dead and buried, and in his Soul truly de∣scended into Hell, or <HI>Limbo,</HI> to redeem the Souls of the Holy Fathers, which were therein, and did truly rise again from the dead the third day, and afterwards for forty days taught his Disciples, speaking with them of the Kingdom of Heaven, and immediately by his own Power ascended into the Heavens, where he sits at the right hand of the Majesty, Glory, and Power of the Father, from whence he shall come to Judge the quick and the dead, and to give to every one according to their Works.</P>

<P>THe Synod being informed that the Chri∣stians of this Diocess, by reason of the Communication they have with Infidels, and by living among them, have imbibed several of their Errors and Ignorances, namely, three that are the common Errors of all the Infidels of these parts; the first is, That there is a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Transmigration.]</HI> This was not the Doctrine of this Church, as appears plainly from what is said in twenty places of this Synod, of her believing, that the Souls of the Just departed this Life, were in a Terrestrial Para∣dise, where they were to remain till the day of Judgment.</NOTE> Transmigrati∣on of Souls, which after Death go either into the Bodies of Beasts, or of some other Men; which besides that it is a great Ignorance, is also an Er∣ror contrary to the Catholick Faith, which teach∣eth, That our Souls after Death are carried to Heaven or Hell, or Purgatory, or <HI>Limbus,</HI> ac∣cording to every ones Merits, and that there is no such fabulous and false Transmigration.</P>
<PB N="138" REF="97"/>
<P>The second is, That all things come necessari∣ly to pass, or through<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am very apt to believe that they are here falsely accused of attributing all things to Fate, for no other reason but because they believed Predestination; which if it was so, Arch-Bishop <HI>Menezes,</HI> who was himself an <HI>Austin</HI> Fryar, shewed but little respect to the Memory of his pretended Father, in making Predestination and Fate to be equally destructive of hu∣mane Liberty.</NOTE> Fate or Fortune, which they call the Nativity of Men, who they say are compelled to be what they are, and that there is no help for it; which is a manifest Error, and condemned by Holy Mother Church, for as much as it destroys that Liberty of Will, with which God created us, leaving us in the power of our own Will, to do Good or Evil, to obey his Holy Inspirations and Internal Motions, by which he excites to Good, or to resist Evil; so that as it de∣pends on his Divine mercy and goodness to move us to Good, so it depends on our Free-Will, whether by his assistance we will obey those In∣spirations, and will profit our selves of his Inter∣nal Motions, or of our own free Will refuse to do it; or in a word, do Well, or Ill; so that if we perish for doing any thing that is Ill, it is the fault of our own Free-Will; as the Catho∣lick Faith teaches us; and not from the fate of our Nativity, as the ignorant Heathens will have it.</P>
<P>The third is,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This is an Error that <HI>Justin Martyr, Clemens Alexandrinus,</HI> and others of the Philosophical Fathers seem to have been in.</NOTE> That every one may be saved in his own Law; all which are Good, and lead Men to Heaven. Now this is a manifest Heresy; there being no other Law upon earth in which Salvation is to be found, besides that of
<PB N="139" REF="97"/> our Saviour Christ, for that he only teacheth the Truth; so that all that live in any other Sect, are out of a state of Salvation, and shall be condemn∣ed to Hell; there being no other Name given to Men, by which we can be saved, but only the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God, who was Crucified for us: All which Er∣rors, the Synod commandeth the Vicars and Preachers often to preach against in the hearing of the ignorant People; and all Confessors to examine their Penitents concerning them, and to teach them the Catholick Truth.</P>

<P>THis Synod being informed, that there is a dangerous Heresy, and very injurious to our Lord Jesus Christ, sown and preached through this Diocess; which is, That it is a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Grievous Sin.]</HI> How does this consist with their having so many Crosses in their Churches, and Houses, as they tell us they had; or with their administring the Sacrament of the Eucharist; or with their Preaching that it was Christ, and not the Son of God, that suffered upon the Cross.</NOTE> grievous sin so much as to think or speak of our Saviour's Holy Passion: and as there are a great many of this Opinion, so the doing of it has formerly been prohibited by impious Censures; all which is a manifest Error, and extreamly prejudicial to the Souls of all faithful Christians; and the fruit and profit of Souls, arising from such Considerations, and Discourses, which is very great, as well for that love and affection which they beget in us, for our Saviour, who suffer'd for our Salvation, as
<PB N="140" REF="98"/> for the Example of those Vertues which were so Illustrious in his Holy Passion, and the hatred of Sin, for which he suffer'd so much, and the fear of the Divine Justice which he so rigorously satis∣fied, and the confidence of our Salvation by such a plenteous Redemption; and the use of the Sacraments, to which he applyed the virtue of his Holy Passion, and other infinite benefits which are derived from thence to our Souls, which Error included another no less prejudicial, and which is also common among the <HI>Nestorians; the condemning of Holy Images;</HI> for that if it were an Impiety to think of the Passion of our Lord Christ, it must follow that all those things are unlawful, that move or contribute thereun∣to; as, the Sign of the Holy Cross; and all Images of the Holy Passion; all which is a gross and manifest Heresy: Wherefore the Synod doth recommend it to all Preachers, Confessors, and Rectors of Churches, frequently to perswade their People to the consideration of those Di∣vine Mysteries; and to that end, they shall ad∣vise them to the Devotion of the <HI>Rosary</HI> of our Lady the most Blessed Virgin <HI>Mary;</HI> wherein are contained all the principal Mysteries of the Life of our Lord Christ, with profitable Medita∣tions upon them.</P>

The Synod doth therefore declare, That it is the Doctrine of the Catholick Faith, that the Holy Virgin was never at any time stained with the guilt of any actual sin; and that it is Pious to believe, that she was also Conceived without Original Sin; it seeming to be most agreeable to the Dignity of the Mother of God, that it should be so; tho' it is true, that Holy Mother Church<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Has not as yet determined]</HI> It is much she has not, since the In∣vention of the Holy Reliques in the Mountains of <HI>Granada,</HI> among which there was a Book in <HI>Arabick</HI> of S. <HI>Cecilius,</HI> who was consecrated Bishop of <HI>Eliberis</HI> by St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> with this Title, <HI>De Dono Gloriae &amp; Dono Tormenti;</HI> in which there is the following Definition of the Immaculate Con∣ception made by all the Apostles, being met together to Solemnize the Exequies of the Blessed Virgin: <HI>Illa Virgo</HI> Maria, <HI>Illa Sancta, Illa electa à primo, Originarioque pec∣cato praeservata fuit, &amp; ab omni cul∣pâ libera; atque haec veritas Apo∣stolorum Concilium est, quam qui ne∣gaverit, maledictus &amp; excommuni∣catus erit, &amp; salutem non conseque∣tur, sed in aeternum damnabitur:</HI> All which Reliques, and this Book among the rest, were after a severe and impartial Examination, ap∣proved of, and received as ge∣nuine, by a late Provincial Synod in <HI>Spain.</HI></NOTE> has not as yet determined any thing about that matter. Furthermore, the Catholick Faith teacheth, that she was always, before, in, and after Child-birth, a most pure Virgin, and that she brought forth the Son of God, made Man, without any Pain, or Passion; having none of those things which are common to other Women after Child-birth, nor no need of any created assistance to help her to bring forth, or afterwards, there being nothing in her but what was pure, the Eternal Word, made Flesh, springing out of her Womb, the Claustrum of her pure Virginity being shut,
<PB N="142" REF="99"/> when the time, determined in the Consistory of the Holy Trinity was come, to the great Spiritual Joy and satisfaction of the said Blessed Virgin; for which reason she ought truly to be stiled the Mother of God, and not only the Mother of Christ; and that when she departed this Life, she was immediately carried up into Heaven, where by a particular privilege due to her Merits, she enjoys God both in Body and Soul, without waiting for the general Resurrection; there be∣ing no reason why that Body, out of which there was most Holy Flesh formed, for the Son of God made Man, should as other Bodies be dissolved into Dust and Ashes, but that it should be im∣mediately exalted and glorified, and placed high above all the Quires of Angels, as Holy Mother Church sings and confesseth; concerning the whole of which matter, the Impious <HI>Nestorian</HI> Hereticks have spoke, and writ, even in the Bre∣viaries used in this Bishoprick, a great many Blasphemies and Heresies.</P>

<P>THe Purity of the Faith being preserved by nothing more than by Books of sound and holy Doctrine; and on the contrary, there being nothing whereby the Minds of People are more corrupted, than by Books of suspicious and He∣retical Doctrines; Errors being by their means easily insinuated into the Hearts of the Ignorant, that read or hear them: Wherefore the Synod knowing that this Bishoprick is full of Books writ in the <HI>Surian</HI> Tongue by <HI>Nestorian</HI> Hereticks, and Persons of other Devilish Sects, which abound with Heresies, Blasphemies and false Doctrines, doth command in virtue of Obedience, and up∣on pain of Excommunication to be <HI>ipso facto</HI> in∣curred, that no Person, of what quality and con∣dition soever, shall from henceforward presume to keep, translate, read or hear read to others, any of the following Books.</P>
<P>The Book intituled, <HI>The Infancy of our Saviour,</HI> Or <HI>The History of our Lady;</HI> condemned former∣ly by the ancient Saints, for being full of Blas∣phemies, Heresies, and fabulous Stories, where among others it is said, that the Annunciation of
<PB N="155" REF="105"/> the Angel was made in the Temple of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> where our Lady was, which contradicts the Go∣spel of St. <HI>Luke,</HI> which saith, it was made in <HI>Na∣zareth;</HI> as also that <HI>Joseph</HI> had actually another Wife and Children, when he was betrothed to the Holy Virgin; and that he often reproved the Child Jesus for his naughty Tricks; that the Child Jesus went to School to the Rabbins, and learnt of them, with a thousand other Fables and Blasphemies of the same Nature, and things un∣worthy of our Lord Christ, whereas the Gospel saith, that the <HI>Jews</HI> were astonished at his Wis∣dom, asking how he came by so much Learning, having never been taught; that the Devil tempt∣ed Christ before his Fast of forty days, which is contrary to the Gospel; that St. <HI>Joseph,</HI> to be sa∣tisfied whether the Virgin had committed Adul∣tery, carried her before the Priests, who accord∣ing to the Law gave her the Water of Jealousie to drink; that our Lady brought forth with pain, and parting from her Company, not being able to go farther, she retired to a Stable at <HI>Bethlehem;</HI> that neither our Lady, nor any other Saint is in Heaven enjoying God, but are all in a Terre∣strial Paradise, where they are to remain till the day of Judgment, with other Errors, too many to be related: But it is the Synod's pleasure to instance in some of the chief Errors contained in the Books that it condemns, that so all may be satisfied of the reason why they are prohibited to be read, or kept upon pain of Excommunica∣tion, and that all may avoid and burn them
<PB N="156" REF="106"/> with the greater Horror, and for other just and necessary respects.</P>
<P>Also the Book of <HI>John Barialdan,</HI> wherein it is said in divers places, That there were two Per∣sons, a Divine and Humane, in Christ, which is contrary to the Catholick Faith, which confes∣ses one only Divine Person: It is also said, That the Names of Christ and <HI>Emanuel</HI> are the Names of the Humane Person only, and for that reason that the most sweet Name <HI>Jesus</HI> is not to be ado∣red; that the Union of the Incarnation is com∣mon to all the Three Divine Persons, who were all Incarnated; that our Lord Christ is the adop∣ted, and not the Natural Son of God; that the Union of the Incarnation is accidental, and is only that of Love betwixt the Divine and Hu∣mane Persons.</P>
<P>Also the Book intituled, <HI>The Procession of the Holy Spirit;</HI> wherein it is endeavoured to be proved at large, that the Holy Spirit proceedeth only from the Father, and not from the Son, which is contrary to the Catholick Truth, which teaches, that he proceeds from the Father and the Son.</P>

<P>Also a Book of the Life of Abbot <HI>Isaias,</HI> com∣mented by a <HI>Nestorian,</HI> wherein it is said, That the Union is common to all the Three Persons; that St. <HI>Cyril</HI> of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> who condemned <HI>Ne∣storius,</HI> was an impious Heretick, and is now in Hell, for having taught, that there is but One Person in Christ; whereas, as often as <HI>Nestori∣us, Theodorus</HI> and <HI>Diodorus</HI> are named, they are stiled Saints, and blessed; by whose Authority it is there proved, that the Saints shall not en∣joy God before the day of Judgment; and that till then they shall be in an obscure place, which they call <HI>Eden,</HI> near to the Terrestrial Paradise; and that by so much the worse as any one has been, he is tormented<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The less for it in Hell.]</HI> This of fixing something that is justly abominable to all Mankind, upon her Adversaries, has been the constant practice of the Church of <HI>Rome:</HI> So the Empe∣ror <HI>Michael Balbus,</HI> because he was an Enemy to Image-worship, is said to have laughed at the Prophets, not to have believed there were any Devils, and to have placed <HI>Judas</HI> among the Saints; the Templars, upon the Pope and the <HI>French</HI> Kings con∣spiring together to destroy their Order, are said to have obliged all their Novices to blaspheme God, to renounce Christ, the Vir∣gin <HI>Mary,</HI> and all the Saints in Hea∣ven, to spit and trample upon the Crucifix, and to declare that Christ was a false Prophet; the <HI>Albigenses</HI> are said to have held it lawful to deny their Faith, when interrogated upon it by a Magistrate, to have held, that pro∣miscuous Venery was lawful, but that Matrimony was Hell and Damnation; that the Souls of Men were as Mortal as their Bo∣dies; that the way of choosing their chief Priests, was by tossing an Infant from one to another, and that he in whose hands the Infant expired, had that Office, and that the Devil was unjustly thrown out of Heaven.</NOTE> the less for it in Hell, by reason of his greater conformity and friendship with the Devils; that the Word was not made
<PB N="159" REF="107"/> Man, and that it is Blasphemy to affirm it; that Christ conquer'd all the Passions of Sin by a Pow∣er derived from God, and not by his own strength; that St. <HI>Cyril</HI> was a Heretick in teach∣ing, that there was but One Person in Christ; that the Divine and Humane Nature were uni∣ted in Christ accidentally by Love; that the whole Trinity was incarnated; that God dwelt in Christ as in a Rational Temple, giving him power to do all the good things he did; that the Souls of the Just will be in a Terrestrial Pa∣radise till the day of Judgment; that the Wick∣ed when they dye in Mortal Sin, are carried to a place called <HI>Eden,</HI> where they suffer only by the sense of the punishments they know they are to undergo after the day of Judgment.</P>
<P>Also the Book of Synods, wherein there is a forged Letter of Pope <HI>Caius,</HI> with false Subscrip∣tions of a great many other Western Bishops, di∣rected to those of <HI>Babylon,</HI> wherein it is acknow∣ledged, that the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> ought to be subject to that of <HI>Babylon,</HI> which with all that are subject to her, are immediately under Christ, without owing any reverence to the <HI>Roman</HI> Bi∣shop; they say likewise, That the <HI>Roman</HI> Church is <HI>fallen from the Faith,</HI> having perverted the Ca∣nons of the Apostles, by the force of Heretical Emperors Arms; and that the <HI>Romans</HI> are He∣reticks, for not <HI>celebrating in leavened Bread,</HI> which has been the inviolable Custom of the Church derived from our Saviour, and his Ho∣ly Apostles; that all the Bishops that followed

<P>Also the Book of <HI>Orders;</HI> wherein it is said, That the Form, and not the Matter, is necessary to Orders; and the Forms therein are likewise Erroneous; that there are only two Orders, <HI>Di∣aconate</HI> and <HI>Priesthood;</HI> that Altars of Wood, and not of Stone, are to be Consecrated; there are also Prayers in it for those that are converted from any other Sect to <HI>Nestorianism,</HI> in form of an Absolution from the Excommunication they had incurred for not having followed <HI>Nestorius,</HI> and of a reconciliation to the Church.</P>
<P>Also the Book of <HI>Homilies;</HI> wherein it is said, That the <HI>Holy Eucharist is only the Image of Christ, and is distinguished from him, as an Image is from a true Man; and that the Body of our Lord Je∣sus Christ is not there, nor no where else but in Heaven:</HI> That the whole Trinity was Incarnate; that Christ is only the Temple of the Divinity, and God only by Representation; that the Soul of Christ descended not into Hell, but was car∣ried to the Paradise of <HI>Eden;</HI> that whosoever affirms the contrary, errs, and that we therefore err in our Creed: There are therein likewise some Letters of some Heretical Synods, in which it is said, That the Patriarch of <HI>Babylon</HI> is not subject to the <HI>Roman</HI> Bishop; with an Oath to

<P>Also a Book intituled, <HI>An Exposition of the Gospels;</HI> wherein it is every where pretended to be proved, That there are two Persons in Christ, and that Christ as a pure Creature, was obliged to adore God, and stood in need of Prayer; that he was the Temple of the most Holy Trinity; that Christ's Soul when he died, descended not into Hell, but was carried to the Paradise of <HI>Eden;</HI> which was the place he pro∣mised to the Thief on the Cross: That our Lady, the Virgin, deserved to be reproved for having vainly imagined, that she was Mother to one that was to be a great King; looking upon Christ as no other than a pure Man; and presuming that he was to have a Temporal Empire, as well as the res<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the <HI>Jews:</HI> That the Evangelists did not Record all Christ's Actions in Truth as they were, they not having been present at se∣veral of them; which was the reason why they differed from one another so much: That the Wise Men that came from the <HI>East,</HI> received no favour from God, for the Journey they took; neither did they believe in Christ; that Christ was the adopted Son of God, it being as im∣possible that he should be Gods Natural Son, as it is that Just Men should be so; that he re∣ceived new Grace in Baptism, which he had not before; that he is only the Image of the Word; and the pure Temple of the Holy Spirit; that
<PB N="163" REF="109"/> the <HI>Holy Eucharist is only the Image of the Body of Christ, which is only in Heaven at the right hand of the Father, and not here on Earth:</HI> That Christ, as pure Man, did not know when the day of Judgment was to be: That when St. <HI>Thomas</HI> put his Hand into Christ's Side, and said, <HI>My Lord, and my God!</HI> he did not speak to Christ; for that he that was raised was not God; but it was only an Exclamation made to God upon his beholding such a Miracle: That the Autho∣rity that Christ gave to St. <HI>Peter</HI> over the Church, was the same that he gave to other Priests; so that his Successors have no more Power or Ju∣risdiction than other Bishops: That our Lady, the Virgin, is not the Mother of God: That the first Epistle of St. <HI>John,</HI> and that of St. <HI>James,</HI> are not the Writings of thole Holy Apostles, but of some other Persons of the same Name, and therefore are not Canonical.</P>

<P>BUt the forementioned Heresies are not only to be met with in these Books, but are like∣wise in the Common Prayer, and Breviaries that they use in their Churches, which having been composed by <HI>Nestorian</HI> Hereticks, are full of Blasphemies, Heresies, Fables, and Apocry∣phal stories, whereby instead of praising God, they are continually blaspheming him in their Divine Offices.</P>
<P>In the Book called the <HI>Great Breviary,</HI> it is said, That the Divine Word did not assume Flesh, ignorantly pretending to prove it thus; because if the Word had assumed Flesh, to what purpose was the Holy Spirit's overshadowing the Virgin? In the same Breviary the whole Office of Ad∣vent is Heretical, it being every where affirmed therein, that Christ had two Persons, and calling
<PB N="168" REF="112"/> him continually only the Temple of God; and in the Feast of the Nativity, there is a proposi∣tion in one of the solemn Antiphona's, that di∣rectly contradicts St. <HI>John,</HI> in which it is said, that <HI>the Word was not made Flesh,</HI> and that all that be∣lieve the contrary, are disobedient to the Church, and are obstinate Rebels against the Faith; so that the whole Offices of the Advent and Nativi∣ty are little else than pure Blasphemy.</P>
<P>In the Book of Prayers for the great Fast, it is frequently said, that there were two Persons, a Divine and Humane in Christ. It contains al∣so several Commemorations of <HI>Nestorius,</HI> and o∣ther Hereticks his Followers, affirming <HI>Marndeay, Theodorus</HI> and <HI>Diodorus,</HI> and other <HI>Nestorian</HI> He∣reticks, to have been the Followers of St. <HI>E∣phrem.</HI></P>
<P>In the Greater Breviary, which they call <HI>Hudre</HI> and <HI>Gaza,</HI> or <HI>The Treasure of Prayers,</HI> it is every where said, that there are two Persons in Christ, and one representation of the Son of God; that he is the Image of the Word, and the Temple of the same; that the Divine Person did enlighten the Humane, and that Christ advanced in Grace and Knowledge by degrees; that our Lady never carried God in her Womb, as Hereticks affirm, Christ being a Man like to others, and that she ought not to be called the Mother of God, but only the Mother of the second <HI>Adam;</HI> that the whole Trinity assumed Humanity, and that St. <HI>Matthew</HI> taught the <HI>Hebrews</HI> so; that God did not make himself Flesh, which he only took as
<PB N="169" REF="112"/> a Dwelling to cover his Glory; that God ac∣companyed Christ on the Cross, but had not ta∣ken the Humanity, neither was it God that suf∣fered; that the Word of the Father changed it self into Humanity, and by the Son of <HI>Mary</HI> re∣deemed Mankind; that the Father Eternal took Flesh in the same manner as the Son; that the Angel delivered his Message to the Virgin in the Temple, and not at <HI>Nazareth;</HI> that the pains of travail opened the Womb of the Virgin, who brought forth with labour after the manner of other Women; that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>In the most holy Sacra∣ment.]</HI> The Christians who live scattered about <HI>Mesopotamia</HI> and <HI>Assyria,</HI> and whose Patriarch re∣sides at the Monastery of St. <HI>Raban Hurnez</HI> the <HI>Persian,</HI> in the <HI>Gordyae∣an</HI> Mountains, 40 miles above <HI>Ni∣niveh,</HI> tho' <HI>Eutychians,</HI> and for that reason Enemies to the <HI>Chal∣dean</HI> Christians, do agree with them in denying Transubstantia∣tion, as appears from the follow∣ing Prayer taken out of their Missal, and communicated to me by my Learned Friend Dr. <HI>Hide. Angeli &amp; homines laudabunt te, O Christe, Sacrificere pro nobis, qui per Sacramenta, quae sunt in Eccle∣sia tua, docuisti nos, secundum magni∣ficentiam tuam, quod sicut in Pane, &amp; Vino Natura sunt à te distincta, in Virtute &amp; potentia idem sunt te∣cum.

<P>Now I take this Testimony a∣gainst Transubstantiation to be much the stronger for it's being given by the <HI>Eutychians,</HI> to whose Heresie Transubstantiation, had it been believed, would have given great Countenance; as indeed I cannot but reckon those Hereticks having no where made use of that Doctrine to support their Heresie, to be a considerable Argument of its not having been believed ei∣ther by themselves, or by the Or∣thodox; for had the latter belie∣ved it, tho' they had not done it themselves, they could not have failed to have used it as <HI>Argumen∣tum ad hominem,</HI> which is what they have no where done. It is true, this is only a Negative Ar∣gument, but it is as true, that it is so circumstantiated as to be of e∣qual force with one that is posi∣tive. So again, I do not see how we could have had a clearer proof of Transubstantiation, not having been believed either by the <HI>Mani∣chees,</HI> or the Orthodox, than we have from the <HI>Manichees</HI> abstain∣ing from the Cup in the Sacrament for no other reason, but because they did not think it lawful to drink Wine, and from the Ortho∣doxes proving against them from that very Institution that it was lawful, and endeavouring to con∣vince them by several Arguments, that it was their Duty to receive the Cup in the Sacrament; and all this without ever so much as once intimating, that the Liquor in the Cup, when it came to be re∣ceived, was Blood and not Wine.</P></NOTE> <HI>in the most Holy Sacra∣ment of the Eucharist, there is not the true Body of Christ;</HI> with a thousand more Blasphemies about

This is a long time for an Apostolical Traditi∣on to run under ground; and which is yet more wonderful, that it should break out in an Age that knew nothing of Ec∣clesiastical Antiquity, or indeed of any other sort of Learning; but this was the common fate of all the <HI>Roman</HI> Doctrines and Rites, which they pretend to have re∣ceived from the Apostles, only by the way of the dark and un∣certain conveyance of Oral Tra∣dition.</NOTE> Seven, to wit, <HI>Baptism, Confirmation,</HI> the <HI>Eucharist, Penitence, Extream Ʋnction, Or∣der,</HI>
<PB N="183" REF="119"/> and <HI>Matrimony:</HI> All which do differ much from the Sacraments of the Old Law, which did not cause, but did only signifie the Grace that was to be given by the Passion of Christ, where∣as our Sacraments do contain Grace, and give it to all those that receive them worthily; the first <HI>five</HI> were ordained for the Spiritual perfe∣cting of every Man only with relation to him∣self, the <HI>two last</HI> were appointed for the good Government and encrease of the Church; by <HI>Baptism</HI> we are spiritually born again to God; by <HI>Confirmation</HI> we are advanced in Grace, for∣tified in the Faith, and being Regenerated and strengthened, we are supported by the Divine Food of the <HI>Eucharist,</HI> and Sacrament of the Al∣tar; and when we chance by Sin to fall into any di∣stemper of Soul, we are Spiritually restored by <HI>Penitence,</HI> and both Spiritually and Corporally by <HI>Extream Ʋnction;</HI> by the Sacrament of <HI>Or∣der,</HI> the Church is governed, and Spiritually multiplied, and by <HI>Matrimony</HI> Corporally: All these Sacraments are perfected by three Causes; that is, Things as their matter, Words as their form, and the Person that is to administer them with an<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Intention.]</HI> This Doctrine after all their talk of the necessity there is of an infallible certainty in all matters of Religion, must make them to be very far from having any such certainty of their being Christians, or of their ha∣ving either a Priest, or a Bishop in their Church. For as they cannot be infallibly certain of any Bishop or Priest's Intention in the Administration of the Sacraments, so they may be certain that it is possible that Bishops and Priests may be so wicked as not to intend what the Church does in such administration, nay, to intend the contrary; for there was a Parish-Priest burnt not many Years ago at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> who confes∣sed at his Death, that whenever he baptized, or consecrated, he had a formed Intention not to administer those Sacraments.</NOTE> Intention of doing what the Church
<PB N="184" REF="120"/> doth; and where any of these three Causes are wanting, they are not perfect, neither indeed is any Sacrament administer'd; all the Ceremonies and Rites, approved and made use of by Holy Mother Church, in the administration of the Sa∣craments are holy, and cannot be despised, neg∣lected, or<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Changed.]</HI> This is very strange, considering that most of those Rites are but new even in the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, that of the Elevation of the Host not excep∣ted: Of the Elevation of the Host, Cardinal <HI>Bona</HI> in the 13th. Chap. of his 2d.

<P>As to Peoples being present at Mass, that did not communicate at the same time, the same Car∣dinal saith in the 14th. Chap. of his first Book, <HI>Primi &amp; Secundi post Christum saeculi foelicitas haec fuit, cum multitudo credentium, quorum &amp; erat Cor unum, &amp; animae una, ardentissimo Dei amore succen∣sa, nihil impensius desiderabat, quàm ad hoc supercoeleste convivi∣um accedere, in quo anima de Deo saginatur, ut loquitur Tertullianus; at propè finem Tertii coepit fervor ille languescere, &amp; numerus commu∣nicantium imminui, quam tepidita∣tem aegrè ferentes Patres Concilii Illiberitani, Cap.</HI> 28. <HI>Statuerunt, Episcopum non debere munera ab eo accipere qui non communicat.

Chap. of his second Book, saith; <HI>Sacra Com∣munio antiquo ritu, non ore excipi so∣lebat, ut hodiè fit, sed manu, quam qui susceperat, Ori reverenter admo∣vebat.</HI> As to the Priest's speak∣ing the words of Consecration so low that no body can hear him, in his 12th. Chap. of the same Book, he saith; <HI>Graeci &amp; alii Orientales verba consecrationis ela∣tâ voce pronunciant, &amp; populus re∣spondet, Amen. Eundem morem ser∣vabat olim Ecclesia Occidentalis, omnes enim audiebant verba conse∣crationis; postea statutum est, ut Canon submissa voce recitaretur; &amp; sic desiit ea consuetudo, seculo deci∣mo, ut conjicio.</HI></P>
<P>As to the usage of her denying the Cup to the People, in the 18th. Chap. of his second Book, he saith, <HI>Semper enim &amp; ubique ab Ecclesiae primordiis us{que} ad saeculum duodecimum, sub specie panis &amp; Vini in Ecclesiis communicârunt fideles; coepit{que} paulatim ejus saeculi initio usus calicis obsolescere, pleris{que} Epis∣copis eum populo interdicentibus, &amp; sic paulatim introducta est Commu∣nio sub solâ specie panis; quod à nul∣lo negari potest, qui vel levissimâ rerum Ecclesiasticarum notitiâ imbu∣tus est.</HI></P>
<P>And as to her making use of Un∣leavened Bread, in the 23d. Chap. of his first Book, he saith; <HI>Quod si Veteres Patres, percurrere &amp; om∣nem evolvere antiquitatem libeat, inveniemus proculdubio sic à tem∣pore Apostolorum, &amp; de inceps de pane Eucharistico, omnes loqui, ut non nisi de communi, &amp; fermentato commodè intelligi, &amp; explicari que∣ant.</HI></P>
<P>As to her giving the Sacrament in Wafers, in the 23d. Chap. of the same Book, he saith; <HI>Vivente Humberto qui floruit Anno</HI> 1245. <HI>panis consecrandus in Eucharistiâ tan∣tae magnitudinis erat, ut ex eo con∣secratae tot particulae frangi possent quot erant necessariae ad populum com∣municandum, &amp; panis qui tradeba∣tur talis fuit, ut deglutiri non posset, nisi dentibus comminutus.</HI></P>
<P>And as to her keeping the consecrated Bread, or Hosts as she calls them, after the Commu∣nion is over, he saith in the same Book; <HI>Ne reliquiae Sacramenti su∣peressent, saepe decretum est, ut tot particulae consecrarentur, quot erant parati ad communionem; &amp; si quid residuum foret, à sacerdete, seu Mi∣nistris commederetur; quod si conti∣gerit ut Ministrorum incuria putre∣scerent, statuit Concilium Arelatense apud Joan.

These Sacraments were all instituted by our Lord Je∣sus Christ before his Ascention into Heaven, that so by their means he might communicate Grace, and other Spiritual Benefits, he had merited for us by his Death on the Cross, confirming them to the faithful by his Word and Promises, that so by using them lawfully, and with due dispo∣sitions, we might be ascertained of his commu∣nicating

<P>THe first of all the Sacraments is that of <HI>Bap∣tism,</HI> which is the Gate of the Spiritual Life, and that whereby we are made capable of the other Sacraments, of which without it we are no ways capable; for as a Man must first be born, before he can enjoy the good things of the Na∣tural Life, so Men before they are born again in Baptism, are not capable of enjoying the hea∣venly advantages of a Spiritual Life, it being by Baptism that we are made Members of Christ, and are incorporated into the Christian Com∣mon-wealth, and the Mystical Body of the Church; for as by the first man Death came up∣on all, for the Sin of Disobedience committed by him and us, for which Sin we were exclu∣ded the Kingdom of Heaven, and were born Children of Wrath, and separated from God, so that without being born again of Water and the Spirit, we cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, as Christ himself has taught us; so that as we were born Children of Wrath, by Baptism we return to be Children of Grace, and as we were born in sin the Sons of Men, in Baptism we are born the Sons of God; all that are bap∣tized

<HEAD>The Doctrine of the Sacrament of Confirmation.</HEAD>
<P>THe Second Sacrament is <HI>Confirmation,</HI> which our Lord Christ instituted, in order to the confirming and establishing of Christians in the Faith, so that nothing might be able to se∣parate them from it through the Power of the
<PB N="210" REF="133"/> Holy Ghost which is given therein, particularly to that effect; besides the sanctifying Grace which it gives in common with the other Divine Sa∣craments; the Matter of this Sacrament is the Holy Oyl of Chrism, made of the Oyl of the Olive-tree, signifying the light and purity of the Conscience; and of Balsam, which signifies the sweet smell of a good Name, both mixed together, and blessed by the hand of the Bishop; the Form are the words spoke by the Bishop when he dips his Thumb into the said Chrism, making therewith the Sign of the Cross on the Forehead of the Person that is confirmed, saying, <HI>I sign thee with the sign of the Cross, and do con∣firm thee with the Chrism of Health, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;</HI> to which the Bishop subjoyns three holy and wholsome Prayers, wherein he beseeches God to fill those that are confirmed with his Divine Spi∣rit. The ordinary Minister of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The <HI>English</HI> Jesuits, who could not endure that the Pope should put a Bishop over them here in <HI>England,</HI> in their Books wherein they laboured to prove that there was no need of one, spoke very slightingly of Confir∣mation; affirming it to be a Sacra∣ment that was not enjoyned but only where it might be had very easily; that the effects thereof might be abundantly supplyed by the other Sacraments, nay by or∣dinary Assistances, that the Chrism in Baptism had not only the signi∣fication, but all the effects of Con∣firmation, so far at least as to make it not to be very necessa∣ry. In a word, that Confirmati∣on was not simply necessary, nei∣ther <HI>Necessitate Medii,</HI> nor <HI>Neces∣sitate Praecepti;</HI> so that it was not likely, that the want of it in <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣land</HI> was the cause of so many Peoples apostatizing from the Ca∣tholick Faith: So little do either the Sacraments, or the Hierarchy, not excepting the Papacy it self, signifie, when they stand in the way of the Jesuits ambition.</P>
<P>I do not except the Papacy, because when it was generally be∣lieved that <HI>Clement</HI> the VIIIth. was resolved to condemn <HI>Molina</HI>'s Book of <HI>Scientia Media,</HI> the <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> Jesuits endeavoured to ward off that blow, by affirming in their publick Conclusions in their College at <HI>Complutum,</HI> that it was not a matter of Faith, to believe that <HI>Clement</HI> the VIIIth. was true Pope; for which <HI>Luisius Turrianus</HI> the President of the Disputation, the Rector of the College, and <HI>Vasquez,</HI> who were present at the Act, were all summoned to appear before the Inquisition of <HI>Toledo,</HI> as <HI>Gaspar Hortadus, Grego∣ry de la Camara,</HI> and <HI>Alvarez de Villegas,</HI> were to appear at <HI>Rome</HI> before the Pope, for having de∣fended the same Conclusion pub∣lickly in the said University much about the same time; so that had <HI>Clement</HI> the VIIIth. condemned <HI>Mo∣lina</HI>'s Book after the whole order of the Jesuits had espoused the me∣rits thereof so publickly, which the <HI>Dominicans</HI> say he would cer∣tainly have done, had he but li∣ved a few Months longer, <HI>Ignati∣us Loyola</HI> appearing to some Jesu∣its in <HI>Spain,</HI> and assuring them that <HI>Molina</HI>'s Book would never be condemned by any Pope notwith∣standing; we should have had Simony, or some other Nullity found in his Election by the Jesu∣its before this time: By this we see that Jesuits have wherewith to intimidate Popes, as well as Princes and Bishops.</P></NOTE> Confirmation is the Bishop, for tho' simple Priests may perform se∣veral other Unctions, this can be done only by
<PB N="211" REF="133"/> a Bishop, the Bishops being the Successors of the Apostles, by the imposition of whose hands the Holy Ghost was given; in the place of which imposition of hands the Church gives Confirma∣tion, Christ having so ordained it, wherein the Holy Ghost is given likewise; Nevertheless, by a dispensation from the Holy See, and by no o∣ther way, when there is any very urgent Occa∣sion, or when it happens to be necessary for the good of the Faithful, simple Priests may confirm with Chrism, that has been consecrated by a Bishop in the forementioned Form; the effect of this Sacrament is, that there∣in the Holy Ghost is given, to the strengthening
<PB N="212" REF="134"/> and fortifying of the Soul, as it was given to the Apostles on the day of <HI>Pentecost,</HI> that Christi∣ans may with boldness confess the Name of Christ and his Catholick Faith, for which rea∣son the Person confirmed is anointed on the forehead with the Sign of the Cross, that being the most open place of the Body, and the Seat of Shame and Confusion, which is very diffe∣rent from what is done to People when they are baptized, who are anointed on the Head; Peo∣ple are confirmed on the forehead, that they may not be ashamed to confess the Name of Je∣sus Christ and his Cross, which as the Apostle saith, is <HI>to the Jews an Offence, and to the Heathens foolishness;</HI> this Sacrament differs much from that of Baptism, for as by Baptism we are born into the Faith, so by this we are confirmed therein; for as in the Natural Life, to be born is different from growing, so in the Spiritual Life it is one thing to be born to Grace and Faith, which is done in Baptism, and another to encrease and grow stronger therein, which is done in Confirmation, and so in Baptism we are born to a Spiritual Life, and are afterwards prepared and confirmed for our Warfare, and do receive so much strength, that no dangers or terrors of Punishments, or Losses, or Torments, or Deaths are able to sepa∣rate us from the Confession of the Name of Christ, and of the true Faith we profess.</P>

<PB N="218" REF="137"/> which mixture is therefore made, because from the Testimony of Holy Fathers, Holy Mother Church believes that our Lord Christ himself did so, whose having mixed Water with the Wine that he Consecrated, makes it a great Sin to omit to do it. It is also agreeable to the representation of the Mystery of what passed on the Cross, and of our Lord Christ, out of whose precious Side flowed <HI>Water</HI> and <HI>Blood;</HI> as also to signifie the Effect of this Sa∣crament, which is the <HI>Ʋnion</HI> of the Faithful with Christ, the <HI>Water</HI> signifying the Faithful, and the <HI>Wine</HI> our Lord Christ, and the conversion of the <HI>Water</HI> into the <HI>Wine,</HI> the Union of our Souls with Christ by means of this Divine Sacrament, according to what our Lord said; <HI>He that eateth my Flesh and drinketh my Blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</HI> The <HI>Form</HI> of this Sacrament is the words of our Saviour, by which the Sacra∣ment is made; for tho' the Priest pronounceth many and divers words in the <HI>Mass,</HI> and makes many Prayers and Petitions to God, yet when he comes to Consecrate, he useth only the words of Christ, none others belonging to the sub∣stance of Consecration; so the Priest speaking in the Person of Christ, makes this Divine Sacra∣ment, because by virtue of those words, he tur∣neth the substance of <HI>Bread</HI> into the substance of the Body of Christ, and the whole substance of the <HI>Wine</HI> into his <HI>Blood,</HI> there remaining nothing of <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI> after that, but only the Ac∣cidents or Species of them; and that after such
<PB N="219" REF="137"/> a manner, that the whole of Christ's Body and Soul, and Divinity, are contained under every Particle of both, tho' never so small when separated; so that in every crumb of the <HI>Host,</HI> tho' never so small, there is Christ intire, and in every drop of the Species of Wine that is separated there is Christ entire, so that in each of the Species whole Christ, God and Man is re∣ceived, as also the true Sacrament; for which reason Holy Mother Church does not use to Communicate the Faithful but<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vnder one Species.]</HI> What makes the Sacrilege of de∣nying the Cup to the People in the Sacrament to be something the greater, is, that most of the <HI>Roman</HI> Doctors do hold, that there is more Grace convey'd to People by communicating under both the Species of Bread and Wine, than under that of Bread only, <HI>Vasquez Cap.</HI> 2. <HI>Quaest.</HI> 80. <HI>Art.</HI> 12. <HI>Disp.</HI> 215. Nay, Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the VIth, in his Bull to the King of <HI>England</HI> in the Year 1341, acknowledgeth as much, wherein he tells that King, that he granted him the privilege of communicating un∣der both kinds, that he might re∣ceive the more Grace by receiving the Sacrament so.</NOTE> under one Spe∣cies, because in that they receive Christ entire. To this Divine Sacrament the Worship, Venera∣tion and<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Adoration.]</HI> The Primitive Christians must have been People of a strange confidence in tri∣umphing as they did over the stupidity of the Heathen Worship, for being directed to Objects that were subject to all the Accidents and Casualties, that any other Bo∣dies are subject to, had they them∣selves at the same time Worshiped the Host, which is subject to more Accidents than the Stone, Wood, or Brass of the Heathen Images; for they that do Worship it can∣not deny, but that the Host may be Stole, Burnt, eat by Mice, or other Vermine, and if kep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> too long, will of it self Mould and Corrupt. They must certainly have the privilege of believing what they have a mind to, that can believe, That if the Pri∣mitive Christians had had any such Doctrine as this of <HI>Transubstantia∣tion</HI> among them, considering how many, especially in times of Per∣secution, apostatized from the Faith, that it was possible for them to have concealed it from <HI>Celsus, Lucian, Porphyry,</HI> and above all, from <HI>Julian</HI> the Apostate; or that those Heathens, if they had but had the least inkling thereof, would not have made the World to have rung with the noise of it; wherefore their having never mentioned any such thing, consi∣dering the Wit and Spite of the Men, is a demonstration, that there could be no such Doctrine among Christians in their days; neither can <HI>Schelstrat's Doctrina Arcani,</HI> considering the great num∣bers, quality, and temper of Re∣negado's, do any service in this case.</NOTE> Adoration of <HI>Latria</HI> is due, or the

The Effect that this Sacrament worketh on the Souls of those that receive it worthily, is the <HI>Ʋnion</HI> of the Man with Christ, and by it, through Grace, the Man is incorporated into Christ, and joyned to his Members: Moreover by this Sacrament, Grace is increased in all such as receive it worthily, so that whatever effects Carnal eating and drinking works upon a Man as to his Corporal Life, the same are wrought upon Man by this Divine Sa∣crament as to a Spiritual Life.</P>

Nevertheless the Synod gives Licence to such Vicars as know their Parishes to be of that Nature, that it is not possible for the People to comply with this Obligation in so short a time, to wait 'till <HI>Whitsuntide,</HI> and then to declare them; provided that before they declare those that live on the Heaths, they shall first take care to admonish them, either by themselves, or by others of known fidelity, that so they may do their Duty herein, letting them know if they fail, that they must be declared Excommunicate. The Curates must also be sure to observe who have complyed with this Obligation, putting their Names in a Roll as is ordered in Confessi∣on.
<PB N="223" REF="139"/> But notwithstanding the Sacred Canons do oblige the Faithful only to confess and commu∣nicate once a Year at the time aforesaid, never∣theless the Vicars shall advise their Parishioners to do it oftner, namely at <HI>Christmass</HI> and <HI>Whit∣suntide,</HI> and the <HI>Assumption of our Lady,</HI> giving warning thereof still the <HI>Sunday</HI> before.</P>

<P>THe Synod doth declare and teach, That no Christian, how contrite soever for his Sins, may lawfully come to receive the Divine Sacra∣ment of the <HI>Altar,</HI> being guilty of any Mortal Sin, without having first confessed all his Sins entirely, to some approved Priest that has Au∣thority to receive his Confession, that being the Tryal and Examination that the Apostle speaks of, and saith a Man ought to make of himself, and being so approved and confessed, let him eat of the Divine Bread, and drink of the Di∣vine Cup; <HI>For he that eateth and drinketh unwor∣thily,</HI> and with a Conscience of Sin, <HI>eateth and drinketh Judgment</HI> and Condemnation <HI>to himself;</HI> for which reason this Divine Sacrament must not be given to publick Sinners, without they have left their Sins, as publick Witches, and common Women, and such as keep Concubines publick∣ly, and such as are in open malice, before they are reconciled, and all other open Sinners what∣soever. In which Matter the Vicars must be ex∣treamly careful, being sensible, that as it is a grie∣vous
<PB N="224" REF="140"/> Sin in such to receive the Divine Sacrament, before they have forsaken their Sins; so it is like∣wise a grievous offence in them to give the Sa∣crament to such publick Sinners, and who are known by all to live in such Sins, and not to have forsaken them, notwithstanding they should have been confessed by others, and should bring a Note of their being absolved. This matter ought to be laid home to the Consciences of the Vicars by reason of the great dissoluteness that there is in this Bishoprick in giving the Commu∣nion to publick Sinners, and especially to those that keep Concubines, and are Married, but will not live with their Wives, and to others who live in open Malice, without any Body to hinder them, of all which the Vicars must give a strict Account to God; but at the point of death they may give the Divine Sacrament even to such as have been publick Sinners, if they are not finally impenitent.</P>

<P>CHristians are not only bound to receive the most Holy Sacrament of the <HI>Altar</HI> once a Year, at <HI>Easter,</HI> but as often as they are in pro∣bable danger of Death, and especially in any great Sickness, for which reason this Divine Sacrament is called the <HI>Viaticum,</HI> that is to say, the Support in the way from a Mortal to an Eternal Life, wherefore the Synod doth com∣mand all Sick People, whose Distempers are any thing dangerous, to receive it with much De∣votion; and as they that look after the Sick ought to give the Vicars timely Notice, so the Vicars themselves must be diligent to enquire what Persons are sick in their Parishes, that so before they come to be too weak, at a time when it will do them no prejudice, they may be brought in a Palanquin, or in something else that
<PB N="226" REF="141"/> covers them, to the Church, there to receive the Holy Sacrament; for which use there shall be a <HI>Palanquin,</HI> or Net, made commodious with Car∣pets, in every Church, in which the Sick shall be carried with due care, which shall be bought within a month after the publication hereof out of the Fabrick money of the Church, all which the Synod doth recommend earnestly to the Vi∣cars, this being truly the chief Duty of their Of∣fice; and if it shall any time happen that a Pari∣shioner shall die without having received the Communion, thro' the Vicars default, the said Vicar shall be suspended for six months, from his Office and Benefice, and if it happen thorow the Vicars not having been advised thereof, then those that attended the Sick Person, shall be se∣verely punished by the Prelate.</P>

<HEAD>The Doctrine of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass.</HEAD>
<P>THe great Love of God to Mankind, does not only appear in the Institution of the Holy Sacrament of the <HI>Eucharist,</HI> and in the putting of his Divine Body and Blood under the Sacramental <HI>Species,</HI> to be the heavenly Food of our Souls, by which the Spiritual Life is main∣tained and preserved, but in his having likewise so instituted it, that the <HI>Catholick Church Mili∣tant</HI>
<PB N="229" REF="142"/> might have a perpetual and visible Sacrifice for the purging away of our sins, and for turn∣ing the Wrath of our Heavenly Father, who is many times offended with our wickedness into Mercy, and the rigour of his just punishment in∣to Clemency: So in the <HI>Mass</HI> there is offered unto God a true and proper Sacrifice, for the pardon both of the Living and of the Dead, by the offering of the which Sacrifice the Lord is so far appealed as to give Grace, and the Gift of Repentance to Sinners, and by means thereof does forgive Men their Sins and Offences, tho' never so enormous; the <HI>Host</HI> that is offered by the Ministry of the Priest on the Altar of the Church, being one and the same that was offered for us on the Cross, with no other difference be∣sides that of the reason of their being offered: And so it is not only offered for the Sins, Punish∣ments, Satisfactions, and other Necessities of the Faithful that are Living, but also for the Dead, departed in Christ, and that are in the Torments of <HI>Purgatory,</HI> being not as yet fully purged by rea∣son of their not having made a compleat satisfaction for the punishments due to their sins, it being but just and reasonable, that all should be benefited by a Sacrifice, which was instituted for the Remedy and Health of all Mankind; which Oblation is of that purity, that no indignity or wickedness in the <HI>Offerers</HI> is able to defile it: so that as to the substance, value, and acceptation, it is the same when offered by a wicked and unclean sinner, as when by a pure and holy Priest, because it
<PB N="230" REF="143"/> does not derive its Dignity from the <HI>Offerer,</HI> but from the Majesty and excellency of what is offer∣ed, neither does the Eternal Father accept there∣of for the Merits and Vertue of the Priest that offers it, but for the value of the Sacrifice it self, and the infinite Merits of <HI>Christ,</HI> who is offered therein; so that our Saviour being about to offer himself to God the Father on the Altar of the Cross, could not possibly have given us a greater expression of his immense Love for us, than by leaving us this visible Sacrifice in his Church, in which the Blood which was present∣ly to be once offered upon the Altar of the Cross, was to be renewed every day upon the Altar of the Church, and the Memory thereof to our great profit, was to be adored every where in the Church until the end of the World; which Divine Sacrifice is offered to God only, not∣withstanding it is sometimes celebrated in Me∣mory and Honour of the <HI>Martyrs,</HI> and other <HI>Saints</HI> in Bliss; it not being offered to them but to God only, who has been pleased to Crown them with Immortal Honour, rendring him there∣by our bounden thanks for the notable Victory of the <HI>Martyrs,</HI> and the publick Mercies and Blessings he has vouchsafed to other <HI>Saints,</HI> and for the Victories which by these means they ob∣tained over the World, the Flesh, and the De∣vil; beseeching the said Saints to be pleased to intercede for us in Heaven, whose Memories we celebrate on Earth: and tho' the Divine <HI>Eucha∣rist</HI> does still continue to be a Sacrament, yet it is never a Sacrifice, but as it is offered in the <HI>Mass.</HI></P>

The words <HI>in saecula saeculorum</HI> shall be therefore left out, and instead thereof shall be put <HI>usque ad consummationem saeculi,</HI> say∣ing, <HI>hoc erit nobis pignus usque ad consummationem, saeculi,</HI> the Sacrament being a pledge only for so long as we do not see the Glory that we hope for, but is and ever will be such a pledge in this life, Christ having promised to his Church, <HI>that he will be with her to the end of the World;</HI>
<PB N="235" REF="145"/> so that the Divine Sacraments, which were in∣stituted for our benefit, can never fail till then; after these words the Priest shall go on with what immediately follows in the <HI>Mass, Gloria tibi, Domine, gloria tibi,</HI> and so on.</P>
<P>Furthermore in the Consecration of the <HI>Cup</HI> there is added to the words of Christ, <HI>novi testa∣menti qui pro vobis,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>novi &amp; aeterni testamenti mysterium fidei, qui pro vobis &amp; pro multis,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>Furthermore, where the Priest saith <HI>Dominus Deus noster quando spirabit in nobis odor suavissi∣mus,</HI> it is said in the same Prayer, <HI>&amp; cum animae nostrae veritatis tuae scientiâ fuerint illustratae, tunc occurremus dilecto filio tuo,</HI> &amp;c. speaking of the day of Judgment, it shall be said, <HI>Cum corporae nostra veritatis tuae splendore fuerint illustrata, tunc occurremus dilecto filio tuo,</HI> the Souls of the Just being illuminated and glorified in Heaven before the day of Judgment, which is the time when the Bodies receive their Glory; this Passage seeming to allude to the <HI>Nestorian</HI> Heresie, which teacheth that the Souls of the Just do not see God, nor are Glorified, nor are in Bliss, before the day of Judgment.</P>

<P>Furthermore, where the Deacon saith, <HI>Orando pro sanctis patribus nostris Patriarchâ nostro pastore universalis totius Ecclesiae Catholicae,</HI> meaning the Schismatick of <HI>Babylon, &amp; Episcopo hujus Metro∣polis;</HI> it shall be said <HI>Pro sanctis Patribus nostris, beatissimo Papâ nostro totius Ecclesiae Catholicae pastore,</HI> naming him by his Name, <HI>&amp; Episcopo hujus Me∣tropolis,</HI> naming him also, <HI>&amp; Ministris ipsorum;</HI> and a little lower where the Deacon praying, saith, <HI>praecipuè nos oportet orare pro incolumitate Patrum nostrorum sanctorum, domini Patriarchae totius Ec∣clesiae Catholicae pastoris,</HI> naming the <HI>Patriarch</HI> of <HI>Babylon</HI> by Name, instead thereof he shall say, <HI>Praecipuè oportet nos orare pro incolumitate patrum nostrorum Domini Papae,</HI> naming him also, <HI>&amp; Episcopi hujus Metropolis,</HI> naming him also.</P>

<P>Furthermore, when the Deacon a little low∣er saith, <HI>Commemoramus quoque Patres nostros sanctos &amp; veritatis Doctores Dominum &amp; Sanctum Nestorium,</HI> &amp;c. all which is Heretical, it being an impious thing sacrilegiously to pray to God to preserve the Doctrine of <HI>Nestorius,</HI> and of o∣ther Hereticks his followers in the Church, all the forementioned having been such except St. <HI>Ephraim;</HI> wherefore instead of them he shall say,

<P>Furthermore, in the beginning of the Prayer wherein the Deacon saith, <HI>Oportet nos orare &amp; exaltare unum Deum Patrem Dominum omnium adoratione dignissimum, qui per Christum fecit no∣bis bonam spem,</HI> it shall be said, <HI>Qui per Jesum Christum filium suum Dominum nostrum fecit nobis bonam spem.</HI></P>

And where the Priest raising his Voice saith, <HI>Gloria Patri,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Fiat Commemoratio Virginis Mariae Matris Christi,</HI> he shall say, <HI>Fiat commemoratio Virginis Marie Matris ipsius Dei &amp; Domini nostri Jesu Christi;</HI> And a little lower, where the Deacon saith, <HI>In saecula usque in saecula, Amen, Amen, Apostoli ipsius filii &amp; amici unigenti;</HI> he shall say, <HI>Apostoli ipsius filii Dei &amp; amici.</HI> And where the Priest begins, <HI>Pusilli cum majoribus,</HI> and saith, <HI>Resur∣rectione tuâ supergloriosâ resuscitabis eos ad gloriam tuam,</HI> he shall say, <HI>Per Resurrectionem tuam super∣gloriosam suscitabis eos.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore, where the Deacon saith, <HI>Ef∣fundite coram illo corda vestra, jejunio, oratione, &amp; poenitentia, placaverunt Christum, Patrem quoque &amp; Spiritum ejus sanctum,</HI> where in saying, <HI>Spiri∣tum sanctum ejus,</HI> they seem to allude to the Error of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> that the Holy Spirit proceedeth only from the Father, and not from the Father and the Son, as from one principal, as the Catholick Faith confesseth, and because the <HI>Nestorians</HI> by rea∣son of the great Communication they have had with the <HI>Greeks,</HI> have imbibed some of their Er∣rors,
<PB N="239" REF="147"/> that there may be therefore no countenance given to such an Error, it shall be reformed thus, <HI>Placaverunt Patrem Filium, &amp; Spiritum Sanctum.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore, In the Prayer where the Priest saith, <HI>Dominus Deus fortis, tua est Ecclesia san∣cta Catholica, quae admirabili Christi tui passione empta est;</HI> it shall be said, <HI>Quae admirabili Christi filii tui,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Furthermore, near the end of the Gospel ta∣ken out of that Chapter of St. <HI>John,</HI> which, as has been observed, is corrupted in the <HI>Syrian</HI> Translation, where it is read <HI>quoniam venit hora in quâ omnes qui in monumentis sunt audient vocem ipsius,</HI> it shall be read <HI>audient vocem filii Dei,</HI> as it is in the Gospel.</P>
<P>Furthermore, in the <HI>Creed</HI> that is sung in the <HI>Mass</HI> there are wanting several substantial words, where speaking of our <HI>Lord Christ,</HI> and saying that <HI>he was born of the Father before all Worlds,</HI> there is wanting <HI>God of God, light of light, very God of very God,</HI> all which shall be added to it: as also the word <HI>consubstantial to the Father,</HI> lea∣ving out the words that are in its place, in the <HI>Syrian, filius essentiae Patris,</HI> and the whole shall be reformed and translated into the same words, as it is sung in the Catholick Church in the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Missal.</P>

<PB N="241" REF="148"/> Christi,</HI> it shall be said <HI>Per gratiam Dei, &amp; Domini nostri Jesu Christi.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore where the Priest begins <HI>Confite∣mur &amp; laudamus, Domine Deus noster,</HI> where he saith below <HI>Dignos nos fecisti dispensatione sacra∣mentorum sanctorum corporis &amp; sanguinis Christi tui,</HI> it shall be said <HI>Christi filii tui;</HI> as also before where the Priest speaketh to those on the right side of the Altar, and they answer with the Dea∣con <HI>Christus exaudiat orationes tuas, hoc sacrificium quod tu offers pro te, pro nobis, &amp; pro toto orbe à minimo usque ad maximum,</HI> the last words <HI>&amp; pro toto orbe à minimo usque ad maximum,</HI> must be left out, for the <HI>Mass</HI> being a publick Prayer of the Church, <HI>Infidels, Schismaticks</HI> and <HI>Hereticks</HI> are not to be prayed for therein, but only <HI>Catholicks,</HI> and such as are united to the Church; wherefore instead thereof it shall be said, <HI>quod tu offers pro te, pro nobis, &amp; pro universâ Ecclesiâ Catholicâ, &amp; omnibus orthodoxis, atque Apostolicae &amp; Catholicae fidei cultoribus.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore, where the Priest begins <HI>Etiam Domine Deus Exercituum,</HI> where he saith, <HI>&amp; pro Sacerdotibus, Regibus, &amp; Principibus,</HI> it shall be said, <HI>&amp; pro Regibus &amp; Principibus Catholicis,</HI> the Christians of this Church being subject to <HI>Infidel</HI> Princes; and a little lower, where the Priest be∣gins <HI>Tu Domine cui propter,</HI> &amp;c. where he saith, <HI>recordatione corporis &amp; sanguinis,</HI> it shall be said, <HI>Christi filii tui;</HI> and a little lower in the same Prayer, near the end, it shall be said, <HI>sanguine Christi filii tui redempta.</HI></P>
<PB N="242" REF="149"/>
<P>Furthermore, where the Deacon and Clergy praying, do say, <HI>Et pro omnibus Patriarchis, Epi∣scopis, &amp; Presbyteris,</HI> &amp;c. it shall be said, <HI>&amp; pro beatissimo Papâ nostro,</HI> naming him, <HI>&amp; pro omni∣bus Patriarchis &amp; Episcopis.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore, in the Hymn said by the Clergy and the Deacon <HI>alternatim</HI> after the elevation of the most Holy Sacrament, in the Verse where the Priest saith, <HI>Quando ad sanctum altare ingreditur, manus suas purè protendit in coelum, &amp; invitat spiritum qui de superis descendit &amp; consecrat cor∣pus &amp; sanguinem Christi,</HI> in which words the Priest seems to call upon the Holy Ghost, to come down from Heaven to consecrate the Body of Christ, as if it were not the Priest that conse∣crated it; whereas in truth it is the Priest that does it, tho' not in his own words, but the words of Christ; wherefore that no colour may be given to such an error, it shall be said, <HI>manus suas purè protendit in coelum &amp; consecrat corpus &amp; sanguinem Christi,</HI> leaving out the words of <HI>&amp; invitat spiritum qui de superis descendit,</HI> &amp;c. and the following words <HI>à saeculo usque in saeculum.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore, in the Prayer said by the Dea∣con, which begins <HI>Omnes timore pariter &amp; amore accedamus,</HI> where it is said, <HI>unigenitus Dei mortale corpus &amp; spiritualem, rationalem, immortalemque ani∣mam ex filiis hominum suscepit,</HI> that there may be no countenance given to an error held by some, and followed by several <HI>Nestorians,</HI> that the Soul as well as the Body, is <HI>ex traduce,</HI> or derived from the Parents; whereas in truth it is created
<PB N="243" REF="149"/> by God out of nothing, and infused into the Body when it is perfectly formed; it shall there∣fore be said <HI>unigenitus Dei mortale corpus ex filiis hominum, &amp; spiritualem, rationalem, immortalem∣que animam suscepit.</HI> As also where the Deacon after the Communion of the Priest, inviting the People to communicate, saith, <HI>fratres mei susci∣pite corpus ipsius filii,</HI> he shall say <HI>ipsius filii Dei.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore, in the first word of the Bene∣diction of the People, where he saith, <HI>Ille qui benedicit nos in coelis, per filium Humanitatis,</HI> he shall say <HI>Per filium suum;</HI> and in the first Blessing which the Priest gives to the People, at the end of the <HI>Mass,</HI> where he saith, <HI>Ca∣thedra gloriosa Catholicorum orientalium,</HI> meaning Schismatical <HI>Babylon,</HI> he shall say <HI>benedicatur Ca∣thedra gloriosa Romana,</HI> and in the following verse of the same Blessing, where speaking of the Bi∣shop of the Diocess, he saith, <HI>Dominus totius gre∣gis episcopus plenus sobrietate custodiatur à malo,</HI> &amp;c. he shall name our Lord the Pope, saying, <HI>Domi∣nius totius gregis catholici Papa N. plenus sobrie∣tate custodiatur à malo, una cum bono Doctore, &amp; Episcopo nostro N.</HI> naming him by his Name: And a little after in the same Blessing, where he saith, <HI>Illustris in congregatione Sanctorum religiosus Hor∣misda, sanctitas sanctitatum,</HI> &amp;c. the name of <HI>Hor∣misda,</HI> who as has been observed, was a <HI>Nesto∣rian</HI> Heretick, shall be left out, and instead there∣of he shall say, <HI>Illustris in congregatione Sancto∣rum S.

<PB N="244" REF="150"/> agreeing very well with that glorious Apostle, who first taught the Faith in these parts, and not to that false Heretick.</P>
<P>Furthermore, in the first Verse of the Blessing of the Solemn Days, where it is said of the Di∣vine Word, <HI>Qui factus est homo, &amp; operuit spe∣ciem suam in filio hominis,</HI> for fear of the <HI>Ne∣storian</HI> Doctrine it shall be said, <HI>Qui factus est homo, &amp; operuit Divinitatem suam humilitate no∣strâ;</HI> and a little lower where it is said, <HI>Benedic Ecclesiam tuam quae patitur, &amp; in ovili pessimi Dae∣monis ecce comprehenditur,</HI> it shall be said, <HI>Quae patitur infestationes a pessimo Daemone, libera il∣lam,</HI> &amp;c. for the Catholick Church tho' it be infested and persecuted by the Devil, is not held nor overcome by him, our Saviour having pro∣mised, that <HI>all the Powers of Hell shall never pre∣vail against her.</HI> And afterwards where it is said, <HI>Benedic dextrâtuâ, Christe, congregationem hanc,</HI> it shall be said, <HI>Benedic dextrâ tuâ, Jesu Christe,</HI> &amp;c. and in the same Blessing, where it is said, <HI>Salva Re∣ges nostros &amp; Duces nostros,</HI> it shall be said, <HI>Salva Reges nostros &amp; Duces nostros Catholicos,</HI> all the Kings and Princes of this Church being <HI>Infidels,</HI> and so ought not to be prayed for in the pub∣lick Prayers of the <HI>Mass;</HI> and a little after, where it is said, <HI>Sicut decet coram ipso Jesu Salva∣tore,</HI> it shall be said, <HI>Coram ipso Jesu Deo Salva∣tore,</HI> because of the <HI>Nestorian</HI> error; and in the last Verse but one of that Blessing, where it is said, <HI>Qui comedit corpus meum &amp; bibit ex sanguine meo sanctificante liberabitur ab inferno per me,</HI> the
<PB N="245" REF="150"/> words of Christ, <HI>Habet vitam aeternam,</HI> shall be used instead of <HI>Liberabitur ab inferno;</HI> and in the end of the third Blessing, where it is said, <HI>Glo∣ria illi ex omni ore Jesu Domino,</HI> it shall be said, <HI>Jesu Domino Deo,</HI> because the <HI>Nestorians</HI> do im∣piously affirm, That <HI>the name of Jesus is the name of a humane Person, and does not agree to God.</HI></P>

<P>THe Synod doth earnestly recommend it to the Priests of this Diocess to take heed in what Wine they celebrate, having been inform∣ed, That as some Churches, by reason of their Poverty, are without <HI>Portugal</HI> Wine, so where it is that the Priest keeps it in Glass Bottles, where being in a small quantity, and kept a long time, it must necessarily decay and turn to Vi∣negar, with which they celebrate notwithstand∣ing, not considering the danger there is of there being no Consecration; for remedy whereof the Synod in the strictest manner that it can, doth command, That in every Church there shall be in the Vicars keeping a sweet pipe, or small Run∣let of Wood, or a Frask, in which the Wine for the <HI>Masses</HI> shall be kept, and that the Vicars be extreamly careful, that the Wine do not decay or turn to Vinegar; which if it should happen so as to have lost the essence of Wine in the Opi∣nion of those that have good Palates, they shall not then celebrate therewith, it being a great Sacrilege to do it, seeing there can be no Conse∣cration.</P>

A demonstration that the Offices of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church are older than her Errors; it is plain likewise from the very <HI>Canon</HI> of the <HI>Mass,</HI> that when that Office was composed, <HI>Transubstantiation</HI> was not so much as dreamt of in the <HI>Roman</HI> Church; but as to the thing in hand, Cardinal <HI>Bona</HI> in the 3 Chap. of his 1 Book of <HI>Li∣turgies,</HI> saith, <HI>Ab initio Sacrificium principaliter institutum fuit, ut pub∣licè: ac solemniter fi ret, Clero &amp; populo astante ac communicante, ipse tenor Misse &amp; veteris Ecclesiae praxis evincunt; omnes enim Orati∣ones atque ipsa Canonis, verba in plurali numero tanquam plurium no∣mine, proferuntur: hinc sacerdos populum invitat ad Orationem dicens</HI> Oremus, <HI>&amp; post Communionem ait quod ore sumpsimus,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Suntque ferè omnes ejusdem tenoris Orationes quae peractâ Communione recitantur:</HI> And in the 18th Chap. of the same Book he saith, <HI>Solenne hoc fuit in utrâque Ecclesia</HI> Graeca &amp; La∣tinâ, <HI>ut unum &amp; idem Sacrificium a pluribus interdum Sacerdotibus celebraretur; Episcopo enim sive Pres∣bytero celebrante, reliqui quotquot aderant Episcopi seu Presbyteri simul celebrabant ejusdemque Sacrificii par∣ticipes erant,</HI> &amp;c. And a little af∣ter he adds, <HI>Cur autem desierit ille mos causa mihi videtur fuisse primo quidem quod fundatis ordinibus men∣dicantibus &amp; longè latéque propaga∣tis, multiplicata sunt ones a Missarum, atque adeo necesse fuit singulos Sa∣cerdotes, ut iis satisfacerent singulis diebus privatim celebrare, deinde quia charitas multorum refrixit, cessarit etiam frequens accessus ad hoc Sacramentum adeo ut hodie nec ipsi quidem ministri in plerisque Ec∣clesiis Communicent, licet Sacrificio cooperantur.</HI> To which the Cardi∣nal might have added the Intro∣duction of the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of <HI>Purga∣tory,</HI> and the consequent <HI>Doctrine</HI> of <HI>Masses</HI> being the most effectual means of delivering the Souls out of the Torments thereof. So <HI>John</HI> the IV. of <HI>Portugal,</HI> ordered ten thousand <HI>Masses</HI> to be said for his Soul, as soon as he was dead.</NOTE> <HI>Masses</HI> to be said for the Souls of their deceased Friends, and to leave something by Will that they may have <HI>Masses</HI> said for their own Souls, which will be much more profitable for them than the Feasts that they used to make for their Kindred and others in∣vited to their Funerals; which Custom shall be left off, and instead thereof, they shall give a
<PB N="260" REF="158"/> <HI>Dole</HI> to the Poor, which is also very profitable to the Souls of the departed. And that the De∣cree relating to such <HI>Masses</HI> may have its due effect, the Synod doth command, That all that shall be found to have died worth 2000 <HI>Fanoins,</HI> and have left nothing for a certain number of <HI>Masses</HI> to be said for their Souls, shall have so much taken out of their Estates before they shall be divided among the Heirs, as shall pro∣cure the saying of five <HI>Masses</HI> for their Souls, which shall be deposited by the Executors in the hands of the Church-wardens, by them to be di∣stributed among five Priests, that they may be the sooner said; and where there are more than five Priests, the Alms shall be given to the five Eldest, there not being sufficient to divide among them all; and where there is only the Vicar of the Church, the whole shall be given to him: which Custom of procuring <HI>Masses</HI> to be said for the Souls of the Faithful departed this Life, as it is used in the Universal Church, so it is what this Synod is extreamly desirous to introduce into this Bishoprick, wherein it has been totally dis∣used, recommending this Matter earnestly to the Preachers and Confessors, to persuade all Chri∣stians to it in their Sermons and Confessions, and to the Vicars to do the same in their Admonitions.</P>

<HEAD>ACTION VI. Of the Holy Sacrament of <HI>Penance</HI> and <HI>Extream Unction.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<P>THe Fourth Sacrament is that of <HI>Penance,</HI> in which the Acts of the Penitent are, as it were, the Matter, and are distinguished into these three parts, <HI>Contrition of Heart, Confession of the Mouth,</HI> and <HI>Satisfaction for Sins, according to the direction of the Confessor.</HI> It belongs to the <HI>Con∣trition of the heart,</HI> that the Penitent be sorry at his Soul for the Sins that he has committed, and detesting them, is firmly resolved not to com∣mit them any more: which <HI>Contrition,</HI> tho' it sometimes happen to be perfect through Charity, so as to reconcile one to God even before he has actually received the Sacrament of <HI>Confession,</HI> yet it can never be perfect, nor a means of reconci∣liation with God, if not attended with a readi∣ness and purpose of mind to confess those very sins which it is conversant about; such sins be∣ing no less subject than others, to the Keys and the ingagements to <HI>Confession.</HI> It belongs to the <HI>Confession of the mouth,</HI> that the Penitent Confess himself entirely to his own Priest, as to all the sins that he remembers, using all due diligence according to the length of the time, since he last Confessed himself; and this <HI>Confession</HI> is not to be only of sins in general, nor only of the
<PB N="262" REF="159"/> <HI>Species</HI> of them, but of every sin in particular, and as far as the Penitent is able to remember of their number; declaring withal, all the ag∣gravating Circumstances, and all such as change the <HI>Species;</HI> in a word, all <HI>mortal</HI> sins, how se∣cret soever, tho' only in thoughts and wicked desires; as also all faults committed against the two last Commandments; <HI>Thou shalt not covet thy Neighbours Wife; Thou shalt not covet any thing that is anothers;</HI> such sins being at some times more dangerous for the Soul, than others that are open; all which we are commanded to do by the Divine Law; our Saviour when he ascended into Heaven, leaving the Priests for his Vicars upon Earth, and constituting them Judges, before whom all <HI>mortal</HI> sins committed by Christians, were to be brought, that by the power of the Keys, which he committed to them to forgive or retain sins, they may pronounce Sentence, which cannot be just and Righteous, neither can the punishments they impose be e∣qual or proportionated to the Nature of the Faults, without their having a full knowledge of the same, as of the matter that they pass Sentence upon; which knowledge cannot be had but by the Penitents confessing all and every <HI>Mortal</HI> Sin, whereon Judgment is to pass, not only in gene∣ral, but in <HI>specie</HI> and number, making mention of every such Sin in particular, with all its ne∣cessary circumstances, that so a just sentence o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> absolution or retention may be pronounced up∣on them. And as to <HI>Venial</HI> Sins which we fre∣quently
<PB N="263" REF="159"/> fall into, and for which we are not ex∣cluded from the Grace of God, tho' the confes∣sing of, and being absolved from them, is very profitable to the Soul, yet we are not under any such precise obligation of confessing them, there being other ways by which they may be pardoned, so that it is no sin not to discover them. The third part of <HI>Penitence,</HI> is, <HI>Satisfa∣ction for Sins according to the judgment of the Con∣fessor;</HI> which <HI>satisfaction</HI> is chiefly performed by Prayer, Fasting and Alms, the Penitent being obliged to comply with the Penance imposed upon him by the Priest, who being as a Judge in the place of God, ought to impose what he thinks to be necessary, not only with respect to the amendment of Sin for the future, but chief∣ly with respect to the <HI>Satisfaction</HI> and <HI>Penance</HI> of past Sins. The Form of this Sacrament is, <HI>I absolve thee,</HI> to which necessary words the Church has thought fit to add the words following, <HI>from all thy Sins, in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</HI> There are also some Pray∣ers which the Priest saith immediately after o∣ver the Penitent, which, tho' they are not es∣sential to the form, yet are very profitable and healthful for the Penitent. Now by pronouncing the form, not only all the Sins that are confes∣sed, but all those likewise which after a due di∣ligence and Examination of the Conscience do not occurr to the Memory, so as to be discover∣ed, all such being included in the said Confessi∣on, are all pardoned; tho' with an obligation of
<PB N="264" REF="160"/> confessing them, if they should ever after come to be remembred, sins being as it were chains to the Soul, from which it is delivered by the absolution of the Priest, which is applicable to such, as by virtue of contrition joyned with a desire of confessing, have obtained pardon of God for their Sins, which they were under an obli∣gation to have confessed: as also to those Sins which were never confessed, because not re∣membred after a due diligence, and to those likewise which having been once lawfully con∣fessed and truly pardoned, are by the Penitent of his own accord, and for the greater Penance confessed and submitted to the Keys several times. The Minister of this Sacrament is a Priest, <HI>who hath Authority to absolve,</HI> and is either the <HI>Or∣dinary,</HI> as the Prelates, or such as are commission∣ed and approved of by them. The effect of this Sacrament is, <HI>The absolution and pardon of Sins,</HI> and for that reason it is by the Doctors proper∣ly called the <HI>Table after Shipwrack,</HI> because the Grace which was given to us in Baptism, being lost by the commission of <HI>Mortal</HI> Sin, by which we make Shipwrack thereof, and of all the other Vertues and Gifts, which together therewith were poured down upon us, there remains no other remedy or means whereby we can be sa∣ved, but only by the plank of <HI>Penance,</HI> or the Sacrament of <HI>Confession;</HI> for that without this ei∣ther actually received, or firmly purposed ac∣cording to the command of Holy Mother Church with contrition, wherein such a purpose is al∣ways
<PB N="265" REF="160"/> included, we cannot be saved nor enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; for which reason this Sacrament ought to be much reverenced and frequented, as the only remedy that sinners have for all their evils.</P>

<P>WHereas it belongs to the good Government of the Church and the Faithful, that Crimes of a heinous nature should be judged not by every Priest, but by Prelates or Bishops, because for that reason Christians will be the more fearful to commit them; besides that, it has always been the Custom of the Church, to reserve to the Prelates, and even to the Pope as the Universal Head of the Church, some Crimes from which they and none else can Ab∣solve, or not do it without their leave: there∣fore the Synod doth declare, That notwithstan∣ding this Doctrine has not hitherto been under∣stood or practised in this Bishoprick, by reason of the great Ignorance of the Church and sacred Canons that has reigned therein: Nevertheless, that the ordinary Confessors have no power to Absolve in cases reserved to the Prelate, and least of all in those that are reserved to the Pope, namely, those contained in the <HI>Bulla Coen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Domini;</HI> which all Confessors ought to be ac∣quainted with; neither can they Absolve in the Crime of Heresy, or in any cases wherein the Faith is concerned; all which do belong to the Court of the <HI>Holy Office of Inquisition,</HI> or to such as are Commissioned by them, or to the Bi∣shop who by himself may Absolve in the Form of the Holy Council of <HI>Trent;</HI> and according to the Ordinations of the Holy Fathers: Nei∣ther

<PB N="283" REF="169"/> by the sight; on both the Ears, because of Sins committed by hearing; on the mouth, be∣cause of Sins committed by tasting and speaking; on both the hands, for the sins committed in feeling and touching; on both the Feet, for the Sins com∣mitted in walking; on the Loins and Reins, for be∣ing the chief seat of Carnal pleasure; every one of which parts must be anointed by the Priest, making the sign of the Cross upon them with his Thumb dipt in Holy Oil, and at the same time repeating the words of the form, which are, <HI>By this Holy Ʋnction, and his most tender mercy may our Lord forgive thee all the Sins thou hast committed by thy sight;</HI> and so on, naming every part or sense as it is anointed: The effect of this Sacrament, is the Health of the Soul, and of the Body also, so far as it is convenient and necessary to the Soul, which is the chief; moreover, it washeth away the Reliques of sin, if there are any remaining in the Soul, comforting the Soul of the Sick withall, and confirming and exciting in it a great confidence in the Divine Mercy, by vir∣tue of which Consolation it suffers the troubles of Sickness with the more patience, and with the greater ease resists the Temptations of Satan, whose custom it is to assault the Soul with ex∣traordinary violence in its last Hour: It like∣wise cherishes and succours the Body, so far as it is convenient for the salvation of the Soul, as S. <HI>James</HI> teacheth us in his Canonical Epistle, saying, <HI>Is any one Sick, let him call for the Priests of the Church, and they shall pray over him, anoint∣ing
<PB N="284" REF="170"/> him with Oyl in the Name of the Lord, and the Prayer of Faith shall save the Sick, and the Lord shall give him ease, and if he be in Sins, they shall be forgiven him:</HI> The Apostle in saying <HI>they shall be pardoned,</HI> demonstrates it to be a Sacra∣ment, whose Virtue and Nature is to conferr Grace, that pardoneth Sins; and in saying, <HI>If any are sick among you,</HI> he declares the time when this Sacrament is to be received, that is in time of dangerous Sickness; and in saying, <HI>they shall call the Priests of the Church,</HI> he sheweth that the Priests are the only Ministers of this Sacrament, and in saying, <HI>they shall be anointed with Oil in the Name of the Lord,</HI> he sheweth, that Holy Oil is the matter of this Sacrament; and in saying, <HI>they shall pray over the Sick, anointing,</HI> he shew∣eth, that the form of this Sacrament is to be pro∣nounced by way of deprecation, or Prayer; and in saying, <HI>the Lord shall give him ease,</HI> he shew∣eth also, that the effect of this Sacrament is to give health to the Body, so far as it is convenient and necessary to the health of the Soul. And where∣as this Sacrament was instituted for the use of the Sick, none but what are dangerously so must take it, and a Person who shall recover after having received it, may when dangerously sick receive it again, it having been instituted by our Lord for that end; and to prepare, defend and forti∣fie us at the time of our departure out of this life, whensoever it is.</P>

<P>WHereas in this Bishoprick there has not been hitherto any use of the Sacrament of <HI>Extream Ʋnction,</HI> in which for want of Ca∣tholick Instruction, there has been no knowledge of the Institution, Effects, or Efficacy thereof; therefore the Synod does most earnestly re∣commend the use of this Sacrament, comman∣ding the Vicars to be vigilant over the Sick of their Parishes, where-ever they live, whether in the Villages or in the <HI>Heaths;</HI> and whenever they shall hear of any in danger of Death, to car∣ry the most Holy Sacrament of <HI>Ʋnction,</HI> and administer it to them according to the <HI>Roman</HI> Ceremonial, which is to be translated into <HI>Syri∣an,</HI> and kept in all Churches, anointing them with Oil, and making the sign of the Cross with Holy Oil on both their Eyes shut; doing the right first, and then the left, upon the Eye-lashes, and upon both the Ears, the Nostrils, and the Mouth, being shut, on both the Lips; but if the Distemper should be such, that the Sick Per∣son's Mouth cannot be shut, or not without dan∣ger, then the upper Lip shall be anointed, ma∣king the sign of the Cross upon it; as also both the Palms of the Hands, the Balls of the Feet and the Loins, ordering the Sick Person to be moved gently; neither is it necessary that any more of these parts should be anointed than what is convenient for the making the sign of the
<PB N="286" REF="171"/> Cross with the Holy Oil; and the Priest must be sure to remember in this, as in all other Sa∣craments, to join the Form with the Matter, re∣peating the words of the Form as he anoints the parts: If the Sick Person shall happen to ex∣pire while the Priest is anointing, the Priest be∣ing satisfied that he is dead, shall proceed no further with the Office; and the Vicar, through whose negligence any Parishioner shall die with∣out having received this Sacrament, shall be suspended from his Office and Benefice for six Months.</P>

<HEAD>ACTION VII. Of the Holy Sacraments of <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Matrimony.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Doctrine of the Sacrament of <HI>Order.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe sixth Sacrament is that of <HI>Order,</HI> which was instituted by our Lord Jesus Christ the day before he suffered for us, after that he had made an end of instituting the Sacrament of the Eucharist, that so he might institute the Sacrifice and the Priests that were to offer it together; at which time he created the Apostles Priests, giving them withal power to consecrate others, that so the Sacrifice and the Priesthood might be continued in the Church till the end of the World. The Matter of this Sacrament is that which is delivered to the Person that is ordained, for the exercise of that Order he has received; to the Priests, a Cup with Wine in it, and a Patten with Bread; to a Deacon the Book of the Gospels; and to a Sub-Deacon an empty Cup and Patten, and so as to the other inferiour Orders: The Form of the Priesthood and other Orders, are the words spoke by the Bishop when he
<PB N="289" REF="172"/> delivers to every one that which belongs to his Ministry and the exercise of his Order. The Minister of this Sacrament is only a Bishop, to whom only Christ committed the power of Consecrating Priests; the effect of it is the en∣crease of Grace, to the end that the Person or∣dained may be a fit Minister. This Sacrament was instituted by Christ as highly necessary in his Church; for a Sacrifice and Priesthood are so join∣ed, that the one cannot be without the other; wherefore since under the New Testament the visible. Sacrifice of the Holy <HI>Eucharist</HI> was to be instituted, it became therefore necessary, that there should be a new, visible and eternal Priest∣hood in the same Church, whereby the ancient Priesthood of the Old Law was translated; and there were Priests provided accordingly for the Offering of the Divine Sacrifice; which Priests be∣ing lawfully ordained, our Lord Jesus Christ has given them power over his true and real Body, to Consecrate, Offer, and Administer it, as also o∣ver his Mystical Body the Church; giving them power to pardon and retain Sins; to which power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t likewise belongs to rule and govern all Chri∣stian People, and to lead them in the way to Eternal Life. Now the Priesthood being so high an Office, that it may be exercised with the more decency and veneration, it was conveni∣ent that there should be different Orders or Ministers, who are bound by their Function to serve the Priesthood, and to be divided in such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> manner, that after having received the <HI>Clerical
<PB N="290" REF="173"/> Tonsure,</HI> they are to ascend through the lower to the higher Orders.

The Church en∣joins <HI>Continency</HI> and <HI>Chastity</HI> to all that take <HI>Holy Holy,</HI> that so being disingaged from all other business they may employ themselves whol∣ly in the Ministry of the Altar, and be intent only on matters appertaining to our Lord, and Divine Worship. The Church does not admi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Slaves</HI> to be Priests, because it is necessary to the Divine Worship, that the Ministers thereo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should be free and not subject to others, and

<HEAD>Decree I.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas it has been hitherto the Custom of this Diocess to ordain <HI>Boys</HI> even Priests, and that without examining their Lives and Manners, having for Money and not for any extraordinary sufficiency, all the Orders In∣feriour, as well as Holy, conferred upon them in one day, contrary to the Holy Canons and the Laws of the Church: Therefore the Synod doth command, That from henceforward, none be ordained but what have first been examined as to their Sufficiency, Lives, and Manners, which shall be done by the Prelate, or by some ap∣pointed by him, fearing God, and who are ob∣servers of the Holy Canons, and the Forms of the Holy Council of <HI>Trent.</HI> And whereas in the said Council it is commanded, That none be ordained Sub-Deacon under Two and Twen∣ty, nor Deacon under Three and Twenty, nor Priest till they are Five and Twenty, this Sy∣nod doth command the same to be inviolably
<PB N="292" REF="174"/> observed; declaring, that no Prelate can dispense therewith without being particularly impowered and authorized thereunto by the Apostolical See. And forasmuch as there are great numbers in this Diocess that have been ordained before they were at that Age, the Synod suspends all such, whether Priests, Deacons, or Sub-Deacons, from the exercise of their several Functions, until such time as they have perfectly attained to it, they shall nevertheless hold their Places, and reap the benefits thereof, in the same manner as if they were in the exercise of their Functions: And as to their Sufficiency, the Synod doth declare, That as the Council of <HI>Trent</HI> requires, that all that are ordained do understand <HI>Latin,</HI> so in this Diocess it is required, that all that are ordained if they do not understand <HI>Latin,</HI> should understand <HI>Sy∣rian:</HI> Neither shall any <HI>Syrian</HI> that does not un∣derstand it so well, as to be able to read and sing it, so as to understand what they say in the Offices, be admitted into Orders, or at least not into those that are Holy.</P>

<HEAD>The Doctrine of the Sacrament of <HI>Matrimony.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe seventh Sacrament is that of <HI>Matrimo∣mony,</HI> which according to the Apostle is the signification of that Union which is betwixt Christ and his Church. The efficient Cause of Matrimony regularly, is the Consent of both par∣ties declared by Words or Signs <HI>de praesenti.</HI> This Sacrament our Lord Jesus Christ Founded on the Matrimonial Contract, which has always been in the World, and in all Religions, from whence it is that Matrimony is to be considered in two respects; either as a Natural Contract, or as a Sacrament instituted by our Lord Jesus Christ: The Bond of Matrimony God hath made to be perpetual, insomuch that it cannot be dissolved by any thing but Death, according to what Christ said, <HI>Whom God hath joined let no Man put asunder;</HI> which is also in it self very con∣venient. As it is a Sacrament, there is Grace re∣ceived therein, as in other Sacraments, our Lord Christ, who was the Author and Institutor of the Divine Sacraments, having by his Passion merited Grace for us, whereby the Natural Love which is betwixt the Married couple is perfect∣ed, and the conjunction that is betwixt them is
<PB N="318" REF="187"/> confirmed, and made Perpetual, and the Hus∣band and Wife are Sanctified. There are two Reasons or Ends for which Matrimony was or∣dained and instituted; the first and principal is the Procreation or Generation of Children, for the conservation of the World, and the multi∣plication of the Faithful, and Servants of God. The second is, for a remedy for Uncleanness; and that such as are inclined to that Vice, might have a remedy given them by God, so that li∣ving with their Wives, they might not fall into that Sin, from whence it is that People may not only Marry once, but as often as one of the Parties dies, because this end of Matrimony may not only be compassed in the first, but equally in the subsequent Marriages; wherefore the Church detests those as Hereticks, who condemn second Marriages, holding them to be unlawful; as some Hereticks did anciently; and as some of the most Superstitious Heathens do at this day in these Parts; from whence it may also be collected, that this Sacrament may not only be lawfully ce∣lebrated betwixt Persons capable of having Chil∣dren, but also betwixt those, who according to the ordinary course of Nature, cannot have any, because the second end may be answered in such Marriages; but where neither the one nor the other end can be answered, as in Children, for whom the Church has set a certain time, and in such as are under a Natural Impotency that will last as long as they live, as to Matrimonial Acts, Matrimony is not to be celebrated: And
<PB N="319" REF="187"/> tho' both under the Law of Nature and of <HI>Moses,</HI> there were Dispensations whereby Matri∣mony was made to deviate from its first Origi∣nal, some of the Patriarchs having had several Wives at once by a Divine Dispensation, and the Law of <HI>Moses</HI> having permitted Divorces, or the repudiating of Wives, yet under the Evan∣gelical Law, by which Matrimony was perfected and restored again to its first Estate and Purity, it is prohibited for a Man to have more than one Wife at a time, and to turn away his Wife and take another so long as she lives. The Be∣nefits of Marriage are three principally; the first is the Generation and Education of Chil∣dren for the Worship and Service of the true God; the second is the Fidelity which the Mar∣ried couple ought to keep to one another; and the third is the Perpetuity of Matrimony, which, in that it cannot be dissolved, signifies that in∣separable Conjunction and Union that is betwixt Christ and his Church: And notwithstanding for the cause of Fornication or Adultery, it is law∣ful for the Married couple to part as to Coha∣bitation, yet it is not lawful to Marry with any other, because the Bond of Matrimony, being once lawfully tied, is Perpetual, and cannot be dissolved by any thing but the death of one of the Parties.</P>

<P>HOly Mother Church has always so ordered the celebration of <HI>Matrimony,</HI> as to make it to be understood to be a Holy thing, and that as Holy, it ought to be Holily treated; where∣fore for the removing of several inconveniencies, and those especially that attend Clandestine Mar∣riages, she has ordained and commanded, that <HI>Matrimony</HI> be celebrated in the face of the Church by the Vicar, or Parish-Priest, or some other Priest, Licensed by him or the Prelate, and in the presence of two or three Witnesses at least; and that all Marriages that are not celebrated with this Solemnity by the Parish-Priest before two Witnesses, are void and null: And that the Priest, who without leave from the Parish-Priest, and the Parish-Priest who without two Witnesses shall presume to Marry any couple, shall be severely punished. Now the Synod under∣standing that this Rule is not observed in this Diocess, but that the Persons who are to be mar∣ried do imploy any Priest, and are married where they please, from which great Inconveniencies and Disorders do many times follow, different Rites and Ceremonies being also used in divers places in the celebration thereof, doth command, that all that is above related be punctually ob∣served according to the Decrees of the Holy Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> which has been received by this Church in this Synod; declaring all Marri∣ages

<PB N="359" REF="207"/> Synod doth declare, that such Water is not Ho∣ly, and that the Faithful ought not to make use of it; and albeit that all the Earth of Holy places, and of the Sepulchres of Saints approved of by the Church, ought to be kept with much Veneration, yet that the Earth of the Holy places belonging to St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> has not the vir∣tue of such a Consecration in it: for which rea∣son it commands all Priests to bless the said Wa∣ter, by throwing Holy Salt into it, according to the custom of the Universal Church, as is di∣rected by the <HI>Roman</HI> Ceremonial translated into <HI>Syrian</HI> by the order of the most Reverend <HI>Me¦tropolitan,</HI> according to the Form whereof the true Vicars shall take care to consecrate Water, and every <HI>Saturday</HI> Evening, or <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning to furnish the Water-pots therewith; and upon <HI>Sun∣days</HI> the People being assembled, the Priest being in his <HI>Surplice</HI> and <HI>Stole,</HI> but without his <HI>Planet,</HI> shall before he begins <HI>Mass,</HI> sprinkle the whole Congre∣gation, repeating the <HI>Antiphona,</HI> and the Prayer contained in the said Ceremonial: and at <HI>Masses</HI> at which the Deacon and Sub-Deacon officiate, the Deacon may repeat the <HI>Antiphona,</HI> but the Prayer shall always be said by the Priest. The Vicars must also instruct the People at their entring into the Church, to take Holy Water and bless them∣selves therewith, in the form of a Cross, and to give over the saying the Prayer to the impious Heretick <HI>Nestorius,</HI> which they used to do when they took Holy Water as they entred into the Church, the Synod condemning the same as He∣retical and Blasphemous.</P>

<PB N="363" REF="209"/> in Christ, therefore since that Divine Name contains in it so many Divine Mysteries, being the Name of our Redemption, and the Name above all Names, <HI>At which</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>every knee in Heaven and in Earth, and below the Earth ought to bow,</HI> the Synod doth command, that as often either in the Gospel or Prayers of the <HI>Mass,</HI> or Offices, or any where else that that Name is mentioned, all People do reverently bow their Body, whether they be sitting or standing, and the Clergy and other Christians, having their Caps on shall take them off, and the Vicars and Preachers must not neg∣lect to put their People frequently in mind there∣of; and whereas the Name <HI>Lyo</HI> is the same with the most sweet Name of <HI>Jesus</HI> in the <HI>Malabar</HI> Language, and is commonly given to Children in Baptism; the Synod doth strictly prohibit the giving of that Name to any body for the future, commanding all that are called by it, to take another Name in Confirmation, or at any other time, it being a great irreverence for any one to be called by so high and Divine a Name.</P>

<P>WHereas in this Diocess there are many Churches dedicated to <HI>Marxobro</HI> and <HI>Mar∣phrod,</HI> who are commonly stiled <HI>Saints,</HI> of whom there is<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Nothing known.]</HI> At <HI>Compostella,</HI> the most famous place of Devotion in all <HI>Spain,</HI> the Peo∣ple pray to some that they know as little of, as the <HI>Malabars</HI> do of <HI>Marphrod.</HI></P>
<P>For the famous <HI>Spanish</HI> Antiqua∣ry <HI>Ambrosius Morales,</HI> in the 9th. Book of his Chronicle, gives us a particular Account of an Altar with some Names upon it that he met with there, and that had great Devotion paid to it.</P>
<Q REND="italic"><P><HI>In the famous Monastery of the</HI> Benedictine <HI>Nuns that joins to the Holy Church of St.</HI> James, saith Morales, <HI>and is dedicated to the Glorious Martyr</HI> Pelayo, <HI>whom in that Country they commonly call St.</HI> Payo, <HI>there is an</HI> Ara <HI>on the Altar, which they affirm to have been Consecrated by the Apostles, and that they themselves said Mass on it, and that it was brought thither with the blessed Body of St.</HI> James. <HI>Now there is not,</HI> saith Morales, <HI>not only no foundation for the Truth of this Story, but there is just cause to believe, that that Stone, which is at present in the same state it was in when it was first made, could never be an Altar. I observed it with great attention in the company of several great and learned Men, who had all the same thoughts of it that I had, the thing indeed being in clear and manifest for any such to doubt of; for it is visible, that the Stone is the Grave-Stone of some Heathens, with this following Inscription.</HI></P>
<Q>D M S ATIAMO ET AT∣TE T LƲMPS AO VIRIA EMO NEPTIS PIANO X<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ET S. E. C.</Q>
<P><HI>The words are very plain and clear, there not being a Letter want∣ing; so that notwithstanding the Blunders committed by the Grace in Spelling it, they may be with great ease Translated, which I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as well as I can into</HI> Spanish.</P>

<PB N="369" REF="212"/>
<P><HI>This is what the Stone contains, therefore they that Consecrated it an Altar, would have done well to have defaced the Letters, by which means they would have removed the indig∣nity that states all People in the face, that consider what a thing it is to have the most Holy Body and Blood of Christ our Redeemer, con∣secrated and placed upon the Tomb-Stone of Heathens, whereon the De∣vils are invocated.</HI></P></Q>
<P><HI>Thus far</HI> Morales.</P>
<P>But as this Stone has had a great deal of Honour done it, in coming to be Consecrated an Altar in such a famous place of Devotion, so the Persons whose Names are up∣on it, have had no less done to them, who are all great Saints in that Country, and particularly <HI>Piano,</HI> who in all probability is the St. <HI>Payo,</HI> to whom the Church and Monastery is dedicated.</P>
<P>For first, <HI>Salazar</HI> in his <HI>Spanish</HI> Martyrology upon the 30th. day of <HI>December,</HI> gives this following Account of the said Stone and Persons. Don Didacus Sequinus, <HI>Bishop of</HI> Auria, <HI>who has Epitomized the Life of his Predecessor</HI> Serran∣dus, <HI>gives therein the following Ex∣position of the Inscription that is up∣on this Altar Stone, in the</HI> Galecian <HI>Language, which History I have now by me in MSS.</HI></P>
<Q><P>Consegrada a Deos Maximo,</P>

<P><HI>Lobarinus</HI> tells us, that Don <HI>Ser∣randus</HI> after having given a de∣scription of the Altar, subjoins the following Account of it</P>
<P><Q REND="margSglQuotes">Este he ò Retrayto de Ara que deyxo escripta o Apostol Santiago, a seus discipolos, e he un tanto da que trouxa con sigo nó mar, sobre que, pausaran o santo corpo e sobre de la deria missa Arcadio 1 Bispo do Orenes en san Maria Madre; autro tanto como este esta en san Payo, de Santiago com istas mismas letras destos Santos Martyres.</Q> That is to say: <Q REND="italic">This is the Portraiture of the Altar which the Apostle St. <HI>James</HI> left, with an Inscription upon it, to his Disciples, who carried another of the same Dimensions, and with the same Inscription, along with him to Sea; upon which his Holy Body was laid, and <HI>Arcadius</HI> the first Bishop of <HI>Orenes,</HI> said Mass upon it in the Church of St. <HI>Mary</HI> the Mother of

<P>I hope the Reader will pardon me, if I offer one or two more instances of the same Nature.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Spanish</HI> Martyrology up∣on the 22d. of <HI>May,</HI> it is said, <HI>Sanctus Publius Bebius Venustus Martyr qui pontem in honorem tem∣pli beatae Mariae condidit, petente Or∣dine Oretanorum ut pateret aditus ad Templum,</HI> XX.

<P>This needs no Commentary, it being plain from the Monument it self, that this <HI>P. BAEBIƲS</HI> was a Heathen, and that <HI>Domus Di∣vina</HI> herein mentioned, was not a Church dedicated to the blessed Virgin, but to some Heathen god. And at <HI>Ebora</HI> in <HI>Portugal,</HI> St. <HI>Viarius,</HI> who infallibly cures all pains in the Loins, and for that reason is very much prayed to, was raised out of such another Heathen <HI>Roman</HI> Monument, whereon <HI>Viarum Curator</HI> was writ, as <HI>Resendius</HI> tells us.</P>
<P>But as in some places they have made Saints of Heathens, in others they have made Heathens of Saints: For in the Castle of <HI>Li∣ria</HI> in <HI>Portugal,</HI> there is over the Inner Gate a Stone Statue, with a long inscription under it, of which there is nothing legible from the ground but the word <HI>Veneris,</HI> which is very plain, the <HI>Portugueze</HI> who shewed us the place, for we were several Pro∣testants in Company, told us very gravely that the Castle was built by the <HI>Romans,</HI> and that the Statue we saw so much defaced, the Head and Arms being broke of, and the Body very much malled with Stones, was the Statue of the <HI>Roman</HI> Goddess <HI>Venus:</HI> we kept our Countenances as well as we could, perceiving plainly, that neither the Castle nor the Statue were <HI>Roman</HI> work, and the Letters of <HI>Veneris</HI> were per∣fectly Gothick, so I and two more having industriously lost our <HI>Por∣tugueze,</HI> we resolved if possible to find out the truth of the matter, and after some poring, we be∣gan to discover some more Let∣ters, and with some pains spell out the word <HI>Ante</HI> after <HI>Veneris;</HI> whereupon we concluded, that <HI>Veneris</HI> there must be a <HI>Verb,</HI> and not a <HI>Substantive,</HI> and that <HI>Vene∣ris ante</HI> must be the end of a Mon∣kish Verse: and we were quick∣ly satisfied that it was so by what followed, which was,
<Q><L>Pertransire cave, nisi prius dixeris Ave</L>
<L>Regina coeli mater,</L></Q></P>
<P>What followed was so defaced that we could make nothing of it, neither indeed were we soli∣citous about it, being abundantly satisfied from what we had read, that it was a Statue of the most
<PB N="371" REF="213"/> Blessed Virgin; when we return∣ed to our <HI>Portugueze,</HI> we asked him as we did the People also at our Inn, how he came to know certainly that it was the Statue of a Heathen Goddess, and we found him and them all in the same Story, that the Name of the Goddess was written under it, and that it was the constant Tra∣dition of the City and Country.</P></NOTE>

<P>WHereas Experience has demonstrated that many Churches have been Robbed by reason of the Poors Box being kept in them and not opened in many Years, no not when the necessities of the Churches did require it; therefore the Synod doth command, That in every Church upon the first of <HI>January</HI> there be chose four substantial and consciencious Men to be Overseers of the Poor, and to take care of the Church, who at the end of the Year shall open the Poors Box and take out all the Alms they find therein, which shall be put down in a Book by one of the four Overseers, and the said Alms shall be afterwards put into a Chest Lock∣ed with three different Keys, which shall stand in any one of their Houses as they shall agree, of which Keys the Vicar shall have one, and the other two the two Overseers, who are not the Scrivener, nor in whose Houses the Chest is not kept: He that's the Scrivener shall also have a Book, in which he shall set down the Expences of the said Alms, how much has been laid out upon the Fabrick of the Church, and in the reparation of the Walls and Roof, how much in adorning it, and in necessary Linen, and in Pictures, and in keeping it clean: And when∣soever there is any great extraordinary Expence, it shall not be made without the consent of the four Overseers, according to custom; neither

<P>THe Synod doth teach and declare, That by ancient Right always observed in the Church, Churches may be so violated in certain Cases, that it is not lawful to Celebrate in them, nor to bury the Dead until they are reconciled, which through ignorance of the Canons has not hither∣to been observed in this Bishoprick; the Cases are, <HI>when humane Blood is injuriously</HI> shed in the Church, or there is a Natural Cause given of such shedding, or of Death; as if one has a Mortal Wound given him in the Church, or a Wound that fetches Blood, notwithstanding the Wounded Person shall be got out of the Church before any Blood is shed; but if the Wound was given without the Church, notwithstanding the Blood thereof should come to be shed therein, the Church is not violated thereby; and by a Wound that is injuriously given in the Church, whereby Blood is shed, tho' the Wound should not prove Mortal, the Church is violated. The second Case is, <HI>when humane Seed is voluntari∣ly spent in the Church,</HI> tho' in conjugal Copula∣tion: The third is, <HI>when one that is Excommu∣nicated is buried in the Church:</HI> The fourth
<PB N="377" REF="216"/> <HI>when an Infidel is buried in it;</HI> in which Case the Church is not only to be reconciled, but the Walls are also to be scraped: The fifth is, <HI>when the Church has been Consecrated or Blessed by a Bishop that was publickly Excommunicate;</HI> in all which Cases the Church is to be reconciled, which reconciliation being to be done to a Church that was Consecrated by a Bishop, none but a Bishop can perform it: But having been only Blessed by one, or by a Priest, the Vicar may perform the Reconciliation, according to the Form, and with the Prayers and Ceremonies contained in the <HI>Roman</HI> Ceremonial Translated into <HI>Syrian;</HI> and it is to be observed, that when a Church is violated, the Church-yard that be∣longs to it is violated also, if they are not at some distance the one from the other; but when the Church-yard is violated in any of the forementioned Cases, the Church it belongs and is joined to, is not violated thereby.</P>

<P>WHereas the distinction of the Faithful from Unbelievers, even by outward signs and habits, is a thing which has always been endea∣voured, that so the one may be known and di∣vided from the other; therefore the Synod ha∣ving observed that there is no distinction neither in their Habits nor in their Hair, nor in any thing else, betwixt the Christians of this Diocess and the Heathen <HI>Naires,</HI> doth command, that henceforward no Christian do presume to bore their Ears, or to do any thing to make them large, except Women, among whom it is an Universal Ornament; and whosoever shall trans∣gress herein, shall be punished at the pleasure of the Prelate, who shall not suffer them to wear an Ornament of Gold or of any thing else in their Ears; and whosover shall presume to wear any such Ornament, shall be thrown out of the Church, neither shall the <HI>Casture</HI> be given them un∣til such time as they are brought to yield effectual Obedience, and to leave off all such Ornaments; but as for those whose Ears are bored already,

<HEAD>Decree XX.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas an unreasonable Custom has obtain∣ed in this Diocess, <HI>viz.</HI> That Males only inherit their Fathers Goods, the Females having no share at all thereof; and that not only when there are Sons, but when there are Daughters only, and they unmarried, and many times In∣fants, by which means great numbers of them perish, and others ruin themselves for want of necessaries, the Fathers Goods falling to the Males that are next in Blood, tho' never so re∣mote or collateral, there being no regard had to Daughters no more than if their Parents were under no obligation to provide for them; all which being very unreasonable, and contrary to the natural right that Sons and Daughters have to succeed, to the good of their Parents; the Kindred who have thus possessed themselves of such Goods, are bound to restore them to the Daughters as the lawful Heiresses to them; wherefore the Synod doth decree and declare this Custom to be Unjust, and that the next
<PB N="408" REF="232"/> a-kin can have no right when there are Daugh∣ters to inherit their Father's Estate; and being possessed of such Estates, are bound in consci∣ence to restore them; neither is it lawful for the Males to divide the Estate among them, with∣out giving any equal Portion to the Females; or if they have not done it already, they stand in∣debted for their Portions; or if the Father has disposed of the third part of his Estate by Will, the remaining two parts shall be equally divided betwixt the Sons and the Daughters, the Porti∣ons that have been received by those that are married being discounted; all which the Synod doth command to be observed, intreating and commanding all the Christians of the Diocess to receive this Decree as a Law, and observe it intirely, it being laid as a duty upon their Con∣sciences; and if any shall act otherwise, and be∣ing a Kinsman, shall seize upon the Goods be∣longing to Daughters; or being a Son, shall de∣ny to give Portions to his Sisters, or being in possession of the said Goods, shall refuse to make restitution; the Prelate, if it cannot be done otherwise, shall compell them to it by Penalties and Censures, declaring them Excommunicate, without any hope of Absolution, until such time as they shall pay an effectual Obedience, and shall make restitution.</P>

<HEAD>Decree XXI.</HEAD>
<P>THe Adoption of Sons is not lawful, but in defect of natural Children; which not be∣ing understood by the Christians of this Bishop∣rick through their ignorance of the Law, they do commonly Adopt the Children of their Slaves born in their Houses, or of other People, disin∣heriting their lawfully begotten Children, some∣times upon the account of some differences they have had with them, and sometimes only for the affection they have to Strangers, all which is contrary to Law and Reason, and is a mani∣fest injustice and wrong done to their legitimate Children; wherefore the Synod doth declare, that the said Adoptions must not be practised where there are natural Children, and being done are void, so that the Persons thus Adopted are not capable of inheriting any thing, except what may be left them by way of Legacy, which must not exceed the third of the Estate; no, not tho' the Adoption was made before there were any Legitimate Children to inherit. The Synod doth furthermore declare, That the A∣doptions which have been made before the cele∣bration of this Synod, where there are Children, and the Adopted are not in actual possession of the Estate, are void, neither shall the Adopted have any share thereof, or having had any, shall be obliged to restore it, to which if it be found necessary, the Prelate shall compell them by Pen∣nalties
<PB N="410" REF="233"/> and Censures; but as to those who by virtue of such Adoptions, have for a long time been in quiet possession of Estates, the Synod by this Decree does not intend to dispossess them thereof, by reason of the great disturbance and confusion the doing so would make in this Diocess, which is what this Synod pretends to hinder, leaving every one however in such Cases, at liberty to take their remedy at Law.</P>

<P>THe Synod being desirous to have all the Christians of this Diocess to live together in Villages, by reason of the great inconveni∣encies they are under that live in the <HI>Heaths,</HI> as well by reason of the great communication they must have with Infidels, as for wanting opportunities of going to Church, and Sacra∣ments, whereby they are kept in ignorance of Christianity, doth in order thereunto very ear∣nestly recommend it to all Christians that live in <HI>Heaths,</HI> to do all they are able, either to come and live in some Village, or to build new Villages with Churches, that so they may live more civilly, and be separated from the com∣munication of Infidels, and be the better in∣structed in the Customs of our Holy Catholick Faith, recommending it earnestly to the Vicars to persuade their Sheep thereunto, for the Spi∣ritual profit they will receive thereby: which the Prelate shall also endeavour with all his power.</P>

<P>THe Synod having taken into consideration the manifold Injustices, Oppressions and Grievances wherewith Infidel Kings and Gover∣nours do often treat the Christians of this Bi∣shoprick; and that out of enmity to our Holy Catholick Faith, and observing the necessity they
<PB N="412" REF="234"/> are in of Defence and Protection, doth with great instance desire, That his Majesty the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> would be graciously pleased to take all the Christians of this Bishoprick under his Favour and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Protection.]</HI> By this we see, the King of <HI>Cochim</HI> was not jealous without reason, that the Arch-Bishop had a State design in the great pains and charge he was at in the reduction of his Christi∣an Subjects; and tho' nothing was talked of but the <HI>Pope,</HI> and the <HI>Roman</HI> Obedience, that the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and the augmen∣tation of his strength in the <HI>Indies</HI> by the accession of so many new Subjects, was the main Spring in the Enterprize. I will not say, tho' it is probable enough, that the Arch-Bishop by magnifying this Service at the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> got first to be Governour of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and afterwards to be Go∣vernour of all the Dominions of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and President of the Council of State at <HI>Madrid;</HI> but this we are sure of, that that Ser∣vice to the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> was much boasted of here in <HI>Europe</HI> by others.

<P>But as it is visible that the in∣creasing of the <HI>Portugueze</HI> strength in the <HI>Indies,</HI> by the accession of so many new Subjects, was what both the Arch-Bishop and <HI>Spanish</HI> Government aimed at chiefly in the troublesome and chargeable reduction of this Church: So it is certain, that from this very Year 1599, the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Histo∣rians do begin to reckon the de∣clination of their strength in those parts; who give the following Account of the three Ages of their <HI>Indian</HI> Government; that it was in its Infancy till the Year 1561, and from that time till the Year 1600, in its Manhood or full strength, and ever since has been in its Old declining Age, and is now in truth become so decrepid, as to be only the Ghost of a great Name.

<P>WHereas in this Synod, Matters pertaining to our Holy Catholick Faith, the Holy Sacra∣ments of the Church, the Reformation of Affairs thereof, and the Customs of Christian People have been handled; the Synod doth command all Vicars of Churches not to fail to have all its Decrees Transcribed from the Original <HI>Malabar,</HI> and to have a Copy thereof in all their Churches, Signed by the Reverend the Arch-Deacon of this Diocess, and the Rector of the College of <HI>Vaipicotta,</HI> and upon every <HI>Sunday</HI> and <HI>Holy-day,</HI> when there is no Sermon nor no Lecture upon the <HI>Catechism</HI> set forth by the most Reverend <HI>Metropolitan,</HI> that a portion of this Synod be read to the People; but on the Seasons when the said <HI>Catechism</HI> is ordered to be read, it shall be read on <HI>Sundays,</HI> and the Synod upon <HI>Holy-days,</HI> that so all that is decreed therein may come to the knowledge of the People, and may be remembred and observed by them; the Ori∣ginal

<P>After the Decrees were read, the Bishoprick was divided into Seventy-five Parishes, whose Bounds were greater or lesser as was judged to be most convenient for the administration of the Holy Sacraments, and the Spiritual Food of the Faithful; Vicars were also nominated to them all, and the Churches that were not able to maintain a Vicar were united: The Vicars after they were named, were brought in one

After they had all, one after another, per∣formed this Ceremony, they were admonished all together in the presence of the People by the most Reverend <HI>Metropolitan,</HI> to comply with the Obligations of their Function, and being all upon their Knees before him, he delivered the following Charge to them.</P>

<P>The Speech and Admonition to the Vicars and Priests being ended, the most Reverend <HI>Metro∣politan</HI> commanded them all to Sign the Origi∣nal Decrees of the Synod, translated into <HI>Mala∣bar,</HI> desiring them, if they had the least scruple concerning any thing commanded or declared in the Synod, those excepted that have been de∣creed and decided already, that they would signifie them openly before they Subscribed, that there might be no doubt or controversie about any thing hereafter: So after several Doub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had been considered and satisfied, they did all unanimously Subscribe to the Synod.</P>
<P>Then the Books of the Synod were delivered to the most Reverend <HI>Metropolitan,</HI> who being in his <HI>Pontificals,</HI> and seated on his Throne with a Mitre on his Head, Subscribed the said
<PB N="423" REF="239"/> Decrees; which being done, a Table was set in the middle of the chief Chappel, and the De∣crees being laid upon it, all that were called to the Synod, as well Ecclesiasticks as Secular Pro∣curators, Signed and Subscribed them with their own hands before the whole Synod and People. The Synod consisted of 813, <HI>viz.</HI> 133 Priests, besides Deacons and Sub-Deacons, and others of the Clergy, and 660 Procurators of the Peo∣ple, and other principal Men of the Laity, besides the Inhabitants of the Town of <HI>Diamper,</HI> where the Synod was held, and of several other neigh∣bouring Villages; there were likewise present a great number of <HI>Portugnezes,</HI> who came along with <HI>Don Antonio De Neronha,</HI> Governour of <HI>Cochim,</HI> who together with all the other Magi∣strates of the City, assisted at the Synod.</P>
<P>The Decrees being Signed, the most Reverend <HI>Metropolitan</HI> rose up, and having taken off his Mitre, kneeled down before the High Altar, and begun the <HI>Te Deum,</HI> with which, to the great joy of all that were present, a solemn Procession <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound the Church was begun, the Quire singing that and some other Psalms, the <HI>Latines</HI> in <HI>Latin,</HI> and the <HI>Native</HI> Priests in <HI>Chaldee,</HI> and the People their Festivity in <HI>Malabar:</HI> proceeding to praise God with abundance of tears and joy, in three Tongues in the Unity of the Faith, and Good∣will among them all, for having at last obtained that, which they had so long desired of Almighty God, <HI>Three Persons, and One Nature, the Father the Son, and the Holy Ghost, who liveth and reigne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for ever: Amen.</HI></P>
<PB N="424" REF="240"/>
<P>After the Procession was over, the most Re∣verend <HI>Metropolitan</HI> going to the High Altar, read the Prayer <HI>Exaudi quaesumus, Domine,</HI> as it is in the <HI>Pontifical;</HI> which being ended, he seated himself upon his Throne with the Mitre on his Head, and his Pastoral Staff in his Hand, and directing his Discourse to the People said, <HI>I give many thanks to Almighty God the Author of all good things, for this great favour he has vouchsafed to me and you, and all the faithful People of this Bishoprick, in permitting us to celebrate this Synod maugre all the impediments which Satan the enemy of Souls, had created to obstruct it, by stirring up Contentions and Debates on purpose to separate this Christianity from the Ʋnion of the Catholick Church, and to keep them in their old Errors, as you all very well know. I do also give many thanks to God, for his having been pleased to order Matters so, that this whole Affair should end with so much Joy, Peace and Concord, as you all see it does, and so much to the sorrow of Infidel and Idolatrous Kings, and of all the other Enemies of our Holy Catholick Faith. I do also thank you my most dear Brethren and fellow Priests and Coadjutors, and you my be∣loved Sons the Procurators of the People, and all the other principal Persons who have been present at this Synod, that not regarding the troubles of the Ways and Times, nor the displeasure of the Kings to whom you are subject; you have, as true Christians desirous of Salvation, over-looked all those Inconveniencies, and obeyed our Precept in assem∣bling your selves together to treat about the good
<PB N="425" REF="240"/> of your Souls, for which God will reward you with Eternal Life, if you persevere in the purity of the Faith you have here profest, and which you have been taught by this Synod, and shall conform your Lives and Manners to its Decrees. I trust in the Lord that he will carry you back safe to your Houses, and bless you and your Families and Posterity for ever; which God of his infinite Grace and Mercy grant. Amen.</HI></P>
<P>This Discourse being ended, the most Reve∣rend <HI>Metropolitan</HI> rose up, and with abundance of tears gave his solemn Blessing to the People, and after that, the Arch-Deacon with a loud voice said, <HI>Let us depart in peace;</HI> to which the whole Synod answered in the name of Christ, <HI>Amen.</HI> And thus the <HI>Diocesan</HI> Synod ended the 26th of <HI>June,</HI> in the Year 1599, to the Honour and Praise of our Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>who with the Father and the Holy Spirit, liveth and reigneth for ever: Amen.</HI></P>
<P>The Synod being ended in conformity to what had been ordained therein, there was gi∣ven to every one of the Vicars that was nomi∣nated to any Church by the most Reverend <HI>Metropolitan,</HI> a Stone Altar, Consecrated by his <HI>Lordship</HI> for that purpose, their former Altars not having been duly Consecrated; as also a Box with the Vessels of Holy Oils, together with Directions how to use them: There was more∣over a Book of the Administration of the Sacra∣ments according to the <HI>Roman</HI> use, translated into <HI>Chaldee</HI> and <HI>Syrian,</HI> given to every Vicar,
<PB N="426" REF="241"/> and another which contained the whole Christi∣an Doctrine in the <HI>Malabar</HI> Tongue, for the instruction of Children and others, as also a Sur∣plice to be used in the administration of Sacra∣ments, which was what had never been in use among them; the Churches were also furnished with Corporals, Vestments, Frontals, Cups, and what-ever else was necessary to the Ministry of the Altar, all which were wanting in most Churches; and all the Controversies, whether betwixt Corporations or particular Persons, that were brought before the Synod, were decided by the most Reverend <HI>Metropolitan</HI> and his Asses∣sors, after which they all departed in peace.</P>
<P>The most Reverend <HI>Metropolitan,</HI> as soon as the Synod was ended, begun his Visitation of all the Churches in the Diocess, in order to put the Decrees of the Synod in execution, reciting the principal and most necessary of them in every Church, and delivering the Books, Breviaries, and Missals, as well of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Churches as of par∣ticular Persons every where, and burning the Books condemned by the Synod, and correcting others, puting the Vicars in possession of their Churches, who were every where received as such by the People, who settled Revenues upon them; of which, together with what was given them by the most Reverend <HI>Metropolitan,</HI> they made <HI>Ollas,</HI> or Instruments in the Churches, cre∣ating four Church-wardens, and opening the Church Boxes, and in a word, ordering whate∣ver was necessary to be done. The Clergy,
<PB N="427" REF="241"/> who had not been present at the Synod, made a profession of the Faith, the Confessors were ex∣amined, and had Licences given them in writing according to their abilities, and the necessity of the Church, prohibiting all others to hear Con∣fessions: Where there was a Font, they also Baptized all the Children that they found un∣christened, and had those brought in that were in the <HI>Heaths,</HI> where there were many that were Eight and Ten Years old unchristened. They Confirmed the whole People, and Absolved all that were Excommunicate; many of which, ac∣cording to their custom, had continued so for twenty or thirty Years, and especially for Mur∣ther, for which they never grant Absolution, no not at the hour of death; the <HI>Metropolitan</HI> preach∣ed every day to Christians in the Church, and to Infidels (who flocked to see him) in the Church Porch, treating with them about Baptism when he came to say <HI>Ingredimini in Sanctam Dei Ec∣clesiam,</HI> several of which he persuaded to turn Christians, who after having learned their Cate∣chism, were Baptized by him at other places: He Catechized the Children in the <HI>Malabar</HI> Tongue; and finding there was none of them that understood their Catechism, he ordered them to be taught it every day out of Books that were kept in the Church. Finally, where he met with any that were disposed to Marry, he Married them, and gave Orders about every thing else relating to the Synod, which he did in the Form following.</P>
<PB N="428" REF="242"/>
<P>After the most Reverend <HI>Metropolitan</HI> had been received by the whole People with great Joy and Festivity, according to their fashion, and carried in Procession to the Church, the way as he went being covered with Cloth or Mats, or Boughs of Trees, after the common Ceremony of Blessing and Absolution, the whole People both Men and Women, came with a most profound Humility and Reverence to kiss his Hands, and to yield Obedience to him; he went to Church betimes in the Morning with the whole Clergy and People; where after ha∣ving Confessed himself before the High Altar, which he did for the great need there was of having those Christians instructed in the Sacrament of Confession, which was in use among them but in few places, he said <HI>Mass.</HI> When <HI>Mass</HI> was ended, Father <HI>Francisco Roz,</HI> Master of the <HI>Chal∣dean</HI> and <HI>Syrian</HI> Languages in the <HI>Jesuites</HI> Col∣lege at <HI>Vaipicotta,</HI> with the rest of the Fathers deputed to that Work, and some of the most learned <HI>Caçanares</HI> assembled together in the Sa∣cristy, or in some other place appointed, where in obedience to the Excommunication of the Synod, all the <HI>Syrian</HI> Books were brought be∣fore them, as well those that belonged to the Churches, as those belonging to private Persons; all which were emended, delivering those which were condemned by the Synod to the <HI>Metro∣politan,</HI> who burnt them all. The <HI>Metropolitan</HI> having in the mean time put on his <HI>Pontificals,</HI> sat down and Preached at length to the People,
<PB N="429" REF="242"/> all the necessary Doctrines of Faith and Man∣ners; after which Discourse the chief Decrees of the Synod were published, and a Processi∣on for the Dead was made round the Church, to which such vast multitudes of Heathens re∣sorted to see the Novelty, and the <HI>Pontifical</HI> Vestments, that they filled the Church-yard and Windows: After the Procession for the Dead was ended, and the Doctrine of <HI>Purgatory,</HI> and the benefits of praying for them declared, the <HI>Metropolitan</HI> having seated himself, began a Dis∣course of the Sacrament of <HI>Confirmation,</HI> accor∣ding to the necessities of the People, and after that Anointed all that were present, then he Baptized all the Children of Christian Parents in his <HI>Pontificals,</HI> and such of the adult Hea∣thens as desired it, who were called together the day before to that purpose. The <HI>Metropo∣litan</HI> whenever he came to the words <HI>Ingredimi∣ni Sanctam Dei Ecclesiam,</HI> beginning a Discourse to the Heathens and <HI>Naires,</HI> that flocked to see the Ceremony performed, who tho' all Armed with Bows and Arrows and other Weapons, and in their own Country remote from the <HI>Portu∣guezes,</HI> did quietly and chearfully hear all that he said to them, not only concerning the Faith of Jesus Christ, but also the indignities and hard words which he bestowed upon their Idols and Priests in order to undeceive them: When the Sermon and Baptism was over, the Ecclesiasticks that were not present at the Synod, made a pro∣fession of the Faith before the People in the
<PB N="430" REF="243"/> hands of the <HI>Metropolitan,</HI> and having called all the Children together, and ordering them to kneel round his Chair, he began a <HI>Chamaz,</HI> or set of Prayers in their own Tongue, which they all said after him, and having Blessed them all, made a Discourse to them suitable to their Age, to the great satisfaction of their Parents, teaching them the Veneration that is due to the most sweet Name of <HI>Jesus,</HI> to which, agreeable to the <HI>Nestorian</HI> Doctrine wherein they had been edu∣cated, they had payed no manner of Respect: After that he inducted the Vicar in the presence of the People, charging him with the Flock which received him for their Pastor, and where there were any to be Married he Married them; great numbers also Confessed themselves to him, and received the most Holy Sacrament at his hands, among whom were abundance of Ancient People, who had never Confessed themselves be∣fore: In the Evening the People assembled to∣gether and agreed about the Stipend, they de∣termined to settle upon their Vicar, which was Registred in <HI>Ollas,</HI> that were to be kept in the Church; and having opened the Money-Box of the Church, they distributed such Alms as they thought necessary. The <HI>Metropolitan</HI> and the Fathers that were in his Company, having ex∣amined the <HI>Caçanares,</HI> to such as he found to be qualified for it, he granted a Licence in writing to be Confessors; after that he heard all the Com∣plaints and Controversies that were among Christi∣ans, and having those four principal Men, with the
<PB N="431" REF="243"/> consent of the Parties, they decided them all according to the Customs of the Country, and the Judgment of the <HI>Metropolitan,</HI> so as to exclude all farther Process or Appeals; be then Absol∣ved all that were Excommunicate, and several that had lain twenty or thirty Years under that Censure, there being several Cases wherein they were so barbarous, as never to grant Absoluti∣on, no not at the hour of Death, injoyning every one such Penances as were suitable to their Faults, omitting nothing that he judged necessary to the good of the Church and People; in all which he was accompanied and assisted by five <HI>Jesuites,</HI> who were all zealous for the Salvation of Souls, and well skilled in the <HI>Malabar</HI> Tongue, and two of them in the <HI>Chaldee</HI> also; they were Father <HI>Hieronymo Cotta,</HI> Father <HI>Jorgye de Crasto,</HI> Father <HI>Francisco Roz,</HI> who is now the most wor∣thy Bishop of that Diocess, Father <HI>Antonio To∣scano,</HI> and Brother <HI>John Maria:</HI> Father <HI>Frey Braz de Santa Maria,</HI> a Divine of the Order of St. <HI>Austin,</HI> was Confessor to the most Illustrious <HI>Metropolitan;</HI> there were also three Canons of the <HI>Metropolitan</HI> Church of <HI>Goa,</HI> and the <HI>Metro∣politan</HI>'s two Chaplains, and several <HI>Caçanares</HI> that were Natives, who celebrated the Divine Offices both in <HI>Chaldee</HI> and <HI>Syrian,</HI> whom the most Illustrious <HI>Metropolitan</HI> made great use of in several Occasions. In the reduction of this Church to the Catholick Faith, many remarkable things happened, in which God manifested how much that Work was for his Service; and in
<PB N="432" REF="244"/> the Visitation of the Churches there were se¦veral Successes of great edification, and that were much for God's Praise, which shall, God willing be written in another place, for his Glory <HI>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> liveth and reigneth for ever.

<HEAD>The Letter of <HI>Dom Andre</HI> Bishop of <HI>Cochi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> to the Synod, being Assembled.</HEAD>
<P>BRethren, in my judgment all you who are cal¦led the <HI>Christians</HI> of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> do owe much to God for his having by means of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Apostle, chose you from among such multitudes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Infidels as the <HI>East</HI> is filled with, to enlight<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> your understandings with the Truth, and for having made you, as St. <HI>Peter</HI> saith, <HI>a Holy Nation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> purchased People:</HI> For you are not to imagine that your Forefathers did deserve more at the hands of God, than the other Infidels that were their Con∣temporaries, and yet you see how God was pleased to chuse them, and you by their means, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the same time he left others and their Poster<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> in their natural Misery; for which there can be no other Cause assigned, but that it was the Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of God to extend that Mercy to you and your Forefathers, which he denied to all the other Peo∣ple of these Parts; and what makes this Mercy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be the greater and more Illustrious, is, That Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was pleased to bring you to the Faith, not by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ministry of some obscure Person of small Authority,
<PB N="433" REF="244"/> which has been the Case of many other Christians, but by sending two chosen and beloved Apostles to you, for your greater Honour, and that this Church might justly stile it self <HI>Apostolical;</HI> a privilege that was granted but to few Churches that are now in being in the World, and which the Metropolitan of <HI>Con∣stantinople</HI> was long ago ambitious of usurping to himself, if he might have been permitted. But Satan, the great Enemy to all that's Good, envying the great Glory of this Church, laboured to sow the Tares of Errours and Heresies in this Field of Christ's, and the Apostle St. <HI>Thomas;</HI> and so coming from <HI>Babylon</HI> and the Land of the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> he brought along with him some of the Disciples of the perfidious <HI>Nestorius</HI> to pervert this Church<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> This <HI>Nestorius</HI> was condemned as a Heretick in <HI>Asia minor,</HI> in the City of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> in a Council of <HI>200</HI> Bishops, and afterwards in a Council of <HI>630</HI> Bishops: He was so wicked and perverse an Heretick, that besides the punishment inflicted on him for his Sins by Men, God also begun to pu∣nish him in this Life, giving him as it were an earnest of those Punishments and Torments which he is now suffering in Hell; for besides his being deposed and deprived of his Bishoprick, and Condemned by the forementioned and other follow∣ing Councils, and Banished by the Sentence of the Emperour <HI>Theodosius</HI> the <HI>II.</HI> who then Reigned, in the Desarts of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and his having his Books <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rned by the command of the said Emperour be∣fore his death, his Tongue with which he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d uttered such great Blasphemies, rotted in his Mouth,

The Disciples of this cursed Heretick being brought into this Church by the Devil, sowed their Errours in it without being observed by you, who were a simple sincere People; insomuch that St. <HI>Thomas</HI> when he was on Earth, might have said the same that St. <HI>Paul</HI> did to those of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> where <HI>Nestorius</HI> was afterwards Condemned; <HI>I know that after my departure greedy Wolves shall come among you, not sparing the Flock:</HI> And well might the Pastors you have had among you be called <HI>devouring Wolves,</HI> who being a base and inconsiderable People, had no other intent but to rob you of all they could, taking Money for Orders,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dispensations.]</HI> What could the poor <HI>Malavars</HI> con∣clude from hence, but that either no such thing as the taking of Money for Dispensations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was ever heard of in the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Church, or that the Declamer was one of a strange assurance to condemn the doing of it at such a Tragical rare as he does.</NOTE> Dispensations, for Absolutions, and for all Sacraments and Sacred things, as you very well know; a thing so abominable in the sight of God, that St. <HI>Peter</HI> the Prince of the Apostles, for this Sin only threw <HI>Simon Magus</HI> out of the Church, and Excommunicated him, as you may see in the <HI>Acts of the Apostles;</HI> insomuch, Brethren, that we see that fulfill'd in you, and in your Prelates, who came from <HI>Babylon,</HI> which was foretold by God
<PB N="435" REF="245"/> so many Years before by the Prophet <HI>Isaiah, The Shepherds themselves had no understanding, they have all gone out of the Way, and from the first to the last are all turned to Cove∣tousness.</HI> For God's sake, Brethren, tell me what sort of Prelates and Bishops could they be, who sought nothing but their own Interest; and who gave Orders and Dispensations, and did every thing that belongs to a Bishop, without being Bishops themselves, or so much as Priests or Clerks, but were pure Laicks, as they themselves afterwards con∣fessed: What Dispensation, what Sacrament, what Grace, could he who was dispensed with and or∣dained, receive from those who were no Bishops, nor so much as Clerks, but pure Laicks, nay <HI>Lascares,</HI> in whose Habit they came out of their own Coun∣try. Brethren, this is the Fruit which they send you from <HI>Babylon,</HI> Hereticks and pure Laicks, and Barbarians for Bishops: Tell me what has <HI>Mala∣bar</HI> to do with <HI>Babylon,</HI> and what correspondence is there betwixt the most pure Doctrine of Christ, which was preached to you by the great Apostle St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> and the barbarous Errours which were brought hither by <HI>Arabians</HI> and <HI>Chaldeans</HI> from <HI>Ba∣bylon;</HI> and from their Master the Apostate <HI>Nesto∣rius?</HI> Believe me, Brethren, these are they of whom St. <HI>Paul</HI> spoke in his Epistle to his Scholar <HI>Titus, That there should come Men teaching what they ought not to teach, for filthy lucre:</HI> And so it fell out for these Men, that they might not lose the Profits and Honours they were unjustly possessed of, did all they could to put into your

<SALUTE>To the most Illustrious and Reverend Lord <HI>Dom Andre,</HI> the most worthy Bishop of <HI>Cochim;</HI> The Diocesan Synod of the Christians of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> of the Bishoprick of the <HI>Serra,</HI> assembled in the Town of <HI>Diamper,</HI> wisheth eternal Health and Pro∣sperity in our Lord.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OƲr most Reverend <HI>Metropolitan</HI> ordered your most Illustrious <HI>Lordship's</HI> Letter to this Synod to be read in a full Assembly of the Priests and People; and having heard and understood it, we rejoiced exceedingly in the Lord, to perceive that the Holy Doctrine taught us by your <HI>Lordship,</HI> is the same with that our <HI>Metro∣politan</HI> has preached in all our Churches, and has declared in this Synod, as also the same that is preached by the Fathers all over this Diocess, by which means we are the more confirmed in the Catholick Faith, and the Obedience we owe to the Holy <HI>Roman</HI> Church, our true Mother, and to our Lord the <HI>Pope,</HI> the Successor of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and Christ's Vicar upon Earth, as is manifest from the Acts of the said Synod, Signed by Ʋs, as your Lordship may see; and if we have hitherto been
<PB N="441" REF="248"/> wanting to our Duty in these Matters, it did not proceed from any Obstinacy of Mind, or from any Inclination we had to be Hereticks, or Schismaticks, but purely for want of the Light of true Doctrine and healthful and Catholick Food, which was not given us by our Pre∣lates, but who did instead thereof, poyson us with the false Doctrines of <HI>Nestorius,</HI> and several other Errors; from which we are now, by the Divine Mercy, rescued; and by the goodness of God, and the Ministry of our <HI>Metropolitan,</HI> enlightened: from whence also rose the Rebellion which was made by us, when the Truth began to be first preached to us; as also all the Troubles and Vex∣ations that we gave to our <HI>Metropolitan,</HI> and the manifest Dangers we exposed him to; for all which we are now heartily sorry, and do dayly more and more lament it: But whereas God has been plea∣sed to enlighten us with his Doctrine, the <HI>Metro∣politan</HI> being discouraged by none of those things to go on preaching in our Churches, the light of the Truth coming to us by that means, we have cordially embraced, and have with an unanimous consent and great alacrity, made profession thereof in this Synod; having also put the Affairs of our Church in the best Order we were able, and sub∣mitting our selves to the Judgment of our <HI>Metro∣politan Mar Aleixo,</HI> who as our Master, has instructed us in all things: But whereas his Lord∣ship, after his Visitation of this Diocess is over, is to go to reside in his<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Own Diocess.]</HI> The Arch-Bishop cured them of these fears, for some time at least, at the end of his Visitation, when he made a solemn renunciation of the Arch-Bishoprick of <HI>God,</HI> and as solemn an acceptation of that of the <HI>Serra,</HI> and that judi∣cially and in Form; desiring the Christians of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> to whom he delivered both those Instru∣ments, to sollicite the Pope and King of <HI>Spain</HI> to give way to the Translation; and promising with∣al to employ all his own interest in both to perswade them to it; but it seems all would not do, for the next News we hear of him, is, That instead of being gratified with the Arch-Bishoprick of the <HI>Serra,</HI> he was condemned to be Governour-General of the <HI>In∣dies</HI> for three Years, and after that translated to the Primacy of <HI>Portugal.</HI></NOTE> own Diocess, which we
<PB N="442" REF="249"/> take notice of to our great Sorrow, by which means we shall want a Special Protection; we do therefore beg, that until such time as God shall be pleased to send the Pastor among us, which we expect from the Holy Apostolical See, your Lordship, as being the Prelate that lives nearest to us, and from whom and your Predecessors, this Church has re∣ceived so many Favors, would be pleased to take us under your protection, and to concern your self in all our Affairs, and to favour the Prelate, which the <HI>Metropolitan</HI> with his wonted kindness and benignity to his Flock, intends to leave among us. And seeing your most Illustrious <HI>Lordship</HI> in your Charity has been pleased to favour us with a Letter, we take confidence from thence, to beg of you, That whereas our Priests, both for their Spi∣ritual Consolation, and other Necessities, do frequent∣ly resort to your City and several parts of your Diocess, where it will be necessary for them to say Mass, which they have hitherto been hindred from doing, by reason of their not being in a perfect Ʋnion with the Holy Mother Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> we now being in such an Ʋnion, as much as can be desired, the Synod doth humbly beseech your
<PB N="443" REF="249"/> Lordship that you would be pleased to give leave to such of our Priests as have a Licence from our Prelate to say Mass in your Churches, at least the <HI>Roman</HI> translated into <HI>Syrian,</HI> that it may ap∣pear thereby that we are all one in the Ʋnity of one only Catholick Church; and that the division which Satan had made betwixt us, and most other Chur∣ches is at an end, all Churches making one one∣ly Catholick Church, as your Lordship has clear∣ly taught us, as a vigilant Pastor, in your learned Letter. The Lord preserve your <HI>Lordship's</HI> most Illustrious Person, and prolong your Years, for the good of the Church and the profit of the Sheep of Christ.</P>

<HEAD>A Preface to a MISSAL.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>The <HI>Mass</HI> that is henceforth to be used by the ancient Christians of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> of the Bishoprick of <HI>Angamale</HI> in the <HI>Serra</HI> of <HI>Malabar,</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> purged of the <HI>Nestorian</HI> Errors and Blasphemies it abounded with, by the most Illustrious and Reverend <HI>Dom Frey Aleixo De Menezes,</HI> Arch-Bi∣shop of <HI>Goa,</HI> and Primate of the <HI>Indies,</HI> at the time when he reduced them to the Obedi∣ence of the Holy <HI>Roman</HI> Church. Translated word for word out of <HI>Syriack</HI> or <HI>Syrian,</HI> into <HI>Latin.</HI></P>
</HEADNOTE>
<P>AMong the other things which the most Reverend Arch-Bishop of <HI>Goa,</HI> and Primate of the <HI>Indies, Dom Frey Aleixo de Menezes,</HI> put in Order in the <HI>Diocesan</HI> Synod, assembled by him in the Bishop∣rick of <HI>Angamale</HI> of the <HI>Serra</HI> of <HI>Malabar,</HI>
<PB REF="250"/> of the Christians of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> in which he purged the Church of the <HI>Nestorian</HI> Heresies, and reduced it to the Obedience of the Holy <HI>Roman</HI> Church; one of the chief was the reforming the <HI>Syrian</HI> Mass, which was said in the <HI>Chaldee</HI> Tongue in this Bishoprick, which having been com∣posed or inlarged by <HI>Nestorian</HI> Hereticks, was full of Errors and Blasphemies both in the Prayers and Commemorations of <HI>Nestorius, Theodorus,</HI> and <HI>Diodorus,</HI> and se∣veral other <HI>Nestorian</HI> Hereticks, to whom as to Saints, they prayed, for to intercede for them: And whereas this People was in a profound Ignorance, nay the very Bishops, who came from <HI>Babylon,</HI> not knowing the true Form of Consecration, all of them adding to it and taking from it at their pleasure; there being no certain particular Form of Consecration among them, un∣til a certain Arch-Bishop came who had more knowledge than the rest in Eccle∣siastical Matters, and the Holy Scriptures; who perceiving that the Form wherewith they Consecrated, contained in it some
<PB REF="251"/> Errors, contrary to the Truth of the Di∣vine Sacrament, did establish the true Form, adding some words to it, both in the Consecration of the Body and Blood, in contradiction to the Error and Heresie of those who say that the Sacrament is <HI>only the Figure of the Body of Christ our Lord.</HI> From whence it is more than probable, the Hereticks of our Times, the revivers of the Errors of all the ancient condem∣ned Sects, took this Opinion: The Form established by the forementioned Arch-Bi∣shop, was, <HI>This is in truth my Body; this is in truth the Cup of my Blood, which was shed for you and for many, for the propitia∣tion and remission of your Sins; and this shall be a Pledge to you for ever and ever;</HI> in which Form they have now Consecrated for several Years. But the most Reve∣rend Arch-Bishop Primate, having remo∣ved the words that are not necessary, e∣stablished the proper Form used in the Catholick Church, as it is in the <HI>Roman Missal,</HI> laying aside divers and Sacrilegious and ignorant Ceremonies also, which sig∣nified
<PB REF="251"/> some Heresies and Errors that were amongst them: And having thus refor∣med their <HI>Mass,</HI> he continued it however in its ancient Form, until such time as he had consulted the Apostolical <HI>See</HI> about it, to know what our Lord the Pope would determine in that Matter; many of the emendations are noted in the Synod, <HI>Dec.</HI> 10. <HI>Act.</HI> 5. of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, and in the Action of Matters of Faith, where they are to be seen; I shall here present the Curious only with the <HI>Mass</HI> re∣formed, and as its said among them at this time.</P>
<TAILNOTE>
<P><HI>I</HI> Have Published this <HI>Preface</HI> for the sake of the Testimony that is therein, of this Church's not having believed <HI>Transubstantiation,</HI> but have forbore to Print the <HI>Missal</HI> it belongs to, because it is the <HI>Missal</HI> that was imposed upon this Church by Arch-Bishop <HI>Menezes,</HI> or their Old <HI>Missal,</HI> so altered and mangled by him, as to be truly what Father <HI>Simon</HI> calls it, <HI>A confused indigested Office, and withal very tedious.</HI></P>
