<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Reader,</HI></P>
<P>I Have now neither time to write the particulars of the History of that Flou∣rishing Island of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> nor conveniency to insert it into this Book of the Laws of that Country, because I should thereby make it to swell be∣yond the intended convenien∣cy of a Pocket-Book. But for the better satisfaction of any that may be inclin'd to remove themselves to that Island, I have been desired to write
<PB REF="3"/>this short (but true) account of that Country; which please to take as followeth.</P>
<P>The Island of <HI>Jamaica</HI> fell first into the Possession of the <HI>English</HI> the 10th. day of <HI>May,</HI> in the year 1655. The Middle of it is situated nearest in 17 degrees 40 minutes of North Latitude, so that their longest day from Sun Rising to Sun Setting is 13 hours 4 minutes, and their shortest 10 hours 56 minutes, The difference of Longitude, from the Meridian of <HI>London,</HI> to the Meridian which passes over <HI>Port-Royal</HI> (the chiefest Town there,) is 78 degrees 45 minutes West∣ward, which causes 5 hours 15 minutes difference in time, so that when it is Noon-day
<PB REF="3"/>there, it is a quarter of an hour past 5 in the Afternoon in <HI>Lon∣don.</HI> The length of the Island lies nearest East and West, and is accounted to be 180 Miles, and the bredth in the broadest part of it 45 Miles, so that its Figure is nearest an Oval. It lies under that which is called the <HI>Torrid Zone,</HI> ne∣vertheless the Air is moderate∣ly temperate, occasion'd by the long absence of the Sun every night, by the strong Easterly <HI>Breezes</HI> which generally blow from 8 or 9 in the Morning to 4 or 5 in the Afternoon, and by the Land Wind, which is a small cool <HI>Breeze</HI> that comes off the Shoar from all parts of the Island in the Evening, and blows gently all
<PB REF="4"/>Night. The Nights are for the most part fair, and not a Cloud to be seen in the Sky, so that by their clearness and coolness they are exceedingly pleasant; The Day time is much more hot and trouble∣some, by reason of the Sun, and the Sea Wind, which most days blows very hard; If the weather be such as is ac∣counted seasonable, it com∣monly rains a shower in the inland parts under the Moun∣tains more or less every Day, about 1 or 2 a Clock, from the beginning of <HI>April,</HI> to the beginning of <HI>December,</HI> with Thunder and Lightning, and this makes the Island fertile, especially if accompanied with those they call the general sea∣sons,
<PB REF="4"/>which are commonly great rains in <HI>May</HI> and <HI>Novem∣ber,</HI> that continue Night and day with small intermission for 8 or 10 Days together, but these failing (as sometimes they do) is prejudicial to all things in the Country; the rest of the Year is for the most part very fair and delicate weather, with∣out much rain. Thunder, or Lightning, and not at all too hot. There are Earthquakes sometimes, two or three per∣haps in a Year, but so moderate that they are over before one can well be sensible what they are, and never have yet been so violent to do any harm, The Middle parts of the Island are very full of Mountains, which towards the Eastward
<PB REF="5"/>end of it, are so high that they are not habitable, scarce accessible, These Mountains for the most part are covered with large Timber-trees of di∣vers sorts of Wood fitting for building and several uses, as well as for bearing many sorts of Fruits, which maintain great plenty of Pigeons, Doves, Parots, and other sorts of Birds, and also of wild Hoggs, all very good for food, betwixt these Mountains there run many Rivers, several whereof by the acquisition of divers of the smaller Rivulets become large, but few Navigable, by reason they are for the most part barr'd at their falling into the Sea, and many of them sinking into the ground (when
<PB REF="5"/>they come into the Low∣lands) before they can reach thither; these Rivers are well stored with good Fish, Mul∣lets, Creafish, and Eeles, such as are in <HI>England,</HI> the rest strangers to the <HI>English</HI> Cli∣mate, though all very sitting to be eaten. The Sea about this Island is also plentifully stored with many sorts of ve∣ry good Fish, and likewise with Tortoise, and Manates, both pleasant and delicious Food. The Low-lands and Plain grounds, are where the People generally Inhabit, and in these are Level tracts of several Miles in length and bredth, like our Meadows, (full of Grass) called <HI>Savan∣nas</HI> (which Name they retain
<PB REF="6"/>from the <HI>Spaniards</HI>) in these are bred great plenty of Cattle, Sheep, Horses, Asses and Mules, sufficient both for food and service, there is also in the Country great stocks of Hogs, Hens, Ducks, Pigeons, Rab∣bets, Turkeys, and divers kinds of wild Fowl, and also suffi∣cient stores of all sorts of Gar∣den Herbs and Roots, Pulse and Sallads, and with excel∣lent Fruits, some known here, as Grapes of divers sorts, and from several Countries, Le∣mons, Oranges, Citrons, Pom∣granats, and Musk Mellons, besides other very good Fruits, proper to that Country, as the Celebrated Pine, &amp; many more not much inferiour to that incomparable Fruit, and that
<PB REF="6"/>which makes these Fruits of the more use and beauty, and the Country thereby the more pleasant, is, that they (as well as the leaves on all the Trees) continue all the Year, there being no Winter, or decay, but a continual Spring, on every seasonable shower of rain, so that there is nothing wanting, for a necessary, plen∣tiful, or delicate living; In this Island are many conveni∣ent Harbours for Shipping, besides several Bays and Roads fitting for the landing or take∣ing off of Goods: The chief∣est of these is <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> which in its safety for Ship∣ping, depth of Water clean∣ness of Ground, and conve∣niency of the Shore and
<PB REF="7"/>Wharfs, for lading and un∣lading of Shipping, may compare with any in the known World, and to add the more to the security of this, and the other Harbours of this Island, those dreadful Hur∣ricans, which often afflict the Islands of <HI>Barbados, Nevis,</HI> &amp;c. never yet came near this Country. Adjoyning to this Harbour, on an <HI>Isthmus</HI> of Land, is a handsome Town of the same Name, built from the Foundation by the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> the ground it stands on is but 53 Acres, and cannot be inlarged in its buildings o∣therwise then what the Inha∣bitants gain by the height of their Houses, for it's incom∣passed all round with the Har∣bour
<PB REF="7"/>and Sea, unless on the East part, and there the <HI>Isthmus</HI> being narrow, is cut off from the Sea to the Harbour, with a strong and well fortified Wall, built with Brick and Stone, and sufficiently Gunn'd, to secure the Town from any attempt from the Land part, without which Wall none are suffered to build, that so there may be no shelter for an Ene∣my; This Town for its bigness is very Populous, and contains about a 1000 Houses, many of which are built with Bricks, and beautified with Balconies, after the modern way of build∣ing in <HI>London;</HI> the Streets are also regular, and kept very clean; there is also in it a fair Church built with Brick
<PB REF="8"/>and Stone, and handsomely finished within, and for the defence of the Town and Har∣bour, there are 5 Forts strong∣ly built with Stone, on which are mounted about 110 large Guns, all kept in good order; hither resort most of the Ships, here is the Custom-house, here live the Merchants, and here is mannaged the chiefest part of the Trade of the Island; To this Harbour belongs a∣bout 100 fine sailing Sloops, from about 12 Tuns to 40 Tuns in bigness, most of them built in the Country, which find very good imployment in trading and carrying goods about the Island, and to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> catching of Tor∣toise, and other ways, by which
<PB REF="8"/>their owners live very well. About 7 Leagues to the West∣ward of this is an old Harbour, a very large, good and safe Harbour for Shipping, and here also is a small Town built, which daily encreases, as the inland parts of the Country a∣bout it, are more and more setled and planted; More Westerly is <HI>Carlisle Bay,</HI> a safe Road for Shipping, and there is likewise built a pretty Town of that name, of about 100 Houses, which has a fine Trade, that also increases, as the Coun∣try does in Plantations; farther West is <HI>Bluefields Bay,</HI> and o∣ther good Roads, and the like there is also in St. <HI>James</HI>'s, St. <HI>Anns,</HI> and St. <HI>Maries,</HI> on the North side of the Island, and
<PB REF="9"/>in the Parish of St. <HI>Georges</HI> in the North-East parts, is <HI>Port Antonio,</HI> a safe and good Harbour, and such ano∣ther in the South-East part, called <HI>Port Morant,</HI> besides divers good Bays more on the South side, as <HI>Morant Yallahs,</HI> &amp;c. So that there want not conveniencies for the Import∣ing or Exporting of their Com∣modities, in any part of the Country. There are no Poy∣sonous or hurtful Creatures known to be in this Island, nor any voracious but the <HI>Cro∣codil,</HI> of which though there are many in the Sea, and the Rivers, yet it is rare to hear of any injury done by them. There is but one Town in the inland parts of the Country,
<PB REF="9"/>and that is called St. <HI>Jago de la Vega,</HI> it is seated near the banks of a fine River on the one side, and on the other is A large Plain, or <HI>Savanna</HI> of several Miles extent, it is a∣bout 6 Miles from the Sea of <HI>Port Royal</HI> Harbour, and was built by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> many years since, and in their time was a large Town, and well built after their manner, but on the first Peopling of the Island by the <HI>English,</HI> (when they were only an Army) ma∣ny of the Houses were de∣stroy'd by the Souldiers, and have not since been rebuilt, because the trade of the Coun∣try consisting wholly of Plan∣ters and Merchandizing, the one sort whereof living scatte∣red
<PB REF="10"/>about the Country as Farmers do in <HI>England,</HI> and the other dwelling in the Sea∣port Towns, there is no occasi∣on in the Inland parts for such a Community of Men to dwell together, as that Town would have receiv'd had it continued in its former greatness, yet here are still many Streets, and fair Houses, here is also the seat of the Government; The Go∣vernours House and Chief Courts of Justice, here the As∣sembly met, and here are kept all the Records of the Island.</P>
<P>The chiefest Commodity that this Island makes, is a sort of Muscovadoe Sugar, that ex∣cells any that is made in any other of his Majesties Plantati∣ons, the quantity of which
<PB REF="10"/>increases so much every Year, that it gives Addition to the number of Ships Trading thither; besides this Sugar, there are great quantities of In∣dico, Cotton, Ginger, Tobac∣co, Piemento, Cacaes, Hydes, Achiots, Tortoise-shell, and divers sort of dying, and o∣ther woods, for fine Joyners work, and Cabinets growing there, all which Commodities are as good in their kinds, as are in any Country, and ex∣cepting the Sugar, Indico, Cotten, Ginger and Tobacco, are peculiar to this, and are in no other of His Majesties Plantations; there are also many other accidental Com∣modities brought in from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as Log-wood, Plate,
<PB REF="11"/>Pieces of Eight, Gold, Pearl, E∣meraulds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by means of which Manufactory and Trade, there is not less then 20 Sail of Ships of 300 Tuns a piece Bur∣then, and upwards, besides o∣thers, which only use that Voy∣age, and of all sorts above 100 sail of Ships now laden every Year, and as the Island fills with <HI>English,</HI> and is supplyed with <HI>Negroes,</HI> the Trade and Shipping will both encrease; This Island depends wholly on His Majesty, without any other Proprietors or Compa∣nies, and ever since His Ma∣jesties happy Restoration, he has been graciously pleased it should be Govern'd by a Go∣vernour fully Impowered by His Majesties Commission,
<PB REF="11"/>who has a Council consisting of 13 of the gravest and chief∣est Gentlemen of the Island, to advise with on all occasions, and to them, when it is re∣quisite, there is called an Assem∣bly of Two and thirty of the Gentlemen of the Country, chosen by the Free-holders from among themselves, by vertue of His Majesties writ, which to that end is Issu'd out by the Governour, into the se∣veral Precincts of the Country; These together with the Go∣vernor, and Council make such Laws as are necessary for the well Governing of the I∣sland, and to the making of any Law, there must be the consent of the Governour, Council, and Assembly, as
<PB REF="12"/>three distinct States, of which if any one dissent, no Bill can pass into an Act, so that the making of Laws there, is As∣similated as near as may be, to that of our Native Coun∣try of <HI>England,</HI> and these Laws so made, are of Force at all times, until His Majesty be pleased to declare his pleasure to the contrary, And for the Incouragement of any of His Majesties Subjects to go thi∣ther, with intent to settle and Plant, His Majesty is graci∣ously pleased, to give every Man for himself, Wife, Chil∣dren, and Servants, and all he brings with him (or shall at any time after import) 30 Acres of Land for every head, in any part of the Island, that
<PB REF="12"/>they themselves shall choose, which is not already possest by others, they paying only the common charges of the Sur∣veying and the Patent; and this passes to the Possessor, his Heirs, or Assigns for ever, by his Majesties said Grant, under the great Seal of the Island, in common Soccage, which Patent being enrolled, in the Office for that purpose established there, is good a∣gainst His Majesties claim, or any pretenders whatsoever, though the Patent it self, should happen to be Lost, Burnt, or any otherwise destroyed, the manner of the civil Govern∣ment there is as in <HI>England,</HI> by Sessions of the Peace, Justices, Constables, and o∣ther
<PB REF="13"/>necessary Officers, which are appointed in the several parts of the Country, as there is occasion, that Justice may be equally distributed; And for the Military Government, and defence of the Island, every Man from 16 years old to 60, is obliged (in 6 weeks after arrival with intent to settle there) to list himself in what Company of Foot, or Troop of Horse, he pleases, but ha∣ing listed himself, he is not to remove at his pleasure, except he goes to dwell in some other part of the Country, and then he must list himself in that Regiment, where he goes to reside; Of this Militia (it be∣ing no otherwise) the Gover∣nour is Captain General, who
<PB REF="13"/>is impower'd by his Commis∣sion, to make under him Co∣lonels, Captains, and all other Officers, which Train and Dis∣cipline their respective Soul∣diers, and take care that they keep good Arms, well fixt, and sufficient stores of Ammu∣nition always by them, that so they may be ready on any oc∣casion. The Town of <HI>Port Royal</HI> has in it one intire Regiment of this Militia, consisting of 10 Companies, one of which Companies mounts the Guard successively every night, and keeps Watch in the several Forts, in as good order as is used in any regular Garrison, that is in pay. For the tryal of Titles of Land, decision of controversies, and recovery
<PB REF="14"/>of debts, there are several Courts established, the me∣thods whereof will here fol∣low, written by an ingenious Gentleman, who has been a long Practitioner in the Courts and Laws of that Country, as well as in the Laws of <HI>England.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HIS Majesty having been graciously pleased (with the advice of the Lords of the Privy Council appointed a Committee for Trade and Plan∣tations) to give His Royal As∣sent to several Acts made by the Governour, Council and Assem∣bly of <HI>Jamaica;</HI> it was thought fit to Publish the same, as well for the benefit of its Inhabitants, as all others His Majesties Sub∣jects who may Trade or be any ways concern'd there; but for prevention of Mistakes (lest
<PB REF="15"/>strangers to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> might think these few Acts were all the Laws and Privileges of that Island, which might lessen it in their esteem, and discourage some from adventuring them∣selves or their fortunes thither) I was desired by some Persons of Quality, to give a more particu∣lar account thereof, in observance of whose commands, and respect I bear the place, I promised my endeavours, but must be very brief, for that the Book is in the Press ready to come forth; wherein I may be the more ex∣cusable since a Gentleman who has lived long in, and very well knows that flourishing Country, hath here already given so good a description of the Island which (as he saith) was taken from the
<PB REF="15"/><HI>Spaniards</HI> in the Year 1655, and I may add in the <HI>7th.</HI> year of his now Majesties Reign, who when he came to exercise His Royal Authority was pleased to own what his Subjects had done (which was the same as if he had Commissionated them) and among other his glorious Ti∣tles descended to stile himself Lord of <HI>Jamaica</HI> by whose spe∣cial grace and favour we have hitherto all the Laws and Pri∣viledges of <HI>English</HI> Men exer∣cised and continued amongst us there. These Acts now Printed being only By-Laws for better Government of the Plantation (which in some case requires diffe∣rent Regulations from the King∣dom of <HI>England,</HI> as some Coun∣ties for Stanneries, Fens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB REF="16"/>do here) and for raising such necessary customs as may defray the Publick charge of that Coun∣try, for all Judges and Justices in <HI>Jamaica</HI> determine all Pleas there according to the Laws of <HI>England;</HI> pursuant whereunto that Island hath been Govern'd, except some little Variations for ease and benefit of a new settle∣ment, as our proceedings being all in <HI>English,</HI> our pleading ge∣neral Issues and giving special matters in evidence, our suits being more concise and far less chargeable than in <HI>England,</HI> the Practice of our Courts there much more plain and intelligible. To begin with his Majesties Su∣pream Court of <HI>Judicature</HI> (so called) which hath the same Ju∣risdiction with the <HI>Kings-Bench,
<PB REF="16"/>Common-Pleas, and Exche∣quer</HI> at Westminster, and is held <HI>4</HI> times in the year as the Terms in <HI>England, viz.</HI> every last Tuesday in <HI>February, May, Au∣gust</HI> and <HI>November,</HI> which con∣tinue each time about a Week, and therein are first determin'd all Pleas of the Crown, then follow <HI>Common-Pleas,</HI> &amp;c. The Judges of that Court being Commission'd by his Majesty or his Gover∣nours are always <HI>5</HI> or <HI>7</HI> whereof not less than <HI>3</HI> can try any cause and they consist of the most con∣siderable Gentlemen of the Island both for Parts and Estates, and usually the Chief Justice is one of the best Quality, who hath practised and is well read in the Laws of <HI>England;</HI> tho few of them are so learned as the Judges
<PB REF="17"/>here, yet they are Men of the greatest sense and reason (whereon all Law is or should be grounded) This Court is not Burthen'd with many Officers, for one called the Clerk of the Grand Court is <HI>Prothonotary Custos brevium,</HI> &amp;c. Nor do we trouble our selves with many sorts of Writs, as <HI>Ori∣ginals, Capias, Alias</HI> or <HI>Pluries,</HI> very rarely or never, arresting any Person of known residence, on∣ly send him a Summons to appear next Court, and that he may come provided, a Copy of the De∣claration is always left with the Summons, which being served <HI>8</HI> days at least before the Court, the Defendant is bound to appear, plead, joyn issue, and come to Tryal the very next Court, or Judgment will pass by default,
<PB REF="17"/>no Imparlance being allowed with∣out special cause, as on oath that he hath material Witnesses, and hath endeavoured, but cannot <HI>Subpoena</HI> them. In Tryals we have not several <HI>Venire's</HI> nor a particular Jury for every cause, unless in some special matter of great import, but by a gene∣ral <HI>Venire,</HI> the Marshal pre∣pares enough for four or five setts of Jurors, not knowing what issues they are to Try (which prevents packing or par∣tial returns) who are impannel'd in Court, and put upon the Crown side, or Common Pleas, in such causes as the Judges extempore direct. And the same Jury usually Tries Six or more at a time, as the Court thinks their Memory, may well
<PB REF="18"/>bear, for help whereof some of them take Notes; also they are permitted to take with them the Record it self with all Papers or Deeds proved in Court, most of our actions there being plain matters of Debt or Accompt and some few Ejectments, Writs of Dower, Partition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Ju∣rors indorse their Verdict on each Record which is deliver'd in Court to the Clark, who of course enters Judgment unless it be arrested, which every one may move the last day of the Court, but is rarely granted without very special cause pre∣sently made appear; but if such motions are ever favoured it is in excessive damages on action of Slander or frivolous Tres∣passes which are usually discoun∣tenanced;
<PB REF="18"/>we are not intreagu'd with dilatory Writs of Inquiry, but when any judgment is con∣fess'd or passeth by <HI>nil dicit</HI> in case, &amp;c. the next Jury happen∣ing to be trying issues in Court take the Record and Assess Da∣mages presently. And for ease of those who live by their labour to prevent unnecessary atten∣dance and expences, all Actions depending that Court or Term, are called and tryed alphabeti∣cally beginning with the Plain∣tiffs names; so all parties witnes∣ses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may guess on what day such a letter may come on, and accordingly give their atten∣dance. Fourteen days after the beginning of the Court Execu∣tion issues, for which we have but one Writ comprehending both
<PB REF="19"/>a <HI>Fieri fac</HI> and <HI>Capias ad sat. (viz.)</HI> to levy the Debt and Costs of the Defendants Goods, or if he have none, then, to take his bo∣dy, but because no general Impar∣lance is allowed before, we in a Manner give one after Judg∣ment: For that no man may be ruined by hasty surprise and sale of his goods, the same after sei∣zure in Execution may be retur∣ned, but must be left in the De∣fendants hands to dispose to most advantage (if he end not with the Plaintiff) so as to bring the money into next Court, where∣in if he fails, then a <HI>Venditi∣oni exponas</HI> issues to the Mar∣shal to sell them or any other goods or take his body: Before or after which the Defendant is at liberty to bring his Writ of Er∣ror
<PB REF="19"/>returnable before the Gover∣nour and Council though it is very rarely practised, such Writs meeting with very little encou∣ragement in just Debts. His Majesty hath also constituted in this Island a Court of <HI>Chan∣cery</HI> wherein the Governour him∣self always sits as Chancellour, assisted by several discreet Gen∣tlemen of eminency as Masters, where Causes are speedily deter∣mined without those delays and expences used in <HI>England</HI> There are also in every Parish or County monthly Courts erected for tryal of all Actions under Twenty pounds, or <HI>ad infinitum,</HI> with a <HI>Justicies</HI> out of <HI>Chancery,</HI> which the Governour cautiously grants on special occasions. Of Judg∣ments
<PB REF="20"/>in these Courts Writs of Error lie retornable at the su∣pream Court, but rarely brought for reason aforesaid. Then eve∣ry Justice of Peace (besides the authority of a Justice in <HI>England</HI>) hath power of hol∣ding a Court of Conscience for all matters not exceeding Fourty shillings value. The Quarter Sessions are also held in each Pa∣rish or County after the manner of <HI>England,</HI> and there is a Court of Admiralty at the Town of <HI>Port Royal</HI> for tryal of Piracy and deciding other Maritime af∣fairs, from whence we have the liberty of appealing to the Governour there, or to his Majesty in Council here for redress. The Governour al∣so
<PB REF="20"/>hath power (as Ordinary of the Diocess) for <HI>probate</HI> of Wills, granting Administrations and determining all controversies concerning the same; But Ec∣clesiastical or Spiritual Courts are not yet known in this I∣sland, Nor are Purchasers here incumbred with bad Titles for that Register (so much wished for in <HI>England</HI>) is here establish∣ed where all Conveyances being acknowledged are to be enroll'd within three months, if the Cog∣nisors inhabit there; But if any persons Feme Coverts or others residing in <HI>England,</HI> and inte∣rested in any Lands or Planta∣tions there shall desire to dis∣pose of the same here, they must seal and deliver their deeds be∣fore two or more credible Per∣sons
<PB REF="21"/>going for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> who at∣testing the same before a Judge there, the same may be enrolled in Six months, and shall be as <HI>valid</HI> in Law, as if done by Fine, Recovery or otherwise. In which case I should advise the Purchaser to take by way of Lease and Release, and to have two parts at least of each, with Covenants for further assurance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that if one part happen to miscarry, he may require ano∣ther, yet so as always to keep one here, lest any breach of Cove∣nants should happen. And since this publick Register or Office of Enrolments is found of such ge∣neral use, that no Purchaser or Lender of money can be decei∣ved in his Title, it may not be unseasonable (for advancement
<PB REF="21"/>of our Plantation Trade, and consequently enriching our na∣tive Country of <HI>England,</HI> the great Receptacle of all our wealth) to encourage monied men (who expose it here at <HI>4,</HI> and <HI>5. per cent.</HI> yet cannot get satisfactory security) to adven∣ture some of it for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where they may have unquestio∣nable security, by men of visible estates, or good Mortgages, for neither Persons nor Estates can be there incumbred, but they must be discover'd either by the afore∣said Register or report of their Neighbours, who generally more intimately know and better ob∣serve each others Affairs than they can in <HI>England.</HI> Nor was it ever known that any Mortgage hath been defeated or Title pro∣ved
<PB REF="22"/>defective where compared and agreeing with the Register, so that any Persons having mo∣nies here to put out, may remit the same to <HI>Jamaica</HI> by Bills of of Exchange at <HI>20 per cent.</HI> or in Commodities (by advice of Merchants here) at <HI>40,</HI> or <HI>50 per cent.</HI> or more advance, and lend the same at <HI>10 per cent.</HI> running only (in Commodi∣ties) the risque of the Sea which also is so inconsiderable, that it may be ensured for about <HI>2 per cent.</HI> But when they recal their moneys they may expect <HI>15,</HI> or <HI>20 per cent.</HI> loss on their returns though sometimes they gain also back which loss when it happens may be attributed to the difference of our Coyns here and there, <HI>Jamaica</HI> money being
<PB REF="22"/>about ⅕ more in value there than it will yield in <HI>England.</HI> And such Adventurers have this fur∣ther encouragement, that all real Securities there are <HI>meliorated</HI> (being certainly emprovable) the longer they continue planted, whereas lands here usually de∣crease in value. It might also turn to much greater advantage then the best way of employing money in <HI>England</HI> To purchase Plantations there, many good penniworths frequently offering, as may be found by inquiry here of such as have estates there, though usually those that have least do most undervalue the place: For if <HI>Jamaica</HI> lie under any ill character she owes it to some few Prodigals who having Riotously consumed that little
<PB REF="23"/>they carried thither, and being through ignorance or laziness in∣capable of any imploy, come home and rail against the Country, to justifie their unprofitable voyage and return. There is also ano∣ther imputation on <HI>Jamaica,</HI> viz. the difficulty of getting due returns and recovery of just Debts. To the first it hath usu∣ally more noise than substance, for many men of declining fortunes, to deceive their Creditors, or otherwise, boast of great concerns there, and disappointments by their Factors and Agents, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> when really they have little or nothing in the Island, for if they had, the Law is open and much more cheap and expeditious re∣medies to be used there than in <HI>England,</HI> though indeed as to
<PB REF="23"/>the second some have herein met with obstructions partly occasio∣ned by a former Law indulging all new Comers for <HI>5</HI> years a∣gainst prosecutions for forreign Debts: But that being now thought a disparagement to so po∣pulous and opulent a Colony, was dislik't by the Lords Committees and is not confirmed: Other inconveniencies some have met with for want of due infor∣mation how to draw their proofs an procurations: I would not encourage any litigious suits, but for instruction of honest Cre∣ditors against able Debtors, I should prescribe this method, that all Letters of Attorny be Attest∣ed by Persons going thither, who may prove the same <HI>vivâ voce,</HI> which being recorded there, is
<PB REF="24"/>good though the witnesses die or return, whereas Persons usually send procurations under Corpo∣ration seals which are not there admitted for that better proofs may be easily had as aforesaid; But such cannot always be found for Debt: In such case the Law there is so favourable to admit depositions attested under the seal of the City of <HI>London</HI> or other Corporations, but then the Plaintiff would do well to give due credit on Oath for what he hath received, or else the De∣fendant may have just occasion (with security) to delay him by Injunction till he answer his Bill in <HI>Chancery:</HI> Or if the Debt accrews by <HI>Specialtie,</HI> the Ori∣ginal bond it self must go over, it being unreasonable to recover
<PB REF="24"/>against any man on a Copy, yet the Bond it self lie out against him; nor can indorsments nor truth so well appear unless pro∣duced in Court. If any Bill of exchange be drawn from <HI>Jamai∣ca</HI> which will not be paid here, one of the original Bills must go back doubly protested as well for <HI>non acceptance</HI> as for <HI>non pay∣ment,</HI> and in mistaking these or such like measures (grounded upon Law and Reason) many have been baffled or delayed and then causlesly reflect on the Ju∣stice of the Island. This is what occurs at present about our Temporal Laws. I may also add that the People are gene∣rally of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and I am confident, in no part of the Kings Dominions hath his
<PB REF="25"/>Majesty more truly Loyal Sub∣jects for the number of its Inhabi∣tants, than are in <HI>Jamaica:</HI> We have very few Papists or Secta∣ries, for neither Jesuits or Non∣conformist Parsons do or can live among us; some few have at∣tempted, but never could gain Proselytes enough to afford them sustenance (though all except Pa∣pists may freely exercise what Re∣ligion they please without distur∣bance) But for able orthodox Di∣vines there is so great encourage∣ment that it's to be admired so many can content themselves with such mean or no Benefices in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> when they may so comfor∣tably subsist in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> for that they are certainly provided for by an Act intituled, <HI>For Mainte∣nance of Ministers,</HI> which see in
<PB REF="25"/>this Book <HI>Folio 124.</HI> Besides which allowances, in most Pa∣rishes the Contingencies by vo∣luntary presents for Christenings, Marriages, Buryings, and o∣therwise with Houses taking Boarders, Schooling, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> make considerable additions. So that they may live comfortably and lay up; Victuals being as plen∣tiful and of the same sorts for Butchers meat, tame and wild Fowl, Fish, Bread, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (with more variety) as in <HI>England,</HI> with this difference that we have green Peas, Beans, Cherries, Asparagus, Musk and water Mel∣lons, Pines, Grapes, Oranges, Pomgranats, Citrons, Lemons and hundreds of several other sorts of Fruits in season all the year long. But some are apt to
<PB REF="26"/>object the hazard of the Voyage, and unhealthiness of the place; as to the first, It's as safe going to <HI>Jamaica</HI> as to go in a Wherry on the River <HI>Thames,</HI> where more Boats are cast away in proportion than Ships going for that Island, for we soon come into a trade Wind and presently sail be∣fore it, almost constantly blow∣ing from East to West, that is from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Jamaica.</HI> It being rarely known that any Ves∣sels miscarry going thither. And this is evident enough if we con∣sider the common rate of Ensu∣rers at two <HI>per cent.</HI> who are men of foresight and experience never proposing less then doub∣ling their money which they can∣not do if but one Ship in an hun∣dred miscarry, yet that doth not
<PB REF="26"/>happen in time of Peace. Then as to the unhealthiness of the Climate, (there are some who never were abroad think all places beyond Sea much alike, so that having heard of sickness and seasonings for new comers in places lately setled they are apt to impute it without any reason to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> the Air being always serene and weather constantly temperate, though usually re∣puted very hot, yet it's only so comparatively in respect of these Northern Climates, being with us always Summer as if every Month were <HI>June.</HI> I have ob∣served and can experimentally affirm for Twelve years last past <HI>Jamaica</HI> to be as healthful a place as any part of <HI>England,</HI> for sober temperate persons, who
<PB REF="27"/>have command of themselves, e∣specially at first arrival, and can moderately drink one third Wine with two thirds Water, but one the other side I think it as pernicious a place to debauch in, as any in the World, and this so necessary vertue of sobriety be∣ing more habitual in the other Sex, makes the place far less fatal to them then men, whereof usually ten dye in proportion for one Woman, as appears by the yearly Bills of Mortality on <HI>Port Royal</HI> (which is the <HI>London</HI> of <HI>Jamaica</HI>) and it is not ex∣traordinary, if we also consider the nature of the Climate (as it really is,) most propitious to Child-bearing Women who are not so subject to Miscarriages, Distem∣pers, Pains or Difficulties before,
<PB REF="27"/>at or after Delivery, as they are in <HI>England,</HI> for being always Sum∣mer, there is no danger of catch∣ing colds, nor need of Fires in their Chambers, no Rooms there having any Chimnies except the Kitchen which is usually apart from the dwelling house. In <HI>Jamaica</HI> the Women after Child∣bed are strong and lusty at three days end, and about House again in a week; nay some <HI>Negro</HI> Women are at work in the Field the same or next day. I have been often questioned about the Natives of our Island whether they were not a terror to us, <HI>&amp;c</HI> It may not therefore be imper∣tinent to declare that <HI>Jamaica</HI> is wholly Inhabited with <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> who found none there but <HI>Spaniards,</HI> which were soon
<PB REF="28"/>beaten off, and are long since in battel or by flight extirpated, though perhaps it was formerly very populous with <HI>Indians,</HI> but those were destroyed by the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI> so that we have no Na∣tives at present but Chil∣dren of the <HI>English,</HI> or their <HI>Negro</HI> Slaves (which are im∣ported thither as Merchandize from <HI>Guiney</HI> and other parts of <HI>Africa</HI>) of whom we are in no such fear or danger as in lesser Islands. But <HI>Jamaica</HI> is of too vast an extent for any such surprize, being in many places divided with mountains of dif∣ficult access, and great Rivers not passable but by Boats or Ferries, which dare carry no <HI>Ne∣groes</HI> without a written Tick∣et or Licence from their Master
<PB REF="28"/>or Overseer. And if any Slave be found wandring out of his Masters Plantation any person may seize and carry him to his Owner or next Of∣ficer and receive a certain reward. By which and other expedient me∣thods, it's safer living or travelling in <HI>Jamaica</HI> than <HI>England,</HI> we having rarely any House-breaking or Robbery, for want of receivers, most persons there generally knowing each other as they do in Country Cities here, though there are few Inns for Travel∣lers, yet they are better and cheaper accommodated at Planter Houses, who are generally very Hospitable and are conveniently dispersed over the whole Island, for all <HI>Jamaica</HI> is set∣led by the <HI>English</HI> from one end to the other, though in some places more thin than others. The Houses indeed are not so close as in some parts of <HI>England,</HI> yet usually the Planta∣tions are contiguous, for a great Sugar work requires some hundreds of Acres for Canes, Wood, Provisions, Pasture, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet most of the Planters, are
<PB REF="29"/>forward enough to spare some of it to a good Neighbour on reasonable terms. The Wood-lands are common∣ly cleared and used for Planting, but there are vast even Meadows called <HI>Savannas,</HI> for grazing of Horses, Cattel, Sheep, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which we never cut nor make any Hay of, having Grass all the year long, though some∣times a little too much dryed or scorched by the Sun, when many pur∣posely set it one Fire, the ashes whereof mannure and emprove the Ground against another Crop, which will suddenly spring again with the next gentle showers or without, by the great dews which there fall in the night, and in the mean time the Cattle retire to other pastures in shady Woods or lower Marshes; it is also observable that our Horses are generally swift, but few or none of them shod, yet will gallop the most stony way, and climb steep Rocks like Goats, nor are they troubled with near so many distempers as Horses in <HI>England,</HI> it being common (though
<PB REF="29"/>never so hot or hard ridden) to turn them presently grazing, but the Horses are usually of so small a breed that all Gentlemens Coaches (which are there very numerous) go with six Horses a piece, we have also se∣veral Hackney-Coaches. The man∣ner of living there for gallantry, good Housekeeping and Recreations (as Horse-Races, Bowls, Dancing, Musick, Plays at a publick Theatre, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) sufficiently demonstrate the flourishing condition of the Island, yearly increasing as well in number of Inhabitants as in wealth and plen∣ty, being most commodiously seated in the midst of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> so that we drain the benefits of their Gold and Silver Mines without their Labour and expences. The Town of <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> being as it were the Store∣house or Treasury of the <HI>West-Indies.</HI> is always like a continual Mart or Fair where all sorts of choice Merchandizes are daily imported not only to furnish the Island, but vast quantities are thence again Transported to supply
<PB REF="30"/>the <HI>Spaniards, Indians,</HI> and other Nations, who in exchange return us bars and cakes of Gold, wedges and piggs of Silver, Pistols, Pieces of Eight, and several other Coyns of both Mettles, with store of wrought Plate, Jewels, rich Pearl Necklaces, and of Pearl unsorted or undrill'd several Bushels; besides which, we are furnished with the purest and most fine sorts of dust Gold from <HI>Gui∣ney,</HI> by the <HI>Negro</HI> Ships, who first come to <HI>Jamaica</HI> to deliver their Blacks, and there usually refit and stay to reload three or four Months, in which time (though the Companies Gold may be partly sent home) yet the Merchants, Masters of Ships, and almost every Mariner (having pri∣vate Cargoes) take occasion to sell or exchange great quantities; some of which our Goldsmiths there work up (who being yet but few) grow very wealthy, for almost every House hath a rich Cupboard of Plate which they carelesly expose, scarce shutting their doors in the night, being in no
<PB REF="30"/>apprehension of Thieves for want of Receivers as aforesaid. And where∣as most other Plantations ever did and now do keep their accounts in Sugar, or the proper Commodities of the place, for want of Money, it is otherwise in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> for in <HI>Port Royal</HI> there is more plenty of run∣ning Cash (Proportionally to the number of its Inhabitants than is in <HI>London,</HI> which (among other wor∣thy Acts) we chiefly owe to the pro∣vident care of his excellency Sir <HI>Thomas Lynch</HI> our present and for∣mer Governour, who about Ten years ago (by advice of his Majesties Council there) raised the value of our current Coyns about ⅕ more than they will yield in any other part of Christendom, so that none care to car∣ry Money off but bring great quantities thither, which occasions the daily in∣crease of our Sugar works and other profitable Plantations, and gives great incouragement to the Gentle∣men Planters in other adjacent Islands and Plantatione to remove
<PB REF="31"/>and settle amongst us, being there obliged to use trash, and Sea-Coals to boyl their Sugar (which renders it not so good as when made with quick wood fires;) nor are they here at so great charge for Horses and Cattle to do their work, nor pent up in such narrow Plantations for want of Land as in those small Islands, nor subject to many other incon∣veniencies incident to little Coun∣tries and small numbers of People. This Island of <HI>Jamaica</HI> being very Capacious, and supply'd both from abroad and in it self with great Plenty of all things necessary.</P>
