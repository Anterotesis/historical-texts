<P>IT is not a thirst of empty glory that makes me runne hazard of your censure, but a consideration of the weaknesse of School▪ masters, who undertake to read the Greek Orators to raw Schollers, themselves being not ripe in the <HI>Attick</HI> customes. <HI>I</HI> have therefore so far endeavoured as you see.

<P>THe ancients had but three sorts of government. <HI>Tyran∣nis, Democratia Oligarchia</HI> as <NOTE PLACE="marg">In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> p. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Aeschines,</HI> which <HI>Polybius</HI> cals <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. where although the one names it a <HI>Tyrannis</HI> or Tyranny, the other <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the rule of a King, yet must we understand the same.
