<HEAD>TO THE
NOBILITY, GEN∣TRY
and COMMONALTY
OF
KENT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Honourable, &amp;c.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>Ou are now presented with my
larger Survey of <HI>Kent</HI> (pro∣mised
in my Epistle to my
late brief Survey of the same)
wherein (among severall
things) (I hope conducible
to the service of that Coun∣ty)
you will finde mention
of some memorable acts done, and offices of emi∣nent
<PB REF="3"/>
trust borne, by severall of your Ancestors,
other remarkeable matters touching them, and
the Places of Habitation, and Interment of ma∣ny
of them. For the ready finding whereof, I
have added an Alphabeticall Table at the end of
this Tract. My Obligation of Gratitude to that
County (wherein I have had a comfortable sub∣sistence
for above Thirty five years last past,
and for some of them had the Honour to serve
the same) pressed me to this Taske (which be∣ing
finished) If it (in any sort) prove servicea∣ble
thereunto, I have what I aimed at; My
humble request is; That if herein any thing
be found (either by omission or alteration)
substantially or otherwise different from my a∣foresaid
former Survey, you would be pleased
to be informed, that the same happened by
reason of further or better information (tend∣ing
to more certaine truths) than formerly I had.
Those differencies, and the rectifying of the
same, are contained in a parcell of this Tract
(towards the end thereof) which I now added;
That thereby Correction may be made of my for∣mer
Survey, which will be more conveniently
portable (for ordinary use) than this. What
is found defective herein, be pleased not to im∣pute
to wilfull errour; But either to misappre∣hension,
or misinformation (both which I en∣deavoured
to avoid) And as to the distances of
Parishes (herein specified) be pleased to know
<PB REF="3"/>
that I meane the same by a straight line from
Church to Church, taking the Station for the
view at <HI>Newenden,</HI> being the middle of the
South-side of the County, as they stand in
that best Map thereof extant, made by Ma∣ster
<HI>Phillip Symonson</HI> (sometime Resident there∣in)
which I the rather doubt not to call the best
for that (by comparing the same with o∣thers)
I finde it so to be; and the like Cha∣racter
(in effect) was long since set upon the
same, by that Learned, Judicious and Laborious
Gentleman, <HI>William Lambard,</HI> Esquire, whose
Monument of Piety and Charity, in this County
Directory to the peaceable Government of
the same, and painfull and able performance of
his <HI>Perambulation</HI> thereof, have rendred and will
perpetuate his Memory Famous. The last
whereof hath left very little matter of addition
(but much of imitation) both for my self, and all
others that shall succeed him in works of this
nature, which was the principall cause that I
endeavoured brevity herein, being unwilling
too far to lengthen this Tract with repetition of
what hath been better set forth by others,
though in works of this nature all ingenuous
persons know, much use must be made of the la∣bours
of our Predecessors. (There being no o∣ther
way to enable treating of matters long be∣fore
our being) Now that the Errata's of the
Presse may first be corrected by what is at the end
<PB REF="4"/>
of this Tract (for that purpose) prepared, before
the Tract be read, and that (in reading the same)
other smaller errours of the Presse may also be
corrected, and that the passages herein may be
well weighed, before censured, and the veile of
love cast over what is (either in truth or in the
Readers conceit) defective, or mistaken, is the
humble desire of.</P>

<HEAD>A
TOPOGRAPHIE:
OR,
Survey of the County of
KENT.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His County of <HI>Kent</HI> is scituate at
the South East part or corner of
<HI>England,</HI> and is bounded to the
River of <HI>Thames</HI> towards the
North, to the <HI>German</HI> Ocean to∣wards
the North and East, to
the narrow Seas toward the
East and South, to the County
of <HI>Sussex</HI> towards the South and
West, and to the County of <HI>Surrey</HI> towards the West.</P>
<P>The length thereof (in a straight line) from the West
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
part of <HI>Leusham</HI> to the East part of Saint <HI>Peters</HI> in <HI>Thonet</HI>
is about 52. miles. But in the middle length thereof from
the West part of <HI>Bra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed</HI> to the East part of <HI>Ringwold;</HI> it is
but about 47. miles.</P>
<P>And through the middle of this County from <HI>Newen∣den-Bridge</HI>
in the South, to the furthest part of the <HI>Isle</HI> of
<HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ean</HI> in the North, the breadth is about 27. miles.</P>
<P>The circumserence of the County is thus, <HI>viz.</HI> from
the West and of <HI>Dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ford,</HI> to the East end of the North
Foreland in the <HI>Isle</HI> of <HI>Thanet,</HI> (round by the river of
Thames and the Sea) (being the North side of the Coun∣ty)
is about 61. miles, but in a straight line, the same is
but about 51: miles.</P>
<P>From thence about to the corner of <HI>Dengenesse</HI> (being
the East side) is about 38. miles, But (in a straight line)
the same is but about 31. miles.</P>
<P>From t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence about to th' end of <HI>Cowden</HI> (being the
south side) is about 39. miles, but in a straight line, it is
but about 33. miles.</P>
<P>And from thence about to the aforesaid end of <HI>Dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ford</HI>
(being the west side) is about 24. miles, but in a
straight line the same is but about 21. miles.</P>
<P>So the whole circum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erence (round about this Coun∣ty)
is about 162. miles, but in the straight lines aforesaid,
the same is but about 136. miles.</P>
<P>I finde severall derivations of the names of this Coun∣ty,
<HI>viz.</HI> of the antient name <HI>Cantium,</HI> and the now name
<HI>Kent,</HI> but (with submission to better judgments) I ra∣ther
adhere to their opinion, that conceive the names to
be derived from the scituation of the place <HI>(viz.</HI> in a
nook or corner of <HI>England,</HI> antiently called a <HI>Kant</HI> or
<HI>Gantel.)</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants of this County were sometimes cal∣led
<HI>Eskins,</HI> which name arose by <HI>Eske</HI> (second King of
<HI>Kent</HI>) raigning over them many yeers, but (his memory
vanishing) the name also vanished.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="6"/>The aire of this County (other than the weald, and
the marshes and places adiacent thereunto) is accounted
very healthy; but the marshes, for the most part unheal∣thy,
and the weald, and places adjoyning to the marshes
not generally so healthy as the most part of the rest of the
County.</P>
<P>The commodious scituation of this County may justly
compare with (if not exceed) any other part of the Na∣tion
(the same being scituate neer) (but some little
distance from) <HI>London</HI> (the chief City) and the Thames
(that Soveraign River of <HI>Britaine</HI>) watering the North
side thereof about 33. miles in length: The <HI>German</HI> and
narrow Seas, watering the North East, and South sides
thereof about 73. miles in length, and the River of <HI>Ro∣ther</HI>
likewise watering the South side thereof about 11.
miles in length.</P>
<P>It also having severall good rivers and rivule<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in the
bowels of the same, and more especially (towards the
West parts thereof) <HI>Ravensborne</HI> watering the same 9.
miles, <HI>Cray</HI> 8. miles, and <HI>Darent</HI> 16. miles; famous <HI>Med∣way</HI>
towards the middle (spreading it self into severall
branches) watereth the same about 85. miles, and
<HI>Stoure</HI> towards the East parts thereof (likewise spread∣ing
it self into severall branches) watereth the same a∣bout
60. miles; By which Rivers most of the most emi∣nent
places of this County are watered, and navigation
maintained to the principall of them.</P>
<P>How far this County is otherwise equall to (if not
excelling) any other County of this Nation, I shall offer
to the Readers judgement these considerations.</P>
<P>First, Concerning Religion, I know that <HI>Glastenbury</HI>
in the County of <HI>Somerset</HI> doth pretend (and not pretend
only) that about the 31<SUP>th</SUP>. year after the death of Christ,
12. of the Disciples of the Apostle <HI>Philip</HI> (of which <HI>Ioseph</HI>
of <HI>Arimathea</HI> was cheif) came into this Nation, and ten∣dred
the knowledge of Christian Religion to <HI>Arviragus</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
then King thereof) (which though he consented not to
embrace) yet he permitted them to have a Church at this
<HI>Glastenbury,</HI> and there began the plantation of Christian
Religion in this land (which being admitted) yet it like∣wise
appeareth▪ That (for many years) the same had but
little successe of en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ale and no King of this Nation em∣braced
the same, till King <HI>Lucius</HI> (who raigned about
150. years afterwards, and built a Church in <HI>Dover Ca∣stle</HI>
in this County, for the exercise of Christian Religion,
from whence may be inferred, that that Religion was
the embraced here, But most part of the Nation revolt∣ing
f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om that Religion, and becoming Pagans till the
year 596. (In the time of the <HI>Heptarchy) Augustine</HI> the
Monk was sent from Pope <HI>Gregory,</HI> to convert this Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion
to the Christian faith, and first landed in this County, and
converted and baptised many of the people of the same,
and likewise converted <HI>Ethelbert,</HI> (then King thereof)
who upon <HI>Whitsunday</HI> in the year 597. was by him here
baptised, was the first Christian <HI>Saxon</HI> King, and this
County was the first County that generally received the
Christian faith; afterwards <HI>Edwin</HI> (King of the <HI>Northum∣bers</HI>
Marrying from hence <HI>Edelburg</HI> (Daughter of the said
King <HI>Ethelbert) Paulinus</HI> (afterwards Bishop of <HI>Rochester</HI>)
went from hence with her into her husbands Kingdome
(for the conversion of the people thereof) where in some
part he prevailed, but in the year 633. (<HI>Edwin</HI> being slain)
that people revolted from that Religion, and <HI>Paulinus</HI>
was forced to returne again hither, and Christian Religion
was again (as it were) confined to this County, Nor were
succession of Christian Bishops in this Nation (other than
of <HI>Canterbury</HI> and <HI>Rochester</HI> (both in this County) for
many years afterwards, and instrumentally from thence
sprang the after-conversion of the rest of the Nation to the
Christian faith; But the cōversion of the West <HI>Saxons</HI> (with
in whose Dominion <HI>Glastenbury</HI> was) was not till about
40. years after the conversion of this County (At which
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
time <HI>Kingils</HI> their King was converted and baptised by
<HI>Byrinus</HI> an <HI>Italian</HI> Bishop.</P>
<P>This County (as before appeareth) had in it two
Bishops Seas (one whereof, <HI>viz. Canterbury,</HI> was the Pri∣mate
and Metropolitan of all <HI>England:</HI> And his Church
very anciently called the Nurse and Metropolis of
the same) By which, and by what is hereafter said, may
be collected th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the rise of that common proverbe <HI>(Kent
and Christendome)</HI> was not (as vulgarly mistaken) that
<HI>Kent</HI> was conceived diffinct from Christendome, but that
it was famous as <HI>Kent,</HI> and famous as Christendome.</P>
<P>Secondly, Concerning the ancient dignity and con∣siderableness
of this County: In the time of <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI>
(about 1700. years since) it was in Four petty King∣domes,
governed by Four Kings (viz. <HI>Cingetorix, Cavi∣lius,
Taximagulus,</HI> and <HI>Segonax.</HI>)</P>
<P>Afterwards King <HI>Vortigern</HI> (about 1200. years since)
set over the same a Guorong or Vice-Roy.</P>
<P>Afterwards, this was the first of the Kingdomes of the
Heptarchy, and no one County of <HI>England</HI> had a King of
it self but this (whose Kingdome began about the year
455. and continued about 372. years, in the succession
of 17. Kings.)</P>
<P>By that learned Antiquary Mr. <HI>Camden,</HI> it is called the
key of <HI>England,</HI> and in it is Four of the Cinque portes of
this Nation (viz. <HI>Sandwich, Dover, New Romney,</HI> and
<HI>Hith</HI>) as also that famous Castle of <HI>Dover,</HI> the confide∣rableness
whereof <HI>Phillip</HI> King of <HI>France</HI> well weighing,
when (in the time of King <HI>Hen. 3.) Lewes</HI> his son, had
took divers townes and fortes in <HI>England,</HI> and hearing
that he could not take this Castle (the same being vali∣antly
defended by <HI>Hubert de Burgh</HI>) protested that then
his son had not one foot of land in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, The civility of the people (still treading
in the steps of their Ancestors) who in the time of the
aforesaid <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> were by him accounted, and so
stiled, the most civilized people of all this Nation:</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8"/>Fourthly, For the ancient valour of the people of this
County, they claime, and are allowed the front in Bat∣tailes.
And they onely of all <HI>England</HI> obteyned and re∣teyne
the name of <HI>VNCONQVERED:</HI> For (as if
all the antient English valour were remaining in them)
they only resisted King <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, (when
all other Counties submitted) and (capl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulating with
him) reserved to themselves and their posterity, their anti∣ent
Customes and Liberties.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Which is the next confideration offered, <HI>viz.</HI>
Generally the tenures of the lands in this County, are (if
not the freest) yet as free tenures as any in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Sixthly, The royal Navy usually riding in the <HI>Downes</HI>
of this County, in which County also are those three fa∣mous
Shipdocks of <HI>Deptford, Woolwich,</HI> and <HI>Chetham;</HI> in
the two first whereof, the principall part of the Royall
Navy is usually repaired, and in the last, the same is usu∣ally
also repaired, and laid up.</P>
<P>Seventhly, Four houses lately belonging to the Kings
of <HI>England,</HI> viz. <HI>East Greenwich, Eltham, Otford,</HI> and
<HI>Dartford.</HI></P>
<P>Eighthly, The severall good commodities for the use
of man, with which it is richly furnished and famous for,
<HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>1. Plenty of Fowl and Fish of all sorts (by advantage
of the aforesaid Seas and fresh Rivers.)</P>
<P>2. Fertil lands, for feeding cattle of all sorts (and
more especially those famous levels of <HI>Romney,</HI> and <HI>Wal∣land</HI>
Marsh.)</P>
<P>3. The Drapery of this County, which hath here con∣tinued
for above three hundred and twenty years; to∣wards
which the bowels of this County are well stored
with Fullers earth, and many fulling mills not far distant
from the same.</P>
<P>4. The Fruit (plentifully sent from hence to the
chief City, <HI>London,</HI> and places adjacent.)</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8"/>5. The great plenty of grain (of all sorts) growing
therein, and more especially in the North, and East parts
of the same.</P>
<P>6. The Plenty of wood, but more especially in the
Weald, wherein also are many Iron mills, floring with
Iron <HI>London,</HI> and the other places adjacent</P>
<P>Some Chronologers affirm that King <HI>Alfred</HI> divided
this Nation (and among the rest this part thereof) into
Shires, Counties, or Provinces; but that is controverted
by others, and alledged that it was so divided short∣ly
after the inhabiting of this Island, and in the tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of
the time of King <HI>Ina</HI> (which was above 180. years be∣fore
King <HI>Alsred</HI>) there is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ntion of Shires, and so that
of King <HI>Alfred</HI> may (as to this purpose) be only some
plaine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ription of the former division; And for this

this Town, and of the Churches, and old Religious Hou∣ses
therein; and of the Castle lying above the same; I
had thoughts of forbearing inlargement thereupon; yet
(for that I find not severall things touching the same,
there fully set down, &amp; find also some other things omit∣ted)
I shall therefore therein give the Reader some further
account.</P>
<P>And first touching that which is of most dignity (the
Castle) The same in the time of <HI>Cassibelanus,</HI> Governour
of <HI>Britain</HI> (about 1700. years since) was (by the com∣mand
of <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI>) built according to the <HI>Romane</HI> or∣der
(to keep the <HI>Britains</HI> in subjection) and thereupon
was called <HI>Caesars</HI> Castle, and the <HI>Romans</HI> Court, and so
continued for about 80. years; at which time (the same
being in decay) <HI>Arviragus</HI> (King of <HI>Britain</HI>) having posses∣sed
it, reedified &amp; inlarged the same, &amp; fortified it against
the Romanes (calling it <HI>Ledonnegio</HI>) and he stopped the an∣tient
Haven (whereby the name of the place was after∣wards
called <HI>De à Fore,</HI> or stopt before, or stop out;
and since (by contraction) <HI>Dovor;</HI> yet I finde by others
the name to be derived from the <HI>British</HI> word <HI>Dufyrr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ae</HI>
(signifying a place steep and upright) as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cituation of
the same is) and by others, <HI>Dur</HI> or <HI>Dour</HI> the common
name (among the <HI>Britains</HI>) for all Waters (touching
which, I leave the Reader to his election.)</P>
<P>This Castle after falling to decay, was repaired by
<HI>Withred</HI> King of <HI>Kent</HI> (about 950. years since) and at the
coming in of King <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour was (on the
behalf of King <HI>Harold</HI>) kept against him by <HI>Stephen Ash∣borneham</HI>
(a Baron) and <HI>Alan</HI> of <HI>Evering</HI> his Lieurenant,
but (the same being taken by the Conquerour) they
were both beheaded, and afterwards that King made
<HI>Iohn</HI> Lord <HI>Fynes</HI> (his kinsman) Constable thereof by in∣heritance,
<PB N="80" REF="45"/>
gave him very many Knights fees, for his bet∣ter
mainteyning of the same, and the said Constable af∣terwards
made the work on the hanger of the hill there,
and also made eight chief Captains or Lieutenant Go∣vernours
of this Castle whose names do follow) and to
them such Knights fees were assigned, and for the same
they warded in this Castle yearly as followeth, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Albrance,</HI> otherwise <HI>Albrank</HI> had one and
twenty Knights fees, and warded twenty eight weeks.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Arsick</HI> had eighteen Knights fees, and
warded twenty four weeks.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Fulbert</HI> of <HI>Dovor</HI> had fifteen Knights fees, and war∣ded
twenty weeks.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Iefferey Peverell</HI> had fourteen Knights fees, and war∣ded
twenty weeks.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William Mamouth</HI> had twenty foure Knights fees,
and warded thirty two weeks.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Robert Porth</HI> had twelve Knights fees, and warded
twenty four weeks.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Hugh Crevequer</HI> had five Knights fees, and warded
twenty foure weeks.</P>
<P>And Sir <HI>Adam Fitzwilllams</HI> had six Knights fees, and
warded twenty four weeks.</P>
<P>And by this means there were alwayes 1000. men in
the same for the Guard thereof (which Guard was so kept
for fear of the <HI>Danes,</HI> and by reason of the distrust which
that King had of the men of this County) and these Cap∣tains
built and repaired their severall Towers in this
Castle.</P>
<P>King <HI>Iohn</HI> afterwards recompenced the heire of <HI>Fynes</HI>
for the same, and took it into his hands, and afterwards
(in the time of King <HI>Hen.</HI> 3.) this personall service of
Castle-guard was turned into a contributory payment of
money (towards guarding the Castle) and sworne War∣ders
were appointed for that service, and in those dayes
there belonged to the same many Souldiers (both Horse
<PB N="81" REF="45"/>
and foot) and therefore the Arches, Vaults, and Barbi∣cans
were made there for them to issue out at.</P>
<P>This Castle afterwards fell again to decay, but (in the
times of King <HI>Hen.</HI> 4. King <HI>Edw.</HI> 4. and Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>)
much cost was bestowed in repair thereof (and more es∣pecially
in the time of King <HI>Edw.</HI> 4.</P>
<P>In the same is a Church, founded by King <HI>Lucius</HI> (o∣therwise
<HI>Lucius Coilus</HI>) above 1400 years since, in which
Sir <HI>Robert Asheton</HI> (who was a person of great honour,
Constable of this Castle, and gave the best Bell of that
Church to the same) was above 270. years since inter∣red,
as was also <HI>Henry</HI> Earle of <HI>Northampton</HI> (Lord War∣den
of the Cinque Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts above forty years since.)</P>
<P>In this Castle were also antiently two Chappels, a
Colledge of Chanons, severall streets of houses and
Markets kept.</P>
<P>The Colledge aforesaid is said to have been begun in
the time of the said King <HI>Lucius,</HI> but more certain it is
that <HI>Eadbald</HI> (King of Kent) erected the same, and it
was afterwards removed from thence by King <HI>Withred</HI>
into the Towne,</P>
<P>There were antiently in this Castle a Commissary
(who held his Court there) and these other Officers, <HI>viz.</HI>
a Lieutenant, Marshall, learned Steward, Clerke of the
Exche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quer, Gentleman Porter, four Yeomen Porters, a
Serjant at armes, <HI>Boder,</HI> Serjant of the Admiralty (be∣ing
antiently the Marshal's Deputy) Serjants to arrest,
a Serjant of the Artillery, a Serjant to serve process from
the Castle-gate Court, an Armorer, Smith, Plummer,
Carpenter, two Warrenners, and a Priest (whose house
there was called <HI>Cocklecoe</HI>) all which had particular sa∣laries,
and in the same also was an Exchecquer Office.</P>
<P>In this Castle likewise antiently was to be seen, a Tow∣er
(called <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Tower) afterwards the Kings lodg∣ings
(excellent for workmanship, and very high) a spa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious

or entry, great Pipes and Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kes (bound with iron
hoopes) wherein was liquor (supposed to be wine)
which by long lying became as thick as Treackle, and
would cleave like Bird-lime; Salt congealed together
as hard as stone, Cross-Bowes, long Bowes, and Arrowes
to the same (to which was fastened Brass in stead of fea∣thers)
and the same were of such bigness, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not fit to be
used by any men of this or late ages; severall deep wells,

foot long (called the <HI>Basilisco</HI>) reported to be given to
King <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. by the Emperour.</P>
<P>This Castle (esteemed the most important Castle of
<HI>England,</HI> and key of the same) was valiantly defended
by <HI>Hubert de Burgh</HI> (Constable thereof) against <HI>Lewes</HI>
sonne of <HI>Phillip</HI> King of <HI>France</HI> (who besieged the same

<P>Now as touching the Town<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (which shortly after the
coming of King <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour was much de∣faced
by fire, and afterwards in the year 1295. was again
spoyled, and part thereof burned by the <HI>French</HI>) I find
that (in the time of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor) the
Townesmen were called Burgesses, and it is conceived
that they were antiently incorporated by the name of
Mayor and Commonalty (out of which Commonalty
the Mayor was chosen) and then the Mayor (out of the
Commonalty) chose Assistants for his year (who were
sworne for that purpose) and that from thence the word
<HI>Iurat</HI> (now common to the Magistrates in the Cinque
Ports) was derived, and in the Raigne of King <HI>Edward</HI>
the first this Corporation was stiled Mayor and Commo∣nalty.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="46"/>The antient (and yet) time of election of the Mayor
was, and is, yearly in the afternoon of the ninth day of
<HI>September</HI> (being the next day after the day of the Nati∣vity
of St. <HI>Mary</HI>) antiently in St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Church, but
(that Church decaying) it was afterwards, and still is, in
St. <HI>Maries</HI> Church.</P>
<P>The Towne (at the first beginning of the same to
flourish) began to be much builded on the South-west∣side
thereof, whereas before the stopping of the haven by

<P>This Parish is very populous, and one of the greatest
Parishes in the County (not having a Town therein) and
it so appeared to be, for that antiently upon Collection
of the number of Communicants in every parish in the
County (onely foure Parishes in the same) <HI>viz. Maidstone
Cranbrooke, Feversham,</HI> and <HI>Goudherst</HI> (all which have
Townes in them) were found to have more Commu∣nicants
in them than this, and the same had (within
20. years last past) at the least, 1400. Communicants,
but it hath very many poor therein (the charge where∣of
in the year, 1653. was 209l. 9s. 3d. whereas in the
year 1549.) it was but, 7s. 2d. and although the parso∣nage
<PB N="128" REF="69"/>
of the same be of very good yearly value, yet it hath
for many years past been, and for the future will be a
great cause of sadnesse to the place, that the allowance
for the maintenance of the Minister thereof is very small,
which thus happened.</P>
<P>The Abbot of <HI>Battel</HI> was Patron of the Church, and
(till the dissolution, or surrender of that Abbey) there
was always a Rector incumbent, of one of which number
<HI>(viz. Iohn Crane)</HI> a monument in brasse (mentioning the
same) was till of late times, upon a faire tombe-stone,
in the great Chancell of this Church, and one <HI>Henry
Simons</HI> (at the time of the appropriation herein after men∣tioned)
was Parson incumbent there, But (<HI>Trint. 30.

<HI>Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ij</HI> that year granted the Patronage and Presentation
of the Rectory to <HI>Charles Brandon</HI> (Duke of <HI>Suffolk</HI>) and
that King (11. <HI>December.</HI> 38. of his raigne) granted the
Parsonage to the Dean, and Chapter of <HI>Christ-church Ox∣ford,</HI>
and appropriated the same thereunto (immediate∣ly
after the death of the said <HI>Simons</HI> the incumbent) and
appointed that the said Dean and Chapter should pre∣sent
an able Clarke to the Ordinary (who should be na∣med
perpetuall Vicar of this Church) and should bear
all charges (except reparation of the Chancell) and
should have a dwelling, 12l. 10s 10d. yearly pension,
and should pay the King yearly, for his tenths, 258. 1d.
and be charged with first-fruits (which being done with∣out
the consent of the said Duke, and no act done by
him therein (that appeareth, no Vicar was endowed)
but the Office of <HI>Curate,</HI> was (ever since) given by the
said Dean and Chapter as a Donative, and no first-fruits
were paid, but onely 118. 8d. as a stipendiary.</P>

of some value) some roomes in the Parsonage house (cal∣led

(all which was of so inconsiderable value, that upon
his being sequestred about 13. years since) no other would
accept of the place, but the Parish was destitute of a mi∣nister
by the space of 14. months following, and then
the Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ishioners were inforced (to their great charge) to
provide a Minister: But (not being able to bear that charge
longer) an augmentation was procured from the state
(which in few years afterwards was taken away) and the
former allowance left to the Minister for his mainte∣nance,
which (by reason that the <HI>Easter</HI> book is become
of no value) is but 24l. <HI>per. annum.</HI> (at the most) where∣upon
how this Parish hath since been supplyed with a
Minister, and is like to be for the future) the Reader
may judge.</P>
<P>The Church was founded by the Abbot of <HI>Battle</HI> (in
the raigne of King <HI>Edw.</HI> 3.) whose armes, and his sonns
are at the top of the furthest of the three North windows
in the North chappell or chancell there, and the armes
of the Abbey of <HI>Battle;</HI> and of <HI>Etchingham,</HI> and <HI>Pashley,</HI>
two antient (and then eminent familie▪) in the Parishes
adjoyning <HI>(viz Etchingham,</HI> and <HI>Tiseherst)</HI> are in glasse
at the top of the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st of the said three windowes,
and upon the great beam, at the top of the said
Chancell, was carved the armes of <HI>Congherst</HI> (a
very antient family in this Parish) whose house, of
that name, and inheritance in this Parish (a∣bout
100. years since) came to the family of <HI>Scot,</HI> by
the mariage of <HI>Thomas Scot</HI> with <HI>Mildred</HI> (daughter and
heir of <HI>Thomas Congherst</HI>) and is still remaining in that
family, But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e more antient seat of that family of <HI>Cong∣herst,</HI>
<PB N="130" REF="70"/>
was at a place, in this Parish (neer the County of
<HI>Sussex</HI>) yet called old <HI>Congherst</HI> (which was burned by
the Danes) and the <HI>Mote</HI> and manner of scituation of
the house is still there extant.</P>
<P>In this Chappell also (in the North Windowes of the
same) are the pictures in glasse, of twelve men and their
wives kneeling. <HI>viz.</HI> three at the bottom of each of the
said three Windowes, and three at the top of the middle
of the said three windowes.</P>
<P>These windowes having been broken, and more espe∣cially
of late, what was written under most of them is
not legible, only it appeareth; that the Christian name
of the first was <HI>Robert,</HI> and that the second of them was
<HI>Ioane,</HI> wife of the said <HI>Robert,</HI> and <HI>Simon</HI> their son, prin∣cipall
Founder of that Chappell, who the third was, is not
legible, the fourth was <HI>Ockley,</HI> the fifth was <HI>Delmynden,</HI>
the sixth was <HI>Siesley,</HI> the seventh was <HI>Cockshot,</HI> the eighth
was <HI>Badcock,</HI> and the ninth was <HI>Bartilt,</HI> but who the o∣ther
three were, <HI>viz.</HI> those at the top of the middle
window, is not legible; By tradition, these twelve are
reported to be owners of the twelve Denns, which are
held of <HI>Wye,</HI> but that cannot be, for that onely seven
of the said twelve, are in this Parish, and it is (as afore∣said)
yet discernable, That three of them were <HI>Ockley,
Cockshot</HI> and <HI>Badcock,</HI> none of which were of the said
twelve Denns (though very antient inhabitants in this
Parish) but I rather conceive them to be twelve principal
inhabitants in this Parish, at the time of the foundati∣on
of that Church.</P>
<P>In the great Window of the middle Chancell, were
lately the pictures (well made in glasse) of the good
Kings of <HI>Israel,</HI> and of the Prophets in their times (but
lately spoiled, and defaced.)</P>
<P>There is also in this Church, a memoriall of the in∣terment
there of the family of <HI>Boys,</HI> a family of cheif
esteem in this Parish, both at present, and for severall di∣scents

before, whose ancestor (about 88. years since) came
into this Parish to a fair seat (neer this Church) by him
purchased of <HI>Edmund Roberts</HI> (whose father <HI>Iohn Roberts</HI>
was above 100. years since) buried at the foot of the rea∣ding
deske in this Church, with an effigies, and inscrip∣tion
of brasse upon him lately taken away.</P>
<P>In the South Chancell of this Church was antiently the
image of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and severall tapers or lights
were also in this Church (called the beam light, the pas∣chall
light, <HI>Iudas</HI> candles, St. <HI>Iames</HI> light, and Saint
<HI>Laurence</HI> light, over the North Porch of this Church, is
a roome (antiently called the Treasury) wherein were
and still are (laid up in a chest) severall antient wri∣tings
concerning the tenants of the twelve Dens (in and
neer this Parish) in <HI>Wye</HI> liberty, and concerning lands
and other rights, belonging particularly to this Parish.</P>
<P>The Chest aforesaid had antiently three locks, and the
keyes of the doore of the roome, and of two of the said
three locks, were kept by three Parishioners (t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ants of
<HI>Wye</HI> liberty) and the other key of the chest, was kept by
one of the Churchwardens.</P>
<P>In this Church also is a box fastned upon a post, and
called <HI>the Poor mans box,</HI> which antiently had four lock<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
thereunto (the key of one of which was kept by the pre∣sent
Minister, the keyes of two other of them by the two
Church wardens, and the key of the other by one of the
Parishoners) and in this box were kept the moneys given
to the use of the poor, and securities taken for moneys
lent thereof by the Parish to poor Parishoners.</P>
<P>In this Parish (among other customes, or manners of
tything) there is a custome to pay to the Parson yearly
(by the acre) for Tythe of grass (cut in the lands at, or
neer the Moore) and for sore-Pasture, and after-Pasture

about 800. years since, raised there a Pile or Fort

Govenours of <HI>Dovor</HI> Castle) having that place allotted to
him (about the year 1071.) began the building thereof
the Castle, and called it, by the old name, <HI>Leeds.</HI></P>
<P>At the Northwest part thereof, he built a Chappel; in

(by Sr. <HI>Robert Crevenquer</HI> his son) removed into the Pri∣ory
in this Parish: And <HI>Adam Crevequer</HI> (son of the said
Sir <HI>Robert</HI>) finished that Castle (which flourished till the

Queen <HI>Isabell</HI> (wife of King <HI>Edw.</HI> 2.) in her journey in

but in the absence of the Lord <HI>Badlesmer,</HI> Owner thereof;
then being in Arms for the Barons against that King, she
was, by the then present Governour) denyed entrance,
at which that King, hearing thereof, was incensed, and
laying siege thereunto (about the end of <HI>October</HI> follow∣ing)

<HI>Henry Guldeford,</HI> at that Kings charge, reedified the same;

<P>Here are several things worthy to be inlarged upon,
<HI>viz.</HI> the Castle, the City, the Cathedral and Priory, and
the Bridge; of all which in order.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>And first of the Castle,</HEAD>
<P><HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> about 1700. years since, in the time of
<HI>Cassibelanus</HI> Governour of <HI>Britain,</HI> commanded the same to
be built (according to the <HI>Romane</HI> order) to awe the <HI>Bri∣tains,</HI>
and the same was called the Castle of <HI>Medway,</HI> but
time and tempests utterly decaying the same; <HI>Oes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> or
<HI>Vske,</HI> King of <HI>Kent,</HI> about 1150. years since, caused <HI>Hroff</HI>
one of his chief Councellours, and Lord of this place) to
build a new Castle upon the old foundation, and here∣upon
it took the name of <HI>Hroffes Cester.</HI></P>
<P>About 350 years afterwards <HI>Hasting</HI> the <HI>Dane</HI> besieged,
and much impaired the same: And it afterwards lay de∣solate,
till the time of King <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour
(who caused it to be new built, and put 500. souldiers
(for a guard) therein: To which work <HI>Odo</HI> (Earle of
<HI>Kent,</HI> and brother of that King) was a great Bene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>actor.</P>
<P>Afterwards, in the year 1088. in the time of King <HI>W.
Rufus,</HI> That <HI>Odo</HI> and other Barous held this Castle against
him: (the same being then accounted the strongest, and
most important Castle of <HI>England.</HI>) And his subjects be∣ing
<PB N="226" REF="118"/>
backward to assist him: He proclaimed him to be
accounted a <HI>Niding</HI> (which was then a word of high re∣proach)
that came not to his assistance: whereupon mul∣titudes
came▪ and the resistants were forced to yeeld the
same to the King: And <HI>Gun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulphus,</HI> a Norman, then Bi∣shop
of <HI>Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hester,</HI> repaired and fortified the same, and
built the great Tower therein.</P>
<P>Afterwards in the 17. year of King <HI>Iohn</HI> the Barons
held this Castle against him, but he took the same: And
in the year following <HI>Lewes</HI> (son of <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>France</HI>)
likewise took the same: And King <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. afterwards
gave it to <HI>Guy</HI> of <HI>Rochford</HI> (a <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ictovin</HI>) who was after∣wards
banished, and thereby lost the same.</P>
<P>Afterwards (in the year 1264.) <HI>Simon</HI> Earle of <HI>Leicester</HI>
besiedged the same, and won the Bridge and fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st gate,
and then left the siege.</P>
<P>Afterwards 5. <HI>Rich.</HI> 2. the Commons of this County
strongly besieged this Castle, and by force took a prisoner
out of the same: And thus this Castle ran to decay, and
(the old walls afterwards f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lling) King <HI>Edw.</HI> 4. repaired
both the same and the Castle.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>As concerning the City.</HEAD>
<P>I find it to have been of very great Antiquity, but hath
had several great misfortunes; for about 980. years since,
the same was wasted by <HI>Ethelred,</HI> King of the <HI>Mercians.</HI></P>
<P>About 200. years afterwards, it was assaulted by the
<HI>Danes</HI> (who made a st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ong Castle before the gate thereof,
but were chased away by the then King <HI>Aelfred.</HI></P>
<P>About 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0. years afterwards, it was assaulted, and sub∣dued
by King <HI>Ethelred,</HI> the West <HI>Saxon</HI> King.</P>
<P>Afterwards 7. <HI>May</HI> 1130. the same was much defaced
by fire (King <HI>Hen.</HI> 1. and many of his Nobles then being
present at the Consecration of the Cathedral Church
there.)</P>
<P>3. <HI>Iune</HI> 1137. the same was again (almost all) consu∣med
with fire.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="118"/>The like againe happened there 3. <HI>April.</HI> 1177. So that
It continued desolate till the time of King <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. at
which time it was again repaired.</P>
<P>I finde but one Parish and Church to have been here,
more than now is, and that was called St. <HI>Clement,</HI> which
in the time of King <HI>Edw.</HI> 6. was, by Parliament, united
unto the aforesaid Parish of St. <HI>Nicholas.</HI></P>
<P>I finde also three Mint Houses, to have been granted
by King <HI>Ethelstan,</HI> about the year 930. to be in this City,
<HI>viz</HI> two for the King, and one for the Bishop. And 8.

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>As concerning the Cathedral and Priory.</HEAD>
<P>The same were built by King <HI>Ethelbert</HI> (in the year
600.) and dedicated to the honour of God, and St. <HI>An∣drew,</HI>
Endowed with lands called <HI>Priest Feilds,</HI> and
Channons were put into the same. But the severall de∣vastations
aforesaid of the City, by the <HI>Mercians, Danes,</HI>
and West <HI>Saxons,</HI> also caused the decay both of this
Church and Priory, both which were new builded by
the aforesaid <HI>Gundulphus</HI> (being Bishop there) about the
year 1080. And instead of six Priests (at his coming
found therein) he placed there 60 black Monks (of the ord∣ of
St. <HI>Benedict.</HI>) And transl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted into the new Church the
bodies of <HI>Paulinus</HI> (a Romane by Birth) and others his
Predecessors Bishops of that Sea) which were buried in
the former (to which new Church <HI>Earnulphus</HI> Bishop there
in the time of King <HI>Hen.</HI> 1. was a great Benefactor.) And
to make this Church more famous (about the year 1087)
The aforesaid <HI>Paulinus</HI> (who had been dead 440. years
before) was Canonized for a Saint, and inshrined in
Silver by <HI>Lanfranck</HI> (then Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI>) and
many Devotions and Oblations were made to the same.

neer this City (in his jou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ney towards the Holy Land)
and buried in that Church, he was by the aforesaid Bi∣shop
<HI>Laurence</HI> (about the year 1256.) procured to be
Canonized for a Saint (to whose Shrine, was great resort
and gifts) and the wealth, and repute of this Church
was much encreased, so that (at the suppression of <HI>Mona∣steries</HI>)
This Priory was valued at 486l. 11s. 5d. <HI>per an.</HI>
and (in stead of a Prior, and Covent) was placed in this
Church, a Dean, and six Prebends.</P>
<P>The aforesaid Bishops <HI>Gundulphus,</HI> and <HI>Gilbert,</HI> were
buried in this Church, as was also <HI>Haymo</HI> of <HI>Hith, Iohn</HI>

<P><PB N="229" REF="119"/>And as concerning the Bridge.</P>
<P>There was antiently a very strong Timber Bridge

<P>Afterward in the year 1281., there hapning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o great,
and so long, a Frost, and Snow, that people passed on foot
over this River from <HI>Rochester</HI> to <HI>Stroud,</HI> and that Frost
suddenly breaking, the remaines of the aforesaid old
bridge was borne down, and carried away, with the
stream.</P>
<P>Afterwards another bridge was builded, which 10.
<HI>Rich.</HI> 2. upon rumour of the coming of the <HI>French,</HI> was
beaten down.</P>
<P>Afterwards (in the time of that King) Sir <HI>Robert
Kno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es</HI> built the Faire Stone Bridge now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here, and Sir

<P>Afterwards much of the revenue belonging <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the

<P>By Burnings by the Danes (above 640. years since) by
burning again about 150. years afterwards. But that
which is conceived to have added to the decay thereof (of

of <HI>Christ-church,</HI> and St. <HI>Augusti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> and the other

<P>To which also may be added, the late ruine of the Ca∣thedral,

to be feared) will more eclipse the glory, and wellfare

<P>And touching the Castle here, which is, and alwayes
hath been (without scruple) in the County of <HI>Kent,</HI> ma∣ny
questions have been made touching the foundation
thereof, but I shall onely briefly touch thereupon.</P>
<P>I find it was by (the command of <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> the Ro∣mane
Emperour) at his coming into this Nation (about
1700 years since) built according to the Romane order)
and <HI>Hengist</HI> (King of <HI>Kent</HI>) about 200. years since, com∣mitted
the Goverment thereof to one <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dias</HI> (a Saxon)
who governing the same many years, it gained the name
of <HI>Lodias Castle,</HI> (which name it retained untill, and in
the time of King <HI>Ethelbert,</HI> who, (about 150. years after∣wards)
upon his conversion to the Christian faith, giving
to <HI>Augustine</HI> (the Monk) his cheif seate at <HI>Canterbury,</HI>
reserved (by name) <HI>Lodias Castle.</HI></P>
<P>Afterwards the Danes (as aforesaid) burning this City,
also raced this Castle, which continued ruined, till the
co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing of King <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror (who built, and for∣tified
a Castle, upon the old foundation, called the same
<PB N="303" REF="156"/>
the New Castle, and gar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isoned therein 700. men.</P>
<P>Afterwards King <HI>Stephen,</HI> committed the custody there∣of
to <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Ipre</HI> (Earle of <HI>Kent</HI>) and since (by length
and changes of times, and by tempests) the same is be∣come
much ruined, yet the generall Sessions of the peace
for the County, is here usually holden, twice in the year
(<HI>viz</HI> in <HI>Iuly,</HI> and <HI>Ianuary.</HI>)</P>
<P>The place is reported to be in the aforesaid Parish of St
<HI>Mildred</HI> (but in no hundred) and now (for the reasons
aforesaid) I forbear further inlargement, either touch∣ing
this City, or Castle.</P>
<P>By what is before written, it appeareth that this
County of <HI>Kent,</HI> is divided into two divisions (<HI>viz.</HI> West,
and East.)</P>
<P>Which West division abutteth to the river of <HI>Thames</HI>
towards the North, to the County of <HI>Surrey</HI> towards the
