<HEAD>TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>THere being no <HI>Dedication</HI> of this Dis∣course;
a <HI>Preface</HI> is therefore not only
the more allowable, but necessary. For
how vain, as well as impertinent soever,
they are deservedly accounted, who think either to
recommend, or to cover, an unseasonable, useless
and trifling Book, from Censure, Contempt and Ridi∣cule,
by their Emitting it under the usurped <HI>Pa∣tronage</HI>
of a great Name; yet it is to Treat
those, into whose Hands Authors are ambitious to
have their Papers to fall, and of whose good Opi∣nion
they are covetous, with Rudeness, as well as
with want of Respect, not to afford them those pre∣vious
Advertisements, and vouchsafe them the
Lights which may let them decently in to what they
are invited to Peruse, and serve both to obviate
Misapprehensions of the Writer, and to prevent
Groundless and Satyrical Reflections upon his Per∣formance.</P>
<P>And the endeavouring of the one and the other
of these, is the more indispensably needful in the
present case; in that (if credit may be given to
vulgar Reports) there are some advanc'd to Emi∣nent


<PB REF="3"/>
Posts, and cloath'd with lofty Characters,
who from <HI>Politicks</HI> peculiar to themselves, have
declar'd their Opinions, and oracularly given forth
their Decisions, concerning the <HI>Question</HI> hereafter
Debated, as if they were <HI>Partizans</HI> of the <HI>King</HI>
of <HI>Spain,</HI> rather than <HI>State-Councellors</HI> and <HI>Ci∣vil
Ministers</HI> of His <HI>Britannick Majesty.</HI> For
besides their having in their private Conversations
not only question'd, but aspersed the Legality and
Justice of the late Vndertaking of the <HI>Scots</HI> at <HI>Da∣rien;</HI>
they are by their Friends, as well as by their
Enemies, represented to have given both Encourage∣ment
unto, aud to have bestowed liberal Rewards
upon, the unmannerly, little and despicable Writer
of the <HI>Defence of the</HI> Scots <HI>Abdicating</HI> Darien.
In which scurrilous <HI>Pamphlet,</HI> there are not only
those intollerable Invectives against the whole <HI>King∣dom</HI>
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as well as against the <HI>Directors</HI>
of their <HI>Indian</HI> and <HI>African Company,</HI> that are more
calulated to exasperate that Nation, and to run them
into disloyalty, than any ways adapted to allay their
Resentments, and to quench their intemperate Heats
under that misfortune; but there are likewise such
insolent assertions, and those bottom'd upon Brutal
Ignorance, in relation to the Legitimacy of the De∣sign
to have Setled upon the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>America,</HI>
that no <HI>Spaniard</HI> wou'd have had either the effron∣tery,
or the ill breeding to have utter'd them.</P>
<P>For, as if it were not enough for the Mercinary
Scribler, to assume the impudence of affirming, that
the Motives upon which the <HI>Proclamations</HI> were
emitted in the <HI>English West-India</HI> Colonies, <HI>for∣bidding
the Supplying, Relieving, and Assist∣ing
the</HI> Scots <HI>at</HI> Darien, <HI>or in any parts of</HI> Ame∣rica,
<HI>where they should Settle,</HI> was because <HI>the


<PB REF="3"/>
Government of</HI> England <HI>would not be acces∣sary
to an Act, which the World might judge
to be Felonious, p.</HI> 4. of his Epist. Dedicat.
he takes the boldness to add afterwards in Terms
that are most slanderous, as well as defamatory,
<HI>p.</HI> 7. of the same <HI>Epistle,</HI> that their attempt of
<HI>Planting</HI> on the <HI>Isthmus, was the Setling a Co∣lony
in another Man's Dominions, unless by
vertue of their Presbyterian Tenet of Domini∣ons
being founded in Grace, the</HI> Scots, <HI>who
are the presumptive Elect, pretend a Divine
Right to the Goods of the Wicked, and so
take upon them to cloath the Councellors of
their Colony, with such another Commission,
as God gave the</HI> Hebrews <HI>when they departed
out of</HI> Egypt. Which Language tho' agreeable to
the Education, Manners, Politicks, and Inferior
Stations of <HI>Harris</HI> and <HI>D—1</HI> to have been the one
the Belcher, and the other the Voucher of; yet it
cannot miss being esteemed extremely odd and in∣congruous,
that a Person, who is not only a Schol∣lar,
a Gentleman, but a Minister of State, should
be reputed to have both authorized the reproachful
Falshood, and to have paid liberaly for the inven∣ting
and divulging of it.</P>
<P>But the forwardness express'd by one in an Ho∣nourable
Office (and as is commonly said with Ra∣ptures
of Joy) in the speedy Communication to the
<HI>Spanish Ambassador,</HI> that <HI>the Scots had aban∣donn'd</HI>
Darien, would seem not only to insinuate
his being possess'd with a greater Picque against the
Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> (omitting at present all
those further Instances that give evidence of it,
which occur numerously enough both in the fore∣mention'd
<HI>Pamphlet,</HI> and in that other, Stil'd,


<PB REF="4"/>
<HI>The Defence of the</HI> Scots <HI>Settlement at</HI> Da∣rien
<HI>Answer'd,</HI> which are Publish'd under the
Safeguard of his Countenance, as well as Vented
and Sold with his Connivance) than is reconcilea∣ble
with the Duty of one in his <HI>Post</HI> under a
Prince, who is no less King and Soveraign of that
<HI>Nation,</HI> than he is of <HI>England;</HI> but it doth also
intimate a warmer concern for the Interest of the
Catholick King, and for the having his desires, and
the wishes of his Subjects complied with and grati∣fied,
than was either prudential for an <HI>English Se∣cretary</HI>
of State, or correspondent to the Zeal
which a Person in his Station ought to have had
for the Success and Prosperity of all and of every
one of his <HI>Masters</HI> People in their Vndertakings,
to have rendred himself obnoxious to the being
charged with. Not to add how little and mean it
was in it self, and what aversion from, and dis∣affection
it proclaimed against the <HI>Scots,</HI> to have af∣fected
the Pleasure and coveted the Glory of being
the first Author and Conveyer of that <HI>News</HI> to the
forementioned <HI>Ambassador.</HI> Especially when trans∣mitted
to himself upon no surer Intelligence, than
that such a Report being arrived at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> the
Tydings thereof were dispatch'd hither by one
who might be suspected the more credulous in believ∣ing
it; because it was that which out of Enmity to
the <HI>Caledonian Colony</HI> he earnestly longed for and
desired.</P>
<P><HI>Nor is it without a</HI> Pointed <HI>(tho' but tacit) Re∣flection
upon a certain Gentleman's Conduct in this
Matter, that the</HI> Writer <HI>of the</HI> Paris Gazette <HI>of</HI>
Nov. 14. <HI>hath inserted in the</HI> Paragraph <HI>from</HI> Ma∣drid
<HI>of</HI> October 22. <HI>That</HI> il arriva ici le 14
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Courier extraordinaire des pesche de Lon∣dres


<PB REF="4"/>
par le Marquis de Canales Ambassadeur
d'Espagne en Angleterre avec s'avis de l'aban∣donement
de le Colonie de Darien, qui avoit
este receu par un des Secretaires d'Estat &amp;
Communique a cet Ambassadeur, There had
on the 14th an extraordinary Courier come
thither from the Marquis of <HI>Canales</HI> the Spa∣nish
Ambassador in <HI>England,</HI> wish News of the
abandoning the Colony at <HI>Darien,</HI> which one
of the Secretaries of State having received,
had Communicated to the said Ambassador.</P>
<P>But there having been a Message delivered since
by the same <HI>English Minister</HI> to the said <HI>Foreign
Ambassador,</HI> which how ravishing soever it might
be unto the <HI>former</HI> to Convey, could not be very
joyous and delightful to the <HI>latter</HI> to Receive; I shall
only observe in relation to the diversity of the Mat∣ter,
and the different relish between the said <HI>Mes∣sage</HI>
and the foregoing <HI>Intelligence,</HI> that there is
sometimes a vast dissimilitude, betwixt what one may
find himself obliged to perform in obedience to the
Order and Injunction of a <HI>Master,</HI> who is no less
wise in what he Commands, than Authoratative and
Vncontrolable in the having it Executed; and what
the same Person may run himself into the indiscretion
of <HI>Doing</HI> when not directed by a greater Prudence
than his own, nor over-ruled by a Superior Autho∣rity.</P>
<P>Which I do take the liberty the rather to suggest,
in that it is too often the misfortune of <HI>Princes,</HI> to
have even those Actions of their <HI>Ministers,</HI> of which
they were not previously in the least conscious, and
much less had enjoyned, to be interpreted as if done
either in obedience to their positive Command and spe∣cial
Direction, or in order to humour their Inclina∣tions


<PB REF="5"/>
and to comply with their Sentiments. There being
but few Men in the World who render the Justice
and pay that Deference to Kings, as to distinguish
with that impartiality and exactness which they ought,
between what Persons raised to Emenent Posts in the
Administration, are to have imputed unto them as
Acting in abstraction from their Offices, and as they
come to be considered only <HI>Personally;</HI> and what
they are to be held accountable for as behaving them∣selves
correspondently to the Characters which they
bear, and to the Trusts which are repos'd in them;
and as they govern and regulate themselves in the se∣veral
and respective parts of their Administrations,
both in conformity to the Laws, and to the Measures
of <HI>Biensance</HI> and Decency, which their Masters out
of respect to their own Honour and Glory, as well as
from Principles of Wisdom and Justice, are to
be always suppos'd to require, as well as to wish, that
they may neither trespass against, nor in the least de∣viate
from. For as Monarchs and Soveraign Prin∣ces,
notwithstanding the Innocence of their own Pur∣poses,
and the Righteousness of their Designs towards
their Subjects and People, do seldom escape obloquy
and blame, when they upon whom the execution and
the exercise of their Authority is devolved, are found
to offend against the Laws, which stand enacted
and established to be the Standards and Boundaries
of Governing and Ruling Power; so it is hardly to
be avoided, let Kings and Potentates be never so
justly Celebrated, by reason of their own Wisdom,
and the Mannerliness of their whole Royal Conduct,
but that there will be found pevish and ill-natur'd
People enough, ready to sully the Fame, and to de∣tract
from the Glory of their Prudence, in case
they who are employ'd in the chiefest Offices of the


<PB REF="5"/>
State, are observed to over-look and forget the Rules
of decency, and to trespass against the Forms of Ci∣vility
and the Maxims of Discretion.</P>
<P>And that what I have represented, may appear
to have been said from a dutiful regard to His
Majesty's Honour and Safety, let me be allow'd to
set both the Cases in a clearer Light, by the Pro∣posal
of two Suppositions, whereof there are
Proofs within view, to shew that they are not visio∣nary
and chimerical. For example, let His Ma∣jesty
be never so Merciful, as well as Just, never∣theless
it will be impossible, during a season wherein
there is no suspension upon any Acts of Parliament,
that his Government should escape the censure of
being not only Rigorous and Severe, but Arbitrary
and Despotical, if a Person trusted with Authority
and Power of causing Seize and Apprehend such as
are Informed and Sworn against to be Plotters and
Conspirators against the Safety of His Majesty's
Person, the Tranquility of his Government, or the
Peace of his Dominions, should under that Cover
and Pretence, so far contemn and trample upon the
many and several Laws of <HI>England,</HI> which have
been made for the preservation of the Liberty of
English Subjects, as to cause Take up, and by his
Warrants to confine under aspersion of High Trea∣son
whom he pleaseth, without the vouchsafing to men∣tion
in those Warrants his having received Deposi∣tions
upon Oath specifying and importing the Crimes
for which he Commits them. Which as it doth of∣ten
prove to be the Ruining them in their Estates
and Fortunes, as well as the scandalizing and black∣ning
them in their Names, Credits and Reputations,
thro' the charging them with the guilt of disgrace∣ful
and capital Offences; so it is no less than the


<PB REF="6"/>
reducing and bringing the People of <HI>England</HI> in∣to
a state and condition of absolute and down right
Slavery, by the making the Liberty of every <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Subject, as well as of some, to depend precu∣riously,
and at the same time entirely, upon the
humour of him who assumeth unto himself the
Exercise of such a Jurisdiction. Which makes me
astonished, that they who covet to Act after this
illimited and unconfined rate, are not more Friend∣ly
and Kind to <HI>Scotland,</HI> than they have hither∣to
chosen to shew themselves in that no more is
required there, for the Empowering those in the
Administration to throw Men into Prison, with∣out
their admission to Baile, or the being brought
to Tryal, but that they do suspect them to be
Seditious Disloyal or Traiterous.</P>
<P>Likewise, let the King behave himself towards
the Subjects of all, or of any of his Kingdoms,
with never so much Condescension, Goodness, and
Compassion, sincerely and joyfully congratulating
their Prosperity, and Condoleing and Simpathiz∣ing
with them under their Calamities; (as the
King with great Tenderness hath lately done to∣wards
the <HI>Scots</HI> Company, thro' telling them in
his Answer to their Address, that he is sorry for
the Dammage which they and their Country have
sustained in and by the Loss of their <HI>Colony)</HI>
yet none of all these things will be found suffici∣ent
to preserve him in the hearty Affections
awful Esteem, and firm Confidence of those Sub∣jects
of such of his Dominions, who find their Na∣tion
made the object of the scorn, ridicule and con∣tempt;
its welfare the motive of the Envy and
hatred; and their misfortune the matter and
ground of the pleasure and delight of those, whom


<PB REF="6"/>
he hath honored with the first places in the Exer∣cise
of his Authority, and in the Administration
of the affairs of State in whatsoever Dominion it be
under his Subjection.</P>
<P>However it may not be amiss to observe, that how
discontented and clamorous soever the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
have been, because of the <HI>Scots</HI> endeavouring to
have setled at <HI>Darien;</HI> and how unkind, as well as
unassistent unto them, (whether upon imaginary mo∣tives
of Justice, or real inducements of State, I
shall not determine) such have shewed themselves,
whose Favour and Protection they expected in the
supporting them in that undertaking, and how great
and Damageable thereupon their Disappointments
and Losses have proved, which while they cause
sorrow to them, do administer occasion of Joy to o∣thers,
whose characters it doth very ill accord
with and become; yet that it is some consolation
both to their <HI>Company,</HI> and their whole Kingdom
that the <HI>Representation a Messrs les primie∣res
Ministres d' Angleterre, The memorial or
manifest given into the Lords Justices by the</HI>
Spanish <HI>Ambassador in</HI> September <HI>last,</HI> was not
in the least occasion'd by, nor bottom'd upon any
thing relative to their <HI>Colony</HI> upon the <HI>Ameri∣can
Isthmus.</HI> So that whatsoever the Consequen∣ces
of that <HI>Memorial,</HI> and of his <HI>Britannick
Majesty</HI> just <HI>Resentment</HI> of it may be, yet
none of them, can either now, or hereafter, be
said to have sprung and flowed from any Fact
or Enterprize of the <HI>Scots.</HI></P>
<P>And tho' I do not pretend to any knowledge of
those Consultations, Treaties and Stipulations, (save
as they are there expressed to have been. <HI>Sur la
succession de la couronne d' Espagne, &amp; sa


<PB REF="7"/>
Division and Repartition, about the Succession
to the Crown of</HI> Spain, <HI>and the Division and
Repartition of that Monarcy)</HI> wherein His Ma∣jesty
having been concerned, gave occasion and
administred ground for that <HI>Memorial,</HI> which
was so displeasing unto Him, that he thereupon
Commanded the <HI>Spanish Ambassador,</HI> who deli∣ver'd
it, to depart within <HI>Eighteen</HI> days out of
his Kingdom, and in that time not to go out of
his Gate; yet I hope it will neither be accounted
Presumption, nor an Intrusion upon Secrets and
Mysteries of State to say, that nothing could have
contributed so much to the obviating all such misun∣derstandings
between the two Crowns, as should
swell into and terminate in a Rupture, as the hav∣ing
protected the <HI>Scots</HI> in their settlement at <HI>Da∣rien</HI>
would have done. For as the having a <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lony</HI>
Establish'd in the very Heart and Bosome
of the <HI>Spanish American</HI> Dominions, and accomo∣dated
with a Defenceable Harbour, that is capa∣ble
of receiving the whole Naval strength of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
would (unless the Cabinet Resolutions at
<HI>Madrid,</HI> be the Results of Passion and Haughtiness,
rather than of sedate thoughts, Political Wisdom,
and of Debates where arguments derived from safe∣ty
and interest cast the scale) effectually check
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> against falling into rash and
hasty Councils, and an infallible motive for re∣straining
the <HI>Catholick King</HI> from emarquing in
a War with His <HI>Britannick Majesty,</HI> because of
the unavoidable mischiefs, that upon our being
so Circumstanced and Stated thro' the possession
of that place, would attend it in relation to the ma∣ny
great and opulent Territories of the <HI>Spanish</HI>
Monarchy in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> which are both


<PB REF="7"/>
the sources of all that Wealth and Treasure which
inable them to defend their Kingdoms and Pro∣vinces
in <HI>Europe,</HI> and do afford them the means
and advantages of supporting themselves in that
veneration and esteem, which are paid them, and
rendred unto that Crown in this part of the
World; so it is not to be doubted, should a War
Commence upon any inducements and reasons whatso∣ever,
whether fancied or real, slight or weighty, between
the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>Monarch</HI> of Great
<HI>Britain,</HI> but that thro' our being so <HI>Posted</HI> in the
midst of their <HI>American</HI> Plantations, they would
soon be made sensible of their betaking themselves
thereby to a course and method that will unavoid∣able
issue in their Ruine.</P>
<P>For tho' no Man that pretendeth to good Sense can
have the weakness to imagine; nor any who are under
the Ties of Allegiance and Fealty, can have the Disloy∣alty
to suspect; that the coldness and indifference
of the Court of <HI>England,</HI> in reference to the
<HI>Scots</HI> being encouraged and supported at <HI>Darien,</HI>
(to say nothing of the measures that have been
taken and pursued, not only to the Disheartening
and Obstructing them in their Design, but to the
defeating it, thro' rendring as far as could be ef∣fected,
without open and direct hostility, their
continuance in that place impracticable) was either
in subserviency to the better concealing and covering
those Transactions, which were then carrying on,
and are since discovered and divulged, concerning
the adjusting and determining the <HI>Succession to
the Crown of Spain,</HI> or in order, at the ex∣pence
of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> and the Di∣shonour
as well as the Loss sustained by their
<HI>African</HI> and <HI>India</HI> Company, to have the more


<PB REF="8"/>
easily reconciled, what was at that time under
Consultation and Treaty towards the being Con∣certed
and Stipulated, to the Catholick King and
his Ministers; yet it may both with Modesty and
Safety be affirmed, that among other means which
would have both Advanced His <HI>Majesty</HI> above
the threats and menaces of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who
endeavour to allarm him, that unless all that he
hath projected in the foremention'd Affair, be
<HI>promptement arreste, viendra un Guerre Fu∣neste
&amp; universelle dans toute te Europe,
speedily renounced, there will arise a de∣structive
and general War thro' all Eu∣rope,</HI>
but inabled him to justify and to make
good by his Power and Force, what he hath by
his great Prudence and Wisdom been Adjusting
and Contracting with others in reference to the
foresaid matter. It would have also been in
some degree useful and subservient thereunto, if
instead of lending his Name and Authority to
those who emitted the <HI>Proclamations</HI> in the <HI>Eng∣lish
West-India Plantations,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See that set forth by the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Bellamont. June</HI> 3. 1699.</NOTE> prohibiting <HI>the
holding any Correspondence with, or the
giving any Assistance unto, any Person or
Persons, that had been Fitted out in</HI> Scot∣land
<HI>with Ships of Force to settle in some
part of</HI> America, he had vouchsaved unto his
Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> those Testimonies of his
Royal Care and Zeal for their Success in the
expedition they went upon, and for their pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sper∣ing
in the design in which they were Embarqu'd,
as might have made them out of Gratitude,

<P>

<PB REF="8"/>
For as it is a great Satisfaction to a Prince, and
that which gives him a Reputation, and at such
a juncture and in those circumstances, renders him
formidable to those who seem inclined, and do only
covet a favourable opportunity of declaring them∣selves
his Enemies, to be universally known to have
a firm Tenure in the Affections and Confidences of
all his People, and to be understood to have their
Wealth and Power ready to be surrendred with rea∣diness
and chearfulness unto his Disposal, and their

him, and also lessen his Credit and Veneration with
those Potentates, that Envy the greatness of his Vn∣dertakings,

Part and Proportion of the whole Body of his Sub∣jects

Behaviour of those towards them, who being in the

and avoided, without His Majesty's becoming

of <HI>Spain,</HI> and an <HI>Infraction</HI> of <HI>Alliances</HI> with that
Crown, or that can reasonably be held <HI>prejudicial</HI>
to the <HI>Interest</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> either in their Manu∣factures
and Commerce at home, or with respect to
the Flourishing and Traffick of their Plantations a∣broad,
being the Subject of the ensuing <HI>Discourse,</HI>
I do without craving the lenity and favour, or de∣precating
the prejudice and severity of any, submit
it to the Judgment and Verdict of all such, who
understand the Laws of Nature and Nations, have
examin'd the Alliances that have been contracted
between the Crowns of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI>
and who are able to judge of what is advantagious
to the British Kingdoms, whether collectively or dis∣junctively
consider'd.</P>
<P><HI>And I am sure, that whatsoever hath been al∣ledged
by the</HI> Spaniards <HI>in the</HI> Memorial <HI>presented
by the</HI> Spanish Ambassador <HI>to His</HI> Majesty <HI>in</HI>
May <HI>last, for the blackning and aspersing the De∣sign
and Attempt of the</HI> Scots, <HI>with respect to
their Setling a</HI> Colony <HI>upon the</HI> Isthmus <HI>of</HI> Da∣rien,
<HI>(all which will in the following</HI> Sheets <HI>be
brought under Disquisition, and demonstrated to be
Groundless, Frivolous, and Impertinent) yet that it
hath no Analogy, nor beareth any Proportion with the
undecency, severity and defamatoriness of the Lan∣guage,
which occurreth in the</HI> Memorial <HI>exhibited
by the same</HI> Minister <HI>to the</HI> Lords Justices <HI>in the
Month of</HI> September. <HI>Wherein he upbraids and
reproaches a Great and Wise, as well as an Imme∣diate
Personal Transaction of His Majesty, as if
therein he had not only been</HI> Emporter a l'am∣bition
d'usurper &amp; bouleverser les Pais d'au∣truii,
Hurried into the ambition of usurping a
Power over, and of endeavouring to subvert


<PB REF="9"/>
the Dominions of another Prince; <HI>and that if
such an Act stand allowed,</HI> Il ny auroit ni Sta∣tutes
ni Loys Municipales, a observer chez les
unes ni chez les autres qui ni fuisse Libres de
attentates d'autruii, There will neither remain
Statute nor Municipal Laws observable between
Princes, which will not be liable to be inva∣ded,
and freely broken in upon; <HI>but he farther
calls it such an Action towards the Catholick King,
that by reason of the influence, which it may have
upon his Subjects,</HI> Pour tenter la Foy, &amp; exciter
leur Esprits a des soulevements, In tempting
them from their Allegiance, and by exciting
them to Mutinies and Insurrections, is not con∣sistent,
a la bon Foy qui se doit observer en∣tre
les Chretiens, &amp; a la plus fort raison en∣tre
des Allies &amp; Amis, With that sincerity
which should be observed among Christians,
and much more among those that are Allies
and Friends; <HI>being withal such a Practise, that if
suffered,</HI> Il ny aucoune Nation, ni Domination en
Europe en surete contre les machinations &amp;
tromperies de la plus Fort, ou de la plus
malicieux, There will be no Nation or King∣dom
in Europe in safety against the Contri∣vances
and Deceits of such, as are either Power∣ful
or Malicious.</P>
<P>All which I have therefore called over and men∣tion'd
(and would not otherwise have done it) that
they who have appear'd unfriendly unto, and offended at
the <HI>Scots</HI> Vndertaking, thro' the suffering themselves
to receive sinistruous impressions of it, upon its being
represented in the foremention'd <HI>Memorial</HI> of <HI>May 3.
As an Invasion upon the Dominions of His
Catholick Majesty, and an Infraction of the Al∣liances


<PB REF="10"/>
between the two Crowns,</HI> may from their
being made acquainted with the foulness and un∣decency
of the Terms that are bestowed upon the
Stipulation which the King of <HI>Great Britain</HI> hath
been concerting, to the happiness of the very <HI>Spa∣nsards</HI>
themselves, as well as for the future tran∣quility
of all the <HI>Soveraignties</HI> and <HI>Principalities</HI>
of <HI>Europe,</HI> be from thence henceforward convinced,
that the Credit and Authority of a <HI>Spanish Me∣morial</HI>
is too lubricous and sandy a Foundation to
build an Opinion upon, of the Illegality and Inju∣stice
of a Transaction, Enterprize and Fact. And
as I hope the having unanswerably prov'd, that the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> were wonderfully mistaken in the Ap∣pellations
which they gave to the <HI>Scots</HI> Landing and
their beginning to erect a Plantation upon the <HI>Isth∣mus</HI>
of <HI>America;</HI> so I doubt not, but that the
Projection, for which His Majesty is so undecently
treated, and dishonourably aspersed, will be both
vindicated from all the Obloquies cast upon and af∣fixed
unto him; and also justified to have been the
Result and Effect of a Wisdom, that future Ages,
as well as the present, will admire and magnify him
for. Only care in that case must be taken, that
they who shall be honoured with the Trust of being
employ'd in such a Noble Work, may not be of
those Persons chusing, who selected and pitched up∣on
the <HI>Writers</HI> of the <HI>Pamphlets,</HI> call'd, <HI>The
Defence of the</HI> Scots <HI>Abdicating</HI> Darien; <HI>and
the Defence of their Settlement at it Answer'd,</HI>
these being with respect to Sense, Truth, Reason,
and good Manners, the most silly, ridiculous, and
ignominious Creatures, that ever the Name of Au∣thors
was conferr'd upon.</P>
<P>

<PB REF="10"/>
And that their Performances in their several
and respective ways, which are such as proclaim the
<HI>Intellectuals</HI> of both of them mean, and the <HI>Morals</HI>
of one of them very bad, are not arraigned and ex∣posed
in the ensuing <HI>Discourse,</HI> is, because of its
having been fully written and finished, before the
Scurrilities of the <HI>one,</HI> and the Impertinencies of
the <HI>other,</HI> towards the blackning of the <HI>Conduct</HI> of
the <HI>Scots,</HI> or the disproving the <HI>Legitimacy</HI> of
their <HI>Undertaking,</HI> were obtruded upon the World;
as likewise previously to the <HI>Publication</HI> of the Book
that is Stil'd, <HI>A Defence of the</HI> Scots <HI>Settlement
at</HI> Darien, <HI>with an Answer to the Spanish Me∣morial
against it.</HI> And as I have not upon the
perusal of the <HI>last</HI> either added unto, or substra∣cted
from what I had antecedently written, which
may serve to vindicate me from being accounted a
<HI>Plagiary,</HI> in case that in our Reasonings upon a
<HI>Subject</HI> that is the <HI>same</HI> there do here and there
appear, not only an <HI>affinity</HI> of Stile and Language,
but a <HI>Concidence</HI> of Thoughts, whether in the
mentioning of Facts, or in the citing of Authori∣ties;
so I do not think it necessary to Reply any
thing to what by some may be held Argumentative
in either of the other two formention'd <HI>Pamphlets,</HI>
as reckoning that whatsoever occurreth in them of
that Nature and Tendency, to be sufficiently obvia∣ted,
and in way of Answer fully anticipated, in
what is Represented and Argued in the following
<HI>Sheets;</HI> and much less can I prevail upon my self,
to wast my own time, and give entertainment to
the judicious part of Mankind (whom I do only
covet to be the Readers of what I write) in the
detecting the Calumnies and Falshoods, and in re∣buking
the Petulancy of a Mercenary Scribler, that


<PB REF="11"/>
hath been brib'd with Money to defame a Nation,
and to throw that Dirt upon Persons of Integrity
and Honour, which a little scandalous Fellow, who
had been expell'd some time ago out of His Ma∣jesty's
<HI>Navy</HI> for his Crimes and Misdemeanours
(and who thereupon spoke as scandalously and re∣vilingly
then of the <HI>English,</HI> as he hath lately done
of the <HI>Scots)</HI> had rak'd and gather'd together. The
only thing which I shall therefore say, for over∣throwing
the Faith, Reputation and Credit, of that
detractive Miscreant in his many other Fictitious
and Romantick Stories, shall be to refer those, who
are not willing to be misled in their Belief of Men
and Things by Lies and Fables impos'd with im∣pudence
and audacity upon them, to Mr. <HI>Wafer,</HI>
who can and will assure them, that the Aspersions
thrown upon the <HI>Scots,</HI> in relation to their Treating
of him, are as false, as they are defamatory. So
that thro' the Fellow's appearing a <HI>Liar</HI> in one Case,
he is to be accounted incapable of having his Te∣stimony
receiv'd in all other whatsoever. Nor can
any, without the renouncing of common Sense, be∣lieve
that the Gentlemen employ'd by the <HI>Company</HI>
to Confer and Transact with Mr. <HI>Wafer,</HI> cou'd
be guilty of such Weakness and Folly, as to reveal
and detect unto him their Design upon <HI>Darien,</HI> in
that the whole Success of that Vndertaking, depen∣ded
entirely upon its being kept and preserved a Se∣cret.</P>
<P>However it may not be amiss to take notice of a
certain Passage in that Fabulous Book, which is to be
met with <HI>Page</HI> 16. namely, <HI>That just as the</HI> Scots
<HI>Companies Books were open'd at</HI> Amsterdam,
<HI>for the Receiving Subscriptions to their Stock
and Capital, the</HI> Dutch East <HI>and</HI> West-India


<PB REF="11"/>
<HI>Companies run open mouth'd to the Lords of
that City, shewing what was hatching by the</HI>
Scots <HI>Commissioners in their Town, to Ruine
the Trade of the United Provinces.</HI> Which I
have therefore the rather cited, because it is <HI>one</HI>
of the few that have any Truth in them, and not
to administer occasion unto any Men (tho' I fear
many will be ready to take it from thence without
my leave or allowance) for suspecting, and much
less for concluding, that our <HI>Councils</HI> in <HI>England,</HI>
are too much under the influence of the <HI>Hollan∣ders,</HI>
and accommodated to such Measures, as are
subservient to a <HI>Dutch</HI> Interest. For tho' the un∣thinking
Creature who communicated the Story to
the Writer, and the unwary Statesman and indiffe∣rent
Politician, under whose Countenance as well as
Connivance it stands publish'd, might no ways de∣sign
the begetting and fomenting such an Opinion,
yet it is so adapted to justify an apprehension of
that Nature, that not only such who are disaffected
to the Government, but many that place their hap∣piness,
and do find their Profit in being under it,
will be ready to fall into the Notion, and to imbibe
the Sentiment. Especially seeing as well the Pro∣ceedings
<HI>here</HI> in discouraging the <HI>Scots</HI> in their
<HI>American</HI> Design, as what hath been done and
practised in the <HI>English West-India Plantations</HI>
by positive Orders and Injunctions from hence, which
have proved very Prejudicial, if not Ruinous unto
them in their Colony, thro' appearing very little sub∣servient
to an English Interest, either here, or in
<HI>America,</HI> will thereupon be construed by those bold
and critical Men, who do both usurp a Liberty of
penetrating into, and a Right of judging and censu∣ring
Resolutions and Actions of State (which ought


<PB REF="12"/>
to be look'd upon with Reverence, and acquiesc'd in
with Silence) to have flow'd either from a Wisdom
in reference to our Concerns, Welfare and Prospe∣rity,
that is indiscoverable and past finding out;
or to have sprung from Reasons relative to the Sa∣tisfaction
and Advantage of that Outlandish and
Foreign Republick, which hath been named.</P>
<P>And as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the other <HI>Pamphlet,</HI> call'd, <HI>The
Defence of the</HI> Scots <HI>Abdicating of</HI> Darien, <HI>An∣swer'd
Paragraph by Paragraph,</HI> whereof the
Author hath written with more Modesty, than he
did on whom I have been Reflecting, tho' at the
same time so weakly and triflingly, that I cannot
bring my self to think, that it needs (for I am
sure it doth not deserve) so much as one Stricture
or Animadversion bestowed upon it, beyond what in
the following Discourse will be found applicable there∣unto.
And indeed that Gentleman's Design seems
(as if playing Booty) he had intended the getting
a Book to pass un<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrested and current under the Vi∣zor
and Mask of being <HI>Answer'd,</HI> which thro' its
want of that Skreen, Cover and Pasport, there were
endeavours used to have stifled and suppressed.
Which appears the more evidently to have been the
scope of the <HI>Answerer,</HI> in that he doth not only
give us the other Book entirely, so far as he
taketh upon him to Reply unto, it which he doth in
his manner with reference to the whole that is Ar∣gumentative
and Discoursive in it; but he annex∣eth,
without the omission of a word, whatsoever oc∣cureth
in the Book, against which he would be thought
to set up as an Antagonist, a Sheet and a half giv∣ing
the <HI>Description</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> without the being
at the expence of a Syllable to contradict or disap∣prove
it. Yea, the main Argument upon which he


<PB REF="12"/>
endeavoureth to justify the Opposition unto, as well
as the Discountenance given by the <HI>Government</HI>
of <HI>England</HI> to the <HI>Scots,</HI> in their <HI>American</HI> Vn∣dertaking,
being taken from a Visionary and Ro∣mantick
<HI>Topick,</HI> and superstructed upon a known
and downright Falshood, it doth thereby become
manifest to all who are endowed with any mea∣sure
of discerning, that his main purport in Wri∣ting,
was to give a <HI>Licence</HI> for the safe and pub∣lick
Sale of a Book, which crept about, and was
here and there vended abroad, only surreptiously
and by stealth before. For whereas he seeks to
have it believed, that all the late <HI>English</HI> Pro∣ceedings
in disfavour and prejudice of the <HI>Scots,</HI>
were in pursuance of and <HI>Address</HI> presented by the
<HI>Parliament</HI> to His Majesty, <HI>Anno</HI> 1695. This
is all mere Dream and Imagination, and no bet∣ter
than a Bantering of Mankind. It being most
certain, that the <HI>Parliament</HI> never entertain'd a
thought, of having Obstruction given to the <HI>King∣dom</HI>
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as to their Setling a <HI>Colony</HI>
either in the <HI>East</HI> or <HI>West-Indies,</HI> provided it
were not where they were the previous Occupiers,
and on condition that it prov'd not in ways, and by
means inconsistent with the Amity that is between
the two Kingdoms, as they stand link'd together
under one Soveraign. Neither could they so far
forget the boundaries unto which they do at all
times circumscribe and confine themselves in their
Parliamentary Actings, as to attempt it in refe∣rence
to a Nation, over which they claim no Ju∣risdiction,
but which they do own to be Absolute
within it self, and altogether Independent upon
them. But the whole which the <HI>Parliament</HI> ap∣plyed


<PB REF="13"/>
unto the <HI>King</HI> about at that time, was that
he would interpose and exert his Authority for the
hindring of his <HI>English</HI> Subjects from becoming
<HI>Subscribers</HI> to the <HI>Stock</HI> and <HI>Capital,</HI> which the
<HI>Scots</HI> were about to make, frame and establish,
for the Erection of a <HI>West</HI> or <HI>East-India Plan∣tation,</HI>
and for the beginning and promoting of a
<HI>Foreign</HI> Trade. Which as they had a Righ and
an Inherent and Legal Power to do, so they
shew'd themselves extreamly Wise and Prudential,
in opposing and defeating that part of the <HI>Scots</HI>
Projection. Seeing shou'd such a Liberty have been
either allowed or connived at in the Subjects of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
much of that Treasure which is employ'd in
their own Traffick and Commerce, and especially to
the <HI>Indies,</HI> might have been put into the <HI>Scots
Bank,</HI> upon the Prospect and Motive of the Profit
that would thereby accrue unto them, thro' the ma∣ny
Privileges and great Immunities, which were
granted unto the <HI>Scots Company</HI> for and during
the Term of 22 Years.</P>
<P>Nor doth he shew himself very prudent, in Re∣flecting
so severely, as he doth, upon the Behaviour
of the <HI>Scots</HI> towards King <HI>Charles I.</HI> in that the
<HI>English</HI> themselves were not only as Disloyal as they,
but both tempted them unto, and rewarded them for
it. Seeing besides their Troops being paid with Eng∣lish
Money, not a few of their Leading Men better'd
their Fortunes, at the expence of this Kingdom, by
their being the Fomenters of the first War, as well
as for being the Instruments of <HI>Scotland</HI>'s joyning to
support the Parliament against the King afterwards.
And whensoever it is seasonable, it can be demon∣strated
from Authentic Memoirs, and such as de∣serve


<PB REF="13"/>
to be Credited, that the <HI>Scots</HI> had neither
Marched into <HI>England,</HI> Anno 1638, nor in 1643,
had they not been universally Courted, and divers
Persons of the first Rank bribed thereunto. It be∣ing
undeniable that the <HI>Ship-Money</HI> and the long <HI>In∣termission</HI>
of <HI>Parliaments</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> influenced
such as in that Kingdom were stil'd <HI>Patriots</HI> (which
whether they were or not I do not enquire) to tempt and
draw in the <HI>Scots</HI> to that bloody and infamous War,
whereas without Encouragements, that I am not
willing to Name from them, the <HI>Scots</HI> would
have upon no Resentments of their own have run
into it, how Bigotted soever some of their Cler∣gy
might at that time have been. And as the
Rebellious part fell equally to the share of both
the Nations, so the Treacherous share both to∣wards
God and Man doth distinguingly affect <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
in that instead of making that King a Glori∣ous
Prince, as they both Swore and Stipulated, pro∣vided
those things were redressed which had been
complained of as amiss in the Administration, they
not only rejected the Concessions which he made▪ that
were more than a wise People would have demanded,
but they Murder'd him. Neither was the Number
of those in <HI>England,</HI> who persever'd in their Alle∣giance
to that King, and suffer'd with him and
for him, greater and more numerous, in pro∣portion
to the People of the one Kingdom and the
other; then they were, who asserted his Interest in
<HI>Scotland</HI> to their Ruine. Nor can I imagine for
what End, that Author recalls those things (which
ought to be for ever forgotten) in such approbrious
and aspersive Terms, unless it be to fasten an Ig∣nominy
and a Reproach upon what hath been since


<PB REF="14"/>
transacted against another Prince, tho' not carry'd
to the height of the <HI>Original.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, were not that Author prodigiously silly, and
altogether unfit for the Province which he under∣took,
he would not upbraid him whom he pretends to
Answer, for having shew'd both Vanity and want
of Judgment, because of his having only said, <HI>That</HI>
Scotland <HI>turned the Ballance in the late Revo∣lution.</HI>
Whereas it is as Demonstrable as any
<HI>Problem</HI> in <HI>Euclid,</HI> that if the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
had Vnanimously <HI>Declar'd</HI> against the <HI>Abdi∣cation</HI>
(considering the many thousands in <HI>England,</HI>
who in the justifying thereof would have been ready
to have seconded them) but that both the <HI>War</HI> in
<HI>Ireland</HI> and that upon the <HI>Continent,</HI> would have
been carry'd on with more difficulty than they were,
and probably have terminated more unfortunately,
and with less honour, than they did. Nor is it to
be thought impossible, but that upon such a <HI>Decla∣ration,</HI>
the <HI>Scots</HI> might have obtained, those Terms
with reference to their Laws, Liberties, Privileges
and Religion from King <HI>James,</HI> and those so secu∣red
from Repeal and Alteration, as that they might
have been as happy as either at present they are, or
have reason to hope to be hereafter. For however
impossible it was, as our Author rightly accounts it,
for the <HI>Scots to have remain'd Neutral at the
time of the Revolution, considering the Party
within their Bowels, that was headed by Dun∣dee;</HI>
yet all Men who have not lost their Vnder∣standings,
must needs acknowledge, that they might
at that juncture have taken other Measures than
they did.</P>
<P>

<PB REF="14"/>
Nor can this <HI>Writer</HI> be any ways thought a
<HI>Politician,</HI> who seeks to represent it as a thing too
ridiculous to be imagin'd, <HI>That</HI> England <HI>could be
render'd obnoxious to Dangers, thro' the</HI> Scots
<HI>running into a Conjunction with</HI> France. For
tho' I do esteem him a very ill Man that wisheth it;
yet I cannot avoid reckoning him strangely unac∣quainted
with the State and Ballance of <HI>Europe,</HI>
that doth not foresee, how mischievous the Vnion of
these two Nations together might prove to this King∣dom,
notwithstanding both its own great Opulency
and Power, and its having the <HI>Dutch</HI> for its <HI>Al∣lies.</HI>
Of whose wonderful Friendship our <HI>East-India
Company</HI> hath had a late Experiment, thro' the
<HI>Holanders</HI> both supplanting them in effect in their
whole <HI>East-India Trade,</HI> and in the getting them to
be disgracefull <HI>Insulted</HI> by the <HI>Ministers</HI> and <HI>Of∣ficers</HI>
of the <HI>Mogul.</HI> For whereas that <HI>Monarch</HI>
being provoked by the Hostilities of European Pi∣rates,
would admit no Europeans to Traffick in his
Dominions, without their becoming obliged to cover
all his Ships and those of Subjects from those Rob∣bers:
The <HI>Dutch</HI> in the vertue of Bribes seasonably
bestowed, have procur'd the protection of the vast
Ocean Southward of <HI>Surat</HI> to be devolv'd upon the
<HI>English,</HI> (the performance whereof is altogether
impracticable, especially if the Suborners thereunto,
should not only Countenance the <HI>Piracy</HI> of others,
but think it convenient in order and subserviency to
their Interest to practice it on these Seas themselves)
while the whole which the <HI>Dutch</HI> have thought fit to
charge themselves with, is to protect the Commerce
to <HI>Mocca,</HI> in the Vndertaking whereof, they have
also a Prospect of acquiring other advantages over


<PB REF="15"/>
the <HI>English.</HI> But to return to the Author of
whose Performances I have been suggesting my
Thoughts. Would either my <HI>Temper,</HI> or my <HI>Prin∣ciples,</HI>
allow me to judge of another's Desires by
Consequences deducible from hasty and unwary Ex∣pressions,
I should be apt to suspect, that the Gentle∣man
would be glad to see the Experiment of the one
and the other that have been mentioned. Whereas I do
heartily pray, that neither the <HI>Scots</HI> may be so Trai∣terous
as to be guilty of the <HI>first;</HI> not the <HI>English</HI>
brought into the Circumstances of being expos'd to
the trial of the <HI>second.</HI></P>
<P>All that I shall further subjoyn for preparing the
<HI>Reader</HI> to the perusal of the following <HI>Discourse,</HI> is
briefly to let him know, that I do reckon what will
be there met with, to be no less either Needful or
Seasonable, in case the <HI>Scots</HI> have <HI>forsaken Darien,</HI>
than if they had continued still in the possession thereof;
or after their having once <HI>Abandon'd</HI> it, had again
<HI>Re-possess'd</HI> it. In that my business is to Justify
and Vindicate the Legality of their Design and At∣tempt
to Settle there, abstracting from the considera∣tion
whether their Vndertaking might be attended
with Success or Disappointment. And if what I have
represented and offer'd on that <HI>Head,</HI> be Perti∣nent
and Effectual for the Proving and Establishing
of what it is alledg'd and adduc'd for, it will not on∣ly
render their Condition the more Compassionable, on
the supposal of their having been unfortunate; but it
will both make their present Clamours and Resent∣ments
for their Loss, Calamity and Disgrace, the
less Surprizing and the more Pardonable, provided
they carry them no farther, than what is consistent
with their Fealty and Allegiance; and will shew the


<PB REF="15"/>
unkindness and neglect of those to have been the greater,
whether in the giving them Opposition, or in the refu∣sing
them Assistance, whose Favour and Aid they
might, on many accounts, have reasonably relied
upon with respect to the being Countenanced and Sup∣ported.
Not to add, that some will find themselves
extreamly mistaken in their <HI>Politicks,</HI> and perceive
their having been misled into wrong <HI>Measures;</HI> if
the Intelligence should prove true, which divers have
receiv'd, of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having accepted the <HI>Na∣val
Assistance</HI> of the <HI>French,</HI> for <HI>Driving</HI> the
<HI>Scots</HI> out of <HI>Darien,</HI> in case they be still there, and
on the supposal of their having left it, for the <HI>Co∣vering</HI>
all those <HI>Parts</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> over which the
<HI>Catholick King</HI> pretends a <HI>Soveraignty,</HI> tho' <HI>Un∣occupied</HI>
by any of his Subjects, from attempts of
that Nature upon them for the future by any of the
<HI>British</HI> Nations, or the Dominions thereunto belong∣ing.
Seeing that as <HI>Spains</HI> complying to receive the
Aid of the <HI>Marine</HI> Power of <HI>France,</HI> must argue
such an entireness of Friendship, and firmness of
Confidence between them, as can neither be comforta∣ble
nor safe to several <HI>Principalities</HI> and <HI>States</HI> in
<HI>Europe;</HI> so besides the Inconveniencies and Dama∣ges
which may thereupon befall other of His Maje∣sty's
<HI>Kingdoms,</HI> as well as <HI>Scotland;</HI> it is not im∣possible,
but that congruously as well as consequentially
to this, the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> may be willing to ad∣mit
of the Conjunction, Aid, and Assistance, of the
<HI>French</HI> in the <HI>Loan</HI> of their <HI>Land Forces,</HI> for the

belong, above the Contempt, and prove Service∣able

and reward the Labours, hazards and ex∣pences
of those, who do either personally, or
otherwise engage, associate and venture in the
beginning, promoting and defending a Corre∣spondence
and Commerce of this Nature.</P>
<P>For tho' there have been, and still are here
and there, a <HI>few</HI> that being formed <HI>ex meliore
luto,</HI> and who thro' having something distin∣guishing
and singular in their <HI>mechanical</HI> Frame,
Or thro' the being imbued with more exalted
and generous Principles either of Nature or of
Grace, then it is the Lot and Portion of many
any where to be, have upon <HI>Philosophical</HI> or up∣on
<HI>Religious motives,</HI> become Travellers, and
Voyagers into far distant and remote Coun∣tries;
yet as the ends under the view, and for
the compassing whereof, they have heretofore
undergone, and do hitherto subject themselves
to the toil, cost and dangers, which unavoid∣ably
attend and accompany such undertakings,
are either too speculative, and too much abstract∣ed
from things and matters, that affect our
Senses, and are beneficent, and gratifying to
the Animal life; or are of too elevated, spiri∣tual
and Celestial a Nature and Consideration,
to make an impression upon, and to byass and
govern any <HI>Large Number</HI> of those of great
Political Bodies, and National Societies; So
the Embarking thereinto, upon the forementi∣oned
single inducements and prospects, by some
Individuals, whose either natural Genius, or
their improvements in Divine Knowledge, and
the being furnished with more Christian zeal,


<PB N="4" REF="18"/>
and Supernatural grace, than most have arrived
unto, or are under the power of, does neither
amount nor bear proportion to the Notion and
<HI>Idea,</HI> which an <HI>Vniversal Correspondence</HI> between
and amongst those of all Regions signifieth and
imports. Nor will it answer the Exigencies
and Necessities, which the People of every Na∣tion
are less or more under, of having their
Superfluities Exported and of gaining those
things to be Imported, which they do either
wholly, or to very prejudicial Measures and De∣grees,
want and stand in need of.</P>
<P>So that it is not more obvious, than it may
be easily accounted for, how a <HI>Correspondence</HI> of
this or that State or Kingdom, with other Na∣tions
and Dominions, especially when far di∣stant,
and widely disjoyned from each other,
comes to be so little minded and practised,
save in order unto, conjunction with, and in
Subserviency to <HI>Traffick</HI> and <HI>Mercantile Com∣merce.</HI>
Nor do remarkable Numbers of any
people much love to Travel, or commonly do,
out of their own Native Regions and Terri∣tories,
tho' but into Neighbouring and adjoyn∣ing
Provinces, which may be effected with great
Safety, and at little expence, unless upon views
either of Subsisting better there, than they did
at home, or of qualifying themselves thro' an
acquisition of Arts and Sciences, or by the pro∣curing
Treasure, and Wealth, by means where∣of,
they may afterwards make a better <HI>Figure,</HI>
and live more comfortably and opulently in
their own Countries, than they were otherwise
likely to have done.</P>
<P>And whosoever alloweth himself liberty, and
vouchsafeth to take the pains, of observing the


<PB N="5" REF="18"/>
present <HI>State</HI> and <HI>Balance</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> with the va∣rious
and different conditions of the several
Territories, Jurisdictions and Dominions thereof,
will soon discern and understand, why every
People whose <HI>Country</HI> lies situated, and whose
either Soil or Industry may furnish them with
<HI>Materials</HI> for <HI>Trade,</HI> should account it their <HI>In∣terest</HI>
and make it the <HI>Scope</HI> and <HI>Design</HI> of their
Skill and Labour, to <HI>cultivate</HI> and <HI>pursue Naviga∣tion</HI>
and <HI>Foreign Traffick;</HI> seeing the great Ad∣vantage,
whether with respect to Power or to
Wealth, which this or that <HI>European Country</HI>
and <HI>Nation</HI> have above and beyond <HI>others,</HI> is
mostly, if not altogether, owing and ascribable
unto the extent and measure of their <HI>Naviga∣tion</HI>
and <HI>Traffick.</HI> For as it is principally this
that attracteth and draweth large swarms of
Industrious people to Countries and Territories,
where the Natives and such as did Inhabit there
before, were but few; so in proportion to the
encrease of people, and their application to
Commerce, there do necessarily ensue Enlarge∣ment
of Agriculture, Augmentation of Manu∣facture,
the venting of Natural as well as of
Artificial productions, and thereby a growth in
Wealth and Treasure, and consequently there∣unto,
an advancement in the value and price of
Lands.</P>
<P>But because the main design, as well as the
necessary brevity of this Discourse, will not
allow place nor room, for the arguing of this
according to the worth, and importance of
the Subject, I shall therefore choose at once, both
to prove and to illustrate it from and by un∣controulable
matter of <HI>Fact.</HI> Nor have we occa∣sion
to go far for a convincing Instance and


<PB N="6" REF="19"/>
Evidence of it: Forasmuch as we need no other
demonstration of the many <HI>Benefits</HI> that Natu∣rally
result from <HI>Trade,</HI> than to consider how
our Neighbours, the <HI>Dutch,</HI> are hereby become
<HI>Populous, Wealthy</HI> and <HI>Powerful.</HI> It being appa∣rent,
beyond possibility of being rationally de∣nied,
or contradicted, that notwithstanding the
Unhealthfulness of their Air, the Brackish∣ness
of their Waters, the Badness of their Ports,
the Scarcity of their Natural Productions, the
Narrowness of their Territories, and the vast
Expence, which they are indispensibly obliged
unto, for the covering and defending themselves,
and their Country from the Inundations of the
Sea; yet that upon the motive and encourage∣ment
of the Profits and Advantages arising by
<HI>Trade,</HI> they have drawn many of the most La∣borious
and Ingenious people of all Neighbour∣ing
Countries into their <HI>Provinces;</HI> so that from
a scanty number of Original <HI>Natives,</HI> and pri∣mitive
<HI>Inhabitants,</HI> they are increased into such
a Multitude, that no Nation without Traffick,
and that is confined to there narrow dimensions
of Lands and Territories, maketh an approach
unto, and much less equalleth. And all these by
accruements from Navigation and Commerce, are
not only by reason of their Riches and Wealth, be∣come
the objects of the envy of such as live about
them; but the <HI>Heads, Governours</HI> and Supreame
<HI>Rulers</HI> of that Republick, are risen from Poor
Weak Supplicant and Despised <HI>States,</HI> to the
making of such a <HI>Figure</HI> in the World, that ful∣ly
and amply answereth the <HI>Lofty Title,</HI> which
they have assumed unto themselves, of <HI>High</HI>
and <HI>Mighty.</HI></P>
<P>

<PB N="7" REF="19"/>
Nor is it unworthy of remark, that the
<HI>English,</HI> whose Genius disposeth and inclineth
them, and whose <HI>Situation, Ports, Natural Pro∣ductions,</HI>
and Manufactures, give them incompara∣ble
Advantages for Foreign <HI>Traffick</HI> and Commerce,
beyond what the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> with respect to all
and every one of these recited particulars are
possessed of, and furnished with, and that the said
<HI>English</HI> have for above a <HI>Century</HI> of Years apply∣ed
themselves unto <HI>Trade,</HI> with Industry, Zeal,
and Success, beyond what most of their <HI>Euro∣pean</HI>
Neighbours can pretend to have done;
yet even They are greatly exceeded by the <HI>Dutch</HI>
(allowing for the dimensions of their Territo∣ries)
both in <HI>Number</HI> of <HI>People,</HI> and in the <HI>Opu∣lency</HI>
of <HI>Private</HI> Dealers, as well as of their
<HI>States.</HI> And this meerly by a more intense,
and <HI>Vniversal Cultivation</HI> of <HI>Commerce,</HI> and by the
Wise conduct of their <HI>Government</HI> in the ma∣king
the <HI>Export</HI> and <HI>Import</HI> of their Goods, and
Commodities <HI>Moderate</HI> and <HI>Easy,</HI> under all the
Exigencies and Necessities of the <HI>State,</HI> and a
proportionable Imposition upon, and Exaction
from the Subject. For whereas the <HI>Dutch</HI> (as
is well observed by that Excellent and
Sagacious Author <HI>of an Essay upon ways
and Means)</HI> having in all their Provin∣ces
only <HI>about Eight Millions of Acres,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Essay upon the pro∣bable methods of ma∣king a people <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ainers in the balance of <HI>Trade.</HI> p. 37.</NOTE> do
entertain, employ, and comfortably Sub∣sist
near <HI>three Millions</HI> of People, yet
<HI>England</HI> notwithstanding all the forementioned
Advantages, for <HI>Traffick</HI> beyond and above them,
and its having in Land <HI>more than Thirty Nine
Millions of Acres,</HI> is not reckoned to have above
<HI>Six Millions of People,</HI> which upon a balance, and
an adjustment of our extent of Ground and


<PB N="8" REF="20"/>
theirs, makes them to exceed us more than
in a Moyety of Inhabitants.</P>
<P>And as they have in the vertue of, Results
from, and natural Consequences upon there ap∣plication

unto a Naval strength, which makes
them <HI>Superiour</HI> in <HI>Marine Power</HI> to most <HI>Nations,</HI>

of the <HI>Seas;</HI> so they are grown able thro' the
<HI>Treasure,</HI> which they have acquired by <HI>Traffick</HI>
and <HI>Commerce,</HI> to procure, raise, and muster, <HI>such
Numerous Forces,</HI> out of distant, as well as out
of adjoyning Countries (where the want and
poverty not only of Subjects, but of Princes
tempteth the <HI>Latter</HI> upon the baite and bribe
of Pensions, to grant and afford them what pro∣portion
of Troops they do require, and com∣pelleth
the former upon the hopes of a Pay,
that will hardly yield them Food, to be willing,
and ready to serve under their Banner) as
thereby to be in a Condition to undertake,
carry on, and manage both <HI>Offensive</HI> and <HI>De∣fensive
Wars</HI> against the greatest Potentates,
and the Powerfullest Nations in <HI>Europe.</HI> For
as it is with great Judgment, and an accurate re∣gard
to Truth, observed by the most Ingenious Au∣thor
of <HI>an Essay, upon waies and means,</HI> that <HI>no
Sums dug out of Mines, bear any proportion with
what may be made to rise, by the Labour and Traf∣fick
of a Trading and Industrious people:</HI> So it
is no less <HI>Morally</HI> and Politically certain, than
any <HI>Problem</HI> in <HI>Euclid</HI> is <HI>Mathematically,</HI> that in
proportion to the Riches and Treasures which
a people is possessed of, they may be powerful
(if they please) by Land as well as by Sea.
Whereas such Nations, who do either because


<PB N="9" REF="20"/>
of their distance from <HI>Navigable Waters</HI> stand
<HI>Incapacitated</HI> and <HI>Disabled</HI> for all <HI>Maritime Traf∣fick,</HI>
or who by reason of their <HI>Carelesness,</HI> and
<HI>Sloth,</HI> do not <HI>Apply</HI> themselves unto it, with that
Industry which they should, are notwithstand∣ing
their larger, as well as their equal extent of
<HI>Territories,</HI> with them whom we have mention'd,
not only unable to support and sustain a full
complement of People, in proportion to the
dimensions of their Land, but tho' possibly
through the Largeness of their Ground, they be
overstockt with Inhabitants, beyond what some
Trading Countries are, nevertheless they are un∣capable
of Maintaining even a <HI>Land War</HI> (especi∣ally
if it be offensive) for so long a time, and
with so much Reputation and Honour, as a
Kingdom or State addicted unto <HI>Traffick</HI> and
<HI>Commerce,</HI> are experimentally found to be in a
condition to do. Whereof I need not assign In∣stances,
there being several large Dominions,
and considerable Republicks in <HI>Europe,</HI> which
are undeniable and convincing proofs of it,
and particularly even <HI>Germany,</HI> as well as
<HI>Switzerland:</HI> who notwithstanding their great
Numbers both of Men and of Disciplined
Troops, and their inclination unto, and Bra∣vour
in War, yet thro' their being straitned and
scanted in <HI>Money,</HI> which is a Natural and una∣voidable
<HI>Consequence</HI> of their <HI>Want</HI> of <HI>Traffick,</HI>
they are neither in a condition to bring such
Numerous <HI>Armies</HI> into the <HI>Field,</HI> nor for any
long time to <HI>Maintain</HI> them <HI>there,</HI> as such <HI>Nati∣ons</HI>
who are stored with Treasure, as the

and often do.</P>
<P>

<PB N="10" REF="21"/>
But that which in a most especial manner,
should awaken and oblige every Nation, that
lies <HI>Situated,</HI> and is provided with Necessaries
and conveniencies for <HI>Trade,</HI> to undertake, cul∣tivate
and promote it, is seriously to weigh
and consider, what our <HI>Neighbours</HI> who have
commodious <HI>Ports</HI> for <HI>Navigation,</HI> and <HI>Natural</HI>
and <HI>Artificial Productions,</HI> to be both the Source
Original and Foundation, and the Nerves and
Supports of it, have been of late and are still
industriously doing. Namely that the acquisi∣tion
and enlargement of <HI>Trade,</HI> is the great Stu∣dy
and endeavours of most Princes and States,
the adjacency of whose Territories to the Sea,
the growth of their Soil, and the Manufa∣ctures
of their Subjects do in any measure make
it practicable, and give hopes of succeeding and
prospering in it. Particularly that Powerful
and wise <HI>Monarch</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> no less to his
own <HI>Glory</HI> than the <HI>Benefit</HI> of his <HI>Dominions,</HI>
makes it the chief business of his Royal care and
Authority, to encourage advance and protect
it. Tho' of all Potentates and people whatso∣ever,
the <HI>French King</HI> and his <HI>Subjects</HI> are in
the best condition to subsist comfortably with∣out
it. And that by reason of their enjoying not
only within themselves and at home, <HI>all things</HI>
that are absolutely <HI>Necessary</HI> and <HI>Requisite</HI> for
the pleasure, as well as for the Sustentation of
life, but because of their having so many and
such <HI>Valuable Superfluities,</HI> which others do Ex∣port
from them, for which they do both furnish
them in way of Exchange, with those few con∣veniencies,
they do want, and do enrich them
with Treasure, by paying them in Gold and
Silver, for most part of the Goods and Commodi∣ties


<PB N="11" REF="21"/>
that they purchase of, and import into their
own Countries from them.</P>
<P>And indeed what that <HI>Prince,</HI> hath effected
and done within the <HI>compass</HI> of a <HI>few years,</HI> and
the narrow <HI>Circle</HI> of his own <HI>Reign,</HI> in the en∣couraging
and promoting <HI>Manufactures</HI> at <HI>Home,</HI>
the extending and enlarging <HI>Traffick</HI> into all
Countries, tho' at never so great a distance
<HI>Abroad,</HI> notwithstanding the Natural aversion,
as well as the long contracted indisposition of
his people thereunto, thro' Humour, Genius and
Custom, and his having raised and furnished
himself with a <HI>Naval Power,</HI> which for Num∣ber
and Strength of <HI>Ships,</HI> is not only in a Con∣dition
to protect his <HI>Commerce,</HI> and defend his
Kingdom against Invasions by <HI>Sea;</HI> but to dis∣pute
the very Dominion of the Ocean with
those, who have long laid claim unto, and ho∣norably
maintained it; I say that the great en∣couragement
which he hath given, and the stu∣pendious
advancement that he hath made in all
these, do cloath and adorn him with greater
Honour while he liveth, and will transmit his
Name hereafter to Posterity, with a more daz∣ling
Lustre and Splendour, than either all his
Victories and Conquests heretofore, or his late
sustaining so long a War, without any con∣siderable
Mortification and disgrace to himself,
or momentons prejudice or damage to his
People. And whosoever will give themselves
leave to think, and are withal qualified to pene∣trate
into the Springs, Reasons, and proper
causes of Matters and Affairs of this nature, will
easily find and perceive, that there is nothing
has so much laid the Foundation of his vast
Power and Strength of Military Forces at Land,


<PB N="12" REF="22"/>
and of his Ability to maintain and support them,
without either their Deserting or their Mutiny∣ing
thro' want of Food, Rayment and Pay;
and of all the Successes which he hath attain'd
unto by means of their Bravour and Discipline,
as his <HI>Manufactures</HI> at home, and his <HI>Commerce</HI>
abroad have done, from and by which most of
that great <HI>Wealth</HI> and <HI>Treasure</HI> hath <HI>flowed</HI> in
to him, in the Vertue whereof these things
became practicable and have been accom∣plished.</P>
<P>For I do reckon there is nothing more de∣monstrable,
than that the <HI>French King</HI> is chiefly
indebted to the Profits and Emoluments, which
have arisen by Manufacture and Trade, for all
that during the late War he hath been enabled
to do both offensively and defensively. And
while others do amuse and triflingly employ
themselves, and impertinently and uselessly
squander away their time, in loading their
Memories with naked and insignificant accounts
and <HI>Memoirs</HI> of the <HI>Military Facts</HI> of that <HI>Mo∣narch,</HI>
and of those Confederated against him,
which were transacted here and there, during
the late bloody expensive and tedious War: I
am not ashamed to declare my self one, who
am rather willing to enquire into, represent and
to recommend, the Springs, Originals and Foun∣dations,
upon which that <HI>Potentate</HI> was in a
condition to support and manage so long a
War, with so much Reputation to himself, and
safety to his Territories and People. And I do
presume to affirm, that the main Sources and
fundamental means hereof, were his former ac∣quisition
of Wealth, and a continued accession
and accruement of new <HI>Treasure</HI> by <HI>Manufacture</HI>


<PB N="13" REF="22"/>
and <HI>Trade.</HI> It being thereby alone, that so
large a <HI>Quota</HI> and Portion of the Gold and Sil∣ver
dug out of the <HI>Spanish Mines</HI> of <HI>America,</HI>
and of what of the former is gathered in <HI>Africa,</HI>
hath either by shorter and more expeditious
steps, or after longer and wider strides flowed
into, <HI>France,</HI> and thereupon in the Course of
Circulation there, hath come at last to be so
plentifully lodged in that <HI>Princes Exchequer.</HI> So
that it is into <HI>Trade</HI> and the <HI>product</HI> thereof, that
we are principally to resolve the <HI>French King</HI>'s
having been not only able during the last War,
to cover and protect himself from dishonour,
and his Kingdom from Ravage and Impoverish∣ment,
by the irruption of the Troops of the
Allies into his Provinces, their destruction of
his Cities and Towns, or the pillaging of his
Subjects to a measure and degree, that counter∣vailed
the attempting, and executing any thing
of that kind, but his having been victorious in
several Battles, successful in the Conquest of di∣vers
strong Holds and Fortifyed places, that were
thought by some to be impregnable; and the
rendring himself Master of large and rich Pro∣vinces,
whose Situation and Remoteness, were
thought Sufficient to have covered them, from
being insulted, and much more to have made it
impossible to have subdued them, and all this a∣gainst
such a plurality of Confederate <HI>Allies,</HI>
and the greatest, strongest, most numerous and
best disciplined united <HI>Forces</HI> that were ever
known in this part of the World, to have ce∣mented
and Joyned against <HI>One Prince</HI> and single
Kingdom.</P>
<P>Now I have the more particularly mentioned
this, not that any should thereby be provoked


<PB N="14" REF="23"/>
to complain of, or to blame that <HI>Monarch</HI> be∣cause
of his employing his Princely solicitude
for, and <HI>exercising</HI> his <HI>Royal Authority</HI> over his
People, in commanding as well as encouraging
their application unto <HI>Manufacture</HI> and <HI>Trade;</HI>
but that his example may be both a Pattern and
a motive unto every Nation to enter upon, and,
to pursue the same ways and methods, that is
any wise qualified for, and capable of doing it.
And especially that they would engage therein
with zeal and Industry, unto whom upon the
advantages, which will redound and accrue to
him, thro' his Subjects improving in Manufa∣ctures,
and in the enlargement and encrease of
their Traffick, he may be reason of his Neigh∣bourhood
become hereafter a more dreadful E∣nemy
than ever he yet was. For tho' neither
our uneasiness, upon the aforementioned Account
for the present, nor our too Just fears of what
may overtake and befall us in time to come,
can Justify either our being offended with,
or our speaking undecently of the <HI>French</HI> King,
but will only betray and discover our Folly,
Ill nature and want of Breeding; yet it will
both become the Wisdom, and prove the In∣terest
of the <HI>People</HI> of <HI>England</HI> whom He is a∣bout
<HI>Rivalling</HI> in <HI>Commerce,</HI> as well as in <HI>Naval
strength,</HI> to make it more their care and en∣deavours
to exceed him in each of those. And
it is and will be every day more and more
the great concern of the <HI>Scots,</HI> to emulate and
imitate him in these particulars, as far and as
much as they can. And were He at present in

<P>Nor can it Justly administer offence to any

that the more the <HI>French</HI> do cultivate and pro∣mote

his <HI>Majesty</HI> nor the <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>England</HI>

to disturb, or to obstruct them in their
<HI>Commerce</HI> without some previous Infraction on
their part of the <HI>Treaty</HI> of <HI>Reswick:</HI> The more
it should be the <HI>Princely care</HI> of the <HI>King</HI> of
<HI>Great Britain,</HI> and the sedulous and prudenti∣al
<HI>Study</HI> and <HI>endeavour</HI> of an <HI>English Parliament</HI>
and <HI>People,</HI> that the <HI>Scots,</HI> who being under the
same <HI>Prince,</HI> that they are, and thereupon so
Confederated and linked together, as to have
the same Friends and Enemies, may both have
the Advice, Councel, and Countenance of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
to encourage them unto, and the Aid and
Assistance of their Treasure, and Strength and
Power to uphold and protect them in <HI>Trade.</HI>
For seeing <HI>Traffick</HI> is the <HI>Spring</HI> and <HI>Fountain</HI> of
<HI>Wealth,</HI> and that Nations encrease in <HI>Riches</HI> in
proportion to the Kind and Degrees of their
Manufacture, and the Quality and Extent of
their Commerce; It naturally followeth that it
is both the Interest and Duty of these Kingdoms
mutually to further, and support one another,
who being Subjects under one and the same So∣veraign,
are knit and united together by a stron∣ger
Cement, and by more firm and indissoluble
Tyes, than Countries under distinct and diffe∣rent
Princes, are capable of being made by Alli∣ances
and Leagues, how publickly soever con∣tracted


<PB N="16" REF="24"/>
and stipulated, and solemnly ratified and
confirmed. Nor will it I suppose be denyed,
but that according to the <HI>Share</HI> which <HI>England</HI>
and <HI>Scotland</HI> shall acquire and obtain of the
Trade of the World, the <HI>Less</HI> will fall to the
<HI>Portion</HI> of the <HI>French,</HI> and the Less vent they
will have, as well every where for their own
Natural and Artificial productions, as for what
they do Import from Foreign and remote pla∣ces.</P>
<P>Nor can it be reasonably contradicted, but
that <HI>Scotland</HI> hath been expos'd and stood liable
to many <HI>Inconveniences</HI> and <HI>Prejudices</HI> by it's ha∣ving
so long and greatly neglected <HI>Manufacture</HI>
and <HI>Trade,</HI> as it hath imprudently and supine∣ly
done. And had not they of that Nation,
given undeniable proofs in divers other ways
and Instances of their being a Sagacious and
Wise, and a Laborious and Industrious peo∣ple;
such of some other Kingdoms who assume
a great Licentiousness in rallying upon the de∣fects
and imperfections of those of other Coun∣tries,
than their own, might as Justly reflect
upon the <HI>Laziness</HI> of the <HI>Scots,</HI> and their <HI>defici∣ency</HI>
in <HI>Prudence,</HI> and <HI>good Sence,</HI> as they do with
insolence and unmannerliness enough, upbraid
them with their Poverty. But as this is
a very tender Subject, I shall handle it with
such gentleness, that none of the Kingdom of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> shall have cause to be offended: For as
much as my only design herein is, to represent
the Benefits which will arise to them, by their
present undertaking, and to commend their en∣gaging,
as well as to encourage their perse∣vering
in it, but not to reflect with any Se∣verity
upon their omissions heretofore in this
matter.</P>
<P>

<PB N="17" REF="24"/>
And I suppose it will be readily acknow∣leged,
by all Men that are capable of thinking
accurately, and to useful purposes, that it is not
the <HI>Largeness</HI> of <HI>Territory,</HI> that makes a <HI>Country
Strong</HI> and <HI>Powerful,</HI> but the great and plentiful
Number of People, and consequently that the
neglecting of such means and Methods, as would
be effectual motives to prevail upon such as are
Born and Bred in a Nation to continue in it,
or to go no where but in prospect of, and in
Subserviency unto the prosperity of their Na∣tive
Land, must unavoidably cause a Nation
to be Weak, notwithstanding the vast Multi∣tudes,
that may have been Born, and for some
years brought up in it; which I presume will
be confessed to have been hitherto the case
of the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in that so large
Numbers of people of great Ingenuity of mind,
and of bodily strength and agility, equal to those
of any Country about them, have through the
difficulties they were under of living comforta∣bly
at home, which proceeded from Neglect and
want of <HI>Manufacture</HI> and <HI>Trade,</HI> been Necessitated,
as well as Tempted, to seek their Fortunes, and
to endeavour to gain a livelyhood elsewhere.</P>
<P>Whereunto may be added, That as it is not
meerly because of the having a great Number of
People, that a Nation is rendred Prosperous and
Happy, but thro' the having them usefully em∣ployed,
which it is impossible they should be,
without <HI>Manufacture</HI> and <HI>Traffick,</HI> and therefore
that where there is none or very little Trade,
a Nation is even made Obnoxious, and doth be∣come
liable to Calamities and Desolations, by
the greater <HI>Complement</HI> and <HI>Number</HI> it hath of
<HI>Inhabitants.</HI> Seeing in such years as are not


<PB N="18" REF="25"/>
Seasonable for Grain, wherein that of the Poet
obtains of <HI>Spem mentita seges, the Corn doth not
answer the hope and expectation of the Husbandman;</HI>
The greater that the <HI>Number</HI> of the <HI>People</HI> is, they
must be subject the more to <HI>Famine,</HI> and Multitudes
of them exposed to <HI>Starve.</HI> Whereof there needs
no other proof, than what that Country hath
for these two or three last years afforded us.
For tho' it is by reason of <HI>Trade,</HI> being become
more diffused and universal in the World, than
it Anciently was, by means whereof the Indi∣gency
of one Country, is supplyed out of the
Abundance and Plenty of another, that <HI>Famines</HI>
of late Ages are neither so frequent nor so Fa∣tal
as of Old they used to be; yet in proporti∣on
to the Scarcity and Want that there is of
Money in any Nation, which must necessarily be
answerable to the littleness of their Manufa∣ctures,
and the meanness of their Commerce, Fa∣mines
will both fall out the oftner there, and
prove the more destructive. Seeing by the same
reason, that the <HI>Poor</HI> in any Country, are in a
time of scarcity more Obnoxious to Starving,
than such as are <HI>Rich:</HI> A <HI>Nation</HI> that is <HI>Necessi∣tous</HI>
must be more exposed and subject to <HI>Fa∣mines</HI>
and to Devastations by them, than King∣domes
and Provinces which are Wealthy and
Opulent stand liable unto.</P>
<P>Yea where <HI>Trade</HI> is not encouraged and pro∣moted,
even <HI>Agriculture</HI> it self will be much
neglected, tho' it be the chief, if not the on∣ly
means, whereby the Inhabitants do Subsist.
Because that as thro' the Scarcity of Money, and
the Poverty thereunto annexed, which as I
have often intimated, will always both accom∣pany,
and be proportionable to the want of


<PB N="19" REF="25"/>
Manufacture and Commerce, there will never
be a sufficient <HI>Complement</HI> of <HI>People</HI> to <HI>Cultivate</HI>
all the <HI>Ground,</HI> that is capable of being <HI>Ma∣nured,</HI>
but that much of it must be left <HI>Barren:</HI>
So the price of <HI>Grain</HI> and of Fatted <HI>Cattle,</HI> be∣ing
generally in proportion to the <HI>Wealth,</HI> and
<HI>Treasure</HI> that a <HI>Nation</HI> is possessed of, the <HI>Rates</HI>
of those will run too low, for <HI>Husbandmen</HI> to
be encouraged and enabled, to make such im∣provements
even of their <HI>Agriculted</HI> Lands, as
they might by Expence upon them be brought
unto. Which brief hint and suggestion, I do
leave and referr unto the consideration of those
who do live in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who must know better
than I pretend to do, how little their best
Lands are improved to what they are capa∣ble
of being, and how much Ground doth
lie wholly barren, by reason of the want of a
sufficient Number of People, and of the defi∣ciency
in Riches of those the Nation is stockt
with, to take it in and cultivate it.</P>
<P>Whereas it is obvious what great enlarge∣ments
are made in the <HI>Agriculture,</HI> and Pastu∣rage
of <HI>England</HI> beyond what formerly was,
and to what high Prizes in comparison of that
which they bore before, <HI>Corn</HI> and <HI>Cattle</HI> are
advanced, since the <HI>Application</HI> of the <HI>English</HI> to
<HI>Trade.</HI> Nor is it to be doubted, but that as they
extend their <HI>Traffick,</HI> and become thereby far∣ther
enriched, there will be a proportionable
progress made in the taking in and rendring
those Lands fertile which remain hitherto Bar∣ren,
and in the encrease of the Price of those which
are already cultivated. Nor may it be amiss un∣der
this head further to represent, that it is be∣cause
of the <HI>Scots</HI> having neglected <HI>Manufa∣ctture</HI>


<PB N="20" REF="26"/>
and <HI>Trade,</HI> that the general Rental of that
Kingdom, and the <HI>Value</HI> of <HI>Lands</HI> when <HI>Far∣med,</HI>
are even for the <HI>Dmiension</HI> of <HI>Territory</HI> and
<HI>Ground,</HI> so much Disproportionable unto, and be∣low
what they are in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland.</HI> Nor
can any Mathematical proposition be more evi∣dent
and certain, upon the indubitable princi∣ples
of that Science, than it is sure and un∣questionable
both from <HI>Moral Arguments</HI> and
<HI>Experience,</HI> that the current <HI>Worth</HI> of <HI>Land</HI> to
be <HI>Let</HI> will be always according to the <HI>Measure</HI>
of <HI>Manufacture</HI> and <HI>Trade,</HI> and in proportion
to the <HI>Riches</HI> which a Nation by that means be∣comes
possessed of. In confirmation whereof,
it may not be unseasonable to take notice, how
that answerably to <HI>England</HI>'s enlarging its <HI>Ma∣nufacture,</HI>
and extending its <HI>Trade,</HI> the value of
<HI>Lands</HI> hath in equality thereunto gradually risen
and swelled. So that from <HI>Twelve years</HI> purchase,
which was the highest that <HI>Land</HI> went at about
the middle of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Reign, when
this <HI>Nation</HI> began first to apply it self conside∣rably
to <HI>Commerce,</HI> it was risen and advanced some
time ago to <HI>Twenty Years</HI> Purchase, and in several
places of the Kingdom to more.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Essay upon probable Methods of making a people gainers in the Balance of <HI>Trade. p.</HI> 77.</NOTE> For as
the Admirable <HI>Author</HI> of an <HI>Essay on Ways
and Means</HI> doth most pertinently observe,
and confidently affirm, <HI>That there are
undeniable reasons to be given, that the gene∣ral
Rental of</HI> England <HI>did not in the year
1600 exceed Six Millions</HI> per annum, <HI>but that
thro' the help of that Wealth, which had flowed into
the Kingdom by Foreign Trade, it had risen before
the commencement of the late War, to Fourteen
Millions Yearly;</HI> So none will have the Effronte∣ry
to gainsay, but that the <HI>Rental</HI> of <HI>England,</HI>


<PB N="21" REF="26"/>
was the year 1600 greatly encreased beyond,
what it had been about half a Century before.
Which the more it is seriously weighed, and
duly pondred by the Nobility and Gentry of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> it will not only both Justifie their
Wisdom in procuring an <HI>Act of Parliament,
for Trading to Africa</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> and in
their having joyned so freely, and contributed
so Liberally, for the forming a <HI>Stock,</HI> and rai∣sing
a <HI>Treasure,</HI> that may be sufficient as well
to Uphold, and Promote as to Begin it, but
it may also animate their Zeal, and raise their
Courage for the Maintaining and Protecting
of it.</P>
<P>But to shut up this particular, it is to be
ascribed to the neglect of <HI>Trade,</HI> and their
falling below their Neighbours in <HI>Riches</HI> and
<HI>Treasure,</HI> which is the Natural effect of that
Omission, that <HI>Scotland</HI> is not only so weak as
it is in a <HI>Naval Strength,</HI> notwithstanding the
variety, goodness and conveniency of its <HI>Ports,</HI>
for the <HI>Ocean</HI> and <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> as well as for
the <HI>Narrow Seas,</HI> and the <HI>Baltick,</HI> but that the
<HI>Nation</HI> doth make so mean and inconsiderable
a <HI>Figure</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> and that the <HI>Scots</HI> Nobility
and Gentry, who for their Natural and acqui∣red
accomplishments do equal most of any
Country that are of their Rank and Quality,
and who for Bravour are Universally acknow∣ledged
to Come behind few or none, are never∣theless
so little Valued and Caressed by Princes,
and in Courts, by whom and where persons
are chiefly esteemed, according to their weight
in the balance of an Exchequer, and in propor∣tion
to their Rental and Capital.</P>

But the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> being at last
willing and desirous to redeem it self from
the <HI>Opprobry</HI> and <HI>Reproach,</HI> unto which it hath
so long stood exposed among its Neighbours,
for the having either thro' Supineness or Pride,
neglected the promoting and pursuing <HI>Manu∣facture</HI>
and <HI>Trade,</HI> and being now Embarked in
an Undertaking, that will relieve that Nation
against, and rescue it from the Inconveniencies
and Damages, which have ensued upon, and
accompanied their <HI>Omission</HI> of <HI>Commerce,</HI> it may
not be here improper to represent in a few
words the several advantages that <HI>Scotland</HI> is
possessed of, and doth enjoy in equality with
most Countries, and above divers, for its be∣ing
qualified and enabled to succeed and pro∣sper
in this Design. For the main and great
things that are Antecedently needfull, and pre∣required,
in order to a peoples engaging in
<HI>Manufacture</HI> at home, and <HI>Commerce</HI> abroad,
being large Numbers of Men and Women, and
a Soil producing variety and plenty of use∣full
Commodities, and convenient Ports for the
Exportation of their own Commodities, and the
Importation of such goods from Foreign parts,
as they shall have either occasion to consume a∣mongst
themselves, or which by carrying them
forth again, they can dispose of and vend else
where; there are few <HI>Nations</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> that
are better furnished and accommodated with
all those advantages, helps and Succours than
<HI>Scotland</HI> is. Seeing besides its having divers
<HI>Harbours,</HI> and those both safe and convenient∣ly
Situated, for Sailing to and from the Ea∣stern,
Southern and Western parts of the
World; It hath likewise diverse <HI>Natural Pro∣ductions,</HI>


<PB N="23" REF="27"/>
and may have a sufficient plenty of
<HI>Artifici<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l,</HI> to give an <HI>Original</HI> unto, and be
both a <HI>Foundation</HI> and <HI>Nourishment</HI> for Trade:
Nor will any deny but that it actually doth,
or may at least speedily so abound with Peo∣ple,
as to yield and afford hands enough for
<HI>Manufacture</HI> and <HI>Traffick.</HI></P>
<P>For tho' I do acknowledge, that <HI>Gold</HI> and
<HI>Silver</HI> with which the <HI>Scots,</HI> may probably be but
indifferently and scantily furnished (whereof ne∣vertheless
they may in time by this means ac∣quire
more) be the measure of Trade; yet
nothing is more certain, than that the <HI>Natural</HI>
and <HI>Artificial Products</HI> of a Country are the
<HI>Spring</HI> and <HI>Source</HI> of it; and that the <HI>Nerves</HI>
and <HI>Sinews</HI> thereof are a <HI>Multiplicity</HI> of <HI>Hands</HI>
properly and industriously employed. And with
these <HI>Scotland</HI> doth so abound, that many have
not only been, and still are thro' want of bu∣siness
and labour whereunto to apply them∣selves,
an useless and a grievous Burthen to
their Native Country: but great Numbers
have by their Necessities been constrained ei∣ther
to Transport themselves into the Colonies
and Plantations of other Nations, or to serve
Foreign Princes and States in the Wars, which
they have been carrying on against one ano∣ther,
in neither of which ways, hath any <HI>Bene∣fit
accrued</HI> to the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> nor is
it possible that it should, unless now and then
casually and by accident. But those Colonies,
where they have planted, do carry away and
engross the Gains of their Industry: And the
Potentates under whose Banners they bear
Arms, do reap the Glory of their Bravour,
and do become possessed of those acquisitions


<PB N="24" REF="28"/>
of Towns and Provinces, which they purchase
at the expence of their Blood and Lives,</P>
<P>And may I be permitted, without giving of∣fence,
to add, That thro' the latter of these
Methods, <HI>Scotland</HI> hath had the Misfortune, to
have more Thousands of lusty and valiant Men
kill'd and destroy'd in Wars, wherein that King∣dom
had no National concern, that if they had
been employ'd in the gentle and peaceable <HI>Arts</HI>
of <HI>Manufacture</HI> and <HI>Trade,</HI> would have been
sufficient to have render'd it a powerful and
opulent Nation. Yea, such has been the guilt,
as well as the unhappiness, of those, who thro'
want of Business, to give them a Subsistence
and Livelihood at Home, have betaken them∣selves
to the carrying Arms under Foreign Ru∣lers
and Potentates; that they have not only
been frequently engag'd in the killing of others,
and expos'd to be kill'd themselves, when and
where the alone cause of the War, hath too
often been m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erly, either the Covetousness,
Pride and Ambition of the Aggressors, or the
Fraudulencies, and Injustices of the Aggressed:
But, that to the disgrace of the Christian Reli∣gion,
and the infamy of their Country, they
have, many times, in Opposite and Hostile Bri∣gades
and Battalions, been found Encountring
and Slaughtring one another. So that for the
obviating, preventing, and avoiding, that Cri∣minal
and Reproachful Course for the future,
if upon no other Prospects and Motives, that
Kingdom ought to apply it self more to <HI>Manu∣facture</HI>
and <HI>Trade</HI> than it hath hitherto done.</P>
<P>For which that Nation stands not only ex∣ceedingly
adapted, by reason both of the <HI>Saga∣city</HI>
of their <HI>Nobility</HI> and <HI>Higher Gentry,</HI> for the


<PB N="25" REF="28"/>
discerning and advising unto Means, Ways,
and Methods, for the encouraging, encreasing,
and maintaining thereof; and of the <HI>Mercan∣tile
Knowledge, Skill,</HI> and <HI>Artifice,</HI> of those of

and managing, as well what is to be <HI>Fabricked</HI> at
<HI>Home,</HI> as what is to be chiefly <HI>Regarded</HI> and Cul∣tivated
abroad: But especially, because of its
having, with respect to the <HI>Number</HI> of its <HI>Peo∣ple,</HI>
a vaster <HI>Proportion</HI> of those that are of the
<HI>Poorer</HI> and <HI>Inferiour Sort,</HI> than some other Coun∣tries
are furnish'd with. Nor is any thing
more demonstrable, than that a multiplicity of
Nobility and Gentry, without a very large Num∣ber
of <HI>Commonalty,</HI> and of such as are <HI>Necessitous</HI>
and <HI>Indigent</HI> to very considerable measures and
degrees, is rather an <HI>Obstruction</HI> unto, than a

tho' the former may assist towards the find∣ing

afford and advance the <HI>Treasure</HI> that is necessary
to the Managing, Upholding, and the Enlarg∣ing

do mainly afford the Hands, by whose Toyl,
Labour, and Industry, the Production of the
<HI>Waters</HI> is <HI>gain'd,</HI> the <HI>growth</HI> of the <HI>Land</HI> is <HI>Fa∣brick'd</HI>

that <HI>Multitudes</HI> of <HI>People</HI> are the most valuable
<HI>Treasure,</HI> as well as the greatest <HI>Strength</HI> of a

and <HI>ordinary Sort,</HI> and such as are reckon'd
for the <HI>Mobb</HI> and Commonalty, provided they be

universally and fully employ'd, and their La∣bour
and Industry pertinently and usefully ap∣ply'd,
are as serviceable to the Interest of a
Community and Republic, and as contributary
to the making a Country Opulent and Weal∣thy,
as those are of any Rank and Quality what∣soever,
if not considerably more. And the
more any Nation is <HI>over-stock'd</HI> with <HI>Poor,</HI> it be∣comes
the more signally the <HI>Interest</HI> of that <HI>State</HI>

these being the only means of rendring such
<HI>steadable</HI> to the Common-wealth, who must

<HI>Scotland</HI> hath a large complement and share of

raising a breed of Seamen for Fleets of Men of
War, and for the Planting of <HI>Colonies</HI> abroad,
and the winning, extracting, and improving
the productions of those Lands and Countries,
whither they are carry'd, and where they are
set'led: So the <HI>Scots Peasantry</HI> are accustom'd
to a <HI>Frugal</HI> and <HI>Parsimonious</HI> way of <HI>Living;</HI> to
which those of some Neighbouring Nations, are
not, without great difficulty, to be brought,
nor hardly able to bear; which is a farther and a
considerable reason, why <HI>Scotland</HI> should pro∣ceed
and persevere in the settling and maintai∣ning
a Foreign <HI>Plantation.</HI> Nor are they only
dispos'd, as well as capable of living both health∣fully
and contentedly upon <HI>Viands</HI> and Allow∣ances,
that would reduce those of some other
<HI>Countries,</HI> who are as mean as they are, and born
as much upon the <HI>Flat,</HI> to a weak and languish∣ing,
if not to a starving Condition; but they are


<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
by the size and fabrick of their Bodies, the
Nimbleness and Agility of their Limbs, and
the Natural acuteness of their Understandings,
as capable of being Laborious, Industrious and In∣genious,
in whatsoever they are put upon, and
made apply and addict themselves unto, as
such of any other Country are.</P>
<P>Finally their great inclination to Marry, be∣cause
of their Narrow and Frugal way of Li∣ving,
and their prolificalness, and aptitude for
Generation, and thereupon, their accustomed∣ness
to Encrease and Multiply, thro' the par∣simonious
manner, of their Subsisting beyond
what is usual in most Countries, gives another
encouragement, as well as administers a further
Inducement; why the <HI>Scots</HI> should remain stea∣dy
and unchangable, in their Design and Un∣dertaking,
of establishing <HI>Foreign Colonies:</HI> See∣ing
they will upon that account, and by reason
thereof, become the <HI>Sooner Peopled,</HI> without
drawing too many <HI>Swarms</HI> from the <HI>Hive</HI> at
home. Of this their needs no other Proof,
than barely to observe, how the <HI>Scots</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI>
from a very inconsiderable <HI>Number,</HI> that settled
there not long ago, are Multiplied to a very great
and large body of People, whereof that King∣dom
receiveth and enjoyeth all the Benefits
both in Power and otherwise; and the whole
that falleth to the share of <HI>Scotland,</HI> is meerly
the Satisfaction and Credit, of having so vast
a Colony of their Countrymen there. And by
this blessing and advantage of being more Pro∣lifical
and Fertile, in the Procreating of Children,
than those of their strait and narrow circum∣stances,
are any where else; the Plantation of
<HI>Calidonia</HI> in the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien</HI> may in a few


<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
Years, become equal in Number of People, to
some other Colonies in that part of the World,
and <HI>Scotland</HI> may securely promise to it self,
the escaping of that Mischief, which hath be∣fallen
the Kingdom of <HI>Spain,</HI> in the being al∣most
Depopulated, by the <HI>Colonies</HI> which it hath
Planted in the <HI>West Indies.</HI> Yea, were there
not so much in what I have intimated, as I do
believe there is, for the rendring them suddenly
Populous, in any Plantation, which they shall
establish in an entire dependance upon them∣selves,
and especially Subservient and Condu∣cive
to their own Benefit; yet they will find
enough to <HI>Transport</HI> and <HI>Transplant</HI> Yearly, into
their <HI>Plantations</HI> without <HI>Draining</HI> their
<HI>Country</HI> of its Inhabitants, by meerly Inviting
and Prevailing upon such to go thither, whose
necessities do either compel them to Travel
abroad, in order to be Soldiers and Servants,
in Foreign Countries and Plantations, or who
stand reduced to pinching Wants, if not to be
Beggars at home; which being seconded and
accompanied with a thrifty, temperate and
regular Conduct in their <HI>Colony,</HI> and with the
giving due encouragement, thro' granting <HI>Li∣berty</HI>
of <HI>Conscience,</HI> as well as <HI>Secular Privileges</HI>
both in <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>there,</HI> to such strangers as
shall come and settle among them, thro' the
want whereof, <HI>Spain</HI> is become Dispeopled at
home, and their <HI>Plantations</HI> in <HI>America</HI> but
slenderly stockt with Inhabitants, they will not
only render the <HI>Calidonian Colony,</HI> suddenly po∣pulous
and Flourishing, but they will draw more
people into <HI>Scotland</HI> it self, than it now hath,
or can at any time hereafter, under all the ad∣vantages
of <HI>Commerce</HI> an <HI>Traffick,</HI> be well able


<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
to bear. Whereof <HI>England</HI> as well as <HI>Holland,</HI>
are evident examples and demonstrative Proofs,
being since their respective and several <HI>Plan∣tations,</HI>
in the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West Indies,</HI> mightily
encreased in the Number of their <HI>Inhabitants,</HI>
notwithstanding the vast <HI>Shoals</HI> of <HI>People,</HI> that
have from year to year been Transplanted into
those <HI>Colonies:</HI> For as the incomparable <HI>Author
of an Essay upon Ways and Means,</HI> doth assure
us <HI>that</HI> England <HI>since the year 1600, is increased
in Number of Inhabitants about 900000;</HI> Where∣of
I may venture to say the like of <HI>Holland</HI> in
proportion to the Dimension of their Ter∣ritories:
So it is undeniable, that within that
circle and compass of time, diverse of the
<HI>English</HI> Plantations, came to be erected and
established, and that all of them, as well as those
of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> have since that term of Years,
been enlarged, improved and become vastly
more Peopled than they were before.</P>
<P>So that it appeareth, from the whole which
hath been hitherto said, how much the <HI>Scots</HI>
have of late, discovered their Wisdom and
Prudence, and how highly their care and zeal
are to be <HI>Commended,</HI> in their having made an
Essay, and a Beginning for the encouragement
and enlargement of Manufacture at home, and
towards the erection and establishment of a Co∣lony
abroad, and by that Foundation which they
have laid, for the settlement and advancement
of <HI>Trade.</HI> And this unquestionably they have
a plenary right to do, as they are a <HI>Free</HI> and
<HI>Independant Nation,</HI> without asking the leave,
or demanding the concurrence of any Rulers
and Countries whatsoever, provided they
be Countenanced and Authorised thereun∣to,


<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
by their own King; and that they do no∣thing
therein, which is inconsistent with the
<HI>Laws</HI> of Nations, nor attempt the settling in
any <HI>Districts</HI> or <HI>Provinces,</HI> from which they
stand prohibited and excluded by publick and
solemn <HI>Stipulations,</HI> between him that now is
their Sovereign, or those that have been so for∣merly,
and other States, Princes, and Potentates.
For that <HI>Scotland</HI> dependeth upon, or is a <HI>Pro∣vince</HI>
Subordinate to any other Nation, and
<HI>Subjected</HI> to the Ordinances, Constitutions, and
Municipal Statutes thereof, I suppose none will
betray the Ignorance or have the Effrontery to
affirm. It being a Kingdom that holdeth of none
Save of God, for their <HI>Title</HI> unto and <HI>Pos∣session</HI>
of their <HI>Country,</HI> and of their own <HI>Swords,</HI>
under his providential Blessing and Aid, for
the Maintaining and Defending of them.</P>
<P>For tho' there be a very near and close Con∣junction
and Union, between the <HI>Kingdoms</HI> of
<HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> thro' their being under
one and the same <HI>King,</HI> rather than in the
virtue, and force of mutual Contracts and Alli∣ances▪
which I do heartily wish may always
continue, and that all the secret Caballings and
Clandestine endeavours of those, may prove a∣bortive,
unprosperous and miscarry, who ei∣ther
from Ancient Piques, personal Morose∣ness,
Envy, and ill Nature, or upon any other
Motives, Prospects and Designs whatsoever,
shall seek to weaken, interrupt, and especially
to dissolve it. Yet <HI>England</HI> doth not Challenge
and lay Claim to the having any <HI>Authority</HI>
over <HI>Scotland,</HI> nor pretend to an Imposing of
their own Laws upon that Nation, or to a
Supervising of such Parliamentary <HI>Bills</HI> as are


<PB N="31" REF="31"/>
prepared and formed there in order to the
being Enacted into Statutes. But the <HI>Scots</HI>
are absolute within themselves, and vested with
a Power underived from any Nation, and in
the exercise whereof they are accountable unto
none, for the making of Laws, and falling up∣on,
and pursuing all such Ways, Methods, and
Means, which are reconcilable with the Feal∣ty
and Loyalty, which they owe unto their
Prince, that may be subservient and usefull to
their own Safety and Interest. And in Testimo∣ny
and Evidence of their being a <HI>Free State,</HI> and a
Kingdom as entirely <HI>Independent</HI> upon <HI>England,</HI> as
upon any other Dominion whatsoever; they
both can, and do often lay what Customs
and Impositions they please, upon <HI>English</HI> Pro∣ductions
and Commodities, when carried and
Imported thither, to be vended and disposed
of there. And by a <HI>Power Inherent</HI> in themselves,
which <HI>England</HI> cannot reasonably dispute, nor
lawfully Controul: they sometimes do, and at
all times may, Inhibit and Forbid their own
People, the buying, using, and consuming such
Goods as were either Manufactured in <HI>England,</HI>
or brought thither by the <HI>English,</HI> from their Plan∣tations
and Colonies elsewhere.</P>
<P>And as in the Vertue of this independent
Freedom, Liberty, Previlege and Right under
the Authority and Power of their Kings, they
have at all times made legal Provision for
the <HI>Government</HI> of their People at home, and
pursued that little Trade, which they had
attained unto with such <HI>Nations</HI> abroad, as
were in Peace and Amity with their Princes,
without their being questioned for, or distur∣bed
in it by any, save by those that were


<PB N="32" REF="32"/>
in Hostility with their Sovereigns, and that
only in Seasons of actual War; so they have
by a fresh <HI>Exertion</HI> of this innate Freedom, and
inherent and independant <HI>Right,</HI> lately contri∣ved
and framed a <HI>Bill,</HI> which they have
obtained to be passed into an <HI>Act,</HI> and a <HI>Law,</HI>
wherein the People and Subjects of that
Kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> the Act for a Company Tra∣ding to <HI>Africa</HI> and the <HI>Indies, June</HI> 26. 1695.</NOTE> <HI>are empowered to erect Socie∣ties
and Companies, for the establishment
and carrying on Trade, with whatsoever
Nations and Countries, or Places in</HI> As<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪,
Africa,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Printed at</HI> Eden∣burgh <HI>by</HI> Andrew Anderson, <HI>and re∣printed at</HI> London, <HI>by</HI> John Whitlock.</NOTE> <HI>or</HI> America, <HI>which are either not
Inhabited, or where they have the consent of
the Natives, and Inhabitants thereof, un∣der
the Limitation and Restriction, that
such places are not</HI> Previously and Ante∣cedently
<HI>possessed by European Sovereigns, Potentates,
Princes and States.</HI> And moreover, <HI>that they
may provide and furnish the said Places, Cities
Towns and Forts, with Magazines, Ordinance,
Arms, Weapons, Ammunitions and stores of War,
and by force of Arms, defend their Trade, Navi∣gation,
Colonies, Cities, Towns, Forts, and Plantations,
and their other Effects.</HI> As likewise, <HI>that it
shall be Lawful for them to make Reprisals, and to
seek and take reparation of Damages done unto
them by Sea or Land, and to make and conclude
Treaties of Peace and Commerce with the Sovereign
Princes, Estates, Rulers, Governours, and Propri∣etors
of the said Lands, Islands, Countries or Places
in</HI> Africa <HI>or</HI> America.</P>
<P>In relation to which <HI>Act,</HI> for authorising
the <HI>Scots</HI> to establish a <HI>Foreign Trade,</HI> and
their being empowered to settle <HI>Plantations</HI> in
the forementioned <HI>Parts</HI> of the World, in or∣der
to the better gaining, enlarging, and pro∣tecting


<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
of it, the few things which I have to
offer under this head, shall be briefly these.
Namely, That as the <HI>Design</HI> of <HI>Erecting</HI> such a
<HI>Trade,</HI> and of <HI>Planting Colonies</HI> in the Subservien∣cy,
to the Maintaining, Improving and Exten∣ding
thereof, was not rashly and unthoughtfully
Undertaken by those of that Kingdom; so the
<HI>Act</HI> by which in pursuance of that Projection,
they stand warranted to do whatsoever is be∣fore
reported, was not surreptitiously obtained
of his Majesty, nor was he by any undue Artifi∣ces
misled into the Granting of it. For how
much foever that <HI>Nation,</HI> might be desirous to
have a <HI>Foreign Settlement,</HI> towards the better en∣abling
them for such a <HI>Traffick,</HI> and notwith∣standing
they sufficiently understood it to be
their great and indispensible Interest, to em∣bark
Vigorously both in <HI>Manufacture</HI> and <HI>Com∣merce,</HI>
yet their unsuccessfulness heretofore in
some attempts of that Nature, as particu∣larly
in the <HI>Plantation</HI> of <HI>Carolina,</HI> which they held
of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> antecedently to the
<HI>English</HI> planting there, from which they became
expelled by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> thro' want of that
protection, and of those encouragements which
were necessary to the having rendred them safe
and Prosperous; made them proceed slowly
and with great Calmness and Discretion, in the
Forming, Digesting and Maturating what they
have at last, after an adjusting of all that was
Prerequired thereunto, put in Execution. Nor
could the King be <HI>Surprized</HI> into the giving his
<HI>Royal Assent</HI> to the <HI>Bill</HI> for the premised esta∣blishment;
seeing▪ as they who served his Ma∣jesty
at that time, under the <HI>Characters</HI> of <HI>Com∣missioner</HI>
and <HI>Secretary</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> were persons as


<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
entirely in his Interest, and zealous for his Honour
and Glory, as ever any have been known to be
that filled those Posts; so there was an interpo∣sition
of two Years, whereby the King had all
the time, an opportunity desirable, for the
consideration of the most Important and Ardu∣ous
Affair, in which he might have informed
and Satisfy'd himself of the Justice and conve∣niency
of what was laid before him, and hum∣bly
desired of him, between the passing of the
32 <HI>Act</HI> of the Parliament, <HI>Anno</HI> 1693. which
invited and encouraged, persons in general to
enter into Societies and Companies, for car∣rying
on a Trade, in any or in all such parts of
the World, as were not in Hostility with his
Majesty, and the enacting of that Statute, which
was the 8 <HI>Act</HI> of the Parliament <HI>Anno</HI> 1695,
whereby that design was Perfected and Complea∣ted,
thro' a Companies becoming settled by
Law, vested with the Rights and Powers fore∣mentioned,
and favoured with such immunities,
as were necessary to encourage so hazardous and
expensive an Undertaking, as that was likely to
be, and will infallibly Prove.</P>
<P>And tho' the Grace and Goodness of his
Majesty, appear'd very eminently manifested to
the <HI>Scots</HI> therein, in vouchsafing to have gran∣ted
them the privileges, <HI>That none of their Stock
and Effects, shall be liable unto any manner of Con∣fiscations,
Seisures, Forfeitures, Attachments, Ar∣rests,
or Restraints; that they may Freight Outlan∣dish
and hired Ships, for the space of ten Years,
notwithstanding the Act for encouraging Shipping and
Navigation. Anno 1661. And that their Merchan∣dice,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See the Act.</NOTE>
<HI>goods and effects, shall be free from all manner
of Restraints and Prohibitions, and of all Customs,


<PB N="35" REF="33"/>
Taxes, Sesses, Supplies or other Duties imposed, or
to be imposed by Act of Parliament, or otherwise, for
and during the space of 21 years.</HI> As likewise,
<HI>That no Officer, Civil or Military, or other person
whatsoever within that Kingdom, shall Impress, En∣tertain,
Stop or Detain, any of the Members, Officers
or Servants, or others whatsoever, of or belonging to
the said Company; And that all these shall be Free,
both in their Persons, Estates and Goods, employed in
the said Stock and Trade, from all manner of Taxes,
Sesses, Supplies, Excises, quartering of Souldiers,
transient or local, or levying of Souldiers, or other Imposi∣tions
whatsoever for and during the space of 21 years.</HI>
Yet it must withal be acknowledged, that his
<HI>Majesty's</HI> Wisdom and Justice to all the World,
as well as to his Allies, and those that are his
own Subjects in his other Territories and
Dominions, are no less singularly, conspicu∣ously
and abundantly displayed, thro' the Provi∣ding
expressly and particularly in the said <HI>Act,</HI>
that no <HI>Prince, Country, People, or Colony, shall be In∣vaded
or Molested in what they are rightfully posses∣sed
of, nor disseised of their properties, or of what
they can lay Claim unto, by the Laws either of Na∣ture
or Nations.</HI> Which shews that what his
Majesty did, in passing the <HI>Act,</HI> that hath been
so often mentioned, was the result of great
Judgment, and mature Deliberation. And who∣soever
will but allow himself time to read
and consider it, will find himself oblig'd to
confess, that in no <HI>Projection</HI> whatsoever, to∣wards
a settlement of that Nature, nor in any
<HI>Statutes</HI> or <HI>Edicts</HI> enacted and emitted, for the
authorizing and countenancing of them, was
there ever such a regard had, and expressed to
the rights of Foreigners, or of Planters else∣where,


<PB N="36" REF="34"/>
and of the Natives where that Colony
should come to settle, as is done in the <HI>Scots Act</HI>
of Parliament.</P>
<P>Whereunto I will only further Subjoyn, that
the <HI>Scots</HI> have not only obtained an <HI>Act</HI> of
Parliament, <HI>Empowring</HI> them to plant and set∣tle
Foreign <HI>Colonies</HI> wheresoever they can,
without doing Injustice to the Natives, inva∣ding
the Territories, and Districts of other
Princes, or their being injurious to previous
and antecedent Planters; But they have likewise
procured a <HI>Patent</HI> under the great <HI>Seal</HI> of that
Kingdom, whereby all and every thing or
things, granted to them in the said <HI>Act,</HI> stand
ratified and confirmed by a Fact and Deed, that
is Personally his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s own, in the most distin∣guishing
manner, and that by which he <HI>Spea∣keth</HI>
most <HI>Vnretractably</HI> as well as <HI>Sovereignly</HI> to
his People. So that his <HI>Majesty</HI> being a <HI>Prince</HI>
eminent for his Veracity, and his Constancy to
his Royal Word, as well as for his Courage
Justice and Honour, He hath made it impra∣cticable,
without Sullying and Disparaging his
own Glorious Perfections, which 'tis Impossi∣ble
he should have the Weakness, Infirmity and
Imprudence to do, either to depart from, dis∣pense
with, or by a subsequent relaxing Inter∣pretation,
to Retract or Supersede what he
hath granted unto his <HI>Subjects</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> or
to avoid the Maintaining and Protecting them
in it. For tho' divers Projects, Proposals and
Matters, that are in themselves very Just
and Lawful, and which in their effects and
consequences would prove exceeding advanta∣geous
and usefull, may antecedently to their
<HI>Establishment</HI> by <HI>Laws,</HI> and by Royal <HI>Facts</HI> and


<PB N="37" REF="34"/>
<HI>Grants</HI> be declined and waved, as well as pro∣crastinated
and adjourned, upon the meer foot
and the single motive of their being <HI>Inconveni∣ent,</HI>
either thro' the <HI>Offence</HI> or <HI>Jealousie</HI> that may
thereby be administred to <HI>Allies</HI> and <HI>Princes</HI> in
<HI>Amity;</HI> Yet no publick and Solemn <HI>Laws</HI> are to
be violated or Royal <HI>Charters</HI> and <HI>Patents,</HI> to be
<HI>Over-ruled, Transgressed</HI> against and <HI>Vacated</HI> upon
the Inducement, and because some <HI>Potentates</HI>
with whom his <HI>Majesty</HI> is in Leagues, and un∣der
Stipulations and Compacts, may shew them∣selves
<HI>Peevish,</HI> and become Groundlessly▪ and
Causelessly <HI>Offended.</HI> For as all the Affairs that
fall under the <HI>Executive</HI> part of the <HI>Administra∣tion,</HI>
are <HI>Regulated</HI> either by <HI>Law</HI> or by Conve∣niency:
and come to be considered under the
Notion and Views, either of what may be done
with Profit to our selves, and without injustice
to any, tho' possibly not without giving Provo∣cation
unto divers, and the rendring them Dis∣contented;
or what according to the tenour
and <HI>Obligation</HI> of <HI>Laws,</HI> and the <HI>Sacredness</HI> of a
<HI>Princes Word</HI> declared and pledged in his <HI>Char∣ters</HI>
must and ought to be done; So whatsoever
latitude is left and allowed in reference to
matters and things of the first kind, for acting
according to the measures of civil Prudence,
and the rules of <HI>Politicks:</HI> Yet in relation to such
matters as are of the latter sort, there is no
room or place left to consult and deliberate
what is <HI>Fit</HI> to be done according to <HI>Topicks</HI> of
Convenience, Maxims of State, and politick
Theorems; but there ought to be a Conscien∣tious
observance and a Vigorous pursuance of,
as well as a firm and unchangeable adherence
unto what is made <HI>Legal,</HI> and which by con∣sequence,


<PB N="38" REF="35"/>
when and where the case is impor∣tant,
and the matter is of that concern and
value that the chiefest Interest of a Nation lies
in it, can neither be omitted nor dispensed
with, without obnoxiousness to guilt, as well as
to clamour and blame.</P>
<P>Nor may it in the next place be unworthy of
being represented, with what <HI>Readiness Vnani∣mity</HI>
and <HI>Zeal,</HI> the <HI>People</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> came into
this design, of <HI>Erecting Trade,</HI> and <HI>Establishing</HI>
a <HI>Foreign Plantation</HI> upon the passing the fore∣mentioned
<HI>Act.</HI> For the Subscriptions in order
to the raising and constituting a <HI>Fund,</HI> for the
setling a <HI>Colony,</HI> and thereby for the promo∣ting
of <HI>Traffick,</HI> for which they were allowed
by the <HI>Act</HI> of Parliament, from the 16 of <HI>June
1695,</HI> untill the First of <HI>August</HI> 1696, were
not only <HI>Filled, Compleated</HI> and <HI>Perfected,</HI> long
before the elapse of the time that was prefixed
by the <HI>Statute;</HI> But whereas it was provided,
that it should be held a sufficient Compliance,
with the design and Tenour of that <HI>Law,</HI> if
only half the Money that should be <HI>Subscri∣bed
towards the forming a Stock,</HI> did <HI>Belong</HI> unto,
and were the <HI>Proper Cash</HI> of such as were <HI>Scots,</HI>
and did live within that Kingdom; it deser∣veth
to be observed, that the whole, hath
been <HI>Subscribed,</HI> Advanced, and Paid in by such
as are <HI>Scots,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See the</HI> List <HI>of the</HI> Adventu∣rers, &amp;c. <HI>Printed at</HI> Edinb. 1696.</NOTE> which is not only beyond what
could have been expected, but may justly be∣get
Admiration; considering what in that <HI>In∣trim,</HI>
they have been obliged to pay in <HI>Taxes</HI>
for the Maintenance of <HI>Troops:</HI> and what they
have been necessitated to <HI>carry</HI> abroad in <HI>specie,</HI>
of their <HI>Cash</HI> for the purchasing <HI>grain,</HI> to live up∣on
in these late years of extraordinary <HI>Scarcity</HI>


<PB N="39" REF="35"/>
and <HI>Dearth;</HI> which, at the modestest Computa∣tion,
may be reckon'd to have exceeded <HI>Two
hundred thousand pounds Sterling.</HI></P>
<P>Nor are they meerly Persons of the <HI>Middle
Rank,</HI> or of the <HI>Mercantile</HI> Order, that have
contributed and put in their Money for the
framing of a <HI>Bank</HI> in order to the foremention'd
Ends; but they of all <HI>Qualities</HI> and <HI>Degrees</HI> have,
with great liberality and cheerfulness, answera∣ble
to their several <HI>Titles</HI> and <HI>Figures,</HI> contri∣buted
their shares to that <HI>Capital;</HI> and none
with greater Alacrity and in larger Proportions
than they of the <HI>Grand,</HI> as well as of the
<HI>Petite Nobless.</HI> For none of the greatest Persons
of that Kingdom have had the Folly and Pride
to excuse and cover themselves from becoming
Assistants to the founding and promoting of
<HI>Trade,</HI> by pretending it a disparagement to their
<HI>Garters</HI> and <HI>Coronets,</HI> and below the lofty Stiles
that they have by Parchments, which give them
an ascendency above Gentlemen. These days
of Vanity and Phantasticalness are over;
and they of the <HI>Sublimest Rank</HI> do begin to go∣vern
themselves by principles of Reason and
good Sense, and by Maxims of <HI>Civil, Social,</HI> and
Oeconomical Wisdom; and not by the airy,
whimsical and pernicious Notions of Haughtiness
and Luxury.</P>
<P>Yea, even they of the Military order, have such
of them, as were in a condition thro' having ac∣quir'd
beyond a naked subsistence during the War,
readily subscribed and paid in what they could,
and would have done it more plentifully, had they
receiv'd all their Arrears; and such of that Tribe
as were only <HI>Subordinate-Officers,</HI> or private <HI>Centi∣nels,</HI>
who are now reduc'd or disbanded, that could


<PB N="40" REF="36"/>
not bring in <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Silver</HI> to the encreasing of
the <HI>Fund</HI> and the augmenting of the <HI>Capital;</HI> yet
they have with great forwardness offer'd their
Bodies and their cold Iron to the Corporation
and Company, for the protecting of their Traf∣fick,
and the defending of their Plantation a∣gainst
all such as shall become their Enemies and
Assailants. And how dangerous soever Men of
that <HI>Praedicament</HI> may be to their Country, when
kept in too great Numbers regimented at home;
and how altogether useless they are unto it,
while they hear Arms under Foreign Princes
and States abroad; yet they are as capable as
any other whatsoever of being serviceable and
profitable thereunto, when employ'd in the Ways
and Methods to which many of them have be∣gun
to betake themselves. Of whom it will be
no presumption nor visionary Dream to add,
That as they do account their Wages, Salaries,
and Pay, to be their Estates; so they reckon
their Swords and Musquets to be their Title
unto it.</P>
<P>In brief, there are few Persons, Families, or
Orders of Men, that are of any Consideration
or Esteem, but who are become associated, uni∣ted,
and confederated, in this Project, Enter∣prise,
and Design. How much distant or diffe∣rent
soever Persons are, either in their <HI>Religions</HI>
or their <HI>Political</HI> Principles, yet herein they do
all of them amicably agree and combine: Nei∣ther
the <HI>Bigotry</HI> of the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> nor the re∣sentments
of those of the <HI>Diocesan</HI> Perswasion,
for the unkind and ill treatment they have met
with, do in this make any variance or discord
between them; but herein the Wolf and the
Lamb do tamely meet together, and the Leo∣pard


<PB N="41" REF="36"/>
and Kid do peaceably assemble as in one
Field. Nor do those great Animosities, or late
Hostilities, which have been between one ano∣ther,
about Rights and Claims to the Soveraign
Authority, and the Royal Jurisdiction, occasion
any misunderstanding or opposite Sentiments in
this, but both the <HI>Jacobites</HI> and the <HI>Williamites</HI>
do shew themselves equally and alike concern'd
in the promoting of a National Trade, and the
setling of a Foreign Colony. And, which is
of very material consideration, it deserves to
be observ'd, That besides what several Persons
have in their private Capacities Subscribed to∣wards
that Capital, not only most of all the
<HI>Corporations,</HI> but the Royal <HI>Burroughs</HI> of the
Kingdom, have become sharers therein, and
contributed liberally thereunto, out of their
Public Revenues.</P>
<P>From all which I may, with great safety, as
well as with decency and modesty, venture to
lay open and infer, how <HI>Mortifying, Afflictive</HI>
and <HI>Grievous</HI> it will be to that whole Nation,
to be <HI>discourag'd</HI> and <HI>frustrated</HI> of <HI>Protection</HI> from
the <HI>King,</HI> of whom pursuant to the <HI>Act</HI> and <HI>Pa∣tent</HI>
which he hath granted them, they expected
to be countenanc'd, animated and defended.
Nor dare they entertain such disrespectful and
undutiful thoughts of His <HI>Majesty,</HI> as the <HI>Pro∣clamations</HI>
emitted by His <HI>Governors</HI> over the <HI>Eng∣lish
West-India Plantations</HI> might seem to give oc∣casion
and umbrage for. Seeing as they have
not, by their setling at <HI>Darien,</HI> invaded the
<HI>Territories</HI> of any <HI>European Prince</HI> or <HI>State</HI> what∣soever,
nor have been injurious to the <HI>Natives,</HI>
in <HI>Planting</HI> there without their <HI>allowance</HI> and con∣sent,
nor in any one particular or circumstance,

have <HI>exceeded</HI> the <HI>Limits</HI> and <HI>Regulations</HI> pre∣scrib'd
unto them by the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> and
the <HI>King's Charter,</HI> as shall be fully and uncon∣troulably
demonstrated in what is to follow: So
they have a more engraven and firm belief of
His Majesty's Mercy and Justice, than to give
liberty unto themselves to think, that His Ma∣jesty's
Subjects in the <HI>West-India Plantations,</HI> de∣pending
upon, and subordinate to <HI>England,</HI>
should by an Order, Command, and Authority
from the <HI>King,</HI> be <HI>charged and required to hold
no Correspondence with the</HI> Scots, <HI>in their Colony at</HI>
Darien; <HI>nor to give them any assistance with Arms,
Ammunitions, Provisions or any thing else whatsoever.</HI>
For as much as this is not only inconsistent with,
and irreconcilable to his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s Goodness,
Wisdom and Righteousness; but directly repug∣nant
to the express Words, Terms and Clauses
of the forementioned <HI>Statute;</HI> by and wherein
his Majesty royally and solemnly promiseth, <HI>If
any of the Ships, Goods, Merchandize, Persons, or
other Effects whatsoever, belonging to the</HI> Scots <HI>Com∣pany,
trading to</HI> Africa <HI>and the</HI> Indies, <HI>shall be stopt,
detained, embezled, or taken away, or in any sort
prejudiced or damnified; that he will interpose his
Authority to have Restitution, Reparation, and Satis∣faction
made for the damage done, and that upon the
publick charge, which his Majesty shall cause, disburse
and lay out for that effect.</HI> So that thro' what
arts, and what means soever, these <HI>Proclamations</HI>
are come to be emitted and published: Yet the
<HI>Scots</HI> neither do, will, nor can entertain any o∣ther
thoughts of his <HI>Majesty,</HI> than that he will
carefully and powerfully cover and protect
them, instead of abandoning them to the rage
and power of such as may become their Ene∣mies,


<PB N="43" REF="38"/>
without the giving them aid, succour
and assistance. And in place of giving room
to any such sinistrous opinion, as if either his
Majesty could be indifferent, or meanly con∣cerned,
in countenancing of that <HI>Nation</HI> in an
<HI>Affair</HI> of so great an importance, and that is
so eminently subservient to the prosperity and
happiness of that Kingdom, or become alienated
and disinclined from upholding and defending
them in the possession of their Plantation of
<HI>Darien,</HI> they are tempted to give credit to a
passage in the <HI>Paris Gazette</HI> the first of <HI>August,
1699.</HI> Namely. <HI>On avoit avis, qu'on envoye des

assist the</HI> Scots <HI>at</HI> Darien, <HI>with all their Power, they
being no less his Subjects than they are.</HI></P>
<P>Nor can it be unmannerly or unlawful to add,
that it is of the last danger to a Prince, to ad∣minister
cause and occasion to a whole Kingdom,
to grow estranged in their affections unto him,
and to depart from their zeal for his service.
And it may with confidence be affirmed that
his <HI>Majesty</HI>'s treating the <HI>Scots</HI> in this manner,
either unkindly, or unsuitably to the hopes
wherewith they have fed themselves, is like
to have those effects and operations upon the
hearts and minds of most of that people. Tis
abundantly discovered in Histories how it hath
often proved unlucky and of ill consequence to
Sovereigns, to have disobliged and displeased
the generality of a Nation, tho' but in a trifle,
and that it hath been very fatal unto them, to


<PB N="44" REF="39"/>
discountenance and thwart their Subjects in
that wherein they placed their secular Glory,
and their temporal Happiness. Nor have the
Ties and Obligations upon the conscience of
<HI>Subjects,</HI> been at all times found sufficiently
powerful, to preserve them in discharge of Du∣ties
of exact Fealty and Loyalty; but these
bonds have been easily broken, and dissolved,
when ground hath been given, for the thinking
and believing, that their worldly Interest hath
not only been neglected, but opposed and sacri∣ficed.
And it is in vain for a <HI>Prince</HI> to rely
upon his Personal <HI>merits,</HI> or to trust to his own
<HI>Conscientiousness,</HI> of what he hath done in <HI>deli∣vering</HI>
a People from former distresses: Seeing
these will be found to afford him a very weak
and slender security, against the ungrateful and
ill natured resentments of a people, that shall
account themselves abandoned, or crossed in
what their present Genius, Humour and Biass,
do universally, sway, carry and determine them
unto.</P>
<P>Nor is it credible that his Majesty who is
a Prince of great Wisdom and Justice, would
have order'd those who Govern under him,
and by his Authority, in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> to emitt
and publish such Proclamations, without his
vouchsafing to have it told and represented to
the person Constituted by himself, for his <HI>Scots
Secretary,</HI> and who is Resident at his Court un∣der
that Character; seeing as that would have
imported such a Contempt, as well as a Neglect,
of his Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> that none without
rendring themselves Criminal, can conceive his
Majesty capable of being misled into it, so it is
sufficiently obvious to all thinking men, what


<PB N="45" REF="39"/>
the <HI>Scots Secretary</HI> hath made himself obnoxious
unto, if in case of his being made acquainted
with it, he did not discharge the duty incum∣bent
upon him by his <HI>Post,</HI> both towards his
Majesty in endeavouring to divert him from run∣ning
into such measures and in his informing
those of <HI>Scotland</HI> (to whom he will deservedly
find himself accountable,) with it, whose concern
it was to have it prevented. Yea it is so incon∣sistent
with all the rules of Prudence and Ju∣stice,
as well as of Honour, that nothing in
<HI>Don Quixot,</HI> or <HI>Amadis de Gaule</HI> can be more
Romantick, than that his Majesty should some
Months after the Orders must have been trans∣mitted
to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> for enjoyning and
and authorizing the forementioned Proclamati∣ons,
have Commanded the <HI>Lord President</HI> of
the <HI>Sessions,</HI> and my <HI>Lord Advocate</HI> to come from
<HI>Scotland</HI> and attend him at his Palace here, in
order to satisfy him of the Legality of the
<HI>Scots</HI> proceedure, had he been conscious in him∣self,
of having Empowred the English Secretary
Mr. <HI>Vernon,</HI> to convey such Instructions to the
governing Magistrates in the English Plantati∣ons,
as the Papers emitted there under the Ti∣tle
of <HI>Proclamations,</HI> would perswade us they are
warranted by and bottomed upon.</P>
<P>Nor in the case which I have now under
consideration, will the <HI>Scots</HI> reckon that their
<HI>Loyalty</HI> to his <HI>Majesty,</HI> and their <HI>Zeal</HI> for his
Interest and Service, were either esteemed or re∣warded,
as they flatter'd themselves they should
have been: For their having not only furnished
him, with so many and such brave Troops,
during the War, and for their preserving (now
meerly to please and gratify him) such a Num∣ber


<PB N="46" REF="40"/>
on Foot and in Pay, and that notwith∣standing
both the Poverty of the Country, and
the great Scarcity that for divers years it hath
groaned under, when their Neighbours have
not in proportion to their extent of Territories,
and of their Opulency, thought fit to continue
near the <HI>Quota</HI> of Forces, which they have done;
but especially because of their having, so readi∣ly
at first <HI>Declared</HI> him <HI>their King,</HI> when the bare
delaying, and the demurring only unto it for
a little time, would have gained them such <HI>Conces∣sions</HI>
from the <HI>People</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> that would have
made their looking after a <HI>Plantation</HI> of their
own Needless, or at the least have brought them
into that <HI>Conjunction,</HI> with the <HI>English Nation,</HI>
as would have engaged the whole strength
of that Powerful, and Wealthy Kingdom, for
their defence and support in the Colony, which
they have begun to settle.</P>
<P>Nor can it be undecent or immodest to
add, that the Protecting them in this under∣taking,
is the rather expected from his <HI>Ma∣jesty,</HI>
least otherwise they should have occasion
to complain of the Prejudice, they have recei∣ved
by the <HI>Revolution,</HI> with respect to their
<HI>Trade,</HI> instead of reaping the advantages which
they had thereby promised themselves, in that as
well as in other things. It being known to
diverse, that a proposal and <HI>Plan</HI> having by
some <HI>Scots</HI> men been laid before King <HI>James,</HI>
for the obtaining his Authority, as well as his
countenance, for their setling a <HI>Commerce</HI> in
<HI>Africa</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> how kindly he not only
received it, but with what both goodness and
readiness, he referred the consideration of it
to my Lord <HI>Middleton,</HI> my Lord <HI>Melford,</HI>


<PB N="47" REF="40"/>
Mr. <HI>Penn</HI> and Mr. <HI>Berkley,</HI> that upon their
opinion of the Justice and Equity of it, (who
were all known to be entire favourers thereof)
He might by his Royal Charter and Patent,
have empowered the <HI>Scots,</HI> to have proceeded
in the Establishing of it; and which nothing
could have obstructed, had not the Accession
of his Majesty, who was then Prince of Orange,
in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>England</HI> at that time intervened.</P>
<P>But to proceed unto that which doth in the
course of Method, next offer it self to be laid
open and Discoursed of, namely the <HI>Situation,
Nature</HI> and <HI>Conveniency</HI> of the <HI>Place,</HI> where the
<HI>Scots</HI> have pitched their <HI>Tents,</HI> and are about
establishing there <HI>Plantations,</HI> which is called
the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> and is a Country very
fit and proper for that purpose, as well because
of the <HI>Richness</HI> of the Soil, as by reason of its <HI>Situa∣tion</HI>
for <HI>Trade.</HI> It is the Narrowest part of <HI>America,</HI>
and lieth between the <HI>Northern</HI> and <HI>Southern,</HI> or the
<HI>Atlantick</HI> and <HI>Pacifick Oceans,</HI> and is Justly called
an <HI>Isthmus,</HI> as comprehending where it is broa∣dest
not above <HI>two degrees, (viz.)</HI> between eight
and ten N. L. and where it is narrowest about
but <HI>one degree.</HI> And it is in all probability
stiled the <HI>Ishhmus</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> from the great
<HI>River</HI> of that name, where with the <HI>Northern</HI>
coast is bounded to the <HI>East.</HI> For beyond that
<HI>River</HI> on the <HI>North side,</HI> the land doth so spread
to the <HI>East</HI> and the <HI>North-East,</HI> and on the
<HI>South side,</HI> to the <HI>South</HI> and <HI>South-East,</HI> that it
can no farther be called an <HI>Isthmus:</HI> But as to
the narrowest part of this <HI>American Isthmus,</HI>
which as I have said, doth not extend above
<HI>one degree,</HI> upon which the <HI>Scots</HI> have <HI>Setled</HI>
their <HI>Colony,</HI> and have appointed that the Coun∣try


<PB N="48" REF="41"/>
shall hereafter be called <HI>Calidonia,</HI> and that
<HI>themselves, Successors</HI> and <HI>Associates,</HI> shall be stiled
by the <HI>Title</HI> of <HI>Calidonians:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Wa∣fer</HI>'s new Voyage and description of the Isth∣mus of <HI>A∣merica. p.</HI> 46.</NOTE> <HI>Wafer</HI> doth assign
for its <HI>Western limits,</HI> from the Mouth of the
River <HI>Chagre,</HI> where it falls into the <HI>North Sea,</HI>
to the nearest part of the <HI>South Sea Westward</HI>
of <HI>Panama;</HI> and for its <HI>Eastern boundaries,</HI> from
point <HI>Garachma,</HI> or the <HI>South</HI> part of the <HI>Gulph</HI>
of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> directly <HI>Eastward,</HI> to the fore∣mentioned
<HI>River Darien:</HI> And all do know,
that it is circumscribed, limited and bounded,
on the <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South,</HI> by the two vast <HI>Oceans</HI>
that are so <HI>Denominated.</HI> And as to the par∣ticular
place, where the <HI>Scots</HI> have pitched their
<HI>Tents</HI> and <HI>raised Fortifications,</HI> it is upon a <HI>Har∣bour,</HI>
called by the <HI>Spaniards Acla,</HI> and by the
<HI>Natives Schocana,</HI> and is one of the most <HI>De∣fensible
Ports</HI> of the World, and is Situated a∣bout
two Leagues from the <HI>Golden Island,</HI> called
by the <HI>Spaniards Guarda,</HI> which as it is not fur∣ther
<HI>Distanced</HI> from the <HI>South Sea,</HI> than what
any man may <HI>Travel</HI> in <HI>two</HI> or <HI>three Days,</HI> and
which the <HI>Natives</HI> can do in <HI>one:</HI> So it lieth
in a <HI>Nearness</HI> of <HI>Eight</HI> or <HI>Nine Leagues,</HI> both
to the <HI>River Darien</HI> and <HI>Conception,</HI> upon which
<HI>Boats</HI> may go to the <HI>Southern Ocean.</HI> And as the
weather in the place, and on all hands where
the <HI>Scots</HI> are setled is exceeding temperate,
being much the same that is in other places
of the <HI>Torrid Zone</HI> of that <HI>Latitude,</HI> but inclin∣ing
rather, as <HI>Wafer</HI> says, to the wet extreme,
the <HI>Rains beginning</HI> usually in <HI>April</HI> or <HI>May,</HI> and
continuing more or less to the latter end of
<HI>August,</HI> but with intermixtures even then of
<HI>fair</HI> and <HI>dry days</HI> for a week together; So that
the <HI>Country,</HI> is healthful beyond what was com∣monly


<PB N="49" REF="41"/>
believed, or could have been imagined
unless experienced. And tho' the <HI>Artificial</HI>
productions of the District and Territory be
<HI>few</HI> by reason of the sloth and unskilfulness of
the <HI>Natives</HI> to cultivate the Land, and to im∣prove
and fabrick what it yields, yet the ground
is unconceivably <HI>fertile</HI> and <HI>rich,</HI> and might by
being well <HI>Manured</HI> and <HI>Agriculted,</HI> afford both
as great Variety and as great Plenty, for the
comfort and pleasure, as well as for the Ne∣cessities
of Life, as any Land in whatsoever
part of the World doth. However the <HI>Natu∣ral
Productions,</HI> and what it spontaneously yields,
as materials of, and commodities for Trade,
and to enrich such as are, or shall become en∣gaged
and Interessed in the Traffick, are divers
and great, both in the variety of kinds, and
in the Plenty and Quality of them. For be∣sides
its being stored with all sorts of <HI>Wood,</HI>
proper for <HI>Building</HI> and <HI>Wainscotting,</HI> and par∣ticularly
with Cedar, it hath also abundance
of <HI>white wood,</HI> fit for Cabinets, and <HI>Interlaying,</HI>
and which is more than all the other, it is
likewise plentifully furnished with <HI>Logwood,</HI>
which the <HI>English</HI> do now cut upon the <HI>Bay</HI> of
<HI>Hunderos,</HI> not without being exposed to great
hazard and danger; and (if credit may be given
to reports,) it is provided of <HI>Nicaragua wood,</HI>
which is a Commodity for <HI>Dying</HI> of that value,
as to be reckoned to approach to the worth
of <HI>Cochenele;</HI> and which is beyond all other pro∣ductions
whatsoever, It affordeth both <HI>Silver</HI>
and <HI>Gold Mines,</HI> as well as large quantities of
<HI>Gold Dust,</HI> that is <HI>gathered</HI> out of the <HI>Rivers,</HI>
after that it hath been <HI>washed</HI> from the <HI>Moun∣tains</HI>
by violent Rains. And then for the <HI>Peo∣ple,</HI>


<PB N="50" REF="42"/>
they are open, frank and good natured,
and for many Leagues round in an entire
Friendship with the <HI>Scots,</HI> having not only re∣ceived
them in a most obliging manner, at their
first arrival into those <HI>American parts,</HI> and their
<HI>Captains, Supreame Leaders,</HI> or <HI>Caiques,</HI> who have
neither dependance upon any other Prince or
State, nor upon one another, save by Leagues
for mutual defence, readily and with great
chearfulness, consented and agreed to permit
the <HI>Scots</HI> to settle among them, and to become
Inhabitants in their Country; but have by
stipulations and contracts since, Joyned in a Con∣federacy
with them, for the defence of them and
their Colony, against all such as shall in time to
come be their Enemies.</P>
<P>So that for <HI>Situation, as the Councel constitu∣ted
by the</HI> Indian <HI>and</HI> African <HI>Company of</HI> Scot∣land,
<HI>for the Government and direction of their Colo∣nies
and settlements in the</HI> Indies, <HI>have published in
their Declaration bearing date, at new</HI> Edinburg <HI>in</HI>
Calidonia December 28. 1698; it is a more con∣venient
<HI>Place</HI> than any other in all <HI>America,
to be the Store-house of the unsearchable Treasures
of the spacious South Seas, the door of Commerce to</HI>
China <HI>and</HI> Japan, <HI>and the Emporium and Sta∣ple
for the Trade of both the</HI> Indies. And as it is
there that the <HI>Scots</HI> have settled a <HI>Colony</HI> and
<HI>Plantation,</HI> by and with the consent of the Na∣tives;
no <HI>European Prince</HI> or State being there∣of
possessed, or having right of claim there∣unto;
so they did not offer to enter upon
that <HI>District</HI> and <HI>Territory,</HI> without the having
a particular and strict regard unto, and con∣forming
exactly with all the <HI>Regulations, Pro∣viso's,</HI>
and <HI>Limitations</HI> laid down and prescribed


<PB N="51" REF="42"/>
in the <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Parliament,</HI> and in his Majesty's
<HI>Patent,</HI> and the having seriously Considered and
duly Weighed, whatsoever could be pretended
or alledged against them, upon their proceed∣ing
to establish a <HI>Colony</HI> there. For the exa∣mination
whereof, they allowed themselves suf∣ficient
time, in that tho' their Subscriptions
were perfected and compleated, about the be∣ginning
of the year 1696; yet they did not
send their Ships from <HI>Scotland,</HI> untill the
Month of <HI>July</HI> 1698, which arrived not in that
place until <HI>November</HI> following.</P>
<P>And as it is not only hoped, but morally
certain, that great advantages of attaining un∣to
Wealth, Power and Honour, will thereby
accrue and be administred to <HI>Scotland;</HI> so it
might easily be Demonstrated, that very consi∣derable
<HI>Benefits,</HI> will infallibly Redound from
thence unto <HI>England,</HI> and that both in times of
Peace and of War. Seeing as it will be a means,
whereby in a short time, a compendious <HI>Way</HI>
and <HI>Passage</HI> for <HI>Trade</HI> to <HI>China, Japan,</HI> as well
as to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> may be obtained and
rendred secure, whereby the <HI>English,</HI> will be∣come
qualified and enabled, not only to outdo
the <HI>French,</HI> who begin to Rival them in Traf∣fick
to the latter, but to equal the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who
do at present far exceed them in it: So by
the conveniency of the <HI>Scots Caledonian Planta∣tion,</HI>
both a great quantity more of the <HI>Manu∣factures</HI>
of that <HI>Kingdom,</HI> will come to be ven∣ted
in all the <HI>East parts</HI> of the World, as well
as in the <HI>Spanish West-Indian</HI> Provinces, and
the expence made less, and the returns much
Speedier and Surer, to and from the latter,
than they are, or ever can be, by the way of


<PB N="52" REF="43"/>
<HI>Cadiz</HI> and <HI>Malaga.</HI> And as for the <HI>English
Plantations</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> they will not only have
larger and more advantageous occasions, of
Trading into the <HI>Spanish American Colonies;</HI> but
the very <HI>Scots</HI> of the <HI>Calidonian</HI> Plantation, will
will take off and consume abundance of their
Commodities and Productions, especially theirs
of <HI>New York</HI> and <HI>New England,</HI> for which they
will pay in <HI>Gold</HI> and in <HI>Silver,</HI> and such valuable
Goods, as the <HI>Mines, Rivers,</HI> and <HI>Land of Darien</HI>
do yield and furnish. And should a War at
any time come to be between the <HI>Kings</HI> of
<HI>Great Britain</HI> and of <HI>Spain,</HI> as who knoweth
what may hereafter fall out, <HI>Calidonia</HI> is and
will in that case be found, the best Situate
place of any in the World, from whence and
by means whereof, to do Hurt and Prejudice
to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and to yield service to his
<HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty, and give his Subjects oppor∣tunities
of enriching themselves. Seeing the
<HI>Scots Colony</HI> there, will prove to be not only
<HI>Posted,</HI> in the middle and bosom of the <HI>Spa∣nish
American Ports</HI> for <HI>Traffick,</HI> having <HI>Carthage∣na</HI>
on the <HI>East, Porto Bèllo</HI> on the <HI>West,</HI> and <HI>Pana∣ma</HI>
on the <HI>South;</HI> but will be found to stand <HI>Si∣tuated</HI>
in the direct way and passage, that their
<HI>Flotas, Galleons, Armados</HI> and <HI>Armadilals</HI> must
go and return to and from <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru.</HI>
Nor on the supposition of such a Hostility a∣rising
between these two Crowns, as I have
mentioned, will the <HI>English</HI> meerly have a larger,
better and more Fortified <HI>Harbour</HI> for Ships,
either of War or Commerce, than any of their
own <HI>West India Plantations</HI> do afford; But they
will have one to Receive, Cover and Protect
them, that is nearer and more adjacent by a


<PB N="53" REF="43"/>
hundred Leagues to <HI>Porto Bello</HI> and <HI>Panama,</HI> than
<HI>Jamaica;</HI> and by above <HI>three hundred</HI> than <HI>Bar∣badoes,</HI>
which of all the <HI>English American Colo∣nies,</HI>
are the least distanced from them. But
seeing I shall have occasion to discourse more
fully hereafter, of the benefits and advantages,
which will accrue to the Crown and Kingdom
of <HI>England,</HI> by the <HI>Scots</HI> having settled in <HI>Da∣rien,</HI>
and how much upon that account, it is
both the Interest of the <HI>King,</HI> and of the <HI>English</HI>
Nation, that they should be maintained and
defended in the possession of their Plantation
at <HI>Calidonia;</HI> I shall therefore insist no more
upon it under this <HI>Head,</HI> but adjourn what
is to be further represented, and argued
to the foregoing purpose, until it will lie
more naturally before me in some other Para∣graph.</P>
<P>That which I am then in the next place to
advance unto, is to Justifie and Prove beyond
all possibility of any reasonable Reply, that the
<HI>Scots,</HI> by their establishing a <HI>Colony</HI> on the
<HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> have made no <HI>Invasion,</HI> upon
the <HI>Rights</HI> or <HI>Dominions,</HI> and <HI>Territories</HI> of the
<HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> nor have therein <HI>Acted</HI> contrary ei∣ther
to the Laws of <HI>Nations,</HI> or to any <HI>Articles</HI> of
<HI>publick Treaties,</HI> that have intervened, or have
been Conserted, Accorded and Stipulated, be∣tween
the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and those of
<HI>Spain?</HI> 'Tis true his <HI>Spanish Majesty,</HI> hath by
several <HI>Memorials</HI> delivered by his Ministers to
his <HI>Britannick Majesty,</HI> or to his <HI>Secretaries</HI> of
State, represented, remonstrated and com∣plained,
as if the <HI>Scots,</HI> had thereby made an
<HI>Infraction</HI> of the <HI>Peace,</HI> between the <HI>Crowns,</HI> were
become guilty of an Insult▪ and Attempt against


<PB N="54" REF="44"/>
his <HI>Catholick</HI> Majesty, and that by settling a Plan∣tation
in that place, they have posted them∣selves,
<HI>dansles Souverains, &amp; le plus Interieur de
ces Demaines de sa Majeste, In the Soveraign and
most Inward Territories of and belonging to his Spa∣nish
Majesty.</HI> And as in case that the matter
stood as it is represented, and as the complaint
doth import, the blame thereof, ought to
be wholly and entirely imputed unto the
charged upon the <HI>Governours</HI> and <HI>Directors</HI> of
the <HI>Company</HI> erected for <HI>Trading</HI> to <HI>Africa</HI> and
the <HI>Indies,</HI> and no ways either in the Injury
that is done, or in the clamours and accusati∣ons
which arise by and from it, to affect his
<HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty in his Justice, Veracity and
Honour; so it would be both requisite and ne∣cessary,
on the foot of Righteousness, as well as
of Truth, that full reparation should be made
to his <HI>Catholick</HI> Majesty, if the <HI>Fact</HI> of the <HI>Scots,</HI>
in planting on the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> were dis∣agreable
to Royal and National <HI>Treaties,</HI> and a
forceable seisure, in times of Amity and Peace
of the <HI>Lands</HI> and <HI>Demains</HI> of that <HI>King.</HI> Yet I
hope, it will not be accounted Rudeness or In∣solence,
in me to say, that it is both expected
and demanded, that none will discover and be∣tray
themselves, to be persons of so little Pru∣dence
or Equity, as upon the single credit, and
alone evidence of <HI>Memorials</HI> to submit unto, and
to suffer, their being either surprised, or
wheedled, or menaced and hecto<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed into a
belief, that the settling the aforesaid Colony,
in the <HI>place</HI> abov<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mentioned, is therefore In∣jurious
and Criminal in the <HI>Scots,</HI> and to be rec∣koned
an Invasion upon the Sovereign Rights,
and the Lawful Dominions of the <HI>King</HI> of


<PB N="55" REF="44"/>
<HI>Spain,</HI> meerly because it is alledged and
affirmed by his Ministers and in his name to
be so.</P>
<P>And I do reckon my self fully warranted, in
the requiring and exacting this of every man,
who desires to escape the censure and reproach
of being Imprudent, Partial, and Iniquous; in
that it hath very often, and upon frequent occa∣sions,
been the custom and practice of States, Prin∣ces
and Potentates, to remonstrate and complain
of the proceedings of other Rulers, Governours
and Soveraigns, and of their several and respective
Subjects; when all that hath been offered, at∣tempted
and done by those who have been thus
applyed and addressed unto, and complained of,
hath been Lawful, Friendly, Honourable and
Just, and only accounted inconvenient at the
Season, or held to administer ground of Jea∣lousie
and Fear, that it might in the future,
be prejudicial unto such who were the Com∣plainants
and Remonstrants. And as no Po∣tentate
or Court in the World, hath oftener
and more clamorously, betook themselves unto
this Method, than they of <HI>Spain</HI> have done, in
reference unto, and behalf of what they un∣reasonably
challenge, and would have others be
so weak, as to allow them a Right unto the
<HI>West-Indies;</HI> so they have commonly, in the
issue and event been made to understand, that
they had no Pleadable, Valuable and Justifia∣ble
reasons, grounds or causes, for their Re∣monstrances
and Complaints. Whereof as the
Histories of all Nations, are full of Examples,
and Instances, so our own are not barren and
unprovided of them. Unto which as I shall
confine my self, on the motive of the Brevity,


<PB N="56" REF="45"/>
that this discourse is designed to be of; so I
shall only assign a few out of the many that
might be enumerated. Whereof, the first shall
be, the Behaviour and Answer of <HI>Queen Eliza∣beth,</HI>
during the time of Amity with <HI>Spain,</HI>
and before there was any rupture, between her
and <HI>Philip</HI> the <HI>Second,</HI> upon a complaint against
one <HI>Captain Parker,</HI> made unto her by the
<HI>Spanish Minister,</HI> who resided at her Court, un∣der
a publick Character; which I do the rather
mention, because it relates to something that
fell out at <HI>Darien,</HI> where the <HI>Scots</HI> having ta∣ken
the freedom to settle, and to establish a
Plantation, is made the ground of the <HI>Memo∣rials</HI>
presented lately to his <HI>Majesty</HI> by the
<HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassador, in the name of the <HI>Catholick
King:</HI> For Captain <HI>Parker</HI> having in the year
1565, Sailed from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Darien,</HI> and be∣gun
to manage a profitable <HI>Trade</HI> with the
Natives, the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who have been always
Jealous of, and offended at any other Europe∣ans
coming into, and Trafficking in those parts
of <HI>America,</HI> came with Armed Ships against
him, and after having threatned, to make prize
of him, and those that were with him, unless
he would immediately depart, upon his refusal
to do so, they attempted it. But <HI>Parker</HI> being
a gallant man, and being likewise assisted by the
Natives, he not only beat the <HI>Spaniards</HI> that

Whereunto may be added, that famous and
remarkable transaction, much about the same
Season, between <HI>Queen Elizabeth</HI> and <HI>Philip</HI> the
<HI>Second,</HI> in relation to Captain <HI>Drake,</HI> who having
in a time of Peace, betwixt the two Crowns,
been seised by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> for <HI>Trading</HI> in the
<HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and who thereupon, having
been allowed by her <HI>Majesty,</HI> to make himself
reparation and satisfaction, for the Wrong and
Dishonour done to her, as well as for the Loss
and Injury, which he had Sustained, sailed to
<HI>Boco Fero,</HI> where being shewed the <HI>South Sea,</HI>
and also assisted by the Native <HI>Indians,</HI> who
had War with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> he took and plun∣dred
some rich <HI>Spanish</HI> Vessels, at St. <HI>Lazarus

who was then <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassador at the Court

great Act of Depredation, committed by <HI>Drake</HI>
upon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the West Indies, and
thereupon demanded reparation of the Loss
and Damage, which his Masters Subjects had
thereby undergone, he was answered by the
<HI>Queen</HI> almost in the very terms, and directly
to the purpose following.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Cam∣den'<HI>s</HI> Eli∣zabeth <HI>lib. 2. p.</HI> 255. An. Dom. 1565.</NOTE> Namely, <HI>That as the</HI>
Spaniards <HI>had drawn these Inconveniencies and
Mischiefs upon themselves, by their severe and un∣just
dealing with the</HI> English <HI>in their</HI> American
<HI>Commerce, and their Trade there with the Natives,
so she did not understand, why either her Subjects,
or those of any other</HI> European <HI>Princes, should be
debarred from Traffick in the Indies. Vnto which
as she did not acknowledge the</HI> Spaniards <HI>to have
any title by the donation of the Bishop of</HI> Rome; <HI>so she
knew no right they had to any places there, besides those</HI>


<PB N="58" REF="46"/>
that they were in actual possession of; Seeing their
having touched only here and there upon those coasts,
given names to Rivers, or Capes, and possibly built
a few Cottages, were such insignificant things, as
could no ways entitle them to a Propriety, further
than they were actually settled, and continued to
inhabit. And therefore, that as all their claim
unto other Parts, Places and Countries in the <HI>West
Indies,</HI> was only Imaginary and Chimerical; so it
was thereupon Free, for other Princes and States,
and their respective Subjects, without the least Breach,
or Violation of the Laws of Nations, both to Trade
and Transplant Colonies, into all such <HI>American</HI>
Districts and Territories, where the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did
not inhabit. And that as all pretence to a right
to any Country there, otherwise than as they were
possessed of it, is nothing but a vain and unjust
Vsurpation, which makes no foundation, nor gives
any right by and according to the laws of Nations,
for a limited and restrained claim, in and over
those Countries; so it is as lawful for any other
Nation, as it is for <HI>Spain,</HI> to Navigate that vast
Ocean, without being inhibited, obstructed, or there∣in
Disturbed; in that the use of the Sea and Air
is common unto all and every people whatsoever, nei∣ther
Nature nor custom having given or allowed,
possession or Propriety thereof, to any one particular
Country of the World, Preclusive of others.</P>
<P>But tho' this that I have here reported may
very reasonably be counted enough to have been
said under this <HI>head,</HI> as being so full, as well as
pertinent, for shewing how little reason and
cause there may often be, of Judging hastily,
conclusively and prejudically of the proceed∣ings
and Facts of the Subjects of any State, or

in <HI>Memorials</HI> by the <HI>Ambassadours</HI> of other
<HI>Princes,</HI> stiling and representing what hath
been done by them, under the Characters of
being violatious of the Laws of Nations, Inva∣sions
upon the Territories and Jurisdictions of
Potentates, and Infractions of publick Treaties
and Alliances; yet I shall not reckon it either
superfluous or impertinent, nor will the reader I
hope think it tedious, to have one Instance more
subjoyned, that was of a parallel nature, and to
the same purpose and upon the same occasion:
which as it referreth to a <HI>Memorial</HI> of the same
importance and kind, with those that have
been presented lately to his <HI>Majesty;</HI> so it was
one delivered into a <HI>King</HI> of <HI>great Britain</HI> by an
<HI>Ambassadour</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> in the name and in obedi∣ence
to the Command of his <HI>Master.</HI> Whereof
the Story in brief is this: Namely that in the
year 1629. being after a Rupture, and during
the time of a War, between the Crown of
<HI>Great Britain,</HI> and of <HI>Spain,</HI> divers of the Eng∣lish
Nation, finding the <HI>Islands</HI> of <HI>Cateline</HI> and
<HI>Tortuga</HI> unpossessed and empty of Inhabitants,
did thereupon seize and begin to plant Colonies,
on them, giving to the former the name of the
<HI>Island</HI> of <HI>Providence,</HI> and to the latter the name
of the <HI>Island</HI> of <HI>Association.</HI> And which they
continuing to inhabit, and occupy after the
establishment, of the Peace betwixt his <HI>Britan∣nick
Majesty,</HI> and the <HI>Catholick King, Anno</HI> 1630.
the Spaniards became thereat offended, not on∣ly
because of its being an extending, and an
enlargement of English Settlements in <HI>America,</HI>
but by reason of the nearness of those <HI>Islands</HI> to
the <HI>Spanish West-India Colonies,</HI> particularly to
those of <HI>Cuba</HI> and <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> and according∣ly


<PB N="60" REF="47"/>
complained thereof to King <HI>Charles</HI> the First,
by their Ambassador; who tho' he was a Prince
both of those Morals and Politicks, that he
would not countenance, the least thing that was
unjust, and Illegal towards and against any,
and much less in relation to Soveraigns and
Potentates, with whom he was in Leagues, and
Alliances, nevertheless he gave in Answer to
the said Complaint, that his <HI>Subjects</HI> having
found those <HI>Islands,</HI> both unpossessed by the Spa∣niards,
and uninhabited by any other people
whatsoever, had thereupon by the Laws of Na∣ture
as well as of Nations, a Liberty and Right
to sit down and to plant there. And that they
ought not to be therein Obstructed or hindred,
either because of Jealousies, which the Spaniards
might entertain, on the foot of those Islands
being so adjacent to their Territories, or by
reason of any apprehensions they might have,
that <HI>English</HI> Colonies there, would prove after∣wards
inconvenient, and prejudicial unto them.
In which Answer the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were so far forced
to acquiesce at that time, as not to reckon that
Fact of his <HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty's Subjects to be
any Infraction of Alliances, or a Rupture of the
Peace. Tho' I must withall add, that upon the
arising of misunderstandings between King
<HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>First</HI> and his <HI>People</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and
upon his Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> running into Re∣bellion,
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made those advantages, of
our quarrelling here at home among
our selves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. Scriptum Cromweli, in qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ipubl. Angliae causa contra Hispa∣nos justa esse de∣monstratur: Edit. Lond. 1655.</NOTE> as to assault the English in
both the forementioned <HI>Islands,</HI> and were
therein so successful, as first to drive
them out of <HI>Tortuga, Anno</HI> 1634. and
afterwards out of <HI>Cateline Anno</HI> 1640.


<PB N="61" REF="47"/>
In the attempt whereof as they acted against all
the measures of Law and Justice, and to the
highest degrees of cruelty and barbarity in the
execution of it, so it is too well known upon
whom both the blame and Infamy are to be
charged, that those Invasions of the Spaniards
upon the Rights, Properties and Possessions of
the <HI>English,</HI> were not Revenged as they deser∣ved,
and as they undoubtedly would have been,
had not King <HI>Charles</HI> been diverted and hinder'd
from it, by the unhappy differences, which
sprung up between him and his People.</P>
<P>Having then done, what I hope will be
judged sufficient to obviate and prevent all
misconstructions and sinistrous thoughts, which
might otherwise have risen in the minds of
any, by reason of the late <HI>Memorial</HI> presented
to his <HI>Majesty,</HI> I do reckon, that I have there∣by
paved my way, towards an examination
of the <HI>Fact</HI> of the <HI>Scots Company,</HI> in their set∣ling
at <HI>Darien,</HI> whether it ought to be ac∣counted
illegal, and unjust, contrary to the
<HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> and of <HI>Nations,</HI> and to inter∣fer
with solemn Regal <HI>Stipulations?</HI> or whe∣ther
it may be esteemed Lawful, Righteous and
Agreeable to all the rules and measures of
Wisdom, Amity and Justice? as that I may
now apply and address my self directly and
closely to it, without finding the forementi∣oned
<HI>Remonstrances,</HI> to remain an Impediment
and obstruction in my way. And as an In∣troduction
thereunto, I cannot but both ac∣knowledge
and commend, the Fair, Honoura∣ble
and Friendly proceedure of the <HI>Catholick
King,</HI> in that he hath by <HI>Memorials,</HI> given in
to his <HI>Britannick Majesty,</HI> chosen to assert his


<PB N="62" REF="48"/>
pretensions and rights in an Amicable way,
and so affords an opportunity, that the whole
World may be satisfied, on the Foot and <HI>To∣picks</HI>
of Reason, Custom and Law, that neither
the <HI>Act</HI> and <HI>Patent,</HI> which the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Great
Britain,</HI> hath <HI>granted</HI> to his <HI>Subjects</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
are any ways either disagreeable to <HI>Treaties</HI>
with <HI>Spain,</HI> or dissonant from the received Max∣ims
of Equity and Justice, by which States
and Princes do govern themselves, in their
Publick and Political actions towards one and
other; Nor that the <HI>Scots Company,</HI> have either
exceeded the limits prescribed unto them, in
the <HI>Statute</HI> and <HI>Charter,</HI> by which they are au∣thorized
to Trade to <HI>Africa</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> and
to establish Colonies and Plantations there, or
that they have done any thing <HI>prejudicial</HI> unto
and <HI>Invasive</HI> upon the <HI>Rights</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI> For
hereby instead of putting the decision of this
great and important affair, upon the Strength
Power and Success of Arms, and the verdict
that should result from Hostility and War;
it is placed on the amicable foundation of Rea∣son,
Alliances and Laws, and made adjudge∣able
in the Cabinets, and at the Councel Boards
of Princes, and not immediately referred to
a determination, by Fleets and Armies on the
<HI>Ocean</HI> and Continent. And therefore that this
matter, may be set and represented in the
best and clearest light, for an amicable adjust∣ment,
and composure of it, between his <HI>Brit∣tanick
Majesty</HI> and the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> I shall in
order thereunto, propose and lay down, some
things in the way of so many <HI>Premises,</HI> which
which shall carry that intrinsick certainty and
evidence in them, as to resemble and be of


<PB N="63" REF="48"/>
the Nature of <HI>Postulata</HI> in <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> and
which shall be found as undeniable principles,
in a discourse that is relative unto, and con∣cerning
right of property in a Country, as the
other are acknowledged by all men to be in
Geometry.</P>
<P>Whereof the <HI>first</HI> is this, namely, that the
Original, most Ancient, and that which is by
all <HI>Civilians,</HI> confessed to be the ground and
foundation, of the uncontrovertible <HI>Title</HI> and
<HI>Right</HI> of any people, to this or that <HI>Country,</HI>
is their having been the <HI>Primitive Occupiers</HI>
and <HI>Possessors</HI> of it. <HI>Quod enim est Nullius, per
occupationem acquiritur ejus Dominium,</HI> say all
Civilians. For while the greatest, or any <HI>part</HI>
of the <HI>World,</HI> lay wholly <HI>Void</HI> and <HI>Vninhabited,</HI>
and for the Occupation whereof, no formal Divi∣sion
had intervened, and been agreed upon, by
those who emitted Colonies for the possessing and
planting such and such parts of the Earth, assig∣ning
to every one of those Colonies, there several
and respective partitions and districts; in that
case the right of <HI>Title</HI> unto, and of <HI>Property</HI>
in such a Country, and place became, <HI>primi
possidentis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Puffend.</HI> de Jur. Nat. &amp;. <HI>Gent. lib. 4. cap.</HI> 7. Grot de. Jur. Bel. &amp; Pac. lib. 2. cap. 2. §. 2. de Offic. 3.</NOTE> <HI>his or theirs who were the first occupiers
thereof.</HI> 'Tis taken for a dictate of Na∣ture,
and is that which the Universal reason
of Mankind conducted them unto, in the first
and separated division, which was made of this
habitable World, so far as it was void and un∣inhabited,
<HI>Vt quod quisque occupasset, id proprium
haberet, That whatsoever any came actually to pos∣sess
and occupy, thereof they should be acknowledged
to have the propriety.</HI> And as <HI>Cicero</HI> long before
our late <HI>Civilians</HI> expressed it, <HI>Quod cuique obti∣git,
id quisque teneat, Wheresoever any mans Lot


<PB N="64" REF="49"/>
falls to be the first possessor, that he hath a Legal claim
thereunto.</HI> Which possession or occupation▪ as they
are not accounted to stand acquired by any
meer act of the <HI>Mind,</HI> whether in way of wish
or purpose of settlement in such a place, but
they are only obtained in and by a <HI>Bodily Act,</HI>
that is <HI>quasi positio pedis a placing and fixing there
foot upon it;</HI> So no bare transient and vagrant
passage, thro' an empty and uninhabited Coun∣try
without setling their abode, and continu∣ing
to reside in it, was ever held sufficient by
any <HI>Civilian</HI> for the giving unto those <HI>Itinerant
passengers</HI> a claim of <HI>Property</HI> and <HI>Inheritance</HI> there.
For as <HI>Grotius</HI> says <HI>Desultoria possessio nihil efficit,</HI> An
occasional touching at a place without settling
and continuing to inhabit giveth no right
thereunto in Law. And as <HI>Puffendorf</HI> speaks to
the same purpose, <HI>Occupasse tum demum rem
aliquam dicimur quando possessionem ejus adprehen∣dimus:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">De jure Nat. &amp; Gent. lib. 4. cap. 6. §. 8.</NOTE>
<HI>ita ut occupatio rerum mobilium fiat mani∣bus,
soli pedibus; vidisse autem tantum, aut scire
ubi quid sit, nondum ad possessionem sufficere judi∣catur.</HI></P>
<P>Whereunto may be added in the second place,
That the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did not find those Countries,
Kingdoms, Isles and Provinces, whereof they
are either possessed, and confessed by all to be
so, or those unto which they pretend a right,
tho' it be not acknowledg'd by others, <HI>void</HI> and
<HI>empty</HI> of <HI>People,</HI> and <HI>uninhabited;</HI> but that when
they came thither and arriv'd there, they found
them actually possess'd by a large and numerous
<HI>People</HI> that had no knowledge of, nor dependance
upon <HI>Spain,</HI> nor had deriv'd either their own
<HI>Original,</HI> or their <HI>Title</HI> to occupy and inherit
those spacious and vast <HI>American Territories</HI> from


<PB N="65" REF="49"/>
the <HI>Spaniard;</HI> so that whatsoever <HI>Title</HI> or <HI>Pro∣perty</HI>
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are come to have unto, and
over those <HI>Dominions,</HI> it must be deriv'd either
from the <HI>Donation</HI> of the <HI>Pope,</HI> or acquir'd by a
Conquest of those, who were the previous and
ancient <HI>Proprietors;</HI> or it must be obtain'd by a
grant from the <HI>Natives,</HI> in the vertue whereof
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have a right transferr'd unto them,
and are with and by the consent of the <HI>Indians,</HI>
made the rightful and universal <HI>Proprietors</HI> of
all those Countries.</P>
<P>And as to their <HI>Claim</HI> by the <HI>Pope's Donation,</HI>
the very mentioning, and much more the plead∣ing
of it, is a ridiculing, as well as bantring of
Mankind; seeing even on the supposal, that the
<HI>Roman Pontiffs</HI> should be acknowledg'd the Suc∣cessors
of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> which as no Protestants
are forward to believe or confess, so they have
never hitherto found, nor do they think they
ever shall find the <HI>Pontificians</HI> able to prove it:
Yet this would invest them with no right of
disposing the Kingdoms of the World as they
please, and unto whom they will. For <HI>Peter</HI>
being cloathed with no such Power himself, nor
having ever pretended to exert such a <HI>Jurisdi∣ctive
Authority,</HI> as some <HI>Popes</HI> have had the Va∣nity
and Pride to do, how could he convey it
unto, and entail it upon others, under the qua∣lity
and character of being his Successors? Yea
our Lord <HI>JESVS Christ</HI> was so far from ex∣ercising
a <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> of divesting Prin∣ces
of their Soveraignties, Principalities and
Dominions, tho' all of them were then gross
<HI>Idolaters,</HI> that he would not be prevail'd upon
to <HI>divide</HI> an <HI>Inheritance</HI> between two Brethren,
when desir'd by one of them to do it. But as


<PB N="66" REF="50"/>
he made it the duty of all those who should
believe in him, and embrace the Christian Faith,
to be conscientious and exact in yielding Obe∣dience
to all the Laws and Commands of Ci∣vil
Rulers and Magistrates, whether they should
be Heathen or Christians, provided that those
Laws and Injunctions were not inconsistent
with, and repugnant to the Laws of God: So
he was <HI>Himself</HI> contented to <HI>Pay Tribute</HI> to <HI>Tibe∣rius
Caesar,</HI> who was both an <HI>Idolater</HI> and a <HI>Tyrant.</HI>
Nay, so far are the <HI>Bishops</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> from having
any Jurisdiction in the quality of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s
<HI>Successors,</HI> over the Dominions of any Prince
and Potentates whatsoever, That all the right
which they have to their own Temporal and
Secular Possessions, even to that which is vul∣garly
call'd the <HI>Patrimony</HI> of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> is by and
from the Concession and Grants of Potentates,
Kings, and Civil Rulers (among whom I wou'd
not be thought to place <HI>Constantine,</HI> whose pre∣tended
<HI>Donation</HI> is a meer <HI>Fiction</HI> and <HI>Chimera,</HI>
but some that were later than he) who were
more Liberal and Beneficent, than they were
Prudent and Wise. Moreover, tho' the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI>
have had sometimes, the weakness as well
as the vanity to <HI>Claim</HI> a <HI>right</HI> to the <HI>whole West-Indies,</HI>
thro' and by vertue of the Donation of
Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> VI. in his <HI>Bulls</HI> Dated 2d and
3d of <HI>May, Anno</HI> 1493, yet the very <HI>Spanish
Historians</HI> do assure us, that <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>Isa∣bella</HI>
who were King and Queen of <HI>Castile,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Her∣rera</HI>'s Hist. of the <HI>West-In∣dies.</HI> Dec. Lib. 1. 2. Cap 4.</NOTE> when
<HI>Columbus</HI> made the first discovery of the <HI>West-Indies</HI>
in the year 1492, having consulted with
those who were esteemed the most Learned in the
Civil and Canon Laws, <HI>thought it needless to use
any such Formality as to desire a Grant and Dona∣tion


<PB N="67" REF="50"/>
of those</HI> Countries from the Pope; and that
the <HI>Bulls</HI> of <HI>Alexander</HI> VI. were obtain'd, or
rather accepted upon some particular Conside∣rations.</P>
<P>Nor have divers Nations, and those Roman
Catholicks, as well as Reformed, made the least
scruple of sailing unto, and settling in the Re∣gions
and Countries of <HI>America,</HI> notwithstand∣ing
the <HI>Pope's Bulls,</HI> by which they are said to
have been granted to the Kings of <HI>Spain.</HI> See∣ing
besides what hath been done by divers Prin∣ces
and States during this whole present Cen∣tury,
and a good part of the former, whereof I
shall here make little or no mention (it being noto∣riously
and fully known, not only to every States∣man,
Scholar, Merchant, Shopkeeper and Artificer,
but to those who are the meanest Boors, Peasants,
and the ignorantest part of Mankind) there
were divers attempts and endeavours made by
others Trading to <HI>America</HI> immediately and
soon after the emission of those <HI>Bulls,</HI> upon
which some would found the <HI>Spaniard</HI>'s having
a right and claim, and legitimate Title to those
Dominions. For no longer than three years af∣ter
the pretended <HI>Donation</HI> of all the <HI>American
Territories</HI> to <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>Isabella, King</HI> and
<HI>Queen</HI> of <HI>Castile</HI> by <HI>Alexander</HI> VI. did <HI>Henry</HI> VII.
of <HI>England</HI> (tho' a zealous Roman Catholick,
and one who by reason of his Domestick Trou∣bles
stood in great need of the Favour of the
See of <HI>Rome,</HI> and who no less courted it) Equip
and set forth in the Year 1496, four Ships un∣der
the Command of Sir <HI>John,</HI> and Sir <HI>Sebastian
Cabet</HI> of <HI>Bristol,</HI> to discover, enter upon, and
take possession of any place or places of the

<PB N="68" REF="51"/>
of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> which by his Authority and
in his Name they did from 25 to 26 Degrees of
the Northern Latitude; and in two Voyages
which they made to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> they both
establish'd a Friendship and Trade with the <HI>Na∣tives</HI>
of <HI>Florida, Long-Island,</HI> and of divers pla∣ces
of those <HI>American</HI> Countries. And tho'
<HI>Henry</HI> VIII. who succeeded him (thro' his being
employ'd in Wars with <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
taken up about important affairs at home) could
not extend his Empire in the <HI>West-Indies;</HI> ne∣vertheless
there were, even in his Reign, divers
private Persons that voluntarily engag'd in the
making discoveries and settling Trade in <HI>Ame∣rica:</HI>
And among others whom we do find e∣quip'd
and sent forth upon this Design, were
<HI>Edward Spurstow,</HI> in the 5th and 9th Years of
<HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and <HI>Robert Warner</HI> in the 12th of the
same Reign, who made rich Voyages thither,
and were kindly entertain'd by the <HI>Natives.</HI>
And which is of affinity hereunto, and ex∣tremely
pertinent, for shewing the insignifican∣cy
of the foremention'd <HI>Bulls</HI> to the establishing
any right in the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to any other <HI>Parts</HI> of
<HI>America</HI> than they are actually in possession of;
it deserveth to be observ'd, how that <HI>Vespusius</HI>
a <HI>Florentine</HI> by order of <HI>Emanuel</HI> King of <HI>Portu∣gal,</HI>
did in the Year 1500, discover all <HI>Brasile,</HI>
which makes a large part of the <HI>American</HI> Con∣tinent,
and that the <HI>Portuguese</HI> asserted their
right unto it, and preserv'd a liberty of Tra∣ding
thither, notwithstanding all that was ob∣jected
to the contrary by <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>Isabella</HI>
of <HI>Castile.</HI> Whereunto should I add what hath
been done since, and that not only by the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>

Charles▪</HI> I. and II. but by the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI>
and by divers other Nations and States, which
have all traded to and settled several Colonies
both upon the <HI>Terra firma</HI> and the Islands of
<HI>America,</HI> notwithstanding either the <HI>Popes Bulls</HI> of
Donation of those Countries, and Islands to the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> or their pretensions unto them, by
any other Right or Title whatsoever; it would
evidently and unanswerably appear, that their
<HI>Claim</HI> to the <HI>West-Indies</HI> was never further al∣lowed
and admitted by any <HI>European Potentates</HI>
and <HI>Rulers,</HI> than in reference to those Places
and Territories of which they were become
actually possess'd. Yea the <HI>Pope</HI>'s grant of the

to the propagation of the Christian Faith
among those Infidels, The See of <HI>Rome</HI> chal∣lenging
no Power or Authority to dispose of
Earthly Dominions, save in relation thereunto,
and neither for destroying the Natives or usur∣ping
their Territories, it naturally follows that

New York, Carolina, Pensilvania, Jamaica,</HI> &amp;c.
which the <HI>English</HI> have there, besides what pla∣ces
are possess'd by others, especially by the
<HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> in that part of the World,
do abundantly shew, that all Nations do ac∣count
the <HI>Claim</HI> of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to the whole
<HI>West-Indies</HI> to be no better than a weak, vain
and chimerical Imagination, and that the <HI>Popes
Bulls</HI> by which it is alledged that they are enti∣tuled
thereunto, are no otherwise esteemed by <HI>Eu∣ropean
Princes and States,</HI> than as a Jest and Banter.</P>
<P>Nor, Finally, have the <HI>Spaniards</HI> themselves
paid that respect to the <HI>Bulls</HI> of <HI>Alexander</HI> VI.
which they should, and certainly would have
done, had they taken their right to the <HI>American</HI>
Islands and Dominions to be deriv'd from them:
Seeing whereas the same <HI>Pope</HI> had in and by these
very <HI>Bulls,</HI> not only confirmed unto the <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI>
their title to such places, as they were
not only possess'd of in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> but to
all other whatsoever in that <HI>Eastern quarter</HI> of
the <HI>World,</HI> for the Occupying and Inheriting
whereof they had formerly obtain'd <HI>Bulls</HI> of
other <HI>Pope<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and particularly of <HI>Eugenius</HI> IV.
excluding all others from trading thither, yet
notwithstanding of this, they of <HI>Castile</HI> laid
Claim to the <HI>Moluccao Islands,</HI> to which <HI>Ferdi∣nand
Magelanus</HI> had found a passage by the
South-West of <HI>America,</HI> and continu'd to assert
and defend their Pretensions to them, until
<HI>John</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> by lending the <HI>Emperor
Charles</HI> V. 350000 Ducats, upon condition, that
He and his Heirs should forbear trading to the
<HI>Molucca's</HI> till the Money were repaid; they de∣clin'd


<PB N="74" REF="52"/>
the maintaining their Title to those
Islands, and laid aside their trading to them.</P>
<P>Nor is it unworthy of remark, as well for
the chicane as the pleasantry, and divertise∣ment
of it, that the <HI>Pope</HI> having divided the
new World into two <HI>Hemispheres,</HI> allotting
the <HI>Western</HI> to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and the <HI>Eastern</HI> to the
<HI>Portuguese,</HI> how that they coming to disagree
about their <HI>respective Shares,</HI> each of them lay∣ing
claim (as I have said before) to the <HI>Mo∣lucca
Islands,</HI> as falling by that division within
their Portion, and the decision of the case,
seeming to depend upon Mathematical Calcula∣tions,
about which the men of skill in <HI>Geography,</HI>
being consulted on both sides, the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
and <HI>Portuguese</HI> did in reference thereunto, dif∣fer
from one another almost <HI>Forty degrees,</HI> in
their fixing of the <HI>Longitude,</HI> and so dogma∣tical
and obstinate were both in their accounts,
that orders were given by publick Edicts, for
fixing the <HI>Degrees</HI> and <HI>Meridians,</HI> in their se∣veral
<HI>Charts</HI> and <HI>Maps,</HI> as they had been diffe∣rently
determined by the two Nations.</P>
<P>Finally that which still shews a further slight
put upon those <HI>Bulls,</HI> by the very <HI>Spaniards</HI>
themselves is this, namely, that no sooner had
<HI>Americus Vespusius</HI> discover'd the <HI>South Sea,</HI> and
found store of Excellent Timber, for buil∣ding
of Ships, near to an excellent Port, that
was but one league distant from that Sea,
and which <HI>Vespusius</HI> called <HI>Ralio,</HI> then that ha∣ving
immediately built two
Ships there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Mariana's</HI> hist. of <HI>Spain</HI> lib 26. cap. 2. and <HI>Herrera's</HI> hist. of the <HI>West Indies</HI> dec. 2d. lib. 6. a capite 3. ad cap. 9.</NOTE> he sailed from
thence to the Northern parts
of the <HI>East Indies,</HI> and begun
in the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>5th.</HI> to settle a <HI>Colony</HI>
there upon one of those <HI>Islands,</HI> which afterwards


<PB N="72" REF="53"/>
upon the perfecting of that Plantation in the
time of <HI>Philip</HI> the <HI>2d.</HI> came to be called the
<HI>Philippine Islands,</HI> where to this day they have a
<HI>Colony,</HI> and keep possession of them in scorn and
contempt of the <HI>Pope's Bulls,</HI> by which all the <HI>East-Indies</HI>
were granted to the Portuguese.</P>
<P>The <HI>Third</HI> and last thing that I would <HI>premise</HI>
upon this occasion, and in order to the clearer
determination of the point in dispute, is, that
whatsoever right of propriety, and dominion
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> may <HI>have,</HI> by the Title and upon
the foot of Conquest acquired in and over the
<HI>Empires</HI> of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> and such <HI>Countries</HI>
and <HI>Provinces,</HI> that were <HI>dependent</HI> upon, <HI>Subject</HI>
and <HI>Tributary</HI> unto those two <HI>Empires,</HI> yet they
cannot thereby have <HI>obtained</HI> and <HI>Jurisdiction
Title</HI> or <HI>Claim</HI> of possession over, in, and to those
<HI>regions, districts</HI> and <HI>places</HI> of <HI>America</HI> which as
they have never <HI>Subdued,</HI> so they of those pla∣ces
were not nor at any time had been in
<HI>Vassallage</HI> or <HI>Subjection</HI> to the <HI>Monarchs</HI> and <HI>So∣veraign
Rulers</HI> of either of those <HI>Empires.</HI> I could
very justly have laid down the <HI>Postulatum,</HI> and
proposition more at large, and at the same time
been able to justify it both by <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Au∣thority,</HI>
and to have proved and made it good,
as well by <HI>Artificial</HI> as <HI>Inartificial Arguments:</HI>
namely that whatsoever <HI>Legal right,</HI> the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI>
may have acquired to those <HI>Lands</HI> and
<HI>Territories</HI> in <HI>America</HI> of which they are posses∣sed,
by the <HI>claim</HI> and upon the foot of <HI>prescri∣ption</HI>
thro' their having Inhabited, occupied and
inherited them for above 200 years, without
interruption, disseisure, or dispossession; yet they
never <HI>obtained</HI> a Lawful and righteous <HI>Title</HI> un∣to,
or a Legal Jurisdiction over them, upon
the <HI>basis</HI> and <HI>foundation</HI> of having Conquered the


<PB N="75" REF="53"/>
<HI>Mexican</HI> and <HI>Peruvian Emperors</HI> and <HI>Empires</HI> in
and by a Just <HI>War,</HI> but that they rather sub∣dued,
and destroyed those <HI>Monarchs,</HI> and <HI>Posses∣sed</HI>
themselves of their <HI>Dominions,</HI> by Fraud,
Violence and Usurpation. Now <HI>Puffendorf</HI> tells
us, and that agreeably to the opinion of all
<HI>Civilians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dissertat academ. Select. p. 293.</NOTE> that <HI>per solam vim injustam, non posse
alicui Solidum Jus quaeri, &amp; cui exadversum, ob∣ligatio
conscientiam stringens respondeat, nisi viti∣um
acquisitionis purgatum fuerit per accidentem post
novam causam quae per se jus parere idonea est.</HI> No
right is acquired, or doth arise or accrue to any,
by the alone and single means of unjust Violence
and Force; nor do a People become obliged
and bound in conscience to pay Fealty, and Al∣legiance,
and to yield Obedience to such, as
have Unrighteously and without Cause, or
Provocation, Overpowered and Master'd them,
unless and until something else doth interpose
and intervene, that may create and give a Ti∣tle,
and right of Domination, Rule and Autho∣rity
unto the <HI>Former</HI> and beget ties of legal
Subjection and Obedience in the latter. For as
<HI>Grotius</HI> affirms to the same purpose, That <HI>Actus
Imperij invasoris quos exercet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">De Jure Bell, &amp; pac. <HI>lib. 1. cap.</HI> 4.</NOTE> <HI>nullam vim habere

Invader meerly as such, and under that redu∣plication
hath a right of exacting Fealty and

whom they have without Justice violently and
forcibly assaulted. That <HI>Quicquid Jure posside∣tur,

upon the minds of all men, as a part of the

and that they are under Laws

that the Wars which the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI>
made upon the <HI>Emperors</HI>
of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See also what <HI>Mar. Gina∣mi</HI> hath in his Italian translati∣of <HI>de las Casas</HI> Book, particular∣ly in that part called <HI>Conqui∣sta dell' Indie.</HI></NOTE> and upon
such <HI>Supreme Rulers</HI> and <HI>Gover∣nours</HI>
of those other <HI>American
Territories</HI> and <HI>Countries</HI> where∣of
they are become possessed, were the most
groundless, unrighteous and unjust, as well as
the most bloody inhumane and barbarous, that
ever were either begun, or carried on in any
part of the World: Seeing that tho' those Po∣tentates,
Rulers, and their People and Subjects
were not <HI>Christians</HI> (and for any thing that we
do know, were never provided of means nor
furnished with advantages of being such) yet
they were as Lawful Kings, Princes, and Go∣vernours
of their several and respective Domi∣nions,
Territories, and Districts in <HI>America,</HI>
and as Legal Proprietors of their Demesns and
Possessions there, as any <HI>European Prince</HI> or <HI>Peo∣ple</HI>
whatsoever are in reference either unto the
Authority and Jurisdiction, which they have and
do exercise in this part of the Terrestrial Globe,
or to the Lands and Goods where they do here
inhabit, and which they do enjoy and possess. For
Infidels being rational Creatures, as well as other
men are, they are thereupon Sociable, as well
as they, and consequently capable of entring
into Societies, and agreeing upon Laws for the
Government of them; and indeed to have Go∣vernours
and to be Governed, are equally co∣mon
to all sorts of men, whether they Wor∣ship
God or Idols, being things that have


<PB N="75" REF="54"/>
their foundation in the light of Nature, and
not in Revelation. And therefore, Civil Do∣minion
and Property, being no ways founded
in Grace, or in the <HI>Orthodoxy</HI> of <HI>Faith,</HI> but in
Principles of Nature which guide men to pro∣vide
for their own safety, it is as much a viola∣tion
of the Laws of God, and of Nations, to
Invade the Countries of those Soveraigns and
to deprive those Potentates of their Domini∣ons,
without a previous and antecedent just
reason and cause, and it is as heinous an of∣fence,
against the Laws both of Nature and Re∣velation
to rob and plunder their People of
what they had and enjoyed, as it is for any one
King and people in this Christian part of the
World to do the like against and upon any
other in this <HI>Hemisphere,</HI> and who are of the
same belief of the Gospel that they who In∣vade
them are.</P>
<P>Nor have there hitherto been, nor hereafter
can, any reasons be produc'd, for <HI>legitimating</HI>
and <HI>justifying</HI> the War of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> upon
and against the natural <HI>Princes</HI> and the <HI>Natives</HI>
of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> but which do with greater
evidence proclaim, and more singularly aggra∣vate
and enhance the guilt of it. For to al∣ledge
that they were <HI>Idolaters,</HI> and that there∣fore
it was lawful, to make War upon, and
to destroy and extirpate them, is directly re∣pugnant
to all the Principles of Humanity,
the Maxims of Evangelical Meekness, and the
Methods establish'd by our Lord JESUS Christ
for the Propagation of the Christian Faith;
as well as to all the Laws of Nature, Revela∣tion
and Nations. And as the time once was,
when all the Nations even of <HI>Europe, Asia</HI> and


<PB N="76" REF="55"/>
<HI>Africk,</HI> save the single and l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttle <HI>People</HI> of the
<HI>Jews,</HI> were gross and open <HI>Idolaters;</HI> so I do
not believe that any are so far void of good
<HI>Sense,</HI> and of humane Sentiments, as to think
that the <HI>Jews,</HI> had they been powerful enough
to have attempted it, stood warranted and au∣thorized
to have depopulated the Earth, thro'
destroying the Inhabitants of it. And consi∣dering
how the same Character of being <HI>Idolaters</HI>
is by most of those of all Countries that are stiled
<HI>Reformed</HI> fasten'd upon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> themselves,
because of divers Religious Actions in their Pon∣tifician
Worship, it is not therefore to consult
well for their own safety, to invest those who
do both believe and call them so, with a right
of Slaughtering and Murdering them upon that
account.</P>
<P>And whereas it may possibly be pretended,
that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had just cause administer'd
unto them, of making War upon the <HI>Indians,</HI>
even almost to the extripating of them, in that
the <HI>Potentates</HI> and <HI>People</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> would not
admit them to <HI>Trade</HI> and reside peaceably among
them: It is as irrational and barbarous an Al∣legation
as the former, and is withal uncon∣troulably
false with respect to matter of <HI>Fact,</HI>
which the other was not. For abstracting from
the question, whether one People may not law∣fully
exclude and debar another from Traf∣ficking
with them, and settling in their Coun∣try,
which why it may not be done in other
Cases, besides that of open Hostility, I will not
at this time take upon me to decide; but that
which I do affirm, is, That the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had
no provocation of that kind given them for
their making War upon the <HI>Natives.</HI> It be∣ing


<PB N="77" REF="55"/>
declared and recorded by their own <HI>Histo∣rians</HI>
and Writers, that the <HI>Indians</HI> receiv'd
them chearfully, and treated them amicably,
and entertain'd them according to all the rules
of Hospitality and Friendship; yea, both well∣com'd
and esteem'd them rather as Gods than as
Men, until the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> by their Barbarities
perpetrated upon the <HI>Natives,</HI> provoked them
to seek and endeavour, how to preserve and
defend themselves from their brutal and hellish
Rage. So that, tho' there be not the least
shadow of truth in that pretence for the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
having made War for Forty Years suc∣cessively,
used all the Arts of Fraud, Treache∣ry
and Violence, for destroying and extermi∣nating
them, which they so far effected, as to
Murder above <HI>Forty Millions</HI> of Men, Women,
and Children, to the laying waste some of the
largest and finest Countries in the World, and
the rendring them in a manner destitute of In∣habitants;
yet the folly and impertinence of
those who produce this as a reason, and in ju∣stification
of the War that was made upon the
<HI>Indians,</HI> are too obvious and remarkable to be
overlook'd, and silently omitted: Seeing by the
same reason, and upon the same motive, that
they seek and endeavour, to have the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
either excused or justified in what they did a∣gainst
the <HI>Natives</HI> of <HI>America;</HI> an <HI>European Na∣tion</HI>
that hath Strength and Power enough to
fall upon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in their <HI>West-India Pro∣vinces,</HI>
and is able to drive them thence, be∣comes
warranted and authorized to do it, in
that it is their avowed principle and practice,
to permit none to Plant and Trade there besides
themselves.</P>
<P>

<PB N="78" REF="56"/>
So that it being apparent from the whole,
that hath been said under this Head, that the
War which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made against the <HI>Ru∣lers</HI>
and <HI>Inhabitants</HI> of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> who were
the Ancient <HI>Natives,</HI> was, upon all accounts,
most unrighteous and unjust, it doth from thence
unanswerably follow, That no Title in those
Dominions can arise and accrue unto them,
from their having been <HI>Victors</HI> and <HI>Conquerors</HI>
in that War. It being impossible that what is
lawful and just, should be the natural, proper
and immediate effect of what is in it self, Wic∣ked,
Abominable and Villainous. And therefore
such of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Nation as have
been wise and honest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>de las Casas</HI> ac∣count of the Voyages and Discoveries of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the <HI>West-In∣dies,</HI> from p. 136 to 161 of the <HI>English</HI> Transla∣tion.</NOTE> they do re∣nounce
all claim of Right in the
Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> to a Soveraignity
and Jurisdiction over those Coun∣tries,
and the having a legal pro∣perty
in them, on the Foot and
Foundation of <HI>Conquest,</HI> and are willing to
place and settle it on the <HI>bottom</HI> of their own
<HI>Occupation</HI> and <HI>Possession,</HI> and quiet acquiescence
of the <HI>Natives.</HI> And indeed when <HI>Columbus</HI> had
first discover'd the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and was about
to establish <HI>Colonies</HI> in those Provinces, and be∣ing
at his second Voyage to <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> advised
by some of his own People, and particularly
by one Father <HI>Boyle,</HI> to sieze upon <HI>Guacanagari,</HI>
that was an <HI>Indian</HI> King, and stood accused for
having Murder'd some <HI>Castilians,</HI> whom <HI>Colum∣bus</HI>
had left there upon his first Voyage thither,
he not only refus'd to do it, but declar'd that
he came not into those Countries upon a <HI>Design
of using Force,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Herre∣ra dec. 1. li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 2. c. 9.</NOTE> <HI>nor in order to make a Conquest, but
in a peaceable and gentle way, and to settle with the
consent of the Natives.</HI></P>
<P>

<PB N="79" REF="56"/>
In brief, tho' neither any crimes against God,
wherewith the <HI>Indians</HI> were chargeable, nor
any undue and inhumane carriages towards the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> at their first Landing in <HI>America,</HI>
whereof some have had both the Impudence
and Indiscretion to accuse them, were either
just motives according to the Morals of Hea∣thens
or Christians, or allowable by the Laws
of Nations, as Lawful causes for the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
making War upon that People, yet both the
<HI>occasions</HI> of it on the part of the <HI>Natives,</HI> and
the real Inducements unto it on the side of
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> are too obvious and apparent, to
escape the Observation and Notice of any per∣son,
that is conversant in History. Namely,
that the Simplicity, Meekness, Patience and
Unacquaintedness with Arms, and Martial Dis∣cipline,
and their being ill provided of Wea∣pons,
either Offensive or Defensive, together
with their abounding with Wealth, and their
Countries being stored with Gold and Silver
Mines, were the true <HI>occasions</HI> of that War,
on the side of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and an insatiable
<HI>Avarice,</HI> a Brutal Insolence, and unquencha∣ble
thirst after Blood, were the real causes of
it, on the part of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> who under
all their pretences, of converting those Infidels
to the Christian Faith and Worship,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> De las Casas ubi Supra, <HI>thro' the whole Book.</HI></NOTE> intended
principally if not only, the destroying and
extirpating of them, and converting their
Countries and their Treasures to their own
use.</P>
<P>Whereunto may be further added under this
head, that the Murther of the <HI>Emperours</HI> of <HI>Mexi∣co</HI>
and <HI>Peru,</HI> and the destroying all such as were
of the Royal Lines, of those two great Monarchical


<PB N="80" REF="57"/>
Families, which was perpetrated against all the
measures and obligations of Gratitude, Truth,
Honour, Equity and Justice, and with all the
Treachery and Inhumanity imaginable, gave no
<HI>Legal Jurisdiction</HI> to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> over such
as had been Subjects or Vassals to those Sove∣raigns,
in that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did not set them∣selves
up, and lay claim to an Authority, in
order to <HI>Govern</HI> the <HI>Mexicans</HI> and <HI>Peruvians,</HI>
to their Advantage and Benefit, but that they
might extirpate and exterminate them. And
Governments being at first instituted, for the
safety of a People and not for their ruine:
Kings being as <HI>Aristotle</HI> saith, <HI>ordained for the
good of Kingdoms, and not Kingdoms for the Lust
and Pleasure of Kings, to be Tyrannized over as
they will,</HI> such can never acquire any right to
Rule and Govern a Country, whose design
work and endeavour were to depopulate it.
And if on the supposition, that it were pos∣sible
for one, that is a Legitimate Soveraign
and Monarch, to entertain a purpose of ma∣king
an Universal destruction of his People,
instead of Protecting them (which I do really
think and believe no Prince whatsoever is ca∣pable
of, who is not fitter for Bedlam than a
Throne, and who needeth not rather to be
Bound in Chains, than to be accounted fit to
sway a Scepter, as being more Mad and Di∣stracted,
than any that are kept at <HI>Hogsden)</HI>
it were Lawful for his very Subjects, without
the Violation of their Allegiance, to restrain
and resist him; Surely then it ought much
more to be esteemed, not only Lawful but an
indispensible Duty, to withstand and oppose
those, to whom they had never been Subjects,


<PB N="81" REF="57"/>
paid Fealty, or yielded Obedience, that should
challenge an Authority and Jurisdiction over
them, meerly that they might in the exercise
thereof, Massacre and Exterminate them,
which was directly the case of the <HI>People</HI> of
the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> in relation to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
both at their first Landing among them,
and for a long series of Years after. So that
this serveth to Vindicate from blame, not on∣ly
all those few and small <HI>Retaliations,</HI> which any
of the <HI>Native Indians</HI> were capable of making
upon the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in Killing them whereso∣ever
they could conveniently find, and were
strong enough to Master them; but it doth a∣bundantly
<HI>justify</HI> the <HI>withdrawment</HI> of all those
that could, from a <HI>dependence</HI> upon the <HI>Em∣pires</HI>
of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> as they are now be∣come
vested in the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> tho' they
had been anciently either Subjects, or Vassals,
or Feudatories unto them, and their erecting
themselves into Free, Absolute and Independent
Governments, that thereby instead of falling
under, and being forced to submit to the <HI>Spa∣nish</HI>
Jurisdiction, they might be the better a∣ble
to withstand their power, and to defend
themselves against all the pretensions of the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> in their claim of Authority over
them. And if the length of time, wherein
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have not only been in the quiet
possession, but in the exercise of Rule and
Government, over such and such <HI>West-India</HI> Pro∣vinces,
Countries and Districts, that have, ei∣ther
actively, or passively, submitted to them,
gives them a Title thereunto by <HI>Prescription,</HI>
then certainly by parity of Reason, and on the
same foot of account, are they who (upon the


<PB N="82" REF="58"/>
<HI>Spaniards</HI> getting into <HI>Possession</HI> of <HI>Mexico</HI> and
<HI>Peru,</HI> and there treating of the Natives in the
manner above related) withdrew themselves
from any further <HI>Dependence</HI> on those <HI>Empires,</HI>
and became erected into distinct, free and in∣dependent
<HI>Governments,</HI> made likewise entitled
to there <HI>Possessions,</HI> and <HI>Jurisdictions,</HI> by the same
tenor and claim of <HI>Prescription.</HI> Nor is it to
be denied, but that there are several Societies
and bodies of <HI>Indians</HI> within the ancient Pre∣cincts
and Limits of the foresaid <HI>Empires,</HI> who to
this day, instead of submitting to the Jurisdiction
of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> are in continual and constant
War with them. Whereof though a Multitude
of Instances might be assigned, yet for the sake
of Brevity, I shall only mention two. Of which
one shall be the Collection or Herd of <HI>Indians,</HI>
within the bounds of the Kingdom of <HI>Guati∣mala,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Gage</HI>'s Survey edi. 1699. <HI>p.</HI> 160, 161. and 305.</NOTE>
whom the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have not hitherto
Conquered, but would fain subdue, in order
both to the setling a Commerce with some
parts of <HI>Jucatan,</HI> from the doing whereof they
are hindred by those Natives, and for the o∣pening
a way, for the conveying their goods
over Land to the <HI>Havana,</HI> which they reckon
would be often more for their safety,
than the venturing them thither by Sea, from
the <HI>Gulph.</HI> The other which I would menti∣on
is, that <HI>Sept</HI> and <HI>Tribe</HI> of <HI>Indians,</HI> who re∣main
imbodied on the <HI>Northern</HI> part of the
Province of New <HI>Mexico,</HI> who are both Vali∣ant,
and in implacable Hostility with the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI>
and whom they are more desirous to
bring into Subjection, than any other that are
unsubdued, because of the rich Gold and Sil∣ver
Mines, which they know to lie in the
Mountains, and within the Districts which those


<PB N="83" REF="58"/>
Natives possess, where they have hitherto co∣vered
and defended themselves, against the pow∣er
of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, if the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> cannot right∣fully
pretend unto any Soveraignty over those,
whom I have mention'd, it is then <HI>Apodictically</HI>
evident, that thro' their having master'd <HI>Mexi∣co</HI>
and <HI>Peru,</HI> and got into possession of those
<HI>Empires,</HI> (and by reason of a long and quiet
Occupation, are come to be universally ac∣knowledg'd
to have a Right in them, so far
as they are possess'd, and submitted unto by
the Natives) they can lay no <HI>Claim</HI> of <HI>Title,</HI> Au∣thority
or Jurisdiction whatsoever, unto and over
such Places and People, who, as they never were
in any way or manner dependant upon, or Feu∣datory
to the foremention'd Empires; so they
were never subdued by, nor yielded any Fealty
or Obedience to the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> but instead
thereof have all along been either in terms of
<HI>Hostility,</HI> or in actual War with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
and have defended themselves, and preserved
their <HI>Territories</HI> from being over-run, subdued,
occupyed, and inhabited by them. Which is
the plain and direct <HI>Case</HI> of those of that part
of the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> where the <HI>Scots,</HI> with
<HI>consent</HI> of the <HI>Natives,</HI> and of their Rulers, have
<HI>Landed,</HI> and are about setling a <HI>Colony.</HI></P>
<P>And this doth both conduct me more near∣ly,
and let me in more closely to the Matter
and Affair, which my design in the writing of
this Discourse, is to vindicate and justify;
namely, That the <HI>Scots</HI> in their endeavouring to
establish their <HI>Colony</HI> at <HI>Caledonia,</HI> at the <HI>Port,</HI>
and upon the <HI>Harbour Acla</HI> in the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of
<HI>Darien;</HI> have made no Invasion upon the Do∣minions,
Territories, or Demesns of His <HI>Ca∣tholick


<PB N="84" REF="59"/>
Majesty,</HI> nor have thereby done any thing
which may be call'd an <HI>Infraction</HI> of, <HI>Treati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>
and <HI>Alliances</HI> between the <HI>Crowns</HI> of <HI>Great Bri∣tain</HI>
and of <HI>Spain.</HI> Now that I may manage
this undertaking, both with all the Perspicuity,
and with all the Candor imaginable, I shall
freely grant unto the <HI>Spaniards</HI> whatsoever in
Justice and Reason should not be deny'd them:
That I may the more methodically, the better,
and with the less offence to any afterwards de∣ny
unto them such Pretensions and Claims, as
they have no grounds, either in Laws, or in
Compacts and Stipulations for the demanding
of. I do therefore willingly and with great rea∣diness
allow them to have a <HI>Title</HI> unto, and a
<HI>Propriety</HI> in <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> and such other
<HI>Provinces</HI> and <HI>Islands</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> where they
have Plantations and <HI>Colonies,</HI> to such dimen∣sions,
so far, and to that extent of limits and
bounds, as they do actually occupy and are in the
possession of. For notwithstanding that their en∣trance
into, and first settlement in those Coun∣tries,
was mostly in the way of Force, Vio∣lence
and Usurpation, and accompany'd with
the greatest Barbarities, horridest Cruelties,
and most execrable Massacres which it was possi∣ble
for Men to practise, commit and perpe∣trate;
from, and by which no just and legal
<HI>Title</HI> could result and accrue unto them in and
over those Territories, as I have already said, yet
thro' their having for so long, and for such an
uninterrupted series of Years, peaceaby <HI>possessed</HI>
and <HI>inhabited</HI> such and such places in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI>
there is from thence, according to the
Laws of Nations, a <HI>Title</HI> risen unto and become
vested in them by <HI>Prescription</HI> over these Pro∣vinces,


<PB N="85" REF="59"/>
Isles, and Districts, that unless in the
case of actual War, none may or can disturb,
disseize or expel them, without the doing that
which is unlawful, unjust, injurious, and high∣ly
Criminal. For if <HI>Prescription</HI> should not be
acknowledg'd to create and give unto a Prince
or People a Title to a Country, Province, or
Territory, so far as he or they may have been
possessed of them; and if a peaceable and un∣disturb'd
<HI>Occupation</HI> for an hundred or two hun∣dred
Years be not confessed sufficient time to
found <HI>Prescription</HI> upon, the Right of many
Princes, as well as of Common Men, would be
very questionable to what they call their Inhe∣ritances,
and Matter and Cause would thereby
be administred, of Bloody Wars as well as of
litigious and expensive Sutes in Courts of Law,
both between Rulers, and between private Sub∣jects,
in most places in the World.</P>
<P>But whereas upon this <HI>Concession</HI> which I have
made, it may possibly be said and alledged by
some, that thro' the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having a right
of Soveraignity and Dominion in and over
<HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> they must consequently be
own'd to have a <HI>legal Title</HI> to all the <HI>Provinces,
Districts,</HI> and <HI>Places,</HI> that had been formerly,
and particularly at the <HI>Castilians</HI> landing in
<HI>America,</HI> were parts of, <HI>Feudatory</HI> unto, or any
ways <HI>dependant</HI> upon those <HI>Empires:</HI> It being a
Maxim in the <HI>English,</HI> as well as in all other Laws,
<HI>That the Possession of a part in a Person or Per∣sons
that have the Right, gives unto them a just
Claim of Possession to the whole.</HI> Whereunto the
Answers that may be given are obvious from
what hath been offer'd and laid down in the
foregoing <HI>Postulata</HI> and <HI>Premises;</HI> namely, first,


<PB N="86" REF="60"/>
That the whole imported in that <HI>Maxim,</HI> doth
only refer unto, and obtain in reference to such,
who had been, and were the legal and rightful,
Proprietors of such and such Dominions and
Territories, or who had thro' a Conquest in a
just War, cut out and made a <HI>Title</HI> to them∣selves
by their Swords; whereas it signifieth
nothing, nor is of any validity to the giving
a legal Claim and Title unto, and over any
parts of a Country, further than as they are
actually occupyed and possessed, to those who
neither had ancient Propriety in and over those
Dominions, nor had come to acquire any in
way of Conquest by a just War. Which be∣ing
the plain and direct case of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
even in relation to the <HI>Empires</HI> of <HI>Mexico</HI> and
<HI>Peru;</HI> it may therefore be affirm'd, and that
consonantly both to all the Rules of Laws, and
the Measures of Equity and Justice, and that
from the <HI>Castilians</HI> having inhumanely, savagely,
and treacherously Murder'd the <HI>Emperors</HI> of <HI>Mexico</HI>
and <HI>Peru,</HI> and the having destroy'd all those of
each of those Imperial <HI>Lines</HI> as they could byfraud
or violence get within the circle of their Power,
and their having set themselves to Slaughter,
Massacre and Exterminate the Natives, as far as
their might and strength, excited and influen∣ced
by Malice, Rage, Avarice, and insatiable
thirst after Blood could extend and reach; I
say it may be affirm'd, that from thence and
thereupon no Right or Title of Propriety or
Dominion did arise unto the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in and
over those Empires, further than they came
quietly to inhabit, and were submitted unto;
but that rather thereupon the <HI>Natives</HI> of those
two Empires were at liberty to account these


<PB N="87" REF="60"/>
two great <HI>Monarchies</HI> to be entirely <HI>dissolv'd,</HI>
and might reckon that <HI>they themselves</HI> were in
effect reduc'd back again to the <HI>State of Nature,</HI>
and that whatsoever <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> had
either by primitive <HI>Compacts</HI> and <HI>Agreements,</HI>
or by tacit <HI>Submissions</HI> been vested in those
<HI>Monarchs,</HI> and their <HI>Hereditary Successors,</HI> was
become wholly <HI>vacated</HI> and <HI>annulled,</HI> not only
as to them and their legal Heirs, but to all
such who should pretend to arise and set up
in their room, in the vertue of any Claim re∣sulting
from their having destroy'd and mur∣der'd
those <HI>Monarchs;</HI> and that the Power and
Jurisdiction of the ancient Emperors of <HI>Mexico</HI>
and <HI>Peru</HI> being altogether extinguish'd, there
was thereby a <HI>Right</HI> as well as a <HI>Freedom restor'd</HI>
unto and <HI>divolv'd</HI> upon the <HI>Natives,</HI> of dispo∣sing
themselves, how, to whom, and after what
manner they pleas'd, so that they might choose
what Governors, and erect what Government
they would, in order to their being kept in
peace and safety among themselves, and be
protected and defended from and against all
such as should hostilely invade them.</P>
<P>So that whosoever of those <HI>Indians,</HI> who
had formerly been dependant upon and subject
unto the Empires of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> did, for
the reasons I have mention'd, <HI>withdraw</HI> them∣selves
from being for the future any ways un∣der
those Empires, or any parts or branches
of them, and became <HI>united</HI> and <HI>confederated</HI>
into distinct, separate and independant <HI>Commu∣nities,</HI>
erecting <HI>Governments,</HI> and choosing <HI>Go∣vernors</HI>
of their own; As the <HI>Spaniards</HI> can law∣fully
pretend to no legal Claim of Right and
Authority over them; so it is not only free


<PB N="88" REF="61"/>
for those <HI>Indians</HI> to <HI>admit</HI> any <HI>European</HI> or other
Nation to come, and to settle, and to plant
among them, but they may upon the motive
and guidance of their own Interest, as well in∣vite
as receive any sort of People to plant and
reside among them, that shall shew themselves
willing, and who may be able to assist those
Natives against the <HI>Spaniards</HI> who make War up∣on
and seek to oppress them.</P>
<P><HI>For as</HI> Civilians <HI>do generally agree,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. Puf∣fen. de jur. Nat. ad Gent. lib. 8. c. 6. §. 25, 26.</NOTE> Si popu∣lus

<HI>To which purpose</HI> Grotius <HI>says from</HI> Pomponius,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. Grot. de Jure Bell. &amp; Pac. lib. 3. c. 9. §. 13.</NOTE>

No length of time wherein an Vsurper
possesseth, can vest him in a rightful Jurisdiction
and Dominion, while he wants the consent in some
manner intimated of those that were the first legal
Inheritors, and that their very silence is enough to
shew their refusal of becoming Subjects, when their
circumstances are such, that they dare not express
their disclaiming his Soveragnity over them. <HI>For
in some cases it is enough that they murmur,
tho' they dare not express their hatred; seeing
that they do not resist, is not because they
would not, but by reason that they cannot;
and their being tame and silent under a</HI> Force,
<HI>which they can neither withstand nor throw
off, do no more declare and express their sub∣mission,
than a Man approves of his being
robb'd, when without contradiction or quar∣relling,
he delivers his Purse to a Thief whom
he knows to be too strong for him.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, Secondly, it may be farther added in
way of answer, That the whole which can be
suppos'd to follow upon, and to result from
the foremention'd <HI>Maxim</HI> in Law, is only that
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> may thereupon and from thence
pretend to a <HI>Title</HI> of Right in, and of Dominion
over all such <HI>Places</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> as had anci∣ently
been either directly and immediately
subject to, or by one way or another depen∣dant
upon the foremention'd Empires; but it
doth in no manner concern or affect the set∣tlement
of the <HI>Scots</HI> on the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI>
nor can it be pleaded as a reason for giving
disturbance to their <HI>Caledonian Colony.</HI> Foras∣much


<PB N="90" REF="62"/>
as the Country of <HI>Darien,</HI> had never been
any <HI>part</HI> of, nor any ways <HI>Feudatory</HI> or tribu∣tary
unto, nor in any manner whatsoever <HI>de∣pendant</HI>
upon either of the foresaid <HI>Empires,</HI>
but was always a distinct, free, and indepen∣dent
Country, and the Natives and Inhabitants
thereof, a distinct, free and independent Peo∣ple.
Nor hath the place of that <HI>Isthmus,</HI> where
the <HI>Scots</HI> are particularly landed, and have be∣gun
to erect <HI>Forts,</HI> and do purpose to establish
a <HI>Colony</HI> for Trade and Commerce, been ever
subdued or inhabited by the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> To
which may be further added, That as the <HI>Di∣strict</HI>
on that <HI>Isthmus</HI> where the <HI>Scots</HI> have be∣gun
their settlement was never dependant up∣on
any part or place, where the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have
their <HI>Colonies</HI> within the <HI>Isthmus,</HI> so the Ruling
Natives of that little circuit where the <HI>Scots</HI>
are, and of whom they have obtain'd liberty
to settle and plant, were never subject to any
other <HI>Indian</HI> Sovereign or Government within
the Precincts of the <HI>Isthmus.</HI></P>
<P>Which leads me to a second <HI>Concession,</HI> that
I am oblig'd to make unto the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> but
whereof that they can have no advantages, for
the weakening or rendring controvertible a
right and legal Power and Liberty in the <HI>Scots</HI>
to settle on the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> I shall give
uncontradictable Reasons, and those such as
shall be founded both upon <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Facts.</HI>
That which I do then further grant unto them,
is this, namely, That besides the many large
and numerous <HI>Colonies</HI> which the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI>
hath in divers other places of <HI>America,</HI> they
have also several of very great importance and
profit, within and upon the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien.</HI>


<PB N="91" REF="62"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeing the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are not only the undoub∣ted
<HI>Masters</HI> of several places on the <HI>Bay</HI> of
<HI>Panama,</HI> and of the Coast of the <HI>Isthmus</HI> upon
and towards the <HI>South-Sea;</HI> but they do like∣wise
possess <HI>Carthagena,</HI> which stands on a small
Island, and <HI>Porto bello</HI> which is upon the Con∣tinent
upon the <HI>North-Sea.</HI> Yea, I do more∣over
acknowledge, that besides their having
heretofore possessed <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> and their
having <HI>Planted</HI> upon some part of the <HI>River
Darien</HI> it self, which are places nearer and more
adjacent to that little District and spot of Land,
where the <HI>Scots</HI> have begun to settle, than
those already mention'd, but which they have
since relinquish'd, and are wholly withdrawn
from: They have likewise at this very time
some small Territories in their <HI>Occupation</HI> which
are not remov'd and distanc'd much above <HI>ten</HI>
or <HI>twelve Lěagnes</HI> from the <HI>Caledonian Colony</HI> and
<HI>New Edenburgh,</HI> where they are in the <HI>possession</HI>
of <HI>Mines,</HI> out of which they dig <HI>Gold:</HI> In re∣ference
to all which places, as their Title and
Right of Propriety is readily confess'd by the
<HI>Scots,</HI> as well as legally asserted by themselves;
so neither the <HI>Scots</HI> nor any other Nation
whatsoever, unless in case of open Hostility in
a just War, can invade them there, or seek to
dispossess them from thence, without incurring
the guilt of great Injustice, and becoming vio∣lators
of the Laws of Nations. Nevertheless
nothing of all this, that I have granted, can
or ought to be reasonably alledged as a legal
plea against, a legitimate obstruction unto, or
a lawful hindrance of the <HI>Scots</HI> establishing a
<HI>Colony</HI> at the <HI>Port Acla,</HI> or the rendring it in∣jurious
and criminal in them, and an Infraction


<PB N="92" REF="63"/>
of Alliances, to possess, with the consent of
the Natives, the Country bordering upon, and
neigbouring unto it. Seeing the Equity and
Justice of what they have therein done, are
easie to be demonstrated from and by all the
<HI>Topicks</HI> of Law, Reason, and Fact, upon which
the settlement of Colonies by Aliens, Foreig∣ners,
or Strangers, in any parts of the World,
have been accounted lawful, and do in the esteem
of Nations stand justify'd.</P>
<P>In order to the better and fuller clearing
whereof, it may not be amiss to observe, That
neither antecedently in the discovery of that
part of <HI>America</HI> by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and their be∣coming
at first possessors of any places there,
nor at any time since, was the Soveraignty
and Dominion of the whole <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien</HI>
vested in any one Person whatsoever, as the
sole and alone Ruler, Governor and Prince of
it. But it anciently was, and has always hi∣therto
been divided and distributed into seve∣ral
little Principalities and Jurisdictions, over
which they who bear the supreme Sway, and
give Laws unto the rest of the Natives in their
different and respective Precincts, and both had,
and still have, Obedience paid and yielded un∣to
them, by those that were or are the <HI>Indigenae</HI>
or Natural Inhabitants, deserv'd rather the
Name and Stile of <HI>Captains</HI> than the Title of Prin∣ces
and Kings. And who, tho' they be accor∣dingly
call'd by the Natives <HI>Caciques,</HI> which is
a much lower appellation than those of <HI>Ingas,</HI>
and the being the <HI>Off-spring</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> by
which <HI>Emperors</HI> of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Mexico</HI> were
stil'd; yet they have been at all times both <HI>ab∣solute</HI>
within their several respective Districts,


<PB N="93" REF="63"/>
and altogether <HI>independent</HI> upon, and <HI>unaccoun∣table</HI>
to one another, or to any Potentate else
whatsoever; and how contiguous soever their
Principalities may be, and tho' never so small,
narrow and contracted in their Dimensions and
Extents; yet further than as they became con∣federated
and united together by leagues be∣tween
one another against their Enemies, and
particularly for mutual defence against the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI>
whom they ever did, and still do account
their common Enemy, they have at all times
had an independent and absolute Power and
Authority within each of their own particular
Bounds, which they have unaccountably to any
other Prince, Sovereign or Monarch whatso∣ever,
exercised over such as did inhabit in their
several distinct Circuits.</P>
<P>Nor is this a thing singular and peculiar
to the People on the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> but
what hath been and still is common upon the
<HI>Continents</HI> and in the Isles of <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africk</HI> as
well as in many other Countries, Provinces
and Islands of <HI>America,</HI> besides that which I have
been speaking of. Nor can any Person that
pretends to have been conversant in <HI>Geography</HI>
or <HI>Histories</HI> be ignorant of this matter, where∣of
all the Accounts and Narratives which we
have of those three parts of the World do
so fully and particularly instruct us. Neither
ought we to think it strange, that this should
be the form, model, and manner of Govern∣ment
on the foresaid <HI>Isthmus,</HI> and that the
boundaries of supreme Authority and Jurisdi∣ction
there, should be so narrowly limited,
confin'd and circumscrib'd, if we do but allow
our selves to observe, how that there is the


<PB N="94" REF="64"/>
same Species of Rule and Domination both as to
quality and extent, to be every where found and
met with, in <HI>Brasile, Chili, Paragua, Florida, Caro∣lina,
Virginia, Malabar,</HI> and the Country which
is call'd <HI>The Land of the</HI> Amazons, of which
it is particularly remarkable, that there are a∣bove
<HI>Fifty</HI> different <HI>Indian</HI> Nations, or distinct
and independant <HI>Septs,</HI> on the banks of the Ri∣ver
that is so call'd.</P>
<P>Nor was the like heretofore altogether un∣usual
and unexemplify'd in the <HI>European</HI> parts
of the World, whereof the several and distinct
supreme Principalities of the ancient <HI>Britains</HI>
in <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Caesar de Bell. Gall. <HI>lib. 5. and</HI> Camb∣den'<HI>s Brit, in</HI> Cant.</NOTE> where in <HI>Julius Caesar</HI>'s time, there
were no fewer than four distinct Kings in <HI>Kent</HI>
alone, namely, <HI>Cingetorix, Carvilius, Taxima∣gulus,</HI>
and <HI>Segonax;</HI> or, as <HI>Cambden</HI> calls them
<HI>Reguli vel melioris Notae Nobiles; Captains</HI> or
Persons distinguish'd from the <HI>Vulgar</HI> by their
Power and Figure, and whose Territories could
not be much larger, if of that extent, as the
<HI>Districts</HI> of the several <HI>Caciques</HI> on the <HI>Isthmus</HI>
of <HI>Darien</HI> are. And the like may be said, on∣ly
allowing them greater dimensions of Terri∣tory,
of the <HI>Saxons</HI> during the <HI>Heptarchy</HI> after∣wards
in the same Country, as well as of the <HI>Scots</HI>
and <HI>Picts</HI> in the ancient <HI>Caledonia.</HI> Yea, and the
distinct and different Soveraignties which were
in <HI>Spain</HI> it self, not only both before and after
it was a Roman Province, but even until less
than within these two last Centuries, As <HI>Le∣on,
Arragon, Navarre, Castile</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> un∣der
which the Christians in <HI>Spain</HI> were divided
and those of <HI>Cordova, Sivil, Malaga, Granada,</HI>
and others under the power of the <HI>Moors,</HI> not
to speak of the several independent and absolute


<PB N="95" REF="64"/>
Jurisdictions, which are at this day both in <HI>Italy</HI>
and some other places, do abundantly confirm the
same. And were not the <HI>Bible</HI> a <HI>Book,</HI> that some
men are little conversant in, they would not think
it a <HI>Banter,</HI> to have those stiled Independent, Ab∣solute
and Soveraign Rulers, whose Territories
are circumscribed and confined within strait and
narrow limits. Seeing besides many Instances of
that kind, which are to be met with in divers pla∣ces
of the Sacred History, they would find that
<HI>Joshua</HI> subdued no fewer than 31 <HI>Kings</HI> in <HI>Canaan</HI>
when he conquered the Land in order to settle
the People of <HI>Israel</HI> in it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jos. 12.</NOTE> tho' that Country was
not much larger in the whole extent and cir∣cumference
of it, than some single Counties of
<HI>England</HI> are; not to add that as there were seve∣ral
Kings more, whom he did neither drive
out, nor destroy, so most of the primitive Go∣vernments
of the World were of that sort,
constitution and complexion.</P>
<P>But to what hath been already said and repre∣sented
under this head, there is further to be ad∣ded,
that whatsoever <HI>Possessions,</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have
obtained in that <HI>American Strait</HI> whether thro'
their having conquered any of the <HI>Caciques,</HI> that
had their Jurisdictions there, or by their ha∣ving
contracted Alliances, with those <HI>Indian
Governours,</HI> and by Agreements with them and
the Natives acquired a Liberty to sit down,
plant, and to erect <HI>Colonies</HI> within the limits
and bounds of their little Territories and Prin∣cipalities;
or how much soever they may have
encroached upon any of these <HI>Captains</HI> whom
they have not wholly subdued, and wrested
part of their Lands and Jurisdictions from them;
yet there are still divers of these <HI>Caciques</HI> o∣ver


<PB N="96" REF="65"/>
the Native <HI>Indians,</HI> who as neither <HI>they,
their</HI> People, nor their Territories, were ever
conquer'd by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> so they never en∣ter'd
into Agreements and Contracts with
them, nor have at any time granted liberty un∣to
them, to settle within the Precincts of
their Lands, Inheritances, and Demesnes, but
have at all times been in terms of Variance
and Hostility with them, and for the most part
in a state and condition of actual War. So that
at least within the Boundaries and Jurisdictions
of such <HI>Indian Governors,</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have no
just or legal pretence of Property and Domi∣nion.</P>
<P>For how weak and mean soever those Na∣tives
and their Rulers may be esteemed and re∣presented,
yet that doth no ways alter the case,
or any ways enfeeble their right unto, and their
authority over their own Principalities; but
they do retain an equal Claim and Title unto,
and Property in what was anciently and ori∣ginally
theirs, and what they have defended
from the Invasion and Usurpation of the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI>
as if their Dominions were as large,
and their Might and Power as great as those
of His <HI>Britannick Majesty</HI>'s are. The little <HI>Re∣public</HI>
of <HI>Geneva</HI> hath as good right in Law to
a Propriety in what they have immemorially
possess'd, as the Great <HI>Monarch</HI> of <HI>France</HI> hath un∣to
the vast and powerful Dominions over which
he is Hereditarily King and Soveraign. Yea,
they of <HI>San Marino</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI> are no less absolute
and independent Proprietors and Governors

in reference to those Things, Matters and Ends
for which they became United and Confedera∣ted.
Nor is the Duke of <HI>Mirandola,</HI> whose
<HI>Territories</HI> do not extend themselves to three
Italian Miles, less absolute and independent
over his own small Principality, than the Em∣peror
of <HI>Germany</HI> is with respect of his <HI>Austrian</HI>
and Hereditary Countries. For according to
the Laws of Nature and of Nations the point
of Right and Property is the same in the Poor
that it is in the Rich, and in the Weak that
it is in the Strong. And how impotent and
contemptible soever those unsubdu'd <HI>Caciques</HI>
on the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien</HI> are, in comparison of
His <HI>Catholick Majesty;</HI> yet it is enough to ju∣stifie
their Propriety and Authority in and o∣ver
what they possess, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have
not by all their Power and Might been hi∣therto
able to disseize, subdue, or drive them
out; but that all along since the <HI>Castilians</HI> first
descended upon the <HI>Isthmus,</HI> and occupy'd se∣veral
places within that <HI>Streight</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> they
have been in a condition, either singly by the
forces of some one or other of them alone, or
conjunctively by uniting and joyning their se∣veral
and respective Powers together, to co∣ver,
protect and defend themselves, their Ter∣ritories
and Jurisdictions from being so Invaded
as to be over-run and subdued.</P>
<P>Nor is the extent and dimensions of the
Land and Territory so scanty and small, or
the number of those <HI>Captains</HI> or their People
so few, in which, and over whom the <HI>Span<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ards</HI>
have not hitherto been able to obtain
Possession and Authority, as some who do not
give themselves leave to think so closely of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>


<PB N="98" REF="66"/>
Affair, and to examine it with that accuracy
which they ought to do, may be inclined and
ready to imagine; seeing, that upon the whole
North-side of the <HI>Isthmus</HI> from the <HI>River Da∣rien</HI>
to the <HI>Bastimentos,</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are not in
possession of one foot of Ground, nor ever
were, save for a little while at first of <HI>Nom∣bre
de Dios,</HI> which they soon relinquish'd. And
it is against both all the Topicks of Argu∣mentation,
and all the Measures of Law and
Justice, that from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having made
some Settlements on the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> and their
having, so far as they have obtain'd possession
there, restricted and confin'd the Natives to
narrow bounds, to infer and conclude from
thence, their having a Propriety in, and a Ju∣risdiction
over all the <HI>Northern Coast.</HI> And
such a pretence is the more unreasonable and
absurd, in that the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien</HI> is natu∣rally
divided by a <HI>ridge</HI> of <HI>Hills</HI> that runneth
from <HI>East</HI> to <HI>West.</HI> Nor can any allegation
whatsoever more avowedly offer violence to
common Sence, and more notoriously attempt
the putting an Affront upon the Understan∣dings
of Men, than from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> being
possessed of, and having dominion over <HI>one part</HI>
of <HI>Isthmus,</HI> to deduce and conclude from thence,
that therefore they must have a Propriety in,
and a Soveraign Jurisdiction over the <HI>whole:</HI>
And from their Title and Right of <HI>Prescription</HI>
upon long Occupation, unto some of the <HI>Sou∣thern
Boundaries</HI> of that <HI>Streight,</HI> to infer and
plead their having in the vertue of that, a Ti∣tle
to the Northern parts thereof, of which as
they were never in possession: so the People
of the <HI>latter</HI> are wholly independent upon them


<PB N="99" REF="66"/>
of the <HI>former,</HI> and the Rulers of the <HI>one</HI> alto∣gether
Absolute within themselves, without
deriving the least Authority from, or paying
any kind or degree of Subjection and Obedience
unto the <HI>other.</HI></P>
<P>And for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to pretend, that thro'
their possessing <HI>Porto Bello</HI> on the South of <HI>Da∣rien,</HI>
and <HI>Carthagena</HI> in a small Island on the
<HI>North-side</HI> of it, that therefore, and by conse∣quence,
they ought to be acknowledg'd to have
a right of Propriety in, and of Jurisdiction over
all the adjacent Country, which is between two
and three hundred English Miles in Dimension
and Extent, is not to <HI>Argue,</HI> but to <HI>Banter,</HI> and
to Ridicule and Lampoon Mankind, instead of
endeavouring to instruct, satisfie and convince
them. Especially seeing that as all the <HI>Settle∣ments</HI>
and <HI>Plantations</HI> which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have
upon, or near unto that <HI>Isthmus,</HI> whether up∣on
the <HI>Southern,</HI> or the <HI>Northern Oceans,</HI> were
all obtain'd without the <HI>consent</HI> of the <HI>Natives,</HI>
so the <HI>Indians</HI> who live and inhabit in the in∣terjacent
and intervening Countries, between
the Spaniards Plantations, on the <HI>South</HI> and
<HI>North-Seas,</HI> have still preserved the possession of
those Territories, without the having ever be∣come
subject unto, or the having any ways ac∣knowledg'd
the Soveraignty and Dominion
of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> over them. And should we
submit to that Way and Method of Reaso∣ning,
what a Claim would the Kings of <HI>France</HI>
have had long ago, to all the Countries, Pro∣vinces,
and Dominions, which the <HI>Catholick</HI>
King doth possess and bear Soveraignty over
in <HI>Europe;</HI> in that all the Spanish Provinces are
situated and do lie between the Countries which


<PB N="100" REF="67"/>
the <HI>French</HI> King possesseth upon the <HI>Ocean,</HI> and
those which he hath right unto, and Soveraigni∣ty
over on the <HI>Mediterranean.</HI> Nor can any
thing carry more intrinsic and self-evidence a∣long
with it, than that when a People were
not the first Occupiers, and the original In∣habitants,
their Title unto, and their Tenure
and Property in that case in a Country can ex∣tend
and reach no farther, than as they are
got into possession of it, either by the consent
of the Natives, or by conquest in a lawful War,
or by Prescription, thro' long Occupation, up∣on
an unjust one. None of all which do in any
manner obtain or hold, or can any ways be
pleaded by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in reference to the Pe∣ninsula
on the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> where the <HI>Scots</HI>
are settling and establishing a <HI>Colony.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, to all that is already said under
this Head, let me further subjoin, that no Na∣tions
being meerly in actual possession of part of
a Country that had not been originally their
own, hath been accounted sufficient in Equity,
Law or Justice, to preclude and debar others
from seeking to settle themselves in such pla∣ces
as those Strangers who had come first to
plant there were not in actual possession of;
whereof it were easie to assign many Instances,
but it being a matter whereof none that are
acquainted with Books of Voyages, and Na∣vigations,
can be ignorant, I shall content my
self with the mentioning of a few; but in the
mean time shall be careful, that they may be
adapted to the case that is under present de∣bate.
Let it then be observ'd in the first place,
That notwithstanding the <HI>English</HI> had planted
upon the <HI>Continent,</HI> as well as in several <HI>Islands</HI>


<PB N="101" REF="67"/>
of <HI>America,</HI> and did particularly possess upon
the <HI>Terra firma</HI> from <HI>New-England</HI> to <HI>Carolina,</HI>
without the interposition of Colonies belonging
to any <HI>European</HI> Princes or States whatsoever,
nevertheless the <HI>Dutch</HI> finding <HI>Long-Island,</HI>
that is since come to be call'd <HI>New-York,</HI> and
which lyeth within the foremention'd Limits
unoccupy'd, yet environ'd and surrounded on
all hands by English Plantations, they did in a
time of full and entire Peace betwixt the Crown
of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and the <HI>Belgick-States,</HI> sit down
and establish a Plantation upon it; which with∣out
any disturbance from the English, or their
quarrelling with them upon that account, they
continu'd to possess until the Year 1667, when
after a Treaty of Peace between King <HI>Charles</HI> II.
and the <HI>States General,</HI> for the putting an end
to that War, which had commenc'd between
those two Ruling Powers, <HI>Anno 1665, Long-Island</HI>
was exchang'd by the <HI>Dutch</HI> for <HI>Suri∣nam.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover whereas the <HI>Spanish Plate Fleet</HI> must
of necessity pass between <HI>Florida,</HI> and the <HI>Baha∣ma
Islands,</HI> unto both which the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
do likewise lay claim by challenging a property in
and a dominion over them; yet notwithstaning
of this, the <HI>English</HI> possessed themselves of the
said <HI>Islands,</HI> and tho' the <HI>Spaniards</HI> both com∣plained
and did highly resent it, and so far as
they had strength and power, did as well Bar∣barously
as Injuriously treat those <HI>English,</HI> whom
they found settled there; nevertheless the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> being no ways able to Justifie their
Right and Title to those <HI>Islands,</HI> the <HI>English</HI>
continued to assert and maintain the Possession,
which they had acquired, as long as they


<PB N="102" REF="68"/>
themselves found there Intrest in it, and
thought it convenient so to do.</P>
<P>Yea notwithstanding that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> plead
a right unto, and a propriety in <HI>Jucatan,</HI> and
if the having over-run a great part of a Coun∣try,
which is above 300 Leagues in compass,
and the having Massacred a prodigious Num∣ber
of the Native <HI>Indians,</HI> give them a legal
<HI>Title</HI> unto, and a Dominion over all the Ter∣ritories
and Districts of it, It must be acknow∣ledged
that they had them. Nevertheless, the
<HI>English</HI> have not only Sailed frequently thither,
and Landed without asking leave of the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI>
but they did appropriate unto them∣selves
the <HI>Logwood</HI> in <HI>Cape Cato,</HI> which belong∣eth
thereunto, until it was so exhausted, that
it could no longer answer the Charge of sen∣ding
Ships thither. Yea King <HI>Charles</HI> the Se∣cond
in time of Peace granted a patent to
Dr. <HI>Cox</HI> to settle in the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Mexico,</HI> which
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> never questioned, nor complai∣ned
of. And that the Doctors project did not
succeed, proceeded from the inability or the
backwardness of the Undertakers to carry it on,
and not from the Illegality or Invalidity of
that Princes Patent to have Authorized and
Justified it.</P>
<P>Further tho' the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Campechay,</HI> which
lies in the <HI>Gulph</HI> of <HI>Mexico,</HI> must be confessed
to be Situate in a Country, over which the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> pretend to have the sole Soveraign∣ty
and Jurisdiction, yet the <HI>English</HI> have ac∣counted
this to be no Obstruction in way of
Law and Justice, to their settling at <HI>Port Roy∣al</HI>
in the said <HI>Bay,</HI> and their carrying on there
the same Trade, of cutting and providing them∣selves


<PB N="103" REF="68"/>
of <HI>Logwood,</HI> which they formerly did at
<HI>Cape Cato.</HI> Whereof as I never heard of any
complaint made by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> So we may
believe that it would not have been regarded
if there had, but that the <HI>English</HI> would have
pursued and persevered in the same Course and
Method, of settling, removing, and resettling
there again, all which they did as they thought
convenient, and for their Advantage.</P>
<P>Moreover tho' all men know, that the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
have not only many great Plantations
and Colonies in <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> but challenge a Pe∣culiar
right to that Country, as having conquered
it, or rather got Treacherously, Violently and
Barbarously, into the possession of it, and where∣of
their Massacring some Millions of the Na∣tives,
may be admitted as a crying and exe∣crable,
as well as a sufficient and undeniable
Proof; yet the <HI>French</HI> upon their finding <HI>Pettit
Guaves,</HI> which lieth and is Situated in <HI>Hispa∣niola,</HI>
Unoccupied and Unpossessed, they have
without paying any respect to the pretensions
of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> taken the liberty to settle
there, and to establish a Colony, and to culti∣vate
a Trade. And likewise notwithstanding
the claim of an Universal Right and Jurisdicti∣on,
which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> (as I have often said)
do challenge unto, and over the whole Empire
of <HI>Mexico,</HI> yet the <HI>French</HI> have not only once
and again endeavoured to settle upon the River
<HI>de Spiritu Sancto,</HI> which is in the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Mexi∣co,</HI>
and are at this time studying how to settle
at the disemboging of the River <HI>Messisipi</HI>
which is in the <HI>Gulph</HI> of <HI>Mexico,</HI> but they have
actually settled in <HI>Guiana,</HI> that is Situated
upon the <HI>Terra firma</HI> of the <HI>Mexican</HI> Con∣tinent.</P>
<P>

<PB N="104" REF="69"/>
Yea moreover still, namely that tho' the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> have great Possessions and many Plan∣tations,
on the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien</HI> towards the
<HI>South-Sea,</HI> and do pretend a right of Domini∣on
and Soveraignty over that whole Country,
yet the <HI>French</HI> have been endeavouring to set∣tle
on the <HI>Sambolas</HI> Islands, which lie much
nearer to <HI>Porto bello,</HI> and other <HI>Spanish</HI> Plantati∣ons
on that <HI>Isthmus,</HI> towards the <HI>Northern</HI> Sea
than Port <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>la</HI> doth, where the <HI>Scots</HI> have be∣gun
to Fix and Establish a <HI>Colony;</HI> in order
whereunto, they do greatly caress and court
a certain Indian Cacique, called Captain <HI>Corbe∣lo,</HI>
whose Territories lie from the <HI>Sambola's</HI> to
that River of <HI>Conception,</HI> as hoping by his Fa∣vour
and Assistance to succeed and prosper
in their design; nor are they wanting in their
addresses to Captain <HI>Ambrosio,</HI> whose Jurisdicti∣on
extends from the River <HI>Pinas</HI> to the <HI>Sambo∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI>
and we may be sure upon the same prospect,
if not also <HI>on the design of setling within the</HI> Isth∣mus
<HI>it self,</HI> whose Friendship they have in a
great measure acquired, partly by means of his
mortal enmity to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and partly
by the intercession of a Brother in Law of his
called <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> who having been taken by
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and kept for some time by them
at <HI>Panama</HI> as a Slave, doth therefore irrecon∣cilably
hate them.</P>
<P>Whereunto indeed much more might be ad∣ded,
and largely insisted upon in reference to
such Countries Islands and Districts, which the
<HI>French</HI> are become possessed of in those parts
of <HI>America</HI> where the <HI>Spaniards</HI> pretend to have
a Soveraignity and Jurisdiction exclusive of all
other <HI>European</HI> Nations, but that it is wholly


<PB N="105" REF="69"/>
needless, and would be accounted to be done
in design to weary the reader, rather than to
inform and convince him, and which would
also be an encreasing this discourse into a length
and bulk beyond what the question in debate
doth any wise require, tho' it be both very
important in it self, and the desires and expecta∣tion
of men at this time more than ordinarily
excited and raised, for the having it fully cleared
and decided. And therefore all that I will
add further, concerning the rest of the <HI>Planta∣tions</HI>
which the <HI>French</HI> have in those <HI>American
Territories</HI> and places, where the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do
alledge their obtaining a peculiar property,
and right of Dominion▪ shall be barely to men∣tion
them. Namely that they have not only
Colonies in <HI>Martinigo,</HI> St. <HI>Christopher's, Guardu∣lupa,</HI>
and divers of the <HI>Charibbes</HI> as well as other
<HI>Islands,</HI> to the number at least of <HI>twelve</HI> or <HI>thir∣teen,</HI>
and all these within the Limits and Boun∣daries
unto, and over which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do
claim a Right preclusive of all others; but
that they also have and do possess several Forts
on the Coast of <HI>Caribana,</HI> that lyeth in the ve∣ry
Heart and Bosom of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and which is
not many Leagues distant from the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of
<HI>Darien,</HI> or may be rather said to joyn up∣on
it.</P>
<P>And upon the some Motive of my designing
to be short, and not to load and cloy the Rea∣der
with more Examples and Instances of the
foregoing nature, than are either indispensibly
necessary, or which at least may be such, as
they who are impartial Inquirers into the <HI>legality</HI>
of the <HI>Fact</HI> of the <HI>Scots</HI> Indian and African
Company, will not be displeased to be made


<PB N="106" REF="70"/>
acquainted with. I say that I shall therefore
upon that inducement, only briefly intimate
what <HI>Colonies</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> have settled and esta∣blish'd
within those American Territories, un∣to
which (besides the Title that the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
pretend to the whole Continent and all the
Islands of <HI>America</HI> on the Foot of the <HI>Pop</HI>'s
<HI>Bull</HI> which hath been already disprov'd and ma∣nifested
to be vain and ridiculous) they plead
a particular Right, either thro' their having
been parts of the Empires, Kingdoms, and
Countries, of which they became possessed, or
else that they had been some way or another,
dependent upon, or tributary unto them. For
the <HI>Dutch</HI> knowing all these Pretensions and
Claims of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to be groundless, vain,
and ridiculous, and accordingly slighting and
despising them, are not only settled in <HI>Surinam,</HI>
and have several Forces on the Coasts of <HI>Guay∣ane,</HI>
and are Masters of the City <HI>Coro,</HI> which
are all upon the <HI>Terra firma,</HI> but they have
likewise possess'd themselves both of the Island
<HI>Curasoa,</HI> that lies not above seven Leagues from
the Main, near unto <HI>Cape Roman,</HI> and of the Islands
<HI>Araba</HI> and <HI>Bonary</HI> which are not far distant from
that, and had also planted in the Island <HI>Tabago</HI>
until driven thence by the <HI>French, Anno 1677;</HI>
during the time of that War which commenc'd
1672, between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>By all which many and various Instances of
divers <HI>European</HI> Nations settling within those
Provinces, Islands, and Places of <HI>America,</HI> which
they found unoccupy'd by any other <HI>European</HI>
Princes or States, and whereof several more ex∣amples
might be assign'd (but that it is need∣less
and would be superfluous) of other Poten∣tates


<PB N="107" REF="70"/>
and Republics in <HI>Europe</HI> that have done the
like, notwithstanding any Claim of Property,
Right and Title which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> pretend to
have in, and unto them, and which they have
with great confidence heretofore asserted, tho'
without any foundation either in Reason or
Law. I say, that I hope it will indisputably
appear by these Instances and Examples, that
what the <HI>Scots</HI> have lately done in the esta∣blishing
a <HI>Colony</HI> with the consent of the Na∣tives
at <HI>Acla</HI> on the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> which
was a place never possess'd nor occupy'd by the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> is, according to the same measures
of Equity and Justice, undeniably lawful, and
demonstratively justifiable; and that all who are
impartial and unprejudic'd will acknowledge it
to be so.</P>
<P>And whatsoever hath been said in defence
and justification of any <HI>European</HI> Nation's ha∣ving
a right to settle in such parts of <HI>America</HI>
as were never occupy'd and possess'd by the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> it is of equal validity and force to
authorize and warrant the sitting down and
planting in any place, or places there, that may
heretofore have been possessed by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
but which they have since voluntarily relin∣quish'd;
as they are known to have done in
the abandoning several places both on the Con∣tinent
and in the Islands of <HI>America,</HI> where
they had formerly settled and establish'd <HI>Colo∣nies,</HI>
as well as in their forsaking <HI>Nombre de
Dios,</HI> and a <HI>Plantation</HI> which they once had on
the <HI>River Darien,</HI> which they left and with∣drew
from; after that they became possessed
of <HI>Porto Bello</HI> and <HI>Carthagena.</HI> For tho' it hath
been always acknowledg'd, as being grounded


<PB N="108" REF="71"/>
upon the Laws of Nature and Nations, that
they who are the original, lawful and uncon∣troverted
Possessors of a Country or Land, and
have been once in the occupation of it by <HI>acts</HI>
of the <HI>Body,</HI> may and do retain a Right and
Title unto it by <HI>acts</HI> of the <HI>Mind,</HI> after their
having Corporally forsaken and left it; yet it
is far otherwise with respect to a People who
are come into a Country, not only as <HI>Aliens</HI>
and <HI>Strangers,</HI> but as <HI>Invaders</HI> and <HI>Vsurpers,</HI>
which is the case of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in relation
to those places on the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> as
well as elsewhere in <HI>America</HI> where they had
at any time heretofore set down and planted,
but have since departed and withdrawn. For
being neither the primitive Inhabitants, nor
having settled there with the leave and con∣sent
of the Natives, they can stand no other∣wise
entit'led to any right in, and over those
places, than as they have the actual possession,
and are Occupiers in <HI>Fact.</HI> Seeing as their
forceable and violent entrance into, and their
sitting down in them, by, and in the meer
vertue of Power and Strength, neither did, nor
could defeat and extinguish the right of those
that had been the <HI>Indigenae</HI> and original Inha∣bitants;
so immediately upon their withdraw∣ing
from, and their relinquishing of those pla∣ces,
the <HI>Title</HI> of the <HI>Natives</HI> unto them doth
revive and take place, and becomes again as
effectual, both for the justifying their own Re∣assumption,
and Re-occupation of them, and
for their granting a liberty, freedom and right,
to any other Foreigners to settle in those pla∣ces,
as shall come among them, and desire it,
as if they had never been at any time, either


<PB N="109" REF="71"/>
disseized or driven from, or disquieted, in∣terrupted
and rendred unsafe in their occupa∣tion
of them.</P>
<P>And how easy were it to multiply Exam∣ples
and Instances even in <HI>Europe,</HI> where they
of one Nation having by Violence, obtained
Possession of some of the Cities, Towns, Lands
and Territories of another, so as either direct∣ly
to expel and drive away those, who had been
the Rightful Inhabitants and Proprietors, or
to beget that fear in them, as to cause them
to chuse of themselves, either to depart and
fly from their Possessions, in order to escape
the rage of those that had invaded them, than
by continuing in their legal inheritances, to be∣come
exposed to the Lustful Pleasure, and cru∣elty
of their Enemies; Yet no man ever thought,
that the Title of such, who upon the forego∣ing
Motive, had abandoned, or who in the
forementioned manner, had been thrust out
and forced away, became thereby Annulled
and Extinguished. But all do confess, and the
practice hath been every where, and at all
times accordingly, that upon the withdraw∣ment,
and departure of them who had been
the Invaders and Usurpers, the other might
in the virtue of their Antecedent and Anci∣ent
Title, reasume the possession of what they
had been either driven from, or had aban∣doned.</P>
<P>But not to trouble my Readers with <HI>Me∣moirs</HI>
of that Nature, relating to <HI>Europe,</HI> I shall
at once evidence and confirm what I have said
by two Instances, whereof the First shall be
in reference to a <HI>Country,</HI> upon the <HI>conti∣nent</HI>
of <HI>America,</HI> that was once in the Posses∣sion


<PB N="110" REF="72"/>
of another <HI>European</HI> Power, than that of
<HI>Spain,</HI> and the Second shall be concerning a
<HI>noted Island</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> that was here∣tofore
possessed by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> but both
which are now in the rightful occupation of
the <HI>English.</HI> The former in brief is this; Name∣ly,
that the <HI>French</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI>
the Ninth and by his Authority, as well as by his
encouragement, having in the Year 1569;
Transported 1200 Families together with 300
Soldiers, to the Northern part of <HI>Florida,</HI> and
having there established a <HI>Colony,</HI> between 32
and 33 degrees N. Lat. which after that Kings
name they stiled <HI>Carolina,</HI> but who upon their
treating the Natives injuriously, and thro'
their having settled at places so remote and
distant from one another, that the dispersed
and scattred Planters, could neither give nor re∣ceive
mutual Relief nor Support, were in the
Year 1573, assaulted and all cut off by the <HI>In∣dians,</HI>
save one Monsieur <HI>Chaplain,</HI> and about
35 more, who got timely into a small Ship that
lay close by a Fort, and therein escaped to
the <HI>Island Anticosty,</HI> in the mouth of the Ri∣ver
<HI>Canada,</HI> yet that notwithstanding of the
settlement there of the <HI>French,</HI> and their ha∣ving
been once possessed of that place, the
<HI>English</HI> are now gotten into Possession of it,
and have erected there a Noble and Flourish∣ing
<HI>Colony,</HI> the propriety whereof, was in the
Year 1661 granted by <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, King
of <HI>England,</HI> to several men of Quality and
their Associates, and whereof the <HI>French</HI> have ne∣ver
complained as of a wrong and Injustice done
unto them. And indeed they are a wiser People,
than to be guilty of so great an Absurdity,


<PB N="111" REF="72"/>
and they do very well know, that such a
Complaint would by the <HI>English</HI> have been
counted ridiculous, in that thro' their having
been the first <HI>Europeans</HI> that settled there, but
expelled thence by the Natives, on whom they
had intruded, there neither doth arise nor re∣main
unto them any Right of claim unto that
Country, nor any exception against the Title
of the <HI>English</HI> thereunto, who are become pos∣sest
thereof with the liking and consent of the
Natives.</P>
<P>The Second is that of <HI>Barbados,</HI> which the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI>
having for some time settled upon, left and
forsook, in order to their planting in other places
in that <HI>Hemisphere,</HI> which they hoped would turn
to better account, and prove more to their Ad∣vantage;
as they did upon the like motive
abandon many other places, where they had
at first Sit down, which <HI>Island</HI> the <HI>English</HI> ha∣ving
found Unoccupied, either by them, or any
other <HI>Europeans,</HI> and nothing left upon it, that
could denominate the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to be Residen∣tial,
or entitle them to the possession and pro∣priety
of it, save a few <HI>Hogs,</HI> that were ne¦ver
by any Laws whatsoever, reckoned proper
and valuable Representatives, Substitutes and
Deputies, for the keeping possession in the
name and behalf of a people; the <HI>English</HI>
thereupon entred into the <HI>Island,</HI> and made
settlements there, which how displeasing and
offensive soever it was to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> at first,
and how ready soever they were to have Quar∣relled
with their <HI>Successors</HI> upon that head,
had their Power been answerable to their Re∣sentment;
Yet they have by a solemn <HI>Treaty</HI>
since, renounced all pretensions of Claim and


<PB N="112" REF="73"/>
Title unto it, and have acknowleged the <HI>En∣glish</HI>
to be the Lawful Rightful Proprietors of
<HI>Barbados.</HI> But I will insist no longer, nor add
any more on this head, all that hath been al∣ready
said upon it, having been done <HI>ex Abun∣danti,</HI>
in order meerly to render this discourse,
as particular and clear as I can; not that it
was absolutely and indispensably needful to∣wards
the Justification, of the <HI>Scots Calidonian
Colony,</HI> seeing that place was never in the
possession of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> But hath always
continued in the possession of the <HI>Natives.</HI></P>
<P>The point then that is next to be more
narrowly enquired into, and to be discoursed
with greater application, than it hath hither∣to
been, is to search out, assign and shew the
strength of the reasons, upon which the <HI>Scots</HI>
sitting down erecting Forts, and planting a
Colony, in the place above-mentioned is foun∣ded
and done. And I shall endeavour to give
that detale, and to make such an enumerati∣on
and deduction of them, as shall convince
the unbiassed part of Mankind, that it is both
Lawfully and Legally done by <HI>them,</HI> and with∣out
wrong, Injury or Injustice to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI>
It is true that I might supersede the giving
my self this trouble, in that thro' the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI>
charging the <HI>Scots,</HI> to have therein Inva∣ded
their Territories and Demesus; and the
<HI>Scots</HI> positively denying it, the proof of the
Charge and Accusation should be wholly de∣volved
upon the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> for that being the
affirmative part of the Controversy and Que∣stion,
which is that alone in any matter of de∣bate,
which is accounted capable of admitting
probation, it belongs therefore unto them to


<PB N="113" REF="73"/>
make it good: Whereas the <HI>Scots</HI> by insisting
and standing altogether upon that which is
the <HI>Negative</HI> part, are both by all the <HI>Logical
Rules</HI> of Argumentation, and by all the Me∣thods,
Measures and Standards, allowed as well
as required in <HI>judicial</HI> Proceedings, excused
from proving of their Right any otherwise, than
by answering the Allegations and Exceptions
which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do advance against it: For
the <HI>Company</HI> denying that ever the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
had any possession of the place where they have
planted, or the least legal Right unto, or
Property in it; and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> alledging that
they had, it doth in Law and Reason, belong
unto the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to instruct and prove what
they pretend unto, and challenge. Nevertheless,
for the obviating of all Clamours, and extin∣guishing
of all Suspicions against, and in refe∣rence
to the Legality, Equity, and Justice of
what the <HI>Scots</HI> have done, I shall put this Mat∣ter
into such a shape and mould, as that the
probation of it may be devolv'd and made in∣cumbent
upon the <HI>Scots,</HI> and the proofs there∣of
expected from them. That which I do
therefore say and affirm, is, That the <HI>Scots</HI> are
become rightful Proprietors of that part of the
<HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien</HI> where they are <HI>Settled,</HI> and
that they have a good legitimate and legal
Title to that <HI>portion</HI> of that <HI>American Streight,</HI>
whereof they have taken possession, and are be∣come
Occupiers; and that therein they have
done no wrong to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> but that they
are upon a better, and a more just, righteous,
and legal Bottom, in reference to their <HI>Cale∣donian
Colony</HI> and Plantations, than the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI>
themselves are, either in relation to those


<PB N="114" REF="74"/>
Settlements, which they have upon that <HI>Isth∣mus,</HI>
or with respect to such <HI>Colonies</HI> which
they have in any other parts of <HI>America.</HI> And
that which I have here asserted, and with the
highest confidence adhere unto my affirmation
of, bears upon these <HI>Three</HI> following Things,
which are all of them uncontestably True, de∣monstratively
Evident, and as infallibly Certain,
according to the receiv'd Maxims of Law, by
which Titles, Rights and Properties are defi∣ned,
decided and determined, as those Princi∣ples
of Science are confessed to be, of the <HI>whole</HI>'s
being greater than a <HI>part;</HI> and that where two
<HI>Propositions</HI> are directly <HI>contradictory,</HI> the <HI>one</HI> of
them unto the <HI>other,</HI> they cannot both of them
be <HI>true.</HI></P>
<P>The first is, that the <HI>Natives</HI> were not only
originally the rightful <HI>Possessors</HI> of that place,
but that they were <HI>actually</HI> in the <HI>Possession</HI> and
<HI>Occupation</HI> of it, when the <HI>Scots</HI> landed and sat
down there. And hereof there are <HI>Five</HI> un∣deniable
proofs.</P>
<P>(1.) Their inhabiting in that <HI>part</HI> of the
<HI>Isthmus,</HI> not only independent upon the <HI>Spani∣ards,</HI>
and without their leave, but against their
will, and in defiance of their Power: Nor did
they only continue to dwell there, without the
demanding liberty of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> so to do;
but they had always debarr'd and shut out,
nor had ever receiv'd or suffer'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
to dwell amongst them. And if any thing be
sufficient to declare a People to be the right∣ful
and actual Possessors of a Country; surely
the possessing it both Hereditarily from the pri∣mitive
Occupiers and Proprietors of it, and


<PB N="115" REF="74"/>
preclusively of all others whatsoever, must be held
and esteemed enough to do it.</P>
<P>(2.) That the <HI>Native Indians</HI> were at the
time of the <HI>Scots</HI> landing, and of their begin∣ning
to settle, the lawful, actual, and sole Pos∣sessors
of that <HI>part</HI> of the <HI>Isthmus,</HI> where the
<HI>Scots</HI> have erected <HI>Forts,</HI> and built themselves
Dwellings, doth uncontrolably appear, from
their having receiv'd and welcom'd them,
without the having had any Communication
with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> about it, and in order there∣unto,
or the having ask'd liberty of them for
the doing of it: For it is not only dissonant
from the Custom and Practice of all People and
Nations whatsoever, who are either Subjects
or Tributary to others, whom they acknow∣ledge
for their Rulers and Sovereigns, to ad∣mit
and receive Aliens and Foreigners calmly
and tamely among them, without first sending
to their Superiors, and their rightful Gover∣nors,
to understand their pleasure, and to ob∣tain
their Instructions and Commands concer∣ning,
and how to behave themselves in it:
But it is likewise Treason by the Laws of all
Constitutions and Governments, and a Fact that
is capitally punishable to do otherwise. And
consequently the <HI>Indians</HI> on that part of the
<HI>Isthmus,</HI> having done nothing of all this in re∣ference
to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> but on the contrary,
having by a Right, Power and Authority in∣herently
lodg'd in themselves, receiv'd and wel∣com'd
the <HI>Scots</HI> into their Country, convers'd
with them in a friendly and peaceable manner,
given them all the hospitable Entertainment,
and kind liberal Supplies, Relief and Succour,
which their Condition and Circumstances ena∣bled


<PB N="116" REF="75"/>
them to render, is a proof beyond the be∣ing
reasonably control'd, of their being the Pro∣prietors
as well as the Possessors of those Ter∣ritories
and Districts in <HI>Darien,</HI> where the <HI>Scots</HI>
are settled.</P>
<P>(3.) There may be subjoyned hereunto, in
further confirmation that the <HI>Native Indians,</HI>
by the confession and acknowledgment even of
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> themselves, were the unquestioned
and undoubted Possessors and Occupiers of that
part of the <HI>Isthmus,</HI> where the <HI>Scots</HI> have esta∣blish'd
their Plantation and <HI>Colony,</HI> and of the
Country neighbouring upon and adjacent unto
it, in that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have at several times
<HI>treated</HI> with them, as with a <HI>free</HI> and <HI>indepen∣dent</HI>
People, and by Agreements, Contracts and
Stipulations, have, upon certain Conditions and
Terms, obtain'd and procur'd liberty of them,
to settle Colonies within their Circuits and
Precincts, and to employ People to work in
such Gold and Silver <HI>Mines,</HI> as do lie within
the Compass of their Jurisdictions. Whereof
to omit other examples, I shall assign one known
and public Instance, and I shall the rather
do it, because it respecteth the nearest possession
of <HI>Mines</HI> which have been wrought in by the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
to the place where the <HI>Scots</HI> are planted,
of any which they can pretend to have upon
the <HI>Isthmus.</HI> The instance and case then, in
brief, is this; namely, That there being with∣in
12 or 13 Leagues of the <HI>Caledonian Colo∣ny,</HI>
certain Gold and Silver <HI>Mines,</HI> which are
esteem'd as rich as are either in that or any other
<HI>parts</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> therefore, to get
into the Possession, and to reap the Benefit of
them, instead of attempting by Power and
Force, and in the way of Conquest to do it,


<PB N="117" REF="75"/>
they amicably address'd the <HI>Cacique,</HI> in whose
Territories and within whose Jurisdiction they
lay, who was call'd <HI>Captain Diego,</HI> and by a
Treaty and Stipulation with him, that he should
have a share of what Gold should be obtain'd,
procur'd leave upon that condition to enter
upon the Occupation of those <HI>Mines;</HI> which
as it is an undeniable evidence, in the Opinion
and Judgment of the very <HI>Spaniards</HI> themselves,
that <HI>Diego</HI> and his People were both the right∣ful
and legal Possessors and Proprietors of that
Territory and District; so the liberty that
was granted unto the <HI>Spaniards</HI> by that <HI>Ca∣cique,</HI>
and the People that were under him,
did no ways desseize him of, or eject him out of
his Right, nor change, and much less extinguish
his Property in that Territory where the <HI>Mines</HI>
were. They being rather admitted as Te∣nants
and Labourers who were to pay him a
Rent in allowing him such a proportion of
their gains, than as Proprietors that had a le∣gal
Right and Title in them. And according∣ly
when the same <HI>Captain Diego</HI> found that the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> had not only violated the Conditions
upon which he had given them permission to
work in those <HI>Mines,</HI> by refusing to grant him
his Tribute or Share when it was sent for and
demanded, but that they were contriving,
plotting and conspiring how to destroy and ex∣terminate,
or at least to enslave him and his People,
he thereupon forcibly fell upon them, and drove
them from thence. Which as it was done some
little time before the <HI>Scots</HI> came to settle on
the <HI>Isthmus,</HI> so at their arrival there, they found
that place, as well as all other that lay near to
the spot where they have establish'd their <HI>Colony</HI>


<PB N="118" REF="76"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Europeans</HI> and particularly altoge∣ther
Unpossessed and Unoccupied by the <HI>Spa∣niards.</HI></P>
<P>(4.) There may yet be annexed, as a further
proof of the <HI>Native Indians,</HI> being the right∣ful
owners, proprietors and possessors of that
part of the <HI>Isthmus,</HI> that they have successive∣ly
since the <HI>Castilians</HI> first discovery of that
Country, and their Landing in it, been in terms
of Hostility as well as of distance with them,
who as they were never subdued, nor brought
into that Subjection, as either Formally or Ta∣citely,
Explicitely, or Implicitely to acknow∣ledge
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> having a Dominion or So∣veraignty
over them, or to confess their being
become Subjects, or Vassals to the <HI>Spaniards;</HI>
So the hostile oppositions, which they have
in all times continued to make against them,
cannot be said to have been a <HI>Rebellious,</HI> but
<HI>Just</HI> and <HI>Lawful Wars.</HI> It being the highest of
Nonsence to stile them <HI>Rebels,</HI> who were never
<HI>Subjects.</HI> Yea it is to ridicule as well as to
endeavour to mislead, and impose upon Man∣kind,
to bestow that Title and Epithete, upon
the Martial actions against the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> of
those <HI>Darien Indians,</HI> of whom I have been
speaking; it being a perversion of Words,
from their proper and allowed Signification,
and the fastning a sence and meaning upon
them, which they were never invented, insti∣tuted,
nor agreed to bear, which is worse
than the speaking unto them in a Language
that is wholly unknown. In that by the <HI>latter</HI>
we are only left under Ignorance, of what an
other intends to say unto us; but in the way
of the <HI>former,</HI> there is a plain design to cozen


<PB N="119" REF="76"/>
and cheat us. Nor is it unworthy of remark,
that of all the <HI>Natives</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> whom the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> have for their enemies, they have none
that are more inveterately and mortally so,
than the unsubdued <HI>Indians</HI> on the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of
<HI>Darien,</HI> as doth not only appear by what they
themselves have done, and continue to do a∣gainst
them; but by the encouragement and
assistance, which they have at all times been
ready to give,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Hack</HI>'s collect. of Voyages, and the Hist. of the <HI>Bucca∣ners</HI> Vol. 2.</NOTE> unto the <HI>Privateers, Piccaroons</HI> and
<HI>Buccaneers</HI> of all Nations, that have within their
circle ever come to assault and prey upon them.
Witness what they did in the case of <HI>Captain
Sharp,</HI> who having Landed at <HI>Golden Island</HI> with
330 men, and being Joyned by two <HI>Darien
Caciques,</HI> with a good body of <HI>Indians,</HI> took
<HI>Sancta Maria,</HI> and made prize of several <HI>Spa∣nish
Ships;</HI> It being also upon the Invitation,
and with the aid of those <HI>Indian Rulers,</HI> that
Captain <HI>Sawking</HI> assaulted <HI>Panama,</HI> the Legality
and Justice whereof as founded upon the Au∣thority
of those <HI>Caciques,</HI> whose commission
he had obtained, he avowed and asserted in a
Letter to the Governor of that place.</P>
<P>(5.) There remains one thing yet further
to be added, in demonstration that the <HI>Indian
Natives</HI> are not only the True, Rightful and
Undoubted proprietors and possessors of those
<HI>Territories</HI> upon the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> of which
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are not become Masters, nor have
planted Colonies in them; but that they have
been Openly, Solemnly and Avowedly owned
and acknowledged to be such, both by the
<HI>Courts</HI> and <HI>Civil</HI> Judicatures of <HI>England.</HI> Now
the case which I have my eye upon, and do re∣fer
unto for the support of this assertion, be∣ing


<PB N="120" REF="77"/>
signally remarkable in it self, as well as
wonderfully Pertinent, Suited and Adapted to
the matter in hand, I shall therefore both give
a brief detale of it, and endeavour to set in the
true and best light that I can. The case in
short then was this; namely that the same <HI>Bar∣tholomew
Sharp,</HI> whom I have just now menti∣oned,
being an <HI>English</HI> man, and consequently a
Natural Subject of his Majesty of Great <HI>Bri∣tain,</HI>
was by a <HI>Memorial</HI> given in by the <HI>Spa∣nish</HI>
Ambassador to King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second,
complained of, for having in the time of Peace
between the two Crowns, committed <HI>Acts</HI> of
<HI>Hostility</HI> and <HI>Piracy</HI> upon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the
<HI>West-Indies,</HI> and thereby taken great Treasure
and Booty from them, of which Restitution
and Reparation was demanded. Nor was it
deniable but that the said <HI>Sharp,</HI> having Joyned
with the <HI>Dariens,</HI> who were then in War
with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as indeed they always in
effect are, did both invade the <HI>Spanish Terri∣tories,</HI>
and attack their Ships and Vessels on the
<HI>Coasts</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> and commit several acts of
Force and Hostility upon them, to their very
great Damage and Loss. For which being here
in Custody, and thereupon Indicted, Arraig∣ned
and Judicially tried, the whole he had to
plead for his Justification, as well as in his
Defence, was that he had therein Acted upon,
and in the Vertue and by the Authority of a
<HI>Commission</HI> granted unto him, by some of the
<HI>Caciques</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> who were <HI>absolute</HI> Rulers,
and altogether <HI>Independant</HI> upon the <HI>Spaniards.</HI>
Upon which <HI>Plea,</HI> after a fair and full Hearing
and Tryal, and a due consideration of their
intrinsick Power, and independant Jurisdiction


<PB N="121" REF="77"/>
and Authority, in whose name and by whose
<HI>Commission,</HI> he had made War, and committed
ravage upon the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> he was acquitted
from the criminal charge of that, whereof he
had been indicted and Arraigned, and was
declared <HI>not Guilty</HI> of the <HI>Pyracy,</HI> whereof the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> had accused him, and complained to
the King.</P>
<P>And for any to say, that the alledging of
<HI>Sharp</HI>'s having been acquitted, upon the ground
of his having acted by a <HI>Commission</HI> from the
<HI>Dariens,</HI> is a meer <HI>Jest,</HI> as some have been re∣ported
to have expressed themselves; I shall on∣ly
in reference to that <HI>Term</HI> and <HI>Phrase</HI> mo∣destly
observe, that as the matter of <HI>Fact</HI> in
his being <HI>Acquitted,</HI> is certain, and that no o∣ther
reason was then given, or hath since been
assigned of it, save his having acted by a
<HI>Commission</HI> of a People that were absolute with∣in
such and such Territories, and districts,
and altogether independant upon the <HI>Spaniards;</HI>
It is too great a reflection upon the Honour
and Justice of the Nation, the Integrity and
Uprightness of our Judicial Courts, and upon
our sincerity in the observation of Alliances,
to stile a Juridical Verdict and Sentence, a <HI>Jest,</HI> in
that which was the sole and the alone legal
Foundation of and Motive unto it. And what
an <HI>Idea</HI> would the belief of this give both <HI>Heathen</HI>
and <HI>Christian Nations</HI> of the World of us, and what
an opinion must they of all Countries, where
a regard to Truth and Justice is maintained,
conceive and entertain of the <HI>English,</HI> if in le∣gal
Trials wherein Right is to be done to
Princes in Alliance with them, Reparation to
be made unto those, who have been unjust∣ly


<PB N="122" REF="78"/>
and injuriously, as well as egregiously, wron∣ged;
and wherein Crimes of the highest Na∣ture
and of most pernicious Consequence to Man∣kind
ought to meet with their demerit; I say
that if in tryals of that kind and importance,
a sham, whim or jest, must over-rule Procee∣dings,
and be the ground of the Juridical De∣cision;
all which must be acknowledg'd to
have obtain'd in <HI>Sharp</HI>'s <HI>Acquittal,</HI> if he came
otherwise to be brought in <HI>Not Guilty,</HI> and to
be <HI>Discharged,</HI> than by reason of his having
<HI>Acted</HI> upon a Commission receiv'd from the
<HI>Dariens,</HI> as legal, supreme, and independant
Rulers over that part of the <HI>Isthmus,</HI> where they
have their Territories, and are in Possession.</P>
<P>So that having dispatch'd the <HI>first</HI> and the chief
<HI>Proposition,</HI> and the main Particular, upon which
the legitimacy of the Settlement of the <HI>Scots</HI>
Company on the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien</HI> is legally
<HI>founded;</HI> I do in the next place proceed to
the <HI>second Proposition,</HI> which I promised to lay
down, as a further ground of their having righ∣teously
become Planters, and begun the esta∣blishment
of a <HI>Colony</HI> in the place abovemen∣tion'd.
And of this I shall give an account
with more speed and ease, than I did of the for∣mer;
namely, That the true <HI>Proprietors</HI> and
lawful <HI>Possessors</HI> of a <HI>Country</HI> are <HI>vested</HI> with a
<HI>Power</HI> inherent in <HI>themselves,</HI> by which they
may rightfully and authoritatively, without being
accountable to any other, <HI>admit</HI> and <HI>receive
Strangers, Foreigners, Aliens,</HI> and others, into
their <HI>Territories,</HI> and within their own proper
and peculiar <HI>Jurisdictions,</HI> and allow them the
<HI>Freedom Privilege</HI> and <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>Settling, In∣habiting,</HI>
and <HI>Trading</HI> among them. For it is


<PB N="123" REF="78"/>
one of the first Principles both of the Laws
of Nature and Nations, that they who are
the original and primitive Proprietors, Inheri∣tors,
Possessors, and Occupyers of a <HI>Country</HI> and
<HI>Soil,</HI> may admit, welcom, and take in others,
into the Inhabiting, Planting, Cultivating, and
Improving such places and parts of it, as doth
neither thrust out and dispossess themselves of
what is either necessary or convenient to their
living safely after their wonted manner, of
Plenty and Pleasure, nor which will incommo∣date,
hurt, or endanger them in the enjoyment
of what they do retain. For tho' no Man can give,
dispose and alienate to another, that which he
neither has in possession, nor can pretend any
legal Claim of Title and Right unto, which
the <HI>Pope</HI> both betray'd his Pride and Folly in
doing, when he took upon him the granting of
all the <HI>West-Indies</HI> to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> being
therein ridiculously liberal of that which did
no ways appertain to him: Yet every one hath
a right of bestowing upon another, what is in∣disputably
his own, provided it be <HI>Sine damno
tertii,</HI> without the wronging or the prejudicing
a third Person, or a Party, upon whom he ei∣ther
depends as his Superiour, or of whose
convenience he is previously obliged, either by
the Laws of Nature or of Nations, or by ante∣cedent
Agreements, Contracts, and Stipulations,
to take care.</P>
<P><HI>Nor is this any personal or private Notion
of mine, but the uniform and universal Judg∣ment
of all</HI> Civilians, <HI>out of whose Writings
it were easie to cite many Testimonies, were
it not in a manner wholly superfluous, thro' the
intrinsic evidence which shine in the matter


<PB N="124" REF="79"/>
and case it self. So that I shall content my
self with one or two from</HI> Puffendorf, <HI>who is
one of the most Judicious and Learned, as
well as of the latest Authors that have writ∣ten
of the</HI> Right and Laws of Nature and Na∣tions,
Ea est, <HI>says he,</HI> vis Dominii, ut de rebus
quae tanquam propriae &amp; in solidum ad nos perti∣nent,
pro Arbitrio nostro disponere possimus: It is
a necessary appendent unto Dominion, that he or
they unto whom it doth properly and entirely belong,
may dispose of all and every thing or things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Jure Nat. &amp; Gent. <HI>l. 4. c.</HI> 4. §. 2. &amp; <HI>c.</HI> 6. §. 14.</NOTE> which
do fall within the compass and circle of it, to
whom, after what manner, and upon what terms
they please: <HI>And as he further saith,</HI> Vt quis
rem suam possit alienare, seu in alterum transferre,
id ipsum ex Dominii pleni natura resultat. Cum
enim hoc Domino det facultatem de re pro Arbi∣trio
disponendi, utique vel praecipua ejus facultatis
pars videtur, si ita placeat, eam in alterum posse
transferre: It belongeth as an essential property un∣to
Dominion, and followeth from the nature of it,
that he or they unto whomsoever it doth appertain, do
thereby, from thence, and thereupon stand possess'd of
and vested with a Right and Power of disposing,
transferring, and of alienating those things they have
a Right unto, and Propriety in, to what Person or Per∣sons
they shall think meet and convenient so to do.<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Jure B. &amp; P. <HI>l. 2. c.</HI> 4. §. 4.</NOTE>
<HI>To which might be added that of</HI> Grotius,
<HI>who very well saith, That</HI> Non venit ex Jure
Civili, sed ex Jure Naturali, quo quisque suum potest
abdicare: It is from the Laws of Nature, rather
than that of Nations, that every Man may dispose
of his own as he pleaseth.</P>
<P>Nor do the diversity of <HI>Forms</HI> and <HI>Modes</HI> of
Government in and over Countries and Socie∣ties
of People, any ways change and alter the


<PB N="125" REF="79"/>
case in this particular. For be the supreme
Authority placed in <HI>One</HI> Person, or in a <HI>Plura∣lity;</HI>
and be the exercise and administration of
it, either circumscrib'd or confin'd by Laws,
or left to the Arbitrary Will and Pleasure of
him that governeth, it is the same thing with
respect to that which I am discoursing of:
Seeing what the <HI>latter</HI> is enabled to do, by an
individual and <HI>despotical</HI> Right, in the execu∣tion
whereof he acts always unaccountably,
tho' possibly not at all times so wisely; the
other may do the same, under the direction of
the Laws, and with the consent of the People.
And how much soever they who are cloath'd
with the supreme ruling Power may be limi∣ted
and restrain'd, either by the Maxims of
Wisdom and Honesty, and by the Natural and
Unwritten Laws of Humanity, Gratitude and
Justice, or by Political Compacts, and Munici∣pal
Ordinances and Constitutions, from acting
against the good Welfare and Interest of their
Countries and People; yet all do acknowledge,
that both they of the one Form and Rank, and
of the other, have not only a wonderful Lati∣tude
and Liberty vouchsafed them in whatsoe∣ver
is for the advantage of themselves, and of
those over whom they are set, but that they
stand indispensably oblig'd (tho' the omission
of it is with impunity) to pursue and fall in
with every thing that is for the security and
universal Interest of themselves, their Subjects,
their Territories and Districts.</P>
<P>All which do obtain and hold in relation to
the <HI>Caciques</HI> and <HI>Native Indians</HI> on the <HI>Isthmus</HI>
of <HI>Darien,</HI> who as they have an absolute, in∣dependant
and plenary Power, to receive, give


<PB N="126" REF="80"/>
Freedom unto, and authorize such Strangers
and Foreigners, to Settle, Inhabit, and Traf∣fick
among them, as they shall think meet and
judge it convenient to entertain and endue
with those privileges; so in no one thing what∣soever
could they have more consulted their
advantage, and have acted more subserviently
to their own Interest, than in the receiving the
<HI>Scots</HI> to settle among them, and to erect Forts
and establish Colonies. For besides the Benefits
which may thereby accrue to them, whereof
they probably may be neither thoughtful nor so∣licitous,
of being render'd a more civiliz'd Peo∣ple,
and of enjoying means and helps for the
arrival at the knowledge of the true God, and
of our Lord JESUS Christ, and of all an∣nexed
thereunto, depending thereupon, and re∣sulting
from thence, There are many great
Secular advantages, which they will thereby
become furnished with, and attain unto. For
it is evident, how that by this means, the <HI>Gold</HI>
and <HI>Silver</HI> which lies hid and bury'd in their
<HI>Mines,</HI> and the several sorts of Dying Woods
which grow in their Fields, as well as many
more Natural Productions, which their Lands
do afford, besides such Goods and Commodi∣ties,
as their Grounds may, by Art and Indu∣stry,
be brought to yield and bear, will thro'
Labour and Cultivation, be gain'd and improv'd
both to their own benefit, and that of <HI>Euro∣pean</HI>
Nations, and particularly of <HI>Great Britain,</HI>
and the rest of His Majesty's Dominions, which
are all at present of little or no use, service of
advantage, either to the Natives or to the rest of
Mankind; and that partly by reason of the la∣ziness,
ignorance and unskilfulness of those


<PB N="127" REF="80"/>
<HI>Indians,</HI> and partly because of the want of a
sufficient number of fit and proper Hands, to
turn all these and more both of like and of o∣ther
kind of Productions, which that Country
either actually doth, or by Manuring may be
improv'd to afford, to a beneficialness either un∣to
themselves or unto others.</P>
<P>Moreover, by the <HI>Indians</HI> having admitted
the <HI>Scots</HI> to sit down and to establish <HI>Colonies</HI>
within their Territories, they will become
strengthened to defend themselves and their
possessions, against those who have always been
their Enemies; and who have pursued all the
ways and means, and have improved all the
advantages, which they could arrive at, either
by fraud and force, for the encroaching upon
their Demesnes, and the wresting them from
them, and for the subduing and enslaving their
Persons. For tho' the <HI>Scots</HI> are desirous to
live neighbourly, peaceably, and amicably with the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> and will be far from either commit∣ting
any acts of Hostility upon them, unless they
be first attack'd and assaulted by them (in which
case they will be justifiable by the Laws of
God and Nations to withstand and oppose force
with force) or from the countenancing, encou∣raging,
and aiding of those <HI>Natives</HI> who have
receiv'd them, and with whom they are en∣ter'd
into Alliances, in any offensive Wars a∣gainst
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> within the <HI>Spanish</HI> Colonies
and Settlements, yet the <HI>Scots</HI> will account
themselves oblig'd in Gratitude and Justice,
as well as by Vertue of the Covenants and Sti∣pulations,
which they have made and contra∣cted
with the <HI>Indians,</HI> within whose Jurisdicti∣ons,
and near unto whose Territories, there


<PB N="128" REF="81"/>
<HI>Calidonian</HI> Colony lies, to cover and protect those
<HI>Natives</HI> against all the violences, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
shall causelessly and injuriously offer them. Which
as it will be of wonderful Defence and Securi∣ty
to the Natives, amongst whom they are re∣ceived
to dwell and to trade, against their
Ancient, Constant and Irreconcilable Ene∣mies,
so it was an Act of great Discretion and
Prudence, in those <HI>Indians,</HI> that they have up∣on
the said prospect and motive, welcomed the
<HI>Scots</HI> into their Country, and admitted them
to Plant, and to erect Forts within their pre∣cincts.</P>
<P>Hereunto may be added, that it is upon the
Foundation and <HI>Basis</HI> of the <HI>Native Americans,</HI>
having an Intrinsick and Legal power of re∣ceiving
Foreigners and <HI>Aliens</HI> among them, and
an indubitable and unquestionable right of al∣lowing
them a freedom, to settle in their Coun∣tries
and within their Territories, either upon
the Continent, or in Islands, that all the Planta∣tions
of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> and particularly of the
<HI>English</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> are rendred Law∣ful
and Just in the sight of God and of
men.</P>
<P>For whereas the <HI>English</HI> were not the pri∣mitive
Inhabitants, nor the Original possessors
of those <HI>American</HI> Provinces, nor of several of the
Islands, where they have now many and large
Colonies and Plantations; they must either be
accounted violent Invaders, and unrighteous
Usurpers of those Territories where they have
settled and Planted, or they must derive their
Right and Title to their being there, from some
<HI>Act</HI> of the Natives importing their <HI>Consent</HI> to re∣ceive
them; which the <HI>Indians</HI> cannot be al∣lowed


<PB N="129" REF="81"/>
to have been capable of giving, without
a previous supposed right in them so to do.
Yea, the very <HI>Spaniards</HI> upon their first discove∣ry
of <HI>America,</HI> pretended no otherwise to set∣tle
there, than with the Allowance and Consent
of the Natives, as I have intimated before in
and from the acknowledgement of <HI>Columbus,</HI>
who was the discoverer of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> as
it is recorded by <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>errera,</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> Historian:
Tho' it must withal be confessed, that they
did not proceed upon that principle; but that
into whatsoever places they were suffered to
come, and were received by the <HI>Indians,</HI> they
did there establish themselves by Violence,
and thro' unjust Wars, and upon the En∣slaving,
Massacring and Exterminating of the
Natives.</P>
<P>There remains yet one <HI>Proposition</HI> more, which
is the <HI>third</HI> that I Promised to lay down, in
order both to the representing within a nar∣row
view and compass, the whole legal ground
and foundation, upon which the <HI>Scots</HI> settle∣ment
is Superstructed and Built, and for the de∣monstrating
that their Planting in that place of
the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> is according and agreeable
to the Laws of Nations, and consequently Lawful,
Just and Blameless, unless vitiated and rendred
Illegitimate, and Culpable thro' the Violation
of some Articles of <HI>Alliances,</HI> between the
Crowns of Great <HI>Britain</HI> and of <HI>Spain,</HI> which
I shall afterwards invincibly shew that it is
not. The proposition then, (and without
which, the two former would be of no signi∣ficancy
nor service, to the decision of the Que∣stion
under debate) is, that the <HI>Scots</HI> have
had the Leave and Consent of the <HI>Natives</HI>


<PB N="130" REF="82"/>
for their <HI>Setting down</HI> and <HI>Planting</HI> in the <HI>place</HI>
above-mention'd, and that they have neither
forcibly <HI>Invaded</HI> those <HI>Indians,</HI> nor by <HI>Fraud</HI>
or <HI>Power</HI> wrested that <HI>part</HI> of their <HI>Territory</HI>
from them; but that whatsoever they are be∣come
possess'd of, was by a <HI>Grant</HI> and <HI>Conces∣sion</HI>
of it from those <HI>Natives</HI> within whose Ju∣risdiction
it <HI>lyeth.</HI> For whereas the <HI>Scots</HI> did
not find the place <HI>void,</HI> but that it was pre∣occupy'd
by the <HI>Natives,</HI> who were the true
Proprietors of it, as well as of the Country
adjacent thereunto, it is impossible that the <HI>Scots</HI>
should have any Right and Title, for Sitting
down and erecting Forts there, unless in the
way of <HI>Conquest, Surrender,</HI> or <HI>Consent</HI> of those
who were the antecedent Inhabitants and Ow∣ners,
these being the all and the only ways
met with and known in Laws, whereby the
subsequent Comers into a Country already pos∣sess'd
and occupy'd, can acquire a Right and
Title for Sitting down and becoming Residents.
And as the <HI>Scots</HI> do wholly renounce all
pretence and claim of <HI>Conquest,</HI> as the Ground
and Foundation of their Settlement there; so
they do not challenge a Possession, either of
that particular place, where they have erected
their Works and made themselves Dwellings,
or of any part of the Country that neigh∣boureth
unto it, by and upon a plenary and
full <HI>Surrender</HI> of it to the <HI>Calidonian</HI> Company,
and exclusive of the <HI>Natives</HI> retaining any
Right in the place, save as the <HI>Scots</HI> shall ami∣cably
indulge and gratuitously allow them;
but the whole which they plead, is a <HI>Grant</HI>
from, and <HI>Consent</HI> of those <HI>Indians,</HI> who were
the primitive and rightful Proprietors, for their


<PB N="131" REF="82"/>
sitting down in that part of the Country, and
for the cultivating and improving it to their
own use and benefit, and for the taking in
such other places within their Territories as
they shall judge meet, and find themselves in
a condition to dilate, stretch and extend their
Colony unto. And the present <HI>Natives</HI> of
that place, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the Districts about it, be∣ing
as free from any subjection unto, or de∣pendance
upon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> who do at this time
possess and occupy and Colonies upon the
<HI>Isthmus,</HI> as the Ancestors and Predecessors of
the <HI>former</HI> were at any season heretofore from
and upon those of the <HI>latter,</HI> it doth by a ne∣cessary
consequence follow, and become natu∣rally
deducible from thence, that the <HI>Scots</HI> co∣ming
to <HI>settle</HI> with the consent of the <HI>Caciques,</HI>
and of the <HI>Indian People</HI> under them, must there∣upon
be in the like condition with the <HI>Na∣tives,</HI>
and no ways liable to any claim of the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> more than the <HI>Indians</HI> were and are,
and therefore not to be held concerned in, or
made censurable upon any complaints from the
Court of <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P>And that the <HI>Scots</HI> have the <HI>consent</HI> of the
<HI>Natives,</HI> for whatsoever they have done in that
part of <HI>America,</HI> I suppose no Man will be∣tray
such reproachful Ignorance of the present
transactions of the World, or shew so much
impudent effrontery, as to deny it: Neverthe∣less
I shall so far supererrogate, as to give
some demonstrative and undeniable proofs of
it. For so prudent and discreet, as well as
calm and temperate were they, who Comman∣ded
the Ships that Sail'd thither, and arriv'd
on that Coast about the beginning of <HI>Novem∣ber,


<PB N="132" REF="83"/>
1698;</HI> and particularly they who were
sent along in them to have authority over such
as were to land, and to be <HI>directors</HI> of the <HI>Co∣lony</HI>
that was to be establish'd, in case they were
receiv'd and welcom'd, that notwithstanding
of Distempers, that were among them, as well
as of several other inconveniences, under which
they labour'd, as also notwithstanding their
having both a good Naval and a Land Force,
they would not so much as enter into the
Port or Haven, or attempt to set any Body of
Men on shore, until they were encourag'd there∣unto
by the Natives, and having had some of
them on board their Ships, were invited by
them to do it, and withal told that they were
very welcome, and that they had long expe∣cted
them.</P>
<P>Yea, such was their care, circumspection and
tenderness of escaping the very suspicion of
Invading that part of the <HI>Isthmus,</HI> to which
they had directed their course, and upon the
particular Coast whereof they fell in, that
they would not disembark any of their Mili∣tary
Forces, and Companies of Soldiers, until
by some of the Principal among them, who
went on shore with the Indians, that had visited
them on board their Ships, they had ob∣tain'd
a Meeting and Congress with the <HI>Cacique</HI>
in whose Territory the Port lay, and had both
receiv'd his <HI>Consent</HI> for their landing within his
District, and had concerted the terms for their
Settlement within the bounds of his Precincts;
which <HI>Cacique,</HI> being one call'd <HI>Captain Andreas,</HI>
did upon the second Meeting and Congress
between the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Him,</HI> not only agree to
receive them into any part of his Country they


<PB N="133" REF="83"/>
would choose to settle in; but took a Com∣mission
from them, promising that both him∣self,
and those under his Authority would as∣sist
and defend them with the hazard and at the
expence of their Lives.</P>
<P>To which may be added, how that besides
their daily and friendly Coversation and Inter∣course
together, both at first and all along
since testify'd on the part of the <HI>Scots,</HI> by their
presenting the Natives with such things, as
might be most acceptable and pleasing unto
them, and witnessed on the part of the <HI>Indians,</HI>
by their supplying the <HI>Scots</HI> with such Provi∣sions
and Eatables as they either bred or could
catch in Hunting, which they could spare out
of their bare and daily Livelihood and Subsi∣stence;
I say that over and above all this, tho'
a sufficient indication and proof of the <HI>Natives</HI>
receiving them into their Country, and of their
giving their <HI>consent</HI> to the <HI>Scots</HI> landing and
setling among them; There was a formal <HI>Com∣pact</HI>
and <HI>Stipulation</HI> transacted in the most so∣lemn
manner, between <HI>Captain Andreas</HI> and
them, and which was <HI>ratify'd</HI> on the part of
the <HI>Scots,</HI> by their giving unto <HI>Captain Andreas</HI>
a <HI>Sword</HI> and a pair of <HI>Pistols,</HI> and confirmed on
<HI>his part</HI> and that of the <HI>Indians,</HI> by their delivering
a piece of <HI>Turf</HI> and <HI>Twigg</HI> unto the <HI>Scots,</HI> in
token of the Grant which the <HI>Natives</HI> had made
unto the <HI>Scots</HI> of a liberty to settle and establish
a Colony in their Country.</P>
<P>Moreover in further evidence, that the <HI>Scots</HI>
have Erected <HI>Forts,</HI> and Planted their <HI>Calido∣nian</HI>
Colony with the <HI>consent</HI> of the <HI>Natives,</HI>
I shall finally observe, how that upon the ap∣proach
of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> with some Military


<PB N="134" REF="84"/>
<HI>Forces,</HI> to have either surprized the <HI>Scots,</HI> or
in a fair encounter to have beaten and drove
them from thence, the <HI>Indians</HI> in that district
were unanimously ready to have Joyned them
against the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and actually did so with
such a Number of their best men, as the <HI>Scots</HI>
out of a great Multitude that offer'd them∣selves,
Judged convenient to entertain and re∣ceive.
Among whom as there was the <HI>Ca∣cique</HI>'s
own Son; so both <HI>he</HI> and <HI>all</HI> the rest
of the <HI>Indians,</HI> that marched in conjunction
with the <HI>Scots</HI> against the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> behaved
themselves with great Fidelity, and with as
much Bravour, as the sudden flight of the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI>
would allow them occasion and opportu∣nity
of Manifesting.</P>
<P>So that upon the whole, I may now ven∣ture
to conclude, that the settlement of the
<HI>Scots</HI> on the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> is not only
according to the <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>Nations</HI> Just and Law∣ful,
and no ways Injurious to the rights of any,
and that they have in all the steps which they
have therein taken, proceeded according to the
Rules and Measures, by which all the <HI>European</HI>
Nations, who have established Plantations in
any parts of the World, do both Vindicate
themselves from obnoxiousness to blame in
what they did, and do Justifie their claim of
Right and Title unto them, and for the de∣fending
and upholding of them: but I may
presume with Modesty, as well as with Truth,
further to affirm, that there never was a Plan∣tation
or Colony settled by any Nation what∣soever,
or in any part of the World what∣soever
upon Juster principles, or whose esta∣blishment
hath been transacted, with more


<PB N="135" REF="84"/>
Fairness and Candor, and with all due respect
to the reasonable pretences of every one that
had but a shadow or seemingness of claim, as
well as with a tender and full regard to the
property and right of the Natives, whose both
consent and entreaty they have for authorizing
them in what they have done.</P>
<P>Having then fully both declared and de∣monstrated
the legality of the <HI>Scots,</HI> having
Planted a Colony on the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI>
and given a deduction of the grounds of Law
and Justice, upon which that establishment is
Founded and Built, and by which it is evi∣dently
vindicated, from all the exceptions and
complaints that are or can be made against
it by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> or by any others charging
it as unlawful, invasive and criminal: It may
possibly be said in favour of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that
tho' there be no Usurpation made thereby up∣on
their <HI>Rights,</HI> yet thro' the <HI>Adjacency</HI> and
Nearness of that Plantation, to the <HI>Colonies</HI>
which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are allowed to be right∣fully
possessed of, upon the <HI>Isthmus,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI>
have not acted so Kindly and Amicably, as
might have been expected from the subjects
of a <HI>Prince</HI> and <HI>Potentate,</HI> who is in a firm
Alliance, and under all the bonds and measures
of Friendship, with his <HI>Catholick Majesty.</HI> And
therefore that tho' that <HI>Settlement,</HI> be neither
against the Laws, nor the Rules of Justice, yet
it is a Violation of those terms of Decen∣cy,
and of <HI>Bienseance,</HI> which ought to be obser∣ved
among <HI>Monarchs,</HI> that are so cordially
United in Royal and Brotherly Correspon∣dence
and Amity, as his <HI>Britannick Majesty</HI> and
the <HI>King of Spain</HI> are known to be. But in


<PB N="136" REF="85"/>
reference to that allegation, there are several
things which lie obvious to be offer'd.</P>
<P>Namely, That by this <HI>exception,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> are
only censurable for having trespass'd against
the Ceremonies and Punctilio's of what is call'd
Genteel and good Breeding: But not for ha∣ving
offended against the Rules of Justice, or
for having violated the Laws of Property.
So that tho' they may not have acted so man∣nerly
as some People would have had them,
yet they have done nothing that is unlawful
and unrighteous. Nor was it hitherto ever ex∣pected,
and much less requir'd, that a Nation,
rather than to be deficient in a Complement,
should both neglect and abandon their Interest.
Moreover, whatsoever respect the Subjects of
any Soveraign ought to have unto the Rules
of complacence, and the ceremonies of Royal
Courtships, by and according to which Crown'd
Heads do conduct and govern themselves to∣wards
one another, while Matters regarding
the Benefit and Prosperity of a Kingdom do
fall within the compass of the personal trans∣actions
of a few, or do lie under private de∣bates,
and antecedently to their being digested
and concerted into Parliamentary <HI>Bills,</HI> and
before those <HI>Bills</HI> be ratify'd into Laws, and
pass'd into <HI>Acts;</HI> yet there is no deference of
that Nature payable, nor any observance to be
had of meer ceremonies of Courtship, after
they are dispenc'd with, and superceded by a
<HI>Statute,</HI> and the affair wherein they were to have
been practised, is become authorized by a Mu∣nicipal
Law.</P>
<P>

<PB N="137" REF="85"/>
Further it must necessarily also be granted,
that the place where the <HI>Caldionian Colony</HI> is
establish'd, is no nearer to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Planta∣tions,
by its being in the Hands of the <HI>Scots,</HI>
than it was while in the alone and sole Pos∣session
of the <HI>Natives.</HI> Nor is there so much
reason or cause, why the <HI>Spaniards</HI> should fear
the meeting with any thing that may be un∣civil
or hurtful from the <HI>Scots,</HI> as they had rea∣son
to apprehend and dread from the <HI>Indians,</HI>
in that the <HI>latter</HI> are not only a rude and bar∣barous
People, but their ancient, inveterate,
implacable and mortal Enemies; whereas the
<HI>former,</HI> are both a civil, generous, and Christi∣an
People, trained up in all the measures of
Humanity, good Breeding, Morality, and Re∣ligion,
and governing themselves by the Laws
of Revelation, as well as of Nations, and who
withal have never been in War, nor are desi∣rous
to have any Hostility with them.</P>
<P>Yea, the <HI>Alliances</HI> between the <HI>Crowns</HI> of <HI>Great
Britain</HI> and of <HI>Spain</HI> ought to obviate all Jea∣lousie
in the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> of their having any
thing that is either undecent or injurious of∣fer'd
unto them by the <HI>Scots,</HI> who are Subjects
under a Monarch that is in affinity with His <HI>Catho∣lick
Majesty.</HI> Whereas thro' want of Leagues and
Stipulations between the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and those
<HI>Indians,</HI> into whose Territories the <HI>Scots</HI> are re∣ceiv'd,
they had ground of being always and
justly suspicious, that such mischiefs would be
done them, as the power of those <HI>Natives</HI>
could enable them to attempt and execute.</P>
<P>Further, if the <HI>adjacency</HI> and nearness of the
<HI>Scots Plantation</HI> unto the <HI>Spanish Colonies</HI> prove
matter of offence unto the <HI>latter,</HI> and of com∣plaint


<PB N="138" REF="86"/>
against the <HI>former,</HI> the fault thereof is
wholly to be lodg'd upon the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and
therefore the blame ought entirely to fall up∣on
them. Seeing whatsoever the <HI>Scots</HI> are come
into the possession and occupation of, they
have a just and legal Right thereunto, from
the grant and consent of the <HI>Natives,</HI> who
were the undoubted and true Proprietors there∣of;
whereas the whole which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do
there possess, and all the Colonies which they
have settled, hath not only been done with∣out
the leave, but against the will of the an∣cient
and rightful Owners. So that by reason
of the badness of their Title, which flows
from Usurpation, and is built upon their ha∣ving
unjustly invaded what belonged unto o∣thers;
the whole of a reasonable Accusation,
and of a just Complaint, doth lie against them,
and their Plantations; whereas the Title of
the <HI>Scots</HI> proving legal and good, thro' their
having come to inhabit and settle with the al∣lowance,
and upon the invitation of the <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI>
the <HI>nearness</HI> of their <HI>Colony</HI> to those of the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> doth not make them or it obnoxious
to any just and rational Expostulations or Re∣monstrances.</P>
<P>Nor is the case of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made bet∣ter
because of their Colonies being establish'd
long ago, or the condition of the <HI>Scots</HI> ren∣der'd
worse, by reason of their having but
lately begun to sit down, and to plant; in that
the <HI>Title</HI> of the <HI>one</HI> is good from the first mo∣ment;
whereas no length of time can ever
make the claim of the other justifiable: For
as all Lawyers do say, and particularly <HI>Grotius,</HI>
That <HI>tempus in se nullam habet vim effectricem,</HI>


<PB N="139" REF="86"/>
that a possession which is acquir'd unjustly at
first, can never be render'd just by a continu∣ance
in the long occupation of it: So a Title
unto a Place, and a Right in a Settlement,
by the grant and with the consent of the
true Proprietors, is equally good, just and va∣lid
in Law the first day, as it will be after
the having been inherited a Thousand Years.</P>
<P>Moreover, there is not that nearness of the
<HI>Calidonian Colony</HI> to the Plantations which the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> have upon the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> as
some thro' ignorance of <HI>Maps</HI> and unacquain∣tedness
with <HI>Journals,</HI> may, upon a general
noise and clamour, be inclin'd to imagine;
seeing none of the Settlements, which the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> have, and whereof they are in the
actual possession and occupation, are within less
distance than fifteen or sixteen Leagues of the
<HI>Scots</HI> Plantation, which is enough not only to
silence the report, and to put an end to the
pretence of the adjacency between the Colonies
of the one and the other, but for the giving
large bounds for determining between their
Properties and Jurisdiction, and for chalking
out limits of division and separation betwixt
what can any time resonably arise, and come
to be their several and respective Claims. And
as they who would extend their pretence of
Right and Jurisdiction fifteen or sixteen <HI>Leagues</HI>
beyond what they are actually possess'd of,
may as well enlarge it to a <HI>thousand;</HI> so nei∣ther
do the Titles of Princes unto their vari∣ous
and different Dominions and Territories
depend upon the nearness unto, or the re∣moteness
of their Lands from each others,
but upon the legal Property which they have,


<PB N="140" REF="87"/>
and their being either in the actual possession
of them, or of Countries, Cities, Towns, or
Places, upon which they do depend, or upon
the retaining a claim by vertue of an here∣ditary
Right which they have not renounced.
But they must not only be strangely unac∣quainted
with <HI>Histories</HI> as well as with <HI>Maps,</HI>
but stand ignorant of what every Traveller
can inform them, who do not know that even
in <HI>Europe</HI> there are Soveraign Jurisdictions and
Principalities, surrounded by and inclosed with∣in
the Dominions of other Princes, whereof a∣mong
many others, <HI>Orange</HI> and <HI>Avignion</HI> are
undeniable Instances. Nor is it possible to be
avoided, but the Lands and Territories of all
Neighbouring Princes whatsoever, who do
live upon <HI>Continents,</HI> must be <HI>Contiguous</HI> in some
one place or another. And tho' the limits of
some Princes Countries, may in some places be
divided from those of other Potentates by rid∣ges
of Mountains, or by considerable Rivers;
yet for the most part they are no otherwise
distinguished and separated, than by a road,
a hedge, a brook, or by erected Pillars of
wood, or by stones which are set up here and
there.</P>
<P>Finally that wherewith the <HI>Scots</HI> stand char∣ged,
and whereof they are in this particular
accused▪ is no more than what is practised by
all <HI>European</HI> Princes, and States in most parts
or the World, where they have settled Co∣lonies
and Plantations, and that without the
Infraction of the bonds of Amity and Alliances
between them, or the being thought to tres∣pass
against the rules of Decency and Respect,
which the Rulers of Kingdoms and Repub∣licks,


<PB N="141" REF="87"/>
are accustomed to render to each other,
of which it were easy to assign many undenia∣ble
instances, but I shall confine my self to a
few. 'Tis sufficiently known, that all along
on the <HI>Coast</HI> of <HI>Africk,</HI> and particularly on the
River <HI>Gambe,</HI> the <HI>English, French,</HI> and other
<HI>Europeans,</HI> have their settlements intermixed
and contiguous, without clamouring against
or Impeaching of one an other, on the score
of Adjacency. Nor is it to be denied, but that
as <HI>Ceuta, Tangier</HI> and <HI>Mamora,</HI> do lie in the
bosom of the Empire of <HI>Morocco;</HI> so that
they have been possessed by, and have belong∣ed
to different <HI>European</HI> Potentates, without
their complaining of one another upon that
Motive. Neither is it to be in the least con∣tradicted,
but that the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> have
their several and respective <HI>Plantations,</HI> on the
<HI>Island</HI> of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> where, save in the time
of actual War, between these two Crowns,
they live in all friendliness together, each of
them following, carrying on, and promoting
their several <HI>Fisheries,</HI> in and by which as many
Seamen are bred as well as employed, and Na∣vigation
greatly encreased, and Multitudes of
Ships advantageously used; so with a little
cost that is disbursed on <HI>Nets,</HI> and on <HI>Diet</HI>
for Saylers, (which also turns to a National
benefit and gain) there is more Wealth flow∣eth
annually into the Kingdom, or at least
might, if that <HI>Trade</HI> were encouraged, and
cultivated as it deserveth and ought to be, than
by any one branch of our Manufacture what∣soever,
to the Fabricking whereof to make it
Mercantile, there is so much previous expence
required. The same might be instanced with


<PB N="142" REF="88"/>
respect of the <HI>Island</HI> of St. <HI>Christopher</HI>'s, which
belongeth half no the <HI>English,</HI> and half to the
<HI>French,</HI> tho' neither of their shares be well peo∣pled
or Cultivated.</P>
<P>Whereunto may be also added, that the
<HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Portuguese</HI> have their different and
respective <HI>Plantations,</HI> on the coast of <HI>Brasile,</HI>
without any misunderstanding or quarrel be∣tween
them on that account, and to which
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do pretend as much <HI>Right,</HI> as
they do to the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien.</HI> Yea the <HI>Island</HI>
of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> which is Possessed by the <HI>Danes,</HI>
is not far distant from <HI>Porto Rico,</HI> which is in
the occupation of the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> as also very
near unto St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> lyeth the <HI>Crab Island,</HI>
which is pretended unto not only by the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> and the <HI>French,</HI> and particularly by
the <HI>Danes,</HI> but likewise by the <HI>English,</HI> who
were once Possessed of it, and which I do
wonder they endeavour not to repossess them∣selves
of, seeing as it is now void, so it is of
very great importance in it self, and would be
of wonderful usefulness to their <HI>Plantations,</HI>
were it in the <HI>English</HI> hands, and secured by
a good Military force, without which they
well be sure to be Murderd in, or soon drove
out of it by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that inhabit <HI>Porto-Rico.</HI></P>
<P>And to conclude this <HI>Paragraph</HI> with one
instance more, it is observable that whereas
the <HI>English</HI> (as I intimated before upon another
occasion) were in actual Possession of all the
places adjacent to, and Snrrounding the <HI>Mou∣hados,</HI>
which lies betwixt <HI>long Island</HI> and the
<HI>Main,</HI> and is sometimes reckoned a part of
<HI>long Island,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> finding it unoccupied


<PB N="143" REF="88"/>
either by the <HI>English,</HI> or by any other <HI>Europe∣ans,</HI>
sat down and settled a Colony upon it,
in a time of Peace between his <HI>Britannick Ma∣jesty</HI>
and the <HI>States</HI> of <HI>Holland,</HI> and called their
chief Seat and Fortification there, by the name
of <HI>New Amsterdam,</HI> tho' it was wholly en∣compassed
by, and in some places immediately
bordered upon the <HI>English Colonies,</HI> without so
much as the interposure of a River. Whereof the
<HI>English</HI> were so far from complaining, and much
more from making it a matter, and cause of
Hostility between the <HI>English</HI> Crown, and the
<HI>Belgick Republick,</HI> that even upon breaking out
of the War 1672, when all things were al∣ledged,
that could administer the least sha∣dow
for Justifying the commencement of it, on
the part of the <HI>English</HI> who were the Aggres∣sors,
that of the <HI>Dutch</HI> having settled on the
<HI>Mouhados,</HI> was not so much as once mentio∣ned,
nor in the Treaty of Peace in the year
1677, was it ever brought under <HI>Debate,</HI> in
the Congress between the <HI>Plenipotentiaries</HI> of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
and <HI>Holland.</HI> But after the re-entrance of
those two powers again into terms of Amity,
it was by a private capitulation at <HI>London</HI> in
the end of that year, exchanged (as I have al∣ready
said) for <HI>Surinam.</HI></P>
<P>Now the foregoing <HI>Exception</HI> made by the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> in relation to the <HI>Scots,</HI> having acted, if
not unjustly, at least very disingenuously, and un∣kindly
in the <HI>settling</HI> of a <HI>Colony</HI> so <HI>near</HI> unto there
<HI>Plantations,</HI> having been fully considered in the
last Paragraph, and the weakness and vanity of it
so abundantly laid open and Manifested, that
no man will offer to revive and insist upon it
for the future, without incurring the forfeiture


<PB N="144" REF="89"/>
of his reputation, I shall now proceed to exa∣mine
the Pretension and Allegation, of its be∣ing
an <HI>Infraction</HI> of the <HI>Treaties</HI> and <HI>Alliances</HI>
between the <HI>Crowns</HI> of Great <HI>Britain</HI> and of <HI>Spain;</HI>
for the <HI>Scots</HI> to have Landed and begun to
establish a Colony, upon any part of the <HI>Isth∣mus</HI>
of <HI>Darien.</HI> And I shall the rather bring
this to an exact Scrutiny, and under a parti∣cular
and accurate disquisition, in that it hath
been distinguishingly mentioned, and positive∣ly
asserted in the <HI>Memorial</HI> that was presen∣ted
to his <HI>Majesty,</HI> by the command and in
the name of the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI> In which that
<HI>Fact</HI> of the <HI>Scots</HI> is stiled <HI>La rupture de L'alliance
qui a este toûjours entre ces deux Couronnes, Laquelle
sa Majeste d'Espagne a observée jusques icy, &amp;
observe tousjours fort Religieusement, An Infraction
of the Alliance which is between the two Crowns,
which His Spanish Majesty hath hitherto observ'd,
and will Religiously do so.</HI> Which Resolution
of His <HI>Catholick Majesty</HI> to keep and withal
sacredness to observe the <HI>Alliances</HI> which he or
his Predecessors have made with the <HI>Kings</HI> of
<HI>Great Britain,</HI> as it is Noble, Princely and Chri∣stian
(and which I wish the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI>
had better attended, and acted more conso∣nantly
unto in their proc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edings since in rela∣tion
to this affair, but which hereafter we
shall shew that they have not) so it deserveth
to be corresponded with, and answer'd in
the same manner, and with the like measures
of Friendship, Honour, Veracity and Religion.
Nor is there any thing more disgraceful and
ignominious in the esteem of Men, as well as
sinful and criminal in the sight and account of
God, than for <HI>Monarchs</HI> to violate their Roy∣al


<PB N="145" REF="89"/>
Compacts and Agreements, whether with
one another, or with their own Subjects, with∣out
provocations administred to them, where∣by
the Confederacies and Covenants do be∣come
causally and morally dissolv'd. And if
it be universally acknowledg'd, that <HI>Potentates</HI>
having made <HI>Compacts</HI> with their own <HI>Subjects</HI>
are bound in Justice, as well as in Truth and
Honour, to perform them; much more must
it be confess'd, that they are oblig'd to keep
and observe the <HI>Agreements</HI> which they have
made with <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>States</HI> that have no de∣pendance
upon them, but are upon an equal
foot with themselves. Yea, if a King cannot
without Iniquity <HI>violate</HI> an Agreement which
he hath made, with <HI>Subjects</HI> that had been <HI>Re∣bels,</HI>
so as afterwards to punish them for that
Rebellion, in reference to which the <HI>Stipulation</HI>
was, as being pardon'd by the Tenor, and in
the vertue of the <HI>Treaty;</HI> much less can he
break the <HI>Articles</HI> of an <HI>Alliance</HI> with Sove∣raign.
<HI>Rulers,</HI> who tho' they may have been E∣nemies
unto him, could never have been <HI>Re∣bels.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nor are any Persons whatsoever, so much
concern'd to be exact and punctual in keeping
their Faith and in performing of their Promises
as</HI> Princes <HI>are, and that upon the Motive of
Credit and Reputation, as well as by reason of
the obligation of Conscience: For as</HI> Padre
Paolo <HI>says (alluding to a passage of</HI> Livy) That
a Prince who violates his Word,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>His</HI> Opinion <HI>to the</HI> Ve∣netian In∣quisitors of State, <HI>p. 24 Eng. Edit.</HI></NOTE> must invent a
new Religion to make himself believ'd another time,
seeing the Oaths he made in the Religion he pro∣fess'd,
have not been able to bind him; <HI>so there
is more in that of</HI> Tacitus, <HI>than many are a∣ware


<PB N="146" REF="90"/>
of, namely,</HI> Caeteris mortalibus in eo stare
concilia,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Annal.</HI> lib. 4. n. 40.</NOTE> quid conducere sibi putent principum di∣versam
esse sortem, quibus praecipua rerum ad fa∣mam
dirigenda: That while all others may adapt
their Projections and Conduct to their Interest, it
behoveth Princes to calculate their Designs, and to
manage all their Transactions and Administrations
in subserviency to their Honour and Glory.</P>
<P>And as both a <HI>German</HI> Emperor, and a King
of <HI>France</HI> are reported to have said, That if
Faith and Truth were lost in the World, they
ought to be found in the words of Kings;
so whatsoever <HI>Stipulations</HI> have been made with
the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> by His Majesty's <HI>Prede∣cessors,</HI>
as they were the Governors of these
Kingdoms, and the Rectors of the People;
they do no less oblige <HI>him</HI> who sits upon the
Throne, than if they had been first stipulated,
and immediately contracted by <HI>himself.</HI> And
as all the <HI>Leagues</HI> which are by <HI>Civilians</HI> stil'd
<HI>Real,</HI> do not only oblige the Contractors, but
those who succeed unto them in the gover∣ning
Power, unless it be otherwise provided
in the Articles of the Alliance, so all such
Treaties ought to be even observ'd by them
that are their Subjects, and that upon the Mo∣tives
and Obligations of Conscience, as well
as upon the Foundation and Reason of their
Civil and Political Obedience, which they are
to render unto his Commands in the vertue
of his Authority. For such Treaties and Al∣liances
being transacted in the force of that
political Power wherewith Rulers are vested
over their Subjects, and being concerted and
made, with respect to the benefit and advan∣tage
of their People, they are, in the constru∣ction


<PB N="147" REF="90"/>
of the Laws, and in the opinion of Na∣tions,
the acts of the People themselves, no
less than they are the deeds of those who
are their Soveraigns. And indeed that is rightful∣ly
suppos'd to be the <HI>Fact</HI> of the <HI>Community,</HI>
which is done by the <HI>Supreme Ruler</HI> in the ver∣tue
of the Authority that is stated in him by
the Laws, and consequentially to that Trust which
the Subjects have repos'd in him. So that
should the <HI>Scots,</HI> thro' their <HI>Settling</HI> at <HI>Darien,</HI>
appear to be guilty of having violated any <HI>Ar∣ticles</HI>
of solemn <HI>Treaties,</HI> and of having acted
contrary to any <HI>Clauses</HI> in public <HI>Leagues,</HI> they
would therein not only have done what was
<HI>injurious</HI> to the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> but that which
was both disloyal and dishonourable to their
own <HI>King.</HI> And as the <HI>Fact</HI> in the criminal∣ness
of it, doth originally and immediately on∣ly
affect the <HI>Scots,</HI> and is no ways imputable
unto His <HI>Majesty,</HI> save as he should, in case it
be a trespass against Treaties, support and pro∣tect
them in it; so they are bound both
out of the Duty which they owe to His <HI>Ma∣jesty</HI>
as their Soveraign, and in Equity as well
as in Deference to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> either
to return home from <HI>Darien,</HI> and abandon
their Design, or else to vindicate themselves
from having done any thing in that matter,
whereby Treaties and Alliances are violated.
And if they cannot do the <HI>latter</HI> nor will do
the <HI>former,</HI> His <HI>Majesty</HI> will not only be highly
justifiable in the disclaiming to countenance and
defend them, but he will be oblig'd in Truth,
Honour and Justice, to exert that Authority
and Power which are plac'd in him over his
People, for to see right done unto the King


<PB N="148" REF="91"/>
of <HI>Spain,</HI> and reparation made unto the <HI>Spa∣niards.</HI></P>
<P>But that His <HI>Majesty,</HI> instead of falling un∣der
the necessity of doing a thing of that
nature, which will both so much injure, disoblige
and disgust the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation, I shall endeavour to
make it evidently appear, that he may not on∣ly
uphold and protect them, without either
prejudice to his own Reputation and Glory,
or any wrong done to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who
is his Allie, but that he is indispensably ob∣lig'd
as he is their King, as well as in pursu∣ance
of an Act of Parliament, and of his own
Royal Grant, to cover them from all the vio∣lences
which shall be offer'd unto them. And
this I shall do by demonstrating that the <HI>Fact</HI>
of the <HI>Scots,</HI> in their Landing and Settling at
<HI>Darien,</HI> is no ways inconsistent with, nor done
in violation of any <HI>Leagues, Treaties</HI> and <HI>Alli∣ances</HI>
betwixt the Crowns of Great <HI>Britain</HI> and
of <HI>Spain.</HI> And here I must challenge the tak∣ing
it for granted, that there are no <HI>Treaties</HI>
between the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>England</HI> and of <HI>Spain,</HI> but
what are <HI>publick,</HI> and which all Men are or may
be acquainted with. For if Laws themselves, in
the judgment of all Mankind, do not bind and
oblige, antecedently to their being promulga∣ted
and publish'd; much less are Subjects con∣cern'd
in the observation and keeping of <HI>Trea∣ties,</HI>
unless they have had due information and
notice given of them. And should it be gran∣ted,
that such <HI>Federal Contracts</HI> which <HI>Civilians</HI>
stile <HI>Personal,</HI> and which do only respect the
particular benefit of those Princes who do con∣tract
them, and do terminate in their single
and personal Interests, without either affecting


<PB N="149" REF="91"/>
their People, or their Heirs or Successors, I
say should be it allow'd, that there is no neces∣sity
why these Stipulations should be promul∣gated
and made publickly known; yet it is
absolutely requisite, that such Agreements and
Compacts should be so divulged as that they
may be generally understood, wherein the se∣veral
respective Interests of many and va∣rious
Kingdoms and Dominions, and of
different and distinct Soveraigns are both in∣volved
and adjusted, and whereby the car∣riage
and behaviour of their People and Sub∣jects
stand regulated towards one another in
such and such parts of the World; and such
are the Leagues and Alliances pretended and re∣ferr'd
unto in the case before us.</P>
<P>Now the only Treaties between the <HI>Kings</HI>
of Great <HI>Britain</HI> and those of <HI>Spain,</HI> by which
both their own, and their Peoples respective
concerns in <HI>America</HI> are adjusted and regu∣lated,
and the carriage of their <HI>Britannick Ma∣jesty's
Subjects</HI> towards the <HI>Subjects</HI> of their <HI>Ca∣tholick
Majestie,</HI> and reciprocally of the Sub∣jects
of the <HI>Spanish Manarchy</HI> towards <HI>them</HI> of
Great <HI>Britain,</HI> and of the Dominions there∣unto
belonging, stand directed and are made
governable, are the Treaties of <HI>May</HI> 13. 1667,
and of <HI>July</HI> 8. 1670. Which as they are the only
<HI>regulating Treaties</HI> between the two formention'd
<HI>Monarchs</HI> in relation to their several Domini∣ons,
Provinces and Possessions in <HI>America,</HI> so
it is by applying unto and consulting those
<HI>Two Treaties,</HI> that we are to examine and de∣cide,
whether the <HI>Scots</HI> in their having lan∣ded
and begun to establish a <HI>Colony</HI> upon the
<HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> have made themselves guil∣ty


<PB N="150" REF="92"/>
of the <HI>Infraction</HI> of <HI>Alliances,</HI> which I do
psitively affirm, and shall demonstratively
prove, that by those <HI>Facts</HI> they have not done,
nor ought to be so represented or esteemed.
Seeing it will uncontrolably appear unto every
one that will afford himself time and leisure to
view the <HI>Treaties,</HI> and to peruse the Articles
concerted and agreed in them, that they were
meerly <HI>declarative</HI> of what was confess'd to be
in the legitimate and rightful Possession of
those two Kings, and <HI>regulative</HI> of what should
be the behaviour of their several and respe∣ctive
Subjects towards each other in <HI>America,</HI>
as also <HI>restrictive</HI> with reference to their Claims
of any Title or Right to the Provinces, Islands
and Territories, which either of them were in
the possession and occupation of; but that they
were in no ways or manner <HI>exceptive</HI> of, or
<HI>preclusive</HI> from their settling Plantations in
such other Conutries, Districts and Places, as
were neither possess'd and occupy'd by them,
nor by any other European Princes or
States.</P>
<P>And whereas the <HI>Treaty</HI> of 1670, is that
whereby the mutual Interests and Possessions
of the <HI>Kings</HI> of Great <HI>Britain</HI> and of <HI>Spain</HI> are
provided for and adjusted, it may not be a∣miss
to intimate, the occasion and reason of
those <HI>Regulations,</HI> which were concerted and
made by that <HI>Alliance.</HI> Namely that the <HI>Crown</HI>
of <HI>Spain</HI> having antecedently thereunto laid
<HI>Claim</HI> to all <HI>America,</HI> as of right belonging
unto His <HI>Catholick Majesty,</HI> and having accoun∣ted
all the Settlements of every one else, and
particularly of the <HI>English</HI> within that vast <HI>Con∣tinent,</HI>
as likewise in the <HI>American Islands,</HI> to


<PB N="151" REF="92"/>
have been so many Invasions upon their Right,
it was concerted and agreed <HI>by that Treaty,</HI>
that this universal claim and pretence of Title
of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> should be renounc'd and dis∣claim'd.
And that the possession of the <HI>Crown</HI>
of <HI>England</HI> in such <HI>Territories</HI> and Places where
the <HI>English</HI> had planted, should be confess'd
and acknowledg'd to be legal, rightful and
good. Which was the sole and alone business
that was design'd and compass'd in the fore∣mention'd
Treaty. For whereas by the <HI>Treaty</HI>
of 1667, there was only a general and perpe∣tual
Peace concluded and established between
the Dominions and Territories of Great <HI>Bri∣tain</HI>
and those of <HI>Spain,</HI> without the particu∣larizing
of any thing that respected their se∣veral
Plantations in <HI>America.</HI> And whereas
the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> had always question'd the
<HI>Right</HI> of the Kings of <HI>England</HI> to their <HI>Ame∣rican</HI>
Plantations; upon the ground of an uni∣versal
Title, which they claim'd to all the
<HI>West-Indies,</HI> and had particularly controverted
the Right of their <HI>Britannick Majesties</HI> to se∣veral
Plantations which had been made by
the <HI>English</HI> in the <HI>American</HI> part of the World,
upon pretences and allegations, that the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
had forceably drove out the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
and thereupon gotten into possession of seve∣ral
places that had formerly been enjoy'd and
occupy'd by them; therefore it was that upon
these considerations, that whole matter came un∣der
particular Regulation and Adjustment in the
Treaty of 1670; in and by which the Right
and Dominion of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> in those
Countries, Islands, Provinces and Territories,
whereof he was possessed, and so far as they


<PB N="152" REF="93"/>
wert in the actual occupation of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
being confess'd, and provision made for their
quiet and peaceable enjoyment of them: There
was likewise a formal and explicite <HI>Renuncia∣tion</HI>
of all Claim made by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to
whatsoever was in the English possession; but
not one word or syllable, so much as once
mention'd in that whole <HI>Treaty,</HI> concerning
and relative to such parts and places, as were
not at that season in the occupation of the one
or of the other.</P>
<P>Nor can it, in consistency with good Sence
and Reason, be imagin'd, But that if the Right
of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> to all those Territories
and Districts in <HI>America,</HI> which were neither
in the actual occupation of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> nor
of any other European Princes and States, should
by that Treaty have been acknowledg'd to
appertain and belong to the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI>
their Title thereunto would have been speci∣ally
inserted and declared, with an express
exclusion of all others, that should afterwards
desing to be Planters in those void places of
the Continent and Islands of <HI>America.</HI> Nor is
it to be doubted, that if the Right of the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> had been to be confess'd and own'd
in that <HI>Treaty</HI> to all the parts of the Conti∣nent
and Islands that were not possess'd by
Europeans, but that the landing and settling
there, in order to plant, without freedom and
liberty previously granted by the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI>
would have been specify'd as an act of Hosti∣lity
and Infraction of the Alliances. So that
there having been no such care taken, nor
provision made in the foremention'd <HI>Treaty,</HI>
it is an indispensible evidence, that the whole


<PB N="153" REF="93"/>
which was thereby design'd, was only to adjust
and settle Matters, in relation to what each
of those two Crowns were actually in possession
of. And that they were left still under an
equal freedom of settling in any new Places
that were void and unoccupy'd, and no more in
the hands of the one than of the other.</P>
<P>Nor can it fall into the thoughts of any,
who have not lost their Understandings, that
the <HI>English</HI> who are a trading People, and who
finding their Interest and Profit in their <HI>West-India</HI>
Plantations, design'd to extend and en∣large
them in whatsoever other parts of <HI>A∣merica</HI>
they could, where Settlements might be
made, without Invasion upon the Rights of
Europeans, should by that Treaty be conclu∣ded
and stak'd down to plant in no other
places of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> save in those, where
they had Colonies at that time. So that the
whole which was decided, adjusted and stipu∣lated
in and by that <HI>Treaty,</HI> amounted only
to these two things: <HI>First,</HI> That by the 7th
<HI>Article, The King of</HI> Great Britain <HI>and his Heirs
and Successors, shall have, hold, and possess, with
full Right of Empire, Property, and Possession, all
Lands, Regions, Isles, Colonies, and Lordships, si∣tuated
in the</HI> West-Indies, <HI>or in any part of</HI> A∣merica,
<HI>which His Majesty King</HI> Charles II. <HI>did
then hold, or which His Subjects did then possess;
so that no Controversy whatsoever was afterwards
to be rais'd or mov'd in reference to that Matter.</HI>
And, <HI>2dly, That by the</HI> 8th <HI>Article,</HI> The Sub∣jects
of the said <HI>King</HI> should abstain from all
Commerce and Navigation in the Ports, Ha∣vens,
and Places, having Forts, Castles, or Sta∣ples
for Commerce, that is, That the <HI>Subjects</HI>
of <HI>Great Britain</HI> shall not Trade nor Sail into


<PB N="154" REF="94"/>
the Ports and Places which the King of <HI>Spain</HI>
hath in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> nor the <HI>Subjects</HI> of the
<HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> Trade or Sail to the places
which the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Great Britain</HI> doth there
possess, without Licences mutually and recipro∣cally
given in the words and terms, which were
specify'd and set down in a Schedule annex'd to
the Articles of the Treaty.</P>
<P>From both which it doth demonstratively
appear, that all stipulated about and agreed un∣to
in that <HI>Treaty,</HI> was, and is, that the said
Kings and their Subjects, shall not only seve∣rally
and respectively forbear the Invading of
such others Territories, and the injuring of one
another, but that they shall not Navigate, nor
Trade in the Ports and Staples that do belong
unto either, save under such provisions, limi∣tations
and terms as are agreed upon and
expressed. By neither of which are the <HI>Kings</HI>
of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> or their Subjects shut out,
debarred or excluded, from Sayling into such
Ports, Havens and places of <HI>America,</HI> and set∣thing
Plantations any where there, as either
are not inhabited, or where the King of <HI>Spain</HI> is
not in possession and occupation.</P>
<P>But to set this matter yet further in such
a clear and distinct light, as that they who
are the most Prepossessed and Prejudiced, may
see, and be oblig'd to confess, that the <HI>Scots</HI>
have proceeded in the whole affair of their
<HI>Calidonian</HI> Settlement and Plantation, both ac∣cording
to the measures of Law, Justice and
Equity, and with a full deference and respect
unto, and an entire compliance with the <HI>Ar∣ticles</HI>
of the publick <HI>Treaties,</HI> and particularly
of that of 1670: I shall call over the Heads


<PB N="155" REF="94"/>
of some of the Articles of that <HI>Treaty,</HI> and
make those reflection upon them, which they
do Naturally suggest and offer.</P>
<P>Whereas then it is Stipulated, agreed and
provided by the Second <HI>Article,</HI> that there shall
be a <HI>Firm</HI> and <HI>Vniversal Peace</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> as
well as in other parts of the World, between
the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and be∣tween
the Kingdoms, States, Plantations, Co∣lonies,
Forts, Cities and Dominions which do
belong to either of them, and between the
People and Inhabitants under their respective
Obedience, it doth from thence undeniably
appear, that as both the Kings were set upon
an equal foot, and did treat for themselves,
and for the people, and Inhabitants that were
under their respective Obedience, and no fur∣ther
nor for any other, so it is from thence
no less evident, that all matters and things were
left untouched, and undetermined, that did
concern and relate unto such places and parts
of <HI>America,</HI> as were either wholly void and
not at all Inhabited, or that were inhabited on∣ly
by the Native <HI>Indians,</HI> which as that part
of the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien</HI> was, where the <HI>Scots</HI>
have Landed, and are now begun to settle;
so it doth in the way of necessary consequence
from thence undeniably follow, that by the said
<HI>Article,</HI> it remained Free and Lawful, either
for them, or for any other of his <HI>Britannick</HI>
Majesty's <HI>Subjects,</HI> so to do, and therefore
that there neither is, nor can thereby any
<HI>Violation,</HI> or <HI>Infraction</HI> be made of the <HI>Allian∣ces,</HI>
between the Crowns of Great <HI>Britain</HI> and
of <HI>Spain.</HI> For in that the Right, Titles and
Claims, of the Kings of Great <HI>Britain</HI> and


<PB N="156" REF="95"/>
<HI>Spain,</HI> are defined by and circumscribed unto
such Regions, Territories, Plantations, Colo∣nies,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> as do severally and respectively, be∣long
to either of them, it is thereby made un∣controlably
Manifest, that neither of them,
by that <HI>Treaty</HI> had any Rights and Claims
granted, and allowed unto them in reference
to any <HI>places</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> further than as they
were possessed of them, and save as those pla∣ces
were in and under their actual occupation.
And consequently that by the chief purport
and design, and by the whole Tenor of the
<HI>Treaty,</HI> it was left free for each, or either of
them, to make new acquisitions, and to establish
new Plantations in such parts and places of the
<HI>West-Indies,</HI> whether upon the Continent, or in
Islands, as were inhabited by the subjects of
neither of the two Kings, but were either
(as I have said) wholly void, or possessed by the
Native Indians.</P>
<P>Moreover whereas it is Covenanted, adju∣sted
and provided by the Eighth <HI>Article,</HI> that the
subjects of their <HI>Britannick</HI> Majesties, shall not
Sail into, nor Trade in such Ports, Havens,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> as do belong unto the <HI>Catholick</HI> King,
unless with leave, and upon the terms which
are there specified; it doth from thence evi∣dently
and unquestionably follow, that they are
left at liberty to Sail into, and Trade in such
other Ports and Places, as are not the King of
<HI>Spain</HI>'s. And therefore that the Port into
which the <HI>Scots</HI> Sailed, and where they are
establishing a Colony, being neither then, nor
having been at any time since, in the possession
of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they are in their having so
done, altogether unaccusable of the being guilty


<PB N="157" REF="95"/>
of any crime or misdemeanor, or of having in
the least transgressed against publick and solemn
<HI>Treaties.</HI></P>
<P>Further whereas it is concerted, and agreed
by the same <HI>Article,</HI> that the <HI>Subjects</HI> of the
<HI>King</HI> of <HI>England</HI> should not Sail into any
Ports or Havens, that had Fortifications, Ma∣gazins,
or Warehouses possessed by the King
of <HI>Spain,</HI> it may from thence be <HI>Apodictically</HI>
Inferred and Concluded, that it continued <HI>Free</HI>
and <HI>Lawful</HI> for them, to Sail into <HI>Ports,</HI> and
to Trade, where there were no Fortifications,
Magazins nor Warehouses at all, and much
less any appertaining unto, or in the Possession of
the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> Both which being unque∣stionable
with reference to <HI>Acla,</HI> and the
Creeks, Ports, Harbours and Places adjacent
thereunto, it may thereupon be Justly affir∣med,
and solidly concluded, that neither the
<HI>Scots,</HI> nor any other of his <HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty's
<HI>Subjects,</HI> were by that Treaty precluded and
debarred from Landing, Trading and Settling
there, and that the <HI>Scots</HI> thro' their having
sit down, and become Planters in that place,
are altogether innocent of the <HI>Infraction</HI> of any
such <HI>Alliances.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, whereas it is agreed and provi∣ded
by the <HI>tenth Article,</HI> that in case the <HI>Ships</HI>
that do belong to either of those Kings, or
to the <HI>Subjects</HI> of either of them, shall by stress
of Weather, or otherwise be forced into the
Rivers, Creeks, Bays, or Ports belonging to
the other in <HI>America,</HI> that thereupon they shall
be received kindly, harbour safely, and be trea∣ted
with all Humanity and Friendship; it may
from thence be inferred and deduced, that as


<PB N="158" REF="96"/>
both the Kings are thereby stated upon an e∣qual
bottom and foot, and the rights of both,
and of each of them respectively are restri∣cted
and determined to particular Rivers,
Creeks, Bays, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> so it is also thereby mutu∣ally
confessed and acknowledged, that there are
other and of all those several <HI>Kinds,</HI> in which
neither of them have any Property, Interest
or Concernment, and that it might be free for
the Ships of either of them to Sail into such, and
there to Anchor, and to furnish themselves
with what they wanted, and the places affor∣ded,
and to continue there during their own
Pleasure, and to do in such places, whatsoever
they should judge to be for their Advantage
and Interest, without incurring the imputation
of being accounted injurious to one another,
or of becoming liable to a charge and com∣plaint
against them, of having Violated <HI>Alli∣ances.</HI>
And by consequence, that the Port
<HI>Acla</HI> being such, the <HI>Scots</HI> might Sail thither,
land and settle there, without either asking
leave of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> or of becoming there∣upon
censurable by them, of having therein
done any thing, that is either against the Laws
of Nations, or an Infraction of <HI>Alliances</HI> and
<HI>Treaties</HI> between the Crowns of Great <HI>Britain</HI>
and <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Again whereas it is Concerted and Stipula∣ted
in the Fifteenth <HI>Article,</HI> that Nothing
in the said <HI>Treaty</HI> shall derogate from any
<HI>Preheminence</HI> Right and Dominion of any of
the Confederates in the <HI>American Seas,</HI> Channels
or Waters, but that they shall have and re∣tain
the same in as full and ample manner,
as may of right belong to them, with and


<PB N="159" REF="96"/>
under the provision, that Navigation shall not
be disturb'd; I desire in reference to that <HI>Ar∣ticle</HI>
that it may be observ'd, how tho' the
<HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> having made a claim of Privi∣lege,
Pre-eminence and Jurisdiction in and o∣ver
the <HI>American</HI>-Seas, which was no ways
granted and yielded unto them by the <HI>Crown</HI>
of <HI>England,</HI> but the right in and over those
Seas left in the same state that it was before;
yet neither in that Article, nor in any other
of the said <HI>Treaty,</HI> is there any claim of Ju∣risdiction,
Soveraignty or Dominion, made by
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> either over such parts of the
Continent or of Islands, whereof neither they
themselves were possess'd, nor a right of Pro∣perty
and Dominion in and over them, had
been claimed by and granted to the <HI>English,</HI>
of which omission of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> there can
be no other reason assign'd, but that they knew
no claim of that Nature would have been al∣low'd
them; and that the very mentioning of
it, would have occasion'd a formal, explicite,
and stipulated Reduction and Restriction of
the pretensions of Title and Right in <HI>America</HI>
to the bounds and limits of what is actually
occupy'd by them, which they were not willing
to have decided and determin'd by an express
Contract and Stipulation to the making and
rectifying whereof there was their own con∣currence
and consent. Tho' in Fact no Na∣tion
will grant them a right of Property and
Jurisdiction in and over more, nor have any
<HI>European Princes</HI> whatsoever hitherto done it. I
do the rather make this observation, in that a
Claim of Jurisdiction and Soveraignty over Seas
and Oceans, is more liable to exceptions, than


<PB N="160" REF="97"/>
a claim of Dominion over Lands, either upon
Continents or Islands, in that it is universally
granted, that Princes are capable of having
their several just, supreme and divided Proper∣ties
in and over <HI>Lands,</HI> and withal as generally
deny'd, that any Potentate whatsoever can right∣fully
claim a sole Property in and Jurisdiction
over <HI>Seas,</HI> preclusive of the Rights of other Prin∣ces
to Sail and Navigate upon them.</P>
<P>Finally, there may be this one thing yet ad∣ded,
as an indisputable evidence, and a full
confirmation, that there was no right of Pro∣perty
and Jurisdiction in and over any Lands,
Territories or Districts, in <HI>America, granted</HI>
in the <HI>Treaties</HI> either of 1667, or of 1670, by
the King of <HI>Great Britain</HI> unto the Crown of
<HI>Spain,</HI> save so far as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were in
actual <HI>Possession,</HI> in that the <HI>English</HI> have since
those <HI>Treaties</HI> sit down upon that part of <HI>A∣merica</HI>
which is come to be call'd <HI>Pensilvania,</HI>
and have there establish'd large and flourishing
Colonies, and that without the <HI>Spaniards</HI> ha∣ving
once offer'd to <HI>complain</HI> of it as a <HI>violation</HI>
of <HI>Treaties</HI> and <HI>Alliances▪</HI> between the two
Crowns.</P>
<P>Having fully vindicated the <HI>Scots Settlement</HI>
at <HI>Darien,</HI> from the being either against the
<HI>Laws</HI> of Nations, or in opposition to publick
<HI>Treaties</HI> and <HI>Alliances,</HI> and having withal justi∣fy'd
them both as to the <HI>Fact,</HI> and with respect
to the Steps and Methods, in which they
begun and have promoted it, I know but of
one thing, besides what hath been already con∣sider'd,
that can be reasonably alledg'd, against
either the Justice or the Equity of it. Name∣ly
that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have not only been esteem'd


<PB N="161" REF="97"/>
the Proprietors of that <HI>Isthmus</HI> by divers <HI>Eu∣ropean</HI>
Nations, but that they have been de∣clar'd,
as well as accounted, so by the <HI>English</HI>
in two remarkable Instances. Whereof the
<HI>First</HI> is, That several English Merchants, ha∣ving
agreed upon, and provided a <HI>Fund</HI> of set∣tling
a Plantation at <HI>Port-Royal</HI> in the Bay of
<HI>Mexico,</HI> in order to the cutting of <HI>Logwood,</HI>
were refus'd the support and protection of
the Government for carrying it on, and only
permitted to manage a Trade there at their
own hazard and peril. And as for the <HI>Second,</HI>
which comes closer to the Question which we
have been debating, It is said that certain
<HI>English-men</HI> having undertaken to settle in <HI>Da∣rien,</HI>
and brought the proposal of it before the
<HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Trade</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> by whom it was
laid before the <HI>Lords Justices</HI> in His Majesty's
absence, and by them transmitted to the <HI>King
Himself,</HI> how that after a mature considera∣tion,
it was judg'd and pronounc'd to be a
Design and Project, that would be an <HI>encroach∣ment</HI>
upon <HI>Spain,</HI> and therefore let fall and a∣bandon'd.
And that the <HI>case</HI> of the <HI>Scots</HI> be∣ing
parallel to that it ought to meet with the
like censure, and be judg'd <HI>invasive</HI> upon the
<HI>Rights</HI> of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>All which tho' it hath been sufficiently both
obviated and answer'd in what hath been al∣ready
said, yet in compassion as well as in
condescension to the Infirmities and Weaknes∣ses
of the greatest part of Mankind, who suf∣fer
themselves to be impos'd upon and misled
in their Opinions and Judgments, of Actions
and Matters of all kinds, by trifling Reasons
and Considerations of very little moment,


<PB N="162" REF="98"/>
especially when their Understandings have re∣ceiv'd
a wrong byass, and are previously too
much over-rul'd by prepossessions and prejudi∣ces
arising from National Pique, or particular
Envy; I shall offer several things in way of
Reply to what is alledg'd, and bestow several
Reflections upon it. Whereof some of them
shall be more <HI>general</HI> respecting <HI>both</HI> the
<HI>cases,</HI> and the rest <HI>particular</HI> relative unto <HI>each</HI>
of them singly and apart. And tho' I shall
behave my self in the whole with that Mode∣sty
and Deference towards His Majesty and
them that have either had the universal Ad∣ministration,
or any part of it, as not to give
the least occasion for censure or blame; yet I
hope I may expect to be so far both indulg'd and
justify'd in the Vindication of the legal and
righteous Fact of a whole Kindom, as not
from too much Pusilanimity on the one hand,
or Sycophancy on the other, to suffer that Na∣tion
to lie under causeless suspicion of Inju∣stice.</P>
<P>In the way therefore of a <HI>general Reply,</HI> I
desire it may be observ'd, that as the senti∣ments
and opinions of no Body of Men what∣soever,
and much less of a few Individuals,
are the Measures and Standards of <HI>Moral</HI>
Right and Wrong, but that the Laws of Na∣ture
and Nations are; so the Acts and Pro∣ceedings
of the People of <HI>Great Britain</HI> are not
to be finally decided and determin'd, with re∣spect
to their legality, or their illegality, and
their being judg'd lawful or unlawful, before
Civil Tribunals, and at Humane Benches, save
by the acknowledg'd Laws of Nations and
the respective Municipal Laws of the King∣doms.


<PB N="163" REF="98"/>
For tho' the projecting or the acting
disagreably to the Opinion of this or that
<HI>Board,</HI> may in some cases prejudice the Un∣dertakers
and Doers; yet that singly, precise∣ly,
and abstractedly, doth neither render the
Design nor the Execution of it, at all times,
unwise, and much less at any time unlawful and
unjust.</P>
<P>Nor is it moreover unworthy the being ta∣ken
notice of, That there is a great difference
to be made between the discouraging a Pro∣jection,
while it is only in proposal and in
<HI>Embryo,</HI> and the condemning and rescinding it,
after it hath been put in Execution. Seeing
by the first the Undertakers are only advis'd
and caution'd, whereas by the last, they are
not only disoblig'd and disgusted, but really
prejudic'd and injur'd.</P>
<P>Further, There is likewise a great discri∣mination
to be made between what is advise∣able
at one season, and what is justifiable as
well as prudential at another. For the exi∣gencies
which at one time we may be under,
of having the favour and assistance of a neigh∣bouring
Nation, may render it impolitick to
countenance that, which at another time, when
we stand rescu'd from attendance to any other
Measures, save those of Law, Justice and Truth,
it▪ were both to abandon and sacrifice our In∣terest
to neglect it.</P>
<P>Further, The inhibiting of the Subjects of
<HI>England,</HI> from proceeding in the foremention'd
Designs, may have been founded upon such
Motives and Reasons, as do no ways affect
that, which the <HI>Scots</HI> have undertaken. Nor
can the cases therefore be render'd parallel,


<PB N="164" REF="99"/>
unless the circumstances could be made appear
to be equal: So that the Kingdom of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
being altogether ignorant of the Induce∣ments
upon which the Resolutions were ta∣ken
in the cases of those <HI>English-men,</HI> it is not
to be expected, that their <HI>Cases</HI> should have
been look'd upon by the <HI>Scots</HI> as presidents
for their conduct, or that they should have go∣vern'd
themselves by any rules, save those of
their own Interest and Profit, in subordination
to the Laws of Nations, public Alliances, and
the Municipal Statutes of that Kingdom.</P>
<P>Moreover, there is a great difference to be
made between checking the Inclinations of a
few <HI>private</HI> Men, who possibly might be rather
designing their own personal advantage, than
a National good; and the crossing the unani∣mous
Desires of a whole <HI>Kingdom,</HI> who as they
knew the thing to be lawful in which they were
engag'd, so they did believe, that the pursuing
it was indispensably needful, in order to their
Welfare and Prosperity.</P>
<P>Finally, whatsoever Authority His <HI>Majesty</HI>
stands vested with, or whatsoever liberty his
<HI>Ministers</HI> are allow'd to have in reference to
affairs previously to <HI>Acts</HI> of Parliament con∣cerning
them, or in relation to Matters that
do not directly fall under the Regulation of
Laws and Statutes; yet they do become not
only uncontrolable by <HI>them,</HI> but even are not
to be superceded by His <HI>Majesty,</HI> after that
they are once establish'd by Laws, and con∣firm'd
by Charters. For such things as are once
made lawful by Acts of Parliament, are put
out of the reach both of the King and of his
Council, as to their considering afterwards whe∣ther


<PB N="165" REF="99"/>
they be convenient. But having upon ano∣toer
occasion mention'd this before, I will not
here insist upon it again.</P>
<P>And as for the <HI>particular Reflections,</HI> which I
intend to make upon <HI>each</HI> of the <HI>Cases</HI> apart,
I shall dispatch them with what expedition I
can, and in the order that the <HI>Cases</HI> are laid
down. In reference therefore to the <HI>first,</HI>
which was the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>England</HI>'s discoura∣ging
such <HI>English Merchants,</HI> as had design'd to
have settled at <HI>Port-Royal</HI> in the bottom of
the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Campeachy;</HI> I do say that there is
no likeness, alliance or affinity, between what
was intended to have been done by some <HI>Eng∣lish
there,</HI> and what is done by the <HI>Scots</HI> in the
<HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien.</HI> In that the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Campea∣chy,</HI>
lying in the Province of <HI>Nicaragua,</HI> within
the Diocess of <HI>Stiapa;</HI> which Dominion
and Bishoprick, being part of the ancient <HI>Em∣pire</HI>
of <HI>Mexico,</HI> which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> conquer'd
after their usual way of Killing the Inhabitants,
and converting the Land to their own use, and
unto which they have been confess'd to have
a right by <HI>Prescription,</HI> can be no <HI>parallel</HI> unto,
nor bear any similitude with that of the <HI>Isth∣mus</HI>
of <HI>Darien,</HI> where the <HI>Scots</HI> have establish'd
their <HI>Colony</HI> of <HI>Calidonia;</HI> seeing as the <HI>Isthmus</HI>
was never any part either of the <HI>Mexi∣can</HI>
or the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Empires; so that particu∣lar
District of the <HI>Isthmus,</HI> where the <HI>Scots</HI> have
begun to settle a <HI>Plantation,</HI> was never <HI>subdu'd</HI>
by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> nor did the Natives at any
time acknowldege their having Jurisdiction o∣ver
them. So that tho' for the <HI>English</HI> to
have <HI>settled</HI> in the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Mexico,</HI> might be ac∣counted
an <HI>Encroachment</HI> upon the <HI>Right</HI> of the


<PB N="166" REF="100"/>
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> yet it can no ways from thence follow,
that for the <HI>Scots</HI> to <HI>settle</HI> at <HI>Acla,</HI> which had
never been subdu'd or possess'd by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
is to be held an Invasion upon any of the Terri∣tories,
or an Encroachment upon the Rights of
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Crown.</P>
<P>Moreover, for the Council of <HI>England</HI> to have
given <HI>permission</HI> to the English Subjects to Sail
unto, and to stay and cut Logwood in the <HI>Bay</HI>
of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> without the leave and consent
of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> was a greater <HI>encroachment</HI>
upon the <HI>Rights</HI> of His <HI>Catholick Majesty,</HI> than
it would be to have the <HI>Scots</HI> authorized and
justified in their erecting a <HI>Colony</HI> on that part of
the <HI>Isthmus</HI> where they landed and are sit down.
Seeing it is contrary to all the Measures both
of Justice and Amity, for a Government to
connive at an Invasion upon the Dominions
of a Prince, in whom a Title, Jurisdiction and
Property are allow'd to stand vested in and o∣ver
those Territories; whereas it interferes with
no rules of Law, Equity or Friendship, for a
Government to authorize and empower its
Subjects to plant in a place where that Prince
was never acknowledg'd (nor justly could be)
to have a Soveraignty or Right.</P>
<P>Further, whatsoever the opinion of the Court
and Council of <HI>England</HI> may have been as to
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having such a Right to the <HI>Bay</HI>
of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> as doth debar and preclude all
others from coming thither, without obtaining
of leave from the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> yet there are o∣ther
Courts in the World, who have thought
that it was free for them to settle in that <HI>Bay,</HI>
without a Grant and Concession from the Crown
of <HI>Spain,</HI> whereof there needed no other in∣stances


<PB N="167" REF="100"/>
to be assigned, but that of the <HI>French,</HI>
who have several times been endeavouring to
have settled on the <HI>River de Spiritu Sancto</HI> in
that <HI>Bay,</HI> and who are at this time designing
to establish a <HI>Colony</HI> on the <HI>River Mischasipe</HI> upon
the <HI>Mexican Gulph.</HI></P>
<P>Finally whatsoever the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>England,</HI>
might have said to those <HI>English</HI> Merchants,
for discouraging their settling at <HI>Port Royal</HI>
in the Bay of <HI>Mexico;</HI> yet it is unquestiona∣bly
certain, that the project of the <HI>English</HI>
for settling and cutting Logwood there, ob∣tained
and took effect, in that they have had
for several years, Logwood in that place ap∣propriated
unto them, which they have cut
and brought home for the accommodating of
<HI>English</HI> Dyers.</P>
<P>And as to the Second <HI>Case,</HI> concerning the
Prohibition of those <HI>English</HI> Merchants and
Traders, to settle in <HI>Darien,</HI> whose <HI>Proposals</HI>
for the establishing a Plantation in that part
of <HI>America,</HI> had been laid before the <HI>King,</HI>
as well as the <HI>Lords Justices,</HI> I shall in the first
place declare, that the circumstances of that
being wholly unknown to me, I shall not assume
the Confidence, to pronounce any thing posi∣tively
in reference to the particular grounds
and reasons, of the Opinion and Judgment
of his Majesty, the Lords Justices, and the
Council about it, only it may not only be
conjectured, but affirmed with Confidence, that
the forbidding all proceedings in that enter∣prize,
was upon Motives of State, rather than
of Justice, and that it was done because of
the Inconveniencies, which at that Juncture
might have ensued; and not by reason of the


<PB N="168" REF="101"/>
illegality of it. For as the <HI>Proposal</HI> was made
at a time, when we were in <HI>Confederacy</HI> with
the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> for the carrying on a
War against a Great and Powerful Monarch,
and as the <HI>Spanish</HI> Dominions were the chief
seats of the War, and the Ports and Havens
of <HI>Spain</HI> absolutely needful, as well as ex∣treamly
useful, for the management of our
Commerce in the <HI>Mediteranean</HI> and <HI>Levant,</HI> so
the preserving of <HI>Spain</HI> firmly in the Alliance,
was upon many other accounts, (which I shall
not enumerate) indispensably necessary, both
for the upholding of the War, and in order
to the success of it, in favour of the Allies
in general, and particularly of Great <HI>Britain.</HI>
So that upon whatsoever political Inducements,
that proposal was discountenanced, and re∣jected,
yet I may venture to affirm, that it
was not upon the foot and motive of the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
having a right and property in, and
a Soveraignty and Jurisdiction over, the whole
<HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien.</HI></P>
<P>For as that would have been an acting in
direct opposition, to the general Foundation
and <HI>Principle,</HI> which both the <HI>English</HI> and all
<HI>European Nations</HI> proceed upon, in their esta∣blishing
of Colonies in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and in
Justification of the rightful and legal Domi∣nion,
that they have over the Lands, Territories,
Provinces, Islands, which they have acquired
there: Namely that no ones right in that part
of the World, doth extend beyond possession
and occupation; so it were to have debarred
and shut out, the <HI>English</HI> as well as all other
<HI>Europeans,</HI> not only from erecting new Colonies
in those places of <HI>America,</HI> where the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI>


<PB N="169" REF="101"/>
are in the possession, and have the Domi∣nion;
but from settling any New Plantations
in such parts of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> where the Na∣tives
are the sole Soveraigns and Occupiers.
Which is a thing both so absurd in it self,
and so directly opposite to the Interest, Pros∣perity
and Honour of <HI>England,</HI> that it were
to entertain an opinion inconsistent with
good Manners, so much as once to imagine,
that either the King, the Lords Justices, or
any <HI>English</HI> Ministers of State, should be so
weak and imprudent, and so neglectful of the
Welfare and Glory of Great <HI>Britain,</HI> as ei∣ther
to fall into such a pernicious measure
of themselves, or to be <HI>dup'd</HI> into it by o∣thers.</P>
<P>Moreover to have been influenced to reject
the foresaid <HI>Proposal,</HI> upon the reasons and
motives of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> having an Univer∣sal
and a Sole <HI>Right</HI> in the <HI>Isthmus,</HI> would have
been to have acted in the highest way of In∣justice
to the Natives, thro' the ejecting them
out of their Property and Jurisdiction in and
over those Lands and Territories, whereof they
are both the legal and rightful owners, and
the alone occupiers and possessors, to a
great extent of ground upon that <HI>Straight,</HI> and
thro' the vesting the Property and Dominion
in the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who have no Title or Claim
to a great part of those Territories, either
by conquest or the consent of the Indians.
Nor can any thing more disgraceful and un∣righteous,
as well as undecent and unman∣nerly
be conceived of his Majesty, and of those
that are in the Administration, than that they
should act upon an Inducement, that would


<PB N="170" REF="102"/>
import a robbing of the rightful Proprietosr
of their Inheritances, and a deposing of here∣ditary
and legal Governours, from their Lord∣ships
and Jurisdictions, to place; and settle them
in others to whom they do no ways apper∣tain.</P>
<P>Finally, should we suppose his <HI>Majesty,</HI> and
the <HI>Lords Justices</HI> to have Prohibited the fore∣said
<HI>English</HI> Merchants and Traders to <HI>settle</HI>
upon the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> because it would
have been an encroachment upon the rights of
the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain;</HI> we must be obliged to add,
that they therein acted incongruously to the
measures of other Princes and civil Ministers,
who have been both encouraging and endea∣vouring
the Planting of Colonies upon or
near to that <HI>Isthmus,</HI> with the consent of the
Natives, without the least respect had to the
Claim and Title of his Catholick Majesty,
whereof having given an instance before, I shall
not here repeat it.</P>
<P>So that having represented and finished, what∣soever
I account needful to be said for Justi∣fying
the <HI>Scots Settling</HI> a <HI>Colony</HI> at <HI>Darien</HI> to be
according to the Laws of Nations, and agreea∣ble
to all the measures of Justice and Friend∣ship,
and not to be an Usurpation upon the
right of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> nor to interfer
with any <HI>Alliances</HI> between his <HI>Britannick</HI> Ma∣jesties,
and the Catholick King; and having vin∣vicated
that Fact of theirs, from all the excep∣tions
which are made either against the lawful∣ness,
or the friendliness of it; It will now be
a piece of prudence, as well as of decency to
bespeak the <HI>favour</HI> and <HI>assistance</HI> of the <HI>Parlia∣ment</HI>
and <HI>People</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> for their being sup∣ported


<PB N="171" REF="102"/>
and protected in that undertaking. Nor
shall I so much endeavour to perswade and influ∣ence
them thereunto upon the Motives of genero∣sity
and Kindness, as upon the Inducements
that they will find the doing it, to be greatly
for the advantage of the Crown and Subjects of
<HI>England.</HI> For as much might be expected to be
done in behalf of the <HI>Scots</HI> by that powerful and
opulent Nation, upon the reason of their being
not only Neighbours to one another upon the
same Island, and under the Soveraignty and Go∣vernment
of one and the same Monarch; but
because of the many Offices of Councel and
Aid, which they have since the Union of the
two Crowns, mutually render'd to one another;
and that the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> in particular,
hath espoused the concerns of <HI>England</HI> in a way
of Singular Amity and with extraordinary fi∣delity
and zeal, whensoever they have seen them
involved under difficulties and dangers; so that
which is now desired from the <HI>English</HI> towards
the <HI>Scots</HI> is not near what the Ancestors of the
<HI>former</HI> have render'd unto those of the <HI>latter</HI>
heretofore, In that besides their having had the
<HI>Counties</HI> of <HI>Northumberland, Cumberland,</HI> and <HI>West∣morland</HI>
several times granted and confirmed un∣to
them, to be held in <HI>Fee</HI> of the Crown of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
in recompence for the Services and assi∣stances
which they had yielded unto the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI>
in their distresses: We are assured by an
English Writer, that it was provided for in
a course of Law under the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI>
the <HI>Confessor,</HI> that the <HI>Scots</HI> should be held <HI>Deni∣zons</HI>
of <HI>England</HI> and enjoy the same privileges
with themselves, because of the Aid which they
had render'd to that Kingdom against the


<PB N="172" REF="103"/>
<HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Norwegians.</HI> But I shall chuse to
wave the laying the recollection and considera∣tion
of all or of any of these before them, which
touch upon the head of gratitude, and shall
think it more advisable to address them by other
Topicks, namely by those that shall refer to the
Benefits of Strength, Riches, and Honour, which
will thereby accrue, and redound unto the King∣dom
of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>For how mighty and wealthy soever, the Na∣tion
must in truth stand acknowledged to be,
yet it must also be confess'd, that under the
great variety and plenty of Natural and Arti∣ficial
productions, which their own Country
and the Dominions thereunto belonging do
afford, they have not the advantage of being
furnish'd with <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Silver Mines,</HI> which yield
the Metal and Bullion that make the <HI>Funds</HI> of
Trade, raise the Bulworks of safety, admini∣ster
the Supplies of plenty and pleasure in peace,
and enableth to muster Armies, and equip
Fleets in times of War. And tho' it is not to
be denyed, but that by means of their Manu∣factures,
and by reason of their Industry and
their application unto, and skill in the manage∣ment
of a large and universal Commerce, they
have a great Share of the <HI>Treasures</HI> of the <HI>Spa∣nish
West-Indies</HI> flowing annually unto them;
yet it is with great hazard, at much expence,
and after having been long out of their princi∣pal,
that they become possest of it in those me∣thods.
And it is also demonstrable, that a much
greater proportion of <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Silver</HI> will both
come into private Banks, and into the pub∣lic
Exchequer of <HI>England,</HI> by the <HI>Scots</HI> having
such <HI>Mines</HI> within the bounds of their Colony


<PB N="173" REF="103"/>
of <HI>Darien,</HI> than hitherto hath, or ever can, in
the ways of meer Commerce with the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>Nor ought it here to be omitted, that the
<HI>Mines</HI> in the occupation of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in that
part of <HI>Darien,</HI> which lie nearest, to the plan∣tation
of <HI>Caledonia,</HI> and in which they work at
present, do so abound in the very <HI>Oare</HI> of Gold,
that every <HI>Negro</HI> whom they employ, is bound
to gain daily to his Master,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Dalby Thomas'<HI>s</HI> Historical account of the West-Indie Colo∣nies <HI>p.</HI> 17. and 18.</NOTE> as much as doth a∣mount
after it is refined to <HI>thirty Lewis d'ors:</HI>
whereas such as are employed in the <HI>English
American Sugar Plantations,</HI> which are reckoned
to be the most profitable of any they have,
do not after all the expence upon them in their
food, cloaths, and other accommodations, earn a∣bove
<HI>one hundred pound Sterling</HI> gain a head <HI>per
annum</HI> to their Master, which is not near so much
in a whole year, as the other bringeth in <HI>per</HI>
week.</P>
<P>And as the Goods and Commodities sent out
of <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Spain,</HI> which bring them returns
in <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Silver,</HI> will be transmitted imme∣diately
to <HI>Darien</HI> with more speed, and at
less expence, as well as hazard, than they go
now to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> by
making the Tower of <HI>Cadiz, Malaga</HI> and
<HI>Sevil;</HI> and the profit thereupon be much the
greater to the <HI>English</HI> Merchants; so a good
part of the Treasure which cometh directly
into <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon the alone and single ac∣count
of the <HI>Caledonian</HI> Company, will in di∣vers
ways so circulate, as to come at last to cen∣ter
in <HI>England.</HI> Seeing besides what must ne∣cessarily
flow in thither in payments, both for
what of their own productions, and what of
Foreign goods that have been first imported


<PB N="174" REF="104"/>
to <HI>England,</HI> will be called for and purchased
by the <HI>Scots,</HI> it is not to be imagined how
much will come to be brought in, and spent
there in ways of Diversion and Pleasures by
all sorts of people of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and especially
by the Nobility and Gentry.</P>
<P>For as it is too well Known, that the ge∣nerality
of the <HI>Scots,</HI> whose circumstances do
quality them for and allow it, have much in
them of the humour and even Vanity of Tra∣velling,
and are inclinable enough to spend in
proportion to the quantity of their Cash; so
thro' <HI>London's</HI> being the Metropolitical Seat of
the Government, and the place where the
King has his residence, the Court is kept,
and all grand Affairs of State, as well as ma∣ny
of the most important concerns of parti∣cular
men are transacted, they will be certain
to come thither in far greater Numbers than
they now do; some out of Courtship, and o∣thers
in complyance with the exigency of
their affairs, and all of them maintain a Port,
and live at a Charge answerable to the weight
and depth of their pockets. Which will not
only be of great profit and advantage to the
Northern roads, thro' which they must go and
return, and of divers other parts of the King∣dom
to which their Pleasure, Health or Cu∣riosity
may tempt them, but especially it will
be of great advantage to <HI>London,</HI> seeing besides
what they will spend during their Residence,
and in the making a figure, while they are
there, they will also furnish themselves in that
<HI>Metropolis</HI> with such accoutrements of State,
and provisions of houshold furniture, as they
shall esteem to be needful either for their gran∣deur,


<PB N="175" REF="104"/>
or their conveniency when they go
home.</P>
<P>Moreover it is not to be questioned, but
that the <HI>English,</HI> upon very easy and Honoura∣ble
terms and conditions, may be admitted in∣to
a <HI>Partnership</HI> in the Plantation, and into a
share of Trade with the <HI>Scots.</HI> Which as it
will draw a considerable part of all that is
either <HI>Dug</HI> out of <HI>Mines,</HI> or that is otherwise
produced within the District of that <HI>Colony,</HI> as
well as of whatsoever shall accrue to the <HI>Com∣pany,</HI>
by a Traffick drove at <HI>Darien,</HI> directly
and immediately into <HI>England;</HI> so it will both
greatly enlarge the Trade and Commerce of
<HI>England,</HI> and mightily encrease their Wealth.
For as the <HI>Scots</HI> were so neighbourly and
kind upon the enacting of the <HI>Law,</HI> for the
establishment of a <HI>Company,</HI> for Trading to
<HI>Africa</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> as to make the first
<HI>Offer</HI> to the <HI>English</HI> of Joining in the Subscrip∣tions
to a Stock and Fund, so as to become
Partners with them in any Plantation they
should settle, and in whatsoever they should
acquire; so it may not only be hoped, but
confidently affirmed, that they will not now
be opposite, nor averse, to the receiving them
upon such terms, as may be safe and credita∣ble
to both Kingdoms. Nor can the <HI>Parliament</HI> of
<HI>England,</HI> in their approaching Session, fall upon any
matter, that will be of more National con∣cernment,
or from which more benefit will
arise to the Government and people of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
than to consider and advise, how the
<HI>Kingdoms</HI> may become so <HI>Incorporated</HI> with re∣spect
to that <HI>Colony,</HI> as that upon a congress
between Commissioners, authorized respective∣ly


<PB N="176" REF="105"/>
by both Nations to treat and agree about
it, the terms upon which the <HI>English</HI> shall be
admitted sharers in it, as well as the degree
measure and proportion of Interest in it, which
they shall be received into, may be Adjusted,
Defined and Stipulated.</P>
<P>Further it is not unworthy to be observed
that the <HI>French,</HI> as well as the <HI>Dutch,</HI> being
grown mighty in Naval Power, and both of
them, but especially the <HI>latter,</HI> the Rivals of
<HI>England,</HI> not only in Traffick and Commerce,
but with respect to the prescribing unto
others, what shall be the terms of Navigating
the Seas, and what Ceremonies of respect,
Ships of War, as well as of Trade, shall pay
to one another wheresoever they come to en∣counter
in Sailing; how that thereupon it is
become the true <HI>Interest</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> to have
<HI>Scotland</HI> advanced into such a state and condi∣tion,
as that it may be able to provide,
Equip and Maintain, good Squadrons of Men
of War. Which as it cannot be done with∣out
their attainment unto a considerable Fo∣reign
Trade; so they may be enabled speedi∣ly
to effect it, by means of their <HI>Colony</HI> at
<HI>Darien,</HI> provided they be supported in it. And
as <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon their being in a condition to
send out a Warlike Fleet of their own, will
in case of a War against Great <HI>Britain,</HI> save
<HI>England</HI> the trouble and charge of maintain∣ing
Men of War on the <HI>Coast</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> for
covering that Nation from Invasion, as it hath
several times both lately, and more Ancient∣ly
been forced to do; so it may with confi∣dence
be affirmed, that neither <HI>France</HI> nor <HI>Hol∣land</HI>
will be very forward to quarrel with <HI>England,</HI>


<PB N="177" REF="105"/>
when beside their own great Naval Power,
they will have a considerable <HI>Marine</HI> Strength
from <HI>Scotland,</HI> ready at all times to joyn and
assist them. And should it so fall out, that a
War is not with Honour and Safety to be a∣voided
between <HI>Great Britain</HI> and either of
those Nations, which is so far from being im∣possible,
that it lies within a probable view,
<HI>Scotland</HI> thro' having a potent Naval Power of
its own, will upon a conjunction in that case
of its Strength with <HI>England,</HI> give the King of
<HI>Great Britain</HI> such a Superiority over his Ene∣mies
in Number and Force of Ships, as may
in the ordinary course of Providence, render
him unquestionably victorious, which will re∣dound
chiefly to the Profit and Glory of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></P>
<P>Nor will they only in such case be in a con∣dition
both to protect their own Trade, and
to assist the English with a Squadron of Stout
Men of War towards the encreasing of the
Royal Navy; but they will by reason of the
Situation of their Country, and the conveni∣ency
of their Ports, be able to cover and de∣fend
the trading Ships of <HI>England</HI> to∣wards
the <HI>East,</HI> and to secure their Naviga∣tion
to <HI>Hamburgh, Swedeland, Denmark, Poland,
Muscow, Greenland,</HI> &amp;c. which is very needful
to be kept safe, because of the Pitch, Tarr,
Canvass, Timber, as well as of divers other
Commodities, which are brought from those
Parts, whereof several, if not most of them,
are indispensibly necessary for the building, re∣pairing,
and equipping of Ships of all sorts,
and cannot be so well had in other places.</P>
<P>

<PB N="178" REF="106"/>
Further, The more Rich and <HI>Opulent</HI> that the
<HI>Scots</HI> do grow, which they will speedily do,
by the <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Silver</HI> which will be dug out
of the Mines of <HI>Darien,</HI> and by the Profits
that will accrue from such other Productions,
as that Territory where they are so planted
doth afford, they will thereby be in the better
State and Condition for granting larger sup∣plies
to the Crown, than they hitherto could;
and thereupon administer ground, as well as
occasion, for greatly lessening and moderating
the Charge, which <HI>England,</HI> even in times of
Peace, but especially of War, hath heretofore
been necessitated unto.</P>
<P>And whereas the <HI>Scots</HI> have been at all times
able, and thereof given abundant proof du∣ring
the late War, to raise and muster great
Numbers of as brave and well-disciplin'd For∣ces,
as any Nation of the World can afford;
yet by reason of their Penury, which is a con∣sequence
and effect of their want of Foreign
Trade, and of Colonies in those parts of the
Earth, from which the great Wealth doth arise
and flow into European Countries, which their
Plantation at <HI>Darien</HI> will soon cure, remedy
and relieve them against, they could not grant
<HI>Taxes,</HI> nor advance <HI>Money</HI> that would have
been sufficient for the Maintaining and Paying
of their <HI>Troops,</HI> but there was a necessity of
putting them upon the <HI>English</HI> Establishment,
which was in part an occasion, both of those
excessive impositions of all kinds, which <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
became indispensibly oblig'd to fall into
the projection and enacting of; and of those
incredible Debts which it hath contracted, doth
lye under, and cannot speedily redeem it self


<PB N="179" REF="106"/>
from. For seeing the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI>
how plentifully soever it be furnish'd with Men,
and able to bring into the Field very numerous,
as well as admirable Forces, could not have
rais'd within it self that vast proportion of
Military Troops, which were thought needful
to be kept on foot during the late War, which
made it to receive and maintain so many thou∣sand
of <HI>Scots</HI> Forces; will it not therefore be
of great advantage upon any Stress or Exi∣gency
of the like Nature hereafter, to have
the same or a greater proportion of <HI>Scots</HI>
Forces to join them, and to come in to their
assistance, without <HI>England</HI>'s becoming oblig'd
either to subsist or to pay them? and instead
of having them upon Loan, and at a great ex∣pence
of <HI>English</HI> Treasure, to obtain them as
a <HI>Quota,</HI> which their Neighbours and Friends
will not only at all times be ready to grant
and advance, but to maintain at their own
charges. And as it may be affirm'd under all
the moral certainty imaginable, that the <HI>Scots</HI>
thro' their being upheld and defended in their
<HI>Calidonian Colony,</HI> will, in a few years, be ren∣der'd
able, and will be found ready and for∣ward
to come into those Measures of Con∣junction
and Union of Forces with <HI>England,</HI> in
all such Foreign Wars wherein they shall at
any time embark; so it may from thence be
inferr'd, that it is the true Interest of the <HI>Par∣liament</HI>
and <HI>People</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> to have the <HI>Scots</HI>
not only preserved and protected in the en∣joyment
of their Plantation in <HI>Darien,</HI> but to
give them all the countenance and aid which
they can, against such, whosoever they be,


<PB N="180" REF="107"/>
that shall attempt either the troubling of
them there, or the driving them from thence.</P>
<P>Moreover, it might be represented and
shew'd at large, how much it will be to the
advantage of <HI>England,</HI> both with respect to their
<HI>Plantations</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and their own
general growth and encrease in Trade, and the
rendring their whole Traffick and Commerce
more secure and profitable than it has been,
to have the <HI>Scots</HI> upheld in the possession which
they have obtain'd upon the foremention'd
<HI>American Isthmus,</HI> and that they be successful
and prosperous in the improvement and fur∣ther
extension of their <HI>Colony.</HI> But having said
enough in a former Paragraph, for the demon∣strating
of that beyond the being either de∣ny'd
or contradicted, and the matter being
obvious to all Men, who are capable of think∣ing
rationally and to any useful purposes, and
it being withal a Topick, which every little
and common Writer upon this Subject, will
not fail (thro' inability to enlarge and em∣ploy
their Conceptions about other things re∣lative
hereunto) to make their best and utmost
of; I shall therefore decline the re-assuming
the consideration of that Head again here, and
shall address to the representation of one <HI>Me∣dium</HI>
of Argumentation, whereby it will apo∣dictically
appear to be the Interest of <HI>England,</HI>
to have the <HI>Scots</HI> preserved and defended in their
Settlement at <HI>Darien.</HI></P>
<P>Namely, That the conveniency of that place
for an <HI>European</HI> Plantation, being now better
understood than it was before, and the won∣derful
Profits and Advantages that will flow
from and accrue by it, being more fully ap∣prehended


<PB N="181" REF="107"/>
and more clearly discerned, than e∣ver
they were; it will thereupon follow and
ensue, That should the <HI>Scots</HI> be drove from
thence, the Subjects of some other Prince or
State, besides the <HI>Spaniards</HI> will possess them∣selves
of it. Which whosoever it be, will be
of fatal consequence to <HI>England,</HI> as well as rui∣nous
to <HI>Scotland.</HI> Nor dare I entertain so un∣worthy
and dishonourable an Opinion of the
English Nation, nor shew my self so ungrate∣ful
to a Kingdom, unto which I owe more
Thankfulness, Service and Duty, than ever I
can be capable of paying, as once to imagine,
that they themselves will be so unjust, as well
as unkind, either clandestinely and by conni∣vance,
to be accessary to the wresting of that
Plantation out of the possession of the <HI>Scots;</HI>
or so ungentile as well as unfriendly, as sin∣gly
and alone, or in conjunction and confede∣racy
with others, to drive and compel them
from thence by force. Seeing as endeavours
and attempts of those kinds, would not only
appear so shamefully scandalous to all the sober,
wise and righteous part of Mankind, that the
greatest part of the World would reproach
them for the Treachery and Wickedness,
as well as for the Imprudence and Folly of it,
but it would beget that bitter and implaca∣ble
hatred in the <HI>Scots</HI> Nation against <HI>England,</HI>
as would excite and kindle those Desires and
Flames of Revenge, as no length of time will
ever allay, nor the Authority of any Prince
entit'led to both the Crowns, be able to ex∣tinguish
or to prevent the fatal consequen∣ces of.</P>
<P>

<PB N="182" REF="108"/>
And tho' the Power and Strength of <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
may be look'd upon with Derision and
Contempt, when compar'd with the Force and
Might of <HI>England;</HI> yet should first Wrath, and
then War arise between these two Nations,
it may be easily foretold, without pretending
to a Spirit of Prophecy, that it will be mis∣chievous
beyond expression to both, tho' in the
issue it may prove more ruinous to the one than
to the other. Nor is it possible to be avoided,
but that a quarrel rais'd between the King∣doms
upon that motive and account, will
produce the like, if not more dismal effects, than
the War in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> I.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> Buch. Hist. lib. 8.</NOTE> did, where∣of
a judicious <HI>Historian</HI> hath left this wise and
memorable Observation, that <HI>Angliam vehemen∣ter
concussit, &amp; Scotorum nomen fere delevit; It
wonderfully shook and weaken'd</HI> England, <HI>and al∣most
exterminated the very Name of the</HI> Scots.</P>
<P>And this is so obvious to be foreseen and
discern'd by any Man, that gives himself the
freedom of thinking, especially considering the
present circumstances of <HI>England,</HI> with respect
to its no less potent than envious Enemies a∣bout
it, as well as upon other accounts, which
I decline the mentioning of, that it will neither
be undecent, nor savour of undue boldness,
to say that whosoever shall advise the appli∣cation
of the power of <HI>England</HI> for driving
the <HI>Scots</HI> out of <HI>Darien,</HI> can design no less,
than either the ruine of the Nations by one
another, or the making them when divided
and weaken'd a prey unto those who long to
subdue and destroy both. But as <HI>England</HI> is a
Nation of more Honour and Justice, than from
their own inclination and choice, to come in∣to


<PB N="183" REF="108"/>
to such a design against the <HI>Scots;</HI> so they are
a more sagacious and wise People, than
either to consent unto, or to connive at their
being wheedled and drawn into it by o∣thers.</P>
<P>So that the <HI>Scots</HI> having no ground or rea∣son
for apprehensions and fears, that the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
will directly or indirectly concur and assist
to their being expell'd from thence, nor I hope
supinely and tamely look on until it be effe∣cted:
All the jealousie and dread is, that either
the <HI>French</HI> or the <HI>Dutch</HI> may co-operate and
contribute towards it; or at least that in case
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> alone should be in a condition
to accomplish it, thro' the <HI>Scots</HI> wanting, and
being refus'd sufficient and seasonable support,
one of these Nations, who are both so potent
in Land Forces and Fleets of War; should by
way of after game, make it their business to
get into possession of it. And under the power
of which of these two Nations soever it shall
chance to fall, it will be of equal, but of very
fatal consequence, even to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>For suppose that the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who are a Peo∣ple
that do extraordinarily well understand
their Interest, and who never miss the going
into all the Measures and Methods whereby
they may promote it; (witness their Conduct
and Management not many years ago at <HI>Ban∣tam,</HI>
and if we will believe a sort of ill-natur'd
Men among our selves, their coming there∣upon
into the late <HI>Revolution</HI> here in <HI>England,</HI>
not so much out of kindness either to our Re¦ligion
or Laws, as to prevent King <HI>James</HI>'s
revenging that action upon them,) I say sup∣pose
that they upon the <HI>Scots</HI> being ex∣pell'd


<PB N="184" REF="109"/>
from <HI>Darien,</HI> should find themselves able,
as undoubtedly they are willing, to settle a
<HI>Colony</HI> there, the consequences thereof towards
<HI>England</HI> are at present as obvious, as they will
hereafter be infallibly fatal and ruinous.</P>
<P>For besides the advantage that such a Plan∣tation
will give them, of engrossing and mo∣nopolizing
in a little time unto themselves the
whole Trade of the <HI>East-Indies, China,</HI> and
<HI>Japan,</HI> as well as most of the <HI>American Traffick,</HI>
especially that which is mainly profitable of
it: they will moreover by that addition of
Wealth to the Treasure, which they have al∣ready,
which the <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Silver Mines</HI> of <HI>Da∣rien</HI>
will inconceivably and speedily yeild them,
be not only in a condition to give Laws to all
<HI>Europe,</HI> and become the sole Arbiters of Af∣fairs
in these parts of the World, but they
will be able, if they have a mind to it, and
it is neither wise, nor will it be safe to lie at
their discretion, to rob <HI>England</HI> both of the
the Soveraignty of the Narrow-Seas, and of
the freedom of Navigation into any places
of the Baltick, the Mediterranean, or else∣where,
save as they shall be pleas'd to per∣mit
and licence them. But tho' this be a
Subject worthy to be enlarg'd upon, and that
deserveth to have an ample <HI>detale</HI> given of it,
and which withal it were not difficult to do
in a manner that might awaken <HI>England</HI> out
of its drousie and lethargical Temper, yet
for reasons which need not to be told, but may
readily be guess'd at, I shall not at this time,
nor in this place, prosecute it any fur∣ther.</P>
<P>

<PB N="185" REF="109"/>
However should the <HI>Dutch,</HI> upon Motives
which may lie before them, and whereof we
can have no information, decline interposing
in that affair, either as to the encouraging
of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to drive the <HI>Scots</HI> out of <HI>Darien,</HI>
or the endeavouring to establish a <HI>Colony</HI> there
themselves, in case they should be expell'd; yet
who knoweth but that the <HI>French</HI> may co-operate
towards the <HI>first</HI> in order to their
obtaining and compassing of the <HI>latter;</HI> which
will be as mischievous, if not much more, in
the effects and consequences of it to <HI>England,</HI>
than if it should fall under the power, and
come into the possession of the <HI>Hollanders.</HI>
And we have the more reason to be appre∣hensive,
that the <HI>French</HI> have some such design,
if we do but observe how jealous and impor∣tunate
they have been and still are in their
offers of assistance to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> for the
dislodging of the <HI>Scots;</HI> which every wise and
thinking Man must believe to be done in pro∣spect
of advantage to accrue unto <HI>themselves,</HI>
rather than of any benefit which they intend
shall result thereby to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> Nor do
I think it needful to give along deduction of
the mischiefs that may, and which in all pro∣bability
will ensue, upon the <HI>Settlement</HI> of a
Colony on the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien</HI> by the <HI>French,</HI>
to the affecting of all <HI>Europe,</HI> and particular∣ly
the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> they being so ob∣vious
that they cannot escape the views of any
who have Eyes to see, and will but vouchsafe
to open them. Nevertheless in order to the
awakening thoughts in such, who do not ex∣ercise
themselves in Speculations of this kind,
I shall very briefly intimate a few things,


<PB N="186" REF="110"/>
which carry their own evidence along with
them.</P>
<P>Namely, that should the <HI>French</HI> become pos∣sest
of any part of <HI>Darien,</HI> and especially of
that where the <HI>Scots</HI> have erected their <HI>Cali∣donian
Colony,</HI> they would thereby be wonder∣fully
enabled, both to disturb the <HI>Trade</HI> of
<HI>England</HI> in all their <HI>West-India</HI> Plantations, and
for making encroachments upon them, in their
best and most profitable <HI>Colonies.</HI> And if what
the Author of <HI>an Essay upon ways and means,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See Dis∣courses on the publick Revenues <HI>p.</HI> 116, 117.</NOTE>
doth say of the danger and damage that by
the <HI>French</HI> settling at <HI>Meschasipi,</HI> will arise to
<HI>England,</HI> with respect to their <HI>American</HI> Traf∣fick
and Plantations, deserveth serious conside∣ration,
as undoubtedly it doth; much more
is their establishing themselves upon the
<HI>Isthmus,</HI> to be for the same motives and
reasons seasonably thought of and prevented.</P>
<P>Moreover it may be very rationally affir∣med,
that were the <HI>French</HI> once possessed of
such a considerable <HI>Port</HI> in <HI>Darien</HI> as <HI>Port Acla</HI>
is, they would not long continue contented
with that, but would be endeavouring to en∣large
their Acquisition and Jurisdiction over
the whole <HI>Ishhmus,</HI> which as it would lay the
Foundation of their becoming Powerful o∣ver
the <HI>Northern Ocean,</HI> and afford them won∣derful
means and opportunities of extending
their <HI>Trade,</HI> to the <HI>East-Indies, China</HI> and <HI>Ja∣pan,</HI>
and of getting in a great measure to
be Masters of the rich and beneficial Commerce,
that is carried on and managed by <HI>Europeans</HI>
in those parts of the World; so it would
infallibly put them into a capacity and con∣dition,
of gaining in a very little time the


<PB N="187" REF="110"/>
Soveraignty both of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru.</HI> It be∣ing
both certain and evident beyond all deni∣al,
that with fewer than ten Thousand well
disciplined Troops, they may wrest both those
<HI>Empires</HI> from the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> as also
whatsoever they do Possess besides upon the
<HI>American Continent.</HI> Seeing as the apparent
weakness of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> there is such, that
they will not be able to withstand the Impres∣sion,
and attacks of a few Battallions of good
Military and Regular Forces;<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Gage</HI>'s new Sur∣vey of the <HI>West-In∣dies</HI> of the Edition 1699. <HI>p.</HI> 20.</NOTE> so it is Morally
certain, that they will have the aid and assi∣stance
of the <HI>Criolians</HI> (who are such as are
born in <HI>America</HI> of <HI>Spanish</HI> Parents) as well
as of those, who are of the race of the
old <HI>Native Indians,</HI> to rescue those Countries
and Provinces from under the Power and Do∣minion
of the Crown of <HI>Spain.</HI> Which how
fatal it would be to the <HI>European</HI> Princes and
States, as well as ruinous to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Mo∣narchy,
I need not be at the pains to represent
and prove.</P>
<P>Further should the <HI>French</HI> become once posses∣sed
of any part of <HI>Darien,</HI> and obtain the occupa∣tion
of the <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Silver Mines</HI> which are
there, it would after that be in vain to contest
or withstand their <HI>Pretension</HI> of succeeding to
the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> and of the Dominions
thereunto belonging. For as the <HI>House</HI> of
<HI>Bourbon,</HI> hath a great deal to alledge in Justi∣fication
of its Right and Title, of Succession
to that Monarchy, should his present Catho∣lick
Majesty die, without Issue, as he is like
to do, and as they have already powerful
Forces for the seconding and making good
their Claim, so it is beyond contradiction that


<PB N="188" REF="111"/>
were they once Masters of those <HI>Mines,</HI> which
lie within the <HI>District</HI> where the <HI>Scots</HI> have
their <HI>Calidonian Colony,</HI> it would after that be
impossible to defeat and prevent them in
their pretensions, seeing they would not on∣ly
thereby be in a condition to possess them∣selves
with ease of the many and Rich Pro∣vinces
which the <HI>Spanish</HI> Crown hath in <HI>Ame∣rica;</HI>
but they would be furnished with a
<HI>Fund</HI> of Treasure for the payment of all those
numerous Troops without burden to their
Subjects, which they shall think needful to
keep on foot in <HI>Europe,</HI> for the asserting of
their Right of succession to that Monarchy.
And I may Justly as well as boldly say, that
the single supporting of the <HI>Scots</HI> in their set∣tlement
at <HI>Darien,</HI> will be more subservient
and effectual for the obstructing of the <HI>French</HI>
in that design, than all the Alliances that
can be made in <HI>Europe</HI> against it, will in the
Issue and Event signifie, without the preserva∣tion
of that <HI>Colony.</HI> And indeed God in his
wise Providence, seems to have adjusted the
<HI>Scots</HI> settling there at this Juncture, in order
to be a means and expedient of obstructing
the <HI>French</HI> from succeeding in their pretension,
if others will have but eyes to see it, and
prudence to make use of it.</P>
<P>Finally it is not unworthy the being con∣sidered,
what Jealousies all Nations in this <HI>Eu∣ropean</HI>
part of the World have of late en∣tertained,
and what a general belief they have
imbibed, as if the <HI>French</HI> were aspiring after
an <HI>Vniversal Monarchy.</HI> And was not the fear
of this on the one hand, and the obviating it
on the t'other, the pretended reasons of the


<PB N="189" REF="111"/>
late Confederacy, and of the War that pro∣ved
so Bloody and Expensive, which tho' they
may be thought to have given some check
and interruption unto it, yet they are far
from having either made the <HI>French</HI> deposite
the thoughts of it, or from having so weakned
and disabled them, as to render the prosecution
and compassing thereof Impracticable. Yea I may
venture upon all the Topicks of Reason, and
Politicks, to pronounce that it is Impossible to hin∣der
and disappoint it, may they be but connived
at, in the obtaining the possession of the <HI>Gold</HI> and
<HI>Silver Mines,</HI> which lie in the Neighbourhood,
and within the District of the <HI>Calidonian Colo∣ny.</HI>
Whereas if the <HI>Scots</HI> be protected and
upheld in it, there will those Treasures flow
from thence into <HI>Britain,</HI> as will so enrich his
Majesties Exchequer, that he may not only
make his own Dominion the happiest and
most opulent in the World, and put the ba∣lance
of the Trade of the whole Universe in∣to
their hands; but render himself and his
Successors, the unquestionable Arbiters of all
affairs and transactions, within the limits of
the <HI>European</HI> Dominions, and give him the glo∣ry
of saving all <HI>Europe,</HI> from the Deluge and
Inundation of a <HI>French</HI> Conquest.</P>
<P>Whereunto let me in the next place be al∣low'd
to subjoin, that in case <HI>Scotland</HI> should
be able of it self to defend and maintain their
<HI>Colony</HI> against the machinations and assaults of
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> without the assistance and support
of <HI>England,</HI> as it is hoped they may, that the
<HI>English</HI> will not only lose the Honour and
Thanks of it, with all the Privileges and Ad∣vantages
which thro' countenancing and aiding


<PB N="190" REF="112"/>
of them they might have been partakers of,
as well as have been secur'd of the perpetual
Friendship of that Nation, and upon all occa∣sions
experienc'd the happy effects of it; so it
can give no just offence to such of the King∣dom
of <HI>England</HI> as are endow'd with Wis∣dom
and Understanding to have it plainly
laid before them, that if <HI>Scotland</HI> find it self
too weak to withstand the Forces of the <HI>Crown</HI>
of <HI>Spain,</HI> and of such as may joyn their Power
with that of the Catholick King for dislodg∣ing
of them, and in the mean time find them∣selves
abandon'd by <HI>England,</HI> how that in such
a case, it is greatly to be fear'd that they may
call in some Neighbouring <HI>Monarch</HI> or State
to their Succour and Support, tho' the doing
it will infallibly be reckon'd, and deservedly
too, a trespass against their Allegiance, Fealty
and Loyalty. And the <HI>Scots</HI> being naturally
a warm People, too much verifying the Pro∣verb,
that <HI>Scotorum ingenia sunt fervida,</HI> which
vulgarly goes of them, they may the sooner be
hurry'd into such an irregular and unlawful
course, by reflecting, that since both the Na∣tions
came under one Soveraign, they are both
much less esteemed by the <HI>English,</HI> and enjoy
fewer Privileges in <HI>England,</HI> than in times of
Peace between the Crowns they did before.
Whereof the reason is obvious; namely, that
<HI>England</HI> being the powerful and opulent Na∣tion,
and having the King Resident among
them, they do thereby the more easily influ∣ence
him to be kinder to them than to the
<HI>Scots.</HI> For tho' I hope that they will never be
tempted to run into such a Method, and do
also heartily wish, that no provocations may


<PB N="191" REF="112"/>
force them upon it, yet whosoever will either
consider, the Nature and Temper of Mankind,
and make reflections upon Late, as well as upon
more Ancient Precedents, may find matter of
apprehension and jealousie administred unto them,
that it is so far from being impossible they
should do so, that it rather looks like a moral
certainty, that it will come to pass. There
being nothing more natural, as well as usual,
than for Communities and Nations, as well as
for individual and particular Men, when
either unkindly treated by their Friends, or di∣stressed
by their Enemies, to seek for succour
and relief wheresoever they can obtain it. And
to cite the Testimonies and Examples that do
aver and confirm this, would be both to tran∣scribe
a considerable part of the Histories of
all Ages, and to give the Detale and Memoirs
of the behaviour of vast numbers of private
Persons. Nor doth it in such a case come
much under Peoples consideration how far such
a procedure will be accounted Criminal, and
the Authors of it held impeachable; Interest
in such circumstances out balancing Duty, and
present inconveniencies stifling Fears, with re∣spect
to what may be future. Nor is it un∣worthy
of remark what Mr. <HI>Littleton,</HI> Brother
to this present <HI>Speaker,</HI> broadly insinuates con∣cerning
<HI>Barbados,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See the <HI>Groans</HI> of the <HI>Plan∣tations.</HI></NOTE> when he, as well as that whole
<HI>Plantation,</HI> thought themselves severely dealt
with by the Government and Kingdom of <HI>Eng∣land;</HI>
namely, that it was to be dreaded, least
under such discouragements, they should be
tempted to run into Merthods, that would be
as irreconcilable to their Loyalty, as they would


<PB N="192" REF="113"/>
be contrary to their Inclinations, unless they
were forc'd upon them.</P>
<P>And as it is firmly to be believ'd, that the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> or any of the <HI>Northern Crowns,</HI> if ap∣ply'd
unto by the <HI>Scots,</HI> and their aid crav'd,
would be ready to own and espouse their con∣cern;
so it is to be apprehended and fear'd
in more special manner, least under such me∣lancholy
menacing and distressful circumstan∣ces,
they should not make their address unto,
and put themselves under the protection of
<HI>France.</HI> Seeing besides the agreeableness in
temper and humour, between the <HI>Scots</HI> and
the <HI>French,</HI> more than between any two Na∣tions
in <HI>Europe,</HI> the old <HI>Affinity</HI> that was be∣twixt
them, and the benefits which redoun∣ded
mutually to each of them by it, are not
wholly forgotten. For as the Ancient <HI>Alli∣ance</HI>
of <HI>Scotland</HI> with <HI>France,</HI> and the many brave
Troops wherewith upon all occasions they
supplyed the <HI>French,</HI> were the unhappy means
of the <HI>English</HI> losing all those Noble Provin∣ces,
and vast Territories, whereof they were
once rightfully possessed in <HI>France,</HI> so the <HI>Scots</HI>
are upon every unkind carriage of <HI>England</HI> to∣wards
them, but too apt to remember the
Honours and opulent Fortunes, which di∣vers
of them attained unto during their long
and faithful league with the <HI>French.</HI> Nor have
they reason much to question, but should they
renew their old <HI>Confederacy</HI> with <HI>France,</HI> and
call for assistance from thence, the whole <HI>King∣dom</HI>
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> would be soon reinstated there
in all the ancient Privileges and Immunities,
which were enjoyed by them heretofore, and
not only such who are chiefly concerned in


<PB N="193" REF="113"/>
the business of <HI>Darien,</HI> become liberally rewar∣ded
and recompenced for throwing themselves
into the arms of the <HI>French;</HI> but such as are
of the chief and first Rank of their Nobility,
would be courted to accept General-Commands,
Mareschal-Staffs, Ducal-Coronets, and Annual
Pensions, answerable to those of Princes of
the Blood, which their Ancestors formerly
had.</P>
<P>Nor ought it to be over-look'd, how the
<HI>Scots</HI> even since their <HI>Vnion</HI> with <HI>England</HI> un∣der
one and the same King, have without the
knowledge of His <HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty, sought
the <HI>Protection</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> when they conceiv'd
themselves in danger of being Invaded by <HI>Eng∣land.</HI>
It being too well known to admit of
contradiction, that when King <HI>Charles</HI> I. was
advised and influenc'd to make War upon
them, for their withstanding what they call'd
Invasion upon Church and State, how they ap∣ply'd
themselves unto <HI>France</HI> for assistance; in∣scribing
their Petition and <HI>Memorial</HI> to <HI>Lewis</HI>
XIII. <HI>Au Roy.</HI> For which, tho' they were charg'd
both with Treachery and Rebellion by the Court
Party, yet that Act of the <HI>Scots</HI> was not so
heinously resented by the <HI>English,</HI> as to deserve
to be taken notice of and upbraided at the
Treaty at <HI>Rippon.</HI> Nor will the Zeal, or ra∣ther
Biggotry of the present <HI>French</HI> King be
of much signification for diverting them from
begging his protection, in case they see them∣selves
likely to be ruin'd in their present de∣sign,
thro' their being assaulted by <HI>Spain</HI> and
abandon'd by <HI>England.</HI> As knowing that the
State Wisdom of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. will as much o∣ver-rule
his warmth for the Faith and Wor∣ship


<PB N="194" REF="114"/>
of the Romish Church, as it did that of
<HI>Henry</HI> II. of <HI>France,</HI> when the Protestants in
<HI>Scotland</HI> resisted such as they said would Persecute
them in the Reign of Queen <HI>Mary</HI> his Daugh∣ter-in-law.
That King being recorded to have
said upon that occasion, <HI>We must commit the
Souls of</HI> Scots-men <HI>to God, for we have diffi∣culty
enough to rule the Consciences of such as are</HI>
French. Neither ought it to be pass'd over
without observation, that the application which
the <HI>Scots</HI> under the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> I. made
to <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. was not very long after his ha∣ving
subdu'd his Subjects at <HI>Rochel,</HI> and wrested
the <HI>Cautionary Towns</HI> out of the hands of his
<HI>Reformed</HI> Subjects. Which open'd the way to
all the Mischief and Ruin that have overtaken
them since. Nevertheless this must be said in
favour of the <HI>Scots,</HI> that it was upon the Mo∣tive
of Religion, and from Indignation against
<HI>France,</HI> because of the late and present <HI>Perse∣cution</HI>
of the <HI>Protestants</HI> there, that they did
not carry their Resentments higher for the af∣front
put upon His Majesty, and the Parlia∣ment
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> with respect to their <HI>Act</HI> for
a <HI>Company to Trade in</HI> India <HI>and</HI> Africa, and
that they did not warmly express their dis∣pleasure
in relation to the interposure of His
Majesty's Envoy at the Courts of <HI>Lunenburgh,</HI>
and his <HI>Resident</HI> at <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> who by mena∣ces,
as well as by gentler Methods, both de∣ter'd
and discourag'd the <HI>Hamburghers</HI> from
contributing to their Stock and Capital, and
from joyning in the establishment and promotion
of the Plantation and Trade, which the <HI>Scots</HI>
were about to Settle and Embark in. For as
it would not but wonderfully surprize the <HI>Scots</HI>


<PB N="195" REF="114"/>
to find their Undertaking, and particularly
their transaction with the <HI>Hamburghers</HI> for
Subscriptions and Aid, not only stil'd <HI>The
Action of some private Men, who neither had Cre∣dentials,
nor were any other ways authorized by His
Majesty,</HI> when they stood warranted in the one
and t'other by the King's <HI>Charter,</HI> as well as
by an <HI>Act of Parliament,</HI> but to have it repre∣sented
to the Magistrates and Governors of
that Free City, <HI>That His Majesty would regard
all Proceedings with the</HI> Scots <HI>in that affair, as
an affront to his Royal Authority, and that he would
not fail to revenge himself of it;</HI> so it was mat∣ter
of the greatest astonishment to the People
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> that the said <HI>Envoy</HI> and <HI>Resident,</HI>
persevered to oppose them in all their trans∣actions
at <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> until they had frustrated
and defeated them in what they were about,
notwithstanding that <HI>Tullibarding</HI> and <HI>Ogilvis,</HI>
His Majesty's <HI>Two Scotch Secretaries,</HI> had declar'd
in a Letter to the <HI>Council general of the Company,
that they stood empower'd by the King to signifie unto
them,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See their <HI>Letter</HI> of <HI>August</HI> 2. 1697.</NOTE> <HI>that His Majesty would give order to the
said Envoy and Resident, not to make use of His
Majesty's Name and Authority for obstructing the</HI>
Scots <HI>Company in the prosecution of their Trade
with the Inhabitants of</HI> Hamburgh.</P>
<P>Nor ought it to give offence unto any, tho'
it may possibly alarm a great number of ju∣dicious
and thinking People, to have it repre∣sented
and publish'd, that all the opposition
made and given by His Majesty's said <HI>Envoy</HI>
and Resident to the <HI>Scots,</HI> transacting with the
<HI>Hamburghers,</HI> was previous and antecedent un∣to
any knowledge they had receiv'd, or could
possibly attain unto, of the Place, Territory,


<PB N="196" REF="115"/>
or Country, where the <HI>Scots</HI> had design'd to
Land, and to endeavour the establishment of
a Colony. For as none of the very <HI>Directors</HI>
of the <HI>Company</HI> had, until a long time after,
come to any fix'd Resolution where they should
attempt the beginning and carrying on a Plan∣tation;
so posteriorly to its having been a∣greed
upon and concerted by those few of them,
to whom the determination thereof was re∣ferr'd
by the rest, it was so secretly conceal'd
and kept faithfully undiscover'd, that neither
His <HI>Majesty,</HI> nor any of his <HI>Ministers,</HI> were in
the least made acquainted with it. And con∣sequently
that the foresaid <HI>Envoy</HI> and <HI>Resident,</HI>
being altogether ignorant in what part of the
World, the <HI>Company</HI> intended to seek and pur∣sue
a Foreign Settlement for Trade and Com∣merce;
and whether it might not be in some
Region or Province, that would be both agree∣able
to the humour of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and sub∣servient
to the Interest of <HI>England,</HI> their in∣terposing
so zealously and industriously with
the <HI>Hamburghers</HI> against the <HI>Scots,</HI> could nei∣ther
be upon motives of Love and Kindness
to the <HI>English,</HI> or of respect and deference
to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> but out of meer disaf∣fection
to the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and from an
aversion to the welfare and prosperity of that
People. So that it may be worth those Gen∣tlemens
recollecting, what heretofore befell
<HI>Archbishop Laud</HI> and the <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Strafford,</HI> for
having medled in <HI>Scots</HI> affairs beyond their
Posts, tho' with the Countenance and by the
Authority of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. Who notwith∣standing
their being Persons of incomparable
Talents, as well as of the most elevated Sta∣tions


<PB N="197" REF="115"/>
and illustrious Characters of any of the
Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> yet upon the arising of a
misunderstanding between that Prince and his
English Parliament, and thro' the necessity that
the <HI>latter</HI> stood in of having the favour of the
<HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> in the difference that sprung
up between them and their Soveraign, were
sacrific'd in order to appease and gratifie the
<HI>Scots,</HI> rather than for any treasonable Crimes
that they were guilty of.</P>
<P>I do foresee that it will be here objected,
that for the <HI>English</HI> to countenance and up∣hold
the <HI>Scots</HI> in what they have done, will
be to enter into a Conspiracy against them∣selves,
and a concurring in what will be high∣ly
prejudicial, not only to the Traffick of the
<HI>English American Plantations,</HI> but to the Trade
and Commerce of <HI>England</HI> it self. And that
not only by reason of the general <HI>Share</HI> in
<HI>Trade</HI> which the <HI>Scots</HI> by reason of that <HI>Cali∣donian
Company</HI> may speedily grow up unto;
but because of the great <HI>Immunities</HI> in Free∣dom
from <HI>Taxes, Customs,</HI> and all manner of
Impositions whatsoever, which are granted un∣to
their Company for 21 <HI>Years,</HI> while the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Traffick is by so many Laws and Statutes
clogg'd and over-loaded with them. To which
<HI>Exception</HI> I shall endeavour to give such a full
and sufficient <HI>Reply</HI> in the few following <HI>Refle∣ctions,</HI>
that I hope both the frivolousness and
indiscretion of it will be made obvious, and
render'd apparent to every Man, that hath but
judgment and temper enough to weigh things
in equal and just Scales.</P>
<P>

<PB N="198" REF="116"/>
The <HI>first</HI> thing therefore which I would of∣fer
to be consider'd is this, namely, That the
<HI>hazard</HI> of <HI>succeeding</HI> in the founding and esta∣blishing
of a New <HI>Colony</HI> is so <HI>great,</HI> and the
Treasure that must inevitably be expended in
order thereunto so large, before any considera∣ble
reimbursements can be hoped for, that it
is extremely difficult by any propos'd Immu∣nities
and Privileges whatsoever, to gain those
that have Money, and who know how to make
other improvements of it, to be forward, li∣beral,
and zealous of entring into and pro∣moting
such a Design. And if we will but
cast our Eye beyond Sea, and look at present
into <HI>Germany,</HI> and observe the encouragements
propos'd to the <HI>Vaudois,</HI> and the <HI>French Refugees,</HI>
in case they will settle in such and such pla∣ces,
where they are sure to be protected, and
at a season, when they neither know how to
be harbour'd, nor to subsist, any where else;
we shall not wonder that His <HI>Majesty,</HI> and the
<HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> thought the granting
of all those Privileges and Immunities needful
for the prevailing upon the Subjects of that
Kingdom, to engage in a design, the Scene
whereof lay so remote, and the Difficulties and
Charges would be so great and large towards
the bringing it to perfection. Yea, doth not
every <HI>Inheritor</HI> and <HI>Landlord</HI> in <HI>England</HI> allow
large favours and advantages, both to such as
will come and cultivate their waste Lands, and
to those who will lay out their Money in the
building Houses upon their Grounds where
there were no Dwellings before? And ought
it then to be complain'd of, that a Nation
in order to the extending the Empire and Do∣minion


<PB N="199" REF="116"/>
of their Soveraign, and the contributing
thereby to the enriching, in a little time, of all
his Kingdoms and Subjects, as well as his own
Exchequer, should have Immunities and Privi∣leges
granted unto them for a few years, and
whereof several were expir'd, before they actu∣ally
enter'd upon the execution of their De∣sign.</P>
<P>Whereunto may be added, that the advan∣tage
which will both accrue unto the <HI>Govern∣ment</HI>
at all times hereafter by an increase of
<HI>Customs,</HI> and an ability acquir'd unto <HI>Scotland,</HI>
of being more liberal in the <HI>Taxes,</HI> which they
shall grant unto His <HI>Britannick</HI> Majesty, than
heretofore their Poverty, notwithstanding their
Zeal for His Majesty's Service, would allow
them to be; and likewise the many benefits
which will arise to <HI>England,</HI> in the several
particulars whereof I have already given the
Detale, and which I shall not here repeat,
will abundantly compensate for the Immuni∣ties
and Privileges which are vouchsafed the
<HI>Scots</HI> Company for 21 <HI>Years,</HI> whereof Four are
already elapsed, wherein they have been at
great expences, without any return in way of
Principal or Interest. And it being the daily
practice of the <HI>English</HI> themselves, and indeed
of all Mankind, to venture upon Designs and
to run into Disbursements, where the gains are
too often only chimerical, and at most
times but merely conjectural, and very seldom
are morally certain; should the People of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
then, make it a matter of quarrel with
the <HI>Scots</HI> that they are embark'd in a design
without the <HI>English</HI> coming into any part of
the charge of it, from which if it do succeed,


<PB N="200" REF="117"/>
it is Mathematically demonstrable, that the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Nation will obtain great Glory, Power and
Wealth.</P>
<P>Moreover it is demonstrable, that the <HI>Be∣nefits</HI>
which will redound to the <HI>English</HI> in
the Interim, and within that circle of time,
will greatly overbalance any damages, or in∣conveniencies
that can be supposed to arise un∣to
them in their Traffick and Commerce, by
that short Indulgence granted unto the <HI>Scots,</HI>
of being free from Customs and Impositions in
relation to their exports unto, and Imports
from their Colony. Seeing besides the Emo∣luments
that will accrue to <HI>England,</HI> and to
their <HI>American</HI> Plantations, by the opening
unto them a vast Trade unto places where
they had none, or very little before, and by
that Necessity, as well as occasion, which the
<HI>Scots</HI> cannot avoid, of taking more off from
them both of their Natural and Artificial
productions, than they could formerly use, or
know how to dispose of them; I say besides
this, it is provided for, and ordained in the
very <HI>Act,</HI> by which their <HI>Company</HI> is established,
that their <HI>Colony</HI> shall be a free <HI>Port</HI> and <HI>Market,</HI> so
that the <HI>English</HI> may carry thither, whatso∣ever
they judge vendible either to the <HI>Scots,</HI>
or the <HI>Natives,</HI> for which they are like to be
paid in <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Silver,</HI> and they may also
Traffick there, and bring from thence what∣soever
is produced within the District, where
the <HI>Calidonian Colony</HI> lies, and in the <HI>Territories</HI>
occupied by the <HI>Indians,</HI> which are adjoining
unto it, all which will greatly Countervail and
and Outbalance, the few supposed inconveni∣encies,
that are discoursed by unthinking men,


<PB N="201" REF="117"/>
as likely to arise unto <HI>England,</HI> and their <HI>West-India</HI>
settlements, by the Immunities granted
to the <HI>Scots,</HI> for the short forementioned term
of years.</P>
<P>Further that as all the Commodities importa∣ble
by the Company which are not of the <HI>growth</HI>
of that Country, are all <HI>excepted</HI> from being
<HI>Custom</HI>-free, and are made liable to all legal Im∣positions;
so nothing of the very productions
of that place, can be imported by the <HI>Scots</HI> in∣to
<HI>England,</HI> but what they stand bound to pay
<HI>customs</HI> for, and are ready in compliance with
the Laws of <HI>England</HI> so to do. Yea the <HI>Navi∣gation
Acts</HI> made in <HI>England</HI> being still in force,
and never like to be repealed, and whereof the
conniving at the violation and breach, would be
of fatal consequence to the <HI>English</HI> in their Ship∣ing,
no goods can be imported from <HI>Darien</HI> di∣rectly
into <HI>England</HI> save in English Vessels, and
thither it is that most of the <HI>Dying</HI> Wood, as
well as of Divers other <HI>Commodities,</HI> which the
Directors of the Plantation can procure on the
<HI>Isthmus,</HI> must be immediately carryed and dis∣posed
of. So that from the whole which I
have laid down in way of reply to the forego∣ing
objection, it appears to be made without
any solid ground, and to proceed from people,
that neither have, nor can take a full survey of
this affair, nor look round it, rather than from
persons of any great penetration, or who are
conversant either in the Philosophy, or in the
praxis and Mechanism of Trade in the full com∣pass
and extent of it.</P>
<P>The only thing further that I imagine to be al∣ledgable
against the <HI>English</HI> giving countenance
and encouragement to the <HI>Scots</HI> in their present


<PB N="202" REF="118"/>
undertaking, and to hinder their Joyning in the
protection and defence of them, is that it may
prove <HI>prejudicial</HI> to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> thro'
the giving way unto, and concurring to pro∣mote
the settlement of the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Form
and Model in that part of the World; the
<HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> having found trouble and in∣conveniencies
enough from that <HI>Scheme</HI> of Ec∣clesiastical
Government in the <HI>Scots</HI> frame and
Edition of it, while it hath been confined with∣in
their own Kingdom.</P>
<P>This looks so much like <HI>Bantering</HI> instead of
<HI>Reasoning,</HI> that it may be construed for a reproach
put upon the Understandings and good Sence of
the greater part of mankind to vouchsafe an
answer unto it, especially in a Kingdom, as well
as an Age, wherein the <HI>Jus divinum</HI> of this
or that <HI>Form</HI> of Church Government, obtains a
very slender room in most mens Belief. And
it were well, if all those who are reckoned to
have the best natural and acquired parts, could
be brought to agree in the <HI>Essentials</HI> of Christia∣nity,
tho' they continued to differ in <HI>Disciplina∣ry</HI>
points. Yea it is to be feared, that the Dog∣maticalness
and the Intemperate zeal of some,
for things vastly removed from being <HI>Funda∣mentals</HI>
in our Religion, have rendred too many
persons <HI>Sceptical</HI> in the <HI>Material Articles</HI> of it.
And if we could better bear with one ano∣ther,
and agree to differ in Religious Matters
of less Importance, we might thereupon possi∣bly
better accord, and more second each others
endeavours in the defence of the Apostolical and
Athanasian <HI>Creeds.</HI></P>
<P>But how strangely are the <HI>Scots</HI> circumstan∣ced
and stated, with respect to their <HI>Darien</HI>


<PB N="203" REF="118"/>
Undertaking, when those of the Romish Com∣munion,
are alarmed at, and incensed against
it, upon the Foot, that it will be an Introdu∣cing
of the Reformed Religion into those
parts of <HI>America</HI> where it never was; and
at the same time, some <HI>Protestants</HI> are the
less favourable unto it, because it may be
attended with the Erection of a Form of Ec∣clesiastical
Government and Discipline there,
different from those of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England.</HI>
Whereas we should be thankful to God, that
the <HI>Reformed Religion</HI> is like to obtain some
footing where it never had any. And we
ought certainly to acknowledge and reckon,
that this will abundantly compensate for
the Inconvenience of Presbyteries going along
with it.</P>
<P>And how much sorry soever I am, that
there should be so much of what is properly
<HI>Popery</HI> spread among, and received by the
<HI>American Indians,</HI> within the <HI>Spanish</HI> Domini∣ons
and Provinces in the <HI>West-Indies;</HI> yet I
cannot but declare my Joy, that the <HI>Christian</HI>
Religion, how much soever Sophisticated and
Embased as well as Emasculated, with and by
Romish Errors and Superstitions, is neverthe∣less
come to be conveyed unto, and planted
among them in any Measure and Degree. See∣ing
tho' <HI>Popery</HI> can save no man, yet the <HI>Chri∣stianity</HI>
that is in the Papal Religion, (in that
the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> believeth whatsoever we
do believe) may be a means of saving every
man that is upright and sincere, and whose
Mistakes, Errors and Superstitions, are not
the Effects either of Wilfulness or of Negli∣gence,
but of insuperable Ignorance. Which as


<PB N="204" REF="119"/>
it doth at the least wonderfully extenuate
their Crimes and Guilt before God, and ren∣ders
them prepared and qualified Subjects for
the Divine Compassion, so it should awaken
Zeal in such as have love for Souls, and are
concerned to have the Kingdom of our Lord
<HI>JESVS</HI> Christ enlarged, both for the rectifying
the Judgments of those poor <HI>Indians,</HI> which
have been wofully misled in matters of the
Christian Faith and Worship by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
and for having the Gospel Preached in the
purity and simplicity of it, among those Na∣tive
<HI>Americans</HI> who knew Nothing of it. And
it is no small disgrace unto Protestant King∣doms,
States and Churches, that while they of
the Romish Church have shewed themselves
so forward and industrious, and have been at
such vast expences, to send and maintain <HI>Mis∣sioners</HI>
in those parts, and in <HI>Mahometan</HI> Coun∣tries,
for the publishing of the <HI>Christian Re∣ligion,</HI>
tho' wofully corrupted by superadded
Doctrines and Superstitions of their own; that
none of those stiled <HI>Reformed,</HI> have concerned
themselves therein to any purpose, save where
they have <HI>Plantations,</HI> that will without their
Aid, subsist and maintain Preachers, and these
also very poorly supplyed and provided with
pious and able Ministers.</P>
<P>And indeed one would wonder, that after
the <HI>Laws</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> for giving <HI>Liberty</HI> to
such there, as are <HI>Dissenters</HI> from the <HI>Diocesan</HI>
Jurisdiction, and from the <HI>Rites, Ceremonies</HI> and
<HI>Modes</HI> of <HI>Worship</HI> of the Episcopal Church, it should
raise Jealousie, Envy and Pique of and against the
<HI>Caledonian</HI> Colony, upon the motive that the
great body of the <HI>Planters,</HI> and the Governors


<PB N="205" REF="119"/>
and Directors of that settlement, will be of
the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> perswasion in those Extraessen∣tials
of Christianity. Whereas for my part,
were I a Zealot for the <HI>English</HI> Episcopacy
and Liturgy, neither of which in my opinion,
ought to give that offence to Wise, Learned
and Good men, which some pretending to all
those Characters, have conceived against them;
yet I should not be sorry, to see some of the bi∣gotted
<HI>Scots Presbyterians</HI> to transport themselves
thither, where I am sure they will do less
harm to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and may be to
Religion it self, than they have done, and still
are like to do nearer at hand. Tho' even
what they are in the very Neighbourhood able
to do, against the Diocesan Government, and
the Liturgical Worship, will not without a stock
of men of more Learning and discreeter Con∣duct,
than those men the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI>
is at present furnished with, signifie much to
the disparaging or supplanting of either, fur∣ther
than as Law and Force do interpose.
And against that <HI>Vltima Ratio Ecclesiae,</HI> as well
as <HI>Aulae</HI> I know no methods that can be law∣fully
run into, save those of Patience and Hu∣mility,
under Violence and Severity from them,
accompanied with Integrity and Moderation,
in the firmly keeping and modestly asserting
of Episcopal Principles.</P>
<P>Nor are the <HI>Scots</HI> at <HI>Caledonia</HI> like to be
so bigotted, narrow and peevish with refer∣rence
to the extraessentials and circumstanti∣als
of Religion, as they have been found in
<HI>Scotland;</HI> in that the Directors and Overseers
of that Plantation, have emitted a <HI>Decla∣ration,</HI>
wherein they grant <HI>Liberty</HI> of <HI>Con∣science</HI>


<PB N="206" REF="120"/>
to all that will come and settle among
them. Which as it plainly shews, that the
denying of it at home, is not upon the foot
of <HI>Conscience,</HI> seeing on that Foundation they
should allow it no where; but that the refu∣sing
it in <HI>Scotland,</HI> is upon the motive of <HI>Do∣mination,</HI>
and worldly Policie; so who knows,
but that this <HI>Precedent</HI> of theirs in <HI>America,</HI>
may prove a leading case to their being more
indulgent that way in <HI>Europe,</HI> than hitherto
they could be prevailed upon to be. And
that being no longer restrained by Principles,
which guide and over-rule Conscience from
granting <HI>Liberty</HI> to such as <HI>Dissent</HI> from them
in lesser matters of Religion; the Interest of
the Kingdom may in time oversway the pee∣vishness
of their Clergy. For tho' I do rea∣dily
acknowledge, that no <HI>Liberty</HI> upon what∣soever
pretence of Conscience, is to be gran∣ted
unto any, whose principles do not only
Authorize them to the disturbing and over∣turning
of Civil Governments; but do make
the Blaspheming God, and the ridiculing of all
revealed Religion venial, and the living brutishly
and sensually Lawful; yet in matters that are
purely Religious, wherein too much rigour
and severity have been commonly exerted, I
do take it to be our Duty to bear with, and
forbear one another in Love and Peace. For
I do really believe it to be one of the first
Truths dictated to us by Nature, that where∣upon
a person is to venture his Eternal
State, that therein he should be allowed
the liberty and freedom of choosing for him∣self</P>
<P>

<PB N="207" REF="120"/>
Finally this exception will prove the more
vain, as well as surprizing, if it be but ob∣served
that the <HI>Form</HI> of <HI>Church Government,</HI> and
the <HI>Modes</HI> of <HI>Christian Worship,</HI> even in some of
the <HI>English American Plantations,</HI> are no less
dissonant from, and may be of worse conse∣quence
to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> than what
the <HI>Scots</HI> are supposed resolved to set up, and
to be in the Practice of in their <HI>Colony</HI> at <HI>Da∣rien,</HI>
of which if I mistake not, <HI>New England</HI>
and <HI>Pensilvania,</HI> are undeniable Instances. In
that <HI>Independancy,</HI> which sufficiently strikes at
<HI>Episcopacy,</HI> and all the <HI>Ceremonies</HI> of <HI>Prelatical</HI>
worship, obtains as the legal Form of Govern∣ment,
Discipline and Worship in the first, and
<HI>Quakerism,</HI> which is a collection and system
of very dangerous errors, both in Doctrin,
Worship and Discipline, is the Christianity
that prevails, and is countenanced in the
latter.</P>
<P>Having now fully represented the whole,
that I Judge either needful, or convenient to
be said, not only for the Justification of the
<HI>Scots,</HI> with respect to their present Underta∣king,
and the Vindicating them therein, from
whatsoever with any shadow of reason
can be excepted against it; but towards the
clearing and demonstrating how subservient
their being Countenanced, Protected and As∣sisted
in it, will be to the Interest of <HI>England,</HI>
and the Dominions thereunto belonging, as
well as to <HI>Scotland;</HI> all that doth further re∣main
to be added, ere I put an end to this
discourse, is to acquit my self of a promise
made in one of the foregoing sheets. Name∣ly
that were I inclinable to recriminate, it


<PB N="208" REF="121"/>
were easy to fasten some of the worst of those
imputations upon the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whereof them∣selves
have been so hasty to accuse the <HI>Scots.</HI>
And that as the ways of <HI>Force,</HI> which they have
run into, do not correspond with the <HI>Alliances</HI>
between the Crowns of Great <HI>Britain</HI> and of
<HI>Spain;</HI> So that thro' having betaken themselves
to those methods, they have altogether acquit∣ed
and absolv'd his <HI>Majesty,</HI> from having that
amicable and friendly regard to the <HI>Memorial</HI>
presented unto him, in the name and by the
Authority of the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> that had they
persevered in the ways of mildness, might have
been expected from him. It being unquestio∣nable,
that upon their persevering in those mea∣sures,
his <HI>Majesty</HI> would have comply'd as far
with their desires, as either in Justice he should
have found himself obliged, or as his Royal care
for the Interest of his Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
or the trust reposed in him by that Nation (for
the discharge whereof he is sacredly and solemn∣ly
bound by <HI>Oath)</HI> would have allowed. Nor
can it be a trespass against that profound respect,
which is payable to every Crowned head, even
by such as are the Subjects of other Princes, to
intimate in Terms of Deference and Modesty,
that the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> thro' having betaken them∣selves
to <HI>ways</HI> of <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>violence</HI> against the
<HI>Scots,</HI> and that not only <HI>posteriorly,</HI> but <HI>antecedent∣ly,</HI>
to the presenting the <HI>Memorial,</HI> they have
transformed that into a <HI>Jest,</HI> if not an <HI>Affront,</HI>
which might otherwise have been interpreted
an <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>esteem</HI> and <HI>kindness</HI> for his <HI>Britannick</HI>
Majesty. For whereas the <HI>Memorial</HI> was not
delivered unto the <HI>King,</HI> until the 3d. of <HI>May,
1699</HI> they had above Seven weeks before that,


<PB N="209" REF="121"/>
not only detained such of the <HI>Scots</HI> Prisoners,
who by Storm and stress of weather had been
cast upon the <HI>Coast</HI> where they have their <HI>Colo∣nies</HI>
and Fortifications; but they had likewise
Invaded and assaulted the <HI>Scots,</HI> within their
own Territory and District, with an armed and
military Power.</P>
<P>By which, the Actings of the <HI>Spanish Gover∣nours</HI>
in <HI>America,</HI> are not only wholly incongru∣ous
and inconsistent; and altogether irreconcil∣able
with the proceeding of his <HI>Catholick</HI> Ma∣jesty'<HI>s
Ambassadour</HI> at <HI>London;</HI> but the Crown
of <HI>Spain</HI> is become apparently guilty of the
<HI>Infraction</HI> of the <HI>Alliances</HI> between his Majesty
of Great <HI>Britain,</HI> and that <HI>King:</HI> For where∣as
it is provided by the Third <HI>Article</HI> of the
<HI>Treaty</HI> 1667, and by the Fourteenth <HI>Article</HI>
of the <HI>Treaty 1670, That if any Injury shall
be done by either of the said Kings, or by the
Subjects of either of them, against the Articles of
those Alliances, or against common Right, there
shall not therefore be given Letters of Reprisal,
Marque, or Countermarque, by any of the Confe∣derates,
untill such time as Justice is followed in
the ordinary course of Law, and unless upon a
denial or an unreasonable delaying of Justice.</HI> Yet
not only while the case is depending, and
notwithstanding the assurance given by his <HI>Bri∣tannick</HI>
Majesty to the <HI>Catholick</HI> King. That
he will cause examine the Justice or Injustice
of this <HI>Fact</HI> of the <HI>Scots,</HI> and thereupon act
towards the Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> according to the
measures of Law and Equity, and the tenour
of his Alliances; but even previously to their
representation of that matter unto his Maje∣sty,


<PB N="210" REF="122"/>
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have actually fallen upon the
<HI>Scots,</HI> in the ways above mention'd. And
whereas it is Concerted and Stipulated by the
Tenth Article of the Treaty 1670, <HI>That if
the Ships which do belong to either of these Kings,
or the Subjects of either of them, shall by stress
of weather, or otherwise, be forced into the Ri∣vers,
Bays, Ports,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>belonging to the other in</HI>
America, <HI>that they shall be received kindly, and
treated with all Humanity and Friendship,</HI> Yet
nevertheless the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have in direct <HI>Vio∣lation</HI>
of that <HI>Article,</HI> apprehended and kept
such of the <HI>Scots Prisoners,</HI> as were forced
a Shoar at <HI>Carthagena</HI> by the Violence of a
Storm.</P>
<P>By which as they have plainly made them∣selves
guilty of an <HI>Infraction</HI> of <HI>Alliances</HI> be∣tween
the two Crowns; so they are become the
<HI>Aggressors</HI> in a War, which neither his Majesty
nor his <HI>Scots</HI> Subjects have given any Just cause for,
or provocation unto. And as they have thereby
rendred it Lawful for the King to oppose Force
against Force,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. Grot de Jur. Bell. &amp; Pac. lib. 1. cap. 1. &amp; Puf∣end. de jur. Nat &amp; Gent. lib. 8. ap. 6.</NOTE> it being received as a <HI>Theoreme</HI>
of what is Just and Right by all Nations,
that <HI>Iniquitas partis adversae, justa bella ingerit,</HI>
that the doing of wrong by one Party, gives
foundation of a righteous War on their side
against whom it is committed; and that of
all Wars they are the Justest, <HI>quae ulciscantur
injurias,</HI> which are undertaken for the avenging
of Injuries, so the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have made his
Majesty's entring into War against them (in
case they persevere in that Method) indispen∣sably
necessary, unless he should at once both
Sacrifice his own Glory and Honour, and aban∣don


<PB N="211" REF="122"/>
his people for a prey to such as are cause∣lessly
their Enemies. The great Duty of e∣very
supreme Ruler being to protect his sub∣jects,
from receiving of Injuries, or to revenge
them when done. And for this end it is, that
people becoming united into Societies, chose
and elected such and such to be their Sove∣raigns,
that they might as well defend as
govern them; and protect them against wrongs
from others, as well as take care for the
administring of Justice among themselves.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vbi sup. lib. 2 cap. 25.</NOTE> Yea
this every King oweth to his People, as they
are a part of himself <HI>pars Rectoris,</HI> as <HI>Grotius</HI>
expresseth it; He and they making one Poli∣tical
Body, whereof as he is the Head, so they
are the Limbs and Members.</P>
<P>And that the aggressed may at all times en∣deavour,
not only to defend themselves a∣gainst,
but that they may also Lawfully attack
the Aggressor, while he continueth to pursue
his Hostility, seems one of the first dictates
of the Law of Nature, being a sentiment
wherein all Mankind are agred: Yea it is the
only remedy and relief left by God, and a∣greed
upon by Nations, for the Obviating,
Withstanding and Punishing of those, who
upon the motives of Ambition, Covetousness,
or of any Lust else whatsoever, do seek to
Disturb and Injure others. (For as <HI>Puffendorf</HI>
says,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vbi sup. lib. 3. cap. 1. §. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Vanum fuisset praecepisse ne alter ladatur, si
ub de facto is laesus fuerit, damnum ipsi gratis
sit devorandum, &amp; qui laesit, fructu suae injuriae
secure, &amp; citra refusionem gaudere queat, It were
a vain thing to have prohibited the doing wrong
by one to another, if he who suffers the Injury,


<PB N="212" REF="123"/>
shall be obliged tamely and remidilesly to bear it,
and he who commits it, shall without reprisal made
upon, and reparation exacted of him, be allowed
in Quietness and Safety to enjoy the fruits of his
Violence and Rapine.</HI> Nor have the most civili∣zed
Nations, accounted any provocations what∣soever
to be a Juster cause, for their making
War,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Orat. ad Quirites.</NOTE> than their having Injuries done to their
people. <HI>Majores Nostri,</HI> says <HI>Cicero, saepe Merca∣toribus
&amp; Naviculariis injuriosius tractatis bella
gesserunt, Our Ancestors denounced and commenced
Wars, in case their Merchants, or their Mariners,
were wrongfully and abusively dealt</HI> with, which
he repeats again elsewhere,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Orat. 2. cont. Ver. 2.</NOTE> saying, <HI>Quot bella
Majores nostri susceperunt, quod cives Romani in∣juria
affecti, Navicularii retenti, Mercatores spo∣liati
dicerentur; how many Wars have our Fore∣fathers
undertaken and pursued, because of Ro∣man
Citizens being Injured, their Subjects</HI> made
Prisoners, and their Merchants pillaged.</P>
<P>But I hope as well as desire, that the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
will so far bethink and recollect them∣selves,
as not to prosecute a War against
those, that have neither wronged them, nor are
willing to be their Enemies, and that they
will not only forbear all further Hostility,
but make Satisfaction for any Injury they have
done. Towards the effecting whereof, little
more will be demanded, than the releasing
of those, whom they illegally and unrighte∣ously
detained as Prisoners, when thrown
upon their shoar by the Violence of a Storm;
and for the restoring of whom, they may
have also such of their own in exchange,
who became lawful Prisoners to the <HI>Scots;</HI>


<PB N="213" REF="123"/>
thro' being taken in actual Hostility, and in
the Field of Battle. And that the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
may be brought to calm thoughts, and to
a cool temper, it may not be amiss to offer
to their consideration, that the stakes for
which the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>they</HI> are about to quarrel,
are so far from being equal, that what the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> are ready to hazard, and going to
put upon the <HI>Dice</HI> of War, is vastly beyond
what the <HI>Scots</HI> can be exposed to the Risk
of. It being plain that the whole which they
are capable of losing is a little spot of ground
upon the <HI>Isthmus,</HI> and a few men; whereas
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> are about to venture no less
than all their Colonies there, and some of the
Richest Provinces which they have in <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI>
together with greater proportions of
men, whom they are not so over stocked
with, as to chuse to be prodigal in hazarding
them. And as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> ought seriously
to ponder, how uncertain the Issue of the
War may prove, so they cannot be igno∣rant,
if success should attend the <HI>Scots,</HI>
what they will rightfully thereupon become
entitled unto. It being settled as a rule
among all Nations, that in such a case,
<HI>Omnia bona quae Victus habuit victoris fieri,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. Grot. ubi sup. lib. 3. cap. 6.</NOTE> <HI>what∣soever

of those that subdued them and took it.</HI> But
this being a Subject that I have no call
