<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Liberty of De∣dications,
being the un∣doubted
Priviledge of
every Scribler, may save me
harmless in prefixing your
Name to the ensuing <HI>Re∣marks.</HI>
In which I do not so
much design your Patronage,
because I cannot fansie that
these Papers will be so much
taken notice of as to be que∣stion'd
<PB REF="3"/>
for their Faults. But
my whole Design on this oc∣casion
is to tell the <HI>World,</HI> how
much I love your Person, and
honour your Worth.</P>
<P>I will not be so vain as to en∣deavour
to represent you to
the <HI>World,</HI> or to your <HI>Self,</HI> for
you are sufficiently known to
<HI>both;</HI> and your excellent Parts
&amp; Integrity have not <HI>attracted</HI>
you more honor at <HI>home,</HI> then
they have <HI>acquired</HI> you <HI>a∣broad.</HI>
For I know your <HI>Re∣putation</HI>
is as happy in <HI>Fo∣reign
Countries</HI> for the even
<HI>Menage</HI> of Affairs, as in
your <HI>own.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>
But to attempt any thing
of your <HI>Panegyrick,</HI> were to
doe, what is done by all who
know you: &amp; therefore I may
justly divert my <HI>Pen</HI> to ex∣press
my <HI>Resentments,</HI> that I
can make no Present agree∣able
to <HI>your Merit</HI> or my <HI>Af∣fection.</HI>
For which, I have no
other Apology, but either my
Unhappiness, or that this is
not the Age, when <HI>Temples,
Altars,</HI> and <HI>Statues,</HI> are e∣rected
to Worth and Virtue.
Nevertheless, I cannot be so
fashionably modest, as altoge∣ther
to <HI>Vilifie</HI> my Offering,
or so far wrong you, as to ima∣gine
<PB REF="4"/>
it will be despised as utter∣ly
<HI>Ʋnprofitable;</HI> for it must
be a Present extreamly <HI>mean,</HI>
which so great an <HI>Ingenuity</HI> as
yours, will despise; and a Sub∣ject
strangely <HI>dry,</HI> from
whence so great a Discern∣ment
can gather Nothing.</P>
<P>I know, that little worthy a
Polite Judgement can be ga∣ther'd
from a Discourse of
People famous only for being
Barbarous; yet if Publick
Affairs can spare you minutes
enough to read over these
<HI>Remarks,</HI> you may perhaps
in them meet with so much
<HI>Order, Civility,</HI> and (accord∣ing
<PB REF="4"/>
to their way) <HI>Religion,</HI> as
may somewhat refine that
<HI>Name.</HI> However, if what
I tender may be by you recei∣ved,
as it is sincerely intended,
for an Unfeigned Testimony

I have accomplish'd my De∣sign,

<HEAD>THE
PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>IT being the manner of those who
Write, to acquaint the Reader
with the Design of the Book;
if I had any in Publishing this be∣sides
your Divertisement, it was
chiefly to make the <HI>Justice</HI> and
<HI>Religiousness</HI> of a People estee∣med
<HI>Barbarous, Rude,</HI> and <HI>Sa∣vage,</HI>
to reflect upon their Enor∣mities,
who would be reckon'd
for the only <HI>Illuminati</HI> of both.
And to shew that this <HI>Unlick'd,
<PB REF="6"/>
Uncultivated People</HI> agree with
the <HI>wisest Nati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s,</HI> in making the
care of <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Justice</HI> to
suppress <HI>Vice</HI> and encourage <HI>Virtue,</HI>
as the only method to make a State
happy.</P>
<P>It was one of the <HI>Pedantick</HI> Va∣nities
of the <HI>Grecians</HI> to repute all
<HI>Barbarous</HI> but themselves; and al∣beit
there are some who have the
same Opinion of every thing that is
diverse from the Manners and Cu∣stoms
of their own Country, yet those
who acknowledge <HI>Humanity</HI> in all
its Habits, may in perusing the Re∣marks
made upon these <HI>Barbarians,</HI>
meet with something that may <HI>civi∣lize</HI>
the <HI>Title,</HI> and induce them to
think, that what is commonly call'd
<PB REF="6"/>
<HI>Barbarous,</HI> is but a different Mode
of <HI>Civility.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Truth of what is writ∣ten,
I have us'd an Industry as
probable to ensure me thereof, as the
nature of the Subject would give me
leave. Having first travel'd the
Country, and remark'd as much as
such an occasion would afford, and
then retain'd a <HI>Conversation</HI> with
such Persons, both <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Jews,</HI>
as I found best able to encrease and
amend my first Remarks. So that
they are not barely the Occasionals of
a <HI>Journey,</HI> nor scrap'd up from <HI>Ca∣sual
Discourses,</HI> but the result of
some Years <HI>Inspection</HI> into the Peo∣ple
of whom I write; and that I
might not dis-ingeniously impose up∣on
<PB REF="7"/>
your Belief, I have not content∣ed
my self with a single Test, but
have rejected several Passages which
have not had a sufficient <HI>confirma∣tion.</HI>
It being not my intent to be
known for Writing things strange
and <HI>Romantick,</HI> but to be very
<HI>civil</HI> to the World, in putting no∣thing
upon them but what is Firm
and Solid.</P>
<P>As for the Dress wherein they ap∣pear
(though perhaps suitable enough
for the matter) I have been therein
so negligent as not greatly to regard
it, except in the Narrative to pre∣serve
<HI>coherence.</HI> For I conceived,
I was not to present you with the Cu∣stoms
of a Nation as <HI>I made them,</HI>
but as they were in <HI>themselves,</HI>
<PB REF="7"/>
which could scarcely be done, but by
exposing them (thus) <HI>naked.</HI></P>
<P>The Narrative of the late Re∣volutions,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> is that for which to
some I may seem the less accountable,
because I insinuate a want of Pub∣lick
Records among the Moors, out
of which it was to have been col∣lected.
But there was no such great
need of those Assistances in Penning
the Annals of our Age; and the
Narrative ascends no higher then
the Period of the <HI>Xeriffian</HI> Family,
and the Division of <HI>Kiram</HI>'s Ʋsur∣pation
of the Crown of <HI>Morocco,</HI>
which are very fresh in the minds of
the <HI>Moors.</HI> And yet for the clearer
Certainty herein, I have had the
assistance of some Ancient observing
<PB REF="8"/>
<HI>Moors,</HI> who were Actors in the
late Revolves. But my best help
I had, was from an Aged, Inquisi∣tive,
noting Person, an <HI>Hebrew
Sabio,</HI> one <HI>Joseph Messias,</HI> who
for many Years had been Secretary
of <HI>Tituan,</HI> and with great dili∣gence
had observed <HI>Memoirs</HI> of
what a long time had happened in
that part of <HI>Barbary.</HI> In what
concerns the War between <HI>Gaylan</HI>
and <HI>Taffilet,</HI> I confess I am not ve∣ry
particular, because much thereof
related to <HI>Tanger;</HI> but what is
here wanting, may be supplyed in
the modern Story of that Ancient
City.</P>
<P>How far I have been from Tran∣scribing
<HI>Leo Afer,</HI> which some may
<PB REF="8"/>
suspect, will easily appear by compa∣ring
what is contain'd in the Re∣marks
of <HI>West Barbary,</HI> with his
Description of <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>That I have not spoken more large∣ly
of their Colleges, needs no other
excuse, than that they now use none;
and the like may be answer'd for
my silence of their Libraries. And
how famous soever <HI>Mauritania Tin∣gitana</HI>
hath been in former Ages
for a Race of <HI>Literati,</HI> yet now there
is little hope to see a Restauration of
their Studies, if it be considered
what small regard the present <HI>Moors</HI>
bear to Learning: Which I under∣stood
from <HI>Cidi Abdella, Gaylan's</HI>
Secretary, a <HI>Spanish</HI> Renegado of a
bold Capacity; to whom, when I

<PB REF="9"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB REF="10"/>
was praising the Ancient Learning
of <HI>Fez, &amp;c.</HI> he told me, That now
the <HI>Moors</HI> were not very fond of
Bookish Inclinations, being gene∣rally
addicted either to Military or
Mechanick Employments: and when
I read to him out of <HI>Don Diego
Savedra Taxardo</HI> (in the 66th of
his <HI>Empressas Politicas)</HI> how that
a Learned Age might have as little
Valour as Devotion: That all know∣ledge
was superfluous which taught
the People more than to <HI>Obey, en∣dure
Travel,</HI> and <HI>Conquer:</HI> That
great Discursists were apt to intrigue
Affairs, dispute the Princes Resolu∣tions,
and stir up the People: That
it was the best Obedience, which was
rather Credulous then Inquisitive:
<PB REF="10"/>
That the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, so much
enrich'd with the Spoils, and ele∣vated
with the Trophies of many
Nations, reckon it among their
<HI>Happinesses,</HI> not to have their Con∣sultations
lime-twigg'd with Quirks
and Sophisms of Philosophical Per∣sons,
and make Illiterature one of
their chief Engines of Empire:
That the City may be taken, while
the Mathematician is delinea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>g
the Fortification: That Nations,
Provinces, Colonies, have grown
great by Industrious, and not Poring
Arts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> While I was thus reading
to the attentive discerning Renega∣do,
he broke out into a sort of Ex∣ultation,
and call'd <HI>Muley Mahu∣med</HI>
to witness, that he thought
<PB REF="11"/>
<HI>Savedra</HI> (the Author I read) was
a <HI>Moor,</HI> or otherwise he could never
have so punctually described the
<HI>Humour,</HI> and <HI>Sentiments of the</HI>
Moors <HI>concerning Learning:</HI> ad∣ding
withal, that if they who in their
present Illiterature were so prone to
Sedition, that they would be much
more so, if they were heated with
Bookish Speculations, and had their
Black humour chaf'd and quicken'd
with Subtilizing Studies.</P>
<P>The next thing which may seem
herein omitted, is, that which would
have best pleased the <HI>Virtuosi,</HI> an
account of their Libraries, for which
I was once sollicited by a Letter
from a Stranger, in the Year 1664.
who design'd an Ʋniversal Cata∣logue
<PB REF="11"/>
of Ancient and Modern Wri∣ters,
and their Books: And though
he possess'd me with great hopes of
finding great store of Books in <HI>Bar∣bary</HI>
for his purpose; yet upon En∣quiry,
I met with nothing but Dis∣appointment,
and that the <HI>Moors</HI>
are so far from having excellent Li∣braries,
that they wonder to see any
Book of Age or Volume in their
own Language. This I understood
from <HI>Cidi Hamet Cogez</HI> (former∣ly
<HI>Alcayd</HI> of <HI>Alcazàr)</HI> who when
in <HI>Tanger</HI> coming to see the Pub∣lick
Library that we had Founded
there, where I shewed him a MS.
in his own Character concerning
their Religion, he kiss'd, hugg'd,
laid it to his Brow, upon the Crown
<PB REF="12"/>
of his Head, lifted it up to Hea∣ven,
and in every Circumstance ap∣pear'd
therewith so much transport∣ed,
that I could scarce rescue it out
of his Embraces.</P>
<P>The same MS. I shewed to a <HI>Ta∣lib</HI>
(who was one of <HI>Tafilets</HI> Em∣hérkin,
or Messengers of State, sent
to Compliment His Excellency the
Lord Ambassador, The Illustrious
Lord <HI>H. Howard</HI> at <HI>Tanger)</HI> who
esteem'd it so great a Rarity, that
he sollicited the Ambassador to beg or
buy it for him at any Rate. This
Manuscript is now in the Possession of
the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> His
Grace. It is the first part of the
<HI>Mustadarif</HI> (or, as the <HI>Talib</HI> Ex∣pounded
it) The <HI>Clean Book.</HI> It
<PB REF="12"/>
was compos'd by <HI>Alfachì Mahumed
Ebn Ahmed Alchab,</HI> and Copyed
into that fair Letter, wherein it is
now extant, by <HI>Ali Ebn Abd'∣aliráhman
ebn Mahumed,</HI> a Native
of <HI>Suz,</HI> who finished it in the second
Moneth <HI>Giamadi, Anno Hegirae,</HI>
1005.</P>
<P>But these Stories have betray'd
me to an unintended length, for
which I hope to make some amends
in what follows; in which I have
endeavour'd, like a merciful Exe∣cutioner,
not to protract your Pain.</P>

<HEAD>A BRIEF NARRATION
Of the late Revolutions in the
KINGDOMES
of Fez and Morocco.</HEAD>
<P>THIS <HI>Narrative</HI> of the <HI>Revo∣lutions</HI>
of <HI>Barbary,</HI> shall not be
derived beyond the <HI>Annals</HI> of
our own <HI>Memory.</HI> For whose
clearer introduction, the contexture of
affaires invites us to step back to the
notorious <HI>change,</HI> which hapned about
the year 1508. Near which time the <HI>Ma∣rine
Familie</HI> approaching to its design'd
period and determination, it fortun'd
that a certain <HI>Alfachi,</HI> or <HI>Morish Priest,</HI>
in the Province of <HI>Dara,</HI> began to grow
into great reputation with the people,
by reason of his <HI>high pretentions</HI> to <HI>piety</HI>
and <HI>fervent zeal</HI> for their <HI>Law,</HI> illustra∣ted
by a stubborn rigidity of conversa∣tion
<PB N="2" REF="14"/>
and <HI>outward sanctity</HI> of life. <HI>His</HI> first
name was <HI>Mahumet Ben Amet;</HI> but pre∣tending
to be descended from their <HI>Pro∣phet,</HI>
he caused himself to be called
<HI>Zeriffe:</HI> A <HI>Title</HI> which the Kindred of
that <HI>Impostor</HI> have appropriated to them∣selves,
and made the <HI>character</HI> of that
whole <HI>Family.</HI> The credit of his preten∣ded
<HI>Pedegree,</HI> was another <HI>Engine</HI> where∣with
he insinuated himself into the peo∣ples
likeing, which together with his
seeming severity, made him of no vulgar
esteem with a generation, who from time
to time have been fooled with such <HI>Moun∣tebanks
in Religion.</HI></P>
<P>The great applause and approbation
his person met with from the <HI>Moores,</HI>
kindled in him no less an Ambition then
of making himself <HI>Lord</HI> of <HI>Mauritania
Tingitana;</HI> which must needs have proved
a very <HI>Hypocondriacal designe,</HI> had it not
been assisted with a favourable conjun∣cture
of affaires. For the <HI>Mauritanian
Princes</HI> had a long time weakned them∣selves
with <HI>civil discords;</HI> and the <HI>Por∣tugals</HI>
taking that advantageous occasion,
had farr advanced their <HI>Armes,</HI> and arri∣ved
at a considerable puissance in <HI>Barba∣ry,</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="14"/>
and were still under a daylie success
of new atchievements: Besides, the <HI>Moors</HI>
desirous of <HI>Novelties,</HI> and sensible of op∣pressions,
both from their own and for∣reign
<HI>powers,</HI> were sufficiently inclina∣ble
to adhere to any, who appeared with
probability to deliver them from their
present <HI>Yoke.</HI></P>
<P>This now <HI>Zeriffe,</HI> who wanted neither
<HI>Witt</HI> nor <HI>Ambition</HI> to conduct or enter∣prise
an innovation, found by the <HI>Starrs,</HI>
in whose <HI>Science</HI> his <HI>Legend</HI> makes him
very skilful, that the time was not yet
suitable for so great an <HI>undertaking.</HI> Re∣ligion
was his pretence, and nothing
could have been so fit beside to advance
him in the estimation of <HI>the many.</HI></P>
<P>To facilitate his designs, he sent his
three Sons, <HI>Abdel, Abnet,</HI> and <HI>Mahumet</HI> in
<HI>Pilgrimage</HI> to <HI>Mecha</HI> and <HI>Medina,</HI> to visit
and worship the Sepulchre of their <HI>Great
Prophet.</HI> Much was the reverence and re∣putation
of <HI>Holiness,</HI> which they there∣by
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>uired among the superstitious
<HI>people,</HI> who could hardly be kept from
kissing their garments, and adoreing them
as <HI>Saints.</HI> His admired sons failed not in
their <HI>parts,</HI> but acted as much Devotion,
<PB N="4" REF="15"/>
as high contemplative looks, deep sighes,
tragical gestures, and other passionate
<HI>Interjections</HI> of <HI>Holiness</HI> could express;
<HI>Alà, Alà</HI> was their doleful note, their su∣stenance
the peoples <HI>Almes.</HI> Their Fa∣ther
received them with content and joy,
and perceiving the favour and opinion of
the people toward him, to continue the
same as at the first, he resolved to make
use thereof, and thereupon sent <HI>Abnet</HI>
and <HI>Mahumet</HI> to the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Fez,</HI> where
they were kindly received by the too <HI>cre∣dulous
King,</HI> who made the elder, <HI>President</HI>
of the famous <HI>Colledge Amadorac,</HI> and the
younger, <HI>Tutor</HI> of his own Sons. <HI>Ad∣vanced</HI>
thus in favour at <HI>Court,</HI> and <HI>Grace</HI>
with the people, by the Councel of their
Father, they desired leave of the <HI>King</HI> to
display a <HI>Banner</HI> against the <HI>Christians;</HI>
induceing him to believe, that they would
easily draw the <HI>Portugal Moors</HI> to their
party; and by that means secure the
<HI>Provinces of Morocco. Muley Nazer</HI> the
Kings brother, resisted the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tion,
warning the <HI>King</HI> not to arme this name
of <HI>Sanctity,</HI> which being once <HI>Victo∣rious,</HI>
might grow <HI>insolent,</HI> and forget∣ful
of <HI>Duty</HI> in minding a Kingdome.
<PB N="5" REF="15"/>
He told him likewise that War makes men
awless, and that through <HI>popularity,</HI> ma∣ny
became ambitious and studious of <HI>In∣novation.</HI>
But the King intoxicated with
the Opinion of these <HI>Pilgrims Sanctity,</HI>
rejected his Brothers necessary cautions,
and gave them a <HI>Banner</HI> and <HI>Drum,</HI> with
<HI>Letters</HI> of <HI>Credence</HI> to the <HI>Princes</HI> and
<HI>Cities</HI> of <HI>Barbary,</HI> with twenty horse∣men
to attend them. Many Wonderful
successes awaited upon their <HI>actions,</HI> and
all things thrived so well under their
conduct, that at last the King of <HI>Fez,</HI> who
all along applauded his own Victories in
theirs, began to distast them. And seeing
they had poysoned the King of <HI>Morocco,</HI>
and made <HI>Amet Zeriff</HI> to be proclaimed
King in his stead, he mistrusted his own
safety, and began but too late to repent
his approveing of an <HI>armed hypocrisie.
Puft up</HI> with their <HI>successes</HI> they forgot
their <HI>obedience,</HI> and these <HI>Saints</HI> deny
the King the fifth part of their spoyles,
and only sent him six Horses and six Ca∣mels,
and those lean and ill shapen. The
<HI>King</HI> demands his dues, but they answer∣ed,
That seeing they were lawful succes∣sors
to <HI>Mahumet,</HI> they ought to pay no
<PB N="6" REF="16"/>
man <HI>Tribute,</HI> and that they had more right
in <HI>Affrica</HI> then himself; but if he would
respect them as his <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Allies,</HI>
they were not froward to embrace him
under that quality; but if he expected
any more at their hands, they doubted
not, but as they had had power to <HI>offend</HI>
the <HI>Christians,</HI> they should not be desti∣tute
in defending of themselves; By
which it appeared, that they took up
<HI>Armes,</HI> not out of <HI>Love</HI> to their <HI>Country</HI>
and zeale for their Religion, but out of
a desire of Rule.</P>
<P>The sword by both sides was chosen
to umpire the contest, which awarded
for the <HI>Zeriffs.</HI> For upon the encounter
of both the Armies, the <HI>Fessan</HI> Forces af∣ter
a long and doubtful Battle were de∣feated;
and the <HI>Zeriffs</HI> so well impro∣ved
the victory, that in few moons they
became the uncontrouled <HI>Lords</HI> of the
Kingdoms of <HI>Fez</HI> and <HI>Morocco,</HI> in whose
<HI>Government</HI> their <HI>Family</HI> continued a
considerable summe of years. But not
with out destructive <HI>Hostilities</HI> among
themselves; the Descendents pulling
down each other by the like treacheries,
that advanced their Ancestors: <HI>The grea∣ter
<PB N="7" REF="16"/>
thief stil leading the less to the Gallows.</HI>
Their Rebellions appeared under the
specious pretences of mending some
faults in Government, and one <HI>Cozin</HI> de∣posed
another, under the pleasing disguise
of setting up a gentler and more orderly
<HI>Dominion;</HI> forgetting that it is safer to
permit some inconveniences in the outer
buildings, then to pull the whole structure
down; There being corruptions which
may safelier be <HI>continued</HI> then <HI>removed.</HI></P>
<P>But notwithstanding these <HI>Civil Wars,</HI>
the power still remained in the same <HI>Fa∣milie,</HI>
and the dissention of the branches
proceeded not so farr as to cut down the
tree. And yet about the year 1607. the
<HI>Zeriffian House</HI> seem'd neer an extirpa∣tion
by reason of <HI>Boféres</HI> and <HI>Sidans</HI> op∣posing
<HI>Muley Sheck</HI> their elder Brother
in his succession. But <HI>Muley Sheck</HI> and
<HI>Boféres</HI> dying in the warrs, <HI>Morocco</HI> was
left to <HI>Abdalla</HI> son of <HI>Muley Sheck,</HI> who
scarce warm'd the throne, till he was vio∣lently
pull'd thence by his Uncle <HI>Sidan,</HI>
and by an unintended kindness freed
from the troubles of a <HI>Crown.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Muley Sidan</HI> once more joyned
<HI>Fez</HI> with <HI>Morocco,</HI> and in himself made
<PB N="8" REF="17"/>
the <HI>Zeriffian Family</HI> to reigne over both.
But he was much infested both by Land
and Sea. For <HI>Abdela</HI> a Religious <HI>Hermit,</HI>
and <HI>Hean,</HI> one of like hypocrisie and zeal,
two opposite <HI>factions</HI> distressed him at
Land, and the <HI>Pyrates</HI> of <HI>Salla</HI> and <HI>Al∣gier</HI>
by Sea. But his great valour main∣tain'd
him against both. For by his own
Arms he pacifyed the tumults at Land,
and by the assistance of the English
Shipping, he destroyed the Pyrats of <HI>Sal∣la,</HI>
which so much disquieted the <HI>Ocean.</HI>
And this being done he sent to have the
like aid against those of <HI>Algier</HI> the Pest
of the <HI>Mediterranean.</HI> The tenor of his
<HI>Heroick letter</HI> sent to King <HI>CHARLES</HI>
of <HI>Great Britain</HI> on this occasion, I have
here annexed, with no other designe then
to manifest the great esteem, which that

<HEAD>The Letter of the
KING of MOROCCO
To the
KING of ENGLAND.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1625.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>WHen these our Letters
shall be so happy as to
come to your Majesties sight, I wish
the Spirit of the Righteous God may
so direct your mind, that you may
joyfully embrace the Message I send;
presenting to you the means of exalt∣ing
the Majesty of God, and your own
reward amongst men. The Regal
power allotted to us makes us com∣mon
servants to our Creator; then of
those people whom we govern: so that
observing the duties we owe to God,
<PB N="10" REF="18"/>
we deliver blessings to the world; in
providing for the publicke good of
our States, we magnifie the honour
of God; like the Celestial Bodies,
which though they have much vene∣ration,
yet serve only to the benefit
of the world. It is the Excellencie of
our Office, to be Instruments where∣by
happiness is delivered to the Na∣tions.
Pardon me Sir, this is not to
instruct, for I know I speake to one
of a more cleer and quick sight then
my self; but I speak this, because
God hath pleased to grant me a hap∣py
victory over some part of those Re∣bellious
Pyrates, that have so long
molested the peaceful trade of Europe;
and hath presented further occasion
to root out the Generation of those,
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>
who have been so pernitious to the
good of our Nations: I mean, since
it hath pleased God to be so auspi∣cious
to our beginnings in the con∣quest
of Salla, that we might joyne
and proceed in hope of like success in
the War against <HI>Tunis, Algier,</HI> and
other places (Dens and Receptacles
for the inhumane villanies of those
who abhor Rule and Government.)
Herein whilest we interrupt the cor∣ruption
of malignant Spirits of the
world, we shal glorifie the great God,
and performe a duty that will shine
as glorious as the Sun and Moon,
which all the Earth may see and re∣verence:
a work that shall ascend
as sweet as the perfume of the preci∣ous
Odours, in the Nostrils of the
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
Lord. A work grateful and happy
unto men: a worke whose memory
shall be reverenced so long as there
be any that delight to heare the
Actions of Heroick and Magnani∣mous
Spirits; that shall last as long
as there be any remaining amongst
men, that love and honour the Piety
and Vertue of Noble minds. This
action I here willingly present to You,
whose Piety and Virtues equall the
Greatness of your Power: that We
who are Servants of the Great and
Mighty God, may Hand in Hand
Triumph in the Glory which this
Action presents unto us. Now because
the Islands which you Govern, have
been ever famous for the Ʋncon∣quered
strength of their Shipping, I
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>
have sent this my trusty Servant and
Ambassador to Know, whether in your
Princely Wisdome You shall think fit
to assist me with such Forces by Sea,
as shall be answerable to those I pro∣vide
by Land: which if You please
to grant, I doubt not but the Lord
of Hosts will protect and assist those
that fight in so glorious a Cause. Nor
ought You to think this strange, that
I, who much reverence the Peace and
accord of Nations, should exhort to a
Warr. Your great Prophet Christ
Jesus was the Lyon of the Tribe of
Judah, as well as the Lord and Gi∣ver
of Peace: which may signifie un∣to
You, that he which is a lover and
maintainer of Peace, must alwaies
appear with the terror of his sword,
<PB N="14" REF="20"/>
and wading through Seas of Blood,
must arrive at tranquillity. This
made JAMES your Father of
glorious memory, so happily renowned
amongst all Nations. It was the
Noble fame of your Princely Vertues,
which resounds to the utmost corners
of the Earth, that perswadeth me to
invite You to partake of that bles∣sing
wherein I boast my selfe most
happy. I wish God may heap the
riches of his Blessings on You, in∣crease
your happiness with your days,
and hereafter perpetuate the great∣ness
of your Name in all Ages.</P>

<P><PB N="15" REF="20"/>
The Traders into the <HI>Levant</HI> have rea∣son
to bewail, that the condition of his
Majesties affaires would not give him
leave to entertain this motion: which in
all probability can never be revived with
such promising circumstances, as it might
then have been enterprized; for those
Pyrats were then inconsiderable to what
they are now; for by the computation
of their encrease in Shipping and Skill in
Navigation, if not timely subdued, they in
short time may bid defiance to the Chri∣stian
in the Mid-land Seas. And albeit the
proposal was not embraced, yet it loud∣ly
spoke <HI>Sidan</HI> a Prince of Generous De∣signs,
and Noble Ambitions; and one
who aimed at the Advance and Security
of Trade, the Common interest of the
World.</P>
<P><HI>Muley Sidan</HI> having reduced the af∣fairs
of State to a great degree of Quiet,
he finish'd both Life and Reign at once,
contrary to the example of the most of
his Predecessors, whereof few either
Reigned to the natural length of their
Life, or were suffered to live beyond the
violent shortness of their Reigne. Upon
<PB N="16" REF="21"/>
his Death, <HI>Muley Abdelmeleck</HI> his eldest
Son, enter'd upon the fruition of his Fa∣thers
Atchievements. He was a person of
much flegm and indifferency, naturally
fitted for a tame and peaceable Empire,
into which he was happily inaugurated,
but not long continued, for in the se∣cond
year of his reigne he was unnatu∣rally
assasined by his second Brother
<HI>Luellud,</HI> whose ambition broke all
bonds of Nature and Politie to ascend a
Throne. But the infamous fratricide was
presently thrown from his usurped great∣ness:
for having by a powerful example
taught the nearest method to weare a
Crown, he was clandestinely Murder'd
by his youngest Brother <HI>Muley Hamet
Sheck,</HI> before he had accomplish'd the
period of twenty Months in his King∣dome.
And it is remarkable that <HI>Muley
Shek</HI> pretended to no vengeance of his
eldest Brothers death in that of his se∣cond;
but that he acted it only cut of an
itch to obtain the Government, seconded
with a suspition of his own safety; which
could not be great, while his Brother
might justly fear him as a Rival for the
Kingdome.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="21"/>
<HI>Muley Sheck</HI> being the last of the Bro∣thers,
and thereby without any to com∣petition
him, he studied to make both
his Government and Person gratious to
the people. In which artifice he was so
prosperous, that no Sultan in <HI>Barbary</HI>
had equal'd him in a confluence of hap∣piness.
The Skie of his Reigne was for
nineteen years serene: and there were
no prognosticks of alteration in his con∣dition,
till <HI>Laella,</HI> one of his Wives,
began to be exorbitant in her appetites,
and to meditate disloyalty to her Hus∣band's
Bed. She is reported to have been
a woman of a refined subtilty, and learn∣ed
in the most artful methods of steale∣ing
her pleasures. But at length she fell
excessively enamour'd of her own kins∣man,
one <HI>Cidi Kirum,</HI> whom the King
had adopted into his <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Conver∣sation.</HI>
This <HI>Kirum</HI> was of a popular in∣clination,
and skilful in feeding the hu∣mours
of the people. He had been at
<HI>Mecha</HI> in Devotion, and of course recei∣ved
for that <HI>visitation</HI> the title of <HI>Hadge,</HI>
granted to all that have performed the
<HI>Hage,</HI> or Pilgrimage to their Prophets
Tomb. By this, and a great shew of ex∣terior
<PB N="18" REF="22"/>
Religion, he had with men of all
capacities purchased a significant repu∣tation.
And albeit he was a wel-wisher
to an Innovation, the common designe
of their pretended Piety, yet the present
face of affaires look'd very disagreeable
upon such an enterprise. For the King
so rul'd, that all had cause to love, and
none to feare him, and the courteousness
of his personal behaviour, had secured
him a large share in the worst of his Sub∣jects
bosoms; His custom being to punish
and spare none, who were convict offen∣dors
against their Law, the known Rule
both of their Religion and Politie. And
for the greater discouragement of
all commotions, the <HI>Zeriffian</HI> name
was grown sacred with the Moors,
through its long continuance: and they
concluded its prosperity a Divine ap∣probation
of its Right.</P>
<P><HI>Kirum</HI> no doubt was still as coveteous
to enjoy the Crown, as <HI>Laella</HI> his Bed;
whose amours at last grew to that height
of impatience, that nothing could quiet
them, but the embraces of her Paramour
in a Regal State; which she plotted
with a feminine invention. The death of
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
the King her Husband was the only se∣cure
<HI>Recipe</HI> for her distemper, but alto∣gether
of an unsafe accomplishment, if
enterprised by open violence. Where∣fore
she is reported to have essayed his
Death by Sorcery's; in which wickedness
(Story tels us) that the Mahumetan Wo∣men
have alwaies been dexterous. But
not precisely to determine, by what way
<HI>Muley Hamet Sheck</HI> came to his Grave,
it is certain that his end was suddain
and unexpected, and that he shut up his
life before he had seen the twentieth
yeare of his Reign. His decease was
much lamented, and the more because it
came unsuspected. The Government
lineally descended upon his Son <HI>Muley
Labèsh,</HI> a child of three years old, whom
his dying Father bequeath'd to the pro∣tection
of <HI>Kirum El Hadge,</HI> and other
Grandees of the Kingdome, appointing
them to administer the affaires of State
in <HI>Labèsh</HI>'s name, till he was come to
the age of eleven years. In which time
<HI>Kirum</HI> was so balanc'd with his fellow
Regents, that he durst not attempt the
least alteration. But such was the crafty
conduct of his demeanor, that he had
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
made many of the <HI>Almocadens</HI> among the
<HI>Alàrbs</HI> to be his <HI>creatures</HI> and ready at
his Devotion, and of whose assistance
he might rely, when he saw it convenient
to time a Revolution: which he deferr'd
to the entrance of the second yeare of
<HI>Labèsh's</HI> reigne, being the thirteenth of
his age. At which time <HI>Kirum</HI> secretly
retired from Court, and was not heard
of, till he appear'd in the head of a nu∣merous
Army of <HI>Alàrbs,</HI> whom he had al∣lured
into Rebellion with the promises
of large Incoms, the baite disloyalty still
leaps at.</P>
<P><HI>Labèsh</HI> quickly took the Alarm, and
with considerable Forces marcht toward
<HI>Kirum,</HI> if possible to end the Warr in the
place where it was begun. The Moors
highly extol the valour and conduct of
this young King, who forgetting the de∣lights
and toys of that age, devoted him∣self
to the severities of Military Disci∣pline,
constantly watching in the Camp,
or courageously fighting in the Battel.
For four years His fortunes and <HI>Kirum</HI>'s
had their vicissitudes, for so long they
fought with dubious presages of the
event; till Treachery at last is said to have
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
given <HI>Kirum</HI> that conquest which cou∣rage
could not; for <HI>Labèsh</HI> being invited
by <HI>Kirum</HI> to receive his Recantation,
met with a Barbarous death, where he
hoped to receive a Loyal subjection.
Others report that <HI>Kirum</HI> slew him with
his own hands in that fatal Battel, which
proved the finishing overthrow.</P>
<P>After the death of <HI>Labèsh, Kirum</HI> be∣came
too powerful for the resistance of
his scattered Forces, haveing none left
under whose conduct they might venture
their last Efforts; so that now all oppo∣sitions
being removed with the King,
<HI>Kirum</HI> made a quiet march to <HI>Morocco,</HI>
where the Citizens received him with
all the significations of subjection, in
whose imitation the adjoyning <HI>Cavílas</HI>
brought in the pledges of their Allegi∣ance
to <HI>Kirum:</HI> which they did not in∣termit,
till by a natural death he resign'd
the Kingdom to his Son <HI>Muley Boucar,</HI>
who after the short reigne of three
months was dethron'd by <HI>Taffalete,</HI> of
which Revolution more will be said in
the story of that prevailing <HI>Zeriff.</HI></P>
<P>The Moors having for a long season
been torn and distracted with the unna∣tural
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
Murders of <HI>Sidans</HI> Sons, and wea∣ried
out with following those Wars,
which had no juster causes then private
interests and envious Annimosities, be∣gan
at last to provide for their own peace
and safety. The adored <HI>Zeriffian</HI> Fami∣ly
was extinct in <HI>Labèsh,</HI> whereby they
were quitted from obedience to that
Race. <HI>Kirum</HI> by several of the <HI>great ones</HI>
living distant from the Court, was look∣ed
upon as one, both by unjustness of
title, and meanness of Pedegree, unfit to
receive their Allegiance. In this shaken
and doubtful State of affairs, some stood
neuter in their judgements, but outward∣ly
complyed with the present Govern∣ment;
others resolved to stand upon
their Guard, chooseing rather to run the
hazards of War, then to enjoy the safety
of a dishonourable Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Cidi Hamet-Ali-Haiáshi, Cidi Mahu∣met
Ben-el Hadge-Ben-Boucar,</HI> and the
<HI>Zeriff</HI> of <HI>Benzaruel</HI> were the <HI>Chiefs</HI> in
these new commotions, but all opposite
factions, and all <HI>Alarbs,</HI> and all great
Saints: The last of the three contented
himself with the protection of <HI>Ben Zaru∣el,</HI>
a large Cavíla almost impregnable
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
by nature, in whose Government his An∣cestors
for many years had lived in
peace. But after two months of stout re∣sistance
was subdued by <HI>Tafilete;</HI> who
took with him the Aged <HI>Zeriff,</HI> and di∣spersed
his Family, of which there per∣haps
will be an opportunity of speaking
more in another paragraph.</P>
<P><HI>Haiáshi</HI> and <HI>Ben-Boucar,</HI> gifted with
greater ambitions, laboured to enlarge
the Curtains of their Territories, and
each seem'd to aime at no less then
the Empire of Mauritania Tingitana.
Their outward Sanctimony equald them
in the peoples affection and esteem, and if
they could have reconciled their Inter∣ests,
and joyned in the same designe, they
had shared that state, which both lost,
while each would have all or none: of
whose rise and fall these succeeding pe∣riods
will give you information.</P>
<P><HI>Cidi Hamet Ali Haiáshi</HI> was an <HI>Alarb,</HI>
(or one of that sort of <HI>Moors,</HI> who live un∣der
Tents and in Mountains, without any
fixed habitations, as I shall shew in my
notices upon this Country,) who had the
learning of a <HI>Talib,</HI> and sanctity of a <HI>Ma∣rabout;</HI>
by which he was esteemed as an
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
Oracle among his Countrymen, who up∣on
all Emergent occasions repaired unto
him for advice and Instruction; which
they received as Infallible, and obey'd
as a Law. His Parentage according to
the <HI>Moresco Heraldry</HI> was not obscure;
for the Government of <HI>Abenimálec</HI> was
Hereditary to his Family, and legally
descended to his possession. Which <HI>Abeni∣málec</HI>
being a very large Cavíla, upon the
river of <HI>Mamora,</HI> was by <HI>Haiashi</HI> gover∣ned
with that politick carriage, which
made him reverenced of his own people,
and fear'd of his neighbours, as appear'd
in their ready abetting his enterpri∣ses.</P>
<P>The late suspected death of <HI>Muley
Sheck,</HI> together with the violent murther,
and dethroning of his Son, both <HI>Haiashi's</HI>
beloved Soveraigns, made <HI>Kirum,</HI> whom
he supposed to have been as well the se∣cret
contriver of the first, as he saw him
the open acter of the second villany, to
be odious to his thoughts, and unfit for
his obedience. Revenge, whose lawful∣ness
is an Article in the Moors Creed,
put <HI>Haiashi</HI> into Arms, with intent, if
not to depose <HI>Kirum</HI> from being King,
<PB N="25" REF="25"/>
yet at least keep himself from becoming
his Subject. His first Musters consisted
ownly of the Levies of his own <HI>Cavíla,</HI>
to which were daily accessions of the
Neighboring <HI>Almócadens,</HI> which helpt
to adjust his Insurrection. His Forces
being soon increased above his hopes,
he order'd his March toward <HI>Fez,</HI> the
Metropolis of the Kingdom of that name.
This ancient City was now govern'd by
<HI>Ʋbahà, Kirums</HI> Creature; who upon
the advance of <HI>Haiáshi</HI>'s Forces, secret∣ly
stole away to <HI>Morocco,</HI> as not daring
to trust himself to his own valour, or
the fidelity of the Citizens. By the
flight of <HI>Ʋbahà, Fez</HI> being left Gover∣norless,
it became the easie Atchievement
of <HI>Haiáshi;</HI> under whose Command it
continued seven Years, and was a fair
addition to his Greatness and Safety,
being (as was said) the Metropolis of the
Kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>Haiáshi</HI> by his Successes began to be
the envy of <HI>Ben-Boucar,</HI> who for some
Years after his Revolt from <HI>Morocco,</HI> con∣tented
himself with the solitary Domi∣nion
of <HI>Záwia,</HI> where he lived in a
House of that name, which for its Reli∣gious
<PB N="26" REF="26"/>
Foundation, was become a Sanctu∣ary,
or Refuge for Offenders. The In∣habitants
of <HI>Záwia</HI> are reported to be
very numerous and Warlike, yet by rea∣son
of remoteness, they created <HI>Haiáshi</HI>
very small Disturbances; besides, <HI>Ben-Boucar</HI>
was unwilling to refer himself
to the uncertain Decision of the Sword,
which, in all probability, must have gi∣ven
the Victory to <HI>Haiáshi,</HI> by whose
Forces he was far exceeded. He there∣fore
betook himself to Stratagem, and
consults with <HI>Ali Ben Hamet, Almocaden</HI> of
<HI>Saphían,</HI> one whom <HI>Haiáshi</HI> had not yet
entirely subdued, by what method their
common Enemy might be removed. Now
the <HI>Moors,</HI> in removal of those they hate,
seem to know no other Policies, besides
an armed Violence, and secret Massacre.
The two Conspirators saw their inabili∣ty
to undertake the former, and there∣fore
resolved to put the latter in execu∣tion.</P>
<P><HI>Ali Ben Hamet</HI> greedy of that sweet
bit Revenge, and to express it upon <HI>Hai∣áshi,</HI>
who had dispoiled him of his Right,
uudertook to be his Assasinate: which
he thus effected. <HI>Haiáshi</HI> being lodged
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
in his Tent near <HI>Azount,</HI> a Fountain he
greatly esteemed in the <HI>Cavíla</HI> of <HI>Atcleik,</HI>
about six Leagues North of <HI>Alcazàr,</HI> was
in the Night visited by <HI>Ali,</HI> accompany∣ed
with about 70 Horse, who came not
with any shew of Hostility, but with a
pretence of Friendship, declaring, That
his Errand was design'd to render him∣self
<HI>Haiáshies</HI> Subject, and to receive the
continuance of his <HI>Cavíla</HI> from his hand.
Under this Cloak <HI>Haiáshi</HI> received him
into his Tent, and thereby gave him the
opportunity of Murthering him, which
he effected with one Stab. The Mur∣therer
had his Accomplices ready to
make his Escape, which was the less dif∣ficult,
because <HI>Haiáshi</HI> had no Guards,
which he had declined either to save
Charges, or dissemble his confidence
in <HI>the Moors, who are best made faithful
by being trusted; but very vindictive,
when they find themselves suspected.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ben-Boucar</HI> being ascertain'd by <HI>Ali</HI>
of <HI>Haiáshies</HI> treacherous Slaughter, in
the Twelfth Year of his Revolt, he in∣cèssantly
marcht to take Possession of his
Country, which he found ready at his
Devotion; either because the People
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
were unprovided for Opposition; or,
that they thought <HI>Ben-Boucar</HI>'s Superi∣ority
was less obnoxious to exception,
then any other they could elect. The
<HI>Almócadens,</HI> mindful of their accustom∣ed
method to preserve their Commands,
secretly one after another subscribed to
<HI>Ben-Boucar</HI>'s Regiment; onely <HI>Fez</HI> and
<HI>Alcazàr</HI> cost him some time and Blood in
their Reduction. But at last they yield∣ed
upon Articles, <HI>Arzila</HI> having first
shown them the way. <HI>Ben-Boucar</HI>'s next
March was to <HI>Tituan,</HI> govern'd by the
Ancient and Worthy Family of the <HI>Nar∣sis,</HI>
out of which he had received a Wife,
and by that Relation was welcome to the
Supremacie of that City.</P>
<P><HI>Ben-Boucar</HI> having brought this part
of <HI>Barbary</HI> to his subjection, resolved
to return to <HI>Záwia:</HI> But before he left
the Country, he took from the Grandees
thereof, the best Assurances he was able
for their Obedience and Fidelity. Next,
he disposed the Towns of greatest Im∣portance,
to the Government of his Sons
and Favorites. To his eldest Son <HI>Abdal∣la</HI>
he entrusted the Rule of <HI>Salla,</HI> which
he had observed proner to Sedition then
<PB N="29" REF="27"/>
the rest, and yet much addicted to Per∣sons
famed for Piety, for which <HI>Abdalla</HI>
was arrived at a Saintship. To his se∣cond
Son <HI>Mahumed,</HI> he committed the
care of <HI>Fez,</HI> to whom he saw the People
thereof have a peculiar Inclination. To
his third Son <HI>Hamet Zéer,</HI> or <HI>Hamet the
less,</HI> he gave the command of <HI>Shehàll,</HI> a
Mountain of rude Inhabitants, yet much
addicted to obey a fierce nature, where∣with
<HI>Hamet Zéer</HI> was furnished. <HI>Arzila</HI>
he left to <HI>Benzèir, a Thing of his own
framing:</HI> And <HI>Alcazar</HI> to <HI>Cidi Benzían.</HI>
After this Partition, he returned to his
Religious <HI>Záwia,</HI> where in great Peace
he enjoyed the fruits of his War, making
the easiness of his Yoak an argument
with the People to bear it.</P>
<P>But the memory of <HI>Haiáshi</HI>'s trea∣cherous
Death (compassed by <HI>Ben-Bou∣car)</HI>
was still fresh in the Brests of those
Sons, whose Fathers had their Fortunes
thereby depress'd; which <HI>Ben-Boucar,</HI>
as he could not but know, so he could
not but conclude, <HI>That the vindictive
Spirit of a</HI> Moor <HI>would take the first oc∣casion
of avenging.</HI> In prevention where∣of,
he took with him to <HI>Záwia</HI> such Sons
<PB N="30" REF="28"/>
as he saw were likeliest to inherit their
Fathers hatred against him; not as Ho∣stages
of Peace, but as Pledges of his
Care, whom being as yet in their non-age,
he loved to Print with the Chara∣cters
of a peaceable acquiescence in his
Authority. Among these Youths, young
<HI>Gaylan</HI> was most considerable, and in∣deed
the only Person that he detained:
whose Story now succeeds, in which will
be supplyed what is here wanting of <HI>Ben-Boucar.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Beniworfut,</HI> near to <HI>Arzila,</HI> lived
the Family of the <HI>Gaylans,</HI> which was
of that sort of <HI>Moors</HI> stiled <HI>Barabàrs,</HI> and
to which through flux of time, the Go∣vernment
of that <HI>Cavíla</HI> was become He∣reditary.
This House (though never low
or obscure) began to be signally advan∣ced
in <HI>Ali Gaylan</HI> the Father, which
proved but a Prophesie of its downfall
in <HI>El Hader</HI> the Son; whose Ambitio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
lost what the others Humility had ob∣tained.
<HI>Ali</HI> was in great favor with <HI>Hai∣áshi,</HI>
and a chief Engine of his advance∣ment,
in which he was observed not
much to endeavor his own. But his great∣est
Renown sprang from his Zeal for the
<PB N="31" REF="28"/>
<HI>Mahumetan Law,</HI> an Artifice which sel∣dom
failes, &amp; a knack with which who∣soever
is gifted, cannot want Reverence
among the <HI>Moors. Arzila</HI> being much
moved with his Sanctity, invited him to
a residence among them, which they re∣warded
with considerable Rents, and
great Testimonies of respect.</P>
<P>This <HI>Ali Gaylan</HI> spent the last Scene
of his Life with great satisfaction to
<HI>Haiáshi</HI>'s prosperity, whom at his Death
he left without any threatning Progno∣sticks
of an alteration in his State: But
when he grew sensible of the near ap∣proaches
of his end, he called for his Be∣loved
<HI>El Hader,</HI> to whom he recom∣mended
the care of his Family, Govern∣ment
of his <HI>Cavlla,</HI> imitation of his
Conversation and Faith to <HI>Haiáshi. El
Hader</HI> was too young for the undertaking
all this when his Father dyed, which
caused the provident Parent to leave him
to the careful Tuition of <HI>Hamet Benzían,
Almocadèn</HI> of <HI>Beni-Haròs,</HI> with whom he
remained, till removed thence by <HI>Ben-Boucar,</HI>
after the reducement of <HI>Haiáshi.</HI>
About the xxiii of his Age, this <HI>El Hader
Ben Ali Gaylan,</HI> was married to the
<PB N="32" REF="29"/>
Daughter of one <HI>Akadim,</HI> a principal
Man in <HI>Beniworfut,</HI> upon which Mar∣riage
he had license to return home; a
Concession that proved very fatal to
<HI>Ben-Boucar.</HI> For <HI>El Hader</HI> being got
to his own Territories, where he received
an affectionate wellcome; there hap∣pened
a Commotion in the populous <HI>Ca∣víla</HI>'s
of <HI>Saphean, Sháwia,</HI> and <HI>Homàr,</HI>
(all <HI>Alarbes)</HI> which denyed to pay <HI>Ben-Boucar</HI>
the accustomed Rights, &amp; were so
far from an obedient tender thereof, that
they inhumanely murthered his two Bre∣thren,
<HI>Abdelhálac</HI> and <HI>Missínievi,</HI> whom
he sent to demand them.</P>
<P>The news of this Insurrection quickly
arrived <HI>El Hader,</HI> who thereupon, with
some of the best Horse of his <HI>Cavíla,</HI> in∣stantly
posted to <HI>Alcazar,</HI> where accord∣ing
to Intelligence he met with <HI>Ali Ben
Hamet, Haiáshi</HI>'s Murtherer, whom with
his own hand he killed, in revenge of the
Murther he had committed upon his Fa∣thers
Friend: In whose death, he pull'd
down one of <HI>Ben-Boucars</HI> best Support∣ers
in this Canton of his Dominion. Next
he speeded to <HI>Arzíla,</HI> forsaken by <HI>Ben-Boucars</HI>
Alcáyde, who upon the tydings
<PB N="33" REF="29"/>
of <HI>Hamets</HI> death, and the <HI>Alárbes</HI> revolt,
durst not trust himself among a People
whom he saw zealously to favor his Ma∣sters
Enemy.</P>
<P>Upon this <HI>Gaylan</HI> appeared at <HI>Ar∣zíla,</HI>
which was very acceptable to his
Fathers old Admirers, who readily yield∣ed
him their utmost Assistances, and
were seconded with several of the adja∣cent
<HI>Cavíla</HI>'s. <HI>Ben-Boucar</HI> coming to
chastize the seditious <HI>Alárbes,</HI> and to a∣venge
his Brothers blood, which he spee∣dily
dispatc'd; his next care was to ren∣der
<HI>Gaylan</HI> sensible of his Deportment,
who, upon his advance, took sanctuary
in <HI>Arzíla,</HI> where he lay immured, till such
time as necessity forced <HI>Ben-Boucar</HI> to
withdraw his Levies. Upon every such
retreat, <HI>Gaylan</HI> was still at his wonted
disturbances, and yet upon every re∣turn
of the Enemy, he betook himself
to the protection of <HI>Arzila;</HI> Out of
which nothing could fetch him, but a
close, tedious, and expensive Siege, a
thing ill agreeing with the <HI>Moors</HI> Custom
and Provision.</P>
<P><HI>Ben-Boucar,</HI> weary of that Fatigue, in
which for some Years he had been exer∣cised,
<PB N="34" REF="30"/>
and whereof he saw no end, pro∣ferr'd
<HI>Gaylan</HI> this Accommodation: That
if he would pay him the accustomary
Tributes, and an acknowledgement of
superiority, he should peaceably possess
the Government of <HI>Arzila,</HI> and his own
<HI>Cavíla. Gaylan</HI> was not backward to ac∣cept
an Accommodation so favorable to
his present Condition and future De∣signs;
being at that time shut up in <HI>Ar∣zila,</HI>
and yet entertaining an ambition
of making himself Lord of the Coun∣trey.
This accommodation being rati∣fyed,
<HI>Ben-Boucar</HI> returned home, and
<HI>Gaylan</HI> was set at liberty to take his Di∣vertisements
in the Countrey, where his
plausible Fortune and Personage, Zeal
for their Law, and reservation of Car∣riage,
made the Grandees of the Coun∣trey
greatly affected with his Society.
<HI>Gaylan</HI> finding himself under so favorable
an Aspect, thought of Strengthning his
Intentions by contracting Alliances with
the best <HI>Casts:</HI> whereupon he took him
a second Wife, a Daughter of <HI>Cassian
Shot Almocadèm</HI> of the <HI>Cavila</HI> called <HI>An∣gera,</HI>
a Warlike Family, and descended
of the <HI>Andalusian</HI> Moors banished <HI>Spain.</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="30"/>
His third Wife was the Daughter of <HI>Co∣gèr
Alcáyde</HI> of <HI>Alcazar,</HI> and a leading
Person in that part of the Countrey.
His fourth was a Virgin Daughter of
<HI>Múfadal,</HI> Governor of <HI>Tituan,</HI> which
made up the <HI>legal number</HI> of <HI>four,</HI> so ma∣ny
being allowed by their Prophet: up∣on
the death of his second Wife, to keep
up the account, he marryed the Daugh∣ter
of one <HI>Messimd,</HI> a popular Person in
<HI>Tituàn,</HI> and descended of a Saint.</P>
<P>By these Alliances he got an Interest
both in the Persons and Places of great∣est
moment in this part of the Countrey,
by which he was animated to break with
<HI>Ben-Boucar:</HI> a design of such nature,
that <HI>Gaylan</HI> durst not venture thereon
in any open Declaration, but advisedly
disguised it under a pretended Enter∣prise
against the Christians, Garrison'd
in several Towns on the <HI>Barbary</HI> Coast,
maintained by the Crowns of <HI>Portugal</HI>
and <HI>Spain.</HI> Which to effect the better,
he first shewed the <HI>Moors</HI> how their
Prophet, both by his <HI>Example</HI> and
<HI>Doctrine,</HI> had taught them to exercise
their Revenge against all Opposers of his
<HI>Law;</HI> and that whoever should dye in
<PB N="36" REF="31"/>
its Defense or Propagation, were assu∣red
of Paradise; and then concluded,
how much it would redound to the ho∣nor
of that Generation, if they should
drive the Christians out of their Coun∣trey,
to <HI>which</HI> and their Religion they
were the <HI>common Enemy.</HI></P>
<P>This Proposal was strangely moving
with People of all capacities, and the
report of <HI>Gaylans</HI> Intentions against the
Christians, induced many to be his Fol∣lowers,
who otherwise would have es∣chewed
his Company: But having drawn
in some by his Affinity, others with fair
Promises, and the generality with Re∣ligious
Pretences, he began a little to
pull aside the Vail, and shew the naked
Face of his Design. Having given some
Testimonies of his Zeal and Valour a∣gainst
the Christians, and enraged them
to an activity above what they had of late
expressed: He likewise laid before them
their necessity of Union, and that they
should combine under one Leader, the
better to carry on what they had begun.
He also set before them their unhappi∣ness
to be governed by one whom <HI>age</HI>
and <HI>distance</HI> render'd so unfit to relieve
<PB N="37" REF="31"/>
them, in case of sudden necessity; and
withall magnifyed his Title to the Go∣vernment
of the Country, equal to <HI>Ben-Boucars.</HI>
The People found no reason
to dispute any part of <HI>Gaylans</HI> Harangue,
in which they could perceive he aimed at
nothing but their safety. Whereupon
the <HI>Alcáyde</HI> of <HI>Alcasar, El Hàders</HI> Fa∣ther-in-law,
was the first that declared
for his Government, who was seconded
with several other Grandees of the
Countrey, so that in short time all the
<HI>Cavíla</HI>'s which <HI>Ben-Boucar</HI> had taken
from <HI>Haiáshi,</HI> left him as they had done
their former Master, and adhered to
<HI>Gaylan.</HI> But <HI>Sálla</HI> and <HI>Tituàn</HI> utterly
dissented from the rest, and instead of
yielding a tame submission to <HI>Gaylans</HI>
Empire, they altogether resisted him.
This moved <HI>El Hader</HI> to advance his
Forces first against <HI>Tituàn,</HI> which he
found very stubborn: for <HI>Abdel Crim
Nacsis</HI> (the chief Governor thereof)
would be inclined to no thoughts of <HI>Pa∣cification</HI>
or <HI>Surrender,</HI> while he could
cherish any hopes of being relieved by
his near Relative <HI>Ben-Boucar.</HI> But at
length, despairing of any Succors, and
<PB N="38" REF="32"/>
seeing the great spoils <HI>Gaylan</HI> was like to
make of their Vineyards, Gardens, and
Houses of Pleasure about the Town,
which the Inhabitants highly valued for
their profit and delight, he sought to
prevent him in that desolation, by a ma∣ture
and timely Address for Peace:
which was welcome News to <HI>Gaylan,</HI> be∣ing
very covetous to be Master of a place
so considerable for Strength, Riches,
and Traffick. The Articles were soon
concluded, <HI>Gaylan</HI> demanding no more
then their subjection, a constant Levy of
Soldiers to serve him on occasions of
greater moment; and that one of his
own Election should be equal in the Go∣vernment
with <HI>Nacsis.</HI> Upon this Paci∣fication
with <HI>Tituan, Gaylan</HI> march'd a∣gainst
<HI>Sálla,</HI> which was under the Rule
of that great Saint, <HI>Abdala Ben-Boucar,</HI>
who upon weak Temptations retired to
the Castle, leaving <HI>Gaylan</HI> the Signory of
the Town, wherein he placed some For∣ces
of his own, to secure the Inhabitants
from Apostacy. But not long after, <HI>Ab∣dala</HI>
being sore pressed for want of Pro∣visions,
and hopeless of being succored
by his Father, privily quitted the Castle,
<PB N="39" REF="32"/>
having first of all sent away in an English
Frigat, his Wives to <HI>Phedálla.</HI></P>
<P>The gaining of this Castle made <HI>Gay∣lan</HI>
sole Master of this North West Can∣ton
of <HI>Barbary,</HI> beyond which he was
never able to enlarge his Territories; al∣beit
he was strugling for more room, as
foreseeing that endeavors after more,
was the means to be secure of what he
had got already. He often tryed his va∣lor
upon the <HI>Xerif, Hamet Bocálla,</HI> chief
of <HI>Benzaruel,</HI> and <HI>Beni-Hálet,</HI> but his
Attempts still proved successless, for
those <HI>Cavila</HI>'s are almost inaccessible by
reason of their Mountainousness. <HI>Erif,
Botoía, Beniuphràsh, Benimisgíldah,</HI> and
<HI>Benijaacòb,</HI> being all large <HI>Cavíla</HI>'s which
for Generations had been govern'd by
the house of <HI>Arras,</HI> under the title of <HI>Al∣cayde,</HI>
never receiv'd any attempt of <HI>Gay∣lan</HI>'s
reducing them. And albeit he want∣ed
neither courage nor ambition to have
made himself Sultan of <HI>Barbary,</HI> yet his
Stars denyed him that Grandeur, and he
was never able to stretch his Arm beyond
the command of 22 <HI>Cavíla</HI>'s, whose names
are hereunto annexed, with the number
of their usual levies of Men for the Wars.</P>

<P>These are all, or the most of them
<HI>Barabars,</HI> who have fixed Habitations,

living in Neighborhood and a setled
Conversation; and of these consisted
<HI>Gaylans</HI> chief Forces: yet he had be∣sides
these four <HI>Cavíla</HI>'s of <HI>Alárbes,</HI>
namely, <HI>Delholòt, Sháwia, Beni-Guedàr,</HI>
and <HI>Saphián,</HI> which are reported to be
very numerous and Warlike, lying West
of <HI>Salla</HI> and <HI>Alcazar:</HI> But by reason of
their untractable nature, and floating
manner of living, they are not so cer∣tain
in their Musters, nor ready upon E∣mergencies.
These <HI>Gaylan</HI> could never
bring under a perfect subjection, but was
content they should pay some small Tri∣bute
in acknowledgement to his Supe∣riority.</P>
<P>The above mentioned <HI>Cavíla</HI>'s were
the total of <HI>Gaylans</HI> Dominions, beyond
which he could never make any Enlarge∣ment.
He was for the space of twelve
Years prosperous in his Government, and
the general success of his Enterprises,
raised him highly in the estimate of his
Followers: <HI>It being the Genius of this
People, to make the Prosperity of the Acti∣on,
an undoubted argument of its Justice,
and the voice of Heaven to approve it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gaylan</HI> from his Youth was trained up
<PB N="44" REF="35"/>
in Arms: And for the Adventures he had
made upon <HI>Tanger,</HI> when <HI>Portugúes,</HI> was
called the <HI>Almocaden</HI> of those Fields.
But not to mention any thing of his pro∣ceedings
against the Christian (that be∣ing
no design of this Paper) we find him
constantly in War with the <HI>Moor. Ben-Boucar</HI>
was still Master of <HI>Fez,</HI> and rea∣dy
upon every frail Temptation to en∣ter
<HI>Gaylans</HI> Frontiers, which kept them
both in continual Hostility. The Peo∣ple
at length wearied out with the inces∣sant
Troubles occasioned by these Ri∣vals
for the Supremacy, were ready to
adhere to some third Party, able to set∣tle
the Government in such a single Per∣son,
as both by Title and Strength should
be above an ordinary Competitor:
Which unexpectedly came to pass in the
Sixteen hundred and sixty fifth of the
Crucifixion; for about the entrance of
that Year, <HI>Muley Reshid</HI> first appeared
with the Prognosticks of a Revolution,
of whom I here set down this short Ac∣count.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Dara,</HI> in <HI>Numedia,</HI>
the Countrey of <HI>Mahumed Ben Amet,</HI>
Founder of the <HI>Xeriffian</HI> Empire, there
<PB N="45" REF="35"/>
arose a <HI>Mulátto</HI> (one whose Father was
white, and Mother black) one <HI>Reshid
Ben Mahumed,</HI> a Native of the Town of
<HI>Taffilete,</HI> the place whether <HI>Mahumed</HI>
(the second Son of <HI>Mahumed Ben Amet)</HI>
the second of that Family (who was Em∣peror
of <HI>Morocco)</HI> had confined his eldest
Brother <HI>Amet,</HI> whom he had taken Pri∣soner.
This <HI>Reshid</HI> ripening in Years
and discretion, began to make himself
known to the World by the name of the
<HI>Xeriff</HI> of <HI>Tafilete:</HI> By which Title he
made himself descended of the <HI>Xeriffian</HI>
House, which so long had enjoyed the
Empire of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and of the Pro∣phet
<HI>Mahumet. [Xeriff]</HI> (as was said)
being a Name peculiar to that Deceiver.
And because a research into <HI>Moresco</HI> Ge∣neologies
shall have labour for the pains,
I shall enquire no further after <HI>Reshids</HI>
Pedigree, then to observe that his Fa∣ther
was one <HI>Muley Mahumed,</HI> a Prince
of great Authority in <HI>Numedia,</HI> who be∣sides
his four legal Wives, had several
Concubines; of one of which, being
a <HI>Negra,</HI> he begot this <HI>Reshid.</HI> His Fa∣ther
dying while he was a minor, he was
committed to the Tuition of his Elder
<PB N="46" REF="36"/>
Brother <HI>Muley Hamet Ben-Mahumed.</HI>
This <HI>Reshid</HI> having accomplisht his Pu∣pillage,
began to look into his Conditi∣on,
and to enquire what was left him by
his deceased Father: For by the <HI>Mo∣resco</HI>
Institutes, the Sons of Concu∣bines
are equal Sharers in the Patrimo∣ny
with those of the lawful Wives. While
<HI>Reshid</HI> made himself the comparative of
his Brother, he was lost into an Emu∣lation,
that spurr'd him into the endea∣vours
of promoting his Fortunes. He
saw his own Condition, and that of Pub∣lick
Affairs, qualified for no other Pro∣posal
to effect his desired Advancement,
but what was to be obtained by the
Sword: Whereupon he consulted with
his own <HI>Genius,</HI> by what Artifice he might
soonest imbroil <HI>Barbary</HI> in a new War,
and communicated the Design with some
few <HI>Moors</HI> of his own Complexion. At
the first opening of his Adventure, his
Retinue exceeded not the number of
thirty, and those of an inferior Quality,
who yet, by reason of the contracted∣ness
of their Lots, were disposed to ex∣ecute
any Proposition that was probable
to enlarge them.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="36"/>
With this paucity of Adherents, <HI>Re∣shid</HI>
secretly withdrew from <HI>Tafilete</HI> to
<HI>Tessa,</HI> a place abounding with Inhabi∣tants,
but as poor as numerous. Here
<HI>Reshid</HI> received the Royal Title of <HI>Mu∣ley,</HI>
and was Proclaimed King of <HI>Tafilete.</HI>
And in acknowledgement and token of
his Royal Power, the People brought
him Presents, as the known Pledges of
their Loyal subjection. This new <HI>Sul∣tan</HI>
manifested a great disdain of that A∣varitious
humour, which had possessed
the minds of the <HI>Barbarian</HI> Princes,
much inveighing against the sordid De∣votion
of Sacrificing the Wealth of their
Subjects to themselves. He therefore by
a subtil contrariety refused to shrine up
more Money in his Coffers, then might
decently defray Expences, leaving at the
first that pleasing bait to be devoured by
his Proselytes, whereby he purchased a
great reinforcement of his Retinue. <HI>Tes∣sa,</HI>
which he elected for his first <HI>place</HI> of
<HI>Arms,</HI> swarm'd (as was said) with poor
Inhabitants, whose Labors were too lit∣tle
for their Sustenance, which might ren∣der
them the readier to take the Impres∣sion
of any Counsil that was likely to
<PB N="48" REF="37"/>
better their Condition. And <HI>Muley Re∣shid</HI>
is conceived to have repaired to this
beggerly Colony, to meet with an easier
advance of Followers.</P>
<P>By rowling up and down, he had in
short time gathered so great a Bulk, as
threatned an Inundation wheresoever it
should spread it self. Attended with this
numerous Rabble, he addressed himself
to his Elder Brother <HI>Muley Hamet,</HI>
in a posture compounded of Hostility
and Friendship, of whom he demand∣ed
the Estate left him by his Father,
that he might be the better enabled to
perform something worthy of <HI>Their
House.</HI> The two Brothers began to wax
hot in the Conference; and it is said,
that the Language on both sides was so
exasperating, that they had like to have
forgot the distance of their Condition,
and to have closed up their Discourse
with an unmannerly Combate. Both
were so far transported with Anger, that
without the least overture of Reconcile∣ment,
they fell into declared Hostility,
and left their private Quarrel to the
publick determination of a War.</P>
<P>In which <HI>Muley Reshid</HI> was so fortu∣nate
<PB N="49" REF="37"/>
as to slay his Brother, and thereby
was left without any to justle him in the
Government of <HI>Dara.</HI> This success did
so swell <HI>Reshid</HI>'s bosome, that less room
could not circumscribe him then a King∣dom.
The present Affairs of <HI>Barbary</HI>
were auspicious to his Enterprises: the
Countries being rent into petty Monar∣chies,
every <HI>Almocaden</HI> that was able,
having put himself into a defensive Po∣sture,
aiming to live independent in his
Government. This division much faci∣litated
<HI>Muley Reshid</HI>'s Designs: yet no∣thing
was more conducing to his success,
then his careful execution of Justice, the
want whereof had been a general pre∣tended
grievance; every detected Cri∣minal
had condign punishment accord∣ing
to demerit, whereby he became both
beloved and feared.</P>
<P>Together with his care for publick
Justice, he continued his seeming neg∣lect
of Riches; stil dividing among his
<HI>Partizans</HI> the estates of those whom their
own obstinacy made his spoils. But those,
who gently yeilded to his mercy, he ge∣nerously
protected both in their Goods
and Persons. This obliging carryage
<PB N="50" REF="38"/>
gave wings to his <HI>Fame,</HI> and made him
where ever he came to be received with
acclamations; The common voice was
<HI>Illah Enzur Muley Reshid, i.e.</HI> God bless
Prince <HI>Reshid</HI> &amp; the vulgar esteem'd him
sent on purpose to chastize <HI>oppressors.</HI></P>
<P>Having made himself master of his
Brothers Territories, he advanced to∣wards
<HI>Erìf</HI> govern'd by the <HI>Alcayd
Arras,</HI> who was his Brothers confede∣rate,
and his Father-in-law, and who
in confidence of this relation (if we may
credit report) granted <HI>Muley Reshid</HI> a
peaceable admission into his Dominions;
wherein for some Moons he deported
himself as a Son. But being ascertained
of the <HI>Alcayds</HI> intention to contract a
Friendship with <HI>Tanger,</HI> and that he had
dispatch'd an envoy to the same purpose
he concluded that he now wanted no
reason to declare himself an enemy to
the <HI>Alcayd's</HI> proceedings, and under this
pretext arm'd against him. The <HI>Alcayd</HI>
seeing the <HI>Xériff</HI> attempting to dispoil
him of his Territories; and that con∣trary
to all <HI>Ingenuity</HI> and <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>Ho∣spitality;</HI>
he began to usurp the Country
of his Entertainer, he thought it high
<PB N="51" REF="38"/>
time to provide for his defence. There∣fore
with some <HI>Extemporary Forces</HI> he
repaired to the <HI>Maritim Bos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mma</HI> where
he reinforc'd a small Fort; not out of
any hopes to maintain it against the
<HI>Xériff,</HI> but thereby to have the advan∣tage
of surrendring it and himself upon
gentler Articles. <HI>Muley Reshid</HI> advised
of the <HI>Alcaids</HI> flight, addressed himself
to the pursuit, and overtook him at the
mentioned Fortress. Which in few daies
the <HI>Alcayd</HI> delivered up to be demo∣lish'd
by the <HI>Xeriff,</HI> and himself his pri∣soner.</P>
<P>This Victory, or rather surprisal of
the <HI>Alcayd</HI> was a fair accession to <HI>Re∣shids</HI>
power, having now subjected the
only Potentate, whom the rest of the
neighbouring Grandees had so often
Courted for a Confederate.</P>
<P>Having thus obtained the command of
<HI>Erìf</HI> and the rest of his <HI>Fatherinlaws</HI>
Country, it raised in him no less aspire∣ing
hopes then to become <HI>Sultan</HI> of
<HI>Mauritania Tingitana,</HI> at that time rent
into parties. To the accomplishing of
which design he saw the gaining of <HI>Fez</HI>
would contribute much to his esteem,
<PB N="52" REF="39"/>
and give him admission into the heart of
the Kingdome. Upon this consideration
he resolutely march'd to trye his for∣tunes
with that ancient and famous Me∣tropolis.
This City was lately in the
Government and Possession of <HI>Cidi Ma∣humed,</HI>
second Son to <HI>Ben Boucar,</HI> who
was despoiled thereof, together with his
Life, by the cruelty of <HI>Bensállah, So∣heìr,</HI>
and <HI>Doríedi,</HI> said all to be <HI>Anda∣luzian</HI>
Moors, and who had the Govern∣ment
thereof divided among them, when
<HI>Reshid</HI> came against it. The news of
whose approach no sooner reach'd <HI>Fez.</HI>
but the Governors, whom guilt had made
cowardly, betook themselves to the
strongest holds of the City, depositing
the Keys into such Hands, as they thought
fittest to be entrusted with the protecti∣on
of the Gates. <HI>Reshid</HI> seeing that <HI>Fez</HI>
was likely to cost him dear, if he stayed
to take it by a formal Siege, thought of
having recourse to Stratagem; knowing
that he who aspires after nothing but
Conquest, ought not to binde him∣self
to the Laws of a fair Gamester.</P>
<P><HI>Reshid</HI> had so long pressed the City by
impeding their Markets, that he might
<PB N="53" REF="39"/>
reasonably imagine there was a want of
provision of Cattel; whereupon he re∣solved
to lodge some of his Forces near
the City Walls, and that himself, with
about sixteen more, would drive some
Cattel to the Gates of <HI>Fez,</HI> under the
disguise of Friends come to bring them
Provision. This he put in execution in
the Night, and coming with the Cattel
to the Gates, with a Voice counterfeit∣ing
haste and fear, they called to the
Guards for entrance, and desired that
they would take into their Protection
them and the booty brought for their
succour. Two were admitted to enter,
whereof the <HI>Xeriff</HI> is said to have been
one, who instantly slew the Centinel, and
thereby made way for the rest; who ha∣ving
seised the Keys, straight ascended a
small Turret over the Gate, and thence
gave the Signal to his Forces, lodged near
for the purpose to advance: And the
small Gun that was placed in the Gate,
he caused to be turned upon the City.
The Citizens being miserably confused
and affrighted at the suddenness of the
action, were not recovered of their Di∣stractions
till <HI>Reshid</HI> poured in his Army
<PB N="54" REF="40"/>
amongst them; against whom being un∣able
to make any considerable oppositi∣on,
their last and only succour was a
timely submission, which they perform∣ed
with such humility, that <HI>Reshid</HI> had
no temptation to reject it. After they
were received into protection, the <HI>Fez∣ans</HI>
were not penurious in complaints a∣gainst
their Governors, imputing it to
their wilfull Pride, that the <HI>Xerif</HI> was
not received with such evidences of Ho∣nor,
as they had always born to that Ti∣tle.
But not staying at such useless Com∣plements,
<HI>Reshid</HI> in the first place took
into his possession the ancient Treasures
of the Kings of <HI>Fez.</HI> Next, he caused
the three Governors to be brought be∣fore
him, and having told them of their
great Oppressions of the People, he com∣manded
one of them to be burnt imme∣diately,
another to be dragg'd about the
Streets till he was dead; but the third he
committed to custody, and afterward is
said to have kill'd him with his own
hand: And then declared, <HI>That this was
the just recompence of all those who deal
unjustly with the People.</HI></P>
<P>And having thus subjected the famous
<PB N="55" REF="40"/>
<HI>Fez,</HI> his next Trophies he design'd up∣on
<HI>Ben-Boucar,</HI> whom without much re∣sistance
he took Prisoner, and brought
to <HI>Fez,</HI> and there granted him a liberal
Confinement, in token of that respect
which he bore his Piety and Age. After
this, he went against the <HI>Xerif</HI> of <HI>Ben∣zaruèl,</HI>
who proved a very resolute E∣nemy,
for with the strength of his own
<HI>Cavíla</HI> he found a Months work for all
<HI>Reshids</HI> Army, but at length was forced
to render himself Prisoner, and still re∣mains
in that Condition.</P>
<P><HI>Reshid</HI> had now so far advanced his
Dominion in the Kingdom of <HI>Fez,</HI> that
he had none therein to oppose him but
<HI>El Hader Ben Ali Gaylan;</HI> who for his
<HI>military Skill, personal Valour,</HI> and ma∣ny
Years of <HI>Success</HI> and <HI>Settlement</HI> in his
Government, rendred <HI>Tafilete</HI> dubious
in his Councils how to proceed against
him. <HI>Tafraught,</HI> a prodigious ridge of
Mountains, so secured <HI>Gaylans</HI> Fronti∣ers,
that no part was left passable, but
what might easily be guarded. And there∣fore
to enter <HI>Gaylan</HI>'s Dominions by o∣pen
violence, <HI>Tafilete</HI> foresaw would cost
him the expense of more time then his
<PB N="56" REF="41"/>
Affairs could spare: upon which refle∣ction,
he fell to his successful Art of ma∣king
a false Party in his Enemies Camp,
that he might obtain by <HI>intestine Trea∣chery,</HI>
what in this case he could not by
his own <HI>Force.</HI> To this end he secretly
enter'd into correspondence with <HI>Cidi
Lasin El Phut,</HI> Governor of <HI>Benittaròs,
(Gaylans</HI> chief Frontier <HI>Cavíla)</HI> who was
entrusted with the Avenue that let into
<HI>Gaylans</HI> Country. <HI>Lasin</HI> was not much
indisposed to a Revolt from <HI>Gaylan,</HI> be∣ing
one of those whom he had highly dis∣pleased
in not calling them to the ad∣jousting
of the last Peace with <HI>Tanger,</HI>
nor to partake of its Benefits (which
was very fatal to that juncture of <HI>Gay∣lan</HI>'s
Affairs) and because he saw the
growing power of <HI>Tafilete,</HI> and that al∣beit
for a while they might resist him, yet
in time he would eat through their <HI>Alps.</HI>
Upon these Temptations, or what other,
we may imagine operative upon the <HI>wa∣ry,
covetous, aspiring</HI> and <HI>revengeful</HI> na∣ture
of a <HI>Moor, Lasin</HI> contracted with
<HI>Tafilete, Reshid,</HI> or the <HI>Xeriff</HI> (which in
this Narrative do all express the same
Person) to advise him, when he should
<PB N="57" REF="41"/>
attach the Passage, who to that end had
always a select Band in readiness. And
when by his own Example <HI>Lasin</HI> had
taught the Guards to be remiss, and had
got the advantage of <HI>Gaylans</HI> absence, he
gave <HI>Tafilete</HI> the Signal, who gain'd the
Passage, and with such suddenness set
upon the Reserves, that they were not
able to make any considerable resistance.</P>
<P>The news of this Disaster soon reacht
<HI>Alcazar,</HI> where <HI>Gaylan</HI> was entertaining
himself with his Relation <HI>Cogez,</HI> who
with some of his best Troops march'd to
the succour of his other Forces, which
otherwise had been totally destroyed.
<HI>Gaylan</HI> in this Encounter gave great te∣stimonies
of his Valour, and had, no
doubt, given the Enemy a brave repulse,
if his Infantry had not been wholly dis∣comfited
ere he could come to their re∣lief.
At last, finding himself oppressed
with number, he was forced to order the
Party that stuck to him to seek for their
safety, and himself, with about six more,
retreated to <HI>Arzila;</HI> from whence, as
one not well recover'd of the fright, he
acquainted that Excellent Person, Co∣lonel

then in League) with his Disgrace, in this

</LETTER>
<P>Assoon as the Lieutenant Governor
had perused the Letter, he resolved to
gratifie <HI>Gaylan</HI>'s desires, as being glad of
an opportunity to vindicate the <HI>honour</HI>
of the <HI>English Nation</HI> from some impu∣tations,
which <HI>Gaylan</HI> objected to the
Lieutenant Governor (when he was with
<PB N="60" REF="43"/>
him at <HI>Arzila)</HI> and which was chiefly oc∣casioned
through some mistake between
the Great <HI>Tiveot</HI> and <HI>Gaylan,</HI> concerning
the time when the War should commence
in the Year 1663. For albeit the Earl
of <HI>Tiveot</HI> had sufficiently cleared the Ho∣nor
and Justice of that Action, yet <HI>Gay∣lan</HI>
seeming not so to apprehend it, the
Lieutenant Governor was glad of an oc∣casion
to let him know, That it was the
mind of his Master, the King of <HI>Great
Brittain,</HI> that all his Ministers should be
punctual in the observation of what they
stipulated in his Name. To which end,
in a generous and well-composed Let∣ter,
the Lieuteuant Governor condoled
<HI>Gaylan</HI>'s mis-fortune, assuring him of his
Friendship, and that he would exactly
comply with every Article of the Peace
concluded betwixt <HI>Tanger</HI> and his Ex∣cellency;
and that if any of his Vassals,
Allies, or Domestiques, should in any
Exigence make <HI>Tanger</HI> their Sanctuary,
they should find it no otherwise, and that
they should be treated according to their
Quality and Condition. This Letter
was sent by a Kinsman of the Lieutenant
Governors, who according to directions,
<PB N="61" REF="43"/>
confirm'd <HI>Gaylan</HI> in the belief of meet∣ing
with all the succors that he could
reasonably expect from the lately con∣tracted
Friendship.</P>
<P>This Message, whose kindness was
doubled by its seasonableness and speed,
put new Spirits into <HI>Gaylan</HI>'s drooping
Concerns, and gave him Courage to
sound the temper of his revolted <HI>Caví∣la</HI>'s,
which he found well disposed to
his Service, albeit they were forced to
dissemble their Intentions till their Har∣vest
was secured, least otherwise they
should second the War with a Dearth▪
for so little is the Provision of the
<HI>Moors,</HI> that the loss or miscarriage of
one Crop, brings a Famine.</P>
<P>But while <HI>Gaylan</HI> was laboring to re∣tard,
<HI>Tafilete</HI> was improving his last Vi∣ctory:
and having possess'd himself of
the Passage into his Enemies Territo∣ries,
he quickly became Master of <HI>Alca∣zàr,</HI>
the chiefest of <HI>Gaylan</HI>'s Inland
Towns, which was deserted by <HI>Cidi Ha∣met
Cogèz,</HI> who for many Years had go∣vern'd
there by the Title of <HI>Alcayde.</HI>
The tydings of the <HI>Xerifs</HI> Successes no
sooner reach'd <HI>Tituan,</HI> but that Town
<PB N="62" REF="44"/>
declared for him, and with their best
Solemnity Proclaimed him King. At the
same time the <HI>Shat</HI> of <HI>Angera,</HI> a prin∣cipal
Person in those parts, nearly re∣lated
to <HI>Gaylan</HI> by Blood and Marriage,
retired to the Woods in the Bay of that
<HI>Alcazàr,</HI> which stands upon the Midland
Sea; where he resolved to conceal him∣self,
whil'st he sent his Domestiques to
<HI>Ceuta,</HI> a <HI>Spanish</HI> Garrison, and <HI>Tanger,</HI>
to procure <HI>Seguròs</HI> for himself and Fa∣mily,
in case the <HI>Xerif</HI> should prove im∣placable,
and refuse to receive him un∣to
fair Quarters.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Shat</HI> of <HI>Angera</HI> tired with his
retreat, and cherishing some dull hopes
of <HI>Gaylan</HI>'s Recovery, sent in a Bille<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to the Lieutenant Governor of <HI>Tanger</HI>
in <HI>Moresco,</HI> in which he seemed to insi∣nuate,
that he intended no submission
to the <HI>Xerif,</HI> which was Translated thus.</P>
<P>The Letter of <HI>Almócadem Casum Shat,</HI>
and his Sons <HI>Almócadem, Abdelcrìm,</HI> and
<HI>Almócadem Ali,</HI> to the Captain of <HI>Tan∣ger,</HI>
whom we honor much. Desiring that
he would do them the favour to send them
four Kintals of Powder, four hundred
<PB N="63" REF="44"/>
Balls, and a Kintal of Lead, with fifty or
more Muskets: and that if the Captain
have any need of Wood or Barley, they will
repay him in that Commodity: This they
sollicit as <HI>Gaylan</HI>'s faithful Friends.</P>
<P>I have inserted this Letter for the sake
of its stile, being the first and only Ad∣dress
made in this manner to any of the
English Governors in <HI>Tanger.</HI> But how
hopeful soever the <HI>Shats</HI> Affairs might
appear at the date of this Letter, yet
very shortly after they seem'd to be in
a very languishing state, as was easily
to be collected by a large account there∣of
given to <HI>Cidi Hamet Algílo,</HI> who was
then in <HI>Tanger,</HI> and which is here trans∣lated
out of <HI>Arabique</HI> thus.</P>
<P>The Letter of <HI>Taliffo Hamet El Shat,</HI>
which is bid to salute <HI>Hamet Algílo,</HI> and
to give him an account of the Troubles that
have happened here; how that the same
Night that <HI>Taliffo Hamet El Shat</HI> left
<HI>Angera,</HI> he came into the Fields of <HI>Tan∣ger,</HI>
where he killed two Men, and took
away their Goods; and returning to the
<HI>Aldéa</HI> (or Village) he found not one Per∣son
<PB N="64" REF="45"/>
at his House, neither Man nor Woman,
except <HI>Ali El Hag</HI> in the House of our Ʋn∣cle
<HI>Abdelcrim:</HI> all our Kinred were fled
to <HI>Ceuta.</HI> But coming to speak with the
People of <HI>Angera,</HI> they desired us for the
love of God to leave them, whereupon they
also fled to <HI>Ceuta:</HI> He that did this was
<HI>Ben-Halóo.</HI> I thereupon writ a Letter
to the King, to desire to have pity upon us.
I writ also to <HI>Almocadem Hamet Ben-Léefi,</HI>
and now write again for the Kings
Answer, and according to it I shall advise
both them and thee. Have thou patience,
and within two or three days the Answer
will be come. Moreover, I let thee know,
that we are guarding our Houses from fire
and mischief, having every Night twenty
upon the Guard. I endeavour to keep up
my Peoples courage. Know moreover, that
the King hath given to <HI>Abdelháder Alfif∣toah,</HI>
the Government of <HI>Angera,</HI> but the
People will not receive him, but have writ
to the King about it, though as yet they
have no answer. Lastly, I give thee to
understand, That the King hath burned
the Village of <HI>Benigerfut,</HI> and taken a∣way
their Goods.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="45"/>
So various was <HI>Gaylan</HI>'s Fortunes,
that while at one place he seem'd despe∣rate,
in another he was victorious, and
notwithstanding that at <HI>Angera Taffilete</HI>
was a Conquerour, as his letter inti∣mates,
at <HI>Arzila</HI> he was subdued; for
from thence <HI>Gaylan</HI> assured his Confe∣derates
that all his <HI>Cavílas</HI> were re∣turn'd
to their Obedience, that they had
massacred those <HI>Tafilete</HI> had left to keep
them in awe, and shut him in between
two rocky mountains; and that him∣self
was hastening thither to see his e∣nemy
and act his Catastrophe, and to
put a period to the war. At the same
time he gave out that <HI>Tituàn</HI> was peni∣tent
for their Revolt, and weary of the
<HI>Xerifs</HI> exactions, and were ready to joyn
with him to effect the utter overthrow
of that Imperious Invader.</P>
<P>Yet what face soever <HI>Gaylan</HI> put up∣on
his condition, it was certain that
<HI>Taffilete</HI> dayly advanced his conquest,
and at the same time when his ene∣my
thus confidently reported his di∣stress;
he was in a flourishing condition,
for the <HI>Xerif</HI> had then routed all <HI>Gay∣lan</HI>'s
fresh recruits, and in detestation
<PB N="66" REF="46"/>
of him had taken up the bones of his Fa∣ther
and burn'd them, saying, <HI>That he
deserved no better, who was the root
of that bramble, which had so long ty∣rannically
rent and torn the poor.</HI></P>
<P>He had also taken Prisoners some of
<HI>Gaylan's</HI> nearest relations, and sent them
to <HI>Fez,</HI> and committed great spoiles up∣on
their goods, whom he found absent
from their habitations, and had brought
a considerable wing within a league of
<HI>Arzila,</HI> where if he had stay'd to streigh∣ten
it, want of bread within a few moons
would have constrain'd them to surren∣der.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Tituàn</HI> was at this time
likewise so far from resuming <HI>Gaylan</HI>'s
Interest, that all things there seem'd set∣led
under the Authority and obedience
of <HI>Taffilete</HI> The notice of wich truth was
the subject of a letter sent to Colonel
<HI>Norwood</HI> (Lieutenant Governor of <HI>Tan∣ger)</HI>
whose Honorable proceedings
had render'd him so esteemed among
the Moors, that <HI>Taffilete</HI> thought him
a fit Person to be complemented; and
to that end order'd his <HI>Alcáyd</HI> of <HI>Tituàn</HI>
to make his address.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The <HI>Alcáyd</HI> from whom this came, was
a French man, <HI>Cidi Hadracháman Ben-Réshed,</HI>
one who had succeeded his Fa∣ther
in the Consulship of <HI>Tituàn,</HI> who
hoping to raise himself with the <HI>Xerif,</HI>
renounced his Christian Religion and
liberty for the <HI>Mahumedan Imposture</HI> and
servitude; and changed the gentle Name
of <HI>Antonie Cheysan,</HI> for this stubborn one
<HI>Hadracháman,</HI> and to encourage his <HI>Con∣version,</HI>
the King made him <HI>Alcayd de la
Mar,</HI> or Receiver of his <HI>Customes</HI> in the
Port of <HI>Tituàn,</HI> and also adopted him for
his Son, by the name of <HI>Ben-Reshed.</HI></P>
<P>The Lieutenant Governour delai'd
not to answer the <HI>Alcáydes</HI> letter, as
importing Trade, the chief thing
which most concern'd the welfare of
<HI>Tanger,</HI> to whose advancement the
Lieutenant Governour alwayes decla∣red
a singular propensity. About the
same time <HI>Hamèt Ben-Isa Nacsis,</HI> &amp; <HI>Hamèt
Ben-Abdelcrìm,</HI> Governours of <HI>Tituàn,</HI>
with other Grandees of the Country
<PB N="69" REF="47"/>
and chief Ministers of the King sought
unto him in matters of Moment. Be∣twixt
whom and <HI>Gaylan</HI> he guided him∣self
so steddily, that the continuance of
his Friendship could not be suspected
by the one, nor want of disposition to
contract a new one by the other. <HI>Ta∣filete</HI>
could not so much esteem him
his enemy as <HI>Gaylan's Freind;</HI> and his fi∣delity
to a <HI>distressed Confederate</HI> removed
all suspicion of being otherwise to a
<HI>prosperous.</HI> And by this wise manage∣ment
he clear'd up those scruples, which
through some mishapprehensions of for∣mer
proceedings (of the Earle of <HI>Tiveot</HI>
above mentioned) had render'd the
<HI>Moors</HI> jealous of the <HI>English fidelity.</HI> But a
litle to return to <HI>Gaylan,</HI> who had by this
so long contemned the condition of his
affaires in a doubtful Style, that at length
an ambiguous intimation of his Enemies
<HI>disgrace</HI> was taken for a clear assertion
of his own. And however he labour'd
to beget or preserve his freinds hopes
of his Restauration, yet it could not
take with those who saw <HI>Taffilete</HI>
master of the whole Country, and all
places of importance replenisht with <HI>his
<PB N="70" REF="48"/>
Creatures;</HI> and <HI>Gaylan</HI> shut up in <HI>Arzi∣la,</HI>
from whence he could create no
more disturbances than amounted to a
few <HI>plundering Sallies,</HI> which served on∣ly
to exasperate the adjoyning <HI>Cavilsas,</HI>
and totally to aliene and estrange them
from his Relief. And yet was this a
mischief which surpassed the <HI>Xerifs</HI> skill
and Power to Remedie, for <HI>Gaylan</HI> might
still have kept <HI>Arzila</HI> from him, as he
had done from <HI>Ben-Bowcar,</HI> if his ac∣complicies
had bin now as Trusty as
they were then; But he found the Scene
so far changed, that he had reason to
<HI>suspect</HI> those in whom he once <HI>confided.</HI>
He saw that the people of <HI>Arzila</HI> were
weary of their confinement, and the
more, because they could not foresee
any hope to be enlarged. And that
they could not but conclude, <HI>That</HI> their
sturdy resistance of <HI>Tafilete,</HI> contrary to
the example of all their Neighbours,
would, if protracted, render him impla∣cable.
All this <HI>Gaylan</HI> was able to read
in their <HI>carriage,</HI> wherein there appear∣ed
so great an alteration, that he clearly
perceived some mischief intended against
him, and fearing that they might appease
<PB N="71" REF="48"/>
<HI>Tafilete</HI> with the Sacrifice of <HI>Gaylan:</HI> he
resolved upon a suddain removal, &amp; ha∣ving
before dealt with the Pyrats of <HI>Al∣ger</HI>
for his <HI>Protection,</HI> when nither press'd
by the Enemy, nor want of Provision, he

<HEAD>Of West Barbary.</HEAD>
<P>VVE finde a Common-wealth
compared to a ship, and the
Western part of Barbary hath
fulfilled the Allegory, not only in re∣spect
of <HI>the intestine</HI> Broyles, wherewith it
has bin so long toss'd; nor yet in regard
that the government thereof hath bin conti∣nually
floating from one faction to another.
But in this especially, that there remaines
no track, or impression, no Registers to ac∣quaint
us with what hath pass'd, except ru∣ines
and devastations, the Genuine memories
of a Desolating war. For to demand of a
<HI>Talib</HI> (one of the most learned sort among
the Moors) the Annals of remote vicissi∣tudes,
or an account of the Traverses that
bear a fresher date, were to baffle his obser∣vation,
and thereby affront his adored lite∣rature.</P>
<P>Now the likeliest reason, that can be ren∣der'd
of this ignorance, is the neglect of pre∣serving
Records of their Transactions, for
<PB N="74" REF="50"/>
the Moores trust all to an Illiterate Tradi∣tion;
insomuch that the best Chronique can
be now compiled of their late changes, must
for the most part be collected from some a∣ged
Grandsires memory; a frail founda∣tion
to support an Historical credit.</P>
<P>As for the Ancient Model of the Mores∣co
Politie, it is so miserably convuls'd &amp; sha∣ken
through manifold alterations caused by
prevailing Interests, that not many of its
first Maxims, nor much of its old Constitu∣tion,
are visible in the present state; And
this superseded my Curiosity in making re∣serches
into the Moors Politiques, further
than to be inform'd of the Methods us'd to
ascend to government by the aspiring facti∣ons
of the last Age, of which I have given
an Account in the foregoing Narrative.
And therefore without the solemnity of any
larger introduction; I shall give a faithful
Narration of the present customs of Barbary
in the succeeding Chapters.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="75" REF="50"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The soile, productions, Commodities,
and Husbandry of the Coun∣trey.</HEAD>
<P><HI>LEo Afer</HI> delivers two Etymologies,
which are so agreable both to the
nature of the <HI>Language,</HI> and Glebe of the
Country, that they may seem to have
bin imposed by <HI>Adam,</HI> the Primitive No∣menclator.
For if we listen to the Moors
language, <HI>Barbary</HI> seems to be descended
from <HI>Barbar,</HI> which signifies an inarti∣culate
murmur and grumbling noise
without accent or harmony, for their
speech is harsh, being very guttural:
which is esteemed an argument of its
Antiquity. And indeed it hath gain'd
the vogue of no less antient a pedigree,
than to be bred of the old <HI>Punic</HI> and <HI>A∣rabian.</HI></P>
<P>Another reason why this Country bears
the name of <HI>Barbary,</HI> may be taken from
the frame and disposition of the Earth,
which being full of wild and unkindly
<PB N="76" REF="51"/>
Tumours, well challengeth the name of
<HI>Bar</HI> (a Word not known to the pre∣sent
Inhabitants) signifying a Desart,
and the duplicate of the Monosyllable
<HI>Bar-Bar</HI> implyeth that of old, <HI>Bar∣bary</HI>
was nothing but a great Solitude.
And for this derivation, <HI>Leo Afer</HI> tells
this Story: King <HI>Iphycus</HI> being driven
out of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> fled into <HI>Aegypt,</HI>
where finding himself much pressed by
his Enemies, and dubious what course
to run for his safety, he asked his Ad∣herents
what they thought was the most
probable way to secure themselves;
whereupon they all, with an unexpect∣ed
consent answered <HI>Barbar,</HI> meaning
thereby that the hopefullest method of
Protection was to pass over <HI>Nilus</HI> into
the Desarts of <HI>Africa.</HI> And finding
this Etymologie to bear so fair a Pro∣portion
with the Complexion and Sur∣face
of the Land, I shall not scruple the
occasion of its Imposition.</P>
<P>But when we look from the outward
shape, to the Productions of the Coun∣trey,
we see the uncomeliness thereof
recompensed in the Fertility, which for∣bids
us to judge of Internal Dowries by
<PB N="77" REF="51"/>
the outward Model: Providence usual∣ly
supplying the defects of the Body
with the abilities of the Mind, it being
the fate of many excellent Parts, like
<HI>Galba</HI>'s, to be ill lodged. The Anci∣ents
accounted Wood and Grain, the
more natural and useful Issues of a Coun∣trey,
as having a more immediate ten∣dency
to supply Mankind with the
greater Necessities of Lodging and Diet.
But in this Canton of <HI>Barbary,</HI> the
Woods are scarce and mean, and fitter
to warm the House then build it. For
ranging their Groves, I found them con∣sist
chiefly of Cork-Trees, which seem'd
to differ but little from the Scarlet-Oak,
excepting the indenture of their Leaves.
Their Fruit is a smaller kind of Acorn,
woody within: At the Root of these
Trees is usually found the <HI>Lentisco,</HI>
which is generally but a shrub, and of
little other service to the <HI>Moors</HI> then to
feed their Goats. The Juice whereof,
mingled with other Ingredients, is used
by the Potters to give a faint colour to
their Earthen-ware, which they find to
enhaunse the price, and advance the
sale.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="52"/>
The next remarkable sort of Wood is
the <HI>Alcaróbe,</HI> a Tree of great Curiosity,
and meriting a larger Note. The <HI>Alcaróbe</HI>
bears a Cod, in quantity▪ and likeness
much resembling the English Bean; the
inner substance thereof is sweet, and
lodgeth hard small Kernels. This Fruit
is eat by the <HI>Moors</HI> of inferior Condi∣tion,
and by all at the Feast <HI>Ashoràh:</HI>
but it is chiefly preserved for their Hor∣ses,
to whom it is both Physick and re∣past.
For as a <HI>Moor,</HI> well skill'd in that
Animal, told me, the Fruit of the <HI>Al∣caróbe</HI>
hath two excellent Properties, to
Drench, and make their Horses Fat.</P>
<P>Some have called the Fruit <HI>Locusta,</HI>
and supposed that it was the <HI>Baptists</HI>
Food in the Wilderness: But others con∣jecture
that St. <HI>Matthew</HI>'s <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, were
only the tops and extremities of Herbs
and Plants. And there are also some
judicious Criticks, who interpret the
<HI>Baptist</HI>'s Locusts to be a kind of Fly or
Grashopper, w<SUP>ch</SUP> in warmer Climates are
very large and many, and were former∣ly
dryed and eaten by the Inhabitants.
But they were observed to yield but
small Nutriment, and ever thought fitter
<PB N="79" REF="52"/>
for Medicine than Alimony. I was told
(but by a Travailer) that in <HI>Aegypt</HI>
these flyes come in such clouds, that
they darken the sky where they ap∣pear,
and that in a short space they con∣sume
the fruits of the Earth where they
are permitted to fall. To prevent which
mischief (he told me that) the people
observing the season of their coming,
prepare against them, and keeping them
from setling by discharging Gunns into
the aire where they are discover'd. That
these locusts and Grashoppers were ea∣ten
by the Barbarous Nations, may be
concluded from the Law that made them
forbidden meat to the Jews, <HI>Levit.</HI> 11.
22.</P>
<P>But to leave the Moor to this sort of
flys, whereof he hath no scarcity, there
is a greater probability that the fruit
of the <HI>Alcaròbe</HI> is the same with the Pro∣digal's
<HI>Ceratia,</HI> or husks; for it doth ex∣cellently
accord with their description
set down by that great intelligence of
Divinity in his Note. <HI>B. S. Luke.</HI> XI.</P>
<P>In some parts of this Countrey there
is great plenty of white Mulberry trees,
nourished on purpose to feed the silk∣worm,
<PB N="80" REF="53"/>
a creature that doth afford the
curious many delightful speculations;
but the Moor regards it only for its e∣molument.
The season of the worm be∣ing
passed, they feed their Cattel with
the residue of the Mulberry leaves.</P>
<P>The Towns of Commerce, and Con∣versation,
have pleasant Orchards of
Orange, Lemons and Limes, with Gar∣dens
yielding plenty and variety of sal∣lad.
And that which maketh their Gar∣dens
both profitable and delightful is,
that they are always fruitful and re∣tain
a refreshing verdure. And this they
effect by keeping the soyle constantly in
a temperate moisture: for the water-courses
are so providently contriv'd
that every Garden receiv's it in due pro∣portion,
and at a certain hour; which
running among the little trenches, af∣fords
a very equal and fertile irriga∣tion.</P>
<P>Besides the Sallad ordinary in other
Countreys, they have one sort rarely to
be met with in Europe, which they call
by a word, sounding spanish <HI>Tomátos.</HI>
This growes in the common fields, and
when ripe is pluckt and eaten with oyle▪
<PB N="91" REF="53"/>
it is pleasant but apt to cloy. <HI>Barengé∣nas,</HI>
as in <HI>Spain,</HI> grow creeping like Cu∣cumers
upon the Ground; These are
boyled with Beef and Mutton, and of no
vulgar estimation among the Moors.</P>
<P>Some <HI>Cavílas</HI> (a division in the Coun∣trey
that much resembles that of Coun∣ties
in <HI>England)</HI> have large and fruitful
Vineyards, and the bloud of the Grape,
though it be utterly prohibited them by
<HI>Mahumed</HI> their Prophet, yet of late
through the licentiousness of the times,
it is liberally quaff'd by many of the
Moors. But that they might not herein
give offence to the weaker <HI>Musul-men,</HI>
nor betray any contempt of the law, they
are generally cautious in this liberty,
and use it, as we say, <HI>Ʋnder the Rose.</HI></P>
<P>The Plants of this Country are very ob∣servable
for their variety and strange∣ness,
for many are to be found in <HI>Bar∣bary,</HI>
which cannot be met with in cold∣er
Climes. And some, which are usual
in other Countreys, are in this found to
differ much from their descriptions in
Common Herbals.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D.</HI> H. W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> This I learned from
a worthy Friend (well read in this part
of Nature) who had enterprised, and
<PB N="92" REF="54"/>
would doubtless have finish'd, a Colle∣ction
of <HI>Barbary</HI> Simples, if his too early
immortality, and immature death had
not depriv'd the world of that profitable
endeavour.</P>
<P>The Grain in this, differs not from
that in other Countreys, excepting that
here are two sorts of Grain, scarce well
known in other parts of the world, The
one they call <HI>Pharoùk,</HI> which is of a les∣ser
size, hungry and course, much re∣sembling,
if not altogether the same,
with the Spanish <HI>Panizo,</HI> and it is only
the more beggarly Moors that use this
for bread. The other is known among
them by the name of <HI>Tourkiá,</HI> which is
a larger body than the former, and yields
good flower, whereof bread is made
for the Nobles of the Land. And as the
Barley and Beans are reapt in April,
the wheat in May and June, so is Sep∣tember
the usual season for gathering
the other kinds of bread-corn.</P>
<P>The rains are to the Moors, what the
Nilescope is said to be to the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI>
for according to their plenty or scarce∣ness,
they are able to foretell the dearth
and plenty of the year. But there is a
<PB N="93" REF="54"/>
sort of Religionists among them, who
measure the products of the earth by the
sins of its Inhabitants, and who divine
of the successe of their tillage from the
Observation of their <HI>Ramadan</HI> (or
Lent) and the due celebrating of their
[Easter] <HI>Hìd Seguèr,</HI> or the little feast
that concludes it.</P>
<P>If the clouds are sparing in showers at
<HI>Seed-time,</HI> and Earing, the crop is lit∣tle
lean; and in their best Harvests,
they seldom reap more than will bring
about the year, so that the failure of
one Crop brings an inevitable dearth
upon the land. The Moors are very obser∣ving
of the <HI>Trade-rains,</HI> (for so they may
not improperly be termed, as never fal∣ling
but at such a time) The former Rain
is call'd by a word importing Blessing,
and the latter <HI>[Nas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n]</HI> or <HI>Holy-water,</HI>
of which names I could meet with no o∣ther
Rationale but Tradition.</P>
<P>There appeares but little industry in
the Moors husbandry, for their tillage
is so mean, that he that sees it may just∣ly
wonder, that the Land under such
small improvement should be so fruit∣ful.
In most parts they plough but with
<PB N="94" REF="55"/>
two Oxen, carelesly tyed by the horns,
and in some <HI>Cavílas</HI> with a like number
of Asses, Mules, Camels, and a baser
breed of Horses. The plough turns up
no more mold, than sufficeth to bury
the seed: for (say they) if the fur∣rows
should be deep, and the drought
begin, er'e that the corn hath broken the
Earth, it would not be able to force a
passage through the stifned clods. They
use no labour to assist the <HI>Arbale</HI> by ma∣nuring
it, except that the Ordure of
their Towns is cast out, not so much to
enrich the Glebe, as to keep themselves
cleanly. But this painful part of hus∣bandry
is supplyed by the Anniversary
burning of the withered grass and stu∣ble,
which servs to help the soyle, and
destroy the Vermin, which otherwise,
especially the Scorpion, would render
the Countrey very dangerous for habi∣tation.</P>
<P>When the Moors have reapt their corn,
they tread it out with Oxen, Camels, &amp;c,
&amp; winnow it upon the place where it
grows, and then set the chaff on fire; In
which particulars they are an excellent
Comment upon the like, reflected upon
<PB N="95" REF="55"/>
in <HI>Sacred Writ.</HI> Instead of Granaries,
they have Caves brick'd or wrought with
stone, call'd <HI>Matamóras,</HI> in which they
reposite their Corn, where it is preserv'd
from the Worm, and other Enemies.
The Straw they chop and keep for their
H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rses, for although there be abundance
of Herbage, yet no part thereof is cured
and preserved for a Winter store of Hay,
which I impute to the <HI>Moors</HI> sloth, ra∣ther
than the needlesness of such a Pro∣vision.</P>
<P>After I had taken this Survey of what
appeared upon the Earth by Nature, or
its Improver, Husbandry, I found suf∣ficient
Instigations, both by Curiosity
and Reason, to dive into its Entrals,
which I have been told are in many pla∣ces
as rich as the best Oars can make
them. And of this Truth there have
appeared large Specimens, about <HI>Tituan,
Alcazàr, Ghebèr, &amp;c.</HI> And the reason
why the <HI>Moors</HI> pursue not so advantage∣ous
a Temptation, may be charg'd upon
their Ignorance, Idleness, or Fear; as
in another place I may have occasion to
demonstrate. The Commodities of this
Countrey bearing the name of <HI>Mercán∣til,</HI>
<PB N="96" REF="56"/>
are chiefly Honey, Wax, Hides, Ma∣rokins
or Córdavans, Dates, Almonds;
course Twine, Mats of a curious Straw
and Workmanship, Mantles, Alheìcks,
and in some places great store of Salt-Peter.
As for the Fabulous abundance
of Gold reported to be found in <HI>Barba∣ry,</HI>
I leave its Legend to the Poets.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Beasts in Barbary, tame
and wild.</HEAD>
<P>THe Survey now passeth one Stair
higher, from Vegetable to Sensible
Creatures, whereof <HI>Barbary</HI> has no less
plenty, than of Grass to maintain them,
but looking into their Flocks and Herds,
I found the latter more numerous, yet
not to that quantity as report inform'd
me. And enquiring why the <HI>Moors</HI> were
more for the Stall, than the Fold; they
replyed, That Cows yielded them more
constant relief than Sheep, and were
more ready to furnish out both their Ta∣bles
<PB N="97" REF="56"/>
and Purses. Their Horses are both
few and mean, and for the most part
much inferiour to those of other Nati∣ons,
which at first created my wonder,
because of the great repute the <HI>Barbary</HI>
Horses had obtain'd in most <HI>European</HI>
Countries. But they have a peculiar
Cast of Barbs able to maintain this Re∣nown,
which the <HI>Moors</HI> carefully pre∣serve,
never imploying them in low and
base Offices, but keep them only for the
Saddle and Military Service. And to the
great ease of their Horses, the <HI>Moors</HI>
have store of Camels for their sorest
Drudgeries. Now the Camel is a Crea∣ture
of strange Bulk and humour, whose
Diet is mean and incredibly little, for
they will Travel great Journeys under
heavy Loads, without further allowance
than the tops of Thistles, or any mean
Herbage. Nor are they less abstemious
in their Bevarage, than Meat; being so
patient of Thirst, that they will Travel
four days without touching Water, and
then at one Drinking take in as much as
will serve them as many Days more. The
<HI>Moor</HI> from Observation hath this gene∣ral
Rule concerning Camels; <HI>viz. That
<PB N="98" REF="57"/>
those which when young drink much and
often, are of a degenerate Linage, and
will never prove serviceable.</HI></P>
<P>There is a Presumption, that the Ca∣mels
engender backward, but <HI>Ali Mulùd,</HI>
an Ancient and Inquisitive <HI>Moor,</HI> would
often swear by the Hairs of his Chin (an
Oath that he had learn'd in the time of
his being a Slave in <HI>Spain)</HI> that he had
much enquired after the manner of the
Camels Copulation, but could meet
with no certain Information therein;
for (said he) these Creatures are strange∣ly
bashful in their Embraces, which
makes them very secret in the time of
their Amours; and to retire, if possible,
even from their Keepers Eye. At the
season of their Coition, both Sexes are
very furious, and like their <HI>Moresco</HI> Ma∣sters,
they never forget to revenge the
Injuries done them at that time. I was
told by an <HI>Alarb,</HI> who had no Tempta∣tion
to abuse my Credulity in such an
unconcerning Story, that the <HI>Mácho,</HI> or
Male Camel, generated with the Female
when she is asleep, and that the Female
brings forth in a kind of negligent slum∣ber.
But I leave the curious Inquisitors
<PB N="99" REF="57"/>
of Nature to discover the frailties of this
Story, and pass on to remark the docile
gentleness of the Camel, which is evi∣dent
in their submission, kneeling to be
loaden and unloaden at their Drivers
pleasure. And we find it reported in the
History of Beasts, <HI>Jonson. Hist. Quadrup.</HI>
That Camels have been taught to dance
exact Measures, which is no more strange,
than the <HI>Ballétto di Caválli,</HI> that not long
since graced the Nuptials of a Duke of
<HI>Florence.</HI></P>
<P>But intending no <HI>Zoography,</HI> I pass
from this and other Tame Quadrupeds,
to observe that <HI>Barbary</HI> hath all sorts
of Beasts that are called Wild: Lions,
Leopards, Wolves, Foxes, <HI>&amp;c</HI> with
great plenty of Jackals, so much famed
for Catoring for the Lyon: They usu∣ally
hunt in Packs, opening with a shril
yelping noise, and are described to be
Mungrel Creatures, of an equivocal
Generation, deriving rapaciousness from
the Wolf their Sire, and cunning from
the Fox their Dam; they are very ra∣venous,
eating Carrion, digging up dead
Bodies, and will feed upon that which a
genuine Fox will not daign to tast.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="58"/>
Wild Boars are no rarity in this <HI>Dio∣cess,</HI>
which the <HI>Moors</HI> hunt and kill in a
Manly Pastime, they being no way sub∣servient
to the Trencher, because all
sorts of Swines Flesh is forbidden Meat
by their Law. But their Slaves, that are
Christians, have permission to dress and
eat them, and know from Experience
that they are very wholesom and strong
Food.</P>
<P>But I shall surcease to Travel further
among these inhospitable Salvages, with
whose descriptions Natural Histories are
so largely replenished, and therefore I
will shut up this Chapter with this gene∣ral
Remark, <HI>That</HI> Barbary <HI>hath variety
of all sorts of Beasts, Birds and Serpents;
the Land affording Habitations most suit∣able

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Division of the Inhabitants,
different manner of living, their
Genius, their entertainment of
Foreign Ministers.</HEAD>
<P>THe Family of <HI>Noah</HI> (saith the Jewish
Antiquary <HI>Flav. Joseph.)</HI> being
jealous of a second Deluge, durst not
descend to Cultivate the Plains, but
dwelt upon the tallest Mountains: till
at length, <HI>Sem</HI> ventured to Inhabit the
Valleys; where they lived in a Cluster,
and seemed suspicious of the Divine
Command, bidding them <HI>disperse and
over-spread the Earth:</HI> fearing that this
might be a Design to scatter them that
they might the more easily be destroyed,
for which reason they long time kept to∣gether
in a close Neighborhood. Out
of which story nothing is needful here
to be collected, but that Mountains have
ever proved the Refuges of the Distres∣sed,
and the People that Inhabited them
<PB N="102" REF="59"/>
valued for their Antiquity above the rest
of the Land. Of which truth, <HI>Barba∣ry</HI>
yields a pregnant instance in the divi∣sion
of her Inhabitants, of which there
are two sorts known among them, by the
usual Names of <HI>Alárbes</HI> and <HI>Barabárs.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Alárbes</HI> are usually by the <HI>Euro∣peans</HI>
stil'd Mountaineers, from the place
of their greatest residence. And these
think themselves the Elder Natives, and
therefore of the better House. They
are not altogether so Civiliz'd as the o∣ther,
but live more rudely and rovingly,
shifting from Mountain to Mountain ac∣cording
to their Exigences, never con∣fining
their rambling humors to any set∣led
Mansion. They live in Haimas or
Tents, made of a course brownish Cloth,
which the Women work and weave of the
Bark of Palmito's mingled with Goats
hair; and these Itinerary Habitations
they remove from one place to another,
in obedience to their fickle Humors and
cogent Necessities. Robbery is their
Master-piece and best Livelyhood; and
in this Estate they much glory, as coming
so near the condition of <HI>Muley Mahu∣méds</HI>
first Votaries. About an Age past
<PB N="103" REF="59"/>
they were very numerous, but the late
Civil Wars have made great abatements
of their Musters.</P>
<P>The other sort of <HI>Moors</HI> are vulgarly
called <HI>Barabàrs,</HI> but by a Dialect <HI>Bré∣bers:</HI>
These have fixed Dwellings, and
live in Neighborhood; and finding Con∣versation
to be useful and safe, affording
Comfort and Profit, they are combin'd
into <HI>Aldéa</HI>'s, or Villages, where their
Cottages are so disposed, that there is
not any considerable disproportion a∣mong
them in respect of their distance
from the <HI>Giemma,</HI> or Church.</P>
<P>Over these <HI>Barabàrs</HI> are Subordinate
Governors or <HI>Almocadens,</HI> to whom
they pay a dutiful Observance. Their
Vocation is Tillage and Grazing; and
live much after the condition of the <HI>La∣baradóres</HI>
in <HI>Spain,</HI> the Paisants in
<HI>France,</HI> and the Boors in <HI>Flanders.</HI> The
<HI>Barabàrs</HI> of late are grown more nume∣rous
than the <HI>Alárbes,</HI> and for several
Years have inhabited both the Moun∣tains
and Campaigns. But albeit they
have taken the Hills from the <HI>Alárbes,</HI>
yet they have left them the reproach of
Robbery, though they themselves are no
Novices in that Mystery.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="60"/>
But notwithstanding their different
Mode of living, they unite in the gene∣ral
Character of Body and Humour: For
they are all of a large Stature, strong
Constitution, stately Carriage, and dif∣fering
in Complexion according to their
conversing with the Sun and Air. Those
whom for distinction I must call the
Gentry, are according to their Rules of
Chivalry well skill'd in managing of the
Horse, and dextrous at the Lance, for
they scorn all toyl that is not Military,
and account no Employment so noble as
that of a Souldier. They agree like∣wise
in Humour, for both are Jealous
and Revengeful. Their Jealousie is pal∣pable
in their Carriage towards their
Wives, whom they keep in great Subje∣ction
and Retirement, which makes A∣dultery
a Stranger to their Beds: Nor
can it reasonably be otherwise, seeing
that the Wife is fully assur'd that the ve∣ry
attempt to pilfer a Pleasure, if dis∣cover'd,
will cost her her Life. They
are likewise implacable in their hatred,
and impatient till they have avenged an
Injury; for they are taught by their Pro∣phet,
<HI>That Revenge is a Virtue.</HI> But
<PB N="105" REF="60"/>
leaving these Passions to the justification
of the <HI>Moresco</HI> Law and Customs, the
<HI>Moors</HI> are guilty of a censorious Suspi∣cion
towards Strangers, which hath no
colour to be excused. This I first ob∣served
in their carriage toward <HI>Don Die∣go
de Palma,</HI> a Cavalier of the Habit of
St. <HI>James,</HI> who being sent to Comple∣ment
<HI>Gaylan</HI> from his <HI>Catholick Majesty,</HI>
and chanceing to smile at the <HI>Moors</HI> De∣portment,
as not answering the starch'd∣ness
of his own Nation; the <HI>Moors,</HI> who
were very circumspect in observing eve∣ry
tittle of the <HI>Don</HI>'s Deportment, were
so sagacious as to find in this casual Smile
a derision of their Courtship, which they
left not unrevenged in intrigueing his
Errand. Now it is observable, that the
<HI>Moors</HI> are very morose and abstemious
in point of Laughter, esteeming those
who are much thereunto addicted, to be
scornful and foolish.</P>
<P>And now having promised to give an
account of the <HI>Moresco</HI> manner of re∣ceiving
Publick Ministers, and finding
that they have no solemn &amp; fixed Rites;
I conceive the description of their en∣tertaining
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Envoy, may serve
<PB N="106" REF="61"/>
for a Specimen of their Carriage toward
all Persons of the like Character: which
take as follows.</P>
<P>The Envoy <HI>Don Diego Felippe de Pal∣ma,</HI>
having from <HI>Ceuta</HI> (a <HI>Spanish</HI> Gari∣son
on the <HI>Barbary</HI>-coast) advised <HI>Cidi el
Hader Ben Ali Gaylan,</HI> that he was come
from the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> on a Message
to his Excellency (that was <HI>Gaylans</HI> Ti∣tle)
and desired to know when and
where he should have permission and se∣curity
to deliver it: <HI>Gaylan</HI> returned
him answer, concerning the set Day and
Place for the <HI>Don</HI>'s Reception, which
was according to our stile, the tenth of
<HI>September,</HI> in the One thousand six hun∣dred
sixty third Year of Grace, and at a
place equally distant from <HI>Ceuta</HI> and <HI>Ti∣tuan:</HI>
where, to grace the <HI>Entrata, Gay∣lan</HI>
appointed a Parade of the best Horse
of his own <HI>Cavíla,</HI> and committed them
to the Conduct of his Brother <HI>Cidi Tobib
Ebn Ali,</HI> who march'd with them from
<HI>Arzíla</HI> to <HI>Tituàn,</HI> whither according to
appointment, <HI>Gaylans</HI> Father-in-law,
<HI>Almocadèm</HI> of the <HI>Cavíla</HI> of <HI>Angerà,</HI> had
sent his Sons with about sixty of their
Cousens, to joyn with <HI>Tobib,</HI> who with
<PB N="107" REF="61"/>
many more went to receive the Envoy at
the prefixed time and place: Where the
<HI>Moors,</HI> having paid him their Greetings,
they all March'd in this order.</P>
<P>In the first Troop came the two Sons
of the <HI>Almocadèm</HI> of <HI>Angerà,</HI> with about
sixty of their Kindred, all bravely mount∣ed,
and according to their Gallantry,
richly accoutred: These in several Rings
exercis'd the Lance with laudable Agi∣lity,
the Musick of <HI>Tituàn</HI> still playing
before them.</P>
<P>In the next rank came <HI>Cidi Tobit,</HI> at∣tended
with about fifty Horse, maintain∣ing
a very slow march, as if they intend∣ed
to revie or deride the Spanish Gravi∣ty.
Next to them rode the Envoy, <HI>Don
Diego Felippe de Palma del Habito de San∣jago,</HI>
with a single Trumpet sounding be∣fore
him: Next came led six stately Hor∣ses
trapt in blew Cloth: after them four∣teen
Mules loaden with Trunks; and in
the last place rode the Governor of <HI>Ti∣tuàn,</HI>
with the <HI>Alárbes</HI> Musick tinkling
before him, and attended with a large &amp;
well ordered Train. Vast multitudes
were flockt thither, having no other bu∣siness
but to gaze, being Strangers to such
a Procession.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="62"/>
In this order was <HI>Don Diego</HI> conduct∣ed
to his Lodgings in <HI>Tituàn,</HI> where he
courteously received the Christians that
came to give him the Parabien to <HI>Barba∣ry,</HI>
and declar'd a great readiness to
serve my Camrade and my self, whom he
knew had no other concern in those
Parts, but securely to travel and view
the Countrey. After two days refresh∣ment
at the <HI>Moors</HI> charge, the <HI>Don</HI> be∣gan
his march toward <HI>Arzíla,</HI> but first
caused the Horses to be richly trapt, and
led in State through the Streets of <HI>Titu∣àn;</HI>
which being done, they came into
a Plain a little out of the Town, where
the People made a spacious Circle, in
which the <HI>Moresco</HI> Cavalleres shewed
their active Horsemanship, and dexte∣rous
darting of the Lance; after which,
about fifty <HI>Negros</HI> and <HI>Alárbes</HI> began a
Dance, which they performed with plea∣sant
variety of Gesture, and strange A∣gility.</P>
<P>These Desports being finished, the
Envoy advanceth his Journey, and found
the ways crowded with Spectators, invi∣ted
thither by <HI>Gaylan</HI>'s Politick Friends,
who designed that the People might take
<PB N="109" REF="62"/>
notice of the Honor done to <HI>Cidi El Ha∣der,</HI>
and that his Friendship was sought
by one of the greatest of Christian Mo∣narchs.
But there were many that came
not so much to be Spectators, as to reap
the fruit of a common Report, that the
<HI>Don</HI> would cast great store of Realito's
among the poorer <HI>Moors.</HI> But their hopes
were deceived in the rumour of the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
Bounty, who did not herein de∣generate
from the Nature of his Nation,
which has ever been noted for a back∣wardness
to such insignificant Profusi∣ons.
The Envoy being safely arrived at
<HI>Arzíla,</HI> he was lodged in an Apartment
of <HI>Gaylan</HI>'s Place (pardon the Word)
where I leave him to lodge, and eat, if
possible, worse then he did at home.</P>
<P>The business and design of this Em∣bassy,
met with diversity of Conjectures:
by some it was supposed that <HI>Don Diego</HI>
was sent to sollicit larger Priviledges for
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Garrisons on the <HI>Barbarian</HI>
Coast. Others concluded that the Duke
of <HI>Medina Celi,</HI> envious at the Earl of
<HI>Tiveot</HI>'s successes against the <HI>Moors,</HI> and
his Truce concluded with <HI>Gaylan,</HI> caused
this Messenger (a Creature of his own)
<PB N="110" REF="63"/>
to be sent with Instructions, to interrupt
and disturb the new Correspondence
and Amity betwixt <HI>Tanger</HI> and <HI>El Hader.</HI>
But to find out the Riddle, I ploughed
with one of their own Heifers, having
employed a <HI>Moor</HI> versed in publick Af∣fairs,
(and recommended to me by that
great Lover of the English, <HI>Cidi Abdel∣erim
Nacsis,</HI> then chief Governor of <HI>Ti∣tuan)</HI>
who from the <HI>Spaniard</HI>'s inquisi∣tiveness
after the state and condition of
<HI>Tanger,</HI> the number of the Souldiers,
the quantity of the constant Guards, the
heighth and strength of the Walls, the
situation and number of the Guns ready
mounted, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with his Design in a <HI>Mo∣resco</HI>
habit to take a narrow view of the
whole place (which in <HI>Gaylan</HI>'s company
within few days after he performed) fil∣led
us with Jealousies that some mischief
was purposed against <HI>Tanger.</HI> And it is
very certain, That the fore-mentioned
Duke had an evil Eye upon the Immortal
<HI>Tiveot,</HI> for the Renowned Victories
which under the most Christian King he
atchieved against his Nations Interest in
the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> which aged Choler
he found highly inflam'd by the Victories
<PB N="111" REF="63"/>
gain'd by that <HI>indefatigable Captain</HI> over
his <HI>Moresco</HI> Neighbors, which instigated
the Dukes spleen not so much against
<HI>Tanger,</HI> as its Restorer <HI>Tiveot,</HI> who be∣ing
at this time in <HI>England,</HI> took the ad∣vantage
of his absence to disgrace him
(if any such thing had been possible) with
his new Confederate <HI>Gaylan.</HI> And ac∣quiescing
in this account of the Embassy,
I pursue my Province in setting down the
exact account of the present Customs
of the <HI>Moors.</HI></P>

<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Moresco Compellations, Re∣verence
to Superiors, Complexi∣on
and Conversation of the
Women, pious manner of saluta∣tion
and Stile.</HEAD>
<P>I Have not found any Nation so rude
and Barbarous, as to be utterly de∣void
of all <HI>Rites</HI> of Civility and Respect:
<PB N="112" REF="64"/>
for some tokens of honor &amp; kindness, some
terms of distance &amp; familiarity are used
by the most uncultivated. And the Moors
though they are very sparing in Comple∣ments,
yet they use both words &amp; gestures
of Respect. Towards all superiours they
indifferently use the Compellative <HI>Cidi,</HI>
which is as extensive as [Sir;] To wo∣men
of better quality they use <HI>Lala,</HI> sig∣nifying
as largely as <HI>Madam</HI> doth now
in <HI>England.</HI> And as to their outward
demonstrations of Respect, there is little
variation; for a grave inclination of the
body, with a putting the right hand first
to the heart, next to the forehead, and
then kissing the two foremost fingers laid
a cross the lips, is the exactest manner
of saluteing the Grandees; whose hand,
knee, or bottome of the Vest is kissed
by the Vulgar. Those that are familiar,
and of equal rank, at their first meeting
strike hands, but shake not, &amp; then lift
them up &amp; lay them to their breasts. And
their greetings are in the second person
singular, useing [Thou] to all from the
slave to the King: wherein they observe
the Eastern Custom. But in their addres∣ses
to their Prince no people can testify
<PB N="113" REF="64"/>
more signal tokens of Humbleness &amp; Pi∣ety,
for at the entrance into the Royal
presence, they bow their bodies to the
ground, saying, <HI>Sálam Allíg Allá En∣sorúck
Mulèy,</HI> Peace be to thee, God
preserve King <HI>Fuláno;</HI> &amp; these words &amp;
gestures are devoutly repeated at every
pace they advance toward the <HI>King.</HI> And
if any come with petitions they kisse, the
earth when they present them to his roy∣al
perusal. The like Reverences are dis∣charged
when they depart the <HI>Presence.</HI>
But I pass on to view the female Moors,
who if preserv'd from the injuries of the
Sun &amp; weather, are generally well comple∣xion'd
full bodied, &amp; of good symmetry.
Those that live in great Towns, together
with the wealthier sort in the Country,
are enclin'd to paleness, which may be
imputed to their sedentariness, or <HI>want
of motion;</HI> for they seldom stir abroad, ex∣cept
it be to visit the Sepulchers of
their deceased friends in devotion, to
pray for their felicity, and in the night
time to the Baths for health and cleanli∣ness.
As to their Friday-meetings I shall
speak of it in another Chapter. They
never step without the threshold but so
<PB N="114" REF="65"/>
closely vail'd, that no part is visible but
an eye. In the state of Matrimony their
principal studie is to please their hus∣bands,
to whom they are taught by their
<HI>Alcoran</HI> to bear a dutiful observancy, and
to omit no art that may render them de∣lightful
to their conversation. Those hus∣bands
that are able, allow their wives <HI>Ne∣gra</HI>'s
or <HI>black-women,</HI> to doe all the ser∣vile
offices in the Family; but yet there is
no quality that sits idle; for the cheif of
the <HI>Moresco</HI> Dames imploy their time in
some thrifty huswifry. And this pre∣vents
that custom of <HI>expensive gossippings,</HI>
with which in some <HI>Nations</HI> so many
wives are debauched, and husbands <HI>beg∣gar'd.</HI>
And yet the married women want
not their <HI>friendly conversations,</HI> for they
visit one anothers houses in token of
good <HI>neighbourhood,</HI> but without the com∣pany
of their husbands; no male though
he be never so much a relative, can be ad∣mitted
into their society. And to prevent
it, she that makes the visit first, sends to
know whether the husband be at home
if the answer be negative, then without
further ceremony she goes straight to her
Gossips apartment, where she is enter∣tain'd
<PB N="115" REF="65"/>
with a liberality that never injures
her husband; who if returning home in
the interim of the visit, is careful to give
no interruption, but upon notice quickly
departs the house; yet they give such
signals that he has bin there, as are easily
perceived by the <HI>Visitant,</HI> who thereupon
shortens the Visit, otherwise it common∣ly
lasts a whole day. But these being
offices that are seldome in their returns,
may justly be pardon'd in their length.</P>
<P>But foreseeing that I shall in another
place have occasion to speak again of the
<HI>Moresco</HI> women, I surcease to enlarge
the paragraph that here concerns them,
aud therefore proceed to view the <HI>pious
forms</HI> used by the Moors in their saluta∣tions
and Letters.</P>
<P>And indeed there is none that has had
any intimacy with the Moors in this
particular, but he might observe a great
appearance of Piety in all their custo∣mary
expressions. And this I learn'd
both from the discourse and practise of
those with whom I journy'd, who at
their setting out in the morning, would
with zeal and humility look up to hea∣ven,
and in a low voice say, <HI>Bismillah,</HI>
<PB N="116" REF="66"/>
that is, in the name of God; which is al∣so
done at the beginning of any labour
or travail. By which they intend that
nothing ought to be enterprised, but in
the power and hope of the divine favour
and help. And when the work or jour∣ney
is finished they say, <HI>Ham der illah,</HI>
Thanks be unto God; in which words
they deny all ascriptions of success to
themselves. When they meet one ano∣ther
upon the road, &amp;c. their greetings
at large is this thanksgiving, <HI>El ham dil∣lah
al salam tiqsi.</HI> i. e. God be praised
that I see thee well: but in passing by one
another the Salutation is usually this
prayer, if there be no more but one,
<HI>Salam alleq,</HI> if more than one, <HI>Salam al∣leq
cum,</HI> Peace be with thee, or you.
At the hearing of one another sneez,
they say, <HI>Era hanig allah, Dios tenga
V. M. en sumano.</HI> God be your keeper.
When one Moor goes to see another at
his house, the first that receives him saith,
<HI>Mar bába,</HI> or welcom, which if repeated
thrice, is an undoubted marke that they
are glad to see him; which kind re∣ception
he requites with saying,
<HI>Allah ellah miq</HI> i. e. God pay▪ you.
<PB N="117" REF="66"/>
And the like air and genius of Devoti∣on
and Piety is observable in those let∣ters
that the Moors write in their own
language; a tast whereof you have in
these two ensuing, translated out of <HI>Mo∣resco.</HI></P>

<P>Furthermore, to advise us of your a∣bundant
love, and especially generosity,
there came to us the worthy Gentlemen
your servants in their <HI>Ship,</HI> with the
honourable Commanders of it, the Con∣sul

themselves amongst us <HI>like Men,</HI> touching
your Command which they observed, and

And let God in our stead largly reward
and recompence you, who have so highly
obliged us herein.</P>
<P>Your Messengers staid with us for some
days, till we had performed some of their
desires, so that we sent along with them
two excellent horses and of the best sort
that hath been in our time, one whereof
was for our own Riding, and the other is of
the same breed; likewise forty good choise
beasts, both Bulls and Cows, and a flock
of about fourscore sheep, as a present to
your Excellency, which out of your Grace
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd favour, you would vouchsafe to ac∣cept
<PB N="119" REF="67"/>
from us. For the deserts and Me∣rits
of your Honour, God alone can recom∣pence.</P>
<P>We gave also to your <HI>Legates</HI> two spe∣cial
horses and a few Cattle as the time
permitted, and they likewise bought some
horses as the time served, and then de∣parted
from us well contented. But we
are alwaies with you in that inviolable love
and friendship, which neither distance of
place, nor length of time shall ever dis∣solve.
And as for our Country <HI>Barbary
(blessed be God)</HI> all of it that is <HI>loyal</HI>
and in <HI>obedience</HI> to us, whether Moun∣taines,
Plaines, or Citiès, you have free
passage into in love and friendship, to
converse and trade as you please, and to
manage all your affaires. And this
will be of great advantage unto us, if it
please <HI>God</HI> we live, and the General take
the Castle of the Port Town, and thè Reb∣bels
return wholy to their obedience, and
then you shall not apologise for us, or ex∣cuse
us in any service we can doe you. But
we request you to excuse us at present, as to
the rest of your desires, being assured that
we cease not to encounter and fight those
enemies which have broken Covenant with
<PB N="114" REF="68"/>
us, that so they may shortly (if God
please) return to their Allegiance.</P>
<P>And we intreat you to graunt our Ser∣vants,
the Inhabitants of the Port, your
best assistance in what ever they shall have
need of your help and supply. And what∣soever
of our <HI>Consorts</HI> shall come to you,
we beseech you not to be wanting in your
Care towards them.</P>
<P>But the most earnest and important bu∣siness
which concerns us to mention to you is,
for a great ship to lye at the <HI>Port</HI> betweeen
us and the enemy, on purpose to cut off all re∣lief
by shipping from the Enemie, and pray
let it be hastened with its fraught, pro∣vision
and all other necessaries. This is
our chief business which we entreat you
to accomplish, according to our desires.
And any of the Ships that shall come to
this Port, shall drive away whatsoever
Merchant ships they find there, and seise
their goods. For the only thing we are
wanting in, and in need of assistance, is this
business of the Merchants. Thus we have
given you the full of our desires in what
we have written. And let God accom∣plish
all your desires. Farewell,</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Moresco Entertainment, fashi∣on
of Travelling, Hospitals,
Diet, Reverence to Corn, for∣bidden
Meats.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Year of Salvation, 1663. <HI>Sept.</HI>
the sixth, at the going down of the
Sun, we came to an <HI>Aldéa</HI> called <HI>Angerà,</HI>
at the utmost Bounds of a Mountain of
that name; where we repair'd to the
House of <HI>Cidi Cassian Shat,</HI> whom we
found sitting at his Door, environ'd with
about twenty aged <HI>Moors</HI> of the Neigh∣borhood.
Alighting from our Horses,
we deliver'd our <HI>Segúra</HI> or Letters of
safe Conduct, to the Old Man; who
when he had perused, return'd them
with a grave Nod, the testimony of his
Approbation, and the signal of our Wel∣come.
This done, we were called to a
little upper Room, which we could not
enter till we had put off our Shoos at
the Threshold; not for Religion, but
<PB N="124" REF="70"/>
Cleanliness, and not to prevent our un∣hallowing
of the Floor, but defiling the
Carpets wherewith it was curiously
spread. At the upper end of the Room
was laid a Velvit Cushion, as large as
those we use in our Pulpits, and it deno∣ted
the most Honourable part of the
Room. After we had reposed about an
hour, there was brought in a little oval
Table, about twenty Inches high, which
was covered with a long piece of narrow
Linnen; and this served for Diaper. For
the <HI>Moors,</HI> by their Law, are forbidden
such superfluous Utensils as Napkins,
Knives, Spoons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Their Religion lay∣ing
down this general Maxim, <HI>That meer
Necessaries are to be provided for:</HI> which
caused a precise <HI>Moor</HI> to refuse to drink
out of my Dish, when he could sup Wa∣ter
enough out of the hollow of his
Hand. But this straitness has of late
Years begun to be enlarged, and the pro∣hibition
is interpreted to reach no far∣ther
then their Church-men, and chief
Ministers of Justice; so that those who
are able to provide handsome Furniture
for their Tables, have a Dispensation,
which they seem not prone to make use
<PB N="125" REF="70"/>
of, if the humour of the rest may be de∣vined
by that of this Grandee: At whose
House the Table was adorned as before,
and for Supper there was placed upon
it an Earthen Pot full of Mutton, Beef,
Cabage, Raisins, Potato's, Berengénas,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> all boyled together, and extream∣ly
hot with Dimicuto and Garlick, which
is their immutable Sawce. This hodge∣podge
was in imitation of the <HI>Spanish
Olla Podrida,</HI> excepting that it wanted
Bacon, an Ingredient so indispensible
to the <HI>Spanish Olla,</HI> that there can be
none without it, which occasion'd this
Proverb, <HI>No Sermon without St.</HI> Austin,
<HI>nor</HI> Olla <HI>without Bacon: Ny Sermòn sin</HI>
Agostino, <HI>ny</HI> Olla <HI>sin locino.</HI> But to pro∣ceed
in our Bill of Fare: our next Course
was a single Pullet cloven down the Bel∣ly,
with the four Quarters spread out at
large, by a way of Cookery peculiar to
the <HI>Moors.</HI> And these two Dishes, with
store of good Bread, made up the Feast.
Our Drink was strong Wine newly
brought from the Press, which stood by
us in a great stone Jar, with a sort of
wooden Ladle in it, out of which we
drunk. Our posture was laying round
<PB N="126" REF="71"/>
about the Table, according to the cu∣stom
of the Countrey. Our company was
the second Son of this Family, a debo∣nair
Gentile Person. Having supp'd,
and solaced our selves with muddy Be∣verage
and <HI>Moresco</HI> Music, we all compo∣sed
our selves to sleep: About twenty
were allotted to Lodge in this small
Chamber, whereof two were Christians,
three Jews, and the rest <HI>Moors:</HI> every
one made his Bed of what he wore, which
made our <HI>English</HI> Constitutions to wish
for the Morning, which no sooner ap∣peared
but we quitted our Lodging, lea∣ving
our Entertainer <HI>sans adieu,</HI> not tar∣rying
to return thanks for his Hospitali∣ty;
which could incur no displeasure, as
conforming to the stile of the Countrey.
And this Breviate of <HI>Cidi Cassian</HI>'s hospi∣table
House-keeping, is an Essay of the
rest, for the <HI>Moors</HI> have all one fashion of
living, and their Houses, Diet, and Ap∣parel
vary not, but in the matter.</P>
<P>Now that which makes Journying in
<HI>Barbary</HI> so full of Fatigue, is the want
of Houses of Publick Entertainment
(like the <HI>Venta</HI>'s and <HI>Posáda</HI>'s in <HI>Spain;</HI>
the <HI>Caborets</HI> and <HI>Hostelries</HI> in <HI>France;</HI>
<PB N="127" REF="71"/>
and Inns in <HI>England)</HI> whereby the Tra∣vellers
are constrain'd to carry their Pro∣visions
with them. The <HI>Moors</HI> usual Vi∣aticum
are Raisins, parch'd Beans, Ony∣ons,
Garlick, and store of Bread. They
rely upon the Fountains for their Drink,
which are kept in great decency and
cleanlyness: at every Fountain there be∣ing
a Dish made of Cork, fastned with a
string, out of which Man and Beast drink
for refreshment. Many of these Foun∣tains
are provided with a large smooth
Stone, whereon the <HI>Moor,</HI> after he has
perform'd his preparative Washing, ce∣lebrates
his <HI>Salla,</HI> or Orisons. And the
<HI>Bigots</HI> that live near these Fountains, e∣very
day repair thither to pay their <HI>Bi∣gotage,</HI>
or Superstitious Devotions.</P>
<P>They usually shut up their Journey at
the going down of the Sun; and if there
be an <HI>Aldéa</HI> or Village at hand, they turn
thither for House-room, and lodge com∣monly
in a Cotage, as mean as that
wherein <HI>Ovid</HI>'s aged Couple entertain'd

be suspected for bad Neighbors, the Tra∣vellers
watch by turns, and do the like
in places that are troubled with wild
Beasts.</P>
<P>When I said that the <HI>Moors</HI> have no
Houses of Accommodation, it was with
exception of the <HI>Almamóra</HI>'s, or Cham∣bers
maintain'd by the Revenues of the
Church, built on purpose to receive
Strangers of any Perswasion. These
Houses afford nothing but room to Lodge
in; but if it happen that Travellers are
in want of meat, the Villagers are ready
to supply them. The <HI>Alfaqúi,</HI> or Priest
of the place, hath Inspection and Super∣intendency
of these Hospitals. The
<HI>Moors</HI> have likewise peculiar Places, re∣sembling
the Infirmatories or <HI>Lazaret∣to</HI>'s
in other Nations, for those that fall
sick in their Journeys, whom they treat
with a laudable Care, till they either re∣cover
or dye: And if the infirm dye, not
leaving wherewith to bury him, there is
care taken for his Funeral, and a <HI>Mu∣láto,</HI>
or some baser <HI>Moor,</HI> is appointed
to beg the Alms of the place to defray
the Expence of the Strangers Interment.
In these <HI>Almamóra</HI>'s, the Stranger is per∣mitted
<PB N="129" REF="73"/>
to stay till the Weather and his
Health dispose him for his Journey: but
they repine at his abode, when it is not
urged by necessity.</P>
<P>In later Years, every Town of Tras∣fick
hath erected a sort of Inns, called
<HI>Alfandách,</HI> which affords nothing but
House-room for Man and Beast, the Mar∣ket
yielding Provision for both. Those
that farm these <HI>Fandáchs,</HI> cannot exact
above a Blankil a Night both for Man and
Beast, which is in sterling Money about
two pence. The Horses Lodging costing
equally with his Riders.</P>
<P>These <HI>Fandáchs</HI> were at first built by
the wealthier sort of <HI>Moors,</HI> who dying
in a pious humour, gave them to the <HI>Gi∣ámma</HI>
or Church, to hallow, say the <HI>Mo∣resco</HI>
Rabbies, the filthy lucre raised by
their employment. However, the <HI>Gi∣ámma</HI>
has its Revenues greatly augment∣ed
by such Donations. And whatever
was the Design of their Institution, we
find them of late under a great Degene∣racy,
being little better then Tipling
Shops, where the <HI>Moors</HI> Quaff the Fruit
of the Vine. But that which herein most
raised my Admiration, was to see the In∣comes
<PB N="130" REF="74"/>
of these <HI>Fandáchs,</HI> appropriated
to the maintenance of the <HI>Alfaqúi</HI>'s or
Priests, and that that Holy Order, ha∣ving
the disposal of such Houses, should
not see them under a more regular admi∣nistration.</P>
<P>But to go from these Publick Houses
to view the <HI>Moors</HI> in their private Roofs,
I find them in their Caresses frugal, with∣out
Parsimoniousness, and placing no
Character of good House-keeping in a∣bundance
of Viands. They have two
dishes in singular esteem, the chief where∣of
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nscussòn,</HI> which is made of Water
and Flower, or grated Bread, boyled
into a Consistence, into which they put
Butter, or any Kitchin-stuff: And this
they eat without Spoons; for when it is
ready, every one that is admitted to taste
it, dives into it with his hand, and dance∣ing
it in his Fist, till it be shap'd into a
Ball and cool'd, then casts it into his
Mouth. The other dish is known by the
name of <HI>Pillów,</HI> vulgarly pronounced
<HI>Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w,</HI> and it is the same with that which
I said has so near a resemblance with the
Spanish <HI>Olla Podrida.</HI> Besides these two
Dishes, the <HI>Moors</HI> of a better allay make
<PB N="131" REF="74"/>
their Breakfasts of <HI>Bonuélo</HI>'s, or small
Loaves boyled in Oyl, which they eat
with Sugar, or Honey.</P>
<P>The Countrey <HI>Moors</HI> feed much on
Milk, which they are by their Law for∣bidden
to taste, if it has been touch'd
by a Dog. They have store of Cheese,
but very course and homely. And as for
their Butter, we may suspect their clean∣liness
in making it; for they Churn it
in a Sheep or Goat skin, dressed or fit∣ted
for that office, which they shake be∣tween
their Hands.</P>
<P>But not much delighted with their
Dary-house, I leave it to observe their
Reverence to Bread and Corn, which is
both great and general, for from the
Throne to the Plough, if any see a crum
of the one, or a grain of the other cast
out, or scatter'd, he stoops to take it
up, kisseth it, puts it to his Fore-head,
and looking up, saith, <HI>Dill an, It is from
God;</HI> and then gives it to the first Crea∣ture
that will eat it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Moresco Giamma's, or
Churches: their Foundation,
Consecration, manner of Stru∣cture,
Subordination.</HEAD>
<P>ALL Religions in their first model
and Constitution have had some
less intelligible Articles and things of
a remoter signification, mingled with
their easier Doctrin's, and more obvious
Institutions. And there has ever bin
found a Catholique agreement, not on∣ly
in the main Article of the Deity, but
also in some solemne manner of his wor∣ship.
Upon which consideration there
were ritual circumstances established,
for the more decent celebration of Re∣ligious
Ministers. In the number of
which <HI>ritual Circumstances,</HI> I esteem <HI>a
dedicate place, Separate Time, solemne
Actions, Prescript Forms,</HI> and above all a
<HI>distinct Order</HI> of <HI>Persons,</HI> by whom the
Exteriot Religion is to be officiated, and
to whom for the Power &amp; Sacredness of
their Function there have ever bin de∣creed
<PB N="133" REF="75"/>
convenient Observances and Re∣venues.
How determinate the <HI>Alchoran</HI>
is in these particulars, falls not within
the compass of these remarkes, but it is
evident to those that attentively read it,
that the Author thereof seems not in a∣ny
thing to be definitive. But what ever
the mind was of that Impostor concern∣ing
the mentioned Rites, we find his
Sectaries have in all their Dominions
made Provision for Solemnity in their
Worship. Being guided thereunto ei∣ther
by the more lasting and regular
Principles of Reason, or in imitation
of some people of an other Perswasion,
which they esteem'd Wise and Delibe∣rate.
Nor can <HI>Mahumed</HI> be blamed for
not leaving Decretals in the Rights of
worship, because their nature is of so
great an indifferency, that no Religion
doth acknowledge them to be determi∣ned
in every particular by any Law,
meriting, or usurping, the title Divine:
neither is there any thing in themselves
to make them originally necessary.</P>
<P>And therefore without enquiring in∣to
the Motives by which the Moors or o∣thers
have been induced to the usage of
<PB N="134" REF="76"/>
the Accessories of Religion, I only ob∣serve
that the Moors are not therein de∣fective;
having Churches, Priests, Times,
Revenues, &amp;c. appropriate to the Di∣vine
Adoration.</P>
<P>I shall begin with their Giámma's,
Moschs or Churches in which this Coun∣trey
abounds, and to which the Moors
perform a great Reverence and libera∣lity,
never suffering them to be pro∣fan'd,
nor to want a competent stock
to keep them in repaires. The manner
observ'd in the erection of a new Gi∣ámma
is orderly and laudable, which
is thus: When a considerable Number
of People have agreed and resolved to
settle together in neighborhood, they
seek out a piece of ground convenient
for their purpose, which by mutual con∣sent
is divided, every family being al∣lowed
sufficient Room, whereof to
rear an habitation. This done their
next care is to set apart a spot of Earth
for the foundation of their Giámma,
with great regard that it have no consi∣derable
inequality of distance from their
several habitations. After they have
thus fram'd their Designe, the Giámma
<PB N="135" REF="76"/>
is first built, to which Holy work all a∣ges,
sexes, and qualities of persons con∣tribute
their labours Gratis, every one
valuing it for a peculiar felicity and ho∣nour
to have his hands and shoulders
wearied in such a sacred imployment.
The fabrick or Giámma being finish'd,
they dedicate it to no Patronage but the
Publique Worship, nor use any other
ceremony of consecration, but only
choose one that is able to read the <HI>Al∣coran,</HI>
whom they accompany to the new
Giámma, where some parcel of their
Law is read, and their Sallà's, or offices
perform'd, and from that time it is ac∣counted
a Holy place. And the Giámma
being thus raised to its full Stature, eve∣ry
family begins a Cotage for it self,
and when they are built, they seek for
an Alfaqui, or Priest, to Officiate in
their new Church, with whom they a∣gree
for a yearly Pension.</P>
<P>But we must restrain this custome of
building Churches to the <HI>Barabárs</HI> who
have fixed Mansions; for the <HI>Alárbs</HI> who
retain no place of constant habitation,
have for their Giámma a large Tent
standing exactly in the middle of their
<PB N="136" REF="77"/>
dwelling-Tents, whither they resort at
Canonical hours to their Orisons, in
which they are comformable to the o∣ther
Moors.</P>
<P>The Giámma's doe all agree in the
fashion of structure; being all long and
generally narrow, not running into
Iles, nor branching into Chappels and
Quires. Their situation is East and
West, without any windows at all, nor
have their Giámma's doores but on the
North-side. <HI>[They are without the too
easie accommodations of seats, Pews, or ben∣ches:]</HI>
the floor of the Giámma is hand∣somely
matted, and so are the walls a∣bout
two foot high. If the roof be large
and weighty it is supported with pillars,
among which hang the lamps, which are
kept burning all the night.</P>
<P>Every Giámma has a turret, on whose
top is placed a Crescent, or half Moon
(a <HI>Mahumedan</HI> Cognizance) from this
Turret the <HI>Almudén,</HI> or Sexton, with a
loud voice invites the People to Prayers,
which supplies the forbidden use of
Bells. The Moors keep their Giámma's
in a very Reverend decency, never per∣mitting
any dilapidations. None are
<PB N="137" REF="77"/>
vouchsafed to enter them but the Males
of their own Religion, which makes it
dangerous for Christians or Jews to
look within them; yet if this happens
they think not the Holy place to be
thereby any way desecrated. But this
signal respect to their Churches, renders
not their Devotions elsewhere perfor∣m'd,
to be invalid; yet if possible they
never faile to be at their Giámm's, attri∣buting
much to the Statary prayers made
in the Church.</P>
<P>In greater Towns there are many
Giámma's: in <HI>Tituàn</HI> fifteen, in <HI>Alcázar</HI>
more, in <HI>Arzíla,</HI> five, and in <HI>Fez</HI> seven
hundred. Among which there is a sub∣ordination,
for the <HI>Giámma Gheber,</HI> or
<HI>Great Giámma,</HI> being the <HI>Cathedral,</HI> or
Mother-Church, commands the rest, and
is the Cure of the <HI>Alcalib,</HI> or Chief-Priest.
To the <HI>Giamma Gheber</HI> all the
other Giámma's conforme in the houre
of publique offices, and though all the
rest are hung with Lamps, yet this has
one of a peculiar shape and quantity,
called Ettouria, or the Master-Lamp,
in testimony of the Chutche's Prelacy.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Moresco Priests, their edu∣cation,
Orders, Office, Reve∣rence
of the Priest, Revenue,
the Almudén, Penalties for
absence from the Giámma's.</HEAD>
<P>THe Moors have at this day no
Schools of Science, like the Eu∣ropean
Universities and Colledges;
which may be a main reason of their
Growing stupidity and Barbarism; for
the want either of leisure, or lack of op∣portunity
to study Arts and Sciences,
because their whole time is spent in
gaining whereon to live, through a
deficiency whereof the politest Nations
will soon degenerate into ignorance
and rusticity. As for the Colledge call'd
<HI>Amarodóch</HI> in <HI>Fez</HI> (whose structure
cost King <HI>Aba Henen</HI> 480000 Crowns,
and which has been so amply celebra∣ted
for the Concinnity of its building,
delightfulness of scituation, carved roof,
<PB N="139" REF="78"/>
Mosaic Arches and brazen gates) it is
now wholly destitute of Students. And
if the Moors were not carefull to keep
up great store of Petty Schooles, they
would soon decay and fall into a total
illiterature. In these Petty Scholes the
<HI>Alfáqui,</HI> or Priest, takes in the first rudi∣ments
of his Learning, without any pos∣sibility
of climbing higher than to write
and read; and if a Youth be found to∣wardly
and capacious, and bearing a
good affection to the Priesthood, when
he has arriv'd to the first forme in the
School, he is removed thence, and placed
with one of the best learned <HI>Alfàqui's</HI> in
the Town, or <HI>Cavíla</HI> where the School is
kept. And this new Tutor instructs his
Pupil to read the <HI>Alcoran</HI> with perspicu∣ity,
and to understand the principal
points it containes: The Tutor likewise
informes him of all the Rites of the Gi∣ámma,
which being both few and easy,
are quickly obtain'd; and when the
Schollar is deem'd competent both for
age and Learning to be a Priest, then
his Institutor call's two or three <HI>Al∣fáquis</HI>
more to examine the Candidate,
who being found deserving, they grant
<PB N="140" REF="79"/>
him Testimonials of his willingness and
abilities to be an <HI>Alfáqui:</HI> And this is
all the education and Orders, which I
could observe to be bestowed upon their
Priests. But it is very remarkable, that
among the Moors none are admitted to
this Holy Dignity, but such as are of a
competent age, and marryed; for the
former they render this reason, a No∣vice
ought not to be admitted to the
Priesthood; but I conceive that their jea∣lousie,
with which they are notoriously
gifted, is the fittest account can be gi∣ven
of the later.</P>
<P>The Moors suffer no Giámma to be
vacant, because they esteem an <HI>Alfáqui</HI>
to be altogether necessary to exteri∣or
Religion; and that Common Persons,
or the Laity, performing the solemn
offices of Religion, doth make them com∣mon.
For Holy Rites are no more to
be dispensed by all, than the secular
Laws; and though all men have common
Interest both in Religion &amp; the Laws,
yet all cannot be Administers of either.
And upon this consideration, that in the
Combinations and Communions of men
Religion cannot subsist, without some
<PB N="141" REF="79"/>
to guide, officiate, and prescribe the
ministeries thereof, the Moors are dili∣gent
to provide an <HI>Alfáqui</HI> for every Gi∣ámma,
that there may be no vacancy,
nor omission in the service.</P>
<P>To the <HI>Alfáqui</HI> the Lay-Moors pay a
signal Reverence, giving him the more
honourable hand, and place. They
plough his ground, dress his vineyard,
reap his Corn, &amp;c. to the end that by no
secular cares he may be interrupted in
his Function; And by this I am guided
to look into the office of the <HI>Alfáqui,</HI>
which is first, to preserve the Giámma in
decency, and to provide that the stru∣cture
be not dilapsed, &amp; that the Lamps
and matts be duely supplyed. But the
Priest never puts his hand to any ser∣vile
work, having those under him upon
whom all the drudgery is discharged.</P>
<P>The second part of the <HI>Alfáqui</HI>'s of∣fice
is, to inspect the Institution of the
children; to which purpose he hath u∣sually
under him, one that is fit for the
toyle, and reserves to himself no more
but the examination of the Childrens
proficiency, which he doth once a week;
and those whom he finds remiss, receive
<PB N="142" REF="80"/>
his Correction, but the diligent, the
marks of his approbation. They have
no free Schools, but pay a weekly salary
to those whom the <HI>Alfáqui</HI> doth appoint
to teach, for none can be a School-Ma∣ster
without his Licence and approof.</P>
<P>His next care is to take notice who
absent themselves from the Giámma,
having power at his own discretion to
punish whomsoever he observes to be
therein delinquent. He is very vigilant
to assist the sick, whom dying he accom∣panies
to the Grave. If there happen a∣ny
disagreement among the Neighbours,
the <HI>Alfáqui</HI> mediates a reconcilement,
but if the Quarrel exceeds ill language,
and be concerning <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Tuum,</HI> he
is not permitted to intermeddle.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Alfáqui</HI> dislike his Cure, he hath
liberty of removall, being not confin'd
to any <HI>Parochial</HI> Giámma above a year,
and he seldome contracts for a longer
space. And for that time he is the Su∣perintendent
of the <HI>Mosch,</HI> out of whose
Rents he defraies all the Charges for
Reparations, &amp;c. takeing the surplu∣sage
for himselfe.</P>
<P>And now the remarke passeth to the
<PB N="143" REF="80"/>
Revenues of the Giámma, which chiefly
arise from the Donatives of the dead. In
some places the Incoms are very large,
in all comfortable; for the Moors ex∣ercise
a great benevolence to places de∣dicated
to Religion: whereby they re∣proach
many stiled Christians, who cast
aside the least sheaf for the Tenth, and
who are so far from enlarging the Church∣es
Patrimony, that they are ready to
devour the pitiful Remainder that she
still enjoyes.</P>
<P><HI>Muley Mahumed,</HI> in his third Com∣mandment,
enjoynes his <HI>Musalmim</HI> Li∣berality,
and Alms-deeds, which pro∣ceeding
from goods honestly gotten are
according to the <HI>Alcoran</HI> meritorious of
Paradise. He likwise prefers private
Almes before the publick, and declares
the Devil to be an inplacable enemy a∣gainst
this expression of mercy. And in∣deed
there are many such pious do∣ctrines
in the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> but they are but
as so many good eares of corn in a good
field of Tares, or as so many single grains
lost in a heap of chaff: it having been
the subtilty of the old Serpent in all a∣ges,
to guild over his poysonous Pills,
<PB N="144" REF="81"/>
and to blend Truth with falshood, that
the latter might be embrac'd for the sake
of the former. Besides it is an ancient
mistake to think, that Truth and falshood
are of too great a contrariety and di∣stance
to mingle and concorporate;
which makes many when they have found
some truth in Doctrine, to conclude no
falshood to be joyned with it. And those
truths which are dispersed up and down
in <HI>Mahumed</HI>'s Law, being evident to its
Professors, make them credulous of the
whole system. And though they are
zealous for all the precepts, yet for
none more than that which concernes
Alms-deeds; for they have their <HI>Asho∣ràh</HI>
which is an Anniversary Festival,
whereat they bestow a certain quanti∣ty
of their Substance upon the Poore.
But the greatest Bounties are towards
the Giámma, to which every one at his
death leaves a Portion of his estate, by
which method the Giámma has conside∣rable
endowments, which are under a
continual improvement, and made ca∣pable
of no manner of Alienation.</P>
<P>To every Giámma there belongs an <HI>Al∣mudèn,</HI>
or a kind of Sexton, whose of∣fice
<PB N="145" REF="81"/>
is to call the people to Church at the
houres of prayer; which he doth from
the top of the Turret (mention'd a∣bove)
crying with a voice articulate
and loud, <HI>Illáh Ghebèr, God is the great;</HI>
and sometimes, <HI>Lailláh La Mahumèd Re∣súl
allá.</HI> There is but one God, and <HI>Ma∣humed</HI>
the Messenger of God. And these
words the <HI>Almudèn</HI> pronounceth at e∣very
corner of the Turret, beginning
at the East, and ending at the point that
looks toward <HI>Mecha;</HI> by which they si∣gnify,
that all the corners of the world
should look towards <HI>Mecha</HI> in worship∣ing
the Deity, that is be <HI>Mahumedans.</HI></P>
<P>The next office of the <HI>Almudèn</HI> is, to
open the doores of the Giámma, to trim
the Lamps, and keep the matts in repair
and cleanliness. He also informes the
<HI>Alfáqui,</HI> who hath an inherent power
to punish those who can show no good
reason of their absence.</P>
<P>But the penalty is very tolerable, be∣ing
no more than five or six pounds of
<HI>Cuscussòw,</HI> which the offender brings to
the Giámma, where it is eaten by the
Priest and the Assembly. None are found
to offend therein through contempt, or
<PB N="146" REF="82"/>
wilfulness, nor yet through the pursu∣ance
of their pleasures; for there is so
strict an observance of the Church-ser∣vice,
that the husband will leave the socie∣ty
of his wife to be there, if he hears the
<HI>Almudèn</HI> speaking the <HI>Invitatory.</HI> The last
branch of the <HI>Almuden</HI>'s office is to dis∣miss
the people, which he doth at the
end of the Salla, or Orisons, in the same
words that he called them together. And
now before I close up this chapter, I
cannot, speaking of their Ecclesiastique
penance, but observe that the Moors have
no such thing as excommunication, so
that they are for no crime debarr'd the
Giámma; but on the contrary the grea∣test
mulct inflicted by the Priest is for
their absence, above three times in twen∣ty
four hours, from that Holy Place.</P>

Church-Musick.</HEAD>
<P>THe Moor's season of Prayers re∣turns
five times in twenty four
hours, or a Natural day; The first is,
<HI>Alowilíc Sbah,</HI> and comes about Noone;
The second they call <HI>Allahiric Luli,</HI>
which is about three a clock in the after∣noon;
The third <HI>Ateltháh Asèr,</HI> at the
going down of the Sun; The fourth <HI>A∣larbèe
Ashá,</HI> a little within night; The
last, <HI>Alhamsáh Magnib,</HI> which is in win∣ter
a little before day. At every assem∣bling
the Prayers are the same, except
that at the <HI>Allahiríc Luli</HI> they repeat the
<HI>La illa Ghehèr</HI> but thrice. The Moors
esteem the prayers made in the Giámma
to be of the greatest efficacy, and there∣fore
all endeavour to performe them
there, but those who cannot repair thi∣ther,
doe discharge this duty, where
<PB N="148" REF="83"/>
the solemn houres find them</P>
<P>In their addresses to these Holy cele∣brations
the Moors use great tokens of
reverence, being very punctual in fitting
themselves for the Giámma. Their ge∣neral
preparative consists in washing;
which is such a necessary right, that
without its observation it is impossible
to be of their Religion. And it is no∣torious
to all acquainted with the <HI>Ma∣humedan</HI>
Institutes, that Washing is a
great part of that Law; nor need this
create any man's wonder, seeing that
all the <HI>Musalmim</HI> of the <HI>Alcoran</HI> use
washing in a mystic signification of in∣ternal
purity, and that the soul receives
the benefit of their corporeal Lavors.
None among them returne from natural
evacuations, but they wash the parts li∣able
to defilement, nor will any who is
a Virtuoso in the Ceremomies, eat with
unwasht handes: which at first I Inter∣preted
a mere Civil Cleanliness, because
they use no knives, &amp;c. but tear their
viands in pieces with their fingers,
but upon farther scrutiny I perceiv'd it
to be reckon'd by the superstitiosi a∣mong
the Actions of Religion.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="83"/>
In places where they have hot Bathes
(which are in few places wanting) they
use them after concubinate, and all im∣provident
pollutions; but their greatest
exactness in washing, is at their going to
prayer. Then every part where nature
disburdens her excretions, is warily
cleansed, and the other parts also which
are more egregiously obnoxious to pollu∣tion.
If any Moor after he has washt
at home, in his way to the Giámma
chance but to belch, he dares not enter
the Holy r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>of of untill he has us'd the lo∣tion.
And therefore in the foundation
of a Giámma, great care is taken that it
may stand near some spring, or recepta∣cle
of water, that those who come to
the Church, may be provided with that
element in case of any contingent de∣filement,
without the trouble of return∣ing
home to wash.</P>
<P>When they come to the door of the
Giámma, every one puts off his shooes at
the threshold, and then enters with a
slow pace, erect body, and eyes bash∣fully
looking towards Heaven: in this
posture they advance directly to the
southside of the Giámma, and they al∣ways
<PB N="150" REF="84"/>
make their prayers toward that
point, because in all their devotions they
are commanded to make them toward
<HI>Mecha.</HI> While they are in the Giámma
none dare openly to yawne, Cough, walk,
discourse, spit, scratch his head or face,
but if any has need but to wipe his lipps,
he doth it unseen, covering his counte∣nance
with his <HI>Alheìc,</HI> which is a loose
garment generally worn by the Moors.</P>
<P>And by these Reverences in their
Carriage toward Holy places and Per∣formances,
they are taught to upbraid
the Christians, whose behaviours at sa∣cred
solemnities some of the Moors have
observ'd to be of a far different character.
And this I learned from a Moor who had
unluckily been in England to make the
animadversion, with whome when I dis∣cours'd
about this point, he told me
with anger and indignation in his looks,
that it was a shame to see women, Dogs,
and dirty shooes, brought into a place
sacred to God's worship, and that men
should walk and discourse in a <HI>Mosch,</HI>

that they should have Chaires there to

home: which with other actions of the
like irreverence he zealously repeated to
reproach the Christian. And indeed I
was not furnisht with arguments to
(nor could in conscience) excuse any
considerable part of his Animadversion:
only I told him; That as for the exclu∣sion
of Women from the publick offices
of the <HI>Mosch,</HI> it was a doctrine of the <HI>Al∣coran,</HI>
grounded upou conceits of imper∣fection
peculiar to that sex, which are
not so far to be own'd, as for them to ex∣clude
the females from the meanes of
their chiefest felicity. Besides this ex∣communion
of women, was an Article of
Interest and Policy, and which <HI>Mahu∣med</HI>
adopted into his Religion on pur∣pose
to complease the Jew, who at this
day begins his publick Prayer with a
thanksgiving to God, <HI>que no le hizo mu∣ger,</HI>
that he did not make him a woman,
a creature not allowed to serve him in
the Synagogue, &amp; that seeing we wanted
reasons which moved the Moors to this
practice, we could incurr no scandal by
its rejection. As for his objecting our
bringing Dogs into the Church, I told him
it was an uncomely and irreverend per∣mission
<PB N="152" REF="85"/>
&amp; wholly abhorr'd by knowing.
Christians; that there was a Provision
made against it, and that it had been his
ill hap to look into a Church, where the
Sanction in that particular met with a
remiss execution. Next, as to our ha∣ving
seates in the <HI>Mosch</HI> (for I was to
speak in his own dialect) and to sit at
some parts of Divine service, Custom
and innocent convenience were all
that any one could pretend to hollow
it. But as for walking in the Church
in time of Divine Service, or therein
at any time to discourse of secular con∣cernments,
that it was only the pra∣ctise
of profane and ill disciplin'd
minds, the miscarriage of the rude,
contrary to the Rule, and a certain ar∣gument
of a relaxed Discipline and neg∣ligent
Superintendent.
<Q>Pudet haec opprobria—.</Q>
But I return to the <HI>Giámma,</HI> whither the
<HI>Alfáqui</HI> comes not till a considerable
number of the People are assembled;
who in the Priests absence spend their
time in a devout repetition of the <HI>Sal∣lah,</HI>
<PB N="153" REF="85"/>
a Word that signifies the whole
Form of their Prayers. And when the
<HI>Alfáqui</HI> is come, he advanceth straight to
the South-side of the <HI>Mosch,</HI> and the
People fall orderly into ranks behind
him. Upon this the Priest begins the
Prayer in a Voice moderately elevated,
which the People humbly repeat after
him. At the pronouncing of <HI>Illah El
Gheber,</HI> that is, <HI>God is the great,</HI> they
all use an Elevation both of Hands and
Eyes to Heaven: at the name of <HI>Mecha,</HI>
they all kiss the Ground; but when they
mention <HI>Muley Mahumed,</HI> and the Mer∣cies
he procures them, they fall prostrate,
and upon the sudden, in a kind of Ra∣pture,
reassume an erect. When the
Priest hath repeated <HI>la illah Mahumed
Resul Allah</HI> four times, the <HI>Almuden</HI> dis∣misseth
the People. And when they
leave the <HI>Giamma,</HI> the <HI>Alfáqui</HI> goes first,
as a token of his Prelacy above the Peo∣ple.
Their <HI>Salláh</HI> or Service is very
short, for if it took up any considerable
time, the frequency of its return would
take up most of their leisure, and there∣by
be a sensible impediment to their
Temporal Vocations.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="86"/>
In the closure of this Chapter, I
thought to have spoken something of the
<HI>Moresco</HI> Musick in the <HI>Mosch,</HI> but this I
found to be a delightful piece of Devo∣tion,
wherein they seem to be very igno∣rant.
I have been told, that in former
time they had in every <HI>Giámma</HI> some
Lay-persons, that understood the <HI>Ca∣dences</HI>
of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and which could
sing it in its Original Metre, which must
needs be very harsh Harmony, if any at
all, in regard of the incapacity that is
in the <HI>Alcoran</HI> Language to fall into Syl∣labical
Measures and Tuneable Propor∣tions.
Besides, the <HI>Moors</HI> have very
harsh and sawing Voices, as they will
have cause to observe who have had their
Ears grated with their Amorous Son∣nets,
in which all are wont to express
their sweetest and best moving Accents.</P>

<P>SOme have laid it down for a great
Reach in <HI>Muley Mahumed,</HI> that he
reserv'd the Church-Government to
himself and his Successors: Which is still
visible in the Grand <HI>Seignior</HI> and the
<HI>Sophi;</HI> for albeit the one hath a <HI>Mufti,</HI>
and the other a <HI>Mustard-Dini</HI> to inspect
the Ecclesiastick Affairs, and to be as
the Oracular Interpreters of the <HI>Mahu∣medan</HI>
Law, yet their Election is incom∣municably
in themselves. And albeit
that these Principal Church-men are had
in so great esteem with their Princes,
that their Decisions are scarce ever con∣tradicted
<PB N="156" REF="87"/>
by them, yet when their De∣terminations
are not consistent with the
Interest of the Publick, these great O∣racles
are dismist, and others introduc'd,
who are not so scrupulous in their Sen∣tences.
By which it is evident, that the
<HI>Mahumedan</HI> Princes are in effect the
Heads of the Church, and chief Expo∣sitors
of Religion. But not much of
this can be observed in the <HI>Moors</HI> Church-Government,
who have in every <HI>Cavíla</HI>
(or County) an <HI>Alcalib,</HI> or High-Priest,
in whose nomination the secular Power
doth not at all interpose, for he is cho∣sen
out of, and by the <HI>Alfaqùis,</HI> over
whom he is invested with a Power, where∣by
he is enabled to Depose, or otherwise
Chastise the Offending Clergy. Imme∣diately
upon this Arch-Priests Election,
he is possess'd of the <HI>Giámma Gheber,</HI> or
Great Church: Wherein upon every
Friday he Expounds some Text of the
<HI>Alchoran,</HI> unto which Exercise he always
goes accompanyed with the chief Per∣sonages
of the Neighborhood. And being
enter'd the Church, he immediatly as∣cends
the <HI>Albambár</HI> (which is a Bench a∣bout
five steps from the Ground) with a
<PB N="157" REF="87"/>
tall Staff in his Hand, wherewith he of∣ten
beats upon the Bench to express his
Zeal, and to awaken the People to a
more signal attention to what he then
delivers. This Discourse, Homily, Ex∣position,
or Sermon, exceeds not an hour
and a quarter in length, and is deliver'd
exactly by heart. And when it is end∣ed,
the <HI>Almuden</HI> dissolves the Congrega∣tion,
and the <HI>Alcalib</HI> returns to his House
accompanyed with the chief of the place,
and in his passage he receives the custom∣ary
Tokens of respect from the People.
And whatever some Cursory Review of
this Countrey tell us of the other Priests
making Sermons to the People, yet ha∣ving
with some diligence made enquiry
into this particular, I found that the Of∣fice
of Preaching was peculiar to the <HI>Al∣calib,</HI>
or Chief-Priest, and that no Ser∣mons
were celebrated at any other
Church, but at the <HI>Giámma Gheber</HI> (that
which I may English the Cathedral.)
This eminent Church-man is seldom seen
in Publick, but at this Exercise; for to
make himself the more Reverenced he
affects retirement, spending his hours in
the study of the <HI>Alchoran,</HI> and in resol∣ving
<PB N="158" REF="88"/>
such Cases as the Layity present
him, who esteem his Resolutions infalli∣ble.
And this, with a careful Inspection
into the deportment of the Inferior
Clergy, doth constitute the Office and
Government of the <HI>Alcalib.</HI> As for his
Revenues, they are suitable to his con∣dition:
and as to his Life, it is austere
and reserv'd, he affecting a peculiar Gra∣vity
in all his carriage. Every <HI>Alcalib</HI>
has his distinct Diocess, out of which
he has no power, so that the <HI>Alcalib</HI> of
<HI>Beni-Arós</HI> hath nothing to do in <HI>Minkél,</HI>
for every one is absolute in his own <HI>Ca∣víla.</HI></P>
<P>At the publick Instructions of the <HI>Gi∣ámma,</HI>
none are present but the Males,
for the Women, as I said, are denyed
admission into the Assembly, yet are not
wholy destitute of the means of being
taught Religion: for upon every Friday
they repair to the House of the <HI>Alfaquí,</HI>
where his Wife is bound to Instruct
them: But her Lectures usually concern
good Houswifry, and how they should
demean themselves to their Husbands, in
Obedience and Submission, and to live
in Peace with their Fellow-wives. All
<PB N="159" REF="88"/>
the while the Women are at the Priests
House, he is not to return home, nor
stir out of the <HI>Giámma,</HI> but hath his
Meat brought him thither. But for what
reason the Priest should be under this re∣straint,
I leave any one to imagine, who
has heard of the <HI>Moresco</HI> Jealousie. But
now in case the Priest has no Wife, who
seldom wants four; or that by any In∣disposition
she is not able to perform this
Office, then it is discharged by some
aged Matron of the place: and for a fur∣ther
supplement of the Womens being
debarr'd of the <HI>Giámma,</HI> their Husbands
repeat unto them such Lessons as they
have heard there. And this is all that
on this account I could observe of the
<HI>Moors</HI> Women.</P>
<P><HI>Muley Mahumed</HI> styled Prayer the Key
of Paradise, and the Pillar of Religion,
that he might the better recommend its
practice to his Converts, who generally
maintain so careful a performance of this
Duty, that no secular business can detain
them from, nor any thing divert them at
their Devotion. I once endeavor'd to
collect their Prayers into an Order, the
better to take a distinct view of this Pil∣lar
<PB N="160" REF="89"/>
of their Religion, but I found them
reduced to no certain Form extracted
out of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> but were a Collecti∣on
of some incoherent Sentences mag∣nifying
the Power and Mercy of God.
Their first Prayer, or rather their Creed,
is that which the <HI>Almuden</HI> Proclaims with
a loud voice, when he calls the People to
the <HI>Mosch;</HI> as there is but one God, and
<HI>Mahumed</HI> his Messenger: and this admits
of no variation. The second Prayer is
the first Chapter of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> where∣in
there is some difference according to
Translations (in which the <HI>Alcoran</HI> hath
been very unhappy) but those which I
have seen in <HI>Latin, Spanish,</HI> and <HI>French,</HI>
agree in this Traduction of the Cha∣pter.</P>
<P><HI>In the Name of God, Gracious and Mer∣ciful,
King of the Day of Judgment: thou
art He whom we adore: it is from Thee
that we require help: guide us in the right
way, in the way of those with whom Thou
art pleased, against whom Thou art not
angry, and we shall not go astray.</HI> This
Prayer is repeated with the former, af∣ter
the same manner as the Papists re∣peat
their <HI>Pater noster</HI> with the <HI>Ave Ma∣ria:</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="89"/>
For the <HI>Moors</HI> have their <HI>Tesserae
Precariae,</HI> or their Beads, wherewith
they number their Prayers. And the
whole <HI>Corona</HI> or <HI>Rosary</HI> consists of nine∣ty
eight, which the <HI>Devoti,</HI> or Religi∣ously
affected, carry always about them.
They have a Custom to repeat often to∣gether
the first Words of the Prayer,
which they conclude to be a great act of
Charity, as supplying by this Repetition
the defaults of such as are remiss in this
duty.</P>
<P><HI>In the Name of God, Merciful and Gra∣cious,</HI>
is the Proeme of every Chapter in
the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and were the first Words
that <HI>Mahumed</HI> is said to have spoken
when he came out of his <HI>Epileptick</HI> Fits,
which he made the People believe were
Trances. And with the same Words
the <HI>Mahumedan</HI> Doctors begin all their
Discourses, and the Letters written in
<HI>Moresco</HI> Language, if the Pen-men are
precise, are likewise introduced in the
same Form. There is a Learned Man,
that tells of a Prayer among the <HI>Mahu∣medans,</HI>
which is called, <HI>The Prayer of
Jesus the Son of Mary,</HI> ending thus, <HI>And
let not such an one bear rule over me, that
<PB N="162" REF="90"/>
will have no pity upon me, for thy mercy
sake, O thou most merciful.</HI> But having
diligently enquired, I could not find
that the present <HI>Moors</HI> have any such Le∣tany
in their Uses. There are few who
are able to read, that want Manuals of
Private Devotions, which are composed
by the <HI>Morabito</HI>'s or <HI>Morabouts,</HI> and are
indeed rather to be termed Charms, then
Prayers. Now these <HI>Morabito</HI>'s or <HI>Mo∣rabouts,</HI>
are a sort of <HI>Alárbes</HI> which are
skilled, or so pretend to be, in the Law
of <HI>Mahumed,</HI> severe in their Conversa∣tion,
bearing a great ostentation of San∣ctity,
pretending to Prophesie, or Pre∣dictions.
They compose all sorts of
Charms, to which the <HI>Moor</HI> is so addict∣ed,
that he has one for every occasion:
I have seen a whole Book thereof, con∣taining
some for the Child-bearing Wo∣men,
to facilitate their Travel; some
for the Passenger, to guide him in the
way; some for the Soldier; and one
for the Horse, which is much in the Ser∣vice
of the Saddle: This they hang un∣der
the Beasts Neck, and believe that it
keeps him from being blind, or dim∣sighted.
They have likewise Spells to
<PB N="163" REF="90"/>
keep their Cattel healthy, and make
them fruitfnl, all compos'd by the <HI>Mo∣rabouts</HI>
and Priests; the latter, of late,
being much given to this sort of Compo∣sures.</P>
<P>And now from these short Notices of
the <HI>Giámma</HI> and its Appendages, I pass
to speak of the <HI>Moresco</HI> Sabbaoth. That
the fifth day of the Week, is the Weekly
Festival of the <HI>Mahumedans,</HI> to distin∣guish
them from the <HI>Jew,</HI> who keeps the
sixth according to our account, and from
the Christian who observes the se∣venth,
is known unto every one that
knows any thing of this subject. About
the Institution of this Sabbaoth, varie∣ty
of Opinions may be met with: For
some derive its Original from the vene∣ration
<HI>Mahumed</HI> bore to the New Moon,
which is said to have appeared on Fri∣day,
the same day he began his Impo∣sture;
and in memory of so happy an
abodement, he set apart this for Solemn
Worship. There is another Conjecture
which fetcheth its Institution from some
Heathen Rites paid on this day to <HI>Ve∣nus,</HI>
whose name Friday bears. But
there is little ground of this Opinion,
<PB N="164" REF="91"/>
further then it may well suit with the
Genius of <HI>Mahumedism,</HI> to have a day
Sacred to the Goddess of Carnality. But
that Opinion herein seems best to agree
with the Chronicles of <HI>Mahumed,</HI> which
makes his escape from the Conspiracy
of the Nobles of <HI>Mecha,</HI> to have been
the occasion of this Sabbaoth, from
which deliverance the <HI>Mahumedan Hegi∣ra</HI>
had its Original and Name. And in
this <HI>Mahumed</HI> undoubtedly imitated the
Ancient Christians, who took their <HI>Ae∣ra</HI>'s
from some notable Persecutions.
But whatever was the Original of this
Sabbaoth, I observ'd that it has no great
marks of Reverence above other days:
for on it the <HI>Moors</HI> go to Plough, hold
their Markets, open Shops, and omit
little of their Ordinaries, so that I must
retract my calling of it a Sabbaoth.</P>
<P>They indeed on this day have an Ex∣position
at the <HI>Giámma Gheber,</HI> and on
it they put on their whitest <HI>Alheics,</HI> dress
their Locks, and are seen in their best
Accoutrements. The Women likewise
on this day visit the Sepulchres, and
and strew the Graves of their deceased
Friends with green Boughes and Herbs.
<PB N="165" REF="91"/>
And this is all that I have been able to
remark upon this subject.</P>

<P>THe <HI>Moors</HI> have no Judicatories, or
Publick Houses where they assem∣ble
about Judicial Controversies; nei∣ther
have they any Mercenary Advo∣cates,
or profess'd Lawyers, but all is
decided by an <HI>Alcaddée,</HI> who is appoint∣ed
by the Supreme Ruler to be the Mi∣nister
of Justice in the <HI>Cavíla,</HI> and Town
where he lives. Now every <HI>Cavíla</HI> hath
a peculiar <HI>Alcaddée,</HI> from whom they
cannot Appeal to any other but <HI>Alcaddé
Gheber,</HI> or the chief of these Justices,
<PB N="166" REF="92"/>
who is appointed to receive such Ap∣peals,
and is in constant attendance up∣on
the King, or chief Governor. But
it is not permitted to use these Appeals,
except in Causes which are supposed to
be too difficult for the Decision of the
Local <HI>Alcaddées;</HI> and when the matter
is of that Importance that the Parties
are unwilling to acquiesce in the solita∣ry
Sentence of one single <HI>Alcaddée.</HI></P>
<P>These Justitiaries take no state of re∣tirement,
nor do they weary out the
poor Clients with tedious Attendances,
but to signifie the facility of access, and
their readiness to relieve and succor the
Oppressed, these <HI>Alcaddées</HI> sit in the
Gates of the City, or some open and
Publick place, to hear and determine all
Cases that are brought before them.
And albeit that this manner of doing Ju∣stice
be conformable to the Custom of
the greatest and best Antiquity, as also
very significative of open &amp; clear deal∣ing;
yet the <HI>Moor</HI> renders another rea∣son
thereof, and that it is to avoid all
Suspicion and Jealousie of corrupt Car∣riage
in the <HI>Alcaddée</HI> with the Female
Plaintiffs that sollicit him for Divorces.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="92"/>
Every one of these Local <HI>Alcaddées</HI>
has two Assessors, who in abstruser
Pleas assist him with their Counsels: But
the chief Employment of these Sides∣men,
is to Copy out the Sentences of
the <HI>Alcaddée,</HI> and to draw up all the
Contracts that come to be confirm'd by
him; for there is no bargain esteem'd
Legal and Authentick, till it be certifi∣ed
under the Hand and Seal of the To∣pical
<HI>Alcaddée.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Moors,</HI> as all other <HI>Mahumedans,</HI>
acknowledge the <HI>Alcoran</HI> to be the Im∣mutable
Rule both of Civil Justice and
Religion, and therefore according to
the Letter and Interpretation thereof,
the <HI>Alcaddée</HI> frames all his Definitions
and Judgements. Here's no Intreaguing
the Plea with Resolutions, Cases, Pre∣sidents,
Reports, Moth-eaten Statutes,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> But every thing is determin'd ac∣cording
to the fresh Circumstances of
the Fact, and the Proof of what is al∣ledg'd.
The Testimony of two Men,
if they are of known sobriety, is suffi∣cient
to make good the Allegation; but
there must be twelve to ratifie it, if their
Conversation be suspected: for the
<PB N="168" REF="93"/>
<HI>Moors</HI> believe, that amongst twelve Men
as much honesty may be met with, as will
equal what can be found in any two. If
any <HI>Alfaquí</HI> or Priest be introduced to
give evidence to the depending Contest▪
his bare Affirmative or Negative deposi∣tion
is of validity to put a period to the
Dispute, and the <HI>Alcaddée</HI> supersedes all
Enquiry, when the Priest hath declared
the state of the Cause. And in this, as
in all other Instances, they give a Reve∣rend
Estimation to their Priests, whose
Presence secures the Civil Disquisitions
a great Veneration with the Many.</P>
<P>In taking the Testimony of a Moore
upon Oath, the Servant of the <HI>Alcaddée</HI>
carries the Deponent to the <HI>Giámma</HI> or
<HI>Mosch,</HI> where in the presence of the <HI>Al∣caddée</HI>
he swears by that holy place, that
he will declare all what he knowes con∣cerning
the matter, to which he is to
give Evidence. But oaths are never ad∣ministred
to any in another man<HI>'s</HI> Case,
but such as are suspected Persons, and
they are usually numbred among the
Rogues, and faithless, who have no
Credit without them; Besides it is ne∣ver
permitted for a man to swear in his
<PB N="169" REF="93"/>
own Case, but for want of Witnesses,
or when the Accusation is of that na∣ture,
that the Impeached cannot other∣wise
Receive Purgation. As for the
Christian, and Jew, they are suffer'd to
give Testimony according to the Rites
and Customs of their own Religions, but
the Moors, are not forward to put them
upon this Tryal, as doubting that fear
of Punishment, should tempt them
to perjury, and those who are thereun∣to
accessory (according to the <HI>Moresco</HI>
Principle) are involv'd in the Guilt.</P>
<P>In Pleas of Debt, it is required that
the Reality of the Debt be first manifest,
which being done before the <HI>Alcaddée,</HI> he
signifies it to the <HI>Almocadèm</HI> of the <HI>Ca∣víla</HI>
where the Debtor lives, who upon
his Signification, commandes a present
payment to be made; but if the Debtor
refuse or be unable, to give the Cre∣ditor
Satisfaction, the <HI>Almocadém</HI> Re∣mits
him to the <HI>Alháb's,</HI> or Prison (which
is alwaies near the <HI>Almocadéms</HI> house)
where he stayes till bayled thence by
sufficient Sureties, or Personally payes
the debt.</P>
<P>And to secure their Courts of Justice
<PB N="170" REF="94"/>
from interfering, or clashing oue with
another, the <HI>Alcaddée</HI> of one <HI>Cavíla</HI>
may not intermeddle with any thing
that is transacted in an other, but eve∣ry
one moves orderly in his own Sphere,
and confines his proceedings within
the Punctual Limits of his Assigned Ju∣risdiction.
And that herein there might
be no Collusion, Covin, or Imposture,
every <HI>Alcaddée</HI> has his Privy Seal, where∣with
he firmes the contract, or other
things that pass under his hand. And the
Seal is usually engraven with the name of
the <HI>Alcaddée,</HI> and Place of his Office. And
yet notwithstanding this care to prevent,
they have the Villany of forging deeds,
which is done by some skill'd in the <HI>Al∣caddé</HI>'s
office. But upon detection he that
produces the forged Paper is immediatly
imprison'd, and remaines without hope
of enlargement, till he declares the For∣ger,
and after that the <HI>Alcaddée</HI> puts up∣on
him a pecuniary Mulct; but he deall's
much more severly with the Principal in
his Forgery, who for the first Convi∣ction
receives a sharp repremend from
the <HI>Alcaddée,</HI> and after that the <HI>Almo∣cadém</HI>
is order'd to burn his house; but
<PB N="171" REF="94"/>
if he be found to repeat his offence, the
Forger dyes without mercy; which just
rigor secures them from the mischiefs of
counterfit writings to the prejudice of
anothers Right. So that this is a Villa∣ny
through the whole world condignly
punished; and by our own Laws, a se∣cond
forgery of Deeds concerning ano∣thers
Land after a former Conviction,
is Felony.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Moresco punishments of For∣nication,
Adultery, Thievery,
Retaliation, Murder, Bribery,
Ʋsury, Alcadée's Revenue, Opi∣nion
of the Jews.</HEAD>
<P>IN the <HI>Moresco</HI> Catalogue of Crimes,
Adultery and Fornication, are found
in the first Comma, whose difference in
the Moors Opinion may be collected
from their Penalties. For Adultery, it
<PB N="172" REF="95"/>
is allways Capital, insomuch that with∣out
regard of any Eminence or Quality,
the Convict thereof is certainly ston'd
to Death, which is done with most
notorious Circumstances. For first the
day of Execution is published, then the
Criminal is brought to the <HI>Calvary,</HI>
where bury'd up to the navel in a <HI>Mat
Móra,</HI> or a pit digged for that purpose,
every one present casts one stone, and
no more, at him, saying, this is for thy
filthy transgression of the Law; but if
the Adulterous be Persons of Condi∣tion,
their Friends have Licence to dis∣patch
them privily, to prevent the o∣pen
reproach to their family.</P>
<P>In the punishing Fornication they
are less Rigorous, as finding the mis∣chief
thereof not to be of so large a de∣rivation,
as that of Adultery. And if
the Persons convict of this Unchastity
are in the state of <HI>Coelibate,</HI> they are on∣ly
Chastis'd with Scourges: but if either
be married, or under matrimonial con∣tract,
Death is the certain penance. But
the Moors are no less solemn in whip∣ping
the Fornicator, than in Stoning
the Adulterer. For on Friday, after
<PB N="173" REF="95"/>
the Arch-Priest has ended his Lecture,
the Offender, if a man, is placed at the
great door of the Giàmma <HI>Guebèr,</HI> or Ca∣thedral
Church, naked down to the mid∣dle,
and in the presence of the Congre∣gation
receives an hundred stripes on his
back from an Officer appointed for that
Purpose, who has a certain number of
<HI>Blankéles</HI> (or <HI>Moresco</HI> twopences,) for his
Service; the Moors as they passe by the
chastised, use these deprecatory words,
<HI>Allah Iffecni min had El ham.</HI> i. e. God de∣liver
me from this wicked fellow. The
woman who hath been partner in the
filthiness, suffers her punishment in the
night, when she is whipt through the
streets, but with more severity than the
man, because the Moors suppose the Fe∣male
to be of a predominant allure∣ment
in such unclean commixtures.</P>
<P>The Moors who live in a Roaving
condition are much addicted to Thieve∣ry,
against which the <HI>Alcaddée</HI> proceeds
by these steps of punishment; for the
first Theft the Convict is publickly
whipt in the <HI>Alsóuck</HI> or Market; for the
second, he looseth his hand; for the
third theft he may truly be said to dye
<PB N="174" REF="96"/>
<HI>without mercy.</HI> For the Moors observe
<HI>Caligula</HI>'s Severity in making the Of∣fender
exquisitely sensible of his death,
which they inflict. Against the day of
the Theif<HI>'s</HI> Execution, the Youth of the
Place are advertis'd to prepare their
Instruments of blood, which are little
dry Canes, made in the fashion of darts,
accurately sharp pointed, these they
hurle at the naked body of the Malefa∣ctor,
till his whole skin be struck ther∣with
full of holes, and when they find
him sinking under the torture, they
dragg and hang him up by the heels up∣on
a gate, or the like, where he breaths
out his last in torments, and being dead
he is loathsomly exposed to the birds of
prey.</P>
<P>In bodily injuries they observe the
law of Retaliation, as an Eye for an Eye,
a tooth for a tooth, &amp;c. but it is in the
power of the maimed party to Receive
a pecuniary reparation, or without any
satisfaction to remit the wrong; but this
is not permitted til the matter hath been
tryed before the <HI>Alcaddée,</HI> and the hurt
party publickly declared, that he is wil∣ling
either freely to forgive the injury,
<PB N="175" REF="96"/>
or to accept so much money in full Re∣paire.</P>
<P>And however the Municipal Laws of
some Countreys put a vast difference
between murder and man-slaughter,
as appeares in their defin'd punish∣ments,
yet in <HI>Barbary</HI> all homicide, or
killing of a man by a man, is Capitall.</P>
<P>And the Moors have herein two con∣cessions.
The one is to Licence the next
kindred of the slain, to take money for
his blood of him that spilt it. The o∣ther
to permit the Relations of the mur∣dered
to kill the murderer, without a∣ny
judicial proceedure, if he be not al∣ready
in safe custody; which is no more
then a pursuance of that Position, Re∣venge
is no sinne. Of this there happen∣ed
a famous Instance, not many months
before I left <HI>Barbary,</HI> an account where∣of,
as it was given me by my old freind
<HI>Cidi Alli Mulud Ben Ali,</HI> take as follows.</P>
<P>A Moor of <HI>Targa</HI> not far from <HI>Tituàn</HI>
having his Brother treacherously mur∣der'd
by one of the Voisinage, under∣took
to pursue the fugitive murderer,
with designe to avenge his Relations
blood, and coming to <HI>Alcazer Gheber,</HI>
<PB N="176" REF="97"/>
he was inform'd that the Person he sought
for had some days before been there,
and that he had put on a Pilgrims habit,
with full resolution to pay a holy jour∣ny
to <HI>Mechà;</HI> upon which the Pursuer
put on the like habit, and in prosecu∣tion
of his design purposed to per∣forme
the same pilgrimage; bnt being
come to <HI>Morocco,</HI> he overtook &amp; lodg'd
with the murderer in the Pilgrims hos∣pital,
where early the next morning he
slew him; whereupon being apprehen∣ded
and examin'd upon the fresh cir∣cumstances
of the fact, he produced a
Certificate under the hand of the <HI>Alcad∣dée</HI>
of the place where he liv'd, that his
Brother was slain, and that he had un∣dertaken
to avenge his death, the mur∣derer
being fled, and likewise answered
them, that that was the Homicide whom
he had killed, whereupon he was set at
liberty, and the Corps left to his dis∣posal,
to which giving a decent Inter∣ment,
he returned home to receive the
praises of his Gallantry.</P>
<P>But to return to the <HI>Alcaddée,</HI> whom I
shall here only observe in his Revenue,
and office; as to the former it is very
<PB N="177" REF="97"/>
considerable, for he signs not a paper
without a Fee; and as to the latter, it is
very honourable, and careful, for all ci∣vil
affaires pass through his hands, and
he dayly sitts attending on all qualities
of persons without varying his respect
to any. If he be corrupt in his Charge,
the <HI>Alcaddée Gueber,</HI> upon mature convi∣ction
turns him out of Office, which is
his extremest penalty.</P>
<P>But indeed the Ministers of Justice
have no opportunity to be Collusive, as
being free from the great allurement of
dealing falsly, for Bribery is not known
amongst them. Usury which (I promi∣sed
to intimate in this Chapter) is tota∣ly
forbidden by their Law, for <HI>Mahumed</HI>
hath made it an irremissable sinne, and
the Userer in as bad a condition as the
Divell, leaving him neither will, nor
hope to be saved.</P>
<P>Yet notwithstanding the severity of
the Law, and the supposition of this
Crime, the Moors have a Custom
which much favours it; for he that bor∣rows
mony of another wherewith to
trafique and gain, gives the lender an e∣qual
share of the Profits, and in case the
<PB N="178" REF="98"/>
borrower lose the whole Principal, he
is obliged to make it good to him that
lends it, but if only part be lost, the re∣mainder
is employ'd to regain it. And
it is usual with the lender to forbear the
Borrower, till he perceives him fraudu∣lent,
Careless, or Unfortunate.</P>
<P>And because the sinne of Usury is so
notorious among the Jews, the Moors
believe that for it they are oppressed of
God, and live Exiles from their own <HI>Ca∣naan.</HI>
But it is easy to observe a sort
of Antipathie between these people, not∣withstanding
that they are conjoyned
in neighbourhood, commerce, &amp; in very
many rites both civil and Religious. But
the contempt is reciprocal, for if the
Moor by way of Proverb say, <HI>As deceit∣ful
as a Jew,</HI> the <HI>Jew</HI> repayes, as <HI>uvbe∣lieving
as a Moor.</HI> And this enmity I
remarked in a <HI>Barabár</HI> of my Acquain∣tance,
who observing the Jews very much
frequent my lodging, he very roundly
reprov'd that Conversation, and angri∣ly
told me, That the Jews were born
to cheat both the Moor and the Chri∣stian,
that he was assured that they were
not descended of <HI>Adam,</HI> but that they
<PB N="179" REF="98"/>
were breed of the bone of a dead beast,
and when he conjectured my incredulity
of his ridiculous Story, by my smiling
thereat, he told me in angry zeal, that
he would pledge his head for the truth
of his Assertion; whereupon I demand∣ing
what he conceived of those Jews who
turned Moors, he answer'd, that there
was such efficacy in their religion, that it
made all those good who embraced it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Moresco opinion of Marriage,
manner of woeing, marriage-So∣lemnity,
carrying home the
Bride, Offering wedding-feast.</HEAD>
<P>THat marriage is honorable among
all men, if it were not a truth dropt
from an inspired Pen, might be proved
by Induction, and the oecumenical con∣sent
of all Nations, which pretend to
any setled Rites in Religion or Policy.
As for <HI>Mahumed,</HI> he had matrimony in so
peculiar an estimation, that he made it
the second of his eight Precepts, and
<PB N="180" REF="99"/>
enjoyn'd every Subject of his Law to
marry in the Vigor of his Age, making
the predominant end thereof, the Pro∣pagation
and maintenance of his Sect.
He likewise told them that chast celibate
was impossible, and that those who pre∣tended
to live therin, were justly to be
suspected for unclean conversation. And
hence perhaps it comes to pass, that
the Moors (who are the Puritans in
Mahumetism,) are so generally observant
of this commandment; for few among
them are found to live out of the state of
Wedlock, if they are able to purchase
a wife. But many are not very prone
to take all the liberty in marrying indul∣ged
them by their Prophet; for albeit
he permits them plurality of wives, yet
there are several families that for many
ages have confin'd themselves to one: &amp;
I have met with those who abhor that
filthy position father'd upon <HI>Muhumed,
That the more they are spiritual, the more
liberty and abilities they have to be car∣nal.</HI></P>
<P>Unto the persons that are to be mar∣ried
there is no conversation permitted
till the Knot be tyed, so that both par∣ties
<PB N="181" REF="99"/>
take one the other upon trust, and
the man perchance never sees the wo∣man
till they be brought to the bride-chamber;
A custom that would be ve∣ry
hardly disgested by the Utopians,
who think it very unreasonable that a
man should take a wife with less scru∣tiny
than he doth his horse, and that he
should bring one to be the perpetual
partner of his life, with less informa∣tion
than he doth a horse to his stable,
which he may part with the next day.</P>
<P>But the Contriver of the New <HI>Atlan∣tis</HI>
findes all these inconveniences avoi∣dable
by the custom of <HI>Bensalem:</HI> where
(saith he) neare every Town there
is a couple of Pooles (which they call
<HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eves</HI> Pooles;) in these it is
permitted to one of the Friends of the
man, another of the woman, to see them
severally both naked. And the Moors
have a custom not much differing from
this of <HI>Bensalem,</HI> for upon the design of
marriage two of the man's Female
friends, who have lived long enough in
wedlock to understand its <HI>Perquisites,</HI>
are appointed to view the intended
Bride, and to give the Suitor an account
<PB N="182" REF="100"/>
of her bodily accomplishments, and de∣fects,
which is exactly entered in the
Contract, and if any infirmity be con∣cealed
for which the husband afterward
disliks her, he may put her away; and
this makes them very cautious to omit
nothing in the search or report; But
there is no such examination passed up∣on
the man, because he is dayly expo∣sed
to a free Censure.</P>
<P>If this Inquisition be pass'd with sa∣tisfaction,
then they proceed to frame
the Articles of Marriage, which is al∣waies
done by the nearest Freinds or
Relations of the Parties to be contract∣ed.
And when they have finished them,
they are brought to the <HI>Alcaddée</HI> to be
confirm'd under his hand and Seal; for
unless the bargain be thus ratified, the
woman in case of her husband's death,
or her own divorce, cannot recover the
Portion that was promised her, or ra∣ther
the price that was to be pay'd for
her by the man; For I suppose that
few are ignorant of the <HI>Moresco</HI> Custom
of buying their wives; When the Paper
containing the Bargain has passed the
<HI>Alcaddée,</HI> it is carried to the <HI>Alfaquì,</HI> who
<PB N="183" REF="100"/>
having perused and declared his ap∣probation
of its Contents, he bids
the Man take home the Woman when he
pleaseth to be his Wife; and this is all
that is done by the Priest in this, ac∣cording
to their Estimate.</P>
<P>And after this short dispatch of Woo∣ing,
Contract, and Marriage, the Bride-Grooms
next consultation is with his
own convenience in order to fetch
home his Bride: in which the warm
Clime suffers him not to be tedious. But
herein he is obliged to observe the ap∣pointed
Times; for neither all Weeks
in the Year, nor all Days in the Week,
nor all hours in the Day, are free for
this Solemnity. For the taking home
the Bride is altogether prohibited du∣ring
their <HI>Ramadàn,</HI> or Lent: The like,
Prohibition reacheth unto the Tuesdays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays of every Week,
and on the Canonical or Regular Days,
the Afternoon and Evening are the ac∣customary
Hours. At the time when
Marriage is Celebrated, they use all pos∣sible
significations of Joy and Hospita∣lity;
and it is the Custom for the Friends
of the Marryed to contribute something
<PB N="184" REF="101"/>
to grace their Nuptials. Therefore if
the Marryed Pair live both in the same
Town, then at their set time the Bride∣groom
goes attended with his nearest
Kindred, who coming to the Lodgings
of the Bride are not suffer'd to go in,
but wait at the Door till the <HI>Negra</HI>'s,
which the Husband hath bought or bor∣rowed
for that day, bring the Bride
from her Chamber under a Canopy of
<HI>Alhéicks,</HI> and place her in an <HI>Almaria,</HI>
or close Chair (much resembling a Tub)
which they cover with Scarfs and Ri∣bons.
And in this manner she is born
through the Streets by Christians that
are Captives, and for want of these by
<HI>Negra</HI>'s, or by a meaner sort of <HI>Whites.</HI>
When they begin their March from the
Brides House to the Bridegrooms, the
Musick, Colours, and Drums pass in the
first rank; next to them go some anci∣ent
Women, who have been a long space
Marryed, all closely veil'd: immediate
next after the <HI>Almaria,</HI> or Bride-Chair,
march those who carry the Clothes and
Presents of the Bride, which have been
made her by her Friends, who follow
immediatly after in a regular disposi∣tion.
<PB N="185" REF="101"/>
When they are come to the Bride∣grooms,
the Chair being lighted, the
<HI>Negra</HI>'s take out the Bride, and under
a Canopy of <HI>Alheicks</HI> conduct her to
her Apartment, where she is received
by some aged Matrons, who instruct her
in the important Offices of a good Wife,
and the rules of that Relation, but they
are wary of betraying any discouraging
Severity, and therefore intermit their
Documents by tasting the good Cheer
provided for their Entertainment. While
the Bride is thus caressing the Matrons,
and receiving their Maternal Councels,
the Bridegroom entertains his Com∣rades,
Feasting them with the best <HI>Cus∣cussone,</HI>
and brisk Wines, if their over
scrupulousness debar them not the
chearfulness of that Beverage. But the
Bridegroom is not licensed for that time
to drink freely of any strong Liquor,
for Reasons not worth the mention∣ing.</P>
<P>In the interim of this Entertainment,
the Batchellors make a kinde of Offer∣ing
to their Wedded Companion; in
which they observe this Method: The
Bridegroom placeth himself upon a lit∣tle
<PB N="186" REF="102"/>
low Seat, behind him stand two <HI>Ne∣gro</HI>'s
bending his Head moderatly back;
then come the Batchelors, who cover the
Bridegrooms Fore-head and Brow with
<HI>Metacales</HI> (or single Coins of Gold)
and <HI>Blankéles,</HI> according to their Af∣fection
and Ability: and as they lay
them on, the <HI>Negro</HI>'s stroke them off in∣to
a Basin set for that purpose in the
Bridegrooms Lap, who all the while
shuts his Eyes. The <HI>Negro</HI>'s likewise
call every one by name who Offer, say∣ing
<HI>Fulano</HI> (or such an one) lays on so
much, God enlarge his Life and Riches.
And this continues till all the Batchelors
have been at the <HI>Corban.</HI> About eight
of the Clock the Company breaks up,
with resolution to reassemble the next
Morn; and when they are gone, the
Bridegroom visits the Bride, whom he
undresses with his own Hands, first ta∣king
off her Ornaments, then untying
her Drawers, and in every point pre∣pares
her for his Bed; none being ad∣mitted
to assist, or to be present at this
Office. And this they say he doth, in
signification that she is wholly and only
at his disposal.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="102"/>
Some <HI>Conocido</HI>'s or intimate Asso∣ciates
of the Bridegroom, stay behind
the rest of the Company to congratu∣late
the first Pleasures of his Marriage.
For about Mid-night he leaves his Bride
to manifest unto his select Companions
the evidences of her Virginity, by Tradi∣tional
Arguments authentick with the
<HI>Moors.</HI> This good News they all cele∣brate
with increase of Jollity; and now
they venture to warm the Bridegroom
with his own Fires, and endeavour to
return him to his Bride crown'd with
his own Vine. But if she yield not
these Testimonies of Virginity, it is in
his power to put her to death, or other∣wise
to dispose of her as he pleaseth.
For they esteem that the most unpardon∣able
sort of Cozenage, which takes a
Mans self and his Money for that which
is impossible to be made good. And
those Women are accounted egregiously
impudent, who conscious of their own
Failures dare put themselves upon this
adventure.</P>
<P>But if for this Injury he returns her
to her Friends, she meets with that ri∣gour
at their hands, which she might
<PB N="188" REF="103"/>
easilier have undergone from her Hus∣band;
for all her Cozens think them∣selves
dishonored in the Debauchery of
their Kins-woman, which they imagine
cannot be expiated but either by death,
or some more durable Purgatory. And
by reason of this just Severity, the <HI>Mo∣resco</HI>
Damsels are very cautious of their
Behaviour, and scarce in half an Age
hath any one been convict of this Delin∣quency;
however, the Man is circum∣spect
not to omit the Ordeal.</P>
<P>When the Bridegroom and Bride have
refreshed themselves apart with their
choice Companions, all are dismist till
the next day; when the Festival is re∣assumed,
and lasts a considerable time;
the Wedding Feast of the poorest conti∣nuing
a Week. And for this time the
new Marryed Man has a priviledge to be
absent from the <HI>Mosch</HI> without fear of
mulct. Some Grandees are not seen a∣broad,
from the day of their Wedding
till they can shew the Pledge thereof in
their Arms. But these are bound to
have a Dispensation from the <HI>Alfachi</HI>
for their absence from the <HI>Mosch,</HI> and
to observe the Times of Prayer in their
Chambers.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Moresco Polygamy, Concu∣binage,
Divorce, for what reasons,
in what cases it is allowed.</HEAD>
<P>THat the <HI>Muley Mahumed</HI> might the
better complease the loose humors
of his first Sectaries, he made his Reli∣gion
to contain many carnal indulgen∣ces,
denying nothing to Believers of his
Doctrin, that had any sensible comply∣ance
with their brutal affections. And
of this we meet with an Example in his
concession of Polygamie and concubi∣nage;
for first he granted to every Pro∣fessor
of his Religion the liberty of mar∣rying
four wives; he likewise taught
that they might take as many Concu∣bines
as they were able to maintain, but
in this also the more illuminated Moors
confine themselves to one of their own
Perswasion, esteeming Concubinate with
Infidels (under which name all are com∣prized
<PB N="190" REF="104"/>
that profess not <HI>Mahumatism)</HI>
to be an unexorable uncleanness. As
for Polygamy it is looked upon as a Di∣vine
Institute, and when any object a∣gainst
it, the Moors vindicate it by the
frequent examples and universal cus∣tomes
thereof, in the Patriarchs and
worthies of the Hebrew world. And
I could meet with none who asserted Plu∣rality
of wives upon politick conside∣rations,
as that it was coveinent for the
propagation of the Empire, encrease of
people, and enlargement of their Re∣ligion:
but that it proceeded from God,
was used by the Holiest of his Servants,
and the oeconomy of the Old Law.</P>
<P>When the inconvenience of these Plu∣ralitie
is objected, and that their Oeco∣nomicks
cannot but be much disorder'd
by reason of the inquietudes, and strifes
that will inevitably arise among so many
female corrivals for one man's affection;
they tell you that this is a disease whose
remedy is of a very easy procurement,
by reason of that absolute Dominion,
which the husband hath over his wives,
whom, if they prove disagreeing, he con∣fines
to their several apartments, with∣out
<PB N="191" REF="104"/>
allowing them any further conversa∣tion
among themselves, then that their
society at meales affords them. And if
this will not cure the unpeaceable hu∣mour,
then Divorce proves an infalli∣ble
Receit; of which give me leave to
give this briefe account.</P>
<P>When the woman findes herself aggrie∣ved
by her husband, or any of her fellow-wives,
her only reparation and succour
is to seek a divorce. And in this case she
has liberty to address her self to the <HI>Al∣caddee,</HI>
who has the sole power of dissolv∣ing,
as well as of tying, the knot of ma∣trimony.
And when the woman has de∣clard
her condition, and spread before
the <HI>Alcaddee</HI> the reasons upon which she
grounds her desire of Divorce, the <HI>Al∣caddee</HI>
presently sends for the husband, &amp;
examines him concerning the verity of
the complaint brought against him by his
wife, if he deny it, then the matter is
decided by the voice of the Neighbours,
but if the husband have a willingness to
be quit of his wife, then he needs but
confess that whereof he is accused, and
the <HI>Alcaddee</HI> teares in pieces the Bill of
their marriage which he had Confirm'd,
<PB N="192" REF="105"/>
declares the Marriage void, and certifies
the Divorce under his Seal; and from
hence forward they are both at liberty
for new nuptials. From which the wo∣man
is bound to abstain till it be appa∣rent
that she is not impregnate by her last
husband, who is still obliged, to provide
for the issue that she shall bring into the
world five months after the Divorce.
But if she cannot tarry so long, then the
<HI>Alcabla,</HI> or Midwife, has her in Exa∣mination,
who is bound to return a just
&amp; true report upon pain of being stoned
to death. The Moors call the Divorce
and widdows by the same word, and en∣joyn
them the same Laws of second mar∣riage.</P>
<P>The chief causes of Divorce on the
womans part or either disquiet and fro∣ward
carriage to the Family, especially
when she will not live in amicable socie∣ty
with the Sharers of the same Bed: or
when she is unpleasing to her conjugal
embraces, or when she will not indure
his familiarity with his women slaves.
But if she be found guilty of adultery,
the injurie is too great for Divorce to re∣pair
and in this Case she is solely left to
<PB N="193" REF="105"/>
the pleasure of her husband, who has
Absolute power both to be her Judge
and Executioner. And albeit the Moors
are not sparing in the revenge of their
kinreds death, yet they applaud the
husband who kils their kinswomen,
whom he has certainly found treache∣rous
to his Bed.</P>
<P>The occasions of Divorce on the hus∣bands
side are his refusal of paying his
wife marital Due; or, some other sort
of unkind deportment. But after all
the wives complaints, the husband is at
liberty to retain or put her away; and
he may at any time divorce his wife in
case he will make good the marriage
Contract.</P>
<P>It is usually said, that the wives seek
for Divorce when their husbands deal
unnaturally with them; and albeit this
is said to be done with a great deale of
modesty, the crime being signified by
the turning up of a Shooe, yet in <HI>Barba∣ry</HI>
examples of this kind are very unu∣sual,
for the Moors abhorre the villany,
believing that it is not in man's Nature
to be so preposterous; and that it
was at first the malitious invention of
<PB N="194" REF="106"/>
some vile and impudent Strumpet.</P>
<P>The Children which are begot before
Divorce, follow not the woman, but are
left to the husbands charge. And it is
observable that the <HI>Moresco</HI> women sel∣dome
prove unfruitful, for in a town of
above twelve hundred married women,
it was reckon'd for a great rarity that
there was one dyed barren. But the
wife, different from the Jewish custom,
suffers no dishonour for her Sterility,
and if the husband takes a second wife
who proves also childless, the husband
beares the imputation. <HI>Mahumed</HI> in the
fourth Chap. of his <HI>Alcoran</HI> adviseth the
husband whose wife is barren, to swear
by her belly, and asserts it a means to
make her Conceive. A devotion which
as I have been told is still in use among
the <HI>Alárbes,</HI> but quite worne out of
fashion with the other Moors.</P>
<P>In the nursing of Children the mother
abhors that unnatural pride of suckling
them with other brests, while her own
are sufficient for that affectionate ser∣vice.
And to shew that there is some∣thing
more than common kindness in
this particular, the Empress her self is
<PB N="195" REF="106"/>
obliged for the first seven days to give
her child suck.</P>
<P>And now before I dismiss this re∣mark,
I cannot but acquaint you with
all the material ceremonies, of the se∣cond,
third, and fourth marriages. E∣very
former wife upon the introduction
of another, lives seven days deprived of
all manner of society with her husband,
who for that time devotes himself en∣tirely
to his last Bride; whom on the
seventh day after marriage he solemnly
brings into the acquaintance and fellow∣ship
of his other wives, whose brows the
last married is bound to kiss, and tells
them that they are not to be angry that
their Holy Law hath entitled her to a
share in his affection as large as any of
theirs. The husband likwise exhorts
them all to reciprocal kindnesses, as∣suring
them that without fraud, or any
partiality, he intends to divide himself
among them.</P>
<P>Now that which seemes most nearly
to concern the wives, and proves the
greatest and most incentive of their
wrath is their husbands liberty of taking
as many Concubines as he lists; which for
<PB N="196" REF="107"/>
the most part are Blacks, the Moors
doting much on that Spanish saying <HI>la
Negra tiene, turmentina en ella.</HI> But
those that keep Concubine slaves, are
not permitted to associate with them in
the night, and if any of them bear, their
Patrons Children, she thereupon re∣ceives
her liberty, and the Child is co∣heir
with those begot in Wedlock.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Moresco admission of Rene∣negados,
Circumcision, Imposition
of Names, Sur-names.</HEAD>
<P>EVery Religion have had still some
Rites appropriated to the admission
of such as undertook its profession; and
by which they were characterized and
distinguished. Concerning this the Au∣thor
of <HI>Mahumatism</HI> was much distract∣ed,
not knowing what inaugurating ce∣remony
to Ordain. His two assessors
<HI>Sergius</HI> the Monk, and <HI>Abdalla</HI> the Jew,
divided him with their opinions, while
each pleaded for the character of his
<PB N="197" REF="107"/>
forsaken Faith. But the wary Impostor
(labouring to keep up the credit of his
pretensions, in being sent, to be the re∣conciler
of the Jewish and Christian Re∣ligion,
and to compose a Law compre∣hending
both) to comply with <HI>Sergius,</HI>
who stood stifly for Baptism, he or∣dain'd
daily washings to all those who be∣came
<HI>Mahumetans,</HI> &amp; ascribed thereunto
no less efficacy than the cleansing of the
Soule. And that he might not disgust
<HI>Abdalla</HI> the Jew, he made Circumcision
admissive of Proselytes into his Law. But
did not institute it under any notion of
absolute Necessity, and indispensibly re∣quired
of all who undertook the Profes∣sion
of his Religion, but made the want
of it no impediment of future happiness.
And therefore in the admittance of a Re∣negado,
or the denyer of his first Reli∣gion,
circumcision is not exacted of the
Moors, for feare that the undergoing
of such a painful Sacrament should de∣ter
the Proselyte. But when any desires
to be of their perswasion, they carry the
new <HI>Musulman</HI> on horseback, in a kinde of
triumph through the streets, &amp; proclaims
that such an one being turn'd Moor,
<PB N="198" REF="108"/>
desires the assistance of their Prayers
that he may not Apostatise.</P>
<P>But their male children are initiated by
circumcision, and because the child may
die before it can be circumcised, there∣fore
the lack of this Write in such a case
is concluded to be no hindrance of its
enjoyment of Paradise. When the child
is seven days old, the Moors give it a
name, and the Father of it makes a feast.
But the imposition of the Name is done
in the publick assembly; for the Father
at the evening-Sallah carries to the
Church several dishes of Cuscussow, of
which he sets one apart for the Priest,
and the rest to be eaten up by the peo∣ple.
And when the Prayers are ended,
the congregation demand of the Father
what he will call his Child, and if the
Name he gives it be not satisfactory to
the People, they decide it by lots what
he shall be called, for every man here
has a Vote in the Nameing of his Neigh∣bour's
Child. And when they have a∣greed
the point, all pray that the child
may Live, prove Rich and Valiant, and
understand the <HI>Alcoran;</HI> then they eate
up the Cuscussow and depart. It is ob∣servable
<PB N="199" REF="108"/>
that the Priest neither at the
Nameing, nor circumcision of the child
has any apppropriate office, of which I
could finde no other reason, unless the
Moors estimate of these Ceremonies,
which they never reckon among the es∣sentials
of Religion.</P>
<P>There are some who have asserted,
that there is an inevitable time of circum∣cision
among all the Mahumetans; But
if they had lived in <HI>Barbary,</HI> they might
have lessen'd the proposition, for the
Moors circumcise their children when
they please, being by Law not bound up
to any particular day or hour. But
it is generally grown into fashion, to
circumcise at the Animadversary Feast
called <HI>Mulud,</HI> kept in December in me∣mory
of <HI>Muley Mahumed.</HI> And few or
none defer the circumcision of their
Males at the first <HI>Mulud</HI> after their nati∣vity.
Now there is no person set apart
for this office, but the child is circum∣cised
by any that has a gentle and nim∣ble
hand, to whom the parent gives a
bountiful reward.</P>
<P>When the Sonnes arrive to a due ma∣turity,
they are disposed of to Vocations,
<PB N="200" REF="109"/>
among which the Sword is reckon'd the
most honourable, as a Priviledge of Pri∣mogeniture
belongs to the first born.
The rest betake themselves to such Cal∣lings
as best agree with their inclinati∣ons
and Fathers fortunes. Many of
the wealthier sort put their Sonnes to
to be <HI>Talbyes,</HI> that in case they be re∣duced
to want, they be in capacity to
be received unto the Priesthood and be
maintain'd by the Church.</P>
<P>The Moors have no surnames, which
want they supply by adding to the
Child's name, either the name of some
remarkable time when it chanced to be
born, as the <HI>Ramadan, Mulud, Ashora,</HI>
and the like; or the name of the Fa∣ther
by prefixing <HI>Ben,</HI> as <HI>Hader Ben Ab∣dalla:</HI>
being the same with <HI>Thomas Fits
Williams, &amp;c.</HI> and the higher they de∣rive
the pedegree by reckoning up their
Ancestors, it is accounted the most ho∣nourable.
And in this they follow the
ancient custom, for to add to a man's
proper name, the proper name of
his Father by putting [Son] before
it, was of old in stead of that, which we
now call surnames: and in some parts
<PB N="201" REF="109"/>
this is not yet worn quite out of use.
Whether the names now given by the
Moors, are significative of any Virtues
desired or foretold by those that impose
them, to be in the Children, hath not
yet fal'n under my comprehension.</P>
<P>Curiosity tempting me in pursuance
of this Note, to enquire into their child-births;
I found that therein they obser∣ved
a decency conformable to the best
civilized People. For the pregnant
Wife perceiving the approach of her
pangs, call's for the <HI>Alcabla,</HI> or Mo∣ther,
the same with our Midwife, to as∣sist
her travailes, who never leaves her
till the seventh day after her delivery,
for so long she keeps her bed, and tar∣ries
forty dayes before she associates
with her husband. Who if he be scru∣pulous
will not embrace his Wife from
the time she appeares impregnate, till
the last minute of the forty days after
her delivery be accomplished.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Moresco Funeral Rites,
Testaments, Mourning for the
Dead, Esteem of Interment,
Sepulchres, Places of Burial,
&amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Moors</HI> are very careful that no∣thing
be wanting or disorderly in
the Rites of Burial, wherein the survi∣ving
Relations signifie great Sentiments
of humanity and affection toward the
deceased: whom when they understand
that they are sick, they delay not to vi∣sit,
on purpose to admonish them of their
Faults, and to exhort them to look for∣ward
to the great Pleasures of Paradise.
The Priest never omits this good Office
of assisting the sick; and I have been
told, that there are certain <HI>Azaora</HI>'s or
parcels of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> appointed to be
read on this occasion to the Infirm, who
if he die not while those <HI>Azaora</HI>'s are
thrice read over, it is an <HI>Omen</HI> of his
<PB N="203" REF="110"/>
Recovery; but if the Agony be obser∣ved
to increase in the time of Reading,
they conclude that the Patient will not
escape: which when the sick Man ob∣serves,
and sees that in all probability
his Distemper will terminate in Death,
he begins an exact disposal of his Estate,
whereof in the first place some part is be∣queath'd
to the Parochial Church where
he lives, and some small Legacies to the
<HI>Alfachí</HI> and <HI>Almudén,</HI> and the rest he
leaves to be divided by the <HI>Alcaddée</HI> a∣mong
his Wives and Children: in which
Distribution, a Son hath twice as much
as a Daughter, and the Wives can claim
no more then is set down in their Con∣tract
of Marriage.</P>
<P>In signification of their love to the
Dead, the near Kinred of both Sexes
use Tokens very expressive of Sorrow:
the Men testifie their Griefs by putting
on their courser <HI>Alheícks,</HI> and not wear∣ing
any thing that is very white about
them, which at other times is a chief part
of their bravery: for they account white
to be no less a token of chearfulness
then Innocency, and therefore account
the wearing thereof very improper
<PB N="204" REF="111"/>
for such sorrowful occasions. The Men
likewise (that are of near Alliance to the
Dead) cut not their Beards, but declare
their pensiveness; they suffer a great
neglect in all those Accoutrements, in
which at other times they are very cu∣rious;
and by a peculiar Fansie they
have some Hairs hanging over their Eyes
in token of a careless Sorrow. But this
is done chiefly for such as come to un∣timely
ends.</P>
<P>The Women are very loud and dolor∣ous
in their Lamentations of the de∣parted,
and they intermit not to howl
over the Corps while it is in the House,
which is not long, for as foon as the
Breath is expired, the dead Body is
washt with Sope and warm Water, by
those of the same Sex with the departed.
Then the Body is wrapt in white Linnen
and laid in a Coffin (though a Coffin is
but the lot of a few) on the right side,
with the Face toward <HI>Mecha,</HI> in which
posture it is also buryed. When the
Corps is carryed out to Burial, the
Priest goes next unto it, who coming to
the Grave or Sepulchre, prays that the
Sins of the Defunct may be remitted, and
<PB N="205" REF="111"/>
that he may have a Portion in the pro∣mised
Delights. Returning home from
the Buryal, they have a Feast to comfort
those of the Family who are not permit∣ted
to dress any thing while the Corps
are in the House: and this consolatory
Feast is great or small, according to the
condition of the Dead.</P>
<P>They account it a great unhappiness
for one of their Faith to want a decent
Interment; and therefore if any dye
without an Estate sufficient to discharge
his Funeral Expences, they supply it by
a Neighborly Contribution. Those that
are more Wealthy and Honorable have
Sepulchres, which vary both in Materi∣als
and Fashion: For some are built of
rough Stone, others of course Marble,
but the most of Brick: Some in form of
a half Moon, others open upon Pillars;
and some round and close, and to be
enter'd by a Door. But the Vulgar lye
in common Graves, cover'd with green
Turf and Boughs. At the Feet and
Head of those that are thus Buryed, they
fix large Stones, in which are writ the
Name of the Interr'd, with the Year of
his Age and <HI>Hegira.</HI> As for Epitaphs,
<PB N="206" REF="112"/>
they are quite worn out of request, yet
they were in great estimation of old, as
may be gather'd from that Collection
which <HI>John Leo</HI> made thereof, and pre∣sented
it to a Brother of a King of
<HI>Fez.</HI></P>
<P>Upon every Friday the Women repair
to the Graves of their deceased Friends,
whose deaths they bewail with a very
loud and bitter Lamentation, recount∣ing
the great Satisfaction and Pleasure
which they once enjoy'd in their Socie∣ty.
And because they believe that on
every Friday the Soul returns to the
Body, they spread the Graves with sweet
Flowers and green Boughs on purpose to
refresh it, and to adorn the Grave. But
there are some <HI>Moors</HI> which hold this
Rite for a Mystery in their Religion,
and therefore pretend not to give any
account of its usage. They have one
thing in Buryal, observed no where else,
which is not to bury another in the same
Grave where one has been Interr'd be∣fore,
and therefore they use certain
Marks to secure them from mistakes.</P>
<P>It has been often told me, That the
<HI>Moresco</HI> Women in their Weekly La∣mentations
<PB N="207" REF="112"/>
of the dead, use to ask them
what reason they had to dye, seeing that
they enjoyed loving Friends, wanting
none of the Comforts of this Life, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
But I found this was an idle Story, and a
<HI>Moor</HI> assured me that they had no such
Custom, and that it could be the Calum∣ny
of none but a deceitful Jew.</P>
<P>Neither is that other Story of more
credit, which makes the <HI>Moors</HI> reserve a
vacant Place in the Grave, to give the
dead Carcass room to rise up and kneel
before two pretty Angels, who come to
confess the <HI>Departed</HI> concerning the
great Points of the Law; namely, pay∣ing
of Tythes, giving of Alms, and ob∣serving
of <HI>Rámadon:</HI> for upon mature
Enquiry, I was assur'd that the <HI>Moors</HI>
had no such Article in their Creed.</P>
<P>The places of Burial that belong to
great Towns, are in the Fields: but in
the Country they are generally by the
High-ways, which may be to put Pas∣sengers
in mind of their Mortality. The
Ground which is set apart for this Im∣ployment,
is usually the Donative of
some devout Person, or purchased with
Legacies bequeath'd for that purpose.
<PB N="208" REF="113"/>
And that there might be no fraud pra∣ctised
in this Particular, both <HI>Alfachí</HI>
and <HI>Alcáddee</HI> keep Registers of all such
Donations, which are transmitted to
Posterity. When the Ground is once
devoted to this service, the <HI>Moors</HI> call
it <HI>Blessed</HI> and <HI>Holy,</HI> and accounted its a∣lienation
an unpardonable Wickedness.
Neither the Christians, nor any of an∣other
Religion, are permitted to tread
within these Burial Places, unless they
be their Slaves, whom they admit to any
thing capable of service, and use as sore∣ly
as their Dogs. These Slaves always
wait upon the Women to the Sepulchres,
but for no other intent then to carry
their Flowers and Boughs, and to assist
them therewith to dress the Graves.</P>
<P>There is no <HI>Aldéa</HI> or Village that has
a Church, but it hath also a peculiar
Burying Place, given or bought as hath
been already mentioned.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Moresco Ramadàn, its in∣stitution,
moveableness, man∣ner
of Celebration.</HEAD>
<P>SOme have imagin'd that for twelve
Years after the promulgation of the
<HI>Mahumetan</HI> Law, the Sectaries thereof
kept the same Fasts with the Jews: but
<HI>Mahuméd</HI> being displeas'd with that re∣fractory
People, and scorning to bor∣row
any of their Institutions, command∣ed
his Proselytes to abandon their Fasts,
and appointed in their room the Moon
<HI>Ramadan,</HI> to be kept in an <HI>Anniversary
Abstinence.</HI> But others date this Lent
from the second Year of <HI>Mahumeds</HI> Pro∣phesie,
and that it fell out in the Month
<HI>September,</HI> at which time the <HI>Alcoran</HI> is
said to have been sent from Heaven. But
it is not likely that the Fast was in me∣mory
thereof, because so great a Bles∣sing
(in the <HI>Mahumedans</HI> Estimation) de∣served
to be kept in mind by a far dif∣ferent
Memorial, great Mercies having
<PB N="210" REF="114"/>
never been Celebrated with Penances
and Corporeal Humiliations, but rather
with Festival Expressions of Joy, and
Actions significative of Exaltation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ramadàn</HI> is moveable, and de∣pends
on the appearance of the New
Moon, which, if through the Cloudi∣ness
of the Weather they cannot dis∣cern,
they tarry till it may be presumed
by the course of Nature that it is Chan∣ged.
And those who are less Learned
in the <HI>Lunar</HI> Mutations, continue the
Fast for thirty days, being assured that
in that Period the Moon must fulfil her
course.</P>
<P>A Winter <HI>Ramadàn</HI> is very welcome
to the <HI>Moors,</HI> because their Labors are
not then so pressive, and better then to
be endured, by reason of the coldness of
the Season: and the Fast is not so affli∣ctive,
because the Days are short, and
the Nights long to Revel in.</P>
<P>Though this be the severest Precept
in the <HI>Mahumedan</HI> Law, yet it is not
without all capacities of Indulgence, for
therein is had special Regard to the
wayfaring and infirm, who have Licence
to eat in the day time, with this Caution,
<PB N="211" REF="114"/>
That at the end of their Journey, and
upon their recovery from Sickness, they
perform the full account of their Lent.
As for the rest, they are enjoyned no
more then a diurnal Abstinence, having
the Night at liberty for all Fruitions
they can procure, Wine onely excepted,
which by those who at other times libe∣rally
drink it, is for this Moon totally
renounced. The breach of this First they
punish with Stoning to death, and there
is no necessity can Priviledge any (ex∣cept
Travellers and ins<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Persons) to
eat or drink till the Evening Star wit∣nesseth
that the Day is shut in.</P>
<P>They make great Provision for this
<HI>Ramadàn,</HI> wherewith they furnish out
their Necturnal Festivals; and for this
end, use a great Frugality before for
some days.</P>
<P>They place a great Sanctity in this Fast,
which yet to a Scrupulist scarce would
seem to deserve that name, for the Day
is usually past away in a loytering Slee∣piness,
and the Night in Junketing: the
one is at best but a drowzy Lent, and the
other a Luxurious Carnival. Yet there
is a devouter sort of <HI>Bygots,</HI> who spend
<PB N="212" REF="115"/>
the Day in the Church and Devotion,
and are very reserved in their Nightly
Caresses, living for the whole Moon se∣perate
from Women, where they super∣erogate,
their Law no where exacting
this Severity▪ for such was the Carnal
Temper of their Prophet, that he thought
it an Impossibility to live a whole day
Continent. Both Sexes are bound to
begin this Fast at the twelfth Year of
their Age, and it is placed among the
Articles necessarily requisite to the Con∣stitution
of a perfect <HI>Mahumetan.</HI></P>
<P>The last day of the Moon, the <HI>Moors</HI>
spend in doleful Lamentations of their
deceased Relations, and with their
Yearly Commemoratives end the Fast.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Moresco Feasts.</HEAD>
<P>AT the end of their Lent, <HI>Mahumed</HI>
instituted a Festival Solemnity, as
hath been imagined in imitation of the
Christians <HI>Ester.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> call it
<PB N="213" REF="115"/>
<HI>Bairam;</HI> the <HI>Moors, El Ed Geer,</HI> or the
Little Feast: Little, not in respect of
its duration, but Expence; for it lasts
three days, which equals it in length
with any of the rest.</P>
<P>On the first day thereof they spread
the Floor of their <HI>Giámma</HI>'s with co∣loured
Leather, and then entertain each
other with Honey, sweet Butter, and
Wafers. And according to the per∣formance
of this Festival, they Divine,
as the <HI>Egyptians</HI> by their <HI>Nilescope,</HI> the
Blessings and Plenty of the descending
Year.</P>
<P>About two Moneths after, the <HI>Moors</HI>
have another Festival, by them called,
<HI>El Ed Gueber,</HI> or the Great Feast, in
respect of the Expences and Charges
thereof. This Festival still commenceth
with a Sermon, which the <HI>Alcalib</HI> or chief
Priest makes concerning its Institution,
with amplification of its Praises. Re∣turning
home from the Sermon, the
<HI>Moors</HI> fall to killing such Sheep as they
have made choice of for their Entertain∣ment
at this Solemnity, and there is not
the meanest Fortune, but now has his
Sheep which is killed, by cutting the
<PB N="241" REF="116"/>
Throat thereof, with their Faces to∣wards
<HI>Mecha,</HI> and Swearing by <HI>Alquiblá.</HI>
This done, every Family takes the Heart
and Appurtenances, and immediatly
dress it with Saffron, red and black Pep∣per;
then, with store of Bread, they
bring it to their Parish Church (where
every Quality knows his station) and eat
it in Communion. Returning from this
Ecclesiastick Ordinary, they pass the
second and third Day in Eating and
Drinking. This is also called the Mut∣ton
Feast.</P>
<P>The next to this is their <HI>Ashorah,</HI>
which lasts but one Day, and call'd a
Feast of Fruits, nothing being then eat∣en
but Dates, Figs, purched Corn, and
all such natural Cates as their Substances
can procure. This Festival is not held
in <HI>Giámma</HI>'s, but every Father of a Fa∣mily
treats his Houshold under his own
Roof. And the rich on this day give a
Portion of their Estates to the Poor,
who on the Morning of the Festival go
from one <HI>Giámma</HI> to another, and re∣ceive
the Yearly Alms, which are pro∣portionably
divided amongst them. None
cast into this Treasury who have not a
<PB N="215" REF="116"/>
certain sum of Money in Possession;
and he that has less then ten <HI>Metacáles</HI>
(which something exceeds our Five shil∣ling
Pieces) is exempt from this <HI>Corban.</HI></P>
<P>At the receipt of these Alms, the Poor
pray that God would increase the Givers
store, and enable them to bestow more
the next <HI>Ashoráh,</HI> telling them, That
this fulfilling of the Law, is the best as∣surance
of rendring their Petitions suc∣cessful.</P>
<P><HI>Anseràh</HI> is another <HI>Moresco</HI> Festival,
which lasts but a day; and with the <HI>An∣daluzian
Moors</HI> bears the Name of Saint
<HI>John Baptist</HI>'s, or the Feast of the Chri∣stians.
On this Festival, those who live
within ten Leagues of the Sea come thi∣ther
to wash themselves; and those who
cannot, by reason of distance, repair to
that great Monopoly of Waters, take
Salt and throw it into the Fountains at
home, and Bath themselves in that coun∣terfeit
Ocean. This is exactly at Mid∣summer,
and held in Commemoration of
that great Blessing of Water. The Vi∣ands
of this Feast exceed not their ordi∣nary
Provisions, only they eat them with
greater alacrity.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="117"/>
<HI>Mulud</HI> is the Yearly Feast for Circum∣cision,
and continueth three days; on
the first whereof, they make a <HI>Gátcha,</HI>
or Hodge-podge of Flower, Water,
Butter and Honey, and carry great
quantities thereof to the Church, whi∣ther
they invite one another, saying,
<HI>Come, let us go to the</HI> Allamdillah, <HI>or to
the Feast that is made to</HI> Mahumed <HI>for
Gods sake:</HI> And when they have eaten of
this homely Dish in the Church, they
leave store thereof to be devoured by the
Poor, and spend the two following days
in good Neighborhood and plentiful
Collations. This is their chiefest Feast,
because at it their Males are Circumci∣sed,
and may seem to have a reference
to the old <HI>Whitsuntide</HI> among the Chri∣stians.
But I forbear to swell these Re∣marks
with such Conjectural References,
which if I should enterprise, I might
make all <HI>Mahumeds</HI> Institutions yield
some probable Resemblances of those
ancient Customs &amp; Ordinances in usage
among Jews and Christians; and shew,
that this great Deceiver has confused
both the Testaments into his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> la∣boring
thereby to have his first Pretensi∣ons
<PB N="217" REF="117"/>
made creditable, That he came to
reconcile Jew and Christian unto the o∣bedience
of one and the same Law.</P>
<P>These <HI>Moresco</HI> Festivals seem not so
much Commemorative of received Mer∣cies,
as relaxatives of Corporeal Labors,
from which they are observed to have
no other Divertisements. For Cards
and Dice are utterly abhorr'd by the
better Families, not only as forbidden
by the Law, under the Infamous terms
of Diabolical Inventions, but as obser∣ved
to be occasions of many nocive Pas∣sions,
engendring Debates, and Incen∣tives
to Avarice: Besides, they are look'd
upon as Effeminate and Trivial Enter∣tainments,
fit onely for Sea-men, and
Women; the former being much vers'd
in this Idleness, though no such Asper∣sion
can be cast on the latter.</P>

<P>WHen the <HI>Moresco</HI> Gentry are dis∣posed
to Sports, the Wild Boar
fits them with a Manly Exercise, and af∣fords
them both Pastime and Improve∣ment;
and when in the failure of some
Circumstance they are debarr'd this kind
of Recreation, they supply it with their
Lances in Lusory Skirmishes on Horse∣back,
wherein their Dexterity cannot
be too much admired.</P>
<P>But they are naturally uninclin'd to
Sports, being very Saturnine, and loving
the Extremes, either to sit still, or to
be in robustious Motions. They spend
much of their Time in a sort of drowzy
Conference, but the sum of their Do∣mestick
Entertainments, are their Wo∣men
and their Chess-boards: All com∣municating
in the former, but the latter
is only the serious Pastime of the <HI>Vir∣tuoso</HI>'s.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="118"/>
They use Vocal and Instrumental Mu∣sick,
but in both are very serious and
plain, devoid of Levity or Flourish.
Their usual Instruments are the <HI>Rabèb</HI>
and <HI>Ahlùd;</HI> the former resembles our
Violin, but strung only with one great
Cord of Hair; the other a Getar. In
<HI>Fez</HI> they have Lutes, and those who will
teach them well. The <HI>Alárbs</HI> have an
Instrument call'd <HI>Zauphèn,</HI> like the bot∣tom
of a Kettle, on which they Tinckle
with a stick. The <HI>Tituanezes</HI> have a
less Organ, and also use a sort of Tabor
and Pipe when they march in the Field.
So most Towns have their peculiar sorts
of Musick. The singing part is per∣form'd
by <HI>Negra</HI>'s, not for any peculiar
Excellency they are happy in, but be∣cause
singing at publick Dances is look'd
upon as Slavish.</P>
<P>In their Dances they permit no mix∣ture
of Men with the marryed Women,
which is granted to the Virgins, who up∣on
some Solemnities Dance with the
Batchelors; but so closely Veild, that
not any part about them is seen naked.
They act the Tune with their Hands and
Head, and abhor as loose and lascivious,
<PB N="220" REF="119"/>
Jigs, or high Dancing. Every Town and
<HI>Cavíla</HI> have their own Dances, which
are known by several Names. The <HI>Fes∣sians</HI>
have a Dance called <HI>Estitati,</HI> which
is used in <HI>Sally, Mekenèz, Alcazàr,</HI> &amp;c.
Those of the City of <HI>Morocco</HI> have one
named <HI>Sholakebèr;</HI> and in the <HI>Cavíla</HI>'s
of <HI>Minchèl, Bemi-Wadres,</HI> &amp;c. there is
a Dance stiled <HI>Ismmaháh.</HI> It seldom
happens that those of one Town know
the Dances of another, therefore thofe
who use this Divertisement, only know
the Name and Mode of the Dance where
they live.</P>
<P>Their set Times are their Weddings

Miscellaneous Notes, occasionally col∣lected
from Discourse and Observation,
of whose Credit I have not many Argu∣ments

Notice concerns the Temperature of the
Air in this Part of <HI>Barbary,</HI> wherein
there is some Variation according to the

Summer is more temperate then at <HI>Mo∣rocco.</HI>
The Inhabitants of the latter for
several Hours cannot endure the Heat a∣broad,
and therefore for that time keep
close within: But the People of the for∣mer
are by no such Excess constrain'd
to intermit their Labours. Albeit, as I
have observed in other Countrys, much
herein is to be imputed to Humor and
Custom.</P>
<P>The Inland Country is hotter in Sum∣mer,
and colder in Winter then the Ma∣ritine,
which may easily be conceived,

which, such Rivers are caused, that
in some places the Channels will yield
<PB N="222" REF="120"/>
Water the whole Summer ensuing.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants live long, and are
generally Healthy; the Diseases, when
they happen, are Fluxes, after the Sea∣son
of Fruits; and Calentures, when
they immoderately Travel in the Sun.
And what seems herein remarkable, the
Winter (which Season consist of great
Rains) is most mortal amongst them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lues Venerea,</HI> or Foul Disease
(which the <HI>Moors</HI> call <HI>Bubès)</HI> is incident
to those who accompany with variety of
Women: and though this may seem to
confine that Distemper to those <HI>Moors,</HI>
who live after a more rude and roving
manner, yet it is no stranger to those of
a more refin'd and setled Life, the Gran∣dees
of late having herein exceeded the
Paisants.</P>
<P>As to the Plague, they observe no set
time of its return, the tenth and fifteenth
Year of its coming being worn out of
Remarks; and in this last Century it
has hapned very seldom, but in no parts
it doth rage more furi usly then in <HI>Bar∣bary:</HI>
and when they are visited, the
Inhabitants take little or no care to a∣void
it, holding it to be inevitable.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="120"/>
In cure of Sicknesses, they use very
plain Medicines, and whatever be the
Disease, Cauterizing is first practised,
which they do with no more Art or Cu∣riosity,
then with a Knife red hot to gash
and cut the place where the Pain lies. To
cure the Head-ach, they take the Root
<HI>Tauz Argent</HI> and Rosemary, burning
them in an Earthen Pot, over which the
Diseased holds his Head for the Fume;
then binding the same in a Cloth about
the Head, present ease is given. This
<HI>Tauz Argent</HI> is a Root, much Celebrated
for an excellent and lasting Perfume:
there is great store thereof about <HI>Sally,</HI>
which is white within, without duskish
and streaked. The <HI>Moors</HI> use it in Air∣ing
and Perfuming their Rooms, but the
scent is much less durable then has been
reported.</P>
<P>The People, when sick, cure them∣selves
with Herbs, in whose Virtues the
common People have a traditional know∣ledge.
By this they supply the want of
Apothecaries and Physitians, of which
Profession none are found, except a few
Mountebank ignorant Jews.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moors</HI> have an Herb called <HI>la Ha∣lis,</HI>
<PB N="224" REF="121"/>
which mingled with Honey, they
make up into Balls as big as Pistol Bul∣lets,
and of these they swallow five or six
at a time, which they find to procure
Appetite, further Digestion, and to
make Frolick, Amorous and Witty. <HI>O∣pium</HI>
is much used by all sorts, rather for
Dyet then Physick; and a <HI>Moor</HI> will
sooner buy a Pill of <HI>Opium,</HI> then a Cake
of Bread, if his stock be too little to buy
both. And in many places they are so
accustomed to this Stupefactive, that the
want thereof proves fatal.</P>
<P>In former Times the People were so
exquisite in mingling Poysons, that they
had some would kill by smell: Of late
they are acquainted only with two
kinds, which they call <HI>Rahásh</HI> and <HI>Ze∣him.</HI>
The former is either white or pale,
and more quick in dispatching the Per∣son
who takes it. But <HI>Zehim</HI> (signify∣ing
any thing that is coutrary to the Pa∣lat
or liking) is cured with incessant
Spitting. As for that Poyson which once
they had the Art to communicate in Let∣ters,
to kill those who read them, they
are thereof at present totally Igno∣rant.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="121"/>
<HI>Muley Mahumed</HI> having out of Politick
Ends prohibited Printing, made thereby
Writing of a more singular use and e∣steem;
and the <HI>Moors</HI> of old were noted
to be very excellent at the Pen, but now
in this, as in all other Learning, they are
much deficient of what they were for∣merly,
for there are not many that ar∣rive
to a higher Proficieney in Letters,
then barely to Write and Read: To
which end they have little Schools,
where the Children are taught after this
manner. The <HI>Moors</HI> having (as I said)
no Printed Books, when their Children
are sent to School, they take with them
pieces of Boards, or Slats, on which the
School-Master writes so many Letters of
the Alphabet; and when the Child has
learn'd their Names and Figures, the
Master writes them a certain number
more, and so proceeds till the Alphabet
be ended: and then goes on to write
some Periods of the <HI>Alcoran</HI> (for they
teach no other Book) and continue this
Method till the whole <HI>Alcoran</HI> be wrote
over, which usually lasts four Years.
When the Child has thus spelt it over, he
begins to get it by heart, which costs
<PB N="226" REF="122"/>
eight Years at the least; then the Child,
if his Father be able, is taught a little
Orthography. When the Child is come
to certain Periods of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> the
Father is obliged to make him a Congra∣tulatory
Present: and when he has
learn'd the whole <HI>Alcoran,</HI> he is brought
home to his Fathers House in Procession
on Horse-back. As he Rides along, he
holds a Table written with <HI>Mahumeds</HI>
Law, whereon he continually fixeth his
Eye, thereby signifying, That the Ho∣nor
conferr'd upon him was for the care∣ful
Reading of the <HI>Alcoran;</HI> and when
the Youth, accompanyed with the <HI>Al∣faqùi,</HI>
School-master, and School-fellows,
hath visited all the Churches, they come
to his Fathers House, where they are en∣tertain'd,
and the Master rewarded for
the care shewn in the Proficiency of his
Scholar.</P>
