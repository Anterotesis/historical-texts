<HEAD>THE First Discovery of the New World called AMERICA.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>HAving already given an account of His Majesty of Great <HI>Britains</HI> three famous Kingdoms of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> we shall now ship our selves for a <HI>New World,</HI> and therein discover the Acquisitions and Dominions of the <HI>English</HI> Monarchy in <HI>Amercia.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>New World</HI> is the most proper name for this im∣mense Countrey, and new, as being discovered by <HI>Christopher Columbus,</HI> not two hundred years ago, in 1492. The Ancient Fathers, Philosophers, and Poets, were of opinion, that those places near the North and South Pole were inhabitable, by the extre∣mity of cold, and the middle parts, because of unrea∣sonable heat, and thought it a great solecism or con∣tradiction, to believe the Earth was round, for hold∣ing which opinion Pope <HI>Zachaus</HI> was so zealous against Bishop <HI>Virgil,</HI> that he sentenced him, <HI>To be cast out of
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
the Temple, and Church of God, and to be deprived of his Bishop∣rick for this perverse Doctrine, that there were Antipodes, or people whose feet are placed against ours,</HI> though this disco∣very of <HI>America</HI> has fully confirmed these opinions, and evinced that there is no such torrid Zone, where the heat is so noxious, as to unpeople any part of the Earth, and the yearly compassing of the World, eviden∣ceth the necessity of Inhabitants, living on all parts of this earthly Globe; The next inquiry may be, whe∣ther the Ancient had any knowledge of these Regions, which many incline to think they had not; for though <HI>Seneca</HI> says in his <HI>Msdea, That new Worlds shall be discover∣ed in the last Ages of the World, and</HI> Thule <HI>in</HI> Norway, <HI>shall be no longer the utmost Nation of the World,</HI> yet this seems only to intimate the common effects and dis∣coveries of Navigation; And <HI>Plato's Atlantis,</HI> cannot intend this Countrey, because he placeth it at the mouth of the Streights or <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, which is separat∣ed from <HI>America</HI> by a vast Ocean, and saies it is not now in being, but was by an earthquake sunk and over∣whelmed in the Sea: Other Authors since that time have mentioned some Islands in that Great Sea, but they seem rather to be some of those on the Coasts of <HI>Africa,</HI> than <HI>America,</HI> it being improbable, if not im∣possible, any should undertake such long and dangerous Voyages, before the compass was found out, when they were only directed by the motion of the Sun and Stars.</P>
<P>Yet is it not incredible but that in former Ages, some Ships might by Tempest or other Casualties be driven to these parts, whereby some parts of <HI>America</HI> were peopled, but it is likely none ever returned back again to bring any news of their voyage. The most proba∣ble Relation of this kind is that of <HI>Madoc ap Owen Gwyneth,</HI> who upon the Civil dissentions in his own Countrey of <HI>Wales,</HI> adventured to Sea, and leaving <HI>Ireland</HI> on the North, came to a Land unknown, where he saw many very wonderful things, which by Dr. <HI>Dowel</HI> and Mr. <HI>Humfrey Lloyd</HI> is judged to be the main Land of <HI>America,</HI> being confirmed therein, as well by the
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
saying of <HI>Montezuma</HI> Emperor of <HI>Mexico,</HI> who declared that his Progenitors were Strangers as well as the rest of the <HI>Mexicans,</HI> as by the use of divers <HI>Welch</HI> words amongst them observed by Travellers; the story adds, that <HI>Ma∣doc</HI> left several of his People there, and coming home, returned back with ten sail full of <HI>Welchmen,</HI> yet it is cer∣tain there are now left very few footsteps of this <HI>Brit∣tish</HI> expedition, and no signs thereof were found at the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Arrival; they indeed used a Cross at <HI>Cumana,</HI> and worshipped it at <HI>Acuzamil,</HI> but without the least memory or knowledge of Jesus Christ, and the <HI>Welch</HI> words are very few, which might happen by chance to any other Language. Mr. <HI>Bretewood,</HI> and other learn∣ed writers are of Opinion, that <HI>America</HI> received her first Inhabitants from those parts of <HI>Asia,</HI> where the <HI>Tartars</HI> first inhabited the Coasts of both Countreys, being in that place not far asunder, and the likeness of the People favouring the same, though the <HI>Indians</HI> in general are so very ignorant as to ascribe their begin∣ning, some to a Fountain, and others to a Lake or Cave; But leaving these uncertainties, let us give a brief ac∣count of the real discovery thereof by <HI>Columbus,</HI> which is thus related by <HI>Gomara</HI> and <HI>Mariana,</HI> two Spanish writers.</P>
<P>A certain Caravel sailing in the Ocean, was carried by a strong East wind of long continuance to an un∣known Land never mentioned in the Maps or Charts of that Age; this Ship was much longer in returning than going, so that all the company perisht by famine or other extremities, except the Pilot, and three or four Mariners, who all likewise died soon after their arrival, leaving to <HI>Columbus</HI> their Landlord their Papers, with some account of their Discoveries; the time, place, Countrey, and name of this Pilot is uncertain, and therefore other Authors affirm it to be a fable or <HI>Spanish</HI> contrivance, as envying that an <HI>Italian</HI> and Forreigner should have the glory of being the first discoverer of the Indies, and the more judicious <HI>Spaniards</HI> account it a Tale, and give a more probable Relation thereof, and of the cause which moved <HI>Columbus</HI> to this mighty un∣dertaking,
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
and not the Pilots Papers or reports; For they write, that <HI>Christopher Colon</HI> or <HI>Columbus,</HI> was born at <HI>Nervi</HI> in the Territories of <HI>Genoa,</HI> and bred a Mari∣ner from his Child-hood, trading into <HI>Syria</HI> and other Eastern Countries, after which he learnt the art of making Sea Cards, and went to <HI>Portugal</HI> to acquaint himself with the Coasts of <HI>Africa,</HI> and there married; In sayling about these Seas, he observed, that at certain seasons of the year, the winds blew from the West, for a great while together, and judging they came from some Coasts beyond the Sea, he was so concerned, that he resolved to make a Trial thereof; He was now for∣ty years old, and propounding to the State of <HI>Genoa,</HI> that if they would furnish him with Ships, he would find a way by the West to the Islands of Spices, they re∣jected it as a dream or idle fancy; Being thus frustrate of his hopes, he goes to <HI>Portugal,</HI> and communicates his design to King <HI>Alphonsus,</HI> but with the same success; upon which he sent his Brother <HI>Bartholomew Columbus,</HI> to King <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh of <HI>England,</HI> to sollicit his assistance, while himself went into <HI>Spain,</HI> to impiore aid of the <HI>Castilians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bartholomew</HI> was unhappily taken by Pirates in his voyage to <HI>England,</HI> who robbing him and his company of all they had, he at length arrived, and was forced to get a mean livelyhood by making Sea Cards, and in a short time presents a Map of the World to King <HI>Henry,</HI> with his Brothers offer of discovery, which the King gladly accepted, and sent for him into <HI>England;</HI> But he had sped in his suit before in <HI>Spain,</HI> for coming thi∣ther, and conferring with two able <HI>Spanish</HI> Pilots they advised him to apply himself to the Dukes of <HI>Medina Sidonia,</HI> and <HI>Medina Caeli,</HI> who giving him recommen∣dation to the Queens Confessor, he arrived at the Court of <HI>Castile,</HI> in 1486. but <HI>Ferdinando</HI> and <HI>Isabella</HI> then King and Queen of <HI>Spain,</HI> being ingaged hotly in the Wars of <HI>Granada</HI> against the <HI>Moors,</HI> he at first found but cold entertainment. Thus he continued for some time in a mean and contemptible Condition, till at
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
length the Archbishop of <HI>Toledo</HI> procured him audi∣ence, where he was favourably received, and promis∣ed dispatch upon concluding the Wars in <HI>Granada,</HI> and accordingly he was furnished with three Caravels at the Kings charges, and sixteen thousand Duckets in money.</P>
<P>In 1492. <HI>August</HI> 3. <HI>Columbus</HI> accompanied with about one hundred and Twenty Persons, set sail for <HI>Gomera,</HI> one of the <HI>Canary</HI> Islands, where having refresht, after many days, they encountred the Sea called <HI>Sargasso,</HI> from an Herb like <HI>Sampire,</HI> wherewith it is so covered, that it appears like a green Field, with empty berries, like a Gooseberry, and is so thick, that the Water cannot be seen, hindring the passage of the Ship, without a strong wind; these weeds are thought to reach to the bottom of the Sea, though there exceeding deep, and above four hundred miles distant from the Coast of <HI>Africa;</HI> This strange accident much surprized the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI> and had occasioned their return, had not the sight of some birds incouraged them with hopes of Land not far off; After thirty three days sayling, despairing of success, the company mutined, threatning to throw <HI>Columbus</HI> into the Sea, disdaining that a <HI>Genouse</HI> stranger should thus abuse them, but at length by soft words, and strong promises he qualified their anger, <HI>Oct.</HI> 11. following, one <HI>Roderigo di Triana,</HI> cried out, <HI>Land, Land;</HI> the best musick that <HI>Columbus</HI> could de∣sire, who to pacify the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> had ingaged, that if no Land appeared in three days he would then return; one of the company the night before had descried Fire, which raised his expectation of having some great re∣ward from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> of which being frustrate at his return, he in a rage renounced his Christianity and turned Moor.</P>
<P>With Tears of Joy, the late mutinous Mariners be∣hold the desired Land, and they that Yesterday were ready to destroy, now as far distracted with contrary passions, imbrace and almost adore their dear <HI>Columbus,</HI> for so happily bringing them to this Land of Promise;
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
On shore they go, and felling a Tree, make a Cross thereof, which they there erected, and took possession of this New World, in the name of the Catholick King; They first landed in an Island called <HI>Guanah<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ni,</HI> one of the <HI>Lucai,</HI> which <HI>Columbus</HI> named St. <HI>Salvadore,</HI> from whence he sayled to <HI>Baracoa,</HI> an Haven on the North side of the Isle of <HI>Cuba,</HI> and landing, inquired of the Inhabitants for <HI>Cipango,</HI> or <HI>Japan,</HI> which they under∣standing to be <HI>Cibao</HI> in <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> where are the richest Mines, they made signs to them that they were in <HI>Haiti,</HI> which name they gave to <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> and some of them went with him thither; but no earthly joy is without some disaster, for here their Admiral split upon a Rock, but the men were saved by the help of other Ships; This happened on the North part of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> where they saw some Inhabitants, who for fear of strangers, instantly fled into the Mountains: One wo∣man they got, whom they used kindly, giving her meat, drink and clothes, and so dismissing her, who declaring their civility to the rest, they soon came in Troops to the Ships, judging the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to be some Divine Na∣tion sent from Heaven; Though before they thought them Canibals or Man-eaters, and such indeed they afterward proved in some sense, not leaving in some few years after their arrival above two hundred <HI>Indians,</HI> alive, of four Millions that before inhabited these Coun∣tries.</P>
<P>Before the discovery of this Island by <HI>Columbus,</HI> the People were informed thereof by an Oracle, for one of their Kings being very importunate with their <HI>Zemes,</HI> or Gods, to know future events, fasted five days toge∣ther, spending his time in continual mourning; After which the <HI>Zemes</HI> declared; <HI>That some years after there would arrive a strange Nation, clothed, bearded, and armed with shining Swords, which would out a man asunder in the middle, who should destroy the ancient Images of their Gods, abolish their Ceremonies, and slay their Children.</HI> In remembrance of which Oracle they composed a solemn Elegy, which upon Holy days they used mournfully to sing. Nothing
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
more pleased the <HI>Spaniards</HI> than the Gold, which the In∣nocent Inhabitants exchanged with them for Bells, Glasses, Points, and other Trifles. <HI>Columbus</HI> got leave of the King of <HI>Hispaniola</HI> to build a Fort, and leaving 38 <HI>Spaniards</HI> therein, taking with him six <HI>Indians,</HI> he re∣turned to <HI>Spain,</HI> and was highly caressed by the King and Q. and being honoured with the Title of Admiral, and inriched with the Tenths of the <HI>Spanish</HI> gains in the <HI>In∣dies,</HI> he is sent a second time (with his Brother <HI>Bartho∣lomew,</HI> who was made Vice-Roy of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI>) with seventeen sail of Ships, and fifteen hundred men; when he arrived, he found all his men were murdered by the <HI>Indians,</HI> who laid the blame on their insolent carriage toward them.</P>
<P><HI>Columbus</HI> now built the Town of <HI>Isabella,</HI> and after∣ward Saint <HI>Domingo,</HI> and Fort St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> but in both places the <HI>Spaniards</HI> died of Famine; for the <HI>Indians</HI> being unwilling to have such Neighbours, refused to plant their Maiz and Jucca, and so starved both them∣selves and their new Guests. At this place the <HI>Spaniards</HI> got that terrible disease called since the <HI>French</HI> Pox, of the <HI>Indian</HI> women, and in requital brought among them a more mortal and infectious distemper, that is, the Small-Pox, which destroyed Thousands, and was utterly unknown before in that Countrey. After this <HI>Columbus</HI> discovered <HI>Cuba, Jamaica,</HI> and other adjacent Isles, and likewise part of the main Land of <HI>America;</HI> He repaired his Fleet at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where some of his men were sick, and others mutinous, which the <HI>Indians</HI> observing, re∣fused to bring him in provisions, whereupon being straitned, he thought of this Stratagem, sending for some of the Islanders, he assured them, that if they did not furnish him with necessaries, the Divine wrath would consume them, a token whereof would be, that within two days, the face of the Moon should be dark∣ned, at which time he knew there would be an Ecclipse of the Moon, which these simple People find∣ing
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
to happen accordingly, they came and humbly submitted themselves to him, offering all the Assistance and supplies he desired. Another time some difference happening among the <HI>Spaniards, Columbus</HI> sent a Letter to reduce them to Peace by some of the <HI>Indians,</HI> who had extraordinary reverence for it, thinking the Paper to have some Spirit or Deity inclosed in it, whereby they could understand one anothers minds at so great di∣stance. <HI>Columbus</HI> at length returning into <HI>Spain,</HI> he there died in 1506, and was buried at <HI>Sevil;</HI> after whose ex∣ample several others made further Discoveries, till at last this <HI>New World,</HI> is now almost wholly come to the knowledge of the <HI>Old.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. Among other great Adventurers <HI>Hernando Cortes</HI> may be recorded, who in 1485. sailed out of <HI>Spain,</HI> being but 19 Years old, to the Island of St. <HI>Domingo,</HI> where being kindly received by <HI>Ovando</HI> the Governour, he discovered many new Provinces, and designed further Westward, because he heard there were Mines of Gold; and having first made the Inhabitants Swear Allegiance to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> to whom he said the Monarchy of the Universe did belong, he Sailed up the River <HI>Tavasco,</HI> where a Town which stood thereon refusing him Vi∣ctuals, he took and plundred it; the <HI>Indians</HI> hereat in∣raged, raised an Army of Forty Thousand Men, but <HI>Cortes</HI> by his Horse and great Guns, soon defeated them, they imagining the Horse and Man to be but one Crea∣ture, and when they heard them Neigh, thought the Horses could speak, and inquired what they said, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> answered, <HI>these Horses are very much offended with you for fighting with them, and would have you severely punished;</HI> the Innocent <HI>Indians</HI> hereupon presented Ro∣ses and Hens to the Beasts, desiring them to eat, and to pardon their Miscarriages. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> named this Town <HI>Victory,</HI> containing near twenty five thousand Hou∣ses, many of them Built of Lime, Stone and Brick; he then sailed farther West to St. <HI>John de Ʋlla,</HI> where the Governour of the Country came to him, with four Thousand <HI>Indians,</HI> adoring and burning Frankincense
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
and little Straws dipt in his own blood to <HI>Cortes,</HI> and then presented him Victuals, Jewels, Gold, and curi∣ous works of Feathers, which <HI>Cortes</HI> requited with a Collar of Glass, and other things of small value; a Wo∣man Slave given him at the Town of <HI>Victory,</HI> was his In∣terpreter, by whom <HI>Cortes</HI> informed the Governour, that he was Servant to the greatest Emperour upon Earth, at which the other much wondred, thinking there had been none so mighty as his Soveraign <HI>Mon∣tezuma</HI> Emperour of <HI>Mexico,</HI> to whom the Governour sent the Pictures of these bearded Men, their Horses, Apparel, Weapons, great Guns, and other Rari∣ties, Painted in Cotton Cloths, with an account of their Ships and numbers, which were conveyed by Posts to <HI>Mexico</HI> in a day and a night, though two hundred and ten Miles distant.</P>
<P><HI>Cortes</HI> asked the Governour whether <HI>Montezuma</HI> had any Gold, who answered him, <HI>yea, I am very glad of it,</HI> said <HI>Cortes, for I and my Companions are troubled with a Disease at the Heart, to which Gold is the only Soveraign Re∣medy, and therefore we desire him to furnish us with the great∣est quantity he can possible of that Mettal. Montezuma</HI> upon receipt of those things, sent back Cotton Cloths of di∣vers Colours, many tuffts of Feathers; with two Wheels, each two yards and an half broad, one of Sil∣ver representing the Moon, the other of Gold like the Sun, the whole Present being in value Twenty Thousand Duckets; he likewise exprest much Joy to hear of so great a Prince, and such a strange People, and promised all kind of necessaries, but was very unwilling <HI>Cortes</HI> should come to visit him, though <HI>Cortes</HI> was resolved to see him; the <HI>Indians</HI> came daily to his Camp, to see these strange sights, and when the great Guns were discharged, they fell flat on their Faces, thinking the Heavens were falling; among the rest were divers <HI>In∣dians</HI> of differing habit, taller than the rest, the Gristles of their Noses slit, and hanging over their Mouths, and Rings of Jet and Amber fastned thereto; they had holes in their lower Lips, wherein were put Rings of

Gold, and Turkess Stones, so heavy, that their Lips hung over their Chins, leaving their Teeth bare; <HI>Cor∣tes</HI> understood these deformed Gallants were of <HI>Zempo∣allan,</HI> a City a days Journey off, whom their Lords had sent to discover what Gods were come in those Tem∣ples (meaning the Ships) for they daily expected the God of the Air to appear. They were not willingly subject to <HI>Montezuma,</HI> neither converst with any other <HI>Indians,</HI> and therefore <HI>Cortes</HI> resolved to make use of them against him, upon the first occasion.</P>
<P>He sailed from thence to <HI>Panuco,</HI> a little Town, where was a Temple ascended by twenty Steps, in which they found Idols, Bloody Papers, much Blood of Men Sacrificed, the Block whereon they cut them up, and the Razors of Flint wherewith they opened their Breasts, which struck horror into the <HI>Spaniards; Cortes</HI> then proceeded to <HI>Zempoallan,</HI> where he was So∣lemnly received, and lodged in a great House of Lime and Stone, whited with Plaister that shined like Silver against the Sun; then causing all his Ships to be sunk, that there might be no hope of return, he persuaded the Natives to submit to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and join with them against <HI>Montezuma,</HI> which they readily complied with; leaving a Guard in this his new Town, he march∣ed with four hundred <HI>Spaniards,</HI> fifteen Horses, six pieces of Artillery, and thirteen hundred <HI>Indians</HI> to <HI>Zaclotan,</HI> whereof <HI>Olintler</HI> was Governour for <HI>Monte∣zuma,</HI> who to testify his Joy; and Honour <HI>Cortes</HI> com∣manded fifty men to be Sacrificed, whose Blood lay fresh upon the Ground, and his People carried the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> in triumph upon their Shoulders; he boasted as much of the power of <HI>Montezuma,</HI> as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did of their Emperour affirming that he had 30 Vassals, or petty Kings under him, each of whom were able to bring an hundred Thousand Souldiers into the Field, and then <HI>Montezuma</HI> Sacrificed some years Fifty Thou∣sand Men to his Gods; this was a great Town, having 13 Temples, in each of which were Idols of Stone of several fashions, before whom they Sacrificed Men,
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>
Doves, Quails, and other things, with Perfumes and great Veneration; here <HI>Montezuma</HI> had five Thousand Men in Garrison.</P>
<P><HI>Cortes</HI> went from hence toward <HI>Mexico,</HI> passing by the Frontiers of <HI>Taxallan,</HI> who were Enemies to the <HI>Mexicans,</HI> and whom <HI>Montezuma</HI> might easily have sub∣dued, but reserved partly to keep his Subjects in conti∣nual Exercises of War, and partly to Sacrifice them to his Gods; these <HI>Taxallans</HI> raised an hundred and fifty Thousand Men against <HI>Cortes,</HI> judging him to be a Friend and Confederate of <HI>Montezuma's,</HI> and yet they every day sent the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Guinney-cocks and Bread, as well to espy his strength, as that they scorned to ob∣scure their Glory, by Conquering People already star∣ved; but when in many Skirmishes, they could not prevail against that small handful of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they then believed them to be preserved by Inchantments, and sent <HI>Cortes</HI> three Presents with this threefold Mes∣sage; 1. <HI>That if he were that cruel God, who eateth Mans F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esh, he should eat those five Slaves which they had now sent, and then they would bring him more.</HI> 2. <HI>If he were the meek and gentle Deity, they then presented him with Frank∣incense and Feathers.</HI> 3. <HI>If he were a Mortal, then let him take and eat Bread, Fowl and Cherries;</HI> but at length they submitted, and delivered <HI>Taxallan</HI> to him, a great City by a Rivers side, having four Streets, each of which had their Captain in time of War; their Government was by the Nobility, under which were 28 Villages containing above an hundred and fifty Thousand Hous∣holds, the Men very Valiant, though very Poor; there was one Market-Place so large, that thirty Thousand People came thither daily to exchange Commodities, for Money they had none.</P>
<P><HI>Montezuma</HI> had formerly promised, whatever Tri∣bute the King of <HI>Spain</HI> should desire, and now he sent again to <HI>Cortes,</HI> not to depend on the beggerly Friend∣ship of the <HI>Taxallans,</HI> and they on the contrary advised him to repose no trust in <HI>Montezuma;</HI> however <HI>Cortes</HI> resolved for <HI>Mexico,</HI> and accompanied with many <HI>Tax∣allans,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>
went to <HI>Cholola,</HI> at which place the <HI>Spaniards</HI> re∣ported <HI>Montezuma</HI> had prepared an Army to surprise them, whereupon they used very great severity against them; (though it was said they had Sacrificed 10 Chil∣dren, of both Sexes, of three years old to their God for success,) for all the chief Men and Priests coming to meet and entertain them, they made them all Prisoners, and afterward cut them off, some being tyed to Stakes and burnt to death, and others suffered great Tortures; the Chief Commander escaped with about 30 or 40 Men, and got into a Temple which was like a Castle, there defending himself a good part of the day, but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> firing the Temple, burnt them all within it, who as they were dying, broke forth into these Lamentations; <HI>O Wicked Men! How have we injured you, that you should thus torment us? away, away to</HI> Mexico, <HI>where our Chief Lord</HI> Montezuma <HI>will revenge our Quarrel.</HI> It is reported, that while the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were acting this Bloody Tragedy, upon above six Thousand Innocent Creatures, their Chief Captain in sport sung these Verses.</P>
<Q><L>One flame the <HI>Roman</HI> City now destroys,</L>
<L>And Shreeks of People make a dismal noise,</L>
<L>While <HI>Nero</HI> sung, and (moved with delight)</L>
<L>From <HI>Tarpey</HI> Hill beheld the woful sight.</L></Q>
<P>Eight Leagues from <HI>Cholola</HI> is <HI>Popocatapec,</HI> a burning Mountain, the mouth whereof is about half a League in compass, from whence issued out great quantities of Fire, Smoak and Ashes, with terrible noise, the <HI>Indians</HI> believed it to be Hell, wherein wicked Men were punish∣ed; two <HI>Spaniards</HI> adventured near it, but narrowly escaped being destroyed, being sheltred by a Rock from the violent Eruption which then happened, which is sometimes so furious, that the fiery ashes are carried 15 Leagues off, burning their Corn, Fruits, Herbs, and Clothes on the Hedges; The <HI>Indians</HI> kissed the Gar∣ments of these adventurous <HI>Spaniards,</HI> an honour only
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>
given to their Gods. <HI>Cortes</HI> drawing near <HI>Mexico, Mon∣tezuma</HI> was much afraid, saying, <HI>These are the men whom our Gods told us should inherit our Land;</HI> He then shut up himself eight days in his Oratory, praying and fasting, and sacrificing many men to appease his offended Dei∣ties; The Oracle or Devil bids him not fear, but to continue these inhumane massacres, assuring him he should have two Gods to preserve him, saying, that <HI>Quezal</HI> permitted that great destruction at <HI>Cholola,</HI> for want of that bloudy Sacrifice.</P>
<P><HI>Cortes</HI> went forward passing over a Mountain six miles in height, covered with Snow continually, and the pas∣sage very difficult, so that the <HI>Mexicans</HI> might easily have prevented his proceeding further; from hence he had sight of the Lake whereon <HI>Mexico,</HI> and many other great Towns were built, filled with Inhabitants, and adorned with divers Temples and Towers, which beautify the Lake; being arrived at <HI>Mexico, Montezuma</HI> received him with all kind of solemnity, excusing his former unkindnesses, and providing all necessaries for him and his <HI>Spaniards,</HI> making Beds of Flowers for their Horses instead of Litter, but <HI>Cortes</HI> being full of Ambi∣tious designs, seized upon the King, and put him in chains with a <HI>Spanish</HI> Guard of 80 men, whereupon <HI>Montezuma</HI>'s Nephew fled to arms, but by the Treache∣ry of his own People, was presented to <HI>Montezuma,</HI> whom <HI>Cortes</HI> permitted to exercise Regal Authority, and by whose order he summoned a Parliament, or Assembly of the chief of his People, where he made an Oration to his Subjects, declaring, <HI>That he and his Predecessors were not naturally born in the Countrey, but that his Fore-Fa∣thers came from a strange Land, and that their Kings of old, had promised to send such as should rule them, and had accord∣ingly sent these Spaniards.</HI> He therefore advised them to yield themselves Vassals to the Emperour of <HI>Spain.</HI> This request they yielded to, though with many tears on either side in thus forever departing from their Liberty. <HI>Montezuma</HI> then presented <HI>Cortes</HI> a vast quan∣tity of Gold and Jewels, in the nature of a Tribute,
<PB N="14" REF="10"/>
valued at sixteen hundred thousand Castellins.</P>
<P>Hitherto <HI>Cortes</HI> had obtained a continual victory without fighting, when he had Intelligence that <HI>Pam∣philo de Narva,</HI> and some hundreds of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> were sent from <HI>Velasques</HI> another <HI>Spanish</HI> Captain, to interrupt his proceedings, who leaving two hundred of his Men in <HI>Mexico,</HI> he with two hundred and fifty others, suddenly surprized <HI>Narva</HI> and his company, and brought him Prisoner to <HI>Mexico;</HI> While this was doing, one of <HI>Cortes</HI> his Captains at <HI>Mexico</HI> resolved to perform something in his absence, which might render the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI> dreadful &amp; terrible to the <HI>Indians,</HI> a policy they often used; it happened that the Nobility &amp; Commons of the City, used all kind of sports &amp; recreations, to divert their Captive King, and none more than dancing and revel∣ling all night long in the streets, in which divertisements they brought forth all their Wealth, Richest Garments, and whatever they esteem'd precious; The Nobility and Princes of the Royal-Bloud, exercised themselves here∣in, near the Houses where their King was confined, there being above Two Thousand youths, even the flower of the Nobility ingaged therein. The <HI>Spanish</HI> Captain came with a small party of Souldiers, as if to be Spectators, sending more Troops into other parts of the City, giv∣ing them Command to be ready at a certain signal, and then leading the way, he himself cryed out aloud, St. <HI>Jago, let us fall upon them;</HI> The watchword thus given, the Souldiers began to cut and mangle those noble and delicate youths, with such fury, that they left not one alive, and their rich Garments and Jewels, were made a prize by the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> beholding this unheard of cruelty and in∣justice, having long endured with patience, the impri∣sonment of their King, who had charged them to be quiet, now fly all to arms, and falling upon the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI> wounded many, and pursued others, at length putting a dagger to the breast of their King <HI>Montezuma,</HI> they threatned to kill him, unless he would look out atth Window, and Command his Subjects to lay down thei
<PB N="15" REF="10"/>
Arms; But they contemning his Orders, chose them∣selves a Captain; when <HI>Cortes</HI> returned again, in good time to relieve his men, and <HI>Montezuma</HI> being again commanded by his <HI>Spanish</HI> Guardians to speak to the People, he was wounded on the Temples by a stone, whereof he died 3 daies after. <HI>Cortes</HI> had some Thousands of <HI>Taxallans</HI> to assist him, and yet was forced to fly out of <HI>Mexico</HI> privately by night, with all his <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> which yet was not unknown by the <HI>Mexicans,</HI> so that an alarm being raised, they cut off their Bridges, and made a great slaughter among them, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> losing most of their ill got Treasure; And their num∣ber increasing to two hundred thousand, they pursued them with all speed, but <HI>Cortes</HI> having the good fortune to kill their Standard-bearer, the <HI>Indians</HI> forsook the Field.</P>
<P>The <HI>Taxallans</HI> raising an Army of fifty thousand men, joined with <HI>Cortes,</HI> and took in divers places, and then building several Frigots or Brigantines, he soon took all the <HI>Indian</HI> Canoes upon the Lake. <HI>Quabutimoc,</HI> who suc∣ceeded <HI>Montezuma,</HI> being incouraged from the Devils Oracle, made all possible defence for saving <HI>Mexico,</HI> sometimes conquering, and being other while beaten by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who fired a great part of the City. One day the <HI>Mexicans</HI> having gotten an advantage against the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they thereupon celebrated a Feast of Victory; The Priests going into the Temple, made a Perfume of sweet Gums, and then sacrified for∣ty <HI>Spanish</HI> Prisoners, opening their breasts, plucking out their hearts, and sprinkling their bloud in the Air, their companions looking on, unable to revenge it, the <HI>Mexicans</HI> mean while, dancing, beating their drums, drinking themselves drunk, and using all manner of ex∣pressions of Joy. At length Rage, Revenge and Disdain had so filled the <HI>Spaniards</HI> breasts, that having hitherto been more careful of ruining the City, which they ho∣ped to preserve for their own use, they now resolved ut∣terly to destroy it, to which the dreadful Famine and Pestilence within, did as much contribute, as their Fury
<PB N="16" REF="11"/>
without; so that after three months Siege, <HI>Mexico</HI> is ta∣ken, and rased to the ground, with the loss of Fifty <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI> and Six Horses; but of the <HI>Mexicans,</HI> an hundred thousand, besides those who died of the Plague and Hunger; the King himself being taken Prisoner, and that mighty City and State utterly subverted; this hap∣pened <HI>Aug.</HI> 13. 1521. which day is kept as a yearly Festival by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to this day. <HI>Mexico</HI> was after∣ward rebuilt, with an hundred thousand Houses, fairer and stronger than before.</P>
<P>Thus fell the Great <HI>Montezuma</HI> and his mighty Empire with him; Thus fell he who was honoured as a God, whom it was death for any of the Common People to look in the face, who never set his foot on the ground abroad, but was carried upon the shoulders of Noblemen in a Chariot of pure Gold, and if he hap∣pened to alight, trod upon rich Tapestry; He who never put on one Garment twice, never us'd any Ves∣sel or Dish, though of Gold, but once, and yet all these Magnificences were so far from procuring him happi∣ness, that they were the chief incentives to covetous and ambitious Spirits to contrive his Ruin. Yet was not this general Devastation without some prodigous forerunners of the same. The King of <HI>Tescuco,</HI> a great Magician, and divers other Sorcerers, confirmed the declaration of the Idol <HI>Cholola; That a strange People should come and possess his Kingdom;</HI> These Sorcerers being imprisoned by the King, immediately vanished away; But a stranger thing happened by report to a poor man, who was taken up by an Eagle, and carried into a certain Cave, where being set down, the Eagle pro∣nounced these words, <HI>Most mighty Lord, I have brought him whom thou hast commanded;</HI> There he saw one like <HI>Montezuma</HI> lying asleep, who uttering several dreadful threatnings against the King, the man was again carried away by the Eagle, and set down in the place where he had been first seized. Strange voices were like∣wise heard, with Earth quakes and overflowings of Rivers; A prodigious Bird of the bigness of a Crane,
<PB N="17" REF="11"/>
was taken, having on his head as it were a Glass re∣presenting armed men, which being brought into the Kings presence, instantly disappeared, and was never seen after; The King endeavoured to have appeased his Gods by Sacrifice, and would therefore have re∣moved a great Stone, which yet he could not possibly do, by any strength or other means he used, which was thought to be an Ominous presage, that his Deities were not to be reconci∣led. These things were certainly told by the <HI>Indians,</HI> which if true, may be accounted the Illusions of the Devil, whereby he somtimes, forwarns his Votaries.</P>
<P N="3">III. Neither ought <HI>Americus Vespusius,</HI> a <HI>Florentine,</HI> to be forgotten, who was Second to <HI>Columbus</HI> in the glory of this grand and successful enterprize of discovering the <HI>New World,</HI> who at the charge of <HI>Emanuel</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> undertook the business; He had been one of <HI>Columbus</HI> his Companions in the first expedition, and consequently did now but trace the way that <HI>Columbus</HI> had before shewed him, yet had he this happiness and Honour above his Predecessor, to give his name unto the discovered Country; the whole continent of the <HI>New World</HI> being ever since from him generally called <HI>America;</HI> this man at the charge of King <HI>Emanuel</HI> in 1502. with a competent number of Ships and men crossed the Equinoctial Line, and discovered the Coasts of <HI>Guiana</HI> and <HI>Brasil,</HI> beyond the Tropique of Capri∣corn, to 32 degrees of Southern Latitude, where hav∣ing stay'd some time, and taken possession of the Countrey after their usual Formalities, they held on their course beyond the River of <HI>Plate,</HI> to 52 degrees, to the height of the Streights of <HI>Magellane,</HI> but being here taken with foul weather, and their Ships much impaired by Storms, they were forced to return homeward by the Coast of <HI>Africa.</HI> The year follow∣ing he attempted another Voyage, directing his course for <HI>Insula Real▪</HI> in the Country of <HI>Brasil;</HI> but having passed <HI>Cape Verde</HI> and <HI>Sierra Liona,</HI> upon the Coast of <HI>Guinney,</HI> by great misfortune the Ship which car∣ried

their Provisions was sunk, and 300 Hogsheads of Victuals and other necessaries, for the Company were utterly lost, by which disaster they were forced again to turn homeward; how long he lived, and what ex∣peditions he made after this, are not remembred in History.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>Francis Pizarro,</HI> a Person of very mean birth and E∣ducation, was likewise very fortunate in discoveries, for going from <HI>Sivil</HI> in <HI>Spain</HI> where he was born, to the <HI>Indies,</HI> he went in company of <HI>Almagro</HI> and others, to discover the South-sea in 1526. <HI>Pizarro</HI> offering to land his men, was wounded, and forced to retire to his Ships. <HI>Almagro</HI> in another place had better success, the <HI>Indians</HI> using him kindly, and presenting him three thousand Duckets of Gold, but endeavouring to land in that place of <HI>Pizarro's</HI> misfortune, he was set upon by the <HI>Indians,</HI> and lost one of his eyes in the encounter. At length they met at <HI>Panama,</HI> and having cured their wounds, and recruited their Forces with two hundred men, and many Slaves, they set sail, and landed at another place, but are beaten back to their Ships, and forced to an Island called <HI>Gorgon,</HI> six miles from the Continent, where <HI>Pizarro</HI> stay'd while <HI>Almagro</HI> went back for greater supplies, but both he and his compa∣ny were almost starved before <HI>Almagro's</HI> return; be∣ing refreshed and strengthned, they once more attempt the <HI>Indian</HI> Shore, but were again repelled both from thence and the Island, so that they resolved to go further, coursing this Land and their ill fortune and having sailed five hundred miles, they came to <HI>Chira</HI> a Province in <HI>Perue,</HI> and having Intelligence by some of the Natives of the great wealth of this Countrey, <HI>Pi∣zarro</HI> sent one <HI>Peter</HI> a <HI>Candian</HI> on shore, who was kind∣ly treated by the Governor, by whom he was shewed a Temple dedicated to the Sun, wherein were inestimable riches, whereupon it was agreed among the Partners in this Enterprize, that <HI>Pizarro</HI> should return to <HI>Spain</HI> and get a License for this Conquest, which he did ac∣cordingly, but yet only for himself, absolutely leaving his

Companions out of the Grant, and returning with Letters Pattents to <HI>Panama</HI> with his four brethren <HI>Hernando, Gonzalo, John,</HI> and <HI>Martin de Alcantara</HI> his brother by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Mothers side, his Partners were much disturbed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hereat; however, after much quarelling, <HI>Pizarro</HI> and <HI>Al∣magro</HI> agreed to make an equal division of their booty; <HI>Pizarro</HI> goes before with an hundred and fifty Soul∣diers, (ordering <HI>Almagro</HI> to follow with all the strength <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e could make) and Lands in <HI>Peru,</HI> a River so called, which gave name to those great and wealthy Provinces; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey went by Land, enduring much misery by the way, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill they came to <HI>Puna,</HI> where they were well received of the Governor, till by abusing their Wives, they pro∣voked the <HI>Indians</HI> to take Arms, but were soon defeated, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd thereby their Riches became a prey to the prevail∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>The Governor of this Island, to satisfy his Jealousy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut off the Noses, Privy Members, and Arms of his Eunuchs. Here <HI>Pizarro</HI> heard first of <HI>Atabaliba,</HI> for the Governor taking part with <HI>Guascar Atabaliba's</HI> Brother, who were at that time at War, about the Soveraignty of the Kingdom, he had taken six hundred of his Ene∣mies Prisoners, who now coming into <HI>Pizarro</HI>'s hands, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e freely sent them to <HI>Tumbez,</HI> a great <HI>Indian</HI> Town be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onging to <HI>Atabaliba,</HI> and three Messengers with them to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emand peace and safe entrance; but notwithstanding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Captives were so generously restored, they in∣gratefully delivered the three <HI>Spaniards</HI> to their bloudy Priests to be sacrificed to the Idol of the Sun Upon this <HI>Pizarro</HI> took <HI>Tumbez,</HI> and plunder'd the Temple and City; From thence he marches toward <HI>Guatimala,</HI> where <HI>Guascar</HI> sent some with great promises to desire his aid against his Brother; Soon after others came from <HI>Atabaliba,</HI> with a peremptory command that he should return back to his Ships. <HI>Pizarro</HI> answered, <HI>That he came thither not to hurt any, but for their good, as his Lord and Emperour had given him in charge, nor could he now return without much dishonour, being an Ambassador from the Pope and Emperor, who were Lords of the World, before he had
<PB N="20" REF="13"/>
seen King</HI> Atabaliba<HI>'s Royal Person, and bad communicated to him such wholsome Counsels and Instructions as might be good both for his body and Soul.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pizarro</HI> passed forward, and as he went through the Province of <HI>Chira,</HI> the Lords thereof provoked him a∣gainst <HI>Atabaliba,</HI> who had lately conquered their Coun∣treys; these Civil distractions did much facilitate the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Victories; on the River <HI>Chira</HI> he setled the Colony of St. <HI>Michael</HI> for securing his Spoils, and then marcht on to <HI>Guatimala,</HI> sending Messengers on Horse∣back to give notice of his coming; the <HI>Indians</HI> having never before seen an Horse, were extreamly surprised, but <HI>Atabaliba</HI> was little moved thereat, though very much concerned that those Bearded Men afforded him such small Reverence, and Respect; he sent <HI>Pizarro</HI> a Pair of Shoes cut and Gilded, under pretence of distin∣guishing, and knowing him from others, though it was judged a design to seize and kill him. The next day the King was carried in Solemn Triumph upon the Shoul∣ders of his Nobility in great Pomp and Magnificence, Guarded with Twenty five Thousand <HI>Indians;</HI> when <HI>Vincent</HI> a <HI>Dominican</HI> Frier, coming before him with great Reverence, holding a Cross in one hand, and his Bre∣viary, or as some say, a Bible, in the other, he blessed him with the Cross, and said, <HI>Most Excellent Prince, it much concerns you to believe, that God in Trinity and Ʋnity Created the World out of nothing, and Formed a Man of the Earth whom he called</HI> Adam, <HI>of whom we had all our be∣ginning, that</HI> Adam <HI>sinned against his Creator by disobedi∣ence, and in him all his Posterity, except Jesus Christ, who being God, came down from Heaven, and took the flesh of the Virgin</HI> Mary, <HI>and to save and redeem Mankind, dyed upon a Cross like to this in my hand, for which cause we worship it. After his death he rose again the third day, and after forty days ascended into Heaven, leaving for his Vicar on Earth St.</HI> Pe∣ter <HI>and his Successors, which we call Popes, one of whom hath now given the most Puissant King of</HI> Spain <HI>Emperor of the</HI> Romans, <HI>the Monarchy of the World. Obey the Pope therefore, worthy Prince, and receive the faith of Christ, which if you
<PB N="21" REF="13"/>
will believe to be most Holy, and your own most false, you shall do well, but know, that if you do the contrary, we will make War upon you, and destroy and break your Idols to pieces; Let me then advise you to leave off your false worship, and thereby prevent all these mischiefs.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Atabaliba</HI> seemed to wonder at the Preaching of this Frier, and replied, <HI>That he was a free Prince, and would become Tributary to none, neither did he acknowledg any greater Lord than himself; As for the Emperour he could be well content to be in friendship with so great a Monarch, and to be acquainted with him, but for the Pope, he would not obey him, who gave away what was none of his own, and took a Kingdom from him whom he had never seen; As for Religion he liked well his own, neither would nor ought he to question the Truth thereof, it being so ancient and approved, especially since Christ died, which never happened to the Sun and Moon whom he worshipped. And how do you know,</HI> said he, <HI>that the God of the Christians created the World?</HI> Fier <HI>Vincent</HI> answered, <HI>That his book told it him,</HI> giving him his Breviary or Bible, <HI>Atabaliba</HI> looked in it, and said, <HI>It told him no such thing,</HI> throwing it on the ground; The Frier took it up, and went to <HI>Pizarro,</HI> cry∣ing out, <HI>He hath cast the Gospels on the Ground, Revenge it O Christians upon these Infidel Dogs, and since they will not accept our friendship nor our Law, let as utterly destroy them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pizarro</HI> hereupon set up his Standard, and planted his Ordinance, and his Horsemen in 3 Squadons as∣sulted <HI>Atabaliba</HI>'s people, making great slaughter, <HI>Pizarro</HI> himself with his Foot came in, and did much execution with their swords, all charged against <HI>Atabaliba,</HI> killing them who carried him on their Shouldiers in his Pavil∣lion, whose Rooms were presently supplied by others, till at last <HI>Pizarro</HI> pluckt him down by his Cloaths; All the while not one <HI>Indian</HI> made resistance, either because they had no Command, or with the amaze∣ment to see their Soveraign so abused, so that never a <HI>Spainar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> was slain, though several <HI>Indians</HI> were thurst through; thus were the <HI>Indians</HI> routed, their King and other rich spoyls remaining to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> reckoned
<PB N="22" REF="14"/>
at fourscore thousand Castilians in Gold, and Seven Thousand Marks in Silver, of the houshold Plate of <HI>Atabaliba,</HI> every Mark being eight Ounces; And in <HI>Guatimala</HI> they found several Houses filled up to the roof with rich Garments, besides Armour and Wea∣pons, of which some were Axes and Pole-axes of Gold and Silver. The next day the <HI>Spaniards</HI> searcht all about for spoil, and found five thousand women be∣longing to the King, with much Treasure.</P>
<P><HI>Atabaliba</HI> was much disturbed at his imprisonment, but especially because they put a chain upon him, and when many proposals had been made about his ran∣som, a Souldier said, <HI>If you will give us this House full of Gold and Silver thus high,</HI> (lifting up his Sword, and making a mark upon the wall) <HI>you shall have your Free∣dom; Atabaliba,</HI> promised if they would give him Li∣berty to send throughout his Kingdom, he would fulfil their demand, whereat the <HI>Spaniards</HI> amazed, gave him three months time, but he had filled the House in two months and an half, a thing hardly to be credited; but saith <HI>Lopez Vaz,</HI> I know above twenty men who were there at that time, and all affirmed that there was above ten Millions of Gold and Silver. Another <HI>Spanish</HI> Captain relates that <HI>Atabaliba</HI> promised to give them so much Gold, as should reach up to a Mark which was a span higher than a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all man could reach, the room being 25 Foot long and 15 wide, and the Go∣vernor demanding how much Silver he would give, he said, he would fill up a large inclosed Garden, with Vessels of Pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e for his ransom; this Captain was made Guardian of this Golden House and saw this vast mass of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> melted down; the Govern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> sent a fifth pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, giving to eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Footman which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> two, four tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> eight hundred <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> which amount∣ed to abov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seven <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Hors∣man 63 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> ad∣va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> he Victor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> thousand <HI>Pezo's</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o

thousand to the Inhabitants of St. <HI>Michael;</HI> Many other gifts he gave to Merchants and others, and yet after the Governor was gone, there was more Gold brought in, than that which had been shared; Ten or twelve days, after the <HI>Spaniards</HI> who were sent to <HI>Cusco,</HI> brought in as much Gold, as amounted to two Millions and an half, and half a million of Silver; When <HI>Ataba∣liba</HI> had procured this immense sum, he was discharg∣ed from his promise by sound of Trumpet, and yet was still kept under a Guard for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> security, under pretence that his Subjects were again gathered together by his Command, he argued with them, that if they were assembled together, it was no more by his Authority, than the moving of the Leaves of the Trees, but however, being their Captive, he said, it was in their power to take away his Life.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding these so reasonable Remonstrances, they consulted whether they should burn him alive, and at last Condemned him to that cruel death, but by the intreaty of some, that Sentence was mitigated, and he was ordered to be strangled by four <HI>Negro</HI>'s, whom <HI>Pizarro</HI> kept for that purpose, which one night was ac∣cordingly performed; the King understanding he was to dye, spake thus to his Murderers, <HI>Why do you kill me? Did not you promise to set me at liberty, if I would give you Gold? I procured it for you, yea, more than you required, yet if it be your pleasure that I must be killed, send me to your King of</HI> Spain, <HI>that I may clear myself of what you falsly ob∣ject against me;</HI> but the Executioners stopt his Breath before he could proceed further, yet did not venge∣ance suffer these Ingrateful Villains to escape. <HI>Almagro</HI> was Executed by order of <HI>Pizarro,</HI> and young <HI>Almagro</HI> slew <HI>Pizarro,</HI> who was likewise put to death by <HI>de Cas∣tro John Pizarro</HI> was slaughtered by the <HI>Indians, Mar∣tin</HI> and <HI>Francis,</HI> two other of his Brethren were like∣wise killed; <HI>Ferdinand</HI> was imprisoned in <HI>Spain,</HI> and his end unknown; <HI>Gonzales</HI> was put to death by <HI>Gasca,</HI> and the Civil Wars among themselves utterly de∣stroyed the rest of these Treacherous <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="15"/>The difference between the two Brethren accelera∣ted their Ruin, <HI>Guascar</HI> succeeded his Father in the Kingdom, and the Province of <HI>Quito</HI> was assigned to <HI>Atabaliba,</HI> who being of an aspiring Spirit, seized on <HI>Tumebamba</HI> a rich Province, upon which his Brother raising Forces, took him Prisoner; <HI>Atabaliba</HI> making his escape, got back to <HI>Quito,</HI> where he made his Peo∣ple believe that their God the Sun, had turned him in∣to a Serpent, and thereby he got through a hole in the Prison; the conceit of this Miracle, made them instantly rise in Arms against <HI>Guascar,</HI> with whose assistance <HI>Atabaliba</HI> made such Slaughter of his Enemies, that there are great heaps of Bones to be seen at this day, Threescore Thousand being killed, and many Provinces Conquered; during <HI>Atabaliba</HI>'s Imprison∣ment, some of his Captains had taken his Brother <HI>Guascar,</HI> who sent word to one of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Comman∣ders, that if he would restore him to his Liberty and Kingdom, he would fill up a large Room at <HI>Guatimala</HI> with Gold and Silver, which was thrice as much as <HI>Atabaliba</HI> had promised, adding, that his Father <HI>Guay∣na,</HI> who was a great Sorcerer, had commanded him on his Death-bed to be kind to the white and Bearded Men, who should come and rule in those parts; <HI>Ataba∣liba</HI> hearing of these offers, sent to have his Brother put to death, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> took no notice of, and which seemed justly to befall him, since he had before Murthered another of his Brethren, and drunk in his Skull, as he had sworn to deal with <HI>Atabaliba.</HI></P>
<P>Though the <HI>Spaniards</HI> got vast Treasures in this Countrey, yet the <HI>Indians</HI> hid great quantities of Gold, Silver and Jewels, which never came to their hands, formerly belonging to <HI>Guayna:</HI> one of <HI>Atabaliba</HI>'s Chief Captains visited him in Prison with great reverence, he and the chief of his Company, laying Burdens on their Shoulders, and so entred into his presence▪ lift∣ing up their hands to the Sun, with great thankfulness for giving them sight of their Lord, and then kneeling down, kissed his hands and feet; this Captain told the

<HI>Spaniards,</HI> that an <HI>Indian</HI> had conveyed away vast Trea∣sures, and upon Torture discovered a great House full of Vessels of Gold, with a Shepherd and his Sheep all of Gold, as great as if living; he likewise reported he heard <HI>Atabaliba</HI> say, that in an Island called <HI>Collas,</HI> was a very great House covered all over with Gold, the Ceilings, Walls and Pavements within, being likewise all Beaten Gold; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> so abounded in Gold, that they would give a Thousand or fifteen hundred Pezo's for an Horse; Debtors sought out their Creditors with <HI>Indians</HI> loaden with Gold, from House to House to pay them; they took from the Walls of some Houses, and the Roof of the Temple at <HI>Cusco,</HI> Plates of Gold of ten or twelve Pound weight, they carried into <HI>Spain</HI> one Vessel of Gold, and another of Silver, each of so vast extent, as they were big enough to boil a Cow whole therein, likewise a huge Eagle, an Image of Gold, as long as a Child of four years old, Drums, and Statues of Women in Gold to the full proportion; with several others of Silver, Sheep of fine Gold curi∣ously wrought, and other admirable Rarities.</P>
<P>In this Kingdom of <HI>Peru</HI> is an High Mountain called <HI>Periacaca,</HI> upon which <HI>Joseph Acosta</HI> ascended as well provided as possible, being sensible of the Danger, but in the ascent he and his Companions were sudden∣ly, surprized with looseness and Vomiting, casting up Flegm, Choler and Bloud, so that they expected pre∣sent death. There are other Desarts in <HI>Peru</HI> called <HI>Pu∣nas,</HI> where the Air cuts off men without feeling, a small breath depriving them sometimes of their feet and hands, which fall off like leaves in Autumn, without pain, and other times of their Lives, and yet after death the same piercing cold Air preserves the body from Putrefaction.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> The Voyages and Discoveries of several <HI>Englishmen</HI> into <HI>America.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the former Chapter I have, according to my usual scantling, given a sufficient account of the Fortu∣nate Acquisitions of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and now think my self in justice obliged to let my Countrymen know what Adventurous Voyages, and extream dangers some of our brave <HI>English</HI> Spirits have surmounted in their Discoveries of this <HI>New World;</HI> wherein I shall follow the Sun, beginning first Northward, and so pro∣ceed toward, and beyond the Equinoctial.</P>
<P N="1">I. In which number, Sir <HI>Sebastian Cabot</HI> ought to be first mentioned, born and living in <HI>England,</HI> though a <HI>Venetian</HI> Gentleman by Extraction, who in 1496 at the charge of <HI>Henry</HI> the 7th King of <HI>England,</HI> set out with two Carravels, for discovering a Northwest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as∣sage to <HI>Cathay</HI> and the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> according to the de∣sign which <HI>Columbus</HI> had first suggested to him; in pursuit whereof, he is reported to have sailed to 67 Degrees of Northern Latitude, upon the Coast of <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> and finding Land, called it <HI>Prima Vista;</HI> the Inha∣bitants wore the Skins of Beasts, there were white Bears, and Stags far greater than ours, with great pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ty of Seal and Sole fish above a yard long, and such vast quantities of other Fish, that they sometimes staid the course of the Ship; the Bears caught these Fish with their Claws, and drawing them to Land, eat them;
<PB N="28" REF="18"/>
he then discovered all along the Coast to <HI>Florida,</HI> and afterward returned, at which time strong preparations being making for Wars with <HI>Scotland,</HI> this design was wholly laid aside to the great prejudice of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, who in all probability might have made them∣selves Quarter-masters, at least with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in the wealthiest Parts and Provinces of <HI>America,</HI> if the business had been well followed. Sir <HI>Sebastian</HI> himself went immediately to <HI>Spain,</HI> and was imployed by that King in discovering the Coasts of <HI>Brasil,</HI> and though he afterward returned again to <HI>England</HI> in 1549. and was honoured by King <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth, with the Title of <HI>Grand Pilot</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and the yearly Pension of an hundred and sixty Pound, yet his design was never effectually revived.</P>
<P N="2">II. Sir <HI>Martin Frobisher,</HI> justly deserves the second place, who in the reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> made three several voyages to discover the North-west Passage. <HI>June</HI> 15. 1576 he sailed from <HI>Blackwall,</HI> and <HI>July</HI> 7 had sight of <HI>Frizeland,</HI> but could not get ashoar, because of the abundance of Ice, and an extream Fog, <HI>July</HI> 20. he had sight of an High Land, which he named Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Foreland, very full of Ice, but sailing further Northward, he descried another Foreland with a Great Bay, whereinto he entred, calling it <HI>Frobishers Streights,</HI> supposing it to divide <HI>Asia</HI> from <HI>America;</HI> Having sailed sixty Leagues, he went ashore, and was encountred with mighty Deer, who ran at him, &amp; indan∣gered his Life. He had there a sight of the Savage In∣habitants, who rowed to his Ship in Boats of Seals Skins, they eat or rather devour raw Flesh and Fish, their hair was long and black, broad faces, flat noses, colour tawny or Olive, which neither Sun nor Wind, but nature it self imprinted on them, as appeared by their Infants, and seems to be the complexion of all the <HI>Americans;</HI> their clothing was Seals Skins, the wo∣men were painted on the Cheeks, and about the Eyes with blew streaks. These Savages intercepted 5 <HI>English∣men</HI> and their Boat, they took also one of them, whom
<PB N="29" REF="18"/>
they brought into <HI>England,</HI> where they arrived <HI>Oct.</HI> 2. 1576. having taken possession of the Country, in right of the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> every man of the company be∣ing commanded to bring home somewhat in witness thereof; one brought a piece of black stone like Sea∣coal, which was found to hold Gold in a good quantity.</P>
<P>Whereupon the next year a second voyage was made to bring home more of this Ore, and coming into these <HI>Streights</HI> in <HI>July</HI> 1577. they found them in a manner shut up with a long wall of Ice, which very much in∣dangered their Ships. They found a Fish as big as a Porpice dead upon the Shoar twelve foot long, hav∣ing a Horn of two yards growing out of the Snout, wreathed and streight like a wax tapor, &amp; was thought to be a Sea Unicorn; It was broken on the top, where∣in the Sailers affirmed they put Spiders which pre∣sently died. It was presented to the Queen at their return, and sent to <HI>Winsor</HI> to be reserved in the Wardrope for a curiosity. They went on Shoar, and had some skirmishes with the Inhabitants, who were so fierce and resolute, that finding themselves wound∣ed, they leapt off the Rocks into the Sea rather than fall into the hands of the <HI>English,</HI> the rest fled, only one Woman and her Child they brought away, and another man, who seeing the Picture of his Countrey∣man in the Ship that was taken the year before, thought him to be alive, and was very angry that he would not speak to him, wondring how our People could make men live or die at their pleasure. It was very pleasant to observe the behaviour of the man and woman when they were brought together; who though put into the same Cabbin, shewed such signs of Chastity, and Modesty, as might justly shame Christi∣ans who come so far short of them; when these Sava∣ges would trade, their manner was to lay down some∣what of theirs and go their ways, expecting the <HI>En∣glish</HI> should lay down something in exchange; if they like the value when they come again, they take it, otherwise they take away only their own; they made
<PB N="30" REF="19"/>
signs that their <HI>Catchoe</HI> or King was higher of stature than any of ours, and carried upon mens Shoulders. They could not hear what became of their five men ta∣ken the year before, only they found some of their Ap∣parel, which made them judge the Savages had eaten them; Having laden their Ship with Oar, they returned.</P>
<P>The next year 1578. with fifteen sail another Voyage was made by Captain <HI>Frobisher</HI> for further discovery. He went on shoar <HI>June</HI> 20 on <HI>Frizeland,</HI> which is in length about 25 Leagues, in 57 degrees of Latitude, which he named West <HI>England,</HI> where they espied certain Tents and People like the former, who upon their approach fled; in the Tents they found a Box of small Nails, red Herrings, and boards of Fir-tree, with other things wrought very Artificially, so that they were either ingenious workmen themselves, or traded with others; some think this to be <HI>Friesland,</HI> and joined to <HI>Greenland.</HI> In going from hence one Ship called the <HI>Salamander</HI> sailing with a strong gale, struck with such violence upon the back of a Whale with her full stem that she stood still without motion, whereat the Whale made a hideous roaring, and lifting up his body and tail above water, sunk instantly to the bottom; Two days after they found a dead Whale, which was supposed the same. <HI>July</HI> 2. they entred the Strieghts, the mouth where∣of was barr'd with Mountains of Ice, wherewith a Bark was sunk, with part of a house they designed to erect there, the men were all saved, and the other Ships in much danger by the severity of the Ice, Fogs, and Snow. These Islands of Ice seem to be congealed in the winter further North in some Bays or Rivers, the waters thereof being fresh, and the Sun melting the tops of the Ice rills of fresh water run down, which meeting together make an indifferent Stream; these Rocks being by the summers Sun loosed and broken from their natural Scituation, are carried whither the swift Current and the outragions Winds drive them.</P>
<P>Some of these Icy Rocks or Islands are half a mile about, and fourscore fathoms above water, besides the
<PB N="31" REF="19"/>
unknown depth beneath, the usual rule being, that only one part of seven is seen above water; strange is their multitude, more strange their deformed Shapes, but most strange, that instead of destroying, they some∣times save both men and Ships, suffering the mooring of Anchors, entertaining them with sports, as walking, leaping, shooting forty miles from Land without any Vessel or Ship under them, presenting them with run∣ning Streams of fresh water sufficient to drive a Mill. The People represent the <HI>Tartars</HI> in apparel and living. It is colder here in 62, than in ten degrees farther North, which happens from the cold North East Winds, which brings this sharp Air off the Ice; The Na∣tives are excellent Archers, they wear the Skins of Deer, Bears, Foxes, Hares, and of Fowls sowed toge∣ther; in the Summer the hary side outward, in the Winter inward, yet many go naked; they shoot Fish with their Darts, and kindle Fire by rubbing two sticks together; The Beasts, Fowls and Fishes they kill, are their Houses, Bedding, Meat, Drink, Hose, Shoes Apparel, Sails Boats, and indeed all their riches; they eat all things raw, yea Grass and Shrubs, and suck Ice to satisfy their thirst; there is no flesh or fish which they find dead, though never so filthy, but they will take it up and eat it, yet somtimes they parboil their meats in little kettles made of Beasts Skins, the bloud and water they drink, and lick the bloody Knife with their Tongues, and use the same remedy for cu∣ring their wounds, that is, licking them only with their Tongues.</P>
<P>They have great plenty of Fowl, our men killing 15 hundred in one day; they have thicker Skins, and more Feathers than ours, which requires them to be flea'd before eaten; They have no hurtful creeping things but Spiders, and a Gnat, which is very troublesom, nor any Timber but what the undermining water brings from other places; They are great Magicians, and when their heads ake, they tie a great Stone with a string into a stick, and using certain Charms, the
<PB N="32" REF="20"/>
Stone cannot be moved with all the force of a man, yet at other times seems as light as a Feather; they lie gro∣velling with their Faces on the Ground, making a noise as if they Worshiped the Devil under the Earth; they use great black Dogs like Wolves to draw their Sleds, and some of a lesser kind they feed upon. In the midst of Summer, they have Hail and Snow, some∣times a Foot thick, which Freezeth as it Falls, and the Ground is Frozen 3 Fathom deep, at which time the Sun is not absent above 3 hours and an half, during which it was so very light, that we could see to read. There are no Rivers or Running Springs, but what the Sun causes to come from the Snow. They Row in their Leather Boats faster with one Oar, than we can ours with all our Oars. They seem to have commerce with other Nations, from whom they have a small quantity of Iron.</P>
<P N="3">III. In 1585. Mr. <HI>John Davis</HI> made his first Voy∣age for the Northwest Discovery, and in 54 Degrees, they went on Shore on an Island where they saw divers Savages, who seem'd to Worship the Sun, pointing up to it with their Hands, and therewith striking their Breasts, the <HI>English</HI> answering them with the same Acti∣ons, they took it for a confirmed League and Agree∣ment between them, they then leaped and danced with a kind of Timbrel, which they struck with a stick, their Garments were the Skins of Birds and Beasts, they killed white Bears, one of whose Forefeet was fourteen Inches broad, and the Flesh so fat, they were forc't to throw it away; by their dung they seem'd to feed on Grass, which was like Horse-dung, they heard tame Dogs howl on the Shore, for killing one he had a Col∣lar about his Neck, he had a Bone in his Pizel, and seem'd inured to the Sled, two of which they found.</P>
<P>Next year Captain <HI>Davis</HI> made a second Voyage, and found the <HI>Savage</HI> People very tractable; they are great Idolaters and Witches, having many Images which they carried about them, and in their Boats; they found a Grave wherein many were buried, and cover∣ed
<PB N="33" REF="20"/>
with Seals Skins, with a Cross laid over them; they are very Thievish, eat raw Fish, Grass and Ice, and drink Salt Water; here they saw a Whirlwind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake up a great quantity of Water, which mounted vio∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ently into the Air three hours together with little in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ermission; In 63 Degrees they met with a vast Mass of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce in one piece, so very large, that it appeared like an Island, with Bays and Capes like a high Cliff Land, whereupon they sent their Pinnace to discover it, who found it to be only Ice, this was <HI>July</HI> 17. 1586. and they Coasted it till the 30th following. In 66 Degrees they found it very hot, and were much troubled with Musket to Flies; all the Coasts hereabout seemed bro∣ken Islands; then returning Southward, they Coasted <HI>Greenland,</HI> but were hindred from Harbour by the Ice, their Houses near the Seaside were made with pieces of Wood crossed over with Poles, and covered with Earth; our Men plaid at Football with the Islanders upon the Ice. Captain <HI>Davis</HI> his third Voyage was per∣formed the next year 1587. wherein he discovered to 73 Degrees, finding the Sea all open, and forty Lea∣gues between the Shore on each side, having <HI>Greenland</HI> on the East, and <HI>America</HI> on the West, near which was another Island, which for its dreadful aspect, being co∣vered with Snow, without Wood, Earth, or Grass to be seen; and the terrible noise of the Ice, he named the <HI>Isle of Desolation,</HI> but the untimely death of Sir <HI>Fran∣cis Walsingham,</HI> hindred the further Prosecution of these Discoveries.</P>
<P N="4">IV. In 1602. Captain <HI>George Weymouth</HI> set forth with two Flyboats at the charge of the <HI>Muscovy</HI> Company, to find out the Northwest Passage, he saw the South part of <HI>Greenland,</HI> the Water in an 120 Fathom was black as puddle, and suddenly clear again; the breach of the Ice made a noise like Thunder, and indanger∣ed the overturning both their Vessels; they had thick Fogs and Mists, which Froze as they fell; in 68 Degrees, they met with an inlet, Forty Leagues broad, and sailed therein an hundred Leagues West and by South.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="34" REF="21"/>V. In 1605. Captain <HI>James Hall</HI> Sailed to <HI>Greenland,</HI> and had the like Encounters of Ice, which made as much noise as five Cannons discharged at once; the People were like those mentioned by <HI>Frobisher,</HI> they make Sails of Guts sowed together, and deceive the Seals by raking them with their Seals Skin Garments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Countrey is high, Mountainous, and full of broken Islands along the Coasts, the Rivers are Navigable, and full of Fish, between the Mountains are such plea∣sant Plains and Valleys, as is hardly to be imagined in that cold Countrey. He saw store of Fowl, no Beasts but black Foxes and Deer. The Natives wander in Com∣panies in Summer for Hunting and Fishing, removing from one place to another, with their Families, Tents, and Baggage, they are of a reasonable Stature, Brown, Active and Warlike, eat their Meat either raw or par∣boil'd with Blood, Oil, or a little Water which they drink; their Arrows have two Feathers, and a Bone Head, they have no Wood, but what the Sea drives ashore. In 1606. He made a second Voyage thither, and found their Winter Houses Built with Whalebones, and covered with Earth, with Vaults two yards deep, and square underground. The next year he sailed thi∣ther a third time, and in a fourth Voyage, 1612. was Slain by a Savage, in revenge as was thought of some of theirs formerly carried away from thence. They have Hares as white as Snow, Dogs that live on Fish, their Pizles, as of their Foxes, being Bone; their work in Summer is to dry their Fish on the Rocks. Every Man and Woman hath a Boat made of long pieces of Fir, covered with Seals Skins, and sowed with Sinews and Guts, about 20 Foot long, and two and an half broad, like a Weavers Shuttle, so light and swift, that no Ship with any Wind is able to hold way with them, and yet use but one Oar, which they hold by the middle in the midst of their Boar, wherewith they Row forward and backward at pleasur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; they generally Worship the Sun, to which they pointed at the approach of the <HI>English,</HI> striking their Breasts and crying <HI>Ilyout,</HI> not

coming near till they had done the same; they bury their dead in their cloths on the tops of Hills in the midst of heaps of Stones, to preserve them from the Foxes, making another grave hard by wherein they place his Bow, Arrows, Darts, and other Utensils. The next year Mr. <HI>John Knight</HI> made a North-west Voyage, Io∣sing his Ship, which was sunk in the Ice, and was with three more of his company surprized by the Savages.</P>
<P N="6">VI. About this time three of our Countrymen na∣med <HI>Stephen Burrough,</HI> Mr. <HI>Pet.</HI> and Mr. <HI>Jackman,</HI> went toward the North-West touching upon the Northerly parts of <HI>Greenland,</HI> and sailed from 80 degrees to <HI>Nova Zembla;</HI> in one place they saw red Geese, and in ano∣ther blue Ice, but at length loosing their Ship by the Ice, they were forced to set up an House to winter in the <HI>Isle of Desolation;</HI> they began their bulding about the 10 of <HI>September,</HI> the cold even then kissing his Newcome Tenants so eagerly, that when the Carpenter did but put a nail into his mouth, the Ice would hang thereon, and the bloud followed in plucking it out. In <HI>December</HI> their Fire could not heat them, their Sack was frozen, &amp; they were forced to melt it, their Beer when thawed drunk like water; They endeavoured to reme∣dy it with Sea-coal fire, as being hotter than wood, and stopped the Chimney and Doors to keep in the heat, when they instantly swounded away for want of Air; Their Shoes froze as hard as horns to their feet, and when they sate at the fire while they were almost burnt on the forepart, they were frozen white on their backs; The Snow rose higher than the House, which in clear weather they endeavoured to remove, cutting out steps, and ascending up as out of a Vault or Cellar; when neither Cloths nor great fires would keep out the cold, they were forced to heat Stones and ap∣ply them burning hot to their feet and bodys; in one night a barrel of water was turned into Ice; They saw no Sun from <HI>November</HI> 3. to <HI>Jan.</HI> 24. a long night of fifty two days; When the Sun had left them, they saw the Moon continually day and night never going

down, the twilight likewise remaining several days, and they saw some daylight sixteen days before the re∣turn of the Sun; The Bears who had held them be∣seiged, and often endangered them, forsook them with the returning Sun; these Bears are very large and cruel, some of their Skins being thirteen foot long, and yeilding and hundred pound of fat, which served them for Oyl in their Lamps; the flesh they durst not eat, some of them losing all their own skin by eating a Bears Liver; they devour any thing, even their own kind; for having killed one with a Gun, another Bear carried it a great way over the Ice in his mouth, and then fell to eating it, whereupon making to him with their weapons, he fled, leaving his purchase half eaten, and four men could hardly carry the other half, when the whole body seemed to be very lightly carried by his fellow; The white Foxes continually visited them, of which they took many, whose flesh was good Veni∣son to them, and their Skins in the linings of their Caps a comfortable remedy against the extream cold; they used Pattens of wood with Sheepskins above, and many Socks and Soles under their feet, with shoes of Rug or Felt; Their Diet was very mean, but at length despairing of relief, they made them two open Scutes, wherein they sailed above a Thousand miles after ten months continuance in this disolate Habitation, and though incompassed with a thousand dangers from the Ice which surrounded them like Tents, Towns, and Fortifications, yet at length happily returned to their own Country; However, no further progress was made till the <HI>English</HI> several years after made more profitable Discoveries, and found in <HI>Greenland</HI> (not far off) a very beneficial Trade of Whale-fishing, which continues to this time.</P>
<P>Now, though this Countrey is reckoned to be in <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> and therefore out of our present survey, yet be∣ing so near adjacent, it may not be unpleasant to give a brief relation of an hunting spectacle, of the greatest chase which nature hath created; I mean, the killing
<PB N="37" REF="22"/>
of <HI>Whales;</HI> when they spy him on the top of the water, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o which he is often forced to get breath, they row to∣ward him in a Shallop, wherein the Harponier stands rea∣dy to dart his harping Iron with both his hands, to which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s fastened a line of such length, that the Whale finding himself wounded, and sinking to the bottom, may car∣ry it down with him, it being contrived the Shallop shall incur no danger thereby; when he rises, they strike him again with Lances about twelve foot long, the Iron being eight therof, and the blade eighteen inches, the harping Iron being chiefly intended only to fasten him to the Shallop, and thus they hold him in hot persuit, till after having cast up first Rivers of Water, and then of bloud, as being angry with both Elements, for suffering such weak hands to destroy him, he at length yields his slain Carcass a prey to the Conquerors; The Tragedy is thus exprest by the Poet.</P>
<Q><L>When the Whale felt his side so rudely goar'd,</L>
<L>Loud as the Sea that nourisht him he roar'd.</L>
<L>As a broad Bream to please some curious taste,</L>
<L>While yet alive in boyling water cast.</L>
<L>Vext with unwonted heat, boyls, flings about</L>
<L>The Scorching brass, and hurls the liquor out;</L>
<L>So with the barbed Javeling stung, he raves,</L>
<L>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>courges with his tail the suffering waves.</L>
<L>His fury doth the Seas with Billows fill,</L>
<L>And makes a Tempest, though the winds be still,</L>
<L>He Swims in bloud, and bloud do's spouting throw</L>
<L>To Heav'n, that Heav'n mens Cruelties might know,</L>
<L>Roaring, he tears the Air with such a noise,</L>
<L>As well resembles the conspiring voice,</L>
<L>Of routed Armies when the Field is won, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></L></Q>
<P>Being dead, they tow him to the Ship with two or three Shallops joined together, and then floating at the stern of the Ship, they cut the blubber or fat from the flesh in pieces three or four foot long, which are cut smaller ashore, and boiled in Coppers, which done,
<PB N="38" REF="23"/>
they take them out, and put them into wicker Baskets, which are set in Shallops half full of water, into which the Oil runneth, and is thence put into Buts. The ordi∣nary length of a Whale is sixty Foot, his brains are said to be the <HI>Sperma Caeti,</HI> his head is the third part of him, his mouth sixteen foot wide, the Whalebones or Finns are no other than the rough and inward part of the mouth, of which he hath five hundred, which close in the shutting thereof, like the fingers of both hands within each other; he hath a Trunk or breathing hole in his head; he hath no teeth but sucks his meat; his Tongue is monstrous great and deformed like a Wool∣sack, about eight Tun in Weight, part of which yeild∣eth eleven Hogsheads of Oyl; His food, (that nature might teach the greatest to be content with little, and that greatness may be maintained without rapine, as in the Elephant and Whale, the greatest of Land and Sea Monsters) is grass and weeds of the Sea, and a kind of water-worm like a Beetle, whereof the Finns in his mouth hang full, and sometimes little birds, all which striking the Water with his Tail, and making a small Tide, he gapes and receives into his Mouth, neither is any thing else found in his Belly, as is affirmed by Eye-witnesses; this great Head hath little Eyes, not much unlike an Ox, and a little Throat not greater than for a Mans Fist to enter; with such huge Bones on each side, as suffer it not to stretch wider; his body is round, fourteen or fixteen Foot thick, his Genitals hang from him as in Beasts, in Generation they go in∣to shallow Waters near the Shore, and in the Act join Bellies, (as is said of the Elephant) at which time much of their Sperm Floats on the Water, their Tail is like a Swallows, at least twenty Foot broad at the end, they have but one young one at a time, which is brought forth as in Beasts, about the bigness, but lon∣ger than an Hogshead; the Female Whale hath two Breasts, and Teats no bigger than a Mans Head, where∣with she Suckleth her young, of which she is very ten∣der; one being killed, they could not get the young
<PB N="39" REF="23"/>
one from the Dam; there hath been made twenty se∣ven Tun of Oil out of one Whale.</P>
<P N="7">VII. But to return from this diversion; Captain <HI>Henry Hudson</HI> in 1607. discovered farther North to∣ward the Pole than perhaps any before him; he found himself in 80 Degrees, where they felt it hot, and drank Water to cool their Thirst, they judg'd they saw Land to 82 Degrees and farther; on the Shore they found Snow, Morses Teeth, Deers Horns, Bones, and Whalebones, and the footing of other Beasts; with a stream of fresh Water; the next year 1608. he set forth on a Discovery to the North-east, at which time, as several of the Company solemnly affirmed, they saw a Mermaid in the Sea; he made another Voyage in 1609. and Coasted <HI>New-found land,</HI> and thence along to <HI>Cape Cod;</HI> his last and fatal Voyage was in 1610. being imployed by several Merchants, to try if through any of those Inlets which Captain <HI>Da∣vis</HI> saw but durst not enter, there might be a passage found to the South Sea; Their Ship was called the <HI>Discovery,</HI> they passed by <HI>Iseland,</HI> and saw Mount <HI>Hecla</HI> cast out Fire, a certain Presage of foul Weather; they gave the name of <HI>Lousy Bay</HI> to one Harbour in <HI>Iseland,</HI> and found a Bath there hot enough to scald a Fowl. <HI>June</HI> 4. They saw <HI>Greenland,</HI> and after that <HI>Desolation Isle,</HI> and then plied North-west among the Islands of Ice; they ran, plaid, and filled sweet Water out of the Ponds that were upon them, some of them were a-ground in six or seven score Fathom Water, and on divers they saw Bears and Patridges; they gave names to certain Islands, as <HI>Gods Mercy,</HI> Prince <HI>Henrys Fore∣land,</HI> King <HI>James Cape,</HI> Queen <HI>Anns Cape.</HI> One Morn∣ing in a Fog they were carryed by a strong Tide into one of those Inlets, the depth whereof, and the ply∣ing forward of the Ice, gave <HI>Hudson</HI> great hope it would prove a thorough-fair.</P>
<P>After they had Sailed herein near 300 Leagues West, he came to a small Streight of two Leagues over, and very deep Water, through which he passed between
<PB N="40" REF="24"/>
the two Capes, one of which he called <HI>Digges Island</HI> in 62 Degrees, into a spacious Sea, wherein he sailed a∣bove an hundred Leagues South, being now over-con∣fident that he had found the Passage, but perceiving by the Shoal Water, that it was only a Bay, he was much surprized, committing many errors, especially in resolving to Winter in that desolate place, in such want of necessary Provisions. <HI>November</HI> 3. He moored his Ship in a small Cove, where they had all undoubt∣edly perished, but that it pleased God to send them several kinds of Fowl; they killed of white Patridges above an hundred and twenty Dozen, these left them in the Spring, and others succeeded as Swans, Geese, Teal, Ducks, all easy to take, besides the blessing of a Tree, which in <HI>December</HI> blossomed with green &amp; yellow Leaves, of a smell like Spice, which being boiled yielded an Oily substance, that proved an excellent Salve, and the Decoction being drunk, an wholesom Potion for curing the Scurvy, Sciatica, Cramps, Convulsions, and other Diseases bred by the coldness of the Climate.</P>
<P>At the opening of the year there came to the side of his Ship such a multitude of fish of all sorts, that they might easily have fraught themselves for their return, if <HI>Hudson</HI> had not too desperately pursued his Voyage, neglecting this opportunity of storing themselves, which he committed to the care of certain careless dissolute Villains, who in his absence conspired against him; in few days all the fish forsook them; one time a Savage visited them who for a Knife, Glass, and Beads, gave them Bever and Deers Skin, with a Sled: At <HI>Hudsons</HI> return they set Sail for <HI>England,</HI> but in few dayes their Victuals being almost spent and he in despair, letting fall some words of setting some on shore, the Conspirators entred his Cabin in the night, and for∣ced <HI>Hudson,</HI> his Son and six more, to go out of the ship into the Shallop and seek their Fortune, after which they were never heard of, but certainly perished in the Sea. In a few days the Victuals in the Ship being spent, they took 2 or 300 tame Fowls, and traded with the
<PB N="41" REF="24"/>
Savages for Deer skins, Morse teeth and Furrs. One of their men went a shore, and found they lived in Tents, Men, Women, and Children, together; they were big-boned, broad faced, flat noosed and small feet like the <HI>Tartars,</HI> their Garments, Gloves, and Shoes were of Skins handsomly wrought; next morning <HI>Green,</HI> one of the principal Conspirators would needs go on shore, with divers others unarmed, the Savages lay in ambush, and at the first onset shot this mutinous Ringleader to the heart, and another as bad who dyed swearing and cursing, the rest of these Traytors dyed a few days after of their wounds, Divine Justice finding executioners by these barbarous people. The Ship escaped narrowly, for one <HI>Abraham Prichard</HI> (a servant to Sir <HI>Dudley Diggs,</HI> whom the Mutineers had saved in hope he would pro∣cure their pardon from his Master) was left to keep the Vessel where he sate at the Stern in his Gown sick and lame, when the Leader of the Savages suddenly leapt from a Rock, and with a strange kind of weapon of Steel wounded him desperately before he could draw out a small <HI>Stotch</HI> Dagger from under his Gown, wherewith at one thrust into the side of the Savage he killed him, and brought off the Ship, and some of the wounded company Swimming to him, they hastned homeward without ever striking Sail, being so distrest for food, that they were forced to fry the weeds of the Sea with Candles ends to sustain their lives, <HI>Sept.</HI> 6. 1611. they met with a Fisherman of <HI>Foy</HI> in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> by whose means they came safe to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. But above all, Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> whose me∣mory is most deservedly honoured of all men, ought to be recorded for his extraordinary Abilities, Experi∣ence and happy Conduct at S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a. This brave Seaman in the beginning of his Actions was Captain of the <HI>Ju∣dith</HI> with Sir <HI>John Hawkins,</HI> in the Voyage to <HI>Guiana</HI> 1567. where they received some considerable damage from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the Port of St. <HI>John de Ʋllua,</HI> con∣trary to their promise and agreement; and therefore
<PB N="42" REF="25"/>
to repair himself, having first been assured by Divines, that his Cause was just, in 1572. be set out for <HI>America</HI> with two Ships and a Pinnace, one called the <HI>Dragon,</HI> wherein he himself was, and at his first attempt sur∣prized <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> at that time one of the richest Towns in <HI>America;</HI> but in the Action, happening to re∣ceive a wound in one of his Feet, which disabled him, he was not able to command, nor gather that rich Spoil that lay even in sight before him; for his Company being too much discouraged with thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> disaster, carried him back to the Ships, even almost whether he would or no, leaving the Town, and an infinite Mass of Trea∣sure behind them untouched, (to the great joy of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>) a great part whereof they saw in the Go∣vernours House with their own Eyes, namely, huge Bars of Silver lying round about the Hall, piled up a great height from the ground, ready to be transported to <HI>Spain;</HI> yet his Men forced him to put to Sea, so that this Voyage served only to whet his stomach to give them a second Visit with all speed.</P>
<P>Being somewhat recovered of his wounds, he falls with his Ships into the Sound of <HI>Darien,</HI> where he found a certain People called <HI>Symerons,</HI> which are for the most part <HI>Negro's,</HI> and such as having been Slaves to the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI> by reason of their cruelty and hard usage run away from them, and live in woods and wild places of the Countrey in great companies together like other Savages, hating the <HI>Spaniards</HI> deadly, and doing them what mischief they can upon all occasions; By these he got Intelligence that a <HI>Requa,</HI> as they call it, or a cer∣tain number of Mules, commonly 40 or 50 in a com∣pany laden with Treasure and other things was to pass in few daies from <HI>Panama</HI> in the South Sea to <HI>Nombre de Dios</HI> to be shipped from thence for <HI>Spain,</HI> which he therefore resolved, if it were possible, to surprize. These <HI>Requa's</HI> do constantly Travel in the night, (by reason of the openness of the way, and the excessive heats in the day) from <HI>Panama</HI> to <HI>Ventacruz</HI> about six Leagues in the road to <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> neither had
<PB N="43" REF="25"/>
they then any other Guard but only of those that drive them, and perhaps some Gentleman or Officer of the Kings to oversee the Treasure, by reason of their great security, having till then lived without any fear of an enemy upon that Coast, which made the de∣sign seem easy.</P>
<P>Having therefore engaged a sufficient number of these <HI>Symerons</HI> with no more than eighteen resolved men of his own, leaving the rest with the ships, they marcht by night over the strait of <HI>Darien,</HI> so called, as being that Neck of Land that joins the Northern and Southern part of <HI>America</HI> together, and is not above 20 mile over from Sea to Sea, though many Leagues long; They travelled undiscovered within a Leagues of <HI>Pa∣nama,</HI> and lodged themselves in a wood on each side the Road where the Mules were to pass, who at length came, so tyed one to another, as the manner is, that by stopping one, all the rest stand still. The <HI>Requa</HI> which was coming, belonged chiefly to the Treasurer of <HI>Lima,</HI> who with his daughter and Family were going for <HI>Spain,</HI> with 8 Mules laden with Gold, and one with Jewels, which doubtless had been all taken, had not one <HI>Robert Pike</HI> an <HI>Englishman</HI> prevented it, who being got drunk with Strong-waters, out of a vain ambition to be first in the action, stood up, and wearing his shirt uppermost, as they did all to distinguish each other in the night, was instantly descried by a <HI>Spanish</HI> Cava∣leer, who rid somewhat before the rest, and turning his Horse, gave such speedy notice, that the chief part of the Treasure, with the Treasurer himself, his Daugh∣ter and others, were saved by a timely retreat, and on∣ly some few of the foremost Mules taken, which though they had some Treasure, yet the <HI>English</HI> knowing how soon the Countrey would be alarm'd, durst, scarce stay to ransack them, but taking a little of what came next to hand resolutely made their way through <HI>Venta Cruz,</HI> and so by woods and wild Forrests of the Countrey to the Ships which expected them in the Sound, yet had the good fortune to meet with a smaller <HI>Requa</HI> of
<PB N="44" REF="26"/>
Mules laden with Silver and some Gold, which havin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> better leisure to examine, they carried away as muc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as they were able to the Ships, burying the rest in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ground.</P>
<P>In 1577. Sr. <HI>Francis Drake</HI> made his Voyage abou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the World, in which to his immortal Fame and Honou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he was the first Commander of note that incompasse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Globe of the Earth, and returned safe home again▪ For though <HI>Ferdinand Magellan</HI> had discovered th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Streights which yet bear his name, and had gone far yet he lived not to return home, being slain at the <HI>Mo¦luccae</HI> Islands, while he was reducing them to the obe¦dience of his new Master the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> This Voy¦age made <HI>Drake</HI> some amends from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> tak¦ing and rifling many Towns, and divers rich prizes a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sea, as at <HI>Valparaiso</HI> in the South Sea, where he took a Ship loaden with Wines, and as much of the finest Gold of <HI>Baldivia</HI> accounted the best as amounted to thirty seven Duckets of <HI>Spanish</HI> Money, besides Silver and o∣ther goods of value. At <HI>Tarapaca</HI> on the same Coasts, he met with thirteen bars of pure Silver valued at four Thousand Duckets, and after that with eight hundred Pound weight of Silver laden to <HI>Panama</HI> upon certain Sheep of <HI>America,</HI> as big as Asses, which they use for Burden. At <HI>Arica</HI> they rifled certain Barks and other small Vessels which they found in the Port, and took out of them, besides other Merchandise, fifty seven wedges of pure Silver, every one twenty pound weight, and amounting in all to one hundred and forty pound weight of Silver.</P>
<P>At <HI>Lima</HI> they enter the Haven, where they found twelve Ships moored fast at Anchor, their Sails taken off, and all the Mariners secure on shore, whereupon searching the Ships, they found, besides abundance of Silks, Linnen, and other rich Goods, one chest full of Ryols of Plate, which they did not think convenient to leave behind, and, which pleased them more, had there Intelligence of another Great <HI>Spanish</HI> Ship called the <HI>Cacafuego</HI> which was at <HI>Payta,</HI> laden with nothing
<PB N="45" REF="26"/>
but treasure; this Ship had perceived them at Sea, and was making all the Sail she could for <HI>Pariama,</HI> but be∣fore she could recovor the Port, they persuing her very hard got sight of her about Cape <HI>Francisco,</HI> and after some short dispute board her, and make her yield. In this Ship they found thirteen great Chests full of Ry∣als of Plate, twenty six Tun of other Silver, fourscore pound weight of pure Gold, besides abundance of Je∣wels, precious Stones, and other rich Merchandize, all which became prize, meeting likewise in the persuit of her a single Bark laden above only with ropes &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ackle for ships, but examining her within, they found no less than seventy eight pound weight of fine Gold, besides many curious Emeralds, and other choice Jewels, which having taken they sailed for <HI>Acapulco,</HI> a noted and much frequented Port in those Seas, in their way they met a Ship from <HI>China</HI> laden with Silks and <HI>China</HI>-dishes, of which they took as much as they thought good, and af∣ter that rifled the Town of <HI>Acapulco,</HI> where besides some quantity of Gold, Jewels, and other Plate, they found one pot of the bigness of an <HI>English</HI> bushel full of <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> Ryals, which having emptied, they departed with∣out being farther troublesom, only one <HI>Moon</HI> an <HI>English∣man</HI> borrowed a Chain of Gold, which he hapned to find about a <HI>Spaniard</HI> just as they were going out of Town.</P>
<P>Finding themselves reasonably loaden, and that their Ships had endured the Sea a long time, they resolve to return for <HI>England</HI> by the <HI>Moluccae</HI> and <HI>Philippine</HI> Islands, Sailing in this South Sea to forty degrees of Northerly Latitude, where he landed, and named it <HI>Nova Albion.</HI> The Inhabitants presented him Feathers and Kalls of Network, which he requited with other things, the men went naked, the Women had loose Garments of Bulrushes tyed about their middles; They came a se∣cond time and brought Feathers, and bags of Tobacco, and after a long oration by one that was Speaker for the rest, they left their bows on an Hill, and came down to our men, the women in the mean time remaining on the Hill, tormented themselves tearing their flesh from
<PB N="46" REF="27"/>
their cheeks, whereby it appeared they were about some sacrifice, the news being further spread, brought the King thither, who was a very proper man, and had the like to attend him, two Ambassadours, with a Speech of half an hour long, gave an account of his in∣tended coming; when he appeared, one went before him with a Scepter or Mace, whereon there hung two Crowns with 3 Chains, the Crowns were of knitwork wrought artificially with feathers of divers colours, the chains made of bone. The King was clothed in Cony∣skins, his Followers had their faces painted with white, black, and other colours, every one even the Children bringing their Presents. He that carried the Scepter made a loud Speech of half an hour, repeating it from another, who whispered to him, which being ended with a Solemn applause, they all came orderly down the Hill without their weapons, the Scepter-bearer be∣ginning a Song and dance and all the rest following him. The King and several others made many Orati∣ons or Supplications to <HI>Drake</HI> that he would be their King, and the King with a Song set the Crown on his head, and put the Chains about his neck, honouring him by the name of <HI>Hioh.</HI> The Common sort leaving the King and his Guard, mingled themselves among the <HI>English,</HI> viewing them severely, and offering thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sacrifices to those they best liked, which were com∣monly the youngest, weeping,, and rending their flesh with much effusion of bloud. Our men misliked their Devotions, and directed them to worship the Living God: Every third day they brought their Sacrifice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> till they found them displeasing, yet at the depar∣ture of the <HI>English</HI> they very much grieved, and secretly provided a Sacrifice; They found Herds of Deer feeding by thousands and strange Conies, with heads like ours, feet like a Mole and the tail of a Cat, having under their chains a bag lnto which they put their meat when their Bellies are full. Sailing from hence they went back by the <HI>Cape of Good Hope;</HI> And <HI>Nov.</HI> 3. 1580. which was the third year of their Voyage they safely arrived at <HI>Plymouth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="27"/>In 1585. This Gallant Seaman, having been Knight∣ed, and much Honoured by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> made a∣nother Voyage to <HI>America,</HI> with a greater number of Ships, in which, besides other places of note, he took and burnt a good part of St. <HI>Domingo</HI> in <HI>Hispa∣niola,</HI> forcing the Inhabitants to redeem the other part with twenty five Thousand Duckets in Money, he took also <HI>Car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hagena</HI> a Town upon the Continent, and in it <HI>Alonso Bravo</HI> the Governour, and after burn∣ing some Houses, had eleven Thousand Duckets paid him by the Inhabitants to spare the rest; he took like∣wise the Towns of St. <HI>Anth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny</HI> and St. <HI>Helena;</HI> but at last the <HI>English</HI> in the Ships falling Sick of the Calen∣ture, and many dying, he was forced to return for <HI>England,</HI> with what he had already got, which was va∣lued at threescore Thousand Pound Sterling of cleer Prize, besides two hundred Pieces of Brass Ordnance and Forty of Iron.</P>
<P>In 1595. Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> made his last Voyage, which proved not altogether so successful to him as the former, by reason, as was thought, of some misunder∣standing between him and Sir <HI>John Hawkins,</HI> who was the other General joined in Commission with him for the Expedition; they both died in this Voyage, Sir <HI>John Hawkins</HI> first, as soon as ever the Ship came in sight of <HI>Porto Rico;</HI> after which <HI>Drake</HI> being Sole Ge∣neral, made an attempt upon that place, but could only Fire some Ships in the Haven, receiving some loss himself; yet he proceeded and took <HI>Rio de la Ha∣cha, Raucheria,</HI> at that time a Wealthy Town, by the Trade of Pearl Fishing, and lastly <HI>Nombre de dios,</HI> but found nothing so much Treasure now, as he saw the first time, from hence marching by Land he design∣ed to surprize <HI>Panama,</HI> but Sir <HI>Thomas Baskervile,</HI> who commanded a party of seven hundred and fifty Soul∣diers for that purpose, found the Passages over the Mountains so difficult, and the passes so well guarded, that he was forced to retreat, not without loss of Men, whom the <HI>Spaniards</HI> being acquainted with the
<PB N="48" REF="28"/>
Countrey, and lying in the woods through which they were to pass, killed in their return: Hereupon they were forced to put to Sea again, and not long after <HI>Sir Francis Drake</HI> himself fell sick, and partly of a Flux and grief for his ill success, having hitherto been acquainted with nothing but good Fortune and Victory, he died within few days before <HI>Porto bello,</HI> and the Fleet under Sir <HI>Tho. Baskervile</HI> return'd to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P N="9">IX. Another renowned worthy among the English Adventurers of <HI>America,</HI> and especially for a prospe∣rous and compleat circumnavigation of the Ocean, was Sir <HI>Thomas Cavendish</HI> of <HI>Trimley</HI> in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> who in July 1586 with three Ships and 120 Men set out from <HI>Plymouth</HI> for the <HI>West Indies,</HI> and <HI>Aug.</HI> 25 following fell with the Point of <HI>Sierra Liona</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Gui∣ny,</HI> and from thence <HI>Sept:</HI> 7 with the Isle of <HI>Madra∣bamba</HI> about <HI>Cape Verde,</HI> a place very convenient for taking in fresh water and other necessaries for men at Sea, but otherwise much subject to sudden claps of Thunder, Lightning and storms, especially in winter. Their design was for the Streights of <HI>Magellan,</HI> and the South sea, therefore steering directly South, by the latter end of <HI>October</HI> they dicover Cape <HI>Frio</HI> on the Coasts of <HI>Brasil,</HI> and put in at an Harbour between the Isle of St <HI>Sebastian</HI> and the Continent, where they stayed some time building a New Pinnace, and sup∣plying their Ships with necessaries; Then sailing toward the <HI>Streights Jan.</HI> 6. they came to an Anchor at the Streights mouth not far from the place where the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> intended a Town and Fort for commanding the Streights, and securing the Passage into the South-Sea against all Nations but themselves. But as it appeared that project took no effect, for of 400 Men left there three Years before by <HI>Don Pedro Sarmiento</HI> to that purpose by order of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> there were scarce 20 remaining alive when Sir <HI>Tho: Cav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣dish</HI> sailed that way, the rest were either starved for want of necessary Provisions, or destroyed by the Na∣tives. They had begun their Town which they named
<PB N="49" REF="28"/>
St. <HI>Philip</HI> upon the narrowest Passage of the Streights about half a mile broad, in a place very convenient for their purpose, and the Town it self well contrived with four several Forts, every one having some Guns which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> when they saw themselves left de∣stitute and not able to subsist any longer there, had buried in the ground, but the Carriages of them stand∣ing open and in view, upon search the Peices them∣selves were found and now taken by the <HI>English.</HI> Ma∣ny <HI>Spaniards</HI> who had been left there were found dead in their houses, and lying in their Cloaths unburied. Those few who were alive, which were only twenty three, whereof two Women, though they were scarce able to go or help themselves, yet were re∣solved, as they said, to travel by Land toward <HI>Rio De La Plata,</HI> distant some hundreds of Leagues from the place where they were, which they had free leave to do.</P>
<P><HI>Cavendish</HI> made no long stay here, but calling the place <HI>Port Famin</HI> instead of St. <HI>Philip,</HI> they held their course along the Streights till <HI>Feb.</HI> 24. they entred the South Sea, finding the whole length of the Streights to be about ninety Leagues in length in 52 degrees of South Latitude, having good and convenient Har∣bours on both sides almost at every Leagues end, but otherwise of most difficult passage by reason of the ma∣ny windings and turnings of the Sea, and of so many contrary winds, with which from several Coasts this Passage is almost continually infested, but especially in the depth of winter at which time by the intolerable sharpnes of the cold, frequent storms, and huge flights of Snow, there is neither Sailing nor abiding upon those Seas, neither is the return so safe as the going thither.</P>
<P>Being now got into <HI>Mare Del Zur,</HI> and as it were upon the backside of <HI>America,</HI> they ply up and down those Coasts, visiting and not seldom pillaging the Towns, taking such Ships as they met withall, and steering their course so far Northwest, till at last
<PB N="50" REF="29"/>
<HI>June</HI> 12. 1587. they cross the Equinoctial Line, sailing Northward up toward <HI>Panama</HI> and <HI>New Spain,</HI> but whether Intelligence had been given to those parts of their being upon the Coasts, it was some time before they could Spy any Ships. The first was <HI>July</HI> 9 when they took a New Ship of 120 Tuns burthen coming from <HI>Puna</HI> laden with ropes and other tackle, and in her one <HI>Michael Sancius</HI> a Provincial born at <HI>Marseilles,</HI> who to do the <HI>Spaniards</HI> a pleasure gave them informa∣tion of a great Ship called the St. <HI>Anna</HI> expected from the <HI>Philippine</HI> Islands, and which upon his Information they took within a few days after, being one of the richest Prizes that ever was taken and carried off those Seas by <HI>Englishmen,</HI> but first they Sail to <HI>Acapulco</HI> and having rifled the Town, they took a Bark in the Ha∣ven of fifty Tuns Burthen, laden with 600 bags of Anile, which is a rich sort of Dye, every bag being esti∣mated at forty Crowns, and 400 bags of <HI>Cacao</HI> an <HI>Ame∣rican</HI> fruit like Almonds, and so much valued that they pass there for Meat and Money, every bag being worth Ten Crowns the whole prize in the Bark (beside what they got in the Town) amounted to twenty eight thou∣sand Crowns.</P>
<P>From hence they Sail Northward to the Bay of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and being come as far as the Tropique of <HI>Capri∣corn,</HI> they were in some distress for want of Water, thinking they had none nearer than thirty or forty Leagues, but by the advice of the aforenamed <HI>Michael</HI> the <HI>Frenchman,</HI> who was a man of long and great expe∣rience upon those Coasts, they digged about 5 foot deep on the adjoyning shore, and found very good fresh Wa∣ter in a soil outwardly dry and Sandy, which he told them was an usual experiment in many other places upon those Coasts. About <HI>October</HI> they came to St. <HI>Lu∣car</HI> on the West side of the point of <HI>Califormia,</HI> where they resolved to wait the coming of the St. <HI>Anna</HI> a∣bovementioned, which about <HI>Nov.</HI> 4. appeared to their no small content. She was a Ship of Seven Hundred Tuns and Admiral of the Seas, and therefore not only
<PB N="51" REF="29"/>
richly loaden but well mann'd, by noon the <HI>English</HI> Ships got up with her, and gave her a broadside which she answered, but soon after put her self to a close fight, and expected boarding, which the <HI>Engli h</HI> attempting were twice beaten off, and forced to betake themselves again to their Guns, with which they so be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aked her from side to side, and plyed it so continually, that after a dispute of 5 or 6 hours, she was made to yield, the Captain hanging out a flag of Truce, and begging mer∣cy for their Lives, which the General readily granted, and thereupon commanding him to strike Sail and come on board, the Captain, Pilot, and some of the principal Merchants did so, they were in all 190 Per∣sons in the Ship, Men and Women, and declared that their Lading was one hundred twenty two Thousand <HI>Pezo's</HI> of fine Gold, abundance of Silks, Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tins, Damask, Musk, Conserve of Fruits, Drugs, and other the richest Merchandize of <HI>India,</HI> of which they could give no certain estimate, now every <HI>Pezo</HI> in Silver is valu∣ed at eight shillings, and consequently in proportion a <HI>Pezo</HI> in Gold must be worth four pound sixteen Shil∣lings, so that the whole value of the Prize would not be less than Ten Hundred Thousand Pound, or a Mil∣lion of Sterling Money, enough to make them all Gen∣tlemen that shared in it. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> and other Peo∣ple of the Ship were according to their desire set a shore at the next Port, with necessary Provisions given them, both for subsistence and their defence in Tra∣vel.</P>
<P>From hence they sailed to the <HI>Philippine Islands,</HI> and in 45 days reached the Islands <HI>Ladrones,</HI> so called, which lye in the way thither about 17 or 18 hundred Leagues from <HI>Califormia</HI> whence they came, very convenient for fresh Water but the people wholly barbarous and Savage, and so extreamly given to pilfering and Steal∣ing, that from thence <HI>Magell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne</HI> gave them the name of <HI>Ladrones,</HI> or the <HI>Island of Thieves.</HI> In <HI>January</HI> they came to <HI>Mavilla</HI> the chief of the <HI>Philippine</HI> Islands, which is counted the richest Countrey for Col<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the
<PB N="52" REF="30"/>
World, but scarce of silver, the <HI>Sanguelos</HI> as they call them, who are great and rich Merchants of the Coun∣try trade continually with the <HI>Americans</HI> of <HI>New Spain</HI> for their Silver, giving weight for weight in pure Gold, from hence about the middle of <HI>March</HI> they reach the Islands of <HI>Java,</HI> where by way of barter with the Inhabitants for such things as they had got upon the Coasts of <HI>America,</HI> they plentifully stored their Ships with all kind of Flesh Meats, Fowls and Fruits, ne∣cessary for their subsistence homeward, receiving at their going away a Present of the same nature from the King of the Countrey, namely, two fat Oxen alive, ten great and fat Hoggs, abundance of Hens, Ducks, Geese and Eggs, a great quantity of Sugar Canes, Sugar in plate, Coco's, Plantans, sweet Oranges, sowre Lemons, great store of good Wines, Aquavitae, Salt, with almost all manner of Victuals besides; and it was no more than they had need of in the place where they were, for putting again to Sea, and making for the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> which is the utmost Point of <HI>Africk</HI> South∣ward; they sailed upon that vast <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, be∣fore they could reach the Cape, almost nine weeks, running a Course of at least eighteen hundred and fifty Leagues without touching Land, it being reckoned to be full 2000 Leagues from the Islands of <HI>Java</HI> to the <HI>Cape of Good Hope;</HI> There lies about forty or fifty Leagues short of the Cape, a certain Foreland called <HI>Cabo Falso,</HI> because it is usually at its first discovery at Sea mistaken by Mariners for the true Cape.</P>
<P>From hence by <HI>June</HI> 18. 1588. they fall in sight of the Island of St. <HI>Helena,</HI> which lieth in the main Ocean, and as it were in the middle way between the Coast of <HI>Africk</HI> and <HI>Brasil,</HI> in fifteen degrees, and forty eight minutes of Southern Latitude, distant from the Cape about six hundred Leagues. It is a pleasant Island, well stored with Oranges, Lemons, Pomegranats, Pome∣citrons, Dates, and so proper for Figgs, that the Trees bear all the year long; so that there are blossoms, green and ripe Figgs at all times on the same Tree. It
<PB N="53" REF="30"/>
affords also store of wild Fowl, Partridges, and Phea∣sants; a kind of Turkies black and white, and as big as ours in <HI>England;</HI> great plenty of Goats, and such abun∣dance of Swine, fat and large, that they live in Herds upon the Mountains, and are not to be taken but by hunting, and that with great pain and industry. From hence by <HI>August</HI> 24. they discover <HI>Flores,</HI> and <HI>Corvo,</HI> two of the <HI>Azores</HI> or <HI>Tercerae</HI> Islands; and <HI>Sept.</HI> 9. having first suffered a terrible Stormupon the <HI>English</HI> Coast, which carried away all their Sails, and ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣gered the loss of all they had got; yet at last by the mercy of God, and favour of a good Wind, they arri∣ved safely at <HI>Plymouth.</HI></P>
<P N="10">X. The Right Honourable <HI>George</HI> Lord <HI>Clifford</HI> Earl of <HI>Cumberland</HI> had made several Voyages and Adven∣tures against the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in and toward the parts of <HI>America,</HI> in 1586. 89, 92 and 94, with various success, but in 1597. He more publickly and avowed∣ly in his own Person undertook an expedition with eighteen or twenty good Ships, and about a Thou∣sand Men, being himself Admiral and Commander in Chief. He set out from <HI>Portsmouth, March</HI> 6. 1597. with design at first to attend the coming out of the Carracks, which go yearly from <HI>Spain</HI> to the <HI>West In∣dies;</HI> but being disappointed of them through some In∣telligence that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had gotten of his Lord∣shitps being at Sea, he Sailed on for the Coast of <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> resolving by the way, with the consent of the Principal Commanders with him, to make an attempt upon St. <HI>John de Porto Rico,</HI> the Principal Town and Port of the Island of that name, in nineteen Degrees of North Latitude, a place where a few years before Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> had received some loss, Sir <HI>Nicholas Clifford</HI> the Earls Brother being slain, by a shot from one of the Platforms, as he sat at Supper with the General in the Ship called the <HI>Defiance.</HI></P>
<P>The Town stands in a <HI>Peninsula</HI> by it self, yet close∣ly joined to the main Island toward the North, being, a place very well seated, and fortified with two
<PB N="54" REF="31"/>
strong Castles, one for defence of the Haven, the o∣ther of the Town; about three or four Leagues off lies a fair sandy Bay or Beach, which the Sea washeth on one side, over which the <HI>English</HI> at their landing marched directly to the Town through a thick Wood, and upon a Cawsey of some length, but of breadth on∣ly to admit three Persons to march abreast; at the end thereof, was built a strong Bridge of Wood, which reached from one Island to the other, and join∣ed them both together, having also some Barricado's to defend it, and a Block-house with Ordnance on the further side of the Water. They were informed that at low Water they might pass the Bridge on ei∣ther side the Cawsey; whereupon waiting till two a Clock next Morning, when the Ebb would be, they attempt the Passage, but could not gain it, because the Great Guns played so directly against the Cawsey, retreating with the loss of about Fifty Men killed and wounded. Next day the General ordered another Fort standing upon the Principal Island should be attackt by Sea, the place was of dangerous access, yet by the help of some Musketeers that were gotten upon cer∣tain Rocks within the Island, so near, that they could play upon them in the Fort, within an hour the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI> that kept it quitted the place, and those from Sea entred it in Boats, though the Ship that brought them near was her self cast away upon the Rocks at the first ebbing of the Water, as it was at first feared she would.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who quitted the Fort, with the chief of the Town who were not already fled, retired to another Fort called <HI>Mora</HI> giving the <HI>English</HI> leave to enter the Town, and block up the Fort wherein they were, so that in few days they surrendred upon discretion, and the <HI>English</HI> were Masters of all. The General designed to have kept it but the <HI>English</HI> by the intemperature of the Air, and their own intemperance, especially in eating many strange and luscious Fruits, contracted such sickness, so many dying of the Calen∣ture,
<PB N="55" REF="31"/>
bloody Flux, and other hot diseases, that after ten weeks possession, and 600 of his men dead, his Lord∣ship was forced to return for <HI>England,</HI> doing no further hurt to the Town, save only bringing away 80 pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s of Ordnance, the Bells of their Church, and some quantity of Sugar and Ginger, sustaining no other loss in the Voyage, than of sixty men slain upon taking the Town, the six hundred dying of the Flux and other diseases, the Ship <HI>Pegasus</HI> wrackt upon <HI>Goodwin</HI> Sands, an old Frigot lost upon <HI>Ʋ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hant</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Normandy</HI> with 40 men in them, add a Bark lost by Tempest about <HI>Bermudas.</HI></P>
<P>The Admiral at his return left Sir <HI>John Barclay</HI> be∣hind, with some Men and Ships to compound with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> for the Town, but they seeing the Gene∣ral gone, and the <HI>English</HI> by reason of sickness not like to continue long after him, made no great hast to compound, but delayed so long that at last the <HI>English</HI> were forced to leave it to them, without burn∣ing or doing them any other mischief, as the Admiral had left Order, who sought Honour more than Spoil by this expedition as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> happily experien∣ced.</P>
<P N="11">XI. Captain <HI>John Oxenham</HI> who had formerly been Servant, Souldier and Mariner with Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> and together with him had sustained some loss by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the Port of Sir <HI>John De Ʋllua,</HI> was resolved to recover that by force which he complained was by force taken from him, and having by his former Ad∣ventures gained competent skill in Maritime Affairs, being particularly acquainted with the Coast and Com∣modities of the <HI>West Indies,</HI> in 1575 he got to be Cap∣tain of a Ship of an hundred and forty Tuns burden carrying seventy men, with whom he sailed for <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> &amp; arriv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d at the Sound of <HI>Darien</HI> where Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> formerly fell acquainted with the <HI>Symerons</HI> who put him upon surprizing the Treasure at <HI>Panama,</HI> a Place and People which Captain <HI>Oxenham</HI> very well knew, and intended now to make use of; Nor was it
<PB N="56" REF="32"/>
long ere he met with some of them, who inform him that the Mules now travel with a strong Guard of Soul∣diers, which was somewhat contrary to his expecta∣tion, and quite altered his design; However being resolved to act some great thing, it did not much dis∣animate him, and therefore finding little hopes of suc∣cess here, they resolve to try their Fortunes on the South Sea. To this purpose the Captain brings his own Ship on ground, and covers her with boughs and rubbish as well as he could, and burying his great Guns in the Earth he with his Company and 6 Ne∣gro's to conduct them march by land toward the Coast of <HI>Panama</HI> and <HI>Peru.</HI></P>
<P>Having gone about 14 Leagues, they came to a River which the <HI>Symerons</HI> told them ran directly into the South Sea; Here they cut down wood, and built themselves a Pinnace about 45 foot long, wherein they put to Sea, making toward the <HI>Island of Pearls</HI> 25 Leagues South of <HI>Panama</HI> hoping some Ships from <HI>Peru</HI> or other places from the South would be sailing that way for <HI>Panama.</HI> So that though Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> hath deservedly the honour of first discovering the South Sea to the <HI>English</HI> by the open and known way of the Streights, yet Captain <HI>Oxenham</HI> was the first <HI>Englishman</HI> that ever sailed upon it with command. He had not waited long but there came a Bark from <HI>Quito</HI> a Province of <HI>Peru</HI> laden with Goods, and sixty Thousand <HI>Pezo's</HI> of fine Gold, which he took, and within six days after, another from <HI>Lima,</HI> wherein were no less than two hundred Thousand <HI>Pezo's</HI> of Sil∣ver in Bars, the value of a <HI>Pezo,</HI> both in Gold and Sil∣ver, you have in Sir <HI>Tho. Cavendishes</HI> Voyage; accord∣ing to which account, this Prize amounted to nine hundred and sixty Thousand Pound S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erling in Gold, and fourscore Thousand Pound in Silver, which being enough to satisfy reasonable Men, they retire with their Pinn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce up the River, intending to make all speed to their Ship, but unhappily by the Covetous∣ness and Dissention of some of the Company, so much
<PB N="57" REF="32"/>
time was spent about sharing their Booty, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> at <HI>Panama</HI> had notice of it, whereupon Ships were presently dispatcht to pursue them at Sea, and Souldiers to intercept them at Land.</P>
<P>The Captain himself through the obstinacy and wil∣fulness of some of the Company, was forced to leave the Treasure with them, and Travel some Leagues up into the Country, to find <HI>Negro's</HI> that might help him to carry it, his own Men refusing to do it, but quar∣relling with him for larger pay. In the mean time the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships came to the mouth of the River, and by the Feathers of certain Hens which the <HI>English</HI> had ta∣ken and pluckt there, they judged them to be gone up the River, and putting in after them soon over∣took them, and their Prize together. The Captain was absent, but either the <HI>Negro's</HI> or some of the <HI>En∣glish</HI> having discovered that their Ship lay in the Sound, neither he nor any of the rest escaped, but were all in a short time met with by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and having no Commission to shew, he going only upon his own Ac∣count, every Man of them were Executed save two Boys. Thus ended the stout and resolute Captain <HI>Ox∣enham,</HI> the Justice of whose Cause (saith my Author) I will not dispute with his Adversaries, but could wish it had been as perfectly just in all respects, as it was gallant and bravely managed on the Captains part, in∣somuch that his very Enemies who put him to death, do yet admire and extol it, miscarrying only through Passion, Covetousness, and Self-will of some of his Company, whose Lives paid for their folly.</P>
<P N="12">XII. That Valiant and Learned Knight, Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh,</HI> having Intelligence of the Rich and Mighty Empire of <HI>Guiana</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> which is bounded on the North with <HI>Orenoque</HI> River and the Sea, on the East and South, with the River of <HI>Amazones,</HI> and on the West with the Mountains of <HI>Peru;</HI> In <HI>March</HI> 1595. he set forth for discovery thereof, and landed at <HI>Curi∣apan</HI> in <HI>Trinidado,</HI> taking the City of St. <HI>Joseph,</HI> and therein <HI>Antony Berreo</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> Governour; leaving
<PB N="58" REF="33"/>
his Ships, he went with an hundred Men in Boats, and a little Galley with <HI>Indian</HI> Pilots, into the famous River of <HI>Orenoque,</HI> which runs from <HI>Quito</HI> in <HI>Peru</HI> on the West, and hath nine Branches on the North side, and seven on the South, the Inhabitants on the Nor∣thern Branches are the <HI>Tivitivas</HI> a Valiant Nation, and of the most manly and deliberate Speech that I have heard, saith Sir <HI>Walter.</HI> In Summer they Build Houses on the Ground, in Winter upon Trees, where they Build very Artificial Towns and Villages, for be∣tween <HI>May</HI> and <HI>September,</HI> the River rises thirty Foot upright, and then are these Islands, which the River makes, overflown twenty five Foot high, except in some raised Grounds; the Natives never eat any thing that is set or sown, using the tops of Palmettos for Bread, and killing Deer, Fish, and Pork for Meat; those that dwell on some other Branches are chiefly imployed in making Canoos, which they sell into <HI>Gui∣ana</HI> for Gold, and to <HI>Trinidado</HI> for Tobacco, in taking of which they exceed all Nations; when their King dies, they use great lamentation, and when they think the flesh is putrified and fallen from the Bones, they take up the Carcass again, and hang it up in his House, decking his Skull with Feathers of all Colours, and hanging Plates of Gold about his Arms, Thighs and Legs; those who dwell on the South beat the Bones of their King to Powder, which their Wives and Friends Drink.</P>
<P>As they passed along these Streams, they were en∣tertained with several curious Divertisements, the Deer feeding by the Water-side, the Birds of variety of co∣lours and notes singing, the Fields embroidered with Plants and Flowers, the Fishes and Fowls of all kinds playing in the River, only the Crocodile, who preys both on the Land and Water, had almost spoiled the Comedy, by turning it into a Tragedy, feasting him∣self with a <HI>Negro</HI> of their company before their Eyes. Passing hence to <HI>Cumana</HI> 120 Leagues North, they came to a People as black as <HI>Negro's,</HI> but with smooth
<PB N="59" REF="33"/>
Hair, whose Arrows are so mortally poisoned, that they kill with unspeakable Torments, especially if men drink after they are wounded. At the Port of <HI>More∣quito</HI> they anchored, and the King, who was an hun∣dred and ten years old, came fourteen miles on foot to see them, returning the same day; they brought them Fruits great store, a sort of Pariquetro's no big∣ger than Wrens; An <HI>Armadilla</HI> which seemed covered all over with small Plates, somewhat like a Rhinoceros, with a white Horn growing in his hinder parts, which they use to wind instead of a Trumpet, and the Snout of a Pig; this Beast they afterward eat.</P>
<P>They passed forward till they came in sight of those strange Cataracts or Over-falls of <HI>Caroli,</HI> of which there appeared ten or twelve in sight, every one as high above the other as a Church Steeple. They likewise saw a Mountain of Chrystal, which appeared afar off like a white Tower, exceeding high, over which there falls a mighty River, which touches no part of the side of the Mountain, but rusheth over, leaving all hollow underneath, with such a dreadful noise, as if a thousand great Bells were rung together. Further South they were told is the Nation of the <HI>Amazons,</HI> where none but Women inhabit, conversing with the Men only once a year, but none of these were seen by our Men; nor any of those People whose Mouths are said to be in their Breasts, and their Eyes in their Shoulders; and others who have Heads like Dogs, and live all the day in the Sea, which Relations we may justly esteem fabulous, till we are certified of their reality by some honest Eye-witness; yet one <HI>Fran∣cis Parrey</HI> left there by Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh,</HI> tells of a place called <HI>Camala,</HI> where at certain times Women are sold as at a Fair, and says he bought eight young Girls, the Eldest of which was not eighteen▪ for a Red hasted Knife, which in <HI>England</HI> cost an half-pen∣ny, he bestowed these Lasses upon the Savages, and was himself afterward sent Prisoner to <HI>Spain.</HI> After fourteen years Imprisonment in the Tower of <HI>London,</HI>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> A Prospect of <HI>New found-land,</HI> with the Discovery, Plantation, and Pro∣duct thereof.</HEAD>
<P>HItherto I have treated only of some Voyages and Discoveries made by divers worthy <HI>Englishmen</HI> into several parts of <HI>America,</HI> I shall now proceed to give an Account of the Discovery, Plantation, and Set∣tlement of those Countreys and Islands in the <HI>West-In∣dies,</HI> of which the <HI>English</HI> are in Possession at this day, and shall therefore begin with this Country, as being farthest North, and so proceed South, toward the Equinoctial Line, according to my proposed Method.</P>
<P><HI>New found-land</HI> was first discovered by <HI>Sebastian Ca∣bot,</HI> though not then known to be an Island. <HI>Fabian</HI> in his Chronicle says, that in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> the 7th. three Men were brought to the King taken in <HI>New-found-land;</HI> and <HI>Robert Thorn</HI> writes that his Father, and one Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI> were the Discoverers of the <HI>New-found-lands.</HI> In 1530. Mr. <HI>Hore</HI> set out for a further Disco∣very, but was brought to such extremity by Famine, that many of the Company were killed and eaten by their Fellows, and those which returned were so al∣tered that Sir <HI>William Butts</HI> a <HI>Norfolk</HI> Knight, could not know their Son <HI>Thomas,</HI> one of this starved num∣ber, but only by a Wart which grew upon one of his Knees. It is a great Island, judged as big as <HI>England,</HI>
<PB N="61" REF="34"/>
scituated between 46 and 53 Degrees North Latitude. The North part is better Inhabited than the South, though fitter for Habitation; it is furnished upon the Sea coasts with abundance of Cod-fish, Herrings, Salmons, Thorn-back, Oysters and Muscles with Pearls; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t abounds with Bears and Foxes, who will rob you of your Flesh and Fish before your Face. Within Fifty Leagues of the Shore lies a Bank or Ridge of Ground, extending in length many hundred Leagues, in breadth twenty four where broadest, in other places but six∣teen. And all about it are certain Islands, which <HI>Cabot</HI> by one common name called <HI>Bacalaos,</HI> for the great number of Cod-fish which swarmed so much therea∣bout, that it hindred the passage of his Ship.</P>
<P>After the first discovery, the business of Trading thither, was laid aside for many years; in the mean time, the <HI>Normans, Portugals,</HI> and <HI>Brittains</HI> of <HI>France</HI> resorted to it, and changed the names which had been given by the <HI>English</HI> to the Bays and Promontories; but the <HI>English</HI> would not so soon relinquish their pre∣tensions, and therefore in 1583. Sir <HI>Humfry Gilbert</HI> took Possession thereof in the name, and by the Com∣mission of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> forbidding all other Nati∣tions to use Fishing, and intended to have setled an <HI>English</HI> Colony there, but being Wrackt in his return, the setling of the Colony was discontinued till 1608. and then undertook by <HI>John Guy</HI> a Merchant of <HI>Bristol,</HI> who in twenty three days sailed from thence to <HI>Concep∣tion Bay</HI> in <HI>Newfoundland.</HI> In 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1. they had scarce six days of Frost in <HI>October</HI> and <HI>November,</HI> which pre∣sently thawed, the rest of the Months being warmer and dryer than in <HI>Eng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and,</HI> neither were the Brooks Frozen over three Nights together with Ice able to bear a Dog; they had Filberds, Fish, Mackerel and Foxes in the Winter; white Partridges in the Sum∣mer larger than ours, who are much afraid of Ravens, they killed a Wolf with a Mastiff and a Greyhound.</P>
<P>In 1612. They found some Houses of Savages, which were nothing but Poles set round, and meeting
<PB N="62" REF="35"/>
on the Top, ten Foot broad, the Fire in the midst, covered with Deerskins. The People are of a reason∣able stature, beardless, broadfaced, their Faces co∣loured with Oker; some of them went Naked only their Privities covered with a Skin; they believe in one God who Created all things, but have many whimsical notions and ridiculous opinions, for they say, that after God had made all things, he took a number of Arrows, and stuck them in the Ground, from whence Men and Women first sprung up, and have multiplied ever since; a <HI>Sagamor</HI> or Governour being asked concerning the Trinity, answered, there was only one God, one Son, one Mother, and the Sun, which were four. Yet God was above all; be∣ing questioned if they or their Ancestors had heard, that God was come into the World, he said, that he had not seen him; some among them speak visibly to the Devil, and he tells them what they must do as well in War, as other matters.</P>
<P>One <HI>Samuel Chaplain</HI> in 1603. tells of a Feast made by one of their Great Lords in his Cabin; eight or ten Kettles of meat were set on several Fires four yards asunder; The men sate on both sides the room, each having a dish of the Bark of a Tree, one of which was appointed to give every man his portion. Before the meat was boyled one took his Dog and danced a∣bout the Kettles, and when he came before the <HI>Sa∣gamor</HI> threw the Dog down, and then another succeed∣ed in the like exercise, after the Feast they danced with the heads of their Enemies in their hands, sing∣ing all the while; Their Canoos are of the bark of birch, strengthned with little wooden Hoops, they have many Fires in their Cabins, ten housho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds some∣times live together, lying upon skins one by another, and their Dogs with them, which are like Foxes; At another Feast, the men caused all the women and maids to sit in ranks, themselves standing behind sing∣ing, suddenly all the women threw off their Mantles of skins, and stript themselves stark naked, not at all
<PB N="63" REF="35"/>
ashamed of their shame; Their Songs ended they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yed with one voice <HI>Ho, Ho, Ho,</HI> and then covered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hemselves with their mantles, and after a while renued <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir former Songs and nakedness. When a maid is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ourteen or fifteen years old, she hath many Lovers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd uses her pleasure with as many of them as she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leases, for five or six years, and then takes whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he likes for a Husband, provided he be a good Hun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, living chastly with him all her life after, except for barrenness he forsake her.</P>
<P>When any dies they make a Pit, and therein put <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll his goods with the Corps, covering it with Earth, and setting many peices of wood over it, and a stake painted red. They believe the Immortality of the Soul, and that the dead go into a far Countrey to make merry with their Friends. If any fell sick they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent to one <HI>Sagamor Memberton,</HI> a great Conjurer who made Prayers to the Devil, and blowed upon the par∣ty, and cutting him sucks the bloud, if it be a wound <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he heals it after the same manner, applying a round slice of Bever Stones, for which they make him a Present of Venison or skins; If they desire news of things absent, the Spirit answers doubtfully and some∣times false; when the Savages are hungry they con∣sult with this Oracle, and he tells them the place where they shall go, if they find no game, the excuse is, the Beast hath wandered and changed his place, but most times they speed, which makes them believe the Devil to be God, though they do not Worship him; when these Conjurers consult with the Devil, they fix a staff in a Pit, to which they tye a Cord, and putting their Head into the Pit, make Invocations in an unknown Language, with so much stirring and pains, that they sweat again, when the Devil is come, the Wizard persuades them, he holds him fast with his Cord, forcing him to answer before he lets him go. Then he begins to sing something in praise of the Spi∣rit, who hath discovered where there are some Deer, and the other Savages answer in the same Tune, they
<PB N="64" REF="36"/>
then dance and sing in a strange Tongue, after which they make a Fire and leap over it, putting an half Pole out of the top of the Cabbin, wherein they are with something tyed thereto, which the Devil carrieth away. <HI>Memberton</HI> wore about his Neck the mark of his Profession, which was a triangle Purse, with somewhat within it like a Nut, which he said was his Spirit. This Office is Hereditary, they teaching this Mystery of Iniquity to their Sons by Tradition.</P>
<P>In 1613 fifty four <HI>Englishmen,</HI> six women, and two Children wintred there; they killed Bears, Otters and Sables, sowed wheat, Rie, Turneps and Coleworts; their winter was dry and clear with some Frost and Snow, divers had the Scurvy whereto the Turneps there Sown were a Soveraign Remedy. There are Musk Cats and Musk Rats, and near the Coasts is great kil∣ling of <HI>Morses</HI> or Sea Oxen, a small Ship in a short time slew fifteen hundred of them, they are bigger than an Oxe, the Hide dressed is as thick again as a Bulls, they have teeth like Elephants about a foot long, growing downward out of the upper Jaw, and there∣fore less dangerous, it is sold dearer than Ivory, and by some thought as great an Antidote as the Unicorns Horn; The young ones eat like Veal, which the old will defend to the utmost, holding them in their Arms or Forefeet. Out of the Bellies of five of these Fishes, (which live both on the Land and water) they make an Hogshead of Train-Oyle; <HI>Thomas James</HI> says, these Morses sleep in great Companys and have one Centi∣nel or watchman to wake the rest upon occasion. Their skins are short-haired like Seals, their face re∣sembles a Lion, and may therefore more justly be called Sea Lions than Sea Oxen or Horses.</P>
<P>About the great Bank aforementioned (which is covered with Water when the Sea is high &amp; uncover∣ed and dry on the Ebb, on all sides whereof the Sea is 200 Fathom deep) is the great Fishing for Cod, and here the Ships do for the most part stop and make their Freight. It is almost incredible how many
<PB N="65" REF="36"/>
Nations, and of each how many Sail of ships, go year∣ly to fish for these Cods, with the prodigious quantity they take, one man catching an hundred in an hour; They fish with Hooks which are no sooner thrown into the Sea but the greedy Fish snapping the Bait is taken, and drawn on shipboard, where they lay him on a Plank, one cuts off his head, another guts him, and takes out its biggest bones, another salts and barrels it, which being thus ordered is hence transported by the <HI>European</HI> Nations to all parts of Christendom, yea throughout most other parts of the world; They fish only in the day, the Cod not biting in the night, nor doth this fishing last all seasons, but begins toward Spring, and ends in <HI>September,</HI> for in Winter they re∣tire to the bottom of the Sea, where storms and Tem∣pests have no Power.</P>
<P>Near these Coasts is another kind of fishing for Cod which they call <HI>Dried,</HI> as the other <HI>Green Fish.</HI> The Ships retire into some Harbour, &amp; every morning send forth their Shallops two or three Leagues into the Sea, who fail not of their Load by noon or soon after, which they bring to Land and order as the other, after this Fish hath layn some days in Salt they take it out and dry it in the wind laying it again in heaps, and exposing it dayly to the open Air till it be dry, which ought to be good and Temperate to make the Fish saleable, for Mists moisten and make it rot, and the Sun causes yellowness. At this their fishing, the Mariners have likewise the pleasure of taking Fowl without going out of their Vessels, for baiting their Hook with the Cods Liver these Fowls are so greedy that they come by Flocks, and fight who shall get the bait first, which soon proves its death, and one being taken the Hook is no sooner thrown out but another is instantly catch∣ed. In 1623. Sir <HI>George Calvert</HI> after Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> had a Patent for part of <HI>New-found-land</HI> which was erected into the Province of <HI>Avalon,</HI> where he setled a Planta∣tion, and erected a stately house and Fort at Ferriland, where he dwelt for some time, which after his death

Priest disguised with a great Skin, his head hung round with little Skins of Weasels and other Vermine, and a Coronet of Feathers, painted as ugly as the Devil, at the end of every song he used strange and vehement ge∣stures throwing great Cakes of Deer suet and Tobacco into the Fire, thus these howling Devotions continued till 6 a clock at night, and held so 3 days. This they pretended was to know of their God whether any more <HI>English</HI> should arrive, and what they intended to do in that Countrey. They fed Captain <HI>Smith</HI> so high, that he much doubted they would have sacrificed him to their chief Deity, the Image of whom is so deformed that nothing can be more monstrous, the Women like∣wise after he was freed and President of the Company made him a very odd entertainment; Thirty of them came out of the Woods only covered before and behind with a few green leaves, their bodies painted of diffe∣rent colours, the Commander of these Nymphs had on her head a large pair of Staggs Horns, and a Quiver of Arrows at her back with Bow and Arrows in her hand; The rest followed with Horns, and Weapons all alike, they rushed through the Trees with hellish shouts and cryes, dancing about a Fire, which was there made to that purpose, for an hour together. Then they so∣lemnly invited him to their Lodging, where he was no sooner come but they all surrounded him, declaring great kindness to him, and crying, <HI>Love you not me?</HI> after which they feasted him with great variety cook'd after their mad fashion, some singing and dancing all the while, and at last lighted him home with a Firebrand instead of a Torch to his Lodgings.</P>
<P>When they design to make War, they first consult with their Priests and Conjurers, no People being so barbarous almost, but they have their Gods, Priests and Religion, they adore as it were all things, that they think may unavoidably hurt them, as Fire, Wa∣ter, Lightning, Thunder, our great Guns, Muskets and Horses; yea some of them once seeing an <HI>English</HI> Boar were struck with much terror, because he bris∣tled
<PB N="68" REF="38"/>
up his Hair, and gnashed his Teeth, believing him to be the God of the Swine, who was offended with them. The chief God they worship is the Devil, which they call <HI>Okee,</HI> they have conference with him, and fashion themselves into his shape; in their Temples they have his Image il favouredly carved, painted, &amp; adorned with Chains, Copper and Beads, and covered with a Skin; the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sepulchre of their Kings, is commonly neer him, whose bodies are first Imbowelled, dried on a hurdle, adorned with Chains and Beads, and then wrapped in white Skins, over which are Matts, they are afterward in∣tombed orderly in Arches made of Matts, their wealth being placed at their Feet; for their ordinary burials, they dig a deep hole in the Earth with sharp Stakes, and the Corps being wrapped in Skins and Matts, they lay them upon Sticks in the ground, and cover them with Earth. The Burial ended, the Women having their Faces painted black with Cole and Oil, sit mourn∣ing in the Houses twenty four hours together, yelling and howling by turns.</P>
<P>The People are clothed with loose Mantles made of Deer skins, and Aprons of the same round their mid∣dles, all else naked, of stature like to us in <HI>England,</HI> they paint themselves and their Children, and he is most gallant who is most deformed; the Women im∣broider their Legs, Hands and other parts with divers works, as of Serpents and the like, making black Spots in their Flesh. Their Houses are made of small Poles, round, and fastned at the top in a circle, like our Arbours covered with Matts, twice as long as broad; they are exact Archers, and with their Arrows will kill Birds flying, or Beasts running full speed, one of our Men was with an Arrow shot through the Body and both the Arms at once, another <HI>Indian</HI> shot an Arrow of an Ell long through a Target, that a Pistol Bullet could not pierce, their Bows are of tough Hazel, and their strings of Leather, their Arrows of Cane or Ha∣zel, headed with Stones or Horn, and Feathered ar∣tificially, they soon grow heartless, if they find their
<PB N="69" REF="38"/>
Arrows do no Execution; they speak of Men among them, of above two hundred years of Age.</P>
<P>Though the Planting of this Country by the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> was designed by divers, yet it lay much neglected till a small Company of Planters under the Command of Captain <HI>George Popham,</HI> and Captain <HI>Gilbert</HI> were sent over at the charge of Sir <HI>John Popham,</HI> in 1606 to be∣gin a Colony upon a tract of Land about <HI>Saga de hoch</HI> the most Northerly part of <HI>New-England,</HI> but that de∣sign within two years expiring with its first Founder, soon after some Honourable Persons of the West of <HI>England,</HI> commonly called the Council of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> being more certainly informed of several Navigable Rivers, and commodious Havens, with other places fit either for Traffick or Planting, newly discovered by many skilful Navigators, obtained of King <HI>James</HI> the First, a Patent under the Great Seal of all that part of <HI>North-America</HI> called <HI>New-England,</HI> from Forty to Forty eight Degrees of North Latitude. This vast Tract of Land, was in 1612. cantoned and divided by Grants in∣to many lesser parcels, according as Adventurers present∣ed; which Grants being founded upon uncertain and false Descriptions, and Reports of some that Travelled thither, did much interfere one upon another to the great disturbance of the first Planters, so that little Profit was reaped from thence, nor was any greater Improvement made of those Grand Portions of Land, save the erecting some few Cottages for Fishermen, and a few inconsiderable Buildings for the Planters; yea for want of good conduct they were by degrees in a manner quite destitute of Laws and Government, and left to shift for themselves.</P>
<P>This was the beginning of <HI>New-England,</HI> when in the year 1610. One Mr. <HI>Robinson</HI> a Presbyterian, or rather Independent Preacher, and several other <HI>English</HI> then at <HI>Leyden</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> though they had been courteously entertained by the <HI>Dutch</HI> as Strangers, yet foreseeing many inconveniences might happen, and that they could not so well provide for the good of their Poste∣rity
<PB N="70" REF="39"/>
under the Government of a Foreign Nation, they resolved to intreat so much favour from their own So∣vereign Prince, King <HI>James,</HI> as to grant them liberty under the shelter of his Royal Authority, to place them∣selves in some part of <HI>New-England;</HI> having therefore obtained some kind of Patent or Grant for some place about <HI>Hudsons River,</HI> they set Sail from <HI>Plymouth</HI> in <HI>Sep∣tember</HI> for the Southern parts of <HI>New-England,</HI> but as they intended their course thitherward, they were through many dangers, at last, about <HI>November</HI> 11, cast upon a bosom of the South Cape of the <HI>Massachu∣sets</HI> Bay, called <HI>Cape Cod.</HI> When Winter approached so fast that they had no opportunity to remove, and finding some Incouragement from the hopefulness of the Soil, and courtesie of the Heathen, they resolved there to make their aboad, laying the Foundation of a new Colony, which from the last Town they Sailed from in <HI>England</HI> they named <HI>New Plymouth,</HI> contain∣ing no considerable Tract of Land, scarce extending an hundred Miles in length through the whole Cape, and not half so much in breadth where broadest.</P>
<P>From this time to the year 1636. things were very prosperously &amp; successfully carried on in <HI>New-England,</HI> which was much increased in Buildings and Inhabi∣tants, at which time the <HI>Naraganset Indians,</HI> who are the most warlike and Feirce, and much dreaded by all the rest, committed many barbarous outrages upon some of them, and likewise upon the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> as they came occasionally to trade with them, barbarously murdering Captain <HI>Stone,</HI> Captain <HI>Oldham</HI> and others, whereupon the In∣habitants of all the Colonies unanimously falling upon them in 1637. they were easily suppressed, about 700 of them being destroyed, and the rest cut off by their Neighbour <HI>Indians;</HI> Upon which <HI>Miantonimoh</HI> the Cheif of the <HI>Mogehins</HI> expecting to be Sole Lord and Ruler over all the <HI>Indians,</HI> committed many Insolencies upon some others who were in confederacy with the <HI>English</HI> as well as himself, and he being sent for to the
<PB N="71" REF="39"/>
<HI>Massacusets</HI> Court at <HI>Boston,</HI> endevoured to clear him∣self, but was clearly convicted by one of his Fellows named <HI>Ʋncas,</HI> in revenge of which after his return home he made War upon <HI>Ʋncas,</HI> by whom being taken Prisoner, by the advice and Counsel of the <HI>English,</HI> he cut off his head, it being justly feared no firm Peace could be concluded while he was alive; This hap∣pened in 1643. from whence to 1675. there was al∣ways an appearance of Amity and good correspon∣dence on all sides, only in 1671. one <HI>Matoonas</HI> being vexed that an intended design against the <HI>English</HI> did not take effect, out of meer malice against them slew an <HI>Englishman</HI> on the Road; This murtherer was a <HI>Nipnet Indian</HI> and under the command of the Sachem of <HI>Mount Hope,</HI> the Author of all the mischiefs against the <HI>English</HI> in 1675.</P>
<P>Upon a due inquiry therefore of all the Transactions between the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>English</HI> from their first setling on these Coasts there will appear no Ground of quarrel, or provocation given by the <HI>English.</HI> For when <HI>Plymouth</HI> Colony was first planted in 1620. within three months after <HI>Massasoit</HI> the chief <HI>Sachem</HI> or Commander of all that side of the Country repaired thither to the <HI>English,</HI> and entred Solemnly into a League upon the following Articles. 1, <HI>That neither he nor any of his should injureor do hurt to any of their People.</HI> 2. <HI>If any of his hurt the</HI> English <HI>he should send them the Offender to punish.</HI> 3. <HI>If any thing should be taken a∣way by his, he should see it restored and the</HI> English <HI>to do the like to them.</HI> 4. <HI>If any made War unjustly against him they</HI> were to <HI>aid</HI> him, and <HI>he likewise them.</HI> 5. <HI>that he should certify his Neighbour Confederates hereof, that they might be likewise comprized in the Peace.</HI> 6. <HI>That when his men should come to the</HI> English <HI>they should leave their Arms behind.</HI> Which were then Bows and Arrows, and were then their only weapons though now they have learned the use of Guns and Swords as well as the hristians. This League the same Sachem confirmed a little before his death in 1630. coming with his 2 Sons <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Philip</HI> to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and renewing the same for
<PB N="72" REF="40"/>
himself, his Heirs and successors; Yet it is apparent this <HI>Massasoit</HI> never loved the <HI>English,</HI> and would have ingaged them never to have attempted to draw away any of his People from their old <HI>Pagan</HI> superstition and devilish Idolatry to the Christian Religion, but find∣ing they would make no Treaty with him upon such conditions he urged it no further. But this was a bad Omen, that whatever kindness he pretended to the <HI>English,</HI> yet he hated them for being Christians; which strain was more apparent in his Son that suc∣ceeded him and all his People, insomuch that some discerning Persons of that Jurisdiction were afraid that that part of the <HI>Indians</HI> would be all rooted out as it is since come to pass.</P>
<P>Neither was <HI>Passaconaway</HI> the great Sagamore or Sachim of <HI>Merimack</HI> River insensible of the fatal con∣sequence of opposing the <HI>English;</HI> for a Person of Quality relates, that being invited by some Sachims to a great Dance in 1660. <HI>Passaconaway</HI> intending at that time to make his last and farewel Speech to his Children and People that were then all gathered together, he addressed himself to them in this manner; <HI>I am now going the way of all flesh, or ready to die, and not likely to see you ever met together any more, I will now leave this word of Counsel with you, that you take heed how you quarrel with the</HI> English, <HI>for though you may do them much mischief yet assuredly you will all be destroyed and rooted off the Earth it you do: For I was as much an Enemy to them as their first coming into these parts as any one whatsoever, and tryed all ways and Means possible to have destroyed them, at least to have prevented them sitting down here, but could no way effect it, therefore I advise you never to contend with the</HI> English <HI>nor make War with them.</HI> And accordingly his eldest Son as soon as he perceived the <HI>Indians</HI> were up in Arms, with drew himself into some remote place that he might not be hurt either by the <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Indians.</HI> It is observable that this <HI>Passaconoway</HI> was the most noted Pawaw and Sorcerer of all the Country, and might therefore like <HI>Balaam</HI> at that time utter this from some divine Illumination.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="40"/>But to proceed after this digression, after the death of <HI>Massasoit</HI> his eldest Son <HI>Alexander</HI> succeeded about twenty years since, who notwithstanding the League he had entred into with the <HI>English</HI> with his Father in 1639. had no affection to them nor their Religion, but was plotting to rise against them, whereupon a stout Gentleman was sent to bring him before the Council of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> who found him and eighty more in an Hunting-house, where they were just come in from Hunting, leaving all their Guns without Doors, which being seized by the <HI>English,</HI> they then entred the Wigwam, and demanded <HI>Alexander</HI> to go along with them before the Governour; at which Message he was much appalled, but being told that if he stirred or refused to go, he was a dead Man, he was per∣suaded by one of his chief Confidents to go, but such was the Pride of his Spirit, that his very indignation for this surprizal, cast him into a Feaver, whereof he soon after died. After his death <HI>Philip</HI> his Brother, Nick-named King <HI>Philip,</HI> for his haughty Spirit came in his own Person in 1662, with <HI>Sausaman</HI> his Chief Secretary and Counsellor, to renew the former Lea∣gue, that had been made with his Predecessors, and there was as much correspondence betwixt them for the next seven years, as had ever been in former times, and yet without any kind of provocation, this treache∣rous Caitiff in 1676. harboured mischeivous thoughts again them, plotting a General Insurrection in all the <HI>English</HI> Colonies, all the <HI>Indians</HI> being to rise as one man against the Plantations which were next them; which being discovered by <HI>John Sausaman, Philip</HI> there∣upon caused him to be murdered, the Murderers be∣ing apprehended were Executed, and <HI>Philip</HI> fearing his own Head, got openly into Arms, killing, burning and destroying the <HI>English,</HI> and their Habitations, with all manner of Barbarity and Cruelty, which troubles continued almost two years, till at length after several defeats given to <HI>Philip</HI> and his Forces, the loss of his Friends, bereavement of his dear Wife and beloved
<PB N="74" REF="41"/>
Son, whom in his hast he was forced to leave Prisoners to save his own Life, his Treasures taken, and his own Followers plotting against his Life, Divine Vengeance overtook him, for causlesly breaking his League. For having been hunted like a Savage Beast through the Woods, above an hundred Miles backward and for∣ward, at last he was driven to his own Den upon <HI>Mount Hope,</HI> retiring himself with a few of his best Friends in a Swamp, which proved now a Prison to se∣cure him, till the Messengers of death came.</P>
<P>For such was his inveteracy against the <HI>English</HI> that he could not bear any thing should be suggested to him about Peace; insomuch that he caused one of his Con∣federates to be killed for propounding it, which so pro∣voked some of his Company not altogether so desperate as himself, that one of them who was near akin to him that was killed fled to <HI>Road Island,</HI> and infor∣med Captain <HI>Church</HI> were <HI>Philip</HI> was, offering to lead him thither; Upon this welcome news a small Party of <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> came very early in the morning and surrounded his Swamp, from whence as he was endeavouring to make his escape, he was shot through the heart by an <HI>Indian</HI> of his own Nation, for Captain <HI>Church</HI> having appointed an <HI>Englishman</HI> and an <HI>Indian</HI> to stand at such a place of the Swamp where it hapned that Philip was breaking through, the morning being very wet and rainy the <HI>Englishmans</HI> Gun would not fire, the <HI>Indian</HI> having an old Musket with a larg touchhole, it took Fire the more readily, with which <HI>Philip</HI> was dispatcht, the bullet passing directly through his Heart. soon after several of his Confederates and Counsellors were taken, and suffered deserved punishment, and in a while most of these murderers received their condign rewards. It cannot be altogether impertinent, but may discover much of the temper and management of the <HI>Indians</HI> in this War, to insert an account of one <HI>Stock∣well</HI> of <HI>Deerfield,</HI> concerning his Captivity and Re∣demption, with other notable Occurrences during his continuance among them, written with his own hand; and thus follows in his own words.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="41"/><HI>Sept.</HI> 19. 1677. About Sun-set I and another man being together, the <HI>Indians</HI> with great shouting and shooting came upon us, and some other of the <HI>English</HI> hard by, at which we ran to a Swamp for refuge, which they perceiving, made after us, and shot at us, three Guns being discharged upon me; the Swamp being miry, I slipt in and fell down, whereupon an <HI>Indian</HI> stept to me with his Hatchet lift up, to knock me on the head, supposing I was wounded, and unfit for Tra∣vel; it hapned I had a Pistol in my Pocket, which though uncharged, I presented to him, who presently stept back, and told me, if I would yield, I should have no hurt, boasting falsly that they had destroyed all <HI>Hatfield,</HI> and that the Woods were full of <HI>Indians,</HI> whereupon I yielded my self, and so fell into the Ene∣mies hands, and by three of them was led away to the place whence I first fled, where two other <HI>Indians</HI> came running to us, and one lifting up the But-end of his Gun to knock me on the head, the other with his hand put by the blow, and said, I was his friend. I was now near my own House, which the <HI>Indians</HI> burnt last year, and I was about to build up again, and there I had some hopes to escape from them; there was a Horse just by which they bid me take, I did so, but attempted no escape, because the Beast was dull and slow, and I thought they would send me to take my own Horses, which they did, but they were so frighted that I could not come near them, and so fell again into the Enemies hands, who now took me, bound me, and led me away. Soon after I was brought to other Captives, who were that day taken at <HI>Hatfield,</HI> which moved two contrary Passions, Joy to have company, and Sorrow that we were in this miserable condition: We were all pi∣nioned, and led away in the night over the Mountains in dark and hideous ways about four Miles further, be∣fore we took up our place of rest, which was in a dis∣mal place of a Wood on the East-side of that Moun∣tain; we were kept bound all that night, the <HI>Indians</HI> watching us, who as they travelled made strange noi∣ses
<PB N="76" REF="42"/>
as of Wolves, Owls, and other Birds and Beasts, that they might not lose one another, and if followed, might not be discovered by the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>About break of day we marched again, and got over the great River of <HI>Pecomptuck,</HI> there the <HI>Indians</HI> marked out upon Trays the number of their Captives and and Slain, as their manner is: Here I was again in great danger, a quarrel arising whose Captive I was, and I was afraid I must be killed to end the Contro∣versie; they then asked me whose I was, I said, three <HI>Indians</HI> took me, so they agreed to have all a share in me; I had now three Masters, but the chief was he who first laid hands on me, which hapned to be the worst of the company, as <HI>Ashpelon</HI> the <HI>Indian</HI> Captain told me, who was always very kind to me, and a great comfort to the <HI>English.</HI> In this place they gave us Vi∣ctuals which they had brought away from the <HI>English,</HI> and ten Men were again sent out for more plunder, some of whom brought Provision, others corn out of the Meadows upon Horses; from hence we went up a∣bout the Falls, where we crost that River again, when I fell downright Lame of my old Wounds received in the War, but the apprehension of being killed by the <HI>Indians</HI> and what cruel death they would put me to, soon frighted away my pain, and I was very brisk again. We had eleven Horses in that Company, which carried Burdens, and the Women; we Travelled up the Ri∣ver till Night, and then took up our Lodging in a dis∣mal place, being laid on our Backs and staked down, in which posture we lay many Nights together, the manner was, our Arms and Legs being stretched out, were staked fast down, and a Cord put about our Necks, so that we could not possibly stir; the first Night being much tired, I slept as comfortable as ever, the next we lay in the <HI>Squahag</HI> Meadows, our Provision was soon spent, and whilst we were there, the <HI>Indians</HI> went a Hunting, and the <HI>English</HI> Army came out after us. Then the <HI>Indians</HI> moved again, dividing themselves and the Captives into many Companies, that the <HI>En∣glish</HI>
<PB N="77" REF="42"/>
might not follow their Track. At Night having crossed the River, we met again at the place appointed, the next day we repassed it, where we continued a long time, which being about thirty Mile above <HI>Sq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ag,</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> were quite out of fear of the <HI>English,</HI> but much afraid of the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> another sort of <HI>Indians,</HI> Enemies to them.</P>
<P>In this place they built a long Wigwam, and had a great Dance, as they called it, where it was conclud∣ed to burn three of us, having provided Bark for that purpose▪ of whom, as I heard afterward, I was to be one, Serjeant <HI>Plympton</HI> another, and the wife of <HI>Ben∣jamin Wait</HI> the third; I knew not then who they were, yet I understood so much of their Language that I perceived some were designed thereto; That night I could not sleep for fear of the next days work, the <HI>Indians</HI> weary with dancing lay down and slept soundly; The <HI>English</HI> were all loose, whereupon I went out for Wood and mended the Fire, making a noise on pur∣pose but none awaked, I thought if any of the <HI>English</HI> should wake we might kill them all sleeping, to which end I removed out of the way all the Guns and Hatchets, but my heart failing I put all things where they were again. The next day when they intended to burn us our Master and some others spoke for us, and the Evil was prevented at this time; we lay here about three weeks, where I had a shirt brought me to make, one <HI>Indian</HI> said it should be made this way, another a different way, and a third his way, whereupon I told them I would make it according to my cheife Masters Order; Upon this an <HI>Indian</HI> struck me on the face with his Fist, I suddenly rose in anger to return it again which raised a great Habbub, the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>English</HI> coming about me, I was fain to humble my self to my Master which ended the matter. Before I came to this place my three Masters were gone a hunting, and I was left with only one <HI>Indian</HI> (all the company being upon a March) who fell sick so that I was fain to carry his Gun and Hatchet whereby I had opportunity to have
<PB N="78" REF="43"/>
dispatcht him, but did not because the <HI>English</HI> Captives had ingaged the contrary to each other, since if one should run away it would much indanger the remainder; whilst we were here <HI>Benjamin Stebbins,</HI> going with some <HI>Indians</HI> to <HI>Wachuset</HI> Hills made his escape, the tid∣ings whereof caused us all be called in and bound. One of the <HI>Indian</HI> Captains and always our great friend met me coming in and told me <HI>Stebbins</HI> was run away, and the <HI>Indians</HI> spoke of burning us, some were only for burning our fingers, and then biting them off; He said there would be a Court and all would speak their minds, but he would speak last and declare, That the <HI>Indian</HI> who suffered <HI>Stebbins</HI> to make his escape was only in fault, and bid us not fear any hurt should hap∣pen to us, and so it proved accordingly.</P>
<P>Whilst we lingred hereabout, Provision grew scarce, one Bears foot must serve five of us a whole day, we began to eat Horsflesh, and devoured several Horses three only being left alive. At this time the <HI>Indians</HI> had fallen upon <HI>Hadly</HI> where some of them being taken were released upon promise of meeting the <HI>English</HI> on such a Plain to make further Terms. Cap∣tain <HI>Ashpalon</HI> was much for it but the <HI>Sachims</HI> of <HI>Wachu∣set</HI> when they came were against it, yet were willing to meet the <HI>English</HI> only to fall upon and destroy them. <HI>Ashpalon</HI> charged us <HI>English</HI> not to speak a word of this, since mischief would come of it. With these <HI>Indians</HI> from <HI>Wachuset</HI> there came above fourscore Squaws or Wo∣men, and Children, who reported the <HI>English</HI> had taken <HI>Ʋncas</HI> and all his men, and sent them beyon the Seas, whereat they were much inraged, asking us if it were true, we denied it, which made <HI>Ashpalon</HI> angry saying he would no more believe <HI>Englishmen;</HI> They then examined every one a part and dealt worse with us for a time than before: Still Provision was scarce, at length we came to a place called <HI>Squaro Maug River</HI> where we hoped to find Salmon, but came too late, this place I reckon 200 miles above <HI>Deerfield,</HI> then we pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted into two Companys some went one
<PB N="79" REF="43"/>
way, and some another; we passed over a mighty Mountain being eight days in travelling it though we marched very hard, and had every day either Snow or Rain; we observed that on this Mountain all the water ran Northward. Here we likewise wanted pro∣vision, at length we got over and came neer a Lake where we staied a great while to make Canoos wherein to pass over. Here I was frozen, and here again we were like to starve, all the <HI>Indians</HI> went a Hunting but could get nothing, several days they Pawawed or Conjured but to no purpose, then they desired the English to Pray, confessing they could do nothing and would have us try what the Englishmans God could do. I prayed, so did Serjeant <HI>Plympton</HI> in an∣other place, the <HI>Indians</HI> reverently attended morning and night; next day they killed some Bears, then they would needs make us desire a Blessing, and return Thanks at Meals, but after a while they grew weary of it, and the Sachim forbid us, when I was frozen they were very cruel to me because I could not do as at other times.</P>
<P>When we came to the Lake, we were again sadly streightned for Provision, and forc't to eat Touchwood fryed in Bears Grease, at last we found a Company of Racoons, and then we made a Feast, the Custom be∣ing that we must eat all, I perceived I had too much for one time, which an <HI>Indian</HI> that sat by me observ∣ing, bid me slip away some to him under his Coat, and he would hide it for me till another time, this <HI>In∣dian</HI> as soon as he had got my Meat, stood up and made a Speech to the rest, discovering what I had done, whereat they were very angry, and cut me ano∣ther piece, forcing me to drink Racoon Grease, which made me Sick and vomit, I told them I had enough, after which they would give me no more, but still tell me I had Racoon enough, whereby I suffered much, and being Frozen was in great pain, sleeping but little, and yet must do my task that was set me; as they came to the Lake, they killed a great Moose, staying there
<PB N="80" REF="44"/>
till it was all eaten, and then entring upon the Lake, a Storm arose, which indangered us all, but at last we got to an Island, and there the <HI>Indians</HI> went to Powaw∣ing or Conjuring; the Powaw declared that <HI>Benjamin Wait</HI> and another were coming, and that Storm was raised to cast them away; This afterward appeared to be true, though then I believed it not, upon this Island we lay still several days, and then set out again, but a Storm took us, so that we continued to and fro upon certain Islands about three Weeks; we had no Provi∣sion but Racoons, that the <HI>Indians</HI> themselves were afraid of being Starved; they would give me nothing, whereby I was several days without any victuals. At length we went upon the Lake on the Ice, having a lit∣tle Sled, upon which we drew our Loads before Noon I tired, and just then the <HI>Indians</HI> met with some <HI>French∣men;</HI> one of the <HI>Indians</HI> who took me, came and called me all manner of ill names, throwing me on my Back, I told him I could do no more, then he said he must kill me, which I thought he was about to do, for pul∣ling out his Knife, he cut off my Pockets and wrapt them about my Face, and then helped me up, and took my Sled and went away, giving me a bit of Bisket like a Walnut, which he had of the <HI>Frenchman,</HI> and told me he would give me a Pipe of Tobacco; when my Sled was gone, I ran after him, but being tired, soon fell to a foot pace, whereby the <HI>Indians</HI> were out of sight, I followed as well as I could, having many falls upon the Ice, at length I was so spent, I had not strength enough to rise again, but crept to a Tree that lay along, upon which I continued all the cold Night, it being very sharp Weather.</P>
<P>I now counted no other but that I must here die, which whilst I was ruminating of, an <HI>Indian</HI> hollow'd, and I answered, he came to me and called me bad names, telling me if I would not go, he must knock me on the head, I told him he must then do so, he saw how I had wallowed in the Snow, but could not me, hereupon he wrapt me in his Coat, and going
<PB N="81" REF="44"/>
back, sent two <HI>Indians</HI> with a Sled, one said he must knock me on the head, the other said no, they would carry me away and burn me; then they bid me stir my Instep, to see if that were Frozen, I did so, when they saw that, they said there was a Surgeon with the <HI>French,</HI> that could cure me, then they took me upon a Sled, and carried me to the Fire, making much of me, pulling off my wet, and wrapping me in dry Cloths, laying me in a good Bed; they had killed an Otter, and gave me some of the Broth, and a bit of the Flesh, here I slept till toward day, and was then able to get up, and put on my Cloths; one of the <HI>Indians</HI> awaked, and seeing me go, shouted as rejoicing at it. As soon as it was light, I and <HI>Samuel Russel</HI> went afore on the Ice upon a River, they said I must go on Foot as much as I could for fear of Freezing, <HI>Russel</HI> slipt into the River with one Foot, the <HI>Indians</HI> called him back, and dried his Stockings, and then sent us away with an <HI>Indian</HI> Guide, we went four or five Miles before the rest of the <HI>Indians</HI> overtook us, I was then pretty well spent, <HI>Russel</HI> said he was faint, and wondred how I could live, for he said he had ten Meals to my one; I was then laid on the Sled, and they ran away with me on the Ice, the rest and <HI>Russel</HI> came softly after, whose Face I never saw more, nor know what became of him. About Midnight we got neer <HI>Shamblee</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Town where the River was open; when I came to Tra∣vel, I was not able, whereupon an <HI>Indian</HI> who staid with me would carry me a few Rods, and then I would go as many, telling me I would dye if he did not carry me, and that I must tell the <HI>English</HI> how kind he was.</P>
<P>When we came to the first House there was no In∣habitant, the <HI>Indian</HI> and I were both spent and discou∣raged, he said we must now both die; at last he left me alone, and got to another House, from whence came some <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> who brought me in, the <HI>French</HI> were very kind, putting my hands and feet in cold Water, and gave me a dram of Brandy, with a little Hasty-pudding and Milk; when I tasted Vi∣ctuals,
<PB N="82" REF="45"/>
I was very hungry, but they would not suffer me to eat too much; I lay by the Fire with the <HI>In∣dians</HI> that night, yet could not sleep for pain; next morning the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>French</HI> fell out about me, the <HI>Indians</HI> saying, that the <HI>French</HI> loved the <HI>English</HI> better than the <HI>Indians.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> presently turned the <HI>Indians</HI> out of doors, being very careful of me, and all the men in the Town came to see me; here I con∣tinued three or four days, and was invited from one House to another, receiving much civility from a young man, who let me lie in his Bed, and would have bought me, but that the <HI>Indians</HI> demanded an hundred pound; we travelled to a place called <HI>Surril,</HI> whither this young man accompanied me, to prevent my being abused by the <HI>Indians,</HI> he carried me on the Ice one days Jour∣ney, for now I could not go at all, when we came to the place the People were kind. Next day being in much pain, I asked the <HI>Indians</HI> to carry me to the Chy∣rurgions, as they had promised, whereat they were angry, one taking up his Gun to knock me down, but the <HI>French</HI> would not suffer it, falling upon them, and kicking them out of doors; we went away from thence to a place two or three Miles off, where the <HI>Indians</HI> had Wigwams, some of whom knew me, and seemed to pity me; while I was here, which was three or four days, the <HI>French</HI> came to see me, and it being <HI>Christmas</HI> time▪ they brought me Cakes and other Provisions; the <HI>Indians</HI> tried to cure me, but could not; then I asked for the Chyrurgion, at which one of them in anger struck me on the face with his Fist, a <HI>Frenchman</HI> being by, who spoke to him some words, and went his way; soon after came the Captain of the place to the Wigwam, with about twelve Arm∣ed men, and asked where the <HI>Indian</HI> was that struck the <HI>Englishman,</HI> and seizing him, told him, he should go to the Bilboes, and then be hanged: The <HI>Indians</HI> were much terrified at this, as appeared by their counte∣nance and trembling, I would have gone away too, but the <HI>Frenchmen</HI> bid me not fear, the <HI>Indians</HI> durst not hurt me.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="45"/>When that <HI>Indian</HI> was gone, I had two Masters still, I asked them to carry me to that Captain, that I might speak in behalf of the <HI>Indian,</HI> they answered, <HI>I was a Fool, did I think the</HI> Frenchmen <HI>were like the</HI> English, <HI>to say one thing, and do another? they were men of their words.</HI> But at length I prevailed with them to help me thither: and speaking to the Captain by an Interpreter, told him, I desired him to set the <HI>Indian</HI> free, declaring how kind he had been to me; he replyed, <HI>He was a Rogue, and should be hanged;</HI> then I privately alledged, that if he were hanged it might fare the worse with the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Captives; the Captain said, <HI>That ought to be consi∣dered,</HI> whereupon he set him at liberty upon condition he should never strike me more, and bring me every day to his House to eat Victuals; I perceived the com∣mon people did not approve of what the <HI>Indians</HI> acted against the <HI>English.</HI> When he was free, he came and took me about the middle, saying, <HI>I was his Brother, I had saved his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ife once, and he had saved mine,</HI> he said, <HI>thrice;</HI> He then called for Brandy, and made me drink, and had me away to the Wigwam again; when I came there, the <HI>Indians</HI> one after another shook hands with me, and were very kind, thinking no other but I had saved the <HI>Indian</HI>'s life. Next day he carried me to the Captains House, and set me down, they gave me my Victuals and Wine, and being left there a while by the <HI>Indians,</HI> I shewed the Captain and his Wife my Fin∣gers, who were affrighted thereat, and bid me lap it up again, and sent for the Chyrurgion, who when he came, said, he would cure me, and dress<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d it. The <HI>In∣dians</HI> came for me toward night, I told them I could not go with them, whereat being angry, they called me Rogue, and went away. That night I was full of pain, the <HI>French</HI> were afraid I would die, five men did watch me, and strove to keep me chearful, for I was sometimes ready to faint; oft-times they gave me a little Brandy: The next day the Chyrurgion came again and dressed me, and so he did all the while I was among the <HI>French,</HI> which was from <HI>Christmas</HI> till <HI>May.</HI>
<PB N="84" REF="46"/>
I continued in this Captains House till <HI>Benjamin Wai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> came, and my <HI>Indian</HI> Master being in want of Mony, pawned me to the Captain for fourteen Beavers, or the worth of them by such a day, which if he did not pay, he must lose his Pawn, or else sell me for 21 Beavers; but he could get no Beaver, and so I was sold, and in God's good time set at Liberty, and returned to my Friends in <HI>New-England</HI> again.</P>
<P>Though I have already given some Account of the <HI>Indians</HI> in this Country, yet having met with a Rela∣tion of them from one <HI>J. J.</HI> an <HI>Englishman,</HI> in the year 1673. I think it not improper to collect some brief Re∣marks concerning them, and of the present State of the <HI>English</HI> in <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>The People that inhabited this Country are judged to be of the <HI>Tartars</HI> called <HI>Samoids,</HI> who border upon <HI>Muscovia,</HI> and are divided into Tribes, those to the East and North-East are called <HI>Churchers, Tarentines,</HI> and <HI>Monhegans;</HI> To the South are the <HI>Pequets</HI> and <HI>Narra∣gansets,</HI> Westward <HI>Connecticuts</HI> and <HI>Mowhacks;</HI> To the North <HI>Aberginians,</HI> which consist of <HI>Mattachusets Wip∣panaps</HI> and <HI>Tarrentines.</HI> The <HI>Pocanets</HI> live to the West∣ward of <HI>Plymouth.</HI> Not long before the <HI>English</HI> came into the Country hapned a great Mortality among them, especially where the <HI>English</HI> afterward planted. The East and Northern Parts were sore smitten, first by the Plague, after when the <HI>English</HI> came, by the Small Pox, the three Kingdoms or Sagamorships of the <HI>Mattachusets</HI> being before very populous, having under them seven Dukedoms or Petty-<HI>Sagamorships,</HI> but were now by the Plague reduced from thirty thousand to three hundred. There are not now many to the East∣ward, the <HI>Pequods</HI> were destroyed by the <HI>English;</HI> the <HI>Mowhacks</HI> are about five hundred; their Speech is a Dialect of the <HI>Tartars;</HI> they are of Person tall and well limb'd, of a pale and lean Visage, black-eyed, which is counted strongest for sight, and black-hair'd, both smooth and curled, generally wearing it long; they have seldom any Beards, their Teeth very white,

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hort and even, which they account the most necessa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y and best part of man; and as the <HI>Austrians</HI> are known <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y their great Lips, the <HI>Bavarians</HI> by their Pokes un∣der their Chins, the <HI>Jews</HI> by their goggle Eyes; so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>Indians</HI> are remarkable for their flat Noses. The <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndesses</HI> or young Women are some very comely, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound plump faces, and generally plump of their Bo∣dies (as well as the Men,) soft and smooth like a Mole∣skin, of reasonable good complexions, but that they dye themselves Tawny; yet many pretty Brownetto's and small-finger'd Lasses are found amongst them. The <HI>Vetuala</HI>'s or old Women are lean and ugly, yet all of a modest demeanour, considering their <HI>Savage</HI> Breeding; and indeed they shame our <HI>English</HI> Rusticks, whose rudeness in many things exceeds theirs.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> are of disposition very inconstant, crafty, timorous, quick of apprehension, and very ingenious, soon angry, and so malicious, that they seldom forget an injury, and barbarously cruel, witness their direful revenges upon each other; prone to injurious violence and slaughter, by reason of their blood dried up by over-much Fire; very Letcherous, proceeding from adust choler and melancholy, and a salt and sharp hu∣mour; both Men and Women are very thievish, and great haters of Strangers, all of them <HI>Canibals,</HI> or eaters of Human flesh, and so were formerly the Heathen <HI>Irish,</HI> who use to feed upon the Buttocks of Boys, and the Paps of Women. I have read in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Rela∣tions, that the <HI>Indians</HI> would not eat a <HI>Spaniard</HI> till they had kept him two or three days dead to grow tender, because their flesh was hard. At <HI>Martins</HI> Vineyard, an Island that lies South of <HI>Plymouth</HI> in the way to <HI>Vir∣ginia,</HI> certain <HI>Indians</HI> (whilst I was in the Countrey) seiz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d upon a Boat that put into a By Cove, killed the Men, and in a short time eat them up before they were discovered. Their Houses which they call Wig∣wams, are built with Poles pitcht into the ground, commonly round, sometimes square, leaving a hole for the Smoak, covering the rest with Barks of Trees,
<PB N="86" REF="47"/>
and line the inside of their Wigwams with Matts made of Rushes painted with several colours, one good Post they set up in the middle, which reaches to the hole in the top, with a staff across, whereon they hang their Kettle, beneath they set a broad Stone for a back, which keeps the Post from burning, round by the Walls they spread their Matts and Skins, where the Men sleep while their Women dress their Victuals; they have commonly two Doors, one opening to the South, the other to the North, and according as the Wind sits, they close up one Door with Bark, and hang a Deer-skin or the like before the other. Towns they have none, removing always from one place to another for conveniency of food, sometimes where one sort of Fish is plentiful, and then where another. I have seen an hundred of their Wigwams together in a piece of ground, which shews prettily, and within a week they have all vanished. They live chiefly by the Sea∣side, especially in the Spring and Summer: In Winter they go up in the Countrey to hunt Deer and Beaver: Tame Cattel they have none except Lice, and certain Dogs of a wild breed, which they bring up to hunt with.</P>
<P>Wives they have two or three according to their abi∣lity and strength of body, the women have the easiest labour of any in the world, for when their time is come they go out alone carrying a board with them two foot long, and a foot and half broad, boared full of holes on each side, having a foot beneath, and on the top a broad strap of Leather which they put over their forehead, the board hanging at their back; when they come to a convenient Bush or Tree they lay them down, and are delivered in an instant without so much as one groan, they wrap the child up in a young Beaver-skin with his heels close to his Buttocks, and lace him down to the board upon his back, his knees resting upon the foot beneath, then putting the strap of Leather upon their forehead with the Infant hanging at their back home they trudg, and die the Child with a liquor of boil'd Hemlock bark, and then throw him into the

Their Apparrel before the <HI>English</HI> came among them was the skins of wild Beasts with the hair on, Buskings of Deerskin or Moose drest and drawn with lines into several works, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ines being coloured with Yellow, Blue or Red, Pumps too they have made of tough skins with∣out Soles. In winter when the snow will bear them, they fasten to their feet snow-shooes made like a larg Racket for Tennis play, laced on before and behind they wear a square peice of Leather tied about their middle with a string to hide their Secrets, and go bareheaded. But since they have had to do with the <HI>English</HI> they buy of them a cloth called trading cloth of which they make Mantles, Coats with short sleeves and caps for their heads, but the men keep their old Fashion. They are very proud as appears by decking themselves with white and blue beads of their own making, and painting their faces with colours, and sometimes weave curious Coats with Turkies Feathers for their Children; Their Diet is fish, Fowl, Bear, Wild Cat Raccoon and Deer, dried Oysters, Lobsters roasted or dried in the smoak, Lampreys, and dri'd Moose ton∣gues, which they esteem a dish for a Sagamor or Prince, likewise Earthnuts, Chesnuts and divers Berries, they beat their Corn to Powder, and put it into bags which they make use of when Stormy weather hinders them of food.

they cover their wigwams with Barks so close that no Air can enter, and making a great Fire remain there in a stewing heat till they are in an extream sweat, and then run out naked into the Sea or River, and presently after their return they either recover, or give up the Ghost. They die patiently both men and women, not knowing of a Hell to scare them or a Con∣science to terrify them, they howl at their funerals like the wild <HI>Irish,</HI> blaming the Devil for his hard hearted∣nes, and concluding with rude Prayers to him to afflict them no further. They acknowledg a God who they called <HI>Squantam</HI> but worship him not, because they say he will do them no hurt, but <HI>Abbomo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho</HI> or <HI>Cheepie</HI> many times smites them with incurable diseases, scares them with apparitions, and panick Terrors, so that they live in a wretched Consternation, worshipping the Devil for fear.

Their Divinity is not much, yet say, that after death <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey go to Heaven beyond the white Mountains, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>int at <HI>Noahs</HI> Flood by Tradition from their Fathers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffirming, that a great while ago their Country was drowned, and all the People, and other Creatures in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, only one Powaw and his Webb or Wife foreseeing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Flood, fled to the white Mountains, carrying a Hare with them and so escaped, after a while the Po∣waw sent the Hare away, who not returning, imbol∣dened thereby they descended, and lived many years, after having divers Children, from whom the Country was again filled with <HI>Indians;</HI> some of them tell ano∣ther Story, saying the Bever was their Father. Their Learning is very little or none, Poets they may be gue∣ssed by their formal Speeches, sometimes an hour long; Musical too they be, having many pretty od Barba∣rous Tunes, which they sing at Marriages and Feast∣ings.</P>
<P>Their Exercises are Fishing and Hunting, they sometimes Hunt forty or fifty Mile up in the Countrey, especially when they happen upon a Moose or Elk, which is a Creature, or rather if you will a Monster of Superfluity, being in his full growth many times big∣ger than an <HI>English</HI> Ox, the Horns are very big, brancht out into many Palms, and the tips thereof, are sometimes twelve Foot asunder, and in height, from the Toe of the Fore-foot to the pitch of the Shoulder twelve Foot, they are accounted a kind of Deer, and have three young ones at a time, which they hide a Mile asunder, when the <HI>Indians</HI> hunt him, which is commonly in Winter, they run him down sometimes in half a day, otherwhile a whole day, but never give over till he is tired; the Snow being usually four Foot deep, and the Beast very heavy, he sinks every st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p, and as he runs, breaks down the Trees in his way with

his Horns, as big as a Mans Thigh at last they get up and pierce him with their Lances, upon which the poor Creature groans, and walks on heavily, till at length he sinks and falls like a ruined Building, making the Earth shake, becoming a Sacrifice to the Victors, who cut him up, and making a Fire near the place, they there Boil and eat their Venison, fetching their drink from the next Spring, being unacquainted with any other, till the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>English</HI> taught them the use of that cursed Liquor, called <HI>Rum, Rumbullion</HI> or Kill-devil, stronger than Spirit of Wine, drawn from the dross of Sugar and Sugar Canes, which they love dear∣er than their lives, wherewith if they had it, they would be perpetually drunk, though it hath killed many of them, especially old Women.</P>
<P>Their Wars are with their Neighbouring Tribes, but the <HI>Mowhawks</HI> especially, who are Enemies to all other <HI>Indians,</HI> their Weapons were Bows and Arrows, but of late he is a poor <HI>Indian,</HI> that is not Master of two Guns, which they purchase of the <HI>French,</HI> with Powder and Shot; the Victors Flea the Skin off the Skull of the Principal slain Enemies, which they carry away in Triumph; their Prisoners they bring home, the old Men and Women they knock on the Head, the young Women they keep, and the Men of War they Torture to death, as the Eastern <HI>Indians</HI> did two <HI>Mow∣hawks</HI> whilst I was there, they bind him to a Tree and make a great Fire before him, then with sharp Knives, they cut off his Fingers and Toes, then clap upon them hot Embers to sear the Veins; thus they cut him to pieces joint after joint, still applying Fire for stanching the Blood, making the poor Wretch Sing all the while; when Armes and Legs are gone, they Flea the Skin off their Heads, and presently apply thereto a Cap of burning Coals, then they open his Breast and take out his Heart, which while it is yet living in a manner, they give to their old Squa's or Women, who are every one to have a bit of it.

<P>The Town of <HI>New-York</HI> is well seated both for Trade, security and pleasure, in a small Isle called <HI>Manahatan,</HI> at the mouth of the great River <HI>Mohegan,</HI> which is very commodious for Shipping, and about two Leagues broad, the Town is large, built with <HI>Dutch</HI> Brick, <HI>alla Moderna,</HI> consisting of above 500 fair Houses, the meanest not valued under one hundred Pounds, to the Landward it is incompassed with a Wall of good thickness, and fortified at the entrance of the River, so as to command any Ship which passes that way by a Fort called <HI>James-Fort:</HI> It hath a Mayor, Al∣dermen, a Sheriff, and Justices of Peace for their Magistrates; the Inhabitants are most <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> and have a considerable Trade with the <HI>Indians,</HI> for Bever, Otter, Racoon Skins, with other rich Furs; likewise for Bear, Deer and Elk Skins, and are supplyed with Venison and Fowl in the Winter, and Fish in the Summer by the <HI>Indians,</HI> at an easy Price.</P>
<P>The Province of <HI>New-York</HI> formerly contained all that Land, which lies in the North-parts of <HI>America,</HI> betwixt <HI>New-England</HI> and <HI>Mary-Land,</HI> the length to∣ward the North is not fully known, the breadth is about 200 Miles, the principal Rivers are <HI>Hudsons</HI> River, <HI>Raritan</HI> River, and <HI>Delaaware</HI> Bay, the chief Islands are the <HI>Manahatan</HI> Island, <HI>Long</HI> Island, and <HI>Staten</HI> Island;
<PB N="94" REF="51"/>
<HI>Manahatan</HI> Island so called by the <HI>Indians,</HI> lyeth with∣in Land, betwixt forty one and forty two Degrees of North Latitude, and is about fourteen Miles long, and two broad. <HI>New-York</HI> is seated on the West end of this Island, having a small Arm of the Sea, which divides it from <HI>Long</HI> Island on the South. <HI>Long</HI> Island runs East∣ward above an hundred Miles, and is in some places eight, twelve and fourteen Miles broad, Inhabited from one end to the other, having an excellent Soil for all <HI>English</HI> Grain; the Fruits, Trees, and Herbs very good, in <HI>May</HI> you may see the Woods and Fields so curiously bedeckt with Roses, and a multitude of o∣ther delightful Flowers, as equal if not excel many Gardens in <HI>England;</HI> there are several Navigable Ri∣vers which run very swift, and are well furnished with variety of Fish, as the Land is with all sorts of <HI>English</HI> Cattel, besides Deer, Bear, Wolves, Racoons, Ot∣ters, and Wild Fowl in abundance.</P>
<P>There are now but few <HI>Indians</HI> upon the Island, and these not unserviceable to the <HI>English,</HI> being strangely decreased since the <HI>English</HI> first setled there, for not long ago there were six Towns full of them, which are now reduced to two Villages, the rest being cut off by Wars among themselves, or some raging mor∣tal diseases. They live principally by Hunting, Fowl∣ing and Fishing, their Wives tilling the Land, and planting the Corn; They feed on Fish, Fowl and Venison, likewise Polcats, Turtles, Racoon and the like; They build small moveable Tents, which they remove three times a year, cheifly quartering where they plant their Corn, besides their Hunting and Fishing Quarters. Their Recreations are cheifly Football and Cards, at which they will play away all they have, except a Flap to cover their nakedness; They are great Lovers of strong drink, so that except they have enough to be drunk, they care not to drink at all; If there be so many in a company that there is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sufficient to make them all drunk, they usually chuse so many as are proportionable, to that quantity, and
<PB N="95" REF="51"/>
the rest must be Spectators, if any chance to be drunk before he has taken his share, which is ordinarily a Quart of Brandy, Rum or Strong Waters, to shew their Justice, they will forcibly pour the rest down his throat. In these debau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hes they often kill each other, which the Friends of the dead revenge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on the Murderer, unless he purchase his life with money, which is made of a Periwinkle shell, both black and white, strung like beads.</P>
<P>Their Worship is Diabolical, and usually performed but once or twice a year, unless upon some extraordi∣nary occasion, as making war or the like; The time about <HI>Michaelmas</HI> when their Corn is ripe; The day being appointed by their chief Priest or Pawaw most of them go a hunting for venison; when they are all assembled, if the Priest wants money he then tells them, their God will accept no offering but money, which the People believing, every one gives accord∣ing to their ability. The Priest takes the money and putting it into some dishes, sets them upon the top of their low flat-roofed Houses, and falls to invo∣cating their God to come and receive it, which with many loud hollows and outcries, striking the ground with sticks, and beating themselves is performed by the Priest, and seconded by the People. After being thus wearied, a Devil by this Conjuration appears amongst them, sometimes in the shape of a Fowle, a Beast, or a Man, at which the People being amazed not daring to stir, the Priest improves the opportuni∣ty and stepping out makes sure of the money, and then returns to lay the Spirit, who is sometimes gone before he comes back, having taken some of the Com∣pany along with him, but if at such times any <HI>English</HI> come among them it puts a period to their proceeding, and they will desire his absence, saying their God will not come till they are departed. In their Wars they fight no pitcht Battel, but upon their enemies approach, (having first secured their Wives and Children in some Island or thick Swamp) armed
<PB N="96" REF="52"/>
with Guns and Hatchets, they way-lay their Enemies and 'tis counted a great fight where seven or eight are slain.</P>
<P>When an <HI>Indian</HI> dies they bury him upright sitting upon a seat, with his Gun, money, and goods, to furnish him in the other World, which they conceive is Westward, where they shall have great store of Game for Hunting and live at ease; At his buriall his nearest Relations paint their faces black, and make sad lamentations at his Grave once or twice every day, till by time the blackness is worn off their faces, and after that once a year they mourn a fresh for him visi∣ting and trimming up the Grave, not suffering any Grass to grow neer it, fencing it with a hedg, and covering it with Mats for a shelter from the rain. Notwithstanding all this bustle, when an <HI>Indian</HI> is dead his name dies with him, none daring ever after to mention his name, it being not only a breach of their Law, but an affront to his Friends and Relations, as if done on purpose to renew their greife. And every Person who hath the same Name instantly changes it for another, which every one invents for himself, some calling themselves <HI>Ratlesnake,</HI> others <HI>Buckshorn</HI> or the like; Yea if a Person die whose Name is some word used in common speech, they change that word, and invent a new one, which makes a troublesome alteration in their Language. When any one is sick, after some means used by his Friends every one pre∣tending skill in Physick, that proving ineffectual, they send for a Pawaw or Priest, who sitting down by the sick Person without the least inquiry after the distemper ex∣pects a Fee or gift, according to which he proportions his work, beginning with a low voice to call sometimes up∣on one God, and then another, still raising his voice, beating his naked breasts and sides till the sweat runs down, and his breath is almost gone, the little that remains he breathes upon the face of the sick Person three or four times together, and so takes his leave.</P>
<P>Their Weddings are performed without any Cere∣mony, the Match being first made by mony which
<PB N="97" REF="52"/>
being agreed on and given to the woman make a Con∣summation of the Marrage if we may so call it; After which he keeps her during pleasure, and upon the least dislike turns her away and takes another. It is no offence for their married women to lie with an∣other man provided she acquaint her husband, or some of her nearest Relations therewith, but if not, they account it such a fault as is sometimes punishable by death; some write that when an <HI>Indian</HI> woman finds her self with Child, she continues Chaft or untou∣ched by man until her delivery, the like she observes in her giving suck, a strange Custom, which our <HI>Euro∣pean</HI> Ladys would not well relish. An <HI>Indian</HI> may have two, three or more wives if he please, but it is not now so much used as before the <HI>English</HI> came, they being inclined to imitate them in things both good and bad. Any Maid before she is married lies with whom she please for Mony, without the least Scandal or as∣persion, it being not only customary but lawful. They are extream charitable to each other, for if any one has to spare, he freely imparts it to his Freinds, and whatever they get by gaming or otherwise they share one with another, leaving commonly the least part to themselves.</P>
<P>At their <HI>Cantica's</HI> or Dancing Matches, all persons that come are freely entertain'd, it being then Festi∣val time, their Custom is that all but the Dancers have a short stick wherewith they strike the ground, and sing altogether, while those that Dance sometimes Act warlike Postures, and then come in with faces painted black and Red like Warriors, or some all black, others all red, with streaks of white under their Eyes, and so jump and hop about without any Order, uttering many expressions of their designed valour; In other Dances they only shew what Antick Tricks their Igno∣rance will lead them to, wringing their Bodies and Faces in a strange manner, sometimes leaping into the Fire, then catching up a Fire-brand, and biting off a live coal with many such tricks, which more affright than please an <HI>Englishman,</HI> resembling rather a Crew of In∣fernal
<PB N="98" REF="53"/>
Furies than reasonable Creatures; when their King or <HI>Sachem</HI> sits in Council, he hath a Company of armed men to Guard his Person, great respect being shewed him by the People, which chiefly appears by their silence; After he has declared the cause of their Convention he demands their Opinions, ordering who shall begin first, who having delivered his mind, tells them he hath done, for no man interrupts him, though he make never so many long stops and halts, till he says he has no more to say; The Council having all deliver∣ed their Opinions, the King after some pause gives the definitive sentence, which is commonly seconded with a shout from the People, thereby signifying their as∣sent or applause. If any Person be condemned to dye, which is seldom but for murder or incest, the King him∣self goes out in Person, (for they have no Prisons, and the guilty Person flies into the woods) to seek him out, and having found him, the King shoots first, though at never such a distance, and then happy is the man that can shoot him down, who for his pains is made some Captain or military Officer.</P>
<P>Their cloathing is a yard and half of broad cloth, which they hang on their Shoulders, and half a yard of the same being put betwixt their Legs, is tyed up be∣fore and behind, and fastned with a Girdle about their middle hangs with a flap on each side, they wear no hats, but commonly tye either a Snakes skin about their Heads, a belt of their mony, or a kind of Ruff made with Deers hair, and died of a Scarlet Colour, which they esteem very rich; They grease their bo∣dies and hair very often, and paint their faces with divers Colours, as Black, White, Red, Yellow, Blew, which they take great pride in every one being painted in a several manner; Thus much of the Customs of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and the Colony of <HI>New York.</HI></P>

And this <HI>Colony</HI> is <HI>experimentally</HI> found Generally to agree well with <HI>English Constitutions.</HI> For <HI>Navigation</HI> it hath these <HI>Advantages,</HI> not only to be <HI>Scituate</HI> along the Navigable part of <HI>Hudsons River,</HI> but lies also Fifty Miles on the <HI>Main Sea.</HI> And near the midst of this <HI>Province</HI> is that Noted Bay for Ships, within <HI>Sandy Hook,</HI> very well known not to be <HI>inferiour</HI> to any in <HI>America,</HI> where Ships not only <HI>Harbour</HI> in greatest <HI>Storms</HI> but Ride <HI>safe</HI> with all <HI>Winds,</HI> and <HI>Sail</HI> in and out thence, as well in <HI>Winter</HI> as <HI>Summer.</HI> For <HI>Fishery</HI> the Sea Banks there are very well stor'd with variety of <HI>Fish,</HI> not only such as are <HI>profitable</HI> for <HI>Transportation</HI> but fit for <HI>Food</HI> there: As <HI>Whales, Cod-fish, Cole</HI> and <HI>Hake-fish,</HI> large <HI>Mackerill,</HI> and many other sorts of <HI>Flat</HI> and <HI>small Fish.</HI> The <HI>Bay</HI> also and <HI>Hudsons River</HI> are plentifully stored with <HI>Sturgeon, Great Basse,</HI> and other Scale Fish; <HI>Eels</HI> and <HI>Shell-Fish,</HI> as <HI>Oysters,</HI> &amp;c. in great plenty, and easie to take.</P>
<P>This <HI>Country</HI> is <HI>plentifully</HI> supplied with lovely <HI>Springs, Rivuolets, In-land Rivers,</HI> and <HI>Creeks</HI> which fall into the Sea, and <HI>Hudsons-River,</HI> in which is much <HI>plenty</HI> and <HI>variety</HI> of <HI>Fresh-Fish</HI> and <HI>Water-Fowl.</HI> There is great plenty of <HI>Oak-Timber</HI> fit for Shipping, and <HI>Masts</HI> for Ships, and other variety of Wood, like the adjacent Colonies, as <HI>Chesnut, Walnut, Poplar, Cedar, Ash, F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rr,</HI> &amp;c. fit for building within the Country. The <HI>Land</HI> or <HI>Soyle</HI> (as in other places) varies in <HI>goodness</HI> and <HI>richness,</HI> but generally <HI>fertile,</HI> and with much smaller <HI>labour</HI> than in <HI>England,</HI> produceth <HI>plentiful Corps</HI> of all sorts of <HI>English</HI> Grain. Besides <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, which the <HI>English</HI> Planters find not only to be of <HI>vast in∣crease</HI> but very <HI>wholesome</HI> and good in use. It also pro∣duceth good <HI>Flax</HI> and <HI>Hemp,</HI> which they now Spin and Manufacture into Linen Cloth. There's suffi∣cient <HI>Meadow</HI> and <HI>Marsh</HI> to their <HI>Ʋp-lands.</HI> And the very Barrens there (as they are call'd) are not like
<PB N="101" REF="54"/>
some in <HI>England,</HI> but produce Grass fit for <HI>Grazing Cat∣tle</HI> in Summer Season. The Country is <HI>well stored</HI> with wilde <HI>Deer, Conies,</HI> and <HI>wild Fowl</HI> of several sorts, as <HI>Turkeys, Pidgeons, Partridges, Plover, Quailes, Wilde Swans, Geese, Ducks,</HI> &amp;c. in great plenty. It produ∣ceth variety of good and delicious Fruits, as <HI>Grapes, Plumbs, Mulberryes, Apricocks, Peaches, Pears, Apples, Quinces, Water-Melons,</HI> &amp;c. which are here in <HI>England</HI> planted in O'rchards and Gardens: These, as also many other Fruits which come not to <HI>perfection</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> are the more natural product of this Country. There are already great store of <HI>Horses, Cowes, Hogs</HI> and some <HI>Sheep,</HI> which may be bought at reasonable Prises, with <HI>English Monys,</HI> or <HI>English</HI> Commodities, or mans <HI>Labour,</HI> where Monys and Goods are wanting. What sort of <HI>Mine</HI> or <HI>Minerals</HI> are in the Bowels of the Earth, <HI>After-time</HI> must produce, the Inhabitants not having yet employed themselves in search thereof. But there is already a <HI>Smelting-furnace</HI> and <HI>Forge</HI> set up in this Colony, where is made good <HI>Iron,</HI> which is of great benefit to the Country. It is exceedingly well <HI>furnished</HI> with <HI>safe</HI> and covenient <HI>Harbours</HI> for Shipping, which is of great <HI>advantage</HI> to that Country and affords already for <HI>Exportation</HI> great plenty of <HI>Horses;</HI> And also <HI>Beef, Pork, Pipestaves, Boards, Bread, Flowre, Wheat, Barly, Rie, Indian</HI> Corn, Butter and Cheese, which they <HI>Export</HI> for <HI>Barbados, Jamaica, Mevis,</HI> and other adjacent Islands, as also to <HI>Portugal, Spain,</HI> the <HI>Canaries,</HI> &amp;c. their <HI>Whale Oyle</HI> and <HI>Whale-Fins, Bever, Monky, Racoon</HI> and <HI>Martin Skins,</HI> (which this Coun∣try produceth) they <HI>Transport</HI> for <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Scituation and Soyle</HI> of this Country may invite any who are inclin'd to <HI>Transport</HI> themselves into those parts of <HI>America.</HI> For, 1. It being considerably Peo∣pled and Scituate on the Sea Coast, with <HI>convenient Harbours,</HI> and so near adjacent to the <HI>Province</HI> of <HI>New-York,</HI> and <HI>Long Island,</HI> being also well <HI>Peopled Colonies</HI> may be proper for <HI>Merchants, Tradsemen,</HI> and <HI>Navigators.</HI> 2. It's likewise proper for such who are inclined

to <HI>Fishery,</HI> the whole Coast and very <HI>Harbours Mouth's</HI> being fit for it, which has been no <HI>small Rise</HI> to the <HI>New-England</HI> people, and may be here carryed on also with great <HI>advantage.</HI> 3. For its <HI>Soyle</HI> it's proper for all <HI>Industrious</HI> Husband-men, and such who by hard <HI>Labour</HI> here on Rack Rents are scarce able to <HI>maintain themselves,</HI> much less to raise any Estate for their Chil∣dren, may, with God's blessing on their <HI>Labours,</HI> there <HI>live comfortably,</HI> and provide well for their Fa∣milies. 4. For <HI>Carpenters, Bricklayers, Masons Smiths, Mill-wrights</HI> and <HI>Wheel wrights, Bakers, Tanners, Tay∣lors, Weavers, Shoomakers, Hatters,</HI> and all or most Han∣dicrafts, where their <HI>Labour</HI> is much more valued than in these Parts, and Provisions much Cheaper. 5. And <HI>chiefly</HI> for such of the above mentioned, or any other who upon <HI>solid Grounds</HI> and <HI>weighty Considerations</HI> are <HI>in∣clined</HI> in their minds to go into those Parts; without which, their going their, cannot be comfortable, or answer their expectation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indian Natives</HI> in this Country are but few, com∣parative to the <HI>Neighbouring Colonies;</HI> and those that are there are so far from being <HI>formidable</HI> or <HI>injurious</HI> to the <HI>Plan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers</HI> and <HI>Inhabitants,</HI> that they are really <HI>servicable</HI> and <HI>advantageous</HI> to the <HI>English,</HI> not only in <HI>Hunting</HI> and taking the <HI>Deer,</HI> and other wilde <HI>Creatures;</HI> and catching of <HI>Fish</HI> and <HI>Fowl</HI> fit for food in their <HI>Seasons,</HI> but in the <HI>killing</HI> and <HI>destroying</HI> of <HI>Bears, Wolves, Foxes,</HI> and other <HI>Vermine</HI> and <HI>Poltry,</HI> whose Skins and Furrs they bring the <HI>English,</HI> and sell at a less price than the <HI>value</HI> of time an <HI>Englishman</HI> must spend to take them. As for the <HI>Constitutions</HI> of the <HI>Country,</HI> they were made in the Time of <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Barclay,</HI> and Sir <HI>George Car∣teret,</HI> the late <HI>Proprietors</HI> thereof; in which, such pro∣vision was made for Liberty in matters of <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Property</HI> in their <HI>Estates,</HI> that under the <HI>Ferms</HI> thereof that <HI>Colony</HI> has been considerably Peopled, and that, much from the adjacent <HI>Countries,</HI> where they have not only for many years enjoyed their <HI>Estates</HI> according the <HI>Concessions,</HI> but also an <HI>uninterrupted</HI> Exercise of
<PB N="103" REF="55"/>
<HI>their Particular perswasions</HI> in matters of <HI>Religion.</HI> And we the present <HI>Proprietors</HI> so soon as any persons here in <HI>England,</HI> or elsewhere are willing to be <HI>Engaged</HI> with us, shall be ready and desirous to make such farther <HI>Additions</HI> and <HI>Supplements</HI> to the said <HI>Constitutions,</HI> as shall be thought fit for the <HI>encouragement</HI> of all <HI>Planters</HI> and <HI>Ad∣venturers;</HI> And for the farther setling the said <HI>Colony</HI> with a <HI>Sober</HI> and <HI>Industrious People.</HI></P>
<P>Having with all possible brevity given an Account of the <HI>Country,</HI> we shall say something as to the <HI>disposition of Lands there.</HI> 1. Our <HI>Purpose</HI> is, with all convenient <HI>expedition,</HI> to erect and build one Principal Town; which by reason of <HI>Scituation,</HI> must in all <HI>probability</HI> be the most <HI>considerable</HI> for <HI>Merchandize, Trade</HI> and <HI>Fishery</HI> in those Parts. It's designed to be <HI>placed</HI> upon a Neck or Point of <HI>Rich-land</HI> called <HI>Ambo-point,</HI> lying on <HI>Raritor-River,</HI> and pointing to <HI>Sandy-Hook-Bay,</HI> and near <HI>adja∣cent</HI> to the place where <HI>Ships</HI> in that <HI>Great Harbour</HI> commonly <HI>Ride at Anchor:</HI> A <HI>Scheme</HI> of which is alrea∣dy drawn, and those who shall desire to be satisfied therewith many treat for a share thereof. 2. As for <HI>Encouragement</HI> of <HI>Servants,</HI> &amp;c. We allow the same <HI>Pri∣viledges</HI> as were provided in the <HI>Concessions</HI> at first. 3. Such who are desirous to <HI>Purchase</HI> any <HI>Lands</HI> in this <HI>Province, Free from all Charge,</HI> and to pay down their <HI>Purchase</HI> Monys here, for any quantities of <HI>Acres;</HI> Or that desire to take up <HI>Lands</HI> there, upon any small Quit-Rents to be Reserved, shall have Grants to them and their Heirs, on moderate and reasonable Terms. 4. Those who are desirous to <HI>Transport</HI> themselves into those <HI>Parts,</HI> before they Purchase, if any thing there present to their satisfaction, we doubt not but the <HI>Terms</HI> of <HI>Purchase</HI> will be so <HI>Moderate, Equal</HI> and <HI>Encouraging,</HI> that may Engage them to settle in that <HI>Colony.</HI></P>
<P>Our Purpose being with all possible <HI>Expedi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion</HI> to dis∣patch <HI>Persons</HI> thither, with whom they may <HI>Treat;</HI> and who shall have our full <HI>Power</HI> in the <HI>Premises.</HI> As for <HI>Passage</HI> to this <HI>Province, Ships</HI> are going hence the <HI>whole Year about,</HI> as well in Winter as Summer, <HI>Sandy-hook-Bay</HI>

Carriage</HI> of <HI>Goods</HI> is usually 40 <HI><ABBR>s.</ABBR> per</HI> Ton, and sometimes <HI>less,</HI> as we can <HI>Agree.</HI> The <HI>cheapest</HI> and chiefest time of the year for <HI>Passage</HI> is from <HI>Midsummer</HI> till the later end of <HI>Sep∣tember,</HI> when many <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Mary-land Ships</HI> are go∣ing out of <HI>England</HI> into those Parts; and such who take then their <HI>Voyage, arrive</HI> usually in good time to <HI>Plant</HI> Corn <HI>sufficient</HI> for next Summer. The <HI>Goods</HI> to be <HI>carried there,</HI> are first for peoples <HI>own use,</HI> all sorts of <HI>Apparel</HI> and <HI>Houshold-stuff,</HI> and also <HI>Ʋtensils</HI> for <HI>Husban∣dry</HI> and <HI>Building;</HI> and 2dly. <HI>Linen</HI> and <HI>Wollen Cloths,</HI> and <HI>S uffs fitting for Apparel,</HI> &amp;c. which are fit for <HI>Mer∣chandize</HI> and <HI>Truck</HI> there in the <HI>Country,</HI> and that to good <HI>Advantage</HI> for the <HI>Importer; Lastly,</HI> Although this <HI>Country,</HI> by reason of its being already <HI>considerably inhabited,</HI> may <HI>afford</HI> many <HI>conveniencies</HI> to <HI>Strangers,</HI> of which unpeopled Countries are <HI>destitute,</HI> as <HI>Lodging, Victualling,</HI> &amp;c. Yet all persons <HI>inclining</HI> unto those <HI>Parts</HI> must know that in their <HI>Settlement there,</HI> they will find they must have their Winter as well as Summer. They must <HI>Labour</HI> before they <HI>Reap.</HI> And till their Plantations be cleared (in <HI>Summer</HI> time) they must expect, (as in all those <HI>Countries</HI>) the <HI>Muscato</HI> Flyes, Gnats, and such like, may in <HI>Hot and Fair Weather</HI> give them some disturbance, where People provide not a∣gainst them. Which as Land is cleared are less trouble∣some.</P>
<P>The South and South West part of <HI>New-Jersey</HI> lying on the Sea and <HI>Dela ware</HI> River is called <HI>West Jersey</HI> of which Mr. <HI>Edward Billing</HI> is now Proprietor; It hath all the Conveniencies and Excellencies of the other part aforementioned, and may be made one of the best Colonies in <HI>America</HI> for the Scituation, Air and Soil; The Ports, Creeks, good Harbours, and Havens being not inferior to any in that part of the World, having no less than 30 Navigable Creeks ranging themselves at a

Convenient distance upon the Sea, and that stately Ri∣ver of <HI>Dela Ware,</HI> the Shoars whereof are generally very deep and bold. The <HI>English</HI> that are setled here buy the Lands of the Natives, and give them real satis∣faction for the same, whereby they are assured of their love and Friendship for ever, and the poor creatures are never the worse but much better, as themselves confess, being now supplyed by way of Trade with all they want or stand in need of, hunting and fishing as they did before except in inclosed or planted ground, bringing home to the <HI>English</HI> Seven or Eight fat Bucks in a day. There is a Town called <HI>Burlington,</HI> which will quickly be a place of great Trade, their Orchards are so loaden with Fruit that the very Branches have been torn away with the weight thereof, it is delightful to the Eye, and most delicious to the Tast; Peaches in such plenty that they bring them home in Carts, they are very delicate Fruit and hang almost like our Oni∣ons tyed upon Ropes; They receive 40 Bushels of good <HI>English</HI> Wheat for one Bushel sown; Cherries they have in abundance and Fowl and Fish great plen∣ty, with several that are unknown in <HI>England;</HI> There are likewise Bears, Wolves, Foxes, Rattle Snakes, and several other Creatures, as I imagin (saith my Author) because the <HI>Indians</HI> bring such Skins to sell, but I have travelled several hundreds of Miles to and fro, yet ne∣ver to my knowledge saw one of them except 2 Rattle-Snakes, and I killed them both, so that the fear of them i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more than the hurt, neither are we troubled with the Muskato Fly in this place, our Land lying generally high and Healthy, and they being commonly in boggy ground; with common and reasonable care there may in a few years be Horses, Beef, Pork, Flouer, Bisket and Pease to spare, Yea this Country wjll pro∣duce Honey, Wax, Silk, Hemp, Flax, Hops, Woad, Rapeseed, Madder, Potashes, Anniseed and Salt, Hides raw or tanned, and there is a very large vast Creature called a <HI>Moose,</HI> of whose Skins are made excellent Buff; besides the natural product of Pitch, Tar, Rosin, Tur∣pentime,

<HI>&amp;c.</HI> As for furs, there are Beaver, black Fox and Otter with divers other sorts; The Tobacco is ex∣cellent upon the River <HI>Dela Ware;</HI> There may be very good fishing for Cod and Cusk as several have found by experience, who have caught great plenty of well-grown Fish; upon the whole matter this Province af∣fords all that is either for the necessity, conveniency, Profit, or Pleasure of humane life; and it may there∣fore be reasonably expected, that this Country with the rest of <HI>America</HI> may in a few Ages be throughly peopled with Christians: I shall conclude with the Prophecy of the pious, learned and Honoura∣ble Mr. <HI>George Herbert</HI> Oratour to the University of <HI>Cam∣bridge,</HI> written many years since.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Religion</HI> stands on Tiptoe in our Land,</L>

<P>For this <HI>PROVINCE,</HI> the general Condition of it take as followeth. The Country it self in its <HI>Soil, Air, Water, Seasons</HI> and <HI>Produce</HI> both Natural and Artificial is not to be despised. The <HI>Land</HI> containeth divers sorts of <HI>Earth,</HI> as <HI>Sand</HI> Yellow and Black, Poor and Rich: also <HI>Gravel</HI> both Loomy and Dusty; and in some places a <HI>fast fat Earth,</HI> like to our best <HI>Vales</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> espe∣cially by <HI>Inland-Brooks</HI> and <HI>Rivers,</HI> God in his Wisdom having ordered it so, that the <HI>Advantages</HI> of the <HI>Coun∣try</HI> are divided, the <HI>Back-Lands</HI> being generally <HI>three</HI> to <HI>one</HI> Richer than those that ly by <HI>Navigable Waters.</HI> We have much of another <HI>Soyl,</HI> and that is a <HI>black Ha∣sel-Mould,</HI> upon a <HI>Stony</HI> or <HI>Rocky</HI> bottom. The <HI>Air</HI> is sweet and cleer, the Heavens serene, like the <HI>South-parts</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> rarely <HI>Overcast;</HI> and as the <HI>Woods</HI> come by numbers of People to be more <HI>clear'd,</HI> that it self will Refine. The <HI>Waters</HI> are generally good, for the <HI>Rivers</HI> and <HI>Brooks</HI> have mostly <HI>Gravel</HI> and <HI>Stony Bottoms,</HI> and in Number hardly credible. We have also <HI>Mine∣ral Waters,</HI> that operate in the same manner with <HI>Bar∣net</HI> and <HI>North-Hall,</HI> not two Miles from <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> For the <HI>Seasons</HI> of the Year, having by God's goodness now lived over the <HI>Coldest</HI> and <HI>Hottest,</HI> that the <HI>Oldest Liver</HI> in the <HI>Province</HI> can remember, I can say some∣thing to an <HI>English</HI> Understanding. 1st, Of the <HI>Fall,</HI> for then I came in: I found it from the 24th of <HI>Octo∣ber</HI> to the beginning of <HI>December,</HI> as we have it usual∣ly in <HI>England</HI> in <HI>September,</HI> or rather like an <HI>English mild Spring.</HI> From <HI>December</HI> to the beginning of the Month called <HI>March,</HI> we had <HI>sharp Frosty Weather;</HI> not foul, thick black Weather, as our <HI>North-East Winds</HI> bring with them in <HI>England;</HI> but a Skie as clear as in <HI>Summer,</HI> and the Air dry, cold, piercing and hungry; yet I remember not, that I wore more <HI>Clothes</HI> than in <HI>England.</HI> The reason of this <HI>Cold</HI> is given
<PB N="110" REF="59"/>
from the great <HI>Lakes</HI> that are fed by the <HI>Fountains</HI> of <HI>Canada.</HI> The Winter before was as mild, scarce any <HI>Ice</HI> at all; while this for a <HI>few days Froze</HI> up our great River <HI>Delaware.</HI> From that Month to the Month called <HI>June,</HI> we enjoy'd a <HI>sweet Spring,</HI> no <HI>Gusts,</HI> but gentle <HI>Showers</HI> and a fine Skie. Yet this I observe, that the <HI>Winds</HI> here as there, are most Inconstant <HI>Spring</HI> and <HI>Fall,</HI> upon that turn of Nature, than in <HI>Summer</HI> or <HI>Winter.</HI> From thence to this present Month, which ended the <HI>Summer</HI> (commonly speaking) we have had <HI>extraordinary Heats</HI> yet mitigated sometimes by <HI>Cool Breezes.</HI> The <HI>Wind</HI> that ruleth the <HI>Summer season,</HI> is the <HI>South-West;</HI> but <HI>Spring, Fall</HI> and <HI>Winter,</HI> 'tis rare to want the <HI>wholesome North Western</HI> seven dayes together: And whatever <HI>Mists, Fogs</HI> or <HI>Vapours</HI> soul the Heavens by <HI>Easterly</HI> or <HI>Southerly Winds,</HI> in two Hours time are blown away; the <HI>one</HI> is alwayes followed by the <HI>other.</HI> A Remedy that seems to have a peculiar Providence in it to the Inhabitants; the multitude of <HI>Trees</HI> yet stand∣ing, being liable to retain <HI>Mists</HI> and <HI>Vapours,</HI> and yet not one quarter so <HI>think</HI> as I expected.</P>
<P>The <HI>Natural Produce</HI> of the Country, of <HI>Vegetables,</HI> is <HI>Trees, Fruits, Plants, Flowers.</HI> The <HI>Trees</HI> of most note are, the <HI>black Walnut, Cedar, Cyprus, Chestnut, Poplar, Gumwood, Hickery, Saffafrax, Ash, Beech</HI> and <HI>Oak</HI> of divers sorts, as <HI>Red, Whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> &amp; <HI>Black; Spanish Chestnut</HI> and <HI>Swamp,</HI> the most durable of all: of <HI>All</HI> which there is plenty for use of man.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fruits</HI> that I find in the <HI>Woods,</HI> are the <HI>White</HI> and <HI>Black Mulberry, Chestnut, Walnut, Plumbs, Strawberries, Cran∣beries, Hurtleberries</HI> &amp; <HI>Grapes</HI> of divers sorts. The great <HI>Red Grape</HI> (now ripe) called by Ignorance, the <HI>Fox-G ape</HI> (because of the Relish it hath with unskilful Palates) is in it self an extraordinary <HI>Grape,</HI> and by Art doubt∣less may be Cultivated to an excellent <HI>Wine,</HI> if not so sweet, yet little inferior to the <HI>Frontiniack,</HI> as it is not much unlike in tast, Ruddiness set aside, which in such things, as well as Mankind, differs the case much.

like the cluster-Grape of <HI>England,</HI> not yet so ripe as the other; but they tell me, when ripe, sweeter, and that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> only want skilful <HI>Vinerons</HI> to make good use of them: I intend to venture on it with my <HI>French man</HI> this season, who shews some knowledge in those things. Here are also <HI>Peaches,</HI> and very good, and in great quantities, not an <HI>Indian Plantation</HI> without them; but whether naturally here at first, I know not, however one may have them by <HI>Bushels</HI> for little; they make a pleasant <HI>Drink,</HI> and I think not inferior to any <HI>Peach</HI> you have in <HI>England,</HI> except the true <HI>Newington.</HI> 'Tis dis∣putable with me, whether it be best to fall to <HI>Fining</HI> the Fruits of the Country, especially the <HI>Grape,</HI> by the care and skill of Art, or send for <HI>foreign Stems</HI> and <HI>Sets</HI> already good and approved, it seems most reasonable to believe, that not only a thing groweth best, where it naturally grows; but will hardly be equalled by ano∣ther <HI>Species</HI> of the same kind, that doth not naturally grow there. But to resolve the doubt, I intend, if God give me Life, to try <HI>both,</HI> and hope the consequence will be as good <HI>Wine</HI> as any <HI>European</HI> Countries of the same Latitude do yield.</P>
<P>The <HI>Artificial Produce</HI> of the Country, is <HI>Wheat, Bar∣ley, Oats, Rye, Pease, Beanes, Squashes, Pumkins, Water-Melons, Musk-Melons,</HI> and all Herbs and Roots that our Gar∣dens in <HI>England</HI> usually bring forth.</P>
<P>Of living Creatures; <HI>Fish, Fowl</HI> and the Beasts of the Woods, here are divers sorts, some for Food and Profit, and some for Profit only: For Food as well as Profit, the <HI>Elk.</HI> as big as a small <HI>Ox Deer</HI> bigger than ours, <HI>Beaver, Racoon, Rabbits, Squirrels,</HI> and some eat young Bear, and commend it. Of <HI>Fowl</HI> of the Land, there is the <HI>Turkey</HI> (Forty and Fifty Pound weight) which is very great; <HI>Pheasants, Heath-Birds, Pidgeons</HI> and <HI>Partridges</HI> in abundance. Of the Water, the <HI>Swan, Goose,</HI> white and gray, <HI>Brand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Ducks, Teal,</HI> also the <HI>Snipe</HI> and <HI>Curloe,</HI> and that in great Numbers; but the <HI>Duck</HI> and <HI>Teal</HI> excel, nor so good have I ever eat in o∣ther
<PB N="112" REF="60"/>
Countries. Of <HI>Fish,</HI> there is the <HI>Sturgeon, Herring, Rock, Shad, Catshead, Sheepshead, Ele, Smelt, Pearch, Roch;</HI> and in Inland Rivers, <HI>Trout,</HI> some say <HI>Salmon,</HI> above the falls. Of <HI>Shel fish,</HI> we have <HI>Oysters, Crabs, Cockles, Concks</HI> and <HI>Musctas;</HI> some <HI>Oysters six Inches</HI> long, and one sort of <HI>Cockles</HI> as big as the Stewing <HI>Oysters,</HI> they make a rich Broth. The Creatures for Profit only by <HI>Skin</HI> or <HI>Fur,</HI> and that are natural to these parts, are the <HI>Wild Cat, Panther, Otter, Wolf, Fox, Fisher, Minx, Musk-Rat;</HI> and of the Water, the <HI>Whale</HI> for <HI>Oyl,</HI> of which we have good store, and two Companies of <HI>Whalers,</HI> whose Boats are built, will soon begin their Work, which hath the appearance of a considerable Improvement; to say nothing of our reasonable Hopes of good <HI>Cod</HI> in the <HI>Bay.</HI> We have no want of <HI>Horses,</HI> and some are very good and shapely enough; two Ships have been freighted to <HI>Barbadoes</HI> with <HI>Horses</HI> and <HI>Pipe-Staves,</HI> since my coming in. Here is also Plenty of <HI>Cow-Cattel,</HI> and some <HI>Sheep;</HI> the People <HI>Plow</HI> mostly with <HI>Oxen.</HI> There are divers <HI>Plants</HI> that not only the <HI>Indians</HI> tell us, but we have had occasion to prove by <HI>Swellings, Burnings, Cuts,</HI> &amp;c. that they are of great Virtue, sud∣denly curing the Patient: and for <HI>smell,</HI> I have obser∣ved several, especially one, the <HI>wild Mirtle;</HI> the other I know not what to call, but are most <HI>fragrant.</HI> The <HI>Woods</HI> are adorned with lovely <HI>Flowers,</HI> for <HI>colour, great∣ness, figure</HI> and <HI>variety;</HI> I have seen the <HI>Gardens</HI> of <HI>London</HI> best stored with that sort of Beauty, but think they may be improved by our <HI>Woods:</HI> I have sent a few to a Person of Quality this Year for a tryal. Thus much of the <HI>Country,</HI> next of the <HI>Natives</HI> or <HI>Aborigines.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>NATIVES</HI> I shall consider in their <HI>Persons, Language, Manners, Religion</HI> and <HI>Government,</HI> with my sense of their <HI>Original.</HI> For their <HI>Persons,</HI> they are generally tall, streight, well-built, and of singular Pro∣portion; they tread strong and clever, and mostly walk with a lofty Chin: Of Complexion, <HI>Black</HI> but by design, as the <HI>Gypsies</HI> in <HI>England:</HI> They grease them∣selves with Bears fat clarified, and using no defence
<PB N="113" REF="60"/>
against <HI>Son</HI> or <HI>Weather,</HI> their skins must needs be swar∣thy: Their <HI>Eye</HI> is little and black, not unlike a straight-look't <HI>Jew:</HI> The <HI>thick Lip</HI> and <HI>flat Nose,</HI> so frequent with the <HI>East-Indians</HI> and <HI>Blacks,</HI> are not common to them; for I have seen as comely <HI>European-like faces</HI> among them of both, as on your side the Sea; and truly an <HI>Italian Complexion</HI> hath not much more of the <HI>White,</HI> and the <HI>Noses</HI> of several of them have as much of the <HI>Roman.</HI> Their <HI>Language</HI> is lofty, yet narrow, but like the <HI>Hebrew;</HI> in Signification full, like <HI>Short-hand</HI> in writing; <HI>one</HI> word serveth in the place of <HI>three,</HI> and the rest are supplied by the understanding of the Hea∣rer: Imperfect in their <HI>Tenses,</HI> wanting in their <HI>Moods, Participles, Adverbs, Conjunctions, Interjections:</HI> I have made it my business to understand it, that I might not want an Interpreter on any occasion: And I must say, that I know not a Language spoken in <HI>Europe,</HI> that hath words of more sweetness or greatness, in <HI>Accent</HI> and <HI>Emphasis,</HI> than theirs, for Instance, <HI>Octorockon, Ran∣cocas, Oricton, Shakamazon, Poquesin,</HI> all which are names of Places, and have Grandeur in them: Of words of Sweetness, <HI>Anna,</HI> is <HI>Mother;</HI> Issimus, <HI>a Brother;</HI> Netap, <HI>Friend;</HI> usque oret, <HI>very good;</HI> ponc, <HI>Bread;</HI> metse, <HI>eat,</HI> matta, <HI>no,</HI> hatta <HI>to have,</HI> payo, <HI>to come; Se∣passen, Passejon,</HI> the Names of Places; <HI>Tamane, Secane, Menanse, Secatereus,</HI> are the Names of Persons. If one ask them for any thing they have not, they will an∣swer, <HI>matta ne hotta,</HI> which to translate is, <HI>not I have,</HI> instead of <HI>I have not.</HI></P>
<P>Of their <HI>Customs</HI> and <HI>Manners</HI> there is much to be said; I will begin with <HI>Children.</HI> So soon as they are born, they wash them in <HI>Water,</HI> and while very young, and in cold Weather to chuse▪ they <HI>Plunge</HI> them in the Rivers to harden and embolden them. Having wrapt them in a Clout, they lay them on a straight thin Board, a little more than the length and breadth of the Child, and swaddle it fast upon the Board to make it straight; wherefore all <HI>Indians</HI> have flat Heads; and thus they carry them at their Backs.
<PB N="114" REF="61"/>
The Children will go very <HI>young,</HI> at <HI>nine Moneths</HI> com∣monly; they wear only a small Clout round their Waste, till they are big; if <HI>Boys,</HI> they go a Fishing till ripe for the Woods, which is about <HI>Fifteen;</HI> then they Hunt, and after having given some Proofs of their Manhood, by a good return of <HI>Skins,</HI> they may <HI>Marry,</HI> else it is a shame to think of a <HI>Wife.</HI> The <HI>Girls</HI> stay with their Mothers, and help to hoe the Ground, plant Corn and carry Burthens; and they do well to use them to that <HI>Young,</HI> they must do when they are <HI>Old;</HI> for the <HI>Wives</HI> are the true <HI>Servants</HI> of their <HI>Hus∣bands:</HI> otherwise the Men are very affectionate to them. When the <HI>Young Women</HI> are fit for <HI>Marraige,</HI> they wear something upon their Heads for an Adver∣tisement, but so as their Faces are hardly to be seen, but when they please: The <HI>Age</HI> they <HI>Marry</HI> at, if <HI>Wo∣men,</HI> is about <HI>thirteen</HI> and <HI>fourteen;</HI> if <HI>Men, seventeen</HI> and <HI>eighteen;</HI> they are rarely elder. Their <HI>Houses</HI> are <HI>Mats,</HI> or <HI>Barks of Trees</HI> set on Poles, in the fashion of an <HI>Eng∣lish Barn,</HI> but out of the Power of the Winds, for they are hardly higher than a Man; they lie on <HI>Reeds</HI> or <HI>Grass.</HI> In <HI>Travel</HI> they lodge in the <HI>Woods</HI> about a great Fire, with the Mantle of <HI>Duffils</HI> they wear by day, wrapt about them, and a few Boughs stuck round them. Their <HI>Diet</HI> is <HI>Maze</HI> or <HI>Indian Corn,</HI> divers ways prepared; sometimes <HI>Roasted</HI> in the Ashes, sometimes beaten and <HI>Boyled</HI> with Water, which they call <HI>Homine;</HI> they also make <HI>Cakes,</HI> not unpleasant to eat: They have likewise several sorts of <HI>Beans</HI> and <HI>Pease</HI> that are good Nourishment; and the <HI>Woods</HI> and <HI>Rivers</HI> are their <HI>Larder.</HI></P>
<P>If an <HI>European</HI> comes to see them, or calls for Lodg∣ing at their House or <HI>Wigwam,</HI> they give him the best place and first cut. If they come to visit us, they sa∣lute us with an <HI>It ah,</HI> which is as much as to say, <HI>Good be to you,</HI> and set them down, which is mostly on the Ground, close to their Heels, their Legs upright; may be they speak not a word more, but observe all Passa∣ges: If you give them any thing to eat or drink, well,
<PB N="115" REF="61"/>
for they will not ask; and be it little or much if it be with Kindness, they are well pleased, else they go a∣way sullen, but say nothing. They are great <HI>Concealers</HI> of their own <HI>Resentments,</HI> brought to it, I believe, by the <HI>Revenge</HI> that hath been practised among them; in either of these they are not exceeded by the <HI>Italians.</HI> A <HI>Tragical</HI> Instance fell out since I came into the Country; A <HI>King's Daughter</HI> thinking her self slighted by her Husband, in suffering another <HI>Woman</HI> to lie down between them, rose up, went out, pluck't a Root out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Ground, and ate it, upon which she imme∣diately dyed; and for which, last Week he made an <HI>Offering</HI> to her Kindred for <HI>Atonement</HI> and liberty of Marriage; as two others did to the Kindred of their Wives, that dyed a natural Death: For till <HI>Widowers</HI> have done so, they must not <HI>marry</HI> again. Some of the <HI>young Women</HI> are said to take undue liberty before <HI>Marri∣age</HI> for a Portion; but when <HI>marryed,</HI> chaste: when with Child, they know their Husbands no more, till de∣livered; and during their Month, they touch no <HI>Meat</HI> they eat, but with a <HI>Stick,</HI> lest they should de∣file it; nor do their Husbands frequent them, till that time be expired.</P>
<P>But in <HI>Liberality</HI> they excell, nothing is too good for their friend; give them a <HI>fine Gun, Coat,</HI> or other thing it may pass <HI>twenty hands,</HI> before it sticks; <HI>light</HI> of Heart, <HI>strong</HI> Affections, but soon spent; the most <HI>merry</HI> Crea∣tures that live, <HI>Feast</HI> and <HI>Dance</HI> perpetually; they ne∣ver have much, nor want much: <HI>Wealth</HI> circulateth like the <HI>Blood,</HI> all parts partake; and though none shall want what another hath, yet exact Observers of <HI>Pro∣perty.</HI> Some <HI>Kings</HI> have sold, others presented me with several <HI>parcels</HI> of <HI>Land;</HI> the Pay or Presents I made them, were <HI>not hoarded</HI> by the particular Owners, but the <HI>neighbouring Kings</HI> and their <HI>Clans</HI> being present when the Goods were brought out, the Parties chiefly concerned consulted, what and to whom they should give them? To every <HI>King</HI> then, by the hands of a Per∣son for that work appointed, is a proportion sent, so

sorted and folded, and with that <HI>Gravity,</HI> that is ad∣mirable. Then that <HI>King</HI> sub-divideth it in like manner among his Dependants, they hardly leaving themselves an <HI>Equal share</HI> with one of their <HI>Subjects:</HI> and be it on such occasions, at <HI>Festivals,</HI> or at their <HI>common Meals,</HI> the <HI>Kings</HI> distribute, and to themselves <HI>last.</HI> They care for <HI>little,</HI> because they want but <HI>little;</HI> and the Reason is, a <HI>little</HI> contents them: In this they are sufficiently revenged on us; if they are ignorant of our <HI>Pleasures,</HI> they are also free from our <HI>Pains.</HI> They are not disqui∣eted with <HI>Bills of Lading</HI> and <HI>Exchange,</HI> nor perplexed with <HI>Chancery-Suits</HI> and <HI>Exchequer-Reckonings.</HI> We <HI>sweat</HI> and <HI>toil</HI> to live; their <HI>pleasure</HI> feeds them, I mean, their <HI>Hunting, Fishing</HI> and <HI>Fowling,</HI> and this Table is spread every where, they eat twice a day, Morning and Even∣ing, their Seats and Table are the Ground. Since the <HI>Europeans</HI> came into these parts, they are grown great lovers of Strong Liquors, <HI>Rum</HI> especially, and for it exchange the richest of their <HI>Skins</HI> and <HI>Furs:</HI> If they are heated with Liquors, they are restless till they have enough to <HI>sleep;</HI> that is their cry, some more, and I will go to sleep; but when <HI>Drunk,</HI> one of the most wretchedst Spectacles in the World. In <HI>Sickness</HI> impa∣tient to be cured, and for it give any thing, especially for their <HI>Children,</HI> to whom they are extreamly natural; they drink at those times a <HI>Teran</HI> or Decoction of some Roots in spring Water; and if they eat any Flesh, it must be of the Female of any Creature: If they dye, they bury them with their <HI>Apparel,</HI> be they <HI>Men</HI> or <HI>Wo∣men,</HI> and the nearest of Kin fling in something precious with them, as a token of their Love: Their <HI>Mourning</HI> is <HI>blacking</HI> of their <HI>Faces,</HI> which they continue for a year: They are choice of the <HI>Graves</HI> of their <HI>Dead;</HI> for lest they should be lost by time, and fall to common use, they pick off the Grass that grows upon them, and heap up the fallen Earth with great care and exact∣ness.</P>
<P>These poor People are under a dark Night in things relating to <HI>Religion,</HI> to be sure, the <HI>Tradition</HI> of it; yet
<PB N="117" REF="62"/>
they believe a <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Immortality,</HI> without the help of <HI>Metaphysicks;</HI> for they say, <HI>There is a great King that made them, who dwells in a glorious Countrey to the South∣ward of them, and that the Souls of the good shall go thither, where they shall live again.</HI> Their Worship consists of two parts, <HI>Sacrifice</HI> and <HI>Cantico.</HI> Their Sacrifice is their first Fruits; the first and fattest Buck they kill goeth to the fire, where he is all burnt with a Mournful Dit∣ty of him that performeth the Ceremony, but with such marvellous Fervency and Labour of Bo∣dy, that he will even <HI>sweat</HI> to a <HI>foam.</HI> The other part is their <HI>Cantico,</HI> performed by round-<HI>Dances,</HI> some∣times <HI>words,</HI> sometimes <HI>Songs,</HI> then <HI>Shouts,</HI> two being in the middle that begin, and by Singing and Drum∣ming on a Board, direct the <HI>Chorus:</HI> Their Postures in the Dance are very <HI>Antick</HI> and differing, but all keep measure. This is done with equal Earnestness and La∣bour, but great appearance of <HI>Joy.</HI> In the <HI>Fall,</HI> when the <HI>Corn</HI> cometh in, they begin to <HI>feast</HI> one another; there have been two great <HI>Festivals</HI> already, to which all come that will: I was at one my self, their Enter∣tainment was a <HI>green Seat</HI> by a <HI>Spring,</HI> under some shady <HI>Trees,</HI> and twenty <HI>Bucks,</HI> with hot <HI>Cakes</HI> of new <HI>Corn,</HI> both <HI>Wheat</HI> and <HI>Beans,</HI> which they make up in a square form, in the leaves of the Stem, and bake them in the Ashes; and after that they fell to <HI>Dance.</HI> But they that go, must carry a small <HI>Present</HI> of their <HI>Money,</HI> it may be six Pence, which is made in the Bone of a Fish; the black is with them as Gold; the white, Silver; they call it all <HI>Wampum.</HI></P>
<P>Their <HI>Government</HI> is by <HI>Kings,</HI> which they call <HI>Sache∣ma,</HI> and those by <HI>Succession,</HI> but always of the <HI>Mothers-side;</HI> for Instance, the <HI>Children</HI> of him that is now <HI>King</HI> will not succeed, but his <HI>Brother</HI> by the <HI>Mother,</HI> or the <HI>Children</HI> of his <HI>Sister,</HI> whose <HI>Sons</HI> (and after them the <HI>Children</HI> of her <HI>Daughters</HI>) will Reign; for no <HI>Wo∣man</HI> inherits; the Reason they render for this way of <HI>Descent,</HI> is, that their Issue may not be <HI>spurious.</HI> Every <HI>King</HI> hath his <HI>Council,</HI> and that consists of all the <HI>Old</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="63"/>
and <HI>Wise-men</HI> of his <HI>Nation,</HI> which perhaps is two hun∣dred People: nothing of Moment is undertaken, be it <HI>War, Peace, Selling</HI> of <HI>Land</HI> or <HI>Traffick,</HI> without ad∣vising with them; and which is more, with the <HI>Young Men</HI> too. 'Tis admirable to consider, how Powerful the Kings are, and yet how they move by the Breath of their People. I have had occasion to be in <HI>Council</HI> with them upon <HI>Treaties</HI> for <HI>Land,</HI> and to adjust the terms of <HI>Trade;</HI> their Order is thus: The <HI>King</HI> sits in the middle of an half Moon, and hath his <HI>Council,</HI> the <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>Wise</HI> on each hand; behind them, or at a little distance, sit the younger <HI>Fry,</HI> in the same figure. Hav∣ing consulted and resolved their business, the <HI>King</HI> or∣dered one of them to speak to me; he stood up, came to me, and in the Name of his <HI>King</HI> saluted me, then took me by the hand, and told me, <HI>That he was ordered by his</HI> King <HI>to speak to me, and that now it was not he, but the</HI> King <HI>that spoke, because what he should say, was the</HI> King's <HI>mind.</HI> He first pray'd me, <HI>to excuse them that they had not complied with me the last time; he feared, there might be some fault in the Interpreter, being neither</HI> Indian <HI>nor</HI> English; <HI>besides, it was the</HI> Indian <HI>Custom to deliberate, and take up much time in Council, before they resolve; and that if the Young People and Owners of the Land had been as ready as he, I bad not met with so much delay.</HI> Having thus introduced his matter, he fell to the Bounds of the Land they had agreed to dispose of, and the Price, (which now is little and dear, that which would have bought <HI>twenty Miles,</HI> not buying now <HI>two.</HI>) During the time that this Person spoke, not a man of them was observed to whisper or smile; the <HI>Old</HI> Grave, the <HI>Young</HI> Reverend in their <HI>Deportment;</HI> they do speak little, but fervently, and with Elegancy: I have never seen more <HI>natural Sagacity,</HI> considering them without the help, (I was a going to say, the spoil) of <HI>Tradition▪</HI> and he will deserve the Name of <HI>Wise,</HI> that <HI>Out-wits</HI> them in any <HI>Treaty</HI> about a thing they understand. When the Purchase was agreed, great Promises past between us <HI>of Kindness and good Neighbourhood, and that the</HI> Indians
<PB N="119" REF="63"/>
<HI>and</HI> English <HI>must live in Love, as long as the Sun gave light.</HI> Which done, another made a Speech to the <HI>Indians,</HI> in the Name of all the <HI>Sachamakers</HI> or <HI>Kings,</HI> first to tell them what was done; next, to charge and command them, <HI>To love the</HI> Christians, <HI>and particularly live in Peace with me, and the People under my Government: That many Governours had been in the River, but that no Governour had come himself to live and stay here before; and having now such a one that had treated them well, they should never do him or his any wrong.</HI> At every sentence of which they shouted and said, <HI>Amen,</HI> in their way.</P>
<P>The Justice they have is Pecuniary: In case of any Wrong or evil Fact, be it Murther it self, they Atone by Feasts and Presents of their <HI>Wampum,</HI> which is pro∣portioned to the quality of the <HI>Offence</HI> or <HI>Person injured,</HI> or of the <HI>Sex</HI> they are of: For in case they <HI>kill</HI> a <HI>Wo∣man,</HI> they pay double, and the Reason they render, is, <HI>That she breedeth Children, which Men cannot do.</HI> 'Tis rare that they fall out, if Sober; and if Drunk, they for∣give it, saying, <HI>it was the Drink, and not the Man, that abused them.</HI> We have agreed, that in all differences between us, six of each side shall end the matter: Don't abuse them, but let them have Justice, and you win them: The worst is, that they are the worse for the <HI>Christians,</HI> who have propagated their Vices, and yielded them Tradition for ill, and not for good things. But as low an Ebb as they are at, and as in glorious as their Condition looks, the <HI>Christians</HI> have not <HI>out-liv'd</HI> their sight with all their Pretensions to an higher Ma∣nifestation: What good then might not a good Peo∣ple graft, where there is so distinct a Knowledg left between <HI>good</HI> and <HI>evil?</HI> I beseech God to incline the Hearts of all that come into these parts, to <HI>out-live</HI> the Knowledge of the <HI>Natives,</HI> by a fixt Obedience to their greater Knowledge of the Will of God; for it were miserable indeed for us to fall under the just censure of the Poor <HI>Indian</HI> Conscience, while we make profession of things so far <HI>transcending.</HI></P>
<P>For their Original, I am ready to believe them of

the <HI>Jewish</HI> Race, I mean, of the stock of the Ten Tribes, and that for the following Reasons; <HI>first.</HI> They were to go to a Land not Planted or known, which to be sure <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> were, if not <HI>Europe;</HI> and he that intended that extraordinary Judgment upon them, might make the Passage not uneasy to them, as it is not impossible in it self, from the <HI>Easter-most</HI> parts of <HI>Asia,</HI> to the <HI>Wester-most</HI> of <HI>America.</HI> In the next place, I find them of like countenance, and their Children of so lively Resemblance, that a Man would think himself in <HI>Dukes-place</HI> or <HI>Berry-street</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> when he seeth them. But this is not all, they agree in Rites, they rec∣kon by <HI>Moons;</HI> they offer their first Fruits, they have a kind of <HI>Feast</HI> of <HI>Tabernacles;</HI> they are said to lay their <HI>Altar</HI> upon <HI>twelve Stones;</HI> their <HI>Mourning a year, Customs of Women,</HI> with many things that do not now ocur.</P>
<P>So much for the <HI>Natives,</HI> next the <HI>Old Planters</HI> will be considered in this Relation, before I come to our <HI>Colony,</HI> and the Concerns of it. The <HI>first Planters</HI> in these parts were the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and soon after them the <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Finns.</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> applied themselves to <HI>Traffick</HI> the <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Finns</HI> to <HI>Husbandry.</HI> There were some Disputes between them some years, the <HI>Dutch</HI> looking upon them as <HI>Intruders</HI> upon their Purchase and Possession, which was finally ended in the <HI>Surren∣der</HI> made by <HI>John Rizeing,</HI> the <HI>Sweeds</HI> Governour, to <HI>Peter Styresant,</HI> Governour for the <HI>States</HI> of <HI>Holland, Anno.</HI> 1655. The <HI>Dutch</HI> inhabit mostly those parts of the <HI>Province,</HI> that lie upon or near to the <HI>Bay,</HI> and the <HI>Swedes</HI> the <HI>Freshes</HI> of the River <HI>Delaware.</HI> There is no need of giving any Description of them, who are bet∣ter known there than here; but they are a <HI>plain, strong, industrious People,</HI> yet have made no great progress in <HI>Culture</HI> or <HI>propagation</HI> of <HI>fruit-Trees,</HI> as if they desired ra∣ther to have enough, than <HI>Plenty</HI> or <HI>Traffick.</HI> But I pre∣sume, the <HI>Indians</HI> made them the more careless, by fur∣nishing with the means of <HI>Profit,</HI> to wit, <HI>Skins</HI> and <HI>Furs</HI> for <HI>Rum,</HI> and such <HI>strong Liquor.</HI> They kindly receiv∣ed me, as well as the <HI>English,</HI> who were few, before the
<PB N="121" REF="64"/>

<P>There rests, that I speak of the <HI>Condition</HI> we are in, and what <HI>Settlement</HI> we have made, in which <HI>I</HI> will be as short as I can; for I fear, and not without reason, that I have tryed your Patience with this long Story. The <HI>Country</HI> lieth bounded on the <HI>East,</HI> by the River and Bay of <HI>Delaware,</HI> and <HI>Eastern Sea;</HI> it hath the Ad∣vantage of many <HI>Creeks</HI> or <HI>Rivers</HI> rather, that run into the main River or Bay; some Navigable for great Ships; some for small Craft: Those of most Eminen∣cy are <HI>Christina, Brandy-wine, Skilpot</HI> and <HI>Skulkill;</HI> any one of which have room to lay up the <HI>Royal Navy</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> there being from <HI>four</HI> to <HI>eigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fathom</HI> Water. The <HI>lesser Creeks</HI> or <HI>Rivers,</HI> yet convenient for Sloops and Ketches of good Burthen, are <HI>Lewis, Mespilion, Cedar, Dover, Cranbrook, Feversham,</HI> and <HI>Georges</HI> below and <HI>Chi∣chester, Chester, Toacawny Pemmapecka, Fortquessin, Neshi∣menek</HI> and <HI>Pennberry</HI> in the Freshes; many lesser that admit Boats and Shallops. Our People are mostly set∣tled upon the upper Rivers, which are pleasant and sweet, and generally bounded with good Land. The Planted part of the Province and Territories is cast into six Counties, <HI>Philadelphia, Buckingham, Chester, Newcastle, Kent</HI> and <HI>Sussex,</HI> containing about <HI>Four Thou∣sand Souls. Two General Assemblies</HI> have been held, and with such <HI>Concord</HI> and <HI>Dispatch,</HI> that they sate but <HI>three Weeks,</HI> and at least <HI>seventy Laws</HI> were past without one

But of this more here∣after, being yet <HI>Raw</HI> and <HI>New</HI> in our <HI>Geer:</HI> However, I cannot forget their singular Respect to me in this In∣fancy of things, who by their own private <HI>Expences</HI> so early consider'd <HI>Mine</HI> for the <HI>Publick,</HI> as to present me with an <HI>Impost</HI> upon certain Goods Imported and Ex∣ported: Which after my Acknowledgments of their Affection, I did as freely remit to the <HI>Province</HI> and the <HI>Traders</HI> to it. And for the well Government of the said Counties, <HI>Courts</HI> of <HI>Justice</HI> are establisht in every County, with proper Officers, as <HI>Justices, Sheriffs, Clerks, Constables,</HI> &amp;c. which Courts are held every <HI>two Months.</HI> But to prevent Law-Suits, there are <HI>three Peace-makers</HI> chosen by each County-Court, in the nature of com∣mon <HI>Arbitrators,</HI> to hear and end Differences betwixt man and man; and <HI>Spring</HI> and <HI>Fall</HI> there is an <HI>Orphan's Court</HI> in each County, to inspect and regulate the Affairs of <HI>Orphans</HI> and <HI>Widows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Philadelphia,</HI> the Expectation of those that are con∣cern'd in this <HI>Province,</HI> is at last <HI>laid out</HI> to the great Con∣tent of those here, that are any wayes Interested there∣in: The <HI>Scituation</HI> is a Neck of Land, and lieth be∣tween two Navigable Rivers, <HI>Delaware</HI> and <HI>Skulkil,</HI> whereby it hath two Fronts upon the Water, each a <HI>Mile,</HI> and <HI>two</HI> from River to River. <HI>Delaware</HI> is a glo∣rious River but the <HI>Skulkil</HI> being an <HI>hundrod Miles</HI> Boa∣table above the <HI>Falls,</HI> and its Course <HI>North-East</HI> toward the Fountain of <HI>Susquahannah</HI> (that tends to the Heart of the Province, and both sides our own) it is like to be a great part of the Settlement of this Age, in which those who are <HI>Purchasers</HI> of me, will find their <HI>Names</HI> and <HI>Interest.</HI> But this I will say for the good Providence of God, that of all the many Places I have seen in the World, I remember not one better seated; so that it seems to me to have been appointed for a Town, whether we regard the <HI>Rivers,</HI> or the conveniency of the <HI>Coves, Docks, Springs,</HI> the loftiness and soundness of the <HI>Land</HI> and the <HI>Air,</HI> held by the People of those parts to be very good.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> A Prospect of <HI>Mary-land,</HI> with the Plantation, Scituation and Product thereof.</HEAD>
<P>THE Province is bounded on the North with <HI>Pensylvania,</HI> on the East by <HI>Delaware</HI> Bay and the Atlantick Ocean, on the South by <HI>Virginia,</HI> from whence it is parted by the River <HI>Patowmec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; Che∣sopeak</HI> Bay, is the passage for Ships both into this Countrey and <HI>Virginia,</HI> and runs through the middle of <HI>Maryland,</HI> being found Navigable neer 200. miles into the Land, into which fall divers very considera∣ble Rivers. The Climate is very agreeable to the <HI>English</HI> Constitution, especially since the cleering of the ground from Trees and Woods, which formerly caused much unhealthfulness, neither is the heat ex∣tream in Summer, being much qualified by the cool winds from the Sea, and refreshing Showers, and the Winter so moderate as doth no way incommode the Inhabitants. It is seated between 37 and 40 Degrees of North Latitude, and was discovered at the same time with <HI>Virginia;</HI> Our first Discoverers relate many strange Rites and Ceremonies used by the Native <HI>Indians;</HI> Mr. <HI>T. H.</HI> an <HI>Englishman</HI> writes, they believe there are many Gods, which they call <HI>Mantoac,</HI> but of different sorts and degrees, yet that there is one only Chief and Great God which hath been from all Eternity, who, (they say) when he purposed to make the World, created first other Gods of a Principal Order to be as Means and Instruments used in the Creation, and then the Sun, Moon, and Stars as petty Gods; Out of the Waters, they affirm, all the diver∣sity
<PB N="126" REF="67"/>
of Creatures were made, and for Mankind that Woman was made first, who by the assistance of one of the Gods conceived and brought forth Children, but know not how long it was since this was done, having no Arithmetick nor Records, but only Traditi∣on from Father to Son; They make the Images of their Gods in the Shapes of men, placing one at least in their Houses or Temples, where they worship, pray, sing, and make offerings.</P>
<P>They believe, that after this Life, the Soul shall be disposed of according to its works here, either to the habitacle of the Gods to enjoy perpetual happiness, or to a great pit or hole in the furthest part of their Countrey toward Sunset, (which they think the fur∣thest part of the World) there to be burnt continually. This place they call <HI>Popogusso,</HI> and relate that the Grave of one who was buried was the next day seen to move, whereupon his Body was taken up again, who then re∣vived, and declared that his Soul was very near en∣tring into <HI>Popogusso,</HI> had not one of the Gods saved him, and suffered him to return and warn his Friends, to avoid that terrible place; another, being taken up, related, that his Soul was alive, while his Body was in the Grave, and had been Travelling in a long broad way, on both sides whereof, grew delicate Trees bear∣ing excellent Fruits, and at length arrived to most cu∣rious Houses, where he met his Father, that was dead before, who charged him to go back, and shew his Friends, what good they were to do, to enjoy the pleasures of this place, and then to return to him again; whatever tricks or subtilty the Priests use, the Vulgar are hereby very respectful to their Governours, and careful of their Actions, though in Criminal Causes they inflict punishments, according to the quality of the offence; they are great Necromancers, and ac∣count our Fire-works, Guns, and Writing to be the Works of Gods rather than Men; when one of their Kings was sick, he sent to the <HI>English</HI> to pray for him; some of them imagin that we are not mortal Men, nor
<PB N="127" REF="67"/>
born of women, but an old Generation revived, and believe that there are more of us yet to come to kil their nation and take their places, who are at present invisibly in the Air without bodys, and that at their Intercession they cause those of their Nation to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, who wrong the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>Their Idol they place in the innermost room of their House, of whom they relate incredible storys; they carry it with them to the Wars and ask Counsel thereof, as the <HI>Romans</HI> did of their Oracles; They sing Songs as they march toward battel instead of Drums and Trumpets, their Wars are exceeding bloudy and have wasted the people very much. A certain King, called <HI>Piemacum,</HI> having invited many men and Women of the <HI>Secotans</HI> to a Feast, whilst they were merry and praying before their Idol came upon them and slew them; When one of their Kings had conspired against the <HI>English,</HI> a Chiefman about him said, <HI>That we were the servants of God, and not subject to be destroyed by them, and that when we were dead we could do them more hurt than when alive.</HI> One <HI>Owen Griffin</HI> an Eye-witness thus tells of their Ceremonies; The eldest among them riseth upright, the rest sitting still, and looking about cryes out aloud <HI>Baw Waw,</HI> then the women fall down and lie upon the ground, and repeating <HI>Baw Waw</HI> altogether, fall to stamping furi∣ously with both feet round the Fire making the ground shake with dreadful shoutings and outcryes, thrusting firebrands into the Earth and then ceasing a while of a sudden they begin as before, stamping till the younger sort fetched many stones from the shoar, of which every man took one, and first beat upon them with their firesticks, and then the earth with all their strength, in which exercise they continued above two hours, after which, they that had wives withdrew themselves with them severally into the Woods, this seemed to be their Evening, Devotion; when they have obtained some great Victory or deliverance, they use solemn rejoycing by making a great Fire, and
<PB N="128" REF="68"/>
incompassing the same promiscuously men and women together, making a great noise with rattles in their hands; Once a year they hold a great Festival, meet∣ing together out of divers Villages, each having a cer∣tain Mark or Character on his back, whereby it may be discerned, whose Subject he is; The place where they meet is spacious, and round about are Posts carved on the top like a Nuns head, in the midst are three of the fairest Virgins lovingly imbracing and clasping each other, about this living Image and Artificial Circle they dance in their Savage manner. Their chief Idol called <HI>Kiwasa</HI> is made of wood four foot High, the face resembling the Inhabitants of <HI>Florida,</HI> painted with flesh-colour, the brest white, the other parts black, the legs only spotted with white, with chains and strings of Beads about his Neck; This Idol is the keeper of the dead bodies of their Kings, which are advanced on Scaffolds nine or ten foot high, this <HI>Kiwasa</HI> or Guardian being placed neer them, and underneath lives a Priest who there mumbleth his Devotions Night and Day.</P>
<P>The Countrey is generally plain and even, the soyl rich and Fertile naturally, producing all such Commo∣dities as are found in <HI>New-England,</HI> as to Fish, Fruits, Plants Roots. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The chief Trade of the <HI>English</HI> there is Tobacco, which is not inconsiderable, since an hundred sail of Ships have in one year traded thither from <HI>England</HI> and the neighbouring <HI>English</HI> Plantati∣ons.

<P>THis Countrey with the other adjoining Coasts, was first discovered by <HI>Sebastian Cabot</HI> with his <HI>English</HI> Mariners in 1497. And may therefore be just∣ly claimed by <HI>England,</HI> it was afterward visited by Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> and called <HI>Virginia</HI> by Sir <HI>Walter Raw∣leigh</HI> in honour of his Virgin Mistress, Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> In 1603. some Persons at <HI>Bristow</HI> by leave from Sir <HI>Wal∣ter Rawleigh,</HI> who had the Propriety thereof, made a Voyage thither, who discovered <HI>Whitson</HI>-Bay in forty one Degrees, the People used Snakeskins of six Foot long for Girdles, and were exceedingly ravished with the Musick of a Gittern Boy, dancing in a ring about him, they were more afraid of two <HI>English</HI> Mastives than of twenty Men; In 1607. Sir <HI>John Popham,</HI> and others setled a Plantation at the mouth of the River <HI>Sagahadoc,</HI> the Captain <HI>James Davis</HI> chose a small place, almost an Island to set down in, where having heard a Sermon, read their Patent and Laws, and Built a Fort,
<PB N="130" REF="69"/>
they Sailed to discover further up the River and Coun∣trey, and encountred with an Island, where was a great Fall of Water, over which they haled their Boat with a Rope, and came to another Fall, shallow, swift and unpassable, they found the Countrey stored with white and red Grapes, good Hops, Onions, Gar∣lick, Oaks, Walnuts, and the Soil good, the Head of the River being in about forty five Degrees; they cal∣led their Fort St. <HI>George,</HI> Captain <HI>George Popham</HI> being President, the People seemed much affected with our Mens Devotions, and would say, <HI>King</HI> James <HI>is a good King, and his God a good God, but our God</HI> Tanto <HI>a naugh∣ty God;</HI> which is the name of the evil Spirit that haunts them every new Moon, and makes them Worship him for fear; he commanded the <HI>Indians</HI> not to converse nor come near the <HI>English,</HI> threatning some to kill them, and to inflict Sickness upon others if they dis∣obeyed him, beginning with two of their <HI>Saga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nors</HI> or Kings Children, affirming he had power to do the like against the <HI>English,</HI> and would execute it on them the next new Moon. The Natives told our Men of <HI>Cannibals</HI> near <HI>Sagadohoc,</HI> with Teeth three Inches long, but they saw them not. In <HI>January</HI> they had in the space of seven hours Thunder, Lightning, Rain, Frost and Snow all in abundance; they found a Bath two Miles about, so hot they could not drink of it. One of the Savages for a Straw-hat and Knife stript himself of his Clothing of Bevers Skins worth in <HI>England</HI> 50 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> or 3 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR>
to Present them to the President, leaving only a Flap to cover his Nudities.</P>
<P>About this time Captain <HI>Gosnold</HI> set Sail for <HI>Virginia,</HI> and arrived there after long contending with furious Storms and Tempests; and soon after by the Industry of Captain <HI>Smith, James-Town</HI> was Built, the Savages supplying their necessities which were sometimes very extream; the Winter approaching, the Rivers afford∣ed them plenty of Cranes, Swans, Geese, Ducks, wherewith they had Pease, and Wild Beasts, as Be∣vers, Otters, Martins, and black Foxes, upon which
<PB N="131" REF="69"/>
they daily Feasted; but in the discovery of <HI>Chickaha∣mine</HI> River, <HI>George Casson</HI> was surprized, and <HI>Smith</HI> with two others beset with two hundred Savages, his Men Slain, and himself in a Quagmire taken Prisoner, but after a Month, he procured not only his Liberty, but was in great esteem among them, being extreamly pleased with his Discourses of God, Nature and Art, and had Royal Entertainment from <HI>Powhatan</HI> one of their Emperours, who sat in State upon his Bed of Matts, his Pillow of Leather imbroidered with Pearl and white Beads, attired with a Robe of Skins as large as an <HI>Irish</HI> Mantle, at his Head sat a handsom young Woman, and another at his Feet, and on each side the Room, twenty others, their Heads and Shoulders painted red with a great Chain of white Beads about their Necks, and a Robe of Skins large like an <HI>Irish</HI> Mantle, before these sat his chiefest Men in their Or∣ders: in this Palace or Arbour, one <HI>Newport,</HI> who ac∣companied Captain <HI>Smith,</HI> gave the Emperour a Boy, in requital whereof, <HI>Powhatan</HI> bestowed upon him <HI>Namontack</HI> his Servant, who was after brought into <HI>England;</HI> yet after this <HI>Powhatan</HI> treacherously con∣trived the Murther of sixteen of our Men, which was happily prevented by Captain <HI>Smith,</HI> who seized ano∣ther of their Kings, and thereby procured Peace from them on his own Terms.</P>
<P>This <HI>Powhatan</HI> had about thirty Kings under him, his Treasure consisted of Skins, Copper, Pearls, Beads, and the like, kept in a house on purpose against the time of his Burial; this House was fifty or sixty Yards long, frequented only by Priests, at the four Corners stood four Images as Centinels, one of a Bear, another a Dragon, a third a Leopard, and the fourth a Giant; he hath as many Women as he please, whom when he is weary of, he bestows upon his Favourites; his Will and the Customs of the Countrey are his Laws, Malefactors are punished, by broiling to death, in∣compassed with Fire, and divers other Tortures; Mr. <HI>White</HI> relates, that about ten Mile from <HI>James</HI>-Town,
<PB N="132" REF="70"/>
one of their Kings made a Feast in the Woods, the People were monstrously painted, some like black Devils, with Horns, and their Hair loose of divers Colours, they continued two days dancing in a circle of a Quarter of a Mile about, fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in a rank, in two Companies, using several Antick Tricks, the King leading the dance; all in the midst had black Horns on their Heads, and Green Boughs in their Hands, next whom were four or five Principal Men differently painted, who with Clubs beat those forward that tired in the Dance, which held so long that they were nei∣ther able to go nor stand; they made a hellish noise, and every one throwing away his Bough, ran clapping their Hands up into a Tree, and tearing down a Branch fell into their Order again. After this fifteen of their properest Boys between ten and fifteen years old, painted white, were brought forth to the People, who spent the Forenoon in dancing and finging about them with rattles; Then the Children were fetched away, the Women weeping and passionately crying out, pro∣viding Moss Skins, Matts and dry Wood, making Wreaths for their Heads, and decking their Hair with Leaves, after which they were all cast on an heap in a Valley as dead, where a great Feast was made for all the Company for two Hours, they then fell again into a Circle and danced about the Youths, causing a Fire to be made upon an Altar, which our Men thought was designed to Sacrifice them to the Devil, but it was a mistake, and the <HI>Indians</HI> deluded our Men by false Stories, one denying and another affirming the same thing, being either ignorant or unwilling to discover the devilish Mysteries of their Religion; but Captain <HI>Smith</HI> says, that a King being demanded the meaning of this Sacrifice, answered, <HI>that the Children were not all dead, but that</HI> Okee <HI>or the Devil, did suck the Blood from their left Breast, till some of them died, but the rest were kept in the Wilderness till nine Moons were expired, during which they must not converse with any, and of these were made Priests and Conjurers.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="70"/>They think these Sacrifices so necessary, that if omit∣ted, they believe their <HI>Okee</HI> or Devil, and their other Gods would hinder them from having any Deer, Tur∣kies, Corn or Fish, and would likewise make a great Slaughter among them. They imagin their Priests af∣ter death go beyond the Mountains toward the Sun-setting, and remain there continually in the shape of their <HI>Okee,</HI> having their Heads painted with Oil, and finely trimmed with Feathers, being furnished with Beads, Hatchets, Copper and Tobacco, never ceasing to dance and sing with their Predecessors, yet they suppose the Common People shall dye like Beasts, and never live after death; some of their Priests were so far convinced, that they declared they believed, our God exceeded theirs, as much as our Guns did their Bows and Arrows, and sent many Presents to the Pre∣sident, intreating him to pray to his God for Rain, for their God would not send them any. By break of day before they eat or drink, the Men, Women and Chil∣dren above ten years old run into the Water, and there wash a good space till the Sun arise, then they offer Sacrifice to it, strewing Tobacco on the Land and Water, repeating the same Ceremonies at Sun set; <HI>George Casson</HI> aforementioned was Sacrificed, as they thought, to the Devil, being stript naked and bound to two Stakes with his back against a great Fire, af∣ter which they ript up his Belly and burnt his Bowels, drying his Flesh to the Bones, which they kept above ground in a by Room; many other <HI>Englishmen</HI> were cruelly and treacherously Executed by them, though perhaps not Sacrificed, and none had escaped if their Ambushes had succeeded. <HI>Powhatan</HI> invited one Cap∣tain <HI>Ratcliff</HI> and thirty others to Trade for Corn, and having brought them within his Ambush, Murdered them all.</P>
<P>One <HI>Tomocomo</HI> an <HI>Indian</HI> and Counsellor to one of their Kings, came into <HI>England</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> the first, who landing in the West was much surprized at our plenty of Corn and Trees, imagining
<PB N="134" REF="71"/>
we ventured into their Countrey to supply those de∣fects, he began then to number the Men he met with, but his Arithmetick soon failed him; he related that <HI>Okee</HI> their God did often appear to him in his Temple, to which purpose four of their Priests go into the House, and using certain strange words and gestures, eight more are called in, to whom he discovers what his will is; upon him they depend in all their Proceed∣ings, as in taking Journeys or the like; sometimes when they resolve to go on hunting, he by some known token will direct where they shall find Game, which they with great cheerfulness acknowledging, follow his directions, and many times succeed therein; he appears like a handsom <HI>Indian</HI> with long black Locks of Hair, after he hath staid with his twelve Confede∣rates for some time, he ascendeth into the Air from whence he came. The Natives think it a disgrace to fear death, and therefore when they must dye, they do it resolutely, as it happened to one who robbed an <HI>Englishman,</HI> and was by <HI>Powhatan</HI> (vpon complaint made against him,) fetched sixty Miles from the place where he lay concealed, and by this <HI>Tomocomo</HI> Execut∣ed in the presence of the <HI>English,</HI> his Brains being knockt out, without the least shew of fear or terrour.</P>
<P>The <HI>Virginians</HI> are not born so swarthy as they ap∣pear, their hair is generally black, few men have beards, because they pluck out the hair that would grow, their Ointments and smoaky houses do in a great measure cause their blackness, whereby they look like Bacon, they have one wife, many Concubines, and are likewise Sodomites; The Ancient Women are used for Cooks, Barbers, and other services, the younger for dalliance, they are modest in their car∣riage, and seldom quarrel, in entertaining a stranger they spread a Matt for him to sit down, and then dance before him, they wear their nails long to flea their Deer, and put Bows and Arrows into the Hands of their Children, before they are six years old. In each Ear they have generally three great holes where∣in
<PB N="135" REF="71"/>
they commonly hang chains, bracelets, or Copper, some wear a Snake therein coloured green and yellow near half a yard long, which crawling about their necks offers to kiss their lips, others have a dead Rat tyed by the Tail. The Women raze their bodies, legs and thighs with an Iron in curious knots, and Shapes of Fowles, Fishes, &amp; Beasts, and Rub a painting therein which will never come out; The Queen of <HI>Apametica</HI> was attired with a Coronet beset with many white Bones; with Copper in her ears, and a Chain of the same six times incompassing her neck; The <HI>Sasquehanocks</HI> are Giant-like people, very monstrous in proportion, behaviour and attire, their voice sounds as if out of a Cave, their Garments are Bears-Skins, hanged with Bears Paws, a Wolfes head, and such odd Jewels; their Tobacco Pipes, three quarters of a yard long with the head of some beast at the end so weighty as to beat out the brains of a Horse. The calf of one of their legs was mea∣sured three quarters of a yard about, their other limbs being proportionable. They have divers ridiculous conceits concerning their Original, as that a Hare came into their Countrey, and made the first men and after preserved them from a great Serpent, and two other Hares coming thither, the first killed a Deer for their entertainment, which was then the only Deer in the World, and strewing the hairs of that Deers hide, e∣very Hair proved a Deer.</P>
<P><HI>Virginia</HI> after the first discovery cost no small pains and experience before it was brought to perfection, with the loss of many <HI>Englishmens</HI> lives. In the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> the first, a Patent was granted to certain Persons as a Corporation, who were called, <HI>The Com∣pany of Adventurers of Virginia.</HI> But upon several misde∣meanors &amp; miscarriages in 1623 the Patent was made void, &amp; it hath been since free for all his Majesties Sub∣jects to trade to; It is Scituate South of <HI>Mary-land,</HI> and hath the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean on the East; The Air is good, and the Climate so agreeable to the <HI>English,</HI> especially since the cleering it from Woods, that few

The Soil is so fruitful that an Acre of ground commonly yeilds 200 Bushels of Corn, and produces readily the Grain, Fruits, Plants, Seeds, and Roots, which are brought from <HI>England,</HI> besides those that are natural to this Countrey and the rest of <HI>America.</HI> They have plenty of Beasts, Fish, and Fowl, some of their Turkeys being affirmed to weigh six stone or 48 pound; The Mockbird is very delightful, imitating the notes of all other Birds. The Produce of this Country are <HI>Flax, Hemp, Woad, Madder, Pot-ashes, Hops, Honey, Wax, Rape-seed, Annise-seed, Silk</HI> if they would make it, since Mulberry Trees grow here in so great plenty, several sweet Gums and excellent Balsoms, <HI>Allum, Iron, Cop∣per;</HI> divers sorts of Woods, and Plants used by Dyers, together with <HI>Pitch, Tar, Rozin, Turpentine,</HI> and sun∣dry sorts of rich Furs, Elk-skins, and other Hides; but above all, Tobacco, which is their principal Com∣modity, and the Standard whereby all the rest are prized.</P>
<P>This Countrey is well watered with many great, and swift Rivers that lose themselves in the Gulf or Bay of <HI>Chesapeak,</HI> which gives entrance into this Countrey as well as <HI>Mary-land,</HI> being a very large and Capacious Bay, and running up into the Countrey Northward a∣bove two hundred Miles; The Rivers of most Account are <HI>James</HI> River, navigable a hundred and fifty miles, <HI>York</HI> River large and navigable above 60 miles, and <HI>Rapahanok</HI> Navigable above a hundred and twenty miles; Adjoining to these Rivers are the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> setled for the conveniency of shipping, having several Towns, the chief whereof is <HI>James</HI>-Town com∣modiously seated on <HI>James</HI>-River, very neat and well beautified with Brick Houses, where are kept the Courts of Judic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ure, and all Publick Offices which con∣cern the Countrey.

<P><HI>CArolina,</HI> so called from his late Majesty King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second of Glorious memory, is a Co∣lony not long since established by the <HI>English,</HI> and is that part of <HI>Florida</HI> adjoining to <HI>Virginia,</HI> between twenty nine and thirty six degrees of Northern La∣titude; On the East it is washed with the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, and is bounded on the West by <HI>Mare Pacificum</HI> or the South Sea, and within these bounds is contained the most fertile and pleasant part of <HI>Florida</HI> which is so much commended by the <HI>Spanish</HI> Authors; Of which I cannot give a more ample Account than has been done already by an <HI>Englishman,</HI> who has lived, and was concerned in the settlement thereof, and shall therefore
<PB N="138" REF="73"/>
repeat what he has deliveted in his own words.</P>
<P>This <HI>Province</HI> of <HI>Carolina</HI> was in the Year 1663. Granted by <HI>Letters Patents</HI> of his late Gracious <HI>Ma∣jesty,</HI> in Propriety unto the Right Honourable <HI>Edward Earl of Clarendon, George</HI> Duke of <HI>Albemarl, William</HI> Earl of <HI>Craven, John</HI> Lord <HI>Berkely, Anthony</HI> Lord <HI>Ashly,</HI> now Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> Sir <HI>George Carteret,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Col∣leton,</HI> Knights and Baronets, Sir <HI>William Berkely</HI> Knight, by which Letters Patents the Laws of <HI>Eagland</HI> are to be of force in <HI>Carolina:</HI> but the <HI>Lords Proprietors</HI> have power with the consent of the Inhabitants to make By-Laws for the better Government of the said <HI>Pro∣vince:</HI> So that no Money can be raised or Law made, without the consent of the Inhabitants or their Repre∣sentatives. They have also power to appoint and im∣power Governours, and other Magistrates to Grant Liberty of Conscience, make Constitutions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> With many other great Ptiviledges, as by the said Letters Patents will more largely appear. And the said Lords Proprietors have there setled a Constitution of Go∣vernment, whereby is granted Liberty of Conscience, and wherein all possible care is taken for the e∣qual Administration of Justice, and for the lasting Security of the Inhabitants both in their Persons and Estates.</P>
<P>By the care and endeavours of the said Lords Pro∣prietors, and at their very great charge, two Colonies have been setled in this <HI>Province,</HI> the one at <HI>Albemarle</HI> in the most Northerly part, the other at <HI>Ashly</HI> River, which is in the Latitude of thirty two Degrees od Mi∣nutes.</P>
<P><HI>Albemarle</HI> bordering upon <HI>Virginia,</HI> and only ex∣ceeding it in Health, Fertility, and Mildness of the Winter, is in the Growths, Productions, and other things much of the same nature with it: Wherefore I shall not trouble the Reader with a particular De∣scription of that part; but apply my self principally to discourse of the Colony at <HI>Ashly-River,</HI> which being many Degrees more Southward than <HI>Virginia,</HI> differs
<PB N="139" REF="73"/>
much from it in the Nature of its Climate and Pro∣ductions.</P>
<P><HI>Ashly-River</HI> was first setled in <HI>April</HI> 1670. the Lords Proprietors having at their sole charge, set out three Vessels, with a considerable number of able Men, eighteen Moneths Victuals, with Clothes, Tools, Am∣munition, and what else was thought necessary for a new Settlement, and continued at this charge to sup∣ply the Colony for divers years after, until the Inha∣bitants were able by their own Industry to live of themselves; in which condition they have been for divers years past, and are arrived to a very great De∣gree of Plenty of all sorts of Provisions. Insomuch, that most sorts are already cheaper there, than in any other of the English Colonys, and they are plentifully enough supplied with all things from <HI>England</HI> or other Parts. <HI>Ashly-River,</HI> about seven Miles in from the Sea, divides it self into two Branches; the Southermost retaining the name of <HI>Ashly-River,</HI> the North Branch is called <HI>Cooper-River.</HI> In <HI>May,</HI> 1680. the Lords Pro∣prietors sent their Orders to the Government their, ap∣pointing the Port-Town for these two Rivers to be Built on the Point of Land that divides them, and to be called <HI>Charles</HI> Town, since which time about an hundred Houses are there Built, and more are Build∣ing daily by the Persons of all sorts that come there to Inhabit, from the more Northern English Colonys, and the Sugar Islands, <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> and many Persons who went to <HI>Carolina</HI> Servants, being Indus∣trious, since they came out of their times with their Masters, at whose charge they were Transported, have gotten good Stocks of Cattle, and Servants of their own; have here also Built Houses, and exercise their Trades: And many that went thither in that condition, are now worth several Hundreds of Pounds, and live in a very plentiful condition, and their Esta∣tes still encreasing. And Land is become of that value near the Town, that it is sold for twenty Shillings <HI>per</HI> Acre, though pillaged of all its valuable Timber, and
<PB N="140" REF="74"/>
not cleared of the rest, and Land that is clear'd and fitted for Planting, and Fenced, is let for ten Shillings <HI>per annum</HI> the Acre, though twenty miles distant from the Town, and six men will in six weeks time, Fall, Clear, Fence in, and fit for Planting, six Acres of Land. At this Town in <HI>November,</HI> 1680. There Rode at one time sixteen Sail of Vessels (some of which were upwards of 200 Tuns) that came from divers parts of the Kings Dominions to trade there, which great concourse of shipping, will undoubtebly in a short time make it a considerable Town.</P>
<P>The <HI>Eastern Shore of America,</HI> whether it be by reason of its having the great Body of the Conti∣nent to the Westward of it, and by consequence the Northwest-Wind (which blows contrary to the Sun) the Freezing-Wind, as the North-East is in <HI>Europe,</HI> or that the Frozen Lakes which lie-in, be¦yond <HI>Canada,</HI> and lie <HI>North</HI> and <HI>West</HI> from the Shore, Impregnate the Freezing Wind with more chill and congealing qualities, or that the uncultivated Earth, covered for the most part with large shading Trees, breathes forth more nitrous Vapours, than that which is cultivated; or all these Reasons together, it is certainly much more cold than any part of <HI>Europe,</HI> in the same Degree of Latitude, insomuch that <HI>New-England</HI> and those parts of <HI>America</HI> about the Latitude of thirty nine and forty, and more <HI>North,</HI> though above six hundred miles nearer the Sun than <HI>England;</HI> is notwithstanding many degrees colder in the <HI>Winter.</HI></P>
<P>The Author having been informed by those that say they have seen it, that in those Parts it Freezeth about six Inches thick in a Night, and great Navi∣gable Rivers are Frozen over in the same space of time; and the Country about <HI>Ashly-River,</HI> though within nine Degrees of the <HI>Tropick,</HI> hath seldom any Winter that doth not produce some Ice, though I cannot yet learn that any hath been seen on Rivers or Ponds, above a quarter of an Inch thick, which vanisheth as soon as the Sun is an hour or two high,
<PB N="141" REF="74"/>
and when the Wind is not at <HI>North-west,</HI> the Wea∣ther is very mild; So that the <HI>December</HI> and <HI>January</HI> of <HI>Ashly-River,</HI> I suppose to be of the same Tempe∣rature with the latter end of <HI>March,</HI> and beginning of <HI>April</HI> in <HI>England;</HI> this small Winter causeth a fall of the Leaf, and adapts the Countrey to the pro∣duction of all the Grains and Fruits of <HI>England,</HI> as well as those that require more Sun; insomuch, that at <HI>Ashly-River,</HI> the Apple, the Pear, the Plum, the Quince, Apricock, Peach, Medlar, Walnut, Mulber∣ry, and Chesnut, thrive very well in the same Gar∣den, together with the Orange, the Lemon, the O∣live, the Pomgranate, the Fig and Almond; nor is the Winter here cloudy, Overcast, or Foggy, but it hath been observed that from the twentieth of <HI>Au∣gust</HI> to the tenth of <HI>March,</HI> including all the Winter Months, there have been but eight overcast days, and though Rains fall pretty often in the Winter, it is most commonly in quick Showers, which when past, the Sun shines out clear again.</P>
<P>The Summer is not near so hot as in <HI>Virginia,</HI> or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e other Northern <HI>American English</HI> Colonies, which may hardly gain belief with those that have not considered the reason; which is its neerness to the <HI>Tropicks,</HI> which makes it in a greater measure than those ports more Northward partake of those Bree∣zes, which almost constantly rise about eight or nine of the Clock, within the <HI>Tropicks,</HI> and blow fresh from the <HI>East</HI> till about four in the Afternoon, and a little after the Sea-breeze dies away, there ri∣ses a North-wind, which blowing all night, keeps it fresh and cool. In short, I take <HI>Carolina</HI> to be much of the same nature with those delicious Countries about <HI>Aleppo, Antioch,</HI> and <HI>Smyrna:</HI> But hath the ad∣vantage of being under an equal <HI>English</HI> Govern∣ment.</P>
<P>Such, who in this Countrey have seated themselves near great Marshes, are subject to Agues, as those are who are so seated in <HI>England;</HI> But such who are

<PB N="144" REF="75"/>
<HI>Swan, wild Geese, Duck, Widgeon, Teal, Curlew, Snipe, Shell Drake,</HI> and a certain sort <HI>of black Duck</HI> that is ex∣cellent meat, and stayes there all the year. Neat Cattle thrive and increase here exceedingly, there being per∣ticular Planters that have already seven or eight hun∣dred head, and will in a few years in all probabi∣lity, have as many thousands, unless they sell some part; he Cattle are not subject to any Disease as yet per∣ceiv'd, and are fat all the Year long without any Fo∣ther; the little Winter they have not pinching them so as to be perceiv'd which is a great advantage, the Planters here have of the more Northern Plantations, who are all forc'd to give their Cattle Fother, and must spend a great part of their Summers Labour in providing three or four Months Fother for their Cat∣tle in the Winter, or else would have few of them a∣live in the Spring, which will keep them from ever having very great Herds, or be able to do much in Planting any Commodity for Foreign Markets: the providing Winter Food for their Cattle, taking up so much of their Summers Labour; So that many Judi∣cious Persons think that <HI>Carolina</HI> will be able by Sea, to supply those Northern Colonies, with salted Beef for their Shipping, cheaper than they themselves with what is bred among them; for, considering that all the Woods in <HI>Carolina</HI> afford good Pasturage, and the small <HI>Rent</HI> that is paid to the <HI>Lords Proprietors</HI> for Land, an Ox is raised at almost as little expence in <HI>Carolina,</HI> as a Hen is in <HI>England.</HI> And it hath by experience been found that Beef will take salt at <HI>Ashly-River</HI> any Month in the Year, and save very well.</P>
<P>Ewes have most commonly two or three Lambs at a time; their Wool is a good Staple, and they thrive very well, but require a Shepherd to drive them to Feed, and to bring them home at night to preserve them from the Wolves. Hogs increase in <HI>Carolina</HI> abundantly, and in a manner without any charge or trouble to the Planter, only to make them Sheds, wherein they may be protected from the Sun and
<PB N="145" REF="75"/>
Rain, and Morning and Evening to give them a l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t∣tle Indian Corn, or the pickings and parings of <HI>Po∣tatoes, Turnips,</HI> or other Roots, and at the same time blowing a Horn, or making any other constant noise to which being us'd, they will afterwards upon hear∣ing it, repair home, the rest of their Food they get in the Woods, of Masts, and Nuts of several sorts; and when those fail, they have Grass and Roots enough, the ground being never frozen so hard as to keep them from Rooting, these conveniencies breeds them large, and in the Mast time they are very fat, all which makes the rearing them so easy, that there are many Plan∣ters that are single and have never a Servant, that have two or three hundred Hogs, of which they make great profit; <HI>Barbados, Jamaica,</HI> and <HI>New-England,</HI> af∣fording a constant good price for their Pork; by which means they get wherewithal to build them more convenient Houses, and to purchase Servants, and <HI>Ne∣gro-Slaves.</HI></P>
<P>There have been imported into <HI>Carolina,</HI> about an hundred and fifty Mares, and some Horses from <HI>New-York,</HI> and <HI>Road-Island,</HI> which breed well, and the Colts they have are finer Limb'd and Headed than their Dams or Sires, which gives great hopes of an excellent breed of Horses, as soon as they gotten have good Stalions amongst them. <HI>Negros</HI> by reason of the mildness of the Winter thrive and stand much better, than in any of the Nor∣thern Colonys, and require less clothes, which is a great charged sav'd.</P>
<P>With the <HI>Indiaas</HI> the <HI>English</HI> have a perfect friend∣ship, they being both useful to one another. And care is taken by the <HI>Lords Proprietors,</HI> that no Injustice shall be done them; In order to which they have established a particular Court of Judicature, (compos'd of the soberest and most disinteressed Inhabitants) to determine all differences that shall happen between the <HI>English</HI> and any of the <HI>Indians,</HI> this they do upon a Christian and Moral Consideration, and not out of any apprehension of danger from them, for the <HI>Indians</HI> have
<PB N="146" REF="76"/>
been always so ingaged in Wars one Town <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Village against another, (their Government being usually of no greater extent) that they have not suffered any in∣crease of People, there having been several Nations in a manner quite extirpated by Wars amongst them∣selves since the <HI>English</HI> setled at <HI>Ashly</HI> River: This keeps them so thin of people, and so divided, that the <HI>English</HI> have not the least apprehensions of danger from them; the <HI>English</HI> being already too strong for all the <HI>Indians</HI> within five hundred Miles of them, if they were united, and this the <HI>Indians</HI> so wel know, that they will never dare to break with the <HI>English,</HI> or do an Injury to any particular person, for fear of having it reveng'd upon their whole Nation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lords Proprietors</HI> do at present grant to all persons that come there to Inhabit as follows, <HI>viz.</HI> To each Mast∣er or Mistress of a Family fifty acres, &amp; for every able son or man-servant they shall carry or cause to be tran∣sported into <HI>Carolina</HI> fifty acres more, and the like for each Daughter or Woman servant that is marriageable, and for each child, man or woman servant under six∣teen yeart of age, forty acres, and fifty acres of Land to each servant when out of their time, this Land to be injoy'd by them and their Heirs for ever, they paying a penny an Acre Quit-rent to the Lords Proprietors, the Rent to commence in two years after their taking up their Land. But forasmuch as divers persons who are al∣ready Inhabitants of <HI>Carolina,</HI> &amp; others that have Intenti∣ons to transport themselves into that <HI>Province,</HI> desire not to be cumber'd with paying of a Rent, &amp; also to se∣cure to themselves good large convenient tracts of Land without being forc'd to bring thither a great number of servants at one time; The <HI>Lords Proprietors</HI> have been Prevail'd upon, and have agreed to sell to those who have a mind to buy Land, after the rate of fifty pound for a Thousand Acres, reserving a Pepper-Corn <HI>per annum</HI> Rent when demanded. The way of any ones tak∣ing up his Land, due to him either by carrying himself or servants into the Country, or by purchasing it of
<PB N="147" REF="76"/>
the <HI>Lords Proprietors,</HI> is after this manner: He first seeks out a place to his mind that is not already possessed by any other, then applyes himself to the Governour and Proprietors Deputies, and shew what rights he hath to Land, either by Purchase or otherwise, who thereupon issue out their Warrant to the Surveyor-General to measure him out a Plantation containing the number of actres due to him; who making cer∣tificate that he hath measur'd out so much Land and the Bounds, a Deed is prepar'd of course, which is Sign∣ed by the Governour and the Lords Proprietors De¦puties, and the Proprietors Seal affixed to it and Registr'd, which is a good Conveyance in Law of the Land therein mention'd to the Party and his Heirs for ever.</P>
<P>I have here, as I take it, described a pleasant and fertile Country, abounding in health and pleasure, and with all things necessary for the sustenance of man∣kind, and wherein I think I have written nothing but truth, sure I am I have inserted no wilful falshood: I have also told you, how men are to have Land that go there to Inhabit. But a rational man will certainly inquire, When I have Land, what shall I doe with it? what Commoditys shall I be able to produce that will yield me mony in other Countrys, that I may be ina∣bled to buy <HI>Negro</HI> slaves (without which a Planter can never do any great matter) and purchase other things for my pleasure and convenience, that <HI>Carolina</HI> doth not produce? To this I answer, That besides the great profit that will be made by the vast Herds of Cattle and Swine, the Country appears to be proper for the Commoditys following. <HI>viz. Wine.</HI> There are growing naturally in the Country five sorts of Gra∣pes, three of which the French Vignaroons, who are there, judge will make very good Wine, and some of the <HI>Lords Proprietors</HI> have taken care to send plants of the <HI>Rhenish, Canary, Claret, Muscat, Madera,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish <HI>Grapes,</HI> of all which divers Vinyards are plan∣ted; some wine was made this year that proved very
<PB N="148" REF="77"/>
good both in colour and taste, and an indifferent good quantity may be expected the next year: The Coun∣try hath gentle rising hills of fertil sand proper for Vines, and farther from the Sea, rock and gravel on which very good grapes grow naturally, ripen well, and toge∣ther, and very lushious in taste, insomuch as the French Protestants who are there, and skill'd in wine, do no way doubt of producing great quantitys and very good. <HI>Oyl.</HI> There are several <HI>Olive</HI> trees growing, which were carryed thither, some from <HI>Portugal,</HI> and same from <HI>Bermudas</HI> and flourish exceedingly, and the Inhabitants take great care to propagate more, so that in all probability it will be an excellent Oyl Country.</P>
<P><HI>Silk.</HI> There is in <HI>Carolina</HI> great plenty of <HI>Mulberry</HI> Trees, such as are by experience found to feed the Silkworm very well, yea as well as the white Mulberry, but there is of that sort also, which are propagated with a great deal of ease, a stick new-cut and thrust into the ground, seldom failing to grow, and so like∣wise if the Seed of them be sown. <HI>Tobacco</HI> doth here grow very well, and is nearer to the nature of the <HI>Spanish Tobacco</HI> than that of <HI>Virginia. Indigo</HI> thrives well here, and very good hath been made. <HI>Cotten</HI> of the <HI>Cyprus</HI> and <HI>Smyrna</HI> sort will grow well, and good plen∣ty of the Seed is sent thither. <HI>Flax and Hemp</HI> thrive exceedly. Good plenty of Pitch and Tar is there made, there being particular persons that have made above a thousand barrels. Here is great plenty of Oake for Pipe-staves, which are a good Commodity in the <HI>Maderas, Canaryes, Barbados,</HI> and the <HI>Leeward Islands. Sumack. Sumack</HI> growes in great abundance naturally, so undoubtedly would <HI>Woad, Madder</HI> and <HI>Sa-Flower,</HI> if planted. <HI>Drugs. Jallop, Sassaparilla, Turmerick, Sassafras, Snake-root,</HI> and divers others.</P>
<P>In short. This Country being of the same Climate and Temperature of <HI>Aleppo, Smyrna, Antioch, Judea,</HI> and the Province of <HI>Nanking,</HI> the richest in <HI>China,</HI> will (I conceive) produce any thing which those Countrys do, were the Seeds brought into it. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="149" REF="77"/>
Tools that men who goe thither ought to take with them are these, <HI>viz.</HI> An Ax, a Bill, and a broad Hoe, and grabbing Hoe, for every man, and a cross cut Saw to every four men, a Whip saw, a set of Wedges and Fraus and Betle-Rings to every family, and some Reaping Hooks and Sythes, as likewise Nails of all sorts, Hooks, Hinges, Bolts and Locks for their Houses. The Merchandizes which sell best in <HI>Carolina,</HI> are Linnen and Wollen, and all other Stuffs to make clothes of, with Thread, Sowing Silk, Buttons, Ribbons, Hats, Stockings, Shoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which they sell at very good rates, and for these goods any man may purchase the Provision he hath need of. The Passage of a man or women to <HI>Carolina</HI> is five Pound. Ships are going thi∣ther all times of the year.</P>
<P>Mr <HI>I. L.</HI> an <HI>Englishman,</HI> having about fourteen year since travelled into the western parts of <HI>Carolina,</HI> has given a very ingenious relation of his Discoverys; Has says the <HI>Indians</HI> now seated in these parts are none of those which the <HI>English</HI> removed from <HI>Virginia,</HI> but e people driven by an Enemy from the North-west, and invited to sit down here by an Oracle above four hun∣dred years ago as they pretend; For the ancient In∣habitants of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Carolina</HI> were far more rude and barbarous, feeding only upon raw flesh and Fish till these taught them to plant Corn, and shewed them the use of it. They have no Letters, yet supply that defect either by Counters, Emblems or Hieroglyphicks, or else by Tradition delivered in long Tales from Fa∣ther to Son, which when children they are taught to say by rote; where a battel has been fought they raise a small Pyramid of stones consisting of the number of the slain and Prisoners taken; By the picture of a <HI>Stag</HI> they express <HI>Swiftness;</HI> By a <HI>Serpent, wrath;</HI> By a <HI>Lion, Courage;</HI> By a <HI>Dog, Faithfulness;</HI> By a <HI>Swan</HI> they signify the <HI>English,</HI> alluding to their white Com∣plexion, and flight over the Sea; They worship one God the Creator of all things whom they call <HI>Okee,</HI> and to whom the High Priest offers Sacrifice, yet they

believe he has no care of worldly affairs, but commits the Government of Mankind to good and Evil Spirits, to whom the Inferior Priests pay their Devotion and Sa∣crifice, at which in a lamentable Tune they recite the great things done by their Ancestors. They religious∣ly observe Marriage, and distinguish themselves into four Tribes, believing that all mankind were derived from four women, whereupon they divide their places of Buriall into four Quarters, assigning one to every Tribe, for they hold it wicked and ominous to mingle their bodys even when dead; they commonly wrap up the Corps in the skins of Beasts and bury provision and householdstuff for its use in the other world; when their Great men die they kill some Prisoners of War to attend them, they believe the Transmigration of Souls, for the <HI>Angry</HI> they say are possest with the Spirit of a <HI>Serpent;</HI> the <HI>Bloudy,</HI> that of a <HI>Wolf;</HI> the <HI>Fearful,</HI> of a <HI>Deer;</HI> and the <HI>Faithful</HI> of a <HI>Dog,</HI> The Residue of their lesser Gods they place beyond the Mountains and the <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean, and though they want those helps of Education which we have, yet in solemn debates they will deliver themselves with excellent Judgment and Eloquence.</P>
<P>This Author relates that in his Travels with some <HI>In∣dians,</HI> they met with a Rattlesnake, in length two yards and an half and as big as a mans arm, which by the greatness of her Belly they judged to be full with young, but having killed and opened her, found there a small Squirrel whole; The <HI>Indians</HI> assured him that these Serpents lying under a Tree fix their Eyes sted∣fastly upon the Squirrel, which so affrights the little Beast that he tumbles into the Jaws of his Enemy; Travelling through the Woods a Deer seized by a wild-Cat crossed their way, being almost spent with the burden and cruelty of her Rider, who having fastned on her Shoulder left not sucking her Blood till she fell down under him; which an <HI>Indian</HI> perceiving, shot a lucky Arrow which peircing the wild Cat under the Belly made him leave his prey already slain, and turn

toward them with a dreadful fierce look, but his strength and Spirits failing, they escaped his revenge which they had certainly felt had not his wound been mortal. This Creature is somewhat bigger than our <HI>En∣glish</HI> Fox, of a reddish grey Colour, and in figure eve∣ry way like an ordinary Cat, fierce, ravenous and cun∣ning, for knowing the Deer, (upon which they chiefly prey) too swift for them, they watch upon Branches of Trees, and as they walk or feed under, jump down upon them; The Fur is counted excellent, and the Flesh eaten by the <HI>Indians,</HI> though as rank as a Dogs. They saw great Herds of Red and Fallow Deer daily feeding, and on the sides of the Hills Bears crashing Masts like Swine; Small Leopards they saw, but never any Lions, though their Skins are much worn by the <HI>Indians;</HI> The Wolves were so ravenous, that they often feared their Horses would have been devoured, in the night they gathered up and howled so close about them, if the Fires they made had not scar'd them away; The Woods were full of Bever, O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter and grey Foxes; They then arrived to the <HI>Apalatean</HI> Mountains, which were so high and steep that they were from break of Day till Evening, ere they could gain the top from whence next Morning they had a beautiful Prospect of the <HI>At∣lantick</HI> Ocean washing the <HI>Virginian</HI> Shores, but to the North and West other higher Mountains hindred their sight: Here they wandred in Snow three or four days hoping to find some passage through the Moun∣tains, but the coldness of the Earth and Air seizing their hands and feet, caused their return and put a stop to their further Travels.</P>
<P>In a second Expedition, he came to another sort of <HI>Indians,</HI> enemies to the Christians, yet ventured among them because they hurt none whom they do not fear, and after he had given them some sin all Trifles of Glass and Metal they were very kind to him, and con∣sulted with their Gods, whether to admit him into their Nation and Councils, and oblige him to stay a∣mong them by a Marriage with their Kings or some
<PB N="152" REF="79"/>
of their great Mens daughters, but he with much ado waved their courtesies and got leave to depart upon promise to return in six Months. At length he came to a Town more populous than any he had seen before in his Journey; The King whereof though his Domi∣nions are large and populous is in continual fear of his Neighbour <HI>Indians,</HI> who are a People so addicted to Arms that even their Women come into the Field, and shoot Arrows over their Husbands Shoulders. The men it seems fight with Silver hatchets, for an <HI>Indian</HI> told him, they were of the same metal with the hilt of his Sword. They are a cruel Nation and steal their Neigh∣bours Children to sacrifice them to their Idols: The Women delight much in Ornaments of Feathers of which they have great Variety, but Peacocks are most in esteem because not common in that Countrey; They are reasonably handsom and more civil in their Carriage than their Neighbours, but miserably infa∣tuated with the Illusions of the Devil, it caused no small horror in him to see one of them, with his neck all one side, foam at the mouth, stand barefoot upon burnings Coals for neer an hour, and then, recovering his senses, leap out of the fire without hurt or s gn of any; this he was an Eye witness of. Southwest from hence he arrived at a Nation who differ in Govern∣ment from all the other <HI>Indians</HI> of these parts, being slaves rather than Subjects to their King; their Monarch was a grave man, and courteous to Strangers, yet our Authour could not without horror observe his Barba∣rous Superstition, in hiring 3 Youths to kill as many young Women of their Enemies, as they could meet withal to serve his Son, then newly dead in the other World as he vainly imagined. These youths during his stay returned with Skins torn off the Heads and Faces of three young Girls which they presented to their King and were by him gratefully received. Our Au∣thor in his sleep was stung by a Mountain Spider, and had not an <HI>Indian</HI> suckt out the Poyson he had died for receiving the hurt at the rip of one of his Fingers,

The <HI>Indian</HI> having thus suckt half a score times and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pit as often, our Author was eased of all his pain and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>refectly recovered. He thought he had been bit with a Rattle-Snake for he did not see who hurt him, but the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndian</HI> found by the wound and the effects of it, that it was given by a Spider, one of which he saw the next <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay much like our great blue Spider, only somewhat lon∣ger; It is probable the nature of this Poyson is much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke that of the <HI>Tarantula;</HI> being thus beyond hope and expectation, restored to himself, he with his fellow tra∣vellers resolved to return back to <HI>Carolina</HI> without mak∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng any further discovery.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> A Prospect of <HI>Bermudas,</HI> or the Sum∣mer Islands, with the Discovery, Plantation, and Product thereof.</HEAD>
<P>Having travelled thus long upon the Main Land of <HI>America,</HI> let us now venture again to Sea, and look into the Islands belonging to his Majesty in the <HI>West Indies.</HI> The first which offers it self is <HI>Bermudas</HI> or the Summer Islands, which are a multitude of broken Isles, some write no less than four hundred, scituate directly East from <HI>Virginia</HI> from which they are dis∣tant
<PB N="154" REF="80"/>
five hundred <HI>English</HI> Miles, and three Thousand three hundred Miles from the City of <HI>London,</HI> so named from <HI>John Bermudaz</HI> a <HI>Spaniard</HI> who first discovered them. <HI>Oviedo</HI> writes, that he was near it, and had though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to have sent some Hogs on Shore for increase, but by force of Tempest was driven from thence, it being extreamly subject to furious Rains, Lightning and Thunder, for which and the many Shipwracks tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have hapned upon the Coast, it is called the <HI>Island of Devils. Job Hartop</HI> relates that in the height of <HI>Ber∣mudas,</HI> they had sight of a Sea-Monster, which shewed it self three times from the middle upward, in shap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> like a man of an <HI>Indian</HI> or Mulatto Complexion; I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was after named the <HI>Summer Islands</HI> from the shipwrack of Sr <HI>George Summers</HI> who was so much delighted with the misadventure, that he endeavoured what he could to settle a Plantation there, together with Sr <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gates.</HI> They found there plenty and Variety of Fish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> abundance of Hogs which probably escaped out of some shipwrack; Mulberries, Silkworms, Palmettos Cedars, Pearls and Ambergreice, but the most sur∣prizing thing was the Variety of Fowl, taking a Thousand of one kind in two or three hours as big as a Pigeon laying speckled Eggs as large as hens on the Sand, which they do dayly without affright though men sit down by them; Other Birds were so tame that by whistling to them they would come and gaze at you, while with your stick you might kill them; when they had taken a Thousand soon after they might have as many more; They had other Eggs of Tortoises, a bushell being found in the belly of one of them which were very sweet and good, they took fourty of these Turtles or Tortoises in a day, one of which would serve fifty men at a meal.</P>
<P>This shipwrackt Company built here a ship and a Pinnace, two of their Company being Married, and two born among them, whereby they took the most natural possession thereof for our Nation. These I∣slands seem rent asunder with Tempests which threa∣ten in appearance to swallow them all in time, the

The North and North-West Winds cause Winter in <HI>December, January,</HI> and <HI>February.</HI> Yet not so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evere, but young Birds are then seen. That Island of most fame and greatness than all the rest, and to which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he name of <HI>Bermuda's</HI> is most properly ascribed is sci∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uated in the Latitude of thirty two degrees and thirty Minuts North; the Air is sound and healthy very agree∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble to <HI>English</HI> Bodies, the Soil as Fertile as any, well Watered, plentiful in Maize, of which they have two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arvests yearly, that which is sowed in <HI>March</HI> being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut in <HI>July,</HI> and what is sowed in <HI>August</HI> is mowed in <HI>December.</HI> No venemous Creature is to be found in this Country, nor will live if brought thither, and be∣sides these advantages, it is so fenced about with Rocks, and Islets that without knowledge of the Passages a Boat of Ten Tun can not be brought into the Haven, yet with such knowledg there is entrance for the great∣est Ships. The <HI>English</HI> have since added to these natu∣ral strenghts such Artificial helps, by Block-houses, Forts and Bulwarks in convenient places, as may give it the Title of Impregnable.</P>
<P>It was first discovered rather accidentally than upon design by <HI>John Bermudaz</HI> a <HI>Spaniard</HI> about 1522, and thereupon a Proposition made in the Council of <HI>Spain</HI> for setling a Plantation therein, as a place very conve∣nient for the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet in their return from the Bay of <HI>Mexico</HI> by the streights of <HI>Bahama;</HI> yet was it neglected, and without any Inhabitant till the like ac∣cidental coming of Sr. <HI>George Summers</HI> sent to <HI>Virginia</HI> with some Companies of the <HI>English</HI> by the Lord <HI>De la Ware</HI> in 1609. Who being Shipwrackt on this Coast had the opportunity to survey the Island which he so well liked, that he endeavoured to settle a Plantation in it at his return in 1612. The First Colony was sent over under <HI>Richard More,</HI> who in three years erected eight or ninth Forts in convenient places, which he
<PB N="156" REF="81"/>
planted with Ordnance. In 1616. a new Supply was sent over under Captain <HI>Tucker,</HI> who applied them∣selves to sowing of Corn, setting of Trees brought thi∣ther from other parts of <HI>America,</HI> and planting that gainful Weed Tobacco. In 1619. the business was taken more to heart, and made a publick matter, many great Lords and Persons of honour being interested in it; Captain <HI>Butler</HI> was sent thither with 500 Men. The Isle was divided into Tribes or Counties, a Bor∣rough belonging to each Tribe, and the whole reduced to a settle Government both in Church and State according to the Laws of <HI>England.</HI> After this, all suc∣ceeded so well, that in 1623. there were said to be 3000 <HI>English,</HI> and ten Forts, whereon were planted fif∣ty pieces of Ordnance, their Numbers since increasing dayly both by Children born within the Island, and supplies from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>All the Isles together represent an Half-Moon, and inclose very good Ports, as the <HI>Great Sound, Harring∣ton Inlet, Southampton</HI> and <HI>Pagets</HI> Bay, with <HI>Dover</HI> and <HI>Warwick</HI> Forts, having their Names from the Noble Men who were undertakers therein; The greatest Isle is called St. <HI>George,</HI> five or six Leagues long, and al∣most throughout not above a quarter or half a League long. The Air is almost constantly clear, (except when it Thunders and Lightens) is extream tempe∣rate and healthful, few dying of any Disease but Age; so that many have removed on purpose from <HI>England</HI> hither, only to enjoy a long and healthful Life, and after having continued there are fearful of removing out of so pure an Air; the very Spiders here are not venemous, but of divers curious Colour, and make their Webs so strong, that oftimes small Birds are intangled and caught therein; Their Cedar Trees are different from all others, and the Wood very sweet; But the excellencies of this curious place are sufficient∣ly exprest by our <HI>English Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gil</HI> in the following Poem, wherewith I shall conclude this Prospect of <HI>Bermuda</HI>'s, the present Governour whereof for his Majesty, is Sir <HI>Henry Heydon.</HI></P>

They go stark naked both Men and Women, as many other Nations do, and if any among them should endeavour to hide their Privy Parts, all the rest would laugh at it: Yea though the Christians have conversed very much a∣mong them, yet have all their persuasions to cover themselves been to no purpose, and though when they come to visit the <HI>Europeans,</HI> or treat with them, they have so far complied as to cover themselves by putting on a Shirt, Drawers, Hat, or such Cloths as have been given them, yet assoon as they are returned to their own Habitations they strip themselves, and put up all in their Closets, till some such occasion shall happen a∣gain; To requite which compliance, some of the <HI>French</HI> having occasion to go among them, make no difficulty to strip themselves after their example, and this defi∣ance of Clothes is well known to Reign in all places un∣der the Torrid Zone, and being reproached for it, they reply, <HI>That we came naked into the World, and it wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a mad thing to hide the Bodies given us by Nature.</HI></P>

<PB N="161" REF="83"/>
every morning at some River or Spring near hand, they return to their Houses, and dry themselves by a little Fire, after which one takes a red Composition, which being mixt with Oil, they rub therewith the whole Bo∣dy and Face, and to appear more gallant, they many times make black circles about their Eyes with the Juice of <HI>Junipa</HI> Apples, this painting they reckon useful both for Ornament, and to increase their Strength and Ac∣tivity, securing them likewise against the coldness of the nigths and rain, the stinging of Mesquito's, and the heat of the Sun, and serves instead of Shirts, Cloaks, and Coats; Sometimes to add to their gallan∣try they wear a Crown of Feathers of different colours, and hang the Bones of certain Fishes, and of late buck∣les of Gold, Silver and Tin in their Ears, but are most taken with those of Chrystal, Amber, or Coral: some of them make holes through their lips, yea in the space between their Nostrils wherein they hang a Ring, Fish∣bone or some such toy; They weare also Necklaces and Bracelets of Amber, Coral, or such glittering stuff.</P>
<P>There are excellent Fruits growing in these Islands, as Oranges, Pomegranates, Citrons, Rasins, <HI>Indian</HI> Figs. and Coco's, that famous Fruit whereof Histori∣ans tell such Miracles; It grows on the very trunck or top of the Tree in form of a Nut, but much bigger, one of them sometimes weighing above ten Pound; from the first bearing this Tree is never found without Fruit, for it bears new every Month; When the Coco Nut is opened, the Meat is white as Snow, extreamly nourishing, and tasts like an Almond, enough to fill an ordinary Dish, in the midst of it there is a Glass full of Liquor clear and pleasant as perfumed Wine; There are also excellent Trees and Wood, as <HI>Brasi, Ebony, Iron</HI> and <HI>yellow</HI> Wood: Likewise <HI>Cassia, Cinal∣mon</HI> and <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ton</HI> Trees, with <HI>Pepper, Tobacco, Iu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igo, Ginger Potatoes, Pine-apples</HI> and <HI>Sugar Canes,</HI> and a Living or Sensible Plant esteemed one of the most ad∣mirable Rarities in the World, which as soon as one fastens on it with his hand, draws backs its leaves

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIII.</HI> A Prospect of the Island of <HI>Anguil∣la</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>ANguilla,</HI> sometimes called <HI>Snake</HI> Island from its Shape, is a long Tract of Land of about Thirty mile, and nine mile broad, winding almost about neer, St. <HI>Martins</HI> Island, whence it is very plainly perceived; There is not any Mountain in it, the ground lying low and even; Where it is broadest there is a Pond, about which some <HI>English</HI> have setled themselves in number two or three hundred, and where they plant Tobac∣co, which is highly esteemed by those who are good Judges in that Commodity. The Island lyes in Eigh∣teen Degrees and Twenty Minutes on this side the E∣quinoctial. Before the discovery of <HI>America,</HI> there were not to be found in these parts any Horses, Kine, Oxen, Sheep, Goats, Swine, or Dogs, but for the bet∣ter conveniency of their Navigations and supply of their Ships in case of necessity they left some of these Creatures in several parts of this <HI>New-found World,</HI> where they have since multiplyed so exceedingly, that now they are more common, as well on the Continent as the <HI>Caribees,</HI> than in any part of <HI>Eu∣rope</HI></P>
<P>But beside these Foreign kinds of Cattle, there were before in these Islands certain sorts of strange fourfoot∣ed Beasts, as the <HI>Opassum</HI> about the bigness of a Cat with a Sharp Snout, the neither Jaw being shorter than the upper like a Pigs, it hath very sharp Claws, and climbs Trees easily, feeding upon Birds, and in want thereof upon fruit, it is Remarkable for a purse or bag of its own Skin folded together under its belly,
<PB N="164" REF="85"/>
wherein it carries its young, which it lays upon the ground at pleasure by opening that natural purse, when he would leave that place he opens it again, and the young ones get in, and so he carries them with him wherever he goes. The female suckles them without setting them on the ground, for her Teats lye within that Purse, which is much softer within that without; The Female commonly brings six young ones, but the Male who hath such another natural Purse un∣der his Belly, carries them in his turn to ease the Fe∣male.</P>
<P>There are also in some of these Islands a kind of Wild Swine, with Short Ears, almost no Tails, and their Navels on their backs, some of them are all black, others have certain white Spots, their strange grunting is more hideous than that of Swine, they are called <HI>Ja∣varis;</HI> The flesh is of tast good enough, but very hardly taken, in regard the Bore having a kind of vent or hole on the back, by which he refreshes his Lungs, is in a manner unwearied, and if he be forced to stop, and be persued by the Dogs, he is armed with such Sharp and cutting Tushes, that he tears to pieces all who set upon him. The <HI>Tatous</HI> is another strange creature, armed with a hard scaly coat wherewith they cover and secure themselves as with Armour: They have a head and snout like a Pig, wherewith they turn up the ground, they have also in every Paw five very sharp Claws, which they use more readily to thrust away the Earth and discover the Roots, wherewith they are fat∣tened in the night time. Some affirm their flesh is very delicate meat, and that there is a small bone in their Tails which helps deafness: It is known to be good for noise and pains in the ears, some of these are as big as Foxes; when they are persued, or sleep, which is commonly in the day time, they close together like a Bowl, and so dexterously get in their feet head, and ears under their hard scales, that all the parts of their Body are by that natural Armour secured against all the attempts of Huntsmen or Dogs, and if

they are neer some precipice or steep Hill they roll down without peril. The <HI>Agouty</HI> is another, of a dark colour and a little Tail without hair, it hath two teeth in the upper Jaw, and as many in the neather: It holds its meat in the Two fore Paws like a Squirrel, and crys as if it distinctly pronounced the word <HI>Covey;</HI> When it is hunted it gets into hollow Trees, out of which it is forced by smoak after it hath made a strange cry; If taken young it is easily tamed; When angry the hair of his back stands upright and he strikes on the ground with his hind feet like a Rabbit, being much of the same bigness, but his ears are short and round, and his Teeth as Sharp as a Razor. There are also <HI>Musk-Rats</HI> who live in holes and Berries like Rabbits, there comes from them a scent like Musk, which causes Melancholy and makes such a strong per∣fume about their holes that it is easy to find them out.</P>
<P>But of all, the <HI>Caymaa, Crocodile</HI> or Allegator is very remarkable it keeps neer the Sea and in Rivers and Islands uninhabited, and sometimes among the Reeds on Land, very hideous to look on. It is thought to live very long, and grows bigger to the very last day, even to eighteen foot long and as big about as an Hogs∣head, it hath four feet well armed with crooked Claws; The skin, which is covered all over with scales, is so hard on the back that a Bullet from a Musket shot at him shall hardly make any Impression on it, but if be hurt under the belly, or in the eyes he is soon gone; his lower Jaw is immoveable, but hath so wide a mouth, and so well set with sharp Teeth that he makes nothing to cut a man in two; He runs fast enough on the Land, but the weight of his body makes as deep a Track in the sand as a Coach-horse, and having no joints in the backbone, he goes streight forward, not being able to turn his vast body with∣out much difficulty, so that to avoid him one need only turn aside several times. Those that are bred in the fresh-water smell of Musk, while they are alive,
<PB N="166" REF="87"/>
and the Air is perfumed an hundred paces about them, nay the water retains somewhat of the smell, which is inclosed in certain Glandules under his Thighs, and being taken thence retain their scent long; It may be Providence hath bestowed it upon them, that men and other Creatures may avoid being made a Prey to these cruel Monsters.</P>
<P>Those that live in the Sea have no such smell, but both kinds are very dangerous to those that swim; They have a cunning slight for seizing Oxen and Cows, for one of them will lye lurking at the places where they come to Water, and finding one at his advan∣tage he half shuts his eyes, and floats on the top of the Water like a peice of rotten wood, and getting still nearer to the poor Beast which is drinking and un∣aware of him, he immediately fastens on him by the lips, forcing him under Water, drowning and then eating him. He likewise takes men by the same sleight, for <HI>Vincent Le Blanc</HI> relates, that the Servant of a Con∣sul of <HI>Alexandria</HI> going to take up one of these cruel Creatures, thinking it had been a peice of wood, was drawn by it to the bottom of the River, and never seen more. There are abundance of these Monstrous <HI>Crocodiles</HI> in these Islands who come in great numbers in the night to the places where the <HI>Tortoises</HI> are killed (of which hereafter) to feed on the entrails and carcass of them that are left by Fishermen; who are obliged to carry great wooden Leavers with them to keep off these <HI>Crocodiles,</HI> and oftimes kill them by first breaking their back therewith. Several parts of this Ravenous Monster are accounted good for many Diseases, the wise Author of Nature having provided some advant ges from those Creatures which are other∣wise most pernicious.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIV.</HI> A Prospect of the Island of <HI>Mont∣serrat.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Island of <HI>Montserrat</HI> received that Title of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from the resemblance of a Moun∣tain therein to that of <HI>Montserrat</HI> neer <HI>Barcelona</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> and hath retained the name ever since; It is of a small extent, not above three Leagues or nine Miles in length, and neer as much in bredth, so that it seems almost round. It lies in the Latitude of seventeen de∣grees on this side the Line, full of mountains whereon grow plenty of <HI>Cedar</HI> and other Trees: The Valleys and plains being very fertile. It is chiefly inhabited by the <HI>Irish,</HI> with some <HI>English,</HI> in all about six or seaven hundred persons; There is in it a very fair Church of a delightful structure, built by the contributions of the Governor and Inhabitants: The Pulpit, Seats, and all the Joyners and Carpenters work within it are of the most precious and sweet-scented wood growing in the Countrey.</P>
<P>On the Coasts of these Islands there is sometimes taken by the Fishers a Monster so dreadful that they call it the <HI>Sea-Devil</HI> about four foot long and propor∣tionably big, it hath on the back a great bunch full of Prickles like an Hedghog; The Skin thereof is hard, uneven and rugged like that of a Sea-dog and of a black colour, the head is flat and on the upper part hath many little risings, and among them two small very black eyes. The mouth is extream wide, with several very sharp Teeth, two of them crooked like a Wild Boars, it hath four Fins and a broad forked Tail; but has the name of <HI>Sea-Devil,</HI> because above the eyes there
<PB N="168" REF="88"/>
are two little sharp black Horns, which turn toward his back like a Rams; As this Monster is extream ugly, the Meat of it, which is soft and full of strings, is ab∣solute Poyson, causing strange Vomitings and Swoon∣ings, which prove mortal if not prevented by a good Dose of <HI>Mithridate</HI> or some other Antidote, this dange∣rous Creature is only desired by the curious to adorn their Closets, whereby it happens that this Devil who was never profitable while alive, gives a little satisfacti∣on to their Eyes after death.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sea Ʋnicorn</HI> is a Fish no less Miraculous, a Pro∣digious one, being cast ashore about these Islands, is thus described by an Ingenious occular Witness; This Unicorn, saith he, was pursuing a smaller Fish with such earnestness and impetuosity, that it stuck with half the body dry on a Sand-bank, and before it could recover the deep, was destroyed by the Inhabitants; It was about eighteen Foot long, and in compass as big as a Barrel, having six great Fins like the ends of Gal∣ley Oars, whereof two were placed near the Gills, and the other four at the sides of the Belly at equal distan∣ces, they were of a Vermillion red Colour; All the up∣per part of the Body was covered with great Scales a∣bout the bigness of a Crown peice, of a blew Colour, intermixt with Spangles of Silver, near the Neck the Scales were closer, and of a dark Colour like a Collar; The Scales under the Belly were yellow, the Tail Forked, the Head somewhat bigger than that of a Horse, and near the same shape; The lower part of the Body was covered with an hard dark Skin, and as, it is said, the <HI>Land Ʋnicorn</HI> hath one Horn in his Fore∣head, so this <HI>Sea Ʋnicorn</HI> had a very fair one issuing out of his Head about nine Foot and an half in length, it was very streight, and grew smaller to the very point, which was sharp enough to peirce Wood, Stone, or any thing more hard: Toward the Head it was sixteen Inches about, and from thence almost to the end wav∣ed like a wreathed Pillar, growing smaller till they gently ended in a point, it was naturally polished of a
<PB N="169" REF="88"/>
shining black, marked with certain small white and yellow strokes, and of such solidity, that a sharp File could hardly get a little small Powder from it. It had no Ears standing up, but two spacious Gills as the o∣ther Fishes. The Eyes are about the bigness of an Hens Egg, the Ball which was of a Skie Colour, Ena∣meld with yellow, was of Vermillion Colour, and be∣yond it another as clear as Chrystal; The Mouth was wide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ough, with several extream sharp Teeth; The Tongue proportionable, covered with a rough red Skin; Upon the Head was a Crown rising two Inches above the Skin, made Oval, and ending in a point. Above three hundred Persons eat of the Meat of it, and thought it exceeding delicate, being Inter-larded with white fat, and when Boiled, came up in Fleaks like fresh Cod, but of a more excellent tast; Those who saw it alive, and broke its back with Leavers, af∣firmed that he made prodigious attempts to thrust them with his Horn, using it with much nimbleness and dexterity, and if he had not wanted Water, would have been too hard for them all, within him they found the scales of several Fishes, a token that he lived by prey.</P>
<P>Of all the Sea-Monsters that are good to eat, and kept for Provision as Salmon and Cod are in <HI>Europe</HI> the most esteemed in these Islands is a certain Fish by the <HI>French</HI> called <HI>Lamantine</HI> and <HI>Manaty;</HI> It is a Monster that in time grows to that bulk that some of them are eighteen foot in length and seven in bigness, the head is like a Cow, and from thence termed by some the <HI>Sea-Cow,</HI> with small Eyes and a thick Skin of a dark colour wrinkled and hairy, which being dryed serves for a Buckler against the Arrows of the <HI>Indians.</HI> They have no Fins, but instead thereof two short feet under their Bellies, each of which hath four fingers, very weak to support the weight of so heavy a Body, nor hath he any other defensive weapons; It lives on the grass and Herbage about the Rocks, in those Shallow places that have not much above a fathom of Sea-Water. The
<PB N="170" REF="89"/>
Females are disburthened of their young like Cows; and have two Teats wherewith they suckle them, they bring forth two at a time, who forsake not the old one till they no longer need Milk, and can feed on Grass as she does. Of all Fish none are so good meat as this, two or three will load a great Canow, and eat short like a Land creature, of a Vermilion colour, not cloying or fulsom, and mixt with fat, which being mel∣ted never grows musty: It is much more wholsom sal∣ted a day or two than fresh; Certain small stones found in his head are highly valued for the Stone and Gra∣vel when dissolved to Powder.</P>
<P>There are often seen rising out of the Sea about these Islands great numbers of Fishes which fly fifteen or twenty foot above Water, and neer an hundred paces in Length, but no more in regard their Wings are dried by the Sun, they are somewhat like <HI>Herrings</HI> but of a rounder head and broader back, their wings like a Bats, which begin a little below the head, and reach almost to the Tail. In their flight they many times strike against the Sails of Ships, and fall even in the day time upon the Decks, some say they are very good meat; the cause of their flying is to a∣void danger from greater Fishes but they meet with Enemies in the Air as well as Water, for certain Sea-Fowl which live only by Prey have open hostility with them and seize them as they fly. The <HI>Sword-Fish</HI> is worth observing as well as the <HI>Flying-Fish,</HI> it hath at the end of the upper Jaw a defensive weapon about the bredth of a great broad Sword, which hath Sharp hard teeth on both sides, some of these Swords are five foot long, and six inches broad at the lower end with twenty seaven white solid teeth in each rank, and the bulk of their Bodies bears a proportion there∣to. The head of this Monster is flat and hideous to behold, being in the Shape of an Heart, neer their Eyes they have two Vents at which they cast out the Water which they have swallowed; They have no Scales but a greyish Skin on their back, and white
<PB N="171" REF="89"/>
under the belly which is rough like a file; They have seaven Fins, two of each side, two on the back, and and one which serves them for a Tail, some call them <HI>Saw-fishes,</HI> and some <HI>Emperors,</HI> because there is always open War between them and the Whale, which is many times wounded to death by this their dreadful weapon.</P>

<P>THe Island of <HI>Dominica</HI> lyes in the Latitude of fif∣teen degrees and thirty Minutes, judged to be in length about thirteen Leagues or forty Mile and not much less in breadth where it is greatest. On the West∣side of the Isle is a very convenient Harbour for Ships. It is very Mountainous in the midst which incompasses an inaccessible bottom, where from the tops of certain Rocks may be seen an infinite number of Vipers, Dra∣gons and other dreadful venemous Creatures, whom none dares approach unto. Yet there are many fruit∣ful valleys producing several commodities, but especi∣ably Tobacco which is planted by the <HI>English,</HI> but the Natives who are <HI>Cannibals</HI> and very barbarous do much hinder the coming of the <HI>English</HI> to settle there: For the <HI>Caribeans</HI> are very numerous in it, and have a long time entertained those who came to visit them with a story of a vast and monstrous Serpent which had its aboad in that bottom, affirming that there was on the head of it a very sparkling stone like a Carbun∣cle of inestimable price, and that it commonly covered this Rich Jewel with a thin moving Skin like that of a mans Eye-lid, but that when it went to drink or sport∣ed
<PB N="172" REF="90"/>
it self within the midst of that deep bottom he fully discovered it, and that the Rocks &amp; all about received a a wonderful lustre from the Fire issuing out of that pre∣cious Crown.</P>
<P>The Supream Person of this Island was heretofore one of the most considerable among those of the same Nation, for when all their forces marched out against the <HI>Arovagues</HI> their Common Enemies of the Continent, he had still the conduct of the Van-guard, and was known by a particular Mark which he had about him; When any <HI>French</HI> ships come neer this Island there are imme∣diately seen several Canows in each of which there are are three or four <HI>Indians</HI> at the most who come to di∣rect them to the Havens where they may safely An∣chor. They commonly bring along with them some of the Countrey fruits, whereof having presented the Cap∣tains and other Officers with the choicest, they offer the rest in exchange for Fishing hooks, graines of Chry∣stal and such trifles as they Account precious. They have had some differences with the <HI>English</HI> upon the account of damage received from some particular Per∣sons which though our nation hath protested against, yet their reveng is so implacable that they hardly ever forgive nor pass by any injuries; And upon this Account next the <HI>Arovages</HI> on the Continent of <HI>America</HI> the greatest enemies the <HI>Caeibbeans</HI> have are the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> which enmity took his rise from hence, that some ill principled <HI>Englishmen</HI> under the Flags of other Na∣tions having by pretended kindness, and little gifts and <HI>Aqua Vitae</HI> which they dearly love, got divers of the <HI>Car¦ribbeans</HI> aboard their Ships, when they saw their Vessel ful of these poor people who never dreamt of such Treachery, carried away men, Women and Children into their Plantations, were they are still kept slaves.</P>
<P>Hence it happens they bear such a grudg to the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> as hardly to endure to hear their Language, and if a <HI>Frenchman</HI> or some other Nation in Friendship with them chance to use any <HI>English</HI> expression he runs the hazard of their Enmity. In revenge hereof they oft
<PB N="173" REF="90"/>
make Incursions into <HI>Montserrat, Antego</HI> and other <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Settlements, firing their Houses, and carrying a way Goods, Men, Women, and Children with them, but do not eat them as they do the <HI>Arovagues.</HI> They do not love to be called <HI>Cannibals</HI> though they eat the Flesh of their Enemies, which they say they do to satisfy their Indignation and revenge, and not out of any delicacy they find in it more than in any thing else which they eat; In other things they are of a good tractable disposition, and so great enemies to severity that if the <HI>European</HI> or other Nati∣ons who have any of them slaves, treat them with ri∣gour, they dye out of pure grief. They commonly reproach the <HI>Europeans</HI> with their Avarice and im∣moderate industry in getting wealth for themselves and Children, since the Earth is able to find sufficient sustenance for all men, if they will take pains to culti∣vate it; As for themselves, they say they are not perplex∣ed with care for those things wherewith their lives are preserved, and it is apparent they are much fatter and healthier than those that fare deliciously; They live without Ambition, without vexation, without disquiet having no desire of acquiring Honours or Wealth, slighting Gold and Silver, and seeming astonished to see us so much esteem them considering we are so well furnished with Glass or Chrystall, which they think more beautiful and valuable. When they go a hunting, Fishing, or root up Trees for ground to make a little Garden, or to build Houses, which are innocent Imploy∣ments, and sutable to the nature of man, they do all without eagerness and as it were in a way of divertise∣ment and Recreation.</P>
<P>When they see the Christians sad or perplext at any thing; They give them this Gentle Reprehension; <HI>Compeer</HI> (a Familiar word they learn of the <HI>French</HI> signifying Friend or Gossip) <HI>how miserable art thou thus to expose thy Person to such tedious and dangerous Voyages and to suffer thy self to be orepressed with cares, The inor∣nate desire of getting wealth puts thee to all this trouble, and

<P>They are great enemies to thieving and live with∣out distrust of each other, their Houses and Plantati∣ons being left without keepers, but if the least thing be taken from them, such as a little knife wherewith they do strange things in Joyners work, they so highly prize its usefulness, that such a loss is enough to make them weep and grieve a week after, nay ingages them to join with their friends and demand reparations, and to be revenged on the Person, especially where the
<PB N="175" REF="91"/>
Christians live neer them, for then upon missing a y thing they presently cry, <HI>Some Christian has been here;</HI> And among the Grievances and Complaints which they make to the Governours of the <HI>French</HI> Nation, this comes always in the Front, <HI>Compere Governour, thy Mariners</HI> (for so they call all Forreigners) <HI>have taken a∣way a knife out of my Cottage,</HI> or some such small houshold-stuff; They are a people associated in one common Interest and extream loving to each other, from whence there are few Quarrels or Animosities a∣mong them, but if they are once injured either by a stranger or their own Countreymen they never for∣give, but contrive all ways to be revenged; Thus when their Sorcerers or Conjurers tell them, any one hath done them the mischief which happens to them, they endeavour all they can to kill him, saying, <HI>He hath bewitched me, I will be revenged on him;</HI> And this furious passion and desire of Revenge is that which makes them so brutish as to eat the very flesh of their enemies. This implacable Animosity is a Vice generally Reigning among them, and exercises the same Tyranny without exception over all the Sa∣vages of <HI>America.</HI> The revenge of the <HI>Canadians</HI> is very pleasant, who eat their own Lice because they bite them: If the <HI>Brasileans</HI> hurt themselves against a stone, to be revenged they bite it as hard as that can, yea they bite the Arrows which light upon them in fight∣ing;</P>
<P>They bear great respect to ancient People, hearing them speak with much attention, the younger com∣plying in all things to their Sentiments and Wills. The young men among the <HI>Caribeans</HI> have no conversati∣on either with the Maids or Married Women, and it is observed that the men in this Countrey are less a∣morous than the Women, as they are in several pla∣ces under the Torrid Zone; Yet both sexes are very chast, a rare quality among Savages. When those of other Nations look earnestly upon the Women, and laugh at their nakedness they are wont to
<PB N="176" REF="92"/>
say to them. <HI>Friends you are to look on us only between both our Eyes;</HI> A virtue worthy admiration in a people that go naked and are as barbarous as these. It is re∣lated that Captain <HI>Baron</HI> a <HI>Caribean,</HI> in one of the In∣cursions they made upon the <HI>English</HI> in <HI>Montserrat,</HI> from whence he carried a great Booty, took among other Prisoners a young Gentlewoman wife to one of the Officers of the Island, whom he caused to be brought to one of his Houses in <HI>Dominica,</HI> and being big with Child she was carefully attended by the Sa∣vage Women of the Island during her lying in, and though she lived a great while among them, yet neither he nor any other ever touched her, a great example of reservedness in such People. Yet it must be acknowledged some of them have since degenerated from that and many o∣ther Virtues of their Ancestots, the <HI>Europeans</HI> by their Unchristianlike Treatment and pernici∣ous examples, their perfidious breach of promi∣ses, rifling and burning their Houses, and Villages, and Ravishing and Debauching their Wives and Daughters, having taught them (to the perpetual Infamy of the <HI>Christian</HI> name) dissimulation, ly∣ing, Treachery, perfidiousness, Luxury,, and several other vices which were unknown before in these parts. These <HI>Caribbeans</HI> are great lovers of cleanliness, a thing extraordinary among Savages, so that if one should ease himself in their Gardens where their Potato's &amp; <HI>Cassavy</HI> Roots are planted, they would presently forsake them and not make use of any thing therein.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVI.</HI> A Prospect of the Island of St. <HI>Vin∣cent.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Island of St. <HI>Vincent</HI> lies in sixteen Degrees North from the Line, and is about twenty four Miles long, and eighteen broad, wherein are several high Mountains, between which are very fruitful Plains, yielding abundance of Sugar Canes, which grow naturally without Planting; It is well watred with Rivers, and hath several good Harbours and Bays for Shipping; The <HI>English</HI> have here some Plantati∣ons, but they are neither very considerable nor pow∣erful herein, it being the most populous of <HI>Caribeans,</HI> of any possessed by them, who have here many Fair Villages, where they dwell pleasantly and without any disturbance, and though they are jealous of the Stran∣gers that live about them, and stand on their Guard, when they come to their Roads, yet they do not deny Cassavy Bread, Water, Fruits, and other Provisions growing in their Country to them that want them, taking in Exchange, Wedges, Hooks, and other Im∣plements of Iron, which they much esteem. Their simplicity is very remarkable in several things, as in admiring our Fire-Arms, but especially Fire-locks, to which they see no Fire put as to Muskets, and there∣fore believe <HI>Maboya</HI> or the Devil sets them on Fire; When the Moon is Eclipsed, they believe the Devil eats her, and dance all night making a noise with Gourds, wherein are many pebble Stones; When they smell any evil scent, they cry, <HI>Maboya or the Devil is here, let us be gone from him.</HI></P>
<P>Some years since most of the <HI>Caribeans</HI> were per∣suaded
<PB N="178" REF="93"/>
that Gunpowder was the Seed of some Herb, and sowed some in their Gardens; They never make use of Salt, accounting it extreamly prejudicial to health, and when they see Christians use it, cry, <HI>Com∣pere, thou hastnest thy own death;</HI> but instead thereof they season all things with <HI>American</HI> Pepper, neither do they eat Swines-Flesh for this simple reason, lest they should have small Eyes like that Beast, which they judge the greatest deformity, nor Tortoise or Turtle, least they should participate of its lazyness and stupidi∣ty. They have no notion of a Deity, so that neither Prayers, Ceremonies, Sacrifices, or any exercise or Assembly whatsoever is to be found amongst them, but say the Earth is their indulgent Mother, who furnish∣es them with all things necessary to Life; if any dis∣course to them about God, and the Mysteries of our Religion, they hearken attentively, but in the end, answer as it were in jest; <HI>Friend, thou art very Eloquent and Subtle, I wish I could talk as well as thee:</HI> Nay they sometimes say, <HI>That if they should be persuaded by such dis∣courses, their Neighbours would laugh at them;</HI> A certain <HI>Caribean</HI> being at Work on a Sunday, Mounsieur <HI>Mon∣tel</HI> said to him, <HI>Friend, he that made Heaven and Earth will he angry with thee for working on this Day, for he hath ap∣pointed this Day for his Service, and I,</HI> replyed the Savage very bluntly, <HI>am already very angry with him, for thou say∣est, he is Master of the World and the Seasons; He it is there∣fore that hath forborn to send Rain in due time, and by reason of the great drowth, hath caused my</HI> Manioc, <HI>and my</HI> Pota∣toes <HI>to rot in the Ground; now since he hath treated me so ill, I will Work on every Sunday on purpose to vex him;</HI> A preg∣nant Example of the brutality of this wretched Peo∣ple.</P>
<P>Yet have they a natural Sentiment of some Divinity or Superior power, that hath its residence in Heaven, which they say is contented to enjoy quietly the de∣lights of its own felicity, without being offended at the ill actions of Men, and is endued with so great good∣ness, as not to take any revenge even of Enemies, from
<PB N="179" REF="93"/>
whence they render Heaven, neither Honour nor Ado∣ration interpreting its liberality and long sufferance, an effect either of its weakness or indifference toward Mankind; yet they believe there are a number of good and evil Spirits, the good are their Gods, and every one imagins that their is one of them particularly de∣signed for his conduct, yet will not acknowledge them Creators of the World, and when the Christians tell them, we adore that God who made Heaven and Earth, and causeth the Earth to bring forth Fruits and Herbs for our nourishment, they answer; <HI>It is true thy God hath made the Heaven and the Earth of</HI> France, <HI>(or some other Countrey that they name) and causes the Wheat to grow there, but our Gods have made our Countrey, and cause our</HI> Manioc <HI>to grow; This</HI> Manioc <HI>is a Root of a small Tree or Shrub, whereof the</HI> Caribeans <HI>make Bread.</HI> When they recover of some Disease, they set a little Table at the end of their Hutts, and upon it their offerings, but without any Adoration or Prayers, yet they invocate their false Gods, when they desire his presence, but this is done by the Priest, and that upon four occasions; <HI>To demand Revenge, To be healed of Diseases, To know the e∣vent of their Wars, To invocate them to drive away the great Devil or Maboya,</HI> for they never pray to him; His in∣vocation is by singing some words and burning Tobac∣co, the scent whereof is so pleasant, that it makes this little Devil appear, and when several Priests call upon their several Gods together, as they speak, these Gods or rather Devils rail, quarrel, and seem to fight with each other; These Demons shelter themselves, some∣times in the Bones of dead Men taken out of the Graves and wrapt in Cotton, and thereby give Oracles, say∣ing it is the Soul of the Deceased Person, they make use of them to bewitch their Enemies, the Sorcerers wrapping up these Bones with something that belongs to the Enemy.</P>
<P>These Devils do also sometimes enter into the Bo∣dies of Women, and speak by them, clearly answer∣ing all questions demanded, after the <HI>Boye</HI> or Priest is
<PB N="180" REF="94"/>
retired, the Devil stirs the Vessels, and makes a noise with his Jaws, as if he were eating and drinking the Presents prepared for him, but the next day they find he hath not medled with any thing. These poor wretches complain that sometimes <HI>Maboya</HI> beats them severely, which though some impute to Melancholy Dreams, yet other Persons of Quality and exquisite knowledge, who have long lived in St. <HI>Vinc ents</HI> Island, do affirm that the Devils do effectually beat them, and that they often shew on their Bodies the visible marks of the blows they have received, and they sometimes make horrid complaints of his cruelty, saying, <HI>That he is of late mightily incensed against the</HI> Caribeans, ac∣counting the <HI>Europeans</HI> happy that their <HI>Maboya</HI> does not beat them. Mounsieur <HI>Montel,</HI> who hath been oft present at their Assemblies, and converst much with the Inhabitants of St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> gives this Testimony upon this sad occasion. <HI>Notwithstanding the ignorance and Irreligion, wherein our</HI> Caribeans <HI>live, they know by experi∣ence, and fear more than death the Evil Spirit whom they call</HI> Maboya, <HI>for that dreadfull Enemy doth many times ap∣pear to them under most hideous shapes: And what is more particularly observable, that unmerciful and bloody Executi∣oner, who is an insatiable Murtherer from the beginning of the World, cruelly wounds and torments those miserable People, when they are not so forward as he would have them to engage in War, so that when they are reproached with Blood-Thirst∣ness,</HI> their Answer is, <HI>they are forced thereto by</HI> Maboya <HI>a∣gainst their wills.</HI></P>
<P>This cursed Spirit it is that inflames them to act such cruelty upon their Enemies taken in War, in re∣lating whereof we had need dip our pen in bloud, be∣ing to draw a Picture which must raise horror in the beholder; In this the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> appears nothing but Inhuma∣nity, Barbarism, and Rage; to see rational Creatures cruelly devouring those of the same kind with them, and filling themselves with their flesh and bloud, a thing which Pagans heretofore thought so full of Exe∣cration that they imagined the Sun withdrew
<PB N="181" REF="94"/>
himself because he would not give light to such bloudy banquets. When these <HI>Cannibals</HI> or <HI>Eaters of men</HI> (which is here their proper names) have brought home a Prisoner of War of the <HI>Arovages,</HI> he belongs of right to him who either seized him in fight, or took him running away, being then brought to this Island, he keeps him safe in his house, and after he has made him fast four or five daies, produces him upon some solemn day of debauch to serve for a publick Sacrifice to the immortal hatred of his Countreymen toward that Nation. If any of their enemies dye on the place of battel, they eat them there before they leave it, they design for slavery only the young maids and Women taken in the War. They have tasted of all the Nations that frequented them, and upon experi∣ence affirm that the <HI>French</HI> are the most tender, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> the hardest flesh of digestion, but now, they feed on no Christians at all.</P>
<P>They abstain from several Cruelties formerly used before they killed their Enemies, for whereas at pre∣sent they think it enough to dispatch them at a blow or two with a Club, and afterward cut them into peices and having boyl'd to devour them; They heretofore put them to several Torments before they gave them the mortal blow, of which they themselves have given this deplorable relation to those who have been so curious to inform themselves from their own mouths; The Prisoner of War who had been so un∣fortunate to fall into their hands, and was not igno∣rant that he was designed to receive the most cruel Treatment which rage could suggest, armed himself with constancy, and to express how generous a Peo¦ple the <HI>Arovages</HI> were, marched very cheerfully to the place of execution, not being either bound or drag'd thereto, and presented himself with a mild and steady countenance in the midst of the Assembly, which he knew desired nothing so much as his death, and not expecting their abuses and bitter discourses, he prevented them in these Terms.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="95"/><HI>I know well enough upon what account you have brought me to this place, I doubt not but you are desirous to fill your∣selves with my bloud, and that you are impatient to exercise your Teeth upon my Body; But you have not so much reason to Triumph to see me in this Condition, nor I much to be trou∣bled thereat; My Countreymen have put your Predecessors to greater miseries than you are now able to invent against me; And I have done my part with them in mangling, Massacring and devouring your People, your Friends, and your Fathers, besides that I have Relations who will not fail to revenge my quarrel with advantage upon you and upon your Children, for the most inhumane tortures you intend against me, what Torments soever the most ingenious cruelty can dictate to you for the taking away of my life is nothing in comparison of those which my generous Nation prepares for you in exchange, therefore delay not the utmost of your cruelty any longer, and assure your selves I both slight and laugh at it;</HI> Somewhat of this Nature is that brave and bloudy Bravado which we read of a <HI>Brasilean</HI> Prisoner▪ ready to be devoured of his Enemies; <HI>Come on boldly,</HI> said he to them, <HI>and feast your selves upon me, for at the same time you will seed on your Fathers and Grand-Fathers, who serv'd for nourish∣ment to my Body; These Muscles, thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> flesh, and these veins are yours, blind Fools as you are; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou do not observe that the substance of the Members of your Ancestors are yet to be seen in them, tast them well and you will find the tast of your own flesh.</HI></P>
<P>The Great Soul of our <HI>Arovagues</HI> was not only his lips, but shewed it self also in the effects which follow∣ed this Bravado; For after the company had a while endured his menaces and arrogant defiance without touching him, one among them came and burnt his sides with a flaming brand, another cut great Gob∣bets of flesh out of him, and would cut bigger if the bones would have admitted it, then they cast pepper into his wounds, others diverted themselves in shoot∣ing Arrows at the poor Patient, and every one took a pleasure in tormenting him, but he suffered with the same unconcerned countenance, and expressed not
<PB N="183" REF="95"/>
the least sence of pain; After they had thus sported a long time with the poor wretch, at last growing weary of insulting and out-braved by his constancy which seemed still the same, one of them came and at one blow dispatched him with his Club. This is the usage wherewith the <HI>Caribeans</HI> heretofore treated their Prisoners of War, but now they think it enough to put them to a speedy death. As soon as this unfor∣tunate Person is thus laid dead upon the place, the young men take the Body, and having washed it cut it in peices, and then boyl some part, and broil some upon wooden Frames made like a Gridiron for that purpose. When this detestable dish is ready and seasoned according to their Palates they divide it into so many parts as there are persons present, and joyfully devour it, thinking that the World cannot afford any other repast equally delicious; The Wo∣men lick the very sticks whereon the fat dropped, not so much from the deliciousness they find in that kind of sustenance as from the excessive pleasure they conceive in being revenged in that manner of their cheifest enemies, and to heighten this rage and hatred against the <HI>Arovages</HI> they save the fat that comes from it; and keep it carefully in little Gourds to pour some few drops thereof into their sauces at their solemn entertainments, so to perpetuate as much as lies in their power, the motive of revenge.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIX.</HI> A Prospect of the Island of <HI>Antego.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Island of <HI>Antego</HI> lies in the Latitude of sixteen degrees and eleven minutes between <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and <HI>Desiderado.</HI> In length about Twenty Miles, and much of the same bredth; The access to it is dan∣gerous for shipping by reason of the Rocks which in∣compass it; It was conceived heretofore that it was not to be inhabited upon presumption that there was no fresh Water in it, but the <HI>English</HI> who have planted themselves in it have met with some, and make Ponds and Cisterns to supply that defect, it being inhabited by eight or nine hundred Persons. The Commodities this Island affords are <HI>Sugar, Jndico, Ginger</HI> and <HI>Tobacco.</HI> It abounds in tame Cattel, and all sorts of Fish, among which the <HI>Shark-Fish</HI> deserves remark; It is a kind of <HI>Sea-dog,</HI> or <HI>Sea-Wolf,</HI> the most devouring of all Fishes, &amp; the most greedy of mans flesh &amp; therefore dangerous to those that swim, he lives altogether by prey, and commonly follows ships to feed on the filth cast out of them into the Sea; These Monsters seem yellow in the Water, some of them of a vast length and bigness, insomuch that they are able to cut a man in two at one bite; Their Skin so rough that files are made of it to polish Wood; Their heads are flat, and the opening of their mouth not just before the snout but under it, so that they are forced to turn their Bel∣lies almost upward when they seize their Prey; Their Teeth are very sharp and broad jagged about like a Saw, of which some have three or four ranks in each Jaw-Bone, they lye within his gums, but sufficiently appear when there is occasion. These cruel <HI>Sea-Dogs</HI>
<PB N="185" REF="96"/>
are attended by two or three small Fishes and some∣times more, which go before them with such swiftness, and exactness that they either go forward or stay as he does; The Meat of him is not good, but the brains are counted useful against the stone and Gravel.</P>
<P>Another Ravenous Sea-Monster found on these Coasts is called the <HI>Becune,</HI> a dreadful enemy to Mankind, in shape like a Pike but seven or eight foot long, he lives by prey, &amp; furiously fastens like a bloud-hound on the men he perceives in the Water. He carries away whatever he once fastens on, and his teeth are so venemous, that the least touch of them becomes mor∣tal, if some Soveraign Antidote be not instantly ap∣plied to divert and abate the Poyson. There are another kind of <HI>Becunes</HI> by some call <HI>Sea Wood-Cocks,</HI> their beaks being somewhat like a Wood-cocks bill only the up∣per part is much longer than the lower, and it moves both Jaws with like facility; Some of them are four foot long and twelve Inches broad neer the head, which is somewhat like a Swines, with two large eyes extreamly Shining, he hath two Fins on the sides and under the Belly a great plume rising higher like a Cocks comb, reaching from head to Tail: Besides the long solid beak, it hath two sorts of Horns, hard, black, and about a foot and an half in length which hang down under his throat and are particular to this kind of fish, and these he can easily hide in a hollow place under his Belly which serves them for a Sheath, it hath no Scales but a rough black Skin on the back, and the meat is eatable. Another Fish found neer these Islands is called the <HI>Sea Ʋrchin</HI> or <HI>Hedghog,</HI> and well deserves that name, it is round as a Ball and full of Sharp prickles for which it is feared, some call it the armed Fish, they are sent as Presents to the curious to hang in their closets.</P>
<P>The Sea Parrots are likewise admirable which have beautiful sparkling eyes the Balls cleer as Chrystal, inclosed within a circle as green as an Emerald of which
<PB N="186" REF="97"/>
colour are the Scales of their backs; They have no Teeth but Jaws above and below of a solid bone very strong, of the same colour with their Scales and divid∣ed into little Compartiments very beautiful to the Eye, they live on shel fish, and with those hard Jaw-bones they crush, as between two Milstones, Oysters, Muscles and other shell fish to get out the meat. They are an excellent kind of Fish to eat, and so big that some of them have weighed above Twenty pound. The <HI>Dorado</HI> by some called the Sea Bream, by others the Amber-Fish is also common in these patts, so called, because in the Water the head seems to be of a green gilt, and the rest of the Body as yellow as gold. It has pleasure in following Ships, but is so swift that it is very hard to take, being ex∣treamly well furnished for swimming, having the fore∣part of the head sharp, the back bristled with prickles reaching to the Tail which is forked, two Fins on each side the head and as many under the Belly, and the whole body rather broad than big, all which give him a strange command of the Water, he is as good meat as Trout or Salmon, they are caught only with a peice of White Linnen tyed to the Hook.</P>
<P>This Island likewise abounds in several sorts of Fowls and Birds, those of an extraordinary kind are first the <HI>Canades,</HI> which are the most beautiful Birds in the World (saith my Author,) under the belly and Wings it is of a waving Aurora colour, the back and one half of the Wings of a very bright Sky colour, the tail and greater feathers of the Wings are mixt with a Sparkling Carnation, diversifyed with a Sky, upon the back it was grass green and shining black, which very much added to the Gold and Azure of the other Plumage, but the most beautiful part was the head co∣vered with a murrey down, chequered with green, yellow, and a pale blew which reach'd down wavingly to his back, the eye-lids were white, and the apple of the eye yellow and red like a Ruby set in Gold, it had upon the head a tuft or C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p of Feathers of a

This that our A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> saw spoke the <HI>Dutch, Spa∣nish,</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> Language, and in the last he sung Airs as a natural <HI>Indian;</HI> He also imitated the cries of all sorts of Poultry and other creatures about the House, he called his Friends by their Names and Sirnames, and flew to them when he saw them e∣specially when he was hungry, and if they had been long absent, exprest his Joy at their return. In a word, he was a present for a Prince, if he could have been brought over the Sea.</P>
<P>The <HI>Flamant</HI> is a great and beautiful bird about the bigness of a Wild goose, his beak is like a Spoon, his Neck and Legs very long, so that his Body is three foot from the ground, when they are young their fea∣thers are white, then murrey, and when old of a bright Carnation, they are seldom seen but in great Compa∣nies, &amp; their hearing &amp; smelling is so perfect that they smell the Huntsmen and fire-arms at a great distance, and therefore for fear of surprize they live in open places in the midst of the Fens, one of them being al∣ways on the Guard, while the rest are searching the Waters for a livelihood; as soon as he hears the least noise or perceives a man, he takes his flight and gives a great cry for a signal to the rest to follow him; when the Huntsmen take them they get the wind of them that they may not smell the Powder, and covering themselves with an Oxhide creep on their hands and feet till they come to a place whence they may be sure to kill them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP▪ VIII</HI> A Prospect of the Island of <HI>Mevis.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Island of <HI>Mevis</HI> or <HI>Nevis</HI> lies in seventeen de∣grees, and nineteen Minutes North of the Line; It is not above eighteen Miles round, and in the midst there is but one only Mountain, which is very high, and covered with great Trees up to the very top, a∣bout which all the Plantations are setled, beginning from the Sea-side to the very highest part of it; It hath within it divers Springs of Fresh-water, whereof some are strong enough to make their way into the Sea, one Spring hath the waters so hot and Mineral, that from the force of it there are Baths made, found very beneficial in several Diseases. The <HI>English</HI> who planted themselves there in 1628. and are still Possessors there∣of, being now about three or four Thousand Inhabi∣tants, drive a very handsome Trade with <HI>Sugar, Gin∣ger, Tobacco</HI> and <HI>Cotton,</HI> which they exchange for other conveniencies, it is the best governed of any of the <HI>Ca∣ribee</HI> Islands, impartial justice being administred, and all debauchery and immorality severely punished by a Council of the most Eminent and Ancient Inhabitants. There are three Churches erected for the Service of God; And for the security of Vessels in the Road, there is a Fort, wherein are planted several great Guns, that command at a great distance, which likewise se∣cure their Storehouses, into which all the Commodi∣ties imported for the use of the Inhabitants are disposed, and from thence distributed to those that have occasi∣on for them; It is indifferent Fruitful, and hath store of Deer, and other Game for Hunting.</P>
<P>In this Island there are <HI>Lizards</HI> five Foot in length, and a Foot about, their skins are of divers Colours,

<HEAD>Strange Creatures in America</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB REF="99"/>
<PB N="189" REF="99"/>
according to the different Soil they are bred in, some of them have their Scales and Skin so glittering, that at a distance they look like rich Cloth of Gold and Sil∣ver, they have four Feet, each with five Claws, and very sharp Nails, they run fast and climb Trees dexte∣rously, and whether they love Men or are stupid, they stand still, looking on the Huntsmen, suffering them to put a Gin with a running knot about their Necks, which is fastened to the end of a Pole, whereby they get them off the Trees where they rest themselves; Their Jaws are wide, with very sharp Teeth, their Tongues thick, and they hold fast what they catch with their Teeth, which are not at all venemous, the Females lay Eggs about the bigness of Woodcocks, the Shell is soft, which they lay deep in the Sand on the Sea-shores to be hatched by the Sun, they are sometimes eaten though disliked by many. The <HI>Annolis</HI> is another creature very common in all the Plan∣tations, about the bigness of a Lizard, but the head longer, the Skin yellowish, and on their backs they have green, blew and gray streaks drawn from the top of the head to the end of the Tail, they live in holes under ground, whence in the night they make a very loud and importunate noise, in the day they are con∣tinually wandring about Cottages for subsistence. A <HI>Land-pike</HI> is another strange Reptile so called from its likeness to that Fish, but instead of Fins it hath four feet which are so weak that they only crawl on the ground, and wind their bodies as Pikes newly taken out of the Water, the longest are about fifteen inches and proportionably big; Their Skin is covered with little Scales which shine extreamly, and are of a Sil∣ver gray colour, in the night they make a hideous noise from under the Rocks, and the bottoms of hollow pla∣ces where they are lodg'd; It is more sharp and grating to the ear than Frogs or Toads, and they change their notes according to the variety of the place where they lurk, they are seldom seen but a little before night, and when met in the day their strange motion is apt on a sudden to affright the Spectator.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="100"/>There is an Insect in these Islands called a <HI>Souldier,</HI> somewhat like a Snail, but have no Shells proper to themselves, and therefore to secure the weakness of their little bodies against the injuries of the Air, and the attempts of other Beasts, they take possession of such a shell as they find most convenient, which is commonly that of Perriwinkles; As they grow big∣ger they Shift their Shells and get into larger, they have instead of a foot an instrument like a Crabs Claw, wherewith they close the entrance of their Shells, and secure their whole body, if he be set neer the Fire he forsakes his Quarters, if it be presented to him to get in again he goes in backward, when they all intend to change lodgings, to which they are much inclined, there happens a serious engagement managed with that clasping Instrument, till at length the strongest by Conquest gets possession which he peaceably enjoys during his pleasure. Another Insect called the <HI>flying Tygar</HI> is observable, the Body is chequered with spots of divers colours as the Tygar is, about the bigness of an horned Beetle, the head sharp with two great Eyes as green and Sparkling as an Emerald, his mouth is arm'd with two hard hooks extreamly sharp, wherewith he holds fast his prey while he gets the substance, the whole body is covered with a hard and swarthy cru∣stiness which serves him for armour; Under his Wings, which are also of solid matter, there are four less Wings as soft as Silk, it hath six Legs, each whereof hath three Joints, and they are bristled with certain little prickles; In the day he is continually catching Flies, and other little Animals, and in the Night sits Singing on the Trees. The <HI>Horn∣fly</HI> is another which hath two snouts like an Elephant, one turning upward, and the other down about three Inches long, the head is blew like a Grashopper, the two Eyes green, the upper side of the Wings of a bright Violet, Damaskt with Carnation, heightned by a small natural thred of Silver, the Colours drawn with such Curiosity, that the most curious Painting cannot

I imagined (saith my Author (it had been Artificial because of the lively Carnation colour and the string of Silver, but having taken it in my hand, I thought nature must certainly be in an excellent hu∣mour, and had a mind to divert her self when she be∣stowed such sumptuous Robes on this little Q. of Insects.</P>
<P>A Monstruous Spider is likewise found in these parts so large that when her legs are spred she takes up above the bredth of a mans hand, the Body consists of 2 parts, one flat and the other round, smaller at one end like a Pigeons egg, with a hole in the back, which is as it were their Navil, it is armed with two Sharp tushes solid and black, smoot and shining, so that some set them in Gold for Tooth-pickers, esteemed to have a virtue of preserving from pain and corruption the places rubbed therewith, when they grow old they are covered with a swarthy down soft as Velvet, they have ten feet having each four Joints armed at the ends with a black hard-horn. They every year shift their old Skins and their two Tushes, they feed on flyes and such vermine, and it hath been observed that in some places their Webs are so strong that little Birds can hardly extricate themselves from them. The <HI>Palmer-worm</HI> is notable from the almost infinite number of Feet, which are as bristles under his Body, and help him to creep along the ground with incre∣dible swiftness if persued; It is half a Foot long, the upper part covered with swarthy Scales, which are hard and jointed one within another like the Tiles of a House, but what is dangerous in this Creature is, that he hath a kind of Claw both in his head and Tail, wherewith he twitches so home and so poysonous the wounded place, that for four and twenty hours the pa∣tient feels great pain. There was some years since brought from thence a Bird about the bigness &amp; shape of a <HI>Swallow,</HI> only the two great Feathers of the Tail a little shorter and the beak turned down like a Parrot, and the feet like a Ducks, it was black only under the Belly, a little white like our Swallows, in fine, it was so like them that it may be called the <HI>Swallow of Ame∣rica.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="101"/>The <HI>Fly Catcher</HI> is a very pretty Animal, it is a four legged Creature, of a very small size, some of them seem to be covered with fine Gold or Silver Bro∣cado, others with a mixture of green, Gold, and other delightful colours, they are so familiar that they come boldly into rooms, where they do no mischief, nay on the contrary cleer them of Flyes and such Vermine, which they perform with such nimbleness and slight that the cunning of Huntsmen is not compa∣rable to it, for he lies down on a plank where he hopes the Fly will come and keeps his eye alway fixt upon it, putting his head into as many different postures as the Fly shifts places, and standing upon his fore-feet and gaping after it, he half opens his little Wide Mouth as if he had already swallowed it in hope, nay though a noise be made and one come neer him, nothing disturbs him, and having at last found his ad∣vantage he starts so directly on his prey that he very seldom misses it; They are so tame as to come upon the Table at dinner, and attempt to catch a Fly there or upon their hands or cloths being very neat clean things; They lay small eggs as big as Pease, which hav∣ing covered with a little Earth they leave to be hatched by the Sun, as soon as they are killed all their beauty vanishes, and they become pale.

<P>THis Island was so named by <HI>Christopher Columbus,</HI> who finding it very pleasant gave it his own name, which the shape of the Mountains likewise in∣clined him to, for it hath on its upper part as it were upon one of its shoulders another lesser Mountain, as St. <HI>Christopher</HI> is painted like a Giant, carrying our Sa∣viour

upon his as it were a little Child; It is scituated seventeen degrees and twenty five Minutes on this side the Line, &amp; is about twenty five Leagues in compass, the soil being light and sandy is apt to produce all sorts of the Country Fruits, with many of the choicest growing in <HI>Europe;</HI> It lyes high in the midst by reason of some very high Mountains, out of which arise seve∣ral Rivers, which do sometimes so suddenly overflow through the Rains falling from the Mountains, that the Inhabitants are thereby surprized; The whole Island is divided into four Cantons or Quarters, two whereof are possessed by the <HI>Engli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h,</HI> and two by the <HI>French,</HI> but so separated that People cannot go from one quarter to the other, without passing over the Lands of one of the two Nations. The <HI>English</HI> have more little Rivers in their Division, the <HI>French</HI> more of the plain Country fit for Tillage; The <HI>English</HI> ex∣ceed the <HI>French</HI> in number, but the <HI>French</HI> have four Forts and the <HI>English</HI> only two, and to prevent diffe∣rences between the two Nations, each of them have a Guard upon the Frontiers of their Division, which is renewed every day.</P>
<P>There is a fine Salt Pit in the Island, and some con∣ceive there is a Silver Mine, but because the Salt Pits, Woods, Havens and Mines are common to both Peo∣ple, it is not regarded, besides the great stock, and multitude of slaves which such an enterprize would re∣quire; The true Silver Mine is Sugar; This Island may be easily incompassed by Land, but one cannot pass through the midst of it, by reason of several great and steep Mountains, between which are dreadful Rocks, Precipices, and springs of hot Water, yea some springs of <HI>Sulphur</HI> which causeth one of them to be called the <HI>Sulphur Mountain;</HI> The Island seems to descend gently toward the Sea, and is divid∣ed into several Stages, from the uppermost whereof a man may take a very pleasant Prospect of all the Plantations from thence downward; There are many gallant Houses built both by the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French,</HI>
<PB N="194" REF="102"/>
and the <HI>English</HI> have also erected five fair Churches well furnished within with Pulpits and Seats of ex∣cellent Joyners work of precious wood; The Mini∣sters being sent thither by the Lord Arch-bishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> and <HI>English</HI> Colonies, had their beginning at the same time, for in 1625. Monsieur <HI>Desnambuck</HI> a <HI>French,</HI> and St. <HI>Thomas Warner</HI> an <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Gentleman jointly took possession of St. <HI>Christophers</HI> on the same day, in the names of the Kings of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>France</HI> their Masters, that they might have a place of safe retreat, and a good Haven for the Ships of both Nations bound for <HI>America,</HI> as being well fur∣nished with Provisions, and therefore often visited by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who sometimes left the sick there to be look'd to by the <HI>Caribeans</HI> with whom they had made a peace upon those Terms.</P>
<P>These two Gentlemen having thus taken possession of the Island, left some men therein to secure it, and re∣turned for the further establishment of these Colo∣nies, to their respective Countreys; But before they parted hence, suspecting some private Intelligence between the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> for destroying all the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> in their absence, they in one night rid their hands of the most factious of that Nati∣on, and soon after forced all the rest, who were got together in several Bodies and stood upon their Guard, to retire to some other Islands, and leave that to their disposal. After this they both returned home, where their Conquests and Proceedings being approved of by the Kings their Masters, they returned with recruits of men in the quality of Governors, and Lieutenants under the Kings of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and hav∣ing divided the Island according to their first Agree∣ment, and the <HI>English</HI> having plentiful Provisions from <HI>London,</HI> prospered much more than the <HI>French,</HI> who wanted necessary assistance.</P>
<P>In 1629. a powerfull Fleet from <HI>Spain</HI> under <HI>Don Frederick de Toledo</HI> had received order from that King, that before he fell down to the <HI>Havana,</HI> he should
<PB N="195" REF="102"/>
touch at St. <HI>Christophers,</HI> and force thence all the <HI>En∣glish</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> who had planted themselves there for some years before. This Navy consisted of twenty four great Ships of Burden, and fifteen Frigots, who first seized some <HI>English</HI> Ships lying at Anchor near the Isle of <HI>Mevis;</HI> And then came and cast Anchor in the Road of St. <HI>Christophers,</HI> in the <HI>French</HI> Division, and the Forts of both Colonies being not in a condition to stand out a Siege, unfurnished with Ammunition and Provisions, nay all the Forces of the Nations in Con∣junction, not being able to have opposed so great an Army, it was a great discouragement to them, yet re∣solving the Enemy should not boast they had com∣passed their designs without blows they made a very Vigorous opposition, but being over powered by number, the <HI>French</HI> forsook the Island, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>snam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Imbarquing all his Men in certain Ships, which chanced to be in the Haven. The Quarters of the <HI>English</HI> upon this In∣telligence were in great disorder, and in continual expectation that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would fall upon them. Some endeavouring to escape by Sea, or shelter them∣selves in the Mountains, while others somewhat more couragious, sent Deputies to <HI>Don Frederick</HI> to propose an accommodation; But all the answer they received was, an express command immediately to depart the Island, or to be treated with that Rigour, which the Law of Arms permits to be used toward those who wrongfully possess what belongs not to them, and to speed their departure, he ordered those <HI>English</HI> Ships taken at <HI>Mevis</HI> should be restored to them, wherein they should Imbarque Instantly for <HI>England,</HI> and be∣cause it was impossible those Vessels should contain so great a number, he permitted the rest to continue in the Isle till they had opportunity of Transportation.</P>
<P>These things dispatcht, <HI>Don Frederick</HI> weighed An∣chor, but as soon as the Fleet was out of sight, the <HI>English</HI> who were left behind, began to rally, and took a resolution couragiously to carry on the Settlement of their Colony; During these Transactions at St. <HI>Christo∣phers,</HI>
<PB N="196" REF="103"/>
the <HI>French</HI> who went to Sea, having suffered ma∣ny inconveniences, were forced to put in at the Islands of St. <HI>Martin</HI> and <HI>Montserrat,</HI> but looked on them as Desarts in comparison of the place they had left, and being desirous to be informed of the condition of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> there, sent one of their Ships to St. <HI>Christo∣phers,</HI> who returning gave them an account the Enemy was gone, and the <HI>English</HI> couragiously imployed in Re building, Planting, and repairing Desolations; This unexpected good News revived their decayed hopes, and persuaded them to a speedy return; The <HI>English</HI> Colony with constant supplies from <HI>London,</HI> from that time grew very powerful, peopling not on∣ly this place, but sending new Plantations from hence to <HI>Barbuda, Montserrat, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntego</HI> and <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> which are grown very numerous and famous for the Trade of the rich commodities they are furnished with, as well as this curious Island, whose chiefest Trade is <HI>Sugar Tobacc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Cotton, Ginger,</HI> with several other sorts of Fruits and Provisions.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rocquet</HI> is a pretty Animal in this Isle, their skin is of the colour of a withered leaf, marked with little Yellow or blewish Points, they go on four feet those before being highest, their Eyes lively and sparkling, their heads always lifted up, and so active that they leap up and down perpetually like Birds when they make no use of their Wings, their Tails are so turned up toward their back that they make a Circle and an half; They love to look upon men, and are constantly staring on them; When they are pur∣sued they open their Mouths, and put out their Tongues like little Hounds. There is a large Bird in the <HI>Carribees</HI> called the Eagle of <HI>Orinca</HI> much like an Eagle in shape; All his Feathers are of light Gray marked with black Spots, save that the ends of his Wings and Tail are yellow, he hath a piercing sight, and feeds on other Birds, yet to shew his generosity he never sets upon the waeker sort, but those that are armed with crook∣ed beaks and sharp Tallons like himself, nay it is ob∣servable

he never seizes his prey on the ground or a Tree, but stays till it has taken his flight that he may ingage it in the open air with equal advantage, upon whom he furiously fastens his Tallons, and having mastered them tears them in peices and devours them. There is also a large Bird in these Islands called a <HI>Craw fowl</HI> about the bigness of a great Duck, the feathers Ash colour, and hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eous to the eye, it hath a long Flat beak, a great head, small eyes deep set in his heed, and a short neck, under which hangs a bag or Craw so big that it will contain two Gallons of Wa∣ter, they are commonly found on Trees by the Sea∣side, where as soon as they perceive a Fish at advan∣tage they seize it, and swallow it whole, they are so at∣tentive on their Fishing having their Eye constantly on the Sea, that they are easily shot and become a Prey to others; their sight is so admirable that they will discover a Fish at a great distance in the Sea and above a fathom under Water, yet stay till they come almost even with it before they seize; Their Flesh is not to be eaten; Here are likewise found a kind of Pheasants which are called <HI>Pintado's,</HI> because they are as it were painted with colours, and have about them small points like so many Eyes on a Dark ground.</P>
<P>To conclude with these Fowls we shall give an Ac∣count of the <HI>Colibry,</HI> or <HI>Humming Bird,</HI> which is admirable for its beauty, bulk, sweet scent, and manner of life, for being the least of all Birds he gloriously confirm the saying of <HI>Pliny, That nature is ever greatest in its least Productions;</HI> Some of these Birds are no bigger bodied than the greater sorts of Flies, yet of such beautiful feathers, that the neck, wings and back represent the Rain-bow, there are others that have such a bright red under their neck that at a distance one would imagine it to be a Carbuncle, the Belly and under the Wings are yellow as Gold, the thighs Green like an Emerald, the feet and beak as black as polished Ebony, the two little eyes two diamonds set in an oval of the co∣lour

Twenty thousand Inhabitants besides Negro Slaves who are thought a far greater number. In the reign of K. <HI>James</HI> the first a Ship of Sr. <HI>William Curteens</HI> re∣turning from <HI>Fernambuck</HI> in <HI>Brasil,</HI> being driven by soul weather upon this Coast, chanced to fall upon this Island, and anchoring before it staid some time to in∣form themselves of the nature thereof, which was so exceedingly over-grown with Woods that they could find no Champion or <HI>Savana's</HI> for men to dwell in, nor any Beasts but a multitude of Swine, which the <HI>Portugals</HI> put ashoar long before for breed, if they should at any time be cast on that shoar in foul wea∣ther, and the fruits and roots that grew there afforded so great plenty of food as they multiplied abundantly, so that the Natives of the other Islands use to come thither a hunting; This discovery being made, and advice given to their Friends in <HI>England,</HI> other Ships were sent, and having cut down the Woods, and cleered the ground, they planted Potatoes, Plantines and Maiz, which with the Hogsflesh they found served only to keep Life and Soul together, and their supplies from <HI>England,</HI> coming so slow and uncertain, they were oft driven to great extremities, but in the year 1627. when they had more hands, and having <HI>Tobacco, Indico, Cotton Wool,</HI> and <HI>Fustick Wood</HI> to trade with, some Ships were invited with hope of gain to visit them, bringing for exchange such things as they wanted, as working Tools of Iron, and Steel, Cloaths, Shirts, Drawers, Hose, Shoes, Hats, and more Planters; So that in a short time they grew very considerable, especially when their Sugar Canes were grown, and they had learned the Art of making Sugar; The In∣habitants which consist of <HI>English, Scotch, Irish,</HI> with some few <HI>Dutch, French</HI> and <HI>Jews,</HI> were lately calcu∣lated to be above fifty Thousand, and the Negro's about an hundred Thousand; So that they can in a short time arm Ten Thousand fighting men, which with the natural advantage of the place, is able to defy the most potent Enemy, as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have sound

to their cost, having in vain assaulted it several times.</P>
<P>It hath only one River or rather a Lake which runs not far into the Land, yet the Country lying low, and level they have divers Ponds, and are supplyed with Rain Water by making Cisterns in their Houses; The Air is very hot for eight months, and would be more insupportable were it not for the cool breezes which rise with the Sun, and blow still fresher as that grows higher, but always from the Northeast except in the <HI>Turnado,</HI> and then it chop▪ about to the South an hour or two, and after returns as before, the other four months are not so hot, but like the air of <HI>England</HI> about the middle of <HI>May,</HI> and though they sweat yet find not such faintness as in <HI>England</HI> in <HI>August,</HI> neither are they thirsty unless overheated with labour or strong drink. Their Bread is made of the root of a small Tree or Shrub which they call <HI>Cassavy,</HI> and account it wholsome and nourishing.</P>
<P>They have a drink called <HI>Mobbie</HI> made of <HI>Potatoes;</HI> Another named <HI>Perino,</HI> which is reckoned much better though not altogether so pleasant, made by the <HI>Indians</HI> for their own drinking of the <HI>Cassavy</HI> Root, which of it self is a strong Poyson, and this they cause their old Women whose Breath and Teeth have been tainted with many several Poxes, to chew and spit out into the Water, for the better breaking and macerating the Root, and in three or four hours this juice will work and purge it self of the poysonous quality, for the old Womens poysnous Breath and the Poyson of the <HI>Cassavy</HI> being opposites, work with such vehemency a∣gainst each other as they spend their poysonous quali∣ty in the conflict; They drink likewise <HI>Puncb, Plum drink, Plantane drink,</HI> A strong drink made of the skimming of Sugar, Beveridge, and Wine of Pines, which is the best of all; Their Meat is generally Hogs Flesh exceeding good, they feeding on nothing but Pompious as sweet as Mellons, Plantanes, Sugar Canes and Maiz; They have also Turkies, Pullets, Muscovy Ducks, Turtle Doves, Pidgeons and Rabbits; With

excellent Fish, many kinds not known to us, as the green Turtle, who coming in with the Tyde, lye up∣on the Sands till the next return, and are easily taken in the <HI>Lucaick</HI> Islands, though not in this, but sent hither; For it is but turning them on their Backs with staves, and there they lye till they are fetcht away; A large Turtle (as we have mentioned) will have in her body half a Bushel of Eggs which she lays in the Sand, where they are hatcht by the Sun. When you are to kill one of these Fishes, you lay him on his Back on a Table, and when he sees you come with a Knife in your hand to kill him, he sends forth the most grie∣vous sighs that ever were heard, and sheds Tears in abundance, after he is opened, and his Heart taken out, if you lay it in a Dish, it will stir and pant ten hours after the Fish is dead, there is no more de∣licate in tast, nor more nourishing than he.</P>
<P>This Island may be divided into Masters, Servants and Slaves; The Masters live in all affluence of plea∣sure and delight, the Servants after five years be∣come Freemen of the Island, and then imploy their time as may be most to their advantage; but the <HI>Negro</HI>-Slaves and their Children being in Bondage for ever, are preserved with greater care; but used with such severity, as occasioned a great Conspiracy against their Masters some years since, which was so closely carried as no discovery was made till the day before it was to be acted, and then one of them either failing of his courage, or out of love to his Master, discover∣ed and prevented it, for which many of them were put to death, as a terror to the rest, who being so nu∣merous might prove dangerous, but that they are kept in such strict aw, and not suffered to touch or handle a Weapon, so that nothing is more terrible to them than Gunshot; and besides being of different Countreys, they speak divers Languages, and do not understand one another; For in some of those places in <HI>Africa,</HI> where petty Kingdoms are, they sell their Subjects, and such as they take in Battel, whom they make
<PB N="202" REF="106"/>
Slaves, yea some poor Men sell their Servants, their Children, and sometimes their Wives, for such Traf∣fick as our Merchants bring them; When they are brought hither, the Planters buy them out of the Ship, where they find them stark naked, and therefore can∣not be deceived in any outward Infirmity, chusing them as they do Horses in a Market, the strongest, youthfulest and most beautiful yield the greatest price; Thirty Pound Sterling for a Man, and Twenty five for a Woman, is usual; if they buy any that have no Wives, they will come to their Masters and complain they cannot live without, and he provides them one by the next Ships; Religion they have none, yet seem to acknowledge a God, by looking up to Heaven for revenge when they are wronged; One Negro Woman being brought to Bed of two Children, her Husband provided a Cord to hang her as false to him, but the Overseer prevented it, by telling him it was common with the <HI>English</HI> Women, and they liked them the better, yet if he were resolved to Hang her, he should be Hanged himself by her, the fear of which hindred him.</P>
<P>The chief Towns in this Isle are St. <HI>Michaels</HI> for∣merly called <HI>Bridge-Town, Little Bristol,</HI> St. <HI>James,</HI> and <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> with other Parishes of less note, and several Bays on the Seacoasts. The Goverment is by Laws agreeable to those in <HI>England;</HI> For which they have Courts of Judicature, Justices of Peace, Consta∣bles, Church-wardens and the like. The Island is very strong as well by nature as Art; It is divided into ele∣ven Precincts, wherein are fourteen Churches and Chappels, the whole so filled with Houses that it may almost seem one Great Town. There is a Fish called a <HI>Rock-fish</HI> taken neer this Island, which is red, Inter∣mixt with several other colours very delightful to the Eye; And a great Fly called by the <HI>Indians Cucuyos</HI> which gives such a great light, in the night that it is cal∣led the <HI>Flying Torch</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> not only guiding the Traveller by shewing his way in the night, but with the assistance of this light a man may easily write and read

Following; The King of <HI>Spain</HI> was not ignorant these preparations were designed against the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and having dispatcht Expresses into those parts, he sent the Marquess of <HI>Leda</HI> in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>plendid Amb ssy t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Cromwel,</HI> but had such cold reception that he quickly returned; In the mean time the Fleet steered its course from <HI>Barbadoes</HI> to <HI>Hispaniola</HI> one of the richest Islands in <HI>America,</HI> which was much wondered at, since at that time no open Hos∣tility was declared against <HI>Spain,</HI> and though it was al∣ledged, That the conditions of Peace extended not beyond the line, yet the <HI>Spaniard</HI> lookt on it as an ab∣solute breach; The beginning of this Enterprize met with a Remarkable check, for when General <HI>Venables</HI> might have landed very neer St. <HI>Domingo,</HI> the chief Town in the Isle and deserted by the Garrison, yet ruled by strange Counsels of his own, or as some say overuled by his Wife, he set his men ashoar ten Lea∣gues Westward of it, whereupon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> took Courage and betook themselves again to the defence of St. <HI>Domingo.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> landing, and seeing no opposition thought themselves safe, and Lords of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and were already sharing the Golden Mines among them∣selves; When contrary to their expectation, the Gene∣ral caused it to be proclaimed at the head of the Army, that none upon pain of Death should Plunder any Gold, Plate or Jewels, or kill any Cattle; Which damping their Spirits and the excessive heat of the Climate weakning their Bodys, by that time they had marched a most tedious and disconsolate March, through thick Woods, in deep scalding Sands, ready to perish with miserable drought and Thirst for want of Water, of which they met not with a drop in many miles, they were brought into such a Condition that they needed not an Enemy to kill them, being already almost dead with faintness and weakness, so that the <HI>Spaniards Negro's</HI> and <HI>Molatto's</HI> falling upon them, destroyed them without resistance, till they were weary of killing, and those thought themselves happy, who
<PB N="205" REF="107"/>
could make their escape to their Ships. Major Gene∣ral <HI>Hains</HI> and above six hundred others fell in this skirmish besides near as many more in stragling Par∣ties, and all this Execution was done with the loss of not above sixty of the Enemy. The remnant of this Naval Army, that they might not be thought to have undertaken so long a Voyage, and of such expectation in vain, possest themselves with little or no opposition of the Island of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> which though not so plentiful and rich as the place they aimed at, yet with much In∣dustry, and the Supplies sent them from <HI>England,</HI> they made it a tolerable Habitation to abide in, planting themselves at <HI>Oristano</HI> the chief, and then only Town therein. In 1658. five hundred <HI>Spaniards</HI> under <HI>Don Christopher Arnaldo Saffer</HI> landed in this Island, and be∣gan to fortifie themselves at a place called St. <HI>Ann,</HI> but were fiercely set upon by the <HI>English,</HI> and forced to fly into the Woods and Mountains; and another body of three hundred <HI>Spaniards,</HI> having fortified themselves at <HI>Chareras</HI> in the North of this Island, were by the then Governor Collonel <HI>Doyly</HI> driven quite out of their hold, <HI>Don Francisco de Preucia,</HI> the <HI>Maestro del Campo</HI> with others taken, many killed, and the rest ut∣terly dispersed.</P>
<P>This grand disaster with many petty ill successes caused the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to dispair of regaining the Island, and to Ship off most of their Plate and Women, and the <HI>Negro</HI>'s finding the greatest part of their Masters to be dead, killed the Governour, and decline all obedience to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> chusing themselves a Black for their Governour, and such was the weakness of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that instead of correcting them they were forced to beg their assistance, which yet would not prevail, for soon after they submitted to the <HI>English</HI> Government, and made Discoveries of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Negro</HI>'s that would not join with them; whereup∣on the next year the <HI>Spaniards</HI> quite deserted the Island, except thirty or forty of their Slaves who be∣took themselves to the Mountains, but being afraid of a
<PB N="206" REF="108"/>
discovery, and to be pursued to death for some Mur∣thers by them committed, they built themselves Ca∣noo's, and in them fled to <HI>Cuba,</HI> and never since had any considerable attempt made upon them. The <HI>En∣glish</HI> being thus become Masters of the Island, formed themselves into a Colony, and begun to settle Plantati∣ons, while others betook themselves to Sea as Privateers, the better to secure themselves against the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and force them to a Peace by seizing their Ships, where∣in they were very successful. This caused the Isle to be much talked of and esteemed by the <HI>English,</HI> who sent them supplies of Men, Provisions and necessaries, and thus by degrees it became so potent as now it is; And though the success of the <HI>English</HI> at the beginning of the <HI>Spanish</HI> War was but in-different, yet it afterward proved Fortunate enough by gaining several Victories, &amp; great prizes from them as our <HI>English Virgil</HI> then Sung.</P>
