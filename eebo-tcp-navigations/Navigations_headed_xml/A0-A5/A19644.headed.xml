<L>VVHat sullen Prose in harshnes did rehearse,</L>
<L>Smiles through thy soule with a diffusiue light</L>
<L>Like the <HI>Promethean</HI> fire: for by thy verse</L>
<L>Are wakened from the <HI>Chaos</HI> of blacke night</L>
<L>The worthies of our time, that by thy pen</L>
<L>Rise from obliuions graue to life agen.</L>
<L>And for their sakes <HI>Mars</HI> with a steely Traine</L>
<L>Of his vndaunted Sons presents thy brow,</L>
<L>The guerdon of thy sweet Poeticke vaine</L>
<L>A Lawrell of <HI>Mineruaes</HI> choicest bow:</L>
<L>Proceede in thy designes, and let thy praise</L>
<L>Out liue the crooked carping age of dayes.</L>
