<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT
HONORABLE, SIR
<HI>Robert Cecill</HI> Knight, principall Se∣cretarie
to her Maiestie, Master of the Court of
VVards and Liueries, the woorthy Chancellour of
the Vniuersitie of Cambridge, and one of
her Maiesties most honorable
priuie Counsell.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">R</SEG>Ight Honorable, while I went
about to publish our English
Voyages and Discoueries, I
was aduised by master WAL∣TER
COPE, a gentleman of
rare and excellent parts, to
draw them into a short sum,
adding that in his opinion
that course woulde prooue
most acceptable to the world,
especially to men of great action and employment. Al∣though
in that worke then vnder the presse I could not
conueniently alter my course, yet holding his aduise, as in
many things else, so in this for sound and very good,
I heere present vnto your Honour a briefe Treatie
most agreeable to the same. The authour whereof was
<PB REF="3"/>
one <HI>Antonie Galuano,</HI> a Portugall gentleman: of whose
pietie towards God, equitie towards men, fidelity to his
Prince, loue to his countrey, skill in sea causes, experi∣ence
in Histories, liberalitie towards his nation, vigi∣lance,
valour, wisedome and diligence in restoring &amp; set∣ling
the decaied state of The Isles of Maluco, (where he
remained sixe or seuen yeeres gouernour,) if it please
your Honour to read <HI>Fernando Lopez de Castagneda,</HI> or
<HI>Ioannes Maffeius</HI> in their Histories of The East Indies,
you shall finde more written in his singular commendati∣on,
then a large Epistle can well comprehend.</P>
<P>The worke though s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all in bulke containeth so
much rare and profitable matter, as I know not where to
seeke the like, within so narrow and streite a compasse.
For heerein is orderly declared, who were The first Dis∣couerours
of the world since the time of the flood: by
what waies from age to age the spicerie, drugs, and riches
of the East were conueied into The West: what were the
causes of the alterations of those courses, as namely the
changes of Empires and gouernments: The ceasing of
all trafficke for many yeeres by The Gothes inuasion of
the Romane Empire: The rising vp of The Mahumetane
sect; with their ouerrunning of Afrike and Spaine: The
renewing againe, after many yeeres disturbance, of the
trafficke and entercourse of The East Indies; first by the
Califas of the aforesaid sect: and eftsoones by The Vene∣tians,
Ienowais and Florentines. Then followeth the ta∣king
of Ceuta in Barbarie by <HI>Iohn</HI> the first king of Portu∣gall
of that name in the yeere of our Lord 1415. whose
third sonne <HI>Don Henry</HI> (which he had by the vertuous La∣die
<HI>Philippa,</HI> daughter of <HI>Iohn</HI> of Gante, and sister to <HI>Henry</HI>
the fourth, king of England) was the first beginner of all
the Portugall discoueries, and continued the same for the
space of fortie and three yeeres euen to his dying day.
<PB REF="3"/>
By whose encouragement the kings of Portugall found
out with much patience and constancie the last way of
the bringing the Spicerie into Europe by The Cape of
Buona Sperança; and for these hundred yeeres past haue
become the chiefe Lords of the riches of the Orient By
emulation of which their good endeuours, The Antiles
and The west Indies began to be discouered by The kings
of Spaine. The infancies of both which most important
enterprises, The progresse of the same from time to time,
the discoueries of Islands, riuers, baies and harbours, of
many rich prouinces, kingdomes, and countries; The
erecting of castles in sundry conuenient Islands and pla∣ces,
with the drawing of trafficke vnto the same, where,
when, by whom, and by whose authority is heere succinct∣ly
and faithfully recorded. So that if it please your Ho∣nour
at your conuenient leisure to take a sea card or a
mappe of the world, and carie your eie vpon the coast of
Africa from Cape de Non, lying on the mayne in 29.
degrees of northerly latitude, and follow the shore about
the Cape of Buona Sperança till you come to the mouth
of The Redde Sea, and passing thence along by the coun∣trey
of Arabia crosse ouer to India, and doubling Cape
Comory compasse the gulfe of Bengala, &amp; shooting by
the citie of Malacca through The streite of Cincapura,
coast al the south of Asia to the northeast part of China,
and comprehend in this view all the Islands from The
Açores and Madera in the West, to The Malucoes,
The Philippinas, and Iapan in the East: you shall heere
finde by order, who were the first discouerours, conque∣rours
and planters in euery place: as also the natures
and commodities of the soyles, togither with the forces,
qualities, and conditions of the inhabitants. And that
which I mention of the Orient, is likewise to be vnder∣stood
of The Occident.</P>

Now touching the translation, it may please you sir, to
be aduertised that it was first done into our language by
some honest and well affected marchant of our nation,
whose name by no meanes I could attaine vnto, and
that as it seemeth many yeeres ago. For it hath lien by
me aboue these twelue yeeres. In all which space though
I haue made much inquirie, and sent to Lisbon, where
it seemeth it was printed, yet to this day I could neuer
obtaine the originall copie; whereby I might reforme
the manifold errours of the translator. For whereas a
good translator ought to be well acquainted with the
proprietie of the tongue out of which, and of that into
which he translateth, and thirdly with the subiect or mat∣ter
it selfe: I found this translator very defectiue in all
three; especially in the last. For the supplying of whose
defects I had none other remedie, but to haue recourse
vnto the originall histories, (which as it appeereth are
very many, and many of them exceeding rare and hard
to come by) out of which the authour himselfe drew the
greatest part of this discourse. And in very deede it cost
me more trauaile to search out the grounds thereof, and
to annexe the marginall quotations vnto the worke, then
the translation of many such bookes would haue put me
vnto. Of which quotations there is yet a farther vse; to
wit, that such as haue leasure sufficient, and are desirous to
reade these things more at large, (for breuitie oftentimes
breedeth obscuritie) may fully satisfie their desires by ha∣uing
recourse by the helpe therof to the pure fountaines,
out of which those waters which are drawne are for the
most part most sweete and holsome. Now if any man
shall maruel, that in these <HI>Discoueries</HI> of <HI>The World</HI> for the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pace almost of fower thousand yeeres here set downe,
our nation is scarce fower times mentioned: Hee is to
vnderstand, that when this authour ended this discourse,
<PB REF="4"/>
(which was about the yeere of Grace 1555.) there was
little extant of our mens trauailes. And for ought I can
see, there had no great matter yet come to light, if my
selfe had not vndertaken that heauie burden, being neuer
therein entertained to any purpose, vntill I had recourse
vnto your selfe, by whose speciall fauour and bountifull
patronage I haue been often much encouraged, and as it
were reuiued. Which trauailes of our men, because as
yet they be not come to ripenes, and haue been made for
the most part to places first discouered by others; when
they shall come to more perfection, and become more
profitable to the aduenturers, will then be more fit to be
reduced into briefe epitomes, by my selfe or some other
endued with an honest zeale of the honour of our coun∣trey.
In the meane season nothing doubting of your fa∣uourable
acceptation of this my labour, I humbly beseech
the authour of all goodnes to replenish and enrich you
with his best blessings, long to protect and preserue your
Honour to the profitable seruice of her Maiestie,
and to the common benefit and good
of the Realme. From London
this 29. of October

<HEAD>Francis de Sousa Tauares vnto the
high and mightie Prince Don
IOHN Duke of
Aueiro.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Ntonie Galuano</HI> vpon his death bed
left vnto me in his testament among
his papers this booke. And because
I am certaine he ordained it to bee
presented vnto your Grace, I haue
thought good herein to fulfill his wil
&amp; testament, though in other things
I haue done nothing, the fault remaining not in me. And
by all reason this treatie ought to be set foorth by a Por∣tugall,
seeing it intreateth of the variable waies from
whence the pepper and spices came in times past into
our partes, and also of all the nauigations and discoueries
in the old time: In both of which things the Portugals
haue most trauailed. In this treatie and in nine or ten
bookes of things touching Maluco and India (which the
Cardinall willed me to giue to <HI>Damian de Goes,</HI> saying
that he should content me, for otherwise I could not de∣liuer
them) this true Portugall occupied himselfe against
the vnfortunate and sorrow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ull times which he had been
in (which were all ended before all our daies and times:)<NOTE PLACE="marg">Antonie Gal∣uano Captaine of Maluco.</NOTE>
for when he receiued the captainship and fortresses of
Maluco, all the kings and gouernours of all the Ilands
about being agreed to make war against the Portugals,
vntill such time as they might driue them all out of the
countrey, he fought against them all▪ with onely 130. Por∣tugals,
when they were all together, and strong in Tidore;
and he gaue them the ouerthrow and killed their king, and
one <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ernate,</HI> the principal author of that war, and he tooke
<PB REF="6"/>
from them their fortresse: so vpon this victorie they sub∣mitted
themselues, and came vnder the obeisance and ser∣uice
of our king of Portugall. Herein two things happe∣ned
of great admiration▪ The first, that all the kings and
gouernours of Maluco agreed togither against vs, a thing
that neuer fell out, nor yet credible to be like to happen:
for they are euer at variance among themselues:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Variance vsu∣ally amon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the kings of Ma∣luco.</NOTE> The se∣cond,
that the captaine of Maluco with onely his ordina∣rie
soldiers should haue the victorie against so many be∣ing
all together. For sometimes it happeneth that some
of the captaines of Maluco with many extraordinarie
soldiers besides their ordinarie, yea and with the aide of
al the Kings and Lords of Maluco in their fauour and aide
went against one King onely of them, and came backe
againe with losse. So there may be reckoned three notable
things done in India, I say of qualitie: (but of more quan∣titie
<MILESTONE N="1"/> and importance there haue been others:) which were
<MILESTONE N="2"/> the taking of Muar by <HI>Emmanuel Falcon,</HI> and the winning
<MILESTONE N="3"/> of Bitam by <HI>Peter Mascarenas,</HI> and this, whereof we pre∣sently
treate. For all these three deedes seemed to be im∣possible
to be atchieued, considering the small quantitie
of soldiers which the captaines had in giuing the enter∣prise
against so many; with the order and maner by them
ordained how and which waies to obtaine their purpose
as well by their enimies as by themselues. And they could
not be atchieued otherwise but by vsing a meane and or∣der
not thought of at the first by the Portugals, nor yet
euer suspected by their enimies. And, besides this, his fa∣ther
and fower of his brethren were all slaine in the kings
seruice: And he now being the last of his linage, caried
with him into Maluco woorth ten thousand crusadoes,
which he spent not in idlenes, nor yet in play, but onely in
bringing of many kings and innumerable townes vnto
our holy faith, and in the preseruing of Maluco, employ∣ing
all his power and strength that all the cloues might
<PB REF="6"/>
come vnto the hands of the kings highnes: which with
Maluco yeelded vnto him euery yeere fiue hundred thou∣sand
crusadoes; being all to his great preiudice, let, and
hinderance. For if he had gathered cloues for himselfe,
as the captaines of Maluco haue done and doe, then he
had come home very rich. But when he came home into
Portugall in great hope (such is the simplicitie of the
best natures) to be rewarded for his good seruice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Good seruice full ill re∣warded.</NOTE> and to
be more fauoured and honored, then if he had brought
home with him an hundred thousand crusadoes, he was
greatly deceiued. For he found neither fauour, nor yet ho∣nor,
but onely among the poore and miserable, to wit, in
an hospitall: where he was kept seuenteene yeeres vntill
the hower of his death; and there he had allowed vnto
him his winding sheete to burie him in: and the brother∣hood
of the Couent prepared for his buriall as for a
poore courtier cast off by all men, leauing himselfe indeb∣ted
in two thousand crusadoes, whereof part came out of
India, and part thereof many of his friends had lent him
to maintaine him in the hospitall: for in all these seuen∣teene
yeeres he had not of his highnes for to helpe him∣selfe
with so much as one riall of plate, nor yet I of the
bookes which I deliuered receiued any thing to discharge
his will with. Yet for all this, euen as vpon the prosperitie
of his victories he neuer made any boast, so likewise in his
aduersities his great stomacke did nothing abate his hart.
As there are good proofes that with so many and so con∣tinuall
disgraces as he suffered, he neuer vnto the hower
of his death left off to raise and to augment the yeerely
rent vnto a Counto:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Counto is 50000. cru∣sadoes.</NOTE> which some made strange and would
not giue eare vnto: So that euen as he was extreme pain∣full
in the performance of his seruice, so he was the like
in the things sounding vnto the perfecting of the same,
which was the cause that he was brought vnto the state
that he died in. For he could not see the qualitie of the
<PB REF="7"/>
time, but onely those of his great seruice, by reason of the
great charges that it stood him in. And his saying was,
That he was borne, not for to say that his constellation
was in the wars victorious, but in the ouercomming of
kings by the arte of warfare, readines in resoluing, pru∣dence
in conseruing, and great loialtie and patience with
many seruices vnto his king and master. In which of all
these he had most contentation it cannot easily be deter∣mined.
Wherefore your noble Grace may see, that this
treatie and the others were made with sighes and afflicti∣ons
which his inferiour will might haue raised vp in him
against his superiour reason. Neither was he willing to
take for his remedie that which that great Turke <HI>Zelim</HI>
sonne to the great <HI>Mahumet</HI> did, (for he tooke Constan∣tinople
and died in Rome) who vsed to make himselfe
drunke, because he would not remember the great estate
which he lost: nor yet woulde he giue eare vnto those
things which many of his friends would tell him, wishing
he would settle his mind out of the kingdome: (for other∣wise
he should neuer be able to liue:) whereunto he an∣swered,
that in this point he would rather be compared
vnto the great <HI>Timocles</HI> the Athenian,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Or rather The∣mistocles.</NOTE> then to be like the
excellent Romane <HI>Coriolanus.</HI> Which is a goodly exam∣ple
of a true and faithfull Portugall. (Though it were not
so as I doe say, yet I doe heare, that the hospitals be full of
the most faithfull subiects to their prince and countrey.)
Wherefore by all reason this treatie ought to be of your
Grace fauoured, setting apart all ouersights, if there be
any, in this worke, of the author: I being not able to
attaine vnto the vnderstanding of the con∣trary.
God prosper your Grace with
long life and increase of
honour.</P>

<HEAD>An excellent Treatise of ANTONIE
GALVANO Portugall, containing the
most ancient and moderne discoueries of the
world especially by nauigation, according to
the course of times from the flood
vntill the yeere of grace
1555.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hile I had a desire to gather to∣gether
some olde and some new
discoueries, which haue béene
made by sea and by land, with
their iust times and situations;
they séemed to be two things of
so great difficultie, that being
cōfused in the authors of them,
I determined once to desist frō
any such purpose. For touching
the course of time the <HI>Herbre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es</HI>
declare, that from the beginning of the world to the flood were
1656. yéeres. The Seuentie Interpreters make mention of
2242.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Augustine de C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t. Dei, lib. 15. cap. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0.</NOTE> And S. <HI>Augustine</HI> reckoneth 2262. In the situations
likewise there be many differences. For there neuer sailed
together in one fleete at sea from ten pilots to the number of
100. but that some of them found themselues by reckoning
in one longitude and other some in another. But considering
better with my selfe, that the difficulties are open<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, and the
differences amended by others of more exact iudgement and
vnderstanding therein, I purposed notwithstanding to pro∣céede
in this worke of <HI>Discoueries.</HI></P>
<P>Some there be that say, that the world hath fully béene
discouered: and they alleage this reason, that as it hath b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ene
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
peopled and inhabited, so it might be frequented, and naui∣gable,
and the rather for that the men in that age were of a
longer life, and of lawes and languages almost one.</P>
<P>There be others of a contrarie opinion to this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Contrarie opi∣nions touching the discouerie of the world.</NOTE> holding
that all the earth could not be knowne, nor the people con∣uersant
one with another. For though it had béene so once,
yet the same would haue beene lost againe by the malice of
men, and the want of iustice among the inhabitants of the
earth. But bicause the best and most famous discoueries were
made by sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who were the first discouerers since the flood.</NOTE> and that principally in our times, I desire to
knowe, who were <HI>the first Discouerers since the time of the
flood.</HI></P>
<P>Some affirme that they were the Gréekes, others say, the
Phoenicians, others also the Egyptians. The people of India
agrée not hereunto; affirming that they were the first that
sailed by sea: namely the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The people of China say they were the first sailers by sea.</NOTE> <HI>Tabencos,</HI> which now we call the
<HI>Chinois.</HI> And they alleage for the proofe of this, that they be
y<SUP>e</SUP> Lords of the <HI>Indiaes</HI> euen vnto the Cape of <HI>Bona Sperança,</HI>
&amp; the island of <HI>S. Laurence,</HI> which is inhabited by them▪ and al
along the sea; as also the <HI>Iauaes, Timores, Celebes, Maca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ares,
Malucos, Borneos, Mindanaos, Luçones, Lequeos, Iapones,</HI>
and other Islands being many in number, and the firme
lands of <HI>Cauchin-China, Laos, Bramas, Pegu, Arracones,</HI> till
you come vnto <HI>Bengala:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The inhabitants of the West In∣dies descended from China.</NOTE> And besides this, <HI>New Spaine, Peru,
Brasill,</HI> the <HI>Antiles,</HI> with the rest adioining vnto them, as ap∣péereth
by the fashions and maners of the men and women,
and by their proportions, hauing small eies, flat noses, with
other proportions to be seene. And to this day many of these
Ilands and countreies are called by the names of <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tochina,
Bocho-China,</HI> which is as much to say, as the countreies of
<HI>China.</HI> Further it appeereth by histories, that the arke of <HI>Noe</HI>
rested vpon the north parts of the mountaines of <HI>Armenia,</HI>
which stands in 40. degrées and vpwards: and that imme∣diately
thereupon <HI>Scythia</HI> was first peopled, for that it is an
high land, and appéered first after the flood. And séeing the pro∣uince
and countrey of the <HI>Taben<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>os</HI> is one of the chiefest of
all <HI>Tartarie,</HI> as they report, it is to be thought that they were
of the most ancient inhabitants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The seas be∣tweene the Tro∣picks very calm.</NOTE> and men of the most ancient
nauigations, the seas being as calme as the riuers be in those
parts lying betwéene the Tropicks, where the daies and
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
nights do not much differ, as well in the howers, as in y<SUP>e</SUP> tem∣perature:
where there blow no outragious windes, to cause
the waters to rise or to be troubled. And by late experience it
is sound,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An high bough in steed of mast and saile.</NOTE> that the small barks wherein they saile haue onely
a great high bough in the middest of the barke, standing in

along the coast; and the rest of the passengers sit onely vpon
certaine poles, which are fastened in the barke, which they
call <HI>Catamarones,</HI> and so they passe without rowing.</P>
<P>It is further said, that the people of <HI>China</HI> were somtimes
Lords of the most part of <HI>Scythia,</HI> and sailed ordinarily along
that coast, which séemeth to reach vnto 70. degrées toward
the north.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pomponius Mela lib. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Cornelius Nepos</HI> is the author of this; who parti∣cularly
affirmeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plinius lib. 2. cap 67.</NOTE> that in the time that <HI>Metellus</HI> the fellowe
Consul of <HI>Afranius,</HI> was Proconsul in France, the king of
<HI>Sue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia</HI> sent vnto him certaine Indians, which came thither
in a ship from this countrey, comming by the north and by
the flats of Germanie. And it is probable that they were peo∣ple
of <HI>China,</HI> for that they from 20. 30. and 40. degrees vp∣wards
haue strong ships and clynchers, that can well brooke
the seas, and indure the cold and intemperature of such nor∣therly
regions. As for <HI>Cambaia</HI> there is shipping also in it,
and the people by report haue vsed the seas many yéeres:
but it seemeth not that they were any of them which came
into France: for that they trafficke onely to <HI>Cairo,</HI> and are
men in déed of little trafficke and lesse clothing.</P>
<P>As for those which escaped the destruction of the flood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioseph. Antiouit. Iudai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lib. 1. ca. 5.</NOTE> they
were therewith so amazed, that they durst not descend into
the plaines and lowe countreies, but kept the hils. And we
reade of <HI>Nimrode,</HI> who 130. yéeres after the flood built the
<HI>Tower of Babell,</HI> intending thereby to saue himselfe, if there
should come any more such floods.</P>
<P>Therefore it seemeth, that they which first came to be sai∣lers
were those which dwell in the east in the prouince of
<HI>China:</HI> although others contrariwise hold them which dwell
in the west as in <HI>Syria,</HI> to haue vsed the trade of the sea soonest
after the flood. But this contention about the antiquitie of
nauigation I leaue to the Scythians and Egyptians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iustinus lib. 1.</NOTE> who
were at great variance and difference in this matter; for each
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
of them chalenged vnto themselues the honour of the first sea
trauaile. But omitting all iars and differences thereabouts,
I will apply my selfe to my purposed discourse, and speake of
that which histories haue left in record.</P>
<P>THere be some wel séene in Antiquities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bero<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us.</NOTE> which say that
in the 143. yéere after the flood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first nauiga∣tion after the flood 143.</NOTE> <HI>Tubal</HI> came by sea into
Spaine, whereby it séemeth that in those times naui∣gations
were vsed into our parts out of Ethiopia.</P>
<P>And they also say farther, that not long after this, the
Quéene <HI>Semyramis</HI> went against the Indians in that riuer
wherof they tooke their name,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diodorus Siculus lib. 2. cap. 5.</NOTE> and therein gaue battaile vnto
the king <HI>Stabrobates,</HI> wherin he lost a thousand ships. Which
being credible by the ancient historie, prooueth manifestly
that in those parts, in those times were many ships, and the
seas frequented in good numbers.</P>
<P>In the 650. yéere after the flood there was a king in Spaine
named <HI>Hesperus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Berosus.</NOTE> who in his time as it is reported went and
discouered as far as <HI>Cape Verde,</HI> &amp; the Island of <HI>S. Thomas,</HI>
whereof he was prince:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gonsaluo Fer∣nandes de Ouie∣do lib. 2. cap 3. Generalis H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st.</NOTE> And <HI>Gonsaluo Fernandes</HI> of <HI>Ouiedo</HI>
the Chronicler of Antiquities affirmeth, that in his time the
Islands of the <HI>West Indies</HI> were discouered, and called some∣what
after his name <HI>He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>perides:</HI> and he alleageth many
reasons to prooue it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plinius lib. 6. cap. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> reporting particularly that in 40. daies
they sailed from <HI>Cape Verde</HI> vnto those Islands.</P>
<P>There are others that say that the like was done from this
Cape vnto the Islands of <HI>S. Thomas,</HI> and the Isle <HI>De Prin∣cipe,</HI>
and that they be the <HI>Hesperides,</HI> and not the <HI>An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iles:</HI>
And they doe not differ far from reason:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ancient nauigation was along the coast, and not far into the maine O∣cean.</NOTE> seeing in those times
and many yeeres after they did vse to saile onely along the
coast, not passing through the maine Ocean sea: for they had
neither altitude nor compasse then in vse, nor any mariners
so expert.</P>
<P>It cannot be denied, but that there were many countries,
Islands, Capes Is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hmos and points which now are grown
out of knowledge;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Length of time <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1+ words" DISP="〈◊…〉"/> of wa∣ters have much altered the situa∣tion of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> places.</NOTE> because the names of them are found in
histories. But the age of the world and force of waters haue
w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sted and consumed them, and separated one countrey from
another, both in <HI>Europe, Asia, Af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ica, New Spaine, Peru,</HI> and
other places.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="9"/>
<HI>Plato</HI> saith in his dialogue of <HI>Timaeus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plato in Timaeo.</NOTE> that there were in
ancient times in the Ocean sea Atlanticke certaine great
Islands and countries named <HI>Atlantides</HI> greater then <HI>Afrike</HI>
and <HI>Europe:</HI> and that the kings of those parts were Lords of
a great part of this our countrey: but with certaine great
tempests the sea did ouerflow it, and it remained as mud and
shingle; so that in a long time after no ships could passe that
way.</P>
<P>It is also recorded in histories,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plinius lib. 4. cap. 22.</NOTE> that fast by the Island of
<HI>Cadiz</HI> towards the Straights of <HI>Gibraltar</HI> there was a cer∣taine
Island which was called <HI>Aphrodisias,</HI> well inhabited
and planted with many gardens and orchards, and yet at
this day we haue no knowledge of this <HI>Aphrodisias,</HI> but only
a bare mention of it in ancient authors. The said Island of
<HI>Cadiz</HI> is further said to haue béen so large and big, that it did
ioine with the firme land of Spaine.</P>
<P>The Islands of the <HI>Açores</HI> were sometimes a point of the
mountaines of <HI>Estrella,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Islands of the Açores som∣times ioined to the firme land.</NOTE> which ioine vnto the sea ouer the

mountaine, which adioineth vnto the water, hard by the citie
of <HI>Sasin</HI> in the land of <HI>Cucu</HI> (which is the selfe same Island of
<HI>Mouchin,</HI> where <HI>Algarbe</HI> is) come the Islands of <HI>Porto San∣to</HI>
and <HI>Madera.</HI></P>
<P>For it is held as a true and vndoubted veritie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Islands haue their rootes run∣ning from the maine land.</NOTE> that all
Islands haue their roots running from the firme land, though
they be neuer so farre from the continent: for otherwise they
could not stand firme.</P>
<P>There are other histories which say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eratosthenes apud Strabonem lib. 1. pag. 26.</NOTE> that from <HI>Spaine</HI> vn∣to
<HI>Ceuta</HI> in <HI>Barbarie</HI> men sometimes trauailed on foote vpon
drie land, and that the Islands of <HI>Sardinia</HI> and <HI>Corsica</HI> did
ioine the one with the other, as also did <HI>Sicilia</HI> with <HI>Italie,</HI>
and <HI>Negroponto</HI> with <HI>Graecia.</HI></P>
<P>We reade also that there were found hulles of ships,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Huls of ships and ankers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound on mountaines f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rre within land.</NOTE> an∣kers
of iron, and other memorials of shipping vpon the
mountaines of <HI>Sussa</HI> farre within the land: where as it
seemeth now no salt water or sea euer came.</P>
<P>In <HI>India</HI> also, and in the land of <HI>Malabar,</HI> although now
there be great store of people, yet many writers affirme that
it was once a maine sea vnto the foote of the mountaines; and
that the Cape of <HI>Comarim,</HI> and the Island of <HI>Zeilan</HI> were all
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
one thing: As also that the Island of <HI>Samatra</HI> did ioine with
the land of <HI>Malacca</HI> by the flats of <HI>Caypasia;</HI> and not farre
frō thence there stands now a little Island, which few yéeres
past was part of the firme land that is ouer against it.</P>
<P>Furthermore it is to be séene, how <HI>Ptolemey</HI> in his tables
dot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> set the land of <HI>Malacca</HI> to the south of the line in thrée or
fower degrées of latitude, whereas now it is at the point
thereof, being called <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entana,</HI> in one degrée on the north side,
as appéereth in the Straight of <HI>Cincapura,</HI> where daily they
doe passe through vnto the coast of <HI>Sian</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> where the
Island of <HI>Aynan</HI> standeth, which also they say did ioine hard
to the land of <HI>China:</HI> and <HI>Ptolemey</HI> placeth it on the north
side far from the line, standing now aboue 20. degrées from it
towards the north, as <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Europe</HI> now stand.</P>
<P>Well it may be that in time past the land of <HI>Malacca</HI> and
<HI>China</HI> did end beyond the line on the south side, as <HI>Ptolemey</HI>
doth set them foorth: because it might ioine with the point of
the land called <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entana,</HI> with the Islands of <HI>Bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tan, Banca,</HI> &amp;
<HI>Salitres</HI> being many that waies, &amp; the land might be all slime
&amp; oaze; And so y<SUP>e</SUP> point of <HI>China,</HI> might ioine with the Islands
of the <HI>Luçones, Borneos, Lequeos, Mindanaos,</HI> &amp; others which
stand in this parallele: they also as yet hauing in opinion that
the Island of <HI>Samatra</HI> did ioine with <HI>Iaua</HI> by the chanell of
<HI>Sunda,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">At this Isle of Bali the Hol∣la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ders were 1596. and haue largely descri∣bed it.</NOTE> and the Islands of <HI>Bali, Aujaue, çambaua, Solor, Ho∣galeao,
Maulua, Vintara, Rosalaguin,</HI> and others that be in
this parallele and altitude did all ioine with <HI>Iaua;</HI> and so they
séeme outwardly to those that descrie them. For at this day
the Islands stand so néere the one to the other, that they séeme
all but one firme land; and whosoeuer passeth betwéene some
of them, may touch with their hand the boughs of the trées on
the one and on the other side also. And to come néerer to the
matter, it is not long since, that in the east the Islands of <HI>Ban∣da</HI>
were diuers of them ouerflowen and drowned by the sea:
And so likewise in <HI>China</HI> about nine score miles of firme
ground is now become a lake,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nine score miles of firme ground lately drowned in China.</NOTE> as it is reported. Which is not
to be thought maruellous; considering that which <HI>Ptolemey▪</HI>
and others haue written in such cases; which here I omit, to
returne to my purpose.</P>
<P>After the flood 800. yéeres we reade that the citie of <HI>Troy</HI>
was builded by the <HI>Dardans;</HI> and that before that time they
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
brought out of the <HI>Indies</HI> into <HI>Europe</HI> by the <HI>Red sea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">800. yeeres after the flood was trade of spices by the Red sea.</NOTE> spices,
drugs, and many other kindes of marchandises, which were
there more abundant, then now they be. Whereunto if credit
may be giuen, we may conceaue that the sea was of old haun∣ted
and frequented, séeing that then they of the East had so
much and so great trafficke with them of the West, that they
brought their marchandise vnto an hauen which was named
<HI>Arsinoe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arsinoe, now called Suez.</NOTE> being that which at this day is called <HI>Suez,</HI> standing
in 30. degrées on the north part of the <HI>Arabian</HI> Gulfe. It
is also by authors farther written, that from this hauen of
<HI>Arsinoe</HI> or <HI>Suez,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plinius lib. 6. cap. 29.</NOTE> these marchandises were carried by Cara∣uans
or great companies of carriers vpon camels, asses, and
mules, vnto the Leuant sea vnto a city called <HI>Cassou,</HI> standing
on the coast in 32. degrées of latitude, yeelding vnto euery
degrée 17. leagues and an halfe, as the maner is. And there
are by account from the one sea to the other 35. leagues, or
105. miles.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strabo lib. 17. pag. 560.</NOTE> These carriers, by reason of the heate of the coun∣trey,
trauailed in the night onely, directing themselues by
stars and by marks of postes and canes, which they vsed to
sticke in the ground as they went. But after that, because this
course and iourney had many inconueniences, they changed
and altered the same twise, to finde out the most commodious
way.</P>
<P>900. yéeres or there about after the flood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">900. yeeres after the flood.</NOTE> and before the
destruction of <HI>Troy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strabo lib. 17.</NOTE> there was a king in <HI>Egypt</HI> called <HI>Seso∣stris,</HI>
who perceiuing that the former courses and passages for
the carrying of marchandises by men &amp; beasts, were chargea∣ble
to the one &amp; most painfull to the other, prouided to haue a
way or streame cut out of the land from the <HI>Red sea</HI> vnto an
arme of the riuer <HI>Nilus</HI> which rūneth vnto the <HI>Citie Heroum;</HI>
that by the meanes thereof ships might passe and repasse
with their marchandises from <HI>India</HI> into <HI>Europe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plinius lib. 6. cap. 29.</NOTE> and not
be discharged till they came into <HI>Italie.</HI> So that this <HI>Sesostris</HI>
was the first king, which built great caracks to trauaile this
way. But this enterprise for all that tooke little effect. For if
it had, <HI>Africa</HI> had then béen made as an Island all compassed
with water, being no more ground betweene sea and sea, then
the space of 20. leagues or 60. miles.</P>
<P>About this time the <HI>Graecians</HI> gathered together an army
or fléete,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diodorus Siculus lib. 4. cap. 4.</NOTE> which now is called <HI>Argonautica,</HI> whereof <HI>Iason</HI> and
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
<HI>Alceus</HI> were captains general. Some say they went from the
Isle of <HI>Creta,</HI> others from <HI>Graecia.</HI> But whence soeuer they
departed, they sailed through the <HI>Proponticke</HI> sea, and <HI>Saint
Georges</HI> Sleeue vnto the <HI>Euxine</HI> sea, where some perished,
and <HI>Iason</HI> thereupon returned backe into <HI>Greece. Alceus</HI> re∣ported
that he was driuen with a tempest to the lake <HI>Maeo∣tis,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The lake Maeo∣tis.</NOTE> where he was forsaken of al his company, and they which

<P><HI>Strabo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strabo lib. 1. pag 26.</NOTE> alleaging <HI>Aristonicus</HI> the Grammarian, sheweth
that after the destruction of <HI>Troy Menelaus</HI> the king came out
of the straights of the Leuant seas into the sea <HI>Atlanticke</HI> and
coasted <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Guinea,</HI> and doubled the Cape of <HI>Bona

of his there may be many more particulars gathered out of
the histories. This <HI>Mediterrane</HI> sea was also sometimes cal∣led
<HI>The Adriaticke, The Aegaean,</HI> and the <HI>Herculean sea,</HI> with
other names, according to the lands, coasts &amp; Islands which
it passeth by, running into the great sea <HI>Atlanticke,</HI> along the
coast of <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>In the yéere 1300. after the flood <HI>Solomon</HI> caused a nauie
to be prepared on the Red sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. of Kings. 9.</NOTE> at an hauen called <HI>Ezeon Ge∣ber,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Chron. 8.</NOTE> to saile to the <HI>East India,</HI> where by opinion stande the
Islands called <HI>Tharsis</HI> and <HI>Ophir.</HI> This nauie was thrée
yéeres on this voyage, and then returned, and brought with
them gold, siluer, cypres, &amp;c. Whereby it séemeth that those
places, and Islands were those, which now be called the <HI>Lu∣çones,
Lequeos,</HI> and <HI>Chinaes.</HI> For we know few other parts
from whence some of those things are brought, or wherein
nauigation was so long since vsed.</P>
<P>It is left vs also in histories,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herodotus lib. 4.</NOTE> that a king of <HI>Egypt</HI> called
<HI>Neco,</HI> desiring greatly to ioyne the <HI>Red sea</HI> with the riuer
<HI>Nilus,</HI> commanded the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> to saile from the straight
of <HI>Mecca</HI> to the farther end of the <HI>Mediterrane</HI> sea, to sée if it
did make any turne backe againe vnto <HI>Egypt.</HI> Which com∣mandement
they obeied, sailing towards the south all along
the coast and countrey of <HI>Melinde, Quiloa, Sofala,</HI> till they
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
came to the Cape of <HI>Bona Esperança,</HI> finding the sea continu∣ally
on the left hand: But when they had doubled the Cape,
and found the coast continually on the right hand, they mar∣uailed
much at it. Notwithstanding they continued their
course forward toward the north al along the coast of <HI>Guiney</HI>
and the <HI>Mediterrane sea,</HI> till they came backe againe into
<HI>Egypt,</HI> whence they first went out. In which discouerie they
remained two yéeres. And these are thought to be the first,
that compassed by sea all the coast of <HI>Afrike,</HI> and sailed round
about it.</P>
<P>In the yéere 590. before the incarnation of Christ there
went out of <HI>Spaine</HI> a fléete of <HI>Carthaginian</HI> marchants vpon
their owne proper costs and charges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aristoteles lib. de mirandis in natu∣ra auditis.</NOTE> which sailed toward
the west through the high seas to sée if they could finde any
land: and they sailed so farre, that they found at last the
Islands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gonzalo Fer∣nandes de Quie∣do lib. 2 cap. 3. of his generall hi∣storie.</NOTE> which we now call the <HI>Antiles</HI> and <HI>Noua Spagna:</HI>
which <HI>Gonzalo Fernandes de Quiedo</HI> saith were then disco∣uered,
although <HI>Christopher Columbus</HI> afterwards by his
trauaile got more exact knowledge of them, and hath left vs
an euident notice where they be. But all these historians,
which wrote of these <HI>Antiles</HI> before, as of doubtfull and vn∣certaine
things, and of places vndiscouered, doe now plainly
confesse the same to be the countrey of <HI>Noua Spagna.</HI></P>
<P>In the yéere 520. before the incarnation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diodorus Siculus lib. 1. cap. 3.</NOTE> and after the set∣ting
out of the aforesaid army, <HI>Cambyses</HI> king of <HI>Persia</HI> tooke
<HI>Egypt,</HI> after whom succéeded <HI>Darius</HI> the sonne of <HI>Histaspis,</HI>
and he determined to make an end of the enterprise which
king <HI>Sesostris</HI> had begun, if they had not told him that the <HI>Red
sea</HI> was higher then the land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and that by meanes
of the salt sea comming into the riuer <HI>Nilus,</HI> all the prouince
would haue béen lost and vndone for hunger and thirst. For
the fresh water of the riuer <HI>Nilus</HI> doth ouerflowe the whole
countrey, and the inhabitants haue no other water then that
for their drinke: whereupon he left his first purpose of pro∣secuting
that enterprise.</P>
<P>Now by the way I shall not swarue much from my mat∣ter,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A digression.</NOTE> if I speake a word or two of some things incident to this
discourse.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plinius lib. 9. cap. 58. de mu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ibus Nili.</NOTE> The <HI>Egyptians</HI> say that they had in their countrey
certaine vermine like vnto rats, whereof many be halfe like
earth and the other halfe like a vermine. One kinde of them
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
kéepe the water, and another kinde the land. For my part I
thinke that these be they, which breake the serpents egges,
whereof there are many in the riuer <HI>Nilus,</HI> which also be cal∣led
Crocodiles: which in times past by report were so in∣chanted,
that thereby they could not hurt any person. But
when they were deliuered from their inchantment made by
the <HI>Egyptians</HI> arte,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioannes Leo Africanus lib. 9. cap. de Nilo.</NOTE> and letters, then they endeuoured to kill
people, wilde beasts and cattell, doing very much harme, spe∣cially
those which liue in the water, which oftentimes come
to the land, and liuing altogether on land become very strong
poison. The people beyond the citie of <HI>Cairo</HI> vse to fish for
them and eate them, and they take their heads, and set them
vpon the walles of their citie.</P>
<P>Of these Crocodiles it is written,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plinius lib. 8. cap. 25.</NOTE> that they lay themselues
along by the riuer with their mouthes open, and that there
come vnto them certaine white birds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ioannes Leo Africanus lib. 9.</NOTE> litle bigger then thrus∣shes,
which flie into the mouth of the Crocodile, and picke out
the filthines which is betwéene his téeth, and in his iawes,
wherewith he is greatly pleased; but for all that the Croco∣dile
would close his mouth and deuoure the bird, if nature
had not prouided the bird a sharpe pricke as it were, grow∣ing
out of his head, wherewith he pricketh the Crocodile in
the mouth; which causeth him to gape wide, and so the bird
flieth away without harme; yet there come by and by other
of those birds, which make an end of cleansing his mouth.</P>
<P>In the same riuer there are also many beastes like vnto
horses;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hippopotami.</NOTE> and vpon the land certaine fowles like vnto cranes,
which warre continually with serpents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibis.</NOTE> that come thither
from <HI>Arabia,</HI> and kill many of them. Which birds as also the
vermine, which eate the egges of the Crocodiles, are greatly
estéemed of the <HI>Egyptians.</HI></P>
<P>But now to returne to my matter, and to procéede in the
discoueries; In the yéere 485. before the incarnation of Christ
<HI>Xerxes</HI> the king of <HI>Persia</HI> commanded <HI>Sataspis</HI> his nephew to
goe and search, and discouer <HI>India:</HI> who according to the pre∣cept
vndertooke the voyage, and went through the straight of
<HI>Gibraltar,</HI> and passed the promontorie of <HI>Africa,</HI> which now
we call the Cape of <HI>Bona Sperança,</HI> standing southward be∣twixt

vnto this Island, where the day hath in Iune 22. houres, and

<P>Now the other brother <HI>Hanno</HI> tooke his course towarde

they went along by it vnto another Cape named <HI>Aromati∣cum,</HI>
which is now called <HI>Guardafu,</HI> standing southeast from
Cape <HI>Verde</HI> in 14. degrées toward the north; and he came
to the coast of <HI>Arabia</HI> standing in 16. and 17. degrées; and
was fiue yéeres in this voiage, before he returned backe into
<HI>Spaine.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The nauigation of Hanno in Greeke here∣vnto agreeth.</NOTE> There be others that say, that he passed not beyond

he spent so much time in his trauaile. It is reported that
the inhabitants of the Cape of <HI>Bona Sperança</HI> are great wit∣ches,

such seruice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Enchanted snakes.</NOTE> and commandement, that they kéepe their Chur∣ches

as well from wilde beasts, as from théeues. For if they see any
to doe or to intend hurt, the snake windes her selfe to him or
them, holding them as prisoners, and commanding her yoong
ones to call their masters vntill they be taken. If the théeues
be many, or the wilde beastes of so much strength, that they
dare not meddle with them, then they goe vnto the house of
him with whom they doe liue: and if it be in the night time,
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
they giue so many strokes, that at the last they doe awake
them, to cause them to prouide for their defence.</P>
<P>A certaine <HI>Italian</HI> called <HI>Aloisius Cadamusta</HI> writeth, that
he being in the discouerie of <HI>Guiney</HI> in the kingdome of <HI>Bu∣dimol</HI>
lay in the house of <HI>Bisborol</HI> his sonnes sonne; and lying
in his bed he heard a great noise and many blowes giuen
about the house; whereupon <HI>Bisborol</HI> rose, and went out: and
when he came againe, <HI>Cadamusta</HI> demanded of him, where
he had béen; and he answered that he had béen with his Co∣bras
or snakes which called him. In the <HI>Indias</HI> there be many
of these kinde of snakes, and some full of poison, which not∣withstanding
the <HI>Indian</HI> people vse to carrie about their
necks, and put them into their bosomes and vnder their
armes: which at some soundes that the people make will
daunce, and doe diuers things at commandement.</P>
<P>There was a <HI>Portugall</HI> that somtime told me, that beyond
the Cape of <HI>Bona Sperança</HI> towards <HI>Sofala, Quiloa,</HI> and
<HI>Melinde,</HI> where he had béen, there were certaine birds, which
would come to the <HI>Black Moores</HI> at their call,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Odericus writeth the like of one that brought multitudes of patridges to Trapezunda.</NOTE> and according
as the <HI>Moores</HI> did remooue, so the birds would doe, from one
trée to another: and they vsed to follow them till they did
light vpon some trée, from whence they could not remooue.
And as the <HI>Negros</HI> went vp the trée they should finde waxe
and honie thereupon, not knowing whether it grewe there
naturally or not. In the same countrey also vnder ground in
Ant-holes they did finde much honie and waxe, which the
Antes did make, being somewhat bitter. Vpon the sea coast
also they found certaine fishes, which commonly went vp∣right
in the water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mermaides.</NOTE> hauing the faces and natures of women,
which the fishermen of those places were acquainted with.</P>
<P>In the yéere 355. before Christ it is said that the <HI>Spanyards</HI>

caried diuers marchandises, which trade they vsed in great
ships. And sailing to the northwest they came vnto certaine
flats, which with the flowing of the sea were couered, and
with the ebbe were discouered, finding there many Tunnies
of great bignes, where they commonly vsed to fish them to
their great profit, because they were the first vntill that time
that they had séene, and were greatly esteemed.</P>

The time of <HI>Alexander Magnus,</HI> as appiereth by the ages
of the world, was before the comming of Christ 324. yéeres:
we all know that he was borne in <HI>Europe:</HI> but he trauailed
into <HI>Asia</HI> &amp; <HI>Africa,</HI> and passed through <HI>Armenia, Assyria, Per∣sia,</HI>
&amp; <HI>Bactria,</HI> standing northerly in 44. degrées of latitude,
which is the farthest countrey in longitude wherein he was
in all his iourneyes. From thence he descended into <HI>India</HI> by
the mountaines of <HI>Imaus,</HI> and the valleyes of <HI>Paropanisus,</HI>
and prepared a nauie in the riuer <HI>Indus,</HI> and therewith passed
into the <HI>Ocean</HI> sea, where he turned by the lands of <HI>Gedrosia,
Caramania,</HI> &amp; <HI>Persia,</HI> vnto the great citie of <HI>Babylon,</HI> leauing
<HI>Onesicritus</HI> and <HI>Nearcus</HI> captaines of his fléete, which after∣wards
came vnto him by the straight of the <HI>Persian</HI> sea, and
vp the riuer of <HI>Euphrates,</HI> leauing that countrey and coast
discouered.</P>
<P>After this, <HI>Ptolemey</HI> raigned king of <HI>Egypt,</HI> who by some
is reputed to haue béen bastard sonne vnto <HI>Philip</HI> father of
the foresaid <HI>Alexander</HI> the great.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plinius lib. 6. cap. 29.</NOTE> This <HI>Ptolemey</HI> imitating
the forenamed kings <HI>Sesostris</HI> aud <HI>Darius,</HI> made a trench or
ditch of an hundred foote broad and of thirty foote déepe, and
ten or twelue leagues in length till he came to <HI>The bitter
Welles,</HI> pretending to haue his worke run into the sea from
a mouth of the riuer <HI>Nilus,</HI> called <HI>Pelusium,</HI> passing now by
the citie <HI>Damiata.</HI> But this thing tooke none effect: for that
the <HI>Red sea</HI> was thought to be higher by thrée cubits then the
land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> which would haue ouerflowed all the coun∣trey,
to the ruine and losse thereof.</P>
<P>In the yéere 277.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strabo lib 17. pag. 560 &amp; 561.</NOTE> before the incarnation succéeded in the
gouernment of the kingdome one <HI>Philadelphus,</HI> who brought
to passe that the marchandises should come out of <HI>Europe</HI> to
the citie of <HI>Alexandria</HI> vpwards by the riuer <HI>Nilus</HI> vnto a city
named <HI>Coptus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Coptus. Myos-Hormos now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on the Red sea.</NOTE> and from thence to be conueyed by land to a
hauen standing vpon the <HI>Red sea</HI> called <HI>Myos-Hormos;</HI>
which way was trauailed in the night, the pilots directing
themselues by the stars, which were expert in that practise.
And because water was scant that way, they vsed to carrie it
with them for all the companie, till at the last to auoide that
trouble they digged very déepe wels, and made large cisterns
for the receipt of raine water, by which the way furnished
with that commoditie, which at the first it wanted grewe in
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>
continuance of time to be the more frequented.</P>
<P>But whereas the straight way was dangerons by reason
of flats and islands, the aforesaid king <HI>Philadelphus</HI> with his
armies went on the side of <HI>Troglodytica,</HI> and in an hauen
called <HI>Berenice</HI> caused the ships to arriue which came out of
<HI>India,</HI> being a place of more suretie and lesse perill; from
whence they might easily carrie the wares to the citie of
<HI>Coptus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The cause of the greatnes of Alexandria.</NOTE> and so to <HI>Alexandria.</HI> And by this meane <HI>Alexandria</HI>
grew so famous and rich, that in those daies there was no
citie of the world comparable to it. And to speake briefly and
particularly of the abundance of trafficke there vsed, it is left
written for an assured truth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strabo lib. 17. pag. 549.</NOTE> that in the time of king <HI>Ptole∣mey
Auletes</HI> father vnto <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> it yéelded in customes
vnto him yéerly seuen millions and an halfe of gold, although
the trafficke was not then scant twenty yéeres old, by way of
that citie.</P>
<P>But after that this prouince and countrey became subiect
to the Emperours of <HI>Rome,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Strabo lib. 17. pag. 549.</NOTE> as they were greater in power,
and néerer in couetousnes, so they enhansed the customes: so
that within a little time the citie yéelded double the foresaide
summe. For the traffike grew so excéeding great, that they
sent euery yéere into <HI>India</HI> 120. ships laden with wares,
which began to set saile from <HI>Myos-Hormos</HI> about the mid∣dle
of Iuly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plinius lib 6. cap. 23.</NOTE> and returned backe againe within one yéere.</P>
<P>The marchandise which they did carrie amounted vnto
one million two hundred thousand crownes, and there was
made in returne of euery crowne an hundred. In so much
that by reason of this increase of wealth the matrones or no∣ble
women of that time and place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plinius lib. 12. cap. 18.</NOTE> spent infinitely in decking
themselues with precious stones, purple, pearles muske, am∣ber,
and the like: whereof the writers and historians of that
age speake very greatly.</P>
<P><HI>Cornelius Nepos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plinius lib. 2. cap. 67.</NOTE> alleaged by <HI>Plinie,</HI> maketh report of a
king of <HI>Egypt,</HI> that raigned in his time called <HI>Ptolemaeus La∣thyrus,</HI>
from whom one <HI>Eudoxus</HI> fled vpon occasion, and the
better to auoid and escape his hands he passed through the
<HI>Arabicke</HI> gulfe, and the sea, all along the coast of <HI>Africa</HI> and
the Cape of <HI>Bona Sperança</HI> till he came vnto the Island of
<HI>Cadiz:</HI> and this nauigation by that course was in those daies
as often vsed as now it is, if we may giue credit to the histo∣ries.
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
Which appiereth the more manifest by this, that <HI>Caius
Caesar</HI> the sonne of <HI>Augustus</HI> going into <HI>Arabia</HI> did finde in
the <HI>Red sea</HI> certaine péeces of those ships, which came thi∣ther
out of <HI>Spaine.</HI> It was a vse also long after those daies to
passe to <HI>India</HI> by land. For so did the kings of the <HI>Soldans,</HI>
and the princes of <HI>Bactria,</HI> and other famous captaines, who
trauailing thither and into <HI>Scythia</HI> by land, had the view of
those prouinces and countreyes, so farre till they came that
way vnto the * West, and to the seas thereof on the north
part, whereunto many marchants then did trauaile. <HI>Marcus
Paulus Venetus</HI> writeth much hereof.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Paulus Venetus commended.</NOTE> And although at the
first his booke was taken for a fabulous thing, yet now there
is better credit giuen vnto it, for that by the late experiences
of the trauailers and marchants of these daies into those
parts, the names of the countreyes, cities and townes, with
their situations, latitudes and commodities are now found
true, as he and other historiographers of that time haue re∣ported.</P>
<P>In the 200. yéere before the incarnation it is written, that
the <HI>Romanes</HI> sent an armie by sea into <HI>India</HI> against the great
<HI>Can</HI> of <HI>Cathaia,</HI> which passing through the straight of <HI>Gibral∣tar,</HI>
and running to the northwest, found right ouer against
the Cape <HI>Finisterre</HI> ten Islands, wherein was much tinne:
And they may be those which were called the <HI>Cassiterides,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cassiterides.</NOTE> &amp;
being come to 50. degrées of latitude they found a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The northwest passage, though the latitude be somewhat mis∣taken.</NOTE> Straight;
and passing through it towards the west, they arriued in the
Empire of <HI>India,</HI> and fought with the king of <HI>Cathay,</HI> and so
came backe againe vnto the citie of <HI>Rome.</HI> Which thing how∣soeuer
it may séeme either possible or not possible, true or not
true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What histories may these be?</NOTE> yet so I finde it left to vs recorded in the * histories of
that time.</P>
<P>In the 100. yéere after the incarnation of Christ the Em∣perour
<HI>Traiane</HI> prepared an armie by sea vpon the riuers
<HI>Euphrates</HI> and <HI>Tigris,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Xiphil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nus in vita Traiani.</NOTE> and departed from them, and sailed to
the Islands of <HI>Zyzara,</HI> and passing the straight of <HI>Persia</HI> en∣tred
into the <HI>Ocean</HI> sea and sailed towards <HI>India</HI> all along
the coast till he came to that place where <HI>Alexander</HI> had béen,
and there he tooke certaine ships which came from <HI>Bengala,</HI>
of whom he learned the state of that countrey. But because he
was then in yéeres and wearie with his trauaile, but especi∣ally
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
because he found there small reliefe for his armie, he re∣turned
backe.</P>
<P>After that the <HI>Romanes</HI> had gotten the most part of the
world, there were in that age made many, and notable disco∣ueries.
But then came the <HI>Gothes, Moores,</HI> and other barba∣rous
nations, and destroied all. For in the yéere 412. after
the incarnation of Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rome taken by the Gothes 412.</NOTE> they tooke the citie of <HI>Rome:</HI> And
the <HI>Vandales</HI> came out of <HI>Spaine</HI> and conquered <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>And in the yeere 450. the king called <HI>Atila</HI> destroied many
cities in <HI>Italie:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The originall of Venice 450.</NOTE> at which time the citie of <HI>Venice</HI> began. And
in this age the <HI>Frankes</HI> and <HI>Vandals</HI> entred into <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>In the yéere 474. the Empire of <HI>Rome</HI> was lost, and fell
from the <HI>Romanes</HI> to the <HI>Gothes.</HI></P>
<P>And after this came the <HI>Lombards</HI> into <HI>Italie,</HI> namely in
the yéere 560.</P>
<P>Also about this time the sect of the <HI>Arrians</HI> preuailed great∣ly:
and at this time one <HI>Merline</HI> of <HI>England</HI> was famous
for his prophecies.</P>
<P>To be short,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sect of Ma∣humet began anno 611.</NOTE> in the yéere 611. sproong vp the <HI>Mahumetane</HI>
sect and <HI>Morisco</HI> regiment, which by force inuaded both
<HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Spaine.</HI></P>
<P>By all this it may appéere, that in that age all the world
was in an hurly burly, and all places very tumultuous. In so
much that trafficke and marchandise ceased:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trafficke and nauigation cease.</NOTE> for no nation
durst trade one with another neither by sea nor land: nothing
as then remained stedfast neither in monarchies nor king∣domes,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ramusius 1. vol. fol 372. pag. 2.</NOTE> signiories, religions, lawes, artes, sciences, nor naui∣gations.
Nor so much as the records and writings of such
things did remaine, but were all burnt and consumed by the
barbarous crueltie and vnbrideled power of the <HI>Gothes:</HI>
who became so couetous and ambitious, that they purposed
of themselues to begin a new world, and to roote out the me∣morie,
and blot out the knowledge of all other nations be∣sides.</P>
<P>But they that succéeded after these times in the gouern∣ment
of things, perceiuing the great and huge losse, that the
Christian world had by the want of trafficke and ceasing of
nauigation, whereby those commodities and marchandises
could not be spent, which before went ordinarily from one
nation to another by the vse of trade: to the end that this
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>
decay and losse might be repaired, and the treasures of the
East might be imparted with the West, as it was woont in
the times of quietnes and peaceable liuing, they began to
deuise a way to passe to <HI>India,</HI> which was not as the former
way was by the <HI>Red sea</HI> and the riuer <HI>Nilus,</HI> but a way of far∣ther
sailing &amp; farther length and cost also. For they brought
their ware vp the riuer <HI>Indus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ramusius 1. vol. fol. 373.</NOTE> and there vnladed it, carrying
it by land through the countrey of <HI>Paropanisus</HI> by Carauans
vnto the prouince of <HI>Bactria,</HI> and then shipped it in barks on
the riuer <HI>Oxus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A way by the ri∣uer Oxus, the Caspian sea, Vol∣ga, and ouer land to Caffa.</NOTE> which falleth into the <HI>Caspian</HI> sea, and so sai∣led
ouer that sea vnto an hauen of the riuer <HI>Rha</HI> named <HI>Citra∣can</HI>
or <HI>Astracan,</HI> and so vpwards in the said riuer which now
is called <HI>Volga;</HI> and as it appéereth they carried it to the citie
of <HI>Nouogrode</HI> in the prouince of <HI>Resan,</HI> which now belongeth
to the great Duke of <HI>Moscouia,</HI> standing toward the north in
54. degrées of latitude: &amp; therehence they trauailed ouer land
vnto the prouince of <HI>Sarmatia</HI> vnto the riuer <HI>Tanais,</HI> which is
the diuision of <HI>Europe</HI> from <HI>Asia;</HI> where they againe laded it
in barks, and caried it downe the riuer, into the lake <HI>Maeotis,</HI>
and to the citie of <HI>Caffa,</HI> which in ancient time was called
<HI>Theodosia,</HI> which then belonged to the <HI>Genowais,</HI> who came
thither for those wares in their galliasses or great ships.</P>
<P>It is also left written, that the trade this way endured
vntill the raigne of <HI>Commodita</HI> Emperour of <HI>Armenia,</HI> who
prouided for a better course, and commanded this trafficke
of the spices to be conueied by the <HI>Caspian</HI> sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strabo lib. 11.</NOTE> and so through
the kingdome of <HI>Hiberia,</HI> which now is called <HI>Georgiana,</HI> and
from thence they entred by the riuer <HI>Phasis,</HI> now <HI>Phasso,</HI> into
<HI>Pontus Euxinus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The marte of spices at Trape∣zunda. Ramusius ibidem.</NOTE> and so vnto the city of <HI>Trapezunda</HI> standing
in 40. and odde degrées of northerly latitude. And to that
place came shipping for the marchandises out of <HI>Europe</HI> and
<HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>It is further left recorded concerning this way of traf∣ficke,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strabo lib. 11. Plinius lib. 6. cap. 11.</NOTE> that <HI>Nicanor</HI> determined or had already begun to open
aboue 120. miles of land, which lieth betwéene the <HI>Caspian</HI>
sea and <HI>Pontus Euxinus,</HI> that they might come and goe by
water with their spices, drugs, and other commodities, there
vsed. But in the meane time this mischiefe happened, that
<HI>Ptolemey Ceraunos</HI> killed him, and by his death this woor∣thy
and famous enterprise ceased without effect.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="16"/>
But the other way being also at last lost by reason of the
wars of the <HI>Turks,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another way to Boghar, and so by carauans into Persia by the riuer Ganges.</NOTE> it pleased God to open another way to

of great value, and much rubarbe. After this these marchan∣dise,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The way by Or∣mus and Balsara and so to Aleppo and Barutti.</NOTE> drugs, and spiceries were carried in ships vpon the <HI>In∣dian</HI>

they were caried ouer land vnto the cities of <HI>Aleppo, Damas∣cus,</HI>

there the <HI>Venetian</HI> gallies or galliasses, which transported

seemed to haue come from the coast of <HI>Baccalaos,</HI> which stan∣deth

greatly woondered to sée such a barge, and such people,
not knowing from whence they came, nor vnderstanding
their spéech, especially because there was then no knowledge
of that countrey, as now there is: it may be credible that
though the boate was small in respect of those huge seas, yet
the winde and water might bring them thither: as we sée in
these our daies, that the Almadie which is but a small boate
commeth notwithstanding from <HI>Quiloa, Mosambique,</HI> and

<P>In the yéere 1300. after the comming of Christ the great

So that each Prince vsed a custome to augment the

the <HI>Canaries,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Canarie Islands.</NOTE> standing in 28. degrées of latitude to the north,
because they were giuen vnto him by Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the sixt,

grew a knowledge of those Islands in all <HI>Europe,</HI> and speci∣ally
in <HI>Spaine:</HI> for such great Princes would not begin nor

<P>About this time also the Island of <HI>Madera</HI> was discouered
by an <HI>English</HI> man called <HI>Macham:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Island of Madera disco∣uered by Ma∣cham an Eng∣lish man.</NOTE> who sailing out of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
into <HI>Spaine,</HI> with a woman of his, was driuen out of his

his anker in that hauen, which now is called <HI>Machico</HI> after
the name of <HI>Macham.</HI> And bicause his louer was then sea-sicke,
he there went on land with some of his companie, and
in the meane time his ship weyed and put to sea, leauing him
there: whereupon his louer for thought died. <HI>Macham,</HI> which
greatly loued her, built in the Island a chappell or hermitage
to burie her in, calling it by the name of <HI>Iesus Chappell:</HI> and
wrote or graued vpon the stone of her tombe his name and
hers, and the occasion whereupon they arriued there. After
<PB N="20" REF="17"/>
this he made himselfe a boate all of a trée, the trées being there
of a great compasse about, and went to sea in it with those
men of his companie that were left with him, and fell with
the coast of <HI>Africke</HI> without saile or oare, and the <HI>Moores</HI>
among whom he came tooke it for a miracle, and presented
him vnto the king of that countrey: and that king also admi∣ring
the accident, sent him and his companie vnto the king
of <HI>Castile.</HI></P>
<P>In the yéere 1395. king <HI>Henrie</HI> the third of that name reig∣ning
in <HI>Castile,</HI> the information which <HI>Macham</HI> gaue of this
Island, and also the ship wherein he went thither, mooued

is forbidden to the king and the religious people. It is said
that of all other people of those parts they be most vertuous

their houses. This kingdome hath in length 250. leagues,
and in bredth 80. Of this only kingdome the king may bring
foorth into the field thirtie thousand elephants, when he go∣eth

<P>There is in this countrey a certaine small vermine, which
vseth to cleaue fast to the trunke of the elephant, and draweth
the blood of the elephant, and so he dieth thereof. The skull of
this vermine is so hard, that the shot of an handgun cannot

that they séeme at the first to be one entire and maine land.
The course by these Islands is aboue fiue hundred leagues.
The ancient Cosmographers call all these Islands by the

found dead men hanging in the houses; for the people there
are eaters of mans flesh. Here the <HI>Portugals</HI> burnt the ship
wherein <HI>Francis Serrano</HI> was, for she was old and rotten.
They went to a place on the other side standing in 8. degrées

<P>They say that not farre from the Islands of <HI>Banda</HI> there is
an Island, where there bréedeth nothing else but snakes, and
the most are in one caue in the middest of the land. This is a
thing not much to be woondred at; for as much as in the Le∣uant
sea hard by the Isles of <HI>Maiorca</HI> and <HI>Minorca</HI> there is
another Island of old named <HI>Ophi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sa,</HI> and now <HI>Formentera,</HI>

<P>In the yéere 1512. they departed from <HI>Banda</HI> toward <HI>Ma∣lacea,</HI>
and on the baxos or flats of <HI>Luçapinho Francis Ser∣rano</HI>

degrée, where they liued seuen or eight yeeres.</P>
<P>The Island of <HI>Gumnape</HI> now called <HI>Ternate</HI> is much to
be admired, for that it casteth out fire. There were some

princes of the <HI>Moores</HI> and couragious <HI>Portugals</HI> which de∣termined
to goe néere to the firie place to sée what it was; but

so extreme cold, that he could not suffer his hand in it, nor
yet put any of the water in his mouth: And yet this place
standeth vnder the line, where the sunne continually burneth.
In these Islands of <HI>Maluco</HI> there is a kinde of men that haue
spurres on their ankles like vnto cocks.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monstrous men.</NOTE> And it was told me
by the king of <HI>Tydore,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Batochina.</NOTE> that in the Islands of <HI>Batochina</HI> there
were people that had tailes, and had a thing like vnto a dug

are smal hennes also which lay their egges vnder the ground
aboue a fathome and an halfe, and the egges are bigger then
ducks egges, and many of these hennes are blacke in their
flesh. There are hogs also with hornes, and parats which
prattle much, which they call <HI>Noris.</HI> There is also a riuer of
water so hot, that whatsoeuer liuing creature cōmeth into it,
their skins will come off, and yet fish bréede in it. There are
crabs which be very swéete, and so strong in their clawes,
that they will breake the iron of a pik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>axe. There be others
also in the sea little and hairie, but whosoeuer eateth of them
dieth immediately. There be likewise certaine oisters, which
they doe call <HI>Bras,</HI> the shels whereof haue so large a compasse,
that they doe Christen in them. In the sea also there are liuely
stones, which doe grow and increase like vnto fish, whereof
very good lime is made: and if they let it lie when it is taken
out of the water, it looseth the strength, and it neuer burneth
after.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The flowers of Xistus and Arbor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are such.</NOTE> There is also a certaine trée, which beareth flowers at

There is a fruit also, as they say, whereof if a woman that is

is further a kinde of herbe there growing, which followeth

arriued in his countrey: for so they called the <HI>Castillians.</HI> But
he was troubled vpon that newes: for his Gods, (which are
to be thought to be diuels) had told him, that such people as
the <HI>Spanyards</HI> were should destroy his law and countrey, and
be Lords thereof. And therefore he sent gifts vnto <HI>Cortes,</HI> in

reported that he came to Cape <HI>Razo</HI> in 46. degrées to the
north: from whence he came backe againe to the <HI>Groine</HI> la∣den
with slaues. The newes hereof ran by and by through
<HI>Spaine,</HI> that he was come home laden with cloues as mista∣king
the word: and it was carried to the Court of <HI>Spaine:</HI>
but when the truth was knowne it turned to a pleasant iest.
In this voiage <HI>Gomes</HI> was ten monethes.</P>
<P>In this yéere 1525. Don <HI>George de Meneses</HI> captaine of
<HI>Maluco,</HI> and with him Don <HI>Garcia Henriques</HI> sent a foyst to
discouer land towards the north, wherein went as captaine
one <HI>Diego de Rocha,</HI> and <HI>Gomes de Sequeira</HI> for pilot. In 9.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Isle of Ba∣tochina by Gi∣lolo.</NOTE> and they called them the Islands of <HI>Gomes de Se∣queira,</HI>
he being the first pilot that discouered them. And they

<P>In the yéere 1526. there went out of <HI>Siuill</HI> one <HI>Sebastian

thrée monethes for a winde to double the Cape of <HI>Saint Au∣gustine.</HI>
In the Bay of <HI>Patos</HI> or of ducks the Admirall ship
perished; and being without hope to get to the Isles of <HI>Ma∣luco</HI>
they there made a pinnesse to enter vp the riuer of <HI>Plate,</HI>
and to search it. They ran 60. leagues vp before they came to
the barre: where they left their great ships, and with their
small pinnesses passed vp the riuer <HI>Parana,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Parana.</NOTE> which the inha∣bitants

120. leagues, they made a fortresse and staied there aboue a

another riuer called <HI>Paragioa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rio Paragioa.</NOTE> and perceiuing that the coun∣trey
yéelded gold and siluer they kept on their course, and sent
a brigandine before; but those of the countrey tooke it: and
<HI>Cabote</HI> vnderstanding of it thought it best to turne backe vn∣to
their forte, and there tooke in his men which he had left
there, and so went downe the riuer where his ships did ride,
and from thence he sailed home to <HI>Siuill</HI> in the yéere 1530.
leauing discouered about two hundred leagues within this
riuer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fountaine of the Riuer of Plata.</NOTE> reporting it to be very nauigable, and that it springeth

<P>In the yéere 1517. one <HI>Pamphilus de Naruaez</HI> went out

<HI>Florida</HI> as farre as <HI>Rio de las Palmas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ramusius 3. vol. fol. 310.</NOTE> and had with him fiue

He could not goe on land where his desire was, but went on
land somewhat néere to <HI>Florida</HI> with thrée hundred of his
companie, some horses, and some victuailes, commanding the
ships to goe to <HI>Rio de las Palmas;</HI> in which voiage they were
almost all lost:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Isle of Xamo or Malhada.</NOTE> and those which escaped passed great dangers,
hunger and thirst in an Island called <HI>Xamo</HI> and by the <HI>Spani∣ards
Malhada</HI> being very drie and barren, where the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI>
killed one another, and the people also of the countrey
did the like. <HI>Naruaez</HI> and those which went with him sawe
some golde with certaine <HI>Indians,</HI> and he demanded of them
where they gathered it: and they answered that they had it
at <HI>Apalachen.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Apalachen.</NOTE> They therefore searched this gold, and in sear∣ching
came to the said towne, where they found no gold nor

they went to a towne called <HI>Aute;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aute.</NOTE> and from thence to
<HI>Xamo</HI> a poore countrey with small sustinance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Xamo.</NOTE> These people
bring vp their children very tenderly, and make great lamen∣tation
when any of them dieth; they neither wéepe nor la∣ment
at the death of any olde bodie. Here the people desired
the <HI>Spanyards</HI> to cure their sicke folks, for they had many dis∣eased:
and certaine of the <HI>Spanyards</HI> being in extreme pouer∣tie
assaied it, and vsed praier, and it pleased God that they did
indéede recouer as well those that were hurt, as those which
were otherwise diseased; in so much, that one which was
thought verily to be dead, was by them restored to life, as
they themselues reporte. They affirme that they passed
through many countreies and many strange people differing
in language, apparell, and customes. And because they plaied
the physitions, they were as they passed greatly estéemed and
held for Gods, and the people did no hurt vnto them, but
would giue them part of such things as they had. Therefore
they passed quietly, and trauailed so farre till they came to a
people, that vse continually to liue in heards with their cattel
as the <HI>Arabians</HI> doe. They be poore, and eate snakes, lisards,
spiders, ants, and al kinde of vermine, and herewith they liue
so well contented that commonly they sing and dance. They
buie the women of their enimies, and kill their daughters,
because they would not haue them marrie with them, where∣by
they might increase. They trauailed through certaine pla∣ces,
where the women gaue sucke vnto their children til they
were ten or twelue yéeres of age; and where certaine men
being <HI>Hermaphrodites</HI> doe marrie one another. These <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
trauailed aboue 800. leagues; and there escaped aliue
in this iourney not aboue seuen or eight of them. They came
vpon the coast of the South sea vnto a citie called <HI>Saint Mi∣chael</HI>
of <HI>Culuacan</HI> standing in 23. degrées and vpward to∣ward

<P>This yéere 1527. when <HI>Cortes</HI> vnderstood by the pinnesse

as gouernour in those ships one <HI>Aluaro de Saavedra Ceron,</HI>
cosen vnto <HI>Cortes,</HI> a man fit for that purpose. He made saile
from <HI>Ciuatlanejo,</HI> now named <HI>S. Christopher</HI> standing in 20.
degrées toward the north on <HI>All Saints</HI> day. They arriued at
the Islands which <HI>Magelan</HI> named <HI>The Pleasures;</HI> and from

discouered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Islas de los Reyes.</NOTE> &amp; not knowing thereof, they named thē <HI>Islas de los
Reyes,</HI> that is to say, <HI>The Isles of the kings,</HI> because they came
vnto them on <HI>Twelfe</HI> day. In the way <HI>Saavedra</HI> lost two
ships of his company, of which they neuer after heard newes.
But from Island to Island he still sailed and came to the
Island of <HI>Candiga,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Candiga.</NOTE> where he bought two <HI>Spanyards</HI> for 70.
ducats, which had béene of the companie of Frier <HI>Loaisa,</HI> who
was lost thereabout.</P>
<P>In the yéere 1528. in March <HI>Saavedra</HI> arriued at the I∣slands
of <HI>Maluco,</HI> and came to an anker before the Isle of
<HI>Gilolo:</HI> he found the sea calme and winde at will, without
any tempests: and he tooke the distance from thence to <HI>Noua
Spagna</HI> to be 2050. leagues. At this time <HI>Martin Yn̄iguez de
Carquiçano</HI> died, and <HI>Fernando de la Torre</HI> was chosen their
Generall, who then was in the citie of <HI>Tidore,</HI> who had there
erected a gallows and had fierce warre with Don <HI>George de

had the fourth day of May <HI>Saavedra</HI> tooke from him a gali∣otte
and slew the captaine thereof called <HI>Fernando de Bal∣daya,</HI>
and in Iune he returned towards <HI>New Spaine,</HI> hauing

and hauing béene certaine monethes at sea, he was forced
backe vnto <HI>Tidore,</HI> where <HI>Patalin</HI> was beheaded and quar∣tered,

<P>In this yéere 1528. <HI>Cortes</HI> sent two hundred footemen and

rich of gold. This being done he shipped himselfe, and came
into <HI>Castile</HI> with great pompe, &amp; brought with him 250000.
marks of gold and siluer: and being come to <HI>Toledo</HI> where
the Emperour then lay, he was entertained according to his
deserts, and the Emperour made him Marques <HI>Del Valle,</HI>
and married him to the Lady <HI>Iane de Zuniga</HI> daughter vnto
the Earle <HI>de Aguilar,</HI> and then the Emperour sent him backe
<PB N="70" REF="42"/>
againe to be Generall of <HI>New Spaine.</HI></P>
<P>In the yéere 1529. in May <HI>Saavedra</HI> returned back againe
towards <HI>New Spaine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gomara hist. gen. lib. 2. cap. 72.</NOTE> and he had sight of a land toward the
South in two degrées, and he ran East along by it aboue fiue
hundred leagues till the end of August. The coast was cleane
and of good ankerage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Noua Guinea.</NOTE> but the people blacke and of curled
haire; from the girdle downward they did weare a certaine
thing plaited to couer their lower parts. The people of <HI>Ma∣luco</HI>
call them <HI>Papuas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Os Papuas are blacke people with frisled haire.</NOTE> because they be blacke and friseled in
their haire: and so also doe the <HI>Portugals</HI> call them.</P>
<P><HI>Saavedra</HI> hauing sailed 4. or 5. degrées to the South of the
line, returned vnto it, and passed the Equinoctiall towards
the north, and discouered an Island which he called <HI>Isla de los
Pintados,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isla de los Pin∣tados.</NOTE> that is to say, The Isle of painted people: for the
people thereof be white, and all of them marked with an iron:
and by the signes which they gaue he conceaued that they
were of <HI>China.</HI> There came vnto them from the shore a kinde
of boate full of these men, making tokens of threatnings to
the <HI>Spanyards;</HI> who séeing that the <HI>Spanyards</HI> would not
obey them, they began to skirmish with slinging of stones,
but <HI>Saavedra</HI> would suffer no shot to be shot at them, because
their stones were of no strength, and did no harme.</P>
<P>A little beyond this Island in 10. or 12. degrées they found
many small low Islands full of palme trées and grasse, which
they called <HI>Los Iardines,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Los Iardines.</NOTE> and they came to an anker in the
middest of them, where they taried certaine daies. The peo∣ple
séemed to descend from them of <HI>China,</HI> but by reason of
their long continuance there they are become so brutish, that
they haue neither law, nor yet giue themselues to any honest
labour. They were white clothing which they make of
grasse. They stand in maruailous feare of fire, because they
neuer saw any. They eate <HI>Cocos</HI> in stéede of bread, breaking
them before they be ripe, and putting them vnder the sand,
and then after certaine daies they take them out and lay them
in the sunne, and then they will open. They eate fish which
they take in a kinde of boate called a <HI>Parao,</HI> which they make
of pine wood,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wood.</NOTE> which is driuen thither at certaine times of the
yéere, they know not how, nor from whence, and the tooles
wherewith they make their boates are of shels.</P>
<P><HI>Saavedra</HI> perceiuing that the time and weather was then
<PB N="71" REF="42"/>
somewhat better for his purpose, made saile towards the
firme land and citie of <HI>Panama,</HI> where he might vnlade the
cloues and marchandise which he had, that so in cartes it
might be carried fower leagues to the riuer of <HI>Chagre,</HI> which
they say is nauigable running out into the North sea not far
from <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> where the ships ride, which come out
of <HI>Spaine:</HI> by which way all kinde of goods might be brought
vnto them in shorter time, and with lesse danger, then to saile
about the Cape of <HI>Bona Sperança.</HI> For from <HI>Maluco</HI> vnto
<HI>Panama</HI> they saile continually betwéene the <HI>Tropickes</HI> and
the line: but they neuer found winde to serue that course, and
therefore they came backe againe to <HI>Maluco</HI> very sad, be∣cause
<HI>Saavedra</HI> died by the way: who if he had liued meant
to haue opened the land of <HI>Gastillia del Oro</HI> and <HI>New Spaine</HI>
from sea to sea.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fower narrow passages from sea to sea in the West Indies.</NOTE> Which might haue béene done in fower pla∣ces:

which springeth out of a lake thrée or fower leagues from the
South sea, and falleth into the North sea; whereupon doe
saile great barks and crayers. The other place is from <HI>Teco∣antepee</HI>
through a riuer to <HI>Verdadera Cruz</HI> in the Bay of the
<HI>Honduras,</HI> which also might be opened in a streight. Which if
it were done, then they might saile from the <HI>Canaries</HI> vnto
the <HI>Malucos</HI> vnder the climate of the <HI>Zodiake</HI> in lesse time
and with much lesse danger, then to saile about the Cape <HI>de

Northwest.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The northwest passage very beneficiall.</NOTE> And yet if there might be found a streight there

doe much good.</P>
<P>In this yéere 1529, one <HI>Damian de Goes</HI> a <HI>Portugal</HI> being
in <HI>Flanders,</HI> after that he had trauailed ouer all <HI>Spaine,</HI> was
yet desirous to sée more countreyes, and fashions, and diuer∣sities

<HI>Scotland,</HI> and was in the courts of the kings of those parts:

and so through the cities of <HI>Colen, Spyres, Argentine,

trauailing so farre, that he found himselfe in 70. degrées of

with all the kings, princes, nobles and chiefe cities of
all Christendome in the space of 22. yéeres: So that by reason
of the greatnes of his trauell, I thought him a man woorthie
to be here remembred.</P>
<P>In the yéere 1529. or 1530. one <HI>Melchior de Sofa Tauarez</HI>
went from the citie of <HI>Ormuz</HI> vnto <HI>Balfera</HI> and the Islands
of <HI>Gissara</HI> with certaine ships of warre, and passed vp as farre
as the place, where the riuers <HI>Tygris</HI> and <HI>Euphrates</HI> méete
one with the other. And although other <HI>Portugals</HI> had disco∣uered

sailed so farre vpon the fresh water till that time, when he dis∣couered

<HI>Ferdinand, Iohn, Gonzaluo,</HI> and <HI>Francis Martines de Alcan∣tara:</HI>
They were not well receiued by <HI>Diego de Almagro,</HI>
and his friends; for that <HI>Pisarro</HI> had not so much commended
him to the Emperour as he looked for, but omitted the disco∣uerie,
wherein he had lost one of his eies, and spent much:
yet in the end they agreed, and <HI>Diegro de Almagro</HI> gaue vnto
<HI>Pisarro</HI> 700. pezoes of golde, victuailes and munition, where∣with
he prepared himselfe the better for his iourney.</P>
<P>Not long after this agréement <HI>Francis Pisarro</HI> and his bre∣thren
went in two ships with the most of their soldiers and
horses; but he could not arriue at <HI>Tumbez</HI> as he was min∣ded,
and so they went on land in the riuer of <HI>Peru;</HI> and went
along the coast with great paines, because there were many

so he went on his iourney to the hauen named <HI>Porto Viejo:</HI>
and thither came vnto him one <HI>Sebastian de Benalcazar,</HI> with
all such things as had sent for, which pleased and pleasured
him very much.</P>
<P>In the yéere 1531. he hauing this aide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gomara hist. gen. lib. 5. cap. 4.</NOTE> passed ouer into a

bound them with chaines of gold and siluer. The gouernour
<PB N="74" REF="44"/>
caused those that kept his wines to haue their noses, armes,
and priuie members to be cut off, so iealous was he. Here <HI>Pi∣sarro</HI>
found aboue sixe hundred men prisoners belonging to
the king <HI>Attabalipa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gomara hist. gen. lib. 5. cap. 5.</NOTE> who waged warre against his eldest
brother <HI>Guascar</HI> to winne reputation. These he set at libertie
and sent them to the citie of <HI>Tombez,</HI> who promised to be a
meane that he should be well receiued in those partes. But
when they saw themselues out of bondage, they forgat their
promise, and incited the people against the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> Then
<HI>Pisarro</HI> sent thrée <HI>Spaniards</HI> to <HI>Tombez</HI> to treate for peace,
whome they tooke and slew and sacrificed, and their priestes
wept not for pitie but of custome. <HI>Pisarro</HI> hearing of this
cruell fact, passed ouer to the maine, and set vpon the citie one
night suddenly and killed many of them, so that they presen∣ted
him with gifts of gold and siluer and other riches, and so
became friends. This done, he builded a towne vpon the ri∣uer
of <HI>Cira,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Michael of Tangarara.</NOTE> and called it <HI>Saint Michael</HI> of <HI>Tangarara,</HI> which
was the first towne inhabited by Christians in those partes;

Then he searched out a good and sure hauen for his ships, and
found that of <HI>Payta</HI> to be an excellent harbour.</P>
<P>In this same yéere 1531. there went one <HI>Diego de Ordas</HI>

to the <HI>Indians</HI> the Catholicke faith.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ramusius 3. vol. fol. 356.</NOTE> He that went farthest

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sibola.</NOTE> and came to the prouince of <HI>Sibola,</HI> where he found seuen
cities: and the farther he went, the richer he found the coun∣trie
of gold, siluer, precious stones, and shéepe bearing very
fine wool. Vpon the fame of this welth the viceroy <HI>don Anto∣nio
de Mendoça,</HI> and <HI>Cortes,</HI> determined to send a power thi∣ther.
But when they could not agrée thereupon <HI>Cortes</HI> went
ouer into <HI>Spaine</HI> in the yéere 1540. where afterward he died.</P>
<P>In this yéere 1538. began the ciuil warre betweene <HI>Pisar∣ro</HI>
and <HI>Alonagro,</HI> wherein at the last <HI>Alinagro</HI> was taken and
beheaded.</P>
<P>In the same yéere 1538. <HI>Antonie Galuano</HI> being chiefe
captaine in the isles of <HI>Maluco</HI> sent a ship towards the north,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gomara hist. gen. lib. 5. cap. 34.</NOTE>

whereof one <HI>Francis de Castro</HI> was captaine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Antonie Galua∣no chiefe cap∣taine of Maluco author of this worke.</NOTE> hauing com∣mandement
to conuert as many as he could to the faith. He
himselfe christened many, as the lords of the <HI>Celebes, Maca∣sares,
Amboynos, Moros, Moratax,</HI> and diuers other places,
When <HI>Francis de Gastro</HI> arriued at the Island of <HI>Mindanao,</HI>
sixe kings receiued the water of Baptisme, with their wiues,
children and subiects: and the most of them <HI>Antonie Galuano</HI>
gaue commandement to be called by the name of <HI>Iohn,</HI> in re∣membrance
that king <HI>Iohn</HI> the third raigned then in <HI>Por∣tugall.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Portugals</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> which haue béene in these
Islands affirme, that there be certaine hogs in them, which
besides the téeth which they haue in their mouthes, haue
other two growing out of their snouts, and as many behinde
their eares of a large span and an halfe in length. Likewise
they say there is a tree, the one halfe whereof, which standeth
towards the east is a good medicine against all poyson, &amp; the
other side of the trée which standeth toward the west is very
poison; and the fruite on that side is like a bigge pease; and
there is made of it the strongest poyson that is in all the
world. Also they report that there is there another trée, the
fruite whereof whosoeuer doth eate, shall be twelue houres
besides himselfe, and when he commeth againe vnto himselfe
he shall not remember what he did in the time of his mad∣nes.
Moreouer there are certaine crabs of the land, whereof
whosoeuer doth eate shall be a certaine space out of his wits.
Likewise the countrey people declare that there is a stone in
these Islands whereon whosoeuer sitteth shall be broken in
his bodie. It is farther to be noted, that the people of these
Islands do gild their téeth.</P>
<P>In the yéere 1539. <HI>Cortes</HI> sent thrée ships with <HI>Francis
Vlloa</HI> to discouer the coast of <HI>Coludean</HI> northward.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gomara hist gen. lib. 2. cap. 74. &amp;. Ramusius 3. vol. fol. 339.</NOTE> They

farthest end of that gulfe, which place they named <HI>Ancon de
Sane Andres,</HI> because they came thither on that saints daie:
Then they came out a long the coast on the other side,<NOTE PLACE="marg">California dou∣bled.</NOTE> and
doubled the point of <HI>California</HI> and entred in betwéene cer∣taine
Islands and the point, and so sailed along by it, till they
<PB N="84" REF="49"/>
came to 32. degrées,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cabo del En∣ganno.</NOTE> from whence they returned to newe
Spaine, enforced thereunto by contrarie windes and want
of victuals; hauing béene out about a yéere. <HI>Cortes</HI> according
to his account, spent 200000. ducates in these discoueries.</P>
<P>From <HI>Cabo del Enganno</HI> to another cape called <HI>Cabo de
Liampo in China</HI> there are 1000. or 1200. leagues sayling.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The distance be∣tweene America and China in 32. degrees is 1000 leagues Gomar. hist. gen. lib. 6. cap. 17.</NOTE>
<HI>Cortes</HI> and his captaines discouered new <HI>Spaine,</HI> from 12.
degrées to 32. from south to the north, being 700. leagues,
finding it more warme then cold, although snow do lie vpon
certaine mountaines most part of the yéere. In new <HI>Spaine</HI>
there be many trées, flowers and fruits of diuers sorts and
profitable for many things. The principall trée is named
<HI>Metl.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Metl an excel∣lent tree.</NOTE> It groweth not very high nor thicke. They plant and
dresse it as we do our vines. They say it hath fortie kinde of
leaues like wouen clothes, which serue for many vses. When
they be tender they make conserues of them, paper, and a
thing like vnto flaxe: they make of it mantles, mats, shooes,
girdles, and cordage. These trées haue certaine prickles so
strong and sharpe, that they sewe with them. The roots make
fire and ashes, which ashes make excellent good lie. They
open the earth from the roote and scrape it, and the iuice
which commeth out is like a sirrupe. If you do féeth it, it will
become honie; if you purifie it it will be sugar. Also you may
make wine and vineger thereof. It beareth the <HI>Coco.</HI> The
rinde rosted and crushed vpon sores and hurts healeth and
cureth. The iuice of the tops and roots mingled with incense
are good against poyson, and the biting of a viper. For these
manifold benefits it is the most profitable trée knowne to
growe in those parts.</P>
<P>Also there be there certaine small birds named <HI>Vicmalim.</HI>
Their bill is small and long. They liue of the dewe, and the
iuice of flowers and roses. Their feathers be verie small and
of diuers colours. They be greatly estéemed to worke golde
with. They die or sléepe euerie yéere in the moneth of Octo∣ber
fitting vpon a little bough in a warme and close place:
they reuiue or wake againe in the moneth of Aprill after that
the flowers be sprung,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The reuiued birds.</NOTE> and therefore they call them the reui∣ued
birds.</P>
<P>Likewise there be snakes in these parts, which sound as
though they had bels when they créepe. There be other which
<PB N="85" REF="49"/>
engender at the mouth, euen as they report of the viper.
There be hogges which haue a nauell on the ridge of their
backs, which assoone as they be killed and cut out, will by
and by corrupt and stinke.</P>
<P>Besides these there be certaine fishes which make a noyse
like vnto hogs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Snorting fishes.</NOTE> and will snort, for which cause they be named
snorters.</P>
<P>In the yéere 1538. and 1539. after that <HI>Diego de Almagro</HI>
was beheaded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gomara hist. gen. lib. 5. cap. 35.</NOTE> the Marques <HI>Francis Pisarro</HI> was not idle.
For he sent straight one <HI>Peter de Baldiuia</HI> with a good com∣panie
of men to discouer and conquere the countrey of <HI>Chili.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chili.</NOTE>
He was wel receiued of those of the countrey, but afterwards
they rose against him and would haue killed him by treason.
Yet for all the warre that he had with them, he discouered
much land, and the coast of the sea toward the southeast, till
he came into 40. degrées and more in latitude. While he was
in these discoueries he heard newes of a king called <HI>Leucen∣golma,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">This might be the temple in the lake of Ti∣ticaca.</NOTE> which commonly brought to the field two hundred
thousand fighting men against another king his neighbour,
and that this <HI>Leucengolma</HI> had an Island, and a temple
therein with two thousand priestes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cieça cap. 103.</NOTE> and that beyond them
were the <HI>Amazones,</HI> whose Quéene was called <HI>Guanomilla,</HI>
that is to say, <HI>The goldeu heauen.</HI> But as yet there are none
of these things discouered. About this time <HI>Gomez de Alua∣rado</HI>
went to conquer the prouince of <HI>Guanuco:</HI> and <HI>Francis
de Chauez</HI> went to subdue the <HI>Conchincos,</HI> which troubled
the towne of <HI>Truxillo,</HI> and the countreyes adioyning. <HI>Peter
de Vergara</HI> went to the <HI>Bracamores,</HI> a people dwelling to∣ward
the north from <HI>Quito. Iohn Perez de Vergara</HI> went
against the <HI>Ciaciapoians: Alfonsus de Mercadiglio</HI> went vn∣to
<HI>Mulubamba. Ferdinando</HI> and <HI>Gonzaluo Pisarros</HI> went to
subdue <HI>Collao,</HI> a countrey very rich in gold. <HI>Peter de Candia</HI>
went to the lower part of <HI>Collao. Peranzures</HI> also went to
conquer the said countrey. And thus the <HI>Spanyards</HI> disper∣sed
themselues, and conquered aboue seuen hundred leagues
of countrey in a very short space, though not without great
trauailes and losse of men.</P>
<P>The countreyes of <HI>Brasill</HI> and <HI>Peru</HI> stand east and west
almost 800. leagues distant. The néerest is from the Cape of
<HI>Saint Augustine</HI> vnto the hauen of <HI>Truxillo:</HI> for they stand
<PB N="86" REF="50"/>
both almost in one parallele and latitude. And the farthest is
950. leagues, reckoning from the riuer of <HI>Peru</HI> to the streits
of <HI>Magellan,</HI> which places lie directly north &amp; south, through
which countrey passe certaine mountaines named the <HI>An∣des,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mountaines of Andes.</NOTE> which diuide <HI>Brasill</HI> from the empire of the <HI>Ingas.</HI> After
this maner the mountaines of <HI>Taurus</HI> and <HI>Imaus</HI> diuide <HI>Asia</HI>
into two parts: which mountaines begin in 36. and 37. de∣grées
of northerly latitude at the end of the <HI>Mediterran</HI> sea
ouer against the Isles of <HI>Rhodes</HI> and <HI>Cyprus,</HI> running still
towards the East vnto the sea of <HI>China.</HI> And so likewise the
mountaines of <HI>Atlas</HI> in <HI>Africa</HI> diuide the tawnie <HI>Moores</HI>
from the blacke <HI>Moores</HI> which haue frisled haire, beginning
at mount <HI>Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es</HI> about the desert of <HI>Barca,</HI> and running along
vnder the <HI>Tropicke</HI> of <HI>Cancer</HI> vnto the <HI>Atlanticke Ocean.</HI></P>
<P>The mountains of the <HI>Andes</HI> be high, ragged, and in some
places barren without trées or grasse, whereon it raineth and
snoweth most commonly. Vpon them are windes and sud∣den
blastes; there is likewise such scarcitie of wood, that they
make fire of turffes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Earth of diuers colours good to dy withall.</NOTE> as they do in Flanders. In some pla∣ces
of these mountaines and countries the earth is of diuers
colours, as blacke, white, red, gréene, blew, yellow, and vio∣let,
wherewith they die colours without any other mixture.
From the bottomes of these mountaines spring many small
and great riuers, principally from the east side, as appéereth
by the riuers of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> of <HI>S. Francis,</HI> of <HI>Plata,</HI> and ma∣ny
others which runne through the countrey of <HI>Brasil,</HI> being
larger then those of <HI>Peru,</HI> or those of <HI>Castilia del oro.</HI> There
grow on these mountaines many turneps, rapes, and other
such like rootes and herbes. One there is like vnto <HI>Aipo</HI> or
Rue which beareth a yellow flower, and healeth all kinde of
rotten sores, and if you apply it vnto whole and cleane flesh it
will eate it vnto the bone: so that it is good for the vnsound
and naught for the whole.</P>
<P>They say there be in these mountains tigers, lions, beares,
woolues, wilde cats, foxes, Dantes, Ounces, hogs and déere:
birdes as well rauenous as others, and the most part of them
are blacke, as vnder the North both beasts &amp; birdes be white.
Also there be great &amp; terrible snakes which destroied a whole
armie of the <HI>Ingas</HI> passing that way, yet they say that an olde
woman did inchant them in such sort that they became so
<PB N="87" REF="50"/>
gentle, that a man might sit vpon one of them. The countrey
of <HI>Peru</HI> adioining vnto the mountaines of <HI>Andes</HI> westward
toward the sea, and containing 15. or 20. leagues in bredth is
all of very hot sand, yet fresh, bringing foorth many good trées
and fruites because it is well watered: where there growe
abundance of flags, rushes, herbes, and trées so slender and
loose, that laying your hands vpon them the leaues will fall
off. And among these herbes and fresh flowers the men and
women liue and abide without any houses or bedding, euen
as the cattell doe in the fields: and some of them haue tailes.
They be grosse, and weare long haire. They haue no beards,
yet haue they diuers languages.</P>
<P>Those which liue on the tops of these mountains of <HI>Andes</HI>
betwéene the cold and the heate for the most part be blinde of
one eie, and some altogether blinde, and scarce you shall finde
two men of them together, but one of them is halfe blinde.
Also there groweth in these fields, notwithstanding the great
heate of the sand good Maiz, and Potatos, and an herbe which
they name <HI>Coca,</HI> which they carrie continually in their
mouthes (as in the <HI>East India</HI> they vse another herbe named
<HI>Betele)</HI> which also (they say) satisfieth both hunger and thirst.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An herbe named Coca which sa∣tisfieth hunger and thirst.</NOTE>
Also there are other kindes of graines and rootes whereon
they féede. Moreouer there is plentie of wheate, barly, millet,
vines, and fruitful trées, which are brought out of <HI>Spaine</HI> and
planted there. For all these things prooue well in this coun∣trey,
because it is so commodiously watered.</P>
<P>Also they sow much cotton wooll, which of nature is white,
red, blacke, gréene, yellow, orange tawnie, and of diuers other
colours.</P>
<P>Likewise they affirme, that from <HI>Tumbez</HI> southward it
doth neither raine, thunder, nor lighten, for the space of fiue
hundred leagues of land: but at some times there falleth some
little shower. Also it is reported, that from <HI>Tumbez</HI> to <HI>Chili</HI>
there breede no peacocks, hennes, cocks, nor eagles, falcons,
haukes, kites, nor any other kinde of rauening fowles, and
yet there are of them in all other regions and countreies: but
there are many duckes; géese, herous, pigeons, partriges,
quailes, and many other kindes of birdes. There are also a
certaine kinde of fowle like vnto a ducke which hath no
wings to flie withall, but it hath fine thinne feathers which
<PB N="88" REF="51"/>
all the body. Likewise there are bitters that make war
with the seale or sea wolfe: for finding them out of the water
they will labour to picke out their eies, that they may not sée
to get to the water againe, and then they doe kill them. They
say it is a pleasant sight to behold the fight betwéene the said
bitters and seales. With the beards of these seales men make
cleane their téeth, because they be wholesome for the toothach.
There are certaine beastes which those of the countrey call
<HI>Xacos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Xacos a kinde of great sheepe that men ride vpon.</NOTE> and the <HI>Spanyards</HI> shéepe because they beare wooll like
vnto a shéepe, but are made much like vnto a déere, hauing a
a saddle backe like vnto a camell. They will carrie the bur∣teen
of 100. weight. The <HI>Spanyards</HI> ride vpon them, and
when they be wearie they will turne their heads backward,
and void out of their mouthes a woonderful stinking water.</P>
<P>From the riuer of <HI>Plata</HI> and <HI>Lima</HI> southward there bréede
no crocodiles nor lizards, no snakes, nor any kinde of vene
mous vermine, but great store of good fishes bréede in those
riuers. On the coast of <HI>Saint Michael</HI> in The South sea there
are many rocks of salt couered with egges. On the point of
<HI>Saint Helena</HI> are certaine Well springs which cast foorth a
liquor, that serueth in stead of pitch and tarre. They say that
in <HI>Chili</HI> there is a fountaine, the water whereof will conuert
wood into stone. In the hauen of <HI>Truxillo</HI> there is a lake of
fresh water, and the bottome thereof is of good hard salt. In
the <HI>Andes</HI> beyond <HI>Xauxa</HI> there is a riuer of fresh water, in the
bottome whereof there lieth white salt. Also they affirme by
the report of those of the countrey, that there haue dwelt gi∣ants
in <HI>Peru,</HI> of whose statures they found in <HI>Porto viejo,</HI> and
in the hauen of <HI>Truxillo,</HI> bones and iawes with téeth, which
were thrée and fower fingers long.</P>
<P>In the yeere 1540. the captaine <HI>Ferdinando Alorchon</HI>
went by the commandement of the Viceroy Don <HI>Antonio de
Mendoça</HI> with two ships to discouer the bottome of the gulfe
of <HI>California,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ramusius 3 vol. fol. 303.</NOTE> and diuers other countries.</P>
<P>In this yeere 1540. <HI>Gonsaluo Pisarro</HI> went out of the citie
of <HI>Quito</HI> to discouer the countrey of <HI>Canell</HI> or Cinamome, a
thing of great fame in that countrey. He had with him two
hundred <HI>Spanyards</HI> horsemen and footemen, and thrée hun∣dred
<HI>Indians</HI> to carrie burthens.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gomara hist. gen. lib. 5. cap. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> He went forward til he came
to <HI>Guixos,</HI> which is the farthest place gouerned by the <HI>Ingas:</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="51"/>
where there happened a great earthquake with raine and
lightning, which sunke 70. houses. They passed ouer cold and
snowie hils, where they found many <HI>Indians</HI> frozen to death,
maruelling much of the great snowe that they found vnder
the Equinoctiall line. From hence they went to a prouince
called <HI>Cumaco,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cumaco.</NOTE> where they tarried two monethes because it
rained continually. And beyond they sawe the Cinamome-trées,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cinamom trees</NOTE> which be very great, the leaues thereof resembling bay
leeues, both leaues, branches, rootes, and all tasting of Cina∣mome.

<P>From hence they went to the prouince and citie of <HI>Coca,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Coca.</NOTE>
where they rested fifty daies. From that place forwards they
trauailed along by a riuers side being 60. leagues long, with∣out
finding of any bridge, nor yet any foorde to passe ouer to
the other side. They found one place of this riuer, where it
had a fall of 200. fathoms déepe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">El pongo. a mighty fall of a riuer.</NOTE> where the water made
such a noise, that it would make a man almost deafe to stand
by it. And not far beneath this fall, they say they found a cha∣nell
of stone very smooth, of two hundred foote broad, and the
riuer runneth by: and there they made a bridge to passe ouer
on the other side,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guema.</NOTE> where they went to a countrey called <HI>Gue∣ma,</HI>
which was so poore, that they could get nothing to eate
but onely fruits and herbes. From that place forward they
found a people of some reason, wearing certaine clothing
made of cotton wooll, where they made a brigandine, &amp; there
they found also certaine Canoas, wherein they put their sicke
men, and their treasure and best apparell, giuing the charge
of them to one <HI>Francis de Orellana:</HI> and <HI>Gonsaluo Pizarro</HI>
went by land with the rest of the companie along by the ri∣uers
side, and at night went into the boates, and they trauai∣led
in this order two hundred leagues as it appeereth. When
<HI>Pizarro</HI> came to the place where he thought to finde the bri∣gandine
and Canoas, and could haue no sight of them nor yet
heare of them, he thought himselfe out of all hope, because he
was in a strange countrey without victuales, clothing, or any
thing else: wherefore they were faine to eate their horses,
<PB N="90" REF="52"/>
yea and dogs also, because the countrey was poore and bar∣ren,
and the iourney long, to goe to <HI>Quito.</HI> Yet notwithstan∣ding
taking a good hart to themselues they went on for∣wards
in their iourney, trauailing continually 18. monethes
and it is reported, that they went almost 5. hundred leagues,
wherein they did neither sée sunne nor any thing else where∣by
they might be comforted, wherefore of two hundred men
which went foorth at the first, there returned not backe past
ten vnto <HI>Quito,</HI> and these so weake, ragged, and disfigured
that they knew them not. <HI>Orellana</HI> went fiue hundred or sixe
hundred leagues downe the riuer, séeing diuers countreyes
and people on both sides thereof, among whom he affirmed
some to be <HI>Amazones.</HI> He came into <HI>Castile,</HI> excusing him∣selfe,
that the water and streames draue him downe perforce.
This riuer is named The riuer of <HI>Orellana,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rio de Orellana.</NOTE> &amp; other name it
the riuer of the <HI>Amazones,</HI> because there be women there
which liue like vnto them.</P>
<P>In the yéere 1540. <HI>Cortes</HI> went with his wife into <HI>Spaine</HI>

They required peace with the people and some victuals,

not to giue any thing to those that came vnto them in war∣like

of <HI>Acuco,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Acuco.</NOTE> where they had knowledge of <HI>Axa</HI> and <HI>Quiuira,</HI>
where there was a king very rich, that did worship a crosse
of golde, and the picture of the quéene of Heauen. They in∣dured
many extremities in this iourney, and the <HI>Indians</HI> fled
away from them, and in one morning they found thirtie of
their horses dead.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Circuie.</NOTE> From <HI>Cicuie</HI> they went to <HI>Quiuira,</HI> which
was two hundred leagues off,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quiuira.</NOTE> according to their account,
passing all through a plaine countrey, and making by the
way certaine hillocks of cowe dung, because thereby they
might not loose their way in their returne. They had there
haile-stones as bigge as Oranges. Now when they were
come to <HI>Quiuira,</HI> they found the king called <HI>Tatarrax,</HI> which
they sought for, with a iewell of copper hanging about his
necke, which was all his riches. They saw neither any crosse,
nor any image of the quéene of Heauen, nor any other token
of Christian religion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gomara hist. gen. lib. 6. cap. 18. &amp; 19.</NOTE> It is written of this countrey that it is

places, because the men and women goe in herds with their
cattell, whereof they haue great plentie, euen as the <HI>Arabians</HI>
do in <HI>Barbarie,</HI> and they remooue from place to place, euen as
the season serueth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sheepe as big as horses.</NOTE> and the pastures to féede their cattle. In
these parts are certaine beasts almost as bigge as horses,
they haue very great hornes, and they beare wooll like vnto
shéepe, and so the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call them. They haue abundance
of oxen verie monstrous, being camel-backed, and hauing
long beards, and on their necke long manes like vnto horses.
They liue with eating of these oxen and drinking of their
blood, and apparell themselues with the skins of the same.
The most part of the flesh that they do eate is rawe, or euill
rosted, for they lacke pots to séeth it in. They cut their meat
with certaine kniues made of flint stone. Their fruite are
damsons, hasel-nuts, walnuts, melons, grapes, pines, and
mulberies.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dogs carying 50. pound waight on their backs.</NOTE> There be dogges so bigge, that one of them alone
will hold a bull, though he be neuer so wilde. When they re∣mooue,
these dogs do carrie their children, wiues, and stuffe
vpon their backes, and they are able to carrie fiftie pound
waight. I passe ouer many things, because the order which
I follow will not permit me to be long.</P>
<P>In the yéere of our Lord 1542. one <HI>Diego de Freitas</HI> being
in the realme of <HI>Siam,</HI> and in citie of <HI>Dodra</HI> as captaine of a
ship, there fled from him thrée <HI>Portugals</HI> in a <HI>Iunco</HI> (which is
a kind of ship) towards <HI>China.</HI> Their names were <HI>Antony
de Mota, Francis Zeimoro,</HI> and <HI>Antony Pexoto,</HI> directing
their course to the citie of <HI>Liampo,</HI> standing in 30. and odde
degrées of latitude. There fell vpon their sterne such a storme,
that it set them off the land, and in fewe daies they sawe an
Island towards the east standing in 32. degrées, which they
do name <HI>Iapan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iapan discoue∣red by chance.</NOTE> which seemeth to be the Isle of <HI>Zipangri,</HI>
whereof <HI>Paulus Venetus</HI> maketh mention, and of the riches
thereof. And this Island of <HI>Iapan</HI> hath gold, siluer, and other
riches.</P>
<P>In this yéere 1542. <HI>Don Antonio de Mendoça</HI> Viceroy of
<HI>Nueua Spagna,</HI> sent his captaines and pilots to discouer the
coast of <HI>Cape del Enganno,</HI> where a fléete of <HI>Cortez</HI> had been
before. They sailed till they came to a place called <HI>Sierras Ne∣uadas,</HI>
or The snowie mountaines, standing in 40. degrées
toward the north, where they saw ships with merchandises,
<PB N="93" REF="53"/>
which carried on <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1+ words" DISP="〈◊…〉"/> the images of certaine birdes

thirtie daies sailing vnto their countrey.</P>
<P>In the same yéere 1542. <HI>Don Antony de Mendoça</HI> sent vn∣to
the Islands of <HI>Mindanao</HI> a fléete of sixe ships with fower
hundred soldiers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gomara hist. gen. lib. 4. cap. 13.</NOTE> and as many Indians of the countrey, the
generall whereof was one <HI>Rui Lopez de villa Lobos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ramusius 1. vol. fol. 375. pag. 1.</NOTE> being
his brother in law and a man in great estimation. They set
saile from the hauen of <HI>Natiuidad</HI> standing in 20. degrées to∣wards
the north, vpon <HI>All Saints</HI> éeue, and shaped their course
towards the west.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saint Thomas.</NOTE> They had sight of the Island of <HI>S. Thomas,</HI>
which <HI>Hernando de Grijalua</HI> had discouered, and beyond in
17. degrées they had sight of another Island which they na∣med
<HI>La Nublada,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">La Nublada.</NOTE> that is, The cloudie Island. From thence
they went to another Island named <HI>Roca partida,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Roca Partida.</NOTE> that is,
The clouen Rocke. The 3. of December they found certaine
<HI>Baxos</HI> or states of sixe or seuen fathoms déepe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baxo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> The 15. of the

discouered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Los Reyes.</NOTE> and named them <HI>Los Reyes,</HI> because they came
vnto them on <HI>Twelfe day.</HI> And beyond them they found other
Islands in 10. degrées all standing round, and in the midst
of them they came to an anker, where they tooke fresh water
and wood.</P>
<P>In the same yéere 1542. <HI>Don Diego de Almagro</HI> was
slaine in <HI>Peru</HI> by the hands of one <HI>Don Vaca de Castro.</HI></P>
<P>In the yéere 1543. in Ianuarie they departed from the
foresaid Islands with all the fléete, and had sight of certaine
Islands, out of which there came vnto them men in a cer∣taine
kinde of boats, and they brought in their hands crosses,
and saluted the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the <HI>Spanish</HI> toong saying, <HI>Bue∣nas
dias, Matelotes,</HI> that is to say, Good morrow, compani∣ons;
whereat the <HI>Spaniards</HI> much marueiled, being then so
farre out of <HI>Spaine,</HI> to sée the men of that countrey with cros∣ses,
and to be saluted by them in the <HI>Spanish</HI> toong, and they
séemed in their behauiour to incline somewhat to our Catho∣lique
faith. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> not knowing, that many there∣about
had béene Christened by <HI>Francis de Castro,</HI> at the com∣mandement
<PB N="94" REF="54"/>
of <HI>Antony Galuano,</HI> some of them named these
Islands,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Isles of Matelates.</NOTE> <HI>Islas de las cruzes,</HI> and others named them <HI>Islas de

<P>In the same yéere 1543. the first of February <HI>Rui Lopez</HI>
had sight of that noble Island <HI>Mindanao</HI> standing in 9. de∣grées:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mindanao.</NOTE> they could not double it nor yet come to an ancre as
they would, because the christened kings and people resisted
them, hauing giuen their obedience to <HI>Antonie Galuano,</HI>
whom they had in great estimation, and there were fiue or
sixe kings that had receiued baptisme, who by no meanes
would incurre his displeasure. <HI>Rui Lopez</HI> perceiuing this, and
hauing a contrary winde, sailed along the coast to finde some
aide;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sarangam.</NOTE> and in 4. or 5. degrées he found a small Island which
they of the countrey call <HI>Sarangam,</HI> which they tooke per∣force,
and in memory of the vizeroy who had sent them thi∣ther
they named it <HI>Antonia,</HI> where they remained a whole
yéere, in which time there fell out things worthie to be writ∣ten;
but because there are more histories that intreat of the
same I leaue them, meaning to medle with the discoueries
onely.</P>
<P>In the same yéere 1543. and in the moneth of August the
generall <HI>Rui Lopez</HI> sent ane <HI>Bartholmew de la torre</HI> in a smal
ship into new <HI>Spaine,</HI> to acquaint the vizeroy <HI>don Antonio de

Gaonata, Bisaia,</HI> and many others, standing in 11. and 12. de∣grées
towards the north, where <HI>Magellan</HI> had béene, and
<HI>Francis de Castro</HI> also, who there baptized many, and the
spaniards called thē the <HI>Philippinas</HI> in memory of the prince
of <HI>Spaine.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Philippinas.</NOTE> Here they tooke victuals and wood, and hoised
sailes, they sailed for certaine daies with a fore-winde, till it
came upon the skanting, and came right vnder the tropique
of <HI>Cancer.</HI> The 25. of september they had sight of certaine Is∣lands,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Malabrigos.</NOTE> which they named <HI>Malabrigos,</HI> that is to say, The euil
roads.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Las dos Her∣manas.</NOTE> Beyond them they discouered <HI>Las dos Hermanas,</HI> that

more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Los Volcanes.</NOTE> which they called <HI>los Volcanes.</HI> The second of October
they had sight of <HI>Farsana,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">La Farsana.</NOTE> beyond which there standeth an
high pointed rock, which casteth out fire at 5. places. So say∣ling
in 16. degrées of northerly latitude, from whence they
had come, as it seemeth wanting winde, they arriued againe
<PB N="95" REF="54"/>
at the Islands of the <HI>Philippinas.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sixe or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Islands more.</NOTE> They had sight of 6. or 7.
Islands more, but they ankered not at them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Archipelagus of Islands.</NOTE> They found also
an Archipelagus of Islands well inhabited with people, lying
in 15. or 16. degrées: the people be white, and the weomen
well proportioned, and more beautifull and better arraied
then in any other place of those parts, hauing many iewels
of gold, which was a token, that there was some of that me∣tal
in the same countrie. Here were also barkes of 43. cubits
in length, and 2. fathomes and a halfe in bredth, and the
plankes 5. inches thicke, which barkes were rowed with
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ares. They told the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that they vsed to saile in them
to <HI>China,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pilots for China.</NOTE> and that if they would go thither they should haue
pilots to conduct them, the countrie not being aboue 5. or 6.
daies sayling from thence. There came vnto them also cer∣taine
barkes or boates handsomely decked, wherein the Ma∣ster
and principall men sate on high, and vnderneath were
very blacke moores with frizled haire: and being demanded
where they had these black moores, they answered, that they
had them from certaine Islands standing fast by <HI>Sebut,</HI>
where there were many of them, a thing that the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
much maruailed at, because from thence it was aboue 300.
leagues to the places where the black people were. There∣fore
it seemed, that they were not naturally borne in that cli∣mate,
but that they be in certaine places scattered ouer the
whole circuite of the world. For euen so they be in the Islands
of <HI>Nicobar</HI> and <HI>Andeman,</HI> which stand in the gulfe of <HI>Benga∣la,</HI>
and from thence by the space of 500. leagues we doe not
know of any blacke people. Also <HI>Vasco Nunez de Valboa</HI>
declareth that as he went to discouer The South sea, in a cer∣taine
land named <HI>Quareca</HI> he found black people with frizled
haire, whereas there were neuer any other found either in
<HI>Noua Spagna,</HI> or in <HI>Castilia del Oro,</HI> or in <HI>Peru.</HI></P>
<P>In the yéere 1544. Don <HI>Gutierre de Vargas</HI> bishop of <HI>Pla∣cenza</HI>
sent a fléet from the city of <HI>Siuil</HI> vnto the streits of <HI>Ma∣gellan:</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gomara hist. gen. lib. 4. cap. 14.</NOTE> which is reported to haue béene done by the counsel
of the vizeroy <HI>Don Antonie de Mendoça</HI> his cousin. Some
suspe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed that they went to <HI>Maluco,</HI> others to <HI>China,</HI> others,
that they went onely to discouer the land betwixt the streite
and the land of <HI>Peru</HI> on the other side of <HI>Chili,</HI> because it was
reported to be very rich in gold and siluer. But this fléete by
<PB REF="55"/>
reason of contrary windes could not passeth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> streit, yet one
small barke passed the same, and sailed along the coast, and
discouered all the land, till he came vnto <HI>Chirimai,</HI> and <HI>Are∣quipa,</HI>
which was aboue 500. leagues, for the rest was alrea∣die
discouered by <HI>Diego de Almagro,</HI> and <HI>Francis Pizarro,</HI> and
their captaines and people at diuers times. By this it appée∣reth,
that from The streit to the Equinoctial line on both sides
is wholy discouered.</P>
<P>In the yéere 1545. &amp; in the moneth of Ianuarie <HI>Rui Lopez
de villa Lobos,</HI> and <HI>Giraldo</HI> with the <HI>Castilians</HI> came to the
Island of <HI>Moro,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Isle of Moro.</NOTE> and the citie of <HI>Camafo,</HI> where they were
well receiued of the kings of <HI>Gilolo</HI> and <HI>Tidore,</HI> and of the
people of the countrey (because <HI>Antony Galuano</HI> was gone)
and put the captaine <HI>Don George de Castro</HI> to great trouble,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Antonie Galua∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o gon out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Malucas.</NOTE>
as appéered by those things which passed betwéene him and
the <HI>Portugals,</HI> and the great expences whereunto he put the
fortresse.</P>
<P>In the same yéere 1545. <HI>Rui Lopez de villa Lobos</HI> sent
from the Island of <HI>Tidore</HI> another ship towards <HI>New Spaine</HI>
by the south side of the line, wherein was captaine one <HI>Inigo
Ortez de Rotha,</HI> and for pilot one <HI>Iaspar Rico.</HI> They sailed to
the coast of <HI>Os Papuas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Os Papuas.</NOTE> and ranged all along the same, and
because they knew not that <HI>Saauedra</HI> had béene there before,
they chalenged the honor and same of that discouerie. And be∣cause
the people there were blacke and had frisled haire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nueua Guinea.</NOTE> they
named it <HI>Nueua Guinea.</HI> For the memorie of <HI>Saauedra</HI> as
then was almost lost, as all things else do fall into obliuion,
which are not recorded, and illustrated by writing.</P>
<P>In this yéere 1545. and in the moneth of Iune, there
went a <HI>Iunk</HI> from the citie of <HI>Borneo,</HI> wherein went a <HI>Por∣tugall</HI>
called <HI>Peter Fidalgo,</HI> and by contrary windes he was
driuen towards the north; where he founde an Island stan∣ding
in 9. or 10. degrées, that stretched it selfe to 22. degrées of
latitude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Isle of Lu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ones.</NOTE> which is called The Isle of the <HI>Luçones,</HI> because the
inhabitants thereof were so named. It may haue some other
name and harborowes, which as yet we know not: it run∣neth
from the north vnto the southwest, and standeth be∣twéene
<HI>Mindanao</HI> and <HI>China.</HI> They say they sailed along by
it 250. leagues, where the land was fruitfull and well coue∣red,
and they affirme, that there they will giue two <HI>Pezos</HI> of
<PB REF="55"/>
gold for one of siluer:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> gold.</NOTE> and yet it standeth not farre from the
countrey of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>In the yéere 1553. there went out of <HI>England</HI> certaine
shipping, and as it appéered they sailed northward along the
coast of <HI>Norway</HI> and <HI>Finmark,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Moscouie disco∣uered by sea, by the English.</NOTE> and from thence east, till they
came betwéene 70. and 80. degrées vnto <HI>Moscouie,</HI> for so far
one of the ships went: but I know not what became of the
rest: &amp; this was the last discouery made vntil this time. From
this lande of <HI>Moscouie</HI> eastward you faile vnto <HI>Tartary,</HI>
and at the farther end of it standeth the countrey and pro∣uince
of <HI>China.</HI> It is said that betwéene <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Tartary</HI>
there is a wall aboue 200. leagues in length, standing néere
vnto 50. degrées of latitude.</P>
<P>Now I gather by all the precedent discoueries, that the
whole earth is in circuite 360. degrées according to the <HI>Geo∣metrie</HI>
thereof: and to euery degrée the ancient writers al∣low
17. leagues &amp; a halfe, which amount vnto 6300. leagues
yet I take it that euerie degrée is iust 17. leagues. Howso∣euer
it be, all is discouered and sailed from the east vnto the
west almost euen as the sunne compasseth it: but from the
south to the north there is great difference; for towardes the
north pole there is found discouered no more then 77. or 78.
degrées, which come to 1326. leagues: and towards the
south pole there is discouered from the Equinoctiall to 52.
or 53. degrées, that is, to the streit which <HI>Magellan</HI> passed
through, which amounteth to about 900. leagues; and put∣ting
both these saide maine sums togither, they amount to
2226. leagues. Now take so many out of 6300. leagues,
there remaineth as yet vndiscouered north and south aboue
the space of 4000. leagues.</P>
