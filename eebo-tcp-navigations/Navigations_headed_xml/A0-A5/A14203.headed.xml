<HI>England</HI> warres against the <HI>Block▪Ilanders,</HI> and that insolent and barbarous Nation, called the <HI>Pequeats,</HI> whom by the sword of the Lord, and a few feeble instruments, souldiers not accustomed to warre, were drove out of their Countrey, and slaine by the sword, to the number of fifteene hundred soules in the space of two moneths and lesse: so as their Countrey is fully subdued and fallen into the hands of the English: And to the end that Gods name might have the glory, and his peo∣ple see his power, and magnifie his honour for his great goodnesse I have indevoured accor∣ding to my weake ability, to set forth the full relation of the Warre from the first rise to the end of the victory.</P>
<P>The cause of our war against the <HI>Block Islan∣ders,</HI> was for taking away the life of one Master <HI>Iohn Oldham,</HI> who made it his common course trade amongst the Indians▪ he comming to <HI>Block-Island</HI> to drive trade with them, the Islanders came into his boate and having got a full view of commodities which gave them good content, consulted how they might de∣stroy him and his company, to the end they might cloth their bloody flesh with his law∣ful garments. The Indians having laid the plo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into the boate they came to trade as they pre∣tended watching their opportunities, knockt him in the head, &amp; martyred him most Barba∣rously, to the great griefe of his poore distres∣sed
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
servants, which by the providence of God were saved. This Island lying in the rode way to the Lord <HI>Sey,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Brookes</HI> plantation, a certaine Sea man called to <HI>Iohn Gallop</HI> Master of the <HI>Small navigation</HI> standing along to the <HI>Mathethusis Bay,</HI> and seeing a boate under saile close aboard the Island, and perceiving the sailes to be unskilfully mana∣ged, bred in him a jealously, whether that the Island Indians had not bloodily taken the life of our Countrie-men, and made themselves Master of their goods: suspecting this, he bore up to them and approaching neere them was confirmed that his jealousie was just, seeing Indians in the boate, and knowing her to be the vessel of Master <HI>Oldham,</HI> and not seeing him there gave fire upon them and slew some, o∣thers leaped over board; besides two of the number which he preserved alive and brought to the bay. The blood of the innocent called for vengeance, God stirred up the heart of the honoured Governour Master <HI>Henrie Vane</HI> and the rest of the worthy Magistrates to send forth a 100. well appointed Souldiers under the conduct of Captaine <HI>Iohn Hendicot,</HI> and in company with him that had command, Cap∣taine <HI>Iohn Vnderhill,</HI> Captaine <HI>Nathan Turner,</HI> Captaine <HI>William Ienningson,</HI> besides other in∣feriour Officers. I would not have the world wonder at the great number of Commanders <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o so few men, but know that the Indians fight
<PB REF="5"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arre differs from the Christian practise, for they most commonly divide themselves into small bodies, so that we are forced to neglect our usuall way and to subdivide our divisions to answer theirs, and not thinking it any dispa∣ragement, to any Captaine to go forth against an Enemy with a squaldron of men taking the ground from the old &amp; ancient practise when they chose Captaines of hundreds and Cap∣taine of thousands, Captaines of fifties and Captaines of tens: We conceive a Captaine signifieth the chiefe in way of Command of any body committed to his charge for the time being whether of more or lesse, it makes no matter in power though in honour it doth. Comming to an anckor before the Island we espied an Indian walking by the shore in a desolate manner as though he had received intelligence of our comming. Which Indian gave just ground to some to conclude that the body of the people had diserted the Island.</P>
<P>But some knowing them for the generality to be a warlike nation, a people that spend most of their time in the studie of warlike policy were not perswaded that they would upon so slender termes forsake the Island, but rather suspected they might lye behind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>anke, much like the forme of a Baracado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my selfe with others rode with a Shallop made towards the shore, having in the Boat a dozen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>med souldiers drawing neere to the place of

landing, the number that rose from behind the Barracado, were betweene 50. or 60. able fighting men, men as straite as arrowes, very tall, and of active bodyes, having their ar∣rowes nockt, they drew neere to the water side, and let flie at the souldiers, as though they had meant to have made an end of us all in a moment; they shot a young Gentleman in the necke thorow a coller for stiffenesse, as if it had beene an oaken boord, and entered his flesh a good depth; my selfe received an arrow through my coate sleeve, a second a∣gainst my Helmet on the forehead, so as if God in his providence had not moved the heart of my wife to perswade mee to carrie it along with me which I was un∣willing to doe, I had beene slaine. Give me leave to observe <HI>two things</HI> from hence first when the houre of Death is not yet come, you <HI>see God useth weake meanes to keepe his purpose unviolated.</HI> Secondly, let no man despise advise and Counsell of his wife though shee be a woman; it were strange to nature to thinke a man should be bound to fulfill the humour of a woman, what armes hee should carry, but you see God will have it so, that a woman should overcome a man: what with <HI>Dalilahs</HI> flattery, and with her mourn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ull teares they must and will have their desire, when the hand of God goes a long in the matter; and this is to accomplish his
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
owne will, therefore let the clamour bee quencht I daily heare in my eares, that <HI>New England</HI> men usurpe over their Wives, and keepe them in servile subjection: the Coun∣trey is wronged in this matter, as in many things else: let this president satisfie the doubtfull, for that comes from the example of a rude souldier: if they bee so curteous to their wives, as to take their advice in warlike matters, how much more kind is the tender affectionate husband to honour his wife as the weaker vessell? Yet mistake not, I say not that they are bound to call their wives in Councell, though they are bound to take their private advice (so farre as they see it make for their advantage and their good▪) in∣stance <HI>Abraham.</HI> But to the matter, the Ar∣rowes flying thicke about us, wee made hast to the shore, but the suffe of the Sea being great, hindered us, so as wee could scarce dis∣charge a Musket, but were forced to make hast to land▪ drawing neere the shore through the strength of wind, and the hollownesse of the Sea, wee durst not adventure to runne ashore, but were forced to wade up to the middle, but once having got up of our legges, wee gave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e upon them, they finding our bullets to out reach their arrowes, they fled before us; in the meane while Colonell <HI>Hindecot</HI> made to the shore, and some of this number also r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pul∣sed him at his landing, but hurt none▪ wee
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
thought they would stand it out with us, but they perceiving wee were in earnest, fled; and left their Wigwams or houses, and provision to the use of our souldiers: having set forth our Sentinels, and laid out our Pardues, wee betooke our selves to the guard, expecting hourely they would fall upon us; but they observed the old rule, 'tis good sleeping in a whole skin, and left us free from an alarum.</P>
<P>The next day wee set upon our march, the <HI>Indians</HI> being retired into Swamps, so as wee could not find them, wee burnt and spoyled both houses and corne in great abundance: but they kept themselves in obscuritie: Captaine <HI>Turner</HI> stepping aside to a Swampe, met with some few <HI>Indians,</HI> and charged upon them, changing some few bullets for Arrowes, him∣selfe received a shot upon the breast of his Corslet, as if it had beene pushed with a pike, and if hee had not had it on, hee had lost his life.</P>
<P>A prettie passage worthy observation, wee had an <HI>Indian</HI> with us that was an interpreter, being in English cloathes, and a Gunne in his hand, was spied by the Ilanders, which called out to him, what are you an Indian or an English-man: come hither, saith he, and I will tell you; hee pulls up his cocke and let fly at one of them, and without question was the death of him: Having spent that day in bur∣ning and spoyling the Iland, wee tooke up the
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
quarter for that night, about midnight my selfe went out with ten men about two miles from our quarter, and discovered the most eminent Plantation, they had in the Iland where was much corne, many Wigwams, and great heapes of mats; but fearing lest wee should make an alarum by setting fire on them; wee left them as wee found them, and peaceably departed to our quarter: and the next morning with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0. men marched up to the same Plantation, burnt their houses, cut downe their corne, destroyed some of their dogges in stead of men, which they left in their Wigwams.</P>
<P>Passing on toward the water side to im∣barque our souldiers, wee met with severall famous Wigwams with great heapes of plea∣sant corne ready shaled, but not able to bring it away, wee did throw their mattes upon it, and set fire and burnt it: many well-wrought mattes our souldiers brought from thence, and severall delightfull baskets: wee being divided into two parts, the rest of the body met with no lesse, I suppose, then our selves did. The Indians playing least in sight, wee spent our time, and could no more advantage our selves then wee had already done, and having slaine some fourteen, &amp; mai∣med others, wee imbarqued our selves, and set saile for <HI>Seasbrooke</HI> fort, where wee lay through distresse of weather foure dayes, then we departed.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="7"/>The <HI>Pequeats</HI> having slaine one Captaine <HI>Norton,</HI> and Captaine <HI>Stone,</HI> with seven more of their company, order was given us to visit them, sayling along the <HI>Nahanticot</HI> shore with five vessels, the Indians spying of us came running in multitudes along the water side, crying, what cheere Englishmen, what cheere, what doe you come for? They not thinking we intended warre went on cheerefully untill they come to Pequeat riuer. We thinking it the best way did forbeare to answer them; first, that we might the better bee able to runne through the worke. Secondly, that by de∣laying of them, we might drive them in secu∣ritie, to the end wee might have the more ad∣vantage of them: but they seeing wee would make no answer, kept on their course, and cryed, what English man, what cheere, what cheere, are you hoggerie, will you cram us? That is, are you angry, will you kill us, and doe you come to fight. That night the <HI>Na∣hanticot</HI> Indians, and the <HI>Pequeats,</HI> made fire on both sides of the River, fearing we would land in the night. They made most dolefull, and wofull cryes all the night, (so that wee could scarce rest) hollowing one to another, and giving the word from place to place, to gather their forces together, fearing the Eng∣lish were come to warre against them.</P>
<P>The next morning they sent early aboard an Ambassadour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Indians</HI> send to the <HI>English</HI> an Ambassador.</NOTE> a grave Senior, a man of good
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
understanding, portly, cariage grave, and ma¦jesticall in his expressions; he demanded of us what the end of our comming was, to which we answered, that the Governours of the <HI>Bay</HI> sent us to demand the heads of those persons that had slaine Captaine <HI>Norton,</HI> and Captaine <HI>Stone,</HI> and the rest of their company, and that it was not the custome of the English to suffer murtherers to live, and therefore if they desi∣red their owne peace and welfare, they will peaceably answer our expectation, and give us the heads of the murderers.</P>
<P>They being a witty and ingenious Nation, their Ambassadour laboured to excuse the matter, and answered, we know not that any of ours have slaine any English: true it is, saith he, we have slaine such a number of men, but consider the ground of it; not long before the comming of these <HI>English</HI> into the River, there was a certaine vessell that came to us in way of trade, we used them well, and traded with them, and tooke them to be such as would not wrong us in the least matter; but our <HI>Sachem</HI> or Prince comming aboord, they laid a plot how they might destroy him, which plot dis∣covereth it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lfe by the event, as followeth▪ they keeping their boat aboord, and not desi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous of our company, gave us leave to stand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ollowing a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hore, that they might worke their mischievous plot▪ but as wee stood they called to us, and demanded of us a bushell of
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>
<HI>Wampam Peke,</HI> which is their money, this they demanded for his ransome, this peale did ring terribly in our eares, to demand so much for the life of our Prince, whom we thought was in the hands of honest men, and wee had ne∣ver wronged them; but we saw there was no remedy, their expectation must be granted, or else they would not send him ashore, which they promised they would doe, if wee would answer their desires▪ wee sent them so much aboord according to demand, and they accor∣ding to their promise sent him ashore, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no wayes true of the <HI>Eng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish,</HI> but a devised ex∣cuse.</NOTE> but first slew him, this, much exasperated our spirits, and made us vow a revenge; suddenly after came these Captaines with a vessell into the River, and pretended to trade with us as the former did: wee did not discountenance them for the present, but tooke our opportu∣nity and came aboord. The <HI>Sachems</HI> sonne succeeding his Father, was the man that came into the Cabin of Captaine <HI>Stone,</HI> and Cap∣taine <HI>Stone</HI> having drunke more then did him good, fell backwards on the bed asleepe, the <HI>Sagamore</HI> tooke his opportunitie, and having a little hatchet under his garment, therewith knockt him in the head: some being upon the deck and others under, suspected some such thing, for the rest of the <HI>Indians</HI> that were a∣boord, had order to proceed against the rest at one time, but the <HI>English</HI> spying trecherie, runne immediatly into the Cooke roome, and
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>
with a fire-brand had thought to have blowne up the <HI>Indians</HI> by setting fire to the powder: these devils instruments spying this plot of the <HI>English,</HI> leaped over-boord as the powder was a firing, and saved themselves, but all the <HI>English</HI> were blowne up, this was the manner of their bloody action: Saith the Ambassa∣dour to us, could yee blame us for revenging so cruell a murder? for we distinguish not be∣tweene the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> but tooke them to be one Nation, and therefore we doe not conceive that we wronged you, for they slew our king; and thinking these Captaines to be of the same Nation and people, as those that slew him, made us set upon this course of revenge.</P>

<P>We did grant him liberty to get ashore, and our selves followed suddenly after before the Warre was proclaimed: hee seeing us land our forces, came with a message to intreat us to come no neerer, but stand in a valley, which had betweene us and them an ascent, that took our sight from them; but they might see us to hurt us, to our prejudice: thus from the first beginning to the end of the action, they carried themselves very subtilly; but wee not willing to bee at their direction marched up to the ascent, having set our men in battally; he came and told us he had inquired for the <HI>Sachem,</HI> that we might come to a parlie: but neither of both of the Princes were at home, they were gone to <HI>Long Iland.</HI></P>
<P>Our reply was, we must not be put off thus, we know the <HI>Sachem</HI> is in the Plantation, and therefore bring him to us, that we may speake with him, or else we will beat up the Drumme, and march through the Countrey, and spoyle your corne: His answer, if you will but stay a little while▪ I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eppe to the Plantation and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for them▪ wee gave them leave to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

many as we could come neere, firing their Wigwams, spoyling their corne, and many other necessaries that they had buried in the ground we raked up, which the souldiers had for bootie. Thus we spent the day burning and spoyling the Countrey, towards night imbarqued our selves the next morning, lan∣ding on the <HI>Nahanticot</HI> shore, where we were served in like nature, no <HI>Indians</HI> would come neere us, but runne from us, as the Deere from the dogges; but having burnt and spoyled what we could light on, wee imbarqued our men, and set sayle for the <HI>Bay,</HI> having ended this exploit came off, having one man wounded in the legge; but certaine numbers of theirs slaine, and many wounded; this was the sub∣stance of the first yeares service: now follow∣eth the service performed in the second yeare.</P>
<P>This insolent Nation, seeing wee had used much Lenitie towards them, and themselves not able to make good use of our patience, set upon a course of greater insolencie then be∣fore, and slew all they found in their way: they came neere <HI>Seabrooke</HI> fort, and made ma∣ny proud challenges, and dared them out to fight.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant went out with tenne armed men, and starting three <HI>Indians</HI> they changed some few shotte for arrowes; pursuing them an hundred more started out of the ambush∣ments,

and almost surrounded him and his company, and some they slew, others they maimed, and forced them to retreat to their Fort, so that it was a speciall providence of God that they were not all slaine: some of their armes they got from them, others put on the English clothes, and came to the Fort jee∣ring of them, and calling, come and fetch your English mens clothes againe; come out and fight if you dare▪ you dare not fight, you are all one like women, we have one amongst us that if he could kill but one of you more, he would be equall with God, and as the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> mans God is, so would hee be; this blas∣phemous speech troubled the hearts of the souldiers, but they knew not how to remedy it in respect of their weaknesse.</P>
<P>The <HI>Conetticot</HI> Plantation understanding the insolencie of the enemie to bee so great, sent downe a certaine number of souldiers un∣der the conduct of Captaine <HI>Iohn Mason</HI> for to strengthen the Fort. The enemy lying hovering about the Fort, continually tooke notice of the supplies that were come, and for∣bore drawing neere it as before: and Letters were immediatly sent to the <HI>Bay,</HI> to that Right worshipfull Gentleman, Master <HI>Henry Vane,</HI> for a speedy supply to strengthen the Fort.

and perplexity that lay upon the spirits of the poore garrisons. Upon serious considerati∣on the Governour and Councell sent forth my selfe with 20. armed souldiers to supply the necessitie of those distressed persons, and to take the government of that place for the space of three moneths: reliefe being come, Captaine <HI>Iohn Mason</HI> with the rest of his company returned to the Plantation againe: we sometimes fell out with a matter of twen∣tie souldiers to see whether we could discover the enemy or no; they seeing us (lying in am∣bush) gave us leave to passe by them, consi∣dering we were too hot for them to meddle with us; our men being compleatly armed, with Corslets, Muskets, bandileeres, rests, and swords (as they themselves related afterward) did much daunt them; thus we spent a matter of six weekes before we could have any thing to doe with them, perswading our selves that all things had beene well. But they seeing there was no advantage more to be had against the Fort, they enterprized a new action, and fell upon <HI>Water towne,</HI> now called <HI>Wethersfield</HI> with two hundred <HI>Indians</HI>; before they came to attempt the place, they put into a certaine River, an obscure small river running into the maine, where they incamped, and refreshed themselves, and fitted themselves for their ser∣vice, and by breake of day attempted their en∣terprise, and slew nine men, women and chil∣dren,
<PB N="18" REF="12"/>
having finished their action, they sud∣denly returned againe, bringing with them two maids captives, having put poles in their Conoos, as we put Masts in our boats, and up∣on them hung our English mens and womens shirts and smocks, in stead of sayles, and in way of bravado came along in sight of us as we stood upon <HI>Seybrooke</HI> Fort, and seeing them passe along in such a triumphant manner, wee much fearing they had enterprised some des∣perate action upon the <HI>English,</HI> wee gave fire with a peece of Ordnance, and shotte among their Conooes. And though they were a mile from us, yet the bullet grazed not above twentie yards over the Conooe, where the poore maids were; it was a speciall providence of God it did not hit them, for then should we have beene deprived of the sweet observa∣tion of Gods providence in their deliverance: we were not able to make out after them, being destitute of meanes, Boats, and the like: be∣fore wee proceed any further to a full rela∣tion of the insolent proceeding of this barba∣rous Nation, give me leave to touch upon the severall accommodations that belong to this <HI>Seybrooke</HI> Fort.</P>

<P>The truth is, I want time to set forth the excellencie of the whole Countrey; but if you would know the garden of <HI>New England,</HI> then must you glance your eye upon <HI>Hodsons</HI> river, a place exceeding all yet named, the Ri∣ver affords fish in abundance, as Sturgeon, Salmon, and many delicate varieties of fish that naturally lyes in the River, the onely place for Beaver that we have in those parts. <HI>Long Iland</HI> is place worth the naming, and

<P>I told you before, that when the <HI>Pequeats</HI> heard and saw <HI>Seabrooke</HI> Fort was supplied, they forbore to visit us: But the old Serpent according to his first malice stirred them up against the Church of Christ, and in such a furious manner, as our people were so farre disturbed, and affrighted with their boldnesse that they scarce durst rest in their beds: threat∣ning persons and cattell to take them, as in∣deed they did: so insolent were these wicked imps growne, that like the divell their com∣mander, they runne up and downe as roaring Lyons, compassing all corners of the Coun∣trey for a prey, seeking whom they might de∣voure: It being death to them for to rest without some wicked imployment or other, they still plotted how they might wickedly attempt some bloody enterprise upon our poore native Countrey-men.</P>
<P>One Master <HI>Tillie</HI> master of a Vessell, being

brought to an ankor in <HI>Conetticot</HI> River, went ashore, not suspecting the bloody-minded∣nesse of those persons, who fell upon him, and a man with him, whom they wickedly and barbarously slew; and by relation brought him home, tied him to a stake, flead his skin off, put hot imbers betweene the flesh and the skinne, cut off his fingers and toes, and made hatbands of them, thus barbarous was their cruelty: would not this have mo∣ved the hearts of men to hazard blood, and life, and all they had, to overcome such a wic∣ked insolent Nation? but Letters comming in∣to the Bay, that this attempt was made upon <HI>Wethersfield</HI> in <HI>Conetticot</HI> river, and that they had slaine nine men, women and children, and taken two maids captives, the Councell gave order to send supply.

Their hearts were much taken up with the consideration of Gods just displeasure to them, that had lived under so prudent meanes of grace as they did, and had beene so ungrate∣full toward God, and slighted that meanes, so that Gods hand was justly upon them for their remisnesse in all their wayes; Thus was their hearts taken up with these thoughts, the <HI>Indians</HI> carried them from place to place, and shewed them their Forts, and curious Wig∣wams, and houses, and incouraged them to be merry, but the poore soules, as Israel, could not frame themselves to any delight or mirth under so strange a King, they hanging their Harpes upon the Willow trees, gave their mindes to sorrow, hope was their chiefest food, and teares their constant drinke: behind the rocks, and under the trees, the eldest spent her breath in supplication to her God, and though the eldest was but young, yet must I confesse the sweet affection to God for his great kindnesse, and fatherly love she daily re∣ceived from the Lord, which sweetned all her sorrowes, and gave her constant hope, that God would not, nor could not forget her poore distressed soule and body, because, saith she, his loving kindnesse appeareth to mee in

so profitable, that Gods deare Saints are for∣ced to cry out, Thy loving kindnesse is better then life, then all the lively pleasures and pro∣fits of the world: better a prison sometimes and a Christ, then liberty without him: better in a fierie furnace with the presence of Christ, then in a Kingly palace without him: better in the Lyons denne, in the midst of all the roa∣ring lyons and with Christ, then in a doune bed with wife and children without Christ.

soule, as those that are in afflictions; but be∣ware of those thoughts, or else experience will teach all to recall, or to unwith those thoughts, for it is against the course of Scripture to wish for evill, that good might come of it, wee cannot expect the presence of Christ in that which is contrary to him, (a man laying himselfe open to trouble) but wee are rather to follow Christs example, <HI>Father not my will, but thy will bee done, in earth as it is in heaven</HI>; and when thou art brought thus, prostrate before the Lord like an obedient child, ready to suffer what hee will impose on thee; then if hee thinke good to trie us, wee may exclude no tryall, no captivitie though burdensome or tedious to nature, for they will appeare sweet and san∣ctified in the issue, if they bee of the Lords laying on: specially when the Lord is pleased to impose trouble on his in way of tryall (as hee said to <HI>Israel</HI> of old; I did it to prove you, and to see what was in your hearts) whether a soule would not doe as the foolish young man in the Gospel, cling more closer to his honour, or profit, or ease, or peace, or liberty, then to the Lord Iesus Christ: and therefore the Lord is pleased to exercise his people with trouble and afflictions, that hee might appeare to them in mercy, and reveale more cleerely his free grace unto their soules. Therefore consider deare brethren, and erre

not, neither to the right hand, nor to the left and bee not as <HI>Ephraim,</HI> like an untamed hei∣fer that would not stoope unto the yoke: but stoope to Gods afflictions if hee please to im∣pose them, and feare them not when they are from God. And know that Christ cannot be had without a crosse; they are inseparable▪ you cannot have Christ in his Ordinances, but you must have his crosse. Did ever any Christian reade, that in the purest Churches that ever were, that Christians were freed from the Crosse? was not the Crosse carried after Christ? and <HI>Andrew</HI> must follow Christ, but not without a Crosse; he must take it and beare it, and that upon his shoulders, implying, it was not a light crosse, but weighty: Oh let not Chri∣stians shew themselves to bee so forgetfull, as I feare many are, of the old way of Christ: case is come into the world, and men would have Christ and ease, but it will not be in this world; is the servant better then the master? no, he is not, neither shall he be. But you may demand what is meant by this crosse, wee meet with many crosses in the world, losses at home and abroad, in Church and Common wealth: what crosse doth Christ meane? was it a crosse to bee destitute of a house to put his head in? or was it his crosse, that hee was not so deliciously sed as other men? or to bee so meane, wan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing honour as others had? o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was it that his habit was not answerable to
<PB N="34" REF="20"/>
the course of the world, or to bee destitute of silver and gold, as it is the lot of many of Gods saints to this day: this was not the crosse of Christ, you shall not heare him complaine of his estate, that it is too meane, or his lodging too bad, or his garments too plaine; these were not the troubles of Christ, these are companions to the crosse. But the chiefe crosse that Christ had, was that the word of his Father could not take place in the hearts of those to whom it was sent, and suf∣fering for the truth of his Father, that was Christs crosse; and that is the crosse too, that Christians must expect, and that in the purest Churches: And therefore why doe you stand and admire at <HI>New England,</HI> that there should bee contentions there, and differences there, and that for the truth of Christ? Doe you not remember that the crosse followed the Church? hath it not beene already said that Christs crosse followed him, and <HI>Andrew</HI> must carry it: and that <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> will contend together for the truths sake? And doth not the Apostle say, contend for the truth (though not in a violent way?) doth not Christ say, I came not to bring peace but a sword? and why should men won∣der at us, seeing that troubles and con∣tentions have followed the purest Churches since the beginning of the world to this day? wherefore should wee not looke backe to the
<PB N="35" REF="20"/>
Scriptures, and deny our owne reason, and let that bee our guide and Platforme, and then shall wee not so much admire, when wee know it is the portion of Gods Church to have trou∣bles and contentions? and when we know al∣so it is God that brings them, and that for good to his Church; hath not God ever brought light out of darknesse, good out of evill? did not the breath of Gods Spirit sweetly breathe in the soules of these poore Captives which we now related? and doe we not ever find the greater the afflictions and troubles of Gods people bee, the more emi∣nent is his grace in the soules of his servants? You that intend to goe to <HI>New England,</HI> feare not a little trouble.</P>
<P>More men would goe to Sea, if they were sure to meet with no stormes: but hee is the most couragious souldier, that sees the battell pitcht, the Drummes beate an alarum, and Trumpets sound a charge, and yet is not afraid to joyne in the battell: shew not your selves cowards, but proceed on in your in∣tentions, and abuse not the lenitie of our no∣ble Prince, and the sweet libertie hee hath from time to time given to passe and repasse according to our desired wills: wherefore doe yee stoppe, are you afraid? May not the Lord doe this to prove your hearts, to see whether you durst follow him in afflictions or not? what is become of Faith? I will not

feare that man can doe unto me, saith <HI>David,</HI> no nor what troubles can doe, but will trust in the Lord, who is my God.</P>
<P>Let the ends and aimes of a man bee good, and hee may proceed with courage: the bush may bee in the fire, but so long as God ap∣peares to <HI>Moses</HI> out of the bush there is no great danger, more good then hurt will come out of it▪ Christ knowes how to honour him∣selfe, and to doe his people good, though it bee by contrary meanes, which reason will not fathome. Looke but to faith, and that will make us see plainly, that though afflicti∣ons for the present are grievous, as doubt∣lesse it was with these two captive Maides, yet sweet and comfortable is the issue with all Gods saints, as it was with them. But to goe on.</P>
<P>Having imbarqued <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our souldiers, wee weighed ankor at <HI>Seabrooke</HI> Fort, and set sayle for the <HI>Narraganset Bay,</HI> deluding the <HI>Pequeats</HI> thereby, for they expected us to fall into <HI>Pe∣queat</HI> River; but crossing their expectation, bred in them a securitie: wee landed our men in the <HI>Narraganset Bay,</HI> and marched over land above two dayes journey before wee came to <HI>Pequeat</HI>; quartering the last nights march within two miles of the place, wee set forth about one of the clocke in the morning, having sufficient intelligence that they knew nothing of our comming. Drawing neere to

the Fort yeelded up our selves to God, and intreated his assistance in so waightie an enterprize. We set on our march to surround the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 paragraph" DISP="〈1 paragraph〉"/></NOTE> Fort, Captaine <HI>Iohn Mason,</HI> approching to the West end, where it had an entrance to passe into it, my selfe marching to the South side, surrounding the Fort, placing the <HI>Indians,</HI> for wee had about three hundred of them without, side of our souldiers in a ring battalia, giving a vol∣ley of shotte upon the Fort, so remarkable it appea∣red to us, as wee could not but admire at the provi∣dence of God in it, that souldiers so unexpert in the use of their armes, should give so compleat a volley, as though the finger of God had touched both match and flint: which volley being given at breake of day, and themselves fast asleepe for the most part, bred in them such a terrour, that they brake forth into a most dolefull cry, so as if God had not fitted the hearts of men for the service, it would have bred in them a commiseration towards them: but every man being bereaved of pitty fell upon the worke without compassion, considering the bloud they had shed of our native Countrey-men, and how barbarously they had dealt with them, and slaine first and last a∣bout thirty persons. Having given fire, wee approa∣ched neere to the entrance which they had stopped full, with armes of trees, or brakes: my selfe appro∣ching to the entrance found the worke too heavie fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mee, to draw out all those which were strongly for∣ced in. We gave order to one Master <HI>Hedge,</HI> and some other souldiers to pull out those brakes, having this done, and laid them betweene me and the entrance, and without order themselves, proceeded first on the South end of the Fort: but remarkable it was to ma∣ny

or us; men that runne before they are sent, most commonly have an ill reward. Worthy Reader, let mee intreate you to have a more charitable opinion of me (though unworthy to be better thought of) then is reported in the other Booke: you may re∣member there is a passage unjustly laid upon mee, that when wee should come to the entrance, I should put forth this question: shall wee enter? others should answer againe; What came we hither for else? It is well knowne to many, it was never my practise in time of my command, when we are in garrison, much to consult with a private souldier, or to aske his advise in point of Warre, much lesse in a matter of so great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> moment as that was, which experience had often caught mee, was not a time to put forth such a que∣stion, and therefore pardon him that hath given the wrong information, having our swords in our right hand, our Carbins or Muskets in our left hand, we approched the Fort▪ Master <HI>Hedge</HI> being shot tho∣row both armes, and more wounded; though it bee not commendable for a man to make mention at any thing that might tend to his owne honour; yet because I would have the providence of God ob∣served, and his Name magnified, as well for my selfe as others, I dare not omit, but let the world know, that deliverance was given to us that command, as well as to private souldiers. Captaine <HI>Mason</HI> and my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> entring into the Wigwams, hee was shot, and received many Arrowes against his head-peece, God preserved him from any wounds; my selfe received a shotte in the lef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hippe, through a sufficient Buffe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that if I had not beene supplyed with such a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Arrow would have pierced through me;
<PB N="39" REF="22"/>
another I received betweene necke and shoulders, hanging in the linnen of my Head-peece, others of our souldiers were shot some through the shoulders, some in the face, some in the head, some in the legs: Captaine <HI>Mason</HI> and my selfe losing each of us a man, and had neere twentie wounded: most coura∣giously these <HI>Pequeats</HI> behaved themselves: but see∣ing the Fort was to hotte for us, wee devised a way how wee might save our selves and prejudice them, Captaine <HI>Mason</HI> entring into a Wigwam, brought out a fire-brand, after hee had wounded many in the house, then hee set fire on the West-side where he en∣tred, my selfe set fire on the South end with a traine of Powder, the fires of both meeting in the center of the Fort blazed most terribly, and burnt all in the space of halfe an houre; many couragious fellowes were unwilling to come out, and fought most despe∣rately through the Palisadoes, so as they were scor∣ched and burnt with the very flame, and were depri∣ved of their armes, in regard the fire burnt their very bowstrings, and so perished valiantly: mercy they did deserve for their valour, could we have had op∣portunitie to have bestowed it; many were burnt in the Fort, both men, women, and children, others for∣ced out, and came in troopes to the <HI>Indians,</HI> twentie, and thirtie at a time, which our souldiers received and entertained with the point of the sword; downe fell men, women, and children, those that scaped us, fell into the hands of the <HI>Indians,</HI> that were in the reere of us; it is reported by themselves, that there were about foure hundred soules in this Fort, and not above five of them escaped out of our hands. Great and dolefull was the bloudy sight to the view
<PB N="40" REF="23"/>
of young souldiers that never had beene in Warre, to see so many soules lie gasping on the ground so thicke in some places, that you could hardly passe along. It may bee demanded, Why should you be so furious (as some have said) should not Chri∣stians have more mercy and compassion? But I would referre you to <HI>Davids</HI> warre, when a people is growne to such a height of bloud, and sinne against God and man, and all confederates in the action, there hee hath no respect to persons, but harrowes them, and sawes them, and puts them to the sword, and the most terriblest death that may bee: some∣times the Scripture declareth women and children must perish with their parents; some-time the case alters: but we will not dispute it now. We had suffici∣ent light from the word of God for our proceedings.</P>
<P>Having ended this service, wee drew our forces together to battallia, being ordered, the <HI>Pequeats</HI> came upon us with their prime men, and let flye at us, my selfe fell on scarce with twelve or fourteene men to encounter with them; but they finding our bullets to outreach their arrowes, forced themselves often to retreate: when we saw wee could have no advantage against them in the open field, wee reque∣sted our <HI>Indians</HI> for to entertaine fight with them, our end was that we might see the nature of the <HI>In∣dian</HI> warre: which they granted us and fell out; the <HI>Pequeats, Narragansets,</HI> and <HI>Mohigeners</HI> changing a few arrowes together after such a manner, as I dare boldly affirme, they might fight seven yeares and not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill seven men: they came not neere one ano∣ther▪ but shot remote, and not point blanke, as wee often doe with our bullets, but at rovers, and
<PB N="41" REF="23"/>
then they gaze up in the skie to see where the Arrow falls, and not untill it is fallen doe they shoot againe, this fight is more for pastime, then to conquer and subdue enemies. But spending a little time this way, wee were forced to cast our eyes upon our poore maimed souldiers, many of them lying upon the ground, wanting food and such nourishable things as might refresh them in this faint estate: but we were not supplyed with any such things whereby wee might relieve them, but only were constrained to looke up to God, and to intreate him for mercy to∣wards them: most were thirsty but could find no wa∣ter; the provision wee had for food was very little; many distractions seized upon us at the present, a Chirurgion wee wanted, our Chirurgion not accu∣stomed to warre, durst not hazard himselfe where we ventured our lives, but like a fresh-water souldier kept aboord, and by this meanes our poore maimed souldiers were brought to a great straite and faint∣nesse, some of them swounding away for want of speedy helpe, but yet God was pleased to preserve the lives of them, though not without great miserie, and paine to themselves for the present. Distractions multiplying, strength and courage began to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ile with many. Our <HI>Indians</HI> that had stood close to us hi¦therto, were fallen into consultation, and were re∣solved for to leave us in a land wee knew not which way to get out: suddenly after their resolution, fiftie of the <HI>Narraganset Indians</HI> fell off from the rest re∣turning home. The <HI>Pequeats</HI> spying them pursued af∣ter them: then came the <HI>Narrag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ets</HI> to Captaine <HI>Mason,</HI> and my selfe, crying, oh helpe us now, or out men will bee all slaine we answered, how dare you

As yet we saw not our Pinaces sayle along, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eared the Lord had crost them, which also the master of the Barque much fea∣red.

Having received their desires, they freely promised, and gave up themselves to march along with us, where ever we would goe. God having eased us from that oppression that lay upon us, thinking wee should have beene left in great misery for want of our ves∣sels, we diverted our thoughts from going to that neck of land; and faced about, marching to the river where our vessels lay at ankor. One remarkable pas∣sage. The <HI>Pequeats</HI> playing upon our flankes; One Sergeant <HI>Davis,</HI> a pretty couragious souldier, spying something black upon the toppe of a rock, stepped forth from the body with a Carbine of three foot long, and at a venture gave fire, supposing it to bee an <HI>Indians</HI> head, turning him over with his heeles up∣ward; the <HI>Indians</HI> observed this, and greatly admi∣red that a man should shoot so directly. The <HI>Pequeats</HI> were much daunted at the shot, and forbore appro∣ching so neere upon us. Being come to the <HI>Pequeat</HI> river we met with Captaine <HI>Patrick,</HI> who under his command had 40. able souldiers, who was ready to begin a second attempt: but many of our men being maimed and much wearied, we forbore that night and imbarqued our selves, my selfe setting sayle for <HI>Sea∣brooke</HI> Fort. Captaine <HI>Mason,</HI> and Captaine <HI>Patrick</HI> marching over land, burned and spoyled the Coun∣trey betweene the <HI>Pequeat</HI> and <HI>Conetticot</HI> river, where we received them.

Suddenly after they spoy∣led all those goods they could not carry with them, broke up their tents and Wigwams, and betook them∣selves to flight. <HI>Sasachus</HI> flying toward <HI>Conetticot</HI> plan∣tation, quartered by the river side, there he met with a Shallop sent downe to <HI>Seabrooke</HI> Fort, which had in it 3. men, they let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly upon them, shot many arrows into them.
