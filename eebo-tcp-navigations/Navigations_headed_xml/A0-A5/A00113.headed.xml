Than Oly∣uer sayde to kinge Charlemayne, that he shoulde take againe the crown, and that he shoulde brynge to him Maw∣gys that he had taken, whan he was aboute to pylle the pauyllyon, for he a∣bode alone whan kynge Charlemai∣ne hearde the same: he tooke agayne his crowne, and was ryghte glad of the prise of mawgys. fol. cii.</P>

Wherof kynge Charlemayne was full sory. And therfore he sende worde to Reynawde that he shoulde sende to hym agayne his crowne and his swerde, and all that Mawgys had borne awaye with hym, and he shoulde graunt hym his truce for two yeres.

And whan he saw himselfe in Mountaw∣ban: he sware that he shoulde neuer make peace wyth Reynawde as longe as that he were prysoner. And so Reynawde dyd sende him againe vpon his horse bayard free and quite, wherof he repented him sore after∣warde. For soone after this, kyng Charlemayn made Mountawban to be besyeged of so nyghe: that he famy∣shed Reynawd and his bretherne, his wife and his children, and all the peo∣ple, so that they dyed for hungre and thirst, the most parte. fol. cxvii.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Ruelye we finde in the gestes &amp; faites of the good kynge Charlemayne that vpō a time at a feast of Penthecoste the sayde kyng Charle∣mayne kept a ryght great and solemp∣ne court at Parys, after that he was come againe fro the partyes of Lom∣bardy where he had had a ryght great and meruaylous batayle ayenst the Sarasyns, and suche folke as were oute of the beleue, wherof the cheef of the sayde Sarasins was named Gui∣thelym the sesne. The whiche the said kynge Charlemayne by hys prowesse and valyauntnes had dyscomfyted &amp; ouercomen. At the which battaylle and dyscomfyture dyed greate noble∣nesses of kinges, princes, Dukes, Er∣les, barons, knyghtes and squyers. As Salamon of bretayne. Huon erle of Mauns, syr yues, syr yuoyre beren∣ger, and Haton, syr Arnaulde of Be∣aulande, syr walleraunte of Bollon and many valyaunte knyghtes. The House peres of Fraunce were come there and many Almaynes and Eng∣lyshemenne. Normans Poeteuyns. Lombardes and Barnyers. And a∣monge other Dukes &amp; princes was come thyther. The good and worthye duke Aymes of Ardeyne. And in his felawshyp his foure fayre sonnes, that is to wyt Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nawde, Alarde, Guycharde, and Rycharde, that were wonderfull fayre, wytty, great, migh∣tye, and valyaunte, specyally Rey∣nawde whiche was the greatest and the tallest manne that was founde at that tyme in al the worlde. For he had xvi. feete of length and more. Than at this assemble and feast: stood the sayd kynge Charlemayne on his feete a∣monge his prynces and barons, say∣inge in this wyse, barons my brethe∣ren and freendes, ye knowe howe I haue conquested and gotten so manye greate londes by youre helpe and suc∣cours. So many of the Sarasins and misbeleuers brought to death, &amp; in my subieccion, how but late agoe ye haue seene by y<SUP>e</SUP> paynni Guerelym whiche I haue dyscomfyted &amp; ouercomen, and reduced to the christen faith. Notwith¦standynge
<PB REF="7"/> we haue loste there ryghte greate cheualry and noblenesse. And for faute of many of oure vassaylles and subiectes that to vs dayneth not to come, howe be it that we had sent for theym, as the Duke Rycharde of Roussellon, the duke Dron of Nan∣tuell, and the duke Benes of Aygre∣mounte, that been all three bretherne Germayne. Wherof vnto you I com∣playne me, and tell you that yf it we∣re not syr Salamon that worthylye came to succoure vs with .xxx. thou∣sande fygheynge menne, and syr Lam∣breyght bernyer and syr Geffraye of Bourdelle with walleraunce of Bul∣lon that bare our baner: we were alle dyscomfyted and lost as ye all knowe wel, and this by the defaut of the said three bretherene that dayned neuer to come to our sendynge, nor obey, and aboue all the duke Benes of Aygre∣mounte. All be it that they be all oure lyege menne that euer owen to me ser∣uyce and fydelytie. Now I shal sende hym worde that he come to serue me at this nexte somer with all his po∣wer. And in case that he shall be refu∣synge to obeye oure commaundemen∣tes: by saynt denys of fraunce I shall sende for al my freendes and subiectes and I shall goe besyege him at Aygre∣mounte. And yf we can haue him: I shall make him to be shamefully han∣ged and his sonne Mawgis to be slai∣ne all quycke, and shall do brenne his vncourteous wyfe. And I shall sert all his londes in fyre. Than the good Duke Naymes of Bauyere rose vp dyligently and said to kynge Charle∣mayne in this wyse. Syr me semeth that ye ought not to angre your selfe so sore. And yf ye will beleue my coun∣sell: ye shal sende a messanger to the duke of Aygremount which messan∣ger shal be wel and honourably accom¦panied. And he muste be sage and pru∣dent, for to shewe wel to the Duke of Aygremounte all that ye shal charge hym. And after whan ye shall know hys answere and his wyll: ye shall than aduyse you what ye oughte for to doo. In good fayth sayde the kyng, ye counseylle me ryght well and wi∣selye. Than thoughte Charlemayne what message he myght sende to him. And than he sayde all hyghe afore them all, complayninge himselfe who shall be he that shall doo thys messa∣ge. And for doubte of deathe shall not leue nothynge vnsayd of hys message to the duke benes, but there was no∣ne of them all that oughte answered. For manye of theim were of Sybbe to hym. As the duke Aymon of Ardeyne that was his brother Germayne.</P>
<P>Thus were the foure brethern of one father and of one mother. Than was kynge Charlemayne ryghte wrothe and angrye. And sware by saynte de∣nys that the Duke benes shoulde be wasted and destroyed. And no manne shoulde be in the worlde that shoulde keep him therfro. Than he called high his eldest sonne Lohier saying in this maner, ye must doo this message my dere sonne, and lede with you for your conduyt and suretye an hundred kni∣ghtes armed and honourably arayed, And ye shall saye to the Duke benes of Aygremounte that yf he come not for to serue vs thys somer aboute saynte Iohans daye nexte comynge as I haue saide afore: that I shall be∣syege
<PB N="ii" REF="7"/> Aygremounte &amp; shall dystroye all his lande and he and his I shal doo hange or slea al quycke, and his wyfe to be brente. Syr sayd Lohier al at your pleasure. I shal doo. And wit y<SUP>t</SUP> it shall not be taryed, for feare of death, but that I shal tell him al a longe all that ye haue charged me of. And I shall depart to morow in the mornyng by the grace of God.</P>
<P>Than should you haue sene y<SUP>e</SUP> king weepe of pitie for his sonne Lohier For he repented him y<SUP>t</SUP> he had char∣ged him for to doo this message, but syn y<SUP>t</SUP> he had so sayd: he must doo it. And the morne was come Lohier &amp; his noble company made them re∣dy and after lept on horsbacke, and came afore y<SUP>e</SUP> kyng. Than sayd Lo∣hier to the king his father. Syr here I am redye and all my folke for to fulfyll your wyll. Fayre sonne sayd Charlemayne I recōmend thee vn∣to god that on y<SUP>e</SUP> crosse suffred death and passion, and hym I beseche to kepe and waraunt thee &amp; al thy fe∣lawshyp from euyl &amp; from any com∣braunce, than departed Lohier and his company, wherof after warde the kynge made great lamentacyon for his sonne Lohier, and not wyth out a cause. For he shal neuer see hī quicke agayne as ye shal vnderstād yf ye wyll kerken it. Now go the gē∣till messangers streyght to warde Aygremount, sore thretenynge the duke Benes of Aygremoūt, saying that they should take the head from the body of hym yf he doo ought to them agaynst his deuoyre. But it shal go all other wyse w<SUP>t</SUP> them. For it haped all contrary to theyr myn∣des and purpose wherof afterward many ladyes abode widowes w<SUP>t</SUP>out husbādes, &amp; many gentil womē with out a louer. And so many churches destroyed, and so many landes brēte and wasted; wherof it is yet pitie for to see. And thus ridinge &amp; thretynge Benes of Aygremount, a spy heard all that they sayd, and came hastelye to Aygremo sit to ward Benes that was in his Palays and tolde hym how messāgers were coming vnto hym from kyng Charlemayne that sore thretened him, and that the sōne of kyng Charlemayne was there in person. Than sayd the Duke to hys folke wherof he had at that houre fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> son with him in his Palays bicause of the feast of Penthecoste. Lordes sayd he, the kynge Charlemayne set∣teth lytle by me, that will that I shal go serue him with all my power and my puyssance, and that wors is, he sendeth to me his eldest sonne for to tel me some message y<SUP>e</SUP> threteneth me greatly, what counsell ye me therto my bretherne &amp; freendes. Than sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ke a good knyght that was called syr Simon, &amp; sayd. My lorde I shal counsel you truly yf ye wyll herken and beleue me. Receyue honourably the messangers of the kynge Char∣lemayne. For wel ye wote that he is your ryght wyse lorde, and wit that who y<SUP>t</SUP> warreth against his souerayn Lorde: he doth agaynst god &amp; rayson and haue no regarde to your kynne nor to thys that your bretherne Gy∣rarde of Roussyllon and the duke of Nantuell wolde not obey hym. For I aduyse you wel that Charlemayn is myghty, and he shall distroye you
<PB REF="8"/> of body and of goodes, but yf that ye obey him. And yf ye amiablie go to hym, he shall haue mercy of you. Than answered the duke that thus he wolde not doo, and that the sayd knight gaue him euill counsell. For yet sayd he I am not so low brought but that I haue three brythren that shall helpe to susteine and beare out my warre agaynst Charlemayne, &amp; also my foure neuewes the sonnes of my brother Aymes of Dordon y<SUP>t</SUP> ben full fayre knightes, worthy and wel taught in faytes of warre. Alas sayd than y<SUP>e</SUP> duchesse. My good lorde beleue your good counsell. For no men shall prayse you that ye make warre agaynst your right wyse lorde, and wit it well that it is agaynst the cōmaundementes of God, &amp; against all equitie. Wherfore yf ye haue mis∣doone any thīg agaynst hym, doo so much y<SUP>t</SUP> ye be accorded w<SUP>t</SUP> him. And take none heed to your brethern, as syr Symon dothe counsell you. For neuer good may come therof for to be euyl in fauoure w<SUP>t</SUP> his souerayne Lorde. Than behelde the duke the duchesse in great wrathe and had her that she should holde her peace in y<SUP>e</SUP> deuilles name, &amp; that she should ne∣uer more speake to hym of this ma∣ter. For in certayne he should not do for the kyng Charlemayne the moū¦tenaunce of a peny. So helde her pe∣ace y<SUP>e</SUP> duchesse &amp; sayd that she should speake nomore to hym therof.</P>
<P>GReat was the noyse and the bruyte within the palayce of Aygremount, for some counselled the duke, that thus as the duchesse sayd: he should doo, and many other sayd nay. Than sayd the duke vnto them that counselled him naye and that he should not accorde nor make peace with the kyng Charlemayne, that he could theym thanke, muche longe they spake of this mater. And the messangers of the Kyng Charle∣mayne duryng the same haue riden so muche that they ben come to Ay∣gremount. And the castell was see vpon a roche ryght hye and well en¦uyroned with stronge walles thycke highe and wel garnyshed with great towres, so that for the strength and sytuacyon of the castell, it was im∣prenable, but only by famyshynge.</P>
<P>Than sayd Lohier to y<SUP>e</SUP> lordes that were wyth hym. Lordes nowe see what a fortresse is there, what wal∣les what a ryuer tēneth at the foote of it? I beleue verely that in al chris∣tendome is not her lyke. It can ne∣uer betake by force, but yf it is by fa∣mysshyng. Thā spake a knight that was called Sauary and sayd to Lo∣hier his lorde, syr sayde he it semeth me (spekynge vnder correccion) that my lorde the kynge Charlemayne your father hath enterprised a great foly, whan he troweth to come to at an ende of this duke of Aygremoūt for in good sothe he is right puissaūt And I beleue that he shall make as mani men for to make the warre, as shall my lorde your father yf it cam there to that he wolde make hym warre. It were a fayre thynge yf they myght be accorded together, and of my parte I shoulde counsell the same yf it myght be doone.</P>
<P>But well I wot that yf your father
<PB N="iii" REF="8"/> had hym, al y<SUP>e</SUP> golde in Paris should not kepe hym, but that he should do hange hym or els slea hym quycke. So beseche I you ryght deere syr y<SUP>t</SUP> ye speake humbly vnto the duke be∣nes of Aygremoūt. For in certayne he is ryght fyers and outragyous &amp; incontinent might haue there a sore meddle betwene you and hym, wher of the losse should tourne vpon vs. For we ben to lew folke. Than an∣swered Lohier and sayd to hym that he sayd well and wysely, but alway∣es sayd he we doubt hym not of any thynge. We be here al redy an hōdred knyghtes well appoynted, and for sothe yf he say vnto vs anye thynge vnto our dyspleasure: he shalbe the fyrst that shall repent and be sory for it. Than sayd the knight Sauare al softly to hymself, that this were not wysely doone. For wel I swere said he vpon my fayth that yf it hap you to say any thyng to hym that by any maner shall displease hym: he shall make you sorye and shall wreke it vpon you bodye. And happelye we shall all be in a waye for to dy. Syr aduyse your selfe well &amp; wyll to pro∣cede prudently in your message.</P>
<P>For well I say vnto you that he is ryght cruell, and of greate worthy∣nesse accomplysshed.</P>
<P>THus spekyng of one thyng and of other rode so longe the mes∣sangers, that they ben come to the gate of the castel which was sone shet by the porter, then knocked the sayd knightes, and the porter answe¦red to them. Lordes what be you?</P>
<P>Freende answered Lohier open to vs this gate presently. For we wyll speake to the Duke Benes of Aigre¦mount from the kinge Charlemayn Now abyde you a lytle and hast you not sayd the porter. And I wyl goe speake redely to my lorde the Duke. So went the sayde porter into the halle where he sawe the Duke his lorde. He kneeled incontynent afore him &amp; tolde him howe downe at the gate was a right great company of men of armes. And that they were well an hondred men or more ryght well horsed &amp; well armed, and with them is the eldest sonne of king char¦lemayne y<SUP>t</SUP> strongly threteneth you, and also your folke. My lorde sayde the porter shall I open the gates vn¦to thē, yea sayd y<SUP>e</SUP> duke For I doubt them nothynge, and we ben ynough for them. And many worthy knygh∣tes and esquyers ben no where able for to defende vs all, were Charle∣mayne himself with them with hys puissaūce. So ran incontinēt the por¦ter downe agayne for to open vnto them the gate. Lohier &amp; his felowes entred w<SUP>t</SUP>in and mounted vp vnto the dongeon of the castell where the duke was that sayd to hys barons. Lordes heere cometh the eldest sonne of the kyng Charlemayne for to tell me his message. But (di y<SUP>t</SUP> god y<SUP>t</SUP> suf∣fred death and passyon) Yf he speake wysely to vs he shal do as sage. And yf he sayth any thyng that shall dys∣please vs, we shall soone &amp; without delaye take vengeaunce therof. So was the duke Benes well accom∣panyed &amp; nobly of wel two hondred knyghtes &amp; more. Thys was in the moneth of May that all creatures
<PB REF="9"/> humain ought wel for to reioyce thē and that folke preu and worthy in armes taken hert and hardinesse for to defende them self wel, and warre agaynst theyr enemyes. And this du¦ring: Lohier the sonne of King char∣lemayne entred into the halle of the Palays of Aygremount ryght no∣bly armed and his folke also, and saw the halle ryght well garnyshed of fayre folke rychelye arayed. And the duke sittynge right proudlye a∣monge his barons, and the duchesse hys wyfe next by hym, and before hym his sonne Mawgys that was a great mayster of the science of Ni∣gromancy that played afore his fa∣ther of his art of nigromancy, wher¦in the Lordes that were there tooke great pleasure. And wit it well that in all the worlde was not a wor∣thyer chrysten, nor more able, than was the sayd Mawgys. Except on∣lye hys cosyn Reynawde one of the Sonnes of Aymon, wherof specyal∣ly treateth now this History. Than marched forthe Lohier and wente in the fyrst of all, and after hym hys folke by good conduyte. And salued the duke B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nes of Agremount in thys wyse, wherby moch great euill happed vnto him at last. That God that created y<SUP>e</SUP> firmament and made all thynge of nought for the people to susteyne. And on the crosse suffred death and passyon for all soules to be redemed out of the paynes of hel: keep and saue the king Charlemay∣ne Emperour of Aimayne and king of Fraunce and all hys noble lyne and confound thee Duke Benes of Aygremounte. My father the kyng by me expressely sēdeth to thee word thou come incontinent to Paris w<SUP>t</SUP> fyue hondred knyghtes for to do to him right and reason of thys that thou were not wyth him in armes in the partyes of Lumbardy for to fyght agaynst the enemyes of the christen fayth. Where by thy faute were dead there Bawdoyne lorde of Melanke. Gesfroi of Bourdel, and many other great Dukes Prynces knyghtes and barons. And yf thou wylt not doo it: I tell thee (duke be∣nes) that the kinge shall come vpon thee wyth an hundred thousand men of armes. So shalt thou be take and brought into Fraunce. And there y<SUP>u</SUP> shalt be iudged as a theefe and a fal∣se traytour vnto thy Souerayne Lorde, for to be slayne and hanged all quicke, thy wyfe brente and thy chyldren destroyed and banysshed.</P>
<P>Doo therfore this that I commaūd thee in the kinges behalfe, for thou knowest well that thou arte his mā vassayle and subiecte.</P>
<P>WHan the Duke Benes of ay¦gremount had heard Lohy∣er thus speake: Than yf ye had sene hym chaunged hys coloure pouffe &amp; blowe, as a mā cruel, proude and outrageouse, and sayd to Lohier in thys maner. I shal not goe to kynge Charlemayne nor nothynge of hys wyll I shall not fulfyll. For I hold nother Castell ne Fortresse of hym, but I shall goe vpon him with all my puyssaunce, and shall destroy all the lande of Fraunce vnto Parys. Than sayd Lohier vnto Duke Be∣nes
<PB N="iiii" REF="9"/> of Aygremount. Vassayle sayde he how darest thou answere thus?</P>
<P>And it the king knew now that thou thretenest hym thus as thou doest: he should come incontynent vpon thee, and should vtterli destroy thee, well thou knowest that thou arte hys liege man, and that thou canne not say agaynst it, come than redely and serue thy souerayne lorde kinge Charlemyan, and beleue me yf thou wyll saue thyne owne lyfe. For if y<SUP>u</SUP> doo it not: I make thee sure and cer∣tayne y<SUP>t</SUP> yf he can haue thee by force that he shall make thee to be hanged there as the ayre and the wyndes w<SUP>t</SUP> theyr great blastes shall dry vp the bones of thee. Whan the duke heard Lohier speake to him in this maner he stode vp anon vpon his feete, and sayd, y<SUP>t</SUP> to his euel chere he cam there for to make to hī hys message. Thā came foorth a knyght named syr wa¦ter that was a man of the Duke of Aygremount and sayd to the Duke My lorde keep for gods loue that ye doo no foly. Let Lohier say all hys wyll, for ye be neuer the worse for his sayenge, and as ye well knowe kynge Charlemayne is ryght puys∣saūt and so moche that there is no∣ther castell, Citie, nor towne neuer so stronge that can holde agaynst hī, Go than to him by my counsell, for ye be his man his vassayle &amp; his sub¦iect, and of hym you holde your cas∣tell of Aygremount and all your lā∣des, and yf ye so doo: ye shall doo as sage, and it shall be your prouffyte, &amp; also of al your lande, and for to war agaynst your ryght wise Lorde, no∣thyng but euil can come to you there¦of. Whan the Duke had hearde the wyse knyght to speake: he coulde to him right good thanke therfore, but alwayes all angry he sayd to hym, holde your peace. For I shall holde nothyng of hym aslonge that I shal may beare armes, and moūte a horse backe. I shall sende for my deere bre¦therne Gerrade of Roussyllon, and Dron of Natuell, and Garnyer his sonne, and than we shal gone vpon kyng Charlemayne, and yf I canne mete with him in any place: we shall destroy hym, &amp; shall doo of hym that he troweth to doo of me. Wene he y<SUP>t</SUP> I am a cowarde? nay by my faythe, for I should not take all the gold in Parys but that I should slea y<SUP>e</SUP> mes∣sanger. Euyll was to hym whan he durst so threten me. And than sayde Lohier, I nether prayse you nor do∣ubt you not. Whan the Duke benes of Agremount vnderstode Lohyer: he wexed for great wrathe as red as ony fyre in hys face, and began to ryse vp and to call. Nowe Barons vpon hym, brynge hym to me, for he shall neuer be wraunted but that I shall make hym to dye shamefullye. And the barōs durst not say against theyr lorde, but drew al theyr swer∣des. And incontynent did ren vpon Charlemaynes folke. And Lohier called his baner, and than began he and his folke to defende them selfe sharpely. And god knoweth howe many heades and armes were there cut of y<SUP>t</SUP> day. For at the same houre: began a thynge, wherof afterwarde so manye ladyes and damoyselles were w<SUP>t</SUP> out husbandes &amp; wythout louers, so many of children father∣lesse,
<PB REF="10"/> and so manye chirches wasted and distroyed that neuer sythe were repayred. What shal I tel you more? wyt it that they fought there so longe wythin the halle of the Pa∣lays: that the noys went through all the towne. Thā should ye haue seen the bourgeys, Marchauntes, &amp; men of craft with axes swerdes and other wepyns, and came to the Castel war¦de aboute seuen thousand men and more. But the entre of the Palays of Aygremount was narow, and y<SUP>e</SUP> Frenche men were within that kept them well that they entred not in at theyr case. Alas what terryble and vnhappy a slaughter was there that daye. For the folke of kyng Charle∣mayne were but a few to the regard of them of the other parte. And as ye may knowe suche assemble was ryght euyll. So defended them selfe moche noblye and valyauntlye the folke of kyng Charlemayne and so muche that Lohier seynge that, that he and hys folke had the worse: he smote a knight by fore y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Be∣nes of Aygremount by suche a wyse that he ouerthrew hym downe dead forth sayd he gods curse haue thou, and afterward he sayd pyteously in waylyng himselfe. Lorde God that within the holy wombe of the bles∣sed vyrgyn Marye tooke thy her∣bowrynge and suffred death &amp; pas∣syon for to redeme mankynde, wilt defende me thys daye from shame∣full death and from tourment, for I wot well, but yt it be that your hygh diuynitie socoure me this day: I shall not see y<SUP>e</SUP> king Charlemayne my father no more. Than the Duke called hygh vpon hym sayenge, Lo∣hier so helpe me God thys day shall be your laste. It shall not be so sayde Lohyer. And with this he smote the Duke vpon the head, but hys helme saued hym. And the stroke descended to the heele of him so that the bloud ranne out. By God sayd Lohier ye shall not escape. Than came the du∣ke Benes of Aigremount to him as woode and sore an angred, sayinge I should prayse my selfe full lytle it I might not auenge me vpon thee. So heaued vp the Duke hys brande of steele and smote Lohyer so harde vpon hys bryght helme that he cle∣ued hym to the teeth. And Lohyer fell dead afore hym. vpon the paue∣ment of the Halle. Ha God what great domage hath done the Duke Benes of Aygremoūt to haue thus slayne Lohier the eldest sonne of the great kyng Charlemayne. Forafter¦warde al the oste of Fraunce was in moche great and innumerable tour¦mente therfore and in ryght greate payne continual, and the Duke him¦selfe dyed therfore, full soryly. That was the payment that he had for it, as ye here after shall heare yf peasy∣bly ye wyll heare me.</P>
<P>NOw is outrageouslye slayne the good Lohyer the eldest sonne of kinge Charlemayne And y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Benes of Aygremount full of cruelnes tooke the hed from the bo¦dy of hym. And after that the folke of the sayd Lohyer the sonne of the great kyng Charlemayne saw thei. Lorde dead: thynke ye they made no great defence. Alwayes of a hūdred
<PB N="v" REF="10"/> that they were entred within the pa∣lays with theyr Lord Lohyer abode there on lyue but .xx. wherof y<SUP>e</SUP> duke incontynente made .x. of them to be slayne, and the other .x. he reteyned a lyue, and to them sayde, yf ye wyll promyse and sweare to me vpō your othe and fayth of knighthode that ye shall beare your Lorde Lohyer to hys father the Kyng Charlemayne, and say to hym that I sende to hym his sonne Lohyer in good aray, and that in an euyll houre he dyd sende hym to me for to tell me suche wor∣des, I shall let you goe quyte and saute, and to hym ye shall saye that for hym I shall not doo the mounte∣naunce of a Peny, and that I shall go vpon hym in thys Sommer next comynge wyth fourtye thousande men, and that I shall destroye hym and all hys lande. They answered, Syr wee shall doo that, that shall please you to commaunde vs. Thā the Duke dyd doo make redyly a by∣ere, and made the corps of Lohyer to be put wythin the sayd byere. And after he delyuered it to his .x. knigh¦tes that were left on lyue and put it in a carte to drawe wyth two hor∣ses. And the Duke conueyed theym thorough the Towne. And whan they were in the feeldes: the .x. knigh∣tes beganne to weepe and to make great mone for theyr Lorde Lohier saying, alas my lorde Lohier what shall wee no we saye for you to the Kynge your father that so great so∣rowe shall haue, whan he shal kno∣we your cruell death. We may well be incertayne that, that he shall ma∣ke vs all dye. Thus weepynge and makynge theyr mone for the loue of theyr Lorde Lohyer, the rode on theyr way streyght to Parys.</P>
<P>¶ But nowe we shall heere leaue to speake of the messangers and shall tell you of the Kynge Charlemayne that was at Parys.</P>
<P>CHarlemayne that was at Pa∣rys with a great multitude of Lordes that were there assembled.</P>
<P>And there vpon a day kynge Char∣lemayne sayd vnto hys Lordes and barons. Lordes I am moch wroch and sory of my sonne Lohyer that I haue sente to Aygremounte, and I feare me sore that they haue take de¦bate wyth the duke Benes of Agre∣mounte, whiche is fell, and cruell, &amp; I doubte me leste, he hath slayne my sonne Lohier. But by my crowne yf he haue so doone, or any thynge that turneth to dyspleasure or dommage to my sayd sonne: I shal go vpō him wyth a hundred thousand men and shall make hym to be hanged at a¦gybet. Syr sayd the good Duke Ay∣mes of Dordonne, I shall comē you ryght sore, yf he hath offēded against you that ye make punyssyon therof and wreke on hym greate venge∣aunce. He is your liege man, and ought to serue, prayse and honoure you. Alwayes yf he hath trespas∣sed agaynst you in any manere I am ryght sorye for it, and yf ye haue a cause to be wrothe wyth hym, I haue heare my foure sonnes, That
<PB REF="11"/> is to wyt Reynawde Alarde Guy∣charde and Rycharde, that ben ry∣ght valyaunt as ye syr well knowe which shalbe trusty and true to you. Aymon sayd the kyng Charlemayn I conne you great thanke of the of∣fre that nowe ye haue doone to me.</P>
<P>And it is my wyll that ye make thē to come hether presently to the ende that I make them knightes, and I shall gyue to them Castelles, tow∣res and Townes, and Cities ynou¦gh. Than sent the duke Aymes In∣continent for hys children, and made them to come afore kynge Charle∣mayne. And whan the king Charle∣mayne saw them: they pleased him moche, and Reynawde was the first that spake and sayd. Syr yf it please yon for to make vs knyghtes, we shalbe euer redy for to serue you and your noble Lordshyp. Thā the king Charlemayne called hys stewarde and sayd to hym. Bringe to me the armes that were the kynge Cedres whyche I haue wyth my handes slayne in batayle before Pampelune and shall gyue theym to the gentyll Reynawde as to hym that is as I wene the moste valyaunt of all, and of other good armes I shall gyue to the other three bretherne. So brou∣ght there the stewarde y<SUP>e</SUP> armes that were full fayre and riche, and than were armed the foure gentyl brethrē children to the good Aimes of dordō∣ne, and Ogyer of Denmarke that was of theyr kynne dyd on theyr spurres to the new knight Reynaw¦de, &amp; the kynge Charlemayne gyrde hym his swearde, and than doubed him to a Knighte sayinge God en∣creace in thee goodnes, honour, and worthines. And than mounted Rei∣nawde on horsbacke vpon Bayard that was suche a horse, that neuer was his like in all the world nor ne∣uer shall be except Busifal the horse of the great Kinge Alexander. For as for to haue ronne .xxx. myle toge∣ther he wolde neuer haue sweted.</P>
<P>The sayd Bayard thys horse was growen in the Isle of Boruscā, and Mawgys the sonne of the duke Be∣nes of Aygremount had gyuē to his cosin Reynawde, that after made the Kynge Charlemayne full wrothe and sory, as ye shal now heare here after.</P>
<P>REynawde was a horse backe w<SUP>t</SUP> a Sheelde paynted hangyng at his necke, and thwerled his swer∣de by great fyersnesse. And wyt wel that he was a fayre knight woun∣derful great and well founded, and of hym was a fayre syght, for well he semed one of the moste valyaunt Knightes that men coulde fynde in all the worlde. And the Barons that were there sayde. Ha god what a fayre Knight is he? Neuer was nor shall be sene so fayre a man of ar¦mes as Reynawde, god encrease to hym honour and worthynesse, good∣nes and pryse. And after were moche honourably and worthily a∣rayed and armed the other three bre∣therne of Reynawde, and sith lyght all on horsebacke vnder Saint Vic∣tor nyghe Parys. Than made the kinge Charlemayne to set vp in the
<PB N="vi" REF="11"/> grounde a poste agaynst whyche he made the new knightes for to assaye them selfe. They Iusted moche wor∣thely, but Reynawde Iusted best v∣pon his horse bayarde, &amp; ryght well lyked and were a greable vnto char¦lemayne the faytes of the valyaunt knyght Reynawde, vnto whome the king sayd, Reynawde frō hens forth ye shal come with vs in batayle and Reynawde answered him in thys maner. Syr god yelde it you an hun¦dred thousand tymes, and I promit you in good fayth to obey and serue you truly. Nor neuer ye shall fynde my selfe in no forfayte, but yf it com of you.</P>
<P>THe Emperour Charlemaine after the Iustynge was do∣one: he retourned to his Palays in Parys. Than he resoned wyth hys prynces and Barōs, and there were the duke Naymes of bauyres Oger the dane and the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chebysshop Tur∣pin, and sayd to them in thys wyse. barons sayd he I cannot maruayle me to moche of Lohier my eldest son that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ieth so longe in hys message I haue great feare that some incon∣tinent be happed vnto hym. I dre∣med this night in my slepe that the thonder bolte fell vpon my Sonne Lohier, and then came the Duke be∣nes of Aygremount vpon hym and smote his head of, but by my bearde yf he haue doone so: whyles he ly∣ueth he shall neuer accorde with me. Nor I shall neuer haue Ioye at my herte. For it is he that I loue best in this worlde. Syr sayd y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Nay∣mes I beleue not such thinges, nor vnto suche dremes ye shall not gyue no credence, alwayes sayde the king yf he haue doone so: I shall neuer le∣ue him the value of a peny, for I shall sende for the Normans, the Bernyge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, the Fleminges, the chā∣penoys, the Almaynes, the Bauiers and for Englishemen, and so shall I goe vpon hym and shall vtterly de∣stroy hym, and Naymes sayde euer vnto hym that he shoulde not fraye hym selfe of nothynge tyll that he knewe the certentye. And as they spake thus: there came rydīg a mes∣senger vpon a horse fauell sore sicke and werye, and also sore wounded vnto the death. He came vnto Pa∣rys afore the Palays where Kyng Charlemayne was at the wyndow∣es. And whan he sawe come the Messanger: he came downe lightlye from the Palays halle vnto the gate and with him Naymes of Bauyer and Ogyer the Dane. And whan the Messanger saw the kinge: he salued him fall soft as he that was ryght sorye and sore wounded, and that wyth payne myght speake, and said in this maner wyse. Great folye ye dyd, whan ye dyd sende my Lorde your sonne for to aske trybute and obeyssaunce of the Duke Benes of Aygremounte, the whiche trybute your sonne asked him shāfully, but the duke whiche is sore fel and cruel whan he heard speak my sayd lorde your sonne: he cōmaūded to a mayny of knightes y<SUP>t</SUP> were there y<SUP>t</SUP> he should betake &amp; y<SUP>t</SUP> he should neuer retourne agayn to you for to recoūt his messa¦ge nor what answere he had founde to y<SUP>e</SUP> which takīg: y<SUP>e</SUP> medle was great
<PB REF="12"/> and cruell, so that your dere sōne Lo¦hier was dead there. And the Duke Benes of Aygremount kylled hym and all your folke except me and .ix other that conduyte and bryng your sonne in a byere. And I my selfe am sore hurt as ye may se. And than the messāger could speake no more. But fell downe in a swoune of the greate greefe and sore that he felte bycause of hys woundes. And whan the kīg had heard these wordes: he fel down vpon the groūd for the great sorow that he tooke therof and wrange his handes, and pulled his beard. And tare all hys heres sayinge. Ha good lorde that made heauen and erth, ye haue brought me in great sorowe &amp; tourment Irrecouerable that neuer shall cease with me. So requyre I vnto you the death humbly. For ne¦uer more desyre I not to lyue. The good duke of Bauyre began to re∣comfort him, sayinge. For goddes loue syr tourment not your self, but haue good hert and hope in god and recomfort your folke. And thys wolde say the duke Naymes for thē that he saw weepe there for theyr kīs¦men and freendes that were dead w<SUP>t</SUP> Lohier. And doo (sayd he to y<SUP>e</SUP> kyng) let your sonne be worshypfully bu∣ryed at saynt Germayne of the medo¦wes. And than ye shall goe vpon the Duke Benes of Aygremount wyth all your noble power, and great pu∣yssaunce, and shall destroy hym and all hys landes at your pleasure.</P>
<P>Than the kinge Charlemayne re∣comforted him selfe, and well he knew that Naymes coūselled hym truly and lawfully. Than sayd the kyng, Barons make redy, and wee shall go agaynst my dere sonne Lo∣hier. And incontinent all the pryn∣ces and Barons made them selfe re∣dye for to doo the commaundement of the kinge. And whan they were gone two myle out of Parys: they met with the corps. And were there with the Kinge Naymes Ogyer. Sampson of bourgoyne, and many other great Lordes. Than sayd the kinge Charlemayne whan he sawe the body of his deere sonne Lohier: Alas how shamefully am I created? he descended from his horse a foote, &amp; tooke vp the cloth that was vpō the biere &amp; behelde his sonne Lohier. Than saw he the head y<SUP>t</SUP> was smyt∣tē of from the body and the face that was all to Hewen. Ha good Lorde sayd he, how well maye I be made now al quicke, well I ought for to hate y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Benes of Aygremoūte that thus hath murdered my sonne, he than kissed his childe al bloudiful often and said vnto him in this wise. Ha faire sonne ye were a talle man and a gentil knight. Now praye I the puyssant God of glorye that he take your soule this yf it be his plea∣sure into hys Realme of Paradyse. Great sorow made the kyng Char∣lemayne for the death of his sonne Lohier. But alwayes recomforted him the good Duke Naymes And thē Ogyer the Dane and Sampson of Bourgoyne tooke him vnder the armes of him and ledde him vnto saynt Germayne of the medowes. And there the bodye of Lohier was buried and enoynted with balme as it apperteyneth vnto all the sonnes
<PB N="vii" REF="12"/> of kinges. Thus was he put into hys graue God haue of hys Soule mercy.</P>
<P>WE shall bene heere to speake of the good king Charlemayne y<SUP>t</SUP> was moch sori of his sonne Lohier as ye haue heard, and shall tell you of the good Duke Aymon of Rey∣nawde, his sonne, and of his three bretherne that were at Parys. My children sayd Aymon, ye know how the Kynge Charlemayne is moche wrothe and not without a cause, by cause y<SUP>t</SUP> my brother your vnkle hath slaine Lohier his sonne. And I wote well that he shall go vpon him with all his puyssaunce, but verelye we shall not go wyth him. But rather shall we goe to Dordon, and yf the Kyng make warre agaynst hym we shall helpe him with all our power. So lyghted anon on horsebacke the good duke Aymon &amp; the foure knigh¦tes his children, and bayted no wher tyll they came to Laon &amp; from thēs they rode so longe tyll they came to Dordon. And whan the Lady sawe her Lorde and her foure children: she was right glad and went against them for to welcom them, and asked after tydinges, and yf Raynawde &amp; hys other childeren were made kni∣ghtes? Than the good duke answe∣red yea, and after she asked why they were departed fro the kinges court? And than he rehersed vnto her word by word, how hys brother the duke Benes had slayne Lohier the sonne of the Kinge Charlemayne. Wherof the good Lady Margery was won∣de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>full wrothe and sorye. For well she knew that this death of Lohier was the totalle dystruccion of the Duke Aymon her housbande of her self and of her childerne and of their lande. She heard Renawde her el∣dest Sonne that thretened Charle∣mayne the great Kynge, then sayd to hym the Ladye hys Mother. My Sonne Reynawde I pray thee vn∣derstande me alytle. Loue thy soue∣rayne and thy naturall Lorde, and dread him aboue all thinge, and bere him honour and reuerēce. And God shall rewarde thee for it, and ye my Lorde Aymon I am moche maruel∣led of you that are departed from Charlemayne without leaue of him y<SUP>e</SUP> hath doone to you so moche good and so great worship, and hath geuē to your sonnes so noble and so riche armes and hath made them knigh∣tes with his owne handes, more great honour he might not doo to you nor to your childrē. Lady said y<SUP>e</SUP> Duke we be thus departed frō King Charlemayne because that my bro∣ther hath slayne his sonne as I haue tolde you afore. A God sayd y<SUP>e</SUP> Lady that of the virgin was borne in beth¦lehem, howe hath that euyll thys day surmounted the good? For god∣des loue my Lorde sayde the Ladye medle not withall. For ye shall see this next sōmer that the kinge shall go vpon your brother, &amp; by my coun¦sell serue the kynge your rightwyse Lorde, nor fayle him for nothynge. For and ye doo otherwyse: ye shall be vntrew and false towarde your Souerayne and naturall Lorde.</P>
<P>Lady sayd the duke by god omnipo∣tente I wold leuer haue lost my cas∣tell
<PB REF="13"/> and the halfe of my lande, than that my brother should haue slayne Lohier. Now the wyl of god be do∣ne therin, and none other wyse.</P>
<P>TO speake of the good Duke Aymon of Dordō and of his wife the duchesse and of theyr sōnes: we shal heere leue, &amp; shall returne to speake of kynge Charlemayne that was come agayne to parys, makīg great sorowe for his sonne Lohier. There had you seene many a gowne torne &amp; broken, many a hande wron∣gen, and manye heares of the head pulled so that it was piti and won∣der for to se. Alas mi dere sonne said kyng Charlemayne, he y<SUP>t</SUP> hath slayne thee so cruelly loued me but lytle. I shall neuer be in quiete nor in reste till that I haue take vengeaunce of thy death. Syr sayd the duke Bauy¦ere haue mercy of your selfe. For it behoueth not so great a prince as ye be for to make so great sorow as ye doo. And in y<SUP>e</SUP> meane whyle came a messenger afore y<SUP>e</SUP> kynge, which she∣wed to him howe Aymon Duke of Dordon &amp; his foure sōnes were gon into their countrie, wherof the kyng was sore an angred and wrothe.</P>
<P>And sware god and saynt Denis y<SUP>e</SUP> afore he sholde dye: that Aymon and his chylderen sholde abye full sore for it &amp; that y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Benes of Aygre∣moūte sholde not kepe them therfro The dyner was redy &amp; they wasshed their handes and were set at dinner but wyt it that the kynge dyd eate but lytle, as he y<SUP>t</SUP> was in greate me∣lancolye, &amp; the fayre Salamon ser∣ued that day afore hym the cuppe, &amp; great people was there. After diner the Emperour Charlemayne did rea¦son with his barons and sayd to thē (lorde sayd he) y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Benes of Ay∣gremount hath doone to me greate outrage y<SUP>t</SUP> so shamefully hath slayne my sonne Lohier. But and it please God I shall go wreke it vpon hym this next somer and I shall destroye all his land, and yf I may take him I shall not leaue hym for the duke Aymon y<SUP>e</SUP> shamefullye is gone from mee, nor for his foure sonnes that I haue made knightes wherof I me repente sore, but that I shall make them to be hanged. Syr sayd than y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Naymes nowe heare what I shal say to you, your sōne is dead by great vnhap &amp; well in an euill hour was he put to death, for neuer death was so sore solde ne so dere bought as this shalbe. So sende nowe for your folke through all your londes, and than from hens toward Aygre∣mounte take your waye. And yf ye may take the Duke Benes, let the death of your sōne Lohier be to him ful dere soulde.</P>
<P>NAymes sayd the kynge ye be a good man, sage curtoyse &amp; valyaunt, euen thus shall I doo, for well wysely ye haue counselled me. Than gaue he leaue to many of hys barons and gentil men that were in his courte at that time &amp; tolde them that eche of them should go into his countrie for to make them self redy, and that they should come agayne to him the next sommer. So was it doone as y<SUP>e</SUP> kynge had commaunded And thus wente the barons and the gentil men from y<SUP>e</SUP> courte into theyr
<PB N="viii" REF="13"/> coūtrey, and by them were tydinges brought through all the landes vn∣to Rome, that kynge Charlemayne made a great assemble of men of ar∣mes, so that the renome therof flou∣ghe vnto the duke Benes of Aygre∣mountes court, which of that other parte dyd sende for his kynsmen and freendes, and in especiall for his bre¦thern Gerarde of Roussylon, and Dron of Nantuel, so that they were whā they came together well foure score thousand fyghtynge men and mo, and as fayre folke as euer were sene, whiche than sayde I beleue yf the kynge besyege the Castell: that the worse shall returne vnto hym. Than sayd the Duke Benes of Ay∣gremount to Gerarde of Roussilon. Brother sayd he be not dysmayed, for I hope to hurte the kyng so sore yf he come vpon vs: that he shal be wery of his bargayn, but let vs goe forth towarde Troy in chāpaygne and there wee shall fyght wyth the kynge vygorously. For well I wote that God shall helpe vs agaynst hī. This was at the begynnyng of the moneth of Maye, and Charlemayn was at Paris, that abode after hys men that should come, for to go with a great puyssaunce vpon the Duke Benes of Aygremount. And bode not longe that Rychard of Normā∣dy came to the kynge wyth .xxx. thou¦sande fyghtyng men. And of a no∣ther syde came to hym the Erle Guy that had wyth hym a ryght noble &amp; a great company of good men, and after hym came Salamon of Ber∣tayne and the Erle Huon. And of al sydes ye should haue sene come to the Kynge Charlemayne Poeteuīs Gascoyns, Normans, Flemynges, Bernyers, and Bourgoynes, and so many other great Lordes that it was great wonder for to see, which came all and Lodged themselfe in y<SUP>e</SUP> medowes of saynt Germayne.</P>
<P>THan whan the kyng Charle∣mayne knew that this folke was all arryued: he had of it greate Ioye, and incontynent made hys ba¦tayles to departe, for to goe to hys enterpryse, and made of Rychard of Normandy, of Valleran of Buyl∣lon, of Guydellon of bauyere, of yza¦car of Nemours, of Oger the bane. and of Escouf the sonne of Oedon wyth them .xl. thousande men hys forewarde. There should ye haue sē a ryght noble companye, and manye hardi men, they departed from nigh Parys. And put them self to y<SUP>e</SUP> way strayght to Aygremounte, and they (th{us} rydyng after many dayes Iur∣ney whiche I can not tel) came there streyght to Ogyer the Dane that was in the forewarde a messanger sore hastyly rydynge. That asked to whome was thys noble cōpany, and he answered to hym that they were kynge Charlemaynes folke. Than sayd syr the messanger that he wolde well speake wyth hym, than went Oger the Dane and shewed hym the kyng. And assone as the messanger saw hym: he made hym due reuerēce, and the kyng gaue hym agayne hys salute, and him demaunded what he was and fro whens he came? and y<SUP>e</SUP> messanger tolde hym that he was of Troye and y<SUP>t</SUP> vnto him he was sent
<PB REF="14"/> fro Aubery the lorde of Troye that was his liege man, whiche besought hym humbly for socoures. For the Duke Benes of Aygremount, &amp; his two bretherne Gerarde of Roussyl∣lon, and Dron of Nantuel and with theim an hundred thousande figh∣ting men had besyeged him within Troye. And that yf ye came not to helpe hī, he must yelde vp the towne, also the fayre towre that Iulius Ce∣sar dyd buylde there.</P>
<P>WHan Charlemayne the Em∣perour vnderstode that Troi was besyeged by the duke Benes &amp; his bretherne, he was full sory of it and he swore by Saynte Denys of Fraunce, that he should go there w<SUP>t</SUP> hys army, and that yf he might hold the duke of Aygremounte he should make hym dye a shamefull death, so called he the Duke Naymes of ba∣uyere, Goodebew of fryse, and the Duke Walleran and sayd to theym. Barons ye vnderstande what thys messāger sayth, let vs ryde hastelye towarde Troy or it be take, and they answered to hym ryght gladly that they wolde doo it so. So dyd they ryde a good pace tyll that they came nyghe Troye. And firste of all came the forewarde with the Oryflame. Of the whyche were gouernours Ogyer the Dane, Rycharde of Nor∣mandy, &amp; the duke Walleran, and w<SUP>c</SUP> them fourty thousand men. And the Messanger of Troy that conduyted them. And whan they were come so nyghe y<SUP>t</SUP> they sawe Troye afore thē: a messanger came to Gerard of rous¦syllon that was afore Troy, saying to hym that the kinge Charlemayne came vpon them for to socoure Au∣bery with a ryght great &amp; puissaunt companye. Than layde Gerarde to hys bretherne, that is to wyte Duke Benes of Aygremount, and y<SUP>e</SUP> Erle Dron of Nantuell that it were good that they should go agaynste kynge Charlemayne w<SUP>t</SUP> all theyr puissaūce and that eche of them should proue himself a good man. They did so as they had deuysed, and Gerarde of Roussillon was the first in the fore∣warde, and they rode so longe till y<SUP>t</SUP> the one partye saw the other. Than sayd Ogier the Dane to Richard of Normandy whan he sawe come Ge∣rarde of Roussillon se: sayd he howe Gerard of Roussyllon weneth for to fare foule with vs. But now let vs thynke for to defende vs wel, so mo∣che that the worshyp abyde to the Kyng Charlemayne and to vs. And than they let renne theyr horses fro one parte and fro the other, and Ge∣rarde of Roussyllon wente &amp; smote an Almayne wyth his speare so mo¦che, that he made it to entre through the body of hym. Whiche fell anon dead to the ground, and Gerard to∣oke his baner &amp; cryed with an high voyce Roussyllon Roussyllon.</P>
<P>THan began the batayle sore stronge fell and cruell. And whan Ogyer the dane saw thus his folke dye; he was wood and mad with it. So went he and smote a kni¦ght named Pouson by suche a wyse that he put his spere thorough the body of hym whiche fel downe dead afore him. And whan Gerarde had seen the same: he went and smote one of Ogyers men, so that all dead he
<PB N="ix" REF="14"/> cast him afore hym. And then he said ye haue this for your maysters sake Ogyer. Muche great and meruayl∣lous was the stoure and the batayle so fiers. For there should ye haue se∣ne so many of sheeldes perced and clouen, and so mani a habergeon bro¦ken, and salettes and helmes vnbo∣kled and sore beten, and so many mē lying vpon the other dead, that all the earth was couered with y<SUP>e</SUP> bloud of the dead men (and of theym that were hurt there) so y<SUP>e</SUP> it was a great pitie to for to see. And than came the duke Benes of Aygremounte that spurred hys horse terrtblie, and wēt and smote Enguerran lorde of Pe∣roune &amp; of saint Quintine so harde that he ouerthrew him dead afore hī and than sayd. Now go goddes cur¦se haue thou, and cryed with an hi∣ghe voyce Aygremounte, and than came to him his brother the Duke of Nantuell with all his folke, and they went al together vpon Charle∣maynes folke, and of the other part came with great puissaunce. Almay∣nes poeteuins and Lumbardes al∣so y<SUP>t</SUP> were of the parte of kinge Char¦lemayne. So medled theym selfe the one party amōge the other. And ther was moche harde and horryble assē∣ble. For there were slayne many mi∣ghty and worthy knightes of bothe sides, and Richarde of Normandye shewed wel there his great prowesse and worthines. For he wente and smote a knight y<SUP>t</SUP> Gerarde of Rous∣sillon loued moche by suche a stren∣gth that he ouerthrewe hym dead from his horse to the erth afore the sayd Gerarde. Whiche than sayd.</P>
<P>Now am I wel sory and wrothe for hym that now is dead that I loued so sore, certes I shal neuer haue Ioy at my hert but y<SUP>t</SUP> I be auenged ther∣of shortlye. Than tooke Gerarde of Roussillon his baner in his fist. But hys brother Nantuell came anon to hym and sayd, brother I coūsell you that ye tourne agayne. For here co∣meth Charlemayne wyth hys folk, and well I tell you that yf wee a∣byde hym: the losse shall tourne vp∣pon vs. And whyle they were spea∣kynge thus: Walleran of Bollon smote y<SUP>e</SUP> neuew of Gerarde of Rous∣sillon so that he foyned at hym, with his swerde through the body of hym &amp; fell downe dead to y<SUP>e</SUP> earth. Than trowed Gerarde to haue gone out of his wytte, and sente anon for the duke Benes his brother y<SUP>t</SUP> he should come soone to succoure him, and he dyd so as pren and valyaunt that he was. And of the other syde assem∣bled there the kynge and hys folke.</P>
<P>¶ So shal you now hear of a thing meruaylous of so greate a nobles y<SUP>e</SUP> at the same feeld were cruelly slayn. This was in the moneth of Maye vpon a mornynge that kyng Char∣lemayne did assemble his folke with the folke of the duke of Aygremoūte and of his bretherne. To the whych assemble ye should haue sene manye fayre harnayses shynynge for the Sunne that fayre and cleare was y<SUP>e</SUP> day, the whyche assemble was wun¦derfull stronge. For there were so many feete and heades smytten of &amp; so many good horses slayne, and the other ranne thorough the medowes wherof the maysters lay dead vpon
<PB REF="15"/> the grasse. And wyt it for trouthe y<SUP>t</SUP> there were dead that same day of the one syde and of the other: more than xl. thousand men. A God what slau∣ghter, there was muche great nobles dead. The duke Benes sore angred went and smote syr Walter Lorde of Pierrele in his shielde so y<SUP>t</SUP> hys spere went through the body of hym and fell downe dead afore hym. Than cryed he with an hye voyce his baner Aygremounte.</P>
<P>GReat was the preas, and y<SUP>e</SUP> ba∣tayle fyers and meruaylous. And there shewed Rychard of Nor∣mandy much worthili his great har∣dynes. For he Iusted agaynst y<SUP>e</SUP> duke of Aygremoūt so that he perced hys sheelde and dyd hurt hym right sore and sayd to him by God ye shall not thys daye escape death. It was an euyll daye for you whan ye dyd slea my Lorde Lohier, &amp; with that he did draw out his swerde, and smote the duke agayne vpō his helme in such a wise that if it had not ben a coyfe of steele that made his stroke to slide the said Benes had be dead y<SUP>e</SUP> houre And the stroke fell downe vpon the horse, &amp; cut y<SUP>e</SUP> horse in two as though it had be nothing. And thus fell the horse dead vnder hys mayster. Thā was y<SUP>e</SUP> Duke Benes sore abasshed whan he thus foūd him self a groūd But he stoode vpon his feete redely as he that was preu and valyaunte holdyng his swerde in his hande, &amp; went and smote a knight named sir Symon so that he kylled hym sterke dead in the place. And than he called wyth an highe voyce. Aygremount his baner. Than came to hym hys two bretherne, the Duke of Roussil∣lon and of Nantuell, and of the side of kinge Charlemayne came Ogyer Naymes, Wallerā of Bollon, Huō lorde of Mauns the Erle Salamon Leon of Frise the archebisshop Tur¦pyn and Escoufe the sonne of Oedō And than should ye haue sene there at that assemble muche great &amp; mer∣uayllous noblesse of knyghtes that lay dead vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> erth, the one vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> other that it was a pyteous syght for to beholde.</P>
<P>TO this inhumayne occysion was come thēperour Char∣lemayne cryinge barons if they esca¦pe vs we shall neuer haue honoure, and than he bare vp his spere to the rest and went and smote into the she∣elde of Gerarde of Roussyllon so y<SUP>t</SUP> he ouerthrew both horse and man to the ground, and there had be his last daye yf it had not ben the Duke Be∣nes and Dron his brethern, y<SUP>t</SUP> muche worthely and wyth great dylygēce succoured hym. Of that other party came Ogyer the Dane vpon hys good horse Broyforte that smote a knyght of the folke of Gerard duke of Roussyllon called Syr Foulquer so that he cloue him to the teeth and fell downe dead vnto the erth. And whan Gerarde of Roussyllon sawe thus hys knyght slayne he called to god &amp; to our lady saying. Well haue I thys daye lost my fayre and good knight. And the duke of Aygremoūt was sore abasshed and prayed God also full pyteously y<SUP>t</SUP> it wolde please hym to kepe hym from death, and
<PB N="x" REF="15"/> from fallynge in to the handes of Charlemayne. Nyghe was the son∣ne vnder and it was well aboute cō¦plyn tyme &amp; the fyghters of the one parte &amp; of the other were voery &amp; sore chauffed, And so wythdrewe the thre bretherne abacke vnto theyr Tentes with moche wrathe, and in especyal Gerarde of Roussyllon that had lost that day Aymanoy his cosyn and a hundred other of the best Knyghtes of his company. And he sayd in this wyse. An euyll houre it was whan the sonne of Charlemain was slain. Than came to hym the duke Benes of Aygremoūt bledyng as he y<SUP>t</SUP> was horriblie wounded. And whan Ge∣rarde saw hym: he began to sygh tē∣derly sayinge. Fayre brother are ye woūded to death? Nay sayd he I shal soone be whole. Than swore Ge∣rarde the duke of Roussyllon that to morow at y<SUP>e</SUP> sonne rising: He should begyn agayn y<SUP>e</SUP> batayle against king Charlemayne and hys folke wher∣fore thyrty thousande shal lose their lyues. Alas for god nay sayd his bro¦ther the Duke Nantuell. But yf ye wyll doo my counsell we shall sende xxx. of the wysest knightes that wee haue vnto kynge Charlemayne, and by our sayd knyghtes we shall doo hym to wyt and shew hūbli y<SUP>t</SUP> he haue pitie and mercy of vs, and that the Duke Benes our brother shall a∣mende hym the death of hys sonne Lohier euen so as it shalbe aduysed by the prynces &amp; barons of hys fe∣lawshyp and of ours, &amp; ye know wel all redy y<SUP>t</SUP> we ben hys lyege men, &amp; y<SUP>t</SUP> for to warre agaynst hym we doo cruel falshed, &amp; yet more it is, that yf he had loste all his folke that he hath here with him, or euer y<SUP>t</SUP> it were a mo¦neth passed he should haue recouered twyse as many, so may we nothing doo agaynst hym. And therfore may we nothyng doo against him, &amp; ther∣fore I pray you my brethern, that ye wyll doo thus, &amp; to hym answered his two bretherne that they wolde doo it, syn that he counselled thē so, and cōcluded together y<SUP>t</SUP> they should sende thyther as soone as it were day. They made that nyght good watche vnto the morning, and than they made redi their messangers for to sende to the kyng Charlemayne, And whan they were redy: Gerarde of Roussyllon sayd to them. Lordes say wel to kynge Charlemayne that we be sore dyspleased of the death of hys sonne Lohier. and y<SUP>t</SUP> our brother the duke Benes repenteth him selfe of it full sore, &amp; that yf it please hym to haue mercy of vs that we shal go &amp; serue hym where it shal please him to sende vs wyth .x. thousand fygh∣tynge men. And also ye shall saye to Naymes of Bauyere that we pray hym y<SUP>t</SUP> he wyll enploy hymselfe to∣warde the kyng Charlemayne that this accorde may be had.</P>
<P>AFter that the messāgers had well all alonge vnderstand what they should saye to the Kynge Charlemaine from y<SUP>e</SUP> three brethern dukes: They lyghted on horsbacke eche of them, berynge braunches of Olyue tree in their handes, in token of peace. And ceased not to ryde tyll that they were come afore y<SUP>e</SUP> tente of the kinge charlemayne. Than spake
<PB REF="16"/> one of them whiche was named ste∣uen, that salued the king in this ma∣ner. Syr I praye our lorde that of his grace giue you good lyfe &amp; long. And wyt syr that the duke Gerarde of Roussyllon and the Duke Benes of Aygremount and Dron of Nan∣tuell ben come hither the whiche cry you mercye, and beseche you ryght humbly that it please you to pardon them the death of your sonne Lohi∣er. Of the whiche they are wrothe &amp; sory. And y<SUP>e</SUP> duke of Aygremount let you wyte by vs, that yf it be your pleasure to doo so: that he and hys bretherne shalbe your lyege men, &amp; shall come to serue you with .x. thou sand fyghting men in all that shalbe your pleasur to enploy them, syr for goddes sake haue remembraūce that god forgaue his death to Longes y<SUP>e</SUP> cruelly sticked him to the hart. wher¦fore syr please it you to pardon thē, &amp; take them to your good grace. And of this right hūbly they beseche you.</P>
<P>WHan the kynge Charlemayne had thus heard speake y<SUP>e</SUP> mes∣sangers of the three brethern: He frō peled his forehead, &amp; knitted his bro¦wes, and looked full angrely, and at that houre he answered to them no∣thynge, and than soone after he begā to speake in this maner. Bi my fai∣th syr Steuen sayde he well had the duke Benes lost his wittes whan he so shamfully slew my deere sonne Lohier, whiche I loued so tenderly. Now is he my man wyll he or not. Syr sayd Steuē I am certayne that he shall doo to you all reason to the direction of your good counsell.</P>
<P>Than sayd the kinge of this we shal counseyll vs, and withdrewe hym a lytle a side, and called to him duke Naymes. Ogyer the Dane, syr Sa∣lamon. Huon of Mauns. Walleran of Bollon. Odet of Langres, and Leon of Fryse, &amp; sayd to them. Lor∣des heere ben the messangers of the duke Benes and of his bretherne y<SUP>t</SUP> sende me worde y<SUP>t</SUP> they wyll come for to serue me where my wyl shalbe wyth .x. thousand good fyghting mē yf we wyll pardon theym the death of my sonne Lohyer. And they shall be our vassayle and true liege men, &amp; of vs they shall holde theyr landes and theyr lordeships. Syr answered the duke Naimes in this is nothing but well. So counsell I you that ye pardon them. For they be muche valyaunte, and of great renome.</P>
<P>Wherfore pardon them yf it please you.</P>
<P>THan by the Counsell of the Duke Naymys of Bauyere the kynge dyd pardon the three bre∣therne &amp; called to him the .iii. knigh∣tes, and said to them, how he pardo∣ned the three dukes the death of his sonne Lohier, by suche a condicion that the duke Benes of Aygremoūt should come for to serue hym at the feast of Saynt Iohn next comynge wyth .x. thousand fyghtyng men wel arayed, and ye shall tel to them that they surely come nowe to me for to take of theym theyr othe and fayth that they shall fro hens forthe, obey and serue truly. And that of me they shall holde all theyr landes. Then departed the knyghtes from afore
<PB N="xi" REF="16"/> the kyng Charlemayne and came a∣gayne vnto the Dukes and shewed vnto them how they had sped of their message with the king Charlemayn wherof the three brethern thanked much humbly our lorde God. Then sayd the duke Rycharde of Roussyllō it is reason that we take of our good gownes and go to the kynge Char∣lemayne naked and crye hym mercy of this that we haue thus offended agaynst his hygh puyssaunce &amp; lorde shyp, and the other two brethern an¦swered that well they ought to doo so. So tooke y<SUP>e</SUP> noble knyghtes their clothes of, and al naked bare foote and in poore estate departed from theyr lodges, and well foure thou∣sande knightes wyth them all bare fote and in their shertes, and in such estate as were theyr maysters. In thys wyse they came tofore the king Charlemayne. And wyt wel that in right great humilitie were set the three bretherne for to haue peace and accorde wyth the kyng Charlemain that was wroth to them specyally to the Duke of Aygremount as more playnlye ye shall heare here after.</P>
<P>WHan the kynge Charlemayn sawe thus come y<SUP>e</SUP> three bre∣therne wyth theyr barons &amp; knygh∣tes: he called to hym the duke Nay∣mes &amp; many other barons, and sayd to thē, can ye not tell me what folke ye see yonder comyng? Syr sayd the dukes Naymes it is the Duke Be∣nes of Aygremount with his folke, that come for to requyre you of mer∣cie. (This hanging) y<SUP>e</SUP> Duke Benes of Aygremount came afore the king and cast hymselfe vpon hys knee, &amp; sayd vnto hym in this wise. Syr for god I crye God mercy we ben heere comen by your commaundement, if I haue slayne your deere Sonne by my foly: I now as your man yelde me &amp; my bretherne also Gerarde of Roussyllon and Dron of Nantuell and wyl be your lyege men and serue you with all our puyssaunce where your plesure shalbe to set vnto, and neuer dayes of our lyues we shall fayle you but yf it belonge in you.</P>
<P>Than whan the kynge sawe theym thus come humblie towarde hys presence in theyr shertes &amp; barefoote and had hearde this that the Duke of Aygremount had sayd to hym: he had of them ryght great pitie, &amp; par∣doned them the death of his Sonne Lohier and all his euyll wyll. Than should ye haue sene from one part &amp; from the other kysse and colle eche o∣ther their kynnesmen, and som wept for Ioye and the other for pitie.</P>
<P>WHan were peased y<SUP>e</SUP> barōs w<SUP>t</SUP> the king Charlemayne by the counsel of the good duke Raymos: than sware &amp; promi∣sed the three brethern good fydelitie to the kynge Charlemayne, and that they should serue him at all tymes y<SUP>t</SUP> he should cal for thē. So tooke they a glad leue from the kynge, but the kynge charged the Duke of Aygre∣mount that she should come to serue hym at the feast of saynt Iohn next comynge. And than returned kynge Charlemayne towarde Parys, &amp; the bretherne went agayne ryght gladde eche of theym towarde hys place, for well they trowed for
<PB REF="17"/> to haue accorde the Duke Benes of Aygremount theyr brother towarde Charlemayne, but otherwyse it wēt &amp; full lytle was worthe theyr accord for soone after dyed therof the Duke Benes of Aygremount by treason and vnder the saufe conduyte of the kyng Charlemayne, as ye shall vn∣derstande yf ye wyll heare me. ¶ Ye shall wyt that a lytle afore the feast of saynt Iohn baptyst that the kyng Charlemayne helde a greate courte in Parys and the Duke Benes for∣gat not to goe thyther as he had pro¦mised, so departed he fro Aygremoū∣te wyth two hundred knightes and tooke his way to Parys towarde y<SUP>e</SUP> kyng for to serue hī where he wolde put hym vnto. Now shall ye heare how the kynge beyng in parys, came towarde hym the earle Guenes his neuewe. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry foulquet of Moryllō Hardres &amp; Berenger, which told hī how y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Benes cam for to serue him w<SUP>t</SUP> two hundred knightes, sayīg by this maner. Syr how may ye lo∣ue or well be serued of him that so cruelly hath slayne your sonne oure cosin, if your plesure were we should well auēge you of hym. For in good soth we should slea hym. Guen{is} said the king it were treason, for we haue gyuen to hym trewes, alwayes doo with it your wyll, so that the synne tourne not vpon me, &amp; kepe you. for in certayne the duke of Aygremoūt is ryght mighty &amp; of great kynred, &amp; well ye myght happe to haue a doo yf ye fulfil in this your owne entēt. Syr answered Guenes care ye not therfore, for therin is so ryche a man in all the worlde y<SUP>e</SUP> durst vndertake any thynge agaynst me &amp; my linage. Syr sayd Guenelon to morowe erly we shall departe with foure thou∣sand fyghting mē, &amp; take no care for it. For we shall delyuer this worlde of hym. Certes sayd the king it were treason. care not therfore sayd Gue∣nes he slew well your sonne Lohyer by treason whyche was my kynsmā and therfore I wyll be auenged and I can. Now doo you there in sayde the kynge protestynge alwayes that I am not therto consentyng.</P>
<P>WHan the mornynge came: de∣parted well erly fro Parys the sayd Guenelon and his felawes and wyth them well foure thousād fyghtynge men, and neuer they tari∣ed tyll that they came in the valey of Soyssons, and there thei recountred the Duke Benes w<SUP>t</SUP> hys puyssaunce and whan the Duke Benes sawe them come: he sayd to his folke. lor∣des I trow that yonder be some fol∣ke of the kynges that retourne again from the courte. It is no force sayd one of his knightes. I wote not what it may be said the duke. For the king Charlemayne is sore vengeable for to auenge hym self, and also he hath with hym a lynage of folke the whi∣che be fell and cruell. It is Guenes Foulquet of Moryllon and certayne other of his courte, and in trouth to night in my sleape I dreamed that a Gryffon came out of the Hea∣uens that perced my sheelde and all myne armes, so that hys nayles stacke into my Lyuer and my myl∣te, and all my men were therof in great tourmēt, &amp; they all were eaten
<PB N="xii" REF="17"/> wyth bores and of Lions, and none of them scaped, but one alone. And also me semed that out of my mouth yssued a whyte Doue. Than sayde one of hys knightes that it was all but well, &amp; that for cause of thys dre∣me he ought not to dismay hymself. I wote not sayde the duke what god shall sende me, but of thys my herte dredeth. So cōmaūded the duke Be¦nes that euery man should arme hī selfe, &amp; hys knyghtes answered that ryght gladly they wolde so doo. So began eueryche of them to seeke his armes and habylymēres. Here shal you heare of the harde hewynge and of a thynge heuy to be recounted of the great slaughter that made y<SUP>e</SUP> tray tour Guenellon of the good Duke Benes of Aygremount.</P>
<P>THe Erle Guenes rode wyth great force that was wonder∣full stronge and fyers &amp; well accompanyed. Than went and met with the Duke Benes fyrste Foul∣quet of Moryllon the whiche sayde to him that he had doone il for to slea Lohyer y<SUP>e</SUP> eldest sonne of king Char∣lemayne, but or euer the euyn cam: he should haue a sory rewarde for it. Whan the duke vnderstode hym: he meruayled hym selfe muche and said Ha god howe myght one kepe hym from traytours. Alas I helde the king Charlemayne for a true prince &amp; I se now the contrary but a fore y<SUP>t</SUP> I dye I shall sell my death ful dere. Than went they &amp; fought y<SUP>e</SUP> one par¦ty agaynst the other muche angry in so muche y<SUP>t</SUP> Guenes smote by force the duke his cosyn Reyner so that he ouerthrew hym downe dead to the erthe afore his fete and after he cried with an hye voyce, smite on knygh∣tes for he slew my good cosin Lohier the duke Benes of Aygremoūt day∣ned not accorde with me, but nowe I shall sell it him ful deare. So ran¦guenes &amp; his folke vpon the duke of Aygremount, and the Duke ryght worthyly defended himself &amp; smote a knyght named syr Fawcon so that he shoued his swerde into the bodye of hym, and he fell dead afore hym. And after thys the Duke Benes of Aygremount tooke himselfe for to weepe strongly, &amp; wisshed much af∣ter his two brethern &amp; also after his neuewes. Alas sayd he deere Sonne Mawgys where be you now that ye be not here for well I wote yf ye wyste this enterpryse ye should well succour me. Ha my deere brother y<SUP>e</SUP> duke of dordon &amp; of nātuel &amp; Gerard of roussyllon wel I know y<SUP>e</SUP> ye shall neuer se me a lyue. Alas y<SUP>t</SUP> ye knowe not y<SUP>e</SUP> false enterprise of charlemayn &amp; of y<SUP>e</SUP> erle Guenellon, y<SUP>t</SUP> so cruelly &amp; by great treason shal this dai make me in humainli for to dye, wel I wot that right worthely ye should come helpe me. Ha my deere neuewes rey∣nawde, Alarde Rychard &amp; Guichard so much nede I haue this day of you. Ha my deere neuew Reynawde wor¦thy knight, as y<SUP>u</SUP> art, yf it please vn∣to god of hys benigne grace, that thou might know the greuous tur∣ment and the sorowfull matter vn∣to the whiche by treason I am thys day lyuered. Wel I wot that by thee I should haue succours. For in al y<SUP>e</SUP> worlde is not thy peere of beautie of goodnes of prowesse &amp; of worthynes
<PB REF="18"/> Now may not this day succoure me al my noble and worthy linage, but that cruelly and vnder the saufcon∣duyte of Charlemayne I shall dye pyteously.</P>
<P>HYers was the bataile &amp; right harde to endure, but well ye may wyt y<SUP>t</SUP> the duke of Aygremoūt myght not resyste agaynst so manye folke. For he had not with him but two hundred knyghtes, and the o∣ther were more than foure thousand thus were they euyll matched. Thā should ye haue sene that dai so moch braynes in the feelde, so manye feete and heades smyten of, that it was a pytious thyng to behold. After cam yet agayne Guenes that smote Ioy∣usselyne of Bloy so that he casted hī dead to the erth, and he made soone to goe backe the Duke Benes folke of Aygremounte. Than was sore a basshed the duke of Aygremoūt, the whyche knewe well that wythoute death he myght not escape. So went he and smote one of Guenes folke so great a stroke that he ouerthrew him dead. For none other wyse he coulde doo, but defende hym selfe as well as he could for to length his lyfe wythall. Ha god what a greate dommage it was to haue thus sham¦fully betrayed hym. For after many chyrches many townes and Castel∣les were therfore set in a fyre, and so many great nobles full pyteouslye brought to death. So much sped the traytour Guenes agaynst the good duke of Aygremount that the folke of the duke were weke &amp; almost gō. For of two hūdred y<SUP>t</SUP> he had brought he had no moe with hym, but fourty Barons: sayd y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Benes of ay∣gremount ye se that we ben almoste all dead yf we defende vs not wyth great herte and worthynes. And for goddes loue let euery of vs be wor∣the three as longe as we shall now be alyue. For ye se that here pyteou∣sly we must departe &amp; breake felow∣shyp. Than wente the duke agayne &amp; smote a knight named syr Helye, so that he made hym to fall dead to the erth. And than cryed with an hyghe voyce Smyte well barons. The va∣ley was fayre and soūded of y<SUP>e</SUP> noyse that was made there, &amp; at that hour one named Gryffon of Hautefell, wente &amp; smote the dukes horse into the breste wyth hys spere so that he ouerthrew him vnder the horse, and the duke anon arose vpon his feete, &amp; tooke his swerde wenyng to smite the sayd Gryffon, but the stroke fell vpon the horse so that he cutte him a sonder as it had ben nothynge.</P>
<P>WHan the duke of Aygremoūt saw himselfe thus on foote he knew wel that it was doone of him but well he sware that hys death he should sell ryght dere, but sodaynly came there vpon him the erle Gue∣nes that sat vpon a good courser y<SUP>e</SUP> which smote the duke Benes of Ay∣gremounte with his speare suche a stroke, that he shoued hym through &amp; through his body, &amp; thus fell downe dead the duke Benes of Aygremoūt and than y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Griffon y<SUP>e</SUP> father of the sayd Guenes came to the Duke Benes of Aygremoūt that lay dead vpon the sande &amp; shoued his swerde
<PB N="xiii" REF="18"/> in to his foundement. Than sayd y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Gryffon, no whast thou thy re¦warde for mi lorde Lohiers death y<SUP>t</SUP> thou let slew shamefullye w<SUP>t</SUP> in thy palays. Now is the good and wor∣thy duke Benes of Aygremount de¦ceassed, god of his soule haue mercy, &amp; the treatour Genellon &amp; the Lord of Hautefell y<SUP>t</SUP> lighted vpon a good horse wente after the duke of Aigre¦mountes folke y<SUP>t</SUP> fled, whiche were but .x. a lyue of two hundred and yet these .x. were soone ouertaken, and than the traytours made theym to swere and promyt that the bodye of y<SUP>e</SUP> late duke theyr mayster they shold beare to Aygremount, lyke y<SUP>e</SUP> he had doo bryng the body of Lohier to pa∣ris in a byere, and the sayd knightes promysed them for to doo so. So to∣ke they the corps from the other bo∣dyes dead, wherof was there greate number, &amp; put hym in a byere. And than went on theyr way with all &amp; whan they were gon a lytle fercher: God knoweth what sorowe and la∣mentacion that they made for the death of theyr mayster, sayinge. Ha god good duke that so worthy was how now we are sory for y<SUP>e</SUP>, certayn∣ly full euyll hath doone kyng Char∣lemayne that vnder this saufcōduy∣te hath made thee to be slayne in trea¦son. These sorowful knightes went thus makynge theyr mone bearyng the body of the Duke Benes theyr mayster vpon a byere that two hor∣ses bare, whiche corps neuer staun∣ched of bledyng by the spare of .viii. myles, &amp; how many dayes Iourney that these knightes were w<SUP>t</SUP> y<SUP>e</SUP> bodye of theyr mayster by y<SUP>e</SUP> way: I cannot tel you. But they went so longe that they came nygh Agygremount, and approched so moche that the tydyn∣ges came to y<SUP>e</SUP> towne &amp; to y<SUP>e</SUP> duchesse y<SUP>t</SUP> her lorde had be thus traytoruslye slayne. So ought not be asked of the greate sororow y<SUP>t</SUP> the duchesse &amp; her sonne Mawgis made. They yssued after out of the towne with them of the church &amp; went agaynst the corps. Nor also ought not to be asked yf there were made that day great we∣pynges &amp; lamentacions. For whan the duchesse saw her lorde, &amp; the woū∣des y<SUP>t</SUP> he had in his body more than three times: she fell downe in a swo∣ne vpon him. And in this wyse they bare the corps to the chief churche &amp; the bisshop of the towne dyd the ser∣uyse. And thā he was put in his gra∣ue &amp; was right reuerently buryed. Thā sayd his sonne mawgis. Good lorde what a domage is this of such a worthy lorde to haue be thus slayn cruelly by treason, but &amp; if I liue lōg Charlemayne and the traytours y<SUP>t</SUP> thus haue doone: shal abye for it ful deerely. His lady mother he recom∣forted and said to her. My deere mo¦ther haue a litle patience. For myne vnkles Gerarde of Roussyllon Drō of nantuel, and my cosyns Reynaw∣de Alarde, Guicharde and Rycharde shall helpe me wel for to auenge the death of my lorde my father.

<P>YE shal mow heare and vnder∣stand from hensforthon a terry∣ble and a piteous songe, yf ye thereafter lyst to herken. Thys was at the feaste of Penthecoste after the holy thursdaye, that the king Charle∣mayne helde a great court at Parys, after that he hadde accorded with the bretherne of the saide duke Benes of Aygremoūt. And to y<SUP>e</SUP> said feast came William the Englyshe, Walleran of Bullon .xv. kinges, &amp; .xxx. dukes, and well .lx. erles were there at y<SUP>t</SUP> daye for to crown Charlemain. And also was come there the duke Aymon, of Dor∣don with his foure sonnes, that is to wit Reinawd, Alard, Richard, &amp; Gui∣chard, to the which Aimon: the kynge said. Aimō said he I loue you &amp; your children wel. and wyt that I voyl ma∣ke of the fayre Reinawd my stuard, &amp; the other shall serue me for to beare my faucons &amp; goe with me. Syr said the good Aymon I thank you muche of the greate worshyp that ye doo to me &amp; to my children. And wyt that thei shal serue you truly as your lieg mē, but wel I tol you good king that ye mysprised sore whan my brother the duke Benes of Aygremount vn∣der your saufconduit, &amp; in treason ye made thus shamefullye die, &amp; beleue that it greueth me ful sore at the hert &amp; if we doubted not you so much, cer∣tes vengeaunce we should take ther∣of. But sith that my brother Gerard hath pardoned it to you: I forgeue it you also. Aimō said y<SUP>e</SUP> king ye know better than that ye saye. For ye know wel the offence that your brother had doon to me for to haue slaine so crue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ly. Loihere my eldest sonne y<SUP>t</SUP> I loued so much. Now set the one ayenst the other. &amp; let be spoken nomore therof. No more we shal saide duke Aimon, but wel I pray god to haue mercye of his soule, for he was a right wor∣thy knight. Thē came forth Reinaw¦de, Alard, Guychard, and Richarde, which reasoned with the kinge, say∣ing in this maner. Sir said Reinaw∣de the fairest of al knights and moste expert in faites of knighthode, ye ha∣ue made me &amp; my brethern that been now afore you knightes, but wit it for very certain that we loue you not &amp; that we haue toward you a greate and a mortall hate for the deathe of our vncle the duke Benes of Aygre∣mount, of the whiche deathe ye haue not accorded with vs. Whan the king vnderstoode Reinawde: he looked
<PB REF="20"/> grymly and fyerssly in his visage for greate wrath and became blacke as a cole, and smote his forhed for angre and after said, Reinawd thou yong boye voide out of my presence. For I swere by saynt Simon, and if it were not the companye of the barons that be heere: I should make thee to be put in suche pryson that thou shouldest not see nother hande nor foote that thou haste. Syr said Reinawd it wer not reason. But sith that it is so ferre come that ye will not heere vs: we shall keep our peace.</P>
<P>THus lefte the foure sonnes of Aimon the debate and spake no more to the kyng Charlemayn for that tyme of this matter. Fayre was the courte, and the day was ful fayre and bryghte, and fayre was y<SUP>e</SUP> companye as of .xv. kinges .xxx. du∣kes, and .lx. erles. They went to the chirch for to heare y<SUP>e</SUP> faire masse that was songe, and muche rych was the offeryng. And whan they had hearde the masse: they came agayn to the pa∣lays, and asked after water for to washe theyr handes, and the dyner was readye, so they washed and set theym downe to dyner. And the .xv. kynges were all set, except the king Salamon that serued that daye with the Duke Godfraye. But Reynaw∣de at thys dynner myght not eat by cause that the kynge Charlemayne had rebuked hym so shamefully. Ha saide Reynawde to hymselfe Alas, howe shall I conne doo so muche that I may auenge my selfe of Char¦lemayne for the death of my vncle, y<SUP>t</SUP> so much was beloued, whiche traito∣rusly and shamefully hath be slain? &amp; if I take not vengeaunce of it. I shal wexe mad. In this wise sorowed the good Reinawd, and his brethern re∣comforted him. The barōs came out after diner for to play &amp; sporte theym selfe, and Berthelot the neuewe of Charlemayn called Reynawd for to play with him, wherof grew a great mischeef for afterward many a good knight died therfore &amp; manye a fayre childe fatherles as here after ye shal herken well.</P>
<P>NOwe was set Berthelot and the worthy Reynawde for to playe at the ches whiche were of y∣uory, wherof the boord was of golde massy, and so longe they played that debate fel betwene them two, by such maner that berthelot called Reinaw∣de horsonne, and tooke vp his hand, and smote Reynawde in the vysage so that the bloud fell to the grounde, and whan Reynawde sawe himself thus shamefully outeraged: he was ryght wroth and sore angred &amp; sware by god him should yl betyde therfore. Thā tooke Reinawd the ches boord and smote Berthelot vpon his head so harde that he cloued hym to the teeth, and thus Berthelot fell down deade to the grounde afore hym, so be¦gan the crye at that houre sore strong in the Palays that Reynawde y<SUP>e</SUP> son∣ne of Aimon had slain Berthelot the neuewe of kyng Charlemayn. Whan the kynge vnderstoode thys: he went nyghe oute of his wyt, and cal∣led of heyghte. Barons keep well that Reinawd scape not. For by saint
<PB N="xv" REF="20"/> Denis of Fraunce: he shall not esca∣pe quicke yf we maye holde hym, for he hath slaine our neuew Berthelor. Than ran soone the knightes vpon Reinawde. And his kynnesmen defended him nobly. And thus was there greate stryfe and manye heres pulled, and many gownes toren. For suche a fray was there neuer seen as that daye was in the palays of Pa∣rys. Many strokes gaue there Maw¦gys the cosin of Reinawd, and sonne to the duke Benes of Aygremount. And while that this fraye was in the palays: Reinawde and his three bretherne, and theyr cosyn Mawgys escaped redyly out of the palays and came vnto theyr horses that soone were made redye. So lyghted they on horsebacke and tode soone oute of Parys, and fled streight vnto Dordō towarde theyr lady mother.</P>
<P>ANd whan themperour Char∣lemaine wyst that Reinawd and his bretherne were gone oute of Parys: he made for to be redy wel two thousand knightes for to folow them. Now keep them our lorde that on the crosse suffred passyon. For yf the kynge holde them: they shall dye withoute remyssyon, but Reinawde vpon hym is no care. For he was vpon his horse bayard that goeth as the wynde. So taryed not the foure brethern &amp; theyr cosyn tyll that they came vnto Sawmore, and they bay∣red theyr horses of Alarde, Richard and of Guycharde. Thanne began Reynawde to make sorowe sayinge. Fayre god that suffred deathe and passyon, keep thys daye my brethern and my cosyn from the deathe, and from combraunce, and from fallinge in the handes of Charlemayne the cruell, and of the other parte chased them the frenchemen brochyng with the spurres as fast as theyr horses myght renne, so muche that a knight that was better horsed then the other were: ouertooke Reynawde and sayd to hym, ye shall abyde ye vntrue knyghte and I shall brynge you to kinge Charlemayne. And whan Reinawde heard hym: he turned bay∣arde ayenst hym and smot the knyght with his spere in his sheeld, &amp; rought him with so great a might that ste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke deade he ouerthrewe him. So seased Reinawde the knyghtes horse and tooke him to his brother Alarde that lyghted anon vpon the backe of him. And after that he was on this good horse: he went &amp; smote a nother kny∣ght with his swerd so that he made him fall deade afore him, and so be∣tooke this knightes horse to his bro∣ther Guicharde that thanked hym muche for it. And a nother knighte of the kynge Charlemayne came to theym. Glotons sayd the knighte ye shall come to the king that shal ma∣ke you al for to be hanged. Ha by my fayth said Reynawd thou shalt lye, and with this Reinawd tooke vp his swerd &amp; gaue him suche a stroke that he ouerthrew him dead at the groūd, than tooke Reinawd the horse by the reyne and gaue hym to his brother Rycharde that great need had of it. Now be the three brethern new hor∣sed &amp; Reinawd is vpon bayarde and his cosin Mawgis that he loued so
<PB REF="21"/> wel behynde him, now they goe god wyll leade them &amp; keep them from e∣uyll, &amp; Charlemayne pursued after them, but for nought he trauayled, for they were neuer the rather taken for hym. Than was the sonne gone vnder, and the nyght began to come, and the foure brethern &amp; their cosyn were come into the towne of Soissō.</P>
<P>SO much rode Reynawd by nyght and by daye vpon bayarde that bare him and Mawgis his cosyn: that they came to Dordon there they met with the duchesse theyr mother, that ranne for to kysse them and colle them. And syn asked what they had doon of theyr father and if they were departed from the courte with wra∣the? Lady sayd Reinawd, for I haue slayne Berthelot the neuewe of the kynge Charlemayn, the reason why I dyd so: was because he called me horeson &amp; gaue me with his fyst vp∣on my vissage so that the bloud came out of it. And whan the ladye vnder∣stoode him: she felle downe all in a swoune, and Reynawd tooke her vp redely. And whan the good lady was come againe to her selfe she sayde to Reynawde. Fayre sonne and howe durst you doo this that ye haue doon? For I promit you ye shal once repent for it. And your father shal be destroi∣ed therfore and cast out of his lōdes. And if he scape on liue it shal be great meruayl. So pray I you all my chil∣dren that ye flee awaye, but take a∣fore all my treasour. For yf youre fa∣ther come againe from the courte: he shall will yee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d you to the king Char¦lemayn. Lady said Reynawd weene ye y<SUP>t</SUP> our father is so cruel &amp; so wroth with vs that he wolde take &amp; deliuer vs in to the hādes of the kyng Char∣lemaine, that is oure greate enemye mortall?</P>
<P>REynawd, his three bretherne &amp; Mawgys wolde make no∣ne other soiournynge: but tooke so muche of the hauoyre and treasoure of theyr father and mother: that they had ynough of it. And thenne tooke theyr leue of their lady mother, wher∣of there was great pytie at the depar¦tinge. For the children wept tenderly and the mother also of the other side whan she saw that her children that thus went fro her &amp; wist not yf she should euer see them again: so depar∣ted the newe knightes with theyr cosin Mawgis and yssued out of the towne &amp; entred in to the greate forest of Ardeyne streyght through the va∣leye of Feyry, and rode so much that they came vpon the ryuer of Muse, and there they chose a faire grounde where they made to be buylded a fai∣re castell vpon a fayre roche muche stronge, &amp; at the foote of it: passed the saide riuer of Muse. And whan that the castell was made vp: they called it Mountaynford, &amp; as I trow there was not suche another of strengthe fro the said place vnto Mountpeller. For it was closed w<SUP>t</SUP> great walles &amp; enuyronned rounde about w<SUP>t</SUP> dyches sore deep, &amp; well garnished with all maner of vittailles &amp; of all thinges be nedeful to be had in a fortres, now doubte the newe knightes nothinge Charlemayn yf he wrought not by treason. Charlemayn was at paris much angry for y<SUP>e</SUP> deth of his neuew
<PB N="xvi" REF="21"/> Berthelot, the which Reinawd had slayne playing at the chesse as it is sayde, so made he to come afore hym the duke Aymon of dordonne the fa∣ther of the foure knightes, and made hym to swere that he shoulde neuer gyue no help to his children and that they shoulde neuer be the better of a peny by hym, &amp; in what place that he should them fynde he should take thē and shoulde bringe them to him, the which Aymon durste not saie ayenst hym, but sware that he should doo so wherof afterwarde he was sore re∣preued. And after that he had sworn thus he departed oute of Parys all wroth &amp; angrye of this that he muste chase thus his children: and came to Dordon. And whan the duches saw him she began to weep full sore: and the duke knew wel what she yeelde Lady said the duke where be my son∣nes gone. Syr sayde the ladye I can not telle whether they are drawen, but why suffred you that oure sonne Reynawde slewe Berthelot the ne∣uewe of kynge Charlemaine, ladye saide he I coude not doo therto, &amp; wit that oure sonne Reynawde is of so greate a strength that neuer syth the incarnacion of oure lorde was not seen so stronge a knyghte as he is. Nor all the assemble that than was in the pallays at Parys myghte not keep him, but that he slewe berthelot afore all the lordes that were there. And afore this our saide sonne Rey∣nawde demaunded of kinge Charle∣mayne ryght and reason to be doone to him of the deathe of my brother his vncle the duke Benes of Aygre∣mount, wherupon the king fulsham¦fullye and outerageouslye answered to our said sonne, wherfore Reinawd was wrothe and sore angred and y<SUP>e</SUP> cause why Reynawde slewe Berth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lot was for to aueng him of the king Charlemaine. Not withstandynge that Berthelot had Iniuryed oure sayde sonne ful sore at the playe of the chesse. And also he smote hym fyrste outrageously that the bloud came out of his face, so Reinawd for his great and hardy courage might not suffre this by no wise. And therfore the kīg hathe made me swere that yf I can take my chyldren that I shal brynge them to hym at Parys, and that no helpe they shal neuer haue of me nor succours, nor that they shall not be the better a peny of all my hauoure. Wherof I am wrothe and full sorye. ❧ We shall leaue heere to speake of the duke Aymon and of the duchelle that ben ryght sory for theyr children And shal shew you how the worthye kynge Charlemain made to seeke af∣ter the foure sonnes of Aymon tho∣roughe all his realme, but he myght not know nor vnderstande no tidin∣ges of them, tyll that at last came to hym a messenger that recounted to hym howe he had founde them in the forest of Ardeyne.

<P>NOwe sayth the hystorye that sith the time of the kinge A∣lexander: was none suche hearde as this same, &amp; therfore faire lordes plea¦se you heare and vnderstande how it befell of the foure sonnes of Aymon that were enmyes of the emperoure Charlemayne kynge of fraunce, for the same time king Charlemain had banyshed them oure of the realme of fraunce &amp; made all his barons bothe yonge &amp; olde to seeke after them, and also made thē swere that they should neuer helpe ne confort theym by no maner of wise. And the same oth had made with many other the olde duke Aimon theyr father as ye haue heard afore, wherof he was full sory after¦warde. It happed than that the kyng Charlemayne, helde a greate courte in Parys. And as this courte was assembled where all the barons of fraunce were togyther: a messenger came there before the kynge Charle∣mayne &amp; kneeled afore him and sayd Syr I brynge you tydynges of that ye dyd sende me for, wyt syr that I cam frō the great forest of Ardeyne, where I haue founde the foure son∣nes of Aimon that dwell there with in a stronge castell well sette vpon a roche, and if ye wyll fynde theym and be auenged of them: wyt that ye maye well ynough doo so as I by¦leue for certayne. Whā Charlemayne vnderstood this messenger: he began to meruayle hymselfe sore and called hys barons and sayd to them. Fayre lordes whan it is so that ye be heere: it apperteyneth not that I shoulde sende for you at your places. So I pray you and require as to my lyege men that ye help me to be auenged of the four sōnes of Aimō that so great domage haue doon to me as ye know well.</P>
<P>WHan the barons vnder∣stoode the prayer that the emperoure Charlemaine made to them: they answered with∣one voice. Sir we shal doo your com∣maūdement without doubt, gyue vs leaue if it please you that we may goe to our coūtries for to make vs ready to harueys and of horses, the which thing the king graunted them. And so departed al the barōs fro the court and went in to theyr countreys, the which abode not long that they came agayne to Parys all a rayed and rea∣dy for to warre with their army. And whan the kynge Charlemayne sawe them: he receyued them gladly, and in continent without anye taryinge he departed out of Parys, &amp; went with al his hoste to Mountiyon a towne of his, and there he laye that nyght. And at the morowe as soone as the daye appered: the kinge Charlemaine departed from Mountlyon and went on his wai with his hoste, &amp; ordeined y<SUP>e</SUP> foreward to the erle Guy of moūt∣peller that wolde much great harme to Reynawd, &amp; whan they had set thē selfe in the way: the emperour Char∣lemaine called to him his good vas∣seylles Renyer, Guyon of aubeford, the erle Garner, Gefray, Langon, Ogier the dane, Rycharde of Nor∣mandy, &amp; the duke Naymes of baui∣ere, and saide vnto them all. Lordes ye knowe well what ye haue to doo, I praye you that ye keep well your selfe from Reynawde and goe not to

<P>THan saide the duke Naimes of bauyere. Sir we shall doo so. Than made they the trompettes to be blowen, &amp; all the hoste they ma∣de to come togyther. And thus they rode so muche that they came to Mi∣leyne otherwise called Aspes, &amp; whā they were come there they sawe the castell of Mountaynforde, that Rei∣nawde &amp; his bretherne &amp; their cosyn Mawgis had doo make, euen at that houre that kinge Charlemayne and his hoste were com to Aspes, y<SUP>e</SUP> three bretherne of Reynawd were coming fro the chase oute of the wood of Ar∣deyn and Richard the yongest bare a right riche horne bothe fayre &amp; good: the which Reinawd loued full deare. And in their felawshyp myght well be .xx. knightes and no mo. And as they returned to Mountainforde Ri∣charde beheld and sawe ouer the Ry∣uer of Muse thoste of the king Char¦lemayn wherof he began to be sore merueylled, &amp; called Guycharde his brother &amp; said to hym. Fayre brother what folke maye be they that I see yonder I heard say the other day of a messenger that tolde it oure brother Reynawd: that the emperoure came for to besyege vs within our castell.</P>
<P>ANd after whan Guycharde vnderstoode his brother he be∣helde ouer the ryuer &amp; sawe the fore∣warde that Guyon conduyted, and whan Guychard sawe them he smot hys horse with his spurres, he &amp; his folke went ayenst Guyon, &amp; sayde to hym. Fayre syr what are these folke: syr sayde Guyon these been the folke of the emperoure Charlemaine that goeth to Ardeyn for to besyege a ca∣stell that the foure sonnes of Aymon haue doo make there, for theyr stren∣gthe they trauayle vs much, god gy∣ue them euyll rest. Certes said Guy∣charde I am a souldier with Rey∣nawde, &amp; con you nother thanke nor grace of that that ye saye, for I am holden to defend them at my power &amp; with this he spurred his horse, and smote the said Guion throughe hys sheelde so harde, that he ouerthrewe hym deade to the grounde, and than he tooke the horse of the sayde Guion and tooke him to one of his squyers and assembled al the knightes togyther of one parte &amp; of the other, they of Fraunce cried Mounridye saynte Denys, &amp; the bretherne of Reinawd cried mountaynforde. Than shoulde ye haue seen a fell batayle and ryght cruel the one aienst the other sheeldes broken and helmes broken, som dead and som sore wounded so muche that it was great pitre to see. What shall I tell you more al the folke of Guyō that made the forewarde were there slayne. This hangyng came a squiet to the king &amp; shewed him howe hys foreward was vtterly dystroyed, &amp; that Guycharde the brother of Rey∣nawd had slayne the earle Guyon.</P>

Whā Reinawd saw his brother come with so greate hauoyre: he went ayenst him &amp; kissed them al, &amp; than he said to Guychard, fayre brother where haue ye taken so greate hauoyre that ye bryng heere? syr sayde Guycharde I shall tell you tydynges wherof ye shall be greatly meruaylled. Nowe wyt that kynge Charlemain commeth for to besyege you with all his hoste &amp; hath so great chiualry with him that it is wonder for to see, my bretherne &amp; I come fro the chase out of the wode of Ardeyn &amp; we haue recountted the forewarde of Charlemain that the erle Guy con¦duyted, there foughte we togither w<SUP>t</SUP> them, but god be thanked &amp; my men: myne enemyes were discomsited &amp; ouerthrowen, one parte we haue slai∣ne: &amp; the other fled away, so haue we brought theyr hauoyre y<SUP>t</SUP> ye see heere. And there is dead the earle Guy and many other greate lordes &amp; all theyr men. Than sayd Reynawd I ought to loue you dearly whā ye canne war so wel that ye haue ouerthrowē your enemies at the fyrst comyng on, and than he called all his bretherne &amp; his folke and sayd to them, fayre lordes nowe is the time come that eueryche of vs must preue himself a good mā, wherfore I pray you that euery man force himselfe to doo worthily his de∣uoire that your worshippe and oures be kept, and that men may not wyt vs no towardes, &amp; let vs doo kno∣we oure prowesses to kinge Charle∣mayne so that he holde vs not for fe∣ble &amp; myschaunte, whan Reinawde had spoke to his brethren and to hys folke: they answered to hym in thys maner, my lorde haue no doubte of none of vs, but be sure that we shal neuer fayle you for the hewynge of our limmes as long as we shal liue, and whan Reinawde vnderstood the good wil of his folke and namely of his bretherne: he beganne againe to speke to thē and sayde let the gate be sherre and drawe vp the brydge, &amp; so go we to the windowes for to se this folke that come ayenst vs. And than they went there as Reinawd sayd, &amp; whan they loked out of the wyndo∣wes: they saw Ogyer the dane com∣minge with a thousand men w<SUP>t</SUP> him, whiche whā he saw that Guychard was entred into the castel: he retour∣ned agayne &amp; sayd to the king how it was, and than he sayd. Sir I let you wyt that the castel of Mountainford is the fairest &amp; the strongest that euer ye saw for it is set vpon a hye roche of harde stone, and well I tel you for certayne that it shall not be so taken so lyghtly as men ween. For suche folke doo keepe it that wel and wor∣thely shall defend it.</P>
<PB REF="24"/>
<P>WHan the Emperoure Charle∣mayne hearde speake Ogyer the dane: he was of it so wrothe that he went nyghe out of hys wyt, and sware god that he should neuer returne into Fraunce but that Rei∣nawde were take, and that yf he maye haue hym: all the worlde shall not saue hym but that he shall make him to be hanged &amp; his brother Guy∣chard to be drawen at horses tailles. syr said Ogier well ye oughte to doo so, for they haue trauaylled you full often and haue gyuen you greate la∣boure &amp; payne. Sir sayde Foulques of Morillon, haue no doubt for shor∣tely we shal auenge you of them, ma∣ke to be cried incontinent that youre hoste goe lodge lightly about Moun∣tenford, Certes said the king ye saye well and than he made trompettes to be blowen of a heyghte for to as∣semble togyther al his men of armes and commaunded that all the castell of Mountenforde should be enuyron∣ned rounde about with folke, &amp; that euery baron shoulde doo pyghte there his pauillion, and they dyd so as the king had commaunded. Now wyl I shewe to you how noble the castel was set. The said castell was closed &amp; set vpō a hie roche, &amp; of the one side of it was beting a great riuer called Muse, &amp; of the other side it had euyn at hand a great woodful pleasaunt, of a nother syde it hath a fayre plai∣ne, and of that othersyde a full faire medowe greate and pleasaunt to be∣holde. ¶ Whan the folke of the king Charlemaine were allodged: them∣perour lighted on horsebacke with a few felawship for to see the strength of the castell, &amp; when he had well be∣holden it &amp; seen at his case: he began to say in him self, ha god how is this castell closed &amp; set in a stronge place god how these knightes know wel y<SUP>e</SUP> crafte of warre, not withstandinge y<SUP>t</SUP> they be but yonge folke, fayre lordes thinke to warre wel, for we haue som¦what more to doo thā I wende, whā y<SUP>e</SUP> pauillions &amp; tentes of y<SUP>e</SUP> kinges were dressed vp: he made to be set a charbonkle right rich all hye on hys tente whiche stone full precious was shining as a torche y<SUP>t</SUP> brēneth, &amp; with the same a great appell of fine golde of great value, &amp; whan the said tents were al spred &amp; hanged: themperoure entred within &amp; made the duke Nay∣mes to be armed, &amp; charged him that no man of warre so hardy for to light on horsbacke of eyghte dayes, but it were for to sporte himself. For I wil doo know through al the realme that men brynge to vs vitayles in greate habundaunce afore that y<SUP>e</SUP> castell of moūtenforde be by vs assayled, and make my chappel to be apparailed to thend that we pray god y<SUP>t</SUP> he wil help vs to be auenged of y<SUP>t</SUP> four sonnes of Aimon the which we shall famish or euer it be a moneth. For they shal not can haue no vitailes fro w<SUP>t</SUP>out by no way, thas said y<SUP>t</SUP> duke Naimes to the kīg, sit you mai doo better if it be your pleasure, send a messager to Reinaw∣de to tel him that he yeeld to you gui∣chard his brother, &amp; ye shal quite him al his londe, &amp; if he yeeld him to you: make him to be beheaded anon, &amp; if y<SUP>t</SUP> Reinawd refuse for to do this he mai wel be sure y<SUP>t</SUP> warre shal not leue him as long as he shal be aliue, than an∣swered
<PB N="xix" REF="24"/> Charlemain, ye saye well and ryght wysely, but certainlye I wote not where to fynde a messenger, to whom I myght well trust. Syr said the duke Naymes, yf it please you, Ogier and I shal doo thys message. It please me well sayde the king, and ryghte greate thanke I shall conne you for it, for ye neuer fayled me at a need. Than went Naymes, and Ogyer and made theym ready, and whan they were ready: they tooke in theyr handes braunches of Olyue tree for to shew that they were mes∣sengers, and so went they both togi∣ther without any other company, &amp; whan Alays that kept watche sawe that two knights come: he went &amp; as∣ked theym what knightes they were that came there. Syr saide the duke Naymes, we been messengers of the kynge Charlemaine that hathe sent vs hyther for to speake with Rey∣nawd the sonne of Aymon, and incō∣tynent the saide Alays went to hys lorde and tolde him howe at the gate were two messengers of the kinge Charlemayn that wolde speake with him, Reinawde commaunded forth∣with that the gate shoulde be opened to them &amp; that the drawbrydge should be let downe for he wold see the mes∣sengers &amp; speake with theym. Than were the two batons let in &amp; brought afore Reynawde, and whan Rey∣nawd saw them: he salued them cur∣tously, and after that they had salu∣ted eche other: they set them al there vpon a benche. And than began the duke Naymes to speake &amp; said thus. Reynawde saide he, the emperoure Charlemaine of Fraunce lette you wyt by vs, that ye sent to him Gui∣charde your brother to make of hym his pleasure and his will, and yf ye wyl not doo so: Charlemayne defy∣eth you, and sayth that neuer he shall leaue you vnto the tyme that he shall haue you all, and whan he shall haue you: he shal make you al to be drawen and hanged, and dye an euyll deathe with great shame.</P>
<P>WHan Reynawde vnder∣stoode these wordes: he wexed all red for angre, &amp; than he saide to the duke Naymes. Bi the faith that I owe to al my freē∣des, if it were not that I loue you: I should make you both to be hewen al to peces, and ye haue wel deserued it. For you Naymes are my nigh kins∣man, &amp; as me semeth ye oughte well to helpe and defende me ayenste all men, and ye now counseyl me to my great dyshonoure &amp; ayenst mine ho∣nesty. Tell to Charlemaine that he shal not haue Guichard my brother, &amp; that he leaue his thretenyng &amp; doo the worst that he can, for we shal not doo for hym nor for hys thretnyn∣ges the mountenaunce of a peny, and goe you to tel him in my behalfe that afore that he take vs: he shall haue a greater need of helpe than he weneth, Now voyde from our syght lyghte∣ly oute of oure palays, for to see you thus heere greueth me to sore. Whan the duke Naimes &amp; ogier vnderstood Reinawd: they made no lenger dwel∣lyng, but departed incontinent with out any more speaking, and are come to Charlemaine &amp; recounted to him all this that Reinawd had sayed.</P>
<PB REF="25"/>
<P>WHan the emperour Charlemai∣ne vnderstood this answere: he was so sore an angred that he went almost oute of his wyt, and thā he commaūded that the castel should be assayled to the whiche they sawe but three gates. Wherof was set afo∣re the maysters gate, their Reiner, &amp; Folques of Morylion, the earle of Neuers, and Ogier the dane. And a∣fore the second gate: was the duke of Bourgoin &amp; the erle of Alphinors, &amp; afore the thirde gate: was y<SUP>t</SUP> olde Ay∣mon the father of Reinawd that was come to Charlemayn for to warre a∣yenst his sonnes as thother. Nowe weneth themperour to haue besieged well Reinawde and his bretherne, but and god keep Reinawde in good helthe: Coarlemayne shall lese there more than he shall wynne. Reynaw∣de and his brethern were such knigh¦tes &amp; so sage that they defended well their castell ayenst Charlemayn, al∣wayes it was besieged with so great numbre of folke as I haue sayde a∣fore that it was merueyll to see for there were bretons fleminges maun∣sealx, origners, english bourgoines, the bauyers and the frensheman, but Reynawd made one thinge that tur∣ned hym to a great worshyp. For he sayde to his folke fairelordes I pray you that ye mounte not vpon youre horse tyl that ye heare the trompet∣tes blowe. For I see wel that Char∣lemaines folke ben right sore trauai∣led, and nowe while they been thus wery: it were no worship to vs for to tenne them vpon, but whā they shal be a litill cased of their wyrenes: we shall thanne make dyligentlye and worthely our first yssue vpon them, and I praye you and require you all in general, that euery man shew than his prowesse and strength, and wyt it that in the castell of Mountenford was a faucebray vpon a roche, tho∣rough the which Reinawd and hys brethern went out vnder couerte at all tymes that they wolde withoute daunger.</P>
<P>wHan Reynawd saw that it was time fo to goe oute vpon their enmies: he cal∣led to him Sampson of bourdelloys, this was a knight a trusty man that was come there for to help Reynaw∣de and his bretherne, and hadde with him an hundred knightes, Reynawd said to him, sit it is nowe tyme that our cumies know what we been, for if we tary lenger: the kinge Charle∣main mought wit vs of cowardnes, And whan he had said these wordes: he came to his brother Guicharde, &amp; saide to him. Faire brother Guichar∣de, leaue not for to be alwayes bolde and hardy as longe that I am a man on liue, for I loue you as much as I doo myne own body, and it is reason that I doo so, for ye &amp; I are bretherne bothe of father and mother and also I beleue ye be the best knighte of my lygnage. And than he taketh hym betwene hys armes and kyssed him by greate loue, and whan he hadde doone thus: he sayde. Brother ma∣ke the Trompettes to blowe vp of heyght, and lette vs make ready our selfe for to yssue oute for to shewed Charlemayne what folke that we bē
<PB N="xx" REF="25"/> yf god wyll that we might take the erle of Estampes I should be therof ryght glad. For it is the mā, among all our enemies y<SUP>t</SUP> worste dooth to vs, y<SUP>t</SUP> more hath hurted vs, happely he shal not scape vs, for he is alwai∣es in the forwarde, whan these wor∣des were fynysshed: all the foure bre∣therne and al them of theyr compa∣nye arayed them self and yssued out of the castell at the fawcebray, wyth out to make any noyse nor crye, and so gone they vpon the hoste of Char∣lemayne by so great wrath? y<SUP>t</SUP> it was marueyle, and begā to make so great destruccion of folke and to cast bothe tentes and pauyllions a groūd: that it was wonder and pitie for to see. And who had seene than Reynawd the worthy knight vpon hys horse bayarde, and the faytes of armes y<SUP>t</SUP> he made vpon his enemyes: should haue great merueyl, for to looke vp∣on him, for that man y<SUP>t</SUP> he recoūtred myght well say that he was borne in an euyll houre, for to say the trou∣th Reinawde smote no knight so that his stroke came ryght but that he cle∣ued hym as lyghtly as thy had not ben armed. Whan the folke of Char∣lemayne saw theyr enemyes: they rā incontynent to their harneyes and whan they were armed they ran vp∣pon Reynawde and his folke, &amp; than began the batyle so cruell: y<SUP>t</SUP> it was pytie for to see. For ye should haue sene many speres broken, and seel∣des broken and clouen a fondre, and many a good haubergen vnmayled corsettes &amp; flancardes all to broken and sore beaten, and so many a good¦ly man and noble knyghtes beyenge full myserably vpon the earth. Whā y<SUP>t</SUP> olde Aymon heard y<SUP>e</SUP> crye: he moū∣ted on horsbacke also sone as he mi∣ghte he and his folke and came to y<SUP>e</SUP> batayll ayenste his sōnes, and whā Reynawde apperceyued there his fa¦ther: he was right sory for it, &amp; sayd to hys brethern. See here is a greate meruayle, for her is our father and by my counsell we shall make hym runne. For I wolde not for nothīg that none of vs should set vpon him And than they turned at another si∣de of the batayle: but Aymon theyr father came there agaynst them and began to set sore harde vpon them &amp; theyr folke. And whan Renawde sawe that hys father leyd sore vpon them and bare them greate domage of theyr men: he sayd to him al an an¦gred. Ha father what doo you? certay¦nely ye doo great sīne. For ye should helpe defende and kepe vs, &amp; ye doo to vs worse thā the other doo. Now I see well that ye loue vs so lytle, and that ye be dyspleased that we bē so pru and so good men of armes a∣gaynst Charlemayne, for yf ye haue forbanysshed vs: wel we knowe it, and that we shall neuer haue nothīg of your herytage and we haue made this lytle castell for to kepe our selfe therin, and yet ye come hether for to helpe it to be destroyed. It is no Fa∣thers werke, but it is operacion of the deuyl, yf ye wil doo vs no good: at least doo vs no harme, For I swe¦re you vpon all Sayntes that yf ye come any ferther agaynst vs I shal forbere you no longer, but I shall gyue you wyth my swerde suche a strooke that ye shall haue no leyser
<PB REF="26"/> for to repent you of the folye that ye doo. Whan Aymon vnderstode the wordes of his sonne Reynawde. he tooke therof so greate angre an hys hert that it lacked lytle but that he fell downe in a swoune to the erth, for he knew well y<SUP>t</SUP> Reynawde tolde hym trouth. But he could doo none otherwyse for feare of Charlemayn but alwayes he wyth drew himself a backe, &amp; suffred his sonnes to passe by hym harmles at that tyme. The wyche went and dommaged right sore the folke of king Charlemayne.</P>
<P>DVrynge the tyme that Rey∣nawde spake thus to his fa∣ther Aymon: came Charlemayne &amp; Aulbery, Ogyer, and the erle Henry and Foulques of Morillon. And whan Reynawde sawe them come: he made hys trompettes to be blowē for to brīg his folke together again, &amp; whan they were assembled of one parte &amp; of the other: a knyght of char∣lemayne y<SUP>t</SUP> was called Thiery made hys horse to renne agaynst the folke of Reynawde, and whan Alarde saw hym come: he spurred hys horse and came agaynst him and smote him so harde in hys sheeld: that he shoued a great hauberke that he bare through the body of hym, so y<SUP>t</SUP> the sayd Thy∣ery fell dead downe to the erth. And whan kyng Charlemayne saw falle dead his knight Thieri: he was ther¦fore so sore angred that almoste he lost his wit and his vnderstandyng. Than began he to crye wyth a hye voyce, sayinge in this maner. Lor∣des and barons deliuer you for to a∣uenge me of these gluttons that le∣den our folke so cursedly. See that they ben wel punysshed &amp; sharpelye, whan the olde Aymon heard Char∣lemayne speake thus: for doubt to be blamed he spurred hys horse &amp; went and smote one of his sonnes knigh∣tes that was named amaney so cru∣elly with his brand of steele, that he smote his head cleane of fro y<SUP>e</SUP> shoul∣ders of hym, father (cryed Reynaw∣de to hym) ye doo yl whan so cruelly ye slea my men, but by the fayth that I owe to god if I trowed not to hurt therbi my honour: I should take ther¦of cruell vengeaunce. And than said agayne the valiaunt Reynawde, Ha lady mother how should ye be sorye yf ye knewe the great werkes and y<SUP>e</SUP> great harme that our father doth to vs this day.</P>

<P>WHan Foulques of Moril∣lonsaw that the folke of Reynawde maīteined thē selfe so worthely agaynst them: he be¦gan to cry. Sir Emperour and king what meaneth this? I beleue that ye beforgottē, send for many of your tolke and cūmaunde them that they take incontynent the traytours that now fayne themselfe agaynst youre enemyes, &amp; without delay make thē to be hanged and slayne all quicke. whan the Frenche men vnderstode this that Foulques sayd to Charle∣mayne: they made nnoe other abydīg but spurred theyr horses and smote vpon the folke of Reinawde so hard, that they made them to recule backe wolde they or not, whan Alarde saw hys folke goe backe: he was ryght sorye for it, and tooke his swerde and began w<SUP>t</SUP> his folke to make so great effors of armes: that the frenche mē were all abasshed of it. what shall I tell you more of this batayles wyt it that it was so meruaylous &amp; cruel, that it was pitie for to see, for euery one made the worste that he could, y<SUP>e</SUP> one agaynst the other. And wit that the foure sonnes of Aymon made so great occision of men &amp; of horses: y<SUP>e</SUP> none durst come afore thē, but none might compare w<SUP>t</SUP> Reynawde for to doo well. For he made there so great meruaile of armes: that the frenche men durst not come forth for feare of him, for to say the trouth Reynawde smote no stroke a right, but that he
<PB REF="27"/> slew him where vpō it lighted. What will ye y<SUP>t</SUP> I tell you more? Wyt y<SUP>t</SUP> in thys batayle kynsmen nor parentes spared not eche other for they slew y<SUP>e</SUP> one y<SUP>t</SUP> other as dōbe beastes. There should ye haue sene coming through the battayle the kyng yon of sayncte Omars that rode vpon a good horse that ranne well, &amp; agaynst him came a knyght called Guyon, &amp; yon smote Guyon suche a stroke: that he ouer∣threw both horse and man to y<SUP>e</SUP> erth, &amp; whan Reynawde saw this he was ryght wroth for it. And thā he tooke hys baner &amp; sayd to hys folke doo so muche that I haue that good horse, for yf he goth away: I shall neuer ha∣ue Ioye at my herte. for I wyll that he kepe felawshyp to Bayarde. And whan Richard his brother that was so worthy a knyght and so gentyll vnderstode his brother that so spake: he made no taryeng but spurred hys horse and smote yon of saynt omars so harde y<SUP>t</SUP> hys sheelde nor hys har∣neys might not kepe, but that he sho¦ued hys glaue through the brest and ouerthrew him dead to the erth and than Richarde tooke the horse by the brydell &amp; led hym to Reynawde and sayd to hym, syr we haue the horse y<SUP>t</SUP> ye haue called after so sore. Nowe maye you lyght vpon hym whan it please you, brother sayd Reynawde gramercy of this present, for wel ye haue serued me therof.

<P>ANd whan Reynawde came agayne to the bataile: he saw yet his father, and whan he saw him he was right sori for it so that he lost almost his wit for the same and cam &amp; sayd to hī by a maner of reproche, by my fayth father ye are greatly to blame: ye myght well kepe your selfe that ye come not so often to se vs, &amp; for to doo vs harme.

<PB N="xxii" REF="27"/> to the ground. Whan Charlemayne saw his squier dead: he spurred hys courser wyth an angry there &amp; had in his hande a staffe of yron, for he wolde parte the batayle a sonder, by cause he saw well that hys folke had that worse &amp; that they myght resyste agaynst y<SUP>e</SUP> great strokes of Reynawde in no wyse, for it was meruaylous for to see the great faytes of armes that he made there, for he ouerthrew downe dead both horses and men by great strength.</P>
<P>CHarlemayne is commen to the Frenche mē, and commaunded them for to withdraw them self, for it was tyme for to departe fro y<SUP>e</SUP> ba∣tayle, &amp; as they wolde haue gone a way: came therethrough batayle Be¦rarde the bourgoyner &amp; smote Sy∣mon of Bremoys so fyersly: that he fell downe dead to the ground, whā the foure sonnes of Aymon saw Si∣mon dead: they were right sorye for hym, and spurred theyr horses wyth the spurres &amp; came at that syde and brake the prese for to venge Simōs death, &amp; wyt it whā Reynawde was come there it was knowē right wel for he w<SUP>t</SUP> his swerd brought to death wel three hundred knightes of the best men that kynge Charlemayne had in his company. Whereof y<SUP>e</SUP> king was right sori &amp; sore an angred, this hanging: Alarde wēt through y<SUP>e</SUP> prese so came he &amp; Iousted agaynst the erle Estāpes, &amp; his sheelde he letted not but he shoued his spere through the body of him, and thus was by hym slayne the sayd erle, whan that Rey∣nawde saw that stroke: he came to Alarde his brother &amp; kissed him vpon his helme &amp; bowed himselfe toward him and said faire brother blessed be the wōbe that bare thee, for ye haue auenged vs of y<SUP>e</SUP> greatest foe that we had. And whan he had said this word he made his trompettes to be blowē for to call his men together.</P>
<P>WHan the Emperour Charle∣mayne sawe this greate do∣mage that the foure sonnes of Ay∣mon dyd to hym: he cryed wyth a hye voyce. Lordes &amp; barons withdrawe our selfe a backe, for our enemyes be to good knight{is} for vs, nowe is this to vs great dyshonour &amp; great mys∣happe let vs returne agayne to our pauilions I pray you. For I swere vpon all Sayntes that theyr castell shall neuer be taken but by famis∣shing, for they ben ouer good knigh∣tes preu and wise &amp; well aduised of y<SUP>e</SUP> warre. Whan the barons of Charle∣mayne heard this commaundement they sayd, syr we shall do your wyl, &amp; as they wolde haue departed: came Reynawde spurring hys horse, and his brethern, &amp;c wēt and smote vpon the folke of y<SUP>e</SUP> Emperour so sharply: that he departed them so well, y<SUP>t</SUP> they muste needes flee &amp; take theyr pauy∣lions, and so bode wyth them pryso∣ners Anthony Guyemaulte the erle of Neners, &amp; Theirri of Normandi for no man myght endure agaynste Reynawde and his brethern. And whan Reynawde sawe the dyscomfi∣ture and the folke of the Emperour that fled: he made his trompettes to be blowen for to w<SUP>t</SUP>draw his folke. And whan they were assembled: Rey∣nawde and his bretherne retourned
<PB REF="28"/> gladly into theyr castel. And was al∣wayes the hindermoste man for to kepe his folke the better that led pri∣soners afore, Then came Aymon theyr father afresshe vpon them and began to make thē great compraūce and whan Reynawde sawe his fa∣ther: he wēd for to haue waxed mad for angre, so retourned he bayarde &amp; smote the horse of his father so hard that he fell downe dead to the erth. For as of his father he wolde not touche, and whan Aymon saw him selfe a grounde: he rose vp quickelye vpon his feete and tooke his swerde in his hande, &amp; began ryght well to defende himselfe. But his defence should haue ben full lytle worthe to him, for his childrē should haue take him for theyr prisoner yf it had not ben Ogier the Dane that cam &amp; suc∣coured hym. And than sayde to hym the sayd Ogyer. Syr what semeth you of your children, they be ryght cheualrous and hardy as ye may see and knowe.</P>
<P>WHan Aymon was horsed agayne: he pursued his children as a man wroth &amp; out of his wit, and said to his folke Now goe we after the glotons, for if they lyue longe: they shall do vs har∣me and domage so great that wyth payne it shalbe recouered. Whā Rey∣nawde saw his father that folowed them so sharply: he turned Bayarde and wēt and smote amonge the thic∣kest of his fathers folke and began to hurt them so sore with the help of his brethren, y<SUP>t</SUP> he put them to flight maugre their teeth. For they might no longer endure y<SUP>e</SUP> great maugre y<SUP>u</SUP> Reynawde bare to them, for to saye the trouth: no harneys was nought worthe agaynst the swerde of Rey∣nawde. For he cleued all that he rought.</P>
<P>ANd whan themperour Char∣lemayne sawe this hye pro∣wesse that Reynawde made: he bles∣sed hymselfe of the great meruayle that he had therof, and so stronge he spurred his horse that he wēt against Reynawde, and than he sayd to him Reynawde I forbyde you that ye go no ferther. Whan Reynawde saw the kyng: he made to hym reuerence and than withdrew himself abacke. And sayd to hys men, let vs goe fourth, for here cometh the kynge. I wolde not for nothing in this worlde that any of you should laye hande vpon hym. Whan the folke of Reynawde vnderstode these wordes: they put theyr swerdes in theyr shethes and went agayne vnto theyr castel right glad of theyr fayre auenture y<SUP>t</SUP> was happend to them that daye. And whā that they were within theyr Castell of Mountaynforde: they made the drawe brydge for to be drawen vp, &amp; went and vnarmed them and foūde the supper redy, and so they set them selfe at the table. And there was a great mainy of prisoners. And whā thei had eaten and dronken their fil Reynawde came to hys brother and thanked hym muche with al his hert of that he had slayne the erle of Es∣tampes.</P>

<P>ANd whan themperour Char¦lemayne saw that Renawde was with in his Castell: he lighted downe from his horse into his tente and sware by god y<SUP>t</SUP> he should neuer departe from thence vnto the tyme y<SUP>t</SUP> he should haue the foure sonnes of Aymon or that the castell were take. ¶ What shall I tell more? them∣perour Charlemayne lay well .xiiii. monethes at syege afore y<SUP>t</SUP> castell of Mountaynforde, and there was no weke, but they had a batayle or a scar¦myshe, &amp; I tell you that Reynawde was not so sore besyeged, but that he went to chase in woodes and in ry∣uers as often as hym pleased. And dyuerse tymes it happed that Rey∣nawde spake wyth the Frenche mē of trayte the one to the other, sayinge thus to them. Fayre Lordes I pray you that ye speake to the Emperour Charlemayne &amp; tel hym that he shal neuer take vs by no force, for our ca¦stell is right stronge and well garni∣shed. But know the kynge one thing that whiche he may haue by good∣nes, he need not make by force. He may haue the castell and vs also yf it please hym in such maner as I shal tell you. Whan I shal put in his hād the castel of Mountaynforde my bre∣therne and my selfe, our goodes and bagage saufe, &amp; that the warre take an ende that hath lasted so longe? he may be well content. Reynawde said Ogier the Dane ye say wel and wise¦ly, &amp; I promyt you I shall shew the same to the kinge as ye haue sayd, &amp; yf ye will beleue my coūsell: I ensure you I shall tell hym that ye doo so for ye are not folke for to be set lytel by thus, nor for to be for the courte, for yf the kinge had you nyghe him, he soulde be the better for it.</P>
<P>ALl thus as Reynawde &amp; O∣gier spake together, there ca∣me Forques of Morillon that cried to Reynawde vassayle yee be but a tool, for certes I haue heard youre wordes well, ye shall leue vs Moū∣taynforde for it is not your herytage and your heades in lykewyse, Foul∣ques sayd Reynawde ye haue repre∣ued me full often.

<P>Certes I could not doo therto, but I was full sory for it god wot it, It is trouth whan we played together we had some wordes, by whyche with∣out any wordes he gaue me suche a stroke vpon my face that the bloud ranne downe at the groūd. And whā I saw my selfe so armed. I myght not be so soft that I could endure y<SUP>e</SUP> great ontrage that he had doone to me with out a cause. So defended I my selfe to my power. For who let∣teth hym selfe to be slayne his soule shal neuer haue pardon. And thou knowest wel Foulques y<SUP>e</SUP> I dyd was in my defēdyng. But to this must be made shorte wordes, and if it please you, ye shal tel to y<SUP>e</SUP> king charlemain that he taketh vs to mercy, and that we may be freendes. And yf ye doo thys: ye shall doo your honoure.</P>
<P>For as soone may ye be slayne there as a nother. Than sayde Foulques by god all thys is nought worth vn∣to
<PB REF="29"/> you, for ye shall die therfore ye and your brethern. Foulques sayd Rey∣nawde ye threten to muche, it apper∣teineth not to you for to threten kni∣ghtes so muche that ben better than you, and yf ye haue ony thyng vpon your hert: doo it wythout any more wordes, for I tell you well that ye purchace your death. And whanne Reynawde had sayd these wordes: they wente agayne to theyr pauyly∣ons. And thus abode the hoste vnto than without any fyghtyng, but the frechemen came agayn wolde they or not, wherfore the kynge Charle∣mayne was wrothe.</P>
<P>THan the Emperour Charle∣mayne sent for men through all hys lande, and whan they were all come: he sayd to them. Syres I complayne me to you of the foure sonnes of Aymon that hath my lād destroyed and wasted. And Mountaynforde is so stronge: y<SUP>t</SUP> bi strength it can neuer be taken, but by famys∣shyng. Now tell me what I ought to doo? for I shall doo therin your counsell, whan the barons heard the complaynt that the kynge made to them of the foure sonnes of Aymō: there was none so hardy y<SUP>e</SUP> durst say a worde, but y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Naymes of Ba¦uiere that sayd to the king. Syr em∣perour yf ye wyll haue good coūsel: I shall gyue you good, yf ye wyl be∣leue me. Let vs retourne nto hyghe Fraunce, for we be to nighe the win¦ter for to make warre. And whan y<SUP>t</SUP> newe tyme shalbe come: ye shal mow come agayne to lay your syege afore Mountaynforde. For I doo you to vnderstond y<SUP>t</SUP> Reynawde is not sore presed, but that he goeth in wodes &amp; in riuers at all tymes that he wyl. And a man that may goe out and in at his wil: is not ouer sore besieged. And of the other parte Reynawde and hys bretherne are suche knygh∣tes that they shall not be lyghtly o∣uercome. This is my coūsel syr who knoweth a better: let hym tell.</P>
<P>THen spake Hornier of Sauey¦ne, and to him said, syr I shal gyue you a better counsell yf ye wil beleue me, gyue me the castell and al the hauoyre that is with in and the Lordshyp fyue myles aboute it: and I shall yelde to you Reynawde and al his brethern for prysoners afore a moneth cum to an ende. And thā shal we goe into Fraunce for to see oure wyues and children. Hernyer sayd y<SUP>e</SUP> kyng, ye haue sayd well and wysely yf ye may doo thys that ye haue said, I graunt to you the castell and all y<SUP>t</SUP> ye haue asked with y<SUP>e</SUP> same. Syr said Hernyer I thanke you for it an hū∣dred thousād tymes. And I promys you I shall delyuer vnto you Rey∣nawde and hys bretherne as youre prisoners or euer y<SUP>t</SUP> a moneth be pas∣sed. But knowe you that Hernyer dyd mysse of his enterpryse, for he kept not couenaunt to the kynge as he had promised him: for Reinawde tooke hym and made hym to be he∣wen all in peces, and made all they that were wyth hym whan he made the treason to be hanged and slayne, as more playnly ye shall vnderstand here after, yf that ye lyste to harken.</P>
<PB N="xxiiii" REF="29"/>
<P>HErnier of Saueyn made none other taryenge, but he sayd to kyng Charlemayne in this maner.</P>
<P>Syr cōmaunde ye Guyon of Bour∣gone that he doo put in array a thou¦sand knightes well armed, and that to morrow afore the day he goe vpon the moūtayne fayre and softly with out noyse, &amp; I shall put hym within the castell shortly. Whan he had sayd this: he went to hys tente, &amp; made hī¦selfe to be armed. And whan he was armed: he lyghted a horsbacke, and rode to the gate of the castell, &amp; sayd to them that kepte warde. Alas for god fayre lordes haue mercye of me if it please you let me in, or els I am but dead, for the Emperour Charle∣mayne maketh to folow and seke me all aboute, for to make me dye by¦cause I haue said to him much good of Reynawde, &amp; also I tell you wel y<SUP>t</SUP> I shall shew to Reynawde a thing wherof he shall he ryght glad yf hys pleasure is to heare me.</P>
<P>WHan they y<SUP>t</SUP> were aboue v¦pon y<SUP>e</SUP> gate heard hī speak thus they without lōg ta∣ryeng let goe downe the draw bridge and made him come in, &amp; dysaimed him &amp; did to him great honour. But the false traytour rewarded thē full yll for it after that. This hangyng: Charlemayne commaunded Guion to make him redy, &amp; a thousand kni∣ghtes with him, and sent them vpon the hylle, without makyng of anye bruyte tyll that the day were come.</P>
<P>And wyt that Guyon had wyth hym of the best Knyghtes of Charle∣mayne.</P>
<P>NOw is Harnyer y<SUP>e</SUP> traytour within the castell of Moun∣taynforde, vnto whome men made good cheere. And whan Reynawde wyste that a knight of Charlemayn was come: He sayde that he wolde speake w<SUP>t</SUP> hym. And so he was brou∣ght afore hym. And whan he sawe him: he sayd to hī. What be you fayre knighte that are come hither? And he answered, syr my name is Her∣nier of Saueyne, &amp; I haue angred kinge Charlemayne for the loue of you and for this cause I am com hi∣ther praying that ye haue me for re∣commaūded, for I wot not whether to goe nowe. Good freend sayd Re∣nawde, syth that ye say y<SUP>t</SUP> ye be oure freend: ye be ryght welcome to me.</P>
<P>For of suche goodes that God hath sent me ye shall not fayle. Now tell me I pray you how doth the hoste of the Emperour? Haue they anye great plentie fo vytayles. Syr sayd Hernyer they ben scarse wyth them. But I tell for very certayne y<SUP>t</SUP> they shall goe theyr wayts within these fourty dayes, for none of the barōs wyll no lenger abyde there. Where∣fore the kyng Charlemayne is sore an angred with them. And I promit you yf the hoste wente awaye ye mi∣ght hurte theym ryght verye sore, and gette verye muche good, yf ye wyll sette then vpon the tayle of them. Freende sayde Reynawde to hym, ye haue comforted me ryght well, yf it is so as ye say, For yf the king Charlemayne be once ouerthro¦wen: he shall not come a nother ty∣me vpon vs wyth so good a wyll as he dooth nowe. And then Rey∣nawde
<PB REF="30"/> had hym wyth hym to hys brethern, that made vnto hym good cheere. And whan the supper was redy: Reynawde and his bretherne set thē downe vnto theyr meat and supped gladly. And in theyr compa∣nye was the traytour Hernier, vnto whom they made good cheere. After supper all the knyghtes wente to slepe. For they were wery of bearīg of theyr Harneys, and they had not ceased to fyght all that day. And wit that Hernier was well and honest∣ly brought to bed. For Reynawde had so commaunded. And whan all the knyghtes were fast a slepe: Her∣nier as the false Iudas slepte not.</P>
<P>But he rose and tooke hys harneys and armed hym selfe. And whan he was well armed at his ease: he came to the drawe bridge, and cut the cor∣des that kept it vp, and let the draw brydge go downe, and than he went vpon the walles where he found him that made the watche and slew him. And whā he had doone this: he came to the gate and opened it. For he had taken the keyes from hym that he had slayne, whyche had them in his kepyng.</P>
<P>THan whan Guyon of Bour∣goyne saw the gate open: he made no tarying, but came and en∣tred into the castell, and al hys folke with hym. And began to kylle and flea all thē that they found. ¶ Now shall ye heare of the fayre aduenture how that Reynawde &amp; his brethern were saued from this mortall slaw∣ghter. Wyt that whan the yemen of the stable had supped: thei were drōke and went to theyr bed, &amp; whan they were a slepe: the horse of Alarde y<SUP>t</SUP> was sōwhat proude began to make noyse agaynst the other. And Alarde and Richarde heard the noyse of the horses, they rose vp and saw y<SUP>e</SUP> doore of the halle open, and perceyued out of it the harneys y<SUP>t</SUP> glystered agaynst the moone that shone full bryght.</P>
<P>Than went they to the bedde where they had brought the false Hernyer, whyche they foūd not there. Whereof they were ryght sore abasshed. And than was Reynawde awaked, and asked who was there that maketh thys noyse. Let our knyghtes take theyr rest, that haue so sore trauay∣led all the day it is euyl doone for to go thus stampyng at this houre, thā cryed Alarde to Reinawde and sayd. Fayre brother we ben betrayed, for Hernyer that false knyght hath put the folke of Charlemayne within thys castell, the whiche kyll and slea your folke and put them to a greate matter, whan Reynawde vndestode this: he made no taryīg, but he arose and armed hymself quickly, and cri∣ed vnto his brethern and to his men, Now my freendes let vs beare our selfe worthy, we had neuer so great need, any wyt that Reynawde had w<SUP>t</SUP> hym but .xxx. Knyghtes within the dongeon of that fortresse, for al the other were within y<SUP>e</SUP> base courte whi∣che was as it had ben a lytle towne well peopled, where as Guyon of Bourgoyne &amp; his folke slew them.</P>
<P>This hanging: Reynawde &amp; his bre∣thern had armed themselfe right wel hopynge for to defende theymselfe well.</P>
<PB N="xxv" REF="30"/>
<P>THan came Hernyer the tray∣tour steryng about throughe the maystres strete &amp; with him well an hundred knightes. Thā sayd Rei¦nawde to hys brethern, fayre Lor∣des come forth, for yf god helpe vs not: we are all lost, &amp; than Reynawde and his brethern came to the gate, &amp; defended so well y<SUP>e</SUP> none durst passe but he was slayne, what shall I tell you more? the base courte began to be sore moued, and the erye was so great, for al them of the dongeon de∣fended themselfe valyantlye. Whan the folke of the Emperour Charle∣mayne sawe that they that were w<SUP>t</SUP>∣in the dongeon defended themselfe so well: they set y<SUP>e</SUP> base court in a fire and began to brenne, and pul down the houses and al that they founde. And y<SUP>e</SUP> fyre was soone so great that it tooke the dongeon of the castell.</P>
<P>Whan Reynawde saw that he was so taken wyth fyre: he was sore an∣gred and sayd to hys brethern what shall we doo here? for yf we tary any lenger we shall all be brent or taken and yf it were not the fyre that thus warreth agaynst vs: I make myne a uowe to god that we should yet caste this folke out of thys castell, but syn that the fyre is in it: we cannot kepe it no lenger. And than he sayd to his bretherne, come all after me &amp; they went to the fausebray that was all wayes open, and yssued out he &amp; his brethern &amp; his folke with them, and whan they were out: than were they more abasshed than they were afore for they wyst not whether to goe.</P>
<P>Now heare how they dyd as wor∣thy knightes. For whā they saw the castell brenne: they entred wythin a pyt that was there vnder the erthe, for feare of the fyre &amp; set the dore vp∣on them, &amp; there they began to defēd themselfe so strongly: that none en∣tred therein but he lost anon hys head. And whan Hernyer the tray∣tour was aware of y<SUP>e</SUP> same: he tooke his folke with him &amp; came to y<SUP>e</SUP> pyt &amp; began to assayle Reynawde sharp∣ly and his brethern, and al they that were therin with them, &amp; wyt it that there at thentre of the sayd pyt were made great faytes of armes for they of within defended themself so wel: y<SUP>t</SUP> none myght come in but he were dead anon. ¶ Whyle that the foure sonnes of Aymon were in y<SUP>t</SUP> pyt vn∣der therthe: they hearde the crye that his men made, the whiche Hernyer made to be slayne. Than began Rey∣nawde to sai to his brethern. Lordes let vs go succour our folke, for and they should thus dye: it were to vs a great blame. Syr sayd hys bretherne goe in goddes name whan it please you, and whan they were come out of the pitte: the batayle began to be there ful terryble, for ye should haue seen Reynawde &amp; his brethern gyue there great strokes and manye. For Reynawde smote so merueyllouse strokes wyth hys swerd Flamberge the whyche did cut al that he rought. For Reynawde was all wrothe, and for great angre he habandoned and Ieoparded both lyfe and gooddes.</P>
<P>And therefore he bare greate hurte and harme to hys enemyes, For he had cast hys Sheelde ouer hys backe, and helde his swerde Flam∣berge wyth both his handes &amp; made
<PB REF="31"/> so great destruccion of the folke of Charlemaine: that the place was al full of bloud. And whan Reynawde saw that theyr enemyes were sore a∣basshed, and that they durste not a∣byde him: he sayd to his brethern. It was to vs great cowardnes to hyde vs so. Syr sayd Alarde ye say trou∣the. Than sayd Reynawde. My Lor∣des my brethern let vs to doo well. For traitours ben good to ouercom they shall not now endure longe a∣gaynst vs. And whan he had sayde these wordes: he came to y<SUP>t</SUP> gate of y<SUP>e</SUP> castel, and the fyre was a lytle quen∣ched, and maugre al his enemyes he shee the gate of that doungeon, and had vp the draw bridge of the sayde castel. And whā he had doone this: he came agayne to the batayle, &amp; found his brethern that slewe and beate downe so many knyghtes, and bare themselfe so worthelye: that it was maruayle for to see. For they smote no stroke, but they slew a man.</P>
<P>THan was Hernyer the tray∣tour in the medle within the doungeon, whereof Reynawde had locked the gate, and drawen the brid¦ge, and the good Reynawde saw that he was safe of the hoste of Charle∣mayne, and began to put hymselfe in the medle so sharpely that he dyd so muche he and hys brethern: that of y<SUP>e</SUP> folke of Charlemayne that we∣re wythin the doūgeon abode of thē aliue but Hernier and .xii. other, and whan Reynawde saw that they we∣re all dead: he and hys bretherne and hys folke tooke Hernyer and the .xii other. And than Reynawde did doo make agybet vpon one of the hygh∣est towres, and there he made to be hanged the .xii. men. And made Her∣nier to be bound his foure membres that is to wyt, feete and handes to foure horse tayles. And so he was drawen all quicke and quartered in foure peeces, as a traytour ought to be doone vnto. And whan Hernier was dead: Reynawde dyd make a great fyre, and made hym to be cast therein, and as he was al together brent: he made the asshes of hym to be cast in the ayre to the wynde.</P>
<P>¶ And heere ye may see how the tray¦tours that wolde betraye Reynawde were dead and slayne. For they were punysshed as they had deserued.</P>
<P>THan whan king Charlemayne wyst that his folke were thus dead, and y<SUP>t</SUP> he should not haue Reynawde nor his brethern: he was sore angry therfore, and sayd to him selfe. Ha good God lorde how am I euyll dealed wythall by this foure knyghtes bretherne, I dyd my selfe great harme, whan euer I made thē knyghtes. And it is often sayd, that men make often a rod for them self. And that I may well nowe take to me. For theyr vncle slewe my sonne Lohyer, and Reynawde my neuewe Berthelot that I loued so deerelye, and yet nowe he hath hanged my men and many of them slayne. Well I myght call my selfe vnhappye, whan I that am the moste puyssaūt of the worlde, cannot auenge me of the foure symple knyghtes. I shall
<PB N="xxvi" REF="31"/> neuer departe from hens till that I be auenged, or els they shal ouercom¦me, and all mine armye. Syr sayde Folques of Morillō ye haue a good cause why, and Reynawde is a foole that he fereth you not. For if he had doubted you: he should not haue han¦ged your men, but he hath doone so in dispyte of you. Thā sayd y<SUP>e</SUP> Duke Naymes of banyer, had ye beleued me: ye should not haue lost your men ye wolde beleue Hernier, it is hap∣ped of it as ye see. Now beholde your folke y<SUP>e</SUP> ben shaking with the winde.</P>
<P>ANd whan thēperour Char∣lemayne vnderstoode this y<SUP>t</SUP> the duke Naymes sayde to hym: He knew that he sayd trouth, and wyste not what he should say to it, but loo∣ked downe all ashamed. This han∣ging: Reynawde &amp; hys brethern are gone vpon the walles, and looked a∣boute them and sawe that the base courte of the castell brenned there as their vitailes were. Then began rey¦nawde to say to his bretherne, fayre lordes the thinge goeth well, syth y<SUP>t</SUP> we ben scape thanked be god from so perillous and harde auenture. It lacked lytle but that we were al dead by false treason, but the worste that I see: is that we haue loste our store of vitayles so that we haue nothing to liue vpon, and me semeth that yf we dwell anye lenger heere within: we doone not wysely. But yf it seme you good, it is tyme that we departe hence. Brother said Alarde, ye speke well and wysely, and we shall doo as ye haue sayde. For as longe as the lyfe is in our bodyes: wee shall not leue you. Whan y<SUP>e</SUP> foure brethern were together accorded for to depart thens: they trussed al theyr harneys, and taryed tyl that it was night, and than they armed themself, &amp; lyghted on horsebacke, And whan they were redy: Reynawde sayde to them, Lor∣des how many men ben we? We ben answered Alard well .v. hundred, It is ynough sayd Reynawde. But wot ye what we shal doo? let vs keep ourselfes alwayes together without makynge of anye affraye and so goe thorough the lande of Almayne, and yf the folke of Charlemayne hap to assayle vs: thynke to defende ourself well and smyte harde vpon them so that we haue to our worship the bet∣ter of them, whan it was tyme to li∣ght on horsebacke: Reynawde moū∣ted vpon Gayarde, and the other al∣so lyghted vpon theyr horses. And whan they were all horsed: they ope∣ned the gate, and wente out at theyr leyser wythout makynge any noyse. And whan they were all yssued out: Reynawde behelde and saw the cas∣tell y<SUP>e</SUP> brente, wherof he tooke greate pitie, and sayd. Ha god good castel it is great domage that ye be thus dis∣troied and wasted, goddes curse haue he that betrayed this good castel. It is a goe seuen yere that ye were made fyrste. Alas we haue had there in so muche good and so mykyl worshyp: and nowe we leue you mawgre vs. Certes ye were my truste after my brethern. And whan I muste leese you: there is none so sory for it as I am. And as he spake these wordes: the teres fell downe from his eyen,
<PB REF="32"/> and he was so taken with greate he∣uynes that almoste he fell downe in a swoune so muche of sorowe he had in his herte.</P>
<P>ANd whan Alarde sawe Rey∣nawde so full of sorowe: he came to hym and sayd. By my fayth brother ye be to blame to say so, ye be not the man that shall come to mis∣chief. For all the knightes that ben a lyue are not worthe you, and there∣fore I pray you that ye wyll confort yourselfe, for I swere you vpon all halowes that afore two yere be pas∣sed: ye shall haue a Castell that shall be worthe suche foure as this is, but now let vs put our selfe to the waye for we haue no need to tari. Brother sayd Reynawde I haue founde euer in you good counsell. Now goe we than our way, and take you &amp; Guy∣charde the forewarde, and I and Ry∣charde shall come behinde. Syr sayd Alarde all shall be doone as ye saye. And than tooke Alarde his brother Guycharde with him and wente a∣fore with a. C. knightes with them and had forthe theyr caryage in the myddes of theim. And Reynawde &amp; Rycharde came after with the resy∣due of theyr folke, but they could ne∣uer make nor passe so softli, but that the folke of the hoste of y<SUP>e</SUP> emperoure ouertooke them.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of two groups of knights in armour on horseback charging each other, with heads and body parts on the ground</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>THan whan Charlemayne kne¦we we that Reynawde came: he was muche wrothe, &amp; made his cō∣maūdemente that euery man should be armed, &amp; than the hoste began to moue and went incontinent and armed themselfe. whan Alarde and Guycharde that wente afore sawe that they myght not passe, but that they must medle: they spurred their horses &amp; ranne vpon Charlemayns folke so sharpely that they were all an angred with it, for thei ouerthrew two knightes to the grounde and in continent was there greate a doo.</P>
<P>And whan Reynawde sawe that the hoste moued: he called to hym twen∣ty knyghtes and bad them take and lede foorthe the caryage afore out
<PB N="xxvii" REF="32"/> of the hoste, &amp; he should go helpe hys bretherne, syr sayd they we shall doo your commaundemente. And than Reynawde spurred Bayarde and en¦tred amonge y<SUP>e</SUP> thickest, and began there to make so great meruayles of armes that all the folke of Charle∣maine wondred vpon, for he and his bretherne ouerthrew there dead so many knightes that none durst com afore them, but he was slayne.</P>
<P>¶ What shall I tell you? wyt it that the folke of king Charlemayne was so discōfited for bicause that it was nyght, and myght not well see what nombre of folke the foure bretherne were, that Reynawde and hys com∣pany passed mawgre them of y<SUP>e</SUP> hoste And also I tel you for certayne that Reynawde and hys brethern dyd so great harme to the folke of Charle∣mayne: that he was sory for it mani dayes after. whan Reynawde was passed: he foūd his sommers and his caryage, and his Knightes that con¦duyte them, wherof he was glad.</P>
<P>Thā he sayde to his brethern. Syrs go on your waye, and they dyd hys commaundement, and Reynawde wyth his brother Rycharde abode behynde, and whan Charlemayne wyste that Reynawde went a way: he was glad by cause he had left the Castell of Mountaynforde, and in∣continent he made hym to be folo∣wed, and also the hoste was redelye armed, and whan they were well a∣rayed: they tooke theyr way after the foure sonnes of Aymon.</P>
<P>NOw ben the foure knyghtes bretherne ryght sory of that they haue thus left theyr fayre castel of Mountaynforde, and wit it that Charlemayne folowed them well of nyghe, and sayd that it should hurt him sore, but yf he might take them. But Reynawde the worthy knyght is not abasshed, but he taketh all his folke and setteth them afore hym, &amp; sayde to hys brother Alarde, Good brother Alarde, take kepe of thys folke betwene you and Guicharde, and yf the folke of Charlemayne as∣sayle vs: we shal defēd vs wel. Syr sayd Alarde as ye haue sayd: so shall it be doone. And than they saw come Charlemayne and Ogyer the Dane the duke Naymes of bauiere, Foul∣ques of Moryllon, and many other and whan Charlemayne that came afore well horsed saw Reynawde &amp; his folke: he cryed to them and sayde So helpe me god glotons ye be now dead, this is the day y<SUP>t</SUP> I shall make you all foure to be all hanged. Syr answered Reynawde it shall not be so as ye wene, and it please God, for yf god gyue me lyfe and health, and to my horse Bayarde, the pursucte shall sore dere be bought y<SUP>t</SUP> ye nowe doo. And whan he had sayd the same he turned Bayarde agaynst Charle∣mayne for to smite him. For he wēde well to haue slayne him wythout a∣ny faute. The kynge Charlemayne was in daunger to dye yf Reynawde had raught hym, but Dampe hughe wente betwene the kynge and Rey∣nawde that came with hys spere in y<SUP>e</SUP> rest wylling for to doo great harme And at this coming: he smote Dam∣pe hughe thorough the sheelde so har¦de that he perced his herte wyth the
<PB REF="33"/> Iron of his spere, and so he fell downe dead afore the kynge. And whan Reynawde had gyuen that stroke he wente hys waye after hys brethern.</P>
<P>WHan Charlemaine saw hughe fall dead: he cryed w<SUP>t</SUP> an highe voyce: Now after lordes after, for if these glotons scape vs: I shal neuer be mery, &amp; Reynawde came agayne to hys folke and sayd to thē. Lordes doubt you not as longe as I am a lyue, but be al assured and so ryde on hardly and in good araye. ¶ What shall I tell you more? Wyt it y<SUP>t</SUP> .xxiiii myle lasted the chase, and there was neuer a myle: but that they iusted to¦gether, &amp; many knightes were there ouerthrowē &amp; slayn. But Reynawde and his folke bare themself so māly that they lost, but three of theyr fe∣lawship at that tyme, but they rode so longe tyll that they came to the ri∣uer. The kynge called to him his ba¦rons and sayd to them: Lordes let a loue the chase, it were foly from hēs forth on for to folow them, for I see in al our horses may no more let thē goe to a hundred thousand deuyls, for yf Reynawde wrought with wit∣ch craft he could doo no more, thā he doth. Let vs thinke for to lodge vs heere nyghe y<SUP>e</SUP> ryuer. For the coūtrey is good and pleasaūnt as me semeth Syr sayd the barons, let it be doone as ye haue commaūded. Than they vnladed theyr sommers, and pyght there their pauyllions. And whan they were set vp: the king made him to be dysarmed. And in the meane whyle the supper was made redye lyghtlye, for all the daye the king had nother eatē nor drōkē, nor none of hys felowshyp. And Reynawde was passed ouer the riuer he and his bretherne, and his folke safe &amp; soūd where as they wolde be by the grace of our Lorde, and whan Reynawde and his brethern saw that the chase was ceassed and left: they went all softly, and whan they had gone ferre from the oste of king Charlemayne: they found a fountayne fayre and cleare, and aboute that fountayne was muche fayre grasse and thicke. Whā Reynawde saw y<SUP>e</SUP> place was so pleasaūt: he sayd to hys folke. Heere is a fayre ground for to lodge vs &amp; for our hor{is}, Sir said Alarde, ye say trouth. And thā they vnladed theyr sōmers and theyr cartes, and wyt it the horse were wery, but the poore knyghtes were euyl lodged, for they had there no meate nor drynke but cleare water. But wyt it that Rey∣nawde nor none of his knightes dis∣armed them not, but made good wat¦che all the nyght one after another. And whan they saw the daye come: Reynawde made hys harneys to be trussed, and they lyghted horse∣backe, and tooke theyr way through the great forest of Ardeyne, and whā they had riden longe they lyghted do¦wne afore another fountayne that they that had watched the nyght a∣fore should rest themselfe there.</P>
<P>NOw myght well say Charle∣mayne y<SUP>t</SUP> he can neuer hurte the foure sonnes of Aymon. And
<PB N="xxviii" REF="33"/> wit that he was lodged vpon the ri∣uer where he abode, whan he wolde no more folow after Reynawde, and whan the day was clere: he sayde to the duke Naymes. What thynke ye what we ought to doo? Syr sayd the duke Naymes yf ye wyll beleue me: wee shall tourne backe agayne. For to goe any ferther this waye: it were but a foly, for thys wood is to thick and the riuer ouer muche perillous &amp; also Reynawde &amp; his brethern are suche knyghtes that they be not for to belyghtly ouerthrowen, &amp; while the king and the duke spake together there came many knyghtes to hym, and whan Charlemayne saw them: he called Vydelon, Reynier, Ogier y<SUP>e</SUP> dane and sayd to them. Lordes I will that ye come agayne to parys wyth me. And whan they vnderstode this: they were glad and sayd to the King, Sir it is the beste counsell that ye cā doo, and after that thei were so accor∣ded: Charlemayne made to be cryed that euery mā should returne agayn into his countrey, &amp; that they should kepe it well, &amp; that he prayed theym so to doo. Syr sayd the barons wee shall doo your commaudement, and whan all was sayde: they made the hoste to descende &amp; take theyr way, &amp; the king went streyght to paris and the barons in theyr countryes, and whan Charlemayne was come to Paris: he called afore him his barōs &amp; to them sayd, fayre lordes I am y<SUP>e</SUP> moste vnhappy kyng of the worlde, whan I haue no power to auenge my selfe of the foure sonnes of Ay∣mon, and they led me as ye know. I wene they shall returne into theyr countrie or to theyr castell, and it be so: I wyll y<SUP>t</SUP> we go there agayne for to ley syege there. Syr sayd the duke Naymes, that shal they not doo, for they are in Ardeyne, And ye knowe y<SUP>t</SUP> the forest is so great that they shall fynde some cheuysaūce. That might wel be sayd the kyng Charlemayne. But where some euer they go: euell way myght they fynde. And whan he had sayd this: he tourned toward Ogyer, and sayd to him. Take Ge∣rarde, Foulques the Almayne, and Dron of Moudidier, and gyue leaue to the frenche men and to the other. Syr sayd Ogyer well shal be doone your commaundement. And then wēt Ogier to Foulques, to Gerard and vnto Dron, and tolde them that y<SUP>t</SUP> Charlemayne had commaunded. And after came to the frenche men, &amp; tolde to the other knyghtes, &amp; gaue them leue. And whan the kynges folke haue had leue: eueri man went to his countrey, not the right waye: But trauersynge the mountaynes. And thus as Aymon went trauer∣synge the lande towarde hys coun∣trie: It happed to him so that he came by the fountayne where hys sonnes dwelled. Whan Aymon saw hys chyldren: he was abasshed and ryght sory for it. And then he sayd to his barons. Lordes counsell me I praye you what I ought to doo a∣gaynst mi childrē. For and I assayle them, and that they ben slayne or ta∣ken: I shall neuer haue Ioye. And I I let them goe: I shalbe forsworne to Charlemayne. Whan his barons hearde him speake so: there was ne∣uer one that answered anye worde.
<PB REF="34"/> And whā Aymon sawe that he was counselled of no man: he sayd agayn to them. Syth it is so that ye wyll gyue me no counsell: I shall doo af∣ter myne owne wyll. For god forbid y<SUP>t</SUP> it be layde to me, that I haue foūd thē heere. And haue not fought with them. But well I tell you that it is for my synne that I haue founde them here. But frō hens forth it shal be doone therin as it pleaseth God &amp; fortune. Syr sayd Esmenfraye yf ye assayle your children ye doo not a∣mysse for ye sware it to the kynge Charlemayne, kepe syr Aimon y<SUP>t</SUP> ye be not forsworne. For a man of your age should rather dye than he should doo any treason. Good freend ye say well sayd Aymon, and I shall so doe that I shal not be blamed, and than he called two of his knightes, and sayd to them. Go towarde Reinawde and his brethern and defye them in my behalfe. Syr sayd the knightes it is a harde thinge for to be doone, but sythe it please you: we shall doo as ye haue commaunded, &amp; than thei wente towarde Reynawde that was sore abasshed, for he knew well that they were of his fathers folke, wher∣of he was full sory for it. And after he sayd vnto his bretherne. Lordes now arme your selfe. For a man y<SUP>t</SUP> is well garnysshed is not of lyghte ouerthrowen, and of the other syde I know so muche the hardynes of my father: that he shall not feyne to be fyght vs. Brother sayd Richarde ye saw trouthe. Thys hangyng: ca∣me the two knightes afore him, and whan Reynawde sawe them come nyghe hym: he went agaynst them &amp; said to them. Lordes what be ye? and what winde driueth you hyther? thā spake one of the knyghtes, &amp; sayd to Reynawde. Syr we ben knyghtes of my lorde your father that sendeth to you by vs a defiaunce. Lordes sayd Reynawde I wyste it well as soone as I dyd see you of ferre. But go a∣gayne &amp; tel to our father that it wyll please hym to gyue vs trewce for he shall not doo wel for to be fight vs y<SUP>t</SUP> are his naturall childrē. Syr said the knight of the folye ye speake, but thinke to defende your selues well, for he shall assayle you w<SUP>t</SUP>out doubt.</P>
<P>ANd whan they had sayd these wordes: hey retourned a∣gayne for to reherse to Aymon theyr message, &amp; how they had defyed hys children. Whan the olde Aymon vn∣derstode them: he made none other tarying but spurred his horse with the spurres, and ranne the formaste vpon hys sōne. And whan Reynaw¦de sawe his father come: he came a∣gainst him and said. Ha father what doo you? we haue none so great a foe as ye be to vs, and I haue great mer∣uayle that ye come alwayes vpon vs, ye doo yll &amp; great sinne for to doo so. At the least yf ye wyll by no wyse helpe vs: be not to vs contrary ne e∣nemy yf it please you. Thou theefe said Aymon, ye shal neuer doo good syth that ye begyn to preche. Goe to the wood so shall ye become wylde beastes, euyll day giue you god. For ye ben not worth an handfull of straw Now thynke to defende your selfe.</P>
<P>For yf ye ben taken: ye shal be put to a great tourmente. Syr sayde Rey∣nawde
<PB N="xxix" REF="34"/> ye doo vs wronge. I shal de∣fende me syth that I mai none other wyse doo. For yf I sholde let mi selfe to be slaine: mi soule should be put to paine and tourmente. Whan Aymon saw that: he brought his spere in the rest, and put himself among his chil¦dren, lyke as they had ben straūgers And whan Reynawde saw that: he cryed to hys men, and sayd, heere is none other but doo wel now. Lordes thīke to smite wel, for need cōpelleth vs therto. And whan he had sayd y<SUP>e</SUP> worde: he spurred his horse with his spurres, and put hymself in the thic∣kest. And began to make so great ef∣fortes of armes, that all the folke of his father meruayled of it greatlye. ¶ What shall I say? the batayle be∣gan so fell and so cruell: that pytie it was to see. For ye should haue sene gyue and receyue great and horrible strokes of the one parte, and of the o∣ther, and many knightes and horses dye, many sheeldes broken and mani white harneys broken. So manye heades smittes of and so many leg∣ges and armes brokē and sore hurt. And thinke that this batayle was sore stronge and well holden of the one syde and of the other. But to say the trouth: Reynawde must lose at y<SUP>t</SUP> tyme. For hys Father had three ty∣mes as many folke as he had. For of fyue hundred mē that abode with Reynawde after his castel was take which were with him at this bataile: were left on lyue, what hurt &amp; sound but fyfty persones. But I tell you well for verye certayne that Rey∣nawde &amp; his bretherne dyd so great harme to the folke of theyr father: that they slew well halfe of the men that he had. But at y<SUP>e</SUP> last Reynawde must lose and flee away towarde the mountaynes, and Aymon chased hym as well as he could, for he wēd well for to haue taken theym. and whan Reinawde saw them self vpon the toppe of the mountayne: he sayde vnto his brethern. Let vs not depar¦te frō hence. For this is a good place for to defende. Wyt that there was great scarmysshīg and iustyng made and many a knyght dead and verye sore wounded. And there was slayne vnder Alarde his good horse. And whan that Alarde sawe himselfe a ground: he lept vpon his feete ryght quickli. And tooke his swerde in his hande and began for to defende well his bones. And whan that Rychard sawe his brother Alarde a foote: he turned towarde him for to helpe &amp; succour hym, and Aymon and his folke came there for to take him.</P>
<P>So began the batayle yet agayne more cruel then it had be afore. And wyt that Alarde should haue ben ta∣ken there, yf it had not be the noble and worthy knyght Renawde that came for to helpe him. And whan that he was come there: he smote Bayarde wyth hys Spurres, and wente into the greatest pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se. So that he ouerthrew the Duke Aymon his father doune vnto the grounde, and after he sayd vnto hym. Father ye haue pledged my brother Alarde For ye be now set a foote as he is.</P>
<P>Than was Aymon very sore angry that he loste almost his wittes. And
<PB REF="35"/> Reynawde set his hand to his swerde and began for to departe the prese in suche a wise that he brought hys bro¦ther Alarde out of the prese, and af∣ter sayd to hym. Fayre brother lepe behinde me vpon Bayarde. For to abyde here any lenger: it were folye. Whā Alarde vnderstode his brother Reynawde: he was ryght glad for he was so wery y<SUP>t</SUP> he myght no more and so he mounted vpon Bayarde behynde his brother Reynawde. And whan Bayarde wyste him self lade wyth two knyghtes: he strengthed hymself so strongly: that it semed to Reynawde that he was more Ioy∣ouse and more mery than he had be of al the daye. Now wit it that Rey∣nawde made foure Ioustes vpō his horse Bayarde with hys brother A∣larde behinde hym. Whereof he slewe foure knightes of the folke of Char¦lemayne that were come with hys father Aymon. And all thus Rey∣nawde tooke Alarde out of hys ene¦myes handes Mawgre theyr teeth &amp; bare hymself right worthely y<SUP>e</SUP> same day, as here after ye shal mow more playnly vnderstande.</P>
<P>NOw ben the foure sonnes of Aymon recreaunt &amp; almoste wery, but only Renawde that neuer was the weker for nothing that he dyd in armes. For as he went: he tur¦ned himselfe at euerye passe that he made, and rebuked and kept his ene∣myes a backe with his harde strokes that he gaue to them, so that his fol∣ke wente afore hym all at theyr ease and leyser. And whan he sawe that his folke were wel ferre from their enemyes: he spurred Bayarde and came to his folke (his brother Alarde behinde hym) as lightly as bayarde had be without anye brydell and no sadle vpon him. For this horse was suche that he was neuer werye, and thus as Reynawde went away: than cam &amp; folowed after him Esmenfray y<SUP>t</SUP> was one of the moste worthy kny∣ghtes of Charlemayne &amp; was vpon a horse right good and blacke, that Charlemayne had geuen to hym.</P>
<P>And whan he was nighe Reynawde he cried to them. So helpe me God glottons ye ben dead or taken sureli I shal brynge you to Charlemayne. And anon wēt and smote Reynawde in his sheelde, wherof Reynawde was muche angry, and Reynawde smote him agayne in suche a wyse and wyth so great a strength: y<SUP>t</SUP> ney∣ther for his sheelde nor for his good armures of steele he was not kepte, but that Reynawde ouerthrew hym sterke dead to the grounde. And whā this knight was dead: Reynawde tooke his horse by y<SUP>e</SUP> bridell and sayd to Alard his brother holde fayre bro∣ther, light vpon this Blacke Horse whiche is good. For I gyue him to you.</P>
<P>ANd whan that Alarde sawe the fayre present that his bro∣ther Reynawde had doone to hym: he was as glad of the same, as thou¦ghe he had wonne Parys. And thā he made none other rarienge: but y<SUP>t</SUP> he lighted downe from Bayard and mounted vpon Esmenfrays blacke horse that his brother had giuē hym &amp; smote him with the spurres &amp; went
<PB N="xxvii" REF="35"/> and Iusted agaynst a knyght of his fathers folke that was called anfrai so harde that he ouerthrew him dead to therthe. And shortly to speake af∣ter that Alarde was in this wise set agayne on horse backe: began the ba∣tayle of a freshe sore hard and fell, in so muche that at that houre were slayne .xx. of the best knyghtes that Aymon had with him. Whan Aymō saw this: he was sore angry for it, &amp; cryed to hys folke. Halordes yf they scape you I shal neuer haue ioy, for they haue slayne Esmenfray y<SUP>e</SUP> good knyght that king Charlemayne had gyuen to me. Whan the folke of Ay∣mon vnderstode these wordes, &amp; the wyll theyr Lorde: than they dyd ren vpon Alarde so much that thei made hym to leue the place by force, and if it had not be the passage of a lytle ri∣uer that eased and holye them great¦ly: Reinawde and hys brethern had muche to doo, but I tell you with∣out faute that Reynawde and hys brethern made so great occisyon of that folke of theyr father: that it was pitie for to beholde, for there dyed well of them .xxv. at the passage of the ryuer and yf Reynawde had had wyth him a fyfty knightes more thē he had at y<SUP>e</SUP> passage: he should haue dyscomfyted his father and all hys folke but for faute of mē: Reynawde must for sake the place and myght not saue with hym but .xiiii. knygh∣tes of hys owne. Nowe see how so∣rowfull was the batayle, for of fyue hundred knyghtes that Reynawde had with hym there abode wyth him alyue but .xiii. and ye maye well wit that the olde Aymon had domma∣ged his children right sore, but that they passed ouer the Riuer, for as it is sayde they had loste all theyr men wherof they were full sorye and wrothe.</P>
<P>¶ Now hath Reynawde so fewe fol¦ke that he wot nomore what to doo, but he might not doo therto, wherof the teres fell downe continually frō his eyen, and in lykewyse wept Ay∣mon hys father at the other syde as the historye dooth tell, and whan he had wept ynough: he sayd in this maner. Ha fayre Sonne pane and worthye howe sorye am I? for I am the occasyon of your harme and domage, now shall ye all goe as exi∣led, for ye haue nought to lyue vpon &amp; I cannot helpe you by anye wyse, wherof I ensure you I am greatlye displeased and sory for it. The deuil take his soule that fyrst begā y<SUP>t</SUP> strife &amp; so shal he. Whan he had made hys mone and lamētacions longe ynou∣ghe: he made incōtinent all the dead bodyes to be taken for to be buryed.</P>
<P>And they that were hurte: he made to be brought wyth hym as well as he coulde, And made the bodi of Es∣menfray to be put vpon a litter, and tooke on his way towarde Ardeyne where he bode but a night, and in y<SUP>e</SUP> mornyng he made the litter to be bor¦ne vpon two horses &amp; went agayne to Paris and came afore Charle∣mayne and sayd to hym. Syr whan I went now last towarde my coun∣trey, wyt that as I was on my way, I founde my children, and fyue hun∣dred knyghtes wyth them in the fo∣rest of Ardeyne, &amp; for thacquitaunce of myn othe: I dyd send to them mi
<PB REF="36"/> diffiaunce, &amp; wolde haue taken them for to haue brought them to you as prisoners, but I myght not, for they bē sore doubted. And y<SUP>t</SUP> I assailed thē it hath cost me sore dere, for they haue borne vnto me so great harme and domage that it can not be estemed, and I slew al theyr folke excepte .xii persones that ben scaped with them but they haue slayn your knyght Es∣menfray, but at the last they went a¦way discomfited and ouerthrowen. And they should haue ben taken yf it had not be a ryuer that they passed o∣uer, wherby they were saued. Whan Charlemayne vnderstode these wor∣des: he was ryght sore an angred, so muche y<SUP>t</SUP> he loste almost his wytte. And than he sayd to olde Aymon in angre, by God Aymō ye excuse your selfe falsly, for neuer Rauen eate his yonge byrdes, to a nother ye shall make thys to beleue but not to me. Whan y<SUP>u</SUP> olde Aymon vnderstode the kynge that he spake thus: he sayd to hym. Syr Emperour wit that I doo tell you is trouth, and I doo shewe it to the ende that my trouthe be kno¦wē, &amp; for none other cause, doo bring afore me your reliques and halowes that I shall swere vpon the sayntes that ben in heauen, that it was as I haue recountred &amp; sayd to you, and yf it please you ye shall beleue me, &amp; yf ye wyll not: ye may chuse therof. Aymon sayd Charlemayne I know well your herte, for yf it went all at your wil, your sonnes should be lor∣des of all Fraūce, and of all my em∣pyre. Syr sayd Aymon ye be wrothe of some other thynge, wherof I may not doo therto, &amp; yf ye haue any kni∣ght in your courte y<SUP>e</SUP> wyl make good this that it please you for to saye: I shall proue it on hym wyth my body that he lyeth falsely. But euermore ye haue be such that ye neuer loued a true knyght, but flateres and liers wherof mani euilles ben happed and shall happe. And than Aymon came downe from the Palays, and lygh∣ted vpon hys horse and went agayn to his countrey without any leaue that he tooke of the kynge, &amp; he rode so longe a day after another that he came to Ardeine, and there he found the Duchesse his wyfe, that came a∣gaynst hym, and receyued hym with a glad chere, and asked hym howe he had doone.</P>
<P>THan sayde the duke Aymon, ful euyll haue I doone. For I foūd my foure sonnes in the wood of Ardeyne, &amp; so I assayled them cru¦elly wenyng to me for to haue takē them, whiche I coulde not doo, but I stewe &amp; discomfited all theyr folke, &amp; they haue doone me so great harme of my folke, and so many they haue slayne of them: that I know not the nombre. And I tell you for very cer∣tayne, but yf it had ben the prowes &amp; great worthynes of our sonne Rey∣nawde: I had taken Alarde, for my men had slayne his horse, and had brought hym so lowe that he myght no more goe, but Reynawde his bro∣ther came vpon vs and brake vs so sore that he brought Alarde out of y<SUP>e</SUP> prese, mawgre vs and oure folke, &amp; made hym syt behinde hym vpon Bayarde. And I tell you that Rey∣nawde fought so sore that neuer lion

And thus they went from vs wolde we or not And I wente agayne to Parys to Charlemayne, and shewed to hym how the thynge was come, and how Esmenfray was slayne, wherof I trowed not to haue had blame, but he b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amed me ryght greatlye for it, but sixh y<SUP>t</SUP> he is my heauy lorde with out a lawfull cause: I shall make hī wrothe and sory afore syx monethes come at an ende.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N this party the tale sayth, y<SUP>t</SUP> after that Reynawde had slayne Esmenfray and giuē his horse to his brother A∣larde: they passed ouer the ryuer and went into the forest of Ardeyn sore deep in it, by cause they wolde not be aperceyued. And whan they had ben there a lytle whyle: they begā to keep the wayes, &amp; all they that came for by them and that bare any vytayles they were distressed by them and ther of they liued, for they durste not goe to no towne nor to no Castelles for to bye anye vytaylles, and there∣fore they suffred great need &amp; greate dysease, for they had nother meate nor drynke, but water. For the most parte they eate flesshe without anye breade. And knowe that for cause of thys great suffraūce y<SUP>t</SUP> they endured thus, &amp; also of the great colde y<SUP>t</SUP> they had, for by cause of the snowes that were there: theyr folke began to dy. And abode nomo liue but Reynawd and his brethern. And thys was be∣cause of the great strength that was in theyr bodies. For no trauayle mi∣ght not hinder them. And wit y<SUP>t</SUP> they had but eche of them foure an horse that is to wit Bayarde and the thre other, but they haue nother Otes nor other Corne for to gyue theym, but they eat only such as they might fynde in the forest of rootes and lea∣ues. And for this cause: theyr horses were so leane that with peyne might they stande, saue Bayarde that was fatte and in good plight, for he could better feede and lyue w<SUP>t</SUP> rootes, than

And wyt it well that the foure sonnes of Aymon lyued there this life so longe that euery man that passed there as they were and kepte theim selfe, escaped not, but he was other slayne or distressed of suche vy∣cailles as he had, so that all the coun∣trie aboute them was sore wasted by theim that it was meruaille.

For nigh there as Reinawd haūted: was no man that durst abide there, but onely within the fortresses. For whan Reynawd was mounted vpō Bayarde, and his three brethern vp∣on their other three horses: all their rychesse and power was with them, and yet they wasted and destroyed all the countrie all about theim. And so the foure poore knightes were so sore disfigured, that who someuer had seene them, should not haue knowen them.

<P>ANd whan Reynawde sawe himselfe so porely arayed: he called to him his brethern and sayde, Lordes I meruayle my selfe muche that we take not some good counsell what we haue to doo, and me semeth that we ben become yl, &amp; that slouthe is amonge vs. For yf we were such as I crowed: We shoulde not suffre the martirdome that we endure and that we haue endured so longe a goe, no we know I that we ben but lytel worth to haue let reste oure enemyes as we haue. But one thing I consi∣der, we haue but fewe horses &amp; litell harneis, &amp; no money at a land yet we ben in such a plight that we ben more like beastes th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n folke. So praye I you all in generall that ye wil tell me what we ought to doo for the best, for I tel you for very certaine that I had muche leuer die as a knight than for to die heere for hungre &amp; for dysease.</P>
<P>ANd whan Alarde hearde Rey∣nawde speake thus: he sayde, brother so helpe me god. It is longe sith I dyd take heede to that ye saye now, but I feared me full sore to telle you therof lest ye wolde haue be dys∣pleased with me for it, but sith that ye haue opened the wordes, yf ye wyll beleue me: I shal gyue you good coū∣seyl as we semeth. Sir we haue suf∣fred heere great pouertie a longe time &amp; we may not goe into no coūrtie but we shall be take, for as ye knowe all the barons of fraunce, &amp; namely oure father, &amp; al our kinnesmen hateth vs deadlye, and if ye will beleue me: we shal goe streight to A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eine towarde

And whan we shall haue soiourned: we shal take with vs some company and shall goe serue some great lorde, where we shall get some good, for ye be not such a man but that ye shal yet ones haue great plenti of goodes, for I know no man in erthe that of wor∣thynes &amp; of strength maye compare to you. Brother said Reynawde ye saye well and wysely, and I promyt you I shal doo so. Whā the two other knightes hearde the couseil y<SUP>t</SUP> Alarde their brother had gyue to Reinawde: they began to saye. Brother Alarde we know wel that ye gyue good coū∣seyll to our brother Reinawd. Than sayd Reynawd. Sith that this coū∣seyll semeth to you good: we shall doo it to nighte, so muche abode the foure sonnes of Aymon that the nyghte ca∣me, and whan it was come: they ligh∣ted on horsebacke and put theimselfe to the way so well clothed and araied as I haue tolde you aboue and in su∣che wise that their flesh was seen na∣ked in manye places of their bodies. And so longe they rode by nyght and by daye that they came there as they were borne that was nigh the citie of Ardeyn, and whan they were so nigh the citie that they myghte well see it: they looked vpon it, and they remem∣bred the greate ryches wherfro thei were cast and banysshed, and of the greate pouertye that they had suffred longe. And as they aproched nyghe the cytye. Reynawde sayde to hys brethern we haue doone euyl that we haue not taken suretie of oure father, for ye knowe well that he is so cruell that yf he may take vs: he shal yeelde vs prisoners to Charlemain. Brother saide Rychard, ye saye well but my herte gyueth me not that oure father wolde doo as ye haue said, and he so dyd: yet haue I leuer die afore Ardeyne: than for greate dysease and hungre in the forest, let vs ryde sure∣ly, for I telle you that no bodye shall know vs. And of thother parte if we can set oure feet within Ardeyne: we shal be safe ynough, for we be wel be∣loued, and my laid our mother should neuer suffre that men shoulde doo to vs any harme ne dyspleasure.</P>
<P>CErtes fayre brother saide Rey∣nawde, ye haue sayde tyght wel and wisely, and much ye haue recom∣fort me. Nowe let vs ryde in a good houre. And whan he had sayd these wordes: they entred soone after with in Ardeyne, and they tode thorough the maystres streate that they were not knowen of no bodye, &amp; they went streyght to the castel without any ta∣ryinge. And wyt that whan they pas∣sed thoroughe the stretes: the folke that behelde them, merueylled muche of them, for they wyste not what fol∣ke they were, and sayd the one to the other, see what folke ben these. I trowe that they ben not of oure lawe nor of our beleue. Than they asked theym, what ben ye lordes that are so countrefaite, are ye Paynemes, or of what countrey ben ye? Syrs answe∣red Reynawde ye enquere ouer much see ye not what folke we been. And whan they were come to the palays they lyghted downe a foote, and too∣ke their horses to keep to their kni∣ghtes
<PB N="cxxxlii" REF="38"/> that were come of late in their felawship, and thā the foure brethern wente vp to the halle, and met with no body. For the olde Aymon theyr father was a hawkyng vpon the ri∣uer, &amp; the duchesse their mother was in her chambre, where she was con∣tynually pencyful and sory bycause y<SUP>t</SUP> she might not heare no tidinges of her childrē. Whan y<SUP>u</SUP> foure brethern were entred wythin the haile: they foūde no man to whom they should speake, wherof they were sore mer∣uayled and they set themself downe, the one heere, and the other there, &amp; abode th{us} a longe whyle that no bo∣dy came there. And whan they had caried longe ynoughe: than came the duchesse theyr mother out of her chambre, and she looked a longe the hall, where she saw her sonnes thus counterfayte whiche she knew not but meruayled herself greatly what folke they were. And whan Alarde sawe hys lady mother come, he said to his brother Reynawde and to his other brethern, yōder is our mother that we sore desyred for to see, let vs goe agaynst her yf it please you, and tell her our great penurye and oure need. Brother sayd Reynawde wee shall doo so, but we shall tary tyl she speake to vs or not, and thus taried the foure brethern tyl that theyr mo¦ther was come to them. And whan she sawe them so blacke &amp; so hidous, &amp; principally Reynawde y<SUP>t</SUP> was so great &amp; so rough: she tooke so greate feare of them that she wolde haue gone agayn into her chambre, but a∣non she assured herselfe &amp; said to thē, God saue you Lordes. What be you or of what nacyon? are ye christen or paynimes, or folke y<SUP>t</SUP> dooth penaūre wyll yee not haue some almesse or some clothyng for to couer your bo∣di with? for I see ye haue great need of it, and yf ye wyll haue it for god∣des sake I shall giue it you gladlye, to thende he haue mercy on my chyl∣dren, and that he wyl keep them frō ylle combraunce and fro peril, for it is wel seuen yeres that I did not see them. And whan the Duchesse had sayd this: she tooke so great pytie to remembre her children that she begā to weepe sore tenderlye. And whan she had wept a longe while: she sayd so hygh that her chyldren vnderstode it. Ha good god whan shall the daye come that I shall see my chyldren? Alas good lorde how fayne wolde I see them. Was there euer Ladye that bare so riche a bourden as I haue, and that were of it so discomforted as I am?</P>
<P>ANd whan Reynawde sawe his lady mother so sorowful &amp; sory: he had of it great pitie, and the teres began to come at his eyen, &amp; wolde dyscouer himselfe. But whā the duchesse behelde well his visage and his behauour, and maner: her bloud ranne vp to her face, and he∣uered within her body, and began to shake full fast, so that almost she fel downe in a swoune to the erth and was a great whyle that she myght not speake her hert was so close and so sore pressed, &amp; all her coloure lost and gone, and whan she was come agayne to her selfe: she dyd caste her syght agayne vpon Reynawde, and
<PB REF="39"/> knew him ryght well by a wounde that he had in his face, whiche was doone to hym of a fall, whan he was in his tender age. Thā she said to hī as glad as ani mother may be, Reynnawde my sonne, whose peere is not among al the knightes of the worlde. Howe see I you so sore ap∣payred and chaunged? Where is gon your great beaultie? why my sonne doo ye hide you towarde me, y<SUP>t</SUP> loued you more than my selfe? And while that she said these wordes: she looked aboute her, and knew her children, &amp; anon she went towarde them wyth her armes spred abrode, for to coile and kisse theym sore weepynge for great pitie that they were so sore a∣payred of theyr beaultie, and so long she kissed one and than another: that at last she fell downe in a swoune. And Reynawde tooke her vp in his armes, wher she abode a good while and Reynawde &amp; his brethern ceas∣sed not from weeping, for great pitie that they had of theyr mother.</P>
<P>ANd whan the duchesse was come agayne to herselfe: she tooke her children &amp; made them sitte downe by her, and sayd to them how is it that I see you thus poore &amp; dys∣fygured? why is it that ye haue with you no knightes nor none other cō∣pany? where haue ye ben that haue endured so great pouertie, and so great disease? whan y<SUP>e</SUP> duchesse spake thus to her chyldren she dyd weepe styll sore tenderly, and foundred all in teres, holdynge her sonne Rey∣nawd betwene her armes, and kissed hym sweetly. Lady sayd Reynawde we haue with vs but three knigh∣tes that keep our horses yōder with∣out. For our father hath slayne all our knightes, &amp; all our folke. And also he should haue slayne vs yf it had not be our lorde y<SUP>t</SUP> kept vs ther∣fro through his pitie &amp; mercy. Sore hard parentage dyd he shewe to vs our naturall father. Whan the Du∣chesse vnderstoode these wordes: she was ryght sory for it. And called to her one of her seruauntes and saide to hym. Goe and make my sonnes horses to be had into a good stable, and that they ben well tended. And brynge hither y<SUP>t</SUP> three knightes, that keep the horses without, for I wyl see them. Madame sayde her squyer it shal be doone incontinent. And then he went to the three knyghtes and sayd to them, that the duchesse wolde see them. Whyche incontinent dyd as the ladye had commaunded, and came to the Palays where as Reynawde taryed for them. Lordes said the duchesse to them, ye be right welcome. Madame sayd the knigh∣tes God gyue you good life &amp; longe and Ioye of your children, For they ben the best and the moste worthye knyghtes of all the worlde. Thys hangyng: came there a yeman, that sayd to the duchesse. Madame, yf it please you to sit at y<SUP>e</SUP> table: y<SUP>e</SUP> meat is redy. Thā the lady tooke Reynawde and the other with her, &amp; lede them to dinner and made them syt downe all afore her, and theyr three knygh∣tes
<PB N="xxxiiii" REF="39"/> at the left side of her. There ma∣de good chere the foure sonnes of Ai∣mon, and ete at theyr case &amp; at theyr owne wyll. For it was longe syth y<SUP>t</SUP> they had ony good mele, where they myghte take theyr naturall food at theyr ease. And as they were at the table: Thenne came theyr father Ai∣mon from hawkynge and huntynge whiche had taken foure hartes and two wylde bores, and dyuerse per∣tryches and Fesauntes. Whan Ay∣mon sawe them: he knewe them not and he sayd vnto the duchesse. Lady what are these folke that ben thus coūtrefer? whan the duchesse vnder∣stode her husbande she was sore a gaste, and began for to weepe and sayde. Syr these ben your chyldren and myne, that ye haue trauaylled so moche, and sore hunted as wylde beastes. The which haue dwelled lōge tyme in the foreste of Ardeyne where as they haue ben sore tourned as ye now maye see. Now are they come vnto me by cause I am ryghte glad whan I see theym. For to you they ben not come. For they knowe well that ye loue them not, But I praye you for god that for the loue of me ye wyll lodge them this night. For they shall departe to morow erlye, &amp; I wot not yf euere I shall see them. Wherefore of this I beseeche you right humbly,</P>
<P>Than whan Aymon vnderstode these wordes: he shooke al for anger, and tourned hym selfe toward his sonnes, and made to them euill there and said to them, Glotōs god∣des curse haue you, For ye ben not worthe a strawe. For ye haue nother folke nor money, nor no prisoner y<SUP>t</SUP> might pay to you a great hauoyre. Father sayd Reynawde by the fayth that I owe to you, if your lande is in peace, the other ben not so. For ye might goe sixe score miles that ye should not finde nother riche man nor poore, but that they keepe them selues within fortresses and in Ca∣stelles. But ye doo great wronge for to doo vs the worst that ye can, ye tooke fyrst from vs our good Ca∣stell of Mountaynforde. And after y<SUP>t</SUP> ye had assayled vs in y<SUP>e</SUP> wood of ar∣deyne, and slew all our folke so that of fyue hūdred knyghtes that I had ye left a lyue with me but enleuyn, whereof .viii. ben dead, and these .iii. that ye see heere ar abyde a liue, now beholde well father, and thynke how ye bare your selfe towarde vs. But syth it is thus that ye ought to vs no good wyll, and that ye may not see vs: Make vs the heades to be smy∣ten of, and so shall you be beloued of Charlemayne, and hated of god, and of all men.</P>
<P>ANd whan y<SUP>e</SUP> olde Aymon vn∣derstode Reynawde th{us} speke he knewe well he sayde trouth, and began to fyght sore at his herte, and then he sayd to hys chyldren. Mys∣chaunt your lidernes, &amp; slouth hath ouercome you. Ye were neuer my childerne: For yf ye were such as mē wene: ye should not haue suffred the great pouertie that ye haue endured so longe. But ye should haue gone win vpō your enemies, for to main∣tein your self honestly, &amp; make good
<PB REF="40"/> warre to Charlemayne through all hys lande. But ye are become mys∣chaunt, &amp; therfore I tell you that ye get nothyng of me. Now thē voyde out soone of my Palayce, and goe begge where ye wil at a nother place Syr sayd Reynawde ye say that an euyll and an vnkynde father ought to saye. For I tell you for very cer∣tayne that we haue slayne so manye theues and brygauntes: that I can not numbre them, wherof I fele my selfe in great synne. But for god we requyre you that ye wyll helpe vs to recouer our lādes of Charlemayn and yf ye wyll not doo so: gyue to vs of your godes, and we shall goe ferre from you. I wyll not sayd Ay∣mon. Father sayd Reynawde here I se well your euyll wyll. I and my brethern haue doone so muche, y<SUP>t</SUP> we ben comen into your place, that we should fare the better for it, but I see wel ye wyll cast vs therfro w<SUP>t</SUP> great afraye. And I swere to you by the fayth that I owe to my Lady mo∣ther that yf I muste nedes departe from you in suche a maner: ye shall abye it full deere, yf ye caste vs thus out of your lande, for I haue leuer die here by you, thā to die for hūgre. Sith that it may be none otherwise.</P>
<P>THan whan Reynawde fawe that his father was so hard herted against him and his brethern: he wexed red for angre, and began to chau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge colour, &amp; drewe hys swerde halfe out of his shethe. And w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an Alarde saw hys brother Reynawde chaūge colour: he knewe well that he was wrothe, so ranne he &amp; called hym sayenge. Ha fayre brother, for goddes loue angre not your selfe so sore to our father for he is our lorde and therfore whether it is right or wronge he may say to vs as it plea∣seth hym, and we ought to doo hys commaundement. And if he is cruel towarde vs: we ought to be humbly &amp; pleasaunt towarde hym. So keep your selfe for goddes loue that ye set not hande vpon him. For it were agaynst the commaūdement of god brother sayd Renawde it lacketh but lytle that I wexe mad al quicke whā I see afore me him that should helpe vs, defende &amp; loue vs as his childrē &amp; gyue vs his good counsell to vs, and towarde all men: And he dooth all contrary the same. He hath made peace wyth Charlemayne for to dys∣troye and vndoo vs. I saw neuer so cruel a man agaynst his sonnes, for he chaseth vs a waye from him full shamfulli, as though we were straū∣gers or sarasyns. I should not can tell the harme &amp; great hurte that he hath doone to vs, nor the greate po∣uerti that we haue suffred for hym. I wolde neuer haue doone so to him for rather I wolde haue let me ben flayne all quycke. But &amp; yf I cā euer go from hens: I certifie you that I shall angre him, and shal so wast his lande that it shall doo him but lytle profite so that it shall be spoken of perpetually.</P>
<P>ANd whan Aymon herad Rey¦nawde speake thus: his herte wexed softe, &amp; began to weepe ful sore &amp; sayd. Ha god how I am sory y<SUP>t</SUP> I may not enioy the good y<SUP>t</SUP> god hath
<PB N="xxxv" REF="40"/> gyuen to me largely, there should be no man in the worlde so happy as I were, yt my children had theyr peace with kinge Charlemayne. For I am sure that the kinge Priamus of troy had neuer better m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n to his children nor more valyaūr ne pru, thā I haue Ha euyll hert thou shouldest not ta∣ke heed to none other agaist thy chil∣dren, but shouldest help them &amp; keep thē against al mē, wherfore I ought wel to hate thee: euyll hert thou hast made me hate y<SUP>t</SUP> I ought to loue as myne owne selfe, &amp; whan he had thus spoken to hym selfe: he sayd to Rey∣nawde. Fayre sonne ye are right wor¦thy &amp; sage: for neuer Hector of Troy was worth you, nor in al the world is not founde your matche. And ther¦fore I ought well to doo your wyll. Whan the duke Aymō had sayd this worde: he spake to his wyfe the du∣chesse &amp; sayd, lady I go yonder with out, for I wyll not be forsworne a∣gaynst the kynge Charlemayne: ye haue wythin golde &amp; siluer ynough, &amp; many horses &amp; muche harnes, pal∣frayes &amp; sommers. Now giue to my chyldren all that they wyl take. And whan he sayd thus: he tooke hys mē with him, &amp; went his waye.</P>
<P>THan sayd Reynawde we ou∣ghte to tanke you muche of that ye haue now sayd, and we shall go hence to morow erly with goddes grace: to the ende y<SUP>u</SUP> ye be not euyll at ease, and if it please you we shall a∣byde for this night for to comforte our mother, y<SUP>t</SUP> hath be so yll at ease for the loue of vs. And I promyt you father we should not haue comē yet, but it had be for her sake, Rey∣nawde fayre sonne sayd y<SUP>e</SUP> duke ye are full of great witte. Wit that whan Berthelot was dead I durst not she∣we me afore the king Charlemayne: bycause he sayde he had leuer haue loste the halfe of his Realme, &amp; thre∣tened me for to hange or brenne and distroye all my lande, and I dyd so muche by the counsell of my freen∣des that I made mine apoyntment and that I was out of al blame. And ye haue not considered the othes y<SUP>t</SUP> Charlemayne made me doo against you, as agaynst all other y<SUP>t</SUP> helde w<SUP>t</SUP> you, and I am sore dyspleased of y<SUP>t</SUP> I foūd you in y<SUP>u</SUP> woodes of Ardeyne as I did. But I was forced of mine honour to doo as I dyd for to be in peace with kyng Charlemayne, your mother hath not forsworne you, and therfore she may giue you of our goo¦des at your will. And whan y<SUP>e</SUP> duke had sayd these wordes: he yssued out of his palays, &amp; went to the woode.</P>
<P>AFter whan the free duchesse heard that, that the duke Ay∣mon gaue her leue for to doo w<SUP>t</SUP> hys goodes at her wyll: she called her children and sayde to theym. Fayre children now be you sure that sythe your father is not within ye shal be well tended vpon, and shall haue al the chere that I can doo to you. And thā she did doo make y<SUP>e</SUP> baynes redy &amp; made them all to bayne honestly, &amp; wyt y<SUP>t</SUP> in theyr vayne were manye a swete herbe, &amp; whan they were well clene: the good lady made bring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en and other clothes for to chaūge, and to eche of them a mantel of fine

For it mistre∣th me well, and thā he tooke of that treasoure at his wyll. And inconty∣nent he sent messangers through al the countrey for to get hym souldy∣ours of the best men of warre, wher∣of many one came gladly to him, the which reynawde payed for an whole yere. What shall I tell you more? Reynawde and his brethern lay that nyght within the Castel of their said father. And the next mornynge after or it was day they departed and had with them fyue hundred men well horsed and well arayed. And whan Reynawde &amp; his brethern had take leue of theyr lady mother y<SUP>e</SUP> duchesse she sayd to them fayre sonnes I wil that ye drawe towarde Spayne, for it is a plentious countrey. And as they wolde haue departed: than cam Mawgys theyr cosyn, that came out of Fraunce, where he had ben longe tyme,</P>
<P>AFter whan Mawgys was lighted from hys horse: he rā to Reinawde, his armes spred abro∣de, &amp; began to kisse him, &amp; whan he had so done: he kissed his other three brethern, &amp; than he sayd to them. Ha fayre cosyns I am ryght glad to see you, &amp; thanked be our Lorde that he hath brought me into this coste. Co∣syn sayd Reynawde where haue you ben so longe y<SUP>t</SUP> we had neuer tydyn∣ges of you. Cosyn sayd Mawgys I come from the great Citie of Paris where I haue stolen three horses la∣den with golde, &amp; here they ben, the whiche Charlemayne wende for to haue hid well, &amp; I gyue you the half of it for I might not bestowe thē bet∣ter than to you. Cosin sayd Reynaw∣de god thanke you. And whā he had sayd: so he went out of Ardeyne with his bretherne &amp; his folke, &amp; foūd his father y<SUP>t</SUP> came fro the wood, &amp; whan Reynawde saw his father: he made hym reuerence &amp; bowed hymselfe to hym, &amp; Aymon sayde to them, fayre sonnes no when ye well garnysshed &amp; honestly arayed. I praye you that ye doo so in Fraūce, that men speke of your prowes, &amp; ye my other chyl∣dren. I commaūde you that ye obey Reynawde and keep hym aboue all thing, for as longe as he shal lyue ye ought not to be aferde of no harme.</P>
<P>THan sayd Alarde, syr we shal doo your cōmaūdement, and we pray you for gods loue, y<SUP>t</SUP> ye will be euermore our good father. I wyll be so my children sayd Aymon, &amp; thā Reynawde tooke leue of his father &amp; of his mother y<SUP>t</SUP> conueyed them out of the towne. But the good lady fel downe in a swoune whā she saw de∣parte her children. And all the towne began to make such a sorowe that it was great pirie, and Reynawde and his bretherne went on theyr waye. And whā y<SUP>e</SUP> duchesse came to her self and saw her children departe: She began to say. Ha poore herte myne, why breakest not thou, alas if I had

Alas I se my ryche burden go to exile, and yet I cannot witholde them nor helpe them that they abyde with me, thus as the Duchesse made her moue to her women: Aymon came and tooke her betwene hys armes and recom∣forted her and sayd vnto her. Ladye dyscomfort not yourself so muche, for my hert giueth me that we shall yet see them in great prosperiti and honour and great Ioy and gladnes ye shall once haue of them in shorte tyme. Shortlye to speake: the good Aymon recomforted so muche the Duchesse that she lefte her sorow &amp; went agayne to the palays with the duke Aymon.

Cosin sayd Reynawde let vs than go there syn that it semeth to you good, and whā they were here to accorded they tooke theyr waye towarde Gascoyn and rode so longe by their iourneys that they came to Burdews a fayre citi, where they foūd king Yon with a great company of knyghtes, and whan they were downe from theyr horses: Reynawde sayd to his folke, go we lodge vs. Cosyn sayde Maw∣gys we shall not doo so, but we shall speake streight with king Yon, &amp; yf he reteyneth vs: in a good houre be it &amp; yf he not doo so: we shal serue bor∣goyns t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e sarasyn, whiche is ryght prue &amp; sage, &amp; hath al redy cōquested almoste all the lande of kynge Yon, as Tholouse, Montpeller, Lietary &amp; saynt Gyle, Tarascon, &amp; Arles, &amp; yf we fayle heere: we shall not fayle there. Cosyn sayd Reynawde ye spe∣ke well and wysely, &amp; we shall doo as ye haue sayd. And thā Reynawde tooke with him. L. knyghtes &amp; hys three brethern &amp; Mawgis, and tooke of his armes and clothed hymselfe honestly and rychelye, and whan he was well arayed: he went to y<SUP>e</SUP> king Yons court vpon a litle nagge, and whan he rode thorough Bordews: all the people ran for to see him, by∣cause he was so great &amp; so wel made and so fayre with all, and also hys three brethern, but they were not al euin so great. And whan they were come to the gate of the kinges place Reynawde light on foote, &amp; went vp to y<SUP>e</SUP> Palays, and founde y<SUP>e</SUP> king at y<SUP>e</SUP> counsell. And whan the stewarde saw Reynawde so fayre a man and so goodly, and so many folke wyth hym: he came him agaynste and sayd to hym. My lorde ye be right welcō. And Reynawde answered to him god giue you good auenture Nowe tel and please you where is y<SUP>e</SUP> kyng? My lorde sayd the stewarde, the king holdeth now his coūsell, for Bour∣gons the sarasin is entred in his lād and hath doone to hym great harme and dommage. For he hath brente townes and castelles abbeyes, hos∣pytalles, Churches, and al other mo∣nasteries, and nowe he is parforce within Tholouse with a great puis∣saunce. Certes sayde Reynawde. This Borgons is of great power as me semeth and after that menne
<PB N="xxxii" REF="42"/> sayen. Thus as Reinawd &amp; the stu∣ard spake togither: came king yō out of the coūseil chambre, &amp; whan Rey∣nawd saw him: he tooke his brethern &amp; his cosin mawgis with him &amp; went ayenst the king, which Reynawd sa∣lued right humbly &amp; said to him. Sir I am come to you fro a ferre londe w<SUP>t</SUP> me three brethern &amp; my cosyn that ye see heere for to doo you seruise &amp; oure folke if it please you, &amp; we shal serue you in such a maner, y<SUP>t</SUP> we will haue nothing of you, but &amp; our seruise be a∣greable vnto you: ye shal promise me as a king if it be your pleasure, that ye shal be my warraunt &amp; help ayenst al other, good freend said y<SUP>e</SUP> king yon ye be righte welcome to me, &amp; where ye saye ye be come for to serue me: I thanke you for it with al my hert, but I wil first know what folke ye ben, for ye might be such that I should de∣fende you, or that I shoulde be youre enmy. Syr said Reinawd sith that it please you to know what we ben: I shall telle it to you, wyt that my na∣me is Reynawd &amp; am sonne eldest to the duke Aimon of Ardeyn, and these three knightes ben my brethern, hee∣re is Alard, Guichard, &amp; Richarde, &amp; heere is Mawgis our cosyn one of y<SUP>e</SUP> best knightes of the world &amp; most wi∣se. Charlemayne hath cast vs oute of Fraunce, &amp; hath disheryted vs, &amp; our father hath disauowed vs for the lo∣ue of him &amp; for this cause sir we goe seeke a bout after a lorde that is good and true that shoulde helpe vs to de∣fende ayenst Charlemayne, and we shall serue him wel and truely.</P>
<P>WHan king yon hearde this that Reynawde sayde: he was right gladde of it that they were the foure sonnes of Aymon the best knyghtes of all the worlde and most doubted, &amp; Mawgis that was the moste subtyll of the worlde that were come for to serue him, he wolde not haue ben so glad yf men had gyuen to him al pa∣rys. For he wyst well that yf euer he shoulde fynishe his warre: it shoulde be by their meane. Than he looked vp toward heauen, and thanked our lorde of the comyng of these worthye knyghtes, &amp; than he sayde to them. Lordes ye are reteyned of me for ye ben not the men that ought to be refu¦sed. I promyt you truely and in feith of a kinge, that I shall defende you with all my power ayenst all men, ye are dysheryted &amp; I also, therfore it is well reason that we be togyther, and that the one helpe the other of all his power. Sir said Reinawd we thanke you a thousande tymes &amp; I promyse you that we shall die in youre seruise or elles your londe shall be recouered again. The king called his stuarde &amp; sayde to him and commaunded that Reinawd &amp; his felawshyp should be well lodged. Incontinent the stuarde tooke Reynawd by the hande, &amp; ful∣fylled the commaundemente of the kyng. Now are the foure sonnes of Aymon acqueynted with the kinge yon of Gascoyn, whiche went to ha∣ue doo wel but he repented him soone after. ¶ But here we leaue to speake of king yon, and of the foure sonnes of Aymon: &amp; return to speake of bour∣goyns that were at Tholouse, the which he had take by force of armes.</P>

</FIGURE></P>
<P>IN this party sheweth the hys∣torye that after bourgons had taken tholouse: he made a great par∣lyamente to his folke. And sayde to them. Lordes ye knowe well, that whan the yron is well hot: it wer∣keth the better. This worde I haue sayde afore youre lordshyppes for to gyue you to knowe what we oughte to doo. And therfore me semeth that we ought to ryde now towarde bour∣dewes while the corne is in the ere. For our horses shal haue meat ynou∣ghe, sir saide his folke, ye speake wel and wisely, let it be doone as ye haue deuised, &amp; whan the morowe came: Bourgons departed oute of Tho∣louse with well .xx. thousand knygh∣tes wel armed, and ceassed not for to ryde tyll that they came afore Bour∣dews in .ix. daies. And he set all hys folke in a bushement within a greate woode that was nygh, &amp; abode there with theym, excepte foure hundred men that wente to the cytie w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sting and brennynge all the countrie vnto the citie of Bourdews, and whan the daye watche that was vpon the gate of the citie sawe the sarasins come: he cried with an highe voyce, arme you knightes for heere ben the Pay∣nymes that come for to hurte you.
<PB N="xxxii" REF="43"/> whan the Citie vnderstode this: she began to before moued.</P>
<P>THan whan Reynawde sawe that it was tyme to take hys harneys on: he sayd to hys brethern Goe make you all redye, and make our trompettes to be blowen that al our folke put them self in armes. In contynent made hys brethern his cō¦maundement. And whan they were al armed: Reynawde mounted vpon Bayarde, and came to kinge You &amp; sayd to hym. Syr be not abasshed of nothynge: but be sure that god helpe vs thys daye. My self, my brethern and all our folke we goe afore, and make your folke to be redi incōtinet for my hert giueth me that this cur∣sed Sarasyn shalbe thys day dyscō∣fited, and ouercomē wyth the helpe of god. Freende sayd the king, god be wyth you, and I shal doo that ye t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l me. And thus Reynawde went out of Bordews the formest of all hys folke agaynste the Sarasyns vpon hys horse Bayarde, the sheeld at his necke, and his swerde in hys hande and ranne fiersly vpon hys enemies and incontynent smote a Paynym throughe his sheelde so that he ouer¦threw him dead to the grounde, and forth wyth he cast a mother, god wot he helde well his swerde, for he hew the Sarasyns as they had ben with∣out Harneys. And shortly to speake after that Reynawde and hys folke were assembled: the Paynymes mi∣ght not endure. For Reynawde and his brethern slewe them as beastes, so that they must nedes flee toward theyr busshement. And whan bour∣gons saw hys folke c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me thus: he yssued out of the wood wyth hys company, and made bussynes &amp; hor∣nes to be blowen, &amp; came for to suc∣coure his men. And whan Reinawde saw so great numbre of folke com∣ing out of y<SUP>e</SUP> wood: he was sore mer∣uayled, and turned hym self towarde his bretherne and sayd to them. Lor∣des keep that ye be not dismayed, for we shall get a great worshyp thys daye, and I praye you that euery mā parforce hymselfe to doo well, bro∣ther sayd Rycharde we shall neuer be dysmayed as longe as ye be vpon Bayarde. Brother sayd Reynawde doo as good men, for yf ye wyll par∣force your selfe a lytle: These Pay∣nems shal not holde afore vs. Thus as Reinawde spake to his bretherne they sawe Bourgōs come the spere in his rest and smote a man of Rey∣nawde by such a strength that he sho∣ued his spere through and throughe his body, so that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll downe dead to the earth. Whan Alarde saw that: he was wrothe, &amp; sparred his horse and ranne vpon a Paynym so harde that he felled hym sterke dead afore hym. And shortly to speke there was neuer seene suche a distresse of folke, as Reynawde, his brethern &amp; maw∣gys hys cosyn made wyth so fewe folke as they were agaynst Bour∣gons the Sarasyn.</P>
<P>THan whan the king you that came to the succours of Rey∣nawde saw y<SUP>e</SUP> great faytes of armes that he and his bretherne made, and how hardlye they dyd set vpon and ouerthrew all that they recountred
<PB REF="44"/> afore them the blessed hymself of the meruayle that he had of theym. And than he sayd to hys folke, go we suc∣cour these worthy knyghtes, for it is tyme longe a go, and whan the king You had sayd these wordes: he spur¦red his horse &amp; put hymself amonge the thickest &amp; began to doo wel, and dyd so moche that he brake the great preses, and came where Reynawde was. And whan Reynawde saw the kynge Yon he sayd to hym. Syr be sure and certayne that the Sarasins are discomfited, than sayd the kyng. Reynawde I am well assured y<SUP>t</SUP> god shall do me grace through your high prowesse, blessed be the houre that ye were borne, &amp; came into these mar∣ches. To speake shortly the batayles were assembled of one parte and of the other, but whan Borgons sawe the great harme that Reynawde bare to hym of his folke: he sayde to hys men, we ben ouercomen by the pro∣wesse of these fyue knyghtes. Let vs go backe agayne, for it is tyme. And whan he had sayde these wordes: he and his folke begā to flee. And whā Reynawde saw Borgons that fled: he smote Bayarde with the spurres and ranne after him and said to him self that Borgōs should abide there or els it should coste hym his lyfe.</P>
<P>Wythin a shorte whyle Reynawde was ferre from hys brethern, &amp; ferre from his felawship so that they wist not whiche way he drewe. Whan y<SUP>t</SUP> Alarde saw that, he wyst not where Reynawde was drawen: he sayd to hymselfe. Ha god whiche way is my brother drawen to y<SUP>t</SUP> I am not wyth hym? &amp; than came there kyng Yon y<SUP>t</SUP> sayd to them. Lordes and knyghtes wel ye know (gramercy God) that it is not wysdome for to chase ouermo¦che his enemies for often tymes co∣meth there a great dommage, let vs withdraw vs I pray you, syr sayd A¦larde what say ye? we haue lost Rey¦nawde our brother &amp; wot not where he is, nor yf he is dead or taken, whā kyng Yon vnderstode this worde: he was full sory and wrothe, and they wente and sought amonge the dead men that lay vpon the feelde. And whan Alarde sawe he coulde not be found: he made great sorowe wyth Guycharde, Richarde and Mawgis also. And whan y<SUP>e</SUP> folke of Reynawde saw that he was not found: they be∣gan to make so great sorowe that it was pitie for to see.</P>
<P>ALas sayd Alarde what shal I doo? I departed fro my lande poore &amp; exyled, but I dyd not care for it, for I wente with the best knyght of the worlde and trowed by the pro∣wesse of hym to haue recouered ho∣nour and hauoyre my selfe &amp; my bre∣therne, &amp; now I haue lost him tho∣rough my defaute. Alas my chaūce what shal we doo fro hens forthou? for y<SUP>e</SUP> erth shal not mow susteyne vs no more. But that it shal foūdre vn∣der our fete, &amp; whan the kynge Yon saw the great sorow that the poore knightes made for theyr brother: he sayde to them. Lordes and knightes what is this that ye doo? sith y<SUP>t</SUP> he is not dead it ought to suffyse you, for yf he be take ye shal haue him agayne &amp; it should cost me al y<SUP>t</SUP> I haue in the worlde. And also we haue so mani of
<PB N="xxxix" REF="44"/> them prysoners, that Borgons shal not doo to hym no harme for nothīg Syr sayd Alarde let vs go after for goddes sake, let vs wyt where he is become. Freende sayde the kyng I wil doo so gladly. And thā they spur¦red theyr horses and went as fast as theyr horses might renne, &amp; wit y<SUP>t</SUP> A∣larde Guycharde Richarde &amp; Maw¦gys rode a good pase so moche that it semed that the erthe should haue clouen a sondre vnder them.</P>
<P>¶ No <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owill I tel you of Reynawde that went after Borgons so fast as yf the tempest had chased hym, and he was gone so ferre in a short while y<SUP>t</SUP> it is wōder for to hear tel, for there was no beast that went afore Bay∣arde his horse. And whan Reynawde had ouertaken Bargons he cryed vpon him as hye as he myght doo.</P>
<P>Certes Borgons thy horse may no more I see it well, and therfore flee no ferther, but turne thy self towarde me, for yf thou dyed flyeng: y<SUP>u</SUP> shoul∣dest be shamed. whā Borgons heard Reynawde speake thus to hym, he returned incontinente, and whan he saw Reynawde: he knew well that it was the good knyght that had dyscomfyted al his folke and sayd to hym. Syr knyght, go backe agayne and marre not your horse aboute nought, for it ye lese him: ye shal ne∣uer recouer suche a nother, and this he said for to abasshe the good knight Reynawde, for he durste not Ioust with him bicause of the great pro∣wes that he had seen in him but Rei∣nawde was not the man that should be made aferde, wyth wordes and than Reynawd sayde agayne to him Borgons this worde nedeth not to you for to say: for ye must nedes de∣fende your selfe. And than he spur∣red incontynent bayarde, and whan Borgons saw that he myght not be delyuered of Reynawde but by Iu∣styng: he spurred his horse and ranne vpon Reynawde as harde as he mi∣ght, &amp; smote Reynawde so sharply y<SUP>t</SUP> the spere wente in peces. Reynawde fell not, but smote Borgons suche a stroke that he ouerthrew both horse and man to the grounde and woun∣ded borgons in his brest full sore.</P>
<P>And whan Borgon saw hymselfe at the grounde: he rose vp lyghtlye and tooke hys swerde in hys hande, and caste his sheelde vpon his head. And whan Reynawde perceiued y<SUP>e</SUP> stroke that he had giuen hym in hys breast: he cryed to hym and sayd. Certes it shal not be reproched to me that ye fyght wyth me a fote and I on horse backe, and with this he lighted down fro bayarde &amp; drew out his swerde &amp; went against Borgons, &amp; Borgōs agaynst hym, &amp; there began a sharpe batayle and whan the horse of the paynē felt him selfe fro his mayster: he begā to rēne away ouer y<SUP>e</SUP> feeldes and whan Bayard sawe him renne away, he went after and ouertooke hym soone ynough, and thā he tooke hym by the mane with his teeth and drew hym with so great myght that he brought him agayne to hys may∣ster in the same place where the two worthy knyghtes fought to gether, and Reynawde gaue a stroke to bor∣gons with his swerde vpō his shelde and all that the sworde roughte he cut through to the fleshe, and well
<PB REF="45"/> an hundred mayles of his flancar∣des and made hym a great wounde into the haunce.</P>
<P>THan whā borgons the sara∣syn saw that wonderful strē∣gthe of Reynawde, &amp; the great stro∣kes that he gaue to him: he was sore afrayed and fered least he should die, and so he withdrew himselfe a backe and sayd to Reynawde. Ha gentyll knyght I pray thee for the loue that thou hast to thy God that thou giue me truce, and I shall make the lorde &amp; syre of all y<SUP>e</SUP> I haue in this worlde. Certes sayd Reynawde I wyll not doo so, for I haue promysed to kyng Yon that I shall helpe hym agaynst all men, and he in lykewyse hath pro¦mysed me, but and yf ye wyll make your selfe christen: I shal doo it glad∣ly. Syr sayd Borgons I wyll yelde me to you, for to no better knyght than ye be I cannot yelde my selfe, if ye wyll saue my lyfe and my mem∣bres. Borgons said Reynawde yf ye wyll yelde you to me ye shall haue no more harme thā I shall, wyll ye promise me thys said Borgons? yea said Reynawde. Now hold my swerd sayd Borgons &amp; I put my self al to¦gether in your hand. And Reynawde tooke hys swerde and assured hym that he should not dye and they two went together for to take theyr hor∣ses, and whan they had theym they lyghted vpon, and tooke theyr way towarde Bordews, and as they cam againe: they met with king Yon that came and hys folke renning agaynst hym as fast as they myght. Whan Reynawde saw y<SUP>e</SUP> kyng: he thanked hym muche that he was comyng af∣ter hym, and presented to hym Bor∣gons that he had thus taken and cō∣quested as I haue rehersed to you, &amp; sayd to him. Noble king of Gascoyn I beseche you that Borgons haue no harme, for I haue assured hym. Good freend sayd king yon, no more he shall, but all honour for the loue of you, and I praye to God that I may doo nothynge that is agaynst your wyll. And whan Alarde Guy∣charde, Rycharde, &amp; Mawgys saw Reynawde that brought Borgons prisoner: they were neuer so glad, for they wend to haue lost hym, so ranne they and kyssed hym ful sweetly and made hym great feast and great ho∣nour. For they had ben in great so∣row for the loue of hym.</P>
<P>BRother sayd Alarde into a great sorow and heuines ye had brou∣ght vs this day, for we wende that ye had betake, but sith that ye haue taken Borgons the warre is doone and blessed be the houre that ye were borne &amp; the pappes that ye sucked, and whan they were wel feasted: they tooke on theyr way towarde Bor∣dews, where they led Borgons as a prisoner. And whan the kynge yon was at Bordews: he lighted downe and tooke with him Reynawde and his brethern by the hande &amp; Maw∣gys also &amp; went vp to the palays, &amp; foūde his folke that made great feast and he called them to hym and sayd Lordes bere honour and worshyp more to this knyght than to me, for I am king of Gascoyn by theyr wor∣thynes
<PB N="xl" REF="45"/> and great prowes. For if thei had not ben I had ben dead and ouer throwen, blessed be that good lorde y<SUP>t</SUP> dyd put in theyr myndes for to come into this coste, for they haue quyted my land &amp; haue set all my realme in peace. To speake shortlye the kynge made the buty to be dealed. Wherof the moste party he made to be gyuen to Reynawde &amp; hys bretherne. And Reynawde wolde take nothyng of it but gaue it all to his folke, and whā the kynge saw the great largenes of Reynawde: he loued hym more than he did afore, and than he sayd that he wolde make Reynawde lorde ouer hym, and of all his lande.</P>
<P>THe kyng yon had a syster the whych was a right fayre da∣moysell. Whan she hearde speake so moch good by Reynawde: she called to her a knyght that was called wa∣ter, and sayd to hym, tell me by your fayth who hath the pryce of the ba∣tayle. Madame sayde water I shall tell it you with a good wyll. Nowe wyt y<SUP>t</SUP> Reynawde is the best knyght of all hys brethern &amp; of al the world for he tooke Borgons the sarasyn by force, wherby he hath brought the warre at an ende, whā the pucell vn∣derstode this worde: she was ryght glad &amp; dyd thanke our lorde for it w<SUP>t</SUP> al her hert. And y<SUP>e</SUP> king &amp; his knigh∣tes ceassed not to make ioye for the victory y<SUP>e</SUP> god had sent to them tho∣rouh y<SUP>e</SUP> great pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esse of the valiaūt Reynawde. Whan borgons saw him selfe in pryson: he sent worde to kīg Yon y<SUP>t</SUP> he should come speake wyth hym. And as soone y<SUP>e</SUP> king Yon wyst of it he went to hym. And whan bor∣gons saw him, he salued hym &amp; after sayd to hym. Syr I am your pryso∣ner &amp; also y<SUP>e</SUP> moste party of my folke yf it please you ye shal put me to raū¦sone and my men also, &amp; I shal gyue you .x. horses laden wyth golde for me &amp; for my folke. Borgons said the kynge I shall doo wyth a good wil, yf Reynawde counsel me so and no otherwyse I wyll not doo, and thā the kyng Yon sent for Reynawde &amp; for his bretherne and all hys other barons. And whan they were come he helde his counsell howe he should doo for the delyuerance of borgons, Reynawde &amp; his barons counselled the kyng that he should put borgons to raūson, &amp; whā the kinge saw y<SUP>t</SUP> his barons counselled hym the same: he made borgons to be called, and made his delyueraūce to be sygnyfyed vn∣to hym. And thus was borgons de∣lyuered and went with his folke in∣to his countrey, &amp; yelded Tholouse agayne to kynge Yon &amp; sent to hym. x. sommers all laden with fyue golde as he had promysed to hym. And in∣contynent that the kynge Yon had receyued them: he gaue them to Rey∣nawde and to his brethern, but Rey¦nawde did as a worthy knyght. For not a penye he wolde take of it nor his bretherne also.</P>
<P>IT happed vpon a day y<SUP>e</SUP> Rey∣nawde &amp; his bretherne wente in a forest that was not ferre thens, &amp; toke foure wilde beastes, &amp; as they were comynge homwarde they foūd themself vpon the riuer of Gironde, &amp; as they wente, Alarde looked ouer the riuer and saw a hyghe mountain
<PB REF="46"/> and all hyghe on the toppe of it was a fayre roche. And whan Alarde saw so fayre a grounde and so stronge: he turned hymself towarde Reynawde and sayde to hym, Brother yonder vpon that hyghe Mountayne is a fayre grounde and a strong, I beleue that there hath be sometime a castel. And yf we myght doo so muche to buylde there a stronge place for our selfe: Charlemayne should neuer ta∣ke vs there. And ye wyll beleue me ye shal aske it of kyng Yon, and yf he gyueth it to you: let vs doo make there a stronge castell. Cosyn sayde Mawgys (to Reynawde) Alarde gi∣ueth you good counsell. And I pray you that ye wyll doo so as he hath sayd. Cosyn sayd Reynawde I shal doo it syth that ye counsell me so.</P>
<P>And whā they were accorded to the same, they entred into a barge and wente ouer Gyrounde, &amp; whan they came a lande: they ceassed neuer tyll that they came afore the kynge, and presented hym the beastes that they had taken. And whan the kynge saw them: he receyued them curtoysly, for he loued them moche. And than the kynge enbraced Reynawde in hys armes.</P>
<P>THe morowe nexte after that the kynge had hearde masse: Reynawde tooke the kynge &amp; drew him a lytle at a syde, and sayd to him Syr we haue serued you longe well and truly. Certes sayd the kynge ye say trouth, and therfore I am holde towarde you well for it, now looke yf I haue in al my lande cities tow∣nes or castelles, or other thyng that ye wyl haue, for ye shal haue it incō∣tinēt. Syr sayd Reynawde I thanke you muche of your good wyll. But heare my wordes yf it please you, say on hardly sayd the kynge. Syr sayd Reynawde I and my brethern were the other daye comyng fro the chase, and as we came alonge by the sydes of Gyronde and of Dordone and namely betwene these two ry∣uers: I saw a Mountayne sore hy∣ghe, and yf it please you I wolde well buylde thervpon a castell after my pleasure. Wherfore syr &amp; it please you ye shall graunte to me thys gift for al the seruyce that euer I dyd to you. Whan the king vnderstode this worde: he was ryght glad of it, and sayd to Reynawde I ryght gadlye graūt this to you. And with the same ye shall haue of me .x. thousand mar∣ke euery yere for to maynteyne your estate. Syr sayd Reynawde gramer∣cie, and cast hymself to his feete. And the kynge Yon tooke hym vp anon curtoysly and kyssed hym for greate loue and after he sayd vnto hym.</P>
<P>Noble knight I promise you I shal make you a ryche man and yf God spare me lyfe. Syr sayd Reynawde god yelde you, and we shal serue you truly, &amp; thus they departed eche fro other. The next day after whan the kynge was rysen out of hys bed: he made Reynawde to come afore hym. And after he tooke .xx. knyghtes w<SUP>t</SUP> hym and no more &amp; tooke his barge vpon gyrond and passed ouer the ri∣uer Reynawde and hys bretherne w<SUP>t</SUP> hym, and they dyd so muche that thei came vpon the roche, and whā they sawe the place so fayre and so plea∣saunt:
<PB N="xli" REF="46"/> the kynge was meruayled of it and Reynawde was ryght glad, for the great strength that the place had, for if he might doo so muche to buylde there a castelli he should not doubt Charlemayne of a penye nor none other person of the worlde whā vitayles were in it. For vpon the hi∣ghest of the mountayne sprong oute a fayre fountayne and plenteouse y∣noughe for .x. thousand persons.</P>
<P>Whan the knyghtes that were wyth the kynge saw the place so fayre and so pleasaunt and so stronge with all: they were greatly abasshed, a knight than tooke the kyng and had hym a lytle a syde and tolde him. Syr what is this that ye wyl doo? Wyl ye haue a lorde aboue you? Will ye doo make heere a Fortresse? I tell you vpon my faythe that yf Reynawde set heere a Castel, he shal feare you litle nother you nor all other barons of Gascoyn, for Reynawde is suche a knyght as ye knowe, and also hys brethern and theyr cosyn Mawgys, and also they be straungers, &amp; soone they shall beare you great harme yf they wyll doo to hī some other good yf ye wyll beleue me, and let thys a∣lone, for ouer greate harme myght come to you therof.</P>
<P>THan whan kyng Yon vnder∣stode such wordes: he became all abasshed of it, for he wyste well that the knight sayde trouth, and ly∣tell it lacked that the werke of y<SUP>e</SUP> Ca∣stell came not forth, he began to thī∣ke a lytle and after he sayde, that he had promysed it to Reynawde, and thus he sayd to the knyght that thée Castell should be made, so called he Reynawde and sayde to hym. My good freende where wyll ye that the castel be made? Syr sayd Reynawde, I wyll yf it please you that it be set here in the same place vpon this ro∣che. Certes sayd the kynge I gyue it to you. Now hast you to see that it be made and builded vp as ye thynke best, and than ye shall doubt nother me nor my folke. Syr said Reinawde let be these wordes, for it is no need to speake therof. For I certyfye you as a true knyght that I had muche leuer to dye an euyll death amonge the Turkes, than that I should thī∣ke treason vpon you nor vpon no o∣ther. Syr I am and haue betake he∣therto and holde for a true knyght, god giue me grace that I doo not fro hens forthou wherby I should other∣wyse be taken. Syr thynke you by∣cause I am enemy to Charlemayne my Souerayne lorde, that I should be therfore a traytour and that I haue doone agaynst hym some trea∣son. Wyt that whan I slew Berthe∣lot his nenew, alas I dyd it in my defence, for he drew fyrst bloud vpō me wythout reason or cause whye. But I swere to you vpon my fayth that yf any man doo any wrong vn∣to you: I shall auenge you therof af∣ter my power, but and yf ye haue a∣nye suspection vpon me: gyue me it not. Good freende Reynawd sayde the kynge I dyd but iape with you. For I knowe well your trouth and well ye haue shewed it vnto me, god thāke you, And therfore I haue graunted it vnto you, and yet I doo
<PB REF="47"/> And I wyll y<SUP>e</SUP> ye be lorde aboue me and of my lande.</P>
<P>ANd whan Reynawde vnder∣stode the curtesye &amp; the good∣nes of the kyng: he thāked him right muche, &amp; he sent thorough all the lād and made come all the maysters ma∣sons and carpēters and many other crafty men in suche worke, so muche that they were well two hundred be∣syde the labourers, and whan al hys stuffe was redye: he made theym to buylde there a stronge castell, wher∣of the great hall was fyrst made and after many chambres and than the great tower. And whā the doungeō was wel closed: Reynawde made af∣ter all the castell to be closed rounde aboute w<SUP>t</SUP> double walles hie &amp; thick of hard stones, &amp; many toures vpon that it fered no sawtyng of no syde of it, &amp; made to this castell foure ga∣tes and no mo, and also he made the portcolysse fawsebrayes &amp; barbaca∣nes well defensable so that it myght be no better. Whan the castel was ac∣complysshed: Reynawde and his bre¦thern were therof ryght glad, for it semed them that they were assured from theyr enemyes. And whā king Yon knew that the castell was ac∣complysshed and full made: he went to see it. And whan Reynawde wist that y<SUP>e</SUP> kyng came: he went agaynste hym and welcomed him full honest∣ly &amp; made him go vp to y<SUP>e</SUP> great toure of the fortres, bycause he should see the compas of the Castell rounde a∣boute at his ease, for the great toure men myght se all. The kyng behelde well the fayre werke y<SUP>t</SUP> was so plea∣saunt and so stronge wyth all and the fayre fountayne that was in the middes of it. And thā he called Rey∣nawde &amp; sayd to hym. Good freende Reynawde how shall this castell be called? for me semeth it ought wel to haue a noble name, for y<SUP>e</SUP> great beau¦tie wherof it is garnysshed, syr sayd Reynawde it hath no name yet, &amp; yf it please you ye shall gyue it a name as it shall lyke you best. Certes sayd the kyng the place is prety and fayre &amp; I wyll that it be called Mountaw¦ban, and than the kinge made to be knowen through all his lande, that who wolde come dwel and enhabite in the sayde castell, whyche was as great as a towne, he should be free of all maner of duytes the space of ten yeres.</P>
<P>THan whan the folke of y<SUP>e</SUP> coun∣trey knewe the freedome of the castel, ye should haue see come there knightes, gentylmen, burgeys yonge and olde, yeomen and folke of all maner of craftes so that this ca∣stell was so peopled of all maner of folke that in all the coūtrey was no towne so wel peopled, for there dwel¦led .v. hundred burgeys al riche men &amp; there were wel. L. tauerners, and xv.c. men of crafte besyde all other folke, &amp; shortly to speake Mountaw¦ban was so well garnysshed and so riche w<SUP>t</SUP>in a litle while y<SUP>t</SUP> it was great meruayle for to see, and wyt it that the kyng Yon loued Reynawde with so good a loue, for bycause of the greate worthynes of hym that he gaue to hym valerey and all the Lordeshyp that was worthe a thou∣sande marke of good rente, moche well set, and whan the barons saw them
<PB N="xlii" REF="47"/> that the kynge loued Reynawde so wel: they were wroth for it and had enuye vpon hym, and they came to the kynge and sayd to hym, syr take wel good heed what ye doo, for moū¦tawban is ryght stronge &amp; so is Rey∣nawde suche a knight that none bet∣ter is not in all the remenaūt of the worlde, and yf it happe by any wise that he be an angred vpon you: he shall mow lyghtly beare to you and to all your folke ouer greate dom∣mage. Lordes sayd the kyng ye saye trouth, but Reynawde is so gentyl &amp; so curtoys of himselfe that he shall neuer thynke vpon no trayson nor to no shame in no maner of wyse.</P>
<P>Syr sayd than an olde knyght that stode before the kyng, yf ye wyll be∣leue me: I shall tell you how ye shall alwayes be lorde and mayster aboue Reynawde al the tyme of your life. Freend sayd the kyng tell me thys I pray you. Syr sayd the knyght gyue him your syster to his wyfe, so shall she be well maryed, for Reynawde is well a noble gentylmā of al foure sydes: and therby ye shall be assured that he shal neuer be angry ne wroth with you. Freend sayd kynge you ye gyue me good counsell, and I shall doo it as ye haue counselled me, but I pray you that ye purchase this ma¦ter. Syr sayd the olde knyght syth y<SUP>t</SUP> I know your wyll in thys behalfe: I shall doo my best for to brynge the matter to a conclusyon effectuel. Af∣ter these wordes thus sayd: the king returned agayne to Bordews with ioye deuysyng with the olde knyght of the matter wherof they had spo∣ken togither.</P>
<P>THe first dai of the moneth of May, Reynawde went from his castel of Mountawban to Bor∣dews for to see kyng yon &amp; tooke A∣larde his bother with hym. And whā the kyng yon wyste of it: he came to hym agaynst, &amp; receyued Reynawde with great ioye and kyssed hym full sweecely. And after the kynge tooke hym by the hand and went vp toge∣ther to the hall of the palays and so forth to the chambre of parements whyche was hanged right rychelye. And than the kyng called for y<SUP>e</SUP> cheffe for to playe at it with Reynawde, And as they were playing together there came in the olde knyght that had charge of the kinge for to make the mariage of Reynawde, and of the kynges Syster, whyche knyght was called Godefray of Molins, &amp; whā he was come afore the kyng: he sayd. Heare lord{is} what I wil tel you, to nyght as I was in my bed a slepe me semed that I saw Reynawde the sonne of Aymon y<SUP>t</SUP> was set hyghe in a chayre and all the people of thys Realme enclyned theymselfe before him. And y<SUP>e</SUP> king gaue to hym a sper∣hawke mewed full fayre and good, and me semed also that than came a great bore out of the woodes y<SUP>t</SUP> made an horryble noyse, so that no bodye durste not aproche nyghe him three men assayled him, but they coulde not hurte him and passed by theym. And whan Reynawde sawe that: he lighted vpon Bayarde and came a∣gaynst him and faught with hym &amp; hurted him sore, and than I woke out of my sleape, and whan the olde knyghte hadde sayde so: then rose
<PB REF="48"/> a doctour that was called bernarde the whych was ryght wise &amp; a great clerke and sayd, fayre Lordes yf ye lyst to herken: I shall expowne &amp; de∣clare vnto you the sygnyfycacion of this dreme. Wyt it that the chayer where Reynawde sat betokeneth the castell that he hath buylded, and the people that bowed hemself towarde hym signifyeth y<SUP>e</SUP> folke y<SUP>t</SUP> are come to dwell there. And the gyft that the kyng gaue to hym: betokeneth that y<SUP>u</SUP> king Yon shal gyue him his sister to wyfe, y<SUP>e</SUP> wilde bore sygnyfyeth som great prince christē or Paynym that shall come to assayle kynge yon, and Reynawde shal defēde hym by force of armes, and the same is the sygny∣fication of the dreame of Godfray &amp; I indygne for to speake should coun¦sell that the mariage should be doon of Reynawde &amp; of the syster of kyng yon. For they shalbe thus both right well and richely wedded, and than y<SUP>e</SUP> kynge answered thou haste spoken well and wysely. Whan the clerke had declared the betokenyng of the dreame of tholde knyght Godfray y<SUP>e</SUP> kyng yon sayd that touchynge thys maryage the thinge was well agrea¦ble vnto hym. And whan Reynawde vnderstode thys warde: he sayd to y<SUP>e</SUP> king, Syr gramercy of the fayre gift that ye doo to me, but and if it please you ye shal haue a lytle pacyence vn¦to the tyme that I haue counselled with my brethern &amp; my cosyn maw∣gys. Brother sayde Alarde ye haue sayd yll. What refuse you of the king so great a gift as he giueth you now yf ye wyll beleue me ye shall fulfyll the kynges wyll incontynent for to me and to my bretherne it shall plea∣se well. And whan the king gaue you not his syster but a symple Da∣moysell yet ought you to beleue him and doo after his wyl. Brother said Reynawde, it is not the fyrste tyme that ye haue giuen to me good coun¦sell and true, and I promyse you I shall doo it syth that ye doo counsel me so. And than Reynawde turned hymselfe to warde the king and said to hym. Syr I am all together redye to doo all that ye wyl, and than Rey¦nawde rose vp and the kynge tooke hym by the hand and made his sister to be affyaunced vnto hym.</P>
<P>THan whā the maryage was made accorded, &amp; made sure of the one parte &amp; of thother: y<SUP>e</SUP> kinge yon came to the chāber of his sister, and found her besy aboute a penoun¦cel of a spere, that she made ful fayre for y<SUP>e</SUP> knight Reynawde but she durst not tell it. The kynge salued her as soone as he sawe her, and the noble mayde rose vp anon against her bro¦ther and made hym due reuerence ryght manerly. Fayre syster sayd the kynge I haue doo marye you well and hyghlye. Whan the pucell vnder¦stode hym: she began to chaunge her colour and bowed her body to hym, and sayd no worde of a longe whyle. And whan she had the power for to speake: she sayd to the kyng her bro∣ther, syr to whome haue you geuen me. Fayre Syster sayd the kynge I haue gyuen you vnto the best knight of the worlde, it is Reynawde the sonne of Aymon the noble knyght &amp; valyaunt. Whan the noble Damoy∣sell
<PB N="xliii" REF="48"/> vnderstode that it was to Rey∣nawde to whome her brother had ma¦ryed her she was ryght glad of it, for she loued Reynawde of a great loue and sayd to the kynge. Syr I wyll doo withal my hert your commaun∣dement and your wyll. Thā the king tooke her by the hand &amp; brought her to the palays, and said to Reynawde afore al his bacōs. Holde heere wor∣thy knyght Reynawde I gyue you my syster to your wyfe and spouse.</P>
<P>Syr sayd Reynawde a thousand gra¦mercyes of so fayre a gyft that ye gi∣ue to me presentlye, for it appertey∣neth not so great a gyft to so poore a knyght as I am, than tooke Rey∣nawde the pucell and fyaunced her, and sware. And the kynge wolde make no taryeng therat, but tooke y<SUP>e</SUP> pucel by the hande, and brought her to the churche well honourably, and the byshop of Bordews wedded thē. And whan Reynawde had his wyfe espoused: he sente for hys bretherne &amp; for his cosyn Mawgys that were at Mountawban, the whiche made great Ioye, and made all Mounta∣ban for to be hanged wyth ryche ta∣pissery. And than they moūted their horses all couered wyth sendall and wente to Bordews, and met with Reynawde and hys wyfe by the way where as great Iustinge was made afore the ladyes. And after the Iu∣styng was doone: they came all to Mountawban, and whan they were come there: the Ioye began for to be greate in the castell as god had des∣cended there. For to say trouth .viii. dayes lasted the feast, &amp; many great gyftes were presented and gyuen to the lady. And whan the feast had en∣dured as longe as I tell you: The king Yon went againe to Bordews ryght glad of the maryage, that he had made of Reynawde and of hys syster. For he thought wel that Rey∣nawde should helpe hym agaynst al men, and he sayd trouth. For after y<SUP>t</SUP> the Mariage was ones made there was no baron in all Gascoygne y<SUP>t</SUP> durste looke vp, and yet there were some that wolde not doo theyr de∣uoyre to the kynge, but Reynawde made them well come foorth for to doo the kynges commaūdement ac∣cordynge to theyr lygeaunce wolde they or not. For reynawde was both loued and doubted through all the lande of Gascoygne. ¶ But now le∣ueth heere the history to speke of Rei∣nawde and of his bretherne and of Mawgys. And retourneth to speke of the king Charlemayne that went to saynt Iames in Galyce for to do penaunce for hys synnes.</P>

<P>NOw sheweth the History that Charlemayne was at Paris and came to hym a deuocyon for to go in pylgrymage to saynte Iames in Galice. And so he departed out of Parys and tooke in hys companye Ogyer the dane and the duke Nay∣mes of Bauyere and many other ba∣rons and great lordes. Whan they were vpon theyr waye: they dyd so muche by theyr Iurneys y<SUP>t</SUP> they cam to saynt Iames in Galice. And whā they were arryued there: The kynge went streyght to the churche and of∣fred afore the auter .x. marke of fyne Golde. And whan he had offred and doone his deuocyon: he tooke on hys waye agayne and came with hys fe∣lawship to Bordews. And in his cominge thither: he looked ouer the riuer of girond not ferre thence, and saw the castel of Mountawban that was vpon a roche so fayre &amp; so wel made and so well shette wyth fayre walles and thycke in the forme as I haue tolde you afore. And whā that
<PB N="xliiii" REF="49"/> Charlemayne sawe it, he behelde it well a longe whyle and than sayd. A good lorde yonder is a fayre castell strong and wel set. I see well that the kyng Yon hath made it of late, for it semeth yet to be all newe, and it can be none otherwise syth that he hath buylded it in suche a strong place, but that he thynketh to make warre to some body. And than he called to hym a knight of the lond and sayd to hym tell me howe ye call that castel. Syr sayd the knyght the name is Moun∣tawban. He had great lust to speake, for yf he had keped his peace: there had been none other thyng of it, but he had suche woordes that afterward bare great harme to hym selfe, and to manye other. For he tolde Them∣perour that Reynawde and his bre∣thren the sonnes of Aymon had doo make the castell, &amp; was called Moun∣tawban. And how that the kyng Y∣on had geuen to Reynawde his sys∣ter to his wife.</P>
<P>WHan Charlemayne vnderstode these wordes: he was ryght angry for it and wrothe. And wyst not what he should saye, and helde hymself a great whyle that he spake not, and whan he had mused a lytle, he sayde to his folke, fayre lordes I shall tell you a wonder. For I haue founde myne enemyes in this lond, that ben the foure sonnes of Aymon. Now vp Ogyer and you duke Nay∣mes, lyght on horsbacke incontinent, and seke so muche kyng Yon that ye fynde hym, and tell hym in my be∣halfe that he yelde to me againe the foure sonnes of Aymon that be mine enemyes them whiche he hath wyth∣drawen and borne out agaynst me. And that he fynde me knyghtes for to bryng them onlye in to my lond for I am delyvered syth that I haue founde them: for to hange them or fley them: quycke. And yf he wyll not doo so: defye you hym on my be∣halfe. And tell hym that wythin this thre or foure monethes I shalbe with in his land of Gascoygne wyth all my Hoste, and I shall distroy and o∣uerthrowe all his townes and castel∣les, and yf I maye take hym: I shall punysshe hym wythout any mercy. Syr sayd Ogyer we shall doo youre commaundement, but we shall take with vs Sauces and hostes the whi∣che been prue and sage, and Charle∣maine said that he was content and incontinent they went on theyr way. And wente aboute to vnderstande where kyng Yon was. And so long they asked after hym that they founde hym at Mountawban euen at the foote of the roche. For the king yon went agayne to Bourdews and Rey∣nawde conueyed him. Whan Ogyer sawe Reynawde and the kyng Yon: he knewe them well. And inconty∣nente he salued the kyng, and sayde to him. Syr god geue you good lyfe and longe. And the kynge rendred to hym his salute, and after sayde to him. Of whence be you? syr sayde O∣gyer. We been of the sweet Fraunce. And also we be sente vnto you. And we are of Charlemaynes folke, now heare vs if it please you. Syr said the kyng ye be ryght welcome. Nowe tell on what ye wyll saye. Syr sayd Ogyer, Themperour Charlemayne
<PB REF="50"/> sendeth to you worde by vs that ye yelde agayne vnto hym his enemyes the whiche ye haue withdrawen into youre landes and ye sende to hym an hundrede of your men for to conduyte and brynge theym wyth hym vnto Fraunce. And yf ye refuse to doo this: We by his commaundement defye you of his be halfe. And within these iii. monethes he shall be in Gascoigne and shall take all your landes and shall be syege you with in the citie of Bordews. And yf he take you: he shal punyshe you in your body. Now haue we sayde our message, and yf it please you ye shall gyue vs an answere.</P>
<P>OGyer sayde the kynge, it is well trouthe that I haue reteyned the foure sonnes of Aymon, whyche bene worthye knyghtes, and so haue I reteyned theym because they bene prue and valiaunt in armes, and also that they haue holpē and socoured me at my great need. For I was disheri∣ted and vndoone for euer, if they had not bene. And for the greate good that they haue done to me: I haue gyuen my syster Germayne to Reynawde for his wyfe. And therefore I should be to cruell and eke well mischaunt if I should now take them into the han∣des of their enemyes mortall sith, that they haue doone to me so good seruyse I haue leuer to be disheryted and dye an euyll death than to yelde them or suffre that they haue anye harme nor shame to my power. For namely the kynge Charlemayne should than hol∣de me for a foole &amp; wel nyce. And ther∣fore Ogyer yf it please you ye shall tell the Emperoure from my behalfe that I shall for sake fyrst all my lon∣de and my realme than I should de∣lyuer them in his handes. And thys is my answere.</P>
<P>THan whan the king had sayd thus: Reynawde spake after and sayde. Ogier I meruayll greatly of the kynge Charlemaine that will not leaue vs in peace. He cast vs out of Fraunce poore &amp; disherited wherof I am ashamed, &amp; as ye knowe I wol∣de be reformed with reason to the say∣enge of his barons, but it pleaseth him not. And so he casted vs out of Moun∣tainforde shamefully, so that we wist not where we shoulde goe. And yet it suffyseth hym not, but he wyll caste vs out of y<SUP>e</SUP> londe of Gascoigne wher∣of he dooth great synne. For yet am I redy for to doo his wyll in reason &amp; ryght. And I tell you well that yf he refuse this by his pryde: I wyll well that he know that I and mi bretherne are not suche that shall be taken as lyghtly as he weeneth. And I promy∣se you that or euer he hath vs: I shall make hym more than .x. tymes angrie and wroth. For this that he dothe, he dothe it but of pryde. Ogyer I wyll well that kynge Charlmayne knowe y<SUP>t</SUP> the king yon of Gascoigne hath gy∣uen to vs leue to builde a Castel that hath to name. Mountawban, the whi∣che is strong and imprenable, &amp; yet I haue knyghtes with me that shall not fayle me at my need, and tell to kinge Charlemaine that sith I cannot haue no peace nor accorde with hī: y<SUP>t</SUP> I shal doo to hym all the dōmage and harme that shal be to me possyble for to doo.</P>
<PB N="xlv" REF="50"/>
<P>REinawde (said Ogier) ye spea∣ke not wysely, weene ye to a∣bashe vs with wordes? ye shal not so, but whā ye shall see the Hoste and the great power of Charlemayne to ge∣ther ye shal be sore abashed, and at the ende ye shall be full wrothe and sorye, ye knowe well that the Empe∣rour Charlemayne made you knight, and ye slewe his Neuewe Berthelot, and therfore think not to finde peace toward him, and ye weene to be assu∣red bycause the kyng yon hath made you to close a Castell, but well I wil that he knowe that he shall repente for it full sore. For afore two mone∣thes be past: we shal be in the middes of his lande, and shall destroy all his Realme, and we shall brenne bothe Castelles and townes. Ogier saide Reynawde I swere to you vpon my fayth that whan king Charlemaine shalbe with his hoste in to this land: he shall wisshe hym selfe soone a∣gaine in Fraūce with his folke. And whan he shall see the hard Iustyng and sharpe warre that I and my bre∣thren shal make against him: he and ye shalbe sore abasshed of it, and some of you speaketh nowe hye, that whan the deed shall come to profe: he shall be full lowe. Reynawde (sayde than Ogyer) I wyll hyde nothinge from you. The kyng Charlemayne hathe so great a power and is delibered for to besiege Bordews, and if he maye take you he shall punysshe you cruel∣lye, nowe doo as ye will. I haue tolde you al my message, and I goo againe to kyng Charlemayne. Whan he had sayde these wordes: he returned to∣ward king Charlemaine and shewed vnto hym what kinge you and Rey∣nawde had saide. And whan the king vnderstoode the same: he shooke all for anger &amp; saide, now shall it be seen how king yon and Reinawde shal de∣fende. Gascoigne against me, &amp; than went forth Charlemaine and passed the ryuer of Gyronde, &amp; rode so longe that he came to Parys, and the daye after he called al his barons that thei should come to him. And whan thei were all come: the kynge helde hys counsell and saide to them. Lordes I haue sent for you to tell you the great shame that the kinge yon of Gasco∣igne doth to me. For he holdeth the foure sonnes of Aymon my mortall enemies in dispi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of me, &amp; ye knowe what domage they haue doone to me. For they slewe my neuew Berthelo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. I dyd banisshe them out of Faunce, than made thei the castell of Moun∣taynforde within my land, and I cha∣sed them out of it. Nowe been they in Gascoigne wyth the kynge Yon that saith he shal defend them against me, and he hathe geuen his Sister to Reynawde, wherefore I praye you all that ye wyll helpe me that I be auenged.</P>
<P>ANd whā Charlemaine had said this: there was none of the ba∣rons that answered to him any worde, for they were werye of the warre that they had made so long a∣gainst Reynawde. And Charlemaine sawe that no bodye anwered to him no thing: he called to him the Duke Naimes and Ogier the Dane and the Erle Guydellon, and saide to them. Lordes what counsell doo you geue
<PB REF="51"/> gyue to me in this matter. Syr sayde the Duke Naymes, yf ye wyll beleue me I shall gyue you good counseyl. Suffre youre hoste to reste thys fyue yeres, bycause that your folke is wery of the warre, so shall they reste them selfe a lytell. And whan they shall be fresshe: than shal ye mow make warre at youre wyll, for euery manne shall than come to it with good wyll. And whan themperoure vnderstoode this counseyll: he was sore an angred for it that he wente almoste oute of hys witte, and as he would haue sayde a∣yenst the duke Naymes: there came a yonge gentylman of greate beautye, and brought in his company xxx. faire squiers well arayed, this yongelynge came to the palays and went vp, and whan he came afore the Emperour he made hys obeysaunce to hym full cur∣tessye, freend sayde the kynge ye be ryght welcome, what winde brought you hither and what be you? syr sayde the squier. I am called Rowlande of bretayne and I am the sonne of youre sister and of the duke of Myllon.</P>
<P>THan whan Charlemayne vnder∣stoode Rowlande speake thus: he was right glad of him and tooke him by the hand and kissed him many times, &amp; sayd to him, ye be righte wel∣come. I wil that ye be made a knyghte to morowe in the mornynge &amp; ye shall assaye your selfe vpon Reinawde the sonne of Aymon. Syr saide Rowland I shall do your commaundement and I promyse you Reynawde shall not be spared of me, and he shal not bere a∣waye nothinge of yours. He slewe my cosyn Berthelot wherof I am ryghte sory, and therefore I shall auenge hys death yf I may by ony maner, or elles Reynawde shall slea me. And in the mornynge the kynge Charlemayne dowbed hys neuewe Rowlande to a knyghte with muche Ioye and with great honour, &amp; as the feast was a do∣inge: there came a messanger that said to the Emperoure. Moste hye &amp; moste puyssaunte prince, your menne of Co∣loyne recommende them righte hum∣bly to your good grace, &amp; they doo you to wyt that the sarasyns haue besye∣ged them, and haue hurte them ryghte sore. For they haue brent and destroi∣ed all the country. Wherefore they be∣seche you ryght humblye that ye come for to helpe &amp; socoure them if it be your pleasure, or elles they are but dead, and vtterly destroyed.</P>
<P>ANd when the Emperoure vn∣derstood these tydynges: he bow∣ed his head toward the erth, and beganne to thinke a litell. And whan Rowlande saw his vncle that mused th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in him selfe: he said to him, wher∣of be ye so dismayed. Geue me some parte of your menne. And I shall goe reyse the syege of Coleyne. And whan the Emperour heard Rowland speake soo: he was ryghte gladde of it, and enbraced and kyssed hym full sweetlye and sayde to him, fayre neuewe bles∣sed bee the houre that euer ye were borne. For I knowe for sertayne that ye shall keep me from payne and tra∣uayle, and in you shall be my reste and my comforte. And I wyll that ye goe there. And than he gaue hym twenty thousand men of armes well horsed and well arayed. And whan
<PB N="xlvi" REF="51"/> they were wel apparelled, Rowlād lyghted vpon his horse and sayde to hys vncle the kinge. Sir I cōmende you to god. Fayre neuew said Char∣lemaine I haue taken to you my mē in your keeping, I praye you that ye will keep them well, &amp; do so muche that ye get worship, &amp; god be with you. Sir said Rowlande be not dis∣maied, for at my retourne (if it please god) ye shal know how that we haue doo. And whan he had saide thys worde: he tooke leaue of his vncle &amp; went on his waye with his folke, &amp; they rode so longe by their iourneys that they came to Coloine all by ni∣ghte, &amp; put their busshement nyghe their hoste, &amp; as they were nighe the hoste: thei met with certeine sarasins that came againe with a great praie of oxen and sheep and of men &amp; wo∣men that were their prysoners, and made them suffre great martyrdome</P>
<P>WHan the frenshemē saw their enmies: they saide in this ma∣ner, lordes oure lorde hathe sente vs hyther. Heere bene the traytours sa∣rasyns, that so sore we haue desired for to fighte with them. Now shall it be seene what we shal do with thē: put vs amonge thē, for at this hou∣re they shall be ouerthrowen, whan they had spoken ynough: they made none other taryinge, but spurred their horses and ran vpon the sara∣syns by great strengthe, so that in a lytle whyle they had them dyscomfi∣ted so sharpelye that they slew them all, and recouered all the prysoners &amp; the bestes. ¶ And shortly to speake whan the hoste of the painimes hea∣rde the noise of the frenshemen: they moued theim selfe, &amp; lyghted vpon their horses, &amp; vpon the frensshemen And whan the frensshemen saw thē come: they went agayne to their bus∣shement as well as they could, and beganne to chase theim.</P>
<P>ANd whan Rowlande sawe that it was time to set vpon: he yssued oute of his embusshmente with his folke, and went and smote vpon the sarasyns so harde that he casted to the earthe a greate parte of theim. And to speake shortly: the ba∣tayle began so cruell &amp; so fell that it was pitie to see. For ye should haue seene so many speares broken, &amp; so many sheldes in two, &amp; so many sa∣rasins lying dead on the grounde: so that with paine men might goe by for the deade men that laye so thicke one vpō thother, &amp; Rowlande spur∣red his horse with the spurres &amp; wēt &amp; smote a sarasin that was a kynge &amp; the chiefe of the sarasins hoste with so great mighte that he ouerthrewe him to the erthe, but he slew hym not of that stroke, but taryed vpon hym and gaue to him suche a stroke with his swearde vpon his helme that he made him all astonyed. And whan Rowlande sawe hym also euyl arai∣ed: he bowed hymselfe &amp; tooke hym for his prysoner, and dyd sette hym againe vpon his hors &amp; brought him with hym. And whan the sarasyns sawe their lorde taken and sawe the wundres of armes that Rowland made and of the frenshemenne: they put theimselfe to flyghte full shame∣fully. And whan Rowlande saw the
<PB REF="52"/> sarasins flee thus: he cried wyth a hyghe voice. Lordes goe after theym for they flee al, and if they scape vs: it shalbe to vs a greate blame towarde myne vncle the kyng Charlemaine, and we shalbe holden for cowardes, wherfore I pray you lette not one es∣cape, for ye shall haue theym lyght∣lye syth that I holde in my hande theyr kyng. Whan the frenshemenne heard Rowlād speke thus: they said free knight be not dysmaied of no∣thyng, for we make no doubte that none of theym shall scape, but they shalbe taken or slayne. Lordes sayde than the king sarasin that Rowland had taken that had to name Escor∣fawde. They bene all mine, I praye you that ye kylle theym not, for they ben all ynough discomfited, sith that ye haue taken me, but gyue theym truce, and haue me to kyng Char∣lemayne yf it please you. And yf ye may doo so much that Charlemaine pardone me the great offence that I haue done to him: I shall boide fro hence forth all myne heritage of him &amp; yet all my lygnage shall be obey∣saunte vnto his will, and of this ye may beleue me. By my heade sayde Rowlande ye speake curteously, &amp; by my faith saide Naimes Escorfawde sayth well, and we shall doo so, they gaue truce to the sarasins and tooke their waie againe to Charlemayne &amp; brought Escorfawde with theym and so long they rode that they came to Paris. And whā the king Char∣lemayne knewe that his neuewe Rowlande was come againe to Pa∣rys, and that he had dyscomfyted the sarasins and brought prisoner with him kyng Escorfawde: he was right glad of it, and anon he moun∣ted on horsebacke, and came ayenst his neuewe Rowlande. And whan Rowland saw him: he lighted down from hys horse, and went and kest hym selfe to the feet of kyng Char∣lemayne his vncle. And anon he made him to rise vp, and kyssed him sweetly: And than Rowlande said to him. Sir here I deliuer vnto you the king Escorfawde, that we haue taken. He hath tolde vs that he shal make himselfe a christen mā and that he &amp; his lignage shal holde their landes of you, yf ye will par∣done him youre ylle wyll. Neuewe sayde the king Charlemayne there is no trust in him, and therfore I wil kee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me from hym. Than com∣maunded the emperoure that Escor∣faude shoulde be brought to prison, and that he shoulde be wel kept and that he shoulde haue all his will of meate &amp; drinke. And after whan Es∣corfawde was put in prison: the king Charlemayne dyd calle to him the Duke Naymes and sayde to him what thinke you by my neuew Row¦lande, what dyd he whan the batayl was assembled. Sir sayde the duke Naymes, of Rowlande nedeth not to speke, for neuer sith that god was borne, of the vyrgin Marie: suche a knight was not seen. For he alone hath ouercome the sarasins by hys great prowes. And yf he had a horse that might beare him whan he were armed: I swere by my fayth that ye should neuer haue enmye, but that he should bring him to your mercye by force of armes. So muche he
<PB N="xlvii" REF="52"/> is prue and valyaunte. The kyng Charlemayn swore by his head that he was right glad therof. But tell me sayde he to the duke Naymes: where might menne fynde suche a good horse as ye speake of? Sir sayd the duke Naymes yf ye will beleue me: I shal geue you good counseyll. Make to be cryed with a trompet vpon Mounte martyr that ye wyll see renne al the horses of your hoste, And he that shal renne best: shal win youre crowne of golde, and fyue hū∣dred marke of fine syluer, and a hun∣dred rolles of sylke. And all thus ye shall mowe knowe the best horse of your realme. And whan ye shall haue seen him: by hym, and gyue hym to your neuewe Rowlande, and after gyue leue to all youre barons vnto the feast of saynt Iohn the bap∣tyst next comming. Duke Naymes (said the Emperoure Charlemaine) ye gyue me good counseyll, &amp; I shal doo thus as ye haue deuised. Than the kinge Charlemayne made to be cryed vpon Mounte martyr euyn thus as the duke Naymes had deui∣sed, and did make the listes for the horses to renne in. And whan thys was done: he made his crown to be sette at the ende of the lystes, and al∣so the fyue hundred marke of siluer and the hundred rolles of sylke, and this hanging: a yeman went to hys countrey in Gascoine, and as he pas¦sed thorough Moūtawbā: he recoun∣ted to Reynawde and to Mawgys all the thyng that menne wolde doo at Paris. And how Rowlande was come to the courte. And how he had dyscomfited Escorfawde the kyng sarasyn, and howe the king Charle∣mayne wolde haue the best horse of all his realme, for to gyue hym to Rowlande, and shewed the sayd yo∣man the price that the King had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et. And also how the Emperour Char∣lemayne gathered his hoste for to come to Mountawban. And howe the course of y<SUP>e</SUP> horses should be made at saint Iohns time next commyng.</P>
<P>THan whan Reinawd vnder∣stode this worde: he began to laugh and after he said to Mawgis, Cosyn by all halowes of god, Char∣lemaine shal see the best turne of the worlde, but he shall not knowe that I shall haue his crowne. For I will goe there vpon Bayarde to see how he shall proue himselfe at this time. Syr sayd Mawgis ye shall not doo so yet, but and if ye will goe there suffre that I here you companye, so shal you be more sure, &amp; haue with vs knightes well armed. Gladly sayde Reynawde sith that ye will doo so whan it was time for to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue tow∣arde Paris: Reinawde called to him Alarde Guycharde, and Rycharde his brethren and Mawgis hys Co∣syn and sayd vnto theym. It is time that we goe to Paris. Take knigh∣tes chosen and put oure selfe in the waye. Syr sayde his bretherne your commaundemente shall be doone. And whan they were all appareyl∣led: Reynawd came to his wyfe and sayde to her. Lady I praye you that ye doo keep wel my castel, and I shal come sone againe. Syr sayde she cō∣maunde your knightes that they ben not oute of the waye, and I pro∣myse
<PB REF="53"/> you if the king yon my brother came himself: he should nor come in nor none other vnto the time that ye be come again. Now go god be with you. Than tooke Reinawde leue of his wife, &amp; sette himselfe toward the waye and his folke &amp; went to Paris And whan they were come to Orle∣aūce, &amp; had passed the riuer of Loire menne asked theym of whens they were? And Mawgis that spake for them all answered. Lordes we bene Bournoys that goe to Paris for to assaye our horses for to win the price that the kinge hathe set vpon. Yf god will so consente. Than by fayre wordes they passed forthe &amp; so long they rode that they came to Melym but they entred not within the towne but lodged theym selfe in a great va∣ley, and there they soiourned theym selfe and their horses foure dayes.</P>
<P>THan whan came the euen of saint Iohan: Reynawde called Mawgis &amp; saide to him. What shall we do? to morowe shall be the courses of the horses wherfore I say that it is couenable that we goe lye to night at paris, cosin saide Maw∣gis ye say wel &amp; wisely. Nowe lette me do a litil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and please you. Than tooke Mawgis an herbe &amp; stamped it vpō a stone with the pomel of hys swerde, and tempered it with water and rubbed bayarde therwith so that anon he became all white in suche wise that they that had seen him be∣fore: knew him not, &amp; after he enoin∣ted Reynawde with an oyntymente that he bare alwaies with him &amp; in continente he became to the age of xx. yeres. And whā he had thus atur¦ned Reynawde &amp; his horse: he tooke hym &amp; brought him afore his breth∣ren &amp; afore the other knightes &amp; said to them. Lordes tel me how thynke you haue I not wel trāsfigured him? shall not they maye come againe and not be knowen? Behold bayard how he is wexen white he shall lese the price for age.</P>
<P>THan whan the barons saw Reynawde &amp; bayarde so tur∣ned: they begā to laugh &amp; were great∣ly merueylled how Mawgys hadde thus disfigured them. Whan Maw∣gys had transfigured Reynawde &amp; bayarde and himself also: Reynawd mounted vpon bayarde and Maw∣gys vpō morel, &amp; tooke leue of their folke. But Reynawde at his depar∣tynge sayd to his brethren, haue no fere for me. For I shall not be kno∣wen yf god wyll. Than wente Rey∣nawde on his way, &amp; his folke wept for him, for Reinawde went in such a place where he hadde manye en∣myes. For yf Charlemayne had co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ne take him: al the golde of the world had not saued him, but he shold haue caused him to be hanged. And whan they departed: Alarde sayd to Maw∣gis I pray you for god that ye haue my brother Reynawde for recom∣mēded, for if it were not for the trust that I haue to you, I should not suf∣fre that he shoulde go to parys for al the golde of spaine. And than Rey∣nawde and Mawgys went on theyr waye. ❧ Now shall I leue a litil to speke of them. And shall retourne to the kyng Charlemayne that was at the
<PB N="xlviii" REF="53"/> Parys with his folke.</P>
<P>CHarlemaine sawe his barons that were all come, and than he called the Duke Naymes, Ogyer the Dane, and Foulques of Moryllon and said to them. Lordes I praye you that ye take an hundred knightes wel armed and goe towarde the waye of Orleaunce and beware that none goe by but ye knowe their names &amp; that they bene well aduised, for I doubte me sore of Reynawde, that he shall come, for he weneth well him selfe to be ouer subtyll, and yf it came in hys head: he should come sone hytherward Syr sayde the barons we shall doo gladly your commaundemente, and if Reynawde be so folisshe that he come hytherwarde: he shal not escape vs, but he shall be deade or taken and brought afore you. And thā they tooke leue of Charlemayne and wente to make them ready nere their horses, &amp; after mounted on horsebacke with an hundred knyghtes well armed and rode the waye towarde Orleaunce, and arested themselfe in the myddes of the waye, foure myles oute of Pa∣rys (and there they were a longe while that no bodye passed by) and endured great hungre and thurste. And whan the duke Naymes saw that they were there for nought: he sayde to Ogyer. Syr Ogyer by my faythe the Kynge Charlemayne maketh vs lyke fooles and holdeth vs for nice and musardes that he maketh vs to tary heere about nought. Syr sayde Ogyer ye saye trouth, and God confounde me yf I tary ony lenger. And whan they wol∣de haue comen againe abacke: the duke Naymes sawe come a farre Rey∣nawd and Mawgys. Thā said Nay∣mes to foulques of Moryllon, yonder I see commyng two menne on horse∣backe. And whan that Foulques saw them: he cried with an hyghe voyce, by my faith heere commeth Reynawd Nowe can he not escape by no maner, but he shall be hanged. By my faythe said the Duke Naymes ye say trouth, For the horse y<SUP>t</SUP> cometh afore: is much lyke Baiarde the horse of Reinawde, yf he were of a nother coloure. Whan that Foulques vnderstode these wor∣des: he sette handes to his swerde and came ayenst Reynawde ryghte nere, and when he was well nyghe them: he behelde them. And whan he sawe that it was not Reynawde: he was a l abasshed and drewe hym selfe abacke, and Reynawde and Mawgys rode furthe theyr wayes. And whan the Duke Naymes sawe that they came furthe be went ayenste them and called Mawgys and sayde to hym, what ben ye? and whether go ye? Sir saide Mawgys I am borne of Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on and my name is Iousser. Freend said the duke Naymes canne not ye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell me nothing of Reinawde the sonne of Aymon the worthy knight? yea saide Mawgis by my faithe, he hath ridden with vs two daies, and he is not pas∣sed two miles behind vs. At that hor∣re Reinawde spake not, thā said Nai∣mes what is he that is with you that holdeth him soo still and that saieth no worde? I beleue that he hathe so∣me euill thought, sir saide Mawgis it is my sonne, and he can not speake no frensh. For he hath bene nourisshed in the greate Bretaine. Whan the
<PB REF="54"/> duke Naymes vnderstoode this: he sayde to Reynawde tell me vassell knowest thou no tydynges of Rey∣nawde the sonne of Aymon? and Rei∣nawde answered to him in this wise. By my fayth no poynt frenche graūt Bretaine horse a Paris cloyth gane∣ra my. And counterfetted thus hys longuage, bicause the duke Naymes should not knowe him.</P>
<P>THan whan the duke Naymes heard Reinawde speake th{us} euyl: he began to laugh. And after saide to him againe, a hundred deuyl∣les haue well taught thee to speake so good frenche, vassell I wote not what thou sayest thou arte more lyke a foole than a bisshop. And so Nay∣mes let him in peace. And than Rey∣nawde and Mawgys tode so longe that they came to Parys tyme ynou∣ghe for to doo theyr enterpryse. And at the entre of the towne: they mette with an euill rybaude, vnto whome GOD geue yll aduenture. For he knew Reinawde. And as soone as he sawe him: he beganne to cry with an high voice, heere commeth Reinawde the sonne of Aymon. Whan the folke vnderstoode the cry: they wente that way. And whan the yl rybawde saw com so many folke: he was yet more hardye than he was afore, and wente afore the other, and tooke Reinawde by the bridle of Baiarde. And whan Baiarde sawe that: he lifted his fore∣foote and smote the ribaude vpon the brest, that he brast the herte in his be∣lye, &amp; casted him all dead to the erthe And whā the people saw the stroke: thei began all to laugh, and Bayard went forth, &amp; Maugis after that thei were not knowen: &amp; passed through the towne to the market. And whan thei were comen there afore the lod∣ges: thei founde all the Innes full. Wherof Reynawde was maruailed. And so they lighted at a cordeners house, that was of the deuilles side. For by him was almoste Reinawde and Mawgys taken, and delyuerd to Charlemaine that his bretherne shol∣de not haue holpen hym of no thynge. whan they were lyghted and lodged where it is sayde, &amp; that their horses were well dressed: Mawgys dyd doo make a bedde for Reynawde and toke a thred of sylke, and sered it well and came to Bayarde, and bounde hym the mowes of the feet there withall well streyte. And the hoste behelde well this, and after said to him. Why haue you thus bounde this horse? he shall not conne well goe. But tel me what knighte is he that oweth the horse? For if he had of age more than he hath? I should wene to knowe him For he is muche lyke Reynawde the sonne of Aymon. Syr saide Mawgis I haue bounde thys horse thus by∣cause he wyll fyght, and the yeman that rydeth vpon him is my sonne.</P>
<P>Now haue I telled you that, that ye haue asked me. Certes answered the hoste youre sonne is a fayre felawe, but I beleue ye mocke me. ¶ Nowe shall ye heare a greate misaduenture that happed to Reynawde and also vnto Mawgys. For thus as Maw∣gys spake with his hoste: he named Reynawde. Ha syr sayde the hoste ye haue sayde ynoughe, ye need not for to hyde it ony more. For it is Rey∣nawde
<PB N="xlix" REF="54"/> without ony doubte that slewe Bertheloc the neuewe of the kynge with a chesse boorde. I shal tell it to y<SUP>e</SUP> kinge afore that I slepe.</P>
<P>ANd whan Reynawde vnder∣stood this: he shooke al for an∣gre. And rose frō his place and tooke his swerde &amp; saide, hoste ye haue mis∣saide. For I neuer sawe Reynawde, nor I wor not what he is, holde youre peace said the hoste I knowe you well By my head ye are Reynawde the sō∣ne of Aymon. And whan he had saide these wordes: he wente oute of hys house. And whan Reynawde saw y<SUP>t</SUP>: he wente a good pace after his hoste and smote him so greate a stroke with his swerde vpon his head that he clo∣ue him vnto the teeth. And whan Mawgis sawe this, he was ryghte sory for it, and saide to Reynawde.</P>
<P>What haue you doone? haue you loste your wytte? but if God thinke vpon vs we bene lost and shamed. I can not doo therto sayd Reynawde. But how someuer it gothe he hath his rewar∣de. And than Mawgis came forth∣with to the stable and sadled Bayar∣de. And made Reinawde to mounte vpon him, and after himselfe lyghted vpon Morell, and went out of the lod∣ges. And whan the wyfe and the chil∣dren of the hoste sawe thys that Rey∣nawde had doone: they began to crye, But Reynawde and Mawgys were soone out of their waye, so that none wyste where that they were become and wente and put them selfe amon∣ge the other in the prese, and they were neuer knowen. But Baiarde wente haltinge, and wente to the gate of saynt Martyne, and there they a∣bode all the nighte. And whan it was day: they wente with the other to the chyrche where the kinge hearde his masse. And whan the seruyse was done: the kynge came oute of the chur∣che, &amp; mounted vpon his horse, &amp; all the other barons with him and came vpon the riuer of Sayne in to the me∣dowe, and Renawde and Mawgys wente with them, but Bayarde went ryghhte sore haltynge. And whan the Kynge was come there: he commaū∣ded that his crowne shoulde be sette at the ende of the lystes, and the fyue houndred marke of syluer, and also the houndred clothes of sylke, and in∣continente the Duke Naymes and Ogier did as the Kings had com∣maunded. And whan all was appa∣railled: Thenne shoulde ye haue sene knightes leape on horsebacke. For e∣uerye man trowed to haue gotten the price, and the kinge commaunded to the duke Naymes and to Ogyer, vnto Guydellon of Burgoyne and to Ry∣charde of Normandy, that they should take a hundred knyghtes well armed and that they shoulde keep well the feaste, that no noyse nor no stryfe were there made, and that none should wronge the other, and they dyd his commaundemente. And thenne the knyghtes that shoulde renne: begane for to beholde Reynawde that was mounted vpon haltinge Bayarde, and so they beganne for to laughe and scorne with him. And sayde in Iape the one vnto the other, this felawe shal winne the price. And the crow∣ne of fine golde, and saide beware that his fote smite you not, and than
<PB REF="55"/> the other sayde he shall wynne the de∣uil, and an other knight sayd to Rey∣nawde, ye haue wel doone sweet kni∣ght for to haue brought youre horse heere, and if god destineth him: ye shal wynne the pryse this day. Reynawde vnderstoode full well the greate wor∣des that men said to him wherof his here swelled high, that if it had not be for doubt to haue lost the pryce: be wolde haue begon the strife, and ther∣fore he helde his peace, and made no∣ther noise nor worde against it.</P>
<P>THan whan themperoure vn∣derstoode the great wordes y<SUP>t</SUP> the knyghtes sayde to Reynawde: he was wrothe for it, and he said so high that it was well heard of all. I com∣maunde you vpon paine of my grace that ye saye no shame nor yll worde to no maner of knyght. For yf ye doo ye shall anger me sore. But Rey∣nawde cared not much of that it was saide to him. Whan the Duke Nay∣mes and Ogyer sawe that it was ty∣me for to renne: they made to sowne the trompettes. Then euerye man putted hym selfe for to renne, And whan Mawgis sawe that euery man ran: he lighted on foote and vnbound the foote of Bayarde. But or euer he was vnbounde: the other were wel ferre, and whan Reynawde saw that it was tyme for to renne after the o∣ther: he spurred his horse, &amp; said to ba∣yarde, we been ferre behynde ye my∣ght wel abide. For if ye be not soone afore: ye shall be blamed, whan Bay∣arde heard his maister speake thus: he vnderstoode him as well as thoughe he had been a man. Than he grylled his nosethrels and bare his head vp and made a long necke, and tooke his course so fast that it semed the erthe should haue sonken vnder hym, and within a whyle he was passed all the other horses a ferre waye so that men coulde not see him for dust that he rei∣sed. And whan thei that tooke heed to the courses sawe Baiarde ren thus: they were greatly abashed with all, &amp; sayde the one to thother beholde that whyte horse renneth fast and lyght, and but late he halted sore, he is the best of all thother that been heere.</P>
<P>ANd whan themperour sawe this: he called to him Richard of Normandye, and sayde to hym, sawe ye euer so many good horses to¦gither as heere ben now? but y<SUP>e</SUP> whyte passeth them all, God how is he well like baiarde the horse of Reynawde? yf he had the heares of Bayarde: I should saye that it were he hym selfe, and he that sytteth vpon him is also light and prue. ❧ Thus wyte it that Reynawde hath doo so muche that Bayarde hath ouercome all the other horses. And whan he was at the end of the lystes: he tooke the crowne and put it on his arme, and the syluer and the clothe he left alone, for he day∣ned not to take them. And whan he hadde taken the crowne: he returned agayne towarde the kyng Charle∣maine all faire and a soft pace, whan the kynge sawe hym come towarde hym, he sayde to hym all laughyng. Freend abyde a lytle I praye you, for yf ye wyll haue my crowne ye shall haue it, and I shall geue you for your horse so greate hauoyre: that ye shall haue
<PB N="l" REF="55"/> neuer be poore. By God sayde Rey∣nawde these wordes shall nought a∣uayle you, now haue I well begyled you, for I go doo marchaundise els where and I holde you for a chylde. I haue so often angred you &amp; of youre men I haue so many slayne. I am Reynawde that beareth away your crowne, seke els where for a nother horse that ye shall giue to Rowland for to ouercome Baiard, for ye shal not haue bayarde nor also your cro∣wne. And as soone y<SUP>t</SUP> he had said this he spurred bayarde wyth hys spur∣res and went so fast a way that it se∣med that the tempest had chased hī. And whan the kynge Charlemayne vnderstode thys y<SUP>t</SUP> Reynawde had sayd to hym: he was wode angry for it that he wyste not what he should doo so that he myght not of a greate whyle speake a worde. And whan he had recouered his speche: he began to crye with a hye voyce, nowe after lordes after, for it is myne enemye Reynawde the sonne of Aymon.</P>
<P>And whan the knyghtes heard thus crye the kynge Charlemayne: they spurred theyr horses with y<SUP>e</SUP> spurres and went after Reynawde, but their goynge auayled theym nought. For Bayard was ferre from them with in a whyle so y<SUP>t</SUP> they wyst not where he was become, and Reynawde cam to Sayne and passed ouer it al at his ease with swymynge, for Bayarde was well wonte therto, and also he had passed it afore with more great haste. And whā that Reynawde was thus passed the ryuer of Sayne: he lyghted from Bayarde at the banke of it. Thus hanging: the king Char¦lemayne and his knightes that folo¦wed after hym, came to the ryuers syde, and began to call Reynawde &amp; sayd to hym. Ha true man, soone yel∣de me my crowne agayne and I shal gyue thee .x. tymes as muche as it is worthe, and I shall gyue thee tru∣ce two yeres, so that thy selfe and thy brethern shall mow go in ardey∣ne to see your mother the which desi∣reth sore to see you, and there is no knyght in my lande that shal say cō∣trary to it, by god sayd Reynawde as for these wordes auayle you nothīg, for ye shall neuer haue agayne your crowne. I shall sell it and shall pay my knyghtes withall, and the char∣boncle that thus shyneth shal be set hye vpon my pauylyon to the ende that they y<SUP>t</SUP> shall go to saynt Iames in Galyee may see it the better, and ye shall be blamed of your knyghtes that ye haue loste your crowne by the horse Bayarde, whan Charlemayn hearde hym speake thus: he wyst not what he should say for angre, &amp; kept himself styl like as he had ben dead. And whan Reynawde had sayde so: he mounted agayne vpon Bayarde and put hymself to the way, but not the ryght way: but rode throughe a lytle pathe whyche he had passed a∣fore tyme.</P>
<P>NOw shal I tell you of Maw∣gys how he dyd for to come out of Parys y<SUP>t</SUP> was mounted vpon his horse morell. Whan he wyst that Reynawde was passed Sayne he is∣sued out of Parys and passed the ry∣uer ouer the brydge as soone as he might. And whan he was without:
<PB REF="56"/> he began to looke after Reynawde &amp; as he rode he looked a trauerse and sawe Reynawde, so called he after hym as hie as he could, cosyn thinke to ryde fast, for to tary heere no good shall come to vs, cosyn sayde Rey∣nawde ye saye well and we shall doo so. And so they tooke theyr waye to∣warde Myllon. And whan Alarde saw his brother come and Mawgis: he sayd to his folke. Lordes we may well come out of our busshemente, for I se come my brother Reynawde &amp; Mawgys. Alas sayd Richarde I see them come wyth greate haste. I fere me muche that men chase them. Now light we al on horse backe and yf they haue mystre of vs: let vs go helpe and succour them. And they answered all we ben all redy, &amp; whan they came out of theyr busshement: there came Reynawde and Mawgis that sayd to them lordes thynke to make haste. For the longe taryenge might doo to vs harme bicause that I brynge wyth me the crowne of Charlemayne, the whiche Bayarde hath made me wynne by his pro∣wesse. And whan Alarde vnderstode his brother speake thus: he was so greatly in Ioye that he wyste not what he should say but colled &amp; kys∣sed his brother Reynawde w<SUP>t</SUP> greate Ioye. And than incontinēt they put themselfe to the waye and so longe they rode y<SUP>t</SUP> they came to Orleaunce and passed the ryuer of Loyre wyth all dylygence, and after they made so muche by theyr Iourneys: y<SUP>t</SUP> they came to Mountawban whole and glad, thanked be god.</P>
<P>THan whan they were at moū∣tawban: the lady came them agaynst &amp; receyued them right glad∣ly, and made them ryght great there and all the folke of the Castell were ryght glad of the comynge of Rey∣nawde and of hys bretherne, and as∣ked him how he had doone in his vi∣age, lordes sayd Reynawde wel god gramercy. I was knowen of myne hoste y<SUP>e</SUP> whych wolde haue betrayed and accused me, but I solde it to him ful deere, I cloue his head to y<SUP>e</SUP> teeth and went out of hys house by night and put vs in the prese of the other, but ye wyst neuer folke so wel scor∣ned as we were, for the folke of char¦lemayne mocked me and Bayarde, wherof the king was angry, &amp; thus they left me in peace. And whan the trompettes began to blowe for to be¦gyn y<SUP>e</SUP> course: they that should renne departed incontinent, and I bode be hinde well the shotte of a bowe, and I tell you well for certayne, there were well twenty thousande horses. And whan I saw me behynde: I said to Bayarde that it should be great shame to hym yf he abode behynde, but god gramercy and Bayarde I ouer ranne them al. And bare awaye the pryce, and of it I haue brought wyth me the crowne of y<SUP>e</SUP> kynge char∣lemayne wherof he is ful sory. Whā thei of Moūtawban vndestode these wordes: they were ryght glad.

<P>THan sayd the erle of Nantuel, Syr wee shall not goe there at this tyme. Ye know well that that wee ben come out of Spayne but late, wherof we ben yet all we∣rye. And also in this felawshyp ben many princes and barons that haue not ben yet in theyr coūtrey nor seen theyr wiues and children, and ye wil y<SUP>t</SUP>, that we go into Gascoyn vpon the kyng Yon, &amp; vpon the foure sonnes of Aymon: And I tell you that the two woūdes y<SUP>t</SUP> I receyued in Spai∣ne be not yet whole, and therfore we may not goe into Gascoyn at thys tyme.

<PB REF="57"/> to fulfil your commaundement wyth all diligence. Whan the kynge vnderstode these wordes: he was wro¦the and sware by saynte Denys of Fraunce, saying in thys maner, if I should be dyssheryted I shall goe now into Gascoyn, and I shall take wyth me all the younge folke of my hoste: the whiche I shall put in good straye honestly, and I shall gyue thē all that they shall need, thoughe ye should abyde behynde as weke men and feynte. Syr sayd the duke Nay∣mes ye say well, for thys yonge men shalbe ryght glad for to assaye them selfe. Therfore wyll I doo it sayde kyng Charlemayne and so shall the kyng Yon be destroyed, and whan I shall haue Reynawde and hys bre∣thern, and Mawgys the theete takē: I shall departe y<SUP>e</SUP> lande of Gascoyne to these yonge knightes for theyr he∣rytage. This hangyng that the king Charlemayne sayd these wordes: a spye that longed to Reynawde was in thys companye that vnderstode all that sayde is. And whan the spye had hearde all together well: he put hymself to the way, and dyd so much by his Iourneys, y<SUP>t</SUP> he came to moū∣tawban, where he founde Reynawde his brethern, and Mawgys.

<P>My Lorde sayd the spye, wyt it that kyng Charlemayne is greatly wro∣the with kynge yon and agaynst you and against your brethern, &amp; against Mawgys.

Than sayd Reynawde to his folke, be not discouraged of nothing For I shall see how Rowlande and Oliuer shall beare themself agaynst me and mi brethern. And than went Reynawde into the halle. And found his brethern and Mawgys with his knyghtes, and sayd to them. Lordes I brynge you tidynges. Now wyt that the kyng Charlemayne cometh to besyge vs, and bryngeth with him all the puyssaunce of Fraunce.</P>
<P>Nowe let vs thynke to receyue him well, for he shall haue more to doo than he weneth, brother sayd Alarde haue no doubte, for they shalbe well receyued, for as longe that we shall lyue and shal see you ryde vpon bay∣arde: we shall not fayle you, nor wee shal not be a ferde to be taken nor ill handled. For no man aliue is worth you, nother of goodnes nor of pro∣wes.</P>
<P>THys hangyng: Charlemayn was aduysed and thoughte vpon the counsell that the Duke of Nantuel had gyuen to him. And af∣ter he called his folke &amp; sayd to thē. Lordes I gyue you leue, and let you wyt that at Easter I shall holde my counsell generall, and it please you.
<PB REF="58"/> Now keep that ye faile not to come than well apparelled and redy, for I wolde not leaue for nothynge, but y<SUP>t</SUP> I should goe see the kyng Yon.

And also I shal take the crowne of Gascoygne from his hed and I shall make hym come a foote after me begginge his bread. And whan he had sayde these wordes: The barons tooke leaue of Charle∣mayne, and wente into theyr coun∣tryes, but at theyr departing: Char∣lemaine sayd to them. Lordes remē∣bre well your selfe that ye come at y<SUP>e</SUP> terme y<SUP>t</SUP> I haue set. For I swere vnto you that those that shall not come, &amp; yf I euercome agayne from Gascoi∣gne: they shall repente it full sore. Shortly to speake: Rycharde wente into his duchy of Normandye sala∣mon into Bretayne. Godfray into a¦uinion, Hughe the olde and Dyssy∣ers into spayne, and Bretons into Almayne. And all the other eueriche into hys owne countrey.</P>
<P>WHan it was time for to come a¦gayne to the courte at the ter∣me that the kyng Charlemayne had set: euery man made hym selfe redy as well as he coulde for to come to the courte as they were expresselye charged they should doo, fyrst came there Rycharde of Normandye and brought wyth hym manye a noble knyght, and presented hym selfe to∣fore the kynge Charlemayne euyn at saynt Denys. After came Sala∣mon of Bretayne, and brought w<SUP>t</SUP> him of hys barons a fayre company and presented hymselfe to the kynge at saynt Denys. After came Dyssy∣ers of Spayne which brought with him well .x. thousand knightes wel armed, and well garnysshed of vy∣tayles. For in all the hoste of Char∣lemayne was none so well arayed as they were of all thynges. And presented hym self in this maner at saynt Denys vnto the kynge Char∣lemayne. Than came Godfray the Ecle of Auynyon and brought with him all his power and a fayre cōpa∣ny and foyson of vytayle. And pre∣sented him and his folke to the king Charlemayne. And after came Pon¦thus out of Almayne, &amp; brought w<SUP>t</SUP> hym afayre companye of men of ar∣mes. For he had wyth him thē of Is∣lande and of Armony, and wel three thousand archers, the whych for no doubt of death wolde neuer flee frō batayle. And presented hym selfe and hys felawship to the kyng char∣lemayne, the whiche he receyued ry∣ght honourably. Than after came the good bisshop Turpin, and brou∣ght wyth hym a fayre company and well enewred to the warre, and pre∣sented hymself to the kynge Charle∣mayne, that was ryght glad of hys comyng, for the bysshop was a good true man. And y<SUP>e</SUP> king Charlemaine trusted muche to hym for his great fydelitie, and also for the great pro∣wes that was in hym.</P>
<P>AL the great Lordes that hel∣de theyr landes of the kyng
<PB N="liii" REF="58"/> Charlemayne came to Parys &amp; pre∣sented themselfe and theyr men to y<SUP>e</SUP> kynge Charlemayne that receyued them with great Ioye and was glad to see aboute hym so fayre a compa∣nye of good men of warre, but I tel you that whan the hoste was assem∣bled at Parys: there was so great a derth that it was great pitie, for the rasour of where was solde for four∣ty shelynges and twenty pence and yf the kynge had taried there any lē∣ger. there should haue ben so greate a derth that all the small people had ben all dead for hūgre. But the king Charlemayne began for to make hys mustres, for to know how much people that he had. And whan the the mustres were made: they found that they were well .xxx. thousande knyghtes that had theyr fyrst berdes besyoe the olde knyghtes that were well an hundred thousand. And whā that this was doone: the Empe∣rour Charlemayne called Rowland his neuew afore him and sayde to hym. Fayre neuew I recomende to you myne hoste, and I pray you that ye wyll conduyte it by good maner. Syr sayd Rouland I shal doo ther∣in my deuoyre after my power. Thā made to be take to hym the oryflam∣be, and departed out of Parys, and they did so muche by smal Iourneis that they came to Bloye, and than Charlemayne made to be cryed that all the vytaylers of the land should goe wyth vitayle after the hoste. And yf that they brought that were worth a peny: they should haue two for it. And whan that thys greate armye was come to Bloy they passed ouer Gyronde and wente afore the great castell of Mountawban. And they lodged themself there rounde about the place. And then the Frenche mē began to say the one to the other, by myne othe there is a fayre castel and a stornge and but yf wee get some o∣ther parte, heere shall we wynne but a lytle.</P>
<P>ANd whan the batayles were ordeyned rounde about moū¦tawban: Rowland began for to say to the kynge Charlemayne. Syr me semeth that wee should nowe gyue a sawte to Mountawban. And the Kynge answered, I wyll not that my folke haue any dommage, but fyrste I wyll knowe yf the castel wil holde or yelde vp. For yf he wyl be gyuen vp: I wolde not that anye batayle should be doone to it. And than incō¦tinent he sent a knyght mounted v∣pon a mewle all vnarmed, the why∣che came vnto the gate of the castel, and whan they y<SUP>t</SUP> kept the gate sawe that it was a messanger: they ope∣ned to hym the gate, and the Knight entred into the castel. And as he was come in, he found the stewarde with an hundred men that wente aboute visitynge the watches and the war∣des. Incotinente the knyght salued hym, and the stewarde rendred hym agayne hys salute and sayd to him. What be ye Gentylman, and what seke you heere wythin? I pray you tell me what folke are yonder wythout so fayre a company. Syr sayde the knyght they ben the folke of the Emperour Charlemaine that is come for to besyege the Castell of
<PB REF="59"/> Mountawban, and I am one of his knyghtes that am come heere for to speake with Reynawde from y<SUP>e</SUP> king Charlemayne. Than the stewarde tooke the knyght by the hande and led him before Reynawde the sonne of Aymon. And whan y<SUP>e</SUP> knyght saw Reynawde: he made reuerence to him and after sayd to hym, Reynawde y<SUP>e</SUP> Emperour Charlemayne sendeth to you worde by me, that yf you wyll yelde your selfe to hys mercy, &amp; giue to hym your brother Richarde to doo his wyll of hym: he shall haue mercy of you. And yf ye wyll not doo so: he shall doo sawte your Castell, and yf he maye take you by force: he shall make you for to be hanged, or dye a cruell death.</P>
<P>THan whā Reynawde vnder∣stode these tydynges y<SUP>t</SUP> Char∣lemayne sente to hym: he began for to sm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le and sayd. Freende go tel the kynge that I am not the man y<SUP>t</SUP> shal doo any treasō. For if I should doo it, he him self should blame me for it. But and yf it please hym, my bre∣therne. Mawgys and my self ben at his commaundement, and we shall gyue our se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to hym as to our so∣uerayne Lorde, our l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ues saue and our membres, and we shall yelde to hym the Castel al at hys wyll. And tell the kynge that he shall doo well and wysely to take such fyue knygh∣tes as we ben. And yf Charlemayn refuseth this: I haue myne hope so fast to our Lorde god that wee shall not set moche by the kynge, nor of his great hoste. The messanger vn∣derstode well the answere that Rey∣nawde had doone to hym: and incon∣tynent he retourned to Charlemain and shewed to hym all y<SUP>t</SUP> Reynawde had sayd worde by worde. Whan the Emperour vnderstode the wordes of Reynawde: he began for to thynke a good whyle, for he knew that Rey∣nawde sayde but well, And than he sent for the Duke Naymes and O∣gier the Dane and sayd vnto them. Lordes, Reynawde sēdeth me worde that he shall doe nothynge after my wyll. And for this cause I wyl that the castell be assayled forthwith. Sir sayd the duke Naymes me semeth as I haue vnderstande y<SUP>e</SUP> Reynawde offreth to you fayre, and yf ye wyll belyue me: ye shall take hym to mer∣cy wyth hys brethern. For ye knowe well that they bē folke that may doo to you good seruyce. And yf Rey∣nawde be once in peace with you: ye shall be the better beloued and more dred therfore. But sith that your wil cannot accorde to the same: we maye not doo therto. To assayle the castel I counsel it not. For ye see that the Castell is fayre and ryght stronge, and Reynawde hath whym a good company of good men, and he and his brethern, &amp; Mawgys ben suche knyghtes as ye knowe, yf ye doo assayle the castel: they shall yssue out at the fauce posternes, and shall doo to you so great a dommage of your folke y<SUP>t</SUP> ye shall be wrothe for it, but and yf ye wyll beleue my counsell: ye shall besyege the Castell so nyghe that no man shal not come out nor cutre in but he shalbe take, and thus ye shall mow haue the Castell by fa∣misshynge. For by no sawte ye shall
<PB N="liv" REF="59"/> not haue it.</P>
<P>CHarlemayne vnderstode well these wordes and knew well that the duke Naymes spake wel &amp; wysely and sayd to hym. I wil that it be doone thus as ye haue deuysed it. And thā he made crye through his hoste y<SUP>t</SUP> euery man should lodge hym∣self euyn nighe by the Castell, and he himselfe commaunded that his pa∣uyllion should be pight as nighe the gate as coulde be doone. After thys was cryed ye should haue seen wyth in a litle whyle moe than ten thou∣sand pauillions rounde aboute the Castell of Mountawban. Whan the hoste was al lodged: Rowlande de∣parted out of the hoste well with two thousand knightes wel armed &amp; wel horsed and all yonge men of pryme berde, whiche were very frenshe born of the douce fraunce, and went at y<SUP>e</SUP> other side of Moūtawban, in a place whiche is called Balancon where was a riuer great and deape, in the whych was fisshe ynough, and there he dyd pytche his pauillion. And so full he was of great pryde: that he bad set the dragon aboue vpon hys pauillion, and did doo make the lod∣gis of his felawes roūde about him And they were in suche a grounde where as they myght see from thens the woodes and the Ryuers and all the countrey, and Mountaw∣ban that was vpon the great roche well closed, &amp; behelde the two great ryuers, that is to wit Gyround and Dordone, that enuyronned Moun∣tawban.</P>
<P>ROwlande sawe the place so stronge that he meruaylled greatly, &amp; sayd to hys folke. Lordes I meruayle me sore of thys castell, &amp; I meruayle not yf the foure sonnes of Aymō make warre agaynst mine vncle Charlemayne sythe that they haue so good and so stronge a place, for to withdraw theym selfe. For I promyse you that Moūtawban shal neuer be taken of vs, ye say not well sayd Olyuer. For we tooke well by force Lezonne, &amp; also we ouerthrew downe the great towre and the doun¦geon of Sernoble, wherof I saye y<SUP>t</SUP> we shall well haue Mountawban, And yf Reynawde and his bretherne come not and yelde them selfe: they shalbe in daunger of death. I pro∣myse you sayde Rowlande that they shall doo nothynge of that ye saye. For I promyse you that the gentyll Reynawde shall make vs so sore a∣ferde that the moste hardy wolde be at Parys. Reynawde is prue and coragious, and his brethern in lyke¦wise, and also they haue within y<SUP>e</SUP> ca∣stell many noble and worthy knigh∣tes. Wherfore I say and I am of opi¦nion, that as lōge as they haue vy∣tayle they shall neuer be taken. Whā y<SUP>e</SUP> pauillion of Rowlande was dres∣sed and pight vp: Rowlande behelde the riuer and saw that it was full of byrdes, than he sayd to the Bysshop Turpyn and to the other Barons, See howe wee are lodged in a good place. Let vs goe in these Ryuers to let flee our Fawcons. Syr sayde the Bisshoppe Turpin, goe in the name of God. Then lyghted Row∣lande on horsebacke and tooke with
<PB REF="60"/> hym wel .xxx. knightes, and no mo. And they tooke their hawkes, &amp; rode the moste parte of them vpon mu∣les all vnarmed saue theyr swerdes and came and sported them alonge the ryuer syde, &amp; tooke many byrdes vpon the water, in so great quantitie that they laded a horse wythall, the bysshop Turpyn and Ogyer, wente not there but abode behynde for to keep the hoste, and they were before y<SUP>e</SUP> tentes where they made two aunci∣ent knightes to recoūte and tel how the great Troy was taken and dy∣stroyed, this hangyng: was a spye in the hoste of king Charlemaine, that longed vnto renawde, the whyche he had sent there for to know what they wrought, and howe they dyd &amp; all the fayte of Rowlande, and incō∣tinent the spye departed out of the hoste and wente to Reynawde, and shewed to hym how Rowlande and Olyuer were gone to sportynge w<SUP>t</SUP> theyr Hawkes vpon the ryuer, and wyth them thyrtye of the best of the hoste.</P>
<P>WHan the spye had recoun∣ted these tidynges to Rey∣nawde: he was of it ryght glad. Than he called his brethern &amp; Mawgys his cosyn, &amp; tolde them how Roulande and Olyuer and .xxx of the beste barons of Charlemayne were gone to hawking vpon the ry∣uers in the plaine of Balancō. What ought we to doo sayd Reynawde? Cosyn sayd Mawgys we may well kill thē if we wyll, for they ben well proude &amp; folyshe, remēbre ye not wel that a messāger tolde you a moneth a goe that Charlemayne had left all olde knightes of his Realme, &amp; had taken of the yonge, &amp; that he had de∣parted all Gascoyne to the yonge ba¦chelers of Fraunce? And by thys bo∣ban Rowland &amp; Olyuer ben moun∣ted into so great pryde that they trow in al the worlde is no man that dare assaile them nor looke vpon them an grely. But and yf ye wyl beleue me: I shall tell you suche a thynge, that shal make them wrothe &amp; sory. And thā reinawde made sowne his horne y<SUP>e</SUP> which mē neuer herde sowned but y<SUP>t</SUP> it was need, for whan men hearde it: euery man ran to his armes for to arme hym. And incontynent Rey∣nawde and his bretherne, and Maw¦gys made themselfe to be armed.</P>
<P>And whan they were al armed and well apparelled: Reynawde lyghted vpon Bayarde his good horse, and spurred hym wyth hys spurres, so that he made hym to lepe wel thyrty foote of length. Ha good horse sayd Reynawde: how ye make your selfe to be beloued. And how wel I mistre you this dai. Let vs go assayle these vnhappy folke of the kyng Charle∣mayne of Fraunce, and make we by suche a maner that we need not re∣tourne twyse, and therof I praye you all.</P>
<P>ANd whan Reynawde sawe that his folke was wel appa∣relled, he wente out with his men at a false posterne, that they of the hoste coulde not see them. And they were wel in his cōpany about foure thousand well horsed and well ar∣med, And a foster conduyted them
<PB N="lv" REF="60"/> throughe the thyckest of the forest, &amp; Reynawde sayd to the foster, brynge me thou into the hoste of Rowland without fayle, the Foster answered to hym that he wolde doo it gladly. Than brought he them streyght to Balancon. And whan Reynawde sawe the pauylions: he shewed them to his folke, to whome he sayde, be holde what fayre gayne wee haue founde heere yf wee dare set vpon them. Syr sayd his men, let vs goe to it hardelye, for we durste well as∣sayle the deuyl, whan ye be with vs. ¶ Nowe shall I tell you of the bys∣shop Turpin that was a bid to keep the hoste, wherof he had great feare bycause he wyst well agaynst whom he had a doo, and had a great suspec¦cion and heaued vp hys head, &amp; saw the Rauens &amp; the Dawes flee about vpon the fortresse. And from thens they tooke theyr flyght ouer Rowlā∣des pauilion. And made great noise And so was he aferde, for he wende that it had be some euyll token, and he behelde towarde the woodes that were great, and saw anon hys ene∣myes, wherof he was sore afrayde y<SUP>t</SUP> almoste he was besyde hymselfe.</P>
<P>Than he called Ogyer the Dane and sayd to hym, free knyght for goddes loue goe arme your selfe, and let our folke be armed, for heere comen our enemyes. Now ben well Rowlande and Olyuer gone for nought that ar gone to the chase and haue left theyr hoste thus in great daūger. I beleue that thei shal not fayle but they shal repente it sore. Whan Ogyer hearde Turpyn speake in thys maner: he was very sore an angred, so went he in his pauylion and made hym to be armed incontynent for to moue the hoste. And whan that the Frenche∣men hearde the trumpettes blowe: they put themself in ordenaūce no∣bly. Thys hanging: Ogyer was ar∣med and mounted vpon hys horse Brayforde, and founde that a great parte of them was armed and al re∣dye. Than Ogier said to them Lor∣des thynke to defende you well, for we ben assayled.</P>
<P>REynawde was abashed whan he sawe the hoste that moued so: and sayde vnto hys folke, Lordes we ben dyscouered, but yet neuerthe∣lesse let vs go to it and assayle them they answered that they were all re∣dy for to doo so. And whan that Rei∣nawde vnderstode these wordes: he sayde vnto Mawgys. Fayre Cosyn take a thousande knyghtes, and a∣bide heere within this wood. And if yee see that we need of more helpe: come than and succoure vs. Gladly sayde Mawgys your commaunde∣mente shalbe do one. And whā that Reynawde had sayde so: he spurred Bayarde with his spurres, &amp; wente into the hoste, &amp; passed the playne of Balancon, &amp; the fyrst that he recoū∣tred it was Emery the erle of Nicol, and smote hym so that he shoued his speare thoroughe the bodye of him and fell dead to the erth. Then sayd Reynawde ye shal abye y<SUP>e</SUP> bargayne. false Glotton, ye dyd a greate folye whan ye came euer into Gascoygne And whan that he had sayde thus: he set hys hande to his swerde. And began for to make so great occysyon
<PB REF="61"/> of knightes that none can tel it. And whan Reynawde saw his enemies so strongelye abasshed: He began for to say, where is Rowlande and O∣lyuer that so sore hath thretened me and my folke, and saying that we bē traytours? But and they saye so a∣fore me: I should shew to them that they say not well nor trouth. Whan the bisshop Turpyn vnderstode this that Reynawde sayde: He sayde to Reynawde, ye nother saye well nor trouth, and thā he spurred his horse with the spurres, and went agaynst Reynawde, and gaue eche other so great strokes through theyr sheeldes that they brake bothe theyr speres al in peces. But neyther of theym fell downe. And whan Reynawde had broken his spere: he set his hande to his swerd and gaue so great a stroke with it to the Bisshop Turpyn vpō his helme that he made bothe the mā and the horse to rele sore. And whan Reynawde saw y<SUP>e</SUP> bisshop in y<SUP>e</SUP> plight he sayd to him, father be ye the same Turpyn that prayseth your selfe so sore? By my faith me semeth it were better for you to be in some churche to synge some masse then for to be heere, wening to greue me.</P>
<P>THan whan the bysshop Tur∣pyn vnderstode the reproche that Reynawde made to hym: he tro¦wed well to haue gone oute of hys mynde for it. And set handes to hys swerde, &amp; went vpō Reynawde. And then was the hoste moued of one partye and of the other. Shortly to speke: there were so many speres bro¦ken, so many a knyght ouerthrowen and so mani horses dead: that it was great pitie for to see. There was O∣gyer the Dane that had his sheeld a∣fore hys brest, and his swerde in his hand and sat vpon Brayforde the whych smote Rycharde the brother of Reynawde so great a stroke: that his horse fell downe to therth. Whā Rycharde sawe hym selfe a ground: he rose vp agayne quickely as a kni∣ght prue and valyaunt. And tooke his swerde in his hande, and Ogier passed beyonde for to folow his cour∣se and began to crye the baner saynt Denis. Whā Reynawde saw his bro∣ther Rycharde cast on groūd: he was wrothe for it. So spurred he hys horse Bayarde, and went agaynste Ogyer the dane, &amp; Ogier against hī. &amp; gaue eche other great strokes vpō theyr sheeldes. Reynawde smote O∣gyer by so great force that the horses gyrth nor y<SUP>e</SUP> peytrell myght not help But that Ogier muste falle downe sadle and all to the grounde.</P>
<P>WHan Reynawde saw Ogier at the erth: he tooke Bray∣forde by the brydle, and sayde to O∣gier, ye haue doone euyll for to haue caste downe my brother afore me, ye knowe that ye be of my lignage and my cosyn nyghe, ye should helpe and defende vs agaynst all men. And ye doo worse than the other, wherof I say it is no dede of a cosyn but of an enemi, neuerthelesse take your horse agayne vpon suche condicion that ye shall doo to me a pleasure at a no∣ther time if I haue need, the why∣che thinge God forbede, cosyn sayde Ogyer ye speake as a good mā, and
<PB N="lvi" REF="61"/> promise you that yf I fayle of this, that ye saye: god punysshe me for it, Reynawde yeelded him agayne hys horse, and helde the styrop to Ogyer whan he lyghted agayne vpon hys horse brayforde. And wyt it that Ogyer sich dyd muche for Reynawd and yeelded hym again vpon his re∣ward at the roche mountbron, wher¦of he was rebuked of Charlemaine shamefully. Whan Ogier was sette on his horse again: he set hand to hys swerde &amp; entred amonge the thickest of the gascoines, &amp; began to hew thē so sore that he made them all to slee afore him. Whan Mawgis saw that all the battaylles were thus medled togither: he cam out of the wood, and came to Balancon and put himselfe &amp; his folke among the greatest prece and began to cleaue and hew so hard heades legges and armes, that none durste abyde longe afore him. And than the frenshmen were so sore and werye that they mighte no more and were all dyscomfited at the passage of the ryuer, than they dyd put theym selfe to flight, and the gascoines cha∣sed them all beating a longe mile, &amp; after returned to the hoste, and tooke al the hauoyr that they founde there, and Mawgis came to the pauillion of Rowland and tooke the dragon of golde that was set vpon the said pa∣uillion, and they passed through Ba∣lancon, and so returned to Moūtaw∣ban with greate ioye. And whā they were come: there they disarmed them selfe &amp; eate right wel. For they had well mister therof. Whan they hadde caten at their ease: Reinawde made brynge the boty afore him. And after dealed it among his folke. And keepe to him no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> one peny. Whan Reinawd had thus departed all this goodes: Mawgis went vpon the great tow∣re of Mountawban. And dyd set the dragon of Rowland vpon the same, so that the folke of choste of bothe si∣des of the castell myghte see it. And whan Charlemaine saw the dragon vpon the towre of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ountawban: he wende that Rowland his neuew had taken Mountawban by force, but the thinge went wel otherwise. For Reinawde and his bretherne had discomfited al the folke of Rowland and had brought with them al theyr hauoyre and the dragon of the sayde Rowland they had set vpon the tow∣re of Mountawban.</P>

<P>NOw must we tel of Rowland and of Oliuer, that came a∣gaine fro hawking vpon the riuers wyth theyr felowes, and beseming they were ryghte gladde that they hadde so well chased and taken a greate quantitie of byrdes, and thus as they came againe: they met wyth damp Rambault the free knight that tolde them by a great angre, ye haue taken manye byrdes see that ye be good marchauntes &amp; selle your proy well. For I promyse you ye shall ne∣uer selle your chase and hawking so deare as it hath coste you. And yf ye haue taken byrdes: I let you wyt that Reinawde &amp; his brethern haue taken knyghtes, and horses, and whan ye see youre dragon vpon the greate towre of Mountawban, ye oughte wel to be than glad &amp; thanke muche therof the foure sonnes of Ai∣mon. For all tho that seen it set there of an heyght: they ween that ye haue gotten the castell by force. Whan Rowland vnderstood these wordes: it lacked lityll that he went oute of hys mynde, he lyghted downe from hys mule, and sette hymselfe vpon a stone, and begā to thinke and muse sore, and so dyd Oliuer in lyke wise, and whan Rowlande had thoughte ynoughe: he called to him the byshop Turpyn, Ogier the dane, &amp; Richard of Normandye and sayd to theym. For god fayre lordes what counseyll gyue you me vpon thys deed? For I dare neuer mote finde my selfe before my vncle the kyng Charlemayne, for I feare me to sore of euyll reporte
<PB N="lvii" REF="62"/> and that menne tell of me otherwyse than the trouth. And he said to the byshop Turpyn. For goddes loue good father in god geue me leaue to departe, for I wolde goe into the holy londe to see the sepulture of our lorde for to warre there ayenst the sarasins For sith this my shappe is thus come to me: I wyl no more beare armes a∣yenst christen men. Syr sayde the by∣shop Turpyn, be not dysmayed for nothinge, for thys is but an vse of warre, suche a thyng befalleth often to manye one, I promise you that ye shall haue or three dayes been past: as many of the folke of Reynawde as he hathe of yours. Sir said Row∣lande ye geue me good courage and I promise you that to your prudence I shall arrest my selfe. Whan Row∣land had said these woordes: the bys∣shop Turpyn &amp; Ogier dyd so muche that thei made him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight a horseback and they went togither all towarde Charlemayn, &amp; wit that after Row∣lande came mo than a hundred yonge gentilmen all a foote by cause they had lost their horses, and whan they were come to thoste of Charlemain: they went streyghte to the pauyllion of the duke Naimes, and whan Row¦land entred within he was ashamed and abode there two dayes that he came not out, &amp; durste not goe to the courte nor loke no mā in the face but helde himselfe in the saide pauillyon as a man all abashed of the great so∣rowe that he had at his heart. Whan Rowland &amp; Olyuer was thus abidē in the duke Naymes tent, this han∣gyng: Turpyn came towarde kinge Charlemayne in hys rente. Where he entred within &amp; saluted the kyng right honourably, and the emperour rendred to him his sau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and after sayd to him. Damp byshop ye be welcome. Syr said Turpyn god be your keeper, &amp; I beseche you to pardō me, yf I tell you any thing that shal displease you. Now tel har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y said the king what ye wyll. For nothing that ye can tell, canne not dysplease me. Syr sayde the byshop Turpyn, wyt that the foure sonnes of Aymon haue discomfyted vs. And haue take with them al that we had in our ten∣tes, bothe horses and harneys and al our pauyllyons and namely the dra∣gon of Rowland beside a greate m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣ny prisoners, and they haue slain the moste party of our folke.</P>
<P>THan whā the emperour vn∣derstoode this that Turpyn had tolde him: he was a long while as a man all forcened. And than he sware saint Denys by greate angre, and said. Now haue ye found that ye went telling &amp; the great pride that ye had ye haue wel found. At this hou∣re he did send through al his hoste by expresse wordes: that euery lorde and baron should come incontinent afore him in his tente for he wolde keep parlyament with them. Whan the prynces knew that commaundemēt of the king: ye should haue seen them come with greate haste toward the king, and whan they were all assem∣bled within the kinges pauillion: he stoode vpon his feete &amp; said to theim in this maner. Lordes I haue sent for you for to shewe vnto you tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to vs is happed of newe.

<PB REF="63"/> that the four sonnes of Aimon haue discomfited all youre knightes that Rowlande my neuew had with him at Balancon, wherof I am ryghte wroth and sorye, for I wolde I had lost a greater thinge, and that thys were not happed, but a thyng that can not be amended: must be suffred and borne as well as men may, I re∣quire and beseche you all my lordes and freendes vpon the othe that ye haue made to me: that ye will coun∣seyll me truelye howe I shall be ru∣led in thys matter, and howe I myghte haue thys Castell of Moun∣tawban, whan the kinge had thus spoken: there was none so hardye that euer durste saye one worde but onely the Duke Naymes of Bauier the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and wyse knyght. Syr said the Duke Naymes, ye aske counsell for to besyege Mountawban, but no manne that hathe any reason in his heade: oughte not to counseyll you the same, for whye the daunger is there greate because that Guynard the lorde of Berne knoweth of it, and so dooth Godfray the Lorde of Poycy that are good knightes and sore dread for theyr worthynes, and also the kinge yon that is at tholou∣se, the whiche shall come all to helpe and succour Reinawd: by cause they be of his aliaūce, and also they know that he is one of the best knyghtes of the worlde. And they knowe well also that Reynawd gyueth to vs mu∣che to doone, and so I tell you if they see themselfe togyther: they shal giue you ynoughe to doo, and shall maye beare to you a great dommage. But and ye wil haue good counseyll, and beleue me: I shal gyue it to you true∣lye. Syr sende worde to kynge yon, that he withdraw not nor keep your enmyes within hys londe, but that he yeeld them in to youre handes for to doo with them youre pleasure and your commaundemente. And yf he wyll not doo so: ye shall destroye all his londe and no mercy ye shall haue vpon him. Naymes saide the kynge, nowe gyue you me good counseyll, and I wyll that ye haue saide: be doone incontynente. Than the kyng made come an Heraude of hys, and sayde to hym. Nowe goe lyghtlye to Tholouse, and tell kynge yon on my behaulfe that I am entred in to Gas∣coyne accompanyed of the twelue peeres of Fraunce with an hundred thousand fyghting menne, and with Rowlande, and Olyuer, and telle hym that by saynt Denys of fraunce yf he yeelde me not my enmyes, that been the foure sonnes of Aymon: that I shall waste and destroye all hys londe, nor to hym shall abyde nother cytie nor Castell, but it shal be ouer throwen to the earth. And yf I canne take hym: I shall take from him hys crowne, so shall he be called kynge ouerthrowen. Syr sayde the Heraude your commaun∣dement I shall doo without varying of one word, euen as your good grace pleaseth to commaunde me, and thus departed the Heraude from the hoste of Charlemayne, and tooke hys way towarde Tholouse, there he founde the king yon of Gascoyn in his pal∣lays with a right fayre company, &amp; assone that he saw the king: he knew hym well, so made he than to hym
<PB N="lviii" REF="63"/> the reuerence, and said to him in the Emperours behalfe the thing worde by worde wherof he was sent there.</P>
<P>ANd whan the kyng yon vnder∣stoode the Heraude that spake so: he bowed hys head towarde the earthe, and began to thinke a longe while, and said not a word. And whā he had thus longe mused ynoughe: he said to the messāger. Good freend ye muste cary heere a seuen nyght I praye you, and than I shall tell you my wyl, and what I purpose to doo. Syr saide the Heraude I shall abyde with a good will sith that it please you. Than wente the king yon in to hys chambre and eyght earles with him, and cōmaunded that the doores should be well sheete, and than they set theim all vpon a benche. And whan they were al set: the kyng yon tooke the worde and said in this ma∣ner. Lordes I beseche and require v∣pon the faith that ye owe to me that ye geue me good counseyll to the ho∣noure of me, not at my will: but by reason. Nowe wit it that the kynge Charlemain is entred within my lōd with the tuelue peeres of Fraunce, and Rowlande and Oliuer, with an hundred thousande men. And he sen∣deth to me word, but if I deliuer vn∣to him the four sonnes of Aimon: he shall not leaue me nother citie nor towne, but he shal cast all to chearth and shal take the crown fro my head, and so shal I becalled a kinge ouer∣throwen. My father helde neuer no∣thing of him and no more shal I, it is better to die with great worship: than to liue in great shame.</P>
<P>THan whan the king you had thus spoken: there rose vp a knight named Godfraye that was neuew to king yon and sayd to him, sir I merueyll me that ye aske coun∣seyll for to betray suche knightes as ben the foure sonnes of Aimon, Rei∣nawde is your man and your carnall freend, ye know what good he hath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> doone to you and to your londe. It is not longe a goe that he dyscomfited Marcyl the puysaunt Sarasin and chased him well foure mile, and smot of his heade and presented it to you, and ye haue promysed and sworne to him that ye shal defend and keep him him ayenst all menne. Mine vncle if ye thynke to faylle him and wil not holde that ye haue promised to him: let him and his bretherne goe out of your londe in to some other countrie to seeke theyr aduenture. And hapely they shall serue some lorde that shal doo to them more good then ye wyll doo, and also I praye you my deare lord and vncle as much as I cā: that ye wil doo nothing that turneth you to blame, nor to dyshonour, nor that can be caste by maner of reproche to∣ward your freendes. Than spake the olde earle of Ansom and said. Sir ye wil that we giue you counseill, yf ye wil doo that we shal counseil you: ye shal doo wel for your selfe. Now say on hardely said the king that semeth you best to be doo, for I wyll doo as ye shall counseyll me. Syr sayde the earle ye haue wel heard saye, and so it was trouth, that Benes slew the earle Lohier, wherfore Charlemaine sente for him and made hys head to be smyten of at Parys, and at that
<PB REF="64"/> time Reinawd and his brethern we∣re verye yonge, and of them was no∣ne mencyon made. And afterwarde whan they were great: the kyng wold amende it to them. For the thynge toucheth them, but they had the hert so fell that they wolde take none a∣mendes, and lasted theyr hate longe, wherof euer syth hathe come greate harmes and euylles. For Reynawde slewe Berthelot the neuewe of the king with a chesse borde, sir I know not why I shoulde hyde anye thynge fro your knowledge, ye knowe well that Charlemaine is so myghtye a kyng that he neuer vndertooke wan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but he came to his aboue of it. Wher∣fore I doo geue you counseyll that ye yeelde Reinawde and hys brethern and Mawgis to the kynge Charle∣mayne, and thus shall ye be delyue∣red of a greate thoughte, and of a greate daunger. And after thys: spa∣ke the erle of Mobandes and sayde, syr yf ye wil doo this that the erle of Ansom counseilleth you: yee and we shall be traytours. For Reynawd is your man, and so muche ye haue lo∣ued him that ye haue giuen hym your sister to his wife. And whan he came in these marches, he came not lyke a knaue: but he came to you as a noble knighte prue and worthye. For he brought in his felawship foure thou∣sande men well armed and well hor∣sed, and said to you afore vs all ore∣uer he tooke of his spurres, that he had warre with the kinge Charle∣main. Neuerthelesse ye receiued him with good herte, and after made of him at your wil. And for you he con∣quested mani batailles, &amp; did so much that he delyuered you from the han∣des of your enemyes. And therfore syr I tell you that ye be not worthye to calle your self, ne to bere the crow∣ne vpon youre heade: if for feare of death ye betray such knightes as are the foure sonnes of Aymon. For ye haue not yet loste nother Castell nor town, &amp; if ye doo it otherwise: ye shal be taken and holden for a traytoure. After spake Anthony the olde earle &amp; sayde to the kinge. Syr beleue not this counseyll, for suche counseyll he gyueth you now wherof ye shall be betrayed at the last. For I know bet∣ter then tent of Reinawde than anye man that is heere, ye must vnderstō∣de sir that Reynawd was sonne to a mā that had but one town, and was so proude that he dayned to serue nor obeye his lorde the king of Fraunce but slewe Berthelot by his great pri∣de and outrage. Wherfore the kynge Charlemaine chased hym out of the realme of Fraunce. Nowe it is hap∣ped so that he is in Gascoygne, and ye haue gyuen to hym great landes, and because he hathe youre syster to wife: he is become so proude that none maye dure afore hym. And he setteth not a peny nother by you nor by your courte. Wherfore I swere to you by y<SUP>e</SUP> head that I beare, if he may by any wise he shal take the life from you for to haue all the realme to him selfe. Wherfore I aduyse to you by rightwise counsell: that ye yeeld him and his bretherne to Charlemayne. And ye shall doo as a wise king, and so shall you pease the great wrath of the kyng Charlemayne of Fraunce. After spake the duke Guymarde of
<PB N="lix" REF="64"/> Bayon and sayd to the kynge. Syr I tell you that the earle Anthony ly∣eth falsly, and giueth you euill coun∣seyll, for Reynawde as sonne to the duke Aimon of Ardeine, which is of ryght great lygnage. And Charle∣mayne made to slea the duke Benes of Aygremount their vncle by great wronge, and Reynawd tooke therof vengeaunce vpon Berthelot by good reason, and that more is: it was his body defendinge. Wherof I tell you that no kinge is not worthye to beare any crowne nor to haue honour that wil do treason for thretening of a no∣ther lorde. And after spake Humarb an olde knighte and sayde. By god Guymard I beleue that ye haue los<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your wit, to counseill the kinge you for to beare out Reinawd, ayenst the great king Charlemain, for to make al the lond of Gascoyne for to be de∣stroied, wherof ye should care but li∣tell, if the realme were wasted and the king brroughte to shame, so that ye had laude and praising. Than said Guimard thou liest falsly, and if we two were in an other place than here: I should shew thee that thou were an olde doterd and a foole. For I wolde not coūseyl the king yon, but al thing that concerneth his honour, and pro∣fite also of his realme.</P>
<P>AFter spake one named sir hec∣tor, an auncient earle &amp; said to the king. Sir ye aske counseyl of suche that can not counsell theim selfe. For it is all otherwyse thenne Guymarde saith. And I ensure you that if ye lose in this matter: he shal lese therby nothyng. Syr ye knowe that Reynawde is a knyghte good y∣noughe. But by his greate pryd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: he hath made warre with Charlemain For he slewe Berthelot his neuewe by his outrage. Now he is come in Gascoygne, and ye haue gyuen him your sister in maryage, wherof ye dyd great foly, and ye made hym the castel of Mountawban vpon the strō¦gest grounde that is within youre realm. Now is come the king Char∣lemain that hath besieged him, wher∣fore I counseyll you that ye accorde with the kynge Charlemain, and de∣liuer your selfe of Reynawd as son∣ne as ye may. For it is better that ye lese foure knightes, than al your real∣me, take from him your sister and gi∣ue her to another that is a greater gentilman than is Reinawde, and that haue no suche enemyes as is Charlemaine, and fynde some mea∣nes to yeelde Reynawde and his bre∣therne to the king Charlemain. And this ye shall well may doo wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hout blame yf ye wil doo that I shal coū∣sell you. Freend said the king yon. I am ready to doo that whiche ye shall coūseil me aboue al other y<SUP>t</SUP> ben heere</P>
<P>THan whan the kinge yon of Gascoigne saw that y<SUP>e</SUP> moste party of his counseil accorded to that he shoulde yeelde Reinawde and his brethern to king Charlemyane he be∣gan to weep right tenderly, and said in him self that no body could here it, by god Reinawd I am sore charged for you, nowe shall departe my loue for you, for ye shall lese the body, &amp; I shal lese therby y<SUP>e</SUP> loue of god &amp; of his
<PB REF="65"/> mother, for I shal neuer fynde mercy in hym, for to be tray suche a knyght as ye be. But I tell you that GOD shewed that day for Reinawde a fay∣re miracle, for the chambre where the coūsell was kept that was al white: chaunged colour &amp; became al blacke as a cole. Lordes sayde the kynge yon, I see well that I muste yeelde the foure sonnes of Aimon, syth that the most parte of you accordeth ther∣to, and I shall doo it, sith that that ye counseyl me so. But I wot wel that my soule shall neuer haue therof no pardon. And shall be therfore taken all my life as a Iudas, and than they left the counseyll, and went oute of the chambre. And whan the kynge was come out of the chambre: he set him downe vpon a benche, and be∣gan to thinke sore. And as he was in this thought: he began for to weep sore for greate pitie that he had. And whan he hadde thoughte and wepte ynoughe: he called his secretary, and saide to him. Come forthe syr Peter and write a letter frō me to the kīg Charlemaine, as I shall tell you. It is that I sende him salutacion with good loue. And yf he wyll leaue me my londe in peace: I promyse hym that afore ten dayes been passed. I shall deliuer vnto him the foure son∣nes of Aymon and he shal find them in the playne of Valcolours, clothed with scarlet, futred with ermynes, and rydynge vpon mules, betynge in their handes floures, and Roses for a token, for because that menne shall better knowe them. And I shal make theym for to be accompanyed of eyghte earles of my realme, and if they scape from him: that he blame me not for it. Than sayde the secre∣tory, syr your commaundement shall be doone, the whiche tooke anon pen and ynke and wrote the letters word for worde as the king had deuised to hym. And when they were wryten and sealed: the kynge called hys stu∣arde and sayde to hym. Now make you ready on horsebacke, and goe to the syege of Mountawban, and re∣comende me vnto the kinge Charle∣mayne, and gyue hym these letters. And tell him yf he wyl quite my lon∣de: I shall doo this that is of reason, and none otherwyse. Syr sayde the stuarde I shall gladly doo your com∣maundement, doubte not for it, than went the stuarde in his house, and made him readye on horsebacke, and rode out of Tholouse, and tooke the Heraude of the kinge Charlemaine with him. And whan they were com vnto Mountawban: they foūde the Emperoure Charlemaine in his pa∣uyllion, where the stuarde lyghted down, and went within and saluted the king Charlemayne fro the kynge yon of Gascoygn, and presented him the letters fro his behalfe, and sayde vnto hym. Right mighty Emperour the kinge yon sendeth you worde by me that yf ye wil ensure his lond: he shall fulfil the tenour of this lettre, and otherwise he wyl not.</P>
<P>WHan Charlemayne vnderstood these tydynges: he was ryghte gladde, he tooke the lettre of the messanger, and called Rowlande to him &amp; Olyuer, the byshop Tur∣pyn, the duke Naymes. Ogier the
<PB N="lx" REF="65"/> dane, and the .xii. peeres of Fraunce, and said to them. Fayre lordes be not displeased, goe out of this pauillyon, for I will talke with this messanger priuely. Syr said they al with a good will. And than they went all out of the pauillion, and whan they were al gone: Charlemayne opened the let∣tres and red theim all alonge. And he found therin that whiche he most desyred in this worlde, that was the treason as it was ordeyned, whan Charlemaine had red the lettre: he myghte be no gladder than he was. And of the great Ioye that he hadde of it he began to smyle. Syr sayd the stuarde yf ye see oughte in the lettre that pleaseth you not: blame not me for it. For I know not yet what it is. Than sayde Charlemaine to the stu∣arde. Your lorde the kinge yon spea∣keth ful curteously, and if he doo that he dooth me to wyt: he shall be well my good freend. And so shall I doo to hym great worship, and shal make hym a great man, and also I shal de∣fende him ayenst all men. Syr sayde the stuarde of this that ye say: ye shal giue me sureties yf it please you. Than said Charlemayne, I wyl doo so gladlye. This I swere vpon the sonne of the vyrgyn Mary and also vpon saint Denis of Fraunce whose man I am. Sir ye haue said all yno∣ugh answered the messanger of king yon, and none other surety I aske of you.</P>
<P>THan Charlemain called his chamberlayne &amp; said to hym make a lettre to king yon of gascoy∣ne in my behalfe, as I shall deuyse it vnto you. Wryt that I sende him salutacion and good loue, and that it he dooth for me as he sayth I shall encrease hys realme with fourtene good castelles and therof I giue him for suretie our lorde and saint denys of Fraunce, and that I send him four manteles of scarlette furred with er∣mines, for to clothe withall the tray∣toures, whan they shall goe to the playne of Valcoloures, and there they shal be hanged if god wil, and I wil not that any other haue harme, but only the foure sonnes of Aimon. Syr said the chambrelain, your com∣maundement shal be wel doone, and than he made the lettres, as thempe∣roure had deuised him. And whan he had made them: the emperour Char∣lemayn sealed them, and after he cal∣led the messager afore his presence, and saide to him. Holde these lettres and take them to king yon from me, and recommend me to him. And than he dyd gyue hym .x. marke of golde and a Kyng that he tooke of his fyn∣ger. Wherof the messanger thanked him much humbly, and incontinente lighted on horsebacke, and whan he was aryued: he salued the kyng yon of Gascoyn from king Charlemai∣nes behalfe and tooke him the letters and the mantelles as Charlemayne had commaunded him.</P>
<P>THan whan the messanger of the king yon was gone Char∣lemaine made come afore hym Foulques of Moryllon, and Ogier the dane, and sayd to them. Lordes I haue sente for you. For I wil that ye two knowe a litill of my secretes.
<PB REF="66"/> But I tell you vpon your faith that none other shall know the same but onely we vs three vnto the time that the deede be accomplyshed. Syr sayd Ogier yf ye thinke that we shoulde discouer youre secrete: tell it vs not And if ye truste vs: declare hardelye your pleasure. Certes said the empe∣roure to Ogier, ye be well worthy to knowe al, for I know you for a good and a trusty knight. Sir saide Ogier your good gcamercy. But I tell you that I wyll not know nothyng ther∣of, but that ye take fyrste mine othe therupon. Lordes said Charlemaine I take it. Nowe shall ye goe to the plaine of Valcolours with three hū∣dred knightes wel armed, and whan ye shall come there: ye shall finde the foure sonnes of Aimon. And thus I commaunde you that ye brynge them to me other dead or quicke, Syr saide Ogier I saw them neuer but armed, howe shall we know theym? Ogier saide Charlemaine ye shal well may knowe theym. For eche of theym shall be clothed wyth a mantell of scarlette furred wyth ermynes and shall beare roses in theyr handes.</P>
<P>Syr saide Ogier that is a good to∣ken, and we shal doo your commaū∣demente. They made none other ta∣ryinge but departed from the hoste of the kinge Charlemaine as pryuelye as they myght doo. And rode to the plaine of Valcolours, and put them selfe in a busshemente wythin a woode all of serpyn trees, vnto the tyme that the foure sonnes of Aimon came to the playne of Valcoloures. Ha god whye knewe not Reynawde and hys bretherne this mortall trea∣son? for they wolde not haue come there vpon mules: But they shoulde haue come there vpon good horses, and well armed, as prue and worthy knightes that they were. But &amp; god had not remedied it: thys Reynawde and his bretherne shoulde haue been so one taken in a litill space, for they were in daunger of death. Whan O∣gyer y<SUP>e</SUP> dane &amp; Foulques of Moryllō were in their bushement: Foulques called his folke and sayde to theym. Fayre lordes I oughte well to hate Reynawde, for he slewe myne vncle by great wronge. Nowe am I come to the poynt that I shall be auenged on hym, and I shall tell you howe. Nowe wyt it that the kynge you of Gascoyn hath betrayed thē and they shall come hyther anon all vnarmed sauf their swerdes. And therfore I praye you all that ye thynke to smite well vpon them, then shall I know who loueth me best. Doo so that none of theim scape, and ye shall be well my good freendes, and I shall loue you well.</P>
<P>NOw shal we telle you of the kynge yon that was at Tho∣louse. Whan he had receyued the let∣tres of the kinge Charlemayne: he called to hym his secretary Godras and said to him. Looke what this let¦tre sayeth. And the clerke brake in continent the seale, and beheld the te∣noure of the lettre, and founde howe Reynawde and hys brethern should be betrayed and liuered to the death, &amp;
<PB N="lxi" REF="66"/> whan the clerke had redde the lettre: he began to weep sore tenderlye, and if it had not be for doubt of the king: he wolde gladly haue vttered it, and whan kinge yon saw his secretarye weep: he saide thus to him, keep wel vpon your lyfe that ye hide nothinge fro me, but tell me all that the let∣tre conteineth and what the kynge Charlemayne wryteth to me. By my fayth said Godras. It is a sore thing for to reherce. Nowe lightely sayde the kyng yon, tell me what the kyng Charlemayne sendeth me, syr sayde Godras, I shall tell it you gladlye. And than he beganne to shewe to kyng yon howe Charlemayne sente him worde, that yf he wolde doo as he had wryten vnto him: he shoulde encreace his power of fourtene good castelles more than he had. For the suretie wherof: he swereth it vnto you vpon our lorde god, and saint denys of Fraunce his patrone. And he sen∣deth you foure mantelles of scarlete furred with ermines, that ye shall geue to the foure sonnes of Aymon, for to were theym, &amp; thus they shall be knowen. For Charlemaine will not that none take any harme, but on¦ly the foure sonnes of Aimon. And he dooth you wyt that his folke are with in a bushement within a woode by the plaine of Valcolours, that is to wyt Foulques of Moryllon and Ogier the dane, with three hundreth men wel horsed and well armed that abiden there foure sonnes of Aimon, the which ye should deliuer in to their handes. Whan the kinge yon vnder∣stoode the tenoure of the lettre: he made haste for to fulfil his promise. And incontinent he lyghted on horse∣backe, and tooke in his company a hundred men wel arraied, and tooke his waye towarde Mountawban. And as soone as he might: he came &amp; entred with in at the gate fletcher.</P>
<P>And whan he was within: he made his folke to lodge them in the borow And he went vp to the palays as he was wont to doo whā he cam there. Thē whan his sister the wife of Rei∣nawd wist of the coming of the king yon her brother: she came ayenst him and tooke him by the hand, &amp; wolde haue kissed him as she was accusto∣med to doo whan he came there, but the king full of euell treason turned hys face a syde, and sayde he had the tooth ache, and wolde not speake with her but litill. But he sayde that men should make him a bedde ready. For he wolde rest him selfe a lytell And whan he was layde: he began sore to thinke, and saide to him selfe. Ha good lord, what haue I wrought ayenst the best knyghtes of the world that I haue betrayed so falsly. Now shall they be hanged to morow with∣oute faute. I pray god to haue mercy and pitie vpon them? Now maye I well saye that I shall be lykened to Iudas from hence forthe, and I shal haue loste the loue of god and of hys mother, and also myne honour. But I must needes doo it sith I haue pro∣mysed it so, and the wyll of my ba∣rons is such, for thus they haue coū∣celled and haue made me do it. Wher∣of I am ful sore displeased.</P>
<PB REF="67"/>
<P>AL thus as the king yon thou∣ghte in the greate treason that was thus machyned vpon the foure sonnes of Aymon: there came in Reinawde from hunting, &amp; al his bretherne with him, and had taken four wild bores sore great, and whan Reinawde was within Mountaw∣ban: he hearde the noyse of the horses and wende that it had been straunge knightes that were come vnto him to take wagis. And than he asked of a yemā what folke were these straū∣geres that were come in withou leue? Syr said the yeman they ben the fol∣ke of king yon that is come within for to speake with you of some ma∣ters. But me semeth by his folke y<SUP>t</SUP> he is not well at ease of his persone.</P>
<P>THan said the good Reinawd. Ha God why hath my lorde traueylled himselfe so muche for to come hither? For I wold with a good will haue gone to him. And after whan he had that saide: he called to him a seruaunte of his and sayde to him, goe fet me my horne Boudiere. For I wyll make feast and Ioye for the coming of my souerain lorde, and incontinent it was brought to him, and Reynawde tooke it and sayde to his bretherne, Nowe take eche of you his owne and let vs make feast for the loue of king yon. Than they tooke eche of them his horne and be¦gan to sowne all foure at ones right high, and made so greate noyse that the castel sowned of it. For they ma∣de so great Ioye for the loue of kinge yon that it was merueyll. Whan the kynge yon heard the trumpettes that thus sowned so sore that the chā¦bre where as he laye shooke of it: he arose vp from the bed and cam to the wyndowe, and said to him selfe. Ha what euyll haue I wrought ayenst these knightes? Alas howe make ye Ioye ayenst so greate a combraunce the which I haue purchased to you? I haue betrayed you right falsely, as a wycked and vntrewe kynge that I am. For a man that betrayed hys freend: oughte neuer to haue honoure nother in this world nor in the other but oughte to be lost bothe body and soule. For he hath forsaken god: and hathe gyuen himselfe to the deuyll. And whan he had saied that: he retur∣ned agayne vpon his bed sore vexed at the hearte and euell at ease more than any man might be. Than Rey∣nawde and his bretherne came vp to the palace, where thei foūd the king yon, and whan he sawe theym come: he rose ayenst them, and tooke them by the hande and saide to Reinawd. Be not merueylled that I haue not enbraced nor kyssed you: for I am sore laden with great euyll. And it is wel fourtene daies gone that I could nother eate nor drinke anye thyng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that dyd me good. Than saide Rey∣nawd sir ye be in a good place where ye shall be tended vpon ryghte well with goddes grace. And I and my bretherne shall serue you to oure po∣were, gramercy saide the kinge yon. Than called he his stuarde and sayd to him. Go and bring me the mantel¦les of scarlet furred wyth ermynes that I haue doone make for my dere freendes. Incontinente the stuarde
<PB N="lxii" REF="67"/> dyd the commaundemente of kynge yon. And as sone that he was come agayne: the king made the foure bre∣thern to put the foure mantelles vp∣on them, and praied theim to were them for his loue. Sir saide Alarde this is a gladde presente and we shal were theim for the loue of you with very good will. Alas if they hadde knowen how the thing was brought aboute, they shoulde not haue borne them, but they should haue doone al otherwise. Alas and what sorowful harme they hadde of this, that they were thus clothed. For that were the tokens and recognyssaunce wherof they were in daūger of death, if god had not holpen them of his pitie and mercy. And whan the foure sonnes of Aimō had their mautelles on: the kyng yon behelde them, and had of them great pitie, and began to weep There was his stewarde that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rayson well wist, that saide not one word for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere of king yon. And whā the mete was redy: Reynawde pra∣yed muche the king that he woulde eate. For he made him to be serued ryght wel. Whan they had eaten: the kyng yon rose vpon his feet, and to∣ke Reynawde by the hande, and said to him. My faire brother &amp; my frend. I wil tell a counseyll that ye know not. Nowe wyt that I haue bee at Mountbenden, and I haue spoken with king Charlemayne the which charged me of treason, by cause that I keep you in my realme, wherof I haue presented my gage afore all hys company, and no mā was there so hardy that durste speake ayenste that, that I sayd. After this we had many wordes togither, among whi∣che we spake of good accorde and of peace, whereof at the laste the kyng Charlemayne was contente for my loue for to make peace with you, in the maner that foloweth. That is to were that to morow erly ye shal goe to the playne of Valcoloures ye and your brethrē al vnarmed but of your swerdes mounted vpon youre mu∣les, and clothed with the mantelles that I haue geuen to you, and that ye shall beare in your handes Roses and floures, and I shall sende with you eyght of myne earles for to goe more honourably, the which ben al of my lygnage. And there ye shal finde the king Charlemaine, and the duke Naymes of hauyere, and Ogyer the Dane, and all the twelue Peres of Fraunce, and there Charlemayne shall gyue you suertie. And ye shall doo to him reuerence in such maner that ye shal cast your selfe to his feet and there he shall pardone, you, and he shall gyue you agayne all youre londes entierly.</P>
<P>THan sayde Reinawde, syr for gods mercy. For I haue greate doubt of the king Charlemaine by cause he hateth vs to death as ye know. And I promyse you it he hol∣dethe vs he shall make vs to die a shamefull death. Good freend saide the traytoure kynge yon, haue ye no doubte at al. For he hath sworne vn∣to me vpon his faith afore al his ba∣ronye. Sir answered Reynawde we shall doo your commaundements. Ha God sayde Alarde. What saye you my brother? ye knowe well that
<PB REF="68"/> kynge Charlemayne hath made his oth many times that if he may take vs ones by ony maner of meane: he shall bringe vs to a shameful dethe. Now I meruayle me greatly of you faire brother, how ye wil accorde for to goe put your selfe and vs in to his handes, al vnarmed as a poore mis∣chaunte. Neuer haue god mercy v∣pō my soule, yf I goe there without mine armes, nor without to be as it apperteyneth, brother said Reinawd ye saye not well. God forbed that I should mistrust my lorde the kyng yon of any thing that he telleth me. And than he turned hym towarde the kyng yon and sayde to hym. Sir without any faute we shall be there to morowe earlye in the mornyng, whatsoeuer happeth of it. Fayre lordes said Reynawde god hath hol∣pen vs wel that we haue peace with the kynge Charlemayne to whome we haue made so longe time so mor∣tall a warre, but sith that my Lorde the king you hath made thys peace: I am content to doo to him as much reuerence as to me is possyble. For I am delybered to goe naked in my small lynen clothes to the Mounte∣saynt Michael. And whā Reinawd had sayd this word: he toke leaue of kyng yon and went in to the cham∣bre of the faire lady his wife, &amp; foūd there his other two brethren that were with her, &amp; whā the lady saw her husbonde come: she came ayenst hym and tooke him betwen both her armes by great loue and kissed hym Lady sayd Reynawde I ought wel to loue you by great reason. For your brother the king you hath trauailed hm selfe right sore for me, and hathe be sore blamed at the courte of Char∣lemaine for me, but he hath doone so muche blessed be god that he hathe made my peace with the king Char∣lemaine. And that Rowland and O∣liuer. Nor all the twelue Peeres of fraūce might neuer make: he hathe graunted vs againe all our landes. And all thus we shall be riche, and shal liue al our life in reste &amp; peace, &amp; so shall we mow helpe, and gyue the hauoyre that we haue vnto the poore knightes that haue serued all theyr lyfe truely and wel.</P>
<P>THan sayd the lady. I thanke god greatly therof with al my hert. But tell me where the concor∣daunce shall be made, and hyde it not from me yf it please you. Lady sayde Reynawde I shal tell it you without any faute. Wit that to morowe we muste ryde to the playne of Valco∣lours, &amp; there the peace shal be made but I and my brethren must goe thi∣ther without armes but onely oure swerdes, and vpon mules, berynge roses in oure handes. And there we shal fynde the duke Naymes of ba∣uyere &amp; Ogyer the Dane &amp; al the .xii Peeres of Fraunce, that shal receiue othes, whā the lady vnderstod these wordes: she was so sore an angred thereof that almost she had lost her witte, and saide to Reynawde. Syr yf ye wyl beleue me. ye shall not goe one fote there. For the plaine of Val¦colours are so daungerous, for there is a roch ryght hyghe, and there ben foure grete woodes rounde aboute, yf ye will beleue me ye shall take a

For I dyd dreame to nyghte a dreame that was fereful &amp; merueilous, for me se∣med that I was at the windowes of the great palace, and sawe come out of the greate wood of Ardeyn well a thousande wilde bores, that hadde greate and hortyble reeth, the which flewe you and rented your body al in peeces, and also I saw that the great towre of Mountawban fel downe to y<SUP>e</SUP> grounde, &amp; moreouer I saw a shot of aduenture, that smot your brother Alarde so harde that it perced his body through and through, and that the chapel of Saint Nycolas which is within this castel fell downe to the earthe, and all the ymages that been in it wepte for greate pitte. And the two aūgelles came downe from heauen that hāged your brother Ri∣charde at an apple tree, and then the saide Richarde cried with an hyghe voice. Fayre brother Reynawd come and helpe me, and Incontinente ye went there vpon youre horse bay∣arde, but he fell downe by the waye vnder you, wherfore ye mightht not come time ynough, wherof ye were ful sory. &amp; therfore good syr I coun∣seyle you that ye go not there.</P>
<P>LAdye sayde Reynawde holde your peace, for who that beleueth ouer muche in dreames: he dooth a∣yenst the commaundemente of God. Than said Alarde by the faythe that I owe to god. I shal neuer sette foote there, nor I nother saide Rycharde, Alas saide than Guycharde, yf we must goe there: lette vs not departe thitherwarde as men of counceylle: but let vs go there lyke as prue and worthy knightes, hauing eche of vs his armes vpon him &amp; wel &amp; horse∣backe &amp; not vpon mules: on that our brother Reinawde he well mounted vpon baiarde, which shal may beare vs al foure at a need, by god sayde Reynawd ye shal say what ye wil, but I shal go there as I haue saide what so euer happeth, and than he went out of his chambre &amp; came to king yon, and said to him. By god I merueill me muche of my brethren, that wil not go with me, because they haue no horses with them, and yf it please you ye shall giue vs leaue to take eche of vs a horse &amp; ye shal keep stil your eyght earles with you, and we shal go there as ye haue commaū¦ded vs, I wil not doo it said the kyng you, for the kyng Charlemaine dou∣teth you to sore and youre bretherne and your horses, &amp; also I haue giuen hostages &amp; suretes that ye shal beare no maner of harneys with you, but onely your swerdes as I haue tolde you afore, and that ye shal ride vpon mules, &amp; not vpon horses.

<P>Than said Reinawd, sir syth that it is so: we shal go there. And than he wente from kyng yon in to his chambre again, and founde his wife that noble lady, Alard and Richarde that asked him how he had doone, &amp; if they should haue his good horse bayarde with theym? By God said Reinawde I can not haue leaue to doo so, but my bretherne doubte you not, for the kynge yon is a true prince, and if he shoulde betray vs: he should be sore blamed for it, for he shal make vs to be conduyted by ey∣ght of the moste great erles of his re∣alme, &amp; god confounde me yf I sawe euer ony euil doone by him. Sir said hys bretherne we shal goe gladly w<SUP>t</SUP> you, sith that ye wyl haue vs needes to doo so. Whan they were thus ac∣corded herto: thei wente to bed &amp; slept vnto the daye appeared, and whan Reynawde sawe the daye: he rose vp and saide to his bretherne. Arise sits and make vs redy for to goe there as we should goe, For yf Charlemayne be sooner to y<SUP>e</SUP> plaines of valcolours than we: he shal hapely be angry for it. Syr sayde hys bretherne, we shall soone be redy, &amp; whan they were all redy, they wēt to the churche of saint Nycolas for to heare masse, &amp; whan it came to the offryng: Reynawde &amp; his bretherne offred many ryche gyf∣tes. And after the masse was done: they asked after theyr mules &amp; incō∣tinent they mounted vpon, &amp; in their felowship were eyght earles, y<SUP>e</SUP> whi∣che knewe all the maner of treason. &amp; whan they were all mounted they tooke on theyr way but the foure sō∣nes of Aymon were good to knowe by the other, for they had on greate mantelles of scarlet turred with er∣mynes, &amp; bare in their handes roses in tokē of peace &amp; also their swerdes for they wold not gyrde theim. Now god be with them, for if he keep them not: they bene in waye of perdycyon &amp; neuer to come againe to Moūtaw∣ban. whan the king yon sawe them thus go: he fell downe in a swount more then foure times, for the great sorowe that he had at his hearte, for how be it that he had betrayed them so: yet had he great pitie of them, but this that he had doone. euyl counseyl had made him doo it. And than he be: gan to make the greatest sorow in the worlde, &amp; said, ha good lorde what haue I doone? dyd euer man so great treason as I haue doone? nay verely for I haue betrayed the best knyghts of the world, and the moste worthye and true.</P>
<P>THan sayde his folke. Syr ye doo not wel to make suche a sorowe, for Reynawde is very wise &amp; he shal it perceiue ryght soone. Ha god sayd the king yon, were it as ye saye, for I shoulde be more gladde than yf I had wonne tenne of the best cyties of Fraunce, for Reynaw∣de is my freend and my brother. Ha Mawgys how shal ye be sory whā
<PB N="lxiiii" REF="69"/> ye shal know this matter. Reynaw∣de did great foly, whan he tooke not your aduyse in this thynge, for yf he had knowen of it: ye should not haue suffred him to go there.

<P>NOw begynneth the piteous hystory of the foure sonnes of Aimon that wente to theyr deathe by the meanes of the traytour kyng yon. And bycause of the treason that he cōmited ayenst the foure sonnes of Aymon: he loste the realme of gas∣coygne the name &amp; the dygnyte ther∣of, for neuer sith that tyme was no kyng crowned in Gascoygne. Now shall I tell you of Reynawde and of his brethren, than tode Reynawde and his brethren towarde the plaine of Valcolours, and as they toode thitherwardi Alarde began to syng ryghte sweetly and Ioyfull a newe songe, and Guycharde and Rychard dyd in lykewise, but I tell you that no instrument of musike sowned ne∣uer so melodyouslye as the three bre∣thren dyd syngyng to gither, alas what pyty was it of so noble and so worthy knightes that went singing and makyng Ioy to their death, they were as the swanne that syngeth that yere that she shall die, Reynawd went behynde them sore thynkyng, hys head bowed down towarde the earth, and beheide hys brethern that rode forth makyng great Ioye, and he sayd, o god what knyghtes be my brethrene that there been none suche in all the world, nother so gracyous? And whan he had saide this: he sette his hands together and heued them vp towarde heauen all weping, and saide in this maner, good lord by thy gloryous and blessed name that did∣dest cast daniell out fro the lyons, &amp; delyuered Ionas fro the fyshes bely and saued saynt Peter whan he cast himselfe from the sea for to come to the &amp; pardoned Mary magdalene, &amp; and made the blinde to see, &amp; suffred passion &amp; deathe vpon the crosse for our sinnes, &amp; pardoned Longyus y<SUP>t</SUP> smot thee with a spere in to thy bles∣sed side, wherfro thy blessed bloud fel in to his eyen, and incontinent he re∣couered his syght therby, and by thy resurreccion, keep this day my body if it please the fro deth and from pri∣son, and also my brethren for I wote not where that we goe, but me se∣meth that we go in great peryl. And whan he had fynyshed his oryson: his eyne wexed were againe for pitie that he had, least his brethren should haue any harme for loue of him. For it plesed him not wel, that thei were so bare of their armes.</P>
<P>THan whan Alarde saw his brother Reynawde that had his eyne ful of teres, he sayed to him Ha brother what ayleth you I haue sen you in right great peril &amp; aboute
<PB REF="70"/> a harde werke, but I sawe you neuer make so yl cheere as ye doo now, for I haue seen you weep at this houre. wher of I meruail me greatly, for I wot wel for certayne y<SUP>t</SUP> ye weep not without some great occasion. Than sayd Reynawde. Fayre brother me ayleth nothinge. By y<SUP>e</SUP> faithe that I owe to you sayd Alarde ye weep not for nothynge. This is the daie y<SUP>t</SUP> we sholde be at one with kynge Charle∣mayne, so pray I you for god my de∣re brother that ye leue this sorowe, &amp; let vs go forth mereli and bere out a good face as longe as we ben alyue, for after that a mā is ones deceassed it is no more spokē of him. And this I praye you bretherne that ye synge with vs. For ye haue so fayre a voice that it is a great pleasure for to heare you syng, whan ye be wyllinge to it. Brother said Reinawde with a good wyll, syth that it pleaseth you. And than began Reynawde for to synge so melodiousli: y<SUP>t</SUP> it was a great plea∣sure for to here hym. So longe rode the foure sonnes of Aymon the lytell pace of their mules, syngyng and deuisnge amonge theymselfe: that they came to the playne of Valco∣lours. ❧ Now wyl I tel you of the facion of the valey, for wyt that if I telled you not: ye shoulde not maye know it. There is a roch right hie &amp; noyous to goe vp, &amp; it is enuironned rounde aboute with foure great fore∣stes ryght great &amp; thycke, for the least is there a dayes Iourney to ryde thrugh it, &amp; ther bē foure great riuers all aboute it sore deep, wereof y<SUP>e</SUP> gre∣test is named Gyronde, the other is called Dordon, the thyrde is named Nore, &amp; the other Balancon, &amp; there is nothet castell nor towne by .xx. mile nighe about it. And therfore the treason was there deuysed, for thys playne of Valcolours was ferre fro all folke, &amp; there was a way crossed in foure, the one waye was towarde Fraunce, the other in to Spaine, the other in to Galyce, and the fourth in to Gascoygne. And at euery one of these foure wayes: was layde a bus∣shement os .v. hundred men wel hor∣sed and armed for to take Reinawde and his brethren quicke or deade, for thus had they sworne it, &amp; promised to kyng Charlemayne. Than come there Reinawd &amp; his bretheren with theyr felawshyp of eyght erles, that the kynge yon of Gascoyne had take to them, the whiche wist well al the mistery of this treason. And incon∣tinent Ogier the dane sawe theym fyrste of all, the which was all aba∣shed, and sayd to his folke, fayre lor∣des ye ben my men my subiectts and my freends, ye know that Reynawd is my cosyn, &amp; I ought not to see his death nor his domage. Wherfore I pray you all that ye will doo him no harme at all, nor to none of his bre∣therne my cosyns. They answered al, that they should doo his commaū∣dement with a good will. This hā∣gyng: Reynawde and his brethrene passed by &amp; wente in to the myddes of the playne.</P>
<P>THan whā Reinawd and his brethrē were come there, and found no body: they were of it sore a bashed. And after whan Alarde saw this: he called his brother Rychard
<PB N="lxv" REF="70"/> and sayd to him. what is this fayre brother I se well that we ben berrai∣ed, for I se you chaunge your colour, how think ye? Brother said Richard I doubt me sore for Reynawd, haue no doubt said Alarde. For we shall haue nothyng but good. My brother sayd Rychard I promyse you all my heart shaketh, nor neuer in my daies I had not so great feare, for al my he∣res ryse vp, wherof I doubte me sore that we ben betrayed, &amp; that more is: I should not be aferde yf Reynawde were armed &amp; set vpon bayarde, and we also, for thus as ben now we bē halfe discomfired. And whan he had saied thus: he spake to Reynawde &amp; said, Brother why doo we tary heere sith that we haue foūd no body with whome we shoulde speake? for if .xx. knights wer here armed: thei should haue vs where they wolde maugre our teeth as bestes, seing y<SUP>t</SUP> we haue so many enemies in Fraūce, ye wold not beleue this that we told you, and also youre wife at Mountawban, wherof I feare me sore that ye shall haue no leiser for to repent you of it. For if our cosin Mawgis had be heer with vs &amp; that ye had your good hors baiard: we should not doubt Charle∣maine with al his puissaunce of a straw. I pray you let vs go hence, for I promise you it is foly for to abide heere long, for I know wel y<SUP>t</SUP> Char∣lemaine hath made vs to come here as bestes clothed with scarlet, nor I can not beleue none other, but that y<SUP>e</SUP> kinge you hath falsly betrayed vs.</P>
<P>CErtes fayre brother ye saye trouth sayde Reynawde, and I perceyue me well of it now let vs goe backe againe all fayre &amp; softe, &amp; as they wolde haue returned: Rey∣nawde behelde a side &amp; sawe well a thousande knightes armed com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng a greate pace ayenst them, &amp; Foul∣ques of Morylion came afore at the other, wel horsed his shelde afore his brest &amp; his spere alowe in the rest the great wallop ayenst Reynawd for he was the man in the worlde that he most hated. whan Reynawde sawe com Foulques of Morillon: he knew him wel at his shelde, &amp; was so an∣gred for it y<SUP>t</SUP> he wist not what to doo. A god what shal we poore siners doo I se wel y<SUP>t</SUP> we must die this day with out doubte. Brother said Alard what saie ye? by my faithe said Reinawde I se heere great sorow.

For they scratched their visages and pulled their heares. And whan Alarde was a litell assured: he sayd. Ha fayre bre∣therne Guycharde &amp; Richarde, now is the day come that we shall die al throughe mortal treason, for I know wel tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Reynawde hath betrayed vs: and certes I wolde neuer haue thought that any treasō should haue entred within so noble a man as he is, he made vs come here a yenst our willes and maugre vs, bycause he knoweth well the treason. Ha Rey∣nawde the Sonne of Aimon of Ar∣deine, and who shal euer truste anye
<PB REF="71"/> man, whan ye that are our brother, and that we take for our lorde, haue brought vs hither maugre vs to our death, and haue betraied vs so falsly O Rychard said Alarde drawe oute youre swerde, by god the traytoure shall die with vs. For wel ought the traytoure to die that hathe procured so mortall a treason, whan Alarde had sayde this: they all three dyd set hande to their swerdes and came to Reinawde, for to slea him yrefullye &amp; sore an angred as lyons, for they trowed for verye certaine that Rey∣nawde had betrayed theim, whan Reynawde sawe them come thus: he made semblaunte to defend him self, but lough at them by greate loue, a∣las said richard what had I thought. I woulde not slea my brother for all the good in the worlde, and so sayde Alarde and Guychard, for they were sore repented of this that they had en¦terprysed for to doo, and they began all for to weep for pitie and cast their swerdes downe to the earthe and kissed Reynawd sore weeping. And Alard sayd. Ha good Reynawd why haue you betrayed vs so? we be no∣ther normanes nor Englishe nor al∣maines, but we be brethren of one rather and of one mother, &amp; we holde you for our lorde. For god brother Reynawde tel vs of whence cometh this treason, we ben com of so noble kinne of Gerarde of Roussyllon and of Dron of Nantuell and of the duke Benes of Aygremoūt, &amp; neuer none of our lignage thought no treason, &amp; how haue ye doon so that haue procu¦red i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> now ayenst your naturall bre∣thern, certes it is a great fault to you</P>
<P>BRother sayd Reinawd I haue more greate pitie of you than I haue of mine own selfe, for I haue brought you heere ayenst your wyll and if I had beleued you this mise∣happe had not come to vs. I haue brought you heere, &amp; I promise you I shal bringe you againe from hens with gods grace. Recommende oure selfe to our lorde, and thinke for to defende vs wel, &amp; feare not the death for our worship. For ones we muste die withoute fayle. But it is good to get worship. Brother said richard, shall ye helpe vs? yea said Reinawd doubt not therof. And whan he had that sayd, he turned toward the ear∣les and sayde to them, fayre lordes the kynge you hathe sente you with vs: for to conduyte vs, &amp; vnder the suertie of you we be com heere to lese our liues. And therfore I pray you y<SUP>t</SUP> ye will helpe vs. Reinawde (sayde the earle of Ansom) It is not for vs to bargaine heere long, but let vs all flee for to saue ourselfe and we may, than saide Reinawde by my head ye be all traytours, and I shall smite of all your heades. Brother said Alard what tary ye so longe, for they bene well worthy for to die, sith that they ben traitours. And whā Rainawde vnderstood that word of his brother: he sette hande to his swerde &amp; smote the earle of Ansom so great a stroke vpon the head that he cloued hym to the harde teeth, and it was well rea∣son, for it was he that coūseyled this treason to the kinge you, that was the rewarde that he had for the first, whan the earle of Ansom was thus slaine: the other seuen began to flee,
<PB N="lxvi" REF="71"/> and Reinawd tan after, but he could not renne fast: for his mule was to sore lade of the weyghte of his body, so that the beast fel doown vnder him For Reinawd to say the trouth was so bygge made and so greate that no horse might beare him but onely bai∣arde. For as it is said Reinawd had xvi. feete of length &amp; was wel shape of body after the greatnes.</P>
<P>THan whan Reynawde saw him self a grounde: he stood vp light∣lye with his mule and sayd, ha Baiard my good horse that I am not on your backe armed of al peces, for or euer that I shoulde be ouercome: I should sell my death ful dere. Alas none ought not to cōplaine my deth sith that I haue purchased it myself. Brother said Guychard what shall we doo? heere be our enemies euen by vs, if ye thinke it good: let vs aduen∣ture to passe ouer this ryuer and goe vpon that highe roch, and so we shal may saue our self. Goe foole goe said Reinawde what saye ye? ye wot wel that our mules myght not renne be∣fore the horses, what shoulde auayle vs for to flee sith that we might not saue our selfe? Certes I should not flee for all the worlde. I haue leuer die with my worship: than I should liue with great shame, for he that di∣eth in fleeing: hys soule shal neuer be saued. Thus as Reynawde spake to his brother Richarde: Alard saide to hym brother Reynawde lette vs lyghte from oure mules a foote and shryue our selfe the one to thother to thende that we be not ouercome by the deuill. Freend said Reynawd ye say well and wisely, and they dyd as Alarde had deuised. And whan they wer confessed thone to thother: Rei∣nawde said to his brethern. Lordes let vs doo suche a thing, wherof we shall get worshippe, sith it is so that we may not scape: lette vs kylle thē that come first vpon vs, and we shal haue auauntage vpon thother, &amp; god¦des curse haue him that shall feyne himselfe.</P>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Han whan Alard hearde Rei∣nawde speake thus: he colled him with his armes and kissed him al wepīg &amp; said to him.

Than he began to cry &amp; sayd Reynawde Rey∣nawd ye are come to your death, and I promise you he y<SUP>t</SUP> moste loueth you hath betrayed you, that is the kynge you, but haue pacyēce, for I shall set

Reinawd what shal ye doo? wil ye defende or yelde you? but youre defence shall be not worth to you. And yf ye make a∣ny semblaunt to defende youre selfe: I shall slea you incontinent.</P>
<P>FOulques sayde Reinawd ye speke well lyke a beast, and trow you that I shal yelde me quicke to Charlemayne or to you? I shall fyrst smite of your heade &amp; the helme withal if I can rech to you, ye know well howe my swerde cutteth. By god Foulques sayd Reynawd ye are greatly to be blamed for to haue gy∣uen the counseyll for to make vs to be betrayed by the kynge you, for it is the foulest crafte that a knyghte may for to doo treasō. But doo as a gentilman ought to doo, to the ende that men say not that it is treason, yf ye will lette vs goe: we shall be all foure ready to become liegemen of y<SUP>e</SUP> king Charlemayne, and I shal gyue you my horse Bayarde, the whiche I gaue not for all the golde in the world, and also I shal gyue you the strong castel Moūtawban, and if the kyng Charlemayne maketh warre ayenst you for loue of vs: we shall serue you with fyue hundred knigh∣tes well armed and well horsed euer more, and if it please you ye shal saue vs our liues. And yf ye will not doo this: doo another thyng that I shall tell you for to keep you to bee not called a traytoure.

By god Reynawd. saide Foulques your preaching shall not auayle you no∣thynge, for I haue leuer to haue foūd you now in this araye, than that I had wonne an hundred thousande marke of fyne golde. Nowe is youre cosyn the wyse Mawgis ferre from you, he can not giue you no couseyle at this houre, and also all your folke be well ferre fro you, they shall not giue you socoures, and also I know the goodnes of my mē and that they haue promised the king Charlemain that they shall not fayle to assayle you worthely, by my fayth sayd Rei∣nawde and we shal defende our selfe also to oure power. Than saide A∣larde to Reynawde, brother what or∣denaunce shal we keep? brother (said Rainawd) we shal kep foote troo and two: ye and Guycharde shall be be∣hynde, and I and Rycharde shall make the forewarde, and lette vs smite well harde I pray you, for the time is now com that we must needs doo so, and make we that thyng that
<PB N="lxvii" REF="72"/> shalbe lefte in perpetuall memory to them that shalbe after vs, sith that by no wyse we may not scape. Faire brother saide Alarde to Guycharde, ye were wel deceiued for that ye tro∣wed that Reinawd had betraied vs. I promise you he wold not doo it for all the golde of the worlde. By my fayth said than Guycharde to Alard I am now well whole, sith that our deare brother Reynawde shall be to our helpe, for as longe as he shall be a liue: we shall defende our selfe, but not after, for thoughe I might chose I wolde not liue after he were dead. And whan he had sayed thys: they medled themselfe amonge theyr ene∣mies. Shortly to speake of the foure sonnes of Aimon assembled wel a∣yenst three hundred good knightes, but their courage were neuerthelesse therfore as longe as they had lyfe in the body: but that they shewed vnto their enemies a knightes face, whan Foulques of Morylion sawe Rey∣nawde come: he spurred his horse with the spurres &amp; bare his speare a low, &amp; went &amp; smot Reynawd by the mantell of scarlet that was aboute his arme so great a stroke that hys spere entred through his thygh and ouerthrewe bothe hym and his mule to the earthe. Whan Alarde saw the stroke: he cried sore and sayde. Alas we haue lost Reynawde our brother that was al our hope and our secour now may we not escape, but that we shall be dead or taken, and it is better that we yelde vs prysoners at this time: than to defende vs anye more. For sith it is so: oure defence shall helpe vs nothynge ayenst so many folke. And whan Reynawde vnderstod the wordes of his brother, he cryed to him with a loude voyce and sayd. Fie vpon you gluttō what is that ye say? I haue no harme yet, but I am al whole as ye be, thāked be god, and yet shall I telle me full dere or I die. And whan Reynawde had saied this: he rose vp quickelye and tooke the spere with both his hā∣des, and pulled it oute of his thyghe with great greef, and after set hande to his swerde. And sayde to Foul∣ques of Moryllon, knyght if ye will doo like a good man: light a foote as I am. And ye shall knowe what I can doo. Whan Foulques of Moril∣lon vnderstode him: he turned vpon him sore an angred, and thought for to haue smitten him on hys heade, but Reynawde drewe a litell asyde, and wente and gaue vnto Foulques suche a stroke vpon hys helme: that nother yron nor stele myght not saue hym, but that Renawde cloue hym in to the harde teeth and felled him deade to the catthe. And whan he sawe him falle: he sayde vnto hym. Nowe vnhappy Traytoure that thy soule may haue no pardone, but goe to the pyt of helle. And whan he had saied that: he tooke the horse of Foul¦ques of Moryllon the whiche was right good, &amp; lighte vpon it inconti∣nent and tooke his sheeld &amp; his spere that Foulques of Moryllon had sho¦ued through and through his thyghe &amp; than he sayd to his brethren. Be ye al sure that as longe as I am a lyue: ye shal haue no harme, but the fren∣shemen shal saye that they haue an ylle neyghboure of me. And wyt it
<PB REF="73"/> whan he was an horsbacke: he was not well at ease, because that the sty∣roppes were to shorte for him. But he had other thinges to doo, than for to make them lenger. And whan he was thus set on horsbacke: he made his horse to renne and held his spere alowe, and went and mette with the earle Angenon by suche maner that he put both yron and wood throughe the brest of him so that he must fall down dead fro the horse to the groūd afore his foote. And after Reinawd set hande to his swerde, and smote a knighte suche a stroke that his hel∣me might not saue him, but cleued hym to the teeth. What shall I tell you more? Nowe wit it that at that time Renawde slewe wyth his owne hādes foure earles, thre dukes and sixe knightes, and after he begā to crye Mountawban with a hye voice. And after his crye: he went &amp; smote Roberte the lorde of Dygeon that was sonne to the duke of Bur∣goine so that the head with the helme he made it lepe to the grounde, &amp; af∣ter he slewe a nother sterke dead, that came to rescue the said lorde.</P>
<P>ANd whan Rainawde hadde doone this noble prowesse: he behelde about him, and trowed to haue seen his brethren than, but he saw none of them, wherof he was sore abasshed. O god sayd he where are my brethren gone? nowe be they well ferre from me, we shall neuer come togither again. And than came there Alarde that in likewyse had wonne a horse, the sheeld and the spere, for he had slaine a knight, and had taken his hors, but he was sore hurte. Neuerthelesse he came &amp; held side with his brother, and Rycharde and Guycharde came soone at the o∣ther side. Than Alarde saide to Rei∣nawde. Brother be al sure that we shall neuer faile you to the deth. And whan the foure brethrē were assem∣bled togither againe: they began to make so great distruccion of frenshe∣men, that none durste abyde theym. For all they that they hytte: scaped not the death. whan the frenshemen sawe this: they were meruailled, and said the one to the other. By my sou∣le this passeth all other wunder. I trow that they ben no knightes: but that they bē deuils, now let vs make to thēa sawte both behinde and be∣fore, for if they liue long: they shall do vs greate hurte. And whan they were hereto, accorded: they ranne all vpon the foure sonnes of Aymon so harde that they parted them woulde they or not. But Reynawde passed throughe them al and broughte him∣selfe out of the prese, and Alarde af∣ter hym. And Rycharde retourned fleeing toward the roche Mountbrō, and Guychard abode there on foo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, for the frenshemen had slayne hys mule vnder him, and had wounded him with two speres well deep into the flesh and was taken for prysoner and they bounde him bothe hande and foote, and layed him vpon a litel hors ouerthwarte, like as a sacke of corne so wounded as he was, and I promyse you men might wel folowe him by the trase, bicause of the bloud that came oute of his bodye, and so leed him so shamefullye as that it may
<PB N="lxviii" REF="73"/> had be a theef and went all betynge vpon hym, saying to hym that they led hym to Charlemayne, the which should make him to be hāged for to auenge the death of his deere neuew Berthelot that he loued so muche, y<SUP>e</SUP> whyche Reynawde slewe so shame∣fully playinge at the Chesse.</P>
<P>ANd whan Reynawde saw y<SUP>t</SUP> hys enemyes led his brother Guycharde so shamefully: he wexed almoste madde for angre, and called his brother Alarde to him and said, Fayre brother what shal we doo? see how shamefully they fare with our brother Guycharde, yf we suffre thē to brynge hym forth of this facyon: we shall neuer haue worshyp in our dayes. Brother sayd Alarde I wote not what we maye best doo for to a∣byde or for to goe to them. For I tel you that we be no mo but two, and they be so great nombre of folke that wee can doo nothing agaynst them. O god (sayd Reynawde) what shall I doo if the king Charlemaine make my brother to be hanged? I shall ne∣uer be at my hertes case, nor I shall neuer come to no courte, but men shal poynte me with the fynger, and shall saye see yonder is the sonne of Aymon that let his brother to be hā∣ged to the pyn tree of Moūtfaucon, &amp; he durst not succour hym. Certes sayd Reynawde to Alarde, brother I had leuer dy fyrst, but if I should res∣cue our brother fro death. Brother sayd Alarde now set your selfe afore &amp; I shal folow you &amp; after my power I wyl helpe you to rescue hym. And whan Reynawde heard y<SUP>t</SUP>: he cast his sheeld behinde him, and habandon∣ned his body all boldely as a Lyon, and cared not how the game should go, for ye saw neuer wood men hew in a forest, nor make so great noyse as Reynawde made with his swerde amonge his enemyes for he cutted &amp; hewed legges and armes by suche wyse that no man should beleue it, but they that see it. Thus made Rey¦nawde at that time y<SUP>t</SUP> the Frenchemē must needes make him way to passe whether thei wolde or no. And mani made hym way for the loue of O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ier for they knewe well that the foure sonnes of Aymon were his cosyns. And whan Reynawde was passed: he sayd to them that led his brother Guycharde. Let goe the knyghte ye yll folkes, for ye be not worthye to touche hym, and whan they that led Guycharde sawe come Reynawde: they were sore afrayed that they put them selfe to flight &amp; left Guycharde free and sayde the one to the other. here cometh the ende of the worlde. And whā Reynawde saw that they fled: the sayd to Alarde. Goe ye fayre brother and vnbinde Guicharde our brother and set him vpon this horse and gyue him a spere in his hande, &amp; come after me, for the traytours ben dyscomfyted. Brother sayd Alarde. I shall goe where it please you, but I tell you yf we parte one from the other: we shall neuer come together agayne seyng that we be so few &amp; so yll armed, but let vs keep together, &amp; helpe thone thother. Brother sayde Reynawde ye say well &amp; wisely, and we shal doo it. And than they wente bothe together to Guycharde, &amp; vn∣bounde
<PB REF="74"/> hym, and made him mounte on horsebacke y<SUP>e</SUP> sheelde at the necke, and the spere in the hande. Now goe there the three brethern together, and the fourth fighteth agaynst a greate nombre of folke, that was the valy∣aunt Richarde, that was the moste worthy of all after hys brother Rei∣nawde. But men had slaine his mu∣le vnder hym, and was wounded ryght sore. But he had slayne fiue er∣les, and well .xiiii. knyghtes, wherof he was so sore trauayled and so we∣ry, that he might not all moste defēde himselfe no more, but went rounde aboute the roche. And than came ge∣rarde of valcome that was cosyn to Foulques of Moryllon the whyche he had founde dead, wherof he made great sorowe, &amp; sayd. Ha gentyl kni∣ght it is great domage of your deth. Certes he that hath brought you to this death he is not my freend. Now shal I auenge me if I maye, &amp; than he came to the roche. And whan he saw Reynawde in so great greefe: he spurred his horse with his spurres &amp; bare his spere alowe &amp; smote Ry∣charde through the mantell of scar∣let, that he wrapped aboute his lifte arme so harde that the spere entred ferre in his bodye so muche that he brought hym to the erth, and as he drewe hys spere agayne: the guttes of Richarde came out of y<SUP>e</SUP> body into his lappe, &amp; the woūde was so great that the lyuer and the lounges appe¦red. Than began Gerarde to crye. No ware dyscoupled y<SUP>e</SUP> foure sonnes of Aymō, for I haue slayne Richard the hardy fighter, all the other shall soone be slayne or taken, yf god giue me helth. And I shall brynge them vnto the kynge Charlemayne, that shal make thē to be hanged at Moūt¦fawcon as soone as he hath them.</P>
<P>THan whan Richarde was come a lytle to his ese: he rose vp quyckely vpon hys feete, &amp; tooke hys bowelles with bothe his hādes and put them agayne into his belye and after set hande to hys swerde, &amp; came to Gerarde and sayd to hym in great angre. Thou cursed man thou shalt haue thy rewarde anon for that ye haue doon to me, for certes it shal not be vmbrayed to Reynawde that ye haue slayne his brother, and whā he had sayde thus: he smote Gerarde through the quyras, and throughe y<SUP>e</SUP> sheelde so great a strooke, that he he∣wed the shouldre and the arme with all from the body &amp; felled hym down dead to the erth afore hys feete, and than sayd to him. Certes Gerarde it had be better for you that ye had not come hytherwarde, for to the kynge Charlemayne now shal ye not beare your boste that ye haue slayne one of the foure Sonnes of Aymon. And whan he had sayd that: he fel downe in a swonne, and whan he was come agayne to hymselfe: he began for to wisshe after hys brethern, and com∣playned them sore, sayinge. O Rey∣nawde fayre brother this daye shall departe our company. For I shal ne¦uer see you, nother ye me. O Castell of Mountawban I cōmende thee to god that he wil by his mercy &amp; pitie bringe agayne your lorde saufe and sounde of his body. Ha king yon of Gascoygne, whye haue ye betrayed
<PB N="lxix" REF="74"/> vs? and taken vs to the kyng Char∣lemayne: certes ye dyd therin greate syn, and ashamfull fault, and after he sayd all weeping. O father king of glory, and lorde of al the worlde, succoure this day my poore brether∣ne. For I wot not where they ben, nor of me they may neyther haue he∣lpe nor succors, for I am all redy for to dye.</P>
<P>NOwe shall I tell you of Rey∣nawde of Alarde, and of Gui¦charde that faught strongly agaynst theyr enemies, as worthy knightes that they were. But all theyr great faytes of armes should auayled thē nothinge yf they had not come to a narowe way of the Roche, where men myght not come to them but a fore. And whan they had be longe there: Reynawde began to say to his brother Alarde, Brother where is be¦come our brother Richarde that we saw not of a good whyle a goe? now thinke none other but that we shall neuer see him, for I left him heere bi thys sapyn tree, whan ye and I had so much to doo. I praye god yf he be dead that he haue his soule. Now I wyl wit tidinges of him yf it be pos∣sible. Brother sayd Alarde yf ye wyll beleue me ye shall abyde heere, God pardon him if he be dead, for we mai not helpe him the perill is to greate and I beleue that we should dy afore that euē were come. Ha brother sayd Reynawde shall we fayle to our bro¦ther Richarde the good knight and worthy? Than sayde Alarde, what will ye that we shall doo therto? for as to me I knowe no remedy to it. Alas sayde Reynawde ye speake fo∣lyshly, for I should not doubt for fe∣re of death to wit where he is becom And if I should goe alone, yet shall I vnderstand some tidinges of him. Brother said Alarde I promise you if we depart the one from the other: We shall neuer see vs agayne toge∣ther. Brother sayd Reynawde other dead or all quicke, I shall finde him where so euer he be it maye none o∣ther be, and whan Reynawde had sayde these wordes: he spurred hys horse wyth his spurres, and cam at the other side of the roche. And whā they that had chased Richarde there for to slea him saw Reinawde come: they smote hemselfe to flight, &amp; than Reynawde wente a lytle more vp∣warde vpon the roche, and founde there his brother Richarde that laye nyghe dead vpon the ground, &amp; helde his bowelles betwene his handes, and about him were a great numbre of folke which he had slayne. Whan Reynawde saw him dead and so sore wounded: he had of it so great sorow at hys hert that almoste he fell down dead to the grounde but he tooke co∣rage and cam nighe his brother and lyghted downe from his horse &amp; kis∣sed him sore weeping and sayd. Ha fayre brother it is great pitie &amp; dom∣mage of you and of your death for certes neuer man was worthe you, for yf ye had come to mans age ne∣uer Rowlande nor Olyuer were so prue in knighthode, as ye shuld haue be. Alas now is lost our beauty and our youthe thorough greate synne. O good lorde who should euer haue thought y<SUP>e</SUP> onye treason should haue
<PB REF="75"/> entred into the hert of the king yon? Alas my brother Rycharde woe is me for your death, for I am cause of it. Alas thys daye in the mornynge whan wee departed out of Moun∣tawban we were foure bretherne al good knightes, now are we but .iii. that ben perillousli wounded and al vnarmed. Nowe God forbed that I should scape sythe that ye be dead v∣pon the traytours. But I pray god that I may venge your death vpon them or euer I deceasse. For I shall set therto my good will, &amp; if god will it shalbe so. Euen thus as Reinawde made mone ouer hys brother: he be∣helde behynde hym and sawe come his brethern Alarde and Guycharde all discomfyted, that cryed vpō Rey∣nawde. Brother what doo you? com anon and help vs for we haue great need. And whan Richarde heard the voyce of Alarde: he opened his eyen, and whan he saw his brother Rey∣nawde afore hym: he sayd to hym. O brother Reinawde and what doo you heere? see ye yonder that roche which is so hyghe and so stronge, where as ben manye small stones aboue, yf we myght doo so muche that we cli∣med vp there: I beleue that we shold be safe from our enemies, for it can∣not be but our cosyn Mawgys kno∣weth our disease by thys: and he shal come to succour vs. Brother sayde Reynawde wolde god we were there now tell me my fayre brother howe feele ye your selfe? thinke ye that ye maye recouer healthe? yea sayde Ry∣charde yf ye scape and els not, for w<SUP>t</SUP> the sore that I haue, I myght well dye for sorowe.</P>
<P>ANd whan Reynawde heard Richarde speake th{us}: he was ryght glad of it. So called he Alard to him and sayde. Brother take Ry∣charde vpon your sheelde, and lede hym vpon the roche, and Guicharde and I shall rowme the waye a fore you, brother sayde Alarde, doubt not I shall doo my power. And than he lighted downe and tooke vp Richard and layde hym vpon hys sheeld, and after he lighted againe on horsbacke and Reynawde and Guycharde leyd hym with his brother vpon the horse necke, and after put them selfe afore to breake the prece of the Frenche∣mē. And they did so muche that they came to the roche. But wyt it well that Reynawde made there so great faytes armes, that all hys enemyes were meruaylled with all. For he slewe at that tyme wel thyrty knigh∣tes, that neuer wylde Bore, nor ty∣gre, nor Lyon, nor Bere dyd y<SUP>t</SUP> Rey∣nawde made there of his body. But for to say the trouthe: Reynawde set∣ted nought by his lyfe, and ieoparde himself al together, for he was as a man desperate. And whan they were come to the roche, Alarde set downe his brother Rychard to the erth. And began to defende quyckly, but I wot not how they might endure, for they had nother Castell nor fortresse, but onlye the roche.</P>
<P>ALl thus as the three brethern defended theymselfe wyth greate woe. Than came there Ogier
<PB N="lxx" REF="75"/> the dane and hys folke, and had in his company Magon of Frise with well a thousande knyghtes, &amp; cryed vpon Reynawde. Certes knight ye shalbe dead wee haue sworne your death. This day is the departyng y<SUP>t</SUP> ye &amp; your brethern shall suffre death Ye did as fooles whan ye beleued the kynge You, for he hath put you all to death. Whan Alarde saw so great folke come: he was sore an angred, and sayd to Guycharde. See howe great a sorow is heere afore vs, and the great nombre of folke that be re¦dy for to slea vs foure knightes. cer∣tes yf we were fyue hundred wel ar∣med yet should not we scape, for they ben wel armed and a great quantiti of knightes. Surely sayd Guichard heere is a meruaylouse companye, but yf God helpe vs nowe: wee ben com to y<SUP>e</SUP> ende of our dayes. It is no great dommage of me nother of Ri∣charde, but the great dommage is of Reynawde that is the best knyghte of the worlde. And whan Alarde and Guycharde had spoken togyder: they wente to Reynawde and kyssed him full sore wepynge, and sayde vnto hym O brother Reynawde giue vs a gyfte yf it please you for the loue of oure lorde God. Lordes sayde Rey∣nawde what thynge aske you of me? ye know wel ynough that I can not helpe you of no thing, and thys day muste I needes see you dye before min eyen.</P>
<P>BRother said Alarde, Herke what we wyll tell you, and yf it please you ye shall doo it. Say on hardely sayde Reynawde. Brother sayde A∣larde men sayen comenly that it is better to doone one harme: than two I say thys bycause y<SUP>t</SUP> if ye dye heere: it shalbe great dommage, &amp; the losse shal neuer be recouered agayne, for none shall auenge your death, but though we dye heere and not you: it shalbe no great domage, for ye shal auenge vs wel, and therfore we pray you sweet brother for al the pleasu∣res that ye wolde doo euer to vs, y<SUP>t</SUP> ye wyll goe your wayes, and wee shall abyde heere. And whan y<SUP>e</SUP> death shal come; we shall take it a worthe. This that we say ye may well doo: for ye be well horsed, and ye shal wel saue your selfe maugre the Frenche men, yf they goe to Mountawban, &amp; whan ye be at Mountawban: lyght vpon Bayarde well armed, &amp; bringe anon wyth you our cosyn Mawgys for to succour vs. Brother sayd Rei∣nawde, ye speake to folyshlye. Cer∣tes I wolde not doo so for all the golde of the worlde. I should be sore bad and full vnkynde yf I dyd so, for I coulde not spyll my selfe souer than for to leaue you in so great pe∣ryll. Other we shall all scape: or els we shal all dye together, for the one shall not fayle the other as longe as we may lyue, now God that suffred death and passion saue vs. Thus as Reynawde spake to hys bretherne: came the erle Guymarde to whome God gyue euyl aduenture, and sayd to Reynawde, knight ye be take and ye must dye wyth shame vpon thys roche. Whan ye beleued the kynge You ye dyd great foly. He wrought great treason whan he dyd sell you to the kynge Charlemayne that ha∣teth
<PB REF="76"/> you so muche, for ye loued hym more, than ye dyd your cosin Maw∣gys. He hath well rewarded you for the great loue that ye ought to him, tell me Reynawde whether ye wyll yeeld you or defēde you? Certes sayd Reynawde now speke ye for nought, I shall neuer yeeld me as longe as I am a liue. Reynawde sayd than, O∣gyer what wyll ye doo? wee cannot helpe you of nothynge, other gyue your selfe vp: or defende your selfe, Ogyer sayd Reynawde, by hym that made the worlde I shall neuer yeeld me. I was neuer no theefe and ther∣fore wyl I not be hanged, I haue le∣uer dye like a knyght than to hange lyke a theefe. Lordes sayd Guimard let vs sawte them, for they shall not may kepe longe agaynst vs. Lordes sayd Ogyer ye maye well sawte thē if ye wil, but bi my soule I shal doo thē nothyng, for they ben my cosins nor I shall not helpe theym. For ye shall take them well wythout me. Certes sayd y<SUP>e</SUP> Frenche men, we shall than assayle them worthely. Than Ogyer drewe hymselfe and all hys folke a syde, wel the length of a bow shot, and began to make so great so∣rowe as thoughe all the worlde had finisshed afore hys eyen, and all hys sorow was for Reynawde hys co∣syn and for hys brethern, and thus as he made his mone: he began for to saye. Ha fayre cosin Reynawde it is great pitie of your death. And I vnhappy mā that am of your kynne suffre you to dye afore myne eyen, &amp; yet I cannot helpe you, for I haue it promysed to Charlemayne, nor I ought not for to breake myne othe. But the historye telleth that Ogyer duaange himselfe greatly that day, And through his purchace the foure sonnes of Aymon scaped. For yf he wolde haue put payne to it: they should not haue scaped by no maner but as men sayd. True bloud maye not lye.</P>
<P>BEfore the roche were foure Er∣les, for to sawte the foure Son∣nes of Aymon, and made them mo∣che a doo. For theyr folke sawted thē in foure partyes. Wherof Reynawde kepte the two partes: and Alarde &amp; Guycharde kepte the other tweyne. For Richarde lay downe vpon the erth sore wounded, as I tolde you a∣fore. And yet was Guicharde woū∣ded sore throughe the thye wherof he had bled so longe y<SUP>t</SUP> ye was feynt and fell downe to the erth. And whā he sawe that he myght no more de∣fend: he began to cal vpō Reynawde and sayde. Ha Reynawde fayre bro∣ther, let vs yeeld vs I pray you, for I nor Richarde maye no more helpe you. Brother sayd Reynawde what say you? now shew ye wel that ye be ferdfull, but I let you wyt that yf I trowed to scape other for Golde, or for Syluer or for Citie or for Castel¦les, or my horse Bayarde that I lo∣ue so muche: I should haue yeeld me prisoner to daye in y<SUP>e</SUP> mornynge. For ye wot well that yf we ben take that all the golde that is in all the worlde saue vs not fro hangynge, or some other shamefull death, and therfore I wyll not yeeld me by no maner of wyse. A man that wylbe valyaunte
<PB N="lxxi" REF="76"/> ought to defende hymselfe for to be whole. Ha Richarde succour vs for the loue of Iesus, for wee haue well mistre: we ben nother Normās nor Bretons, but we ben all of one fa∣ther and of one mother. Now ought we well to helpe eche other with all our power for our worship, for other wyse men should say that we ben ba∣stardes, and of an yll father. ye saye trouthe sayde Guicharde. But ye wolde not beleue how feble I am, for I am wounded to the death.</P>
<P>Certes sayde Reynawde, I am sory for it, but I shall defende you as longe as life is in my bodi, who had seen than the noble knight Reinawd take vp the great stones, and cast thē vpon hys enemyes: ye wolde not haue sayd that he had not be woūded nor trauayled of nothing. Whan Ri∣charde (that lay a ground thus woū∣ded as I haue tolde you aboue) saw and heard the great noyse that they that sawted the roche made: he tooke vp his head and sayd to Reynawde. Brother I shall helpe you. But cut me some of my sherte, &amp; I shal binde my syde and wounde so that my bo∣welles may not yssue out of my beli and than I shal set me to mi defence and shall helpe you with al my hert. Than sayd Reynawde, nowe art y<SUP>u</SUP> well worthe a true man. And whan Guycharde vnderstoode hym: he was a shamed and tooke agayne strength in him beyonde hys power and came to the defence and sayde w<SUP>t</SUP> a high voice Ogier fayre cosin what doo you to your lynage? Certes it shalbe a great shame to you yf ye suc¦cour vs not, for the faute that ye doo to vs: shall be layde vnto you in euery place where ye goe, to let vs dye thus we that ben your kynnes∣men, the best of all the worlde, saue Reynawde &amp; ye shall doo like a true man, and as for vs other: it maketh nother lesse nother more. Whan O∣gier vnderstode these wordes: he was sory for it, that no man might more, and wolde haue gyue a great thing for to haue deliuered them. And said that he wolde doo wyth all his herte all that he might doo for them. And thā Ogyer spurred Brayforde with his spurres and came to the roche w<SUP>t</SUP> a staffe in his hande, and sayde to thē that sawted the roche: wythdraw your selfe a litle tyll I haue spoken wyth them a litle, for to wyt whe∣ther they wyll giue them selfe vp or no. For it is better that we haue thē quicke than dead. Sir sayd the Fren¦che men we shal doo your commaū∣dement. But wee leaue them wyth you to keep in the name of the kynge Charlemayne. Ha god sayd Ogier I neuer thought treasō, nor I shal not begyn yet. And than he came more nighe the roche than he had be, and called to hym the foure Sonnes of Aymon, and sayd to theym. Fayre cosyn rest you, and take agayne your brethe, and yf ye be hurt: wrappe vp your woundes, &amp; make good garnis∣shinge of stones, &amp; so defende youre selfe nobly of al your power, for if y<SUP>e</SUP> king Charlemayne may haue you: ye shall neuer haue pardonne, but he shal make you to be hanged &amp; stran∣gled, and therfore ye muste needes
<PB REF="77"/> kepe your selfe well. For I promise you yf Mawgis know of it: he shall come to soccoure you, thus shall ye scape. &amp; other wyse not. Cosen sayd Alarde, ye shall haue of it a good re∣warde yf euer we may scape, ye saye true sayde Reynawde. For yf I mai scape bi god that suffred death &amp; pas∣syon for vs vpon the Crosse, all the golde of the world shal not saue him but I shall slea hym wyth myne own handes, for I hate hym much more than I doo a straunger. For he that should helpe and defende me agaynst all men it is he that doth me harme Cosyn sayd Ogyer I maye not doo therto, so helpe god my soule. For y<SUP>e</SUP> kyng Charlemayne made me swere afore all hys barons that I should not helpe you in no maner of wyse. And of this that I doo, I am sure y<SUP>e</SUP> the kynge Charlemayne shall conne me no thanke. Brother sayd Alarde Ogyer telleth you trouth. And also it was well trouth that Ogyer was repreued therof for treason, for char∣lemaine called him traitour afore al his barons. Than Reynawde boū<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the woūdes of his bretherne as wel as he could. But the wounde of ry∣charde was so greefully to see that it was pitie to beholde, for all the en∣trayles appered oute of hys bodye. And whan he had lapped theym al: Alarde wrapped the wounde that Reynawde had in the thyghe, and whan they had rested themself a litle Reynawde stoode vp and went vpon the roche for to gather stones to de∣fende them self. And garnysshed ther w<SUP>t</SUP> theyr defence where his bretherne should stande. Whan the Frenchemē sawe y<SUP>e</SUP> Ogyer the Dane made there to longe a soiournynge: they began all to call and crye. Ogyer ye make there to longe a Sermon, tell vs yf they wyll yelde them or no, or yf they shall defende themselfe. Naye sayde Ogyer as longe as they haue lyfe in theyr bodyes. By my soule sayde the Frenche men than go we sawte them efte agayne. Than sayde Ogier I promise you I shal helpe them with all my power. Whan the Erle Guy∣marde hearde Ogyer speake so: he wente to hym &amp; sayd. We commaūde you in the kinges name of Fraunce that ye come to the batayle wyth vs agaynst the foure sonnes of Aymon as ye haue promised and sworne, &amp; for doubt of you many a lord is here in your company that wyll not fy∣ght. Lordes sayd Ogyer for god mer¦cy, ye know wel al redy they ben my cosyns germanye. I pray you let vs withdrawe our selfe a backe, and let them be in peace, and I shall gyue eche of you large goodes, Ogier said the frenche men we shall not doo so, but we shall brynge them prysoners to the kynge Charlemayne that shal doo with them hys pleasure, and al∣so we shall tell him what ye haue do∣one. Wherof he shall conne you lytle thanke all his life. And after whan Ogier vnderstode these wordes: he was sore an angred &amp; sayde by great wrathe. By the fayth that I owe to al my freendes if there be ani of you so hardy that take Reynawde or any of this brethern for to delyuer them to king Charlemayne I: shall smyte of his head, what some euer come af∣ter it. Ogier sayd y<SUP>e</SUP> Erle Gūymarde
<PB N="lxxii" REF="77"/> we shal not leue therfore for to take them ryght shortly. And whan we haue them: we shal see who shal take them from vs, for we shall well can shewe this to the king Charlemain. And than they began to sawt the ro∣che agayne. Wit it that Reynawde &amp; hys brethern defended themfelf full nobly. But whan Reynawde sawe this great multytude of folke that came for to sawte them: he began to saye. Ha Mawgis my fayre cosyn where are ye now that ye knowe not thys myshap? for ye wolde come a∣non to helpe vs: but ye know it not, wherof I am euyll contente. For I was a foole and ouer hasty that I spake not to you of thys matter a∣fore that I came heere. Ha Bayarde yf I were vpon your backe I should neuer entre w<SUP>t</SUP>in this roche for feare of the frenchemen, but y<SUP>e</SUP> king Char∣lemayne should lese heere of the best knyghtes of his company, &amp; whan he had sayde this: he began to weepe full tenderly for the loue of his bre∣thern, y<SUP>t</SUP> he saw so sore wounded and &amp; so werye. Than the Frenchemen sawted them efte as stronge agayne &amp; I promise you if it had not be the greate prowes of Reynawde: they should haue ben takē at that time by fine force. Whan the sawtinge was finisshed: Reynawde set himself vpō his defence, for he was so wery that if he had gone he should haue fallen downe to the erthe, so weke he was and that was no meruayle: for they had so sore trauayled him, &amp; had suf∣fred so many tormentes and terrible sawtes that it was wunder y<SUP>t</SUP> they coulde endure so longe.</P>
<P>ANd whan Ogyer the Dane saw his Cosin so sore tormē∣ted: he tooke himself to weepe tender∣ly. And thus as he wept: he bethou∣ght him selfe of a great wysedome &amp; called to hym a knight of hys that was named Gerarde &amp; sayd to hym, haue for god mercy of me. and but yf ye doo that I shall tel you: I am dis∣honoured for euer more. Syr sayde Gerade tell me what it please you for it shall be doo thoughe I should lose my life.

<P>NOw sheweth the hystory that whan Godarde saw Reynaw∣de and his brethern go to theyr death thorough so false a treason: he had of it great sorowe and pitie, and he was ryght sory for it, for two pryn∣cipal causes, wherof thone was for his mayster the kynge Yon, that had wrought that shamefull treason: and the other was for the great pitie and domage y<SUP>t</SUP> it was for to make die so pitiously suche worthy knyghtes as the foure sonnes of Aimon were. So began he to weep pitiously, and thus as he wept, came there Maw∣gys the cosyn of the foure sonnes of Aymon that went to the kechyn for to haste the meate, for the kinge Yon wolde eate, to the whyche men made good cheere, bycause they knew not the treason that he had doone. Whan the clerke sawe Mawgys: he called hym, and sayd to hym. Ha Mawgys how it is yl with you? for if god put no remedy in you ye haue loste that
<PB N="lxxiii" REF="78"/> thyng y<SUP>t</SUP> ye moste loue in thys worlde that is Reynawde and hys brethern for the kyng Yon hath betrayed thē shamefully. And than he shewed to hym all the treason, whan Mawgys vnderstode these wordes: he was all out of his wittes &amp; sayd to the clerke Godarde for god go awaye fro me, for all my limmes shaken for angre nor I cannot stande vpon my feete, for mi hert telleth me that Reinawde and hys brethern ben dead. Certes sayd Godarde ye sai trouth. For the lettre sheweth that Ogyer the dane and Foulques of Morillon are set in a busshemēt with a great numbre of folke in the plaine of Valcolours and Reynawde and his brethern are gone thyther al vnarmed by the coū∣sell of kyng Yon, and thus they can∣not defende, but they muste be dead or takē. Whā Mawgis vnderstoode thys: he was sorye for it that he fell downe in a swoune to therth, and at the fallyng that he made he brake all hys browes. And whan he was com agayne to himselfe, he was so sory y<SUP>t</SUP> he wyst not what he should doo. So tooke he a knife and wolde haue sho¦ued it in hys breste, but he myght not for Godarde tooke hym by the hand and sayd to hym. Ha gentyll knyght haue mercye vpon you, kyll not your selfe, for your soule shalbe dāp∣ned for it, but light a horsbacke and take wyth you all the men of armes that ben within and the good horse bayarde that renneth so fast, and goe there as your cosyns ben gone as soone as ye may. And whan ye com there, ye shal see anon yf ye can helpe them or not, for yf they ben alyue: ye shall succour theym ryght wel. Go∣darde sayd Mawgys your coūsel is right good, and thā he began to weep and said. Ha noble knight Reynawd it is great dommage yf ye be dead, but I make my vowe to God that if ye and your brethern be dead: I shall neuer liue two dayes after you. And than Mawgys without any noyse or onye worde to be made of this to kyng Yon nor to his syster the wife of Reynawde: cōmaunde all the sol∣diours of the castell to be redy in ar∣mes lightly, and whan the knightes vnderstode hym: they tooke theyr har¦neys on in contynent as they were wōt to doo. And whan they were all armed thei came al to the lowest part of the palays and presēted themself, and whan Mawgys saw them: he shewed to them all the treason that the king you had doone to Reynawde and to his brethern.</P>
<P>THen whan the Knightes of Reynawde vnderstode thys: they begā to make suche sorow that it was pity for to see, &amp; wisshed after the noble knightes that were gone to theyr death, &amp; were sore desperat that they wolde almost haue killed them selfe. For the one wysshed after Rey∣nawde &amp; the other after Alarde the other after Guycharde &amp; thother af∣ter Richarde, &amp; sayd. Ha valiaunt &amp; prue knyghtes it is great domage of your death, for certaynly al y<SUP>e</SUP> world shalbe y<SUP>e</SUP> worse therfore. Alas &amp; who shall giue vs now the fayre armes &amp; the good horses y<SUP>t</SUP> ye were wonte to giue vs, thus as they were makyng this great sorow: mawgis sayd to y<SUP>e</SUP>
<PB REF="79"/> palfrainier y<SUP>t</SUP> kept Bayarde, freende goe and set the sadle vpon Bayarde and I shall bryng hym to Reynawd, syr sayd the palfraynier. I maye not doo it, for Reynawde my mayster cō¦maunded me whan he went that I should not suffre no body to lyght v∣pon it till he were come agayne, whā Mawgys vnderstode the answere of the palfraynyer: he was wroth, and smote hym wyth hys fyste so greate a stroke that he cast him at his foote afore hym and after went hymselfe to the stable where Bayarde was. Whan Bayarde saw Mawgis: he be¦gan to shrinke hys eares and smote with his forfeete so stronge that no body durst go nighe him, but the pal¦fraynyer that tended vpon him, and whan Mawgys saw that Bayarde plaied so he tooke a staffe and smote bayarde vpon the head so y<SUP>t</SUP> he made him kneele to y<SUP>e</SUP> erth. And whan bay∣arde sawe he was so curstly dealed w<SUP>t</SUP> all: he was aferde least he should be yet more shrewdely handled and so he helde hymselfe styll, &amp; Mawgys caste the sadle vpon hym and bridled hym. And wyt it that whan Maw∣gys was vpon bayardes backe: he was wel lyke a valyaunt man and a hardy knyght, for he was one of y<SUP>e</SUP> fayrest knightes of the worlde and one of the best, and the moste subtyll of the worlde. And whan Mawgys and al his folke were al redy a horse backe well armed: they went out at the gate fawcon. And they myght well be aboute fyue thousande men well horsed and well armed, and .vii hondred good archers y<SUP>t</SUP> neuer wold go backe for no doubte of death by any maner, and they set themselfe to the way, not by the ryght waye: but wente throughe y<SUP>e</SUP> wood al a couerte wyth great diligence, and alwayes Mawgys went wisshyng after rey∣nawde and after hys bretherne, for he wyste not yf they were dead or a lyue, and sayd to hymselfe. Ha Rey∣nawde God be thys day wyth you, &amp; keep you &amp; your bretherne fro death and fro pryson. But now yf the frē∣che men keep not themselfe wel: they shall haue suche a neyghbour and so cruell that they shalbe soone wery of it and shall sore repente. ¶ Now shall wee leaue to speake of Maw∣gis y<SUP>t</SUP> brought succours to Reinaw¦de to the playne of Valcolours: and we shall shewe of Reynawde and of hys brethern y<SUP>t</SUP> were at roche Moūt∣bron full of wo &amp; sory, for they sawe themselfe in great perill. Al thus as Reynawde dyd reste himselfe vpon the defence of the roche and thought in hymselfe what he myght doo: he turned his sight towarde the wood and saw come Mawgis w<SUP>t</SUP> his folke the sheelde at the necke the swerde in the hande and mounted vpon Bay∣arde, wyt it that bayarde wente not the lytle pase but wente lyke a swa∣lowe, for at euerye lepe that he made he lept thirty foote of grounde. And whan Reynawde sawe Mawgys come with so great folke &amp; so fayre a company: all his body sheuered all sodeynlye for great ioye, and forgat all the great sorowe &amp; torment that he had suffred all the daye and sayde to his brethern. Brethern be merye and be not dysmayed of nothynge, for here cometh Mawgis to succour
<PB N="lxxiiii" REF="79"/> vs with great nombre of folke, now he sheweth well that he is our kyns∣man and a good freend, blessed be he of god that hath tolde him the daun∣ger that we were in.

Certes said Alarde nowe complaine I not. And whan Richarde that laye wyth his bowelles betwen his handes vn¦der stoode this word: him semed that he dreamed this that he heard which his brethern said, for he was al rea∣die brought as one that had lost hys braine, by cause of the great sore that he felte and forced himselfe so that he ryghted himselfe vpon his buttocke bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it was with great paine, &amp; sayde to his brother Reinawde me semeth that I haue hearde named Mawgis or elles it is come to me by a visyon, brother said Reinawde by my faythe we haue socours of Mawgis that bringeth to vs al the power of Moū∣tawban. Brother said Richarde for god shewe me hym. And than Rey∣nawd tooke him betwene his armes and shewed him Mawgis that came rydynge vpon Bayarde as faste as tempest, whan Richarde sawe maw∣gys: he was so gladde that he fell in a swoune betwene his brothers ar∣mes. And whan he was come againe to himself: he said. Now am I whole for I fele nother yll nother sore, bro∣ther Reinawd said Alard, what shall we doo? for if the frenshmē perceiue the comming of Mawgis: they shal flee, and I wolde for no good that they should doo so, for I wolde that we were firste auenged vpon theym for the great hurt that thei haue doon to vs, but let vs doo one thyng that I shall tel you. Let vs goe downe to the foote of the roche and begyne the battayle, &amp; while that they shal fight with vs: Mawgis shal be come, and by all thus they shall not scape vs, brother said Reinawde ye say well and we shal doo so, &amp; than Reinawd, Alard and Guicharde wente downe to the foote of the roche, and the litell Rycharde bod aboue vpon the roche for he coulde not moue nother helpe himselfe.</P>
<P>REinawde came downe from the roche with his two breth∣ren, And whan the frenshemen sawe them: they began to saie thone to tho∣ther. Here cometh the sōnes of Aimō that will yeeld themselfe prisoners, now let vs not kylle them but take we theym for to bringe theim alyue to themperour Charlemayne. And whan they had sayd this: they began to cry. Reynawde but yf ye wyll die shortly: yeeld your selfe and if ye doo it with good will: we shall all praye Charlemain that he haue mercy vp∣on you. Whan Ogier heard theim speake thus: he wend it had be trouth that Reinawde &amp; his breth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n wold haue giuen themselfe vp as pryso∣ners. So was he full sory for it, and spurred brayforde with the spurres &amp; came ayenst Reinawd and his bre∣therne and saide to them: knyghtes I holde you nowe for fooles that ye haue left your roche that was the sa∣uing of your life, this day shall ye be hanged with great shame, and yet I can not help you, for I should be bla∣med
<PB REF="80"/> of Charlemain. Ogier said Rei∣nawde we ben not such fooles as ye wene, but I will that ye flee. For by the faithe that I owe to the olde Ay∣mon my father yf ye tarye any whyle heere ye shall not be wise, for if I can reche vnto you. I shall shewe what I can doo.</P>
<P>THis hanging: that Reinawd spake to Ogyer: Ogier be helde towarde the ryghte waye that came to the wood &amp; sawe folke come to Reinawd that Maugis brought, and was all afore mounted vpon Bayard that came fast. And whan Ogier sawe come thus the folke of Reinawd in great numbre: he knew them well, &amp; was righte glad of it, &amp; his herte rored in his bely for Ioye, and righted himselfe vp in his sadle wel halfe a foote &amp; sayd to his folke. Fayre lordes what shal we doo? the deuyll hath tolde Mawgis that we be heere, he cometh ryding vpon bai∣arde &amp; bryngeth wyth hym a fayre company, certes if we were .xx. thou∣sande yet were we not able to fyghte with them, and ye shall see thys day that the sorowe shall returne vpon vs. This hangyng came Mawgis with al his felowship, &amp; there wher he saw Ogier: he came to him and sayde. Ogier I holde you for a foole bycause that ye came heere to werke treason. I chalenge of you Reinawd and his brethren, and am come heere to be theyr suretie. By god Ogier it longeth not to you for to betray thus Reynawd &amp; his bretherne, for ye be of his lignage but ye haue yl shewed it to him, your father wrought neuer treason, &amp; I meruayll me sore howe ye wold graunt to it, your father left you in Fraunce for a pledge at saynt Omers to Charlemain, whose man ye are, paying to him euery yere foure peny weyght of golde. Ogyer ye be desended of damp Richarde, of Rou∣sillon, of Dron of Nantuel, of the du∣ke Benes of Aygremounte, al these were bretherne &amp; good true men and faithful knightes, and Aimō of dor∣don was theyr brother and is father to Reinawd, this knowe ye well and ye will be other than was your lyg∣nage wherof I defy you to the death for I hate you vtterly. Whan Maw∣gis had sayd this worde: he spurred bayard with his spurres &amp; smot O∣gier in the shelde so harde that the sheld nor his harneys could not saue him but that he made him a greate woūd in his brest, and of that stroke flough the spere in peces, whan O∣gier sawe that he was so sore an an∣gred for it that: he wexed almost mad, &amp; wold haue gon vpō Mawgys but he might not. For whā baiard smel∣led his lord: he ran mightely toward him, wold he or no, &amp; whan he was come before Reinawd: he kneeled be¦fore him, &amp; Maugis lighted frō him &amp; came to Reinawde &amp; kissed him ful swetly, &amp; after he kissed Alarde, and Guicharde, &amp; than said, where is the lytel Rycharde? For men helde hym for one of the most hardy of the world Cosyn sayd Reinawde he is there a∣boue sore wounded that I wote not whether he be dead or alyue, cosyn sayd Mawgys can not he moue him selfe? it is not time to speake so long said Reinawd, but let vs se who shal doo best, &amp; gyue me mine armes, with
<PB N="lxxv" REF="80"/> a good will sayde Maugys, &amp; than Reinawde armed hym and lyghted vpon bayarde the shelde at the necke and the spere in the hande, and whā he had sayd this: he spurred Baiard with his spurre, &amp; lept at euerie tym me .xxx. foote of length. Whan Rey∣nawde sawe hymselfe vpon bayrad: he was ryght gladde, for he trowed neuer to haue set vpon his backe a∣gayne, and whan he sawe himselfe thus horsed &amp; armed with his owne armures: so held himselfe more sure, than that he hadde be in the mayster towre of Mountawban, and than he made a course and ranne vpon Ogi∣er and smote hym so hearde that he made hym lyghte fro the sadle, and bare hym fyerslye to the grounde. And whan Reynawde sawe Ogyer a groūd: he lyghted a foote and tooke the horse of Ogyer and brought it to him againe, and helde the styroppe and made Ogier to lyght vpon brai∣ford againe, and than Reinawd said to hym, Cosyne Ogyer now haue ye the rewarde of the goodnes that ye did vnto vs, but certes this that ye haue don ye did it as a traytoure and an ill kynsmanne, therfore keep you from me for I defie you, and by him that made the worlde I shall spare you no more, for ye are slaundred.</P>
<P>COsyn Reinawde sayde Ogyer and we shall keep vs fro you doubte ye not. Who than hadde be in that place: he shoulde haue seen howe Reynawde had medled him selfe vy∣goriously among the frenshemenne, and myght well saye that he was a knight prue and valyaunt. And thā came Mawgys vpon a nother horse that he had recouered and spurred him with his spurres, and came to y<SUP>e</SUP> earle Guymard and smote him tho∣rughe the sheeld so that he shoued his speare through and through his bo∣die, and feld him doune deade to the earthe. And whan he had gyuen that stroke: he cryed Mountawban clere mount, and after he said in this maner, free knightes smite vpō this frenshemen that wolde slea the best knightes of the world, they haue wel shewed great worthines whan they be com hither in great numbre for to fighte ayenst foure knightes vnar∣med, but they shall repente theym of theyr bargane right sore or that two howres been a goe, and therfore leye strongly vpon theym and as harde as ye can, for if Ogyer scape vs: we be dyshonoured, and than began the stryfe fell and cruell &amp; many a frensh man was cast down to the earth. For they might not endure the grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mer∣ueylles of armes that Reinawd and his brethren made. And whan the frenshmen sawe that they could not withstande no lenger: and sawe the great dommage and hurte that Rey∣nawd, his bretherne and Mawgys bare to theym: they put theymselfe to flighte &amp; Ogier with them towarde the riuer of Dordonne, and Ogyer passed it ouer vpō his horse braiford, and whan he was come at the other syde of the ryuer: be lyghted a foote, and Reinawd called in a scorne and sayde to hym. Ogyer I trowe ye be become a fyssher, haue ye eeles or sawmons? I gyue you leue to chuse
<PB REF="81"/> whether ye wyll come again at this syde: or that I goe to you at that sy∣de, and yf ye come agayne at thys syde: I shall keep you safe from all men but of me onelye, or elles make me sure fcom Charlemaynes folke and I shall iuste with you, and after said to him. Ye whoreson false knaue ye haue falsed your fayth to Charle∣mayne, for ye be my cosyn germaine And howe had ye the herte for to see vs be murdered in youre presence and that ye defended vs not ayenste all men, and ye come your selfe for to slea vs by treason. Certes Ogyer ye haue doon amys greatly. But than∣ked be god ye leaue with vs behynde you a good pledge.

And goddes curse haue they if they make not you to be han∣ged as a theef by the necke.</P>
<P>THenne were the frenshemen sore abashed whan thei heard Reynawde repreue Ogier so, wherof they were gladde and saide togither wel finde ye now the reward of your goodnes, if ye wold haue doone your deuoure: the foure sonnes of Aymon had be taken. And whan Ogyer saw himself thus repreued of the one part and of the other: he was ryghte sory for it. And than they lefte him vpon the ryuer syde of Dordon, and abode wyth hym but .x. menne. And whan Ogier sawe that all his companye had lefte hym: he knewe wel that they dyd so for dispite, than sayde he all by hymselfe. Fayre God of heauē I am wel worthy to be ser∣ued thus. And the prouerbe maye-well be rehersed for a trouthe, that sayth. Often happed euyl for a good turne. Whan Ogier had sayd this: he cryed &amp; saide to Reynawde. O mad beste ye blame me wrongefully and without a cause, for ye and your bre∣thern should haue be hanged by this without any pardonne, nor Maw∣gys hadde neuer come heere tyme y∣noughe, wherof ye haue called me traytoure, but ye lye falslye. For I neuer dyd treason nor neuer shall yf God wyll, ye haue also called me fis∣sher, nowe oughte I well to wexe mad all quicke whan such a glutton dooth to me so great outerage, but by the faythe that I owe to all my freendes, but if I feared other than you: I shoulde goe gyue you suche a stroke thoroughe the sheeld that ye shoulde saye it is a stroke of a may∣ster. Than sayd Reynawde, Ogier ye speake wel at your ease, for ye shal doo nothynge at all of that ye saye least your lymmes should be hurt, by my berde sayde Ogier I shall. And than he broched brayforde wyth the spurres and put hymselfe to swyme ouer the ryuer. And whan he was come to the playne grounde: he made hym ready for to iouste as were as he was. And whan Reynawd saw O∣gier so yll arayed for to fyght: he had pyte therof, and sayde to hym. Cosin I haue at this houre no wyll for to

Reynawd (sayde Ogier) mocke not with me, ye haue called me traitour before mani knigh¦tes, if I went my way again: menne might say to Charlemain that I had betraied him falslye. My spere is yet al whole, it were a great shame to me but I brake it vpon you or vpon one of your brethern. For Foulques and the earle Guimard should complain in helle vpō me, and of the other part I shoulde haue none excuse towarde the king Charlemain if I went thus awaye, for ye haue well slaine foure hundred knightes of ours, wherfore I say cor a conclusion that I shal not goe my waye, but that I medle first with you, for ye wot well that yf I went thus my way: the king Char∣lemaine should beare me some disho∣noure for it, and he shoulde haue rea∣sone &amp; also he shoulde make me to be headed, and therfore I wil fyght with you, for certes I haue leuer die than to returne thus to him, and yf God hathe ordeined that ye shall smite of my heade: I pardone you my death. for if I canne ouercome you: I shall bringe you to the king Charlemaine what someuer come of it.</P>
<P>ANd whan Reynawde hearde Ogyer speake so: he wexed all mad for angre and saide by wrathe, Ogier I defy you to the death &amp; keep you fro me, &amp; you of me said Ogyer. And whan they had defied eche other so Reynawde spurred Bayarde and Ogyer brayforde their good horses and ranne the one vpon the other so strongly that the earth trembled vn∣der their feet. And whan came for to laie the speres alowe: they hytte eche other so harde that they brake theyr speres, and after their speres were broken: they recoūted eche other with their sheeldes and gaue eche other so great strokes that they both fel down to the earth ouer their croper of theyr horses and were sore wounded. And whan the two good knightes sawe theimselfe at the grounde: they rose vp quickely and sette hande to theyr swerdes and began to make so harde medling that it was meruayle. But herke of their horses. Wit that what<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bayarde and brayforde sawe theyr maisters at the ground: incontynent they wēt the one to the other, and be∣gan to byte eche other and cast theyr feet the one vpon the other. Whan Ogyer sawe that: he was ful sory for it. for he knewe wel that bayard was the stronger, so ranne Ogyer thy∣ther the sheelde at his necke and hys swerde in his hand, for he wold help his good horse Braiford, for he was afearde that bayarde shoulde haue kylled hym. Whan Reynawde sawe thys: he cryed and sayde, what is it Ogyer that ye wyll doo? it is not the werke of a knighte to smite a beaste, and well me semeth that ye haue y∣noughe to doo of me wythout ye bete not my hors: Than Reinawde smot Ogyer so greate a stroke vpon his helme: that he feld hym downe vnto the grounde, but the stroke slyded a syde &amp; kut asunder all that it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought well an hundred maylles of hys

Ogier le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> alone Bayarde: for ye haue ynough a doo with me. I be∣leue that I haue appaired youre hel∣me, for I se your visage that is sore pale. And whan Ogier felte himself hurte: he wexed almost wood for an∣gre, and retourned to Reinawd with his swerde Cortyne and sayde. A cortine that so muche I haue loued thee and certes it is well reason, for ye be a good swerde and in manye places ye haue well holpen me &amp; ma∣ny a proude man ouerthrowen. And whan I went with y<SUP>e</SUP> king Charle∣maine at Estbroughe in Almayne, Rowlande, and Oliuer dyd assaye theyr swerdes at Petrō, and I smot after for to assaye you. And ye kut∣ted therof wel half a foote and there I brake you wherof I was ryghte sorye.

And thā he smot Reynawd vpō hys helme so hard that he made him ree∣le. And whan Ogier sawe Reinawd thus arayed: he sayde to him, by god Reinawde I haue yeeld you againe that ye had geuen me, we be nowe quite, wyll ye begyn a freshe? by my faythe saide Reynawd yea, for I de∣sire more to fyght than I doo any o∣ther thyng. And than they went and ranne the one vpon the other and be¦gan an nother medlynge, but than came there, Alarde, Mawgys, and Guycharde and all theyr folke. And whan Ogier sawe theim come: he was wrothe and sorye for it, and so want he againe vnto braiforde hys good horse and lighted vpon him, swymmed agayn ouer Dordon and whan he was ouer: he abode styll at the ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er side and lyghted downe to the earthe, but he had no sadle vpon hys horse, for the girthes brake whā he Iousted wyth Reinawde. Whan Reynawde sawe Brayforde saddel∣lesse: he called to Ogyer, and sayde Ogier come fetche youre sadle, for it shall be to you a greate shame yf ye ride thus, and thanke our lorde that ye be thus departed fro me withoute any more harme, for yf we had tary∣ed a litell lenger togither. I wolde haue brought you into suche a place where ye were neuer, for the kynge Charlemaine your lord should neuer haue rescued you in tyme. Reinaw∣de said Ogier, ye threten me of feare, it longeth not to a good knighte to threaten one so, but I wot well that yf it had not be your folke that haue succoured you: I wolde haue brought you to kynge Charlemaine or euyn. Ogier saide reinawde ye haue well shewed that ye be a good knyghte that passed the riuer of Dordon, for to come fight with me: but shall ye tary there for me tyll I passe ouer at the other syde vpon my horse bay∣arde, yea vpon my soule said Ogier, and yf ye doo it: I shall saye that ye be the best knyghte of the worlde. whan Reinawde vnderstoode that worde: he spurred bayarde with the
<PB N="lxxvii" REF="82"/> spurres &amp; wold haue passed ouer dor¦don, but Mawgis, Alard, and Gui∣charde letted him, and wolde not suf∣fre hym to goe, but tooke hym by the brydell, and Alarde saide to hym Ha fayre brother &amp; what is this that ye wil doo? ye be ouer hastye, for who that dooth you good: he leseth well his time, ye knowe well and Ogyer had not be: we should haue been dead this daie, and the succours of Maw∣gys had helped vs but litell. Lette Ogier be in peace I praye you, for there is not a better knighte in the worlde than he is one, and than cri∣ed Alarde to Ogier. Faire cosyn goe to god, for ye haue well holpen vs, whan Alarde had spoken to Ogyer: he returned him to his brother Rey∣nawde and saide to him. Faire bro∣ther me semeth it were good that we should turne backe againe for to wit howe oure brother Richarde doothe that abideth vpon the roche Mount∣bron so wounded as ye knowe. Let goe our enemies with shame ynough for we haue domaged theim righte sore. Than called Ogier to Reinaw∣de, and said, ye haue discomfited vs, but by my fathers soule, we shal com againe so greate folke vpon you that we shal beare to you greate harme and so shall we take the proye, the whiche ye shall not dare defende.</P>
<P>Now threten al fayre said Reinaw∣de, for we haue suche a castell where we dare well abide the kinge Char∣lemaine, and you at anye houre that ye come, and also I tell you for cer∣tain that or euer three daies be passed ye shall neuer take vs for all that ye can doo. And how someuer the ga∣me goeth, the losse hathe euer be vp∣on you vnto this time. And also ye shall beare no good tidinges to the king Charlemaine. And whan O∣gier had spoken ynoughe vnto Rei∣nawde: he spurred braiford and went after his folke that hadde lefte him and he rode so longe that he came to Mountbandell and lighted downe before the tente of the kinge Charle∣maine. And whan Rowland and O∣liuer sawe come Ogier thus woun∣ded and making so euill chere: they trowed that there hadde be a battaile and that Ogier had taken Reynawd and his brethrene, and so they dyd calle the Duke N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imes, Salomon of Breten, Richarde of Normandye and the earle Guidellon. And whan they were all assembled: they saide the one to the other. Poore vnhappy and what shal we doo? this day shall we see hanged the foure sonnes of Aymon, they be cosins to vs al, and if the king Charlemain maketh thē to be hanged: we be dishonoured for euer. And whan the king Charle∣mayne sawe come Ogier: he said to him, Ogier where ben the foure son∣nes of Aymon? haue ye taken them, or slaine theim, or remysed theim for prisoners? Sir saide Ogier all fayre and foftlye, wit it that they been no children: but they are the best knigh∣tes of the world, and they be alyue. I tell you sir that we founde them in the plaine of Valcolours, all foure clothed in scarlet furred with ermi∣nes and vpon mules, and bare in their handes floures, and roses, wel hath the king of Gascoygne kepte his couenaunt to you, for he hath sēt
<PB REF="83"/> theym forth in such maner as he pro∣mised to you, but the worthynes and the prowes was such: that they chaū∣ged theyr mules to good horses and recouered both sheelde and spere. And whan Reinawde had goten a horse: he slew Foulques of Moryllon first of all, and mounted vpon his horse, but at the last they found a roche cor∣uen after the maner of a caue that is a strong place, where they defended themsele a longe while, and Richard one of their bretherne had ben slaine, and the other three should haue bē o∣ther taken or slaine, and if Mawgis had not come there to succoure them mounted vpon bayard and broughte with him .v. thousande knyghtes which haue discomfited vs and haue slaine the Erle Guymarde.</P>
<P>HA said themperaur Charlemai∣ne is it true that they been so scaped? sir said Ogier, yea vere¦lye, whan the king vnderstoode that Reinawd and his brethern were sca∣ped: he was right wroth &amp; ful angry for it and said. A good lord of glorye, how am I shamed for foure gluttōs? certes this weries me sore, but no force let them doo the worst that they can for if they haue scaped me now: they shal not scape me another time, syr said Ogier wyt it, but if Maw∣gis had not be: they coulde not haue scaped, Goddes curse haue he for it said Charlemaine and an euyll yere, for often hathe he holpen them ayenst me, and so I wote well that yf I helde Reinawde and hys bretherne within my pryson. Mawgis should delyuer theym oute, and therfore I hate him to death, wherof I pray out lorde that I die not till I be fyrst a∣uenged of it, syr saide Ogier by the faith that I owe to you. Reinawde gaue me so greate a stroke that the corner of my helme fel downe wyth∣all to the earthe, and I promyse you I was wel glad whā I was escaped from his handes, for of three thou∣sand that we brought with vs: there are come againe but three hundred, &amp; the surples is all slaine other taken. Whan Rowland vnderstoode theyse wordes: he shooke al for angre &amp; said by great wrathe. By god syr Ogyer, ye were sore hardy ye had not felow∣es that dyd so well as ye dyd, but by saint Peter the apostle I sawe neuer so strong a cowarde as ye be, nor ne∣uer came oute of Denmarke a good knight. Ha whoreson coward kaytif howe haue ye anye eyen that dare be∣hold vpon a man? but another thing there is, for ye haue spared them, for they ben your cosins and your freen∣des. Now be the king blamed, but yf he maketh you to be hewen al to pee∣ces, for they should haue ben take yf ye had not be.</P>
<P>THan whan Ogyer sawe hym selfe so repreued: he wexed al mad of the great iniury that Rowlād hadde saide to him so, and answered boldlye and saide. Damp Rowlande ye lye falsly of that ye say. For I am not suche as ye tell. And heere is my pledge for to defende me this quarell ayenst body to bodye, for I nor none of my kinne dyd neuer amys ayenst Charlemaine, but of all Fraunce I am one of the best and truest knygh∣tes
<PB N="lxxviii" REF="83"/> that be in it, and of a better kinne I am come than ye be Rowlande, Ge∣rarde of roussyllon was mine vncle he kept me of a litell childe, &amp; Dron of Nantuell and the duke Benes of Aygremont these three were brethern the whiche were all myne vncles. And Myneus of aygremount was my father, and also the bishop Tur∣pyn and Richarde of normandye ben my kinsmen, and thus are they foure sōnes of Aimon of my lignage, now good syr Rowland tell me your lyg∣nage for I knowe youre hyghnes. For by sainte Denis of Fraunce, I shall defende me ayenst you with my swerde, and so shall I shewe to you yf I be true or no. Rowlande was than wonderful wroth whā he heard Ogier speake so: and vaunced him selfe ayenst him and wold haue smit∣ten him. And whan Ogier sawe him come: he set hande to his swerde cor∣tyne, and said to Rowland. Beware ye be not so hardy for to set hande vp¦on me, for by the faythe that I ow to hym that, begate me I shall make thy heade to flee fro thy bodye, yf ye come anye nerer. Whan Charle∣mayne saw these two barons moue themselfe so sore the one ayenst the other: he was ryght sory for it. And than rose the duke Naymes of baui∣ere &amp; the earle Aymerye, and sayde. Syr Rowland what wyll ye doo? by my heade the thynge shal not goe as ye trowe, for Ogyer is not suche as ye make him, and yf the kynge were not: the thyng shoulde goe otherwise than ye ween, Ogyer is suche a kni∣ght as al the world knoweth, nor in his lignage was neuer no man bor∣ne that made treason, but he is the best knighte in all Fraunce of all sy∣des. But we merueile howe Charle∣mayne suffreth you to take so greate a pryde vpon you, and if he suffereth it: we will not doo so for no thynge that can come of it. Whan Charle∣maine sawe this great noyse betwen hys barons: he was righte wrothe &amp; sayde to Rowland. Faire neuewe let this alone, for it longeth not to you to saye so, and betwene thys and to morowe I shal enquere of thys ma∣tere. And yf Ogyer hath doo amys in any thing ayenst me I shal make hym abyde it full deare, for all they in the worlde shall not keep him but shall make him be headed for it. Sir said Ogyer I wyll well, but there is in Fraūce no man so prue ne so har∣dy, that shall say that I haue doone treason ayenst you nor ayenste anye other, but that I shall fyghte ayenste hym in the quarell, and shall shewe to him that he lieth falsly, but and it please you to heare me: I shal tell you the trouthe of the matter, wyt it syr that whan I came to the roche Moūt bron where the foure sonnes of Ay∣mon were, and saw that we were so great numbre of folke ayenst foure knightes all vnarmed: I promyse you that I holp them not, nor I was not ayenst theym, but wythdrewe me a syde and lette the other shyfte with them, and I stoode styll and be∣helde vpon the greate sorowe. For I sawe dye my fleshe and my bloud, and I myghte not helpe them of no thyng, nowe haue I tolde you all the truthe and all that I dyd. And yf ye fynde otherwyse than that I tell
<PB REF="84"/> you afore all this noble barons: I wyll be sore punyshed. But by the fayth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat I owe to god, yf euer I finde me in any place where I maye help them: I shall helpe them with al my power, yf I should lose my heade for it. For all the world ought to hate me bycause I fayled theym at their need, for they ben my cosyns, and ye syr haue doone so muche to them that it shoulde suffise you, for they be not so muche gyltye of that they be char∣ged of, as men make semblaunt: but by the virgin Marye as longe as I shall lyue I shall not fayle theym of that I may doo, ouer hasti was Row¦land for to haue smitten me wrong∣full<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and without anye cause, but I will well that he knowe that yf he, sawe Reynawde mounted vpon his horse bayard: he should not take him for a rybawd, nor he should not dare abyde him bodye to bodye for all the golde of spayne. Whan Rowlande hearde Ogier speake thus: he sayd to him, by god Ogier ye haue praysed him muche, and ye make hym wun∣derfull hardye, but I praye god that I maye once fynde him vpon bayard h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s good horse all armed fro heade to toe, for to knowe yf he be so vali∣aunt as ye make him. Wit that god hearde the prayer of Rowlande, for Rowland not long after that: found Reynawde vpon bayarde, and I tell you that Rowlande helde hym not sith for no rybawd nor for knaue but tooke him for the best knyght of the worlde. ❧ But the history leueth nowe to tell of the kynge Charle∣mayne af Fraunce, of Rowland and of Ogyer the dane, and of the .xii. pe∣res of Fraunce that been at the siege afore Mountawban, and returneth to speake of Reinawde, that was yll at ease forthe loue of Richarde hys brother that was wounded to death in the roche Moūtbron.</P>
<P>NOw sheweth the history that after Reinawde had discom∣fyted the frenshemen: he returned a∣gain toward roche Montbron where he had left his brother Richard thus woūded as ye haue heard. And whā he was come there and sawe hys brother so horrible wounded: he could not keep hym from weping, and said Alas what shall I doo whan I haue lost my deare brother the best freend that I haue in the worlde? And after he had sayde that worde: he fel to the grounde from Bayarde in a swoun. And whan Alarde, and Guicharde, sawe theyr brother that was falle: they beganne to make theyr mone of Richarde pitteously. And whan Rei∣nawde was come agayne to himself: he made great sorowe with hys two brethren Alarde, and Guichard, vp∣on Richarde their brother that laye vpon the earthe with his bowelles betwene his handes. And this han∣gyng: came Mawgis vpon broykar∣re his good horse the best that menne wyste after bayarde, and held a peece of a spere in his hande. And whan he sawe Reinawde make suche a so∣rowe: he was right sorye for it. And whan he sawe Richarde thus sore wounded: he was wrothe and hadde great pytie for to see the wound that was so greate, for men saw the liuer within his body. Thenne sayd he to
<PB N="lxxix" REF="84"/> Reynawde, fayre Cosyn take heed what I shall saye and leaue this so∣rowe, ye knowe well that ye be all my cosyns and therfore we ought to perforce oure selfe for to socoure the one the other whan it is need. I ha∣ue socoured you manye tymes, and wit it that all the harme that Char∣lemaine bereth to me, it is al through your occasion, he slew my father but late, wherof I beare yet at my hert greate heauynes, that was your vn∣cle that died for your loue that know ye well. But yf ye wyll promise me afore all youre barons for to come wyth me into the tente of the kynge Charlemayne and helpe me to sawe hym for to auenge vpon hym the death of my saide father yf we can: I shall deliuer to you Richarde euyn now whole and sound wythout any sore. And whan Reynawde vnder∣stoode these wordes: he came vnto Mawgis, &amp; kissed him in the brest all weeping and said to hym. Righte sweet and fayre cosyn for god mercy Delyuer to me ayen my brother Ry∣chard whole yf it please you. And yf ye will that I doo any thyng for you: cōmaund me, and I shal doo it with right good hert. For ye wot wel that I dyd neuer any thyng that was a∣yenst your wyll, nor there is no man in the worlde, for whome I wolde, doo so much as I wolde doo for you. whan Mawgys sawe Reynawde weep so tenderly: he had greate pitie of it and sayde to him. Nowe be not dysmayed of no thyng fayre cosyne, for ye shall haue Rycharde whole and sounde incontynente. And than lyghted downe from his horse, and toke a bottell with white wine and washed y<SUP>e</SUP> wounde of Richarde ther∣withall ryghte well, and had away all the bloode that was about. And be not meruaylled where he gatte all suche thynges as apperteyned vnto this cute: For he was the subtelleste nygromancyer that euer was in the worlde. And whan he had doone soo: he toke his bowelles and put theym agayne in to his bodye, and than he toke a nedell and a threde, and sewed vp the wounde full maysterly &amp; hur∣ted not Rycharde, and after he tooke a salue. Whereof he anoynted all the wounde, and as soone as the wound was thus anoynted: it was as whol as thoughe he had neuer be hurte in that place of his body. And whan he had doone al this: he tooke a drinke &amp; gaue it to Richarde for to drynke. &amp; whan Richard had dronken it he ro∣se lyghtly vpon his feete al deliuered and quyte fro his disease, and sayde to his bretherne, where is Ogier go∣ne and his folke, are they scaped fro vs? brother answered Reynawde we haue dyscomfyted theym, God gra∣mercye and Mawgis that came for to succoure vs, for otherwyse we should haue ben al dead, &amp; so he hath saued vs and our lyues at thys tyme now ought we well to loue him more than our selfe, brother sayde Rychar∣de ye saye trouth, and after Alarde sayde to Mawgys, fayre cosyn heale me I pray you, for I haue a greate wounde in the thie. And I also sayd Reynawde for I am hurte right sore, and I also sayde Guychard, for god∣des loue gyue vs health vnto al vs, than sayde Mawgys vnto theym,
<PB REF="85"/> be not dismaied my fayre cosynes, for I shal helpe you all anone. Than tooke Mawgis of the white wyne, wherof he had washed the wounde of Richard, and washed their woun∣des of them all and after anoynted them sweetly and anon they were all whole. And whan they were al gar∣nyshed: they made Richarde to light vpon a horse, and put them self to the way for to returne againe to Moun∣tawban. And thus thei went on their waye: a spye departed fro the felow∣ship of Reinawd and came to Moū∣tawban, to the king yon and sayde to him. Sir I bringe you tydynges. Now wit that Reinawde and his brethren been scaped fro the plaine of Valcolours where that ye had sente them, and they haue dyscomfited O∣gyer the dane &amp; al the folke of Char∣lemaine, and also they haue slaine Foulques of Morillon and the earle Guimard, &amp; so many of other knigh∣tes that I cā not tel you the nombre.</P>
<P>ANd whan the king yon vnder∣stoode these tidinges: he was sore abashed of it that he wyst not what he should saye, and after he said. Alas how goeth this? here ben euil tydynges, how may this be? dyd they fynde the busshemente of the kynge Charlemayne? Syr sayde the spie, yea certaynly and shoulde haue been cursedly handled if their cosyne Mawgys had not socoured them, &amp; for y<SUP>e</SUP> socours that Maugis brought with him: Ogier was discomfited &amp; all his folke of Charlemaine, so that fewe of them scaped. For Mawgys brought to Reinawde Bayarde hys good horse, that was cause of all the harme that was doon there of the o∣ther parte. Alas vnhappy myschaūt said than the king yon and what shal I doo? if I abide Reinawd, Mawgis Alard, Guycharde and Richarde: I am deade without doubte, for all the worlde canne not defende me ther∣fro. And also it were well ryght, nor Reynawde should doo but well yf he slewe me cruelly. For I haue wel de∣serued death, for neuer Iudas ne the Emperour Neron of Rome made so great a treason as I haue doone that wolde haue brought to a cruel death the best knightes of the worlde, that been the foure sonnes of Aimon for the thretning of a prince. And whan he had said these wordes: he begā for to make great sorowe, and saide. Ha fayre sister Clare, this daye shall de∣parte our loue, ye shall neuer seme more. This day shal I forsake Gas∣coygne, for I shall neuer come again therin. And than he cried with an high voice. Now go hence faire lor∣des for goddes sake, be lyghtly ready For the need of it is nowe come, and lette vs goe bringe with vs the best knyghtes that I &amp; ye haue and if we may doo so much to get the woode of y<SUP>e</SUP> serpēt whiche is a great forest: we shal be safe ynough, &amp; we shal maye scape at our ease. For we shall lodge our self within an abbay of saint La¦zare, and we shal take such habyte as the monkes there haue. And by all thus shal we may be saued. For I know so much goodnes in Reinawd that whan he shall fynde vs shorne as Monkes: he shall doo vs no

This Pygwade had wel heard all that the kyng yon had sayd, &amp; wrote it in a skinne of Parche¦ment, and wente lightlye ought of Mountawban at the gate called the gate fawcon, and passed through the wood of the serpent in a litle while and met with Reynawde, his b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣thern &amp; Mawgis that came agayne to Moūtawban, that brought with them a great multitude of prysoners and Pigwade that great theefe wat¦ched vpon them. And anon he tanne as fast as he might to Moūtbendell and went into the pauilion of Char∣lemayne and called Rowlande and sayde to hym. Syr I shall tell you suche tydynges, wherby ye shall get good ynoughe, yf ye wyll beleue me, and I shall tell you a thyng wherof ye shalbe ryght glad. Good freende sayde than Rowlande, thou art wel∣com to me, &amp; what tidinges bringest thou tel me I praye thee? Syr sayde Pygwade, wyt it that the kyng Yon fleeth away all vnarmed, he and all hys folke and hath wyth theym no∣ther Somer nor Mule, but onlye theyr best horses, and they go into y<SUP>e</SUP> wood of the serpent into a house of religion, whiche is named saint La¦zare, &amp; he himselfe is delibered for to take the habite and to be come a mō∣ke. By my fayth sayd thā Rowlande I shal go meet with them anon with foure thousande knightes, and I shall auenge Reynawde &amp; hys bre∣therne vpon them, and I shal make them to be hanged as traytours.</P>
<P>For I neuer loued traytours nor ne∣uer shall and God wyll. Syr sayde pigwade yet is there more, for I haue found Reynawde, his brethern and Mawgys that came ouer the ryuer of balancon, that bringeth with thē many prysoners of your folke. And yf ye wyll fynde theym: ye muste go that waye. Freende sayd Rowlande ye haue deserued a great reward, for ye haue brought to vs good tydyn∣ges. Than Rowlande called to hym Olyuer, and sayd. Olyuer my good &amp; true felaw, lyght vpon your horse quickely, and bryng wyth you Gui∣dellon and Richarde of Normandy &amp; ye syr Ogyer of Denmarke ye shall come with me, if it please you, and ye shall see the great prowesse of Rey¦nawde the sonne of Aymon, and we shal take with vs but foure thousād men, and yet Reynawde is fiue thou¦sand well horsed and well arayed.</P>
<P>And thus we shal mowe fyght with them w<SUP>t</SUP>out any auauntage. Certes sayde Ogyer I shall goe there to see how ye shall haue hym. And whan ye haue taken hym: I promyse you to lend you a rope yf ye haue need of it. And whan they had al deuised thei mounted on horsebacke, and tooke theyr waye. And the greate ribawde guided them streight to the riuer of Balancon, and the king of Gascoin rode than through the woodes of y<SUP>e</SUP> serpent wyth his folke, and he rode so longe that he ariued at the mona∣stery of saint Lazare. And they prai∣ed the abbot of the place so muche y<SUP>t</SUP> he made them monkes in the deuils name. This hangynge: came there
<PB REF="86"/> Rowlande and Olyuer wyth theyr folke that entred anon into the ab∣bay. And whan the abbot saw them he came them agaynst, and all the co¦uent singyng Te deum laudamus.

But wyt that we seeke heere the falsest traytour of the worlde, y<SUP>t</SUP> men call the kynge Yon of Gascoyn the whych is heere within, for I wil hange hym lyke a theefe.</P>
<P>THan answered the abbot, ye shall not syr and please you, for he is become our monke, and al∣so he hath taken the habite, and ther∣fore wee shall defende hym agaynst all men. Whan Rowlande heard the abbot speake so: he tooke hym by the hood. And Olyuer tooke the priour that was nyghe and they shoued thē so pretely agaynst a piller of marble stone that theyr eyen lept out of their heads. And than Rowland sayd to y<SUP>e</SUP> abbot. Now mayster monke delyuer to me lyghtly that deuyl the king yon whyche is the brother of Iudas, or els I shall make an ende of you, for I haue sworne that he shal neuer doo treason more. Whā the abbot vnder∣stoode this that Rowlande sayde to him: he and all his monkes fled awai from him. And whan Rowland saw this: he set hande at his good swerde Durandall, and entred into the cloy∣stre, where he founde the kynge Yon kneeling before an Image of our la∣die, and was clad with the habite of religion, and the hode vpon his head And whan Rowlande sawe hym: he knew him well. For he had seen him with his vncle Charlemayne. Than he tooke him and sayde to hym, syr monke in the Deuils name conne ye well your lesson, aryse vp with soro∣we and come with me for to see the kyng Charlemayne. For he shal ma∣ke you to be hāged as a traytour pro¦ued euill king and a felon. Where bē the foure sonnes of Aymon that ye should haue delyuered vnto Char∣lemaine? ye shalbe paied for the trea∣son that ye haue doone, and I with mine handes shal auenge Reinawde and hys brethern vpon you, &amp; whan he had sayd this: he made the kynge Yon to be set vpon a horse, and blin∣ded his eyen wyth a cloute that he myght not see nothynge. And than gaue him the mokes hode vpon his head. And thus sat in the sadle the face towarde the horse tayle, and the backe forwarde. The king yon made none other thinge but that he wys∣shed styll after Reynawde and hys brethern and sayd. Alas and that I dyd great harme, whan that I consē∣ted to this mortall treason, nowe ought I well to dye ten tymes yf it might be so. For I haue wel deserued death. Whan the king yon had sayde this: he sayd to one of his priuy coū∣sell y<SUP>t</SUP> he herd nyghe him, how wel he saw not. Freend go to Mountawbā and tell Reynawde that he come to succoure me, for he is my man, and that he take no heede to mi trespace and euil dede, but to his fraunchise,

Syr sayde the knyght I shall not goe there, for I wot well that Reinawd wyll not set one foot out to saue you, bycause of the greate harme that ye wolde haue doon to hym, he shal sayd the kynge yon, for I knowe so much by hym that he shall not saie there a∣yenst. Syr I wyll than goe to hym with a good wyll syth that it please you, and god gyue that Reynawd his bretherne and Mawgys wyll come and helpe you, for I knowe wel that ye haue greate neede of it but yf god helpe you.

<P>IN this partye sheweth the hi∣story, that whan Reinawd and his brethern were wel whole of their woundes by the helpe of Mawgys that had healed them: they put theym selfe vnto the waye againe towarde Mountawbā. And whan they were come there: my ladye Clare went a∣yenst thē, and broughte with her two chyldren, yonnet and Aymonet, that had wept and scratched theyr sweet vysages so sore that there appeered of theym nother eyen nor mouthes, alwayes they wist not wherfore they dyd so, for they were verye yonge. And she also was all dysfygured for weepyng, and of great lamentacions that she made, for she wyst well how her brother the kynge yon had betrai∣ed Reynawde her housbond and his bretherne, and wende that they had been dead. But whan she sawe them come: she was neuer so gladde. And the two children ran at their fathers feete, &amp; wolde haue kyssed them. And whan Reinawd saw that: he shoued theym away with his feete so strōg∣lye that he had almoste broste theym. And the lady wolde haue taken him in her armes and kyssed hym: but he wold not suffre her, and fayde to her. Ladye goe oute of my syghte to your brother that fellon cruell and false traytoure, for ye shall neuer haue my loue again, for it hathe not holden in him, but that we shoulde haue be deade by thys tyme yf God and oure cosyn Mawgis had not succoured vs, nowe goe after hym all a foote and without companye, for ye shall not take nothynge of myne and as an euyll woman ye shall goe youre wayes for ye be the syster of the king yon, the greatest traytoure and the vntruest kinge of the worlde, and I shall angre your chyldren, for I feare
<PB N="lxxxii" REF="87"/> me lest they should be traytours as theyr vncle. Sir for god mercy sayd the ladi, I shal swere to you vpon al halowes that I had doubt of your goynge, and many times I dyd tell you of it, through the occasion of the dreme that I dremed that night, and I tolde you that ye should not beleue the king my brother. And not with∣standyng that he was my brother: I doubted this y<SUP>t</SUP> is be fallen syth. Sir for God I cry you mercy, for in this I am nothinge giltye, and so God haue mercy of my soule. For I loue moche better y<SUP>e</SUP> least toe of your foo∣te, than al king Yon my brother, nor all the lande of Gascoin. And whan she had sayd this: she fel downe in a swoune vpon the feete of Reynawd. And whā Guicharde saw the Ladye in a swoune: he tooke her vp &amp; sayde to her. Madame discomfort not your selfe so sort, let Reynawde saye hys wyll, for ye be our owne Lady and our syster, now be of good cheere, as long as we be aliue we shal not fayle you and thoughe our brother Rey∣nawde fayle you we shal not doo so, but we shall serue you wyth all our hert. Brother sayd Rycharde let vs doo one thyng, go we pray our bro∣ther Reynawde that he pardon my la¦dy our syster hys euyll wyll, for she is not gilty in the mater. And yf we wolde haue beleued her: wee should not haue gone one foote out of thys place, and now we ought to shewe the green and the russet Mantelles of ermynes the good horses and pal∣freys that mi lady did giue vs more oftener than did Reynawde, now let vs rewarde her for it for she hath mystre of it, and at y<SUP>e</SUP> ende: the freen∣de is knowen. By my fayth sayd A∣larde ye saye well. And than wente the three brethern vnto Reynawde and drewe hym a syde, and after A∣larde sayd to hym. Fayre brother for goddes loue be not thus angrye, for ye knowe y<SUP>t</SUP> my Lady hath no culpe at all the treason that her brother y<SUP>t</SUP> king yon hath doone to vs. For if ye wolde haue beleued her: wee should not haue gone thether. Wherfore we praye you that ye wyll pardon her.</P>
<P>Than sayd Reynawde, my brethern for the loue of you I graunt y<SUP>e</SUP> same and I pardon her myne euill wyll presently. Whan the brethern vnder∣stode him: they were ryght glad, and came to the Lady Clare, and sayd to her. Madame be of good cheere and make ioye, for we haue made youre peace. And than Alarde and Guy∣charde tooke her by the handes, and brought her to her husbād Reynawd &amp; whan Reynawde saw her: he went and tooke her by the chyn and kissed her. And than began the ioy and the feast ryght great at Mountawban. And they wasshed their handes and went to theyr meate. And thus as they sat at the table: there came in y<SUP>e</SUP> messanger of the king Yon, that cam to Reynawde, and whā he was afore Reynawde: he sayd to hym. Syr the kyng Yon sendeth you worde by me that ye com to succour him, for other wyse he cannot scape the death. For Rowlād and Olyuer ledeth him for to be hanged at Mountfawcon, and doo thys syr yf it please you for god and beholde not his euyll wyl, but take heed to your goodnes, for oure
<PB REF="88"/> Lorde pardonned Mary Magdalen and longis of their sinnes. He kno∣weth well y<SUP>t</SUP> he hath deserued death for the great faute that he hath doon to you, and yf ye slea him: he pardon∣neth to you his death.</P>
<P>GOddes curse haue he sayd A∣larde that shall set hys foote thitherwarde, nor that shal bye him agayne though he might be had for a strawe, but goddes curse haue Row∣land yf he hāgeth him not as a tray∣tour approued. whā Reynawde had heard this that the messanger sayd: he looked downwarde and studied a good whyle that he sayd no worde, &amp; whan he had thought long ynough: he begā to weepe beholding his bre∣therne, for a good herte can not lye whā it cometh to a need. Than sayd he a good reason as a noble knight. Lordes sayd Reynawde to hys bre∣thern &amp; to his knightes, Now heare what I wyll say to you. Ye knowe how I was disherited at paris wrō∣gefully vpon a feast of Penthecoste that Charlemaine helde open court and full in hys palays, where was a compani of great lordes. For there were .vii. hundred knyghtes all gen∣tilmen bothe of name and of armes and a hondred what of Dukes and of Erles, and more than foure score bysshopes, and many barons, &amp; that tyme was slayne the duke Benes of Aygremount myne vncle that was so good a knyght as men knew wel. I dyd aske right for him to Charle∣mayne afore all hys courte: wherof the kynge rebuked me and called me all to nought, and greate iniurye he sayd to me. And whan I sawe that y<SUP>e</SUP> kyng repreued me thus: I was wro∣the and right angry for it, &amp; I beheld vpon my brethern and knewe theyr stomackes, and saw myne enemyes before me, so neded not that I should haue sought them els where. And it suffised theym not of that I had be outraged by Charlemayne: but that Berthelot outraged me of newe, he and I playinge at the Chesse, wher∣of I tooke y<SUP>e</SUP> chesse boorde and smote hym with it so greate a stroke vpon hys head that I slew hym afore my feet. And Lewes a nother neuew of Charlemayne wolde haue slayne my brother Richarde and had hurte hym all redy full sore. But I smote hym in suche wise with my fyst y<SUP>t</SUP> I feld him downe dead afore me to therth, &amp; whan Charlemayne wyst of it: he wolde haue made me to be killed &amp; hewed into peeces, but my kynsemē wolde not suffre it, for there was great medlyng so that many strokes were gyuen. And whan the medling was ended: I mounted vpon Bay∣arde &amp; my brethern I made to moūt also thone before &amp; the two other be∣hynde me, and thus rode we al foure vpon my horse bayarde, &amp; so came to Ardeyne, where I dyd buylde a castell. And there Chaylemane ca∣me and beseeged me, and made swe∣re mi good father Aimon y<SUP>t</SUP> he shoul∣de neuer helpe vs wyth none of all his goods, and that he should be vt∣terly ayenste vs and in lyke wise he for closed me fro all my kynsmen y<SUP>t</SUP> none of them was not so hardy for to haue shewed to vs y<SUP>e</SUP> least fauour
<PB N="lxxxiii" REF="88"/> of y<SUP>e</SUP> worlde. Fayre bretherne ye kno¦we wel the great pouertie that we ha¦ue endured so longe time. And whan I sawe that I wyst not where to go I came into thys lande wyth suche a felawship as ye knowe, &amp; I spake to the kynge Yon and shewed hym howe I had warre agaynst Charle∣mayne, and he shewed me great loue and made me great honour so that he gaue me his syster to my wyfe, and with her a duchy, &amp; builded Moun∣tawbā for me. And of the other parte my chyldren are hys neuews, wher∣of thone beareth his name, y<SUP>t</SUP> is yon∣net, and ye see them here, and I haue saued hym hys Realme and all hys londe, and all his rebelles I haue made come to seeke mercy of hym, &amp; I foūd him neuer in faute, but Char¦lemayne is so great and so myghty a kynge, and also ye knowe well that he hath ouercome and dysshonoured many good mē, and for fere of him: the kyng Yon betrayed vs, wherof he is not to be blamed ouermuche, se¦ynge that agaynst Charlemayne no∣thinge hath power. And therfore yf the kynge Yon deliuered me to char∣lemayne: it was by euyll counsell y<SUP>t</SUP> some of hys barons gaue hym. For god made neuer so good a man, but that, that he misdoeth by euyll coun¦sell somtyme. And how can I leaue hym whan I haue not mystrusted hī afore time? me semeth that I ought to shew hym goodnes agaynst felo∣nye. Therfore I pray you all that ye wyll make you redy, for I wyll goe succour him. For it were great repro¦che to my chyldren that theyr vncle should be hanged as a theefe, and it were to vs a great disshonour, for he is our lord, and if he had doone euil: we ought to doo well agaynst it, and also we ought not to forget the bene¦faytes that the kynge yon hath doo∣ne to vs, and I promise you that the faute and the treason that he hath doone is not come through his ma∣lyce, but through euyll counsel. For yf it had be onlye by hys mocyon: I wolde see the hert from the bodye of hym, but I wot wel nay, for Char∣lemayne is of so great power that e∣uery man feareth him. And therfore I tell you that I wil goe rescue him from Rowlande if I can wyth all my power. By my fayth sayd Alard ye shall than goe wythout me, for I shal not put my feet there, for a tray∣tour ought neuer to be holpē nor suc¦coured. Nor I sayde Guycharde I shall not goe there. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e shal sayd Ri∣charde and it please you, syth y<SUP>t</SUP> Rey∣nawde wyll haue vs to doo so, for he is our Lorde and our welt, &amp; ther¦fore I pray you fayre bretherne that ye wyll obey him. Whan Reynawde had concluded that he should goe for to rescue the kynge Yon agaynst the wyll of Alarde and of Guicharde: al the Gascoynes that were there be∣gan to crye and sayde, blessed be the houre that euer Reynawde was borne. For no man erthely is wor∣the hym of goodnes and of prowes, and than they sayde to Reynawde, Syr we shall giue vp to you all the lande of Gascoyne, and shall make you the Lorde of it. For there shall be neuer none other lorde in Gascoy∣ne but you as longe as ye shall lyue so that for god ryght sweet syr that
<PB REF="89"/> ye suffre not the kynge yon to be had awaye to Charlemayne, for it were a great shame to all them of the rea∣me of Goscoyn that men had hanged theyr kyng. By mi soule sayd Reina∣wde ye say trouth. And than he tooke his horne and blewe it thre tymes so stronglye that he made all Moun∣tawban to sowne with it. And incō∣tynent without abydinge thei of the towne wente and armed them and came before Reinawde, and whā thei were all redy: Reynawde lighted v∣pon bayarde, the shelde at the necke and the spere in the hande, and they were well in hys felawship syx thou¦sande men on horsebacke, and well a thousande a foote. And whan thei were out of Mountawban: Reinawd spake to his folke and sayd to them, Lordes remēbre you that your lorde is in great daunger and in perill of death, and but if we fight strongli: he is dead without remedye, wherfore I pray you all that ye doo this daye that, that shall turne to our wor∣shyp. And whan Reynawde had said these wordes: he wente agayne to∣warde hys brethern and sayd to thē, Fayre brethern ye know that Row∣land hateth me to death &amp; not throu¦gh my defawte: but only through en¦uye. Wherfore I pray you that ye at∣tende vpon me thys day: and ye shal see me doo as a good knight, &amp; thys day the pryde of Rowlande must be leyde or els mine a downe. Whan A∣larde hearde his brother Reynawde speake so: he sayde to hym. And wher∣of care you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be sure and certayn that as longe that lyfe is in our bodyes: we shall not fayle you, and with this worde they put them to the waye.</P>
<P>And Reynawde tooke two thousand knyghtes and gaue them to Alarde and Guichard &amp; sayd to them. Fayre brethern ye shal make the forward &amp; keep your men in good ordenaūce, &amp; I &amp; my brother Richarde shal make the reregarde, syr sayde Alarde we shall doo it well yf god wyll, and thā they rode forthe so longe y<SUP>t</SUP> they sawe the folke of Rowland nygh them, &amp; whan Alarde a perceyued theym: he made hys mē to tary and sent worde to Reynawde that he shoulde make haste to come, for they had founde theyr enemies. And whan Reynawde wiste of these tidinges: he made hys folke to ryde hastely and came anon to Alarde his brother, and whan he saw his enemies: he put his folke in araye, &amp; deuised his batayles honest∣ly as a good capitayne of warre.</P>
<P>THan whan Rowland saw so great folke: he called to hym the bysshop Turpin &amp; Guydellon of bauyer &amp; sayd to thē. Lordes now be holde, I se yonder many folke armed might y<SUP>t</SUP> be Reynawde and his bre∣therne wherof the renome is so great and of theyr cosin Mawgys the sub∣till knyght? Syr sayde the Bysshop Turpyn, yea they bē tho verely, and also I tell you they make themselfe to be well knowe whersoeuer they goe and I tell you that wee cannot saue vs, but that we muste medle w<SUP>t</SUP> thē. Whan Ogier sawe Reynawde: he Ioyned &amp; heued his hādes towarde heauen and sayd. O god blessed thou be that haste suffred Rowlande to fynde Reynawde his bretherne and Mawgys, certes who that gaue me
<PB N="lxxxiv" REF="89"/> a thousande marke of golde I should not be so glad, for Rowlande hathe nowe all his besyre, and certayne I am ryght glad that we haue founde them. Nowe shall I see how he shal beare himselfe ayenst the valliaunte Reynawd his bretherne, and Maw∣gys, &amp; whan he had said this: he tur∣ned him selfe towarde Rowland and said to him. Rowland nowe haue ye that ye haue desired so longe, and I am glad that it is come so, for nowe shal I see how ye shal take thē. For it ye can take them a liue &amp; bryng thē to Charlemain: he shal con you great thanke for it, and so shall bayarde be your owne that ye haue so sore desi∣red, and the warre shall be thus finy∣shed. Ogyer Ogier saide than Row∣lande, these ven reproches that ye tel me. But by saynt Denys of fraunce ye shal see or euyn: who shal be mai∣ster of vs two. Rowland said Ogier, now shall it be seen what ye can doo. Whan Rowland knew that he muste haue medling with his enemyes: he ordeined all his battaile as he coulde wel doo, and after he set hys folke in ordenaunce of battaile the best that he myght. And whan Reynawde sawe that Rowlande ordeyned his battail∣les: he called his bretherne and sayde to thrm. Lordes heere come the fren∣shemen, yonder is Rowlande, Oly∣uer, and the Duke naymes of Baui∣ere, and Ogier the dane, ye shal abide heere for to make the rerega<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de and if we haue mystre of helpe: come and helpe vs. Syr sayd Mawgis ye ma∣ke to longe sermon, delyuer you for we tary to longe fro sawtynge vpon our enemies. Cosyn sayde Reynawd ye say wel, and ye speake lyke a good knyghte. For yet haue I not better knyghte than ye be one whan I see you armed bi me. Now thinke to doo well, for I goe fyrst of all for to ouer∣throwe the pryde of Rowland that is so greate as euerye man knoweth, &amp; I pray you al that euery man doo his parte with all his power.</P>
<P>ANd whan the brethern vnder∣stood that Reinawd wolde goe proue himselfe vpon Rowland: they began al three to weepe &amp; said. A bro∣ther, &amp; wil ye that ye and we be deade all at ones? For ye can slea your selfe no better than to proue your selfe vp∣on Rowlande: For he is ouermuche prue and vallyaunt, &amp; also he can not be hurte with yron, but we pray you that ye will assay your selfe vpon the other and let rowland alone. Lordes sayde Reynawde ye haue spoken ful wel, I know well that Rowlande is hardye &amp; prue, and that his matche is not in the world of knighthode, but I am in the ryght, &amp; he is in the wrong whiche shall nowe turne hym to a great harme, and therfore I wyll not refuse, but that I shal goe ayenst him but and if he will peace: he shall ha∣ue it, and if he wil haue warre, he shal fynde me redye to receyue hym ther∣to. For I haue leuer dye than be long sycke. ❧ Now I praye you speake no more of it, but see y<SUP>t</SUP> ye beare your selfe well ayenst our enemies, for we haue to doo ayenst many a noble kni∣ght. Cosin saide Mawgis thynke to assayle well. For ye shall be succou∣red ryght wel. Than the worthy and valliaunte knight Reynawde went
<PB REF="90"/> afore all the other with his sheeld at the necke, and his spere in his hande syttinge vpon baiarde. Whan row∣lande sawe reynawd come with his folke well ordred: he shewed it to O∣liuer and said. Felawe what thinke you by that folke? see how they come towarde vs in good araye. Certes rowlande sayde Olyuer, reynawde knoweth more of warre than any o∣ther knighte that liues, and the most gracious. For there is none so poore a knyght in the worlde if he come to him, but he shall be ryghte welcome to him, and yf he come a foote: he shal set him anon on horsebacke. And yf he be yll appointed: he shall anon a∣raye him after his estate. Is not this a great goodnes of him? ye be my sou∣le saide rowlande, and he dothe wel, For if he did otherwyse: he myghte not abide longe ayenst myne vncle Charlemayne. And me semeth sayde ayen Olyuer, that he hath well three tymes mo folke than we haue, wher∣of he myghte well get vpon vs, but yf we take better heede, for they been well subtyll folke. Olyuer sayd row∣lande ye saye trouthe, but ye knowe well the G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scoygnes ben cowardes of very kynde, and can not abyde no stroke of swerde, but that they wyll flee lyghtlye away, that is true sayde the byshop Turpyn, but they haue with theym a good guyde as any is in all the worlde. And wit it syr row∣lande, that the valyaunte man: cau∣seth his folke to abide nyghe hym. For a worthye capitaine is the myr∣rour &amp; ensaumple to the other for to doo well, whan rowland heard this. he wexed almost mad, bycause men praysed Reynawde and his folke so muche, and with this: he spurred his horse and went before all his folke well the shot of a bowe ferre, and ca∣me ayenst Reinawd. And whan Rei∣nawde sawe Rowland come alone: he saide to Alarde. Fayre brother be∣ware vpon as muche as ye loue me: that ye moue not, nor your folke, but abyde styl heere till that I haue Iou∣sted with Rowland that cometh alo∣ne, and therfore I wyl no man helpe me ayenst him. Whan Reinawd had sayd this: he spurred bayard with the spurres and came ayenst Rowlande so fast that they that saw it wend y<SUP>e</SUP> Baiard had floughe in the ayer. For the smallest lepe that he lept was of xxx. foot ferre or more. And whan he was come nigh Rowlande as for to haue Iousted: Reinawd lighted dow∣ne a foote, and pyght his spere in the erthe. And bound bayarde therat, by∣cause he should haue byde there styll. And vngyrte flamberge hys swerde and came before Rowland &amp; presen∣ted it to him &amp; kneeled afore him and kissed his foot, &amp; said al wepīg, damp Rowland I cry you mercy for the pi∣tie that our lord had on the crosse vp∣on his mother whan he cōmēded her to saynt Iohn that ye will haue pitie vpō me, ye know wel that I am your kinsman &amp; how be it I am poore: yet shal I be &amp; my brethern your mē. And also I shal giue you baiard &amp; shal ma¦ke you lorde of Mountawban, so y<SUP>t</SUP> it will please you to purchace our peace with the king Charlemaine your vn∣cle, and if it please you for to doo so: I shal make al my brethern to graunte the same, and I shal forsake fraunce
<PB N="lxxv" REF="90"/> al my lyfe. And I promise you that I shall goe into the holye lande wyth Mawgys and my bretherne, for to make warre agaynst the sarasyns, &amp; yf ye thinke that I say wel: bringe it aboute yf ye canne. For yf ye doo it: ye shall haue a felow and a seruaunt of me.</P>
<P>ROwland had great pitie whā he heard Reynawde speake in this maner, and began to weepe ful tenderly: and after sayd to hym. By god Reynawde I dare not speake of it, but if so be that ye wyll delyuer vnto him Mawgys. Alas sayd Rey∣nawde, I should neuer doo y<SUP>t</SUP> for to dye for it. For Mawgys is no man for to be giuē away for to haue peace And thā he rose vp &amp; toke his swerde and hys sheelde. And came to Bay∣arde and mounted vpon hym wyth∣out stirope, &amp; than he tooke his spere in his hand. And whan he was wel apparelled: he went agayne to Row∣land and sayd to him. Rowland wit that I shal neuer more cry you mer¦cy for fere that I haue of you, but I haue cry you mercy for to beare you worship bicause that ye be of my kin, but sith that I see y<SUP>t</SUP> ye be so proude that ye will doo nothyng for me nor for my prayer: I shall mowe deale resonably with you, to the ende that ye shall not mow reporte nor saye to the other Barons and knightes of Fraūce, that Reynawde the sonne of Aymon hath cried you mercy for fea¦re. The cause is suche, ye haue wyth you a great company of folke, and also I haue of my syde men ynough thanked be god, and if our folke assē∣ble together: it cannot be other wise, but that great harme shal fall of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the sides. But and ye will: we shall fyght we two together for them all without any help of other, and if ye ouercome me: ye shall bringe me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Charlemayne, y<SUP>t</SUP> shall doo hys plea∣sure of me, &amp; if I can conquere you ye shall come wyth me to Moūtaw∣ban vnder condition y<SUP>t</SUP> ye shall haue nother euyll nor shame, no more thā shall my owne person.</P>
<P>SHall ye doo this that ye haue sayde? sayd Rowlande: ye w<SUP>t</SUP>∣out faut sayd Reynawde. By my hed sayde Rowlande ye shall make me sure therof fyrste. Certes sayde Rey∣nawde wyth a good wyll. And thā Reynawde sware it vnto him vpon his parte of paradyse. Reynawde sayde Rowlande I wyl goe take leue of my felaw Oliuer, for I haue pro∣mised him that al the batayles y<SUP>t</SUP> I shall vndertake: he shal mow make them himselfe if it please him. Goe thā sayd Reynawde &amp; make it shorte. And than Rowlande wente agayne to hys felawes. And whan he was come to thē: Hector the sonne of Oc∣don, Oliuer and Ogyer the dane as∣ked of him sayinge. Sir Rowlande what saith Reynawde, haue ye spoke with him? yea sayd Rowlande, and what thinke you bi him. Certes said Rowland, Reynawde is a sage kni∣ght &amp; well taught, for he hath requy∣ted me to fyght with him bodye to bodye, and that our folke be styll of the one syde and of the other. Row∣land sayd Oliuer, ye shal doo in this your pleasure, for other yee or I must fight with him, but I counsell
<PB REF="91"/> that ye goe there, for as longe as I shall lyue I shal not be enemy to Rey¦nawde only for his worthynes. For Reynawde is a knight of great ho∣nour. Whan the bysshop Turpyn. Hector the sonne of Oedon and the other Erles hearde this: they began to say, Rowland what is that ye wil doo? For gods mercy doo it not, for Reynawde is of your lynage and of ours, and if ye bringe him to death: we shal neuer loue you after. Syr le∣ue that offre that Reynawde giueth to you and make your folke to assem¦ble with the folke of Reynawde, for it is better that they be take of youre folke, than that the one of you two were dead: wyll ye that it be so sayde Rowland? yea syr yf it please you.</P>
<P>Certes said Rowland it pleaseth me ryght well and than he sayd to al his folke, Lordes thinke to defende you well, for it is now need therof. Syr sayd the other haue no doubte of no∣thynge, for we shall doo wel your cō∣maundement, and than they put thē selfe in ordenaunce. And Rowlande began to crye mount ioye saynt De∣nys, and whan came to settinge on with speres: ye should haue seen thā many a knight brought to grounde &amp; manye horse that ranne maysterles thorough the feeldes so much that it was great pitie for to see so greate a destructiō of knightes as was made there. Whan Reynawde saw the two hostes muste assemble together: he spurred Bayarde with the spurres &amp; put himself amonge the thickest of y<SUP>e</SUP> Frenche men, and smote a knight so harde in the breste y<SUP>t</SUP> he ouerthrewe bothe horse and man to the grounde. and after smote another so sore that nether for sheelde nor for quyras of steele he let not but that he shoued the yren of his spere thorough and tho∣roughe his bodi, and fell dead to the erth, and wit at that stroke he brake his spere and Reynawde set hande lightly to his swerde, and began to crye Mountawban as lowde as he coulde. And than he made so greate slaughter of Frenchemen: that none durst abide afore hym, but fled from him as fro y<SUP>e</SUP> death. Shortli to speake Reynawd did so much thorough his strēgth, &amp; thorough the highe knight hode of his brethern: that he brake y<SUP>e</SUP> fyrste batayle of the Frenche men, wolde they or no.</P>

<P>WHan the litell Richarde, the brother of Reynawde saw y<SUP>t</SUP> the frenshemen were put a backe: He beganne to crie on heighte Ardeyne, as muche as he mighte, and put him selfe in to the greatest prese amonge hys enemies, and beganne to make so great hewing of folke that it was wunderfull to see. For Reinawde fought not, for to loke the better vp∣on him. And thenne Rycharde that thought hym selfe neuer wery of ge∣uyng of strokes: began to calle vpon his brother, and saide. Reynawde faire brother where ben youre greate strokes gone that ye were wunt for to gyue vpon youre enemyes. Alas smite now vpon them, for they been almost ouercome, make that the fren∣shemen full of pride mocke not with you, and so make we suche a thinge that it be spoken of it vnto Parys. Whan Reynawde hearde Rycharde speake thus: he beganne to smile, and after he smote bayard with the spur∣res &amp; began to smite better thenne he byd afore. Who that had seen than his greate strokes departe: he might wel haue said that no carpenter smot neuer so wel in wood: as Reynawd did vpō the helmes of steele, and vp∣on the sheeldes of the frensshemen. And whan the frensshmen saw that the discomfiture tourned vpon them: they began to call Rowlande, and sayd to him. Ha Rowland what doo ye? Why come ye not and helpe youre folke? For they bē dead, but if ye suc∣coure them. Whan Rowland vnder∣stood that word, wherof he was wro∣the, and right sory. And whā he saw his folke so sore handled: He began to cry Moūtioye saynt Denys. And after spurred his horse, and entred in to the medle. And went heere &amp; there crying Reinawde where be you gon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> see me heere I am all ready for to doo the battaile of my body ayenst yours that ye aske of me. Whan Reynawd hearde Rowlande that called thus after him He put flamberge into his sheth. And tooke a speare in his hād and came there as Rowland was &amp; said to him, where are ye Rowlande be ye a fearde of me that ye haue ta∣ried so longe? for beware youre selfe from me, and you of me saide Row∣lande. And thenne they spurred their horses and dyd Iouste the one ayeull the other. And whan the frensshmen and the Gascoignes sawe that: they withdrewe themselfe fro eche other, for to behold the Iousting of the two worthy knightes, for to say the trou∣the: there were not two other such in all the world.</P>
<P>ANd whan Salamon of Bre∣tayne, and Hector the sonne of Oedon saw that the Iousting of Reinawd and of Rowlande was be∣gon: they set themself to weep ful ten∣derly, &amp; came to the Duke Naimes, to the bysshop Turpyn and to Oly∣uer, and sayd to them, Howe lordes may ye suffre y<SUP>t</SUP> one of the best knigh∣tes of the worlde, and him that we ought to loue best be slayne and dead before you? Certes said y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Nay∣mes that shall be great sorowe to vs for to see. And than he came to Oli∣uer, &amp; saide to him. I praye you that ye goe to Rowland, and tel him from vs al, that he ought not to fight with
<PB REF="92"/> Reinawde with the swerde. But let him take a speare and breake it vpon Reinawde for to acquite his faythe. For yf he slea Reinawde: We shal ne∣uer loue him after. Lordes sayd then Ogier let them alone, ye knowe not Reynawde so well as I doo. Rey∣nawde is no childe to be made a ferd so lyghtlye as ye trowe. Lette theim shyfte hardely they two togither. For by the fayth that I owe to you, Row∣lande shall be all werye or euer he returne agayne. And he shall be as fayne to leaue the batayle as shall Reynawd. And ye shal see that Row¦land wolde he had not gone there for the best citie that themperoure Char∣lemaine hath. Ogier saide Ector ye speake of it as for enuye, certes yf he should fight with Rowland: ye should well saye otherwise. And than he saide to Olyuer. Good syr lette thys batayle be desterred yf ye may by a∣nye wise. Lordes saide Olyuer with a good wyll syth that ye will haue it so. And than he went to Rowlande &amp; sayd to him al that the barons hadde sayde. Felaw myn answered Row∣land, god confounde them, for they take away this day the desyre of my vncle Charlemain. And than he tur∣ned him toward Reynawd, and sayd to hym. Syr Reynawde ye haue as∣saied of my swerde: and not of my spote. Rowlande sayde Reynawde if ye haue youre swerde I shall conne you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o thanke nor gramercye for it. For I feare you not of nothyng, but l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e vs make an ende of our bataylle. And to whome god gyueth the victo∣rye: let him haue it. Rowland wolde not doo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but dyd lyke a curteous knighte, and he dyd as the barons had sente him worde. For he tooke a spere and ranne vpon Reinawde as much as he myght. And whan Rei∣naude sawe he wold none otherwise doo: he ranne also with a spere vpon Rowlande, and rought eche other so wonderful hard that they made theyr speres to flee all in peeces, and whan they had broken their speres: they re∣countred eche other with theyr sheel∣des so stronglye that both theyr hor∣ses, that is to wit Bayard and Me∣lantes stakered, and were all astoni∣ed therwithal. But with that stroke Rowland and Melantes were both felled to the grounde on a heape, and Reinawd passed forth by thē cryinge with an high voyce Mountawban. Wherby I tell you for certayne that Rowlande neuer felle downe for no stroke of spere: but onely that tyme. but it was no meruaile. For he could not holde hym selfe by the cloudes whan his horse had failled hym.</P>
<P>THan whan Rowlande sawe hymselfe thus ouerthrowen: he was not wel contente and rose in continente and toke his swerd in hys hand, and came to Melantes for to cutte of his head, and began to say euyll courser who keepeth me that I kille the not? not sith that thou hast let falle thy selfe throughe the stroke of a childe, I shall neuer trust thee. So helpe me god Rowlande sayde Reynawd ye doo to Melantes great wronge. For it is longe sith that he eat any meat, and therfore he can not trauayll lyke bayarde for he is more
<PB N="lxxxvii" REF="92"/> strong than is your horse, and than Reynawde lyghted downe fro bay∣ard by cause that Rowlande was a foote. And whan bayarde sawe hys maister a foote: he ran vpon Melan∣tis the horse of Rowland &amp; smot him with his hinder feet so great strokes that he hadde almost broken his thy, whan Rowlande sawe: that he was wrothe for it and came towarde bay∣arde, for to haue smyte of hys heade. And whan Reinawde sawe that: he sayd to Rowland. What wyl ye doo? it is no worshyppe to you to smyte a beast, and yf ye wyl doo any fayte of armes: come to me &amp; not to my horse for I shall gyue you strokes ynou∣ghe so muche that ye shall be wery of it or we departe, but keep wel that I slea not you &amp; leue Bayard in peace. For there is not in all the worlde an other so good a beast. For he did shew it well whan he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oan the crowne of Charlemayne your vncle in youre presence, and yf he doth helpe me: he both but his deuoyre that a good hor∣se ought to doo, but turne your sheeld towarde me and ye shall see howe Flamberge cutteth. Reynawde Rei∣nawde sayd Rowlande, threten not so much. For before thys day be com at an ende: ye shall see a thynge that shall not please you ouer much.</P>
<P>REynawde was not contente whan he vnderstoode the ylle wordes of Rowlande, and shooke al for angre, and incontinent ranne vp on Rowlande and gaue him suche a stroke vpon his helme: that he all to brused it, and the stroke slided vpon the sheelde so that he cut of it a great quarter, and of the courset of steele al∣so, but he cut nothinge of the fleshe. And whan Reynawde hadde gyuen Rowlande that stroke: he sayde in maner of a mocke to Rowlande, what saye ye by my swerde, doo it cut well or no? for I haue not missed at that stroke, now keep you well fro me, for I am not suche a childe as ye take me for. Whan Rowlande felte that great stroke that Reinawde had gyuen to hym: he was all meruayl∣led of it, and withdrewe hymselfe a backe for he wold not that Reynawd should haue recouered a nother stroke vpon hym sodenly, and sette hande to Durandall his good swerde and ranne vpon Reinawde, and Rey∣nawd helde his sheelde ayenst it. and Rowlande smot in to the sheelde so great a stroke y<SUP>t</SUP> he cloue it by the mid¦des through and through, &amp; the stroke descended vpon the helme and dyd it no harme. And whan Rowland had made that stroke: he said to Reinawd Vassail ye be now quite. for I haue yelded you againe that ye lended me ryghte nowe. Nowe shall I see who shall begynne agayne. By my soule sayd Reinawde fowle fall haue I now yf I feyne me nowe. For I dyd but playe afore, nor your fraunchyse shal neuer auaylle you ayenst me but that I shall brynge youre pryde all downe to the erthe. Reynawde said Rowland yf ye doo this that ye say: ye shall werke merueilles. And all thus as they wold haue begon again the bataylle: so came there Mawgis &amp; al his company, &amp; said to Reinawd Cosyn mounte vpon bayarde, for it were to great a losse yf you or Row∣lande
<PB REF="93"/> were deade, &amp; there came Ogi∣er &amp; Olyuer and made Rowland to light agayne vpon his horse. But wit it well that Ogyer had not be so gladde yf one had giue to him a great cytie: as he was be cause that Rey∣nawde had cast downe Rowland &amp; his horse. And whan they had recoū∣tred Rowland: they began a sore ba∣tayle and a cruell, and so fell that it was pytie for to see, for the one hewe the other without anye mercye. And whan Rowland sawe that the batail was begon, again his hert dyd swell for angre by cause that Reinawde bad ouerthrowen him to the ground, so beganne he to cal as hyghe as he myght. Where are ye gone Reynaw∣de the sonne of Aymon, goe a side and lette vs parfornyshe our batayl for men knowe not yet whiche is the best knyghte of vs two. Syr sayde Reynawde ye haue the courage of a knyght that wyll conquere honour, but and we fyght heere togyther our folke shall not suffre it. But lette vs doo one thyng that I shall tell you. ye be well horsed and I am also, let vs bothe swyme ouer the ryuer and goe to the wood of serpente. For ye canne not wyshe no better place for to fyght, and we shal not be there de∣parted thone fro the other of our fol∣ke, but w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall maye fyght there to∣gyther tyll the one of vs two be dis∣comfited &amp; ouercome. Certes sayde Rowlande ye haue well spoken and I graunt it as ye haue said, and thā they spurrrd their horses for to goe to the wood of the serpent, but Olyuer tooke heed to them, &amp; tooke Rowlād by the brydell, and withhelde hym wolde he or no, and Reinawde went for to haue passed ouer the ryuer vp∣on bayarde that ran as the winde, and walloped so harde that he made al the erthe where he passed to shake vnder him, &amp; as he rā in this maner: he looked afore him &amp; saw the king yon that was auyronned with well foure score knightes that keept hym for feare of Reinawd, lest he and his bretherne shoulde haue rescued hym, these knyghtes ledde him shameful∣lie as ye haue hearde afore. And whā Reynawde sawe the kyng: he was gladde of it and sayd. Ha good lorde blessed be thy name, whan ye haue graunted me so fayre aduenture, and with this: he set hande to hys swerd and spu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red bayard with the spurres and cried as highe as he could, lette goe the kyng yon euell folke that ye be. For ye be not worthy to ley hande vpon him. And than he entred wyth in them and smot a knight vpon his helme so rudely that he cloue his head to the harde teeth, and ouerthrewe him dead to the earth. And whan the other sawe Reynawd amonge them: they put themselfe to flyght, and said the one to the other. The deuyll hath brought this cruell man heere nowe, lette vs flee, goddes curse haue he y<SUP>t</SUP> shall abide him, for the soule of hym that wilfully suffreth him selfe to be slaine: shall neuer come to the mercye of god. And than they put themselfe into the thyckest of the forest, and lefte behynde theym the kynge yon that they lodged as a prysoner. And Reynawd came streyght to hym and vnbounde hym and vnstopped hys eyen, and after sayde to hym
<PB N="lxxxviii" REF="93"/> Ha euell kynge, how haue ye the hert for to betray vs so falslye as ye haue doone me and my brethern? dyd we euer any thing that was in your dis∣pleasure? It is not longe on you, but that we should haue been all hanged by this, but I shal smite of your head euen anon, and shall auenge me and my bretherne vpon your body. Whā the kynge yon sawe Reynawde that hadde delyuered hym: he kneeled a downe before hym and sayde to him. Certes noble knyghte it is well rea∣son that men slea me. Wherof I pray you for god that your selfe will take the lyfe fro me, and cut of my heade, and lette it be doone by none other, and pulle out my tonge wherwyth I spake that treason. For I haue well deserued greater martyrdom, and all this made me doo the erle of Ansom, and the erle Anthony. Now slea me for god, for such an euil man as I am oughte not to liue longe. I haue much leuer that ye kill me with your swerde than that cruell kynge Charlemayne should make me to be hanged. Now lyghte vp sayde Rey∣nawde, for ye shall be well payed as ye haue deserued. ❧ But heere leaue I to speake of the kyng yon of Gas∣coyne and of Reinawde that been in the wood of the serpente, where that he taryed after Rowland for to fight with him, as he had promysed vnto hym: and shal retourne for to speake of Rowland and of Oliuer that spa∣ke vnto their folke for to tell theym a parte of their besines, &amp; howe they had be dyscomfyted.</P>
<P>IN this parte sheweth the his∣tory that after Reinawd was departed from the bataylle for to goe fight body to body ayenst Rowlande the neuewe of the king Charlemati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the wood of the serpente: Row∣land, Olyuer and Ogier the Dane, fought ayenst Alarde, Guycharde, and the litell Rychard, ayenst Maw∣gys and ayenst theyr folke, and the batayle was there so sharpe and so fell of one parte and of the other, so that greate hurte and scathe was there made of both partes, but at the laste the dyscomfyture turned vpon Rowlande, and vpon his folke. In so muche that Rowlande and Oly∣uer were constrayned by force for to goe backe againe all dyscomfyted, for the three bretherne and Mawgis made ayenst them so greate efforte of armes that they gate the pryce that daye. And thus as Rowlande wen∣te backe againe all dyscomfyted: he bare his head low, for he was a sha∣med that he had be so rebuked. And than Ogier saide to him, Lord Row∣lande who hath a rayed your sheelde of this facion? I see your horse hur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in the thyghe and vnder the croper, he was felled vpon the righte syde &amp; you also, it is wel seen on your syde, I trowe that ye haue founde Rey∣nawde the sonne of Aymon, haue ye brought him with you? Where haue ye put him? Whan Rowland vnder∣stood the reproche that Ogyer made vnto him: he wexed almost madde for angre. So tooke he hys swerde and ranne vpon Ogier for to haue smiten him vpon the head. But whā that Oliuer saw this: he tooke Row∣land by the bridell, and the erle Gui∣dellon tooke Ogyer, and thus they
<PB REF="94"/> were departed, and thus as they were departed, &amp; that Rowland went on his waye, came there after hym the litell Richard the brother of Rei∣nawde, that began to calle as hie as he might damp Rowlande ye goe to¦wardely awaye, returne agayne that I may see your sheelde, and lette vs haue a course we two togyther. Kni∣ght answered Rowland. I graunte therto by my faith. And than they spurred their horses with their spur∣res, and Rowland came ayenst Ry∣charde so harde that he ouerthrewe hym and his horse with all in a hepe to the grounde. And whan Richard sawe himselfe thus a grounde: he ro∣se vp quickely and came to his horse and lighted vp againe without anye styrop. And whan he was on horse backe he set hande on his swerd and defended him selfe nobly against hys enemy Rowland.</P>
<P>WHan Rowlande saw thys, and that he knewe that it was one of the bretherne of Reynawde: he had so great ioye of it that him se∣med that he had been in Paradyse, and incontinente he beganne to crye Mountioyc saynt Denys. And said, vpon him nowe my frendes, for yf he scape vs: I shall tell it to the king Charlemayne. And whan that the frenshemen saw that Rowland wol∣de haue taken Richard: they sette al, vpon him, so that they smote hym wyth more then foure swerdes al at once, and it happed so that his horse was kylled vnder hym, and he ouer∣throwen to the erthe. And whan that Richard saw his horse dead a groūd: he was ryght sory for it, and rose vp quickelye vpon his feete, and smote the erle Anthony so greate a stroke with his swerd that he wounded him ryght sore. Humall the breton sawe that: &amp; he smot Richard, and Richard recouered vpō him with such a stro∣ke that he felled both horse and man to the erthe. And with this: Guidellō came from behynde and ouerthrewe Richarde fro the arsons of hys sadle to the grounde. And whan Rowland saw Richard at the ground: he came to hym and sayde. Nowe yeeld you and abyde not that we slea you, for it were great domage, syr sayd than Richard the yongest sonne of Aimon to you Rowlande I shall yeeld me &amp; to none other. For I cā not yeeld me to no better man than ye be one. And with this he tooke him his swerde, &amp; Rowlande receyued it with a good wyll and made the lytell Rycharde to light vpon a mule. And thus they hadde hym prysoner. Alas and what a domage shall it be yf the prue Ry∣charde be hanged? he is well lyke to be, but that god &amp; Mawgys delyuer hym, all this myshappe sawe a ser∣uaunte of Richarde. And whan he saw that men ledde thus his maister Richard: he spurred hys horse with the spurres and auentured him selfe to passe ouer the riuer, and came ligh¦telye to Reinawde and saide to hym. Syr I bringe you euell tydynges wyt that Rowlande leadeth wyth hym your brother Rycharde for pry∣soner well shamefully. Whan Rey∣nawde vnderstoode these wordes: he was sore angry for it, that he had al∣moste lost his wytte, and after he
<PB N="lxxxix" REF="94"/> sayde to the yemon, come hither tell me my freend, are they that leden my brother terre hence? Syr sayd the ye∣man, yea, it is not possyble that ye shoulde ouertake theim. And whan Reynawde vnderstood this: he was more angry than he was tofore, and fell from bayarde in a swoune to the erthe. And whan he was come again to him selfe: he behelde afore hym. And sawe his broher Alarde come with his folke that came after Rey∣nawde by the trase. For they wende that Richarde hadde be gone to hym longe afore them. And whan Alarde sawe Reynawd make such a sorow: he came than to hym and sayde in thys maner. Ha fayre brother, and what eyleth you? It longeth nor to such a knight as ye be for to make so great a sorow as ye doo. Alard sayd Reinawd, ye haue doone ful yl, for I haue left my brother Richarde with you to keep hym, and ye haue lost him, for Rowland ledeth him with hym as prisoner, and he is all ready so ferre brought that we can nor suc∣cour hym, whan Alard, &amp; Guichard vnderstoode these tydynges: they beganne to make suche a sorow that it was meruaile for to see the lamen∣tacion that thei made, alas sayd Rei∣nawde, what is he that hath parted our company? to day in the morning we were foure bretherne togyther &amp; nowe we been but three. Ha fayre brother Richard it is greate domage of you, for if ye had liued your age: ye should haue passed all your brethern seyng that ye were the yongest of vs all and yet ye were the most hardye, and throughe your hardynes: ye are taken, fayre brother sayd Alarde, all cometh by you that brought vs heere ayenst our wyl for to succour the kīg yon. Now haue we loste Rycharde, wherof the losse shall neuer be reco∣uered, for we shall neuer see hym a lyue. And whan he had sayd thys: he sayd to Guycharde. Brother drawe out your swerde so shall we cut of the head of thys traytoure kinge yon therwith, for whome we haue nowe lost our brother Richarde, brother saide than Reynawde. I praye you for the lou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that ye haue to me that ye touche not the kinge yon for to doo hym anye harme, for he hathe yelded hymselfe vnto me, but brynge hym vnto Mountawban, and see that he be kept sure. And I shall abyde heere wyth my good horse Bayarde and flamberge my good swerde wythout any other company. So shall I goe in to the pauylion of Charlemayne, where I shal recouer my brother Ri∣chard or a nother prysoner for hym: or elles I shall die with him. And whan he had said that word: he spur∣red bayarde with the spurres for to haue gone thyther: but Alarde tooke him by the brydell and Guycharde tooke him with both his armes fro behind for to keep him that he should not goe, and than Alard said to him, by saynt Peter of rome ye shall not goe no foot there, for it is better that Rycharde: dye yf it must be sothan ye should dye. And thus as the three bretherne made theyr mone for Ry∣charde, came there Mawgys theyr cosin y<SUP>t</SUP> folowed them, &amp; when he saw his cosins make such sorow: he was sore a gast and said to them. Wha
<PB REF="95"/> eyleth you fayre cosins? it is no wor∣shippe nor the maner of good knigh∣tes, but of wymen to make such so∣row as ye doo. Cosyn cosyn sayd A∣lard, I shal tel you what causeth vs to doo so. Wit that Rowland leadeth Rycharde for hys prysoner the best knight of the world afte Reinawd, and Reinawde wyll goe to the Paui∣lyon of Charlemayne, and also ye knowe well yf he goe there: he is but lost for euermore. Reynawd (said thē Mawgis) it were no wysdome to you yf ye went there, for your going thyther should not proffyte you no∣thynge, but goe youre wayes to Mountawban, and I shall goe there as ye wold haue gon my selfe, and yf Richard be not dead: I shall brynge him again with me vnto you al were he shytte vp in .x. prysones mawgre Charlemayn. Cosyn said Reynawd, I shall become your man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e yf ye doo thys that ye saye. Cosyn sayde Mawgis I shal doo it without faut, but leue youre sorowe I shal delyuer him ayen to your hādes whole &amp; soū∣de yf it please god: and whan he had sayde so: the brethern sette themselfe to the waye for to returne to Moun∣tawbā, but so great sorow was there neuer made as the three bretherne made for their brother Richarde, &amp; thus making their great mone: thei dyd so muche that they came vnto Mountawban and lyghted fro their horses in the base courte, &amp; after wēt vp to the dungeon &amp; whan the noble lady Clare, y<SUP>e</SUP> wife of Reinawd wist that her husbande came: she came a¦gaynst hym right glad and Ioyfull and led at eche hande of her bothe her yonge chyldren. Aimon and yon, and eyther of theym bare a lytell staffe in theyr handes, and began to crye vp∣on theyr vncle, vassaile, but that ye be now prysoner: ye should haue di∣ed by our handes, &amp; they came nyghe hym and saide cursed kinge and vn∣true why haue you betrayed my lord our father and his bretherne our vn∣cles that haue doone to you so good seruyse? sertes ye be well worthye to dye a shamefull death. Whan Alarde hearde his neuewes speake of thys maner: he began to weep ful tender∣ly. And thus as he wept he kissed Ai∣monet that bare the name of theyr father, and said. Ha god how ben we brought lowe and destroyed. And whan that y<SUP>e</SUP> lady heard Alard speak these wordes, and saw that he wept: she thoughte well that it was not without a cause, and she sayde to A∣larde. Fayre brother for god tell me the occasion of youre sorowe. Ladye sayd Alarde with a good wyl. Now wyt that we haue loste oure brother Richarde. Rowlande ledeth hym for hys prisoner to Charlemaine, but yf our lord saue him: We are not lyke ne∣uer to see him. Alas I vnhappy what shall we doo sayd the lady, syth that Rychard is lost? For we shall neuer haue honoure. And sayinge these wordes: she fell downe in a swoune to the erth.

<P>NOw telleth the historye, that whan Mawgys was come againe to Mountawban: he was so much wrothe that he myght no more for y<SUP>e</SUP> loue of Richard that was take. And because that Reinawde and his bretherne made therfore so great so∣rowe. Incontinente that he was lyghted from hys horse, he went in to his chambre and made hym selfe to be disarmed and after he tooke of all his clothes, and put him selfe all naked, and this doone: he tooke an herbe and eate it, &amp; as soone that he had it: he swelled like a padde, and than he tooke an other herbe, &amp; chau∣fed it and helde it betwene hys teeth, and anon he became al blacke as a cole in his face os one that is beaten with staues, &amp; his eyen reeled in hys
<PB REF="96"/> head as he hadde be other dronke or mad, and disguysed himselfe won∣derfully, that he that had well know him afore, shoulde not than haue said that he hadde be Mawgys. And whan he was thus turned and coun∣trefayt: he tooke a great mantell and a hoode &amp; clothed himselfe therwith and tooke on his feet a greate payre of bootes and the staffe of a pilgrime in his hande. And thus arayed: he is∣sued out of Mountawban. And whā he was out: he set himselfe for to goe the way so greate pase that no horse could not haue waloped so fast, tyll that he came to mountbendel, before the centes of the emperour Charle∣mayne or euer that Rowlande were come there againe, and there he helde him stil and spake nothing at all, but looked onely vpon the kyng and vpō his pauyllion. And whā he went: he halted with the one foote, &amp; lened be∣fore the kinges tent vpon his staffe, and kepte the one of his eyen close.</P>
<P>And whā he saw the kyng come oute of his pauyllion: he nighed him and said God of heauen that suffred deth and passion on the crosse, keep you kyng Charlemain fro deth and from prison, and from euil treason.</P>
<P>VAssail said the kinge Char∣lemayn god confounde you for I shall neuer truste vpon suche a begger as ye be, bycause of the euyll theef Mawgis, the whiche hath de∣ceyued me many times, for whan he wil, he is a palmer a knight or a gri∣fon or elles a heremyte, by suche ma∣ner that I canne not beware of hym And if it please god &amp; his blessed mo¦ther I shal auenge me once vpon him howe that the game goeth. And whā Mawgys hearde the Emperoure speake of this maner: he answered nothynge, and kepte hym styl a great whyle, and after he sayd to the king. Syr yf Mawgys be a theefe all o∣ther poore folke be not so. I haue more need of helthe, than I haue to doo any treason, and it is well seen on me that I am not the bodye that might doo any great harme. Syr I come from Iherusalē, where I haue worshypped the holy graue, and ha∣ue doone my oblacions in the temple of Salomon, and yet I must goe to rome and to saint Iames in galyce &amp; God will. But I dyd passe yester∣daye ouer balancon and ouer Giron∣de, with .x. men my seruauntes that I ledde alwaies by the waye with me for to keep &amp; defende my bodye. And whan I had passed ouer Gyronde: I came with my men throughe a wood nighe Mountawban, where I met with many brygantes and theues y<SUP>e</SUP> slewe all my men and all that I had they took fro me, and let me goe, and gladde I was whan so fayre I was deliuered of theim. And after I as∣ked of the folke of the countrey what menne they were that so hadde slaine my men, and they dyd tell me that they were the foure sonnes of Aymō and a greate theefe that was called Mawgis with theym. And I asked them why they wold set themselfe to so foule a craft &amp; vnhappy, seen that they were so greate gentilmen born? and the people of the coūtrey answer∣de me that they were constrained for
<PB N="xci" REF="96"/> to doo so bycause they had so greate pouertie within Mountawban that they wist nor what to doo. But I did neuer see so cruel a man as the same Mawgys is, for he bounde my han∣des behinde my backe whan he had robbed me, and thā he bet me so sore: that I weened to haue dyed therof, and hath araied me as ye see. Syr ye be the best kynge in the worlde and ye be the lorde of all this land, wher∣fore I pray you for god that ye wyl doo me ryght of these four sonnes of Aymon and of Mawgis that greate theefe. And whan Charlemain vn∣derstood these wordes: he ryghted his heade vp, &amp; said. Pylgryme is it true as thou saiest? yea sir said Mawgis. Nowe tell me thy name said Char∣lemayne. Sir said Mawgys, my na∣me is Gaidon, &amp; I am borne in Bre∣tayne &amp; I am a great man in my con∣trey, wherfore I require you in the worshyppe of the holye sepulcre that I haue sought: that ye doo me ryght. Pylgrime sayde Charlemaine I can not haue no ryght of them my selfe, for I promyse thee if I had them: all the worlde should not saue them, but that I shoulde make them dye a sha∣meful deathe. Syr sayde then Maw∣gys, sith that ye can do me no ryghte of theym: I beseche almightye god that is in heuen that it pleaseth him for to doo it. Syr saide the barons thys pilgrime semeth to be a good man and a true as we suppose. For it is well seen on him, geue to hym your almesse yf it please you. And thenne the kinge commaunded that men should giue him twentye pound of money, and Mawgis tooke them and put it in his hoode, and he saide in himselfe, ye haue gyuen to me of your own good but ye haue doon like a foole. I shal rewarde you ryght e∣uel for it or euer I departe fro you, &amp; whan he had the syluer: he asked for some meate for gods sake, and oure ladyes, for sythe yesterdaye he hadde not eaten as he said, by my faith said Charlemaine thou shalt haue meat &amp; drinke ynoughe. And anon they did brynge him meate, and he sette him downe and tooke and eate wel of the best. And the king saide to him nowe eat free good pilgrim. For thou shalt be wel serued, and Mawgys eat styl &amp; answered neuer a word but beheld onely the king in hys vysage. And the kinge saide to him tell me Pyl∣gryme and hide no thynge from me, whi hast thou loked so on me? sir said Mawgis I shall tel you with a good wyll. Wyt that I am a wel trauayl∣led man, but in no place that euer I was, I saw neyther christen man ne sarasyn so goodly a prince, ne so cur∣teous as ye be one, wherof of all the pardones that I haue wonne in my vyage makinge. I giue you the haue freely. Certes pilgrime said the king and I take it gladlye. And I thanke you muche therof. And Mawgys gaue hym for a witnesse of the same his palmers staffe for to kysse it, thā said the barons euery chone certain∣lye syr the pylgryme hath giuen vn∣to you a verye fayre gyfte, ye oughte to rewarde him wel for it. Syr said thenne Mawgis I aske none other rewarde of you for it but that it plea∣se you for to take my poore gyfte a worthe, and that I may rest my selfe
<PB REF="97"/> heere a while for I am verye sycke &amp; wery. And thus as the kynge spake to Mawgys: came than Rowlande and Oliuer. and al their folke, that brought Richard for a prisoner.</P>
<P>ANd whan Ogier &amp; Estorfawd the sonne of Oedon, and the duke Naimes saw that Row∣land wold goe to the pauiliō of char∣lemaine with Richard: They came to Rowlande and saide to him. Syr Rowland howe can ye hate Richard so sore that ye wyll yeeld hym to Charlemaine? Lordes said Rowlād what wyll ye that I shall doo wyth him: tell me and I shall doo it. Syr sayde they we wyll that ye delyuer Richard and ye shall say that it was a no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her prisoner. Lordes sayd Row¦lande yf I canne doo this: I shal doo it gladly. And these wordes hearde a yoman, that incontinent spurred his horse, and came to the kinges tent, &amp; said to Charlemayne. Syr I bringe you tydynges sore straunge, we haue foughten by the ryuer syde of Balancon, where that Reinawd the sonne of Aymon hath keept his own right well ayenst Rowland your ne∣uew, and setteth not a straw by him. And Rowland lost there more than he wan. Whan the Emperoure char∣lemayne vnderstood that worde: he was abasshed greatlye, and after he said to the yoman. Tel me my freend howe was yet of my neuewe Row∣land? Sir said the yoman, he fought with the foure sonnes of Aimon, that defended themselfe well. But Row∣lande hath brought with him pryso∣ner one of the foure sonnes of Aimō the which is the most hardy and the most valiaunt of thē al in al pointes.</P>
<P>CHarlemayn began than to lepe for Ioye whan he vnderstoode these tydynges, and came out of his tent, and behelde and sawe Rychard that Rowlande broughte, and whan Charlemayne sawe Richarde: he knewe him well incontinente, and began to crie for greate Ioye that he had. By my soule neuewe it is well seen that ye haue ben there. For elles Richarde shoulde not haue ben take. Certes sir said Rowlande, well lied Ogierro you, for yf he hadde not be: the foure sonnes of Aimon were take aswell as one, and than said the king to Rychard. Whoresone by the faith that I owe to god, ye shal be hanged by the necke, but fyrst ye shall haue of euil and of tormentes ynoughe sir said Richard I am in pryson. I feare me not to be hanged as longe as my brother shal may lyght vpon bayard and that Mawgys be alyue, Alarde, and Guicharde my ryghte deare bre∣thern, for if ye do to me any outrage: no castell, ne town, ne fortresse shal not keep you, but they shal make you dye an euell deathe or two dayes be passed. Whan Charlemayne heard Richard speake so proudlye: he was ryghte an angred for it, and tooke a staffe with bothe hys handes and smote Richard therwith vpon hys heade so hard that he made the bloud renne out of it to the earthe, and whā Richarde felte himselfe thus woun∣ded: he vaunced him selfe, and tooke themperour Charlemain with both the
<PB N="xcii" REF="97"/> hys armes by the waste &amp; wrastled to¦gither a longe whyle, so that they fell both downe the one heere, &amp; the other there. And Rycharde rose vp quicke∣ly and wolde haue renne vpon Char∣lemayne but Ogyer, and Salamon seassed him and kept him therfro, and after they sayd to Charlemayne. Syr ye haue doone ouermuche amys, for to beate a prysoner. Certes my lordes saide Richarde it is more dyshonoure to the kynge to smite me, than it is to me for to defende my bodye, but he is well wunt to doo suche outrages, for it is not the fyrste that he hathe doone, nor it shall not be the last. And whan Mawgis sawe that Charle∣mayn had smytten Rychard: he was sore an angred therfore, that he had al∣most layed vpon him wyth his pal∣mers staffe, but he thought yf he had doo so: bothe Richarde and he shoulde haue be dead. And whan Charlemai∣ne sawe that Richarde spake so bold∣ly: he sayde to hym. Rycharde God confounde me, yf ye scape me for all your wickednes, for ye shall soone be hāged by the necke. Syr sayd Richard speake more courteouslye yf it please you. For I shal see you sooner be flein quicke than ye shall see me hange, nor ye shall not be so hardye to doo so, what someuer ye prate, saye or cra∣ke. Charlemayne sayd, ye shall not scape me but ye shall be hanged or nyghte, and wolde God I helde as fast youre bretherne, and Mawgys that theef as I holde you nowe, for they shoulde be hanged wyth you to beare you company, because ye should not be afetde. And thus as Rycharde stroue with Charlemayne: he turned hymselfe and sawe Mawgys behin∣de hym that helde him selfe styll le∣nynge vpon hys staffe, and he knew hym well wherof he was wel gladde for he wyst well he shoulde not dye syth Mawgys was there. And whā Richarde had seen Mawgis: he was sure of his lyfe, and sayde to Charle∣mayne. Syr where shall I be han∣ged tell me? certes sayd Charlemaine at the gybet of Mountfawcon &amp; there shall your brethern maye see you, and Mawgys youre cosyn. Syr it is no reason that such a mā as I am should be hanged, but make peace with vs &amp; ye shal doo wysly, and yf ye doo not so: ye shall sore repente it as I trowe. And whan Mawgis had hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e all that he wolde heare: he made no lon∣ger taryinge, but he went out<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the pauyllion and sayde no worde, and whan he was out of it: he beganne to walke so greate a pase that no horse myghte not haue folowed hym, and passed throughe the wood of the ser∣pent and dyd so muche that he came to Mountawbā, where he found Rei∣nawde and his folke that wayted for him. And whan Reinawd sawe him come without Richarde: he was full sory so that he fell do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne in a swou∣ne. And Alard and Guycharde tooke hym vp and saide to him. Fayre bro∣ther ye doo as a chylde, ye oughte not to make suche a sorowe. Holde your peace traytours sayd Reynawd for ye haue lost the best knyghte of the worlde, for I see Mawgis come alone, wherfore I beleue that Richa∣rde is deade, for yf he were a lyue: Mawgys wolde haue broughte hym with him. For he neuer myssed of no
<PB REF="98"/> thing that he tooke in hand. And whā Alard, &amp; Guychard vnderstood these wordes: they tooke therof so greate a sorowe that they fell both downe in a swoune to the earthe, and whan they were come againe to theim selfe they made so great sorow that it was pytie for to see. And this hāging: cam there Mawgis. And whan he sawe the great sorow that his cosyns made: he was wrothe for it, and sayde to them. What eyleth you faire cosyns that ye make so euill cheere. Alas Mawgys said Reinawd, what is doone of oure brother Richard. Cosyn sayd Maw∣gis Richard is yet in prison, but Char¦lemaine hath saide that he shall make him to be hāged at the gybet of moūt∣fawcon, and hathe sayde that ye shall not keepe him longe a liue leste ye and I should rescue him, and heere is .xx. li. of money that Charlemayne hathe gyue me in his pauillion and made me haue both meat, and drynke, at my pleasure. Nowe shall it be seen yf ye loue Richard, &amp; if ye be a good knight or not, for ye must succour and deliuer him by force of armes or elles he shal die, for all the world shal not keep him otherwise therfro.</P>
<P>REinawd was wel recomforted whan he heard Mawgis spea∣ke: and after he sayd, sith that it is so y<SUP>e</SUP> Richarde is yet aliue: if I had but my selfe, my brethern, and Mawgis, yet should I keep Richard fro death maw¦gre the power of Charlemayne, &amp; thā Mawgis without any longe abiding tooke of his cope &amp; his hod, and tooke an herbe &amp; eat it, &amp; anon the swellinge went fro him, &amp; whan he was armed: he presented himself to Reinawd, and incontinent all his brethern put them selfe in armes, and anon they tooke their way toward mountfawcō. And whan they were come to a bowe shot nyghe fro it: Reynawde sayde to hys folke. Lordes if ye euer loued me: thin¦ke for to doo nowe so muche that my brother Richard may be rescued from this shamefull death. For I promyse you that I shal brynge hym with me, or els I and my bretherne and Maw∣gys shall die with him. Syr sayde his men doubte not of vs, for we shal doo oure deuoyre. Brother sayde than A∣lard, let vs lyghte heere down, and let vs hyde oure selfe within that bushe that we see yonder, for yf we were seen: the frenshmen mighte kille oure brother Richarde, or euer they wolde come. Brother said Reynawd ye spea¦ke wisely, and than they lyghted down a foote, and put themselfe in a busshe∣ment within a wood that was nighe mountfawcon. Reinawd at the ryght side of it. Alard at the left side &amp; wyth him Guichard and Mawgis.</P>
<P>HOw they were sent to y<SUP>e</SUP> plaine of Valcoloures ye haue well hearde, and the paine that reynawd &amp; his bretherne suffred and than howe they wente and succoured kynge yon of Gascoyn that had betrayed theim. And howe reynawde dyd fyght wyth Rowland, wherof he was sore tra∣uaylled, and hadde been all ready three daies without slepe, and therfore ye oughte not to be merueiled yf Rey∣nawde his bretherne and mawgis fel a slepe, and to say the trothe as soone as Reinawd, his bretherne and mau∣gys
<PB N="xciii" REF="98"/> were enbushed vnder the sarpyn trees they fell into so harde a slepe, that they forgate Richard. Now god for his pytie, haue pytie vpon him, &amp; keep him. For otherwise he must die.</P>
<P>NOw shal we tel you of Char∣lemaine that was in his pa∣uyllio, he called to him the duke Nai∣mes and Richard of Normandy and saide to them. Lordes what counseil gyue you me? ye knowe that Richard the soone of Aymon is of great pow∣er, I feare me that Reynawde shall come to succoure hym, whan I shall sende him for to be hanged, and ther∣fore I must send company for to with stande Reynawde, his bretherne and Mawgis. And thus as the king and the duke Naymes spake togither: he looked before him &amp; sawe Berenger of valoys, and called him and said to him. Berenger ye are of my men for ye holde of me scotlande &amp; Wales, ye oughte to come serue me in Fraunce with all youre power euery yere once whan I haue need. I shall now quite you and release vnto you all the ser∣uise that ye owe me, to you &amp; to youre heires for euermore so y<SUP>t</SUP> ye will take richarde the sonne of Aymon and see that he be hanged and strangeled at mountfawcon. And yf reynawd com there for to rescue hym: I praye you that ye wil take in hand my quarell. Syr said Berenger I see well now that ye loue me but a lytell, whan ye sende me to doo suche a deed, it were to me a great shame yf I dyd it, for nothynge that is to my dysworshippe I wyll not doo wyth my good wil, and also ye ought not to counseyll me to it nor suffre me to doo so, yet haue I leuet to serue you as my dutye is for to doo, than that I should doo the same that ye wolde put me to. And whan Charlemaine sawe that Be∣renger wolde not doo it: he called to therle Guydellon &amp; said to him. Gui∣dellon ye be my man and holdeth Ba¦uyere of me, and ye ought to serue me at any time that I call you with three thousand men, yf ye will goe hange Richard the sonne of Aymon: I shall make you free, and shall giue you the citie of Mascon. I wil not doo it said therle Guydellon. But I tell you for certeine that Richarde shall haue no harme if I may help him fro it to my power. Than saide Charlemayn goe oute of my sighte for ye be no good men. And than he saide to Rycharde by god yet shall ye be hanged in dis∣pyte of theym. Than called Charle∣mayne Ogier the dane, and saide to him Ogier ye be my man, it is shew∣ed vnto me that ye did the other daye treasō ayenst me in the plain of Val-colours for loue of Reynawde, nowe shall it be seene if it is true or not. Yf ye wyll goe hange Richarde: I shall gyue you the cite of Lion, and I shall gyue you quit of al the seruise that ye owe me &amp; youre heyres also for euer∣more. By the faith that I owe to you sir I shall not doo it, for ye wot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Richard is my cosin germayne, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I tell you that who so euer shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ge Richard the sonne of Aymon: I de∣fie him, and I shal helpe Reynawde with al my power. Goe from me said Charlemayne. Goddes curse haue ye, neuertheles by my bearde sayde
<PB REF="99"/> he yet shall be hanged. And whan he had saide so: he called to him the bys∣shoppe Turpyn and sayd to hym. Ye byshop I shal make you Pope of ro∣me yf ye will hange Richard, syr said the byshop Turpyn, what say ye? ye knowe wel that I am a preeste, yf I dyd so: I should lese my masse and be reguler, and also ye knowe well that rycharde is my cosyn. Wolde ye that I shoulde commyt treason vpon my kynsmen? certes it were ayenst rea∣son. So help me god said Charlemai∣ne ye leaue it neither for kynred nor for masse, but as a cowarde ye leaue it onelye for feare that youre crowne should be beat.</P>
<P>THan called Charlemayne Sala∣mon of breton &amp; said to him, Sa∣lamon ye knowe well that ye be my man and that ye holde Breten of me, I shal giue you the duchie of An∣som yf ye will hange rycharde the sonne of Aymon. Syr answered Sa∣lamon, if it please you to commaunde me any other thinge I wil be readye to doo it with a good will, but this I will not doo. And I tell you for cer∣tayne that rycharde shall haue no harme yf I maye. Salamon sayd the kinge, ye be a traytoue sith that ye wyll not doo my commaundemente. And after this: he sayde Richarde I will that ye knowe well that ye shal be hanged in dyspite of all thy kyns∣men. Syr saide richarde perauenture it shall be other wise thanye weene. and than Charlemayne turned hym selfe towarde Rowlande, and said to hym Fayre nenewe goe and see that he be hāged I pray you. For it is well reason that ye doo thoffice, syth thar all the frenshemen haue faylled me, and also ye haue taken him, wherfore ye must needes hange him, and I shal gyue you Coleyn vpon the ryn and so many other countreys that ye shal haue ynough. Sir answered rowland yf I dyd this: I shoulde be taken for a traytour. For I haue answered ry∣charde afore that I tooke hym that he shoulde haue no harme of his bo∣die, and yf ye make hym dye: no man shall neuer truste me vpon my faith. wherfore I praye the .xii. peeres of Fraunce that none of them wyll take the charge vpon hym for to see hym hāged, for yf he were hāged: I should be diffamed. And I promise you that who shall hange Rychard: I shal goe to Reynawde and shall put my selfe in his pryson, and yf he wyll pardon me hys brothers deathe: I shal help him vnder my othe ayenst all menne with three thousande fyghtinge men well atayed on horsebacke. Neuewe sayde than Charlemaine the deuyll speed you, ye ben al false vnto me.</P>
<P>ANd whan Charlemaine saw that he might not bring his wyll about for to hange Richard: he was so wrothe that he shooke for an∣gre, and rose vpon his feete and said. Lordes ye knowe well that I am the sonne of kinge Pepin and of the Quene Bethe, my father was nori∣shed in Fraunce, and I sledde in to Spayn to Alaffre vpon the sea. And there I dyd so manye meruaylles of armes that I was made knyght
<PB N="xciiii" REF="99"/> and dyd conquere salien my loue that forsoke .xv. kynges bearinge crowne for my sake and she came with me in to fraunce, and than I was crowned kinge accordinge to the righte of my patrimony, and than I dyd wedde the sayde ladye Galyne with ryghte great ioye and weend to haue had my realm in peace, but the same day that I was crowned: the .xii. peeres of Fraunce purposed to haue made me dye at christmasse next followynge, but our lorde sent me an aungell and made him to tell me that I shoulde goe hyde my selfe, the whiche I dyd so and I durste not saye ayenst it, nor I wyst not where I should hyde me, but god wolde that I shoulde fynde Basō a great theef, that brought me in to a pytte, and this hanginge men conspired my death, but Bas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shew∣ed me al togither and through his ai∣de I tooke myne enmyes, and I pu∣nyshed them afterwarde at my wyl, and so shall I doo by you, if there be any that wil doo contrary to my wil. And I am delybered to enquire eche of you by this maner for to see who shall be false or true to me. Whan Charlemaine had sayde this: he tur∣ned towarde the sonne of Oedon and sayde to him. Escoufe come forth I haue brought you to greate honoure and we haue nouryshed you ful dear∣ly, ye knowe that ye holde langres of me, yet shal I doo to you muche more good than I haue doone, for I shall gyue to you therldome of mounfer∣taunt &amp; of cleremount so that ye will goe hang that whoreson Richard, sir sayd Escoufe ye wot well that more Oedon holdeth all the londe that ye speake of, and I had neuer nothynge therof, but I am felaw with Row∣lande in armes. And whan I shal be lorde of that lond that my father hol∣deth in his hand: I shal fulfyll youre commaundement, by saint Denis of Fraunce ye must goe see that he be hā∣ged said Charlemain and I shal ma∣ke you lorde of mo londes. Syr sayd Estorfawd, is it earnest that ye spea∣ke? yea saide Charlemayne. By my head sir saide Estorfawde, ye wolde not be with me for to see Richard hā∣ge for halfe of your realm. Whan the kinge heard that he was thus repre∣ued: he tooke a staffe and cast it after Estorfawd, but Estorfawd stert from his place, and the staffe brake in pee∣ces ayenst a post. And whan the .xii. peeres saw that: they went all oute of the pauyllyon of Charlemayne, and whā that Charlemain returned him, and saw that none of all the .xii. pee∣res wolde abyde there with him:</P>
<P>Than he saide to the duke Naymes where be my .xii. peeres gone? sir said duke Naymes, they ben all gone out of your pauillion, and not without a cause, for it becometh not to suche a noble kinge as ye be to smyte his ba∣rons, for ye should be sore blamed.</P>
<P>THan whan Charlemayn saw this: he called to him Richard of montrolonde &amp; saide to hym, come foorthe Rycharde of montrolonde, heare what I shal tell you, ye knowe well that ye be one of theym that I loue best in this worlde but ye must doo one thinge at my request. It is that ye wyll goe hange Richarde the sonne of Aimon at the gybet of moūt¦fawcon.
<PB REF="100"/> Than Richarde of montro∣londe answered. Syr I shall doo so with a good wyl, for I am your man and so I ought not to refuse your cō∣maundemente, but by my soule syr Emperour yf ye will that I goe han∣ge Richarde: ye shall come with me with a thousand knightes well ar∣med, and I shall hange hym where soeuer to please you. And if Reinawd and hys bretherne come there for to rescue: I shall ieoparde mine owne body for to saue youres.

<P>THe kinge than called to hym the duke Naymes, and sayde to him. What counseill gyue you? syr syr sayd the duke Naimes, good if ye wyll beleue me, sir ye wot that Rey∣nawde, his bretherne, and Mawgis are the best knightes of Fraunce, as euery man knoweth well, this warre hath lasted ryght longe. For it is wel xvi. yeres that it began fyrst, and ma∣ny a noble knight hathe be slayne for the same, if it please you ye shall send worde to Reinawde, Alarde, Guy∣chard, and Mawgys that they wyl become your men, and ye shall dely∣uer agayne vnto them theyr brother Rycharde alyue, and that ye wyl doo make Reinawde and Alarde of the xii. peeres of Fraunce. And whan Reinawd &amp; his brethern shal se that ye haue doone to theym so great wor∣shyp: they shall serue you with good herte, and so that ye shall con them greate thanke for it, and I ensure you ye shal be the more dredde and more redoubted for cause of theym, and yf ye haue once the foure bretherne and Mawgis theyr cosyn to youre freen∣des: there shall be no prynce in all christendom so hardy that dare moue watre ayenst you, and I promise you syr that the more that ye keepe thys warre ayenst them: the more shall ye lose therby, and moreouer they be all of our house by theyr father Aymon, this know ye wel, and thefore I can not hate them by no wyse, Naymes sayd Charlemaine. I will not doo so for they all haue doone amys ayenst me and so shall I doo hange Richard by the faithe of my bodye, syr sayde the duke Naymes ye shall not doo so and god wyll, for he is of greate lyg∣nage &amp; of our lignage, for we shoulde neuer maye suffre it nor endure, and ye also shoulde be blamed ful sore for it. But and ye wyl make hym dye: I shall gyue you better counseyll. Tell me howe sayd Charlemayn, &amp; I shall doo it, yf it semeth me good, Syr sayde the duke Naymes syth it please you that Richarde shall dye: let him be cast into a deep prison vn∣der the earthe, and make him to be kepte surely therin that he scape not awaye, and commaund that no meat at all be broughte vnto him, and so shall he dye for hungre. And ye shall not be blamed if ye doo so. Naymes sayde the Emperour Charlemayne, ye doo Iape with me. I knowe it wel whan ye doo tell me this, ye knowe well that Mawgis is to great a ni∣gromancer. For I should neuer may keepe Richarde in pryson, but that Mawgis wolde haue hym out tho∣rough
<PB N="xcv" REF="100"/> his craft, and therfore I wyll not doo as ye say. Than came Ogier the dane, and said to the duke Nay∣mes, ye make to longe a sermon, let y<SUP>e</SUP> kinge doo with it, as it pleaseth him, For the more that ye praye him: the worse shall he doo, but he shall ma∣ke peace whan he see that he can no∣ne otherwise doo. But this daye shal be seen who loueth richard. And whā Ogier had said this: he went oute of the pauillion, and Escoufe with him and Richarde of Normandy, the by∣shop Turpin and Guidellon of Ba∣uyere, and made theyr folke to be ar∣med, &amp; whan they were armed: they were well .xii. thousande men. And than Ogier began to crie with a hie voice. Now shal it be seen who shal be so hardy for to leade Richarde the sonne of Aimon to hāgyng. For such shall bring him that neuer shal come againe, but he be headles, and Ogier went in to the pauyllyon where richarde was, that was bound both handes and feet, and was blindfeld. And whan Ogyer sawe rycharde that was thus arayed: he had of hym greate pytie, so went he to him to haue deliuered him, but he aduysed himselfe, and sayd that he should not doo it, but he wolde tary for to see an ende of it what the kynge should doo therof. And whan rycharde hearde Ogier speake: he called to hym and said in y<SUP>e</SUP> presēce of the duke Naimes and of rycharde of Normandye, of Guydellon of Bauyere, and of the byshoppe Turpyn, and of rowlande that than happed to com thete. Faire lordes I knowe well that yf it were at youre pleasure: ye wolde let me goe quyce, and all ynoughe ye haue tra∣uaylled youre selfe for me, wherof I thanke you right much, but syth that I must needes be brought vnto the galous: it is better that I poore vn∣happy die alone, than that ye should haue anie harme for my sake, wher∣fore looke that ye lose not the good grace of Charlemayne, and I praye you that ye will goe vnto hym and telle him that he doo his wyll vpon me, for I haue leuer die shortly, than to liue longe in sorow. Whan Ogier sawe rycharde speake so: he was so sorye for it that he fell almost downe to the grounde for greate sorowe in swoune, and saide to rycharde in an∣gre. What sayest thou foole detestable wylte thou be hanged? for yf we said the same that thou sayest to Charle∣mayne: all the golde of the worlde shoulde not saue thee, but that thou shouldest soone be hāged by y<SUP>e</SUP> necke. I care not saide Rycharde, happe as it happe wyll. And than he turned himselfe toward rowlande and sayde to him. I pardon you syr rowlande heere and afore god the faithe that ye haue promised me, and that ye gaue me whan ye tooke me afore Balancō And whan Ogier heard this: he wex∣ed almost mad for greate angre, and saide to rowlande. Syr beleue not rycharde, for he speaketh as a man that is vexed in his spirites, and not without a very great cause, but keepe vnto him the fayth that ye haue pro∣mised to him, for it shall be youre greate worshyp, yf ye doo so. Ogier said Rowlande, doubte not. I shall keepe to Richard al that I haue pro∣mysed him and more. Whan rychard
<PB REF="101"/> hearde that worde: he called to hym Ogier &amp; sayde. Fayre cosyn for god keep your peace, for I haue seen here Mawgis ryght now, and I wot wel he hath not forgotten me.

Cosyn sayde Ogier is it trouth that ye saye that ye haue seen Maw∣gis heere? yea saide Richard without any faute, than saide Ogyer, blessed be the good lorde of these tydinges, now haue I no doubte of Rycharde sith that my cosin knoweth of it. And than all the .xii. peeres of fraūce ligh∣ted a foote, and came to kynge Char∣lemayne and sayde to him. Syr we ben all your men sworne to you.

<P>THan sayde Charlemayne, by my faith now ye speake wel and wyselye, &amp; now I pardon you al, and than Charlemaine called to hym Ripus of ryplemond and said to him Rypus if ye wil doo so muche for me that ye will goe hange Rycharde: I shall make thee lorde of great londes and ye shall be my chamberleyne all your lyfe. Syr saide rypus I am all redy to fulfyl your commaundemēt, for Reynawd slewe my vncle besyde balancon, ye speake now wel said O∣gyer, ye shall be a cowarde but yf ye auenge your selfe at this tyme. And whan rypus vnderstood Ogier spea∣ke thus: he thought him self the more sure for it, and ryghte humbly and curteousli he kneeled down tofore the emperour Charlemaine, and kyssed his feete &amp; after he said to him. Syr I am ordeyned for to doo you seruice and youre commaundemente. If it please you ye shal make me sure that whan I shal come again fro the han∣gyng of Richarde: that none of your xii. yeeres shall not a waite me none euyll turne for it afterward. By my fayth said Charlemayne I wyll doo so with a good wil. And than he said to Rowlande and to Olyuer, and to al the twelue peeres of fraunce. Lor∣des I will that ye promise him that he shall not be hurte by none of you, nor in time to come by no maner of wise, by cause I make hym to hange Rycharde. The whiche thinge all the xii. peeres promised hym with a good wyll. And whan typus hadde taken the othe of the .xii. peeres of fraunce for his suretye: he went to his owne tente, and made him to be armed, And whan he was armed: he lyghted on horsebacke, and came before kyng Charlemain. And whan the Empe∣rour sawe him: he sayde to hym. Ry∣pus take a thousand knightes with you for to keep you, and if Reynawd or Mawgis come there: take them and hange them with Rycharde. Sir saide rypus I shal doo your commaū¦demente. And than the kynge made theym delyuer Richarde. And whan rypus hadde him: he put him to the waye and mounted Richard vpon a mule, and put a halter at his necke &amp; so led him forth lyke as it had be a stronge theefe, and broughte him be∣fore the pauyllyon of Charlemayne. And whan the kynge sawe him: he was glad of it and sayde to rypus. wolde god that all the other sonnes of Aymon were in the plyghte that Richard is now in, for I should well auenge you and my selfe also vpon them.</P>
<P>WHan the frenshemen saw ry∣charde that was led to han∣gynge so vilaynouslye: they beganne to make suche a sorowe for hym that it was meruayl, so that none so great was neuer seen. Rypus rode on his waye and dyd so muche that he came to Mountfawcon. And whan ripus dyd see the Galous set vp: he sayde to rycharde. By god rycharde see yonder is youre lodgynge, where ye shall be hanged by myne owne han∣des, thys daye shall be auenged the deathe of Foulques my vncle that Reynawd slew besides Balancon, y<SUP>e</SUP> succoures of Mawgys is now ferre fro you, for he can not keepe you, but
<PB REF="102"/> that I shall hange you now in dyspite of Reinawde and of youre other bre∣therne. whan rycharde hearde rypus speake so proudly &amp; saw that he was so nyghe the gybet, and that he sawe no succours cominge of no parte: he was sore agast and a ferde, &amp; thought he wolde keep rypus with wordes &amp; saide to him. Ripus for god haue pi∣tie vpō me, for I am no man y<SUP>t</SUP> should be hanged by reason, but I ought to be delyuered with you, and if ye wyll deliuer me: I shal giue you two hun∣dred marke weight of fyne golde, and I shal make you a greate lorde. Cer∣tes rycharde said ripus ye speake for nought, for I wolde not leaue you but that ye should be hanged for .x. of the best cities of fraunce. Rypus said Rycharde sith that ye will not haue pitie vpon my body: haue pitie vpon my soule, and I prai you as much as I can that ye wyll make a preest come to me for to shryue me, certes sayd ri∣pus ye shal haue one with right good wyll. And thanne he made come a preest, some sayen that it was a bys∣shop for to shriue richarde, the which began to shriue himselfe and shewed to the preest manie moo sinnes than euer he dyd in hys dayes, and this he dyd for to lengthe the tyme, and to see if he should haue any succours or no. And whan Richarde sawe that his helpe came not: he wexed almost mad, &amp; said to his confessour. Syr I wot not what I should more say, giue me absolucion, &amp; he gaue him penaun¦ce accordinge to the terme of hys lyfe and the confessour went from him all weeping. And whan rypus sawe that richard was confessed: he came to him and put the halter aboute hys necke, and made him moūt vpon the ladder &amp; dyd shyt the cheyne wherat he should hange. And whan rycharde sawe that his bretherne came not for to saue him: he wende none other but that he shoulde haue died, and delybe∣red hymselfe for to suffre death at the houre, and than he said to ripus. My freend I pray thee for God that thou suffre me a while till I haue saide an oryson that I dyd lerne in my youth to the ende that god haue mercye on my soule. I wyl not sayd ripus, thou shall haue no lenger respyte. Syr sayde his men, yes, ye shall if it plea∣se you.

<P>NOwe shall we speake of bay∣arde the good horse of Rey∣nawd, of his brethern and Mawgis.

So lept Reynawd vpon his feet al afrai∣ed and behelde what it was and loo∣ked toward Mountfawcon and saw his brother vpon the ladder, so made he none other tarying but lighted vp∣on bayarde that ranne as the wynde, for at euery time he lepte .xxx. foote in a playne grounde. And Alarde, Guy∣charde, and Mawgis awoke for loue of bayard that made greate noyse.</P>
<P>And whan they were all awaked: Mawgis began to crye as hyghe as he coulde vpon his horse, the deuyll speed the euyll beast that thou hast let me slepe so longe, and than he lyghted quickly vpon his backe, for ther was no better horse in all the worlde after bayarde.</P>

<P>WHan Rypus of riplemōde that wolde haue strangled Richard saw come his bre¦therne and Mawgys: he was so sore abashed with it that he wist not what he shoulde doo, &amp; he sayde than to Ri∣charde. richarde ye be delyuered oute of my handes, for here comen Rey∣nawd and Mawgys, and all theyr puyssaunce that come for to succoure you, and yf it please you, ye shall haue mercye on me. For this that I dyd for to haue brought you heere: it was but for to haue a waye the debate that Charlemaine had with the .xii. peeres of Fraunce, and I knewe well that ye should be rescued without any faut by youre bretherne and of Mawgys Ripus saide richarde mocke not w<SUP>t</SUP> me, for heere is to harde a mocke for me, and ye wynne not muche by for to gabbe me of this facion. By my soule saide ripus I mocke you not, it is in good ernest that I saye, ye maye see them heere not a bow shot a ferre nor I seeke not to doo you any harme but goe downe fro the ladder, and ha∣ue mercy on me I beseche you for god¦des loue.</P>
<P>RYcharde was meruelouslye a∣bashed whan he hearde ripus speke, and he turned his heade a syde and sawe reynawd that came a good pase, and whan he sawe hym: he sayde rypus I shall neuer clayme my bro∣ther reynawde for my brother, yf he hange you not by the necke to the sa∣me gybet where as ye thought to haue hanged me ryghte nowe. This han∣gynge that richard spake to ripus: reynawde was aryued and hearde this that Richard had sayd to Rypus. And Reynawde beganne than to crye with highe voice, so helpe me God Ripus ye be deade, for ye be a cursed man, and for youre cursednes: I shall hange you my owne selfe at this gy∣bet, so shall you be possessoure of my brother Richardes place, for al the po∣wer that Charlemayne shal make: shall not saue you therfro. This han∣ging: came there Mawgis sore chau∣fed &amp; said to Ripus. Ha Ripus thou traitour euil man ye haue alwaies be readye to doo some euil againste vs, but sith that I haue founde you heere I shall not seeke you no where elles, &amp; than Mawgis bare vp his spere for to haue perced his body therwith, but Reinawde cried vpon hym, Cosyn touche him not, for I wolde not for a greate thinge that a nother thanne I should slea him, for I shal auenge vp∣on him my deere brother richard, and than he drewe oute Flamberge and smote ripus with it such a stroke that he felled him dead to cherch at the foo∣te of the ladder, and after he sayde to his bretherne, keep well that none of his folke scape but that they be deade or taken. And than reinawd descen∣ded a foote and went vpon the ladder, and tooke richarde betwene hys ar∣mes and brought him downe, and vn∣bound him handes and after he kyssed his mouthe and sayd to him.

And whan richarde was well a parelled: Reynawde too∣ke the halter that rypus had put a∣boute Richardes necke, and put it a∣boute Ripus necke and after he moū¦ted vpon the laddre and drew him al dead, &amp; hanged him there as he wolde haue hanged Richarde, and with him wel .xv. mo of hys company such as king Charlemayne loued most.

Cosin tell me who waked you so wel in time as ye were? cosin said Reynawde, by the fayth y<SUP>t</SUP> I owe to god I slept as harde as though I had not slepte in .xii. nightes afore, but bayarde my gentil horse awoke me, than sayd Mawgys.

<P>Now it is well seene Rycharde that ye had few freendes. And wyth this he spurred his good horse Brayford and came agaynst Rycharde, for he trowed verely that it had be Ripus.

And than he spurred y<SUP>e</SUP> horse with the spurres &amp; came to Richard weenyng to him that it had ben Ri∣pus and sayd to him, come nere my specyall freende Ripus, and take no feare of nothynge. For I shall keepe you agaynst all men. Whā Rycharde heard Charlemayne speake thus: he sayde to hym. I wyll that ye knowe now y<SUP>t</SUP> I am not the false traytoure Ripus, but I am Richarde the sōne of Aymon, and I am the brother of Reynawde the beste knight of all the worlde, and of Alarde and of Guy∣charde, and cosyn to the valyaunte Mawgis that ye loue so muche, ye smote me to day in y<SUP>e</SUP> mornyng with a staffe in the head, whereof ye mys∣dyd greatly, and therfore my brother Reynawde hath hanged your ryght welbeloued rypus there as he wold haue lodged me, and .xv. of his fela∣wes with hym for to beare hym fe∣lawshyp, now beware of me for I defye you. Whan Charlemayne vn∣derstode these wordes: he was so sore an angred of it y<SUP>t</SUP> none can be more, and spurred his horse and ran vpon Rycharde, &amp; Richarde agaynst him, and gaue y<SUP>e</SUP> one to the other so great strokes in theyr sheldes y<SUP>t</SUP> they brake bothe theyr speres al ī peeres.

<P>GReate dylygence made Rey∣nawde for to succour Richard And whan he was come where he was: he cryed sodaynly Mountaw∣ban and Alarde pauereyment Guy∣charde Balācon &amp; Richarde, ardeyn and Mawgis went &amp; ranne vpon a knight that was called magon other wyse Sampson Lorde of Pierrefrit and rought hym suche a stroke: that he felled hym dead to the grounde, &amp; Reynawd smote vpon another kni∣ght by suche a wyse thar he shoued his swerde throughe and throughe his bodye, &amp; Guycharde smote ano∣ther with hys swerde so fyersly that he cleued his head in two peces, &amp; A∣larde smote the fourth knyght vpon his helme so great a stroke y<SUP>t</SUP> he caste hym dead to fore hys feete, &amp; after he ranne vpon another knyght ryche∣ly arayed and gaue eche other suche strokes that they bothe fell downe from theyr horses to the erth, &amp; than came there Reynawde y<SUP>t</SUP> dyd so mu∣che that the sayde knyght was taken prysoner, whych was called Hughe of Almayne &amp; brought hym to moū¦tawban. what shal I tel you more? y<SUP>e</SUP> batayle began to be fell, &amp; so cruel that it was great pitie for to se, for y<SUP>e</SUP> one spared not y<SUP>e</SUP> other, but slew eche other as thicke as beastes.

And as he spake these wordes: came there king Char¦lemayne as fast as his horse myght walop agaynst Reynawde, and Rey∣nawde against him, bicause he knew him not, &amp; smote eche other so harde in theyr sheeldes y<SUP>t</SUP> they made theyr speres to flee in peces, and recoūtred together bothe with theyr bodyes &amp; sheeldes so meruaylously that they ouerthrew eche other to the ground, and than they rose quicklye bothe at ones &amp; set hande to theyr swerdes, &amp; than Charlemayne began to crye Mountioye Saynte Denys, and af∣ter sayd, if I be outraged by one kni∣ght only: I ought not for to be a kīg nor to bere crowne. Whā Reynawde vnderstode Charlemayne speake: he knew him well &amp; withdrewe hīself a side &amp; sayd. Alas how am I dyffa∣med? it is charlemayn to whom I ha¦ue

Sir for God I crye you mercy, gyue me tre∣wes tyll that I haue spoken wyth you. With a good wyll sayd Charle∣mayne, but I wote not who ye be: how be it that ye haue iusted w<SUP>t</SUP> me.

<P>THan whā Charlemayn hear de Reynawde speake thus he answered hym and sayde.

I promyse you for certayne that ye shall haue no peace with me, but yf ye doo that I shal tell you. Syr said Reinawde what shall that be tel me I pray you? I shall shewe it to you wyth a good wil sayd Charlemayne and if ye doo it, ye and your brethern shall accorde wyth me, and I shall gyue you agayne your heritage, and yet I shal gyue you ynough of myne owne. It is that ye gyue me Maw∣gis in my handes for to doo my plea¦sure with hym. For I hate him more than ony thyng in the worlde. Syr sayd Reynawde, yf I should deliuer hym to you, what wolde ye doo to hī Reynawde sayd Charlemayne I {pro}∣myse you I should make hym to be drawen shamefully at foure horses tayles through Parys, &amp; after that I should take from the body of hym the lymmes one after another, and than I should make hym to be brent and his asshes to be cast at the winde And whan he shall be arayed as I tell you: let hym than doo his incā∣tacions &amp; his magyke as he wyll, &amp; I pardon hym all that he can doo to me after y<SUP>•</SUP>. Than sayd Reynawde to the Kynge. Syr wolde ye doo it
<PB N="Ci" REF="106"/> in deed as ye say? yea said Charlemay∣ne in good fayth. Emperour sayd Rei¦nawde wolde you not take townes ne castelles, golde nor syluer for the raunsom of Maugis? certes nay sayd Charlemayne. Syr sayd Reynawde than shall we neuer be accorded to gi¦ther. For I tell you for certeyn that yf ye had all my bretherne in your pry∣son, and that ye were delibered for to make them to be hanged: yet should I not gyue you mawgys for to haue them delyuered oute of your handes. Holde your peace than sayd Charle∣mayne and beware of me for other¦wyse get ye no peace wyth mee. Syr sayd Reynawde I am sory for it. for we be no men that ought to be caste from your sexuyse, and sith that ye de¦fye me: I shal defend me, and our lor∣de shall me doo that grace yf it please hym that I shall not betake of you. And whan Charlemaine heard this: he was sore angry and ranne vpon Reynawde. and whan Reynawde sa∣we hym come vpon hym he sayd to hī. Syr for god mercy suffre not that I sette hande vpon you, For if I should let my selfe for to be slayne by you: I wexe well a myschaūt. Vassayl sayd Charlemayne these wordes auaileth you not for ye muste needes defende yourself. And thā Charlemayne smo∣te hym with Ioyuse his swerde vpō his helme. and the stroke slided downe vpon the sheelde of Reinawde so that he kytted quyte and clene a great par∣te therof. Whā Reinawde felt so grea∣te a stroke that kynge Charlemayne had gyuē hym: he was sore an angred for it. He vaunced hym selfe foorth and caught the kyng with bothe his armes by the backe, &amp; by the waste in maner of wrastelynge. For he wolde not smyte hym with his swerde flā∣berge, and tooke &amp; layd him vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> necke of his horse baiard, for to haue brought hym with hym to Moun∣tawban without any other harme.</P>
<P>And whan Charlemayne sawe that he was hādeled of this fation: he be∣gan to crye as lowde as he myghte. Mountioye saynt Denys, and than he sayd, ha fayre nenew Rowlande, where be you? Oliuer of vyenne and ye duke Naymes, and bysshop Tur∣pyn, shall ye suffre that I be thus ta∣ken and brought as a prysoners and if ye doo so, it shal be a great shame to you al, Reynawde began thā to crye Mountawban as hyghe as he coulde whan he heard Charlemayne speake so. And after he sayd, ha my brethern and ye cosyn Mawgis come hyther, and let vs goe, for I haue gyuen the kyng suche a checke, that if we canne now brynge him with vs, wee shall haue peace in Fraūce frō hens forth on. Than the noble peres of Fraūce as Rowland, Oliuer, &amp; the other cam to the succours of Charlemayne, and of that other parte came there for to helpe Reynawde his bretherne and Mawgis, &amp; wel foure hūdred knigh∣tes well armed.

And whan Rowland was come to the meddle: he wente vpon Reynawde and gaue him so great a stroke vpon his helme that he was all astonyed therwith, and after he sayd to him. Vasell ye haue doone e∣uyll y<SUP>t</SUP> ye trowed to haue brought a∣way the king in this maner of wise, ye wot well it is to heauy a bourden for to lede of this facion, ye shal leue him, and yet ye shall abye full deere for it or ye escape me. And whā Rey∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wde saw that he was thus repre∣ued, and felt the great strooke y<SUP>t</SUP> row∣lande had giuen to him vpon his hel¦met: he was wrothe, and tooke hys swerde in his hande, holdyng alway∣es Charlemaine afore hym vpon bayardes necke &amp; came to Rowland and sayd to hym. Damp Rowlande come forthe so shall ye wyt how flā∣berge cutteth, And whan Rowlande vnderstode hym: he came vpō hym, &amp; whan Reynawde sawe hym come: he let fal downe Charlemayne &amp; ranne vpon Rowland. And there began a∣monge them two afiers medlynge. This hangyng: came Alarde, Guy∣charde and the lytle Rycharde, and ranne vpon Rowlande at ones and gaue hime so muche to doo that he muste put hymselfe to flyght wolde he or no. And whan Reynawde saw that Charlemaine and Rowlād had saued them self: he was ryght sorye for it, and he sayd to his bretherne. My bretherne ye haue wrought yll, for yf ye had be styll by me wee had doone a great fayt, for I had taken Charlemayne that wee should haue brought wyth vs to Moūtawban.</P>
<P>Syr sayde his brethern, we are sory for it that we dyd not so, but we had so muche to doo in a nother place y<SUP>e</SUP> it is well to vs y<SUP>t</SUP> we be scaped saue wyth our liues. But let vs see that wee doo well, and sowne our horne to the ende ye may gather agayne to∣gether your folke that be so sperkled abrode, for there is daunger bycause of the nyght that cometh so faste on, and call agayne your baner for we haue wonne more than we haue lost and let vs go to Moūtawban. Rey∣nawde that was sage dyd as his bre¦thern and Mawgis counselled him whan Charlemayne sawe that Rei∣nawde had withdrawe hys baner: he was glad of it, for he saw well that his folke was at the worste hande, so made he to sowne the retrete and passed Balancon, and did so muche that he came agayne to hys hoste.</P>
<P>And whan he was lyghted downe a foote: he sayde to hys folke.

And than theyr folke put themselfe in ordenaunce, and they abode behinde til that their folke had passed Balācon. And whā the moste part was passed: he tooke three thousāde men of the best of his folke and sayde to the other, go your wayes to Mountawban. For I wil goe &amp; assayle the kyng Charlemayn in his pauilion, what so euer it hap of it. And so shall I shewe his folke what I can doo, and that I am a man for to seeke hym and not he me</P>
<P>ANd whā Reynawde had sayd this: he came to the water of Balancon, and passed ouer with his three thousande men, And they rode so longe that they came to the hoste of Charlemayne, that was wrothe more than mesure requireth bicause that he had loste the feelde agaynst Reynawde. And whan Reynawde sawe the pauilion of Charlemayne: he sayd to his brethern, and to al his folke, I praye you y<SUP>t</SUP> ye gouerne you wysely. Syr sayd Richard the hardy he that wyll be enhaunced in pryce: he ought not to looke so nygh, but he must Ieoparde for to conquere wor∣shyp. And whan Richarde had sayd so: he set hande to his swerde, &amp; spur∣red his horse with the spurres and wente streyght to the pauylyon of Charlemayne, &amp; cut of the cordes &amp; made it fall downe to the erth with the Egle of golde massy that was of great value. Whan Reynawde sawe this: he called Mawgis &amp; said to him cosin come hyther, helpe me to bring a way this gayne, syr sayd Mawgis with a good will, and they lighted a foote &amp; tooke the Egle of golde that was so riche y<SUP>t</SUP> no man wilte what it was worth, &amp; Reynawde sayd to his folke. My lordes smite now well &amp; fayne not your selfe, he that begin∣neth a game: he ought to see an ende of it to his profyte yf he can. Who than had seene the folke of Charle∣mayne arme them &amp; com out of their tentes &amp; ranne vpon the sonnes of Aymon: he wolde haue meruayled, &amp; it was pitie for to see the great slau¦ghter that was doone there. Whan Mawgis had put the egle of golde in sure handes: he wente agayne to y<SUP>e</SUP> pauilion of Charlemayne &amp; he foūd the kyng &amp; sayd to him. By my head syr Emperour, ye haue troubled vs sore a longe whyle, but ye shall bye it ful deere at this houre your comyng into Gascoyne &amp; the death of my fa∣ther the duke benes of Aigremount. for I shal giue to you such a stroke y<SUP>t</SUP> ye shal neuer make warre to vs nor to none other.

<P>OVer longe taried Mawgis in the hoste of Charlemayne, for Reynawde was all redy passed ouer Balancon, and Rowland &amp; Oliuer were all redy come to the callinge of Charlemayne sore afrayed, &amp; whan Mawgis sawe them: he made no len¦ger taryinge, but gaue the spurres to his horse &amp; went after Reynawde as fast as his horse myght runne.</P>
<P>And whan he wolde haue passed ba∣lācon: he met wyth a great company of the folke of Charlemayne, and Mawgis smote one of them so hard in y<SUP>e</SUP> sheeld, y<SUP>t</SUP> he ouerthrew both horse &amp; man to the erth. And after that he smote the sonne of Mylen of Puyll so that he cleued his sheelde a sonder &amp; cast him downe to the grounde w<SUP>t</SUP> a wounde morta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, &amp; than he cryed Moūtawban &amp; sayd. Ha fayre cosin Reynawde where be you, succour me for god. for if ye lose me: ye shal haue harme therat. And than Mawgys thought well that Reynawde was gone, this hangynge: came Olyuer throughe the prese and came vpon Mawgis &amp; smote him so harde y<SUP>t</SUP> it abode not nother for sheelde nor for courset of steele, but he made hym a wounde in his breste, and caste hym downe to the erth.</P>
<P>WHan Mawgis felt hymselfe thus hurt and ouerthrowen: he was ryght wrothe for it. So rose he vp quickly vpon his feete &amp; tooke hys swearde in his hande &amp; did mer∣uayles of armes, and the nyght was very darke that almoste y<SUP>e</SUP> one knew not the other. And whan Oliuer saw Mawgys defende hymself so well: he sayde to him. I knowe not thee knight whom thou art, but and thou yeeld not thy selfe to me: I shall now smyte of thy head from y<SUP>e</SUP> shoulders. what is thy name sayd than Maw∣gys? for and thou be a good man I shall yeelde me to thee and els not, knight my name is Oliuer of Vien. whan Mawgys heard him named: he knew him well, and sayd to hym, Ha gentyll knight Oliuer I yeelde me to you vpon your fayth &amp; vnder suche a condycion that ye shall not delyuer me to Charlemayn, for if ye delyuer me in his handes I am dead wythout remedy &amp; he shall make me dye shamefully as a theefe. By my fayth sayd Olyuer this wyll I not doo for I dare not hyde you from Charlemayne, but yeelde you and I promise you y<SUP>t</SUP> I shal help you to my power for to make your apoyntmēt with the king, sir sayd Mawgys, &amp; I yeeld me to you vpon your trouth and tooke his swerde to hym &amp; Oly∣uer tooke it, &amp; after made hym to be lighted vpō a litle horse, &amp; brought him to the pauilion of Charlemaine where they foūd not y<SUP>e</SUP> kyng, bycause he was al afrayed as ye heard afore. And whan Oliuer saw that he foūd not Charlemaine: he was sore aferd y<SUP>e</SUP> Mawgys should scape from hym through his incantacions &amp; wytche crafte, and sayd to him, Mawgis ye know how I haue taken you by ar∣mes and that ye are my prysoner, I wyll y<SUP>t</SUP> ye gyue me your fayth truly

And whan Oliuer had taken the othe of Mawgys: he made him to be vnarmed, and made hys woūde to be wrapped: and gaue him a mantell vpon him and made hym to lye vpon a bed. Now shal we leue a litle to speake of Charlemayne, of Olyuer and of Mawgys. And shal shew of Reynawde and his brethern what they dyd whan the host of char¦lemayne was moued, and how they wonne the Egle of Golde that was of so great value, &amp; how Reynawde sayd to his brethern, lordes let vs se now for to quyte vs wel, for it were not good for vs for to tary heere ani lenger. And than he made to with∣draw his folke, and made them put to the waye. And as they wente: Ry∣chard sayd to Reynawde. Syr wee haue gotten a ryche proy thanked be God. For Charlemayne shall be ma∣ny a longe day wrothe therfore. Cer∣tes sayd Reynawde fayre brother ye saye trouth and also we haue slayne a great many of hys folke. Ha God sayde than Alarde, where is our co∣sin Mawgis? for I se him not heere Brother sayd Richard, be not aferde for Mawgys, for I beleue that he is gone to Mountawban afore vs, god be with hym wheresoeuer he be sayd Reynawde.

And whan he was come agayne to hym selfe: he sente for the duke Naymes the bisshoppe Turpyn, Escoufe the sonne of Oedon for Salamō of bre∣tayne, Richarde of Normādy, y<SUP>e</SUP> erle Guydellon and for Ogier the dane. And whan they were all gathered to¦gether: the kynge began to shewe to them his complayntes in thys ma∣ner Lordes I haue kepte and mayn∣teyned you vnder mi tuicion y<SUP>e</SUP> space of .xl. yeres and more that no man hath not wronged you of a penye, &amp; ye haue no neyghbour that dare as∣ke you any thinge. Now me semeth because that I am now olde that I am but half a man &amp; yet not so good as I wolde be, and I maye not be a kyng without you: for whan ye faile me I am no kynge, ye know well y<SUP>t</SUP> ye haue left me for loue of Reynawd wherof I am ryght sory as I maye well, for Reynawde hath taken me where I was habandoned of you, &amp; he hath chased me out of the feeld, certes I am worse thā mad of thys y<SUP>t</SUP> ye haue forsake me for Reynawde. And syth that it is thus wyth me: I seeke not to lyue anye lenger, nor to be kynge any more, and now I take to you the crowne to y<SUP>e</SUP> ende that ye shall gyue it vnto Reynawde whan ye wyll, and that ye make him king of Fraunce. For I wyll be no more
<PB N="ciiii" REF="109"/> your kynge.</P>
<P>WHan the .xii. peeres of Fraunce, &amp; the other lordes hearde Char∣lemayn speake so sorowfullye: thei were sore abashed that there was no man so hardye that durst saye one worde. And the one looked vpon the other and were abashed. And whan the duke Naimes of bauiere vnder∣stood the wordes of Charlemain: he put him self forth and said. Sir Em∣perour god forbyd that ye should doo as ye saye, for it were great shame to vs all and also to you, but I wot wel that we haue mysprysed ayenst you in that we haue supported Reinaw∣de, but ye oughte to consydre that we haue doone, was by no malyce: but for good entencion. For we wend for to haue made the peace of the warre that hath endured so longe, wherby many good true men are deade, but sith that we see, that it pleaseth not you to make peace with the four son∣nes of Aimō: take again your crow∣ne and be not wroth with vs, and we shal promyse you that we al shal ser∣ue you well and truely, and that we shal take Mountawban or a moneth be passed, or elles we shall die all, &amp; from hence forth on he that shal spa∣re the foure sonnes of Aimon, shal be slaine of vs. Than saide the kinge Charlemayne, lette all this alone I tell you for certaine that I shall ne∣uer be your kynge, but ye yeeld to me Reynawde or Mawgis the cursed theef that hathe mocked me so often. And whan Charlemaine had saide this: he entred within his pauilion so¦re an angred. And than came theere Olyuer that was sore abashed of y<SUP>t</SUP> he sawe the king make so euill chere, and after he saide to Charlemayne. Syr wherof are ye so sore angry? by my faith saide the duke Naymes he hath shamed vs, for he hath forsaken his crowne and his realme. Sir said than Olyuer doo not so, but take a∣yen your crown and be our lorde and our kyng. And who dooth not youre commaundemente: chastyse him in such a maner that mē take ensample therby. Olyuer saide Charlemayn, ye speake for nought, for I wyll not doo it, but I haue Reinawd or Maw¦gis dead or quicke, syr saide Olyuer now pardon vs than, &amp; I shal dely∣uer to you Mawgis or euyn.</P>
<P>DAmp Oliuer sayd Charlemain I am not a chylde, wherof men ought to mocke with. For I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oe well that Mawgis doubteth you of nothing. Syr said Olyuer, yf ye will promyse me that ye shall take again your crowne, and that ye shall keep vs as ye haue doone afore tyme: I shall bringe him nowe afore you, by my faithe sayde Charlemayne yf ye doo it, and that I maye haue hym at my will (for I hate hym most of all men in the worlde) I shal doo al that ye will desire of me, and also I shall giue you londes ynough that ye shal be contēt of me, for if Mawgys were not: the sonnes of Aymon myght not endure ayenst me, for yf I had them in prison, and thoughe I had sworn to keep them, yet shoulde that theefe Mawgis stele theym awaie fro me. Syr said Olyuer I shall bryng him to you witout any doubte. And than
<PB REF="110"/> Olyuer went to his pauylyon and Rowland with him, and many other knightes for to see Mawgis. Oliuer sayde then to Mawgis, Mawgys ye must come to Charlemayne. Oliuer saide Mawgys, ye haue betrayed me, but I wot well that Charlemai∣ne shall be more curteous than ye haue be, for he shall do me no harme, and let vs goe to him in the name of god whan ye wyll. And than Oly∣uer ledde Mawgys to Charlemai∣ne, and whan he was within the pauillion: he went streighte to the king and saide to him. Syr ye haue promised me that if I brought Maw¦gis: that ye should take againe youre crowne. And that ye should keep vs to right as ye haue doone afore time. Certes saide Charlemain it is trou∣the, and if ye keep your couenaunt: I shall doo that I haue promysed you. Now holde you sir saide Olyuer he∣re Mawgis, that I delyuer to you for to doo your pleasure with him the which I haue take and conquered by force of armes. Whā the kyng Char∣lemaine sawe Mawgis: he was so gladde that no man mighte be more, and after he saide, by my fayth nowe haue I one parte of my desyre, thou false theef Mawgys now I holde thee, nowe shalt thou be rewarded of thy pride that thou hast shewed to me whan thou barest awaye myne egle of golde, and for all the good turnes and theftes that thou hast doone in thy daies. For many times thou hast angred me sore, wherof thou shalte be nowe payed after thy deseruynge. Syr saide then Mawgis ye shal doo with me what it please you, for I am now in your handes, but I counseyll you for the best that ye let me goe and that ye make peace with Reinawde, and with his bretherne, for ye shall get no thinge by my deathe, and my cosins been such that they shall auē∣ge it right wel by force of armes, and if ye doo as I saie: ye shall haue with you the floure of knighthode of all the worlde. A theef said Charlemain how fearful thou arte now. Certes this that thou sayest shall auaylle the nothynge. Syr saide Mawgis I am no theefe. Now can I not doo no¦thing sith that I am in your handes. And whan ye shall haue put me to death: ye shal doo me no more nothin∣ge, and yet ye shal be sory for me or e∣uer .xiiii. houres comen at an ende. Rybawd saide Charlemaine, speake not so boldly, for &amp; I can: thou shalte haue an euil night or euer thou scape me, nor the glutons thy cosyns shall not helpe the therfro, but that I shall make the die in dispite of al thy witch craft that thou cannest doo. ☞ Now we shal leue a litel to speake of Char∣lemain and of Mawgis: and we shal speake of the good knight Reynawde Alard, of Guichard, and of the litylle Richard his brethern.</P>
<P>WHan Reynawd was departed from the hoste of Charlemayn as I sayde before: he rode so longe that he came to Mountawban and his folke with hym. And whan that lady wist that her lord came: she came him ayenst, and said to hym.</P>
<P>Sir ye bee righte welcome, ha∣ue ye deliuered Rycharde? yea,
<PB N="cv" REF="110"/> verely sayd Reinawde god gramer∣cy, and blessed be god sayde the lady. And than she went to Rycharde and kyssed hym more than ten tymes, &amp; there was a cheere and a feast made ryght amyable. And after they had made greate Ioye: Reynawd began to demaunde after hys cosin, and the lady answered, my lorde I knowe no tydynges of hym, and whan Rei∣nawde heard that: he was sore agast of it, and turned himselfe towarde hys bretherne and sayde to theym. My bretherne I praye you that we may know whether our cosyn maw∣gis is come or not, and goe seeke him in his lodges, for haply he is goe for to vnarme him selfe. And inconty∣nent Guicharde and Richard sought hym at thys lodges and asked for hym to two of his men, the whiche sayde that they had not seen hym sith he was gone with them. And whan they hearde that: they were full sory and went agayne to theyr brother Reynawde and tolde him howe they coulde not fynde hym. Whan Rey∣nawde vnderstoode that they hadde not founde hym, he beganne to make more sorowe than yf all his brethern had be deade, and than who had seen the greate mone that Alarde, Guy∣charde and the lytyll Richarde ma∣de for theyr cosyn: he wolde haue had greate pitie for to see theym, for they pulled theyr heres from theyr heades and scratched theyr visages, whan the good lady sawe the greate sorowe that Reinawde her husbande and his bretherne made, she fell downe in a swoune to the erth. I promyse you he that had seen that sorowe (how heard hearted that he were coulde) not haue kept him from weepyng.</P>
<P>AFter that Reynawde hadde thus made greate sorowe: he refrained himselfe a lytyll and than sayd. Ha my cosyn Mawgis well ye haue stolen your selfe from vs, and what shall we doo fro hence forth sith that we haue lost you? Whan they had made theyr mone in this maner a lō∣ge while: Remawde said to his bre∣therne and to his folke. My Lordes I pray you that ye leue your sorowe, for by no sorowe the matter can not be remedyed, I praye you recomforte yourselfe, for I wyll put me agayne to the waye for to goe to the woode of the serpent for to speake with the abbot of saynte Lazare to wyt yf he canne tell vs anye tydinges, for my hearte iudgeth me that afore .xxiiii. houres I shall knowe the certentie, and fare well my bretherne tyll I co∣me againe, ye speake well and wisely saide Alarde, but we shall goe with you for to keep you. Certes said Rei∣nawd, ye shall not come a foote with me: And thā Reinawd went in to his chambre, and made him to be armed, and came and lighted vpon bayarde his good horse, &amp; yssued out of moū∣tawban, the sheelde at the necke, and the spere in the hand and came to ba∣lancon, and passed ouer the water, &amp; whan he was ouer the water he foūd two laddes that came to water their horses from the host of Charlemain. whan the laddes sawe Reynawde that was so greate, and was all alone: they sayde to hym. Syr what be you that are alone, ye seme to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB REF="111"/> noble man. Children saide Reinawd I am of Rypus folke that dyd scape whan the sonnes of Aymon hanged hym at mountfawcon. And than he sayde agayne to theym. What dooth the valyaunt kynge Charlemaine? so it is supper tyme with hym. Syr said the laddes the kynge is well me¦rye and maketh good chere, &amp; he hath forgoten all the sorowe that he dyd make for your mayster Rypus. For men haue brought to him Mawgys that he hated so muche. Now tell me saide Reinawde is Mawgis deade? Syr saide the two laddes he is yet a liue. Whan Reynawde vnderstoode that Mawgys was a lyue: hys here lepte all in his bely for greate Ioye, and than he saide, my fayre chyldren blessed more you be syth that Maw∣gys is not dead. Now I feare me not that he shall dye this daye. All thus as Reinawde spake this: the laddes went their wayes, and Reynawde abode alone thynkynge at the ryuer syde, and whā he had thought ynou∣ghe: he saide to himselfe fayre God what shall I doo? I wote not nowe what shall I thynke or saye, for yf I goe assayle Charlemayne at his sup¦per: the night is derke, and he shall wen that I haue great folke with me and he shalbe aferde to leese Mawgis and thus he might kill him anon.</P>
<P>But sith that I knowe so muche of him: I shal tary till to morowe, and yf he bringeth him than for to be put to death: I shall defende him with mi power, or els I shal dye with him.</P>

<P>IN this party sheweth the histo¦rye that whan Charlemaine saw him seased of Mawgis: he cal∣led Rowland, Olyuer, Ogier the da∣ne, the bishop Turpyn, Richarde of Normandy, Guidellon of Bauier &amp; the Duke Naimes and said to them, My lordes I pray you as muche as I can that ye doo make a greate ga∣lous, for I am delybered that afore supper Mawgys the great theef shal be hanged by the necke, for yf all the worlde had sworne the contrary: yet shall I not keep him to the day were come. Syr saide the duke Naymes syth that it please you that Mawgis shall dye: ye shall make hym dye by a nother maner of wyse, if ye doo af∣ter me. And how than sayde Charle∣mayne? Syr I counseyll you that ye hange not Mawgis by nyght: for Reinawde and his bretherne should mocke you, and they shall saye that ye durst not make him dye by daye light for feare of theym, and therfore syr abide till the day become, and thā maye ye doo execucion vpon hym with worshyp. And whan the tyme shall become that ye wyll sende him forth: send many folke with him, that and Reinawde and his brethern co∣me there for to succure him: that thei may be take, and hanged with hym, Naymes sayde the kinge, ye mocke with me, for yf this theefe scape me: I am defamed. Syr sayde Mawgis, if ye be a feard that I should goe awai I shall giue you suretye that I shall not goe. Who is that saide Charle∣mayn that shal be thy surety? is there
<PB REF="112"/> nye man in the world that is so har∣die that dare take this? Syr, saide Mawgis I shal finde ynoughe yf it please you. Nowe shall we see saide Charlemain how ye shal finde them, and thā Mawgis looked about him, &amp; saw the twelue peeres: so called he Olyuer and said to hym. Syr Oly∣uer ye promysed me whan I yeelded me to you that ye wolde helpe me to∣ward Charlemayne. Now I require you that ye wyll be my suretye yf it please you, wyth a good wyll sayde Oliuer vpon my life and my goodes I shalbe your surery, and ye sir Row¦land, saide Mawgis shall ye not be also for god my surety? and ye duke Naymes, and ye Ogier, and ye Es∣couf, and ye byshop Turpyn, and ye damp Richarde of Normandye, and ye Guydellon of Bauyere, I praye you all that ye will be my surety for the loue of the good knight Reinawd Mawgys said than the duke Nay∣mes, will ye promyse to vs vpō your faithe that ye shall not goe from vs without our leaue? ye said Mawgis vpon my faith. And than came the duke Naymes, with the other peeres of Fraunce before the kyng Charle∣mayne, and said to hym. Sir we wil be suretie for Mawgys vpon our ly∣ues &amp; vpon our landes that we holde of you that he shall not goe a waye without your leaue, &amp; also of al your company, and we shall deliuer hym agayne to you to morow in the mor∣nynge for to doo with hym what ye wyll. My lordes saide the king sith that ye wyll be his suretie: I remyse him in to your keepynge, by suche a condicyō, but that I haue him to mo∣row in the morning erly: ye shal leese all your londes. And ye shall ne∣uer maye returne in to douce fraun∣ce again. Sir said Oliuer we graunt it as ye haue sayd. Lordes sayde the duke Naymes sith that this is doon: lette vs goe recomforte Mawgys, for he is well sory. Lordes sayd than Mawgis to them againe. Sith that ye haue doon me one good turne: doo me a nother. I pray you get me some meate, for I am yl a hungred. Whan Charlemayne vnderstoode Mawgis speake: he looked vpon hym, and said all laughinge. And shalte thou eate sayde Charlemaine? yea, said Maw∣gis if I can haue any meate. Nowe heare said Charlemaine, what it is of this deuil heere y<SUP>t</SUP> asketh for meate and so lytell a terme he hath to lyue. For &amp; I were in his plyght: I should not nowe haue courage for to eate. Syr sayd the duke Naymes ye saye yll, for who hath eaten well: he is the better at his ease wherof I pray you that ye let him haue some meat. And thenne the kinge washed his handes for to goe to soupper and said, where shall Mawgis be for to eate? syr said Rowlande, he shall well be by you. Neuewe said the king ye saie ryghte well, for heere shal we be sure of him and I hadde thoughte for to doo so. For I shoulde not date trust hym to none other man. And than the kinge was sette at the table, and he made Mawgys to syt nexte hym, and ser∣ued hym at the table, for as longe as the supper lasted: he durste not eate nor drynke, least that Mawgys
<PB N="cvii" REF="112"/> shoulde werke wytche crafte vpon him, but Mawgis eate ryghte wel, for he had a good appetit to his meat. And whan Oliuer sawe that: he be∣ganne to lawghe and shewed Row∣land and after saide to hym. Haue ye seen how the king durste not eate all this supper, for feare that maw∣gys should werke wytchecraft vpon hym. Surely sayde Rowlande, it is true. After supper Charlemaine cal∣led his stuarde, and sayde to hym, stuwarde I praye you brynge me .xl. torches, and that they brenne all the nyghte. Syr sayde the stuarde, I shal doo your commaundement. And whan Charlemayne hadde ordeined this: he retourned him toward Row∣lande and sayd to him. Fayre neuew I pray you that ye and Olyuer and al the twelue peeres of Fraunce that ye wyll watche to nyghte with me, for to keep this theef Mawgys, and make an hundred men to be armed, that shall watch with vs and make the play at the tables and at the ches∣ses, to thende that none of vs falle a sleepe, and also make a thousand kni∣ghtes to make good watch wythout to the ende that yf Mawgys should escape vs: thei should take him aga∣ine. And whan Charlemayne hadde ordeyned this: he set him downe vp∣on his bedde, and he made Mawgis to sit downe by hym. And of that o∣ther parte Rowlande, Olyuer, Ogi∣er the Dane, and all the twelue pee∣res rounde aboute the bedde. Syr sayde then Mawgys, where shal I sleep. What say ye said Charlemain wyll ye slepe? yea, sayde Mawgys full fayne, if please you to suffre me. By my soule sayde Charlemayne ye shall haue euyll reste heere, for ye shall not sleep as longe as ye be a ly∣ue. For ye shal be hanged to morow-at the spryngynge of the daye. Syr sayde Mawgis, ye doo me greate wronge. Wherfore haue I giuen you suretie, but only that I may haue my ease for so longe as I haue for to ly∣ue. Other suffre me to take my reste and that I may slepe: or elles holde quite my suretees, certes false theefe saide Charlemaine, all this shal not auayl thee. For I wyll that thy sure∣ties goe quite, and discharged. But therfore ye be not out of my handes. And than he made to be broughte a greate payre of yrens, and fetted him with them bothe hys feete togi∣ther. And made the cheyn to be fast∣ned harde at a piller, and with all he gaue him a greate coler of yron a∣boute his necke, wherof the kynge kepte the key himselfe. And whan Mawgis was arraied of this faciō: Charlemaine saide to him. By my soule Mawgis ye shall not escape me now. Sir said Mawis, ye mock well with me. But I tell you nowe before the .xii. peeres of Fraunce that I shall see Mountawban or it be to morowe prime.</P>
<P>WHan Charlemayne vnderstoo∣de this that Mawgys saide to him: he trowed to haue wexed madde all quicke. So he
<PB REF="113"/> stood vp and set hande to hys swerd, and came vnto Mawgys all wrothe for to haue smiten of his heade. But whan Rowland sawe that: he auaū∣sed hym and sayde to the kinge. Syr for God mercy, for yf ye slewe him: we been all shamed for euermore, syr ye ought not to take heed to that he sayth to you. For that, that he sayth he saithe it like a man that is in des∣peyre. And howe might that be that he shoulde escape you as ye hold hym now? Verely my neuewe I wote not how, but y<SUP>t</SUP> he heere afore tyme hathe so often mocked me, maketh me to doubte of him, but at all auenture I shall leaue hym in peace tyll to mo∣rowe that he shall be hanged. Syr sayd Rowlande, ye saye well. Than all they that were there beganne to playe at the tables and at the chesse, and many other games. And whan it came that they had played longe: they began all to haue greate luste to slepe. And whan Mawgis saw that: he made his charme. And whan he hadde made it: they beganne all to fall in a stronge slepe, and Charle∣maine hym selfe slepte so harde, that he fell backewarde vpon hys bed. And whan Mawgys sawe that Charlemayne was so fast a slepe: &amp; all the twelue peeres of Fraunce and all the company of them: he beganne to make a nother charme, that was of suche vertue that his feters that were on his feete, &amp; the coler and the cheyne of yren fell all to the grounde a sundre. And thenne Mawgys rose vpon his feete, and saw Charlemai∣ne that slept so wel grouelynge with his head a wrye, and he tooke then a pelow &amp; righted vp his heade with all. And then he vngirded him and tooke Ioyous his swerde, and gir∣ded about him, and then after he wēt to Rowland and tooke from him du∣randal his good swerde, and after he tooke Hauteclere from Oliuer and Cortyn from Ogier. And after thys: he went to y<SUP>e</SUP> coffres, and tooke there out all the treasour of Charlemayne and went with all this streyght to Mountawban. And whan Mawgis had taken all this: he tooke an herbe and rubbed Charlemaynes nose and his lippes with it, and vnhosed hym and after he shoued him wyth the fynger, and sayde to hym, awake sir emperoure, I promysed you yester ni∣ght that I should not goe wythout I should take my leue of you, farewell I goe now. And whan he had sayde this: he went out of the pauilion, and set him to the way towarde Moun∣tawban. And whan Charlemayne vnderstoode that Mawgys had said to him: he rose vpon hys feete so wrothe that menne could be no more, and called vpon hys twelue peeres that he coulde not awake. And whan he sawe that: he bethought hymselfe an herbe that he had broughte wyth hym from beyonde the greate sea, and tooke it and rubbed withall the nose the mouth and the eien of Row∣lande, and in like wise to all the o∣ther .xii. peeres of Fraūce, and incō∣tinent they were awaked, and rose vpon their feete sore abashed. &amp; whā they were all awaked: they beganne to looke the one vpon the other. And
<PB N="cviii" REF="113"/> the first that began to speke: was the duke Naymes that sayde to the king where is mawgies? By my soule sayd Charlemayne, ye shall delyuer him me agayne, for ye haue let hym goe wilfully, For yf ye wolde haue suffred me to haue hanged him yester¦day: I had be otherwyse ryd of hym. Rowlande said Olyuer, sawe ye him goe hens? Naye by saynt Denys said Rowland. I saw him wel goe saide Charlemaine. Syr said Rowland ye ought thenne to haue tolde vs of it, for he shoulde not haue escaped so. And in saying this: Rowland loketh at his side, and he sawe not durandal his swerde, wherof he did cast a great sighe. And than Charlemayne sayde to him. Neuew where is your swerd? by my head I know well that y<SUP>e</SUP> theef Mawgis hath be wytched vs. For none of vs hath his swerde, and al∣so he hath my hosen with him. Nowe hath he well mocked vs.</P>
<P>ANd whan the .xii. peeres of fraunce saw that thei had lost al their good swerds: they were right sory for it more than any man canne saye. And after Rowland sayde, by my faythe Mawgis hath wonne a great gayne, whan he bereth away thus our swerdes, for they ben more worthe thā is all Paris. And whan Charlemayne perceyued that his co∣fers were open: he went anon &amp; loo∣ked in, &amp; he was sore an angred whā he founde not his Crowne, nor the best parte of hys treasoure, wherof he made great sorow, and after sayd, Ha false theefe Mawgis full litle I haue goten of thee &amp; of thy takynge. And who than had seen the sorowe that the .xii. peeres of Fraunce made: wolde haue had no luste to lawghe.</P>
<P>❧ Nowe shall we tell you a lytell of Mawgys that wente as fast as e∣uer he coulde towarde Mountawban and he came to passe ouer the water of Balācon at that place where Rei∣nawde was full heauy, and full of sorowe, by cause he knew no tydin∣ges of Mawgys, but whan Maw∣gys had passed ouer the water: bay∣arde smelled hym and begane to crye and came toward Mawgys, wolde Reinawde or no. And whan Maw∣gys sawe Reinawde: he knewe hym well, and saide to him lawghinge. Knighte what be ye that rideth at this time of night? and Reinawd said to him ye know wel I am your cosin Reinawd the sonne of Aimon, &amp; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n he lighted from bayard, and came to Mawgis and kyssed him by greate loue many times, and than sayde to hym. Fayre cosin thanked be our lord that I see you delyuered from the hā∣des of Charlemaine. By my faythe saide Mawgis, ye forgate me well behinde. Cosyn saide Reynawd, by my soule I coulde not doe therto. For I haue be heere syth yester day euyn. And I promyse you that I was deli∣bered for to haue succoured you or el∣les to haue dyed with you.

Cosyn sayde Mawgis I haue doon it all wilfully to the end that the king should mar∣ke therby none euil, and that he were not a peched of treason. And than he shewed him al the cause and the ma∣ner that Charlemayn had holde him. Cosin saide Reynawde ye did ryghte well. And whan he had sayde thys: they went on their waye towarde Mountawban, and they mette in their waye Alarde, Guicharde and the lytil Richarde that came ridinge makinge greate mone for doubte of Reinawde. And whan Reinawde sawe theim come: he saide to them, whether goe you my fayre brethern? Sir saide they we went seekinge af∣ter you, ye haue founde me said Rei∣nawde, and I haue founde our cosin Mawgis. And whā they vnderstood this tydinges: they were righte gladde and thanked oure lorde of it. And after Alarde saide to Mawgis Faire cosin where became ye that ye came not with vs again. Alard said Mawgys, whan Richarde was en∣tred within the pauillion of Charle∣main, and had take the egle of golde: I taried in the pauillion for to slea Charlemaine, and it lacked but litill that I slewe him, and whan I trow∣ed to haue comen after you. I founde a greate rowte of knightes, that a∣rested me, and so I defended me of all my power. And than came Oliuer of Vyenne that ouerthrewe me dow∣ne, and I yeelded me to him for his prisoner, the whiche deliuered me to Charlemayne that wolde haue made me to be hanged shamefullye but lorde I thanke you, I haue doon so muche that I am escaped. Cosin said Alarde, it is well happed to you, whan thei had deuised longe ynough: they went to Mountawban, where they made greate feast, whan they were come there: it is not to be asked if the good lady clare was wel glad, For incootinente she did to be made ready diuerse meates for the diner, &amp; whan they hadde eaten: they went to rest, for they were wery and specially Reynawde and Mawgis, wold faine haue slept. And the nexte daie they went to heare their Masse at the chir∣che of Mountawban, and whan the masse was doone: Reinawde called Mawgis his cosin and his brether∣ne, and saide to them. Lordes shewe me the bothie that ye gate yesterdaie. Sir saide Richarde gladlie sith that it please you. And than he tooke the egle that was of golde massi, and of precious stones and gaue it to Rei∣nawde. And whan Reinawde saw that gifte so riche: he was gladde of it by cause of the great valure of it. Rei¦nawd called Mawgis &amp; saide to him Cosin what shall we doo with this egle? My cosin saide Mawgis me se∣meth that ye ought to put hym aboue vpon the apple of the greate towre of this castell to the ende that Charle∣mayne and all his hoste maye see it. By my soule said Reinawdeye, saie wel. And they tooke the egle and ma∣de it to be borne vpon the highe tow∣re of Mountawban. And whan the sonne dyd shyne vpon thys Egle: it
<PB N="cix" REF="114"/> casted so greate a light: that it might be seen .x. myles thence. And whan Charlemaine and his folke apperce∣ued it: they were ryght sorye for it and an angred.</P>
<P>WHan Charlemayne the greate Emperoure saw that the foure sonnes of Aymon mocked him thus: he called to him Rowland and Olyuer, and all the other Peeres of Fraunce and sayde to them. Lordes it is sore mishapped to vs sith we ca∣me in this londe of Gascoygn, for I haue lost my crowne and Ioious my swerde &amp; myn egle of golde that was of so great value as ye all know, and ye al haue loste youre good swerdes, where of we bē wel shamed, &amp; also we haue ben chased fro the feeld shame∣fully. Now haue wel the four sonnes of Aimon shamed vs al through that falce theef Mawgis. Wherfore my faite lordes I complain me vnto you prayinge that you wil helpe me to a∣uenge me vpon theim, for they haue doone you shame as wel as vnto me. Than said the .xii. peeres of Fraūce, syr we be ready for to doo all that ye wyll. I wyll saide the kinge that ye Ogier, also the duke Naymes and ye byshop Turpyn, and ye Escoufe, the sonne of Oedon, that are of the kinred of Reinawde: that ye goe to Mountawban, and so tel to Reinaw∣de, to his brethern and Mawgys that they deliuer me againe my crowne. Ioyous my swerd, and also myne E∣gle of gold, and the swerdes of you al and I shall giue them truce for two yeres. And I shall doo al mine hoste to returne againe in to fraunce, syr answered Ogier. I shal with a good wyll doo your commaundement, but I feare me of Reinawde that he will keep vs prisoners. Ha Ogier, sayde Charlemayne: ye feare him but litell. whan the barons heard the cōmaū∣dement of the king: they made no ta∣rying but lighted on horsbacke, and rode to Mountawban. And whā thei were come togither to the draw brid∣ge: the porter that keept warde vpon the gate, said to them lordes what be ye? my freend said Ogyer, we are of the folke of Charlemaine, goe youre waye to Reinawd, and tell him that the Duke Naymes the byshop Tur∣pin, Escoufe the sonne of Oedon, and Ogier the Dane wolde speake with him. My lordes said y<SUP>t</SUP> porter, I shal goe to him incōtinent, &amp; than he went to Reynawde and shewed him howe foure knightes were at the gate that wolde speake with him, what be they said Reinawde? My lorde said the porter they tolde me that the one is called the duke Naymes, that other the bishop Turpin, and a nother Es∣coufe the sōne of Oedon, &amp; the fourth is named Ogyer the dane. Whan Reynawd heard this: he stood vp and said to his three brethern. My lordes heere cometh foure valyaunt k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ygh∣tes and wise. I beseche you that we shew to them that we been no chil∣dren for to be rocked in a slepe. Cosin sayde Mawgis ye speake well and wisely. Me semeth it were good that we should know, wherfore they co∣me, or they entre, to the ende that we may best answere to them. Than they went vnto the gate, and made the drawe brydge to be lette downe.
<PB REF="115"/> And whan it was doone: Rycharde yssued out first vpon the brydge, and went ayenst them and made to them greate honour and sayd to them. My lordes ye be ryght welcome, thys ca∣stel is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t your commaundement. For I holde me so sure of my brother Rei∣nawd that I dare offre it to you, co∣syn said the messangers gramercye. And than Reinawde auaunced him selfe, and saluted them honourablye, and after tooke Ogier by the hande, &amp; he him, &amp; thother three he brought to the Dungeon, where they were re∣ceiued honestly by the lady Clare the wife of Reinawde. And whan Rei∣nawde had receyued them: he made them to sit vpon a benche, and than he saide to them, fayre lordes I praye you that ye wyll tell vs wherfore ye become? For ye come not without a greate cause, ye knowe wel syr Rey∣nawd said Ogier, that all we that been heere haue euer loued you well. And I promise you yf it had been our will: ye should haue had good peace with the kinge Charlemayne, but many tymes he hathe vnbrayed vs therof, ye must knowe that your co∣syn Mawgis hath shamed vs al, for we were his suretie to Charlemayne vpon our othe to deliuer hym at hys will. And the said Mawgis is come hyther without our leaue ayenst hys promyse, and that worse is: he hath robbed the crowne of the king Char∣lemayne and his swerde, and all the swerdes of vs all .xii. peeres. Where∣fore Charlemain sendeth to you wor∣de by vs that ye see heere, that ye deli∣uer him again his crown, the egle of golde, and all oure swerdes. And he shall gyue you truce for two yeres, and he shall doo returne al his armie in to fraunce. After that Ogyer had said this: Mawgis stood vp and spa∣ke by the leaue of Reynawde, &amp; said, Lordes ye ben right welcome in this castell of Mountawban. And yf it please you, ye shall not speake no mo∣re of this matter now, and ye shall a¦byde this night with vs, and to mo∣rowe ye shal haue an answere of that ye haue sayde. Reynawde saide than Ogier, wyl ye keep that Mawgys hath said? yea without fault said Rei∣nawde, sith that it pleaseth you: we shall abyde for the loue of you. And than Mawgys went to the stuarde of Mountawban, and aduised him the meates. Wherof the knightes of Charlemaine should be feasted with all, and tolde that they should be wel serued, what so euer it coste. And see that the great cup be borne afore the duke Naymes, the whiche I did con∣quere at reyns. My lorde answered the stuarde, doubte not, ye shall well be serued at my power. And the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e Mawgys came agayne. And whan Reynawde sawe him come: he calles hym and saide to him, my cosyn I praye you see that we be well serued, sir saide Mawgis, I haue purueyed for it al ready. Whā Reinawd vnder∣stood him: he was gladde of it, and begā to deuise with y<SUP>e</SUP> folke of Char∣lemaine right honestly and of many thinges. And whan he thought that the meate myght be well ready: he &amp; his bretherne tooke the foure knigh¦tes and brought them to the halle to theyr meate, &amp; whan they were there: Mawgys made them washe, &amp; than
<PB N="cx" REF="115"/> he tooke the duke Naimes and made hym syt downe, and my lady Clare next hym. And he made syt downe y<SUP>e</SUP> bisshop Turpyn and Reynawde and than Ogyer and Alarde, and after Guicharde and Escoufe the sonne of Oedon, and than the lytle Rychard. And whan they were all set at the ta¦ble, the meates of y<SUP>e</SUP> first course were brought to the borde, &amp; thā the other one after another by good ordenaū∣ce and fayre. And to say the trouthe they were well and honourablye ser∣ued, and of many and dyuerse serui∣ses of royall meates. And after that they had well eaten at theyr ease: the duke Naymes called Reynawd and sayd to him. Good cosin I pray you that ye wyl delyber your selfe for to gyue vs a good answere of y<SUP>t</SUP> ye haue heard of vs. Lordes sayd Reynawde I shall doo it in so muche that the kyng shall haue a cause to be contēte of me. For I shall doo all that he wyll for to haue peace and hys loue withall, and that for the loue of the other my lordes y<SUP>t</SUP> be heere now. And than Reynawde made to bryng the swerde of Charlemayne &amp; the swer∣des of y<SUP>e</SUP> twelue peeres, and also the crowne and the Egle of golde. And whan Ogyer sawe this: he began to laughe and sayd. By my soule Rey∣nawde ye had heere a fayre gayne yf ye had kept it. And whan Rycharde saw that his brother wolde delyuer the Egle of golde: he began for to say By saynt poule my fayre brother ye shall not doo so. Ye shall not delyuer agayne that I haue wonne wel and truly by force of armes, brother Ri∣charde sayde Reynawde, let me doo I pray you. I will not sayd Richard by my soule, for Charlemayne hym∣selfe smote me whyle that I was prysoner within his pauilion full shāefully wyth a staffe. Lordes said the duke Naymes, let thys a lone. And take we that Reynawde giueth to vs in thanke, for he hath doone y∣nough, By my fayth sayd y<SUP>e</SUP> bysshop Turpyn he dooth so. And than they tooke the crowne of Charlemayne &amp; all theyr swerdes. And whan thei had them: Ogyer sayd to Reynawde. My cosyn I counsell you that ye come w<SUP>t</SUP> vs, and Alarde &amp; Guycharde shal abyde heere to keep your castell, Syr sayd Reynawde I feare me to sore y<SUP>e</SUP> kynge wolde make me for to be kil∣led outrageously. Come on hardely sayd the duke Naymes, for we shall lede you wel surely. For syth that ye shalbe with vs: ye ought not to fear nothyng. Lordes sayde than Rey∣nawde I shall doo your commaun∣demente vnder your assurynge.</P>
<P>WHan Reynawde was accor∣ded for to go wyth the Duke Naimes, and with the bisshop Tur∣pyn, wyth Ogyer the dane and Es∣coufe the sonne of Oedon: they lygh∣ted all vpon theyr horses, and Rey∣nawde mounted vpon bayarde and armed hym. And in like wise dyd A∣larde. And whan the duchesse Clare saw that Reynawde her Lorde wolde go with the folke of the Emperour Charlemayne: she came before them &amp; kneeled downe before them, and sayd vnto them my lordes, I thanke you muche of the fauour that ye did
<PB REF="116"/> shew to my brother Richarde and to Mawgis, now agayne I pray you that ye will haue Reynawde for re∣cōmended mi lorde and my deere hus¦bande the whiche ye lede with you. Madame said Ogier, haue no doubt that Reynawde shall haue anie har∣me. For wee should not suffre it for nothing for to leese both life &amp; good∣des. And than they put them to the way for to goe thens, and Reinawd tooke ten knyghtes wyth him for to beare hym felawship. whan they were come to the riuer of Balancō: they sought after y<SUP>e</SUP> passage and pas∣sed ouer. And whan they were all ouer: Ogier began for to sai. Lordes ye wot well all is of euyll courage agaynst Reynawd, wherfore I doubt me of him y<SUP>t</SUP> we haue brought heere wyth vs. I counsell that we knowe fyrst the wyll of charlemayne or euer he see Reynawd, Ogier sayd the duke Naymes, ye speake well and wisely we shal go speake ye and I to Char∣lemaine, and Reynawde shall abyde heere tyll we come agayne. Lordes sayd than Reynawde I shal doo that ye counsel me, but I pray you holde me that ye haue promised me, that is that ye shall keep my bodye and my lymmes from harme. Reynawde sayd the duke Naymes. we shall ra∣ther dye, than that ye should haue a∣ny harme. And than he and Ogyer tooke the way towarde the hoste of Charlemayne, and Reinawde abode with the bysshop Turpyn and wyth the sonne of Oedon. Now herken of Pynabell a spye that longed vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> kynge Charlemayne, wyt it that the spye was at the riuer side of Balan∣con with this felawship. whan the wordes afore sayde were spoken, whan the spye had well vnderstand all the conclucion: he stale hymselfe fro the companye and rode a good pace as he myght in the worlde and came to Charlemayne, to whome he sayd in this maner, syr I bryng you tidinges wherof ye shalbe ryght glad my freende sayd Charlemayne thou art well come. I praye you tell me what tidinges ye brynge? wyt it syr that I haue left Reynawde and Alarde hys brother at the ryuer side of Balancon with the bisshop Tur∣pyn and Escouf the Sonne of Oe∣don, and the duke Naymes, and O∣gyer are coming towarde you for to aske leue yf they shall brynge them to you wyth sureti. Is it trouth said Charlemaine? yea without faut said Pinable. By my soule sayd the king I shall rewarde thee for it ryght well, but keep well that ye shew not this to no man vpon thy life, for I shall put therto a good remedy. And than he behelde aboute hym and saw Oliuer and sayde, Olyuer inconty∣nent and without any desaye, take two hundred knyghtes with horses and wel armed, and lede them at the ryuer syde of Balancon, where yee shall fynde Reynawde and Alarde, &amp; see that ye take them &amp; bring them hither, and if ye doo this: aske of me what ye wyll, &amp; ye shall haue it. And than sayd Oliuer, syr I shal wel doo your commaundemente. And than he tooke wyth him two hūdred kni∣ghtes as y<SUP>e</SUP> kinge Charlemayne had ordeyned hī, &amp; tooke his way towar∣de the ryuer of Balancon. Now god
<PB N="Cxi" REF="116"/> through his pitie saue the good kni∣ght Reynawde and Alarde his deere brother, for they ben in great peril of theyr lyues. This hangyng that O∣lyuer was gone towarde the ryuer of Balancon: the duke Naymes and Ogyer came to the hoste and lighted a fore the pauilion of the kinge, and went in. And whan they sawe the kyng: they made him the reuerence, but he sayd no worde to them. whā Ogier saw the countenaunce of the king: he sayd to hym. Syr what sē∣blaunt is this that ye shewe to vs? I meruayle me greatli that ye make vs so euyll cheere seen that we come fro thens where ye haue sende vs, y<SUP>t</SUP> was to Moūtawbā, where we haue spoken with Reynawde the sonne of Aymon, the whiche is al togither re∣dy for to doo al that your pleasur is, and so he hath delyuered vs agayne your crowne and al our swerdes, as for your egle: ye shal haue it whā ye wyll. Ogyer sayd than Charlemain what haue ye doone of Reynawde for I am sure that ye haue brought him wyth you? Syr sayd Ogier it is trouth verely we haue brought him w<SUP>t</SUP> vs vpō our faith for to take sure∣ties of you of truce y<SUP>t</SUP> ye haue graun∣ted hym. By saynt Denis (sayd char¦lemayne) I will not therof, for yf I can haue hym ones in my handes: al the golde in the worlde shal not saue him but I shal make him dy a sham∣full death. Syr sayde Ogyer what say ye? I meruel me greatly of that ye haue sayd. Damp emperour said than the duke Naymes, so greate a kynge as ye be: ought neuer to haue sayd suche wordes as ye now haue vttred with your mouth for the va∣lue of halfe his realme, ha goddes sweete sir giue not to your selfe so great a blame, &amp; yf ye doo this that ye say: I promise you that I, Ogier, the bisshop Turpin and the sonne of Oedon, we shall yeelde you euyll for euill, &amp; yet wee shall saue Reynawde at our power so that ye shal not doo him harme, sith that we haue brou∣ght hym vpon our fayth. Now shal we se sayd Charlemayne how ye shal conne helpe him. Syr (sayde Ogyer) yf ye doo to vs any outrage or dys∣honour: I promise you wee shal for∣sake the homage and the fayth that we owe to you, and we shall doo the worste that we can agaynst you and agaynst your realme. ¶ we shal now presently speake a litle of Oliuer y<SUP>t</SUP> was gone to Balancon. It happed as by fortune that the sayde Oliuer ouertooke Reynawde so nigh y<SUP>e</SUP> whi∣che was on foote: that he coulde not haue leyser for to moūt vpō bayard. And whan Reynawde sawe that he might not light vpon his horse by∣cause that Oliuer had ouertaken him so sore: he was sore an angred of it that almoste he waxed mad al qui∣cke. And than he returned him to∣warde the bisshop Turpyn and to∣warde Escoufe &amp; sayd to them, Vas∣sailes ye haue betraied me falsli and I wolde neuer beleue it, wherin ye haue doone greate sinne and great euil. Syr sayd the bisshop Turpyn, I swere to you vpon my fayth that herof we neuer knew nothinge nor thought it, and I promyse you that we shall liue and dye with you, and w<SUP>t</SUP> this: Reynawde turned towarde
<PB REF="117"/> Oliuer &amp; sayd to him Oliuer may ye yeelde me againe the goodnes that I shewed to you in the playne of Val-colours, I know that one curteysie requireth another, for whan ye were to the ground cast, I deliuerde you your horse againe, and holpe you to light vpon hym agayne, syr sayd O∣liuer it is trouth that ye say, and I promise you that I am ryght sorye that I haue founde you now heere. For I know no man in the worlde that wolde doo to you anye harme, but I wolde be wroth with him, this hanging that Reynawde and Oly∣uer spake together: there came Row∣lande that was departed from thost after Oliuer for to help hym to take Reynawde, and whan he was night he began to crye. Ha ha Reynawde, by my soule ye be nowe taken and be trapped. And whan he had sayd this there was Ogier behinde him y<SUP>t</SUP> had folowed hym with the poynt of the spere, the which sayde to hym, by my head syr Rowlande ye shall doo no harme to Reynawde, For the Duke Naymes and I haue brought hym hether vpon our fayth, for to take y<SUP>e</SUP> sureties of the trewes that we haue gyuen to him in the kinges behalfe as ye know he had charged vs to do And I tell you Syr Rowland yf ye doo to him any harme: ye shal doo it to vs. Ogier sayd Rowland ye shall now be an euil suretie for him. Row∣land sayde Ogier, I make myne a∣vowe to you y<SUP>t</SUP> yf ye saut Reynawd: we foure that ben heere shall helpe hym agaynst you. Rowlande sayde than Oliuer I praye you that ye let Reynawde in peace, for I promyse you he did ones to me a curteyse tur∣ne, and a great pleasur, &amp; now I wil rewarde him for it, if it please you, and I shall tell you what wee shall doo. we shall lede Reynawde before Charlemayne. And wee shall praye hym that he treat hym curteisly, and we shall parforce our selfe to make his appoyntment. Lordes sayde the Duke Names, Oliuer hath spoken honestly. I counsell that wee leade Reinawde tofore Charlemaine, for to see what he wil doo of him. And I swere by god yf he wyll doo any out∣rage to Reinawde: we shall not suf∣fre it for to dye for it, &amp; we shall help him to saue him selfe to our power. After all these wordes: they tooke them selfe on theyr waye, for to lede Reynawde to Charlemayne.</P>
<P>WHan Rowland and Oly∣uer had brought Reynaw¦de into the pauylyon of y<SUP>e</SUP> kynge Charlemaine: wyt it that the duke Naymes, y<SUP>e</SUP> bysshop Turpin, Ogyer the dane, also Escouf the sōn of Oedon wente neuer one foote frō Reynawd. But whan Oliuer wold haue presented Reynawde to Char∣lemayne: Ogier auaunced hymselfe and sayd to the kyng in this maner. Syr ye knowe howe yee dyd sende vs foure that ben heere afore you in your message to Mountawban, for to tell vnto Reynawde as yee had charged vs, to whome wee dyd shew in your behalfe, that yf he wolde delyuer to you agayne your Crow∣ne, and all the good sweardes that Mawgys had borne with hym, and
<PB N="cxii" REF="117"/> the Egle of golde, ye should giue him touce for two yeres, &amp; that ye should doo turne your hoste into Fraunce a¦gayne. wyt that Reynawde hath do∣one all that we haue required hym of in your behalfe, &amp; wee haue brou∣ght him with vs vnder your saufe conduyte, and so we take hym vnder our charge that he should haue no more harme thā we should. Notwith¦standynge ye haue made hym to be taken, the whyche thynge we wolde neuer haue thought that yee wolde haue doone it, seen that heere bē your crowne &amp; your swerdes, &amp; the Egle of golde is at your pleasure whan ye will haue it. And moreouer wee promysed hym that yf ye dyd to hym anye harme: that ye should doo it to vs as well as to hym, &amp; I promise you yf ye doo to him any harme, yee shalbe greatly blamed for it of al the worlde. But and yf ye wil werke ho∣nestly heere in and lyke a true empe∣roure &amp; king for to keep that neyther ye nor we be not blamed for it: sende Reynawde agayne to Mountawbā, with this that he hath taken to vs, &amp; whan he shall be therin agayne: do to hym the worste that ye can.</P>
<P>OGyer sayde Charlemayne, ye speake for nought &amp; all youre felowes also. For I shall not doo so but I shal doo after myne owne wil thoughe ye all had sworne the con∣trary. And so shal I not doo of Rey∣nawde as I dyd of y<SUP>e</SUP> false theef maw¦gis. And whan Charlemayne hadde sayde thus: he turned him towarde Reynawde, &amp; sayd to him. Reynawd Reynawde I holde you nowe, cer∣tes I shall so keep you that ye shall not deceyue me as did Mawgys, for I shall make you anon to be smyttē and cutte in small peeces, and than brente all to powder. Syr sayd Rey∣nawde ye shal not doo so &amp; god wil. Ogyer sayde Charlemaine, wyll ye defende agaynst me my mortall ene¦mye? Syr sayde Ogier I wil not de∣fend your enemyes against you: but I promise you that I shall defende my trouth agaynst all men. Sir said than Reynawde what is your plea∣sure y<SUP>t</SUP> I doo? ye haue called me tray∣tour, wyt it that I was neuer such nor no mā of my lyuage. nor I know not in the worlde that sayth that I haue be a traytour, or y<SUP>t</SUP> I haue doon any treason agaynst you, out that I should fight in the quarell agaynste him body to body. By my fayth said Charlemayne, I shall make it to be proued vpon you by force of armes Syr sayd Reynawde, ye speake now as a kynge, &amp; heere is my gage that I giue, sayinge that I am as true a man as any that is in all the worlde &amp; in lyke wise all they of my linage. Than Charlemayne sayde to him, if ye gyue me sureties: wyt that I shal take vp your gage, and not els. Syr sayd reynawde I shall fynde suretie ynoughe. Than he turned him &amp; saw Ogyer, and sayd to him. Syr Ogyer come forthe, &amp; ye duke Naymes, and also y<SUP>e</SUP> bosshop Turpyn &amp; ye Escouf the sonne of Oedon, be my suretie I I pray you, for ye ought to be so, ye knowe that I dyd neuer vntruthe Reynawde sayde the duke Naymes we shall be suretie for you wyth a good wyll.</P>
<PB REF="118"/>
<P>THan sayde Reynawde, syr heere ben my sureties that I take you, are ye contente of thē? yea sayd Charlemayne I aske no more. Syr sayd than Reynawde, who is he y<SUP>t</SUP> shall make the batayle? By my fayth sayde Charlemayne, my selfe shal it be. Syr sayde Rowland, yee shal not doo so &amp; it please you, for I shal fyght for you my selfe. Syr said Reynawde ordeyn in your place su∣che as it shall please you, and whan he had sayd this worde: bayard was taken agayne to Reinawde, y<SUP>e</SUP> whych lighted vpon &amp; went towarde moun∣tawban, and with him went Ogyer the dane, the duke Naymes &amp; escouf the sonne of Oedon, and togither a∣lard that had betaken as Reynawd. And whā they were come nigh moū¦tawban: Guycharde, Richarde and Mawgys sawe them come, &amp; came theym agaynst, and whan Rycharde sawe Reynawde: he asked of hym howe he had doone? By my faythe sayd Reynawde we are not welcom for the kynge knew that we were at Balancon where Ogyer had left vs and he sent anon Olyuer &amp; Rowlād for to take vs, and were ouertaken so sodenly that we coulde not lyght vpon our horses, &amp; we were brought to Charlemayne, and I promyse you he is a cruell man fulfylled w<SUP>t</SUP> all cursednes.

<P>By God Reynawde this daye shall ye haue a doo with me, &amp; I promise you that whan ye shall goe fro the feeld: ye shal neuer doo faytes of ar∣mes agaynst me nor agaynste no o∣ther. whan Reinawde heard Row∣land crye so: he came agaynst him &amp; sayd to him, syr Rowlād it becometh not to suche a knyght as ye be for to threte me thus, &amp; I tell you y<SUP>t</SUP> I am heere redye, &amp; yf ye wyl batayle: ye shall haue it incontynent.

And whan Reynawde saw him come▪ he went right fyersly vpon Rowlande, &amp; than began the batayle to be harde, and fore cruel be¦twene them two, and I promise you they lefte not one peece of theyr har∣nes

And whā they had made theyr prayers: oure Lorde for y<SUP>e</SUP> prayers of Charlemain shewed a fayre myracle, for he made ryse so great a clowde &amp; so thike, that they myght not see eche other. Than Rowland sayd to Reinawde, where are ye gone Reinawde, other it is ni∣ght, or els I cānot see neuer a whit? No more doo I sayd Reynawde ve∣rely. Reynawde sayd Rowlande, I pray you doo to me a curteys turne, &amp; a nother tyme I shal doo as much for you yf ye require me therof. Syr Rowland (sayd Reynawde) I am re∣dy for to doo al that ye wyll require me of, so that my honour be saued.</P>
<P>Gramercye Reynawde of that ye haue graunted me. wyt that y<SUP>e</SUP> thing that I wyll desyre of you is this, y<SUP>t</SUP> ye bring me with you to Mountaw∣ban. Syr Rowland sayd Reynawde yf ye wyll doo this: I shal be ryght glad therof. By my fayth I shal go there wyth you without any faute if it please you. Syr sayde Reynawde God of hys goodnes yeelde you the worshyp that ye wil now doo to me for I haue not deserued it vnto you. Syr Reynawde (sayde Rowlande) wyt that I doo this bycause that I know wel that ye be in the right, and that ye fyght in a good quarell, and I am in the wronge. And whā row∣lande had sayd this the receyued hys syght, and saw as he dyd afore, and than he sawe Vylaunche his good horse, and he lyghted vpon hym, and in lyke wyse Reynawde vpon bay∣arde And whan Charlemayne sawe this: he was sore abasshed, and begā to call and to crye. Lordes Lordes nowe see, I wot not what I should saye, for Reynawde ledeth Rowlād with hym. Now shall I see if ye shal let him goe. whan Charlemayn had spoken thus: he came to his horse &amp; lyghted vpon him, and began to crie Now shall I know who ben my frē∣des. whan the barons of Fraunce heard Charlemaine speake thus: thei spurred theyr horses and ran after Reynawde.</P>
<P>WHan Ogier sawe Reynawde come wyth Rowlande that he brought w<SUP>t</SUP> hym: he was ryght glad, and he came agaynst Reynawd and sayd to him. Syr ye haue wel wrou∣ght this dai, that ye haue taken such a proye. Ogier sayd Reynawde, I promise you that Rowlande hath let himselfe to be taken with his good wyll. Thanked be god of it sayde the duke Names Reynawde said Ogier go your way to Mountawban, and the bysshop Turpin y<SUP>e</SUP> sonne of Oe∣dō and I: shal returne agayne, &amp; we shal tary Charlemayne that cometh after you and wee shal doo so much that ye shall be wel at Mountawbā or they ouer take you. Ogier sayde Rowland ye say well, and I thanke you of your curtoysie. whā thei had thus shortlye spoken together: Rey∣nawde &amp; Rowlande rode so fast that they came to moūtawban. It is not to be asked if Rowland was wel fea∣sted at moūtawban. I promise you it is not possible to feast a prince better nor more honourablie thā he was at moūtawban. This hanging: Ogier was come against king Charlemain
<PB N="cxv" REF="120"/> and he dyd so muche by his fayre lā¦guage that he helde the king till that he thought that Reynawde &amp; Row∣lande might be well at Mountawbā by that time. And whā he had doone so: he spurred his horse and went to Mountawbā after the other. where as he myght well goe without to be vnbraied for it, for he was one of the suretyes of Reynawde as yee haue heard. And whan Charlemaine saw this: he folowed him vnto the gates And whan he was come to the gate of Mountawban: he began to crye with an hie voyce. By god Reynawde this that ye haue doone: shall auayle you litle, for ye shall neuer haue pea∣ce wyth me as longe as I am man a liue. And whan that he had sayd this he returned him from the gate, and sayd to Oliuer that was there with hym. Oliuer go lightlye to Mount∣bendell, and bring heere all my hoste for I wyll besiege all thys Castell. Than sayd Oliuer I shall go there with a good wyll, but and it please you ye shall come wyth me, for I promise you if ye comnot there your selfe: they shall not come hither for me. Than shall I goe there my self, and thus tooke Charlemayne hys waye towarde Mountbendel where his hoste laye, whan his folke sawe him come: they wente agaynst hym and began to saye to him, syr what haue ye doone with Rowlād? lordes sayd Charlemayne Rowlād is gone to Mountawban, but I commaund you al that incontinent without de∣laye that my siege be transported all rounde aboute Moūtawban, and ye damp Oliuer shall beare the oriflā and damp Rychard of Normandye shall lede our hoste. Whan Charle∣mayne had comaūded all this: there was none that sayde agaynst it, but set themself to bring downe the ten∣tes and pauilion, and to trusse and lede theyr baggages, and caryed all to Mountawban.</P>
<P>RYcharde of Normandy went with .xii. thousande men to Balācon, to keep the passage of the ryuer tyll all the hoste were ouer the ryuer. This hanging: Charlemayne had put himself afore for to se where he might best pitche his tentes, and his pauilion, for to keep siege royall afore the Castell of Mountawban.</P>
<P>And whan al the hoste was come a fore Mountawban: the kinge made incontinēt his pauilion to be set vp before the great gate. And whan all the hoste was set: the nyght watche of the great Towre came to Maw∣gys, and sayde vnto him. Syr wyt y<SUP>e</SUP> Charlemaine is come with his hoste and hath put his pauilion before the mayster gate. Is it true sayd Maw∣gis? yea without any faute sayd the watche. Now care not for it sayde Mawgis, for Charlemayne seeketh his domage, and he shall haue it so∣ner than he weeneth. Than went Mawgys to Reynawde. And she∣wed him howe Charlemayne was come with all his hoste. And whan Reynawde heard this: he went vnto Rowland and sayd vnto him. Sir ye muste wyt that Charlemane youre vnkle hath layde siege afore vs, but I promise you that if it were not for the loue of you: I should shew him
<PB REF="121"/> y<SUP>t</SUP> he hath not doone wel. Reynawde (sayd Rowlande) I thanke you mu∣che, but one thynge I wyll tell you, saue your correccion, me semeth that I ought to sende to myne vnkle the duke Naymes, Ogyer the dane, and also the bysshop Turpyn that shall shewe vnto him in this maner, Syr Emperour wyt that Reynawde for the loue of you wyll not gyue no I∣rons to your neuew, nor he wyl not put hym in prison. But he maketh him as good cheere as he doth to his owne selfe. And that more is, Rey∣nawde, his brethern and Mawgys doo present themselfe for to giue thē and theyr castell vnto your handes, so that theyr liues be saued. ye spea∣ke well and wisely syr Rowland said Reynawde, and so I am redy to doo as ye wyll haue it. Rowland sayde the duke Naymes, I dare not goe to hym, ye may wel ynoughe sayd Row¦land. For ye be not hated of the king duke Naymes sayd Ogyer, we shal goe to Charlemayne, yf ye wyll doo after me. And they accorded that thei two should goe togither to the kyng for to shew to hym as Rowland had deuised. And whan that these two princes, the duke Naymes and O∣gyer came to the pauilion of Charle∣mayne: they saluted him reuerently, and the duke Naymes spake to him in thys maner of wyse. Syr Empe∣rour your neuew Rowland recom∣mendeth him humblye to your good grace, the whych Reynawde kepeth within Mountawban for his priso∣ner, not vnkyndly: but he maketh to hym as good there and as great ho∣nour he bereth vnto hym as he were his owne brother, and his souerayn lorde, and all this he dooth for your loue. And demaundeth of you peace yf it please you to graunt it to hym by suche maner that he shall gyue you Mountawban, and the Egle of golde, and he shall let goe Rowlande at his libertie without raunsū. And also he shall yeelde hymselfe to you and his brethern in lyke wyse, and also Mawgys for to doo your wyl with them, saue theyr liues: and they shall promyse you yf theyr seruyse pleaseth you, that thei shal serue you agaynst all mē with all theyr power and puissaunce, so that ye shall haue cause to thanke them for it.</P>
<P>WHā Charlemayne vnderstood these wordes: he shooke al for great angre. And began to saye to y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Naymes, and to the other that were come to hym, flee out of my pa¦uilion euill folke. I meruayle me how haue ye durst cum heere within and I tell you that Reynawde shall haue no peace with me, but if I haue Mawgis for to doo my wyll of him. whan the barons vnderstode char∣lemayne that spake thus: they came out of hys Pauilion and tooke no leaue at hym, but returned inconti∣nent to Mountawban. whan they were come there: Rowland and Rei∣nawde asked theym howe they had doone w<SUP>t</SUP> Charlemaine? Lordes said the duke Naimes, it is no force to be asked after it. For Charlemayn wyl not doo it, but if men take vnto him Mawgis for to doo his will of him, Lordes sayd Reynawde I am sorye for it. I meruayle how Charlemayn
<PB N="cxvi" REF="121"/> is so harde harted, and I make mine a vowe vnto god, he shall not haue Mawgys though I should dye for it. After these wordes: they went to theyr meat, &amp; Mawgis made theym to be serued plēteously and worship∣fully, and whan they had supped: the beddes were heled, and they wente anon to bed. And whan Reynawde wolde go to his bed: he called to hym Mawgis, and sayd to hym, cosyn I pray you that ye doo make good wat¦che to night. For ye know that oure liues lieth therupon. Syr sayd maw¦gis feare not for to slepe well &amp; rest your selfe. For I promyse you y<SUP>u</SUP> thys castell shalbe well kepte by goddes grace, &amp; whan all the barons were a bed: Mawgis wente to the stable and sadled Bayarde, and than he li∣ghted vpon hym and he came to the gate and sayd to the porter. My frēd open the gate for I must go out a li∣tle, &amp; abyde me heere for I shal come agayne soone. Syr sayd the porter. I shall doo so with a good wil. Thā wente out Mawgys streyght to the pauilion of Charlemayne. And whā he was come there: he began for to make hys charme, &amp; brought a slepe all they that were in the hoste. And whan he had doone so: he wente to the bed of Charlemayne, and tooke hym in his armes and brought him vpon Bayarde. And whan he had doone so: he wente his wayes agayn to Moūtawban, and brought Char∣lemayne with him. And whan he was come there agayne: he tooke Charlemayne from Bayarde, and bare him into his chambre and layde hym in his bed. Whan all this was thus doone: He tooke a torche &amp; fired it, and pytched it bytwene the strawe &amp; the bedsted, so that it helde fast euin before the visage of the kinge Char∣lemayne. And after he wente to the chambre of Reynawde and sayde to hym, Cosin what wolde ye wel giue that should deliuer Charlemayne in∣to your handes? By my soule sayde Reynawde I haue nothyng but that I should gladly giue it so y<SUP>t</SUP> I might haue him heere within this castell of Moūtawban. Cosyn sayd Mawgis wil ye promyse me that ye shall doo to him no harme of his body, nother your brethern nor none of yours? &amp; I shall put him into your handes e∣uen anon. Cosyn sayd Reynawde, I promyse you that vpon my faythe, now come with me sayd Mawgys. And than Mawgys brought Rey∣nawde into his chambre, and shewed him Charlemayne that was in hys bed and slepte, and after he sayde to him. My cosyn Reynawde. Now ye haue heere Charlemayne, keep him so well that he scape not you. And whan Mawgis had deliuered Char¦lemayne to Reynawde, he came vn∣to y<SUP>e</SUP> stable where he had put bayarde and tooke some strawe and rubbed his backe with all &amp; his head, &amp; than he kissed him al weeping, and tooke leaue of him. And after he went and tooke the palstar and the cloke and came vnto the porter, and gaue him all his other raymentes, that he had wered afore and went out of Moun∣tawban. ¶ Now leaueth the history to speke of Reynawde, and of Char∣lemayne a lytle, and shall shewe of Mawgys that left all his kinred &amp;

Brother ye haue spoken wi∣selye, but ye see that we cannot haue peace wyth Charlemayne by no wi∣se me semeth that wee ought to aske it of hym oute for all, and yf he wil not: let vs keep hym prysoner, bro∣ther sayd Guycharde ye say wel, but my hert telleth me that he shall neuer make peace wyth vs nor loue vs, Lordes sayde Rycharde me semeth that wee haue a good head of Rey∣nawde our brother, thanked be our Lorde, the whyche hath gouerned vs ryght well herto, let hym shyfte wyth the kynge as he wyll. And that that he wil: shall be doone. By my faythe sayde Alarde, Rycharde speaketh well. And whan they were all accorded to that that Reynawde should doo: the foure brethern went to the Chambre where Rowlande was, to whome Reynawde spake in thys wyse. Syr Rowlande a ryse I praye you that ye wyll sende for O∣gier, the bysshop Turpyn and for all the other that be heere wythin of the folke of Charlemayne. For I wyll tell you one thynge. And whā Row∣lande saw Reynawde and hys bre∣thern at that time of the night come into his chambre: he was meruayl∣led. Neuerthelesse he sent for all hys felawes, as Reynawde hadde tolde hym. And whan they were al come: Reynawde stoode vp and sayd. Lor∣des ye ben all my freendes, god gra∣mercy and you, wherof I wyll not hyde nothynge from you. Yee must know y<SUP>t</SUP> I haue heere within a pry∣soner by whome I shal haue peace &amp; all myne herytaunce agayne. Rey∣nawde sayd Rowlād, I pray you tel me what he his. For heere is no mā, but that wolde fayne ye should doo wel. By my soule sayd Reynawde it is the great emperour Charlemayn
<PB N="cxviii" REF="123"/> to whome al fraūce belongeth. And whan Rowland vnderstode these ti∣dinges: he was sore maruayled of it &amp; sayd. Reynawde ye tell me nowe a wunderfull thynge, Howe haue ye taken myne vncle so lyghtly? tell me &amp; it please you, how ye had him heere within? haue ye taken hym by force of armes? nay verely said Reynawd Tell me then how I pray you sayd Rowlande? wit it sayde Reynawde that I wot not howe Mawgys my cosyn did to night, but well I wot y<SUP>t</SUP> he hath brought the king heere with∣in out of his pauilion, and hath laide him in a bed, in a chambre where he is now fast a slepe.</P>
<P>WHan Rowland and al his felawes heard these tidin∣ges: they were greatly a∣basshed, how it myght be that maw∣his should bringe the kynge there. I meruayle much ther of sayd the duke Naymes, for ye knowe well that the king made hymselfe for to be kepte bothe night and day well sure. Lor∣des sayde than Ogyer, all this hath doone our Lorde for the loue of rey∣nawde, bycause he setteth hym al to mischeif against Reynawde and that the warre hath lasted to longe y<SUP>e</SUP> whi∣che shal now be left, wherof I thāke God for my parte. For manye good knightes haue loste their lyues for it. And whan Ogier had sayd thus: Reynawde tooke Rowland and the other, and brought theym alwayes speakinge vnto the chambre, where Charlemayne laye so faste a slepe, that they coulde not awake hym, for nothing that they could doo to him, For Mawgys had charmed hym so harde. And whan the barons sawe y<SUP>e</SUP> kinge so harde a slepe: they wundred full sore vpon it, &amp; they were great∣ly abasshed of it. Than spake Row∣lād fyrst and sayde Reynawde where is Mawgis that hath wrought so well to night. I praye you let hym come heere, and that he awake mine vncle Charlemaine out of this slepe And whan he shall be awaked: wee shall all fall at hys feete, and shall crye hym mercy. And so I pray you that thoughe yf ye holde mine vncle in your handes, that ye wyll not be the prouder for it in youre wordes, by my fayth syr Rowland sayd Rey∣nawde. I wil that ye know I should rather dye than I should say so my souerayne lorde a foule worde. But I shall put me, my goodes, and all my brethern to his wyll, to the ende that it wyl please hym to graunt vs peace wyth him. And I wyll go fet∣che Mawgys to you, therto doo with hym what ye wyll. And than Rey∣nawde wente and sought Mawgys the whiche he coulde not finde, wher of he was full sory. And whan that the porter wyst that Reynawde sou∣ght after Mawgys: he came to hym and sayd. Syr ye seeke hym for nou∣ght, for he wente his wayes out ri∣ght now. And how knowest thou of it sayd Reynawde? Syr wyt it that this night he made me open the gate and he wēt out vpō your horse bay∣arde. And he had not taryed longe: whan he brought a great man a big¦ge vpon the horse necke afore hym, &amp; went in I wot not where. And soone after he came agayne vpon another
<PB REF="124"/> horse, and he had clothed hym selfe poorely. And than he made me to o∣pen the gate, and he wente oute, and he came not sith againe. And al this is trouth that I tell you now.</P>
<P>ANd whan Reynawde had vnderstande these wordes he was so wrothe y<SUP>t</SUP> he wist not what to say nor doo. For he knewe well by hymself that Mawgys was gon his wayes bycause he wolde no len∣ger abyde the wrathe of Charle∣mayne. Than began Reynawde for to weepe full tenderly for hys cosin that was thus gone. And all wee∣pynge he came againe vnto the bar∣ons, and sayde to them how Maw∣gys was gone away wythout his knowledge wher of he was so worth and so sori that he went almoste out of his minde. And whā Alarde, Guy¦charde, and Rycharde had well vn∣derstāde thys: they begā for to make great moue, and sorowed full sore. And than Richarde began for to sai, Ha my fayre cosyn Mawgys what shall we doo from hens forthon? sith that we haue loste you: we may wel say y<SUP>t</SUP> we be discomfited. For ye were our saluacyon, our succours, &amp; oure hope, our counsel, our refute, our de∣fence, and also our guyde. For it is not yet longe ago that I should haue dyed an euyll death yf I had not bē succoured through your helpe. Alas all the heuynes y<SUP>t</SUP> ye bere of the wra∣the y<SUP>t</SUP> the kinge Charlemayne hath agaynst you cometh onli by vs. And whan he had sayd so: he knacked his teeth for angre, and sayde. wee ben nowe well all lost syth that we haue lost Mawgis. And with this: he set hande to his swearde, &amp; wolde haue slayne the Emperour Charlemayne but Reynawde drew him a syde. And the duke Naymes and Ogyer sayde than vnto hym. Rycharde Richarde refrayne your courage. For it were not wel doone for to kyll a man that slepeth. And also afore that we shal departe hence: we shall set all at one and God wyll. ¶ Shortelye for to speake: Olyuer and the Duke Nay∣mes spake so fayre vnto Rycharde y<SUP>t</SUP> they made him promise them that he should doo no harme to the Kynge Charlemayne. Neuerthelesse Ry∣charde left not to make great sorow for his cosyn Mawgys that he had lost. For al them y<SUP>t</SUP> saw him make so great mone had pitie for to se him. It was no meruayle if Richarde made sorowe for Mawgis: For I promise you he had greate need of hym not longe after. And so had all his bre∣thern, as ye shall heare heere after.</P>
<P>ALl thus as the foure sonnes of Aymon made theyr moue for the loue of theyr cosin Mawgis: The duke Nymes began to speake &amp; sayde in this wise. By god, lordes ye doo not wel for to make so great sorowe. I pray you leue this heuy∣nes. And let vs begyn to speake of your peace that muste be made with the Emperour Charlemayn that an ende maye be hadde of thys warre, that hath endured so longe. By god sayd Rowlande ye be passynge slow therupon. And also we muste fyrste
<PB N="cxix" REF="124"/> haue his mercy or euer we moue any thing of the peace. For ye wot wel y<SUP>t</SUP> I left him bycause that peace should be made. Syr sayd y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Naymes ye speake wysely and well, but howe shal we speake wyth hym wythout Mawgys were heere? we cannot a∣wake hym. And but yf god remedy∣eth it: we shal neuer speke wyth him. But al thus as the barons spake in thys wyse: The charme that Maw∣gys had set vpon Charlemayne was come at an ende, and the strength of it was passed. And sodenly Charle∣maine began to moue hys body, and arose anon vpon his feete, and right sore abasshed looked al aboute him. And whan he saw y<SUP>t</SUP> he was at moū∣tawban in y<SUP>e</SUP> subieccion of Reynawd the sonne of Aymon: he was sore an angred, and made suche sorowe for it, so that al they that were there tro∣wed that he had ben mad and from hymselfe. And whā his wittes were come agayne: he knew wel y<SUP>t</SUP> Maw∣gys had doone it vnto hym &amp; sware that as longe as he were manne on liue: he should make no peace tyl that he were out of Mountawban, and that men had brought Mawgys to hym. And whā Rycharde vnderstode this that Charlemayne sayd: he be∣gan to saye in this wyse. Howe the deuill dare ye thus speake? syr ye see well that ye be our prysoner. And yet ye thretē vs. I make to god mine a vowe and to Saynte Peter, were not that I haue promysed, that I shal not doo to you no harme at this tyme: I should strike the head from the bodye of you. Holde your pease sayd Reynawde, let the kynge Char∣lemayne saye his wyll, ye are ouer besy in your wordes. And let vs all pray hym that he wyll pardon vs. For the warre hath lasted to longe, cursed be he that began it. For great euyles and harmes the whiche are happed therby.</P>
<P>REynawde was wyse, and wel taught for to stylle thus hys brethern, to whome he said. My lor∣des my brethern, yf it please you, ye shal come with me, for to cry mercy vnto our souerayne lorde the Empe∣rour Charlemayne. Reynawde said Alarde, we shall doo all that ye wyl. By mi faith said the duke Naimes, My lordes ye doo ryght wisely, and I promyse you that all good shall come to you therof. Than Reynawd and all hys brethren, and Rowland and Oliuer, and Ogyer the Dane, the duke Naymes, the bisshop Tur∣pin, and Escoufe the sonne of Oedō began all for to fall on theyr knees, before the emperour. And Reinawde spake fyrste, and sayd in this maner of wise. Noble Emperour haue mer¦cy of vs, for I and my brethern wee yeeld vs to you to doo your pleasure of vs, &amp; your will be so y<SUP>t</SUP> our lyues ben saued: &amp; there is nothinge but y<SUP>t</SUP> we will doo it for the loue of you if it please you to graunt vs peace w<SUP>t</SUP> you. And for that piti &amp; pardon that God gaue vnto Mary Magdelene whan she wasshed hys feete in the house of Simeon, good syr haue pity of vs. And yf it please you not for to pardon me: at y<SUP>e</SUP> least pardon my bre¦thern. And take them agayne theyr landes, and I shal gyue you Moun∣tawbā,
<PB REF="125"/> and Bayarde my good horse And so shall I goe into the holy lāde I &amp; Mawgis, where we shal serue to the Temple of our Lorde. And whan the kinge Charlemain heard Reynawde speake thus: he blastred all for angre, and sayd by that good lorde that made me, yf all the worlde speake to me therof, yet should I ne∣uer cosēt me to no peace, but I haue Mawgys in my handes for to doo my wyll vpon hym. Alas sayd than Reynawde, now haue I hearde that worde bytynge, wherof I am al des∣perate. For I should rather let my selfe be hanged, thā that I should cō∣sente to the death of Mawgys my good cosyn. For he hath not deserued towarde vs, that we should betraye hym, but rather he were worthy by reason for to be lorde aboue vs. Rey¦nawde sayd thā Charlemaine, thīke not thoughe I am your prysoner y<SUP>t</SUP> ye shall make me doo anye thynge a∣gaynst my wyll, syr sayd Reynawd wyte it that myne entente is for to meke my self toward you for I haue leuer that we suffre wronge of you, than ye of vs, now tell me syr how I shall delyuer you Mawgys that is our life, hope, sucours, our comfort, sheeld, our spere and also our swerde our brede, our wyne and our flesshe, also our refute, our mayster our gu∣yde, and our defence in all places, wherby syr I tell you that yf ye had all my brethern in your pryson, and that ye should make them to be han∣ged, and that Mawgys were with in my power and with me: yet wold I not yeelde hym vnto you for to quyte wythall my brethern. And al∣so I swere you vpon my fayth that I wot not where that he is gone, god wot it. Ha sayd the Emperour char∣lemayne, goddes curse haue he, for I am sure he is heere within you, he is not sayd Reynawde I take it vpon my baptysme. And than Rey∣nawde turned himself toward Row∣lande and all the other barons and sayd to them. Lordes I beseche you for God that it wyll please you for to pray our souerayne lorde y<SUP>e</SUP> kinge that he wyll haue mercye of me and of my bretherne, to the ende y<SUP>e</SUP> peace maye be had in Fraunce yf it please hym. And than Naymes that was kneelinge vpon his knees, and that heard that Reynawde had sayd and wyste well that he spake but well: sayde to the Emperour in this wise, Syr I pray you that ye wyll not be dyspleased of that I shall tell you, ye know syr y<SUP>t</SUP> I am suretie for Rey∣nawde, and so is Ogyer y<SUP>e</SUP> dane, but me semeth that we ought now to be discharged therof, sith that ye be here presente within his castell, but ano∣ther thynge I wyll tel you, me thin∣keth that ye ought to take, that the erle Reynawde proffereth to you or y<SUP>t</SUP> any more harme come to you ther∣of, and so helpe me God ye shall doo wel. And al they of your courte shal be glad of it. And whan the barons hearde this that Naymes had sayde to the kinge Charlemaine: they spo∣ke all and sayde. Syr doo that the duke Naymes hath tolde you, for he hath gyuen you good counsell and true. And yf so be that ye doo it not: ye shall come to late for to repente you of it.</P>
<P>But
<PB N="Cxx" REF="125"/> WHan Charlemayne vnderstode this that y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Naimes had sayd to him: he was ryght wroth of it. For his herte was so harde asto∣nyed with great angre: that he tooke no hede of good coūsel, and he sware by saynt Denys of Fraunce that he should not doo it for no man but yf he had fyrst Mawgys in hys handes for to doo hys wyll ouer hym. And whan Reynawde hearde these wor∣des: he blustered in his face for an∣gre, and rose vp from kneelinge his bretherne and all the other barons also. And then Reynawde sayde to Rowlande and to all the other Lor∣des that were there. Syr I wyl wel y<SUP>e</SUP> Charlemaine know my wil &amp; my entente, y<SUP>e</SUP> whiche I shall shew afore hym vnto you. Wyt it that syth I cā fynde no mercy in him: I praye you that ye wyll not blame me frō hence for thou, yf I seeke my ryght. For I shall seeke it in all the maners that a true knight ought to doo. And whā Reynawde had sayd this: he turned him towarde the kynge, and sayd to hym. Syr ye maye goe hens whan it please you, for by my soule ye shal haue no harme of me now, for ye be my souerayne lorde, &amp; with good wil we shalbe in good peace wyth you.</P>
<P>THe barons of fraūce y<SUP>t</SUP> were there: wundred sore of the great kindenes of Reynawde. Thā sayd y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Naymes, haue ye heard the great humilite of the noble kni∣ght Reynawde? By soule sayd row∣lande. Reynawde sayth meruaylou∣sly. I wolde not haue trowed that he should euer haue fared so fayre w<SUP>t</SUP> Charlemayne. And whan Rychard vnderstoode y<SUP>t</SUP>, that his brother Rei¦nawde had sayde: he spake in thys wise, brother Reinawde I holde you mad. What wyll ye doo? ye see that we haue in our handes this vengea∣ble kyng the whiche we may kyll or els suffre hym to lyue, &amp; yet he is set so sore to pryde that he wyll doo no∣thing that his good counsell telleth hym, but he threteneth vs alwayes more and more, and ye wil let him go thus a waye: surely brother if he sca¦peth vs so: he shal yet angre vs right sore, and I promise you yf he hadde vs as we now haue hym: he should make vs all to dye shamefullye, not al the golde in the worlde should not saue vs therfro. And therfore I tell you that ye doo greate folye to let him go thus away. For and ye wyl, ye shall now make our peace, but me semeth, ye seeke none other but your death, wherof I pray god yf ye suf∣fre him thus to goe awaye: that he maye make you to dye a shamefull death. And whā Reynawd heard his brother speke so: he was wroth &amp; sayd to hī in angre. Holde your peace bro¦ther for he shall goe his wayes quite will you or no, and the peace shal be made whan he wyll and no soner it shal not be, for there vnto he shal not be compelled of me, and go you hens from me, for your great wordes dis∣pleaseth me.</P>
<P>WHan Reynawde had sayde this: he dyd call a gentylman of hys to whome he sayd, go lightly without any taryenge to the yoman of min horses, &amp; byd him bringe me
<PB REF="126"/> my horse Bayarde. For I wyll that my souerayne lorde ryde vpon hym vnto his hoste, for he rode neuer vpō no better horse. And whan Richarde heard this: he wēt fro thens al swel∣linge with angre as a fyersfull lyon bycause he knew that Charlemayne should goe so. And wit it that y<SUP>e</SUP> king Charlemayne hearde and vnderstode well all these wordes, but he durste not saye nothyng, so sore he feared y<SUP>e</SUP> fiersnes of the yong Richard. This hangyng: came there agayne y<SUP>e</SUP> gen∣tilman that was gone for Bayarde whiche he brought with him, &amp; than Reynawde tooke his good horse bai¦arde &amp; came to Charlemayne, &amp; said to hym, syr ye maye lyght whan it please you, and goe at your lybertye, for to comforte your folke, whiche I am fure ben full sory for the taking of you. And whan Charlemayn saw this he lighted anon vpon Bayarde &amp; went out of Mountawban for to goe to his hoste, and Reynawde con∣ueyed him to the gate of Mountaw∣ban, &amp; whan the kinge was gone: he made the gate to be shet anon. And the frenche men that sawe their king come agayn: they were right gladde and receyued hym worthely, &amp; after they asked hym how it wēt with him and yf he had graunted y<SUP>e</SUP> peace lor∣des it is wel with me, God gramer∣cy, but of peace I haue made none nor neuer shall as longe as I am man a lyue for no man y<SUP>t</SUP> shal speake to me of it, but yf I haue the tray∣tour mawgis for to doo with him mi wyll. Syr sayd some of his barons how haue ye be delyuerd. By my fay∣th sayd charlemayn, Reynawde hath delyuerde me agaynst that the wyll of hys bretherne all quite at my ly∣bertie. Syr sayd the barons haue ye not seen Rowlande, Olyuer, y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Naimes the bisshop Turpin, Ogier the dane nor Escouf the sonne of oe∣don? yea surely sayd Charlemayne, but they haue all forsake me for the loue of Reynawde, wherof by y<SUP>t</SUP> god that hynge vpon the crosse yf I can haue them agayne: I shall shew thē that they haue not doone well, and whan he had sayd thus: he lyghted from Bayarde and made him to be brought agayne to Reynawde.</P>
<P>ANd whan Reynawde sawe bayarde, that Charlemayne had sent hym agayne: he called row∣land and his felawes &amp; sayd to thē, fayre lordes I know well that ye be not in the grace of the greate kynge Charlemaine for the loue of me, but I wyll not that ye haue mawgre for me nor for my brethern, and therfore fayre lordes I quyte you all quarel∣les that I maye lay vpon you, and gyue you leue to goe whan it please you. And whan the Duke Naymes vnderstode the kindnes of the hert of Reinawde that was so noble: he thā∣ked hym hyghly, and kyssed and en∣brased hym for great loue, &amp; wolde haue kneeled downe afore hym, but Reynawde wolde not suffre hym.</P>
<P>Than the duke Naymes began to saye, let vs thynke to goe after the kyng Charlemayne your vncle, sith it please Reynawde to gyue vs leue Naymes sayd Rowlande, how can we doo this, shall we leue Reynawde the whiche ye se myne vncle wyl dy∣stroye
<PB N="cxxi" REF="126"/> wrongfully? Syr said y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Naymes heare me yf it please you. I counsel that we go hens, and whan we shal be afore Charlemayne: we shall aske him how Reynawde dyd delyuer him, for yf we speake to him of peace: he shalbe wrothe wyth vs; but whan he shal remembre y<SUP>e</SUP> great goodnes and curteysy of Reynawde his hert shalbe molified, &amp; it cannot be but he shal doo to him some grace and fauour, for he shall know well y<SUP>t</SUP> his hert is ouer great, &amp; that he hath doone to Reynawde great wronge. Certes syr Naymes sayd the barons ye speake wysely, and ye giue ryght good counsell. And whan they were accorded to the counsell of the Duke Naymes: Rowlande asked after his horse, and eche of the other barons also. And whan they were redye for to lyght on horsbacke: there came mi lady Clare the wyfe of Reynawde that kissed Rowlande, Olyuer and all the other barons, and after she sayde to them in this maner. Lordes that be heere present. I beseche you in the name of god &amp; for his blessed passion y<SUP>t</SUP> it pleaseth you for to pur∣chace y<SUP>e</SUP> peace of my lorde Reynawde and semblably of hys bretherne to∣warde the great king Charlemayn, ye know my lordes that the kynge dothe to my lorde great wrong: and also ye know the great curteysy and the kyndnes that my Lorde my hus∣bād hath shewed vnto Charlemayn, and well ye wot that yf my Lorde had not be: hys brother Rycharde wolde haue striked the head from y<SUP>e</SUP> body of hym. Madame sayde y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Naymes doubt not. For and god be pleased the peace shalbe made with in these three dayes. And than they lighted al on horsbacke, and the three brethern of Reynawde conueyed thē to the gate, and Reynawde taryed after them vpon the brydge, &amp; whan they were come to the sayde brydge Reynawde sayd to them, My lordes I commende you to God. I maye no lenger goe with you, prayinge that ye wyl haue me in your remēbraūce. Then al the Peeres of Fraūce (that were there) began to weepe tenderly and tooke their leaue of Reynawde the noble knyght, &amp; after they tooke theyr way towarde y<SUP>e</SUP> hoste of Char∣lemayne. And whan the Emperour saw them come: he called to hym his barons and shewed them they that were comynge. And whan the barōs saw them: they meruayled greatly &amp; had greate feare, for they wyste not what it was, but Ydellon the Erle said, by god we haue recouered row∣lande and hys felawes, yea sayde Charlemain, godes curse haue they. Thys hangyng: Rowland and hys felawes came tofore Charlemayne and lighted a foote, and incontinent they kneeled humbly afore the king and thā the duke Naymes began to speake first and sayd. Noble Empe∣rour wee are come in your presence for to crye you mercy, beseching you for God that it will please you to take vs vnto your good grace, for we haue doone nothing agaynst you but y<SUP>t</SUP> it was for your wele. But sith y<SUP>t</SUP> we haue knowen y<SUP>t</SUP> your wyl was not for to haue peace: we haue forsa¦ken Reynawde and all his brethern nor neuer whyle we ben a liue they
<PB REF="127"/> shall haue no succours of vs. Lor∣des sayde Charlemayne I pardon you, but I tell you yf we tary heere longe stil: we shal haue lytle gaynes therby, wherfore I pray you that we go assaute Mountawban bothe by day and bi night, by such maner that he be taken of vs incontinent, &amp; they all y<SUP>t</SUP> ben in it brought to death. Sir sayd the duke Naymes ye say well, but and yf ony mifortune happeth to vs as it hath doone heere afore time: I promise you it shalbe to you great dommage, and me seemeth it were muche better to haue peace, thā for to contynewe the warre.</P>
<P>ANd whan the Barons of Fraunce heard this, that the duke Naymes had sayde to the king: they began to crye with a high voice Syr Emperour, we praye you that ye wyl doo this that Naymes coun∣selleth you. For he gyueth you good counsell. Whan Charlemayne heard the crye that hys folke made to him: he came to the duke Naymes y<SUP>t</SUP> was kneelyng afore hym, and tooke him vp, &amp; in lyke wyse his neuewe Row∣lande and all the other, and sayde to them. My lordes ye knowe that I haue pardoned you with right good wyll, but I wyll well that ye know but yf ye keep yourself fro helpinge of my enemies mortal I shal angre you vpon your bodies. For I hate them so muche that yf I should abide heere all my lyfe: I shal destroy thē. And wit it that Charlemayne was glad that he had recouered hys ne∣uew Rowlād and his other Peeres how be it he made no semblaunte of it. And he sayd yet agayne, y<SUP>t</SUP> he shold neuer departe from hys syege tyll y<SUP>t</SUP> he had taken Mountawban and all the foure sonnes of Aimon, wherof he shall doo sharpe Iustyce, &amp; shall doo brenne Mawgys y<SUP>e</SUP> false tray∣tour. Syr sayd Rowland I promise you that Mawgys is not w<SUP>t</SUP>in Moū¦tawban, for he feareth you so muche that he dare not abyde you, least yee should make him to be hanged, by∣cause he dyd steale you so falsly oute of your hoste. Ha god sayde Charle∣mayne, whan shal I see that I haue him for to doo my wyll of hym? For than the Sonnes of Aymon should soone be a greed with mee.</P>
<P>THan whan the kyng Charle∣mayne had deuysed longe y∣noughe: he gaue leaue to all hys ba∣rons for to go agayne into theyr tē∣tes for to see the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r folke. And whan the morow came: all the barons cāe agayne vnto Charlemain. And whā the kynge saw them together within his pauilion, he was therof glad, &amp; spake to them thus. Lordes I haue besyeged Mountawban as nere as ye see, and I am not dysposed for to departe hēce nother for colde, for hete nor for hungre, vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> time y<SUP>t</SUP> I haue taken hym by fyne force, the whiche thynge shall be lyghtly doone, for I am sure that they shall want vytay∣les wythin. And worse is for theym: they haue loste the traytoure Mawgys whiche was theyr hope and comforte. wherfore I saye that they cānot holde it longe against my power, whan the barons hearde y<SUP>t</SUP> Charlemayne thretened Reynawde
<PB N="cxxii" REF="127"/> so soore: there was none of them but thei were sory for it, for the most par∣te of theym loued Reynawde for the worthynes and the kyndnes that was in him. Then spake the Duke Naimes and said to the Emperour, Syr ye say that they of Mountaw∣ban be dyspurueyd of meate, and that ye shall not departe from the syege tyll that ye haue taken the castel and that is a thinge that shall be doone lightlye, but I promyse you yf ye ta∣rye to their vittailles be doo: ye shall lye here lenger thē ye ween of, wher∣fore syr I beseche you, that it wyll please you to beleue my counseyll yf it semeth you good, fyrste take heede to the curtoysy that Reynawde hath doone to you, for ye wot well that if he had not be: his brother Richarde shoulde haue slayne you, al the golde in the worlde should not haue saued you. Item thynke thenne also in the great mekenes that he hath alwaies shewed to you, also for the great trust that he hathe had in you, he leued you his good horse bayarde that hath no matche in all the world, syr yf ye o∣uerthynke well al, ye shall find that no manne dyd neuer to none other so greate curtoysye as Reynawd hath doone to you, and of that other parte he and his bretherne ben such knigh∣tes as euery body knoweth. I swe∣re to you syr by al hallowen that or e∣uer ye shal take Mountawban: Rey∣nawde and his brethern shall beare to you suche domage, wherof ye shal be wrothe. And yet ye ought well to take heed how we wast and destroye the country and the feeldes and great good ye doo dyspende, whiche for youre honoure were better to be em∣ployed vpon the sarasins: than vpon the foure sonnes of Aymon, for the sarasins been now in rest makynge great ioy for the cause of this warre, and they doo well. For warre hathe left them, and it is come among our selfe so horrible and so cruel that ma∣ny noble and worthy knyghtes ben deade therof.</P>
<P>THe kinge Charlemain was sore abashed, whan he hearde the du∣ke Naymes speake so: and it moued his bloud ful sore and became pale as a white cloth for the greate wrathe that he had at his heart, and casted a syde his sight angrely vpon the duke Naymes and sayde to hym by great wrathe. Duke Naymes by the faith that I owe to that blessed la∣dye that conceyued the sonne of god in her virginitie, that if there be any man so hardy to speake more to me of accorde to be made with the four son∣nes of Aymon: I shal neuer loue him but I shal angre hym on his bodye. For I am not dysposed to make pea∣ce with them for nothynge that can be sayd, but I shal hange them what soeuer it coste me or I departe from this syege. whan the barons hearde Charlemaine speake thus proudely: they were sore meruaylled of it, and left to talke of this matter. But whā Ogier sawe that al the barons held theym stylle: he began to saye to the kynge Charlemaine. Cursed be the houre that Reynawde suffred not Rycharde to smite of your heade, for ye had not thretned him so now. And whā Charlemayn heard that Ogier
<PB REF="128"/> sayde to him, he bowed his necke and looked downeward all pensifull and syn he sayd, now lordes make you re∣dy &amp; see that euery man fal to his ar∣mures, for I wil now gyue assaute to Mountawban. And whan y<SUP>e</SUP> fren∣shemen hearde the commaundemente of the king: they made no tarying but went &amp; armed themselfe, and whan they were al ready: they came in good ordenaunce, and broughte ladders &amp; other instrumentes with them for to saute withal the castell and engynes for to breake downe the walles, and presented thē before Charlemain for to accomplysh his wyll. And whan the kinge saw them so wel apparel∣led: he commaunded thē to goe saute the castell of Mountawban.</P>
<P>ANd as soone as Reynawde saw his enemies come: he cal∣led his brother Alarde, and sayde to him. Brother I pray you take bondy my good horne &amp; blowe in it strongly to the ende that our folke arme them selfe when they heare it, for heere co∣me the frenshmen to saute vs. whan Alard vnderstoode the commaunde∣ment of Reynawde: he tooke bondy, and blewe in it with so great a winde three tymes that all they of the castel hearde it, and were all abashed wyth all and without anye taryinge they went &amp; armed themself, and lyghtly gate vpon the walles for to defend the Castell. Neuerthelesse the frensh men came neare and entred in to the dyches as hogges doone in a myre, and dressed vp their ladders to the walles. But wyt it that they of within the castel beganne to defende so stronglye with castinge of stones: that they domaged sore the frenshe∣men so that many of them lay deade within the dyches. For Reynawd &amp; his bretherne dyd there so great fea∣tes of armes that no body myght en∣dure their strokes, who had seen the poore duchesse and her yong children at that saut bryngynge stones to Reynawde and to his brethern vpon the walles: he wolde haue had pytie of it. For the two yonge sonnes of Reinawd said to theyr vncles, holde our vncles these stones, for they been greate yn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ughe. Suche defence ma∣de they of Mountawban, that they ouerthrewe them that were vpon the ladders to the botome of the diches, all dead and sore wounded, and whan the king Charlemaine saw this: he was wrothe, for he knewe than wel that he should neuer take Mountaw∣bā by force, nor also the noble knigh∣tes that were within it, as Reinawd and his bretherne. And therfore he made the trompette to be blowen, to call his folke a backe with so greate angre that he was almoste out of his mynde, and whan the frenshmenne hearde blowe the retrete: they were glad, for they were shrewdly hande∣led, and I promyse you that Charle∣main left such a company dead with in the diches that he longe after was full sory for it.</P>
<P>WHan Charlemayn and all hys folke were wythdrawen again: he beganne to sweare Saynte Denys of fraunce that he should ne∣uer departe thence til he had famish∣ed Reynawde &amp; his bretherne within the castel of Moūtawban, &amp; than he
<PB N="cxxiii" REF="128"/> commaunded that afore euerye gate of the castel should be layed two hun∣dred knightes, for to keep that no bo¦dye might in nor oute, but he should be take. And whan Reinawde sawe that: he kneeled down vpon his kne∣es and heued vp his handes toward heauen and said. Good lord that suf∣fred deth on the crosse. I beseche you that ye wil graūt vs that grace that we maye haue peace with Charle∣main &amp; saue our liues. And whan Ri∣chard heard the praier of Reinawd: he tooke heed to it and said. Brother I promise you if ye wolde haue bele∣ued me: we shoulde nowe haue be in good rest &amp; peace. For Charlemaine wolde haue be glad therof for to saue his life, ye know that our cosin maw∣gis broughte him not heere for none other cause to be our prisoner, but to the entent that we should make our peace, but ye wold not take heed to it, whan we might haue had our wyll, and I promyse you we shall not doo as we wolde.</P>
<P>THe emperour Charlemain a∣bode so longe at the siege a∣fore Mountawban, that they that were within it had great need of vi∣taylles, for he that had any meat: he hyd it incontinent, and so great scar∣stie of vittailles was there within a while that men coulde get there no meat for golde nor for siluer, and ma∣ny other fell downe at grounde heere and there so feynt for hungre that it was great pitie for to see, for y<SUP>e</SUP> derth was there so great that thone brother hidde his meat from the other, and the father from the childe, &amp; the childe fro the father &amp; fro the mother. And shortlye to speake: I promise you that the poore folke died for hungre by the streetes, and with this was so great stenche in Mountawban of the dead that were there: that no man coulde endure it, And whan Reynawd saw this he was sorye for it, and than he dyd doo make &amp; greate charnell wher in he made all the deade bodyes to be buryed. And whan Richarde sawe so greate mortalitie within the castel of Mountawban, throughe cause of the great dearth that was there, and saw his brother Reinawd in so great distresse: he could not forbeare, but he saied to him, by god my brother nowe goeth it worse then euer it dyd, it had be muche better if ye hadde beleued me, for yf ye wolde haue suffred me to slea the kynge Charlemayne: we shoulde nowe not haue be in thys myscheef and great pouertie that we haue nowe, nor your folke hadde not dyed for hungre as they doo, and thā he began to weep tenderly and sayde Alas why doo I complayne other? I myght well complayne my selfe sithe that I must dye and be put in to the charnell as the poorest of vs all. Ha Mawgis my fayre cosyn, where be ye now? ye faile vs at oure need, for and ye were here within with vs: we shoulde not be famyshed for hungre and also we should not doubte muche the kinge Charlemaine, for I wot well that ye should get vs vitaylles ynough to lyue vpon for vs and our men, and now we muste dye for hun∣gre as the wulf should vpon a sea. for Charlemaine hateth vs more than he dooth the sarasyns. And therfore
<PB REF="129"/> it is not for vs to wayte after pitie of him, for he is ouer cruell a king vpon vs.</P>
<P>CHarlemayne by the reporte of some folke knew the great det the &amp; scarslie of vitailles that was within Moūtawbā, wher∣of he was right glad, &amp; called to him his folke and said to them. Lordes now can not Reinawd escape, but he shal soon be taken &amp; hanged, &amp; the fal∣se Richard drawen at an horse tayle, &amp; Alarde, &amp; Guichard also, and theyr worthines shall be litill worthe to them. And whan the kinge Charle∣maine had sayde these wordes: he sent for all his peeres &amp; barons, and whan they were al come within his pauillion: he was glad of it and sayd to them. Lordes thanked be god that I haue brought mountawban so low that Reinawde and hys knyghtes haue no more vitailles in it, and now they shal yeeld them selfe at my wyll mawgre their teeth, for y<SUP>e</SUP> moste parte of their folkes ben deade for hungre, and yet dien dayly, and ye must wyt I wyl that Reynawde be hanged &amp; his brethern also, but first I wil that Rychard be drawen at an horse tayl. And so I charg you that none of you be so hardye to moue my wyll to the contrary, for I will that it be doone as I saye. whan the duke Naimes Rowland, Oliuer, Ogier, the bishop Turpin, &amp; escouf, y<SUP>e</SUP> sonne of Oedon, y<SUP>t</SUP> were there heard y<SUP>e</SUP> king speke thus they were righte sorye for the loue of Reinawd &amp; of his brethern, &amp; looked down &amp; said no word at all for feare y<SUP>t</SUP> they should be shent of the king, &amp; Ogier with great payne kept his ey∣en fro weepinge lest Charlemaine should not perceiue his sorowful hert</P>
<P>HEere ye ought to wit that du∣ringe y<SUP>e</SUP> time that Charlemain laye at the siege afore Mountawban persecuting the four sonnes of Aimō Reinawd, Alard Guychard, and Ri∣charde: Aymon their father helde the party of the king ayenst his children for he had promised him to doo so, as ye haue heard about, but wit it that whan he heard howe the emperoure thretened his children, how be it that he had forsaken, them he was wrothe for it, for he knew we: if his children died so: he should neuer haue ioy after that. for whatsoeuer warre he made ayenst them, he loued them kindli as the father ought loue his childe, for nature may not lie, &amp; therfore he took so great sorow whā he heard of hys sonnes that they were thretned to be hanged: that he almost fel down dead to the ground, &amp; of the great sorow y<SUP>t</SUP> he had could not keep himselfe but he said. Sir emperour I besech you that it wil please you to bryng my childrē to right, for though I haue forsaken them, yet are they my sonnes of my body begotten. Hold your peace Ay∣mon said Charlemain, for I wil that it be so doone of thē, for Reinawd did slea my neuew barthelor that I lo∣ued so much. And after he turned him self &amp; saw y<SUP>e</SUP> barons that spake thone to thother &amp; said to them. Lordes loue your musing, for I tel you for a trou∣the that I shal not leaue to doo herin my wil for no mā y<SUP>t</SUP> speaketh ye wot wel it is iii. yere gon sith we besieged this

<P>HOwe shoulde I nowe doo this good lord said thā Aimon? for sir Emperour ye know wel y<SUP>t</SUP> they be my children, nother truantes nor knaues but be the best knyghtes of the world, &amp; so I tel you sir that if I saw theim die: I shoulde for goe my wittes for angre. And whan Charle∣maine heard Aimon speake thus: he was wroth and began to gnaw on a stafe that he held in his hand, and af∣ter said. By that god that made me if there be ani of you that gainsaith my wil: I shall strike of his heade with my swerde. Sir saide the du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Nay∣mes angre not your selfe. For that, y<SUP>t</SUP> ye haue cōmaunded: shal be doone in∣continent. whan the barons vnder∣stood the cōmaundemente of Charle∣main: they went their way for to ma∣ke y<SUP>e</SUP> engines that the king had com∣maūded, the whiche were anon made ready &amp; these engines were for to cast greate multitude of stones. And as soon y<SUP>t</SUP> they were made: they were set for to cast ayen moūtawbā &amp; in short time they dōmaged it ful sore, &amp; so I promise you y<SUP>t</SUP> within the castel were made greate crying of women and of children, &amp; for feare of the stones they went and hid them vnder the ground and so thei of Mountawban endured this mischef as longe as they had a∣ny morsell of meat. And I ensure you that there was so great derth and so great mortalitie: y<SUP>e</SUP> men wist nomore where to laye the deade. For the char∣nell was al full. Alas who had seen so yong bachelers that for feintnes went leninge vpon their staues tho∣rough Moūtawbā for lacke of meat: he wolde haue had great pitie. For a∣fore that the castel was besieged they were so stronge and so mightye that none could haue ouercome them, but they were than so feble that they fell where they went, musselinge in the grounde as hogges.</P>
<P>ANd whā Reinawd saw the great pitie that was among his folke: he had of it great sorow be∣cause he mighte not put no remedye therto, and than he began to saye in himself. O good lorde what maye I now doo? now I se wel my wyt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uail¦leth me nothing, for I wot not where to seeke vitailles. Alas god where may Mawgis be now that he know not my great need and the outrage y<SUP>t</SUP> Charlemaine dooth to vs. And whā the good lady clare saw her lord Rei∣nawd that complained him selfe so piteously: she began to say vnto hym in this wise. For soth my lord ye doo not wel for to discomfort your self so sore, for ye discourage vs al within, moreouer I promise you that heere been yet within mo than a C. horses, I pray you let one of theim be killed, and ye, my selfe and our poore childrē
<PB REF="130"/> shal eat of it, for it is more than three daies agoe that they nor I eate anye thing that did vs good, and whā she had said this: she fel down in a swou∣ne at the feete of Reynawde her hus∣band, for greate feblenes for lacke of meate. And whan Reinawde sawe her fall: he tooke her v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> anone in his armes, and after that she was come againe to her selfe, she saide all weeping. Alas dere lady mary what shal I poore wr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tche doo for all my heart failleth me, and almost wil my soule departe? also sore is my bodye famished alas mi childrē who should euer haue wende that ye should haue died for hungre.</P>
<P>WHan Reynawd saw the greate distresse wherin his wyfe was: he had greate pitie of heer, and the teeres began to fall ouer the chee∣kes of hym, and al weepyng he went to his stable, and there he made a hor∣se to be slayne, the whiche he made to be dressed for meate to hys folke, but I promyse you that horse flesh lasted not longe afore theym for they were menne ynowe to eate it vp lyghtly. And heere ye must know that all the horses that were within Mountaw∣ban: were in lykewise eaten, one af∣ter a nother, excepte foure, that is to wyt Bayarde and the horses of the three bretherne of Reynawde the whiche foure horses they wolde not eat by cause they wolde not be a foot. And whan Reinawd sawe that there was no more thyng that they might eate: he called his bretherne and said to them. Faire bretherne what shall we doo? we haue no more foode to take vs but onely our foure horses that are left alyue. Lette vs doo kille one of theym that oure folke may eat with vs. By my heade sayde Ry∣chard that shal not be mine, and yf ye h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue iust to it: let yours be slayne, for ye shall not haue m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne, and yf ye ha∣ue great myscheeftye be wel worthy for throughe youre pryde: we are brought in this plyght, bycause that ye lette goe the king Charlemayn, for and if ye had beleued me: thys greate myshappe had not be fall vs. Thys hanging: came the lityll Aimon the sonne of Reinawd that sayde to Ri∣chard in this maner. Holde your pea∣ce myn vncle, for that thing that mai not be amended, men oughte to let it passe in the best wise. For it is to sha∣mefully to reherse that, that is passed but doo as my father commaundeth you &amp; ye shal doo wel. For ye doo nor well to angre him so as ye doo, and though he hath missed of his entent, he hath boughte it deare ynoughe as wel as we, if the king Charlemaine hath domaged you longe, it may well hap that god shall helpe you or ought longe, if it please him, and I beleue certenlye that he shall doo so, for the kyndnes that my lord my father did shew vnto charlemain whan he had him heere, can neuer be lost as I we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>GReat pytie had Richarde of his neuewe whan he hearde hym speake thus wysly &amp; tooke him betwen his armes and kissed him al weeping, and than he said to Reinaw¦de. Brother commaund my horse to
<PB N="cxxv" REF="130"/> be slayne whan it please you, and gi∣ue some comfort therwithall to thys folke and to my lady your wyfe and to my yong neuewes youre children. For my litel neuew that is here hath wel deserued to eate of it for the good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounseyll that he hathe giuen to me now. Brother said Alard, let be slain whiche ye will of three, for it were to great adommage if bayard should dye, and also I tell you that I had le∣uer dye my selfe than that Bayarde shoulde be slayne. Brother sayde Guychard, ye say wel, and anon the horse of Richard was killed and dre∣sed to their meat, and so in lyke wise was doon with the horses of the two other bretherne, and full sauourly it was eaten. And whan Reinawde sawe that there was no meat more: he wist not what he should doo, for he was more sory for his bretherne and for his wife, and his childrē, than he was for him selfe, and began to saye in this wise. Alas what shal I doo? I am vanquished &amp; ouercome with out any stroke. It had be better for me to haue beleued my brother Ry∣charde, for I had not be nowe in the myserye and greate need where I am in at this houre. Now I see wel that Charlemaine hath chased me so mu∣che that he hath betrapped me with∣in his gynnes, wheroute I can not scape, and I know wel that I ought not to be complayned, for I haue ma∣de my selfe the rodde wherwith I am beaten, and yf I shoulde repente me therof: it shoulde profyte nothinge, for I come to late for to doo so. whan Richarde saw his brother Reinawd make suche sorowe: he knewe well hys mynde, and was ryghte sory for hym, so that he shooke al for sorow, and wyst not what he shoulde saye. For yf Reynawd wolde haue hadde of his owne fleshe: Rycharde wolde wel haue gyuē hym of it, yf he might haue be comforted therwith. Then spake Guychard that other brother and sayd. My good brethern what shall we doo? we shall yeelde our self or elles dye heere for rage of hungre, and we may no more from hēce forth on, but onelye wayte after deathe. What say you brother Guichard said Reinawd, wyll we yeeld our selfe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the moste cruel king of the world for he shoulde make vs all t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>anged shamefully, if any pitie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> foū∣de in him: I wolde yeeld <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ladlye but ther is none in him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>herfore I am delybered that we shal not yeel∣de vs to him, we shall rather eat my children, and after our bodyes. But alwayes if ye will ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e bayarde: I am therof contente for to passe the tyme for thou, for I haue ofte hearde saye, that a daye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>espite is worthe muche. But neuerthelesse what so e∣uer he sayde, he had no courage to eat Bayard, for it was al his succours. Brother sayde Alarde. I counseyll that we eate Bayarde, rather then we shoulde yeelde vs in to the han∣des of Charlemyane, for he is to cru∣el, nor he shall neuer haue mercye of vs. And whan Reinawde sawe that they wold eat bayarde hys good horse: he tooke for it such a heresy so∣row that he almost fell in a swoune to the earth, but he tooke togither his strengthes and stoode vpryghte and began to saye. Faire bretherne what
<PB REF="131"/> wyll ye doo? will ye eate bayarde my noble horse, that so ofte hath kept vs from death and from perill mortall? and I pray you that afore ye slea him that ye slea me, for I maye not see him die, and whan ye haue slaine me: slea him hardelye. And if ye will not doo so: I forbed you in as muche as ye loue me that ye touch not baiard, for he that shal hurt him: shal hurt me And whan the duchesse hearde Rei∣nawd speake thus? she wist not what to doo, than she said to him in greate wrathe. Ha gentill duke debonayre, and what shall now doo your poore chyldren? wyll you that they die for hunger for faute of youre horse? For it is three daies passed y<SUP>t</SUP> thei eat any meate, shortely shal theyr lyues come at an ende and mine also, for my hert cleaueth in my body for fine force of hungre, and so shall ye see me die pre∣sently, but if I haue succours. Whan the children heard the mother speake thus: they saide to Reinawde. Good father for goddes loue deliuer youre horse, for he shal die as wel for hun∣gre, and it is better that he dye fyrste than we afore him. And whan Alard Guycharde, and Rycharde hearde their nenewes speake thus: Richard spake and said to his brother. Ha gē¦till duke for god suffre not that your children nor my lady youre wife dye for hungre, and we also. And whan Reinawd heard his brotoer Richard speake so to him: his hearte tendred with al right sore, &amp; fel to wep, &amp; said my fayre bretherne sith that it please you that bayard shal die: I praye you goe and slea him. And whan they were al accorded that baiard shoulde be slaine and eatē: they went streight to the stable, where thei found baiard that casted to them a greate syghe. And whan Reynawde sawe that: he saide he shoulde rather flea himselfe, than that baiard should die, that ma∣ny tymes hath saued him fro deathe. And whan the children had hearde this: they returned agayne to their mother weeping &amp; al dead for hūgre.</P>
<P>THan whan Reinawde sawe that his children were gone: he went to bayarde, and gaue him a litill hey, for he had none other thing to giue him. And than he came to his bretherne, and found Alard holdinge Aimon his neuewe that wepte, and Rychard held you, and Guichard, the duches, that in his armes was swo∣ned, and said to theim. Alas for God mercy. I praye you take in you cou∣rage till night, and I promise you y<SUP>t</SUP> I shal doo so much that we shal haue meate, and god wil. Brother said A∣larde we must suffre it wolde we or not. So longe abode the knightes y<SUP>t</SUP> the night came, and whan it was co∣me: Reinawd said to his bretherne. My brethern I wil go speake to our father, for to see what he shall say to me, and if he shal let vs dye for hun∣gre. Brother said Richard I wyl goe with you if it please you, and ye shal be the more fure that I be in your cō∣pani. My brother said y<SUP>e</SUP> good knight Reinawd, ye shall not so, for I wyll goe there alone, and if I bringe you not meate: I shall than delyuer you bayarde. And whan Reynawde had said this: he made himselfe to be wel armed, and lyghted vpon bayarde,
<PB N="cxxvi" REF="131"/> and wel secretly went oute of Moū∣tawban, and came to his fathers pa∣uillion, the which he knew wel. For he had aspyed it from aboue the great towre while it was daye. And it hap∣ped so that he found his father Aimō oute of his pauillion all alone way∣tynge yf he might by anye waie vn∣derstand some tydynges priuelye of the castel. And whan Reynawde saw his father: he said to him. What arte thou that goe nowe at this tyme of the nighte all alone? And whan Ay∣mon heard him speake: he knew him anon and was right glad, but he ma∣de of it no semblaunt, and said to him but what art thou thy selfe that goest at this houre so hie mounted? Whan Reinawde, hearde his father speake: he knewe him wel and saide to him. Syr for god haue mercy vpon vs, for we die all for hungre, and al our hor∣ses ben al ready dead &amp; eaten, &amp; so we haue no more but bayarde, that shall not die as longe as I lyue, for rather I should let me be slaine, for to me &amp; to my bretherne he hathe often saued our lyues.

<P>HA faire sonne saide Aimon, I can not helpe you for nothing, but goe your waye agayne, for I ha∣ue you forsworne ye wot it well, and therfore I wolde not doo ayenst min othe, for all the good in the worlde, and my hearte is ryghte sorye that I may not helpe nor gyue you succour. Syr sayde Reinawd ye speake yll, saufe your reuerence. For I promyse you if ye gyue vs no succoures: that my wife, my children, my bretherne and my selfe shal die for rage of hun∣gre or euerthree daies ben passed. For it is all ready more then three dayes that none of vs eat any meat, and so I wot not what I shall doo. Alas ye be our father so ought you to com∣fort vs. For I wot well if the kinge haue vs: he shall make vs all to be hanged and dye shamefully. Whyche were not your worshippe, wherfore my father ye ought not to faylle vs yf the lawe of nature is rightwyse. My father for god haue pitie &amp; mercy vpon vs, and holde not your coura∣ge ayenst your poore children, for it were great crueltie, and also ye know well that Charlemaine dooth to vs great wronge, for to persecute vs as he dooth. whan Aymon hearde Rey∣nawd speake thus: he had greate pity of him, and was so sory that almoste he fell downe in a swoun to the erth and after he began to behold his chil¦de Reynawd &amp; sore wepinge he sayde to him. Faire sōne ye haue said trou∣the that the kinge doothe you greate wrong, &amp; therfore a lyghte fro youre horse and entre within my pauylliō and take what it please you for no∣thynge shall be saide naye to you, but I shall not gyue you nothing for to saue mine oth. And whan Reinawd heard his father speake so: he descē∣ded a foot &amp; kneled before him, &amp; said an hundred gramercyes deare father and than he entred within the pauil∣lion of his father, and laded bayarde with bread &amp; with flesh both fair and freshe, and wyt it that bayarde dyd
<PB REF="132"/> bere more then x. other horses should haue doone. And whan Reynawde had wel laded bayarde with vitailes: he tooke leaue of his father &amp; went a gayne to Mountawban, it is not to be asked what welcome Reynawde had of his brethern, of his wife, and of his men, &amp; wyt it that whan they saw him bring so much vitailes: they swouned al for ioye to the earth, and whan Reinawd saw this: he wende they had ben dead for hungre. So be∣gan he to make great sorow and not without a cause, and while that Rei∣nawde sorowed and made great mo∣ne: his brethern began to come again to theymselfe his wife and also hys two children. And whan Reinawd saw them al vpon their feet: he was glad and presented to them meat for them and for hys folke, and they thā made great Ioy and eate their fill at theyr ease. And whan they had eaten well: they went to slepe excepte Rey∣nawde that wolde keep watche hym self. And on the morne whan the day was come: they rose &amp; went to heare masse, and after the masse was doon they fell to their meate againe, and eat al that was left ouer euyn of that Reinawde had broughte, and whan the next night was come, Aimon (y<SUP>t</SUP> coulde not forget his children) made his stuarde to come before him and sayde to him, ye know how I haue forsworn my children, wherof I am sori that euer I did so. But it is said that ar the need the frend is knowen, I let you wit that my children been yonder within in great pouertye and misease, and howe be it that I haue forsworn thē: I oughte nor maye not faile them, we haue three engyines that Charlemain hath made me doo make for to hurt my children wherof we haue domaged them as muche as we might, nowe must we helpe them after their domage. And I shall tell you, see that ye put within the engy∣nes bread and flesh both salt &amp; freshe in great plenty in stead of stones, and let this be cast in to the castell, for yf I shoulde die my selfe for hungre I shall not fayle theym as longe as: I haue wherof to helpe them, and also I repent me full sore of the harm that I haue doon to them, for al the world ought to blame me therof with good ryghte, and we been in the wronge. Syr saide the stuarde ye saye well. For ye haue doone so muche ayenste them that al the worlde blameth you therof, but incontinente I shall doo your commaundement. And than y<SUP>e</SUP> stuard went and made the three en∣gins to be filled with vittailles, and after he bad the gouerner to cast thē in to Mountawban. And ye muste wyt that many of the hoste blamed Aymon sore, that he made hys en∣gynes to be caste ayenst hys chyldren for they wende it had be stones, and whan the nighte was passed &amp; that Reinawd was vp: he went heere and there within the castel, &amp; found foison of vittailes that his father had cast, wherof he was right glad and sayde Good lorde blessed be you, now see I wel that they that haue their trust in you can not fare amis, &amp; than he cal∣led his brethern his wife &amp; his chil∣drē &amp; said. My bretherne ye see howe our father hath pity of vs. And then he made the vittailles to be gathered
<PB N="cxxvii" REF="132"/> vp and put in a sure place, and so thei eate therof at their ease for they had well great need therof, for they were so sore an hungred that it was greate pitie. And wyt it that Aymon made easte so muche vytayll within Moū∣tawban: y<SUP>t</SUP> they of within had ynou∣ghe for thre monethes with good go∣uernaunce.</P>
<P>NOw must we vnderstond y<SUP>t</SUP> Charlemain had some know∣lege howe the olde duke Aimon had giuen vittailes to his childrē, wher∣of he was sore an angred &amp; made Ai∣mon to come incontinente afore him &amp; sayd to hym. Aymon who maketh thee so bolde to giue any m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at to min enemies mortal? I know wel al thy wyles, thou mayst not excuse thiself, but by the faythe that I owe to God I shall auenge me so well or nyght: that if I may ye shal leese your heade for it. Sir said the duke Aimon, I wil not denie it, for I tell you truely if ye should make me dye or be brente in a fyre: I will not fayle my chyldren as longe as I maye helpe them. For my children be no theues traytours nor no murderers, but they been the most valiaunt knightes of the world &amp; the truest, &amp; ween not you to slea my chil∣dren in suche maner, ye haue to longe wrought your foly yf it wolde suffise you. whan Charlemayne heard Ay∣mon speake thus: he was angrye with it, &amp; for great wrath he loked as fire &amp; Almost he smote Aimon, &amp; whā the duke Naimes saw this: he auaū∣ced him forth &amp; said. Sir sende home Aimon for ye haue kepte hym heere to lōg, ye ought well to vnderstande that Aymon wil not see his children to be dystroyed, and therfore ye ought not to blame him nor smite him, after that Charlemayne hearde the duke Naimes speake: he sayd to him. Nai∣mes syth that ye haue iudged it: ye shall not be gaynsayd, &amp; than he tur∣ned him towarde the duke Aymon &amp; sayde to hym. Now goe forth out of myn hoste, for ye haue doon me more domage than profyte, sir said the du∣ke Aimon. I shal gladly doo your cō∣maundemente. And anon he went &amp; lighted on horsebacke, and after said to the peeres of fraunce. Lordes I pray you al that ye wil haue my chil∣dren for recommēded, for they bē com of your bloude, &amp; let the king see well to, for yf he make my children to dye by such great vengeaunce as he hath sayd: if I shoulde become a sarasyn &amp; dwel in Affryque al the dayes of my lyfe: I shal stryke of his head, for no∣ne other gage I wyll not take. And whan Aimon had said thus: he went out of thost into fraunce to his coun∣trye wel heuy bicause that he left his children in so great pouerty, &amp; Char∣lemayne that sawe Aymon goe thus quite, and that he hadde garnyshed Mountawban of vitaylles: he was full angrye for it. So studyed he vp∣on this a longe whyle. And whan he had studyed longe ynoughe: he was so sory that none myght be more sori∣er, and returned hym selfe towarde hys Barons, and sayde Lordes I commaund you that ye breake al our engynes. For by theym I haue mys∣sed to haue the castell of Mountaw∣ban. And incontinente the Barons made breake the engines as the king
<PB REF="133"/> had commaunded. And by all thus Reinawd abode a long while in good peace, but their vittailles began sore to mynyshe. And whan Reinawde sawe that: he was sory, and began to complayne in himselfe, &amp; saide good lorde what shal I doo? I knowe that at longe rennynge we shall not mow holde, and so shall Charlemain haue no mercye of vs, but he shall make vs die. Alas Mawgis where be you? For if ye were with vs we shoulde doubte nothinge nor I shoulde not suffre this great distres that I haue. All thus as Reinawde complained hymselfe: than came Alard that was so feble that with payne he mighte stande vpon his feete, and sayde to Reynawd. Reinawde for the loue of god make bayarde to be slayne. For I may no lenger lyue without meate, nother yet my bretherne.</P>
<P>THan whan Reynawd heard his brother Alard speke th{us}: he was ryght sorye for it and tooke his swerd &amp; went to bayarde for to slea him. And whan bayarde sawe Reynawde he began to make greate Ioye, and whan Reynawde saw the there that bayard him made: he sayd to him. Ha bayarde good beaste, yf I had the herte to doo thee harme I were well cruell. And than yonnet the yonger sonne heard that: he cried vnto his father, sir wherfore tary ye that ye slea not bayarde sith he must dye, for I wexe madde for hungre, and so I tell you yf I haue not short¦ly some foode: ye ye shal seeme die a∣fore your eyen, &amp; yet my mother &amp; my brother also, for we may not lenger lyue thus so harde we been famished. And whan Reinawd hearde hys son∣ne speake to him so: he had great pity of him, and great sorow in his heart, and so he had of bayarde that cheted him so muche. Than wiste not Rey∣nawde what he should saye nor doo, and so began to thinke alonge while And whan he had bethoughte him selfe longe ynoughe: he aduysed him howe Bayarde shoulde not dye. And tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he called after a basyn, and ma∣de bayarde be lette bloode much, and after he had let him bloude ynough: Reynawd stopped the vayne and ga∣ue y<SUP>e</SUP> bloud to Alard for to be dressed. And whan it was soden they eate all alytell therof, whyche gaue them great sustenaunce. And to saye the trouth: Reinawde and his folke we∣re well foure dayes without any o∣ther foode. And whan it came to the v. day that they wolde haue had bay∣ard let bloud againe: he was so feble that he caste no bloude at all. And whan the duchesse sawe that she be∣gan to weep tenderly and sayde. Sir for god sith that he giueth no more bluod let him be slayne, and so shall eate your poore children of him that dyen for great hungre, &amp; I also. Ma∣dame saide thanne Reinawd I wyl not doo so. For bayard hath born vs good companye in oure lifes and so shall he doo till the houre of our deth for we shal dye all togyther. And ye ought to know that Reinawde and his company were brought so lowe that they waited none other but deth the whiche was them nigh ynough, Than an olde man that was amōg theim came and sayde to Reynawde vp
<PB N="Cxxviii" REF="133"/> Syr what shal it be? I see that you &amp; Mountawban shalbe destroyed, but in you is not the faute, for it hath be well defended as longe as ye might as it apeereth, and sith that I see yee mai no more doo: come after me and I shal shew you away, where throu∣ghe we shall well all goe out wyth out any daunger, and I wyll well that ye knowe Mountawban was once made and shytte, afore ye dyd make it, and the Lorde that buylded it fyrst: let make a waye vnder the erth that bringeth folke to the wood of y<SUP>e</SUP> serpent, &amp; I was a yonge childe whan that way was made, &amp; I know well where it lieth, doo digge where I shall shewe you: and ye shall finde it without any fayle, and thus shall we go free w<SUP>t</SUP>out any daunger. whā Reynawde heard theese wordes: he was so glad of it that none might be more, so that he forgat his hungre with all and sayde. O fayre God y<SUP>t</SUP> all made, blessed be you. Now haue I founde that I desyred, for I shall goe to Ardeyne whiche I ought to loue deere. And thā he tooke the olde man by the hande and made him to bringe him to the place where he said and there he made to be digged in the erth and founde the way that y<SUP>e</SUP> olde man sayd, wherof he was right glad and than he wente to the stable and put the sadle vpon Bayarde and af∣ter brought him to the way, but wit it that Bayarde was so feble that he scante coulde go the pase, and thā Reynawde, hys wyfe, hys brethern, hys chyldren and the remenaunte of hys folke put theym selfe to the way vnder the erthe, so that no crea¦ture a lyue abode w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thin the castell.</P>
<P>GReat plentie of torches Rey∣nawde made to be fyred y<SUP>t</SUP> thei might see the better within the caue as they wente, and he ordeyned hys forwarde of that fewe folke that he had, and wente forth in good ordey∣naunce with his baner displayed, &amp; he with his bretherne made the rere¦garde. And whan they had gone a longe whyle through the Caue that was wyde &amp; large: Reynawde made his folke to tary and sayd to hys bre¦thern, my brethern wee haue doone euyll. For we haue lefte behinde vs kynge Yon in the prison, certes I should leuer dye: than that I should leaue him so, for he should dye there for hungre as a famisshed wolfe, &amp; that were to vs great sinne. By god sayd Richarde he hath well deserued it, for of a man y<SUP>t</SUP> is a traytour: men ought not to haue pitie, brother sayd Reynawde ye say yll. And than he re∣turned agayne &amp; came to the pryson where the king Yon was, whiche he tooke out &amp; brought with him. And whā the duchesse sawe her brother y<SUP>e</SUP> kynge Yon come: she sayde to hym.</P>
<P>Ha my brother ye are right yll come to me: for al the harme that we haue suffred: cometh thoroughe cause of you. I am sory that ye be not dead &amp; roten within the prison, for ye haue well deserued it. Madame sayd Rey∣nawde, let that alone I pray you, for he shall not dye yf I maye. For I haue doone to him homage, where∣fore I ought to obey hym, and how be it he hath wrought ful yl agaynst
<PB REF="134"/> vs: yet shall I neuer be forsworne a∣gaynst him, whā his brethern heard him speake thus: they sayde to hym, brother ye speake well &amp; wyselye, &amp; ye doo that ye ought to doo, nor ye shall neuer he rebuked of vs for it, doo therin as it pleaseth you, and af∣ter these wordes: they went on their waye.</P>
<P>SO longe went these knightes that they came out of y<SUP>e</SUP> caue, and found themselfe at the wood of the serpent euyn at the spryng of the day, &amp; as soone as they were yssued out of the sayd caue they were so sca∣ped fro Charlemayne: Yonnet than the lytle sonne of Reynawde swou∣ned there for great hungre. And whā Reynawde sawe that: he was ryght sori for it, and tooke him vp and said Fayre sonne I praye you be a good cheere, for we shall haue soone meat great plentie. And whan he had said this: he tooke his other sonne Aymō in his armes and recomforted hym muche. And whan Reynawde had doone so: he looked aboute him and knew well where they were, and he sayd to his brethern. Lordes me se∣meth that we ben nyghe the hermy∣tage of my good freende Bernarde, syr sayd Alarde yee saye trouth, but what shall we doo? Brother sayde Reinawde. I coūsel for y<SUP>e</SUP> moste pro∣fytable that we go there, and we shal abide there tyll the nyght be come, &amp; than we shall take our way towarde Ardeyne, for I counsel not that wee goe bi day and also it cannot be, but the heremite shall haue some meate, whiche we shall gyue vnto my wife and vnto my chyldren. Brother said Alarde by my faythe ye speake well and wysely. And than they put them selfe to the way, and they had gone but a litle: that they founde the here∣mitage, but as they went al thorou¦ghe the wood of the serpent: they de∣parted the one frō the other as wilde beastes eatyng the herbes and gras∣ses as it had ben apples or Peres, so great hungre they had. And whan that Reynawde saw this: he was so∣ry and called them agayne and sayd. Lordes ye doo not wel for to separe thus the one from the other. For it might lightli turne vs to dommage I pray you that euerye man call o∣ther and gather your selfe together, &amp; let vs goe into the hermytage. For we shall fynde there Bernarde that shall make vs good cheere I wote it wel. And whā they were come there: Reynawde knocked at y<SUP>e</SUP> gate. And whan Bernarde hearde it: he came anon and saw Reynawde and hys folke, wherof he was ryght glad, &amp; came and kyssed Reynawde. And af∣ter he sayd vnto him, Fayre lorde ye be ryght welcome, of whens come you, and howe is it with you? My freende Bernarde sayde than Rey∣nawde. Wyt it that I haue let myne herytaunce by fyne force of hungre and so I goe vnto Ardeyne. For I can none otherwise doo at this time And I pray you that yf ye haue ani meat: that ye for goddes sake wyll gyue it to my wyfe, and to my chyl∣dren. For they ben so sore famysshed that they dye for hungre, but yf they haue some meate.</P>
<PB N="Cxxix" REF="134"/>
<P>WHan Bernarde vnderstoode these wordes of Reynawde: he had of hym great piti for the distresse wherin he saw Reynawde and hys folke. And of the other parte he was glad whan he wyste that they were scaped out of the daungers of Char¦lemayne, and anon he wente to the duchesse and sayd to her, madame ye be ryght welcome. I pray you doubt nothing. For ye be aryued in a good place, to take your rest at your ease. And than he wente into the Cham∣bre, and brought out bread and wine and all suche as god had sente hym. And after he set hī beside Reynawde and sayd to him Lorde take a worth suche vitayles as God hath gyuen to me, there they ben. I shal giue you meate in dispite of Charlemayne, Gramercy sayd Reynawde, heere bē good tidinges for vs, but whan the nyght is come: Wee shall goe to Ar∣deyne. For I doubt sore that Char∣lemayne shall aperceyue that we bē departed. For yf God graunt me y<SUP>t</SUP> I may brynge me and my companye to Ardeyne: I shal not set a roton ap¦ple for all the power of Charlemain for I shall well defende me agaynst hym. Syr sayde the hermyte ye saye well. I pray god that he wyll fulfil your wyll. All that daye soiourned Reynawde and his folke wyth Ber∣narde the Heremite, the whyche ser∣ued, and comforted them with al hys power, and also he gaue of the Otes of hys asse to Bayarde as muche as he myght eate. And whan the nyght was come: Reynawde wolde depart and bad fare well to the Heremite, and whan the Heremyte sawe that they wolde goe away: he founde the meanes that they had three horses, wherof the duchesse had the one, and the children had the other tweyne. And thus Reynawde wyth hys fe∣lawshyp went on theyr way so lōge that they came to Ardeyne. And whā they of the Citie wyste that theyr Lorde was come y<SUP>t</SUP> they had desyred so longe: they were well glad &amp; came agaynst hym in fayre company, and receyued hym honourably, and con∣ueyed him vnto the fortresse, &amp; after they went &amp; made feast through all the towne, lyke as god had descēded there, for greate Ioye that they had of theyr Lorde Reynawd. And whan the Barons of the lande wyst that theyr Lorde Reynawde and his bre∣thern were come to Ardeyne: they were glad, and came soone to se him, and to hym they made reuerence.</P>
<P>¶ But heere leaueth the historye to speake of Reynawde and of hys bre∣therne, his wyfe and hys children y<SUP>t</SUP> were in ardeyne wel at ease, for their great hungre was ceased, and shal re¦turne to speake of Carlemayne and of his .xii. peeres for to shew howe he entred into Mountawban after that Reynawde was departed.</P>

<P>IN this party shewed the histo∣ry that whan the kynge Char∣lemaine was at y<SUP>e</SUP> siege before Moū∣ntawban sore an angred y<SUP>t</SUP> he coulde not take Reinawd nor his brethern. Now it happed vpon a day y<SUP>t</SUP> Char∣lemayne rode nighe the Castell for to wyt how they bare them self with in Mountawban, And whan he was nigh: he looked vp to the walles and saw no body that was there, as thei were wonte for to be. And whan he saw that: he was abasshed of it, &amp; came to the pauilyon, and sente In∣continent for all hys barons. And whan they were come: he sayd to thē Lordes it is wel nyghe eyght dayes age y<SUP>t</SUP> I saw no body vpon the wal∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of Mountawban, wherefore I beleue that all they of it be dead. Syr sayde the Duke Naymes, it were good that men wyst the trou∣the of it: sende thether syr if it please you. Whan Carlemayne hearde thys: he lyghted anon on horsbacke and all hys Barons wyth hym, &amp; wente to Mountawban. And whan they were come vnto the gate: they made semblaunte to giue a sawt to the Castell, but Reynawde was to ferre for to defēde it. And than Char¦lemayne wende verelye that Rey∣nawde and all hys had ben dead for hungre &amp; great distresse, he made to be brought thether a longe ladder and righted it to the walles. And in∣contynent Rowlande mounted vp fyrst of all, and after him Ogyer, O∣liuer, and the Duke Naymes. And whan they were vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> walles: thei
<PB N="cxxx" REF="135"/> behelde within, and they saw nother man nor woman, and so they wente downe from the walles, and yede &amp; opened the gate, and made Charle∣mayne to come in and all his folke. But wyt it that Charlemayne wēt in as angry as any man myght bee. And whan he was within &amp; founde no body: he was so sore merueyled that he wyst not what he should say nor doo. So wente he vp to the dun∣geon and he founde there no bodye, wherof he was more meruayled thā he was afore, and than he began to say. By my soule Lordes heere is great meruayles and wel the deuyl∣les werke. Wyt it that Reynawde is gone and all hys brethern, and all hys folke also. And all this hath doon that theef Mawgys that hath ben here within, for it can none other wyse be.</P>
<P>AFter that Charlemayne had sayd these wordes: he began to walke within the Castell sekynge all aboute to see yf he might finde Reynawde or any of his bretherne. And so longe he wente thus heere &amp; there that he founde the waye there as they went out, &amp; whan the kynge Charlemayne saw the caue: he was sore abasshed with it and called O∣gyer the dane &amp; sayd to him. Ogyer heere is the way where thoroughe y<SUP>e</SUP> traytours are gone awaye, and all this hath doone me Mawgis. For he hath made this caue in dyspite of me wherof he maketh my hert to breke in my bely. Syr sayd the duke Nay∣mes, ye blame Mawgys, but thys Caue sheweth not that it had be vn∣made this hundred yeres passed, and I tell you for certayne that sarasins made it firste. Whan Charlemayne hearde these wordes: he beganne to smile with an angri fare, and cursed them that made the Caue, and was meruaylousli an angred, for he knew well that Reynawde and all his cō∣pany were gone out at the same hole and so he was dismyssed of his pur∣pose, he sayd then to his folke. Now goe lightly in, &amp; seke where this hole bringeth men vnto, for I shal not be at mine ease tyl I know it. And whā Rowland vnderstode Charlemain: he put hym selfe wythin the Caue, and made lyght a great many of tor∣ches for to see in it, and after Row∣lande went plentie of Frenthe men that folowed hym, and they wr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so longe til they came at the ende of the caue, &amp; founde themself in the wood of the Serpente. And whan Row∣lande was come out of the caue: he looked aboute for to knowe where they were but he coulde not hymself know it, &amp; than he sayd to his folke, Lordes me semeth that for to goe a∣ny forther for to seke after Reinawd it were but foly: for he knoweth wel the countrey and we wot not where to goe. Syr sayd his felawes ye say wel, therfore let vs returne to Char∣lemayne your vncle for to tell hym what we haue founde wythin thys Caue.</P>
<P>WHan Rowlande and his felo∣wes were accorded: they re∣turned that waye that they were come. And whan the kynge sawe them come out agayne: he asked of
<PB REF="136"/> them what they had founde, and yf they had found any yssue to goe out of the Caue. Syr sayde Rowlād yea without anye fayle. Wit that Rey∣nawde and his folke are scaped you and they haue Bayarde with them for heere ye may see the path. And whan the king Charlemayne knew the trouth how Reynawde and hys cōpany were gone: he was so great∣ly an angred y<SUP>e</SUP> none might be more, and the same houre he sent his mes∣sangers in all his landes and coun∣treis for to wit yf he might vnder∣stande any tidinges where Reinawd and his brethern were become. And whan he had doone thys: he cōmaū∣ded that his hoste should dyslodge, &amp; that they should come all to Moun∣tawban. And whan y<SUP>e</SUP> barons heard the king: they did his commaunde∣ment, and came al to Mountawban &amp; lodged them as wel as they could, &amp; abode wel there six dayes making great Ioye that Reynawde and hys bretherne were thus expelled out of it. And as the barons were deuising wythin Mountawban there came a messanger to fore Charlemayne, and salued him as to him apperteyned, and to him he said in this wise. Sir wyt it that I haue seene Reynawde Alarde, Guieharde, and Richarde lo¦kynge great to ye with great compa¦ny of knightes, keping a great cour¦te within the citie of Ardeyne, where as Reynawde gyueth great gyftes to euery one. And I am sore meruey∣led where he hath gotten so greate treasur. And also is there with him the kyng Yon of gascoygne and that more is I tell you for certayne that Reynawde hath made a great assē∣ble of folke for to defend hym agaīst you if ye go in any wise for to assaile hym.</P>
<P>THe kinge was muche angry whā he heard his messangere so sware he by saynt denis he should neuer lye in no bed tyll he had besye∣ged Ardeyne. And whan he sayd so: he commaunded to his barons that euery mā should trusse his baggage and they should take on theyr waye streyght to Ardeyne. And whan the barons heard Charlemayne speake so: they tooke on theyr way without any more taryinge towarde Ardein and rode so longe tyll that they cam to mountarg weil, y<SUP>t</SUP> was not ferre from Ardeyne, for men might see from thens the steples of the towne There was lodged the hoste of char¦lemayne that nyght, and I promise he did doo make good watche, for doubt of the foure sonnes of Aymon And whā the day was come Charle¦mayne did set his folke in good orde∣naunce, &amp; with his baner dysplayed they rode towarde Ardeyne. And whan Reynawde wyst that Charle∣maine was come for to besiege them within Ardeyn: he began to swere y<SUP>t</SUP> he should not let him besieged as he had doone within Mountawban. For rather he wolde fight w<SUP>t</SUP> Char∣lemayne. And if it may so falle that he come in his handes: he shall not haue pitie of him as he had to fore tyme bycause he had founde him so cruell and without pitie. Brother sayde then Rycharde now I see you speake like a knight, and by y<SUP>e</SUP> fayth
<PB N="cxxxi" REF="136"/> that I owe vnto you I promise you y<SUP>t</SUP> or euer Charlemayne shall besiege vs: I shall slea more than an hūdred of his folke, and but yf god fayle vs we shall doo suche a thing that shal be to the great hurte &amp; dyspleasure of hym, wherof he shalbe sory all the dayes of his life. For he is not ma∣nered like a gentilmā. For the more that he is prayed the lesse he dooth. Brother sayd Alarde ye speake wel and honestlye. And I shall con you thanke for it as longe as I lyue.</P>
<P>YE ought to wyt y<SUP>t</SUP> whan Rey∣nawde saw Charlemayne com for to besyege him with a greate pu∣issaunce of folke, he was nothing a∣basshed with it, but he made inconti∣nēt Bondy his good horne to be blo∣wen, and made his folke to be arry∣ued redely that were in great num∣bre and made them yssue out of the Citie. And whan his army was as∣sēbled in the feeldes: it was a noble thynge for to see, and than he ordey∣ned hys batayles bi good ordenaūce as a wise fighter. And after he had doone so: he called his brethern and sayde to them. My fayre bretherne this daye is the day that we shal die or els doo so muche that we shall bringe the warre at an ende. Wher∣fore I pray you y<SUP>t</SUP> euery of vs shewe hym selfe a good knight, for in you is all my truste, and so I promyse you that I haue leuer di worthely in batayle, than for to be hanged sham∣fully as theefe My brethern I praye you come all nighe me. For I wyll that we ben the fyrst that smite vpō our enemies. Brother sayde Alarde we shall doo your commaundement doubt ye not of it, and go forth whā ye wyll, and whā they were so agreed Reynawde did choose an hundred of the best knightes of his felawshyp, and sayde to theym. Syrs I praye you that ye wyll be wyth me in the fyrste batayle, and ye shall doo me great honoure. Syr sayde the knigh∣tes, we shall gladlye doo your com∣maundement, and we shall not leue you as longe as life is in vs, and so we thanke you of the great worshyp that ye doo call vs in your company for ye knowe well that wee canne not fare amys as longe as wee be wyth you.</P>
<P>WHan Reynawde had or∣deyned wel hys batayles he made none other tary∣enge, but wente the formest of all, y<SUP>e</SUP> sheelde at the necke, and the spere in the fyst &amp; was mounted vpon Bay∣arde, that beheld proudly about him makynge greate noyse. And then Reynawde gaue him the spurre, and went fayre vpon the folke of the Kynge Charlemayne, and whan Charlemaayne saw Bayarde rem∣ynge that made so great bruyte, and Reynawde vpon his backe y<SUP>t</SUP> cam in so fayre ordenaunce: he was sore a¦basshed of it, and sayd in him self. O good Lorde, and where the Deuyll haue all redy had the foure Sonnes of Aymō so many folke as I se here now come with them. I beleue tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it is some deuylles werke. For I had
<PB REF="137"/> not left many with them late a goe. And now Reynawde is so puyssaūt that he feareth me nothyng. But I promise god all this shal not auayle hym nothynge, but I shal doo iustice vpon him and his brethern or ought longe. And than he made his bataile to set in ordenaunce in the best wyse that he coulde, and lighted on horse∣backe for to come fyght wyth Rey∣nawde, And whan the Duke Nay∣mes saw that Charlemayn was so mad y<SUP>t</SUP> he wolde goe fight with Rey∣nawde: he went to hym &amp; sayde syr, what is that ye will doo? I pro∣myse you it were greate folye for to fight with these folke, &amp; it were bet∣ter that ye made peace w<SUP>t</SUP> Reynawd, For I am sure that Reynawde shal doo all y<SUP>t</SUP> ye wil cōmaunde him, and I tell you wel y<SUP>t</SUP> if we fight with thē: that ye shall see manye knyghtes to trayle theyr bowelles thorough the feelde, wherof it shalbe great harme to the one party, and to the other.</P>
<P>And suche shall y<SUP>e</SUP> losse be that it shal not be recouered agayne. Naymes sayd the kinge Charlemayne let vs alone, for I shal doo none other wise for no man that liueth, I should ra∣ther let me to be dismembred. And whan the duke Naymes had vnder∣stande his wordes: he was ful sory of it and left his speaking therof, &amp; from that houre Charlemayne dely∣bered hymselfe for to fyght, and al∣wayes he rode forth in great wrath.</P>
<P>ANd whan Reynawde sawe that the two hostes were ap∣proched sore nighe thone the other, as to hande and hāde: he sayd to his brother Rychard that was next him, I wil go speake with the king Char∣lemayne for to wyt of hym yf he wil pardon and take vs vnto hys grace For yf he wolde doo so: I should doo entierly all his wil and pleasure as to our souerayne lorde. By god bro∣ther sayd then Rycharde, yee be not worthe a botell of hey, for the herte is all redy fayled in your bely. Goe forth mischaūt sayd then Reynawde thou wot not what thou sayest. For I wyll go there no man shall keep me therfro, &amp; if he refuseth the peace whan I shall axe it of hym: I shall make myne auowe to God that I shall neuermore require him therof. Brother sayd Alarde ye say wel and wisely, go there hardly and doo ther∣in your wyll. And than Reynawde made none other delayinge, but he smote Bayarde with the spurres, and went incontinent towarde the kynge Charlemayne, &amp; sayd than to hym. Syr for gods mercy suffre if it be your pleasure that we haue peace and accorded with you, y<SUP>t</SUP> this warre that hath lasted so longe maye: finis∣she, and that your wrath be put awai from vs if it please you, and I shall be redy to doo all that ye wyll, and also I shall gyue you Bayarde my good horse. Than sayd the kynge to hym, goe fro me false gloton, the de∣uyll speed thee, for al the worlde shal not conne keep thee but I shall slea thee. Syr sayd Reynawde ye shal not doo so, and god wyll, for I shall de∣fend me well. And wit it sith that it is com to this: ye shal not be spared of vs, but we shall doo the worste y<SUP>t</SUP> we can. Smite knightes sayde the
<PB N="Cxxxii" REF="137"/> kynge Charlemaine, I shall neuer prayse you if this euil glotton scape me now. And whā that Reynawde sawe thys: he sayde. Syr kinge of Fraunce I defie you, and forthwith he spurred Baiarde, and ranne with his spere vpon a knight, whyche he smote so harde in the br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st that he o∣uerthrew hym dead vnto the erthe. And after that he went agayne vnto his folke. And whan that the kinge Charlemayn saw this: he cried wan hye voyce smite knightes now shall they ben discomfyted.</P>
<P>THan whan Rowland hearde the kynge Charlemayne crie thus: he spurred his horse and went after Reynawde, &amp; also many other knyghtes, but they ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r tooke hym not. Whā Rycharde saw his brother come: he came hym agaynst &amp; sayde to him. Brother what tidinges brīg you? shal wee haue peace or warre? B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>other sayd Reynawde let vs doo the best that wee can doo, for peace we shal not haue. Brother sayd then Rychard god blesse you for the tidin∣ges that ye brynge, for I thynke to doo this day suche a thynge, wher∣of king Charlemayne shalbe angry. Brother said Reynawde I pray you that ye shewe yourselfe vertuous &amp; stronge agaynst our enemyes. Whan the king Charlemayne sawe that it was time to set vpon him he called hastely the duke Naymes and sayde to hym. Naymes hold my Oriflam and thynke for to smite wel and va¦liauntly as a worthy knight ought for to doo at eyther hande in keeping my worship, and herof I praye you hertely. Syr sayd the duke Naymes ye need not for to pray me, for I am boūde for to doo the same, but it gre∣ueth me that ye haue not done other wise, that is for to sai that ye should haue graunted to the peace, for the warre hath lasted to longe. Naimes I commaunde you that ye speake no more therof vnto me, for while I li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> they shall haue no peace with me.</P>
<P>Syr sayd the Duke Naymes I am sory for it. Now let see what ye shall doo, for I goe to batayle fyrst of all, and looke that ye folow me yf ye will for I shall put me in suche a place wherof ye shalbe sore meruayled, &amp; not without a cause, for there hys no man so colde, but he should soone get here there within a litle whyle, Frow folow that wyll.</P>
<P>ANd whan Reynawde saw y<SUP>e</SUP> Oriflam of Fraunce come: he broched Bayarde wyth the spur∣res, and ranne amonge the thickest, and smote a knight so harde that he cast hym downe vnto the erth. And after he turned him toward his folk &amp; chered thē honestly, &amp; than wente aga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne vpon his enemyes, and of them he ouerthrew foure one after an other, and vpon the fyft he brake his spere into two peeces, and hur∣ted hym ryght sore, and anon he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hande to flamberge his good swerde and smote a knyght withall vpon his helme so great stroke that he cle∣ued him vnto the harde teeth, and forth with he smote another with su∣che strength that he made flee y<SUP>e</SUP> head from the body of hym. And after y<SUP>t</SUP> he had doone these two strokes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB REF="138"/> cryed Ardeyn as hye as he could for to reioyse his folke, and whā he had cryed so: he sayd to them. Now vpō them good knightes, for this day we shal auenge the great shame y<SUP>e</SUP> Char¦lemayne hath doone to vs so longe wythout any reason. And whan A∣larde, Guycharde &amp; Rycharde heard Reynawde speake thus: they ranne vpon theyr enemies by suche a ma∣ner that eache of thē ouerthrew .vii. knightes at y<SUP>e</SUP> enpraynte, who that had be there than he should haue sene great faytes of armes doone of the foure sonnes of Aymon, For after y<SUP>t</SUP> they were ones assembled together: the folke of the kinge Charlemayne myght not endure afore them. For Reinawde and hys brethern wente smytynge at eyther hande, and felled theyr enemies downe sterke dead as beastes, so that the moste part of thē were slayne or dyscomfited.</P>
<P>WHan the Kynge Charlemaine sawe the great dommage that the foure sonnes of Aymon bare to him: he was right sore an angred for it. And wyth great wrathe he wente and ranne vpon the folke of Rey∣nawde and smote a knyght so venge¦ably that he cast hym downe dead to the erth, and brake his speare all in peeces. And after he tooke his swerd in his hande, wherof he did meruay∣les of armes, so muche that his folk praysed hym for it, for he bare hym∣selfe there valyaūt and stronge. And wyt that this meruaylous batayle was so cruell that it was great py∣tie for to see. ¶ It is trouth y<SUP>t</SUP> Row∣land was aferde for his vncle char∣lemayne that he should be ouerthro∣wē whā he saw him in y<SUP>e</SUP> prese, wher¦fore he went anon nyghe him, and so dyd Oliuer, Ogyer and all the .xii. peeres for to keep y<SUP>t</SUP> he should haue no harme. And whan the great ba∣tayles were assēbled the one against the other: ye should haue seen there a sharpe and a heauy batayle so that it was pitie for to see, for syth y<SUP>t</SUP> Row∣lande, Oliuer and all the .xii. peeres of Fraunce were come in the medle: they began to make so great slaugh∣ter of the folke of Reynawde y<SUP>t</SUP> they made them leaue the place. And whā Reynawde and his brethern saw y<SUP>t</SUP>: they medled them so sharply among the Frenche men y<SUP>t</SUP> euery man made them waye, for they raught no man but they threw hym dead to the erth so muche that there was nothynge but it trembled afore them, ye ou∣ght to wyt that from the houre of pryme vnto the houre of noone en∣dured this mortall batayle, that no∣ne wyst who should haue the better of it. But whan noone was passed: the folke of Reynawde beganne to wyth drawe themselfe, for they mi∣ght no more. And for to saye the trouth yf the folke of Reynawde w<SUP>t</SUP>∣drew them: they were not to be bla∣med for it, for Charlemayne had foure tymes moe folke than Rey∣nawde beside y<SUP>e</SUP> .xii. peeres that were suche knightes as men wel knewe. But this that the folke of Reynawd dyd: Was for the good ensample that they sawe in Reynawde &amp; in his bre∣thern. And whan the noble knyght perceyued that hys folke withdrewe themselfe: he came to hym that bare
<PB N="Cxxxiii" REF="138"/> his standarde and sayde to hym. My freende ride towarde Ardeine in the wysest wise that ye can, for this day we haue fought ryght sore, and it is tyme that we goe rest ourselfe. Syr sayde the knyght I shall well doo your commaundement, and inconti∣nent he tooke his way towarde Ar∣deyn. And than Reinawde called his brethern and sayde to them, let vs be behinde for to keep our folke, for o∣therwyse we are lost. Brother sayde Rycharde doubt not, for as longe as god giueth lyfe to you &amp; to Bayard: We need not feare nothynge.</P>
<P>WHan Charlemayne saw that Reynawde and all his com∣pany was gone: he cryed wyth a hye voyce, nowe after Lordes after for now ben they dyscomfyted. But this worde of Charlemayne was cause that many a worthy knyght lost his lyfe. For suche dyd folow after Rey∣nawde that payed deerely for it. For Reynawde and his brethern slewe more than an hundred that folowed after them. And wolde Charlemain or no. Reynawde and his bretherne entred agayne with their folke with in Ardeyne. And ye muste knowe y<SUP>t</SUP> Rycharde the brother of Reynawde: Iusted with Richarde the Duke of Normandye by the gate of Ardeyne as they wolde haue entred in. And there the Duke was ouerthrowen, the whiche was taken prysoner by Rycharde the brother of Reynawde, and brought him into the Citie maw¦gre the folke of Charlemayne. And whan Reynawde and all the folke were within Ardeyne: he made the gates to be shet. And after went, and dysarmed thē for to take some ease. For they had well need therof.</P>
<P>YE ought to wit y<SUP>e</SUP> whan Char∣lemayne saw that the foure sō∣nes of Aymon had saued them self, and that thei had taken Richarde the Duke of Normandy prysoner that was one of the .xii. peeres: he was s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> angrye that no man can be more, for he feared sore lest Reynawde should make to dye Rychard of nor¦mandye, and whan he sawe that he might doo none other: he commaun¦ded that the Citie should be besieged of all sydes, the which thing was in∣continent doone as he commaunded And than sware Charlemayne that he should neuer leaue his syege vnto the tyme that he had taken the Citie and the foure sonnes of Aymon to be hanged shamfully. Syr sayd Row¦lande ye know that I am he y<SUP>t</SUP> moste hath hurted the foure sonnes of Ay∣mon, nor neuer I speake to you of peace bewene you and them, but frō hence foorth reason cōmaundeth me y<SUP>t</SUP> I should speke &amp; moue there vnto. Syr ye know well that it is a go .xv yeres and more that ye haue warred with the foure sonnes of Aymon, &amp; we had alwaies y<SUP>e</SUP> worse of the warre and not wythout a cause, for Rey∣nawde &amp; his brethern are valiaunt knightes, nor they be not to be lyght¦ly brought to dyscomfiture. And I promyse you yf ye had warred so lōg vpon the sarasyns as ye haue doone on the foure sonnes of Aymon: yee should haue be lorde of y<SUP>e</SUP> moste part of them, whiche had be to you more
<PB REF="139"/> worshyp and lesse dommage, &amp; worse is: ye know howe Richarde of Nor∣mandy one of the best knightes that ye had: is taken, and yf otherwise it happeth to hym than well: it shall be to you great dyshonour and blame. For therof ye shall see all Fraunce in a rore and trouble, but if ye put som remedy therto, &amp; I tell you if I were in the case that Reynawde is in: I should slea hym. Syth that I might haue no peace wyth you. Wherfore syr yf ye wyll beleue me for your ho∣nour and for your profit: ye shal sēd worde to Reynawde that he delyuer you agayne Rycharde of Norman∣dye all armed vpon his horse, and ye shall make peace wyth hym, and I promyse you syr he shall doo it glad∣ly wyth all that ye wyl commaunde hym and so shall all hys brethern al∣so. Rowland sayd than the king, wil ye say any thing more. Nay syr sayd Rowlande. And I sweare you vpon my fayth that the foure Sonnes of Aymon shall neuer haue peace with me, and so I tel you y<SUP>t</SUP> I feare me not for Rycharde of Normādy, for Rey∣nawde should rather put out bothe his owne eyen thā that he durst doo to Rycharde any harme vpon his bo¦dy. And whan y<SUP>e</SUP> barons heard Char∣lemayne speake so: the teares began to fal downe frō theyr eyen for great feare that Richarde of Normandye theyr Peere should haue any harme. After all these thynges Reynawde and his bretherne were wythin Ar∣deyne making great Ioy. And after they were all out of theyr harneys: Reynawde ordeyned good watche vpon the walles of the Citie. And than he made come the duke Richar∣de of Normandy afore hym, &amp; sayde to him in thys maner. Duke richard ye know wel that the king doth great wronge for to trouble vs so as he hath doone, and yet dooth withoute any resonable cause. And therfore I tell you for certayne, but yf that ye make vs to haue peace: thinke not to lyue onye lenger, for I shall doo smyte of your head and your body to be hewed in foure quarters. Sir said the duke Richarde of Normandye, I am in your daunger, so maye ye doo of me your pleasure. Ye haue taken me by warre, and none otherwyse: yf ye doo to me otherwyse than ye ou∣ght of ryght of warre, ye shall haue dysshonour for euer more. And so I wyll wel that ye know that as long as I liue: I shall not fayle Charle∣mayne for no feare of death. Whan Reynawde hearde Richarde of Nor∣mandye speake thus: he refrayned a lytle his wrathe, and than he com∣maūded y<SUP>t</SUP> he should be put in yrons within his chābres, and y<SUP>t</SUP> he should be well kept and curteysly, and that he be well serued of that appertey∣neth to hys estate. Than was the Duke Rycharde all thus in prison: but he was well serued of all good meates, and he had good companye for to playe to what game that he wolde. And also the good Duchesse clare dyd vysite him often, and recō∣forted hym with her fayre langage.</P>
<P>WHan Charlemaine had bese∣ged the Citie rounde aboute and sawe that by no sawtynge, he myght not get it: he dyd doo make
<PB N="cxxxiiii" REF="139"/> many great engynes for to cast sto∣nes in, but what someuer y<SUP>t</SUP> he dyd: Reynawde and his brethern and al∣so his folke yssued out often, as well by night as by day vpon the folke of the king Charlemayne, and did him great domage, for Reynawde tooke no man but he kept him prisoner, for to see yf he myght haue peace wyth Charlemayne, by meanes of them.</P>
<P>And whyle that Charlemayne had layde his siege thus afore Ardeyne: the king Yon of gascoygne fell sike a bed of a great sickenes, &amp; shrofe hym of al his sinnes praying god to haue pitie and mercy on hym, and after he had be longe sycke he died. God par∣don hys soule. And wyt that Rey∣nawde made hym be buryed wor∣shypfully, as to a kinge perteyneth, but there was no man that wept for hym, for all they of the Citie hated hym, bycause of the greate treason y<SUP>t</SUP> he had doone to the foure sonnes of Aymon. ¶ Now leueth the hystorye to speake of this mater, &amp; returneth to speake of Mawgis that was in his hermitage y<SUP>t</SUP> serued our lorde w<SUP>t</SUP> good herte, so muche that he had for∣goten Reynawde, his brethern &amp; hys freendes.</P>

<P>NOw sheweth the history that whan Mawgys was in his hermitage, &amp; had watched so longe about hys prayers to God: he fell a slepe, and him semed in his slepe that he was at Mountawban and sawe Reynawde and his brethern y<SUP>t</SUP> came agaynst him, and made theyr com∣playnt
<PB REF="140"/> to hym of Charlemayne that wolde take fro them the good horse Bayarde, but Reynawde had hym fast by the brydle, and wolde not let it goe. And wit it that Mawgys had so great sorow in his dreame: that he a woke withall al wrothe, and arose on his feete incontinent. And than he sware our Lorde he should neuer ceasse to goe tyll he had seen Reyna∣wde and hys brethern his good co∣syns. And whan Mawgis had said so: he made none other tarying, but he shet the doore of hys chapell, and tooke his weede and hys staffe, and went on his waye also soone as he myght. And about y<SUP>e</SUP> houre of noone he founde hymselfe in a great wood where he founde two men makyng euyll cheere and great sorow, &amp; whā Mawgys sawe them: he cam to thē and sayd? God be with you. And one of them answered and sayd, certes god is not with vs: but rather the de¦uyll, for vnhappy was that houre y<SUP>t</SUP> euer we came into this wood, for we ben vndoone for euer. Good Syrs sayde Mawgys what eyleth you y<SUP>t</SUP> ye speake so. Good man sayd y<SUP>e</SUP> one of the two, a litle before you: are the∣ues y<SUP>t</SUP> hath robbed vs of our clothe and haue slayne one of our felawes bycause he speake to them angrely. Whan Mawgys heard theese poore marchaūt{is} speke thus: he had great pitie of them and sayd to them. My freendes come with me, I shal pray the theeues in our Lordes behalfe y<SUP>t</SUP> they wyll delyuer you agayne your goodes, and yf they wil not doo it: I shall be wrothe with thē, &amp; so I shall fight w<SUP>t</SUP> thē wel as I can w<SUP>t</SUP> my staffe for to wit yf theyr heades ben soft or harde. Whan the marchaūtes hearde Mawgis say so: they began to looke vpon hym if they could know him, but they might not knowe what he was. Then spake to hym one of thē in this maner, and what deuyll is that ye say? thou art but a man alo∣ne all naked and they ben all armed and also ye can scantlye heaue vp your staffe. Let this foole alone sayd that other, see ye not howe his eyen goe in his head? And than they sayd to Mawgys. Brother go thy wayes and let vs in peace, or els I shal giue thee suche a stroke w<SUP>t</SUP> this same stafe y<SUP>t</SUP> thou shalt feele it well. And whan Mawgys saw the marchaunt speke thus to him: he sayde. Brother thou dooste not wel to speake to me so, for by force thou cannot get ought of me. And thus departed Mawgys from the marchauntes, &amp; went hys way so muche y<SUP>t</SUP> he ouertooke y<SUP>e</SUP> thee∣ues and sayd to them. Lordes God saue you. I pray you tell me whye ye take a way y<SUP>e</SUP> goods from these mar¦chauntes? ye know well y<SUP>t</SUP> it is not yours, wherfore I pray you let thē haue agayne theyr goodes and their marchaūdise, &amp; god shall conne you thanke. Whan y<SUP>e</SUP> theeues heard maw¦gis speake to them thus: they were angry for it. And behelde vpon maw¦gis from ouer the shoulder as he had be a Sarasyn. Thenne spake the Mayster of the Theeues and sayde th{us} to Mawgys. Go away horeson or els I shall gyue thee suche a stro∣ke with my foote that I shall brest

And whan Mawgis heard this and knew that the theues feared nother god nor hys mother: he was ryght an angred, &amp; heued vp his palmers stafe &amp; smote the mayster theefe with al vpon his head so stronglye that he caste hym downe dead to the groūde. And whā the other theues saw their mayster dead: they ranne all to Mawgys to haue killed hym, but Mawgys are∣ched them so with his st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffe that he slew fiue of them within a litle while and than the other tweyne began to flee away through the wood.

And whan the Marchauntes hearde Mawgys crye thus: they came incontinent to∣warde hym, and they found that the theues that had robbed theym were dead. And than they sayd the one to the other, heere is a good Pylgrym. I ween it is my lorde saynt Martin</P>
<P>ANd whan the marchauntes saw this that Mawgys had doone: they were right glad of it. So came they towarde Mawgys and kneeled before hym and cryed mercy of that they had said to him. Lordes sayd Mawgys yf ye gaue me greate wordes: so dyd the theeues muche more. For they called me rybaude truant and horeson, but they haue bought it rig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t deere as ye may see. &amp; I am right sory that two of them are scaped from me. Stande vp thā &amp; take with you your goodes agayn and god be with you, but I pray you tell me or ye go yf ye wot not, where is Charlemayne. Syr sayd the mar∣chauntes, we wot wel that Charle∣maine hath taken Moūtawban, but we promyse you he hath not yet ta∣ken none of the foure sonnes of Ay∣mon: for they were gone out w<SUP>t</SUP> their folke through a caue vnder the erth, that they found vnder the walles of the Castel vnto the Citie of Ardeyn where as they ben now. And Charle∣mayne hath layde there his syege a∣fore them, &amp; will not make no peace with Reynawde nor wyth his bre∣thern. Certes sayd Mawgys I am sory for thē, for they ben good knigh¦tes and true. Whan Mawgis vnder stoode that Charlemayne had besye∣ged Reynawde within Ardeyn: he cō¦mended the marchauntes to God &amp; tooke his way towarde Ardeyn, and so muche he went that he came into the hoste of Charlemayne, and went streyght towarde the Citie, &amp; made semblaunt to be sore feble, for he wēt lenynge vpon his staffe. And whan the folke of the kynge Charlemayne sawe Mawgys goe thus: they loo∣ked sore vpō him and sayd thone to the other, that pilgrim is lyke for to goe ferre, he cannot stande vpon his feete. By my othe sayd another it might well be Mawgis that is so dysguysed, for to dysceyue vs. It is not so said y<SUP>e</SUP> other. Mawgis is not aliue. And while y<SUP>t</SUP> thei deuised thus together: Mawgys came neere to y<SUP>e</SUP> wicket of the gate, and founde the meanes that he gat in anon. And whan he was within Ardeyn: he wēt vnto the Palays. Where he founde
<PB REF="141"/> Reynawde and the duchesse his wife and bothe theyr children Aymonet and Yonnet, and their vncles his co¦sins, w<SUP>t</SUP> a great meyny of noble kni∣ghtes that were all at theyr meate. Whan Mawgis had looked a while vpon them, he lened agaynst a piller that was in the middes of the halle afore Reynawde. Than began he to looke agayne vpon his fayre cosyns y<SUP>t</SUP> he loued so muche aboue all thinge of the worlde. And whan the Mar∣shall of the halle saw Mawgys, we∣ning to him y<SUP>t</SUP> it had be a poore here∣mite: he commaunded that he should be serued of his dinner for Goddes sake. And whan Mawgis sawe the meat that was brought him, he said my lordes I beseche you for the loue of God that it wil please you for to bringe me some browne bread and water in a trene disshe, and thus I shalbe serued as vnto me appertey∣neth. For I dare not take none other meat. And whan y<SUP>e</SUP> stewarde of Rey∣nawde saw that, he made him anon to be brought al that he wolde haue. Than tooke Mawgys the browne bread and made soppes in water, &amp; eate of it with a good appetite. And whan y<SUP>t</SUP> Reynawde sawe thys poore man afore him that liued so poorely and was so lene and so pale: he had of him great pitie. So tooke he a dishe that was before him that was full of venyson, and sent it to hym bi a squier of his that presented it to hym sayinge thus, holde good man the duke sendeth you this, god yelde him sayd Mawgys, and than he too∣ke and set the dysshe afore hym, but he eat nothing of it. And whan Rey∣nawde sawe that: he was greatlye meruailed, &amp; said to hī self. god who is that good man that liueth so hard a life, if he were not so leue: I should say that it were my good cosin maw¦gys, but a nother thing sheweth me that it is not he. For he wolde not hyde hymselfe from me in no wyse.</P>
<P>REynawde behelde stil Maw∣gys so muche that he left his mete for to looke vpō him. And whā the tables were taken vp, &amp; that e∣uery man had eaten at his ease: they went to their warde for to defende the towne as they were wonte for to doo, in theyr harneys. And whā Rey¦nawde sawe that euerye man was gone, and that there was no body w<SUP>t</SUP> in the halle for whome he wolde leue for to say hys will: he went to maw∣gys and sayd to hym, good heremite I pray you for the reuerence of that God that ye serue that ye tell me yf ye be Mawgys or no, for ye are well lyke him. Whā Mawgys heard Rei∣nawd speake thus to hym: he could hide himselfe no lenger, and sayd al on hye. Cosyn I am Mawgys wythout doubt. I am com to see you and I am glad that I see you and also al your brethern in good plight And whan Reynawde vnderstoode y<SUP>t</SUP> it was his cosin y<SUP>t</SUP> he loued moste of all the men in the worlde, &amp; that had kept him diuese times from pe∣rill and daunger, he had not ben so glad yf men had gyuen him the half of al the worlde. So wente he and kissed him more than a hundred ty∣mes, and after he said to him in this
<PB N="cxxxvi" REF="141"/> maner. Fayre cosyn I pray you that ye wyl doo of this cope that ye were vpon you. For my eyen cannot see you thus poorely arayed. Than an∣swered Mawgis to hym and sayde, My cosyn be not displeased of that I shal tel you, ye must wyt that I haue made my vow to god that I shal ne∣uer eate but alonly breade and wilde herbes and that to my drynke I shal take none other but water, and that I shal neuer weare the dayes of my lyfe none other clothes but suche as this is, for I haue giuen my self vt∣terly to serue and loue our blessed sa¦uiour &amp; hys glorious mother, for to brynge my soule to saluacyon in the blysse that euer shall laste.</P>
<P>WHan Reynawde hearde his Cosyn Mawgis speke thus: he was in a thought whether it was Mawgys or no, for he coulde not knowe hym well bycause he was so sore apayred of his person. And be∣gan to looke well vpon him agayn, and he should neuer haue knowen him if it had not be a litle liste that he had by hys right eye. And after y<SUP>t</SUP> he had verye knowledge of hym: he made greate ioye for hym. And he prayde hym agayne sayinge in this wyse. Fayre Cosin I pray you for y<SUP>e</SUP> loue of the fayth that ye owe to me that ye wyl tell me the trouth of that I shal aske you. Syr sayd Mawgis I shall tell it you gladly. Cosyn said Reynawde I wolde wyt where yee haue be euer syth that ye went from me, &amp; fro whens ye come nowe Syr sayd Mawgis sythe it please you to wyt of my lyuynge: I shall shew it you with a good wyll, yee ought to knowe my fayre cosyn for certayne y<SUP>t</SUP> I haue made my selfe an hermite, &amp; I haue left the worlde for to serue hym that made me, &amp; the blessed vyr∣gyn Marye his mother, for to haue pardon of my synnes that I haue doone in my lyfe, for I haue doone many great euilles agaynst my crea¦tour, &amp; by me are dead so many folke wherof I knowe that our Lorde is greatly wrothe agaynst me. After y<SUP>t</SUP> Reynawde had hearde Mawgys speake thus: he had so great pity on him that the teres fell alonge hys chekes fro his eyen for loue of hys good cosyn. And than he called hys brethern &amp; sayd to them, come hyther my bretherne &amp; ye shal se your cosyn Mawgys. And whan Alarde, Guy∣charde, &amp; Richarde, heard these wor∣des: their hertes rose in their belyes for ioye and ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> all to Mawgys &amp; kyssed him ful sweetly. And whan y<SUP>e</SUP> duchesse wyste that Mawgys was come: she cam anon there as he was and kissed hym weepyng ful sore for ioy that she had to see hym. And thā came there Aymonet &amp; Yonnet that made great Ioye, &amp; welcomed hym. And thorowe all the citie was anon knowen the coming of the valiaunt Mawgis, wherof many folke cam to see him. But he was so chaunged and so apayred that it was pitie for to see. Thus was Reynawde well glad of y<SUP>e</SUP> cominge of his good cosyn &amp; after y<SUP>t</SUP> they had made greate Ioye a longe whyle: Reynawde called his brother Richarde and sayd to hym, Brother go fet anon a good gown<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for our Cosyn Mawgys, and let
<PB REF="142" MS="y"/> him be brought a payre of shone that ben wyne ynoughe, for I know wel that his feete ben sore, &amp; than he said to his wyfe. Lady arise, and fet hym suche lennen as he nedeth. Syr sayd she he shall haue of the best ynoughe anon. And whā Mawgis heard this worde he sayd to Reynawde. Syr I tell you truly that I haue sworne y<SUP>t</SUP> I shall neuer weare shone nor lin∣nen clothes aboute me. But doo to me if it please you to giue me a new slop and a large hoode, a palster wel yrende and a male, and therwith yee shal well contente me. And than I shal comende you to god, and I shal go my way, for I am not comē heere but only for to see you, wherof my desyre was sore set vnto. Right sory was Reinawde whā he heard maw∣gys say so, in so muche that almoste he was swouning for sorowe. Rey∣nawde sayd thā Mawgis leue your sorow, for I haue gyuen my self to god vtterly for to brynge my soule to blesse of heuen, and so wyll I goe to the holy lande for to serue to the tē∣ple of Iherusalem, and for to vysite the holy sepulcre of our lorde. And whan I haue doone so I shal come agayne to se you and God spare me my life, and than I shal go agayn to mine hermitage, and shal lyue there as a beast with rootes and w<SUP>t</SUP> wylde herbes as I dyd before that I came heere. Whan Reynawde heard thys he was sory for it, &amp; sayd to Maw∣gis in this wise. Fayre cosin for god take with you a good horse and mo∣ney ynough. For ye shal haue al this of me. Holde your peace said Maw∣gis I wil not therof, for whā I haue brede it is to me ynoughe, for al my hope is in God, to whome I pray that I may come agayne whole and sounde.</P>
<P>AFter all these thynges thus sayd Mawgys prayed Rey∣nawde that he wolde make haste to make hym be deliuered, suche thin∣ges as he had desyred of hym. And Reynawde dyd so syth y<SUP>t</SUP> he myght not make hym to take none other thynge with hym. And whan y<SUP>e</SUP> mo∣row cam, and that Mawgis had his newe sloppe and his hoode, he tooke hys palster and his new male y<SUP>t</SUP> Rei∣nawde had giuen him, he went and hearde masse, and after the masse he tooke his leaue of euery one, &amp; went on his way. And Reynawde cōueied him vnto the wieket of the gate of y<SUP>e</SUP> Citie and kissed him: and in likewise dyd all his bretherne, and also y<SUP>e</SUP> du∣chesse Clare and her chyldren. And whan they had all kyssed Mawgys he commended them to God &amp; went out of the towne, and went forth the ryght waye. But he was not ferre gone whan he was aduyrōned roūd about him with the folke of y<SUP>e</SUP> kyng Charlemayne. And the one sayd to the other: heere is the hermite that we saw yesterday but he is now bet∣ter clothed than he was at that time It might be well Mawgys y<SUP>e</SUP> cosyn of Reynawde that hath mocked vs diuerse times, certes sayde the other it is he verelye, let vs slea hym, and we shall doo well, we shall not sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> some: for thys man semeth to be an hundred yere olde.

All thus as these folke sayd these wordes, Maw∣gis heard al that they sayd and held his peace and went on his way styl thoroughe the hoste without any let∣tynge of any man. ¶ Here leueth the hystory to speake of Mawgys, that went into the holy lande, and retur∣neth to speake of Charlemayne that had besyeged Ardeyn bycause that Reynawde and hys brethern were wythin.</P>

</FIGURE></P>
<P>IN this party sheweth that the kyng Charlemayne was at y<SUP>e</SUP> syege of Ardeyn sore an angred that he myght not know howe Rychard of Normandy dyd. So sent he for all hys Barons for, to come to hym: And whan they were come in his pauillion, he sayd to them thus Lordes I see wel that it goeth now yll with me, bycause I see that Rey¦nawde
<PB REF="143"/> hath not sent me agayne Ri∣charde of Normandy, and he might well haue delyuerd hym free &amp; quite and haue sende hym vnto me for all the harmes y<SUP>t</SUP> he hath doone to me. Vncle sayde Rowlande I merueyll greatly of that ye saye, ye shew wel to vs that ye be wythout counsell. By the fayth that I owe to you, ye shal neuer see Richarde of Norman∣dye, but yf ye pardon Reynawde &amp; his brethern, diuerse times he hath meked himselfe vnto you, and hath be alwayes redy to fulfyll your ple∣sure, &amp; ye wyll not take hym to your grace, be not than merueyled if Rei∣nawde shewe nowe some dispite a∣gaynst you. For and ye consider wel the great curtesie that he hath doone vnto you: namely whan he had you at his will within mountawban &amp; that he delyuered you, and suffred you goe quite and free fro him at your liberti, ye should doo for him o∣therwyse than ye doo, but syth that Reynawde seeth y<SUP>t</SUP> he may not finde no mercy in you: he wyll not leese his curtesye, but he shall doo y<SUP>e</SUP> wor∣ste that he can, as ye maye well per∣ceyue experience of it euery day, for he dōmageth vs dayly, and keepeth his prisoner the best knyght that yee had, that is Richarde y<SUP>e</SUP> duke of nor∣mandy, the whych I weene be dead by thys time. Neuew sayd the kinge Charlemayne, I promyse you that Reynawde hath not put hī to death but he kepeth hym wel at his ease &amp; with great honoure, syr said than y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Naymes. Syth that the wor∣des ben come to this: I must tel you my mynde. Syr yf Reynawde bea∣reth you dommage: ye cānot blame hym for it. For he hath prayed you so many times humbly that ye wold haue mercy on him and ye wolde ne¦uer heare hym, but ye haue alwayes shewed your selfe the moste proude kynge of the worlde agaynst hym, &amp; the moste angry, and ye wyll beleue no counsell, and so I tell you if Rei∣nawd hath not made to dye Richard of Normandy: he is the kyndest mā of the worlde. But I beleue better that he is dead than otherwyse: for no man heere can tell whether he be dead or a liue.</P>
<P>WHan the kyng Charlemayne heard y<SUP>e</SUP> Duke Naymes speke thus: he knew wel that he tolde hym trouth. So began he to syghe sore, and to these wordes came forthe the Bysshop Turpin, &amp; Ogyer the dane that sayd in this maner. Sir wyt it verely that Naymes telleth you trouth. For Reynawde hath a good cause to be angrye wyth you. And whan Charlemayne heard his ba∣rōs speke thus: he was all abasshed of it. And called y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Naimes, the bisshop Turpyn, Ogier the Dane, &amp; Escouf the sonne of Oedon, &amp; sayde to them. Lordes I pray you goe to Ardeine &amp; tel Reynawde in my behalf y<SUP>t</SUP> he wil sende me Richarde of Nor∣mandy. And whan he hath doone so: y<SUP>t</SUP> he thā deliuer Mawgys into my handes for to doo my wyll of hym. And then he shall haue peace wyth me al the dayes of my lyfe. Deere syr
<PB N="Cxxxviii" REF="143"/> sayde the duke Naymes, ye sende vs for nought. For I wot wel y<SUP>e</SUP> Maw∣gis is gone from Reynawde, it is three yeres passed and more. And yf that Reynawde wolde delyuer him he may not. For he knoweth not him selfe where he is. Naymes sayd the king Charlemayne, yee shall at leste heare what Reynawde shal say vnto you, and ye shall also know how Ri∣charde of Normādi dooth. Syr sayd the duke Naymes, syth that it plea∣seth you that I shall goe: I am well contente, but I pray our Lorde that we maye returne agayne whole and sounde of our persones, without to be dyshonoured. whan the barons saw that kinge Charlemayne wolde that they should goe to Ardeyne for to doo his messager they durste not saye there agaynst. And so they wēt thether anon, and eche of them bare in his hande a braunche of an oliue tree in tooken of peace. And whan they came vnto the gate: they founde it open for them. For Reynawde had seen thē come from ferre. Wherfore he commaunded y<SUP>t</SUP> the wicket should be open. And whan the barons saw the litle gate open: they went into y<SUP>e</SUP> towne, and cam to the Palays. And whan Reynawde wyst y<SUP>t</SUP> they were come within the palays: he wēt and layde hymselfe downe vpon a bedde wyth hys legges crossed and sware God and his blessed mother that he should not praye the kinge Charle∣mayne of nothing. For he had doon him to great harme, for throughe the kynge Charlemayn: he had loste his good cosyn Mawgis and Moū∣tawban, that he loued so muche.</P>
<P>This hanginge: came there y<SUP>e</SUP> messa∣gers of the king Charlemaine, afore Reynawde. Whan the Duke Nay∣mes that was the formest saw Rey∣nawde: he saluted him honourably. And after he sayd to hym. Syr Rey∣nawde the kinge sendeth you worde by vs, that ye sende hym agayne Ri∣charde the duke of Normandy. And more ouer he sendeth you worde y<SUP>t</SUP> yf ye wyll delyuer him Mawgys: ye shal haue peace with him al y<SUP>e</SUP> dayes of his lyfe. And he shall deliuer you agayne all your landes. And he shal keep bothe your childrē in his court with him, and he shall make them knightes with his owne handes.</P>
<P>My Lordes sayde Reynawde, ye be ryght welcome to me as the knigh∣tes of y<SUP>e</SUP> worlde that I ought to loue best. But I meruayle me greatly of Charlemaine, that sendeth me these wordes, for eueri man knoweth wel that I haue not Mawgys. But by him I haue lost hym. And wolde to god that I had heere Charlemayn as wel as I haue Rycharde of Normā∣dye. And yf he wolde not graunt me peace with him. I promise you he should leaue his head for a pledge. So should I be than auenged of all y<SUP>e</SUP> great harmes &amp; dommages that he hath doone to me, syth that I haue be made knight of him. lordes I wēd that Charlemayne had be more cur∣toys then he is. For if I had wyll that he wolde haue ben so fell vpon me and my brethern: I should well auenged it vpon him. But it is to late to repente me that I did not so, wherfore that ye voyde out of my Palays, and goe tell your king that
<PB REF="144"/> I haue not Mawgys, but I haue loste hym for him, and also yf I had him he should not haue him. And bi∣cause I haue thus loste my good co∣syn Mawgys for hym: I shal make to morow Richarde the duke of Nor¦mandy to be hanged vpon the chefe gate of this Citie in y<SUP>e</SUP> dispite of him for no lenger respite he shal not haue of me, how be it that he is of my lig∣nage, and I tell you, come no more heere, nor no man of Charlemayne. For I promyse you I shall stryke of the heades of as many as shal come fro him to me without any fayle.</P>
<P>WHan Ogyer the Dane saw Reynawde so angry, &amp; that he answered so proudlye: he meruai∣led sore, aad drewe him selfe by Rey∣nawde, and said to him. Fayre cosin I pray you that ye will shewe to vs Rycharde of Normandy, to thende that we may tell Charlemayne that we haue seene hym. Ogyer I haue well vnderstande you sayde Rey∣nawde, but ye shall neuer see him a∣fore that I haue hanged hym, And yf Charlemayne be angry wyth me for it: let him auenge it yf he can, for I defie hym and all his pow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, and goe you hens anon. For by my soule if ye abide heere any lenger, it shall repent you full sore. And whan the barons saw that Reynawde was so feruently wrothe, they durst no len∣ger tary there: but tooke leue of him and went out of the Citie, and went lightly to the hoste of Charlemayne that awayted after them. Whan the kyng saw the Barons come: he said vnto them. Lordes ye be welcome. what tidynges brynge you? haue ye not seene Rycharde of Normandye? Syr sayde the Duke Naymes. Rey∣nawde doth you to wit that as loge as he maye ryde vpon Bayarde: yee shall not haue Mawgys, for he hath lost him by you. And for the venge∣aunce to be taken of the same: Rey∣nawde sēdeth you worde by vs that he shall hange to morow Rycharde of Normandye vpon the great gate of his towne, and thus shall he doo of all your mē that he shall take, and yet he sayth more, yf he had you as well as he hath Richarde of Normā¦die that if ye wolde not graunt him peace: yee should leaue wyth hym your head for a pledge. Whan Row∣land heard the worde that the Duke Naymes had reported vnto hys vn¦cle Charlemayne: he sayde. Syr be not displeased of that I shal tel you, me semeth that ye shall neuer see the duke Richarde, and al for your pride Syr we finde in holy scrypture that god curseth the fruite that neuer is ripe, thus shall it be by you y<SUP>t</SUP> neuer wyll rype nor condiscēde to no peace with the foure sōnes of Aymon, the best knightes of the worlde, y<SUP>t</SUP> so ma∣ny tymes haue prayed for it humbly and full piteously. Wherfore I swere to you vpon all halowes that yf the duke Rycharde of Normādy be han∣ged: ye shall lose honour &amp; worshyp all your lyfe dayes. Whan the kinge Charlemaine heard his neuew Row¦lande speake thus: that sayde y<SUP>t</SUP> Ry∣charde of Normandy should be han∣ged: he was so myscheuously an an∣gred that he gnewe the nailes of his handes, for great wrath, &amp; ye ought
<PB N="cxxxix" REF="144"/> to wit that Charlemayne was so an¦gry at that tyme, y<SUP>t</SUP> yf he had had any maner of staffe in his hād: he wolde haue gladly smitten Rowland, but whan he sawe that he might not ac∣complisshe his wil: he called his ba∣rons and sayde to them, Lordes ye wene to make me a ferde with your wordes, I am no childe for to be th{us} abasshed, and also I swere you by my fayth that if Reynawde were so hardy to doo anye harme vnto Ry∣charde of Normandy: I should hāg hym wyth myne owne handes, he &amp; all his lygnage that none should be left a lyue.</P>
<P>RYght sore wrothe was the king Charlemayne, whan he hearde tell that Reynawde wolde make Rycharde the duke of Normā∣die to be hanged. But whan Ogyer h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>de Charlemayne swere thus y<SUP>t</SUP> he should hang all the linage of rei∣nawde: he coulde not absteyne hym∣self but that the teares fel downe fro his eyen, and than he said to the bis∣shop Turpin. Sir what thynke you by our kynge that sayth by his great pride that he shall hange vs all? for al that he dooth procedeth but of en∣uye &amp; pryde, but god sende me death yf I care for hys wrathe, for yf Rey∣nawde hath not lied to vs: he shall doo be hanged to morowe Richarde of Normandy in such a place where as Charlemayne shall mow see him hange with his eyen. This hanging the Duke Naymes saw that y<SUP>e</SUP> king was angry, and he sayd to him. Sir wit that we all be sore abasshed that ye threre vs of one parte &amp; Reynawde of the other. And I meruaile me not of Reynawde, for he is so wroth rox bycause that ye haue make him lose Mawgys that no man might be more. And I promyse you for greate angre he shal make Rycharde of nor¦mandy to be hanged, and as to you namely he woulde stryke of your hed yf he had you in y<SUP>e</SUP> case that he hath Rycharde nowe, and yf he hangeth Richarde: What may we doo therto? that ye threten vs so muche therfore wherefore I counsell all my fela∣wes that are of the lynage of Rey∣nawde: that we goe our wayes and that we let you shift of the warre of the foure sonnes of Aimon. By god sayd y<SUP>t</SUP> other peeres of fraunce Nai∣mes speaketh well, and he giueth vs good counsell.</P>
<P>THen whan Charlemayne saw his barōs so sore moue he wyst not what he should doo, but gaue them leaue to withdraw them self vnto the morow that thei should returne to him, and he hymself went to his bed, but al night he could not fall a slepe: but w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tied in his bed w<SUP>t</SUP>∣out any rest, and wyste not what to doo. And whan y<SUP>e</SUP> day came: he a rose from his bedde, and sent for all hys barons, &amp; Whan they were come: he sayd to them. Lordes what shall we doo of Reynawde that wyl hange y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Richarde of Normandy afore mine eyen? Sir said thā y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Nai∣mes for nought seketh one coūsell y<SUP>t</SUP> wyll not put it to effect, whi aske ye counsell sythe that ye wyll doo no∣thing but after your owne head? but and ye wyll beleue me: I swere you

Naymes saide the king I wil not doo it, holde your peace therof, for that shalbe the laste worde that euer I shal say. Syr said Rowland by my soule ye doo great wronge yf ye suffre y<SUP>e</SUP> good duke Ri∣charde to be hanged that so muche loued you and doone great honour, it shall be to you great shame, and so I swere to you vpon all halowes that yf I see hange Rycharde of nor∣mandy I shal part out of your hoste fro your seruyce, and I shall goe so ferre that ye shall neuer haue helpe of me. Rowland sayd Olyuer ween not that I shall abide after that yee are gone, for the kinge doothe great wronge to Reinawde our cosin. Ful sore an angred was the kynge to heere these wordes but he helde thā his peace and sayde neuer a worde. And wyt it that al the hoste was mo∣ued bycause they feared sore lest Rei∣nawde should make Richard of nor∣mandy to be hanged, for he was wel beloued of the folke of Charlemain, &amp; also he was of a greate kynred and a noble lygnage.</P>
<P>THis morning thā Reinawde that was within Ardein af∣ter that he had hearde hys masse: he called his three bretherne and sayde to them. My brethern it goeth ful ill with vs that we can haue no peace wyth Charlemaine, but sythe it is thus come: by the fayth that I owe to the olde Aymon our father I shal angre hym right sore, for I am sure yf he had vs in his handes he wolde vtterly destroy vs without pitie, &amp; therfore I am disposed for to doo the worste that I can agaynst hym. For now afore his eyen I shal hange the duke Richarde of Normandy, for I am well sure that Charlemayne shall wexe fyre angry for it, whan he shall see him. Brother sayd Alard, I pray you as muche as I can that ye wyll not doo as ye saye, for I shall hange hym my selfe yf ye will. Bro∣ther sayd Reynawde I wyl wel, now commaunde sayde Alarde that y<SUP>e</SUP> gi∣bet be dressed all hye vpon the gate, that Charlemayne and all his hoste may see him. Shortly to speak: Rei∣nawde dyd doo make y<SUP>e</SUP> gibet in suche a place y<SUP>t</SUP> Charlemayne might see it as well as he had be by. And wyt it that Rowland was the fyrst man y<SUP>t</SUP> perceyued it, and whan he saw this: he began to crye as hye as he myght. Syr, now see how they wyll hange the duke Richarde with great shame alas he hath shrewdly enployed his tyme in your seruice. And now he is full yll rewarded for it, and also it is shrewed ensample to al that serue you. Alas sayd Olyuer now shall y<SUP>e</SUP> good duke Rycharde be hanged with great shame, for I see the Gibet righ¦ted vp. Holde your peace sayde than Charlemayne, they doo all thys but for to make me abasshed, and that they myght haue peace with me, but for all this they shall not haue it, &amp; I promyse you they dare doo hym no harme of his bodye. Thus recō∣forted
<PB N="cxl" REF="145"/> Charlemayne him selfe, wee∣nyng that Reynawde had not durst hange the duke Richarde. This hā∣gyng: Rowlande (that had the thyng at herte) behelde alwayes towarde the towne, and saw that men righ∣ted the ladder to the gybet, than sayd he to Oliuer. Ha Olyuer true felaw and good freende, yonder I see the ladder that is set vp all redye for to hange Rycharde of Normandy, ful yll he hath bestowed hys good ser∣uyce wyth Charlemayne. Syr O∣lyuer sayde Rowlande, ye saye well trouth, god saue Rycharde.</P>
<P>AFter y<SUP>t</SUP> the ladder was rygh∣ted to the gybet aboue vpon the hyghe gate of Ardeyne: Reynawd called ten of his folke, and sayde to them. Galantes go fet me the Duke Rycharde. For I will that he be han∣ged incontinent. Syr sayd they wee shall doo your cōmaundement. And they went into the chambre where y<SUP>e</SUP> noble duke of Normandy was, and founde hym playinge at the Chesse wyth Yonnet y<SUP>e</SUP> sonne of Reynawd, and than these mē tooke hym &amp; said. Syr duke come forth, for Reinawde hath commaunded that ye shall be hanged incontinent, whan the duke Rycharde of Normandy heard these felawes speake thus to hym: he loo∣ked vpon them ouer the shoulder, &amp; wolde not answere to them, but said my fayre Yōnet, hast you for to play for it is tyme that we goe to dinner. And whan these galantes saw that Rycharde of Normandy answered no worde vnto them: they began to take him on euery syde and sayde to hym. Aryse vp duke Rycharde, for in dispite of Charlemayne that loueth you so muche▪ ye shalbe hāged now. Whan the duke Richarde sawe that these sergeauntes had him thus by the arme, and helde in his hāde a la∣dy of Iuery where w<SUP>t</SUP> he wolde haue giuen a mate to yonnet: he withdrew his arme and gaue to one of the ser∣geauntes suche a stroke with it into the forehead that he made him tum∣ble ouer and ouer at his feete, &amp; than he tooke a rooke &amp; smote another w<SUP>t</SUP> all vpon his head that he all to brost it to the brayne, &amp; after that he smote another of thē with his fyst so great a stroke that he brake hys necke, and fell dead vnto the erth.

<P>And whan he had sayd so: he sayd to Yonnet y<SUP>t</SUP> was all abasshed. Playe well my chylde, for ye shalbe mated, I trowe these truantes were dron∣ken that thus wolde haue had me a∣way, but I haue well giuen to them their parte. And whan yonnet heard hym saye so: he durste not speake a∣gaynst it because he sawe hymselfe so sore an angred, but played wyth his rooke that he should not be ma∣ted, but he might not saue the mate. Whan the duke Richarde had mated Yonnet: he called a yeman y<SUP>t</SUP> was there, &amp; sayd to hym. Goe take these carles that lyen heere dead and caste them out at the windowes.

<P>ALarde was y<SUP>e</SUP> same time out of the casteil, &amp; awayted that Rycharde were brought to him that he might goe hange him, and he saw how the dead were cast downe out of the wyndowes of the toure, wherof he was wrothe &amp; went to Reynawde and sayd to hym. Syr I knowe that the duke Richarde will not let hym self so be take, and ryght deere it shal cost or he be brought to the gibet, see how he hath slayne your men, &amp; how he hath cast them out at the Towre, at the windowes. Brother sayd Rei¦nawde, the Duke Richarde is to be doubted in hys takyng, let vs go to the helpe of our folk for els they ben in daunger of theyr lyues. And th{us} as they wolde haue gone: they that he had sente for to take Rycharde, came there vnto hym. And whan they saw Reynawde: they sayd vnto him. By god syr the duke Richarde shal not be take without great strife For he hath slayne three of our fela∣wes. And whan we sawe that: wee fled away, and left hym playīg with your sonne Yonnet.

And whan he had sayd these wordes: he went towarde the towre where Ry∣charde was, and his brethern wente with him, for they wolde not leue hī, and also .xl. men well armed for to take the duke Richard if he wolde de∣fende hymselfe, whan Reynawde was come to the gate of the towre: he made it to be opened &amp; wente in &amp; whan he was in: he sayd to the duke Richarde. Vassayll whye haue you slayne my men? Cosin sayd he, nowe hear me if it please you. It is trouth that .x. ribaudes cam here right now &amp; layde hande vpon me, &amp; they sayde that ye had thus commaūded them, whyche thinge I coulde not beleue. For &amp; ye had sayd so: it should haue be spoken outrageouslye: so made I them to flee out of this chambre in great haste and slew of them I wote not how many bycause I might not absteine me, &amp; if it semeth you that I haue doone amis: so take ye amēdes vpon me. But I will wel that ye wit that I wolde not haue doone to you suche a shame as yee haue doone to me▪ if I had had you as ye haue me, Reynawde if I haue doone amis in any maner: I am redy to make amē∣des for it, but ye know it is no reasō that no Carle shall Iudge suche a man as I am, for that longeth to a king, to a duke, or to an erle, the cus∣tome is suche ye wot it well, if the earles haue harme be it y<SUP>t</SUP> haue med∣led them w<SUP>t</SUP> it, none ought to blame me therfore. By god Richarde sayde then Reynawde ye shal say what ye wil, but trust me yf I haue not this day peace w<SUP>t</SUP> Charlemayne: I shall make you to be hāged in such a place where that Charlemain may se you And whā reinawde had said this: he made Richarde to be take, &amp; made his handes to be bounde fast and after

By my soule Reynawde sayd Richarde, I fere me not, that ye shall doo that ye sayd, for ye dare not doo it as lōg as Charlemayne is a liue. Whan Reynawd hearde al the duke speake thus: he was so wroth that he loked all blacke in the face for angre, and than he sayde to Rycharde, by that god y<SUP>t</SUP> made me, ye shal soone knowe what I dare doo &amp; whether I am a cowarde or hardy, &amp; than he made him to be brought where as the ga∣loes were righted, &amp; than he sayde to him. Richarde I wyll that of two thynges ye chose one yf ye lust, y<SUP>t</SUP> is, that ye make me haue peace w<SUP>t</SUP> char∣lemaine: or els y<SUP>t</SUP> ye helpe me against him, &amp; but if ye doo this: wyt that I shal make you be hāged &amp; strāgled, &amp; I shall not leue you for all this y<SUP>t</SUP> ye be of my lignage, &amp; yf ye wil take my part agaynst the king Charlemain: ye shalbe deliuered forthw<SUP>t</SUP>. By god Reynawde sayd than Richard, nowe haue I heard you speke like a childe, ween ye y<SUP>t</SUP> I shal doo y<SUP>e</SUP> ye say for fere of death? certes nay, for charlemain is my souerayne lorde, and of him I holde mine heritage, and thoughe he dooth wrong to leue me heere: I ou∣ght not to fayle him therfore. But &amp; ye wil doo wel, leue me a messager, y<SUP>e</SUP> whiche I shal sende to Charlemain &amp; to his barōs for to wit if he be dis∣posed for to let me dye heere shame∣fully. By my faith Richard sayd rei∣nawde ye speake now wisely, &amp; thā he called one of his folke &amp; sayde to him.

Of that o∣ther parte ye shall say to Rowland &amp; to all my felawes that yf euer they loued me: y<SUP>t</SUP> they wil shew to Charle∣mayne that it shall be a great shame to him, yf he suffreth that I hye thus shamefullye, syr sayde the messager doubt not. I shall doo your message well. After these thinges thus sayd: the messager went out of the towne to the hoste of Charlemayne, the whi¦che he founde full of thought. And whan he saw him: he made him re∣uerence, &amp; after sayd to hym. Syr wit it that Richarde of Normandye re∣cōmendeth hym humbly to you, and prayeth you as hertlye as he can as to his soueraine lorde y<SUP>t</SUP> if euer ye lo∣ued him: that ye wyll shew it nowe for he mystreth wel of it. For if rey∣nawde haue not peace this day: tour¦ne your sight vpon yonder gate af∣ter that I am come home agayne, &amp; ye shall see him hange shamefully, &amp; whan the messager had sayd this to the kynge: he looked about him, and saw the .xii. peeres, &amp; sayd to theym, fyrst to Rowlād, &amp; after to the other
<PB REF="147"/> Lordes, the duke Rycharde prayeth you Rowland, &amp; all ye in generall, that yf ye euer loued him: y<SUP>t</SUP> ye wyll pray Charlemaine that he wil make peace with Reynawde, or otherwise he is dead without mercy. And whā Rowland heard this: he spake fyrst to the kynge, &amp; sayd. Syr for God I pray you, suffre not that ye be bla∣med, ye know well that how y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Richarde is one of the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st knightes of the worlde, &amp; he hath best serued you at your need. For God syr make peace with Reinawde, for to recouer suche a knight as is y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Rychard of Normandye, for greate shame it were to you for to let him thus die. And whan y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Naymes and the bysshop Turpyn, Ogier, Escouf the sonne of Oedon, and Oliuer of vien heard Rowland speake so: they begā to say to y<SUP>e</SUP> king. By god sit if ye will not make peace with Reynuwde for to recouer our felaw the Duke Ry∣charde: ye shall lose muche by it. For within short time ye shall see your lande destroyed afore you.</P>
<P>WHan Charlemayne saw that his peeres were thus moued for loue of Richarde of Normandy, &amp; that they accorded all for to make peace: he wende to haue gone oute of hys minde, and sware by greate wrathe as a man mad, y<SUP>t</SUP> Reynawde shoulde neuer haue peace with hym but if he had mawgis to doo his wil with hym. And whan he had sayd so he turned him towarde the .xii. pee∣res of Fraunce, &amp; sayd to them. My freende take no fere for Rycharde of Normandy. For Reynawde should sooner let to be drawen one of his e∣yes out: than he should doo him any harme or shame. Syr sayd the Bys∣shop Turpin, ye are beside your self For ye see all redy that Richarde is Iudged to death. Bisshop said char∣lemayne ye speke well folisshli, kno∣we ye not wel that Richard of Nor∣mandye is of y<SUP>e</SUP> linage of Reynawd? I promyse you he dare not doo hym harme by no maner. By god syr said oliuer, ye haue wel paied vs by your sayinge. Why dare not Reynawde hange y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Richarde? for I know so muche by hym that yf he had you as he hath Rycharde: He durst well hange yourself &amp; al vs. Syr Olyuer sayd the messanger. I swere you on my fayth that Reynawd ceassed not all thys day to pray y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Richard that he should forsake Charlemayn and he should saue his lyfe, wherof Rycharde of Normandy wolde doo nothynge, but spake great wordes to Reynawde. And whan that the Messanger had sayd thus: he sayd to the kyng. Syr gyue me leue to goe if it please you, and tel me what I shal say to Richarde of Normandye fro you. Freende sayd Charlemayne ye shal tell him on my behalfe, y<SUP>t</SUP> he put no doubt in nothīg. For Reynawde shall not be so hardy to doo him any harme. Whā the messager that was a wyse knight vnderstoode Charle∣mayne: he coulde not absteyne hym selfe, but he sayd to hym, syr Empe∣rour ye be ouer proude, but I pro∣myse you that Reynawde setteth ly∣tle by your pryde, and I make you sure y<SUP>t</SUP> Alarde wayteth well for my comyng agayne. For he wolde not
<PB N="cxlii" REF="147"/> take a hundred thousand pounde for to leue Rycharde but that he should hang him his owne handes. And as soone as he had sayd so: he went his wayes wythout any leue taking of the kyng streyght to Ardeyne.</P>
<P>ANd whan the .xii. peeres saw the messanger go with an yll answer: they were full sory for it. Ha god sayd Ogyer how the deuyll the kynge is felle and hard of hert, that wil nother peace nor concorde. I am well sure that his pride shalbe cause of a shamefull death to Richarde. O¦gier sayd Rowlande, ye saye trouth but &amp; I see him hang: god neuer help me at my need if I abyde after it w<SUP>t</SUP> Charlemayne whyles I liue, &amp; whā he had sayd so: he went to the other peeres &amp; sayd to them. Lordes what shall we doo? shall we let thus Ry∣charde be hanged our felawe one of the best knightes of the worlde and moste hardy? for thoroughe his pro∣wes he is there as he is, neuer no foule worde issued out of his mouth alas we shall now see hym hange w<SUP>t</SUP> great shame, certes yf wee suffre it: we ben shamed for euer.</P>
<P>ROwland as a man disperate came than to y<SUP>e</SUP> kyng al wroth and sayd to hym in this maner, Syr by my soule I go now oute of your seruise without your leue, &amp; after he sayd to Ogier. Ogyer what wyl ye doo, wil ye come with me, &amp; leue this Deuyll heere, for he is all beside him selfe? By my head Rowland sayde Ogyer ye say trouth. I shall neuer in my lyfe abyde with hym, but I shall go gladlye wyth you where ye wyl. And I shal not leue you for no man in the worlde, syth that he suf∣freth that suche a valiaunt mā shall dye, as the duke Rycharde of Nor∣mandy, that he loued so muche. He should soone doo so bi vs, for he is a man that hath in hym nother loue nor pitie. And whan Oliuer of vyen vnderstoode these wordes: he stoode vp, and sayd. Lordes I will go with you. I haue dwelled heere to longe, and I also sayd the duke Naymes. &amp; in likewise Escoufe the sonne of Oe∣don. And whan the bisshop Turpin saw this: he casted a great syghe, and sayd. By my fayth Charlemayne, it is euill to serue you for of good ser∣uyce ye doo yeelde an euill rewarde, as it is well seen now by the Duke Rycharde of Normandye that hath serued you so well and so truly. And if I dwel any lōger with you I pray god punisshe me for it.</P>
<P>THan whā Charlemayn saw his peeres that were so sore moued with angre agaynst him: he sayd to them. Lordes haue no doubt of nothyng, for the duke Rycharde shall haue no harme. Syr sayde the Duke Naymes ye doo great wrong for to say so, for a foole neuer bele∣ueth till he feele sore, weene you to make vs fooles w<SUP>t</SUP> your wordes? We se y<SUP>e</SUP> galous made vp for to hāg our felaw, wherfore I tel you y<SUP>t</SUP> a mys∣chiefe take me if I dwel with you a∣ny lenger. Whan the duke Naymes had sayd so: he went out of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>∣lion of Charlemayne and in likewise all the Peeres of Fraunce with hym
<PB REF="148"/> and wente into hys tente the whiche he made to be pulled downe inconti∣nent. And whan they of the hoste of Charlemayne saw y<SUP>t</SUP>: they were sore afrayed. And ye ought to wyt that they were so sore moued within a li∣tle while y<SUP>t</SUP> there abode in the hoste of Charlemayne not one baron nor knyght but onlye the poore symple gentilmen, and comin people. whan Rowlande saw thys: he went on his wayes wyth the other peeres. And wit it at that houre y<SUP>e</SUP> hoste of Char∣lemayne was made lesse than it was afore by .xl. thousande men.</P>
<P>REynawde that was vpon the hyghe gate of Ardeyne saw so great numbre of folke cominge togi∣ther: so called he to hym the messa∣ger that was but comen fro Charle¦mayne, and sayd to hym in thys ma∣ner. Come heere messanger, tell me what Charlemayne hath sayd vn∣to you. Syr sayd the messager, wit it that ye haue missed of peace, for char¦lemayne wil nothyng of it, but he sē∣deth you worde by me that ye be not so hardy vpon the eyen of your head to doo any harme to the Duke Ry∣charde of Normandy. And whan he had said this: he turned him toward the duke Rycharde, and sayd to him. Syr duke now may ye know howe muche Charlemayne loueth you.</P>
<P>Wit it for certaine that ye get nother helpe nor succours of him, and for y<SUP>e</SUP> loue of you Rowlande, and all the other peeres of Fraunce ben ful sore an angred with him, For ye may per¦ceyue it well by theyr tentes that bē pulled downe. And so I am sure that the moste parte of the hoste shall de∣part for the loue of you. And so shal not abyde there but only the erle gua¦nellon &amp; his lignage. For theyr ten∣tes ben righted &amp; all the other brou∣ght downe. Whan Reynawde wyste that the frenchemen were angry w<SUP>t</SUP> Charlemayne for the loue of y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Rycharde of Normandy: he chaun∣ged his courage and could not keep him from weepynge. And after he turned hym towarde Rycharde of Normandy and sayd to hym, for god my cosyn I praye you for to pardon me the great shame that I haue doon to you. Reynawde sayd Rycharde I blame you not, for I wot wel that ye cannot doo therto. For the greate pride and cruelnes of Charlemayne is causer of al this. Whā Reynawde had cried mercy to the duke Richard he vnbounde him, and Alarde and Guycharde came to helpe hym for they were all glad that Rychard was deliuered. Notwithstandynge afore that they were disposed for to make him dye shamefully. And whan they had doone so: Reynawde sayd, cosin Rycharde lene vpon this walle, and we shall looke what Charlemayne wyl doo. Syr sayd y<SUP>e</SUP> duke Rycharde ye say well let vs see it.</P>
<P>ANd whan Charlemayn saw that his barons went away as it is said: he was sori for it that he wexed almoste madde all quicke for the greate angre that he had, and helde a demylaunce in hys handes, the whiche he began to gnawe with his teeth so angry he was, and whā his wrathe was a litle gone: he cal∣led

Now lyght on horsbacke lyghtly, and ride after Rowland and after the other barons and tell them in my behalfe that they come speake with me, and I shalbe demened as they wyl them∣selfe, and that I shall pardon Rey∣nawde yf they wyll come agayne to me. Syr sayde the knyght blessed be God that hath brought you to thys mynde. And than this knight tooke an horse and rode hastelye after the xii. peeres of Fraunce. And whan Reynawde that was with the duke Rycharde of Normandye vpon the gate of Ardeyn apperceyued this: he sayde to the duke Richarde of Nor∣mandy, cosin I se rome a knight out of the pauilion of the kynge Charle∣mayne. I beleue that he goeth vnto the twelue Peeres of Fraunce for to make theym to returne agayne. I weene we shall haue this daye peace and god before. Syr sayd Rycharde ye shall haue peace mawgre them al y<SUP>t</SUP> letteth it. I ought for to loue deerli my felowes, the whiche be cause to keepe me from death, &amp; also to haue peace. Wyt it that the knight rode so fast that he ouer tooke Rowlande, &amp; all the other peeres of Fraunce, and said vnto them in this maner of wise Lordes, the kinge Charlemayne sen∣deth you worde by me that ye wyll returne agayne to hym, and he shall pardon Reinawd for the loue of you &amp; for goddes loue come lyghtly. For he neuer left weepyng sythe that yee went your waye from him. Nay∣mes sayd Rowland, let vs retourne agayne. For I holde the peace made wherof this sorowfull warre shall fayle y<SUP>t</SUP> hath lasted so longe a whyle. Whan the Duke Naymes hearde Rowland speake so: he was ryght glad of it, and Ioyned hys handes towarde heauen, and sayde in this maner wise. Good lorde Iesus bles∣sed be the tyme that it hath pleased y<SUP>e</SUP> to tourne the courage of the kynge Charlemayne, and that this vnhap∣py warre is brought to an ende. And whan the Duke Naymes had sayde this: they returned agayne towarde Charlemayne.</P>
<P>ANd whan Reynawde apper¦ceiued that the twelue yeeres wente agayne to Charlemayne: he sayd to the Duke Rycharde of Nor∣mandy. Cosyn the Barons returne agayne. I beleue that the peace shal be made, and that we shal mow wel goe soone at our libertie, now shall Reynawde maye say that I and my brethern ben at his cōmaundemēt, and shall be as longe as we ben men on lyue. Well glad were the Barons of the one part, &amp; of thother, bicause that God had suffred that the peace should be made. And whan Charle∣mayne saw his barons come agayn: he went agaynst thē &amp; sayd. By God my lordes ye are wel ful of great pri∣de y<SUP>t</SUP> ye make me to be come peasible with Reynawde agaynst my wyll, ye know y<SUP>t</SUP> I haue hated hī so muche that I may not see him, but I shalbe angry bycause of his pride that is so great.

<P>IN thys party sheweth the hy∣story that whā Reynawde had put himselfe to the way as yee haue hearde: Richarde of Normandy and his brethern came agayne to Ardein full sory for Reynawde, where as they found the good duchesse Clare, y<SUP>t</SUP> made greate sorowe for her lordes departyng. And whan they were co∣me agayne there: the duke Richarde tooke the duchesse by the hande, and began to recomforte her, &amp; so many fayre wordes he layde vnto her that she slaked a litle her sorow, and after thys the duke Richarde sayde to the brethern of Reynawde, in this ma∣ner. Lordes goe make you redy, and we shall go vnto Charlemayn. Sir sayd the three brethern, let vs whan it please you. And then they went &amp; tooke on the best clothing that they had. And I promise you they were three fayre knightes, and after they were wel apparayled, they mounted eche of them vpon a palfraye of hye pryce ryght fayre wythout anye ar∣mes. And for to speake shortly: they yssued out of Ardeyn and came to y<SUP>e</SUP> pauilion of Charlemayne. And whā the king saw thē, he was ryght glad So he commaunded al hys barons that they should go againe them. Ha god sayd Rowland, now comen the three bretherne well sorye, certayne they haue a cause, for they haue lost theyr helpe succoure and hope. Now I see that the duke Richard cometh with them, wherof he dooth well, for he is their kynsman.</P>
<P>NOw ye ought to wit that y<SUP>e</SUP> three brethern of Reynawde came to the pauilion of Charlemain well honestly arayed. And whā they were afore the kyng: they kneeled hū∣bly at his feete, and Alarde spake fyrst &amp; sayd. Sir Reynawde our bro¦ther recōmendeth him hūbly to your good grace, &amp; salueth you as his so∣uerayne lorde, &amp; he sendeth you Ry∣charde the duke of Normandy, whi∣che ye se heere, and so he praieth you y<SUP>t</SUP> ye will haue vs for recommended, for he hath taken his way towarde y<SUP>e</SUP> holy lande for to accomplisshe your commaūdemēt. Freende sayd Char∣lemayne ye be right welcome. Syth that it please our lorde that we shal be freendes. I shall doo for you, and shal bring you al to honour, as it ap¦perteyneth to suche knightes as ye ben. And yf god wyl bring Reynawd saufe agayne from his viage: I shal holde him as deere as I doo mine owne neuew Rowland, for he is re∣plenysshed w<SUP>t</SUP> great worthines. Syr sayd Richard god bring him agayn, whan the king had thus spoken w<SUP>t</SUP> the brethern of Reynawde: he came to the duke Rycharde of Normandy &amp; kissed him more than .x. times, and whan he had feasted him ynough: he said to him, duke Richarde I praye you y<SUP>t</SUP> ye wil tel me what prisō gaue you Reynawde &amp; what meates for to eat. Sir said the duke of Normādy by the fayth that I owe to god and to you I had better prison, and was more at mine ease than euer knyght was, for I was serued of the same y<SUP>e</SUP> Reynawde was, and sometyme et∣ter, and so I promyse you syr that the gentyll duchesse hys wyfe made me great cheere, and good company
<PB REF="151"/> wyth her two fayre chyldren. Syr I beseche you if that euer ye loued me: that ye wyll worshyp Alarde &amp; hys bretherne yf it please you, for they haue doone to me great honour, and they haue giuē me great giftes. And yf it please you ye shal haue the good duchesse and her chyldren for recom∣mended, for she is the humblest lady of the worlde, and the moste wysest. Rycharde sayd Charlemayne, wyt it that I shal not fayle them as long as lyfe shalbe in my body. And whā the children of Reynawde shal be in age for to be made knightes: I shal doube them to it mine owne handes with great worship, and god spare me lyfe, and so shall I gyue them lā∣des ynoughe for to maynten theyr astate.

<P>WHan they had deuysed all y∣noughe of the thynges afore sayd: the kynge Charlemayne com∣maunded that he should be dyslod∣ged, and anon his commaundemēt was doone, and than euery man put hymselfe towarde the way towarde his countrie. And whan that y<SUP>e</SUP> king saw that it was time: he moūted on horsebacke, and tooke on his way to¦warde the citie of lege.

<P>And whan the mornyng was come, he made be brought afore hym the good horse of Reynawde Bayarde. And whan he saw him: he began for to laye in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his wyse. Ha Bayarde, bayarde, thou hast often angred me, but I am come to y<SUP>e</SUP> poynt, god gra∣mercy for to auenge me, and I pro∣myse thee thou shalt now abye it ful deere the tourment and felony that I haue often times had by thee. And whan the kyng had sayd so: he made a great milstone to be fastened at the necke of bayard, and than made him to be cast from the brydge downe in∣to the water, &amp; whan Bayarde was thus tombled in the ryuer: he sanke vnto the botome of it. And whan the kynge saw that: he made great Ioye and so sayd. Ha bayarde nowe haue I that I desyred and wysshed so lōg For ye be now dead, but if ye drinke out al the water. And whan the frē∣che men sawe the greate cruelnes of Charlemayne that auenged himself vpon a poore beast: they were yll cō∣tent. And than spake the bisshop tur¦pyn, and sayd Ogyer of Denmarke, what thinke you by Charlemayne? he hath well shewed at this a great parte of his great felony, syr sayd O∣gier ye say trouth, he hath doone to great folye for to make dye suche a good beast as this horse was. Syr sayd Oliuer to Rowlande. Charle∣mayne is now waxen all folyshe, ye saye full trouth sayd Rowlande. I perceyue it full well and for to say y<SUP>e</SUP> trouth: there was none of the .xii. pee¦res but he wept for loue of the good horse Bayarde. But who someuer was sorye for it. Charlemayne was glad of it.</P>
<P>NOw ye ought to know that after that bayarde was caste in the riuer of meuze: he wente vnto the botom as ye haue herde, &amp; might not come vp for bicause of the great
<PB N="clxvi" REF="151"/> stone that was at his necke whiche was horryble heuye, and whan bay∣arde sawe he myghte none otherwise scape: he smote so longe and so harde with his feete vpon the mylle stone: that he brast it, and came agayne a∣boue the water and began to swym; so that he passed it all ouer at the o∣ther syde, and whan he was come to londe: he shaked hymselfe for to ma∣ke falle the water fro him and began to crie hie, and made a merueyllous noyse, and after beganne to renne so swyftlye as the tempest had borne him awaie, and entred in to the great forest of Ardeyn. And whan the king Charlemayne saw that bayard w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s escaped: he tooke so great sorowe for it that almost he loste his wyt for an∣gre. But all the barons were gladde of it. Thus as ye haue heard: escaped bayarde out of the handes of Char∣lemayne, and wit it for very certayn that the folke of the countrey saien, that he is yet a lyue within the wood of Ardeyn. But wyt it whan he see∣eth man or woman: he renneth anon awaye, so that no bodye maye come neere hym. And after all these thyn∣ges: the kynge Charlemaine as an∣grye as he was departed fro Meuse and went in to a chapell that was nigh, and called to him al his barons and gaue them leue to goe into theyr countreys, wherof they were ryght glad, for they wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sore desyringe for to see theyr wyues their children and their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ndes.</P>

<P>NOwe telleth the history that af∣ter that Reynawde was depar∣ted from Ardeyn for to goe in to the holy lond: he went so much by the iourneys that he came to constantino∣ple, and lodged him in an holi womās house, whiche serued him as well as she coulde, and gaue him suche meat as go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had gyuen to her, and after she wash<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d his feet as she was wunt to doo to other Pylgrymes. And whā this good woman had doon so much: she tooke Reynawde by the hande, and broughte him in to her owne chambre, and sayde to him, Good mā ye shall lie heere, for in my other chambre ye may not be, for there is a poore pylgryme that is sore sycke.

And than she tooke Reynawde by the hande, and brought him to the pylgryme that was in his bed. And whan Reynawd saw him: he knewe well that it was his cosyn Mawgis wherof he was ryghte glad, so began he to speake to him and sayd. Freend how is it with your persōe. And whā Mawgis heard Reynawd speake to hym: he lept oute of his bed as he ne∣uer had be sycks and enbrased Rey∣nawde more than twentye tymes and after said to him.

And then he rehersed hym al the maner as ye haue hearde aboue, and all the treatye that he had had wyth Charlemayne.</P>
<P>WHan Mawgis vnderstoode the wordes of Reinawde: he was ryght glad of it. And than he embraced againe Reynawde and said to hym I am now whole for the good tydinges that ye haue brought to me. And therfore I am dysposed to goe with you, and doubt not we shall not dye for hungre, for I am mayster for to begge breade. And whan the good woman sawe that these two pylgry∣mes made so greate feaste the one to the other: she thought it myght none otherwise be but they were of great lygnage, and that they had had some greate a doo togyther, and she sayde to theym. Fayre lordes I see that ye kowe well eche other, wherfore I praye you tel me what ye be, and from whence ye come? Good woman saide Mawgis syth that ye wyll knowe of our beyng: I shall tell you a parte of it. Wit it than that we been two poore gentylmen that are banyshed oute of fraunce.

And whan the lady that good womā vnderstood these wordes: she had greate Ioye.</P>

And whan the day was come: Reinawde and Mawgis arose and tooke leaue of the holy lady, and put theimselfe to the waie. And wyt that so muche went the two pylgry∣mes by their iourneies that they cam nighe the citie of Hierusalem, and were but a litell myle from it, so that they mighte see well the temple and the towre of Dauid, and the most par∣te of Ierusalem. And whein mawgis and Reinawde sawe that: they were ryght gladde of it, and yeelded graces vnto god that he had suffred them to come so nyghe the holye citie. Whan they had doone thus theyr prayers: they went on their waye for to haue gonne within Ierusalem. But they were gon but a lytil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: whan they sawe a greate hoste aboute the citie euyn a fore the torwe of Dauid where were many yauillions of the christen that were there for to fighte with the ad∣miral of Percie that by force helde the citie of Iherusalem, Reinawd did tarie whan he saw the hoste that was afore the cytie: and saide to his cosin Mawgis. Cosin what folke is yonder as ye thinke, for it semeth a greate hoste afore Iherusalem, are they Sarasyns or christen, what say you? Surelye saide Mawgys I can not tell, and I am sore meruayled what it may be. Thus as Reinawde and Mawgys spake togither: there came an olde man rydyng that waye that came from the hoste. And whan Reynawde sawe hym: he went hym ayenste and sayde to him. God saue you good mā, tell me and it plea∣se you, what be they afore the holy ci∣tie, are they christen or Sarasins? Pil¦gryme said the olde mā they ben chri∣sten that haue besieged Iherusalem, and canne not take it, but ye maye well goe without perill. Now tel me said Reinawde who is within Ihe∣rusalem? wyt it saide the olde man, that the admyral of Percie hathe ta∣ken it by treason. And how hathe he taken it by treason sayde Reinawd? wyt sayde the olde man that the ad∣myrall arrayed hym as a Pylgryme and manye of his folke with him, &amp; went into the citie one after another and whan they were all within: they blewe an horne ryght hyghe, and set hande to their swerdes, and fought strongly, so that they were maysters of the citie or euer the king Thomas could be armed nor his folke, y<SUP>e</SUP> which coulde not saue them selfe with such fewe folke as was lefte hym alyue, but he was taken prisoner, and a∣non all the countrey rose vp, and ha∣ue besyeged the citie as ye see, and I truste with the grace of God: that the citie shall be take shortly. Nowe tell me said Reynawd if they of the citie come out often vpon the chrysten. yea saide the olde man, for they ben much folke within, and the thing that most greueth vs: is that oure folke ha∣ue no heade nor no Lord. And ye wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> well that folke that haue no heade nor no Lorde: canne doo but lytyll good.

<PB REF="153"/> he tooke on his waye with his cosyn Mawgys, and ceased not tyll they were comine within the hoste. And whan they were come there: euery mā looked vpon Reynawd that was so fayre a pilgryme and so calle a man. And Reinawd looked here and there, and wist not where to put himselfe, than he aduised him and sayde to Mawgis. My cosin we must see that we haue a litelle reede or some other thing, for to make vs a lodges there at one corner of the walle, and whan Reinawd had sayd so: Mawgis cea∣sed not till he had made a litill lod∣ge. This hanginge that they made their lodge, the admyrall of Percie yssued oute of Iherusalem with wel three thousande fyghtinge men, and entred into the christen hoste toward saynt steuyns churche.</P>
<P>ANd whan the good erle of Ra∣ines, and wallerauen of fayete and Geffray of Nasareth sawa that: they came anone to theyr harneys. And I tell you that there Iaffas of Rames was soone armed sooner thā the other and incontynente he ranne vpon the turkes and beganne to crye Iaffa as hie as he could, and smote vpon the Persians, and dommaged them sore, for he was a valiaunt mā in armes. And whan all they of the hoste were armed: than began there a bataylle of the one parte, and of the other right cruell. Than came there geffraye of Nasareth, which entred amonge the thickest of the Sarasins and began fast to smyte theym deade to the erthe. Shortly to speake: thys battayll was ryght great and mortal for there were many speres broken, and many sheeldes clouen, and of the one parte and also of the other were manye menne ouerthrowen to the grounde. And ye oughte to wyt that wallerauen of fay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e smot the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e dead manye a painym, so that it was won∣der to see his faires of armes for no persayn durst abyde afore him.

And anon he tooke a spere in his hand, and went ayenst Geffray. And whan Geffraye sawe that: he ranne asprely vpon him and they gaue eche other suche strokes in theyr sheeldes that bothe theyr spe∣res flewe in many peces, and with this cours was the admyralle ouer∣throwen from his horse to the erthe, but Geffray of Nasareth abode in y<SUP>e</SUP> arsons of his sadle. And whan the admyrall sawe him on the ground: he was angry for it, so rose he vp lygh∣telye and set hand to his swerde and made greate semblaunt for to defend hym selfe. And whan Geffraye of Nasareth sawe this: he turned hym toward the admyrall and smot hym so great a stroke with his swerde vp¦on his helme that he astonyed hym. And whan Geffray saw that he made no defence: he bowed hys bodye to∣ward him, and tooke the admyrall by the helme and wolde haue brought hym away. And whan the admyrall saw that he was take: he cried Percy as loude as he mighte, so that his folke hearde hym and ranne there as he was, and delyuered hym from
<PB N="clviii" REF="153"/> the handes of Geffraye and set hym vpon a horse and broughte him with them, whan than Reinawd saw that the batayll was so cruell: he sayde to Mawgis. Alas cosyn yf I had my harneys I should goe gladly succour our folke, for it is that thinge that I haue moste desyred as that I myghte beare armes ayenst the sarasins, thā said Mawgis to him, ye are not wise to saye so, ye woe howe we been tra∣ueylled of our pylgrymage, and that it is time that we rest vs a lytill and also the warre shall not be ended so soone, but that ye maye proue youre∣selfe in armes afore the holye cytie of Iherusalem be wonne, wherfore I pray you rest your selfe thys nyght, and to morow and god before we shal be fyghte our enmyes, for I haue de∣lybered that I shall be no hermyt as longe as we ben togither, but I shal helpe you with al my power, but one thinge I tell you that neuer whyle I lyue I shall cast no charme more, for I haue promysed it God and all the saynctes to whome I praye to keep me therfro, but I tell you that I loue you so hertelye that yf I shoulde be dampned, yet shoulde I come oute of my hermytage for to succoure you yf ye had need. My cosyn sayd Reinaw∣de I thanke you for youre good wyl and I knowe well ye saye trouth that we haue mystre of rest, but I canne not keepe my selfe, but I must goe to battayll. Alas that I haue not Bay∣arde and slamberge my good swerde, for I shoulde doo thys daye that god shoulde conne me thanke of it.</P>
<P>Ryghte sory was Reynawd that he hadde nother horse nor harneys for to helpe the chrysten folke.</P>
<P>THis hanging that Reynawd and Mawgis spake togither: the erie of Rames, Geffraye of Na∣sareth and wallerauen made greate slaughter of the turkes and of y<SUP>e</SUP> per∣cians. And whan the admyrall sawe this: he with drew his folke again in to the cytye of Iherusalem. For he might no lenger suffre the great har∣me and hurte that the christen made hym. And whan the crysten saw that the Sarasins were discom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed they chased theim sharpelye, and stewe so many of theym that none canne tell the numbre. And than the erle I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffas that was a worthy knight and a wi∣se, he went to the gate of saynt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teuē, and kepte him there with his folke. And whan the Turkes came for to saue theimself within Iherusalem: the erle Iaffas went ayenst them and kepte the passage that they myghte not entre at theyr ease wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hin the ci∣tye, and there agayne were manye of them slayne. And the admyrall sawe that he was an angred for it, and tooke an other waye to the cytie to∣warde the gate fore, and it happed than that the turkes passed afore the lodge of Reynawde and by the great prece and stampynge of their horses the lodge of Reynawd was broken and marred, wherof Reynawde was angrye. Than Reynawde looked a∣boute hym, and founde nothynge for to fyghte wythall but a forke that susteyned vp theyr lodge, that was great &amp; stronge. And he tooke it anon wyth both hys handes and mounted vpon a wall that was by the way<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB REF="154"/> And as the turkes passed there by: he layed vpon them with a greate staffe and smote them downe, two and two at once as swynes, and to saye the trouthe: Reinawde beinge thus vpon the broken wall slewe mo than a hun∣dred of them as they passed by him. And whan Mawgys sawe that Rei∣nawd dyd so well, he rooke his palstet and came vpon the wall by him, and began to smite with both his handes so great strokes, that thei that he tau∣ght fell deade to the grounde. Whyle that Reinawd and Mawgis dyd the∣se faytes of armes: came there the erle of Rames and Geffray of Nasareth that folowed after the Sarasins with all dylygence. Whiche sawe the great quantite of deade Sarasyns, that Reynawde and Mawgys had slayne vpon the waye by theyr prowes in so muche that all moste menne could ri∣de no more that way, for y<SUP>e</SUP> great heape of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urkes that laye dead there, wherof the Sarasyns were sore abasshed.</P>
<P>Than the erle of Rames shewed to Geffray of Nasareth the great slau∣ghter that the two pylgrymes hadde doon and merueylled of him that held the forke that he was so greate and so valliaunt a man, and in lykewise that other that helde the palster that was not so great.

Ha goddis sayd Geffray I meruayill what folke they are, I be¦leue that god hathe sente theym to vs for our sauyng, or elles they ben ouer hardye fooles seyng that they ben al naked, and fere not the deth. Sir said the earle of Rames, what so euer they ben: they doo like worthye men. God al mighty keep them from hurt, daunger and from euel combraunce. For they haue well greued our enmi∣es and I shall neuer be at myne ease tyll that I haue spoken wyth theym, for to wyt what folke they be and fro whence they come.</P>
<P>GReat was the chase that the erle of rames, Geffray of Nasareth and wallerauen made after the Turkes and persiās. For right great slaughter they made of theym or they were withdrawen within Iherusa∣lem. For they lefte not the chase tyll they were within the gate fore. Whan Reynawde sawe that all the Sarasins were passed he caste after them his great staffe for he could doo no more to thē. And after he be thou∣ghte hym and descended fro the wal, and sayde he wolde not lese hys for∣ke and fet it agayne, for it shoulde serue for to make hys lodge as it dyd before. This hangyng: the earle of Rames cam from the chasyng again, and soughte the two Pylgrymes for to speake with them, and he foūd theim where they were makinge of their lodge. Than he behelde them well and sayde nothinge. And whan he sawe that they were so greate and so well shapen pryncypally Reynaw¦de, for he wanted nothing, he lighted from his horse and tooke theim by the hande, and made theim to sytte besyde hym. Whan they were set: the erle sayd to Reynawde. My freende, I praie you telle me trouthe of that I shall afke you. By the faithe that
<PB N="cxlix" REF="154"/> ye owe to the temple where ye purpo∣se to goe. Tell me youre names and what ye be, and of whence ye come, and why you goe so poorlye arayed. Sir said Reynawd sith that it plea∣se you to wit of oure beynge, and of our name: I shall telle it you with a good wyll. Nowe wyt it that I am called Reynawd of Mountawban, but Charlemayne hathe casted me therfrom wrongefully, the Duke Ai∣mon is my father, and I am now co∣me in to the holy londe for to serue our lord ayenst his enmies. For thus hathe commaunded me to doo Char∣lemayne my souerayne lorde, whan I made peace with him. And that wor∣se is: I must needes come thus poore∣ly arrayed as ye see beggyng my bre∣de where so euer I goe or come, whe∣re ayenst I wolde neuer goe for to ha∣ue peace. Whan the erle of rames vn∣derstoode Reynawd: he was gladde of him, and heaued vp his handes to¦warde heauen and thanked God and after sayd. O noble knight Reinaw∣de of Mountawban the best knyghte of the worlde, take heere my homage. For I gyue my selfe vnto you and al my goodes. And whan Reynawde sawe this: he sayde to the earle of Ra∣mes. Stand vp for ye profer me out∣rage. By god sayd the erle I shall ne∣uer aryse tyll ye haue graunted me a thynge. Sir sayde Reynawde, I graunt it you with a good wyll, and with good herte. Gramercye sayd the erle, and than he stoode vp and sayde to Reynawde. Is it trouthe that ye haue peace with the great king Char∣lemaine? Alas where been youre bretheren the worthy knightes and Mawgys youre cosyn, in whome ye haue so great trust, &amp; your good horse bayard: Sir said Reynawd wit that I had peace with the kinge Charle∣maine of the warre that so longe hath lasted by suche maner as I shall tell you, that it is that I must come heere in suche clothyng as ye see vpon me, and heere is Mawgis my cosyn that is comen heere with his free wyll, for he is not constrayned therto, for the kynge Charlemayn weneth he be deade longe a goe and my bretherne been abyden with my wyfe and my chyldren. For the kyng hath returned all oure lyuelode vnto theym again. And whan the earle vnderstoode the trouthe of all, he was ryghte gladde of it, so that he beganne to crye with a hyghe voyce. Ha duke Reynawde of Mountawban, howe greately be you welcome heere to vs, as the most valyaunte knight of the world blis∣sed be the good lorde that hathe con∣duyte you hyther. And I praye you for god: that ye receyue myne homage so shall ye saue the worshyppe of the kynge thomas that is nowe pryso∣ner there within the citie, for and ye be oure capitayne and oure heade: I put no doubt but we shall well soone take Iherusalem. And thus shall the kynge Thomas be belyuered oute of the handes of the false sarasyns.</P>
<P>THere came all the barons of Surrye that were full glad of the coming of Reynawd of moun∣tawban, to whome they made greate reuerence, and feasted hym ryghte
<PB REF="155"/> hyghly. And shortly to speake: they al prayed him to be theyr lorde and head capitayne, and that he wolde guyde them as the erle of Rames had doon afore. And whan Reynawde sawe that all the barons of Surrye desy∣red and prayed him so sore for to re∣ceyue theyr homages: he sayde vnto theym. Lordes sith that it pleaseth you for to doo me this great honour: I take it, saufe alwaye the ryght of kynge Thomas whiche is your so∣uerayne lorde. Syr sayde the barons we will haue it thus. And thenne he receyued their homagis, and whan he hadde receyued theim: the erle of Rames kneeled before him and sayd Syr I wil that ye giue me now that thinge that ye haue graunted me. Sir sayde Reynawde saye what it is and ye shall haue it.

And if ye wyl gyue any thing: I shall delyuer it to you, and I shal gyue you syxe of my knightes for to serue you, Good earle of Rames gramercye of the worship that ye doo to me▪ than the erle tooke Reynawd by the hande and broughte so hym in to his pauyllion, and made him to be serued as his souerayne lorde, and whan all the barons hadde conueyed Reynawde to the pauyllion of the er∣le of Rames: they tooke leaue of him and went again in to their pauylliōs and thanked God that he hadde sent theym suche a knyghte and so vally∣aunte a manne to be their capitaine, and theyr Lorde. And than whan the erle of Rames sawe that all the barons were gon to theyr pauilliōs: he made to be broughte there manye good horses and fayre paifrays, and ryche raymentes of dyuers coloures furred with ryche furres and all ma∣ner of good harneys for the warre, curaces and ryche helmes, and noble swerdes, and greate plentye of plate bothe of fyne golde and of syluer and all thys he presented to Reynawde. But he wolde take nothynge but on∣lie a complete harneys for his body, and a swerde that he chose there a∣monge all, and an horse. And all the remenaunt: he made to be dealed to the poore knyghtes that had mystre and need of it. And whan the erle of Rames sawe that Reynawde hadde taken but one horse, one harneys and one swerde: he sayde vnto him. Syr for God take on you a nother raymente, for ye wot well it apper∣teyneth not to suche a man as ye be for to goe clothed as ye doo. Sir said Reynawd pardonne me and it plea∣se you, for I shall neuer were none o∣ther raymente but this that I haue nowe on, tyll that I haue kyssed the holy sepulcre wherin God was put after that he was brought downe fro the crosse. Sir said then the erle, doo as ye wil, and than he went to Maw∣gys and said to him. I praye you put awaye this capye and this hood and take other raimentes, syr said Maw∣gis than I pray you be not dysplea∣sed, yf I full fyll not youre desyre at this time, for I tell you that I haue promysed that I sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll were no other cloth as longe as I lyue but such as the same is. Thenne whanne the erle sawe that Reynawde nor Mawgys
<PB N="cl" REF="155"/> wolde not take none other raymen∣tes for no thinge that he coulde saye vnto them: he was sory for it. And than he made the tables redye for to goe to supper. And whan they hadde supped the erle of rames called wal∣lerauen of fayer and Geffray of Na∣zareth and sayde to them. Now thin∣ke for to doo well syth that god hath sent to vs suche succour. And whan the barōs heard the erle speake thus: they answered we shal doo oure best by the grace of God. And than euery man went to his pauillion, and made greate plentie of torches to be fyred so that it was merueylles of the light that was in the hoste, and euery man began to daunce and disporte theym∣selfe aboute their tentes and pauyl∣lions a longe while for Ioye of the comynge of Reinawde. And whan turkes that kept the towre of Dauyd sawe the greate lyghte that was in the hoste of the christen: they were all merueylled of it. Than some of them went and shewed it to theyr maister and lorde. And whan the admyralle hearde the tydynges: he began to crye hie and said. O Machomet what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il∣leth now that vnhappi folke that ma¦ke so greate feast. I beleue that they ben as the swanne is whan she shall die, for I am sure they shal one of the∣se daies be al slaine, and therfore they make so great ioye. And whan bar∣bas the admirall had sayde this, he sware by machomet afore all his ba∣rons that he should make an issue on the morow for to hewe al the christen in peeces. Syr saide an olde paynym Beware your fleshe well of a greate kerle thae is there new come among them, the whiche bereth a great forke in his hande, for yf he hyt you: ye are but dead.

I know him not sayd thadmyral to the paynym, but and: I canne hye hym with my branke of steele I shall make him leue his great head behind him for a pledge till he commeth a∣gain, for he is naked, and therfore he may not endure ayenst me.</P>
<P>WHan the kynge Thomas that was there prisoner saw the great feast &amp; ioye that the christen made: Wist not what he should thinke, but sait to himself. Ha goddes what haue now my folk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that they make suche a noyse &amp; suche a sporte, alas doo they not remem∣bre me? I beleue better ye than naye, for the feaste that they make nowe is for somwhat. Wyt it that they of ra∣mes, and of Iaffes and of all the countrey aboute Iherusalem whan they saw the great light: they wende that the citie had be set a fyre, and so∣me were sore aferde leste thoste had a doo. Thus was all the countrey a∣basshed, but they that were in thoste cared but litell for it. And whan they had sported themselfe ynoughe: they ordeined the watche and after went to rest. And whan the day was come: the barons rose and went to the pauil¦lyon of Reinawde, whiche was vp and redie, and they salued him reue∣rently, and after said vnto him thus, sir what thinke ye that we must doo? shal we assaille the citie or no? Lordes saide the duke Reinawde, me semeth
<PB REF="156"/> that it were good for to giue to it a sawte. For we haue great auauntage afore hande, for he that shall dyein the sawtinge of the holye citie: he shal be saued without doubte. whiles that the barons deuised thus together for to giue a sawte to the citie: the admy∣rall of Percie made to open the gate a force, and yssued out of the town w<SUP>t</SUP> ten thousande fightinge menne well armed. And whan Reinawde and the barons of surry knewe it: they ranne to their harneys. Reinawd was ar∣med incontinent, &amp; tooke his helme and his swerde, and lighted vpō his horse that the erle of Rames had ge∣uen him. And whan reinawde was on horsebacke: Mawgis armed him also, and mounted on horsebacke, and began to crie. Barons of Surrye, be not dysmayed in no wyse, for I pro∣myse god I shal neuer returne to be hermyt: yf the turkes be not dyscom∣fyted and ouerthrowen. And after he had sayde so: he went to Geffraye of Nasareth and saide to hym. Ba∣ron keep you by Reynawde, for if all the other knyghtes in the felawshyp were suche as ye be: Barbas shoulde be discomfited or noone, and whan al the barons were wel armed and wel on horsebacke: they ordeined theyr battailles as wel as they could. And than came the admyrall barbas that smot in to thoste of the christen. The fyrste barrailie of the sarasins was conduited by a king that had to name Margarys that was lord of the tow∣re of Tailes, whiche was ryght cru∣ell, and dare in his armes a dragon pyctured with an horryble fygure.</P>
<P>WHan the kyng Margaris sawe it was time to smite vpon the christen: he spur∣red his horse with his spurres &amp; ran ayenst Reinawd. And whan Reinaw¦de saw him come: he said to therle of rames, Heere cometh one to seeke his death with great haste, ye haue doon me great honoure, but this king shal haue dyshonoure for your loue at the fyrst. And whan Reinawd had saide this: he spurred his horse and ranne ayenst Margarys so harde that no∣ther sheelde nor quyras could not sa∣ue him, but he shoued his spere tho∣rough the brest and ouerthrew sterke dead to the grounde. And whan Rei∣nawde had gyuen that great stroke: he saide. Goe thy waye to helle the deuill spede thee and beare felawship to thy predecessours that went there afore thee. And after he put hande to the swerde and smot another sara∣sin so harde throughe the helme that he cloue him to the teethe, and forthe withall he taught another vnder the bauere so that he made his heade to flee from the shoulders, and whan he had slain these three: he cried Moun∣tawban vpon these panyms. And whan Mawgis hearde hym: he put himselfe amonge the Turkes so cou∣ragyously, that the first that he recoū¦tred he sent him downe in to helle, and than tooke his swerd in his han¦de and dyd merueylles of armes so that he slewe so many turkes that rei∣nawde and the barons meruaylled greatly. Than saide Reinawde to the earle of Rames. What say you by my cosin Mawgis, saw you euer so good an hermyte? By my soule said therle
<PB N="cli" REF="156"/> he is to be commended, blessed be the wombe that bare hym, and thoure y<SUP>e</SUP> ye ben come in to this londe, for now I am well sure that Iherusalem shal be recouered, &amp; the king Thomas de∣lyuered out of prison with the grace of God. Whan therle of Rames had sayde this to Reynawde: he spurred his horse with the spurres and smote a turke such a stroke that he made the yren of his spere to apeece at the back of him that he fel dead to therth, &amp; af∣ter he tooke his swerde in his hand &amp; began to crye Rames as hie as he coulde, sayinge barons smite nowe a good, for the persians shall be nowe vtterly dyscomfyted, yf god keep the valliaunt Reynawd of Mountawbā &amp; his valiaūt cosin Mawgis. Now is the houre come that the traytoure Barbas shall finish his life, that th{us} betraied the holy citie of Iherusalem by his false wit. Than did set on the barons of the londe, whiche began to make merueiles of armes ayenst the sarasins. Who had seene that tyme Reynawde and Mawgis how they made way to them that cam after thē: he wolde haue meruailled greatly, for I promise you none durst abide afore them were he neuer so hardy or valli∣aunt, but he was slayne of them. Af∣ter Reinawde and Mawgys, was therle of Rames, Geffray of Nasa∣reth, and wallerauen of fayete, with their folke, and thei made merueilles of armes ayenst their enemies, and whan the sarasins sawe that they could not abide the greate domage of that the christē bare to them: they put them selfe to flyght taward the citie.</P>
<P>WHan thadmirall Barbas sawe that his folke were dyscomfited: he was an∣gry for it &amp; said whoresōnes, whi doo ye slee thus awai know you not thus I am your lorde, that shal defend you ayenst this vnhappy christēs? Where is Margaris become that I see hym not?

Muche sory was thadmiral for the death of Margaris, and swo∣re the god mahoune that he shoulde perse the herte in his bely. And whan he had made this oth: he gaue y<SUP>e</SUP> spur∣res to the horse and put him selfe to the medle, and the first that he recoun∣tred: was wallerauen of fayete to whom he gaue such a stroke thorough the sheeld that he made his spere head to apere out at the backe of hym and slewe him dead to the erthe. And whā the admyrall had giuen that stroke: he put hande to his swerde and shoued him amonge the thickest, crying per∣cie as hie as he coulde, and saide ba∣rons smite vpon this vnhappy chri∣stens, for now shal they be discomfy∣ted. And whan therle Iaffas &amp; Gef∣fray of nasareth saw that thadmyrall fared so foule with the christens: they put them in to the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ece amonge the Sarasyns, and there was grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB REF="157"/> slaughter made of both partyes, but at the last the christen had ben shrew∣dely handled if Reinawd and maw∣nys had not come lyghtly there, Rei∣nawde that sawe this harde batayll shoued him selfe amonge the thickest as a wolfe among a flocke of sheep and smot a persian that was cosin to thadmyrall that had to name Or∣rende, and gaue him such a stroke w<SUP>t</SUP> his swerde: that he made his heade to slee wel a spere lengthe from his bo∣dye with helme and all. And after he smote a nother that was neuewe to Malbon, so that he slewe both horse and man with one stroke. To say the trouth Reinawd made there so great merueylles of armes: that al the pai∣nymes were fore abashed, for he had hys sheelde cast behynde his backe, and held the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eyne of hys horse about hys arme, and helde his swerde in bothe his handes and habandonned his body smytyng merueyllous stro∣kes on ether side vpon the sarasyns so that he smot no stroke but he slew a turke or paynim. And whan thad∣myr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> sawe the great greef that Rei∣nawd bare to his folke: he sware his god appo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lyn he shoulde neuer eate meate till he had slaine the great vil∣lain.

<P>MVche cruell and harde was the medlyng. Mawgis was there that made great occysyon fro the one syde and fro the other. And whan rei∣nawde saw Mangis that did so wel: he was glad, and so smot he a turke vpon his helme suche a stroke that he cleued his head in two peeces, and so he smot a nother at the sydes so y<SUP>t</SUP> he cleued all his ribbes, and cut al to gyther a sundre his bodye, and after this he smot a nother so that he hew∣ed his heade clene of, &amp; one of his ar∣mes, and whan he had slain these .iii. with one enpraint: he cried moūtaw∣ban saying, smite barons, for the sa∣rasins bothe turkes &amp; persians been dead &amp; ouerthrowen, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nke to auenge your lord Thomas, which is so excellent a king. And whā thadmi¦ral barbas heard cry mountawban: this worde abashed hym more than any other thinge, for he anewe well than that he that his men called the great carie with y<SUP>e</SUP> forke: Was y<SUP>e</SUP> vali∣aunt Reynawd of mountawban, of whome he had heard speake of many tymes afore that, and that he was y<SUP>e</SUP> best knight of al the worlde, and whā he knewe this: he wold ful fayne ha∣ue be again in percie, &amp; than he tooke his way anon to ward the citye as a man discomfited and ouerthrowen, and drewe to the gate fore for to haue gone in to it, but the vallyaunte erle of Rames pursued him so nyghe that he suffered him not to goe at his wil. And than the admyrall sawe that he was so sore pursued: he was aferde to be take, and so he smote his horse with his spurres and gat in
<PB N="Clii" REF="157"/> to the citie with great payne, &amp; lefte all his folke behinde and saued hym selfe, but the moste parte of his men were there slayne. And whan Rey∣nawde wyste that the admirall of percie was so scaped: he was right sory for it, and than he looked about him and saw there a great peece of tībre that had .xv. foote of length, he lyghted downe a foote and tooke the balke and trussed it vp afore hym v∣pon his horse necke as lyghtly as it had be some peece of welow.

And after he had be thought hymselfe therof: he went on his way with the christens as faste as they coulde runne towarde the gate of Iherusalem, where the ad∣myrall had saued hymseflfe, &amp; whan he came there: he sawe the gate open wherof he was glad, so tooke he thā his beme and put it vnder the port colisfe, so that it myght not be lette downe, nor y<SUP>e</SUP> gate could not be shyt nother, but ye may well know that Reynawde dyd not this w<SUP>t</SUP>out great trauayle, for there was so many bo∣dyes bothe quycke &amp; dead in his wai that he myght not well helpe hym self, but one thyng helped hym wel, for whan the Sarasyns saw hym: they were so fearde of hym that they made him waye, &amp; fled all afore him.</P>
<P>WHan the noble knyght Rey∣nawde saw that y<SUP>e</SUP> porte co∣lisse was well faste vpon the beme that he had brought there: without any tarying he put hād to his swerd and put hymself within Iherusalē. And whan he was in: he began to crye as hye as he myght Mountaw∣ban, Moūtawban, the citie is wōne and made there so muche of armes y<SUP>e</SUP> Mawgys the Erle of Rames, and many other barons gate in by fyne force. And whan the Sarasyns saw that the christens were within the citie: they put themself so to flyght, &amp; hyd them within the houses, where as they might for to saue theyr lyues and alwayes Reynawde was at the gate for to keep the entre. They that were vpon the greate towre of Da∣uid: cryed fast to the other sarasyns that they should shet the gate, sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g that yf y<SUP>e</SUP> great lurden entred within they should be all lost. And whā Rei∣nawde saw that a great parte of the christens were within Iherusalem: he sayd to Mawgis, Cosyn keep wel thys passage, and I shall go at ano∣ther gate for to make it open. Cosyn sayd Mawgis goe your way harde∣lye and doubt nothyng, I shall well keep this path. Than departed Rei∣nawde accompanyed with many va∣lyaunt
<PB REF="158"/> Christians and went vnto a nother gate whiche he founde well garnysshed with paynyms but Rey∣nawde thoroughe his prowes put them anon to flyght and gat y<SUP>e</SUP> gate open. Thus as ye heare was doone for all the sarasyns lost theyr lyues and was recouered agayne the Citie of Iherusalem, through the greate prowes of the noble Reynawde of Mountawban. And whan the ad∣myrall sawe this: he wende to haue wexe mad all quicke and fared as he had be out of his witte and cur∣sed his goddes mahowmet &amp; Appo∣lyn, &amp; pulled his heres of his berde, and rent all hys raymentes, and af∣ter he sayd. By Apollo the souerayn God, yf Thomas helpe me not to saue my lyfe: I shall make hym to be slayne incontinent, and than he sent for the kyng Thomas and sayd vn∣to hym. Kynge Thomas yee muste chuse of two thinges thone, that is that ye must saue my lyfe y<SUP>t</SUP> I maye goo to percie agayne with two of my men in my felawship: or els yee to be now cast out of these wyndo∣wes downe. Than sayde the kynge Thomas, &amp; please you, ye shal haue paciente that I may speake with my folke. Go on said the admyral to thē at this wyndow, For no ferther yee shal not go, and delyuer you lyght∣ly. Than went the kinge Thomas to the windowes, &amp; saw Reynawde of Mountawban &amp; Mawgys come that cam al the formest for to sawte the towre of Dauyd, where he was prysoner to the admirall. And whā he sawe Reynawde and Mawgys y<SUP>e</SUP> formest of all: he knewe them not, &amp; looked ferther, &amp; saw the erle of Ra∣mes behynde them whiche he knew not well, and thā he aspied Geffray of Nazareth, wherof he was glad whan he saw him, and than he begā to crye. Lorde of Nazareth looke vp to your king that is heere prysoner, the admyrall Barbas sendeth you worde that if ye let him not goe sauf into his countrie and realme of per¦tie wyth two of his men with him: he shall caste me nowe downe out of thys windowe. Than answered to hym therle of Rames, ha good kyng god saue you, ye wot well y<SUP>t</SUP> a good man ought not to make anye lye, it is trouth that yesterdaye wee made our gouerner, &amp; mayster of that lorde that ye see heere afore vs, whiche is the best knyght of the worlde and to hym ye must shew your need, for w<SUP>t</SUP>∣out hym we may doo nothyng. And whan the kyng Thomas vnderstode this tidinge: he wexed almoste oute of hys wit for sorow, bycause he wēd none other, but he should die an euil death. Than sayd he to y<SUP>e</SUP> erle of Ra∣mes in great angre. Ha erle of Ra∣mes, haue ye betrayed me so, that yee haue made a nother Lorde than me? Syr sayde the Erle to hym agayne doubt nothyng, for wee haue doone so, your ryght and honour is alway saued in this behalfe, nor ye shal not lese nothyng of your owne, for the good knight hath ynough in fraūce and ye must know that he hath takē this citie, he and his felow, and take no suspecciyon of hym nor of vs, for I am sure he shall doo euyn as yee wil yourself, for he is heere for none other cause but for to delyuer you,
<PB N="cliii" REF="158"/> for as soone as he shall haue vysit the holy sepulcre of our lorde: he shal goe agayne to Fraunce. Than sayd the kynge Thomas, lordes how is the knyght named? Syr sayd therle of Rames, he is called Reynawde of Mountawban, the sonne of y<SUP>e</SUP> Duke Aymon, and the best knyght of the worlde, For he is suche a knyght y<SUP>t</SUP> the great kyng Charlemayne might neuer greue hym, and yet haue they mayntened the warre .xv. yeres and more the one against thother, and so hath he doone so many noble &amp; great faytes of armes during the warre: y<SUP>t</SUP> the renōme therof is flowen ouer al the worlde. Erle of Lames sayd the kynge, I pray you that ye wyll tell hym in my behalfe this that I haue sayd to Geffray of nazareth, syr said therle wyth a good wyll I shall doo so. And than he went to Reynawde &amp; shewed to him al that the king had sayd. Lordes sayd Reinawd we shal not doo so, but let vs sawte y<SUP>e</SUP> towre for at worst fall, we shall alwayes wel haue that apoyntement y<SUP>t</SUP> thad∣myral asketh, &amp; so I tell you yf we sawte wel: the towre shalbe lyghtly wonne by force of armes, &amp; we shal deliuer the kinge Thomas at oure owne wyll, &amp; so shal we slea barbas that thorough treason tooke y<SUP>e</SUP> citie. Syr sayd therle of Rames, we shall doo your cōmaundement doubt not of it, Thā commaūded Reynawd y<SUP>t</SUP> the towre should be sawted of al sid{is} &amp; made great plētie of ladders to be ryghted agaynst it, &amp; he hymselfe be∣gan fyrst to clime vp with his sheeld for to couer him with, and after him went Mawgis &amp; than therle of Ra∣mes, &amp; after them Geffray of Naza∣reth &amp; wel thyrty knightes mo, and men with crosbowes &amp; other archers abode byneth for to shoot vpwarde, where they saw sarasins looke oute &amp; whan thadmirall saw Reynawde y<SUP>t</SUP> wolde haue come into y<SUP>e</SUP> towre: he was sore aferde, so wyst he not what he should doo, but ranne to the kinge Thomas &amp; caught hym by the necke &amp; sayd to hī, by apollo thou &amp; I shall lepe bothe at once out of this win∣dow. Sir sayd the king kill not your self nor me also, for I shall make y<SUP>e</SUP> sawte to cesse. I will wel y<SUP>t</SUP> ye doo so sayd thadmiral, but ye shal come with me. So tooke hym by the neck &amp; had him to the wyndowe &amp; sayd al hye Reynawde of Mountawban I shall angre you, for I shall caste the king Thomas downe if ye pardon me not, &amp; I shall slea my self whim, for I may wel die after such a king. And whan the duke Riynawde saw that the kyng Thomas hynge thus the head downewarde all redy for to fall: he had great pitie of hym &amp; said Ha good lorde what shal I doo? for if I leue the sawte: it shalbe greate shame, for y<SUP>e</SUP> towre is almoste taken, and of the other part it shalbe great mysshape yf y<SUP>e</SUP> good kinge Thomas take death for it. Th{us} as Reynawde was vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> ladder thynkyng what he might best doo: al the barons of y<SUP>e</SUP> lande began to crye to Reynawde, sweete syr suffre not that our kynge lese his lyfe, so it were great shame to vs and to you also. Lordes sayde Reynawde by the fayth that I owe to my bretherne and to my Cosyn Mawgys, I wolde not y<SUP>t</SUP> the kynge
<PB REF="159"/> should take death for me, and whan he had sayd so: he came downe fro the ladder, and after cryed to the admi∣rall. Leue the kyng Thomas &amp; doo hym no harme, for ye shalbe deliue∣red by suche a couenaūt that yee and your two men shall go on foote into percie and ye shall leue here al your goods. By mahoūe sayd thadmiral I wyll not doo so but shall ryde on horsebacke I and my two men, &amp; so shal ye gyue me saufconduyt vpon your fayth, &amp; if ye wil not doo thus: I shall let fall downe y<SUP>e</SUP> kyng Tho∣mas. Admyrall sayd Reynawde, y<SUP>e</SUP> ye aske I graunt it to you vpon my fayth, For ye haue with you suche a pledge that ye shal not be touched at this time for me. Thadmirall was ryght glad whā he heard Reynawde speake thus, so drew he vp the kyng Thomas agayne and sayde to hym, kyng Thomas ye shall go quite frō me, and than he wente downe with the kyng &amp; opened the gate, &amp; went our he &amp; his two men. There was made great ioye betwene the kynge Thomas and Reynawde. And after of all the other barons of surre, and the great thankes that the kyng did to Reynawde and to Mawgis: are not for to be named, &amp; the langage y<SUP>e</SUP> was betwene them are to longe to be recounted. After this thadmyral tooke his saufconduyt and went his way towarde percie. Heere of him is made none other mencion, and after he was gone: y<SUP>e</SUP> king Thomas, rey∣nawde &amp; w<SUP>t</SUP> all thother barons wēt togyther into y<SUP>e</SUP> towre, &amp; whā they were come vp: the kynge Thomas kneeld afore Reynawde. Syr sayde Reyaawde ye ought not to doo so. Yes verely sayd the kynge, &amp; whan Reynawde saw that he wexed red for shame and tooke vp the kyng &amp; thā the kyng colled hym and sayd. Bles∣sed be our lorde that brought you in thys lande, for ye haue succoured Iherusalem the holy citie &amp; brought miself out of the sarasins handes.</P>
<P>Now tell me and it please you if ye haue made peace w<SUP>t</SUP> Charlemayn y<SUP>e</SUP> great kynge of Fraūce y<SUP>t</SUP> hath doon you so great hinderaunce. Syr sayde Reynawde yea, &amp; bycause of y<SUP>e</SUP> peace I am come heere, begging my bread &amp; poorely arayed, and whā the king Thomas heard him speake: he had great pitie of him, and swore by the holy Sepulcre that he should araye hym honourably as to hym apper∣teineth for to returne into Fraunce. After that the kynge had sayd thys worde: they came downe fro y<SUP>e</SUP> towre of dauyd for to go to the holy sepul∣cre. And ye ought to wit y<SUP>t</SUP> they made great feast through out the Citie of that was so befall. Thā went they al to the holy sepulcre, for to yeelde thākes to our lorde of the citie that was recouered fro the handes of y<SUP>e</SUP> sarasyns. And whan all this was doone the barons of surre tooke leue of the kyng of Reynawde &amp; of maw¦gis, &amp; after went euery man into hys place in theyr coūtrey, &amp; the kīg toke Reynawde &amp; Mawgis and brought them to hys palays where he feasted them a hundred dayes honourablye. And this hanging: he shewed them all the crountrey aboute Iherusalē, &amp; whā Reynawde had sported him ynough with the king Thomas: he
<PB N="cliiii" REF="159"/> wolde depart for to go agayne into y<SUP>e</SUP> marches of fraūce. And whan the kyng saw that: he gaue to Reynawd many riche giftes, as horses, silkes gold &amp; syluer &amp; many other thynges in great plenti. And ye ought to wit that Mawgis wolde take nothyng nor chaunge his hermites araye in no wyse, but arayed hym agayne as a pylgrime and bare foote, wher∣of Reynawde was sory. The kynge made a ship be redy honourabli at y<SUP>e</SUP> hauen of Iaphes, Reynawde ful tē∣derly weepyng tooke leue of y<SUP>e</SUP> kyng &amp; of his barons, and entred into the ship. And wit it y<SUP>t</SUP> by fortune of we∣dryng, they were well eyght mone∣thes vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> sea, &amp; at last they tooke lande at a towne called Palerne, &amp; whan they had takē land: Reinawde commaunded that the ship should be vnlade, &amp; al thus as they vnladed y<SUP>e</SUP> ship: the king of Palerne which was called Simon af puill loking out at a wyndow of his castel, than he said to them that were aboute hym, I see yonder in the hauen a shyp setteth her good a lande, and it cannot be but there muste be some great man in it, for I see horses that bē had out &amp; great riches, I cannot say what it may be, but it were pilgrimes, thā he commaunded an horse for to be made redy: for he wolde sporte him∣selfe to the hauen syde.</P>
<P>THe valyaūt kyng Symon of Puill w<SUP>t</SUP>out any more tary∣eng: came to the sea syde with many a noble knyght in his companye. And whan he was come to y<SUP>e</SUP> hauen: he founde Reynawde y<SUP>t</SUP> was come a lande, &amp; assone as the king saw him: he knew hym well, wherof he was ryght glad, &amp; also Reynawde knew wel the good king Symon. So thā enbraced they eche with other, and made great cheare thone to thother Reynawde sayd y<SUP>e</SUP> kyng, ye be ryght welcome, I pray you come lodge in my castell, for thadmyral barbas is entred in my lande &amp; wasteth it day∣ly. I fought yesterday with him, but he droue me out of the feelde shame∣fully &amp; dyd great harme to my folke &amp; I am sure he shal come to besyege me to morowe, &amp; I had thought to haue sende for succours towarde Charlemayn, but sith that god hath brought you heere: I feare not the kyng nother his admiral of Percie.</P>
<P>Syr said Reynawd I make you sure I shall helpe you withal my power, &amp; if thadmyrall come to morowe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he shall not mysse of batayle, for I shal neuer eat bread till I haue discom∣fited him. Than the kinge Simon brought Reynawde to hys palays, where he made him good cheere, and thus as Simon feasted Reynawde came there a knight that was called Ymes that said to the king Simon Syr thadmyrall of Percie is come before Palerne with so great folke that all therth is couered withall. Whan the kynge vnderstoode these tidinges: he was sory for it and Rey∣nawde glad. Than sayd Reynawde to the kynge. Syr I pray you be not abasshed of nothynge, for this daye shall ye be auēged and god before, &amp; the holy sepulcre fro whens I came but late, and whan the kyng hearde Reynawde speake so: he made be cried that euery mā should arme hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB REF="160"/> self, and whan Reynawde saw that: he sent for his herneys and armed hym, and sware the body of God he should doo greet to thadmyral y<SUP>t</SUP> dai sith that he had found hym agayne. And whan Mawgys saw that Rey∣nawde wolde arme him for to fight: he sayd to hym. My cosyn I am yet dysposed for your loue to beare ar∣mes, for I coulde not suffre you in daunger. And whan the king Sy∣mon hearde Mawgis speake so: he sayd hym great thanke, and went &amp; enbraced hym and after sayd, by my soule heere is a good Hermite for whan it was need he put wel hand to the swerde. Syr sayd Reynawde ye say well trouth, and I promyse you men, should fynde in the worlde but few suche knightes as he is one After all these thynges sayde: euery man tooke his harneys and y<SUP>e</SUP> kinge all armed went to Mawgys &amp; sayd al laughyng. My freend Mawgis I pray you that ye wyl beare my stan∣darde this day. Syr answerde maw¦gys yf ye take me it: I promyse you I shall haue it in suche a place that ye shall swete or euer ye shall come to me. And whan the kynge hearde Mawgys speake so: he was ryght glad therof, and than he tooke him hys baner. And whan Mawgis had it in his hande: he sayd to the kynge syr now folow me that wil, for this day shall thadmyral be discomfited yf it please God, &amp; whan Mawgys had sayd so: he gaue the spurres to his horse &amp; put himself amonge the sarasyns as a lyon. Reynawde fo∣lowed him nighe &amp; recountred a per∣sian, whome he smote with his spere so great a stroke that he made hym tumble dead to the ground, wherof thother were sore abasshed &amp; after he put hande to hys swearde &amp; shoued himself into y<SUP>e</SUP> greatest prece &amp; smote on eyther syde of him vpon the per∣sians so meruailouse strokes, y<SUP>t</SUP> they were greatly meruayled w<SUP>t</SUP> it, for al they that he hit: he brought theym to thyr ending, and whan thadmyrall saw the great efforce of armes y<SUP>e</SUP> Rei∣nawde made agaynst hys folke: he sayd to a neuew of hys that was by hym. By mahoune I saw not yester¦day that great mā of armes, nother he that beareth now the baner of Si∣mon, from whens the deuil are they come that so greatly greueth vs? I see wel they be some straunge knigh¦tes. I am all redy so feard of them that all the bloud in my body trem∣bleth. This hangyng: the kyng Sy∣mon &amp; Reynawde made great slau∣ghter of the sarasyns. But whā the admiral saw that hys folke bare thē∣selfe so yll: he wyst not whether he wolde flee or abyde. Than came rey∣nawde brekyng the prece that cried as loude as he could, mountawban. And whan thadmiral heard that cry he was sore a ferde y<SUP>t</SUP> he wyst not whe¦ther to go but sayd by mahoune I be¦leue y<SUP>t</SUP> this deuil helpeth himself w<SUP>t</SUP> some deuilry, for I left him in Ihe∣rusalem, and now he is heere.</P>
<P>THan whan thadmyral Bar∣bas knew that he y<SUP>t</SUP> made so great greef to his folke was Rey∣nawde of moūtawbā: he shooke al for feare &amp; said to his neuew. by ma∣chomet my god, we haue doone yll to come heere for to make warre a¦gaynst
<PB N="clv" REF="160"/> the king Simon, syth that he hath this deuill Reynawde of moun¦tawban, for his like is there not in all the worlde of knighthoode, now wolde I be wel in my ship in the mid¦des of the sea, for yf I abyde hym: he shall make an ende of me. Syr sayde his folke haue no doubt of y<SUP>e</SUP> greate vilayn, for and he come ones in our handes: he shal not lyghtly scape vs lordes sayd thadmyral, ye wot not what ye say, ye know not the greate prowes of Reynawde, for &amp; we were ten times mo folke than we ben: yet should not we endure agaynst hym, &amp; therfore by y<SUP>e</SUP> fayth that I owe to mahoune I wil abide heere no len∣ger. And whā he had sayd these wor∣des: he turned y<SUP>e</SUP> brydel, &amp; as sone as he might fled towarde his galays, &amp; al his folke after him. And whan Reynawde saw y<SUP>t</SUP> the paynems were discomfited: he began to crye, after Mawgis after for the truaūtes are discomfited. And whan he had sayd so: he put hymselfe to the chase, &amp; the king Simon after him, &amp; went ca∣styng downe Sarasyns as beastes. And wyt y<SUP>t</SUP> they slew so many of thē that men should not beleue the num¦bre, but they coulde not take thadmi¦rall: for he was the formest.</P>
<P>BArbas the admyrall of Persie, whan he founde hymself saued in his shyp: he began to looke a lande and saw the great domage that Rei∣nawde &amp; Mawgys made of hys fol∣ke, for all the shores of the sea were ful of sarasīs slayne, wherof he had great sorow, so began he to pull his heres of his berde, &amp; cursed thoure y<SUP>t</SUP> euer he was borne. Reynawde came to the shores &amp; saw that thadmyrall was saued, wherof he was full sory &amp; wyst not what he should doo more to him, but he made to be cast boltes of wylde fyre into the galley of thad∣myrall, so that he brent y<SUP>e</SUP> moste part of it, and Barbas was fayne to en∣tre into another ship. And ye ought to wyt that all y<SUP>e</SUP> sarasins that bode a land: lost theyr liues. whan y<SUP>e</SUP> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Simō saw that he was to his aboue of his enemies: he was ryght glad of it, so ranne he and enbraced Rey∣nawde and after sayde to hym. Rey∣nawde I know wel that I am kīg by your prowes, for &amp; ye had not be the admirall Barbas had distroyed me, and had made an ende of me, wherfore it is reason that ye be re∣warded for it, &amp; therfore (Reynawd) I make you lorde of all my goodes &amp; of all my lande. Than sayde Rey∣nawde, syr I thanke you muche of your good wyl, for we be not they y<SUP>t</SUP> haue discomfyted the sarasyns. It was god and none other, for we be not so puyssaunt, I and Mawgys for to doo it without him. And whā they had thus spoken together a lōg whyle at the sea syde: the kyng tooke Reynawde with the one hande, and Mawgys with the other hande, and went to warde the Citie. And whan they were come there: the king made the gayne to be brought, &amp; presented it to Reynawde and to Mawgys, wherof Reinawde &amp; Mawgis wolde take nothynge, but gaue it to the poore knightes, &amp; incōtinent Maw∣gis tooke agayn his hermites werd Than began y<SUP>e</SUP> feast to be there great
<PB REF="161"/> for the victorye that god had giuen them. The cheere that y<SUP>e</SUP> kyng made to Reynawde in his paleys is not for to say, for it was great, and for to make shorte tale: Reynawde was honourably feasted y<SUP>e</SUP> space of foure dayes. And than he woulde departe, &amp; asked leue of the kynge, wherof the kyng was ful sory bycause he wolde bide no lenger, and whan he sawe y<SUP>t</SUP> he wolde go: he gaue him mani fayre giftes, &amp; made his ship to be garnis∣shed w<SUP>t</SUP> muche good vitayles. And whan this was doone: Reynawde tooke leue of the kyng Symon &amp; of hys barons, and the kyng conueyed Reynawde to the shyp. And whan he came to the patting: the king Simō kissed Reynawde sore weepyng, and after went agayne to Palerne, and Reynawde did doo hale vp saile and tooke sea, &amp; ceassed neuer tyl he cam to Rome, and there they tooke lande and he and Mawgys went and cō∣fessed them to the Pope, and whan they were confessed: they returned a∣gayne into the shyp and tooke theyr way towarde Fraunce. Shortly to speake they dyd so muche by theyr iourneys y<SUP>t</SUP> they came to Ardeyne a∣bout noone, &amp; whan y<SUP>e</SUP> pleople of A∣deyne wist y<SUP>e</SUP> Reynawde &amp; Mawgis were comyng? they were neuer so glad, &amp; went to alarde and sayd, wit y<SUP>t</SUP> your brother Reynawde our lorde is come and also Mawgis your co∣sin whole and soūd thanked be god.</P>
<P>ANd than whan Alarde and hys brethern heard these ty∣dynges of theyr brother Reynawde y<SUP>t</SUP> was come? they had almost swou∣ned for great ioye that they had, and anon went to the gate of the towne agaynst theyr brother, but they foūd him y<SUP>t</SUP> he was all redy in the towne, &amp; whan they saw him: they ran him agaynst and Alarde enbraced hym fyrst weepyng. and after kyssed him by great loue &amp; in likewyse dyd Gui∣charde and Richarde, and thā kissed mawgis theyr good cosin. And whā they had thus welcomed hym: they wēt together in y<SUP>e</SUP> palays, &amp; whā thei were therr, Alarde said to Reynawd fayre brother tell, vs howe ye haue founde out cosyn mawgis. Brother sayd Reynawde I founde him in cō∣stantinople bi fortune, &amp; than he be∣gan to reherse vnto them all his ad∣uentures that he had sith he became pilgrime. And whan he had tolde al he looked on his brother Alarde in his face &amp; saw he was pale, whiche gaue hym suspeccion &amp; sayde. Fayre brother now is it with my wyfe and mi children? I meruaile me moche y<SUP>t</SUP> I see them not heere.

And than whā Reynawde hearde good tydynges of hys wyfe &amp; of his children: he was right glad of it, and so he kneeled downe and thanked God of it.</P>
<P>WHan Reynawde knew that hys wyfe &amp; his childrē were wel: it recōforted him muche &amp; begā
<PB N="Clvi" REF="161"/> to make good cheere, but whā he saw that his brethern made no great ioy he meruayled muche: so turned hym selfe towarde Alarde y<SUP>e</SUP> syghed sore and sayd to hym. Brother I awayte for to heare some heuye tidinges I trowe that, that ye haue tolde me is not trouth, and if ye tel me not how is it of al: I shall go fro my self, and therfore I pray you tell it me, for I wyll know it. Whā alarde saw that Reynawde helde him so short: he be∣gan to weepe full tenderly and than said vnto him. Sir sith that it please you that I tell you the trouth: I shal doo so. Wit it that my lady your wife is deceassed out of this worlde vnto god. For euer sithe y<SUP>t</SUP> ye departed she ceassed not her sorow for nothynge that we could doo or shew vnto her. And than she cast all her clothynge into a fyre and wolde neuer were v∣pon her but a sory mātel &amp; a smocke, &amp; so longe she wept and sorowed dai and night that she died at last, wher¦of I am sory for it, for she was the goodliest and the fayrest of all the worlde. Whā Reynawde vnderstode these wordes: he swouned downe to the erth for great sorowe y<SUP>t</SUP> he tooke at his herte of the death of the good duchesse Clare his wyfe, &amp; whan he was come agayne to himself: he be∣gan to weepe &amp; sayd, Ha king Char¦lemayne, how wel may I hate you? by you haue I lost my wife, for she is dead bycause she se that ye chased me out of Fraunce with so great shame to make me goe a foote, begging my bread lyke a truaunt, but I knewe well that my sinnes ben cause of al this. And whā Reynawde had made hys mone: he sayd to Alarde his bro∣ther, fayre brother I pray you come &amp; shew me the tombe where my wyfe is begrauen.

And whā Reynawde cam there he swouned three times vpon her tombe, and whā he was come again to himselfe: began to make great so∣row, for he rented his clothes and pulled his hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es. And whan he had sorowed longe: he said as a man re∣plenysshed with sorow. Ha god what a pylgrym I am. I beleue that there is none in the worlde more vnhappi than I am: Now see I wel that I haue lost all my ioye and my cōforte syth that I haue lost the fayrest lady of the worlde and the goodliest. And as he was speakyng these wordes: came there his children Aymonet &amp; yonnet that kneeled before theyr fa∣ther. And whan Reynawde saw the kneelyng afore him: he wēd his hert should haue brest. So tooke he them vp and kissed them by great loue all weepynge, and after sayd to them. Mi fayre children see rhat ye be good men, for I fere me that ye shal misse me soone. And whan Reynawde had sayd this to his children: he be∣gan to make more sorow than he had doone afore &amp; so did Mawgis. Thā begā the sorow through al the towne right great, and lasted .x. dayes with¦out cease, and whan came to the .xiii. daye: Reynawde tooke hys way towarde Mountawban that was almoste as well peopled as it was or the warre began. And Mawgys
<PB REF="162"/> habādonned neuer reynawde where someuer he went but went alwayes on foote in his hermites araye, and as they went thus to Mountawbā: the brethern of Reynawd &amp; his chil¦dren went on foote for to bere com∣pany to Mawgys theyr cosin. And whan they of Mountawban knewe y<SUP>e</SUP> coming of theyr lorde: they were ryght glad of it, &amp; made al y<SUP>e</SUP> streetes for to be hanged with fayre clothes, &amp; they came agaynst him al together makyng great ioye, and made hym great reuerence, &amp; welcomed him ho∣nourably. And Reynawde receyued them gladly &amp; made thē good cheere, for at that tyme he dyssimuled hys sorowe y<SUP>t</SUP> he had at his hert, bycause he should not dyscomfort hys folke y<SUP>t</SUP> so great ioy made for hys comyng And also they of Moūtawban wel∣comed mawgis honourably, bicause they loued him of olde very well, &amp; thē they brought Reinawde making great ioye vnto the castell, and whā Reynawde founde himself wythin hys castell of Mountawban: he was glad of it, and came to a window &amp; looked downe into the towne, &amp; saw that it was as well peopled as euer it was, and had meruayle of whens so muche people was come there for to dwell &amp; he was ryght glad of it, for he wēde neuer to haue seen moū¦tawban in that plyght as it was be∣fore the warre began. After that the feast was ended: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eynawde called his brethern &amp; sayd vnto them. Lor∣des I holde me destroyed for loue of y<SUP>e</SUP> good duchesse, whiche I haue lost wherof I am ryght heuy for it, for loue of y<SUP>e</SUP> great goodnes that I haue knowen in her, I make my vowe to god that neuer whyle I lyue I shall neuer mary agayn. Cosin sayd maw¦gys ye doo well, but I praye you re∣comforte yourselfe, for ye know wel that a thynge that may not be amen∣ded must be left alone. Cosyn sayde Reynawde ye say well &amp; I shall doo so.

<P>IN this party sheweth thistory that after that Mawgys was erturned agayne to his hermitage, Reynawde was euer after sory for hym &amp; also for his wyfe. But he re∣comforted hymself as wel as he mi∣ght with his brethern. A long while. abode Reynawde with his brethern making as good cheere as he could, and wit it that aboute that tyme di∣ed the olde duke Aymon which left greate goodes to his children, but shortly to speket Reinawde departed &amp; gaue all his goodes as well that, he had of his owne, as y<SUP>t</SUP> was fal∣len by the death of his father Aymō vnto hys brethern except onlye y<SUP>t</SUP> he reteyned for himself the castell and town of Mountawban, and found the wayes that they were al maryed noble &amp; rychely. Who y<SUP>t</SUP> should speke of the brethern of Reynawde and of theyr dedes: it were to long to be re∣coūted. Reynawde thā dwelled lōge at Mountawban with his children which he endoctrined &amp; taught in al good and vertuous maners as wel as he could, &amp; nouryshed them tyll y<SUP>t</SUP> they were men, and coulde beare bothe sheelde and spere. And vpon a daye he had theym to the feelde on horsebacke, and made to be brought there speres and sheeldes for to assay themselfe, and tooke with hym twē∣ty knightes, whome whan they were comen in the feeld: he made his chil∣dren to iuste with. And ye ought to wit that y<SUP>e</SUP> two sonnes of Reynawd Iusted as well as thoughe they had be hauntynge the warre ten yeares
<PB REF="163"/> &amp; more. And whan Reynawde saw that they did so wel: he called theym afore hym &amp; afore the knyghtes and sayd to them. My fayre children thā¦ked be our lorde, ye be raile men and well made of body. It is now tyme that ye were made knyghtes, wher∣fore I wyl that ye go serue the king Charlemayne your souereyne lorde whyche shall make you knyghts, for or more noble hande ye canne not be dowbed to the noble ordre of knight hode. Syr sayd Aymonet, we are re∣dy to fulfyll your wyl in euery thing y<SUP>t</SUP> ye commaunde vs. Father sayde Yonnet ye say well to vs, for it is ty∣me that we folow the warres, but sith it is your pleasure to sende vs to Charlemayne: We must go there ho∣nourabli, but it cānot be w<SUP>t</SUP>out great cost. My sonne sayd Reynawde, care not for the cost, for we haue good y∣noughe, gramercy our lorde, for to brynge you there accordyng to your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>state, &amp; I promise you, I shall sende you there or I be .vii. night elder as honourably as any went thither sin my tyme. Father sayd the childrē we are redy to goe whan it please you.</P>
<P>Whā Reynawde had sayd this to his children: he wente home agayne to Mountawbā wel ioyful of his two sonnes that proued so well, &amp; whan he was within his castell: he called his stewarde and sayd to hym. Ste∣warde I commaunde you that ye a∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay my childrē honorably &amp; richelye of diuerse maners of clothing and of thynges that longeth of them, for I wil send them to y<SUP>e</SUP> court of the king Charlemayne, for to be made knigh∣tes of hym, &amp; s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that they goe as ho∣nestly as any went thyther this .xx. yeres. My lorde sayd the stewarde, I shall wel doo your cōmaūdemēt sith y<SUP>t</SUP> it pleaseth you, for ye haue inough clothes full ryche of your owne of dyuerse colours.</P>
<P>WHan the stewarde heard y<SUP>e</SUP> cō∣maundement of hys mayster wythout anye taryeng he dyd right well al that was commaunded him by Reynawde, for he made to be redy many palfreis and coursers wel bar∣bed and couered wyth ryche cloth of golde with belles of siluer &amp; gylte in great plentye, and purueyed for two good harneyses al complete, for spe∣res &amp; swerdes and for al suche other thinges as a perteyneth for the two yonge bachelers. Shortli to speake: it was not possible to ataye better two yonge squiers than y<SUP>e</SUP> two yong sonnes of Reynawde were by y<SUP>e</SUP> pur∣ueyaunce of his stewarde, and whā all thinges were redy: he brought thē before his maysters.

With Charlemain were also many other greate prynces and barons wherof the booke maketh no mencion. For it were to long a thing for to be recounted.</P>
<P>THan whan the two brethern the sonnes of Reinawde of Mountawban were come in to the hall: they saw the kinge amonge his barons so went they vnto hym, and kneeled downe afore him, and kissed his feete. And than Aymonet spake first and said. Sir god giue you good life &amp; longe, and keepe from euill all youre noble companye. Sir we are come to you for to haue the ordre of knighthod, if it plese your good grace to giue it to vs, for of no better hand than is youres: We can not haue it, wherfore sir we beseche you humbly for god and for the loue of our father that it will please you to receyue vs in your seruise vnto the time ye giue the saide ordre of knightehode, who bē you said y<SUP>e</SUP> king that speake thus? Sir saide Aymonet, we are the son∣nes of Reynawde of Mountawban. And whan y<SUP>e</SUP> kyng Charlemayn vn∣derstoode that they were the sonnes of Reynawde: he rose vpon hys feet lyghtly and receyued them honoura∣bly, and after said vnto theym. My chyldrene, ye be righte welcome and how fareth your father? syr sayde the chylderne, he doothe well thanked be god, and he recommendeth him right hūbly to your good grace, beseeching you that ye will haue vs for recom∣mended, and we haue lefte hym at Mountawban, but he draweth now sore to age. Thus goeth the worlde my children (said the king) euery man must take in it an ende. Muche glad was the kynge Charlemayne of the comynge of the two sonnes of Reynawde, and ryght gladly he loo∣ked vpon theim for the loue of theyr father, for the more he behelde theim: and the more fayrer he founde th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im and better lyked theim, and well he loued theim, because they were lyke the father. And whā that he had loo∣ked vpon them ynough: he said to his barons. Lordes if the children wold forsake the father: they coulde not, for neuer children were more lyke to him, than they, &amp; whan he had sayde so: he turned roward the children and sayde to theym. Fayre childrene ye shall be made knightes at al tymes whan ye will, for the loue of youre father my good freend, and I shal gi∣ue you more londes than your father hath, and for loue of you: I shal ma∣ke an hundred knightes more with you, for ye ben of suche a stocke come that ye be worthy for to be honoured pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ised and holden dere.

And whan the childrē knew what that they were: they meeked themsele before theim honestlye and after yonnet sayde to theim. Lordes our father greteth you wel, and prai∣eth you that ye wyll haue vs for re∣commended as youre kynsmen. And than whan the barons heard the two children speake so wisely: they were glad of it and also of their comming. But the two sonnes of Foulques of Moryllon were full sory and wrothe for it, by my soule sayde Constans to his brother Rahars the father of the∣se two chyldrene slewe oure father, wherof the hert in my body swelleth highe for angre that I see them heere nother min eyen can not looke vpon them, brother said Rohars, nor I no∣ther by my trouthe, but I counseyll not that we fight with them not hee∣re, for it were foly. But let vs await a tyme and place couenable, for syth that they shall dwell heere: We shall auenge vs vpon them. Brother said Constans, lette vs doo one thynge, that I shall tell you, whiche is easye for to doo, that ye shall calle the one of treason: and I the other, sayinge that theyr father slewe our father by treason. And also we shall proue that their father wroughte treason ayenst the king Charlemayn, brother sayde Rohars, ye speake well, but we must suffre a while till we see howe they shal bere themself in court, for &amp; they doo any otherwyse than they oughte to doo: We shal mowe kylle them and be not blamed for it. After this doon: ye oughte to knowe that the children of Reinawde of Mountawban, bare themselfe full honestlye in courte, for all the barons loued them dere, saue only the two sonnes of Foulques of moryllon, wherof Aimonet and yon∣net perceyued it ryght well, and spa∣ke not with them, nor haunted theim not. It was greate meruayll of the great giftes y<SUP>t</SUP> the sōnes of Reynawd gaue to the Barons and gentilmen of the court of Charlemain, as were fayre horses and harnays and many clothes of sylke of dyuers coloures, and in lyke wise they gaue to the la∣dyes and gentil women fayre gounes of clothe of golde and of syluer. And of the other parte they kepte a great estate and good house to al poore gen∣tylmen and squiets, and dyd so much good that they were greately praised of euerye manne. What shoulde I telle you more? the childrene of Rey∣nawde dyd so muche in the courte of the king Charlemayne: that of all the worlde they were loued, and prin∣cypallye of the kinge Charlemayne. whan the kinge sawe that they be∣haued theim so well and so wisely in his court: he was ryght glad of it so loued he theym moste of anye yonge knyght of his courte, and made them his keruers a fore hym. And thenne whan the two sonnes of Foulques of Moryllon sawe that the kynge loued theim so muche: they were full angrye, in so muche that they wexed mad all quicke for angre of it, and so swate by greate angre that they should slea thē, or euer theishould goe to
<PB N="clx" REF="165"/> from the courte. It happed so that vpon whyt sonday euyn as the kyng was at Parys, and wolde keep opē courte, and there was Aymonet and yonnet with the other barons in the halle. This hanging: aryued there a knyghte of Almayne that presented to the kynge a fayre knyfe after the facyon of the londe, then called the king yonnet &amp; gaue it him by greate loue. And whan yonner had receiued this gyft of the kyng &amp; as he shoulde haue gone to his place agayn: he sho∣ued Constans with his elbowe a∣yenst his wil. And whan Constans saw that yonnet had doon so: he had greate dispite at it, and saide. What is this? must there be so muche set by these two boies the sonnes of a trai∣tour, whiche been not worth a roten apple? &amp; this one is all redye become so proude that he hathe nowe shoued me with his elbowe by great enuye and pride, muche other langage con∣stans saide by Yonnet: Whiche he ought not for to saye, and whan yon∣net hearde that Constans had called him the sonne of traytour: he was so∣re an angred. So came he to him and saide Constans ye haue learned a foule craft, that is that ye can speake shrewdely withoute a cause lawfull why, for I haue hearde that ye haue called me and my brother the sonnes of a traitour, &amp; that the kinge know∣eth well that our father slewe yours by treason, wherof I will ye wyt that ye lie falsely, but your father did assail oures by treason as a traitour, come of the lignage of traitoures. But God wolde not that my father shoulde dye so, nor myne vncles. my father slew your father, it is true, but it was in his defendynge of hys body, &amp; he did then as a noble knight, as he is, and if ye be so hardy that ye wil maintein that he did it by treasō: heere I cast now my gage afore thys noble companye, saying that ye haue lied falsely, saue the reuerence of the kinge Charlemayne, and of his fe∣lawshyp.</P>
<P>THan whan the kynge Charle∣mayne sawe that none of the barons said nothyng of the stryfe of yonnet and of Constans: he was an∣gry for it, and sayde. Constans ye doo greate wronge for to saye that I and the twelue peeres of fraunce know well that Reinawde of Mountaw∣ban slewe your father by treason, hol∣de your peace said Charlemayne, for yf ye knew well how the matter is ye shaulde not speake of it, wherfore I commaund you in as much as ye fea∣re to angre me: that ye make amēdes to yonnet of that ye haue said, or elles voide incontinent my courte and my realme, for ye haue troubled all my courte, wherof I am not contente. And whan Rohars hearde this that the kinge Charlemayne had sayde to Constans his brother: he was angry and so rose on his feete, and said. Sir I am redy to proue vpon Aimonet y<SUP>t</SUP> his father slew our father by treason and heere is my gage. Rohars saide Charlemain, heere ye take a wronge waie, and it shall be to you ouer late, whan ye shal repent it. Whan Aymo¦net and yonnet vnderstoode these wordes: thei kneeled afore the kynge Charlemayne and saide to him. Syr
<PB REF="166"/> for god we praye you ryght humblye that ye take the gages y<SUP>t</SUP> Rohars hathe caste, for with goddes grace we shal wel defend our father of the trai¦son, that they put vpon him. Childrē saide the king, sith it please you that I take them: I shall doo so, and than the king Charlemayn tooke the ga∣ges, &amp; Constans auaunced himself &amp; saide. Syr we vnderstonde that we shall fyghte two and two, the one a∣yenst the other. ¶ whan the kynge Charlemayne had take the gages of bataile of Constans and of Rohars: he asked theym who shoulde be theyr suretes, than lept forth the traytoure Guanellon, betenger, Escouf of mo∣ryllon, Lyon of pygnabel &amp; Gryffon of hautbraunche, the whiche said to king Charlemayne, syr we will be suretes for Constans &amp; Rohars, for they be of our lygnage. Lordes saide Charlemain I take them you to kee∣pe, and I charge you to bryng them againe to the court whan time shal∣be. Syr sayd the sureties we shal doo as ye commaund vs. And whan the king had receiued the sureties of Cō∣stans and of Rohars: Aymonet and yonnet came forth, &amp; said in this ma∣ner. Sir heere been our gages howe that we wil defende that oure father slew neuer Foulques of morillon by treasō. Children said the king Char∣lemaine ye speake well, but I must haue surety of you as I haue of the o∣ther party, yf I wil doo reason, than lept forth Rowland Olyuer, the du∣ke Naimes of bauyre, Ogier of den∣marke, Richarde of Normandy, and Escoufe the sonne of Oedon, which said to the kyng. Syr we been sure∣ties for the sonnes of Reinawd, &amp; we shall present theim to you at the daye of bataill. Sirs saide the king Char∣lemayne it pleaseth me wel, but the chyldren of Reynawde been not yet knightes as ye know, but by the fai∣the that I owe to god they shall be to morowe, and than we shal sende our letters to Reynawde that he come to see the battayl of his childrē, for thys daie fourty dayes I deuyse it. Whan the euyn came: the kyng Charlemain made be called hys stuarde and sayde to hym. Goe and bryng me to morow the sonnes of Reynawde, for I wyll that they ben to morow named knigh¦tes, and see that they been well ho∣noured, for I wyll doo this for the lo∣ue of theyr father, and puruey so that they haue eche of theim a good cour∣ser and good harnays mete for their bodyes. Whan the stuarde hearde the commaundement of the king Char∣lemayne: he dyd well the tenour ther∣of. And whan the morning came: the stuarde brought Aimonet, &amp; yonnet, well apoynted, and in theyr compa∣nye all suche other as the kynge for their loue wolde make knightes that daye. And whan that they were afore the kinge: Aymonet and Yonnet re∣quyred the ordre of knyghthode, to whome the kinge gaue it with good hearte, and in lyke wise the other for loue of them, and than was a greate feast made that daye. And whan the feast was finished: Charlemain too∣ke a messager, whiche he sente vnto Reinawd of Mountawban, and sent him worde that he should come to the court with good companye, for hys chylderne were called of treason, by
<PB N="clxi" REF="166"/> the sonnes of Foulques of Morillon sayinge that he had slayne theyr fa∣ther by treason, and how hys childrē had caste their gages, sayinge that they had lyed falsely.</P>
<P>THan whan the duke Reinaw∣de hearde these tydynges that Charlemayne sent hym: he meruay∣led of it sore. Than sent he for all his bretherne by his letters y<SUP>t</SUP> he shoulde com to him in armes, for it was nee∣de. And whan the bretherne of Rey∣nawde vnderstoode these tydynges: without anye taryinge they came to the brother at Mountawban. And whan Reinawde sawe them: he was glad and kyssed them thone after the other, and after he tolde them al that the king Charlemayne had giue him to knowe, and whan the brethern of Reynawde vnderstoode it: they mer∣uaylled of it, brother saide Rycharde doubte not, for the mater shall come better than ye weene of, by the grace of god. I counseyll that we goe to the court of the kyng Charlemayne. For whan we shall be there we shal soone vnderstonde the kinges mynde, and what his will is towarde you, and I promise you, yf he hathe doone anye wronge to our neuewes your childrē god neuer haue mercye on my soule, but I shal slee him, what hap therof Brother saide Reinawde I wyl wel that we goe to Paris, and whan we shal be there, we shal wel vnderstond how the kinge Charlemaine bereth himselfe toward my chyldren. Bro∣ther sayd Alard, ye speake well &amp; wi∣selye, &amp; me semeth after myne aduise that we ought to goe thither without anye longe taryinge. And whan they were there to accorded: they departed fro Moūtawban with a right noble company, and so muche they rode by their Iourneys that they came to the citie of parys. And whan they were come there: al the .xii. peeres knew a∣non of their coming, and went ayenst them, and brought with them Aymo∣net &amp; yonnet, and receyued Reinawd &amp; his bretherne with great ioye &amp; ho∣nour. And whan Reynawd saw his two fayre sonnes: he said to them in this wise. My children now shal it be seen if ye be my sonnes or no. For and ye be my chylderne, ye shall auenge me of that great shame that these trai¦toures put vpon me without a cause. Father said the chyldren: doubte not therof, for &amp; they were .x. ayenst vs, yet shall we ouercome theym by the grace of god. For euerye man know∣eth well that ye be as true a knyghte as any is in the worlde. And whan the kynge Charlemaine knewe the comyng of Reinawd that was come so well accompanyed: he was gladde of it, and sent worde to Reynawde that he should come to him, the which thynge Reynawde dyd, and whan the kyng saw him he made him good chere and with good hearte, and also to his brethern. And whan Reinaw∣de had be with the king a longe whi∣le: he tooke leue of him &amp; went to his lodges again, and whā he was there he callede his bretherne and his chil∣dren &amp; said to them. My sonnes come hither, tell me how the kynge Char∣mayn bereth himselfe towarde you, &amp; what he sayth of this quarell that ye haue vndertake. I muste knowe
<PB REF="167"/> the trouth of it. Father sayd the chyl∣dren, wyt it that the kynge Charle∣mayne loueth vs muche, and he en∣treteyneth vs aboue all other honou∣rably, for the loue of you that he lo∣ueth ryghte much, as he sayth. And than they tolde him how he had ma∣de them knightes, and how he sustei∣ned their quarell ayenst the traytou∣res, and all other.</P>
<P>WHan Reinawde and his brethern heard the childrē speake thus: they were glad of it, for they doubted lest Char∣lemaine wolde haue faten euell with them. And whan Reynawd of moū∣tawban wist that the king had borne hymselfe so wel toward his sonnes: he saide that he shoulde serue hym e∣uermore as his souerayne lorde. And on the morowe Reinawde went for to see the king at his risyng from his bed and thanked him muche of the greate worshyp that he had doone to his chyldren. Than said Charlemai∣ne to him. Reinawde euer syth that I sawe that ye dyd my commaunde∣mente with good wil, &amp; that ye were obeynge to me: I dyd caste all myne angre from me, and all the euyll wyll that I had ayenst you, and I wil that ye wit that I am wel yours, and shal be as longe as I lyue in this worlde, for I take you for one of my best freendes. And whan Reinawd heard y<SUP>e</SUP> debonairtie and the kinde wordes of the king: he cast himself to the feet of him, and in lykewise dyd all hys bretherne, and thanked him muche, &amp; wyt that Reinawd &amp; his bretherne abode in parys with greate Ioye and pleasure vnto the daye of the batayll that shoulde be of his childerne. And this hangyng: Reynawde had doon make good harnays for his chyldren and had pourueyed two good horses for them.</P>
<P>THan whan the day of the ba∣tayll was come: the chyldren of Foulques of Moryllon came and presented them afore the kynge redy for to fyght. And whan the kyng saw them: he saide to theim. Childrene ye haue had euyll counseyll to chalenge the sonnes of Reynawde of Moun∣tawb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, as ye haue doon. For I am sure, it shall repent you, but this is not the first faut that your lygnage hath doon, nor it shall not be the last. I feare me of it. And whan the earle Guanellon &amp; al they of y<SUP>e</SUP> lygnage of Foulques of morillon heard the king speake so: they were so greatlye abas∣shed, y<SUP>t</SUP> thei wist not what thei should doo, but kept al their peace, &amp; aswe∣red no word. And than said Constās to the king. Syr we pray you for god that ye wyll telle to vs the place where we shall fight ayenst our ene∣mies. Than stood vp the duke Nay∣mes of bauyere, &amp; said, syr Constans speaketh well, ye must deuise the pla∣ce, and where they shall fyght two a∣yenst .ii. or one ayenst a nother alone. Naymes sayde the kyng, I wyl that ye Iudge this matter, sir sith that it please you so: I shal bespeake it with a good will. Syr said the duke Nay∣mes, me semeth, bycause that Con∣stans hath called the sonnes of Rey∣nawd to batayl both for one mater: that they ought to fight two ayenst
<PB N="clxii" REF="167"/> nawde to battayl both for one matter that they ought to fyght two ayenst two, and al foure togyther. Syr sayd Reynawde, the duke Naymes sayth ryght well. By my fayth Reinawde sayde the kinge Charlemayne, and I graunt it so, but I wyll that the ba∣taylle be made in the ysle of our ladye within sauoine to morow in the mor∣nynge. And whan the kynge Char∣lemayne had sayde thus: the barons tooke leue of him, &amp; eche of thē went to their lodges, and Reinawde also the which tooke his two sonnes with him, and the two sōnes of Foulques of Moryllon went also with theyr freendes. Whan Reinawde and his bretherne had souped, and had made good there: he made brynge harneis ynoughe, and made Alarde and Ry∣charde, and hys two chyldren aymo∣net, and yonnet, to be armed. And thā he made to be shewed to Aymonet and to yonnet howe they shoulde de∣fende themself of their enemies, and in what maner they shoulde assaylle them. And whā that this was doon: Reynawde dyd sende hys chyldren to sainte Vyctoure and the traytoures went to saynt Germayne for to wat∣che that nyghte. And whan the daye came: a byshop that was of the lyg∣nage of Constans and of rohars san∣ge masse afore his cosins, &amp; the bys∣shoppe Turpyn said masse affore the sonnes of Reinawd, which was with them at saint Victoure, and also the tuelue peeres of Fraunce. And whan the yonge knightes had hearde the masse: they came al in their harnays to the palays before the kynge Char∣lemayne. And whan the kynge sawe them: he called his neuew Rowland and Olyuer, the duke Naimes of ba∣uyete, and Richarde of Normandye, and sayde to them. Lordes ye ben all my menne. I commaunde you vpon the trouthe that ye owe to me, that ye goe keep the feeld by such maner that my honoure be saued by it, and that ye keep to euery man his ryghte. For by the fayth that I owe to god, yf the¦re be any man so hardy that wyll doo any outrage: I shall angre hym right sore. Wherfore I wyll that ye passe the water of Sayne, in to the ylle wyth the fyghters and that ye beare wyth you the halowes, for to make theym swete there vpon, a fore they shall entre in to the feelde, that they goe to it all in good quarell truly. Sir saide the barons, we shall doo youre commaundemente, and also we shall keep therin well your honour, for we ben bounde therto. Lordes sayde the kynge Charlemayne, ye speake wel, but ye must take good heede well to all. For there shall be great folke ga∣thered of the one parte, &amp; of the other, wherfore I feare me that some med∣lynge shall happe amonge them. For Rohars is full of greate treason, and all his freendes I know it well. And of the other parte. Reynawde &amp; hys bretherne are ryghte puyssaunte and wise, and thei haue great power with them, and they wyl not see themselfe wronged, and namely Rycharde the brother of Reinawd, for &amp; if he be ons angrye: he spareth nother kynge nor erle. And therfore I feare him most of all the other, for he wolde once haue slayne me, I am yet remembred ther∣of. Of Reynawde I doubte not for
<PB REF="168"/> he is in euery thyng reasonable. Sir saide the duke Naymes be not dys∣mayed of nothyng, for we shall keep well youre ryght and your honoure without to doo any wronge to any body. This hanging: the children of Foulques of Moryllon went to the said ysle, where as the king Charle∣main had told them that they should fight. And whan they were passed o∣uer the riuer in to the ysle with their horses: they bounde theim and than they set theim selfe downe vpon the faire grasse, waytinge after theyr aduerse partie. Now heare what the traitoures had ordeyned, ye ought to wyt that whyle the kynge Charle∣maine had spoken with his Barons as ye haue heard: Berenger, Ardock and Griffon of haute braunche dyd put themselfe in a bushe, nygh by the saide ysle of oure lady, and purposed that yf the sonnes of Reynawde had the better of the feelde ayenst the two other sonnes of Morillon: that than they shoulde yssue oute vpon theym, with a right great numbre of folke, for to slea them shamefully.</P>
<P>WHan that Reinawd saw that it was time that hys sonnes shoulde goe to the ysle for to accomplysh their battaille: he called Aymonet, &amp; said to him, com hither faire sonne ye be the eldest, and therfore ye ought to be honoured afo∣re the yonger brother, holde I gyue you flamberge my good swerde, by the whiche ye shall take vengeaunce of these traytours. For ye been in the righte, and they in the wrong, father said Aymonet, ye may be in a suretie that ye shal see this day suche a thing that shal be to youre hertes ioye, for we shall bring the traitours to their shamefull death, &amp; it please god. And whan Reinawd heard hys sonne so valiauntly speake: he was glad, and kissed him. And than he gaue hym his benediccion, and in lykewise to yonnet. And whan he had doon this: he broughte his bretherne &amp; his chil∣dren to the ysle of our lady. And whā they were ouer: he and his bretherne came again towarde the kynge. But as they wolde haue gone: there came a messengat that ascried to Reinaw∣de as loude as he might. Reynawde haue mercy on thy children. For yf thou see not wel to them: they be lost. wyt that Griffon of haute braunche is embusshed with a greate numbre of folke by the ille for to slea thy chil∣dren. And whan Reynawde vnder∣stoode these wordes: he blustred red in his face all for angre, and sayde. Ha sweet fraunce, that it is great do∣mage that ye may neuer be withoute traytoures. And whan he said this: he called his brother Richarde, and said to him. Faire brother goe wyth∣out tarying, and arme your selfe, and doo arme al our folke, and than bring theym to the ysle and if the false trai∣toure Griffon of hautbraunche come for to greue my childerne: slea hym incontinence. And whan ye be there: doo that ye maye be seen of both par∣tyes. And for God keepe well yf the sōnes of Foulques of morillon haue the better: that ye help not in no wise my childerne, but let theym dye if it come so. For it were greate dysho∣noure for vs: yf ye dyd otherwise,
<PB N="cxliii" REF="168"/> Brother sayd Richarde, let me alone therof, our worship shal be saued by the grace of god. For I wolde not helpe yf it came so for al the good of the worlde. For all oure lyfe dayes we should be rebuked of it, &amp; all oure lygnage also. And whan Richarde had sayd so: he departed fro his bre∣thern, and went and armed hym and all his folke, and then they lyghted on horsebacke, &amp; went anon there as Reynawd had sayd. This hanging: went Reynawde to the kinge in hys palays, and when the kynge sawe him, he sayde to him Reynawd ye be ryght welcome. Syr sayde Reinaw∣de, god encrease youre honoure, and whan Charlemayne sawe not Ri∣charde with his bretherne: he tooke some susspecion of him and sayde to Reynawde. Where is youre brother Rycharde that he is not heere with thother. Sir sayd Reinawde he is gone there as I haue sent him but take no susspeccion at al for him: no∣more I doo said Charlemayn as lō∣ge as ye be a liue, but we must goe vpon the towre of saine for to see the bataille of youre children, let vs goe there, sir said reinawd whan it plea∣se you, than went they vpon the tou∣re, &amp; with theim the byshop Turpyn salamon of breten, Ogier the dane, Guidellon of bauyere and manye o∣ther barons.</P>
<P>THus as the kynge Charle∣mayne was gon vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> tou∣re for to see the battayll: he looked &amp; sawe come the brother of reynawd, and a great company of men armed. And whan Charlemayn saw him: he knewe hym well, for he bare hys owne cote of armes, and Rycharde had doon so for bycause he should be knowen. And whan Charlemayne saw this: he was all abasshed of it, and thenne he called Reynawde and sayde to hym. What wyl ye doo Rey∣nawde, wyll ye dyshonour me? haue ye forgoten all redy youre trouthe? Syr sayde Reynawd nay, saue your reuerence, but I wyll serue you and worshyp you as my souerayn lorde. why said the kynge Charlemayne, is Richarde gon in to the ysle of our lady with so great felawship for to breake the feelde of the which thin∣ge. I shal be dyshonoured? Sir sayd reynawde haue no doubte therof, for I take god to suretye and waraunte that knoweth all thynges that ry∣charde shall doo nothynge that shal turne to your dyshonour ne to no do∣mage to you, and I shal tell you why my brother rycharde hathe put hym∣selfe in armes, ye must wyt that the traytoure Gryffon of hautbraunche is enb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shed vnder Saynte Marcell in a gardyn with a greate numbre of folke armed, that wyll breake your feelde for to slea my chylderne. And therfore hath my brother armed him for to succoure them if neede be, and yf ye see that rychard doo any thing againste youre wyll and comaunde∣ment: heere I am, that vpon me take the vengeaunce. is It trouthe sayde Charlemayne, that Gryffon hathe doon so as ye saye? yea said reynawd verely, for I wolde not tell you none otherwise. Right angry was Char∣lemayne whan he hearde that Rei∣nawde had tolde him. Than he swa∣re god and all his sayntes, that if he
<PB REF="169"/> might take Griffon of hautbraunch: that he should make hym be hanged, and all his folke with him. He cal∣led than Salamon, and the earle of poiters and Guidellon of bauiere, &amp; faid to them. Lordes make me anon a thousande knyghtes to be armed. For I wil go in to y<SUP>e</SUP> ysle for to see the pride of these traitours. And I swere you by saint Iames, yf I may they shall doo me no more dyshonour and yf I cane fynde theym: they shal aby it ful deerely. Syr sayde Reynawde ye speake lyke a kynge. The barons than dyd that Charlemayne had sent in to the ysle sawe rycharde with his folke in armes. And whan rowland sawe that they weare armes: he was not well contente with it, and sayde to the other Barons that were come wyth hym for to keepe the feelde. what wyl Rychard doo? blame haue the kinge Charlemayne yf he take not vengeaunce vpon Reynawde of that they haue doon ayenst his cō∣maundemēt, by my faith said Oliuer and the duke Naymes ye saye well. Than sayd Ogyer, lordes I promy∣se you that Reynawde knoweth no∣thynge of that, that rycharde dooth. Thus as the peeres of fraunce were spekynge of that: rychard was come in to the feelde in armed Gryffon ys∣sued oute of his bushement with his folke, bicause he was aferde that ri∣charde wolde greue the chyldren of Foulques of Moryllon. And whan rowlande sawe hym: he cryed to him with a hie voice. By god traytoure this shal nought auayl you for afore that anye stroke be gyuen of theym: they shall make theyr othe, and ye shall abye it full derelye that ye haue doon. Ryght sorye was Rowlande whan he saw the foule treason that Griffon wolde haue brought about. This hanging: came there Charle∣mayne wyth a great company of fol∣ke well armed. And whan he sawe Rowland: he sayd to hym. Neuewe whye doo ye suffre the outerage that the sonnes of Foulques of Morillon wolde doo to the chyldrē of Reinaw∣de, of mountawban. I blamed Rey∣nawd, bicause his brother had armed him: but I know now wel that they had reason, sir said Rowlande none cā beware of traitours. Neuew said Charlemane ye saye trouthe: but by the fayth that I owe to god. I shall make theym all to be hanged in dys∣pyte of all theyr lygnage onely for y<SUP>e</SUP> treasō that thei haue doon this day. By god syr sayde Rowland ye shall doo well. And than came there Rey∣nawd vpon a palfrai without swerd And whan Rowlande sawe hym: he saide vnto him. Syr Reinawde is it youte will that Richarde youre bro∣ther is com hither in armes? sir row¦lande sayd Reynawd, yea verely, for nothing that I haue doon shal not be hydde from you, ye haue now seen y<SUP>e</SUP> treasō that the traitours wold haue wrought ayenst my children, &amp; there∣fore whan I knew their falshode: I commaunded my brother Richard y<SUP>t</SUP> he should put himselfe shortly in ar∣mes w<SUP>t</SUP> my men for to succour them y<SUP>t</SUP> the traytoures came them vpon, &amp; yf ye thinke y<SUP>t</SUP> richarde or I haue doon amys in any thinge: so let the kyng make Iustice of it. By my soule said Rowlande, nother you nother youre
<PB N="Clxiiii" REF="169"/> brother be not to be blamed, but ye haue doone as good knight{is} should doo. And I promise you that youre enemies shalbe this day brought to shame and confusion.</P>
<P>ANd whan Rycharde of moū∣tawban sawe Charlemayn: he knew well that he was come for to keepe the feeld, and that the tray∣tours should not con doo any thing to his neuews. So said he to his fol¦ke let vs take of our harneys. For syth that the kyng is heere himself: we need not to wayte heere no more. Than went Richarde and his folke and dysarmed them. And whan Ri∣charde had doone so: he lyght agayn vpon his horse, and came agayne o∣uer the ryuer of Saynt swyminge vnto the foresayd ysle. And whan he was on lande: he spurred his horse, and made him to lepe three or foure lepes afore the company. And than he came streyght afore the kyng, and made to him reuerens honourably. whan the kinge sawe Rycharde: he sayd to hym, and ye Rycharde wyll ye dyshonour me, that are come in arme for to breke my feeld? Syr said Rycharde saue your grace, for I ne∣uer thought it, but wyt it well for certayne, that yf Gryffron of haut¦braūche had come for to greue mine neues: I wolde haue made his for∣head for to swete. Syr ye be our so∣uerayne lorde, so ought ye to mayn∣ten and keepe vs, and so shall I tell you a thing afore al your barons, y<SUP>t</SUP> yf ye beleue the traytours of Maūt: ye shall ones repent it. I am well a payed that ye &amp; your .xii. peres haue seen the treason of Griffon of haut-braunche, how he wolde haue slayne mine neuews. Ha by god said char∣lemayne, ye saye trouth, he is well worthy to be blamed, and I tell you they that shalbe ouer come shalbe hā¦ged, nor shall not be saued for none of theyr lynage. Syr sayd Rycharde it pleaseth me well, but I tell you y<SUP>t</SUP> yf I should dye: I should neuer suf∣fre my neuews to be wronged. By my head sayd the kynge, ye shall see that I shal doo reason vnto euerye party. For I shall bryng th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m toge∣ther, let god helpe the ryght. Than whan Charlemayne had sayde so: he went to the two children of Foul∣ques of Moryllon, and sayd to them now lordes hye you of that ye haue to doo, goe and swere vpon the ha∣lowes y<SUP>t</SUP> iustly ye entre in this qua∣rell. Syr sayd they we shall doo it w<SUP>t</SUP> ryght good wyll, for the chyldren of Reynawde ben dead, but yf that they confesse, that theyr father slew our father by treason. Then spake y<SUP>e</SUP> bisshop Turpin, and sayd, Lordes come hither, and swere vpon the ha∣lowes, &amp; see to that ye forswere not yourself, for he that forswereth him selfe shalbe ouer throwen, no doubte therof, whan the bisshop Turpin had said this: the two sonnes of foul¦ques of moryllon kneeled downe a∣fore the halowes, and sware that rei¦nawde of Mountawban had slayne theyr father by treason, &amp; after they had made theyr othe: they kyssed the Halowes, and offred two besans of golde. And than went and lyghted vpon theyr horses. And th{us} as they lyghted: they were to nye eche other
<PB REF="170"/> so that thone hurted thother so hard: that they fel downe almoste both to the erth. And whan Reynawde saw this: he sayd to y<SUP>e</SUP> other barons heere is an euyll token. I beleue that they ben forsworne. This hanging: cam the children of Reinawde, that knee∣led afore the halowes and swore y<SUP>t</SUP> the two sonnes of Foulques of Mo¦ryllon had lied falsely all that they had sayd. And then they put their hā¦des vpon the halowes, and offred a ryche gifte, and y<SUP>e</SUP> Bysshop Turpyn gaue them the benediction, &amp; in lyke¦wyse the kynge Charlemayne, and all the other barons, &amp; than of Rey∣nawde, and of his brethern and after they wente and moūted vpon their horses lightly.</P>
<P>WHan the foure Champions were vpon theyr horses: thei made none other taryenge: but gaue the spurres to theyr horses, and ran one against an other and smote eche other in theyr sheeldes so sore: y<SUP>t</SUP> the speres flew in peeces without y<SUP>t</SUP> any of them fell on the ground. And whā they had broken their speres: thei set hande vnto their swerdes. Than Aymonet that helde Flamberge in hys hande sayde vnto Yonnet hys brother. I pray you brother thynke to doo well. For if ye helpe me, they shalbe vtterly shamed and discomfi∣ted as traytours as they ben. Bro∣ther sayd Yonnet doubt not, for I shall neuer fayle you to the death, &amp; also we ought to recomfort vs. For we ben in the ryght, and they be in y<SUP>e</SUP> wronge. Whan the two brethern had spoke ynoughe: they went bothe at ones vpon theyr enemyes, wyth theyr swerdes in theyr handes. And than Aymonet ouertooke Constans with flamberge his swerd, and gaue him suche a stroke that the swerde slyded vpon the viser, and kut it and his nose a sunder. And whan Aymo∣net sawe that the nose of his enemie fall to the erth: he mocked him &amp; said to him. By god Constans it is wor∣se with you than it was afore, for ye shall neuer ben without a mocke, for that, that this stroke hath doone vn¦to you, for Flamberge slew your fa∣ther, and so shal it doo you &amp; it please god. And whan Rohars sawe that his brother was so sore wounded: he ranne vpon Yonnet and gaue hym so mighty a stroke vpon hys helme: so that yf it had not ben of good fine steele: he had slaine hī without fayle. This hangyng: Aymonet ranne a∣gayne vpon Constans and gaue hī suche a stroke vpon hys helme, that he made him for to bowe hys backe vpon the sadle, &amp; for the great might of the stroke: the horse muste for veri need fall down vpon his knees, and smote his mussell into the erth. And whan that the horse felt that stroke: he rose lightly vp agayne all afray∣ed, and began for to runne thoro∣ghe y<SUP>e</SUP> medowes maugre of his mai∣ster as mad, nor Constans had not the myghte for to rule hym: bycause he was a mased and a stonied of that stroke, that he had receyued. And than Aymonet and Yonnet wente bothe vpon Rohars, and beganne to fare foule with him, and whan Rohars sawe hymself so sharpelye
<PB N="clxv" REF="170"/> handled: he began to crye with a hie voyce. Brother where be you, shall ye ler me thus to be slayne falsly? Cō¦stans that ranne throughe the me∣dow was comen agayne to himself and apeased his horse a litle heard his brother crye. So came he agayn to hym: and smote Aymonet vpon his helme a great stroke, but the hel∣me was good, and dommaged hym not. And whan that Constans sawe that he had not slayne Aymonet w<SUP>t</SUP> his stroke: he wend to haue gone out of his wit, &amp; of y<SUP>e</SUP> other part: he saw the place that was al couered with y<SUP>e</SUP> bloud of his brother, so wyst not cō∣stans what to doo. For Aymonet gaue hym so muche to doo.</P>
<P>THys hanging: Yonnet tooke Rohars bi the helme, &amp; wolde haue strāgled him by fyne force. But whan Constans saw that: he spur∣red hys horse with the spurres, and shoued him betwene Rohars &amp; Yon∣net, so that it was force to yonnet to let goe hys prise wolde he or no. And whan Aymonet saw that Constās had deliuered Rohars from the hā∣des of yonnet: he went &amp; rāne vpon Constans and smote him with flam∣berge vpon the sheelde so harde that he made of it two peeces. Shortlye to speake: the chyldren of Reynawde hasted so muche the two sonnes of Foulques that they began to lese place, &amp; were so werye, that they as∣ked none other thyng: but for to rest themselfe. But Aymonet &amp; yonnet had none other wyll: but for to fight still, &amp; I tell you for certayne y<SUP>t</SUP> they were all foure sore wounded y<SUP>t</SUP> they lost much bloud for they had fought longe. And whan Constans had so∣iourned a litle: he came vpon Aymo∣net and gaue him suche a stroke: so that he made him a great wounde, but no dead wounde. And whā Ay∣monet saw him so wounded: he gaue Constans so great a stroke vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> eare: that he bare it away withal the iawe bone, whan charlemayne saw that great stroke: he might not for∣beare, but he said. By god now is he worse arayed thā he was before, for the two sonnes of Foulques of mo∣rillon bē shamed and confused. Sir sayd Reynawde they haue well deser¦ued it, for they haue forsworne thē selfe falsly. This hanging: Yonnet went vpon Rohars, and gaue him so great a stroke vpon hys helme: y<SUP>t</SUP> he brake it, and made his swerde to entre in his head a finger deep. Wyt it that the batayle lasted longe the one agaynst the other, and it happed y<SUP>t</SUP> by force of fighting, y<SUP>e</SUP> one against the other: they were fyghtyng two &amp; two together, wel a bowe shot from eche other, and so made they two batayles, for aymonet fought agaīst Constans, &amp; yonnet faught agaynst Rohars, which was fore greued, for Yonnet had brought hym to the erth And whan yonnet sawe that he had brought downe rohars: he sayd that it were shame to fyght with hym on horsbacke agaynst him on foote, so lighted he downe for to fyght wyth Rohars. But whā he had habādon∣ned his horse: In contynent the said horse ran to y<SUP>e</SUP> horse of Rohars and wolde haue strāgled him. And whā Charlemayne saw that: he began to
<PB REF="171"/> laughe with it and sayd, by my fay∣th we haue three batayles. But I se well that Yonnet hath brought Ro∣hars so lowe that he may no more. whan Rohars saw that he myght no more endure the great strokes of Yonnet: he began to crye and sayde Ha fayre brother Constans, where are ye y<SUP>t</SUP> ye come not &amp; helpe me y<SUP>t</SUP> are so good a knight, and that toke first the quarell in hande, wherof it goeth full euyll with vs. For yf ye succour me not now: I shall dye incontinent And whan Constans heard his bro¦ther crye thus: he left Aymonet, and went towarde Yonnet, for to helpe hys brother, but wyt it well that he went not very sounde from Aymo∣net, for he had made hym moe than xx. woundes. And whan Constans was come to hys brother: Inconty∣nent he ranne vpon Yonnet wyth his horse. And whan Aymonet saw that: he began to crie after Constās and sayd. By my soule he baptysed you full yl y<SUP>e</SUP> named you Constans. For I saw neuer more towarde thā ye be that so renneth away for feare of me, &amp; whan he had sayd so: he ran after for to succour hys brother yon¦net. And whan he was come there: he went a fresshe vpon Constans, &amp; Constans vpon hym, y<SUP>e</SUP> which gaue him a great stroke vpon his helme but the stroke slyded vpon the horse and slew hym withall. And whan Aymonet haw him a groūd: he righ∣ted hym quickely &amp; smote Constans vpon his helme and it was so harde that flamberge coulde not entre in it &amp; the stroke slyded vpon the vyser &amp; brast it, and a great part of his vi∣sage, so that the teeth were seen plai¦nely, and with y<SUP>t</SUP> fel y<SUP>e</SUP> stroke vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> horse necke, so that he kit it in two peeces, and so fell the horse dead to the erth.</P>
<P>SOre abasshed was Constans whan he saw his horse slain, and than Aymonet sayd to him. By god false traytour nowe shalt thou dye, ye dyd yll whan ye called euer my father of treason, whiche is as true a knyght as is anye in all the worlde, but now is the daye come y<SUP>t</SUP> ye shall abye it ful deere. And whan Reynawde heard his sonne speake thus: he was ryght glad of it, &amp; thā∣ked God therof hertlye, &amp; whan Ay∣monet saw Constans vpon his feet agayne: he went him vpon, and ha∣sted hym ryght sore with strokes so y<SUP>t</SUP> Constans had no power to strike one stroke more, but he went abacke heere and there for to eschew y<SUP>e</SUP> stro∣kes of Aymonet. And whan Con∣stance saw y<SUP>t</SUP> he wyst no more what to doo: he cast hys sheelde to the erth, and tooke Aimonet by the waste for to wrastle with hym. And whan ay∣monet saw this he was not afearie of it, for he was stronge and lyght so tooke he Constans by the helme, and drew it towarde him w<SUP>t</SUP> such might that he pulled it from the head of him. And whan Constās saw him so sore handled: he cryed vpon his bro∣ther Rohars &amp; sayd. Ha brother suc∣cour me, for I haue no power for to defende my selfe. Whan Rohars heard his brother call thus: he was ful sory y<SUP>t</SUP> he might not help him for he had lost so much bloud y<SUP>t</SUP> he might
<PB N="Clvi" REF="171"/> not well stand vpon his feete but al∣wayes he forced himselfe so muche that he came vnto his brother Con∣stans, and wende to haue smittē Ay∣monet from behynde, but he dyd not bycause Aymonet saw hym come, &amp; went and smote hym suche a stroke that he felled hym to the earth. And than went agayne vpon Constans, and gaue him suche a stroke that he smote almoste his left arme of.</P>
<P>Than began Constans to crye and sayd. Ha fayre brother succour me: or els I am dead. Brother sayde Ro∣hars I can gyue you nother succou∣res nor helpe, for I am my self nere gone, and whan Charlemayn saw this: he sayd, by god now are dead y<SUP>e</SUP> sonnes of Foulques or morillon by theyr false wit. Syr sayd Ogier ye ought not to recke, for they mayn∣teyned a false quarell, ye say trou∣th sayd Charlemayn. Nowe theyr falshoode apereth well. Whan Rey∣nawde saw rhat his children were to their aboue: he was ryght glad of it. but so was not Guanellon, for he was so angry for it: that he became as blacke as a moore. Then called the sayd Guanellon Berenger, Ha∣rdock, Henry of Lyon and Pigna∣bell of Moryllon and sayd to them. Lordes now be we all dyshonoured, for y<SUP>e</SUP> sonnes of Foulques of Moril∣lon are discomfited, I wolde fayne succour them yf I durst but I feare to sore y<SUP>e</SUP> kynge that is there wyth great puyssaūce. Syr sayd Hardres or Hardocke, wo is me for it, but we can not doo none other thing as for this time, therfore we muste refrain our wrathe, &amp; shew a good face, to y<SUP>e</SUP> ende that no medlyng falle not vpō vs, &amp; let vs abide tyll tyme come, y<SUP>•</SUP> we may auenge vs therof.</P>
<P>THis hanging: Aimonet saw that he had smiten Constās a dead woūde: so was he ryght glad of it, by god brother ye haue doone yll y<SUP>t</SUP> ye haue slayne this false tray∣tour, for I wolde haue slayne hym wyth myne owne handes, but syth ye haue brought it so ferre: make an ende of hym at ones and I shall goe slea Rohars. Brother sayde Aymo∣net ye speake wel, now go slea the one and I the other, for thus ought men to doo wyth traytours. Thā ran the two brethern vpon theyr e∣nemies that laye on the groūd, that is to wyt vpon Constans to whom he sayd al on hye, bycause all they y<SUP>t</SUP> looked vpō should heare it. Tell me Constans false traytoure, why dyd ye call my father of treason? With∣standynge that men know wel that he is one of the truest knightes of y<SUP>e</SUP> worlde. And that he slew your father in his bodye defendynge. Where as your father had purchased for to haue slayne hym by treasō. Now tell me your falshode and confesse your treason afore the kyng, or els I shal now cut your throte. Aymonet sayd Constans, for god haue merci on me For I yeelde me to you, and than he tooke him his swerde. And whā Ay∣monet had the swerde of the said con¦stās: he tooke him vp &amp; brought him afore the kynge Charlemayne, to whome he said, Syr holde this trai∣tour &amp; doo with him as reason re∣quireth, and whan Charlemayne
<PB REF="172"/> sawe this: he was glad of it and said to Aymonet, freende ye haue doone well your deuoyr. I can no more as∣ke of you. And wit it that whan the other is vaynquisshed: I shall make theym bothe to be hanged,</P>
<P>Syr sayd Aymonet, doo your wyl wyth them. And whan he had sayde so: he went agayn to his brother Yō∣net for to helpe him holdynge his swearde in his hande all bloudy w<SUP>t</SUP> the bloud of Constans and sayd to Rohars, by God false traytour ye shal dye heere anon, and wolde haue smyten hym but Yonnet that sawe that: sayd to his brother. Fayre bro∣ther slea him not, nor touche hī, but goe your way and test your self, for I wyll conquere him by my selfe as ye haue doone yours, brother sayde Aymonet ye say yll, for it was or∣deyned that we should eche helpe o∣ther, and whan Yonnet saw that his brother wolde needes helpe agaynst his wyll: he sayde to hym. Fayre bro∣ther I make mine avowe to god, if ye touche Rohars: I shal neuer loue you, brother sayde Aymonet, ye saye not well, but I shal forbere me sith it please you so, but I promise you if I see you in daunger: I shall help you if ye should slea me, brother sayd yonnet I wyl wel, &amp; than Aymonet w<SUP>t</SUP>drew him a litle abacke, and than ranne yonnet vpon Rohars, y<SUP>t</SUP> rose vp agayne for to defende hymselfe, than gaue yonnet to hym so great a stroke vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> shoulder: that y<SUP>e</SUP> arme with y<SUP>e</SUP> shoulder bone fell clene of to the grounde and his swerde withal. whan yonnet had giuen y<SUP>t</SUP> stroke: he put his swerde agayn into y<SUP>e</SUP> sheeth &amp; sayd to Rohars, y<SUP>e</SUP> false traytour y<SUP>t</SUP> must now confesse with thine owne mouth that Reynawde my father is no traytour, but he is one of y<SUP>e</SUP> truest knightes of the worlde, and yf thou wylt not doo so: thou shalt die incō∣tinent. And whan he had sayd so: he tooke Rohars by the helme and pul∣led him to hym warde so harde y<SUP>t</SUP> he drew it fro his head, and begā for to smite him with the pomell of hys swerde vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> bare head. And whā Rohars saw y<SUP>t</SUP> he was so shrewdlye handled: he began for to crye &amp; sayd good lorde haue mercy vpō mi soule for I know well y<SUP>t</SUP> it is doone wyth my body. And whā Constans heard his brother say so: he began to weepe for he coulde none other doo. And whā yonnet sawe y<SUP>t</SUP> Rohars wolde not forsake y<SUP>t</SUP> he had sayd, nor wolde not cry him mercy: he smote him w<SUP>t</SUP> hys owne swerde so hard y<SUP>t</SUP> he tooke awaye the one legge from the bo∣dy of him. And than he put his foote vpon him and said. Now anon false traytour confesse your falshode, or els ye ben now dead, to the whiche thynge Rohars answered not. And whan yonnet saw y<SUP>t</SUP>: he smote hym the head of. Whan Aymonet sawe y<SUP>t</SUP> hys brother yonnet had slayne Ro∣hars: he was ryght glad of it, and went to hym and sayde. Brother ye haue doone valiaūtly, lorde gramer¦cy that ye haue slayne so this tray∣tour, the two brethern tooke eche o∣ther by the hande and went to char∣lemayne, to whome Aymonet sayd in thys wyse. Syr like it you y<SUP>t</SUP> wee haue doone, for we be redi for to doo muche more for you, yf ye cōmaūde
<PB N="Clxvii" REF="172"/> vs. Fayre sonnes said Charlemayn ye need not for to doo more. For ye haue doone ynoughe, for Constans is ouercomen, &amp; Rohars dead. Now go rest your self, and see that ye haue good leches for your woundes. And I promyse you that I shal doo with the traytours as it aperteineth, and than Charlemayne commaunded y<SUP>t</SUP> Constans should be hanged, and the body of his brother by him, &amp; whan the king had giuen this commaun∣dement: Constans was anon taken and the body of his brother, &amp; were drawen at horses tayles before all theyr lygnage, and than were han∣ged as they had well deserued, whā they were hāged: Charlemayne said Lordes wyt that I wolde not for a great thyng that it went otherwise. wyt it that whan Guanellon sawe hange the sonnes of Foulques that were his neuewes: he was sore an angred for it that he almost had lost hys witte. Than called he Hardres Berenger &amp; Malger that wyll more falshode than Lucifer, Henry of Li∣on, Pygnabell &amp; Geffray, men that neuer dyd good and sayde to theym. Lordes ye see howe Charlemayne hath doone to vs great dyshonour, for he hath doone hange our kinsmē shamefully, but we shall see yet the day that this shame shalbe auenged he sayd trouth y<SUP>e</SUP> traytour. For he be trayed afterwarde the .xii. Peeres of Fraunce, and made them all die at the batayle of Rounceuales.</P>
<P>AFter these thīges aboue said Reinawde of Mountawbā saw that his childrē had vainequis∣shed y<SUP>e</SUP> children of Foulques: he was right glad of it &amp; thanked much our lorde god therof, than he and his bre¦thern went to them and asked howe they dyd? father sayde the children we doo ryght well lorde gramercy. Than Alarde &amp; Guicharde behelde theyr woundes wherof they were glad. This hāging: came there char∣lemayne and the children came hym agaynst &amp; kneeled afore hī, thā char∣mayne asked them, children how is it with you be ye sore wounded? Syr sayd the children it is well with vs thanked be our lorde &amp; you: we shal soone be whole. Than the kyng sēt for al the leches &amp; sayd to them that they should looke the woundes of Aymonet &amp; of Yonnet, the whyche thyng they did w<SUP>t</SUP>out any taryeng, &amp; after they sayd to the king that they made no doubt of them &amp; that they should be soone whole. And after y<SUP>t</SUP> the Iustice was doone of the sonnes of Foulques of Morillō: Reynawde abode in Paris til his children were whole, &amp; whan they were whole: they went to the Palays to see the kynge Charlemayne, the whiche made thē good cheere &amp; gaue thē manye fayre giftes as ben castels &amp; fortresses of great name, thā Reynawde and hys brethern asked leue of the kyng, &amp; he gaue it thē against his wil, &amp; prayed them that they wolde come see him agayne, syr sayd Reynawde, we shal doo gladly your cōmaūdement. Whā Reynawde had taken leue of y<SUP>e</SUP> king and also his brethern &amp; childrē: they tooke on their way towarde moūtaw¦ban, and they did so muche by theyr Iourneys y<SUP>t</SUP> they came to bourdews
<PB REF="173"/> And whā Reynawde had rest hym a litle: he called his chrildren afore his brethern and sayd to them, my chil∣dren, heare what I wyl say to you. I ordeyne at this tyme that yonnet shal haue ardeyne for his parte and Aymonet Mountawban, for it is not longe a goe syth I heard saye y<SUP>t</SUP> god sayd, that the tree y<SUP>t</SUP> beareth frui¦te: shal neuer dye, wit it that I haue offended god greatli, and me semeth that y<SUP>e</SUP> time is now come y<SUP>t</SUP> I should amende my self. for I feare sore my poore soule, wherfore I shal doo my deuoure for to yeelde it agayne to y<SUP>e</SUP> blessed lorde y<SUP>t</SUP> made it after his I∣mage, &amp; whan his brethern hearde speake this: they know wel what he wolde doo, and therfore they began to make great sorow. And whan rei∣nawde saw that he sayd to them, for∣sothe syrs ye are not wyse to make suche sorowe, for ye knowe not yet, what I wyll doo, see ye not that I am yet with you? Wherof are yee a∣basshed? be not yee ryche ynoughe? there is nother of you but mai keep a thousand horses in his stable. Of the other part, thoughe I am nowe whole of my bodye thanked be our lorde, yet wyl I gyue in my lyfe to my children theyr part, to the ende y<SUP>t</SUP> they fall not in dyscorde after my death, and therfore I wyll that eche of you knowe from hens forthon what he shal haue. And whan Rey∣nawde had th{us} ordeyned for his chil¦dren: yonnet departed from his fa∣ther with his blessing, &amp; went to Ar∣deyne, where they of the land recey∣ued him to be their lorde and made to him fewte &amp; homage. And after y<SUP>t</SUP> Yonnet was gone: Reynawde &amp; his brethern with Aymonet wente to Mountawban, and whan they of Mountawban saw theyr lorde: thei were glad &amp; receyued hym honoura¦bly. And whan the feast was passed: Reinawde commaunded al his sub∣iectes that they should make theyr homage vnto hys sonne Aymonet, &amp; whan al this was doone, &amp; that nyght was come: euery man went to bed, &amp; than Reynawde entred hys chābre &amp; walked in it til it was mid∣nyght passed, than Reynawde vncle theo himself al naked, &amp; tooke a cote of sory russet vpon his fleshe w<SUP>t</SUP>out any shert, &amp; thervpon a great mantel of the same. And thus arayed bare∣foote &amp; w<SUP>t</SUP>out any wepyn (but onlye a staffe in his hand to defende hym from the dogges) yssued out of hys chambre, &amp; went out of the palays &amp; came to the gate of the towne, and made it to be opened, &amp; whā y<SUP>e</SUP> porter saw his lorde so yll &amp; in so poorely a∣ray &amp; barefoote: he sayd to hym. Syr alas whether goe ye thus without felawship, &amp; so yll apoynted? I wyl go awake your brethern &amp; my lorde your sonne, for ye be in great daun∣ger of theues because ye haue nother armour nor wepyn for to defende your selfe, freende sayd Reynawde let alone, go not there. For my trust is in god that he shall keep me from all daunger. But thou shalt tell my bretherne whan thou seest theym to morowe that I greete them wel, &amp; to my sonne also, and that they thynke alwayes to doo wel, &amp; y<SUP>t</SUP> they lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e eche other as thei ought for to doo, and so tel them that they shal neuer

For I go to saue my soule yf God giue me the grace to doo so, &amp; so shall I dye whan it please god, for thorough mi cause are dead many a man, wherof I feele my poore soule greued sore, &amp; therfore wyll I beare payne on my body for it, doinge penaunce all the remenaūt of my lyfe, and if I maye saue my soule: I aske none other thing. And whā Reynawde had said this: he looked on his finger &amp; tooke a ringe w<SUP>t</SUP> a precious stone, whiche was wel worth .v. mark &amp; gaue it to the porter &amp; sayd to him, my freende ye be wel rewarded of your seruice y<SUP>t</SUP> ye haue doone to me. Syr said y<SUP>e</SUP> por∣ter gramercye of this gifte, but alas syr ye put now all your countrie in great sorow for your departynge, &amp; than he began to weepe right sore.</P>
<P>This hanging: went Reynawde on hys waye thus arayed as ye haue heard, and as he went: y<SUP>e</SUP> porter loo∣ked euermore after hym by the light as longe as he might see him, &amp; whā he might no more see hī: he fel down in a swoune to the erth, and was th{us} a longe while &amp; whan he was come agayne to himselfe: he made greate mone, &amp; sith sayd. Ha God whether goth now my lorde so poorely aray∣ed? &amp; after he had made great sorow a longe whyle: he shet the gate again and went into his house. And whan he was there: he looked vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> ring that Reynawde had giuen him, and knew wel that it was a ryche gyft, wherof he was glad. ¶ We shal leue heere to speake a litle of the valyaūt Reynawde of Mountawban, y<SUP>t</SUP> goth for to saue his soule, and to doo pe∣naunce for hys synnes thoroughe the woodes lookyng downwarde: and we shall speake of his brethern, and of his sonne Aymonet.</P>

<P>IN this party sheweth the hy∣story y<SUP>t</SUP> whan Reynawde was departed from moūtawbā: he tooke his way through the woodes &amp; went a longe whyle that he eate but Ap∣ples and Medlers wilde all that day, and whan the night was come: he layde him down vnder a tree, and as he wolde slepe: he made the sygne of the crosse vpon him, and commen¦ded to our lorde and slept till it was day. And whan the day appered: Rei¦nawde rose vp &amp; went on his wayes through the wood, and wente euer more through the trauers of y<SUP>e</SUP> wood¦des well the space of .viii. dayes w<SUP>t</SUP>∣out any other meat, but wilde fruit and so longe he wente by hys iour∣neis: that he cam out of the woodes and incontinent he founde a house of religion where he abode y<SUP>t</SUP> night, the monkes woulde haue giuen him meat but he tooke nothing but bread and water. And whan the day came: he went on his way, &amp; dyd so muche day by day that he came to Coleyne vpon the rine, and whan Reynawde was come to the Citie: he founde the churche of saynt Peter a makynge, where were many masons and ma∣ni labourers that serued them. And whan he saw this: he wente into it, and kneeled before the hie aulter and made his prayers bi great deuocion And as he was thus kneelynge full busely aboute his orysons: It came sodaynlye into hys mynde that he wolde abyde there and serue the ma∣sons for y<SUP>e</SUP> honour of god &amp; of saynt Peter. And whan he had made hys prayer: he rose vp &amp; began to looke y<SUP>e</SUP> place well &amp; vpon the workemē that
<PB REF="175"/> wrought there, and sayd to hymself that it was better to serue the Ma∣sons, than to walke styll in the forest among y<SUP>e</SUP> wilde beastes. &amp; whan rey∣nawde had bethought hym wel: he went to the mayster mason and said to hym. Mayster I am a straunger and haue no gooddes of the worlde, wherof I maye lyue, if it please you I shall serue the Masons of suche thynges as them needeth for theyr werke as a poore labourer needeth, and whan the mayster mason heard Reynawde speke so: and saw he was a tall man and wel made: he answe∣red to hym sweetly in this wise. My freende ye seme not to be yssued of a poore house, for ye are more lyke a kyng than a mason or a labourer.</P>
<P>wherfore I dare not put you in wer∣ke by no wise. Notwithstanding y<SUP>t</SUP> ye be thus poorely arayed. Mayster sayd Reynawde, care ye not therfore for and it pitie you: I shal serue you truly af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er my power. My freēd said the mayster of y<SUP>e</SUP> werke, syth it please you to doo so: it pleaseth me ryght well, but I wyll not reteyne you for that prise that I doo knaues, for I shall pay you in conscience, after the werke that ye shal doo, mayster said Reynawde I am wel content. Thā the mayster mason sayd to hym, my freende goe helpe these foure that ye see there, that may not bere the sto∣ne, for they be but truaūtes, mayster layd Reynaw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, be not angry with the poore folke, for I wyll go fetche it to you anon, frend sayd y<SUP>e</SUP> mayster payne not your s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lfe therto, for it is not in your puyssaūce w<SUP>t</SUP>out ye had more helpe than thylke knaues. For the stone is of great weight, mayster let me alone sayd Reynawde I shal brynge it to you, and whan Rey∣nawde had sayd so: he cast his man∣tell fro him &amp; came to the foure men that helde the stone and sayd to them Lordes and it please you, goe fetche another stone, and I shall beare the same, freende sayde the foure men ye say well if ye can, &amp; we wyl let you doo with a good wyll. Than Rey∣nawde tooke vp y<SUP>e</SUP> stone and charged it vpon his necke, and bare it vpon the walle where it should be set, and whan the other labourers saw that: they were abashed &amp; meruayled grea¦tely of it, and begā to say the one to the other heere is wōder fro whens may thys deuyl become, we shal ne∣uer winne but a litle as longe as he is with vs heere. And whan the ma¦ster masons saw Reynawde beare so great a stone &amp; so heuy: he was glad of it. And whan Reynawde had brou¦ght the stone there as he should be set the mayster sayd to hym, freend put not downe the stone yet from you. Syr sayd Reynawd I shal wel holde it in my armes as longe as ye wyl, than the mayster made the place redi there as y<SUP>e</SUP> stone should be set, &amp; whā he was redy: he sayd to Reynawde, let go the stone my freende whan ye will, and blessed be god &amp; the houre that euer ye were borne, &amp; whan rey∣nawde had set downe the stone: the mayster cōmaūded hym y<SUP>t</SUP> he should fet hym morter, w<SUP>t</SUP> a good wyl sayde Reynawde. Than came Reynawde downe and laded of y<SUP>e</SUP> morter more thā .x. other mē should haue doone, &amp; bare it to y<SUP>e</SUP> maister mason &amp; sayd to
<PB N="clxx" REF="175"/> hym. Mayster care not for nothyng for I shall serue you wel of al thing that ye need by the grace of god, and see that ye werke as faste as ye can for I shall bringe you more stones and morter my selfe alone than yee shall con occupye; but ye haste you well. And whan the mayster Ma∣son heard Reynawde speake thus: he was merueyled and sayd. By my soule freende yf ye doo halfe that yee say: ye shall doo ynoughe. Then wēt Reynawde agayne and brought vp so many stones that he made with it a great hepe vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> walles ynough for to occupye at ones all the masōs that were there, and than Reynawde sayde to thē. Fayre maysters thinke to werke wel, for whan these stones ben layde and this morter occupyed I shall brynge you more. And whā the masons heard him speke so: they began to say amonge them that the churche of saynt Peter had founde a good labourer, &amp; that he ought to be well rewarded, By my fayth may∣ster sayde Reynawde I care not for no money. And whan came at euyn y<SUP>t</SUP> the laborers should leaue werke &amp; receyue theyr money: the Mayster Mason set him downe for to paye y<SUP>e</SUP> labourers, which tooke .v. penis a day. Than the mayster called Rey∣nawde and sayde to hym, come hy∣ther my fayre freende and take heere what it plese you, for ye haue serued better than any of thother, than put himself forth, &amp; tooke a peny sore a∣gaynst his wyl. And whan the mai∣ster saw that: he sayde to hym, by the bodi of God my fayre freend ye shal haue twenty more for els my consci¦ence should be charged wyth your labour, and yf ye wyl werke: ye shal euery daye haue so muche, for there was neuer so good a labourer as ye be one, Mayster sayde Reynawde yf ye wyl that I shal werke any more: giue me but one peny, whyche shall be for to bye bread for to susteyne w<SUP>t</SUP> all my body, for this that I doo: I doo it for the loue of God &amp; for none other. Freende sayde the Mayster, I wyll not trouble you no more, doo as ye wyll. Than tooke Reynawde leue of the mayster Mason and went to the towne for to get hymself a lod¦gynge and bought a penye worthe of bread, and so had he no more to his supper but bread and a litle water.</P>
<P>And whan he had eaten: he wēt and layed hym vpon a lytle strawe for to take his rest that nyght, and whā the day was come: Reynawd rose vp and went to hys worke and founde no body there, and than he went to the Churche and sayd his prayers a∣fore an ymage of our Ladye. This hangyng: the Masons came for to goe to theyr worke. And whan they were vpon the walle: they asked yf the stronge man were not com. May¦ster answered Reynawde I am heere wyll ye any thyng? Freend sayd thā the mayster Mason, bring vs stones and morter. Syr sayd Reynawde I shall wyth a good wyll and that a∣non. Than set he stones and morter in great plentie, and brought it vp vnto them. And I promyse you that Reynawde laded more at ones than xv. other dyd, and thus serued Rey∣nawde
<PB REF="176"/> the masons in the churche of saynt Peter at Coleyn many dayes and euery day at euyn he tooke hys peny of the mayster and no more for to by hym bread w<SUP>t</SUP> as ye haue heard for he eate neuer but bread &amp; dranke water. Thus liued Reynawde there a longe whyle seruing there the ma∣sons as it is sayd, for the loue of god and of saynt Peter, and dyd so truly his deuoyr that the other labourers had great enuy at him, for they were all set at nought (for y<SUP>e</SUP> loue of hym) of the masōs, for the great seruyce y<SUP>t</SUP> he did to them. Sore an angred were the other labourers whan they saw that they were all thus forsaken &amp; all set a syde and sayde to eche other in this wyse. By god we bē diffamed by thys greate knaue that dothe so muche labour, and therfore wee be put a side of the maysters, the greate deuyll brought hym well heere, for we shall neuer get nothyng as long as he is heere, for he serueth all the Masons alone of all that they need for to haue &amp; thus we ben left alone.</P>
<P>Then sayd one of them, my felowes yf ye wyl beleue me: we shal slea him How say ye that sayde a nother? ye wot well it is impossyble to vs to doo so, for he is horrible stronge, and yf we fet vpon hym: he shall kyll vs all. Freende sayd he I shall tell you how we shal doo so. Se you yonder vawte by the great house? Yea sayd thother. Wit it y<SUP>t</SUP> the great knaue go∣eth &amp; slepeth there euery night whan we ar gone home. And therfore yf ye wil beleue me: We shal go this night there where he is a slepe, and we shal take eche of vs a Pikeaxe, or els an hamer, and therwith we shall dasshe the brayne out of his head, and whā we haue thus slayne hym: wee shall put hym in a greate sacke and shall cast him w<SUP>t</SUP>in the riuer, that is there nyghe, &amp; thus shalbe no more hearde of hym. And whan the other labou∣rers heard this traytour speake thei accorded all to his counsel, and they dyd as they were purposed soner than they wende they should haue doo. For at noone whan the Masōs left worke and went to theyr dinner: the poore Reynawd went and rested hymselfe vnder the vawte, where he was wont to rest hymselfe euerye nyght. And whan the traytours saw that: they came to him that fyrst had spoken the treason and tooke hym a great hamer of a mason in hys hāde. And whan they spyed that Reynawd was fallen a sleape: thys traytour wyth the hamer went to Reynawde softlye and smote hym with the ha∣mer well deepe into the brayne. And whan Reynawde felte the stroke y<SUP>t</SUP> the traytour had gyuen hym: he set his armes in maner of a crosse vpon his brest and sayd in this maner. O good lorde Iesu Chryst haue mercye on my soule, and wyll pardon them that hath brought me to my death, and whan he had sayd these wordes: the soule departed out of the bodye. And whan the traytour had thus slayne Reynawde: they put hym in to a great sacke that they had ordey∣ned therfore, and than they laded the cart wherin they brought the stones with the body of hym, and so caryed
<PB N="Clxxi" REF="176"/> hym into the ryuer of Ryne, wherin they cast him, &amp; whā they had doone so: they laded the carte with stones &amp; brought them to the church worke as they were wont to doo, &amp; as they were by the way: they met the may∣ster mason, that sayd to thē. By my fayth galantes I con you now thā∣ke for ye mende your selfe. For ye haue doone great diligence syth dy∣ner that ye haue laden so many sto∣nes, and that ye ben so ferre wyth them to the worke warde. Mayster sayd the traytours mocke not wyth vs so, but go to your purse and giue vs some drynkyng money.</P>
<P>SOre meruayled was y<SUP>e</SUP> may∣ster of that he saw his labou∣rers more dilygent than they were accustumed. Than the labourers be∣gan to say to y<SUP>e</SUP> mayster of the worke by maner of a mocke, where is that great lurden that he helpeth not now I holde hym gone without leue, by cause he might not labour no lēger, for we heard say that he should neuer ceasse tyll he had founde hys wyfe agayne. And whan the mayster ma∣son heard that: he was sory and said to them agayne. By my fayth I be∣leue that ye haue chased hym away, but I promyse you yf I can wyt that ye haue doone so: it were better for you that ye were at Iherusalē. May∣ster sayd the labourers ye may well say to vs what ye wyll, but we dyd neuer say ought to him that shoulde displease hym. And whan the noble Reynawde was thus caste into the ryuer of Ryne by the labourers of the churche of saynt Peter: ye must wyt that he went not to the botome of the water, but went harde aboue the water a longe the streme. And at that: our Lorde shewed for hym a fayre myracle. For all the fysshe of the ryuer gathered them aboute the corps, and by the strength of the fis∣shes it was taried, and went no fer∣ther with the streme by the wyll of our lorde. And the great fysshes put theymself vnder hym and bare hym vpon the water so that he apered to euery mans syght. And there the fis∣shes bare him so vp vnto night. And whan the night was come: apered a∣boute the corps a great quantytie of torches by the vertue of our lorde, &amp; aungelles that songe there so melo∣dyously: that they that heard it wolde neuer haue gone fro it. And to saye trouth there was so greate lyght a∣boute the corps that all they y<SUP>t</SUP> sawe it wende that all the water of the Ryne had be a fyre. And whan the folke of the citie saw so great a mi∣racle: they ran all thyther bothe men and women and children. And also the archebisshop of saynt Peter we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thyther with al his college in a fayre processyon, syngyng by great deuo∣cion, and taryed vpon the Ryne, for they durste not goe no ferther, and they saw the fisshes that bare vp the Corps aboue the water. And whan they that were there saw that: they were abasshed &amp; meruayled greatlye what it might be, and began to saye y<SUP>e</SUP> one to the other. God what mai he be, for whome our lorde sheweth so fayre a myracle? Lordes sayd y<SUP>e</SUP> arch∣bysshop.
<PB REF="177"/> I shall tell you as myne a∣uyse giueth me. Wyt it that it is the bodye of some saynt that our Lorde wyll haue worshypped that is come heere from som where, whiche God wyl not that he be lost, nor drowned in the water. See ye not how the fis∣shes holde hym aboue the water, by the vertue of our lorde. Than y<SUP>e</SUP> bis∣shop commaunded that men should go see what it was, and anon folke went there w<SUP>t</SUP> botes, &amp; they founde y<SUP>t</SUP> it was the great man that was one of the labourers with the masons in the churche of saynt Peter. And whā the mayster of the worke sawe this: he was greatly abasshed, and went to them that had slayne hym, &amp; sayd to them in thys maner of wyse. Ye horesons false traytours, ye haue slayne y<SUP>e</SUP> good man, say ye y<SUP>e</SUP> trouth, for if ye deny it: I shal proue it vpon you. And whan y<SUP>e</SUP> labourers heard y<SUP>e</SUP> maister mason speke thus: they begā to crye, and sayd. By God mayster, we haue doone it without doubt for enuy that we had at hym. And ther∣fore let vs be drowned, hāged or dra∣wen, or what iustice ye wyll. For we haue well deserued for to be punys∣shed. And whan the archebysshop hearde the traytours speake so: he began for to weepe ful tenderly, and al his colege also. And the archebis∣shop was counselled that he should let go the murderers at theyr auen∣ture for to do penaunce for theyr sin∣nes, the whiche thynge the archebys∣shop dyd wyth a good wyll. Than was the body of Reynawde brought to lande, and was put vpon a carte for to beare hym to the church, wher as he was had worshypfully wyth fayre procession. And whan y<SUP>e</SUP> corps was in the church: the archebysshop made him redy for to syng the masse by great deuocion. And whan that y<SUP>e</SUP> seruice was doone: the archebysshop wolde haue gone a processyon with the corps aboute the churche, &amp; com∣maunded foure lordes y<SUP>t</SUP> were there that they should bere the corps. And than the barons wolde haue doone hys commaundement, but whan they came therto: they coulde not moue the corps by no strength that they could put therto. Sore mer∣uayled were the barons, whan they saw that, and sayd vnto eche other. Now may we well knowe that we be not worthy for to touche this ho∣ly corps. For we be wicked synners wherfore let vs go for to shriue vs &amp; put our selfe in good estate. And while that they spake thus together: the corps rose vp of hym selfe, and was borne, no man knoweth howe out of the churche into the carte, whi∣che anon moued and went his way∣es streyght out of the citie, wherof they were al greatly meruayled, and whan the carte was out of Coleyne: he went a pace all the hye waye. And whan the people saw that: they begā all to wepe bycause y<SUP>e</SUP> corps wolde not abyde. Than sayd the archebys∣shop vnto them. Syrs now may ye well see that this is a holy corps by the great myracles that our Lorde sheweth by him now, and al this day afore vs all. Wherfore let vs goe af∣ter him for to worship him. For it
<PB N="clxxii" REF="177"/> were not very well doone for to let hym go thus alone. My lorde sayd y<SUP>e</SUP> people, ye say wel, &amp; than al the cler∣gie and al the comyn people litle and great that myght go: folowed y<SUP>e</SUP> cor∣ps. And ye ought to wit that in all the citie of Coleyn abode nother mā nor woman, but went with y<SUP>e</SUP> corps and all the clergy folowed after sin∣gyng in great deuocion. So muche went the carte that he came to a ly∣tle towne that is called Croyne, and there he abode styll. And ye must wit that our lorde dyd shew there many fayre myracles for the loue of the ho∣ly body, for al sycke people of what syckenes it was that came there for to worshyp the holye bodye: Were whole incontinent. This happed of the noble knight Reynawde of moū¦tawban, as ye haue hearde. And ye ought to wyt that the renome of the holy body was so spred all aboute, that folke came to Croyne where it abode from ferre wayes for to seeke hym, and he made there so fayre my∣racles: that of all the Realme and of almayne folke drewe thether. And so muche were worthe the offringes that were done there within a short while: that of a litle chapell there as the bodye rested, whiche was of our lady, is now a royall churche and a great. And whan the holy body was abyden in this lytle chapell as it is sayd, where god made contynually miracles: the archebysshop of Co∣leyn &amp; al the clergi came to the corps &amp; vncouered his visage that euerye body should see him y<SUP>t</SUP> came there, yf haply y<SUP>e</SUP> ony man or woman myght know hym for to haue his name, for none coulde name hym, but the holy corps. But there came no man that could know. And whan the archebis¦shop saw y<SUP>t</SUP> no body could say what he was: he was sory for it, for yf he had knowen his name: he wold haue put him in a shrine of golde, bicause of the great miracles that he made dayly, for he made the defe to heare, y<SUP>e</SUP> blynde to see, the lame to go &amp; ryght many that were dombe he made to speake, &amp; often times apered tapres of wexe brennyng aboute the corps.</P>
<P>NOw shall ye heare howe the noble Reynawde was kno∣wen. Yee ought to wyt that the bre∣thern of Reynawde, that is to wyt Alarde, Guicharde &amp; Richarde were on a daye vpon mountayne so sorye that they could heare no tidinges of theyr brother Reynawde. Than cam a Pylgrime forth by that salued the barons. Pylgrime sayde Alarde, fro whēs come ye? yf ye wot any tydin∣ges tel it vs I pray you. Lordes said the pilgrime w<SUP>t</SUP> a good wyll I shall tell you that I know. Wyt it that I come out of Almaine, from a towne that is called Croyne by Coleyne v∣pon the ryne, where I haue seen ma∣ny great miracles doone of god, for the loue of a man that came to the Citie but late ago, the which was so great that euery body said there that he was a Giaunte. And wyt ye that whan he came there: y<SUP>t</SUP> he sawe men make the churche of saynt Peter, so dyd he present there hys seruyce to the mayster mason, the whiche retey¦ned
<PB REF="178"/> hym gladly. Shortly for to say: this great man dyd wonder of bea∣ryng of stones and of morter. For he bare more at ones: than .xv. other of the labourers that were there with him, and he was all day w<SUP>t</SUP>out meate saue at euyn: he tooke a peny that he gate, for no more he wolde haue for hys laboure a day, and therwyth he bought hym a peny lose, and dranke none other to it, but water, and thā he went to his rest vpon a litle straw vnder a great vaute. And ye muste wyt, that this great man was well loued of the maysters masons of the sayd churche, whyche wolde often haue gyuen him meate and wyne, &amp; more money. But he wolde neuer take nothyng but a peny onely by y<SUP>e</SUP> day, for to bye hym selfe a peny lofe as I told you afore. He serued so wel all the masons there that they were more contente of hym alone: then of the other labourers. And whan the labourers saw that they were so ly∣tle set by for y<SUP>e</SUP> loue of this great mā: they were sore an angred, and tooke great enuy at hym and conspired to∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther for to slea hym shamefully.</P>
<P>So dyd they aspye hym where as he slept vnder the vaute, whyle that y<SUP>e</SUP> mayster masons were gone to theyr dyner: and then one of theym came to hym with great hamer in his hād and brayned him, then they put hym in a sacke and caryed him in a carte to the Ryuer of the Ryne, where they cast hym. And wyt it that whā they had doone so: our lorde shewed there a great myracle. For al the fis∣shes of the Ryne assembled them a∣boute the corps, and made it abyde in one place aboue the water. And whan that the nyght was come: aun∣gelles were hearde there, whyche songe melodiously the seruyce of the dead so hye: that all they of the Citie might haue heard them, and it semed that al y<SUP>e</SUP> water about hym had ben in a fyre of the greate lyght that was seen there. Than came the archebis∣shop of Coleyne wyth all his colege and made the corps to be taken and brought in a Carte to the Churche. And whan he was there: the Arche∣bysshop songe masse, for this was in the mornyng, and whan that the seruyce was doone: the Achebysshop sayd to foure Lordes whyche were there, that they should take vp the corps for to haue him into his graue wyth fayre prosessyon. But these foure barons coulde neuer moue hī from y<SUP>e</SUP> place where as he was. But the corps incontynent to euery bo∣dies sight, that was there, was brou¦ght into the carte agayne, wyth the twynkelyng of an eye, and sodeynly the carte departed, and wente away alone out of the towne, as good a pace as thoughe ten horses had dra∣wen at it, whyche was sore agaynst the wyll of the people that wept ful tenderly, bycause that it wolde not a byde with them. But all they of the Cytye, bothe lytle and great went a processyon after it, vnto a lytle town where the corps of the great man a∣bode styll whyche is called Croyne in a lytle chapell of our lady, where he doth now many a fayre myracle, for I ensure you y<SUP>t</SUP> al the sicke folkes
<PB N="clxxii" REF="178"/> y<SUP>t</SUP> seeke him there be made whole, &amp; returne to their home in good helth. And so I haue left there the archebis¦shop of Coleyne, and all the clergye that hath doo make of y<SUP>e</SUP> offerynges that ben gyuen there vnto thys holy corps a fayre place and a roial chur∣che, there as the sayd chapell of oure lady was afore.</P>
<P>WHan Alarde, Guicharde and Rycharde, heard the pilgry∣me speake so: they began all three to weepe ful sore for pitie that they had of theyr brother reynawde, for well they knew, it was he of whome the Pylgryme spake of. Alas my bre∣thern sayd Rycharde. Now ben w<SUP>t</SUP> well destroyed, and vndoone for euer more. For I know wel that it is out deere brother that we haue sought so longe. Wyt it y<SUP>t</SUP> the three brethern made there so great sorowe, that it cannot be rehersed. And whan they had made this greate sorowe: they tooke leaue of the pilgrime and thā∣ked hym, and went to make them re∣dy, &amp; than tooke theyr waye toward Croyne, by Coleyne vpon the Ryne. And they dyd so muche by theyr iour¦neys: that they came vnto Croyne.</P>
<P>And lyghted before the churche they and theyr folke, where they found so great flowyng and gatheryng of the people and so great prese of folke: y<SUP>t</SUP> wyth great payne they myght entre wythin the Churche. And whan the knyghtes were within: they wente nyghe the holye corps that was v∣pon a fayre bere all vncouered, and saw so great lyght aboute the corps as there had ben an hundred torches Than wente they as nyghe hym as they coulde for to looke hym in the face and anon thei knew that he was theyr brother, &amp; with that they loked vpon hym: they fell downe in a swo∣une to the erth. And whan the arche¦bysshop saw that: he was sore abas∣shed and sayd to some of his Colege. Syrs I beleue that wee shall soone know that we haue desyred so long. For I wene that these lordes knowe wel this holy corps. This hanging: were the three brethern comē agayn to themselfe, and began to crye and fare as they had ben mad, than sayd Alarde al weepynge in thys maner, Alas what shall we nowe caytyfes knyghtes doo, poore of honour and of al wele, syth that we haue lost our brother by whome we were so sore doubted and dred? Alas deere brother who was so hardy to laye hande on you? I beleue that he knew not your debonayrtie &amp; kindnes, for he wolde not haue slayne you so crueltye. And than he turned hym towarde hys two brethern and sayd. My fayre bre¦thern we ought wel to be sory, syth y<SUP>t</SUP> we haue lost our brother Reinawde that was all our hope our trust and comfort. Alas sayde Rycharde, bro∣ther Reinawde whi had ye euer that courage for to habandone vs as ye did: seyng that ye loued vs so mu∣che? Alas ye stale awaye yourself by night, for to come amonge y<SUP>e</SUP> handes of the murderers, that haue slayne you so cruelly. Alas they wyst not y<SUP>e</SUP> great domage that is of your death.
<PB REF="179"/> whan the three brethern had wepte ynoughe in great sobbynges and la∣mentacions, for y<SUP>e</SUP> loue of theyr deere brother Reynawde: they went &amp; kis∣sed the corps on the mouth, the one after the other, and with this thei fel downe agayne in swoune. And whā they were come agayn to themselfe: Rycharde began to crye and saye. A∣las fayre brethern, now ben we loste for euer. For we shall no more be set by, nother doubted, nor dred more than children, wherefore I say that we should slea our selfe, to the ende that we may be with you, for we ou∣ght not to liue after your death. Wit it y<SUP>t</SUP> who had be there he should haue had an harde hert but he should haue wept for to see y<SUP>e</SUP> three brethern make theyr mone.</P>
<P>WHan the archebishop and y<SUP>e</SUP> Burgeys that were there saw the great sorowe that the three knightes made: the good Archebys∣shop came to them and sayd, Lordes be ye not dyspleased of that I shall say to you. Syrs to my semynge, ye doo not wel for to make so great so∣row nor to discomfort your selfe so muche as ye do, but rather ye should make great ioy, and be glad for your brother that is a saynt in heuen, the whyche had suffred martyrdom in y<SUP>e</SUP> seruice of our lorde, wherof ye may see that he rewardeth him wel for it. For ye see now before your eyen the great miracles y<SUP>t</SUP> he dooth, wherfore I pray you that ye wyll recomforte your selfe. And tell vs yf it please you what ye ben, and howe is thys holy body named, and what hys na∣me was whā he liued in this worlde to the ende that his name be wryten aboute his tombe? And whan his bre¦thern heard the archebysshop speake thus: they began a lytle to leue theyr sorow. And than Alarde that was theldest after Reynawde sayd to him Lorde sythe it please you to knowe what we be and howe this corps is called: I shall tel it you w<SUP>t</SUP>out faute. Ye muste wyt that this corps was called (whan he was amonge vs ali∣ue) Reynawde of Mountawban the ryght worthy knyght, and we three that ben heere are his brethern, and wel I wot that ye haue heard speake of the foure sonnes of Aymon, the whiche Charlemayne the great king of Fraunce warred so longe. Than whan the archebysshop and the peo∣ple hearde that they were the foure sonnes of Aymon, of the whyche all the worlde spake, and that the holy corps was the goood Reynawde of Mountawbā the noble and valiant knight: they began all to weepe for pitie and for ioye, bycause they sawe al before them the moste noble &amp; wor¦thiest knyght of the worlde, that in his lyfe was more to drede than any man alyue, that was dead in the ser¦uyse of our lorde, doinge penaunce. After that these three bretherne had thus left a lytle theyr sorowe: they made theyr brother to be layde in his tombe, that was right riche, that the archebisshop had doone make where the holy corps resteth yet at this day as euydently is knowen, and he is called saynt Reynawde the martyr.
<PB N="Clxxiiii" REF="179"/> The memory of him was that time put in wrytyng auctentykly, &amp; eueri yere is there kept for him great solēp¦nitie and feast. And after the sepul∣turyng of the holye corps: the bre∣thern went agayne into theyr owne Countrie.</P>
<TRAILER>MY fayre lordes who that this present booke shall rede or heare, we shall pray our lorde god &amp; the gloryous Saynt Reynawde the marter, that he giue vs grace to per∣seuer, and continue our lyfe in good workes, by the whiche we may haue at our endyng the life that euer shal last. AMEN.</TRAILER>
