This poore man although he dwelt quietlie with his new found hoast, and might also vse and take such as he got in the wil∣dernesse, yet louing libertie, on a time g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t foorth of the

It fortuned afterward, this same Lion to be ta∣ken and sent also to Rome, to be there kept among o∣ther sauadge and wilde beasts. Not long after this, the same condemned bondman, was amongst others ap∣pointed also to the slaughter, &amp; brought into the field called Campus Circulus, to trie his fortune with some wild beast, and to conclude, it was his good hap to in∣counter with that Lion which hee before had cured: Assoone as this hungrie ramping Lion had espied that man, as one desirous of his praie, he ran towards him to haue deuoured him, but when hee perceiued well that he was the verie man that had lodged with him in his den, and done him good, he straightwaie stood ouer the man, defending him from the crueltie of anie other beast. When the man who exspected nothing but death, had well considered the humanitie of the beast, and throughlie regarded him, he was then assu∣red that it was his quondam hoste in the deserts, and therevpon made the bolder to touch him, and so stro∣ked and cherished him. The Emperour and the whole state of Rome stood still, abashed at this strange &amp; rare sight, and after a little staie made, caused to be inquired of the man, whether he were a Nigromancer, or whe∣ther he had inchanted the Lion, seeing that he was hunger-prickt, and yet had no power to hurt him: to this he answered, that his safetie came by the gentle∣nesse of the beast, and not of anie power of his owne, and reported at large the cause of that clemencie, as be∣fore
<PB REF="3"/> is expressed. To be short, the man had his life, and licence to beg vp and downe the streets of Rome, leading the Lion in his hand, vpon whose breast was written as followeth. Hic Leo est hospes, huius hominis. and in the forepart of his coate was set downe, Hic homo est medicus huius Leonis. To auoid this horrible sinne, I haue (Right worshipfull) presumed to dedicate vnto your worship, the true reports of my troubles, &amp; of certeine others in Turkie, which although they be not set out with braue termes, yet is in them set downe nothing but plaine troth, easie to be told, but hard to be tollera∣ted: beseeching your worship, as frēdlie to accept of the same, as I willinglie present it, which if it were answe∣rable to my desires, should then signifie what heart I carrie to your worship, vnto whom I confesse my selfe most wholie bounden, and least my rude speeches should sauor of flatterie.

<HEAD>OF A MOST LAMEN∣table voiage made into Trypolie in Barbarie, in a Ship called the IESVS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THis voiage was set foorth by the right wor∣shipful, sir <HI>Edward Osburne</HI> knight, cheefe merchant of all the Turkish companie, &amp; one maister <HI>Richard Stapers,</HI> the ship being of the burthen of one hundred tun, called the <HI>Iesus,</HI> shée was builded at <HI>Farmne</HI> a riuer by <HI>Portsmoth,</HI> The owners were M. <HI>Thomas Thomson, Ni∣cholas Carnabie,</HI> &amp; <HI>Iohn Gilman.</HI> The Maister (vnder God) was one <HI>Aches Hellier</HI> of <HI>Blackwall,</HI> and hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mate was one <HI>Richard Morris</HI> of that place: their Pilot was one <HI>An∣thony Ierado</HI> a French man, of the Prouince of <HI>Massillins:</HI> the Purser was one <HI>William Thomson</HI> our owners son, the marchants factors were <HI>Romaine Sonnings</HI> a French∣man, and <HI>Richard Skegs,</HI> seruant vnto the said maister <HI>Stapers:</HI> y<SUP>e</SUP> owners were bound vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> merchāts by charter partie thereupon, in one thousand marks, y<SUP>t</SUP> the said ship by Gods permission should go for <HI>Tripoly</HI> in <HI>Barbarie:</HI> that is to saie, first from <HI>Portsmouth</HI> to <HI>Newhauen</HI> in <HI>Norman∣die:</HI> from thence to saint <HI>Lukar,</HI> otherwise called <HI>S.

The cō∣modities of y<SUP>e</SUP> place is swéet oiles: y<SUP>e</SUP> king there is a marchāt
<PB REF="5"/> and the rather willing to preferre himselfe before his com∣mons, requested our said factors to trafike with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king of Tripolie a marchant.</NOTE> and promised them that if they would take his oiles at his owne price, they should paie no maner of custome, and they tooke of him certeine Tuns of Oile: &amp; afterward percei∣uing that they might haue far better cheape, notwithstand∣ing the custome frée, they desired the King to licence them to take the Oiles at the pleasure of his commons, for that his price did exceed theirs: wherevnto the king would not agree, but was rather contented to abate his price: inso∣much that the factors bought all their Oiles of the Kings custome free, and so laded the same aboord.</P>
<P>In the meane time there came to that place one <HI>Miles Dickenson,</HI> in a Ship of <HI>Bristow,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another ship of Bristowe came to Tri∣polie.</NOTE> who togither with our said factors, tooke a house to themselues there Our French factor <HI>Romaine Sonnings,</HI> desirous to buie a commoditie in the market, and wanting monie, desired the said <HI>Miles Dickenson</HI> to lend him a hundred <HI>Chikinoes</HI> vntill he came to his lodging, which he did,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A French fac∣tor beguiled an English factor.</NOTE> and afterward the same <HI>Sonnings</HI> met with <HI>Miles Dickenson</HI> in the stréet, and de∣liuered him monie bound vp in a napkin: saieng, maister <HI>Dickenson</HI> there is the monie that I borowed of you, and so thanked him for the same: he doubting nothing lesse then falshood, which is sildome knowne among marchants, &amp; speciallie being togither in one house, &amp; is the more detest∣able betwéen Christians, then being in Turkie among the heathen: the said <HI>Dickenson</HI> did not tell the monie present∣lie, vntill he came to his lodging, and then finding nine <HI>Chikinoes</HI> lacking of his hundred, which was aboue three pounds▪ for that euerie <HI>Chikinoe</HI> is worth seauen shillings of English monie: he came to the said <HI>Romaine Sonnings</HI> and deliuered him his handkercher, and asked him how manie <HI>Chikinoes</HI> he had deliuered him, <HI>Sonnings</HI> answe∣red, a hundred: <HI>Dickenson</HI> said no: and so they protested and swore on both parts: but in the end the said <HI>Romaine Sonnings</HI> did sweare deepelie with detestable othes▪<NOTE PLACE="marg">The French factor desired vengeance to light on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im∣selfe, which God brought to passe for an example to bla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>phemous swearers.</NOTE> and cursses, and praied God that he might shew his works on him, that other might take ensample thereby, and that he
<PB REF="6"/> might be hanged like a Dog, and neuer come into Eng∣land againe, if he did not deliuer vnto the said <HI>Dickenson</HI> an hundred <HI>Chekinoes.</HI> And héere beholde a notable ex∣ample for all blasphemers, curssers, and swearers, how GOD rewarded him accordinglie, for manie times it commeth to passe, that GOD sheweth his miracles vpon such monstrous blasphemers, to the insample of others, as now héereafter you shall héere what befell to this <HI>Romaine Sonnings.</HI></P>
<P>There was a man in the said Towne a pledge, whose name was <HI>Patrone Norado,</HI> who the yeare before had doone this <HI>Sonnings</HI> some pleasure there. The foresaid <HI>Patrone Norado</HI> was indebted vnto a Turke of that Towne, in the summe of foure hundred and fiftie crownes, for certeine goods sent by him into Christendome in a Ship of his owne, and by his owne brother, and him∣selfe remained in <HI>Tripolie</HI> as pledge, vntill his said brothers returne: and as the reporte went there, that after his brothers arriuall into Christendome, hee came among lewde companie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A conspiracie practised by the French Factor, to de∣ceiue a Tur∣kish mar∣chant of 450 crownes.</NOTE> and loste his brothers said Ship and goods at dice, and neuer returned vnto him againe. The said <HI>Patrone Norado</HI> being voide of all hope, and finding nowe opportunitie, consulted with the said <HI>Son∣nings</HI> for to swimme a seaboord the Ilands, and the Ship being then out of danger, should take him in, as after was confessed, and so to goe to <HI>Tallowne</HI> in the prouince of <HI>Massillins,</HI> with this <HI>Patrone Norado,</HI> and there to take in the rest of his lading. The Ship being readie the first daie of Maie, and hauing hir Sailes all abroad, our said Factors did take their leaue of the King, who verie courteouslie bid them farewell, and when they came aboord, they commanded the Maister and the companie hastelie to get out the Ship: the Maister answered that it was vnpossible, for that the winde was contrarie and ouerblowed. And hee required vs vpon forfeiture of our bands, that we should doo our indeuour to get hir foorth, then went we to warpe out the Ship, and presentlie the king sent a bote aboord of vs, with thrée men in hir, com∣manding
<PB REF="6"/> the said <HI>Sonnings</HI> to come a shore: at whose comming, the King demanded of him custome for the Oiles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king of Tripolie swarueth frō his promise, through co∣uetousnesse.</NOTE> <HI>Sonnings</HI> aunswered him that his highnesse had promised to deliuer them custome frée: but notwithstand∣ing the king weighed not his said promise, and as an In∣fidell that hath not the feare of GOD before his eies, nor regarde of his word, albeit he was a King: he caused the said <HI>Sonnings</HI> to paie the custome to the vttermost pen∣nie. And afterward willed him to make haste awaie, saieng, that the <HI>Ienizaries</HI> would haue the Oile a shore a∣gaine. These <HI>Ienizaries</HI> are souldiours there vnder the Great Turke, and their power is aboue the Kings. And so the said Factor departed from the King, and came to the water side, and called for a bote to come a boorde, and hee brought with him the foresaid <HI>Patrone Norado.</HI> The companie inquisitiue to know what man that was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The begin∣ning of their troubles, and occasion of all their miserie.</NOTE> <HI>Sonnings</HI> aunswered, that he was his countriman, a passenger: I praie GOD said the Companie, that we come not into trouble by this man. Then said <HI>Sonnings</HI> angerlie, what haue you to doo with anie matters of mine, if anie thing chaunce otherwise then well, I must an∣swer for all.</P>
<P>Nowe the Turke vnto whome this <HI>Patrone Norado</HI> was indebted, missing him, supposed him to be aboord of our Ship, and presentlie went vnto the King, and told him that he thought that his pledge <HI>Patrone Norado</HI> was aboord of the English Ship, wherevpon the King present∣lie sent a bote aboord of vs, with thrée men in hir, com∣manding the said <HI>Sonnings</HI> to come a shore, and not speak∣ing anie thing as touching the man, he said that he would come presentlie in his owne bote, but assoone as they were gone, hee willed vs to warpe foorth the Ship, and said that hee woulde sée the knaues hanged before he would goe a shore. And when the King saw that hee came not a shore, but still continued warping awaie the Ship, he straight commanded the Gunner of the Bul∣warke next vnto vs, to shoote thrée shootes without ball.
<PB REF="7"/> Then we came all to the said <HI>Sonnings,</HI> and asked of him what the matter was, that we were shot at, he said that it was the <HI>Ienezaries</HI> would haue the oile a shore againe, and willed vs to make hast awaie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All the Tur∣k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h gunners in T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rpo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie commanded to doo their best to sinke the IESVS, but could n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> once hit hir.</NOTE> and after that he had dis∣charged thrée shots without ball, he command<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d all the gunners in the towne to doo their indeuoure to sinke vs, but the Turkish gunners could not once strike vs, where∣fore the king sent presentlie to the <HI>Baneo:</HI> this <HI>Baneo</HI> is the prison whereas all the captiues laie at night, and promised if that there were anie that could either sinke vs, or else cause vs to come in againe, he should haue a hundred crownes and his libertie. With that came foorth a Spani∣ard called <HI>Sebastian,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A proclam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tion m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, that whoso∣euer could sinke hir, or bring hir in should haue a C. crownes, &amp; if he were a captiue he should haue his libertie. How a Spani∣ard tooke it in hand, and brought it to passe, &amp; made the Ship to yeeld.</NOTE> which had béene an old seruitor in Flanders, and he said, that vpon performance of that pro∣mise, he would vndertake either to sinke vs, or to cause vs to come in againe, and thereto he would gage his life, and at the first shot he splyt our Rothers head in peeces, and the second shot he strake vs vnder water, and the third shot he shot vs through our foremast with a Coluerlyn shot, &amp; thus he hauing rent both our Rother &amp; Mast, and shot vs vnder water, we were inforced to go in againe. This <HI>Sebastian</HI> for all his diligence héerein, had neither his libertie nor an hundred crownes, so promised by the said king, but after his seruice doone, was committed againe to prison, wherby may appeare the regard that a Turke or Infidell hath of his woord, although he be able to performe it, yea more, though he be a King.</P>
<P>Then our marchants séeing no remedie, they toge∣ther with fiue of our companie went a shore, and then they ceased shooting, they shot vnto vs in the whole nine and thirtie shootes, without the hurt of anie man.
