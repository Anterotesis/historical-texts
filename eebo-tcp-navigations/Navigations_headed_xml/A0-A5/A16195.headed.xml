<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>Cap. 1. ¶ Of the partes of this new Astrolabe.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His <HI>Astrolabe</HI> hath three generall partes, that is to say, the <HI>Celestiall,</HI> the <HI>Zenitfer</HI> with his <HI>Cursor,</HI> and the <HI>Almicantifer</HI> with his <HI>Pointer.</HI></P>
<P>I call that part the <HI>Celestiall</HI> heere, which in other Astrolabes is called the <HI>Mate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> of which I will largely speake in the next Chap.</P>
<P>The <HI>Zenitfer</HI> beeing but as a playne rule of one ynch bredth, mooueth vpon the <HI>Celestiall</HI> in stead of a <HI>Reete</HI> vsed in other Astrolabes: and hath a circular Lymbe thereto annexed neere vnto the Centre, which I call the <HI>Circulus horarius,</HI> or houre circle, with the 24. houres, and their partes thereon, as you see. Neither is it materiall of what quantity that houre circle or lymbe be of, so it be con∣centricke to the Astrolabe, and placed so, that it hide fewest Starres in his moouing. And for seruice of this circle, there is written at the vpper end of this Zenitfer <HI>Meridies,</HI> and at
<PB REF="6"/> the lower end <HI>Media nox,</HI> and therefore the fiduciall line thereof from the Centre vpwards to <HI>Meridies,</HI> is generally called the <HI>Noone line,</HI> the other part from the Centre downe∣wardes vnto <HI>Media nox</HI> the <HI>North line.</HI> Then hath it 90 <HI>Zenith lines</HI> standing in ascents one aboue another like Or∣gan pipes, in stead of the 90 generall <HI>Horizons</HI> before time vsed, issuing or growing out of the 90 <HI>Zenith points:</HI> for the lowest points of these 90 lines neerest vnto the centre vnto which their numbers are set from 0 to 90, do represent the true <HI>Zenithes</HI> of all places. These 90. <HI>Zenith lines,</HI> are by certaine thwart curued lines parted euery one into 90 vn∣euen parts, of which some run out infinitely, and those partes I call the <HI>Altitude rootes,</HI> or the <HI>Almicantare rootes,</HI> and for breuities sake sometimes <HI>Rootes</HI> without any addition. These <HI>Rootes</HI> do helpe vs to generall <HI>Almicantares,</HI> or circles of Altitude for any Latitude by a rare deuise by me first found out. They are numbered on the outer side of the <HI>Zenitfer</HI> from their extreame points inwards towards their sayd <HI>Zenith points,</HI> ending at them with 90. Also to the Fiduciall line of this <HI>Zenitfer</HI> is anexed a scale, in which are planted the Ra∣diall degrees of the proiectement on both sides of the Scale, because they require double numbering for sundry purposes. And of those which bound on the Fiduciall line, those at the noone line are numbered from the Equinoctiall intersection both waies, <HI>vz.</HI> towards <HI>Meridies,</HI> as farre as the <HI>Zenithfer</HI> will giue leaue, which are about 36, and towards the Centre, ending there at 90. which 90 radiall degrees of the noone line towards the Centre do serue (with the other 36) to descry the declinations of the fixed Starres and Planets, but chiefely they serue for the 90 Zenithes which appertaine to the 90 generall Horizons, and for distinction sake I call them the 90 <HI>Verticall points,</HI> and they exactly answere vnto the 90. lower ends of the 90 <HI>Zenith lines,</HI> which before I called the 90 <HI>Ze∣nith points,</HI> in so much that the fiduciall line of the <HI>Cursor</HI> in his moouing, cutteth the <HI>Zenith point,</HI> and the <HI>Verticall point</HI>
<PB REF="6"/> of any latitude both at once. The other <HI>Radiall</HI> degrees in the <HI>North line,</HI> are numbred from the centre towards <HI>Media nox,</HI> ending at the Equinoctials intersexion therewith at 90, and do serue for the 90 intersections of the 90 generall <HI>Horizons</HI> therewith, and therefore I call them the 90 <HI>Horizontall points.</HI> And of those radyall degrees which bound on the other side of the Scale, which indeede serue to the getting of the 12 houses generally, as is shewed in the 27 Cap. The Norther 90 towards <HI>Media nox</HI> are numbred inwards to∣wards the Centre, ending there at 90 contrary to the former. And the Souther of those radiall degrees are numbred from the Centre outwards towards <HI>Meridies</HI> two to one, as farre as they will go, (that is to say) euery 10 make but 5, and these do serue but in stead of rootes to the other, and there∣fore I call them the <HI>Domifieng rootes.</HI> Also there adioyneth vnto the Radiall scale of the North line betweene the centre and the Zenith lines a certaine scale of slope lines numbered in the middest, beginning but from 60 and ending at the centre with 90, which I call the <HI>Domifieng Scale,</HI> for that the two extreames of euery of those slope lines, do help to get 8 of the 12 houses in that latitude, whose number it sheweth, as in the 27 Cap. is manifested: and vnto the outer edge of this <HI>Domifieng scale,</HI> are also anexed part of the former ra∣diall degrees, all hauing relacion to them on the North line. Then hath this <HI>Zenitfer</HI> a certaine runner or <HI>Cursor,</HI> whose fiduciall line alwayes runneth exactly square to the fiduciall line of the <HI>Zenitfer.</HI> And at the common meeting of both those fiduciall lines, this <HI>Cursor</HI> hath iointed vnto him a kinde of Labell or loose scale, which I call the <HI>Almicantifer,</HI> who to supply the generall vse of the <HI>Almicantares,</HI> hath no manner of matter on him but another <HI>Cursor,</HI> which I call a <HI>Pointer.</HI></P>
<P>But now for any man that desireth to haue this Astro∣labe more particularly commodious for one latitude, <HI>vz.</HI> for the countrey or place of his abode, then shall he haue a kinde
<PB REF="7"/> of Reete or moouer made, carying a circle or limbe of houres of equall diametre to the <HI>Celestiall,</HI> and within it the <HI>Horizon</HI> circle of that place particularly described after <HI>Stophlerus,</HI> and graduated into his 360 prospectiue degrees, as in the fourth booke 4. Cap. of my Iewell is taught, toge∣ther with the arches distinguishing the 12 houses, as in <HI>Stoph. lib.</HI> 1. <HI>propo.</HI> 6. is taught, writing to each house his number and significations. And vnto the noone-line furni∣shed with the former radiall degrees, numbred from the <HI>Ho∣rizon</HI> circle, into twise 90. both ending at the <HI>Verticall</HI> point, you shall neede to annexe but only one of the 90 Zenith lines, <HI>vz.</HI> that which serueth to your latitude and his rootes, with the <HI>Cursor:</HI> Neither neede your <HI>Almicantifer</HI> haue his sliding pointer, but in stead thereof, the particuler degrees of altitude seruing to that latitude, which are compounded of his 90 Zenith rootes, and the 90 radiall degrees in the North line, as in the 19 Cap. is taught, all which shall better appeare by such Astrolabes as I meane to set abroade ready furnished.</P>

<HEAD>Cap. 2. ¶ Of the Celestiall proiectment in this new Astrolabe, and how the longitudes and latitudes of the Starres are thereby had.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>Eedlesse it is to stand vpon the Fa∣brication, or long particularizing of this Instrument or his partes, since they are but the <HI>Copernician</HI> representation of the constellations fixed, and the 90 generall <HI>Horizons</HI> moouing.</P>
<P>The Fixed part which in other Astrolabes is called the <HI>Mater,</HI> I call for breuities sake the <HI>Celestiall,</HI> For that in it I haue
<PB REF="7"/> prospectiuely proiected the Globe Celestiall, that is to say, the Globe of the fixed Starres, with the <HI>Zodiack,</HI> and his North Pole (marked with <HI>D</HI>) the Images of each constel∣lation, and the Starres appertaining, in such sort as in the Globe they are vsuall, with each fift circle of Longitude and Latitude of the Zodiacke, Euery sixe of those fiues of the Longitude including a signe in the heauens, being 12 in the whole, which 12 are distinguished with twisted lines some∣what bigger from the rest, and vnto them neere vnto the Limbe are written the names of the 12 Signes as they passe in order, <HI>Aries, Taurus, &amp;c.</HI> together with their natures and quallities. Also, those three Signes of the watry triplicitie are filled vp with waues, and the three fiery with flames, and the three earthy with bigge prickes, and the three ayry left white. Then are there seuen seuerall magnitudes of Starres, each bigger and brighter then other, whose fashions are set downe with their numbers in the Signe ♊ before the brest of <HI>Orion,</HI> by which they are easily heerein descryed. The excentricke circle <HI>Orbs</HI> or Lymbe, lying wholy within it, is the Zodiacke deuided into his 12 Signes by the fore∣sayd 12 mayster circles of longitude, and euery Signe into his 30 prospectiue degrees. Also the degrees are made with, diuers distinguishments, for the <HI>Gradus masculini, feminini, lucidi, tenebrosi, vacui, fumosi, puteales, fortunam augentes, &amp; debilitantes,</HI> all which are sufficiently to be descryed by the two <HI>Directoria Zodiaci</HI> there placed. Then is there a little within the Zodiacke a rowe of Carecters of the Planets pla∣ced at euery 10 circle of longitude, signifying the faces of the Planets, and likewise another rowe without the Zodiacke at the beginning of the termes of the Planets, euery face and terme continuing vnto the carect next him in <HI>sequens</HI> of the Zodiacke, all which will better appeare, if you ioyne vnto this booke <HI>Claudius Dariot</HI> his introduction to the iudge∣ment of the Starres, which by good hap is now newly im∣printed in english together with this, and a second part there∣with,
<PB REF="8"/> which at the first impression was omitted. And speci∣ally you must note and remember well, that the very outer∣most circle of this Zodiacke, is the clipticke circle, within which is contayned the North-halfe or Hemispheere of all the Starres and Constellacions in the heauens, and without it so many of the South Starres and Constellacions, as the proiectment would admit. Then is there also lying within this Astrolabe a blacke concentricke circle, representing the <HI>Aequinoctiall</HI> circle, and proiector of this worke, but without any diuisions, because they are better supplyed by the limbe. Also there is a scale of the radiall degrees, where∣on this proiectement is made, placed at the master circle of longit. beginning the Signe ♋ numbred from the Equi∣noctiall both wayes, which Equinoctiall cutteth the sayde eclipticke circle in the pointes <HI>B</HI> and <HI>C</HI> beginning ♈ and ♎, and those points are called the two <HI>Aequinoctiall Inter∣sectiones</HI> which do mooue vppon the poles of the <HI>Zodiacke</HI> backwards, or <HI>in precedentia,</HI> of the Signes euery 67 yeares almost a degree equally: carying about with them all the foresayde circles of Longitude and Latitude, leauing the Starres stocke still in their places, By which meanes it commeth to passe, that although the fixed Starres haue no manner of motion at all, yet they seeme from time to time to haue gone as is sayd euery 67 yeares almost a degree for∣wards, as the auncient Astronomers thought: where as in very deede (as <HI>Copernicus</HI> sheweth) the <HI>Zodiacke</HI> and all his circles do slide so much backwards from them: And by reason this sliding backe of the <HI>Aequinoctiall</HI> points, is as I haue sayd performed on the poles <HI>D</HI> and his opposite of the clipticke, therefore it commeth to passe that the fixed Starres could thereby neuer change theyr Latitudes, but keepe the same Latitudes as euer they did. This sliding backe, is called <HI>Precessio Aequinoctiorum,</HI> of which wee will in∣treate more in the 30 Cap. And now will returne to this proiectement: In which it is very easye to imagine euery
<PB REF="8"/> square into fiue equall partes, and so thereby to knowe the Longitude and Latitude of any Starre therein sufficient for any common vse. As for example, the great Starre in the left foote of <HI>Orion,</HI> placed in the Signe ♊, if you imagin the spaces betweene each fiue circles of Longitude and Lati∣tude deuided into fiue partes, then shall you conceaue that the middle pricke of this Starre is heere in longitude about 9 degrees 30 minut. of ♊, and in latitude South from the clipticke circle about some 31 degrees 30 min. and so for any of the rest.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N my <HI>Organum Vranicum</HI> shortly like to come foorth, you shall haue the Kalender of the yere, the Cicle of the Sunne, and all such necessary supplements. And therefore in this Astrolabe, which I do appoint to be alwayes anexed thereunto, and to be but the back side, or <HI>Dorsum Vranici,</HI> I haue framed no Kalender at all or Theoricke of the ☉ as commonly all other Astrolabes haue. Yet to serue the turne vntill the <HI>Vranicum</HI> come foorth, or for them that would content themselues without the other, as happily some will in regard of the charge of the other, which can not well be framed but of mettall, I haue in the 12 Signes of the Zodiackes <HI>Orbs</HI> placed the 12 letters of the 12 Moneths, <HI>vz. I</HI> for Ianuary, <HI>F</HI> for February, &amp;c. at such degree and minute of the-clipticke as they doe make their entraunce the <HI>Radicall</HI> yeare of my sayd <HI>Vranicum,</HI> being the
<PB REF="11"/> yeare after Christ 1600. by help of which you shall for euer it you will, finde the true place of the Sunne within 3 or 4 minutes, so you regard but three obseruaunces which I shall heere deliuer you. The first is, concerning the Leape yeare, and is remedied by rebating some quarter of a degree for euery yeare following the Leape yeare till it be Leape yeare againe. The second is, concerning the fiue odde dayes in the yeare aboue 360. and is remedied by rebating for euery day of the moneth, proposed but one minute. The third is, con∣cerning ages past or to come, the remedie whereof, I will shew in the end of this Cap. Now therefore for the time pre∣sent, <HI>vz.</HI> for some 20 yeares if neede be before or behinde the yeare 1600. it serueth fitly as it is vpon euery Leape yeare, (because his roote 1600 is a Leape yeare) without any obser∣uacion more then for the fiue odde dayes which is generall in euery yeare: and for any common yeare with very little trouble, as I shall shewe in this manner: Wherefore if you will know what degree and minute the Sunne is in vpon any day and yeare assigned. First, seeke by the <HI>Zodiacke</HI> for the letter of the Moneth in which your day is (<HI>vz. For the let∣ter I seruing for Iune, which is placed at the</HI> 20 <HI>degree and somewhat more in</HI> ♊, <HI>and the number</HI> 6 <HI>ascribed thereto, signifieth</HI> 6 <HI>minutes more then the</HI> 20 <HI>degrees, the exact place of that letter I.</HI>) And from that letter <HI>(vz. I)</HI> number for∣wards so many degrees of the Clipticke as your day (<HI>the</HI> 8 <HI>of Iune</HI>) proposed is within your moneth <HI>(Iune)</HI> proposed, rebating so many minutes, according to the second obser∣uaunce before mentioned (<HI>vz. for your</HI> 8 <HI>dayes, recken</HI> 8 <HI>de∣grees in sequens of that</HI> 20 <HI>deg.</HI> 6 <HI>min. of</HI> ♊ <HI>lacking</HI> 8 <HI>min.</HI>) and where that accoumpt falleth out (<HI>which you shall finde vppon that reckning and rebating of</HI> 8 <HI>minutes, to be</HI> 27 <HI>de∣grees</HI> 58 <HI>minutes of</HI> ♊.) there shall be the true place of the ☉ if it be a Leape yeare (<HI>as this yeare</HI> 1596 <HI>is</HI>) and there (<HI>vz. at the saide</HI> 27 <HI>degrees</HI> 58 <HI>minutes of</HI> ♊) you may place the Carect of the Sunne for that day, as in the last Chapter is
<PB REF="12"/> taught. But if it shall be the first yeare after the Leape yeare, then shall you rebate a quarter of a degree, or 14 ⅓ min. (if you will be precise) if the second yeare, then rebate halfe a degree, if the third, rebate ¾ of a degree, and then euery Leape yeare it returneth to his owne place againe. And this for almost twenty yeares eyther before or behinde the <HI>Radi∣call</HI> yeare 1600 shall serue passing well and reddye within some foure or fiue minutes, but for any time after the yeare 1600 you shall neede but adde, and for any time before sub∣tract some halfe quarter of a Degree (or 8 ¾ minutes if you will be precise) for euery 20 yeares. (<HI>As for Example for the place of the</HI> ☉ <HI>the</HI> 8 <HI>day of March in the yeare</HI> 1700. <HI>be∣cause betweene the yeare</HI> 1600 <HI>and</HI> 1700, <HI>there are fiue times</HI> 20 <HI>yeares, therefore I adde fiue diquarters of a degree (or to be precise fiue times</HI> 8 ¾ <HI>minutes which maketh</HI> 44 ¾ <HI>minutes) vnto the foresaid</HI> 27 <HI>degr.</HI> 58 <HI>min. in</HI> ♊, <HI>and it maketh</HI> 28 <HI>de∣grees,</HI> 42 ¾ <HI>minutes, which is the true place of the</HI> ☉ <HI>on the</HI> 8 <HI>day of Iune, Anno.</HI> 1700.) And because you shall worke the more certaine, I haue to euery of the 12 letters of the mo∣neths, set the number of the minutes of that degree where his right place should be, which place is also descryed by a little stroke or string cutting the true place of the same Degree, and leading thence to the letter, if it be not placed directly therewith.</P>
<P>Also you must not forget for ages past or to come, to adde or subtract the <HI>Aequacion</HI> of the 8 Speere, as in the 30 Cap. shall be shewed according to the words <HI>Adiectiue</HI> or <HI>Abla∣tiue</HI> there mentioned, for that will from time to time alter this true place of the Sunne, euen vnto 1 ⅙ Degrees, about 800 yeares to come, or passed. Although some others haue ouerslipped in their Theoricks of the ☉ both this, and the third obseruacion before. (<HI>For example you shall by the</HI> 30 <HI>Cap. finde the</HI> 8 <HI>Speares Aequation</HI> 12 ¼ <HI>minutes ablatiue for the yeare</HI> 1700, <HI>and so will the true place then be but</HI> 28 <HI>de∣grees</HI> 30 ½ <HI>minutes for the</HI> 8 <HI>of Iune.</HI>)</P>
<PB REF="12"/>
<P>After many words thus spent, the precept is briefely thus: Suppose euery degree of the-clipticke to be a day of the yeare, rebating for euery day a minute, and for euery of the three common yeares 14 ⅓ minutes, and thus farre it serueth for all times. But now i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your time be after 1600, you must for the <HI>motus equalis compositus</HI> adde 8 ¾ degrees for euery 20 yeares, and for euery 20 yeare before 1650 adde 5 min. for the 8 spheeres equation: and contrariwise, if being before 1600 and after 1650 you must subduct as much. Note, that I haue been sithence enformed that our honourable Lords de∣parted the 3 of Iune, but let the 8 of Iune now stand for the example, nothing hurtfull.</P>

And the very like vnto those ought to haue been delineated, issuing from the Poles of the world, limitting the right assentions and declinations of the Starres, in regard of the Equinoctiall, and are commonly called Meridians and Paralells, which because the nature of this proiectement doth cast the Meridians into streight lines issuing from the Poles, both lodged in the Centre vnto euery of the 360 degrees of the Equinoctiall, or rather of the limbe and the parallells into concentricke circles, they are therefore supplyed by playing about the radiall degrees
<PB REF="14"/> of the noone-lines on the Centre, by the degrees of the limbe, and might as well be done by a thred &amp; pearle applyed to the radyall degrees of the Scale planted at the beginning of ♋.</P>

<P>Now therefore when you are to get the right ascension of any Planet-Starre, or point of the heauens assigned, you are but to learne what Meridian and Paralell cutteth the same, and if you do but lay the noone-line thereon, it sheweth you in the limbe the right ascention, and in the scale of the Radiall degrees on the noone-line the declinacion. For ex∣ample, the Sunnes <HI>Apex</HI> placed at the 26 degree 3 minut. of ♓ by the 2 cap. lay the noone-line thereto, and it shall shewe you in the limbe 356 degrees 25 minutes his right as∣cencion, and among the radiall degrees of the noone-line 1 degr. 30 min. his declinacion, and that Southwards of the Equinoctiall.

<P>For example, admit the first Starre of the tayle of <HI>Vrsa maior</HI> called <HI>Alioth,</HI> if you obserue his comming to the <HI>Me∣ridian</HI> aboue the Pole-Starre, and there finde his altitude to be 84 degrees high, and afterwards finding him againe in the <HI>Meridian</HI> vnder the Pole (which will be some 12 houres betweene) and there but 19 ⅓ degrees high, then take 19 ⅓ out of 84 there resteth 64 ⅔, halfe that being 32 ⅓ added to 19 ⅓ maketh 51 ⅔ our eleuacion heere at <HI>Reading,</HI> and so much is our Zenith, or Verticall point, all is one, distant from the Equinoctiall, and that 51 ⅔ taken out of 90, leaueth the complement 38 ⅓ the Equinoctials height aboue the Horizon in our Meridian.</P>

And I according to <HI>Copernicus</HI> cause the earth or Horizon to moue leftwards from West towards East, vppon the Starry Firmament fixed: In so much, that if in this my Astrolabe you hold still that perticular moouer with one hand, and with your vnder hand turne about the Celestiall, then is it iumpe <HI>Stophler</HI> againe. In which motion (a pretty thing to note) one that standeth by shall hardly perceiue any other but that the Reete mooueth, although in deede you turne a∣bout the Mater, strongly confirming <HI>Copernicus</HI> Argument, who sayth, that the weakenesse of our senses do imagine the Heauens to mooue about euery 24 houres from East to West by a <HI>Primum mobile,</HI> where as in deede they haue been alwayes fixed, and it is the earth that whirleth about euery 24 houres from West to East, of his owne propper nature allotted vnto him, as most fit for the receptacle of all tran∣sitory things, being appointed in a place where nothing is to stay him from his continuall moouing: but of those things I haue more iust occasion to intreate of in my <HI>Organum V∣ranicum</HI>

Yet is it more easily to be done by a perticular, whose radyall degrees on the North line, which before I haue tearmed North degrees, are or should be ready numbered from the Horizontall point, towards the Verticall point, ending there at 90 degrees, which in the generall can not be suffered. Wherefore kee∣ping the fiduciall line of the Almicantifer euen with the North line, then sliding the Cursor from roote to roote of the 90 rootes of your perticular Zenith line, set nickes in the Almicantifer at euery degree, from degree to degree of the 90 North degrees, numbered from the Horizontall point, towards the Verticall point, correspondent to each roote as they passe in order, till the whole 90 particular degrees be in manner as in the 13 Cap. is shewed by those nicks placed on the Almicantifer, and then distinguish them by tennes, and set numbers vnto them accordingly, so are they very ready for diuers speciall purposes in one latitude, and if neede were, a man may by the two edges on both faces set the like in for foure latitudes, and those will neere be suffi∣cient for any one region or prouince, or else he might haue it made with some chanell to receiue a slip of velome or paste-boorde, whereon with pen and inke speedily to pre∣pare it for any latitude.</P>

<HEAD>Cap. 26. ¶ Of the 4 Cardines, and the sundry rising and setting of the fixed Starres with the Planets.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Meridian and Horizon of euery place do alwayes crosse each other in halfe on the North and South points of the same Hori∣zon: which crossing, maketh of those two circles 4 semicircles, which are called the 4 <HI>Cardines.</HI> Vnto either of which when any
<PB REF="26"/> Planet commeth, especially if he be accompanyed or strongly aspected with some other forcible Planet, Starre, or constel∣lacion, he worketh speciall effects, whether it be in natiuities or other causes, especially at any such time, looke assuredly for some present alteracion of the weather in that Horizon, because there they do strongly affect and aspect the ascendent Horizon and Climat, either by coniunction, opposition, or quartile, which are the strongest: the other, as the △ and ✶, are counted of lesse force. And whosoeuer will take vpon him to iudge of Aspects or Eclipses, if he haue not an eye whether they aspect the Climat, or to iudge of the weather, and not specially regard the effects of the fixed Starres with the Planets, shall finde it to prooue but lost labour, and happily be counted a common lyar, as some of our vnskilfull Progno∣sticators are, and the rest little better thought of, because of their negligence or ignorance. But to come to my purpose a∣gaine, you shall vnderstand, that when any Starre riseth together with any Planet on the Horizon (if with the ☉, then is it called the <HI>Cosmicall rising</HI> and if setting at Sunne ri∣sing the <HI>Cosmicall setting,</HI> if rising the Sunne setting, the <HI>Acronicall rising,</HI> if setting with the ☉, the <HI>Acronicall set∣ting.</HI>) The Cosmicall rising is easily knowne by applying the Almicantifer prepared to the Horizon vnto any Planet in the East Hemicicle: there hold fast the Zenitfer, and play a∣bout the Almicantifer, and looke what Starres the pointer toucheth on in the East Hemicicle, be sure those do rise at the same time Cosmically with that Planet, and those he toucheth on in the West Hemicicle, do then Cosmically set with the same Planet, then rising. Likewise, if you put ouer the Almicantifer so prepared, causing the Planet to lye in the East Hemicicle, applying the pointer there∣to, and there holding fast the Zenitfer, do leade the Almi∣cantifer about, then be sure that such Starres as the poin∣ter lighteth on in the East Hemicicle, shall rise acronically with that Planet setting, and those in the West Hemicicle,
<PB REF="27"/> shall set acronically together with the Planet setting: and what time of the yeare any of these shall happen, is easily con∣ceiued by that hath been said in the last Cap. and elsewhere: For vnto the Starre proposed, if you apply the pointer prepa∣red to the Horizon, &amp; there holding the Zenithfer, do remooue the Almicantifer till the pointer touch or cut the Clipticke either in the East or West Hemicicle. Then by the <HI>Ephe∣mer.</HI> or my <HI>Vranicum</HI> you may easily know when &amp; what day any Planet shal come vnto those points of the-cliptick so cut, and the degree of the ☉ for that day also labelled, sheweth there in the houre-circle the houre of the day (the Zenitfer be∣ing neuer stirred all the while) when any such rising or set∣ting shall happen.</P>
<P>For example, this yeare 1596 some 5 or 6 dayes together before the end of September, after long sitting all day wri∣ting this present booke, I was in the euenings hindred of my recreating walks by sodaine rising of the winde with showres of raine, though the dayes were reasonable faire, I therefore sought this my new Astrolabe, and found the <HI>Pleiades</HI> or 7 Starres to rise in the euenings cosmically with <HI>Iupiter,</HI> being retrograde all the while, ♀ also being then retrograde, for re∣trogradacion causeth rayne, especially in ☿ without all fayle more or lesse as he shall be affected or aspected. Also the 2 of October 1596 I was sodeinly ouertaken riding from <HI>Rea∣ding</HI> to my poore house at <HI>Swallowfeild</HI> at euen, with a most stormy rayne that continued an houre or two after very ex∣treame, it made me looke my Astrolabe againe, where I found <HI>spica virguis</HI> the Sunne ♂ and ☿ had set all together acroni∣cally within one halfe houre or lesse that this storme began, and then an houre after that <HI>Iupiter</HI> was to rise as before cos∣mically with the <HI>Pleyades.</HI> Now I leaue it to our sufficient Prognosticators to iudge whether these might be efficient causes sufficient or no, and do commend this my Astrolabe vnto them as a most needfull thing for them, wishing them to haue a speciall regard of the rising, setting, and culminating
<PB REF="27"/> of the fixed Starres. The common countreyman seeing any day inclined to moysture, can say, that it will surely rayne when the Sunne and the winde come together, neither will it indeede rayne till then for the most part, how likely so euer. And wherefore then should not we beleeue the learned, that affirme the rising of <HI>Orion, Arcturus, Corona, &amp;c.</HI> to prouoke tempestious weather, the Kid and Goate windes, the <HI>Hiades, Pleiades</HI> and <HI>Succule</HI> rayne, and especially happening with any forcible Planet or strong aspect, the more violent. Were it not for consuming the time, I could recite examples of all these and diuers other that I haue vpon like occasions noted to my selfe, but dare presume no further, least I should be billed amongst the common liers, as others are happily cause∣lesse: for no doubt the Almighty hath the raigne in his hand, to alter all at his pleasure when they haue all done their best. Yet that which is most to be condemned in them is, that they agree seldome in one coniecture, which must needes bewray shamefull ignorance in some of them at the least.</P>

Also I am to note vnto you, that there are two things that fall out vn∣luckily in this practise, which you shall thus salue. The first is, that the breadth of the Zenitfer hideth from the pointer the Horizon point set at the Apex in the East Hemicicle. This is salued two wayes: the one is, when the Almicantifer is pre∣pared to set the Cursor at so many degrees of the North line.
<PB REF="29"/> as he is at in the Noone line, and so will the East and West points of the houre-circle change their places for the time: The other way generall to all foure remooues of the Zenith∣fer. For so soone as you had gotten the 4 Cardines, if you had made in the Celestialls limbe on each side of the noone-line two markes, the one 30 the other 60 degrees distant from it, that shall serue as well and in stead of the foure times, applying of the pointer to the Horizon point before vsed, as if you trye both wayes you shall finde, and produce one truth.</P>
<P>And whereas for diuers latitudes, some of the domifying rootes do go out of the Zenitfer, those may easily be supplyed with help of a threed and pearle added to the pointer, or with helpe of a paire of compasses thus: First, cast away 45 out of your radiall number shewed by the slope line (<HI>vz. out of the</HI> 57 ⅔ <HI>casting</HI> 45, <HI>there remaineth</HI> 12 ⅔) and set y<SUP>e</SUP> Cursor vnto twise so many of the domifying rootes of the noonelines scale as the remaine commeth vnto, (<HI>vz. vnto the</HI> 25 ⅔ <HI>domifying roote</HI>) and there apply the pointer vnto the like number of the domifying radiall degrees of the North line (<HI>vz. vnto</HI> 25 ⅓ <HI>degr. reckoned on the North line from the equinoctials inter∣section towards the centre</HI>) and then the Cursor remayning, do apply the fiduciall line of the Almicantifer euen with the fiduciall noone-line of y<SUP>e</SUP> Zenitfer outwards, there doth y<SUP>e</SUP> poin∣ters Apex shew y<SUP>e</SUP> true place of y<SUP>e</SUP> roote wanting, where if you pitch one foote of your compasse, or fasten a threed, and with the other or with the pearle extended to the domifying ra∣dyall degree of the slope line, (<HI>vz. vnto the</HI> 57 ⅔ <HI>radiall domi∣fying degree,</HI>) offer to describe a circle, it shall cut the-clip∣ticke as before the pointer did at 22 degrees of ♓ and of ♍, so the noone-line stand at his due place as before, <HI>vz.</HI> at 30 or 60 degrees of the Celestialls limbe from the first consti∣tution.</P>

Therefore I haue within the Radicall table placed an instrument of my deuise to equate the same, which consisteth (as the Radicall table doth) of two partes, the one for the ablatiue <HI>Aequations,</HI> the other for the <HI>Adiectiue,</HI> each part hauing two limbes ioyning together, the outermost carrying the sayd 71 minutes two wayes for the ballaicing too and fro: the innermost being double, in which are written the yeares from Christes birth for 3440 yeares after, numbered from the ✿ twise about, for that in so many yeares the <HI>Ano∣malye</HI> of this ballaicings compleateth twise, &amp; therefore that inner limbe is double. Wherefore if now you would knowe this <HI>Aequacion</HI> for any yeare (<HI>admit the yeare</HI> 2000) seeke the same yeare 2000 in that double limbe, &amp; you shall finde in the outer limbe the minutes of equation that answere thereunto <HI>(vz. almost</HI> 70 <HI>min. ablatiue)</HI> to be added or subducted too or from the equall motion before gotten according as the words <HI>Adiectiuae</HI> or <HI>Ablatiuae</HI> do admonish. <HI>(vz. whereas the equall motion of the fixed Starres was before found for the yeare af∣ter Christ</HI> 2000 <HI>compleate to be gone forwards</HI> 4 <HI>deg.</HI> 53 <HI>mi. you must now pull out</HI> 70 <HI>minutes, so will there be left</HI> 3 <HI>deg.</HI> 43 <HI>min. their true motion in that</HI> 530 <HI>yeares, according to

<HEAD>Cap. 31. ¶ How by help of this Astrolabe to get the longi∣tude and latitude of any Planet, yea, or of any Starre or Comet seene.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>Auing a Meridian exactly set as in the 9 Cap. is taught, you shall obserue the comming of any Planet, Starre, or Comet to the Meridian either in the South or North partes, <HI>(as for example the</HI> 2 <HI>of October</HI> 1596 <HI>I obserued the comming of ♃ to our Meridian heere at Reading)</HI> and there take his meridian altitude <HI>(which I found</HI> 50 ½ <HI>deg.)</HI> as is taught in the 11 Cap. and presently (except you haue some clocke or watch truly set) get the houre and minute if you can by taking the altitude of some knowne Starre, as in the 13 Cap. is taught, <HI>(I found it a quarter of an houre past one and better after midnight)</HI> which done, seeke that houre and minute in the houre circle, and labell it to the ☉ planted by the 4 Cap. (<HI>at</HI> 20 <HI>de.</HI> 10 <HI>min. of</HI> ♎) &amp; there hold fast the Zenitfer, &amp; number the verticall distance or complement of the Merid. alti. before-taken <HI>(vz.</HI> 39 ½ <HI>de.)</HI> on y<SUP>e</SUP> nooneline frō y<SUP>e</SUP> Zenith point towards <HI>Meridies,</HI> if your Merid. alti. taken were South, or towards
<PB REF="33"/> <HI>Media nox,</HI> if North, (<HI>which heere being South, will fall out at the</HI> 12 ¼ <HI>radiall degree numbered from the Aequinoctiall</HI>) where make a pricke on the Celestiall, for there shall be the true point or place of the (♃) Starre, Planet, or Comet, ob∣serued for that instant, and the circles of the-clipticks longi∣tude and latitude cutting that point, shall shew you his longi∣tude and latitude sought (<HI>vz. the circle of longitude passing by that verticall distance or pricke made, shewed me in the clipticke</HI> 8 <HI>degrees</HI> 30 <HI>minutes almost of</HI> ♉, <HI>the longitude of</HI> ♃, <HI>and the circle of latitude cutting that pricke, shewed me almost</HI> 2 <HI>degrees Southwards from the-clipticke his latitude.</HI>) And this serueth for the ☽, or any Planet, Starre, or Comet seene. And now by helpe of this latitude thus gotten, you may as easily get the true places of the Starres seene in any other place as well as in the Meridian perpetually, for that their latitudes neuer alter, and of ♄, ♃, or ♂, 20 or 30 dayes af∣ter: for that theirs altereth little in that time, and of ♀ for a day or two after, but not for the ☽, because her latitude chan∣geth swiftly, neither for ☿, because in our Clymat we neuer see him: In this maner.</P>
<P>Take the altitude of any Starre, Planet, or Comet, whose latitude is foreknowne either by this Cap. or otherwise at any houre and minute knowne, taking good heede whether he be in the East or West Hemispheare. Then prepare the Zenitfer to that altitude taken, then labell the houre and minute to the ☉, and there hold fast the Zenitfer. Which done, apply the pointer to the circle of latitude of the Starre or Planet either in the East or West Hemicicle, according as the Starre or Planet was at taking his altitude, so shall the circle of longitude passing by the pointer so applyed, shew the longitude of the Starre or Planet in the-clipticke.</P>
<P>Note, that <HI>Io. Stophlerus lib.</HI> 2. <HI>prop.</HI> 38. reciteth 7 propo∣sitions which some lying Astronomers (as he tearmeth them) haue taken vpon them to teach on the Astrolabe, which he there condemneth to be most false, and not possible, and there∣fore
<PB REF="33"/> spendeth a Chapter to forewarne euery man to take heede and not to meddle with them. And these are the 7, the first, to knowe the longitude of the ☽, the second, the longi∣tude of ♄, ♃, ♂, ♀, or ☿, the third, to get their latitudes, the fourth, to know whether a Planet be direct or retrograde, the fift, to know the longitude of any Starre in the Reete, the sixt, the latitude of fixed Starres, the seuenth, the longi∣tude of Starres not in the Reete. And now I am to rewarne all men, that they are all possible by this Astrolabe, and by my Iewell also, and the whole 7 sauing the 4, are performed by this one Chapter: because I would not haue them now daunted with that 38 <HI>propos.</HI> of <HI>Stophler</HI> who meant it no doubt only, by that Astrolabe whereof himselfe wrote.</P>

<HEAD>Cap. 32. ¶ A ready way by helpe of this Astrolabe, heereafter to obserue the motions of Comets.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Ecause I haue seene some 4 or fiue yeares past a booke entituled <HI>Noua theoria Cometarum</HI> as I remem∣ber, set foorth by one <HI>Reslyn,</HI> who taking occasion vppon that great Comet or Blazing-Starre, which <HI>Anno</HI> 1570 was seene so long in the Constellation of <HI>Cassiopeia,</HI> in a manner fixed without motion, to imagining therefore that Comet to happen in the very Pole of the <HI>Theoricke,</HI> and that to be the cause why he mooued not, thereupon runneth on a course, with recitall of diuers Co∣mets and their motions, but concluded no certaintie to my remembrance, ending his booke with this saying, <HI>Est quo∣dam prodire tenus si non datur vltra.</HI> But our late learned
<PB REF="34"/> countreyman, Mayster <HI>Digges,</HI> in his <HI>Scala Mathematica</HI> found, because he had no Parallax, that he must needes be beyond the Speere of the ☽. Well no doubt there can not any weighty thing come to perfection at the first, second, or third assay, and therefore to the end it may be a generall care to obserue the motions of Comets when they happen, I haue thought good to aduertise euery man in this Cap. that either on this Astrolabe or on the Globe, it is a most easy matter when any Planet appeareth, to pricke downe his place euen by the very view of his scituation among the fixed Starres, seeing by the 25 Cap. before you may so easily learne to know them all.</P>
<P>As for example in Iuly this yeare 1596 there appeared a Comet with a streaming tayle vpwards in the North-west, which vpon Tewsday the 20 of Iuly aforesayd, about 9 of the clocke at night, I first tooke heede of betweene the two hin∣der legs of <HI>Vrsa maior</HI> almost in a streight line, (but some∣what lower, and two parts of the way) between the Starre of the fourth light in the neere hocke of the neere hinder legge, and the two Starres of the third light in the further foote behinde, according whereunto I made a pricke in the Celestiall of this Astrolabe. The 21 of Iuly the same houre, I sawe him directly in the streight line aforesayde, and distant from the sayd two Starres twise their distance. The 22 day the same houre I sawe him a little aboue the streight line, and but their distance off. The 23 of Iuly the night was darke. The 24 of Iuly I sawe him aboue those two Starres of the third light, and to make an equilater triangle with them: all which, I noted downe euery night with pricks, then followed a fewe clowdy and darke nights, and after that 24 day he was no more seene. This Comet was seene of many others some fortnight before I sawe him, as neere as I could gesse by their relacion euen about the brisket of <HI>Vrsa maior,</HI> a little behinde the hocke of the neere legge afore, which also I pricked downe: and haue caused
<PB REF="34"/> those pricks and the trayle of his gate to be grauen in the Celestiall, in the Constellacion of <HI>Vrsa maior</HI> if you marke it, (though not done fully to my purpose) to the end to incite others heereafter to do the like, that posterity at the last may finde out whether there be any regularity in their motions. If the Comet chaunce to come to the Meridian either in the North or South (as this did not in sight) then by the last Cap. you may get his longitude &amp; latitude euery night, and so pricke downe euery dayes motion the more exactly.</P>
