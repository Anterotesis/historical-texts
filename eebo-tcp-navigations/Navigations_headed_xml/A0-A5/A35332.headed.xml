<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THough occasion has not hitherto per∣mitted me to write to you all this time, yet I hope this will not be unwelcome to such a well-wisher of their Majesties and Countreys Interest as your self. We just now Arrived here safe from <HI>Dublin</HI> Bay, whither our Comman∣der Captain <HI>John Jennings</HI> was ordered out last Week, taking Their Majesties Ship the <HI>Dover,</HI> Captain <HI>Whitaker</HI> Commander a∣long for our Assistance: we Arrived at <HI>Dub∣lin</HI> Bay about 11 at Night on <HI>Friday</HI> last, and came to an Anchor, sent our Boats to and a∣gain over the Bay all that Night and to Mor∣row after, and did take several little Vessels with Prisoners, and Protestants, by whom we were too late informed that four Vessels went richly loaded for <HI>France</HI> some five or six hours before we Arrived; but our com∣fort is that the <HI>Ruby</HI> and <HI>James</HI> Galley being sent before us to Cruise over against <HI>Water∣ford</HI> and <HI>Saltess,</HI> can hardly be supposed to miss of them. Our taking of so many of their Barks and Vessels did so vex the <HI>Irish</HI> that they planted abundance of Great Guns upon one side of the Bay, and play'd very smartly upon us all <HI>Saturday</HI> Morning, which our Men were so unconcerned at, that while their Great Shot came very thick about us on all sides, yet all we returned them for some time were some few Hollows of deri∣sion after every Volley of the <HI>Irish</HI> Guns. But at length our Commander orders to weigh Anchor, and coming some nearer to them, returned them so hot Broad-sides that though all the place was full of Men, and convenience to keep our Shot from doing them much hurt, yet of a truth it was plea∣sant to see with what pannick fear and con∣fusion they run every one almost a different way, in all the World like a company of Mice pursued by Rats, industriously making tryal of every appearance of a hiding place. The Horses run as confusedly and disorderly as the Men, and being madded with noise and disorder, trod down numbers of them, for though there were a great number of Horse∣men (for they feared our coming ashore) yet in a little time not a Man was to be seen on Horseback save the late King <HI>James</HI> en∣deavouring to put courage in that Spiritless Crew; but all he could do was with great difficulty to get their Guns carried off, and was forced to quit his Horse; upon which our Commander ordered the Boats ashore, and going himself in Person, took a little Vessel in the eye of several Troops of <HI>Dra∣goons</HI> that had come fresh from <HI>Dublin,</HI> with whom, as we understood after, the late King <HI>James</HI> returned; but so soon as our Commander ordered the two Boats
<PB REF="2"/>Crews ashore, it was pleasant to see how such as were on Horseback did Scamper, and such as were on Foot did climb upon the Rocks like so many Goats. In fine, it not being safe for so small a Number as our Boats Crews to advance far, our Comman∣der was contented to bring some of their Horses on Board of our Ship by the little Vessel he had taken in their eye, for a token of their Cowardize, and the English Cou∣rage, amongst which was the late King <HI>James</HI>'s own Horse, which he had quit, it seems, to order and encourage the Dragoons that were on foot. We brought four of the Horses, and specially that which was the late King <HI>James</HI>'s to <HI>High-lake,</HI> and set them on Shore. In all the Action, though they lost several, as we could visibly see, and Prisoners after taken confirmed, yet we lost not one Man, though yet there wanted not work for your <HI>Instruments,</HI> which answered my expectation pretty well. There lay a Pri∣vateer within the Bar, which we are infor∣med does carry Weekly Pacquets to and from some place of <HI>England,</HI> which we could not come at, our Boats being of too small Force to attack him, and our Ships of too great Burthen to go over the Bar; beside, that we was not allowed so much time by our Orders as to Man and Fit one or two of the Barks we took to attack him, else our Commander had certainly brought him a∣long. The Protestants and Prisoners tell us, That all things are so scarce at <HI>Dublin,</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> are like to eat up the <HI>Irish,</HI> and they irritated to see the <HI>French</HI> pre∣ferred and countenanced, severals specially of the <HI>Irish</HI> are daily killed upon the Score. They expected we were to lye in the Bay to hinder them from any commerce by Sea with <HI>France</HI> or other parts of <HI>Ireland,</HI> which terrified, and as the Protestants assure us, would weaken them exceedingly, and make them quit <HI>Dublin.</HI> 'Tis commonly judged by Papists as well as Protestants at <HI>Dublin,</HI> that King <HI>James</HI> has a mind to sub∣mit to our King; First, Because he is no∣thing so much cast down, sometime since he heard of King <HI>William</HI>'s Design of com∣ing to <HI>Ireland;</HI> and of his little concern how things go with his Army. Others judge that he makes his account to quit <HI>Ireland</HI> at last, because he is so earnest in sending off for <HI>France</HI> all the Best things he can, and those also that are near∣est to him, in these four Ships I spoke of; they tell us of a vast deal of Plate, Gold, and Silver Money, beside other fine Things; so that hardly any Money but their new Coin is to be seen among them. We brought off a great deal of their Coin at this and other Occasions, whereof I would have sent you a Token, if wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h the pains. Our Army, as the Prisoners tell us, have taken <HI>Droghedah,</HI> and make haste towards <HI>Dublin.</HI> All the Prisoners profess themselves willing and glad to be Taken from the Misery that they feared to come upon them. By which you may judge what may be expected if our King were once over. So soon as he goes o∣ver, our Ship, with the <HI>Monk</HI> and St. <HI>Al∣bans</HI> are order'd to attend the great Fleet, whence I may have Occasion to send to you for some <HI>Instruments,</HI> and my Friends Mr. <HI>Hulse</HI> and Mr. <HI>Thowlt,</HI> for some <HI>Me∣dicines;</HI> for our Captain has spoken to me to provide for a bigger Ship. I shall only desire you to Present my most hearty Respects to my very good Friends Mr. <HI>Hargrave,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Couley,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hulse,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Thowlt;</HI> and to please, if you can hear of us, to write me how they be, and your self; as also how things Rule, especially in <HI>Scotland.</HI> Our Crui∣sers have been so vigilant, that it is great News to hear of a <HI>French</HI> Ship a∣ny where in this Channel. I could write you many more considerable things, but that I forbear to trouble you too much at one time, being,</P>
