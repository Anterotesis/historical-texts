<PB REF="3"/> upon <HI>this</HI> account only, an Unmeet subject for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> praises of the obscure pen which now writes, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Quis Vituperat?</HI> I do not, I dare not, so far In∣trude upon Your Honour, as to ask Your <HI>Patro∣nage</HI> unto all the <HI>New-English</HI> Principles &amp; Pra∣ctices, which are found in the Character of our Celebrated <HI>ELIOT;</HI> for; as the Distance of a Thousand Leagues, ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> made it impossible for me to attend the <HI>(usual)</HI> Orders and Manners of asking first Your Allowance for what I have openly Entitled you unto; so, the Renowned <HI>ELIOT</HI> is gone beyond any occasions for the greatest Humane <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ronage.</HI></P>
<P>But that which has procured unto Your Lordship, the Trouble of this <HI>Dedication,</HI> is, My Desire to Give You the Picture of One <HI>Aged</HI> Saint, Lately gone to that <HI>General Assem∣bly,</HI> which the Eternal King of Heaven, by the Advances of Your Own <HI>Age in the way of Righteousness</HI> does quickly Summon Your Self unto The Profound Respect which Our ELIOT had for Your Honour, will doub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>less be an∣swered and requited with Your own Value for the Memory of such a memorable <HI>Christian, Ministe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and <HI>Evangelist;</HI> inasmuch as, <HI>Your</HI> Affections like <HI>his,</HI> take not their Measures from these or those matters of <HI>Doub f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Dispu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atum,</HI> but from such an universal <HI>Pie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> and <HI>Charity,</HI> and Holiness, as <HI>he</HI> was an Instance of.</P>
<P>No man ever complained of it that in the works of <HI>Chrysostom,</HI> we find <HI>seven</HI> Orations no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB REF="3"/> for asunder, in Commendation of <HI>Paul:</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> it any fault that I have now written <HI>One,</HI> in Com∣mendation of a man whom a <HI>Pauline</HI> Spirit, had made Illustrious. In describing him, I have made but little Touches upon his Parentage, and Family, because as the truly Great <HI>Basil</HI> excuses his Omission of those things, in his Oration upon <HI>Gordius</HI> the <HI>Martyr, Ecclesia haec tanquam super∣vacaa dimittit.</HI> But I have related those things of him, which cannot but create a good Esteem for him, in the Breast of your Lordship, who are a Faithful and Ancient <HI>Witness</HI> against those Distempers of the world, whereby (as the blessed <HI>Sal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ian</HI> Lamented it) <HI>Cogimur esse Viles ut Nobiles habeamur;</HI> and Raise the sweetness of Your Thoughts upon Your Approaches, which may our God make both <HI>slow</HI> and <HI>sure,</HI> unto that State, wherein, <HI>The Least is Greater than this</HI> JOHN.

<P>My Lord, In one ELIOT, You see what a <HI>People</HI> 'tis, that You have counted worthy of Your Notice; and what a <HI>People</HI> 'tis, that with a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dent Prayers bespeak the Mercies of Heaven
<PB REF="4" MS="y"/> for Your Noble Family. Indeed, It is Impo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦sible that a country So full as <HI>New-England</HI> is, of what is truly <HI>Primitive,</HI> should not be ex∣posed unto the bitterest Enmity and Calumny of those, that will strive to entangle the Church in a <HI>Sardian</HI> Unreformedness, until our Jesus do shortly <HI>Make them know, that He has loved,</HI> what they have hated, maligned, persecuted. But if the God of <HI>New-England</HI> have inclined any <HI>Great Personage,</HI> to Intercede or Interpose for the prevention of the <HI>Ruines</HI> which ill men have designed for such Country; or to procure for a a People of an <HI>Eliot</HI>'s Complexion in Religi∣on, the Undisturbed Enjoyment and Exercise of <HI>that</HI> Religion: it is a thing that calls for our most sensible Acknowledgments.</P>
<P>It is an odd <HI>Superstition</HI> which the <HI>Indians</HI> of this countrey have among them, that they count it (on the penalty of otherwise <HI>never prospering</HI> more) necessary for them, never to pass by the <HI>Graves</HI> of certain famous persons a∣mong them, without laying and leaving some Token of Regard thereupon. But we hope that all true <HI>Protestants,</HI> will count it no more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what is <HI>equal</HI> and <HI>proper,</HI> that the Land which has in it, the <HI>Grave</HI> of such a Remarkable Preacher to the <HI>Indians</HI> as our ELIOT, should be treated with such a <HI>Love,</HI> as a <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> u∣ses to find from them that are to <HI>prosper.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Introduction.</HEAD>
<P>'TWas a very surprising as well as an undoubted Accident which happen∣ed within the memory of Millions yet alive, when certain Shepherds upon Mount <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bo,</HI> following part of their straggling Flock, at length came to a <HI>Valley,</HI> the prodigious Depths and Rocks whereof rendred it almost inaccessi∣ble; in which there was a <HI>Cave</HI> of inexpressible sweetness, and in that Cave was a <HI>Sepul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> that had very difficult Char<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cters upon it. The Patriarchs of the <HI>Maronites</HI> thereabouts inha∣b ting, procured some learned Persons to take Notice, and make Report of this Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iosity, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>und the Inscription of the Grave-stone to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Hebrew Language and Letter, <HI>Moses, the Servant of the Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,</HI> The <HI>Jews,</HI> the <HI>Greeks,</HI> &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> thereabouts, were all to∣gether by the ears for the possessi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of this Ra∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity, but the <HI>Lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> as quickly said Claim unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, and strongly guarded it. Nevertheless, the

The <HI>Age</HI> with the <HI>Death</HI> of this worthy man, has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een already terminated, in the Ninetieth year <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the present Century, and the Eighty sixth
<PB N="6" REF="8"/> Year of his own Pilgrimage. And for his <HI>Birth</HI> it was at a Town, in <HI>England;</HI> the Nam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whereof I cannot presently Recover; nor is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> necessary for me to look back so far as the pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of his <HI>Nativity;</HI> any more than 'tis for me t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> recite the Vertues of his <HI>Parentage,</HI> of which h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> said, <HI>vix ea nostra voco.</HI> The <HI>Atlantick Ocea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> like a River of <HI>Lethe,</HI> may easily cause us t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> forget many of the things that happened o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the other side.

<P>He came to <HI>New-England,</HI> in the Month of <HI>November. A.

<P>'Twere impossible to finish the <HI>lively</HI> Picture of this pious and holy <HI>Eliot,</HI> without some touches upon that <HI>Mortification,</HI> which accompa∣ny'd him all his days; for never did I see a person more <HI>mortify'd</HI> unto all the pleasures of this Life, or more unwilling to <HI>moult</HI> the wing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of an Heaven-born Soul, in the dirty puddles of carnal and sensual Delights.

<PB N="38" REF="24"/> and bereaved him of those Gifts &amp; Parts which once he had been Accomplished with, being asked, <HI>How he did?</HI> he would some∣times answer, <HI>Alas, I have lost every thing; my Ʋnderstanding leaves me, my Memory fails me, my Ʋtterance fails me; but I thank God, my Charity holds out still; I find</HI> that <HI>rather grows than fails!</HI> And I make no question, That at his Death, his happy Soul was Received, and welcomed, into the <HI>everlasting Habitations,</HI> by many scores got thither before him, of such as his <HI>Charity</HI> had been liberal unto.</P>
<P>But besides these more <HI>Substantial Expressions</HI> of his <HI>Charity,</HI> hee made the Odours of that <HI>Grace</HI> yet more fragrant unto all that were about him, by that <HI>Pittifulness</HI> and that <HI>Peaceableness,</HI> which rendred him yet further Amiable. If any of his Neighbourhood were in distress, he was like a <HI>Brother born for their Adversity;</HI> he would visit them, and comfort them, with a most Fra∣ternal <HI>Sympathy;</HI> yea, 'tis not easiy to recount how many whole dayes of <HI>Prayer with Fasting</HI> he has got his Neighbours to keep with him, on the behalf of those whose Calamities he found himself touched withal. It was an extreme Sa∣tisfaction to him, that his Wife had attained un∣to a considerable skill in <HI>Physick</HI> and <HI>Chyrurgery,</HI> which enabled her to dispense many safe, good, and useful Medicines, unto the <HI>Poor</HI> that had oc∣casion for them; and some hundreds of sick &amp; weak and maimed people owed praises to God,
<PB N="39" REF="24"/> for the Benefit which therein they freely recei∣ved of her. The good Gentleman, her Hus∣band would still be casting <HI>Oyl</HI> into the <HI>Flame</HI> of that Charity, wherein she was of her own accord abundantly forward thus to be <HI>doing of good unto all;</HI> and he would urge her to be serviceable unto the worst <HI>Enemies</HI> that he had in the world. Never had any man fewer Enemies than he! But once having delivered something in his Mi∣nistry, which displeased one of his Hearers, the man d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d passionately abuse him for it, and this both with <HI>Speeches</HI> and with <HI>Writings</HI> that revi∣led him. Yet it happening not long after, that this man gave himself a very dangerous <HI>Wound,</HI> Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI> immediately sends his Wife to cure him; who did accordingly. When the man was well he came to thank her; but she took no Rewards; and this <HI>Good man</HI> made him stay and <HI>eat</HI> with him, taking no notice of all the Ca∣lumnies with which he had loaded him; but by this Carriage he strangely mollifyed and conque∣red the <HI>Stomach</HI> of his Reviler.</P>
<P>He was also a great Enemy to all <HI>Contention,</HI> &amp; would ring a loud <HI>Courseu-Bell</HI> wherever he saw the <HI>Fires</HI> of Animosity. When he heard any Ministers complain, that such and such in their Flocks, were too <HI>difficult</HI> for them, the strain of his Answer still was, <HI>Brother, Compass them!</HI> and <HI>Brother, Learn the meaning of those three little Words, Bear, Forbear, Forgive.</HI> Yea, his In∣clinations for <HI>Peace,</HI> indeed sometimes almost

<P>Finally, 'twas his <HI>Charity</HI> which disposed him

<P>It is to be confessed, That the written Word of God, is to be regarded as the perfect and

The poor Captived Gen∣tleman quickly Returns to us that had been mourning for him as a lost man, and brings us News, that the Prince which had hitherto held him was come to an <HI>untimely Death,</HI> by which means he was now set at Liberty.

<P>One thing whereof he was very desirous for

<PB N="57" REF="33"/> do at the same time confess the <HI>Divine Right</HI> of <HI>Infants</HI> in it.

<P>Wherefore, when there was brought among us a Book of pious Mr. <HI>Norcot</HI>'s, whereby some became Disposed to, or Confirmed in, a preju∣dice against <HI>Paedo-Baptism,</HI> it was not long be∣fore Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI> published a little Answer there∣unto; the first lines whereof presently discover what a Temper he writ it with; says he, <HI>The Book speaks with the voice of a Lamb, and I think the Author is a Godly, though Erring Broth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 chunk" DISP="…"/> but he acts the cause of a Roaring Lion, who by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> crafty ways, seeketh to devour the poor Lambs of the Flock of Christ.</HI> And so he goes on to plead the cause of them that <HI>cannot speak for them∣selves.</HI> No man could entertain a person of a different perswasion from himself, with more sweetness and kindness, than <HI>he,</HI> when he saw, <HI>Aliquid Christi,</HI> or the Fear of God prevailing in them; he could uphold a most intimate Cor∣respondence with such a man, as Mr. <HI>Jessey,</HI> as long as he lived; and yet he knew how to be an <HI>Hammer</HI> upon their unhappy Errors.</P>
<P>But having once <HI>Baptised</HI> the Children of his Covenanting Neighbours, he did not as too ma∣ny Ministers do, think, that he had now done with them. No, another thing wherein he was very laborious for poor <HI>Children</HI> was, the <HI>Cate∣chising</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="34"/> of them; he kept the great Ordinance of <HI>Catechising,</HI> both publickly &amp; privately, &amp; spent a world of time, about the end of the <HI>Second Century,</HI> before there had in the least begun to Start up <HI>New Officers</HI> in the Church of God; we and there were persons called unto the Office of <HI>Publick Teaching,</HI> who were not Pastors, not Ru∣lers, not called unto the Administration of o∣ther Ordinances; <HI>those</HI> in the Church of <HI>Alexa∣andria,</HI> were of a special Remark and Renown for their Abilities this way; and their Employ∣ment was to <HI>Explain</HI> and to <HI>Defend</HI> the princi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of the Christian Religion, unto all with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om they could be concerned. Here was the <HI>Catechist,</HI> with reference unto whom the Apostle says, <HI>Let the Catechised communicate unto him in all good things.</HI> Now, tho' some think, a <HI>Teach∣er</HI> purely as such, hath no Right unto further Church Administrations, any more than the <HI>Rabby</HI>'s or <HI>Doctors</HI> among the Jews, had to <HI>Of∣fer Sacrifices in the Temple;</HI> yet he who is called to be a <HI>Tea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her,</HI> may at the same time also be called to be an <HI>Elder,</HI> and being now a <HI>Teaching Elder,</HI> he becomes interested in the whole Go∣vernment of the Church, he has the power of all Sacred Administrations.

<P>There is a third instance of his Regards to the welfare of the poor <HI>Children</HI> under his charge; and that is, his perpetual Resolution and Activity to support a good <HI>School</HI> in the Town that belong'd unto him.

That every Member of this Assembly may go home and procure a good School to be encouraged in the Town where he lives! that before we dy, we may be so happy as to see a good School encouraged in every Plantation of the Country.</HI> God so blessed his Endeavours, that <HI>Roxbury</HI> could not live quietly without a <HI>Free School</HI> in the Town; and the issue of it has bin one thing, which has made me almost put the

<P>It afflicted him to see <HI>these,</HI> and more such as <HI>these,</HI> things continued in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> by the Artifice of certain persons who were loth to have the Refomation carried on unto those further Degrees which the most eminent of the <HI>first Reformers</HI> had in their Holy Designs; and it fill'd him with a just Horrour, and sorrow! to see above twenty Hundred faithful Ministers in one <HI>Black Day</HI> turned out of their employ∣ments, and several Thousands of Christians and Families in a little while Ruined, because they could not swallow down such unaccountable <HI>superstitions.</HI></P>
<P>We see what <HI>was not</HI> his opinion! but let us hear,
<PB N="65" REF="37"/> what it was. It was <HI>his</HI> as well as his master, the great <HI>Ramus</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s principle, <HI>that in the Reformati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of Churches to be now endeavoured things ought to be Reduced unto the Order wherein we find them at t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eir Primitive, Original, Apostolical Institution.</HI> And in pursuance of this principle, he Justly Espou∣sed that way of <HI>Church-Government</HI> which we call, <HI>the Congregational;</HI> he was fully perswaded, that the <HI>Church-state</HI> which our Lord Christ hath instituted in the New Testament, is, <HI>In a Congregation or Society of Professed Believers, A∣greeing and Assembling together, among themselves, with Officers, of Divine Appointment, for the Cele∣bration of Evangelical Ordinances, and their own mutual Edification;</HI> For he saw it must be a <HI>cru∣el hardship</HI> used upon the Scriptures, to make them so much as Lisp the least intimation of any other <HI>Church-state</HI> prescrib d unto us; and he could assert, <HI>That no Approved Writers, for the space of two hundred years after Christ, make any mention of any other Organical, V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sible, Pro∣fessing Church, but that onely which is Congrega∣tional.</HI> He look'd upon the <HI>Congregational way</HI> as a Largess of Divine Bounty bestow'd by the Lord Jesus, on his people, that follow'd him into this Wilderness, with a peculiar zeal for Communion with him, in his pure Worship here. He perceived in it, a sweet sort of <HI>Tem∣perament,</HI> between <HI>Rigid Presbyterianism,</HI> and <HI>Levelling Brownism;</HI> So that on the one side, the <HI>Liberties</HI> of the people are not oppressed and
<PB N="66" REF="38"/> overlaid; on the other side, the <HI>Authority</HI> of the Elders is not rendred insignificant, but a d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie <HI>Ballance</HI> is herein kept upon them both; And hence he closed with our <HI>platform of Church-Discipline,</HI> as being the nearest of what he had yet seen, to the <HI>pattern in the Mount.</HI></P>
<P>He could not comprehend, that this <HI>Church-state</HI> can arise from any other <HI>Formal cause,</HI> But the Consent, Conc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrence, Confederation of those concerned in it; he looked upon a Re∣lation unto a Church, as not a <HI>Natural,</HI> or a <HI>Vi∣olent,</HI> but a <HI>Voluntary</HI> thing, and so that it is to be entred no otherwise than by an Holy <HI>Cove∣nant,</HI> or, as the Scripture speaks, by <HI>giving our selves first unto the Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, and then one unto ano∣ther.</HI> He could not think, that <HI>Baptism</HI> alone was to be accounted the <HI>cause,</HI> but rather the <HI>effect,</HI> of Church-member-ship; inasmuch as up∣on the dissolution of the Church to which a man belongs, his <HI>Baptism</HI> would not become a Nullity: nor that meer <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rof ssum</HI> would render men <HI>members</HI> of this or that <HI>Church;</HI> for then it would be impossible to cut off a corrupt mem∣ber from that Body Politic: Nor that meer <HI>Co-habitation</HI> would make <HI>Church-members;</HI> for then the vilest infidels would be actually incor∣porated with us And a <HI>Covenant,</HI> was all that he now saw remaining in the <HI>Inventory.</HI></P>
<P>But for the <HI>Subjects</HI> to be admitted by <HI>Chur∣ches</HI> unto all the priviledges of this Fellowship
<PB N="67" REF="38"/> with them he thought, they ought to be such as a <HI>trying Charity,</HI> or a <HI>charitable Tryal,</HI> should pronounce, <HI>Regenerate.</HI> He found the <HI>first Chur∣ches</HI> of the Gospel mentioned in the Scripture, to be <HI>Churches of Saints;</HI> and that the Apostles writing to them, still acknowledge them to be <HI>Holy Brethren,</HI> and such as were made <HI>meet for to be partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light;</HI> and that a main end of <HI>Church-fel∣lowship,</HI> is to represent unto the world, the Qualifications of those that shall <HI>Ascend into the Hill of the Lord, and Stand in his Holy Place forever.</HI> He would therefore have, <HI>Bona Mens,</HI> and <HI>Purum pectus,</HI> and <HI>Ʋita Innocens,</HI> requi∣red, as <HI>Lactantius</HI> tells us, they were in <HI>his</HI> Dayes, of all Communicants at the Table of the Lord; and with Holy <HI>Chrysostom,</HI> he would sooner have given his <HI>Heart-blood,</HI> than, the <HI>Cup of the Lord,</HI> unto such as had not the hopeful Marks of our Lord's Disciples on them. The Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> still retain a Cus∣tom which the great <HI>Justin Martyr</HI> in the second Century assures us to have been in the Primitive Churches of his Time; namely, <HI>To Examine those they Receive, not only about their perswasion, but also whether they have attained unto a work of Grace upon their Souls.</HI> In the prosecution here∣of, besides the Enquiries of the <HI>Elders</HI> into the <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Belief</HI> and <HI>Conversation</HI> of them that offer themselves unto Church-fellowship, it is expected, tho' I hope not with any severity
<PB N="68" REF="39"/> of imposition, that in the Addresses which the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> make to the Churches, they give some <HI>written,</HI> if not <HI>oral</HI> Account, of what impressions the Re∣generating Word of God has had upon their Souls. This was a <HI>Custum</HI> which this holy man had a marvellous esteem and value for; and I have taken from his Mouth such as these Ex∣pressions very publickly delivered thereabouts.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">It is matter (said he) of great Thankfulness, that we have <HI>Christ Confessed</HI> in our Churches, by such as we Receive to full Communion there. They open the works of <HI>Christ</HI> in their Hearts, and the <HI>Relation</HI> thereof is an emin∣ent <HI>Confession</HI> of our Lord; experienced Saints can gather more than a little from it. It is in∣deed an Ordinance of wonderful benefit; the Lord planted many <HI>Vineyards</HI> in the first Set∣tlement of this Countrey, and there were ma- <HI>Noble Vines</HI> in them; it was their <HI>Heavenly-mindedness</HI> which dispos'd them to this Exercise, and by the upholding of it, the Churches are still filled with <HI>Noble Vines;</HI> it mightily main∣tains purity of Churches.

<P>There were especially two things, which he was loth to <HI>see,</HI> and yet fear'd he <HI>saw,</HI> falling in the Churches of <HI>New-England.</HI> One was, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thorough Establishment of <HI>Ruling-Elders</HI> in our Churches; which he thought sufficiently warranted by the Apostles mention of, <HI>Elders that Rule well, who yet labour not in Word and Do∣ctrine.</HI> He was very desirous to have prudent and gracious men set over our Churches, for the Assistence of their <HI>Pastors,</HI> in the Church acts that concern the <HI>Admission</HI> and <HI>Excl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> of Members, and the <HI>Inspection</HI> of the Conversation led by the Communicants, and the <HI>Instruction</HI> of their several Families, and the <HI>Visitation</HI> of the Afflicted in the Flock over which they should preside. Such <HI>Helps in Government</HI> had he him∣self been blessed withal; the last of which was the well-deserving Elder <HI>Bowles;</HI> and of <HI>him,</HI> did this good man, in a Speech to a <HI>Synod</HI> of all the Churches in this Colony, take occasion to
<PB N="70" REF="40"/> say, <HI>There is my Brother</HI> Bowles, <HI>the godly Elder of our Church at</HI> Roxbury, <HI>God helps him to do great things among us!</HI> Had all our <HI>Pastors</HI> been so well accommodated, it is possible there would be more encouragement given to such an Office as that of <HI>Ruling Elders.</HI></P>
<P>But the mention of a <HI>Synod</HI> brings to mind a∣nother thing, which he was Concerned, that we might never want; and that is, a frequent Re∣petition of <HI>Needful Synods</HI> in our Churches. For tho' he had a deep and a due care to preserve the <HI>Rights of particular Churches,</HI> yet he thought all the Churches of the Lord Jesus by their <HI>Ʋnion</HI> in what they <HI>profess,</HI> in what they <HI>in∣tend,</HI> and in what they <HI>enioy,</HI> so compacted into one <HI>Body Mystical,</HI> as that all the several <HI>par∣ticular Churches</HI> every where should <HI>act</HI> with a regard unto the good of the whole, and unto the common <HI>Advice</HI> and <HI>Counsil</HI> of the Neighbourhood; which cannot be done al∣ways by <HI>Letters missive,</HI> like those that passed between <HI>Corinth</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> in the early dayes of Christianity; but it requires a Convention of the Churches in <HI>Synods,</HI> by their <HI>Delegates</HI> and <HI>Messengers.</HI> He did not count Churches to be so <HI>Independent,</HI> as that they can always discharge their whole Duty, and yet not act in a conjunc∣tion with Neighbour-Churches; nor would he be of any Church that will not acknowledge it self <HI>accountable</HI> to rightly composed <HI>Synods,</HI> which may have occasion to enquire into the
<PB N="71" REF="40"/> circumstances of it; he saw the main <HI>Interest</HI> and <HI>Business</HI> of Churches might quickly come to be utterly lost, if <HI>Synods</HI> were not often called for the Repairing of Inconveniences, and he was much in contriving for the regular and re∣peated meeting of <HI>such</HI> Assemblies.</P>
<P>He wish'd for <HI>Councils</HI> to suppress all dam∣nable Heresies or pernicious Opinions that might ever arise among us; for <HI>Councils</HI> to extinguish all dangerous Divisions, &amp; scandalous Contentions which might ever begin to flame in our Borders; for <HI>Councils</HI> to rectify all Male-Administrations in the midst of us, or to Recover any particular Churches out of any Disorders which they may be plung'd into, for <HI>Councils</HI> to enquire into the Love, the Peace, the Holiness ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntained by the several Churches; in fine, for <HI>Councils</HI> to send forth fit <HI>Labourers</HI> into those parts of our Lords <HI>Harvest;</HI> which are without the Gospel of God. He be∣held an Apostolical Precept and Pattern for such <HI>Councils;</HI> and when such <HI>Councils</HI> convened in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, by the consent of several Churches concerned in mutual Communion, have Declared, Explained, Recom∣mended the mind of God from his word unto us, he reckoned a truth so delivered, challenged an Observation from the particular Churches, with a very great <HI>Authority.</HI></P>
<P>He therefore Printed an ingenious little Book wearing this Title, <HI>The Divine Management of
<PB N="72" REF="41"/> Gospel-Churches by the Ordinance of Councils, con∣stituted in order according to the Scriptures, which may be a means of uniting those two holy and emi∣nent Parties, the</HI> Presbyterians, <HI>&amp; the</HI> Congrega∣tional. It is a remarkable Concession made by the Incomparable <HI>Jurieu</HI> who is not reckoned a <HI>Con∣gregational</HI> man, in his <HI>Traite de L'Ʋnite de L'Eglise,</HI> That the <HI>Apostolical Churches lived not in any Confederation for mutual Dependence. The grand Equipage of Metropolitans, of Primates, of Exarchs, of Patriarks, was yet unknown; nor does it any more appear to us, that the Churches then had their Provincial, National, and Oecumenical Synods; e∣very Church was its own Mistress, and independent on any other.</HI> But on the other side, our <HI>Eliot,</HI> who was no <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> conceived <HI>Synods</HI> to be the Institutions of our Lord Jesus Christ, the <HI>Apostolical Churches themselves</HI> acknowledging a Stamp of <HI>Divine Right</HI> upon them.</P>
<P>Such as these were the sentiments of our <HI>Eliot;</HI> &amp; his deserved Reputation in the Church∣es of <HI>New-England,</HI> is that which has caused me to foresee some Advantage and Benefit ari∣sing unto the concerns of the Gospel, by so large a Recitation as I have now made thereof.</P>

<P>THe Titles of a <HI>Christian</HI> and of a <HI>Minister,</HI> have rendred our <HI>Eliot</HI> considerable; but there is one memorable Title more, by which he has been signalized unto us. An honoura∣ble person did once in Print put the Name of an <HI>Evangelist</HI> upon him; whereupon in a Let∣ter of his to that person afterwards Printed, his Expressions were, <Q REND="margQuotes">There is a <HI>Redundancy,</HI> where you put the Title of <HI>Evangelist</HI> upon me; I beseech you to suppress all such thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> let us do and speak and carry all things with Humility; it is the Lord who hath done what is done; and it is most becoming the Spirit of Jesus Christ to lift up him, and say our∣selves low; I wish that word could be oblitera∣ted.</Q> My Reader sees what a caution Mr. <HI>E∣liot</HI> long-since entred against our giving him the Title of an <HI>Evangelist;</HI> but his <HI>Death</HI> has now made it <HI>safe,</HI> as his <HI>Life</HI> had long made it <HI>just,</HI> for us to acknowledge him with such a Title. I know not whether that of an <HI>Evan∣gelist,</HI> or one separated for the employment of Preaching the Gospel in such places where no
<PB N="74" REF="42"/> Churches have hitherto been gathered, be not an <HI>Office</HI> that should be continued in our days; but this I know, that our <HI>Eliot</HI> very notably did the <HI>Service</HI> and <HI>Business</HI> of such an Officer.</P>
<P>¶ The Natives of the Countrey now Pos∣sessed by the <HI>New-Englanders,</HI> had been forlorn and wretched <HI>Heathen</HI> ever since their first herd∣ing here; and tho we know not <HI>When</HI> or <HI>How</HI> those Indians first became Inhabitants of this mighty Continent, yet we may guess that prob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣bly, the Divel decoy'd those miserable Salvages hither, in hopes that the Gospel of the Lord Jesus would never come here to destroy or dis∣turb his <HI>Absolute-Empire</HI> over them. But our <HI>Eliot</HI> was in such ill terms with the Divel, as to alarm him with sounding the <HI>Silver-Trum∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts</HI> of Heaven in his Territories, and make some Noble and Zealous Attempts towards out∣ing him of his Ancient possessions here. Just before the first Arrival of the English in these parts, a prodigious Mortality had swept away vast Numbers of the poor Indians; and those Pagans who being told by a Shipwrack'd French∣man which dy'd in their hands, <HI>That God would shortly extirpate them, and introduce a more civil and worthy people into their place,</HI> blasphe∣mously reply'd, That <HI>God could not kill them;</HI> were quickly <HI>kill'd</HI> with such a raging and wast∣ing Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tilence, as left the very earth covered with their Carcases. Nevertheless, there were, I think, Twenty several <HI>Nations</HI> (if I may call them so) of Indians upon that spot of ground,
<PB N="75" REF="42"/> which fell under the Influence of our <HI>Three Ʋni∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d Colonies;</HI> and our <HI>Eliot</HI> was willing to rescue as many of them as he could, from that old usurping <HI>Land-Lord</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> who is <HI>by the wrath of God, the Prince of this world.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot find that any besides the Holy Spi∣rit of God, first moved him to the blessed Work of <HI>Evangelizing</HI> these perishing Indians; 'twas that Holy Spirit which laid before his mind the <HI>Idaea</HI> of that which is now on the <HI>Seal</HI> of the Massachuset-Colony; <HI>A poor Indian having a Label going from his mouth, with a,</HI> COME OVER AND HELP US. It was the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ, which enkind∣led in him a <HI>Pitty,</HI> for the dark dying, damning souls of these Natives, whom <HI>the god of this world had blinded,</HI> through all the By past Ages. He was none of those that make, <HI>The Salvation of the Heathen,</HI> an Article of their <HI>Creed;</HI> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t (setting aside the unrevealed and extraordinary Steps which the <HI>Holy One of Israel</HI> may take out of His <HI>usual Pathes</HI>) he thought men to be <HI>lost</HI> if our <HI>Gospel</HI> be <HI>hidden</HI> from them; and he was of the same Opinion with one of the Ancients, who said, <HI>Some have endeavoured to prove</HI> Plato <HI>a Christian, till they prove themselves little better than Heathen.</HI> It is indeed a principle in the Turkish <HI>Alcoran,</HI> That <HI>Let a man's Religi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n be what it will, he shall be saved, if he conscientiously live up to the Rules of it:</HI> but our <HI>Eliot</HI> was no <HI>Mahometan.</HI> He could most heartily subscribe
<PB N="76" REF="43"/> to that passage in the Articles of the Ch. of <HI>Eng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> <Q REND="margQuotes">They are to be held accursed, who presume to say, that every man shall be saved by the Law or Sect which he professeth, so that he be dili∣gent to frame his life according to that Law, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Light of Nature; For Holy Scripture doth set out unto us, Only the Name of Je∣sus Christ, whereby men must be Saved.</Q> And it astonished him to see many dissembling Subscribers of those Articles, while they have grown up to such a <HI>Phrensy,</HI> as to deny peremp∣torily all <HI>Church-state,</HI> and all <HI>Salvation</HI> to all that are not under <HI>Diocesan Bishops,</HI> yet at the same time to grant that the <HI>Heathen</HI> might be saved without the Knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. No, it very powerfully moved his holy Bowels, to hear the Thunderclapps of that Imprecation over the heads of our Naked Indians, <HI>Pour out thy Fury upon the Heathen that know thee not;</HI> and thought he, <HI>What shall I do to rescue these Heathen from that all-devouring Fury?</HI></P>
<P>But when this Charitable pitty had once begun to flame, there was a concurrence of ma∣ny things to cast <HI>Oyl</HI> into it. All the good men in the Country were glad of his Engage∣ment in such an undertaking; the <HI>Ministers</HI> es∣pecially encouraged him, and those in the Neigh∣bourhood kindly supply'd his place, and per∣form'd his work, in part, for him at <HI>Roxbury,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hile he was <HI>Abroad</HI> Labouring among them
<PB N="77" REF="43"/> that were <HI>Without.</HI> Hereunto, he was further <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wakened by those expressions in the <HI>Royal Char∣ter,</HI> in the assurance and protection whereof this Wilderness was first peopled; namely, <HI>To win and incite the</HI> Natives <HI>of that Country to the know∣ledge and Obedience of the only true God and Savi∣our of Mankind, and the Christian Faith, in our Royal Intention, and the Adventurers free profession is the principal end of the Plantation.</HI> And the remarkable zeal of the Romish Missionaries, <HI>com∣passing Sea and Land that they might make Prose∣lytes,</HI> made his devout Soul think of it with a further Disdain, that we should come any whit behind in our care to Evangelize the <HI>Indians,</HI> whom we dwelt among. Lastly, when he had well begun this <HI>Evangelical Business,</HI> the good God, in an answer to his Prayers, mercifully stirred up a liberal Contribution among the god∣ly people in <HI>England</HI> for the promoting of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by means whereof, a considerable <HI>Estate</HI> and <HI>Income</HI> was at length entrusted in the hands of an Honourable <HI>Corporation,</HI> by whom 'tis to this Day very carefully employ'd in the Christi∣an Service, which it was designed for. And then, in short; inasmuch as our Lord Jesus had bestow'd on <HI>us,</HI> our <HI>Eliot</HI> was gratefully and ge∣nerously desirous to obtain for <HI>him, The Heathen for an Inheritance, and the utmost parts of the Earth for a Possession.</HI></P>
<P>The exemplary <HI>Charity</HI> of this excellent per∣son in this important Affair, will not be seen in

<P>They live in a Countrey, full of the best <HI>Ship-Timber</HI> under Heaven: but never, saw a <HI>Ship</HI> till some came from <HI>Europe</HI> hither; and then they were scar'd out of their wits, to see the <HI>Monster</HI> come sailing in, and spitting fire with a mighty noise, out of her floating side; they cross the water, in <HI>Canoo's,</HI> made sometimes of <HI>Trees</HI> which they burn and hew, till they have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ollow'd them; and sometimes of <HI>Barks,</HI> which they stitch into a light fort of a Vessel, to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asily carried over land; if they over-sett, it is but a little paddling like a dog, and they are soon where they were.</P>

<P>I confess, there was one, I cannot call it so much <HI>guess</HI> as <HI>wish,</HI> wherein he was willing a little to indulge himself; and that was, <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> our</HI> Indians <HI>are the posterity of the dispe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed and rejected</HI> Israelites, <HI>concerning</HI> whom our God has promised that they shall yet <HI>be saved, by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣liverer coming to turn away ungodliness, from them.</HI> He saw the <HI>Indians</HI> using many <HI>Parables</HI> in their Discourses; much given to Anointing of their <HI>Heads;</HI> much delighted in <HI>Dancing,</HI> especially after Victories; computing their Times by <HI>Nights</HI> and <HI>Months;</HI> giving <HI>Dowries</HI> for Wives, and causing their Women to <HI>dwell by themselves,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> certain seasons, for secret causes; and ac∣customing
<PB REF="47"/> customing themselves to grievous <HI>Mournings</HI> &amp; <HI>Yellings</HI> for the Dead; all which were, usual things among the <HI>Israelites.</HI> They have too a great unkindness for our <HI>Swine;</HI> but I suppose that is because our <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gs</HI> devour the <HI>Clams</HI> which are a Dainty with them. He also saw some learned men, looking for the lost <HI>Israelites</HI> a∣mong the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> and counting that they had <HI>Thorow-good</HI> reasons for doing so. And a few small <HI>Arguments,</HI> or indeed but <HI>Con∣jectures,</HI> meeting with a favourable Disposition in the Hearer, will carry some conviction with them; especially, if a Report of a <HI>Menasseh ben Israel</HI> be to back them. He saw likewise the <HI>Judgments</HI> threatned unto the <HI>Israelites</HI> of old, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trangly fulfilled upon our <HI>Indians;</HI> particularly that, <HI>Ye shal eat the flesh of your Sons,</HI> which is done with exquisite Cruelties upon the Prisoners that they take from one another in their Battels. Moreover, 'tis a Prophesy in Deut. 28.68. <HI>The Lord shall bring thee into Egypt again with Ships, by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again; and there shall ye be sold unto your Enemies, and no man shall buy you.</HI> This did out <HI>Eliot</HI> imagine accomplished, when the Captives taken by us in our late <HI>wars</HI> upon them, were sent to be sold, in the Coasts lying not very remote from <HI>Egypt</HI> on the <HI>Me∣diterranean</HI> Sea, and scarce any Chapmen would offer to take them off. Being upon such as these accounts not unwilling, if it were possible, to
<PB N="85" REF="47"/> have, the <HI>Indians</HI> found <HI>Israelites,</HI> they were you may be sure, not a whit the less, <HI>Beloved for their</HI> (supposed) <HI>Fathers sake;</HI> and the Fa∣tigues of his Travails went on the more <HI>chear∣fully,</HI> or at least, the more <HI>hopefully,</HI> because of such possibilities.</P>
<P>The <HI>First step</HI> which he judg'd Necessary now to be taken by him, was to learn the <HI>Indian</HI>-language; for he saw them so stupid and senseless that they would never do so much as enquire after the Religion of the strangers now come into their Country, much less would they so far imitate us as to leave off their beastly way of living, that they might be par∣takers of any Spiritual Advantage by us: un∣less we could first address them in a <HI>Language</HI> of their own. Behold, new difficulties to be surmounted by our indefatigable <HI>Eliot!</HI> He hires a Native to teach him this exotick lan∣guage, and with a laborious care and skill, reduces it into a <HI>Grammar</HI> which afterwards he published. There is a Letter or two of <HI>our</HI> Alphabet, which the Indians never had in <HI>theirs;</HI> tho there were enough of the <HI>Dog</HI> in their <HI>Temper,</HI> there can scarce be found an R in their <HI>language;</HI> save that the Indians to the Northward, who have a peculiar <HI>Dialect,</HI> pro∣nounce an R where an N is pronounced by our Indians; but if their <HI>Alphabet</HI> be <HI>short,</HI> I am sure the <HI>words</HI> composed of it are <HI>long</HI> enough to tire the patience of any scholar in the
<PB N="86" REF="48"/> world; they are <HI>Sesquipedalia Verba</HI> which their <HI>Linguo</HI> is composed of; one would think, they had been growing ever since <HI>Babel,</HI> unto the Dimentions to which they are now extended. For instance, if my Reader will count how many Letters there are in this one word, <HI>Nummatchekodtantamooong anunnonash,</HI> when he has done, for his reward I'le tell him, it signifies no more in English than, <HI>our Lusts;</HI> and if I were to translate, <HI>our Loves,</HI> it must be nothing shorter than, <HI>Noowoman∣tammoo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nkanunonnash.</HI> Nor do we find in all this Language the least Affinity to, or Deriva∣tion from, any <HI>Europae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> speech that we are acquainted with. I know not what thoughts it will produce in my Reader, when I inform him, that once finding that the <HI>Daemons</HI> in a possessed young woman, whereof I have here∣tofore given the world some account, under∣stood the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>H brew</HI> Lan∣guages, my curiosity led me to make trial of this <HI>Indian</HI> language, and the <HI>Demons</HI> did seem as if they did not understand it.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Worthy and much Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOur Leters were very grateful to me, <HI>(a)</HI> by which I understand that you and others in your famous University of <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> desire to be informed concerning the converted <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>America:</HI> Take therefore a true Account of them in a few words.</P>
<P>It is above forty Years since that truly godly Man, Mr. <HI>John Elliot,</HI> Pastour of the Church at <HI>Rocksborough,</HI> (about a mile from <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI>) being warmed with a holy Zeal of Converting the <HI>Americans,</HI> set himself to
<PB REF="49"/> learn the <HI>Indian</HI> Tongue, that he might more easily and successfully (b) open to them the Mysteries of the Gospel; upon account of which he has been (and not undeservedly) called, <HI>The Apostle of the American Indians.</HI> This Reverend Person, not without very great labour, Tran∣slated the whole Bible into the <HI>Indian</HI> Tongue; (c) he Translated also several <HI>English</HI> Treatises of Practical Divinity and Catechisms into their Language. Above 26 Years agoe he gathered a Church of Converted <HI>Indians</HI> in a Town called <HI>(d) Natick;</HI> these <HI>Indians</HI> confess'd their sins with Tears, and professed their Faith in Christ, and afterwards they and their Children were Bap∣tized, and they were solemnly joyned together in a Church-Covenant; the said Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI> was the first that Administred the Lords Supper to them. The Pastor of that Church now is an <HI>Indian,</HI> his Name is <HI>Daniel.</HI> Besides this Church at <HI>Natick,</HI> among our Inhabitants in the <HI>Massa∣chusets</HI> Colony there are four <HI>Indian</HI> Assemblies, (e) where the Name of the true God and Jesus Christ is solemnly called upon; these Assemblies have some <HI>American</HI> Preachers. Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI> former∣ly used to Preach to them once every fortnight, but now he is weakned with Labours and Old-age, being in the Eighty fourth Year of his Age, and Preacheth not to the <HI>Indians</HI> oftner than once in two Months.</P>
<P>There is another Church, consisting only of Converted <HI>Indians,</HI> about fifty Miles from hence
<PB REF="50"/> in an Indian Town called <HI>Mashippaug:</HI> the first Pastor of that Church was an <HI>English</HI> Man, who being skilfull in the American Language, Preach∣ed the Gospel to them in their own Tongue. (f) This <HI>English</HI> Pastor is dead, and instead of him that Church has an <HI>Indian</HI> Preacher.</P>
<P>There are besides that, five Assemblies of <HI>Indians</HI> profess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng the Name of Christ, not far distant from <HI>Mashippa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g,</HI> which have <HI>Indian</HI> Preachers: (g) <HI>John C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ton,</HI> Pastor of the Church at <HI>Plymouth</HI> (Son of my venerable Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her-in-Law <HI>John Cotton,</HI> formerly the famous Teacher of the Church at <HI>B ston</HI>) hath made very great progress in learning the <HI>Indian</HI> Tongue, and is very skifull in it; he Preaches in their own Lan∣guage to the last five mentioned Congregations every Week. Moreover of the Inhabitants of <HI>Sacones</HI> in <HI>Plymo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th</HI> Colony there is a great Con∣gregation of those who for distinction sake are called <HI>Praying Indians,</HI> because they Pray to God in Christ</P>
<P>Not far from a promontory called <HI>Cape <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od,</HI> there are six Assemblies of Heathens who are to be reckoned as <HI>Catech<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mens,</HI> amongst whom there are six <HI>Indian</HI> Preachers: <HI>Samu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Trea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> Pastor of a Church at <HI>Eastham,</HI> Preacheth to those Congregations in their own Language. There are likewise amongst the Islanders of <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ucket</HI> a Church, with a Pastor who was lately a Heathen, and several Meetings of <HI>Ca∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> who are instructed by the Converted
<PB REF="50"/> <HI>Indians.</HI> There is also another Island about se∣ven Leagues long (called <HI>Marthas Ʋineyard</HI>) where are two American Churches planted, which are more famous than the rest, over one of which there presides an ancient <HI>Indian</HI> as Pastor, called <HI>Hiac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oms: John Hiacooms,</HI> Son of the said <HI>Indian</HI> Pastor, also Preacheth the Gos∣pel to his Countrey-men. In another Church in that place, <HI>John <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ockinosh</HI> a Converted <HI>Indian</HI> teaches. In these Churches <HI>ruling Elders</HI> of the <HI>Indians</HI> are joyned to the Pastors: The Pastors were chosen by the people, and when they had fasted and prayed, Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI> and Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> laid their Hands on them, so that they were solemnly Ordained. All the Congregations <HI>(n)</HI> of the Converted <HI>Indians</HI> (both the <HI>Cate∣chumens</HI> and those in Church Order) every Lords-day meet together; the pastor or Preacher always begins with Prayer, and <HI>without a Form, because from the Heart;</HI> when the Ruler of the Assembly has ended Prayer, the wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Congre∣gation of <HI>Indians</HI> Praise God with singing some of them are excellent Singers: After the Psalm, he that Preaches reads a place of Scripture (one or more verses as he will) and expounds its gathers Doctrines from it proves them b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Scrip∣tures and Reasons, and infers uses from them after the manner of the <HI>English,</HI> of wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> have been taught; then another prayer to God in the Name of Christ concludes the whole Service. Thus do they meet together twice
<PB REF="51"/> every Lords-day. They observe no <HI>Holy-days</HI> but the <HI>Lords-day,</HI> except upon some extraordinary occasion; and then they solemnly set apart whole days, either in giving Thanks or Fasting and Praying with great fervour of mind.</P>
<P>Before the <HI>English</HI> came into these Coasts these barbarous Nations were altogether igno∣rant of the true God; hence it is that in their Prayers and Sermons they use <HI>English</HI> Words and Terms; he that calls upon the most Holy Name of God, says, <HI>Jehovah,</HI> or <HI>God,</HI> or <HI>Lord,</HI> and also they have learned and borrowed many other Theological Phrases from us.</P>

<HEAD><HI>(a)</HI> The Success of the Gospel in the EAST INDIES</HEAD>
<P>AFter the Writing of <HI>this</HI> Letter, there came <HI>one</HI> to my Hands from the famous Dr. <HI>Lousden,</HI> together with a new and fair Edition of his <HI>Hebrew Psalter,</HI> Dedicated unto the Name of my Absent Parent. He therein in∣forms me, That our Example had awakened the <HI>Dutch</HI> to make some noble Attempts for the Furtherance of the Gospel in the <HI>East-In∣dies;</HI> besides what memorable things were done by the Excellent <HI>Robert Junius,</HI> in <HI>Formosa</HI> fifty years ago. He also informs me, That in and near the Island of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> Pastors have Baptised about three hundred Thousand of the <HI>Eastern Indians;</HI> for altho' the Mini∣sters are utterly ignorant of their Language, yet there are <HI>School-Masters</HI> who teach them, The <HI>Lords Prayer,</HI> the <HI>Creed,</HI> the <HI>Ten Command∣ments,</HI> a <HI>Morning Prayer,</HI> an <HI>Evening Prayer,</HI> a <HI>Blessing</HI> before Meat, and <HI>another</HI> after; and the Minister in his Visits being assured by the Ma∣ster, who of them has learn'd all of them <HI>seven</HI> things, he thereupon counts they have such a <HI>perfect number</HI> of Attainments, that he presently <HI>Baptises</HI> them. The pious Reader will doubt∣less
<PB N="95" REF="52"/> bless God for <HI>this;</HI> but he will easily see that <HI>one</HI> of our Converted Indians has cost more pains than <HI>many</HI> of those; more <HI>thorough work</HI> has been made with them.</P>

<HEAD>(b) <HI>Mr. Eliot</HI>'s way of opening the Mysteries of the Gospel to our <HI>INDIANS</HI></HEAD>
<P>Twas in the year 1646. that Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI> ac∣company'd by three more, gave a visit unto an Assembly of <HI>Indians,</HI> of whom he de∣sired a Meeting at such a time and place, that he might lay before them the things of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Eternal Peace. After a serious <HI>Prayer,</HI> he gave them a <HI>Sermon</HI> which continued about a quar∣ter above an hour, and contained the principal Articles of the Christian Religion, applying all to the condition of the <HI>Indians</HI> present Having done, he asked of them, whether <HI>they understood?</HI> and with a general reply they an∣swered, <HI>They understood all.</HI> He then began what was his usual method afterwards in treat∣ing with them; that is, he caused them to pro∣pound such <HI>questions</HI> as they pleas'd, unto him∣self; and he gave wise and good <HI>answers</HI> to them all. Their <HI>Questions</HI> would often, tho'
<PB N="96" REF="53"/> not always, refer to what he had newly Preach∣ed; and he this way not only made a <HI>Proof</HI> of their profiting by his Ministry, but also gave an <HI>Edge</HI> to what he delivered unto them. Some of their <HI>Questions</HI> would be a little <HI>Philosophical,</HI> and required a good measure of Learning in the Minister concerned with them; but for this our <HI>Eliot</HI> wanted not. He would also put pro∣per <HI>Questions</HI> unto them, and at one of his first Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rcises with them, he made the young ones ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able of regarding those three Questions,</P>
<P>Q. 1. <HI>Who made you and all the world?</HI></P>
<P>Q. 2. <HI>Who do you look should save you from Sin and Hell?</HI></P>
<P>Q. 3. <HI>How many Commandments has the Lord given you to keep?</HI></P>
<P>It was his wisdom that he began with them upon such principles, as they themselves had already some Notions of; such as that of an <HI>Heaven</HI> for good, and <HI>Hell</HI> for bad people, when they <HI>Dy'd.</HI> It broke his gracious heart within him to see, what Floods of Tears fell from the Eyes of several among these Degenerate Salva∣ges, at the first Addresses which he made unto them; yea, from the very worst of them all. He was very inquisitive to learn who were the <HI>Powawes,</HI> that is, the <HI>Sorcerers</HI> and <HI>Seducers,</HI> that maintained the Worship of the Devil in any of their Societies; and having in one of his first Journeys to them, found out one of those Wretches, he made the Indian come unto
<PB N="97" REF="53"/> him and said, <HI>Whether do you suppose</HI> God, <HI>or</HI> Chepian <HI>(i. e. the Devil) to be the Author of all good?</HI> The Conjurer answered, <HI>God.</HI> Upon this he added with a stern Countenance, <HI>Why do you pray to</HI> Chepian <HI>then?</HI> and the poor man was not able to stand or speak before him; but at last made promises of Reformation.</P>
<P>The Text which he first Preach'd upon, was that in Ezek. 37.9, 10. <HI>That by Prophesying to the Wind, the Wind came and the dry bones lived;</HI> and it was an observation made by one, who then justly confessed, there was <HI>not much weight</HI> in it; That the word which the Indians use for <HI>Wind</HI> is <HI>Wauban,</HI> and an Indian of that Name was one of the first that here zealously promoted the Conversion of his Neighbours. But having thus entred upon the <HI>Teaching</HI> of these poor Creatures, t'is incredible how much time, toyl, and hardship, he underwent in the Prosecution of this Undertaking; how many weary dayes and nights rolled over him; how many tiresome Journeys he endured; and how many terrible dangers, he had experince of. If you briefly would know <HI>what</HI> he felt, and <HI>what</HI> carried him through all, take it in his own words, in a Letter to the Honourable Mr. <HI>Winslow;</HI> says he, <HI>I have not been dry night nor day, from the third day of the week unto the sixth, but so Tra∣velled, and at night pull off my Boots, wring my blockings, and on with them again, and so continue,
<PB N="98" REF="54"/> But God steps in and helps. I have considered the Word of God in</HI> 2. Tim. 2.3. Endure hardship as a good Souldier of Christ.</P>

<P>ONe of his Remarkable Cares for these illi∣terate Indians, was to bring them into the use of <HI>Schools</HI> and <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ks.</HI> He quickly procured the benefit of <HI>Schools</HI> for them; wherein they profited so much, that not only very many of them quickly came to <HI>Read</HI> and <HI>Write,</HI> but also several arrived unto a Lib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ral Education in our Colledge, and one or two of them took their degree with the rest of our <HI>Graduates.</HI> And for <HI>Books,</HI> t'was his chief desire that the sacred Scriptures might not in an <HI>unknown Tongue</HI> be Locked or Hidden from them; very hateful and hellish did the <HI>policy</HI> of <HI>Popery</HI> appear to him on this Account; Our <HI>Eliot</HI> was very unlike to that <HI>Franciscan,</HI> who writing into <HI>Europe</HI> gloried much how many thousands of <HI>Indian</HI> he had Converted, but added, <HI>That he desire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Friend would send him the Book called th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Bible; <HI>for he had heard of there being such a Boo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in</HI> Europe, <HI>which might be of some use to him.</HI>
<PB N="99" REF="54"/> No, our <HI>Eliot</HI> found he could not live without a <HI>Bible</HI> himself; he would have parted with all his Estate sooner than have lost a Leaf of it; and he knew it would be of more than <HI>some use</HI> unto the <HI>Indians</HI> too; he therefore with a vast La∣bour translated the <HI>Holy Bible</HI> into the <HI>Indian Language.</HI> Behold, ye <HI>Americans,</HI> the greatest Honour that ever you were Partakers of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> This Bible was Printed here at our <HI>Cambrid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>;</HI> and it is the only Bible that ever was Printed in all <HI>America,</HI> from the very Foundation of the World.

<HEAD>(d) His Gathering of a Church at NATICK</HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> that had felt the Impressions of his Ministry, were quickly distin∣guished by the Name of, <HI>Praying Indians;</HI> and these <HI>Praying Indians</HI> as q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ickly were for a more Decent, and English way of Living, and they desired a more Fixed <HI>Cohabitation.</HI> At se∣veral Places did they now combine and settle; But the place of Greatest Name among their Towns, is that of <HI>Natick.</HI></P>
<P>Here 'twas, that in the year 1651. those that had heretofore lived like the <HI>wild Beasts</HI> in the Wilderness now compacted themselves into a Town; and they first apply'd themselves to the forming of their <HI>Civil Government.</HI> Our <HI>Gene∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al Court,</HI> notwithstanding their exact study to keep these Indians very sensible of their being subject unto the English Empire, yet had allow∣ed them their smaller Courts, wherein they might govern their own smaller Cases and Con∣cerns, after their own particular Modes, and might have their <HI>Town-Orders,</HI> if I may cast them so, peculiar to themselves. With respect hereunto, Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI> on a Solemn <HI>Fast</HI> made a publick <HI>Vow, That seeing these Indians were not prep ssessed with any Forms of Government, he would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nstruct them into such a Form, as we had written
<PB N="101" REF="55"/> in the Word of God, that so they might be a people in all things ruled by the Lord.</HI> Accordingly, he Expounded unto them the eighteenth Chapter of <HI>Exodus;</HI> and then they chose Rulers of <HI>Hundreds,</HI> of <HI>Fifties,</HI> of <HI>Tens;</HI> and therewithal Entred into this Covenant.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">We are the sons of <HI>Adam;</HI> We and our Forefathers have a long time been Lost in our sins; but now the mercy of the Lord begin∣neth to find us out again;</Q> therefore the grace of Christ helping us, we do give our selves and our Children, unto God, to be his people. He shall Rule us in all our Affairs; <Q REND="margQuotes">The Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Law-giver, the Lord is our King; he will save us; and the wisdome which God has taught us in his Book shall guide us. Oh Jehovah, Teach us Wisdome; send thy Spirit into our hearts; take us to be thy people, and lett us take thee to be our God.</Q></P>
<P>Such an o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inion about the perfection of the Scripture had he, that he thus expressed him∣self upon this occasion, <HI>God will bring Nations into Distress and Perplexity, that so they may be forced unto the Scriptures; all Governments will be shaken, that men may be forced at length to Pitch upon that firm foundation,</HI> The Word of God.</P>
<P>The Little Towns of these Indians being pitch∣ed upon this <HI>foundation,</HI> they utterly abandoned that <HI>Polygamy</HI> which had heretofore been Com∣mon among them; they made severe Lawes
<PB N="102" REF="56"/> against <HI>Fornication, Drunkenness,</HI> and <HI>Sabbath-breaking,</HI> and other Immoralities; and they next began to <HI>Lament</HI> after the Establishment of a <HI>Church-order</HI> among them, and after the several Ordinances and Priviledges of a <HI>Church-Com∣munion.</HI> The Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> have usually been very strict in their Admissions to <HI>Church-Fellowship,</HI> and required very signal de∣monstrations of a <HI>Repenting</HI> and a <HI>Believing</HI> Soul, before they thought men fit subjects to be en∣trusted with, <HI>The Rights of the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> But they seem'd rather to Augment than Abate their usual <HI>Strictness,</HI> when the examination of the <HI>Indians</HI> was to be performed. A Day was therefore set apart, which they called, <HI>Na∣tootom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>threack<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>suk,</HI> or, a <HI>Day of Asking Questions,</HI> when the ministers of the Adjacent Churches, assisted with all the best Interpreters that could be had, publickly examined a good Number of these <HI>Indians,</HI> about their Attainments both in <HI>Knowledge</HI> and in <HI>Vertue.</HI> And notwithstand∣ing the great satisfaction then received, our Churches being willing to proceed <HI>Surely,</HI> and therefore <HI>Slowly,</HI> in Raising them up to a <HI>Church-State</HI> which might be Comprehended in our <HI>Con∣sociations,</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> were afterwards called in Considerable Assemblies convened for that purpose, to make open <HI>Confessions</HI> of their <HI>Faith</HI> in God and Christ, and of the Efficacy which his <HI>word</HI> had upon them for their <HI>Conversion</HI> to Him; which Confessions being taken in writing
<PB N="103" REF="56"/> from their mouths by able Interpreters, were scanned by the people of God, and found much Acceptance with them.</P>
<P>I need pass no further Censure upon them, than what is given by my Grand-father, the well-known <HI>Richard Mather,</HI> in an Epistle of his, Published on this occasion; says he, <Q REND="margQuotes">There is so much of Gods work among them, as that I cannot but count it a great evil, yea a great in∣jury to God and His Goodness, for any to make light of it. To see and hear Indians o∣pening their mouths, and lifting up their hands and eyes, in Prayer to the Living God, calling on him by his Name <HI>Jehovah,</HI> in the Mediation of Jesus Christ, and this for a good while to∣gether; to see and hear them. Exhorting one another from the Word of God; to see and and hear them confessing the Name of Christ Jesus, and their own sinfulness; sure this is more than usual! And tho' they spoke in a Language, of which many of us understood but little, yet <HI>we</HI> that were present that day, <HI>we</HI> saw and heard them perform the Duties mentioned with such grave and sober Counte∣nances; with such comely Reverence in their Gesture, and their whole carriage, and with such plenty of Tears trickling down the Cheeks of some of them, as did argue to us that they spake with the Holy Fear of God, and is much affected our Hearts.</Q></P>
<P>At length was a <HI>Church-state</HI> settled among
<PB N="104" REF="57"/> them: they entred, as <HI>our</HI> Churches do, into an holy Covenant, wherein they <HI>gave themselves, first unto the Lord, and then unto one another,</HI> to attend the Rules, and Helps, and expect the Blessings of the <HI>Everlasting Gospel;</HI> and Mr. <HI>Eliot,</HI> having a Mission from the Church of <HI>Rox∣bury,</HI> unto the work of the Lord Christ among the Indians, conceived himself sufficiently Au∣thorized unto the performing of all <HI>Church-work</HI> about them; grounding i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on <HI>Act.</HI> 13.1, 2, 3, 4. and he accordingly Administred, first the <HI>Baptism,</HI> and then the <HI>Supper</HI> of the Lord unto them.</P>

<P>VVE find four Assemblies of <HI>Praying In∣dians</HI> besides that of <HI>Natick,</HI> in our Neighbourhood. But why no more? Truly, not because our <HI>Eliot</HI> was wanting in his <HI>Offers</HI> and <HI>Labours</HI> for their good; but because many of the obdurate Infidels would not receive the <HI>Gospel of Salvation.</HI> In one of his Letters, I find him giving this <HI>ill report,</HI> with such a <HI>good reason</HI> for it; Lyn-<HI>Indians are all naught, save one,
<PB N="105" REF="57"/> who sometimes comes to hear the Word; and the reason why they are bad, is, principally because their</HI> Sachim <HI>is naught, and careth not to pray unto God.</HI> Indeed the <HI>Sachims,</HI> or the <HI>Princes,</HI> of the Indi∣ans generally did all they could that their Sub∣jects might not entertain the Gospel; the <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣vils</HI> having the <HI>Sachims</HI> on their side, thereby kept their possession of the people too. Their <HI>Pauwaws</HI> or Clergy-men, did <HI>much</HI> to maintain the Interest of the <HI>Devils</HI> in this Wilderness, those <HI>Children of the Devil; and Enemies of all Righteousness,</HI> did not <HI>cease to pervert the Right ways of Lord;</HI> but their <HI>Sachims</HI> or Magistrates did <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re</HI> towards it; for they would presently Raise a Storm of <HI>Persecution</HI> upon any of their vassals that should <HI>Pray</HI> unto the Eternal God. The ground of this conduct in them, was, an odd Fear, that Religion would abridge them of the <HI>Tyranny</HI> which they had been us'd unto; they always like the Divel held their people i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a most absolute servitude, and Rul'd by no <HI>Law</HI> but their <HI>Will,</HI> which left the poor Slaves no∣thing that they could call their <HI>Own.</HI> They now suspected that Religion would put a Bridle upon such usurpations, and oblige them to a more Equal and Humane way of Govern∣ment; they therefore some of them, had the Impudence to Address the English, that no motions about the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> might ever he made unto them; and Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI> some∣times in the Wilderness, without the Com∣pany
<PB REF="58"/> or Assistence of any other Englishman, has been treated in a very Threatening and Bar∣barous manner by some of these Tyrants; but God inspir'd him with so much Resolution as to tell them, <HI>I am about the work of the Great God, and my God is with me; so that I fear neither you, nor all the</HI> Sachims <HI>in the Countrey; I'l go on, and do you Touch mee, if you dare!</HI> upon which the Stoutest of them have shrunk and fell before him. And <HI>One</HI> of them he at length Conquered by preaching unto him a Sermon up∣on the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ations</HI> of Our Lord; particularly, the <HI>Temptation</HI> fetch'd from the <HI>Kingdoms</HI> and <HI>Glories</HI> of the World.</P>
<P>The Little <HI>Kingdoms</HI> and <HI>Glories</HI> of the Great Men among the <HI>Indians,</HI> was a Powerful Obsta∣cle to the success of Mr. <HI>Eliots</HI> Ministry; and it is observable that several of those Nations which thus refused the Gospel, qu ckly af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er∣wards were so <HI>Divel-driven</HI> as to begin an un∣just and bloody <HI>War</HI> upon the English, which issued in their speedy and utter Extirpation from the Face of Gods Earth. It was particu∣larly Remark'd, in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hilip,</HI> the Ring-leader of the most calamitous <HI>war</HI> that ever they made upon us; our <HI>Eliot</HI> made a Tender of the <HI>Ever∣lasting Salvation</HI> to that King; but the monster entertain d it with contempt and anger, and af∣ter the <HI>Indian</HI> mode of joining <HI>signs</HI> with <HI>words</HI> he took <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Button</HI> upon the <HI>Coat</HI> of the Revere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Man, adding <HI>That he cared for his Gospel, just a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="107" REF="58"/> much as he cared for that Button.</HI> The world has heard what a Terrible Ruine soon came up∣on that woful Creature, and upon all his Peo∣ple. It was not long before the Hand which now writes, upon a certain o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>casion took off the <HI>jaw</HI> from the blasphemous exposed <HI>Skull</HI> of that <HI>Leviathan;</HI> and the Renowned <HI>Samuel Lee</HI> is now Pastor to an <HI>English</HI> Congregation, sound∣ing and showing the praises of Heaven, upon that very spot of ground, where <HI>Philip</HI> and his Indians were lately worshipping of the Devil.</P>
<P>Sometimes the more immediate Hand of God, by cutting off the principal Opposers of the Gospel among the Indians made way for Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI>'s Ministry. As, I remember, he relates that an Association of profane Indians near our <HI>Weym<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uth,</HI> set themselves to deter and seduce the Neighbour Indians from the <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s of the Lord.</HI> But God q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ickly sent the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> among them, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ike a <HI>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat Plague</HI> soon swept them away, and thereby engaged the rest unto himself. I need only to add, That one Attempt made by the Devil, to prejud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce the Pagans against the Gospel, had something in it extraordinary. While Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI> was Preaching of <HI>Christ</HI> unto the other Indians, a <HI>Daemon</HI> ap∣peared unto a Prince of the Eastern-Indians, in a shape that had some Resemblance of Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI> or of an <HI>English</HI> Minister, pretending to be, <HI>The English-man</HI>'s <HI>God.</HI> The Spectre command∣ed him, <HI>To forbear the drinking of Rum,</HI> and <HI>To

<HEAD><HI>(f)</HI> The Indian-Churches at <HI>Mashippaug,</HI> and elsewhere.</HEAD>
<P>THe same spirit which acted Mr. <HI>Eliot,</HI> quickly Inspired others elsewhere, to prosecute the work of rescuing the poor Indians out of their worse than <HI>Egyptian</HI>-Darkness, in which <HI>Evil Angels</HI> had been so long preying upon them. One of these was the Godly and Gracious <HI>Richard Bourn,</HI> who soon saw a great effect of his Holy Labours. In the 1666. Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI> ac∣company'd by the Honourable Governour, and several Magistrates and Ministers of <HI>Plymouth</HI>-Colony, procured a vast Assembly at <HI>Mashippaug;</HI> and there a good number of Indians, made con∣fessions touching the <HI>knowledge</HI> and <HI>belief,</HI> and <HI>Regeneration</HI> of their Souls, with such ander<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tan∣ding and affection as was extreamly grateful to the pious Auditory. Yet such was the strictness of the good people in this Affair, that before they would countenance the advanaement of <HI>these Indians</HI> unto <HI>Church-Fellowship,</HI> they orde∣red their Confessions to be written and sent un∣to all the Churches in the Colony, for their Approbation; but so approv'd they were, that afterwards the Messengers of all the Churches giving their <HI>pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sence</HI> and <HI>consent,</HI> they became a Church, and chose Mr. <HI>Bourn</HI> to be their Pas∣tor; who was then by Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI> and Mr. <HI>Cot∣ton</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="60"/> Ordain'd unto that Office over them. From hence Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI> and Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> went over to an Island called <HI>Martha</HI>'s <HI>Vineyard,</HI> where God had so succeeded the honest Labours of some, &amp; particularly of the <HI>Mayhew</HI>'s, as that a Church was gathered.</P>
<P>This Church, after <HI>Fasting and Prayer,</HI> chose one <HI>Hiacoomes</HI> to be their Pastor, <HI>John Tockinosh,</HI> an able and a discreet Christian to be their Teacher; <HI>Joshua Mummeecheegs</HI> and <HI>John Nanaso</HI> to be ruling Elders; and these were then Or∣dained by Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI> and Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> thereunto. Distance of Habitation, caused this one Church by mutual agreement afterwards to become <HI>tw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</HI> the Pastor and one Ruling Elder taking one part, &amp; the Teacher &amp; one Ruling Elder, ano∣ther, &amp; at <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntucket</HI> another adjacent Island was another Church of Indians quickly gathered, who chose an Indian, <HI>John Gib,</HI> to be their Mi∣nister. These <HI>Churches</HI> are so exact in their Admission, and so solemn in their Discipline, &amp; so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rlons in their Communion, that some of the Christian <HI>English</HI> in the Neighbourhood, which would have been loth to have mixed with them in a <HI>civil</HI> Relation, yet have gladly done it in a <HI>Sacred</HI> One</P>
<P>'Tis needless for me to repeat what my Fa∣ther has written about the other Indian Con∣gregations; only there having been made men∣tion of one <HI>Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cooms,</HI> I am willing to annex a Passage or two concerning that memorable Indi∣an. <HI>That</HI> Indian was a very great Instrument
<PB N="111" REF="60"/> of bringing his Pagan and wretched Neighbours, to a saving acquaintance with our Lord Jesus Christ; and God gave him the Honour, not only of so <HI>doing</HI> much for some, but also of <HI>suffering</HI> much from others, of those unhappy Salvages. Once particularly, this <HI>Hiacoomes</HI> received a cruel blow from an Indian P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ince, which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> some En∣glish had not been there, might have killed him, for his <HI>Praying</HI> unto God. And after¦wards he gave this account of his Trial in it; said he, <HI>I have two hands; I had one Hand for Injuries, and the other for God; while I did re∣ceive wrong with the one, the other laid the greater hold on God.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, the <HI>Powawes</HI> did use to hector and abuse the <HI>Praying Indians,</HI> at such a rate, as ter∣rify'd others <HI>from joyning</HI> with them; but once when those <HI>Witches</HI> were bragging, that they could Kill all the <HI>Praying Indians,</HI> if they would; <HI>Hiacoomes</HI> reply'd, <HI>Let all the Powawes in the I∣sland come together, I'l venture my self in the midst, of them; let them use all their witchcrafts; with the help of God, I'l tread upon them all.</HI> By this courage, he silenced the <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wawes:</HI> but at the same time also he Heartned the People, at such a rate as was truly wonderful; nor could any of them ever harm this Eminent Confessor after∣wards; nor indeed any <HI>Proselyte</HI> which had been by his means brought home to God; yea, twas observed after this, that they rather <HI>Kill'd</HI> than <HI>Cur'd</HI> all such of the Heathen as would yet make

<HEAD><HI>(g)</HI> Of Mr. <HI>Eliot's</HI> Fellow-labourers in the INDIAN-WORK.</HEAD>
<P>SO little was the Soul of our <HI>Eliot</HI> infected with any Envy, as that he long'd for nothing more than <HI>Fellow-Labourers,</HI> that might move and shine in the same <HI>Orb</HI> with himself; he made his cryes both to God and Man, for more <HI>Labourers</HI> to be <HI>thrust-forth,</HI> into the <HI>Indian-Harvest;</HI> and indeed it was an <HI>Harvest</HI> of so few secular Advantages and Encouragements, that it must be nothing less than a Divine <HI>Thrust,</HI> which could make any to <HI>Labour</HI> in it. He saw the Answer of his prayers, in the Generous and vigorous Attempts made by several other most worthy preachers of the Gospel, to <HI>Gos∣pellize</HI> our perishing Indians. At the writing of my Fathers letter there were <HI>Four;</HI> but the Number of them increases apace among us. At <HI>Martha</HI>'s Vineyard, the old Mr. <HI>Mayhew,</HI> and several of his Sons, or Grandsons have done very worthily for the Souls of the Indi∣ans; there were fifteen years ago, by compu∣tation, about fifteen hundred Seals of their Ministry upon that one Island. In <HI>Connecticut,</HI> the holy and acute Mr. <HI>Fitch,</HI> has made noble Essays towards the Conversion of the Indians, but, I think, the <HI>Prince</HI> he has to deal withal,
<PB N="113" REF="61"/> being an obstinate Infidel gives unhappy Re∣mora's to the Successes of his Ministry. And godly Mr. <HI>Pierson,</HI> has in that Colony, deserv∣ed well, if I mistake not, upon the same ac∣count. In <HI>Massachusets</HI> we see at this day, the pious Mr. <HI>Daniel Gookin,</HI> the gracious Mr. <HI>Peter Thatcher,</HI> the well-accomplished and in∣dustrious Mr. <HI>Guindal Rawson,</HI> all of them hard at work, to turn these Poor Creatures <HI>from darkness unto light, and from Satan unto God.</HI> In <HI>Plymouth,</HI> we have the most Active Mr. <HI>Samuel Treat</HI> laying out himself to save this Generati∣on; and there is one Mr. <HI>Tupper,</HI> who uses his laudable Endeavours for the instruction of them.</P>
<P>'Tis my Relation to him, that causes me to defer unto the last place, the mention of Mr. <HI>John Cotton,</HI> who addresses the Indians in their own Language with an admirable Dexterity, and has done more than a little Service for them. He hired an <HI>Indian,</HI> after the rate of twelve pence <HI>per</HI> day for <HI>fifty</HI> days, to teach him the <HI>Indian Tongue;</HI> but his knavish Tutor hav∣ing received his whole Pay too soon, ran away before <HI>twenty days</HI> were out; however, in this time he had profited so fat, that he could quickly Preach unto the Natives, and he has ever-since being doing much for God among them.

Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> accompany'd by the Governour and Major-Ge∣neral, and sundry Persons of Quality, made a <HI>Journey</HI> to a Nation of Indians in the Neigh∣bourhood, with a free <HI>Offer</HI> of the <HI>Words where∣by they might be Saved.</HI> The <HI>Prince</HI> took time to consider of it, and according to the true <HI>English</HI> of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aking Time</HI> in such cases, at length he told them, <HI>He did not accept the Tender which they made him.</HI> They then took their leaves of him, not without first giving him this plain and short Admoni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, <HI>If God have any mercy for your miserable people, He will quickly find a way to take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out of the way.</HI> 'Twas presently af∣ter this, that this Prince going forth to a Bat∣tel against ano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her Nation of Indians, was kil∣led in the Fight; and the young Prince being in his <HI>Minority,</HI> the Government fell into the Hands of <HI>Protectors,</HI> which favoured the Interest of the Gospel. Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> being advised of it, speedily and prosperously Renewed the Ti∣dings of an Eternal Saviour to the <HI>Salvages,</HI> who have ever since attended upon his Mini∣stry; and the young <HI>Sachim,</HI> after he came to Age, expressed his Approbation of the Christi∣an Religion; especially, when a while-since, he lay a Dying of a tedious Distemper, and would keep Reading of Mr. <HI>Baxter's Call to the Ʋ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣converted,</HI> with floods of Tears in his Eyes, while he had any strength to do it.</P>

<P>Such as these are the persons, whom our <HI>E∣liot</HI> left Engag'd in the <HI>Indian-work,</HI> when he departed from his <HI>Employment</HI> unto his <HI>Recom∣pence.</HI> And these Gentlemen are so indefatiga∣ble in their Labours among the <HI>Indians,</HI> as that the most <HI>aequal Judges</HI> must acknowledge them worthy of much greater <HI>Salaries</HI> than they are generously contented with.

<P>It only remains that I give a touch or two up∣on the Worship which is attended in the <HI>Syna∣gogues</HI> of the Indians.

<P><HI>Noah</HI> Sacrificed, and so Worshipped. This was the manner of old time. But what <HI>Sa∣crifices</HI> have we <HI>now</HI> to offer? I shall answer by that in Psal. 4.5. <HI>Offer to God the Sacrifice of Righteousness, and put your Trust in the Lord.</HI> These are the true Spiritual <HI>Sacrifices</HI> which God requireth at <HI>our</HI> hands, the <HI>Sacrifices of Righteousness;</HI> that is, we must look to our hearts and ways, that they be <HI>Righteous;</HI> and then we shall be acceptable to God when we Worship him. But if we be unrighteous, unho∣ly, ungodly, we shall not be accepted; our <HI>Sacri∣fices</HI> will be stark naught. Again, We are <HI>to put our Trust in the Lord.</HI> Who else is there for us to trust in? We must believe in the Word of God; if we doubt of God, or doubt of his Word, our <HI>Sacrifices</HI> are little worth; but if we <HI>trust</HI> stedfastly in God, our <HI>Sacrifices</HI> will be good.</P>
<P>Once more, what <HI>Sacrifices</HI> must <HI>we</HI> offer. My Answer is, we must offer such as <HI>Abraham</HI> offered. And what a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> was that? we are told in Gen. 22.12. <HI>Now I know that thou fearest me, seeing thou hast not with hel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thy Son, thy only Son from me.</HI> It seems, he had but one
<PB N="119" REF="64"/> dearly beloved <HI>Son,</HI> and he offered that <HI>Son</HI> to God; and so God said, <HI>I know thou fearest me!</HI> Behold, a Sacrifice in Deed and in Truth such an one must <HI>we</HI> offer. Only, God re∣quires not us to Sacrifice our <HI>Sons,</HI> but our <HI>Sins;</HI> our dearest <HI>Sins.</HI> God calls us this day to part with all our <HI>Sins,</HI> tho' never so beloved; and we must not with-hold any of them from him. If we will not part with <HI>All,</HI> the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> is not right. Let us part with such Sins as we <HI>love best,</HI> and it will be a good <HI>Sacrifice!</HI></P>
<P><HI>God smelt a sweet savour in</HI> Noahs <HI>Sacrifice;</HI> and so will God receive our Sacrifices, when we Worship him aright. But how did God manifest his Acceptance of <HI>Noahs</HI> Offering: 'twas by promising to <HI>Drown</HI> the world no more, but give us <HI>Fruitful Seasons.</HI> God has chastised us of late, as if he would utterly <HI>Drown</HI> us; and he has <HI>Drowned</HI> and Spoiled and Ru∣in'd a great deal of our hay, and threatens, to kill our Cattel. 'Tis for this that we <HI>Fast</HI> and <HI>Pray</HI> this Day. Let us then Offer a clean and pure Sacrifice, as <HI>Noah</HI> did; so God will smell a favour of Rest, and he will with-hold the <HI>Rain,</HI> and Bless us with such <HI>Fruitful Sea∣sons</HI> as we are desiring of him.</P></Q>

Even the <HI>Christmas-Festival</HI> it self, he knew to be a stranger unto the Apos∣tolical Times; that the exquisite <HI>Vossius</HI> himself acknowledges, 'twas not Celebrated in the first or second Century: and that there is a Truth in the words of the great <HI>Chemnuius, Anni∣versarium Diem Natales Christi, celebratum fuisse, apud ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stissimos nunquam legitur.</HI> He knew that if the <HI>Day of our Lords Nativity</HI> were to be observed, it should not be in <HI>December:</HI> that many Churches for divers Ages kept it not in <HI>December,</HI> but in <HI>January;</HI> that <HI>Chrysostom</HI> himself, about four hundred years after our Saviour, excuses the Novelty of the <HI>December</HI> season for it, and confesses it had not been kept above ten years at <HI>Constantinople:</HI> No, that it should be rather in <HI>September,</HI> in which Month the <HI>Jews</HI> kept the <HI>Feast</HI> that was a <HI>Type</HI> of our Lords Incarnation; and <HI>Solomon</HI> also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rought the <HI>Ark</HI> into the Temple; for our Lord wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>thirty years,</HI> old when he entred upon his publick Ministry; and he continu∣ed in it <HI>three years and an half;</HI> Now his Death was in <HI>March,</HI> and it is easy then to calculate when his Birth ought to be. He knew, that indeed God had <HI>hid</HI> this Day as he
<PB N="121" REF="65"/> did the body of <HI>Moses,</HI> to prevent <HI>Idolatry;</HI> but that <HI>Antichrist</HI> had <HI>chose</HI> this day, to ac∣commodate the Pagans in their Licencious and their Debauched <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>turn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lia;</HI> and that a <HI>Tertul∣lian</HI> would not stick to say, <HI>Shall we Christians who have nothing to do with the Festivals of the</HI> Jews, <HI>which were once of Divine Institution, em∣brace the</HI> Saturnalia, <HI>of the Heathen? How do the</HI> Gentiles <HI>shame us, who are more true to their Religion, than we are to ours? None of them will observe the Lords-day, for fear lest they should be</HI> Christians; <HI>and shall not we then by observing their Festivals, fear lest we be made</HI> Ethnicks? In fine, it was his opinion, That for us to have stated Holy Days which are not appointed by the Lord Jesus Christ, is a deep Reflection upon the Wisdom of that glorious Lord; and he brought up his <HI>Indians,</HI> in the principles which the old <HI>Waldenses</HI> had about such unwar∣rantable <HI>Holydays.</HI></P>
<P>Nevertheless, he taught them to set apart their <HI>Days</HI> both for <HI>Fasting</HI> and <HI>Prayer,</HI> and for <HI>Feasting</HI> and <HI>Praise,</HI> when there should be <HI>Ex∣traordinary Occasions</HI> for them; and they perform the duties of these Days with a very laborious Piety. One party of the Indians long since of their own Accord, kept a <HI>Day of Supplication,</HI> to∣gether, wherein one of them discoursed upon Psal, 66.7. <HI>He Rules by his power for ever, His Eyes behold the Nations, let not the Rebellious ex∣alt themselves.</HI> And when one asked them after∣wards,
<PB N="122" REF="66"/> what was the Reason of their keeping such a day, they reply'd, <HI>It was to obtain five mercies of God.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">First, That God would slay the Rebellion of their hearts. Next, that they might love God and one another. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rdly, that they might withstand the Temptations of wicked men, so that they might not be drawn back, from God Fourthly, that they might be Obedient unto the counsils and commands of their Ru∣lers. Fifthly, that they might have their sins done away by the Redemption of Jesus Christ; And lastly, that they might walk in the good wayes of the Lord.</Q> I must here embrace my opportunity to tell the world, that our Cauti∣ous <HI>Eliot,</HI> was far from the opinion of those who have thought it not only warrantable, but also commendable to <HI>Adopt</HI> some Heathenish Usages into the Worship of God, for the more easy and speedy gaining of the Heathen to that Worship. The policy of treating the <HI>Paegan Rites</HI> as the Jews were to do <HI>Captives,</HI> before they married them, to shave their <HI>Hair,</HI> and pare their <HI>Nails,</HI> our <HI>Eliot</HI> counted as <HI>ridiculous</HI> as <HI>pernicious.</HI> He knew that the Idolatries and Abominations of <HI>Popery,</HI> were founded, in thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> way of <HI>Prosely<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing</HI> the barbarous Nations, which made their Descent upon the <HI>Roman Empire</HI> and he look'd upon the like methods which the <HI>Protestants</HI> have used, that they might ingrati∣ate
<PB N="123" REF="66"/> themselves with the <HI>Papists,</HI> and that our Separation from them should become the less <HI>dangerous</HI> and <HI>sensible,</HI> to be the most <HI>sensible</HI> and <HI>dangerous</HI> wound of the Reformation. Wherefore, as no less a man than Dr. <HI>Henry Moor</HI> says about our Compliances with the <HI>Pa∣pists,</HI> which are a sort of <HI>Pagans, Their Conversi∣on and Salvation being not to be compassed by need∣less Symbolizing with them, in any thing, I con∣ceive our best policy is studiously to imitate them in nothing; but for all indifferent things, to think rather the worse of them for their using of them. As no person of Honour, would willingly go in the known Garb of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>famous persons. Whatsoever we Court them in, they do but turn it to our scorn and contemp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, &amp; are the more hardened in their own wickedness.</HI> To act upon this principle, is the design and glory of <HI>New-England!</HI> And our <HI>Eliot</HI> was of this perswasion, when he brought his <HI>Indians</HI> to a <HI>pure, plain, Scripture Worship.</HI> He would not gratify them with a <HI>Samaritan</HI> sort of blended, mixed Worship; and he ima∣gined, as we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l he might, that the Apostle <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aul</HI>'s first Epistle to the <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rinthians</HI> had enough in it, for-ever to deter us all from such Unchristian and unhappy <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emporizing.</HI></P>

<P>IT is to be confessed, That the <HI>Roman Catho∣licks</HI> have a <HI>Clergy</HI> so very Numerous, and so little Encumbred, and are Masters of such pro∣digious Ecclesiastical <HI>Revenues,</HI> as renders it ve∣ry easy for them to exceed the <HI>Protestants</HI> in their Endeavours to Christianize the Pagan Sal∣vages. Nor would I <HI>Reproach,</HI> but rather <HI>Ap∣plaud</HI> their <HI>Industry</HI> in this matter, wishing that we were all touched with an <HI>Emulation</HI> of it. Nevertheless, while I commend their <HI>Industry,</HI> they do by their Clamours against the Reform∣ed Churches upon this account, oblige me to tax divers very scandalous things in the <HI>Missi∣ons</HI> which they make <HI>pro propaganda side</HI> through∣out the world; and therewithal to compare what has been <HI>done</HI> by that little Handful of Reformed Churches in this Country, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch has in divers Regards <HI>out-dyie</HI> the furthest Efforts of popery.</P>
<P>The <HI>Attainments</HI> which with Gods help we have carried up our <HI>Indi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns</HI> unto, are the chief Honour and Glory of our Labours with them.

Now, to deale plainly with you, there are two <HI>Vices,</HI> which many of you are too
<PB N="134" REF="72"/> prone unto, and which are utterly inconsistent with a <HI>True Christianity.</HI> One of those Vices, is that of <HI>Idleness.</HI> If you had a Disposition to follow an <HI>Honest Calling,</HI> what should hinder you from growing as Considerable in your E∣states, as many of your <HI>English Neighbours</HI> whereas, you are now poor, mean, ragged, star∣ved, contemptible and miserable; and instead of being able, as your <HI>English Neighbours</HI> do, to support the ordinances of God, you are behol∣den to <HI>them,</HI> not only for maintaining of those Blessed ordinances among you, but for many o∣ther kindnesses.

<HEAD>The CONCLUSION. Or, <HI>ELIOT</HI> Expiring.</HEAD>
<P>BY this time, I have doubtless made my Rea∣ders loth to have me tell what now remains of this little History; doubtless they are wishing that this <HI>John</HI> might have <HI>Tarried until the Se∣cond Coming of our Lord.</HI> But, alas All-Devou∣ring <HI>Death</HI> at last snatch'd him from us, and slighted all those Lamentations of ours, <HI>My Fa∣ther, My Father, the Chariots of Israel, and the Horsemen there f!</HI></P>
<P>When he was become a sort of <HI>Miles Emeri∣tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> &amp; <HI>began</HI> to draw near <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s <HI>End,</HI> he grew still more Heavenly, more Savoury, more Divine, and Scented more of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>spicy</HI> Country, at which he was ready to put a shoar. As the Histo∣rian observes of <HI>Liberius.</HI> That when his <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Strength</HI> were going from him, his <HI>Vice</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et remained with him; on the contrary, the
<PB N="136" REF="73"/> <HI>Grace</HI> of this Excellent Man rather increased than abated, when every thing else was dying with him. 'Tis too usual with <HI>Old men,</HI> that when they are <HI>past work,</HI> they are least sensible of their inabilities and incapacities, and can scarce endure to see another succeeding them in any part of their Office. But our <HI>Eliot</HI> was of a Temper quite contrary thereunto; for finding many Months before his Expiration, That he had not strength enough to Edify his Congre∣gation with publick <HI>Prayers,</HI> and <HI>Sermons,</HI> he im∣portun'd his people with some impatience to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all another Minister; professing himself, una∣ble to Dy with Comfort, until he could see a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood Successor ordained, settled, fixed among them. For this cause, he also cry'd mightily unto the Lord Jesus, our <HI>Ascended Lord,</HI> that he would give such a <HI>Gift</HI> unto <HI>Roxbury,</HI> and he sometimes call'd his whole Town together to joyn with him in a <HI>East</HI> for su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h a blessing. As the return of their Supplications, our Lord quickly bestow'd upon them, a person <HI>young</HI> in years, but <HI>old</HI> in Discretion, Gravity, and Experience; and one whom the Church of <HI>Roxbury</HI> hopes to find, <HI>A Pastor after God's own Heart.</HI></P>
<P>It was Mr. <HI>Nehemiah Walter,</HI> who being by the unanimous Vote and Choice of the Church there, become the <HI>Pastor</HI> of <HI>Roxbury,</HI> immediate∣ly found the Venerable <HI>Eliot</HI> Embracing &amp; Che∣rishing of him, with the tender Affections of a
<PB N="137" REF="73"/> <HI>Father.</HI> The good Old Man like Old <HI>Aaron</HI> as it were disrobed himself, with an unspeakable satisfaction, when he beheld his garments put upon a son so dear unto him. After this, he for a year or two before his Translation, could scarce be perswaded unto any publick Service, but humbly pleaded, what none but <HI>he</HI> would ever have said, <HI>It would be a wrong to the Souls of the people, for him to do any thing among them, when they were supply'd so much to their Advantage otherwise.</HI> If I mistake not, the Last that even he Preached was on a Publick <HI>East;</HI> when he fed his people with a very distinct, and useful, <HI>Exposition</HI> upon the Eighty Third Psalm; and he concluded with an Apology, begging his Hearers to pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>don the <HI>poorness,</HI> and <HI>meanness,</HI> and <HI>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>okenness,</HI> (as he called it) of his Medita∣tions; but added he, <HI>My dear Brother here, will by'nd by mend all.</HI></P>
<P>But altho' he thus dismissed himself as one so near to the Age of <HI>Ninety,</HI> might well have done, from his publick Labours; yet he would not give over his Endeavours, in a more pri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate Sphaere, to <HI>Do good unto all.</HI> He had al∣wayes been an Enemy to <HI>Idleness;</HI> any one that should look into the little <HI>Diary</HI> that he kept in his <HI>Almanalks,</HI> would see that there was with him, <HI>No day without a Line;</HI> he was troub∣led when he saw how much <HI>Time</HI> was devoured by that slavery to <HI>Tobacco,</HI> which too many de∣base themselves unto, and now he grew old,
<PB N="138" REF="74"/> he was desirous that his <HI>work</HI> should hold pace with his <HI>Life;</HI> the less <HI>Time</HI> he saw <HI>left,</HI> the less was he willing to have <HI>lost.</HI> He imagined that he could now <HI>do nothing</HI> to any purpose in any Service for God; and sometimes he would say with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Air peculiar to himself, <HI>I wonder for what the L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd Jesus Christ lets me live; he knows that ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> I can do nothing for him!</HI> And yet he could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot forbear Essaying to <HI>Do something</HI> for his dearest Lord; wheref<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, thought he, <HI>What shall I do?</HI> And he then co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceived, that tho' the <HI>English</HI> could not be benefi ed by any Gifts which he now fancied himself to have only the <HI>Ruines</HI> of, yet who can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell but the <HI>Negro</HI>'s might! He had long lamented it with a bleed∣ing and a burning passion, that the <HI>English</HI> used their <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gro</HI>'s but as their <HI>Horses</HI> or their <HI>Oxen,</HI> and that so little care was taken about their prec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous and immortal Souls; he look d upon it as a prodigy, that any wearing the <HI>Name</HI> of <HI>Christians,</HI> should so much have the <HI>Heart</HI> of <HI>Devils</HI> in them, as to prevent and hinder the Instruction of the poor <HI>Blackanu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>res,</HI> and con∣fine the Souls of their miserable Slaves to a <HI>de∣stroying ignorance,</HI> meerly for fear of thereby loosing the benefit of their Vassalage; but now he made a mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on to the <HI>English</HI> within two or three miles of him that at such a time and place they would send their <HI>Negro</HI>'s once a week unto him: for he would then <HI>Catechise</HI> them, and <HI>Enlighten</HI> them to the utmost of his
<PB N="139" REF="74"/> power in the Things of their Everlasting Peace; however, he did not live to make much pro∣gress in this Undertaking.</P>
<P>At length, when he was able to do <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le</HI> without doors, he try'd then to do something <HI>within;</HI> and <HI>one thing</HI> was this. A young Boy in the Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghbourhood, had in his infancy fal∣len into a fire, so as to burn himself into a perfect <HI>Blindness;</HI> but this Boy being now grown to some Bigness, the good old man took him home to his house, with some intentions to make a <HI>scholar</HI> of him. He first informed him of and from the <HI>Scripture,</HI> in wich the Boy so profited, that in a little time he could, even Repeat many whole <HI>Chapters</HI> Verbatim, and if any other in Reading missed a word, he would mind them of it; yea, and an ordinary piece of latin wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> become easy to the lad; but having his own <HI>Eye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> clos d by Death, he could no longer help the poor Child against the want of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, As the Aged <HI>Polycarp</HI> could say, <HI>These Eighty Six years have I se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved my Lord J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sus Christ; and he has been such a good Master in me all this while, that I will not now forsake h m</HI> Such a <HI>Polycarp</HI> was our <HI>Eliot;</HI> he had been so many years engaged in the sweet ser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice of his dear Jesus, that he could not now give it over: 'twas his Ambition, and his priviledge, <HI>to bring forth Fruit in old Age;</HI> and what veneration the Church of <HI>Smyrna</HI> paid unto that <HI>Angel</HI> of theirs,
<PB N="140" REF="75"/> we were upon the like Accounts willing to give unto <HI>this Man of God.</HI></P>
<P>While he was, thus making his <HI>Retreat</HI> out of this evil world, his Discourses from time to time ran upon, <HI>The Coming of the Lord Jesus Christ;</HI> it was the Theme which he still had Recourse unto, and we were sure to have some∣thing of <HI>this,</HI> whatever other Subject he were upon. On <HI>this</HI> he talk d, of <HI>this</HI> he pray'd, for <HI>this</HI> he long'd, and especially when any bad News arriv'd, his usual reflection thereupon would be, <HI>Behold, some of the Clouds, in which we must look for the Coming of the Son of Man.</HI> At last, his Lord, for whom he had been long wishing, <HI>Lord, come! I have been a great while ready for thy Coming!</HI> at last, I say, his Lord <HI>came,</HI> and fetched him away into the <HI>Joy of his Lord.</HI></P>
<P>He fell into some Languishments, attended with a <HI>Fever,</HI> which in a few days brought him into the <HI>Pangs</HI> (may I say? or <HI>Joyes</HI>) of Death, and while he lay in these, Mr. <HI>Walter</HI> coming to him, he said unto him, <HI>brother, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hou art wel∣come to my very Soul. Pray, Retire to thy Study for me, and give me leave to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e gone;</HI> meaning that he should not, by Petitions to Heaven for his Life, detain him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here. It was in these Lan∣guishments, that speaking about the work of the Gospel among the <HI>Ind ans,</HI> he did after this Heavenly manner express himself, <HI>There is a Cloud</HI> (said he) <HI>a dark cloud upon the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rk of
<PB REF="75"/> the Gospel among the poor Indians. The Lord Re∣vive and prosper that work, and grant it may live when I am Dead. It is a work, which I have been</HI> Doing <HI>much and long about. But what was the word I spoke last? I Recal that word,</HI> My Doings! <HI>Alas, they have been poor and small and lean Do∣ings, and I'le be the man that shall throw the first stone at them all.</HI></P>
<P>It has been observed, that they who have spoke many considerable things in their <HI>lives,</HI> usually speak few at their <HI>deaths.</HI> But it was otherwise with our <HI>Eliot,</HI> who after much Speech of and for God in his <HI>Life-time,</HI> uttered some things little short of <HI>Oracles</HI> on his <HI>Death-Bed;</HI> which, 'tis a thousand pities, they were not more exactly regarded and recorded. Those Authors that have taken the pains to Collect, <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gmata Morientium,</HI> have not therein been unserviceable to the Living; but the <HI>Apophtheg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms</HI> of a Dying <HI>Eliot</HI> must have had in them a <HI>grace</HI> &amp; a <HI>strain</HI> truly extraordina∣ry; and indeed the <HI>vulgar Error</HI> of the signal sweetness in the Song of a <HI>Dying Swan,</HI> was a very <HI>Truth</HI> in our Expiring <HI>Eliot;</HI> his last Breath smelt strong of Heaven, and was Arti∣cled into none but very gracious Notes; one of the last whereof, was, <HI>Welcome Joy!</HI> and at last it went away calling upon the slanders by, to, <HI>Pray, pray, pray!</HI> which was the Thing in which so vast a portion of it, had been before Employ'd.</P>
<PB N="142" REF="76"/>
<P>This was the <HI>peace,</HI> in the <HI>end</HI> of this <HI>Perfect and upright man;</HI> thus was there another <HI>Star</HI> fetched away to be placed among the Rest that the third Heaven is now enriched with.

<Q>A Facie Hostili duo propugnacula praesunt.</Q></P>
<P>If the Dust of <HI>dead Saints</HI> could give us any protection, we are not without it; here is a Spot of <HI>American</HI> Soyl that will afford a rich Crop of it, at the <HI>Resurrection of the Just.</HI> Poor <HI>New-England</HI> has been as <HI>Glastenbury</HI> of old was called, <HI>A Burying-place of Saints.</HI> But we cannot see a more terrible Prognostick, than Tombs filling apace with such <HI>Bones,</HI> as those of the Renowned <HI>Eliot</HI>'s; the whole Building of this Country trembles at the Fall of such a Pillar.</P>
<P>For many Months before, he dy'd, he would often chearfully tell us, <Q REND="margQuotes">That he was shortly going to Heaven and that he would carry a deal of good News thither with him; <HI>he
<PB N="144" REF="77"/> said,</HI> He vvould carry Tidings to the Old-Founders of <HI>New-England,</HI> which were now in Glory, that Church-work was yet carried on among us: that the Number of our Chur∣ches was continually encreasing: and that the Churches were still kept as big as they were, by the daily Additions of those that shall be sa∣ved.</Q> But the going of such as <HI>he</HI> from us, will apace diminish the occasions of such happy Tidings.</P>
<P>What shall we now say? Our <HI>Eliot</HI> himself used most affectionately to bewayl the Death of all Useful Men; yet if one brought him the notice of such a thing, with any Despondencies, or said, <HI>O Sir, such an one is Dead, what shall we, do?</HI> he would answer, <HI>Well, but God lives, Christ lives, the Old Saviour of</HI> New-England <HI>yet lives, and He will Reign till all his Enemies are made his Footstool.</HI> This, and only this, consideration have we to relieve us; and let it be accompa∣nied with our Addresses to the <HI>God of the Spirits of all Flesh,</HI> That there may be <HI>Timothies</HI> raised up in the room of our Departed <HI>Pauls;</HI> &amp; that when our <HI>Moses</HI>'s are gone, the Spirit which which was in those brave men, may be put up∣on the surviving <HI>Elders of our Israel.</HI></P>
<P>The last thing, that ever our <HI>Eliot</HI> put off, was, <HI>The care of all the Churches,</HI> which with a most Apostolical and Evangelical Temper he was continually solicitous about. When the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> were under a very
<PB N="145" REF="77"/> uncomfortable prospect, by the advantage which men that sought the Ruine, of those golden and holy and Reformed Societies, had obtained a∣gainst them. God put it into the heart of o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e well-known in these Churches, to take a Voyage into <HI>England,</HI> that he might by his Mediations at <HI>Whitehal,</HI> di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ert the <HI>Storms</HI> that were im∣pending over us.

<P>May the poor <HI>Greeks, Armentans, Muscovites,</HI> and others, in the Eastern Countrys, wearing the Name of <HI>Christians,</HI> that have little <HI>Preach∣ing</HI> and no <HI>Printing,</HI> and few Bibles, or good Books, now at last be furnished with Bibles, Or∣thodox Catechisms, and Pra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tical Treatises by the Charity of <HI>England;</HI> and may our Presses provide good stores of good Books for them, in their own Tongues, to be scattered among them.

<P>May sufficient Numbers of great, wise, rich, learned, and godly men in the three kingdomes, procure well-composed <HI>Socie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies,</HI> by whose united counsels, the Noble Design of <HI>Evangelizing</HI> the world, may be more effectually carried on; and if some generous persons will of their own Accord combine for such consultations, who can tell, but like some other <HI>Celebrated Societies</HI> heretofore formed from such small Beginnings,
<PB N="151" REF="80"/> they may soon have that countenance of Authori∣ty, which may produce very glorious Effects, and give opportunity to gather vast <HI>Contributions</HI> from all well disposed people, to Assist and Advance this progress of Christianity. God forbid, that <HI>popery</HI> should expend upon <HI>cheating,</HI> more than ten times what <HI>we</HI> do upon <HI>Saving,</HI> the Immortal Souls of men.</P>
<P>Lastly, May many worthy men, who find their circumstances will allow of it, get the <HI>Language</HI> of some Nations that are not yet brought home to God; and wait upon the Divine Providence, for Gods <HI>Leading</HI> them to, and <HI>Owning</HI> them in, their <HI>Apostolical undertakings.</HI> When they Re∣member what <HI>Ruffinus</HI> relates concerning the con∣version of the <HI>Iberians,</HI> and what <HI>Socrates,</HI> with o∣ther Authors, relates concerning, the conversion wrought by occasion of <HI>Frumentius</HI> &amp; <HI>Aedesius,</HI> in the <HI>Inner India,</HI> all as it were by <HI>Accident,</HI> surely twil make them Try, wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may be done by <HI>De∣sign</HI> for such things now in our Days! Thus, let them see, whether while <HI>we</HI> at home in the midst of wearisome Temptations, are Angling with <HI>Rods,</HI> which now and then catch one Soul for our Lord, they shall not be Fishing with <HI>Nets,</HI> which will bring in many thousands of those, concerning whom with <HI>unspeakable Joy</HI> in the Day of the Lord, they may say, <HI>Behold, I and the Children which God has given me!</HI> Let them see, whether, supposing they should pros∣per no farther than to <HI>Preach the Gospel of the

<P>Let no man be discouraged by the <HI>Difficulties,</HI> which the Devil will be ready to clog such At∣tempts against his Kingdome with; for I will take leave so to Translate the words of the wise man, in <HI>Prov.</HI> 27.4. <HI>what is able to stand before ZEAL?</HI> I am well satisfy'd, that if men had the Wisdom, <HI>To discern the Signs of the Times,</HI> they would be all Hands at Work, to spread the Name of our JESUS into all the Corners of the Earth. <HI>Grant it, O my God; and Lord Jesus, Come Quickly.</HI></P>
