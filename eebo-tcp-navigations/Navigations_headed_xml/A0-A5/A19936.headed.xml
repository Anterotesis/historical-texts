<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Departed out of <HI>England</HI> the 28. of <HI>Ianuarie 1597.</HI> in the good ship named the <HI>Francis</HI> of Saltash, in the countie of of <HI>Cornwell,</HI> Master <HI>Tyball Geare,</HI> Owner, and <HI>William Lewellyn,</HI> Master of her, being laden with Fish, and He∣rings, and such like commodities, then bound for the <HI>Strayts</HI> and to arriue at <HI>Ciuita de Vecchia</HI> to the will and plea∣sure of God: where we arriued the sixt day of <HI>March</HI> insuing, whose description followeth by me <HI>William Dauies</HI> Barber-Surgion of <HI>London,</HI> and borne in the Citie of <HI>Heriford.</HI></P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="description">
<HEAD>I. The Description of <HI>Ciuita de Vecchia.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>CIuita de Vecchia</HI> is an ancient Citie of the Popes, lying<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distant from England leagues 700.</NOTE> in low ground, a dayes iourney from <HI>Rome</HI> by land, this City lieth close vpon the Sea, very strongly fortified, and plan∣ted with Ordinance, to the East side a strong Castle, or Fort: And also the like vpon the West side, in this place the Popes Gallies lie, and shipping. For there is a harbour, and fayre mould for their safetie. For the Pope hath no other place for Ships or Gallies but <HI>Rome,</HI> and there none will come vp but small Barkes, and Boates, and such like, by reason of the shal∣lownesse of the Riuer. In this <HI>Ciuita de Vecchia</HI> are altoge∣ther


<PB REF="6"/>
Romanes, wholly professing the Romish Religion, saying directly that the Pope is God an earth, and that he can forgiue any sinne whatsoeuer being committed, which makes the most part of them, or all, runne desperately into most deadly sinnes.</P>
<P>For very Murther they hold it no great sinne, being commit∣ted, receiuing of the Popes pardon, or else getting into some Monasterie where they may be confessed, and absolued, where∣by no Law can take hold of them at their comming forth, be∣ing apt and readie within a wéeke, or fortnight after to commit the like Murther, then receiuing the like pardon, or absolution, as before they had done: and thus many bloodie minded men continue their life-time, for it is an easie matter for a man to haue his aduersarie kild, or poysoned for money, although his executioner neuer sée him till such time as he committeth this bloudie déed, being hired by another.</P>
<P>Also in this Countrey their women are very lewde and wicked, for euen in that ancient Citie of Rome, there are many thousands of lewd liuing women that pay monethly vnto the Pope for the sinnefull vse of their wicked bodies: some pay sixe Crownes a moneth, and so from sixe Crownes to one, for they are rated according to their outward shew, and for the no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-payment of this monethly pay, they shall haue their goods strained and carried out of their houses, or chambers, by the Popes officers, and kept from them till such time as satisfaction is made to the Pope. So it is lawfull for any man to vse any of these women as his owne wife, neither shall he be molested or troubled, or otherwise indangered, so he escape secret occasions of danger, for this woman will be as dutifull vnto him as his seruant, alwaies attending his plea∣sure for his diet or any thing else belonging vnto him: he gi∣uing her content with his purse; but she not receiuing content may as lawfully arrest him, and cast him into prison till such time as she doth receiue satisfaction, being recouered by Law: for they hold their liuings by the Pope.</P>
<P>Now as I haue spoken of two deadly sinnes wherein they excéed, so will I speake of one thing wherein some of them are to be commended, that is this. If there be any Christian, of


<PB REF="6"/>
what Nation soeuer, poore and in distresse, making his case knowne, and asking for Christs sake, he shall be relieued, with all those necessaries whereof he is destitute, as apparrell, meat, and drinke, and some money, though it be but little: if he be sicke, then shall he be put into an Hospitall, where he shall be cho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sely attended vpon, hauing good lodging, dai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tie diet, and comfortable Phisicke for the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>storing of his health, whether he be Papist or Protestant: but if he be a Papist, he shall be the better vsed, and if he be a Protestant they will vse all meanes they can to conuert him, but force him to nothing at all. In these Countries it is dangerous for an Englishman being a Protestant to speake any thing against the Pope, or his Religion, especially vnto another Englishman that is a Papist, yet this English Papist will séeke all the meanes pos∣sible to intrappe the Protestant, and will speake ill words of himselfe, to draw him to the like, but when he hath made him vtter the secrets of his heart, then will he make it knowne, and more then the Protestant spake, to some chiefe man of a Church, by whom he shall be forced to alter his Religion, or to be burned, or put in some secret prison where he shall be starued to death, and this is the manner and fashion in all Countries of Christendome within the Popes Jurisdiction, not onely of the treacherie of the English Papists, but also of the other deadly sinnes which I touched before, as their mur∣ther and adultry: and in like manner of their generall com∣passion, to a distressed Christian. What I haue héere writ∣ten, I speake not of heare-say, nor by imaignation, but directly haue séene, and of mine owne knowledge you may speake it, being too long a time amongst them, against my will.</P>

and platformes, with great store of Ordinance planted about it, also there are many Gallies belonging to this place, which doe much offend the Christians, in taking of their ships, <HI>Tar∣tanes</HI> and <HI>Satties,</HI> and other small vessels, making all the Chri∣stians that they take slaues, &amp; selling of them in their markets like horses: for according to age and strength they are prised. This Citie is gouerned by a King, being vassall to the great Turke. Also there are great store of Janizaries in it, to the number of 20. or 30000. at one time: these Ianizaries are chiefe Souldiers, and gouerned by a Dane, which is a generall vn∣der the great Turke. These Turks are goodly people of par∣son, and of a very faire complexion, but very villains in minde, for they are altogether Sodomites, and doe all things contra∣rie to a Christian. For they doe neuer lye in a bed, nor féede vpon a Table; yet their féeding and diet is very plentifull, their bedding and apparrell is very neat and costly, the manner of their lodging is thus: There is a very faire table in a roome, about thrée yards in breadth, and as many in length standing in height one yard from the ground, and thereon they vse to spread a double quilt very costly with many curious Cushions, in stead of Pillowes, whereon he lieth downe in his shirt, and linnen britches onely, without any other couering, by reason of the heat of the countrey. Also in the same roome he hath ano∣ther Table laid after the same fashion very richly, whereon his wiues doe lie, but she that likes him best, he will take to ac∣company him for the night. A Turke may haue as many wiues as he pleaseth, so he be able to buy them, and by the number of his wiues, most commonly his substance is knowne, for the richer he is, the more wiues he hath, the poorer the fewer: yet neuer married to none of them, but onely the first, but maintai∣ning of them all. It is very dangerous for a Christian to be found in the company of any Turkes woman, for being found together, he shall be forced to turne Turke, or else be put to death, and the said woman also shall be put into a sacke, which being made fast, she shall be flung into the Sea, whether they commit the sinne or not. These Turkes are very zealous in their religion, acknowledging God; and <HI>Mahomet</HI> a soliciter


<PB REF="7"/>
for their sinnes. A Turke will kéepe his word if he sweares by his head, putting his hand vpon his forehead. In this coun∣trey there is great store of gold and rich Marchants; the man∣ner of their Churches and comming to Prayer is thus. The Church is very faire within, with many hundreds of Lampes burning therein, all matted vnder foote, without any kinde of picture, or seats, also most of them doe pray vpon Beads. In the morning on the top of the Church they hang out a white flag, and in the after noone a blew one for a signe of their com∣ming to Church, then goeth eight or tenne of them on the very top of the Church, and crie with a loud voice. <HI>Volla, volla hamdrulla</HI> and <HI>shalla,</HI> that is to say God, God, helpe vs at thy pleasure, and this is their ordinary warning to come to Church, as we vse Bels in Christendome, for they abhorre the ringing of Bels, being contrary to their Prophets command.</P>
<P>A Turke chooseth his first wife after this maner. He neuer séeth his wife till she come to the Church to be maried, for the match is made by their friends, neither is a Turkish womans face to be séene, because their faces are continually couered going through the stréets, both young and old: neither shall a man∣childe after he is tenne yeeres old euer sée his mother. A Turke is Circumcised after this manner. The better Gen∣tleman he is, the longer he stayes afore he be Circumcised, but the time being come, then is he put vpon a very faire white horse, being very costly attired, and before him goeth two, or three hundreth by two and two in purple coates, bearing waxe candles in their hands, and after them followeth a great ma∣ny playing on diffused Instruments making of a great noise, then followeth a Bull couered with very faire Arras, and his hornes gilded, and next rideth he that shall be Circumcised, with all his friends following, and thus he rideth to the place of Circumcision, where they cut off the foresa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne of his yard, naming of him <HI>Morat, Shebane,</HI> or <HI>Hosan,</HI> or some such like name: then will they take the Bull, and turne his head to to the East-ward, then cut his throat, saying, this day wee haue done a good déed, then they cut the Bull in yeeces, and di∣stribute it among his friends, and kindred, and so they re∣turne


<PB REF="8"/>
home where they doe feast with great ioy.</P>
<P>The manner of a Christian turning Turke, is thus. He is put vpon a horse with his face towards the tayle, and a Bow and an Arrow in his hand, then the picture of Christ is car∣ried before him with his feete vpwards, at the which he drawes his Bow with the Arrow therein, and thus he rideth to the place of Circumcision, cursing his father that begate him, and and his mother that bore him, his Country, and all his kindred: then comming to the place of Circumcision, he is Circumcised, receiuing a name, &amp; denying his Christian name, so that euer after he is called a <HI>Runagado,</HI> that is, a Christian denying Christ and turned Turke: of which sort there are more in Turkie and Barbary then of naturall Turkes. The manner of their iudgement for offending of the Law touching death, eyther for theft or murther, is thus: within foure houres after he is taken, he is condemned by certaine chiefe Souldiers, and presently put to death after this manner, <HI>viz.</HI> ganshed, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aked or beat to death. Their ganshing is after this manner: He sitteth vpon a wall, being fiue fadomes high, within two fadomes of the top of the wall, right vnder the place where he sits, is a strong Iron hooke fastned, being very sharpe, then is he thrust off the wall vpon this hooke with some part of his bodie, and there he hangeth sometimes two or thrée daies before he dieth. Staking to death is thus: Around péece of wood thrée yards long, and as big as a mans leg, being sharpe at one end, is ta∣ken and driuen in at the fundament of the offender, and out at his shoulder, and so they let him lie till he be dead, which some∣times will not be in a day or two. The manner of beating to death is thus: They take the offender, and lay him down vpon his backe, being naked, and with two double ropes, two seuerall men, one on the one side, and the other on the other side of him, beate on his belly till he is dead. But these deaths are very seldome vsed, because they are so fearefull to the offen∣ders, yet I haue séene them all executed.</P>

<P>The Moores of this Countrey are altogether in Religion like to the Turkes, and also in habite: they are verie light of foote, and gallant horsemen: they cannot indure Hogs flesh, nor the drinking of Wine, for they drinke water altogether, except it be sometimes <HI>Aqua-vitae.</HI> The manner of their liuing in the Countrey is thus: They will goe fiue or sixe hun∣dred together, Men, Women, and Children, with their Cam∣mels, Asses, and Shéepe, together with all their Poultrie, vn∣der the side of a Mountaine, where euery man pitcheth his Tent, liuing euery man to himselfe, hauing his Wife and Chil∣dren about him, with his Seruants and Cattell, thus many Tents are pitched together, to the bignesse of a little Towne, continuing there till such time as their Cattell haue eaten vp the grasse, and then being able to stay there no longer, they remooue to another place, where they liue as before they had done: and thus they doe spend their liues. By reason the Countrey is continually hotte, their féeding is plentifull, but their apparrell poore and bare, neyther haue they any, but what they buy with the increase of their Cattell, carrying them often to the Townes, Cities, and Market places néere, where they haue sale for them. These

Moores are very ingenious people, cunning and treacherous.</P>
<P>Now leaue we <HI>Tunys</HI> in the same Ship that I came out of <HI>England</HI> in, named the <HI>Francis</HI> of Sal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ash, being bound to <HI>Syo</HI> within the Arches of <HI>Archipelago,</HI> and fraighted with Tur∣kish goods by Turkes, and some Turks aboord with vs, for wée traded as well with the Turke as the Christian: but we had not sailed aboue foure leagues out of our Port in the night season, but that we were most fiercely set vpon by sixe of the Duke of <HI>Florence</HI> his Gallies, (who being in continuall warre with the Turke, tooke vs as a Turkish prize) which spit fire like diue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, to our great discomfort, but at length couraging of our selues in Gods mercies, we continued fight with them, to the losse of many a mans life of each fide, but all in vaine for vs, for they were fortie for one of vs, and our Sip torne downe to the water with their Ordinance, our mayne Mast, and mis∣sen Mast, shot by the boord, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e end of the Mast with all the sayles lying in the Sea, the other end aboord: thus were we taken, and stript euery man starke naked, and then were we distributed, some into one Gallie, and some into another▪ where we had as many Irons knocked vpon vs, and more, than then we were able to beare.

<PB REF="9"/>
Sea, also to this Towne doth belong a wilde road, and two very faire moulds for the safetie of the Dukes Gallies. In the entrance of these moulds is a very strong Castle with great store of Ordnance planted: also the Towne is very strongly fortified, for it is the chiefe garrison of the great Dukes, where is continually great store of Souldiers in pay. Which Souldiers are alwaies imployed in his shipping or Gallies, wherewith he doth more offend the Turke then all Christen∣dome, for they doe take Gallies and Carmizals and Brigan∣téens, and Townes of the Turkes and Moores: possessing of Men, Women, and Children, and selling them in Markets, like to Horses, Cowes, or Shéepe, reseruing the strongest for his owne flauery: In this place I liued eight yéeres, and ten moneths: thrée yéeres of this time I liued in this manner, from Sunne rising to Sunne set, chained in a Cart like a horse, re∣ceiuing more blowes then any Cart-horse in England, our diet being Bread and Water, and not so much Bread in thrée daies as we might haue eaten at once, thus we were vsed to goe fortie or fiftie Carts together, being all slaues: our la∣ding would be Sand, or Lyme, or Bricke, or some such like, and to draw it whither the Officers appointed vs, for their buildings. These Italians are very deceitfull people, for when they laugh in a mans face, they will séeke to kill him, yet they are very cowards being naturall Italians: their wo∣men are altogether wicked and lewde. Thrée yéeres being spent in this manner: all we English▪men were called as ma∣ny as were left aliue, making choise of the ablest of vs to goe into the Gallies, of which I was one chosen, then did my mise∣rie increase many-fold, for then I was made a Gally▪slaue to row at an Oare, where our former diet lessened▪ but blowes increased, to the losse of many of our liues. We were shauen Head and Beard euery eight or tenth day, being alwaies na∣ked, but onely a payre of linnen bréeches and chaines conti∣nually. In this time I was at the taking of many a Towne and Gally of the Turkes, though sore against my will, sée∣ing of many Cities, Ilands, and mayne Lands in the time of my slauerie, where I continued sixe yéeres a Gally-slaue,


<PB REF="10"/>
finding in all this time much comfort and reliefe from En∣glish Marchants that were Protestants, and also from ma∣ny English Masters and owners of Ships. But from En∣glish men being Papists none at all. The miserie of the Gal∣lies doth surpasse any mans iudgement or imagination, ney∣ther would any man thinke that such torture, or torment were vsed in the world, but onely they that féele it, the extrea∣mitie of miserie causeth many a slaue to kill themselues, or else séeke to kill their Officers; but we were not suffered to haue so much as a knife about vs, yea if we had gotten one by any extraordinarie meanes, and offered any violence to any Offi∣cer, we should presently haue lost our nose and eares, and recei∣ued a hundred blowes en our bare backe, and a hundred on our belly with a double rope, or a Buls pis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, continuing a slaue still: But I intreated the Almightie God to grant me grace that I might indure it patiently, that féeling that extreamitie in bodie in this world, how farre would the torments of hell haue surpassed and excéeded it, if I had in this my earthly tor∣ture béene accessary to mine owne death, as many were. But at length God of his great goodnesse and mercy, deliuered me (according to my hope) in this manner. The great Duke fit∣ted a ship▪ a Tartane and a <HI>Frigot,</HI> being very well appointed and victualled, dispesing of them into the West Indies, and chiefe∣ly for the Kiuer of the <HI>Amazons,</HI> appointing Captaine <HI>Robert Thornton,</HI> an Englishman to be chiefe Commaunder of the Ship, the <HI>Tartane</HI> and the <HI>Frigot:</HI> so likewise was euery other Officer appointed by the Duke himselfe; insomuch as spea∣king of the placing of a Phisition, a Surgion, and a Surgions mate, Captaine <HI>Thornton</HI> standing by, said, your Highnesse may doe well to deliuer a poore Englishman that hath con∣tinued a great while in your Gallies: hée is well experimanted in P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sicka, and Surgery, by reason of his long practise both by Sea an Land: he is hardned to the Sea, and able to dis∣charge the place better then the thrée before mentioned: for in the Gallies he doth your Highnes but the labour of one slaue: whereupon the Duke demaunded my name. Captaine <HI>Thorn∣ton</HI> answered, and said, <HI>William Dauies:</HI> whereto the Duke


<PB REF="10"/>
replied, I haue often béene spoken to for that fellow, whose liberty now I giue vpon thy good report, <HI>Thornton,</HI> but yet I doubt his vsage hath béene so hard in my Countrey, that as soone as hée is out of chaynes, he will giue me the slip and not goe the voyage into the In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies with thée. But if he can giue fiue hundred Crownes securitie to goe the voyage, hée shall be released presently out of chaynes: neyther shall hée want any thing that is needfull for the voyage, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the good of all the Company, or for his owne bodie, and this let him vn∣derstand as soone as may be: which newes came within two dayes vnto me, to my great reioycing &amp; comfort, but as soone as I heard it, I sodainly sate down, being at my ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> profession, car∣rying of durt, and stone, and such like in a basket, and would worke no longer, neyther suffer the slaue to worke that was chayned vnto mée, but as soone as I was espied, one of the Masters of the worke came to mée, and said thou Lutheran Dogge: Why workest thou not? and with that strake me with a Cudgell, whereto the slaue that was chayned with me, replied. The Duke hath giuen him his libertie: then said hée that had stroken mée, Master, I beseech you forgiue mée, and excuse my rashnesse, doubting that I should haue re∣membred his former courtesies being at libertie. And with∣in a short time after Captaine <HI>Thorneton</HI> came from <HI>Flo∣rence</HI> to <HI>Ligorne,</HI> where I was, who then tolde mee the Dukes disposition to the full, and vpon what securitie I should be deliuered: which securitie I did sodainely procure by an English Marchant, whose name was Maister <HI>Wil∣liam Mellyn,</HI> of <HI>Bristow,</HI> who passed his Band for fiue hun∣dred Crownes to the Duke, for the performance of the voy∣age by mée: Whereupon I was sodainely released out of chaynes, to my great reioycing, giuing God thankes for his blessings. Then was I presently well apparrelled by Cap∣taine <HI>Thorneton,</HI> and this Marchant, wanting nothing whereof I was destitute: But within two or three dayes after I was sent for, by the great Duke, to come vnto him to <HI>Archemeyne,</HI> where then hée continued, whither so∣daynely I repayred, and comming to the Dukes presence,


<PB REF="11"/>
doing my dutie, he said vnto me, be of good comfort I haue gi∣uen thée grace, with thy liberty, neyther shalt thou want any thing for the fitting of thy voyage, or néedful for thy owne bo∣die, therefore speake boldly, and demaund any thing that shall be necessary, and I will haue thée well fitted: for the great Duke of <HI>Florence</HI> wants no money. Then he demaunded of me further what I was in mine owne Countrey, whither I was a Gentleman or no. I answered his highnesse I was: then he asked me how? I told him my father was a Gentle∣man, and for my part I had serued my Quéene by Lano and by Sea, against the aduersaries of my Quéene and Coun∣trey, and had lost mine owne bloud, and spilt my enemies bloud: and next that I was a Gentleman by Art. Then the Duke answered and said: Thou art a worthy fellow, for thou hast indured much miserie in this world. But tell me, quoth hée, with what substance of wealth camest thou out of thy Countrey: I answered with two purses full: Full said hée, of what? I said of Siluer and Gold, which I lost when I was taken by his Highnes Gallies, and the other full of Patience, which doth continue full still: Then said the Duke to one that stoode by, giue him a hundred Crownes to spend to strengthen himselfe, and bring himselfe to courage; thus did the Duke take delight in discoursing with me, in respect I spake the I∣talian tongue very perfectly, for I bought it déere, with many a droppe of my bloud, in the time of my slauerie. Then receiuing this hundred Crownes, which the Duke had giuen me, I left his Court, comming presently to <HI>Ligorne,</HI> where the Ship lay, indeauoring of my selfe, by my labour, and industrie, for the fitting of all things necessary for the good of the Uoyage, vpon the Dukes charge, besides this hundred Crownes: for they were giuen mée to spend at my owne pleasure, which I did, to the comfort of many English-men that lay in chaines, that were taken with mée: they wanted neyther meate nor drinke as long as my money lasted, as many of them as were left a∣liue, for of seuen and thirtie of vs that were taken at the first, there remayned then but thirtéene, whereof tenne continued in chaines, and two were deliuered with me. By this time


<PB REF="11"/>
all things were prepared and made readie for the performance of our pretended Uoyage, now being bound to serue in the good Ship called the <HI>Santa Lucia,</HI> with a Frigot, and a Tartane, well victualled, and well manned, and chiefely bound to the Ri∣uer of <HI>Amazones,</HI> with other seuerall Riuers, the which the Duke would haue inhabited, hoping for great store of gaine of Gold, but the Countries did affoord no such thing, as here∣after shall be spoken of. Upon this Uoyage we were foure∣téene moneths, making little gaine, or benefit for the Duke, for there was nothing to be gained. Now are we homewards bound, and recouering the straits againe, &amp; being within three or foure dayes sayle of our owne Port, <HI>Ligorne:</HI> in the night season we met with an English Pirate, who would haue ta∣ken vs, but was not able, yet held vs fight all the whole night, and kild vs a man, and hurt other two: whereof one was an Englishman, who died within two dayes after we recouered <HI>Ligorne,</HI> and being dead I went to the Captaine and demaun∣ded of him where he should be buried, but he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad him goe aske of one father <HI>Sherwood</HI> an Englishman, so he told mée that if he were a Romane Catholike they would burie him in the Church, but if he were not, I should bury him out in the fields: But yet for my better assurance I went and asked of the Fri∣ers of the <HI>Misericordia,</HI> who also gaue their aduise, and coun∣sell that he should be buried in the fields, because he was no Romane Catholike, whereupon I buried him in this man∣ner.</P>
<P>I intreated the company of many Englishmen that were Protestants to helpe me to shroud him, and also to accompany me to the burying of him, which they did in this manner. We put him vpon a Beare, being shrowded with a couering ouer him, and carried by foure men, many Englishmen that were Protestants followed him, bearing euery man a branch of Rosemary in his hand to the place where we buried him, rea∣ding Prayers ouer him after the English manner. His name that was buried was <HI>Erasmus Lucas,</HI> and borne in <HI>Southwarke</HI> néere vnto <HI>London.</HI> Two daies being spent after his buriall, &amp; was sought for by an Italian Fryer, who finding of me, de∣maunded


<PB REF="12"/>
of me my name, which presently I told him, then he replied, thou art he that I looke for, for thou hast buried a good Christian, and a Romane Catholike out in the fields, like to a Dog and a Lutheran as thou art thy selfe: therefore I charge thée in the Dukes name to goe along with mée, which command I durst not denie, but went with him, where he brought me be∣fore thrée or foure aged Friers of the Inquisition, &amp; they asked of me whether I were that Lutheran that buried a good Chri∣stian in the fields, for he was a Romane Catholike, and confest, and receiued the Sacrament like to a good Christian, and there∣fore thou shalt be burned, for thou hast done contrary to the Law of <HI>Rome.</HI> I answered that I had buried a good Christian, but not a Romane Catholike, neither was he confest, nor re∣ceiued the Sacrament: they replied, if this be not true which thou hast said thou shalt surely die for it. Therefore take him, and put him into the secret, whither vnto I was brought, which is a prison in this manner: Many double doores being o∣pened, I passed through two or thrée outward prisons then comming to the doore of the secret, whereinto I was thrust, it was so darke that I could sée no part of my body, then féeling round about me with my hands, I found it to be very short in length, &amp; lesse in breadth, but of height I know not how high, because I could neither sée nor féele the top. In this place I was almost ouer shoes in the filth of other men that had died there before, who neuer liued aboue eight or ten daies there at the most: Then wrapping one arme within another, and leaning against the wall, calling to minde <HI>Iobs</HI> miseries and <HI>Daniels</HI> afflictions amidst the Lions, and incouraging my selfe in Gods mercy, sung a Psalme very chéerefully to the praise and glory of God, wherein I was greatly comforted. Then did I draw off my shoes and stockings, &amp; with my bare féete swept all the trash and filth into one corner. In this manner I liued fortie houres before any sléepe possest me, and then being desirous of sléepe, I sate downe and leaned my head against the wall, and slept very soundly, being altogether comforted with a liuely hope in the Almighty God, that he would deliuer me (according to my trust) as he had done before. And when most extreames


<PB REF="12"/>
would oppresse me, then would I be most ioyfull, finding al∣waies an inward motion, saying, be of good comfort, the Lord will deliuer thée: In this manner I liued sixtéene daies, my food being bread &amp; water, and my lodging vpon the cold stones, and being yet aliue, they held it a miracle that I should liue there so long, saying, this Lutherane hath a Lions heart, for we ne∣uer knew any to liue aboue ten daies, wherfore let vs haue him forth to be examined. Then was I brought before the high In∣quisitioner, who demanded of me, whether he that I buried had receiued the Sacrament &amp; confest, according to the Romane or∣der or no, I answered no; he was a good Christian, but receiued not the Sacrament, nor was not confest, after the order of <HI>Rome:</HI> then he said that he was, by a Frier of the <HI>Mesericordia,</HI> &amp; there∣fore thou shalt be burned. Then I intreated that I might but speake, and he said speake on: then I asked them this, whether the Frier that confest him could speak any English or no, he an∣swered that he could speake none: then tell me quoth I, how an Italian Frier (can confesse an Englishman speaking no En∣glish, nor the Englishman speaking no Italian, nor other lan∣guage but his mother tongue? for you know wel there must be no interpreter in confession, &amp; if the Sacrament were ministred vnto him, the house where he died can iustifie it. Then the Inqui∣sitioner hearing this, scratched his head, saying, this fellow hath spoken the truth, wherfore take him and put him out into a large prison, whether I was brought, where I liued ten wéeks being well, and often relieued by English Protestants, who reioyced much to see me aliue. These malicious Friers, there reason wherefore they sought my life was, because they would haue the dead mans pay to themsel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, which if he had béene a Roman Catholik had bin their due, &amp; in respect he was not, they mist of the pay, &amp; of their wicked pretence against me, (God I giue him thanks) by reason I could speak the Italian tongue, for if I had had an interpreter in this, though my cause was iust, yet I had surely died. Ten wéeks being spent in this prison, it was the fortune of one <HI>M. Richard Row</HI> of <HI>Milbrooke,</HI> in the countie of <HI>Cornwel,</HI> to ariue at <HI>Ligorne,</HI> in the good ship called the <HI>Portion</HI> he being owner &amp; Marchant of the said ship, &amp; one day comming


<PB REF="13"/>

In this Citie they speake seuerall Christian lan∣guages, because there are of all Nations in Christendome but principally Italians, and Spanyards. The Neopolitans are very proud, and of a leftie spirit, being for the most part very rich, and costly attired, and most commonly well furnished in∣wardly with their Countrey disease. They are altogether Pa∣pists, and their women very audacious, especially in the sin∣full vse of their bodies, by reason they haue as well their par∣don as priuiledge from <HI>Rome.</HI> In this Citie it is verie dan∣gerous to walke by night, for a man may sodainly be kild for the cloathes on his backe, whither hée be poore or rich.

The great Master liues in <HI>Terra-noua,</HI> which is a great Citie, lying close vpon the Sea, marueilous strongly fortified and planted with Ordnance the like is not in Christendom, for the Turke hath oftentimes sought to take it, with two or thrée hundred sayle of Gallies at a time, but yet was neuer able to take any part of it. To this Iland doth there belong Gallies, though they be but few, to the number of sixe or eight sayle, and also shipping, where∣with they doe much offend the Turke, taking of them very often, and making them slaues: In this Iland they hold the Romish Religion, both men and women, their women are al∣together lasciuious and lewdly giuen, but there men are vali∣ant, Gentlemen, and worthy men at armes: they are of all Nations of Christendome, speaking generally all languages, also they haue an ancient order of Knighthood, sworne by the Crosse of Saint <HI>Iohn,</HI> which is a forked white Crosse which they weare vpon their breasts to be knowne to be C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liers and Knights of <HI>Malta.</HI> The manner of their▪ Oath of Knight∣hood is this: that they shall neuer marry, by reason they shall neuer haue Children legitimate: for there are many Lords

and Noble men sent thither by their Uncles to be Knighted, because they shall neuer marry, whereby after his death his lands shall come to his Uncles issue, yet they are suffered to haue as many whores as they will. Another part of their oath is this. A Knight of <HI>Malta</HI> is sworne not to stand in place where two, thrée, or foure are vpon one in fight, but to take the weaker part, &amp; to fight to the last. They are all of bold courage, being to the number of fiue thousand or there abouts, in <HI>Malta</HI> and other Christian places: another part of their oaths is this, by Land or Sea, whether it be in ship or Gally, they are sworne to incounter their aduersaries, though they be thrée to one, and neuer to yéeld or slip away, for they are sworne to fight it to the last mans death: The which oath they performe very cou∣ragiously, for they are Gentlemen of very great respect, ney∣ther will they euer fall out amongst themselues, being forbid∣den by another part of their oath. As for their maintenance, the poorer sort haue a pention from the great master, which maintains him very gallant, and the richer sort liue vpon their owne charge.

of them doe the labour of sixe Oxen: their hornes are flat, and at mid-day when they vse to rest them, they take them, and turne them into a water, where they will stand for the space of two houres couered quite ouer the backes in water, then will they yoke them and worke them as fresh till night, as they did in the Morning, without any bayting at all. Their Cammels is a meruailous tall beast, hauing a necke twise as long as a Horse, and a great bunch growing about the middle of his backe, as bigge as a pecke, hée is clouen footed, and his tayle little, and for his strength he will carry as much on his backe as foure horses, and continue with his carri∣age on his backe thréescore houres without meat or rest. I haue séene foure thousand of them laden at one time with Merchandise going a very slow pace, and nothing so fast as a Carriers horse, yet will they continue that pace two dayes and two nights together, without any eating or drinking: and when they doe rest and féede, it is but slender and verie little, in this manner: when they come to their resting place they lye downe with their lading vpon their backes. Then the Moores or Turkes, put a Ball made of Date stones bea∣ten, into euery one of their mouthes, the pouder of the stones being compounded with Linséede Oyle, and the white of Egges, which makes the Balls as hard as Stones, and thus they will liue and continue their trauaile sixtéene dayes and nights together, receiuing the said rest and reliefe at e∣uery two dayes end. Their Shéepe are twise as bigge as ours in <HI>England,</HI> but in all fashions like our Shéepe, except the tayle, for their tayles are meruailous great, broad, and thicke, being very fat, for I haue weighed many of their tayles flayed from the Butchers, and they haue waighed ten, eleuen, and twelue pound waight, and throughout all <HI>Barbarie</HI> and <HI>Turkie,</HI> they haue plenty of these beasts, and also all kind of beasts that we haue in <HI>England.</HI> There liue many Gréekes in all parts throughout the Turkes Dominions, but in great bondage and pouertie: they are good Christians, abhorring the Idolatry of <HI>Rome,</HI> and obseruing the same computation for Christmasse and other festiuals, that we doe in <HI>England.</HI></P>

<PB REF="17"/>Also there are Jewes in all parts of Turkie and Barbary, and all parts of Christendome, England excepted: yet though they be thus dispersed throughout most parts of the world, li∣uing in extreame slauery, yet shall you not see one Jew begge his bread. One thing I haue greatly maruelled at, that a Jew is respected more in Christendome, then with the Turks: for the Turks (as you haue heard) detests him aboue any Nation, tying him to a notable and knowne marke, or manner of apparrell, and yeelding him no Law or right, eyther against Turke or Christian: whereas, contrarywise, in Christen∣dome, he is tyed to no manner of weare, but may goe in what shape he lists: and for Law, by reason of his wealth, hee shall sooner haue right done to him then a Christian: wherefore in my minde, the Turke greatly in this condemnes the Po∣pish Christian: for it is an ordinary saying with them, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> if a Jew had put <HI>Mahomet</HI> to death, nay, but touched the hem of his garment violently, they would not haue left one of the race of them aliue, nor yet any thing, or building vnraced, that might procure their memory. But in Christendome they are suffered to build Sinagogues, and to vse their Religion pub∣likely.

<P><HI>CAndy</HI> is a famous Iland of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> very fruitfull,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distant from England <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> leagues</NOTE> yeelding great store of Wine and Oyle, and all other things plentifull. This Iland is very high and long, poynting East and West: the North-side of it very pleasant, with great store of Gardens and Uineyards, and such like: but ve∣ry barren to the Southward-side, with great Rocks, Cliffs, and Mountaynes, which part is inhabited by poore Gréekes: and also there are many small Ilands vnder these Cliffs, inhabited likewise by Gréekes, as <HI>Christiana</HI> and <HI>Godza,</HI> with others more. These Gréekes liue all together in bondage to the Uenetians. The North-side of this Iland is inhabited by Italians, and some Jewes. There are two very fayre Ci∣ties: <HI>(viz.) Candia,</HI> and <HI>Acony,</HI> these Cities are inhabited most with Uenetians, strongly fortified and planted with Ordnance. These Cities lye right against the entring of the Arches of <HI>Appellican,</HI> which goeth to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> where the Great Turke continues, receiuing tribute of the Duke of <HI>Venice</HI> for this Iland, and other parts, for the Uenetian is tributary to the Great Turke. Also the Great Turke kéepes him in subiection by Land and Sea, neither dare the Uenetian ioyne their forces with any Christian, at any time whenso∣euer a Fléete of Gallies and Shipps is set forth against the Turke, yet the Duke of Uenice hath twise as many Gallies as any Christian Prince whatsoeuer, which he doth employ, some of them in Marchandize, hauing continuall trading both with Christian and Turke, and some of his Gallies continually lieth about the entring of the Gulph of <HI>Venice,</HI> about the Iland of <HI>Zant</HI> and <HI>Saphlany,</HI> and the small Iland of the <HI>Stra∣uales,</HI> and néere about <HI>Madona:</HI> these parts doe they defend from any Christian men of warre, or Christian Gallies, or eyther Gallies or Briggantéens of the Turkes that shall ap∣proach néere vnto these parts, in the manner and fashion of


<PB REF="19"/>
men of Warre: and oftentimes the sayd Gallies doe take both Christian and Turke, making Slaues of the men, or else chop∣ping off of their heads; for it is lawfull for him so to doe, by the conclusion betwixt Him, the Christian, and Turke, taking them within twentie leagues compasse of the entrance of his Gulph, but not in any other part of the Sea, without the said compasse.</P>

<P><HI>MOrria</HI> is a small low Iland, lying in the Riuer of <HI>Ama∣zones,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> the highest part of the West Indies. This I∣land is altogether inhabited by Women, hauing no Man∣kinde amongst them: they goe altogether naked, vsing Bow and Arrowes for the killing of their owne foode: the hayre of their heads is long, and their Brests hang low: and whereas many here in England doe imagine that they haue the right Brest seared, or cut off, it is no such matter as now▪ what hath béene in times past I know not: for this of mine owne know∣ledge, I haue seene fortie, fiftie, or threescore of them together, each of them bearing Bow and Arrowes in their hands, going along by the Sea-side; and when they espyed a Fish, they shoote at it, and strike it, and so throwing downe their Bowes, they leap into the water after their Arrowes, and bring the Fish aland, fastned to the Arrow: and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o in all other things as well the dressing of their meate, as their lodging and cu∣stomes, they resemble and imitate the Indians of the Riuer of <HI>Amazons,</HI> as you heard before in that discourse. But some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> these Women doe vse to beare their Children vpon their backs, in this manner: They take a yeere of the unde of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Trée, and with the one end thereof they fasten the Childes hunmes, and about the arme-pits and shoulders with the o∣ther, and so hang him on their backs like a Tinkers Budger, and cast vp the brest to him ouer the shoulder.

One Moneth in the yéere, the Men from each side of the Maine Land comes in their Canowes, ouer to the Iland, euery Man matching himselfe with a Woman, liuing there a Mo∣neth: and what men Children they finde there, they carry a∣way with them; and the Woman Children they leaue behinde with the Mothers. And this is their vse once a yéere, where∣by this Iland is altogether inhabited by Women. There is one thing more to be wondred at, that I haue also séene, that is to say, very good Oysters and Muskles growing vpon trées, for I haue eaten my part of many an hundred of them. And for your better vnderstanding how they grow, you shall know that the Trées stand néere the Sea side, and at euery full tyde the bowes hang into the Sea a fadome, or a fadome and a halfe, so that when the tyde goeth out, they are found hanging in great clusters vpon the branches, like Barnacles to the side of a ship, and at the comming in of the tyde, they receiue their moysture.</P>

<P>The Conclusion of the Booke: to the Reader.</P>
<P>THus farre (gentle Reader) I thought good, out of my slender capacitie, to acquaint thée with a briefe and plaine discourse of my Trauell, which though it be rude, as comming from a barren brayne, which professeth nothing lesse then lear∣ning: yet assure thy selfe it containes vndoubted truth, being no more then I haue séene, knowne, and to my griefe and pe∣rill felt. And if any, as well or better acquainted with these Parts, or any of them, whereof I make mention, disliking the rudenesse of my stile, will vndertake to refine it, hée giues me no discontent, so he derogate not from the truth thereof. And whereas I made promise in the beginning of this Trea∣tise, in these twelue discourses, to touch or speake something of the rest of the places, specified in the Table, I haue partly performed it: but to haue written of them at large, would haue béene but friuolous and superfluous, partly because they are places of no extraordinary note, but specially because they doe in most, or all things, agrée with the Countries to which they are annexed, and tributaries, or vassalls: as the Ilands tributary to the Spaniards, follow their manner of gouern∣ment, customes, and orders. The Turkish tributaries imi∣tate them in most things: and so you may iudge of the rest, according as they are seuerally distinguished. And so much may suffice to cléere that doubt. Now the reasons that vrged me to publish this Booke are manifold, but chiefly three: The first was, to keepe in record, and make knowne my owne mi∣sery, lest with the forgetfull Butler in Pharaos Prison, who being deliuered forgat his promise made to <HI>Ioseph.</HI> that fore∣told his deliuery: so I (such is infirmitie and frailtie of hu∣mane nature) might (cheaked with worldly prosperitie for∣get my mercifull and mightie Deliuerer. The second was, that others (warned by my misery) might shun the like. The last and chiefest reason was, to glorifie God, especially heere in England, which aboue all earthly Countries and Nations is most bound to extend and set forth his glory. For what


<PB REF="21"/>
Christian, reading but the extreame thraldome and punish∣ment he hath inflicted vpon the Jewes, euen to this houre, be∣ing a Nation he had once selected to himselfe from amongst all the Nations of the earth. Or the present misery of the Gréekes, who once were Monarches of the Earth, and one of the chie∣fest Churches of Christendome, being the first fruits of the Gentiles, whose extreame bondage is now lamentable, yet not with the Israelites, sacrificing their children to Idols, but forced to giue as well the tenth of their children, as of their substance to that monstrous <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Idoll the Turke. Or who, duly pondering the blindnesse and obstinacie of the Spaniards, Pope, and Italians, with the horrible and absurd sinnes that God hath giuen them ouer to: Or who, séeing the Infidelitie of the simple <HI>Indian</HI> (well may I call him sim∣ple, because his errour grows more of want of true knowledge then obstinacie) who worships the creature, being ignorant of the Almightie Creator? What English heart (I say) duly pondering these things in generall, or any one of these things in particular, can otherwise choose but falling downe on his bended knées, yéeld God immortall and innumerable thanks and prayse-giuing, not onely for electing him aboue all other Nations of the Earth, to the true and perfect knowledge of his blessed Gospell, but also for preseruing him so long from so many miseries and wretched thral∣domes, whereunto most Nations of the Earth are subiect?</P>
