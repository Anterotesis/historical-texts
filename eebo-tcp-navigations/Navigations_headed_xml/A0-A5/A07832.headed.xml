apt and fit, for man to use, who likewise by that wise∣dome is ordained to be the Lord of all. This globe may be his glasse, to teach him how to use modera∣tion, and discretion, both in his actions and intentions. The wise man sayes, give mee neither riches nor po∣verty; why? Riches might make him proud like Nebuchadnezar, and poverty despaire, like Iobs wife; but a meane betweene both.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vse of vege∣tatives.</HI></NOTE> So it is likewise in the use of Vegetatives, that which hath too much Heate or too much Colde, is said to be venenum, so in the use of sensitives, all those Animals, of what ge∣nus or species soever they be, if they participate of heate or cold, in the superlative, are said to be <HI>Inimi∣ca naturae,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fish poyso∣nous about the Isle of Sall.</HI></NOTE> as in some Fishes about the Isle of Sall, and those Ilandes adjoyninge, betweene the Tropickes, their participatinge of heate and cold, in the superla∣tive is made most manifest, one of which, poysoned a whole Ships company that eate of it. And so it is in Vipers, Toades, and Snakes, that have heate or cold in the superlative degree.</P>
<P>Therefore the Creatures that participate of heate and cold in a meane, are best and holsomest: And so it is in the choyse of love, the middell Zone be∣tweene the two extreames is best, and it is the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efore called <HI>Zona Temperata,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Zona tem∣perata, the Golden meane.</HI></NOTE> and is in the golden meane; and all those Landes lying under that Zone, most requisite and fitt for habitation.

much of heate or cold, are very inconvenient, and are accompanied with many evils. And allthough I am not of opinion with Aristotle, that the landes un∣der <HI>Torrida Zona,</HI> are alltogether uninhabited, I my selfe having beene so neare the equinoctiall line, that I have had the Sunn for my Zenith, and seene proofe to the contrary, yet cannot I deny, but that it is accom∣panied with many inconveniences, as that Fish and Flesh both will taint in those partes, notwithstanding the use of Salt which cannot be wanting there, ordai∣ned by natures hande-worke. And that is a great hinderance to the settinge forth and supply of naviga∣tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Salt aboun∣deth under the Tropicks.</HI></NOTE> the very Sinewes of a florishing Common∣wealth. Then barrennesse, caused through want of raines, for in most of those partes of the world it is seldome accustomed to raine, untill the time of the Tornathees (as the Portingals phrase is, who lived there) and then it will raine about 40. dayes toge∣ther,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Raine</HI> 40. <HI>dayes about August be∣tw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ene Can∣cer and the Line.</HI></NOTE> which moisture serveth to fructify the earth for all the yeare after, duringe which time is seene no raine at all: the heate and cold, and length of day and night, being much alike, with little difference. And these raines are caused by the turning of the windes, which else betweene the Tropickes, doe blow Trade, that is allwayes one way. For next the Tropicke of Cancer it is constantly North-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast, and next the Tro∣picke of Capricorne it is Southwest; so that the windes comming from the Poles, do keepe the aire in those partes coole, and make it temperate and the partes habitable, were it not for those and other inconv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣niences.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="10"/>This <HI>Torrida Zona</HI> is good for Grashoppers: and <HI>Zona Temperata</HI> for the Ant and Bee. But <HI>Frigida Zona</HI> good for neither, as by lamentable experience of Captaine Davis Fate, is manifest, who in his in∣quest of the Nortwest passage for the East India trade was frozen to death.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Capt Davis froze to death.</HI></NOTE> And thefore for <HI>Frigida Zona,</HI> I agree with Aristotle, that it is unfit for habitation: and I know by the Course of the caelestiall globe, that in Groeneland many Degrees short of the Pole Articke,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Groene Land too cold for habitation.</HI></NOTE> the place is too cold, by reason of the Sunns absence almost six monethes, and the land under the continuall power of the frost; which thinge many more Navigators have prooved with pittifull expe∣rience of their wintringe there, as appeareth by the history, I thinke, they will not venture to winter there againe for an India mine.</P>
<P>And as it is found by our Nation under the Pole Articke, so it is likewise to be found under the Antar∣ticke Pole, yet what hazard will not an industrious minde, and couragious spirit undergoe, according to that of the Poēt. <HI>Impiger extremos currit Mercator ad Indos per mare pauperiem fugiens, per saxa, per ignes.</HI> And all to gett and hord up like the Ant and the Bee, and yet as Salomon saith, hee cannot tell whether a foole or a wise man shall enjoy it. Therefore let us leave these two extreames, with their inconveniences, and indeavour to finde out this golden meane, so free from any one of them. Behold the secret wise∣dome of allmighty God, and love unto, our Salomon to raise a man of a lardge hart, full of worthy abilities to be the Index or Loadstarre, that doth point out
<PB N="15" REF="10"/>
unto the English Nation, with ease and comfort how to finde it out. And this the noble minded Gentle∣man, Sir Ferdinando Gorges Knight,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sir Ferdi∣nando Gorges the originall cause of plan∣tinge New England.</HI></NOTE> zealous for the glory of God, the honor of his Majesty, and the bene∣fit of the weale publicke, hath done a great worke for the good of his Country.</P>
<P>And herein this, the wondrous wisedome and love of God, is shewne, by sending to the place his Minister, to sweepe away by heapes the Salvages,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Salvages dyed of the Plague,</HI></NOTE> and also giving him length of dayes, to see the same per∣formed after his enterprise was begunne, for the pro∣pagation of the Church of Christ.</P>
<P>This judicious Gentleman, hath found this goul∣den meane, to be scituated about the middle of those two extreames, and for directions you may proove it thus: Counting the space betweene the Line and ei∣ther of the Poles, in true proportion, you shall finde it to be 90. Degrees: then must we finde the meane, to be neare unto the Center of 90. and that is about 45. Degrees, and then incline unto the Sotherne side of that Center, properly for the benefit of heate, re∣membringe that <HI>Sol &amp; Homo generat hominem;</HI> and then keepe us on that same side, and see what Land is to be found there, and we shall easily discerne that new Eng∣land is on the South side of that Center.</P>
<P>For that Country doth beginne her boundes at 40. Degrees of Northerne latitude, and endes at 45. Degrees of the same latitude,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>New Engl. is placed in the golden meane.</HI></NOTE> and doth participate of heate and cold indifferently, but is oppressed with neither: and therefore may be truly sayd to be within the compasse of that golden meane, most apt and fit
<PB N="16" REF="11"/>
for habitation and generation, being placed by All∣mighty God the great Creator, under that Zone, cal∣led <HI>Zona temperata,</HI> and is therefore most fitt for the generation and habitation of our English nation, of all other, who are more neere neighbours to the Nor∣therne Pole, whose Land lyeth betweene 50. and 54.

<P>But contrary wise in short time after, the hand of God fell heavily upon them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Plague fell on the Indians.</HI></NOTE> with such a mortall stroake, that they died on heapes, as they lay in their houses and the living; that were able to shift for them∣selves would runne away, &amp; let them dy, and let there Carkases ly above the ground without buriall.

<P><PB N="24" REF="15"/>But otherwise it is the custome of those Indian people, to bury their dead ceremoniously, and care∣fully, and then to abandon that place, because they have no desire the place should put them in minde of mortality: and this mortality was not ended, when the Brownists of new Plimmouth were setled at Pa∣tuxet in New England, and by all likelyhood the sick∣nesse that these Indians died of, was the Plague, as by conference with them since my arrivall, and habi∣tation in those partes, I have learned.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is a thing to be admired, and indeede made a pre∣sident, that a Nation yet uncivilizied, should more respect age then some nations civilized; since there are so many precepts both of divine and humane wri∣ters extant:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Age honou∣red among the Indian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI></NOTE> to instruct more Civill Nations in that particular wherein they excell, the younger are all∣wayes obedient unto the elder people, and at their commaunds in every respect without grummbling, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n all councels (as therein they are circumspect to do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir acciones by advise and counsell and not rashly or inconsiderately, the younger mens opinion shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e heard, but the old mens opinion and councell im∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raced and followed, besides as the elder feede and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rovide for the younger in infancy: so doe the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounger after being growne to yeares of manhood, provide for those that be aged, and in distribution of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tes the elder men are first served, by their dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ensator and their counsels (especially if they be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owahs) are esteemed as oracles amongst the younger Natives.</P>

<P>And by meanes of these sleights and such like tri∣vial things, as these they gaine such estimation amongst the rest of the Salvages; that it is thought a very impi∣ous matter for any man to derogate from the words of these Powahs.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the maintaining of their Reputation.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>REputation is such a thing, that it keepes many men in awe, even amongst Civilized nations, and is very much stood upon: it is (as one hath very well noted) the awe of great men and of Kings, and since I have observed it, to be maintained amongst Salvage people, I cannot chuse but give an instance thereof in this treatise, to confirme the common receaved opi∣nion thereof.</P>
<P>The Sachem or Sagamore of Sagus made choise, (when hee came to mans estate) of a Lady of noble dis∣cent, Daughter to Papasiquineo: the Sachem or Saga∣more of the territories neare Merrimack River a man of the best note and estimation in all those parts (and as my Countryman M<SUP>r</SUP>.

The solemnity being ended, Papasiquineo causes a selected number of his men to waite upon his Daughter home: into those parts that did properly be∣long to her Lord, and husband, where the attendants had entertainment by the Sachem of Sagus and his Countrymen: the solemnity being ended, the atten∣dants were gratified.</P>
<P>Not long after the new married Lady had a great

desire to see her father, and her native country, from whence shee came, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Lord willing to pleasure her, &amp; not deny her request (amongst them) thought to be reasonable commanded a selected number of his owne men to conduct his Lady to her Father; wherwith great respect they brought her: and having feasted there a while, returned to their owne country againe, leaving the Lady to continue there at her owne pleasure, a∣mongst her friends, and old acquaintance: where shee passed away the time for a while: and in the end desired to returne to her Lord againe. Her father the old Papa∣siquineo having notice of her intent, sent some of his men on ambassage to the younge Sachem,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An ambas∣sage sent from Papasi∣quin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o to his sonne in law, a Sachem.</HI></NOTE> his sonne in law, to let him understand that his daughter was not willing, to absent her selfe from his company any lon∣ger; &amp; therfore (as the messengers had in charge) desi∣red the younge Lord to send a convoy for her▪ but hee standing upon tearmes of honor, &amp; the maintaining of his reputatiō, returnd to his father in law this answere that when she departed from him, hee caused his men to waite upon her to her fathers territories, as it did become him: but now shee had an intent to returne, it did become her father, to send her back with a convoy of his own people: &amp; that it stood not with his reputa∣tion to make himself or his men so servile, to fetch her againe. The old Sachem Papasiquineo having this mes∣sage returned, was inraged? to think that his young son in law did not esteeme him at a higher rate, then to ca∣pitulate with him about the matter, &amp; returne him this sharpe reply; that his daughters bloud, and birth deser∣ved no more respect; then to be so slighted, &amp; there∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore if he would have her company, hee were best to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end or come for her.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="23"/>The younge Sachem not willing to under value himselfe, and being a man of a stout spirit, did not stick to say, that hee should either send her, by his owne Convey, or keepe her; for hee was not determined to stoope so lowe.</P>

<P>Of their trafficke and trade one vvith another.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ALthough these people have not the use of navi∣gation, whereby they may trafficke as other na¦tions, that are civilized, use to doe, yet doe they bar¦ter for such commodities as they have, &amp; have a kind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of beads;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Beads in stead of Money.</HI></NOTE> in steede of money, to buy withall suc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> things as they want, which they call Wampampeak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and it is of two sorts, the one is white, the other is o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a violet coloure. These are made of the shells o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fishe; the white with them is as silver with us; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other as our gould, and for these beads they buy, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sell, not onely amongst themselves, but even with us</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="23"/>We have used to sell them any of our commo∣dities for this Wampampeak, because we know,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The name of their beads Wampam∣peak.</HI></NOTE> we can have beaver againe of them for it: and these beads are currant in all the parts of New England, from one end of the Coast to the other.</P>
<P>And although some have indevoured by ex∣ample to have the like made, of the same kinde of shels, yet none hath ever, as yet, attained to any per∣fection in the composure of them, but that the Sal∣vages have found a great difference to be in the one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the other; and have knowne the counterfett beads <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom those of their owne making; and have, and doe light them.</P>
<P>The skinnes of beasts are sould and bartered to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch people, as have none of the same kinde in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arts where they live.</P>
<P>Likewise they have earthen potts of divers sizes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom a quarte to a gallon, 2. or 3. to boyle their vit∣eals in; very stronge, though they be thin like our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ron potts.</P>
<P>They have dainty wooden bowles of maple, of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ighe price amongst them, and these are dispersed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y bartering one with the other, and are but in cer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aine parts of the Country made, where the severall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rades are appropriated to the inhabitants of those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arts onely.</P>

<P>THese people are not without providence, though they be uncivilized, but are carefull to preserve foede in store against winter, which is the corne that they laboure and dresse in the summer,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>What care they take, to lay up corne for winter.</HI></NOTE> And although they eate freely of it, whiles it is growinge, yet have they a care to keepe a convenient portion thereof; to releeve them in the dead of winter, (like to the Ant and the Bee) which they put under ground.</P>
<P>Their barnes are holes made in the earth, that will hold a Hogshead of corne a peece in them. In these (when their corne is out of the huske and well dried) they lay their store in greate baskets (which they make of Sparke) with matts under, about the sides and on the top: and putting it into the place made for it, they cover it with earth: and in this manner it is preserved from destruction or putri∣faction; to be used in case of necessity, and not else.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of theire Subtilety.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THese people are not (as some have thought a dull, or slender witted people; but very inge∣nious and very subtile. I could give maine instances to maintaine mine opinion of them in this: But I will onely relate one, which is a passage worthy to be observed.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="25"/>In the Massachussets bay lived Cheecatawback the Sachem or Sagamore of those territories, who had large dominions, which hee did appropriate to himselfe.</P>
<P>Into those parts came a greate company of Sal∣vages, from the territories of Narohiganset, to the number of 100. persons; and in this Sachems Domi∣nions they intended to winter.</P>
<P>When they went a hunting for turkies: they spreade over such a greate scope of ground, that a Turkie could hardily escape them: Deare they killed up in greate abundance, and feasted their bodies very plentifully:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They trade away beavers skinnes for corne.</HI></NOTE> Beavers they killed by no allowance: the skinnes of those they traded away at wassaguscus with my neighboures for corne, and such other commo∣dities as they had neede of; and my neighboures had a wonderfull great benefit by their being in those parts. Yea sometimes (like genious fellowes) they would present their Marchant with a fatt beaver skinne,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A beaver skinne with his tayle on of great esti∣mecion.</HI></NOTE> alwayes the tayle was not diminished, but presented full and whole: although the tayle is a present for a Sachem, and is of such masculaine vertue, that if some of our Ladies knew the benefit thereof, they would desire to have ships sent of purpose, to trade for the tayle alone, it is such a rarity, as is not more esteemed of, then reason doth require.</P>
<P>But the Sachem Cheecatawbak (on whose pos∣sessions they usurped, and converted the commo∣dities thereof to their owne use, contrary to his li∣keing) not being of power to resist them, practised to doe it by a subtile stratagem. And to that end
<PB N="45" REF="25"/>
gave it out amongst us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A subtile plot of a Sachem.</HI></NOTE> that the cause why these other Salvages of the Narohigansets, came into these parts, was to see what strength we were of, and to watch an opportunity to cut us off, and take that which they found in our custody usefull for them; And ad∣ded further, they would burne our howses, and that they had caught one of his men, named Meshebro, and compelled him to discover to them where their barnes, Magazines, or storehowses were, and had taken away his corne, and seemed to be in a pittifull perplexity about the matter.</P>
<P>And the more to adde reputation to this tale, desires that his wifes and children might be harbered in one of our howses. This was graunted, and my neighbours put on corslets, headpeeces, and weapons defensive and offensive.</P>
<P>This thing being knowne to Cheecatawback, hee caused some of his men to bring the Narohigan∣sets to trade, that they might see the preparation.</P>
<P>The Salvage that was a stranger to the plott, sim∣ply comming to trade, and finding his merchants, lookes like lobsters, all cladd in harnesse, was in a maze to thinke what would be the end of it. Haste hee made to trade away his furres, and tooke any thing for them, wishing himselfe well rid of them, and of the company in the howse.</P>
<P>But (as the manner has bin) hee must eate some furmety before hee goe: downe hee sits,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Salvage scared.</HI></NOTE> and eats, and withall had an eie on every side; and now and then saw a sword, or a dagger layd a thwart a headpeece, which hee wondered at, and asked his
<PB N="46" REF="26"/>
giude whether the company were not angry. The guide, (that was privy to his Lords plot) answered in his language. that hee could not tell. But the harme∣lesse Salvage before hee had halfe filled his belly, star∣ted upon a sodayne, and ranne out of the howse in such hast, that hee left his furmety there, and stayed not to looke behinde him who came after: Glad hee was that he had escaped so.</P>
<P>The subtile Sachem hee playd the tragedian; and fained a feare of being surprised; and sent to see whe∣ther the enemies (as the Messenger termed them) were not in the howse; and comes in a by way with his wifes and children; and stopps rhe chinkes of the out howse, for feare the fire might be seene in the night, and be a meanes to direct his enemies where to finde them.</P>
<P>And in the meane time, hee prepared for his Ambassador to his enemies a Salvage, that had lived 12. moneths in England, to the end it might adde reputation to his ambassage.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Salvage that had li∣ved</HI> 12. <HI>Moneths in Eng∣land, sent for an Ambassa∣dor.</HI></NOTE> This man hee sends to those intruding Narohigansets, to tell them that they did very great injury, to his Lord, to trench upon his prerogatives: and advised them to put up their pipes, and begon in time: if they would not, that his Lord would come upon them, and in his ayd his freinds the English, who were up in armes already to take his part, and compell them by force to be gone, if they refused to depart by faire meanes.</P>
<P>This message comming on the neck of that which

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ALthough these Salvages are found to be without Religion, Law, and King (as Sir William Alex∣ander hath well observed,) yet are they not altoge∣ther without the knowledge of God (historically) for they have it amongst them by tradition, that God made one man and one woman, and bad them live to∣gether, and get children, kill deare, beasts, birds, fish, and fowle, and what they would at their pleasure; and that their posterity was full of evill, and made God so angry: that hee let in the Sea upon them, &amp; drowned the greatest part of them, that were naughty men, (the Lord destroyed so.)</P>
<P>And they went to Sanaconquam who feeds upon them, pointing to the Center of the Earth:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The beleefe of the Sal∣vages.</HI></NOTE> where they imagine is the habitation of the Devill:) the other, (which were not destroyed,) increased the world; and when they died (because they were good) went to the howse of Kytan, pointing to the setting of the sonne; where they eate all manner of dainties, and never take paines (as now) to provide it.</P>
<P>Kytan makes provision (they say) and saves them that laboure and there they shall live with him forever<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Sonne called Kytan.</HI></NOTE>

voyd of care. And they are perswaded that Kytan is hee that makes corne growe, trees growe, and all manner of fruits.</P>
<P>And that wee that use the booke of Common prayer, doo it to declare to them, that cannot reade, what Kytan has commaunded us, and that wee doe pray to him with the helpe of that booke; and doe make so much accompt of it, that a Salvage (who had lived in my howse before hee had taken a wife, by whome hee had children) made this request to mee (knowing that I allwayes used him with much more respect then others.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Salvage desired to have his sonn brought up to learne the booke of com∣mon prayer.</HI></NOTE>) That I would let his sonne be brought up in my howse, that hee might be taught to reade in that booke: which request of his I granted; and hee was a very joyfull man to thinke, that his sonne should thereby (as hee said) become an Englishman; and then hee would be a good man.</P>
<P>I asked him who was a good man; his answere was, hee that would not lye, nor steale.</P>
<P>These, with them, are all the capitall crimes, that can be imagined; all other are nothing in respect of those: and hee that is free from these, must live with Kytan for ever, in all manner of pleasure.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THese people, that have by tradition some touch of the immortality of the soule, have likewise a cu∣stome to make some monuments, over the place where the corps is interred: But they put a greate difference betwene persons of noble, and of ignoble, or obscure,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Their custom in burryinge.</HI></NOTE> or inferior discent. For indeed in the grave of the more noble, they put a planck in the bottom for the corps to be layed upon; and on each side a plancke, and a plancke upon the top in forme of a chest, before they cover the place with earth. This done, they erect some thing over the grave in forme of a hearse cloath,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Their man∣ner of Mo∣numents.</HI></NOTE> as was that of Cheekatawbacks mother, which the Plim∣mouth planters defaced, because they accounted it an act of superstition. Which did breede a brawle as hath bin before related: for they hold impious, and inhu∣mane: to deface the monuments of the dead. They themselves esteeme of it as piaculum, and have a cus∣tome amongst them, to keepe their annals: &amp; come at certaine times to lament, &amp; bewaile the losse of their freind; &amp; use to black their faces,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>At burrials, they black their faces.</HI></NOTE> which they so weare in stead of a mourning ornament for a longer or a shorter time, according to the dignity of the person: so is their annals kept and observed with their accu∣stomed solemnity.

<P><PB N="52" REF="29"/>It was a thing very offensive to them, at our first comming into those parts, to aske of them for any one that had bin dead; but of later times it is not so offensively taken, to renew the memory of any de∣seased person, because by our example (which they are apt to followe) it is made more familiare unto them; and they marvell to see no monuments over our dead, and therefore thinke no great Sachem is yet come into those parts: or not as yet deade, because they see the graves all alike.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of their Custome in burning the Country, and the reason thereof.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Salvages are accustomed, to set fire of the Country in all places where they come; and to burne it, twize a yeare, vixe at the Spring, and the fall of the leafe. The reason that mooves them to doe so,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Salva∣ges fire the Country twice a yeare.</HI></NOTE> is because it would other wise be so over∣growne with underweedes, that it would be all a cop∣pice wood, and the people would not be able in any wise to passe through the Country out of a beaten path.</P>
<P>The meanes that they do it with, is with cer∣taine minerall stones, rhat they carry about them: in baggs made for that purpose of the skinnes of little beastes which they convert into good lether; carry∣ing in the same a peece of touch wood (very excellent
<PB N="53" REF="29"/>
for that purpose of their owne making. These mi∣nerall stones they have from the Piquenteenes (which is to the Southward of all the plantations in New Eng∣land) by trade and trafficke with those people.</P>
<P>The burning of the grasse destroyes the under∣woods, and so scorcheth the elder trees, that it shrinkes them, and hinders their grouth very much: So that hee that will looke to finde large trees, and good tymber, must not depend upon the help, of a woodden prospect to finde them on the upland ground; but must seeke for them, (as I and others have done) in the lower grounds where the grounds are wett when the Country is fired: by reason of the snow water that remaines there for a time, untill the Sunne by continuance of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t hath exhaled the vapoures of the earth, and dried up those places, where the fire (by reason of the moisture) can have no power to doe them any hurt: and if he would endevoure to finde out any goodly Cedars, hee must not seeke for them on the higher grounds, but make his inquest for them in the vallies, for the Salvages by this Custome of theirs, have spoiled all the rest: for this custome hath bin continued from the beginninge.</P>
<P>And least their firing of the Country in this man∣ner; should be an occasion of damnifying us, and in∣daingering our habitations; wee our selves have used carefully about the same times; to observe the winds and fire the grounds about our owne habitations, to prevent the Dammage that might happen by any ne∣glect thereof, if t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e fire should come neere those howses in our absence.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="30"/>For when the fire is once kindled, it dilates and spreads it selfe as well against, as with the winde; bur∣ning continually night and day, untill a shewer of raine falls to quench it.</P>
<P>And this custome of firing the Country is the meanes to make it passable, and by that meanes the trees growe here, and there as in our parks: and makes the Country very beautifull, and commodious.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>ALthough Drunkennesse be justly termed a vice, which the Salvages are ignorant of, yet the bene∣fit is very great, that comes to the planters by the sale of strong liquor to the Salvages, who are much taken with the delight of it, for they will pawne their wits, to purchase the acquaintance of it, yet in al the cōmerce that I had with them, I never proffered them any such thing; nay I would hardly let any of them have a drame unles hee were a Sachem, or a Winnaytue, that is a rich man, or a man of estimation, next in degree to a Sa∣chem, or Sagamore: I alwayes tould them it was a∣mongst us the Sachems drinke. But they say if I come to the Northerne parts of the Country, I shall have no trade, if I will not supply thē with lusty liquors, it is the life of the trade, in all those parts, for it so happened, that thus a Salvage desperately killed himselfe, when hee was drunke, a gunne being charged and the cock up, hee sets the mouth to his brest, and putting back the tricker with his foote, shot himselfe dead.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>That the Salvages live a contended life.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>A Gentleman and a traveller, that had bin in the parts of New England for a time, when hee retor∣ned againe in his discourse of the Country, wondered (as hee said,) that the natives of the land lived so poorely, in so rich a Country, like to our Beggers in England: Surely that Gentleman had not time or leasure whiles hee was there, truely to informe himselfe of the state of that Country, and the happy life the Salvages would leade weare they once brought to Christianity.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Salvag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s want the art of navigation</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>I must confesse they want the use and benefit of Navigation (which is the very sinnus of a flourishing Commonwealth,) yet are they supplied with all manner of needefull things, for the maintenance of life and lifelyhood, Foode and rayment are the cheife of all that we make true use of; and of these they finde no want, but have, and may have, them in a most plen∣tifull manner.</P>
<P>If our beggers of England should with so much ease (as they,) furnish themselves with foode, at all seasons, there would not be so many starved in the streets, neither would so many gaoles be stuffed, or gallouses furni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hed with poore wretches, as I have seene them,</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="31"/>But they of this sort of our owne nation, that are fitt to goe to this Canaan are not able to transport themselves, and most of them unwilling to goe from the good ale tap; which is the very loadstone of the lande by which our English beggers steere theire Course: it is the Northpole to which the flowre-de∣luce of their compasse points; the more is the pitty that the Commonalty of oure Land are of such leaden capacities, as to neglect so brave a Country, that doth so plentifully feede Maine lusty and a brave, able men, women, and children that have not the meanes that a Civilized Nation hath to purchase foode and rayment: which that Country with a little industry: will yeeld a man in a very comfortable mea∣sure; without overmuch carking.</P>
<P>I cannot deny but a civilized Nation, hath the preheminence of an uncivilized, by meanes of those instruments that are found to be common amongst civile people, and the uncivile want the use of, to make themselves masters of those ornaments, that make such a glorious shew, that will give a man occa∣sion to cry, <HI>sic transit gloria Mundi.</HI></P>
<P>Now since it is but foode and rayment that men that live needeth (though not all alike,) why should not the Natives of New England be sayd to live richly having no want of either: Cloaths are the badge of sinne, and the more variety of fashions is but the greater abuse of the Creature, the beasts of the forrest there doe serve to furnish them at any time, when they please: fish and flesh they have in greate abundance which they both roast and boyle.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="31"/>They are indeed not served in dishes of plate with variety of Sauces to procure appetite, that needs not there. The rarity of the aire begot by the me∣dicinable quality of the sweete herbes of the Country, alwayes procures good stomakes to the inha∣bitants.</P>
<P>I must needs commend them in this particular, that though they buy many commodities of our Nation, yet they keepe but fewe, and those of speciall use.</P>
<P>They love not to bee cumbered with many uten∣silles, and although every proprietor knowes his owne, yet all things (so long as they will last,) are used in common amongst them: A bisket cake given to one; that one breakes it equally into so many parts, as there be persons in his company, and distributes it. Platoes Commonwealth is so much practised by these people.</P>
<P>According to humane reason guided onely by the light of nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They leade a happy life, being voyd of care.</HI></NOTE> these people leades the more hap∣py and freer life, being voyde of care, which torments the mindes of so many Christians: They are not de∣lighted in baubles, but in usefull things.</P>
<P>Their naturall drinke is of the Cristall fountaine; and this they take up in their hands, by joyning them close together. They take up a great quantity at a time, and drinke at the wrists, It was rhe sight of such a feate, which made Diogenes hurle away his dishe, and like one that would have this principall confirmed. <HI>Natura paucis contentat,</HI> used a dish no more.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="32"/>I have observed that they will not be troubled with superfluous commodities. Such things as they finde, they are taught by necessity to make use of, they will make choise of; and seeke to purchase with industry so that in respect, that their life is so voyd of care, and they are so loving also that they make use of those things they enjoy (the wife onely excepted as common goods,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They make use of ordi∣nary things, one of an∣others as common.</HI></NOTE> and are therein, so compassionate that rather than one should starve through want, they would starve all, thus doe they passe away the time merrily, not regarding our pompe (whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they see dayly before their faces) but are better con¦tent with their owne, which some men esteeme s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> meanely of.</P>
<P>They may be rather accompted to live richly wanting nothing that is needefull; and to be commen¦ded for leading a contented life, the younger bein<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ruled by the Elder, and the Elder ruled by the Powahs and the Powahs are ruled by the Devill, and then yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may imagin what good rule is like to be amongst them.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A famous Country.</HI></NOTE>And when I had more seriously considered, of the bewty of the place, with all her faire indowments, I did not thinke that in all the knowne world it could be paralel'd.

to the end, that they may the better perceive their error, who cannot imagine, that there is any Country in the universall world, which may be compared unto our native soyle, I will now discover unto them a Country whose indowments are by learned men al∣lowed to stand in a paralell with the Israelites Canaan, which none will deny, to be a land farre more excel∣lent then Old England in her proper nature.</P>
<P>This I consider I am bound in duety (as becommeth a Christian man) to performe, for the glory of God, in the first place; next (according to Cicero,) to acknow∣ledge that, <HI>Non nobis solum nati sumus, sed partim pa∣tria, partim parentes, partim amici vindicant.</HI></P>
<P>For which cause I must approove of the indea∣voures of my Country men, that have bin studious to inlarge the territories of his Majesties empire by plan∣ting Coloines in America.</P>

<P>NOw that I have breifly shewed the Commodity of the trees, herbes, and fruits. I will shew you a description of the fowles of the aire, as most proper in ordinary course.</P>
<P>And first of the Swanne,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Swannes.</HI></NOTE> because shee is the big∣gest of all the fowles of that Country. There are of them in Merrimack River, and in other parts of the country, greate store at the seasons of the yeare.</P>
<P>The flesh is not much desired of the inhabitants, but the skinnes may be accompted a commodity, fitt for divers uses, both for fethers, and quiles.</P>
<P>There are Geese of three sorts vize brant Geese, which are pide, and white Geese which are bigger,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Geese <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ide, white, and gray.</HI></NOTE> and gray Geese which are as bigg and bigger then the tame Geese of England, with black legges, black bills, heads, and necks black; the flesh farre more excellent, then the Geese of England, wilde or tame, yet the pu∣rity of the aire is such, that the biggest is accompted but an indifferent meale for a couple of men. There is of them great abundance. I have had often 1000. before the mouth of my gunne, I never saw any in

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ducks pide, gray, &amp; black</HI></NOTE>Ducks, there are of three kindes, pide Ducks, gray Ducks, and black Ducks in greate abundance: the most about my habitation were black Ducks: and it was a noted Custome at my howse, to have every mans Duck upon a trencher, and then you will thinke a man was not hardly used, they are bigger boddied, then the tame Ducks of England: very fatt and dain∣ty flesh.</P>
<P>The common doggs fees were the gibletts, un∣lesse they were boyled now and than for to make broath.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Teales greene and blew.</HI></NOTE>Teales, there are of two sorts greene winged, and blew winged: but a dainty bird, I have bin much delighted with a rost of these for a second course, I had plenty in the rivers and ponds about my howse.</P>

<P>Simpes, there are like our Simpes in all respects, with very litle difference.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Simpes.</HI></NOTE> I have shot at them onely, to see what difference I could finde betweene them and and those of my native Country, and more I did no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> regard them.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="37"/>Sanderlings are a dainty bird, more full bod∣died than a Snipe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sanderlings.</HI></NOTE> and I was much delighted to feede on them, because they were fatt, and easie to come by, because I went but a stepp or to for them: and I have killed betweene foure and five dozen at a shoot which would loade me home.</P>
<P>Their foode is at ebbing water on the sands, of small seeds, that grows on weeds there, and are very good pastime in August.</P>
<P>Cranes, there are greate store,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cranes.</HI></NOTE> that ever more came there at S. Davids day, and not before: that day they never would misse.</P>
<P>These sometimes eate our corne, and doe pay for their presumption well enough; and serveth there in powther, with turnips to supply the place of pow∣thered beefe, and is a goodly bird in a dishe, and no discommodity.</P>
<P>Turkies there are,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Turkies.</HI></NOTE> which divers times in great flocks have sallied by our doores; and then a gunne (being commonly in a redinesse,) salutes them with such a courtesie, as makes them take a turne in the Cooke roome. They daunce by the doore so well.</P>
<P>Of these there hath bin killed, that have weighed forty eight pound a peece.</P>
<P>They are by mainy degrees sweeter then the tame Turkies of England, feede them how you can.</P>
<P>I had a Salvage who hath taken out his boy in a morning, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y have brought home their loades about noone.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="38"/>I have asked them what number they found in the woods, who have answered Neent Metawna, which is a thosand that day; the plenty of them is such in those parts. They are easily killed at rooste, because the one being killed, the other sit fast never∣thelesse, and this is no bad commodity.</P>
<P>There are a kinde of fowles which are common∣ly called Pheisants,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pheisants.</HI></NOTE> but whether they be pheysants or no, I will not take upon mee, to determine. They are in forme like our pheisant henne of England. Both the male and the female are alike; but they are rough footed; and have stareing fethers about the head and neck, the body is as bigg as the pheysant henne of Eng∣land; and are excellent white flesh, and delicate white meate, yet we seldome bestowe a shoot at them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Partridges bigger in bo∣dy as those of England.</HI></NOTE>Partridges, there are much, like our Partridges of England, they are of the same plumes, but bigger in body. They have not the signe of the horseshoe on the brest as the Partridges of England; nor are they coloured about the heads as those are; they sit on the trees. For I have seene 40. in one tree at a time: yet at night they fall on the ground, and sit untill mor∣ning so together; and are dainty flesh.</P>
<P>There are quailes also, but bigger then the quailes in England.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quailes big∣ger in body as those in England.</HI></NOTE> They take trees also: for I have numbered 60. upon a tree at a time.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Larkes sing not.</HI></NOTE>The Larkes there, are like our Larkes of Eng∣land in all respects: sauing that they doe not use to sing at all.</P>

<P>There are Hawkes in New England of 5. sorts,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hawkes of fiue sorts.</HI></NOTE> and these of all other fether fowles I must not omitt, to speake of, nor neede I to make any Apology for my selfe, concerning any trespasse, that I am like to make upon my judgement, concerning the nature of them, having bin bred in so genious a way, that I had the common use of them in England: and at my first arrivall in those parts practised to take a Lannaret, which I reclaimed, trained,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Lannaret.</HI></NOTE> and made flying in a fortnight, the same being a passinger at Michuel∣mas. I found that these are most excellent Mettell, rank winged, well conditioned, and not tickleish footed, and having whoods, bels, luers, and all things fitting, was desirous to make experiment of that kinde of Hawke, before any other.</P>
<P>And I am perswaded: that Nature hath ordained them to be of a farre better kinde, then any that have bin used in England. They have neither dorre, nor worme to feed upon (as in other parts of the world) the Country affording none, the use whereof in other parts, makes the Lannars there more bussardly, then they be in New England.</P>
<P>There are likewise Fawcons, and tassell gentles,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fawcons.</HI></NOTE> admirable well shaped birds, and they will tower up

when they purpose to pray, and on a sodaine, when they esspie their game, they will make such a cancel∣lere, that one would admire to behold them, Some there are more black, then any that have bin used in England.</P>
<P>The Tassell gent, (but of the least size) is an ornament for a person of estimation among the In∣dians to weare in the knot of his lock, with the traine upright, the body dried and stretched out. They take a great pride in the wearing of such an ornament, and give to one of us (that shall kill them one for that purpose) so much beaver as is worth three pounds sterling very willingly.</P>
<P>These doe us but little trespas, because they pray on such birds as are by the Sea side, and not on our Chickens. Goshawkes there are, and Tassels.</P>
<P>The Tassels are short trussed bussards; but the Goshawkes are well shaped,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Goshawkes well shaped</HI></NOTE> but they are small; some of white male, and some redd male, I have seene one with 8. barres in the traine. These fall on our big∣ger poultry: the lesser chicken. I thinke they scorne to make their pray of; for commonly the Cocke goes to wrack. Of these I have seene many, and if they come to trespasse me, I lay the law to them with the gunne, and take them dammage fesant.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Marlins small and greate.</HI></NOTE>There are very many Marlins; some very small, and some so large as is the Barbary Tassell.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Beasts, of the forrest.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NOw that I have made a rehearsall of the birds, and fethered Fowles, which participate most of aire, I will give you a description of the beasts, and shew you, what beasts are bred in those parts, and what my experience hath gathered, by observation of
<PB N="74" REF="40"/>
their kinde, and nature, I begin with the most usefull and most beneficiall beast, which is bredd in those parts, which is the Deare.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Deare of</HI> 3. <HI>kindes.</HI></NOTE>There are in this Country, three kindes of Deare▪ of which there are greate plenty, and those are very usefull.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mose or Red deare.</HI></NOTE>First, therefore I will speake of the Elke, which the Salvages call a Mose: it is a very large Deare, with a very faire head, and a broade palme, like the palme of a fallow Deares horne, but much bigger, and is 6. footewide betweene the tipps, which grow curbing downwards: Hee is of the bignesse of a great horse.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mose or deare greater then a horse, the height of them</HI> 18. <HI>handfulles.</HI></NOTE>There have bin of them, seene that has bin 18. handfulls highe: hee hath a bunch of haire under his jawes: hee is not swifte, but stronge and large in body, and longe legged; in somuch that hee doth use to kneele, when hee feedeth on grasse.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They bringe forth thr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e faunes at one time.</HI></NOTE>Hee bringeth forth three faunes, or younge ones, at a time; and being made tame, would be good for draught, and more usefull (by reason of their strength) then the Elke of Raushea. These are found very frequent, in the northerne parts of New England, their fle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h is very good foode, and much better then our redd Deare of England.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They make go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther of the hides of Deare.</HI></NOTE>Their hids are by the Salyages converted into very good lether, and dressed as white as milke.</P>
<P>Of this lether, the Salvages make the best shooes, and use to barter away the skinnes to other Salvages, that have none of that kinde of bests in the parts where they live. Very good buffe may be made of the
<PB N="75" REF="40"/>
hids, I have seene a hide as large as any horse hide that can be found. There is such abundance of them that the Salvages, at hunting time, have killed of them so many, that they have bestowed six or seaven at a time, upon one English man whome they have borne affection to.</P>
<P>There is a second sort of Deare (lesse then the redd Deare of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The midling Deare or fal∣low Deare.</HI></NOTE> but much bigger then the English fallow Deare) swift of foote, but of a more darke coloure; with some griseld heares. When his coate is full growne in the summer season, his hornes grow curving, with a croked beame, resembling our redd Deare, not with a palme like the fallow Deare.</P>
<P>These bringe 3. fawnes at a time, spotted like our fallow Deares fawnes; the Salvages say, foure, I speake of what I know to be true; for I have killed, in February a doe with three fawnes in her belly, all heared, and ready to fall; for these Deare fall their fawnes, 2. moneths sooner; then the fallow Deare of England. There is such abundance of them, that an hundred have bin found at the spring of the yeare, within the compasse of a mile.</P>
<P>The Salvages take these in trappes made of their naturall Hempe, which they place in the earth;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Trappes to catch the Deare.</HI></NOTE> where they fell a tree for browse, and when hee rounds the tree for the browse, if hee tread on the trapp, hee is horsed up by the legg, by meanes of a pole that starts up, and catcheth him.</P>
<P>Their hides the Saluages use for cloathing, and will give for one hide killed in season 2.3. or 4. beaver skinnes, which will yeild pounds a peece in that Coun∣try:
<PB N="76" REF="41"/>
so much is the Deares hide prised with them above the beaver. I have made good merchandize of these, the flesh is farre sweeter then the venison of England: and hee feedeth fatt and leane together as a swine, or mutton, where as our Deare of England feede fatt on the out side, they doe not croake at rutting time, nor spendle shafte, nor is their flesh discolored at rutting. Hee that will impale ground fitting, may be brought once in the yeare, wherewith bats and men hee may take so many to put into that parke, as the hides will pay the chardge of impalcinge, If all these things be well considered, the Deare, as well as the Mose, may have a principall place in the catalogue of commodities.</P>
<P>I for my part may be bould to tell you, that my howse,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Humb∣les was the doggs fee.</HI></NOTE> was not without the flesh of this sort of Deare, winter nor summer, the humbles was ever my dogges fee, which by the wesell, was hanged on the barre in in the Chimny, for his diet only: for hee has brought to my stand a brace in a morning, one after the other, before sunne rising, which I have killed.</P>
<P>There is likewise, a third sorte of deare, lesse then the other,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Roe bucks or Rayne Deare.</HI></NOTE> (which are a kinde of rayne deare) to the south∣ward of all the English plantations, they are excellen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> good flesh. And these also bring three fawnes at a time, and in this particular the Deare of thos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> parts, excell all the knowne Deare of the whol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> world.</P>
<P>On all these the Wolfes doe pray continually the best meanes they have (to escape the wolfes is b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> swimming to Islands,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Wolfes pray upon Deare.</HI></NOTE> or necks of land, whereb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="77" REF="41"/>
they escape: for the wolfe will not presume to follow them, untill they see them over a river; then being landed, (they wayting on the shore) undertake the wa∣ter, and so follow with fresh suite.</P>
<P>The next in mine opinion fit to be spoaken of,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Beaver.</HI></NOTE> is the Beaver; which is a Beast ordained, for land and water both, and hath fore feete like a cunny, her hinder feete like a goese, mouthed like a cunny, but short ea∣red like a Serat, fishe in summer, and wood in winter, which hee conveyes to his howse built on the water, wherein hee sitts with his tayle hanging in the water, which else would over heate and rot off.</P>
<P>Hee cuts the bodies of trees downe with his fore∣teeth, which are so long as a boares tuskes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Beavers cut downe trees, with hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fore teeth.</HI></NOTE> &amp; with the help of other beavers (which held by each others tayles like a teeme of horses) the hind most with the legg on his shoulder stayed by one of his fore feete against his head) they draw the logg to the habitation appoynted, placing the loggs in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quare, and so by pyling one uppon another, they build up a howse, which with boghes is covered very strongly, and placed in some pond to which they make a damme of brush wood like a hedge: so stronge, that I have gone on the top of it crosse the current of that pond. The flesh of this beast is excellent foode. The fleece is a very choise furre, which (before the Salvages had commerce with Christians) they burned of the tayle, this beast is of a masculine vertue for the advancement of Priapus: and is preserved for a dish for the Sachems, or Sagamores: who are the princ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the people but not Kings (as is fondly supposed.)</P>

Angels of gold. The Flesh is eaten by the Salvages: but how good it is I cannot shew, because it is not eaten by our Nation. Yet is this a beast, that ought to be placed in the number amongst the Commodities of the Country.</P>
<P>The Luseran, or Luseret, is a beast like a Catt: but so bigg as a great hound:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Luseran as bigg as a hound.</HI></NOTE> with a tayle shorter then a Catt. His clawes are like a Catts, Hee will make a pray of the Deare. His Flesh is dainty meat, like a lambe: his hide is a choise furre, and accompted a good commodity.</P>
<P>The Martin is a beast about the bignes, of a Foxe. His furre is chestnutt coloure,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Martin is about the bignesse of a Fox.</HI></NOTE> and of those there are greate store in the Northerne parts of the Country, and is a good commodity.</P>
<P>The Racowne is a beast as bigg, full out, as a Foxe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Racowne.</HI></NOTE> with a Bushtayle. His Flesh excellent foode: his oyle precious for the Syattica, his furre course, but the skinnes serve the Salvages for coats: and is with those people of more esteeme, then a coate of beaver,
<PB N="79" REF="42"/>
because of the tayles that (hanging round in their or∣der) doe adorne the garment, and is therefore so much esteemed of them. His fore feete are like the feete of an ape; and by the print thereof, in the time of snow, he is followed to his hole, which is common∣ly in a hollow tree, from whence hee is fiered out, and saotken.</P>
<P>The Foxes are of two coloures: the one redd,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Foxes red and gray.</HI></NOTE> the other gray, these feede on fish; and are good furre, they doe not stinke, as the Foxes of England, but their condition for their pray, is as the Foxes of Eng∣land.</P>
<P>The Wolfes are of divers coloures:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Wolfes of diverse coloures.</HI></NOTE> some sandy coloured: some griselled, and some black, their foode is fish which they catch, when they passe up the rivers, into the ponds to spawne, at the spring time. The Deare are also their pray, and at summer, when they have whelpes, the bitch will fetch a puppy dogg from our dores, to feede their whelpes with. They are fearefull Curres, and will runne away from a man (that meeteth them by chaunce at a banke end) as fast as any fearefull dogge. These pray upon the Deare very much. The skinnes are used by the Salvages, especially the skinne of the black wolfe, which is esteemed a present for a prince there.</P>
<P>When there ariseth any difference betweene prince, and prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The skin of a black wolfe, a present for a prince.</HI></NOTE> the prince that desires to be re∣conciled to his neighbouring prince does endeavour to purchase it, by sending him a black wolfes skinne for a present, and the acceptance of such a present is an assurance of reconciliation betweene them; and the
<PB N="80" REF="43"/>
Salvages will willingly give 40. beaver skinnes for the purchase of one of these black Wolfes skinnes: and all∣though the beast himselfe be a discommodity, which other Countries of Christendome are subject unto, yet is the skinne of the black wolfe worthy, the title of a commodity, in that respect that hath bin de∣clared.</P>
<P>If I should not speake something of the beare, I might happily leave a scruple,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Beares afraid of a man.</HI></NOTE> in the mindes of some effeminate persone who conceaved of more dainger in them, then there is cause. Therefore to incou∣rage them against all Feare, and Fortifie their mindes against needles danger, I will relate what experience hath taught mee; concerning them, they are beasts that doe no harme in those parts: they feede upon Hurtle buries, Nuts, and Fish, especially shellfish.</P>
<P>The Beare is a tyrant at a Lobster, and at low water will downe to the Rocks, and groape after them with great diligence.</P>
<P>Hee will runne away from a man as fast as a litle dogge,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Salvages seeing a beare chase him like a dogg and kill him.</HI></NOTE> If a couple of Salvages chaunce to espie him at his banquet, his running a way, will not serve his turne, for they will coate him, and chase him betweene them home to theire howses, where they kill him, to save a laboure in carrying him farre. His Flesh is esteemed venison, and of a better taste then beefe.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Fishes, and vvhat Commodity they proove.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AMong Fishes. First I will begin with the Codd; because it is the most commodious of all fish, as may appeare, by the use which is made of them in for∣raigne parts.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Codd.</HI></NOTE>The Codd fishing is much used in America, (whereof New England is a part) in so much as 300. Sayle of shipps, from divers parts, have used to be im∣ployed yearely in that trade.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">15. <HI>Shipps at one time for Codd.</HI></NOTE>I have seene in one Harboure, next Richmond Iland 15. Sayle of shipps at one time, that have taken in them, driyed Codds for Spaine, and the Straights (and it has bin found that the Saylers have made 15.18.20.22. p. share for a common man.</P>
<P>The Coast aboundeth with such multitudes of Codd, that the inhabitants of New England doe dunge their grounds with Codd; and it is a commo∣dity better than the golden mines of the Spanish In∣dies; for without dried Codd the Spaniard, Portingal, and Italian, would not be able to vittel of a shipp for the Sea; and I am sure at the Canaries it is the princi∣pall commodity: which place lyeth neere New Eng∣land
<PB N="87" REF="46"/>
yery convenient, for the vending of this com∣modity, one hundred of these being at the price of 300. of New found land Codds, greate store of traine oyle, is mayd of the livers of the Codd,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oyle mayd of the livers of the Codd.</HI></NOTE> and is a commodity that without question will enrich the in∣habitants of New England quicly; and is therefore a principall commodity.</P>
<P>The Basse is an excellent Fish, both fresh and Salte one hundred whereof salted (at a market) have yeilded 5. p. They are so large,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A</HI> 100. <HI>Basse sould for</HI> 5. <HI>p.</HI></NOTE> the head of one will give a good eater a dinner, and for daintinesse of diet, they excell the Marybones of Beefe. There are such multitudes, that I have seene stopped into the river close adjoyning to my howse with a sand at one tide, so many as will loade a ship of a 100. Tonnes.</P>
<P>Other places have greater quantities in so much, as wagers have bin layed, that one should not throw a stone in the water, but that hee should hit a fish.</P>
<P>I my selfe, at the turning of the tyde, have seene such multitudes passe out of a pound, that it seemed to mee, that one might goe over their backs drishod.</P>
<P>These follow the bayte up the rivers, and some∣times are follwed for bayte and chased into the bayes, and shallow waters, by the grand pise: and these may have also a prime place in the Catalogue of Commo∣dities.</P>
<P>The Mackarels are the baite for the Basse, and these have bin chased into the shallow waters,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mackarell are baite for Basse.</HI></NOTE> where so many thousands have shott themselves a shore with the surfe of the Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that whole hogges-heads have bin taken up on the Sands; and for length they excell
<PB N="88" REF="47"/>
any of other parts: they have bin measured 18. and 19. inches in length, and seaven in breadth: and are taken with a drayle, (as boats use to passe to and froe at Sea on businesse) in yery greate quantities all alonge the Coaste.</P>
<P>The Fish is good, salted; for store against the winter, as well as fresh, and to be accounted a good Commodity.</P>
<P>This Sturgeon in England is <HI>regalis piscis.</HI> every man in New England may catch what hee will, there are multitudes of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sturgeon.</HI></NOTE> and they are much fatter then those that are brought into England from other parts, in so much as by reason of their fatnesse, they doe not looke white, but yellow, which made a Cooke presume they were not so good as them of Roushea: silly fellow that could not understand that it is the na∣ture of fish salted, or pickelled, the fatter the yel∣lower being best to preserve.</P>
<P>For the taste I have warrant of Ladies of worth, with choise pallats for the commendations, who liked the taste so well, that they esteemed it beyond the Sturgeon of other parts, and sayd they were decea∣ved in the lookes: therefore let the Sturgeon passe for a Commodity.</P>
<P>Of Salmons there is greate abundance: and these may be allowed for a Commodity,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Salmon.</HI></NOTE> and placed in the Catallogue.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Herrings.</HI></NOTE>Of Herrings, there is greate store, fat, and faire: and (to my minde) as good as any I have seene, and these may be preserved, and made a good commodity at the Canaries.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="47"/>Of Eeles there is abundance, both in the Salt∣waters, and in the fresh: and the fresh water Eele there (if I may take the judgement of a London Fish∣monger) is the best that hee hath found in his life time. I have with jieele potts found my howse hold,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Great plenty of Eeles.</HI></NOTE> (being nine persons, besides doggs) with them, taking them every tide, (for 4. moneths space,) and preserving of them for winter store: and these may proove a good commodity.</P>
<P>Of Smelts there is such abundance,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Smelts.</HI></NOTE> that the Sal∣vages doe take them up in the rivers with baskets, like sives.</P>
<P>There is a Fish, (by some called shadds,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Shadds or Allizes taken to dunge ground.</HI></NOTE> by some al∣lizes) that at the spring of the yeare, passe up the rivers to spaune in the ponds; and are taken in such multi∣tudes in every river, that hath a pond at the end, that the Inhabitants doung their ground with them. You may see in one towneship a hundred acres together, set with these Fish, every acre taking 1000. of them: and an acre thus dressed will produce and yeald so much corne, as 3. acres without fish: and (least any Virginea man would inferre hereupon, that the ground of New England is barren, because they use no fish in setting their corne, I desire them to be remembred, the cause is plaine in Virginea) they have it not to sett. But this practise is onely for the Indian Maize (which must be set by hands) not for English graine: and this is therefore a commodity there.</P>
<P>There is a large sized fish called Hallibut,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Turbut or Hallibut.</HI></NOTE> or Tur∣but: some are taken so bigg that two men have much a doe to hale them into the boate; but there is
<PB N="90" REF="48"/>
such plenty, that the fisher men onely eate the heads, and finnes, and throw away the bodies: such in Paris would yeeld 5. or 6. crownes a peece: and this is no discommodity.</P>
<P>There are excellent Plaice and easily taken. They (at flowing water) do almost come a shore,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plaice.</HI></NOTE> so that one may stepp but halfe a foote deepe, and prick them up on the sands: and this may passe with some allowance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hake.</HI></NOTE>Hake is a dainty white fish, and excellent vittell fresh; and may passe with other commodities, because there are multitudes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pilchers.</HI></NOTE>There are greate store of Pilchers: at Michelmas, in many places, I have seene the Cormorants in length 3. miles feedinge upon the Sent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lobsters.</HI></NOTE>Lobsters are there infinite in store in all the parts of the land, and very excellent.

<P>This being knowne, they shall passe for a com∣modity to the inhabitants; for the Salvages will meete 500, or 1000. at a place where Lobsters come in with the tyde, to eate, and save dried for store, abiding in that place, feasting and sporting a moneth or 6. weekes together.</P>
<P>There are greate store of Oysters in the entrance of all Rivers:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oysters.</HI></NOTE> they are not round as those of Eng∣land, but excellent fat, and all good. I have seene an Oyster banke a mile at length.</P>

<P>Here may very many brave Townes and Citties be erected which may have intercourse one with an∣other by water, very commodiously: and it is of many men of good judgement, accounted the prime seate for the Metropolis of New Canaan, From this Lake Northwards is derived the famous River of Canada, (so named of Monsier de Cane a French Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Canada, so named of Monsier de Cane.</HI></NOTE> that first planted a Colony of French in America, there called Nova Francia, from whence Captaine Kerke of late, by taking that plantation, brought home in one shipp (as a Seaman of his Company, reported in my hearing) 25000.

<P>And from this Lake Southwards, trends that good∣ly River called of the Natives Patomack, which dis∣chardgeth herselfe in the parts of Virginea,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Patomack.</HI></NOTE> from whence it is navigable by shipping of great Burthen up to the Falls (which lieth in 41.

<P>It is tenne yeares since first the relation of these things came to the eares of the English: at which time wee were but slender proficients in the language of the Natives, and they, (which now have attained to more perfection of English, could not then make us rightly apprehend their meaninge.</P>

<P>About the parts of this Lake may be made a very greate Commodity by the trade of furres, to inrich those that shall plant there; a more compleat disco∣very of those parts: is (to my knowleadge) under∣taken by Henry Ioseline Esquier sonne of Sir Thomas Ioseline of Kent Knight, by the approbation and ap∣pointement of that Heroick and very good Com∣mon wealths man Captaine Iohn Mason Esquier, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

If that River be derived from the Lake as our Country man in his prospect affirmes it to be, and if they get and fortifie this place also, they will gleane away the best of the Beaver both from the French and English, who have hitherto lived wholely by it, and very many old planters have gained good estates out of small beginnings by meanes thereof.</P>
<P>And it is well knowne to some of our Nation that have lived in the Dutch plantation:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Dutch have a great trade of Bea∣ver in Hud∣sons River.</HI></NOTE> that the Dutch have gained by Beaver 20000. pound a yeare.</P>
<P>The Salvages make report of 3. great Rivers that issue out of this Lake 2. of which are to us knowne, the one to be Patomack, the other Canada, and why may not the third be found there likewise, which they describe to trend westward, which is conceaved to dis∣charge herselfe into the South Sea. The Salvages affirme that they have seene shipps in this Lake with 4. Masts which have taken from thence for their la∣dinge earth, that is conjectured to be some minerall stuffe.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="53"/>There is probability enough for this, and it may well be thought, that so great a confluxe of waters as are there gathered together, must be vented by some great Rivers: and that if the third River (which they have made mention of) proove to be true as the other two have done:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The passage to the East-Indies.</HI></NOTE> there is no doubt but that the passage to the East India, may be obtained, without any such daingerous and fruitlesse inquest by the Norwest, as hetherto hath bin endeavoured: And there is no Traveller of any resonable capacity, but will graunt, that about this Lake, must be innumerable springes, and by that meanes many fruitfull, and pleasant pastures all about it, It hath bin observed that the in∣land part (witnes Neepnet) are more pleasant and fer∣tile then the borders of the Sea coaste.

<PB N="127" REF="66"/>
be suspected, hee leaves his shooes in the howse, with all his other implements, and flies, as hee was on his way, to increase his feare, suggestinge himselfe that hee was present by a company of Indians, &amp; that there shafts were let fly as thick as haile at him, hee puts of his breeches, and puts them one his head, for to save him from the shafts, that flew after him so thick, that no man could perceave them: and cryinge out a∣voyd Satan, what have yee to doe with mee, thus run∣ning one his way without his breeches, hee was pit∣tifully scratched, with the brush of the underwoods, as hee wandred up and downe in unknowne wayes: The Salvages in the meane time put up all his im∣plements in the sack hee left behinde, and brought them to Wessaguscus, where they thought to have found him; but understanding hee was not returned, were ferefull what to doe: and what would be con∣ceaved of the English was become of this mazed man, the Master of the Ceremonies; and were in consulta∣tion of the matter.

So they boldly adventured, to shew what they had brougt, and how the matter stood. The English (when the sack was opened) did take a note in writing of all the particulers that were in the sack;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>They take a note of, what was in the sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k.</HI></NOTE> &amp; heard what was b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Salvages related of the acci∣dents:
<PB N="128" REF="67"/>
but when his shoes were showne, it was thought hee would not have departed without his shoes; and therefore they did conceave that Master Bubble was made away: by some sinister practise of the Salvages, who unadvisedly had bin culpable of a crime which now they sought to excuse; and straightly chardged the Salvages to finde him out againe, and bring him dead, or alive; else their wifes and children should be destroyed.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mr. Bubble must be found againe or else they shall be de∣stroyed,</HI></NOTE> The poore Salvages being in a pittifull perplexity, caused their Countrymen to seeke out for this maz'd man; who being in short time found, was brought to Wessaguscus; where hee made a discourse of his travels, and of the perrillous passages: which did seeme to be no lesse dangerous, then these of that worthy Knight Errant, Don Quixote, and how mira∣culously hee had bin preserved; and in conclusion, la∣mented the greate losse of his goods, whereby hee thought himselfe undone.</P>
<P>The perticuler whereof being demaunded, it ap∣peared,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Not any thing dimi∣nished.</HI></NOTE> that the Salvages had not diminished any part of them; no not so much as one bit of bread: the num∣ber being knowne, and the fragments laid together, it appeared all the bisket was preserved, and not any di∣minished at all: whereby the Master of the Ceremonies was overjoyed, and the whole Company made them∣selves merry at his discourse of all his perrillous ad∣ventures</P>
<P>And by this you may observe whether the Salvage people are not full of humanity, or whether they are a dangerous people as Master Bubble and the rest of his tribe would perswade you.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Revells of Nevv Canaan.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Inhabitants of Pasonagessit (having translated the name of their habitation from that ancient Sal∣vage name to Ma-re Mount; and being resolved to have the new name confirmed for a memorial to after ages) did devise amongst themselves to have it performed in a solemne manner with Revels, &amp; merriment after the old English custome:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Maypole.</HI></NOTE> prepared to sett up a Maypole upon the festivall day of Philip and Iacob; &amp; therefore brewed a barrell of excellent beare, &amp; provided a case of bottles to be spent, with other good cheare, for all commers of that day. And because they would have it in a compleat forme, they had prepared a song fit∣ting to the time and present occasion. And upon May∣day they brought the Maypole to the place appointed, with drumes, gunnes, pistols, and other fitting instru∣ments, for that purpose; and there erected it with the help of Salvages, that came thether of purpose to see the manner of our Revels. A goodly pine tree of 80. foote longe, was reared up, with a peare of buckshorns nayled one, somewhat neare unto the top of it: where it stood as a faire sea marke for directions; how to finde out the way to mine Hoste of Ma-re Mount.</P>
<P>And because it should more fully appeare to what end it was placed there, they had a poem in readines made, which was fixed to the Maypole, to shew the new name confirmed upon that plantation; which all∣though it were made according to the occurrents

<P>This harmeles mirth made by younge men (that lived in hope to have wifes brought over to them, that would save them a laboure to make a voyage to fetch any over) was much distasted, of the precise Sepera∣tists: that keepe much a doe, about the tyth of Muit and Cummin; troubling their braines more then reason would require about things that are indiffe∣rent: and from that time sought occasion against my

honest Host of Ma-re Mount to overthrow his onder∣takings, and to destroy his plantation quite and cleane. But because they presumed with their imaginary gifts (which they have out of Phaos box) they could ex∣pound hidden misteries (to convince them of blindnes as well in this, as in other matters of more cōsequence) I will illustrate the poem, according to the true intent of the authors of these Revells, so much distasted by those Moles.</P>
<P>Oedipus is generally receaved for the absolute reader of riddles who is invoaked: Silla and Caribdis are two dangerous places for seamen to incounter, neere unto vennice, &amp; have bin by poets formerly re∣sembled to man and wife. The like licence the author challenged for a paire of his nomination, the one la∣menting for the losse of the other as Niobe for her children. Amphitrite is an arme of the Sea, by which the newes was carried up and downe, of a rich widow, now to be tane up or laid downe. By Triton is the fame spread, that caused the Suters to muster; (as it had bin to Penellope of Greece) and the Coast lying circuler, all our passage to and froe, is made more convenient by Sea, then Land. Many aimed at this marke; but hee that played Proteus best and could comply with her humor must be the man, that would carry her, &amp; hee had need have Sampsons strenght to deale with a Dal∣lila: and as much patience as Iob that should come there, for a thing that I did observe in the life time o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the former.</P>

<P>And this the whole company of the Revellers at Ma-re Mount, knew to be the true sence and exposi∣tion of the riddle: that was fixed to the Maypole, which the Seperatists were at defiance with? some of them affirmed, that the first institution thereof, was in memory of a whore; not knowing that it was a Trophe erected at first, in honor of Maja, the Lady of learning which they despise; vilifying the two universities with uncivile termes; accounting what is there obtained by studdy is but unnecessary learning; not considering that learninge does inable mens mindes to converse with climents of a higher nature then is to be found within the habitation of the Mole.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of a great Monster supposed to be at Ma-re-Mount; and the preparation made to destroy it.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Seperatists envying the prosperity, and hope of the Plantation at Ma-re Mount (which they per∣ceaved beganne to come forward, and to be in a good way for gaine in the Beaver trade) conspired to∣gether against mine Host especially, (who was the owner of that Plantation) and made up a party a∣gainst him; and mustred up what aide they could; accounting of him, as of a great Monster.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="72"/>Many threatening speeches were given out both against his person, and his Habitation, which they divulged should be consumed with fire: And taking advantage of the time when his company (which see∣med little to regard, theire threats) were gone up into the Inlands, to trade with the Salvages for Beaver.</P>
<P>They set upon my honest host at a place, called Wessaguscus, where (by accident) they found him. The inhabitants there were in good hope, of the sub∣vertion of the plantation at Mare Mount, (which they principally aymed at;) and the rather, because mine host was a man that indeavoured to advaunce the dignity of the Church of England; which they (on the contrary part) would laboure to vilifie; with uncivile termes: enveying against the sacred booke of common prayer, and mine host that used it in a laudable man∣ner amongst his family, as a practise of piety.</P>
<P>There hee would be a meanes to bringe sacks to their mill (such is the thirst after Beaver) and helped the conspiratores to. Surprisee mine host, (who was there all alone) and they chardged him, (be∣cause they would seeme to have some reasonable cause against him (to sett a glosse upon their mallice) with criminall things which indeede had beene done by such a person, but was of their conspiracy; mine host demaunded of the conspirators who it was, that was author of that information, that seemed to be their ground for what they now intended. And because they answer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, they would not tell him, hee as pe∣remptorily replyed, that hee would not stay, whether he had, or he had not done as they had bin informed.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="72"/>The answere made no matter (as it seemed) whe∣ther it had bin negatively, or affirmatively made; for they had resolved what hee should suffer, because (as they boasted,) they were now become the greater number: they had shaked of their shackles of servi∣tude, and were become Masters, and masterles people.</P>
<P>It appeares, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were like beares whelpes in for∣mer time, when mine hosts plantation was of as much strength as theirs, but now (theirs being stronger,) they (like overgrowne beares) seemed monsterous. In breife, mine host must indure to be their prisoner, untill they could contrive it so, that they might send him for England, (as they said,) there to suffer accor∣ding to the merrit of the fact, which they intended to father upon him; supposing (belike) it would proove a hainous crime.</P>
<P>Much rejoycing was made that they had gotten their cappitall enemy (as they concluded him) whome they purposed to hamper in such sort, that hee should not be able to uphold his plantation at Ma-re Mount</P>
<P>The Conspirators sported themselves at my ho∣nest host, that meant them no hurt; &amp; were so joccund that they feasted their bodies, and fell to tippeling, as if they had obtained a great prize; like the Trojans when they had the custody of Hippeus pinetree horse.</P>
<P>Mine host fained greefe: and could not be perswa∣ded either to eate, or drinke, because hee knew emp∣tines would be a meanes to make him as watchfull, as the Geese kept in the Roman Cappitall: whereon the contrary part, the conspirators would be so drowsy, that hee might have an opportunity to give them a
<PB N="140" REF="73"/>
slip, in steade of a tester. Six persons of the conspiracy were set to watch him at Wessaguscus: But hee kept waking;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mine Host got out of prison.</HI></NOTE> and in the dead of night (one lying on the bed, for further suerty,) up gets mine Host, and got to the second dore that hee was to passe which (notwith∣standing the lock) hee got open: and shut it after him with such violence, that it affrighted some of the con∣spirators.</P>
<P>The word which was given with an alarme, was, o he's gon, he's gon, what shall wee doe he's gon? the rest (halfe a sleepe) start up in a maze, and like rames, ran theire heads one at another full butt in the darke.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Captain tore his clothes.</HI></NOTE>Theire grand leader Captaine Shrimp tooke on most furiously, and tore his clothes for anger, to see the empty nest, and their bird gone.</P>
<P>The rest were eager to have torne theire haire from theire heads, but it was so short, that it would give them no hold; Now Captaine Shrimp thought in the losse of this prize (which hee accoumpted his Master peece,) all his honor would be lost for∣ever,</P>
<P>In the meane time mine Host was got home to Ma-re Mount through the woods,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mine Host got home to ma-re mount</HI></NOTE> eight miles, round about the head of the river Monatoquit, that parted the two Plantations: finding his way by the helpe of the lightening (for it thundred as hee went terribly) and there hee prepared powther three pounds dried, for his present imployement,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hee provides for his ene∣mies.</HI></NOTE> and foure good gunnes for him, and the two assistants left at his howse, with bullets of severall sizes three hounderd, or there∣abouts; to be used if the conspirators should pursue
<PB N="141" REF="73"/>
him thether: and these two persons promised theire aides in the quarrell, and confirmed that promise with a health in good rosa solis.</P>
<P>Now Captaine Shrimp, the first Captaine in the Land (as hee supposed,) must doe some new act to repaire this losse, and to vindicate his repu∣tation, who had sustained blemish, by this over∣sight. Begins now to study, how to repaire or sur∣vive his honor in this manner; callinge of Councell: they conclude.</P>
<P>Hee takes eight persons more to him, and (like the nine Worthies of New Canaan) they im∣barque with preparation against Ma-re-Mount, where this Monster of a man (as theire phrase was) had his denne; the whole number, (had the rest not bin from home, being but seaven,) would have given Captaine Shrimpe (a quondam Drum∣mer,) such a wellcome, as would have made him wish for a Drume as bigg as Diogenes tubb, that hee might have crept into it out of sight.</P>
<P>Now the nine Worthies are approached; and mine Host prepared: having intelligence by a Sal∣vage, that hastened in love from Wessaguscus, to give him notice of their intent.</P>
<P>One of mine Hosts men prooved a craven: the other had prooved his wits to purchase a little va∣loure, before mine Host had observed his posture.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="74"/>The nine worthies comming before the Denne of this supposed Monster, (this seaven headed hydra, as they termed him,) and began like Don Quixote against the Windmill to beate a party,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Parly,</HI></NOTE> and to offer quarter (if mine Host would yeald) for they resolved to send him for England, and bad him lay by his armes.</P>
<P>But hee (who was the Sonne of a Souldier) ha∣ving taken up armes in his just defence, replyed, that hee would not lay by those armes, because they were so needefull at Sea, if hee should be sent over. Yet (to save the effusion of so much worty bloud, as would haue issued, out of the vaynes of these 9. wor∣thies of New Canaan, if mine Host should have played upon them out at his port holes (for they came within danger like a flocke of wild geese, as if they had bin tayled one to another, as coults to be sold at a faier) mine Host was content to yeelde upon quarter; and did capitulate with them: in what manner it should be for more certainety, because hee knew what Cap∣taine Shrimpe was.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Captaine Shrimpe pro∣miseth, that no violence should bee offered to his person.</HI></NOTE>Hee expressed, that no violence should be offered to his person, none to his goods, nor any of his Howsehold: but that hee should have his armes, and what els was requisit for the voyage, (which theire Herald retornes,) it was agreed upon, and should be performed.</P>
<P>But mine Host no sooner had set open the dore and issued out: but instantly Captaine Shrimpe, and the rest of the worties stepped to him, layd hold of his armes; and had him downe, and so eagerly was every

man bent against him (not regarding any agreement made with such a carnall man,) that they fell upon him, as if they would have eaten him: some of them were so violent, that they would have a slice with scabbert and all for haste, untill an old Souldier (of the Queenes as the Proverbe is) that was there by accident, clapt his gunne under the weapons, and sharply rebuked these worthies for their unworthy practises.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Worthies rebuked for their unwor∣thy practises.</HI></NOTE> So the matter was taken into more deli∣berate consideration.</P>
<P>Captaine Shrimpe and the rest of the nine wor∣thies, made themselves (by this outragious riot) Masters of mine Hoste of Ma-re Mount, and disposed of what hee had at his plantation.</P>
<P>This they knew (in the eye of the Salvages) would add to their glory; and diminish the reputation of mine honest Host, whome they practised to be ridd of, upon any termes, as willingly as if hee had bin the very Hidra of the time.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe nine Worthies of New Canaan having now the Law in their owne hands (there being no generall

Governour in the Land: nor none of the Seperation that regarded, the duety they owe their Soveraigne, whose naturall borne Subjects they were: though translated out of Holland: from whence they had lear∣ned to worke all to their owne ends, and make a great shew of Religion, but no humanity, for they were now to sit in Counsell on the cause.</P>
<P>And much it stood mine honest Host upon, to be very circumspect, and to take Eacus to taske: for that his voyce was more allowed of, then both the o∣ther: and had not mine Host confounded all the argu∣ments that Eacus could make in their defence: and confuted him that swaied the rest, they would have made him unable to drinke in such manner of merri∣ment any more. So that following this private coun∣sell, given him by one that knew who ruled the rost, the Hiracano ceased that els would split his pinace.</P>
<P>A conclusion was made, and sentence given, that mine Host should be sent to England a prisoner. But when hee was brought to the shipps for that purpose, no man durst be so foole hardy as to undertake to car∣ry him. So these Worthies set mine Host upon an Island, without gunne, powther, or shot, or dogge, or so much as a knife,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mine Host set upon an Island with∣out any thing to shift for himselfe.</HI></NOTE> to get any thinge to feede upon: or any other cloathes to shelter him with at winter, then a thinne suite which hee had one at that time. Home hee could not get to Ma-re-Mount upon this Island. Hee stayed a moneth at least, and was re∣leeved by Salvages that tooke notice that mine Host was a Sachem of Passonagessit, and would bringe bottles of strong liquor to him, and unite them selves
<PB N="145" REF="75"/>
into a league of brother hood with mine Host; so full of humanity are these infidels before those Chri∣stians.</P>
<P>From this place for England, sailed mine Host in a Plimmoth shipp, (that came into the Land to fish upon the Coast,) that landed him safe in England at Plimmouth, and hee stayed in England untill the ordinary time for shipping to set forth for these parts; and then retorned: Noe man being able to taxe him of any thinge.</P>

<HEAD>THE ILLVSTRATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>NOw to illustrate this Poem, and make the sence more plaine, it is to be considered that the Per∣sons at Ma-re-Mount were seaven, and they had sea∣ven heads and 14. feete, these were accounted Hi∣dra with the seaven heads; and the Maypole with the Hornes nailed neere the topp, was the forked tayle of this supposed Monster, which they (for want of skill) imposed: yet feared in time (if they hindred not mine Host) hee would hinder the benefit of their Beaver trade, as hee had done (by meanes of this helpe) in Kyny back river finely, ere they were a wares▪ who comming too late, were much dismaide to finde that mine Host his boate had gleaned away all before they came; which Beaver is a fitt companion for Scarlett: and I beleeve that Iasons golden Fleece was either the same, or some other Fleece not of so much value.</P>
<P>This action bred a kinde of hart burning in the Plimmouth Planters who after, sought occasion a∣gainst mine Host to overthrowe his undertakings, and to destroy his Plantation, whome they ac∣coumpted a maine enemy to theire Church and State.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="78"/>Now when they had begunne with him, they thought best to proceede: for asmuch as they thought them selves farre enough from any controule of Iu∣stice; and therefore resolved to be their owne carvers: (and the rather, because they presumed upon some incouragement they had from the favourites of their Sect in England:) and with fire and sword nine in number pursued mine Host; who had escaped theire hands in scorne of what they intended, and betooke him to his habitation in a night of great thunder and lightening, when they durst not follow him, as har∣dy, as these nine worthies seemed to be.</P>
<P>It was in the Moneth of Iune, that these Mar∣shallists had appointed to goe about this mischeifous project, and deale so crabbidly with mine Host.</P>
<P>After a parly, hee capitulated with them about the quarter, they proffered him, if hee would con∣sent to goe for England, there to answere (as they pretended) some thing they could object against him principall to the generall: But what it would be hee cared not, neither was it any thing materiall.</P>
<P>Yet when quarter was agreed upon, they con∣trary wise, abused him, and carried him to theire towne of Plimmouth, where (if they had thought hee durst have gone to England) rather then they would have bin any more affronted by him, they would have dispatched him, as Captaine Shrimp in a rage, profest that hee would doe with his Pistoll as mine Host should set his foote into the boate. How∣soever the cheife Elders voyce in that place was more powerfull than any of the rest; who concluded
<PB N="151" REF="78"/>
to send mine Host without any other thing to be done to him. And this being the finall agreement, (con∣trary to Shrimpe and others,) the nine Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thies had a great Feast made, and the furmity po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was provided, for the boats gang by no allowance: and all manner of pastime.</P>
<P>Captaine Shrimpe was so overjoyed in the per∣formance of this exployt; that they had, at that time, extraordinary merriment; a thing not usuall amongst those presisians) and when the winde served, they tooke mine Host into their Shallop; hoysed Saile, and carried him to the Northen parts; where they left him upon a Island.</P>

<P>Of a Doctor made at a Commencement in Nevv Canaan.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Church of Plimmouth having due regard to the weale publike, and the Brethren, that were to come over; and knowing that they would be busi∣ly imployed to make provision for the cure of Soules, and therefore might neglect the body for that time: did hold themselves to be in duety bound, to make search for a fitting man that might be able, (if so neede requir'd) to take the chardge upon him in that place of imployment:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Councell called.</HI></NOTE> and therefore called a Coun∣sell of the whole Synagoge: amongst which company they chose out a man, that long time had bin nurst up in the tender bosome of the Church: one that had
<PB N="152" REF="79"/>
speciall gifts: hee could wright and reade, nay more: hee had tane the oath of abjuration, which is a spe∣ciall stepp, yea and a maine degree unto perferment, Him they weane: and out of Phaos boxe fitt him with speciall guifts of no lesse worth: they stile him Doctor and forth they send him to gaine imployement and o∣pinion.</P>
<P>What luck is it I cannot hit on his name: but I will give you him by a periphrasis, that you may know him when you meete him next.</P>
<P>Hee was borne at Wrington in the County of Somerset, where hee was bred a Butcher. Hee weares a longe beard, and a Garment like the Greeke that beggd in Pauls Church. This new made Do∣ctor comes to Salem to congratulate: where hee findes some are newly come from Sea, and ill at ease.</P>
<P>Hee takes the patient, and the urinall: vies the State there: findes the Crasis Syptomes, and the at∣tomi natantes: and tells the patient that his disease was winde, which hee had tane by gapeing, feasting, o∣ver board at Sea, but hee would quickly ease him of that greife, and quite expell the winde. And this hee did performe, with his gifts hee had: and then hee handled the patient so handsomely, that hee ea∣sed him of all the winde, hee had in an instant.</P>
<P>And yet I hope this man may be forgiven, if hee were made a fitting Plant for Heaven.</P>
<P>How hee went to worke with his gifts is a question: yet hee did a great cure for Captaine Littleworth, hee cured him of a disease called a wife: and yet I hope this man may be forgiven, if shee were made a fitting plant for heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="79"/>By this meanes hee was allowed 4. p. a moneth, and the chirgeons chest, and made Phisition gene∣rall of Salem: where hee exercised his gifts so well, that of full 42. that there hee tooke to cure, there is not one has more cause to complaine, or can say black's his eie. This saved Captaine Littleworths credit, that had truck'd away the vittels: though it brought forth a scandall on the Country by it, and then I hope this man may be forgiven, if they were all made fitting plants for Heaven.</P>
<P>But in mine opinion, hee deserves to be set upon a palfrey, and lead up and downe in triumph throw new Canaan, with a coller of Iurdans about his neck, as was one of like desert in Richard the seconds time through the streets of London, that men might know where to finde a Quacksaluer.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>A silenced Minister out of courteousnesse, came over into new Canaan to play the spie: Hee pretended out of a zealous intent to doe the Salvages good, and to teach them. Hee brought a great Bundell of Horne books with him, and carefull hee was (good man) to blott out all the crosses of them, for feare least the people of the land should become Idolaters. Hee was in hope, with his gifts, to prepare a great au∣ditory against greate Iosua should arive there.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="80"/>Hee applyed himselfe on the weeke dayes to the trade of Beaver, but it was (as might seeme) to pur∣chase the principall benefite of the Lande, when the time should come; for hee had a hope to be the Cai∣phas of the Country: and well hee might, for hee was higher by the head than any of his tribe that came after him.</P>
<P>This man, it seemes, played the spie very hand∣somely, For in the exercise of his guifts on the Lords day at Weenasimute,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>This Caiphas that con∣demneth Co∣vetousnesse, and commit∣teth it him∣selfe.</HI></NOTE> hee espied a Salvage come in with a good Beaver coate, and tooke occa∣sion to reproove the covetous desire of his auditory to trade for Beaver on those dayes; which made them all use so much modesty about the matter for the pre∣sent, that hee found opportunity, the same day, to take the Salvage a side into a corner, where (with the helpe of his Wampampeack, hee had in his pocket for that purpose in a readinesse,) hee made a shifte to get that Beaver coate, which their mouthes wa∣tered at; and so deceaved them all.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Practise of the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>peratists to gett a snare to hamper mine Host of Ma-re-Mount.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ALthough the nine Worthies had left mine Hoste upon an Island, in such an inhumane manner, as yee heard before; yet when they understood that hee had got shipping, and was gone to England of his owne accord, they dispatched letters of advise to an Agent they had there: and by the next shipp sent af∣ter, to have a snare made, that might hamper mine Host so, as hee might not any more trouble theire conscience: and to that end,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The generall collection made.</HI></NOTE> made a generall collec∣tion of Beaver to defray the chardge, and hee was not thought a good Christian that would not lay much out, for that imployment.</P>
<P>Some contributed three pounds; some foure, some five pounds, and procured a pretty quantity by that Devise, which should be given to a cunning man, that could make a snare to hamper him.</P>
<P>The Agent (according to his directions,) does his endeavoure (in the best manner hee could) to have this instrument made: and used no little diligence to have it effected.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Noe cost spa∣red for the getting of a skillfull man</HI></NOTE> His reputation stood upon the taske imposed upon him against mine Host, the one∣ly enemy (accounted) of their Church, and State.</P>
<P>Much inquiry was made in London, and about, for a skillfull man that would worke the feate. Noe cost
<PB N="156" REF="81"/>
was spared, for gold hee had good store, first hee in∣quires of one: and then another: at the last hee heard newes of a very famous man, one that was excellent at making subtile instruments such as that age had never bin acquainted with.</P>
<P>Hee was well knowne to be the man, that had wit and wondrous skill, to make a cunning instrument, where with to save himselfe, and his whole family: if all the world besides should be drown'd; and this the best, yea and the best cheap too; for no good done, the man would nothing take.</P>
<P>To him this agent goes, and praies his aide: De∣clares his cause, &amp; tells the substance of his greivance, all at large, and laid before his eies a heape of gold.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The heape of gold.</HI></NOTE>When all was shewd, that could be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he'd, and said what could be said, &amp; all too little for to have it done; the agent then did see his gold refused, his cause despi∣sed &amp; thought himselfe disgraced, to leave the worke undone: so that hee was much dismaid, yet importun'd the cunning, who found no reason to take the taske in hand.</P>
<P>Hee thought perhaps, mine Host (that had the slight to escape from the nine Worthies, to chaine Ar∣gus eies, and by inchauntment make the doores of the watch tower fly open at an instant) would not be ham∣perd, but with much a doe: and so hee was unwilling to be troubled with that taske.</P>
<P>The agent wondring to see that his gold would doe no good, did aske, the cunning man if hee could give him no advise? who said, hee would: and what was that thinke you? To let mine Host alone, who
<PB N="157" REF="81"/>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the meane time, whiles these former passages were: There was a great swelling fellow, of Little∣worth, crept over to Salem (by the helpe of Master Charter party the Tresorer,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Charter par∣ty Treasor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r.</HI></NOTE> and Master Ananias in∣crease the Collector for the Company of Seperatists,) to take upon him their imployments for a time.</P>
<P>Hee resolving to make hay, whiles the Sonne did shine, first pretended himselfe to be sent over as cheife Iustice of the Massachussets Bay, and Salem forsoth, and tooke unto him a counsell &amp; a worthy one no doubt; For the Cow keeper of Salem, was a prime man in those imployments; and to ad a Majesty (as hee thought) to his new assumed dignity, hee caused the Patent of the Massachussets (new brought into the Land) to be carried where hee went in his progresse to and froe, as an embleme of his authority: which
<PB N="158" REF="82"/>
the vulgar people not acquainted with, thought it to be some instrument of Musick locked up in that co∣vered case, and thought (for so some said) this man of littleworth had bin a fidler, and the rather, because hee had put into the mouthes of poore silly things that were sent a longe with him, what skill hee had in En∣gines and in things of quaint devise: all which proo∣ved in conclusion to be but impostury.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Warrants made by Capt.

<P>To these Articles every Planter, old, and new, must signe: or be expelled from any manner of aboade within the Compas of the Land contained within that graunt then shewed: which was so large, it would suffice for Elbow roome, for more then were in all the Land by 700000. such an army might have planted them a Colony with that cirquit which hee challenged. and not contend for roome for their Cat∣tell. But for all that, hee that should refuse to sub∣scribe, must pack.</P>
<P>The tenor of the <HI>Articles</HI> were these: <HI>That in all
<PB N="159" REF="82"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>auses, as well Ecclesiasticall, as Politicall, wee should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ollow the rule of Gods word.</HI></P>
<P>This made a shew of a good intent, and all the assembly (onely mine Host replyed) did subscribe:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mine Host subscribed not.</HI></NOTE> hee would not unlesse they would ad this Caution: <HI>So as nothing be done contrary, or repugnant to the Lawes of the Kingdome of England.</HI> These words hee knew, by former experience, were necessary, and without these, the same would proove a very mousetrapp to catch some body by his owne consent, (which the rest nothing suspected) for the construction of the worde would be made by them of the Seperation, to serve their owne turnes: and if any man should, in such a case be accused of a crime (though in it selfe it were petty) they might set it on the tenter hookes of their imaginary gifts, and stretch it, to make it seeme cappitall; which was the reason why mine Host refu∣sed to subscribe.</P>
<P>It was then agreed upon, that there should be one generall trade used within that Patent (as hee said) and a generall stock: and every man to put in a parte:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Patent.</HI></NOTE> and every man, for his person, to have shares alike: and for their stock according to the ratable propor∣tion was put in: and this to continue for 12. moneths: and then to call an accompt.</P>
<P>All were united but mine Host refused: two truckmasters were chosen; wages prefixed;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>All consented but mine Host.</HI></NOTE> onely mine Host put in a Caviat, that the wages might be payed out of the cleare proffit, which there in black and white was plainely put downe.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="83"/>But before the end of 6. moneths, the partners in this stock (handled by the Truckmasters) would have an accoumpt: some of them had perceaved that Wampambeacke could be pocketted up, and the un∣derlings (that went in the boats alonge) would be neere the Wiser for any thinge, but what was trucked for Beaver onely.</P>

<P>But mine Host that sturred not his foote at all for the matter, did not onely save his stock from such a Cancar, but gained sixe and seaven for one: in the meane time, hee derided the Contributers for being catch'd in that snare.</P>

<P>CAptaine Littleworth (that had an akeing tooth at at mine Host of Ma-re-Mount,) devised how hee might put a trick upon him, by colour of a Sequestra∣tion, and got some persons to pretend that hee had corne, and other goods of theirs in possession; and the
<PB N="161" REF="83"/>
rather, because mine Host had store of corne; and hee had improvidently truckt his store, for the present gaine of Beaver: in somuch, that his people under his chardge were put to short allowance; which caused some of them to sicken with conceipt of such useage: and some of them (by the practise of the new entertai∣ned Doctor Noddy, with his Imaginary gifts: They sent therefore to exhibit a petition to grim Minos, Ea∣cus, and Radamant: where they wished to have the au∣thor of their greife to be converted: and they had pro∣cured it quickly: if curses would have caused it: for good prayers would be of no validity (as they suppo∣sed) in this extremity.</P>
<P>Now in this extremity Capt.

<P>THere was a zealous Professor in the Land of Ca∣naan (growne a great Merchant in the Beaver trade) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat came over for his conscience sake, (as other men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave done) and the meanes: (as the phrase is) who in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is minority had bin prentice to a tombe maker; who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omming to more ripenes of yeares (though lesse dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>retion,) found a kinde of scruple in his conscience, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat the trade was in parte against the second com∣mandement: and therefore left it off wholely, and be∣tooke himselfe to some other imployments.</P>
<P>In the end hee settled upon this course: where hee had hope of preferrement, and become one of those things that any Iudas might hange himselfe upon,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Elder.</HI></NOTE> that is an Elder.</P>
<P>Hee had bin a man of some recconing in his time (as himselfe would boast) for hee was an officer, just <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nder the ExChequer at Westminster, in a place called Phlegeton: there hee was comptroller, and conversed with noe plebeians I tell you: but such as have angels for their attendance, (I meane some Lawyers, with ap∣pertenances (that is Clarks,) with whome a Iugg of Beare, and a crusty rolle in the terme, is as cur∣rant as a three penny scute at Hall time.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="86"/>There is another place, thereby called sticks: these are to two daingerous places, by which the in∣fernall gods doe sweare: but this of Sticks is the more daingerous of the two, because there, (if a man be once in) hee cannot tell how to get out againe hand∣somely.</P>
<P>I knew an under sheriff was in unawaires, and hee laboured to be free of it: yet hee broake his back be∣fore hee got so farre as quietus est: There is no such dainger in Phlegeton, where this man of so much rec∣coning was comptroller.</P>
<P>Hee being here, waited an opportunity to be made a gentl. and, now it fell out that a gentl. new∣ly come into the land of Canaan (before hee knew what ground hee stood upon) had incurred the displea∣sure of great Iosua so highly,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iosua dis∣pleased.</HI></NOTE> that hee must therefore be digraded.</P>
<P>No reconciliation could be had for him: all hopes were past for that matter: Where upon this man of much recconing (pretending a graunt of the ap∣proach in avoydance) helpes the lame dogge over the stile; and was as jocund on the matter as a Magpie o∣ver a Mutton.</P>
<P>Wherefore the Heralls with Drums, and Trum∣pets, proclaiming in a very solemne manner, that it was the pleasure of great Iosua (for divers and sundry very good causes and considerations,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Master Temperwell.</HI></NOTE> Master Tem∣perwell there unto especially mooving) to take away the title, prerogative and preheminence of the De∣linquent, so unworthy of it, and to place the same up∣on a Professor of more recconing: so that it was made
<PB N="167" REF="86"/>
a penall thing for any man after, to lifte the same man againe on the top of that stile: but that hee should stand perpetually digraded from that preroga∣tive. And the place by this meanes being voyde, this man of so much more reckoning, was receaved in like a Cypher to fillup a roome, and was made a Gentleman of the first head; and his Coate of Armes blazon'd and tricked out fit for that purpose, in this Poem following.<Q><LG>

Charterparty, that this man was a member of the Church of England: and therefore (in their account) an enemy to their Church, &amp; state. And (to the end they might have some coloure against him) some of them practised to get into his debte; which hee not mistrusting suffered: and gave credit for such Commodity as hee had sold at a price. When the day of payment came, insteede of monyes; hee being at that time sick and weake,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Good Paye∣ment.</HI></NOTE> and stood in neede of the Beaver hee had contracted for hee, had an Epistle full of zealous exhortations, to provide for the soule, and
<PB N="169" REF="87"/>
not to minde these transitory things that perished with the body; and to be thinke himselfe whether his con∣science would be so prompt to demaund so greate a somme of Beaver as had bin contracted for. Hee was further exhorted therein, to consider hee was but a steward for a time, and by all likely hood was going to to give up an accompt of his stewardship: and therfore perswaded the creditor not to load his conscience with such a burthen, which hee was bound by the Gospell to ease him of (if it were possible) &amp; for that cause hee had framed this Epistle in such a freindly maner to put him in minde of it. The perusall of this (lap'd in the paper) was as bad as a portion, to the creditor, to see his debtor Mast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Subtilety a zealous professor (as hee thought) to deride him in this extremity, that hee could not chuse (in ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iration of the deceipt) but cast out these words:</P>

<P>This was called in question, when M<SUP>r</SUP>. Fairecloath least thought of it. Capt.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Charity of the Seperatists.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>CHarity is sayd to be the darling of Religion and is indeed the Marke of a good Christian: But where we doe finde a Commission for ministring to the ne∣cessity of the Saints, we doe not finde any pro∣hibition against casting our bread upon the waters, where the unsanctified, as well as the sanctified, are in possibility to make use of it.</P>
<P>I cannot perceave that the Seperatists doe allowe of helping our poore though they magnify their pra∣cti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in contributing to the nourishment of their Saints For a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> much as some that are of the number of those whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey terme without (though it were in case of sicknesse) upon theire l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nding, when a little fresh

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the practise of their Church.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Church of the Seperatists, is governed by Pastors, Elders, and Deacons, and there is not
<PB N="173" REF="89"/>
any of these (thouh hee be but a Cow keeper) but is allowed to exercise his guifts, in the publik assembly on the Lords day; so as hee doe not make use of any notes for the helpe of his memory: for such things they say smell of Lampe oyle, and there must be no such unsavery perfume admitted, to come into the congregation.</P>
<P>These are all publike preachers. There is amongst these people a Deakonesse made of the sisters, that uses her guifts at home in an assembly of her sexe, by way of repetition, or exhortation: such is their practise.</P>
<P>The Pastor (before hee is allowed of) must dis∣claime his former calling to the Ministry, as hereticall; and take a new calling after their fantasticall inven∣tions: and then hee is admitted to bee their Pastor.</P>
<P>The manner of disclaimeing is, to renounce hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> calling with bitter execrations, for the time that hee hath heretofore lived in it: and after his new e∣lection, there is great joy conceaved at his com∣mission.</P>
<P>And theire Pastors have this preheminence above the Civile Magistrate: Hee must first con∣sider of the complaint, made against a mem∣ber: and if hee be disposed to give the partie complained of, an admonition, there is no more to be said: if not; Hee delivers him over to the Magistrate to deale with him, in a course of Iustice, according to theire practise, in cases of that na∣ture.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="90"/>Of these pastors I have not knowne many: some I have observed; together with theire carriage in New Canaan: and can informe you what opinion hath bin conceaved of theire conditions, in the perti∣culer. There is one who (as they give it out there, that thinke they speake it to advaunce his worth) has bin expected to exercise his gifts in an assem∣bly, that stayed his comming, (in the middest of his Iorney) falls into a fitt (which they terme a zealous meditation) and was 4. miles past the place appointed, before hee came to him selfe, or did remember where abouts hee went. And how much these things are dif∣ferent from the actions of mazed men, I leave to any indifferent man to judge: and if I should say, they are all much alike, they that have seene and heard, what I have done will not condemme mee altogether.</P>
<P>Now, for as much as by the practise of theire Church every Elder or Deacon may preach: it is not amisse to discover their practise in that perticuler, be∣fore I part with them.</P>
<P>It has bin an old saying, and a true, what is bred in the bone, will not out of the flesh, nor the stepping into the pulpit that can make the person fitt for the imployment. The unfitnes of the person undertaking to be the Messenger, has brought a blemi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h upon the message, as in the time of Lewes the Eleventh King of France;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lewes the</HI> II <HI>sent a Barber Em∣bassador.</HI></NOTE> who (having advaunced his Barber to place of Honor, and graced him with eminent titles) made him so presumptuous, to undertake an Embassage to treat with forraine princes of Civile affaires.</P>
<P>But what was the issue? Hee behaved himselfe so
<PB N="175" REF="90"/>
unworthily (yet as well as his breeding would give him leave) that both the Messenger and the message were despised;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Embas∣sage despise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI></NOTE> and had not hee (being discovered) con∣veyed himselfe out of their territories, they had made him pay for his barbarous presumption.</P>
<P>Socrates sayes, <HI>loquere ut te videam.</HI> If a man ob∣serve these people in the exercise of their gifts, hee may thereby discerne the tincture of their proper cal∣ling, the asses eares will peepe through the lyons hide. I am sorry they cannot discerne their owne infirmities I will deale fairely with them; for I will draw their pi∣ctures cap a pe, that you may discerne them plainely from head to foote in their postures that so much be∣witch (as I may speake with mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esty,) these illiterate people to be so fantasticall, to take Ionas taske upon them without sufficient warrant.</P>
<P>One steps up like the Minister of Iustice with the ballance onely,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Grocer.</HI></NOTE> not the sword for feare of affrighting his auditory. Hee poynts at a text, and handles it as e∣venly as hee can; and teaches the auditory, that the thing hee has to deliver; must be well waied, for it is a very pretious thing, yet much more pretious then gold, or pearle: and hee will teach them the meanes how to way things of that excellent worth: that a man would suppose, hee, and his auditory were to part stakes by the scale; and the like distribution they have used about a bag pudding.</P>
<P>Another (of a more cutting disposition) steps in his steed; and hee takes a text,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A taylor.</HI></NOTE> which hee devides into many parts: (to speake truly) as many as hee list. The fag end of it hee pares away, as a superfluous remnant.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="91"/>Hee puts his auditory in comfort, that hee will make a garment for them: and teach them how they shall put it on; and incourages them to be in love with it, for it is of such a fashion as doth best become a Chri∣stian man. Hee will assuer them that it shall be armor of proffe against all assaults of Satan. This garment (sayes hee) is not composed as the garments made by a carnall man, that are sowed with a hot needle, and a burning thread; but it is a garment that shall out last all the garments: and (if they will make use of it, as hee shall direct them) they shall be able like saint George) to terrifie the greate Dragon error; and defend truth which error with her wide chaps, would devoure: whose mouth shall be filled with the shredds, and parings, which hee continually gapes for under the cutting bourd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Tapste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE>A third, hee supplies the rome: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd in the exercise of his guifts begins with a text <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat is drawne out of a fountaine, that has in it no dreggs of popery. This shall proove unto you (says hee) the Cup of repentance; it is not like unto the Cup of the Whore of Babilon, who will make men drunk with the dreggs thereof: It is filled up to the brim with comfortable joyce, and will proove a cordiall, a comfortable cordiall to a sick soule, (sayes hee,) And so hee handles the matter as if hee dealt by the pinte, and the quarte with Nic and Froth.</P>
<P>An other (a very learned man indeed) goes an∣other way to worke with his auditory;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Cobler.</HI></NOTE> and exhorts them to walke upright, in the way of their calling, and not (like carnall men) tread awry. And if they should

fayle in the performance of that duety, yet they should seeke for amendement whiles it was time; and tells them, it would bee to late to seek for help, when the shop windowes were shutt up: and pricks them for∣ward with a freindly admonition, not to place theire delight in worldly pleasures, which will not last, but in time will come to an end.</P>
<P>But so to handle the matter, that they may be found to wax better and better, and then they shall be doublely rewarded for theire worke: and so closes up the matter in a comfortable manner.</P>
<P>But stay: Here is one stept up in haste, and (being not minded to hold his auditory in expecta∣tion of any long discourse,) hee takes a text; and (for brevities sake,) divides it into one part: and then runnes so fast a fore with the matter, that his audito∣ry cannot follow him.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A very pato∣rick.</HI></NOTE> Doubtles his Father was some Irish footeman, by his speede it seemes so.

<P>Well, if you marke it, these are speciall gifts in∣deede: which the vulgar people are so taken with, that there is no perswading them that it is so ridiculous.</P>
<P>This is the meanes, (O the meanes,) that they pursue: This that comes without premedi∣tation: This is the Suparlative: and hee that does not approove of this, they say is a very reprobate.</P>

<P>THe Seperatists (after they had burned Ma-re-Mount, they could not get any shipp to under∣take the carriage of mine Host from thence, either by faire meanes, or fowle,) they were inforced (contrary to their expectation) to be troubled with his compa∣ny: and by that meanes had time to consider more of the man, then they had done of the matter: wherein at length it was discovered, that they (by meanes of their credulity of the intelligence given them in Eng∣land of the matter, and the false Carecter of the man) had runne themselves headlonge into an error: and had done that on a sodaine, which they repented at leasure: but could not tell which way to help it
<PB N="181" REF="93"/>
as it stood now. They could debate upon it; and espe∣cially upon two difficult points, whereof one must be concluded upon. If they sent mine Host a way by ba∣nishment, hee is in possibility to survive, to their dis∣grace for the injury done: if they suffer him to stay, &amp; put him in <HI>statu quo prius,</HI> all the vulgar people will conclude they have bin too rashe in burning a howse that was usefull, and count them men unadvised.</P>
<P>So that it seemes (by theire discourse about the matter) they stood betwixt Hawke and Bussard: and could not tell which hand to incline unto. They had sounded him secretly: hee was content with it, goe which way it would. Nay shackles himselfe, (who was imployed in the burning of the howse, and therefore feared to be caught in England) and others were so for∣ward in putting mine Host <HI>in statu quo prius,</HI> after they had found their error, (which was so apparent that Luceus eies would have served to have found it out in lesse time) that they would contribute 40. shillings a peece towards it; and affirmed, that every man accor∣ding to his ability that had a hand in this black designe should be taxed to a Contribution in like nature: it would be done exactly.</P>
<P>Now (whiles this was in agitation, &amp; was well ur∣ged by some of those partys, to have bin the upshot) un∣expected (in the depth of winter, when all shipps were gone out of the land) In comes M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Wethercock a pro∣per Mariner; and they said; he could observe the winde: blow it high, blow it low, hee was resolved to lye at hull rather than incounter such a storme as mine Host had met with: and this was a man for their turne.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="94"/>Hee would doe any office for the brethren, if they (who hee knew had a strong purse, and his conscience waited on the strings of it, if all the zeale hee had) would beare him out in it: which they professed they would. Hee undertakes to ridd them of mine Host by one meanes or another. They gave him the best meanes they could, according to the present condi∣tion of the worke; and letters of credence to the fa∣voures of that Sect in England; with which (his busines there being done, and his shipp cleared) hee hoyst the Sayles, and put to Sea: since which time mine Host has not troubled the brethren, but onely at the Counsell table: where now Sub indice lis est.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of Sir Christopher Gardiner Knight, and hovv hee spedd amongst the Seperatists.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SIr Christopher Gardiner, (a Knight, that had bin a traveller, both by Sea and Land; a good judicious gentleman in the Mathematticke, and other Sciences usefull for Plantations Kimistry, &amp;c. and also being a practicall Enginer) came into those parts, intending discovery.</P>
<P>But the Seperatists love not those good parts, when they proceede from a carnall man (as they call every good Protestant,) in shorte time had found the meanes to pick a quarrell with him. The meanes is, that they pursue to obtaine what they aime at: the word is there the meanes.</P>
<P>So that when they finde any man like to proove an enemy to their Church, and state, then straight
<PB N="183" REF="94"/>
the meanes must be used for defence. The first pre∣cept in their Politiques is, to defame the man at whom they aime. and then hee is a holy Israelite in their opi∣nions, who can spread that fame brodest, like butter upon a loafe: no matter how thin; it will serve for a vaile: and then this man (who they have thus depra∣ved) is a spotted uncleane leaper: hee must out, least hee pollute the Land, and them that are cleane.</P>
<P>If this be one of their guifts, then Machevill had as good gifts as they. Let them raise a scandall on any, though never so innocent; yet they know it is never wiped cleane out: the staind marks remaines: which hath bin well observed by one, in these words of his:
<Q><L>Stick Candles gainst a Virgin walls white back:</L>
<L>If they'l not burne yet at the least they'l black.</L></Q>
And thus they dealt with Sir Christopher: and plot∣ted by all the wayes, and meanes they could, to over∣throw his undertakings in those parts.</P>
<P>And therefore I cannot chuse, but conclude, that these Seperatists have speciall gifts: for they are given to envy, and malllice extremely.</P>
<P>The knowledge of their defamacion could not please the gentleman well, when it came to his eare, which would cause him to make some reply, (as they supposed) to take exceptions at, as they did against Faire cloath: &amp; this would be a meanes, they thought, to blow the coale, and so to kindle a brand that might fire him out of the Country too, and send him after mine Host of Ma-re-Mount.</P>
<P>They take occasion (some of them) to come to his howse when hee was gone up into the Country: and
<PB N="184" REF="95"/>
finding hee was from home) so went to worke, that they left him neither howse, nor habitation, nor ser∣vant, nor any thing to help him, if hee should retorne: but of that they had noe hope (as they gave it out) for hee was gone (as they affirmed) to leade a Salvage life; and for that cause tooke no company with him: and they, having considered of the matter, thought it not fit that any such man should live in so remoate a place, within the Compas of their patent. So they fired the place; and carried away the persons, and goods.</P>
<P>Sir Christopher was gone with a guide (a Salvage) into the inland parts for discovery: but, before hee was returned, hee met with a Salvage that told the guide, Sir Christopher would be killed: Master Tem∣perwell (who had now found out matter against him) would have him dead, or alive. This hee related; and would have the gentleman not to goe to the place ap∣pointed, because of the danger, that was supposed.</P>
<P>But Sir Christopher was nothing dismaid: hee would on, whatsoever come of it; and so met with the Salvages: and betweene them was a terrible sker∣mish: But they had the worst of it, and hee scaped well enough.</P>
<P>The guide was glad of it, and learnd of his fel∣lowes that they were promised a great reward, for what they should doe in this imployment.</P>
<P>Which thing (when Sir Christopher understood,) hee gave thanks to God; and after (upon this occasion, to sollace himselfe) in his table booke, hee composed this sonnet, which I have here inserted for a memo∣riall.<Q><PB N="185" REF="95"/><LG>
<HEAD>THE SONNET.</HEAD>
<L>WOlfes in Sheeps clothing why will ye,</L>
<L>Think to deceave God that doth see,</L>
<L>Your simulated sartity.</L>
<L>For my part I doe wish you could,</L>
<L>Your owne infirmities behold,</L>
<L>For then you would not be so bold,</L>
<L>Like Sophists why will you dispute,</L>
<L>With wisdome so, you doe confute,</L>
<L>None but your selves: for shame be mute.</L>
<L>Least great Jehovah with his powre,</L>
<L>Do come upon you in an howre,</L>
<L>When you least think and you devoure.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>This Sonnet the Gentleman composed, as a testimo∣ny of his love towards them, that were so ill affected towards him; from whome they might have receaved much good, if they had bin so wise to have imbraced him in a loving fashion.</P>
<P>But they despise the helpe, that shall come from a carnall man (as they termed him) who (after his retorne from those designes) finding how they had used him with such disrespect, tooke shipping, and dis∣posed of himselfe for England, and discovered their practises in those parts towards his Majesties true har∣ted Subjects, which they made wery of their aboade in those parts.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of mine Host of Ma-re-Mount hovv hee played Io∣nas after hee had bin in the Whales belly for a time.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Host of Ma-re-Mount being put to Sea, had delivered him, for his releefe by the way, (be∣cause the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ipp was unvitteled, and the Seamen put to straight allowance, which could hold out, but to the Canaries) a part of his owne provision, being two moneths proportion, in all but 3. small peeces of porke; which made him expect to be famished before the voyage should be ended, by all likelyhood. Yet hee thought hee would make one good meale, before hee died: like the Colony servant in Virginea, that before hee should goe to the gallowes) called to his wife to set on the loblolly pot, and let him have one good meale before hee went; who had committed a petty crime, that in those dayes, was made a cappitall offence.</P>
<P>And now mine Host being merrily disposed, on went the peeces of porke, where with hee feasted his body, and cherished the poore Sailers: and got out of them what M<SUP>r</SUP>. Wethercock, their Master purposed to doe with him that hee had no more provision: &amp; along they sailed from place to place, from Iland to Iland, in a pittifull wether beaten ship; where mine Host was in more dainger (without all question) then Ionas, when hee was in the Whales belly; and it was the great mer∣cy of God that they had not all perished. Vittelled they were but for a moneth when they wayd Ancor, and left the first port.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="96"/>They were a pray for the enemy for want of powther, if they had met them: besides the vessell was a very slugg, and so unserviceable, that the Master called a counsell of all the company in generall, to have theire opinions, which way to goe, and how to beare the helme, who all under their hand affirmed the shipp to be unserviceable: so that in fine the Master, and men, and all were at their wits end about it: yet they im∣ployed the Carpenters to search, and caulke her sides, and doe theire best whiles they were in her. Nine moneths they made a shifte to use her, and shifted for supply of vittells at all the Islands they touched at; though it were so poorely, that all those helpes, and the short allowance of a bisket a day, and a few Lymons taken in at the Canaries, served but to bring the vessell in view of the lands end.</P>
<P>They were in such a desperat case, that (if God in his greate mercy had not favoured them, and dis∣posed the windes faire untill the vessell was in Plim∣mouth roade,) they had without question perished; for when they let drop an Anchor, neere the Island of S. Michaels not one bit of foode left for all that starving allowance of this wretched wethercock; that if hee would have lanched out his beaver, might have bought more vittells in New England then he &amp; the whole ship with the Cargazoun was worth, (as the passingers hee carried who vittelled themselves affirmed,) But hee played the miserable wretch, &amp; had possessed his men with the contrary; who repented them of waying an∣chor before they knew so much.</P>
<P>Mine Host of Ma-re-Mount (after hee had bin in
<PB N="188" REF="97"/>
the Whales belly) was set a shore to see if hee would now play Ionas, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> metamorphosed with a longe voy∣age, that hee looked like Lazarus in the painted cloath.</P>
<P>But mine Host (after due consideration of the premisses) thought it fitter for him to play Ionas in this kinde, then for the Seperatists to play Ionas in that kinde as they doe. Hee therefore bid Wethercock tell the Seperatists, that they would be made in due time to repent those malitious practises, and so would hee too; for hee was a Seperatist amongst the Sepera∣tists as farre as his wit would give him leave; though when hee came in Company of basket makers, hee would doe his indevoure to make them pinne the basket, if hee could, as I have seene him. And now mine Host being merrily disposed, haveing past many perillous adventures in that desperat Whales belly, be∣ganne in a posture like Ionas, and cryed Repent you cruell Seperatists repent, there are as yet but 40. dayes if Iove vouchsafe to thunder, Charter and the King∣dome of the Seperatists will fall a sunder: Repent you cruell Schismaticks repent. And in that posture hee greeted them by letters retorned into new Canaan; and ever (as opportunity was fitted for the purpose) he was both heard &amp; seene in the posture of Ionas against thē crying repent you cruel Seperatists, repent, there are as yet but 40. dayes if Iove vouchsafe to thunder. The Charter and the Kingdome of the Seperatists will fall a sunder: Repent you cruell Schismaticks repent; If you will heare any more of this proclamation meete him at the next market towne, for <HI>Cynthius aurem vellet.</HI></P>
