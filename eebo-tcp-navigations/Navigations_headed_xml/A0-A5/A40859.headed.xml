<L>It's no Colchester Bull nor yet Mad' Ox,</L>

<L>Should after death bring forth a monstrous Child.</L>

<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="declaration">
<HEAD>The Declarations of <HI>Mrs.</HI> Rump, lying very weak, and in most grievous Pangs of Child-bearing; and cannot be Delivered.</HEAD>
<P>Whatsoever dangers are threatned or feared, either by the great perplexity I am at this present in (or by reason of my manifold sins that now in my weakness lie heavy upon my Conscience,) yet I have assurance, that if I confess and forsake them <HI>(as I have no such inten∣tion)</HI> I shall find mercy.</P>
<P>Therefore I confess and acknowledge (but not from the bottom of my heart) that for the space of these 12 years I have been a most cruel murderer, not onely of Bodies, but of Souls; that I have perjur'd my self, First by my Oath of All giance, and secondly by my Solemn <HI>Covenant,</HI> wherein (as in <HI>Hos.</HI> 1.9,) I have spoken words, swearing falsly in making a Covenant; springeth up against me) like Hemlock in the furrows of the field: That I have most Trayterously betrayed, and murdered my lawful King, the Anointed of the Lord, that I have made Gods House and the Kings house a <HI>Den of Thieves:</HI> that I have loved wickedness, and practised it; that no fear hath dehorted me from doing any thing <HI>(but Justice)</HI> that I have robbed both God &amp; the King, and have not feared the one nor honored the other: that I have used all manner of jugglings, Cousenage, contradictions and Equivoca∣tions, that my Religion hath been Railing, Blasphemy; Treason and Tautalogies,</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
<P> And that I have not onely covered but by the instigation of the Devil, and against the Lawes of our Soveraign Lord King <HI>Charles,</HI> forceably taken, stole and carried away the goods and Chattells of many thousands of his Majesties Loyal and obedient Subjects; that I have made this <HI>Canaan</HI> of all happiness, a <HI>Golgotha,</HI> and Field of Blood; and have yoaked my fellow Subjects to the Pride, Tyranny and Op∣pression of my own Lust and Ambition; instead of Reforming I have deformed, instead of repairing I have pulled down; Which hath oc∣casioned all these miseries to fall upon me; My greatest grief of all be∣ing, that I know I have committed all this, and much more, but can∣not Repent for the same; therefore the several Independents, Ana∣baptists, Seekers, Ranters Quakers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> within the Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster,</HI> and the late Lines of Communications, are desired upon next <HI>Good Fryday</HI> if I shall not be Delivered before, to keep a day of feined Humiliation, and Prating; that the heavy judgements that so inevitably threaten me, may be diverted; That so I may come in again to Rule, Reign, and Tyrannize over you, Rump everlasting, Im∣positions, Assessments and Taxations without end.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>London.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Daughter I perceive by thy pulses beating, and so much blood springing out of thy Conscience into thy Face, that thou art almost already as it were dead, and its a question whether the Child thou now art in labour with, may come to perfection or no? or live to receive its Christendom, and though I have upheld thee in all thy Actions, and safely brought thee from <HI>Portsmouth</HI> to <HI>Westminster;</HI> and succoured the <HI>Fox</HI> 12. years with Plate, Bodkins, Rings and Bowls, yet thy sins and abominations have been so great I cannot deliver thee so as to restore thee to thy former power, I advise thee therefore re∣store what is taken by thy cruel Paws from thy God, thy King, thy Neighbour, and repent of thy perjury.</P>
<P>Whilst thus she speak the Room was fill'd with smoak, over spread clear with darkness, the Candles went out, and terrible thundrings were heard, intermixt with wawling of Catts, howling of Doggs, and barking of Wolves, which strnck a great terrour in all her Gossips; In the mean time Mrs. <HI>Rump</HI> brought forth an ugly deformed Monster without a head, goggle-ey'd, bloody hands, growing out on both sides of its de∣vouring
