<HEAD>THE COPIE OF A LETTER SENT FROM Mainhem the 20. of <HI>Iune</HI> 1622.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>IR, since my last, wee receiued a packet certifying; that about the fifteenth or sixeteenth of this month that before the Duke of <HI>Brunswicke</HI> could passe the riuer <HI>Maine,</HI> staying a day and a night after hee had built his bridge at the towne of <HI>Hoest</HI> two Dutch mile from <HI>Franckfort,</HI> hearing that <HI>Tilley</HI> with his army of 24000 was aduancing towards him, resolues to stay to giue him bartle, so loosing his opportunitie of passing the bridge with his whole army, at last perceiuing the greatnesse of <HI>Tilleys</HI> army, and by the perswasion of his Councell of warre, makes all the hast hee could to put ouer his army, all his foote being safely passed be∣ing about 10000. men, and his horse about 7000. a great part of them hauing past the bridge with all of his treasure, and some Canon; <HI>Tilley</HI> so speedily pur∣sues his rereward of horse, that he slue at least 1000. of his horse, tooke three Earles, the one of them called Count <HI>Leuistone,</HI> taking a great part of his baggage, and three peeces of Canon. And it is reported that a peece of Ordnance being discharged by <HI>Tilley,</HI> brake the bridge, which as was thought was the occasion that

<HEAD>A coppy of a trustfull Letter from Vienna the <HI>27.</HI> of May. <HI>1622.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Fauourable Lord and friend, the warres in the Em∣pire are made in the Empire with enough disorder, and it seemeth that the Duke of <HI>Bauaria</HI> doth but little preuaile with his forces; And <HI>Tilley</HI> impouerisheth the Country by the contributions: He fauours much the Bishop of <HI>Wirtsburgh,</HI> but it is to be feared that hee is not able to helpe his Lordship much in his preten∣sion.</P>
