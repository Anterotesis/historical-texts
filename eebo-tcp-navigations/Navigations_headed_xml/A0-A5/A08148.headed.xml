<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hat I have certified you, is not onely confirmed, but we have likewise received here further intelligence, that the Swedes are already in the midst of our King∣dom, and have anew totally routed and defeated the rest of Gen: <HI>Marazini's</HI> forces, and about 1000 of them slain, obtained 28 Standards, and taken prisoner Gen: <HI>Marazini</HI> himself, together with his wife and children, the yong Count of Shlick, and other Officers, which causeth great fear, not onely in this City, but even at Vienna: Gen: <HI>Hatzfeld</HI> is comming with his troops, to succour Gen: <HI>Gallas,</HI> but the Swedish Gen: Major <HI>King</HI> followeth him upon the foot; if this conjunction be hindred, our Kingdom will be in the highest danger; and it is to be feared, that we shall not be rid again so soon of these guests: Gen: <HI>Gallas,</HI> Fieldmarshall Baron of Hoffkirck, the old Count of Shlick, Count of Furstenburg, and Count of Colleredo, are here in this City very much perplex'd, and their forces intrench themselves upon the White-Hill:</P>

<P>The Hatzfeldish troops, which are arrived hereabouts, and lye at Furt, are to break up again to morrow, or next day after, with whom certain Bavarian troops are to joyn, and go together into Bohemia, they have very bad weather to march, and are likely to come too late: At this in∣stant we receive the Letters from Prague, it seemeth the poor people dare not write what they know, yet this they certifie, that the Swedes at their own pleasure straggle all the Country over, and play the master in the field; the Imperialists, except the Hatzfeldish succour, which con∣sists of brave horsmen, but the foot are not 1500 strong, and in all, both horse and foot, not above 5000; the Imperialists themselves begin al∣ready to pillage in the Cities of Prague; the passage towards Dresden and Silesia is stopp'd, and it seemeth that the War will be very hot this yeer in Bohemia and Silesia; if so be that Gen: <HI>Bannier</HI> gives one blow more to the Imperialists, he will go a great way: the Swedes go about to salute the Hatzfeldish troops, afore they come into Bohemia; many
<PB REF="2" MS="y"/>of the said Hatzfeldish troops run away, insomuch that not above 4000 men will come into Bohemia.</P>

<P>Within this hour, I am to go by Post from Prague, but with small courage, because the danger is too great; Gen: <HI>Bannier</HI> with his Army, is marching directly thitherwards; he hath now in his possession Leutma∣ritz, and hath surrounded Tabor, where is such flying towards Vienna, and from thence towards Gratz into Stiria, that it is not to be expressed; whole Bohemia will be lost within few daies: upon the White-Hill lye 10000 Imperialists to oppose the Swedes. The Imperial Court, together with the yong Prince, is going towards Gratz. At Vienna, all the names of the Townsmen are taken, he that doth not furnish his house with pro∣vision for 6 moneths must depart out of the City, insomuch that many are already going towards Hungaria.</P>
