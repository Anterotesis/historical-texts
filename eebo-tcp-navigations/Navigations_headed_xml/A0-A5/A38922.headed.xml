<HEAD>AN EXACT JOURNAL OF THE SIEGE OF Namur, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the better understanding the Motions of both Armies, so soon as they took the Field; of the <HI>Confederates</HI> striving to amuse the Enemy; and co∣ver their main Design; and of the <HI>French,</HI> deluded by those Amusements, and endeavouring to defend themselves from the feign'd Attempts of the <HI>Confede<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ates,</HI> 'tis necessary that we should make a Repetition of the Movements on both sides from the beginning of the Campagne; since they all tended to a Siege; of which Posterity, as well as the present Age, will be glad to have an Exact Account.</P>
<P>The Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shal <HI>de Villeroy</HI> was no sooner arriv'd in the <HI>French</HI> Army, but that he might win the Affection of so many great Officers, over whom he was to command, he told the chiefest among 'em, that he had in his Stables a
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>Hundred Horses, which they might make use of when they had occasion: That he would also keep Three. Ta∣bles, where they would do him a kindness to come and Eat, and that his Purse was still at their Service. After these Complements, the <HI>French</HI> General having visited all the Army that lay in different Quarters, from <HI>Furnes</HI> to the <HI>Meuse,</HI> caus'd those Troops that lay about <HI>Kièvraine,</HI> to pass the River <HI>Haisne,</HI> the 3d of <HI>June,</HI> in order to en∣camp at <HI>Blaton,</HI> Two Leagues from <HI>Condè.</HI> The 6th, a∣bout Four in the Afternoon, he order'd the whole Army to march, and take up their Post in the Camp at <HI>Leuse.</HI> The same Day also, M. <HI>de Bouflers</HI> encamp'd with his Army at <HI>Gosseliers,</HI> upon the <HI>Pieton,</HI> Two Leagues from <HI>Charleroy.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time, the King of <HI>England,</HI> who arriv'd at <HI>Gaunt,</HI> the 6th of <HI>June,</HI> departed the same day for the Ar∣my which lay at <HI>Aerseel,</HI> near <HI>Thielt,</HI> under the Command of the Prince of <HI>Vaudemont,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Wirtembergh.</HI> The next day his Majesty visited all the Posts round about the Camp.</P>
<P>The Marshal <HI>de Villeroy</HI> being inform'd of the King's Ar∣rival in the Army, upon the 8th, by Five in the Morning, Decamp'd from <HI>Leuse,</HI> and marching all that Day and the next, upon the 10th encamp'd at <HI>Cordes</HI> between <HI>Tour∣nay</HI> and <HI>Oudenard.</HI> The same day he visited the Lines, between the <HI>Lys</HI> and the <HI>Scheld,</HI> and between <HI>Ypres</HI> and the <HI>Lys,</HI> and order'd the raising of some new Bastions from <HI>Ypres</HI> to <HI>Commines,</HI> and to furnish 'em sufficiently with great Guns.</P>
<P>Upon the 10th. the King took a review of the Horse, and upon the 11th, detach'd away Twelve Squadrons, un∣der the Marquess <HI>de la Foret,</HI> Lieutenant General, who pass'd the <HI>Lys</HI> at <HI>Machelen,</HI> over Three Bridges, with Orders to joyn the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> who lay encamp'd with his Army at <HI>Ninove.</HI> The same day also the King decamp'd, and to the End he might draw nearer to the Lines, encamp'd at <HI>Rousselare,</HI> over against <HI>Commines</HI> and <HI>Ypres,</HI> and advanc'd the 13th to <HI>Bekelar,</HI> a League or there∣about
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>from the Enemies Lines. Now in regard this Move∣ment threatned the very Center of 'em, as well as <HI>Menin, Ypres, la Kenoque, Furnes,</HI> the Canal <HI>d' Eauve</HI> and <HI>Boasingue: Villeroy</HI> seem'd to be at a great puzzle, not knowing well what effectual Course to take for the Preservation of so many Places at a time. Thereupon he forthwith issued out several Orders; he caus'd great Numbers of Men to march several ways, under several Commanders, and chang'd the Posts of several. M. <HI>de Rosen,</HI> who lay at <HI>Eschem,</HI> to defend the Line from <HI>Courtrai</HI> to the <HI>Scheld,</HI> pass'd to <HI>Ypres</HI> to defend the whole on that side, M. <HI>de Mon∣trevel,</HI> was sent to <HI>Eschem,</HI> in the Place of M. <HI>de Rosen.</HI> M. <HI>de Capestan</HI> was appointed to command at <HI>Kenoke;</HI> the Count <HI>de la Motte,</HI> to command at <HI>Ypres,</HI> and M. <HI>de Pra∣contal</HI> at <HI>Comines.</HI> M. <HI>de Caraman</HI> commanded to <HI>Ypres,</HI> and M. <HI>Davejan</HI> to <HI>Courtray,</HI> and M. <HI>de Montal</HI> lay next to <HI>Dunkirk.</HI> The Marshal also order'd several Pieces of Ca∣non to be planted upon the Rising Grounds of <HI>Hollebeck,</HI> where he had rais'd new Works, as having observ'd that part to be weaker than any of the rest.</P>
<P>During these Motions, the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> who lay encamp'd at <HI>Ninove,</HI> departed from thence the 14th, pass'd the <HI>Dendre,</HI> and encamp'd at St. <HI>Stephens.</HI> The 15th he ar∣riv'd at <HI>Ename</HI> upon the <HI>Scheldt,</HI> a League below <HI>Oudenarde;</HI> and the 17th encampt at <HI>Castre,</HI> within half a League of the Enemies new Line. On the other side, the Marshal <HI>de Bouflers</HI> who lay with the Body of an Army at St. <HI>Gui∣lain,</HI> to observe the Electors Motions, being inform'd of these Movements, departed the 15th, and encamp'd near <HI>Tournai.</HI> The 16th he drew near the <HI>Scheld,</HI> and the 17th encamp'd under the Lines of <HI>Courtrai,</HI> where he receiv'd a Reinforcement of Horse and Foot, that <HI>Villeroy</HI> sent him.</P>
<P>At the same time that the Elector encamp'd at <HI>Ninove,</HI> the Count of <HI>Athlone</HI> was detach'd from his Army, with Two and Twenty Squadrons of Horse, and Nine of <HI>Dutch</HI> Dragoons, and some <HI>Bavarian</HI> Troops, to march toward <HI>Louvain,</HI> and joyn, if it were necessary, with the Troops
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> and <HI>Liege,</HI> that lay quarter'd at <HI>Hologne,</HI> about a League from that City, and where they were joyn'd with the Brigadier <HI>Damprè,</HI> with Four Regiments of <HI>Dutch</HI> Horse; and from whence they decamp'd the 18th, in order to march to <HI>Mehaigne.</HI> All which time, the Count <HI>de Harcourt</HI> lay with a Volant Camp of <HI>French</HI> Horse in the <HI>Condros,</HI> to observe the Confederates on this side.</P>
<P>Marshal <HI>de Villeroy</HI> being inform'd, that the King of <HI>England</HI> drew near the Lines between <HI>Ypres</HI> and <HI>Warneton,</HI> decamp'd from <HI>Cordes,</HI> and march'd all Night of the 13th and 14th. The Foot being led by the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> and the Horse by the Duke of <HI>Bourbon;</HI> and the whole Army encamp'd at <HI>Houthem</HI> in Two-Lines, the first all of Infantry, the Second all of Cavalry.</P>
<P>Till the 19th, the <HI>French</HI> wrought hard to secure their Works rais'd all along the Lines; they also press'd forward the finishing of the New Works, and distributed Ammu∣nition among the Soldiers. All the care of the <HI>French</HI> having been by these Motions, to retrench the more safely, and so to order it, that they might not be constrained to come to a Fight; a Proof sufficient that the <HI>Confederates</HI> were Superior to 'em in Number.</P>
<P>Upon the 17th, the King detach'd away the Duke of <HI>Wirtembergh,</HI> with 3000 Men, and some Artillery, with Orders to advance toward <HI>Kenoque,</HI> to the end he might draw the Enemy that way, and make 'em believe that there was a real Design upon that Fort: But before they could get thither, there was a Post that stood in their way, about half a League from the Fort, of which it behov'd 'em to make themselves Masters. This Post was defended by above 400 Dragoons, who were attacqu'd with such an undaunted Bravery, as surpriz'd the Enemy themselves. M. <HI>de la Motte,</HI> who commanded on that side, sent a Reinforcement to his own, so that there was brisk Firing on both sides: But at length the <HI>French</HI> were forc'd to give way, and the Assailants made themselves Masters both of the Post, and the Mote on that side: They also lodg'd themselves there, and made a Battery of Two Pieces of
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>Canon in the same Place. It was the common Opinion, that in this Action, the Duke of <HI>Wirtemberg</HI> lost about Two Hundred, and the Enemy near Four Hundred Men.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Count <HI>de la Motte</HI> caus'd another Battery to be rais'd in Opposition to that which the <HI>Con∣federates</HI> had erected, and they began to play one upon ano∣ther with great Fury. The <HI>French</HI> also made all the haste they could to entrench themselves beyond the <HI>Yser,</HI> casting up the Earth before the River, because the Moat which they possessed, lay lower than that which was opposite to it, the Ground being Marshy. They were also Masters of part of another Moat, which lay under the Canon of <HI>la Kenoque:</HI> And they shelter'd themselves besides, by means of a Parapet which they rais'd all the length of the Ground which look'd toward the <HI>Consederates,</HI> and which they cut in two or Three Places, to render the Access more diffi∣cult.</P>
<P>Upon the 20th in the Afternoon, the Duke of <HI>Wirtem∣berg</HI> being strengthned with some new Reinforcements, <HI>Villeroy</HI> who had notice of it, sent away from the Left Wing of his Army, Eight Battalions, and a Brigade of Horse, under the Marquis of <HI>Feuquieres,</HI> Lieutenant General. The Night of the 20th to the 21st, was spent in continual Skirmishes; and there was a Report spread Abroad, that <HI>la Kenoque</HI> was assayl'd in Military Forms: But that was almost im∣possible, and it was sufficiently apparent, that the Assaylants had no design to do it; but only to draw down all the strength of the Enemy to that side of <HI>Flanders,</HI> by feigning the Seige of <HI>la Kenoque,</HI> and thereby cause the <HI>French</HI> to run at the wrong Deer. For it was a most difficult Task to pass the <HI>Yser,</HI> by reason of the Works which the <HI>French</HI> had cast up; and there was no attacquing the Fort, without passing that River: And though the Confederates had pass'd it, there lay beyond the broken Bridge, a great Quagmire, with a Road about Thirty Foot broad, wherein the <HI>French</HI> had made several Entrenchments one behind another. Be∣sides, <HI>Montal</HI> commanded with his Volant Camp, from
<PB N="6" REF="6"/><HI>Dunkirk</HI> to <HI>Fintelle:</HI> His Forces stretching themselves from <HI>Furnes</HI> to this Place, which is a Considerable Post, well fur∣nish'd with Men, because that they who would pass the <HI>Yser</HI> must take it before they can come at <HI>Furnes.</HI></P>
<P>While these things were thus Acting on this side, the Elector of <HI>Bevaria</HI> lay not Idle. Upon the 17th of <HI>June</HI> the Horse and Foot had orders to prepare Facines or Faggots to be lay'd before the Regiments. The 19th the E∣lector riding with between three and four thousand Horse to View the Ground about the <HI>Lines,</HI> found that the <HI>French</HI> had posted themselves at the Mill of <HI>Belleghem,</HI> which is not above half a Quarter of a League from Fort <HI>de Clar,</HI> and the Lines. In this Place were posted five hundred Foot, and eight or ten Squardrons. Therefore M. General <HI>Fagel</HI> was sent away with some Troops to make himself Master of the Post. The Onset was Rude and Obstinate, for they charg'd and return'd to the Charge several times. But the <HI>French</HI> were constrain'd to give way, and retreated into their Lines the best they could, and in great disorder, being closely pursu'd by the Confederates. The <HI>Mill</HI> be∣ing thus taken, the Victors entrench'd themselves upon the Place, and maintain'd their ground.</P>
<P>By this time some part of <HI>June</HI> being spent in all these Attacks, and having sufficiently fatigu'd and remov'd the Enemy at a distance from the Place where the Attaque was really design'd, private Orders were given to the <HI>Branden∣burghers,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Athlone,</HI> to the Army of the Elector of <HI>Ba∣varia</HI> and the King of <HI>Englands</HI> Forces, to set forward in Or∣der to put in Execution the Design which had been lay'd some time before. For all this while the Confederates, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> order to what they cheifly propos'd to themselves, had made great Preparations at <HI>Leige</HI> of Great Guns, Ammunition and Provision, Pickaxes, Spades, Shovels and other Uten∣sils for Seiges, which were conveigh'd by Water down the River <HI>Meuse.</HI> They had got together a great Body of Men compos'd of the Troops of <HI>Munster, Cologn, Leige, Bran∣denburghers</HI> and others, who were advanc'd as far as <HI>Falaise,</HI> upon the <HI>Mehaigne.</HI> These were all order'd to march
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>directly for <HI>Namur;</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Athlone</HI> decamp'd from <HI>Bethlem</HI>'s, tending his march to the same Place. He en∣camp'd at <HI>Roesbeck</HI> the 22d where he made a Halt one day; then marching three days together, and crossing the Famous Plain of <HI>Fleurus,</HI> he encamp'd the 29th at <HI>Mellé,</HI> within an hour and a half's march of <HI>Charleroi</HI> While the <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> got before and advanc'd still nearer to the <HI>Samber:</HI> And upon the 2d of <HI>July,</HI> he cross'd the <HI>Sam∣ber</HI> and invested <HI>Namur</HI> on that side next <HI>Condros.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> decamp'd from <HI>Castre,</HI> about the 28th at night, and came the next morning to St. <HI>Lievens Hauten,</HI> and the 30th encamp'd at <HI>Ninove.</HI> The 1st of <HI>July</HI> he came to <HI>Hall,</HI> and the next day to <HI>Masy,</HI> within two leagues of <HI>Namur.</HI> The 3d he made his Approaches nearer to the City, cross'd the <HI>Samber,</HI> po∣sted his Men and took up his Head Quarters in the <HI>Abby de Maloigne.</HI> The Baron of <HI>Heiden,</HI> General of the <HI>Branden∣burghers,</HI> who had pass'd the <HI>Samber</HI> below <HI>Charleroi,</HI> took his Post next to <HI>Morlaigne,</HI> and sent a Detachment over the <HI>Meuse</HI> on that side next to <HI>Condros.</HI> While the Earl of <HI>Athlone</HI> posted himself on this side the <HI>Meuse</HI> with his Caval∣ry: And thus <HI>Namur,</HI> upon the 3d of <HI>June,</HI> was invested on every side.</P>
<P>His Majesty of Great <HI>Britain</HI> upon the 27th of <HI>June</HI> sent away the heavy Baggage, the Suttlers and the Artillery from the Camp at <HI>Bekelaer:</HI> And the 28th by five a clock in the morning the whole Army decamp'd in two Colums, and marching on both sides of the Road with the Artillery encamp'd at <HI>Rousselaer.</HI> In the mean time the Duke of <HI>Wirtemberg</HI> having demolish'd the Post which he had made himself Master off, retreated to <HI>Dixmude</HI> with the Bo∣dy under his command.</P>
<P>The 29th his Majesty having left the Army to the Conduct of the Prince of <HI>Vaudemont,</HI> departed with a De∣tachment of Granadiers and the Guards of his Body, and took the Road of <HI>Vilvorde.</HI> However ten thousand Men of that Army had orders to march to <HI>Brussels</HI> through <HI>Deinse, Gaure,</HI> and <HI>Alost.</HI></P>
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
<P>His Majesty lay the 30th at <HI>Grimbery,</HI> and the 1st of <HI>July</HI> at the Abby of <HI>Parc</HI> near <HI>Lovain.</HI> The 2d he ar∣rived near <HI>Namur</HI> about a eleven a clock in the forenoon, and took up his Head Quarters at <HI>Coutoix le Chasteau.</HI> He held a Council of War that Evening, and the next Morn∣ing the Army drew nearer the City. The 3d his Majesty took up his Quarters at <HI>Flawen,</HI> on this side the <HI>Samber.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Villeroy</HI> observing these unexpected Movements, sent away several Detachments to joyn <HI>Bouflers.</HI> But the Prince of <HI>Vau∣demont</HI> who watches the <HI>French</HI> General, sent away as many Detachments from his Army, as the Marshal detach'd from his, and Encampt at <HI>Gramme</HI> near <HI>Deinse.</HI></P>
<P>The 4th in the Evening the Beseigers began to fall brisk∣ly to work in drawing and making their Lines of Circum-Vallation, and Contra-Vallation; but notwithstanding all their diligence they could not prevent <HI>Bouflers</HI> from getting into the Town with several Regiments of Dragoons, and M. <HI>Meg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igni</HI> the Chiefest Engineer in <HI>France,</HI> next to M. <HI>Vauban.</HI> So that there was then said to be in the Town and Cittadel, besides those Seven Regiments, one and twenty Battalions, a Regiment of Cavalry, several Great Officers, a Company of Frank Volunteers, a Company of Canoneers, another of Miners, a Brigade of Engineers, and Ammunition and Provisions for six Months. By the 12th the Lines being finish'd, and some Batteries to cover the Workmen and Pioneers, the same evening the Trenches were open'd in three several Places; and the Beseigers play'd from one Battery while the Workmen labour'd without ceas∣ing to bring the rest to perfection: During which time the Beseiged made three Sallies, but in every one had no Suc∣cess, being still repuls'd with loss: Tho' Mr. General <HI>Fa∣gel</HI> was wounded in one of 'em, and the Baron of <HI>Plettem∣berg,</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Munster</HI>'s Nephew, and a very good Officer, Slain with a Cannon Bullet.</P>
<P>On the 8th of <HI>July</HI> N. S. Twenty Battalions of Foot, of which Thirteen were <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Scotch,</HI> being sent from the Prince of <HI>Vaudemont</HI>'s Army joyn'd the Beseigers, un∣der the Command of the Count of <HI>Nassau,</HI> Lieutenant
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>General, and M. General <HI>Ramsey;</HI> and upon the 10th, Four <HI>English,</HI> and Two Battalions of <HI>Dutch,</HI> under the lead∣ing of the Lord <HI>Cutts,</HI> arriv'd in the Camp; so that the Besiegers were then no less 90 Battalions of Infantry. The Artillery also consisted of 120 Great Guns, and 60 Mor∣tars.</P>
<P>Upon the 12th of <HI>July,</HI> Major General <HI>Salish</HI> relieved the Trenches; the next day, Major General <HI>Lindeboome,</HI> and upon the 14th, Major General <HI>Henkelem.</HI> During which time, the Besiegers Works and Approaches being carried on within Pistol-shot of the Enemies Out-works upon the Hill near <HI>Brussels</HI> Gate, his Majesty resolv'd to storm those Works. To which purpose, all things being in a rea∣diness, the Attack was begun on <HI>Monday</HI> the 15th, about Six a Clock in the Afternoon, upon the Right Hand, by Five Battalions of the Foot-Guards, commanded by Major General <HI>Ramsey,</HI> seconded by Nine Battalions more of <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Scotch:</HI> Upon the Left, Eight <HI>Dutch,</HI> and other Regiments under the Command of Major General <HI>Salish,</HI> were order'd to undertake the Assault. This Attack was performed with a more than ordinary Courage, and a Suc∣cess answerable. For after a very sharp and obstinate Dis∣pute, that held near upon Two Hours, the Besieged were beaten out of their Forts upon the Hill, and a Great En∣trenchment that leads to the Town, of which the Victors possessed themselves, being the most considerable Outworks which the Besiegers had on this side.</P>
<P>In this Attack, the Besiegers had in all about 300 Men slain out-right, and 400 Wounded. Of the <HI>English</HI> Guards, Lieutenant Collonel <HI>Robinson,</HI> Five Lieutenants, and Two Ensigns were slain; Colonel <HI>Matthews,</HI> and several others were wounded. Of the <HI>French</HI> side; M. <HI>Moulevier,</HI> and M. <HI>de Vitry</HI> who acted as Brigadiers, and the Count of <HI>Mor∣stein,</HI> Son in Law to the Duke of <HI>Chevreuse,</HI> with about 50 Commanders more of Note kill'd, besides Inferior Of∣ficers, and about 1600 Men Kill'd and Wounded,</P>
<P>The same day, about Two Hours before this desperate Attack, the Besieged made a Sally upon the <HI>Brandenburghers</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>Quarter, but after a sharp Conflict, were beaten back, and pursu'd to the very Gates of the Fort near the <HI>Meuse.</HI> The Ene∣mies loss could not choose but be very considerable, on the other side the <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> lost a Collonel, and some o∣ther Officers kill'd, and had about a Hundred Men kill'd and wounded.</P>
<P>On the <HI>Tuesday</HI> Night following, Major General <HI>Heuke∣lom</HI> reliev'd the Trenches; the next Night, Major Ge∣neral <HI>Salish,</HI> and on <HI>Thursday</HI> Night, Major General <HI>Ramsey.</HI> And at the same time, they had several Bat∣teries playing against the detach'd Bastions, that were be∣tween <HI>Brussels</HI> and St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> Gate, toward which they were making their Approaches with all the speed they could.</P>
<P>While things were thus hotly disputed between the Besiegers and the Besieged at <HI>Namur,</HI> Marshal <HI>de Villeroy</HI> well understand∣ing that the Army under the Command of the Prince of <HI>Vau∣demont</HI> was very much weaken'd by the sending of several Detachments to the Siege and other Places, thought he bad now an Opportunity to do a considerable piece of Service for his Master, by cutting off so considerable a part of the Con∣federate Forces: To which purpose he drain'd all the <HI>French</HI> Garrisons round about, and having by that means drawn together a Force that was almost treble in Number to the Prince of <HI>Vaudemont,</HI> he set forward with a full Resolution to fall upon him in his Trenches, in Front, Flank and Rear; confident he had him in such a Snare, that 'twas im∣possible a Man should escape him.</P>
<P>'Twas upon the 10th of <HI>July</HI> therefore, that the <HI>French</HI> Army under <HI>Villeroy</HI> decamp'd from <HI>Pont Escanaffe,</HI> and quitted their Lines to attack the Prince, who lay near <HI>Deinse.</HI> Now in regard that the Confederates were so en∣camp'd, that the Enemy would have had 'em in Flank, the Prince thought it convenient to alter the Array of his Ar∣my, and to post his Right Wing beyond <HI>Aerseele,</HI> whereas it was posted at <HI>Dendergem;</HI> and the Left Wing he posted all along the <HI>Lys,</HI> a little above <HI>Gramme,</HI> whereas before it was posted at <HI>Zeveren,</HI> near <HI>Deinse.</HI> About Eight a Clock
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>in the Evening, some Squadrons of the Enemies, advanced as far as <HI>Dendergem,</HI> and began to charge the Prince's Ad∣vanc'd Guards, who retreated between <HI>Dendergem,</HI> and the Front of the Army, according to the Orders they had re∣ceived.</P>
<P>The Night following, the Prince order'd a Line to be cast up, to cover his Left Wing and Main Body, and order'd several Pieces of Canon to be planted in the prin∣cipal Avenues to the Camp. The 14th, between Seven and Eight in the Morning, it was easily perceiv'd, that the E∣nemies Army began to reach <HI>Denderghem,</HI> making a shew as if they intended to side off to the Princes Left Wing. In the mean time the Right Wing was surrounded with a Line, as the Left and the Main Body had been environ'd before: But the Enemy made a Halt near <HI>Denderghem,</HI> till about Noon, when their whole Army fil'd along the High-way of <HI>Thielt,</HI> and came to post themselves within Canon shot of the Prince's Right Wing: And then it was, that the Prince expected a General Assault. But they durst not venture to attacque him, seeing him so well en∣trench'd, and in so very good Order to receive them, the Great Guns being extreamly well dispos'd for that pur∣pose.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Prince having Advice, that the Count of <HI>Montal</HI> was filing along his Right Wing, with a great Body of Horse and Foot, in order to charge 'em in the Rear, and the Marshal to attacque him in the Front, for that their Forces were much more numerous than His, the Prince immediately caus'd all the Baggage to pass the <HI>Scheld</HI> at <HI>Deinse,</HI> from thence to be Convoy'd to <HI>Gaunt,</HI> which was done. Afterwards, he drew off his Artillery from the Batteries, and order'd them to take the same Road; as also the Ammunition Waggons, and the Infan∣try, in several little Bodies.</P>
<P>And the better to hinder the Enemy from perceiving his Retreat, the Prince order'd <HI>M. d' Overkirk</HI> to face the Enemy, with all the Horse and Dragoons of the Right
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>Wing, and for that purpose to range himself in Battel Array, from <HI>Aerseel</HI> to <HI>Vink,</HI> which was done; and after the Artillery, Baggage, Ammunition-Waggons and Foot were got far enough before, M. <HI>de Overkirk</HI> follow'd with the Cavalry and Dragoons, as the Prince had order'd him.</P>
<P>Thus was the Enemy amus'd, notwithstanding they lay so very near, and that the Prince did not begin to march till about Five or Six of the Clock in the Afternoon, and consequently in open Day-light. And this March was per∣form'd in so good Order and with so much Speed, that the Enemy durst not attack the <HI>Consederates.</HI> Nor had they lost one Man, but for a Stratagem which the <HI>French</HI> us'd, which was by making use of Green Colours, to intermix with some of the Rear guard, and to fall upon Two Bat∣talions, and some Granadeers, before they could get in∣to a Lane through which they were to pass. But the Granadeers, and another Battalion making a Halt, the Enemy was soon repulsed: However this Stratagem cost the <HI>Confederates</HI> 200 Men. The Marshal enrag'd that such an Opportunity had slipt out of his Hands, Burnt and Plunder'd the Village of <HI>Wootergen,</HI> where the Prince had his Head Quarters.</P>
<P>When his Majesty of <HI>Great Britain</HI> was inform'd that the Army and the Prince were safe, and what a Brave and Masterlike Retreat he had made, he sent the Prince the ensuing Letter.</P>

<P>YOƲ may well imagin how uneasie I was upon the Receipt of your last Letter, dated Yesterday Noon, which came to me this Morning by break of Day; and how great a Joy your other Letter was to me, Dated from <HI>Marykerk,</HI> near <HI>Gaunt,</HI> this Day at Three of the Clock in the Morning, finding that you under∣stood so well with so much prudence, and so gloriously to disingage your self from so imminent a Danger. I am much oblig'd to you for it; for in this Retreat you have given greater Marks of a general accomplishment in the Art of War, than if you had won a Battel. I absolutely approve your Conduct upon this occasion, and I hope it will caution the Enemy from attempting any more of the same Nature. In the mean time, I impa∣tiently expect to hear which way they will bend their March, now they have miss'd their Blow. I remain always, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<PB N="14" REF="10"/>
<P>But to return to the Siege; after the Attack on <HI>Monday</HI> was over, a Letter was intercepted from M. <HI>Bouflers</HI> to the King of <HI>France,</HI> wherein, after the Marshal had given him a Relation of the particulars of the Attack, he very much lamented, that it had cost his Majesty above a Thousand Men, among which he reckon'd the Counts of <HI>Maulevrier</HI> and <HI>Morstein,</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Monbron,</HI> the Governor of <HI>Cambray</HI>'s Son, Colonel of the Dauphin's Regiment, Two other Colonels, 16 Captains, and several good Officers and Persons of Note. It was a Woman who undertook to carry the Letter to <HI>Dinant,</HI> from thence to be sent to the Court; but instead of the Recompence which M. <HI>Bou∣flers</HI> put her in hopes of receiving for her pains, the Be∣siegers hang'd her up upon a Gibbet, that she might serve for an Example to others, who should undertake such kind of Messages.</P>
<P>On the 18th of <HI>July,</HI> Orders were given out for Major General <HI>Ramsey,</HI> with Five Battalions of Guards, to Storm an Old Tower that stands below a certain Place call'd <HI>la Bouge,</HI> and the Enemies Works descending toward the Counterscarp; the order of which Attack was thus. The First Battalion of the First Regiment of Guards, a Bat∣talion of <HI>Coldstreamers</HI> Regiment of Guards, and a Battalion of <HI>Scotch</HI> Guards, were order'd for the Attack upon the Right Hand, toward the bottom. The Second Battalion of the first Regiment of Guards, was appointed for the At∣tack on the Left Hand, by the Old Tower. At the Head of these Attacks, march'd a Hundred and Twenty Fuse∣liers, who carried Fascines before them; and the same number of Granadiers, follow'd by a Hundred Pioneers with Spades, Shovels and Gabions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> On the Right of the Body which advanced on the Right Hand, march'd a Hundred Granadiers, carrying Fascines before them, fol∣low'd by Fifty Pioneers; and the same Number of Grana∣diers was on the Right of the Body on the Left Hand, be∣tween the Two Attacks.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="10"/>
<P>Half an Hour after Six a Clock in the Afternoon, the Signal was given, at what time the Battalions before men∣tion'd march'd forward in the appointed Order, with that undaunted Courage and Bravery, which is not to be ex∣press'd, never taking any notice of the Enemies Firing, which was very thick and furious: For the Fuseliers that were in the Front, advanc'd with their Fascines to the very Palisado's, where when they had laid 'em down, they fell a Firing upon the Enemy, while the Granadiers ply'd the Tower and Works, the Battalions in the mean time march∣ing close after 'em, with their Muskets shoulder'd, till they came so very near, that they presented over the Palisados, driving the Defendants from thence, and pursuing them through a wide Place of Arms, to the bottom of the Work.</P>
<P>But the Enemy firing a-fresh from the Counterscarp, and a Redoubt that lay on the other side of a Hollow way, upon the Assailant's Flank, the Lord <HI>Cuts</HI> immediately hasten'd to second those that were engag'd, with Three Bat∣talions of <HI>Titcomb, Stanley</HI> and <HI>Collingwood;</HI> with the First of which, he flew to the lowest Palisados, and together with the Guards, a Second time beat back the Enemy, some into the Water, others where they could best shift for themselves.</P>
<P>At the same time Brigadier <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> with the Lord <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s, his own Regiment of Fuseliers, <HI>Ingolsby, Saun∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rson, Lowder</HI> and <HI>Maitland,</HI> set forward toward the At∣tacks, with the Two First to relieve the <HI>Dutch</HI> Guards, and those that were with the Lord <HI>Cutts,</HI> at the lowest Palisa∣do's; the rest were drawn up by the Tower, to give assi∣stance as occasion requir'd; only <HI>Lowders</HI> Regiment was posted on the other side of the Hollow way, to prevent Flanking and Surprize. In the mean time, Major General <HI>Ramsey</HI> commanded the Pike-men to carry Fascines, and raise a work sufficient to withstand a Musket Shot; and when he had posted in that Place, the Regiments of <HI>In∣golsby, Sanderson, Lowder</HI> and <HI>Maitland,</HI> he drew off the rest by break of Day, to the First Parade. The Fury
<PB N="16" REF="11"/>and Heat of this Action lasted about Two Hours, in which time the Besiegers possessed themselves of the Enemies Works, notwithstanding they were defended by such con∣siderable Numbers of Resolute Men. In this Bloody Action, the Assailants both Officers and Soldiers, signa∣liz'd themselves to that degree, that 'twas no wonder that they who did more than Men could be thought to do, should be superior and victorious over those who did no more than only what Men could do.</P>
<P>The chief Officers Slain and Wounded, were Colonel <HI>Robinson</HI> Kill'd, Lieutenant Colonel <HI>How,</HI> and Lieutenant Colonel <HI>Davis</HI> Wounded, of the First Regiment of Guards. In the <HI>Coldstream</HI> Guards, Colonel <HI>Matthews,</HI> Lieutenant Colonel <HI>Edgeworth,</HI> and Leiutenant Colonel <HI>Jones</HI> Wound∣ed, <HI>Pierce</HI> and <HI>Morison,</HI> Lieutenant Collonels taken Priso∣ners. Of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Guards, Lieutenant Colonel <HI>John Ha∣milton</HI> wounded. Of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Guards, <HI>Goudaker</HI> and <HI>Pa∣nute,</HI> Lieutenant Colonels, and Major <HI>Hetzler</HI> wounded. Of the Royal Regiment, Major <HI>Mac Ilvain</HI> Slain, and the Lord <HI>George Hamilton</HI> Wounded. Of Colonel <HI>Ingolsby</HI>'s Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel <HI>Sabin</HI> Wounded, besides several Captains, Lieutenants and Ensigns, and others Kill'd and Wounded; and the whole Loss of Private Soldiers, accor∣ding to the Account given in by the several Colonels, was 308 Slain, and 604 Wounded. And as for the Enemy, they had no less than 1600 Kill'd and Wounded, by the Information of the Deserters.</P>
<P>In this Interim, <HI>Villeroy</HI> had laid a Design to have sur∣priz'd <HI>Nieuport,</HI> by means of a Correspondence which he held with a Person who had undertaken to deliver the Sluces into his Hands. But the Prince of <HI>Vaudemont</HI> having an inkling of it, sent immediate Orders to Lieutenant Ge∣neral <HI>Bellasis,</HI> (whom he had detach'd some Days before toward <HI>Bruges,</HI> with Twelve Battalions) to march with all speed toward the Canal, and dispute the Passage with the Enemy, which he did the next Night. The <HI>French</HI> know∣ing nothing of this, continu'd their March toward the Ca∣nal, but seeing Twelve Battalions posted on the other side,
<PB N="17" REF="11"/>they were so astonished, that they desisted from their De∣sign, and retreated faster than they came, fearing to be swallow'd up by the Waters of the Sluces which the Go∣vernor had open'd upon their Approach. And as for the Traytor, finding himself disappointed, he made his Escape to <HI>Furnes.</HI></P>
<P>The 25th at Night, the Besiegers posted themselves at the Foot of the Redoubt of <HI>Pallart,</HI> and about Mid∣night, set their Miners to work: Which enforc'd the Ene∣my that defended it, to surrender at discretion by break of Day, being in all Six and Fifty Men, among whom were a Captain, an Engineer, Two Lieutenants, and an En∣sign.</P>
<P>Upon the 27th of <HI>July</HI> in the Morning, his Majesty ha∣ving resolv'd that an Attack should be made upon the First Counterscarp of the Town, came into the Trenches him∣self, and after he had given ample and requisite Orders, more particularly, that all the Batteries as well of the Great Guns as Mortars, should play without intermission upon the Faces of the Bastion, before St. <HI>Nicholas</HI>'s Gate, and the front of the Counterguard that lay upon the Left Hand of the Ravelin near the <HI>Meuse,</HI> return'd to his Quar∣ters. In the Afternoon, he went again into the Trenches, and about Five a Clock in the Afternoon, the Attack be∣gan. The <HI>English</HI> march'd from the Head of the Trenches on the Right Hand, and advanc'd to the first Counterscarp that covers the Sluces. All the while the Enemy fir'd thick and furiously, and sprang Three or Four small Mines fill'd with Bombs upon the Glacis; nevertheless the As∣sailants made themselves Masters of the Counterscarp, and while they drave the Enemy from their Defences, the Be∣siegers made a Lodgment behind 'em upon the Glacis of the Counterscarp before mention'd.</P>
<P>At the same time the <HI>Dutch</HI> march'd upon the Left Hand, and advancing along the <HI>Meuse,</HI> fell upon the Ene∣my, who defended the First and Second Counterscarp in Flank, and in less than a Quarter of an Hour drove the Besieged out of the first Counterscarp, from one end to the
<PB N="18" REF="12"/>other. Which done, the Assailants presently began to lodge themselves with Wool-sacks, Gabions and Fascines, some of which unfortunately taking Fire, burnt a part of the Lodgment, made by the <HI>English</HI> to secure their Left against the Counterguard of St. <HI>Rocque</HI>'s Bastion. However the <HI>English,</HI> defenceless as they were, maintain'd their Ground, and kept the Enemy that were posted within the said Coun∣terguard in play, till they had made a new Lodgment be∣hind the First, which was at length put out. In the mean time the <HI>Dutch</HI> perceiving that the Enemies firing from the Counterguard, very much gall'd the <HI>English,</HI> mounted the Breach of the Counterscarp next the <HI>Meuse,</HI> plying the and Enemy with their Granado's, lodg'd themselves upon the Breach of the Counterscarp, as the <HI>English</HI> had done on the Counterscarp it self; by which means, they kept all the first Counterscarp, from the <HI>Meuse</HI> to the Inundation. The Enemy all this while kept firing continually with Five or Six Pieces of Canon, several of the Bullets of which flew near the Place where the King stood; and one of 'em kill'd Mr. <HI>Godfrey,</HI> and took off the Arm of Lieutenant Collonel <HI>d' Eck.</HI> Of the Besiegers, between Three and Four Hundred Men were Kill'd and Wounded in this Action. Nor could the Enemies Loss but be considerable, in regard that few of their Men who were posted in the first Coun∣terscarp, escap'd with their Lives; as also, for that the As∣sailants Canon and Bombs, and the small shot of their In∣fantry did great Execution.</P>
<P>At the same time, the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> attack'd, and made himself Master of an Advanc'd Post of the Enemies, between the <HI>Sambre</HI> and the Castle-Hill, wherein were lodg'd about Four Hundred Men, besides a Detachment to guard the Abby of <HI>Salsine,</HI> and another House that stood near it, Places both very proper for laying a Bridge over the <HI>Sambre,</HI> and to facilitate the Attack of the Castle. Du∣ring this Action, the Besieged Sally'd out of the Castle, both Horse and Dragoons, to second their Men, but upon the Electors sending some Squadrons against 'em, they presently retreated.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="12"/>
<P>After these Two Attacks were over, his Majesty order'd the Ditch of the Town to be drain'd; to which purpose, the Dam that kept in the Water, was undermin'd and blown up.</P>
<P>Upon the 29th of <HI>July,</HI> it was resolved that the Electors Men, should the next Morning early, attack the Enemies Lines, and Retrenchments that secur'd all their New Works before the Castle, between the <HI>Sambre</HI> and the <HI>Meuse:</HI> And the Forces appointed for this piece of Service, consisting of <HI>Bavarians, Brandenburghers,</HI> and other Foreign Troops, were order'd to move soon after it was dark, and during the Obscurity of the Night, to advance so near the Ene∣mies Trenches as possibly they could, without being dis∣cover'd.</P>
<P>Upon the 30th, as soon as Day was broke, the Signals being given, the Assaylants fell on in Three several Places. The Assent of the Hill proved somewhat difficult, besides that the Enemy had Eight or Nine Great Guns, conve∣niently planted at some distance without their Works, ad∣ditional to those mounted upon their Fortification. But notwithstanding all this, the Besieged were soon driven from their Lines, and that with so little Loss on the Assailants side, that had they stop'd according to their Orders, there would have hardly been Twenty lost. But the Granadiers in heat of Courage, pursuing the Fugitive Enemy, ad∣vanc'd so far, that they drove 'em from the Counterscarp of some of their strongest and most regular Works; but not being provided to lodge themselves, they were con∣strained to retire to the Ground where they were first com∣manded to post themselves, which was a good way within those Lines, which were by the Enemy thought so strong, as well by reason of their Scituation, as of the New Works which they had added since the Siege, that the Pur∣chase of 'em would have cost much dearer than they did. This Action cost the Besiegers about a Hundred Men Slain, and a Hundred and Fifty Wounded. The <HI>French</HI> sent out of the Castle both Horse and Dragoons to second their Men, but upon the marching of a Detachment no less nu∣merous

<PB N="20" REF="14"/>against them, they presently retreated, without making the least Attempt.</P>
<P>Upon the First of <HI>August,</HI> his Majesty caus'd an Onset to be given to the Counterscarp, before the Half Moon, and the Demi-Bastion, on the Left Hand near the <HI>Meuse.</HI> This Attack was begun about Seven a Clock in the Morning, by the <HI>English</HI> Guards, under the command of the Lord <HI>Cutts</HI> upon the Right Hand, and on the Left by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> led by Brigadier <HI>Dedem;</HI> who notwithstandig the continual Fi∣ring of the Enemy, before Ten a Clock had lodg'd them∣selves on the Right Hand, and secur'd their Lodgement. The <HI>Dutch</HI> also not being able to maintain the Work it self, lodg'd themselves upon the point of the Demi-bastion: And this Action cost the Besiegers about Four Hundred Men Kill'd and Wounded, part <HI>English</HI> and part <HI>Dutch.</HI> In this, as in all the rest of the Onsets made in the time of this Siege, the Soldiers behav'd themselves with that un∣daunted Courage and Bravery, that they carried all before them, and the Oldest and most experienc'd Officers declar'd that they never saw such vigorous Storming of Ramparts and Bulwarks before.</P>
<P>And now the Besiegers being lodg'd upon the Counter∣scarp, were preparing for a general Assault upon the Town; when upon the Third of <HI>August,</HI> about Two in the After∣noon, the Enemy hung out a white Flag, and desired a Parley; which being granted, Hostages were exchang'd, Colonel <HI>William Seymor,</HI> and Major <HI>Storek</HI> for the Besiegers, and Count <HI>Nogent,</HI> and a <HI>French</HI> Major for the Besieged.

<P>Upon the 12th of <HI>August</HI> at Night, the Besiegers broke Ground, in order to make their Approaches to the Castle, and carrying on their Trenches about 150 Paces before <HI>Cohorn</HI> Fort, toward the <HI>Sambre,</HI> made a very good Lodgment.

The 14th, the Besiegers continu'd their Works with good Success. The Night following, the Enemy made a Sally upon Six Hun∣dred of the Besiegers, commanded by Colonel <HI>Seymour,</HI> who were posted near the Palisados of the <HI>French,</HI> to secure the Pioneers that wrought in the Trenches; but the <HI>French</HI> were repulsed, and several of them Slain, and the Besiegers Works were still carried on a Hundred and Fifty Paces farther. On the Besiegers side Four Men were Slain out-right, and Twelve Wounded, among whom, Colonel <HI>Seymor</HI>'s Major, and one Captain. 'Twas said that Marshal <HI>Bouflers</HI> design'd to have taken the advantage of that Sally, and to have forc'd his way out with his Horse, but that finding the Be∣siegers had so well posted their Troops to receive him, he thought it not convenient to put his Design in Execution at that time.</P>
<P>The 15th the Besiegers made a new Trench of about Three Hundred Paces in the Plain of <HI>Salsine,</HI> behind the other which they had raised before; and ran a Line from their Lodg∣ment, as far as the old Trench at the Foot of the Moun∣tain, to secure themselves against Sallies. During which time, the Enemy were so thrifty of their Firing, that the Besiegers had only Five or Six Men Wounded.</P>
<P>The 16th the Besiegers advanc'd their Trench in the Plain of <HI>Salsine,</HI> and enlarged and mended that at the Foot of the Mountain, which had been much endamag'd by the Rain.</P>
<P>The 17th they advanc'd their Trench at the Foot of the Hill, above a Hundred Paces, and carried on that in the Plain of <HI>Salsine,</HI> in order to meet it. The next Night the
<PB N="25" REF="16"/>Enemy fir'd thick and three-fold with their Small-shot and Great Guns, and made Two Sallies to disturb the Pioneers; but were presently beaten in again; Ten private Soldiers being Kill'd out∣right, and a Colonel who commanded in the Trenches, and some others being Wounded.</P>
<P>Upon the 28th of <HI>August,</HI> about Eleven a Clock at Night, the Enemy made a Sally with about 200 Dragoons Mounted, and 500 Granadiers. The First made an Onset upon the Right Hand, with 160 Granadiers, where they were soon repuls'd by the Count of <HI>Ribera,</HI> who was visiting the Night Posts. After that, they made an Attack upon the Left Hand, where the Lord <HI>Cutts</HI> had posted his advanc'd Guards to secure the Work∣men; at what time a Hundred Dragoons came upon Lieutenant <HI>Sutton,</HI> a Lieutenant of Colonel <HI>Seymor</HI>'s Regiment, who being posted in the Plain of <HI>Salsine,</HI> with 35 Fusiliers, suffer'd 'em to advance within a few Paces of him, and then discharging all his Fire upon 'em, retreated to his main Body; after which, the Dragoons pressing hard upon him, he gave 'em a Second Vol∣ley; at what time the <HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>Bavarian</HI> Horse, who were posted in the Plain of <HI>Salsine</HI> to second the Infantry, fell in pell mell with the Enemy, and pursu'd 'em to the very gate of the Castle. In which Action, the Enemy confess'd that they had one half of their Dragoons kill'd, together with the Officer that commanded them.</P>
<P>Upon the 25th, came Letters to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> that His Majesty having receiv'd Information, that <HI>Villeroy</HI> was upon a full March to <HI>Fleurus,</HI> thought it convenient to leave the Camp before <HI>Namur</HI> to the Conduct of the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Hol∣stein Pleon,</HI> and join the Army commanded by the Prince of <HI>Vau∣demont,</HI> taking up his Quarters at <HI>Bonesee</HI> near <HI>Mazy.</HI> The next Day the Enemy made a Halt at <HI>Fleurus,</HI> being joyn'd by the De∣tachment from <HI>Germany,</HI> and the other Troops commanded by the Count <HI>de Harcourt.</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening of the same Day, the <HI>French</HI> marched to <HI>Gem∣blours,</HI> and seem'd to prepare themselves for a pitch'd Battel, for they lest their Tents, and advanc'd toward the King of <HI>England,</HI> as near as the Ground would permit. Upon which His Ma∣jesty drew out his Army, with a Resolution to engage. And
<PB N="26" REF="17"/>in that posture the whole Army continu'd all that Day; his Ma∣jesty staying in the Field in Person, from Four a Clock in the Morning, till Eight in the Evening; in which condition the <HI>Con∣federates</HI> stood ready to receive the Enemy, whenever they thought it convenient to begin.</P>
<P>And it seem'd that <HI>Villeroy</HI> had either a real intent to relieve the Besieged, or else to try what a Bravado would do. For he caus'd several Pieces of Canon to be discharg'd, which were suppos'd to be a Signal, and which were answer'd by the Besieged with Lights from the Highest part of the Castle. In the mean time, the Works before the Castle went on very well, and the Canon had made great Breaches as well in the Castle as <HI>Coehorn,</HI> insomuch that all the Discourse was of a General Assault.</P>
<P>Upon the 29th of <HI>August,</HI> came an Express from his Majesties Camp to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> giving an Account, That a General Storm had been made upon the Castle of <HI>Namur,</HI> that still it held out, which Assault was order'd in the following manner. The Lord <HI>Cutts</HI> was appointed to attack the Counterscarp and Breach of the <HI>Terra Nova,</HI> with a Detachment of Granadiers, and 4 Regiments of Infantry. Count <HI>Rivera,</HI> a Major General in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Service, was order'd to storm the <HI>Coehorn</HI> Fort, on that side next the <HI>Terra Nova,</HI> with 3000 <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Bavarians;</HI> M. General <HI>la Cave,</HI> was assign'd to attack the <HI>Coehorn</HI> on the Right Hand of the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI> with 2000 <HI>Brandenburghers,</HI> while M. Gen. <HI>Swering</HI> attack'd the <HI>Casotte</HI> with 2000 <HI>Dutch</HI> Infantry, and another Colonel at∣tack'd the Lower Town with about 2000 Men more.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> advanc'd with great Order and Resolution, and had gain'd the top of the Breach, forcing their way through Fire and Smoke on every side; but they found the Enemy so advan∣tagiously posted and entrench'd behind the Breach, and the Ground on their side so very bad, that they could not get Ground in front, but were forc'd to retire.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Rivera</HI> was Slain among the foremost, upon their first Ap∣proaches to the <HI>Coehorn;</HI> however the <HI>Bavarians</HI> posted themselves upon a Saliant Angle of the Counterscarp, and kept firing fu∣riously upon the Enemy, who endeavour'd with great Obstinacy to dislodge them: Insomuch, that when most of the Officers of the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Guards were kill'd and Wounded, and that the o∣ther
<PB N="27" REF="17"/>Regiments had suffered great Damage, the Enemy still firing with a more than ordinary Resolution, the <HI>English</HI> who had quit∣ted the <HI>Terra Nova,</HI> as not being able to do any good on that side, seconded the <HI>Bavarians</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> under the Command of the Lord <HI>Cutts,</HI> who at the same time having order'd a Lieutenant of Colonel <HI>Mackay</HI>'s Regiment, with 30 Men, to break through the Palisados, and attack a Battery of the Enemies; the Lieute∣nant executed his Orders with that undaunted Bravery, that he turn'd Seven of the Enemies Canon against themselves, and at the same instant secur'd some of their Mines; by which means the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Bavarians</HI> planted their Colours upon the Palisados, and made a good Lodgment.</P>
<P>In the mean time M. Gen. <HI>la Cave,</HI> with his <HI>Brandenburghers,</HI> and M. Gen. <HI>Swering</HI> with his <HI>Dutch-men,</HI> made each of them Two other Lodgments, of which the Besiegers continu'd in pos∣session, and presently fell to work to improve them, in order to another Assault; and the Batteries were order'd to play afresh upon the <HI>Terra Nova,</HI> to make the Breach wider, and facilitate a 2d Attack.</P>
<P>In this Action, the Loss that fell upon the Four <HI>English</HI> Regi∣ments, who made the Assault, was as follows.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Cutts</HI> Wounded.</P>
<P>Nineteen Commission Officers kill'd, and Fifty Four Wounded.</P>
<P>Private Soldiers 339. Slain outright; 682 Wounded; Volun∣teers Wounded, Col. <HI>Windsor,</HI> Mr. <HI>Thompson,</HI> Mr. <HI>Stanhope.</HI></P>
<P>Other Advice from His Majesties Camp at <HI>Ostin, Sept.</HI> 1. N.S. gave a farther Account, that during these Transactions, the Ene∣my appear'd every Day in the Front of the Confedrates Line; that on the <HI>Tuesday</HI> before, they came with about 70 Squadrons to <HI>Boneff,</HI> extending their Line from that Place, to the Right Hand, near <HI>Perwys.</HI> Upon which, his Majesty order'd the Confederate Army to move, extending his Right Wing to <HI>Longchamp,</HI> and his Left to St. <HI>Denis;</HI> and leaving a Brigade of <HI>Masy</HI> to secure that Post. The last of <HI>August,</HI> they appear'd with about Eleven Squa∣drons near the Advanc'd Guard, but were soon repuls'd.</P>
<P>The next day his Majesty having din'd Early, and in the Af∣ternoon being upon the Road, returning to the Siege, in order to give Directions for a second Attack of the Castle, was met by an Adjutant sent by the D. of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> to inform his Majesty
<PB N="28" REF="18" MS="y"/>that M. <HI>Bouflers</HI> and the Count <HI>de Guiscard</HI> had desir'd to Capitu∣late; that they had offer'd at first to treat for <HI>Coehorn</HI> Fort alone, but that being refus'd 'em by the Elector, they had agreed to capitulate for the whole.</P>
<P>Thereupon, so soon as his Majesty was arriv'd, Hostages were exchang'd, and Proposals brought from the Castle to the <HI>Salsine;</HI> the Enemy insisted at first, that they might have Ten Days time to expect Succour, but that was absolutely refus'd 'em; for it was plain, that the Enemy had suffer'd very much in the last Assault, and that they were extreamly discourag'd by their Losses.</P>
<P>So that at length upon the 2d of <HI>September,</HI> N. S. in the Morn∣ing, the Capitulation for the Surrender of the Castle of <HI>Namur</HI> was Sign'd, and the Besiegers took the possession of part of the Outworks; upon which <HI>Villeroy</HI> began to draw off, and retire with the <HI>French</HI> Army toward <HI>Flerus.</HI></P>
<P>The Substance of the Capitulation was,</P>
<Q><P>That the Outward Fortifications, that is to say the Fort of <HI>Coehorn,</HI> the Redoubt <HI>Casemate,</HI> the Hornwork of <HI>Bale,</HI> and the <HI>Casotte</HI> should be delivered up the 2d Instant by nine in the morning.</P>
<P>That the Garrison should march out with Drums beating, Colours flying, two pieces of Cannon <HI>24;</HI> two <HI>12;</HI> and two <HI>6</HI> Pounders, two Mor∣tars, and this upon the 5th Instance in the morning.</P>
<P>That they should be provided with Horses and Wagons sufficient for trans∣portation of their Equipage, and such of the Sick and Wounded as are able to depart with the Garrison, and that the Besieged might leave Officers and Commissaries to take care of the rest.</P>
<P>That no Officers shall be stopp'd for Money lent, or Goods deliver'd, provided they give Security, or Hostages for satisfaction of what they might owe.</P>
<P>That no satisfaction should be demanded for Houses demolished during the Siege, but that Cattel and Horses taken in the County of <HI>Namur</HI> be∣fore the Siege, shall be paid for.</P>
<P>All Magazines to be faithfully deliver'd up.</P>
<P>All Mines to be faithfully discover'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Of this <HI>Capitulation,</HI> Two Copies were Sign'd, One by the E∣lector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> the other by Marshal <HI>de Bouflers,</HI> and Monsieur <HI>de Guiscard.</HI></P>
