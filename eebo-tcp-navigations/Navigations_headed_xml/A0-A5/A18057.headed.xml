<HEAD>¶TO THE RIGHT VVOR∣shipful Edmond Bray Esquire, High Sherife within hir Maiesties Countie of Oxenford: I. Florio vvisheth much encrease of worship in this life, and in the Worlde to come, eternall happinesse.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He olde saying is: None so bolde as blynd Bayard: nor anye so readye to vndertake, as the leaste able to performe: Euen so (right Worshipfull) it nowe fareth with me, who (at the requests and earneste solicitations of diuers my very good frends heere in Oxforde) haue vndertaken this translation, wher∣in I holde my selfe farre inferiour to many. Howbeeit, forasmuch as that seruaunt was of his Lord and Maister most highly discommen∣ded, whiche hiding his Talent in the grounde, had thereby profited nothing: my selfe being very loath to incurre the same faulte, and so to become worthy the like reprehension, haue the rather aduentured to translate this parte of Nauigation, whiche (I assure my selfe with other mens trauel and diligence) may be an occasion of no smal com∣moditie and benefite to this our Countrie of Englande. And heerein the more to animate and encourage the Englishe Marchants, I doe onely (for breuitie sake) propose vnto them the infinite treasures (not hidden to themselues) whiche both the Spaniardes, the Portugales, and the Venetians haue seuerally gained by their suche nauigations and trauailes. Nowe (right Worshipful) when I had well considered with my selfe, that hir Maiestie hathe deemed your Worship a very meete man for that aucthoritie wherein you nowe presently remaine, I my selfe coulde not but accompt your Worship (for the present) the fittest man within the shire, to patronize and defende this my simple labour, whereby any benefite maye either happen to hir Maiesties person, or commoditie, to hir highnesse common weale: and if the wealthe of a Prince be any cause of the safetie of his person, (which, who doubteth? it may be (and not vntruly) saide to be bothe. But to the ende your Worshippe haue not altogither so muche cause to con∣demne
<PB REF="3"/>
me for this my bolde attempt vpon no maner of acquaintance, I thought it not vnfit vnto you, that I haue the rather herevnto pre∣sumed, vppon the request and warrant of my deare and welbeloued friend Maister <HI>H. Leigh,</HI> who (no doubt) is a man verie mindfull of al your Worships courtesies from time to time shewed toward him.</P>
<P>Thus not willingly desirous to be herein more tedious than is re∣quisite, I cease from troubling your good Worship, hartily praying the Almightie, to encrease the same, with abundaunce of all other vertues, to his good wil and pleasure: and withall, wholly committe my selfe vnto your Worships good disposition. From Oxenford the <HI>25.</HI> of Iune. <HI>1580.</HI></P>

<HEAD>¶To all Gentlemen, Merchants, and Pilots.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hen I had taken in hande to tran∣slate thys Treatise, which I did for the benefite and behoofe of those that shall attempt any newe disco∣uerie in the Northweast partes of <HI>America,</HI> I thought good brieflye to touch the vse of my translation, that the Reader may see and con∣sider the drift of my trauell. For, al∣though this Discourse may seeme very barraine, and not to containe suche matter as is pretended, as beyng a particular Relation of certaine Prouinces whyche haue beene hitherto of all men rather contemned than throughly knowen: yet if the Marchant Venturer, or skilfull Pilot, or whosoeuer de∣sirous of newe Discoueries, haue the readyng and perusing thereof, for whome especially I haue done it into Englishe, they will find matter worthy the looking, and consequently, gratefully accept my paines herein. For here is the Descrip∣tion of a Countrey no lesse fruitful and pleasant in al respects than is <HI>England, Fraunce,</HI> or <HI>Germany,</HI> the people, though sim∣ple and rude in manners, and destitute of the knowledge of God or any good lawes, yet of nature gentle and tractable, and most apt to receiue the Christian Religion, and to subiect themselues to some good gouernement: the commodities of the Countrey not inferiour to the Marchandize of <HI>Moscouy, Danske,</HI> or many other frequented trades: the voyage verye shorte, being but three weekes sayling from <HI>Bristowe, Plym∣mouth,</HI> or any commodious Porte of the Weast Country, with
<PB REF="4"/>
a direct course to the coast of the Newe found land. Al which oportunities besides manye others, mighte suffice to induce oure Englishemen, not onely to fall to some traffique wyth the Inhabitants, but also to plant a Colonie in some conueni∣ent place, and so to possesse the Countrey without the gain∣saying of any man, whiche was the iudgement and counsell of <HI>Iohn Baptista Ramusius,</HI> a learned and excellent Cosmogra∣pher, &amp; Secretary to the famous state of <HI>Venice,</HI> whose words, bicause they are not impertinēt to this purpose, I haue here set downe. Why doe not the Princes (saieth he) whyche are to deale in these affaires, sende forth two or three Colonies to in∣habite the Country, &amp; to reduce this sauage natiō to some ci∣uilitie? considering what a battle and fruitfull soyle it is, how replenished with all kinde of graine, how it is stored wyth al sortes of Byrdes and Beastes, wyth such faire and mighty Ri∣uers, that Captaine <HI>Carthier</HI> and his company, in one of them sayled vppe a hundreth and foure score leagues, findyng the countrey peopled on both sides in greate abundaunce. And moreouer, to cause the Gouernors of those Colonies to send forth men to search and discouer the North lands about <HI>Ter∣ra del Lauorader,</HI> and toward Weast northweast to the Seas whiche are to saile to the Country of <HI>Cataya,</HI> and from thence to the Ilands of <HI>Molucke.</HI> These were enterprises to purchase immortall praise, which the Lord <HI>Anthony di Mendoza</HI> Vice∣roy of <HI>Mexico,</HI> willing to put in execution, sent forth his Cap∣tains both by Sea and by Land vpon the Northweast of <HI>Nuo∣ua Spagona,</HI> and discouered the Kingdome of the seauen Cities about <HI>Ciuola</HI>▪ And <HI>Franciscus Vasques de Coronada,</HI> passed from <HI>Mexico</HI> by lande towarde the Northweast 2850. miles, in so muche, that he came to the Sea, whyche lyeth betweene <HI>Ca∣taya</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> where he met with the Catayan shyppes. And no doubt, if the French men in this their newe <HI>Fraunce,</HI> would haue discouered vp further into the land towards the Weast northweast partes, they shoulde haue founde the Sea, and might haue sayled to <HI>Cataya.</HI> Thus much out of <HI>Ra∣musius,</HI> where you may see this learned mans iudgement con∣cerning
<PB REF="4"/>
the planting of Colonies, and inhabiting these coun∣tries, whych might be a meane, not only to discouer the Sea on the backe-side, as he desireth, but also to come vnto the knowledge of the Countries adiacent: and namely of <HI>Sague∣nay,</HI> whiche aboundeth with Golde and other Mettalles, as in the seconde Relation is to be seene. All whyche thyngs, ex∣cepte they builde and inhabite, can neuer be atchieued, for as <HI>Fraunciscus Lopez di Gomara,</HI> and dyuers other Spanishe Au∣thors affirme, the Spanyards neuer prospered or preuailed, but where they planted: whych of the Portingales maye al∣so be verifyed, as in the Histories of all theyr Conquests and Discoueries doth manifestly appeare. And as there is none, that of right may be more bolde in this enterprice than the Englishmen, the land being first found out by <HI>Iohn Gabot</HI> the Father, and <HI>Sebastian Gabot,</HI> one of hys three sonnes, in the yeare 1494. in the name and be halfe of King <HI>Henry</HI> the sea∣uenth, as both by the foresaide <HI>Ramusius</HI> in his first Volumes, and our owne Chronicles, and <HI>Sebastian Gabots</HI> letters pa∣tents yet extant, and in his Mappe maye be seene: so there is no nation that hath so good righte, or is more fit for this pur∣pose, than they are, who trauayling yearely into those partes with 50. or 60. saile of shippes, might very commodiouslye transporte a sufficient number of men to plant a Colonie in some conuenient Hauen, and also might yeeld them yearly succour, and supply of al things necessary, receyuing againe such commodities as the country doth produce. And this the Frenchmen had done long since, if first their warres with the Spanyardes, and since their cruell dissentions at home, had not hindered them. And <HI>Iohannes Varrozzana</HI> a Florentine, if he had not beene preuented by death, purposed (as the fore∣sayde <HI>Ramusius</HI> writeth) to perswade <HI>Francis</HI> the French King to send forth good store of people to inhabite certaine places of these coastes, where the aire is moste temperate, and the soyle moste fruitfull, with goodly Riuers and Hauens suffici∣ent to harborough any nauie, the inhabitantes of which pla∣ces might be occasiō to bring many good purposes to effecte,
<PB REF="5"/>
and amongest manye others, to reduce those poore rude and ignorant people to the true worship and seruice of God, and to teache them how to manure and till the ground, transpor∣ting ouer Beastes and Cattell of <HI>Europe</HI> into those large and champion countreys, and finally, in time they might discouer vp into the land, and search, whether among so many Ilands as are there, there be any passage to the Sea of <HI>Cataya.</HI> And thus much oute of the third Volume of Voyages and Naui∣gations, gathered into the Italian tongue by <HI>Ramusius:</HI> whi∣che Bookes, if they were translated into English by the libe∣ralitie of some noble Personage, ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sea-men of <HI>England,</HI> and others, studious of Geographie, shoulde know many worthy secrets, whiche hitherto haue beene concealed. For, the beste Cosmographers of this age (as I am by the skilfull in those Sciences informed, and as to him that doth diligently consi∣der their Mappes, it shall plainely appeare) haue described <HI>Asia, Africa,</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> chiefly by the help of those bookes. But to returne to that from whence I did digresse, althoughe some attemptes of oure Countrey-men haue not had as yet suche successe as was wished, they ought not therefore to bee the slower in this enterprice, for if they were of late conten∣ted in their voyage, to haue stayed al the Winter in those col∣der Countries, if their store of victualles had beene sufficient, howe muche rather ought we nowe in a farre more tempe∣rate clime, where <HI>Iames Carthier,</HI> accompanyed wyth <HI>120.</HI> men remained a whole Winter contrary to hys determinati∣on when he set out of <HI>Fraunce?</HI> Thus beseeching God, that this my trauel may take that effect for the which it is meant, I commende the diligent consideration to al such Gentlemen, Merchants, and Pilots, as seeke Gods glory, the aduaunce∣ment of their Countrey, and the happy successe, to the proui∣dence of the Almighty, who in my opinion hath not in vaine stirred vppe the mindes of so many Honourable and Wor∣shipfull persons to the furtheraunce of these commendable and worthy Discoueries.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Fter that Sir <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Mouy,</HI> Knight, Lord of <HI>Meyleray,</HI> &amp; Vice-admirall of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> had caused all the Captaines, Maisters, and Ma∣riners of the Shippes to be sworne to behaue themselues truely and faithfully in the seruice of the most Christian King of <HI>France,</HI> vnder the charge of the sayde <HI>Carthier,</HI> vpon the <HI>20.</HI> day of Aprill. <HI>1534.</HI> we departed from the Porte of <HI>S.

Notwithstanding the saide banke, our two boa∣tes went thither to take in some Birdes, whereof there is such plentie, that vnlesse a manne didde sée them, he woulde think it an incredible thing; for albeit the Ilande (which con∣taineth aboute a league in circuite) be so full of them, that they séeme to haue béene brought thither, and sowed for the nonce, yet are there a hundreth fold as many houering about it as within, some of the which are as big as Iayes, blacke and white, with beakes lyke vnto Crowes: they houer al∣waies about the sea, they cannot flye very high, bycause their wings are so little, and no bigger than halfe ones hand, yet doe they flye as swiftly as any birdes of the ayre leuell to the water, they are also excéeding fat: we named them <HI>Aporath.</HI> In lesse than halfe an houre we filled two boats ful of them, as if they had béene with stones: so that besides them which we did eate fresh, euery ship dyd powder and salt fiue or sixe barrels ful of them.</P>

We per∣ceiued that this people might verie easily be conuerted to our religion. They go from place to place. They liue only with fishing. They haue an ordinarie time to fish for their proui∣sion. The Countrey is hotter, than the Countrey of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and the fairest that can possibly be found, altogither smooth, and leauel. There is no place, be it neuer so little, but it hathe some trées (yea albeit it be sandie) or else is ful of wilde corn, that hath an eare like vnto Rie: the corn is like Oates, small Peason as thicke as if they had bin sown &amp; plowed, white &amp; red gooseberies, strawberies, blackberies, white &amp; red Roses, w<SUP>t</SUP> many other floures, of very swéete and pleasāt smel.

stormie, so that we were constrained to draw toward shore, betwéene the saide Cape and an Ilande lying Eastwarde, a∣bout halfe a league from the Cape, where we cast Ancker for that night. The next morning we hoised sayle to trend y<SUP>e</SUP> said coaste about, which lyeth North Northeast. But there rose such a stormie and raging winde against vs, that we wer cō∣strained to come to the place againe, from whence we were come: There did we stay all that daye till the nexte, that wée hoised vp sayle, and came to the middest of a riuer fiue or sixe leagues from the Cape of <HI>Prato</HI> Northward, and being ouer∣thwart the said riuer, there arose againe a contrarie winde, with great fogges and stormes. So that we were constray∣ned vpon Tuisday, being the fourtéenth of the moneth, to en∣ter into the riuer, and there did we stay til the sixtéenth of the moneth, loking for faire weather to come out of it, on which day being Thursdaye, the winde became so raging, that one of our shippes lost an Ancker, and we were constrayned to go vp higher into the riuer seauen or eighte leagues, into a good harborough and ground, y<SUP>t</SUP> we with our boates found out, and through the euil weather, tempest, and darkenesse that was, we stayed in the saide harborough till the fiue and twentith of the month, that we coulde not come out: in the mean time we sawe a greate multitude of wilde men that were fishing for Mackrels, whereof there is great store. Their boats wer about fortie, and the persons, what with men, women, and children, two hundred, which after they had haunted our cō∣panie a while, they came very familiarly with their boates to y<SUP>e</SUP> sides of our ships. We gaue thē kniues, combs, beades of glas, &amp; other tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es of smal value, for which they made many signes of gladnesse, lifting their handes vp to Heauen, daun∣cing and singing in their boates. These men may very wel &amp; truely be called <HI>Wilde,</HI> bicause there is no poorer people in the world. For I thinke al that they had togither, besides theyr boates and nets, was not worth fiue souce. They go altogi∣ther naked, sauing their priuities, which couered with a little skinne, and certaine olde skinnes that they cast vppon them.
<PB N="20" REF="15"/>
Neyther in nature nor in language, do they any whit agrée w<SUP>t</SUP> them we found first: Their heads be altogither shauen, except one bush of haire, they suffer to grow vpon the toppe of theyr crowne, as long as a horsse taile, and then with certaine lea∣ther strings binde it in a knot vpon their heades. They haue no other dwelling but their boates, which they tourne vpside down, and vnder them they lay themselues al along vpon the bare ground. They eate their fleshe almoste rawe, onely that they heate it a little vppon imbers of coles, so doe they theyr fishe. Vpon <HI>Magdalens</HI> day we with our boates wente to the bancke of the riuer, and fréelye went on shore among them, whereat they made many signes of gladnesse, and al their mē in two or thrée companies began to sing and daunce, séeming to be very glad of our comming. They had caused al the yōg women to flée into the wood, two or thrée excepted, that stay∣ed with them, to each of which we gaue a combe, and a little bell made of Tinne, for which they were very glad, thanking our Captaine, rubbing his armes and breastes with theyr handes. When the men saw vs giue something vnto those that had stayde, it caused all the rest to come out of the wood, to the ende they should haue as muche as the others: These women were about twentie, who altogither in a knot fell vp∣on our Captaine, touching and rubbing him with their hāds, according to their manner of cherishing and making muche of one, who gaue to eache of them a little Tinne bell: then sodainely they began to daunce, and sing many songs. There we founde great store of Mackrels, that they had taken vpon the shore, with certaine nettes that they make to fishe, of a kinde of hempe that groweth in that place where ordinari∣lye they abide, for they neuer come to the sea, but onlye in fishing time. As farre as I vnderstand, ther groweth like∣wise a kinde of Millet as bigge as small Peason, like vnto that which groweth in <HI>Bresil,</HI> which they eat in stead of bread.

<P>VPon the 24. of y<SUP>e</SUP> Moneth, we caused a faire high Crosse to be made of the heigth of thirtie foote, which was made in the presence of many of them, vpon the poynt of the en∣trance of the Gulfe, in the middest whereof, we hanged vp a Shéeld with thrée Floure de Luces in it, and in the toppe was carued in the wood with Anticke letters this posse, <HI>VIVE LE ROY DE FRANCE.</HI> Then before them all we set it vp vpon the sayd poynt.

So soone as it was vp, we alto∣gither knéeled downe before them, with our hands towarde Heauen, yéelding God thankes: and we made signes vnto them, shewing them the Heauens, and that all our saluation dependeth only on him which in them dwelleth: whereat they shewed a great admiration, looking first one at another, and then vpon the Crosse. And after we were returned to oure Shippes, their Captayne clad with an old Beares Skinne, with thrée of his Sonnes, and a Brother of his with him, came vnto vs in one of their Boates, but they came not so néere vs as they were wont to do: there he made a long Ora∣tion vnto vs, shewing vs the crosse we had set vp, and making

a Crosse with two of his fingers, then did he shew vs all the Countrey about vs, as if he would say that all was his, and that we should not set vp any Crosse without his leaue. His talke being ended, we shewed him an Axe, fayning that we would giue it him for his skinne, to whiche he listned, for by little and little he came néere our Ships. One of our fellowes that was in our boate, tooke holde on theirs, &amp; suddaynely lept into it, with two or thrée more, who enforced him to enter in∣to our Ships, whereat they were greatly astonished. But our Captaine did straightwayes assure thē, that they should haue no harme, nor any iniury offered them at all, and entertained them very frendly, making them eate and drinke. Then did we shew them with signes, that the Crosse was but only set vp to be as a light and leader which wayes to enter into the port, and that we would shortly come againe, and bring good store of iron wares and other things, but that we would take two of his children with vs, and afterward bring them to the said port againe: and so we clothed two of them in shirtes, and coloured coates, with red cappes, and put about euery ones necke a copper chaine, whereat they were greatly contented: then gaue they their old clothes to their fellowes that wente backe againe, and we gaue to each one of those thrée that wēt backe, a hatchet, and some kniues, which made thē very glad. After these were gone, and had told the newes vnto their fel∣lowes, in the after noone there came to our ships sixe boates of them, with fiue or sixe men in euery one, to take their fare∣wels of those two we had retained to take with vs, and brought them some fish, vttering many words which we did not vnderstand, making signes that they woulde not remoue the Crosse we had set vp.</P>

them, where so soone as we came, we assembled togither all our Captaynes, Maysters, and Marriners, to haue their ad∣uice and opinion what was best to be done: and after that e∣uery one had sayd, considering that the Easterly windes be∣ganne to beare sway, and blow, and that the floud was so great, that we did but fall, and that there was nothing to be gotten, and that stormes and tempestes beganne to puffe in those new Countreys, and that we were so farre from home, not knowing the perils and dangers were behind, for eyther we must agrée to turne and come backe againe, or else to stay there all the yeare. Moreouer, we did consider, that if an ex∣change of the Northerne windes did take vs, it were not pos∣sible for vs to depart thence. All which opinions being heard and considered, we altogither determined to addresse oure selues homeward. Now bycause vpon <HI>Saint Peeters</HI> day we entred into the sayde straighte, we named it <HI>Saint Peeters Straight.</HI> We sounded it in many places, in some we found <HI>70.</HI> faddome water, in some <HI>50.</HI> and néere the shoare but <HI>30.</HI> and cléere ground. From that day till Wensday following, we had a good and prosperous gale of wind, that we trended the sayd land about on the North East South-east, Weast and North-weast sides: for such is the situation of it, excepted one Cape of low lands that bendeth towarde South-east, a∣bout <HI>25.</HI> leagues from the straight. In this place we sawe certayne smokes, that the people of the Countrey made vp∣pon the sayd Cape: but bycause the winde blew vs towarde the coast, we went not to them, whiche when they saw, they came with two Boates and twelue men vnto vs, and as fréelie came vnto our Shippes, as if they had bin <HI>French</HI> men, and gaue vs to vnderstande, that they came from the greate Gulfe, and that <HI>Tiennot</HI> was their Captayne, who then was vpon that Cape, making signes vnto vs, that they were going home to their Countreys where we were come from with our Shippes, and that they were laden with Fish.

All the land lyeth low, very pleasant, enuironed with sand, where the sea is entermingled with marishes and shal∣lowes, the space of twentie leagues: then doth the land begin to trend from Weast to East, North-east altogither enuiro∣ned with Ilands two or thrée leagues from land, in whiche as farre as we could sée, are many dangerous shealues more than foure or fiue leagues from land.</P>

The Wensday following, bée∣ing the <HI>19.</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> there rose a good gale of winde, and there∣fore we hoysed Sayle with thrée Shippes, that is to say, the great <HI>Hermina,</HI> being in burthen about a hundreth, or a hun∣dreth and twentie Tunne, wherein the foresayde Captayne <HI>Iames Carthier</HI> was Generall, and Maister <HI>Thomas Fros∣mont</HI> chiefe Mayster, accompanyed with Mayster <HI>Claudius</HI> of <HI>Pont Briand,</HI> Sonne to the Lord of <HI>Monteceuell,</HI> and Cupbea∣rer to the Dolphin of <HI>France▪ <HI>Charles</HI></HI> of <HI>Pomera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, <HI>Iohn Pow∣let,</HI></HI> and other Gentlemen.

at which time the weather tourned into stormes &amp; tē∣pests, y<SUP>e</SUP> which with contrarie winds, and darkenesse, endured so long y<SUP>t</SUP> our ships being without any rest, suffered as much as any ships that euer went on seas: so that the <HI>25.</HI> of Iune, by reason of that foule and foggie weather, all our shippes loste sight one of another, neyther sawe we one another againe tyll we came to the newe lande where we had appointed to méet. After we had lost one another, we in the Generals ship were with contrarie windes tost too and fro on the sea, vntil the se∣uenth of Iuly, vpon which daye we arriued and came to the Iland called <HI>the Iland of Byrdes,</HI> which lyeth from the main lande <HI>.44.</HI> leagues. This Ilande is so full of byrdes, that all our ships might easily haue bin fraighted with them, and yet for the great number that there is, it wold not séeme that any were taken away. We to victual our selues filled two boats of them. This Iland hath the Pole eleuated <HI>.49.</HI> degrées, and <HI>40.</HI> minutes. Vppon the eight of the sayde moneth we sayled further, and with a prosperous weather came to the Porte called <HI>The Port of white Sandes,</HI> that is in the Baie called <HI>The Baie of Castels,</HI> where we had purposed to méete and stay togither the fiftéenth of the said month.

The length frō <HI>S.

turned Northeast, and then bending toward it, leaue it on the left hand, and you shall finde thrée fadome water, and within the Hauen but two. Also you are to take héede of two shelues that leane outwarde halfe a league. All this coaste is full of quicke sandes and very daungerous, albeit in sighte manye good Hauens séeme to be there, yet is there nought else but shelues and sandes. We staide and rested our selues in the sayde Hauen, vntill the seauenth of August being Sundaye: on whiche daye we hoysed sayle, and came towarde lande one the neather side towarde <HI>Rabasts Cape,</HI> distant from the sayd Hauen about twentie leagues North Northeast, and South Southweast: but the nexte daye there rose a stormie and a contrarie winde, and therefore we coulde finde no Hauen there towarde the South. Thence we wente coasting along toward the North, beyonde the aboue-sayde Hauen aboute tenne leagues, where we founde a goodly greate gulfe, full of Ilandes, passages, and entraunces towarde what winde so∣euer you please to bend: for the knowledge of this gulfe there is a greate Ilande that is a Cape of the maine lande, stret∣ching somewhat further foorth than the others, and aboute two leagues wythin the lande, there is an Hill fashioned as it were an heape of corne. We named the sayde Gulfe <HI>Saint Laurence hys Baie.</HI> The twelfth of the sayde month we went from the sayd <HI>S.

The next daye af∣ter our Ladie day in August, being the fiftéenth of the month, hauing past those straightes, where we had notice of certaine landes that we left toward the South, whiche landes are full of very high hilles, and therfore we named them <HI>The Ilands of the Assumption,</HI> and one Cape of the sayd high countryes lyeth East north-easte, and Weste south-west, the distaunce betwéene which, is about fiue &amp; twentie leagues. The Coun∣tryes lying North, maye playnely be perceyued to be higher thā the Southerly more than thirtie leagues. We trended y<SUP>e</SUP> saide landes about towarde the South, frō the said day vntyl Twesday noone following, the winde being in the West, and therfore we bended toward the North, purposing to go and sée the land that we before had spyed. Being arriued there, wée founde the sayd Ilands, as it were ioyned togither, and lowe toward the Sea.

<HEAD>¶ How our Captain caused the shippes to retourne backe again, only to know if in <HI>Saint Laurence</HI> gulfe there were any passage towarde the North. CHAP. 2.</HEAD>
<P>VPon the 18. of August being Wednesday, our Captain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> caused his shippes to winde backe, and bend toward the other shore, so that we trended the sayd Northerly cost, whi∣che runneth South-east, &amp; North-west, being fashioned like vnto halfe a bowe, and is a very high land, but yet not so high as that on the Southerly partes. The Thursday following we came to seuen very high Ilandes, whiche we named <HI>The round Ilands.</HI> These Ilandes are distant from the others a∣bout fourtie leagues, and stretche out into the Sea aboute thrée or foure leagues. Aboute these there are goodly lowe groundes to be séene full of goodlye trées, whiche we the Fry∣day following, with our boates compassed aboute. Ouer∣thwart these Ilandes there are diuerse sandie shelues more than two leagues into the sea, very daungerous, whiche at a a lowe water remaine almost dry. At the furthest boundes of these lowe Ilands, that containe about tenne leagues, ther is a riuer of fresh water, that with such swiftnesse runneth into the sea, that for the space of one league within it the water is as freshe as anye fountaine water. We with our boates entred into the saide riuer, at the entraunce of whiche we foūd about one fadome water. There are in this riuer many fishes shaped like horsses, which as our wilde men told vs, al the daye long lye in the water, and the night on lande: of which we sawe therein a great number. The next day being the one and twentith of the month, by breake of day we hoy∣sed sayle, and sayled so long about the sayde coaste, that wée had sight of the Northerly partes of it, which as yet we had not séene, and of the Iland of the <HI>Assumption</HI> which we had founde, departing from the sayde land: which thing so soon as we had done, and that we were certifyed no other passage to be there, we came to our shippe againe, whiche we had left at
<PB N="34" REF="22"/>
the said Ilands, where is a good harborough, the water being about nine or ten faddome. In the same place by occasion of contrarie winds and foggie mystes, we were constrayned to stay, not being either able to come out of it, or hoyse sayle til the four &amp; twentith of the month. On which day we departed &amp; came to a hauen on the Southerly coast, about 80. leagues from the said Ilands. This hauen is ouer against thrée flat Ilāds y<SUP>t</SUP> lye amidst a riuer, bycause on the half way of y<SUP>e</SUP> sayd Ilands, &amp; the said Hauen toward the North, there is a verye great riuer that runneth betwéene the high &amp; low Ilands, &amp; more than thrée leagues into the sea: it hath many shelues, &amp; there is not altogither one fadome water, so that the place is very dangerous: &amp; from bank to bancke of the saide shelues, there is either xv. or xx. yardes. All the Northerly cost rūneth East Northeast and South Southwest. The saide hauen wherin we stayed, is as it were but a sluce of the waters that rise by the floud, and but of smal accompt, we named them <HI>S. Iohns Isleetes,</HI> bycause we founde them, and entred into thē the day of the beheading of that Saint. Aboute fiue leagues afore you come to the said hauen Westward, there is no pas∣sage at al but only with little boates. The hauen of <HI>S. Iohns Islettes,</HI> dryeth vp all the waters that rise by flowing, yea if it flowe a faddome. The best place to harborough ships ther∣in is on the South part of a certaine little Islande that is o∣uer against the sayde hauen, whereby the bancke or shore of of the Iland riseth. Vpon the first of September we departed out of the said hauen, purposing to go towarde <HI>Canada,</HI> and a∣bout <HI>15.</HI> leagues from it towarde West Southwest, amidst y<SUP>e</SUP> riuer there are thrée Ilandes, ouer against the whiche the ri∣uer runneth swift, and is of a great depth, &amp; it is that which leadeth, and runneth into the Countrey and kingdome of <HI>Saguenay,</HI> as by the two wilde men of <HI>Canada</HI> it was tolde vs. Thys riuer, passeth and runneth along very high and stéepe hilles of bare stone, where very little earth is, and notwith∣standing there is greate quantitie of sundrie sortes of trées that growe in the sayde bare stones, euen as vppon good and
<PB N="35" REF="22"/>
fertile ground, in such sorte that we haue séene some so great as well woulde suffise to make a maste for a shippe of fortie Tunne burden, and as gréene as possible can be growing, in a stonie rocke without any earth at all. At the entraunce of the sayd riuer we mette with foure boates ful of wilde men, whiche as farre as we coulde perceyue, verye fearefullye came toward vs, so that some of them went backe agayne, &amp; the other came as neare vs as easilye they might heare and vnderstond one of our wilde men, who tolde them his name, and then toke acquaintaunce of them, vpon whose word they came to vs. The nexte day, being the seconde of September, we came out of the riuer to goe to <HI>Canada,</HI> and by reason of the Seas flowing, the tide was verie swifte and daungerous for that on the South part of it there lye two Ilandes, about whiche more than thrée leagues compasse, lye manye greate stones, and but two faddome water: and the flowing amidst those Ilandes, is verye vnconstante and doubtefull, that if it hadde not bene for our boates, we hadde bene in great dā∣ger to loose our liues: and coasting along the saide dry sands, there is more than fiftéen fadome water. About fiue leagues beyonde the riuer of <HI>Saguenay</HI> Southweast, there is another Ilande more Northerly acrosse, whiche are certaine highe péeces of lande, and thereaboutes we thought to haue caste Ancker on purpose to staye the nexte tide, but we could sound no ground by thrée score fadome within a flighte shoote from shoare, so that we were constrayned to winde backe to the sayde Ilande, where wée sounded againe, and founde eightéene faddome. The nexte mornyng we hoysed saile and wente thence, sayling further on, where wée hadde notice of a certayne kinde of fishe neuer to-fore of a∣nye manne séene or knowen. They are aboute the big∣nesse of a Purpois, yet nothing like them, of bodye verye well proportioned, headed lyke Graye-houndes, altogi∣ther as white as Snowe, wythout anye spotte, within which Riuer there is great quantitie of them: they do liue altogyther betwéene the Sea and the freshe Water.

These of the Countrey call them <HI>ADHOTHVYS,</HI> they folde vs that they be very sauorye and good to be eaten. Moreouer they affirme none to be foūd else-wher but in that riuer. The sixth of the month, the weather being calme &amp; faire, we went about fiftéene leagues more vpward into the riuer, and there lighted on an Iland that looketh Northward, and it maketh a little hauen or créeke wherin are many &amp; innumerable great Tortoyzes, continuallye lying about that Ilande. There are likewise great quantitie of the said <HI>Aphothuys</HI> taken by the inhabitours of the Coūtry, so that there is as gret concourse and méeting in that place as is at <HI>Bordeous</HI> in <HI>Fraunce</HI> at e∣uery tide. This Iland is in length about thrée leagues, and in bredth two, and is a goodly and fertile plot of ground, reple∣nished with many goodly and great trées of manye sortes. A∣mong the rest ther are many Filburde trées, which we found hanging full of them, somewhat bigger and better in sauour than ours, but somewhat harder, and therefore we called it <HI>The Iland of Filburdes.</HI> The seuenth of the month, being our Ladies euen, after seruice we went from that Ilande, to goe vp higher into the riuer, and came to the <HI>Fourteene Ilandes,</HI> seauen or eight leagues from the <HI>Ilande of Filburdes,</HI> where the Countrey of <HI>Canada</HI> beginneth, one of which Ilandes is ten leagues in length, and fiue in bredth, greatlye inhabited of such men as onlie liue by fishing of suche sortes of fishes as the riuer affourdeth, according to the seasō of them. After we had cast Ancker betwéene the sayde Ilande, and the Nor∣therly coast, we went on lande and tooke our two wilde men with vs, méeting with many of those Countrey people, who woulde not at all approch vnto vs, but rather fledde from vs vntill our two men beganne to speake vnto them, telling thē that they wer <HI>Taignoagny</HI> &amp; <HI>Domagaia,</HI> who so soone as they had takē aquaintance of thē, began greatly to reioyce, daun∣cing and shewing many sorts of ceremonies: and many of the chiefest of thē came to our boats &amp; brought many Eles, &amp; o∣ther sorts of fishes, with two or thrée burdens of great <HI>Millet</HI> wherwith they make their bread, &amp; many gret mus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> milions.

The same daye came also manye other boates full of those Countreymen and Women, to sée and take aquaintance of our two mē, al which were as courteously receyued, &amp; friend∣ly entertayned of our Captayne, as possible could be. And to haue them the better acquaynted with him, and make them his friends, he gaue them many small giftes, but of small va∣lue: neuerthelesse, they were greatly contented with them. The next day following, the Lorde of <HI>Canada</HI> (whose proper name was <HI>Donnacona</HI>) but by the name of Lorde, they call him <HI>Agouhanna,</HI> with twelue boates came to our Ships, accompanyed of many people, who causing tenne of hys Boates to go backe with the other two, approched vnto vs with sixtéene men more. Then began the sayde <HI>Agouhanna</HI> being néerest vnto our Shippe, according to their manner and fashion, to frame a long Oration, mouing all his bodie and members after a strange fashion, whiche thing is a Ce∣remonie and signe of gladnesse and securitie among them, and then comming to the Generals Shippe, where <HI>Taigno∣agny,</HI> and <HI>Domagaia</HI> spake with them, and they with him, where they began to tell and shewe vnto him what they had séene in <HI>Fraunce,</HI> and what good entertainment they had had, hearing which things, the Lorde séemed to be very glad of, &amp; prayed our Captain to reach him his arme, that he might kisse it, whych thing he did: their Lord taking it, laid it about his necke, for so they vse to do when they will make much of one. Then our Captayne entred into <HI>Agouhannas</HI> boate, causing bread and wine to be brought, to make the sayd Lord and his companie to eate and drinke, which thing they did, and were greatly thereby contented and satisfyed. Our Cap∣tayne for that time gaue them nothing, bycause he looked for a fitter oportunitie. These things being done, each one tooke leaue of others, and the Lord went with his boates agayne where he was come from. Our Captayne then caused oure boates to be set in order, that with the next tide he might goe vp higher into the Riuer, to finde some harborough wherein to set our Ships: and the next tide we went coasting alongst
<PB N="38" REF="24"/>
the said Iland, about tenne leagues, at the ende whereof, we found a goodly and pleasant sluce of water, where is another little riuer and hauen, where by reason of the flo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d there, is two faddome water. This place séemed to vs very fitte and commodious to put our ships therein, and so we did very safe∣ly, we named it the holy Crosse, for on that day we came thi∣ther. Néere vnto it, there is a village, whereof <HI>Donnacona</HI> is Lord, and there he kéepeth his abode: it is called <HI>Stad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gona,</HI> as goodly a plot of ground as possibly may be séene, and there∣withall very fruitefull, full of goodly trees euen as in <HI>France,</HI> as Oakes, Elmes, Ashes, Walnut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> trées, Maple trées, Ci∣drons, Vines, and white Thornes, that bring foorth fruite as big as any Damsons, and many other sortes of trées, vnder which groweth as faire tall hemp, as any in <HI>France,</HI> without any séede, or any mans worke or labour at all.

Then did we perceyue, that whatsoeuer <HI>Taignoagny</HI> spake, was only long of himself, and of his fellow, for that our Cap∣taine departed thence. He and <HI>Donnacona</HI> entred into a mar∣uellous stedfast league of friendship, whereby all his people at once with a loude voyce, cast out thrée great cryes, (a hor∣rible thing to heare) and each one hauing taken licence of the other for that day, we wente a boord agayne. The day follo∣wing, we put our two great Shippes within the Riuer and harborough, where the waters being at the highest, are but one fadome and halfe déepe, and at the lowest, but halfe a fa∣dome. We left our Galion without the sluce, to the ende we might bring it to <HI>Hochelaga.</HI> So soone as we had safely pla∣ced our Shippes, behold, we saw <HI>Donnacona, Taignoagny,</HI> and <HI>Domagaia,</HI> with more than fiue hundred persons, men, women, and children, and the Lorde with tenne or twelue of the chiefest of the Countrey came a boord of our shippes, who were all courteously receyued, and friendly entertayned, both of our Captayne, and of all vs: and diuers giftes of small va∣lue were giuen them. Then did <HI>Taignoagny</HI> tell our Cap∣tayne, that his Lord did greatly sorrow that he woulde go to <HI>Hochelaga,</HI> and that he would not by any meanes permit that any of them should goe with him, and that the Riuer was of no importance. Our Captayne answered him, that for all his saying, he woulde not leaue off his going thither, if by anye meanes it were possible, for that he was commanded by his King to goe as farre as possibly he could: and that if he (that is to say <HI>Taignoagny</HI>) would go with him, as he had promi∣sed
<PB N="41" REF="25"/>
he shoulde be very wel entertained, beside that, he should haue such a gifte giuen him, as he shoulde wel content him∣selfe: for hée shoulde doe nothing else but goe with hym to <HI>Hochelaga,</HI> and come againe. To whome <HI>Taignoagny</HI> aun∣swered, that he woulde not by any meanes go, and therevp∣on sodainely returned to their houses. The nexte day beyng the <HI>17.</HI> of September, <HI>Donnacona</HI> retourned euen as at the firste, and brought with him many Eeles, with sundry sorts of other fishes, whereof they take greate store in the sayde Riuer, as more largely hereafter shall be shewed. And as soone as they were come to our Shippes, according to their wonted vse beganne to sing and daunce. This done, <HI>Donna∣cona</HI> caused all his people to be sette of one side, then making a rounde circle vpon the Sand, caused our Captaine with al his people to enter therein, then he beganne to make a long Oration: holding in one of his handes a Maiden child <HI>10.</HI> or <HI>12.</HI> yeares olde, whych he presented vnto our Captaine: then sodainely beganne his people to sende out thrée shréekes or howles, in signe of ioy and league of friendshippe, presently vpon that he did present vnto him two other yong Male chil∣dren one after another, but yonger than the other, at the gy∣uing of whyche, euen as before, they gaue oute shréekes and howles very lowde, with other ceremonies: for whyche pre∣sents, our Capitaine gaue the saide Lorde greate and hearty thankes. The Lord tolde our Captaine then, that one of the children was his owne brother, and that the Maiden childe was daughter vnto his owne sister, and these presents were onely giuen him, to the end he should not goe to <HI>Hochelaga</HI> at all, to whome our Captaine answered, that if they were onely giuen hym to that intent, if so he would he should take them againe, for that by no meanes he woulde leaue hys goyng off, for as much as he was commaunded of his King. But concerning this, <HI>Domagaia</HI> tolde oure Capitaine, that their Lorde had gyuen him those children as a signe and to∣ken of goodwill and friendshippe, and that he was contented to goe wyth him to <HI>Hochelaga,</HI> vppon whyche talke greate

<P>THe next day being the 19. of September we hoised saile, and with our Gallion and two boates departed to go vp the riuer with the floude, where on both shoares of it we be∣ganne to sée as goodly a countrey as possibly can with eye be séene, all replenished with very goodly trées, and Vines la∣den as full of Grapes as coulde be all along the riuer; why∣che rather séemed to haue bene planted and wrought by han∣dy worke than otherwise. True it is, that bycause they are not dressed and wrought as they shoulde be, theyr bunches of Grapes are not so great as ours, also we sawe all along the riuer many horses inhabited of Fishers, whyche take all kyndes of fishes, and they with great familiaritie and kind∣nesse came vnto vs, euen as if we had bene theyr Countrey∣men, and brought vs greate store of fishe, suche as they hadde with other thyngs, whyche we exchaunged with them for o∣ther wares, who lifting vp their hands toward heauen, gaue many signes of ioy: we stayed at a place called <HI>Hochela<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> a∣bout 25. leagues from <HI>Canada,</HI> where the riuer waxeth very narrowe, and runneth very swift, wherefore it is very dan∣gerous, not only for that, but also for certain gret stones that are therein: Many boates and barkes came vnto vs, in one of whiche came one of the chéefe Lordes of the Countrey, making a long discourse, who beyng come néere vs, did by e∣uident signes and gestures shewe vs, that the higher the Ri∣uer went, the more daungerous it was, and bade vs take héede of our selues.

for it was but thrée yeares olde. Our Captaine as friendly and as courteously dyd entertaine and receyue the sayd Lord and his company, giuing thē certaine small trifles, &amp; so they departed towarde shoare againe. Afterwards the said Lord, his wife, and his daughter, came to visite oure Capitayne at <HI>Canada,</HI> bringing hym certaine small presents. From the 19. vntill the 28. of September, wée sailed vp along the saide ri∣uer, neuer losing one houre of time, all whyche time we saw as goodly and pleasant a Country as possibly can be wished for, full (as we haue saide before) of all sortes of goodlye trées, that is to say, Oakes, Elmes, Walnut-trées, Ce∣drons, Firres, Ashes, Boxe, Willowes, and greate store of Vines, all as full of Grapes as coulde be, that if anye of our fellowes went on shoare, they came home laden wyth them: there are likewise many Cranes, Swannes, Géese, Duckes, Feasants, Partridges, Thrushes, Blacke-birdes, Turtles, Finches, Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>breastes, Nightingales, Sparrowes, with many other sorts of Birds, euen as in <HI>France,</HI> and great plentie and store. Vpon the 28. of September, wée came to a gret wide lake in the middle of y<SUP>e</SUP> riuer fiue or sixe leagues broade, and twelue long, all that day we wente againste the tide, hauyng but one faddome water, still kéeping the saide scantling: beyng come to one of the heades of the Lake, wée coulde espye no passage or going out; nay, rather it séemed to haue bene closed and shutte vppe rounde about, and there was but halfe a faddome water, lyttle more or lesse. And therefore we were constrayned to caste Ancker, and staye with our Gallion, and wente with oure two boates to séeke some going out, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e place we found four or fiue bran∣ches, whyche out of the riuer come into the Lake, and they come from <HI>Hoche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aga.</HI> But in the saide braunches, bicause of the greate fiercenesse and swiftnesse wherewith they breake out, and the course of the water, they make certaine Créekes▪ and goings acrosse, yet at that time there was but halfe a faddome water. Those Créekes beyng passed, we found thrée fadome, and as farre as we could perceiue by the floud

Our boates beyng somewhat neare the shoare, one of them tooke our Captaine in his armes, and ca∣ried him on shoare, as lightly and as easilie, as if he had bene a child of fiue olde: so strong and sturdy are those people. We founde, that they had a greate heape of wilde Mice that lyue in the water, as big as a Conny, and very good to eate, which they gaue vnto our Captaine, who for a recompence gaue them kniues and glazen Beades.

After we had gone about foure or fiue leagues, we met by the way one of the chiefest Lords of the Citie, accompanyed with manye mo, who so soone as he saw vs, beckned and made signes vn∣to vs, that we must rest vs in that place, where they had made a great fire, and so we did.

very fertile, on the toppe of whiche, you may sée ve∣rye farre, wée named it <HI>Mounte Roiall.</HI> The Cittie of <HI>Hochelaga</HI> is rounde, compassed aboute with timber, with thrée course of Rampires, one within another, framed like a sharpe Spire, but layde acrosse aboue. The middle∣most of them is made and builte as a directe line, but per∣pendicular. The Rampires are framed and fashioned with péeces of Timber, layde along on the grounde, very well and cunningly ioyned togither after their fashion. This en∣closure is in heigth aboute two roddes.

They make also sundrye sortes of Pottage with the sayde Corne of Pease, and of Beanes, where∣of they haue greate store: also with other fruites, as

They haue al∣so in their Houses certayne Vessels, as bigge as anye Boate, or Tunne, wherein they preserue and kéepe, their fishe, causing the same in Sommer to be dryed in the Sunne, and liue therewith in Winter, whereof they make greate prouision, as we by experience haue séene. All their viandes and meates are without any tast or sauoure of salt at all. They sléepe vpon barkes of Trées layde all along vpon the grounde, with the Skinnes of certayne wilde Beastes, wherewith they also cloth and couer themselues.

That done, the menne caused the Women to withdrawe themselues backe, then they euery one late downe on the ground round about vs, as if they would haue shewen and rehearsed some Comedie, or other shew: then presently came the Women agayne, euery one bringing a fouresquare Matte in manner of Carpettes, and spreading them abroad on the ground in that place: then they caused vs to sit vpon them. That done, the Lord &amp; King of y<SUP>e</SUP> country was brought vpon nine or ten mens shoulders, (whome in theyr toung they call <HI>AGOVHANNA</HI>) sitting vpon a great Stagges Skinne, and they layde him downe vpon the forsayde mattes néere to our Captayne, euery one beckning vnto vs that he was theyr Lord and King. This <HI>Agouhanna</HI> was a manne aboute fiftie yeares olde: he was no whitte better apparelled than any of the rest, onely ex∣cepted,
<PB N="53" REF="31"/>
that he had a certaine thing made of beasts Skinnes (called <HI>Ricc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>) like a redde towell, and that was in steade of his Crowne. He was full of the palsey, and his members shronke togither. After he had with certayne signes and beckes saluted our Captaine and all his company, and by manifest tokens bidde vs all welcome, he shewed his legges and armes to our Captaine, and with signes desi∣red him to touch them, and so he did, rubbing them with hys owne hands: then did <HI>Agouhanna</HI> take the wreath or crown he had about his head, and gaue it vnto our Captaine, that done, they broughte before him diuerse diseased men, some blinde, some criple, some lame and impotent, and some so olde that the heare of their eyeléeds came downe and couered their Chéekes, and laide them al along before our Captaine, to the ende they mighte of him be touched: for it séemed vnto them that God hadde bene descended and come downe from Heauen to heale them. Our Captaine séeing the misery and deuotiō of this poore people, recited the Gospel of <HI>Saint Iohn,</HI> that is to saye, <HI>In the beginning was the word:</HI> touching eue∣rie one that were diseased, praying to God that it wold please him to open the harts of this poore people, and to make them knowe his holy worde, and that they might receiue baptisme and Christendome: that done, he toke a booke in his hande, &amp; with a lowde voyce redde all the passion of Christ, worde by word, that al the bystanders might hear him, al which while this poore people kept silence, &amp; were maruellously attentiue, loking vp to heauē, &amp; imitating vs in gesturs. Thē h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> caused he men al orderly to be set on one side, y<SUP>e</SUP> womē on another, &amp; likewise the children on another, and to the chiefest of them he gaue Hatchets, to the other kniues, and to the women beades, and such other smal trifles. Then where the children were, he caste rings, counters, and branches made of Tin, whereat they séemed to be verie gladde. That done, our Cap∣taine commaunded Shaw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, and other musical instrumēts to be sounded, which when they heard, they were very mer∣rie.

When we were out of the Towne, diuerse of the men and women followed vs, and broughte vs to the toppe of the forsayde mountaine, which we named <HI>Mount Roiall,</HI> it is aboute a league from the Town.

They gaue vs also to vnderstande that those <HI>Agouionda,</HI> doe continuallye warre againste them: but bycause we dyd not vnderstande them well, wée coulde not perceyue how farre it was to that Countrey. Our Captaine shewed them redde Copper, whyche in theyr language they call <HI>Caignetadze,</HI> and lookyng towarde that Countrey wyth signes, asked them if anye came from thence, they shakyng theyr heades aunsweared no: but they shewed vs that it came from <HI>Saguenay,</HI> and that lyeth cleane contrarye to the other.

<P>THe sayd Riuer beginneth beyond the Iland of <HI>Thassump∣cion,</HI> ouer against the high Mountaynes of <HI>Honguedo,</HI> and of the seauen Ilands. The distance ouer from one side to the other, is about 35. or 40. leagues. In the middest it is aboue 100. faddome deepe. The surest way to sayle vpon it, is on the South side, and towarde the North, that is to say, from the sayd seauen Ilandes, where from side to side, there is seauen leagues, where are also two great Riuers that come downe from the hilles of <HI>Saguenay,</HI> and make diuers very dangerous shealues in the Sea. At the entrance of those two Riuers, we saw many and great store of Whales, and sea Horses. Ouer∣thwart the sayd Ilands, there is another little Riuer that runneth along those marrish groundes about thrée or foure leagues, wherein there is great store of water fowles. From the head of that Riuer to <HI>Hochelaga,</HI> there is about thrée hun∣dred leagues: the originall beginning of it is in the riuer that commeth from <HI>Saguenay,</HI> which riseth and springeth among high and stéepe hilles: it entreth into that Riuer before it com∣meth to the prouince of <HI>Canada</HI> on the North side. That riuer is very déepe, high, and straight, wherefore it is very dange∣rous for any vessell to goe vpon it. After that riuer, followeth the prouince of <HI>Canada,</HI> wherein are many people dwelling in open boroughes and villages. There are also in the circuite and territorie of <HI>Canada,</HI> along, and within the sayd riuer, ma∣ny other Ilands, some great, and some small, among whiche, there is one that conteyneth aboue tenne leagues in length, full of goodly and high tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and also many Vines.

That is the place and abode of <HI>Donnacona,</HI> and of our two men we tooke in our firste voyage, it is called <HI>Stadagona.</HI> But be∣fore we come to it, there are foure other peopled Townes, that is to say, <HI>Ayraste, Starnatan, Tailla,</HI> whiche standeth vp∣pon a hill, and <HI>Scitadin,</HI> and then <HI>Stadagona,</HI> vnder whiche Towne toward the North, the Riuer and Porte of the ho∣ly Crosse is, where we stayd from the fiftenth of September, vntill the sixtéenth of May 1536. and there oure Shippes re∣mayned drie▪ as we haue sayde before. That place béeing past, we found the habitation of the people called <HI>Teguenon∣dahi,</HI> standing vpon an high Mountayne, and the valley of <HI>Hochelay,</HI> whiche standeth in a Champaigne Countrey. All that Countrey is full of sundrye sortes of woodde, and ma∣ny Vynes, vnlesse it be about the places that are inhabited, where they haue pulled vp the Trées to till and laboure the grounde, and to builde their Houses and Lodgings. There is greate store of Stagges, Déeres, Beares, and other suche lyke sortes of Beastes, as Connies, Hares, Mar∣tons, Foxes, Otters, Weasels, Badgers, and Mice excée∣ding greate, and diuers other sortes of Venison. They cloath themselues with the Skinnes of those Beastes, bycause they haue nothing else to make them apparell withall.

<HEAD>¶ Of a strange and cruell disease that came to the people of <HI>Stadagona,</HI> wherwith bycause we did haunt their com∣pany, we wer so infected, that there died 25. of our com∣panye. CHAP. 13.</HEAD>
<P>IN the moneth of December, we vnderstoode that the Plague or Pestilence was come to the people of <HI>Stadago∣na,</HI> in such sort, that before we knew of it, according to their confession, there were dead aboue 50. wherevpon we forbad them neyther to come néere our Forte, nor about our Ships, or vs. And albeit we had driuen them from vs, the sayd vn∣knowen sicknesse beganne to spread it selfe amongst vs, after the strangest sort that euer was eyther heard of or séene, in so much, as some did lose all their strength, and could not stand on their féete, then did theyr legges swell, their sinnowes shrinke as blacke as any cole. To others, all their Skinnes was spotted with spottes of bloud of a purple couloure: then did it ascende vp alofte to theyr anckles, knées, thighes, shoul∣ders, armes, and necke: their mouth became stincking, their gummes so rotten, that all the flesh did fall off, euen to the rootes of the Téeth, which did also almost all fall out. With such infection did this Sicknesse spreade it selfe in oure thrée Shippes▪ that aboute the middle of February, of a hundreth and tenne persons that we were, there were
<PB N="95" REF="37"/>
not tenne whole, so that one coulde not helpe the other, a moste horrible and pitifull case, considering the place wée were in, forsomuch as the people of the Country would day∣ly come before our forte, and saw but few of vs. There were alreadie eight deade, and more than fiftie sicke, and as wée thought, past al hope of recouerie. Our Captaine séeing this our misery, and that the sicknesse was gone so far, ordained and commaunded, that euery one shoulde deuoutly prepare himselfe to prayer, and in remembraunce of Christ, caused his Image to be sette vp vpon a trée, aboute a Flight shotte from the Forte, amidst the Ice and Snowe, giuing all men to vnderstande, that on the Sonday following, seruice should be saide there, and, that whosoeuer coulde goe, sicke, or whole, should go thither in Procession, singing the seauen Psalmes of <HI>Dauid,</HI> with other Letanies, praying moste hartily, that it woulde please the said our Christ to haue compassion vpon vs. Seruice beyng done, and as well celebrated as we could, our Captaine there made a vowe, that if it woulde please God to giue him leaue to returne into <HI>Fraunce,</HI> he would goe on pilgrimage to our Lady of <HI>Rocquemado.</HI> That daye <HI>Phi∣lip Rougemont,</HI> borne in <HI>Amboisa,</HI> died, being two and twen∣ty yeares olde, and bicause the sicknes was to vs vnknowen, our Capitaine caused him to be ripped, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> if by any means possible we might know what it was, and so séeke means to saue and preserue the reste of the company: he was founde to haue his heart white, but rotten, &amp; more than a pottle of red w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er about it: his liuer was indifferent faire, but his lungs blacke and mortified, his bloud was altogither shrūke about the heart, so that when he was opened, great quantity of rot∣ten bloud issued out from aboute his heart: his milt toward the backe was somwhat perished, rough as if it had bin rub∣bed against a stone. Moreouer, bicause one of his thighs was very black without, it was opened, but within it was whole and sounde: that done, as wel as we could he was buryed. In suche sorte did the sicknes continue and encrease, that there were not aboue thrée found men in the ships, and none was
<PB N="66" REF="38"/>
able to go vnder hatches to draw drinke for himselfe, nor for his fellowes. Sometimes we were constrayned to burie some of the dead vnder the Snowe, bycause we were not able to digge any graues for them, the ground was so hard frosen, and we so weake. Besides this, we did greately feare, that the people of the Countrey would perceyue our weakenesse and miserie, whiche to hide, our Captayne, whome it pleased God alwayes to kéepe in health, woulde go out with two or thrée of the companye, some sicke, and some whole, whome when he saw out of the Fort, he would throw stones at them and chide them, faigning, that so soone as he came againe, he woulde beate them, and then with signes shew the people of the Countrey, that he caused all his men to worke and la∣boure in the Shippes, some in mending them, some in beating of chalke, some in one thing, and some in another, and that he woulde not haue them come foorthe, till their worke was done. And to make his tale séeme true and likely, he woulde make all his men whole and sound to make a great noyse, with knocking stickes, stones, hammers, and other things togither, at which time, we were so oppressed, and gréeued with that sicknesse, that we had lost all hope euer to sée <HI>France</HI> agayne, if God of his infinite goodnesse and mercie had not with his pitifull <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ye looked vpon vs, and reuealed a singular and excellent remedie against all diseases vnto vs, the best that euer was founde vpon earth, as héereafter shall fol∣lowe.</P>

That euening we went a land and found great store of Hares, of which we toke a great many, and therefore we called it <HI>The Ilande of Hares:</HI> in the night there arose a contrarie winde, with suche stormes and tempest, that we were constrayned to bende to the <HI>Iland of Filburdes</HI> againe, from whence we were come, bycause there was none other passage among the said Ilāds, and there we stayde till the one and twentie of that moneth, that faire weather and good winde came again: and then we sayled again, and that so prosperously, that we passed to <HI>Hon∣guedo,</HI> which passage vntil that time had not bene discouered: we caused our ships to course athwart <HI>Pratos Cape,</HI> which is the beginning of the Port of <HI>Cator:</HI> and bicause the wind was good and conuenient, we sayled all day and all night without staying, and the next day we came to the middle of <HI>Brions I∣lande,</HI> which we were not minded to do, to the end we might shorten our way. These two Ilands lie Northwest, &amp; South∣east, and are about fiftie leagues one from another. The said Iland is in latitude <HI>47.</HI> degrées and a halfe. Vpon Thursday being the <HI>26.</HI> of the moneth, and the feast of the Ascention of our Lord, we coasted ouer to go to a land and shallow of low sands, which are about eight leagues Sowthwest frō <HI>Brions Iland,</HI> on which are large Champaines, full of trées &amp; towns, and also an enclosed sea, of which neyther could we sée or per∣ceiue any gap, or any way to enter therein. On Friday fol∣lowing, being the <HI>27.</HI> of the moneth, bycause the winde did change on the cost, we came to <HI>Brions Iland</HI> againe, where we stayed till the beginning of Iune, and toward the South∣east of this Iland, we sawe a land, séeming vnto vs as an I∣lande, we coasted it about two leagues and a halfe, and by y<SUP>e</SUP> way we had notice of thrée other high Ilands, lying toward the Sandes, after we had known these things we retourned to the Cape of the saide land, whiche doeth diuide it selfe into two or thrée very high Capes: the waters ther are very déep,

&amp; the floud of the Sea runneth so swift, that it cannot possibly be swifter. That day we came to <HI>S. Laurence his Cape,</HI> whi∣che is <HI>45.</HI> degrées and halfe towards the South, wée named it <HI>S. Paules Cape,</HI> it is at <HI>47.</HI> degrées, and a quarter. The Sonday followyng, beyng the fourth of Iune and Whitson∣day, we hadde notice of the coaste lying East Southeast, distant from the new found land aboute <HI>22.</HI> leagues: and by∣cause the wind was against vs, we went to a Hauen, which we named <HI>S. Spiritus Porte,</HI> where wée stayed till Tuisdaye that we departed thence, sayling along that coaste vntill wée came to <HI>S. Peters Ilandes.</HI> We found along the saide coaste many very dangerous Ilands and Shelues, whych lye all in the waye East southeast, and Weast Northweast about <HI>23.</HI> leagues into the Sea. Whilest we were in the said <HI>S. Peters Ilands</HI> we met with many ships of <HI>France</HI> and of <HI>Britaine,</HI> we stayed there from S. Barnabas day, being the <HI>11.</HI> of the mo∣neth, vntil the <HI>16.</HI> that we departed thence and came to cape of <HI>Ras,</HI> and entred into a Porte called <HI>Rogaoso,</HI> where we toke in freshwater, and wood to passe the sea: there we lefte one of our boates. Then vpon Monday, beyng the <HI>19.</HI> of Iune, we went from that Porte, and wyth suche good and prospe∣rous weather we sailed along the Sea, in such sorte, that vp∣on the <HI>6.</HI> of Iune. <HI>1536.</HI> we came to the Porte of <HI>S. Malo,</HI> by the grace of God, to whom we pray, here ending oure Na∣uigation, that of his infinite mercie he will graunte vs hys grace and fauoure, and in the end, bring vs to the place of e∣uerlasting felicitie. <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>
