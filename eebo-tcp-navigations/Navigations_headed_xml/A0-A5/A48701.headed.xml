<HEAD><PB N="1" REF="7"/>A JOURNEY TO PARIS In the Year 1698.</HEAD>
<DIV1 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>Introduction to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>THis Tract was Written chiefly to satisfie my own Curiosity, and
to delight my self with the Memory of what I had seen. I busied my self
in a place where I had little to do, but to walk up and down; well knowing,
that the Character of a Stranger gave me free admittance to Men and Things. The
French Nation value themselves upon Civility, and build and dress mostly
for Figure; This Humour <PB N="2" REF="8"/>makes the Curiosity of Strangers
very easie and welcome to them.</P>
<P>But why do you trouble us with a Journey to <HI>Paris,</HI> a place
so well known to every body here? For very good Reason, to spare the
often telling my Tale at my return. But we know al∣ready all you can say, or
can read it in the <HI>Present State of France,</HI> and <HI>Description of
Paris;</HI> two Books to be had in every Shop in <HI>London;</HI> 'Tis right,
so you may; and I advise you not to neglect them, if you have a mind to
judge well of the Grandeur of the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and the immense
Greatness of the City of <HI>Paris.</HI> These were Spectacles I did
in∣deed put on, but I found they did not fit my sight, I had a mind to see
with∣out them; and in Matters of this Na∣ture, as vast Cities and vast
Palaces, I did not care much to use Microscopes or Mag∣nifying
Glasses.</P>
<P>But to content you, Reader, I pro∣mise you not to trouble you with
Cere∣monies either of State or Church, or Po∣liticks; for I entred willingly
into nei∣ther of them, but only, where they would make a part of the
Conversation, or my Walk was ordered me. You'l easily find by my
Observations, that I in∣cline rather to Nature than Dominion; 
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>and that I took more pleasure to see Monsieur
<HI>Breman</HI> in his white Wastcoat digging in the Royal Physick Garden,
and sowing his Couches, than Monsieur <HI>Saintot</HI> making room for an
Ambassador; and I found my self better disposed, and more apt to
learn the Names and Physi∣ognomy of a Hundred Plants, than of 5 or 6 Princes.
After all, I had much rather have walked a 100 paces under the meanest Hedge
in <HI>Languedoc,</HI> than any the finest Alley at <HI>Versailles</HI> or
<HI>St. Clou,</HI> so much I prefer fair Nature and a warm Sun, before the
most exquisite perfor∣mances of Art in a cold and barren Climate.</P>
<P>Another Reason, that I give you little or no trouble in telling
you Court Mat∣ters, is, that I was no more concerned in the Embassy, than
in the sailing of the Ship which carried me over: 'Tis enough for me, with
the rest of the People of <HI>England,</HI> to feel the good Ef∣fects of it,
and to pass away this Life in Peace and Quietness. 'Tis a happy turn for
us, when Kings are made Friends again. This was the end of this Embas∣sy,
and I hope it will last our days. My Lord Ambassador was infinitely
caressed by the King, his Ministers, and all the Princes. 'Tis certain
the French are the <PB N="4" REF="9"/>most Polite Nation in the World, and can
Praise and Court with a better Air than the rest of Mankind. However the
generality of the Kingdom were through great necessity well disposed to
receive the Peace: The Bigots and some Dis∣banded Officers might be heard
at our first going to grumble, but those also gave over, and we heard no
more of them when we came away; but to the Business.</P>
<P>I happily arrived at <HI>Paris</HI> after a te∣dious Journey in very
bad Weather; for we set out of <HI>London</HI> the 10th of <HI>December,</HI>
and I did not reach <HI>Paris</HI> till the first of <HI>January;</HI> for I
fell sick upon the Road, and stay'd 5 days at <HI>Bologne,</HI> be∣hind the
Company, till my Fever abat∣ed; yet notwithstanding so rude a Jour∣ney, I
recovered, and was perfectly cured of my Cough in 10 days; which was the
chiefest reason of my leaving <HI>London</HI> at that time of the year, and
never had the least return of it all the Winter, though it was as fierce
there as I ever felt it in <HI>England.</HI> This great be∣nefit of the
<HI>French</HI> Air I had experien∣ced 3 several times before, and had
there∣fore long'd for a passage many years; but the continuance of the War
was an insuperable Obstacle to my Desires. <PB N="5" REF="9"/>Therefore
the first opportunity which offered it self I readily embraced, which was
my Lord <HI>Portland</HI>'s Acceptance of my Attendance of him in his
Extraordi∣nary Embassie; who ordered me to go before with one of my good
Friends, who was sent to prepare Matters against his arrival.</P>
<P>Now that I might not wholly trust my Memory, in what I saw at
<HI>Paris,</HI> I set down my Thoughts under certain Heads.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>I. Of <HI>Paris</HI> in General.</HEAD>
<P>THough I had much spare time the 6 Months I staid in that City,
yet the rudeness of the Winter Season kept me in for some time. Again, I
believe I did not see the Tithe of what deserves to be seen, and well
considered; because for many things I wanted a relish, par∣ticularly for
Painting and Building; However I viewed the City in all its parts, and made the
round of it; took several prospects of it at a distance, which when well
thought on, I must needs confess it to be one of the most Beauti∣ful and
Magnificent in <HI>Europe,</HI> and in which a Traveller might find Novelties
enough f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r 6 Months for daily
Enter∣tainment, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> least in and
about this <PB N="6" REF="10"/>Noble City. To give therefore a strict and
general Idea of it, and not to enter far into the vain Disputes of the number
of Inhabitants, or its bigness, compared to <HI>London;</HI> sure I am, the
<HI>standing Croud</HI> was so great, when my Lord Ambassa∣dor made his
Entry, that our People were strartled at it, and were ready the next day to
give up the Question, had they not well considered the great Cu∣riosity
of the <HI>Parisians,</HI> who are much more delighted in fine Shews than the
People of <HI>London,</HI> and so were well near all got into the way of the
Cavalcade. One thing was an evident Argument of this Humour, that there were
some Hun∣dreds of Coaches of Persons of the best Quality, even some
Bishops and Peers which I saw, which had placed them∣selves in a file to
line the Streets, and had had the patience to have so remained for some
hours.</P>
<P>'Tis also most certain, that for the quantity of Ground
possessed by the Common People, this City is much more populous than
any part of <HI>London;</HI> here are from 4 to 5 and to 10 Menages, or
distinct Families in many Houses; but this is only to be understood of
certain places of Trade. This difference betwixt the two Cities also is true,
that here the <PB N="7" REF="10"/>Palaces and Convents have eat up the Peoples
Dwellings, and crouded them excessively together, and possessed
them∣selves of far the greatest part of the Ground; whereas in
<HI>London</HI> the con∣trary may be observed, that the People have
destroyed the Palaces, and placed themselves upon the Foundations of them,
and forced the Nobility to live in Squares or Streets in a sort of
Commu∣nity; but this they have done very ho∣nestly, having fairly purchased
them.</P>
<P>The Views also which it gives upon the River are admirable; that
of the <HI>Pont-neuf</HI> downwards to the <HI>Tuilleries,</HI> or upwards from
the <HI>Pont-Royal;</HI> and in some other places, as from <HI>Pont St.
Ber∣nard,</HI> the <HI>Greve, &amp;c.</HI> The River <HI>Seine</HI> which
passes through the midst of the City, is all nobly Bank'd or Keyed with
large Freestone; and incloses in the heart of the City two Islands, which
causes many fine Bridges to be built to pass over them. One of these
Islands called <HI>l'Isle de Palais</HI> was all <HI>Paris</HI> for some
Ages.</P>
<P>The Houses are built of hewen Stone intirely, or whited over with
Plaister: some indeed in the beginning of this Age are of Brick with
Freestone, as the <HI>Place-Royal, Place-Dauphin, &amp;c.</HI> but that is 
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>wholly left off now; and the white Plaister is in some
few places only co∣loured after the fashion of Brick, as part of the Abbay of
<HI>St. Germain.</HI> The Houses every where are high and stately; The
Churches numerous, but not very big; The Towers and Steeples but few in
proportion to the Churches, yet that noble way of Steeple, the <HI>Domes</HI>
or <HI>Cu∣polas,</HI> have a marvellous effect in pro∣spect; though they are
not many, as that of <HI>Val de Grace, des Invalides, Col∣lege Mazarin, De
l'Assumption,</HI> the <HI>Grand-Jesuits, La Sorbonne,</HI> and some
few o∣thers.</P>
<P>All the Houses of Persons of Distin∣ction are built with
<HI>Port-cochers,</HI> that is, wide Gates to drive in a Coach, and
consequently have Courts within; and mostly <HI>Remises</HI> to set
them up. There are reckoned above 700 of these great Gates; and very many of
these are af∣ter the most noble Patterns of ancient Architecture.</P>
<P>The lower Windows of all Houses are Grated with strong Bars of
Iron; which must be a vast Expence.</P>
<P>As the Houses are magnificent without, so the Finishing within
side and Furni∣ture answer in Riches and Neatness; as Hangings of rich
Tapestry, raised with <PB N="9" REF="11"/>Gold and Silver Threads, Crimson
Da∣mask and Velvet Beds or of Gold and Silver Tissue. <HI>Cabinets</HI> and
<HI>Bureaus,</HI> of Ivory inlaid with Tortoishell, and Gold and Silver
Plates in a 100 different manners: Branches and Candlesticks of Crystal:
but above all most rare Pictures. The Gild∣ings, Carvings and Paintings of
the Roof are admirable.</P>
<P>These things are in this City and the Country about to such a
variety and ex∣cess, that you can come into no private House of any Man of
Substance, but you see something of them; and they are observed
frequently to ruine themselves in these Expences. Every one, that has any
thing to spare, covets to have some good Picture or Sculpture of the best
Artist; The like in the Ornaments of their Gardens, so that it is
incredible what pleasure that vast quantity of fine things give the Curious
Stranger. Here as soon as ever a Man gets any thing by Fortune or
Inheritance, he lays it out in some such way as now named.</P>
<P>Yet after all many Utensils and Con∣veniencies of Life are wanting
here, which we in <HI>England</HI> have: This makes me remember what Monsieur
<HI>Justell,</HI> a <HI>Parisian</HI> formerly, told me here, that he had
made a Catalogue of near Threescore <PB N="10" REF="12"/>Things of this Nature
which they wanted in <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>The Pavement of the Streets is all of square Stone, of about 8 or
10 Inches thick; that is, as deep in the ground as they are broad at top; The
Gutters shal∣low, and laid round without edges, which makes the Coaches glide
easily over them.</P>
<P>However, it must needs be said, the Streets are very narrow, and
the Passen∣gers a-foot no ways secured from the hur∣ry and danger of
Coaches, which always pass the Streets with an air of haste; and a full
trot upon broad flat Stones, betwixt high and large resounding Houses,
makes a sort of Musick which should seem very agreeable to the
<HI>Parisians.</HI></P>
<P>The Royal Palaces are surprisingly stately; as the
<HI>Louvre</HI> and <HI>Tuilliries, Pa∣lais Luxembourg, Palais Royal.</HI></P>
<P>The Convents are great, and numerous, and well built; as <HI>Val de
Grace, St. Ger∣mains, St. Victor, St. Genevieve,</HI> the <HI>Grand Jesuits,
&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Squares are few in <HI>Paris,</HI> but ve∣ry beautiful; as the
<HI>Place Royal, Place Victoir, Place Dauphine,</HI> none of the largest,
except the <HI>Place Vendosme,</HI> not yet fi∣nish'd.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12"/>The Gardens within the Walls, open to the
publick, are vastly great, and very beautiful; as the <HI>Tuilleries, Palais
Royal, Luxembourg,</HI> the <HI>Royal Physick Garden,</HI> of the
<HI>Arsenal,</HI> and many belonging to Con∣vents, the <HI>Carthusians,
Celestins, St. Victor, St. Genevieve, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But that which makes the dwelling in this City very diverting for
People of Quality, is the facility of going out with their Coaches into the
Fields, on every side; it lying round, and the Avenues to it so well paved;
and the Places of Airing so clean, open, or shady, as you please, or the
Season of the year, and time of the day requires: As the <HI>Cour de la
Reyne, Bois de Bologne, Bois de Vin∣cennes, les Sables de Vaugerarde,
&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But to descend to a more particular Review of this great City, I
think it not amiss to speak first of the Streets and publick Places, and
what may be seen in them: Next of the Houses of Note; and what
Curiosities of Nature or Art, also of Men and Libraries, I met with: Next,
of their Diet and Recreations: Next of the Gardens, and their Furniture and
Ornaments: Of the Air and Health. We shall conclude the whole with the
present State of Physic and Pharmacy here.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="section">
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Coaches.</NOTE>To begin with the Coaches, which
are very numerous here and very fine in Gilding: But there are but few, and
those only of the great Nobility, which are large, and have two Seats or
Funds. But what they want in the largeness, beauty, and neatness of ours in
<HI>London,</HI> they have infinitely in the easiness of Carriage, and the
ready turning in the narrowest Streets. For this purpose, they are all
Crane-Neckt, and the Wheels be∣fore very low, not above two foot and a half
Diameter; which makes them ea∣sie to get into, and brings down the Coach-Box
low, that you have a much better prospect out of the foremost Glass; our
high seated Coachmen being ever in the point of view. Again, They are most,
even Fiacres or Hackneys, hung with <HI>Double Springs,</HI> at the four
Corners, which insensibly breaks all Jolts. This I never was so
sensible off, as after having pra∣ctised the <HI>Paris</HI> Coaches for
four months, I once rid in the easiest Chariot of my Lords, which came from
<HI>England;</HI> but not a Jolt but what affected a Man; so as to be tired
more in one hour in that, than in six in these.</P>
<P>Besides the great number of Coaches of the Gentry, here are
Coaches <HI>de Re∣mise,</HI> <PB N="13" REF="13"/>by the month; which are very
well Guilt, neat Harness, and good Horses: And these all Strangers Hire
by the Day or Month, at about Three Crowns Eng∣lish a Day. 'Tis this sort
that spoils the Hackneys and Chairs, which here are the most nasty and
miserable Voiture that can be; and yet near as dear again as in
<HI>London,</HI> and but very few of them neither.</P>
<P>Yet there is one more in this City, which I was willing to omit, as
thinking it at first fight Scandalous, and a very Jest; it being a wretched
Business in so Magnificent a City; and that is, the <HI>Vinegrette,</HI>
a Coach on Two Wheels, dragg'd by a Man, and push'd behind by a Woman or Boy,
or both.</P>
<P>Besides those, for quick Travelling there are great number of
<HI>Post-Chaises</HI> for a single Person; and <HI>Roullions</HI> for
two Persons: These are on two Wheels only, and have each their Double
Springs to make them very easie; they run very swiftly: both the Horses
pull; but one only is in the Thilles. The Coach-man mounts the
<HI>Roullion;</HI> but for the <HI>Chaise,</HI> he only mounts the side
Horse only. I think neither of these are in use in <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> but
might be introduced to good purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="14"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">Recreati∣ons and
Walks.</NOTE>As for their <HI>Recreations and Walks,</HI> there are no People
more fond of coming to∣gether, to see and to be seen. This Conversation
without doubt takes up a great part of their time: And for this purpose, the
<HI>Cour de la Reyne</HI> is frequen∣ted by all People of Quality. It is a
Treble Walk of Trees of a great length, near the River side, the middle Walk
ha∣ving above double the breadth to the two side ones; and will hold eight
files of Coaches, and in the middle a great open Circle to turn, with fine
Gates at both ends. Those that would have better and freer Air, go further,
and drive into the <HI>Bois de Bologne,</HI> others out of other Parts of the
Town to <HI>Bois de Vincennes,</HI> scarce any side amiss. In like manner
these Persons light and Walk in the <HI>Tuilleries, Luxembourg,</HI> and
other Gardens, belong∣ing to the Crown and Princes, (all which are very
spacious) and are made conve∣nient, with <HI>many Seats</HI> for the
Enter∣tainment of all People; the Lacquies and Mob excepted; but of this more
here∣after.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bishops.</NOTE>No sort of People make a
better figure in the Town than the <HI>Bishops,</HI> who have very splendid
Equipages, and variety of fine Liveries, being most of them Men of 
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>great Families, and preferred as such, Learning not being
so necessary a Quali∣fication for those Dignities, as with us; tho'
there are some of them very De∣serving and Learned Men. I say, They are
most Noblemen, or the younger Sons of the best Families. This indeed, is
for the Honour of the Church; but whether it be for the good of Learning and
Piety is doubtful. They may be Patrons, but there are but few Examples of
Erudition among them. 'Tis to be wisht, that they exceeded others in Merit,
as they do in Birth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Abbots.</NOTE>The <HI>Abbots</HI> here are
numerous, from all Parts of the Kingdom. They make a considerable figure, as
being a gentile sort of Clergy, and the most Learned; at least were so
from the time of Cardi∣nal <HI>Richlieu,</HI> who preferred Men of the
greatest Learning and Parts to these Posts; and that very frankly, and
with∣out their knowing it before-hand, much less solliciting him for it. He
took a sure way, peculiar to himself, to enquire out privately Men of
Desert, and took his own time to prefer them. This filled the Kingdom of
<HI>France</HI> with learned Men, and gave great Encouragement to Study;
whereof <HI>France</HI> yet has some feeling.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">Signs in the
Streets.</NOTE>'Tis pretty to observe, how the King Disciplines this great
City, by small in∣stances of Obedience. He caused them to take down all
their Signs at once, and not to advance them above a foot or two from the Wall,
nor to exceed such a small measure of square; which was readily done:
So that the Signs obscure not the Streets at all, and make little or no
figure, as tho' there were none; being placed very high and little.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hostels.</NOTE>There are great number of
<HI>Hostels</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> by which word is meant <HI>Publick
Inns,</HI> where Lodgings are Lett; and also the Noblemen and Gentlemens
Houses are so called, mostly with Titles over the Gate in Letters of Gold
on a Black Mar∣ble. This seems, as it were to denote, that they came at
first to <HI>Paris</HI> as Stran∣gers only, and Inn'd publickly; but at
length built them Inns or Houses of their own. 'Tis certain, a great and
wealthy City cannot be without People of Qua∣lity; nor such a Court as that
of <HI>France</HI> without the daily Inspection of what such People do. But
whether the Country can spare them or not, I question. The People of
<HI>England</HI> seem to have less Man∣ners and less Religion, where the
Gentry <PB N="17" REF="15"/>have left them wholly to themselves; and the Taxes
are raised with more dif∣ficulty, inequality, and injustice, than when the
Landlords live upon the Des∣maines.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The City rebuilt.</NOTE>It may very well he, that
<HI>Paris</HI> is in a manner a new City within this 40 years. 'Tis certain
since this King came to the Crown, 'tis so much altered for the better,
that 'tis quite another thing; and if it be true what the Workmen told me, that
a common House built of Rough Stone and Plaistered over, would not last
above 25 years, the greatest part of the City has been lately rebuilt. In
this Age certainly most of the great Ho∣stels are built or re-edified; in
like man∣ner the Convents, the Bridges and Churches, the Gates of the City; add
the great alteration of the Streets, the Keyes upon the River, the Pavements;
all these have had great additions, or are quite new.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Boats upon the River.</NOTE>In the River
amongst the Bridges, both above and below, are a vast number of Boats, of
Wood, Hay, Charcoal, Corn and Wine, and other Commodities. But when a sudden
Thaw comes, they are often in danger of being split and crusht to pieces 
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>upon the Bridges; which also are some∣times ruined by
them. There have been great Losses to the Owners of such Boats and
Goods.</P>
<P>It has been proposed to dig near the City a large <HI>Basin</HI>
for a Winter Har∣bour; but this has not had the face of Profit to the
Government; so they are still left to execute their own Project. There are
no Laws or Projects so effectu∣al here, as what bring Profit to the
Go∣vernment. Farming is admirably well understood here.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lawyers.</NOTE>Amongst the Living Objects to be
seen in the Streets of <HI>Paris,</HI> the Counsellors and Chief Officers
of the Courts of Ju∣stice make a great Figure; They and their Wives have
their Trains carried up; so there are abundance to be seen walking about
the Streets in this manner. 'Tis for this that places of that nature sell
so well. A Man that has a right to qualifie a Wife with this Honour, shall
command a Fortune; and the carrying a great Vel∣vet Cushion to Church is
such another business. The Place of a Lawyer is va∣lued a Third part
dearer for this.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monks.</NOTE>Here are also daily to be seen
in the Streets great variety of <HI>Monks,</HI> in strange 
<PB N="19" REF="16"/>unusual Habits to us <HI>Englishmen:</HI> These make
an odd Figure, and furnish well a Picture. I cannot but pity the mistaken
Zeal of these poor Men; that put them∣selves into Religion, as they call
it, and renounce the World, and give them∣selves most severe Rules of
Living and Diet; some of the Orders are decently enough Cloathed, as the
Jesuits, the Fa∣thers of the Oratory, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but most are very
particular and obsolete in their Dress, as being the Rustic Habit of old
times, without Linnen, or Ornaments of the present Age.</P>
<P>As to their Meager Diet, it is much against Nature, and the
improved Diet of Mankind. The <HI>Mosaic</HI> Law provided much better for
<HI>Jews,</HI> a chosen People; That was instituted for cleanliness and
health. Now for the Christian Law, though it commands Humility and Pa∣tience
under Sufferings, and Mortificati∣on and Abstinence from Sinful Lusts and
Pleasures; yet by no means a distinct Food, but liberty to eat any thing
what∣soever, much less nastiness; and the Pa∣pists themselves in
other things are of this mind; for their Churches are clean, pompously
adorned and perfumed. 'Tis enough, if we chance to suffer Persecu∣tion, to
endure it with Patience, and all <PB N="20" REF="17"/>the miserable
Circumstances that attend it; but wantonly to persecute our selves, is to
do violence to Christianity, and to put our selves in a worse state
than the <HI>Jews</HI> were; for to choose the worst of Food, which is
sowre Herbs and Fish, and such like Trash, and to lie worse al∣ways
rough, in course and nasty Wool∣len Frocks upon Boards; To go Bare∣foot in
a cold Country, to deny them∣selves the Comforts of this Life, and the
Conversation of Men; This, I say, is to hazard our Healths, to renounce the
greatest Blessings of this Life, and in a manner to destroy our
selves. These Men, I say, cannot but be in the main Chagrin, and
therefore as they are out of humour with the World, so they must in time be
weary of such sla∣vish and fruitless Devotion, which is not attended
with an active Life.</P>
<P>The great multitude of <HI>poor</HI> Wretches in all parts of this
City is such, that a Man in a Coach, a-foot, in the Shop, is not able to do
any business for the num∣bers and importunities of Beggars; and to hear
their Miseries is very lamentable; and if you give to one, you immediately
bring a whole swarm upon you. These, I say, are true Monks, if you will,
of God Almighties making, offering you <PB N="21" REF="17"/>their Prayers for a
Farthing, that find the evil of the day sufficient for the day, and that the
Miseries of this Life are not to be courted, or made a mock of; These
Worship much against their will all rich Men, and make Saints of the rest
of Mankind for a Morsel of Bread.</P>
<P>But let these Men alone with their mistaken Zeal; it is
certainly God's good Providence which orders all things in this World. And the
Flesh Eaters will ever defend themselves, if not beat the Lenten Men; good
and wholsome Food, and plenty of it, gives Men naturally great Courage.
Again, a Nation will sooner be Peopled by the free Marriage of all sorts of
People, than by the additio∣nal stealth of a few starved Monks,
sup∣posing them at any time to break their Vow. This limiting of Marriage
to a certain People only is a deduction and an abatement of Mankind, not less
in a Pa∣pist Country, than a constant War. A∣gain, this lessens also
the number of God's Worshippers, instead of multiply∣ing them as the Stars
in the Firmament, or the Sand upon the Sea Shoar; These Men wilfully cut off
their Posterity, and reduce Gods Congregation for the fu∣ture.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="18"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">Publick Cries.</NOTE>There is
very little noise in this City of <HI>Publick Cries</HI> of things to be
sold, or any Disturbance from Pamphlets and Hawkers. One thing I wondered
at, that I heard of nothing lost, nor any publick Advertisements, till I
was shewed Printed Papers upon the Corners of Streets, wherein were in great
Letters, <HI>Ʋn, Deux, Cinq, Dix jus{que} a Cinquante Louisse a
gagner,</HI> that is, from One to Fifty Louises to be got; and then
underneath an account of what was lost. This sure is a good and quiet way;
for by this means without noise you often find your Goods again; every body
that has found them repair∣ing in a day or two to such places. The
<HI>Gazettes</HI> come out but once a week, and but few People buy them.</P>
<P>'Tis difficult and dangerous to vend a Libel here. While we were in
Town, a certain Person gave a Bundle of them to a blind Man, a Beggar of the
Hospital of the <HI>Quincevint,</HI> telling him he might get five pence for
every penny; he went to <HI>Nostredame,</HI> and cried them up in the Service
time, <HI>La vie &amp; Miracles de Eves{que} de Reims.</HI> This was a
Trick that was play'd the Archbishop, as it was thought, by the Jesuits,
with whom he has had a great Contest about <HI>Molinas</HI> the <HI>Spanish
J. Doctrines.</HI> The Libel went off <PB N="23" REF="18"/>at any Rate, when the
first Buyers had read the Title further, and found they were against the
present Archbishop, Duke and first Peer of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Streets Lighted.</NOTE>The Streets are lighted
alike all the Winter long, as well when the Moon shines, as at other times of
the Month; which I remember the rather, because of the impertinent usage of
our People at <HI>London,</HI> to take away the Lights for half of the Month,
as though the Moon was certain to shine and light the Streets, and that there
could be no Cloudy Weather in Winter. The Lanthorns here hang down in the very
middle of all the Streets, about 20 paces distance, and 20 foot high. They
are made of a square of Glass about 2 foot deep, covered with a broad Plate
of Iron; and the Rope that lets them down, is secured and lockt up in an Iron
Funnel and little Trunk fast∣ned into the Wall of the House. These
Lanthorns have Candles of 4 in the pound in them, which last burning till
after mid∣night.</P>
<P>As to these Lights, if any Man break them, he is forthwith sent
to the Gallies; and there were 3 young Gentlemen of good Families, who were in
Prison for having done it in a Frolick, and could <PB N="24" REF="19"/>not be
released thence in some Months; and that not without the diligent
Appli∣cation of good Friends at Court.</P>
<P>The Lights at <HI>Paris</HI> for 5 Months in the year only, cost
near 50000<HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR> Sterling.</HI> This way of Lighting the Streets
is in use also in some other Cities in <HI>France.</HI> The King is
said to have raised a large Tax by it. In the Preface to the Tax it is
said, That considering the great danger his Sub∣jects were in, in Walking
the Streets in the Dark, from Thieves, and the breaking their Necks by falls,
he for such a Sum of Money did grant this Priviledge, that they might hang
out Lanthorns in this manner.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Streets clean.</NOTE>I have said, that the
Avenues to the City, and all the Streets, are paved with a very hard <HI>Sand
Stone,</HI> about 8 Inches square; so they have a great care to keep them
clean; in Winter, for Example, upon the melting of the Ice, by a heavy drag
with a Horse, which makes a quick riddance and cleaning the Gutters; so
that in a days time all parts of the Town are to admiration clean and neat
again to walk on.</P>
<P>I could heartily wish their <HI>Summer</HI> cleanliness was as
great; it is certainly as necessary to keep so populous a City 
<PB N="25" REF="19"/>sweet; but I know no Machine sufficient, but what would
empty it of the People too; all the Threats and Inscriptions up∣on Walls are
to little purpose. The Dust in <HI>London</HI> in Summer is oftentimes, if
a Wind blow, very troublesome, if not intolerable; in <HI>Paris</HI> there is
much less of it, and the reason is, the flat Stones require little Sand to
set them fast, where∣as our small Pebles, not coming together, require a
vast quantity to lay them fast in Paving.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Statues Equestres.</HI></NOTE>But from the
People in the Streets, to the dead Ornaments there: There are an infinite
number of Busto's of the Grand Monarque every where put up by the Common
People; but the Noble <HI>Statues</HI> are but few, considering the
Obsequious Humour and Capacity of the People to perform.</P>
<P>That in the <HI>Place-Victoire</HI> is a-foot in Brass all over
gilt; with <HI>Victoire;</HI> that is, a vast Winged Woman close behind his
Back, holding forth a Laurel Crown over the Kings Head, with one Foot up∣on a
Globe. There are great exceptions taken at the Gilding by Artists; and,
indeed the shining seems to spoil the Fea∣tures, and give I know not what
confu∣sion; it had better have been all of Gold <PB N="26" REF="20"/>brassed over; which would have given its true Lights and Shaddows,
and suf∣fered the Eye to judge of the proportions. But that which I like not
in this, is the great Woman perpetually at the Kings Back; which is a sort of
Embarras, and instead of giving Victory, seems to tire him with her
Company. The <HI>Roman Victorie</HI> was a little Puppit in the Empe∣rours
Hand, which he could dispose of at pleasure; This Woman is enough to give
a Man a Surfeit.</P>
<P>The other are <HI>Statuae Equestres,</HI> of 3 of the last Kings
of <HI>France,</HI> in Brass a Horseback.</P>
<P>That on the <HI>Pont-neuf</HI> is of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth in
his Armour bare-headed, and Habited as the Mode of that time was.</P>
<P>The other of <HI>Lewis</HI> the Thirteenth in the
<HI>Place-Royal,</HI> Armed also after the Mode of the Age, and his Plume of
Fea∣thers on his Headpiece.</P>
<P>The 3d is of this present King <HI>Louis</HI> the Fourteenth, and
designed for the <HI>Place Vendosme.</HI> This Colossus of Brass is
yet in the very place where it was cast; it is surprisingly great, being
22 foot high, the Foot of the King 26 inches in length, and all the proportions
of him and the Horse suitable. There was 100000 pound weight of Mettal
melted, <PB N="27" REF="20"/>but it took not up above 80000 pounds; it was all
cast at once, Horse and Man. Mons. <HI>Girardon</HI> told me, he wrought
di∣ligently, and with almost daily applica∣tion at the Model 8 years, and
there were two years more spent in the Mould∣ing, and Furnaces, and Casting
of it. The King is in the Habit of a <HI>Roman</HI> Em∣peror, without Stirrups
or Saddle, and on his Head a French large Periwig <HI>A-la∣mode.</HI> Whence
this great Liberty of Sculpture arises, I am much to seek.</P>
<P>'Tis true, that in building precisely to follow the ancient manner
and simplici∣ty is very commendable, because all those Orders were
founded upon good Prin∣ciples in Mathematicks; but the Cloath∣ing of an
Emperor, was no more, than the weak fancy of the People. For <HI>Louis le
Grand</HI> to be thus dressed up at the head of his Army now a-days would
be very Comical. What need other Em∣blems, when Truth may be had; as though the
present Age need be ashamed of their Modes, or that the <HI>Statua
E∣questris</HI> of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, or <HI>Louis</HI> the
Thirteenth, were the less to be valued for being done in the true Dress of
their times. It seems to me to be the effect of Mistaken Flattery, but if
regarded only as a Piece of meer Art, it is me-thinks <PB N="28" REF="21"/>very
unbecoming, and has no Graceful Air with it.</P>
<P>I remember I was at the <HI>Levee</HI> of King <HI>Charles</HI> the
Second, when 3 Models were brought him, to choose one of, in order to make
his Statue for the Court at <HI>Wind∣sor;</HI> he chose the <HI>Roman</HI>
Emperours Dress, and caused it also to be executed in that other erected
for him in the <HI>Old Exchange</HI> in <HI>London.</HI> The like is of K.
<HI>J.</HI> in <HI>White∣hall,</HI> at <HI>Chelsey-Colledge,</HI> our
<HI>Invalides.</HI> Now I appeal to all Mankind, whether in re∣presenting a
living Prince now a-days these naked Arms and Legs are decent, and whether
there is not a <HI>barbarity</HI> very displeasing in it. The Father of
these two Kings, <HI>Charles</HI> the First, was the Prince of this Age of
the best Relish, and of a sound Judgment, particularly in Painting,
Sculpture, Architecture by Sea and Land, witness the vast Sum of Money he
be∣stowed upon <HI>Rubens</HI> and his Disciple <HI>Vandyke.</HI> Also
the great Esteem he had for the incomparable <HI>Inigo Jones,</HI> who was
the first <HI>Englishman</HI> in this Age that understood Building. I
heard <HI>Auzout</HI> say, when he had viewed the
<HI>Banquetting-House</HI> at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> that it was preferable to
all the Buildings on this side the <HI>Alpes;</HI> and I ought to believe
him, he having studied <HI>Vitruvius</HI> more than 40 years to∣gether 
<PB N="29" REF="21"/>mostly upon the place and at <HI>Rome.</HI> Also the
Ship the <HI>Sovereign,</HI> which was truly the Noblest floating Castle
that ever swam the Sea. Yet after all this, that King had a <HI>Statua
Equestris</HI> of himself erected, now at <HI>Charingcross,</HI> cast
in the full Habit of his own time, and which I think may com∣pare with the
best of that sort at <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="section">
<P>I should beg Leave in the next place to visit the Palaces and
Men of Letters and Conversation; but I must take no∣tice first of the
vast Expences that are here in Iron Balastrades, as in the
<HI>Place-Royal,</HI> which Square is compassed about with one of 10 foot
high; Of this sort and better there are infinite every where in
<HI>Paris;</HI> which gives indeed a full view of the beauty of their Gardens
and Courts.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P. Maza∣rin.</HI></NOTE>First, therefore, I
saw the <HI>Palais Mazarin,</HI> in which are many good Pictures, but the Low
Gallery is furnisht with a great Col∣lection of Ancient <HI>Greek</HI> and
<HI>Roman</HI> Sta∣tues, and is what I most took notice of; They were most
brought from <HI>Rome</HI> by the <HI>Cardinal.</HI> Those which are
<HI>Togatae</HI> and Cloathed, are as they were found; but such as were made
<HI>Nudae,</HI> are miserably disguised by the fond Humour of the Duke
<HI>de Mazarin,</HI> who in a hot Fit of De∣votion <PB N="30" REF="22"/>caused
them to be castrated and mangled, and then frocked them by a sad Hand with
I know not what Plaister of <HI>Paris,</HI> which makes them very
ridi∣culous. <HI>Cicero</HI> somewhere tells us, that some of the ancient
Wise Men thought there was nothing naturally obscene, but that every thing
might be called by its own Name; but our <HI>Celsus</HI> is of another mind,
and begs Pardon, being a <HI>Roman,</HI> that he writ of those Matters in his
own Tongue. 'Tis certain upon our Subject, the Duke should not have
furnisht his Cabinet and Gallery with Naked Pictures, but with the
<HI>Togatae</HI> only; or if it had once pleased him to do otherwise, he
should not have Cloathed them; which was at best but a vain Ostentation
of his Chastity, and betrayed his ignorance and dislike of good things;
that is, spoils and hides the noble Art of the Sculpture, for which only they
are valuable.</P>
<P>But why should Nudity be so offensive, since a very great
part of the World yet defies Cloaths, and ever did so; and the parts they do
most affect to cover, is from a certain necessity only.</P>
<P>'Tis plain by these and many other E∣legant Statues I saw at
<HI>Versailles,</HI> most of which were taken out hence, that the
<HI>Roman</HI> Cloathing was the most simple <PB N="31" REF="22"/>thing
imaginable, and that a <HI>Roman</HI> was as soon undressed as I can put
off my Gloves and Shoes. The Men and Wo∣men went drest much alike; As for the
fashion of the <HI>Roman</HI> Habit, it is evident by these ancient
Statues, (which <HI>Oct. Ferrarius</HI> has well and reasonably fol∣lowed in
explicating the several Garments of the Ancients) that the <HI>Tunica</HI> or
Shirt was without a Collar or Sleeves, and girt high up under the Breasts;
also, that the <HI>Toga</HI> or <HI>Gown</HI> was a wide and long Garment
open at both ends, and let down over the Head, and supported by the Left Hand
thrust under the Skirts of it, whilst the top of it rested upon the left
Shoulder; The Right Hand and Arm was naked, and above the Gown, so that the
Gown was ungirt and always loose. Now for the purpose, when a
<HI>Roman</HI> made himself naked for the Bath, (as he daily did just
before eating) he had no∣thing to do but to draw up his Left Hand, and the Gown
fell down at his Feet; and at the same time to loose the Girdle of the
Tunica, and to draw up both his Arms from under the Tunica, and that also
fell at his Feet.</P>
<P>In the first Ages of the Commonwealth they wore a Toga or Gown
only, after∣wards they put on next the Skin a Tunica <PB N="32" REF="23"/>or
Shirt, and never added more in the very Splendour and Luxury of the Em∣pire;
all other Matters of Cloathing, of what nature soever, have been invented
since.</P>
<P>I much admired, that in the great numbers of ancient Statues to be
seen in and about <HI>Paris,</HI> I could never meet any one but what was
Cloathed with a <HI>Toga pura,</HI> and no representation of a Bullated
one.</P>
<P>This <HI>Toga</HI> and <HI>Tunica</HI> both were made of fine white
Wooll, or Flannel: They had not a Rag of Linnen about them. This Flannel, I
say, was very fine, for the folds are small, and it falls into them
easily; and seems to be very light, by the handling of it, to raise it by
the Finger and Thumb only, as is the Air of some of the Statues, and the
whole Garment to be suspended by the left Shoulder: Upon the least
straining of it, the Breasts and Nipples are visible through it; also
the proportions of the Thighs.</P>
<P>This wearing all Woollen in a hot Country, brought on the use and
necessity of frequent Bathing, otherwise they could never have kept
themselves sweet and clean; and the necessity of Bathing kept them to
this sort of loose Garment; and much Bathing brought in Oils, and Oils
Per∣fumes infused in them.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="23"/>But in my mind a fair Linnen Shirt every day is
as great a preservative to Neat∣ness and Cleaness of the Skin and Health,
as daily Bathing was to the <HI>Romans.</HI> 'Tis certain, had they not used
either simple Oils of Olives, sometimes unripe and old, for the
astringency, and sometimes ripe and perfumed, the warm Water must have
much decayed Nature, and made the Skin intolerable tender and wrinkled. The
Naked <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Blacks</HI> secure their Skins by Oils at this
day from all the in∣juries of the Weather, both from Heat and Cold.</P>
<P>But the best Rule of Health and long Life is to do little to our
selves: People are not aware what inconveniencies they bring upon
themselves by custom, how they will plead for things long used, and make
that pleasant which is very destru∣ctive to their Healths; as in the Case
of Cloathing, Tobacco, Strong Waters, Steel Remedies, the Drinking Mineral
Waters, Bathing, Tea, Coffee, Chocolate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>One little Statue I took more particular notice of, for the elegance
of the Sculp∣ture, and the humour of the Dress; it stood upon a Table; it
was the Figure of a Sybil: The Face of the old Woman was cut very deep into the
Stone, within the Quoifure, like a Hood pulled over the <PB N="34" REF="24"/>Forehead, a very Emblem of an Oracle, which is hid, dark, and
ambiguous, as the Woman her self, who would have nei∣ther her Face seen,
nor her Saying easily understood; that is, she is as it were ashamed of
her Cheat.</P>
<P>What was the fancy of the Men of the first Ages to make <HI>Old
Women Prophetesses,</HI> to utter Oracles, and to interpret the Will of the
Gods by the eating of Ani∣mals. To make them <HI>Sagae</HI> and
<HI>Veneficae</HI> is reasonable enough; for old Age makes all People
spiteful, but more the weaker Sex; To Poison and Bewitch are the se∣cret
Revenges of Impotent People.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> were impatient of the Com∣pany of Women in their
Religious Rites, lest they should contaminate and spoil all their
Devotion. The <HI>Romans</HI> on the con∣trary thought Religion became Women
better than Men, for besides the general parts they had in common with the
Men in Adoration of their Gods, they had also peculiar ones, where the Men
were not concerned. <HI>Tully</HI> bids his Wife suppli∣cate the Gods for
him; for he tells her, he thought they would be kinder to her than him. Upon
some such Principle, probably, their Prophetesses were in esteem.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="24"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">M. <HI>Vivi∣ers.</HI></NOTE>I
saw the Apartment of Monsieur <HI>Vi∣viers</HI> in the Arsenal; it

<P>That which pleased me most, amongst the Paintings, were the
Pieces of <HI>Ram∣bramts,</HI> that incomparable <HI>Dutch</HI> Painter.</P>
<P>A Girl with a Cage in one Hand, and looking up after the Bird that
had got out, and was flying away over her Head: She had Fright, Amazement, and
Sorrow in her Looks. The other is an unlucky Lad leaning upon a Table, and
looking with Mischief in his Eyes, or that he watcht to do some unhappy
turn. The 3d is a young Gentleman in a Fur Cap <HI>en dishabille,</HI> after
his wonted manner. The two first are the most natural Thoughts and Dress
that can be; but nothing cer∣tainly ever came near his colouring for Flesh
and Garments: This part he studied passionately all his Life, and was
ever try∣ing Experiments about it; and with what success, these and many

<P><PB N="36" REF="25"/>These Three Pictures of <HI>Rambrant</HI> are
all of young People, and are finisht with all the art and perfection of

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">M. <HI>le No∣stre.</HI></NOTE>Monsieur <HI>le
Nostre</HI>'s Cabinet, or Rooms wherein he keeps his fine things, the
Controller of the Kings Gardens, at the side of the <HI>Tuilleries,</HI> was
worth seeing. He is a very ingenious old Gentleman, and the Ordinance and
Design of most of the Royal and great Gardens in and about <HI>Paris</HI>
are of his Invention, and he has lived to see them in perfection. This
Gentleman is 89 years old, and quick and lively. He Entertained me very
Civilly. There were in the 3 Appartments, into which it is divided, (the
uppermost of which is an Octogon Room with a <HI>Dome</HI>) a great
Collection of choice Pictures, Porcellans, some of which were <HI>Jars</HI>
of a most exraordinary size; some old <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Heads and

richly bound up in Books; but he had lately made a Draught of his best
Pictures, <PB N="37" REF="25"/>to the value of 50000 Crowns, and had presented
them to the King at <HI>Versailles.</HI> There was not any thing of Natural
Hi∣story in all his Cabinet.</P>
<P>I was several times with him, and once he carried me into an upper
Closet, where he had a great Collection of Me∣dals in 4 Cabinets, most
modern; a∣mongst them there were 4 large Drawers, 3 of which were the Medals
of King <HI>William,</HI> near 300; The 4th Drawer was of King
<HI>William</HI>'s Ancestors and Family; he had been 40 years in making this

the best Furniture for an <HI>Historia metallica,</HI> that I ever saw.
The <HI>French</HI> K. has a par∣ticular Kindness for him, and has greatly
inricht him, and no Man Talks with more freedom to him; he is much de∣lighted
with his Humour, and will sit and see his Medals, and when he comes at any
Medal that makes against him, he will say, <HI>Sire, voyla une, qu' est
bien contre nous!</HI> as though the Matter pleased him, and he was glad to
find it to shew it the King. Monsieur <HI>le Nostre</HI> spoke much of
the good Humour of his Master; he af∣firmed to me he was never seen in
Passion, and gave me many Instances of Occasions, that would have
caused most Men to <PB N="38" REF="26"/>have raged; which yet he put by with
all the Temper imaginable.</P>
<P>In this Cabinet I saw many very rare old China Vessels, and
amongst them a small <HI>Roman Glass Ʋrn,</HI> very thick made, and
ponderous, of a blue Sea colour, the two Ears were Feet divided into 4 Claws,
but the very bottom of this Vessel was smooth, and very little
umbilicate; and for this reason I cannot tell whether it might not be
<HI>cast,</HI> and not <HI>blown.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Luxem∣burgh</HI> P.</NOTE>The <HI>Palace of
Luxemburgh</HI> is the most finisht of all the Royal Buildings; it is very
magnificent, well designed, were it not for the triflng Intersections or
round and deep Jointings of the Columns, which looks like a Cheesemongers
Shop, and which is below the grandeur of the Or∣ders, so hard a matter it is
to have a true Re∣lish of the ancient Simplicity, and not to add impertinent
Ornaments. And to say the truth, there are not many things in <HI>Paris</HI>
where this Chastity is strictly pre∣served; amongst those, where
little is to be blamed, are the South East Front of the <HI>Louvre,</HI> the
Facade of <HI>St. Gervais,</HI> and the whole Building of <HI>Val de
Grace.</HI> And this Wantonness in additional Or∣naments may perhaps be one
reason, why the <HI>Doric</HI> is more practised here at this 
<PB N="39" REF="26"/>day, the Modillions naturally admitting greater variety,
and according to the in∣tended use of the Building.</P>
<P>In this Palace is that famous Gallery, where the History of
<HI>Maria</HI> of <HI>Medicis</HI> is Painted by <HI>Rubens.</HI> Though this
was done 70 years ago, it is as fresh as at the first; so great a
Master he was in Colour∣ing. His Flesh is admirable, and his Scarlet, for
which, if he had not a se∣cret, not now understood, he had less Avarice,
and more Honour, than most of our Modern Painters. 'Tis certain the
goodness of Colours was one of the great Cares and Studies of the late
fa∣mous Painters; and that which seems most to have obliged them to it, was
the necessity they put themselves upon, to Paint all their own Designs,
and more particularly the present Dresses. And though <HI>Rubens</HI> in
his History is too much a Libertine in this respect, yet there is in this
very place, which we now describe, much truth in the habit of his principal
Figures, as of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, the Queen, her Son, the 3
Daughters and the Cardinal; though indeed the Allegoric assistants in all
the Tableaux are very airy and fancifully set out. His Scholar <HI>St. Aut.
Vandyke</HI> did introduce this No∣velty too much in <HI>England,</HI> where
the <PB N="40" REF="27"/>Persons would bear it; as the Female Sex were very
willing to do, who seem in his time to have been mighty fond of being Painted
in <HI>dishabille.</HI> 'Twas this that cut out of business the best
<HI>English</HI> Painter of his time, <HI>Cornelius Johnson,</HI> and
shortned his Life by Grief. It is certain with a little patience all Dress
becomes <HI>dishabille;</HI> but I appeal, whether it is not better and much
more pleasing to see the old Fashion of a dead Friend, or Relation, or of
a Man of Distinction, Painted as he was, than a foppish Night-Gown, and odd
Quoifure, which never belonged to the Person Painted.</P>
<P>But that which led me into this Re∣flection was, that the Modern
Painters have hereby an opportunity to be idle, and to have others to work
under them; it is sufficient to finish the Face, and to send it out to be
Drest at the Block; where∣as were they obliged in Honour to Paint the whole
Dresses, this would make them accurate in Colouring, through the great
variety which would daily occur, and and that noble Art be in a far greater
esteem.</P>
<P>A good Artist might easily reduce it, and command the Purses
of those he Paints, to pay well for his labour and time, for it is the lot
but of very few Men to excel in this Noble Art.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="27"/>In the Antichamber of the Queens Apartment there
are other Paintings of <HI>Rubens,</HI> as, in 3 distinct Tableaux, at the
upper end of the Room the Ceremonies of the Marriages of her 3 Daughters, to
<HI>Savoy, Spain,</HI> and <HI>England.</HI> Also in an other Historical
Tableaux, on the side of the same Room, he has Painted his own Picture, in
a very free and easie posture, next the Eye, up in the very corner,
look∣ing out, as unconcerned in his own Ta∣bleaux, upon the 3 Ladies. He has
done his Wife in some of the Tableaux in the great Gallery; but in the
last, where the Queen is mounting up to Heaven, she is drawn up after her;
but whether it be her full and heavy Body, or her Mind, she is Painted in a
very unwilling po∣sture, bending back: It seems her Hus∣band liked her
Company too well to part with her easily, or she with him.</P>
<P>Several of the Rooms of this Apart∣ment were Wainscoted with
Cedar, wrought in Flowers, as her Dressing Room and Oratory; which is rare
in <HI>Paris.</HI> The Floors were made of small Wood put together in
Figures, the in∣ward Knots were inlaid with Threads of Silver, which have a
marvellous effect; but the firmness, duration, and intire∣ness of these
Floors, after so long laying, <PB N="42" REF="28"/>I most admired: whereas
with us in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> and elsewhere in <HI>Paris,</HI> they prove so
noisy to tread on, and faulty, that they are in a few years intolerable.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Louvre.</HI></NOTE>'Tis pity the King has
so great an a∣version to the <HI>Louvre,</HI> which if finisht, (which he
might easily do in 2 or 3 years) would be the most Magnificent Palace,
perhaps, that ever was upon the Face of the Earth; and, indeed, without that be
done, <HI>Paris</HI> will never arrive at its full Beauty.</P>
<P>There are two Stones in the Fronton of the South East Facade of
the <HI>Louvre,</HI> which are shewed to all Strangers, co∣vering the very
top of it, as Slates do, and meet in an angle. These are very big,
<HI>viz.</HI> 54 foot long a-piece, 8 foot broad, and but 14 inches thick: The
raising so high these two vast and tender Stones was lookt upon as a
Master-piece of Art, e∣qualling any thing of the Ancients of that Nature.
They were taken out of the Quarries of <HI>Meudon,</HI> where Mon∣seigneur
the Dauphin dwells.</P>
<P>I saw in the Galleries of the <HI>Louvre</HI> some of the
Battles of <HI>Alexander</HI> by <HI>Le Brun;</HI> which are by the
<HI>French</HI> the most admired Pieces of Painting that have been (say
they) done by any Man on this side the <HI>Alpes;</HI> <PB N="43" REF="28"/>and of which they are not a little proud.</P>
<P>Also a large Piece of <HI>Paulo Verenese,</HI> presented by
the Senate of <HI>Venice</HI> to the King.</P>
<P>I cannot pass by unmentioned the vast number of great Cases in
one of the Gal∣leries, wherein are the <HI>Play things or Pup∣pets</HI> of the
Dauphin, when a Child: They represent a Camp in all its parts, and cost
50000 Crowns.</P>
<P>But, indeed, that which most surprised me in the
<HI>Louvre</HI> was the <HI>Artellier</HI> or Work-house of Monsieur
<HI>Gerardon;</HI> he that made Cardinal <HI>Richelieu's Tomb,</HI> and the
<HI>Statua Equestris</HI> designed for the <HI>Place de Vendosme;</HI> he
told me he had been al∣most 10 years in making the Model with assiduity
and daily application.</P>
<P>He hath in the <HI>Louvre</HI> also two Rooms, in one are ancient
Marble Statues, and in the other are Brass Statues and <HI>Vasa,</HI> and a
100 other things relating to Anti∣quity: There is nothing in <HI>Paris</HI>
deserves more to be seen.</P>
<P>In this last, I saw a sort of <HI>Egyptian Janus,</HI> with
<HI>Silenus</HI> on one side, and a <HI>Bacchus</HI> on the other; With many
o∣ther <HI>Egyptian Figures</HI> well designed; all of them with a
<HI>hole</HI> in the Crown of the Head.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="29"/>Also a <HI>Lion of Aegypt</HI> very large of
Brass; but the design rude, and more like an <HI>Indian Pagod.</HI> This
also had a large square hole in the Back, near the Neck. The
<HI>Siamites</HI> that came in an Em∣bassiy to <HI>Paris,</HI> were well
pleased to see this Figure, and said, it was not unlike one of theirs;
and that that hole served to put the Incense in, that the Smoak might come
out of the Body and No∣strils of the Lion. I doubt not but that also was
the use of the open Crowns of the rest of the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Figures,
which I had seen elsewhere, as well as here; and their Heads served for
<HI>Perfuming Pots</HI> for themselves: and hence also might arise, that
other Ornament of <HI>Ra∣diated Heads;</HI> as this here, of a bright Flame,
casting Rays out of and round the Head.</P>
<P>There was also a small Image of a Lean Man, Cast
<HI>bent,</HI> in a sitting Posture, with a roll of Parchment spread open
up∣on his Knees, and he looking down upon it, Reading it. This was of <HI>Solid
Brass,</HI> the Head and all: This was found in∣closed in a <HI>Mummy.</HI>
He seemed to have a thin Linnen Garment on, perhaps such as the
<HI>Aegyptian</HI> Priests used to wear.</P>
<P>Also he shewed us the <HI>Mummy of a Woman</HI> intire: The
scent of the Hand was <PB N="45" REF="29"/>to me not unpleasant; but I could
not liken it to any Perfume now in use with us; tho' I make no question,
but <HI>Naptha</HI> was the great Ingredient; which indeed is so unusual a
Smell, that the <HI>Mineral Waters</HI> of <HI>Hogsden</HI> near
<HI>London,</HI> (wherein the true <HI>Naptha</HI> is Substantially, and of
which I have some Ounces by me, ga∣thered off of those Waters) have
imposed upon the ignorant in Natural History; who would make them come from
a chance Turpentine Effusion, or the Miscarriage of a Chymical
Experiment.</P>
<P>Here were also great variety of <HI>Ʋrns</HI> and <HI>Funeral
Vasa</HI> of all Materials and Fashions.</P>
<P>Also an antient <HI>Writing-Pen</HI> coil'd up, with two ends
erected both a-like, repre∣senting the Head of a Snake.</P>
<P>The <HI>Antient Heads</HI> and Busto's in Brass are numerous and
of great value. This Gentleman is exceeding Courteous to all Strangers;
especially to such as have the least good relish of Things of this
Na∣ture, to whom he shews them gladly. It cannot be otherwise, that a Man
Edu∣cated in that Noble Art of Sculpture, who shall daily study so great
a variety of Originals of the best Masters, but must far excell the
rest of Mankind, who pra∣ctise without good Example, and by fancy
mostly.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="30"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monsieur
<HI>Boudelet.</HI></NOTE>I was to see Monfieur <HI>Boudelot,</HI> whose
Friendship I highly value: I received great Civilities from him. He is well
known by his Books about the <HI>Ʋtility of Voyages:</HI> He has a very
choice and large Collection of Books of Greek and Roman Learning. I made him
several Visits, and had the pleasure of perusing his Ca∣binet of Coins,
and small Images of Copper, which are many and of good value; as
<HI>Aegyptian, Phrygian, Grecian,</HI> and <HI>Roman.</HI></P>
<P>Amongst his <HI>Aegyptian,</HI> the most cu∣rious was a <HI>Deus
Crepitus</HI> of admirable Workmanship, with a Radiated Crown: It was an

very usually represented their Kings under the Figures of their Gods.</P>
<P>There was also the Skeleton of a Wo∣man of solid Copper, found
in the Body of a Mummy, in a sitting Posture; not unlike that other
mentioned above in Monsieur <HI>Girardon</HI>'s Closet.</P>
<P>An <HI>Apis</HI> or a <HI>Heifer</HI> in Copper.</P>
<P>A Phrygian <HI>Priapus</HI> of Elegant Work∣manship: The

<P><PB N="47" REF="30"/>Of all which, and many more, this Learned
Antiquary intends to write.</P>
<P>In his Cabinet of Medals I could not find one of <HI>Palmyra,</HI>
for which I care∣fully enquired; for I was willing to add what could be found
in <HI>France</HI> upon this Subject.</P>
<P>He has also many <HI>Marbles from Greece;</HI> most of which
have been publish'd by <HI>Spon;</HI> save one, and that is the most
Antient and most Curious of all; con∣cerning which he is ready to publish a
Dissertation. 'Tis a Catalogue in Three Columns, of the Names of the most
principal Persons of <HI>Erectheis,</HI> one of the chiefest Tribes of
<HI>Attica,</HI> that were killed in one and the same year in five several
Places, where the <HI>Athenians</HI> fought under two Generals, as in
<HI>Cyprus,</HI> in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> in <HI>Phaenitia,</HI> in <HI>Aegina,</HI>
in <HI>Halies. Here are</HI> 177 <HI>Names in the</HI> 3 <HI>Columns. See</HI>
Table I.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mautis</HI> closes the Column, he di∣ed in
<HI>Aegypt,</HI> that is, the Physician; Ma∣gick and Physick went together
in those days; nay, the very Comedians and Poets, those necessary Men
of Wit, fought, for none were exempt from being Inroll'd that were Born in the
Kingdom or Re∣publick of <HI>Attica.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="31"/>The Antiquity of this Marble, besides the
known History and Names which ju∣stifie the time of those Men: The Figure
of the Letters are an undoubted Argu∣ment; for there are no double Letters
here; no η, no ω, but all graved with e, o; also the Letters, L, P,
Π, R, S, are very Roman. So that it is also an Evi∣dence, that the Romans
borrowed their Letters from the Antient Greek Alpha∣bet.</P>
<P>The Invention and Borrowing of Let∣ters was a great Happiness to
Mankind. The Embarras in which Writing is in <HI>China,</HI> is owing to the
Misfortune of wanting an Alphabet; so that the <HI>Chinese</HI> are forc'd
to express every Sentence and Thought by a different Character, which has
multiplied their Writing to 120000 Characters; of which yet they have less
need than we in <HI>Europe,</HI> who perform all with 24 Letters, (whereof 5
add life to the other 19, saith <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> which is an Argument of
the Age he writ in, the Knowledge of Grammar, <HI>i. e.</HI> Read∣ing and
Writing, depends upon seven Figures, <HI>de Dieta.</HI> 1.) the
<HI>Chineses</HI> know much less than we; they have no other Morals, they
have less Philosophy, less Ma∣thematicks, fewer Arts, and yet much
nar∣rower Knowledge of Natural History, be∣cause <PB N="49" REF="31"/>they
can know but of that, which they have at home: In what therefore should they
employ this multitude of Characters! 'Tis, I say, their Misfortune not to
have Thought of an Alphabet: Their common Language is as easily learnt, and
consequently might as easily be writ, as any in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to Monsieur <HI>Budelot</HI>'s Stores. In this
Cabinet I also saw some <HI>Basse-Relieves:</HI> One of
<HI>Praxiteles</HI> well de∣signed; one of <HI>Musos</HI> the Comoedian:
Amongst the rest of the Marbles there is a Basse-Relief, very extant,
and finely fi∣nisht, of a Cupid asleep, leaning his Head upon his Left Arm;
In his Hand he holds two <HI>Poppy Heads.</HI> 'Tis probable the Poppies were
Emblimatique from the Power they have in Love-Affairs. In∣deed, most
Poisons affect those Parts chiefly, being the great Sluce of the Ha∣bit of
the Body, or Circle of the Blood; and no People use Poppy more, and stand
more in need of it, than the Men who delight in Polygamy, the
<HI>Mahome∣tans,</HI> or understand it better; as <HI>Olearius</HI>
testifies.</P>
<P>He had an Antick <HI>Busto</HI> of <HI>Zenobia</HI> in Marble,
with a thick Radiated Crown; of which he very obligingly gave me a 
<PB N="50" REF="32"/>Copy, well designed from the Original: This was brought
out of <HI>Asia</HI> by Mon∣sieur <HI>Thevenot.</HI></P>
<P>He shewed me a <HI>Dissertation</HI> he had written out fair
for the Press, about a certain Antient <HI>Intaglia</HI> of <HI>Madames,</HI>
of <HI>Ptolomaeus Auletes,</HI> or the Player upon the Flute: In this the thin
<HI>Mufler</HI> is the most remarkable Thing, which covers the Mouth and
Nose. This Head is Ingraved upon an Amithyst.</P>
<P>I enjoyed this Gentleman's Company very often; and had much
Discourse with him about his Books of the <HI>Ʋtility of Voyages;</HI>
and in one Conversation took the freedom to Dissent from him about the
Interpretation of that Coin in Mon∣sieur <HI>Seguin,</HI> which he calls
<HI>Britannick.</HI></P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Boudelot</HI> reads it thus, <HI>Jovi Victori
Saturnalia Io!</HI> or <HI>Jovi Victoria Sat. Io!</HI></P>
<P>I had rather read it thus, <HI>Io! Sat. Victoriae Io!</HI> upon the
occasion of his returning with the Souldiers, filling their Head-Pieces with
the Shells they had gathered off of the Sea-shore; and the little use of
his new invented Letter the <HI>Digamma,</HI> which he instituted or borrowed
from the <HI>Eolique</HI> to express V Consonant.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="32"/>The Shells were a Triumph much like this small
addition to the Alphabet; which lasted no longer than his time: that is,
<HI>Victory enough,</HI> (for so stupid a Prince as <HI>Claudius</HI>)
Let's return with the Spoils of the Ocean, and Adorn his new invented Letter
with a Palm-Branch; the Reverse of this Coin being a Lawrel-Crown: Both the
Signs of Victory.</P>
<P>About the <HI>Boustrophedon</HI> way of Wri∣ting, mentioned by
<HI>Suidas</HI> and <HI>Pausanias,</HI> or turning again as the Ox Plows, or
the Racers about the <HI>Meta</HI> in the <HI>Cirque,</HI> in my Opinion it
could be nothing else, but the Serpentine manner of Writing found in
<HI>Swedeland</HI> in <HI>Runique</HI> Letters.</P>
<P>He shewed me also a <HI>Stone</HI> taken late∣ly out of the Body
of a Horse at <HI>Paris,</HI> which was his Death; and dying strange∣ly,
they Dissected him, that is, certain Ignorant People; in the lower part of
the Body, (probable the Bladder) was found this Stone: It weighs, as I guess,
two Pound; it is as round as a Cannon Ball; it is laminated like an Onion; for
the first <HI>Couche</HI> was broken up in some Places, of a dark Hair
colour, and transparent; or like some Cloudy Agats which I have seen: It
was very ponderous. Such like Transparent Stones I had a Patient voided often
in <HI>Yorkshire.</HI> I saw another Trans∣parent <PB N="52" REF="33"/>one, which was cut out of the Buttock of an Alderman at
<HI>Doncaster;</HI> he was twice cut in the same place, at some years
distance. Another I had in some measure transparent, voided by a
Patient, which was of the very colour of a Coffee-Berry when burnt; but of this
Stone Monsieur <HI>Boudelot</HI> writ me a Let∣ter before I left
<HI>Paris,</HI> which I design to publish.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Observa∣toire.</HI></NOTE>I was by

Winding Staircases. The Stones are laid inside, outside, with the most
regularity I ever saw in any Mo∣dern Building; In all this Building there is
neither Iron nor Wood, but all firmly covered with Stone, Vault upon Vault. The
Platform a-top is very spacious, and gives a large and fair view of all
<HI>Paris,</HI> and the Countrey about it; it is Paved with Black Flint in
small squares, which I make no doubt are set in Cement or Tarras, that
is, the <HI>Pulvis Puteolanus.</HI></P>
<P>We were shewed a Room well furnisht with Models of all sorts
of Machines; and a very large <HI>Burning Glass,</HI> about 3 
<PB N="53" REF="33"/>foot diameter, which at that time of the year,
<HI>viz.</HI> in the beginning of <HI>February,</HI> did fire Wood into a
flame, in the very moment it came into and past through the
<HI>Focus.</HI></P>
<P>I was indisposed, and so could not ac∣cept of the Favour which
was offered me of seeing the Moon in their Telescopes; and to go down into
the Vault, which was contrived for seeing the Stars at Noon∣tide, but without
success. I was told by Monsieur <HI>Roman</HI> afterwards, that there was
a Rock formed in the Cave by the dropping of a Spring of Petrifying Wa∣ter; of
which Nature are all the Wells in <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Flore</HI> of one of the Octogone Towers they have

<P>His Nephew Monsieur <HI>Moraldi</HI> was with him; as for his

by his Father in the Mathematicks, and all o∣ther useful Learning.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="34"/><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Triumphal

Antoine</HI> is well worth seeing; for in this the <HI>French</HI> pretend
not only to have imi∣tated the Ancients, but to have out-done them. They have
indeed, used the great∣est Blocks of Stone that could be got, and have laid
them without Mortar, and the least side outward, after the manner of the
Ancients; but I am afraid their Materials are very short of the
<HI>Roman,</HI> and their Stone is ill chose, though vastly great.</P>
<P>Indeed the <HI>Design</HI> is most Magnificent; it is finisht
in <HI>Plaister,</HI> that is, the <HI>Model</HI> of it, in its full Beauty
and Proportions.</P>
<P>I suppose it was intended for a Gate or Entrance into the City;
for it fronts the great Street of the Suburbs, and has a vast Walk planted
with Trees leading from it towards <HI>Bois de Vincennes.</HI></P>
<P>There is nothing more built but the four Parts of the Foundation of
the true Building, raised only to the foot of the Pedestals; The Foundation
is laid 22 foot deep.</P>
<P>Amongst the vast Blocks of Stone, which take up a great
compass before the Building, I found several sorts, all brought from the
Quarries not far from <HI>Paris;</HI> all of them are of a kind of course
Grit, which will not burn into <PB N="55" REF="34"/>Lime. They distinguish
these Stones in∣to 4 sorts; 1. <HI>Pierre d'arcueil,</HI> for the first 2
or 3 couches or lays above the Foun∣dation; This is <HI>St. Clou,</HI> which is
good, and the next best. I did not find by the Blocks designed either for
the Walls of the Building; or the Rounds of the Pil∣lars; that the Beds of
Stone of <HI>St. Clou</HI> are above two foot thick. 3. That of <HI>S.
Lieu;</HI> this is but indifferent, but yet much better then that Stone which
is taken up out of the Stone Pits, in and about <HI>Paris,</HI> which makes the
4th sort of Stone: If it be wrought up into Walls, as it is taken out of the
Pits, it is very apt to be flawed by the Frost; but if it be laid in the Air,
and kept under cover for two years, then it becomes dry and more durable.</P>
<P>I saw but one Piece in <HI>Paris</HI> of the Ruines of an <HI>Old
Roman Building;</HI> it was in <HI>La Rue de la Harpe.</HI> The Vaults are very
high and large. The manner of Building is near the same I formerly caused
exactly to be figured and described at <HI>York,</HI> and which is publisht
in the <HI>Phi∣losophic Transactions;</HI> That is, the inside and
outside of the Walls are composed of six Rows of small square Stones,
and then 4 rows of flat, thin and broad <HI>Roman <PB N="56" REF="35"/>Bricks,</HI> and so alternatively from the top to the bottom; Which
makes it proba∣ble it was built after <HI>Severus</HI>'s time, for this was the
<HI>African</HI> manner of Building, as <HI>Vitruvius</HI> tells us; and
therefore might well be, what Tradition here says of it, <HI>viz.</HI> part
of <HI>Julian</HI> the Emperor's Palace, or <HI>Thermae.</HI></P>

Row of Houses built in their room, and the Bones re∣moved I know not whether;
The rest of the Church-Yard in the most neglected and nastiest pickle I

they can do it with a good sto∣mach; and leave the Tombs of Chan∣cellors and

<P><PB N="58" REF="36"/>Here were also 2 or 3 very fair ones of that
sort of comprest Snail, which have their Tail on the same side with
their Mouth; and the Vulgar Name, by which those <HI>Men of Cabinets</HI>
distinguish them, is not amiss, <HI>viz. Des Lampes.</HI></P>
<P>He shewed me a Bivalve, which is not uncommon (in a large
<HI>Blood red Spondile</HI>) for which the late Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> gave
900 Livres, which is above 50<HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR> Sterling;</HI> and he also
assured me, that the same Per∣son offered a <HI>Parisian</HI> for 32
Shells 11000 Livres; which Sum was refused; but the Duke replied, That he
knew not who was the greater Fool, he that bid the Price, or the Man that
refused it.</P>
<P>I also saw in this Collection an <HI>Hippo∣campus</HI> about 4
inches long, the Tail square, thick Bellied and Breast like a <HI>Miller
Thumb,</HI> Winged not unlike a sort of Flying Fish, but the Fins were
spoiled, the Membranes being torn from the Bones of the Wings, the Head long
and square like the Tail, with a sort of tufted Musle. This Fish I took
to be of the <HI>Hippocampus</HI> Kind; and (as he told me) it was given him by
my Lady <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> possibly out of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s
Collection, who had many curious Presents made him (as one of Shells from the
States of <HI>Holland,</HI> ma∣ny of which I have seen in other Hands) 
<PB N="59" REF="36"/>but he suffered them all to be dissipated and
lost.</P>
<P>Here also was a <HI>Vespetum Canadense</HI> of a most
elegant Figure, and admirable Con∣trivance; of which I have a Drawing. This is
intire in all its parts; it is as big as a middle-sized Melon,
Pear-fashion, with an edge running round where it is thickest, from which
edge it suddenly declines and lessens into a point; at the very end of
the point, on one side, is a little hole, with pulvinated or smooth edges
inclined inward; otherwise it is whole, and wrought upon the Twig of a Tree,
of a very smooth Sattin-like Skin. <HI>Table</HI> 1. <HI>Figure</HI> 1.</P>
<P>Also the Striated Skin of an <HI>African</HI> Ass, supple and
well cured, which I had never seen before. It is certainly a most beautiful
Animal; and, I admire, after so many Ages that it has been known to the
People of <HI>Europe,</HI> it could never be Tamed, and made of common use,
as the rest of the Horse Kind. This was only of two colours, <HI>viz.</HI>
broad lists of White and Bay or Chesnut colour drawn from the Back down the
Sides to the Bel∣ly, which was all White: The lists were parted at the Back
by a very narrow ridge of short Hair; which Lists also went round the
Legs like Garters. The Hair <PB N="60" REF="37"/>coloured Stripes of the
<HI>African</HI> Ass were, near the Back, 3 or 4 Fingers broad, also the
List down the Back was very broad.</P>
<P>Another Skin of a Cap-Ass I after∣wards saw at Dr.
<HI>Turnfords;</HI> and the Stripes were the same, but much broader and
darker coloured; it may be from the different Ages. This sort of Striping
seems to be peculiar to the Ass, for the most common to be seen with us
have all a <HI>Black List</HI> down the Back; and two more, that is, on each
side one, run∣ning down the Shoulders.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. <HI>Turn∣fort.</HI></NOTE>I saw Monsieur
<HI>Turnfort</HI>'s Collection of Shells, which are well chosen, and not
above one or two of a sort; but very perfect and beautiful, and in good
order, consisting of about 20 Drawers.</P>
<P>There was amongst them a very large <HI>Land Shell,</HI> the
same which I have fi∣gured from the <HI>Musaeum</HI> at <HI>Oxford,</HI>
having its turn from the right hand to the left. Also many very excellent and
large Pa∣terns of other <HI>Land Snails;</HI> also a <HI>Fresh-water
Mussel from Brasil,</HI> which I had never seen before; a Pair of them
he gave me; and many Species of Fresh-water <HI>Buccina</HI> from the
<HI>Carribe</HI> Islands. Also an <HI>Auris Marina Spisse
echinata;</HI> which was new to me.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="37"/>Amongst the Shells the <HI>Thinn
Oister,</HI> which shines within like Mother of Pearl, and has in the
uppermost end of the flat Valve, near the Hinge, <HI>a Hole.</HI> These he
brought with him, and took them up alive, from the Rocks in <HI>Spain;</HI> he
said they were very offensively <HI>bitter</HI> to the taste. These
being perfect, I had the op∣portunity of seeing that Hole shut with a
peculiar and <HI>third</HI> Shell, of the fashion of a Pouch or Shepherds
Purse.</P>
<P>I shall say nothing of his vast Collecti∣on of Seeds and
Fruits, and dried Plants, which alone amount to 8000, and in this he equals, if
not excells all the most curious Herborists in <HI>Europe.</HI> His
Her∣borisations about <HI>Paris</HI> he gave me to car∣ry for
<HI>England,</HI> just then Printed off; also he shewed me the Designs
of about 100 <HI>European Non Descript Plants,</HI> in 8<HI>vo.</HI> which he
intends next to publish.</P>
<P>He also shewed me 10 or 12 single Sheets of Vellom, on each of
which were Paint∣ed in Water Colours very lively, one single Plant, mostly
in flower, by the best Artist in <HI>Paris,</HI> at the King's Charge;
Those are sent to <HI>Versailles,</HI> when the Doctor has put the Names
to them, and there kept: In this manner the King has above 2000 rare Plants,
and they work daily upon others: The Limner has two Louis's for every Plant he
Paints.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="38"/>I saw there also the <HI>Vespetum
Canadense Maximum,</HI> about 12 inches long, and 6 in diameter; of a Pear
fashion; it hangs by a long and broad loop to the Twig of a Tree; The broad
or lower end is a little pointed, and rising in the middle; The outward Skin
is as smooth as Velom, and of a whitish grey, next to the Pearl colour. The
Button at the bigger end in this being broken, and the outward Skin pilled off,
I could see a hole of about half an inch diameter in the very middle, into
which the Wasps go in and out; The Cells are sexangular, but of a very
small size, not much bigger then a Duck Quill, or very small Goose
Quill; and consequently appear very thick set and numerous. <HI>See the
Figure above.</HI></P>
<P>He shewed me also a very great <HI>Julus</HI> from
<HI>Brasil,</HI> at least six inches long, and two about, round like a
Cord, very smooth and shining, of a kind of Cop∣per or Brazen colour; The
Feet infinite, like a double Fringe on each side: This he had from <HI>F.
Plumier,</HI> who after∣wards gave me a Design of it drawn by the Life, and
in its proper colours. <HI>Table</HI> 5.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="38"/>Dr. <HI>Turnfort</HI> shewed me a Present
which was made him by his Country Man of <HI>Provence,</HI> Monsieur
<HI>Boyeur d'Aguilles,</HI> of a large Book in Folio of curious
<HI>Stamps.</HI> This is only the first part of his Cabinet, all Graved at
the Author's Charge; and he is said to be another <HI>Peiresk,</HI> which
would be happy for Mankind, and a great Honour to that Country to have produced
two <HI>Moecena</HI>'s in one Age.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Verney.</HI></NOTE>I was to see Monsieur
<HI>Verney</HI> at his A∣partment at the upper-end of the Royal Physick
Garden; but missing my Visit, went up, with a young Gentleman of my Lord
Ambassador's Retinue, to see Mr. <HI>Bennis,</HI> who was in the
Dissecting Room, working by himself upon a Dead Body, with his Breast
and Belly gutted: There were very odd things to be seen in the Room. My
Companion, it being morning, and his Senses very quick and vigorous, was
strangely surprised and offended; and retired down the Stairs much
faster than he came up: And in∣deed, a private Anatomy Room is to one not
accustomed to this kind of Manufa∣cture, very irksome, if not frightful:
Here a Basket of Dissecting Instruments, as Knives, Saws,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> And there a Form with a Thigh and Leg flayed, and the 
<PB N="64" REF="39"/>Muscles parted asunder: On another Form an Arm served
after the same manner: Here a Trey full of Bits of Flesh, for the more
minute Discovery of the Veins and Nerves; and every where such
discou∣raging Objects. So, as if Reason, and the good of Mankind did not
put Men upon this Study, it could not be en∣dured: for Instinct and Nature
most cer∣tainly abhors the Employment.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monsieur <HI>Merrie.</HI></NOTE>I saw
Monsieur <HI>Merrie,</HI> a most painful and accurate Anatomist, and free
and communicative Person, at his House <HI>Rue de la Princesse.</HI>
His Cabinet consisted of two Chambers: In the outward were great variety of
Skeletons; also entire Preparations of the Nerves; in two of which he
shewed me the mistake of <HI>Willis,</HI> and from thence gathered, that he
was not much used to Dissect with his own Hand: The <HI>Pia Mater</HI>
coating the Spinal Nerves but half way down the Back, where it ends: The
<HI>Dura Mater</HI> coating the lowermost 20 pair; which, <HI>Willis,</HI>
(as he said) has otherwise reported.</P>
<P>But that which much delighted my Curiosity, was the
Demonstration of a blown and dried Heart of a <HI>Foetus;</HI> also the
Heart of a <HI>Tortoise.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="39"/>In the Heart of a <HI>Foetus,</HI> he shewed
it quite open, and he would have it that there was no Valve to the <HI>Foramen
Ovale;</HI> which seem'd equally open from the Left Ventricle to the Right,
as the contrary; that it's Diameter well near equalled that of the
<HI>Aorta:</HI> That the two Arteries, which ascend up into the two Lobes of
the Lungs, (and are the Ramifications of the Pulmonick Artery, after it has
parted with the <HI>Canal of Communication,</HI> which goes betwixt the
Pulmonick Artery and the lower or descending Branch of the <HI>Aorta</HI>)
both put together, far exceed, if not double the Diameter of the <HI>Aorta</HI>
it self.</P>
<P>He therefore, not without good Reason assirms, That of all the
Blood which the <HI>Vena Cava</HI> pours into the Right Ventricle of the Heart,
and is thence in a <HI>Foetus</HI> forced up into the Pulmonick Artery, a great
part is carried by the Canal of Com∣munication into the descending Trunk of
the <HI>Aorta,</HI> and is so circulated about the Body, the Lungs (as to
that part) be∣ing wholly slighted: Also that of the two remaining thirds of
the Blood, which is carried about the Lungs, when it comes down the Pulmonick
Vein, that which cannot be received by the <HI>Aorta,</HI> (and all cannot,
because the <HI>Aorta</HI> is much less <PB N="66" REF="40"/>than the two
Branches of the Pulmonick Artery put together) is therefore <HI>discharged
back</HI> through the <HI>Foramen Ovale,</HI> into the Right Ventricle of the
Heart, and so thrown up again with the rest of the Blood, coming from the
<HI>Vena Cava.</HI> So that one part of the two remaining parts of the Blood is
daily carried about the Body, as in an Adult Foetus, and a third part only
Circulates in the Lungs, pas∣sing by the Body or Grand Circulati∣on.</P>
<P>That all this is done to abbreviate and reduce the Circulation to a
lesser compass, is certain; and so for the same Reason and End,
that other lesser Circu∣lation of the Liver is slighted by the Blood,
which returns from the Placenta, by a Canal of Communication betwixt the
<HI>Porta</HI> and the <HI>Vena Cava.</HI></P>
<P>The Reason he gives of this, I can∣not at all allow of; as being
very ill grounded; and therefore I shall not trou∣ble my self to Confute,
or so much as Name it.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Heart of the Land Tortoise,</HI> it was preserved
in Spirit of Wine, and all the three Ventricles thereof slit and opened; so
that I had not all the Satis∣faction I could have wisht: but the Left 
<PB N="67" REF="40"/>Ventricle in this Animal had no Artery belonging to it, but
did receive only the Blood, which descended from the Lungs, and convey it by
the <HI>Foramen Ovale</HI> into the Right Ventricle: That the third or middle
Ventricle was only an Appendix to the Right, and had the Pulmonick Ar∣tery
issuing from it. So that the Blood in a <HI>Tortois</HI> was in a manner
Circulated like that in a <HI>Foetus,</HI> through the Body, the Lungs as it
were or in good part slighted.</P>
<P>This Thought of Monsieur <HI>Merrie</HI>'s has made a great Breach
betwixt Monsieur <HI>Verney</HI> and himself; for which Reason I had not
that freedom of Conversation as I could have wisht with both of them; but
'tis to be hoped there may come good from an honest Emulation.</P>
<P>Two English Gentlemen came to Visit me, Mr. <HI>Bennis</HI> and
Mr. <HI>Probie:</HI> They were lodged near the Royal Garden, where Monsieur
<HI>Verney</HI> dwells, and makes his Anatomies, who in Three Months time
shewed all the Parts of the Body to them. He had for this purpose at
least Twenty Human Bodies, from the Gal∣lows, the Chatelet, (where those
are ex∣pos'd who are found Murthered in the Streets, which is a very common
business at <HI>Paris</HI>) and from the Hospitals.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="41"/> They told me, Monsieur <HI>Verney</HI>
pre∣tended to shew them a Valve, which did hinder Blood from falling back
into the Right Ventricle by the <HI>Foramen Ovale.</HI> This Valve they said
he compared to the Papillae in the Kidneys, Musculous and Fleshy: That if
Wind was blown into the <HI>Vena Pulmonalis,</HI> it did not pass through the
<HI>Foramen Ovale,</HI> but stop there, by reason of the Valve. That he did
be∣lieve, contrary to Mr. <HI>Merrie,</HI> that no Blood did circulate through
the Lungs in an Embrio.</P>
<P>Again, in another Conversation with Monsieur <HI>Merrie,</HI> he
shewed me the blown Hearts of an Embrio, and that of a Girl of 7 years old. I
saw clearly, that the Skin of the supposed Valve of the <HI>Fora∣men
Ovale,</HI> was as it were suspended with two Ligaments: And that in the
Girl's, the two sides of the <HI>Foramen Ovale</HI> were drawn one over the
other, and so closed the hole; but were easily to be sepa∣rated again
by a Bristle thrust betwixt them.</P>
<P>Also it seemed to me, that this Mem∣brane in an Embrio might
cover the <HI>Fo∣ramen Ovale,</HI> like the <HI>Membrana Nictans</HI> in a
Brids Eye, that is, be drawn over it, and so hinder the Ingress of the
Blood from the <HI>Vena Cava,</HI> as oft as the Right Au∣ricle 
<PB N="69" REF="41"/>beats: But the Dilating it self might give way to the
descending Blood of the <HI>Vena Pulmonalis;</HI> and possibly, the
Em∣brio living as it were the Life of an In∣sect, can by this Artifice
Command the Heart.</P>
<P>I remember in Discourse that day with him, he told me, That
Monsieur <HI>Verney</HI> had an old <HI>Cat,</HI> and a young
<HI>Kitling</HI> just Born, put into the Air-Pump before the <HI>Academie
Royalle des Sciences:</HI> That the Cat died after 16 Pumps, but the Kitling
sur∣vived 500 Pumps; which favours in some measure the Command young
Ani∣mals have of their Hearts.</P>
<P>At another Visit, Monsieur <HI>Merrie</HI> ob∣ligingly procured
for me, the Heart of a Human Embrio, with the Lungs intire. He tried before me
the Experiment upon Blowing, and also Syringing Water into the
<HI>Aorta,</HI> both which filled the Auricles and Ventricles, and freely came
out at the <HI>Vena Cava</HI> only. Then he opened the Right Auricle and
Ventricle, where the <HI>Foramen Ovale</HI> was open only at one cor∣ner, not
the tenth part of its breadth; and a Membrane drawn over the rest, which
Membrane was fastned to the sides quite round. Then he opened in the same
manner the Left Ventricle and Au∣ricle, and there it was evident, that that 
<PB N="70" REF="42"/>Membrane which closed the hole, had two narrow Straps or
Muscles by which it was fastned to the opposite sides, after the manner
of some of the Valves of the Heart.</P>
<P>I told him, that it must follow from this, that the <HI>Foramen
Ovale</HI> was shut and opened more or less, at the pleasure of the
Embrio, according to the Necessities of Nature, and the quantity of Blood
that was to pass: That it was probable, that all Insects had a Command of
their Hearts, (of which I had given large In∣stances elsewhere) by some
such passage, which they could shut altogether, or in great part, as
they had a Mind, in Winter, in Fear, or Fasting for want of Food: That the
shutting up of the passage in Adult Animals was therefore done in an
instant, by drawing the Curtain fully, which could never be again drawn back
and opened, because of the great torrent of Blood, which now entred the Right
Auricle, stopt it in that posture, which in time would altogether stiffen
and lose its Motion of Relaxation. As a Hen, when she Sleeps, draws over
the <HI>Mem∣brana Nictans;</HI> and likewise when she Dies, the same
Membrane covers all the Eye.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="42"/>Mr. <HI>Bennis</HI> procured me the Heart of a
Humane <HI>Foetus,</HI> which had but just breath'd; the which I examined
with Monsieur <HI>Litre</HI> of <HI>Castres</HI> in <HI>Languedoc,</HI>
another very Understanding and Dextrous Anatomist, and who Teaches Scholars
of all Nations the Practice of Anatomy. The Experiments here were repeated as
formerly described; Both Wind and Water passed the <HI>Foramen
Ovale,</HI> both from the <HI>Vena Pulmonum,</HI> and from the <HI>Aorta.</HI>
That which I observed in this Heart more particularly, was, That the Membrane
or Valve on the Left side of the <HI>Foramen Ovale</HI> was flat, and
extended almost over the hole, without any <HI>Limbus</HI> round its edges,
because it was nothing but the very substance of the <HI>Auricula
Sinistra</HI> continued, or a Process thereof: But on the right side the
<HI>Vena Cava</HI> being joined to the Auricle, it had a rising edge round
that part of it, whence it proceeded; that is, that the two Faces had contrery
openings, and being drawn as it were one over the other, they shut the hole;
but not so firmly, but the hole might be more or less open all a Man's
Life. For those two Oval Processes sticking close together in a blown
and dried Heart, that is not to be much heeded, for I have seen them dry with
<PB N="72" REF="43"/>the hole open; but it has been like as betwixt unglued
Paper, or as the Ure∣thers descend betwixt the Skins of the Bladder, or as
the same happens to the <HI>Ductus Bilaris</HI> in its insertion into the
Guts.</P>
<P>The same Person brought me the Heart of a Man 40 years old, in
which the <HI>Foramen Ovale</HI> was as much open, as in a <HI>Foetus</HI> new
born; and the Ligaments very conspicuous, which tack the sides of the Valve
to the Auricle, and go over to the other side of the Border.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>F. Plumier.</HI></NOTE>I was not better
pleased with any Visit I made, than with that of <HI>F. Plumier,</HI> whom
I found in his Cell in the Con∣vent of the <HI>Minimes.</HI> He came home in
the Sieur <HI>Ponti</HI>'s Squadron, and brought with him several <HI>Books
in Folio</HI> of Designs and Paintings of <HI>Plants, Birds, Fishes,</HI>
and <HI>Infects</HI> of the <HI>West-Indies;</HI> all done by himself very
accurately. He is a very understanding Man in several parts of Natural
History, but especially in <HI>Bota∣nique.</HI> he had been formerly in
<HI>America,</HI> at his return Printed, at the King's Charge, a Book of
<HI>American</HI> Plants in Folio. This Book was so well approved of, that he
was sent again thither at the King's Charge, and returned after several
years <PB N="73" REF="43"/>wandring about the Islands with this Cargo. He was
more than once Ship∣wrackt, and lost his <HI>Specimens</HI> of all things,
but preserved his Papers, as ha∣ving fortunately lodged them in other
Ves∣sels; so that the things themselves I did not see. He had
designed and Dissected a Crocodile; one of the Sea Tortoises; a Viper,
and well described the Dissecti∣ons.</P>
<P>His Birds also were well understood, and very well painted in
their proper colours. I took notice of 3 sorts of Owles, one with Horns, all
distinct Species from our <HI>European.</HI> Several of the Hawk Kind and
Falcons of very beautiful Plumage; and one of those, which was Coal black as
a Raven. Also (which I longed to see) there was one Species of the Swallow
Kind, very distinct from the 4 Species we have in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Amongst the Fish there were two new Species of <HI>American</HI>
Trouts, well known by the Fleshy Fin near the Tail.</P>
<P>Amongst the Insects there was a <HI>Scolo∣pendra</HI> of a foot
and an half long, and proportionably broad. Also the <HI>Julus</HI> very
elegantly painted, which I had seen before in Dr. <HI>Turnfort</HI>'s
Collection. <HI>Table</HI> 5.</P>
<P>Also a very large Wood-Frog, with the extremity of the Toes
webbed.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="44"/>Also a Blood-red <HI>Polypus,</HI> with very
long Legs, two of which I could discern by the Draught were thick
<HI>acetabulated.</HI> This, he told me, was so venemous, that upon the
least touch it would cause an insupportable burning pain, which would
last several hours.</P>
<P>There were also some few Species of the Serpent and Lizard
Kind.</P>
<P>There were but few <HI>Shells;</HI> but amongst them there was a
<HI>Murex</HI> (See <HI>T.</HI> 4.) which dies purple, with the Fish as it
exerts it self in the Sea. Also that Land <HI>Buccinum</HI> (see
<HI>Tab.</HI> 3.) which I have figured, and which lays Eggs with hard Shells,
and for bigness, and shape, and colour, scarce to be distinguisht
from the Sparrow Eggs. And because the <HI>Mu∣rex</HI> and this
<HI>Buccinum</HI> was drawn with the Animals creeping out, I desired a Copy
of them, which he freely and in a most obliging manner granted me; He
designed the <HI>Buccinum Terrestre</HI> in the Island of <HI>St.
Domingo,</HI> where he found it.</P>
<P>Amongst the vast Collection of Plants, I observed the Torch
Kind, and Fernes were of all others the most numerous; of each of which there
were an incredi∣ble number of Species. There were 2 or 3 Species of Goosberries
and Currants; and some Species of Wild Grapes; all <PB N="75" REF="44"/>which
<HI>F. Plumier</HI> told me were good to eat.</P>
<P>He told me these Drawings would make 10 Books, as big as that he
had publisht; and Two Books of Animals: He had been often at
<HI>Versailles</HI> to get them into the Kings <HI>Imprimerie;</HI> but as
yet un∣successfully; but hoped e're long to be∣gin the Printing of them.
Note, That the Booksellers at <HI>Paris</HI> are very unwil∣ling, or not able
to Print Natural Hi∣story; but all is done at the Kings Charge, and in his
Presses.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">M. <HI>Dacier.</HI></NOTE>I Visited Monsieur
<HI>Dacier and his Lady,</HI> two very obliging Persons, and both of great

<P>I think our Profession is much beholden to him, for his late

Learned Notes upon him. I wish he may live to finish what he hath so
happily begun. I read over the Two Volumes he has Print∣ed with great
delight.</P>
<P>He seems to favour the Opinion of those, who think, the
Circulation of the Blood was known to him; in which he errs undoubtedly. 'Tis
manifest his Ana∣tomy was rude, dark, and of little ex∣tent; but 'tis also
as manifest, that he knew very well the effect of the Circu∣lation. 
<PB N="76" REF="45"/>As for Example, 2. <HI>de Diaeta. c.</HI> 12. <HI>All the
Body</HI> (says he) <HI>is purged by Respi∣ration and Transpiration, and
what Humour thickens, is subtilized and thrown out by the Skin, and is called
Sweat.</HI></P>
<P>Again, 3. <HI>de Diaeta. c.</HI> 5. speaking of a sort of foul
and impure Bodies, he says, <HI>More is by Labour melted out of the Flesh,
than the Circular Motion (of the Blood) hath purged off.</HI> There are a great
number of Instances of this Nature. In Conversa∣tion I put this to him,
which he avowed was all he thought.</P>
<P>He told me he had two more Volumes ready for the Press, and did
intend not to give it over, till he had gone through all the Works of
<HI>Hippocrates.</HI> In which Volumes will be these Treatises: <HI>Of
Dreams: Of the Regimen in Acute Diseases: The Prognosticks: The
Prorrhetiques: The Aphorismes: The Coaques.</HI></P>
<P>On that <HI>Aphorism</HI> he seemed to me to have a very happy
thought, <HI>cocta non, sed cruda purganda sunt;</HI> which makes it of the
same sence with that other, <HI>Si quid movendum est, move in
principio.</HI></P>
<P>I must needs say this for <HI>Madam Da∣cier,</HI> his Wife,

weigh∣ed, as I remember, Eleven Pound odd Ounces; and was most perfectly

Correspondence this can hardly be done. And ours is certainly one of the

<P>I heard Mr. <HI>Oldenburgh</HI> say, who began this Noble
Register, that he held Corre∣spondence with 70 odd Persons in all parts
of the World, and those be sure with others: I askt him, what method he
used to answer so great variety of Subjects, and such a quantity of
Letters as he must receive weekly; for I knew he never failed, because I
had the Ho∣nour of his Correspondence for 10 or 12 years. He told me he made
one Letter answer another, and that to be always fresh, he never read a
Letter before he <PB N="79" REF="46"/>had Pen, Ink and Paper ready to answer
it forthwith, so that the multitude of his Letters cloy'd him not, or ever
lay upon his hands.</P>
<P>The <HI>Abbot Bignon</HI> is President, Ne∣phew to <HI>Monsieur
Pontchartrain.</HI> I was informed by some of them, that they have this great
advantage to incourage them in the pursuit of Natural Philoso∣phy, that if
any of the Members shall give in a Bill of Charges of any Expe∣riments which
he shall have made; or shall desire the Impression of any Book, and
bring in the Charges of Graving re∣quired for such Book, the President
al∣lowing it and signing it, the Money is forthwith reimbursed by the King.
As it was done in Dr. <HI>Turnfort</HI>'s <HI>Elements de Bo∣tanique,</HI> the
Cuts of that Book cost the King 12000 Livres. And the Cuts in∣tended, and now
Graving for another Book of new Plants found in his Voyages into
<HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> will cost 100<HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR>
Sterling.</HI></P>
<P>Also, if Monsieur <HI>Merrie,</HI> for Example, shall require
live Tortoises for the making good the Experiments about the Heart, they
shall be brought him, as many as he pleases, at the King's Charge.</P>
<P>These, besides their Pensions, I say, were some of the
Advantages they have <PB N="80" REF="47"/>injoyed; but the War, for this
Reason, has lain heavy upon the Philosophers too.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>But∣terfield.</HI></NOTE>Mr.
<HI>Butterfield</HI> is a right hearty honest <HI>Englishman,</HI> who has
resided in <HI>France</HI> 35 years, is a very excellent Artist in making
all sorts of Mathematical Instru∣ments, and works for the King and all the
Princes of the Blood, and his Work is sought after by all the Nations of
<HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia.</HI></P>
<P>He more than once shewed me (which is his great Diversion) a
mighty Collection of Loadstones, to the value of several Hundred Pounds
<HI>Sterling.</HI></P>
<P>Some he had as hard almost as Steel, and others soft and
friable; yet of these he had those which were of as great virtue, as any of
the hard; That of the equally hard there were very great difference.</P>
<P>He had one which weighed naked not above a Drachm, and would naked
take up a Drachm and an half; but shod would take up 144 Drachms of Iron, if
rightly applied, that is, if the Iron to be taken up did firmly and in a plain
touch alike both the Feet.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="47"/>The best Shod were these that follow.</P>
<P>1. A <HI>Slate Loadstone,</HI> which I noted not so much for its
strength, but be∣cause of its peculiar make, being fairly and distinctly
luminous throughout, weighing One ounce and an half, draws up One pound.</P>
<P>2. A Smooth Loadstone, weighing One drachm, two scruples,
fourteen grains, draws up Eighteen ounces, that is Eighty two times its
weight.</P>
<P>3. Another Smooth Loadstone, weigh∣ing Sixty five grains, draws up
Fourteen ounces, that is, One hundred and forty four times its weight.</P>
<P>There is, a Loadstone no bigger then a Hazel Nut, which took up a
huge Bunch of Keys.</P>
<P>We have a very large Slate Loadstone in the Repository at
<HI>Gresham-Colledge,</HI> at least 6 inches over; This also is but weak;
Whether the <HI>Laminae</HI> do spoil the vertue, as though they were but
so many distinct Stones packt together. And yet a Loadstone which takes
up <HI>ex. gr.</HI> 6 pound weight, cut by the Axis in two halves, and both
halves shod again, will take up 8 pound.</P>
<P>It is plain, that Experiments are bet∣ter made with a
<HI>Terrella,</HI> or spherical Load∣stone, than a square one; and his
way <PB N="82" REF="48"/>of capping the <HI>Terrella</HI> is very well
con∣trived.</P>
<P>A square Loadstone made into a <HI>Ter∣rella,</HI> will near
take up as much weight as it did before, though a great deal of the Stone is
lost in the rounding, by virtue of the different shooing.</P>
<P>He entertained us full two hours with Experiments neatly contrived
about the effects of the Loadstone.</P>
<P>The Experiment of approaching a Load∣stone to the Spring of a
Watch is very fine; it causes the Ballance to move very swift, and brought
yet nearer, to stop quite and cease moving.</P>
<P>Another Experiment was an inch broad Plate of Iron, turned into a
Ring of about 4 inches diameter, which had evi∣dently two North and two South
Poles, which he said he had seen in a Loadstone, and had contrived this
in imitation of Nature. The working of them with fi∣lings of Steel, drigged
upon a Plate, set upon the Ring, did clearly manifest the double
Polarity.</P>
<P>Also the suspending of a Needle in the Air, and a Ball of
Steel upon the point of it, by a Thred, which a weight kept down, that it could
not ascend higher, than such a distance within the sphere of the
activity of the Loadstone.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="48"/>Again, the free working of the Needle in Water,
through Brass, Gold, Stone, Wood, or any thing but Iron. He told us, he had a
Stone, which would work through a Stone Wall of 18 inches.</P>
<P>Lastly, he demonstrated by many Ex∣periments, how the
<HI>Effluvia</HI> of the Load∣stone work in a Circle, that is, what flows
from the North Pole, comes round, and enters the South Pole; on the con∣trary,
what flows from the South Pole, enters the North, and in its way puts in order
all such Filings of Steel it meets with; that is, according to the
dispositi∣on of its own whirling, and the circular lines it keeps in its
flying about the Load∣stone. Indeed, it is pleasant to see, how the Steel
Filings are disposed; and in their arangement one clearly sees a per∣fect
image of the road, which the whirl∣ing invisible Matter takes in coming
forth, and re-entring the Poles of the Load∣stone.</P>
<P>He shewed us a Loadstone sawed off that piece of the Iron Bar,
which held the Stones together at the very top of the Steeple of
<HI>Chartres;</HI> This was a thick Crust of Rust, part of which was turned
into a strong Loadstone, and had all the properties of a Stone dug out of
the Mine. <HI>Mans. de la Hire</HI> has Printed a <PB N="84" REF="49"/>Memoire
of it; also Mons. <HI>de Vallemont</HI> a Treatise. The very outward
Rust had no Magnetic Virtue, but the inward had a strong one, as to take up
a third part more than its weight unshod. This Iron had the very grain of a
solid Magnet, and the brittleness of a Stone.</P>
<P>These Gentlemen, who have writ of this, have, in my Opinion,
miss'd their purpose, when they enquire, how it comes to pass to be thus
turned; for it is certain, all Iron will in time go back into its Mineral
Nature again, notwith∣standing the Artifice of Melting and Hammering. I have
seen of those Ham∣mered <HI>Spanish</HI> Cannon, which had lain many
years buried in the Ground, under the old Fort at <HI>Hull</HI> in
<HI>Yorkeshire,</HI> which were thoroughly turned into brittle Iron Stone, or
Mine again; and would not own the Loadstone, no more than the rest of our
<HI>English</HI> Iron Mine, till it was calcined, and then shewed it self
to be good Iron again. Also I have seen, and had by me, a piece of Wood
taken out of <HI>Lough-Neagh</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> which was not only good
Iron Mine, but a Loadstone too; so that it is evident, Nature, in this
sort of Mine, goes backwards and for∣wards, is generated and regenerated; and
therefore Mons. <HI>de la Hire</HI> has well <PB N="85" REF="49"/>used the
Term of Vegetation in this Affair, which I had done many years be∣fore in my
Book <HI>De Fontibus Medicatis Angliae,</HI> that is, out of Iron, Mine will
grow; and out of Mine, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Loadstone; as in the petrified Wood.</P>
<P>I do not relate these things, as though they were new Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>veries; the World has long since

Hypo∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>s to solve these
Phoenomena. A <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1+ letters" DISP="•…"/>chman,</HI> Mr.
<HI>Hartsoeker,</HI> one of the <HI>A∣cademy des Sciences,</HI> has
published a Trea∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se of the
Principles of Natural Philo∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>phy,
and has accounted for these and many more Experiments of this Nature, which
he had shewn him by Mr. <HI>Butter∣field,</HI> whom he mentions very
Honour∣ably.</P>
<P>And yet after all, the nature of these <HI>Effluvia</HI> are
little known, and what is said by <HI>Des Cartes</HI> of Screw fashioned
Particles, and the invisible Channels and Pores and Pipes of the Loadstone,
are all meer Fancies without any Founda∣tion in Nature. It is well called by
some a certain Magnetick Matter, but <PB N="86" REF="50"/>what properties it
hath, is little under∣stood.</P>
<P>It is very strange to me, that a little Loadstone, of that
prodigious force, should have so short a sphere of activity, and not
sensibly to affect Iron above an inch or two; and the biggest and
strong∣est not above a foot or two. We see the Vortices in Water, how
wide they work round about them, vastly increas∣ing the Circles; and what
little resi∣stance the Air can make to a body of that subtilty, as the
<HI>Effluvia</HI> of the Load∣stone, which can with ease penetrate all
Bodies whatsoever, Marble, Flints, Glass, Copper, Gold, without any
sensible di∣minution of its virtue. Again, we see the Flame of a Lamp in
Oil, or Tallow, or Wax, how short it is; and how long and tapering it is in
Spirit of Wine. If therefore the Magnetick Matter was darted out of infinite
small Pipes, and was of the nature of a more subtile and invisible Flame,
why does it not conti∣nue its course in a direct line to a great length, but
return so suddenly? We see the perspiration of our Skins to rise into
the Air, and continue to mount which yet has but a weak impulse from the
Heart, being interrupted and broke off, when it comes out of the Road of the 
<PB N="87" REF="50"/>Blood into the <HI>Ductus Excretorii.</HI> But the Circle
of the Magnetick Matter is without any impulse, that we know of, from the
Stone; and moves in a double circle, and with a double and contrary stream in
the same Pipes, contrary to the Laws of the Circulation of the Blood in
Animals; which has naturally but one Currant, and one Road round; for the whole
Mass of Vessels, in which the Circulation of the Blood is concerned, is
but one continued Pipe.</P>
<P>Until the Nature of the <HI>Effluvia</HI> is bet∣ter known, no very
satisfactory Account can be given of the most common Phoe∣nomena of the
Loadstone, <HI>ex. gr.</HI> why it does not draw to it all Bodies alike? why
a great Loadstone, though weak, extends its vertue much farther, than a
small one, though strong? Why a Load∣stone communicates its vertue to
Iron, as soon as it touches it, nay even at some distance, and gives it
the properties of a Loadstone.</P>
<P>The Truth is, the Earth's being a great Magnet seems to me a meer
Vision and Fable; for this reason, because it is not Iron. 'Tis true,
Iron Mine is the most common of all Minerals, and found al∣most in all
places; but it holds not any proportion with the rest of the Fossils of 
<PB N="88" REF="51"/>the Earth; and is not, at a guess, as a million to other
Fossils; This seems evi∣dent to any one, who has well consider∣ed the
Chalky Mountains and Cliffs, the high Rag-stone Mountains and Lime Stone
Cliffs, the several Quarries and Pits sunk in∣to the Bowels of the Earth
for Coal, and Lead, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> how little Iron there is to be found in
comparison of other Matters. Add to this, that very little of that very Iron
Mine, which is to be found any where, is Magnetick, or capable of obe∣dience to
the Magnet, till it is calcined: Whence therefore should all those
Magne∣tick <HI>Effluvia</HI> arise, which are supposed every where
plentifully to incompass the Earth? And why should they be sup∣posed to
be every where wandring in the Air, since 'tis evident, they make haste to
return to the Stone that emitted them, and are as afraid to leave it, as the
Child the Mother before it can go?</P>
<P>Towards the discovery of the Nature of the <HI>Effluvia</HI> of
the Loadstone, such Particulars as those, in my Opinion, ought chiefly to
be considered, and pro∣secuted with all industry. The Load∣stone is
very good, if not the best Iron Mine. The sole Fusion of the Loadstone
turns it into Iron; The Fire destroys its very virtue, and so does
Vitrification <PB N="89" REF="51"/>Iron. Fire will make Iron Mine own the
Loadstone, and turn to a Magnet; Rust, (into which all Iron will naturally
turn) and the reduction of Iron again to its Mine, will take away all the
Mag∣netick capacity of Iron. A Loadstone cannot be made to alter its Poles,
but Iron may; nor be destroyed, but by the Fire. A great and long Bar of Iron
is naturally a Loadstone, if held up perpen∣dicularly, and it changes its
Poles at the pleasure of him that holds it: A strong Loadstone loses
much of its virtue by touching Iron, but after a few days re∣covers it again: A
small and weak Load∣stone cannot touch to give its virtue to a great lump
of Iron: A Loadstone ex∣posed to the Air is spoilt in time: The deeper
the Vein of Iron Mine is, where Loadstone is found, the better the Stone, and
how far, this holds true; for I do not doubt, but a very hard Stone may be
found near the day, as well as deeper: A Ruler or long Plate of Steel is much
better touched with the virtue of the Loadstone, than a Plate of meer Iron of
the same figure; but on the contrary a Plate of Iron sticks much faster
to the Loadstone, than a Plate of Steel; so as if a Loadstone draws up a
Plate of Steel of 3 Ounces, it will draw up a Plate of <PB N="90" REF="52"/>Iron
of four Ounces and more. Why Iron fastned to the Poles of a Magnet does so
vastly improve its strength, as to be 150 times stronger than when
Naked.</P>
<P>Since therefore a Loadstone is nothing else but good Iron Mine,
and may be turned into Iron; and Iron most easily, and of its self into
Load-Stone, the way to find out the Nature of those <HI>Magnetick
Effluvia,</HI> seems to be to enquire strictly into the Na∣ture of Iron
Mine, and Iron it self; and not to run giddily into Hypotheses, before we
are well stocked with the Natural History of the Load-Stone, and a larger
quantity of Experiments and Observati∣ons relating to Iron and its Mine, with
all the Difference and Species of them; which I think has hitherto been little
heeded. For Nature will be its own In∣terpreter, in this, as well as in all
other Matters of Natural Philosophy.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Butterfield,</HI> in another Conversa∣tion, told me, He
had observed Load-Stones, which were strong without arm∣ing; and being
armed, had not that great advantage by it, as one could have expected: And that
on the contrary, there were others, which had a more incredible Virtue when
armed, than they did promise.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="52"/>That it seldom happens, that a Load-Stone hath
as much Virtue in one of its Poles, as in the other; and that a bit of Iron is
toucht equally well at either of the Poles of one and the same
Load-Stone.</P>
<P>That there are Load-Stones which take up much, and which
notwithstanding are incapable of well touching Iron; so that a Stone armed,
which takes up seven Pound, yet cannot Communicate to a Ruler of Iron, the
Virtue of taking up a very small Needle.</P>
<P>That a Load-Stone of 10 Ounces, be∣ing reduced to the weight of 6
Ounces or thereabouts, did almost the same effect as before,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I caused Mr. <HI>Butterfield</HI> to make the <HI>Slate
Load-Stone</HI> into a <HI>Terella,</HI> and when shod, it was indeed but of
little force; but I observed its Poles to lie level with the
<HI>Laminae,</HI> of which it was composed.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> A strong Load-Stone ought to have large Irons, and
a weak one but thin Irons; so that a Stone may be over-shod.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">M. <HI>Gua∣nieres.</HI></NOTE>I waited upon the

His Memoires, Manuscripts, Paintings, <PB N="92" REF="53"/>and Stamps are
infinite, but the method in which he disposes them, is very par∣ticular and
useful. He shewed his <HI>Porte∣seiulles</HI> in Folio, of Red Spanish
Leather finely adorned: In one, for Example, He had the General Maps of

<HI>Europe</HI> by themselves.</P>
<P>His Rooms are filled with the Heads of a vast number of Men of
Note in Oil Paintings, and Miniatures or Water-Co∣lours: Amongst the rest,
an Original of King <HI>John,</HI> who was Prisoner in <HI>England,</HI>
which he greatly values.</P>
<P>He shewed us the Habits in Limning from the Originals, done by the
best Masters, of all the Kings and Queens and Princes of <HI>France,</HI>
for many Ages back∣wards. Also the Turnaments and Just∣ings at large; and a
thousand such things of Monuments.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="53"/>He was so Curious, that he told me, he
seldom went into the Country with∣out an <HI>Amanuensis,</HI> and a couple

<P>He shewed us amongst other curious Manuscripts, a Capitularie

<P>One Toy I took notice of, which was a Collection of Playing Cards

Mortification, to see the sad De∣cays of Nature in a Woman once so
famous. To hear her Talk, with her <PB N="94" REF="54"/>Lips hanging about a
Toothless Mouth, and not to be able to Command her Words from flying abroad
at Random, puts me in mind of the <HI>Sybil</HI>'s uttering Oracles. Old Women
were employed on this Errand, and the Infant-World thought nothing so Wise,
as Decayed Nature, or Nature quite out of Order; and preferred Dreams before
reasonable and waking Thoughts.</P>
<P>She shewed me the Skeletons of two <HI>Chameleons,</HI> which
she had kept near four years alive: In Winter she lodged them in Cotton;
and in the fiercest Weather, she put them under a Ball of Copper, full of

they might expect something more from him, he expressed a great desire
to have the whole Sett of the <HI>Philosophic Transactions</HI> brought
over, and many other Books, which he named, but had not yet seen. He told me,
it was not possible for them to continue the Month∣ly Memoirs, as they had
done for two years only, because they were but very few in number of that
Society, and had very little Correspondence. Indeed, I did inquire once of
some of that Body, why they did not take in more since there were very many
deserving Men in the City, as I instanc'd in <HI>F. Plumier:</HI> They
owned he would be an Honour to the Body, but they avoided to make a

That he had seen and described the Con∣tents of more Cabinets, than any Man
ever did before him; and it is evident by his Works, that he has made good
use of them.</P>
<P>I had a Visit from Mr. <HI>Conningham,</HI> Tutor to my Lord
<HI>Lorne,</HI> a very Learn∣ed and Curious Man in Books. I askt him (knowing
him to have been lately at <HI>Rome</HI>) very particularly about the Pa∣pers
of Monsieur <HI>d'Azout.</HI> He told me, that he see him not above half a
year before he died, and was very intimately acquainted with him, and saw him
for a Twelvemonth very often. That he told him, that he had about 80 difficult
Pas∣sages in <HI>Vitruvius,</HI> which he had Com∣mented and Explained; and
the Corre∣ction of a great number of <HI>Errata</HI> in the Text. Also that
upon <HI>Julius Frontinus</HI> (though that was a much less Book) he had much
more to say, than he had upon <HI>Vitruvius:</HI> What is become of his
Papers I could not learn from him, nor any in <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="57"/>Monsieur <HI>d'Azout</HI> was very Curious
and Understanding in Architecture, for which purpose he was 17 years in
<HI>Italy</HI> by times; I do remember when he was in <HI>England</HI> about 14
years ago, he shewed me the Design of several of our Build∣ings drawn by
himself; but of that of the <HI>Banquetting-House</HI> at
<HI>Whitehall,</HI> he expres∣sed himself in very extraordinary Terms,
telling me, it was the most Regular, and most Finisht Piece of Modern
Workman∣ship he had seen on this side the <HI>Alpes,</HI> that he could
not enough praise it: That <HI>Inigo Jones,</HI> the Architect, had a true
re∣lish of what was Noble in that Art.</P>
<P>It is time now to leave the Private Houses, and to Visit the
<HI>Publick Libraries;</HI> and with them such Persons as are more
particularly concerned in the History of Learning.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">M. <HI>l'Abbe Drouine.</HI></NOTE>Monsieur
<HI>l'Abbe Drouine</HI> came to visit me at my Lodgings. I returned the
Visit the next day at his Appartment in the College <HI>de Boncourt.</HI> He
had 4 or 5 little Rooms well furnisht with Books; in the biggest he had a
Collection of Catalogues of Books, and of all such who had writ the Accounts
of Authors; above 3000 in all Languages. He told me he had studied the
History of Books with the <PB N="101" REF="57"/>utmost application 18 years,
and had brought his <HI>Memoirs</HI> into a good Method; That he had thoughts
of Printing the first Tome this year, which would be of the most ancient
Authors, <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>La∣tin;</HI> That he intended to continue them
throughout all the succeeding Ages down to our times; which he said he had
per∣formed in good part.</P>
<P>He shewed me the Catalogue of Au∣thors in 4 very thick
<HI>Folio's;</HI> alphabeti∣cally disposed by <HI>Family Names,</HI> under
some such Title as this: <HI>Index alphabeticus omnium Scriptorum,
cujuscunque facultatis temporis, &amp; linguae:</HI> Those came to about
150000.</P>
<P>He also shewed me his Alphabetick Memoirs in Sheets of the
Authors and Books they had writ, and in great for∣wardness. And lastly, the
Chronologi∣cal Catalogue, in which form he intends to Print the whole.</P>
<P>He is a very Civil and well Tempered Person, very Learned and
Curious, and of a middle Age, fit to continue and fi∣nish such a Laborious
Work. I was in∣finitely obliged to him for his frequent Visits.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="58"/><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thevenot</HI>'s
Library.</NOTE>I was to wait on Monsieur <HI>Gurnier,</HI> one of the Heirs
of Monsieur <HI>Thevenot,</HI> to see the Remains of that Famous Man's
Li∣brary. There are a great number of <HI>O∣riental</HI> MSS. yet unsold.</P>
<P>He shewed me the MS. of <HI>Abulfeda,</HI> with its <HI>Latin</HI>
Version, done by Monsieur <HI>Thevenot;</HI> and the <HI>Matrices and Forms
of Arabick Letters,</HI> which he had, at his own Charge, caused to be cut
for the Printing of certain proper Names in it.</P>
<P>He went or designed to go into <HI>Eng∣land</HI> and
<HI>Holland</HI> to get it Printed, but was called back by Monsieur
<HI>Louvois</HI>'s Order, to Print it in <HI>France</HI> at the King's Charge;
but the late Wars coming on, it was set aside, and is like to be so, for
he was turned out of his place of Library Keeper to the King, and died in
Dis∣grace.</P>
<P>Those great number of Oriental Books he had most from his
Nephew, whom he sent abroad for that purpose, and who died in his
Travels.</P>
<P>This Man was, as it were, the Foun∣der of the <HI>Academie des
Sciences,</HI> and was in his own Nature very Liberal, and gave Pensions to
many Scholars.</P>
<P>Amongst other things, I saw there a large Dictionary and Grammar
of the <PB N="103" REF="58"/><HI>Algonquin Tongue,</HI> one of the Nations of
the <HI>West-Indies.</HI> The Fugitive Jesuit, who writ it, dwelt amongst
them 20 years. Here it also saw a History, with large and accurate
Descriptions of the <HI>Quadrupeds</HI> of that part of the
<HI>West-Indies</HI> by the same Author.</P>
<P>As for the Papers of <HI>Swammerdam,</HI> which indeed were the
things I most coveted to see, they were much beneath my Expectati∣on, not
answering the Printed Catalogue of <HI>Thevenot, p.</HI> 239. There were,
in∣deed, some Corrections of the Figures of his general History of
Insects, and some Additions, as though he intended ano∣ther Edition of that
Book.</P>
<P>Also towards a particular History, there were some small
Treatises, or ra∣ther some Figures only of the <HI>Tadpole.</HI> Again,
Figures relating to the Natural History of a certain <HI>Day Butterfly;</HI>
Of the <HI>Asilus;</HI> Of the <HI>Scuttle Fish;</HI> Of the <HI>Scarabaeus
Nasicornis;</HI> and some consider∣able number of <HI>Snails,</HI> as
well naked, as fluviatil, and Sea dissected; at least fi∣gured with their
Bodies exerted, and some of their Bowels extracted; and which seemed to me
to be well under∣stood and delineated. There were 2 or 3 Stitcht Books in
<HI>Dutch</HI> of 4 or 5 Sheets a-piece belonging to those Plates or
Fi∣gures. <PB N="104" REF="59"/>But the Gentleman would not part with any of
them; because, he said, they had been secured by the <HI>Abbot
Big∣non</HI> for the Kings use. However, all these I judge well worth
Printing, when it shall please that <HI>Society</HI> to do it.</P>
<P>Lastly, I saw in his Custody a fair MS. of <HI>Michael
Servetus,</HI> with a Treatise at the end of it, which, as he said, was
never publisht; being a Comparison of the Jewish and Christian Law, its
Justice and Charity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kings' Li∣bary.</NOTE>Mons. <HI>l'Abbe de
Brillac,</HI> Almoner to the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> very obligingly offered
to carry me to the <HI>Kings Library;</HI> but I Civilly declined it, for I had
been told, it was better to make Visits by ones self: for no Stranger but
was very welcome, at all times; not only on the days it was publickly open, as
it is upon <HI>Tuesdays</HI> and <HI>Fridays.</HI></P>
<P>Mons. <HI>Clemènt,</HI> the Deputy Library Keeper, made us
welcome, and invited us to come again, and spend a whole day with him: He
made me in particular a very great Compliment, as a considerable Benefactor
to that place, shewing me most of the Books and the Names of the rest, I
had publisht in <HI>Latin;</HI> and shewed a great satisfaction, that he
had got the <PB N="105" REF="59"/><HI>Synopsis Conchyliorum,</HI> which he had
caused to be Bound very elegantly. I told him, that I was very sorry to
see it there, and wondered how he came by it; for it was, I assured him,
but a very imperfect trial of the Plates, which I had disposed of to some
few Friends only, till I should be able to close and finish the Design;
which I now had done to my power, and would redeem that Book with a bet∣ter
Copy at my return into <HI>England:</HI> The same Promise I renewed to the
<HI>Abbe Louvois,</HI> the Library Keeper, at his own Instance, when I had
the Honour to Dine with him. This young Gentleman is Brother to Monsieur
<HI>Barbisieux,</HI> Inten∣dant of the Affairs of War; he takes great care to
apply himself to his Studies, and for that purpose has two of the Sor∣bone
constantly with him to instruct him. He lives great, and has a House
which joins upon the King's Library, of which he is Keeper. We were Entertained
by him with all the Civility imaginable, and freedom of Conversation.</P>
<P>This Library is now placed in a Private House, and taken out of
the <HI>Louvre,</HI> but it is intended to be removed to the <HI>Place de
Vendosme,</HI> where one side of that Magni∣sicent Square is designed
for it. In the mean time it is here most commodiously <PB N="106" REF="60"/>dispos'd into 22 Rooms; 14 above Stairs, and 8 below and above.
Those below are Philosophy and Physick, and the Shelves are Wired, to
secure them: Above are the Books of Philosophy and Human Learn∣ing; and it
is into those Rooms only the promiscous Crowd are admitted twice a week. In
the middle Rooms, which makes the great Body of the Library, are, for Example,
Catalogues of Books; Hi∣stories in one of <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>Holland;</HI> in another the Histories of <HI>France</HI> and
<HI>Germany;</HI> in another the Histories of <HI>Italy, Spain, &amp;c.</HI>
in other Bibles of all sorts, and the Interpretations; in another <HI>Greek
MSS.</HI> in another <HI>Latin MSS.</HI> in ano∣ther the Civil and Municipial
Laws of all Nations; in another the Original Papers of State; in another
<HI>Stamps,</HI> where, by the by, the King had the Collection of Mons.
<HI>Marolles</HI> to divert him, in one of his Sicknesses, bought in at a
vast Sum: The Catalogue alone of these Stamps, no big∣ger than two small
Almanacks, cost me 14 Livres; so much Strangers are im∣posed upon by the
Crafty Booksellers of <HI>Rue St. Jaques;</HI> but 'tis not in
<HI>France</HI> a∣lone, where People are made to pay for their Humour.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="60"/>They have Two Indexes of this Libra∣ry; one
relating to the Matter and Con∣tents of Books; and another Index of Authors,
wherein are all the Works they have of them, and the Titles of all like∣wise
that they know of, that are want∣ing, with an <HI>Asterism</HI> to such
in the Mar∣gent; which is well done, that they may know what they have to buy
in. It is indeed a vast Collection, and worthy so great a Prince. This
Library consists at least of 50000 Volumes of Printed Books; and 15000
MSS. in all Languages.</P>
<P>They work daily and hard at the Ca∣talogue, which they intend to
Print; I saw 10 thick Folio's of it, fairly tran∣scrib'd for the Press.
It is disposed ac∣cording to the Subject Matter of the Books, as the Bibles
and Expositors, Hi∣storians, Philosophers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They
pur∣pose to put it into the Press this years, and to finish it within a
Twelvemonth.</P>
<P>In the King's Library I was shewn an Ancient <HI>Greek MS. of
Dioscorides,</HI> writ in a sort of thin or narrow Capitals, with the
Plants painted in Water-co∣lours; but the first Book was wholly wanting, and
therefore the <HI>Animals</HI> not there, which yet was what I most desired
to see; for there are some things relat∣ing to them, which we are at this
day in <PB N="108" REF="61"/>great doubt of; and it would have been some
satisfaction to have seen by the Pictures, what the middle Ages, at
least, had thought of them.</P>
<P>In the same Room also we were shewn the Epistles; which was
one part of the same MS. which we have at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> which is the
Gospels only. <HI>Beza</HI> was possessed of ours, from whom we had
it. It is written in <HI>square Capitals,</HI> and very short Lines, and
much worn out in ma∣ny places. This comes much short of the
<HI>Alexandrian</HI> MS. at <HI>St. James's</HI> for Beauty and Antiquity.</P>
<P>There was another <HI>MS. of the Gospel of St. Matthew,</HI> which
was but of late dis∣covered; a very fair Volume in a large Folio. This was
cut to pieces in the back, and had been shuffled and bound up again; and
another Book overwritten in a small Modern <HI>Greek</HI> Hand, about 150
years ago. The first Writing was turned so pale, that they took no pains to
rub it out. One of the Library Keep∣ers observing this, hath reduced it again
by paging it a-new; and with a little heeding 'tis yet very legible. The Letter
is as fair a square Capital as any I have seen. There are some
Interpretations ve∣ry notorious, as about the Descent of the sick Man into
the Pool of <HI>Bethesda;</HI> <PB N="109" REF="61"/>which I suppose will
be accounted for by the Industrious and Learned Collator.</P>
<P>I observed the <HI>China</HI> Manuscripts which Father
<HI>Beauvais</HI> brought this year as a Present to the King. They are about
44 Packs of small Books, of a long Quarto fashion, put up in loose Covers
of a Pur∣ple Sattin glued on Pastboard; of Natu∣ral History, of
Dictionaries relating to the Exposition of their Characters,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The King had a Sett much of the same before in White-Sattin, with
their Ti∣tles.</P>
<P>Here also I see the 3d Decade of <HI>Livy,</HI> a large Quarto
in Vellum, without Di∣stinction of Words in fair large Capitals. It is
supposed by Monsieur <HI>Baluze</HI> to be 1100 year old.</P>
<P>Yet the Manuscript of <HI>Prudentius Hym∣nes,</HI> which was
also shewed us, is a much fairer Letter, and therefore thought to be older
by one Century at least.</P>
<P>Here also I saw a famous <HI>Latin Roll</HI> or Volume written
of Aegyptian Paper, In∣tituled, <HI>Charta Plenariae Securitatis,</HI> taken
the 38th years of <HI>Justinian;</HI> it is fanly Ingraved and Interpreted
Letter by Letter upon Copper by <HI>Monsieur Thevenot.</HI> I saw the Print
thereof: It is writ long∣ways the Roll and not cross; in three Columns: The
Column in the middle is <PB N="110" REF="62"/>three times as long as the two end
Co∣lumns. The Roll is not above a foot broad.</P>
<P>They shewed us also in this House, the Apartment of Monsieur
<HI>Hugeins,</HI> which was very Noble, and well for Air, upon the Garden: But
here he fell Melanchol∣ly, and Died of it in <HI>Holland.</HI> He shewed the
first Tokens of it by playing with a Tame Sparrow, and neglecting his
Ma∣thematick Schemes. 'Tis certain, Life and Health of Body and Mind are not to
be preserved but by the Relaxation, and un∣bending the Mind by Innocent
Diversions. For Sleep is nothing else that I know off, but the giving up
the Reins, and letting Nature to Act alone, and to put her in full
possession of the Body. We have a convincing instance of this, in
being a Bed awake: No Man can lie still 3 Mi∣nutes without turning; and if it
come not presently upon us, we must turn a∣gain and again; and at length we
be∣come so intolerably weary, that our Bed is a very wrack to us. Whereas, if
we chance to fall a sleep, though we lie in one and the same posture 7
hours, we shall Wake fresh and without pain, as tho' the Body did not weigh
at all upon it self in Sleep. 'Tis certain, the Nerves and Muscles are in
little or no Tension <PB N="111" REF="62"/>in Sleep; but when we are awake,
are always stretch'd and compressed, whence weariness: which, if upon
our Feet or Sitting, we are not sensible off, because we remove quick and
with ease, and of course; but laid, we soon find our selves very
uneasie, till we change the posture.</P>
<P>But this is not all in the King's Library: There are other things to
be seen, <HI>viz.</HI> A considerable number of Ancient Roman and Aegyptian
Antiquities; as, <HI>Lamps, Pateras,</HI> and other Vessels belonging to
the Sacrifices; A <HI>Sistrum</HI> or Aegyptian Rattle with three loose and
running Wires cross it.</P>
<P>Amongst the great variety of <HI>Aegyptian Idols,</HI> there was
one betwixt 2 and 3 foot long of Black Touch-stone, with Hiero∣glyphicks
ingraven down before. I took particular notice of the Grain of this Stone; and
at my return, having had the Honour of a Paper from Mr. <HI>Molyneux</HI> from
<HI>Dublin,</HI> giving an account of the vast and stupendious <HI>Natural
Pillars</HI> to be seen in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that the Stones or Joints
which constitute these Pillars, are of the <HI>Lapis Lydius,</HI> or
<HI>Basaltes</HI> Kind, ha∣ving seen one of the Joints at
<HI>Gresham-Colledge,</HI> I easily agree with him; but much admire, that
the <HI>Peble Kind</HI> should produce such regular Figures; which is
cer∣tainly <PB N="112" REF="63"/>the very hardest Stone to be found in
<HI>Europe,</HI> and which no Tool of ours will cut.</P>
<P>This also is another Instance (the carved Oblisks being one) of
the diffe∣rent make and goodness of the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Chisels, of
which, and of the retrieving the ancient Temper of Steel, I have pub∣lisht a
Discourse in the <HI>Ph. Transactions</HI> some years ago.</P>
<P>I should have had more satisfaction in this Kind, had I met with
what I ear∣nestly sought for, the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Tombs, which were a
long time in the Garden of Monsieur <HI>Valentine</HI> at <HI>Paris;</HI> but
were un∣luckily sent away to his House at <HI>Tours,</HI> not long before
our coming to <HI>Paris:</HI> One of these Tombs is said to be of black
Touchstone, to have been brought out of the higher <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and to be
full of <HI>Hie∣rogliphicks.</HI> Of this in particular <HI>Kircher</HI> has
written.</P>
<P>There is in this Collection a large Piece of <HI>Tin Oar</HI> from
<HI>England,</HI> very curious; it has on one side of it a great number of
fair and large Opaque Crystals of Tin, shin∣ing like polisht Steel: The
<HI>plaines</HI> of those Crystals I could not easily reckon, but sure
I am, having with care examined all the Stone Crystals, I could meet with,
both precious and more common, and <PB N="113" REF="63"/>also the Crystals
of all Fossil Salts, I ne∣ver before observed that figure in any of them,
but believe them of a peculiar na∣ture, proper to Tin Oar. I call them
Crystals, though Opaque, because angu∣lar and of one constant figure.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P. Har∣douin.</HI></NOTE>I was at the
Colledge of <HI>Clermont</HI> with <HI>Pere Hardouin;</HI> he shewed me the
Library with great Civility; it consists of two long Galleries; The
Galleries are well furnisht with Books, having Lights only on one side, and
the Windows are not over large; with Tables under each Light, very
commodiously placed for Writing and Reading. Also certain Closets for
Manuscripts, and others for forbidden Books. In this he shewed a great
Col∣lection of <HI>Jansenius</HI>'s Original Letters. In the other a Greek
manuscript of the Prophets, of <HI>Eusebius</HI>'s own Hand Writ∣ing; it
was in Capitals, but of a diffe∣rent Character from any I had seen; The
Letters very erect, but something thinner, and not so square.</P>
<P>Also a Vulgar <HI>Latin</HI> in Capitals, very Ancient.</P>
<P>I told him I was well pleased with his <HI>Plinie in usum
Delphini;</HI> and that it was to the Honour of the French Nation to have
laboured more particularly upon that <PB N="114" REF="64"/>Author;
<HI>Delachampius</HI> first, then <HI>Salma∣sius's Exercitationes
Plinianae;</HI> and lastly, this his most Elegant Edition.</P>
<P>The Books are well disposed under Gilt Titles, as <HI>Medici in
Folio,</HI> and over-against them, where the Windows will permit, the
<HI>Medici in Quarto;</HI> in the o∣ther Galley runs a Balustrade, within
which are plac't the <HI>Octavo's</HI> and <HI>Twelves.</HI></P>
<P>At one end of the upper Gallery is a very large Tableau, an Original
of <HI>Ni∣colo,</HI> of the Massacer of <HI>Agamenon;</HI> in it there is
this commendable, That in such a horrid Fury, and such variety of Mur∣ders
in half naked Figures, no one inde∣cent posture is to be seen.</P>
<P><HI>Pere Hardouin</HI> seemed to doubt of the <HI>Inscription of
Palmyra</HI> put out by M. <HI>Spone;</HI> That the <HI>Greek</HI> was faulty,
and the <HI>Syriac</HI> very questionable. I told him we had had it lately
Copied, carefully and truly by one at <HI>Rome;</HI> Which took away his
Ob∣jection of the multiplicity of Letters.</P>
<P>Both he and <HI>Valliant</HI> agreed, that they had never seen any
Medal of <HI>Odenatus.</HI> He very obligingly answered my Memoir about
<HI>Palmyra, Zenobia,</HI> and <HI>Vabalathus,</HI> with a Transcript of all
the Coins he had seen, and had in his possession; which follows.</P>

and well furnisht with Books, on the very top of the House: They find, that
Books keep much drier and sweeter there, than in lower Rooms, besides the
advantage of a clear Sky-light.</P>
<P><HI>P. Daniel</HI> is Library Keeper; and was very Civil to me; he
shewed me a Letter, which he had just then received from Mons.
<HI>Huetius,</HI> the Learned Bishop of <HI>d'Auranches</HI> near <HI>Mont
St. Michaels</HI> in <HI>Nor∣mandy;</HI> wherein he told him, that ha∣ving
lately received the Catalogues of Books Printed in <HI>Holland</HI> and

kind of stand in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>France;</HI> but, that it had yet
life and vigour in <HI>England,</HI> which he re∣joiced at.</P>
<P>And, indeed, I had had the same thought from more of the French
before. Even the Jesuits themselves will be little considered, if
Learning fall into neglect and disgrace. Oratory ceased with the
Commonwealth of <HI>Rome;</HI> and so will all sorts of Learning without
Emulation and Rewards.</P>

the Quire of the Abbey of <HI>St. Germains,</HI> and the Altar near the lower

the Quire of <HI>St. John</HI>'s Church at <HI>Lions;</HI> both plain Tables.
Mons. <HI>l'Abbe de Vil∣liers,</HI> who has an Apartment in the Con∣vent, a

Galleries well furnisht; at the end of one of them is a large Closet of
Ma∣nuscripts; also another <HI>Armoir</HI> in the great Library, where the
most ancient <PB N="118" REF="66"/>Manuscripts are kept, yet with more care.
In this I saw the <HI>Psalter,</HI> as it is believed, of <HI>St.
Germain,</HI> who lived in the 6th Century; it is certainly very an∣cient;
being a large Quarto of fine purple Velom, and on it are writ the
<HI>Psalms</HI> in large Capital Letters, with Comma's or Points. The Letters
seem to have been of Silver; and the great Initial Capitals of Gold.</P>
<P>They shew also a <HI>Psalter</HI> in the short Notes of
<HI>Tyro, Tullius</HI>'s <HI>Libertus;</HI> with a Discourse concerning the
use of such Short Hand in the beginning of the Ma∣nuscript; it was writ
very fair on Ve∣lom, with red Ink, as I remember.</P>
<P>The Codicils or Waxen Table Books of the Ancients; which were thin
Ce∣dar Boards about 14 inches long, and 5 broad, 6 or 8 of them glued together
by Shreds of Parchmen; The Rims were a little raised, with a flat and broad
Bor∣der, the better to preserve the black Wax, which was spread over them.
I saw more of these afterwards in the King's Library; and by the Letter it
is manifest, they were in use much later, than I could have imagined. This
here was in <HI>Latin,</HI> and I could read here and there a Word, for the
ground was much torn up, as <HI>Pro duobus Falconibus, &amp;c.</HI> The Style
or Steel <PB N="119" REF="66"/>Pen had cut through in many places; so that
with a good Eye-glass I could see the board bare. I take this past to be
no∣thing else, but what the <HI>Etchers</HI> in Copper use at this day to
cover their Plates with, to defend from the <HI>Aqua-fortis;</HI> which is a
Composition of Bitumen and Bees Wax.</P>
<P>Here also I saw a Manuscript of 3 or 4 Leaves written upon
true <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Paper, in which with an Eye-glass 'twas easie to
discern, how the flags were dis∣posed, length-ways and a-cross, one
o∣ver another. The Letters which re∣mained, which were but few, were large and
fair square Capitals. This Fragment I take to be the most ancient Writing
they have.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P. Mabil∣lon.</HI></NOTE>I Visited in this
Convent, at his Cham∣ber, <HI>Pere Mabillon,</HI> who has so well de∣served
of the Commonwealth of Learn∣ing by his Writings, and particularly that
Excellent Book <HI>De re Diplomaticâ;</HI> he seemed to me to be a very
good Na∣tured and Free-hearted Man; and was very well pleased to hear, that
our Ca∣talogue of <HI>English</HI> Manuscripts was so forward in the
Press at <HI>Oxford.</HI> He thankfully owned the favour of the
<HI>Cot∣ton</HI> Library; and was very sorry to hear of Dr.
<HI>Bernard</HI>'s Death, of whom he <PB N="120" REF="67"/>spoke very kindly;
but he expressed a wonderful Esteem for Dr. <HI>Gale,</HI> the Dean of
<HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>In another Conversation I had with <HI>P. Mabillon,</HI> (for he
was my Neighbour, and I was often with him) telling him the Account we had
brought us of <HI>Palmyra,</HI> and the Tracts that were writ of it, and that
more was intended to be pub∣lisht about it, he was much concerned, that
those Accounts, which were pure Matters of Learning in general, were written
in <HI>English;</HI> and he told me, he was afraid it might be with us, as it
was with them, since they cultivated their own Language so much, they began
to neglect the ancient Tongues, the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin.</HI></P>
<P>He shewed me certain Figures not ill taken with Red Chalk, of
some very an∣cient Monuments observed by some of the Fathers of their
Order; one of which was present in the Chamber, upon the Mountain of
<HI>Framond</HI> near <HI>Salme,</HI> which lies in the middle of that Tract of
the Mountain, called <HI>La Vauge,</HI> betwixt <HI>Al∣sace</HI> and
<HI>Lorraine.</HI> There were great Re∣mains of an ancient City. These
Fi∣gures which the Fathers shewed me, were about 12 in all; but 5 or 6 of
them were of <HI>Mercury;</HI> and Cock at his Foot; a <HI>Chla∣mys</HI> 
<PB N="121" REF="67"/>knotted upon the Right Shoulder, hanging at his Back; his
Hair laid in curles about his Face, and tied with a Ribban, whose two ends
might be seen on the top of his Head, like Horns; a <HI>Caduceus</HI> in his
Hand, which was very differently represented in all the Figures of him;
sometimes held up, othertimes the point resting at his Feet; sometimes
the Snakes were twisted about a Stick; and again in others without one, or
the Designer had taken no notice of it; some∣times the Tail of the Serpents
spread and flying about, and again in others close twisted with many
braids; a Girdle came round the bottom of his Belly, and which had in the
middle of it two Rings, one fastned to the other, and hanging be∣twixt his
Legs. These many <HI>Statues</HI> of <HI>Mercury</HI> in a <HI>French</HI>
Country are a con∣firmation of what <HI>Caesar</HI> says of the Reli∣gion
of the <HI>Gaules,</HI> in his 6th Book, <HI>Deum maxime Mercurium colunt:
hujus sunt pluri∣ma simulacra, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>There were some few <HI>Roman</HI> Letters on some of them,
which were so imperfect that I could make nothing of them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Library of <HI>St. Gene∣vieue.</HI></NOTE>The
<HI>Library of St. Genevieue</HI> is a very large and fair Gallery, upon the
very top of the House, well stored with Books on <PB N="122" REF="68"/>both
sides up to the top, and kept in Cases wired with Brass; which is a good
secu∣rity, and hinders not the Books from be∣ing seen.</P>
<P>Also it is adorned with fair <HI>Busto's</HI> of the ancient Men
of Learning.</P>
<P>The <HI>Musaeum</HI> is a little Closet on the side of this
Gallery; of which there is a Book lately publisht: I saw in it very little
of Natural History, that was re∣markable. They keep half a dozen Joints of a
large <HI>Cornu Ammonis,</HI> which they shew as a rarity. But it is well
stored with ancient <HI>Idols,</HI> and Sacrificing <HI>Vessels,
Lacrymatoirs, Pateras, Strigils;</HI> also an∣cient <HI>Weights and
Measures; Coins,</HI> and particularly the <HI>As,</HI> and its first and
latter Divisions.</P>
<P>There we saw an ancient <HI>As,</HI> with <HI>Etruscan
Letters</HI> of a kind of red Copper; The Letters seem to be a-kin to the old
<HI>Greek</HI> Characters. These are the Capital Letters about the Coin going
round, and bringing every Letter before you. <HI>See Table</HI> 1.
<HI>Figure</HI> 2.</P>
<P><HI>As quasi Aes;</HI> This is very reasonable, for before the
<HI>Greeks</HI> had invented double Letters, the <HI>Romans</HI> were skilled
in their Writing. So <HI>Vitruvius</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg"><HI>De
ar∣chitect.</HI> l. 7. c. 2. <HI>Ed. Barbari.</HI></NOTE> tells us
<HI>Aerugo</HI> was in the <HI>Hetruscan</HI> Tongue called <HI>Eruca;</HI>
Whence undoubtedly by Translation the <PB N="123" REF="68"/>common Caterpillar
had its Name, from its <HI>blueness;</HI> which also is an evidence, that
the <HI>Tuscan</HI> Writing was in the old <HI>Greek</HI> Character.</P>
<P>But nothing pleased me more than to have seen the Remains of the
Cabinet of the <HI>Noble Pieresc.</HI> the greatest and heartiest
<HI>Maecenas</HI> to his power of Learned Men of any of this Age.</P>
<P>Amongst the first and very old Brass <HI>Roman</HI> Coins
there was a <HI>Sextans</HI> with a Caduceus of <HI>Mercury</HI> on one side,
and a <HI>Scallop Shell on the other;</HI> probably, be∣cause they might have
at first had the use of <HI>Shell Money,</HI> as some parts of both the
<HI>Indies</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> have at this day, till <HI>Mercury,</HI>
whose Emblem that Staff is, taught them the use of <HI>Metallic
Money.</HI></P>
<P>Also in this Cabinet are Wet Mea∣sures, as the Ancient
<HI>Congius,</HI> of which they have an old one, and an exact Co∣py of that of
the <HI>Capitol;</HI> also a <HI>Sextarius,</HI> and a <HI>Quartarius.</HI>
Now the <HI>Congius</HI> con∣taining 120 Ounces The <HI>Sextarius</HI> 20
Ounces; The <HI>Hemina</HI> 10 Ounces; The <HI>Quartarius</HI> 5 Ounces, I
doubt not but the <HI>Cyathus,</HI> by reason of the aforesaid Divisi∣on,
held two Ounces and an half; which is the Measure so frequently to be met
with in old Physic Authors, and of so great concern in
<HI>Doses.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="69"/>In that <HI>Hetruscan As</HI>
before-mentioned, one Cap coifs or covers the double head of <HI>Janus.</HI> I
saw an ancient Statue of <HI>Mercury</HI> in the Garden belonging to the
Kings Library in <HI>Paris,</HI> where <HI>Mercury</HI> has upon his Head a
long Cap doubled, or laid double upon his Head, as though there were some
affinity betwixt those two Inventors of Trade, Arts and Learning.</P>
<P>Here also we saw the <HI>Steel Dyes of the Paduan Brothers,</HI>
by which they stampt and falsified the best ancient Medals so well,
that they are not to be distinguisht but by putting them into those
Molds; which makes them very valuable, there being a 100 and more of them, and
are prised at 10000 Crowns. They Stampt upon old Medals, whereby the Cheat
was the greater; for by this means they were of the ancient Mettal, had the
green Coat, and the same ragged Edges.</P>
<P>I saw a Picture here of about 6 inches over, finely painted in
<HI>Mosaic,</HI> the very little squares were scarce visible to the
naked Eye, but the whole appeared like the finest Hatchings in
<HI>Stampes;</HI> yet by the application of a good Eye-glass, I could readily
distinguish the squares of all colours, as in other <HI>Mosaiques.</HI>
This sort of Painting had a very admirable effect, besides the
duration.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="69"/>Here was also the <HI>Leg of a Mummi</HI>
well preserv'd, the Toes only bare, black and shining as Pitch: The Bandage
was very curious and was disposed in Oblique Circles, Decussated; but
the Fillating very narrow. I told the Father, that this was still Flesh;
and that Mummie therefore in <HI>Venice</HI>-Treacle did break Lent, if given
at that time; He answered, he did not believe it: I told him how he should
be convinced, <HI>viz.</HI> If that Leg was kept a good while in a damp Cellar,
it would yield and stink like very Carrion, tho' it was at least 3000 years
old; which thing happened to one in <HI>London,</HI> so carelesly laid
by.</P>
<P>There was one thing very curious, and that was an Ancient
<HI>Writing Instrument</HI> of thick and strong Silver-Wire, wound up like
a hollow Bottom or Screw; with both the Ends pointing one way, and at a
distance; so that a Man might easily put his Fore-Finger betwixt the two
Points, and the Screw fills the Ball of his Hand. One of the Points was the
Point of a Bodkin, which was to Write on Waxed Tables: The other Point was made
very Artificially, like the Head and Upper-Beak of a Cock, and the Point
divided in two, just like our <HI>Steel-Pens;</HI> from whence undoubtedly
the Moderns had <PB N="126" REF="70"/>their Patterns; which are now made al∣so
of fine Silver and Gold, or Princes Mettal; all which yet want a Spring, and
are therefore not so useful as of Steel, or a Quill: But a Quill soon
spoils; Steel is undoubtedly the best, and if you use <HI>China</HI> Ink,
the most lasting of all Inks, it never rusts the Pen, but rather
pre∣serves it with a kind of Varnish which dries upon it, though you take
no care in wiping it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">M. <HI>Colberts</HI> Library.</NOTE>I saw the
Library of the late Monsieur <HI>Colbert,</HI> that great Patron of Learning.
The Gallery wherein the Printed Books are kept, is a Ground-Room, with Win∣dows
on one side only, a-long a fine Gar∣den. It is the neatest Library in
<HI>Paris,</HI> very large, and exceedingly well furnisht. At the upper-end
is a fair Room, where∣in the Papers of State are kept; particu∣larly those of
the Administration of Car∣dinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> and his own Accounts when
he was in Employment: These make up many hundred Folio's, finely Bound in Red
Maroquin and Gilt.</P>
<P>The Manuscript Library is above∣stairs, in three Rooms, and is
the choicest of that kind in <HI>Paris:</HI> It contains 6610 Volumes. The
Catalogue of them Mon∣sieur <PB N="127" REF="70"/><HI>Balure</HI> shewed me;
which he said was designed shortly for the Press.</P>
<P>He shewed me many rare Books, <HI>Caro∣lus Calvus</HI>'s Bible, a
vast Folio in Vellum, and his Prayer Book or Hours, all writ in Gold
Letters.</P>
<P>Also the <HI>Missa Beati Rhenani,</HI> whereof all the Copies
were burnt but four. The Original Deed of the Agreement of the Greek and Roman
Church at <HI>Florence.</HI> The <HI>Regalia</HI> agreed upon at
<HI>Lyons,</HI> and many others which I have forgot.</P>
<P>I saw neither Greek nor Latin Manu∣script but what had the Marks
of the Goths upon them: that is, the Letters maimed, and consequently not
very An∣cient.</P>
<P>He shewed us <HI>Servieto</HI>'s Book, for which he was Burnt at
<HI>Geneva;</HI> which cost Mon∣sieur <HI>Colbert</HI> at an Auction in
<HI>England,</HI> 25 Crowns. The Title is, <HI>De Trinitatis Er∣roribus
Libri</HI> 7. <HI>per Michaelam Serveto alias Reves ab Aragonia Hispanum</HI>
1531. I had forgot the particular place where the Circulation of the Blood
through the Lungs is mentioned: but he told me very Civilly, I should have it
Transcribed at any time.</P>
<P>We told him, we came to see him as well as the Library: He
replied, It was his hap to have more Reputation than <PB N="128" REF="71"/>Merit. He was a little old Man, but very chearful and of a quick
Wit.</P>
<P>He complained much of the Refusal of the Emperor's People
concerning the Manuscripts of <HI>Vienna,</HI> in order to the publication of
the <HI>Capitulaires:</HI> For he said, Letters were never at War: That for
his part he had most willingly given leave for at least Twenty four
Manu∣scripts to be Collated for Dr. <HI>Mill</HI>'s Edi∣tion of the
Testament.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Library of the <HI>Sor∣bonne.</HI></NOTE>The
<HI>Library of the Sorbonne</HI> is a very long and large Gallery, reasonable
well stored with Books; no Catalogue Prin∣ted.</P>
<P>Amongst the Manuscripts, they shew, <HI>Titus Livy in
French,</HI> upon Vellum, in a very large Folio, Bound in two Books: The
first is almost throughout Illuminated with very fine Miniatures. The Book
is Dedicated to King <HI>John,</HI> by <HI>Pelon. Bercho∣rius:</HI> And in the
Title Page is a very cu∣rious Design of that King receiving the Present
from the Author of the Transla∣tion.</P>
<P>Amongst the Illuminations and Orna∣mental Pictures in the Margent,
I could not but take notice of a <HI>Brass Cannon</HI> fired, well Painted,
with two large Arms or Gudgeons, one on each side near the 
<PB N="129" REF="71"/>Touch-hole; which Evinces Cannon to have been in use at
that time.</P>
<P>This Manuscript confirms the loss of <HI>Titus Livy,</HI> and
that it was deficient in that Age, as to what is now wanting, there being
nothing more in this than what is in the Printed Copy. This was the Gift of
Cardinal <HI>Richlieu</HI> to the Li∣brary; who in a manner Rebuilt the whole
College, and Beautified it as it is. His Tomb is in the middle of the Quire,
before the great Altar, in White Marble; and is for plainness and exquisite
Perfor∣mance, the best thing of that kind I ever saw.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Library <HI>St. Victor.</HI></NOTE>I see the
<HI>Library of St. Victor:</HI> This most Antient Convent is the best
seated of any in <HI>Paris;</HI> has very large Gardens, with shady Walks,
well kept. The Li∣brary is a fair and large Gallery: It is open three days a
week, and has a range of double Desks quite through the mid∣dle of it, with
Seats and Conveniencies of Writing for 40 or 50 People.</P>
<P>The Catalogue was not finisht, nor in∣tended to be Printed; which
yet I think is always necessary in all Corporations, for check of loss of
Books, for the use of Strangers, for Benefactions.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="72"/>In a part of it, at the upper end, are kept the
Manuscripts; they are said to be 3000; which though not very Ancient, have
yet been found very useful for the most correct Editions of many Authors.
This is one of the pleasantest Rooms that can be seen, for the Beauty of
its Pro∣spect, and the Quiet and Freedom from Noise in the middle of so
great a City.</P>
<P>In this Convent is very prettily lodged, in an outward Court,
Monsieur <HI>Morin,</HI> another Physitian of that Name. In his Apartment,
he hath a large and excellent Collection of Physick Books and Natural
History. He Saluted me with the greatest Kindness imaginable; and at
first word, ask'd me, If there was any more of Sir <HI>Francis
Willoughby</HI>'s Works Printed be∣sides his History of Fishes, and that
other of Birds; both which he had. He had in another Room a well stored
Musaeum of Natural History, of all sorts, and of comparative Anatomies: A
Cabinet of Shells, another of Seeds, among which were some from
<HI>China:</HI> Variety of Ske∣letons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Celestins.</HI></NOTE>I saw the
<HI>Celestins.</HI> The Library is an Upper-Gallery, very pleasant, and
plen∣tifully furnisht with Books. This is a <PB N="131" REF="72"/>very fine
Convent; with the noblest <HI>Dor∣toire,</HI> having open Galleries round:
also, very large Gardens, with Alleys and shady Groves; and divers
Kitchin-Gardens, well Cultivated. Also a Vineyard of White-Wine Grapes, well
kept; which is the only thing of that Kind within the Walls of
<HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>Here I also saw the Closet or Cell of <HI>P. Hochereau;</HI>
who had a very choice Collection of Original Paintings, of very many of the
best Masters: Amongst the rest, I took notice of the Originals of
<HI>Rambrant,</HI> excellent Pieces, St. <HI>Peter and the Cock: The Nativity
of our Saviour:</HI> And, <HI>The Massacre of the Innocents.</HI> His
Co∣louring is not to be imitated: his Inven∣tion great and natural, and the
Design most correct.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="oxf" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> de l'Ora∣toirs. P. Malle∣branch.</HI></NOTE>I was to Visit
<HI>Pere Mallebranche</HI> of the Fathers of the Oratory: They live very neatly
together in a kind of Commu∣nity, but under no Rule: He was very handsomely
lodged, in a Room well furnisht: He is a very tall, lean man, of a ready Wit
and chearful Con∣versation.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="73"/>After an hours discourse, he carried me
into the <HI>Publick Library</HI> of the House: A fair Gallery well lighted,
and well fur∣nisht with Books; with an Apartment at the upper end for
Manuscripts, where were many Greek and Hebrew. Amongst the rest, the
Library-Keeper shewed us the <HI>Samaritan Pentateuch,</HI> of which
<HI>Morin</HI> made use. It seemed to me to be much later than that of Sir
<HI>John Cotton</HI>'s Libra∣ry with us, because it was of a much smaller
Letter, and more broken in the Writing, which was all I am capable to judge
by.</P>
<P>They were busie in Reforming the Disposition of the Library;
and making a good Catalogue, according to the Me∣thod of the late Archbishop
of <HI>Rheims;</HI> and which I like well of, they had drawn out some
Hundreds of Books, and exposed them in the middle of the Li∣brary, upon a
long Table, for Sale, as being Duplicates; and from the Sale of them to
furnish themselves with what they wanted.</P>
<P>The Books which were written by Protestants, I observed, they
were lockt up in Wired Cases, not to be come at without particular leave.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="73"/>The Freedom and Nature of this Order puts me in
mind of what I heard of a certain rich and learned Man, Monsieur
<HI>Pinet,</HI> of the Law; who put himself at length into Religion, as they
say, amongst the Fathers; but first persuaded his Cook to do so too;
for he was resolved not to quit his good Soupes, and such Dishes as he
liked, whatever became of his Penance and Retirement. This Compliment the
Elegant and Learned Monsieur <HI>Peletier,</HI> in Monsieur
<HI>Colbert</HI>'s place, Controller Gene∣ral of the <HI>Finances,</HI> made
his Guests at his Country House near <HI>Choisy,</HI> having voluntarily
quitted all his Imployments at Court: He said, He reserved his Cook, tho'
he retrencht the rest of his Retinue; they might therefore expect a slender
Phi∣losophers Dinner, tho' well drest.</P>
<P>It is wonderful to consider how most of the rest of the Orders
<HI>abuse</HI> themselves for God's Sake, as they call it. Hunger and
Ill-Diet not only destroys a Man's Health, but Maugre all his Devotion, puts
him out of Humour, and makes him Repine and Envy the rest of Man∣kind; and
well if it do not make him also Curse in his Heart his Maker; <HI>Job</HI>
is not every Man's Roll to Act. The Original and Rise of Natural Philosophy
<PB N="134" REF="74"/>and Physick was to Invent a more whol∣some and better
Food, than the Beasts have, and to Eat Bread and Flesh instead of Herbs
and Corn; to Drink Wine in∣stead of Water; those, and a thousand other
things were the Blessings of Physick, and still the good management of
these things, both in Health and Sickness, are under the Directions of the
Physitians. Now for a sort of <HI>Melancholly</HI> and <HI>Willful
Men,</HI> to renounce these Comforts, and destroy their Healths, and all
this upon a pretended Principle of Religion and De∣votion, seems to me, I
confess, great In∣gratitude to God the Author of it.</P>
<P>Indeed, I heartily pitied <HI>F. P.</HI> an in∣dustrious honest
Man, after his return from the <HI>Indies,</HI> who was nothing but Skin and
Bone; and yet by the Rules of his Order he could not Eat any thing that was
wholsome and proper for his Cure; nothing but a little slimy nasty Fish
and Herbs: And tho' he took, as he told me, <HI>Hypocochoana</HI> five times,
it had no effect upon him. 'Tis true, I never heard him complain; But what will
not blind prejudice do against all the Reason of Mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="74"/>I know some of these Men have been useful
to Mankind by their Studies; but the very same men would have been much more,
had they staid with their Neighbours, and Taught the World by their
Conversation and Example; Wis∣dom, and Justice, and Innocence, and
Temperance, which they highly pretend to, are not things to be hid in Corners,
but to be brought forth to Instruct and Adorn the Age we live in: To abandon
the World, and all the Conveniencies of Life and Health, is (let them say
what they please) the height of Chagrin, and not Religion.</P>
<P>There were some other Publick Libra∣ries I saw, as that of the
<HI>Grands Augu∣stins,</HI> Colledge <HI>Mazarin,</HI> Colledge
<HI>Navarre,</HI> and great many more I did not see for want of an
opportunity; but there is nothing particular I remember about them.</P>
<P>There is such a passion of setting up for Libraries, that
Books are come to most unreasonable Rates.</P>
<P>I paid to <HI>Anisson</HI> 36 Livres for <HI>Nizo∣lius;</HI> 20
Livres for the Two small Quar∣to's of the Memoirs of the <HI>Academie de
Sciences,</HI> that is, as I may say, for two years Philosophick
Transactions; for they began those Monthly Memoirs in <PB N="136" REF="75"/>imitation of ours, out of the Registers of the Academy, but did not
think fit to continue them above two years.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Stamps,</HI> I had a mind to have bought a compleat Set of
<HI>Melans,</HI> that in∣comparable Master; but I was askt 200 Livres, and 12
excepted, which might amount to as much more; for some of his Gravings in
<HI>Octavo</HI> done at <HI>Rome,</HI> they askt me a Pistol a-piece; and for
the Head of <HI>Justinianus</HI> a Louis; which yet is his
Master-piece.</P>
<P>I was at an Auction of Books in the <HI>Ruë St. Jaques,</HI>
where were about 40 or 50 People, most Abbots and Monks. The Books were
sold with a great deal of trifling and delay as with us, and very dear; for
<HI>Hispania illustrata Aud. Sciotti,</HI> of the <HI>Francfort</HI>
Edition, from 20 Livres, at which it was set, they bid up by little and
little to 36 Livres; at which it was sold. The next was a <HI>Catalogue of
French Books</HI> in a thin Fol. in an old Parchment Cover by <HI>De la Croix
de Maine,</HI> 8 Livres. And so I left them to shift it amongst
themselves.</P>
<P>After having said so much of the <HI>Pub∣lick Libraries,</HI> I
cannot but congratulate their happiness, to have them so well se∣cured
from Fire; it being one of the Perfections of this City to be so built and 
<PB N="137" REF="75"/>furnisht, as not to have suffered by it these many
Ages; and, indeed, I cannot see how Malice it self could destroy them,
for the Houses here are all built of Stone, Walls, Floors, Staircases and
all, some few Rooms excepted; no Wainscot; Woollen or Silk Hangings, which
can∣not be fired without giving notice by the intolerable stench, and the
supply of much Fuel. 'Tis well for us in <HI>London,</HI> that there are very
few publick Libraries, and those small and inconsiderable, and that the
great number of Books are di∣stributed into a thousand hands, (no Country
in <HI>Europe</HI> can compare to us for private Libraries) for if they were
toge∣ther in such vast quantities as in <HI>Paris,</HI> Learning would run
the hazard of daily suffering. Here with us, me-thinks, every Man that goes
to Bed, when a∣sleep, lies like a dead <HI>Roman</HI> upon a Fu∣neral Pile,
dreading some unexpected <HI>Apo∣theosis;</HI> for all is combustible
about him, and the Paint of the Deal Boards may serve for Incense, the
quicker to burn him to Ashes.</P>
<P>In the next place I will Account for what I saw, that seemed to
me singular and new in the Improvement of Arts, or wanting in our
Country.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="76"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Potterie</HI> of <HI>St. Clou.</HI></NOTE>I
saw the <HI>Potterie of St. Clou,</HI> with which I was marvellously well
pleased, for I confess I could not distinguish be∣twixt the Pots made
there, and the finest <HI>China Ware</HI> I ever saw. It will, I know, be
easily granted me, that the <HI>Paintings</HI> may be better designed and
finisht, (as indeed it was) because our Men are far better Masters in
that Art, than the <HI>Chi∣neses;</HI> but the <HI>Glazing</HI> came not in
the least behind theirs, not for whiteness, nor the smoothness of
running without Bubles; again, the <HI>inward Substance</HI> and Matter of
the Pots was, to me, the very same, hard and firm as Marble, and the self
same grain, <HI>on this side vitrification.</HI> Farther, the
<HI>Transparency</HI> of the Pots the very same.</P>
<P>I see them also in the Mold, undried, and before the Painting
and Glazing was applied, they were as white as Chalk, and melted upon the
Tongue like raw To∣bacco Pipe Clay, and felt betwixt the Teeth soft like
that, and very little grit∣ty; so that I doubt not, but they are made of that
very Clay.</P>
<P>As to the Temper of the Clay, the Man freely owned to me, it was 3
or 4 times well beaten and wet, before it was put to work on the Wheel; but I
believe <PB N="139" REF="76"/>it must first be melted in fair Water, and
carefully drawn off, that the heaviest part may first sink; which also
may be proper for Courser Works.</P>
<P>That it required two, and sometimes 3 or 4 Fires to bake it, to
that height we saw it in the most finisht Pots: Nay, some of them had

<P>I did not expect to have found it in this perfection, but imagined
this might have arrived at the <HI>Gomron Ware;</HI> which is, indeed, little
else, but a total Vitrifi∣cation; but I found it far otherwise, and very
surprising, and which I account part of the felicity of the Age to equal,
if not surpass the <HI>Chineses</HI> in their finest Art.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Red Ware</HI> for <HI>China,</HI> that has been, and
is done in <HI>England,</HI> to a far greater perfection than in
<HI>China,</HI> we ha∣ving as good Materials, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Soft
Hae∣matites,</HI> and far better Artists in Pottery. But in this particular
we are beholding to two <HI>Dutchmen</HI> Brothers, who wrought in
<HI>Staffordshire,</HI> (as I have been told) and were not long since at
<HI>Hammersmith.</HI></P>
<P>They sold these Pots at <HI>St. Clou</HI> at ex∣cessive
Rates; and for their ordinary Cho∣colate Cups askt Crowns a-piece. They had
arrived at the Burning on Gold in neat Chequer Works. He had some Fur∣nitures
of Tea Tables at 400 Livres a Sett.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="77"/>There was no Molding or Model of <HI>China</HI>
Ware, which they had not imitat∣ed; and had added many Fancies of their own,
which had their good effects, and appeared very beautiful.</P>
<P>Mons. <HI>Morin</HI> in Conversation told me, that they kept
their Sand as a Secret to themselves; but this could not be for o∣ther
purposes than Colouring: Also he said they used Salt of <HI>Kelp</HI>
in the Com∣position, and made a thing not unlike <HI>Frit</HI> for Glass to
be wrought up with White Clay; neither could this be, for I did not taste it
in the Raw Pots.</P>
<P>The Ingenuous Master told me, he had been 25 years about the
Experiment, but had not attained it fully, till within this 3 years.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Glasserie.</HI></NOTE>The
<HI>Glass-house</HI> out of the Gate of <HI>St. Antoine</HI> well
deserves seeing; but I did lament the Fondery was no longer there, but
removed to <HI>Cherborne</HI> in <HI>Nor∣mandy</HI> for cheapness of Fuel.
'Tis cer∣tainly a most considerable addition to the Glass-making. For I
saw here one Looking-glass foiled and finisht, 88 inches long, and 48
inches broad; and yet but one quarter of an inch thick. This, I think, could
never be effected by the Blast of any Man; but I suppose to be 
<PB N="141" REF="77"/>run or cast upon Sand, as Lead is; which yet, I
confess, the toughness of Glass Mettal makes very much against.</P>
<P>There they are polished; which Im∣ploys daily 600 Men, and they
hope in a little time to employ a 1000 in several Galleries. In the lower
they grind the course Glass with a Sand Stone, the very same they Pave
the Streets in <HI>Paris;</HI> of which broken they have great heaps in the
Courts of the Work-houses: This Stone is beat to Powder, and sifted through
a fine Tamis. In the Upper Gallery, where they polish and give the last
Hand, they work in 3 Rowes, and 2 Men at a Plate, with Ruddle or Powdered
Haematites in Water.</P>
<P>The Glasses are set fast in White Puttie, upon flat Tables
of Stone, sawed thin for that purpose. The grinding the Edges and Borders
is very troublesome, and odious for the horrid grating noise it makes, and
which cannot be endured to one that is not used to it; and yet by long
custom these Fellows are so easie with it, that they Discourse
together as nothing were. This is done below, and out of the way of the
rest.</P>
<P>'Tis very diverting to see the joint La∣bour of so many Men upon
one Subject. This has made Glass for Coaches very <PB N="142" REF="78"/>cheap
and common; so that even many of the <HI>Fiacres</HI> or Hackneys, and all
the <HI>Remises</HI> have one large Glass before.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Artificial Pearl.</NOTE>Amongst the
<HI>Bïoux</HI> made at <HI>Paris,</HI> a great quantity of <HI>Artificial
Pearl</HI> is to be had, of divers sorts; but the best are those which
are made with Scales of <HI>Bleakes.</HI> These Bleaks they fish in the
River <HI>Seine</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> and sell them to the Pearl-makers for
that purpose.</P>
<P>Mons. <HI>Favi,</HI> at the <HI>Pearle d'Angleterre,</HI> told me,
that he paid for the Fish only of the little River <HI>Yier of Ville Neuve
St. George,</HI> 4 Leagues off of <HI>Paris,</HI> by the year 110 Pistols.
This Fish in <HI>French</HI> is called <HI>De la Bellette:</HI> Sometimes in
Win∣ter he has had 30 Hampers of the Fish brought him, for the Scales only
which he uses in Pearl-making. He sells some Strings for a Pistol; and
they have for∣merly been sold much dearer. This sort is very neat and
lasting.</P>
<P>Enquiring of a Goldsmith, a great Dealer in Pearl, about those
which were made of the Scales of Fishes, he told me, that it was so; That
the Scales were beat to Powder, and that made into a Liquid Past with
Icing-glass, and cast into the hollow Glass Beads, and so gave the
co∣lour by way of foil from the inside.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="78"/>I askt him, if he had any Fresh Wa∣ter and
<HI>Muscle Pearl;</HI> and he forthwith shewed me one of 23 Grains, of a
blush colour or faint Cornation, perfectly glo∣bular; he told me, he valued
it at 400 <HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR></HI> for that it would mix or match better with
the Oriental <HI>Sea Pearl,</HI> than the bluish ones. Further, he
assured me he had seen Pearl of 60 odd Grains of Fresh Water Muscles;
and some Pear fashion∣ed. That in <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and at <HI>Sedan,</HI>
they fisht many Pearls in the Rivers there∣about.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Gobe∣lins.</HI></NOTE>The formerly so

<P>Also the <HI>Atteliers</HI> or Work-houses of Two of the famous

admirably; also that other of <HI>Quoisivox,</HI> in which was, amongst

intolerable.</P>
<P>He himself also formerly wrought in false Pearl, and affirmed,
that the Glass Pearls were painted within with a Paste made of the Scales
of the <HI>Bleak</HI> only; which he said was a good Trade here to the
Fishermen, who sold the Scales for so much the Ounce. These Necklaces
were formerly sold at great Prices, 2 or 3 Pi∣stoles a-piece.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>La Platre∣rie.</HI></NOTE>I saw the
<HI>Platrerie or Plaster Quarries near Montmartre,</HI> and the manner of
burn∣ing of it. 'Tis burnt with open Fire, set up against it; The hardest
Stone is burnt enough in 2 or 3 hours time.</P>
<P>The top <HI>Band or Bed</HI> is very hard like a Free-stone, they
distinguish the Beds by several Names, <HI>i. e.</HI> 1. <HI>Mutton,</HI>
2. <HI>Lane,</HI> 3. <HI>Busier,</HI> 4. <HI>Clikar,</HI> 5.
<HI>Grosban,</HI> 6. <HI>Pillier noir, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>That which they call <HI>Lane</HI> is like <HI>Talke</HI> or
<HI>Selenites</HI> transparent, and splits in thin flakes; but there is but
little of it, and the Beds are small; This seems to be but a <HI>Fluor</HI>
to the greater Beds of grey Stone. <PB N="145" REF="79"/>This Rock is covered
with a kind of gray Sand to a great depth; which is not of the nature of
Plaster.</P>
<P>Though this Plaster burnt is never used (that I could learn) to
fertilize either Corn Ground, or Pasture, as our Limestone is; yet I see
no reason, why it may not, it being full of Nitre, if it has lain long in
damp Caves.</P>
<P>This is not peculiar to <HI>Paris</HI> only; for I have seen

<P>These Mill-stones are very useful, and so sweet, that not
the least grit is ever found in their Bread: They are mostly made up of
pieces, 2, 3, or more set to∣gether by a cement, and hooped round with Iron
to keep the pieces faster toge∣ther: They are made of a kind of

Well in <HI>Yorkeshire:</HI> therefore I ad∣vise my Countreymen to put
these ex∣cellent Stones in practice; for certainly no place stands in more
need of it; for the Bread in the North of <HI>England</HI> is into∣lerably
gritty, by reason of those <HI>Sand or Moore Stones,</HI> with which they
grind their Corn.</P>
<P>These Stones are sold at 500 Livres a pair; whence they come I

<DIV1 TYPE="section">
<P>In the next place we will see how the <HI>Parisians</HI> Eat,
Drink, and Divert them∣selves.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Of the Food of the <HI>Parisians.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bread.</NOTE>The Diet of the
<HI>Parisians</HI> consists chief∣ly of <HI>Bread</HI> and
<HI>Herbs;</HI> it is here, as with us, finer and courser. But the com∣mon
Bread, or <HI>Pain de Gonesse,</HI> which is brought twice a week into
<HI>Paris</HI> from a Village so called, is purely white, and firm and light,
and made altogether with Leaven; mostly in 3 Pound Loaves, and
3<HI><ABBR>d.</ABBR></HI> a Pound. That which is Bak'd in <HI>Paris</HI> is
courser and much worse.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>fine Manchet,</HI> or <HI>French</HI> Bread, as we
call it, I cannot much com∣mend it; it is of late, since the quantity 
<PB N="147" REF="80"/>of Beer that is Brewed in <HI>Paris,</HI> often so
bitter, that it is not to be eaten, and we far exceed them now in this
particular in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Gray Salt</HI> of <HI>France</HI> (which there, at Table,
is altogether in every thing made use of) is incomparably better and more
wholsome than our White Salt. This I the rather mention, because it seems
not yet to enter fully into the con∣sideration and knowledge of our People;
who are nice in this particular to a fault. But I must take leave to tell
them, that our Salt spoils every thing, that is pre∣tended to be preserved
by it, be it Fish or Flesh. For whether boiled from the in∣land Salt Pits,
or the Sea Water, it is little less than Quicklime, and burns and reeses
all it touches; so that 'tis pity to see so much good Fish, as is
caught upon the Northern Line of Coast, particularly the God and Ling and
Herring, now of little value, which were formerly the most esteemed
Commodities of <HI>England.</HI> 'Tis certain there is no making good Salt by
fierce and vehement boiling, as is used; but it must be kerned either by
the heat of the Sun, as in <HI>France;</HI> or by a full and over-weighty
Brine, as at <HI>Milthrope</HI> in the <HI>Washes</HI> of
<HI>Lancashire;</HI> for in no o∣ther place in <HI>England</HI> I ever saw
it right <PB N="148" REF="81"/>made; but yet that is not there under∣stood to
purpose, for they also boil the Brine, which possibly by some
slight Ar∣tifice might be brought to give its Salt without stress of
Fire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">White Kid∣ney Beans and Len∣tils.</NOTE>In
<HI>Lent</HI> the common People feed much on White <HI>Kidney Beans,</HI> and
white or pale <HI>Lentils,</HI> of which there are great Provisi∣ons made in
all the Markets, and to be had ready boiled. I was well pleased with this
Lentil; which is a sort of Pulse we have none of in <HI>England.</HI> There
are two sorts of <HI>White Lentils</HI> sold here; one small one, from
<HI>Burgundy,</HI> by the Cut of <HI>Briare;</HI> and another bigger, as broad
a∣gain from <HI>Chartres;</HI> A 3d also much larger, is sometimes to be
had from <HI>Lan∣guedoc.</HI> Those excepted, our Seed Shops far exceed
theirs, and consequently our Gardens, in the Pulse Kind for variety; both
Pea and Bean.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Long Tur∣neps.</NOTE>The <HI>Roots</HI> differ
much from ours. There are here no round Turneps; but all <HI>long ones</HI> and
small; but excellently well tast∣ed, and are of a much greater use, being
proper for Soupes also; for which pur∣pose ours are too strong; we have,
in∣deed, of late got them into <HI>England,</HI> but our Gardners understand
not the Manag∣ing <PB N="149" REF="81"/>of them. They sow them here late after
<HI>Midsummer;</HI> and at <HI>Martinmas</HI> or sooner, before the Frost
begin, they dig them up, cut off the tops, and put them into Sand in their
Cellars, where they will keep good till after <HI>Easter,</HI> nay, till
<HI>Whitsuntide;</HI> Whereas if the Frost take them, they are quite
spoilt, and that piece of ill Husbandry makes them to be despised here;
having lost their taste, and they soon grow sticky in the Ground. The
Sandy Plains of <HI>Vaugerard</HI> near <HI>Pa∣ris,</HI> are famous for this
sort of most Ex∣cellent Root. After the same manner they keep their
Carrets.</P>
<P>After we had been 2 or 3 days Jour∣ney in <HI>France,</HI> we
found no other Tur∣neps but the <HI>Navet;</HI> and still the nearer
<HI>Paris</HI> the better. These, as I said, are small long Turneps, not
bigger than a Knife Haft, and most excellent in Soupes, and with Boiled and
Stewed Mutton. I think it very strange, that the Seed should so much
improve in <HI>England,</HI> as to pro∣duce Roots of the same Kind 6 or 10
times as big as there; for I make no que∣stion, but the long Turneps, of late
only in our Markets, are the same.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Potato.</NOTE>The <HI>Potato</HI> are scarce
to be found in their Markets, which are so great a Re∣lief 
<PB N="150" REF="82"/>to the People of <HI>England,</HI> and very nourishing
and wholesome Roots; 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jerusalem Artichokes.</NOTE>but there are
store of <HI>Jerusalem Hartichokes.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cabage.</NOTE>They delight not so much in
Cabage, as I expected, at least at the Season while we were there, from
<HI>December</HI> to <HI>Mid∣summer.</HI> I never saw in all the Markets
once <HI>Sprouts,</HI> that is, the tender Roots of Cabages; nor in their
publick Gardens, any Reserves of old Stalks. The Red Ca∣bage is esteemed
here, and the Savoy.</P>
<P>But to make amends for this, they a∣bound in vast quantities of
large <HI>Red O∣nions</HI> and Garlick. And the long and sweet White Onion of
<HI>Languedoc</HI> are to be had also here. Also Leeks, Rockam∣boy, and
Shallots are here in great use.</P>
<P>It has been observed, that the Nor∣thern People of
<HI>Europe</HI> much delight in Cabage, as the <HI>Russes, Poles, Germans,
&amp;c.</HI> 'Tis certain the Cabage thrives best in cold Countreys, and is
naturally a Nor∣thern Plant, and the Keel is to be found wild upon the Maritine
Rocks, as I have seen it at <HI>Whitby,</HI> and the Cold ripens it, and
makes it more tender and palata∣ble.</P>
<P>The Southern People are pleased with the Onion Kind, for the
same reason, for that the great Heats meliorate them, but 
<PB N="151" REF="82"/>give a rankness to the Cabage. The <HI>Leeks</HI> are
here much smaller than with us; but to recompence this, they are blancht here
with more care and art, and are 3 times as long in the white part, which is by
sinking them early so deep in mellow Earth. There is no Plant of the Onion
Kind so hardy as this, and so proper for the cold Mountains; witness the
use the <HI>Welsh</HI> have made of them from all Ages; and indeed it is
excellent against Spitting of Blood, and all Diseases of the Throat and
Lungs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lettice.</NOTE>Though the Lettice be the great
and universal Sallet, yet I did not find they came near our People, for the
largeness and hardness of them; indeed, about a week before we left
<HI>Paris,</HI> the long Ro∣man Lettice filled their Markets, which was
incomparable, and I think beyond our <HI>Silesian.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">White Beets.</NOTE><HI>April</HI> and
<HI>May</HI> the Markets were served with vast quantities of <HI>White
Beets,</HI> an Herb rarely used with us, and never that I know of, in that
manner for Soupes. The Leaves grow long and large, and are tied up, as we do
our Silesian or Roman Lettice to blanch, and then cut by the Root: The Stalks
are very broad and <PB N="152" REF="83"/>tender, and they only are used,
stript of the green Leaves; They Cook those Stalks in different
manners.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Asparagus.</NOTE>The Asparagus here are in
great plenty, but for the first month they were very bitter and unpleasant;
from whence that proceeded I cannot guess; afterwards I did not much perceive
it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sorrel.</NOTE>They are so great Lovers of
<HI>Sorrel,</HI> that I have seen whole Acres of it plant∣ed in the Fields;
and they are to be com∣mended for it; for nothing is more whole∣some, and it
is good to supply the place of Lemons, against the Scurvy, or any ill habit
of the Body.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mushrooms.</NOTE>But after all, the French
delight in no∣thing so much as <HI>Mushroomes;</HI> of which they have
daily, of which they have daily, and all the Winter long, store of fresh
and new gathered in the Markets. This surprised me; nor could I guess
where they had them, till I found they raised them on hot Beds in their
Gardens.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Forc't Mushroomes</HI> they have many Crops in a year;
but for the Months of <HI>August, September, October,</HI> when they
na∣turally grow in the Fields, they prepare no Artificial Beds.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="83"/>They make in the Fields and Gardens out of
the Bar of <HI>Vaugerard</HI> (which I saw) long narrow Trenches, and fill
those Trenches with Horse Dung 2 or 3 foot thick, on which they throw up
the common Earth of the place, and cover the Dung with it, like the ridge of a
House, high pitched; and over all they put long Straw or long Horse Litter;

<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Champig∣nons.</HI></NOTE>Out of this Earth
springs the <HI>Champignons,</HI> after Rain, and if Rain comes not, they
Water the Beds every day, even in Winter.</P>
<P>They are 6 days after their springing, or first appearance,
before they pull them up for the Market.</P>
<P>On some Beds they have plenty, on others but few, which
demonstrate they come of Seed in the Ground; for all the Beds are alike.</P>
<P>A Gardner told me, he had the other year near an Acre of Ground
ordered in this manner, but he lost a 100 Crowns by it; but mostly they
turn to as good profit, as any thing they can plant.</P>
<P>They destroy their old Beds in Sum∣mer, and dung their Grounds
with them.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="84"/>They prepare their new Beds the lat∣ter end
of <HI>August,</HI> and have plentiful Crops of Mushrooms towards
<HI>Christmas,</HI> and all the Spring, till after <HI>March.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Moriglio's.</HI></NOTE>I saw in the
Markets the beginning of <HI>April,</HI> fresh gathered <HI>Moriglio's,</HI>
the first of that Kind of Mushroom, that I re∣member ever to have seen;
though for∣merly I had been very curious and in∣quisitive about this Kind of
Plant, and had distinguisht and described 30 Species of them growing in
<HI>England,</HI> yet I do not remember ever to have found this Species with
us; it is blackish, and be∣comes much blacker, when boiled, whence probably
it had its Name; but there are some few of them that are yellow. They are
always of a round Pyramidal Figure, upon a short thick Foot-stalk; The
Foot∣stalk is smooth, but the outside of the Mushroom is all deeply
pleated and wrinkled like the inside of a Beasts Maw. The Moriglio split
in two from top to bottom is all hollow and smooth, Foot, stalk, and all.
In this hollowness is some∣times contained dangerous Insects. The taste
raw is not ungrateful, and very tender. This Mushroom seems to me to be
produced of the Tree Kind.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="84"/>This sort of Mushroom is much e∣steemed
in <HI>France,</HI> and is mostly gather∣ed in Woods at the foot of the
<HI>Oaks;</HI> There were some of them as big as Turky Eggs. They are found
in great quantities in the Woods in <HI>Champagne,</HI> about <HI>Reims,</HI>
and <HI>Nostre Dame de Liesse.</HI></P>
<P>They string them, and dry them; and they seem to me to have a
far better relish than the <HI>Champignons.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> say there are no bad Mo∣riglio's; but there
are bad Mushrooms. At first I was very shie of eating them; but by
degrees, and that there was scarce any Ragouts without them, I became
pleased with them, and found them very innocent. I am persuaded the harm
that comes from eating them, is from the noxious Insects and Vermin that feed
upon them, and creep into them; I have often found them full of such Animals.
Possibly the Garden or forc't Mushrooms, being that is done in Winter,
and in the Spring, may be much freer of this mischief, at what time Insects
are dead, or not much stirring, than the wild Mushrooms of
<HI>August.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fish.</NOTE>This City is well served with
<HI>Carp,</HI> of which there is an incredible quantity spent in the
<HI>Lent;</HI> They are not large, and <PB N="156" REF="85"/>I think are the
better for it, but they are very clean of Mud, and well tasted.</P>
<P>They have a particular way of bring∣ing fresh Oysters to Town,
which I never saw with us; To put them up in <HI>Straw Baskets</HI> of a
Pecke suppose, cut from the Shell, and without the Liquor; They are thus
very good for Stewing, and all other manner of Dressing.</P>
<P>There is such plenty of <HI>Macreuse,</HI> a sort of Sea
Ducks, in the Markets all <HI>Lent,</HI> that I admire where they got so
many; but these are reckoned and e∣steemed as Fish, and therefore they
take them with great Industry; They have a rank fishy taste, yet for want
of other Flesh were very welcome. I remember we had at our Treat at the
King's Charge at <HI>Versailles</HI> a <HI>Macreuse Pye</HI> near two foot
diameter, for it was in <HI>Lent;</HI> which be∣ing high Seasoned, did go
down very well with rare Burgundy. There is a better Argument in
<HI>Leewenhoeke</HI> for Birds participating something of the nature of
Fish, though their Blood is hot, than any the <HI>Council of Trent</HI> could
think of, and that is, that the <HI>Globuli</HI> of the Blood of Birds are
Oval, as those of Fishes are; but this will take in all the Bird Kind;
which also in time those Gentlemen may think fit to grant.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="85"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flesh.</NOTE>As for their Flesh, Mutton and
Beef, if they are good in their Kind, they come little short of ours, I
cannot say they exceed them. But their Veal is not to be compared with ours,
being red and course; and I believe no Countrey in <HI>Europe</HI>
understands the Management of that sort of Food like the
<HI>English.</HI> This was once proper to <HI>Essex;</HI> but now it is
well known, that nothing contributes more to the whiteness and tenderness
of the Flesh of Calves, than <HI>often Bleeding</HI> them, and giving them
much Food of Milk and Meal, besides sucking the Dam. By much Bleeding the
red Cake of the Blood is exhausted, and becomes all <HI>White Serum</HI> or
Chyle. The same effect Cramming hath upon Poultry, so as the Blood is well
near all Chyle; and the Livers of Geese so fed by force, will be∣come, for
the same reason, vastly great, and white and delicious.</P>
<P>I cannot but take notice here of a great Prejudice the
<HI>French</HI> lie under, in relation to our Flesh; 'Tis generally said
amongst them, that our Meat in <HI>England</HI> will not make so strong
Broth, as the <HI>French,</HI> by a third part. If they say, not so salt
and savoury, and strong tasted, I agree with them; and yet the
<HI>French</HI> Meat <PB N="158" REF="86"/>is never the better. For first
their Meat is mostly leaner and more dry, and (which is all in all in this
matter of Soupes) is long kept before it be spent, which gives it a higher
and salter taste; for as Meat rots, it becomes more urinous and salt. Now
our People by custom, covet the freshest Meat, and cannot indure the
least tendency to putrefaction; and we have good reason to do so,
because our Air is twice as moist as theirs, which does often cause in
the keeping of Meat a Mustiness, which is intolerable to all Mankind;
whereas the Air of <HI>France</HI> be∣ing so much drier, keeping of Meat, not
only makes it tender, but improves the taste. So that could we secure our
Meat, in keeping it from that unsavoury qua∣lity, it would far outdo the
<HI>French</HI> Meat, because much more juicy.</P>
<P>I don't remember I eat of above two sorts of Flesh, but what
we have as good or better in <HI>England,</HI> and that was of the Wild Pigs;
and the Redleg'd Partridge. Of these last I eat at <HI>St. Clou,</HI> taken
there∣abouts; as to bigness; they are much de∣generated from those in
<HI>Languedoc,</HI> and less; but far excel the gray Partridge in
taste.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="86"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruits.</NOTE>As for their Fruits our Journey
was in the worst time of the year, from <HI>De∣cember</HI> to
<HI>Midsummer,</HI> so that we had little save Winter Fruits; some few
<HI>Bon Chri∣tiens</HI> we tasted, not much better than ours, but something
freer of Stones; the <HI>Virguleus</HI> Pears were admirable, but to our
sorrow, they did not last long af∣ter our arrival.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kentish Pippin,</HI> as we call it, was here excellent;
but two other sorts of Apples stock the Markets. The Winter <HI>Calvil</HI>
or <HI>Queening,</HI> which though a ten∣der and soft Apple, yet continued
good till after <HI>Easter.</HI> Also the <HI>Pome d'Apis,</HI> which is
served here for shew, more than use; being a small flat Apple, very
beau∣tiful, very red on one side, and pale or white on the other, and may
serve the Ladies at their Toilets for a Pattern to Paint by. However this
tender Apple was not contemptible after <HI>Whitsuntide;</HI> and which is
its property, it never smells ill, though the Ladies keep it (as some∣times
they do) about them.</P>
<P>I never met with any thing peculiar in their Sweet Meats, but a
Marmalade of <HI>Orange Flowers;</HI> which indeed was admi∣rable; 'Twas made
with those Flowers, the Juice of Lemons, and fine Sugar.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>Wines</HI> follow, and <HI>Water</HI> to Drink.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wines.</NOTE>The Wines about <HI>Paris</HI> are
very small, yet good in their Kind; those <HI>de Surene</HI> are excellent
some years; but in all the Taverns they have a way to make them into the
fashion of <HI>Champagne</HI> and <HI>Bur∣gundy.</HI></P>
<P>The Tax upon Wines is now so great, that whereas before the War
they drank them by Retail at 5<HI><ABBR>d.</ABBR></HI> the Quart, they now
sell them at 15<HI><ABBR>d.</ABBR></HI> the Quart and dearer, which has
inhansed the Rates of all Commodities, and Workmens Wages; and also has
caused many thousand pri∣vate Families to lay in Wines in their Cellars at
the cheapest hand, which used to have none before.</P>
<P>The Wines of <HI>Burgundy</HI> and <HI>Champagne</HI> are most
valued; and indeed, not with∣out reason; for they are light and easie upon
the Stomach, and give little distur∣bance to the Brain, if drawn from the
Hogshead, or loose botled after their fashion.</P>
<P>The most esteemed are <HI>Vin de Bonne</HI> of
<HI>Burgundy,</HI> a <HI>red Wine;</HI> which is <HI>Dolce Pi∣quante</HI> in
some measure, to me it seemed the very best of Wine I met with.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="87"/><HI>Volne,</HI> a pale Champagne, but
exceed∣ing brisk upon the Palate. This is said to grow upon the very borders
of <HI>Bur∣gundy,</HI> and to participate of the Excel∣lency of both
Counties.</P>
<P>There is another sort of Wine, called <HI>Vin de Rheims,</HI>
this is also a pale or gray Wine; it is harsh; as all <HI>Champagne</HI>
Wines are.</P>
<P>The White Wines of value are those of <HI>Mascon</HI> in
<HI>Burgundy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mulso</HI> in <HI>Champagne,</HI> a small and not
unpleasant White Wine.</P>
<P><HI>Chabri</HI> is a quick and sharp White Wine well
esteemed.</P>
<P>In <HI>March</HI> I tasted the White Wines called
<HI>Condrieu,</HI> and <HI>d'Arbois,</HI> but found them both in the Must,
thick and white as our Wines use to be, when they first come from the
<HI>Canaries;</HI> very sweet, and yet not without a grateful flavour; they
clear towards Summer, and abate much of the flavour and sweet taste.
Those Wines thus in the Must are called in the Prints <HI>Vin des
Liqueurs.</HI></P>
<P>There is a preparation or rather stif∣ling of the White Wine in
the Must, used in <HI>Burgundy</HI> and elsewhere, which they call
<HI>Vin Bouru;</HI> it gives a sweet taste, and it is foul to the Eye;
those also are called <HI>Vin des Liqueurs.</HI> This is only drunk a
Glass <PB N="162" REF="88"/>in a morning, as an equivalent to Brandy.</P>
<P><HI>Vin de Turene en Anjou</HI> of two years old, was one of the
best White Wines I drunk in <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gannetin</HI> from <HI>Dauphine:</HI> This is a very pale and
thin White Wine, very like the <HI>Verde</HI> of <HI>Florence,</HI> sweet,
and of a very pleasant flavour, especially while it is <HI>Des
Liqueurs.</HI></P>
<P>The Red Wines of <HI>Burgundy, Des qua∣tres feuilles,</HI> as they
say, or of 4 years old, are rare, but they are esteemed much more
wholesom, and are permitted to the Sick, in some cases, to drink of; they
are fine, and have a rough, but sound taste; not prickt, as I expected.
This Term <HI>Des quatre feuilles,</HI> is used also to <HI>Volne,</HI> or
any other sort of Wine which is kept any time.</P>
<P>There are also in esteem stronger Wines at <HI>Paris,</HI>
as <HI>Camp de Perdris.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Coste Bruslee,</HI> both Red Wines from <HI>Dauphine,</HI>
of very good taste, and hot upon the Stomach.</P>
<P><HI>De l'Hermitage</HI> upon the <HI>Rosne.</HI></P>
<P>But the most excellent Wines for strength and flavour are the
<HI>Red and White St. Laurence,</HI> a Town betwixt <HI>Tou∣lon</HI> and
<HI>Nice</HI> in <HI>Provence.</HI> This is a most delicious
<HI>Muscat.</HI> These are of those sorts <PB N="163" REF="88"/>of
Wines, which the <HI>Romans</HI> called <HI>Vinum passum,</HI> that were
made of half Sun dried Grapes: for the Grapes (especially the White
Muscadine Grapes) being usually sooner ripe, than the common Grapes of
the Country, called <HI>Esperan, viz.</HI> the lat∣ter end of
<HI>August,</HI> (as I have seen them in the Vintage at <HI>Vic,
Mirabel,</HI> and <HI>Fron∣tiniac,</HI> 3 Towns near the Sea in
<HI>Langue∣doc,</HI> where this sort of Wine is made) they twist the
Bunches of Grapes, so breaking the Stalks of them, that they receive no
longer any nourishment from the Vine, but hang down and dry in the then
violently hot Sun, and are in few days almost turned into Raisins of the
Sun; hence, from this insolation, the flavour of the Grape is exceedingly
height∣ned, and the strength and oiliness, and thick Body of the Wine is
mightily im∣proved. I think the <HI>Red St. Lauren</HI> was the most
delicious Wine I ever tasted in my life.</P>
<P>Besides these, here are also the White Wines of <HI>Orleans,
Bourdeaux</HI> Claret, and those Excellent Wines from <HI>Cahors:</HI> also
<HI>Cabreton,</HI> White and Red, from about <HI>Bayone,</HI> strong and
delicious Wines: and all sorts of <HI>Spanish</HI> Wines, as Sack, Palme,
Mountaine Malaga, Red and White, She∣ries, and indeed the <HI>French</HI> are,
of late, <PB N="164" REF="89"/>very desirous to drink of the strongest
Wines.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ratafia's.</HI></NOTE>Besides Wines,
there is no Feasting without the Drinking at the desert all sorts of
Strong Waters, particularly <HI>Rata∣fia's;</HI> which is a sort of Cherry
Brandy made with Peach and Apricock Stones, highly piquant, and of a most
greeable flavour.</P>
<P>The pungent and acrimonious quality of these and such like
Kernels was not unknown to the Ancients, and very poi∣sonous to some
Animals. <HI>Dioscorides</HI> tells us, a Past made of the Kernels of
<HI>Bitter Almonds</HI> will throw Hens into Convul∣sions, and immediately
kill them. Birds have but little Brain, and so are the stronglier affected
with this Volatil Ve∣nom. Not unlike effect 'tis possible Ra∣tafia may have
in some tender and more delicate Constitutions, and weak and feeble Brains,
and may be one cause of so many sudden Deaths, as have been ob∣served
of late.</P>
<P><HI>Vattee</HI> is a sort of Perfumed Strong∣water from
<HI>Provence,</HI> made (as it is pre∣tended) of Muscat Wine distilled with
Citron Pills and Orange Flowers.</P>
<P><HI>Fenoulliet de l'Isle de Ree,</HI> is valued much, 'tis much
like our Aniseed Water.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="89"/> These and many more sorts of
Strong∣waters, and strong Wines, both of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI>
and <HI>Spain,</HI> are wont to be brought in, at the latter end of the
<HI>De∣sert</HI> in all great Feasts, and they drink freely of them; Which
Custom is new: when I was formerly in <HI>France,</HI> I remem∣ber nothing of
it. But it is the long War that has introduced them, the No∣bility and Gentry
suffering much in those tedious Campagnes, applied them∣selves to these
Liquors to support the Dif∣ficulties and Fatigues of Weather and Watchings;
and at their return to <HI>Paris,</HI> introduced them to their Tables. Sure I
am, the <HI>Parisians,</HI> both Men and Wo∣men, are strangely altered in
their Con∣stitutions and Habit of Body; from lean and slender, they are
become fat and corpulent, the Women especially: Which, in my Opinion, can
proceed from nothing so much as the daily drinking strong Liquors.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Coffee, Tea, Chocolate.</NOTE>Add to these
Drinks the daily use of Coffee with <HI>Sugar,</HI> Tea and Chocolate, which
now is as much in use in Private Houses in <HI>Paris,</HI> as with us in
<HI>London:</HI> And these Sugar'd Liquors also add con∣siderably to
their Corpulency.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="90"/>I must not forget, that amongst the
Drinks that are in use in <HI>Paris, Cyder</HI> from <HI>Normandy</HI> is
one. The best I drank of that Kind, was of the colour of Cla∣ret, reddish
or brown; The Apple, that it was made of, was called <HI>Frequins,</HI> which
is round and yellow, but so bitter, that it is not to be eaten; and yet the
Cyder that is made of it, is as sweet as any new Wine. It keeps many years
good, and mends of its colour and taste. I drank it often at a Private
House of a <HI>Norman</HI> Gentleman, of whose Growth it was; otherwise,
if I had not have to the contrary, I could not have believed, but that it had
been mixt with Sugar.</P>
<P>There are also very many publick <HI>Coffee-houses,</HI> where
Tea also and Choco∣late may be had, and all the Strongwa∣ters and Wine
above-mentioned; and innumerable <HI>Alehouses.</HI> I wonder at the great
change of this Sober Nation, in this particular; but Luxury like a Whirlpool
draws into it the Extravagances of other People.</P>
<P>'Twas Necessity, and the want of Wine, (either naturally, as
in a great part of <HI>Persia</HI> and the <HI>Indies;</HI> or from their
Re∣ligion, <PB N="167" REF="90"/>as in <HI>Turkey,</HI>) that put Men upon the
invention of those Liquors of Coffee and Tea: Chocalate, indeed, was found
out by the poor starved <HI>Indians,</HI> as Ale was with us. But what else
but a Wan∣ton Luxury could dispose these People, who abound in Excellent
Wines, the most cordial and generous of all Drinks, to ape the necessity
of others.</P>
<P>Mighty things, indeed, are said of these Drinks, according to
the Humour and Fancy of the Drinkers. I rather be∣lieve they are permitted by
Gods Provi∣dence for the lessening the number of Mankind by shortning
Life, as a sort of silent Plague. Those that plead for Cho∣colate, say,
it gives them a good Sto∣mach, if taken two hours before Dinner. Right! who
doubts it? you say you are much more hungry having drunk Cho∣colate, than you
had been if you had drunk none; that is, your Stomach is faint, craving and
feels hollow and empty, and you cannot stay long for your Dinner. Things that
pass thus soon out of the Stomach, I suspect are little welcome there,
and Nature makes haste to get shut of them. There are many things of this
sort which impose upon us by procuring a false hunger.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="91"/>The Wild <HI>Indians,</HI> and some of our
People, no doubt digest it; but our Pampered Bodies can make little of it;
and it proves to most tender Constitu∣tions perfect Physic, at least to
the Sto∣mach, by cleansing that into the Gutts; but that wears it out, and
decays Na∣ture.</P>
<P><NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg"><HI>Gage.</HI></NOTE>It is very
remarkable with what gree∣diness the <HI>Spaniards</HI> drink it, and how
often in a day, 5 times says <HI>Gage,</HI> at least. The Women drank it in
the Churches, and the disorder could scarce be remedied.</P>
<P>The old <HI>Romans</HI> did better with their Luxury; they took
their Tea and Choco∣late after a full Meal, and every Man was his own Cook in
that case. <HI>Caesar</HI> resolved to be free, and eat and drink
heartily, that is, to excess, with <HI>Tully;</HI> and for this purpose
<HI>Cicero</HI> tells his Friend <HI>Atticus,</HI> that before he lay down to
Table, <HI>Emeticen agebat,</HI> which I construe, he prepared for himself
his Chocolate and Tea; something to make a quick riddance of what they eat
and drank, some way or other.</P>
<P>There are two sorts of <HI>Water</HI> which they drink at
<HI>Paris;</HI> Water of the <HI>River Seine,</HI> which runs through the Town;
and the Water brought in by the <HI>Aqueduct of <PB N="169" REF="91"/>Arcueil,</HI> which, by the by, is one of the most Magnificent
Buildings in and about <HI>Paris,</HI> and worth going to see: This noble
Canal of hewn Stone conveys the Water 15 miles to <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>The River Water is very pernicious to all Strangers, not the
<HI>French</HI> excepted, that come from any distance, but not to the Natives
of <HI>Paris,</HI> causing Looseness, and sometimes Dysenteries. I am
apt to think, the many <HI>Ponds</HI> and <HI>Lakes</HI> that are let into it
to supply the Sluces upon the Canal <HI>De Briare,</HI> are in part the
cause of it. But those who are careful of themselves purifie it by
filling their Cisterns with Sand, and letting it sink through it; which way
clears it, and makes it very cool and palatable.</P>
<P>As for the Spring Water from the <HI>Maison des Eaux,</HI> it is
wholesom in this respect, and keeps the Body firm; but it is very apt to
give the Stone, which the People of this Town are infinitely sub∣ject to. An
Instance of this I had by chance, when coming from seeing the <HI>Aqueduct
of Arcueil,</HI> in the very Road near the Wall of the <HI>Aqueduct,</HI> a
great number of Earthen Pipes, which had served to convey that Water to
some House, were cast to mend the High-ways. I observed, that of 4
inches diameter the <PB N="170" REF="92"/>hollow of the Pipes were all stopt
up to the breadth of a Shilling, with a firm Stone petrified; so that they
were forc'd to break up the Pipes being altogether useless. Now what
Petrifies in the Water-Pipes is apt in some weak Constitutions to
<HI>Petrifie</HI> also in the <HI>Kidneys</HI> and <HI>Blad∣der.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="section">
<P>In the next place we will see how the <HI>Parisians</HI> divert
themselves; which consists chiefly in Plays, Gameing, Walk∣ing, or
Coaching.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="subsection">
<P>The Plays here are divided into two Houses: One for the
<HI>Operas,</HI> and the other for the <HI>Comedies.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Opera's.</NOTE>I did not see many Opera's,
not being so good a French-Man as to understand them, when Sung: The Opera,
called <HI>l'Europe Gallante,</HI> I was at several times, and it is lookt
upon as one of the very best. It is extreamly fine, and the Mu∣sick and
Singing admirable: The Stage large and magnificent, and well filled with
Actors: The Scenes well suited to the thing, and as quick in the removal of
them, as can be thought. The Dancing exquisite, as being performed by the
best <HI>Masters</HI> of that Profession in Town: The 
<PB N="171" REF="92"/>Cloathing rich, proper, and with great variety.</P>
<P>It is to be wondered, that these Opera's are so frequented:
There are great num∣bers of the Nobility that come daily to them, and some
that can Sing them all: And it was one thing that was trouble∣some to us
Strangers, to disturb the Box by these voluntary Songs of some parts of
the Opera or other; That the Specta∣tors may be said to be here as much
Actors as those imployed upon the ve∣ry Stage.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Comedies.</NOTE>The <HI>Comedies</HI> have
another House in another part of the Town; for the Opera's are under the Roof
of Monsieur, and it is part of the <HI>Palais Royal.</HI></P>
<P>The Disposition of the Theatre is much the same; but
something less: And here the Stage it self is to be Let; where for
<HI>Strangers,</HI> the Places are most commodious, to hear and see.</P>
<P>I heard many <HI>Tragedies,</HI> but without gust for want of
Language: But after them, the <HI>Little Plays</HI> were very Divert∣ing to me,
particularly those of <HI>Moliere, Vendange de Suresne, Pourcegnac,
Crispin Medecin, le Medecin malgre luy, le Malade Imaginaire,
&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="93"/>In this all agree, that tho'
<HI>Moliere</HI>'s Plays have <HI>less of Intrigue</HI> in them; yet his
<HI>Characters</HI> of Persons are incompara∣ble, so true and just, that
nothing can be more: And for this Reason, so many of them are only of two
or three Acts; for without an Intrigue well laid, the Characters would have
failed him, in which was his Excellency. However, this is now so much become
a Custom on the French Stage; that you ever have one of these little Pieces
tack'd to the Trage∣dy, that you may please your self accor∣ding to your
Appetite.</P>
<P>'Tis said, <HI>Moliere</HI> Died suddenly in Acting the
<HI>Malade Imaginaire:</HI> Which is a good instance of his well
Personating the Play he made, and how he could really put himself into any
Passion he had in his Head. Also of the great dan∣ger strong and
vehement Passions may cause in weak Constitutions, such as Joy and
Fear; which History tells us, have killed many very suddenly. He is
re∣ported to have said, going off the Stage, <HI>Messieurs, Jay joue le
Malade Imaginaire; Mais je suis veritablement fort Malade;</HI> and he died
within two hours after. This Account of <HI>Moliere</HI> is not in his Life by
<HI>Perault,</HI> but it is true: And he yet has blamed him for his Folly, in
persecuting <PB N="173" REF="93"/>the Art of Physick, not the Men, in
di∣vers of his Plays.</P>
<P><HI>Moliere</HI> sent for Dr. <HI>M—,</HI> a Phy∣sitian
in <HI>Paris</HI> of great Esteem and Worth, and now in <HI>London,</HI> a
Refuge. Dr. <HI>M—</HI> sent him word, he would come to him, upon two
Conditions; the one, that he should Answer him only to such Questions
as he should ask him, and not otherwise Discourse him; the other, that
he should oblige himself to take the Medecines he should prescribe for
him. But <HI>Moliere</HI> finding the Doctor too hard for him, and not easily
to be <HI>Dupt,</HI> refused them. His Business, it seems, was to make
a Comical Scene in exposing one of the Learnedest Men of the
Profession, as he had done the Quacks. If this was his Intention, as in all
probability it was, <HI>Moliere</HI> had as much Malice, as Wit; which is only
to be used to correct the Vitiousness and Folly of Men pretend∣ing to
Knowledge, and not the Arts themselves.</P>
<P>This I must needs say, That Obsceni∣ty and Immorality are
not at all upon the French Stage, no more than in the Civil Conversation of
People of Fashion and good Breeding.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="94"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">Preaching.</NOTE>One
Afternoon in <HI>Lent,</HI> I was to hear a <HI>Sermon</HI> at <HI>La
Charite,</HI> preached by an <HI>Abbot,</HI> a very young man. His Text was
about the Angels Descent into the Pool of <HI>Bethesda,</HI> and Troubling
the Waters. I am not so good a French-Man as to understand all he said,
but he had many good Arguments about the necessity of Grace, and the means
to attain it. I was strangely surprised at the Vehemen∣cy of his Action,
which to me appeared altogether Comical, and like the Actors upon the Stage,
which I had seen a few days before: Besides, his Expressions seemed
to be in too Familiar a Style: I always took a Sermon to the People to require
a grave and ornate kind of Elo∣quence, and not <HI>Verba Quotidiana,</HI> with
a certain dignity of Action; but 'tis possible this way here best suits
with the Customs and Manners of the People; who are all Motion, even when
they say the easiest and most intelligible Things,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subsection">
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gameing.</NOTE><HI>Gaming</HI> is a perpetual
Diversion here, if not one of the Debauches of the Town: But Games of meer
<HI>Hazard</HI> are strictly forbid upon severe Fines to the Master of
the House, as well private as Publick, where such Playing shall be
discovered. <PB N="175" REF="94"/>This was done upon the Account of the
Officers of the Army; who, during the Winter used to lose the Money, which
was given them to make their Recruits, and renew their Equipages in the Spring.
And indeed, such quick Games, as <HI>Basset, Hazard, &amp;c.</HI> where
Fortune in a manner is all in all, are great Temptations to Ruine, by the
sudden Passions they are apt to raise in the Players: Whereas Games,
where Skill and Cunning, and much Thought are imployed, as well as Luck, give a
Man time to Cool, and re∣cover his Wits, if at any time great Loss shall
have Dismounted his Reason; for he must quickly come to himself again,
or forfeit his Skill and Reputation in Conducting the Game, as well as
Husbanding his Money.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subsection">
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fair of St. <HI>Germains.</HI></NOTE>We were in
<HI>Paris</HI> at the time of the <HI>Fair of St. Germain;</HI> It lasts
six weeks at least: The Place where it is kept well bespeakes its
Antiquity; for it is a very Pit or Hole, in the middle of the
<HI>Fau∣bourg,</HI> and belongs to the Great Abbey of that Name. You Descend
into it on all sides, and in some places above 12 Steps; so that the City
is raised above it 6 or 8 Foot.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="95"/>The Building is a very Barn, or Frame of
Wood, Tiled over; consisting of ma∣ny long Allies crossing one another,
the Floor of the Allies unpaved, and of Earth, and as uneven as may be; which
makes it very uneasie to Walk in, were it not the vast croud of People
which keep you up: But all this bespeaks its Antiquity, and the rudeness of
the first Ages of <HI>Paris,</HI> which is a foil to its Politeness in all
things else now.</P>
<P>The Fair consists of most Toy-shops, and
<HI>Bartholomew</HI>-Fair Ware; also Fiance and Pictures, Joiners Work,
Linnen and Woollen Manufactures; many of the great Ribban Shops remove out of
the Palais hither: No Books: Many Shops of Confectioners, where the Ladies are
com∣modiously Treated.</P>
<P>The great Rendezvous is at night, af∣ter the Play and Opera are
done; and Raffling for all Things Vendible is the great Diversion; no Shop
wanting two or three Raffling Boards. Monsieur, the Dauphin, and other
Princes of the Blood come, at least once in the Fair-time, to Grace it.</P>
<P>Here are also Coffee-Shops, where that and all sorts of
strong Liquors above∣mentioned are to be Sold.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="95"/>Knavery here is in Perfection as with us; as
dextrous Cut-Purses and Pick-Pockets. A Pick-Pocket came into the Fair at
night, extreamly well Clad, with four Lacqueys with good Liveries attend∣ing
him: He was caught in the Fact, and more Swords were drawn in his Defence than
against him; but yet he was taken, and delivered into the Hands of Justice,
which is here sudden and no Jest.</P>
<P>I was surprised at the Impudence of a Booth, which put out the
Pictures of some Indian Beasts with hard Names; and of four that were
painted, I found but two, and those very ordinary ones, <HI>viz.</HI> a
Leopard, and a Racoun. I ask'd the Fellow why he deceived the People, and
whether he did not fear Cudgelling in the end: He answered with a singular
Confidence, that it was the Painter's fault; that he had given the Racoun to
Paint to two Masters, but both had mistaken the Beast; but however, (he
said) tho' the Pictures were not well design'd, they did nevertheless
serve to Grace the Booth and bring him Custom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Elephant.</NOTE>I saw here a Female
<HI>Elephant</HI> betwixt 8 and 9 foot high, very lean and ill kept. Nothing
could be more Docil than this poor Creature. I observed, she bent the 
<PB N="178" REF="96"/>Joints of her Legs very nimbly in making her Salutes to
the Company: Also that the Nails of her Fore-Toes, were large and almost
five Inches long. This was from the Continent, having the Ears <HI>entire.</HI>
I had seen one about 13 years ago in <HI>London</HI> much less, from the
Island of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> of another Species with <HI>Scal∣lopt Ears,</HI>
and the Tail with two rows of large, thick, and stiff black Hairs.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subsection">
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Coaching.</NOTE><HI>Coaching</HI> in Visits
is the great and daily Business of People of Quality: But in the Evenings,
the <HI>Cours de la Reyne</HI> is much frequented, and a great Rendez∣vous of
People of the best Fashion. The Place indeed is very commodious and
pleasant, being three Allies set with high Trees of a great length, all
along the Bank of the River <HI>Seine,</HI> inclosed at each end with noble
Gates; and in the middle a very large Circle to turn in. The mid∣dle Alley
holds four lines of Coaches at least, and each side Alley two a-piece:
These eight lines of Coaches, may, when full, supposing them to contain
near 80 Coaches a-peice, amount to about 6 or 700. On the Field side, joyning
close to the Allies of the Coaches, there are several Acres of Meadow
planted with Trees, well grown, into narrow Allies in <HI>Quin∣cunx</HI> 
<PB N="179" REF="96"/>Order, to walk in the Grass, if any have a mind to
light; and this must needs be very agreeable in the Heats of Summer, which we
staid not to en∣joy.</P>
<P>One thing this <HI>Cours</HI> is short of ours in
<HI>Hide-Park,</HI> for if full, you cannot in an hour see the Company twice
you have a mind to see, and you are confined to your line; and oftentimes,
the Princes of the Blood coming in, and driving at Pleasure, make a strange
stop and em∣barras.</P>
<P>Besides, if the weather has been Rainy, there is no driving in
it, it is so miry and ill gravelled.</P>
<P>Those which have a mind to drive further out of Town for the
Air, have Woods, one to the West, and another to the East, most
convenient. I mean, the <HI>Bois de Bologne,</HI> and the <HI>Bois de
Vin∣cennes;</HI> this last is very opaque and plea∣sant. There are some
Ancient Roman Statues in the first Court of this House.</P>
<P>But for the Castle in the <HI>Bois de Bo∣logne,</HI> called
<HI>Madrid,</HI> it was built by <HI>Francis the First,</HI> and it is
altogether <HI>Moresque,</HI> in imitation of one in <HI>Spain;</HI> with at
least two rows of covered Galle∣ries running quite round, on the out-side
the four faces of the House; which sure <PB N="180" REF="97"/>in a very hot
Country, are greatly re∣freshing and delightful: And this is said to be
built on purpose for a defence a∣gainst a much hotter Climate, than where
it stands; which that King had no mind to visit a second time.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Walking.</NOTE>But let us return to
<HI>Paris;</HI> Towards 8 or 9 a Clock in <HI>June</HI> most of them re∣turn
from the <HI>Cours,</HI> and land at the Garden Gate of the
<HI>Tuilleries,</HI> where they <HI>Walk</HI> in the cool of the Evening. This
Garden is of the best Ordonnance, and now in its full beauty, so that
Mons. <HI>Le Nostre</HI> has seen it in its infancy, for it is all of his
Invention, and he enjoys his Labours in perfection. Certainly the <HI>Moving
Furniture</HI> of it at this time of the Evening, is one of the Noblest
Sights that can be seen. The Night I came a∣way from <HI>Paris,</HI> a Lady
of Quality, Ma∣dam M— when I took my Leave of her, askt me, What I had
seen in <HI>Paris</HI> that most pleased me; I answered her Civil∣ly,
as I ought to do; but she would not take my Compliment, but urged me for a
further Answer: I told her, (since she would have it it so) that I
just then came from seeing what pleased me best; that was, the
<HI>Middle Walk</HI> of the <HI>Tuilleries</HI> in <HI>June,</HI> betwixt 8 and
9 at night; I did <PB N="181" REF="97"/>not think that there was in the World a
more agreeable place than that Alley at that hour, and that time of the
year.</P>
</DIV2>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="section">
<P>And now we are got into the <HI>Gardens</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> I
shall give you a short taste of all of them of Note, at least of such
as I saw.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="subsection">
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tuilleries.</HI></NOTE>This of the
<HI>Tuilleries</HI> is vastly great, has shaded Tarrasses on two
sides, one a∣long the River <HI>Seine,</HI> planted with Trees, very
diverting, with large Parterrs in the middle, and large Fountains of Wa∣ter,
which constantly <HI>play;</HI> one end is the Front of that Magnificent
Palace the <HI>Louvre;</HI> the other is low, and for pro∣spects, open to the
Fields; The rest is disposed into Alleys, and Grass-Plots, and
Copsies of Wood; with a <HI>great number of Seats</HI> upon Down in all
parts, for the Ac∣commodation of the Weary.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Tuilleries</HI> there is one thing which I much liked,
and that was an Amphitheater, with the Stage, Pits and Seats, and the Scenes
leading into the Stage very pretty; from all sides close Alleys leading
into it.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more pleasant than this Garden, where in the
Groves of Wood the latter end of <HI>March, Black Birds,</HI> and 
<PB N="182" REF="98"/><HI>Trostles,</HI> and <HI>Nightingales,</HI> sing
most sweet∣ly all the morning, and that as it were within the City, for no
Birding is suf∣fered here near this City, and the Fields round the Town, are
all, every where, full of Partridges, and Hares, and other Game.</P>
<P>The <HI>Garden</HI> of the <HI>Palais of Luxenburgh</HI> is also
vastly great, and has something of champatre in it, like <HI>St.
James's-Park;</HI> it is also filled with People daily of good Quality; but
because the hard Winters have destroyed many of the Walks, by killing the
Pole Hedges, it is not so fre∣quented, as formerly; yet it hath its Fountains
and Parterres, and some well shaded Allies; and for Air, I prefer it before
the <HI>Tuillieres,</HI> because it is seated upon a high Ground next the
Fields, in the <HI>Faubourgh</HI> of <HI>St. Germains.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Physick Garden.</HI></NOTE>As to the
<HI>King's Physick Garden,</HI> it is a very great Piece of Ground, well
fur∣nisht with Plants, and open also to walk in, to all People of Note.
There is great variety of Ground in it, as Woods, Ponds, Meadows, Mounts,
besides a vast Level, by which it is fitted for the Re∣ception and Growth
of most sorts of Plants.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="98"/>I first saw it in <HI>March</HI> with Dr.
<HI>Turn∣fort,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Breman,</HI> a very Under∣standing and
Painful Gardner. The Green Houses well stored with tender
<HI>Exoticks,</HI> and the Parterrs with <HI>Simples;</HI> though but few of
them then to be seen; yet by the Trees and Shrubs, and some Plants which
did not lose their Heads, I could well judge of the Furniture.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Turnfort</HI> told me, that he shewed a 100 Plants every
Lesson, and he had in the Summer 30 Lessons, which made 3000 Plants;
besides the very early and late Plants, which he reckoned could not be less
than a 1000 more.</P>
<P>I took particular notice of these Plants in the Green Houses
at that time.</P>

<P><PB N="184" REF="99"/>This Garden is endowed by the King and Duke
of <HI>Orleans,</HI> and has 2000<HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR></HI> a year Sterling Rents
belonging to it, where∣of 500<HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR></HI> is given to the chief
Physician who over-looks all, and the rest to the Botanic Reader, Dr.
<HI>Turnfort,</HI> and Under-Gardners, with Lodgings for all.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Breman</HI> told me, he had in the beginning of
<HI>April</HI> made an end of Sow∣ing his Hot Beds, and had put into the Ground
2000 Species of Seed.</P>
<P>From the Mount in the Kings Garden, on the other side the River,
upon the declivity of a high ridge of Hills, I had a fair view of the Palace or
Country-House of <HI>Father la Chaise,</HI> the Kings Con∣fessor; it is
very finely seated against the South Sun, and well Wooded on both sides:
A fit Seat for a Contemplative Person.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Garden of the Palais Royal.</HI></NOTE>The
Garden of the <HI>Palais Royal,</HI> con∣sidering it is in the middle of the
Town, is very large, has 2 or 3 great Basins with their <HI>jet d'Eau,</HI>
but not well kept; nor hath any thing elegant in it, but the good order and
disposition of its shady Walks and Parterrs: It is ever full of good
Company.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="99"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Garden of the Arse∣nal.</HI></NOTE>The
<HI>Garden of the Arsenal</HI> is much larger, and finer kept; has the
prospects of the Fields, and lies open to the Ram∣parts: It is also much
frequented for the beauty of its Walks.</P>
<P>There are also divers Convents which have spatious and well
kept Gardens, which are always open and publick to People of any Note; as the
<HI>Carthusians,</HI> which is vast and Champestre. The
<HI>Ce∣lestins,</HI> very fine and large; That of <HI>St. Genevieve,</HI>
which is great, and very well kept; and the <HI>Tarrasse</HI> for length
and breadth is incomparable, extreamly well planted with
<HI>Horse-chesnuts;</HI> having also on the South side upon the
<HI>Tarrasse,</HI> 3 or 4 square Copses of the same Trees; which have
a marvellous effect for Shade in Summer.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>These <HI>Private Gardens</HI> I saw in
<HI>Paris.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>D'Aumont.</HI> Its <HI>Green House</HI> opened in∣to the
Dining Room: The Orange Trees seemed to have suffered, and had their Leaves
withered; for the Room was too broad by half.</P>
<P>The <HI>Treillage,</HI> at the upper end of the Garden, was very
well adorned with Gilding, and had in the middle a Pavil∣lon, 
<PB N="186" REF="100"/>in which was an old <HI>Roman</HI> Statue of a young Man,
very well preserved: The fashion of the <HI>Toga</HI> here was so
evi∣dent, that it might well pass for a con∣viction to those, who have
thought it to be a Plade, or a Garment open before like a Cloak.</P>
<P>This Treillage is performed with that variety of Ornaments, that
it resembles Filegreen Work, and is large. The Painting of these Works in
green is not well performed in all places alike; it is either too yellow, or of
a sad dirty green, or Sea green; few have hit the right Grass green colour.
To do it well, it is to be primed in yellow, and then to be covered with
<HI>Vert de Montagne</HI> or <HI>La∣pis Armeniacus;</HI> of which last colour
we have plenty in <HI>England</HI> about <HI>Maulham</HI> in <HI>Craven</HI> in
<HI>Yorkeshire.</HI></P>
<P>This is the great benefit of Treillage in Cities, that besides
the beauty of it to the Eye, it takes away and hides the ill prospect of the
Neighbouring Houses.</P>
<P>Here were very many <HI>Fig-Trees</HI> well grown in square
Boxes; and Parterrs well stockt with Flowers; each sort by them∣selves;
as <HI>Tulips</HI> a-part; <HI>Junkills</HI> a-part; <HI>Anemonies</HI> a-part;
<HI>Ranunculus</HI>'s a-part; <HI>Daffadills</HI> a-part.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="100"/><HI>Puissart.</HI> This Garden is very
neat, and open at the end to the <HI>Tuilleries.</HI> The <HI>Treillage</HI>
Walk or Arbor at the upper end is very fine, 70 Paces long, and 8 broad, hath 3
Pavillons all open at the top. It is all of Iron, painted green, and cost
15000 Livers.</P>
<P>The Gardner was an Artist; and had some Plants in Cases in
good order, not to be seen elsewhere, as large Rosemary Bushes,
Jacobaea Maritima, Marum Syriacum, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Walls were well covered with Fruit Trees; he had not cut his
Peaches; when I askt him the reason, he told me, it was his way, not to cut
them till after flowring, which he found by Experience to improve the Fruit;
whereas he said, the early cutting Stockt them, and im∣paired the Fruit.</P>
<P>The <HI>Orangery</HI> here was the most beau∣tiful Room, for the
bigness, I had seen, paved with Marble, and neatly Wain∣scoted with Oak,
from the top to the bot∣tom, after our <HI>English</HI> manner. I make no
doubt it served to eat in in Summer, when cleared of Trees.</P>
<P><HI>Bouvillier.</HI> I found not any thing more remarkable here
than the Trellage at the end.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="101"/><HI>Comartin.</HI> The Trellage in this
Garden was most admirable in the fashion of a Triumphal Arch; half of it
was an <HI>A∣viarie,</HI> with a Fountain in it, well stor'd with Birds.</P>
<P>Here were large Iron <HI>Vasa</HI>'s upon Pe∣destals, the
first I had seen of the Kind, painted over of a Copper colour.</P>
<P><HI>Les Diguieres.</HI> This is the only House in
<HI>Paris,</HI> I saw kept in all the parts of it, with the most exact
cleanliness and neatness, Gardens and all.</P>
<P>In the Garden there were several pieces of Trellage; that at the
upper end was very noble, and cost 10000 Livres; an∣other piece of it cost
6000. But I saw a small one all of Iron-leaves painted green, the only one
of the Kind. Here also were <HI>great Vasa's of Trelliage</HI> upon
Pede∣stals.</P>
<P>The Fountains in this Garden were very curious, though small,
with proper Or∣naments, which had a marvellous effect, when the Spouts plaied
off.</P>
<P>The first Court was set about with Cases of extraordinary
large <HI>Laurus Tinus,</HI> and in the Gardens there were some cut into
square Pyramids.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="101"/>A Person of Quality came into the Garden
to me, who with great Civility conducted me up to the Apartments.</P>
<P>In the Apartment of the Dutchess, which was all of her own
Contrivance, and had an Air of State and Agreeable∣ness beyond any thing I
had seen, I observed hanging down in the middle of the Bed-chamber the
finest Crystal Candle∣stick in <HI>France:</HI> The Pieces were all
bought single by her, and the Contrivance and setting them together was her
own; it cost 12000 Crowns.</P>
<P>But before I left the Garden, in an obscure Parterre I saw the
Tomb of a Cat, <HI>viz.</HI> a Black Cat Couchant upon a White Marble
Cushion, fringed with Gold, and Gold Tassels hanging at the corners upon
a square Black Marble Pe∣destal: On one of the sides of that Marble is
writ in Letters of Gold. 
<Q> 
<L><HI>Cy gist Menine la plus aimable &amp; la</HI></L> 
<L><HI>Plus aimee de toutes les chattes.</HI></L></Q> On the
other side. 
<Q> 
<L><HI>Cy gist une chatte jolie</HI></L> 
<L><HI>Sa maistresse qui n'aimoit rien</HI></L> 
<L><HI>L'aime jusques à la follie</HI></L> 
<L><HI>Pour quoy dire! on le voit bien</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="102"/> This is not the first Instance of this
kind of folly; I have seen something of it in <HI>England;</HI> and have
read much more in History.</P>
<P>If you blame me for Transcribing this Epitaph, I will submit;
but I could ne∣ver have forgiven my self, if I had Tran∣scribed the many
fine Inscriptions I met with at <HI>Paris,</HI> though in most Elegant and
truly <HI>Roman</HI> Words; others in pure Court <HI>French.</HI> You may read
them in the <HI>Description of Paris.</HI></P>
<P><HI>De Lorge.</HI> We had the good fortune here to find the
Marshal himself walking in his Garden; who Entertained us with great
Civility, <HI>viz.</HI> the Dean of <HI>Win∣chester</HI> and my self. This
Garden was not finisht, and the House it self was but building; but it is
one of the finest in <HI>Paris,</HI> and has the advantage of a most free
and extended prospect of the Fields and <HI>Montmarter:</HI> At the end of
the Gar∣den rises a Tarrass equal with the Ram∣part.</P>
<P>That which was in this House and Garden very commodious and
noble was, that betwixt the two Courts the Coaches drive through a stately
Hall upon Pillars, and might land on either side, up a step 
<PB N="191" REF="102"/>or two, which leads to the Staircases and other
Apartments; and then in the fur∣thest Court, which is only divided from the
Garden by high Pallasadoes of Iron, they turn, and take up the Company
a∣gain; so that no Weather offends them. Which is much wanting here; and more
with us at <HI>London,</HI> where we most need it.</P>
<P>This Hall is open upon Arches to the Garden, and the Staircase
it self is so contrived, that you enjoy a full prospect of the Garden and
<HI>Montmarter</HI> in descend∣ing.</P>
<P>The Marshal very obligingly shewed us his own Apartment; for
all the rest of the House was full of Workmen; and in his Bedchamber his
little <HI>Red Damask Field Bed,</HI> which he lay in now, and which also
served him, when he com∣manded upon the <HI>Rhine.</HI></P>
<P>He shewed us his great <HI>Sash Windows;</HI> how easily
they might be lifted up and down, and stood at any height; which Contrivance
he said he had out of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> by a small Model brought on
pur∣pose from thence: There being nothing of this <HI>Poise</HI> in Windows
in <HI>France</HI> be∣fore.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="103"/>He also had us into a Set of small
Closets or Rooms, after the <HI>English</HI> fashi∣on, very prettily
furnished, neatly kept, and retired, with his <HI>English</HI> Keys to
them, as he told us; and from thence we descended a back Pair of Stairs: We
did all we could to hinder him from see∣ing us take Coach: He sent his Page
af∣ter us, to invite us some day to Eat with him.</P>
<P><HI>Hostel Pelitier.</HI> The Garden here was very neat, with a
Trelliage at the end after the manner of a Triumphal Arch, but not very high,
nor well Painted; yet its Beauty and Finishings differ much from any I had
seen before. In the two Niches were plac'd great Iron Vasa's or Flower
Pots, right before the middle of a Basin of Water, which was set a Playing
for our Entertainment, which is a Com∣pliment the French are willing to ob∣lige
Strangers with.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Orangerie</HI> were very large Trees, and two pair of
Mirtles in Cases, cut Globe-wise, the best and biggest I had seen:
Large Bushes in Pots of <HI>Marum Sy∣riacum.</HI> Great store of Tulips,
Anemo∣nies, Ranunculus, and other Flowers in Beds, in the Parterre, each by
them∣selves.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="103"/>Also Anemonies and Ranunculus's in little
Earthen Pots, as with us; but in very light Mold. Great and very fair
<HI>Laurus Tinus's</HI> in Cases. And, which was singular, a-long one of
the Garden Walls were planted <HI>Abel Trees,</HI> whose tops were
disposed and spread by an Iron Trelliage into Arches at equal
distances, which had a very good effect.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hostel-sul∣lie.</HI></NOTE>The Garden
of the <HI>Hostel-sullie</HI> had no∣thing remarkable in it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Louvois.</HI></NOTE>The best Piece of
Treillage of Iron Bars and Wood intermixt, is that in the <HI>Garden of feu
Mons. Louvois.</HI> And this is one of the neatest Gardens in
<HI>Paris.</HI> The whole upper end is adorned with a noble Treillage after the
manner of a Triumphal Arch; it cost a great Sum of Money: There are 4 Statues
disposed on Pedestals under it, which have a good effect; these are
Antique, rarely good. One of the first Empresses, a <HI>Diana,</HI> an
<HI>Apollo, &amp;c.</HI> Here the Walks are hard Gravel, but not Rowled. On one
side of the Treillage is a large <HI>Aviary</HI> well stored with
Birds.</P>
<P>The Walls of the Green House are <HI>Matted;</HI> and large
<HI>Pans of Iron</HI> hang down in the middle of the House, at 
<PB N="194" REF="104"/>equal distances, to every Window one; They have Pullies
to let them down or run them up to what height they please. This way may very
well correct the moistness of the Air, which the <HI>breath of the</HI>
Plants cause, and sufficiently warm them. Hot Beds puff up Plants; yet a
warm Air over their Heads may be as useful to re∣fresh and nourish them
in Winter.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Furnier.</HI></NOTE>The last Private
Garden I saw, was that of Mr. <HI>Furnier,</HI> a few days before we left the
Town, nothing could be pret∣tier. At the upper end a noble <HI>Treillage,</HI>
two great Vasa's of Iron painted of a Brass∣colour and gilt.</P>
<P>Here I saw an <HI>Apple Tree</HI> Potted, as the Figs and
Oranges use to be; it was the White Queenen, (or <HI>Calvil d'Este</HI>)
the Stem of the bigness only of my Thumb, full of Fruit the first of
<HI>June.</HI></P>
<P>Many Pots of <HI>Sedum Pyramidale,</HI> now a most elegant
Ornament. But nothing is here so pompous as <HI>double red and stript
stockes;</HI> which they multiply with care; and their Pains are justly
Rewarded. With a thousand other things, which my short turn in the Garden
would not give me leave to remember.</P>
<P>There are great numbers of these Pri∣vate Gardens in
<HI>Paris,</HI> which deserve <PB N="195" REF="104"/>seeing; but the
Season of the year not much favouring our Curiosity, we did not much
enquire after them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subsection">
<P>Hitherto I have given a short Account of what I saw mostly
in <HI>Paris,</HI> as to the People, abroad and at home; The Coun∣try, round
about it, is full of populous and neat Towns, and many Palaces of the King and
Princes of the Blood; which are not to be equalled with any thing we have in
<HI>England.</HI> But I am unwilling to lead you any further, it being much out
of my way and humour to go to Court; but because it was my fortune to be at
<HI>Versailles, St. Clou, Marli,</HI> and <HI>Meudon,</HI> I will venture to
say something of each.</P>
<P>These 4 Royal Palaces and their Gar∣dens possess a barren
and hilly Country, as big as most Counties in <HI>England:</HI> Two of them,
<HI>Meudon</HI> and <HI>St. Cloud,</HI> have the Prospect of <HI>Paris</HI>
under them; but the former hath it much more open and fully, than the
latter.</P>
<P>This District may be said to be <HI>Le Ber∣ceau des Roys,</HI>
or the Nursery of Kings; for the chief of the Blood Royal are lodged here,
<HI>viz.</HI> the King, Monseigneur the Dauphin, and the 3 Grandsons, the
Dukes of <HI>Burgundy, d'Anjou,</HI> and <HI>Berry,</HI> Monsieur or the
Kings Brother, and his Son the Duke of <HI>Charlres,</HI> and Mademoi∣selle 
<PB N="196" REF="105"/>his Daughter. All these are, or will be (as it is
easie to guess by the growth and proportions of the youngest) very large
and well shaped beautiful People. The other Branch of the Blood Royal, of the
House of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> as the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> the Duke of
<HI>Bourbon,</HI> and the Princesses his Daughters, the Prince of
<HI>Conti,</HI> are all of less Stature, but very well shaped and
handsom.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>du Maine</HI> and the <HI>Conte de Toulouse</HI> I
did not see; but the Princess Dowager of <HI>Conti</HI> often, who is
without dispute one of the most graceful and handsomest Women in
<HI>France,</HI> and me∣thinks exceedingly like the King her Fa∣ther, as I
remember him in his full beau∣ty, when I first saw him in the year-65.</P>
<P>These 4 Palaces are all intirely built and furnisht in this
Kings time, and all the Gardens, and what belongs to them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>St. Clou.</HI></NOTE><HI>St. Clou</HI> is
the nearest <HI>Paris,</HI> and the Castle is very magnificent, and most
commodious. The Great <HI>Salon</HI> and the <HI>Gallery</HI> are extreamly
well Painted.</P>
<P>The Gardens are a vast Extent, 12 or 15 miles in compass.</P>
<P>The Natural <HI>Woods</HI> on the South-west side the House,
are well Husbanded, and cut into small and bigger Alleys, to save 
<PB N="197" REF="105"/>the Trees; which they have had so great a care of, they
have kept them standing not only in the Alleys, but in the very <HI>Steps of
Stone,</HI> which are made to descend into the Alleys.</P>
<P>In the other parts of the Garden the Al∣leys are mostly treble,
and well shaded, run out in vast lengths of several miles, every where
<HI>Basins and Jetts d'eau;</HI> but there is a <HI>Cascade,</HI> which I
saw several times play, and is said to be the most beautiful and best
furnisht with Water of any in <HI>France.</HI> In the middle of the large
Ba∣sin amongst the Woods, I saw a <HI>Jet d'eau,</HI> which threw up a
Spout of Water 90 foot high, and did discharge it self with that force,
that it made a mist and cool∣ness to the Air a great compass round about,
and gave now and then cracks like the going off of a Pistol; such force the
vent of Wind in the Pipes had.</P>
<P>The Pipes which convey the Water are composed of Iron Cylinders
3 foot long, some 10, some 20 inches diameter, till they divide; and then
they are of Lead.</P>
<P>I was once kindly invited to <HI>St. Clou</HI> by Madam's
Physician, Monsieur <HI>Arlot,</HI> who sent his Coach for me to
<HI>Paris,</HI> and nobly Treated me: Before Dinner he carried me in his Coach
(for this privi∣ledge <PB N="198" REF="106"/>is granted him) into all parts, and
round the Gardens; which were well furnisht with Alleys and Walks, adorn∣ed
with Cypress, Pines, and Firrs, cut into Pyramids; and Water-Works every
where playing in abundance, particu∣larly the <HI>Gerbes d'eau</HI> were very
fine, that is, great and thick, seeming Streams of Water thrown up into the
Air; This is done to husband the Water by a great number of small Pipes like
a <HI>Sheaf,</HI> to re∣present a solid Pillar of Water.</P>
<P><HI>Monsieur</HI> has added, and taken into this vast Garden,
a new acquisition of a <HI>Mountainous Plain,</HI> which over-looks all the
Country round; and will, no doubt, when it is modelled by that admirable
Contriver <HI>Mons. le Nostre,</HI> make one of the most delightful
Places in the World.</P>
<P>From the Balustrade in the Upper Gar∣den, the River
<HI>Seine,</HI> and a vast Plain bounded by <HI>Paris,</HI> is to be seen,
and makes a most delightful Prospect.</P>
<P>These vast <HI>riding Gardens</HI> are unknown to us in
<HI>England,</HI> and <HI>se promener a che∣val, on en carosse,</HI> is
not <HI>English.</HI> We can∣not afford to lose so much Country, as
those Gardens take up. I see in some of the Quarters not only Partridge
and Hares plentifully, but, which I wonder∣ed at, 5 <HI>Biches</HI> or Female
Red-Deer feed∣ing.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="106"/>The <HI>Orangery</HI> belonging to this
Garden is very large and magnificent, paved with Marble, and was filled with
vast Trees in Cases, not to be brought in or out without proper Engines,
but in it there was nothing but those Orange Trees, Oleanders, and Laurus
Tinus's. He goes out of the end of his Appartment, that is, the noble painted
Gallery is conti∣nued upon a level with the Orangery, which leads directly into
an ascending Walk of a vast length; and also fronts or flanks all along
the Parterre or Flower Garden; where they are disposed of in Summer. At
this Treat I eat of a Preserve or Wet Sweetmeat, made of Orange Flowers,
incomparable; and the Lady obliged me with the manner of making it.</P>
<P>Though there were high and proper Walls for Fruit in many parts of
the Garden, yet nothing of that nature was to be found, only ordinary and
<HI>in∣fructiferous Greens</HI> were fastned to the Treillage, which are the
Linings of most Walls here. In the Garden are many Arbours of Treillage,
Pavillons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Iron mixt with Wood, painted Green, with Honey
Suckles running up them. These Gardens have above 150 People always imployed
to keep them in or∣der; <PB N="200" REF="107"/>which stands in 40000 Livres a
year.</P>
<P>Another time I Dined with the Captain of the Castle, who
shewed me all the Apartments at leisure. I eat here of the Red Leg'd
Partridge taken here upon these Hills; They are much less here than in
<HI>Languedoc,</HI> but yet far better tasted, than the Grey Partridges taken
in the same place. This was the beginning of <HI>April,</HI> and we drank our
Wine in Ice, which I was not aware off, till I found the bad effect of it in my
Throat; and the next day much more; but it went off again without any great
trouble. There is no Animal that abuses it self in Meat and Drink, as Man
does; we daily drink excessive hot and excessive cold; in other
Creatures it's Instinct that guides them, but as for us we neither act by
Instinct, nor Reason; but betwixt both <HI>loosely,</HI> and therefore
oftner are catcht, to our own destruction.</P>
<P>At the end of the Apartments of <HI>Monsieur,</HI> are a fine
Set of Closets; The first you enter is furnisht with great va∣riety of
Rock Crystals, Cups, Agats up∣on small Stands, and the sides of the Rooms
are lined with large Panes of Looking-glass from top to the bottom, with
Japan Varnish and Paintings of e∣qual <PB N="201" REF="107"/>breadth
intermixt; which had a marvellous pretty effect. The other Room had in it a
vast quantity of <HI>Bijou,</HI> and many of very great Price; but the
<HI>Siam Pagods,</HI> and other things from thence, were very odd.</P>
<P>There was also one very small <HI>Roman Statue</HI> of White
Marble, not 10 inches high, which cost 20000 Crowns; one Leg of it was a
little injured. It seemed a Piece of admirable Workmanship. It was a
<HI>Boy,</HI> who had in the Skirt of his Tunic <HI>a Litter of Puppies,</HI>
and the <HI>Bitch</HI> lying at his feet and looking up.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Meudon.</HI></NOTE>I cannot say much of
<HI>Meudon,</HI> because I was not within the House or Park; it will
require yet some time to bring it to that perfection which is designed, for
that Monseigneur has been but lately possessed of it; The Road from
<HI>Paris</HI> to it is yet un∣paved; but the Situation is admirable, and the
<HI>Splanade</HI> before the House is like a vast Bastion, and commands
the full view of all the Campagne, and <HI>Paris</HI> under it. The Gardens are
very great, but I only coasted them, and the House.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Versailles.</HI></NOTE>As to the Palace
of <HI>Versailles,</HI> (which is yet some miles further within the
Moun∣tainous Country, not unlike <HI>Black-Heath</HI> <PB N="202" REF="108"/>or
<HI>Tunbridge</HI>) 'tis without dispute the most magnificent of any in
<HI>Europe;</HI> Yet what of it was first built, and much admired 30 years
ago, is now no longer relisht: However this King intends to rebuild it, where
it is faulty. 'Tis, as I said, plac'd in a very ungrateful Soil, without
Earth proper for Herbs, or Water; but he hath brought that to it in abundance,
and made the Ground too to be fruitful.</P>
<P>There are Books writ to describe this famous Palace in every
part; to which I refer the Reader. The Way to it is new, and in some places
the Mountains are cut down 40 foot, so that now you enjoy it a mile in
prospect before you come to it; it opens and closes in 3 Courts, the more
remotest narrower and narrower; which is a fault; and is, as I was told,
designed to be pulled down, and made into one noble large square Court of
the same or∣der of building, as that magnificent Front is, which looks upon
the Gardens. The Gilded Tiles and Roof have a marvellous effect in prospect.
The Splanade towards the Gardens and Parterres are the no∣blest things that
can be seen, vastly great, with a very large Basin of Water in the
middle, walled round with white Marble, on which are placed a great number of
incomparable Brazen Vasa, and large <PB N="203" REF="108"/>Brass Figures
<HI>couchant,</HI> of the best Masters in Sculpture; it were endless to
tell all the Furniture of these Gardens of Marble Statues, and Vasa of
Brass and Marble, the multitude of Fountains, and those wide Canals like
Seas running in a streight line from the bottom of the Gardens, as far as the
Eye can reach.</P>
<P>In a Word, these Gardens are a Coun∣trey laid out into Alleys
and Walks, Groves of Trees, Canals and Fountains, and every where adorned with
ancient and modern Statues and <HI>Vasa</HI> innumer∣able.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> the 17th the Waters were order∣ed to Play for the
Diversion of the <HI>En∣glish</HI> Gentlemen. The Playing of the Spouts of
Water, thrown up into the Air, is here diversified after a thousand
fashions. The <HI>Theatre des eaux,</HI> and the <HI>Triumphal Arch</HI> are
the most famous Pieces. But in the Groves of the Left Hand, you have
<HI>Aesop's Fables,</HI> in so many Pieces of Water-Works, here and there
in Wind∣ing-Alleys. This might have been said to be done <HI>in Ʋsum
Delphini.</HI> 'Tis pretty to see the Owle washt by all the Birds; the
<HI>Munkie</HI> hugging her young one, till it spouts out Water with a full
Throat, and open Mouth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="109"/>The <HI>Orangery,</HI> or Winter
Conservato∣ry for Tubs of Winter Greens, is what corresponds to the
greatness of the rest. 'Tis a stupendious <HI>half square</HI> of
under∣ground Vaults, like the Naves of so many Churches put together, of
exquisite Work∣manship in hewn Stone, well lighted and open to the South
Sun. It contains 3000 Cases of Greens; whereof near 2000 are Orange Trees,
and many hun∣dreds of them are as big as generally they naturally grow in the
Earth: Hence amongst them are some, which are said to be in Cases from
the time of <HI>Francis</HI> the First.</P>
<P>They did not think fitting to put them out this year till the
latter end of <HI>May;</HI> and indeed their Oleanders, Laurels,
Len∣tiscus's, and most other Greens, had suf∣fered miserably.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Pottagerie</HI> (which is part of these Gardens, and
hath its magnificence also) there are 700 Cases of <HI>Figs,</HI>
be∣sides Wall Fruit of all other Kinds: By all the Gardens in and about
<HI>Paris,</HI> I per∣ceived they are very fond of this Fruit.</P>
<P>I observed in small Fiance or Painted Pots a vast number of
the narrow leaved <HI>Laurus Alexandrina;</HI> also <HI>Thlapsi flore albo,
Leucoii folio latifolium;</HI> also the <HI>Sedum Py∣ramidale;</HI> These
are not yet Ornaments in our Gardens, that I know of.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="109"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Marli.</HI></NOTE>The 15th of <HI>May</HI>
my Lord Ambassa∣dor went to <HI>Marli,</HI> where the Waters played for his
Diversion.</P>
<P>I must needs say it is one of the plea∣santest Places I
ever saw, or, I believe, is in <HI>Europe;</HI> it is seated in the bosom
or upper end of a high Valley, in the midst of and surrounded with Woody
Hills. The Valley is closed at the upper end, and gently descends forwards
by degrees, and opens wider and wider, and gives you the prospect of a vast
plain Coun∣trey, and the River <HI>Seine</HI> running through it.</P>
<P><HI>Marli</HI> is a square House raised upon Steps, and
Terrassed on all sides; The 4 Fronts all alike; and the Doors opening
into the Garden all the same. In the middle <HI>an Octogon-hall,</HI> running
up Dome-wise, in which all the side Rooms meet; which are all Rooms of
State. Above are 12 Lodgings, with a narrow Gallery leading to them. In the
lower Rooms at <HI>Marli,</HI> particularly in the <HI>Octogon Salan,</HI> are
extraordinary large (6 foot at least) Marble, or rather <HI>Agat Tables;</HI>
To the best of which they may be compared. They are veined like Wood, and of
an Amber colour; These are the admirable effect of Petrification. Of this
very <PB N="206" REF="110"/>Stone I have seen great Blocks in the Banks of the
<HI>Dropping Well</HI> at <HI>Knaresbo∣rough</HI> in <HI>Yorkeshire.</HI> I
forgot to ask here whence they had them.</P>
<P>In one of the Ground Rooms was a Semicircular <HI>Gilt Bar</HI> or
Rail, which took off and inclosed the upper end of the Room: Within the Bar
was disposed se∣veral Rows of Porcellain or fine China on Gilt Shelves.
Here at the Corners, within the Bar, opened two small Doors, whence the
Ambassador and his Retinue were plentifully served with Chocolate, Tea,
and Coffee, in a most obliging man∣ner; Many of the Nobility and Gentle∣men
of <HI>France</HI> were ordered to attend him there.</P>
<P>The two side Fronts of the House have in prospect great
Alleys cut through the Woods, and paved for the more com∣modious coming down to
the House; which is descending all the way.</P>
<P>On each side the Valley, close under the Woods, run along in a
line, six square Pavillons or smaller Palaces of the very same figure
and beauty with the <HI>Mother House;</HI> at equal, but large distances,
as 500 Paces. The 6 on the right hand the Garden are for the Men; The other 6
on the left are for the Women of Quality; whom the King weekly appoints, upon 
<PB N="207" REF="110"/>a List given, to attend him, and enjoy the Pleasure
of this Retirement, as I may say, from Court. Before those Pavil∣lons, and
betwixt them, are the finest Alleys and Walks imaginable, with Foun∣tains,
and all the Decorations of Treil∣lage and Flowers. Such a shew of <HI>not
ordinary Tulips</HI> in broad Beds, of a 1000 Paces long, every where, all this
vast Garden over, in their full beauty, was a most surprising sight.
I could not for∣bear to say to the Duke <HI>de Villeroy,</HI> who was
pleased much to accompany me in this Walk, That sure all the Gardens in
<HI>France</HI> had contributed to this Profusion of Flowers; which he took
so well, that the <HI>Marishal his Father;</HI> afterwards de∣tached
himself to single me out, and very obligingly embraced me, and sa∣luted
me with a Kiss, and followed it with very kind and familiar
Discourse.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cascade</HI> coming down from the brow of the Hill, on
that Front of the House which respects and stands near it, was new and
singular, and of the Kings own invention, as, indeed, all the Gar∣den
besides. From the House it appeared a <HI>Broad River,</HI> quietly gliding
down the Hill; but when I went near it, I found it composed of 52 large
square and shal∣low Basins of Water, disposed at right 
<PB N="208" REF="111"/>Angles, and not declining, but falling over one into
another.</P>
<P>In the Garden were many Fountains, nobly adorned, and had variety
of Wa∣ter Pipes playing up into the Air in them. Here are some
<HI>Gerbes</HI> of a singular fashi∣on, with a Circle of a great num∣ber of
large Pipes, within at least two foot diameter; which made the appea∣rance of
a vast Pillar of Water. There was one <HI>Jet d'eau</HI> in the bottom of the
Garden, which we were told threw up Water 120 foot high; for of 50 and more
Fountains, we saw but those on the side Alleys to play; most of the
great Basins in the middle were mending, and dry. To furnish all this
Water, there is a most stupendious <HI>Machine,</HI> which was invented by
2 <HI>Liegois.</HI> This Machine forces the Water up 560 foot, from the River
<HI>Seine,</HI> to the top of the Tower or Aqueduct. It throws up 500 inches of
Water by almost continued Ructations, or quick Pulses. It is wrought by 14
Wheels of 32 feet diameter each, set in the River, and carried about night
and day by its Stream.</P>
<P>This Invention is the same with what is practised in the deep
Coal-pits about <HI>Leeds</HI> in <HI>Lower-Germany;</HI> so that to see
the Engines, and a great number of Iron <PB N="209" REF="111"/>Cylinders or
Water Pipes, lying bare <HI>above ground,</HI> and running up a vast
Mountain, is to imagine a deep Coal-Mine turned wrongside outward.</P>
<P>The Tree most in use here, was the small leaved
<HI>Horne-Beam;</HI> which serves for <HI>Arcades, Berceaus;</HI> and also
<HI>Standards</HI> with Globular Heads: At the foot of which they have planted
little <HI>Sprigs</HI> of the same of a foot and half high; and also in
some places in like manner, whole <HI>areas</HI> full of them; which cut
smooth and level, make the finest <HI>green Hedges</HI> I ever saw; Some
of these low Hedges were 12 foot broad, and in a barren and dry Climate
supply very artificially the use of <HI>Grass∣plots.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis certainly very commendable in the King, who pleases
himself in Plant∣ing and Pruning the Trees with his own Hand, to make use
of no other Trees, but what the Neighbouring Woods afford; so that 'tis
admirable to see whole Alleys of <HI>Pole Hedges</HI> of great height, and
long Rows of goodly Standard Globes of 18 months growth only.</P>
<P>If this great King, as he grows older, should take a fancy to
place himself in a <HI>warmer Climate,</HI> (and he has a good one of his
own, as any under the Sun, in <HI>Languedoc</HI>) as he does his Winter Greens 
<PB N="210" REF="112"/>in proper Houses; (and, me-thinks, this Instance
alone should be sufficient, to convince him of the necessity there is
to cherish decaying Nature, and that a Na∣turally warm Air is a better fence,
than Cloaths or Fire) what Wonders would not his Purse and Passion for
Planting do there?</P>
<P>The next Woods in <HI>Languedoc</HI> would afford <HI>Laurel,</HI>
and <HI>Myrtles</HI> for Pole Hedges; <HI>Lentiscus's</HI> and
<HI>Phylarea's</HI> in as great abun∣dance, as Hazel or Thorn with us. Also
<HI>Jasmins</HI> for Arbors and <HI>Treillage; Cistus's</HI> and
<HI>Rosmary,</HI> and a hundred other sweet smelling Woody Shrubs grow
every where in the Fields, to furnish the <HI>Pots</HI> and
<HI>Vasa.</HI></P>
<P>There the tall <HI>Cypres's</HI> grow of them∣selves, to 60 and
100 foot high, like so many Towers; and also <HI>Tonsil</HI> at
plea∣sure, for the most beautiful Pole Hedges imaginable. The very Fields
are most Excellent, and well furnisht Parterrs of Flowers, and are
Naturally Pottageries, or Kitchin Gardens. The Vineyards are very Orchards; and
all the most tender Fruits with us are there <HI>Standards;</HI> as Figs, and
Grapes of all sorts, Apricocks, Peaches, Nectorins, Jujubs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
The de∣licious and large Cherries; and, what∣ever has been said to the
contrary, Pipins <PB N="211" REF="112"/>and Pears there are in far greater
per∣fection, than with us, or in any parts of <HI>France</HI> else, besides
that happy Climate.</P>
<P>What was it for so great a King to make a Walk from
<HI>Marli</HI> to <HI>Montpelier,</HI> or (if I might choose) to
<HI>Pescenas,</HI> seated in the bosom of a well Watered Valley,
inclosed with <HI>perfumed Hills.</HI> 'Tis not half so far as betwixt
<HI>Lahor</HI> and <HI>Agria,</HI> two Seats the <HI>Mogul</HI> has thus
joined. This would Eternise his Name, above any Palace he has yet built, and
bring to himself much Health in his old Age. The Gardens of the
<HI>Hesperides,</HI> and the <HI>Labyrinths of Cande,</HI> so famous in
History, would be nothing to such wonderful Performances, as his Abilities
and Happy Genius is capable of. For besides the Natural Product of the
Countrey, the Climate also is capable of producing, and nourishing with
small Art and Expence, what ever Plants both the <HI>Indies</HI> can af∣ford.
Whereas, at this end of the World, we drudge in vain; and force a Pleasure
which is dead, and gone before we can well enjoy it: We have indeed a kind of
shew of the Summer Delights, but all on a suddain we drop into a long and
tedious Winter again. But we love the Places we are used to, or born in. Man,
to say the truth, is a very Animal, <PB N="212" REF="113"/>as any Quadrupede
of them all; and most of his Actions are resolvable into Instinct,
notwithstanding the Principles which Custom and Education have
super∣induced.</P>
<P>The pleasure of seeing is scarce to be tired; but yet after
2 or 3 hours Walk in so fine and great a Garden, I was forc't to make a halt
behind the Com∣pany, and glad to retire to the gilt <HI>Bu∣reau</HI> in the
Palace again, to refresh my self; where I found some of the Kings
Officers waiting, and some other Gentle∣men of the Houshold, who had made
se∣veral Campagnes in <HI>Flanders.</HI> I had now more a mind to a Glass
of cool <HI>Burgun∣dy,</HI> than the insignificant <HI>Indian</HI> Liquors;
which though I knew was against the sanctity of the place, yet nothing was
denied me a Stranger. Here being alone, we fell into Discourse of the
<HI>English,</HI> and of their King. They willingly allowed the
<HI>English</HI> to be truly Brave; and now in Peace they found also, that
they were as Civil, and well Bred, as Brave; That no Nation had given the King
and his Court that satisfaction, that the <HI>English</HI> had done; being
curious and inquisitive after all good things; They did see a great
difference betwixt them and other Nations; They did not stare, and
care∣lessly <PB N="213" REF="113"/>run about, or hold up their Heads, and
despise what they saw; but had a true relish of every good thing, and
made a good Judgment of what was Commendable; and therefore the King took
pleasure to have them shewed e∣very thing. This Discourse of the
<HI>En∣glish</HI> they concluded with a great Enco∣mium of K.
<HI>William.</HI></P>
<P>As for their own King they were much in the Praise of him, as
one may easily imagine: That his Retirement hither was mostly for his
Health; That he left <HI>Versailles</HI> every <HI>Tuesday</HI> night, and
came hither with a select Company of Lords and Ladies; That he returned not
till <HI>Saturday</HI> night, and sometimes inter∣mitted 10 or 14 days; so
that he spent half of his time here in Repose; That he was the most
affable Prince in the World, and never out of Humour, of a pleasant and open
Conversation where it pleased him; easie of access, and never sent
any one away discontented; The most Bountiful Master in the World, of
which there were Ten thousand Instances; nothing of Merit in any Kind, but
he most readily and chearfully Rewarded, ever, of late years at least,
preferring the Virtuous; so on the other hand, he never spared the
Rebellious and Obstinate; That the <PB N="214" REF="114"/>Government of his
People could not be carried on with less severity and strict∣ness; nor
the Taxes which was necessary to support it, raised; That he delighted
not in Blood or Persecution; but that the Art of Government had different
Rules, according to the Climate and Nature of the People, where and upon whom
it was to be put in practice. His great <HI>Wisdom</HI> appeared in nothing
more, than in pre∣serving himself amidst his Troops, his Converts, his
Court and numerous Fa∣mily, all in a manner fit for the Throne. The greatness
of his Mind, and Magni∣ficence, in his Buildings. This was the Sum of the
Discourse these Gentlemen were pleased to entertain me with.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Pipi∣nerie.</HI></NOTE>At my return to
<HI>Paris</HI> I was to see the <HI>Pipinerie,</HI> or <HI>Royal Nursery of
Plants,</HI> in the <HI>Fauxbourgh</HI> of <HI>St. Honorie;</HI> where I met
the Master or Controuler of it, Mon∣sieur <HI>Morley,</HI> one of the
Ushers of the Bed-Chamber to the King.</P>
<P>He, like the rest of the <HI>French</HI> Nation, was Civil to
me; and shewed me a Writ∣ten Almanack of Flowring Plants for the whole year,
which he said was an Ori∣ginal; it might, indeed, be so in <HI>French,</HI>
but we have had Almanacks for Fruit and Flowers, for every month in the 
<PB N="215" REF="114"/>year, Printed divers times, for above this 30 years,
thanks to Mr. <HI>Evelyn.</HI></P>
<P>This Ground inclosed with high Walls is vastly big, as it
ought to be, to sup∣ply the Kings Gardens; Here are several Acres of young
Pines, Cypresses, Vues, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> also vast Beds of Stock
July-Flowers, of all sorts of Bulbes, as Tulips, Dafi∣dills, Crocus's,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and therefore I could easily believe him, when he told me,
he had sent from hence to <HI>Marli</HI> alone, in 4 years time, 18 millions
of Tulips, and other Bulbous Flowers; for which he offered to shew me his
Memoires.</P>
<P>He further told me, that the furnishing the <HI>Trianon,</HI> (a
peculiar House of Plea∣sure, with its Parterres at the end of the Gardens
at <HI>Versailles</HI>) with Flower Pots in season, every 14 days in the
Summer, took up no less than 92000 Pots from hence.</P>
<P>Also from hence he could Plant and furnish in 14 days time,
any new Gar∣den the King should cause to be made.</P>
<P>Here besides the Plants common to us and them, I saw a
multitude of Pots well conditioned of <HI>Staechas citrina folio
latius∣culo.</HI></P>
<P>Also a sort of <HI>Cotila,</HI> which bore large Sun Flowers
or Marigolds, propagated by Slips, called by him <HI>Amaroutre.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="115"/>In this Ground are several Houses to
lodge the tender Winter Greens; a∣mongst the rest there is one very large,
which I may call the <HI>Infirmery of sick Orange Trees;</HI> which coming
from <HI>Genoa</HI> by Sea, are here deposited in a pe∣culiar Green House;
and there were in it, and then actually carrying out into the Air, (it was the
22th of <HI>May</HI> our Style) 300 Trees in Cases as thick as a Man's Thigh;
but after 10, and some after 17 years cherishing, had not yet got Heads
decent enough to be removed, and to appear at Court, they being often forc't to
lop both Tops and Root, that they might recover them.</P>
<P>After all, it must be said, that this Magnificence, and the
number of these Palaces and Gardens, are the best and most commendable
effect of <HI>Arbitrary Go∣vernment.</HI> If these Expences were not in time
of Peace, what would be this Kings Riches, and the extream Poverty of the
People? For it is said, that every 3 years, some say much oftner, he has
all the Wealth of the Nation in his Coffers; so that there is a necessity
he should have as extravagant and incredible ways of expending it, that it
may have its due circulation amongst the People.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="115"/>But when this vast Wealth and Power is
turned to the Disturbance and Destru∣ction of Mankind, it is terrible; and
yet it hath its use too: We and all <HI>Europe</HI> have been taught, by the
Industry of this great King, mighty Improvements in War; so that
<HI>Europe</HI> has been these 12 years an Over-match for the <HI>Turk;</HI>
and we for <HI>France</HI> by the continuation of the War. The 40 Millions
<HI>Sterling</HI> which the late War hath, and will cost <HI>England,</HI>
before all is paid, was well be∣stowed, if it had been for no other end, than
to teach us the full use and practice of War; and in that Point to equal us
with our Neighbours.</P>
<P>It was observed by <HI>Polybius</HI> of the <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI>
that wherever they met with an Enemy, that had better Weapons than
themselves, they changed with them; This Docility gained them the Empire of
the World. On the contrary, those late Eastern Tyrants have despised
Learning, and consequently must submit to the more refined Valour of
<HI>Europe.</HI> I say, the Effects of Arbitrary Govern∣ment, both in War and
Peace, are Stu∣pendious.</P>
<P>The <HI>Roman Emperours,</HI> because abso∣lute Lords of the
People; far out-did the Commonwealth in Magnificent Build∣ings, 
<PB N="218" REF="116"/>both Publick and Private. <HI>Au∣gustus</HI> left
<HI>Rome</HI> a Marble City, which he found of Brick only. <HI>Nero</HI> burnt
it and rebuilt it, and a <HI>Golden Palace</HI> for himself, like a City.
<HI>Vespatian</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> built Amphitheaters and Baths far
surpassing any Buildings now upon the face of the Earth; in one of which
120000 Persons might see and hear, and be seated with more convenience,
than upon our Stages. <HI>Adrian</HI> visited most parts of the World, on
purpose to build Cities. <HI>Trajan</HI> had his Name on every Wall, which he
either restored, or built. His Pillar and Bridge over the <HI>Danube</HI> are
Stupendious Monu∣ments of his Expences.</P>
<P>The <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Kings built them Monu∣ments, wherein they
slaved their whole Nation, and which are the Wonders of the World to this
day, the <HI>Obelisks</HI> I mean, and <HI>Pyramids.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Asiatick Emperours</HI> of <HI>China</HI> and
<HI>Japan</HI> have outdone the <HI>Europeans</HI> in this kind of immense
Buildings, as the Wall in <HI>China,</HI> the Cut Rivers and Sluces and Bridges
there. In <HI>Japan</HI> the Buildings are no less incredibly great.</P>
<P>Of this Absolute Dominion we have Examples even in those two
<HI>American</HI> Empires, of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru.</HI> In this
last, meer Nature forc't Impossibilities <PB N="219" REF="116"/>without
Art, Tools, or Science. The <HI>Cusco</HI> Fortress was a Master-piece,
where Stones were laid upon Stones, which no Engine of ours could carry, or
raise up; or Tools better polish, and fit together; where a Country near as
big as all <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> was turned into a Garden, and cul∣tivated better
than <HI>Versailles,</HI> and Water-Works brought to Play and overspread
some thousands of miles, where it never Rains. This was the only Arbitrary
Go∣vernment well applied to the good of Mankind, I ever met with in History;
where Roads and Store-houses of Food and Raiment were the Guides, and
num∣bred the miles for the Travellers, and the whole Empire turned into an
useful and intelligible Map.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Turks, Persians,</HI> and <HI>Mogul,</HI> the
whole Empire is intended solely for the Pleasure of one Man; and here even
Tyranny it self is foully abused.</P>
<P>Yet I should be loth to see them in any kind exemplified in
<HI>England.</HI> In our happy Island we see such Palaces and Gardens, as
are for the Health and Ease of Man only; and what they want in Magnificence,
they have in Neatness. There is not such a thing as a <HI>Gravel Walk</HI>
in or about <HI>Paris,</HI> nor a <HI>Rowler</HI> of any sort; when it Rains
the Tuilleries <PB N="220" REF="117"/>are shut up, and one walks in Dirt
some days after. The Grass Plots, or, as they call them <HI>Bowling
Greens,</HI> are as ill kept, they clip them and beat them with flat Beaters as
they do their Walks. This puts me in mind of what I saw in the Garden of the
<HI>Prince of Conde</HI> in <HI>Paris;</HI> where there was a Grassy Circle
of about 4 foot wide, round one of the Fountains in the middle of the Garden;
to keep this down, and make it of a finer Turf, the Gardner had Teathered two
<HI>Black Lambs,</HI> and two <HI>White Kids,</HI> at equal distances, which
fed upon it. What ever the effect was, I thought it lookt pretty enough; and
the little <HI>Animals</HI> were as Ornamen∣tal, as the Grass.</P>
<P>All the Paintings and Prints made of late years of the King make
him look very old; which in my mind is not so; for he is plump in the Face,
and is well coloured, and seems healthy, and eats and drinks heartily, which
I saw him do; This is certainly an injury to him, and possibly in
complaisance to the Dauphin, or worse. This is the meanest Compliment I
have known the French guilty of to∣wards their Prince; for there are every

<PB N="221" REF="117"/>The <HI>Romans</HI> under <HI>Augustus,</HI> (the
first Ab∣solute Master of that People, as this King is of the
<HI>French</HI>) had upon this Subject from the People a much finer thought,
and wish, <HI>De nostris annis tibi Jupiter au∣geat annos.</HI></P>
<P>However it be, the King seems not to like <HI>Versailles</HI>
so well as he did; and has an Opinion, that the Air is not so good, as
elsewhere; he leaves it (as I said) every week on <HI>Tuesday</HI> night,
and goes mostly to <HI>Marli,</HI> or <HI>Meudon,</HI> and some∣times to
the <HI>Trianon,</HI> which is but at the end of the Gardens, and returns not
to <HI>Versailles</HI> till <HI>Saturday</HI> night: Besides his
extraordinary removes to <HI>Fontainbleau.</HI> I wonder no body puts him in
mind of that Paradise of <HI>France, Languedoc,</HI> where he may be with
ease in 4 days, at the Rate that Kings use to Travel. I had this
Discourse at Table with one of the In∣troducteurs to the Ambassadour at
<HI>Ver∣sailles;</HI> but he could not bear it, it being against the
Interest of all settled Courts to remove, though it were never so good
for their Princes Health. I remember but of one Instance in History, and
that was <HI>Aurenzebe</HI> the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> who in his middle Age
fell desperately sick, and long languisht at <HI>Labor;</HI> but took
Advice of some body about him, and went in <PB N="222" REF="118"/>his own
Kingdom a progress of 1000 miles to <HI>Casimire,</HI> a very mild and
tem∣perate Climate, where he recovered, and lived to almost a 100 years
old.</P>
<P>The King now seldom or never Plays, but contents himself
sometimes with look∣ing on; but he hath formerly been en∣gaged, and has
lost great Sums. Mon∣sieur <HI>S.</HI> Rookt him of near a Million of
Livers at Basset, by putting false Cards upon him; but was imprisoned
and ba∣nisht for it some years.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subsection">
<P>Before I give over the Business of Gar∣dens and Countrey, I
will add some Re∣marks, which seemed particular and new to me.</P>
<P>In the Kitchin Gardens at and near <HI>Paris,</HI> are a great
number of <HI>Apricock Standards;</HI> but kept low; very full of Blossoms,
and good Bearers.</P>
<P>They make a Conserve of the Fruit; which I like above any of
their Wet Sweetmeats; it was made by cutting them into thin slices, and
throwing a∣way the Stone; which our People spare sometimes, and leave in
the Flesh intire, and spoils the Sweetmeat, and sets it a fretting.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="118"/>They imploy the Stones in Brandy, and
distil them in Spirits.</P>
<P>In the beginning of <HI>April</HI> we had store of Sparagrass,
but they were often so bitter, to me at least, that there was little
pleasure in eating them. 'Tis certain they were much worse, than ours in
<HI>England</HI> in that particular. Which puts me in mind of the <HI>Wild
Sparagrass,</HI> which grows plentifully with us on the <HI>Sea Coast</HI>
in <HI>Lincolnshire.</HI> This is very fair to the Eye; yet no culture of our
Gardens, by often transplanting, could make it eat∣able. I fancy the
Sparagrass recovers some∣thing of its natural force in a warmer Cli∣mate;
for the sweet is as it were degene∣rated. If they would have them good here,
they must renew the Seed from <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>The Wild Sparagrass of <HI>Languedoc</HI> is another Plant
called <HI>Corruda.</HI></P>
<P>I procured out of <HI>Languedoc</HI> a sort of <HI>Praecox
Vine,</HI> about 50 Plants, by the <HI>Clermont</HI> Carrier; the which I gave
to Mr. <HI>London,</HI> our Kings Gardner, for my Lord Ambassador. This
Grape is White, very thin Skinn'd, and clear as a drop of Water; it is
usually ripe at <HI>St. Johns∣mass</HI> in <HI>July</HI> at
<HI>Montpellier,</HI> where it is called <HI>Des Ʋnies.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="119"/>There are also in this Town <HI>Praecox
Grapes,</HI> as Dr. <HI>Turnfort</HI> told me, in the Physick Garden; but
whether the same with the <HI>Ʋnies,</HI> I know not.</P>
<P>I have said they delight much in Figs in Pots or Cases; but
here is another way of preserving the Fig Trees set in the Ground, which is
much practised; and that is to lap, and tie them up in long Straw, from top
to bottom; for which they are placed at a little distance from the Walls.
This also is practised to such Trees as stand in the middle of the
Par∣terre; they did not open them till Mid-<HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>The Exotic Trees, which the <HI>Parisians</HI> most delight
in, for their Garden Walks, and for the Shade in their Courts, are the
<HI>Maroniers, or Horse Chesnuts,</HI> of which they have innumerable; for
the Fruit ripens very well here, and comes up of it self. Also the
<HI>Acacia Rovini,</HI> which is very common, and makes pretty Alleys, and
which they <HI>lop and turn to Pollards, with good effect;</HI> but of these
last the Leaves are late in putting forth, it being the 15th of <HI>May</HI>
our Syle, when these Trees were scarce green.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 25, when I took my Leave of Monsieur
<HI>Valliant,</HI> I found him in his Flower Garden; he shewed me a Parcel 
<PB N="225" REF="119"/>of <HI>Ranunculus</HI>'s, in full Flower, which he had
received but two years before from <HI>Constantinople;</HI> They were very
beautiful and rare, at least such as I had never seen; as pure White,
White and Green, White and Strip't with Carnation, Pure Carnation or
Rose-colour, Strip't Carna∣tion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Of these he had sold some a Pistol a Root, and hoped in a
year or two to be more plentifully stock't with them, that he might afford
them cheaper. I did see afterwards a few of them in the Royal
<HI>Pipinerie,</HI> and also in the Seedsman's Gar∣den, Monsieur <HI>le
Febre;</HI> but both came from him.</P>
<P>I also took notice of his Iron Cradles or Hoops over his Beds,
which were re∣movable, and to be made higher and lower, according to the height
and na∣ture of the Floors they were designed to cover. This, me-thoughts, was
far be∣yond all the Inventions of Wooden Co∣vers, and might with Sail-Cloths
and Mats well serve for a sort of portable Green House, to the less
tender Plants.</P>
<P>I saw <HI>Le Febre</HI>'s Flower Garden <HI>May</HI> 9. The
Tulips were in their prime; indeed, he had a very large and plentiful
Col∣lection. The Panacheé or Strip't Tulips were many, and of great
variety. He <PB N="226" REF="120"/>observed to me, that from his large and
numerous Beds of <HI>self-flower'd</HI> Tulips, that is, of one colour, as
Red, Yellow, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they expected yearly some Stript ones, which
<HI>if perfect,</HI> that is, strip't in all the six Leaves, would but
doubtfully continue, and perhaps return to their former state the next year;
but if they <HI>laboured,</HI> or did not finish the stripings of all the
six Leaves the first year, there were better hopes of their continuing in
that state.</P>
<P>Though I had no mind to descend into the <HI>Stone Pits,</HI>
which are like our Mines, Well-fashion, and the Stones wound up with great
Wheels, to husband the Soil over them: Yet I went to <HI>Vanre,</HI> 3 miles
from the Town, which is a ridge of Hills that runs along to the
<HI>Observatoire.</HI> Here the Quarries are open on the side of the Hill,
as with us. In those I observed 2 or 3 layers of Stone, 2 or 3 foot thick,
mostly made up of Shells, or <HI>Stones in the fashion of Shells.</HI>
Amongst these Shell-stones the most remarkable for bigness was a
certain smooth and long <HI>Buccinum,</HI> tapering with very many spires.
I measured one whose first spire was 8 inches diameter, the full length
I could not so well come at; yet holding proportion with those of the kind
which lay flat, and which we could see in their full length, it must have
been <PB N="227" REF="120"/>a foot long at least. There is no
<HI>Bucci∣num</HI> in any of our Seas a quarter so big. Here are many of this
Species. Also other large Turbinated Stones, which come near some of the
<HI>West-India</HI> Kinds of <HI>Mu∣sic Shells,</HI> of which
<HI>Genus</HI> yet there are none in the <HI>European</HI> Seas.</P>
<P>These Layers of Stone mixt with Shell-figured bodies, are at
certain distances in the Rock, and other Rocks void of Shells
interposed.</P>
<P>Fanciful Men may think what they please of this matter; sure I
am, until the History of Nature, and more parti∣cularly that of Minerals and
Fossils is better lookt into, and more accurately distinguisht, all
Reasoning is in vain. It is to be observed, where Men are most in the
dark, there Impudence reigns most, as upon this Subject: They are not
con∣tent fairly to dissent, but to insult every body else. In like
manner upon the Sub∣ject of Mineral Waters; How many <HI>Scriblers</HI> have
there been, without any knowledge of Fossils?</P>
<P>I know not whether it be worth the not∣ing, but it shews the
Humour of the <HI>French,</HI> that I saw in some Country Towns near
<HI>Paris,</HI> the Church Wall near the top, had a two foot broad Mourning
List, which compassed the whole Church like a <PB N="228" REF="121"/>Girdle, and on this was at certain di∣stances, painted the Arms of
the Lord of the Mannor, who was dead.</P>
</DIV2>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="section">
<P>I shall conclude, what I have to say further, with the Air of
<HI>Paris,</HI> and the State of Health and Physic there.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Air.</NOTE>The <HI>Air</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> is
drier than that of <HI>England,</HI> notwithstanding the greatest part of
the City is placed in a dirty miry Level; The Muddy Banks of the River
<HI>Seine</HI> witness this; also the old <HI>Latin</HI> Name of <HI>Paris,
Lutetia;</HI> but some of them are unwilling to derive it from
<HI>Lu∣tum;</HI> though there are several other Towns in <HI>France,</HI>
formerly more consi∣derable than it, of that very Name; but from the
<HI>Greek</HI> Original, as <HI>Tolon, Tolousa,</HI> which in that Language
signifie <HI>Black Dirt.</HI> We have an undoubted Experi∣ment of the
different Temper of the Air in our <HI>Philosophic Transactions;</HI> where
it is demonstrated, that there falls twice as much Rain in <HI>England,</HI>
as at <HI>Paris;</HI> Re∣gisters of both having carefully been kept, for so
many years, both here and in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>From this quantity of Rain with us, our Fields are much greener; and
it was a pleasing surprise to me at my return, sailing up the River of
<HI>Thames,</HI> to see our <PB N="229" REF="121"/>green Fields and Pastures
on every side; but we pay dearly for it, in Agues and Coughs, and Rheumatick
Distempers.</P>
<P>The Winter was very rude and fierce, as was ever known in the Memory
of Man; The cold Winds very piercing; and the Common People walk the Streets
all in Mouffes, and Multitudes had little <HI>Brass Kettles</HI> of Smallcoal
kindled, hang∣ing on their Arms; and yet you should scarce hear any one
Cough.</P>
<P>I never saw a Mist at <HI>Paris</HI> in the 6 months I staid
there, but one; though a very broad River runs through the middle of the City,
nor any very strong Winds; but this may be accidental, and the Tem∣per of
some one year by chance.</P>
<P>We were very sensible by the 20th of <HI>February</HI> our
Style, though the Nights were cold, and the White Frosts great in the
Mornings, that the Sun at Noon had a much stronger force and heat, than with
us, at that time of the year.</P>
<P>Another Argument, of the Dryness of the Air at <HI>Paris,</HI> we
had from the alterati∣on of Health; such as were thick Breath∣ed, and Cought
and Spit much, soon re∣covered; and the insensible perspiration of the
Skin was so clear and free, that the Kidneys had little to do; so that it
was observed by most, that though we <PB N="230" REF="122"/>drank pretty
freely of the thin Wines of <HI>Champagne</HI> and <HI>Burgundy,</HI> yet they
never broke our sleep to get shut of them; and that very little passed
that way in the morning.</P>
<P>Lastly, a sign of the Driness and great goodness of the Air
of <HI>Paris</HI> is, the vast number of Iron Bars all over the City; which
yet are mostly intire, and the least decayed with Rust, I ever saw in
any place; whereas ours in <HI>London</HI> are all in a few years all over
rusty, and miserably eaten.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Water.</NOTE>We were sufficiently alarmed at
our first coming to <HI>Paris,</HI> with the unwhole∣someness of the
<HI>River Water,</HI> and cautioned against drinking it; and yet it was
al∣most impossible to avoid the bad effects of it, for within the month
two thirds of the Family fell into Fluxes, some into Dysenteries, and
some very ill of it. The <HI>French</HI> that come out of other re∣mote
Countreys suffer as well as the Stran∣gers. We were told boiling it was a
good Remedy to prevent its Griping Qua∣lity; but that is a meer Notion, for we
know Mineral Waters boiled have a stronger effect, and this quality can
pro∣ceed from nothing less.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="122"/>The <HI>Well Waters</HI> here are much worse
than the River Waters, because more Mineral. But our safety was in the
Water brought from the <HI>Maison des Eaux,</HI> where the Aqueduct of
<HI>Arcueil</HI> empties it self to serve the great Palaces and City
Fountains.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dysentery.</NOTE>The Disease of the
<HI>Dysentery</HI> being one of the most common in <HI>Paris,</HI> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hypopecou∣ana.</HI></NOTE>the most
celebrated Drug for its cure is now the <HI>Hypopecouana;</HI> though I never
once made use of it to any of our People, but cured them all as soon, and
as well with our usual Remedies. Indeed they have great need of it here, for
the poorer sort of People, through ill Diet, this Wa∣ter, and Herbs, are very
subject to it; This Root is said to cure it with as much certainty, and as
readily, as the Jesuits Powder an Ague; Of this most of the Physicians
and Apothecaries agreed. They give it in Powder from 10 grains to 40, which is
the largest Dose. It most commonly Vomits, and sometimes Purges, but
both gently. 'Tis sold here from 20 to 50 Crowns a Pound. They divide it into
4 sorts, according to its goodness.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="123"/> 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Stone.</NOTE>Another popular Disease here
is the <HI>Stone;</HI> and there are Men well practised in the Cutting for
it. There are also two Hospitals, where great numbers are cut yearly, as
<HI>La Charite,</HI> and <HI>Hostel-Dieu,</HI> in both of these there are
Wired Chests full of Stones cut from Human Bodies; and in the Chest of
<HI>La Charite</HI> is one, which exceeds all belief; it was cut from a Monk,
who died in the very Operation; it is as big as a Childs Head. It is but the
Mo∣del or Patern of the Stone which is kept in the Chest; which has this
Inscription on it. 
<Q><HI>Figure &amp; grosseur de la pierre, pesant</HI> 51
<HI>ounces, qui font trois livres trois ounces, qui a esté
tirée dans cet Hospital au mois de Juin</HI> 1690, <HI>&amp; que l'ou
conserve dans le couvent de la Charité.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But that which I shall here most insist upon is the <HI>new
way,</HI> practised by <HI>Pere Jaques,</HI> a Monk. About the 20th of
<HI>April</HI> he cut in the <HI>Hostel-Dieu</HI> 10 in less than an hours
time: The 3d day after, all were hearty and without pain but one.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="123"/>He cuts both by the grand and little Appareil;
in both he boldly thrusts in a broad Lancet or Stilleto into the middle of
the Muscle of the Thigh near the <HI>Anus,</HI> till he joins the Catheter or
Staff, or the Stone betwixt his Fingers; then he wi∣dens the incision of the
Blader in pro∣portion to the Stone with a Silver <HI>Oval Hoop;</HI> if that
will not do, he thrusts in his 4 Fingers, and tears it wider; then with the
<HI>Ducks Bill</HI> he draws it out.</P>
<P>I see him cut a second time in the <HI>Ho∣stel-Dieu;</HI> and
he performed it upon 9 Persons in 3 quarters of an hour, very dexterously.
He seemed to venture at all; and put me into some disorder with the
cruelty of the Operation; and a stouter <HI>Englishman</HI> than my self.
How∣ever I visited them all in their Beds, and found them more amazed, than
in pain.</P>
<P><HI>Pere Jaques</HI> cut also his way in the other Hospital
<HI>La Charite,</HI> much about the same time, 11 at twice. Here Monsieur
<HI>Mar∣shal,</HI> the best of the Surgeons for this Operation now in
<HI>Paris,</HI> harangu'd against him before the Governors, who coldly
answered, they would be determined by the Event, which way was best.</P>
<Q><PB N="234" REF="124"/><HI>Atque hac ratione Faeminis Calcúli
omnium facillimè exciduntur; nempe scalpello intra va∣ginam uteri in
vesicam adacto.</HI></Q>
<P>Of those cut in <HI>La Charite</HI> one died; and being
dissected, it was found he had his Bladder pierced in 4 or 5 places; also
the <HI>Museulus Psous</HI> sadly mangled; also the left
<HI>Vesiculae Seminales</HI> cut.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this, if this Method was well executed by a
Skilful Hand, it might be of good use to Mankind.</P>
<P>This way of Cutting for the Stone, puts me in mind of what I
formerly writ and publisht in the <HI>Phil. Transactions,</HI> about
Cutting above the <HI>Os Pubis,</HI> in the Fund of the Bladder.</P>
<P>Also of that Experiment of Cutting for the Stone of an Alderman of
<HI>Don∣caster</HI> in the <HI>Gluteus Major,</HI> he was twice cut in the
same place, and out-lived both. I saw the first Stone, which was very
large, and in some measure transparent, Crystal like. This Experiment
is Printed in Dr. <HI>Willies Scarborough Spaw,</HI> 14 years ago at least,
and is a fair hint for this new Method.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="124"/>Since my return I had a Letter from Mr.
<HI>Probie,</HI> a very Learned and Industri∣ous young Gentleman, who was
with me to see the Operation, that part relating to this Matter I shall
here transcribe. Indeed, I mightily longed for an Account of this Matter, the
success of which I came away too soon to learn any thing for certain.</P>
<P><LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE>Paris, 
<DATE>Aug. 2. 98.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P><HI>PEre Jaque</HI>'s Reputation mightily slackens, out of
Forty five that he cut at the <HI>Ho∣stel-Dieu,</HI> but sixteen of them
survive; and of Nineteen in the <HI>Charite,</HI> but eleven. He has
practised at the Hospitals at <HI>Lyons,</HI> but, 'tis said, with
worse success than at <HI>Paris.</HI> I am sensible he has got
abundance of Ene∣mies, which makes me very often question, what I may hear
said of him. Dr. <HI>Fagon,</HI> the Kings Physician, told Dr.
<HI>Turnfort,</HI> when he went to present his Book to him, that he had cut
Seven at <HI>Versailles,</HI> and that six of them are alive, and as well
as if never cut. The Person that died was so Distem∣pered, that he was
not expected to live, and 'twas thought, if he had not been cut, he had not
lived so long: The Surgeons have a great mind to cry down the Man, though
they <PB N="236" REF="125"/>practise his Method. For <HI>Marshal</HI> has
since cut after <HI>Pere Jaque</HI>'s Manner, only with this difference, that
<HI>Marshal</HI>'s <HI>Catheter</HI> was can∣nulated. <HI>Le Rue,</HI> the
second Surgeon of the <HI>Charity Hospital</HI> cut after the old Manner,
at the same time when <HI>Marshal</HI> cut <HI>Pere Jaque</HI>'s way, but
had not so good success as <HI>Marshal</HI> had; for all that
<HI>Marshal</HI> cut are alive and very well, whereas the other lost one or
two of his number; besides, those that lived were not so soon cur'd,
no, not by a month or six weeks.</P>
</LETTER>Thus far Mr. <HI>Probie.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pox.</NOTE>The <HI>Pox</HI> here is the great
Business of the Town; a Disease which in some mea∣sure hath
contributed to the ruine of Physick here, as in <HI>London.</HI> This Secret
Service hath introduced little Contempti∣ble Animals of all sorts into
Business, and hath given them occasion to insult Fa∣milies, after they
had once the know∣ledge of these Misfortunes. And it is for this reason the
Quacks here, as with us, do thrive vastly into great Riches beyond any of the
Physicians, by treating pri∣vately these Calamities.</P>
<P>It was a pleasant Diversion to me to read upon the Walls every
where about the Town, but more particularly in the <HI>Fauxbourgh</HI> of
<HI>St. Germain,</HI> the Quacks Bills Printed in great Uncial Letters.</P>

<P><PB N="238" REF="126"/> By these Bills it is evident, there is yet
a certain Modesty and Decorum left in the Concealing this Disease, even
a∣mongst the <HI>French;</HI> They would be Cured secretly, and as though
nothing were doing; which those Wretches high∣ly promise. But this is that
Handle which gives those mean People an occa∣sion to insult their
Reputation, and injure them in their Health for ever.</P>
<P>Every body here puts their helping Hand, and meddles with the Cure
of this Disease, as Apothecaries, Barbers, Women, and Monks; yet I did not
find by all the inquiry I could make, that they had other Remedies than we.
Nay, there is something practised in the Cure of this Distemper in
<HI>England,</HI> which they at <HI>Paris</HI> know nothing of; but this old
Verse forbids me to say any thing further. 
<Q> 
<L><HI>Artem pudere proloqui, quam factites.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Apotheca∣ries Shops.</NOTE>The <HI>Apothecaries
Shops</HI> are neat enough, if they were but as well stored with Me∣dicines;
and some are very finely adorn∣ed, and have an Air of greatness, as that of
Monsieur <HI>Geofferie,</HI> who has been <HI>Provost des Merchands,</HI>
in the <HI>Rue Burte∣bur,</HI> where the Entry to the <HI>Basse Cour</HI>
is a <HI>Port-cochier,</HI> with Vasa's of Copper in the Niches of the
Windows; within are <PB N="239" REF="126"/>Rooms adorned with huge Vasa's and
Mortors of Brass, as well for sight, as for use. The Drugs and
Compositions are kept in Cabinets disposed round the Room. Also
Laboratories backwards in great perfection and neatness. I must needs
commend this Gentleman for his Civility towards me; and for his Care in
Educating his Son, who came over with Count <HI>Tallard,</HI> a most Hopeful
and Learned Young Man; whom our Society at <HI>Gresham-Colledge,</HI> at my
Request, ho∣noured with admitting him Fellow, ac∣cording to his
Deserts.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Physicians.</NOTE>I had the opportunity of
Conversing with many of the Physicians in this Ci∣ty; who all agree in the
low Condition and Disesteem it was in, from the bound∣less Confidence and
intruding of Quacks, Women, and Monks. Monsieur <HI>d'Achin,</HI> the late
chief Physician, has been ill thought on for taking Money, and gi∣ving
protection to these sort of Cattle; but the chief Physician now,
Monsieur <HI>Fagon,</HI> is a Man of great Honour and Learning, and very
desirous to promote the Art.</P>
<P>It is here as with us, some practise out of meer vanity, others
to make a Penny any way to get Bread. The cause of all <PB N="240" REF="127"/>this is, I think, the great Confidence People have of their own
Skill, an ar∣rogance without thinking. To pass a Judgment upon Cures, and the
good and evil practice of Physick, without doubt is one of the nicest
things, even to Men of the Faculty; but a Jury, that is, the very ordinary Men
in <HI>England,</HI> are suffered now to undertake the Question; when I may
truly say, that I have ever found, no disparagement to them, the most
Learned Men of the Nation, the most mistaken in these Matters; and can it
be otherwise in so Conjectural an Art, when we our selves scarce know,
when we have done ill or well.</P>
<P>Another cause of the low Esteem of Physick here, are the
sorry Fees that are given to Physicians; which makes that Science not worth
the Application and Study. The King indeed is very liberal, as in all things
else, in his Pensions to his chief Physician, and gives his Chil∣dren
good Preferments.</P>
<P>Also Mr. <HI>Burdelot,</HI> who is also well Pensioned, and
lodged at <HI>Versailles,</HI> Phy∣sician to the Dutchess of
<HI>Burgundy,</HI> a Learned Man; he is perfectly well Skill'd in the History
of Physick; and we may shortly (as he told me) expect from him, another
Supplement to <HI>Vauder Linden,</HI> of <PB N="241" REF="127"/>many thousand
Volumes, which have escaped that Catalogue, and are not ac∣counted for.</P>
<P>Monsieur, and the Dauphin, and all the Princes of the Blood, have
their Do∣mestick Physicians; some of whom I knew, as Monsieur
<HI>Arlot,</HI> Monsieur <HI>Mi∣not,</HI> to the Prince of <HI>Conty,</HI> of
my ac∣quaintance formerly at <HI>Montpelier.</HI> The Two <HI>Morins</HI> very
Learned Men; also Monsieur <HI>Grimodel, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Others have the practice of Nunneries and Convents, which gives them
Bread; others have Parishes; and some such Shifts they make; but all is
wrong with them, and very little incouragement given to the Faculty.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 14. the <HI>Prince of Conty</HI> sent his Gentleman
and Coach at mid-night to fetch me to his Son, and to bring with me the late
King <HI>Charles's Drops</HI> to give him. This was a very hasty call. I told
the Messenger, I was the Prince's very humble Servant; but for any Drops or
other Medicines I had brought nothing at all with me, and had used only
such as I found in their Shops, for all the oc∣casions I had had to use
any. I desired he would tell him, that I was ready to Consult with his
Physicians upon his Sons Sickness, if he pleased to command me, 
<PB N="242" REF="128"/>but for coming upon any other Account I desired to be
excused; but I heard no more of the Matter, and the young Prince died. By
this it is evident, there is as false a Notion of Physick in this Coun∣try,
as with us; and that it is here also thought a Knack, more than a Science or
Method; and little Chimical Toys, the Bijous of Quacks, are mightily in
request. This Heresie hath possessed the most think∣ing, as well
as the ignorant part of Man∣kind; and for this we are beholden to the late vain
Expositors of Nature, who have mightily inveighed against and un∣dervalued
the ancient <HI>Greek</HI> Physicians, in whose Works only this Art is to
be learnt, unless single Persons could live over as many Ages, as those
Wise Men did.</P>
<P>Men are apt to prescribe to their Phy∣sician, before he can
possibly tell, what he shall in his Judgment think fitting to give; 'tis
well if this was in Negatives only; but they are prejudiced by the impertinence
of the Age, and <HI>our Men,</HI> who ought to Converse with the Patient and
his Relations with Prognosticks only, which are the honour of Physick, and
not play the Philosopher by fanciful and pre∣carious Interpretations of the
Nature of Diseases and Medicines, to gain a sort of <PB N="243" REF="128"/>Credit with the Ignorant; and such cer∣tainly are all those that
have not studied Physick thoroughly, and in earnest.</P>
<P>Those Drops were desired of me by other Persons of Quality, as
the Princess <HI>d'Espinoy,</HI> the Duchess of <HI>Boullon,</HI>
Mon∣sieur <HI>Sesac, &amp;c.</HI> and having bethought my self how my
Master, the late King <HI>Charles,</HI> had communicated them to me, and
shewed me very obligingly the Pro∣cess himself, by carrying me alone with
him into his Elaboratory at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> while it was Distilling.
Also Mr. <HI>Che∣vins</HI> another time shewed me the Mate∣rials for the
Drops in his Appartment newly brought in, in great quantity, that is, <HI>Raw
Silk.</HI> I caused the Drops to be made here. Also I put Dr.
<HI>Turnfort</HI> upon making of them; which he did in perfection, by
Distilling the finest Raw Silk he could get. For my part I was
sur∣prised at the Experiment often repeated, having never tried it before.
One Pound of Raw Silk yielded an incredible quanti∣ty of Volatil Salt, and in
proportion the finest Spirit I ever tasted; and that which recommends it
is, that it is when rectified, of a far more pleasant smell, than that
which comes from Sal Armoniack or Hartshorne; and the Salt refined and
cohobated with any well scented Chimical Oil, makes the <PB N="244" REF="129"/><HI>Kings Salt,</HI> as its us'd to be called. This my Lord
Ambassador gave me leave to present in his Name; and the Doctor now
supplies those which want. Silk, indeed is nothing else, but a dry Jelly
from the Insect Kind, and therefore very Cordial and Stomachick no doubt. The
<HI>Arabians</HI> were wise, and knowing in the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> to
have put it in their <HI>Alkermes.</HI></P>
<P>This must be said for the Honour of this King, that he has ever
given great Encouragements for useful Discoveries in all Kinds, and
particularly in Physick. 'Tis well known he bought the Secret of the
Jesuits Powder, and made it pub∣lick; as he lately did that of the
<HI>Hypo∣cocana.</HI></P>
<P>To Conclude, it was my good Fortune here to have a Bundle of
Original Pa∣pers of Sir <HI>Theodore Mayerne,</HI> and his Friends, who
Corresponded with him, presented me by the Reverend Dr. <HI>Wickar,</HI>
Dean of <HI>Winchester,</HI> who Marrying his Kinswoman found them
amongst other Writings of Law Matters. I have not yet had the leisure to
peruse them, but those who know the Worth of that great Man, will desire
they may be made pub∣lick; which if they are, they shall come <PB REF="132"/> 
<PB N="245" REF="132"/>forth intire, and not disguised, as some of his
other Papers have been, to the great detriment of Physick; and I think it is
the first Example of this Nature, that Posthumous Papers were ever
abre∣viated, and made what they never were, before an intire and full
publication.</P>
