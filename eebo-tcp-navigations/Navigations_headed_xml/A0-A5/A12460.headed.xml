If the indeauours of those vermin be acceptable,

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF
New-England, by Captaine
Iohn Smith.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the moneth of Aprill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">My first voy∣age to new-England.</NOTE> 1614.
with two Ships from <HI>London,</HI> of
a few Marchants, I chanced to ar∣riue
in <HI>New-England,</HI> a parte of
<HI>Ameryca,</HI> at the Ile of <HI>Monahig∣gan,</HI>
in 43 of Northerly lati∣tude:
our plot was there to take Whales and make
tryalls of a Myne of Gold and Copper. If those fai∣led,
Fish and Furres was then our refuge, to make
our selues sauers howsoeuer: we found this Whale∣fishing
a costly conclusion: we saw many, and spent
much time in chasing them; but could not kill any:
They beeing a kinde of Iubartes, and not the
Whale that yeeldes Finnes and Oyle as wee expec∣ted.
For our Golde, it was rather the Masters de∣uice
to get a voyage that proiected it, then any
knowledge hee had at all of any such matter. Fish
&amp; Furres was now our guard: &amp; by our late arriual,
and long lingring about the Whale, the prime of
both those seasons were past ere wee perceiued it;
we thinking that their seasons serued at all times:
<PB N="2" REF="10"/>
but wee found it otherwise; for, by the midst
of Iune, the fishing failed. Yet in Iuly and August
some was taken, but not sufficient to defray so great
a charge as our stay required. Of dry fish we made
about 40000. of Cor fish about 7000. Whilest
the sailers fished, my selfe with eight or nine others
of them might best bee spared; Ranging the coast
in a small boat, wee got for trifles neer 1100 Beuer
skinnes, 100 Martins, and neer as many Otters;
and the most of them within the distance of twenty
leagues. We ranged the Coast both East and West
much furder; but Eastwards our commodities were
not esteemed, they were so neare the French who af∣fords
them better: and right against vs in the Main
was a Ship of Sir <HI>Frances Popphames,</HI> that had there
such acquaintance, hauing many yeares vsed onely
that porte, that the most parte there was had by
him. And 40 leagues westwards were two French
Ships, that had made there a great voyage by trade,
during the time wee tryed those conclusions, not
knowing the Coast, nor Saluages habitation. With
these Furres, the Traine, and Cor-fish I returned
for <HI>England</HI> in the Bark: where within six monthes
after our departure from the <HI>Downes,</HI> we safe arriued
back. The best of this fish was solde for fiue pound
the hundreth, the rest by ill vsage betwixt three
pound and fifty shillings. The other Ship staied to

For from the degrees of 30. to 45. his Maiestie

<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
miles; but to follow it aboard, the shore may well
be 2000. at the least: of which, 20. miles is the
most giues entrance into the Bay of <HI>Chisapeak,</HI>
where is the <HI>London</HI> plantation: within which is
a Country (as you may perceiue by the description
in a Booke and Map printed in my name of that
little I there discouered) may well suffice 300000
people to inhabit. And Southward adioyneth
that part discouered at the charge of Sir <HI>Walter

M<SUP>r</SUP>. <HI>Thomas Heryot.</HI> Northward six or
seauen degrees is the Riuer <HI>Sadagahock,</HI> where was

may be bettered by the fruits of their la∣bours.
But for diuers others that long before and
since haue ranged those parts, within a kenning
sometimes of the shore, some touching in one
place some in another, I must entreat them pardon
me for omitting them; or if I offend in saying
that their true descriptions are concealed, or neuer
well obserued, or died with the Authors: so that
the Coast is yet still but euen as a Coast vnknowne
and vndiscouered. I haue had six or seauen seuerall
plots of those Northren parts, so vnlike each to
other, and most sodiffering from any true propor∣tion,
or resemblance of the Countrey, as they did
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
mee no more good, then so much waste paper,
though they cost me more. It may be it was not
my chance to see the best; but least others may be
deceiued as I was, or through dangerous ignorance
hazard themselues as I did, I haue drawen a
Map from Point to Point, Ile to Ile, and Harbour
to Harbour, with the Soundings, Sands, Rocks, &amp;
Land-marks as I passed close aboard the Shore in a
little Boat; although there bemany things to bee
obserued which the haste of other affaires did cause
me omit: for, being sent more to get present com∣modities,
then knowledge by discoueries for any
future good, I had not power to search as I would:
yet it will serue to direct any shall goe that waies,
to safe Harbours and the Saluages habitations:
What marchandize and commodities for their la∣bour
they may finde, this following discourse shall
plainely demonstrate.</P>
<P>Thus you may see, of this 2000. miles more
then halfe is yet vnknowne to any purpose: no not
so much as the borders of the Sea are yet certainly
discouered. As for the goodnes and true substan∣ces
of the Land, wee are for most part yet altoge∣ther
ignorant of them, vnlesse it bee those parts a∣bout
the Bay of <HI>Chisapeack</HI> and <HI>Sagadahock:</HI> but
onely here and there wee touched or haue seene a
little the edges of those large dominions, which
doe stretch themselues into the Maine, God doth
know how many thousand miles; whereof we can
yet no more iudge, then a stranger that saileth be∣twixt
<HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> can describe the Harbors
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
and dangers by landing here or there in some Ri∣uer
or Bay, tell thereby the goodnesse and substan∣ces
of <HI>Spaine, Italy, Germany, Bohemia, Hungaria</HI> &amp;
the rest. By this you may perceiue how much they
erre, that think euery one w<SUP>ch</SUP> hath bin at <HI>Virginia</HI>
vnderstandeth or knowes what <HI>Virginia</HI> is: Or that
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> know one halfe quarter of those Ter∣ritories
they possesse; no, not so much as the true
circumference of <HI>Terra Incognita,</HI> whose large do∣minions
may equalize the greatnesse and goodnes
of <HI>America,</HI> for any thing yet known. It is strange
with what small power hee hath raigned in the
<HI>East Indes;</HI> and few will vnderstand the truth of
his strength in <HI>America:</HI> where he hauing so much
to keepe with such a pampered force, they neede
not greatly feare his furie, in the <HI>Bermudas,
Virginia, New France,</HI> or <HI>New England;</HI> beyond
whose bounds <HI>America</HI> doth stretch many
thousand miles: into the frozen partes whereof
one Master <HI>Hutson</HI> an English Mariner did make
the greatest discouerie of any Christian I knowe
of, where he vnfortunately died. For <HI>Affrica,</HI> had
not the industrious Portugales ranged her vn∣knowne
parts, who would haue sought for wealth
among those fryed Regions of blacke brutish Ne∣gers,
where not withstanding all the wealth and ad∣mirable
aduentures &amp; endeauours more then 140
yeares, they knowe not one third of those blacke
habitations. But it is not a worke for euery one, to
manage such an affaire as makes a discouerie, and
plants a Colony: It requires all the best parts of
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>
Art, Iudgement, Courage, Honesty, Cōstancy, Di∣ligence
and Industrie, to doe but neere well. Some
are more proper for one thing then another; and
therein are to be imployed: and nothing breedes
more confusion then misplacing and misimploy∣ing
men in their vndertakings. <HI>Columbus, Cortez,
Pitzara, Soto, Magellanes,</HI> and the rest serued more
then a prentiship to learne how to begin their most
memorable attempts in the <HI>West Indes:</HI> which to
the wonder of all ages succesfully they effected,
when many hundreds of others farre aboue them
in the worlds opinion, beeing instructed but by re∣lation,
came to shame and confusion in actions of
small moment, who doubtlesse in other matters,
were both wise, discreet, generous, and couragi∣ous.
I say not this to detract any thing from their
incomparable merits, but to answer those questi∣onlesse
questions that keep vs back from imitating
the worthinesse of their braue spirits that aduan∣ced
themselues from poore Souldiers to great Cap∣taines,
their posterity to great Lords, their King to
be one of the greatest Potentates on earth, and the
fruites of their labours, his greatest glory, power
and renowne.</P>
<P>That part wee call <HI>New England</HI> is betwixt the
degrees of 41.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The description of New Eng∣land.</NOTE> and 45: but that parte this discourse
speaketh of, stretcheth but from <HI>Pennobscot</HI> to <HI>Cape
Cod,</HI> some 75 leagues by a right line distant each
from other: within which bounds I haue seene at
least 40. seuerall habitations vpon the Sea Coast,
and sounded about 25 excellent good Harbours;
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
In many whereof there is ancorage for 500. sayle
of ships of any burthen; in some of them for
5000: And more then 200 Iles ouergrowne
with good timber, of diuers sorts of wood, which
doe make so many harbours as requireth a lon∣ger
time then I had, to be well discouered.</P>
<P>The principall habitation Northward we were
at,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The particular C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>untries or Gouernments.</NOTE> was <HI>Pennobscot▪</HI> Southward along the Coast and
vp the Riuers we found <HI>Mecadacut, Segocket, Pem∣maquid,
Nusconcus, Kenebeck, Sagadahock,</HI> and <HI>Au∣moughaawgen;</HI>
And to those Countries belong the
people of <HI>Segotago, Paghhuntanuck, Pocopassum,
Taughtanakagnet, Warbigganus, Nassaque, Mashero∣squeck,
Wawrigweck, Moshoquen, Wakcogo, Passhara∣nack,
&amp;c.</HI> To these are allied the Countries of <HI>Au∣cocisco,
Accominticus, Passataquack, Aggawom,</HI> &amp; <HI>Na∣emkeck:</HI>
all these, I could perceiue, differ little in
language, fashion, or gouernment: though most be
Lords of themselues, yet they hold the <HI>Bashabes</HI> of
<HI>Pennobscot,</HI> the chiefe and greatestamongst them.</P>
<P>The next I can remēber by name are <HI>Mattahunts;</HI>
two pleasant Iles of groues, gardens and corne
fields a league in the Sea from the Mayne. Then
<HI>Totant, Massachuset, Pocapawmet, Quonahassit, Sa∣goquas,
Nahapassumkeck, Topeent, Seccasaw, Totheet,
Nasnocomacack, Accomack, Chawum;</HI> Then <HI>Cape
Cod</HI> by which is <HI>Pawmet and</HI> the Ile <HI>Nawset,</HI> of the

are called <HI>Massachusets;</HI> of another language,
humor and condition: For their trade and mar∣chandize;
to each of their habitations they haue
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>
diuerse Townes and people belonging; and by
their relations and desriptions, more then 20
seuerall Habitations and Riuers that stretch them∣selues
farre vp into the Countrey, euen to the bor∣ders
of diuerse great Lakes, where they kill and
take most of their Beuers and Ouers. From <HI>Pen∣nobscot</HI>
to <HI>Sagadahock</HI> this Coast is all Mountainous
and Iles of huge Rocks, but ouergrowen with all
sorts of excellent good woodes for building hou∣ses,
boats, barks or shippes; with an incredible a∣bundance
of most sorts of fish, much fowle, and
sundry sorts of good fruites for mans vse.</P>
<P>Betwixt <HI>Sagadahock</HI> and <HI>Sowocatuck</HI> there is but
two or three sandy Bayes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mixture of an excellent soyle.</NOTE> but betwixt that and
<HI>Cape God</HI> very many: especialy the Coast of the
<HI>Massachusets</HI> is so indifferently mixed with high
clayie or sandy cliffes in one place, &amp; then tracts of
large long ledges of diuers sorts, and quarries of
stones in other places so strangely diuided with
tinctured veines of diuers colours: as, Free stone
for building, Slate for tiling, smooth stone to
make Fornaces and Forges for glasse or iron, and
iron ore sufficient, conueniently to melt in them:
but the most part so resembleth the Coast of <HI>De∣uonshire,</HI>
I thinke most of the cliffes would make
such lime-stone: If they be not of these qualities,
they are so like, they may deceiue a better iudge∣ment
then mine; all which are so neere adioyning
to those other aduantages I obserued in these
parts, that if the Ore proue as good iron &amp; steele
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> those parts, as I know it is within the bounds of
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
the Countrey, I dare engage my head (hauing but
men skilfull to worke the simples there grow∣ing)
to haue all things belonging to the building
the rigging of shippes of any proportion, and
and good marchandize for the fraught, within a
square of 10 or 14 leagues: and were it for a good
rewarde, I would not feare to prooue it in a lesse
limitation.</P>
<P>And surely by reason of those sandy cliffes and
cliffes of rocks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A proofe of an excellent tem∣per.</NOTE> both which we saw so planted with
Gardens and Corne fields, and so well inhabited
with a goodly, strong and well proportioned peo∣ple,
besides the greatnesse of the Timber growing
on them, the greatnesse of the fish and the mode∣rate
temper of the ayre (for of twentie fiue, not a∣ny
was sicke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A proofe of health.</NOTE> but two that were many yeares dis∣eased
before they went, not withstanding our bad
lodging and accidentall diet) who can but ap∣prooue
this a most excellent place, both for health
&amp; fertility? And of all the foure parts of the world
that I haue yet seene not inhabited, could I haue
but meanes to transport a Colonie, I would rather
liue here then any where: and if it did not main∣taine
if selfe, were wee but once indifferently well
fitted, let vs starue.</P>
<P>The maine Staple, from hence to bee extracted
for the present to produce the rest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">St<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ple com∣modities pre∣sent.</NOTE> is fish; which
howeuet it may seeme a mean and a base commo∣ditie:
yet who who will but truely take the pains
and consider the sequell, I thinke will allow it well
worth the labour. It is strange to see what great
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
aduentures the hopes of setting forth men of war
to rob the industrious innocent, would procure;
or such massie promises in grosse: though more
are choked then well fedde with such hastie hopes.
But who doth not know that the poore Hollan∣ders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hollan∣ders fishing.</NOTE>
chiefly by fishing, at a great charge and la∣bour
in all weathers in the open Sea, are made a
people so hardy, and industrious? and by the
venting this poore commodity to the Easterlings
for as meane, which is Wood, Flax, Pitch, Tarre,
Rosin, Cordage, and such like (which they ex∣change
againe, to the French, Spaniards, Portu∣gales,
and English, &amp;c. for what they want) are
made so mighty, strong and rich, as no State
but <HI>Venice,</HI> of twice their magnitude, is so
well furnished with so many faire Cities, goodly
Townes, strong Fortresses, &amp; that aboundance of
shipping and all sorts of marchandize, as well of
Golde, Siluer, Pearles, Diamonds, Pretious stones,
Silkes, Veluets, and Cloth of golde; as Fish, Pitch,
Wood, or such grosse commodities? What Voy∣ages
and Discoueries, East and West, North and
South, yea about the world, make they? What
an Army by Sea and Land, haue they long main∣tained
in despite of one of the greatest Princes of
the world? and neuer could the Spaniard with
all his Mynes of golde and Siluer, pay his debts,
his friends, &amp; army, halfe so truly, as the Hollan∣ders
stil haue done by this contemptible trade of
fish. Diuers (I know) may alledge, many other assi∣stances:
But this is their Myne; and the Sea the
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
source of those siluered streames of all their ver∣tue;
which hath made them now the very mira∣cle
of industrie, the pattern of perfection for these
affaires: and the benefit of fishing is that <HI>Primum
mobile</HI> that turnes all their <HI>Spheres</HI> to this height of
plentie, strength, honour and admiration.</P>
<P>Herring, Cod, and Ling, is that triplicitie that
makes their wealth &amp; shippings multiplicities, such
as it is, and from which (few would thinke it) they
yearly draw at least one million &amp; a halfe of pounds
starling;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which is fifteen hundred thou and pound.</NOTE> yet it is most certaine (if records be true):
and in this faculty they are so naturalized, and of
their vents so certainely acquainted, as there is no
likelihood they will euer bee paralleld, hauing 2
or 3000 Busses, Flat bottomes, Sword pinks,
Todes, and such like, that breedes them Saylers,
Mariners, Souldiers and Marchants, neuer to be
wrought out of that trade, and fit for any other.
I will not deny but others may gaine as well as
they, that will vse it, though not so certainely, nor
so much in quantity; for want of experience. And
this Herring they take vpon the Coast of <HI>Scotland</HI>
and <HI>England;</HI> their Cod and Ling, vpon the Coast
of <HI>Izeland</HI> and in the North Seas.</P>
<P><HI>Hamborough,</HI> &amp; the <HI>East Countries,</HI> for Sturgion

<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
skinny Poore-Iohn, and Corfish, which at least
yearely amounts to 3 or 400000 pound. If from
all those parts such paines is taken for this poore
gaines of fish, and by them hath neither meate,
drinke, nor clothes, wood, iron, nor steele, pitch,
tarre, nets, leades, salt, hookes, nor lines, for
shipping, fishing, nor prouision, but at the second,
third, fourth, or fift hand, drawne from so many
seuerall parts of the world ere they come together
to be vsed in this voyage: If these I say can gaine,
and the Saylers liue going for shares, lesse then
the third part of their labours, and yet spend as
much time in going and comming, as in staying
there, so short is the season of fishing; why
should wee more doubt, then <HI>Holland, Portugale,
Spaniard, French,</HI> or other, but to doe much bet∣ter
then they, where there is victuall to feede vs,
wood of all sorts, to build Boats, Ships, or Barks;
the fish at our doores, pitch, tarre, masts, yards,
and most of other necessaries onely for making?
And here are no hard Landlords to racke vs with
high rents, or extorted fines to consume vs, no tedi∣ous
pleas in law to consume vs with their many
years disputations for Iustice: no multitudes to
occasion such impediments to good orders, as in
popular States. So freely hath God &amp; his Maiesty
bestowed those blessings on thē that will attempt
to obtaine them, as here euery man may be master
and owner of his owne labour and land; or the
greatest part in a small time. If hee haue nothing
but his hands, he may set vp this trade; and by in∣dustrie
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
quickly grow rich; spending but halfe that
time wel, w<SUP>ch</SUP> in <HI>England</HI> we abuse in idlenes, worse
or as ill. Here is ground also as good as any lyeth in

which is as temperate and as fruitfull as any other
paralell in the world.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Examples of the altitude comparatiuely.</NOTE> As for example, on this side

<P>In <HI>France,</HI> the Prouinces of <HI>Gasconie, Langadock,
Auignon, Prouince, Dolphine, Pyamont,</HI> and <HI>Turyne,</HI>
are in the same paralel: which are the best &amp; richest
parts of <HI>France.</HI> In <HI>Italy,</HI> the prouinces of <HI>Genua,

famous Sate of <HI>Venice,</HI> the Dukedoms of <HI>Bononia,
Mantua, Ferrara, Rauenna, Bolognia, Florence, Pisa,
Sienna, Vrbine, Ancona,</HI> and the ancient Citie and
Countrey of <HI>Rome,</HI> with a great part of the great
Kingdome of <HI>Naples.</HI> In <HI>Slauonia, Istrya,</HI> and <HI>Dal∣matia,</HI>
with the Kingdomes of <HI>Albania.</HI> In <HI>Gre∣cia,</HI>
that famous Kingdome of <HI>Macedonia, Bulga∣ria,
Thessalia, Thracia,</HI> or <HI>Romania,</HI> where is seated
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
the most pleasant and plētifull Citie in <HI>Europe, Con∣stantinople.</HI>
In <HI>Asia</HI> also, in the same latitude, are
the temperatest parts of <HI>Natolia, Armenia, Persia,</HI>
and <HI>China,</HI> besides diuers other large Countries
and Kingdomes in these most milde and temperate
Regions of <HI>Asia.</HI> Southward, in the same height,
is the richest of golde Mynes, <HI>Chily</HI> and <HI>Baldiuia,</HI>
&amp; the mouth of the great Riuer of <HI>Plate,</HI> &amp;c: for all
the rest of the world in that height is yet vnknown.
Besides these reasons, mine owne eyes that haue
seene a great part of those Cities and their King∣domes,
as well as it, can finde no aduantage they
haue in nature, but this, They are beautified by the
long labour and diligence of industrious people
and Art. This is onely as God made it, when he
created the worlde. Therefore I conclude, if the
heart and intralls of those Regions were sought:
if their Land were cultured, planted and manured
by men of industrie, iudgement, and experience;
what hope is there, or what neede they doubt,
hauing those aduantages of the Sea, but it might
equalize any of those famous Kingdomes, in all
commodities, pleasures, and conditions? seeing e∣uen
the very edges doe naturally afford vs such
plenty, as no ship need returne away empty: and
onely vse but the season of the Sea, fish will returne
an honest gaine, beside all other aduantages; her
treasures hauing yet neuer beene opened, nor her
originalls wasted, consumed, nor abused.</P>
<P>And whereas it is said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The particular staple commo∣dities that may be had.</NOTE> the <HI>Hollanders</HI> serue the
<HI>Easterlings</HI> themselues, and other parts that want,
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
with Herring, Ling, and wet Cod; The <HI>Easter∣lings,</HI>
a great part of <HI>Europe,</HI> with Sturgion and
Cauiate; <HI>Cape-blanke, Spaine, Portugale,</HI> and the
<HI>Leuant,</HI> with Mullet, and Puttargo; <HI>New found
Land,</HI> all <HI>Europe,</HI> with a thin Poore Iohn: yet all is
so ouerlaide with fishers, as the fishing decayeth,
and many are constrained to returne with a small
fraught. <HI>Norway,</HI> and <HI>Polonia,</HI> Pitch, Tar, Masts,
and Yardes; <HI>Sweathland,</HI> and <HI>Russia</HI> Iron,
and Ropes; <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Spaine,</HI> Canuas, Wine,
Steele, Iron, and Oyle; <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Greece,</HI> Silks,
and Fruites. I dare boldly say, because I haue
seen naturally growing, or breeding in those parts
the same materialls that all those are made of,
they may as well be had here, or the most part of
them, within the distance of 70 leagues for some
few ages, as from all those parts; vsing but the
same meanes to haue them that they doe, &amp; with
all those aduantages.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The nature of ground ap∣prooued.</NOTE> the ground is so fertill, that questionless it
is capable of producing any Grain, Fruits, or Seeds
you will sow or plant, growing in the Regions
afore named: But it may be, not euery kinde to
that perfection of delicacy; or some tender plants
may miscarie, because the Summer is not so hot,
and the winter is more colde in those parts wee
haue yet tryed neere the Sea side, then we finde in
the same height in <HI>Europe</HI> or <HI>Asia;</HI> Yet I made
a Garden vpon the top of a Rockie Ile in 43. ½, 4
leagues from the Main, in May, that grew so well,
as it serued vs for sallets in Iune and Iuly. All sorts
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>
of cattell may here be bred and fed in the Iles, or
<HI>Peninsulaes,</HI> securely for nothing. In the <HI>Interim</HI>
till they encrease if need be (obseruing the seasons)
I durst vndertake to haue corne enough from the
Saluages for 300 men, for a few trifles; and if
they should bee vntoward (as it is most certaine
they are) thirty or forty good men will be suffici∣ent
to bring them all in subiection, and make
this prouision; if they vnderstand what they doe:
200 whereof may nine monethes in the yeare be
imployed in making marchandable fish, till the
rest prouide other necessaries, fit to furnish vs with
other commodities.</P>
<P>In March,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The seasons for fishing approo∣ued.</NOTE> Aprill, May, and halfe Iune, here is
Cod in abundance; in May, Iune, Iuly, and Au∣gust
Mullet and Sturgion; whose roes doe make
Cauiare and Puttargo. Herring, if any desire
them, I haue taken many out of the bellies of
Cods, some in nets; but the Saluages compare
their store in the Sea, to the haires of their heads:
and surely there are an incredible abundance vpon
this Coast. In the end of August, September, Oc∣tober,
and Nouember, you haue Cod againe, to
make Cor fish, or Poore Iohn: and each hundred
is as good as two or three hundred in the <HI>New∣found
Land.</HI> So that halfe the labour in hooking,
splitting, and turning, is saued: and you may haue
your fish at what Market you will, before they can
haue any in <HI>New-found Land;</HI> where their fishing

Sea; you hauing a double season, and fishing
before your doors, may euery night sleep quietly
a shore with good cheare and what fires you will,
or when you please with your wiues and familie:
they onely, their ships in the maine Ocean.</P>
<P>The Mullets heere are in that abundance, you
may take them with nets, sometimes by hundreds,
where at <HI>Cape blank</HI> they hooke them; yet those
but one foot and a halfe in length; these two, three,
or foure, as oft I haue measured: much Salmon
some haue found vp the Riuers, as they haue pas∣sed:

<P>Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Imployment for poore peo∣ple and father∣lesse children.</NOTE> young boyes and girles Saluages, or any

that cannot spin a thred to make engines to catch
them.</P>
<P>For their transportation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The facility of the plantation.</NOTE> the ships that go there
to fish may transport the first: who for their pas∣sage
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
will spare the charge of double manning their
ships, which they must doe in the <HI>New-found Land,</HI>
to get their fraught; but one third part of that
companie are onely but proper to serue a stage,
carry a barrow, and turne Poor Iohn: notwith∣standing,
they must haue meate, drinke, clothes, &amp;
passage, as well as the rest. Now all I desire, is but
this; That those that voluntarily will send ship∣ping,
should make here the best choise they can,
or accept such as are presented them, to serue them
at that rate: and their ships returning leaue such
with me, with the value of that they should re∣ceiue
comming home, in such prouisions and ne∣cessarie
tooles, armes, bedding and apparell, salt,
hookes, nets, lines, and such like as they spare of
the remainings; who till the next returne may
keepe their boates and doe them many other pro∣fitable
offices: prouided I haue men of ability to
teach them their functions, and a company fit for
Souldiers to be ready vpon an occasion; because
of the abuses which haue beene offered the poore
Saluages, and the liberty both French, or any
that will, hath to deale with them as they please:
whose disorders will be hard to reforme; and the
longer the worse. Now such order with facilitie
might be taken, with euery port Towne or Citie,
to obserue but this order, With free power to con∣uert
the benefits of their fraughts to what aduan∣tage

that prouision of fish to fraught the Ships that they
stay not: and then if the sailers goe for wages, it
matters not. It is hard if this returne defray not
the charge: but care must be had, they arriue in the
Spring, or else prouision be made for them against
the Winter.</P>
<P>Of certaine red berries called Alkermes which

<P>Of Mynes of Golde and Siluer, Copper, and

probabilities of Lead, Christall and Allum, I could
say much if relations were good assurances. It is
true indeed, I made many trials according to those
instructions I had, which doe perswade mee I need
not despaire, but there are metalls in the Coun∣trey:
but I am no Alchymist, nor will promise
more then I know: which is, Who will vndertake
the rectifying of an Iron forge, if those that buy
meate, drinke, coals, ore, and all necessaries at a
deer rate gaine; where all these things are to be had
for the taking vp, in my opinion cannot lose.</P>
<P>Of woods seeing there is such plenty of all sorts,
if those that build ships and boates, buy wood at
so great a price, as it is in <HI>England, Spaine, France,
Italy,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and all other prouisions for
the nourishing of mans life; liue well by their
trade: when labour is all required to take those ne∣cessaries
without any other tax; what hazard will
be here, but doe much better? And what com∣moditie
in <HI>Europe</HI> doth more decay then wood?
For the goodnesse of the ground, let vs take it fer∣till,
or barren, or as it is: seeing it is certaine it
beares fruites, to nourish and feed man and beast,
as well as <HI>England,</HI> and the Sea those seuerall
sorts of fish I haue related. Thus seeing all good
prouisions for mans sustenance, may with this fa∣cility
be had, by a little extraordinarie labour, till
that transported be increased; and all necessaries
for shipping, onely for labour: to which may bee
added the assistance of the Saluages, which may
easily be had, if they be discreetly handled in their

kindes; towards fishing, planting, and destroying
woods. What gaines might be raised if this were
followed (when there is but once men to fill your

that of 200. and goe for <HI>Spaine,</HI> sell it but at ten
shillings a quintall; but commonly it giueth fif∣teen,
or twentie: especially when it commeth first,
which amounts to 3 or 4000 pound: but say but
tenne, which is the lowest, allowing the rest
for waste, it amounts at that rate, to 2000 pound,
which is the whole charge of your two ships, and
their equipage: Then the returne of the money,
and the fraught of the ship for the vintage, or any
other voyage, is cleere gaine, with your shippe of a
100 tuns of Train and oyle, besides the beuers,
and other commodities; and that you may haue

send an ordinarie passage. Then sauing halfe this
charge by the not staying of your ships, your victual,
ouerplus of men &amp; wages; with her fraught thither
of things necessarie for the planters, the salt being
there made: as also may the nets &amp; lines, within a

and sailers, and so employ and encourage a great
part of our idlers and others that want imploy∣ments
fitting their qualities at home, where they
shame to doe that they would doe abroad; that
could they but once taste the sweet fruites of their
owne labours, doubtlesse many thousands would
be aduised by good discipline, to take more plea∣sure
in honest industrie, then in their humours of
dissolute idlenesse.</P>
<P>But,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A description of the Coun∣tries in particu∣lar, and their situations.</NOTE> to returne a little more to the particulars
of this Countrey, which I intermingle thus with
my proiects and reasons, not being so sufficiently
yet acquainted in those parts, to write fully the
estate of the Sea, the Ayre, the Land, the Fruites,
the Rocks, the People, the Gouernment, Religion,
Territories, and Limitations, Friends, and Foes:
but, as I gathered from the niggardly relations in a
broken language to my vnderstanding, during
the time I ranged those Countries &amp;c. The most
Northren part I was at, was the Bay of <HI>Pennob∣scot,</HI>
which is East and West, North and South,
more then ten leagues: but such were my occasions,
I was constrained to be satisfied of them I found
in the Bay, that the Riuer ranne farre vp into the
Land, and was well inhabited with many people,
but they were from their habitations, either fish∣ing
<PB N="24" REF="21"/>
among the Iles, or hunting the Lakes and
Woods, for Deer and Beners. The Bay is full of
great Ilands, of one, two, six, eight, or ten miles in
length, which diuides it into many faire and excel∣lent
good harbours. On the East of it, are the <HI>Tar∣rantines,</HI>
their mortall enemies, where inhabit the
<HI>French,</HI> as they report that liue with those people,
as one nation or family. And Northwest of <HI>Pen∣nobscot</HI>
is <HI>Mecaddacut,</HI> at the foot of a high moun∣taine,
a kinde of fortresse against the <HI>Tarrantines,</HI>
adioyning to the high mountaines of <HI>Pennobscot,</HI>
against whose feet doth beat the Sea: But ouer all
the Land, Iles, or other impediments, you may
well see them sixteene or eighteene leagues from
their situation. <HI>Segocket</HI> is the next; then <HI>Nusconcus,
Pemmaquid,</HI> and <HI>Sagadahock.</HI> Vp this Riuer where
was the Westerne plantation are <HI>Aumuckcawgen,
Kinnebeck,</HI> and diuers others, where there is plan∣ted
some corne fields. Along this Riuer 40 or 50
miles, I saw nothing but great high cliffes of bar∣ren
Rocks, ouergrowne with wood: but where
the Saluages dwelt there the ground is exceeding
fat &amp; fertill. Westward of this Riuer, is the Coun∣trey
of <HI>Aucocisco,</HI> in the bottome of a large deepe
Bay, full of many great Iles, which diuides it into
many good harbours. <HI>Sowocotuck</HI> is the next, in
the edge of a large sandy Bay, which hath many
Rocks and Iles, but few good harbours, but for
Barks, I yet know. But all this Coast to <HI>Pennob∣scot,</HI>
and as farre I could see Eastward of it is no∣thing
but such high craggy Cliffy Rocks &amp; stony
<PB N="25" REF="21"/>
Iles that I wondered such great trees could growe
vpon so hard foundations. It is a Countrie rather
to affright, then delight one. And how to describe a
more plaine spectacle of desolation or more barren
I knowe not. Yet the Sea there is the strangest fish∣pond
I euer saw; and those barren Iles so furnished
with good woods, springs, fruits, fish, and foule,
that it makes mee thinke though the Coast be roc∣kie,
and thus affrightable; the Vallies, Plaines, and
and interior parts, may well (notwithstanding) be
verie fertile. But there is no kingdome so fertile hath
not some part barren: and <HI>New England</HI> is great e∣nough,
to make many Kingdomes and Countries,
were it all inhabited. As you passe the Coast still
Westward, <HI>Accominticus</HI> and <HI>Passataquack</HI> are two
conuenient harbors for small barks; and a good
Countrie, within their craggie cliffs. <HI>Angoam</HI> is the
next; This place might content a right curious
iudgement: but there are many sands at the en∣trance
of the harbor: and the worst is, it is inbay∣ed
too farre from the deepe Sea. Heere are many
rising hilles, and on their tops and descents many
corne fields, and delightfull groues. On the East,
is an Ile of two or three leagues in length; the one
halfe, plaine morish grasse fit for pasture, with ma∣ny
faire high groues of mulberrie trees gardens:
and there is also Okes, Pines, and other woods to
make this place an excellent habitation, beeing a
good and safe harbor.</P>
<P><HI>Naimkeck</HI> though it be more rockie ground (for
<HI>Angoam</HI> is sandie) not much inferior; neither for the
<PB N="26" REF="22"/>
harbor, nor any thing I could perceiue, but the
multitude of people. From hence doth stretch in∣to
the Sea the faire headland <HI>Tragabigzanda,</HI> fronted
with three Iles called the three <HI>Turks heads:</HI> to the
North of this, doth enter a great Bay, where wee
founde some habitations and corne fields: they re∣port
a great Riuer, and at least thirtie habitations,
doo possesse this Countrie. But because the <HI>French</HI>
had got their Trade, I had no leasure to discouer it.
The Iles of <HI>Mattahunts</HI> are on the West side of this
Bay, where are many Iles, and questionlesse good
harbors: and then the Countrie of the <HI>Massachu∣sets,</HI>
which is the Paradise of all those parts: for,
heere are many Iles all planted with corne; groues,
mulberries, saluage gardens, and good harbors:
the Coast is for the most part, high clayie sandie
cliffs. The Sea Coast as you passe, shewes you all
along large corne fields, and great troupes of well
proportioned people: but the <HI>French</HI> hauing re∣mained
heere neere sixe weekes, left nothing, for vs
to take occasion to examine the inhabitants relati∣ons,
<HI>viz.</HI> if there be neer three thousand people vp∣on
these Iles; and that the Riuer doth pearce many
daies iourneies the intralles of that Countrey. We
found the people in those parts verie kinde; but in
their furie no lesse valiant. For, vpon a quarrell wee
had with one of them, hee onely with three others
crossed the harbor of <HI>Quonahassit</HI> to certaine rocks
whereby wee must passe; and there let flie their ar∣rowes
for our shot, till we were out of danger.</P>
<P>Then come you to <HI>Accomack,</HI> an excellent good
<PB N="27" REF="22"/>
harbor, good land; and no want of any thing, but
industrious people. After much kindnesse, vpon a
small occasion, wee fought also with fortie or fif∣tie
of those: though some were hurt, and some
slaine; yet within an houre after they became
friendes. <HI>Cape Cod</HI> is the next presents it selfe:
which is onely a headland of high hils of sand, ouer∣growne
with shrubbie pines, hurts, and such trash;
but an excellent harbor for all weathers. This <HI>Cape</HI>
is made by the maine Sea on the one side, and a
great Bay on the other in forme of a sickle: on it
doth inhabit the people of <HI>Pawmet:</HI> and in the bot∣tome
of the Bay, the people of <HI>Chawum.</HI> Towards
the South and Southwest of this <HI>Cape,</HI> is found a
long and dangerous shoale of sands and rocks. But
so farte as I incircled it, I found thirtie fadom wa∣ter
aboard the shore, and a strong current: which
makes mee thinke there is a Channell about this
shoale; where is the best and greatest fish to be had,
Winter and Summer, in all that Countrie. But, the
Saluages say there is no Channell, but that the
shoales beginne from the maine at <HI>Pawmet,</HI> to the
Ile of <HI>Nausit;</HI> and so extends beyond their know∣ledge
into the Sea. The next to this is <HI>Capawack,</HI>
and those abounding Countries of copper, corne,
people, and mineralls; which I went to discouer
this last yeare: but because I miscarried by the way,
I will leaue them, till God please I haue better ac∣quaintance
with them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Massachusets,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A good Coun∣trie.</NOTE> they report, sometimes haue

alwaies friends with them of <HI>Chawun</HI> and their alli∣ants:
but now they are all friends, and haue each
trade with other, so farre as they haue societie, on
each others frontiers. For they make no such voia∣ges
as from <HI>Pennobskot</HI> to <HI>Cape Cod;</HI> seldom to <HI>Mas∣sachewset.</HI>
In the North (as I haue said) they be∣gunne
to plant corne, whereof the South part hath
such plentie, as they haue what they will from
them of the North; and in the Winter much
more plenty of fish and foule: but both Winter
and Summer hath it in the one part or other all the
yeare; being the meane and most indifferent tem∣per,
betwixt heat and colde, of all the regions be∣twixt
the Lyne and the Pole: but the furs North∣ward
are much better, and in much more plentie,
then Southward.</P>

scarce finde any Baye, shallow shore, or Coue of

Lobsters, or both at your pleasure, and in many
places lode your boat if you please; Nor Iles where
you finde not fruits, birds, crabs, and muskles, or
all of them, for taking, at a lowe water. And in the
harbors we frequented, a little boye might take of
Cunners, and Pinacks, and such delicate fish, at
the ships sterne, more then sixe or tenne can eate in
a daie; but with a casting-net, thousands when wee
pleased: and scarce any place, but Cod, Cuske,
Holybut, Mackerell, Scate, or such like, a man may
take with a hooke or line what he will. And, in di∣uerse
sandy Baies, a man may draw with a net great
store of Mullets, Bases, and diuerse other sorts of
such excellent fish, as many as his Net can drawe
on shore: no Riuer where there is not plentie of
Sturgion, or Salmon, or both; all which are to be
had in abundance obseruing but their seasons. But
if a man will goe at Christmasse to gather Cherries
in <HI>Kent,</HI> he may be deceiued; though there be plen∣tie
in Summer: so, heere these plenties haue each
their seasons, as I haue expressed. We for the most
part had little but bread and vineger: and though
the most part of Iuly when the fishing decaied
they wrought all day, laie abroade in the Iles
<PB N="31" REF="25"/>
all night, and liued on what they found, yet were
not sicke: But I would wish none put himself long
to such plunges; except necessitie constraine it: yet
worthy is that person to starue that heere cannot
liue; if he haue sense, strength and health: for, there
is no such penury of these blessings in any place,
but that a hundred men may, in one houre or two,
make their prouisions for a day: and hee that hath
experience to mannage well these affaires, with for∣tie
or thirtie honest industrious men, might well
vndertake (if they dwell in these parts) to subject
the Saluages, and feed daily two or three hundred
men, with as good corne, fish, and flesh, as the
earth hath of those kindes, and yet make that labor
but their pleasure: prouided that they haue engins,

onely formall temporists, all that their predecessors
got in many years, they lost in few daies. Those by

thy Country, abuse thy selfe, despaire in want,
and then couzen thy kindred, yea euen thine owne
brother, and wish thy parents death (I will not
say damnation) to haue their estates? though thou
seest what honours, and rewards, the world yet
hath for them will seeke them and worthily de∣serue
them.</P>
<P>I would be sory to offend, or that any should
mistake my honest meaning: for I wish good to
all, hurt to none. But rich men for the most part
are growne to that dotage, through their pride in
<PB N="34" REF="27"/>
their wealth, as though there were no accident
could end it, or their life. And what hellish care do
such take to make it their owne miserie, and their
Countries spoile, especially when there is most
neede of their imployment? drawing by all man∣ner
of inuentions, from the Prince and his honest
subiects, euen the vitall spirits of their powers and
estates: as if their Bagges, or Bragges, were so
powerfull a defence, the malicious could not as∣sault
them; when they are the onely baite, to cause
vs not to be onely assaulted; but betrayed and
murdered in our owne security, ere we well per∣ceiue it.</P>
<P>May not the miserable ruine of <HI>Constantinople,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An example of secure coue∣tousness.</NOTE>
their impregnable walles, riches, and pleasures last
taken by the <HI>Turke</HI> (which are but a bit, in compa∣rison
of their now mightines) remember vs, of the
effects of priuate couetousness? at which time the
good <HI>Emperour</HI> held himselfe rich enough, to haue
such rich subiects, so formall in all excesse of va∣nity,
all kinde of delicacie, and prodigalitie. His
pouertie when the <HI>Turke</HI> besieged, the citizens
(whose marchandizing thoughts were onely to
get wealth, little conceiuing the desperate resoluti∣on
of a valiant expert enemy) left the Emp. so long
to his conclusions, hauing spent all he had to pay
his young, raw, discontented Souldiers; that so∣dainly
he, they, and their citie were all a prey to the
deuouring <HI>Turke.</HI> And what they would not spare
for the maintenance of them who aduentured
their liues to defend them, did serue onely their
<PB N="35" REF="27"/>
enemies to torment them, their friends, and coun∣trey,
and all Christendome to this present day.
Let this lamentable example remember you that
are rich (seeing there are such great theeues in the
world to robbe you) not grudge to lend some pro∣portion,
to breed them that haue little, yet willing
to learne how to defend you: for, it is too late
when the deede is a-doing. The <HI>Romanes</HI> estate
hath beene worse then this: for, the meere coue∣tousnesse
and extortion of a few of them, so moo∣ued
the rest, that not hauing any imployment, but
contemplation; their great iudgements grew to so
great malice, as themselues were sufficient to de∣stroy
themselues by faction: Let this mooue you
to embrace imployment, for those whose educati∣ons,
spirits, and iudgements, want but your pur∣ses;
not onely to preuent such accustomed dan∣gers,
but also to gaine more thereby then you
haue. And you fathers that are either so foolishly
fond, or so miserably couetous, or so willfully ig∣norant,
or so negligently carelesse, as that you will
rather maintaine your children in idle wantonness,
till they growe your masters; or become so base∣ly
vnkinde, as they wish nothing but your deaths;
so that both sorts growe dissolute: and although
you would wish them any where to escape the
gallowes, and ease your cares; though they spend
you here one, two, or three hundred pound a yeer;
you would grudge to giue halfe so much in ad∣uenture
with them, to obtaine an estate, which in
a small time but with a little assistance of your
<PB N="36" REF="28"/>
prouidence, might bee better then your owne.
But if an Angell should tell you, that any place yet
vnknowne can afford such fortunes; you would
not beleeue him, no more then <HI>Columbus</HI> was be∣leeued
there was any such Land as is now the well
knowne abounding <HI>America;</HI> much lesse such
large Regions as are yet vnknowne, as well in <HI>A∣merica,</HI>
as in <HI>Affrica,</HI> and <HI>Asia,</HI> and <HI>Terra incog∣nita;</HI>
where were courses for gentlemen (and them
that would be so reputed) more suiting their qua∣lities,
then begging from their Princes generous
disposition, the labours of his subiects, and the
very marrow of his maintenance.</P>
<P>I haue not beene so ill bred, but I haue tasted
of <HI>Plenty</HI> and <HI>Pleasure,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Authors conditions.</NOTE> as well as <HI>Want</HI> and <HI>Mi∣serie:</HI>
nor doth necessity yet, or occasion of dis∣content,
force me to these endeauors: nor am I ig∣norant
what small thanke I shall haue for my
paines; o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that many would haue the Worlde
imagine them to be of great iudgement, that can
but blemish these my designes, by their witty ob∣iections
and detractions: yet (I hope) my reasons
with my deeds, will so preuaile with some, that I
shall not want imployment in these affaires, to
make the most blinde see his owne senselesnesse, &amp;
incredulity; Hoping that gaine will make them af∣fect
that, which Religion, Charity, and the Com∣mon
good cannot. It were but a poore deuice in
me, To deceiue my selfe; much more the King, &amp;
State, my Friends, and Countrey, with these in∣ducements:
which, seeing his Maiestie hath giuen
<PB N="37" REF="28"/>
permission, I wish all sorts of worthie, honest, in∣dustrious
spirits, would vnderstand: and if they
desire any further satisfaction, I will doe my best
to giue it: Not to perswade them to goe onely;
but goe with them: Not leaue them there; but
liue with them there. I will not say, but by ill pro∣uiding
and vndue managing, such courses may be
taken, may make vs miserable enough: But if I
may haue the execution of what I haue proiected;
if they want to eate, let them eate or neuer digest
Me. If I performe what I say, I desire but that re∣ward
out of the gaines may sute my paines, qua∣lity,
and condition. And if I abuse you with my
tongue, take my head for satisfaction. If any dis∣like
at the yeares end, defraying their charge, by
my consent they should freely returne. I feare not
want of companie sufficient, were it but knowne
what I know of those Countries; &amp; by the proofe
of that wealth I hope yearely to returne, if God
please to blesse me from such accidents, as are be∣yond
my power in reason to preuent: For, I am
not so simple, to thinke, that euer any other mo∣tiue
then wealth, will euer erect there a Com∣monweale;
or draw companie from their ease and
humours at home, to stay in <HI>New England</HI> to effect
my purposes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The planters pleasures, and profits.</NOTE> And lest any should thinke the toile
might be insupportable, though these things may
be had by labour, and diligence: I assure my selfe
there are who delight extreamly in vaine pleasure,
that take much more paines in <HI>England,</HI> to enioy
it, then I should doe heere to gaine wealth suffici∣ent:
<PB N="38" REF="29"/>
and yet I thinke they should not haue halfe
such sweet content: for, our pleasure here is still
gaines; in <HI>England</HI> charges and losse. Heer nature
and liberty affords vs that freely, which in <HI>England</HI>
we want, or it costeth vs dearely. What pleasure
can be more, then (being tired with any occasion
a-shore) in planting Vines, Fruits, or Hearbs, in
contriuing their owne Grounds, to the pleasure
of their owne mindes, their Fields, Gardens, Or∣chards,
Buildings, Ships, and other works, &amp;c. to
recreate themselues before their owne doores, in
their owne boates vpon the Sea, where man wo∣man
and childe, with a small hooke and line, by
angling, may take diuerse sorts of excellent fish, at
their pleasures? And is it not pretty sport, to pull
vp two pence, six pence, and twelue pence, as fast
as you can hale and veare a line? He is a very bad
fisher, cannot kill in one day with his hooke and
line, one, two, or three hundred Cods: which dres∣sed
and dryed, if they be sould there for ten shil∣lings
the hundred, though in <HI>England</HI> they will
giue more then twentie; may not both the ser∣uant,
the master, and marchant, be well content
with this gaine? If a man worke but three dayes
in seauen, he may get more then hee can spend,
vnlesse he will be excessiue. Now that Carpenter,
Mason, Gardiner, Taylor, Smith, Sailer, Forgers,
or what other, may they not make this a pretty
recreation though they fish but an houre in a day,
to take more then they eate in a weeke: or? if they
will not eate it, because there is so much better
<PB N="39" REF="29"/>
choise; yet sell it, or change it, with the fisher men,
or marchants, for any thing they want. And what
sport doth yeeld a more pleasing content, and lesse
hurt or charge then angling with a hooke, and
crossing the sweete ayre from Ile to Ile, ouer the
silent streames of a calme Sea? wherein the most
curious may finde pleasure, profit, and content.
Thus, though all men be not fishers: yet all men,
whatsoeuer, may in other matters doe as well.
For necessity doth in these cases so rule a Com∣mon
wealth, and each in their seuerall functions,
as their labours in their qualities may be as profi∣table,
because there is a necessary mutuall vse of
all.</P>
<P>For Gentlemen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Imployments for gentlemen.</NOTE> what exercise should more de∣light

it seemes strange to me, any such should there grow

<P>My purpose is not to perswade children from

wealth to liue on; heere by their labour may liue
exceeding well: prouided alwaies that first there
bee a sufficient power to command them, houses
to receiue them, meanes to defend them, and meet
prouisions for them; for, any place may
bee ouerlain: and it is most necessarie to haue a
fortresse (ere this grow to practice) and sufficient
masters (as, Carpenters, Masons, Fishers, Fow∣lers,
Gardiners, Husbandmen, Sawyers, Smiths,
Spinsters, Taylors, Weauers, and such like) to

It would bee an historie of a large volume,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Examples of the Spanyard.</NOTE> to re∣cite
the aduentures of the <HI>Spanyards,</HI> and <HI>Portugals,</HI>
their affronts, and defeats, their dangers and mise∣ries;
which with such incomparable honour and
constant resolution, so farre beyond beleefe, they
haue attempted and indured in their discoueries &amp;
plantations, as may well condemne vs, of too much
imbecillitie, sloth, and negligence: yet the Authors
of those new inuentions, were held as ridiculous,
for a long time, as now are others, that doe but seek
to imitate their vnparalleled vertues. And though
we see daily their mountaines of wealth (sprong
from the plants of their generous indeuours) yet
is our sensualitie and vnto wardnesse such, and so
great, that wee either ignorantly beleeue nothing;
or so curiously contest, to preuent wee knowe not
what future euents; that wee either so neglect, or
oppresse and discourage the present, as wee spoile
all in the making, crop all in the bloominig; &amp; buil∣ding
vpon faire sand, rather then rough rockes,
iudge that wee knowe not, gouerne that wee haue

should doe too well, force such against their willes
to be idle or as ill. And who is he hath iudgement,
courage, and any industrie or qualitie with vnder∣standing,

the preferment sweete <HI>England</HI> doth afford to all

<PB N="42" REF="31"/>
as a childe, till it be able to goe, and vnderstand
it selfe; and not corrected, nor oppressed aboue it
strength, ere it knowe wherefore. A child can nei∣ther
performe the office, nor deedes of a man of
strength, nor indure that affliction He is able▪ nor
can an Apprentice at the first performe the part of
a Maister. And if twentie yeeres bee required to
make a child a man, seuen yeares limited an ap∣prentice
for his trade: if scarce an age be sufficient
to make a wise man, or a States man, and common∣ly,
a man dies ere he hath learned to be discreet: If
perfection be so hard to be obtained, as of necessi∣rie
there must bee practice, as well as theorick: Let
no man much condemne this paradox opinion, to
say, that halfe seauen yeeres is scarce sufficient, for
a good capacitie, to learne in these affaires, how to
carrie himselfe: and who euer shall trie in these re∣mote

at the ende of seauen yeares occasion enough to vse
all his discretion: and, in the <HI>Interim</HI> all the con∣tent,

<P>Who seeth not what is the greatest good of the

those vnknowne parts of this vnknowne world? By
which meanes hee diues euen into the verie secret
of all his Neighbours, and the most part of the
world: and when the <HI>Portugale</HI> and <HI>Spanyard</HI> had
found the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West Indies;</HI> how many did con∣demn
themselues, that did not accept of that honest
offer of Noble <HI>Columbus?</HI> who, vpon our neglect,
brought them to it, perswading our selues the
world had no such places as they had found: and
yet euer since wee finde, they still (from time to
time) haue found new Lands, new Nations, and
trades, and still daily dooe finde both in <HI>Asia,
Africa, Terra incognita,</HI> and <HI>America;</HI> so that there
is neither Soldier nor Mechanick, from the Lord
to the begger, but those parts afforde them all im∣ploiment;
and discharge their Natiue soile, of so
many thousands of all sorts, that else, by their sloth,
pride, and imperfections, would long ere this haue
troubled their neighbours, or haue eaten the pride
of <HI>Spaine</HI> it selfe.</P>
<P>Now he knowes little, that knowes not <HI>England</HI>
may well spare many more people then <HI>Spaine,</HI> and

not still to search for that they haue not, and know
not; It is strange we should be so dull, as not main∣taine
that which wee haue, and pursue that wee

knowe. Surely I am sure many would taste it ill,
to bee abridged of the titles and honours of their
predecessors: when if but truely they would iudge
themselues; looke how inferior they are to their
noble vertues, so much they are vnworthy of their
honours and liuings: which neuer were ordained
for showes and shadowes, to maintaine idlenesse &amp;
vice; but to make them more able to abound in
honor, by heroycall deeds of action, iudgement,
pietie, and vertue. What was it, They would not
doe both in purse and person, for the good of the
Commonwealth? which might moue them pre∣sently
to set out their spare kindred in these gene∣rous
designes. Religion, aboue all things, should
moue vs (especially the Clergie) if wee were reli∣gious,
to shewe our faith by our workes; in con∣uerting
those poore saluages, to the knowledge of
God, seeing what paines the <HI>Spanyards</HI> take to
bring them to their adulterated faith. Honor might
moue the Gentrie, the valiant, and industrious▪ and
the hope and assurance of wealth, all; if wee were
that we would seeme, and be accounted. Or be we
so far inferior to other nations, or our spirits so far
deiected, from our auncient predecessors, or our

</P>
<P>I confesse, I could haue wished them as many
thousands, had all other prouisions bin in like pro∣portion:
nor would I haue had so fewe, could I
haue had meanes for more: yet (would God haue
pleased wee had safely arriued) I neuer had the like
authoritie, freedom, and prouision, to doe so well.
The maine assistance next God, I had to this small
number, was my acquaintance among the Salua∣ges;
especially, with <HI>Dohannida,</HI> one of their grea∣test
Lords; who had liued long in <HI>England.</HI> By the
meanes of this proud Saluage, I did not doubt but
quickly to haue gotte that credit with the rest of
his friends, and alliants, to haue had as many of
them, as I desired in any designe I intended, and
that trade also they had, by such a kind of exchange
<PB N="46" REF="33"/>
of their Countrie commodities; which both with
ease &amp; securitie in their seasons may be vsed. With
him and diuerse others, I had concluded to inhabit,
and defend them against the <HI>Terentynes;</HI> with a bet∣ter
power then the <HI>French</HI> did them; whose tyranny
did inforce them to imbrace my offer, with no
small deuotion. And though many may thinke me
more bolde then wise, in regard of their power,
dexteritie, treacherie, and inconstancie, hauing so
desperately assaulted &amp; betraied many others: I say
but this (because with so many, I haue many times
done much more in <HI>Virginia,</HI> then I intended
heere, when I wanted that experience <HI>Virginia</HI>
taught me) that to mee it seemes no daunger more
then ordinarie. And though I know my selfe the
meanest of many thousands, whose apprehensiue
inspection can pearce beyond the boundes of my
habilities, into the hidden things of Nature, Art,
and Reason: yet I intreate such giue me leaue to ex∣cuse
my selfe of so much imbecillitie, as to lay, that
in these eight yeares which I haue been conuersant
with these affairs, I haue not learned there is a great
difference, betwixt the directions and iudgement
of experimentall knowledge, and the superficiall
coniecture of variable relation: wherein rumor, hu∣mor,
or misprision haue such power, that oft times
one is enough to beguile twentie, but twentie not
sufficient to keep one from being deceiued. There∣fore
I know no reason but to beleeue my own eies,
before any mans imagination, that is but wrested
from the conceits of my owne proiects, and indea∣uours.
<PB N="47" REF="33"/>
But I honor, with all affection, the counsell
and instructions of iudiciall directions, or any other
honest aduertisement; so farre to obserue, as they
tie mee not to the crueltie of vnknowne euents.</P>
<P>These are the inducements that thus drew me
to neglect all other imployments, and spend my
time and best abilities in these aduentures. Where∣in,
though I haue had many discouragements by
the ingratitude of some, the malicious slanders of
others, the falsenesse of friendes, the trechery of
cowards, and slownesse of aduenturers; but chief∣ly
by one <HI>Hunt,</HI> who was Master of the ship, with
whom oft arguing these proiects, for a plantation,
howeuer hee seemed well in words to like it, yet
he practiced to haue robbed mee of my plots, and
obseruations: and so left mee alone in a desolate
Ile, to the fury of famine, and all other extreami∣ties
(lest I should haue acquainted <HI>Sir Thomas
Smith,</HI> my Honourable good friend, &amp; the Coun∣cell
of <HI>Virginia</HI>) to the end, he and his associates,
might secretly ingrosse it, ere it were knowne to
to the State: Yet that God that alway hath kept
me from the worst of his dissimulations. Notwith∣standing
after my departure, hee abused the Salua∣ges
where hee came, and betrayed twenty seauen
of these poore innocent soules, which he sould in
<HI>Spaine</HI> for slaues, to mooue, their hare against our
Nation, aswell as to cause my proceedings to be so
much the more difficult.</P>
<P>Now, returning in the Bark, in the fift of Au∣gust
<PB N="48" REF="34"/>
I arriued at Plimouth: where imparting those
my purposes to my honourable friende Sir <HI>Fer∣dinando
Gorge,</HI> and some others; I was so in∣couraged,
and assured to haue the managing their
authoritie in those parts, during my life, that I in∣gaged
my selfe to vndertake it for them. Arriuing
at London, I found also many promise me such as∣sistance,
that I entertained <HI>Michaell Cooper</HI> the
Master, who returned with mee, and others of
the company. How hee dealt with others, or o∣thers
with him I know not: But my publike pro∣ceeding
gaue such incouragement, that it became so
well apprehended by some fewe of the Southren
Company, as these proiects were liked, &amp; he furni∣shed
from London with foure ships at Sea, before
they at Plimouth had made any prouision at all,
but onely a ship cheefely let out by sir <HI>Ferdinando
Gorge;</HI> which vpon <HI>Hunts</HI> late trecherie among the
Saluages, returned as shee went, and did little or
nothing, but lost her time. I must confesse I was
beholden to the setters forth of the foure ships that
went with <HI>Cooper;</HI> in that they offered mee that
imploiment if I would accept it: and I finde, my
refusall hath incurred some of their displeasures,
whose fauor and loue I exceedingly desire, if I may
honestly inioy it. And though they doe censure me
as opposite to their proceedings; they shall yet still
in all my words and deedes finde, it is their error,
not my fault, that occasions their dislike: for ha∣uing
ingaged my selfe in this businesse to the West
Countrie; I had beene verie dishonest to haue
<PB N="49" REF="34"/>
broke my promise; nor will I spend more time in
discourie, or fishing, till I may goe with a com∣panie
for plantation: for, I know my grounds.
Yet euery one that reades this booke can not put
it in practice; though it may helpe any that haue
seene those parts. And though they endeauour to
worke me euen out of my owne designes, I will
not much enuy their fortunes: but, I would bee
sory, their intruding ignorance should, by their
defailements, bring those certainties to doubtful∣nesse:
So that the businesse prosper, I haue my de∣sire;
be it by <HI>Londoner, Scot, Welch,</HI> or <HI>English,</HI> that
are true subiects to our King and Countrey: the
good of my Countrey is that I seeke; and there is
more then enough for all, if they could bee con∣tent
but to proceed.</P>
<P>At last it pleased Sir <HI>Ferdinando Gorge,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The occasion of my returne.</NOTE> and Ma∣ster
Doctor <HI>Sutliffe</HI> Deane of <HI>Exceter,</HI> to conceiue
so well of these proiects, and my former imploy∣ments,
as induced them to make a new aduenture
with me in those parts, whither they haue so often
sent to their cōtinuall losse. By whose example, ma∣ny
inhabitants of the west Coūtry, made promises
of much more then was looked for, but their pri∣uate
emulations quickly qualified that heat in the
greater number; so that the burden lay principal∣ly
on them, and some few Gentlemen my friends,
in <HI>London.</HI> In the end I was furnished with a Ship
of 200. and another of 50. But ere I had sayled
120 leagues, shee broke all her masts; pumping
each watch 5 or 6000 strokes: onely her spret saile

<P>At <HI>Fyall,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The one of 200, the other 20.</NOTE> wee were chased by two French Py∣rats,

would make them all slaues: or <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> and
would throw them all ouer board if they shot but
a peece; and that they were entertained to fish,
and not to fight: vntill the Captaine vowed to fire
the powder and split the ship, if they would not
stand to their defence; whereby at last wee went
cleere of them, for all their shot.</P>

<PB N="52" REF="36"/>

yeeld to the fauour of those, against whom there
was nothing but ruine by fighting: But if he would
goe aboard them, in that hee could speake <HI>French,</HI>
by curtesie hee might goe cleere; seeing they of∣fered
him such faire quarter, &amp; vowed they were
Protestants, and all of <HI>Rochell,</HI> and had the Kings
commission onely to take <HI>Spaniards, Portugales,</HI>
and Pyrats; which at last hee did: but they kept
this examinates Captaine and some other of his

of warre went aboard vs, and tooke what they
listed, and diuided the company into their seuerall
ships, and manned this examinates ship with the
Frenchmen; and chased with her all the shippes
they saw: vntill about fiue or six dayes after vp∣on

<P>More: he confesseth that his Captain exhorted

hee would finde meanes to proceed in his planta∣tion:
but <HI>Chambers</HI> and <HI>Minter</HI> grew vpon tearms
they would not;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The gentlemen and souldiers were euer wil∣ling to fight.</NOTE> vntill those that were Souldiers
concluded with their Captaines resolution, they
would; seeing they had clothes, victualls, salt, nets, &amp;
&amp; lines sufficient, &amp; expected their armes: and such
other things as they wanted, the French men pro∣mised
to restore, which the Captaine the next day
went to seeke, and sent them about loading of
<PB N="53" REF="36"/>
commodities, as powder, match, hookes, instru∣ments,
his sword and dagger, bedding, aqua vitae,
his commission, apparell, and many other things;
the particulars he remembreth not: But, as for the
cloath, canuas, and the Captaines cloathes, <HI>Cham∣bers,</HI>
and his associats diuided it amongst them∣selues,
and to whom they best liked; his Captaine
not hauing any thing, to his knowledge, but his
wastecoat and breeches. And in this manner going
from ship to ship, to regaine our armes, and the
rest; they seeing a sayle, gaue chase vntill night.
The next day being very foule weather, this exami∣nate
came so neete with the ship vnto the French
men of warre, that they split the maine sayle on
the others spret sayle yard. <HI>Chambers</HI> willed the
Captaine come aboard, or hee would leaue him:
whereupon the Captaine commanded <HI>Chambers</HI>
to send his boate for him. <HI>Chambers</HI> replyed shee
was split (which was false) telling him hee might
come if he would in the Admiralls boat. The Cap∣taines
answer was, he could not command her, nor
come when hee would: so this examinate fell on
sterne; and that night left his said Captaine alone
amongst the French men, in this manner, by the
command of <HI>Chambers, Minter,</HI> and others.</P>

beeing examined, doe acknowledge and

writen is true.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="37"/>
Now the cause why the <HI>French</HI> detayned me a∣gaine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A double trea∣chery.</NOTE>
was the suspicion this <HI>Chambers</HI> and <HI>Min∣ter</HI>
gaue them, that I would reuenge my selfe, vpon
the Bank, or in <HI>New found Land,</HI> of all the <HI>French</HI> I
could there incounter; &amp; how I would haue fired
the ship, had they not ouerperswaded mee: and
many other such like tricks to catch but opportu∣nie
in this maner of leaue me. And thus they retur∣ned
to <HI>Plimouth;</HI> and perforce with the <HI>French</HI> I
thus proceeded.</P>
<P>Being a Fleet of eight or nine sayle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eet of nine French men of war, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ights with the Spani∣ards.</NOTE> we watched
for the <HI>W'est Indies</HI> fleet, till ill weather separated vs
from the other 8. Still we spent our time about the
Iles neere <HI>Fyall:</HI> where to keepe my perplexed
thoughts from too much meditation of my mise∣rable
estate, I writ this discourse; thinking to haue
sent it you of his Maiesties Councell, by some ship
or other: for I saw their purpose was to take all
they could. At last we were chased by one Captain
<HI>Barra,</HI> and <HI>English</HI> Pyrat, in a small ship, with some
twelue peeces of ordinance, about thirty men, and
neer all starued. They sought by curtesie releefe
of vs; who gaue them such faire promises, as at
last wee betrayed Captaine <HI>Wolliston</HI> (his Liefte∣nant)
and foure or fiue of their men aboard vs, and
then prouided to take the rest perforce. Now my
part was to be prisoner in the gun-roum, &amp; not to
speake to any of them vpon my life: yet had <HI>Barra</HI>
knowledge what I was. Then <HI>Barra</HI> perceiuing wel
these <HI>French</HI> intents, made ready to fight, and <HI>Wol∣liston</HI>
as resolutely regarded not their threats,
<PB N="55" REF="37"/>
which caused vs demurre vpon the matter longer,
som sixteene houres; and then returned their pri∣soners,
and some victualls also, vpon a small com∣position.
The next wee tooke was a small <HI>English</HI>
man of <HI>Poole</HI> from <HI>New found Land.</HI> The great ca∣ben
at this present, was my prison; from whence
I could see them pillage those poore men of all
that they had, and halfe their fish when hee was
gone, they sould his poore cloathes at the maine
mast, by an outcry, which scarce gaue each man
seauen pence a peece. Not long after, wee tooke a
<HI>Scot</HI> fraught from <HI>Saint Michaels</HI> to <HI>Bristow:</HI> hee
had better fortune then the other. For, hauing but
taken a boats loading of suger, marmelade, suckets,
and such like, we discried foure sayle, after whom
we stood; who forling their maine sayles attended
vs to fight. But our <HI>French</HI> spirits were content
onely to perceiue they were <HI>English</HI> red crosles.
Within a very small time after, wee chased foure
<HI>Spanish</HI> shippes came from the <HI>Indies:</HI> wee fought
with them foure or fiue houres, tore their sayles
and sides; yet not daring to board them, lost them.
A poore C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruell of <HI>Brasile,</HI> was the next we cha∣sed:
and alter a small fight, thirteene or fourteen
of her men being wounded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A prize worth 16000 crow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> which was the better
halfe, we tooke her, with 370 chests of sugar. The
next was a <HI>West Ind<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es</HI> man, of 160 tuns, with
1200 hides, 50 chests of cutchanell, 14 coffers of

monethes they kept me in this manner to manage
their fights against the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and be a priso∣ner
when they tooke any <HI>English.</HI> Now though
the Captaine had oft broke his promise, which
was to put me a-shore on the Iles, or the next ship
be tooke; yet at last, he was intreated I should goe
for <HI>France</HI> in the Caruell of sugar: himself resolued
still to keepe the Seas. Within two dayes after, we
were haled by two <HI>West Indy</HI> men: but when they
saw vs waue them for the King of <HI>France,</HI> they
gaue vs their broad sides, shot through our mayne
mast and so left vs. Hauing liued thus, neer three
moneths among those French men of warre; with
much adoe, we arriued at the <HI>Gulion,</HI> not far from
<HI>Rochel;</HI> where instead of the great promises they
alwaies fed me with, of double satisfaction, and
full content, they kept me fiue or six daies prisoner
in the Caruell, accusing me to bee him that burnt
their Colony in <HI>New France;</HI> to force mee giue
them a discharge before the Iudge of the Admi∣ralty,
and so stand to their curtesie for satisfaction,
or lie in prison, or a worse mischiefe. To preuent
this choise, in the end of such a storme that beat
them all vnder Hatches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">My escape from the French men.</NOTE> I watched my opportuni∣ty
to get a-shore in their boat; where-into, in the
darke night, I secretly got: and with a halfe pike
that lay by me, put a drift for <HI>Rat Ile:</HI> but the Cur∣rent
was so strong and the Sea so great, I went a
drift to Sea; till it pleased God the winde so turned
with the tide, that although I was all this fearefull
night of gusts and raine, in the Sea, the space of 12
<PB N="57" REF="39"/>
houres, when many ships were driuen a shore, and
diuerse split (and being with sculling &amp; bayling the
water tired, I expected each minute would sinke
mee) at last I arriued in an oazie Ile by <HI>Charowne;</HI>
where certaine fowlers found mee neere drowned,
and halfe dead, with water, colde, and hunger. By
those, I sound meanes to gette to <HI>Rochell;</HI> where I
vnderstood the man of warre which we left at Sea,
and the rich prize was split, the Captaine drow∣ned
and halfe his companie the same night, within
seauen leagues of that place, from whence I esca∣ped
alone, in the little boate, by the mercy of
God; far beyond all mens reason, or my expectati∣on.
Arriuing <HI>at Rochell,</HI> vpon my complaint to the
Iudge of the Admiralitie, I founde many good
words, and faire promises; and ere long many of
them that escaped drowning, tolde mee the newes
they heard of my owne death: these I arresting,
their seuerall examinations did so confirme my
complaint, it was held proofe sufficient. All which
being performed according to the order of iustice,
from vnder the iudges hand; I presented it to the
English Ambassador then at <HI>Burdeaux,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Thomas Edmunds.</NOTE> where it was
my chance to see the arriuall of the Kings great ma∣riage
brought from <HI>Spaine.</HI> Of the wrack of the rich
prize some 36000. crownes worth of goods came
a shore &amp; was saued with the Caruell, which I did
my best to arrest: the Iudge did promise me I shold
haue iustice; what will bee the conclusion as yet, I
know not.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They betraied mee hauing the broad seale of England and neere twentie sayle of Eng∣lish more, be∣siles them con∣cealed in like manner were be∣trayed that year</NOTE> But vnder the colour to take Pirats and

goods from thence, thogh they take them vpon the
Coast of <HI>Spaine,</HI> are law full prize; or from any of
his territories out of the limits of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Leauing thus my businesse in <HI>France,</HI> I returned
to Plimouth, to find them that had thus buried me
amongst the <HI>French:</HI> and not onely buried mee,
but with so much infamy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">My returne for England, 1615</NOTE> as such trecherous cow∣ards
could suggest to excuse their villanies: But my
clothes, bookes, instruments, Armes, and what I
had, they shared amongst them, and what they
liked; saying, the <HI>French</HI> had all was wanting; and
had throwne them into the Sea, taken their ship,
and all, had they not runne away &amp; left me as they
did. The cheeftaines of this mutinie that I could
finde, I laied by the heeles; the rest, like themselues,
confessed the truth as you haue heard. Now how
I haue or could preuent these accidents, I rest at
your censures. But to the matter.</P>
<P><HI>Newfound-land</HI> at the first, I haue heard, was
held as desperate a fishing, as this I proiect in <HI>New
England. Placentia,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Banke,</HI> were also as doubt∣full
to the <HI>French:</HI> But, for all the disasters happe∣ned
mee, the businesse is the same it was: and the
fiue ships (whereof one was reported more then
three hundred tunnes) went forward; &amp; found fish
so much, that neither Izeland-man, nor New found∣land-man,
I could heare of hath beene there, will
goe any more to either place, if they may goe thi∣ther.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The successe of my vice Admi∣rall and the foure ships of London, from New England.</NOTE>
So, that vpon the returne of my Viceadmi∣rall
that proceeded on her voyage when I spent my
<PB N="59" REF="40"/>
masts, from Plimouth this yeare are gone foure or
fiue saile: and from London as many; onely to
make voyages of profit: where the Englishmen
haue yet bneene, all their returnes together (except
Sir <HI>Fr. Popphames</HI>) would scarce make one a sauer
of neere a douzen I could nominate; though there
be fish sufficient, as I perswade my selfe, to fraught
yearely foure or fiue hundred sayle, or as many as
will goe. For, this fishing stretcheth along the Coast
from <HI>Cape Cod</HI> to <HI>Newfound-land,</HI> which is seauen
or eight hundred miles at the least; and hath his
course in the deepes, and by the shore, all the yeare
long; keeping their hants and feedings as the beasts
of the field, &amp; the birds of the aire. But, all men are
not such as they should bee, that haue vndertaken
those voiages: and a man that hath but heard of an
instrument, can hardly vse it so well, as hee that by
vse hath contriued to make it. All the <HI>Romanes</HI> were
not <HI>Scipioes:</HI> nor all the <HI>Geneweses, Columbuses:</HI> nor
all <HI>Spanyards, Corteses:</HI> had they diued no deeper in
the secrets of their discoueries, then wee, or stop∣ped
at such doubts and poore accidentall chances;
they had neuer beene remembred as they are: yet
had they no such certainties to begin as wee. But,
to conclude, <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eue</HI> did first beginne this
innocent worke, To plant the earth to remaine to
posteritie: but not without labour, trouble &amp; in∣dustrie.
<HI>Noe,</HI> and his family, beganne againe the se∣cond
plantation; and their seede as it still increased,
hath still planted new Countries, and one countrie
another: and so the world to that estate it is. But
<PB N="60" REF="41"/>
not without much hazard, trauell, discontents, and
many disasters. Had those worthie Fathers &amp; their
memorable off-spring not beene more diligent for
vs now in these Ages, then wee are to plant that
yet vnplanted, for the after liuers: Had the seede
of <HI>Abraham,</HI> our Sauiour Christ, and his Apostles,
exposed themselues to no more daungers to teach
the Gospell, and the will of God then wee; Euen
wee our selues, had at this present been as Saluage,
and as miserable as the most barbarous Saluage yet
vnciuilized. The <HI>Hebrewes,</HI> and <HI>Lacedaemonians,</HI> the
<HI>Goths,</HI> the <HI>Grecians,</HI> the <HI>Romanes,</HI> and the rest, what
was it they would not vndertake to inlarge their
Territories, enrich their subiects, resist their ene∣mies?
Those that were the founders of those
great Monarchies &amp; their vertues, were no siluered
idle golden <HI>Pharises,</HI> but industrious iron-steeled
<HI>Publicans:</HI> They regarded more prouisions, and
necessaries for their people, then iewels, riches,
ease, or delight for themselues. Riches were their
seruants, not their Maisters. They ruled (as Fa∣thers,
not as Tyrantes) their people as chil∣dren,
not as slaues: there was no disaster, could
discourage them; and let none thinke they incoun∣tered
not with all manner of incumbrances. And
what haue euer beene the workes of the greatest
Princes of the earth, but planting of countries,
and ciuilizing barbarous and inhumane Nations,
to ciuilitie and humanitie? whose eternall actions,
fill our histories. Lastly, the <HI>Portugales,</HI> and <HI>Spany∣ards:</HI>
whose euerliuing actions, before our eyes will
<PB N="61" REF="41"/>
testifie with them our idlenesse, and ingratitude to
all posterities, and the neglect of our duties in our
pietie and religion we owe our God, our King, and
Countrie; and of want charity to those poore salua∣ges,
whose Countrie wee challenge, vse and pos∣sesse;
except wee bee but made to vse, and marre
what our Fore-fathers made, or but onely tell what
they did, or esteeme our selues too good to take the
like paines. Was it vertue in them, to prouide that
doth maintaine vs? and basenesse for vs to doe the
like for others? Surely no. Then seeing we are not
borne for our selues, but each to helpe other, and
our abilities are much alike at the houre of our
birth, and the minute of our death: Seeing our
good deedes, or our badde, by faith in Christs me∣rits,
is all we haue to carrie our soules to heauen, or
hell: Seeing honour is our liues ambition; and our
ambition after death, to haue an honourable
memorie of our life: and seeing by noe
meanes wee would bee abated of the
dignities &amp; glories of our Prede∣cessors;
let vs imitate their
