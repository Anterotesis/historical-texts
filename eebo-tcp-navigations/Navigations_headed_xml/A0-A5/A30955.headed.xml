<HEAD>A Short View OF <HI>Suffolk</HI> and <HI>Glocester-shire. Ex Illustri Autore</HI> GUIL. CAMDENO.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="Suffolk" TYPE="county">
<HEAD>SUFFOLK</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>N the South of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> hath <HI>Cambridge</HI> on the West, di∣vided from <HI>Essex</HI> Southward by the River <HI>Stow,</HI> the <HI>German</HI> Ocean beating on the East; two Rivers, <HI>little Ouse</HI> and <HI>VVaveny,</HI> running severall wayes from the same Springs between <HI>Norfolk</HI> and it.</P>
<P N="2">2. A Region large, harborous, of a rich soil except Eastward, fruitfull corne-fields, and good pastures, and meadows for fatting cattel, abound∣ing in cheese, and not without woods, and many Parks for Deer adjoyning to Noble Houses.</P>
<P N="3">3. The politick or civil Distribution of this <HI>County</HI> is into 3 Parts, The <HI>Geldable,</HI> St. <HI>Edmunds</HI> Liberty, and St. <HI>Etheldreds.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="2" REF="4"/>3. Near <HI>Cambridg-shire</HI> is seated <HI>Ixning,</HI> of lesser fame now then heretofore, by reason of the vicinity of <HI>New-market,</HI> whither the Trade is carried. <HI>New-market Heath</HI> is a large and spa∣cious Plain, barren and sandy, but green; here men admire at <HI>Devils dike,</HI> as if the Devil had made it, whereas no doubt it was but a Trench made of old by the Inhabitants of this Country, against the Incursions of their Enemies.</P>
<P N="5">5. Onward is St. <HI>Edmunds Bury,</HI> a famous Town, so called from <HI>Edmund,</HI> a most Christian King, whose body, after he was cruelly slain by the <HI>Danes,</HI> was here interred. It flourished much, which K. <HI>Canute</HI> had repaired, and new built the Church, offered his Crown to the holy Martyr, brought in <HI>Monks</HI> with their <HI>Abbot,</HI> and bestowed many Lands upon them, and among the rest, the Town it self. Of the Town and Mo∣nastery, while it stood, hear <HI>Lelands</HI> Testimony, an Eye-witness, <HI>Sol non vidit urbem situ elegantiorem, sic molli delicata pendet in clivo, &amp; ridulus ad Ori∣entem defluit; aut Coenobium illustrius,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="6">6. Near unto <HI>Bury</HI> appears <HI>Rushbrook,</HI> the Seat of the noble Family of the <HI>Iermins:</HI> and not far off <HI>Ikesworth,</HI> and more on the North <HI>Fernham;</HI> and near it <HI>Lidgate,</HI> a Village not to be passed by in silence, being ennobled by the birth of <HI>Iohn Lidgate</HI> Monk, whose wit the Muses themselves framed and adorned, his <HI>English Poems</HI> are of such grace and elegancy. Thus of the Western part,</P>
<P N="8">8. On the South, <HI>Stour,</HI> nigh the Fountain,
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
overflows, and makes <HI>Stour-mere,</HI> and then collecting his waters within banks, visits <HI>Clare,</HI> a noted Town, which shews you the ruines of an old Castle. Thence by <HI>long Melford</HI> rejoycing to see the fair Hospitall built there by Sr. <HI>VVilliam Cordall,</HI> he passeth on to <HI>Sudbury</HI> (Southbury) once the chief Town of this Shire, and yet will not easily yield priority to any other: for it is populous, and a rich clothing Town, governed by a Major yearly chosen out of seven Aldermen.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Edwardston</HI> is not far off, a Town of small note now, and after a few miles <HI>Stour</HI> is en∣creased by the access of the little river <HI>Breton,</HI> which, in no long course, washes two Towns of ancient Names; near the springs, <HI>Bretenham,</HI> now a little one, and having no face of a City; and somewhat Eastward, <HI>Ofton, i. e.</HI> the Town of <HI>Offa</HI> K. of <HI>Mercians;</HI> beneath which is <HI>Hadley,</HI> a Town of good note for clothing.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Stour</HI> having received <HI>Breton</HI> runs down with it, not far from <HI>Bentley,</HI> and after a few miles near <HI>Arwenton,</HI> the Seat of the illustrious Family of the <HI>Parkers,</HI> drowns himself in the Ocean, meeting with the river <HI>Orwell</HI> or <HI>Gipping.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Orwell</HI> floweth even out of the belly of this Country, from two Fountains, the one near <HI>VVulpet,</HI> a Market Town <HI>(Luporum fossa)</HI> the other at <HI>Gipping</HI> a poor Village. At <HI>Norton,</HI> by it, K. <HI>Henry</HI> 8. sought for Golden Mines in vain, and the pits speak as much.</P>
<P N="11">11. Along the same River are seen <HI>Stow,</HI> and <HI>Needham,</HI> two Market Towns, and <HI>Himingston</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
almost on the bank of it, where <HI>Baldwin le Pet∣ture</HI> held Lands by a strange merry Tenure, <HI>per saltum, sufflum, &amp; pettum.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. Nearer the mouth of it appears <HI>Ipswich</HI> (of old <HI>Gippewich,</HI>) of an humble site, the eye, as it were, of this County, a commodious Haven, a great Market-Town of trade, a great multitude of Inhabitants, beautified with Fourteen Churches, and many fair and magnificent Buildings. The Corporation consists of Twelve Burgesses (called <HI>Portmen</HI>) of which the chief are two <HI>Bailieffs</HI> chosen yearly, and as many Iustices out of Twenty-four others. Thus for the Southern part.</P>
<P N="13">13. The Eastern Coasts upon the Sea, run∣ning toward the North. The River <HI>Deben</HI> riseth near <HI>Mendlesham</HI> a market Town, thence visiteth and gives name to <HI>Debenham,</HI> from the deep waies round about it: afterwards it runns by <HI>Vfford</HI> and <HI>Rendolesham</HI> on the other side, and so to <HI>VVoodbridge,</HI> delighted with the neatness of the Town; and then after a few miles is enter∣tained by the Ocean, at <HI>Badsway</HI> Haven.</P>
<P N="14">14. Now the Shore advanceth a little East∣ward, at the mouth of the river <HI>Orns,</HI> which hath its rise near <HI>Framlingham</HI> Castle, and pre∣sently spreads it self as it were into a Lake, on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he West side thereof. This is a very fair Castle, and well fortified, with thirteen Turrets in a great thick wall, and within are many conve∣nient handsome Lodgings. <HI>Orns</HI> having washed a little Town <HI>Parham,</HI> and then <HI>Glemham,</HI> gives
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
name to <HI>Oreford,</HI> and near it falls into the Sea,</P>
<P N="15">15. <HI>Oreford</HI> was a large and populous Town, but now complains of the ungratefull Ocean, for withdrawing himself, and envying her the commodity of her Haven by little and little. In the time of King <HI>Henry,</HI> there is a story, how the Fishermen here caught in their nets a wilde creature, representing in all parts the shape of a man, with a long beard, and much rough hair on his breast; who, at last secretly escaped to the Sea, and was seen no more.</P>
<P N="16">16. Not much higher, in a safe and pleasant Site, lies <HI>Alburg,</HI> between the Vally <HI>Slangden,</HI> where the Sea beats on the East, and the River on the West; a Station for Mariners and Fisher∣men not incommodious, nor unfrequented: Hard by, when the Harvest was spoiled all <HI>England</HI> over by unseasonable weather, in the Year 1555. Peale grew up miraculously, with∣out any earth, amongst the stones, in the beginning of Autumn, and abated the price of Corne, as the Inhabitants relate; Some conjecture, that Pulse by shipwracks is cast upon the shore, and so uses to grow without any miracle. But the like spontaneous Harvest we have observed to be on the shore of Kent every year.</P>
<P N="17">17. Ten miles further, along the Sea-coast you come to <HI>Dunwich,</HI> where <HI>An.</HI> 630. <HI>Felix</HI> the <HI>Burgundian</HI> fixt his Episcopall See, and his Successors a long time governed all the East of <HI>England;</HI> but now the violence of the waves
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
having carryed away the greatest part of it, the Bishops having many ages since removed their Chair thence; It sits in sadness, and al∣most in solitude. A little higher the River <HI>Blith</HI> emptieth it felf into the Sea, on whose bank is seated a small Town, <HI>Blithborow,</HI> which hath a Market by favour of <HI>Iohn</HI> Lord <HI>Clavering.</HI></P>
<P N="18">18. Here runns farther into the East, the Promontory <HI>Easton-ness,</HI> esteemed the most Ea∣stern point of all <HI>Britain;</HI> and is called by <HI>Ptolomy, Extensio.</HI> On the South of it lies <HI>Southwold</HI> in a plain open to the Sea; a Town frequented for the Havens sake, which the river <HI>Blith</HI> entring the sea, makes there; and when the Tide comes, so sur∣rounded with the waters, that it seemeth an Iland, and you would wonder it is not overflown. More inward you have <HI>VVingfield</HI> and <HI>Dunnington:</HI> and not far off <HI>Huntingfeild;</HI> and nearer it <HI>Heven∣ingham,</HI> the seat of a Noble Family that have their name thence: at a little distance is <HI>Hales∣worth,</HI> now the Seat of the <HI>Alingtons.</HI></P>
<P N="19">19. On the North; this Province, as we said, is divided from <HI>Norfolk</HI> by two small Rivers, <HI>Ouse</HI> and <HI>VVaveney;</HI> both which issuing out of a plashy place at <HI>Lophamford,</HI> their springs being very little distant, drive their shallow streams divers wayes. Upon <HI>Ouse,</HI> which runneth West, nothing offers it self on this side worthy of me∣mory: upon <HI>VVaveney,</HI> that runneth East, you shall see <HI>Hoxon</HI> first, enobled by the Martyrdome of <HI>K. Edmund.</HI> Near it, at <HI>Broom,</HI> hath long dwelt the noble Family of <HI>Cornwallis.</HI> Lower is <HI>Eay, i.e.
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
Isle,</HI> so called, because it is watered round about.</P>
<P N="20">20. Thence <HI>Waveney</HI> runns down by <HI>Flixton</HI> (for <HI>Felixton,</HI> from the first Bp. <HI>Felix,</HI> as many other places were also named from him) and almost encompasseth <HI>Bungey.</HI> A little below neer the Bank, you shall see <HI>Mettingham.</HI> And now <HI>Waveney</HI> approaching to the Sea, and attempting in vain to go two wayes thither, one by the River <HI>Garienis,</HI> another by the Lake <HI>Luthing,</HI> makes a fair <HI>Peninsula,</HI> named by some <HI>Lovingland,</HI> by others, more truly, <HI>Luthingland,</HI> from that long and diffused Lake, which beginning at the shore of the Ocean reacheth to the river <HI>Garienis.</HI></P>
<P N="21">21. At the entrance of which <HI>Peninsula</HI> a little Town <HI>Lestroffe</HI> lies upon the Sea, at the end of it <HI>Gorlston.</HI> Inward upon <HI>Waveny</HI> is seated <HI>Somerly,</HI> and higher, where <HI>Garienis</HI> and <HI>Waveny</HI> mingle themselves <HI>Cnobersburg,</HI> which we now call <HI>Burgh-Castle,</HI> being onely ruined walls, enriched with <HI>Roman</HI> Coynes often found there.</P>

<HEAD>GLOCESTER--SHIRE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He primary Seat of the Old <HI>Dobuni,</HI> hath <HI>Monmouth</HI> and <HI>Hereford-shire</HI> on the West, <HI>Worcester-shire</HI> on the North, on the East, <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Warwick-shire; Wilt-shire</HI> and <HI>Somerset-shire</HI> on the South: a Country pleasant and fertile, stretched forth from the Summer-rising of the Sun to winter∣setting.</P>
<P N="2">2. The more Eastern part raising it self in Hills is known by the name of <HI>Cotswold;</HI> the midst is sunk and fallen into a most fruitfull Plain, and watered by the most noble River <HI>Severn,</HI> that gives a vital force and verdure unto the Felds: the more Western part beyond <HI>Severn</HI> is all shaded with Woods.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Region, saith <HI>Malmesbury,</HI> is called from the principall Town, <HI>The Vale of Glocester;</HI> all the Land rich in Corn, and abounding in fruit: You may behold the High-wayes ap∣parrelled as it were were with Apple-trees and Pear-trees, not by the industry of Plantation, but by the very nature of the Soil. A Region, more than any other Province in <HI>England,</HI> plentifull in Vines, of a more delightfull taste, the wines being very gratefull to the palate,
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
and not much inferiour to your <HI>French</HI> wines in sweetness, &amp;c. No marvel so many places in these parts retain the name of <HI>Vineyards,</HI> yielding wine heretofore; and it is rather to be imputed to the ill-husbandry of the Inhabitants, than the decay of Nature, that there is none pressed at this day.</P>
<P N="4">4. The more Western part, on the other side <HI>Severn</HI> (possessed of old by the <HI>Silures</HI>) even to the <HI>Wye</HI> (a River running betwixt <HI>Wales</HI> and <HI>England</HI>) is full of deep woods, the <HI>Forrest of Dean,</HI> so called, either from a little Town of that name, or, as I conjecture, from <HI>Arden,</HI> signifying both among the <HI>Galls</HI> and <HI>Brittains, a wood:</HI> the Forrest is now, since the Iron∣works there, grown thinner than heretofore.</P>
<P N="5">5. Here is <HI>Avone,</HI> of most ancient memory, mentioned by <HI>Antoninus,</HI> now called <HI>Aventon,</HI> a little Village, probably so called from <HI>Avon,</HI> which to the <HI>Britains</HI> signifies a River.</P>
<P N="6">6. The river <HI>Severn</HI> (Brit. <HI>Huffron</HI>) having gone a long journey in a narrower channel, where it first enters this Shire, receives the river <HI>Avon,</HI> and another little stream from the East, between which is seated <HI>Tewkesbury,</HI> so called from <HI>Theoc</HI> the Hermite here, a large and fair Town, having three Bridges, noted for clothing, and whose Mustard for biting is become Proverbial, being made up in balls.</P>
<P N="7">7. Lower, on the bank of <HI>Severn,</HI> lies <HI>Deorhist,</HI> and suffers much damage by the
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
overflowing of the river, when it swells. Here in the midst of <HI>Severn is At<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey,</HI> now the <HI>Eight, i. e.</HI> Island, famous for the single Combate of <HI>Edmund</HI> the <HI>English</HI> King and <HI>Canute</HI> the <HI>Dane.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Severn</HI> goes on in a winding course, and dividing it self, to make an Island of the green and fertile meadowes, washes the City <HI>Glocester,</HI> which <HI>Antonine</HI> calls <HI>Glevum,</HI> the Britains <HI>Caer Glowi,</HI> i. e. <HI>The Fair City.</HI> It was built by the <HI>Romans,</HI> to awe the <HI>Silures,</HI> and a Colony was brought thither, named <HI>Colonia Glevum.</HI> The City is built along upon the river, and the other side is in part fortified by a very strong wall. The Streets are indeed very neat; and they were adorned with many Churches: The principall Church, or <HI>Colledge,</HI> was built by <HI>Aldred</HI> Archbishop of <HI>York,</HI> and had a Dean, with 6 Prebendaries: above the Quire, there is a semicircular vault, a <HI>Whispering-place,</HI> built with that artifice, that a very soft voice is conveyed between the walls, from one end to the other, to the admiration of the hearers.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Severn</HI> bidding farewell to <HI>Glocester,</HI> u∣niteth her divided forces, and fighteth often with a violent Tide, and bends her course to the Ocean, on the way visiting <HI>Barkley,</HI> a Town of good note, having a Major to govern it, and a Castle, honoured by the ancient Nobility of her Lords, the Barons of <HI>Barkley.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. Near unto this, a little rivet <HI>Aven</HI> runs into the <HI>Severn</HI> Sea, at whose springs, scarce
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>
eight miles off the shore, near the Village <HI>Al∣derley</HI> are bred stones in the shape of Cockles and Oysters, which, whether they were living creatures once, or are onely the sports of wanton nature, let the <HI>Physiologers</HI> enquire.</P>
<P N="11">11. Now let us climb the Hills, and view <HI>Cotswold,</HI> so called from the hills (for <HI>wold</HI> signifies a Hill, and the <HI>Cotes</HI> or Folds of sheep, famous for their soft and fine wooll through all Nations. Under these hills are sheltred se∣veral places of especial mark.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>Campden,</HI> or <HI>Camden,</HI> a Market Town of of note: <HI>Hales,</HI> once a most flourishing Monastry, famous for that <HI>Alexander of Hales,</HI> the <HI>Coryphoeus</HI> and chief of Schoolmen: <HI>Sudeley,</HI> a most elegant Castle (the stately House of the Illustrious Lord <HI>George,</HI> late Lord <HI>Chandos</HI> Baron of <HI>Sudeley:) VVinchcomb,</HI> an ancient populous Town (but very poor now, were it not for the Plantation of Tobacco) where <HI>Kenulph</HI> the <HI>Mercian</HI> King erected a fair Monastry, famed for the Reliques of <HI>Kenelm,</HI> a Childe traiterously made away by his Sister, and inserted into the Catalogue of Ma tyrs.</P>
<P N="13">1r3. Near the Eastern bounds of this County is to be seen that celebrious <HI>Roman</HI> way, called the <HI>Fosse,</HI> which comes from <HI>Warwick-Shire,</HI> by <HI>Lemington,</HI> a Station of the <HI>Romans,</HI> (as the <HI>Roman</HI> Coyns there found seem to testifie) and then by <HI>Stow on the wold,</HI> exposed to the cold windes, and <HI>Northleach</HI> (washed by a rivulet of the same appellation) to <HI>Cirencester</HI> or <HI>Ciciter.</HI></P>
<P N="14"><PB N="12" REF="9"/>14. <HI>Ciciter,</HI> a Town of very great Antiquity, <HI>Corinum</HI> in <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> exactly 15 Miles from the <HI>Gloc,</HI> taking the name from the river <HI>Corinus,</HI> or <HI>Churne</HI> (which runns on the South of it, and affords opportunity of Mills) was a place of great dignity, as the <HI>Roman</HI> coyns, Marbles, and other Monuments often found there, do prove. The Fourth part scarce is now inha∣bited, the rest turned into Fields, and ruines of an old Religious House, built as they say by the <HI>Saxons.</HI> The Inhabitants are enriched by clothing, and thankfully remember the bounty of K. <HI>Richard</HI> the first, who gave them power over 7 adjacent Hundreds, to hear Causes, and receive Mulcts and other Emoluments thereby.</P>
<P N="15">15. Among the Dukes of <HI>Glocester</HI> most me∣morable is <HI>Humphry</HI> brother to the renowned King <HI>Henry</HI> the fift; a man of high desert toward the Commonwealth of Learning:</P>
