<HEAD>A TRUE ACCOUNT OF A LETTER SENT FROM VIENNA <DATE><HI>August</HI> the 23d 1683.</DATE></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Declaring the rasing the SEIGE and the Total Over∣throw of all the <HI>Turkish</HI> Army, sent in a Letter from an Eminent <HI>English</HI> Officer under the Duke of <HI>Lor∣raine,</HI> to his Father at <HI>White-Hall.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I am in duty bound to give you Account of my being, as you are the Person from whom I derive it, so I ac∣knowledge my self obliged (next after God, from whose infinite Mercies I do from the bottom of my Heart con∣fess to receive my preservation and well-being) to let you, and my Friends in <HI>England</HI> understand, as well as of my self, the preservation of a great part of Christendom, from the fury, rage and threatning Ruine, of that implacable and universal Enemy the <HI>Turk,</HI> who under the Command of the Grand <HI>Visier,</HI> with a very power∣ful Army, consisting of near an Hundred and Fifty Thousand men, had a very considerable time Beseiged the Imperial City of <HI>Vienna;</HI> for the relief of which the Emperour had confederated all the Friends and Allyes he could in all the adjacent Territories, among which indeed I must say the chiefest was th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> King of <HI>Poland,</HI> whose Conduct and Valour had been sufficiently proved against the <HI>Turks,</HI> by the several considerable overthrows he hath given them, in Defence of that small Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> and together with him the Dukes of <HI>Bavaria, Saxany,</HI> and others of the Princes; of the Empire had joyned as they were able to bring up their Forces so that in effect, with the Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> who Commanded as General all the Im∣perial standing Forces, they had compacted a prety considerable Body with which it was advised they might, with the blessing of God, relieve this miserably distressed City. And thus we marched on to try what could be done, but the King of <HI>Poland</HI> desired First, that he might be a little ac∣quainted with the posture of the Enemy, and to that purpose drew out a considerable party of Horse, and marched on till he came within view of their Leaguer, the Army, especially of Horse, following after with all di∣ligence and Expedition, so that although the <HI>Turk,</HI> had by his Scout and Spies Intelligence, that there was a powerful Army approaching him, yet he drew leisurely out of his Trenches, not dreading, any great Opposition, especially because he was informed of a strong body of the <HI>Bours</HI> of the
<PB REF="2" MS="y"/>Country, who had gathered to an Head not far from him, Now indeed these poor people having been so long oppressed, and driven from their Habita∣tions by the <HI>Turks,</HI> ever since they came before <HI>Vienna,</HI> hearing of the Conjunction of so many good Christian Princes, drawing towards <HI>Vienna</HI> to relieve it, thought it was now time, not to hide themselves any longer in Holes, and therefore addressing themselves to some old Commanders, who were in an equal condition with themselves, they marched on a little too hastily towards the Enemy, who supposing these the greatest Force com∣ing upon him, sent presently a party to dissolve them, which fell with such Violence upon these poor Men, but half armed, and at the First worsted them, and as is supposed destroyed above 1500 on the place; but just at the same Instant the King of <HI>Poland</HI> assisted by the Emperour himself and the others, with a full Body of resolute Horse, fell violently upon the <HI>Turks</HI> Army, who by this time had clearly left their Trenches, and fell upon them with that Conduct, valour and resolution, especially upon the <HI>Janisaries,</HI> that they were soon disordered, and in a short time became a Prey to the Swo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, by which means the <HI>Turks</HI> main Strength and relyance was quite disa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed, and all the rest, who were very numerous, being now bravely as∣saulted on all hands, (for by this time the <HI>Bours,</HI> who had before suffered, some little discomfeiture, by the conduct and advice of their Leaders had rallyed and made considerable Opposition) submitted to a General defeat. Tho I mention onely the conduct of that Heroick King of <HI>Poland,</HI> whose Honour can never be enough applauded, yet his Imperial Majesty was in person an Actor in this memorable Battle, as also several Princes of the Empire, whose Catalogue would swell my Letter to an unpleasing length. It is not computed to be a less Number of the <HI>Turks</HI> slain than 90 or 100000, amongst which is the Grand <HI>Visier</HI> himself, and so many of the <HI>Janisaries,</HI> that 'tis beleived there will hardly escape Twenty of them to carry the News to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> to comfort the Grand <HI>Signiour,</HI> the pursuit is so violent∣ly Prosecuted, and all the passages so warily Guarded. I cannot descend at present to any further particulars, taking advantage of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssenger, whose hast is such that I cannot more nicely inform my sel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being in a great Hurry, as most are at present here, but within few days you shall have a further Satisfaction from,</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>I Have been so intent in relating the Proceedings of the Armies, that I had quite omitted the condition in which we found <HI>Vienna,</HI> who th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> suffici∣ently couragious, yet was in very great distress. The last Storm the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nemy made upon them was forced on with such Violence, that the account the people of the City gave of it, seems, in their own words very proper as they render it, that they came upon them like Mountains of Men, as they appeared, more then Armies, for the <HI>Turk</HI> forced his men on so fast, that they run over one another and those that were slain or beaten down, were but Footsteps and degrees of advantage, to mount the successive Troop to that height, that they could in a manner overlook the City-Walls, and in that manner came pouring on with such a desperation, it was very hard to withstand them. Yet by the Blessing of God, and the weak endeavors of the besei∣ged, they were repelled with a very great loss to the <HI>Turks,</HI> and 'tis thought near 5000 of the Beseiged. Which caused the Governour to send to the General, that he could not possibly withstand such another Assault, which In∣telligence hastened our Army to the relief of it, as you have in this L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ter.</P>
