<HEAD>TO THE GENERALL READER</HEAD>
<P>IN publishing this Essay of my Poeme, there is this great disaduantage against me; that it commeth out at this time, when Verses are wholly deduc't to Chambers, and nothing esteem'd in this lunatique Age, but what is kept in Cabinets, and must only passe by Transcription; In such a season, when the Idle Humerous world must heare of nothing, that either sauors of Antiquity, or may awake it to secke after more, then dull and slothfull ignorance may easily reach vnto: These, I say, make much against me; and especially in a Poeme, from any example, either of Ancient, or Modern, that haue proued in this kind: whose vnusuall tract may perhaps seeme difficult, to the female Sex; yea, and I feare, to some that think themselues not meanly learned, being not rightly inspi∣red by the Muses: such I meane, as had rather read the fantasies of forraine in∣uentions, then to see the Rarities &amp; Historie of their owne Country deliuered by a true natiue Muse. Then, whosoeuer thou be, possest with such stupidity &amp; dul∣nesse, that, rather then thou wilt take paines to search into ancient and noble things, choosest to remaine in the thicke fogges and mists of ignorance, as neere the common Lay-stall of a Citie; refusing to walke forth into the <HI>Tempe</HI> and Feelds of the Muses, where through most delightfull Groues the Angellique harmony of Birds shall steale thee to the top of an easie hill, where in artificiall caues, cut out of the most naturall Rock, thou shalt see the ancient people of this Ile deliuered thee in their liuely images: from whose height thou mai'st behold both the old and later times, as in thy prospect, lying farre vnder thee; then con∣uaying thee downe by a soule-pleasing Descent through delicate embrodered Meadowes, often veined with gentle gliding Brooks; in which thou maist fully view the dainty Nymphes in their simple naked bewties, bathing them in Crystalline streames; which shall lead thee, to most pleasant Downes, where harmlesse Shepheards are, some exercising their pipes, some singing rounde∣laies, to their gazing flocks: If as, I say, thou hadst rather, (because it asks thy labour) remaine, where thou wert, then straine thy selfe to walke forth with the Muses; the fault proceeds from thy idlenesse, not from any want in my industrie. And to any that shall demand wherfore hauing promised this Poeme of the ge∣nerall Iland so many yeeres, I now publish only this part of it; I plainly answere, that many times I had determined with my selfe, to haue left it off, and haue neglected my papers sometimes two yeeres together, finding the times since his Maiesties happy comming in, to fall so heauily vpon my distressed fortunes, after my zealous soule had labored so long in that, which with the general happi∣nesse of the kingdom, seem'd not then impossible somewhat also to haue aduan∣ced me. But I instantly saw all my long nourisht hopes euen buried aliue before my face: so vncertaine (in this world) be the ends of our cleerest endeuors. And what euer is herein that tastes of a free spirit, I thankfully confesse it to proceed frō the continuall bounty of my truly Noble friend Sir <HI>Walter Aston</HI>; which hath
<PB REF="5" MS="y"/>
giuen me the best of those howres, whose leasure hath effected this which I now publish. Sundry other Songs I haue also, though yet not so perfect that I dare cō∣mit them to publique censure; and the rest I determine to go forward with, God enabling me, may I find means to assist my endeuour. Now Reader, for the fur∣ther vnderstanding of my Poeme, thou hast three especiall helps; First the Ar∣gument to direct thee still, where thou art, and through what Shires the Muse makes her iourney, and what she chiefly handles in the Song thereto belonging. Next, the Map, liuely delinearing to thee, euery Mountaine, Forrest, Riuer, and Valley; expressing in their sundry postures; their loues, delights, and naturall si∣tuations. Then hast thou the Illustration of this learned Gentleman, my friend, to explaine euery hard matter of history, that, lying farre from the way of com∣mon reading, may (without question) seem difficult vnto thee. Thus wishing thee thy hearts desire, and committing my Poeme to thy charitable censure, I take my leaue.</P>

<HEAD>TO MY FRIENDS, THE CAMBRO-BRITANS.</HEAD>
<P>TO haue you without difficulty vnderstand, how in this my intended progresse, through these vnited kingdomes of great <HI>Britaine,</HI> I haue placed your (and I must confesse) my loued <HI>Wales,</HI> you shall perceiue, that after the three first Songs, beginning with our French Ilands, <HI>Iernsey,</HI> and <HI>Iersey,</HI> with the rest; and perfecting in those first three the suruay of these sixe our most Westerne Coun∣tries, <HI>Cornwall, Deuon, Dorset, Hamp, Wilt,</HI> and <HI>Summerset</HI>; I then make ouer <HI>Seuerne</HI> into <HI>Wales,</HI> not farre from the midst of her Broad side that lieth against <HI>Eng∣land.</HI> I tearme it her Broad side, because it lieth from <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> stil along with <HI>Se∣uerne,</HI> till she lastly turne sea. And to explain two li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of mine (which you shall find in the fourth Song of my Poeme; but it is the first of <HI>Wales</HI>) which are these,
<Q><L>And ere seauen Books haue end, Ile strike so high a string,</L>
<L>Thy Bards shall stand amaz'd with wonder whilst I sing.</L></Q>
Speaking of seauen Books; you shall vnderstand that I continew <HI>Wales</HI> through so ma∣ny; beginning in the fourth Song (where the nymphes of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> contend for the Ile of <HI>Lundy</HI>) and ending in the tenth; Striuing, as my much loued (the lear∣ned) <HI>Humfrey Floyd,</HI> in his description of <HI>Cambria</HI> to <HI>Abraham Ortelius,</HI> to vp∣hold her auncient bounds, <HI>Seuerne,</HI> and <HI>Dee,</HI> and therefore haue included the parts of those three English Shiers of <HI>Gloster, Worster,</HI> and <HI>Sallop,</HI> that lie on the west of <HI>Seuerne,</HI> within their ancient mother <HI>Wales</HI>: In which if I haue not done her right, the want is in my ability, not in my loue. And beside my naturall inclination to loue Antiquitie (which <HI>Wales</HI> may highly boast of) I confesse, the free and gentle companie of that true louer of his Country (as of all ancient and noble things) <HI>M. Iohn Willi∣am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> his Maiesties Gold-smith, my deare and worthy friend, hath made me the more seek into the antiquities of your Country.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">P</SEG>Ermit mee thus much of these Notes to My Friend. What the Verse oft, with allusion, as supposing a full knowing Reader, lets slip; or in winding steps of Personating Fictions (as some times) so infolds, that suddaine conceipt cannot abstract a Forme of the clothed Truth, I haue, as I might, <HI>Illustrated. Breuity,</HI> and <HI>Plainenes</HI> (as the one endur'd the Other) I haue ioyned; purposely auoyding frequent commixture of different language; and, whensoeuer it hap∣pens, eyther the Page or Margine (specially for <HI>Gentlewomens</HI> sake) summarily interprets it, except where Interpretation aides not. Be∣ing not very Prodigall of my Historicall Faith, after <HI>Explanation,</HI> I oft aduenture on <HI>Examination,</HI> and <HI>Censure.</HI> The Author, in Pas∣sages of <HI>first Inhabitants, Name, State,</HI> and <HI>Monarchique succession</HI> in this Isle, followes <HI>Geffrey ap Arthur, Polychronicon, Matthew</HI> of <HI>Westminster,</HI> and such more. Of their Traditions, for that one so much controuerted, and by <HI>Cambro-Britons</HI> still maintayned, tou∣ching the <HI>Troian Brute,</HI> I haue (but as an Aduocat for the Muse) argued; disclaiming in it, if alledg'd for my own Opinion. In most of the rest, vpon weighing the Reporters credit, Comparison with more perswading authority, and <HI>Synchronisme</HI> (the best Touch-stone in this kind of Triall) I leaue note of Suspicion, or adde coniecturall Amendment: as, for particular examples, among other, in <HI>Brennus</HI> mistooke by all Writers of later time, following <HI>Iustins</HI> Epitome of <HI>Trogus</HI> ill conceiu'd; in <HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Swaphams</HI> Story of K. <HI>Wulphers</HI> murdring his Children; in <HI>Rollo</HI> first D. of <HI>Normandy</HI> his time; none of them yet rectified (although the first hath been aduentu∣red on) by any that I haue seene; and such more. And indeed my Iealousie hath oft vext me with particular inquisition of whatsoe∣uer occurrs, bearing not a marke of most apparant Truth, euer since I found so intollerable Antichronismes, incredible reports, and <HI>Bar∣dish</HI> impostures▪ as well from Ignorance as assum'd liberty of Inuen∣tion in some of our Ancients; and red also such palpable Fauxeties, of our Nation, thrust into the World by Later Time: as (to giue a tast) that of <HI>Randall Higden</HI> affirming the Beginning of <HI>Wards</HI> in <ABBR>VI.</ABBR> <HI>Hen.</HI> <ABBR>III.</ABBR> <HI>Polydores</HI> assertion (vpon mistaking of the Statute of I.

In <HI>Monmouth, Robert</HI> of <HI>Glocester, florilegus,</HI> and their follow∣ers, <HI>Cadwallader</HI> is made the sonne of <HI>Cadwallo</HI> K. of the <HI>Britons</HI> before him, but so, that he descended also from <HI>English-Saxon</HI> bloud; his mother being daugh¦ter to <HI>Penda</HI> K. of <HI>Mercland.</HI> Our Monkes call him K. of <HI>West-Saxons,</HI> successor to <HI>Kentwine,</HI> and sonne to <HI>Kenbrith.</HI> And where <HI>Caradoc Lhancaruan</HI> tels you of warres twixt <HI>Ine</HI> or <HI>Iuor</HI> (successor to <HI>Cadwallader</HI>) and <HI>Kentwine,</HI> it appeares in our Chronographers that <HI>Kentwine</HI> must be dead aboue three years before.

But to satisfie you in present, I keepe my selfe to the course of our ordinary stories, by reason of difficulty in finding an exact truth in all.

Out of <HI>Pliny</HI> receiue their forme of rituall <HI>SACRIFICE</HI> (here described by the Author) thus: In such gloomy shadows, as they most vsually for contempla∣tion retired their ascending thoughts into, after exact search, finding an Oake, whereon a Mistletoe grew, on the VI. day of the Moone (aboue all other times) in which, was beginning of their yeare, they religiously and with inuoca∣tion brought with them to it a ceremoniall banquet, materials for sacrifice, with two white Bulles, filleted on the hornes, all which they plac'd vnder the Oake. One of them, honoured with that function, clothed all in white, climbs the tree, and with a golden Knife or Sith cuts the Mistletoe, which they so∣lemnly wrapt in one of their white garments. Then did they sacrifice the Buls, earnestly calling on the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Omnia Sanan∣tem.</HI></NOTE> <HI>All-healing</HI> Deity, to make it prosperous and happy on whom soeuer they shal bestow it, and accounted it both preseruatiue against all Poisons, and a remedy against Barrennes.

<L>In so reproachfull tearmes and ignominy heare,</L>
<L>By euery one of late contemptuouslie disgra'ct;</L>
<L>That he whom Time so long, and strongly hath imbrac't,</L>
<L>Should be reiected quite? The reason vrged why,</L>
<L>Is by the generall foe thus answer'd by and by:</L>
<L>That <HI>Brutus,</HI> as you say, by Sea who hither came,</L>
<L>From whom you would suppose this Ile first tooke the name,</L>
<L>Meerelie fictitious is; nor could the <HI>Romans</HI> heare</L>
<L>(Most studious of the truth, and neer'st those times that were)</L>
<L>Of any such as hee: nay, they who most doe striue,</L>
<L>From that great stock of <HI>Troy</HI> their linage to deriue,</L>
<L>In all the large descent of <HI>Iülus,</HI> neuer found</L>
<L>That <HI>Brute,</HI> on whom wee might our first beginning ground.</L>
<L>To this Assertion, thus I faithfully reply;</L>
<L>And as a friend to Truth, doe constantlie denie</L>
<L>Antiquitie to them, as neerer to those times;</L>
<L>Their writings to precede our ancient <HI>British</HI> Rimes:</L>
<L>But that our noble <HI>Bards</HI> which so diuinely sung</L>
<L>That remnant of old <HI>Troy,</HI> of which the <HI>Britaines</HI> sprung,</L>
<L>Before those <HI>Romans</HI> were, as proofe we can produce;</L>
<L>§. And learning, long with vs, ere t'was with them in vse.</L>

<L>Our <HI>Geffray</HI> had his <HI>Brute.</HI> Nor were these idle tales</L>
<L><PB N="163" REF="106" MS="y"/>(As he may find, the truth of our descents that seekes)</L>
<L>Nor fabulous, like those deuised by the <HI>Greeks:</HI></L>

<L>Discreetlie euery <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">At the <HI>Steth∣ua</HI>: see to the fourth Song.</NOTE> yeere correcting where they err'd.</L>
<L>And that whereon our Foe his greatest hold doth take,</L>
<L>Against the handled Cause and most doth seeme to make,</L>
<L>Is, that we shewe no Booke our <HI>Brutus</HI> to approue;</L>
<L>But that our idle <HI>Bards,</HI> as their fond rage did moue,</L>
<L>Sang what their fancies pleas'd. Thus doe I answere these;</L>
<L>That th'ancient <HI>British</HI> Priests,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Druides</HI> would not cō∣mit their my∣steries to wry∣ting.</NOTE> the fearlesse <HI>Druides,</HI></L>
<L>That ministred the lawes, and were so trulie wise,</L>

<L>§. To letters neuer would their mysteries commit,</L>
<L>For which the breasts of men they deem'd to be more fit.</L>
<L>VVhich questionlesse should seeme from iudgement to proceed.</L>
<L>For, when of Ages past wee looke in bookes to read,</L>
<L>Wee retchlesly discharge our memory of those.</L>
<L>So when iniurious Time, such Monuments doth lose</L>
<L>(As what so great a Work, by Time that is not wrackt?)</L>
<L>VVee vtterly forgoe that memorable act:</L>
<L>But when we lay it vp within the minds of men,</L>
<L>They leaue it their next Age; that, leaues it hers agen:</L>
<L>So strongly which (me thinks) doth for Tradition make,</L>
<L>As if you from the world it altogether take,</L>
<L>You vtterly subuert Antiquitie thereby.</L>
<L>For though Time well may proue that often shee doth lie,</L>
<L>Posteritie by her yet many things hath known,</L>
<L>That ere men learn'd to write, could no way haue been shown:</L>
<L>For, if the spirit of God, did not our faith assure</L>
<L>The Scriptures be from heauen, like heauen, diuinely pure,</L>
<L>Of <HI>Moses</HI> mightie works, I reuerently may say</L>

<L>In power of humane wit it easely doth not lie</L>
<L>To proue before the Flood the Genealogie.</L>
<L>Nor any thing there is that kindlier doth agree</L>

<L>From some such God-like race we questionlesse did spring,</L>
<L>Who soone became so great heere once inhabiting.</L>
<L>So barbarous nor were wee as manie haue vs made,</L>
<L>And <HI>Caesars</HI> envious pen would all the world perswade,</L>

<P>In the first declining State of the <HI>British</HI> Empire (to explane the Author in this of <HI>Merlin</HI>) <HI>Vortigern,</HI> by aduice of his Magicians, after diuers vnfortunat successes in warre, resolued to erect a strong Fort in <HI>Snowdon</HI> hils (not far from <HI>Conwey's</HI> head in the edge of <HI>Merioneth</HI>) which might be as his last and surest Refuge, against the increasing power of the <HI>English.</HI> Masons were appointed, and the worke begun; but what they built in the day, was alwayes swallowed vp in the earth next, night. The King askes counsell of his Magicians, touching this prodigie: they aduise that he must finde out a childe which had no father,
<PB N="165" REF="107" MS="y"/>
and with his bloud sprinkle the stones and morter, and that then the Castle would stand as on a firme foundation. Search was made, and in <HI>Caer-Merdhin</HI> (as you haue it to the V.

The workmen digged to discover the truth, &amp; found it so.

<L>But after, when the <HI>Danes,</HI> who neuer wearied were,</L>
<L>Came with intent to make a generall conquest here,</L>
<L>They brought with them a man deem'd of so wondrous might,</L>
<L>As was not to be matcht by any mortall wight:</L>
<L>For, one could scarcely beare his Ax into the field;</L>
<L>Which as a little wand the <HI>Dane</HI> would lightly wield:</L>
<L>And (to enforce that strength) of such a dauntlesse spirit,</L>
<L>A man (in their conceit) of so exceeding merit,</L>
<L>That to the <HI>English</HI> oft they offred him (in pride)</L>
<L>The ending of the warre by combate to decide:</L>
<L>Much scandall which procur'd vnto the <HI>English</HI> name.</L>

<L>Thus, whilst with sundry doubts his thoughts perplexed are,</L>

<L>(The Knight through all the world renown'd for Chiualrie)</L>
<L>Arriu'd from forraine parts, where he had held him long.</L>

<L>(Whose strong and constant hart, all grieuous cares supprest)</L>
<L>His due deuotion done, betooke himselfe to rest.</L>
<L>To whom it seem'd by night an Angell did appeare,</L>
<L>Sent to him from that God whom hee invoak't by pray'r;</L>
<L>Commaunding him the time not idly to for-slowe,</L>
<L>But rathe as hee could rise, to such a gate to goe,</L>
<L>VVhereas he should not faile to find a goodly Knight</L>
<L>In Palmers poore attyre: though very meanly dight,</L>
<L>Yet by his comely shape, and limmes exceeding strong,</L>
<L>He easely might him know the other folke among;</L>
<L>And bad him not to feare, but chuse him for the man.</L>
<L>No sooner brake the day, but vp rose <HI>Athelstan;</HI></L>
<L>And as the Vision show'd, he such a Palmer found,</L>
<L>VVith others of his sort, there sitting on the ground:</L>
<L>VVhere, for some poore repast they onely seem'd to stay,</L>
<L>Else ready to depart each one vpon his way:</L>
<L>When secretly the King revealed to the Knight</L>
<L>His comfortable dreames that lately passed night:</L>
<L>VVith mild and princely words be speaking him; quoth hee,</L>
<L>Farre better you are knowne to heauen (it seemes) then mee</L>
<L>For this great Action fit: by whose most drad command</L>
<L>(Before a world of men) it's lay'd vpon your hand.</L>

<L>Refresh you in my bathes, and mollifie your care</L>
<L>VVith comfortable wines and meats what you will aske:</L>
<L>And chuse my richest Armes to fit you for this taske.</L>
<L>The Palmer (gray with age) with countenance lowting lowe,</L>
<L>His head euen to the earth before the King doth bow,</L>
<L>Him softly answering thus; Drad Lord, it fits mee ill</L>
<L>(A wretched man) t'oppose high heauens eternall will:</L>
<L>Yet my most soueraigne Liege, no more of me esteeme</L>
<L>Then this poore habit showes, a Pilgrim as I seeme;</L>
<L>But yet I must confesse, haue seene in former dayes</L>
<L>The best Knights of the world, and scuffled is some frayes.</L>
<L>Those times are gone with me; and, beeing aged now,</L>
<L>Haue offred vp my Armes, to Heau'n and made my vow</L>
<L>Nere more to beare a Shield, nor my declining age</L>
<L>(Except some Palmers Tent, or homely Hermitage)</L>
<L>Shall euer enter roofe: but if, by Heauen and thee,</L>
<L>This Action be impos'd great <HI>English</HI> King on mee,</L>
<L>Send to the <HI>Danish</HI> Campe, their challenge to accept,</L>
<L>In some conuenient place proclaiming it be kept:</L>
<L><PB N="200" REF="127"/>VVhere, by th'Almighties power, for <HI>England</HI> Ile appeare.</L>
<L>The King, much pleas'd in mind, assumes his wonted cheere,</L>
<L>And to the <HI>Danish</HI> power his choicest Herault sent.</L>
<L>When, both through Campe and Court, this Combat quickly went.</L>
<L>VVhich suddainly divulg'd, whilst euery listning eare,</L>
<L>As thirsting after newes, desirous was to heare,</L>
<L>VVho for the <HI>English</HI> side durst vnder-take the day;</L>
<L>The puissant Kings accord, that in the middle way</L>
<L>Betwixt the Tent and Towne, to eithers equall sight,</L>
<L>Within a goodly Mead, most fit for such a fight,</L>
<L>The Lists should be prepar'd for this materiall prize.</L>
<L>The day prefixt once com'n, both <HI>Dane</HI> and <HI>English</HI> rise,</L>
<L>And to th'appointed place th'vnnumbred people throng:</L>
<L>The weaker female sex, old men, and children young</L>
<L>Into the windowes get, and vp on stalls, to see</L>
<L>The man on whose braue hand their hope that day must bee.</L>
<L>In noting of it well, there might a man behold</L>
<L>More sundry formes of feare then thought imagine could.</L>
<L>One looks vpon his friend with sad and heauy cheere,</L>
<L>Who seemes in this distresse a part with him to beare:</L>
<L>Their passions doe expresse much pittie mixt with rage.</L>
<L>VVhilst one his wiues laments is labouring to asswage,</L>
<L>His little infant neere, in childish gibbridge showes</L>
<L>What addeth to his griefe who sought to calme her woes.</L>
<L>One hauing climb'd some roofe, the concourse to discry,</L>
<L>From thence vpon the earth deiects his humble eye,</L>
<L>As since he thither came hee suddainly had found</L>
<L>Some danger them amongst which lurkt vpon the ground.</L>
<L>One stands with fixed eyes, as though he were agast:</L>
<L>Another sadly comes, as though his hopes were past.</L>
<L>This harkneth with his friend, as though with him to breake</L>
<L>Of some intended act. Whilst they together speake,</L>
<L>Another standeth neere to listen what they say,</L>
<L>Or what should be the end of this so doubtfull day.</L>
<L>One great and generall face the gathered people seeme:</L>
<L>So that the perfect'st sight beholding could not deeme</L>
<L>What lookes most sorrow show'd; their griefes so equall were.</L>
<L>Vpon the heads of two, whose che<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kes were ioynd so neere</L>
<L>As if together growne, a third his chin doth rest:</L>
<L>Another lookes or'e his: and others, hardly prest,</L>
<L>Lookt vnder-neath their armes. Thus, whilst in crowds they throng</L>
<L>(Led by the King himselfe) the Champion comes along;</L>
<L>A man well strooke in yeeres, in homely Palmers gray,</L>
<L>And in his hand his staffe, his reuerent steps to stay,</L>
<L>Holding a comly pase: which at his passing by,</L>
<L>In euery censuring tongue, as euery serious eye,</L>
<L><PB N="201" REF="127"/>Compassion mixt with feare, distrust and courage, bred.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Colebrond</HI> for the <HI>Danes</HI> came forth in irefull red;</L>
<L>Before him (from the Campe) an Ensigne first display'd</L>
<L>Amidst a guard of gleaues: then sumptuously array'd</L>
<L>Were twenty gallant youths, that to the warlike sound</L>
<L>Of <HI>Danish</HI> brazen Drums, with many a loftie bound,</L>
<L>Come with their Countries march, as they to <HI>Mars</HI> should dance.</L>
<L>Thus, forward to the fight, both Champions them advance:</L>
<L>And each without respect doth resolutely chuse</L>
<L>The weapon that he brought, nor doth his foes refuse.</L>
<L>The <HI>Dane</HI> prepares his Axe, that pond'rous was to feele,</L>
<L>VVhose squares were layd with plates, and riuited with steele,</L>
<L>And armed downe along with pykes; whose hardned poynts</L>
<L>(Forc't with the weapons weight) had power to teare the ioynts</L>
<L>Of Curas or of Mayle, or what-so-ere they tooke:</L>
<L>Which caus'd him at the Knight disdainfully to looke.</L>
<L>VVhen our stout Palmer soone (vnknowne for valiant <HI>Guy</HI>)</L>
<L>The cord from his straight loynes doth presently vntie,</L>
<L>Puts off his Palmers weede vnto his trusse, which bore</L>
<L>The staines of ancient Armes, but show'd it had before</L>
<L>Beene costly cloth of Gold; and off his hood he threw:</L>
<L>Out of his Hermits staffe his two-hand sword hee drew</L>
<L>(The vnsuspected sheath which long to it had beene)</L>
<L>Which till that instant time the people had not seene;</L>
<L>A sword so often try'd. Then to himselfe, quoth hee,</L>
<L>Armes let me craue your ayde, to set my Country free:</L>
<L>And neuer shall my hart your help againe require,</L>
<L>But onely to my God to lift you vp in pray'r.</L>
<L>Here, <HI>Colebrond</HI> forward made, and soone the Christian Knight</L>
<L>Encounters him againe with equall power and spight:</L>
<L>Whereas, betwixt them two, might easely haue been seene</L>
<L>Such blowes, in publique throngs as vsed had they been,</L>
<L>Of many there the least might many men haue slaine:</L>
<L>Which none but they could strike, nor none but they sustaine;</L>
<L>The most relentlesse eye that had the power to awe,</L>
<L>And so great wonder bred in those the Fight that saw,</L>
<L>As verily they thought, that Nature vntill then</L>
<L>Had purposely reseru'd the vtmost power of men,</L>
<L>VVhere strength still answerd strength, on courage courage grew.</L>
<L>Looke how two Lyons fierce, both hungry, both pursue</L>
<L>One sweet and selfe-same prey, at one another flie,</L>

<L>The blood dropt softly downe, as if the wound had sense</L>
<L>Of their much inward woe that it with griefe should see.</L>

<L>As though the blood that fell, vpon their cheekes had staid.</L>
<L>Here <HI>Guy,</HI> his better spirits recalling to his ayde,</L>

<L>The Palmer, of the two the first recouering strength,</L>

<L>And striuing to preferre their Sonne, the best they may,</L>
<L>Set forth the lusty Flood, in rich and braue array,</L>
<L>Bankt with imbrodered Meads, of sundry sutes of flowres,</L>

<L>And whil'st they sadly wept at parting of their Sonne,</L>
<L>See what the <HI>Tames</HI> befell, when t'was suspected least.</L>
<L>As still his goodly traine yet euery houre increast,</L>

<L>Whose eyes so pierc't his breast, that seeming to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reslowe</L>

This Peace, vpon denial of paiment (which had the better colour, because, at request of Q. <HI>Maude,</HI> the Duke prodigally released his M.M. pounds the next yeere after the Couenant) was soone broken.

<L>VVhen as the Riuer downe, through <HI>Andredsweald</HI> dooth run:</L>
<L>Nor can the aged Hill haue comfort of her childe.</L>

<L>Fled from him, whom they sure a Satyre thought to be;</L>
<L>As Satyre-like he held all pleasures in disdaine,</L>
<L>And would not once vouchsafe, to look vpon a Plaine▪</L>
<L>Till chancing in his course he to view a goodly plot,</L>
<L>Which <HI>Albion</HI> in his youth, vpon a Sea Nymph got,</L>
<L>For <HI>Oxney's</HI> loue he pines▪ who being wildly chaste,</L>
<L>And neuer woo'd before, was coy to be imbrac't.</L>
<L>But, what obdurate heart was euer so peruerse,</L>
<L>Whom yet a louers plaints, with patience, could not pearce?</L>
<L>For, in this conflict she being lastly o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erthrowne,</L>
<L>In-Iled in his Armes, he clips her for his owne.</L>
<L>Who being grosse and black, she lik't the Riuer well.</L>
<L>Of <HI>Rothers</HI> happy match, when <HI>Rumney</HI> Marsh heard tell,</L>

<L>Appearing to the Flood, most brauely like a Queene,</L>
<L>Clad (all) from head to foot, in gaudy Summers green;</L>
<L>Her mantle richly wrought, with sundry flowers and weeds;</L>
<L>Her moystfull temples bound, with wreaths of quiuering reeds:</L>
<L>Which loosely flowing downe, vpon her lusty thighes,</L>
<L>Most strongly seeme to tempt the Riuers amorous eyes.</L>
<L>And on her loynes a frock, with many a swelling pleate,</L>
<L>Embost with well-spread Horse, large Sheepe, and full-fed Neate.</L>
<L>Some wallowing in the grasse, there lie a while to batten;</L>
<L>Some sent away to kill; some thither brought to fatten;</L>
<L>With Villages amongst, oft powthred heere and there;</L>
<L>And (that the same more like to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The naturall expressing of the surface of a Country in Painting.</NOTE> Landskip should appeare)</L>

<L>That to a constant course, she thus perswades her Loue:</L>
<L>With <HI>Rumney,</HI> though for dower I stand in no degree;</L>
<L>In this, to be belou'd yet liker farre then she:</L>
<L>Though I be browne, in me there doth no fauour lack.</L>
<L>The foule is said deform'd: and she, extreamely black.</L>

<P>OVt of <HI>Sussex,</HI> into its Easterne neighbor, <HI>Kent,</HI> this Canto leads you. It begins with <HI>Rother,</HI> whose running through the woods, inisling <HI>Oxney,</HI> and such like, poetically here describ'd is plaine enough to any apprehending conceit; and vpon <HI>Medway's</HI> Song of our Martiall and Heroique spirits, be∣cause a large volume might be written to explane their glorie in particular a∣ction, and in lesse comprehension without wrong to many worthies its not performable, I haue omitted all Illustration of that kind, and left you to the Muse her selfe.</P>
