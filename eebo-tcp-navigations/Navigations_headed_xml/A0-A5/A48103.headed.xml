<HEAD>A <HI>LETTER, giving a</HI> Description <HI>of the</HI> Isthmus <HI>of</HI> Darian, (<HI>where the</HI> Scot's Colony <HI>is settled</HI>) <HI>from a</HI> Gen∣tleman <HI>who lives there at present.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>COnform to your Desire, and mine own Promise: I have sent You the following Description of <HI>Darian;</HI> I was up the Country when the two Gentlemen went for <HI>Scotland</HI> who brought the News of our arrival: but having now an Occasion I have sent you the following Account.</P>
<P>You desired a particular Account of the said <HI>Darian,</HI> long since, And according to your Desire, I have sent a particular Account of the <HI>Nature</HI> of the <HI>Ground, Animals, Fruits,</HI> and <HI>Trees;</HI> and what <HI>Minerals</HI> they have, with a Draught of the Place, The <HI>Habits</HI> of their <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Queens,</HI> The <HI>Form</HI> of their <HI>Houses,</HI> The <HI>Way</HI> of their <HI>Fighting</HI> with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and other Enemies.</P>
<P>Since our safe Arrival We have vieued, transvers'd, and gone about near an hundered Miles in the Country formerly called <HI>Darian:</HI> but We have named it <HI>CALEDONIA,</HI> and there is a Fort very conveniently built, which We call <HI>New-EDINBƲRGH.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darian</HI> is situated in the <HI>Main-Land</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>America,</HI> on the North of the <HI>Equinoctial Line,</HI> 8 <HI>degr.</HI> 11 <HI>min. Latitude;</HI> The Land is narrower from the <HI>North</HI> to
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>the <HI>South</HI> Sea, which you will see by the <HI>Mapp:</HI> As for the great <HI>River</HI> of <HI>Darian,</HI> it is situated something to the <HI>East∣ward</HI> ot the <HI>Golden Island.</HI></P>
<P>The golden Island is but a small place, not much bigger than <HI>Inch-Keith</HI> in the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Forth.</HI></P>
<P>There are a great many Islands westward from the golden Island 14. <HI>Leagues</HI> called <HI>Zanblas</HI> Islands.</P>
<P>The Situation of our <HI>Fort</HI> does ly very conveniently, ha∣ving a <HI>Bay</HI> upon the <HI>West,</HI> with many small <HI>Rocks,</HI> which make it inaccessable; On the <HI>East,</HI> the great River of <HI>Darian.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Soil</HI> is as good here, as in any other place in <HI>America;</HI> up the Country there are long Ranges of <HI>Mountains,</HI> well cloathed with <HI>Trees,</HI> which for the most part are <HI>Palm,</HI> and <HI>Yellow-Sanders;</HI> The Inhabitants call it <HI>Bois de Chandle,</HI> or in English <HI>Candle-Wood;</HI> It burns like a Candle, and serves them with Light while they fish in the Night time. Here grows also <HI>Lignum sanctum,</HI> or <HI>Guiacum,</HI> its Virtues are very well known, more especially to those who observe not well the VII. Commandment, and are giv'n to impure Copula∣tions; Physicians drawing hence in severall Compositions the greatest Antidote against all venerall Deseases, as also for cold and vitious Humors.</P>
<P>The Tree likewise that affords <HI>Gummi Elemi</HI> grows here in great Aboundance; As doth <HI>Radix Chinae,</HI> or <HI>China-Root;</HI></P>
<P>There is a <HI>Prickle Palm,</HI> so call'd because it is infinitly full of <HI>Prickles</HI> from the <HI>Root</HI> to the <HI>Leaves;</HI> with these Prickles the <HI>Indians</HI> use to torment the Prisoners they take in Battle, they tye them to a Tree, then takeing these Thorns they put them into little Pellets of Cotton dipt in Oil, and stick them
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>in the Sides of the miserable prisoners, as thick as the Bri∣stles of an <HI>Hedg-Hogg:</HI> which cause an incredible Torment to the Patient; Then they set them a Fire, and if the tor∣mented Prisoner sing in the Midst of his Torments: He is e∣steem'd a couragious Soldier, who neither fears his Enemies nor the Torture; But if on the contrary, He cry out, they e∣steem him a Coward, and unworthy of any Memory. This Custom was told me by an <HI>Indian,</HI> who said He had used his Enemy thus, oftentimes. But to return to the <HI>Prickle-Palm,</HI> I shall only tell you that these Palm Trees in this only differ from the ordinary <HI>Palms,</HI> The <HI>Leaves</HI> are like these of other <HI>Palm</HI> Trees, only a little bigger, and rounder, and full of little <HI>Kernels,</HI> as pleaseing to the Taste as the <HI>Walnuts</HI> in <HI>Europe.</HI> The <HI>Wine-Palm</HI> is so call'd from the Aboundance of Wine gathered from it, of an extraordinary Shape or Form for from the <HI>Root</HI> up half Way, it is only three or four In∣ches thick; but upward, something above two thirds of its Height; It is as big, and as thick, as an ordinary Bucket, &amp; within it is full of a certain Matter very like a slender Stock of white <HI>Cabbage,</HI> which is a very juicy of a Liquor much pleasing to the Palate; This Liquor after Fermentation and Settling of the Grounds, becomes very good and clear Wine.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fruit</HI> is much like to that of other <HI>Palms,</HI> but smaller, like <HI>Cherries;</HI> To write farther of the Trees, it would fill a great many Sheets; But I will only name them: <HI>Palm a Chapelet,</HI> or <HI>Rosary-Palm,</HI> so called by the <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>Spa∣niards; Caremit-Tree,</HI> very like our <HI>Pear-Tree,</HI> very pleasing to the Taste; <HI>Genpa-Trees,</HI> like to our <HI>Cherry Trees;</HI> besides these, there are diverse other Sorts of Trees, as <HI>Cedars</HI> in great Aboundance, which this Part of the World produces; They are very usefull for building Ships and Canoa's, These <HI>Ca∣noa's</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>are like little Ferry-Boats, being made only of one Tree hollowed, and fitted, for the Sea: They are so swift, that they may be called <HI>Neptun</HI>'s <HI>POST-HORSES.</HI> The <HI>In∣dians</HI> make these <HI>Canoa's</HI> without any Iron Instruments, by only burning the Trees nigh the Root, and then so govern∣ing the fire, as nothing is burnt more than what they would have; Some have <HI>Hatches</HI> of <HI>Flint</HI> wherewith they scrape or pare off whatsoever are burnt too far, and these by fire only they give that shape which renders them capable of naviga∣ting 60. or 80. <HI>Leagues</HI> with ordinary Security. Here is <HI>Ba∣sile-Wood, Yaco</HI> is another Sort of Tree; Here are a great ma∣ny <HI>Cabbage-Trees,</HI> the <HI>Cabbage</HI> growing on the Top of it. Here grows the <HI>Coco-Nut,</HI> of which the <HI>Chacolat</HI> is made. Here grows the <HI>Pinn-Apple,</HI> and a great dale of <HI>Plantine,</HI> or <HI>Sugar-Canes,</HI> of which they make <HI>Sugar;</HI> And a great dale of other Trees, which being too tedious to give you an Account of, I forbear; You may have any <HI>Trees, Roots,</HI> or <HI>Herbs,</HI> that grow in <HI>Europe</HI> as well as others that will not grow there, as <HI>Mammi; &amp;c.</HI> You may have a great dale of <HI>Tobacco</HI> if you plant, much better than in any Place to the Northward.</P>
<P>I shall give you an Account of the makeing <HI>Sugar</HI> &amp; <HI>Indigo</HI> in another place.</P>
<P><HI>Flies</HI> as Insects severall Sorts of them, these are as big as Horse-Flies in <HI>Enrepe,</HI> and denting themselves upon Mens Bo∣dys, stick and suck the Blood till they can no longer fly, which obliges the Inhabitants to wear continually Branches of Trees to Fan them away; There are a great dale of other Sorts, as <HI>Cochinilla</HI>'s; There are monstruous <HI>Adders</HI> which are very frequent in these Places, upon which Account I durst neverly on the Grass; Here are very good Land <HI>Tortoises,</HI> which are very good meat; There are also <HI>Crocodiles,</HI> I could tell you, a good true story about One of them, but being too tedious I forbear.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>
<P>There is a great dale of <HI>Doggs, Deer, Rabbets,</HI> and <HI>Monkeys,</HI> and many other Sorts of Quadrupeds, which Ye have not the like of in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>You have a great dale of all Sorts of Fowls many wherof do not breed in <HI>Europe,</HI> as <HI>Parrots;</HI> They make their Nests in Holes of <HI>Palmito</HI> Trees, which Holes are before made by other Birds, for they are not capable of excavating any wood tho' never so soft, having their own Bills too crooked and blunt; Hence provident Nature hath supplyed them with the Labour of other Birds called <HI>Carpenteros,</HI> or <HI>Carpinters;</HI> These are no bigger than <HI>Sparrows:</HI> Yet having such hard and pierce∣ing Bills, that no Iron Instrument can be made fitter to ex∣cavate any Tree, though never so solid, and hard; And these Holes the Parrots getting Possession of build their Nests.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Pigeons</HI> of all Sorts we are aboundantly provided; There is another small Bird here called <HI>Cabreros,</HI> or <HI>Goat-Keepers,</HI> and chiefly feed upon <HI>Crabs</HI> of the <HI>Sea;</HI> In these Birds are seaven distinct <HI>Bladders</HI> of <HI>Gall,</HI> and their Flesh is as bitter as <HI>Aloes:</HI> Of these We have aboundance.</P>
<P>There are very many <HI>Crows,</HI> or <HI>Ravens,</HI> more trouble<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome, than usefull, who make a most hideous Noise.</P>
<P>We have several fruits &amp; roots very usefull, as <HI>Potat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> they dres them only by well boiling them in a Kettle, with fair clean water; Then we cover them with a Cloath for half an Hour where they become as soft as boiled <HI>Chesnuts;</HI> Of the said <HI>Pa∣tates</HI> we make a Drink called <HI>Maiz:</HI> They cut them into small slices, and cover them with hot water; when they are well imbibed they press them through a course Cloath, and the <HI>Liquor</HI> that comes throgh tho something thick they keep in Vessels made for that Purpose; Hereafter settling two or three Days, it works: And having thrown off its <HI>Lees,</HI> is
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>fit for Drink They use with great Delight, and tho' it be somewhat four: Yet it is very pleasant, substantial, and ex∣traordinary wholsome; The Invention of this is wholly owing to the <HI>Indians,</HI> as well as many other things found out for the Preservation of Mans Life.</P>
<P>There is a Root called by the Indians <HI>Cazave</HI> of which they make a Liquor called <HI>Vey-Con</HI> much like unto <HI>Beer.</HI></P>
<P>Another Fruit called <HI>Bananas,</HI> is an excellent Liquor, which in Strength, and Pleasantness of Tast, may be compa∣red to the best Wines of <HI>Spain:</HI> But this Liquor easily cau∣ses Drunkenness.</P>
<P>VVe begin now to plant <HI>Tobacco</HI> for Trade; The Manner whereof is this: VVe make Bedds of Earth 12. Foot square, these thay cover with <HI>Palmito</HI> Leaves, that the Rays of the <HI>Sun</HI> may not reach the Earth; Then we water them when it doth not rain, as we do our Gardens in <HI>Europe;</HI> Being grown about the Bigness of young <HI>Lettuce:</HI> we transplant it into streight Lines in spacious Fields, setting every Plant 3. Foot distant from each other; The <HI>Tobacco</HI> must be weeded very carefully: seing the least Root of any other Herb comeing near it hinders its Grouth.</P>
<P>There is a sort of Fish which the <HI>Indians</HI> many times eat of it is much like unto a <HI>Cow,</HI> because its Head, Nose, and Teeth, are very like to them; They are found commonly where under the Depth of the waters its full of Grass, in w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ich its thought they feed; They have no Ears, but in place of them two little Holes, as wide as ones little finger; Near the Neck thy have two Finns, under which are two Uders like the Breast of a VVoman; The Skin is very closs, this Skin on the Back is two finger thick which being dryed is as hard as whalebone, and may serve to make walking staffs
<PB N="9" REF="5"/>the Belly is in all things like that of a <HI>Cow,</HI> as far as the <HI>Reins;</HI> their manner of engendring is the same with that of a land Cow, the Male being every way like that of a <HI>Bull;</HI> they conceave and breed but once, but what Time they go with <HI>Calf,</HI> I could learn; These Fishes have a very acute Sense of <HI>Hearing,</HI> so as in takeing them the fisher-men make∣ing not the least Noise do not row unless very slightly, for this reason they use certain Instruments for Rowing, by the <HI>Indians</HI> called <HI>Pagayos</HI> with which they row without any Noise to fright the fish while they are a fishing they speak not one to another only make signs, they dart them with Javelins having two Hooks at the End; These fish are ordinarly from 20 to 24 Foot long; Their Flesh is good to eat, being in like in colour to that of a land Cow, but in taste to Pork It hath much <HI>Fat,</HI> or <HI>Grease,</HI> which We make Oil of.</P>
<P>We have also another fish called <HI>Tortoise,</HI> of an indiffe∣rent Bigness, and of a green Colour, their Scales are some∣what hard, and of a very pleasant Taste; There is another Sort somewhat smaller; this Sort commonly keep themselves among the Rocks, whence they crawl out for Food, which is generally <HI>Sea-Apples;</HI> These other above mentioned, feed on <HI>Grass,</HI> which grows in the Water on the sandy Banks; Their Eggs are almost like these of a <HI>Crocodile,</HI> but without any <HI>shell,</HI> being only covered with a thin <HI>film;</HI> They are found in such prodigious Quantitys along the shore, that were they not frequently destroy'd by Birds, the Seas would abound with <HI>Tortoises.</HI></P>
<P>The Way and Manner of fishing them is as follows; <HI>viz.</HI> by makeing a great Nail, or Kind of Dart; this they fix at the End of a long Pole, with which they kill the <HI>Tortoi∣ses</HI> whenever they appear above Water.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="6"/>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> for the most part are very dextrous in takeing these <HI>Tortoises.</HI></P>
<P>I will give you an Account of our shooting of some <HI>Mon∣keys,</HI> and <HI>Birds</HI> called <HI>Pheasants;</HI> The Toil of shooting did seem, at least to me, to be sufficiently compensated with the Pleasure of killing the <HI>Monkeys,</HI> for at these We made ordi∣narly 15 or 16 shot before We could kill three or four, so nimbly would they escape our Hands, and aim even after be∣ing much wounded; On the other side it was a Diversion to see the femal Monkeys carry their little Ones on their backs when any Person passed under the Trees-where these Monkeys are sitting; They will commonly squirt their Excrements u∣pon our Heads and Cloaths; likewise if shooting at any, one happen to be wounded, the rest flock about him, and do lay their Paws upon the Wound to hinder the blood from issuing forth, others gather <HI>Moss</HI> from the Trees and thrust into the Wound, and hereby stop the Blood; At other times they gather such or such <HI>Herbs,</HI> and cheuing them in their Mouth apply as Poultties, all which caused in Me great Admiration, seing such strange Actions in these irrational Creatures, which testified the fidelity and love they had for one another.</P>
<P>I shall give you an Account, by the way, of the <HI>People;</HI> I have learned to speak somewhat of the <HI>Language</HI> by One of them them who can speak tolerable good <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>I enquir'd into their <HI>Customs, Lives,</HI> and <HI>Policy:</HI> whereof I give you this Account; They are governed by a King, and severall Princes: they have generally a great Hatred a∣gainst the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> There are a great many persons of them; they are very courtious to any that give them any thing. Here are two Sorts of People of them: The one Sort cultivates the Ground, and make Plantations; these are most numerous,
<PB N="11" REF="6"/>the other is a lazy sort, never seen but at Night: They have <HI>Hutts</HI> that they live in all Day, till Night; they not care∣ing for any other Habitation</P>
<P>They use no other Cloaths than an <HI>Apron</HI> ty'd to their Middle, comeing down so as to hide their <HI>Privitys;</HI> such Aprons are made of the <HI>Rinds</HI> of <HI>Trees,</HI> which they strongly beat upon <HI>Stones</HI> till they are sofned; The same they use for <HI>Bed-Cloaths,</HI> except a few who make them of <HI>Cotton,</HI> they are whiter than the whitest in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The other is of a <HI>Brownish</HI> Colour, but very handsome Bodys of <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Women</HI> tightly limb'd, the Men of them are verie dextruous at <HI>Bow</HI> and <HI>Arrow,</HI> and very good <HI>spears</HI> the common Sort use spears of <HI>Timber,</HI> the points are shod with <HI>Iron,</HI> or <HI>teeth</HI> of <HI>Crocodiles.</HI> They are most dextruous in <HI>Swimming,</HI> I did never see the like of them in <HI>Doucking</HI> for they will continue near half an Hour below the <HI>Wa∣ter.</HI></P>
<P>I could never learn what <HI>Religion</HI> they have, all I could learn was they neither believe in, nor serve the <HI>Devil:</HI> as many other Nations in <HI>America,</HI> do; Hereby they are not so much tormented by him as other Nations are. They are ve∣ry attentive at our Form of <HI>Worship;</HI> they did tell me they did not like <HI>Spaniards</HI> Religion, for they are as ill as those that worship the <HI>Devil,</HI> for that Religion can not be good which is so cruel.</P>
<P>Their ordinary Food consists in severall <HI>Fruits,</HI> a little in∣dian <HI>Corn;</HI> Fruits, such as <HI>Bananas, Racoves, Ananas, Pota∣tos, Cazave;</HI> As also <HI>Crabs,</HI> and severall <HI>Fish,</HI> which they kill in the fea with <HI>Darts,</HI> which they are wonderfully dex∣truous at.</P>
<P>They are pretty expert in makeing certain pleasant and de∣licat
<PB N="12" REF="7"/><HI>Liquors;</HI> The commonest among them is called <HI>Achioc,</HI> this is made of a certain <HI>Seed</HI> of <HI>Palm-tree,</HI> bruised and steept in hot water, till it be settled at the Bottom. This Liquor being strain,d off, hath a pleasant <HI>ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> and is very nourish∣ing. Other sorts of liquors they prepare, which I shall omit for brevity; only I'll say something of that made of <HI>Platanos</HI> These they knead hot with water, and then put into great <HI>Calabashes,</HI> full of cold water for eight Days, during which it ferments as well as the best wine. This Liquor they drink for Pleasure, and as a great Regale, so that when they invite any of their Friends, or Relations, they cannot treat them better than with this pleasant Drink.</P>
<P>They are very unskilful in dressing Victuals; so that they very seldom treat one another with Banquets. But when they invite others they desire them to come and drink of their Liquors. Before the invited Persons come to their House, those that expect them, comb their Hair verie well, and anoint their Faces with the Oil of <HI>Palm,</HI> mixt with a black Tincture which renders them very hideous, The women, also dawb their Faces with another Sort of Stuff, which makes them look is red as <HI>Crimson.</HI> And such are their greatest Orna∣ment, and Attire, Then He that invites, takes his Arms, which are three or four <HI>Azagayas,</HI> and goes out his <HI>Cottage</HI> 3 or 400 Steps, to wait for, and receive the invited persons. As soon as they draw nigh, he falls down on the Ground, lying flat on his Face, without any Motion, as if he were dead; being thus prostrat, the invited Friends take him up, and set him on his Feet, and go altogether to the <HI>Hutt.</HI> Here the Persons invited, use the same Ceremony falling down to the Ground, as the Inviter did before. But he lifts them up one by one, and giving them his Hand, conducts them into his
<PB N="13" REF="7"/>Cottage, where he causes them to sit. The VVomen on these Occasions use few, or no Ceremonys.</P>
<P>Being thus brought into the House, they are presented every one with a <HI>Calabash,</HI> of about two <HI>Pynts</HI> of <HI>Scotish</HI> Measure, full of <HI>Achioc</HI> almost as thick as Water-Gruel, or Children-Pap. These they are to drink off, and get down at any Rate.</P>
<P>These Calabashes being emptied, the Master of the House, with many Ceremonys, goes about the Room, and gathereth his Calabashes. And this Drinking hitherto is reckon'd but one Wellcome. Afterwards, they drink of the <HI>Achioch</HI> above mention'd, to which they were invited.</P>
<P>Then follow many Songs and Dances, and 1000 Caresses, to the Women; So that oftentemes, for a Testimony of their great Love, they take their Darts, and with the points, they pierce and wound their genital parts. This I could believe, though often affirmed to me, till my own Eyes were Witt∣nesses of these and the like actions. Neither only on this Oc∣casion do they use this Ceremony of pierceing their Genitals, but also when they make love to any Woman, thereby to let them understand the Greatness of their Affection, and Con∣stancy.</P>
<P>They marry not any young Maid without the Consent of her Paients. If any desires to take a Wife; he is first exa∣mined by the Damsels Father concerning feverall Sorts of good Husbandry. These are commonly, whether He can make <HI>Azagayas,</HI> Darts for fishing; or spin a certain <HI>Thread,</HI> which they use about their Arrows. Having answered to Satisfa∣ction, the Examiner cals to his Daughter, for a little <HI>Caba∣lash</HI> full of <HI>Achioc.</HI> Of this he drinks first; then gives the <HI>Cup</HI> to the young Man; and He to the Bride, who drinks it out and with this only Ceremony the <HI>Marriage</HI> is made. When
<PB N="14" REF="8"/>any one drinks to the Health of another, the second Person is to drink out the Liquor, lest in the <HI>Calabash,</HI> but in Case of Marriage, as was said, it is consum'd only among them three: And the Bride allways obtaining, by far, the greater share.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Woman</HI> lys in, neither She nor her Husband ob∣serve the Time, costomarie among the <HI>Carribes;</HI> But as soon as the VVoman is delevered, she goes to the next <HI>River, Brook</HI> or <HI>Fountain,</HI> and washes the new-born Creature, swathing it up in certain <HI>Rowlers,</HI> or <HI>Swath-Bands,</HI> there call'd <HI>Cabalas.</HI> This done she goes about Her ordinarie Labour. When the <HI>Man</HI> dies, his Wife burys Him with all his <HI>Azagayas, Aprons,</HI> and <HI>Ear-Jewels;</HI> and comes every Day to her Husbands <HI>Grave</HI> bringing Him <HI>Meat,</HI> and <HI>Drink,</HI> for a whole <HI>Year</HI> after.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Years</HI> they reckon by <HI>Moons,</HI> allowing fifteen to e∣very Year, which makes their entire <HI>Circle,</HI> as our twelve <HI>Moneths,</HI> do ours.</P>
<P>Some <HI>Writers</HI> of the <HI>Carribbe-Islands,</HI> affirm, that this <HI>Cere∣mony,</HI> of carrying of <HI>Victuals</HI> to the <HI>Dead,</HI> is generall among them; and that the <HI>Devil</HI> comes to the <HI>Sepulchres,</HI> and carries away the <HI>Meat</HI> and <HI>Drink.</HI> But I know the contrarie, ha∣ving my self taken away these <HI>Offerings,</HI> and eaten them; for I knew that the <HI>Fruits</HI> used on these <HI>Occasions,</HI> were of the choicest, and the <HI>Liquors</HI> of the best Sort. The Widow ha∣ving compleated her <HI>Year,</HI> opens the <HI>Grave,</HI> and takes out all her Husbands <HI>Bones;</HI> These she scrapes, and washes very well &amp; puts them in a <HI>Cabala,</HI> or <HI>Satchel,</HI> &amp; is obliged for another <HI>year</HI> to carry them upon her Back all <HI>Day,</HI> and to sleep upon them all <HI>Night,</HI> till the <HI>Year</HI> be out. Then she hangs up the <HI>Bagg</HI> and <HI>Bones,</HI> against the <HI>Pest</HI> of her own <HI>Door,</HI> if she be a <HI>Mi∣stresse</HI> of an <HI>House,</HI> if not she hangs them at the <HI>Door</HI> of her
<PB N="15" REF="8"/>next Neighbour, or Relations.</P>
<P>The <HI>Widows</HI> cannot marrie the second time, according to their Customs, till after two <HI>Years</HI> End; the <HI>Men</HI> are bound to perform no such <HI>Ceremonys</HI> for their <HI>Wives;</HI> But if anie <HI>Pirrat</HI> marrie an <HI>indian</HI> Woman, she is bound to do in all things as if he were an <HI>Indian.</HI></P>
<P>I shall proceed now to give you an Account of the <HI>Men, Women,</HI> and their <HI>Habits;</HI></P>
<P>They wear as an <HI>Ornament</HI> in their <HI>Noses,</HI> a <HI>Gold,</HI> or <HI>Sil∣ver-Plate,</HI> in <HI>Form</HI> of an <HI>Half-Moon;</HI> which when they drink, they hold up with one <HI>Hand,</HI> while they lift up the <HI>Cup</HI> with the other. The <HI>Men</HI> paint themselves sometimes with <HI>Streaks</HI> of <HI>Black,</HI> and the <HI>Women</HI> with <HI>Red.</HI> The <HI>Wo∣men</HI> have in their <HI>Noses</HI> a pretty thick <HI>Ring</HI> of <HI>Gold</HI> or <HI>Silver</HI> and cover themselves with a <HI>Blanket</HI> only. They are general∣ly well featured: Among whom I saw severall fairer than the fairest in <HI>Europe,</HI> with <HI>Hair</HI> as white as the finest <HI>Flax.</HI> 'Tis reported of them, that they see better in the Dark, than in the Light.</P>
<P>I shall further give You an Account of our going up the country to their <HI>King</HI> or chief <HI>Captain;</HI> we marching from our <HI>Fort</HI> with Captain <HI>Andraeas,</HI> and other of their <HI>Princes:</HI> We began our March towards their head Place, where their <HI>King</HI> resided, first through a small Skirt of a <HI>Wood,</HI> and then over a <HI>Bay</HI> almost three <HI>Miles,</HI> or a <HI>League</HI> in Length. After that We went about six or seaven <HI>Miles</HI> up a woody <HI>Valley,</HI> and We saw here and there some old <HI>Plantation,</HI> and had a very good Path to march in. There we came to the side of a <HI>Ri∣ver,</HI> which in most places was dry, and built Us <HI>Houses,</HI> or rather <HI>Hutts,</HI> to lodge in.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> forbad us to ly upon the <HI>Grass,</HI> for Fear of
<PB N="16" REF="9"/>monstruous <HI>Adders,</HI> which are very fiequent in those places.</P>
<P>Breakeing some of the <HI>Stones</HI> that lay in the <HI>River,</HI> We found them shine with <HI>Sparks</HI> of <HI>Gold;</HI> These Stones were driven down from the neighbouring <HI>Mountains</HI> in Time of <HI>Floods.</HI></P>
<P>The next day of our March We mounted a very steep <HI>Hill,</HI> and on the other side, at the <HI>Foot</HI> thereof, We rested on the <HI>Bank</HI> of a <HI>River,</HI> which Captain <HI>Andraeas</HI> told us, ran into South <HI>Sea,</HI> being the same River on which the Town of <HI>Santa Maria</HI> was situated. Hence We continued our March till a∣bout <HI>Noon,</HI> and then ascended another Mountain, far high∣er than the former; Here We were often, and in many pla∣ces in great Danger, the Mountain being so nigh to a <HI>Per∣pendicular,</HI> and the <HI>Path</HI> so narrow, that but one Man at a Time could pass, We arrived in the <HI>Evening</HI> on the other Side of ihe Mountain, and lodg'd again by the Side of the same River.</P>
<P>Next <HI>Morning,</HI> We march'd all along the River aforemen∣tion'd, crossing it often, almost at ev'ry half Mile, sometimes up to the <HI>Knees,</HI> and at other times up to the Middle, in a very rapid current. About Noon we came to a place, where we found some <HI>Indian</HI> Houses. These were very large, and neat: The sides were built of <HI>Cabbage</HI>-Trees, and the Roofs of wild: <HI>Canes,</HI> thatch'd with <HI>Palmito-Royal;</HI> They had ma∣ny Partitions, or distinct Ground-Roomes, but no Ascent by <HI>Stairs.</HI> At this place were four of these Houses together, all within a Stone's throw of one another, each of them have∣ing a large <HI>Plantan</HI> Walk before it. Half a Mile from this place, liv'd the <HI>King,</HI> or chief <HI>Captain</HI> of the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Da∣rian</HI> whe came to visit Us in Royal <HI>Robes,</HI> with his <HI>Queen.</HI> and <HI>Family.</HI> His <HI>Crown</HI> was made of small white <HI>Reeds</HI> cu∣riously
<PB N="17" REF="9"/>woven, having no other <HI>Top</HI> than its lineing, which was red <HI>Silk.</HI> Round about the middle of it was a thin plate of <HI>Gold,</HI> about two Inches broad, lac'd behind, in which stuck two or three <HI>Ostrich</HI> Feathers. About this Plate went also a Row of golden Beads, which were bigger than ordinar <HI>Pease;</HI> underneath which was seen the red lining of the <HI>Crown.</HI> In his Nose he wore a large Plate of Gold, in Form of an half-<HI>Moon;</HI> and in each Ear a great gold Ring, nigh four Inches diameter with a round thin plate of Gold of the same Breadth, having an small Hole in the Center, by which it hung to the Ring. He was covered with a thin white <HI>Col∣ton</HI> Robe, reaching to the small of his <HI>Leggs,</HI> and round its Bottom a Frienge of the same, three Inches deep; so that by reason of the length of this Robe, We could see no farther than his naked <HI>Anckles.</HI> In his Hand He had a long bright <HI>Lance</HI> as sharp as any Knife. With Him He had three Sons each of them having a white Robe, and their Lances in their Hands, but standing bare-headed before Him; as also did eight or nine Per ons more of his Retinue, or Guard.</P>
<P>His <HI>Queen</HI> wore a red <HI>Blanket,</HI> which was closly girt a∣bout her <HI>wast,</HI> and another that came losely over her head and shoulders. She had a young child in her Arms, &amp; two Daugh∣ters walked by her, with their Faces almost covered with stripps, or streaks of red, and about their Necks, and Armes almost loaden with small Beads of severall Colours. These <HI>Indian</HI> Women of <HI>Darian,</HI> are generally very free, airy, &amp; brisk; yet withall very modest, and cautious in their Hus∣bands Presence, of whose Jealousie they stand in Fear. With these <HI>Indians</HI> We made an Exchainge, or had a Truck, as it is called, for <HI>Knives, Pins, Needles,</HI> or any such-like Tri∣fles; but in our Dealing with them we found them to be very cunning.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="10"/>
<P>He gave Us a Calabash full of Liquor which they make of <HI>Plantans;</HI> This sort of Fruit is first reduced to <HI>Mash,</HI> then laid betwixt Leaves of the same Tree, and so used with Wa∣rer. After which Preparation, they call it <HI>Miscelaw.</HI> On our March hither We found in our Way, here, and there, an House or two, whose Owners commonly stood at the door and gave, as we Passed by, to every one of Us, either a ripe <HI>Plantan,</HI> or else a <HI>Cazave,</HI> or some other sweet and pleasant <HI>Root.</HI></P>
<P>This Captaine or King, is the head of their other Captains when they go to Battle against the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> somewhat to the South-ward of this Place is a pleasant <HI>Plain,</HI> the generall. Place the <HI>Indians</HI> rendez-vous in.</P>
<P>I shall now give You an Account of the rest of their <HI>Cap∣tains.</HI></P>
<P>Captain <HI>Ambrosio</HI> commands from the River <HI>Pinas, Bono∣nos, Mango,</HI> and <HI>Cocos,</HI> to the <HI>Samblas,</HI> He is a Man above sixty, but strong and vigorous, a mortall Enemy to the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI> with whom He has had long <HI>War;</HI> He is esteem'd the bravest, and most succesfull of all their Commanders on every Occasion; He's of a middle Size, well made, strongly limb'd, and of a grave, and somewhat stern Countenance.</P>
<P>He has a Son in law, one <HI>Pedro,</HI> a brisk little Fellow who speaks good <HI>Spanish,</HI> haveing been a Slave to them at <HI>Panama</HI> for severall Years, and who can never forget, nor forgive, their Usage of him there.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Diego</HI> commands from the Bottom of the Gulph of <HI>Ʋraba</HI> on this side to <HI>Caret</HI>-Bay, and has about 3000. Men under his Command; He is esteem'd the most powerfull a∣mongst them, and has been at War with the <HI>Spaniard</HI> about
<PB N="19" REF="10"/>a twelve Month. The Occasion was this: The <HI>Indians</HI> ha∣veing found three Gold Mines within his Jurisdiction, being two small ones, and a very great Vein, consulted with them∣selves what to do; And being sensible that they did not understand how to work them, concluded to discover them to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> provided they'd allow them such a share of the Profit. This was agreed to, and faithfully promised by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> but no sooner had the <HI>Indians</HI> shew'd the <HI>Mines</HI> but they shut up two of them, and put strong guards upon them, and fell to work upon the third, of which the <HI>Indians</HI> demanding their share, they beat and abused them, calling them their Slaves, and threatned to exterminat them, which provock'd them so, that a little time after, they siez'd upon 20. <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and 3. <HI>Priests,</HI> and cut them all to pieces.</P>
<P>The next to <HI>Diego,</HI> is one Captain <HI>Powsigo</HI> of <HI>Caret</HI>-Bay, He is one of the <HI>Indian</HI> Clergy-Men, and commands that Part of the Coast which lyes between <HI>Caret</HI>-Bay, and golden Island; He is but a small Captain; and Brother in Law to <HI>Andraeas.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Peninsulae</HI> which we possess, and which we found un∣inhabited (nor has it ever been by any heretofore, that we have yet hear'd of,) lys betwixt his Bounds, and Captain <HI>Andraeas</HI>'s.</P>
<P>From <HI>Golden-Island,</HI> to the River <HI>Pinas;</HI> about a <HI>League</HI> to the <HI>West-ward</HI> of the <HI>Isle</HI> of <HI>Pinas, Andraeas,</HI> and his Brother <HI>Pedro</HI> command, they are greater than <HI>Powsigo,</HI> but not so powerfull as <HI>Diego;</HI> yet their united Interests by Consan∣guinity, together with the Vicinity of their Commands to our Settlement, makes their Friendship of much greater Conse∣quence.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="11"/>
<P>These People have had a good Correspondence, for seve∣rall <HI>Years</HI> past, with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and have suffered some of them to reside among 'em to give an Account by Land to <HI>Panama,</HI> from time to time, who were upon this Coast about two months before our Arrivall here.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Ambrosio,</HI> who has the adjoyning Command, for∣ced them to enter into the common Confederacy, and cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t off ten <HI>Spaniards</HI> who lived on the <HI>Main</HI> of the golden-Island, I distinguish it thus, by reason the Natives call all the <HI>Main</HI> opposite to the Island, by the same Name that it bears. A∣bout a League from the Water side there is an high Moun∣tain wherein they assure Us are severall <HI>Mines</HI> of excellent <HI>Gold.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> are very sensible of this, and from time to time have taken great Care by fair or soul Means, ne∣ver to let them be opned, well knowing that (being so near the <HI>North-sea</HI>) they should have the least share of them to themselvs.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Andraeas</HI> has often been at <HI>Panama,</HI> the <HI>Mines</HI> of <HI>Sauta Maria,</HI> and the <HI>South-Sea;</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> believeing he might be usefull to them, made Him a Captain, by giveing Him a stick tip't with Silver, upon which He values himself above others, and that has (we are apt to believe) endeared Him to their Interests; yet the Love of ones Country, and Liberty is so naturall, that we have good Reason to believe that as soon (being a sensible cunning Fellow) as He finds we are able to protect Him, he will heartily join to our In∣terest.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Pedro</HI> is esteemed by <HI>Ambrosio,</HI> and all his People whose Daughter he has to VVife, as also two of her Daugh∣ters by himself, which is allowed here, yet it seems that they believe it a Crime, since if they have any children during the
<PB N="21" REF="11"/>Life of their mother, they are buried alive, (I mean the child ren) which is very strange, that the innocent should suffer for the guilty.</P>
<P>They prest Us very hard to come and live by them, as also joyntly to make war with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whom they would engage upon the Forfaulture of their Heads, if we would as∣sist them with an hundered arm'd Men, and as many Arms, with 2000. of their own People, to drive. not only out of the <HI>Mines,</HI> (which are but three Days Journey from this Place,) but even out of <HI>Panama</HI> it self. VVe gave them fair words, and promised to go to the <HI>West-ward</HI> with them to vieu the Coasts, and if there were any convenienter Harbour for our ships, we would be their Neighbours.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sanblaz</HI> to the River <HI>Conception,</HI> is commanded by one <HI>Corbet.</HI></P>
<P>Next to <HI>Corbet</HI> from the River <HI>Conception,</HI> is one <HI>Nicola,</HI> a Man who speaks <HI>Spanish</HI> as well as any naturall <HI>Spaniard,</HI> ha∣ving been for about a dozen of Years of his Youth among them; He likewise reads and writes it perfectly, and under∣stands the State of <HI>Europe</HI> very well: which none other of them have any Notion of; He is said to be wise and extrem∣ly beloved by his People, for his Justice, and good Nature, in so much that there has been Designs to cut off <HI>Ambrosio,</HI> and place Him in his Room, for He is of a rough military temper, and often upon slight pretinces makes bold to take away what they have from them; However if they do not love him, they fear him, and his near Alliance, and strick Friendship with <HI>Diego</HI> in the Gulph, a powerfull, and gal∣lant old Fellow, renders Him very secure.</P>
<P>This <HI>Nicola</HI> was in good Terms with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> till a∣bout a twelve Month agoe, a Triffle made Him brake with them: and 'twas this;</P>
<PB N="22" REF="12"/>
<P>He had got an excellent French <HI>Fuzie</HI> from a <HI>Buccanier,</HI> which He valu'd extremly: 'Twas somewhat out of Order, nor did He know how to right it again; A Spanish <HI>Don</HI> from <HI>Porto-Bello</HI> being at his House, told him he would car∣ry it with Him, and get it mended for Him, which the o∣ther consenting to, with a Desire it might be return'd as soon as possible, They parted. The <HI>Don</HI> shew'd it to the Gover∣nour, who liked it extremly, and said 'twas too good for an Heathen; So ordered an old rusty <HI>Match-Lock</HI> to be sent in Lieu. This He took so hainously, that He fell upon the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> wherever He sound 'em, and cut them off, neither is He to be reconsil'd to them.</P>
<P><HI>Ambrosio</HI> who all the rest allow to be the most dareing, and brave, as also the most faithful to his Promise; being a true Friend, and a most inveterat Enemy to the <HI>Spaniards:</HI> keeps Him within Bounds.</P>
<P>From the mouth of the River <HI>Coco,</HI> about a good League We went to <HI>Ambrosio</HI>'s House, it standing upon the Bank of this River, with about ten or a Dozen lesser Houses about it. When We came near, <HI>Ambrosio</HI> advanc'd about fifty Paces, with twenty Followers, all cloath'd in white loose <HI>Frocks,</HI> with <HI>Frienges</HI> round the Bottom, and <HI>Lances</HI> in their Hands.</P>
<P>He saluted Us kindly, and gave Us a Calabash full of Li∣quor almost like <HI>Lambs-Wool,</HI> which they call <HI>Mishlow,</HI> be∣ing made of Indian <HI>Corn,</HI> and <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tatoes.</HI> This they get drink withall often; Before the house, about twenty Paces it was very smooth and clean. The house was about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0. Foot in Length, 35. in Breadth, and 30. in Height. I was curi∣ovsly thatch'd with <HI>Palmetto-Royal,</HI> and over that <HI>Cajan</HI> Leavs, The <HI>Floor</HI> was of a firm <HI>Earth,</HI> like <HI>Tarras,</HI> very smooth, and
<PB N="23" REF="12"/>clean. The <HI>Sides</HI> were of large <HI>Canes,</HI> about the Bigness of a Mans Legg, and near an <HI>Inch</HI> asunder.</P>
<P>In this House live <HI>Ambrosio,</HI> and <HI>Pedro</HI> with their whole Familys, in all about 40. Persons.</P>
<P>There was an old Woman who cook'd their Victuals for them, and was very stirring about the House; She seem'd to Us to be near sixty. (and was <HI>Ambaosio</HI>'s Grand-Mother) but upon asking Her Age, We were in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orm'd She was an hun∣dred and twenty; We could not believe it, and were per∣suaded they must mistake in the Computation of Time: but as an infallible Demonstration, they shew'd to Us the sixth Generation of this Womans Body in the House, which was indeed very surpriseing; And we were assured 'twas common amongst them to live 150. or 60. Years; Yea 'tis observed those of them who converse often with the <HI>Europeaus,</HI> &amp; drink their strong Liquors, are short liv'd</P>
<P>While We stay'd there, <HI>Ambrosio,</HI> and <HI>Pedro</HI> went out with their <HI>Guns</HI> to kill some <HI>Fowl</HI> for Us; <HI>Pedro</HI> return'd with some <HI>Partridges,</HI> the largest, and best that e're I saw, be∣ing bigger than our <HI>Capons,</HI> and exceeding sweet.</P>
<P>On <HI>November</HI> 30. Captain <HI>Andraeas</HI> came a-board the St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> We waiting an Oportunity of clearing some Suspicions We had of his Correspondence with the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> We taxt Him with it, and He ingeniously confest that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had been friendly to Him, and had made Him a <HI>Captain;</HI> that He was obliged for his Safty to keep fair with them, They assureing Him We were nothing but <HI>Privateers,</HI> who had no Design to settle, but to plunder both <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> and be gone in two or three Months time, as they used to do, and if so, if He assisted Us in any Measure,
<PB N="24" REF="13"/>as soon as We were gone, they'd destroy both Him, and His.</P>
<P>VVe gave Him all possible Assurances of the Contrary, so that He was fully satisfied, and desired we would give Him a <HI>Commission,</HI> and receave Him, and his People into our Prote∣ction; which if we did, He'd give Us all his Right to his part of the Country. VVhereupon a <HI>Commession</HI> was ordered for Capt. <HI>Andraeas,</HI> and being read and approven of, it was delivered to Him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Commission</HI> being read, and rendered <HI>Verbatim</HI> to Him in <HI>Spanish,</HI> He agreed to every <HI>Article:</HI> then before 7 or 8 of his own People, and severall of ours, it was delivered unto Him with a broad basked-hilted <HI>Sword,</HI> and a Pair of <HI>Pistolls,</HI> with which He solemly promised to defend Us to the last <HI>Dropp</HI> of His Blood, against all our Enemys.</P>
<P>Upon Advice of the <HI>K.</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Indisposition, <HI>Count Mon∣tizeuma</HI> Vice-Roy of <HI>Mexico,</HI> born in that Kingdom, and of the Race of these great Emperors, had made such an Interest that 'tis not to be doubted that he will speedily set up for himself.</P>
<P><HI>Carthagean</HI> has likewise been in a civil <HI>War,</HI> which is only covered, not quencht.</P>
<P>At <HI>Porto-Bell</HI> about 700. Slaves got into a Body, which in a little time encreast to above 1500. The Governour not be∣ing able to suppress them, was forced to come to very dis∣honourable Terms, <HI>viz.</HI> to allow them to be a free People, in∣dependent o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and only call'd their Friends.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Powsigo</HI> of <HI>Caret</HI>-Bay, told us of severall <HI>Gold-Mines</HI> within two Miles of us, and shew'd us a <HI>Sample</HI> of the <HI>Gold,</HI> which was extraordinary fine.</P>
