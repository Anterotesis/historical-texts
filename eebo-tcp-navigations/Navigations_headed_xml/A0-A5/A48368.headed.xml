<HEAD>PAROCHIAL QUERIES
In Order to
A Geographical Dictionary, A Natural History, &amp;c. of Wales.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By the Undertaker <HI>E. L.</HI></BYLINE>
<P>HAVING Publish'd some Proposals towards a Survey of <HI>Wales,</HI> and met with
sufficient Encouragement from the Gentry of that Country, and several others,
Lovers of such Studies; to enable me (with God's Permission) to Undertake it:
I thought it necessary for the easier and more effectual Performance of so tedious
a Task, to Print the following <HI>Queries;</HI> having good Grounds to hope the Gen∣try
and Clergy (since they are pleas'd to afford me so Generous an Allowance
towards it) will also readily contribute their Assistance, as to Information; and
the Use of their Manuscripts, Coyns, and other Monuments of Antiquity: The Design being so ex∣traordinary
difficult without such Helps, and so easily improvable thereby. Nor would I have any
imagine, that by Publishing these <HI>Queries,</HI> I design to spare my self the least Labour of Travelling the
Country, but on the contrary be assured, I shall either come my self, or send one of my Assistants
into each Parish throughout <HI>Wales,</HI> and all those in <HI>Shropshire</HI> and <HI>Herefordshire,</HI> where the Lan∣guage
and the Ancient Names of Places are still retain'd: And that with all the Speed, so particular
a Survey will admit of. My Request therefore to such as are desirous of Promoting the Work,
is, That after each <HI>Query,</HI> they would please to write on the blank Paper, (or elsewhere if room be
wanting) their Reports; confining themselves, unless the Subject shall require otherwise, to that Pa∣rish
only where they inhabit; and distinguishing always betwixt Matter of Fact, Conjecture, and
Tradition. Nor will any, I hope, omit such Informations as shall occur to their Thoughts, upon Pre∣sumption,
they can be of little use to the Undertaker, or the Publick, or because they have not leisure
to write down their Observations so regularly as they desire: Seeing that what we sometimes judge
insignificant, may afterwards upon some Application unthought of, appear very useful; and that a
regular and compleat Account of Things is not here so much expected, as short Memorials, and
some Directions in order to a further <HI>Enquiry.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Queries in order to the Geography, and
Antiquities of the Country.</HEAD>
<P>I. FIrst therefore Information is desired of the

any Stones, or other Bodies whatever of a Re∣markable
Figure; the Workmen are desired to
preserve them, till they are call'd for by the Un∣dertaker,
or some of his Friends; in Consideration
whereof, they shall receive some Reward suitable
to their Care and Pains.</P>
<P>XXVII. Such as have made the History of
<HI>Plants</HI> any part of their Diversion, are desired to
communicate dried Specimens of those sorts they
esteem Rarest, or that are unknown to them; or
to give Directions where they may be met with:
Also what Observations they have made by often
repeated Experiments, concerning the <HI>Healing,</HI>
or <HI>Noxious Qualities</HI> of <HI>Plants.</HI></P>
<P>XXVIII. Whether any have been Curious in
observing the various sorts of <HI>Sea-Shells, Sea-Eggs,

Holothuria,</HI> &amp;c. Or have made any Re∣marks
extraordinary on <HI>Land-Insects?</HI></P>
<P>XXIX. Information is desired from those who
have been most conversant in Fishing; what sorts
of <HI>Fish</HI> their Waters afford, and of these which
are the Rarest, or haunt those Places most Sel∣dom?
What Variety of Colours and Shape they
have observ'd in the same Species? What Baits
used for each, and when in Season? What sorts are
Solitary, and which keep together in Shoals?
What they have observ'd as to their Feeding,
Spawning, and Change of Names according to
Age; and by what Tokens they know such, to be
the same Species? Also the <HI>Iaws,</HI> and some of the
<HI>Vertebrae</HI> of the Rarest (for which some Gratuity
shall be allow'd the Fishermen) are desired; in
order to compare them with the <HI>Fossil Bones</HI>
above-mention'd.</P>
<P>XXX. By what is proposed of <HI>Insects</HI> and <HI>Fish;</HI>
the Reader will judge what sort of Information
will be acceptable, relating to <HI>Birds</HI> and <HI>Quadrupeds.</HI></P>
<P>XXXI. Who in each Country is best skill'd in
the <HI>Welsh</HI> Names of <HI>Birds, Fish, Insects, Plants,
Stones;</HI> or any other Natural Bodies?</P>
<P>Having thus propounded what <HI>Queries</HI> occur to my Thoughts; nothing remains, but that I own to
the Publick, that in case this Paper meets with a kind Reception (as from this last Summer's Travels,
I have great Hopes it may) if the Undertaking be ill perform'd, 'twill be wholly my own Fault; the
Gentry of the Country having in all Respects done more than their Part, and afforded such an En∣couragement
towards it, as might sufficiently requite the Labours of a Person far better Qualified
for such a <HI>Design:</HI> But of this, a particular Account (as is necessary) shall be given hereafter. So I
shall only add here; that as to these <HI>Queries,</HI> besides <HI>Wales,</HI> I intreat the favourable Assistance of the
Gentry and Clergy in those other Countries mention'd in the former Proposals: And that in all Places,
they who are dispos'd to further the Design, would please to communicate this Paper where they
think fit, amongst their Neighbours; interpreting some <HI>Queries</HI> to those of the Vulgar, whom they
judge Men of Veracity, and capable of giving any the least Information towards it, that may be
pertinent and instructive.</P>
<P>We judge Mr. <HI>Lhwyd</HI> Qualified for this Undertaking; and that he cannot want proper Materials towards
it, if (as an Addition to his own Industry) he receives such Answers to those <HI>Queries,</HI> as can be conveni∣ently
return'd from each <HI>Parish.</HI></P>
