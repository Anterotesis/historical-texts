<HEAD>THE EPISTLE OF THE French Translator, to all the Protestant Kings, Princes, and Potentates in the Christian World.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Most excellent Princes,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T was my hap to contract amity with cer∣taine Gentlemen of Arragon, and other Spaniards (not Castillians, for to them I wot not how to carry any affection, which should exceede the prescript rule of the Go∣spell) of whom I vnderstood many things t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uching matters of State, which were to me strange and vnknowne: by reason that there were amongst them some personages exceedingly well learned, and most conuersant and expert in all Histories, and notably well seene and pra∣ctised in the affaires of the World. There was one aboue the rest in their company, a man of great spirit iudgement, and experience who had seene a great part of Europe, and (ha∣uing beene for a long time in Portugall) had dealt and con∣uersed with the Portugals, whose Language he spake natu∣rally, and had read all the Histories of that Realme, and was so well acquainted with all their affaires, and knew them all
<PB REF="3"/> so particularly, that I did greatly wonder at it. For, in things that were to come, I found him in manner of a Prophet: in so much that for the viuacity and quicknesse of his spirit, and the long experience which hee hath had, he seemeth to me to haue as great knowledge in things to come, as if he saw them present before his eyes. He made proofe vnto me by many reasons (which did not onely plainely conuince my opi∣nion, but did as it were bind me hand and foote) that these voyages, and others of like kinde, would neuer draw with them any other profit, nor serue to any other purpose, then to waken the sleeping dogge, and to re-enforce the common enemie. Now considering that <HI>Don Philip</HI> King of Castile hath a Councell, the most choise and excellent, such as neuer Prince in this World had a better, his seruitors most loyall and faithfull, great forces, and abundance of treasure, vpon the which all other things doe depend: and yet notwith∣standing all this, hee doth not leaue daily to cause diuers Bookes to be imprinted in his fauour and defence, I doe therefore desire to haue drawne from this learned and wor∣thy person some thing written with his owne hand, which I might present vnto your Maiesties: and to this end did I diuers times make request vnto him, but I could neuer get him to yeeld or condescend thereunto. Wherefore bethink∣ing with my selfe, that as pouerty, griefe, and melancho∣lie, doth bury, and (as it were) kill the spirits of a man, so the commodities of this life, contentment and cheereful∣nesse, doth reuiue and quicken them, I determined because I saw him sad, pensiue, and melancholicke, by reason of his exile and misfortunes out of his owne Countrey, to procure his pleasure and contentment, knowing that by this meanes
<PB REF="3"/> I might obtaine the accomplishment of my desire, I did therefore set open my gates and my House vnto him, I pre∣sented him with my Purse, and made him partner of my Coyne; I cherished and entertained him for many dayes, and (for loue of him) some other of his company. And by this curtesie I made him so beholding to me, that afterwards hauing many times held dispute and conference together, I caused him in the end to take his Pen in hand. Thereupon did he compose in the Castillian Tongue, this Discourse, which he entitled <HI>Trattado paranaetico:</HI> and he presented it vnto me. The which when I had read, a most strange ad∣miration or astonishment did rauish me: for that I neuer saw (I will not say in so little a Volume) but not euen in great Bookes, so many curiosities reported, so many and di∣uers Histories, things so secret and particular, admonish∣ments so necessary to be embraced, nor counsels so iust to be followed. And knowing perfectly the excellency of this worke, and how greatly important it would be to be seene of your Maiesties, and by the Kings, Princes, Potentates, and Common-weales of Europe. And albeit I know my stile to be rude and barbarous, yet such was my ambition (I con∣fesse mine owne infirmity) that I was not willing that any other should haue the pleasure in doing it. In some places I haue augmented it: holding it so to be needfull, for the bet∣ter and more cleere vnderstanding of the History. Touching the originall, I thought it reason not to abridge or cut off any part thereof. I most humbly beseech, in regard of your most Christian Maiesties, to receiue it with that good af∣fection, which Princes oweth to their Subiects: who for his seruice, will not esteeme to hazard the losse of all that hee possesseth: much lesse to make himselfe vncapable for the
<PB REF="4"/> obtaining of that which of right is due vnto him, and who for the good and honour of his Countrey, will spend his life most freely and willingly. God preserue and blesse the most Christian persons of your Maiesties, with so great abun∣dance of spirituall graces, and assist you and make you to prosper with so many riches of temporall blessings, as is possible to his diuine Maiestie. Amen.</P>

<HEAD>The Publisher to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>Riendly Reader, thou hast in this little Pamphlet an incomparable treasure, a rich store-house and magazin full of pre∣cious speeches, true Histories, rare ex∣amples, liuely reasons, and wholsome counsels: the which if their Maiesties, and the Kings, Princes, Potentates, and Common-weales of Christendome would embrace, follow, and put in execution, without doubt they should soone obtaine and find a medicine for so many mischiefes, a remedy for so great and continuall afflictions and intolle∣rable trauels, wherewith their Subiects haue for so many yeeres wrastled and contended. And I dare assure them, that by obseruing the aduise here giuen them, they shall pre∣serue their Estates in time to come from all danger: for euen as the great fishes doe persecute and deuoure the small and little ones; so in like manner those neighbours which are most mighty and puissant, doe despoile and consume the o∣thers who are of lesse puissance. Now we know that there are two especiall reasons for which the Authour hath pro∣longed and drawne out at length this his Discourse, enrich∣ing it with Histories so singular, and beautifying it with such rare authorities and examples. The former is: for that, as he hath endeuoured liuely to depaint vnto vs our enemy, and to make vs know the naturall disposion of those Nati∣ons, of whom we haue great cause to take good heed; seeing that all that which he hath spoken, doth set forward this his intent and purpose, he saw it would not be any inconueni∣ence, to vse therein some prolixity. If a man by compact, as
<PB REF="5"/> bound thereto by another, or of his owne proper motion and free will, and vpon curiosity, would vndertake a voyage of some three or foure leagues, not hauing any time prefixed nor limited for dispatch thereof, what harme would it be vnto him, if in his passage he doe find some Gardens where he may recreate and refresh himselfe, from the trauell and wearisomenesse of the way? So doe you my Masters reade this Treatise at your pleasure, vse it for your recreation, and take your delight in the sweete odours of her flowres and pleasant posies. You neede make no great hast, there is no man that doth vrge you thereto. A second reason of the pro∣lixity of this Treatise, is, for that as the Author is driuen of necessity to handle the vertues and the vices of diuers per∣sons and sundry Nations: so his will was, that each of them should haue his due desert: the good and those that haue done well, praise and honour; but the euill and vitious, blame and reprehension. In the end of this Treatise you shall find the explication which he promiseth, Fol. 143; in the which there are many things both of great curiosity, and also as necessary to the matter in hand as any of the rest. For that in knowledge, vnderstanding, and experience, hee doth farre exceed me, as his worke doth shew apparantly. Touching the which briefly, I dare not affirme any thing, but this, that each word of his is a sentence, and that each sentence containeth many. I must confesse, that to some persons in particular, his Treatise will be ill accepted: but what remedy? he hath spoken but the truth, and what he affirmeth he proueth, and hee alledgeth nothing without his Authour to iustifie it. And truly I for my part am of this o∣pinion: that it is not against reason, to publish the wicked∣nesse and vices of some one particular person, which being true, may be made knowne to euery man, especially when the knowledge thereof may redound to the great good and benefit of the weale publike. But to come to an end, let me entreat you to take in good part that which I haue said.</P>

The said <HI>Phi∣lip</HI> did deliberate in a solemne set Councell to stirre vp and procure a ciuill warre in France: saying,<Q REND="margQuotes">the French nation is at this day of such a nature, and likewise the English, that they neuer thinke vpon the time to come, nor care for any thing, but for the present, and that which they haue in hand, as being more desirous to gaine day by day three or foure Crownes then to keep three or foure thousand alrea∣dy gotten: so farre are they changed from their old and na∣turall disposition. For in former times they had a desire to goe abroad out of their owne Counttey for the succouring of Kings and Princes afflicted &amp; despoyled of their Realms and Dominions: and to make warre vpon the Infidels, and to chastise tyrants, whereas now their thoughts are quite &amp; cleane altered, and they doe set their minds altogether to the gotting of money v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on any conditions whatsoeuer, and
<PB N="3" REF="8"/> they are now growne to be no lesse in loue with the lasciui∣ousnesse, and delights of their owne country, then they are in dislike with the sterility and extreame heat of Spaine, &amp; other discommodities of this countrey: and for this cause we shall the more easily perswade and induce them to make warre within their owne countries, euen against their own brethren, cousins, parents, and countrimen, rather then a∣broade against their enemies. And for this cause I will and am resolued to spend one million of gold the more yearely, to the intent I may keepe and entertaine them alwayes in domesticall and ciuill warres. So that being held occupied, and hauing their hands full in their owne countrey, they shall not be able to resolue to passe into the Realmes and dominions of any other. And so by meanes hereof shall I be able easily to preserue the Realme of Portugall to my sefle with all that doth depend vpon it. And whatsoeuer it shall cost me the keeping, yet the profit will be greater then the expence, for that each yeare I doe leauy thereof neare three millions of gold, and continuing in the possession of the same. It may be that in time I shall be able to gaine the af∣fections and good wils of the Portugals, howbeit that I know they be now at this day very contrary against me. But hereafter, if I get them once to be my friends, and ha∣uing with them their strong ships, gallions, and other ves∣sels of warre, besides the good counsell and conduct of all their sage and experienced mariners, I shall make my selfe sole and absolute Lord of all the Ocean Sea, and I shall cause my selfe to be redoubted and obeyed throughout the whole world, and so wil I retaine &amp; keepe in my hands this realm, which of all the kingdoms of Spain is of most importance, to the intent I may leaue it sure &amp; peaceable to my succes∣sors.</Q> This is the sum of the speech which <HI>Philip</HI> had, and of the conclusions which he tooke with his counsell in the ci∣ty of Tison in Nouember 1582. after the arriual thither of the Marquesse <HI>de Santa Cruce,</HI> at such time as he returned victorious from the Iland of <HI>S. Michaell.</HI> In the same
<PB N="4" REF="9"/> Councell was by him also laid the first and principall stone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The league of France made in imitation of that in the yeare 1463. Stephen Gari∣bay. lib. 17. cap. 10. 11 12.</NOTE> whereupon the late League of France was founded. And there it was first by him ordained, concluded and baptized, in imitation of that which was so named, and made by the rebels in Castile against King <HI>Henrie</HI> the fourth, and which afterwards was againe reuiued in fauour of <HI>Isabell</HI> and <HI>Fer∣dinand</HI> his great grand parents. This great designe and re∣solution of his was faithfully reported vnto the said King (as hath beene said) by this stranger his seruant with many particularities: and amongst others, that the Castilian had sent into France nine sundry men, of purpose to corrupt with mony and faire promises, the Princes, Lords and Gentlemen of France, of whom many were particularly named, who from thence forward held the party of <HI>Philip,</HI> and many which were ready to doe the like, as the euent did afterwards make manifest. And the said <HI>Philip</HI> to gaine likewise the Captaine <HI>Landreau,</HI> had once resolued to send into France the Captaine <HI>Anthony,</HI> a Portugall, who being married at <HI>Rochel,</HI> was at that time prisoner in the Castle of <HI>Lisbone;</HI> and for this effect had granted him his life, with offer of his good fauour by the meanes and procurement of the <HI>Alcade Tayade,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A leade is the grand Prouost of the kings house.</NOTE> who did oftentimes repaire to the castle of purpose to see and visit him, and had conference with him for a long time together. Notwithstanding <HI>Philip</HI> fearing least he should discouer the practise, caused him af∣terwards to be hanged, notwithstanding the promise hee had made him. This Captaine <HI>Anthony</HI> discouered the whole matter vnto a certaine personage in whom he had great trust and affiance, and requested him to keepe it very secret, till such time as he should be gotten into France, to aduertise the most Christian king thereof, and the king of Portugall: vnto whom the said Captaine <HI>Anthony</HI> had prai∣ed him to communicate it, as he did. And as touching the Captaine <HI>Landreau,</HI> he was enforced to take part with the Castilian, and to accept the mony that was offred him for the safetie of his owne life: whereof also he aduertised the
<PB N="5" REF="9"/> king of Portugall, who was then at Beauvais on the Sea: and hauing giuen him to vnderstand to what intent he had done it; he prayed him to looke to the safeguard of his per∣son, for that he was in exceeding great danger. The which the said Prince <HI>Don Anthonio</HI> did within few dayes after proue to be most true, and had beene taken, if he had not sa∣ued himselfe with great speed, as there was then taken one of his sonnes, with many gentlemen Portugals of his traine, by the people of the Duke <HI>de Mercaeur:</HI> who did ransacke and make spoile of all that did appertaine both to him and his traine, of whom some held themselues happy, that they could get away in safetie. Of these nine men (of whom I haue spoken) certaine were apprehended, who discouered the whole intention of the enemy. Notwithstanding as little and small reckoning was made thereof at that time, as there is now at this day of any thing, be it held neuer so ne∣cessary and needfull to free vs from vtter ruine and destru∣ction. Moreouer, the same stranger (of whom wee haue made mention) did at the same time of his comming, ad∣vertise the most Christian king, that it was reported throughout all Spaine, among all persons of any good sort and qualitie, that his Catholike Maiestie had resolued to enter into league, and to confederate himselfe (Sir) with your Maiestie, and to make you great proffers, to your ex∣ceeding great benefit and aduantage, so that you would make warre vpon the sayd late king your predecessor. Be∣sides, it was reported, that he promised to giue vnto your Maiestie a pension of two hundreth thousand crownes a yeare. Howbeit, some say, that this was onely to be for an earnest and assurance of his promises: and they doe affirme this for most certaine; that the two hundreth thousand crownes were all in a readinesse within a castle named <HI>Ox∣agaui</HI> appertaining to the Lord of Luxes not farre from Rounceual. And it was further reported at the same time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip by vn∣lawfull trea∣ties laboreth to stir vp war against the French king</NOTE> that the said <HI>Philip,</HI> to be the better assured of the amitie of your Maiestie, did demaund to haue in mariage the La∣die

Your Maie∣stie should know these things here alledged better then any other: and whether the report which ran thereof at that time (when he did hold treatie with you) were true or no. Surely this was a great tentation: but the lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, which your Maiestie bare to your countrey, and the obligation of loy∣alty which you ought vnto your king, had more force and interest in you, then all the promises of an ambitious Ty∣rant. The bruite which ran thereof throughout all France, and also the certaine report of the ill entertainment giuen by your Maiestie to a gentleman, who had the managing of this businesse, and had made an ouerture thereof vnto you, did gaine you the affections of all good Frenchmen: who did thereupon imprint you in their hearts, and much more, when it was knowne, that your Maiestie had aduer∣tised the most Christian king of the same, in the year 1583 Insomuch that his Maiesty did permit you the yeare fol∣lowing 1584. to make an assembly of the chiefe Heads and Lords of the religion at Mountaban: where it was well knowne, that your Maiesty did sharply reproue those which had plotted these troublesome practises, and others which were seene afterwards to bee set abroach by the e∣nemy, in the yeare 1585. And that your Maiestie did then make an accord reciprocally, neither to enterprise, nor to deliberate vpon any thing, the one against the other.
<PB N="7" REF="10"/> And it was reported, that all the pretended reformed Chur∣ches in this assembly, did require your Maiestie for their Chiefe; and secondly, <HI>Monsieur</HI> the Prince of Conde: and that all this was done by the permission of the said most Christian King; who did greatly repent himselfe, that hee had let passe the oportunitie, to giue aid and succours to the late king of Portugall, for the recouerie of his Realme, as himselfe declared to that stranger aboue mentioned, being at Bloys, in the yeere 1589. At which time he complained of the tyrannie and irreligion of <HI>Philip,</HI> and sent him into England, there to entreat vpon his affaires with the Queene and the King of Portugall: vnto whom hee promised, that the first thing which he would doe, after he had recouered Paris, should be, to send an armie into Portugall, and to make warre vpon the enemie within his owne countrey, and to constraine him to demand peace, as the English with the aid of the Portugals had at other times constrained his predecessors to doe the like. And in case, that the said King of Portugal did and should vndertake the Voyage, as it was giuen him to vnderstand that he was so resolued; he prayed him, that so soone as he should be arriued thither, he would aduertise him hereof; to the intent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The desire that the Frēch K.

For as soone as the newes came, that the King of Portugall was at Lisbon, the most Christian King, for the accomplishing of his pro∣mise, commanded the late <HI>Monsieur,</HI> the Marshall <HI>de Biron,</HI> that he should put himselfe in a readinesse to passe into Por∣tugall with as great speed and diligence as was possible, for to succour the Portugals, and to giue aide to their rightfull King <HI>Don Anthonio,</HI> to reestablish him in his Kingdome.</P>

<P>Wherefore, most excellent Princes, to deliuer your estates from the danger that threateneth them, and to set them in assurance, you ought to vndertake, and to enterprise this Voyage, so importune, and so necessarie for all Christen∣dome, without hauing any regard to the charge thereof, be it neuer so great, considering that in not doing it, and that presently, you shall euery day more and more in time to come, bring your selues into hazard and extreame danger.

<P><HI>Agathocles,</HI> after he had beene about seuen yeeres King of Sicily, being enuironed both by Land and by Sea, within the Citie of Syracusa, by the Carthaginians: and finding himselfe in great trouble and perplexitie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How impor∣tant a thing it is, to make war vpon an enemy in his owne Countrey.</NOTE> as being lately forsaken of many people of his owne Realme, who had at the first beene partakers with him; and perceiuing also that he wanted both victuals, money, and other necessarie muni∣tions for the warre, and that it was not possible for him to escape out of the hands of the Carthaginians, if he did not vse some draught or deuice, which had not erst beene put in practise: He did at the last leaue within the Towne a bro∣ther of his owne, to whom hee committed the commaund and charge thereof, and left with him for the defence there∣of, a certaine number of men, whom he knew to be well af∣fected vnto him; and taking with himselfe certaine other troopes, he embarked them, vnknowne to any whither hee
<PB N="9" REF="11"/> went, and setting sayle to Africke, hee there landed: where hee warred so couragiously vpon the Carthaginians, as if they had beene but his equals. And hauing at the first be∣ginning defeated certaine of their Captaines that came a∣gainst him, he ouer-ran, harried, and wasted all their Coun∣trey, hee burnt and ransacked all their Townes, Villages, and houses of pleasure round about Carthage. After which victorie and good fortune, with a certaine number of soul∣diers, Bandoliers, and aduenturers, which came and ioyned themselues with him (a thing vsuall and ordinarie in such tumultuous and troublesome times) he encamped within a League of Carthage. By this stratageme, his affaires did not onely prosper in Africke, but throughout all Sicily also: for <HI>Antander</HI> (so was his brother named) being certified of the good successe of <HI>Agathocles,</HI> tooke courage vnto him, and sallying out of Syracusa vpon the Carthaginians that besieged him, hee woon their trenches, and hauing slaine a great number of them, hee made such hauocke a∣mongst them, that this their ouerthrow, and the victories of Africke, being spread abroad and reported, from thence∣forth all the strong-holds and places of Sicily (that before held with the Carthaginians) did then reuolt from them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This was a∣bout 314. yeres before the birth of Christ</NOTE> and did altogether abandon them: which was the occasion also, that <HI>Agathocles</HI> returning victorious into Sicily, did all the rest of his life time afterwards enioy it quietly and peaceably.</P>
<P>After the death of <HI>Agathocles,</HI> and his partizans, the Signiorie of Carthage continued the Warre for the Con∣quest of Sicilia, in such sort, that in the end they carryed it, and held the whole Island in their possession, which was about 277. yeeres before the birth of Christ. Where∣upon the Romanes considering of all these their exploits, and perceiuing that the puissance of the Carthaginians was very great, and that they held not onely the grea∣test and best part of Africke, which they had subdued by force of Armes, but also many peoples of Spaine,
<PB N="10" REF="12"/> with sundry Isles in the Sea, round about Sardinia &amp; Italy, they did very wisely imagine, that this neighbourhood of theirs would proue very dangerous &amp; perillous vnto them, if they should finish and goe through with the conquest of all Sicily. For this cause they tooke such good order in pro∣uiding for their affaires, as they brought the Carthaginians to this extremitie, that they had no more in their possession saue the Towne of Erix: the which <HI>Amilcar Barcyn,</HI> the father of <HI>Hanniball,</HI> did defend against them most valiantly for a long time, and did therein maruellous deeds of armes. Notwithstanding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This was a∣bout 240 yeres before the birth of Christ</NOTE> the Carthaginians seeing that they could not withstand nor resist the force and puissance of the Ro∣mans, they sent a messenger vnto <HI>Amilcar,</HI> commanding him to render and deliuer vp the Towne immediately, and to make peace with them, to the greatest honor, profit, and ad∣uantage that he could possibly, for the state of Carthage.</P>
<P><HI>Amilcar</HI> (doing as the Seigniorie had commanded him) gaue vp the Towne to the Consul <HI>Luctatius,</HI> and within few dayes after, following the course of his affaires, returned in∣to Africke, where hee had many victories against certaine seditious persons: and so he setled the estate of Carthage in rest and quietnesse.<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the yeere 237.</NOTE> This done, hee made a voyage into Spaine, taking with him his sonne <HI>Hanniball,</HI> who was not then aboue eight or nine yeeres of age, together with his mother (who was a Spaniard) and three other of his youn∣ger sonnes, <HI>Asdrubal, Mago,</HI> and <HI>Hanno;</HI> of whom, <HI>Amil∣car</HI> their father was wont to say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A saying of Amilcar tou∣ching Hanni∣bal and his o∣ther sonnes.</NOTE> That hee nourished foure fierce Lyons whelpes, who were resolute to worke the de∣struction of the estate of Rome. <HI>Amilcar</HI> then being in Spaine, by his prudence and liberalitie did gayne the hearts and good affections of the Spaniards, that he knew well he should be able by their meanes to haue about againe with the Romans, to recouer from them both Sicilia and Sardi∣nia (which they had also in their puissance) and that so in the end he might passe from thence into Italy, and there to procure their vtter ruine and destruction. But being pre∣uented
<PB N="11" REF="12"/> by death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the yeere 228.</NOTE> he charged his sonne <HI>Hannibal</HI> (whom hee had coniured to be, during his life, an vtter and vnreconcila∣ble enemie to the Romans) to put this his enterprise in exe∣cution. <HI>Hannibal,</HI> after the death of <HI>Asdrubal</HI> his brother in law (who succeeded his father in law <HI>Amilcar</HI> in that gouernment) being then made gouernour of Spaine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the yeere 223.</NOTE> tooke the Citie of Saguntum (which is now called Monvedre) after hee had held it besieged the space of eight moneths.<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the yeere 217.</NOTE> After the taking whereof, he began to dispose and prepare himselfe to the voyage of Italy: and hauing with great tra∣uailes and many difficulties passed the Alpes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the yeere 216.</NOTE> he obtayned in proces of time so many notable victories against the Ro∣mans, and did put them in such feare and terror,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hannibal pas∣seth into Italy.</NOTE> that they did in a manner hold themselues vtterly vndone &amp; forlorne. And so had they beene indeed, if they had not beene aduised to send <HI>Scipio</HI> into Africke:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scipio goeth against Car∣thage.</NOTE> who made such cruell warre so forcibly and so violently vpon the Carthaginians, that hee constrayned them to call home <HI>Hannibal</HI> out of Italy; who within short time after, with the whole estate of Carthage, was ouerthrowne &amp; brought to nought, as is well knowne vnto all men. And so by this meanes were the Romans ea∣sed and deliuered, enioying peace and quietnesse, and the Carthaginians vndone, defeated, and subdued: and their estate (which had beene so famous and renowned) was vt∣terly ruinated and brought vnder the power and puissance of their enemies.</P>
<P><HI>Xerxes</HI> King of Persia seeing himselfe in a miserable e∣state, and bethinking how he might deliuer and rayse him∣selfe vp againe, he made choyse of certaine of his seruants, fit for the execution of his intended purpose, and them hee sent into Europe with store of money, to corrupt the Ora∣tors of the Townes and Commonwealths of Greece: and hauing corrupted them of Athens and of Thebes, hee made them to rise in armes, and to make warre vpon the Spar∣tans.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plutarch in the life of Agesi∣laus.</NOTE> By this meanes Greece being set in trouble and dis∣sention, sent for <HI>Agesilaus</HI> (who hauing at that time subdued

And because the Money of Persia had an Archer engrauen on the one side thereof, the same <HI>Agesilaus</HI> had a saying, That ten thousand Archers had driuen him out of Asia, and had beene the cause to make him loose a most stately and puissant Empire. By this pol∣licie then did <HI>Xerxes</HI> rid himselfe from the trouble and ex∣tremitie wherein he was, driuing out his enemie from his Countrey, and recouering his estate, that was neere ruine and confusion.</P>

<P>I will omit many other Histories, which make notably to this our purpose, because I know well that these are suf∣ficient to shew how greatly it concerneth and importeth the Protestant Princes, and most Christian King of France to free your selfe from the encombrance of this burthen now laid vpon you, and to send a good armie into Spaine: for as much as by such a voyage well handled and to good purpose, dependeth both the safety of your selues, and the ruine of your enemy. If you make warre vpon your enemy within Spaine, hee shall be compelled to call home all his forces, not onely from France &amp; the Low Countries, but al those which he hath in Lombardy, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, and other countries:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The meanes to ruina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the enemy.</NOTE> we had good proofe and experience hereof euen of late: For as soone as the Castilian saw the English possess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of Calice, hee did incontinently send for all his gallies of Naples, Sicily, and Genes: He sent to in∣treate the grand master of <HI>Maltha</HI> to send him the Gallies appertaining to the knights of the Religion. Which had been done if the French Gentlemen, which were of the or∣der, had not opposed themselues against it. He caused in all haste the Forces which hee had in Brittaine to passe into Spaine: and there is no doubt but hee had likewise called home all those which he had in other countries, if the Eng∣lish had remained there any longer time. You see then (most excellent Princes) that by passing into Spaine, you may withdraw from o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er your heads the sword of the Castilian and deliuer your country from his proud yoke and tyranny. But you will say: the enemy hath great and puissant forces, and a great number of old and expert souldiers; by whose meanes, albeit they be farre off, yet being called backe into Spaine, he will greatly endamage and annoy you, and con∣sequently, your voyage may proue vnprofitable, and per∣haps very dangerous: and so you may be enforced to retire and returne home againe, not onely with shame and con∣fusion, but (which is more) in great trouble and extreame perill. But vnto this I answer.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Good and sound counsell</NOTE>First, if you do all things with prudence and good aduise, <MILESTONE N="1"/> you reape thereby incredible profit and commoditie, and the danger will be small, or none at all.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"/> Secondly, that in Spaine there are many places vpon the Sea coast which you may easily take and command, and whose situation is so strong by nature, that if they be for∣tified by art and the industrie of man, you shall defend and keepe them with a very small charge, and much more easily then the enemy doth keepe <HI>Blauet</HI> in Brittaine: and those will serue you for sure places of retrait.</P>
<P>Thirdly, in Spaine there are many nations which do hate the Castilian extremely: for that they haue beene tyranni∣zed, either by himselfe, or by his predecessors: and these (when they shall see themselues aided and assisted in good earnest, and to purpose) for the great desire which they haue to be at libertie, will soone take armes against the e∣nemie.</P>
<P>Fourthly, those Souldiers which are out of Spaine being called backe by their Lord and master, cannot arriue there within foure moneths at the soonest, and within two moneths may you arme and furnish fit and ready for the warres, all those of the countrey which will take your part. For this is most certaine, that the very Climate of the coun∣trey doth helpe and aide to make them able and actiue. I my selfe, and many others in Portugall haue sometimes seene a company of new souldiers at their first entring into garrison, to seem rather a troupe of beggers, and poore ras∣cals, rather then souldiers, al of them being so poore, naked and miserable, as we had pittie to see them; and yet within foure or fiue dayes, after that they haue beene new appa∣relled, and well appointed, if you had seene them settled in the garrison, you would haue said, that they had beene great Gentlemen, and they did carrie themselues with so good a grace and countenance, as if they had beene braue and old trained souldiers. I doe assure you, that two moneths will suffice to them of the country to make them souldiers.
<PB N="15" REF="14"/> The greatest difficultie is to make them abide, and not to feare the fire of the Hargubush. Moreouer, the Prouinces of Spaine are rich, as all the world knoweth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The nature of the naturall Spaniard.</NOTE> and the inhabi∣tants make not any account nor reckoning of their wealth, when there is any question for the recouering of their li∣bertie. For in this case they will not spare to spend it libe∣rally, as was to be seene by the offer which they made to king <HI>Philip,</HI> after that the Englishmen were retired from Calice: and therefore by sending of money into these quar∣ters, they will gather together fiftie thousand men of warre to passe into Spaine for their succour, defence, and preser∣uation, sooner then the enemie shall bee able to cause fiue thousand to come thither from any forraine partie.</P>
<P>If any man shall say, that seeing two moneths are suffi∣cient to make the naturall Spaniards good souldiers, the e∣nemy may therfore much sooner assemble and arme a great number of men then we shall get for succour. I answer: I would agree thereto, if there were in Spaine armes suffici∣ent wherewith to arme and furnish them: but they are so rare and daintie there to be had, that there bee many great townes notably well peopled, within the which a man can∣not finde fiftie Hargubushes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Armes very rare in Spaine.</NOTE> And if there were any store of armes to be had, yet the Spaniards in Spaine would take armes sooner, and much more cheerefully for their libertie, then for the seruice of one that tyrannizeth ouer them. E∣specially the Princes and great Lords, who doe desire no∣thing so much as that there were some realme or prouince within Spaine in full and free libertie, and which might be gouerned by it selfe, to the intent it might serue them for a place of refuge and sanctuarie, as they had the like in times past. For Spaine being in manner as an Iland, at this day the Princes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spaine in ma∣ner of an Ilād.</NOTE> Lords and Gentlemen of marke cannot easily withdraw themselues from thence; by meanes whereof they are held in great slauerie and subiection. When there were seuerall kings in Nauarre, Arragon and Portugall, if the Castilians were at any difference with their king, or
<PB N="16" REF="15"/> the Nauarrois, the Arragonois, or Portugals with theirs, they would haue retired themselues the one to the other; by whose liberalitie they were euer prouided of all things needfull and necessary for the life of man, and sometimes with greater ease and commodity then in their owne coun∣trey: as it happened in the time of <HI>Fernand</HI> king of Portu∣gall, and of <HI>Henrie</HI> the second king of Castile, who slue his owne naturall and lawfull brother; which was the cause that <HI>County Don Fernand de Casire,</HI> and <HI>Don Alvar peres de Castre</HI> his brother: <HI>Men Suares,</HI> Grandmaster of <HI>Alcantara: Suer Iuan de Parada</HI> Gouernour of the Realme of Galatia: <HI>Petro Giron,</HI> Grandfather of <HI>Calatraua, Alonso Giron</HI> his Nephew, and many other great Lords and Gentlemen, with a great number of Cities and Townes holding the party of the king deceased, did conuey themselues into Portugall, where they were receiued by the king <HI>Fernand,</HI> and had most honourable entertainment, with most nota∣ble fauours, rich presents, and incredible gifts, which hee gaue vnto them most bountifully. In so much that from thenceforth the <HI>Castres</HI> did continue still and inhabit in Portugall, from whom are descended those which are there of that name now at this day.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hierom Gu∣liel. cap. 23. fol. 81 pag. 2.</NOTE> The like happened to <HI>Diego Lopez Pacheco</HI> a Portugall (albeit not for so iust and ho∣nourable a cause) who going from Portugall into Castile for being charged with the death of the Queene <HI>Dame Iues de Castro,</HI> in the time of the king <HI>Don Peter</HI> of Portugall, hee was then created Lord of Beiar, and his children also made Lords of other peoples, of whom the Marquesse of Villana, the Dukes of Escalon, and many other great Lords haue their descent and originall.

Somewhat of this matter a man may see in the end of the booke of Explication of the Genealogie of his most Christian Maiestie, where
<PB N="18" REF="16"/> it is spoken of the first king of Castile.</P>
<P>Moreouer, the said <HI>Conestagio,</HI> as a man of a maligne and peruerse spirit, is a most vngratefull enemy of that nation, which hath both aduanced and honoured him. For wee knew him at Lisbon when he serued <HI>Anthonio Caulo,</HI> and afterwards with <HI>Stephen Lercaro,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">3. fol. 62.</NOTE> a Marchant of Genoa. He hath in his booke these words:
<Q>In Castile this succession gaue great matter whereof both to muse and to talke, both in priuate and in publike: for that the king caused the Estate of Portugall to be vnited to his other Realmes and Dominions, not caring how, nor in what fashion it were done, so it were effected. The which the Nobilitie tooke very ill: in so much as it seeemeth that all the great men of Spaine, since the time of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth to this day, could not away nor like of the greatnesse of the king: because thereof it hath proceeded; that hee maketh lesse reckoning of them then did the ancient kings of Castile, and hee constrai∣neth them to be equall to their inferiours, as well in iustice as otherwise.</Q></P>
<P>If <HI>Don Antonio</HI> king of Portugall were liuing, hee could witnesse, how after that the enemie was entred in∣to Portugall with a huge armie, and had taken <HI>Lisbon,</HI> hee being then in the towne of Badaios, many Lords of Castile did offer him to haue entrance into the sayd towne, and did promise him all their best aide and assistance to seize vpon the enemie himselfe. The which the said Prince could not effect nor put in execution; for that within few dayes after he was dispossessed of all the realme in the citie of <HI>Puerto</HI> of Portugall. He could also certifie vs, how that seeing in these parts many great Lords of Castile did send vnto him, offring him their seruice and assistance, in case that he would set foot in Portugall: the which matter he commu∣nicated (if I bee not deceiued) to the king and principall Lords of France, and principally to the estate and Coun∣cell
<PB N="19" REF="16"/> of England. Notwithstanding, touching this desire of libertie, it is a matter which doth principally touch the Princes, great Lords, and <HI>Hijos de Algo</HI> of Spaine. For, as concerning those masters of the long robe, and the ras∣call sort of Castilians; they take a pleasure in this their sla∣uery and seruitude vnder the king, because they alone doe command and rule all, and triumphing ouer others, haue the principall and chiefe managing of all the affaires of the Realme: yea, and euen the gouernment of the king himselfe, in their owne hands. And although they doe hate him most extremely, and doe wish ill enough to his person: yet not∣withstanding they doe wish so well to their owne country, and doe so delight to see themselues to haue the command ouer all others; that if they know any thing, either in pub∣like or in priuat, which might hinder and endamage his ty∣rannie, they will not faile, onely in regard thereof, to ad∣uertise him of it: such is the naturall disposition of the Ca∣stilians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iosephus de bello Iudaice lib. 1. cap. 3.</NOTE> who being issued and sprung from the race of the Iewes, cannot but follow the tracke of their predecessors. Today they would follow and honour <HI>Antigonus,</HI> to mor∣row they would accuse his bountie, as a crime of high trea∣son, and iudge it to bee little lesse then pride and vanitie, and as traitors they abandon and forsake him, accusing him before <HI>Aristobulus,</HI> and so be the causers of his death and destruction. And therefore most humbly I beseech your Maiesties, and all Christian Princes, to keepe your selues from the Castilians, and not to trust them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Good and sound counsell</NOTE> howsoeuer they shew themselues mortal and deadly enemies to their kings, and do make neuer so faire semblance, that they are well and heartily affected to do you seruice.</P>
<P>The common sort of Castilians (Sir) are so maligne and peruerse, so full of pride, arrogancy, ambition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The malitious nature of the Castilian na∣tion.</NOTE> tyran∣ny, and infidelity; that <HI>Fernand</HI> king of Portugall, being the right and lawfull heire to the Realmes of Castile and Leon, and being called vpon by the people of the same kingdomes, who offred to receiue him for their Lord and
<PB N="20" REF="17"/> king, the Portugals would in no wise consent therunto, say∣ing: that they would not haue any thing to doe, nor med∣dle with them, no not though it were to command ouer them. It was my hap one day, to deuise vpon this matter with a noble man of the French kings Councell, who see∣ming much astonished at the report thereof, did make mee this answer: Certainly, this that you tell me, doth make me not so much to maruell, as that which I haue heard re∣ported of a Fryer Preacher, who in the yeare of our Lord 1576.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. 22.</NOTE> preaching vpon this part of the Gospel: <HI>Thou shalt loue the Lord thy God, &amp;c. and thy neighbour as thy selfe:</HI> said, that by this precept, God commanded vs, not onely to loue our father and mother, brothers, kinsfolke, friends, and countreymen: but euen heretikes also and strangers, Iewes, Paynims,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An example worthy the marking.</NOTE> Moores, Turkes, and the Castilians themselues. This happened (as it was told him) and this Preacher was a religious person of the order of S. <HI>Dominicke,</HI> and he did Preach in a parish Chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch of Lisbon, called Saint <HI>Magda∣lens,</HI> being one of the principall Churches within the citie, and there were present at it, the most part of the Gouer∣nours of the towne, with many Presidents of the Parlia∣ment, Councellors, Gentlemen, and rich Marchants. The said noble man shewing himselfe greatly abashed at this report, did demand of me; how it could be tollerated, that this should be spoken openly in the Pulpit, and the religi∣ous person not punished for it. Whereunto I answered: that there wanted not any accusers, to call him in question for it: but the number of them (that did beare with him and fauoured him for the franknesse and libertie of this his speech) was so great,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Portugals hold the Ca∣stilians to be worse then In∣fidels.</NOTE> that those which did accuse him, could not be heard. Moreouer, it is an ordinary and vsuall thing with the Portugals, to say: <HI>That the Castilians are worse then the Infidels themselues.</HI> But let them speake the worst of them they can, yet will they beare and endure it, be∣cause they re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pe great benefite and aduantage by it. The which the sayd Nobleman seeing, in sort to make doubt
<PB N="21" REF="17"/> of, he did thus reply vnto me: Albeit I doe beleeue some part of this you say, yet there resteth one thing, which is as a scruple in my mind; and that is, in that (as I haue read) the Portugals and the Castilians are both of one and the same Prouince, and are borne in a manner of one Stock, and issued of one Root, and doe speake one and the selfe-same Language: that is the opinion of <HI>Conestagio,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conestag. lib. 1. fol. 4. pa. 2.</NOTE> of whom we haue before spoken. But he sayth he knoweth not what: for the Portugals are descended of the Gaules, the Celtes, and the Braccates, and their Language is almost the same with the Latine Tongue. But as touching the Castillians, we cannot certainely say, from whence they are descended: Neuerthelesse, the best iudgement and coniecture thereof, that can be made by circumstances and euident proofes, is, that they are descended of the Vandals, of the Iewes, and of the Moores; and their Language is in a manner all one with that of the Moores, and their pronunciation is all one, or much alike. Thereof it commeth, that the Castilli∣ans being in the countrey of the Saracens, or of the Turkes, they doe soone and very easily denie the Christian Faith, and doe turne altogether Turke and Infidell. True it is, that the Princes, great Lords, and <HI>Hijos de Algo,</HI> are ex∣tracted eyther from the Gothes, or from the ancient Spa∣niards, which inhabited the mountaines and the countries of Leon, and of Ouiedo, and the Prouince of Galitia, with∣in which is enclosed the ancient Portugall. <HI>Conestagio</HI> in the same place last before recited, sayth, that these two Nations doe hate each other most extreamely: and hee setteth downe one notable vntruth, to wit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The vntruth of Conestagio</NOTE> That the hatred of the Portugall doth farre exceed that of the Castillians; which is altogether false, and vntrue. The Portugals doe not hate the Castillians, but they abhorre their actions, as most wicked, and full of crueltie and tyrannie: The Castil∣lians on the contrarie, because they cannot with any reason hate the actions of the Portugals, for that they are good and iust, they doe therefore ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e their persons, who haue so
<PB N="22" REF="18"/> often ouercome, vanquished, and ill handled them; and so much the more, for that their numbers were alwayes (as a man may say) infinite, and the Portugals were very few, and in comparison of them, as nothing. The hatred of the Castillians is so certaine against the Portugals, that it is vsually spoken in manner of a prouerbe, That since the bat∣taile of <HI>Alijbarto,</HI> the Castillians would neuer suffer any to preach vpon the Fryday, in the first weeke of Lent; on which day the Church vseth to sing that part of the Gos∣pell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 5.</NOTE> where it is said, <HI>Loue your enemies:</HI> and therefore they iudge the Portugals to be like themselues; and they esteeme them to be of the same nature and disposition as they are. Both the one and the others hatred may well be seene by that which <HI>Charles</HI> the fift said one day to the Colonell <HI>Ferras,</HI> a Portugall, who in the warres betweene the sayd Emperour and <HI>Francis</HI> the first, King of France, did serue on the French partie against the Imperialists. The warres being ended, and peace concluded betweene those two Princes, the Portugall retyring himselfe into his countrey, did passe by the way of Castile, where he went to visit the said <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, who knew him very well, and did loue him for his valour; and doing him great honour in his Court, he stayed him there for certaine dayes with him: during which time, as hee was one day deuising with him very familiarly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A speech of Charles the 5. to Captaine Ferras, a Por∣tugall.</NOTE> hee vsed this speech vnto him:<Q REND="margQuotes">Captaine <HI>Ferras,</HI> I would gladly know, what should be the cause that made you to follow the partie of the French against me, seeing wee are of one and the same Nation? for al∣beit you be a Portugall, and I a Castillian, yet are we both Spaniards. The Colonell made him this answere: Sir, when the Portugals doe trauaile abroad out of their owne countrey, whether they be rich or poore, their onely end and scope is, to get them honour and reputation. For mine owne part, I had the meanes to liue honestly in my countrey, like a Gentleman: neuerthelesse, being resolued to see the world, I began to cast my account with my selfe,
<PB N="23" REF="18"/> what course I were best to take. Hauing made my recko∣ning, I conceiued with my selfe, that I should purchase me more honour, by bearing Armes against the greatest Cap∣taine of the World, then in taking of his part to serue a∣gainst any other: and for this cause I tooke Armes against your Maiestie. The Emperour smyling, sayd: I beleeue that this is not the cause, but rather the old rancour and hatred which the Portugals beare to the Castillians.</Q> Portugall answered him againe in great choller: <Q>Sir,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An excellent answere of a Portugall to Charles the 5.</NOTE> I sweare vnto your Maiestie, That neyther for good, nor for bad, I trouble not my minde with the Castillians, not so much as to thinke of them. </Q>The Emperour making sem∣blance as though this answere did content him, did em∣brace him many times and often: but hee iudged of the Portugall as his affection led him, for hee had enough of the bloud of a Castillian by his mothers side, to make him to hate him: <HI>A little Leauen, &amp;c.</HI> And thus may you see the vntruth of <HI>Conestagio:</HI> His Historie is well written, and in a good style, but most false, and full of passion, for hee both reprehendeth and iniurieth all those of whom hee speaketh; yea, euen King <HI>Philip</HI> himselfe, in whose fauour hee wrote it: and for this cause principally it was forbid∣den in Portugall. But leauing <HI>Conestagio,</HI> now that we haue shewed how the Castillian Nation is much more maligne and peruerse then all the other people of Spaine, I will tell you one thing worthy to be noted ere wee proceed, which doth more neerely touch the Portugall Nation than any of the rest; that is, That all those Nations generally are so desirous of libertie, that they doe seeke by all meanes pos∣sible to obtayne it, being readie to receiue euen the De∣uils themselues, if they would be readie to further and fa∣uour them in the same. And yet, if any strange Nation should passe into Spaine to any other end, they would vse the vttermost of their endeuours to stop their passage, and to hinder their entrance, making little or no reckoning of their liues, and much lesse of their goods and substance.
<PB N="24" REF="19"/> When I doe speake of causing strange Nations to passe into Spaine, I must tell you thus much, That they shall be much more welcome, and finde better entertainment of the peo∣ple of the Countrey, when they shall be mingled many and diuers Nations together, then if one should goe thither a∣lone: for that this diuersitie will take from them all conceit and suspition which they might otherwise haue, that their comming were to make a conquest of their countrey, and not to procure their libertie and freedome; and so they would vndoubtedly receiue them ioyfully, and with all as∣surance. In like manner, if the Tyrant should commaund them to goe to the warres out of their owne countrey, espe∣cially if it were for their Religion, they would serue him more faithfully then did <HI>Auila</HI> and <HI>Simancas</HI> in Castile, or <HI>Celorico</HI> &amp; the Castle of Coimbre in Portugall. For proofe hereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The meaning hereof is ex∣pounded in the end of this Treatise.</NOTE> you may remember, how in the yeere 1588. the King of Castile in his Fleet and Armie by Sea, that came vpon the Coast of France, sent two Regiments of Portu∣gals, each of them consisting of eight hundred men, or thereabouts.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The loyaltie of the Portu∣gals.</NOTE> These forces (notwithstanding, that in regard of his vsurpation of the countrey, they were enemies to him) yet hauing promised to serue him faithfully in this voyage, in the fight which they had against the Englishmen and Flemings, they did make such proofe of their valour, that they did farre excell all the rest of the Army in prow∣esse and deedes of Armes; and they alone did more for the seruice of the King of Castile, then all the residue of his Al∣lyes: insomuch, that there was none of them (who had command and gouernment in the Army) that were recei∣ued with honour by the King Catholike, saue only the Por∣tugall Colonels;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Portugall Co∣lonels in the Armie of the yeere 1588.</NOTE> namely, <HI>Gasper de Sousa,</HI> and <HI>Antonie Pe∣rera:</HI> The which <HI>Perera</HI> before that time had serued and fought most valiantly for the defence of the libertie of his Countrey, and for the seruice of his true and naturall King, against the said King of Castile, at such time as hee entred into Portugall with a mightie Army to inuade it.</P>

<P>And for the more distinct and cleare demonstration of the truth of this matter, I will recite vnto you a most true Historie.</P>
<P>In the yeere 1589. <HI>Don Anthonie,</HI> King of Portugall, ac∣companied with the Englishmen and Hollanders, made a Voyage into Portugall, and casting anchor in the Hauen of Penicha, they of the Castle began to play with their Ordi∣nance vpon the armie: but the Captaine of the Castle, <HI>An∣thonio de Arauio,</HI> a Portugall, being ascertained that the king <HI>Don Anthonio</HI> was in that armie, he forbad the Cannoniers to shoot any more, and caused a white Ensigne to be put forth; vpon sight whereof, <HI>Don Anthonio</HI> commanded that euery man should goe on shore, and take their way towards the Towne: the which they did, not without some resi∣stance made by certaine companies of Castillians, who in the end were forced to retyre, with the losse of some of their people. The first that arriued to the Towne, was the County of Essex, a Prince of the bloud Royall of England, and one that was adorned with many morall vertues. This
<PB N="26" REF="20"/> Lord comming to speake with the Captaine of the Castle, which was vpon the Wall, one of his companie sayd: My Lord, the Earle of Essex is come hither by the commande∣ment of the Queene of England, in whose name hee com∣mandeth to haue the Castle rendred vnto him. The Cap∣taine answered him; <HI>Philip</HI> King of Castile hath commit∣ted the keeping of this Castle vnto me, and for the same I haue done him homage: in regard whereof, I will defend it against all those that shall seeke to dispossesse me of it; and I will not yeeld it vp to any person, saue to the King <HI>Don Anthonio,</HI> because his it is, and I acknowledge him onely for my King and Lord: and if he be not in this armie, as hath been told me that he is, I would aduise that euery man doe retyre himselfe, otherwise I shall cause you all to loose your liues. Vpon this word, the Countie of Essex retyred himselfe to the Sea side, and there went to meete him, the Lords <HI>Scipio de Figueyredo Ʋascoucelles,</HI> late Gouernour of the Terceras, and <HI>Anthony de Brito Pimentell,</HI> and other Gentlemen Portugals of the Kings trayne; who vnderstan∣ding by the Count the speech of the Captaine, went on di∣rectly to the Castle, and assured the Captaine, that the King <HI>Don Anthonio,</HI> their Lord, was come thither. Within a while after the King arriuing there, and calling the Captaine, who knew him by his speech, hee made him this answere: Sir, I come to open the gates vnto your Maiestie. The port being opened, he kneeled downe before the King, and kissing his hands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The yeelding of the Castle of Penicha.</NOTE> deliuered him the Keyes of the Castle. This is most true, that if he would haue held good, the English armie had not bin able to haue taken that Castle, it was so well furni∣shed and prouided of artillerie, and all things necessarie: for besides great store of Iron peeces, there were 85. of Brasse.</P>
<P>All these examples doe shew euidently, how faithfull the Portugals are to them, to whom they haue once promised and plighted their faith and fidelitie. And for as much as I know that your Maiesties haue conceiued an opinion of me as of a person giuen to be somewhat curious, and who is
<PB N="27" REF="20"/> acquainted with the accidents which passed in this Voyage, and that your Maiesties haue a desire to vnderstand what was the cause why <HI>Don Anthonio</HI> did not continue in Por∣tugall, and what made him to render vp this Castle, and o∣ther places which were impregnable, and to returne into England with his armie, without doing any other act of any worth, and with the losse of the greatest part of his compa∣nie, with which he was embarked; I will briefely recount the successe of this Iourney, crauing many particularities, because to count them all, it would require much more time then is requisite for the finishing of this Treatise. I say then, that as God, when he chasteneth &amp; humbleth great Estates and Monarchies, doth suffer and permit, for the sinnes of the people, such as are like <HI>Pharao's, Nabuchodonozors, Caligu∣la's, Nero's,</HI> and <HI>Dioclesians,</HI> vsing them as his executioners and hangmen (as <HI>Attila</HI> called himselfe the Scourge of God, and <HI>Tamerlan</HI> the Wrath of God:) so it seemeth he hath per∣mitted, that K. <HI>Philip</HI> should be his minister &amp; the executio∣ner of his wrath &amp; anger; and that in his secret iudgement, beyond all apparance of humane reason, his will is not yet that Portugall should be deliuered and set at libertie: for it is not possible, that men should be so blinded, to their owne losse and destruction, as they were in this Voyage, if the Diuine puissance had not blinded them, by taking a∣way the vse of their sence and vnderstanding.</P>
<P>The greatest part of the Armie was embarked at Douer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The declarati∣on of the Por∣tugall Voyage in the yeere 1589.</NOTE> the 24. of March, and from thence went to Plimmouth: From thence they departed all together the 29. of Aprill; at which time perceiuing their numbers to be greatly di∣minished, by the contagion that was amongst them; in stead of taking the direct way to Portugall, they set their course for the Groine, where the most part of the souldiers died, and all the best Canoniers: insomuch, that their forces were much abated, and they gaue thereby good leysure vn∣to the enemie, both to send fresh men into Lisbon, and to draw out of Portugal those who were any way suspected:

They came to the Groine the sixt of May, where they were till the twentieth, on which day they did againe take shipping, and set sayle to∣wards Portugall, where they tooke land at Penicha the sixe and twentieth. From thence (hauing left in the Castle cer∣taine souldiers with <HI>Anthonie de Brito Pimentell,</HI> aboue na∣med, who is the chiefe of the House of the <HI>Pimentels</HI> of Spaine, and about 800. sick men) they tooke their way (the Generall <HI>Drake</HI> by Sea, and the Lord Generall <HI>Norris</HI> by Land) with 35. or 40. horse, and some 6000. foot, so ill ar∣med, that a good part of them wanted their Swords, and there was not of them aboue 50. Corslets: the cause where∣of, was want of Waggons and Carriages, for to carry them ouer the land; and the souldiers themselues were constrained to carry their powder on their shoulders. Besides, many of them at their departure out of their lodgings, had left their Pikes, and some their Harquebuses, loading themselues with pots &amp; bottels of Wine, which they found there in great a∣bundance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wine marreth all.</NOTE> the which in very truth did the more hinder and endomage them: for by meanes hereof they fell into diuerse diseases, and died in great numbers; the English Nation not being accustomed to drinke Wine alwayes, &amp; their Beere is not so strong a kind of drinke. The day following, 3. leagues before their arriuall to a Towne called <HI>Loires Vedras,</HI> the keyes of the Castle were brought to the king <HI>Don Anthonio,</HI> which Castle is so strong, that 20. men with necessarie mu∣nitions may keepe &amp; defend it against 100000. All the way along to Lisbon (which is 60. good miles) there was not one Castillian that durst appeare; and 7. horsemen English did put to flight 60. Castillians. From thenceforth many Portugals came to kisse the hands of their King, in great a∣bundance: notwithstanding, for that they came without armes, hauing beene before disarmed, and for that there
<PB N="29" REF="21"/> was no body of whom they might get or haue any neither for loue nor money (howbeit that they brought with them good store of siluer purposely to that effect) they did the most part of them returne againe to their owne houses: and there could not be armed of them aboue one thousand foot, and 120. horse with Lances and targets: notwithstanding that the number of them which came was in a manner in∣finite. Amongst whom there were many Gentlemen of good re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oning, who (because they were not clothed in Veluet and Satin, but plainly after the fashion of the coun∣trey) were not knowne nor acknowledged by the strangers to be of that qualitie. On the Friday the second of Iune,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The armie ar∣riueth at Lis∣bon.</NOTE> they came in the night time to Lisbon, and were lodged in the suburbs of Saint <HI>Katherine,</HI> which are so great, that there were aboue 12000. persons of the Armie lodged there all at large, and yet they held not the third part there∣of.

This suburbe is toward the West Lisbon;<NOTE PLACE="marg">6.

<PB N="30" REF="22"/> any part. The other reason was, for that being in that quar∣ter, on the East side, they should cleare and free the way for the good people of Portugall to come and to haue re∣course vnto their king. Now in that they tooke vp their lodging on the West part, was an occasion that the enemy might safely and at pleasure sally out of the towne with two hundred horse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A sally of the Castilians.</NOTE> who slew and tooke prisoners many Portugals, and a great quanrity of victuals which were sent by the townes that tooke part with the king: and they were an hindrance also to many others that they could not come to ioyne with him. The Saterday following, the third of Iune, about two or three houres after mid day, there issued out of the citie about two hundred horse and eight hundred foot; some of the which entring within the streets of the suburbs, and crying aloud, God saue the king <HI>Don An∣thonie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The great neg∣ligence of the officers of the armie.</NOTE> they came euen vnto one of the courts of Guard, and there slue to the number of thirteene or foureteene, for that they were lodged in the street without any Baricado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> made for the fortitying of their lodgings. Notwithstan∣ding the Portugals which followed the king, hauing disco∣uered them to be Castilians and not Portugals, did giue the Alarme so hotly, that a regiment of Englishmen with certaine Portugals making out towards the enemy, did charge him with that fury, that they made them betake themselues to plaine flight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The repulse &amp; flight of the Castilians.</NOTE> and slue of them vpon the place sixescore: besides that they tooke fortie or fiftie of their horses; and the flight of the Castilians was so hastie and headlong, that in their entry into the Citie, they left the gate of Saint <HI>Antan</HI> wide open. In this encounter died an English Cauallier, Colonel of a regiment named <HI>Bret,</HI> a braue man, and had great experience in the art Militarie. Now for that the Generall <HI>Drake</HI> did not enter within the port or hauen of the citie vntill the Sunday following (as was before resolued hee should haue done:) and for that also the most part of the souldiers had neither match nor powder left, saue onely for the discharge of some two or

This coun∣sell being ended, and <HI>Drake</HI> himselfe being a boord the ship called the Reuenge, did set saile about three houres after noone, and tooke his course towards Lisbon. Some thought he went to see the channell of <HI>Alcacena,</HI> which is an entry into the Hauen, by which men do commonly passe, which would auoyd the danger of the Tower of S. <HI>Iulian,</HI> because in this councell (where had beene called many old Pylots Portugals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tower of S.

Notwithstanding <HI>Drake,</HI> when it grew towards euening, turned the head of his ship to the Westward, by reason he was aduertised, that there passed by a Fleet of thirty saile of Esterlings: of the which hee tooke 25. or 26. But this hindered the resolution former∣ly taken; so as it sorted not to that effect which was purpo∣sed.

<P>I suppose that this short Discourse (which I haue here set downe, without specifying of any other the particularities of this expedition) will suffice to satisfie the desire of your Maiesties, and to shew the cause, why there was nothing done in Portugall, and that Gods will was not as yet to re∣establish her by the meanes of this voyage. And I say more∣ouer, that the principall cause,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The reason why so many faults were committed in the English Armie for Portugall.</NOTE> why so many faults and ouer∣sights were committed, and that nothing was performed or put in execution (according as had been resolued in coun∣cell, was, because this armie was leui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by Merchants, whereas in matters of this kinde, Princes onely ought to employ themselues, and that with a setled and aduised deli∣beration: in such sort, that there ought not any name of an army to be vsed, but by and from them onely: and they ought to haue more interest therein then any other, and ought to be at the whole and onely costs and charges both of leuying and maintaining of all armed forces. And last of all, to them alone doth belong the choyse and election both of the Heads and Leaders, and of one Generall and chiefe Commander: vnto whom, as to the Soueraigne, all the o∣thers should be subiect and obedient. See then the reason why the Lord Generall <HI>Drake</HI> (being named and sent by Merchants who were most ingaged in this voyage) did frame himself to do that which they would, and what came into his owne braine and fancy, rather then that which the other Lord Generall <HI>Norris</HI> did well and wisely aduise and counsell him, who was a man of singular experience, wis∣dome and vnderstanding, as well in politike gouernment, as in deeds of Armes, and all matters of warfare. For this worthy Lord did striue and labor by all meanes conuenient to haue made a longer abode in Portugall, both in the quar∣ters of Lisbon and elsewhere: but after that the army had
<PB N="34" REF="24"/> once set sayle, the said Lord General <HI>Norris</HI> could not from thence forward, by any entreaties, perswade <HI>Drake</HI> to set foot on land againe in Portugall, and not so much as to take one Citie, where it was wel knowne that there was not any forces, nor any resistance made: neyther was there any meane for the enemie eyther to haue succoured it, or after the taking thereof, to besiege it for one yeere at the least. Besides that, with the same it is most certaine, that they might haue found in Gold, Siluer, Silkes, and Clothes, more then a million of Duckats. Moreouer, the said place might easily haue beene fortified, and by that meanes might haue commanded many other places: and afterwards, money be∣ing sent into France, England, Holland, and other parts, they might haue leuied and led thither aboue fiftie thousand soul∣diers sooner, then the enemie could haue gotten together fiue thousand. And this I thinke will suffice for your Maie∣sties to vnderstand that which you desire in this behalfe.</P>
<P>But now let vs returne to the purpose which wee had in hand. We haue said, that by this one example it may easily be perceiued, how faithfull and loyall the Portugall Nation is to them, vnto whom they do once promise faith and loy∣altie: and therefore God graunt, that they doe not accord nor vnite themselues to the Castilian, and that neyther your Maiesties, nor the other Princes and Potentates of Europe doe not consent nor permit them to doe it, nor doe giue them occasion to lose the hopes which they yet haue of their libertie. And you ought not to attend or stay vpon the death of <HI>Philip:</HI> for it may be, that the Portugall will more easily accord with the sonne then with the father. And fur∣ther, as the Monarchie of the Castillian is neyther gouer∣ned nor conserued with the sword, but by good and sage counsaile; so albeit he should die, yet the same counsaile con∣tinueth and remaineth still. Besides, for these many yeeres of late, it hath beene gouerned without his presence: and therefore there is little or no hope for any great change or alteration by his death.</P>

<P>Now of what great weight and importance this matter will be, <HI>Don Francisco de Ivara</HI> (the father of <HI>Don Diego de Ivara,</HI> lately Embassadour at Paris during the League) did confesse and make knowne vnto a French Gentleman at Madril, in the yeere 1579. The Gentleman is yet liuing, and can testifie the truth of that which I will now tell you. The said <HI>Francis</HI> demaunding of that Gentleman (who was then newly come from Barbarie, where the late King had sent him, for certaine of his affaires) what newes hee brought out of that Countrey? his answere was, That the Moores were in a notable feare, by reason they had intelligence, that the King Catholike did leuie a great Armie to passe into Barbarie, to reuenge the death of his Nephew, the King <HI>Don Sebastian.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The speech of a Spanish no∣bleman to a French Gen∣tleman.</NOTE> Whereunto the sayd <HI>Francis</HI> replyed, It is not amisse that the Moores should be in feare: but it were more meet, that the King your Maister did vnderstand to what end this Armie is leuyed; for in very deede, it is for Portugall.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The most Christian king and all the Princes and Potentates of Europe haue great reason to hinder that the Portugals doe not accord with the Ca∣stillians, and that they giue them no occa∣sion to lose the hope of their libertie.</NOTE> And if the King Catholike, my Lord, doe make himselfe Mai∣ster of that Realme, as hee verily hopeth (for hee hol∣deth it in a manner as alreadie wrought and practised) hee will bring to passe, that not onely the most Christi∣an King shall be inferior and tributarie vnto him, but also all the other Princes of Europe shall bee subiect vn∣to him, especially the seuen vnited Prouinces of the Low Countreyes: and the Pope, with all the Court of Rome, shall doe nothing but what seemeth good vn∣to him; because, hauing added vnto his Empire the Monarchie of Portugall, who can be able to resist him?

<P>This that wee haue here left recited, doth prooue that which was before spoken: and therefore to returne to the matter in hand: I say in the fifth and last place, that when∣soeuer a great and puissant army shall be raised to passe in∣to Spaine, be the charge neuer so great, if it do nothing else then wast and spoile the countrey, and take some few cities and townes, and if in regard thereof the Castilian be enfor∣ced to call home his forces (which he holdeth in these parte of Europe for his owne defence, though the comming of those his forces should cause our army to retire, yet I should hold this for a very great benefit; because that which can∣not now be done with an hundred, will then be done with ten men, and the charge and expences will bee still lesse and lesse. But it may be, that some of your Maiesties subiects will say vnto me, that this is a matter of great difficultie, and at this time especially very hard to be done: for that hauing the enemy here at hand, euen at our backes, there were small reason for vs to transport our forces into foraine parts. This a good doubt, and may be some trouble to men of a shallow and small vnderstanding, and such as haue lit∣tle iudgement to discourse vpon the state of matters: but to them which know the depth and ground of things, it will carry no apparance of danger. But to the intent the trueth may the better appeare, let vs reason together each with o∣ther by way of demanding and answering, as is vsed in the Schooles.</P>

Take that which I tell you, as I speake it, and not as you conceiue it, and answer me to one question ca∣tegorically. If there were now an armie raised to goe into Spaine, to the making whereof, let France spare some foure or fiue thousand men: England three or foure thousand: the Estates of Holland, Zeland, Freezland, and all the rest of their Allies, two or three thousand, besides ships, of which they haue great store; and let some other Princes, Poten∣tates, and Common-weales, disburse some proportion of money, for the aiding and furthering of this enterprise: &amp; to these adde three or foure thousand Zwitzers or Lance knights: and then tell me shall France bee vnprouided? or shall England be dispeopled? or shall the Estates be vnfur∣nished of men and shipping, and without meanes to keepe the Seas? or shall the other Princes and common-weales be reduced to such misery, that they shall be vnable to hold their ordinary course in their affaires and proceedings: but rather as they may well spare twice so many men to furnish them to passe into Spaine out of the seuerall King∣domes, and yet they are sufficient to imploy greater forces into other his dominions in the West, and neuerthelesse powerfully maintaine their owne. <HI>Sub.</HI> No: I think not so. <HI>Pilg.</HI> Why then doe you not that which concerneth you so neere, and whereof dependeth the whole and onely remedy of your mischiefe and misery, and wherein you for your part, haue a greater interest then any of the rest. <HI>Sub.</HI> Marry sir: to make vp these thousands of men which you speak of; there must be had great store of mony, which will as hardly be had, as they that haue it, will be loth to depart with it. <HI>Pilg.</HI> O how blind is this people! and how deuoyd of counsell and prudence is this nation!

<PB N="38" REF="26"/> they would be wise, and that they would vnderstand, and prouide for things to come. Our towne, which the enemy may take to morrow next, doth it not import vs more then 300000. crownes, which is the most that wee shall neede for the furnishing of 4. or 5. thousand men? If after the taking of Laon, and the reducing of so many good townes, there had been imployed 200000 crowns, which are demanded for this enterprise, it may bee, you should haue had by this time more then three milllions in your purse, and you should not haue lost al these towns in France of so great import; Cambray, Dourlan, Calice, Ardes, A∣miens, and many other places, with your great Admirall: and so many braue gentlemen and Captaines which are now dead, would stil haue liued to speake in French. More∣ouer, doe not excuse your selfe and say for your discharge, that a man cannot diuine what will follow: for you haue beene too too much forewarned of matters as they haue fallen out, and there is yet liuing a Lord, one of the Coun∣cell, who at Fountaine Belleau in May 1595. did by all meanes he could possibly deuise, perswade the vndertaking of this enterprise; alledging so many reasons and so euident, that he plainly shewed, how greatly it did import France to make a voiage into Portugall: but they would not vn∣derstand, nor so much as giue eare vnto him: <HI>Thy destru∣ction is of thy selfe, O Israell.</HI> Is not this true? answer mee. <HI>Sub.</HI> I confesse it; there is nothing more true: and at Cam∣bray, Calice, and Amiens wee haue lost so much, as it is a mockery to speake of three millions, for that the moueables of Calice onely were worth more then a million, and those of Amiens much more. And if the enemy should happen to possesse those two places any long time, the game would soone cost vs more then 13. Millions. <HI>Pilg.</HI> Now then, if you confesse thus much, and doe know what the issue and effect of this matter wil be, as you say: why do you not that which concerneth you so much, and is so necessary for you? <HI>Sub.</HI> Seeing you doe presse mee so farre, I will tell you
<PB N="39" REF="26"/> without hiding any of our thoughts from you. The cause is, for that we are vnwilling to hazard and set vp the rest of our estates vpon the sayings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nota.</NOTE> and vpon the opinions of a Nation that is passionate and in miserie: but we hold it bet∣ter, to defend our owne as well as we may, rather then ex∣pose all to vtter ruine and destruction: for to what purpose will it be to send 12. or 15. thousand men into Spaine, where there is so great a multitude of people? We cannot beleeue that there can come so great good of such a iourny, as you in the beginning of your Treatise would perswade vs: and all the world doth both thinke and speake no lesse; affirming, that it is onely the desire of those (who are ty∣rannized and in bondage, and doe long to see their coun∣trey deliuered from that tyrannicall seruitude) which doth make all things to seeme and appeare easie to bee done. <HI>Pil.</HI> O that it would please God to open the eyes of your vnderstandings, that you might know your selues, and that you might be able to discerne the good from the ill, the sweet from the sower, and the blacke from white.

And in very truth, I doe assure you, that I hold it in a manner im∣possible for any man (be he neuer so sage, or quick &amp; cleere sighted) to perceiue the thousandth part of the griefe and sorow which I endure to see you (my masters) euen you of France and England so obstinate, as that you will nei∣ther conceiue, nor so much as vnderstand, that whereupon your whole saftetie and deliuerance doth depend: that you are so inclined to follow a tracke or by-path, which will throw you downe headlong to a most miserable ruine, out of which there will be no recouerie. But seeing I haue gai∣ned so little in speaking to you in particular, and that euery man doth talke of these matters in publike, I will now ther∣fore turne my speech to the whole world.</P>
<PB N="40" REF="27"/>
<P>First, I say, that it is very hard and difficult to put in exe∣cution any matter of great waight and importance, with∣out indangering of some things of like kinde and nature;<NOTE PLACE="marg">To gaine any thing there must be much hazarded.</NOTE> and a man cannot gaine or purchase any thing without some great hazard and aduenture. If Marchants should not aduenture their goods vpon the Seas, and commit them to the mercy of tempests and pyrats, or enemies, they would not make such great gaine and commoditie as we see them to do dayly: neither should Kings or Princes haue need of so many officers, or of so many customers: and the excessiue profit which men make both for themselues, as well as for their countrey would soone cease: neither would they so prodigally spēd &amp; bestow their goods &amp; their liues, in run∣ning into so many dangers for the discouering of Lands so farre scattered and remoued from them. If all this be done for the gaining of 10, 15, or 20, for 100, how much more ought you to doe it to redeeme and deliuer your selues from so great trouble and calamitie, and from so many dangers which doe threaten and menace you? And if you cast your your account well, you shall finde that you gaine more then 100 for one. Thus much concerning the first point of your speech. And whereas you spake of people passionate and in misery: I cannot forget it, but I must and will answer you to that point also. O how it would reioyce me, if you wold vnderstand, that this is but the malice of the deuill and his followers, to make men beleeue, that that which is told them (howsoeuer it be founded vpon truth and reason, and those aduertisements which are giuen them for their good and benefit (and which were needfull for them to receiue and imbrace) do proceed onely of passion: to the intent he may by meanes hereof hinder and withdraw them from all good actions, and bring them to vtter ruine and destru∣ction.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The condition of the assailāt farre differeth from that of the defendant.</NOTE></P>
<P>Secondly, it is most certaine, that the condition and estate of them which are defendants, is much more miserable then that of the assailants, because for to defend themselues they
<PB N="41" REF="27"/> shall need greater store of men and forces, then to assaile their enemies. The reason: for that those which stand vpon their defence, doe not know vpon what side the enemy will essault them: and they which do assaile, do well know where the enemy holdeth his principall force and strength for his defence. For example; suppose that the enemy put within <HI>Amiens</HI> 100. horse onely, and foure or 5000, foot: now for you to defend your selfe from them, it will be need∣full that you doe place good and strong garrisons in <HI>Abbe∣uille, Eeu, Diep, Roan, Gisors, Gournay, Pontoise, Beau∣mont, Senlis, Compeigne, Han, S.

And he might easily haue passed on much further, if his people had not died, who by reason of their disorder which they kept, and by their ill rule and demeaning of themselues, were oppressed with extreame famine, whereof ensued this plague and pestilence amongst them.

<P>The same King, before that he came to reigne, and after∣wards, had many victories vpon his enemies, no lesse admi∣rable then that other; insomuch, that a certaine Noble∣man of Castile being in speech one day, and deuising with
<PB N="48" REF="31"/> his King (which was the said <HI>John</HI>) he sayd vnto him: Sir, I cannot conceiue the cause why the King of Portugall, with so few men, hath so often vanquished you, seeing that you haue alwayes had fiue or six against one of them. The King answered him: The cause is, for that the King of Portugall doth fight against me, being accompanied with his chil∣dren, and I combat against him, being accompanied with my subiects; I am King and Lord of Castile, and hee is King and Lord of the Portugals.

<P>In the yeere following, on the fiue and twentieth of Iuly, being S. <HI>James</HI> his day, <HI>Scipio de Figueiredo de Ʋasconcelles,</HI> a Gentleman whose valour and fidelitie is well knowne, and of whom there is often mention made in Histories, being Gouernour of the Iles of Assores, hee defended him∣selfe in plaine field with lesse then foure hundred Portugals against more then a thousand Castillians, whom <HI>Don Petro de Valdes</HI> had made to take land in the Ile of Terceras, neere to the citie of Angra. The Portugals were no souldiers, but mechanicall persons, handycrafts men, and labourers, and amongst them, there were not ten Gentlemen; for the Gouernour had left them in the Towne, for the defence and gouernment thereof. The Castillians were old souldi∣ers, amongst whom (as is reported) there were two hun∣dred men who had beene Commanders in Armies of Ca∣stile, and they fought from foure houres after morning, till foure of the night: at which time they caused a great quan∣titie of Kine to be driuen downe from the Mountaines,

The famous <HI>Conestagio</HI> doth recount this Historie otherwise, but falsely; howbeit, that hee confesseth, that there were slaine sixe hundred Castil∣lians, and thirtie Portugals. But I haue heard what passed in this encounter, of many Gentlemen Spaniards, my coun∣treymen, who were present at it, and especially of one that was borne in Valentia, named <HI>Don Gasper,</HI> who saued him∣selfe by Sea, being sore hurt; and of a Drumme, that was a Castillian; and of a Portugall, borne in Villa Vicosa: the which two onely had their liues saued, being found vpon the Sea-shore, after the heat of the fight was past. There died one of the nephewes of the Duke <HI>de Alua,</HI> and one of the nephewes of the Marquesse <HI>de Santa Cruce,</HI> and a nephew of the aboue-named <HI>Don Pedro de Valdes,</HI> and that renowned <HI>Philip Hartada,</HI> an Arragonnois, and seuentie more, of such as were the eldest brethren of sundry good Houses; of whom, a good part were neere neighbours to Salamanca. To be briefe, there died all the flower of Castile: for that they seeing how Portugall was yeelded vnto them so easily, and hauing heard that the Iles were very rich, and that the East Indie Fleet was like to fall into their hands, and being allured with the late sacke of the suburbes of Lisbon, which was valued at three Millions; they had embarked themselues for this seruice as cheere∣fully, as if they had beene going to a Wedding. This is a thing well knowne, that foure or fiue young Portugals, from betweene eighteene and twentie yeeres of age, did at Lisbon, with their Swords and Cloakes onely, make no account of a dozen of Castillians. By these reasons men
<PB N="50" REF="32"/> may vnderstand, that that which <HI>Walsingham</HI> sayth, is not a ridiculous thing, much lesse a Brauado. But returne wee to that wee had in hand.</P>
<P>Within a few dayes after, there came certaine Embassa∣dours to the Duke of Lancaster, sent from the King of Ca∣stile, who in all humilitie did demaund to haue peace; but the Duke would not hearken vnto them. Notwithstan∣ding, hunger and the pestilence constraining him to retyre into Portugall, to the Towne of Trancoso, they came againe to seeke him out, being sent thither vnto him the second time by the said <HI>John,</HI> King of Castile, with their former re∣quest; shewing vnto the Duke by many good reasons and arguments, the great profit which would ensue of a good peace made betweene them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Castilian demandeth peace of the Duke of Lan∣caster in all humilitie.</NOTE> Thereupon did the Duke giue them audience, and in the end did accord to their demand, howbeit that it was full sore against his will: First, be∣cause he was giuen to vnderstand, that the King of Portu∣gall was willing to haue it so: And secondly (which in effect was the thing that did most vrge him) because he was aduertised, that the troubles and warres began afresh betweene the French and the English, and that there were certaine Seditions growne in England, by reason whereof hee should not be able to haue any fresh succours from thence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Castilian constrained to receiue condi∣tions to his disaduantage.</NOTE> whereof it seemed he had then great want; and the mortalitie which was in his Armie did now threaten him, that hee should haue need of a further supply. The accord therefore was made betweene the King and the Duke in this sort: That <HI>Henry,</HI> the eldest sonne of <HI>Iohn,</HI> named Prince of Castile, should espouse <HI>Katherine,</HI> the onely daughter of the said Duke, and of <HI>Constance</HI> his wife; and that they two should succeed in the Realmes of Castile and Leon, and other his Seigniories: That the King should endow both the Mother and the Daughter (as he did) giuing to the Mother the Citie of Guadalaiara, Medina del Cam∣po, and Ouiedo; and afterwards, being with her in the said Towne of Medina, he gaue her Hueta also: and to the daugh∣ter
<PB N="51" REF="32"/> for her Dowrie, hee gaue the Esturies, making and na∣ming her Princesse, and his sonne Prince of Esturie. And from that time forward, the eldest sonne of the Castillian King hath alwayes borne and had the surname of this Prin∣cipalitie, as of Dauphine in France the Dolphin. Besides it was couenanted, That he should giue vnto the Duke sixe hundred thousand Franks of Gold, for his returne into Eng∣land, and fortie thousand Franks of yeerely rent, during the liues of him and his wife. <HI>Iohn</HI> of Castile accepted all these conditions, and that very gladly: for albeit he had France, and the Frenchmen also on his side, and the King of Arra∣gon likewise (with whose sister hee had beene marryed, of whom was borne the said Prince <HI>Don Henry</HI> and <HI>Fernand,</HI> who was afterward king of Arragon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Spaine with the suc∣cors of France against Portu∣gal, which gai∣ned notwith∣standing.</NOTE> against all right and equitie, and to the preiudice of the true and lawfull heires:) and had also <HI>Charles</HI> the third king of Nauarre to his friend: yet he knew neuerthelesse that hauing ciuill warres in his owne Realme, and Portugall his enemy: hee should hazard the fortune of all his estates and dominions, of such power was the Realme of Portugall against all the rest of Spaine.

And those of the Duke had beene much more to his profit and aduantage in this accord, if the king of Portugall had been willing thereunto: because he hauing the sword in his owne hand, hee might haue made partition of the countrey at his owne will and pleasure: he was the iudge, and did what seemed good in his owne sight.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plutarch in Apothege.</NOTE> Hee that hath the sword may deuide the lands as he listeth.

<P>This is a thing most certaine and assured, and the Por∣tugals do so regard their hononur, and they are so ambitious of
<PB N="55" REF="34"/> the same, and it is so recommended vnto them from the fa∣ther to the sonne: that if they should lose but one iot thereof, they would grow starke mad, as men that had lost all sense and vnderstanding.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fernand Ma∣gellan his great impati∣ency and folly.</NOTE> <HI>Fernand de Magellan</HI> a Gentleman of Portugall, vpon an opinion that his King had done him much wrong, did conceiue such a despight thereof, that he fled from Portugall, and retired himselfe to the King of Castile, purposing to discouer vnto him the enterprise of Peru. Now see the folly, or rather madnesse of the man; his discontent∣ment proceeded of no other matter but of this: for that the King had denied to giue him a pension onely of halfe a Duckat monethly for his sonne: for the custome of Portugall is, that all the Gentlemen shall take a pension (which they call <HI>Mo∣radia</HI>) of the King, according to the degrees and qualities of their Nobilities, (which they doe properly call <HI>Fuero:</HI>) and they are to bee enrolled in the bookes of the Kings house, which they call the Booke of the Kitchin, or the Booke of Ma∣triculation. The qualitie of <HI>Magellan</HI> was to bee one of the Knights of <HI>Hidalgo</HI> (that is to say) <HI>Feal,</HI> or one that doth Fealtie: his pension was euery moneth three Duckats: and hee had a petition to the king, that his sonne might be admitted in∣to the same qualitie as himselfe was, and that he might haue the like pension. Of these demands the King granted the one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The reason why Magel∣lan did disco- the enterprise of Peru to the king of Castile</NOTE> and refused the other: for he accepted his sonne for one of his Knights <HI>Feal:</HI> but hee would not giue any more then two Duckats and a halfe for his pension, obseruing therein the custome of his predecessours, who did not vse to giue to the children so great a pension as to the fathers saue onely when by the death of their parents they came to succeede them in their inheritance. And for as much as in Portugall the manner is, that the Nobles haue their place and precedence according to the degree and qualitie of their Nobilitie: and they which are of one like degree and qualitie, doe take their place each of other according to the quantitie of the ponsion, more or lesse, which they receiue. <HI>Magellan</HI> did take in so euill part this refusall of the King, made vnto
<PB N="56" REF="35"/> his sonne of halfe this duckat, onely because by meanes hereof he should lose his precedence, that he became most foolishly enra∣ged, as a man that had lost all sense and vnderstanding: and to shew the extreme griefe and sorrow which he tooke for the losse of so small an honour, he purchased to himselfe the name and estimation of a Traitor, and for such a one doe all histories re∣count him: because he did not performe that du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie and deuoire to his king which he ought him, but did giue it vnto a stran∣ger: and he was the occasion that things came to that passe, that the two realmes of Portugall and Castile, were vpon the point to haue fallen at variance each with other. So that it was the extreme and ambitious desire of honour which made <HI>Ma∣gellan</HI> thus mad, and will worke the like effect with all true Portugals: and it was not the desire of getting a little piece of money, as some haue taken it, and haue not been ashamed to set downe as much in writing, for the matter and subiect in∣cident hereunto doe shew the contrary.

And this we shall see cleerely by demon∣stration, if we make the said Figure quadrant in France of 5. degrees and in length, and 40. leagues in bredth: the forme thereof will bee thus: Draw a line from the Angle on the East side of the quadrant and where it hath the North at the head; and it will begin at Crotoy vpon the riuer of Somme (which is in 50. degrees of eleuation) e∣uen to Lybourne in Perigort (which is 44. degrees and a halfe) passing neere by Roan, by Eureux, Dreux, and Am∣boise, neere by Chastellerauld, by Coue, and betweene Ne∣gre and Iarnac and Angolesme, and between Barbesieux &amp; Coutras, till you come to the sayd towne of Libourne: All that countrey which is in the West of this figure, is as great as Portugall.

The quadrant which hath his head towards the North, and beginneth in the East at Crotoy, drawing toward the West, endeth in the Sea, a∣bout 6. leagues off the Sea coast of Cherebourg, and so pas∣sing by Constance and by Graundville neere the towne of Dol by the villages of Becherel, Redon, and Arebon, and entring into the Sea betweene Guerrand and Croisic, euen to 44. degrees and a halfe, to the East of the sayd towne of Libourne 10. leagues from the land, which is to the South of Anchises: wee shall come to haue our Figure perfect. Moreouer, because there may be no doubt in this demon∣stration, we will answer to an obiection which may bee made by those which will not that Portugall should bee greater then Normandie, and that is, seeing the line from the west side of our Figure passeth by Cherebourg, Constance, <MILESTONE UNIT="Obiections."/> &amp;c. so as it commeth into the Sea betweene Guerrand and Croisic; what shall be done with the land which remaineth, which is a little part of Normandy, and endeth neere the Ifle of Alderney, and from thence alongst the greatest part of Brittaine? Whereunto I answer, <MILESTONE UNIT="Answer."/> that
<PB N="67" REF="40"/> all this land, and all the countrey which remaineth there, may be put within the West Angles of the Figure, which are voyd, because they end within the Sea. Now this de∣monstration being well made and vnderstood, and being compared with the greatnesse of Portugall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Portugall as great as Eng∣land.</NOTE> we shall finde that her circuit is not only as great as all these Prouinces of France, which we haue spoken of, but euen as great as all that circuit which is comprehended in the Isle of great Brittaine, which we call England.</P>
<P>As touching the fertilitie of Portugall, a man may easily iudge thereof by that which <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth of it speaking of <HI>Lusitania,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The fertilitie of Portugall.

And the Prouinces and lands which the Portugals possesse in Spaine out of <HI>Lusitania,</HI> are held to be much more fertile, then those of <HI>Lusitania</HI> it selfe: as the lands which they hold in <HI>Boetica,</HI> in the Prouince <HI>Tronsmontana,</HI> (which the common people call <HI>Tras los Montes</HI>) and in the Prouince betweene <HI>Duero</HI> and <HI>Mig∣no,</HI> which the Latines named <HI>Interamnis,</HI> and which (the sayd <HI>Strabo</HI>) against the common and true opinion, pla∣ceth within <HI>Lusitania.</HI> And he sayth further; in <HI>Lusitania</HI> is the riuer Lethe which many call <HI>Limaea,</HI> and some others <HI>Belion:</HI> wherein he is deceiued; as also in saying that <HI>Mi∣nius</HI> surpasseth all the riuers of <HI>Lusitania</HI> in greatnesse: for Lyme is shut in within the Prouince that lieth betweene <HI>Duero</HI> and <HI>Migno:</HI> which Prouinces (following the true description, are enclosed in the Prouince of <HI>Taragon:</HI> and <HI>Migno</HI> is much lesse then <HI>Duero, Tago,</HI> and <HI>Guadiana,</HI> which are in <HI>Lusitania.</HI></P>

The countrey for the greatnesse thereof is well peopled: the Duke of <HI>Bragantia</HI> alone in one Cittie, and in the Townes,

<P>It is not vnknowne to the whole world, that in the time of <HI>Sebastian</HI> king of Portugall, there were throughout all that realme 1200. companies of footmen, in the which there were none enrolled nor mustered, but onely the peo∣ple of that countrey, Artizans, handicrafts-men, and such like mechanicall persons and laborers, and yet not all of them: the Noblemen, Gentlemen, officers of iustice: the the gouernours of cities and townes: the students and such as professed learning: in sum, all the Nobilitie, the Ecclesia∣sticall and regular persons, with their seruants, and many other sorts of men priuiledged were excused and exempted, and were not bound to enroll themselues in the sayd Com∣panies: of which the most part consisted of 200 men, some of 300.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The number of men fit for warre in Por∣tugall.</NOTE> and of 400. Let vs allow to each of them 200 men onely, and they will amount to the number of 240000 men. Consider then how great the number may be of them, which were not bound to be enroled in those Companies. I doe not here make any mention of the number of compa∣nies of Horsemen, of which this Realme hath a great quan∣tity, because it is not possible to know the certainty and truth thereof.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The greatnes of the king of Portugall.</NOTE>Moreouer the Kings of Portugall are so great in one re∣spect, that therein they exceede all the Kings and Princes of Europe, and that is, that they are able in lesse then a quar∣ter of an houre to giue vnto their vassals and subiects 10

<P>Hereby may a man easily iudge the greatnesse, the riches, and the puissance of this Realme, whereunto adding the seigniories which it hath and possesseth in Affrike, Asia and America, and in the Ilands which it holdeth in the Ocean Sea, it maketh a most notable, great and puissant Monar∣chy: and therefore I maruell not though the King of Castile doth commit such excesse, and is at so great costs and expen∣ces for the keeping and preseruing of the same: he knoweth full well how much it importeth him, and of what value and worth it is vnto him: he is not ignorant, as one that knoweth not the estate of things, but on the contrary rather he is wise, aduised, very politike, and well experienced in affaires and matters of state.</P>

So hath he tyrannized, and doth yet still tyrannize ouer the ho∣nour of the Arragonnois, the Catalans, the Valentians, the Nauarrois, and other the Nations of Spaine: and onely his Castilians (which cary the name of Spaniards, and are so called by those that are ignorant, and know not the diffe∣rence that is between the seuerall Nations of Spaine,) they (I say) are those Lyons, those Tygers, and conquerours of the World. But we will come to the conclusion of this part of our Treatise touching Portugall, the most precious and chiefest pearle of his Crowne. It was my chance to be one day in his company with a personage of great estate, who is daily at great charges, and doth spend good store of duc∣kats to haue notice and intelligence of that which passeth abroad in the World: and hee did assure me for a certaine and vndoubted truth, that one of the greatest fauourites of the King of Castile did demand of him this question:<Q REND="margQuotes">What

<P>Philip <HI>seeing himselfe Lord of so great a Monarchy, doth aspire by all meanes he may to the Realmes of France and of England, and of other Prouinces: and hee doth reape so great contentment in his ambitious thoughts and purposes, that hee cannot but discouer his conceit in that behalfe: insomuch that not onely they of his Councell, but his particular priuate Soul∣diers doe know it.

And if it had beene true, that these two
<PB N="79" REF="46"/> sisters had no right in the said realmes, because hee alledged them to be bastards: by the same reason, had the sayd <HI>Hen∣rie</HI> much lesse right and interest in them: for he was not on∣ly a bastard, but murtherer also of his owne brother. And in such like case was <HI>Fernand</HI> King of Portugall the great grand child of <HI>Sancho</HI> aboue named, right inheritor to the said realmes; as was the king <HI>Don Peter</HI> his cousine german remoued, and cousin german also: for <HI>Beatrix</HI> the mother of <HI>Peter,</HI> was the sister of <HI>Peter</HI> the father of <HI>Fernand.</HI> For this cause <HI>Samora, Toco, Cindad-Rodrigo,</HI> and other citties and townes of the realmes of Castile and Leon, did call in the said <HI>Fernand,</HI> and offered to receiue him for their king: especially the realme of <HI>Galitia,</HI> which was wholly resol∣ued to render it selfe vnto him.

For they did purposely oppose themselues against the desire and will of their King, for two reasons: the first was, because they had good tryall and experience, that there wanted much of that valour in <HI>Fernand,</HI> which was in the father and his auncestors: the second was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Portu∣gals haue an ill opinion of the Castilians.</NOTE> because the Castilian Nation is so maligne and peruerse (as the Portugals doe hold it for a <HI>maxime</HI> among themselues) that it is dange∣rous to haue any thing to doe with them, yea to haue any command ouer them, as hath beene before touched.

<P>In the yeare 1474. after the death of <HI>Henrie</HI> the fourth king of Castile, <HI>Jsabel</HI> the sister, the wife of <HI>Fernand</HI> king of Arragon, did most tyrannically get possession of the Realmes of Castile and Leon, and of their other Seignio∣ries, excluding <HI>Jane</HI> the daughter of the sayd <HI>Henrie</HI> her brother: who in the yeare 1461. had been acknowledged Princesse and inheritrix of the said Realmes, for default of heire males, in a full assembly of the three estates, which were assembled to that end at Madrill, by the commande∣ment of her father. And the first persons which tooke the oath of fidelitie, and did so acknowledge her, were the in∣fant <HI>Don Alpho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sus,</HI> and the sayd <HI>Isabel,</HI> the brother and sister of the sayd king: after whom all the residue did the like, euery one in order according to their degrees. And af∣ter that shee was againe the second time acknowledged Princesse and heire of the sayd Realmes in <HI>Ʋal-de-Loçoia,</HI> after diligent enquiry made vpon the legittimation of the sayd Princesse, which was done by the Cardinall <HI>de Alby</HI> a Frenchman, who to that effect was come into Castile by the commandement of King <HI>Lewes</HI> the eleuenth of France: the which Cardinal in the presence of all the Princes and Lords of the Realme, hauing caused the mother to be sworne and take her oath, demanded of her, if the Princesse <HI>Dame Jane</HI> her daughter, were the daughter of the King her hus∣band: whereunto shee answered vpon her oath, that shee was. Secondly, the King (which tooke the same oath, and) protested that he did fully beleeue and assure himselfe, that this infant <HI>Dame Jane</HI> was his daughter, and that in all cer∣taintie hee had continually so taken and reputed her euer since she was borne: and therefore he did wil and command that the oath of fidelitie and obeysance, which was vsually accustomed to be taken in his Realmes and Dominions, as due to the eldest of the Kings children,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guarib. lib. 17. cap. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> should be made vn∣to her. These are the very words of <HI>Steuen Guaribay: Hie∣rome Surite</HI> (who is yet liuing) doth rehearse this historie very plainely and distinctly in his generall history of Spain,
<PB N="81" REF="47"/> and how <HI>Henrie</HI> being ready to yeeld vp the Ghost,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hierome Su∣rite in the ge∣nerall historie of Spaine.</NOTE> did euen then maintaine, that the said <HI>Iane</HI> was his daughter and that he commanded his Confessor openly to reuale it. And the said <HI>Guaribay</HI> affirmeth that <HI>Henrie</HI> did confesse himselfe the space of a good hower, before his soule de∣parted from his body, and that he being in good and per∣fect quietnesse of sense, and of a sound and good memory, after he had named the executors of his last will and testa∣ment, and declared them for the Gouernors of this Realm, and had giuen commandement, that his seruants should be payd out of his treasures and iewels, he named the said Princesse <HI>Iaene,</HI> for the vniuersall heire of all his Realmes and dominions, calling her by the name of his daughter, and recommending her with all his affection to the sayd Gouernours.</P>
<P>By that which hath beene sayd, appeareth clearely, that the Realme of Castile, in lesse then 258. yeares hath beene tyrannized foure times, and that of Leon thrice, and all the other Realmes and Seigniories likewise, which are dependants of the same: the which the king <HI>Philip</HI> pos∣sesseth euen at this present day by a most vniust, wrongfull and tyrannicall title.</P>
<P>This also is one thing worthy to bee marked, and (which may be seene by the histories both of the same authours, and of diuers others) namely, that when there hath hap∣pened any difference or disagreement vpon the sayd suc∣cession, they which haue beene in possession, haue al∣together preuayled, and made their title, euen by the right of those very parties whom they haue dispossessed: which is the greatest tyranny that can bee. And that this may the better be perceiued, I will alledge onely two ex∣amples.</P>
<P><HI>Rodrigo Sanches</HI> Bishop of Palance recounteth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the life of Iohn the first king of Castile</NOTE> how <HI>Iohn</HI> the first King of Castile and Leon (of whom wee haue before spoken) seeing that <HI>John</HI> of Gaunt Duke of Lancaster, pretended the sayd Realmes of Castile and of
<PB N="82" REF="48"/> Leon to appertaine vnto him, for the reason heretofore alledged; hee said in defence of his claime, that the sayd Realmes did of right belong vnto him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cunning of Iohn the first king of Castile.</NOTE> as being the sonne of <HI>Iane</HI> and the Grand-child of <HI>Don Iuan Emanuel</HI> and of his wife, who was the daughter of <HI>Fernand de la Cerda,</HI> the lawfull heire of the sayd Realmes: because his brother <HI>Alphonsus</HI> was deceased without children, and that for this cause hee did hold them with a good conscience, and that he did not hold them from his father, whom himselfe confessed to be a bastard.</P>
<P>The other example is like vnto the former. For in a great assembly of Princes, Lords, and other principall persona∣ges, held in the towne of Trogillo, for the taking of the oath of fidelitie to <HI>Fernand</HI> the second king of Arragon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The policy of Fernand the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>econd King of Arragon, &amp;c.</NOTE> and <HI>Isabel</HI> his wise Queene of Castile, the sayd <HI>Fernand</HI> pre∣tended that hee had more right of himselfe, then the sayd <HI>Isabel,</HI> and that hee ought to be acknowledged as the true and principall heire of the sayd Realmes of Castile and Leon, not as husband to the said <HI>Isabel,</HI> but as discending in the right and lawfull line male of the kings his prede∣cessors, because hee was the sonne of <HI>John</HI> the grand-child of <HI>Fernand,</HI> and the great grand-child of <HI>Iohn</HI> the first: who on the side of his mother same <HI>Iane</HI> the grand daughter of <HI>Fernand de la Cerda</HI> (as hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eene sayd) was the true and rightfull heire of the said Realmes. <HI>Jsabel</HI> knowing the intent and ambition of <HI>Fernand</HI> her husband, resol∣ued to bend and employ all her force and puissance for the maintaining of her right: and for a reply to his speech she said: That that which hee had spoken was to bee gran∣ted, if women had not beene vsually admitted to the suc∣cession of those Realmes: but seeing the custome was to the contrary, therefore her said husband ought not to bee pre∣ferred: and for proofe of that which she sayd, she named certaine women which had succeeded to the said crownes: amongst others <HI>Katherine</HI> the daughter of <HI>Constance,</HI> and of <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Gaunt</HI> Duke of Lancaster aboue mentioned,
<PB N="83" REF="48"/> where she did assure her selfe had beene admitted, and re∣ceiued to that inheritance as the grand-daughter of her graund-father <HI>Peter,</HI> and that <HI>Henrie</HI> the husband of the said <HI>Katherine,</HI> her ancestors, had right thereunto onely by meane of the said <HI>Katherine</HI> his wife. For these reasons <HI>Jsabel</HI> was preferred before <HI>Fernand,</HI> and she was acknow∣ledged as the true heire of the said Realmes of Castile and Leon, and he reputed to haue right onely as her husband and companion, and not otherwise. And this is it which <HI>Marin Sicilian</HI> speaketh of.

</DIV1></BODY></TEXT></Q>
<P>So that herein may bee seene most apparantly, the no∣table tyranny of the predecessors of the king Catholike now raigning: who, after they had for a while suppressed the right of others, to the intent themselues might tyranize ouer those Realmes: yet would afterwards seeke againe to reuiue, and to retaine that very right, and title which they had before most iniuriously vsurped. A thing certainly, which may induce vs rather to sigh and to lament, then to conceiue any pleasure and delight, to see the Princes of the earth, which beare the name and title of Catho∣lickes, to bee neuerthelesse so bad Christians, and so insupportable tyrants, as is this <HI>Philip</HI> the King of Castile. Which is the cause that all the Ecclesiasticall and regular persons of Portugall doe hate him so extremely, that when the commandement was giuen them, that in certaine of their prayers, and in their Canonicall houres, they should expressely pronounce the name <HI>Philip</HI> (for the King knew well, that vnder the name of King vsed indetermi∣nately, they did in their hearts vnderstand and pray for <HI>Don Anthonio.</HI>) They tooke his commandement in so ill part, that they could not bee brought to doe it. But in the end they seeing themselues pressed by the commandement of the Bishops and Prelates, they did at length pronounce his name, but with such disdaine and in dignitie, as I am ashamed to speake it: notwithstanding because these matters doe well concurre together, and it is not from
<PB N="85" REF="49"/> our purpose; and besides, because hee that shall rehearse them, is not to be blamed for the reciting, for that hee is bound to represent them onely in manner and forme as they were done, I haue determined to recount vnto you two examples concerning this matter, of the which we doe now intreat.</P>
<P>The Archbishop of Lisbon hauing giuen out and pub∣lished the Kings commandement afore mentioned, through out all the Churches of Lisbon, in the yeere 1582. the first of Ianuary: vpon the day of the three Kings next ensuing, a certaine Curate, as he was saying a solemne Masse in his Parish Church, with great pompe and solemnity, and the Church full of people, when hee came to the end of the prayer which is vsually said after <HI>Gloria in excelsis:</HI> in sing∣ing of these words, <HI>Et Famulum tuum regem nostrum</HI> (that is) thy seruant our King; he suddenly stopped, and turning himselfe towards the Deacon and Subdeacon, he spake vn∣to them with loud voyce. Tell me, tell me, how call you this Diuell: And they answering him, <HI>Philip,</HI> he named <HI>Philip,</HI> and so went on with his Masse.</P>
<P>At the same time it happened that a religious person of the order of S. <HI>Dominicke,</HI> making mention of the King in a certaine prayer, without naming him by his name of <HI>Phi∣lip,</HI> and being commanded by his Prelate, vnder paine of contempt and disobedience, that he should name him by his proper name: he then repeated it, saying; <HI>Et Famulum tuum regem nostrum Philippum, Ducem Albensem, Sanchum de Auila &amp; Rodericum Sapata, caeterósque omnes diabolos, &amp;c.</HI> That is to say: And thy seruant our King <HI>Philip,</HI> the Duke <HI>de Alua, Sancho de Auila,</HI> and <HI>Rodericke Sapata,</HI> and all the other Diuels. When I rehearsed this vnto a No∣bleman of good account, with whom I communicated the greatest part of this discourse, hee wondered greatly, vsing this exclamation; Iesu, doe the Priests and Religious per∣sons of Portugall thus hate his Catholike Maiesty? This is a strange thing, and I maruell much that they hating him so
<PB N="86" REF="50"/> extreamely, and being of such strength and puissance in their Countrey, (for the most part of them are Noblemen and Gentlemen, and some of them great Princes) that they doe not cause the people to rise in armes against that Ty∣rant. I answered him, the cause is, for that albeit they haue neuer so iust a cause to take armes, yet the Portugals are a people of great patience and sufferance towards their Prince: and they doe also goe to the warres with so ill a will, (howbeit, that being once in the warres, they proue very good Souldiers) that they had rather goe to hanging. Neuerthelesse, if they should once rise against the Castilian, they would defend themselues in such manner, that hee should neuer more be able to suppresse them.</P>
<P>The whole substance of the matter is: that they doe once grow to a resolution, and that they set hand to the worke: which if they once doe, I beleeue that they will make as great a wall betweene Portugall and Castile, as they of China did in times past make betweene them and the Tar∣tarians: and if it were but onely to content the soule of their King <HI>Iohn</HI> the second,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iohn</HI> the 2. the scourge of the Castilians, named, The man and King of peace.</NOTE> named, <HI>The man and King of peace,</HI> who was the scourge and plague of the Castilians: and of him is yet spoken that old prouerbe; <HI>Jf the Chicke had not come, the Cocke had beene taken.</HI> This Prince knowing the manners, the life, and the tyrannicall actions of the Casti∣lian, was wont to say, that hee did greatly desire to see be∣tweene Portugall and Castile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The griefe and discōtentment of King <HI>Iohn</HI> the 2. of Por∣tugall.</NOTE> a wall feared vp so high, as might reach vp to Heauen; protesting, that the thing that most grieued him in this World, was: for that the Sunne did first passe by Castile, before it came into Portugall: and that which made him quite and cleane out of all patience, was, because he knew not how to remedy it.</P>
<P>The Nobleman, to whom I recounted all these things, giuing me great thankes, said vnto me: Certainely I am ve∣ry glad, and doe thanke you heartily for acquainting me with these particulars, which are things worthy to be re∣membred, and such as I haue not at any time heard or seene
<PB N="87" REF="50"/> written. But I doe not vnderstand (quoth he) what should be meant by that prouerbe aboue mentioned: <HI>If the Chicke had not come, the Cocke had beene taken:</HI> as that also which you haue spoken of the loyalty of <HI>Auila</HI> and <HI>Simancas</HI> in Castile: of <HI>Celorico</HI> and of the Castle of Coimbre in Por∣tugall: and of the King of Castile and the Castilians, and of the Cities and Townes. <HI>Monsieur</HI> (quoth I againe) I would gladly declare the same vnto you, but I feare lest I be blamed for making such long digressions: for I am so well acquainted with the disposition of men, that I am not ignorant in how many parts of this my discourse, they may accuse me in that behal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e: and therefore I pray you to suffer me first to make an end, and then after the conclusion of this Treatise, I will satisfie your desire particularly and at good leysure: for I doe assure you, I would keepe silence concer∣ning many things in this worke, were it not most requisite and needfull that they should be spoken of and published, for the better attaining to that which I intend and purpose; the which (I doe perswade my selfe) that both you my ma∣sters of England and likewise of France, and you also my masters the Princes of Europe (who are all of you highly interessed in the greatnesse of the Castilian) will embrace cheerefully, and with open armes, if you be not altogether without iudgement and vnderstanding. But it is now meet, that we pursue the proofe and demonstration of the tyran∣ny of King <HI>Philip,</HI> which calleth himselfe the King Catho∣like.</P>
<P>We haue lately shewed, how King <HI>Philip</HI> by vsurpation and tyranny, <HI>non solum in modo, sed in genere,</HI> (as the Ciuilians vse to speake) of his predecessors, doth possesse the Realmes of Castile, of Leon, of Galicia, of Tole∣do, of Siuill, of Cordona, of Murcia, &amp;c. with some other Prouinces contained within the precincts and streights of his Realme.

<P>Behold then how hee dispatcheth all his affaires, and in what manner hee dealeth with all the world. It was not long since there was taken in the Citie of Leon a pac∣ket of letters, written with his owne hand, and sent
<PB N="95" REF="54"/> to the Constable of Castile, within the which were found certaine graines amongst the letters: and a certaine Gen∣tleman suspecting somewhat, gaue of those graines to eate to manie liuing creatures, which all died immedi∣atlie. Another like matter as this same happened within a while after in the franke Countie of Burgoigne, in a certaine house where the Constable of Castile had lodged; after his departure from thence, a chamber-maide of the house founde a ball within a verie faire purse; with∣in which ball shee thinking to haue founde some great treasure, founde certaine graines, of which was made the same proofe and experience: and all those creatures that did eate thereof, died. This is that notable ty∣rant which doeth all that hee can doe, to the vttermost of his abilitie, and that dareth seeke to take away the life of the most Christian Maiestie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To wit, of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Queene of England, and Prince Mau∣rice Count of Nassau, &amp;c, Fol 216. p. 2. 80000. duc∣kats promised by king Phi∣lip to kill Don Anthonio</NOTE> and other Princes by such shamefull and abhominable meanes, as there is none but would shame to write them, saue onelie maister <HI>Hieronyme Franchi Conestagio,</HI> of whome wee haue formerlie spoken. For hee in the seuenth booke of his historie saieth, that <HI>Philip</HI> did prize the life of the Priour (that is to say, of Seigniour <HI>Don Anthonio</HI> king of Portugall) at fourescore thousand duckats, as beeing a rebell and disturber of the publike peace and quietnesse. And so did hee handle another Prince that was both his cousin germane, and cousin germane remo∣ued, and so manie wayes of kinne vnto him, and so strict∣ly allied vnto him in friendship and amitie, that they carried themselues each to other, as if they had bene each others father; yea, and as if they had bene but one person: and yet did hee vse him as if hee had bene a com∣mon theefe, a robber, a malefactor, and a man of no rec∣kening nor estimation. And this horrible and abhominable crueltie doeth not end in Portugall, but it passeth ouer the sea, and the Pyrenean mountaines, into Fraunce, and into England; where he hath bent and imployed all his meanes
<PB N="96" REF="55"/> to take away the liues of the Monarches of those realmes. O barbarous, O abhominable hang-man and murtherer! hast thou no shame? If thou be a Catholike, as thou doest entitle thy selfe, how is it, that thou knowest not what a deede of shame and enormitie it is to commit murther? God would not that any man should touch <HI>Caine</HI> himselfe, who had murthered his owne brother: and commanded that if any were so hardy as to kill him, that he should bee seuerely punished:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Genes. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Omnis qui occiderit Caine, septuplum pu∣nietur,</HI> Whosoeuer shall kill <HI>Caine,</HI> shall be punished seuen sold.

<P>By this then that hath beene said, may bee seene, as in a mirrour, the crueltie of this maligne and peruerse tyrant,
<PB N="97" REF="55"/> whome many will not beleeue to bee such a one as in very deede and in trueth he is: but contrariewise, without all consideration, as people blinded, peruerse, and obstinate, they will striue and contend to gratifie him, be it well or ill done. And that which doth make me most out of patience in this behalfe, is to see and heare some, who moued with an indiscreet zeale: or els being wickedly enclined, and (it may bee) guided and seduced by the diuell, doe hold any man whomsoeuer a most lewd and vile man, and in manner of an heretike, who being drawne by a true and iust zeale, shall publish this much for a trueth and certaintie: in so much, that whether it be for feare or for gaine, or for hatred, or of a disordinate loue and charitie, they doe esteeme it a farre worser deede to accuse and to reproue such open &amp; knowne iniquities, then the very act of doing them. All of you in a manner will confesse and can not denie, but that all this which hath bene spoken touching the malice of this tyrant is most true and certaine: and yet neuerthelesse, they them∣selues will not for all that stick to say, that notwithstanding it be so, yet it is ill done, so to report of a Prince, that is so great a Catholike.

But you will say vnto me; that there is reason Princes should bee excused in some faultes, when they are otherwise endowed with any no∣table and excellent vertues. And that there did neuer reigne in Spaine any Prince, which hath giuen bett<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r triall,
<PB N="98" REF="56"/> nor made such euident demonstration of him selfe to bee a good Catholike, as his Catholike Maiestie, of whome now wee are in question. There is no Prince that hath so much enlarged, and augmented the Ca∣tholike faith as hee. There was neuer any that did vse the Clergie, and all, both Ecclesiasticall and Re∣gular persons with greater loue, nor greater reuerence. And in briefe, there is not any hath builded more Mo∣nasteries, nor edified so many Churches, nor exerci∣sed so great bountie and liberalitie towards the Church as he hath done; for besides the great and excessiue costs and expences which hee hath bene at in building them, hee hath founded them with most great and rich rents and reuenues, and hath honoured them with most am∣ple and beneficiall priuiledges. This is well said. Be∣leeue me my maisters, I am infinitely sorrie, that I may not briefely aunswer to these propositions, for that eue∣rie one of them doeth require a more ample treatise then this worke which wee haue in hand: neuerthelesse, I will not leaue by the way (as it were) to say something touching the same,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An answer to the former ob∣iections, or al∣legations.</NOTE> and to shewe you how you doe abuse your selues in all these matters. And first, to aunswer to the former of your allegations; I confesse that you say nothing but reason: when a Prince shalbe a good Catho∣liste, iust, honest, and valiant, without being liberall: it is great reason he should be pardoned of this defect; and so doe I thinke also, when any of those vertues shalbe wan∣ting in a Prince, which are conuenient and fit for the royall person and dignitie: so as notwithstanding he be furnished and adorned with the residue. Howbeit I doe not forget what the commaundement of God is, touching this point: <HI>Quicunque totam legem seruauerit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iames. 2. v. 10.</NOTE> <HI>in vno autem offenderit, factus est omnium reus:</HI> whosoeuer shall keepe the whole law, and yet faileth in one point, he is guiltie of all. But I speake now as touching man, and in respect of men onely, and not of God: and I am of this opinion, that if a Prince
<PB N="99" REF="56"/> be touched with some notable vice: as if he be vniust, or cruell, or a tyrant, or an ill or loose liuer, &amp;c. yet being accompanied and furnished with other vertues, we ought not neuerthelesse, for any one of those vices aboue men∣tioned, (how great and haynous so euer it be) neither to reuolt from him, nor yet so to complot or conspire a∣gainst him, as to procure his ruine and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>struction (for as∣much as in seeking his ruine, we shall sooner finde our own, which Fraunce hath w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooued of to her cost.) But we are bound to haue our recourse to God, by hartie prayer, fa∣sting, and abstinence, and to pray to his diuine Maiestie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Good and wholesome counsel for the demeanor of subiects to∣wards their Princes.</NOTE> to turne his mercie toward him, and to pardon him, and to giue him grace and vnderstanding to auoide that which is euill, and iudgement and wisedoome, to choose that which is good: that hee would giue him a concrite and humble heart, and would deale with him according to his mercies, to the intent the sweete smelling sacrifice may ascend vp to heauen, and that of his clemencie it would please him to re∣ceiue his prayers and oblations made vnto his diuine Maie∣stie. By such meanes did the people of Loraine obtaine by the mercie and fauour of God so much grace for their Duke <HI>Thierri,</HI> the sonne of <HI>William,</HI> the brother of <HI>Godfrey</HI> and <HI>Balawin</HI> Kings of Ierusalem, a most cruell and tyrannicall Prince, &amp; one that was a persecuter of the Church of God, and an oppresser of his subiects and vassals, in so much as he did not only come to himselfe and amended his wick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d life, (but also restoring that which he had wrong<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ully taken) he withdrew &amp; shut himselfe vp in a Monasterie, where by the space of foure yeares before his death, he led a perfect &amp; ho∣ly life. O that it would please God, that your great friend <HI>Philip</HI> the Catholike (in whom are wanting all the vertues which are fit and decent for a good and iust Prince) would doe the like, and would restore vnto others, the goods &amp; li∣uings taken from them, after the example of Duke <HI>Thierri,</HI> and not as did <HI>Charles</HI> the fift his father. And let this suffice for an aunswer to the first proposition alledged by you.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="100-118" TYPE="pages">
<PB N="100" REF="57"/>
<P>As touching the second: true it is, that <HI>Philip</HI> hath greatly aduaunced the Christian faith in the West Indies: in so much that this doeth serue him greatly as a cloake or mantle to couer, and to augment his vsurped power and tyrannie: but this good worke ought to bee impu∣ted to such deuout and religious persons, both of his subiects and others, as haue bene the instruments there∣of, rather then to him. See, I pray you, and consider well, how hee hath extended Religion in Affrique: hee hath euen of late, against the institutions of the order of the Knights of the Religion of <HI>Iesus Christ,</HI> and others, concluded and made peace in Barbarie with the Infidels, to the intent hee might with the more commoditie make warre in Europe against the Christians. And what doeth hee at this day against the Turke, but onely dallie and trifle with him?</P>
<P>Touching the third of your propositions: histories doe well recount, and all men may assure themselues, how much hee loueth the Ecclesiasticall persons, and what re∣uerence hee beareth to them that are religious. In times past, it was neuer seene, that any Ecclesiasticall or reli∣gious person hath beene put to death in Spaine, for any matters concerning the estate. The greatest crueltie, and most rigorous seuere iustice, that the Arrian Princes shewed vppon them for being contrarie to their opinions, was to imprison them, and to keepe them enclosed with∣in Monasteries. True it is, that of some of them they did put out the eyes, and afterwards, some Princes did cause them to be put to death secretly in prison: but as for the gallowes, and such like infamous deaths, they knew not what it meant, saue onely since the reigne of his Ma∣iestie, that will be held for so great and so good a Catholike. And I for my part do beleeue, that he is no lesse: and yet I know he is but a very bad Christian: for I make no doubt but he beleeueth all that which the holy Catholike, Aposto∣like Romane Church our mother teacheth, and instructeth
<PB N="101" REF="57"/> vs: howbeit I know full well, that he doth not obserue any of the precepts commanded in the Decalogue.</P>
<P>And as concerning the rest of your allegations made in his excuse; although that <HI>Philip</HI> hath builded vp a great number of Monasteries, and many Churches, endowing them with rich reuenues, yet all this will not make me, but that I must needes take him and acknowledge him for a no∣table tyrant, and a most cruell Prince. Historiographers haue written largely of the cruelty of <HI>Brunhault,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Brunhault caused ten kings of France to be put to death.</NOTE> (how∣beit, that some would excuse her, and doe attribute this fault vnto the first Writers) and they doe affirme, that shee caused to be put to death ten seuerall Kings in France, and many other persons of great quality. Also they write of her, that shee caused a great number of Churches to be buil∣ded, and did prouide them of so great goods and riches, that it is a very strange thing to be reported. See what <HI>Gaguin</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gaguin.</NOTE> writeth thereof: in so much, that if a man would compare the charge and expences of <HI>Brunhault,</HI> with the meanes shee had, he would greatly maruell, how this woman was able in one age to build so many Temples, and assigne vnto them also so good and large reuenues. Now <HI>Brunhault</HI> hath deserued another manner of praise and commendation, for vsing so great liberality towards the Church, then doth <HI>Philip,</HI> because shee gaue of her owne, and <HI>Philip</HI> giueth of other mens. In Spaine they finde great fault with those that will steale a sheepe, and will giue the feete for Gods sake: and so doth his Catholike Maiesty; hee draweth from the Clergy <HI>Tercias, Subsidio, Pila, Escusado:</HI> in so much,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See the mea∣ning of these words a little after.</NOTE> that of ten he taketh at the least fiue: and one Prelate payeth more vnto him then 2000 labourers, or 4000 Gentlemen. See then how liberall he is to the Clergy: and by the meanes of these feete of his sheepe, hee buildeth vp Monasteries and other Churches, and endoweth them with great reuenues.

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obiection."/> I know well, you will reply vnto me, and alledge, that the rents of the Churches of Spaine are so great and exces∣siue, that although the Prelates doe pay vnto their King the one halfe of them, yet they doe all of them still continue and remaine rich; because there be some Prelates in Spaine, which haue greater reuenues yeerely then 50 or 60 Pre∣lats in France. <MILESTONE UNIT="Answer."/> Hereunto I answer: that although it be so, yet his Catholike Maiesty may not spoile the Church of her goods, which Princes, and others Catholike and deuout persons haue giuen vnto her. And if the dowry of any Da∣mosell or maiden be priuiledged, how much more ought that so to be, which is giuen to God, and to our Lady, and to the Saints: who (as Histories doe specifie) haue foughten visibly and really, and haue beene seene in sundry battels personally, doing of great miracles? And therefore seeing that his Catholike Maiesty doth take away from the Chur∣ches
<PB N="103" REF="58"/> that which is giuen them, for the causes and reasons by vs alledged, he committeth fraud and sacriledge, which may be an occasion, that hee himselfe may happen ere he die, or his successors for him to repay the same againe. For this cause did <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> wander vp and downe for ma∣ny yeeres in the fields in the shape of a brute beast:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Daniel 4.</NOTE> and <HI>Bal∣thazar</HI> his sonne saw that horrible vision of a hand writing vpon a wall his future death and destruction.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Daniel 5. Acts 5.</NOTE> <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Saphira</HI> his wife fell downe dead at the feete of Saint <HI>Peter.</HI> We haue many examples touching this matter in the holy Scriptures, and many more in p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ophane Writers: and there is a great number of them euen in Spaine, especially in Ca∣stile. The Queene <HI>Dame Viraca,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Alphon∣sus</HI> the sixt Emperour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The common Histories of Spaine.</NOTE> going out of the Church of S. <HI>Isidore</HI> with the riches which shee had taken thence, fell downe dead at the Church doore. <HI>Don Alphonsus</HI> the warriour her Husband, for the like matter was vanquished by the Moores in the battell of Fraga, and was neuer more seene nor heard of after that time, neither aliue nor dead. The King <HI>Don Henry</HI> brother germane to the mother of Saint <HI>Lewes,</HI> being but a ladde, was slaine by the hazard of a brick or tile falling vpon him within Placentia. Some doe attri∣bute this his death to the carelesnesse of the said <HI>Henry,</HI> for not prouiding a remedy (albeit hee were in his tender and younger yeeres,) against the extortions done vpon the Churches, by the children of the Count <HI>Don Nugno de La∣ra,</HI> who were Tutors to the said <HI>Henry,</HI> and Gouernours of his Realme: and they doe affirme, that all those disasters and mishaps which Histories doe write of, did happen by the occasion of those his Tutors. These examples may suf∣fice to proue vnto you the abuse and inualidity of your re∣ply, and to shew that your <HI>Philip</HI> by laying of his hands vpon the Ecclesiasticall liuings, (as he hath done) cannot excuse himselfe of fraud, sacriledge, and tyranny; and so by this meanes (with an ill conscience) hee stealeth
<PB N="104" REF="59"/> the sheepe of another man, notwithstanding that hee giue againe the feete for God sake. And yet ouer and aboue all this, I doe assure you euen in the faith of an honest man, that if there were no other vices the person of King <HI>Philip</HI> saue onely these two, to wit, tyranny and cruelty, and if hee were a true obseruer of the rest of the Law and faith Catho∣like, I would excuse you of your blindnesse and inueigle∣ment: but you may hold this for a certainty, that his abho∣minable workes will proue any man whomsoeuer to be an egregious lyer, that shall be so hardy as to defend that hee is no such manner of man. For this enemy and generall per∣secuter, vnder the cloake and shadow of a Catholike, hath done more mischiefe, and committed more insolencies a∣gainst the Church of Rome, then all the other persecuters that euer went before him. Will you see the proofe how you are abused, and how bad and vile a Christian hee is? Open your eye liddes, and you shall see how he bewrayeth it, euen as if a man should with his finger point at it. In the yeere 1575, this King Catholike being aduertised that the late <HI>Monsieur</HI> did make great preparation to enter with a mighty Army into Flaunders, hee beganne very secretly to sound certaine of the principall Lords and chiefe heads of the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etended reformed Religion, within the Prouinces of Languedoc, Foix, Bearne, Bigorre, and of the Countrey <HI>de la Bort,</HI> neere to Guipuscua, ouer against Fontaraby, to know if they would vnder his protection defend their li∣berty, promising them, that he would cause an Army of Al∣maines to descend against the most Christian King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Offers made for King Phi∣lip to those of the reformed Religion, to make warre against the late French King.</NOTE> and that hee would giue them fiue hundred thousand crownes yeerely to that effect, and for the entertainement of the Mi∣nisters of their Churches: beating into their eares, and ma∣king them beleeue, that the enterprise of Flaunders, which the Duke of Alanson had vndertaken, did not tend to any other end, but onely to entrap, and to make another mas∣sacre of them, as had lately beene done vnder the King <HI>Charles</HI> the ninth his brother, when the Lord <HI>de la Noue</HI> was
<PB N="105" REF="59"/> taken, and the Lord <HI>de Iuoy</HI> was put to death betweene two Tables, with many other Lords and Gentlemen. He had the better meanes and opportunity to treat with the said Churches, by reason there were many Catholikes mingled amongst the Huguenots: all of which did gouerne, and de∣meane themselues according to the conuentions and agree∣ments made betweene them: and a great Lord of France, and the Lord <HI>Mounsieur de Chastillion,</HI> howbeit that af∣terwards this vnion was broken. Some of their chiefe heads did giue eare vnto those perswasiōs of <HI>Philip,</HI> insomuch that there were great preparations made for a strong &amp; mighty warre against them, which succeeded not long after, when Brouage was taken. Besides, the said Lords and heads of the reformed Religion, with some of their Ministers, being en∣tred into a great iealousie of the most Christian King now raigning, (who was then King of Nauarre) and of the late <HI>Monsieur</HI> the Prince of Condy, they resolued secretly with∣in the Towne of Montauban, to call in strangers of their Re∣ligion to be their Protectours and defenders. And to that effect, they sent one of their Ministers into Almaine, feining that they sent him vnto the pretended reformed Church of Metz. Notwithstanding the matter was discouered by one of the principall Lords, newly drawne to be of their Reli∣gion, who had taken great indignation against a Minister of his owne, and because hee had been an assistant at the same Councell, he thought he had beene of the same minde also: and did therefore reproue him, saying: that he greatly mar∣uelled how he could suffer such a quill to be thrust through his nose, without laughing at it. But the Minister excused himselfe, assuring him that he knew nothing of that matter. But that was an occasion, that the practise brake off: be∣sides, that they were not well agreed amongst themselues, whom they should choose to bee their chiefe and prote∣ctour: some of them desired the Duke <HI>Casimier:</HI> others would haue England: and some others the Duke of Sauoy: who all that time did not know any thing at all of that
<PB N="106" REF="60"/> which passed betweene him and the Ministers. But after that, at such time as the young Duke (now presently ru∣ling) came to succeed his Father, he being aduertised there∣of, sent vnto the King of Nauarre, to demaund the Lady his sister for his wife: one named <HI>Seruin</HI> was dispatched as the messenger to that effect, and after him a Viscount; who seeing great difficulty in the demaund, went by Bearne into Spaine, where he treated the mariage of the Infant <HI>D. Ka∣therine,</HI> at this day Dutchesse of Sauoy: which mariage <HI>Don Amadis</HI> the bastard brother of the said Duke after∣wards effected. This mariage came well to purpose for <HI>Philip,</HI> because by this meanes hee assured himselfe of the Duke, that he should attempt nothing in Portugall: where he knew full well, that after the death of King <HI>Henry,</HI> there was great diuision amongst the Portugals, for that some would haue had the Lady <HI>Katherine</HI> Dutchesse of Bragan∣cia: others the Lord <HI>Don Anthonio:</HI> and in a manner all well neere not liking to haue any of those which were na∣med, would haue had the said Duke of Sauoy, being the Graund-childe of a Daughter of Portugall, who (as the re∣port is) if hee had gone thither during the inter-raigne in Portugall, at the time of that dissention, and by reason of their vnwillingnesse to admit the one or the other of those aboue named, he had without doubt beene receiued of all the Portugals.</P>
<P>To proceede, and to shew you yet more plainely what manner of man this is, for whose loue you doe euen seeke your owne destruction, and in whose seruice you are so for∣ward and so diligent: I will adde here somewhat more tou∣ching this matter, for it is not possible to vtter all that may be spoken to that effect. It is not long since, that for to fol∣low the steppes of some other good and godly Catholikes as himselfe is, he rendered the City of Arzile to <HI>Muley Hamet</HI> King of Marocco, against the will and liking of the Portugals which did inhabit it, who had bound them∣selues without his aide to defend it. It was supposed by
<PB N="107" REF="60"/> all the Christians, that <HI>Philip</HI> surrendered the City, because hee was assured that hee should not be able to defend it a∣gainst the puissance of Infidels, for so did he himselfe cause it to be giuen out, saying:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The reason why Philip rendred that City of Arzil to Muley Ha∣met.</NOTE> That it was a lesse mischiefe to render it without hazarding the liues and goods of the In∣habitants, then by keeping it, to put them all in daunger. But therein hee abused them most maliciously, for the true cause why this good Catholike rendered this City of Chri∣stians vnto the Moores, was because he had promised it vn∣to their King, vpon condition he should not lend two hun∣dred thousand Crownes to <HI>Don Anthonio</HI> his cousin ger∣man, King of Portugall. The which summe the Moore had before promised to lend him at the intercession of England: and for this reason had the said <HI>Don Anthonio</HI> sent his sonne <HI>Don Christopher</HI> to Marocco to be there in hostage for the said summe of money, who remained there by the space of foure yeeres. You see now what a good and Catholike Christian deede this man did, whom you doe so defend for a most singular Christian and Catholike, who to hinder a King, a farre better Catholike then himselfe, from recoue∣ring of his owne, doth not onely tyrannically detaine ano∣thers right, but doth make it away from Christians, to giue it vnto Infidels. What answer doe you make hereunto? I make your selues the Iudges: wherefore then will you not acknowledge the irreligion of this man, to whom you are so affectionate, and the great malice and peruersenesse of him, whom you loue so well? Consider and know, that you are taken and bound with a grosse chaine:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalme 41.</NOTE> and that <HI>abissus abissum inuocat:</HI> One depth calleth another. And I say to you, one fault draweth on an hundred thousand after it. Of the maintaining and defending of an euill and wic∣ked man, ensueth commonly a sinister and peruerse iudgement of them which are good. This was well seene to be true and verified in the life time of <HI>Don Antho∣nio,</HI> and is yet still euen at this day. It is a shame to heare the abhominations which the fauourers of this
<PB N="108" REF="61"/> pretended King Catholike haue heretofore spoken and gi∣uen out, and doe not yet cease to speake of this poore Prince deceased. Some call him rebell, others terme him a runni-gate, and a fugitiue from place to place, and from Countrey to Countrey: and some others call him a seditious person, an enemy to Christendome, an Infidell, and an hereticke. Can there be any thing more grieuous, more sensible, more vniust, and more vnworthy of a Christian? How dare you (against all Lawes both diuine and humane) handle and vse so ill, a Prince, the sonne of the greatest Prince of his age: the graund-child of that great <HI>Emanuel,</HI> from whom the Princes of Europe doe glory to draw their descent and originall: a Prince sore pressed and turmoyled with afflicti∣ons, trouble and perplexity. He hath well shewed euen in his exile and banishment, that he was a better Catholike then your <HI>Philip</HI> his cousin: lesse ambitious, without chol∣ler, without hatred, and full of charity. For if he would haue beene content to recouer his Realme of Portugall, with more honourable meanes then your tyrant hath tyrannized ouer it, and doth yet tyrannously detaine it, hee might well haue done it. If he would haue accorded, that the Eng∣lish should haue had exercise of their Religion in Portugall, onely within their owne Houses and lodgings, the Earle of Leicester (whom some call the Count of Lest) would haue vndertaken to set him againe in possession of his Realmes and Seigniories. In the yeere one thousand fiue hundred eighty nine, when hee passed into Portugall with the Eng∣lish, amongst other Articles of agreement made betweene them, there was no other thing granted nor yeelded vnto them, but onely a licence or liberty for them to liue in Por∣tugall, without being bound or compelled by the Eccle∣siasticall Prelates, to repaire to the Churches to the seruice and exercise of the Catholikes. And in the same man∣ner, as the Queene of England did then entertaine the straungers Catholickes, inhabiting within her Realme of England: euen so did hee accord and ordaine that the
<PB N="109" REF="61"/> English should finde the like vsage and entertainement in Portugall. And it may be, that if he would haue enlarged their libertie in this respect, the English would againe haue enforced their aboade in that Countrey. But he proceeded so like a Catholicke with them, that they had a kinde of di∣strust, and tooke occasion to suspect him. The king of Ma∣rocco at this day now raigning, (of whom wee haue lately spoken) sent an Embassadour into England, to intreat him, touching the deliuering of Portugall from her tyranny: of∣fering him to make present payment of 100 thousand Crownes at London, for the prouyding of 100 sayle of shipps to passe into Barbary, from whence he promised to embarke, and to passe with him in person, and also to set at liberty about seuen or eight thousand Portugalls, whom he held in captiuity, and which were good souldiers, and with them and the principall horse of Barbary, to take land and set foote in Spaine, and to put him in possession of his Realme. But <HI>Don Anthonio</HI> would not accept those his of∣fers, because hee would giue no occasion to the Moores, (namely those Moores that are baptized and liue as Chri∣stians in Arragon, Valentia, Murcia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cause why Don Antho∣nio refused the meanes to re∣couer his Realme.</NOTE> and other quarters of Spaine, where the Moore did assure himselfe to finde 60 thousand men at his deuotion) there to rebell, and to worke the misery and calamity of the Christians. This was a more daungerous matter, and would haue beene more burthen∣some and chargeable to King <HI>Pbilip,</HI> then to the King <HI>Don Anthonio,</HI> with whome <HI>Muley Hamet</HI> desired to haue made a peace very beneficiall and aduantageous to the Realmes of Portugall: but <HI>Don Anthonio</HI> refused all, onely mooued thereunto of a godly Catholicke zeale. Now shew me (my Masters) where or when your <HI>Don Philip</HI> euer did as much: He hath made great promises to <HI>Don Anthonio,</HI> to the in∣tent he might cause him to renounce his right, which he had in Portugall, by reason of his election. He offered to make him Viceroy of Naples,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Offers of king Philip to Don Anthonio.</NOTE> with 400 thousand Crownes of yearely rent, and the collation of the officers and benefices
<PB N="110" REF="62"/> of that kingdome. Moreruer he would haue giuen him 500 thousand Crownes to pay his debts, and to defray the charge of going to take that Gouernement vpon him: And that hee would bee bound to restore all those Portugals to their former estates, whose goods he had taken and con∣fiscated for following of his partie. And that hee would aduaunce and recompence such as did serue and attend him actually: and that he would pardon all in generall. Whereunto <HI>Don Anthonio</HI> made him this aunswer: God defend that he should commit so great a fault:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Don Antho∣nio full of conscience.</NOTE> and that he had rather die in an hospitall, then to doe a thing so hai∣nous, wicked, vniust, and against his conscience, for that the lawes had taught him thus much, that he might not contract for that which appertained to another. For, when he was chosen at Sautaren, he had then sworne, and after∣wards againe at Lisbon (when he was confirmed King by the deputies of the cities and townes of Portugall, which came thither to take their oath for their allegeance, and to doe him homage) that he should neuer accord nor fall to any agreement with the enemy, without leauing Portu∣gall in her full and perfect libertie. This may serue to shew how much better a Catholike, and how lesse ambitious the King <HI>Don Anthonio</HI> was then King <HI>Philip.</HI> And as tou∣ching his choller and his hatred or charitie, that may ap∣peare by this which followeth, in that there haue beene many men who haue oftentimes offered to <HI>Don Anthonio</HI> to kill <HI>Philip:</HI> neuerthelesse he would neuer giue them any entertainment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Most christian speaches of D. Anthonio.</NOTE> alledging that Kings are the annoynted of the Lord: and although (quoth he) my cousin King <HI>Philip</HI> blinded by ambition and tyrannie, do persecute me, and do seeke to take my life from me, yet will not I be content nor consent for all that, that any man for the loue of me, should attempt to take his life. And whosoeuer shall dare or ad∣uenture to do it, let him looke to himselfe that he come not into my hands. For though his sins do so blind and bewitch him, as that they make him shew himselfe a <HI>Saul</HI> against me
<PB N="111" REF="62"/> yet I for my part do protest before God, to shew my selfe a <HI>Dauid</HI> towards him. A certaine man on a day demaunding of him a fauour for the good newes which hee brought him (for he had assured him that King <HI>Philip</HI> was dead) he aun∣swered him halfe in choller; My good friend, doest thou not know who it is of whom thou speakest vnto me? hee is my cousin germane, bring me newes that I haue eight or ten thousand faithfull men, and well armed with good and sage Captaines, and all things necessary to restore Portugall to libertie, and I promise thee in the word of an honest man, to make thee so rich and so honourable in my Realme, as no Gentleman shall go beyond thee: go, go, learne to know the disposition of Princes Now my masters, what thinke you of these examples? do you now see what reason I haue to say, that the King <HI>Don Anthonio</HI> was more Catholike, and lesse ambitious then the king <HI>Philip,</HI> &amp; that he was a man with∣out choller &amp; hatred, but contrarywise full of charity? I pray you therefore for the loue of God, that from henceforth you would resolue your selues, with a sound and vncorrupted iudgement, &amp; a pure conscience, and without any inueigle∣ment or indiscreet zeale, to embrace the good, and to reiect the euill. If he be dishonest, luxurious &amp; licentious, I say no∣thing in that behalfe: for that is not the butt or ende of our treatise: and I beleeue, that the Prince of Orange in his A∣pologie, hath said something touching that matter: and the infamous rumour and detestable report which hath runne, and doth yet runne throughout the world, doeth say much to that effect. God giue him the grace to know himselfe, and to conuert, and to render to euery man his owne before his death, better then he hath restored that which (as is repor∣ted) his father at the hower of his death commaunded him to render and to restore againe.</P>
<P>Now, most humbly I beseech your Maiesties to hold me excused, for hauing beene so large in this matter: because I haue not done it without good cause, knowing that to come to the butte and end of my purpose, it was very needfull,

<HEAD>The Translators encouragement to these most worthie Princes.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The inward affection which I haue vnto your Maiesties the loyalty which J owe vnto your seruices, and the desire which J haue to see the augmentation of the good and prosperity of Fraunce: besides my age, and long experience in matters of estate, do giue me the assurance and hardinesse to aduertise, you by the way of something concerning the matter here spoken of by the Author. I had of late certaine intelligence by letters from some of my friends, that the King of Tartaria now raigning (whome the auncient Historiographers and Cosmographers do call,</HI> Magnum Can, Regem regum, &amp; Dominum dominan∣tium, <HI>that is, The great Cham, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords) who is said to be a most prudent, braue, ard warlike Prince, hath determined for the great deuotion which he bea∣reth to his great Prophet</HI> Mahomet <HI>(whose sect he professeth) to passe with great forces to Mecha in Arabia, and there to seaze vpon the bodie of his said Prophet. This Sophie of Per∣sia being ascertained of this enterprise (whom the Authour in this his treatise nameth</HI> Xatama) <HI>presently dispatched away certaine Embassadours to Constantinople, to the great Seignior of the Turkes, with whom for these manie yeares of late he hath had great warres, and continuall enmitie, to pray him that hee would ioyne his forces with his, to the end they might both of them ioyntly resist and withstand the puissance of the Tarta∣rian, shewing him also the danger which both the one and the o∣ther of them might incurre to the losse of their estates, by hauing to their neighbour an enemy so sage and puissant. I would to God your Maiesties would now consider, that if these considerations do fall into the vnderstanding of a Barbarian, how much more ought they not to bee wanting in men of iudgemeot and vnder∣standing: and I would your Maiesties would ponder aduisedly, how much it importeth you not to suffer the greatnesse of the Castillian your next and nearest neighbour. Ioyne your forces with your Confederates, and take in hand this enterprise, in such
<PB N="114" REF="64"/> sort as you may deuide the power and monarchie of the enemie, I doe not say that you should send to pill &amp; ransacke them which are vnder the yoke and commaund of the enemie, God forbid: for this would turne as much to his good and profit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as to our hurt and domage, because by our pilling and sacking of them, wee shall giue them cause (who now hate him deadlie, and can not abide not onely him, nor so much as to heare him named) for the defence of themselues, and to bee reuenged of their doma∣ges, and our extorsions done vpon them, to ioyne themselues with our enemie, and to serue him with loue and fidelitie: and contrarywise, to prosecute and pursue vs with extreame hatred, doing their worst that they may against vs: in such sort, that wee losing our friends, who now desire to assist vs, shall purchase them for our enemies; and they will aspire nor seeke nothing more then our ruine and destruction. On the contrarie, in steed of mortall enemies which he hath now of them, shall finde them to be his friends to ayde and assist him, to the maintainance of his ambition and tyrannie. And this is that which hee doth seeke and desire (shewing himselfe in the meane while like a most wylie Foxe) and to this effect he will not spare to giue money liberally, because of the good that may redound thereof vnto him. This is a thing most certaine, that hee desireth extreamly to see them made poore and ruinated whom he feareth, &amp;c. I am fully perswaded that fewer words then these will suffice, to giue your Maiesties to vnder∣stand, how much it importeth you to preserue and desend peo∣ple that are malcontent and afflicted in miserie, and how much mischiefe may ensue by giuing them cause of scandall and of∣fence. That which we ought to doe in this case, is to trauell by all meanes possible to set foot in Spaine, and to fortifie our selues within it, gathering and drawing vnto vs such as are scanda∣lized and ill handled by the enemie, and to receiue them with humanitie and curtesie: so did</HI> William <HI>the Conquerour gaine the Realme of England; the which also in the same manner</HI> Henrie <HI>the seuenth did afterwards get likewise. Many others haue done the like: yea, and your Maiesties also, who if you shall
<PB N="115" REF="64"/> seize vpon some places in Spaine, you shall make your owne peace with honour, profite and aduantage. This which I say, is not to contradict that which many desire, without considering what is expedient and necessarie to a matter of so great importance? but rather to shew, how your Maiesties may doe without any losse and detriment, and to the best profit and aduantage of your Realmes, yea and of all the common weale of Christendome. The holy King and Prophet</HI> Dauid, <HI>as a most politike and wise man, counselleth vs to pray to God for those things which are needfull to the peace of Jerusalem, that is, the Church militant, &amp; conse∣quently, wee are commaunded to do it.</HI> Primo, rogate quae ad pacem sunt Ierusalem: <HI>Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.</HI> Se∣cundo, Fiat pax. <HI>Secondly, Let peace be (but the world shall ne∣uer haue peace till Spaine be deuided)</HI> in virtute tua. <HI>That is to say, in such sort, as we may not loose one iote of our estate, honour, reputation and integritie, and other things of like nature and qualitie, whereof I will surcease to speake any further, because I will not trouble the discourse of the Authour.</HI></P>

And if it bee well considered, that this laughter proceedeth not but of the great griefe and sorrow which I haue at my heart, I be∣leeue assuredly that it would bee to more purpose then all your teares, cries, and lamentations: and I will then say of you as <HI>Hanniball</HI> said of the Carthagenians: You weepe, you sigh, and you lament to see your townes taken, your countrey ransacked &amp; spoyled, your children, brethren, kins∣folkes, countrimen and friends, slaine and killed, and your goods wasted and lost: you know all of you how to remedy it, and confesse that you know it: and yet there is none of you that will resolue, nor shew himselfe forward, for the publike &amp; common good, as well as for the particular good of euerie one: and there is none that either speaketh or tal∣keth of it, saying, let vs free our countrey, let vs succour our
<PB N="116" REF="65"/> friends, let vs cast out and driue away our enemies: I will doe this or that, I will giue thus much for the publike and common good of my countrie. Are you so straight laced for so small a matter, which should redeeme you, and set you altogether in peace, rest, and quietnesse? and which should deliuer your friends, who will serue you as a ram∣pier or bulwarke, and will cast your enemies out of your prouinces, and will driue them into a corner, where they shall feare you more then they doe now scorne and con∣temne you? I am sore afraide, that before many daies be past, you will confesse you wept hitherto but for trifles, in comparison of that which is to come. I pray God you doe not follow the steps of <HI>Antiochus,</HI> who seeing himselfe van∣quished by the Romanes for want of following the counsell of <HI>Hanniball,</HI> was greatlie astonished, but all too late. And hee then esteemed <HI>Hanniball</HI> not onely sage and prudent, but also, euen as a Prophet; for that he had foretold him all that which afterwards happened vnto him. Awake ther∣fore I pray you, and consider well vppon that which I counsell you for your good: and that he which doth aduise you to it, doeth desire it as your poore seruitour and friend, who hath as great a care of your safeties &amp; preseruation, as of his owne: and who hath often foretold, and (as it were) prophecied (as the prin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ipall counsellers of estate, both in Fraunce &amp; in England can well testifie) both all this which is come to passe in this behalfe, and hath also foreshewed all that which hath beene lost in Fraunce, and to what end and issue things will grow at the last, if there be not some better order taken in these affaires. And I beleeue, that if they were demanded the question, they will tell you, how I haue passed away my time with as great griefe and discon∣tentment, as a man possibly might do, to see the enemy dai∣ly to prosper, and to waxe more proud and arrogant by your owne proper sufferance, consent, and wilfulnesse: &amp; for this cause, I am in a manner wholly resolued, to leaue and abandon the conuersation of men, &amp; to retire &amp; withdraw
<PB N="117" REF="65"/> my selfe into some solitary mountaine. Notwithstanding, because I know and am acquainted with all that hath be∣falne for these 50 yeeres last past in the greatest part of Europe; I doe therefore tell you, as one that hath had expe∣rience of these matters, that as yet you may recouer (if you will) all that which hitherto you haue lost, and both deliuer your friends and bridle your enemies. And you may take such order, that the time to come shall be more happy and fortunate vnto you, then the time already past hath beene. And moreouer, I doe assure you, that sithens the losse of great part of Christendome wonne by the Turke, the late losse of the most part of Germany, the hereditary possession of the King of Bohemia, all Switzerland, with the great hazard of losing all the Netherlands, who are now striuing for breath against the King of Spaines mighty powers now in the field, (which I for my part doe thinke to haue procee∣ded from the very hand of God, as of your louing Father, who by a fatherly loue doth chastise you, to the end you should awaken you out of your security and negligence) I haue beene euer since resolued to set downe in writing, that which I haue so often pronounced by word of mouth, to so many persons of speciall marke and quality, before that euer they did entreat me thereunto. And this is the cause, that if this my writing doe not produce that publike good, and that effect which I desire, I protest that from henceforth I will for euer hold my peace and be silent. Ne∣uerthelesse, I most humbly beseech your Christian Maiesties and all the Princes and Potentates of Europe, and all the great Lords and Officers of the Crownes of England and of Fraunce, that it would please you to descend into your selues, and at your leisure according to your accustomed prudence and wisdome, to consider that good fortune and felicity doth not consist so much in the conquest and subdu∣ing of great Seigniories and large dominions, for the time present, with an intent to leaue the same to your successors: but rather to assure, confirme, and preserue them for the time
<PB N="118" REF="66"/> to come to your children and posterity: to the intent that when it shall please God to call you hence, they may quiet∣ly and peaceably enioy them in peace and tranquility, with∣out any trouble, disquiet, or hinderance. For it is a farre greater vertue, to preserue and keepe that which is gotten, then to get and purchase new things daily.</P>

By reason of this mariage, in the yeere 1475, <HI>Don Alphonso</HI> went into the Lands and Countrey of his said wife, where he had many encounters and combats with <HI>Fernand</HI> King of Arragon, the Husband of <HI>Jsabel</HI> the pretended Queene of Castile, and with his people, till such time as they en∣countered in the battell which was foughten neere the Ci∣ty of Toro,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The battell of Toro.</NOTE> in March 1476, which was ordered in this manner: the King <HI>Alphonso</HI> had made one Campe of the Lords and Nobles of the Realmes of Castile and Leon, with some Portugals: the Prince <HI>Don Juan</HI> his sonne, (who was come to the succours of his Father) had made another Campe of his Portugals, without any Castillians mingled amongst them: The King <HI>Fernand</HI> made also two campes, the one of the Castillians, which tooke his part and his wiues: and the other of Arragonois, the Catalans, the Va∣lencians, and such other peoples and Nations, as were the subiects of his owne Realmes and Seigniories, whereof himselfe was Lord and commaunder. <HI>Fernand</HI> encountring with <HI>Alphonso,</HI> defeated and ouercame him: and hauing ta∣ken his Guidon royall, made him forsake the field, and to betake himselfe to flight.

And he said vnto him: Sir, your Highnesse hath kept the Field long enough, these three houres you haue staied here, are as good as three dayes, and one houre is as much as three. Some write, that in memory of this victory, King <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth of England, sent vnto this Prince the or∣der of the Garter.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Simancas.</NOTE>Touching <HI>Simancas,</HI> you are to vnderstand, that in the yeere 1463, <HI>Henry</HI> the 4 raigning in Castile, at the perswa∣sion of some of the Princes, many other Cities and Townes did reuolt from him, and grew into a rebellion, which they called, <HI>The league of the Princes:</HI> and they entituled them∣selues, Princes of the League. And in imitation hereof did <HI>Philip</HI> King of Castile, in the yeere 1582, baptize the League, which hath beene the occasion of so many mis∣chiefes and afflictions, of which Fraunce hath especially ta∣sted, and had experience for these nine yeeres last past. This is that League which hath wrought so great damage to the Church of Rome, and hath so ruinated and pulled it downe, as it shall neede many hundreds of yeeres to restore it a∣gaine. But to our matter: in processe of time, the Souldiers of the Kings Army, being greatly augmented, and their pu∣issance much increased, they came to the City of Toro: and the King hauing aduertisement, that they of the League were issued out of Valladolid, and that hauing broken downe and razed the walles of Begnafleur, they were gone to Simancas, he sent presently <HI>Iohn Hernandes Galiude</HI> his Captaine Generall, with 3000 Horses, for the succours of the Towne: which being entred into Simancas, were besie∣ged by them of the League, who notwithstanding, were more afraid then those whom they had besieged. The Lac∣kies within the Towne (who shewed themselues to be of a wonderfull good courage) hauing assembled themselues one day in a great number, and mocking those that had be∣sieged them, did make a picture, which represented the
<PB N="123" REF="68"/> Archbishop of Toledo; whom (because he was a Rebell a∣gainst his King and Lord) they called <HI>Don Opas,</HI> the bro∣ther of the Count <HI>Iulian,</HI> who caused the Moores to enter into Spaine against the King <HI>Rodericke.</HI> After which, one of the Lackies being appointed for a Iudge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iudgement giuen by the Lackies a∣gainst the Archbishop of Toledo.</NOTE> sate himselfe downe on the iudgement seat, commanding the prisoner to be brought before him, (which was the picture of the Archbishop) and he gaue iudgement vpon him in this man∣ner: For as much as <HI>Don Alphonso Carillo</HI> Archbishop of Toledo,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guar. lib. 17. cap. 14.</NOTE> following the steppes of the Bishop <HI>Don Opas</HI> the destroyer of Spaine, hath beene a Traytor to his King and naturall Lord, rebelling against him with his places and Fortresses, and with the money which he put into his hands to doe him seruice. For these causes, hauing seene and con∣sidered of his deserts by his triall, wherein hath appeared his wicked practises, and felonious offences, we doe there∣fore condemne him to be burned; and that he be first trayled and drawne through the streetes and publike places of Si∣mancas: and that in the execution thereof, the common cryer shall cry and proclaime with a loud voice: This is the iustice commanded to be done, namely, that this cruell <HI>Don Opas</HI> shall be burnt for his offence and trespasse; because hauing receiued diuers places, fortresses, and monies of his King, hee hath notwithstanding reuolted and rebelled a∣gainst him.</P>
<Q><L>Quien tal haze, que tal pague.</L>
<L><HI>That is to say,</HI></L>
<L>So doe, so haue.</L></Q>
<P>The iudgement being pronounced: another Lackey ta∣king the picture between his armes with an open cry, threw it forth of the Towne, hauing in his company more then three hundred Lackies, and immediately two of their com∣pany made a great fire to burne it, not farre from the campe of the enemy, who looked on whilest they were doing of it; and whilest the picture was in burning, all the Lackies to∣gether with open throat cryed and sang:
<Q><PB N="124" REF="69"/>
<L>Esta es Simancas,</L>
<L>Don Opas Trahidor,</L>
<L>Y no Penaflor.</L></Q></P>
<P>Which is to say:
<Q><L>This is Simancas,</L>
<L>(Don Opas, O thou Traitour)</L>
<L>And not Pegnastor.</L></Q> With many other speeches to that purpose. Which song of theirs was for a long time after vsed in Castile, and was commonly sung both in the Court, and throughout all that Realme.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Celorico.</NOTE>After that the Portugals had deposed <HI>Don Sancho,</HI> surna∣med <HI>Capelo,</HI> from his Realme and Kingdome, <HI>Don Alphonso</HI> his brother (who was then County of Bologne vpon the Sea) was chosen Gouernour of Portugall by the same Por∣tugals. This election (which they made, together with the deposition of the said <HI>Sancho,</HI> was approued and confirmed by Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> the 4, in a Councell held at Lyons: which was the cause that the said <HI>Alphonso</HI> went from thence into Portugall with Letters of fauour from the said <HI>Innocent</HI> the fourth, to the peoples of Portugall, praying and requiring them, that they would obey and submit themselues vnto him, and deliuer vnto him all the Cities, Townes, and Ca∣stles of the Realme in generall. Neuerthelesse some speciall persons there were, who (notwithstanding the comman∣dement of the Pope, or the force of <HI>Alphonso</HI>) because they supposed that this did derogate from the loyalty which they ought vnto their King, would not yeeld thereunto, but op∣posed themselues against the said <HI>Alphonso,</HI> and would not render vnto him the Townes and Castles which had beene committed to their custody by their King <HI>Sancho, Fernand Ruis Pach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>co</HI> Lord of Ferreyra was one of those, who be∣ing besieged by <HI>Don Alphonso</HI> within the Towne of <HI>Celo∣rico,</HI> and seeing himselfe in extreame necessity of victuals, there happened by great chance a Trowt to fall within the Castle from the talents of an Eagle, flying ouer the place: of
<PB N="125" REF="69"/> the which he made a present to <HI>Don Alphonso</HI> with two fine white manchets, to the intent he might make him be∣leeue that hee was very well prouided of victuals, seeing he was not as yet without such delicates and dainties. In so much that the Gouernour <HI>Alphonso</HI> beleeuing that he had victuals secretly conueyed vnto him, raised his siege and de∣parted. This deuise was imputed to <HI>Fernand Ruis,</HI> as a no∣table point of fidelitie in the seruice of his Lord and mai∣ster: after whose death he did immediatly yeeld vp the said towne to the said <HI>Alphonso,</HI> then elected and cho∣sen King of Portugall (for that <HI>Sancho</HI> his brother had left no issue behinde him) without any other accord or con∣dition.</P>
<P>The said <HI>Alphonsus</HI> for the same reason besieged the Ca∣stle of the citie of Coimbre,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Castle o Coimbre.</NOTE> the Captaine whereof was cal∣led <HI>Martin de Freytas;</HI> who was brought to that necessi∣tie, that both bread and water failed him, notwithstanding neither his owne wants, nor the great promises which <HI>Al∣phonsus</HI> made vnto his Captaine could draw him to render the Castle vnto him. <HI>Don Alphonso</HI> considering the loyalty and constancie of his Captaine, and being desirous to saue his life, assoone as tydings were brought him that the King <HI>Sancho</HI> his brother was dead (who died during the siege) he sent from his armie to the besieged, both bread, flesh, and o∣ther victuals necessarie for their sustenance; and hee wrote vnto the Captaine that the King <HI>Sancho</HI> was dead and bu∣ried in the towne of Toledo; and he promised to giue him great honour and preferment, praying him that he would not any longer trouble himselfe, but render vp the castle vn∣to him, seeing now his King was deceased, and that he was chosen King by the Portugals, and had beene receiued and confirmed in the kingdome by the oth of fidelitie and alle∣geance throughout the realme. The Captaine seeing the letter, demanded of the King onely so long time of truce, as was needfull for him to go into Castile, and to see with his owne eyes, if that report were true or not: which the
<PB N="118" REF="70"/> King hauing graunted him, he tooke his iourney, and comming to Toledo, caused the sepulchre of King <HI>San∣cho</HI> to bee opened, and hauing taken good notice and knowledge of him, hee bound the keyes of the Castle to his right arme, of the which hee caused an act and re∣cord to be made by a publike Notarie, whom he had there of purpose to that effect: And so returning from thence into Portugall, he rendred the castle to the King <HI>Alphon∣sus.</HI> The King in token of so rare a constancie and fideli∣tie, restored to him againe the keeping of the said castle, and gaue him the place freely to him and to the heires of his bodie for euer, with this prerogatiue, that neither he, nor any of his posteritie, should bee bounden to doe homage for the same, either to himselfe or to the Kings his successors. <HI>Freytas</HI> hauing kissed the Kings hand, and yeelded most humble thanks to his Maiestie for so great a fauour, did not onely refuse to accept of the Kings gift, but forbad his sonnes, and all the issue that should descend of him, vpon paine of his curse, neuer to take charge, nor to vndertake the custodie and guard of any towne or ca∣stle, for which they should bee bounden to doe fealtie and homage vnto any Prince whatsoeuer. Thus you see, what is meant by <HI>Auila, Simancas, Celorico,</HI> &amp; the castle of <HI>Coim∣bre,</HI> all which are notable examples most worthy to be con∣sidered, and may bee a shame to many men in this our age, wherein they make so small account &amp; reckening of a ver∣tue so rare and commendable. My maisters, put your hands, I pray you, into your bosoms, and see how they are full of leprosie: returne and consider well with your selues, and ac∣knowledge your faults, for God hath alwaies his eares open to heare them that seeke vnto him for mercie.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The title of the King of Castile, and of Spaine.</NOTE>Now as concerning the king of Castile, I would be very glad, that you would well vnderstand &amp; conceiue what the meaning of this is, &amp; wherof we haue already spoken some∣what; &amp; is at large handled in that booke which Frier <HI>Ioseph Texere</HI> (a religious person of the order of S. <HI>Dominicke</HI> hath<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the yeare 1594 at Paris.</NOTE>
<PB N="119" REF="70"/> made concerning the Genealogie of the most christian king: who is the very same person, that did preach, how we are bound to loue all men of whatsoeuer religion, sect or nation that they be, euen the Castilians themselues: which Monke beeing a Portugall (it may bee) doth not fully know how much the Spanish nation is agreeued to see and heare, that kin <HI>Philip</HI> should entitle himself king of Spaine (we speake nor meane not in this number the vulgar and rascall sort of Castilians, because they are perswaded that their king be∣ing so, they alone shall haue all the rule &amp; gouernment of the world.) For there bee diuers other reasons besides those which he alledgeth, which are of no small importance to let you know: that as they of Arragon &amp; Nauarre are not alto∣gether out of hope to see themselues yet one day deliuered from the tyrant (which may be also said of Portugall,) so they haue a desire likewise to preserue their monarchies en∣tire, that is to say, the priuiledges, preheminences, preroga∣tiues, dignities, offices, customes, &amp; lāguage of their realmes: &amp; it may be, that God of his diuine goodnes &amp; mercy will permit one day, that there shalbe raised vp some <HI>Moses</HI> for the restoring of them to their liberty, for so also some haue written touching the children of Israell; that after their en∣try into Egipt, they did continually keep 3 things especially vncorrupted &amp; in their first integrity: to wit, their language, which was the Hebrew tongue, one selfe same fashion of ap∣parelling themselues, and the proprietie of the surnames of their Families. And in case his Christian Maiesty would re∣solue to draw &amp; deliuer that realme of Nauarre from the ty∣ranny of the Castilian, hee should finde a Constable &amp; all o∣ther officers of the said realme, who would assist him, &amp; doe their vttermost endeauors to serue him faithfully: to the in∣tent they might remaine in their countrey with their char∣ges &amp; offices, vnder the obeissance of a naturall king, &amp; not of a Castilian. And if the most excellent Duke of Lorraine, were disposed to restore, Arragon, Valentia, Catalonia, &amp;c. he should haue an Admirall, &amp; many officers of those realms
<PB N="128" REF="71"/> to accompany him: &amp; they would hold &amp; esteeme thēselues for most happy &amp; fortunate, to deliuer their cuntry frō the tyranny &amp; yoak of a stranger, &amp; to redeliuer it to a naturall &amp; lawfull Prince. If the Portugals likewise would determine and resolue themselues to choose by election (as they haue right so to doe) some Prince or some other of the people ei∣ther white, or negro (for it is most certaine, that to deliuer themselues of the tyranny of <HI>Philip,</HI> they would be content to receiue to their King the meanest negro of Guinee, if he be a Christian, and will liue in the Realme with them) they are fully perswaded, and they haue reason, that this would be a great help and furtherance to the accomplishment of their desires, to finde for their defence and preseruation, a Constable of Portugall, a Marshall, and Admirall, and all o∣ther such like officers of the Realme: and their records and writings done in their owne tongue, the fashions of their garments, and the surnames of their families. Contrary∣wise, if it be graunted and yeelded vnto <HI>Philip,</HI> that he may once take vpon him this title of King of Spaine, it is most certaine and sure, that he will make onely one house royall of all Spaine, with a Constable, Marshall, or Marshals, and Admirall, graund Maister, great Chamberlaine, maister of the Horse, and all other such like officers of the Realme, all which shall be called of Spaine generally, and they will call themselues also by the name onely of Spaniards, and so will vnite all of them into one onely bodie, which will turne to the great dammage and preiudice of the particular states and kingdomes of Spaine, and to the great profit and surety of <HI>Philip</HI> and his posteritie. Full little do strangers know of what importance this matter is: and thereof it commeth that they speake so fondly and foolishly when they talke thereof, which is a thing greatly to be blamed and repre∣hended in them: considering that it is against the law, which sayth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inciuile est de re incognita iudicare.</NOTE> that it is a great inciuility for any man to iudge of that which hee doth not vnderstand. The nations of Spaine doe see very well what mischiefe this may bring v∣pon
<PB N="131" REF="71"/> them: and therefore they doe resist and withstand it with so great force and vehemencie. The Castillian know∣eth full well the great aduancement and assurance, which would hereof ensue to his estate, if he could reach so farre: and that is the cause, he is so earnest to get himselfe entitled king of Spaine. He is (as we haue before sayd) very expert and well seene in histories, as his predecessors were also be∣fore him: and by reading of them he hath learned that this is the most easie meane and readie way to commaund pea∣ceably, and to gaine the affection of all the Spaniards. Hi∣stories do shew vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Egbert king of West Saxon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in England.</NOTE> how <HI>Egbert</HI> a valiant and magnanimous Prince, being chosen king of the realme of West Saxons in great Brittaine (which Realme contained the prouinces of Cornewall, Deuon, Sommerset, Wiltshire, Dorsetshire, Hampshire, and Barkeshire: and trusting vpon his skill and knowledge in the art military, which hee had learned in Fraunce vnder <HI>Charlemaigne,</HI> where he had beene banished for many years, he resolued to make himselfe King &amp; Lord of all great Brittaine, leauing Scotland apart. And begin∣ning his enterprise, he first subdued the prouince of Wales, which is the strongest of all the rest. After which he wanne the Realmes of Kent, Mercia, Northumberland, and the Realme of the East Saxons, called Essex:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Or rather North Saxon in Norfolke.</NOTE> hauing gotten this prouince, and those foure realmes, <HI>Egbert</HI> seeing himselfe now Lord of fiue, and that there now rested no more to conquer but the Realme of Sussex, so called of the South Saxons, and that of the East Saxons, called East Anglia, of whose forces he made no great reckening. And bethinking with himselfe how he might assure and secure these domini∣ons and Seigniories vnto himselfe, he determined not one∣ly to roote out and extinguish the name and memory of the Brittaines the ancient inhabitants of that Ile, but also gaine the good willes and affections of his subiects, by a new name, and so by that meanes to draw vnto himselfe the resi∣due which remained yet vnconquered. To this effect and purpose he ordained and appointed, and by a perpetuall
<PB N="132" REF="72"/> edict commaunded, that from that day forwards all those seuen Realmes should bee named by one onely name England: and that all the inhabitants should name them∣selues Englishmen.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Egbert the first king of England.</NOTE> And by this meanes hee came readily and fully to the ende of his desire. In imitation of this <HI>Eg∣bert, Fernand</HI> the second king of Arragon, and the fift of that name, king of Castile, seeing himselfe Lord of the grea∣test part of Spaine: and that there rested no more for him to gaine saue onely Nauarre and Portugall, he employed all his forces and endeauours to obtaine from the Princes realmes, and prouinces of Spaine, that which they refused, to wit, that hee might entitle and write himselfe King of Spaine. With the like ambition and desire, <HI>Philip</HI> his great graund-child, pretendeth that the Realmes of Spaine, and now of late Portugall haue constantly resolutely denied him, and which you doe giue him so readily and so liberally. So that now I thinke you will perfectly vnderstand the cause wherefore <HI>Philip</HI> doeth write himselfe King of Castile and of Leon,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Castillians and Castilo what it mea∣neth.</P>

<P>We call them Castilians, which are naturall and borne in the Realme of Castile, and in those Realmes which the kings of Castile (with the aide of the Kings of Nauarre, Ar∣ragon, and Portugall, &amp; other Soueraigne Lords of Spaine) haue gotten and wrested out of the hands and possession of the Moores: all which Realmes wee name <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y one onely name, new Castile. Of these Realmes, that which was the shortest time in the power and puissance of the Moores was the kingdome of Toledo, which was restored to liber∣tie by <HI>Alphonsus</HI> the 6, called the Emperour, in the yeare 1086, hauing bin left vnto them, when Spaine was lost by King <HI>Roderick,</HI> in the yeare 714, so that by this account To∣ledo

For this cause the City of Braga in Portugall, Metropolitan of the Realme of Galicia, and hauing beene alwayes main∣tained against the Moores by the Portugals, the Inhabitants thereof (who at the time when they builded it, were called Galli Bracchati) and where there haue beene Bishops suc∣cessiuely from the beginning of the primitiue Church euen till this time, did heretofore obtaine the primacy of Spaine, and shee doth yet so entitle her selfe, against the consent and liking of the Church of Toledo, which after it came to be restored to her liberty, did againe begin to reuiue and take her former title, and the Archbishops of those places doe yet at this day dispute and contend, whether of them should haue the preheminence.</P>

<P>This being knowne, it is no maruell, as I haue writ∣ten in this Treatise, that the Castilians are descended of the Mores and Iewes, (for these two peoples liue mingled pell mell together) and that the pronunciation of their lan∣guage is after the Morish fashion: seeing that the Mores haue inhabited in that countrie so many hundred of yeares, and doe yet at this present possesse and occupie a great part of Castile.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cities: the meaning thereof.</NOTE>Cities in Spaine, are those peoples wherein Bishops Seas are established. These bee also some cities which by particular priuiledge (albeit they bee not Metropolitanes nor heads of Bishoprickes) doe vse this title and preroga∣tiue: howbeit there bee very few of them. Betweene a Citie and a Towne, there is a great difference, aswell in authoritie, as in prerogatiues, honours and priuiledges. In Cities there are commonly <HI>Corrigidores,</HI> specially in Por∣tugall, who may be resembled to the Pretours and Gouer∣nours of the auncient Romanes, which gouerned the pro∣uinces. One citie hath many townes, peoples, and villages, which are subiects vnto it, aswell in temporall as spirituall matters. In such sort, that the cities are as the heads, and the townes as the members. For this cause when there happe∣neth any great affaires or common reuolt in Spaine, the townes do alwayes follow the party of that city whereunto they are dependant, And to reduce any people into a citie,
<PB N="135" REF="73"/> the antiquitie of the place is more required then the great∣nesse of it. There be many Cities which are but meanely peopled, and Townes which are full and thicke of people. <HI>Valladolid, Medina del Campo, Madril,</HI> and <HI>Caceles</HI> in Castile, <HI>Santaren, Abrantes, Setuuall,</HI> and <HI>Oliuenea</HI> in Por∣tugall, are very great Townes, and notably well peopled, and yet they surpasse in greatnesse many of the Cities: ne∣uerthelesse, they are not for all that endowed with all these prerogatiues, neither are they called Cities. <HI>Valladolid</HI> and <HI>Santaren</HI> are so full of people, that when in Spaine we make comparison of the greatnesse of Cities and of Townes, we say; <HI>Ciudad par ciudad, Lisbona en Portugal: Villa par villa, Ʋalladolid en Castilla: si quieres otra tal, busca Sentaren en Portugal,</HI> that is to say: City for City, Lisbon in Portugall: Towne for Towne: Valladolid in Castile: if you will find any other the like, seeke Santaren in Portugall. It is not many yeeres since that King <HI>Philip</HI> hath honoured the said Towne of <HI>Val<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adolid</HI> with the title of a City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Valladolid made a City, and Bishops Sea by K. Phi∣lip.</NOTE> and hath made it an Episcopall Sea: and that was, both because Valladolid was wonderfull well peopled (as hath beene said) as also because it is one of the most noble and chiefest Townes of Castile, full of g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat and rich buildings, Churches,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King Philip borne in Val∣ladolid. The time of his na∣tiuity.</NOTE> Monaste∣ries, Colledges, principall Houses, and generall Studies: and also because his Maiesty was borne in that Towne the 22 day of May 1527, on a Tuesday about foure houres af∣ter noone.</P>
<P>The Townes in Spaine are best peopled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Townes in Spaine which they be.</NOTE> which haue within their limits and territories many Villages, hamlets, and Houses, and haue their iurisdiction limited and subie∣cted to the Cities. True it is, that there be some Townes, which are the heads of Baylife-wikes and gouernements, as in Portugall, the Towne of Santaren, of the which wee spake before, and the Towne of Tomar, which hath 42 Townes depending of her iurisdiction. These two Townes in Portugall doe precede and haue the preheminence of the place before many Cities, in the publike Assemblies of the
<PB N="136" REF="74"/> Estates of that Kingdome. The Towne of Santaren pre∣cedeth and goeth before 13 Cities, and is preceeded onely of foure, to wit, Lisbon, Coimbi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Ebora, and Puerto, which in Latine is called <HI>Ciuitas Portugallensis.</HI> Santaren in the time of the Romanes was called <HI>Julium Praesidium,</HI> and was a Court Royall, or (as they call it in Fraunce, a Court of Parliament) and was a Colonie of the Romanes. Tomar also at the same time was called Nabantia, and was an ancient City.</P>
