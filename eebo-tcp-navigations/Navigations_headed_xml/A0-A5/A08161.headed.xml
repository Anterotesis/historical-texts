<OPENER><SALUTE><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>IR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I wrote to you at large on Sunday last and haue little to adde since, but am like to haue en∣ough very shortly, I pray God it proue good. The Duke of <HI>Brunswick</HI> was foure dayes since at <HI>Nidda</HI> in the land of <HI>Hessen,</HI> about fiue leagues from <HI>Francfort.</HI> Mounsuor <HI>Tilly</HI> &amp;c. are gone towards him, and if they be once on the same side of the Mayne, there will in all likely hood be blowes between them. Arch-Duke <HI>Leopold</HI> is not gone to the <HI>Gris∣sons,</HI> but doth now assemble his forces a∣gaine, vvith desseigne as vve iudge to be∣siege
<PB N="4" REF="3"/><HI>Hagenaw</HI> againe, or else to fall downe to ioyne vvith his party, neither of vvhich must be suffered by the Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> and he is likely therfore to go to the Arch∣duke we hope to morrow, for as yet he ly∣eth betweene the two riuers by the towne, and is not himselfe well able to stand. This is all we haue here.</P>
<P>From <HI>Ʋienna</HI> we haue that the Diot of <HI>Hungarie</HI> goeth not on the Emperours mind, and that the Turk is like to giue'vs peace here, we haue small signes of one else, and that is a bad one. The King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> to obey his father, is minded a∣gainst his mind to stay here or at <HI>Heydel∣berg,</HI> in expectation of the issue of the trea∣tie at <HI>Brussels. Manheim</HI> the 6. of Iune.</P>

<HEAD>A Copie of the second Letter.</HEAD>
<P>IN my last Letter you know that <HI>Mon∣sieur Tilly</HI> was then marching towards the Duke <HI>Christian</HI> of <HI>Brunswick</HI> then in the land of <HI>Hessen,</HI> not farre from <HI>Frankford.</HI> The Duke soone after tooke <HI>Hoest</HI> a towne and castle of the Elector of <HI>Ments,</HI> stan∣ding vpon the Mayne before <HI>Frankford,</HI> vvhere he had newes that <HI>Tilly</HI> and <HI>Gon∣sales</HI> ioyned and marched to him ouer the Mayne at <HI>Aschburg</HI> vvith an army of 40. m. as was giuen out, I thinke not much lesse then 30. m. yet he resolued to abide it rather then the hazard of a retrait. And they thereupon marched on furiously by <HI>Hanaw</HI> and <HI>Frankford.</HI> The Duke in the meane time prouided himselfe the best he could to receiue them, seeing on the ad∣uantage of the ground, intrenching him∣selfe, and burning the villages by which the enemy vvere to march to him. This done, he sent hether to the Count of
<PB N="4" REF="4"/><HI>Mansfeld,</HI> to let him know in what poshire he stood, and that he would doe the best he could to hold himselfe so, till the Count might march to him, for whose passage, or his owne retreate if he were forced to it, prepared to make a Bridge ouer the <HI>Mayne,</HI> This newes came to the Counte <HI>Mansfield</HI> as Hee was Marching ouer the Rhyne, with desseigne to haue gone to breake the bridge at <HI>Oppenheim,</HI> or that fayling, to haue made some other diuersi∣on on that side, thereby to haue eased the Duke of <HI>Brunswyck,</HI> by giuing <HI>Gonzales</HI> oc∣casion to looke backward. But herevpon Hee the same instant commaunded sixtie troupes of horse to march ouer the Neccar towards the Duke intending to haue follo∣wed himselfe with the rest of his army this day. But we haue this morning newes, that the Duke was beaten yesterday. The maner and measure of it. is yet variously related, but I hope to adde it to this before I close it. In the meane to doe all I may, against the suddayne dispatch of the post, I hear∣tely take leaue rest.</P>

I must close this Letter and yet haue no more certaintie of the defeat of the Duke of <HI>Brunswick,</HI> but that hee never gaue Bat∣tle, but having beene extreamly molested by the Enemies Cannon, who had twelue peeces at least, whereas the Duke had but two: through some confusion among his men hee was forced to retire ouer the Bridge he had made over the Maine, by the breaking whereof, many of his foote were drowned, others cut off being hin∣dred by carriages, they all are lost as well of baggage as munition, saving the Dukes owne wagons, wherein his money was, His Horse escaped well, some ouer the Bridge, other are forced ouer the deepe that they were put to Swimme, by which meanes some number of them also are lost, and among them the Count <HI>Lenestlin</HI> who married Mistresse <HI>Dudly,</HI> thought to bee one, the number can not yet be estimated, but divers came hi∣ther will not beleeue there were aboue one thousand men lost, yet I doubt more, The rest are retyring through the <HI>Bergstrate</HI> hither in great confusion, and I doubt
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>most of the foote will haue cast away their Armes, which is a great vnrepa∣rable losse, whether the Enemie doe pursue them on this side the Mayne or no, is not yet knowne here, But to be sure the Count <HI>Mansfeild</HI> hath drawne out his whole Armie into the <HI>Berge∣strate,</HI> who being fresh we may redeeme losse if the Enemie do follow, the Duke of <HI>Brunswicke</HI> is for himselfe safe for cer∣taine, and extreamely discontented that he fought not.</P>
