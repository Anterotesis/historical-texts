<HEAD>A verie late and great probabilitie <HI>of a passage, by the Northwest</HI> part of America in 58. degrees of Northerly latitude.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>N excellent learned man of portingale, of singuler grauety, authoritie and experience tolde mee very lately, that one <HI>Anus Cortereal,</HI> captayne of the yle of Tercera about the yeere <HI>1574.</HI> which is not aboue eight yeres past, sent a Shippe to dis∣couer the Northwest passage of America, &amp; that the same shippe arriuing on the coast of the saide America in fiftie eyghte degrees of latitude, founde a great entrance exceeding deepe and broade, without all impediment of ice, into whiche they passed aboue twentie leagues, and found it alwaies to trende towarde the South, the lande lying lowe and plaine on ey∣ther side: And that they perswaded them selues verely, that there was a way open into the south sea. But their victailes fayling them, and being but one shippe, they returned backe agayne with ioy. This place seemeth to lie in equal degrees of latitude, with the first entrance of the sounde of Denmark betweene Norway and the head land, called in latin <HI>Cimbro∣rum promontorium,</HI> and therefore like to bee open and naui∣gable a great part of the yeere. And this report may bee well annexed vnto the other eight reasons mentioned in my epi∣stle dedicatorie, for proofe of the likelihood of this passage by the Northwest.</P>

<HEAD>❧ To the right worshipfull and <HI>most vertuous Gentleman master</HI> Phillip Sydney Esquire.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Maruaile not a little (right wor∣shipfull) that since the first disco∣uerie of America (which is nowe full fourescore and tenne yeeres) after so great conquests and plan∣tings of the Spaniardes and Por∣tingales there, that wee of Eng∣lande could neuer haue the grace to set fast footing in such fer∣till and temperate places, as are left as yet vnpossessed of them. But againe when I consider that there is a time for all men, and see the Portingales time to be out of date, &amp; that the nakednesse of the spaniards, and their long hidden secretes are nowe at length espied, whereby they went about to delude the worlde, I conceiue great hope, that the time approcheth and nowe is, that we of England may share and part stakes (if wee will our selues) both with the spaniarde and the Portingale in part of America, and other regions as yet vndiscouered. And surely if there were in vs that desire to aduaunce the honour of our Countrie which ought to bee in euery good man, wee woulde not all this while haue fore∣slowne the possessing of those landes, whiche of equitie and right appertaine vnto vs, as by the discourses that followe shall appeare most plainely. Yea if wee woulde beholde with the eye of pitie howe al our Prisons are pestered and filled with able men to serue their Countrie, which for small roberies are dayly hanged vp in great numbers euen twentie at a clappe out of one iayle (as was seene at the last assises at Rochester) wee woulde hasten and further euery man to his power the deduc∣ting of some Colonies of our superfluous people into those tem∣perate and fertile partes of America, which being within sixe
<PB REF="4"/> weekes sayling of England are yet vnpossessed by any Christians: and seeme to offer themselues vnto vs, stretching neerer vnto her Maiesties Dominions, then to any other part of Europe. Wee reade that the Bees, whē they grow to be too many in their own hiues at home, are wont to bee led out by their Captaines to swarme abroad, and seeke themselues a new dwelling place. If the examples of the Grecians and Carthaginians of olde time, and the practise of our age may not mooue vs, yet let vs learne wisdome of these smal weake and vnreasonable creatures. It chaunced very lately that vpon occasion I had great conference in matters of Cosmographie with an excellent learned man of Portingale, most priuie to all the discoueries of his nation, who wondered that those blessed countries, from the point of Flori∣da Northward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The speech of a learned Portin∣gale.</NOTE> were all this while vnplanted by Christians, pro∣testing with great affection and zeale, that if hee were nowe as young as I (for at this present hee is threescore yeeres of age) hee woulde sel all hee had, being a man of no small wealth and ho∣nour, to furnish a conuenient number of ships to sea for the in∣habiting of those countries, and reducing those gentile people to christianitie.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Master Iohn Barros the causer of the in∣habiting of Bresilia.</NOTE> Moreouer hee added that Iohn Barros their chiefe Cosmographer being moued with the like desire, was the cause that Bresilia was first inhabited by the Portingales: where they haue nine baronies or lordships, &amp; thirtie engennies or su∣ger milles, two or three hundred slaues belonging to eche myll, with a Iudge, and other officers, &amp; a Church: so that euery mill is as it were a little common wealth: and that the countrie was first planted by such men, as for small offences were saued from the rope. This hee spake not onely vnto mee and in my hearing, but also in the presence of a friend of mine, a man of great skill in the Mathematikes. If this mans desire might bee executed, wee might not only for the present time take possession of that good land, but also in short space by Gods grace finde out that shorte and easie passage by the Northwest, which we haue hetherto so long desired, and whereof wee haue many good and more then probable coniectures: a fewe whereof I thinke it not amisse heere to set downe, although your worship knowe them as
<PB REF="4"/> well as my selfe. First therefore it is not to bee forgotten, that Se∣bastian Gabot wrote to master Baptista Ramusius, that he very∣ly beleeued that all the North part of America is diuided into I∣landes. Secondly that master Iohn Verarzanus, which had been thrise on that coast, in an olde excellent mappe, which he gaue to king Henrie the eight, and is yet in the custodie of master Locke, doth so lay it out, as it is to bee seene in the mappe annexed to the end of this boke, beeing made according to Verarzanus plat. Thirdly the story of Gil Gonsalua recorded by Franciscus Lo∣pes de Gomara, which is saide to haue sought a passage by the North west, seemeth to argue and proue the same. Fourthly, in the second relation of Iaques Cartier the 12. Chapter the peo∣ple of Saguinay doe testifie that vpon their coastes Westwarde there is a sea the ende whereof is vnknowne vnto them. Fiftly, in the end of that discourse is added this, as a special remem∣brance, to wit, that they of Canada say that it is a monethes space to saile to a lande where cinamon and cloues are growing. Sixtly, the people of Florida signified vnto Iohn Ribault (as it is expressed in his discourse heerewithall imprinted) that they might saile from the Riuer of May vnto Ceuola and the south sea through their countrie within twentie dayes. Seuenthly, the experience of captaine. Frobisher on the hyther side, and Sir Fraunces Drake on the backe side of America, with the testimo∣nie of Nicolaus and Anthonius Zeni, that Estotilanda is an I∣lande, doth yeelde no small hope thereof. Lastly, the iudge∣ment of the excellent Geographer Gerardus Mercator, which his sonne Rumold Mercator my friende shewed mee in his letters, &amp; drewe out for mee in writing, is not of wise men lightly to bee regarded. His words are these.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The iudgement of Gerardus Mercator of a passage by the Northwest.</NOTE> <HI>Magna tametsi pauca de noua Frobisheri nauigatione scribis, quam miror ante multos annos nō fuisse attentatam. Non enim dubium est, quin recta &amp; bre∣uis via pateat in occidentem Cathaium vs{que}. In quod regnū, si recte nauigationem instituant, nobilissimas totius mundi merces colligent, &amp; multis Gentibus adhuc idololatris Christi nomen communicabunt.</HI> You write (saith hee to his sonne) great matters though very briefly of the newe discouerie
<PB REF="5"/> of Frobisher, which I wonder was neuer these many yeeres heeretofore attempted. For there is no doubt, but that there is a straight and short way open into the West euen vnto Ca∣thay. Into which kingdome, if they take their course aright, they shall gather the most noble merchandise of all the worlde, and shall make the name of Christe to bee knowne vnto many idolatrous and Heathen people. And heere to conclude and shut vp this matter, I haue hearde my selfe of Merchants of cre∣dite that haue liued long in Spaine, that King Phillip hath made a lawe of late that none of his subiectes shall discouer to the Northwardes of fiue and fortie degrees of America:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A lawe made of late by king. Phillip.</NOTE> whiche may bee thought to proceede chiefly of two causes, the one, least passing farther to the North they should discouer the open passage from the south sea to our north sea: the other because they haue not people enough to possesse and keepe that passage, but rather thereby shoulde open a gappe for other nations to passe that way. Certes if hetherto in our owne discoueries we had not beene led with a preposterous desire of seeking ra∣ther gaine then Gods glorie, I assure my self that our labours had taken farre better effecte. But wee forgotte, that Godlinesse is great riches, and that if we first seeke the kingdome of God, al o∣ther thinges will be giuen vnto vs, and that as the light accompa∣nieth the Sunne, and the heate the fire, so lasting riches do waite vpon them that are zealous for the aduauncement of the king∣dome of Christ, and the enlargement of his glorious Gospell: as it is sayde, I will honour them that honour mee. I truste that nowe being taught by their manifolde losses our men will take a more godly course, and vse some part of their goods to his glo∣rie: if not, he will turne euen their couetousnes to serue him, as he hath done the pride and auarice of the Spaniardes and Por∣tingales, who pretending in glorious words that they made their discoueries chiefly to conuert Infidelles to our most holy faith, (as they say) in deed and truth sought not them, but their goods and riches. Whiche thing that our nation may more speedily &amp; happily performe, there is no better meane in my simple iudge mēt then the increase of knowledge in the arte of nauigation, &amp;
<PB REF="5"/> breading of skilfulnesse in the sea men: whiche Charles the Em∣perour and the king of Spaine that nowe is wisely considering haue in their Contractation house in Siuill<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cōtractatiō house at Siuill.</NOTE> appointed a learned reader of the sayde art of Nauigation, and ioyned with him cer∣tayne examiners, and haue distinguished the orders among the sea men, as the groomet whiche is the basest degree, the mar∣riner which is the seconde, the master the thirde, and the pilote the fourth, vnto the which two last degrees none is admitted without hee haue heard the reader for a certaine space (which is commonly an excellent Mathematician, of which number were Pedro di Medina which writte learnedly of the art of nauigation, and Alonso di Chauez &amp; Hieronimus di Chauez, whose works likewise I haue seene) and being founde fitte by him and his as∣sistantes, which are to examine matters touching experience, they are admitted with as great solemnitie and giuing of presents to the ancient masters and Pilots, and the reader and examiners, as the great doctors in the Vniuersities, or our great Sergeantes at the law when they proceed, and so are admitted to take charge for the Indies. And that your worshippe may knowe that this is true, Master Steuen Borrows,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Steuen Borrowes.</NOTE> nowe one of the foure masters of the Queenes nauie, tolde me that newely after his returne from the discouery of Moscouie by the North, in Queene Maries daies, the Spaniards, hauing intelligence that he was master in that dis∣couerie, tooke him into their cōtractation house at their making and admitting of masters and pilots, giuing him great honour, &amp; presented him with a payre of perfumed gloues woorth fiue or sixe Ducates. I speake all this to this ende, that the like order of erecting such a Lecture<NOTE PLACE="marg">A lecture of the art of nauigatiō necessarie for to be erected in London.</NOTE> here in London or about Ratcliffe in some conuenient place, were a matter of great consequence and importance, for the sauing of many mens liues and goods, which nowe through grosse ignorance are dayly in great hazerd, to the no small detriment of the whole realme. For whiche cause I haue dealt with the right worshipfull sir Frances Drake, that see∣ing God hath blessed him so wonderfully, he woulde do this hon¦nour to him selfe and benefite to his countrey, to bee at the cost to erecte such a lecture: Whereunto in most bountifull maner
<PB REF="6"/> at the verie first he answered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The bountiful offer of sir Frā∣cis Drake to∣ward furthering the art of Naui∣gation.</NOTE> that he liked so well of the motion, that he woulde giue twentie poundes by the yeere standing, and twentie poundes more before hand to a learned man to furnish him with instruments and maps, that woulde take this thing vp∣on him: yea so readie he was that he earnestly requested mee to helpe him to the notice of a fitte man for that purpose, which I, for the zeale I bare to this good actiō, did presently, &amp; brought him one, who came vnto him &amp; conferred with him thereupon: but in fine he would not vndertake the lecture, vnlesse he might haue fourtie pounde a yeere standing, and so the matter ceased for that time: howebeit the worthie and good Knight remaineth full constant, and will be, as he told me very lately, as good as his worde. Nowe if God shoulde put into the head of any noble man to contribute other twentie pounde, to make this lecture a competent liuing for a learned man, the whole realme no doubt might reape no small benefite thereby. To leaue this matter &amp; to drawe to an ende, I haue heare right worshipfull in this hastie worke first put downe the title which we haue to that part of A∣merica which is from Florida to 67. degrees northwarde, by the letters patentes graunted to Iohn Gabote and his three sonnes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ihon Gabote and his three sonnes.</NOTE> Lewes, Sebastian, and Santius, with Sebastians owne Certificate to Baptista Ramusius of his discouerie of America, and the testi∣monie of Fabian our own Chronicler. Next I haue caused to bee added the letters of M. Robert Thorne to King Henrie the eight, and his discourse to his Ambassadour doctor Ley in Spaine of the like argument, with the kings setting out of two ships for disco∣uerie in the 19. yere of his raigne. Thē I haue translated the voy∣age of Iohn Verarzanus from thirtie degrees to Cape Briton, (&amp; the last yeere at my charges, and other of my friendes by my ex∣hortation, I caused Iaques Cartiers two voyages of discoue∣ring the grand Bay, and Canada, Saguinay, and Hochelaga to bee translated out of my Volumes, which are to be annexed to this present translation). Moreouer following the order of the map, and not the course of time, I haue put downe the discourse of Nicholaus and Antonius Zenie. The last treatise of Iohn Ri∣bault, is a thing that hath been alreadie printed, but not nowe to
<PB REF="6"/> be had, vnlesse I had caused it to be printed againe.

And also of other partes of the Indies <HI>and rich Countries to bee discouered, which the wor∣shipfull master Robert Thorne merchant of Lon∣don</HI> (who dwelt long in the City of Siuil in Spaine) exhorted king Henrie the eight to take in hande. MOST EXCELLENT PRINCE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">E</SEG>Xperience proueth that natural∣ly all Princes bee desirous to ex∣tend and enlarge their domini∣ons and kingdomes. Wherfore it is not to bee maruelled, to see them euery day procure y<SUP>e</SUP> same, not regarding any cost, perill, and labour, that may thereby chaunce, but rather it is to bee marueiled, if there be any prince content to liue quiet with his owne dominions. For sure∣ly the people would thinke he lacketh the noble courage and spirit of all other. The worlde knoweth that the desires of Princes haue beene so feruent to obtaine their purpose, that they haue aduentured and proued things to mans con∣iecture impossible, the which they haue made possible, and al∣so things difficult haue made facil, and thus to obtaine their purpose haue in maner turned vp and downe the whole worlde so many times, that the people inhabiting in the far∣thest regiō of the occident haue pursued with great desires, labours and perils, to penetrate and enter into the farthest regions of the Orient: And in likewise those people of the said partes of the Orient haue had no lesse labour and desire to enter and penetrate into the farthest land of the Occident, and so following their purchase haue not seased vntill they
<PB REF="12"/> could passe no farther by reason of the great Seas. This naturall inclination is cause, that scarsely it may bee saide there is any kingdome stable, nor king quiet, but that his owne imagination, or other Princes his neighbours doe trouble him. God and nature hath prouided to your Grace, and to your Gracious progenitors this Realme of Eng∣lande, and set it in so fruitefull a place, and within suche li∣mites, that it shoulde seeme to bee a place quiet and aparted from all the foresaide desires. One speciall cause is, for that it is compassed with the Sea: by reason thereof it seemes, this notwithstanding, their desires and noble cou∣rages haue been most commonly like vnto others: and with marueilous great labours, costes and perilles, they haue tra∣uelled and passed the Seas making warre not onely with kings and dominions nigh neighbours, but also with them of farre countries, and so hath wonne and conquered many riche and faire Dominions, and amplifted this your Graces Realme with great victorie and glory. And also nowe of late your Grace hauing like courage and desire, &amp; not with∣out iust cause, to enlarge this your kingdome and demaund your limites and tribute of the French king, which at that present hee restrained your Grace in person passed with a great power into France, putting your Graces person to great paine and labour, and without doubt victoriously you had conquered the saide Realme of Fraunce, as yee began; if your aduersarie had not reconciled him, and knowledged your Graces right and title: and so promised truely to pay the tribute then due, and fulfill your request in all thinges, and also desired your Grace for peace, the which of your cle∣mencie you could not refuse.</P>
<P>Nowe I considering this your noble courage and desire, &amp; also perceiuing that your Grace may at your plea∣sure, to your greater glory, by a godly meane, with litle cost, perill, or labour to your Grace or any of your Subiectes, amplifie and inriche this your saide Realme, I knowe it is my bounde dutie to manifest this secrete vnto your Grace,
<PB REF="12"/> which hitherto as I suppose hath beene hid:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> which is that with a small number of shippes there may bee discouered diuers newe landes and kingdomes, in the whiche without doubt your Grace shall winne perpetuall glory and your Subiects infinite profite. To which places there is left one way to discouer, which is into the North: For that of the foure parts of the worlde it seemeth three partes are discouered by other Princes. For out of Spaine they haue discouered all the Indies and Seas Occidentall, and out of Portugale all the Indies and Seas Oriental: So that by this part of the Orient and Occident, they haue compassed the worlde. For the one of them departing to∣warde the Orient, and the other towarde the Occident, met againe in the course or way of the middest of the day, and so then was discouered a great part of the same Seas and coastes by the Spaniardes. So that nowe rest to bee dis∣couered the saide North partes, the which it seemeth to mee, is onely your charge and duetie. Because the si∣tuation of this your Realme is thereunto neerest and ap∣test of all other:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> and also for that you haue alreadie taken it in hande: And in mine opinion, it will not seeme well to leaue so great and profitable an enterprise, seeing it may so easily and with so little coste, labour, and daunger, bee followed and obteined: Though heeretofore your Grace hath made theereof a proofe, and founde not the commoditie thereby as you trusted, at this time it shall bee no impediment. For there may bee nowe prouided remedies for thinges, then lacked, and the inconuenien∣ces and lettes remooued that then were cause your Gra∣ces desire tooke no full effect, which is, the courses to be chaunged, and followe the aforesaid new courses. And con∣cerning the marriners, shippes, and prouision, an order may be deuised and taken meete and conuenient much better then hetherto. By reason whereof, and by Gods grace, no doubt your purpose shall take effect. Surely the coste heerein will bee nothing, in comparison to the great profite.
<PB REF="13"/> The labour is much lesse, yea nothing at all, where so great honour and glory is hoped for: and considering well the courses, truly the dāger &amp; way is shorter to vs, thē to spaine or Portugall, as by euident reasons appeareth. And nowe to declare some thing of the commoditie and vtilitie of this Nauigation and discouering,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> it is very cleere and certaine, that the Seas that commonly men say, that with∣out great danger, difficultie and perill, yea rather it is im∣possible to passe, those same Seas bee nauigable and with∣out any such daunger, but that shippes may passe and haue in them perpetuall cleerenesse of the day without any dark∣nesse of the night: which thing is a great commoditie for the nauigants, to see at all tunes rounde about them, as well the safegardes as daungers, and howe great difference it is betweene the commoditie and perilles of other which lease the most parte of euery foure and twentie houres the saide light, and goe in darkenesse groping their way, I thincke there is none so ignorant but perceiueth this more plainely, then it can bee expressed: yea what a vantage shall your Graces Subiects haue also by this light to discouer the strange landes, countries, and coastes, for if they that bee discouered to sayle by them in darkenesse is with great danger, muche more then the coastes not discouered be dan∣gerous to trauell by night or in darkenesse. Yet these dangers or darknesse hath not letted the Spaniardes and Portingals and other, to discouer many vnknowen realmes to their great perill, which considered (and that your Gra∣ces Subiectes maye haue the saide lighte) it will seeme your Graces subiects to bee without actiuitie or courage, in leauing to doe this glorious and noble enterprise. For they being past this little way which they named so dangerous, which may bee ii, or iii. leagues before they come to y<SUP>e</SUP> Pole, and as much more after they passe the Pole, it is cleere that from thence foorth the Seas and landes are as temperat as in these partes, &amp; that then it may be at the will and plea∣sure of the marriners, to choose whether they will saile by y<SUP>e</SUP>
<PB REF="13"/> coastes that bee colde, temperate, or hot. For they being past the pole, it is plaine they maye decline to what parte they list. If they will goe towarde the Orient they shall inioy the regions of all the Tartarians that extende towarde the mid∣day, and from thence they may goe and proceede to the lande of y<SUP>e</SUP> Chinas, &amp; from thence to the lande of Cathaio oriental, which is of all the mayne lande most orientall that can bee reckoned from our habitation. And if from thence they doe continue their nauigation, following the coaste that returns towarde the occident, they shall fall in Melassa, and so in all the Indees which we call orientall, and following that way may returne hither by the Cape of <HI>Bona Speransa:</HI> and thus they shall compasse the whole worlde. And if they will take their course after they be past the pole, towarde the occident, they shall goe in the backe side of the new found lande, which of late was discouered by your Graces subiectes, vntill they come to the backside and South seas of the Indees occi∣dentalls. And so continuing their viage they may returne thorowe the straite of <HI>Magallanas</HI> to this countrey, and so they compasse also the worlde by that way, and if they goe this thirde way, and after they bee past the pole, goe right to∣warde the pole Antartike, and then decline toward the lands and Ilands situated betweene the Tropikes, and vnder the Equinoctial, without doubt they shal find there y<SUP>e</SUP> richest lāds and Ilands of the worlde of Golde, precious stones, balmes, spices, and other thinges that wee here esteeme most: which come out of strang countreys, &amp; may returne the same way.</P>
<P>By this it appeareth your Grace haue not onely a greate aduantage of the riches, but also your subiectes shall not tra∣uell halfe of the way that other doe, which goe rounde a∣bout as aforesaide.</P>

For such things haue oftē times happened in this coun∣trey.</P>
<P>Also to write to your Lordshippe of the newe trade of spicerie of the Emperour, there is no doubt but that the I∣landes are fertile of cloues, nutmegs, mace, and cinnamon: And that the saide Ilandes, with other there about, abounde w<SUP>t</SUP> gold, Rubies, Diamonds, Balasses, Granates, iacincts &amp; other stones &amp; pearles, as al other lāds, that are vnder &amp; nere y<SUP>e</SUP> equinoctial. For we see, where nature giueth any thing, she is no nigarde. For as with vs and other, that are aparted from the sayde equinoctiall, our mettalles be lead, tynne, and yron, so theirs be golde, siluer, and copper. And as our fruites and graines be aples, nuttes, and corne, so theirs bee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ates, nutmegges, pepper, cloues, and other spices. And as
<PB REF="14"/> wee haue iette, amber, cristall, iasper, and other like stones, so haue they rubies, diamonds, balasses, saphires, Iacincts, and other like. And though some say that of such precious mettals, graines or kind of spices, and precious stones, the a∣boundance and quantitie is nothing so great, as our mettals, fruites or stones aboue rehearsed: yet if it be well considered, how the quantitie of the earth vnder the equinoctiall to both the tropicall lines, (in which space is founde the said golde, spices and precious stones) to be as much in quantitie, as al∣most all the earth from the tropickes to both the poles: it can not be denied but there is more quantitie of the said mettels, fruites, spices, and precious stones, then there is of the other mettels and other thinges before rehearsed. And I see that the preciousnesse of these thinges is measured after the distance that is betweene vs, and the things that we haue ap∣petite vnto. For in this nauigation of the spicerie was disco∣uered, that these Ilandes nothing set by golde, but set more by a knife and a nayle of yron, then by his quantitie of Golde: and with reason, as the thing more necessarie for mans ser∣uice. And I doubt not but to them shoulde bee as precious our corne and seedes, if they might haue them, as to vs their spices: and likewise the peeces of glasse that heare wee haue counterfayted are as precious to them, as to vs their stones: which by experience is seene daylie by them that haue trade thither. This of the riches of those countries is sufficient.</P>
<P>Touching that your Lordship wrote, whether it may be profitable to the Emperour or no, it may be without doubte of great profit: if as the king of Portingall doth, he woulde become a marchant, and prouide shippes and their lading, and trade thither alone, and defende the trade of these Ilands for himselfe. But other greater busines withholdeth him from this. But still, as nowe it is begunne to bee occupied, it would come to much. For the ships comming in safetie, there would thither many euery yeere, of whiche to the Empe∣rour is due of all the wares and Iuelles that come from
<PB REF="15"/> thence the fift part for his custome cleare without any cost. And besides this he putteth in euery flote a certayn quantitie of money, of whiche hee enioyeth of the gaines pounde and poundes like as other aduenturers doe. In a flote of three shippes and a carauell that went from this citie armed by the marchauntes of it, which departed in Aprill last past, I and my partener haue <HI>1400.</HI> Ducates that we employed in the sayde fleete,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> principally for that two Englishmen friends of mine, whiche are somewhat learned in Cosmographie, shoulde goe in the same shippes, to bring mee certaine relati∣on of the situation of the countrey, and to bee experte in the Nauigation of those seas, and there to haue informations of many other things, and aduise that I desire to know especi∣ally. Seeing in these quarters are shippes, and marriners of that countrey, and cardes by which they sayle, though much vnlike ours: that they should procure to haue the said Cards, and learne howe they vnderstande them, and especially to know what Nauigation they haue for those Ilandes North∣wardes, and Northeastwarde.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE>For if from the sayde Ilandes the Sea do extende, without interposition of lande, to sayle from the North poynt to the Northeast poynt <HI>1700.</HI> or <HI>1800.</HI> leagues, they should come to the Newe founde Ilandes that wee discouered, and so wee shoulde bee neerer to the sayde spicerie by almost <HI>2000.</HI> leagues then the Emperour, or the king of Portingal are. And to aduise your Lordshippe whether of these spice∣ries of the King of Portingal or the Emperours is neerer, and also of the titles that eyther of them hath, and howe our Newe founde landes are parted from it, (for that by writyng without some demonstration, it were harde to giue any declaration of it,) I haue caused that your Lorde∣shippe shall receyue herewith a little Mappe or Carde of the worlde: the whiche, I feare mee, shall put your Lord∣shippe to more labour to vnderstande, then mee to make it, only for that it is made in so little roome that it cannot be but obscurely set out, y<SUP>t</SUP> is desired to be seene in it, &amp; also for y<SUP>t</SUP> I am in this science litle expert: Yet to remedy in part this
<PB REF="15"/> difficultie, it is necessary to declare to your Lordshippe my intent, with which I trust you shal perceiue in this card part of your desire, if, for that I cannot expresse mine intent, with my declaratiō I doe not make it more obscure.</P>
<P>First, your Lordship knoweth that the Cosmographers haue deuided the earth by <HI>360.</HI> degrees in latitude, and as many in longitude, vnder the which is comprehended al the roundnesse of the earth: the latitude beeing deuided into <HI>4.</HI> quarters, ninetie degrees amount to euerie quarter, which they measure by the altitude of the poles, that is the North and South starres, beeing from the line equinoctiall till they come right vnder the Noth starre the saide ninetie de∣grees: and asmuche from the sayde line equinoctiall to the South starre bee other ninetie degrees. And asmuche more is also from eyther of the saide starres agayne to the equinoctiall. Which imagined to be rounde, is soone perceiued thus, <HI>360.</HI> degrees of latitude to be consumed in the said foure quarters, of ninetie degrees a quarter, so that this latitude is the measure of the worlde from North to South, and from South to North. And the longitude, in which are also counted other <HI>360.</HI> is counted frō West to East, or from East to West, as in the card is set. The said latitude your Lordship may see marked and deuided in the end of this carde on the left hande.<NOTE PLACE="marg">To know the latitudes.</NOTE> So that if you woulde know in what degrees of latitude any region or coast stan∣deth, take a compasse and set the one foote of the same in the equinoctiall line right against the said region, and apply the other foote of the compasse to the saide region or coast, and then set the sayd compasse at the ende of the carde, where the degrees are deuided. And the one foote of the cōpasse stan∣ding in the line equinoctiall, the other will shewe in the scale the degrees of altitude or latitude that the sayd region is in. Also the longitude of the worlde I haue set out in the nether part of the carde, contayning also <HI>360.</HI> degrees: which begin to be coūted after Ptolome and other Cosmo∣graphers from an head land called <HI>Capo verde,</HI> which is o∣uer against a little crosse made in the part occidentall, where
<PB REF="16"/> the diuision of the degrees beginneth, &amp; endeth in y<SUP>e</SUP> same <HI>Ca∣po verde.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">To knowe the Longitudes.</NOTE> Nowe to knowe in what longitude any lande is, your Lordeshippe must take a ruler or a compasse, and set the one foote of the compasse vpon the lande or coast whose longitude you woulde knowe, and extende the other foote of the compasse to the nexte parte of one of the trans∣uersall lines in the Orientall or Occidentall part: which done, set the one foote of the compasse in the saide trans∣uersall lyne at the ende of the nether scale, the scale of longitude, and the other foote sheweth the degree of lon∣gitude that the region is in. And your Lordshippe must vnderstande that this carde though little conteyneth the vniuersall whole worlde betwixte the twoo collaterall lines, the one in the Occidentall parte descendeth perpen∣dicular vppon the <HI>175.</HI> degree, and the other in the Orientall on the <HI>170.</HI> degree, whose distaunce measu∣reth the scale of longitude. And that whiche is without the two sayde transuersall lynes is onely to shew howe the Oriental part is ioyned with the Occident, &amp; Occident with the Orient. For that that is set without the line in the Ori∣ent parte, is the same that is set within the other line in the Occidentall parte: and againe that that is sette without the line in the Occidentall part, is the same that is set with∣in the line on the Orientall parte: To shewe that though this figure of the worlde in playne or flat seemeth to haue an ende, yet one imagining that this sayde carde were set vpon a round thing, where the endes shoulde touche by the lines, it would plainely appeare howe the Orient part ioy∣neth with the Occident, as there without the lines it is de∣scribed &amp; figured. And for more declaration of the said card, your Lordship shall vnderstand, that beginning on the parte Occidentall within the lyne, the first land that is set out, is y<SUP>e</SUP> mayne land &amp; Iland of the Indies of y<SUP>e</SUP> Emperour. Which mayne lande or coast goeth Northwarde, and finisheth in the lande that wee founde, whiche is called heere <HI>Terra de Labrador.</HI> So that it appeareth the sayde lande that wee founde and the Indies to bee all one mayne lande. The
<PB REF="16"/> sayd coast from the saide Indies Southwarde, as by the carde your Lordshippe may see, cōmeth to a certaine straite sea called <HI>Estrecho de todos Sanctos:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Now called the streit of Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣lane.</NOTE> by which straite Sea the Spaniardes goe to the spiceries, as I shall declare more at large: the which straite sea is right against the three hundred fifteene degrees of Longitude, and is of Latitude or altitude from the Equinoctiall fiftie three de∣grees. The first lande from the sayd beginning of the carde towarde the Orient is certaine Ilandes of the Canaries &amp; Ilandes of <HI>Capo verde.</HI> But the first mayne lande next to the line Equinoctiall is the sayde <HI>Capo verde,</HI> and from thence northwarde by the streite of this sea of Italie. And so followeth Spayne, Fraunce, Flaunders, Almaine, Denmarke and Norway, which is the highest parte tow∣ard the North. And ouer against Flaunders are our Ilands of England and Irelande. Of the landes and coastes with∣in the straites I haue set out onelye the Regions, deui∣ding them by lynes of their lymittes, by whiche playnelie I thinke your Lordship may see, in what situatiō euery re∣gion is, and of what highnesse, &amp; with what regions it is ioy∣ned. I doe thinke few are lefte out of all Europe. In the partes of Asia and Affrica I could not so well make the said diuisions: for that they be not so well knowen, nor neede not so muche. This I write because in the sayde carde bee made the sayde lynes and strikes, that your Lordshippe should vnderstande wherefore they doe serue. Also returning to foresayde <HI>Capo verde</HI> the coast goeth Southwarde to a cape called <HI>Capo de bona speransa:</HI> which is right ouer agaynst the sixtye and sixtie fifte degree of Longitude. And by this cape goe the Portingales to their spicerie. For from this cape towarde the Orient, is the Lande of <HI>Calicut,</HI> as your Lordshippe may see in the head lande o∣uer against the <HI>130.</HI> degree. From the said cape of <HI>Bona Spe∣ransa</HI> the coast returneth toward the line Equinoctiall, and passing foorth entreth the read sea, &amp; returning out entreth againe into the gulfe of Persia, and returneth towarde the Equinoctiall line, till that it commeth to the head∣land
<PB REF="17"/> called Callicut afore saide, and from thence the coast making a Gulfe, where is the riuer of Ganges, returneth towarde the line to a head lande called Malacha, where is the principall spicerie: And from this cape returneth and maketh a great gulfe, and after the coast goeth right toward the Orient, and ouer against this last gulfe and coast be ma∣nie Ilandes, which be Ilandes of the spiceries of the Empe∣rour. Vpon which the Portingales and he be at vartaunce. The said coast goeth towarde the Orient, and endeth right against the <HI>155.</HI> degrees, and after returneth toward the oc∣cident Northwarde: which coast not yet plainely knowne I may ioyn to the new found land found by vs, that I spake of before. So that I finishe with this a briefe declarati∣on of the carde aforesayde. Well I knowe I shoulde also haue declared how the coastes within the streites of the Sea of Italie runne. It is plaine that passing the streites on the Northside of that Sea after the coast of Granado, and with that which pertaynes to Spayne, is the coast of that which Fraunce hath in Italie. And then followeth in one peece all Italie, which lande hath an arme of a sea with a gulfe which is called <HI>Mare Adriaticum.</HI> And in the bottome of this gulfe is the citie of Venice. And on the other part of the said gulfe is Sclauonia, and nexte Grecia, then the streites of Constantinople, and then the Sea called <HI>Euximus,</HI> which is within the saide streites: And com∣ming out of the said straits floweth toward Turcia ma∣ior. (Though now on both sides it is called Turcia.) And so the coast runneth Southward to Syria, and ouer against the said Turcia are the Ilādes of Rhodes, Candie, and Cy∣prus. And ouer against Italie are the Ilandes of Sicilia &amp; Sardinia. And ouer against Spaine is Maiorca and minor∣ca. In the ende of the gulfe of Syria is Iudea. And from thence returneth the coast toward the Occident, till it com∣meth to the streites where wee beganne, whiche all is the coast of Affricke or Barbarie. Also your Lordshippe shall vnderstande that the coastes of the Sea throughout all the world I haue coloured with yellow; for that it may appeare
<PB REF="17"/> that all that is within the line coloured yellow, is to be ima∣gined to be mayne land or Iland: and all without the sayde line so coloured to bee Sea: whereby it is easie and light to know it. Albeit in this little roome any other description would rather haue made it obscure then cleere. Also the sayd coasts of the Sea are all set iustly after the manner &amp; forme as they lye, as the nauigation approoueth thē throughout all the carde, saue onely the coastes and Iles of the spicerie of y<SUP>e</SUP> Emperour which is from ouer against the <HI>160.</HI> to the <HI>215.</HI> degrees of Longitude. For these coastes &amp; situations of the Ilands euery of the Cosinographers and pilots of Portin∣gall and Spayne doe set after their purpose. The Spani∣ards more towards the Orient, because they should appeare to appertaine to the Emperour: and the Portingalles more toward the Occident, for that they should fall within their iurisdiction. So that the Pilots &amp; nauigants thither, which in such cases should declare y<SUP>e</SUP> truth, by their industrie doe set thē falsely euery one to fauour his prince. And for this cause can be no certaine situatiō of y<SUP>e</SUP> coast &amp; Ilands, til this diffe∣rence betwixte them be verified. Nowe to come to the purpose of your Lordshippes demaunde touching the diffe∣rence betweene the Emperour and the king of Portingall, to vnderstād it better, I must declare y<SUP>e</SUP> beginning of this dis∣couering. Though peraduēture your Lordship may say y<SUP>t</SUP> in that I haue writtē ought of purpose I fall in the Prouerbe, <HI>A gemino ouo bellum:</HI> But your Lordship commaunded me to be large, &amp; I take licence to be prolixouse, &amp; shalbe perad∣uenture tedious, but your Lordship knoweth that <HI>nihil igno∣rantia verbosius.</HI> In the yeere <HI>1484.</HI> the king of Portingal minded to arme certaine caruelles to discouer this spicery. Then forasmuch as he feared that being discouered euerie other prince would send &amp; trade thither, so y<SUP>t</SUP> the cost &amp; peril of discouering should be his, &amp; the profite common: where∣fore first he gaue knowledge of this his mynd to al princes christened, saying y<SUP>t</SUP> he would seeke amōgst y<SUP>e</SUP> infidels newe possessiōs of regions, &amp; therfore would make a certain army: &amp; y<SUP>t</SUP> if any of thē would help in y<SUP>e</SUP> cost of y<SUP>e</SUP> said army he should
<PB REF="18"/> enioy his parte of the profite or honour that shoulde come of it. And as then this discouering was holden for a straunge thing and vncertaine. Nowe they say, that all the Princes of Christendome aunsweared that they woulde bee no part of such an army, nor yet of the profite y<SUP>t</SUP> might come of it. After the which he gaue knowledge to the Pope of his purpose, &amp; of the answere of all the Princes, desiring him y<SUP>t</SUP> seeing that none would helpe in the costes, that hee woulde iudge all that shoulde bee founde and discouered to be of his iurisdiction, and commaund that none other Princes should intermeddle therewith. The Pope saide not as Christ saith, <HI>Quis me constituit iudicem inter vos?</HI> He did not refuse, but making him selfe as Lorde and Iudge of all, not only graū∣ted that all that should be discouered from Oriēt to Occidēt should be the kings of Portingall, but also, that vpon great censures no other Prince should discouer but he: And if they did, all to be the kinges of Portingall. So he armed a fleete, and in the yeere <HI>1487.</HI> was discouered y<SUP>t</SUP> Ilands of <HI>Calicut,</HI> from whence is brought all the spice he hath. After this in the yeere <HI>1492.</HI> the king of Spaine willing to discouer landes towarde the Occident without making any such di∣ligence, or taking licence of the king of Portingale, armed certayne caruelles, and then discouered this India Occiden∣tall, especially two Ilandes of the saide India, that in this carde I set foorth named the one <HI>Ladominica,</HI> and the other <HI>Cuba,</HI> and brought certaine gold from thence. Of the which when the king of Portingall had knowledge, he sent to the king of Spayne, requiring him to giue him y<SUP>e</SUP> said Ilands. For that by the sentence of the Pope all that should be disco∣uered was his, and that he should not proceede further in the discouerie without his licence. And at the same time it see∣meth that out of <HI>Castill,</HI> into Portingale had gone for feare of burning infinite number of Iewes that were expelled out of Spayne, for that they would not turne to be Christians, &amp; carried with thē infinite number of gold &amp; siluer. So that it seemeth that the king of Spayne answered that it was reasō that the king of Portingall asked, and that to bee obedient to
<PB REF="18"/> that which the pope had decreed, he would giue him the said Ilands of the Indies. Now for as much as it was decreed betwixt y<SUP>e</SUP> said kings, y<SUP>t</SUP> none should receiue y<SUP>e</SUP> others subiects fugitiues, nor their goodes, therefore the king of Portingale should pay and returne to the king of Spaine a million of Golde or more, that the Iewes had carried out of Spaine to Portingale; and that so doing he would giue these Ilandes and desist from any more discouering. And not fulfilling this he would not onely not giue these Ilands, but procure to discouer more where him thought best. It seemeth that the king of Portingale would not or could not with his ease pay this mony. And so not paying that he coulde not let the king of Spaine to discouer: so that hee enterprised not to∣ward the Orient where he had begun and found the spicery. And consented to the king of Spaine that touching this dis∣couering they should deuide the worlde betweene them two. And that all that should be discouered frō <HI>Capo verde,</HI> where this carde beginneth to be counted in the degrees of longi∣tude, to <HI>180.</HI> of the sayde scale of longitude, which is halfe the worlde toward the Orient, and finisheth in this carde right ouer against a little crosse made at the sayde <HI>180.</HI> de∣grees, to be the king of Portingalles. And all the lande from the sayde Crosse towarde the Occident, vntill it ioyneth with the other Crosse in the Orient, which contei∣neth the other hundreth and eightie degrees, that is the other halfe of the worlde, to bee the king of Spaynes. So that from the lande ouer agaynst the sayde hundreth and eightie degrees vntill it finish in the three hundred and sixtie on both the endes of the carde, is the iurisdicti∣on of the king of Spayne. So after this manner they deuided the worlde betweene them. Nowe for that these Ilandes of spicerie fall neere the terme and lymites be∣tweene these Princes (for as by the sayde carde you maye see they beginne from one hundred and sixtie degrees of Longitude, and ende in <HI>215.</HI>) it seemeth all that falleth from <HI>160.</HI> to <HI>180.</HI> degrees, shoulde bee of Portingall:
<PB REF="19"/> and all the rest of Spayne. And for that their Cosmogra∣phers and Pilots could not agree in the situation of the said Ilands (for the Portingals set them al within their <HI>180.</HI> de∣grees, and the Spaniards set them all without: &amp; for that in measuring, all the Cosmographers of both partes, or what other that euer haue beene cānot giue certaine order to measure y<SUP>e</SUP> lōgitude of the world,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The longitudes harde to be founde out.</NOTE> as they do of y<SUP>e</SUP> latitude: for y<SUP>t</SUP> there is no starre fixed frō East to West, as are y<SUP>e</SUP> starrs of the poles from North to South, but all mooueth with the mouing diuine:) no māner can be found how certainely it may be measured, but by coniectures, as the Nauigantes haue esteemed the way they haue gone. But it is manifest that Spayne had the situation of all the landes from <HI>Capo verde,</HI> towarde the Orient of the Portingales to their <HI>180.</HI> degrees. And in all their cardes they neuer hitherto set the sayd Ilands within their limitatiō of the sayd <HI>180.</HI> degrees: (Though they knew very well of the Ilandes,) til nowe that the Spaniards discouered them. And it is knowne that the king of Portingale had trade to these Ilands afore, but would neuer suffer Portingale to goe thither from <HI>Calicut:</HI> for so much as hee knewe that it fell out of his dominion: least by going thither there might come some knowledge of those other Ilandes of the king of Spayne, but bought the cloues of Merchauntes of that countrie, that brought them to <HI>Calicut,</HI> much deerer then they would haue cost, if he had sēt for thē, thinking after this maner it would abide alwaies secrete. And now that it is discouered he sendes and keepes the Spanierds from the trade all that he can. Also it should see me that when this foresaide consent of the diuision of the worlde was agreed of betweene them, the king of Por∣tingale had alreadye discouered certayne Ilandes that lye ouer against <HI>Capo verde,</HI> and also certayne parte of the mayne lande of India towarde the South, from whence he fet Brasill, and called it the lande of Brasill. So for that all shoulde come in his terme and limites, bee tooke three hundred and seuentie leagues beyonde
<PB REF="19"/> <HI>Capo verde:</HI> and after this, his <HI>180.</HI> degrees, being his part of the worlde, shoulde beginne in the Carde right ouer a∣gainst the <HI>340</HI> degrees, where I haue made a little com∣passe with a crosse, and shoulde finishe at the <HI>160.</HI> degree, where also I haue made an other little marke. And after this computation without any controuersie, the Ilandes of the spicerie fall out of the Portingales domination. So that nowe the Spaniardes say to the Portingales that if they woulde beginne their <HI>180.</HI> degrees from the saide <HI>Capo verde,</HI> to the intent they shoulde extende more towarde the o∣riente, and so to touche those Ilandes of the spicerie of the Emperour, which is all that is betweene the two crosses made in this carde, that then the Ilandes of <HI>Capo verde</HI> and the lande of Brasill that the Portingales nowe obtaine, is out of the sayde limitation, and that they are of the Empe∣rours. Or if their <HI>180.</HI> degrees they count from the <HI>370.</HI> leagues beyonde the sayde <HI>Capo verde,</HI> to include in it the sayde Ilandes and landes of Brasill, then plainely appea∣reth the saide <HI>180.</HI> degrees shoulde finishe longe before they come to these Ilandes of the spicerie of the Emperour: As by this Carde your Lordeshippe may see. For their li∣mittes shoulde beginne at the <HI>340.</HI> degrees, of this Carde, and ende at <HI>160.</HI> degrees, where I haue made two little marks of the compasse with crosses in them.</P>
<P>So that plainely it shoulde appeare by reason, that the Portingales shoulde leaue these Ilandes of <HI>Capo verde</HI> and land of Brasill, if they would haue part of the spicerie of the Emperours: or else holding these, they haue no parte there. To this the Portingales say, that they will beginne their <HI>180.</HI> degrees from the selfe same <HI>Capo verde:</HI> for that it maye extende so muche more towarde the oriente and touche these Ilandes of the Emperours: and woulde winne these Ilandes of <HI>Capo verde</HI> and lande of Brasill ne∣uer the lesse, as a thinge that they possessed before the con∣sent of this limitation was made.</P>
<P>So none can verylye tell whiche hath the best reason.</P>
<PB REF="20"/>
<P>They bee not yet agreed, <HI>Quare sub Iudice lis est.</HI> But without doubte by all coniectures of reason the sayde Ilandes fall all without the limitation of Portingale, and pertayne to Spaine, as it appeareth by the most parte of all the Cardes made by the Portingales, saue those they haue falsified of late purposely. But nowe touching that your Lordeshippe wrote, whether that which wee discouered tou∣cheth any thing the foresayde coastes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">New found lād discouered by the englishmen.</NOTE> once it appeareth plainely that the Newe founde lande that wee discouered is all a mayne lande with the Indies occidentall, from whence the emperour hath all the golde and pearles: and so continu∣eth of coaste more then <HI>5000.</HI> leagues of length, as by this Carde appeareth. For from the saide newe landes it pro∣ceedeth toward the occidēt to the Indies, and from the In∣dies returneth toward the orient, &amp; after turneth southwarde vp till it come to the straytes of Todos Sanctos, whiche I reckon to bee more then <HI>5000.</HI> leagues.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE>So that to the Indians it shoulde seeme that wee haue some title, at least that for our discouering wee might trade thither as other doe. But all this is nothing neere the spicerie.</P>
<P>Nowe then (if from the sayde newe founde landes the Sea bee Nauigable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To sayle by the pole.</NOTE>) there is no doubte, but sayling Northwarde and passing the pole descending to the equi∣noctiall lyne wee shall hitte these Ilandes, and it shoulde bee muche more shorter way, then eyther the Spaniardes or the Portingales haue. For wee bee distaunt from the pole but <HI>39.</HI> degrees, and from the pole to the Equinoctiall bee <HI>90.</HI> the which added together bee <HI>129.</HI> degrees, leagues <HI>2480.</HI> and myles <HI>7440.</HI> Where wee shoulde finde these Ilandes. And the Nauigation of the Spaniardes to the spicerie is, as by this Carde you may see, from Spayne to the Ilandes of Canarie, and from these Ilandes they runne ouer the lyne Equinoctiall Southwarde to the cape of the mayne lande of Indians, called the Cape of Sainte
<PB REF="20"/> <HI>Augustine,</HI> and from this Cape Southwardes to the straytes of Todos Sanctos,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Or the straite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Magelan.</NOTE> in the whiche Nauigation to the sayde straites is <HI>1700.</HI> or <HI>1800.</HI> leagues: and from these straytes being past them, they returne towarde the line Equinoctiall to the Ilandes of spicerie, whiche are di∣stante from the sayde straites <HI>4200.</HI> or <HI>4300.</HI> leagues.</P>
<P>The Nauigation of the Portingalles to the sayd Ilands is, departing from Portingale Southwarde towarde the <HI>Capo verde,</HI> and from thence to another Cape passing the lyne equinoctiall called <HI>Capo de bona speransa,</HI> and from Portingale to the cape is <HI>1800.</HI> leagues, and from this cape to the Ilandes of spicerie of the Emperour is <HI>2500.</HI> leagues.</P>
<P>So that by this nauigation amounteth all to <HI>4300.</HI> leagues. So that as afore is sayde, if betweene our Newe founde landes or <HI>Norway,</HI> or Islande the Seas towarde the north be Nauigable, wee shoulde goe to these Ilandes a shorter way by more then <HI>2000</HI> leagues. And though wee went not to the saide Ilandes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> for that they are the Emperours or Kinges of Portingale, wee shoulde by the way, and com∣ming once to the line Equinoctiall, finde landes no lesse riche of Golde and spicerie, as all other landes are vnder the saide line Equinoctiall: and also shoulde, if wee may passe vnder the North, enioye the Nauigation of all Tartarie.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Benefite to Englande.</NOTE></P>
<P>Which should bee no lesse profitable to our commodities of clothe, then these spiceries to the Emperour, and king of Portingale.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obiection."/> But it is a generall opinion of all Cosmographers that passing the seuenth clyme, the sea is all ice, the colde so much that none can suffer it. And hitherto they had all the like opi∣nion that vnder the lyne Equinoctiall for muche heate the lande was inhabitable.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answere."/> Yet since by experience is prooued no lande so much habi∣table
<PB REF="21"/> nor more temperate. <MILESTONE UNIT="Answere."/> And to conclude I thinke the same shoulde bee founde vnder the North, if it were expe∣rimented. For as all iudge, <HI>Nihil fit vacuum in rerum natura:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A true opinion.</NOTE> So I iudge there is no lande inhabitable, nor Sea innauigable. If I should write the reason that presenteth this vnto mee, I shoulde bee too prolixe, and it seemeth not requisite for this present matter. God knoweth that though by it I shoulde haue no great interest, yet I haue had and still haue no little minde of this businesse:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A voyage of discouerie by the pole.</NOTE> So that if I had facultie to my will, it shoulde bee y<SUP>e</SUP> first thing that I woulde vnderstande, euen to attempt, if our Seas North∣warde bee nauigable to the Pole, or no. I reason, that as some sicknesses are hereditarious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Thorne and M.

For all is one coaste, as by the carde appeareth, and is aforesaide. Also in this carde by the coastes where you see C. your Lordship shall vnderstand it is set for Cape or head land, where I, for Iland, where P. for Port, where R. for Riuer. Also in al this little carde I thinke nothing be erred touching the situation of the land, saue onely in these Ilands of spicery: which, for that as afore is sayd, euery one setteth them after his minde, there can be no certification how they stand. I doe not denie, that there lacke many things, that a consūmate carde should haue, or that a right good demonstration desireth. For there should be expressed all the mountaines and riuers that are principall of name in the earth, with the names of Portes of the sea, the names of all principall cities, whiche all I might haue set, but not in this Carde, for the little space would not consent.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>Your Lordship may see that setting only the names almost
<PB REF="21"/> of euery region, and yet not of all, the roome is occupied. Many Ilands are also left out for the saide lacke of roome: the names almost of all portes put to silence, with the roses of the windes or pointes of the compasse: For that this is not for Pilots to sayle by, but a summarie declaration of that which your Lordship commaunded. And if by this your Lordshippe cannot well perceiue the meaning of this carde, of the which I woulde not maruell, by reason of the rude composition of it, will it please your Lordship to ad∣uise mee to make a bigger and a better mappe, or els that I may cause one to bee made. For I knowe my selfe in this and all other nothing perfect, but <HI>Licèt semper discens, nun∣quam tamen ad perfectam scientiam peruenient.</HI> Also I knowe to set the forme Sphericall of the worlde in <HI>Plano</HI> after the true rule of Cosmographie, it would haue been made otherwise then this is: Howbeit the demonstration shoulde not haue beene so plaine. And also these degrees of longitude, that I set in the lower part of this Card, shold haue been set along by the line equinoctiall, and so then must bee imagined. For the degrees of longitude neare either of the poles are nothing equal in bignes to them in the equi∣noctiall. But these are set so, for that setting them a long the Equinoctiall, it would haue made obscure a great parte of the mappe. Many other curiosities may be required, which for the nonce I did not set downe, as well for that the intent I had principally was to satisfie your doubt tou∣ching the spicerie, as for that I lacke leysure and time. I trust your Lordshippe correcting that which is erred, will accept my good will, which is to do any thing that I maye in your Lordshippes seruice. But from henceforth I knowe your Lordshippe wil rather commande me to keepe silence, then to be large, when you shalbe weeried with the reading of this discourse. Iesus prosper your estate and health.</P>

<P>ALso this Carde and that which I write touching the vartaunce betweene the Emperour and the king of Portingale, is not to bee shewed or communicated there with many of that Courte. For though there is nothing in it preiudiciall to the Emperour, yet it may bee a cause of paine to the maker: as well for that none may make these Cardes, but certaine appointed and allowed for masters, as for that peraduenture it woulde not sounde well to them, that a stranger shoulde knowe or discouer their secretes: and wolde appeare worst of all, if they vnderstand that I write touching y<SUP>e</SUP> short way to the spicerie by our Seas. Though peraduenture of troth it is not to bee looked too, as a thing that by all opinions is vnpossible, and I thinke neuer will come to effect: and therefore neither heere nor els where is it to bee spoken of. For to moue it amongest wisemen, it shoulde bee had in derision. And therefore to none I woulde haue written nor spoken of such things, but to your Lordship, to whome boldly I commit in this all my foolish fantasie as to my selfe. But if it please God that into Englande I may come with your Lordship, I will shewe some coniectures of reason though against the gene∣rall opinion of Cosmographers, by which shall ap∣peare this that I say not to lacke some foundation. And tyll that time I beseeche your Lordship let it bee put to silence: and in the meane season it may please God to sende our two Englishmen, that are gone to the spicerie, which may also bring more plaine declaration of y<SUP>t</SUP> which in this case might bee desired. Also I knowe it needed not to haue beene so prolixe in the declaration of this Carde to your Lordship, if the saide Carde had beene very well made after the rules of Cosmographie. For your Lordship woulde soone vnder∣stande it better then I, or any other that coulde haue made it: and so it shoulde appeare that I shewed <HI>Delphinum nata∣re.</HI> But for that I haue made it after my rude maner, it is ne∣cessarie that I be the declarer or gloser of mine owne work, or els your Lordship should haue had much labour to vn∣derstande
<PB REF="22"/> it, which nowe with it also cannot bee excused, it is so grossely done. But I knewe you looked for no cu∣rious things of mee, and therefore I trust your Lordshippe will accept this, and holde mee for excused. In other mens letters that they write they craue pardon that at this present they write no larger: but I must finish, asking pardon that at this present I write so largely.

<P>THis exhortation to king Henrie the eight, with the dis∣course to Doctor Ley his Ambassadour in Spaine, was preserued by one master Emmanuel Lucar executour to master Robert Thorne, and was friendly imparted vnto mee by master Cyprian Lucar his sonne an honest Gentle∣man and very forwarde to further any good and landable action. And that it may bee knowne that this motion tooke present effect with the king, I thought it good here∣withall to put downe the testimonie of our Chronicle that the king set out shippes for this discouerie in his life time. master Hall and master Grafton in their Chronicles write both thus: This same moneth king Henry the eight sente two faire ships, well manned and victualed, hauing in them diuers cunning men, to seeke strange regions: and so they set foorth, out of the Thames the xx. day of May in the xix. yeere of his raigne. In the yeere of our Lorde. <HI>1527.</HI></P>

<HEAD>❧ To the most Christian king of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> Fraunces <HI>the first.</HI> The relation of Iohn Verarzanus a Florentine, of the lande by him discouered in the name of his Maie∣stie, written in <HI>Diepe</HI> the eight of Iuly 1524.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Wrote not to your Maiestie (most Chri∣stian king) since the time wee suffered the tempest in the North partes, of the successe of the foure Ships, which your Maiestie sent forth to discouer new lands by the Ocean, thinking your Maiestie had been alreadie duly enformed thereof. Nowe by these presents I will giue your Maiestie to vn∣derstand, howe by the violence of the windes wee were for∣ced with y<SUP>e</SUP> two ships, the <HI>Norman</HI> and the <HI>Dolphin,</HI> in such euill case as they were, to lande in <HI>Britaine.</HI> Whereafter wee had repaired them in all pointes as was needefull and armed them very well, wee tooke our course a long by the coast of <HI>Spaine.</HI> Afterwardes with the <HI>Dolphin</HI> alone, wee determined to make discouerie of newe Countries, to prosecute the nauigation wee had alreadie begun, which I purpose at this present to recount vnto your Maiestie, to make manifest the whole proceeding of the matter. The <HI>17</HI> of Ianuarie, the yeere <HI>1524.</HI> by the grace of God, wee departed from the dishabited Rocke, by the Isle of <HI>Madêra,</HI> appertaining to the king of <HI>Portingall,</HI> with fiftie men, with victuals, weapon, and other ship munition very well pro∣uided and furnished for 8. monethes: And sayling westwards with a faire Easterly winde, in 25. dayes wee ranne 500. leagues, and the 20. of Februarie wee were ouertaken with as sharpe and terrible a tempest as euer any saylers suffe∣red: whereof with y<SUP>e</SUP> diuine helpe &amp; mercifull assistaunce of Almightie God, and the goodnesse of our ship accompanied
<PB REF="24"/> with the good hap of her fortunate name wee were deliue∣red, and with a prosperous wind followed our course West &amp; by North. And in other 25. dayes wee made aboue 400. leagues more, where wee discouered a newe land, neuer be∣fore seene of any man either auncient or moderne, and at the first sight it seemed somewhat lowe, but beeing within a quarter of a league of it, wee perceiued by the great fiers that wee sawe by the Sea coaste that it was inhabited: and saw that the lande stretched to the Southwards: in seeking some conuenient harborough whereby to come a lande, and haue knowledge of the place, wee sayled fiftie leagues in vaine, and seeing the lande to runn still to the Southwards wee resolued to returne backe againe towardes the North, where we found our selues troubled with the like difficulty: at length beeing in despaire to finde any port, wee caste anker vpon the coast, and sent our Boate to shore, where we sawe great store of people which came to the Sea side, and seeing vs to approche they fled away, and sometimes would stande still and looke backe, beholding vs with great admi∣ration: but afterwardes beeing animated and assured with signes that wee made them, some of them came harde to the Sea side seeming to reioyce very muche at the sight of vs, and marueiling greatly at our apparell, shape and whitenes, shewed vs by sundry signes where wee might most commo∣diously come a land with our Boat, offering vs also of their victuals to eate. Nowe I will briefly declare to your Maiestie their life and manners, as farre as wee coulde haue notice thereof: These people goe altogether naked except only that they couer their priuie partes with certaine skinnes of beastes like vnto Marterns, which they fasten vnto a narrowe girdle made of grasse verye artificially wrought, hanged about with tailes of diuers other beastes, which rounde about their bodies hang dangling downe to their knees. Some of them weare garlandes of byrdes feathers. The people are of colour russet, and not much vnlike the Saracens, their hayre blacke, thicke and
<PB REF="24"/> not very long, which they tye togeather in a knot behinde &amp; weare it like a taile. They are wel featured in their limbs, of meane stature and commonly somewhat bigger then we, brode breasted, strong armes, their legges and other partes of their bodies well fashioned, and they are disfigured in no∣thing sauing that they haue somewhat brode visages, and yet not all of them: for wee sawe many of them well fauoured hauing blacke and great eyes, with a cheerefull and stedie looke, not strong of body yet sharpe witted, nymble and great runners, as farre as we coulde learne by experience, and in those two last qualities they are like to the people of the East partes of the worlde, and especially to them of the vttermost partes of <HI>China,</HI> wee coulde not learne of this people their manner of liuing, nor their particuler cu∣stomes by reason of y<SUP>e</SUP> short abode we made on the shore, our companie being but small, and our ship ryding farre of in the Sea. And not farre from these we founde an other peo∣ple, whose liuing wee thinke to bee like vnto theirs, (as heereafter I will declare vnto your Maiestie,) shewing at this present the situation and nature of the foresaide lande: The shore is all couered with small sande, and so ascendeth vpwardes for the space of fifteene foote rising in forme of little hilles about fiftie paces broade. And sayling forwards wee founde certaine small Riuers and armes of the Sea, that enter at certain creekes, washing the shore on both sides as the coast lyeth. And beyonde this wee sawe the open Countrie rising in height aboue the sandie shore with many fayre fieldes and plaines, full of mightie great woods, some verie thicke and some thinne, replenished with diuers sortes of trees, as pleasaunt and delectable to beholde as is possible to imagine. And your Maiestie may not thinke that these are like the woodes of <HI>Hercinia</HI> or the wilde De∣sertes of <HI>Tartary,</HI> and the Northerne Coastes full of fruitelesse trees: But full of Palme trees, Bay trees, and high Cypresse trees, and many other sortes of trees vn∣knowne in <HI>Europe,</HI> which yeeld most sweete sauours farre from the shore, the propertie whereof wee coulde not learne
<PB REF="25"/> For the cause aforesaide, and not for any difficultie to passe through the woods: Seeing they are not so thicke but that a man may passe through them. Neither doe wee thinke that they part taking of the East worlde rounde a∣bout them are all to geather voide of drugs or spicerie, and other richesse of golde, seeing the colour of the lande doth so much argue it and the lande is full of many beastes, as Stags, Deare and Hares, and likewise of Lakes and Pooles of Fresh water, with great plentie of foules, conue∣nient for all kinde of pleasant game. This lande is in la∣titude 34.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gr. 34.</NOTE> D. with good and holsome ayre, temperate, betweene hot and colde, no vehement windes doe blowe in those Regions, and those that doe commonly raigne in those Coastes, are the North West and West windes in the Sommer season, (in the beginning whereof wee were there) the skie cleere and faire with very little raine: and if at any time the ayre bee cloudie and mistie with the Sowtherne winde immediately it is dissolued and waxeth cleare and fayre agayne. The Sea is caulme, not boy∣sterous, the waues gentle, and although all the shore bee somewhat lowe and with out harborough: yet it is not daungerous to the saylers beeing free from rockes and deepe, so that within foure or fiue foote of the shore, there is twentie foote deepe of water without ebbe or flood, the depth still increasing in such vniforme proportion. There is very good ryding at Sea: for any Ship beeing shaken in a tempest can neuer perishe there by breaking of her ca∣bles, which wee haue proued by experience. For in the be∣ginning of March (as is vsuall in all Regions) beeing in the Sea oppressed with Northerne windes and riding there, wee founde our anker broken before the earth fay∣led or mooued at all. Wee departed from this place still running a long the coaste, which we found to trende towarde the East, and wee saw euerie where verie great fi∣ers, by reason of the multitude of the inhabitants. While we rode on that Coaste partlie because it had no harborough, and for that wee wanted water, wee sent our Boat a shore
<PB REF="25"/> with 25. men: whereby reason of great and continual waues that beate against the shore, being an open coast, without succour, none of our men coulde possible goe a shore without loosing our boate. We sawe there many people which came vnto the shore, making diuers signes of friendship, and shew∣ing that they were content wee shoulde come a lande, and by trial we found thē to be very courteous &amp; gentle as your ma∣iestie shal vnderstand by the successe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Courteous and gentle people.</NOTE> To the intent we might sende them of our thinges, which the Indians commonly de∣sier and esteeme as sheetes of Paper, glasses, belles, and such like trifles: Wee sent a young man one of our Marri∣ners a shore, who swimming towards them, and being with∣in 3. or 4. yeards off the shore, not trusting them, cast the thinges vpon the shore, seeking afterwardes to returne, hee was with such violence of the waues beaten vpon the shore, that he was so bruised that hee lay there almost dead, whiche the Indians perceiuing, ranne to catche him, and drawing him out they carried him a little way of from the sea: The young man perceiuing they caried him, beeing at the first dismaide, began then greatly to feare and cried out pitiously, likewise did the Indians which did accompanie him, going about to cheere him and giue him courage, and then setting him on the grounde at the foote of a little hill against the sunne, beganne to beholde him with great admiration, mar∣ueiling at the whitenesse of his fleshe: And putting off his clothes they made him warme at a great fire, not without our great feare which remained in the boate, that they would haue rosted him at that fire and haue eaten him. The young man hauing recouered his strength, and hauing stayed a while with them, shewed them by signes that hee was desi∣rous to returne to the shippe: And they with great loue clap∣ping him fast about with many embracings, accompanying him vnto the sea, and to put him in more assurance, leauing him alone they went vnto a high grounde and stoode there, beholding him vntil he was entred into the boate. This yong man obserued as we did also, that these are of colour encli∣ning to Blacke as the other were, with their fleshe ve∣rie
<PB REF="26"/> shining of meane stature, handsome visag, and dilicate limmes and of verie little strength: but of prompt witte, far∣ther wee obserued not.</P>
<P>Departing from hence following the shore which tren∣ded somewhat towarde the North in 50. leagues space, wee came to another lande which shewed much more faire and full of woods, being very great, where we rode at Ancker, and that wee might haue some knowledge thereof, wee sent 20. men a lande, which entred into the countrey about two leagues, and they founde that the people were fledde to the woods for feare, they sawe onely one olde woman with a young maide of 18. or 20. yeeres olde, which seeing our com∣panie hid them selues in the grasse for feare, the olde woman caried two Infantes on her shoulders, and behinde her necke a childe of 8. yeeres olde: the yong woman was laden like∣wise with as many: but when our men came vnto them, the women cryed out, the olde woman made signes that the men were fled vnto the woods, as soone as they sawe vs to quiet them and to winne their fauour, our men gaue them suche victuals as they had with them to eate, which the old woman receiued thankfully: but the yong woman disdained them al, and threwe them disdainefully on the grounde, they tooke a childe from the olde woman to bring into Fraunce, and go∣ing about to take the young woman which was verye beaw∣tifull &amp; of tal stature, they could not possibly for y<SUP>e</SUP> great out∣cries that shee made bring her to the sea, and especially ha∣uing great woods to passe through, and being farre from the shippe, wee purposed to leaue her behinde bearing away the childe onely. We found those folkes to bee more white than those that we founde before, being clad with certaine leaues y<SUP>e</SUP> hang on boughes of trees, which they sowe together with thredes of wilde hempe, their heads were trussed vp after the same manner as the former were, their ordinarie foode is of pulse, whereof they haue great store, differing in colour &amp; taste frō ours, of good &amp; plasant taste. Moreouer they liue by fishing &amp; fouling which they take with ginnes, and bowes made of hard wood the arrowes of Canes, being
<PB REF="26"/> headed with the bones of fishe and other beastes. The beastes in these parts are much wilder thē in our <HI>Europe,</HI> by reason they are continually chased and hunted. Wee sawe many of their boates made of one tree 20. foote long, and 4. foote broade, which are not made with Iron, or stone, or any other kinde of metal, (because that in all this countrie for the space of 200. leagues whiche we ranne, wee neuer sawe one stone of any sort): they help themselues with fyre, burning so much of the tree as is sufficient for the hollownesse of the boate, the like they doe in making the sterne and the foreparte vntill it be fitte to saile vpon the sea. The lande is in situation, good∣nesse and fairenes like the other: it hath woods like the other, thinne and full of diuers sortes of trees: but not so sweete be∣cause the countrey is more northerly and cold.</P>
<P>Wee sawe in this Countrey many Vines growing na∣turally, which growing vp take hold of the trees as they do in Lombardie, w<SUP>c</SUP> if by husbandmen they were dressed in good order, without all doubte they woulde yeelde excellent wines: for wee hauing oftentymes seene the fruite there∣of dried, whiche was sweete and pleasaunt, and not diffe∣ring from ours. Wee doe thinke that they doe esteeme the same, because that in euery place where they growe, they take away the vnder braunches growing rounde about, that the fruite thereof may ripen the better.</P>
<P>We found also roses, violettes, lillies, and many sorts of herbes, and sweete and odoriferous flowers different from ours. We knewe not their dwellinges, because they were farre vp in the lande, and wee iudge by manye signes that wee sawe, that they are of wood and of trees framed toge∣ther.</P>
<P>Wee doe beleeue also by many coniectures and signes, that many of them sleeping in the fieldes, haue no other co∣uer then the open skye. Further knowledge haue wee not of them, we thinke y<SUP>t</SUP> all the rest whose countreys we passed liue all after one manner, hauing our aboade three dayes in this cuntrey, riding on the coast for want of harboroughs, we
<PB REF="27"/> concluded to departe from thence, trending along the shore betweene the North and the East, sayling onely in the day∣time, &amp; riding at ancker by night in the space of 100. leagues sayling, wee founde a very pleasant place, situated amongst certaine litle steepe hilles: from amiddest the which hilles there ran down into the sea a great streame of water, which within the mouth was very deep, &amp; from y<SUP>e</SUP> sea to y<SUP>e</SUP> mouth of same with the tyde which wee found to rise 8. foot, any great vessell laden may passe vp.</P>
<P>But because wee rode at Ancker in a place well fensed from the winde, wee woulde not venture our selues without knowledge of the place, and wee passed vp with our boate onely into the sayde Riuer, and sawe the Countrey very wel peopled. The people are almost like vnto the others, and clad with the fethers of foules of diuers colours, they came to∣wardes vs very cherefully, making great showtes of admi∣ration, shewing vs where we might come to lande most safe∣ly with our boate. We entred vp the said riuer into the lande about halfe a league, where it made a most pleasant lake a∣bout 3. leagues in compasse: on the which they rowed from the one side to the other to the number of 30. of their small boates: wherein were many people whiche passed from one shore to the other to come and see vs, and beholde vpon the sodaine (as it is wont to fall out in sayling) a contrarie flawe of winde comming from the sea, wee were enforced to re∣turne to our Shippe, leauing this lande to our great dis∣contentment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pleasant∣nes and riches of the lande.</NOTE> for the great commoditie and pleasantnesse thereof whiche wee suppose is not without some ri∣ches, all the hills shewing minerall matters in thē. We wei∣ed Ancker, and sayled towarde the East, for so the coast tren∣ded, and so alwayes for 50. leagues being in the sight there∣of wee discouered and Ilande in forme of a triangle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The descriptiō of Claudia I∣lande.</NOTE> dis∣tant from the maine lande 3. leagues, about the bignesse of the Ilande of the <HI>Rodes,</HI> it was full of hilles couered with trees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Claudia was wife of King Francis.</NOTE> well peopled, for we sawe fires all along the coaste, wee gaue the name of it, of your Maiesties mother, not stay∣ing there by reason of the weather being contrarie.</P>
<PB REF="27"/>
<P>And wee came to another lande being 15. leagues distant from the Ilande, where wee founde a passing good hauen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Countrey of Sir H. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. voyage.</NOTE> wherein being entred we founde about 20. small boates of the people which with diuers cries and wondrings came a∣bout our shippe, comming no nerer then 50. paces towards vs, they stayed and behelde the artificialnesse of our ship, our shape &amp; apparel, thā they al made a loud showte together de∣claring that they reioyced: when we had something anima∣ted them vsing their geastes, they came so neere vs that wee cast them certaine bells and glasses and many toyes, whiche when they had receiued they lookte on them with laughing &amp; came without feare aborde our ship. There were amongst these people 2. kings of so goodly stature and shape as is pos∣sible to declare, the eldest was about 40. yeeres of ag, the se∣cond was a yong man of 20. yeres old. Their apparell was on this maner, the elder had vpō his naked body a harts skin wrought artificialie with diuers braunches like Damaske, his head was bare with the haire tyed vp behinde with diuers knottes: About his necke he had a large chaine, garnished with diuers stones of sundrie colours the young man was almost appareled after the same manner. This is the good∣liest people and of the fairest conditions that wee haue found in this our voyage. They exceed vs in bignes, they are of the colour of brasse, some of thē encline more to whitnes: others are of yellowe colour, of comely visage with long &amp; blacke heire which they are very carefull to trim and decke vp, they are blacke and quicke eyed. I write not to your Maiestie, of the other parte of their bodie, hauing all suche proportion as appertayneth to anye handsome man. The women are of the like conformitie and Beawtie, verie handsome and well fauoured, they are as well mannered and conti∣nente as anye women, of good education, they are all naked saue their priuie partes whiche they couer with a Deares skinne braunched or embrodered as the men vse: there are also of them whiche weare on their armes verie riche skinnes of leopardes, they adorne their heades with diuers ornamentes made of their owne heire, whiche hange
<PB REF="28"/> downe before on both sides their brestes, others vse other kinde of dressing them selues like vnto the women of <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Syria,</HI> these are of the elder sorte: and when they are married they weare diuers toyes, according to the vsage of the people of the East as well men as women.</P>
<P>Among whom wee sawe many plates of wrought coper, which they esteeme more then golde, whiche for the colour they make no accompt of, for that among all other it is counted the basest, they make most accompt of <HI>Azure</HI> and <HI>red.</HI> The things that they esteemed most of al those which we gaue them were bels, cristall of Azure colour, and other toies to hang at their eares or about their necke. They did not de∣sire cloth of silke or of golde, muche lesse of any other sorte, neither cared they for thinges made of steele and Iron, which wee often shewed them in our armour whiche they made no wonder at, and in beholding them they onely asked the arte of making them: the like they did at our glasses, which whē the behelde, they sodainely laught and gaue them vs againe. They are very liberal for they giue that which they haue, we became great friendes with these, and one day wee entred in∣to the hauen with our shippe, where as before wee rode a league of at sea by reason of the contrary weather. They came in great companies of their small boates vnto the ship with their faces all be painted with diuers colours, shewing vs y<SUP>t</SUP> it was a signe of ioy, bringing vs of their victuals, they made signes vnto vs where wee might safest ride in the ha∣uen for the safegarde of our shippe keeping still our compa∣nie: and after we were come to an Ancker, we bestowed fif∣teene dayes in prouiding our selues many necessary things, whether euery day the people repayred to see our ship bring∣ing their wiues with them, whereof they are very ielous: and they themselues entring abrode the shippe and stayinge there a good space, caused their wiues to stay in their boates, and for al the intreatie we could make, offering to giue them diuers things, we could neuer obtaine that they would suffer them to come aborde our ship. And oftentimes one of the two kings comming with his queene, and many gentlemen for their pleasure to see vs, they all stayed on y<SUP>e</SUP> shore two hun∣dred
<PB REF="28"/> paces frō vs, sending a smal boate to giue vs intelligēce of their comming, saying they would come to see our shippe, this they did in token of safetye, and assoone as they had an∣swere from vs they came immediatly, and hauing stayed a while to beholde it, they wondered at hearing the cryes and noyes of the marriners. The queene and her maids stayed in a very light boate, at an Iland a quarter of a leage off, while the king abode a long space in our ship vttering diuers con∣ceites with geastures, viewing with great admiration, all the furniture of the shippe, demaunding the propertie of euerie thing perticularly. He tooke likewise great pleasure in beholding our apparell, and in tasting our meates, and so courteously taking his leaue departed. And sometimes our men staying for two or three dayes on a litle Ilande nere the ship for diuers necessaries, (as it is y<SUP>e</SUP> vse of seamen) he retur∣ned with 7. or 8. of his gentlemen to see what we did, and as∣ked of vs oft times if wee meant to make any long aboade there, offering vs of their prouision: then the king drawing his bowe and running vp and downe with his gentlemen, made much sporte to gratifie our men, wee were oftentimes within the lande 5. or 6. leagues, which we found as pleasant as is possible to declare very apt for any kinde of husbandry of corne, wine and oyle: for that there are plaines 25. or 30. leagues broad, open and without any impediment of trees of such fruitfulnesse, that any seede being sowne therein, will bring forth most excellent fruite. We entred afterwards in∣to the woods which wee found so great and thicke, that any armie were it neuer so great might haue hid it selfe therein, the trees whereof are okes, cipres trees, and other sortes vn∣knowen in <HI>Europe.</HI> We found Pomi appii, Damson trees, and Nutte trees, and many other sorts of fruits differing frō ours: there are beasts in great abundance, as hartes, deares, leopardes, and other kinds which they take with their nets &amp; bowes which are their chiefe weapons, the arrowes whiche they vse are made with great cunning, and in steade of iron, they head them with smeriglio, w<SUP>t</SUP> iasper stone, &amp; hard mar∣ble &amp; other sharp stones which they vse in stead of iron to cut
<PB REF="29"/> trees, and make their boates of one whole piece of wood, ma∣king it hollowe with great and wonderfull art, wherein 10. or 12. men may bee cōmodiously, their oares are shorte and broad at the ende, and they vse them in the sea without anye daunger, and by maine force of armes, with as great speedi∣nesse as they liste them selues. We sawe their houses made in circuler or rounde fourme 10. or 12. foote in compasse, made with halfe circles of timber, seperate one from ano∣ther without any order of building, couered with mattes of strawe wrought cunningly together, which saue them from the winde and raine, and if they had the order of building and perfect skil of workmāship as we haue: there were no doubt but y<SUP>t</SUP> they would also make eftsoones great and stately buil∣dings. For all the sea coastes are full of cleare and glistering stones, and alablaster, and therefore it is full of good hauens and barbarours for ships. They mooue the foresaide houses from one place to another according to the commoditie of the place and season wherein they will make their aboade, and only taking of the couer, they haue other houses builded incontinent. The father and the whole familie dwell toge∣ther in one house in great number: in some of them we sawe 25. or 30. persons. They feede as the other doe aforesaide of pulse whiche doe growe in that countrey with better order of husbandry thē in the others. They obserue in their sowing the course of the Moone and the rising of certaine starres, and diuers other customes spoken of by antiquitie. Moreo∣uer, they liue by hunting and fishing. they liue long, and are seldome sicke, and if they chaunce to fall sicke at any time, they heale them selues with fire without any phisition, and they say that they die for very age. They are very pitiful and charitable towardes their neighbours, they make great la∣mentations in their aduersitie &amp; in their miserie, the kinred recken vp all their felicitie, at their departure out of life, they vse mourning mixt w<SUP>t</SUP> singing, w<SUP>t</SUP> continueth for a lōg space. This is asmuch as wee coulde learne of them. This lande is situated in the Paralele of <HI>Rome,</HI> in 41. degrees &amp; 2. terces:
<PB REF="29"/> but somewhat more colde by accidentall cause and not of nature, (as I will declare vnto your highnesse els where) describing at this present the situation of the foresaide coun∣trie, which lyeth East and West, I say that the mouth of the hauen lyeth open to the South halfe a league broade, and being entred within it betweene the East and the North, it stretcheth twelue leagues: where it waxeth broder and bro∣der, and maketh a gulfe aboute 20. leagues in compasse, wherein are fine small Islandes very fruitfull and pleasant, full of hie and broade trees, among the which Ilandes, any great Nauie may ryde safe without any feare of tempest or other daunger. Afterwardes turning towards the South and in the entring into the Hauen on both sides there are most pleasant hilles, with many riuers of most cleere water falling into the Sea.</P>
<P>In the middest of this entraunce there is a rock of free stone growing by nature apt to builde any Castle or For∣tresse there, for y<SUP>e</SUP> keeping of the hauen. The fift of May be∣ing furnished with all thinges necessarie, we departed from y<SUP>e</SUP> said Coast keeping along in the sight thereof, &amp; we sayled 150 leagues finding it all wayes after one manner: but the lande somewhat higher with certaine mountaines all which beare a shewe of minerall matter, wee sought not to lande there in any place, because the weather serued our turne for sayling: but wee suppose that it was like to the former, the Coast ranne Eastward for the space of fiftie leagues. And trending afterwardes the North, wee founde another lande high full of thicke woods, the trees whereof were firres, Ci∣presses and such like as are wont to growe in colde Coun∣tries. The people differ much from the other, &amp; looke how much the former seemed to be courteous and gentle: so much were these full of rudenesse and ill manners, and so barba∣rous that by no signes that euer wee coulde make, wee could haue any kinde of trafficke with them. They cloth thēselues with Beares skinnes and Leopardes and sealles and other beastes skinnes. Their foode as farre as wee coulde per∣cieue,
<PB REF="30"/> repayring often vnto their dwellings wee suppose to bee by hunting and fishing, and of certaine fruites, which are a kinde of rootes, which the earth yeeldeth of her owne ac∣cord. They haue no graine, neither sawe wee any kinde or signe of tyllage, neither is the lande, for the barrennes ther∣of apt to beare frute or seed. If at any time we desired by ex∣chaunge to haue any of their commodities, they vsed to come to the Sea shore vpon certaine craggie rocks, and wee stan∣ding in our Boats, they let downe with a rope what it plea∣sed them to giue vs, crying continually that wee should not approch to the lande, demanding immediately the exchange taking nothing but kniues, fishookes and tooles to cut with∣all, neither did they make any account of our curtesie. And when we had nothing left to exchange with them, when we departed from them the people shewed all signes of discour∣tesie and disdaine, as was possible for any creature to inuent. Wee were in despight of them two or three leagues within the lande, being in number 25. armed men of vs: And when wee went on shore they shot at vs with their bowes, making great outcries, and afterwardes fled into the woods. Wee founde not in this lande any thing notable, or of importance, sauing very great woods and certaine hilles, they may haue some mynerall matter in them, because wee sawe many of thē haue beadstones of Copper hanging at their eares. We departed from thence keeping our course North East along the coaste, which wee founde more pleasant champion and without woods, with high mountaines within the lande continuing directly along the coast for the space of fiftie leagues, wee discouered 32. Ilelandes lying all neare the lande, being small and pleasant to the viewe, high and ha∣uing many turnings and windings betwene them, making many fayre harboroughes and chanels as they doe in the goulfe of <HI>Venice</HI> in <HI>Saluonia,</HI> and <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> wee had no knowledge or acquaintance with the people: wee suppose they are of the same maners and nature that the others are. Sayling Northeast for the space of 150. leagues we appro∣ched
<PB REF="30"/> to the lande that in times past was discouered by the <HI>Britons,</HI> which is in fiftie degrees. Hauing now spent all our prouision and victuals, and hauing discouered about 700. leagues and more of newe Countries, and being furnished with Water and Wood wee concluded to returne into <HI>Fraunce.</HI></P>
<P>Touching the religion of this people, which wee haue founde for want of their language we could not vnderstand neither by signes nor gesture that they had any religion or lawe at all, or that they did acknowledge any first cause or mouer, neither that they worship the heauen or starres the Sunne or Moone or other Planets, and much lesse whe∣ther they bee idolaters, neither coulde wee learne whether that they vsed any kinde of Sacrifices or other adorations, neither in their villages haue they any Temples or houses of prayer. We suppose that they haue no religion at all, and y<SUP>t</SUP> they liue at their owne libertie. And y<SUP>t</SUP> all this procee∣deth of ignorance, for that they are very easie to bee persua∣ded: and all that they see vs Christians doe in our diuine ser∣uice they did the same with the like imitation as they sawe vs to doe it.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the yere of our Lord <HI>1200.</HI> There was in the Citie of <HI>Ve∣nice</HI> a famous Gentleman, na∣med <HI>M. Marino Zeno,</HI> who for his great vertue and singular wisedome, was called and elec∣ted gouernour in certain com∣mon wealthes of <HI>Italy,</HI> in the administration whereof hee bore himselfe so discreetly, that hee was beloued of all men, and his name greatly reueren∣ced of those that neuer knewe or sawe his person. And a∣mong sundrie his worthie workes, this is recorded of him, that hee pacified certaine greeuous ciuile dissentions that arose among the Cittzens of <HI>Verona:</HI> whereas otherwise if by his graue aduise and great diligence, they had not beene preuented, the matter was likely to breake out in hot broiles of warre.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Podesta.</NOTE> Hee was the first <HI>Agent</HI> that the common wealth of <HI>Venice</HI> kept in <HI>Constantinople</HI> in the yeere <HI>1205. <HI>quan∣do n'era patrona, conli baroni frācesi.</HI></HI> This Gentleman had a sonne named <HI>M. Pietro,</HI> who was the father of the Duke <HI>Rinieri,</HI> which Duke dying with out issue, made his heyre <HI>M. Andrea,</HI> the sonne af <HI>M. Marco</HI> his brother. This <HI>M. Andrea</HI> was captaine generall and Procurator, a man of great reputation for many rare partes, that were in him. He had a sonne <HI>M. Rinieri,</HI> a worthie Senatour and pru∣dent Councellour: Of whom descende <HI>M. Pietro</HI> Gene∣rall of the league of the Christians against the Turkes, who was called <HI>Dragon,</HI> for that in his armes hee bare a Dragon. Hee was father to <HI>M. Carlo</HI> the famous Procurator and Generall againste the <HI>Genowayes</HI> in
<PB REF="31"/> those cruel warres, when as almost all the chiefe princes of <HI>Europe</HI> did oppugne and seek to ouerthrow our Empire and libertie, where by his great valiancie and prowesse like an other <HI>Furius Camillus,</HI> he deliuered his Countrie from the present perill it was in, being readie to become a pray &amp; spoyle vnto the enemie, wherefore hee was afterwarde sur∣named, the Lion, and for an eternall remembrance of his for∣titude and valiant exploits he gaue the Lion in his armes. <HI>M. Carlo</HI> had two brethren, <HI>M. Nicolo,</HI> the knight &amp; <HI>Anto∣nio,</HI> the father <HI>M. Dragon,</HI> of whom issued <HI>M. Caterino,</HI> the father of <HI>M. Pietro,</HI> this <HI>M.

Nicolo,</HI> that is yet liuing. Now <HI>M. Nicolo,</HI> the knight, being a man of great courage and very nobly minded, after this foresaide warre of <HI>Genoua,</HI> that troubled so our prede∣cessours, entred into a wonderfull great desire and fansie to see the fashions of the world, and to trauaile, and to acquaint himselfe with the manners of sundry nations &amp; learne their languages, wherby afterwards vpō occasions hee might be y<SUP>e</SUP> better able to do seruice to his coūtrie &amp; purchase to him∣selfe credite &amp; honor. Wherfore hee caused a shippe to bee made &amp; hauing furnished her at his proper charges (as hee was very wealthie) hee departed out of our Seas &amp; passing the straites of <HI>Gibralterra,</HI> he sailed for certaine dayes vpon y<SUP>e</SUP> Ocean keeping his course stil to y<SUP>e</SUP> Northwards, w<SUP>t</SUP> intent to see <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Flaunders.</HI> Where being assaulted in those Seas by a terrible tempest, was so tossed for the space of many dayes with the Sea and winde that hee knewe not where hee was, till at length hee discouered lande, and not beeing able any longer to sustaine the violence of the tem∣pest the ship was cast away vpon the Isle of <HI>Friseland.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ship of M. N. Zeno cast a∣way vpon Fris∣land in anno. 1380.</NOTE> The men were saued, and most part of the goods that were in the Ship. And this was in the yeere <HI>1380.</HI> The inhabitants of the Iland came running in great multitudes w<SUP>t</SUP> weapons to set vpon <HI>M. Nicolo</HI> and his men, who beeing sore wether beaten and ouerlaboured at Sea, and not knowing in what
<PB REF="32"/> part of the worlde they were, were not able to make any re∣sistaunce at all, much lesse to defende them selues couragi∣ously, as it behooued them in such dangerous case. And they shoulde haue beene doubtlesse very discourteously en∣treated and cruelly handeled, if by good hap there had not been hard by the place a Prince with armed people. Who vnderstanding, that there was euen at that present a great ship cast away vpon the Iland, came running at the noyse and outcries that they made against our poore Mariners, and driuing away the inhabitants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A forraine prince hapning to be in Frislād w<SUP>t</SUP> armed men. When M. Zeno suffered ship∣wrack, there came vnto him and spake latin.</NOTE> spake in latine and asked them what they were and from whence they came, and per∣ceiuing y<SUP>t</SUP> they were Italians, &amp; all of one Countrie, he was surprised with marueilous great ioy. Wherefore promi∣sing thē all, that they shoulde receiue no discourtesie, and that they were come into a place where they shoulde bee well v∣sed and very welcome, he tooke them into his protection vp∣on his faith. This was a great Lord and possessed certaine Ilands called <HI>Porland,</HI> lying one the Southside of <HI>Frisland</HI> being y<SUP>e</SUP> richest and most populous of all those partes, his name was <HI>Zichmni:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zichmni prince of Porland or duke of Zorani.</NOTE> &amp; beside the said little Ilands, he was Duke of <HI>Sorani,</HI> lying within the land towards <HI>Scotland.</HI> Of these North partes I thought good to draw the copie of a Sea carde, which amongest other antiquities, I haue in my house, which although it be rotten through many yeres: yet it falleth out indifferent well, and to those that are de∣lighted in these things, it may serue for some light to the vn∣derstanding of that, which without it cannot so easily be con∣ceiued. <HI>Zichmni</HI> being Lorde of those Seignories (as is said) was a very warlike and valiant man &amp; aboue al things famous in Sea causes. And hauing this yeere before gi∣uen the ouerthrowe to the king of <HI>Norway,</HI> who was Lord of the Ilande,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Frisland the king of Nor∣wayes.</NOTE> beeing desirous to winne fame by feates of armes, was come on land with his mē to giue the attēpt, for y<SUP>e</SUP> winning of <HI>Frisland,</HI> which is an Iland much bigger then Ireland. Wherefore seeing that <HI>M. Nicolo</HI> was a mā of iudgement and discretion, and very expert both in Sea mat∣ters and martiall affaires, hee gaue him commission to goe aboord his nauie with all his men, charging the captaine to
<PB REF="32"/> honour him and in all things to vse his counsaile. This Nauie of <HI>Zichmni</HI> was of thirteene vessels, wherof two on∣ly were with oares, the rest small barkes, and one ship, with the which they sayled to the Westwardes and with little paines wonne <HI>Ledouo</HI> and <HI>Ilofe</HI> and diuers other small I∣landes, and turning into a bay called <HI>Sudero,</HI> in the hauen of the towne named <HI>Sanestol</HI> they tooke certaine small Barks laden with salt fish. And heere they founde <HI>Zichmni,</HI> who came by land with his armie conquering all the countrie as he went, they staied here but a while but held on their course to the Westwards till they came to the other Cape of the goulfe or bay, then turning againe they found certaine Ile∣landes and broken landes which they reduced all vnto the Seignorie and possession of <HI>Zichmni.</HI> These Seas for as much as they sayled, were in maner nothing but sholds and rocks, in sort that if <HI>M. Nicolo</HI> and the <HI>venetian</HI> mariners had not beene their Pilots, the whole Fleete in iudgement of all that were in it, had been cast away, so small was y<SUP>e</SUP> skill of <HI>Zichmnis</HI> men in respect of ours, who had been trained vp in the art and practise of nauigation all the daies of their life. Now the Fleete hauing doone such things, (as is decla∣red) y<SUP>e</SUP> Captaine by the counsel of <HI>M. Nicolo,</HI> determined to goe a lande at a towne called <HI>Bondendon,</HI> to vnderstande what successe <HI>Zichmni</HI> had in his warres, where they heard to their great content, that he had fought a great battaile and put to flight the armie of his enemie: by reason of which vic∣torie they sent Embassadours from all partes of the Ilande to yeeld the countrie vp into his handes, taking down their enseignes in euery towne and castell: They thought good to stay in that place for his comming, being reported for cer∣taine that the would bee there very shortly. At his comming there was great congratulatiō and many signes of gladnes shewed, as wel for the victorie by lande as for that by Sea, for the which the <HI>venetians</HI> were honoured &amp; extolled of all men, in such sort y<SUP>t</SUP> there was no talke but of them, and of y<SUP>e</SUP> great valour of <HI>M. Nicolo.</HI> Wherfore the Prince who was a great fauourer of valiant men and especially of those that
<PB REF="33"/> could behaue them selues well at the Sea, caused <HI>M. Nico∣lo</HI> to bee brought before him, and after hauing commended him with many honourable speeches, and praysed his great industrie and dexterie of wit, by the which, he acknowledged himselfe to haue receiued an inestimable benefite as the sa∣uing of his Fleete and the winning of many places, he made him Knight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">N. Zeno, made knight by Zichmni.</NOTE> and rewarded his men with many riche and bountifull giftes: Then departing from thence they went in triumphing maner towardes <HI>Friseland,</HI> the chief Citie of y<SUP>e</SUP> Ilande,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ships laden with fish at fris∣land: for Flaun∣ders, Britaine.

In this goulfe or bay there is such great abundance of fish taken, that many ships are laden therewith to serue <HI>Flaunders, Britaine, Eng∣land, Scotland, Norway</HI> and <HI>Denmarke,</HI> and by this trade they gather great wealth.</P>
<P>And thus much is taken out of a letter, that <HI>M. Nicolo</HI> sent vnto <HI>M. Antonio</HI> his brother, requesting him that hee woulde seeke some meanes to come to him. Wherefore hee, who had as great desire to trauaile as his brother, bought a Ship, and directing his course that way, after hee had sayled a great while and escaped many dangers, hee ar∣riued at length in safetie with <HI>M. Nicolo,</HI> who receiued him very ioyfully, for that hee was his brother not only in fleshe and blood, but also in valour and good qualities. <HI>M. An∣tonio</HI> remained in <HI>Friselande</HI> and dwelt there for the space of fourteene yeeres, foure yeeres with <HI>M. Nicolo,</HI> and ten yeeres alone. Where they came into such grace and fa∣uour with the Prince, that hee made <HI>M. Nicolo,</HI> Captaine of his Nauie, &amp; with great preparation of warre they were sent foorth for the enterprise of <HI>Estlande,</HI> which lyeth vpon the coaste betweene <HI>Friseland</HI> and <HI>Norway,</HI> where they did many dōmages, but hearing that the king of <HI>Norway</HI> was comming towardes them with a great Fleet, they departed w<SUP>t</SUP> such a terrible flaw of wind y<SUP>t</SUP> they were driuē vpō certain sholdes. Where a great part of their ships were cast away, y<SUP>e</SUP> rest were saued vpō <HI>Grisland,</HI> a great Iland but dishabited.
<PB REF="33"/> The king of <HI>Norway</HI> his fleete being taken with the same storme, did vtterly perishe in those seas. Whereof <HI>Zichmni</HI> hauing notice, by a shippe of his enemies, that was cast by chaunce vpon <HI>Grisland.</HI> Hauing repayred his fleete, and perceyuing him selfe northerly neere vnto the Islandes, de∣termined to set vpon Islande, which together with the rest was subiect to the king of <HI>Norway:</HI> But he founde the coun∣trey so well fortified and defended, that his fleete beeing so small and very ill appointed both of weapons and men, hee was gladde to retire. And so hee left that enterprise with∣out perfourming any thing at all, and in the same chanelles he assaulted y<SUP>e</SUP> other Iles called the Islands, which are seuen <HI>Talas, Broas, Iscant, Trans, Mimant, Dambere, &amp; Bres,</HI> and hauing spoyled them all, hee built a fort in <HI>Bres,</HI> where he left <HI>M.

<P>There is a fountayne of hot burning water with the whiche they heate the Churche of the monasterie and the Fryers chambers, it commeth also into the kitchen so boyling hotte, that they vse no other fire to dresse their meate, and putting their bread into brasse pottes without any water, it doeth bake as it were in a hot ouen. They haue also small gar∣dens, couered ouer in the winter time, which being watered with this water are defended from the force of the snowe and colde, which in those parts being situate farre vnder the pole, is very extreeme;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A notable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> and by this meanes they produce flo∣wers and fruites and herbes of sundrie sortes, euen as in o∣ther temperate countreys in their seasons in suche sorte that the rude and sauage people of those partes seeing these su∣pernaturall
<PB REF="34"/> effectes doe take those Friers for Gods, and bring them many presentes as chickens, fleshe and diuers o∣ther thinges, and haue them all in great reuerence as Lords. When the frost and snowe is great, they heate their houses in maner before said, and will by letting in the water or ope∣ning the windowes, temper the heate and colde at their plea∣sure. In y<SUP>e</SUP> buildings of the monastery they vse no other mat∣ter but that which is ministred vnto them by the fire, for they take the burning stones, that are cast out as it were sparkles or ceindres at the firie mouth of the hill, and when they are most enflamed, cast water vpon them, wherby they are dissol∣ued and become excellēt white lime and so tough that being contriued in building it lasteth for euer. And the very spar∣kles after the fire is out of them do serue in steede of stones to make walles and vautes: for being once colde they will ne∣uer dissolue or breake except they be cut with some irō toole, and the vautes that are made of them are so light that they need no sustentacle or proppe to holde them vp, and they wil endure continually very fayre and whole. By reason of these great commodities the friers haue made there so many buil∣dings and walles, that it is a wonder to see. The couerts or roofes of their houses for the most part are made in this ma∣ner, first they rayse the wall vp to his full height, then they make it enclining or bowing in by litle and litle in forme of a vaute. But they are not greatly troubled with raine in those partes, for that, by reason of the pole or colde climate, the first snowe being falne it thaweth no more for the space of nine moneths, for so long dureth their winter. They feede of the fleshe of wilde beastes &amp; of fish, for where as the warme water falleth into the sea, there is a large and wide hauen, which by reason of the heate of the water, doeth neuer freeze all the winter, by meanes whereof there is suche concourse and flocks of sea foule and such aboundance of fishe, that they take thereof infinite multitudes, whereby they maintayne a great number of people rounde about whiche they keepe in continuale worke, both in building and taking of foules and fishe, and in a thousande other necessarie affaires and busines
<PB REF="34"/> about the monasterie.</P>
<P>Their houses are builte about the hill on euery side, in fourme rounde, and <HI>25.</HI> foote broade, and in mounting vp∣wardes they goe narower and narower, leauing at the toppe a litle hole, whereat the ayre commeth in, to giue light to the house, and the flore of the house is so hot, that being with∣in they feele no colde at all.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trade in som∣mer time from Trondon to S.

There are continually in that part many barkes, whiche are kept in there by reason of the sea being frozen, wayting for the season of the yeere to dissolue the Ice. The fishers boates are made like vnto a we∣uers shuttle, taking the skins of fishes, they fashiō them with the bones of the same fishes, and sowing thē together in ma∣ny doubles they make them so sure and substanciall, that it is miraculous to see, how in tempests they will shut thēselues close within, and let the sea and winde carrie them, they care not whether, without any feare eyther of breaking or drow∣ning.

To these things our Prince answered nothing at all, but causing his men to seeke some good harborough, hee made signes as though he would come on land, and sayling round about the Iland, hee espied at length a harborough on the East side of the Ilande, where he put in with all his Fleet, the mariners went on land to take in wood and water, which they did with as great speede as they coulde, doubting least they shoulde be assaulted by the inhabitants as it fell out in deed, for those that dwelt there abouts, making signes vnto the other with fire and smoke, put them selues presently in armes and the other comming to them, they came al running downe to the Sea side vpon our men, with bowes and arrowes and other weapons, that many were slaine and diuers sore wounded. And we made signes of peace vnto them, but it was to no purpose, for their rage encreased more and more, as though they had fought for life and liuing. Wherefore wee were forced to depart and to sayle along in a great circuite about the Iland, being alwaies accompanied vpon the hil tops and the Sea coast with an infinite multitude of armed men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Infinite multi∣tude of armed men in Icaria.</NOTE> and so doubling the Cape of the Iland towardes the North, wee found many great sholdes amongst the which for the space of ten daies we were in continual danger of loosing our whole Fleete, but that it pleased God all that while to send vs very faire weather.

So therefore it see∣meth that it hath pleased God by his godly prouidence to
<PB REF="41"/> reserue the care which hee hath had of their saluation vntill this time, and will bring them to our faith, at the time by himselfe alone foreseene and ordeined. For if it were need∣full to shewe howe many from time to time haue gone about to finde out this great lande, and to inhabite there: who ne∣uerthelesse haue alwaies failed &amp; beene put by from their in∣tention and purpose: some by feare of shipwrackes, and some by great windes and tempestes that droue them backe to their merueilous griefe. Of the which there was one a very famous stranger named Sebastian Gabota<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sebastian Gabota.</NOTE> an excel∣lent Pylot sent thither by king Henry, the yeere 1498. and many others, who neuer could attaine to any habitation nor take possession thereof one only foote of grounde, nor yet ap∣proche or enter into these parties and faire riuers into the which God hath brought vs. Wherefore (my Lorde) it may bee well saide that the liuing God hath reserued this great lande for your poore seruantes and subiectes, as well to the ende they might bee made great ouer this poore people, &amp; rude nation: as also to approue the former affection which our kings haue had vnto this discouerie.</P>

But they being not able to bring to passe at this first voyage that which he had inten∣ded, nor to arriue in any Port, by reason of sundrie incōueni∣ences (which cōmōly happē) were cōstrained to return into Fraunce: where after his arriuall, he neuer ceassed to make
<PB REF="41"/> suite vntill he was sent thither againe, where at last he died. The which occasion gaue small courage to sende thither a∣gayne, and was the cause that this laudable enterprise was left of, vntill the yeere 1534. at which time his Maiestie, (de∣siring alwayes to enlarge his kingdome, countreys and do∣minions, and the aduauncing and ease of his subiectes) sent thither a Pilote of S. Mallowes, a briton, named Iames Cartier,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iames Cartier</NOTE> well seene in the art and knowledge of Nauigati∣on, &amp; especially of the North parts, commonly called the new land, led by some hope to find passage that waies to the south seas: Who being not able at his first going to bring any thing to passe, that he pretēded to do: was sent thither againe the yeere following, and likewise Le sire Hemerall, and as it is well knowen they did inhabite and builde, and plant the kings armies in the North part a good way in the lande, as farre as <HI>Tauadu</HI> and <HI>Ochisaon.</HI> Wherefore (my Lord) trust iustly that a thing so commendable and worthie to bee with good courage attempted, that God woulde guid and keepe vs, desiring alwayes to fulfill your commaundement. When wee had done your businesse, and made our prepara∣tions the xviii. day of Februarie 1562 through the fauour of God wee departed with our two vessels out of the hauen of Claue de Grace into the road Caur: and the next day hoysted vp saile (the winde being in y<SUP>e</SUP> East) which lasted so fiue daies, that we coulde not arriue at the nauch that is from betweene the coast of Briton and Englande and the Iles of Surlinos and Wiskam: So that the Winde blowing with great fu∣ry and tempest out of the West, and West Southwest, alto∣gether contrary to our way and course, and all that we could doe was to none effecte, besides the great daunger of brea∣king of our Mastes, as also to be hindered in our other la∣bours. Wherefore as well to shonne many other inconueni∣ences, which might follow to the preiudice and breach of our voyage, hauing regard also to the likely daunger of death, y<SUP>e</SUP> some of our gentlemen and souldiers being troubled with feuers and whot sicknesses, might haue fallen into: as also
<PB REF="42"/> for other considerations, wee thought good to fall into the road of Brest in Britaine, to set there our sick folke on land, and suffer the tempest to passe. From whence (after wee had taried there two dayes) wee returned againe to Sea∣warde to followe our nauigation, so that (my Lorde) albeit the winde was for a long season very much against vs, and troublesome: yet at the ende (God giuing vs through his grace and accustomed goodnesse a meetely fauourable winde) I determined with all diligence to proue a newe course which hath not beene yet attempted: trauersing the Seas of Oction 1800. Leagues at the least, whiche in deed is the true and short course that hereafter must be kept, to the honour of our nation, reiecting the old conserued opi∣on, which to long time hath beene holden as true.</P>
<P>Which is, as it was thought a thing impossible to haue the winde at East, Northeast, and keepe the race and course wee enterprised, but that we shoulde be driuen towarde the region of Affrica, the Iles of Canaria, Madera, and other landes there aboutes. And the cause why we haue beene the more prouoked and assured to take this new race, hath bin be∣cause that it seemed to euery one, that we might not passe nor goe in this Nauigation without the sight and touching of the Antillies and Lucaries, and there soiourne and take fresh waters and other necessaries, as the Spaniards doe in their voyage to new spaine: wherof (thanked be God) we haue had no neede, nor entered the chanell of Roham: which hath bin thought impossible. Foreseeing also that it was not expedient for vs to passe through the Ilandes, as wel to shune many in∣conueniences that might happen in passing that way (wherof springeth nothing but innumerable quarrels, pleadings, cō∣fusions, and breach of al worthy enterprises, and goodly naui∣gations, whereof ensueth complaintes and odious questions betweene the subiectes of the king and his friends and alies) as also to the ende they might vnderstand, that in the time to come (God hauing shewed vs such graces, as these his won∣derfull benefites firste shewed to the poore people of this so
<PB REF="42"/> goodly newe framing people, of so gentle a nature, and a countrey so pleasant and fruitefull, lacking nothing at all that may seeme necessarie for mans food) we would not haue to doe with their Ilandes, and other landes: which (for that they first discouered them) they keepe with much ielousie: trusting that if God will suffer the king (through your per∣swation) to cause some part of this incomparable countrey to be peopled and inhabited with such a number of his poore subiectes as you shall thinke good, there neuer happened in the memory of man so great and good commoditie to France as this, and (my Lorde) for many causes, whereof a man is neuer able to say or write to the ful, as vnder the assured hope that we haue alwayes had in executing vprightly that which I had receiued in charge of you, God woulde blesse our wayes and nauigations. After we had constantly and with diligence in time conuenient determined vpon the way, wee shoulde haue thought it noysome and tedious to all our com∣panie, if it had before bin knowē vnto any without tourning or wauering to or fro from their first ententiō. And notwith∣standing that satan did often what he could to sowe many ob∣stractes, troubles and lettes, according to his acustomed sub∣tilties, so it is come to passe, that God by his onely goodnes hath giuen vs grace, to make the furthest arte and trauars of the seas, that euer was made in our memorie or knowledge, in longitude from the East to the West: and therefore was it commonly sayde both in Fraunce and Spaine, and also a∣mong vs, that it was impossible for vs safely to ariue thither, whither the Lord did conduct vs. Al which perswaded but of igoraunce and lacke of attempting: which wee haue not bin afrayde to giue aduenture to prooue. Albeit that all Ma∣riners Cardes doe set the Coastes with shipwrackes with∣out portes or Riuers: which wee haue found otherwise as it followeth.</P>
<P>Thursday the last of Aprill at the breake of the day, wee discouered and clearely perceyued a fayre Coast, stret∣chyng of a great length couered with an infinite number of
<PB REF="43"/> high and fayre trees, wee being not past 7. or 8. leagues from the shore, the countrey seeming vnto vs plaine without anye shewe of hils, and approching neerer within foure or fiue lea∣gues of the land, we cast an ancker at ten fadome water, the bottome of the Sea being plaine with muche Ocias and fast holde on the South side, as farre as a certaine point or Cape situate vnder that Latitude of nine and twentie degrees and a halfe, which we haue named Cape Francois.</P>
<P>Wee coulde espie neither Riuer nor Bay, wherefore wee sent our Boates furnished with men of experience, to founde and knowe the coast neere the shore: who returning to vs about one of the clock at after noone, declared that they had founde among other thinges viii. fadome of water at the harde bancke of the sea. Wherevpon hauing diligently wayed vp our Anckers, and hoysted vp our sayles with wind at will, we sayled and vewed the coast all along with vnspea∣ble pleasure, of the odorous smell and beawtie of the same. And because there appeared vnto vs no signe of any Porte, about the setting of the sunne we cast ancker againe: which done, we did behold to and fro the goodly order of the woods wherewith God hath decked euery way the sayd land. Then perceiuing towarde the North a leaping and a breaking of the water, as a streame falling out of the lande into the Sea. For the whiche wee set vp sayles againe to double the same while it was yet day. And as wee had so done, and passed be∣yond it: there appeared vnto vs a fayre entrie of a faire riuer which caused vs to cast Ancker agayne there nerer the land: to the end the next day we might see what it was, and though that the winde blew for a time vehemently to the shoreward: yet the hold and Anckerrage was so good, that one cable and one Ancker helde vs fast, with out danger or sliding.</P>
<P>The next day in the morning, being the first of May, wee assayed to enter this Porte, with two newe barges and a boate well trimmed, finding little water barges whiche might haue astonied and caused vs to returne backe to ship∣borde, if God had not speedily brought vs in. Where find∣ing 36. fadome water, entred into a goodly and great riuer,
<PB REF="43"/> which as we went founde to encrease still in depth &amp; large∣nesse, boyling and roaring through the multitude of all kind of fish. This being entred wee perceiued a great number of y<SUP>e</SUP> Indians inhabitants there, comming along the sandes &amp; Sea bankes, comming neare vnto vs, without any taking of feare or doubt, shewing vnto vs the easiest landing place: &amp; thereupon we giuing them also on our parts thanks of as∣surance and friendlinesse. Forthwith one of appearance, out of the best among them, brother vnto one of their kinges, or gouernours, commaunded one of the Indians to enter into the water: and to approch our boates to shew vs the coastes landing place. We seeing this (without any more doubting or difficultie) landed, and the messenger (after we had rewar∣ded him with some looking glasse, and other pretie things of small value) ran incontinently toward his Lord: Who forth with sent mee his girdle, in token of assuraunce and friend∣ship, which girdle was made of red leather, as well couered and coloured as was possible: and as I began to go towards him, hee set foorth and came and receiued me gently, and rei∣sed after his maner all his men, following with great silence and modestie: yea more then our men did. And after we had a while with gentle vsage congratulated with him: we fell to the grounde a litle way from them, to call vpon the name of God, and to beseech him to cōtinue still his goodnesse to∣wards vs, and bring to the knowledge of our sauiour Christ this poore people. While wee were thus praying (they sit∣ting vpon the grounde, which was strawed and dressed with Bay bowes) behelde and hearkened vnto vs, very attentiue∣ly without either speking or mouing: and as I made a signe vnto their king, lifting vp mine arme, and stretching foorth one finger, only to make them looke vp to heauen ward: He likewise lifting vp his arme towards heauen put foorth two fingers: whereby it seemed that he made vs to vnderstande, that they worshipped the Sunne and y<SUP>e</SUP> moone for Gods: as afterwardes wee vnderstoode it so. In the meane time their numbers increased, &amp; thither came the kings brother, that was first with vs, their mother, wiues, sisters and chil∣dren,
<PB REF="44"/> and being thus assembled, they caused a great number of Bay boughes to bee cut, and therewith a place to be dres∣sed for vs, distant from theirs two fadom. For it is their ma∣ner to talke and bargaine sitting: and the chiefe of them to bee apart, from the meaner sort, with a shewe of great obe∣dience to their kinges, superiours, and elders. They bee all naked, and of a goodly stature, mightie, &amp; as well shapen &amp; proportioned of body, as any people in y<SUP>e</SUP> world: very gentle, curteous, and of a good nature.</P>
<P>The most part of them couer their raines and priuities with faire Harts skinnes, painted most commonly with sun∣drie colours: and the fore part of their body and armes, bee painted with pretie deuised workes, of Azure, red, and blacke, so well and so properly as the best Painter of Eu∣rope coulde not amende it. The women haue their bo∣dies painted with a certaine Herbe like vnto Mosse, where∣of the Cedar trees, and all other trees bee alwayes couered. The men for pleasure doe alwayes trimme them selues therwith, after sundrie fashions: They bee of tauny colour, hauke nosed, and of a pleasant countenance. The women be well fauoured, and will not suffer one dishonestly to approch too neare them. But wee were not in their houses for we sawe none at that time.</P>
<P>After we had taried in this North side of the riuer the most part of the day (which riuer wee haue called May,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the riuer of May was so called.</NOTE> for that wee discouered the same the firste day of the Moneth) wee congratulated, made aliaunce, and entred into ami∣tie with them, and presented the king and his brethren with Gownes of blewe cloth garnished with yellowe Floure de∣luces. And it seemed that they were sory for our departure: so that the most part of them entred into the water vp to the necke, to set our boates a flote.</P>
<P>Putting into vs sundry kinde of fishes, which with mer∣ueilous speede they ranne to take in their packs, made in the water with great Reedes, so well and cunningly set togea∣ther, after the fashion of a Laberinth, or Maze, with so many
<PB REF="44"/> turnes and crookes, as it is impossible to do it without much cunning and industrie.</P>
<P>But desiring to imploy the rest of the day on the other side of this riuer, to viewe and know those Indians that wee sawe there. We trauersed thither, and without any diffi∣cultie landed amongest them, who receiued vs very gently and with great humanitie: putting vs of their fruites, euen into our boates, Mulberies, Raspis, and such other fruites as they founde ready by the way.</P>
<P>Soone after this came thither the king with his brethren, and others with bowes and arrowes in their handes, vsing therewithall a goodly and a graue fashion, with their beha∣uiour right souldierlike, and as warlike boldnes as may be. They were naked and painted as the other, their haire like∣wise long, and trussed vp (with a lace made of herbes) to the top of their heads: but they had neither their wiues nor chil∣dren in their companie. After we had a good while louingly enterteined and presented them with like gifts of habersher wares, cutting hookes and hatchets, and clothed the king &amp; his brethren with like robes, as we had giuen to them on the other side: we entred and viewed the countrie thereaboutes, which is the fairest, fruitfullest, &amp; pleasantest of al the world, abounding in hony, venison, wilde foule, forests, woods of all sortes, Palme trees, Cypresse and Cedars, Bayes y<SUP>e</SUP> high∣est and greatest, with also the fayrest vines in all the world, with grapes according, which without natural art and with∣out mans helpe or trimming will grow to toppes of Okes, and other trees that be of a wonderfull greatnesse &amp; height. And the sight of the faire medowes is a pleasure not able to be expressed with tongue: full of Hernes, Curlues, Bitters, Mallards, Egrepths, woodcocks, &amp; all other kinde of small birds: with Harts, Hindes, Buckes, wilde Swine, and all other kindes of wilde beastes, as we perceiued well both by their footing there, and also afterwardes in other places, by their crie and roaring in the night.</P>
<P>Also there be Conies &amp; Hares: Silke wormes in meruei∣lous number, a great deale fairer and better, then be our silk
<PB REF="45"/> wormes. To bee short, it is a thing vnspeakeable to consider the thinges that bee seene there, and shalbe founde more and more, in this incomperable lande, which neuer yet broken with plough yrons, bringeth forth al things according to his first nature, wherewith the eternall God indued it. A∣bout their houses they labour and till the grounde, sowing their fieldes with a graine called Mahis, whereof they make their meale: and in their Gardens they plant beanes, gourdes, cucumbers, Citrons, peason, and many other fruits and rootes vnknowen vnto vs. Their spades and mat∣tocks be made of Wood, so well and fitly as is possible: which they make with certaine stones, oyster shelles &amp; mus∣cles, wherewith also they make their bowes and smal laun∣ces: and cut &amp; polish all sortes of wood, that they imploye a∣bout their buildings, and necessarie vse: There groweth al∣so many Walnut trees, Hasell trees, Cheritrees, very faire and great.</P>
<P>And generally wee haue seene, thereof the same simples and herbes that wee haue in Fraunce, and of the like good∣nesse, sauour and taste. The people be very good archers, and of great strength: Their bowe stringes are made of Leather, and their arrowes of Reedes which they doe head with the teeth of fishes. As we now demaunded of them con∣cerning y<SUP>e</SUP> land called Seuola, whereof some haue written not to bee farre from thence, and to bee situate within the lande,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seuola within xx. daies trauai∣ling by boate of the riuer of May.</NOTE> and toward the Sea called the South Sea. They shewed vs by signes that which we vnderstood well enough, that they might goe thither with their Boates (by riuers) in twentie dayes. They that haue written of this kingdome and towne of Seuola, and other townes and kingdomes thereaboutes, say, that there is great aboundance of golde and siluer, precious stones, and other great riches: and that the people had their arrowes headed (in steede of yron) with sharpe pointed Turquesses. Thus the night appro∣ching, it was conuenient for vs to returne by day a ship∣boorde. Wee tooke leaue of them muche to their griefe, but more to ours without comparison, for that wee
<PB REF="45"/> had no meane to enter the riuers with our shippe. And al∣beit, it was not their custome eyther to eate or drinke from the Sunne rising till his going downe: yet the king open∣ly woulde needes drinke with vs, praying vs verie gently to giue him the cuppe whereout we had drunke: and so making him to vnderstande that wee woulde see him againe the next day, we retired to our shippes, which lay aboue sixe leagues from the hauen to the sea.</P>
<P>The next day in the morning we returned to land againe, accompanied with the Captaines, Gentlemen, and Souldi∣ers, and other of our small trope: cariyng with vs a Pillour or columne of harde stone, our kings armes graued therein, to plant and set the same in the enterie of the Porte in some high place, where it might bee easely seene, and being come thither before the Indians were assembled, we espied on the south syde of the Riuer a place very fitte for that purpose, vp∣on a litle hill, compassed with Cypres, Bayes, Paulmes and other trees, with sweete smelling and pleasant shrubbes. In the middle whereof we planted the first bound or limit of his Maiestie. This done perceiuing our first Indians assem∣bled, not without some misliking of those on the South parte, where we had set the limitte, who taried for vs in the same place where they met with vs the day before, seeming vnto vs that there is some enimitie betweene them and the others. But when they perceyued our long tarying on this side, they ran to see what we had done in that place where we landed first, and had set our limitte: which they vewed a great while without touching it any way, or abassing, or euer spea∣king to vs therof at any time after. Howebeit we could skāt depart but as it were w<SUP>t</SUP> griefe of minde frō this our first alli∣ance, they rowing vnto vs all along the riuer from all parts and presenting vs with some of their harts skins, painted and vnpainted, meale, litle cakes, freshe water, rootes like vnto Rinbabe which they haue in great estimation, and make ther∣of a potion of medicine: also they brought litle bagges of redde colours and some small spices like vnto Vire, percey∣uing
<PB REF="46"/> among them selues fayre thinges painted as it had bin with graine of scarlet, showing vnto vs by signes that they had in the lande golde and siluer and copper: whereof wee haue brought some,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gold, siluer, and copper in Flori∣da. Turquesses and aboundance of pearles. Marshes.</NOTE> Also lead like vnto ours which we shew∣ed. Also turquesses and great aboundance of pearles whiche as they declared vnto vs they tooke out of oysters, whereof there is taken euer along the riuer side, &amp; among the reedes, and in the marshes: and so merueylous aboundance as is skant credible: and we haue perceiued that there be as many and as faire pearles found there as in any countrey of the worlde. For wee sawe a man of theirs as we entered into our boates, that had a pearle hanging at a coller of golde and siluer about his necke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pearles as big as acornes.</NOTE> as great as an Acorne at y<SUP>e</SUP> least. This man as he had taken fishe in one of their fishing packs there∣by brought that same to our boates, and our men perceiuing the greatnesse therof, one of them putting his finger toward it, the man drewe backe, and woulde no more come neare the boate: not for any feare that he had that they woulde haue ta∣ken his Coller &amp; Pearle from him for he would haue giuen it them, for a looking glasse or a knife:</P>
<P>But that hee doubted lest they woulde haue pulled him in∣to the boate, &amp; so by force haue caried him away. He was one of the goodliest men of all the company. But for that we had no leasure to tary any longer with them, the day being well passed, whiche greeued vs, for the commoditie and great ri∣ches, whiche as wee vnderstoode and sawe might bee gotten there, desiring also to employ the rest of the day with our se∣conde aliance the Indians on the southside, as we perceiuer them the day before, which still taried looking for vs: Wee passed the riuer to their shore, where as wee founde them ta∣riyng for vs, quietly and in good order, with newe paintings vpon their face, and feathers vpon their heade: the King with his Bowe and Arrowes lying by him, sate on the grounde strawed with boughes betweene his two brethren, whiche were goodly men and well shapen and of a wonderfull show of actiuities, hauing vpon their heades, one haire trussed
<PB REF="46"/> vpright of heyght, of some kinde of wild beast gathered and wrought together with great cunning, wrethed and fasted after the forme of a Diademe. One of them had hanging a∣bout his necke a rounde plate of redde copper well poli∣shed, with one other lesser of Siluer in the middest of it, &amp; at his eare a litle plate of Copper wherewith they vse to stripe the sweat from their bodies. They shewed vs that there was greatstore of this mettell within the countrey, about fiue or sixe daies iourney from thence, both in the southside &amp; north∣side of the same riuers, and that they went thither in their Boates. Which Boates they make but of one piece of a tree, woorking it whole so cunningly and featly, that they put in one of these boates fifteene or twentie persons, and go their wayes very safely. They that rowe stande vpright ha∣uing their ores short after the fashion of a Peele. Thus being among them they presented vs with meale dressed &amp; baked, very good &amp; wel tasted, and of good nourishmēt, also beanes, and fish, as crabbes, lobstars, creuises, and many other kinde of good fishes, shewing vs by signes y<SUP>t</SUP> their dwellings were farre off, and if their prouision had been neere hande, they woulde haue presented vs with manye other refresh∣inges.</P>
<P>The night nowe approching, we were faine to returne to our Shippe, very much to our griefe: for that wee durste not hazarde to enter with our Shippe, by reason of a barre of lande, that was at the enterie of the Porte, howe be it, at a full Sea there is two fadome and a halfe of water at the least, and it is but a leape ouer a surge to passe this Barre, not passing the length of two cables, and then forthwith e∣uery where within sixe or seuen fadome water. So that it maketh a very fayre hauen, and Shippes of a meane burden from fourescore to a hundred tunnes may enter therein at all floodes, yea of a farre greater burthen, if there were French men dwelling there that might skoure the enterye as they doe in Fraunce: for there is nothing lacking for the lyfe of man. The situation is vnder the eleuation of xxx. degrees, a good climate healthfull, and of a good
<PB REF="47"/> temperature, merueilous pleasāt, y<SUP>e</SUP> people good, &amp; of a good and amiable nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gentlenes must be vsed towards them.</NOTE> which willingly will obay: yea be con∣tent to serue those that shall with gentlenes and humanitie goe about to allure them, as it is needful for those that be sent thither hereafter so to doe, and as I haue charged those that be left there to do, to the ende they may aske and learne of thē where they take their gold, copper, and turquesses, and other thinges yet vnknowen vnto vs: by reason of the time we so∣iourned there. For if any rude or rigorous meanes should be vsed towards this people, they woulde flie hither and thither through the Woods and Forests, and abandon their habita∣tions and countreys.</P>
<P>The next day being the thirde day of May, desiring al∣waies to finde out harbours to rest in, we set vp saile againe: And after we had raunged the coast as neere the shore as we could, there appeared vnto vs about seuen leagues of on this side of y<SUP>e</SUP> riuer of May a great opening or Bay of some riuer, whither with one of our boates we rowed, &amp; there found one entrie almost like y<SUP>t</SUP> of the riuer of May, and within the same as great a depth, and as large a diuiding it selfe into many great streames, great and broade stretchinges towardes the high lande, with many other lesse, that diuide the coun∣trey into faire and great landes and great number of small and fayre Medowes. Being entred into them about three leagues, wee found in a place very commodious, strong, and pleasant of situation, certayne Indians, who receiued vs ve∣ry gently: Howe be it, we being somewhat neare their hou∣ses, it seemed it was somewhat against their good willes that we went thither, for at their cries and noyses they made their wiues and children and hoshoulde stuffe to be caried into the Woods: Howe be it they suffered vs to goe into their hou∣ses, but they themselues woulde not accompany vs thither. Their houses bee made of Wood fitly and close, set vpright and couered with Reedes: the most part of them after the fa∣shion of a pauilion. But there was one house amongest the rest verie long and broade, with settles rounde about made
<PB REF="47"/> of Reedes trimly couched together, which serue them both for beddes and seates, they be of height two foote from the grounde, set vpon great rounde pillers painted with red, ye∣lowe, and blewe, well and trimlie polished: some sorte of this people perceiuing that we had in no maner wise hurted their dwellings nor gardens whiche they dressed very diligently, they returned all vnto vs before our inbarking, seeming very well contented by their giuing vnto vs water, fruites, and Hart skinnes. It is a place wonderfull fertill, and of strong situatiō, the ground fat, so that it is likely that it would bring forth Wheate and all other corne twise a yeere,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great fertilitie.</NOTE> and the com∣modities for liuelihood, and the hope of more riches, bee like vnto those we found and considered vpon the riuer of May, without comming into the sea: this arme doth diuide, and maketh many other Iles of May, as also many other great Ilandes: by the which wee trauell from one Ilande to ano∣ther, betweene lande and land.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> And it seemeth that men may sayle without danger through al the countrey, and neuer en∣ter into the great sea, which were a wonderfull aduantage.</P>
<P>This is the lande of Checere whereof some haue written, &amp; which many haue gone about to find out, for y<SUP>e</SUP> great riches they perceiued by some Indians to be founde there. It is set vnder so good a climate, that none of our men (though wee were there in the hotest time of the yeere, the sunne entring into Cancer) were troubled with any sicknesses. The people there liue long and in great health and strength, so that the a∣ged men goe without slaues, and are able to goe and runne like the youngest of them, who onely are knowen to be olde by the wrinckles in their face, and decay of sight. Wee de∣parted from them verie friendly, &amp; with their contentation. But the night ouertaking vs, we were constrayned to lye in our ships all that night, till it was day, floting vpon this ri∣uer which we haue called Sene,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The riuer of Sene.</NOTE> because that the entery of it is as broade as from hauer degrace vnto Honesleue. At the breake of the day wee espied out of the South syde one of the fayrest, pleasauntest, and greatest medowe grounde
<PB REF="48"/> that might bee seene, into the which wee went, finding at the very entrie a long, faire, and great Lake, and an innumera∣ble number of footesteps of great Hartes and Hindes of a wonderfull greatnesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heardes of tame Hartes.</NOTE> the steppes beeing all fresh and new, and it seemeth that the people doe nourishe them like tame Cattell in great heards: for we saw the steppes of an Indian that folowed them.</P>
<P>The Chanell and depth of this riuer of Seyne, is one y<SUP>t</SUP> side of the medowe that is in the Ile of May. Being retur∣ned to our ships, we sayled to knowe more and more of this coast, goying as neere the shore as we coulde. And as wee had sayled about sixe or seuen leagues, there appeared vnto us another Bay, where we cast anker, and tarrying so all the night, in the morning wee went thither, and finding (by our founding) at the entrie many bankes and beatings, we durst not enter there with our great ship, hauing named the riuer Somme, which is 8. 9. 10. 11. fadome depth, diuiding it selfe into many great Ilands, and small goodly medow grounds and pastures, and euery where such abundance of fish as is incredible, and on the Weast Northwest side, there is a great riuer that commeth frō the countrie of a great length ouer: and another on the Northeast side, which returne into the Sea. So that (my Lord) it is a countrie full of hauens, ri∣uers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Good hauens and riuers.</NOTE> and Ilands, of such fruitfulnes as cannot with tongue be expressed: and where in short time great and precious cō∣modities might bee found.<NOTE PLACE="marg">7. Great &amp; good riuers.</NOTE> And besides this wee discouered and found also vii. riuers more, as great and as good, cutting and diuiding the land into faire and great Ilands. The In∣dians inhabitants there be like in manners, &amp; the countrie in fertillitie apt and commodious throughout to beare &amp; bring foorth plentifully all that men would plant or sowe vpon it. There bee euery where the highest and greatest Firtrees y<SUP>t</SUP> can be seene, very well smelling, and where out might bee gathered (with cutting the only bark) as much Rosen, Tur∣pentine, &amp; Frākēsence, as men would desire. And to be short there lacketh nothing. Wherefore being not able to enter &amp; lie with our great vessels there, we could make no long abi∣ding,
<PB REF="48"/> nor enter so farre into the riuers and countries as wee would faine haue done: for it is well knowne how many in∣conueniences haue happened vnto men, not only in attemp∣ting of newe discoueries, but also in all places by leauing their great vessels in the Sea, farre from the land, vnfurni∣shed of the heads and best men. As for y<SUP>t</SUP> other riuers we haue giuen them names as followeth: and vnto the Ilandes ioy∣ning vnto them, the same name that the next riuer vnto it hath, as you shall see by the portratures or Cardes<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maps and Sea Cardes.</NOTE> y<SUP>t</SUP> I haue made thereof. As to the fourth name of Loire, to y<SUP>e</SUP> fift Char∣net, to y<SUP>e</SUP> sixt Carō to the 7. riuer Belle, to y<SUP>e</SUP> 8. riuer Graūde, to the 9. port Royall, and to the tenth Belle Virrir.</P>
<P>Vpon Whitsunday the xxvii. day of May, after wee had perceiued and considered that there was no remedie, but to assay to find the meanes to harber our ships, as wel to amend and trimme them, as to get vs fresh water, wood, and other necessaries, whereof wee hauing opinion that there was no fayrer or fitter place for the purpose, then port Royall.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Port royall a most excellent hauen.</NOTE> And when wee had sounded the entrie and the Chanell (thanked be God) wee entered safely therein with our shippes, a∣gainst the opinion of many, finding the same one of the fay∣rest and greatest Hauens of the worlde.</P>
<P>Howe be it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> it must be remembred least men approching neare it within seuen leagues of the lande, bee abashed and a∣fraide on the Eastside, drawing towarde the Southeast, the grounde to be flatte, for neuerthelesse at a full sea, there is e∣uery where foure fadome water, keeping the right Chanel.</P>
<P>In this part there are many riuers of meane bignesse and large, where without daunger the greatest shippes of the worlde might bee harboured, which wee founde, no In∣dian inhabiting there aboutes. The Porte and Riuers side is neerer then tenne or twelue leages vpwardes into the countreys, although it bee one of the goodliest, best, and fruitefullest countreys that euer was seene, and where no∣thing lacketh, and also where as good and likely com∣modities bee founde as in other places thereby.</P>
<P>For wee founde there a great number of Pepertrees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pepper tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</NOTE>
<PB REF="49"/> the Pepper yet greene, and not ready to bee gathered: Also the best water of the world, and so many sortes of fishes that yee may take them without net or angle so many as ye will. Also an innumerable sort of wilde foule of all sortes, and in little Ilandes at the entrie of this hauen, on the East North∣east side, there is so great number of Egrepes that the bus∣shes bee all white and couered with them, so that one may take of the young ones with his hande as many as hee will carry away. There bee also a number of other foules, as Hernes, Bitters, Curlues. And to bee short, there is so ma∣ny small byrdes that it is a strange thing to bee seene. Wee founde the Indians there more doubtfull and fearefull then the others before: Yet after we had been in their houses, and congregated with them, and shewed curtesie to those that we founde to haue abandoned there through boats meale, victu∣all, and small housholde stuffe, and both in not taking awaye or touching any part thereof, and in leauing in that place where they dressed their meate, Kniues, Looking glasses, little Beades of glasse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A speciall note.</NOTE> which they loue and esteeme aboue golde and pearles, for to hang them at their eares and neck, and to giue them to their wiues and children: they were somewhat emboldened.</P>
<P>For some of them came to our boates, of the which wee carried two goodly and strong aboorde our shippes, clothing and vsing them as gently as it was possible. But they ceased not day nor nyght to lament, and at length they escaped a∣way. Wherefore albeit, I was willing (according to your commaundement and memoriall) to bring away some of them with vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A commande∣ment.</NOTE> on the Princes behalfe and yours, I forbare to doe so for many considerations and reasons that they told mee, and for that we were in doubt that (leauing some of our men there to inhabite) all the Countrie, men, women, and children, woulde not haue ceased to pursue them for to haue theirs againe: seeing they bee not able to consider and way to what entent wee shoulde haue carried them away: &amp; this may bee better doone to their contentation, when they haue better acquaintance of vs, and know that there is no suche
<PB REF="49"/> crueltie in vs, as in other people and nations, of whom they haue beene beguiled vnder colour of good faith: whiche do∣ing in the ende turned to the doers no good. This is the ri∣uer of Iordain in mine opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The riuer of Iordan.</NOTE> whereof so much hath beene spokē, which is very faire &amp; the coūtrie good, both for y<SUP>t</SUP> easie habitation, and also for many other things, which should bee long to write.</P>
<P>The twentie of May wee planted another columne or pillor grauen with the kinges armes on the South side, in a high place, of the entrie of a great riuer, which wee called Libourne: where there is a lake of fresh water very good, and on the same side a little lower towards the entrie of the Hauen is one of the fayrest fountaines that a man may drink of, which falleth by violence down to the riuer from an high place out of a red and sandy ground, and yet for all that fruitefull and of good ayre, where it shoulde seeme that the Indians haue had some faire habitation.</P>
<P>There we sawe the fayrest &amp; the greatest vines with grapes according, and young trees, and smal woods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exceeding faire and great vines</NOTE> very wel smel∣ling, that euer were seen: wherby it appeareth to be the plea∣santest &amp; most commodious dwelling of al y<SUP>e</SUP> world. Where∣fore (my Lorde) trusting you will not thinke it amisse (consi∣dering the commodities that may be brought thence) if we leaue a number of men there, which may fortifie and prouide them selues of things necessary:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fortification most necessarie in all newe dis∣coueries.</NOTE> for in all new discoueries it is the chiefest thing that may be done, at the beginning to fortifie and people the countrey. I had not so soone set forth this to our companie, but many of them affraid to tary there, yet with such a good will and ioly corage, that such a number did thus offer themselues, as we had much to do to stay their importunitie.</P>
<P>And namely of our shipmaisters and principall pilotes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30. lefte behind at their owne suite</NOTE> and such as we could not spare. How bee it, wee lefte there but to the number of thirtie in all, Gentlemen, souldiers, and marriners, and that at their own suit and prayer, and of their owne free willes, and by the aduice and deliberation of the Gentlemen sent on the behalfe of the Prince and yours.</P>
<PB REF="50"/>
<P>And haue left vnto the forehead and rulers (following therein your good will) Captaine Albert de la Pierria, a souldier of long experience, and the first that from the begin∣ning did offer to tarry.

<P>After we had instructed and duly admonished them of that they shoulde doe (as well for their maner of proceeding, as for the good and louing behauiour of them) the xi. day of the moneth of Iune last past, we departed from port Royal: min∣ding yet to range and view the coast vntill the xl. degrees of the eleuation:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fortie degrees of eleuation.</NOTE> But for as much as there came vpon vs trou∣blesome and cloudie weather, very incommodious for our purpose, and considering also amongst many other thinges, that we had spent our cables and furniture thereof, which is the most principall thing that longeth to them that go to dis∣couer countreys, where continually both night and day they must lie at ancker: also our victualls beeing perished and spilte, our lacke of Boateswaines to set forth our rowe bar∣ges, and leaue our vessels furnished.

<HEAD>❧ <HI>Notes in writing besides more priuie by mouth that were giuen by a Gentleman,</HI> Anno. 1580 to M. Arthure Pette and to M. Charles Iack∣man, sent by the marchants of the Muscouie companie for the discouerie of the northeast strayte, not altogether vnfit for some other enterprises of discouerie, hereaf∣ter to bee taken in hande.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>What respect of Ilandes is to be had, and why.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hereas the Portingales haue in their course to their Indies in the Southeast, certaine portes and fortificatiōs to thrust into by the way, to diuers great purpo∣ses? So you are to see what Ilands, and what portes you had neede to haue by the way in your course, to the Northeast. For which cause I wish you to enter into consideration of the matter, &amp; to note all the Ilands, &amp; to set them downe in p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at, to two endes, that is to say, That wee may deuise to take the benefite by them. And also foresee how by thē the Sauages or ciuill Princes, may in any sort anoy vs in our purposed trade that way.</P>
<P>And for that the people to the which wee purpose in this voyage to goe, be no Christians, it were good that the masse of our commodities were alwayes in our owne disposition, and not at the will of others. Therefore it were good that we did seeke out some small Iland in the Scithian Sea, where we might plant, Fortifie, &amp; Staple safely, frō whēce (as time shoulde serue) wee might feede those heathen nations with our commodities without cloying them, or without venturing our hole masse in the bowels of their countrey.</P>
<P>And to whiche Ilande if neede were (and if we shoulde thinke so good) we might allure the Northeast nauie, the na∣uie of Cambalu to resort with their commodities to vs there planted, and stapling there.</P>
<PB REF="52"/>
<P>And if such an Iland might be found so standing as might shorten our course, and so standing, as that the Nauie of Cā∣balu, or other those parties might cōueniently saile vnto w<SUP>t</SUP>∣out their dislike in respect of distāce: thē would it fal out wel. For so, besides lesse daūger, and more safetie, our ships might there vnlade and lade againe, and returne the selfe same som∣mer to the ports of England or of Norway.</P>
<P>And if such an Iland may be found for the stabling of our commodities, to the which they of Cambalu would not saile, yet we might, hauing shippes there, imploy them in passing betweene Cambalu and that stapling place.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Respect of hauens and harbarowes.</HEAD>
<P>ANd if no such Ilandes may be found in the Scithiā sea toward the firme of Asia, then are you to search out the ports that be about Noua Sembla all along the tract of that land, to the end you may winter there the first yeere, if you be let by contrarie winds, &amp; to the ende that if wee may in short time come vnto Cābalu, &amp; vnlade and set saile againe for re∣turne without ventering, there at Cābalu, that you may on your way come as farre in returne as a port about Noua sē∣bla: That the Sommer following, you may the sooner be in England for the more speedy vent of your East cōmodities, and for the speedier discharge of your Mariners: if you can not goe forward and backe in one selfe same sommer.</P>
<P>And touching the tract of the land of Noua sembla, to∣ward the East out of the circle Artick in the more temperate zone, you are to haue regard, for if you finde the soyle plan∣ted with people, it is like y<SUP>t</SUP> in time an ample vēt of our warm wollē clothes may be founde. And if there be no people at al there to be found, then you shall specially note what plentie of whales, &amp; of other fish is to be found there, to the end wee may turne our newfoūd land fishing or Island fishing, or our whalefishing, y<SUP>t</SUP> way for the ayde &amp; cōfort of our new trades to the Northeast, to the coasts of Asia.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat the first Seate be chosen on y<SUP>e</SUP> seaside so as (if it may be) you may haue your owne Na∣uie within Bay, riuer or lake, within your seat safe from the enemie. And so as the enemie shalbe forced to lie in opē rode abroade without, to be disper∣sed with all windes and tem∣pests that shall arise. Thus seated you shall bee least subiecte to annoy of the enemie, so may you by your Nauie within, passe out to all partes of the worlde, and so may the shippes of Englande haue accesse to you to supply all wantes, so may your commodities be cari∣ed away also. This seate is to bee chosen in temperate Cli∣mat, in sweete ayre, where you may possesse alwayes sweete water, wood, seacoles, or curse, with fish, flesh, grayne, fruits, herbes and rootes, or so many of those, as may suffice very necessitie for the life of such as shall plant there. And for the possessing of mines of golde, of siluer, copper, quicksiluer, or of any suche precious thing, the wantes of diuers of those needfull thinges may be supplied from some other place by sea, &amp;c.</P>
<LIST>
<HEAD>are to be looked for as thinges without which no Citie may bee made nor people in ciuill sorte be kept together.</HEAD>
<ITEM>Stone to make Lyme of.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Slate stone to tile withall or suche clay as maketh tyle,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Stone to wall withal if
<PB REF="58"/> Brycke may not bee made,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Timber for building ease∣ly to be conueied to the place,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Reede to couer houses or such like, if tile or slate be not.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The people there to plant and to continue are eyther to liue without trafficke, or by trafficke and by trade of mar∣chandize. If they shall liue without sea trafficke, at the first they become naked by want of linen and wollen, and very miserable by infinite wantes that will otherwise ensue, and so will they be forced of them selues to depart, or els easely they will bee consumed by the Sp. by the Fr. or by the na∣turall inhabithantes of the countrey, and so the interprice becomes reprochfull to our nation, and a lett to many o∣ther good purposes that may be taken in hande.</P>
<P>And by trade of marchandize they can not liue, excepte the sea or the lande there may yeelde commoditie for com∣moditie. And therefore you ought to haue most speciall re∣garde of that point, and so to plant, that the naturall com∣modities of the place and seate, may drawe to you accesse of Nauigation for the same, or that by your owne Nauigation you may carie the same out, and fetche home the supplye of the wantes of the seate.</P>
<P>Such nauigation so to bee employed, shall besides the supply of wantes, bee able to encounter with forreyne force.</P>
<P>And for that in the ample vente of suche thinges as are brought to you out of engl. by sea, standeth a matter of great consequence, it behoueth that all humanitie and curtesie and much forbearing of reuenge to the inland people be vsed, so shall you haue firme amitie with your neyghbours, so shall you haue their inland commodities to maintayne trafficke, &amp; so shall you waxe rich and strong in force. Diuers &amp; seue∣rall commodities of the inland are not in great plentie to be brought to your handes, without the ayde of some portable or Nauigable ryuer, or ample lacke, and therefore to haue
<PB REF="58"/> the helpe of suche a one is most requisite: And so is it of effecte for the dispersing of your owne commodities in ex∣change into the inlandes.</P>
<P>Nothing is more to be indeuoured with the Inland peo∣ple then familiaritie. For so may you best discouer al the na∣turall commodities of their countrey, and also all their wantes, all their strengthes, all their weakenesse, and with whome they are in warre, and with whome confiderate in peace and amitie, &amp;c. whiche knowen, you may woorke many great effectes of greatest consequence.</P>
<P>And in your planting the consideration of the climate and of the soyle bee matters that are to bee respected. For if it be so that you may let in the salt sea water, not mixed with the fresh into flattes, where the sunne is of the heate that it is at Rochell, in the Bay of portingall, or in Spaine, then may you procure a man of skill, and so you haue wonne one noble commoditie for the fishing, and for trade of mar∣chandize by making of Salt.</P>
<P>Or if the soyle and clymate bee such as may yeelde you the Grape as good as that at Burdeus, as that in Portin∣gale, or as that about Siui in Spaine, or that in the Ilands of the Canaries, then there resteth but a woorkeman to put in execution to make wines, and to dresse Resings of the sunne and other, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Or if you finde a soyle of the temperature of the South part of Spaine or Barbarie, in whiche you finde the Olif tree to growe: Then you may bee assured of a noble mar∣chandize for this realme, considering that our great trade of clothing doth require oyle, and weying howe deere of late it is become by the vent they haue of that commoditie in the West Indies, and if you finde the wilde olif there it may be graffed.</P>
<P>Or if you can finde the berrie of Cochenile with whiche wee colour Stammelles, or any Roote, Berrie, Fruite, wood or earth fitte for dying, you winne a notable thing fitt
<PB REF="59"/> for our state of clothing. This Cochenile is naturall in the west Indies on that firme.</P>
<P>Or if you haue hides of beastes fit for sole Lether, &amp;c. It wilbe a marchandize right good, and the sauages there yet can not canne Lether after our kinde, yet excellently after their owne maner.</P>
<P>Or if the soyle shall yeelde Figges, Almondes, Sugar Canes, Quinces, Orenges, Lemons, Potatos, &amp;c. there may arise some trade and trafficke, by figges, almonds, su∣gar, marmelade, Sucket &amp;c.</P>
<P>Or if great woods bee founde, if they be of Cypres, chests may bee made, if they bee of some kinde of trees, pitche and tarre may be made, if they bee of some other then they may yeelde Rosin, Trupentine, &amp;c. and al for trade and trafficke, and Caskes for wine and oyle may be made: likewise ships and houses, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And because trafficke is a thing so materiall, I with that great obseruation be taken what euery soyle yeeldeth natu∣rally, in what commoditie soeuer, and what it may be made to yeeld by indeuour, and to send vs notice home, that there∣vppon wee may deuise what meanes may be thought of to rayse trades.</P>
<P>Nowe admit that we might not be suffered by the sauages to enioy any whole countrey or any more thē the scope of a Citie, yet if wee might enioy trafficke and be assured of the same, wee might bee much inriched, our Nauie might be increased, &amp; a place of safetie might there be found, if change of religion or ciuill warres shoulde happen in this realme, which are thinges of great benefite. But if we may inioy any large Territorie of apt soyle, we might so vse the mat∣ter, as we should not depende vpon Spaine for oyles, sacks, resinges, orenges, lemons, Spanish skinnes, &amp;c. Nor vppon Fraunce for wood, baysalt, and gascoyne wines, nor on Est∣lande for flaxe, pitch, tarre, mastes, &amp;c. So we shoulde not so exhaust our treasure, and so exceedingly inriche our doubt∣full friendes, as we doe, but shoulde purchasse the commodi∣ties that we want for halfe the treasure that now we do: but
<PB REF="59"/> should by our own industries &amp; the benefits of the soile there cheapely purches oyles, wines, salt, fruits, pitch, tarre, flaxe, hempe, mastes, boordes, fishe, gold, siluer, copper, tallowe, hides and many commodities: besides if there be no flates to make salt on, if you haue plentie of wood you may make it in sufficient quantitie for common vses at home there.</P>
<P>If you can keepe a safe hauen, although you haue not the friendship of the neere neyghbours, yet you may haue traf∣ficke by sea vpon one shore or other, vpon that firme in time to come, if not present.</P>
<P>If you finde great plenty of tymber on the shore side or vpon any portable riuer, you were best to cut downe of the same the first wynter, to bee seasoned for shippes, barkes, botes and houses.</P>
<P>And if neere such wood there be any riuer or brooke vpon the which a sawing mill may be placed, it woulde doe great seruice, and therefore consideration woulde bee had of suche place.</P>
<P>And if such port &amp; chosē place of setling were in possessiō &amp; after fortified by art, although by y<SUP>e</SUP> land side our Englishmē were kept in, and might not inioy any traffick with the next neighbours, nor any vittel: yet might they vittel themselues of fishe to serue verie necessitie, and enter into amitie with the enemies of their next neighbours, &amp; so haue vent of their marchandize of England and also haue vittel, or by meanes herevpon to be vsed to force the next neighbours to amitie. And keeping a nauie at the setling place, they shoulde finde out along the tracte of the lande to haue trafficke, and at diuers Ilandes also. And so this first seate might in time become a stapling place of the commodities of many countreys and territories, and in tyme this place myght be∣come of all the prouinces round about the only gouernour. And if the place first chosē should not so wel please our peo∣ple, as some other more lately founde out: There might bee an easie remoue, and that might be rased, or rather kept for others of our nation to auoyde an ill neyghbour, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If the soyles adioyning to such conuenient hauen and
<PB REF="60"/> setling places be founde marshie and boggie, then men skil∣ful in draining are to be caried thither. For arte may worke wonderfull effectes therein, and make the soyle rich for ma∣ny vses.</P>
<P>To plante vppon an Ilande in the mouth of some nota∣ble riuer, or vpon the poynt of the lande entring into the ri∣uer, if no such Iland be, were to great ende. For if such riuer were nauigable or portable farre into the lande, then would arise great hope of planting in fertill soyles, and trafficke on the one or on thother side of the riuer, or on both, or the lin∣king in amitie with one or other petie king contēding there for dominion.</P>
<P>Such riuers founde, both barges and boates may bee made for the safe passage of such as shal perce y<SUP>e</SUP> same. These to bee couered with doubles of course linnen artificially wrought, to defend the arrow or the dart of the sauage from the rower.</P>
<P>Since euery soyle of the world by arte may be made to yeelde things to feede and to cloth man, bring in your re∣turne a perfect note of the soyle without and within, and we shall deuise if neede require to amende the same, &amp; to draw it to more perfectiō. And if you finde not fruits in your plan∣ting place to your liking, we shal in v. drifats furnish you w<SUP>t</SUP> such kinds of plants to be caried thither y<SUP>e</SUP> winter after your planting, as shall the very next summer folowing, yeeld you some fruite, and the yere next folowing, as much as shal suf∣fice a towne as big as Callice, and that shortly after shall be able to yeeld you great store of strong durable good sider to drinke, &amp; these trees shalbe able to increase you within lesse then vii. yeres as many trees presently to beare, as may suf∣fice the people of diuers parishes, which at the first setling may stand you in great steade, if the soyle haue not the com∣moditie of fruites of goodnesse already. And because you ought greedily to hunt after thinges that yeelde present re∣liefe, without trouble of cariage thither, therefore I make mencion of these, thus specially, to the ende you may haue it specially in mynde.</P>

<P>This is the forme of a Mappe sent 1527. from Smill in Spayne by maister Robert Thorne marchaunt, to Doctor Ley Embassadour for king Henry the 8. to Charles the Emperour. And although the same in this present time may seeme rude, yet I haue set it out, be∣cause his booke coulde not well be vnderstood without the same. The imperfection of which Mappe may be excused by that tyme: the knowledge of Cosmographie not then be∣yng entred among our Marchauntes, as nowe it is.</P>
