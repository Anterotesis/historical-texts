<HEAD>A <HI>DISCRIPTION</HI> OF TREDAGH IN IRELAND.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">With the <HI>Antiquity, Scituation, Natural Strength,</HI> and <HI>Fortifications</HI> of the said Place.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P><HI>Licensed September</HI> the 25th. <HI>J. F.</HI> 1689.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<P>THis Town being now the <HI>Key,</HI> or <HI>Inlet</HI> to <HI>Dublin</HI> from the North, and as well for that reason, as for its Fortifications and natural strength, the most important Garrison in the whole Kingdom; the subduing of which gains <HI>Dublin,</HI> and consequently the best part of <HI>Ireland;</HI> on which account it has been the desire of the most Curious to know the Scituation and Strength of this impor∣tant Place. <HI>Tredagh</HI> (for its Antiquity) is the first Corporation in <HI>Ireland,</HI> before the Metroplis <HI>Dublin</HI> it self: It being an Ancient Prerogative, when the Major of <HI>Tredagh</HI> is Chosen, to dispatch a Horse∣man with all Expedition to the Lord Mayor and Court of Alderman then As∣sembled in the <HI>Tolsall,</HI> to acquaint them that the Mayor of <HI>Tredagh</HI> is Chosen, up∣on which immediately the Lord Mayor of <HI>Dublin</HI> is Sworn the same day.</P>
<P>It stands in the Province of <HI>Ʋlster</HI> in the County of <HI>Louth,</HI> on the River of <HI>Boyn,</HI> on the Mouth of the said River running full on the Sea, and within twenty Miles of <HI>Dublin</HI> by Land: The River <HI>Boyn</HI> di∣vides it as the <HI>Thames</HI> does <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Southwark,</HI> or as the <HI>Liffy</HI> does <HI>Ostman-Town</HI> and <HI>Dublin.</HI> It has over it a spacious Bridge with Nine Arches and Pillars, and a very Commodious Haven, in which Ships of the greatest Burthen may ly at Anchor; and Merchant-men of two or three hundred Tun sail up to the Key.</P>
<P>It took the name of <HI>Droghedah</HI> from the Bridge, which (to the wonder of the Natives) was built over the River. <HI>Drohed,</HI> in the Irish Language signifying a Bridge or Passage over the Water, since by the English, <HI>Dredagh,</HI> now generally <HI>Tredagh.</HI></P>
<P>It is a very Fair, Rich, and Popolous City, famous for all sorts of Commerce and Traffick, both by Sea and Land: This is evident by the richness of their Mer∣chants and Tradesmen, some of whom are valued Twenty, some Thirty, some Forty thousands pounds <HI>Sterlin.</HI></P>
<P>It is strongly Fortified as well by Art as Nature, having round it a strong Wall of 6 Foot, in some Places 7 Foot deep, with a Bastion at every Corner, besides several Terrets, or Towers, with small Cannons mounted on the said Towers, and two Demilunes, or Half-moons, on each side of the Town, on each of which, are planted Four Demiculverins: And two Plat-forms to the Water-side, with as many great Cannons.</P>
<P>Within the Circumference of this spa∣cious Wall it has Six Gates, <HI>viz.</HI>

<ITEM><HI>Dublin Gate.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>St. <HI>Johns Gate.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>West Gate.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Lawrance Gate.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Shop Gate.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Pillory Gate.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><HI>Dublin Gate</HI> is that which opens on <HI>Dub∣lin</HI> side, and enters the City that way which gives Denomination to the whole Street, at the end of which stands the <HI>Corn-market,</HI> besides the Streets which take their Denomination from the Gates, as,

<ITEM><HI>Dublin-street.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>St. <HI>Johns-street.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>West-street.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Lawrance-street.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Shop-street.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Pillory-street.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>There are several other very large and spacious Streets, as <HI>Dear-street,</HI> on the Left-hand at the Upper-end of the great Street, where stands the <HI>Tolsall,</HI> which is an Ancient and Curious Structure, the Seat of Judicature, and Place of their publick Assemblies.</P>
<P><HI>Bridges-street</HI> on the other-side the Bridge, upon which is built the Town-Jayl, called <HI>Guild hall,</HI> over the <HI>Boyn,</HI> be∣sides <HI>Alleys, Courts,</HI> and <HI>Lanes,</HI> innumer∣able.</P>
<P>To pass by <HI>Shop-street,</HI> which is the most eminent and remarkable for Mer∣chants, there are two Famous <HI>Keys, Savi∣ours</HI> and <HI>Merchants Key,</HI> upon which is built the <HI>Custom-house,</HI> the <HI>Burs,</HI> or <HI>Ex∣change.</HI></P>
<P>There were once as many large Churches as Streets, most of which were Demo∣lished in the time of the War: There yet remains the Famous Church of St. <HI>Peters,</HI> well beautified and kept in its Primative splendor; and St. <HI>Johns</HI> Church in St. <HI>Johns</HI> Street, which are the only two Churches endow'd, and a <HI>Chappel</HI> of Ease allowed to St. <HI>Peters,</HI> tell St. <HI>Lawrance</HI> Church be built. There is likewise a large <HI>Convention</HI> or Meeting-house on <HI>Sa∣viours Key.</HI> The <HI>Popish Chappel</HI> in <HI>West-street</HI> is pull'd down.</P>
<P>Besides what has been mention'd, there is yet one thing more remarkable called the <HI>Mill Mount,</HI> which being in the Cen∣tre of the Town, Commanding the Coun∣trey 6. or 7. Miles round every way, so that if this place were but well Built and Fortified, it would make the Town Inac∣cessable and almost Impregniable: The Neglect of this Fortification gave <HI>O. Crom∣well</HI> such speedy and easy Access into that Garrison, who reduced it in a weeks time, which the Wild Irish could hardly do in 3. Years.</P>
<P>This sucessfull Conqueror Marched out of <HI>Dublin</HI> with a Detatchment of 10000 Chosen Men the 30th. of <HI>August,</HI> 1649 with a Train of Artillery and 4. Whole, and 5. Demy Cannnons, Sir. <HI>George As∣cough</HI> with his Fleet blocking them up by sea, He came before <HI>Droghedah,</HI> on the 2d. of <HI>September.</HI> Where (without the Ceremonies of Drawing Lines, or Make∣ing Trenches, the Usual formalites of a Seige, he presently planted a strong Bat∣tery, which Quickly levelled the Steeple of a Church on the south-side of the Town, and a Tower by it, which Battery con∣triving (with the Fleet Blocking them up by sea) the 9th. of the same Month (which was within a weeks time) he be∣came master of the place, having taken it by storm, and put all to the sword, to the Number of above 3000. We doubt not but the same success will attend the no less Victorious General his Grace the D, of <HI>Schomberg</HI> in this present undertaking and thee Speedy Reducing of this Important place, which will prove for effectual an Inlett to the Subduing the whole Na∣tion.</P>
