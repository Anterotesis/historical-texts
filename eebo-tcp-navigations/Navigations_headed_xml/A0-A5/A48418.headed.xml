<HEAD>THE LIFE OF Admirall <HI>De Ruyter.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ARts in all ages have had their Chiefs and Grandecs, who by inventing of new, or improving of old devi∣ces, have been esteemed whilst a∣live, and renowned after death. And as their attempts were no o∣therwise to be valued but as the prevailing <HI>genius</HI> of their times weighed the uses of them so seve∣ral ages according to their predo∣minating measures, have placed,
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>or displaced their Artists in the <HI>Classis</HI> and Register of fame; which ought indeed to be the Royal Stan∣dard of such Worthies praise; though fond Posterity either over-affected with the advantages of their own, or not throughly in∣formed of the usefulness of elder-atchivements, do for the most part unjustly rank the Illustrious of former times in that order; that these have the precedency who seem most to favour the preroga∣tive of the present applauded pra∣ctices: when antiquated contri∣vances being tryed by a true sur∣vey of their profitableness when they Flourished, and the advances they gained beyond their respe∣ctive Predecessors, may appear to have made as high a rise above their antecedent hints, as our Great Guns excell the Roman bat∣tering Rams, or our roaring Trumpet-speaker, old bauling <HI>Sten∣tor,</HI> who now with the great He∣roes
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>of distant ages are sent again to School,</P>
<Q><HI>Ʋt pueris placeant &amp; declamatio fi∣ant.</HI></Q>
<P>The Masters of the Military Art as well as others, being obnoxious to this severe and partiall Judge∣ment, the contemporaries of great men have in all ages laboured to vindicate the honour of their He∣roes, by bringing to a fair tryal of their Countrey, the attainments and feats of such as they (the only competent Judges) thought wor∣thy to be listed in the Roll of Fame: and to crown them with such Verdant Bayes as nothing but a hotter season of newer attempts, and more taking discoveries, could ever blast or wither: And as care∣ful Navigators in coasting of new∣found Lands, or Ingenious Pain∣ters at the view of some rare and surprising beauty, fail not to make
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>some transient designes of the new objects; that either misfortune might not altogether deprive the world of them, or that the curio∣sity of others who should have bet∣ter opportunities might be raised to finish and compleat their in∣tended draughts: So in all times some have been, who have left to posterity the true and natural proportions and more discerna∣ble lineaments of the actions of famous men, which others who lived nearer them might fill up and imbellish with the several colours and shaddows of smaller occurrences. Now since our Age hath brought forth as many (if not more) Instances of this na∣ture, then any past, and rewar∣ded them with as suitable ho∣nours and titles, as the most tri∣umphant times whatsoever: I thought it not amisse at this time, when every little Ale and Coffee-house <HI>Virtuoso</HI> comes blustering
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>upon us from the press; to give the world a view of the Life and Death of the late Renowned Sea-General <HI>Michael Ad. de Ruyter</HI> Lieutenant-Admiral of the States of the United Netherlands, whose rare Endowments and memora∣ble Exploits have rendred him parallel to his most famed Com∣petitors, and the high pitch to which he grew from so low a root, more conspicuous then all: wherein if every little period of the several vicissitudes and chan∣ges of his fortune, be not so di∣stinctly and punctually handled, as might be expected from an ex∣act Diary, or <HI>Memoires</HI> (which is not the intent of this Treatise;) yet the more observable Circum∣stances of his whole life, partly from Relations of his own mouth, and partly from the authentick Te∣stimonies of Witnesses &amp; Records, shall be faithfully collected to the satisfaction of every Reader.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<P>DUring the Wars betwixt the Spaniards and Dutch in <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI> there served for some years the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> in quality of a private Trooper (a stranger by some judged a scottish man, so little known by his family, that his profession gave him his Sir∣name,) the happy Father of this brave man; who (being disban∣ded from, or displeased with that course of life;) with his wife, his only then childe <HI>Michael Ad. de Ruyter,</HI> born to him at <HI>Flushing</HI> in <HI>Zealand,</HI> (the subject of this present Discourse,) and serving∣maid, being the whole of his Fa∣mily, retired himself to a Coun∣trey-house at two miles distance from <HI>Bergen ap Zome,</HI> and there to the quieter employment of a husbandmans life: where by his industrous endeavours, with two horses, the greatest part of his substance, in the usuall labour
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>of that Countrey, he supplied the wants of his family with care and pains: but neither the low∣ness of the poor mans fortune (which commonly begets either contempt or pity) nor yet the priviledge of his person, as ha∣ving sometime served under the same Ensignes; could secure him or his beasts from the vio∣lence of licentious Souldiers: his two horses are taken from him by force; and carried to the Dutch Camp in <HI>Flanders,</HI> by some of the Troopers of that Ar∣my: this loss was too considera∣ble to be neglected by him, who thereby saw himself and family utterly ruined: He therefore ha∣stens after them to the camp; but finding his addresses for justice fruitless, by the delays and neglect of the Officers, and being well ac∣quainted with the proceedings of loosly disciplined or ill-paid Ar∣mies, where the Commanders
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>either share in, or connive at the rapine of the Souldiers: he resol∣ved on a speedier and more effectu∣al way of reparation, by stealing from robbers what they had un∣justly forced from him: And so having discovered where his hor∣ses were at grass, watching his opportunity, he secretly conveyed them away, and left them in a place somewhat remote from his own house, where he judged them farthest from danger, foreseeing (as indeed it happened) that these new Masters would not fail to look after the strays. The souldiers mis∣sing there booty, and concluding that the owner had them, returned in the night with a purpose to finde them at his house; but being by his provident care disappointed; in barbarous revenge they set on fire the poor single thatcht Cot∣house about the ears of the help∣less Inhabitants; In the horrour of this sudden surprise, whilst
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>the father, mother and servant save themselves, by breaking through the merciless flames, with that care of self-preserva∣tion, which is common to all creatures, and astonishment, usu∣al in such unexpected frights; the poor harmless childe the fu∣ture darling of <HI>Neptune,</HI> lay at the mercy of devouring <HI>Vulcan</HI> fast asleep in an upper room, swadled in his cradle; but the flames of Parental love towards an only childe, stronger than those of fire, soon scorcht the mothers heart with so great ap∣prehensions of the danger of her Son; that aided by that provi∣dence which saved the Children in the fiery furnace, with more than masculine courage, she threw her self into the house a∣gain, to save or die with that childe, by whose life and death fortune had decreed her honour: and having in her petticoat,
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>through smoke and flames, got into the upper Room, first threw the childe out of the window in∣to a sheet held by the father and maid to receive him, and after∣ward jump't out her self, saving from that little <HI>Troy</HI> her young <HI>Aeneas.</HI> So cross and unlucky are many times the beginnings of virtuous Men, and low the <HI>basis</HI> of Fames <HI>Pyramides,</HI> misery being commonly the first step to happiness, and a gloomy morning the portal of a fair day: Having thus happily avoided the Fury of this cruel Element, though stript of all, naked as truth it self, the disconsolate Fa∣ther in this so great uncertainty, finding no other hopes of relief but the Charity of the Merciful, betook himself with his wretch∣ed Family to <HI>Bergen ap Zome</HI> the next Town of Note, where arri∣ving early in the morning, he presented to his compassionate
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>Countreymen a lamentable spe∣ctacle of his new disaster:</P>
<P>The commendable care of that Countrey in providing for the Necessities of the indigent, either by maintaining of the infirm and impotent, or by imploying the stronger and those that are able, to work: afforded means for the poor man to subsist and feed his family; untill his young son being grown up to the state of a boy, able to do somewhat for himself, was placed in the rope∣ground of the Heer <HI>Lampson</HI> in <HI>Flushing,</HI> a considerable Mer∣chant; who had a Manufactory of Ropes there: The poor childe complying with the condition which he could not alter, with several other boys of his own rank and age, dilligently follow∣ed, his business in spinning of rope-yarn, and other drudgeries of that vocation to the content of his Overseers; until some time
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>after, the Heer <HI>Lampson</HI> himself coming into the rope-ground, and eying the lad; his fancy suggested to him (observing the features and carriage of the boy) the unsuitableness of that trade to the <HI>genius</HI> of the lad: and finding upon examination the forwardness of his wit, and con∣fident readiness in his answers, and his willingness to leave that course, and to serve him in some other capacity; he released him from that slavery, and sent him to school; where in a short time he gave such pregnant proofs of his parts and industry, that his Master finding his pro∣ficiency ripe for employment, prudently at first intrusted him with the charge of keeping of the accounts of his family-expen∣ces, that so he might the bet∣ter have a tryal of the youths abilities, and prevent the er∣rours, into which higher ad∣vancement
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>and distance of place often misleads unexperienced be∣ginners; imitating herein the example of Falconers, who use first to call their hawks to their fists with a guard, before they venture them at large to the lure: In this office he carried himself with so great fidelity and discretion, and thereby gained so great esteem from his Master; that he advanced him to be his book-keeper, and to the management of his Mer∣chant-affairs: wherein being likewise much satisfied with his skill and diligence; he pitched upon him as a person every way qualified for a Factor in his trade in <HI>Ireland,</HI> which consisted in but∣ter, herrings, tallow and hides: and accordingly sent him to <HI>Dublin;</HI> There he lived seven years under the inspection of Mr <HI>Cremor,</HI> Mr <HI>Vanhorn,</HI> Mr <HI>Wi∣born,</HI> and some others of his
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>Masters Correspondents; during which space, besides his attain∣ing of the English Tongue (ve∣ry necessary to him who was af∣terward to treat so often with the English in their own Lan∣guage) he gave so great proofs of his dexterity in the conduct of affairs of Trading, and of his faithfulness to his trust, and thereby so much content to his Master and Correspondents; that by them he was sent into the <HI>Streights,</HI> to negotiate as <HI>Supercargo</HI> of their Concerns there. And whilst in his several Voyages from Port to Port in those parts, he successfully improved his traffick to the profit both of his Master and himself; being a na∣tural enemy to idleness, and an Unactive life, and totally averse from the lazy and bruitish re∣vellings of the most part of Sea∣men; he had leisure to rub up those few impressions and hints
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>of the Mathematicks, and parti∣cularly Navigation, which he had learned when a boy: where∣in by the ripeness of his wit, his constant pains and study, and the assistance of some Artists, in a short time he made such lau∣dable progress; that he not only became able to conduct any Ship himself, but obtained a great Name amongst Navigators. And having afterward made several Voyages into the <HI>Streights</HI> and <HI>Barbary,</HI> upon the account of the Heer <HI>Lampson</HI> his Master and Be∣nefactor, with constant good for∣tune and applause, he married a Widow, and setled himself in <HI>Flushing</HI> in <HI>Zealand.</HI></P>
<P>The many good services which he had performed to his Master, and the reputation gained in his Sea-expeditions, began to plain the way to his preferment: In the year 1650. the dayly dam∣mages received from the <HI>Corsairs</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="10"/>of <HI>Argiers,</HI> the enemies of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> being so sensible, that thereby the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Trade, of great advantage to that Nati∣on, was much obstructed: the States (for the security of their Merchants) resolved to send Convoys with their Ships: the Heer <HI>Lampson</HI> laying hold of this opportunity to serve his Coun∣trey, and at the same time to show his love and gratitude to his friend, by the cheapest, and yet most noble way of reward; so effectually recommended Mr <HI>De Ruyter</HI> to the <HI>States General,</HI> that he obtained for him a Com∣mission to be Captain of a Man of War appointed by them, as a Convoy for their Merchant-men in the <HI>Streights,</HI> those fatal Nar∣row Seas, the Hercules-pillars of his life and honour, where he began and ended his Sea-prefer∣ment; and gave the first and last proofs of his Conduct and Va∣lour.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="10"/>
<P>In this expedition he had the Occasion to lay the foundation of his future greatness, first, by rendring himself remarkable in his Command, and next in his Estate, the two usual handmaids of rising fortunes: for as by his Valour and Conduct in many successful Engagements with these Pirates, he procured the one, so by his lawful and honest endeavours, he missed not of the other. Insomuch that his Name being grown publick in <HI>Holland,</HI> by the dayly characters of those who had been obliged by his care and good offices; the States began to think him worthy of some higher rank.</P>
<P>The Occasion was not long wanting to his more prosperous fortune, For in <HI>anno</HI> 1652. the equal success of the two Neigh∣bouring Common-wealths of <HI>England</HI> (then too unhappily established) and the States of
<PB N="18" REF="11"/>the <HI>Ʋnited Netherlands</HI> more deep∣ly rooted; began to advance to the incompatible heighth of Su∣periority (which was as much as Supremacy) their pretensions on the Seas: And although their claims were as different as that of an old possessor from a new intruder; yet the younger Rival the <HI>Hollanders</HI> thinking their power not inferiour to the other, the <HI>English,</HI> who upon the ac∣count of long and uninterrup∣ted possession, demanded of them the usual submissions: resolved to dispute the right by force of Arms, and so broke forth a War; which for the eagerness of the parties, the frequency of engagements, and the undaun∣ted constancy of the adversaryes whilst it lasted; may justly take place of all which before that time enobled the Ocean. Now was Captain <HI>Michael Adr. De Ruyter</HI> (signalized for his good
<PB N="19" REF="11"/>services in the Mediterranean, and eyed by the States as a per∣son fit for greater action) called home: And whilst Old Admiral <HI>Van Trump</HI> (after the engage∣ment on the nineteenth of <HI>May,</HI> 1652. with General <HI>Blake</HI> off of <HI>Dover</HI>-rode, the first action of hostility in this war, where he was defeated with the loss of two Ships and many men) was equipping and preparing in <HI>Hol∣land</HI> his Fleet, and broom to sweep the Seas; <HI>De Ruyter</HI> with a squadron of Fifty Men of War was speeded out from <HI>Zealand,</HI> to Convoy the Merchant-men to the Westward out of danger; and to scowr the Seas of the English; who on that side rendred the Navigation unsafe: This great Fleet first appearing off of <HI>Bright Hamstead</HI> in <HI>Sussex,</HI> where they forced ashoar, and took several Barks, continued their course Westward by the back of
<PB N="20" REF="12"/>the <HI>Isle of Wight:</HI> Advice of this being brought to the pretended Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> Sir <HI>George Ayscue</HI> who then Commanded a Fleet of fourty Men of War in the West about <HI>Plymouth;</HI> was ordered to stretch over the Channel towards the Coast of <HI>France,</HI> to hinder, or at least dispute them their passage: this he accordingly obeying, on the sixth of <HI>August</HI> 1652. the two Fleets came in sight; and about four in the afternoon, to blows; and here continued a sharp Fight, bravely maintained on both sides, till separated by night, both lay by: But <HI>De Ruyters</HI> chief business being to secure his Merchant-men, and Sir <HI>George</HI> not thinking it conveni∣ent to renew the Engagement: he carried off his Fleet without loss of a Ship.</P>
<P>The States acquainted with his good Conduct in this First Ex∣pedition,
<PB N="21" REF="12"/>appointed him his sta∣tion in the mouth of the Chan∣nel, to stop and seize all English Ships homeward or outward∣bound: There he discharged an English Ship that he had taken, upon condition that the Master should acquaint Sir <HI>George Ayscue,</HI> that he stayed for him, and would be glad to see him: but Sir <HI>George</HI> knowing well the prudence and valour of the Commander, and the humour of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> not rash to run any apparent risk on∣ly for ostentation of bravery, his own Fleet being inferior in num∣ber; and having received no new Orders from his Masters; returned no answer: This brisk carriage won <HI>De Ruyter</HI> a singu∣lar reputation of gallantry and good conduct from the States-Ge∣neral, but in particular manner from the States of <HI>Zealand:</HI> In this station he continued cruising, till <HI>De Witt</HI> with another consi∣derable
<PB N="22" REF="13"/>Fleet from <HI>Holland</HI> joyn∣ed him, on the Twenty fourth of <HI>September;</HI> and having recei∣ved six Plate ships with their convoy whom they expected from <HI>Cadiz,</HI> they both together set sail homewards.</P>
<P>General <HI>Blake</HI> returning with the English Fleet from <HI>Plymouth</HI> towards the <HI>Downs,</HI> discovered the Dutch Fleet commanded by <HI>De Witt</HI> and <HI>De Ruyter</HI> riding at the back of the <HI>Goodwin-Sands,</HI> after that they had sent their charge into <HI>Holland; Blake</HI> resol∣ved to have engaged them, but the winde blowing hard hindred his attempt then untill afterward; the season being more favourable on the Twenty eighth of <HI>October,</HI> with three Squadrons of Ships he made up to them; but fin∣ding them so well protected by the Sands amongst which they rode, and having run aground the <HI>So∣veraign</HI> and <HI>Resolution,</HI> (which
<PB N="23" REF="13"/>were presently got off again) in his too rash approach with the great Ships, he was forced to de∣sist. <HI>De Witt</HI> and <HI>De Ruyter</HI> in the entry of a War being ashamed thus to be braved, voluntarily left their advantagious station, came forth and fought the Eng∣lish; but with so great loss, that notwithstanding all the cou∣rage and conduct employed by the two Admiralls during the action, they were forced to run, leaving many Ships burnt and sunk; and were pursued by the English within twelve Leagues, E. S. E. of the <HI>Maes,</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Holland;</HI> till with the remainder of the Fleet shattered and torn <HI>de Wit</HI> and <HI>de Ruyter</HI> got into <HI>Goree.</HI> The <HI>Hollanders</HI> im∣puted their ill successe in this Fight to the over-match of the English, and the cowardise of some of their Captains, who did not fight; but experience hath
<PB N="24" REF="14"/>since demonstrated, that the pru∣dent use which the cautious <HI>De Ruyter</HI> made of the misfortune, was never to forsake an advantagi∣ous station till a more advantagious opportunity of fighting offfered.</P>
<P>This Defeat spurr'd the <HI>Dutch</HI> on revenge: For on the Nine and twentieth of <HI>November</HI> following, old <HI>Van Trump</HI> and Vice-Admiral <HI>De Ruyter</HI> with a Fleet of Eighty Men of War, and Ten Fire-ships put to Sea again, and finding Ge∣neral <HI>Blake</HI> at his station with a number far inferiour, not much exceeding fourty Sail, but with equal resolution to fight: <HI>Van Trump</HI> and <HI>De Ruyter</HI> made up towards him, and he not shrinking, there began a hot and bloudy combat, obstinatly maintained for some time; but the disparity of num∣ber being unreasonably great, the English were routed, and the Garland-Frygat taken: In this Fight <HI>De Ruyter</HI> sustained much
<PB N="25" REF="14"/>dammage in his Ship, and lost many men, having been observed as forward in the Engagement as any, and as long in action.</P>
<P>The Dutch in the mean time kept the Seas, cruising in the Channel off of the <HI>Isle of Wight,</HI> whilst <HI>Blake</HI> impatient of long delay, having with great expedi∣tion fitted and reinforced his Fleet: the Eight of <HI>February</HI> 1653. set sail from <HI>Quinborough</HI> with sixty Men of War, intending to joyn twenty more at <HI>Portsmouth.</HI> These keen Competitors seemed only to withdraw a little, and take breath, that with greater force, and fury, they might renew their onset, as it proved shortly after: For <HI>Van Trump</HI> be∣ing sailed according to his Or∣ders to the Westward, to attend and Convoy a Numerous and Rich Fleet of Merchant-men, coming from the <HI>Streights,</HI> and other Southern parts; and on
<PB N="26" REF="15"/>the eleventh of <HI>February</HI> General <HI>Blake</HI> having joyned the <HI>Portsmouth</HI> Fleet at <HI>Beachy-head,</HI> he sailed the height of <HI>Portland,</HI> and there lay cross the <HI>Channel,</HI> expecting the coming of the <HI>Dutch:</HI> On the Eighteenth, about break of day, were discovered <HI>Van Trump</HI> and <HI>De Ruyter</HI> with their Fleet, to the number of between three and four hundred Sail, Men of War and Merchant-men: The English stoutly bore up and en∣gaged them, and were with no less valour received by the Dutch; but <HI>Blake</HI> resolving to make them sensible, that it was not their courage, but number, which had given the English the former ruffle; pressed them with such irresistable courage and force, that they were forced to run, and with great loss to get home; yet the conduct and cou∣rage of <HI>Van Trump</HI> and <HI>De Ruy∣ter</HI> was so remarkable in bringing
<PB N="27" REF="15"/>off the Merchant-men; that both merited and received special and publick thanks from the States.</P>
<P>By this time the Hollanders having by fresh experience lear∣ned the danger of tempting the Lion even in his den, resolved no more to hazard their Mer∣chant-men in the Channel; but judged the farthest way about to be the nearest way home; and so having ordered them to re∣turn by the back of <HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>Scotland;</HI> Leiutenant Admiral <HI>Van Trump</HI> and Vice-Admiral <HI>De Ruyter</HI> were set out from the <HI>Texel</HI> with Eighty Men of War to meet and Convoy a Fleet of Two hundred Sail of Merchant∣men coming that way from <HI>France:</HI> which being successful∣ly effected without interruption from the English then in the <HI>Downs,</HI> they kept out at sea expe∣cting their Enemies. The English then being commanded by a tri∣umvirate
<PB N="28" REF="16"/>of Generals of equal and joynt authority, <HI>Blake, Dean,</HI> and <HI>Monck,</HI> on the second of <HI>Iune,</HI> came in sight of the Dutch Fleet, and about eleven or twelve of the Clock engaged them. It was fought till night with much blood and fierce reso∣lution; but the English accusto∣med to victory, having lost <HI>Dean,</HI> one of their Generals, ply∣ed them so warmly, that they thought it safest to fly to <HI>Blanck∣enburgh;</HI> General <HI>Monck</HI> pursu∣ing them at the heels to seven fathom water. During the whole fight Vice-Admiral <HI>De Ruyter</HI> and Rear-Admiral <HI>Lawson</HI> on the English side, having singled themselves out, fought singly with such courage and emulati∣on as might be expected from two Commanders of so much Fame and Honour.</P>
<P>Hardly can there be shown greater struglings for Victory,
<PB N="29" REF="16"/>or stiffer ambition for greatness, than appeared in the Dutch, du∣ring all this War; who the more they were beaten (like balls against a wall) the sooner they rebounded: About the lat∣ter end of <HI>Iuly, Van Trump</HI> and <HI>De Ruyter</HI> from <HI>Zealand,</HI> and <HI>De Witt</HI> from <HI>Holland,</HI> set out again to sea; and being joyned, made up a Fleet of Ninety Sail of Men of War, and ten Fireships. Gene∣ral <HI>Monck</HI> with a Fleet far less in number being then abroad, the twenty nineth of <HI>Iuly</HI> towards night came up with them: but the Master of his Ship fearing the enemies Fireships, and advi∣sing him not to venture an En∣gagement, the General in anger, and in terms more of a stout Commander, than expert Sea∣man; bid him <HI>Turn again:</HI> And so with prodigious courage gave them their last, and most fatal defeat, in these their Wars with
<PB N="30" REF="17"/>the Commonwealth of <HI>England:</HI> wherein besides the loss of Twenty six Men of War, their Admiral <HI>Van Trump</HI> ended his daies; and of all the Flagships of their Fleet only that of <HI>De Ruy∣ter</HI> had the fortune to come into Port with the Flag standing.</P>
<P>After the death of <HI>Van Trump, Opdam</HI> was made Admiral in his place, a Land-Souldier and Offi∣cer of Horse; the States proba∣bly thinking, that by matching the quality of their Admiral with that of the English General <HI>Monck;</HI> they might equal their fortune: <HI>De Witt</HI> Vice-Admiral, and <HI>De Ruyter</HI> Rear-Admiral of <HI>Holland.</HI> But whilst the <HI>Dutch</HI> are fitting for new action, though with somewhat slower procedure than formerly, their heat and strength being much, cooled and abated; there starts up in <HI>England</HI> a new Statholder; <HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI> General of the
<PB N="31" REF="17"/>Army made Protector of the Common-wealth. This New Usurper, knowing that his authority being forced, violent, and against nature, needed grea∣ter confirmation and support, than he could expect from the free and voluntary obedience of an overpowered people: and the States general finding them∣selves much weakened by the past War, they both understood one another so well, and their several interests, that about the latter end of <HI>January</HI> 1653/4. a peace was concluded betwixt them, which at that time stopt the troubled humours, but remo∣ved not the causes of relapses.</P>
<P>After this peace, <HI>De Ruyter</HI> transports himself with his Wife, Son <HI>Engell De Ruyter,</HI> two daughters, and the rest of his family, from <HI>Flushing,</HI> where he had formerly lived, to <HI>Am∣sterdam,</HI> as the place of his fu∣ture
<PB N="32" REF="18"/>residence, and more con∣spicuous stage of Honour: but here he had hardly warmed his new House, when the States found new business for him in the <HI>Old Streights.</HI> The Pirates of these Seas after their wonted manner so incommoded Navi∣gation in these parts, that <HI>De Ruyter</HI> with a Squadron of Men of War in <HI>anno</HI> 1654. was sent by the States to suppress and tame their insolency: In his Voyage thither he friendly met with his ancient enemy <HI>Blake,</HI> who then was in the <HI>Streights</HI> with a Fleet of Ships upon the account of the Protector and Commonwealth of <HI>England;</HI> where they saluted each other, shook hands, and parted in very good terms; and <HI>De Ruyter</HI> continuing his course to <HI>Argiers;</HI> in a short time so humbled the <HI>Corsairs</HI> of that place, <HI>Tripoli</HI> and <HI>Tunnis,</HI> that he brought them to a peace,
<PB N="33" REF="18"/>though of short duration, and so with honour and applause re∣turned back again to <HI>Holland:</HI> where shortly after a greater field of honour was designed for him.</P>
<P>Men that would be great and rich by hook and by crook, by potching, and fishing where sometime they should not; first grow envious and pettish, and then angry and quarrelsome with their thriving Neighbours. In the year 1657. the Victorious Arms of <HI>Swedland</HI> had lodged themselves in the very heart of <HI>Poland,</HI> threatning danger if not ruine to that Kingdom. The States of <HI>Holland</HI> fearing lest the prosperous success of that Crown with which their friendship and correspondence was always doubtful and uncertain, might keep bread from their butter, and much damnifie their traffick in the Baltick Sea: perswaded
<PB N="34" REF="19"/>the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> their anci∣ent Allie, who had more reason then force, to break with <HI>Swed∣land,</HI> promising him all assist∣ance to regain from that King what he had wrested and de∣tained from him some years be∣fore: This instance of the States-General so prevailed with him, that he declared War against the King of <HI>Swedland,</HI> and invaded his Kingdomes; wherewith the <HI>Swede</HI> being allarmed, was for∣ced to leave <HI>Poland,</HI> and with all his forces return home against the <HI>Dane.</HI></P>
<P>The bad success which the <HI>Danes</HI> had in these Wars both by Sea and land, obliged the States of <HI>Holland</HI> to put a Fleet to Sea under the command of Admiral <HI>De Witt</HI> to assist them in the <HI>Sound;</HI> But his Fleet being by the <HI>Swedes</HI> there routed, the Admirals Ship the <HI>Bredrow</HI> sunk, and <HI>De Witt</HI> himself either killed or drowned:
<PB N="35" REF="19"/>a fresh Recruit was dispatched with Admiral <HI>Opdam</HI> to re-inforce their Fleet: <HI>Opdam</HI> arrived in the <HI>Sound,</HI> but finding himself too weak to encounter the enemy; was forced to secure himself and Fleet in <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> then blockt up by the <HI>Swedes</HI> with a strait Siege, both by Sea and land: The King of <HI>Swedland</HI> in the mean time hear∣ing of greater preparations in <HI>Holland</HI> for a stronger Fleet to be sent under the command of <HI>De Ruyter,</HI> whose conduct and fortune was more apprehended then that of the others, ordered his Ministers in <HI>England</HI> vigorous∣ly to prosecute with the Usur∣per <HI>Oliver,</HI> their instances for as∣sistance: This they so accomplish∣ed, that the intended succours (his death preventing) were by him recommended to the care of his Son <HI>Richard,</HI> the short Successour to his Usurped autho∣rity: <HI>Richard</HI> with the consent
<PB N="36" REF="20"/>of the then pretended Parliament, for that end, and for the security of the English Trade in the <HI>Bal∣tick,</HI> in the beginning of the year 1659. sent the brave General <HI>Mon∣tague,</HI> afterward Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> with fourty Men of Warr well mann'd, and some Fire-ships, who on the twenty seventh of <HI>April,</HI> arrived in the <HI>Sound:</HI> Shortly af∣ter came also <HI>De Ruyter</HI> with a strong Fleet from <HI>Holland,</HI> whose presence relieved <HI>Copenhagen</HI> and <HI>Opdams</HI> Fleet; For the <HI>Swedes</HI> not being able alone to come to a try∣all, the English refusing to fight until they were satisfied in some demands, and the news of the al∣teration of Government in <HI>Eng∣land (Richard</HI> the Protector being turned out of power) superve∣ning at the same instant, which called them home again, relieved the Besieged, and hindred a new rupture betwixt the <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> which in all probabi∣lity
<PB N="37" REF="20"/>must have immediately en∣sued.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Denmark</HI> by this timely succour revived, and the English Fleet returned to <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Opdam</HI> to <HI>Holland; De Ruyter</HI> with the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Danish</HI> Fleet continued Master of the Seas, ready for some Land-undertaking, since the <HI>Swedes</HI> (then too weak) declined all engaging at Sea: The Island of <HI>Funnen</HI> in the <HI>Baltick Sea,</HI> of the ancient inheritance of the <HI>Danes,</HI> but then in the possession of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> being taken by them some years before, offered a neces∣sary occasion: And for that pur∣pose General <HI>Schaack,</HI> with seven thousand men, being put aboard of the Fleet at <HI>Kiel,</HI> were by <HI>De Ruyter</HI> conducted; and on the last of <HI>October</HI> landed at <HI>Kortemundor,</HI> in the Island of <HI>Funnen:</HI> The <HI>Swedes</HI> made brave resistance; but <HI>De Ruyter</HI> diverting their Forces, with alarming at the same time
<PB N="38" REF="21"/>other parts of the Island, and with a stout example, he him∣self standing in the water, encou∣raging the Souldiers to land, whom in great numbers they poured ashoar; The <HI>Swedes</HI> were overthrown with great losse, and the Island regained to the <HI>Danes.</HI></P>
<P>This brave action of <HI>De Ruyter</HI> gained him more reputation from his Countrey, and honour from his masters, then all which be∣fore that time he had atchieved, and so endeared him to the fa∣vour and esteem of the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> that he honoured him with the highest Order of Knight∣hood of that Kingdom, being that of the Elephant; and presented him with a Chain and Meddal of Gold, which afterward he wore; and having remained there among the <HI>Swedes,</HI> untill the Peace between the <HI>Danes</HI> and them in <HI>May.</HI> 1660. was ratified,
<PB N="39" REF="21"/>he with great applause returned with his Fleet home.</P>
<P>The War betwixt the <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Swedes</HI> ended, and <HI>De Ruy∣ter</HI> with his Fleet safely returned into <HI>Holland,</HI> new losses from the Pirates of <HI>Argiers, Tripoli,</HI> and <HI>Tunis,</HI> called afresh to the States for remedy: The vigilant and successful <HI>De Ruyter</HI> was by the States designed for that charge; whose good services (on the like occasion) even in the infan∣cy of his Sea-command had been remarkable in those Seas; and is therefore dispatcht with a Squadron of Ships into the <HI>Streights;</HI> where he kept rang∣ing with his Fleet, pursuing and pressing those <HI>Gorsairs</HI> with so great care and success, that the benefit of his constant pains and valour became sensible to all the Merchants who traded there; whereby he confirmed to himself that fame and reputation which
<PB N="40" REF="22"/>he had heretofore so justly meri∣ted, until matters of greater con∣cern called him thence, upon the occasion following.</P>
<P>After the wonderfull and long-wished-for re-establishment of his Majesty, the King of <HI>Great Brittain,</HI> in the Throne of his Ancestors, from which by the madness of his Subjects he had been long banished; the States of the United Provinces overgrown with the wealth and prosperity of many years peace, the ordinary promoters of am∣bition; being conscious to them∣selves, that their carriage to∣wards their Neighbors, especi∣ally the English, however cloak∣ed, could not but breed such jealousies as must in time break forth into open enmity; and perceiving his Majesty of <HI>Great Brittain</HI> already so dissatisfied with their disguised practises, as could not but of necessty produce
<PB N="41" REF="22"/>a War, resolved to bring it to a tryall as soon as possibly they could, by giving the first occasi∣on of rupture, under the pretext of being provok'd by injuries re∣ceived upon the Coast of <HI>Guiny,</HI> and elsewhere; Hereupon they Ordered Admiral <HI>De Ruyter</HI> with a squardron of thirteen Men of War then at <HI>Gibraltor</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> to make sail for the Coast of <HI>Gui∣ny,</HI> and to set upon the English there; This he so effectually per∣formed, that in a short time he destroyed most of their Factories, took <HI>Cormanteen</HI> Castle with other places, severall Ships and goods belonging to the English.</P>
<P>That action so incensed his Ma∣jesty of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> that war was thereupon in <HI>anno</HI> 1664. publick∣ly proclaimed against the States General of the United Provinces, impowering all his Majesties Sub∣jects, to use against them their subjects and people, all acts of
<PB N="42" REF="23"/>hostility; but whilst this was do∣ing at home, <HI>De Ruyter</HI> diligent in the pursuance of his Com∣mission abroad, attempted the burning of the English Ships at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> but in vain; and from thence sailing to <HI>New-found land,</HI> took several Merchants Ships, stript the men, and left them without provisions; an act un∣worthy the name of so brave a man: Thus whilst <HI>Opdam</HI> Ad∣mirall of the Dutch Fleet in <HI>June</HI> 1665, having engaged his Royall Highness the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> was in fire and smoak hurried out of this world, and his Fleet beat home with great loss of Ships and men; <HI>De Ray∣ter</HI> remained at Sea, annoying the Ships and Foreign Plantati∣ons of the English: But <HI>Opdams</HI> death rendred his presence at home absolutely necessary, his experience and success in War being so well known to all, that
<PB N="43" REF="23"/>the universal voice of the peo∣ple daily called his Name, whom (according to the interest and power they pretend to upon the Seas) they adopted, and inti∣tled, <HI>Son of Neptune:</HI> Advice was therefore sent to him, that he should with his Fleet hasten home with all expedition; which he obeying, slily slipt by the English Fleet wrapt in mist, as men with their cloaks about their mouths shun the company of those whom they are not willing to meet; And on the last of <HI>July</HI> 1665. safely arrived in the <HI>Emmes:</HI> his arrival was congratulated by the States, and he thereupon made Admiral, but with authority not so abso∣lute, but that he was subordi∣nate to the Triumvirate of <HI>De Witt, Huygens</HI> and <HI>Bureel;</HI> who according to a new Model, had the superintendency of the Na∣vall affairs. He was no sooner
<PB N="44" REF="24"/>installed in his new Command, but <HI>August</HI> 13. with a Fleet of Ninety Sail of Men of War, he was Ordered out from the <HI>Texel,</HI> to secure and convoy home the <HI>East-India</HI> Fleet, and many other rich Merchant-men, which stopt at <HI>Bergen</HI> for fear of the English Fleet then at Sea under the Command of the Earl of <HI>Sand∣wich;</HI> and who had been put in great alarm by the brave, but fruitless attempt of Sir <HI>Tho∣mas Tiddyman,</HI> who was sent out to have seized them in their harbour; In his going he met not with the English Fleet, but in his return was discovered and attacqued by the Earl of <HI>Sand∣wich,</HI> who finding himself too weak, his charge great, and the windes very high, with a run∣ning Fight he made the best of his way, and with the loss of two great <HI>East-India</HI> Ships, some other Merchant-men, and five
<PB N="45" REF="24"/>Men of War, he brought his Fleet into the West <HI>Emmes.</HI></P>
<P>Before his Arrival by a Ma∣ster of a Ship which he had met at Sea, he sent a challenge to Major <HI>Holmes</HI> to meet him there; that seeing they two had been the first Adventurers in the War, they might try the success of the publick quarrel, as far as their particular prowess and fortune could incline it: The Challenge was as nobly ac∣cepted by the Major, as ge∣nerously and gallantly sent by <HI>De Ruyter;</HI> and the King of <HI>England</HI> to encourage the under∣taking, Knighted Major <HI>Holmes,</HI> and assigned him a stately New Ship then built at <HI>Deptford</HI> which he purposely called the <HI>Defiance:</HI> but this combat was diverted by other intervening accidents.</P>
<P>In <HI>May</HI> 1666. <HI>De Ruyter</HI> with his Fleet being at Sea, His Ma∣jesty of <HI>Great Britain</HI> set out a
<PB N="46" REF="25"/>well appointed and great Fleet, under the joint Command of his Highness Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> and his Grace the Duke of <HI>Albe∣marle,</HI> renowned for his valour and success in the former War against the Dutch, and now advanced to that title; for the great and memorable Services performed to the King: but a false rumour of the French be∣ing at Sea, occasioned the divi∣ding of that Fleet: for Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> with the white Squa∣dron, being ordered to make for the coast of <HI>France,</HI> to hin∣der the conjunction of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> who before the French came to Sea, the Duke of <HI>Albemarle</HI> was left, with about fifty Sail of Men of War, to wait on the Dutch: The boundless courage of that Duke, a dispiser of danger, led him to a gallant, but rash attempt, upon <HI>De Ruyter</HI> and his Fleet,
<PB N="47" REF="25"/>who then riding at anchor off of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> with a number of Ships far exceeding the English; was upon Fryday the first of <HI>June</HI> so unexpectedly assaulted by them, the winde blowing high; that many of his Ships were fain to cut their cables in haste to put themselves in order of fighting: This was indeed a bloody and terrible engage∣ment, which continued with matchless fury and resolution on both sides, till Sunday in the Evening; when the English Fleet being much torn, and the Generals own Ship disabled; (the disproportion of number, and the enemies Fleet being to the Leeward, whereby they played their great guns, which the English could not, being to the weather, and the winde high; giving great advantage to the Dutch) they drew off, having lost the evening, before
<PB N="48" REF="26"/>the brave Ship the <HI>Prince,</HI> which being stranded, was burnt by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and Sir <HI>George Ayscue</HI> Commander made Prisoner: yet notwithstanding their great loss, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> upon notice given, and the noise of the guns then heard, having on Sunday in the Evening rejoyned the Fleet, and given the usuall proofs of his great and undaunted valour: both Generalls on Munday early in the morning, pursued the Dutch, who were almost out of sight, passed and repassed their Fleet several times: But <HI>De Ruy∣ter</HI> finding himself (notwithstan∣ding of the recruits received) so weakned, that his longer continuance in action might have produced the effects rather of a vain glorious Bravo, then of a prudent circumspect General, and good Countrey-man; ha∣ving given wonderfull marks of his carriage and conduct, made
<PB N="49" REF="26"/>made what haste he could to se∣cure his Fleet: This was the first encounter that <HI>De Ruyter</HI> as Com∣mander in chief had with the English in these Wars; the vic∣tory of which was equally cele∣brated in both Nations, but who∣ever had the better, it is certain, both sustained very great losses.</P>
<P>The pretensions to victory in this last Fngagement owned mu∣tually by both parties, occasioned their hastening out again with all speed to Sea, either to make good the old, or to gain a new title; and so in <HI>Iuly</HI> both Fleets were abroad; The <HI>English</HI> commanded by <HI>Albemarle,</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> by <HI>De Ruyter;</HI> And on S. <HI>Iames's</HI> day about nine in the morning met and fell to blows again. <HI>De Ruy∣ter</HI> with his Fleet for some con∣siderable time made a brisk and a stout resistance, but the English jealous of their honour which seemed to suffer by the <HI>Dutch</HI> ar∣rogating
<PB N="50" REF="27"/>to themselves the Victo∣ry in the former Engagement, plyed them so fiercely, that pro∣vident <HI>De Ruyter</HI> finding his fleet in a bad condition, according to his saving principles, of making the best of an ill bargain, began to give way, and was so closely pursued by the <HI>English</HI> Red and White Squadrons (whilest <HI>Van Trump</HI> couragiously entertained the Blew) that <HI>De Ruyters</HI> own Ship was much shattered, and himself in all probability, if the English great ships could have got up with him, in danger of being taken, and two squadrons of his Fleet utterly destroyed: In this fight, on the <HI>English</HI> side, were only three Captains killed, the <HI>Resolution</HI> burnt, and not ma∣ny above three hundred men kil∣led and wounded: On the <HI>Dutch</HI> side (according to the general computation of that time) above four thousand men killed, three
<PB N="51" REF="27"/>hundred common Sea-men wounded, and many Captains slain, amongst which <HI>Everson</HI> Admiral of <HI>Zeland, Dirickhids</HI> Ad∣miral of <HI>Friesland,</HI> the Vice-Ad∣miral of <HI>Friesland,</HI> and Rear-Ad∣miral <HI>Van Saen,</HI> and the number of their fleet so impaired, that of above an hundred Ships there re∣turned but eighty into harbour. The <HI>Dutch</HI> who hitherto still boast∣ed of Victory, gave now sensible signs of the English having the better, by leaving their harbours and rodes undefended; so that Sir <HI>Robert Holmes</HI> shortly after this fight, sails into the <HI>Ulie,</HI> and with one fifth-rate Frigate, some Ketch∣es and fireships, there burnt an hundred and sixty sail of <HI>Dutch</HI> Vessels.</P>
<P>But neither was this nor the last blow so fatall as to keep the <HI>Dutch</HI> from Sea, for about the end of <HI>August</HI> Admiral <HI>De Ruyter</HI> ap∣pears again with a stronger fleet
<PB N="52" REF="28"/>then before, stretching along the back of the <HI>Goodwin</HI> sands, for the <HI>French</HI>-coast, with designe to have joyned the Duke of <HI>Beaufort,</HI> who with about forty sail of <HI>French</HI> ships lay at <HI>Rochel</HI> ready to come to their assistance: The English fleet having advice, made after them with such diligence, that they were forced to stand in for <HI>Bulloign</HI>-road, and there very nar∣rowly escaped a new Engagement, by reason of the weather, which growing extremely tempestuous, constrained the English to bear away for <HI>S. Hellens Bay,</HI> the place of rendevouz, and the most pro∣per station to hinder the conjun∣ction of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch:</HI> In the mean while the <HI>Ruby</HI> a <HI>French</HI>-ship of fifty four guns, com∣manded by <HI>Monsieur le Roche</HI> se∣parated by foul weather from the rest of the fleet, mistaking the enemies white-flag for their own, fell in amongst the English, and
<PB N="53" REF="28"/>after some stout resistance, was taken, and the Captain made Pri∣soner, but in complement to his valour, was afterward dismissed: And now <HI>De Ruyter</HI> falling sick, was forced to return to <HI>Amster∣dam,</HI> leaving the care and charge of the <HI>Dutch</HI> fleet to <HI>Van Ness;</HI> But the States finding the season far spent, and the weather stormy and tempestuous, commanded their fleet home.</P>
<P>After that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet was returned into harbour, and <HI>De Ruyter</HI> recovered of his sickness, some grudgings and animosities arisen betwixt him and <HI>Van Trump</HI> during the late actions, pro∣ceeding partly (as it was concei∣ved) from the byass of their differ∣ing factions, the former being a de∣clared re-publican, and the latter a favourer of the interest of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who was not then advanced to the dignity of Stat-holder;) broke forth in∣to
<PB N="54" REF="29"/>such open debate, that they mutually accused and blamed each other, for the ill success and miscarriages of the past Summers actions; but Admiral <HI>De Ruyter</HI> highly esteemed by the States for his Valour, prudence and fingular conduct, and sup∣ported by the favour of the lea∣ding Party, so far prevailed with his Masters, that several Sea-Commanders were put to death for cowardise, and himself con∣firmed with greater power and authority then before.</P>
<P>About the end of this year 1666. the Dutch being weary of the vast expences, and weakned by the great losses of the war, and the English much disheart∣ned by the burning of the City of <HI>London,</HI> which happened in <HI>September;</HI> both seemed inclina∣nable to an accomodation; and overtures of peace thereupon be∣gan to be set on foot on either
<PB N="55" REF="29"/>side; which seemed to some who thought themselves wise very hopeful.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the Spring <HI>De Ruyter</HI> was again speeded out to Sea, and in <HI>April</HI> 1667, made an attempt with a good Fleet upon Brunt-Island, a Town in the Scottish firth, intending to have landed and spoyled the Countrey; but by the vigilant care, and conduct of the Earl of <HI>Rothoes,</HI> Chancellour of that Kingdom, with the Trained Bands of the Countrey, he was bravely repulsed with loss.</P>
<P>After this, <HI>De Ruyter</HI> to amuse the English (who in a small Fleet were at sea) sent off a detach∣ment of twenty five sail of ships to cruise to the Northward, who on the third of <HI>June</HI> falling in with Nineteen Sail of English Frigats off of <HI>Hull,</HI> began a furi∣ous and bloudy conflict, which was so stoutly and obstinately
<PB N="56" REF="30"/>maintained on both sides, that from twenty five the <HI>Dutch</HI> were reduc't to fourteen sail, and the <HI>English</HI> from nineteen to fifteen.</P>
<P>Shortly after he made an at∣tempt upon some Neighbouring parts of <HI>Harwich,</HI> having put a∣shoar three thousand men near <HI>Felston-cliff,</HI> and commanded two thousand of them to make an as∣sault upon <HI>Langward-Fort,</HI> which was twice essayed, the first last∣ing about three quarters of an hour, and the other one quarter; but at last with the losse of an hun∣dred men, they were forced to retreat in so much haste and dis∣order, that they left behinde them all their ladders: whilest these a∣ctions continued at <HI>Langward-fort,</HI> a party of twelve hundred <HI>Dutch</HI> being posted at the cliff their lan∣ding-place, to secure and make good their retreat, were attack∣ed by the Trained Bands of the Countrey under the Command of
<PB N="57" REF="30"/>the Earl of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> being supplied with fresh recruits from the Fleet, a very smart skir∣mish continued betwixt them till ten of the night; but the <HI>English</HI> horse then coming in sight, the <HI>Dutch</HI> thought it safest to quit the Land, and so as soon as their boats were afloat, in great haste they embarqued, and returned to their Fleet.</P>
<P>The day following this defeat at <HI>Langward-Fort, de Ruyter</HI> with the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet was pursued by Sir <HI>Edward Spragg</HI> and Sir <HI>Joseph Jordan</HI> with about twenty sail of small Frigats; but whether <HI>De Ruyter</HI> finding his Orders limited, or for the reasons above-hinted, notwithstanding he had a much stronger Fleet, kept at distance, and carefully avoided engage∣ment; taking his course through the channell for the Western parts of <HI>England:</HI> In his passage he ap∣peared before <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> but
<PB N="58" REF="31"/>knowing the strength of the place, and finding the Countrey in arms, he only shewed himself there, and so continued his voyage to the Western coasts.</P>
<P>In <HI>Devonshire</HI> he endeavoured to have landed some men at <HI>Wen∣bury,</HI> but the Militia of the Coun∣trey being ready to receive them, so warmly saluted them with some Volleys of small shot, that they were forced with all speed to betake themselves back again to their ships. The Admiral de∣spairing to effect any thing here by force, sent off a boat with a white flag, desiring leave to come ashoar to buy fresh provisions, but it was denied him by the Gen∣tlemen and Officers that com∣manded there; alledging that no such permission could be granted without the consent and autho∣rity of the Commander in chief, who then was absent: <HI>De Ruyter</HI> in this manner disappointed of
<PB N="59" REF="31"/>his intent at <HI>Wenbury,</HI> came with his whole Fleet before <HI>Couland</HI> in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and having anchored within musket shot of the shoar; sent off twelve boats full of men with designe of landing, whilst he in the mean time played on the land with his great guns from aboard: but the Foot of the Countrey, that were posted there, purposely to oppose their lan∣ding, charged them so briskly, that they were forced to put off again without effecting an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thing.</P>
<P>By this time <HI>De Ruyter</HI> being informed from <HI>Holland</HI> of the progress of the Treaty of Peace, which now was in a tendency to a speedy conclusion, not willing with new hostilities to retard that which was so heartily desired by both parties; relented a little in the ardour of his proceedings, and began to heal the wounds which he had formerly made, by
<PB N="60" REF="32"/>prudent application of the poli∣tick plaisters of necessity and ig∣norance; excusing some hostili∣ties, as thereto enjoyned by his Commission, and others as com∣mitted without his Order: And to that purpose sent off two of∣ficers with a flag of truce, who being brought before Sir <HI>Jonathan Trelawny,</HI> who commanded in chief under the Earl of <HI>Bath</HI> in these parts, and having made the complement and apologies of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dmiral, desired in his name a conference with some English aboard, for whose safe coming and returning, he was ready to engage the faith of the Seven Provinces. Sir <HI>Jonathan</HI> having herewith advised the Earl of <HI>Bath,</HI> by his Order <HI>De Ruyter</HI> was visited aboard of his own Ship, by the same Sir <HI>Jonathan Trelawny,</HI> Major <HI>Sparks,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Windham.</HI> The Admiral upon their approach courteously came
<PB N="61" REF="32"/>over his Ships-side, met, and re∣ceived them in their boat, where after mutuall salutations, having renewed the Apologies formerly made by his messengers; he in∣vited them aboard, received them with a salute of Ordinance, and entertained them with the Chief Officers of his Fleet at a mag∣nificent dinner in the great Cabbin: During which he gave honourable demonstrations of love and esteem for their per∣sons, and frequently repeated the expressions of the great ho∣nour he had for his Majesty and Kingdom of <HI>England;</HI> and real and hearty wishes for a solid and permanent correspondence be∣twixt both Nations, lamenting the great damages and loss which acorued to both by so ruinating a War. The English entertained his civilities with reciprocal returns of honour and kindeness, and having offered
<PB N="62" REF="33"/>him supplies of all necessary pro∣visions for his own Table, refu∣sing more untill the peace should be concluded; they took their leave, having been first assured by him, that no more hurt should be done to the Countrey whilst he remained on these Coasts. The Earl of <HI>Bath</HI> after∣ward presented him with such provisions and necessaries, as the Countrey and season of the year afforded; which he courteously received, and in signe of grati∣tude fired several guns, and so departed: but notwithstanding the promises of indemnity gi∣ven, after his departure from <HI>Plymouth,</HI> two of his Fleet, ad∣vancing toward <HI>Foy,</HI> for some time lay annoying and battering the harbour and shoar with great shot, till having received dammage in their hulls, and one of them having lost his main topmast, they desisted and went
<PB N="63" REF="33"/>off; whether this was by the Generals Order or not, is not known; there having been no enquiry ever made in the action, by reason of the peace that im∣mediatly followed; but it is be∣lieved that <HI>De Ruyter</HI> had no hand in it.</P>
<P>This long expected Peace con∣cluded at <HI>Breda</HI> the 21 of <HI>June,</HI> and at length the 14th of <HI>August</HI> 1667. ratified in <HI>England,</HI> rather by the exigency and necessity of the times, than the intire and full satisfaction of both parties, as appeared within few years af∣terward, gave respite to both Nations to breathe a little, and recruit their mutual past losses by industrious prosecuting their traffick, the hugg'd darling of both people: and to consider in cold blood what had been done amisse by either side, during the War, that from so seasonable a peace, they might pick the ne∣cessary
<PB N="64" REF="34"/>means of future reparati∣on. And now <HI>De Ruyter</HI> having safely reconducted his Fleet into harbour, was received by the States with thanks and honours suitable to his merit, and with the universal acclamations and applause of the Countrey; and was judged by all discreet men to have understood as well the measures of a General in that Common-wealth as any who∣soever, by his never giving way to the transports of vain∣glory, or rage in the heat of action, but by timely retreat or advantagious fighting; like the Roman <HI>Fabius Maximus, Cunctan∣do restituit rem.</HI></P>
<P>The States having now no more need of so eminent a Com∣mander at sea, the great and dreadfull War being over, but occasion still of a wise and pra∣ctised Statesman at home; ad∣mitted the <HI>Heer De Ruyter</HI> with
<PB N="65" REF="34"/>no less expectation into their Councils of difficult affairs, then they had formerly impowred him as General at sea: wherein he so answered their hopes; that during the four years peace, or rather cessation of arms betwixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> he gave so signal proofs of his prudence, that they were only fain to dis∣pence with his being at home; because they could not finde a Successour for him abroad which the businesse of the year 1672. ur∣gently required.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> King in <HI>anno</HI> 1671. with a considerable army came to <HI>Dunkirk</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> this progresse in a time of peace being accom∣panied with great preparations for War, gave apprehensions to all his Neighbours, but especial∣ly to the States of the United Provinces, who suspecting that his approach so near them, was to shew them the rod with
<PB N="66" REF="35"/>which he intended to chastise the rudeness and insolency which the States were said to have used towards his Majesty; began to arm, and make ready for their own defence. The King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> likewise seeing his po∣tent and most dangerous compe∣titors so busy and earnest at work, the designe of which was not as yet made publick; thought it time to look to the security of his subjects, and to put his Kingdoms out of danger of a surprise: and so at the same time (as by an influence of de∣stiny) most States of Christen∣dome seemed to prepare for war. The <HI>French</HI> who pretended to teach civility and good manners to those, who oftentimes are not willing to learn; thought the <HI>Dutch</HI> stood in need of some do∣cuments; and the partial and slow performances made by the States to the King of <HI>England,</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="35"/>and his subjects, of the Articles of their last Peace, and the quar∣rel of the <HI>Dutch</HI> fishing, ancient∣ly in the English seas, and more lately in their rivers, being neither so well adjusted, nor digested, as might stand with the honour and security of pub∣lick interest; the King herewith provoked, and by reviling Pamphlets against his Royal Person, joyned with the <HI>French</HI> King in a strict League of pur∣suing by arms their mutual pre∣tentions against the <HI>Dutch:</HI> And having first friendly demanded satisfaction of the past abuses by his Embassadour Sir <HI>George Down∣ing,</HI> his Majesty resolved to sum∣mon them to their duty by a more effectual Method.</P>
<P>On the thirteenth of <HI>January,</HI> two parties meeting, and the Dutch refusing to strike, there followed an engagement, and this first blow being thus given,
<PB N="68" REF="36"/>the King of Great Brittain pub∣lisheth his Declaration against the States of the United Pro∣vinces to this effect; That the dissatisfaction which his Majesty had from the carriage of the States General of the United Pro∣vinces towards him, for some years past, being such, that he could no longer without diminu∣tion of his own honour, dissem∣ble the indignation raised in him by a treatment too unsuitable to the great obligations which he and his Predecessours had so li∣berally heaped upon them; He was resolved to declare war a∣gainst them, forbidding all his Subjects to hold correspondence with them upon pain of death. This Declaration being with the usuall solemnities proclaimed in <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster,</HI> was se∣conded by the French King with actions previous to a rupture with that Crown also: he ha∣ving
<PB N="69" REF="36"/>laid great taxes and cu∣stomes upon all Dutch goods in his kingdom, and raised an im∣position of fifty <HI>per cent.</HI> upon salt, and other merchandises of <HI>France</HI> exported by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and up∣on all herrings, spices, and o∣ther goods imported into his do∣minions by them: prohibiting all his subjects to lade any bran∣dy aboard of any <HI>Holland</HI> or <HI>Dutch</HI> Vessells, and shortly after publickly, and in good earnest declared war.</P>
<P>The States of <HI>Holland</HI> foresee∣ing the storm which now began to break upon them, had so for∣tified themselves with the pow∣erfull alliances of <HI>Spain, Germany,</HI> and <HI>Denmark,</HI> that they seemed not unequally matched with their mighty enemies in so great a conjunction: so that in the year 1672. the greatest part of the States of Christendome be∣came involved in a bloody and
<PB N="70" REF="37"/>expensive War, which is not yet ended.</P>
<P>Matters thus advancing to∣ward action, the Dutch who were not behinde in their pre∣parations, but wanting a head, resolved to gratifie both Kings in the choice of their General, and so in a full Assembly of the States, the <HI>Prince of Orange</HI> is una∣nimously elected <HI>Generallissimo</HI> of all their Forces both by Sea and Land, for that years expedition, with promise to renew his au∣thority after expiration, during life: and <HI>Jan De Wit</HI> and the <HI>Rereward van Putten</HI> (the two unfortunate brothers that were afterward barbarously murthered in a tumult of the incensed rab∣ble at the <HI>Hague</HI>) with some others, appointed as Commissi∣oners to assist him: Under him <HI>De Ruyter</HI> was made Lieutenant-Admiral, whose power (not∣withstanding of his many tried
<PB N="71" REF="37"/>services, such is the fear of that State of an absolute authority) was stinted, having the <HI>Rereward Van Putten</HI> placed over him by the States as a check and curb: and considering the foreward∣ness of the English in their pre∣parations, was ordered with all expedition to hasten with his Fleet to Sea.</P>
<P>His Royall Highness the <HI>Duke of York,</HI> whose former success a∣gainst the Dutch had rendred his very name more terrible to that people, than the wonders of others, being at Sea with the English Fleet commanded by himself in chief, and the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> Admiral of the Blew; and having joyned the <HI>French</HI> with the white flag under the Command of the Count <HI>d'Estree,</HI> which all together made a for∣midable Navy, of about an hun∣dred and sixty sail, great and small: In <HI>May</HI> 1672. made to∣ward
<PB N="72" REF="38"/>the Coast of <HI>Holland,</HI> in search of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, then likewise at Sea, Commanded by <HI>De Ruyter, Van Ghent</HI> and <HI>Banckert;</HI> and having had seve∣ral views of the enemy, but no opportunity of fighting, which the cautious <HI>De Ruyter</HI> always a∣voided, according to his politick <HI>Maximes,</HI> without some appa∣rent advantage; but more espe∣cially at this juncture, when the States had so much lying at stake, not thinking it safe to quit his sands: his Highness with the whole Fleet returned to the Coast of <HI>England,</HI> and came to anchor in <HI>Southwold Bay.</HI></P>
<P><HI>De Ruyter</HI> (in the mean while) who was seldome out in his con∣jectures, concluding that his de∣clining of an Engagement would certainly be by the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> interpreted fear, and con∣sequently breed in them con∣tempt of their enemy, and there∣by
<PB N="73" REF="38"/>security, resolved to come up with them before he was ex∣pected: and being by his scouts advertised in what posture the English fleet lay, and having the winde favourable at E. N. E. weighed anchor from behinde his banks with his whole Fleet and on <HI>May</HI> 29th. by five of the clock in the morning came in sight of the Royall Fleet, so un∣expected, that several Ships were forced to cut their cables in dis∣order, to put themselves in po∣sture of fighting, and about eight in the morning fell in with them. The fight began be∣twixt the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> in the <HI>Royall James</HI> with the blew Squadron, and <HI>Van Ghent,</HI> whilst his Royall Highness in the <HI>Prince</HI> with the Red, engaged <HI>De Ruyter,</HI> and the Count <HI>De Estree</HI> with the French, and white Squadron, <HI>Banckert.</HI> The fight was terrible and bloody, especially between
<PB N="74" REF="39"/>the blew Squadron and <HI>Van Ghent,</HI> who in the beginning of the battel was shot to death. The brave Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> who was resolved to pawn his life for his honour, being engaged in the middle of the <HI>Dutch</HI> with a few ships; the <HI>Soveraign,</HI> and others of his Squadron, having stood off to gain the weather-gage, and the Duke in hot action with <HI>De Ruyter,</HI> overpowerd with a number of men of War and fire∣ships, and a hardy Dutch Cap∣tain <HI>Adrian Brackell,</HI> having laid him aboard athwart the hass; yet still continued the fight with such unshaken courage, that he sunk two of three of the fire∣ships that had grapled with him, and forced the Dutch Captain to call for quarter: but at last his ship being unhappily fired by a third Fireship, was burnt, and he himself with many persons of quality bravely, but unfortu∣nately
<PB N="75" REF="39"/>perished; to the grief of the King his Master, and un∣speakable regret of his Coun∣trey; having left to posterity an immortal proof, that Valour crowned with honour, does not shrink, but swells by its reward. <HI>Haddock</HI> his Captain though wounded, escaped by swimming, till he was taken up. This hap∣pened in the afternoon, when those ships of the blew-squa∣dron, that had stood off, having got the winde, bore down upon the Dutch, and assisted the Duke who pressed <HI>De Ruyter</HI> so straitly, that towards the even∣ing he gave way, and stood o∣ver for the Dutch Coast, and was pursued by the Duke all night. In this Engagement be∣sides the losse of the Noble Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> and his ship, the <HI>Henry</HI> and <HI>Royall Catherine,</HI> two great ships on the English side were taken, Captain <HI>Dighy</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="40"/>Commander of the first being killed, and Sir <HI>John Chichely</HI> of the latter made prisoner, but were both shortly after regained by the English prisoners aboard, who forced and overcome their guards. On the Dutch side, Ad∣miral <HI>Van Ghent</HI> was slain, most of their great ships miserably torn, and two of them sunk, and one of fourty eight guns Captain <HI>Elderson</HI> of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> Commander taken, many more were missing, of which no parti∣cular account can be given. The <HI>Dutch</HI> with confidence pleased themselves to brag of a Victory with the accustomed solemnities of rejoycing; and imputed much of the English loss to the French seperating from the rest of the Fleet that day, about noon; but it is certain that the Duke ha∣ving pursued them to their own Coast, and having next day in vain offered battel, kept the
<PB N="77" REF="40"/>seas, and could bring them to no more action this year.</P>
<P>The advice of the prevailing progress of the <HI>French</HI> on the one hand, and the Bishop of <HI>Munster</HI> on the other, which put the States in much apprehension, and the people in great fright and confusion; being brought to <HI>De Ruyter,</HI> as he rode with his Fleet at the Oyster-bank; oc∣casioned his hastening from thence to <HI>Blanckenburgh,</HI> there to put ashoar a great part of his men to be employed at land, where the danger then seemed most pressing: And whilst he continued there with a Fleet half mann'd to secure the arri∣val of the <HI>East-India</HI> Fleet, which was then look't for; the <HI>Duke of York</HI> kept at sea, sometime cruising, sometime at anchor on the <HI>Doggerbank,</HI> in very bad weather, with intention either to seize that Fleet, or to pro∣voke
<PB N="78" REF="41"/>voke the Dutch to a New En∣gagement by their attempting to defend them. About this time the tumult of the untractable people who imputed all their ca∣lamities to the errours of their Governours, grew every where so high, that it seemed to threa∣ten a dissolution of Government; especially at <HI>Dort,</HI> where the <HI>Burghers</HI> armed in a great body having surrounded the house where the <HI>Prince of Orange</HI> sate at dinner, with the Magistrates of the place; sent some of their Officers with a form of writing, containing a New Election of his Highnesse to be hereditary Stat∣holder of the Common-wealth, with a renunciation of all mali∣cious Acts and Edicts made by the <HI>Lovestein</HI> faction to the con∣trary; threatning the Magistrates with the losse of their lives, un∣lesse they presently signed it: This peremptory desire the Magistrates
<PB N="79" REF="41"/>durst not refuse, but presently signed the Writing, and dispen∣ced with the Oath formerly ex∣torted from the Prince, never to accept any such dignity for the future by the contrary and sway∣ing party: and this tumultuary procedure had the influence up∣on the other Corporations, that most did the like; so that at length it advanced so far as to be publickly ratified and confir∣med by the States; so great or∣der many times by a guiding providence is produced from greatest confusion.</P>
<P>In the rage of this unruly multitude <HI>De Ruyter</HI> himself there celebrated tutelary and guardian, though then at sea, for their de∣fence hardly escaped their fury; for a company of common peo∣ple having mutined into a body beset his house in the New Island of <HI>Amsterdam;</HI> and if they had not been hindred by the Magi∣strates
<PB N="80" REF="42"/>had plundered and sackt it: this was so strange when no previous set discourse (that is known) did winde up the Jack to such a revolution; that it af∣fords us another easy and obvi∣ous remark, that men when they are mad, are never wise.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>York</HI> having for many weeks kept his station, and suffered very foul weather on the <HI>Dogger-bank;</HI> and <HI>De Ruyter</HI> at <HI>Blanckenburgh,</HI> without any of∣fer of fighting; the long wished for <HI>East-India</HI> Fleet (which the Duke hoped might give occasion to a new tryal) at length ap∣peared near the Coast of <HI>Holland. De Ruyter</HI> by his advice-boats in∣formed of this, thinking him∣self obliged to use his utmost en∣deavours, for the security of so great a concern: weighed from <HI>Blanckenburgh,</HI> and with a Fleet ill-mann'd, and in bad conditi∣on of fighting; slid along the
<PB N="81" REF="42"/>shoar, without being discovered by the English; met the Fleet, and safely conducted them into <HI>Delfzey</HI> in the <HI>West-Emms.</HI> The <HI>Cambridge</HI> and <HI>Bristol</HI> two Eng∣lish Frigats, being then upon the scout, came up with them, and had some little encounter; but the windes was high, and the sea so rough, that no booty could be gained. The Duke having now lost all hopes of alluring the <HI>Dutch</HI> to any more action this year, left Sir <HI>Edward Spragg</HI> with a squa∣dron of ships to keep the seas, and disturb their fishing, and he him∣self with the rest of the fleet re∣turned home.</P>
<P>The torrent of the French con∣quests at land being now some∣what stopt, and the tumult and, rage of the people quieted, the affairs of Sea came next in play; In the preparations for which, the vigilant <HI>De-Ruyter</HI> with much diligence employed the winter
<PB N="82" REF="43"/>(which happened by reason of its openness, to be very favourable to the <HI>Dutch</HI>) proposing to him∣self reasonable advantages, if he could have a Fleet in readiness next spring at Sea, before the coming of the <HI>French,</HI> which he effected. For in <HI>May</HI> 1673. with a strong and well-appointed Na∣vy commanded by himself, <HI>Van Trump</HI> and <HI>Banckert,</HI> he was out again at Sea, and in the mouth of the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> with de∣signe, by sinking of several great Ships in the narrow passages of the Channel, called the <HI>Middle∣ground,</HI> to have stopped and blockt up the mouth and entry of the river; but the breadth of that channel, and the commodiousness of others, rendred his attempts al∣together in vain.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> who for this Years Expedition Commanded the Royal Navies, lying at the <HI>Buoy of the Nore,</HI> with part
<PB N="83" REF="43"/>of the <HI>English</HI> fleet (the <HI>French</HI> being not as yet arrived) when <HI>De Ruyter</HI> appeared, was hindred by the windes to get out; but afterwards having with much dif∣ficulty put to Sea, and made to∣wards the <HI>Dutch: De Ruyter</HI> not swerving from his former mea∣sures, thinking he gained enough when he did not lose, warily re∣tired behinde the banks, those impregnable sea-ramparts, shun∣ning at that time any engagement: The Prince seeing this, stood with his fleet for the <HI>Streights</HI> off <HI>Calais,</HI> with intention to meet the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Portsmouth</HI> fleets; whom af∣ter a short stay, he having joyned at <HI>Dungean ness,</HI> with the whole fleet, returned for the coast of <HI>Holland,</HI> and <HI>May</HI> 26. 1673. arrived before <HI>Schonvelt</HI> where <HI>de Ruyter</HI> lay with his fleet.</P>
<P>The winde and Sea then unsea∣sonable, allowed no fair opportu∣nity of fighting, but the twenty
<PB N="84" REF="44"/>eighth in the morning, the wea∣ther fair, and a fresh gale, invi∣ted the Prince to action: <HI>De Ruy∣ter</HI> still kept his station where the great ships could not approach: and the Prince resolving by all means possible to draw him to an engagement, sent off thirty five sail of small Frigats to provoke him to battel: The <HI>Dutch</HI> con∣trary to the expectation of the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> in excellent order came forth, and boldly en∣countred this Van-guard of the fleet with such hot service, that they being forced a little to yield, disordered the rest of the Royal Navy: The fight continued des∣perately on both sides, the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> with mutuall emula∣tion behaving themselves brave∣ly, and with so much eagerness, that they entangled each other, and gave some advantage to the enemy: For the Valiant Earl of <HI>Ossory</HI> being pestered amongst the
<PB N="85" REF="44"/><HI>French,</HI> ran foul of an <HI>English</HI> Fregat, and was entangled with a fireship; and was no sooner got clear, but the observant <HI>De Ruyter</HI> laying hold of the oppor∣tunity, bore down upon him with his whole Squadron, and gave him fresh occasion to signa∣lize his Valour: The Earl with his ships that were with him, received the Admirall with no less resolution then he was at∣tacqued, and maintained a bloudy fight, with equal success, till both being sufficiently battered, the night put an end to the con∣flict, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> returned to their lurking holes: In this Fight <HI>de Ruyter</HI> lost only the Ship called the <HI>Debenter,</HI> and had killed the Vice-Admsral <HI>Schram,</HI> Rear-Ad∣miral <HI>Ulugh,</HI> and six Captains: After the old manner both Par∣ties claimed the honour of the Victory; The <HI>Dutch</HI> because they had repulsed the Assailants, and
<PB N="86" REF="45"/>the English because they had for∣ced the <HI>Dutch</HI> to their banks of re∣fuge; but both fleets were much damnified.</P>
<P>The next three days were spent in mending and re-fitting their shattered ships, which the <HI>Dutch</HI> had better opportunity to perform (having all necessaries from their stores at hand) then the <HI>English,</HI> who were so remote from their own Coast; So that <HI>de Ruyter</HI> knowing well the advantage, in the begining of <HI>Iune</HI> put out again, and by his approach allarmed the <HI>English,</HI> who had not as yet got into such readiness; yet notwith∣standing they presently put them∣selves in a posture of engaging, observing the motion of the <HI>Dutch;</HI> which <HI>de Ruyter</HI> perceiving drew all his fleet into a line, reaching three leagues, and so came to an anchor, expecting the coming unto the fleet of the <HI>Heers Boscho∣velt, Van der Meyden, Moregnault,</HI>
<PB N="87" REF="45"/>and <HI>Van der Vierse</HI> the Deputies of the States General; who being arrived and in a Council of War having approved his intent of fighting, and afterward return∣ed again ashoar; on the fourth of <HI>June, De Ruyter</HI> with his whole Fleet, was by eleven of the clock again under sail, mak∣ing directly towards the Eng∣lish, who kept their old stati∣on. Sir <HI>Edward Spragg</HI> Admiral of the English blew squadron, who had the Van, not believing that the Dutch intended to fight, but only as before to change their rode; made no great haste to bear up, and so lost the winde; and being much pressed by the <HI>French,</HI> as they by the Prince in the rear, who were all ea∣ger to come to blows; he was put in some little disorder. The two Fleets for some time fought stoutly, especially where the Earl of <HI>Ossory</HI> and Sir <HI>Edward
<PB N="88" REF="46"/>Spragg</HI> engaged, till the Prince finding the disadvantage of the winde, with the red and white squadrons stood away <HI>N W. De Ruyter</HI> thinking it was to get the winde, which he was not wil∣ling to lose, did the like, and left <HI>Van Trump</HI> with the rest of the Fleet in a sharp conflict with <HI>Spragg</HI> and <HI>Ossory.</HI> The day began to close before the shot on either side betwixt the Prince and <HI>De Ruyter</HI> began to do exe∣cution: but at length the Eng∣lish must confess, that to their great wonder, they first learned here, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> powder was stronger and the guns longer than their own. So Prince <HI>Ru∣pert</HI> having shifted himself from the <HI>Royal Charles</HI> into the <HI>Old Soverain,</HI> and Sir <HI>Edward Spragg</HI> rejoyned the Fleet, they fought at distance most part of the night, and by break of day both Fleets being out of sight of each
<PB N="89" REF="46"/>other, the Prince with the loss of many men, and disabled ships, made for the <HI>Thames;</HI> and <HI>De Ruyter</HI> with little loss having had the advantage of the winde and a distant fight, stood back for his old station on the Coast of <HI>Zeland. De Ruyter</HI> in this acti∣on gave evident proof that he knew when it was time to pur∣sue as well as retreat, and that he never turned his back but with intent to shew his face.</P>
<P>It was now the twentieth of <HI>July</HI> before the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> were in condition again to visit the <HI>Dutch</HI> Coasts, and then ha∣ving discovered <HI>De Ruyter</HI> with his Fleet eight leagues off of the Coast of <HI>Zealand,</HI> and in posture of Fighting, the Royall Navy expected an Engagement, but wise <HI>De Ruyter</HI> who always fought after his own manner, knew well the importance of so great a triall, and that the affairs
<PB N="90" REF="47"/>of his Countrey so embarrassed on all hands, did not require the hazarding of the interest and honour of his Masters, or of himself, without some probable hopes of saving of both; stood in nearer the shoar, and bore a∣way along the Coast, declining all engagement untill the one and twentieth of <HI>August</HI> follow∣ing.</P>
<P>On the twentieth of <HI>August,</HI> Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> being informed that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet were about <HI>Goree,</HI> made thither, and towards the evening discovered them: but being then late, thought best not to attacque them that night: In the mean time <HI>De Ruyter</HI> according to his ordinary conduct improving the benefit of the darkness, stood in close to the shoar, and bearing up before next morning, gained the winde of the English, and by seven of the Clock bore down
<PB N="91" REF="47"/>upon them freshly. The <HI>Prince</HI> upon this, changing his course, stood away S. W. and the <HI>French</HI> who had the Van engaged <HI>Banckert,</HI> the Prince in the middle, <HI>De Ruyter</HI> and Sir <HI>Edward Spragg</HI> in the rear, (after the old manner) <HI>Van Trump.</HI> This Fight was so managed between the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> as if both parties being by some secret instinct ac∣quainted that this was to be the last, resolved to prove their ut∣most and last effects of fortitude and conduct among the <HI>French,</HI> Capt. <HI>Martel</HI> behaved himself bravely: <HI>Banckert</HI> sent off a few ships to wait the <HI>French</HI> motion, and with the rest of his squa∣dron came in to the assistance of <HI>De Ruyter</HI> against the Prince, who for some time valiantly ex∣changed their broadsides, and behaved themselves with equal courage and success. Sir <HI>Edward Spragg</HI> and <HI>Van Trump</HI> (the two
<PB N="92" REF="48"/>declared Competitiours and Ri∣vals for honour) with their squa∣drons in the mean time persisted in action with such determinate resolution, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> avow the like never to have been seen, their own two ships having without touching of a sail strangely endured the fury of three full hours uncessant batte∣ry. But Sir <HI>Edward Spraggs</HI> Ship the <HI>Prince,</HI> having lost her masts, and being so fearfully torn, as to be unfit for more service, with his flag displayed in his boat, he shifted aboard off the <HI>St. George;</HI> and finding her like∣wise disabled, as he was leaving of her to get into the <HI>Royall Charles,</HI> a cruel shot funk his boat, and left him helpless in the Ocean, whose power being grea∣ter then that of <HI>Van Trump;</HI> by his death chill'd that heat of courage, which <HI>Trump</HI> could ne∣ver have cooled above water:
<PB N="93" REF="48"/>His death was by all, even the Dutch themselves bewailed, who acknowledged him to have been a brave man, and valiant Souldi∣er: His Ship couragiously defen∣ded by the stout Earl of <HI>Ossory</HI> (notwithstanding all the at∣tempts that <HI>Van Trump</HI> made to be Master of her.) was safely towed off by the <HI>Hampshire</HI> Fre∣gat. The Prince and <HI>de Ruyter</HI> at this time finding themselves at too great distance from the squadrons so hotly engaged, who stood both in need of as∣sistance; as by mutual consent, tacked both, and in friendly manner without firing, stood to∣wards their respective friends: but <HI>de Ruyter</HI> having joyned <HI>Van Trump</HI> who was still engaged, with the blew, before the Prince could could come in; fell upon the blew with renewed fury, intending to have totally out off that squadron from the rest of the
<PB N="94" REF="49"/>English Fleet; but at length the Prince coming in time, broke in amongst the Dutch with unan∣swerable force, and Captain <HI>Legg</HI> with his fireships, put them in great disorder and confusion; It was believed by all, that if the <HI>French</HI> had made their best use of that winde, <HI>de Ruyter</HI> and his Fleet could not so fairly (as they did) by the favour of the night, have taken their leave of this and all other publick action with the English, during this War. The losses in this last Fight were great on both sides; many brave Com∣manders, and Vast number of men killed and wounded; but both so positively pretending to victory, it is hard to determine who had the better; yet the Dutch by Sir <HI>Edward Spraggs</HI> death think∣ing their title good, made the whole Countrey so merry with the ringing noise of Victory: that the States changed the following
<PB N="95" REF="49"/>day of Humiliation into thanks∣giving, and in stead of fasting, drunk and sung Psalms.</P>
<P>The singular prudence and con∣duct of Admiral <HI>de Ruyter</HI> in the several passages of this War, ren∣dred him so useful to his Countrey (of whose tottering and decay∣ing state he seemed the <HI>Atlas</HI> and guardian) and so considerable to his enemies, who by experience found it not easy to triumph-over him; that notwithstanding the powerful efforts made for that end, the success of affairs remai∣ned so little inclined to either side, that the one had no reason to despair, nor the other to scorn the prossers of accommodation; made way for a Treaty of peace with <HI>England;</HI> and the States of <HI>Holland</HI> catching their opportuni∣ty, when the vigorous intercessi∣on of the Crown, and Ministers of <HI>Spain</HI> concurred so pat with the publick good offices of their
<PB N="96" REF="50"/>friends in <HI>England:</HI> they so ef∣fectually pursued the necessary and advantagious concern of peace with that kingdom, that by the frequent sollicitations and busy importunities of one and other, the King of <HI>Great Britain</HI> did at length condescend to a peace with the Dutch: which was concluded at <HI>West∣minster</HI> the Ninth of <HI>February,</HI> 1674. to the unspeakable joy of the States, and perpetual renown of <HI>de Ruyter,</HI> in such a pinching nick of time, that the Dutch had good reason to be thankfull for so seasonable an accomoda∣tion.</P>
<P><HI>Janus</HI> Temple being thus half shut, and the States General ha∣ving now but one way to look; resolved to bend all their forces against the <HI>French,</HI> both by Sea and land: and knowing that the <HI>French</HI> would not adventure to meet them at Sea; being dis∣joyned
<PB N="97" REF="50"/>from the English; judg∣ed it most convenient to molest their navigation, annoy their Coasts, and destroy (as much as conveniently could be done) their Countrey and Plantations. In Order hereunto, they sent out a great Fleet of sixty six men of War, besides victuallars, ten∣ders and fireships, under the Com∣mand of Lieutenant Admirall <HI>De Ruyter,</HI> and <HI>Van Trump,</HI> with a flying Army of Land-forces, Com∣manded by Count <HI>William Van Horn.</HI> This Fleet joyned at their rendevous on the fourteenth of <HI>May</HI> 1674. set sail from the <HI>Weel∣ings;</HI> and having by a Squadron of fifteen men of War, allarmed all the Coast of <HI>Calais</HI> and <HI>Bulloigne,</HI> they passed along the English shoar, and <HI>Isle of Wight,</HI> and come to anchor in <HI>Tourbay.</HI> Here after a great Councill of War, they divided the Fleet into two Squadrons; appointing one and
<PB N="98" REF="51"/>twenty fail of Men of War, and fourty eight other Ships, with se∣veral Companies of Land-souldi∣ers, under the Command of Old <HI>De Ruyter</HI> Admiral, <HI>Evertse</HI> of <HI>Zealand</HI> Vice-Admiral, and young <HI>Engell de Ruyter</HI> Son of the other Rear-Admiral for the Western French Islands; and <HI>Van Trump</HI> and the Count <HI>Horn,</HI> with the rest of the fleet and Land-forces, for the Coast of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The designe so laid, was accord∣ingly put in execution; for <HI>De Ruyter</HI> with his fleet on the 29. of <HI>May</HI> made sail to the Westward, and ten days after <HI>Van Trump</HI> for the coast of <HI>France; de Ruyter</HI> conti∣nuing his course with fair windes, on the ninth of <HI>Iuly</HI> came in sight of the <HI>Isle of Martenique,</HI> and the tenth arrived in the Bay called <HI>Cu∣sack:</HI> The <HI>French</HI> being advertised of their coming, appeared in readi∣ness, marching towards the shoar, and the Dutch with some small
<PB N="99" REF="51"/>ships that sailed near the land, told them their errand, by firing smart∣ly against them from aboard? this salute forced the <HI>French</HI> a little to retreat, and burn some houses, which they thought stood in their way, and favoured the Enemy: In the afternoon a Council of War being held, a descent was conclu∣ded on, and <HI>de Ruyter</HI> having given the signe of landing, the land∣forces divided into 3. squadrons, under the Command of Col. <HI>Vy∣tenhove,</HI> with 20 men to throw gra∣nadoes for each Squadron, imme∣diatly embarked in their boats and shalloops, and with great cou∣rage, notwithstanding the <HI>French</HI> violent firing on them from their ships which they had ashoar, and out of their woods, landed and made themselves Masters of a Bank, which the <HI>French</HI> had cast up to prevent their landing, and forced the Enemy to retire to their Fort: <HI>De Ruyter</HI> perceiving
<PB N="100" REF="52"/>the Engagement hot, sent off 1500. seamen to reinforce his par∣ty, but the <HI>French</HI> firing furious∣ly from behinde their ships, and battery, which they had raised, flanking the <HI>Dutch</HI> who stood na∣ked to their shot, and whose Ca∣non did them little service, to∣wards the Evening beat them off again to their ships, with the loss of many men, and several brave Officers, and so freed the Island at this time from further dan∣ger.</P>
<P><HI>De Ruyter</HI> after much loss find∣ing the attempt fruitless, left four ships to cruise thereabouts, and wait the coming of some Victu∣allers expected from <HI>Holland,</HI> and next day sailed to <HI>Dominico,</HI> there to take in fresh water, which be∣ing done, passing by <HI>Mevis</HI> and the <HI>Barmoodoes,</HI> and having mu∣tually received and rendered ci∣vilities with the <HI>English</HI> there, made sail for <HI>Holland,</HI> and about
<PB N="101" REF="52"/>latter end of <HI>September,</HI> with lit∣tle success in this expedition, ar∣rived safely at home, and <HI>Trump</HI> and <HI>Van-Horn</HI> having by several descents on <HI>Bell-Isle,</HI> and other parts of that coast of <HI>France,</HI> al∣larmed and vexed the <HI>French,</HI> and plundered the country; and the fleet having after conducted and brought back from <HI>Spain</HI> the Count <HI>Van Horn,</HI> who went to negotiate at <HI>Madrid,</HI> with 18 sail of the fleet (the rest being other∣ways imployed) in the latter end of <HI>November</HI> following, returned likewise to the <HI>Texell.</HI></P>
<P>Now the difficulty of the re∣ducing <HI>Messina,</HI> so strongly pro∣tected by the <HI>French,</HI> requiring much of the care and Forces of <HI>Spain</HI> to be employed in <HI>Sicily,</HI> sensibly weakened the Confede∣rates of the States of <HI>Holland</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where the danger lay at their doors. The States there∣fore being sollicited by the Mi∣nisters
<PB N="102" REF="53"/>of <HI>Spain,</HI> that they might either give a necessary diversion to the <HI>French,</HI> who in good ear∣nest espoused the quarrel, and endeavoured the assistance of the <HI>Messinesses,</HI> and thereby hinder the progresse nearer home; or that they might effectually aid the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to the intire subduing of these Revolters, and so bring over to <HI>Flanders</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> For∣ces, and other instruments of war employed in these parts; In the beginning of 1675. resolved to dispatch their successeful Admi∣ral <HI>De Ruyter,</HI> with a considera∣ble fleet of Men of war into the <HI>Streights,</HI> to joyn the Prince <HI>Mon∣tesarchio</HI> Generall of the <HI>Spanish Armada</HI> for the effecting of that designe; accordingly about the latter end of <HI>August, de Ruyter</HI> with a fleet of 25. sail, wyed from <HI>Schonvelt,</HI> and having stopt at <HI>Ca∣diz,</HI> and other places, by the way, in <HI>December</HI> following joyn∣ed
<PB N="103" REF="53"/><HI>Montesarchio</HI> at <HI>Palermo</HI> with part of his Fleet, and after that he had stayed some time for those of his Ships which then were re∣turned to <HI>Naples</HI> from <HI>Argiers</HI> under the Command of Vice-Ad∣miral <HI>de Haen,</HI> and received them at the place of Rendevouz: They sailed all together from <HI>Palermo</HI> to <HI>Melazzo,</HI> where <HI>de Ruyter</HI> ha∣ving had conference with the Duke of <HI>Ferrandina</HI> the Spanish Viceroy of <HI>Sicily,</HI> It was resolved that the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet by Sea, and the Vice-roy by Land should attacque and molest <HI>Messina,</HI> before that any further succours did arrive there: In or∣der to that, <HI>de Ruyter</HI> being in∣formed of a Fleet of Ships laden with provisions and necessaries for the besieged who then were in great straits by want, and not like long to subsist without re∣lief, being at sea under the Con∣voy of a squadron of Men of
<PB N="104" REF="54"/>War commanded by the <HI>Sieur de Quesny,</HI> made towards the fare of <HI>Messina</HI> to intercept and hinder their passage; and whilest the Prince <HI>Montesarchio</HI> left with some ships to guard the mouth of the fare, was separated from the rest of the Fleet, on the 29th of <HI>January,</HI> 1675. <HI>de Ruyter</HI> en∣countred the <HI>French</HI> off of <HI>Lipari,</HI> with a fleet not much odd in number to his own, having both between twenty and thirty sail of Men of War a piece, besides galleys, fireships, and other small craft, and with much courage and bravery engaged them: The <HI>French</HI> received him with no less resolution; so that there began a very brisk dispute betwixt them, which continued all that day and the next, with considerable damage to their Ships and rigging, but no great losse of men, the fight having been at some distance: In this
<PB N="105" REF="54"/>engagement the <HI>French</HI> lost one man of War, and two fireships, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> one Fregat, which being disabled in the engage∣ment, as the Galleys were towing of her off for <HI>Palermo,</HI> sunk, but the men were saved. The day following <HI>de Ruyter</HI> being advi∣sed, that the <HI>Sieur de Quesny</HI> by another way round the Island, unperceived by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> had conveyed the destin'd succours into <HI>Messina;</HI> and foreseeing well the bad consequences of the dis∣appointment, being much dis∣pleased with the slow proceedings of the <HI>Spanish</HI> grave &amp; Phlegma∣tick circumspection, and their conduct of affairs; thought it not convenient further to pursue the <HI>French,</HI> nor to abide longer in these quarters, (the six Moneths appointed by the States his Ma∣sters for that expedition being now expired) and therefore ha∣ving rejoyned <HI>Montesarchio</HI> with
<PB N="106" REF="55"/>his eight Spanish Men of War, he took his leave of him, in order to his returning home∣ward.</P>
<P>This sudden departure threat∣ned by <HI>de Ruyter,</HI> put the Vice∣roys of <HI>Sicily</HI> and <HI>Naples</HI> in great perplexity, and the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> in much trouble, who judged thereby the businesse of <HI>Messina</HI> almost desperate; so that all means possible were used by the Agents of <HI>Spain,</HI> to retain him in these parts; and particularly importunate in∣stances in <HI>Holland</HI> for the pro∣longing the time of his Commis∣sion, which prevailed.</P>
<P>New Orders from <HI>Holland</HI> be∣ing arrived at <HI>Naples,</HI> the Vice∣roy the Duke <HI>de los Velos,</HI> fearing that <HI>de Ruyter</HI> might pass with∣out touching there, and so misse of receiving of his Letters, of so great concern to the <HI>Spanish</HI> in∣terest: sent off the Dutch Con∣sul
<PB N="107" REF="55"/>with some Galleys to meet him, and to acquaint him with the will of the States, and to in∣vite him to <HI>Naples:</HI> This occasi∣oned <HI>de Ruyters</HI> coming to <HI>Naples,</HI> where he was splendidly enter∣tained by the Vice-roy; and in visiting the City treated with the same honours as are usually rendred to his own person, but hastened again aboard. The ad∣vice sent from <HI>Holland</HI> of his Commission renewed, and a re-inforcement of his Fleet pro∣mised, set him at work to ani∣mate and push forward the slow and heavy march of the Spaniards in the execution of their Goun∣sils; and so having cruised with his Fleet some time at <HI>Palermo,</HI> and some time at <HI>Melazzo;</HI> and had conference with the Vice∣roy of <HI>Sicily:</HI> It was condescend∣ed on, that <HI>Augusta,</HI> a place that held for the Rebels, should be invested by Sea and Land, and
<PB N="108" REF="56"/>accordingly <HI>de Ruyter</HI> with his fleet made haste for the <HI>Bay of Au∣gusta,</HI> a place to him too satal for so famous a name; whilest he was there, intelligence was brought him, that the <HI>French</HI> were at Sea; whereupon that night he sailed, and next morn∣ing got sight of the Enemy, they being about the Cape <HI>Spartivento,</HI> and he himself with his fleet three Leagues from <HI>Augusta:</HI> The morn∣ing was calm, so that he could not come up with the Enemy, but in the afternoon a fresh gale blowing from S. E. brought both fleets nearer together: <HI>De Ruyter</HI> being in the Van, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the body, and Vice-Admiral <HI>de Haen</HI> in the Rear of the fleet, which besides the <HI>Spanish</HI> consist∣ed but of seventeen <HI>Dutch</HI> Men of War, with other galleys, fire∣ships and small craft; They bore down with great eagerness upon the <HI>French,</HI> consisting of thirty
<PB N="109" REF="56"/>Men of war, and seven fireships, with galleys, and other Tenders: About four in the afternoon the fight began, and lasted till seven, with obstinate resolution and cou∣rage, betwixt the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> who sustained the whole brunt of this Engagement; for the <HI>Spanish</HI> did but little, only kept themselves out of harms way, and did what mischief they could at a distance.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> had in this Engage∣ment three Ships so disabled as to be towed off, and one Captain kil∣led, but smaller losses are undis∣cernable when the great <HI>De Ruyter</HI> fell; For here it was that pres∣sing the <HI>French</HI> at the latter end of the Fight, so as to make them give way; a bold bullet from the Enemies Fleet stopt him in his carreer; which having carri∣ed away part of his left foot, and broke his left leg above the ancle, threw him on the deck,
<PB N="110" REF="57"/>so as by his fall he was woun∣ded in the head: The Fleet here∣upon slackened sail, and stood for the Bay of <HI>Syracusa:</HI> The wounded General was carried a∣shoar for the more conveniency of cure; which then did not seem desperate, but the greatness of his minde unacquainted with such checks of fortune, encrea∣sed so that distemper of body; which it patiently bore, that the nineteenth of <HI>April</HI> having been speechless a day before, be∣tween nine and ten of the Clock at night, in the Seveniteth year and Second Moneth of his Age, at the first violent summons of Fortune; yeelded his last Duty to Nature; and as he had lived, died in the embraces of beloved honour.</P>
<P>This his Death, as it filled his friends and Countrey with grief and lamentation, and all men with pitty and regret, so
<PB N="111" REF="57"/>being a losse great enough to cast the ballance of advantage even to the most forlorn and des∣pairing side; gave the <HI>French</HI> a Victory not equalled by their confederate Adversaries, unless when last year Triumphant <HI>Tu∣rene</HI> the only Paragon of his worth and fame, upon a different Stage, played his last Act: which two great Champions much un∣like in their Original (the one being born to a great share of his honour, and the other to make all his own,) did so re∣semble each other, in the course of their Lives and Fortune, and manner and Circumstances of dying; that it seemed nature had framed them for two Sub∣jects whereon Fortune might shew her skill, in dispencing e∣qually her inclinations to great and powerfull adversaries in the highest pitch of competition. For as either had been the constant
<PB N="112" REF="58"/>Favourite of their respective Masters, and the often and long experieneed prop of their Victo∣rious hopes; the one at Land, and the other at Sea, so both fell by an interchanged great Shot, in such a point of time, when their actions gave great hopes and confidence to their several Parties; and their death was at∣tended with remarkable and dangerous consequences to either side: and had Fortune proceed∣ed from the beginning, and should she still continue with so even and impartial a hand in all the occurrences and transactions, of this formidable war; both parties might have occasion to celebrate their triumphs with tears, and with drawn stakes sit down, and mutually confess, that</P>
<Q><HI>Iam sumus ergo pares.</HI></Q>
<PB N="113" REF="58"/>
<P><HI>De Ruyter</HI> was a person (as most brave men have been) of a middle stature, a strong and well compacted body, not fat, but fleshy, of a gracefull and majestick countenance, his as∣pect pleasant and chearfull, not terrible by too much fierceness, nor by too great mildeness un∣awful; of a complexion san∣guine, and a constitution tempe∣rate and healthfull; sober in his diet, and moderate, though free in his words; neither sullen with rigid and morose reservedness, nor by loquacity affected or vain; his gestures manly and natural; and generally of a frame of tem∣per so even and harmonious, as rendred him sedate and constant, and altogether free from the mistakes and waverings that ac∣company fickle and light natures, in the greater vicissitudes of for∣tune: He advanced to the height of Honour by the regular steps
<PB N="114" REF="59"/>of merit and patience, never im∣portuning his destiny by untime∣ly and precipitant ambition; nor slighting or being out of the way when Fortune called him to preferment: which he con∣ducted by such wise and prudent measures, as made him accepta∣ble to all; not staining the repu∣tation of his great actions by vain-glorious ostentation, and overweening pride; but by being dutiful to his superiours, respect∣full to his equalls, gratefull to his benefactors, affable and cour∣teous to his inferiours; and in a word, obliging to all: he gained the love and esteem of all that knew him; entertaining e∣ven the meanest of the acquain∣tances of his low estate with that civility, that if in the top of honour, they enjoyed not the ancient familiarity of his baser fortune, they easily saw, that it was his place and dignity, and
<PB N="115" REF="59"/>not the change of humour, that altered the stile. <HI>In fine,</HI> he was so good a man, so devout and pious a Christian, so stout a Souldier, so wise, expert, and successfull a General; and so faithfull, trusty, and honest a Lover of his Countrey, that he deserves justly to be recommen∣ded to Posterity, as an ornament of his Age, the darling of the Seas, and the delight and ho∣nour of his Countrey.</P>
