<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T may well bee thought (Right wor∣shipfull) as many learned
men are of opinion, that the actions and aduen∣tures of the ancients long
since done &amp; performed, haue beene set forth with more show of wonder
and strangenesse then they in truth deserued: the reason as I think
was, because that in those daies there were many lear∣ned and wise men,
who in their writings sought by all meanes they could to excell each other,
touching the description of Countries &amp; nations: And againe to the
contrarie, for want of good Historiographers and writers, many famous actes
and trauels of diuers nations and Countries lie hidden, and in a manner buried
vnder ground, as wholly forgotten and vn∣knowne, vnlesse it were such as
the Grecians and Romanes for their owne glories and aduantages thought good to
declare. But to come to the matter of voyages by sea, it is euident to all
the world, what voyage <HI>Iason</HI> with certaine yong Grecian Princes made
to <HI>Colchos</HI> in the Oriental Countries to winne the golden Fleece, as
also the trauels by <HI>Hercules</HI> performed into <HI>Libia</HI> in the
West partes, to winne the <HI>Aurea Mala</HI> or golden apples of
<HI>Hesperides,</HI> which notwithstanding neither for length, daunger, nor
profite, are any thing comparable to the nauigations and voyages, that of late
within the space of <PB REF="4"/> one hundreth years haue been performed &amp;
made into the East &amp; West Indies, whereby in a manner there is not one
hauen on the sea coast, nor any point of land in the whole world, but hath
in time beene sought and founde out. I will not at this present dispute
or make an argument, whether the Countries and na∣tions of late yeares found
out and discouered, were knowne to the auncients, but this is most certaine,
that not any strange worke or aduenture was, or euer shall be performed,
but by the speciall grace, fauour and mightie hand of God, and that such
are worthy perpetual memory, as with noble minds haue sought to effect, and
be the first enterprisers thereof, and with most valiant courages and
wisedomes, haue performed such long &amp; dangerous voyages into the East
and West Indies, as also such Kinges and Princes, as with their Princely
liberalities haue imployed their treasures, shippes, men and munitions to
the furtherance and performance of so worthy actes, which not∣withstanding
in the end turned to their great aduancementes and inriching with great
treasures, which by those meanes they haue drawn, &amp; caused in great
aboundance to be brought from thence, in such manner, that the King of
<HI>Spaine</HI> nowe liuing, (hauing both the Indies in his possession,
&amp; reaping the abundant treasures which yearly are brought out of those
coun∣tries) hath not only (although couertly) sought all the means he could
to bring all Christendome vnder his dominion, but also (that which no King
or country whatsoeuer although of grea∣ter might then he hath euer done) hee
is not ashamed to vse this posie, <HI>Necspe, nec metu.</HI> And
although the first foun∣ders and discouerers of those Countries haue
alwayes sought to hinder and intercept other nations from hauing any part of
their glorie, yet hereby all nations, &amp; indifferent persons may well know
and perceiue the speciall policie, and valour of these vnited Prouinces, in
trauelling into both the Indies, in the <PB REF="4"/> faces, &amp; to the great
griefe of their many and mighty enemies. Wherby it is to be hoped, that if they
continue in their enter∣prises begun, they will not onely draw the most
part of the In∣dian treasures into these Countries, but thereby
disinherite &amp; spoyle the Countrie of <HI>Spayne</HI> of her principall
reuenewes, and treasures of marchandises and trafiques, which she
continually vseth and receyueth out of these countries, and out of
<HI>Spayne</HI> are sent into the Indies, and so put the King of
<HI>Spaine</HI> himselfe in minde of his foolish deuise which hee vseth
for a posie tou∣ching the new world, which is, <HI>Non sufficit orbis,</HI>
like a se∣cond <HI>Alexander magnus,</HI> desiring to rule ouer all the
world, as it is manifestly knowne. And because this discription is fallen
into my handes, wherein is contayned the first voyage of the Low-country men
into the East Indies, with the aduen∣tures happened vnto them, set downe
and iustified by such as were present in the voyage, I thought it good to
put it in print, with many pictures and cardes, whereby the reader may the
easilier perceyue and discerne, the natures, apparels, and fashi∣ons of
those Countries and people, as also the manner of their shippes, together
with the fruitfulnesse and great aboundance of the same, hoping that this
my labour will not onely be accep∣table vnto all Marchants and Saylers, which
hereafter meane to traffique into those Countries, but also pleasant and
profita∣ble to all such as are desirous to looke into so newe and
strange things, which neuer heretofore were knowne vnto our nation. And
againe for that all histories haue their particular commo∣ditie, (specially
such as are collected and gathered together) not by common report, from the
first, seconde, or thirde man, but by such as haue seene and beene
present in the actions, and that are liuing to iustifie and verifie the
same: And although eloquence and words well placed in shewing a history,
are great ornamentes and beautifyinges to the same, yet such reports &amp; 
<PB REF="5"/> declarations are much more worthy credite, &amp; commendabler for
the benefit of the commonwealth, which are not set down or disciphered by
subtill eloquence, but showne and performed by simple plaine men, such
as by copiousnesse of wordes, or sub∣tiltie do not alter or chaunge the
matter from the truth there∣of, which at this day is a common and notorious
fault in many Historiographers: And thinking with my selfe to whome I were
best to dedicate the same, I found it not fitter for any then for the right
worshipfull Gouernours of this famous Towne of <HI>Middelborgh,</HI> wherein
for the space of 19. yeares I haue peaceably continued, specially because
your worships do not one∣ly deale with great store of shipping, and
matter belonging to nauigation, but are also well pleased to heare, and
great fur∣therers to aduance both shipping and traffiques, wherein
con∣sisteth not onely the welfare of all marchants, inhabitants, and
cittizens of this famous City, but also of all the common wealth of the
vnited Prouinces, hoping your worships wil not onely ac∣cept this my labour,
but protect &amp; warrantise the same against all men: Wherwith I
beseech God to blesse you with wise∣dome, and godly policie, to gouerne
the Common wealth: <HI>Middleborgh</HI> this 19 of October. 1597.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="section">
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He ancient Historiographers and discribers of the world haue
much commended, and at large with great prayse set downe the diuers and
seuerall voyages of many no∣ble &amp; valiant Captains (as of <HI>Alex∣ander
Magnus, Seleucus, Antiochus, Patrocles, Onesecritus</HI>) into the East
<HI>Indies,</HI> which not∣withstanding haue not set downe a great part of
those coontries, as not being as then discouered, whereby it is thought and
iudged by some men, that <HI>India</HI> is the full third part of all the
world, because of the great Pro∣uinces, mighty Citties, famous and Islands
(full of cost∣ly marchandises, and treasures from thence brought into all
partes of the worlde) that are therein: Where∣in the auncient writers were very
curious, and yet not so much as men in our age: They had some know∣ledge
thereof, but altogether vncertaine, but we at this day are fully certified
therein, both touching the coun∣tries, townes, streames and hauens, with the
trafiques therein vsed and frequented, whereby all the world, so farre
distant and seperated from those strange nations, are by trade of
marchandises vnited therevnto, &amp; ther∣by commonly knowne vnto them: The
Portingalles first began to enterprise the voyage, who by art of
na∣uigation (in our time much more experienced &amp; grea∣ter then in times
past, and therefore easilier performed) <PB REF="6"/> discouered those
wild Countries of <HI>India,</HI> therein pro∣curing great honour to their
King, making his name fa∣mous, and bringing a speciall and great profite of
all kindes of spices into their Countrie, which thereby is spread
throughout all the worlde, yet that sufficed not, for that the Englishmen
(not inferiour to any nation in the world for arte of nauigation) haue
likewise vnder∣taken the Indian voyage, and by their said voyages into
those Countries, made the same commonly knowne vnto their Country, wherein
Sir <HI>Fraunces Drake,</HI> and M. <HI>Candish</HI> are chiefly to bee
commended, who not onely sayled into the East <HI>Indies,</HI> but also
rounde about the world, with most prosperous voyages, by which their
voyages, ours haue beene furthered and set forwarde, for that the condition
of the <HI>Indies</HI> is, that the more it is sayled into, the more it is
discouered, by such as sayle the same, so strange a Countrey it is:
So that besides the famous voyages of the Countries aforesaid, in the ende
certain people came into <HI>Holland</HI> (a nation wel known) certifying them,
that they might easily prepare certaine shippes to sayle into the East
<HI>Indies,</HI> there to traffique &amp; buy spyces, &amp;c. By sayling
straight from <HI>Hollande</HI> and also from other countries bordering
about it, with de∣sire to see strange and rich wares of other Countries,
&amp; that should not be brought vnto them by strangers, but by their owne
countrey men, which some men would esteeme to be impossible,
considering the long voyage and the daungers thereof, together with the
vnaccusto∣med saylinges and little knowledge thereof by such as neuer
sayled that way, and rather esteeme it madnesse, then any point of
wisedome, and folly rather then good consideration. But notwithstanding
wee haue seene <PB N="2" REF="6"/> foure ships make that voyage, who after
many dangers hauing performed their voyage, returned againe and haue brought
with them those wares, that would neuer haue beene thought coulde haue beene
brought into these countries by any <HI>Holland</HI> ships; but what
shoulde I herein most commende eyther the willingnesse and good
performance of the parties, or the happinesse of their voyage? whereof that
I may giue the reader some knowledge, I will shew what I haue hearde and
beene informed of, concerning the description of the Coun∣tries, customes,
and manners of the nations, by them in this voyage seene &amp; discouered,
which is as followeth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">When and how the ships set saile.</NOTE>In
the yeare of our Lord 1595. vpon the 10. day of the month of March, there
departed from <HI>Amsterdam</HI> three ships and a Pinnace to sayle into
the East <HI>Indies,</HI> set forth by diuers rich Marchantes: The first
called <HI>Mauritius,</HI> of the burthen of 400. tunnes, hauing in her sixe
demie canon, fourteene Culuerins, and other pee∣ces, &amp; 4. peeces to shoot
stones, &amp; 84. men: the May∣ster <HI>Iohn Moleuate,</HI> the Factor
<HI>Cornelius Houtman:</HI> The second named <HI>Hollandia,</HI> of the
burthen of 400. tunnes, hauing 85. men, seuen brasse peeces, twelue
peeces for stones, and 13. iron peeces, the Mayster <HI>Iohn Dignums,</HI>
the Factor <HI>Gerrit van Buiningen,</HI> the thirde called
<HI>Am∣sterdam,</HI> of the burthen of 200. tuns, wherein were 59. men,
sixe brasse peeces, ten iron peeces, and sixe peeces for stones, the
Mayster <HI>Iohn Iacobson Schellinger,</HI> the Factor <HI>Reginer van
hel:</HI> The fourth being a Pinnace cal∣led the <HI>Doue,</HI> of the burthen
of 50. tunnes, with twenty men, the Mayster <HI>Simon Lambertson:</HI>
Which 4. ships vpon the 21. of the same moneth came vnto the Tassel,
where they stayed for the space of 12. daies to take in <PB REF="7"/> their
lading, and the seconde of Aprill following, they set saile with a North
east winde &amp; following on their course the fourth of the same moneth
they passed the heades; The sixt they saw <HI>Heyssant,</HI> the
10. of April they passed by the Barles of <HI>Disbon:</HI> With an East
and North East wind, the 17. of Aprill they discouered two of the Islands
of <HI>Canaries:</HI> The 19. <HI>Palm,</HI> and <HI>Pic, Los Romeros,</HI> and
<HI>Fero:</HI> The 25. of Aprill they saw <HI>Bona visita,</HI> the 16.
they ankered vnder <HI>Isole de May:</HI> The 27. they set sayle againe
and held their course South Southeast. The 4. of May, we espied two of
the King of <HI>Spaines</HI> ships, that came from <HI>Lisbone,</HI> and went
for the East <HI>Indies,</HI> about 1000. or 1200. tunnes each ship, with
whom we spake, and told them that we were bound for the straights of
<HI>Magellanes,</HI> but being better of sayle then they, wee got presently
out of their sight. The 12. of May being vnder fiue degrees on this side
the Equinoctiall line, we espyed fiue ships laden with Sugar, comming from
the Island of <HI>S. Thomas,</HI> and sayled for <HI>Lisbone,</HI> to whome
we gaue certaine letters, which were safely deliuered in <HI>Holland.</HI>
Departing from them and keeping on our course, vpon the fourth of Iune we
passed the Equinoc∣tial line, where the extreame heat of the ayre spoyled
all our victuailes: 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their vi∣ctuailes stunke and
spoyled.</NOTE>Our flesh and fishe stunke, our Bisket molded, our Beere
sowred, our water stunke, and our Butter became as thinne as Oyle, whereby
diuers of our men fell sicke, and many of them dyed; but after that we
learned what meat and drinke we should carrie with vs that would keepe good. 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">They pas∣sed the sandes of
<HI>Brasilia.</HI></NOTE>The 28. of Iune wee passed the sandes of
<HI>Brasill,</HI> by the Portingalles called <HI>Abrolhos,</HI> which are
certaine places which men must looke warely vnto, otherwise they are very
dangerous.</P>

lightnings, with great stormes, harde by the sands men are in daunger to be

then East and East and by North. Vpon the seconde of Iuly wee passed
<HI>Tropicus Cancri,</HI> vnder 23. degrees, and ½. The <HI>13.</HI> of

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tokens of the Cape <HI>de bona

20. a bird as bigge as a Swan, whereof foure or fiue together is a good signe

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They en∣tred into <HI>Agne

<HI>de bona Sperance,</HI> and the fourth of the same Month we entered into a
hauen called <HI>Agne Sambras,</HI> where wee ankered, and found good depth at
8. or 9. fadome wa∣ter, sandy ground.</P>
<P>The 5. day we went on shore to gather fruite, there∣with to
refresh our sicke men, that were thirty or 33. in one shippe. In this bay
lyeth a smal Islande, where∣in are many birdes called <HI>Pyncuius</HI> and
sea Wolues that are taken with mens handes: we went into the coun∣trey and
spake with the inhabitantes, who brought di∣uers fresh victuailes aborde
our shippes, for a knife or small peece of Iron, &amp;c. giuing vs an Oxe,
or a sheepe &amp;c. The sheepe in those Countries haue great tayles, 
<PB REF="9"/> and are fat and delicate. Their Oxen are indifferent good, hauing
lumps of flesh vpon their backes, that are as fat as any of our good brisket
beefe: the inhabitantes are of small stature, well ioynted and boned, they
goe naked, couering their members with Foxes and other beastes tayles: they
seeme cruell, yet with vs they vsed all kind of friendship, but are very
beastly and stinking, in such sort, that you may smell them in the
wind at the least a fadome from you: They are apparrelled with beastes
skinnes made fast about their neckes: some of them, being of the better
sort, had their mantles cut &amp; raysed checkerwise, which is a great
ornament with them: They eate raw flesh, as it is new killed, and the
entrailes of beastes without washing or making cleane, gnawing it like
dogs, vnder their feet they tye peeces of beastes skinnes, in steed of
shooes, that they may trauel in the hard wayes: We could not see their
habitations, for wee saw no houses they had, neither could wee
vn∣derstande them, for they speake very strangely, much like the children
in our Countrey with their pipes, and clocking like Turkey Cockes: At the
first wee saw a∣bout thirtie of them, with weapons like pikes, with broade
heades of Iron, about their armes they ware ringes of <HI>Elpen</HI> bones:
There wee coulde finde ney∣ther Oringes nor Lemons, which we purposely
sought for.</P>

into a small Bay, but because wee founde no good anker ground, as also
being very foule we sayled out a∣gaine. The 14. we sayled vnder a small
Island about a mile or 2. great, by the Hollanders called their Church yarde,
or the dead Island, because many saylers dying in that place, were buried
in the <HI>African</HI> earth, and the 29. of the same Month died <HI>Iohn

<P>Meane time the Pinnace was sent out to looke for fresh water,
which hauing found, the boat returned to bring vs newes, and therewith the

ankered before the Riuer, and went on shore, where we found good proui∣sion
of all necessaries, the inhabitantes being very wil∣ling thereunto,
bringing vs of al things that we needed, where for a Pewter Spoone wee had an

by a company of wild men, against whom our wea∣pons little preuayled, for
they hurt one of our men, and tooke all that we had from vs, whereby vpon the

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why their houses stand so high aboue the

We taught them what our Peeces ment, for wee perceyued that they knew them not,

had such Ringes with vs, wee might haue sold them at what prices wee
woulde. They like∣wise vse beades of Glasse, which they weare about

<P>The third of February we had so great a storme, that most of
our ankers were lost, and we ran vpon the land in great daunger to cast our
ships away, but God holpe vs, for the storme ceased, and then we went to
hoyse vp our lost ankers, and so againe went to anker vnder the Island,
glad that we had so well escaped that daunger. The fift of February we went
to seeke for our boats, but the wild men had smitten them in peeces, &amp;
taken out the nailes, thinking likewise that our shippes woulde haue beene
cast away vpon the shore, which they still expected: and when we came
thither, they stood vpon the shore with their weapons in hand and threw
stones at vs, and we perceyuing them in that minde, made to∣wardes our

them without commissi∣on from our Generall, whom we certified thereof. The

they were become our ene∣mies, threatning and casting stones at vs,
wherevpon we put out two shalops to run a shore close to the land, and
made our Caliuers and other weapons ready.</P>

they knew not what they ment, they thought likewise that the peeces coulde

<P>The 12. of Februarie wee hoised anker, and set sayle out of
the great Bay of <HI>Antongil,</HI> being well prouided of all necessaries,
we put out with a North wind, the Bay stretching Northeast and Southwest:
The 2. of March we had a West winde, our course being East and East
&amp; by North towards <HI>Iaua.</HI> In March and Aprill about the Islande
of <HI>Brandawe,</HI> we found that our Compasses helde two Strikes to
farre Northwarde, and we coulde not perceiue the sands that are set downe
in the <HI>Portin∣galles</HI> sea Cards, but we saw many turnings of
streames, and we were much troubled with calmes, but with the new Moone we
had winde enough out of the West &amp; North west. The 27. of May we found
the water abord our shippes to bee much lessened, and therefore euery
mans portion was but halfe as much as he was wont to haue; so that each man
was allowed but foure draughts euery day, which was but a small quantitie.
Whereby through the extreame heat we endured great thirst, so that at that
time a draught of water abord our ship was worth a Riall of 8. The first of
Iuly we saw the Islande of <HI>Emgano,</HI> whereat we much reioyced,
because of the great thirst wee endured in our shippe, and when wee made
neerer to it, we perceyued it to be an Islande ly∣ing before the straightes
of <HI>Sonda,</HI> vnder 9. degrees on the south side of the line. The
sixt of Iuly we put some∣what nearer to the land, and there we saw sixe
or seuen canes lying vnder the shore, but farre off, and durst not 
<PB REF="15"/> make toward vs: in the end we manned out a shalop &amp; rowed
to land, but they made from vs, &amp; when our men were hard by the shore,
there we saw about 40. or 50. of them standing vpon the shore with their
bowes; wherewith our men durst not land, for they seemed to be a cruell
kind of people, and altogether wild, for they went all naked, not hauing any
thing before their priuy members. They were of a reddish colour, but when our
men saw no aduantage they turned again vnto their shippes.</P>
<P>The seuenth of Iuly we saw the point of the land of
<HI>Sumatra,</HI> which is a verie high land descending downe∣warde with a
long end.</P>
<P>The 11. of the same Month we were close vnder the land, where
there lay an Island, and there we ankered.</P>
<P>The 12. of Iuly in the morning we saw certaine ships, whereof
one came vnto vs, wee rowed vnto it with a shalop, and spake with it, but
we could not vnderstand them, but they shewed vs where we should haue
water, which made vs glad, that wee might once againe haue our bellies full of
water: it being almost foure Monthes that wee had not seene any land, nor
taken in any fresh victuailes. We sent our Pinace to the firme land of
<HI>Su∣matra,</HI> there to seeke for some reliefe: for that where we lay
there dwelt not any man.

great solemnitie, hee being apparelled after the Turkish manner, with a
wreath about his heade, and a fearefull countenance, small eyes, great eye
browes, and little beard, for a man might tell all the haires vpon his chinne:
he brought vs a present of Betele, which are leaues which they conti∣nually

<P>This Island of <HI>Sumatra</HI> or <HI>Taprobana</HI> (as it is

the firme land of <HI>Malacca</HI> by a straight and dange∣rous sea, by
reason of many Islandes and cliffes that are within it: Out of this
Island as some men are of opini∣on, <HI>Salomon</HI> had his Gold wherewith
he beautified the Temple, and his owne pallace, and then in the Bible it
should be named <HI>Orphir,</HI> for certainly <HI>Sumatra</HI> is rich of
mynes of Golde, Siluer and Mettall, and the inhabi∣tants therof are very expert
in melting of brasse peeces: Therein is a fountaine of pure Balsame, the
<HI>Portingalles</HI> haue no fortresse therein, yet they traffique in
certaine hauens, specially in <HI>Pedir</HI> and <HI>Campar:</HI> There is
also in this Island a place called <HI>Manancabo,</HI> where they make
poinyardes and daggers, by them calde cryses, which are much esteemed in
those Countries, and those of <HI>Malacca</HI> and <HI>Iaua,</HI> hold them
for their best weapons, and with them are very bold.</P>
<P>The same day our Pinnace returned againe vnto vs, bringing vs good
newes, that wee were welcome vnto the Countrey people, and brought vs certaine
Indian Nuttes, or Cocus, Melons, Cocombers, Onions, Gar∣licke, and a sample

siluer, and other wares that liked him well, he bad vs make towards the

for wee had already beene fifteene Monthes and twelue daies vppon our voyage,
hauing endured great daungers, miseries and thirst, many of our men by

<P>The 23. of Iune wee hoysed our ankers, and went close to the

and that wee had readie mo∣ney, and certaine wares, whereof we shewed him
some parte, which hee liked well, saying that there wee might haue lading
enough, shewing vs great counte∣nance.</P>
<P>The same day likewise there came a great number of scutes vnto
our ships, bringing all kinds of victuailes to sel, as Hennes, Egges,
Cocus, Bonanas, sugar canes, Cakes of Ryce baked, and many other thinges. The
24. of Iune there came many men aborde our ships, bring∣ing diuers wares to
sell, shewing vs great friendshippe, and as it seemed were very glad of
our arriuall there, tel∣ling vs that there we might haue Pepper enough, and new
Pepper within two Months after, and that Pepper was then as good cheap as it
had beene any time with∣in ten yeares before, that wee might buy 5. or 6.
sackes for one Catti, (being about 20. Guilderns) which was ordinarily sold
but one sacke for that price: euery sacke <PB REF="18"/> wayeth 54. pounde
<HI>Hollandes</HI> waight, so that a pounde would be worth about a brasse

borded vs once againe, willing <HI>Cornelis Houtman</HI> to go on land to
speake with the Gouernour, for as then there was no King, for about a Month
before our arriuall there, the King was gone with a great armie before the
towne of <HI>Palimbam,</HI> which hee thought to take, and had almost gotten
it, but there he was striken with a great Peece by a Renigado of the

the straungers that dwelt at <HI>Bantam,</HI> for he was a good king, being
about 25. years of age: he left behind him foure wiues, whereof the el∣dest
was not aboue 15. yeares of age, and a yong sonne of three Monthes olde, that
was to succeed him in his Kingdome, and they had chosen a Protector or
Go∣uernor to rule in his minoritie, whom they call <HI>Kipate,</HI> and when
the <HI>Kipate</HI> by the <HI>Sabandar</HI> sent to our Sarge∣ant Maior to
come vnto him into the towne, he made him answer that he had no such

The towne is almost as great in compasse as the old towne of

of Peeces therein, but they knowe not how to vse them, for they feare them
much: all their Peeces are of brasse, &amp; they haue many brazen bases.
Their walles are not aboue two foote thicke made of brickes: euery flanker hath
di∣uers mastes and peeces of wood, which they vse when they are besieged
by their enemies. The houses are made of straw and reedes, standing vpon
4. woodden postes. The rich haue their chambers all hanged with silken
Curtins, or els with cotton linnen: Their houses are most placed vnder
Cocus trees, whereof the towne is full: Without the walles are many houses,
wherein strangers for the most part haue their dwellinges. The 
<PB N="20" REF="22"/> towne hath three great market places, wherein dayly there
is markets holden, where you may buy all kindes of wares, and where there
commeth a great number of people, very strange to beholde: Within the towne
there is a great church or muske of wood, wherein they obserue the law of
<HI>Mahomet:</HI> Gentlemen &amp; men of any qualitie haue their owne muskes in
their houses. The towne is not built with streetes, nor the houses placed
in order, but very foule lying full of filthy wa∣ter, which men must
passe through, or leape ouer, for they haue no bridges: In the towne there

Pruna, Grapes, Oranges, Lemons, Pomegarnets, Cocombers, Melons, Onions,
Garlicke; but breade they haue none, but in steade of it they eate Ryce:
Beefe is there the dearest victuaile, for an Oxe in that place is worth 7. 8.

hundred toge∣ther, for the which they both buy &amp; sel al kinds of
mar∣chandises, and there they lade Pepper which they car∣rie into
<HI>China:</HI> Without the towne they haue a great place wherein they commonly
vse to sell their wares, and there they dwell, and haue greater and better
hou∣ses then any are within the towne, all made of reedes, onely that in
euery house they haue a square place made of stone, wherein they put
their wares to keepe them from burning, as some riche men in the towne
likewise haue: The <HI>Chinars</HI> are very subtill and indu∣strious
people, and will refuse no labour nor paynes to yearne money, there they make
much Aqua vitae of Ryce and Cocus, and trafficke much therewith, which the
<HI>Iauars</HI> by night come to buy, and drinke it secretly, for by
<HI>Mahomets</HI> law it is forbidden them. The <HI>Chi∣nars</HI> liue there
with free libertie: When they come to remaine there for a yeare or more as they
thinke good, they buy themselues a wife or two, or more as they thinke good,
and liue together like man and wife, and when they meane to depart, they sell
their wiues again, but if they haue children they take them with them, &amp;
so returne to <HI>China:</HI> They haue no special religion, but pray vnto
the Deuill, that he would not hurt them, for they know that the Deuill is
wicked, and that God is good, and hurteth no man, therefore they thinke it
needlesse to pray to God. They acknowledge not the resurrection of the
deade, but when a man dyeth they thinke he neuer riseth again: In their
houses they haue great painted Deuils, before the which they place wax
candles, and sing vnto them, praying them not to hurt them, and the more
monstrous that their shapes be, the <PB N="21" REF="23"/> more they honour
them. These people liue very hard∣ly and poorely within <HI>Bantam,</HI> for
there is not any work or labour how filthy soeuer it be, but they will do it
to get money, and when they haue gotten something they returne again to
<HI>China.</HI> They are verie like Iewes in our countrey, for they neuer goe
without a paire of ballances, and all thinges is good wares with them, and are
ready to do any seruice. When we came first before <HI>Bantam,</HI> they
came euery day in great companies into our shippes, and there set out their

they were in good hope that they shoulde bee put to raunsome, which wee
counselled them to doe as well as they might.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The con∣tents of the Gouer∣nors letter.</NOTE>The
11. of September we had a letter from <HI>Houtman,</HI> and one from the
Gouernour, wherein hee wrote that he would set our men at libertie, so we
would be quiet, but if we desired warre, he woulde once againe come and
visite vs in another sort: wee aunswered him that there he should find
vs, that wordes were but wind, &amp; that he should set our men at a
reasonable ransome, and thereof send vs an answere the next day.</P>
<P>The 12. and 13. of September wee had no answere out of the towne,
and we had want of water, and could get none thereabouts but that which came
out of the towne, for that the Gouernour had taken order that we 
<PB N="25" REF="27"/> should get no water about the towne, so that we
hoised ankers to go seeke some.</P>
<P>The 17. of September we came before 3. or 4. Islands which
<HI>Molenare</HI> and <HI>Shellenger</HI> sayled betweene, and for that the
streame ranne so strong there, they were forced to goe so nigh the
shore, that they might al∣most leape on lande, whereby they escaped great
dan∣ger, but the other shippe and the Pinace sayled about the Islands,
and so met with the other two, and casting forth their ankers went on
shore, where wee spake with men that saide they would shew vs where wee
shoulde haue water, so we would giue them two Caliuers.</P>
<P>The 18. 19. 20. 23. and 24. we stayed to lade water, for it was
hard to get, and we were forced to keep good watch, which done hoysing ankers
againe, wee sayled towardes <HI>Bantam,</HI> holding our course
Eastwarde.</P>
<P>The 27. we sayled Northeast towardes the lande of <HI>Iaua

<P>The 28. setting sayle agayne, we kept East North∣east along
by the coast of <HI>Iaua,</HI> &amp; about noone because of the great
streame that runneth in the straight, wee were forced to anker, and the 30.
day wee set sayle a∣gaine.</P>
<P>The first of October in the euening wee came to a great Islande,
being three miles from the towne, and there we ankered finding good clay
ground.</P>
<P>The 2. of October wee had a letter from our men, how they were
seperated one from the other, and kept by the Gentlemen of the towne, and
their wares parted among them.</P>
<P>The 3. 4. and 5. when wee were againe before the towne, we had other
letters, that by our comming they <PB REF="28"/> were better vsed, and hoped
to bee set at a reasonable ransome, and that they promised that one of
our men should come aborde, so he would returne againe into towne, that
shoulde by worde of mouth certifie vs what hope they were in, and the cause
thereof, that we might the better belieue it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Iaurs vsed our men being

death, and howe they sought all the meanes they coulde to make them to deny
their faith, and become <HI>Mores,</HI> but they remayned constant, and
saide they woulde rather die, and that they had by force shauen three of
our men after the <HI>Morish</HI> manner, and how the <HI>Portingals</HI> had
sought all the meanes they coulde to buy them for slaues, offering money
for them that they might sende them to <HI>Malacca,</HI> how they were set
at libertie againe, &amp; might goe where they woulde within the towne, and
so they hoped all would be well, and that they shoulde bee set at
libertie for some small ransome, and that the Gouernour asked them 3000.
Rialles of 8. but they hoped to bring him to 2000. whereat we much
reioy∣ced.</P>
<P>The 8. 9. and 10. of October we passed ouer to make some
agreement with them that we might be quiet.</P>
<P>The 11. of October they agreede vppon a ransome of 2000. Ryalles
of eyght, and were content, that what goodes soeuer we had taken from them,
wee shoulde keepe as our owne, and for our goodes that they had stolen, and
forcibly taken from our men within the <PB N="26" REF="28"/> towne, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The maner of their ran∣some.</NOTE>they would
keepe them, and so exchange one for the other, they likewise were content
to quit vs of all our debts, that we ought within the towne eyther to the
Gouernor or to any other man, and that from thence forwarde we should be
free, and traffique in the towne, both to buy and sell when it pleased vs,
&amp; with their good willes as we had done, and before we paide our money, the
towne was to sende two men aborde our ships, which done, we were to pay the
halfe of our ransome, and vpon the payment thereof, they shoulde set
halfe of our men at liberty, and that halfe of our men being come aborde, wee
were to pay the other halfe of our ransome, which was 1000. Ryalles of eyght;
which being performed, their two men, and their other halfe of our men were on

was perfor∣med.</P>
<P>The 12. and 13. this agreement being ended, diuers victuailers came

<P>The 14. we gaue certaine presentes in signe of good will, to

<P>The 15. 16. 17. and 18. some of our Factors went into the towne,
where they bought certaine Pepper, &amp; brought it abord our ships.</P>
<P>The 19. they went again into the towne, &amp; bought a greater
quantitie at 5. sackes for one Catti, minding in that sorte euery day to
take in our lading, but it fell not out as wee desired, for the

the Gouer∣nour, that he gaue commandement that we should buy <PB REF="29"/> no
more Pepper, before we had paide 1400. Rialles of 8. which he challenged of vs
because we had cast anker within his streame, whereupon our Marchantes
went and agreed with him, which done wee thinking to buy Pepper as we did
before, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the Gouernor forbad vs trafficke.</NOTE>the

solde their Pepper, as also the <HI>Chinars, Arabians, Mahometitians,</HI>
and secretly some <HI>Portingalles,</HI> but when we saw wee could not
get it out but with great daunger, wee thought it not conuenient to buy: and
when we spake vnto the Gouernour, tou∣ching the holding of his worde, he made
vs answere, that he had no bones in his tongue, and that therefore he could
speake that which he ment not to doe: and to say the truth most part of

<P>The 25. of October there came an Ambassador into

of 10000. Rials of 8. desiring him to forbid vs both his towne and streame,
that wee might not traffique there. Whereof wee were aduertised by the
<HI>Sabandar</HI> and other of our friendes counselling our men to get them
out of the towne, and not to returne again, other∣wise they would be in
daunger to be stayed againe, and we hauing sent a man into the towne to
saue him from being holden prisoner, our host where we lay being on
shore was forced to bring him out couered with cer∣taine mattes; so that
vppon the 26. of the same month all our trafficke and friendship with them
ceased: but our hoast being our friende, came secretly aborde our

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They fought with a Iauan shippe.</NOTE>The 2.
of Nouember we espyed a shippe that came toward <HI>Bantam,</HI> which we
ioyned vnto with our boats, and being neere vnto it, they spread their
fights, which were of thicke mattes, and began to defend themselues; our men
shot among them with stone peeces and Ca∣liuers, and they defended
themselues with great cou∣rage, <PB REF="30"/> hauing halfe pikes wherewith
they thrust at vs, &amp; that serued likewise to blow arrowes out of
them, for they were like trunkes, out of the which trunkes they shot so
great numbers of arrowes, that they fell as thick as hayle, and shotte so
certainely, that therewith they hurt at the least eyght or nine of our men,
but the ar∣rowes are thinne and light, so that their blaste coulde not make
them enter into the flesh aboue the thicknes of two fingers, onely the head
of the arrowe (which is made of reede, and loose stayeth in the flesh)
when we shot with our Caliuers they runne behind their fightes, but whē they
perceiued that their matted fights could not defende them, and that they were
killed through them, they entered into their boate, and by strength of oares
rowed from vs, leauing their shippe, wherein we founde two dead men, and we
slew three more of them as we rowed after their boat, so that in all they
lost fiue men, as we after heard, and that they were to the num∣ber of 40.
which done, wee brought their shippe to ours, wherein we found good store
of Ryce and dryed fish.</P>
<P>The 6. of Nouember, perceyuing not any hope of more trafficke for vs

they were sory for our departure, &amp; that they longed for our returne
againe.</P>
<P>The thirteenth of Nouember wee set sayle, and a∣bout 
<PB N="28" REF="30"/> euening wee came before <HI>Iacatra,</HI> in time past
called <HI>Sunda Calapa,</HI> which hath beene a rich Towne of marchandise,
but vppon some occasions, and by rea∣son of their hard vsage the
Marchants had withdrawen themselues from thence, therefore at this present
there is little or nothing to doe. <HI>Iohn Hughen</HI> in his booke saith
this to be the principal towne of trafficke, but that is long sithence, for
now there is not any trade of mar∣chandise.</P>
<P>The fourteenth of Nouember wee sent two of our men into the towne,
hauing some of theirs in pawne, who tolde vs that many of the inhabitantes
were gone out of the towne with all their goodes, being in great feare of our
peeces, and there wee had great store of victuailes, and much more then wee
required brought abord our ships.</P>
<P>The 18. wee set saile from <HI>Iacatra,</HI> and being about two

cliffe, but it got off againe without any hurt, and therewith wee presently
made towardes the straight.</P>
<P>The 2. of December we passed by 3. townes which we might
easily perceiue, we likewise passed by <HI>Tubam,</HI> and ankered
vnder <HI>Sidaya.</HI> The 3. of December there came men out of the towne,
&amp; desired vs to stay, saying that there we might haue Cloues &amp;

certayne birde that coulde swallowe <PB REF="31"/> fyer, which is a very
strange fowle, and was brought a∣liue to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> which after
was giuen to the states of <HI>Hollande</HI> lying in the <HI>Hage,</HI> and
some good fruites, willing vs to sende a man on shore to see their
spices, whereof they said they had great store: wherevpon we sent a man
out of the <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and with him an inter∣preter, one of the
<HI>Portingalles</HI> slaues, they leauing three or foure of their men aborde
our shippes, for pawnes till his returne: when our man came to lande hee was
well vsed, and there they shewed him fortie or fiftie bals of Cloues; which
done they brought him before the King, that promised him great fauor, and
told him that the next day he wold himselfe come aborde our ships, and
deale with our Captaines, and with that he let our man depart.</P>
<P>The 5. of December we expected the Kinges com∣ming aborde, putting
out all our flagges and streamers, and about noone there came 8. or 9.
indifferent great shippes full of men from off the shore, wherein wee
thought the King to bee, but when they were almost at vs they diuided
themselues, three of them rowing to <HI>Shellengers</HI> ship, and when

<HI>Ia∣uers</HI> entering all at once, <HI>Reymer van Hel</HI> said, What
will all these people doe aborde the shippe, for there was at the least
two hundred men, who all at one time drewe out their poinyardes, and stabbed
our men that neuer suspected them, so that presently they had slaine
twelue of the shippe, and two sore wounded, that boldly with∣stoode them:
the rest of our men being vnder hatches presently tooke their pikes, and
thrust so fast out at the <PB N="29" REF="31"/> grates, 
<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Indians be∣trayed thē.</NOTE>that the
<HI>Iauers</HI> woulde haue forced the middle part of the ship, wherein was

them out, not ceasing still to thrust vp with their pikes, meane time
they kindled fier, lighted their matches, &amp; shot off their stone peeces
that lay aboue the hatches, wherwith they began presently to flie, most of
them lea∣ping ouer bord, and swam to their two boates, that lay harde by our
shippes, whereof one with a great peece was presently striken in peeces:
The rest of our ships hearing vs shoote in that manner, entered into
their boats, and made towardes them, rowing harde to the three <HI>Indian</HI>
fustes, wherein were at the least 100. men, and shotte among them with
their peeces, wherewith they leapt into the water, euery man swimming to
shore, and we with two boates after them, hewing and killing them as our
deadly enemies, who vnder pre∣tence of friendshippe sought to murther vs,
and wee handled them in such sort, that of two hundred men there got not
aboue thirty of them to lande, the rest of their fustes lay farre off and
beheld the fight: Three of their fustes thought to rowe to the Pinace to take
her, which they might easily haue done, as hauing not a∣boue 7. or 8. men in
her, being busie to set vppe a newe maste, but when they perceyued their
men to bee so handeled in the <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> and that they leapt ouer
borde, they turned backe againe, and in great haste ro∣wed to land, so that
at that time they got not much by the bargaine, and no small griefe to vs,
for there wee lost 12. men, that were all stabbed with poinyards, their
names were <HI>Iohn Iacobson Schellenger,</HI> maister of the ship,

<P>The 6. of December we came to a great Island cal∣led

aborde our shippes, with message from their Gouernour, saying that we
were welcome, desiring vs to stay there, for he would trafficke with vs,

<P>The 7. of December there came another boat abord, bringing certaine
fruites, saying that the next day their Gouernour would come to see our
shippes.</P>
<P>The 8. there came a great fuste and three smal boats, from off
the land all full of men, saying their Gouernor was among them: we willed
them not to goe to the <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> but to the <HI>Mauritius,</HI> but
they woulde not, but made to the <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> thinking because there
had beene so many murthered in her, there was not ma∣ny men aborde her at
that time, and when they were within a pykes length of her, (although they were
di∣rected to the other shippes) they remembring their late mischance,
shotte off three or foure stone Peeces full laden, wherewith they slew
and hurt many of the <PB N="30" REF="32"/> <HI>Indians,</HI> wherevpon they
presently leapt ouer bord, &amp; wee with our boates followed after and
slew diuers of them, taking ten or twelue, thinking by them to know what
their intent was to doe, but they coulde not cer∣tifie vs, and therefore we let
them go againe onely kee∣ping two boyes, who long after stole out of the
shippe, and swamme to lande: They tolde vs that the Gouer∣nour being a
Bishoppe or chiefe instructor of the coun∣trey, was within the boate and
slaine among the rest, hee had therein likewise a little boy one of his

<P>About euening we hoysed ankers, &amp; set sayle, &amp; the 11.

because wee had already indured a long and troublesome voyage, and but ill

<P>The 18. of Ianuary we entered into the straight that runneth

ground.</P>
<P>The 19. wee set sayle, and when wee came neere to the coast of

backeward, as swiftly as an arrow out of a bow, and there we found no anker

<P>The 20. of Ianuarie wee went and lay by our other ships.</P>
<P>The 21. of Ianuarie there came two barkes to the <HI>Mauritius,</HI>

vs that the towne of <HI>Balla∣boam</HI> was besieged by a strange King,
that had marryed the King of <HI>Ballaboams</HI> daughter, and after he had
laine with her he caused her to bee slaine, and then came to besiege her
father. This towne of <HI>Ballaboam</HI> lyeth on the East end of the
Island of <HI>Iaua,</HI> and is the same towne where M. <HI>Candish</HI>
was when hee passed that way, and the old King wherof he writeth was as
then yet liuing, being at the least 160. years of age. There we saw great
numbers of Battes, that flew ouer our shippes, and were as bigge as Crowes,
which in that Countrey they vse to eat, as they say: About noone we came
before the towne of <HI>Ballaboam,</HI> so neare vnto it that we might
easi∣ly see it, and there we lay behind a high point of lande, thinking to

<P>The 22. of Ianuarie we tooke our Pinace, and sayled <PB REF="34"/>
about the shore as neere the land as possible we might, to seeke for
fresh water, but we found none, for the Ri∣uer that ran through the towne was
paled vp (by them that lay before it) so that no man might passe either
out or in, but onely on the lande side, and that with great daunger: The
same day there came 2. or 3. men abord our shippe, that stole out of the
towne by night, and came from the King, to desire our help with our great
shot, which wee coulde not doe; because that therea∣bouts it was very
shallow, and we might not go neere it with our shippes: they tolde vs they
had great want of victuailes within the towne, whereby many of them were
already deade for hunger, and much desired our aide, but it was not in vs to
doe. Those that besieged the towne were <HI>Mores,</HI> but they in the
towne were hea∣thens, and as yet had not receyued <HI>Mahomets</HI> lawe, and
that (as wee heard after) was the cause of their warre: There wee sawe many
Storkes flying and sitting in the fielde: with vs we cannot imagaine where
the Storkes remaine in winter time, but here wee sawe them in the winter
time.</P>
<P>The 24. of Ianuarie we sayled from thence, percey∣uing nothing for

<P>The 26. of Ianuarie our Pinace sent her boat to land, to see the

he found nothing, but an armie of ten thousand men, that ment to relieue the

worth to lade water, wherevpon our men came on borde a∣gaine: Their Generall
thought to haue gotten some great pray out of our shippes.</P>
<P>The 27. of Ianuarie we set sayle to finde a conueni∣ent place to
refresh vs with water and other prouision, for wee were informed by a man
of <HI>Bengala,</HI> that of his owne will sayled with vs, and that had beene
in <HI>Bally,</HI> that there wee should finde water and other thinges to
serue our necessities, so that by night wee ankered vn∣der a high
pointe of lande on the South west ende of <HI>Bally.</HI></P>
<P>The 28. of Ianuary one of their boates borded vs with sixe or
seuen men, saying that their King was de∣sirous to deale with vs for
such wares as hee had, and sent to know from whence we came, and we saide
wee came out of <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>The 29. and 30. there came more men aborde our shippes, but as wee
suspected that was not the right ha∣uen, for the people came rowing in
great haste a far off, and the man of <HI>Bengala</HI> could not tell what to
say, but the King was thereabout, and euery day sent vs some fruit.</P>
<P>The first of February wee had two hogges brought aborde our

sauerly.</P>
<P>The 2. of Februarie, we set saile that wee might get aboue the

reason the winde was contrary, wee coulde not doe it, but were forced to
an∣ker againe.</P>
<P><PB REF="35"/>The <HI>3.</HI> of February we set saile againe,
and then wee had a storme, so that our saile blew euery way, and
be∣cause of the contrarie winde we could not reach aboue the point, but were
constrained to anker, but the <HI>Mau∣ritius</HI> and the Pinace got past
it, although thereby the <HI>Mauritius</HI> was in no little daunger; but
because the Pi∣lot had laid a wager of 6. Rialles of 8. that hee woulde get
aboue it, hee would passe, what daunger soeuer it might be, and sayled
close along by the cliffes, where∣by wee lay at anker without companie.</P>
<P>The 4. and 5. wee set saile once againe to get aboue the point
but could not reach it.</P>
<P>The 6. we had a letter from <HI>Rodenburgh,</HI> that certifi∣ed vs
how the <HI>Mauritius</HI> lay at anker at the least 7. or 8. miles beyond
the point, and he that brought the letter came with it ouer land; and at the
same time there was a man sent on lande with a small present for the
King, that we might winne his fauour.</P>
<P>The 7. our man came on borde againe, and brought vs newes how
<HI>Rodenburgh</HI> with one of the <HI>Portingalles</HI> slaues, being on

the <HI>Mauritius</HI> had got∣ten men for pledges.</P>
<P>The 8. of Ianuarie, the same man went on land out of our shippe
with more presentes of veluet and a cali∣uer, the better to get the Kinges
fauour, which liked him well, and desired vs to bring the ship nearer to
the towne, saying he would send vs water and other things sufficient to
supply our wants.</P>
<P>The 9. we sayled into the cheeke with our shippe, &amp; ankered
about a small halfe mile from the land, &amp; being ankered there came at the
least 70. boates of the Coun∣trie <PB N="33" REF="35"/> to see our ship,
and the King sent vs word that hee was desirous to heare vs shoote off 5.
or 6. of our great peeces, wherevppon wee shot fiue of our greatest
pee∣ces, and the King stoode vppon the shore to see them.</P>
<P>The 10. we had a letter from <HI>Cornelis Houtman,</HI> to wil vs to
come to them, for that there they had founde a good place for water, and of all
other necessaries, so that about euening wee set sayle, leauing two
of our men and a <HI>Portingall</HI> slaue among the <HI>Indians,</HI> whome
the King promised should come vnto vs ouer land, yet that night wee could
not reach aboue the point, meane time we perceyued our Pinace that came to
helpe vs.</P>
<P>The 16. we got by the <HI>Mauritius,</HI> that had already laden in
her water, and hooped her vessels, wherevpon we began presently to do the
like, and to visite our ves∣sels that were almost spoyled.</P>
<P>The 17. our men whome wee left with the King came ouer land vnto our
shippes, and then we bought great store of cattle and fruit.</P>
<P>The 18. 19. 20. and 21. wee imployed our time to lade water, which
wee had verie easily, and refreshed our selues with Cattle, Hogges,
fruit, and Lemons suf∣ficient. There came one of the Kinges principall
offi∣cers with our men ouer land, to pleasure vs in all things we desired,
he was very desirous to haue some present of vs.</P>
<P>The 22. of Ianuarie two of our men that sayled in the
<HI>Mauritius</HI> stayed on lande, but wee knewe not the cause: it
should seeme some great promises had beene made vnto them, for as we
vnderstoode, the King was very desirous to haue all sortes of strange

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two of our men stayed with the

<P>The 23. 24. and 25. we made a voyage on land, and fetcht as many

<P>The 25. of Februarie we hoysed ankers, minding to set saile
