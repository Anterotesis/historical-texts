<HEAD><HI>At the Court at</HI> White-Hall, <HI>the</HI> 4th. <HI>of</HI> August, 1676.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Present, The KING'S Most Excellent Majesty in Council.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P><HI>The Right Honourable the Lords of the Committee of Trade did this Day present unto his Majesty in Council, a Report touching the Injuries which his Subjects did sustain by the</HI> French Capers, <HI>in the Words following.</HI></P>
</HEADNOTE>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Majesty,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THere was presented unto your Majesty in Council, on the 31st. of <HI>May</HI> last, a Peti∣tion in the Name of all the Merchants of <HI>London,</HI> and other Places, concerned in the seve∣ral Ships Taken by the <HI>French Privateers,</HI> and carried into several Ports of that Kingdom; And their Complaints consisted of the Points follow∣ing.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Ship and Goods of your Subjects though Manned according to the Act of Navi∣gation, and furnished with all necessary Passes,
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>were daily seized carried into <HI>Dunkirk, Calais, Sherbrook,</HI> and other Ports, the Masters and Mar∣riners kept close Prisoners, to force them by hard∣ship to abuse their Owners, or else for Reliefe of their own necessityes (being commonly striped and plundered) to enter into the Privateers service, which great numbers have done, with very pernitious effects.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the delay and charg of Prosecuting the Law in <HI>France,</HI> does commonly make the Own∣ers to become Loosers of halfe the Value, when ever they are most Successful.</P>
<P N="3">3. That there is no Reparation ever gotten from Privateers, for what they plunder and im∣bezzle, which makes them freely seize upon all they meet, and perpetually molest the Navigation of your Subjects.</P>
<P>Wherefore, your Petitioners humbly implor∣ing your Majesties Protection and releife, Your Majesty was hereupon graciously pleased, out of a Sense of your Subjects sufferings, to command that some Frigats should saile forth to cleare the Coast of those Privateers, to seize them, and bring such as had offended to make Restitution. And your Majesty did further Or∣der, That the Committee of Trade, should as well take notice of the particular Cases and Com∣plaints depending, that such of them as were of
<PB REF="6"/>Weight and Merit, might be fitted to receive your most gracious Recommendation for Re∣liefe, as to Survey, the whole number of Seiz∣zures, which have been made on your Subjects, in Order to lay before your Majesty what hard∣ship have been susteyned at Sea, and what sort of Justice hath been administred in <HI>France,</HI> with their opinions of what is fit to advise your Ma∣jesty therein.</P>
<P>In Obedience to which Command, we have hereunto annexed a List of such Ships as have been seized, to the Number of 53. And the Cases wherein the Owners have repaired unto your Ma∣jesty, either in your Council, or by your Secre∣tary of State for Relief. Which, as in the general it supposes a Justice in such Complaints, so, it leaves a suspicion of great hardship in the Me∣thods of Redress. And the number of Captures is no small proof of the facility of Condem∣nation.</P>
<P>How many other helpless men there have been (besides the said Cases) who have not had ability to prosecute, or how many of these Cases have been favoured with Redresse, we cannot cer∣tainly understand, till the Information we have sought for, come from <HI>Paris,</HI> which may also en∣able us to compleat their circumstances of every Case.</P>
<PB REF="7"/>
<P>But in the mean time, such of all the Instan∣ces of Redresse, as are come to our knowledge, we have not failed, in the <HI>Margine,</HI> to make men∣tion of them, being in number Seven.</P>
<P>While we were in the mid'st of this Prosecu∣tion, Mr. Secretary <HI>Coventry,</HI> does on the sixth instant, present unto the Committee a Paper, which he received from the <HI>French</HI> Embassador, Monsieur <HI>Courtin,</HI> relating to these matters, and the Contents thereof were as follow.</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng"><BODY><DIV1 TYPE="extract from letter">
<HEADNOTE>
<P>An Extract of a Letter from Monsieur <HI>Colbert</HI> to Monsieur <HI>d' Pompone,</HI> written the 28th. of <HI>June,</HI> 1676.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<P><HI>FOR what concerns the Prizes it would be a difficult matter to Answer to all the Cases con∣tained in Monsieur</HI> Courtin's <HI>Letter; What I can say, is,</HI></P>
<P><HI>That the Council for</HI> Marine Affairs, <HI>Sits every</HI> Friday <HI>at St.</HI> Germans.</P>
<P><HI>That all</HI> Privateers <HI>and</HI> Reclaimers <HI>know it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That Sir</HI> Ellis Leighton, <HI>nominated by the</HI> Eng∣lish <HI>Embassador hath alwayes notice of it, and is all∣wayes present at it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That not a Week passes, but I give him two or three Audiences, and oftentimes I send for him on purpose.</HI></P>
<PB REF="7"/>
<P><HI>His Reasons are all Reported, Read and Exami∣ned.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As likewise are all Petitions of</HI> Reclaimers, <HI>and I shall tell you more, I acquaint him with the Reasons upon which Judgement is given.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In giving Judgement all Vessells which have any Ap∣pearance of being</HI> English <HI>are Releast, and very often, and almost alwayes, although we are satisfyed that the Ships are</HI> Dutch, <HI>yet they are released because there is some appearance of their being</HI> English; <HI>And every thing is Judged favourably for that Nation; And it is true that all Ships that are taken are of</HI> Dutch <HI>built; That they never were in</HI> England; <HI>that the Masters and all the equipage are</HI> Dutch; <HI>That the Documents are for persons unknown, and which are not oftentimes so wuch as named; That they carry with them onely some Sea briefes from</HI> Waterford <HI>or some other Towne of</HI> Ireland <HI>or</HI> Stotland; <HI>That the whole Ships Com∣pany Deposes, they were sent to</HI> Holland; <HI>That we have found on Board three or four Vessells, Bills of Accompts, by which is seen the</HI> English <HI>take two three and four,</HI> Per Cent. <HI>For Owning of Ships; And although it is impossible to avoid confiscateing them, yet these are the Ships which make such a noise in</HI> Eng∣land.</P>
</DIV1></BODY></TEXT></Q>
<P>In Answer to which <HI>Remarques;</HI> though it be true that all respect imaginable ought to be given to what Ministers of that Consideration do pro∣nounce,
<PB REF="8"/>Yet there being some difference be∣tween them who feel the smart, and those who feel it not; we shall insist on some particulars, that your Majesty may discerne whether your Subjects are so fortunate in their freedome of Trade at Sea, or in the helps of Justice when they are seized, as the Report and Information of the Letter would seem to make out. For as it magni∣fyes the favour which is exercised in <HI>France,</HI> the facility in all Addresses, and the tendernesse to releive <HI>English</HI> men in all Complaints, so we cannot on this Subject but owne to your Majesty the very different Resentments we have thereof, for we understand that when <HI>English</HI> Ships are brought into the <HI>Ports</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> many of the Marriners complaining of ill Treatment, and some of Torment, their Papers being seized and their Persons in restraint, till all Examinations are prepared, Then are all the Writings sent up to the Privy Council at St. <HI>Germans,</HI> and there Judgment definitively given; Seldome are any of the reasons of Condemnation mentioned in the Decree, and never any Appeal or Revision admitted of (So at least it was until the 20th of <HI>June</HI> last) And whether this be the tendernesse or the Justice which is mentioned we do not know; But we are well assured, that the Methods of your Majesty Clemency, and Justice on like oc∣casions,
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>have been far otherwise. And we ap∣peal to the present Embassador, Monsieur <HI>Cour∣tin,</HI> if almost in all Cases, that he or any other of the Embassadors thought fit to own (when his Excellency was here before, and your Majesty in War with <HI>Holland,</HI> seizing many Ships as Prize, and under great suspicion claimed by the <HI>French</HI>) whether it were not very customary, to have a short Reference, and a summary Examination of all Papers by the Judge of the Admiralty in his Chamber, and that if any thing appeared fair in the Case, whether the Ships were not immedi∣ately Released without Law, charge or delay? And 'twil not be out of season, we hope, to annex hereunto the Copy of an Order of the 22th. of <HI>July</HI> 1665, Signed by the then Lords Commissi∣oners of Prizes, where it will appear, That <HI>Eigh∣teen French Ships</HI> (which were Laden with Wine and Brandy) being at <HI>Dover,</HI> and detained as Prize, were all <HI>Eighteen</HI> by one Order discharg∣ed, without any Law, or even the Ceremony of the Judges Examination, being singly on the Credit of the Embassadors Word, affirming that they belonged unto the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>And as for the matter of <HI>Revisions</HI> or <HI>Appeals,</HI> after Sentence in the Court of Admiralty here; We know his Excellency will also remember, that never any man was denied his liberty there∣in,
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>but on the contrary, your Majesty gave a standing Commission for Appeals in all Cases of Prizes, and filled it with the Lords of your Council only, that every Case might receive a candid a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> well as unquestionable determina∣tion.</P>
<P>We might also put your Majesty in mind that during the whole terme of your late League with <HI>France,</HI> when ever any <HI>French</HI> Ships were seized by the <HI>Hollander,</HI> and afterwards retaken by his Majesties Frigats, such <HI>French</HI> Ships were allwayes restored on demand, no consideration being had of the time they were in possession of the <HI>Hollander,</HI> Whether a Month, two, or three as some times they were, and when the <HI>French</HI> owner as it hath happened knew not of such re∣taking, but that the Ship was according to Law, condemned to your Majesty and sould with o∣ther Prizes, yet the Claimer appearing, your Majesty hath ordered the Mony and product of the Ships to be restored unto him.</P>
<P>Such Various Methods of Justice and of Clemency, might have entituled your Majesty to a different acknowledgment, and more advan∣tageous effects.</P>
<P>As to the other part of the said Paper, It seems to containe very harsh imputations on the Trade of your Majesties Subjects, and from some ill
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>practice perhaps found out (as every where there may be Instances of the like) General Rules are made, and severe Impressions taken, which have∣ing entred the thoughs of some eminent Ministers we must not wonder (how frequent and how multiplyed soever your Majesties Recommenda∣tions for Justice are) that the Events of Tryalls prove so unfortunate, If your Mujesty will but Vouchsafe to cast your Eye on the Cases here annext, You will soon see.</P>
<P>Whether (as is imputed) all the Ships taken are <HI>Dutch</HI> built?</P>
<P>Whether they are all such as never were in <HI>England?</HI></P>
<P>Whether all the Masters and all the Marriners are <HI>Dutch?</HI></P>
<P>VVhether the Documents be for persons un∣known and oftentimes not named.</P>
<P>VVhether in the whole List there be more then one Ship from <HI>Waterford</HI> and but six from the rest of all <HI>Ireland,</HI> but from <HI>Scotland</HI> not so much as one?</P>
<P>VVhether tis credible all the Ships Company do swear they are sent to <HI>Holland</HI> when so many are taken even comming from <HI>Holland?</HI></P>
<P>Your Majesty may see how many Ships in the List are <HI>English</HI> built taken with <HI>English</HI> Colours, <HI>English Marriners, English</HI> Owners, some of them
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>known to your Majesty, and to whom the best Papers your Majesty or your Ministers can signe or the Treaties do require, are given, but all in vain.</P>
<P>So that if the Case be in the General quite dif∣ferent from what in the General is represented we hope it will be no crime for your Majesties Subjects to make some Noise in <HI>England,</HI> when they are hurt and when they see their goods taken from them by Violence, and that Violence rather Justifyed then redrest by Law.</P>
<P>Tis not for the Condemnation past on those very ill cases ennumerated that your Subjects do complain, for it were to their Advantage if all such were Punished and deterred from Trade, who by collusion take share in that Profit which the favour of the present conjuncture seems wholly to appropriate to this Kingdom.</P>
<P>And surely your Majesty and the whole King∣dome did reckon upon this advantage, and the Extent of Trade that would naturally slow in as one of the greatest friuts and blessings of your peace, so that your Majesty being sensible of great decay and losse of <HI>English</HI> trading Ships in the late War, did think it advisable to admit your Subjects to repaire themselves on the sudden by purchasing of forraigne Ships, and your Majesty by your Authority made them free, and fit to
<PB N="13" REF="10"/>partake in the benefit of <HI>English</HI> Ships, to the diminution of those higher Customes, which otherwise such Ships were obliged to pay. And while your Subjects with these and with their own home built Ships are in prosecution of the said Advantages, while every man is invited by the Conjuncture to venture more and to inlarge his Trade, while by a general trust in the peace and allyance your Majesty holds with all your Neighbours round about, they are lead to go abroad unarmed and without defence, we cannot but lament it as a great misfortune and disap∣pointment to observe how these your Majesties Subjects are frequently made a Prey of and very evilly treated both at Sea and Land.</P>
<P>Wherefore considering that the Root of all this disorder arises from the violence and rapine of the <HI>French</HI> Capers, who ought to be looked on as disturbers of the publick quiet, and Enemies to the good freindship between the two Crowns, We are humbly of opinion, That your Majesty has just occasion from the Injuryes past, and those which are now depending and which do every day increase, to make a very serious representa∣tion of all unto his most Christian Majesty; And not only presse for some better method of repair∣ing the grievances mentioned, But earnestly to insist on the calling in of all Privateers. Or else
<PB N="14" REF="11"/>your Majesty must do <HI>Right,</HI> and give <HI>Defence</HI> to your Subjects from all the <HI>Insolencies</HI> which they so frequently meet;</P>
