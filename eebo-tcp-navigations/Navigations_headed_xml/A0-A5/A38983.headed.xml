<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Die Martis, <HI>23.</HI> April, <HI>1695.</HI></DATE> In the <HI>Exchequer-Chamber.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AT the Committee of both Houses, appointed to hear and examine Sir <HI>Tho. Cooke,</HI> in pursuance of the Act, intituled, <HI>An Act to indemnifie Sir</HI> Thomas Cooke <HI>from Actions which he might be liable to, by reason of his discovering to whom he paid and distributed several sums of money therein men∣tioned, to be received out of the Treasure of the</HI> East India <HI>Company; or for any prosecution for such distribution.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="deposition">
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Cooke</HI> being called in, and the Act read, he thereupon observed to the said Committee some∣thing relating to the Clause touching his imprison∣ment; and did desire, that in case he should then make a full and perfect discovery, to the satisfaction of the Committee, it might by them be represented to each House, so as he might obtain their Votes for his discharge; he apprehending by the Act, that no per∣son is impowered to release him in Case of such discovery. Whereupon the Committee acquainted him, <HI>That they were of Opinion, if he made a full dis∣covery, he would not be liable to the Penalty of that Act; but however, his scruple should he fairly represented to both Houses.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Cook</HI> being sworn, acquainted the Com∣mittee, <HI>That for their ease he had put his Confession down in writing;</HI> a Copy whereof is hereunto annex∣ed.</P>
<P>The Original being read by him, and the Com∣mittee conceiving it to be imperfect, and not such as the Act requires, the Committee let him know, <HI>That they expected a more particular account of those matters from him.</HI></P>
<P>To the first Sum of 10000 l. mentioned in the said writing, he saith, the same was payed to Mr. <HI>Tyson</HI> in <HI>November</HI> 1692.</P>
<P>That he gave him no Directions how it should be disposed; but it was in expectation to have the Char∣ter of the <HI>East India</HI> Company confirmed, and New Regulations thereto made; and they concluded it for the service of the Company. It was intended for the service of the King, but he could not say the King had it.</P>
<P>He believes the <HI>East India</HI> Company never had any account how this 10000 l. was disposed. He told the Court, as he remembers, <HI>That he had disposed of the mo∣ney, and they required no account thereof.</HI></P>
<P>He believes Mr. <HI>Tyson</HI> told him, that he delivered it to Sir <HI>Josias Child,</HI> who delivered it to the King. He saith, 'tis a Customary Present, and that in King <HI>Charles</HI>'s and other former Reigns the like had been done for se∣veral Years, which by the books of the Company may appear.</P>
<P>That the Company, when this Present was made, were in an ill condition; That he himself advanced this sum, and had it not repaid in 4 or 5 months time; the same, with the interest thereupon due, was presented to the King in Tallies.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="2"/>
<P>As to the 10000 l. and 2000 l. next mentioned in the Account, he saith, those sums were paid to Mr. <HI>Richard Acton</HI> about the same time; who declared he had several Friends capable of doing great service to the Companies Affairs; and several of them would speak with parliament-men; That he could not par∣ticularize who they were, but the end aim'd at, was to get an <HI>Act of Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Cook</HI> offer'd to give the Company an Ac∣count how the mony was disposed of, but they did not think fit to receive it. And further saith, That he knows no man, besides Mr. <HI>Acton,</HI> who can give an Account who had that mony. That he intrusted this mony wholly with Mr. <HI>Acton,</HI> taking him for an <HI>honest</HI> and <HI>able man,</HI> the Court having given him Power (as he conceiv'd) to dispose of the mony by another hand, as well as by his own.</P>
<P>That the inducements for giving this mony, were fears of the <HI>Interlopers</HI> going out, and <HI>Subscriptions for a New Company going on,</HI> by which they <HI>apprehended pany would be ruin'd.</HI></P>
<P>That to the best of his Remembrance, there was a Bill at that time for another <HI>East-India Company;</HI> and that the King had sent a <HI>Message to the House of Com- the Commons</HI> to settle the <HI>East-India Trade.</HI></P>
<P>That this 10000 l. was Advanced by <HI>Acton</HI> himself, and not repayed him in some Months after, which <HI>mony,</HI> he believes, <HI>Acton</HI> paid away the same <HI>Session;</HI> the other 2000 l. to <HI>Acton,</HI> was for <HI>Interest</HI> and his <HI>Pains</HI> and <HI>Expences,</HI> which were great.</P>
<P><HI>Acton</HI> did say he could tell some Persons imployed in that <HI>Affair,</HI> he did understand that this Money was to be laid out <HI>for promoting their Affairs in Parliament,</HI> could not say to whom it was given, but understood <HI>it went no furnher than the House of Commons,</HI> and that he found no <HI>good Fruit by such Distribution.</HI></P>
<P>That Mr. <HI>Acton</HI> at that time had an <HI>interest in the East-India Company,</HI> to the value of 10 or 20000 l. as he believes, and had so for some time.</P>
<P>That he gave this 10000 <HI>l.</HI> with the Privity of Sir <HI>Jesias Child,</HI> who recommended <HI>Acton</HI> as a Person ca∣pable of doing the <HI>Company Service,</HI> having <HI>great Ac∣quaintance with Parliament Men, and others who had in∣terest with them.</HI></P>
<P>That he knows not who <HI>Acton</HI> Employed in the <HI>di∣stribution of this Mony.</HI></P>
<P>As to the 338 l. 7. s. 6 d. mentioned to be paid to Mr. <HI>Molineaux,</HI> he saith, the same was paid him about the same time the money was paid to Mr. <HI>A∣cton;</HI> That Mr. <HI>Molineaux</HI> told him, <HI>this money was to be disp sed of to the Lord</HI> Rivers; but further saith, <HI>that since his confinement</HI> Molineaux <HI>had been with him, to tell him, that it was a w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng thing; that my Lord ne∣ver had it; that he had made use of it himself.</HI></P>
<P>As to the farther Sum of 250 l. mentioned in the said Paper, to be paid Mr. <HI>Tyson,</HI> for the service of the <HI>Company;</HI> he saith, <HI>it was paid him about the same time, and was in relation to</HI> Salt Petre, <HI>but he cannot give a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> further Account thereof.</HI></P>
<P>As to the 220l. mention'd to be paid to Sir <HI>John Chardin,</HI> he believes it was for his own use, having ex∣pended great sums in the Companies service.</P>
<P>As to the 350l. paid to Mr. <HI>Dockminique,</HI> he saith, <HI>He believes the same was Expended by him, but he knows, not to whom he gave it.</HI></P>
<P>As to the 382 l. 1 s. 8 d. paid to Capt. <HI>Jermain,</HI> he saith; <HI>That Mr.</HI> Jermain <HI>told him he had lost</HI> 700 l. <HI>in the Interest of the Interlopers, who finding that Interest to decline, applied himself to him, the said Sir</HI> Thomas Cook, <HI>proposing that if he might have half the monies, which he had lost, repaid him, he would come into the</HI> East-India Company's <HI>Interest,</HI> upon which consideration the said 382 l. 1 s. 8 d. was paid him.</P>
<P>As to the 1091. l. 13 s. 4 d. paid to Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> Deceas'd, he saith, <HI>That</HI> Fitzpatrick <HI>told him he had a great Interest with the Lord</HI> Nottingham, <HI>that he would try what he could do, and he did not doubt but he might ac∣complish great Services, provided he might have such a Sum of Mony; but he believes the said</HI> Fitzpatrick <HI>kept the Money himself.</HI></P>
<P>That there was a promise of a further Sum, if the intended Act of Parliament did not pass.</P>
<P>As to the 545 l. 16 s. 8 s. it was to be paid Mr. <HI>Charles Bates,</HI> when the Charter was settled, and was paid accordingly in <HI>October</HI> 1693. He himself had no acquaintance with him; but Sir <HI>Bazil Firebrace</HI> told him, <HI>He had acquaintance with several Lords, and named the Marquess of</HI> Carmarthen, <HI>now Duke of</HI> Leeds.</P>
<P>As to the first 10000 l. paid to Sir <HI>Basil Firebrace,</HI> it was paid him about <HI>Novemb.</HI> 1693. And it was always his apprehension that Sir <HI>Bazil Firebrace</HI> kept it for him∣self to recompence his Losses in the <HI>Interloping Trade.</HI></P>
<P>As to the several other sums which compleat the farther sum of 30000 l. paid to Sir <HI>Bazil,</HI> he saith, <HI>They were paid at one time, tho depending upon several Contracts.</HI></P>
<P>That it was agreed, in case the Charter passed, the Company, should take 60000 l. stock of Sir <HI>Bazil Fire∣brace,</HI> at 150 l. <HI>per Cent.</HI> When the Charter was passed, he put this stock upon the Company at 150 <HI>l. per Cent;</HI> Their Stock was then at 100 l. <HI>per Cent.</HI> by which the Company lost 30000 l. He saith, <HI>He never could tell to whom this mony was distributed; nor would Sir</HI> Bazil Firebrace <HI>give him an Account of that matter, tho often asked by him to do it; and Sir</HI> Bazil <HI>said, If he were farther pressed, he would have no m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re to do in it.</HI></P>
<P>That the Charter being passed, the <HI>Company</HI> paid the 30000 l. about <HI>January</HI> 1693. In recompence for the fall of the Stock, the Company was also to Transfer 40000 l. more Stock at 100 l. <HI>per Cent.</HI> if an Act passed in 18 Months for Confirming and inlarging their Charter; but the <HI>Act of Parliament</HI> not being passed, the Contract for that 40000 l. stock became void.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Cook</HI> produc'd a Contract dated <HI>Sept.</HI> 19. 1693. which was mentioned to be made in considera∣tion of 300 <HI>Guineas</HI> paid to him, which consideration he declared he had not Received.</P>
<P>He likewise produced another contract, dated <HI>Octob.</HI> 25. 1692.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="2"/>
<P>He saith, <HI>There were several Contracts, some to the value of</HI> 6000 l. on account of Procuring a <HI>New Charter,</HI> and others, to the value of 40000 l. on ac∣count of procuring an <HI>Act of Parliament;</HI> They were all in Sir <HI>Bazil Firebraces</HI> Name, one of each sort by him produced to shew the Nature of their Contracts.</P>
<P>He saith, <HI>The</HI> 30000 <HI>l. was paid to Sir</HI> Bazil Fire∣brace, <HI>or his Order, upon Ten several Contracts.</HI> It was paid in six several Sums, <HI>viz.</HI> 15 or 20000 l. (and he thinks 10000 l. a peice, because no more than that sum can be subscribed by one person) to <HI>Fowles</HI> and <HI>Wooton,</HI> to Mr. <HI>Edward Allen</HI> 5000 l. to Mr. <HI>Horneby</HI> 5000l. That the 30000 l. and 10000 l. were subscrib∣ed into the <HI>East-India Company;</HI> and he believes the subscribers can give better Information as to these sums.</P>
<P>He did not know but the reason why the 30000 l. was in ten several contracts might be, because Sir <HI>Ba∣zil</HI> might have occasion to distribute it to several Persons.</P>
<P>As to the 90000 l. he saith, <HI>That it was</HI> 99197 l. <HI>Stock bought for</HI> 90000 l. <HI>of several persons for the use of the Company, to make good the contracts with Sir</HI> Bazil, <HI>if he should choose to accept the Stock.</HI></P>
<P>That the Stock was transferr'd to several persons, to the Company's use; That he was accountable for it; That they had his own Obligation for the same; part of which stock was transferr'd to the Company, other part was sold to their use, and they have the money.</P>

<P><HI>At a Committe of both Houses, appointed for the Exa∣minations of several Persons touching the Receipt and Distribution of Monies mentioned in a late Act, In∣tituled,</HI> An Act to Indemnify Sir <HI>Thomas Cooke</HI> from Actions which he might be liable to, by reason of his Discovery, to whom he paid and distribut∣ed several sums of money therein mentioned to be received out of the Treasure of the <HI>East-India</HI> Company, and from any Prosecution from such Distribution.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="deposition">
<HEAD>Sir <HI>Bazil Firebrace</HI> being interrogated touching his receipt of <HI>10000</HI> l. and <HI>30000</HI> l. (charged on him by Sir <HI>Tho. Cooke</HI>) and also touching the distribution thereof.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Deposeth,</OPENER>
<P>THat rhe said sum of 10000 l. was given as a gra∣tuity to him by the said Sir <HI>Thomas Cook</HI> for his Losses, of which he had given Sir <HI>Thomas Cook</HI> a satis∣factory Account. That he received the 10000 l. some time before the Charter for the <HI>East-India</HI> Company passed.</P>
<P>That the said sum of 30000 l. was received by him by vertue of a Contract with Sir <HI>Tho. Cook,</HI> it was for <HI>Favours</HI> and <HI>Services</HI> done.</P>
<P>That the Stock at the time of the Contract valued at 150 l. <HI>per Cent.</HI> falling afterwards to 100 l. <HI>per cent.</HI> the difference was 30000 l. which they made up to him.</P>
<P>That the reason of the fall of the Stock, <HI>was the Ships not coming in,</HI> and if that had not happened, he the Deponent had gain'd as much as the 30000 l. paid him.</P>
<P>That he is positive the 10000 l. and 30000 l. were directly for himself, and the use of no other Person whatever.</P>
<P>That he paid no part of the same towards <HI>procuring a Charter,</HI> or <HI>Act of Parliament,</HI> nor made any pro∣mise so to do.</P>
<P>That he had several Discourses with Sir <HI>Tho. Cook,</HI> about using his (the Deponents) endeavours to <HI>procure a New Charter,</HI> for that it was his Interest so to do, after the Contracts were made.</P>
<P>That he did use all his Interest to prevail with the <HI>Interlopers to forhear Projecution,</HI> and that he did en∣deavour all he could to improve the Companies Stock, and made it in his bargain, <HI>That the Company should submit to Regulations in their Charter.</HI></P>
<P>He believes that Sir <HI>Tho. Cook</HI> might desire him to acquaint him how he disposed of the Mony, but that he (the Deponent) told him it was not fair, it was con∣trary to their agreement, he was not to ask him, the Deponent, what he did with his own.</P>
<P>That in some of the Contracts the <HI>consideration</HI> or <HI>praemium</HI> (mentioned therein) was paid, and refers to the contracts, <HI>that in some of them</HI> 5 <HI>l.</HI> per cent. <HI>in o∣thers</HI> 5 <HI>s. is the praemium mentioned.</HI></P>
<P>That in the contract, <HI>Sept.</HI> 15. 1693. the 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 <HI>Gui∣nea's</HI> were paid by a Note which Sir <HI>Tho. Cook</HI> kept some time, and after did deliver up to the Deponent, without having received any mony from this Depo∣nent.</P>
<P>Being asked what particular Services he did, or was to do for <HI>procuring a New Charter.</HI></P>
<P>Saith, <HI>That he wisht he might Answer to this at some other time, being not well, not having slept two or three Nights, and much indisposed, as to his Health.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That he was unwilling to take too much upon himself; he thought he did great Service to the Company in Sollici∣tation, and other Services. He knew not of any money or stock given to any Person whatever for procuring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Char∣ter.</HI></P>
<P>Being asked whether the 30000 l. or the value of 30000 l. was wholly for himself, and was not disposed to any other Person.</P>
<P>Saith, <HI>That no part of it was to any other Person, but himself, except one</HI> 500 <HI>l. paid to Mr.</HI> Powel, <HI>whose Christian Name he did not remember, but saith, that he lives at</HI> Thannet-House; <HI>That he was not sure whether he paid that out of this or his own.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It was paid to</HI> Powel, <HI>because he had good Interest a∣mong the Interlopers, and was instrumental in reconciling differences.</HI></P>

<OPENER>Deposeth,</OPENER>
<P>THat at the time when he subscribed 10000 l. into the <HI>East-India</HI> Companies Stock, he had Sir <HI>Bazil Firebrace's</HI> word for his Security (in case the Stock fell) to have 5000 l. part thereof repay'd him, if he this Deponent should desire it at the end of that year.</P>
<P>That he did call for his Money at that time, and took the <HI>East-India</HI> Companies Bonds for it, payable in <HI>March,</HI> at which time a Sale commenced; and he having his Money then paid, he Transferr'd it to the Secretary of the <HI>East-India</HI> Campany.</P>
<P>To the other 5000 l. part of his said subscription, he saith, <HI>That he had no condinions from Sir</HI> Bazil Fire∣brace; <HI>for that having subscribed before, he knew such Terms were to be had.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P>Sir <HI>Bazil Firebrace</HI> having desired leave to be called in, further Deposeth,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="deposition">
<P>That having had a Treaty with Mr. <HI>Bates,</HI> whom he thought able to do service in passing the Charter, and to have acquaintance with several Persons of Hon∣our; he this Deponent gave two Notes for 55<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 <HI>Guinea</HI>'s to Mr. <HI>Atwel,</HI> payable to Mr. <HI>Bates</HI> or Bearer.</P>

<P>That he this Deponent did put the Notes into Mr. <HI>Bates</HI>'s Hands, who told this Deponent, <HI>That he would deal with him for himself, and if the business were done, he would keep the Notes, else deliver them again.</HI></P>
<P>That the 2500 <HI>Guinea</HI>'s were paid after the Charter for restoring the <HI>East-India</HI> Company passed; the other for 3000 <HI>Guinea</HI>'s, after the Charter for Regulation passed.</P>
<P>That he had these Notes from Sir <HI>Thomas Cooke,</HI> and was accountable to him for the same, which he put into Mr. <HI>Bates</HI>'s hands.</P>
<P>That the said Sir <HI>Tho. Cooke</HI> did know, as this Depo∣dent verily believes, how these Notes were to be dis∣posed of; and further saith, <HI>He told Sir</HI> Tho. Cooke <HI>that Mr.</HI> Bates <HI>had Acquaintance with several Lords, name∣ing the Lord President, and others.</HI></P>
<P>That he this Deponent, could not tell who this money was designed for, or what <HI>Bates</HI> did with it; for that <HI>Bates</HI> would not deal on such Terms of tell∣ing Names.</P>
<P>That <HI>Bates</HI> did introduce him, this Deponent, se∣veral times to the <HI>Lord President,</HI> who made some scru∣ples in point of Law; upon which this Deponent desired his Leave that the Attorney General might wait upon him; and he accordingly brought him.</P>
<P>That he doth not remember any other Lord to whom <HI>Bates</HI> introduced him.</P>
<P>He saith, That one day last week the 5000 Gui∣nea's were offered by <HI>Bates</HI> back again to him; who said, <HI>That this might make a Noise; That if Sir</HI> Tho, Cooke <HI>thought it too much, he would give it him a∣gain;</HI> And that on <HI>Tuesday</HI> last 49<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 Guinea's, being the Value of 5500 l. brought to this Deponent.</P>
<P>That the other 500 Guinea's are still in <HI>Bates</HI>'s hands.</P>
<P>That Sir <HI>Thomas Cooke</HI> did scruple to take back this money at first, but afterwards did consent to it, the morning when he was brought up before this Com∣mittee: Whereupon this Deponent gave him <HI>Fowles</HI> his Note for the money, payable to Mr. <HI>Atwel,</HI> or the bearer: and this Deponent believes he the said Sir <HI>Thomas Cook,</HI> had a double Account, the one was made up with that Sum, the other without it.</P>
<P>He further saith, That <HI>Bates</HI> would have paid back the whole, but Sir <HI>Thomas Cook</HI> said, <HI>the Account would not be even, if the</HI> 500 <HI>Guinea's were brought into that account.</HI></P>
<P>That this was no part of the 40000 l. before menti∣oned in this Deponent's Examination, and paid to this Deponent, which 400<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 l. this Deponent saith was wholly his own; That he always took care to have it particularly understood that it was for his own use and benefit; the same was declared before Witnesses.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>
<P>That they found great stops in the business of the Charter; they apprehended it proceeded sometime from my Lord <HI>Nottingham,</HI> sometime from others.</P>
<P>That Coli. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> received 1000 Guinea's on the same Terms as was with others, if the Charter passed. He pretended great Interest with my Lord <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and that he could get information from the Lady <HI>Derby</HI> how the Queens pleasure was. Coll. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> said, he would try to prevail with the Lord <HI>Nottingham</HI> for 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>00 Guinea's upon passing the Charter, and 5000 l. on the Act of Parliament; but the Lord <HI>Nottingham</HI> refused to take it. He heard a Note (signed by Sir <HI>Josias Child,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Cook,</HI> and others) for 50000 l. was lodged in <HI>Tysons</HI> hands for about a year, to be paid in case the Act passed, and that it was refused (as he understood) by my Lord <HI>Portland;</HI> that <HI>Tyson</HI> told him <HI>he had made an Offer, and it was rejected;</HI> that <HI>Tyson</HI> told him this late∣ly.</P>
<P>That 10<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 Guinea's are entered in the <HI>East India</HI> Company's books, and were to be paid to Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> and Mr. <HI>Fakener,</HI> who are of the Interloping Inter∣est, and made great Opposition to the Charter.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Ward</HI> said, if he had a 1000 Guinea's, he would bring over others to the Company's Interest. These 10 0 Guinea's were to be paid on the arrival of the Ship <HI>Seymour.</HI></P>
<P>That Sir <HI>William Prichard</HI> and Dr. <HI>Ratcliffe</HI> did accept some <HI>East India</HI> stock, but on the same Terms as any Merchant might have done, and they paid their money for it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="deposition">
<P><HI>Richard Acton</HI> Deposeth, That he received of Sir <HI>Tho. Cook</HI> the sum of 10000 l. and 2000 l. That he, this Deponet did tell Sir <HI>Tho.

<P>That he verily believes he gave Sir <HI>Tho. Cook</HI> an ac∣count to whom he distributed it, or else he thinks the mony had not been trusted to him.</P>
<P>That he did not distribute it to Members, but to those who had Interest with Members.</P>
<P>Some of them to whom he gave mony to be distri∣buted, were Mr. <HI>Craggs</HI> (with whom this Deponent was concerned in Cloathing the Army, who had ac∣quaintance with Collonels in the House, and some <HI>Northern Members</HI>) Mr. <HI>Wallis,</HI> Mr. <HI>Ridley,</HI> Mr. <HI>Duck∣minique.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Goldwell</HI> (who is since Dead) was the only man which he himself gave mony to.</P>
<P>That if he had a little time to peruse his Papers, he could recollect further.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="deposition">
<P><HI>Nathaniel Vowel</HI> Deposeth, That he was very in∣strumental in causing a good understanding between Sir <HI>Tho. Cook</HI> and the Interlopers; and contrived how to bring <HI>Manning</HI> to move Sir <HI>Bazil Firebrace,</HI> who had been of a different Interest.</P>
<P>That Sir <HI>Bazil</HI> made some terms with Sir <HI>Tho. Cooke,</HI> upon which a Charter was to be had.</P>
<P>That he perceived by Sir <HI>Basil Firebrace,</HI> there was some difficulty in the matter. Sir <HI>Tho. Cooke</HI> insisted to know what Sir <HI>Bazil Firebrace</HI> did with the mony, which <HI>Sir Basil</HI> refused to let him know.</P>
<P>That he always withdrew at their meetings, his bu∣siness being only to go upon Errands <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o procure meet∣ings; and that one day he, this Deponent, asking Sir <HI>Bazil Firebrace, Whether he intended to make a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rter of him; Sir Bazil</HI> gave him his word, That he should have 500 <HI>Guinea</HI>'s, and that about two months since he did receive 350 l. tho the promise was to have it paid upon passing the Charter.</P>
<P>That he hath bought 10 or 15000 l. stock at one time of <HI>Sir Tho. Cooke;</HI> he never took it to be the <HI>East-India</HI> Companies, but <HI>Sir Tho.

<P>Mr. <HI>Wootton</HI> exhibited a particular Abstract relating to Sir <HI>Bazil Firebrace's</HI> Account, taken out of his <HI>Cash-book,</HI> and being subscribed by him, is hereunto an∣nexed.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="deposition">
<HEAD>Mr. <HI>Bates</HI> upon his Examination Deposeth,</HEAD>
<P>THat Sir <HI>Bazil Firebrace</HI> did apply himself to him to use his Interest for obtaining a Charter for the <HI>East India</HI> Company, the old Charter being forfeited, and told him, this Deponent, they would be very grateful for it, but cannot remember whether any particular sum was named.</P>
<P>That he, this Deponent, did use his Interest with the Lord <HI>President,</HI> who said he would do what service he could; and further saith, <HI>That the Lord President had delivered his Opinion publickly for confirming the</HI> Charter, <HI>and thought the forfeiture an hardship.</HI></P>
<P>That the Lord President had often shewed himself his Friend.</P>
<P>That he received three Notes for 5500 <HI>Guineas</HI> in the whole, that he sent a servant for the Mony, but cannot say the time: that he told the Lord President what sum he had, and would have pass'd it upon my Lord, but my Lord refused; whereupon this Depo∣nent, in regard he could not tell mony himself, did ask leave of my Lord that his servant might tell the mony, to which my Lord answered, he gave leave, and accordingly Monsieur <HI>Robart</HI> did go and receive the mony.</P>
<P>That he had not the Notes till after one Charter had pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d; but he saith that the Notes were given all together at one time, and that he, this Deponent, gave no counter Notes when he received them. But afterwards being Examined to the same matters, was not positive that counter Notes were not given. That he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hinks when he had the first treaty with Sir <HI>Bazil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 chunk" DISP="…"/></HI> that Sir <HI>Bazil</HI> did say, he, this Depo∣nent, should have a sum, and thinks he named a par∣ticular sum.</P>
<P>That 500 <HI>Guineas</HI> were received before <HI>June</HI> last, and the other 5000 <HI>Guineas</HI> afterwards.</P>
<P>That the said Notes were not out of his Possession from the time that he first had them, to the time he gave them to Monsieur <HI>Robart</HI> to receive the mony, who after he had received the mony, brought the same to him, which hath remained in his, the Deponent's, Pos∣session in his own House, till he paid 4400 <HI>Guineas</HI> thereof back again to Sir <HI>Bazil,</HI> which was upon <HI>Monday</HI> or <HI>Tuesday</HI> last, as he takes it; and being ex∣amined again to the same matter, saith, that these 4400 <HI>Guineas</HI> paid back to Sir <HI>Basil,</HI> were in four Bags, with 11 hundred <HI>Guineas</HI> in each, brought to him by <HI>Ro∣bart</HI> within a Month last past. As to the 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 <HI>Guineas</HI> remaining of the 5 00; he at first said he had spent the same; and being afterwards examined to the same matter, did say they were at home in his Study, but he may have spent some.</P>
<P>The reason why he paid back the 4400 <HI>Guinea</HI>'s was the noise that it made: and that People may think that he did not deserve them.</P>
<P>That the 5500 <HI>Guineas</HI> were for his own private use, and that he might have given them to his Foot∣man.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="deposition">
<P>Sir <HI>Bazil Firebrace</HI> Deposeth, That the <HI>East India</HI> Company's Charter being Forfeited, Sir <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke</HI> and others app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yed themselves to him, observing him active, and to have interest among Noblemen, to en∣deavour the procuring a New Charter. That Sir <HI>Thomas Cooke</HI> was apprehensive that it stuck with the Duke of <HI>Leeds,</HI> had told him, this Deponent, that some way must be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d out to the Duke. He thereupon applied himself to Mr. <HI>Bates,</HI> who would not pretend to talk with the Duke, but said he, the Deponent, must tell him what the Company would do, that he told Mr. <HI>Bates</HI> he thought a Present would be made of 2 or 3000 l. Mr. <HI>Bates</HI> told him he went to <HI>St. James</HI>'s, and said he had spoke with his Friend, and that more had been offered on the other side. At an∣other
<PB N="11" REF="6"/> time he said more was offered by our side, and at last said that 5000 l. had been offered by another hand on the same side: upon which he, this Depo∣nent, did not come up to the Market.</P>
<P>He acquainted Sir <HI>Thomas Cooke</HI> with this Proposal, who said, <HI>if it was insisted on it must be done,</HI> and so it was agreed to offer 5000 <HI>Guineas.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bates</HI> said, this was nothing to him, that he ought not to be imployed for nothing; on which this Depo∣nent was forc'd to go back to Sir <HI>Thomas Cooke</HI> for new Ordess; and so 500 Guinea's were given to him be∣sides. At first <HI>Bates</HI> said, he would undertake no fur∣ther, than that the Duke should not oppose, but be si∣lent; because he did not know but the Duke had en∣gaged himself by speaking on the other side. That he, this Deponent, did except against this, because he could not let the Company's money go for nothing: and it would reflect upon him if nothing appeared to be done for it.</P>
<P>It was agreed, that if the Duke did act in favour of the Company, he should have two or three thousand Guineas, and <HI>Bates</HI> 500 Guineas to himself. He this Deponent would have put off his 500 Guineas to the last, to engage him to take the more pains; but <HI>Bates</HI> said, his Friend would have him have the 500 Guineas to himself first.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Basil</HI> produced a Copy of Mr. <HI>Bates</HI>'s Receipt for a Note of 30<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 Guinea's, which he promised not to call for till the Charter should pass; the Original Mr. <HI>Bates</HI> had back when the money was paid, and he this Deponent had not taken a Copy of the Counter∣note for 25<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 Guineas.</P>
<P>Thot after the first Chatter was passed in <HI>October,</HI> he sent to Mr, <HI>Bates,</HI> that he might call for the money; and he did call for it in two or three days. That the other Note was paid within a week after the pas∣sing the second Charter; for the time the Notes were given we had free access to my Lord President, and found him easie and willing to give us his Assist∣ance.</P>
<P>That Mr. <HI>Bates</HI> was shy, and called it his Friend at St. <HI>James</HI>'s; that the condition of One Draught which Mr. <HI>Bates</HI> brought, was worded, <HI>In case the Lord President did not assist the Company in passing the Charter;</HI> to which this Deponent made an Alterati∣on, by putting out my Lord's Name, and making it not payable in case the Charter should not pass, or to that Effect. <HI>Bates</HI> said, it came from his Friend at St. <HI>James</HI>'s.</P>
<P>About a week before the money was brought back again, this Deponent went to <HI>Bates</HI> about it. who then told him it was all for himself.</P>
<P>That on <HI>Sunday</HI> night last, or <HI>Monday, Bates</HI> being at his own House, said, <HI>he had not the money by him, but he would fetch it; and that the money, he thought was in silver:</HI> and afterwards told this Dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nent, <HI>It was a mistake: that he had brought in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d,</HI> which accord∣ing to the computation, came to the same sum.</P>
<P>That when this Deponent told him, that Sir <HI>Tho. Cooke</HI> would not take the whole back, <HI>Bates</HI> said, he could give no answer to it till he had spoke with his Friend.</P>
<P>This Deponent saith, that on <HI>Monday</HI> last 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gui∣neas were left at his House by Mr. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> a Friend of Sir <HI>John Trevor</HI>'s, who said he brought it from Sir <HI>John Trevor,</HI> to whom Sir <HI>Thomas Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 chunk" DISP="…"/></HI> had before paid it with his own hands, under colour of an Ar∣rear for four or five years, as he had been Commis∣sioner of the Great Seal; and that he, thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Deponent, was present when Sir <HI>Tho. Cooke</HI> gave it: And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>e was at another time 200 Guineas ord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e gi∣ven to him the said Sir <HI>John Trevor</HI> as a New Years-Gift, by Sir <HI>Joseph Hern.</HI></P>
<P>That as to 20000 of the 30000 l. before menti∣oned, the sums were not actually paid till since <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y;</HI> and to the other 10000 l. he hath it now in stock in the <HI>East-India</HI> Company.</P>
<P>That as to 5000 l. part of the said 30000 l. he did design one third thereof to Sir <HI>Ed. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 chunk" DISP="…"/>,</HI> one third to Sir <HI>John Trevor,</HI> and one other third to Mr. <HI>Guy.</HI></P>
<P>That he offered the same to them by Mr. <HI>Guy:</HI> but Mr. <HI>Guy</HI> told this Deponent they did not d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 chunk" DISP="…"/> to med∣dle with the stock, but would do any service they could to promote getting the Charter.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Edward S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ymour</HI> afterwards meeting him, this Deponent, chid him for making that Proposal, and told him, <HI>If he made any more such proffers, he should never have any thing more to do with him.</HI></P>
<P>That he, this Deponent, did tell Mr. <HI>Guy,</HI> that the advantage to them in passing the Charter, an Act would be worth 10000 l. among them.</P>
<P>That he, this Deponent, did intend a distribution of all the 3000<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> l. in manner following, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>To Sir <HI>Edward Seymour,</HI> Sir <HI>John Trevor</HI> and Mr. <HI>Guy</HI> 10000 l. in case the Charter and Act of Parliament passed; to the Merchants interlopers 10000 l. and to himself 10000 l.</P>
<P>That he, this Deponent, thought himself oblig'd in honour to pay the two thirds of the 5000 l. when received, to Sir <HI>John Trevor</HI> and Mr. <HI>Guy,</HI> the other third he intended for Sir <HI>Edward Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mour,</HI> he kept for him self.</P>

<P><HI>That Order of Court is in the words following.</HI></P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng"><BODY><DIV1 TYPE="order">
<P>It is Ordered that the Cashire General do from time to time make payment of such sums of Mony for carrying on of the Companies Service, as the Gover∣nour shall direct, pursuant to the sence of the present Debate.</P>
</DIV1></BODY></TEXT></Q>
<P>But we find no Entries or mention in the Courts Books or elsewhere what that Debate was, and how far the said Order tends to the buying a Stock, we submit to the Judgment of this Court.</P>
<P>And whereas it is alledged by Sir <HI>Tho. Cock,</HI> that for the 90000 <HI>l.</HI> aforesaid there was an agreement made the several Subscribers for 99197 <HI>l.</HI> on or be∣fore the 10th day of <HI>January</HI> 189<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. yet we do not find to this hour any Warrant for the said sum, or any of that Stock transferred in the Companies Books for their Account, excepting 18300 <HI>l.</HI> stock on the 16th of <HI>January</HI> last, for which the Company have paid 10200 <HI>l.</HI> which is charged to his Account. And we
<PB N="14" REF="8"/> are further informed, that 24000 <HI>l.</HI> of the said Stock was resold at 74 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> And we do likewise find, that there is an Order of the Court of Com∣mittes dated the 9th of <HI>November</HI> last, made upon a Report from the Committees of the Treasury; so much of which Report and Order as relates to the said Stock follows in <HI>haec Verba.</HI></P>
<P>On reading a Report from the Committee of the Treasury touching the Accounts of the Deputy Go∣vernour, referred to them by Order of Court of the 26th of <HI>October</HI> last, which follows in <HI>haec Verba, viz.</HI></P>
<P>We find, that admitting the 99000 <HI>l.</HI> Stock as the Court seemed to approve to be for the Companies Account in the sum of 90000 <HI>l.</HI> there will be due from the Company to Sir <HI>Thomas Cooke</HI> about 73000 <HI>l.</HI> to compleat the monies disburst for the Investment of <HI>Cadiz;</HI> and according to the determination of the last Court, we went to Sir <HI>Josia Child,</HI> who declared that he never heard of the sale of the 24000 <HI>l.</HI> Stock until about the time it was mentioned to the Court; but as to his own Concern, he is willing to submit to the loss in that sale, considering the necessity he al∣leadged by Sir <HI>Thomas Cooke</HI> for want of Mony.</P>
<P>As to the Remainder of that Stook, being 75000 <HI>l.</HI> Stock, Sir <HI>Thomas Cooke</HI> declares it is engaged to seve∣ral Persons for Monies taken up to supply the disburse∣ments above-mentioned; which when the same is paid to him, he will be answerable for the said Stock.</P>
<P>The Court approved of the Disbursements made by the Deputy Governour, and of the 24000 <HI>l.</HI> Stock by him sold, for the reasons therein mentioned.</P>
<P>Which Appro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion being so many Months <HI>post factum,</HI> the Conside<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation thereof we likewise submit to this Court.</P>

Besides we find the Account of Charges General stands ballanced and carried to profit and loss, with this 30000 <HI>l.</HI> in∣cluded; but Mr. <HI>Thoroughgood,</HI> the Book-keeper, did declare upon Oath the 21th of <HI>February</HI> 1694. that the passing of this 30000 <HI>l.</HI> was an error of his; and coming to lay the Account of Charges General be∣fore Sir <HI>Thomas Cooke</HI> in <HI>November</HI> last, the Error was discovered by Sir <HI>Thomas Cooke,</HI> who gave him Orders to withdraw it from thence, and to place it to his own Account, which is now done; but the said proceeding between Sir <HI>Thomas Cooke</HI> and Mr. <HI>Thoroughgood</HI> was not made known to us, till we discovered the same in the Book.

In the examination of the said matter, we do find that the Contracts upon the Guinea's given out as aforesaid, were made in the Names of Private Per∣sons, and not Members of the Company; that in those Contracts no such Provision was made as might Entitle the Company to the Benefit, had any arisen by the same; but on the contrary, the said Con∣tracts were never made known to the Court of Com∣mittees, until some Months after the expiration of the time; so that if there had arisen any profit upon them, they might then have been applied to his proper Ac∣count who had the negotiating of them; in conside∣ration whereof it appeared to us, that those Contracts did no way concern or oblige the Company; and un∣derstanding
<PB N="15" REF="8"/> that the Committee of the Treasury had made a Report of the 9th of <HI>November,</HI> disallowing the same, the Clause whereof follows in <HI>haec verba, viz.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Disbursements pretended to by Sir <HI>Bazil Firebrace</HI> for Guinea's given out to have the Refusal of Stock at a certain time, and the Monies paid for Stock bought, Sir <HI>Josia Child</HI> doth declare he never was privy to any such Negotiation till very lately, nor doth he nor our selves find any ground for such an Authority given to him by the Court, whereby to lay the loss upon the Companies Stock, and therefore we can give no other Report thereupon, but refer it back to the Court.</P>
<P>And also being inform'd that the Mony was not actually paid the 19th of <HI>November,</HI> we did, as we apprehended it our Duties to do in behalf of the Ge∣neral Joint-stock, use our endeavours as much as in us lay, to prevent the payment of the said Mony, by giving the following Intimation in writing to the Companies Officers, which was produced to the Court of Committees, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>In pursuance to an Order of the General Court of Adventurers, for the General Joint-stock to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> dated the 14th of <HI>November</HI> 1694. empower∣ing us to inspect into the Affairs of the General Joint-stock, under the management of the Court of Committees, whereof several Transactions that have been had therein for the satisfaction of the Adven∣turers; and whereas upoo the consideration had of the same, Information hath been given us, that there is the sum of 16348 <HI>l.</HI> 13 <HI>s.</HI> 1 <HI>d.</HI> demanded by Sir <HI>Ba∣zil Firebrace</HI> for Guinea's given out upon Contracts for Stock, and for Stock bought, and an Order of the Court of Committees for payment of the same; which Disbursement is in our Opinion Irregu∣lar, being done without Order, and the Order for payment thereof is also irregular, being <HI>post factum:</HI> We therefore agreeing unanimously that it ought not to be allowed without the Appro∣bation first had of a General Court, have thought fitting in behalf of the said Court to signifie unto their Accountant General, that he shall not make out any Warrant for and to the Committee of the Treasury and the Cashire General, that they shall not pay the said sum of 16348 <HI>l.</HI> 13 <HI>s.</HI> 1 <HI>d.</HI> or any part thereof, or affix the Companies Seal to any Bill or Bills to that purpose, till the Pleasure of the said General Court be first known.</P>

<P>Of the disposal of which Mony we have been able to obtain no further Account, than that the same is made paid in the Companies Books in General Terms for Special Service; and that great part thereof was, as we are informed, put into the Hands of <HI>Sir Bazill Firebrace:</HI> But the most material Orders of Court that appear to us to relate to the greatest sums, are as followeth.</P>

<P>We find that the Month of <HI>September</HI> 1690. Sir <HI>Joseph Herne</HI> being Governour, and Sir <HI>Tho.

<P>We find a Contract bearing date the 28th of <HI>Fe∣bruary</HI> 1693. for 200 Tuns of <HI>Salt Peter,</HI> to be brought home in the Ship <HI>Seymour</HI> from <HI>India,</HI> to pay the sum of 12000 <HI>l.</HI> for the same, and 25 <HI>l. per</HI> Tun freight to the Owners of the Ships, besides all charges here, 2000 <HI>l.</HI> (part of the said 12 00 <HI>l.</HI>) which was the sum sent out to purchace the <HI>Salt Peter,</HI> is actually paid out of the Companies Cash, and a Bond for the remaining 110<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 <HI>l.</HI> is given under their Seal, payable the 31th of <HI>March</HI> next, whether the Ship arrive in safety or not; with this Limitation on∣ly, that if 200 Tuns of <HI>Petre</HI> be not laden upon the said Ship, then to repay in proportion to the want thereof: So that the result of this Contract is this, the Company run the Adventure of 12000 <HI>l.</HI> for that which costs only 2000 <HI>l.</HI> and must consequently lose 120<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 <HI>l.</HI> if the Ship miscarry; and on the contrary, the Seller on the other side gets 10 00 <HI>l.</HI> clear, without dis∣bursing or running the hazard of one penny: and what is yet more, as certain a loss of 9 or 10000 <HI>l.</HI> will attend it if the Ship arrive in safety.
