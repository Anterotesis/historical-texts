<HEAD>A Letter from <HI>William Penn,</HI> Proprietor and Governour of <HI>PENNSYLVANIA,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Kind Friends;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Kindness of yours by the Ship <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Anne,</HI> doth much oblige me; for by it I perceive the Interest you take in my <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Reputation,</HI> and the <HI>prosperous Begin∣nings</HI> of this <HI>Province,</HI> which you are so kind as to think may much depend upon them. In return of which, I have sent you a long Letter, and yet containing as brief an Ac∣count of <HI>My self,</HI> and the <HI>Affairs</HI> of this <HI>Province,</HI> as I have been able to make.</P>
<P>In the first place, I take notice of the <HI>News</HI> you sent me, whereby I find some Persons have had so little Wit, and so much Malice, as to report my <HI>Death,</HI> and to mend the matter, <HI>dead a Jesuit too.</HI> One might have reasonably hop'd, that this <HI>Distance,</HI> like <HI>Death,</HI> would have been a protection against <HI>Spite</HI> and <HI>Envy;</HI> and indeed, <HI>Absence</HI> being a kind of <HI>Death,</HI> ought alike to secure the <HI>Name</HI> of the <HI>Absent</HI> as the <HI>Dead;</HI> because they are equally unable as such to defend themselves: But they that intend <HI>Mischief,</HI> do not use to follow <HI>good Rules</HI> to effect it. However, to the great Sorrow and Shame of the <HI>Inventors,</HI> I am still <HI>Alive,</HI> and <HI>No Jesuit,</HI> and I thank God, <HI>very well:</HI> And without Injustice to the Authors of this, I may venture to infer, That they that wilfully and falsly <HI>Report,</HI> would have been glad it had been <HI>So.</HI> But I perceive, many <HI>Idle Stories</HI> have been <HI>Invented</HI> since my Departure from <HI>England,</HI> which perhaps at this time are no more <HI>Alive,</HI> than I am <HI>Dead.</HI></P>
<P>But if I have been <HI>Ʋnkindly</HI> used by some I left behind me, I found <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Respect</HI> enough where I came; an universal kind <HI>Welcome,</HI> every sort in their way. For here are some of se∣veral <HI>Nations,</HI> as well as divers <HI>Judgments:</HI> Nor were the <HI>Natives</HI> wanting in this, for their <HI>Kings, Queens</HI> and <HI>Great Men</HI> both visited and presented me; to whom I made suitable Returns, &amp;c.</P>
<P>For the <HI>PROVINCE,</HI> the general Condition of it take as followeth.</P>
<P N="1">I. The Country it self in its <HI>Soyl, Air, Water, Seasons</HI> and <HI>Produce</HI> both Natural and Artifi∣cial is not to be despised. The <HI>Land</HI> containeth divers sorts of <HI>Earth,</HI> as <HI>Sand</HI> Yellow and Black, Poor and Rich: also <HI>Gravel</HI> both Loomy and Dusty; and in some places a <HI>fast fat Earth,</HI> like to our best <HI>Vales</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> especially by <HI>Inland-Brooks</HI> and <HI>Rivers,</HI> God in his Wisdom having ordered it so, that the <HI>Advantages</HI> of the <HI>Country</HI> are divided, the <HI>Back-Lands</HI> being generally <HI>three</HI> to <HI>one Richer</HI> than those that lie by <HI>Navigable Waters.</HI> We have much of another <HI>Soyl,</HI> and that is a <HI>black Hasel-Mould,</HI> upon a <HI>Stony</HI> or <HI>Rocky</HI> bottom.</P>
<P N="2">II. The <HI>Air</HI> is sweet and clear, the Heavens serene, like the <HI>South-parts</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> rarely <HI>Overcast;</HI> and as the <HI>Woods</HI> come by numbers of People to be more <HI>clear'd,</HI> that it self will Refine.</P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>Waters</HI> are generally good, for the <HI>Rivers</HI> and <HI>Brooks</HI> have mostly <HI>Gravel</HI> and <HI>Stony Bottoms,</HI> and in Number hardly credible. We have also <HI>Mineral Waters,</HI> that operate in the same manner with <HI>Barnet</HI> and <HI>North-hall,</HI> not two Miles from <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. For the <HI>Seasons</HI> of the Year, having by God's goodness now lived over the <HI>Coldest</HI> and <HI>Hottest,</HI> that the <HI>Oldest Liver</HI> in the <HI>Province</HI> can remember, I can say something to an <HI>English</HI> Understanding.</P>
<P N="1">1st, Of the <HI>Fall,</HI> for then I came in: I found it from the 24th of <HI>October,</HI> to the beginning of <HI>December,</HI> as we have it usually in <HI>England</HI> in <HI>September,</HI> or rather like an <HI>English mild Spring.</HI> From <HI>December</HI> to the beginning of the Moneth called <HI>March,</HI> we had <HI>sharp Frosty Weather,</HI> not foul, thick, black Weather, as our <HI>North-East Winds</HI> bring with them in <HI>England;</HI> but a Skie as clear as in <HI>Summer,</HI> and the Air dry, cold, piercing and hungry; yet I remember not, that I wore more <HI>Clothes</HI> than in <HI>England.</HI> The reason of this <HI>Cold</HI> is given from the great <HI>Lakes</HI> that are fed by the <HI>Fountains</HI> of <HI>Canada.</HI> The <HI>Winter</HI> before was as <HI>mild,</HI> scarce any <HI>Ice</HI> at all; while this for a <HI>few dayes Froze</HI> up our great River <HI>Delaware.</HI> From that Moneth to the Moneth called <HI>June,</HI> we enjoy'd a <HI>sweet Spring,</HI> no <HI>Gusts,</HI> but <HI>gentle Showers,</HI> and a fine Skie. Yet this I observe, that the <HI>Winds</HI> here as there, are more Inconstant <HI>Spring</HI> and <HI>Fall,</HI> upon that turn of Nature, than in <HI>Summer</HI> or <HI>Winter.</HI> From thence to this present, Moneth, which endeth the <HI>Summer</HI> (commonly speaking) we have had <HI>extraordinary Heats</HI> yet mitigated sometimes by <HI>Cool Br<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ezese.</HI> The <HI>Wind</HI> that ruleth the <HI>Summer-season,</HI> is the
<PB N="4" REF="3"/><HI>South-West;</HI> but <HI>Spring, Fall</HI> and <HI>Winter,</HI> 'tis rare to want the <HI>wholesome North Wester</HI> seven dayes together: And what-ever <HI>Mists, Fogs</HI> or <HI>Vapours</HI> foul the Heavens by <HI>Easterly</HI> or <HI>Southerly Winds,</HI> in two Hours time are blown away; the <HI>one</HI> is alwayes followed by the <HI>other:</HI> A Re∣medy that seems to have a peculiar Providence in it to the Inhabitants; the multitude of <HI>Trees,</HI> yet standing, being liable to retain <HI>Mists</HI> and <HI>Vapours,</HI> and yet not one quarter so <HI>thick</HI> as I expected.</P>
<P N="5">V. The <HI>Natural Produce</HI> of the Country, of <HI>Vegetables,</HI> is <HI>Trees, Fruits, Plants, Flowers.</HI> The <HI>Trees</HI> of most note are, the <HI>black Walnut, Cedar, Cyprus, Chestnut, Poplar, Gumwood, Hic∣kery, Sassafrax, Ash, Beech</HI> and <HI>Oak</HI> of divers sorts, as <HI>Red, White</HI> and <HI>Black; Spanish Chestnut</HI> and <HI>Swamp,</HI> the most durable of all: of <HI>All</HI> which there is plenty for the use of man.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fruits</HI> that I find in the <HI>Woods,</HI> are the <HI>White</HI> and <HI>Black Mulbery, Chestnut, Wallnut, Plumbs, Strawberries, Cranberries, Hurtleberries</HI> and <HI>Grapes</HI> of divers sorts. The great <HI>Red Grape</HI> (now ripe) called by Ignorance, the <HI>Fox-Grape</HI> (because of the Relish it hath with unskilful Palates) is in it self an extraordinary <HI>Grape,</HI> and by Art doubtless may be Cultivated to an excellent <HI>Wine,</HI> if not so sweet, yet little inferior to the <HI>Frontiniack,</HI> as it is not much unlike in taste, Ruddiness set aside, which in such things, as well as Mankind, differs the case much. There is a <HI>white</HI> kind of <HI>Muskedel,</HI> and a little <HI>black Grape,</HI> like the Cluster-Grape of <HI>England,</HI> not yet so ripe as the other; but they tell me, when Ripe, sweeter, and that they only want skilful <HI>Vinerons</HI> to make good use of them: I intend to venture on it with my <HI>French-man</HI> this season, who shews some knowledge in those things. Here are also <HI>Peaches,</HI> and very good, and in great quantities, not an <HI>Indian Plantation</HI> without them; but whether naturally here at first, I know not, however one may have them by <HI>Bushels</HI> for little; they make a pleasant <HI>Drink</HI> and I think not inferior to any <HI>Peach</HI> you have in <HI>England,</HI> except the true <HI>Newington.</HI> 'Tis dispu∣table with me, whether it be best to fall to <HI>Fining</HI> the Fruits of the Country, especially the <HI>Grape,</HI> by the care and skill of Art, or send for <HI>forreign Stems</HI> and <HI>Sets,</HI> already good and approved: It seems most reasonable to believe, that not only a thing groweth best, where it naturally grows; but will hardly be equalled by another <HI>Species</HI> of the same kind, that doth not naturally grow there. But to <HI>solve</HI> the doubt, I intend, if God give me Life, to try <HI>both,</HI> and hope the consequence will be as <HI>good Wine</HI> as any <HI>European</HI> Countries of the same Latitude do yield.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The <HI>Artificial Produce</HI> of the Country, is <HI>Wheat, Barley, Oats, Rye, Pease, Beans, Squashes, Pumkins,</HI>
<NOTE>Note, that <HI>Edward Jones,</HI> Son∣in-Law to <HI>Thomas Wynn,</HI> living on the <HI>Schulkil,</HI> had with ordinary Cul∣tivation, for one <HI>one Grain</HI> of <HI>English Barley, seventy Stalks</HI> and <HI>Ears</HI> of <HI>Barley;</HI> And 'tis common in this Country from <HI>one Bushel</HI> sown, to reap <HI>forty,</HI> often <HI>fifty,</HI> and sometimes <HI>sixty.</HI> And three <HI>Pecks</HI> of <HI>Wheat</HI> sows an <HI>Acre</HI> here.</NOTE> <HI>Water-Melons, Mus-Melons,</HI> and all Herbs and Roots that our Gardens in <HI>England</HI> usually bring forth.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Of living Creatures; <HI>Fish, Fowl,</HI> and the Beasts of the Woods, here are divers sorts, some for Food and Profit, and some for Profit only: For Food as well as Profit, the <HI>Elk,</HI> as big as a small <HI>Ox, Deer</HI> bigger than ours, <HI>Beaver, Racoon, Rab∣bits, Squirrels,</HI> and some eat young <HI>Bear,</HI> and commend it. Of <HI>Fowl</HI> of the Land, there is the <HI>Turkey</HI> (Forty and Fifty Pound weight) which is very great; <HI>Phesants, Heath-Birds, Pidgeons</HI> and <HI>Partridges</HI> in abundance. Of the Water, the <HI>Swan, Goose,</HI> white and gray, <HI>Brands, Ducks, Teal,</HI> also the <HI>Snipe</HI> and <HI>Curloe,</HI> and that in great Numbers; but the <HI>Duck</HI> and <HI>Teal</HI> excel, nor so good have I ever eat in other Countries. Of <HI>Fish,</HI> there is the <HI>Sturgeon, Herring, Rock, Shad, Catshead, Sheepshead, Ele, Smelt, Pearch, Roach;</HI> and in Inland Rivers, <HI>Trout,</HI> some say <HI>Salmon,</HI> above the Falls. Of <HI>Shel∣fish,</HI> we have <HI>Oysters, Crabbs, Cockles, Concks</HI> and <HI>Mushels;</HI> some <HI>Oysters six Inches</HI> long, and one sort of <HI>Cockles</HI> as big as the Stewing <HI>Oysters,</HI> they make a rich Broth. The Creatures for Profit only by <HI>Skin</HI> or <HI>Fur,</HI> and that are natural to these parts, are the <HI>Wild Cat, Panther, Otter, Wolf, Fox, Fisher, Minx, Musk-Rat;</HI> and of the Water, the <HI>Whale</HI> for <HI>Oyl,</HI> of which we have good store, and two Companies of <HI>Whalers,</HI> whose Boats are built, will soon begin their Work, which hath the appearance of a considerable Improvement. To say nothing of our rea∣sonable Hopes of good <HI>Cod</HI> in the <HI>Bay.</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. We have no want of <HI>Horses,</HI> and some are very good and shapely enough; two Ships have been freighted to <HI>Barbadoes</HI> with <HI>Horses</HI> and <HI>Pipe-Staves,</HI> since my coming in. Here is also Plenty of <HI>Cow-Cattle,</HI> and some <HI>Sheep;</HI> the People <HI>Plow</HI> mostly with <HI>Oxen.</HI></P>
<P N="9">IX. There are divers <HI>Plants</HI> that not only the <HI>Indians</HI> tell us, but we have had occasion to prove by <HI>Swellings, Burnings, Cuts,</HI> &amp;c. that they are of great Virtue, suddenly curing the Pa∣tient: and for <HI>smell,</HI> I have observed several, especially one, the <HI>wild Mirtle;</HI> the other I know not what to call, but are most <HI>fragrant.</HI></P>
<P N="10">X. The <HI>Woods</HI> are adorned with lovely <HI>Flowers,</HI> for <HI>colour, greatness, figure</HI> and <HI>variety:</HI> I have seen the <HI>Gardens</HI> of <HI>London</HI> best stored with that sort of Beauty, but think they may be im∣proved by our <HI>Woods:</HI> I have sent a few to a Person of Quality this Year for a tryal.</P>
<P>Thus much of the <HI>Country,</HI> next of the <HI>Natives</HI> or <HI>Aborigines.</HI></P>
<P N="11"><PB N="5" REF="3"/> XI. The <HI>NATIVES</HI> I shall consider in their <HI>Persons, Language, Manners, Religion</HI> and <HI>Government,</HI> with my sence of their <HI>Original.</HI> For their <HI>Persons,</HI> they are generally tall, streight, well-built, and of singular Proportion; they tread strong and clever, and mostly walk with a lofty Chin: Of Complexion, <HI>Black,</HI> but by design, as the <HI>Gypsies</HI> in <HI>England:</HI> They grease themselves with Bears-sat clarified, and using no defence against <HI>Sun</HI> or <HI>Weather,</HI> their skins must needs be swarthy: Their <HI>Eye</HI> is little and black, not unlike a straight-look't <HI>Jew:</HI> The <HI>thick Lip</HI> and <HI>flat Nose,</HI> so frequent with the <HI>East-Indians</HI> and <HI>Blacks,</HI> are not common to them; for I have seen as comely <HI>European-like faces</HI> among them of both, as on your side the Sea; and truly an <HI>Italian Complexion</HI> hath not much more of the <HI>White,</HI> and the <HI>Noses</HI> of several of them have as much of the <HI>Roman.</HI></P>
<P N="12">XII. Their <HI>Language</HI> is lofty, yet narrow, but like the <HI>Hebrew;</HI> in Signification full, like <HI>Short-hand</HI> in writing; <HI>one</HI> word serveth in the place of <HI>three,</HI> and the rest are supplied by the Understanding of the Hearer: Imperfect in their <HI>Tenses,</HI> wanting in their <HI>Moods, Participles, Adverbs, Conjunctions, Interjections:</HI> I have made it my business to understand it, that I might not want an Interpreter on any occasion: And I must say, that I know not a Language spoken in <HI>Europe,</HI> that hath words of more sweetness or greatness, in <HI>Accent</HI> and <HI>Emphasis,</HI> than theirs; for Instance, <HI>Octorockon, Rancocas, Oricton, Shakamaron, Poquessin,</HI> all which are names of Places, and have Grandeur in them: Of words of Sweetness, <HI>Anna,</HI> is <HI>Mother, <HI>Is∣simus,</HI> a Brother, <HI>Qetap,</HI> Friend, <HI>usque oret,</HI> very good; <HI>pone,</HI> Bread, <HI>metse,</HI> eat, <HI>matta,</HI> no, <HI>hatta,</HI> to have, <HI>payo,</HI> to come; <HI>Sepassen, Passion,</HI></HI> the Names of Places; <HI>Tamane, Secane, Menanse, Secatereus,</HI> are the Names of Persons. If one ask them for any thing they have not, they will answer, <HI>mattá ne hattá,</HI> which to translate is, <HI>not I have,</HI> instead of <HI>I have not.</HI></P>
<P N="13">XIII. Of their <HI>Customs</HI> and <HI>Manners</HI> there is much to be said; I will begin with <HI>Children.</HI> So soon as they are born, they wash them in <HI>Water,</HI> and while very young, and in cold Weather to chuse, they <HI>Plunge</HI> them in the Rivers to harden and embolden them. Having wrapt them in a Clout, they lay them on a straight thin Board, a little more than the length and breadth of the Child, and swadle it fast upon the Board to make it straight; wherefore all <HI>Indians</HI> have flat Heads; and thus they carry them at their Backs. The Children will go very <HI>young,</HI> at <HI>nine Moneths</HI> commonly; they wear only a small Clout round their Waste, till they are big; if <HI>Boys,</HI> they go a Fishing till ripe for the Woods, which is about <HI>Fifteen;</HI> then they Hunt, and after having given some Proofs of their Manhood, by a good return of <HI>Skins,</HI> they may <HI>Marry,</HI> else it is a shame to think of a <HI>Wife.</HI> The <HI>Girls</HI> stay with their Mothers, and help to hoe the Ground, plant Corn and carry Burthens; and they do well to use them to that <HI>Young,</HI> they must do when they are <HI>Old;</HI> for the <HI>Wives</HI> are the true <HI>Servants</HI> of their <HI>Husbands:</HI> otherwise the Men are very affectionate to them.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. When the <HI>Young Women</HI> are fit for <HI>Marriage,</HI> they wear something upon their Heads for an Advertisement, but so as their Faces are hardly to be seen, but when they please: The <HI>Age</HI> they <HI>Marry</HI> at, if <HI>Women,</HI> is about <HI>thirteen</HI> and <HI>fourteen;</HI> if <HI>Men, seventeen</HI> and <HI>eighteen;</HI> they are rarely elder.</P>
<P N="15">XV. Their <HI>Houses</HI> are <HI>Mats,</HI> or <HI>Barks of Trees</HI> set on Poles, in the fashion of an <HI>English Barn,</HI> but out of the power of the Winds, for they are hardly higher than a Man; they lie on <HI>Reeds</HI> or <HI>Grass.</HI> In <HI>Travel</HI> they lodge in the <HI>Woods</HI> about a great Fire, with the Mantle of <HI>Duffills</HI> they wear by day, wrapt about them, and a few Boughs stuck round them.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. Their <HI>Diet</HI> is <HI>Maze,</HI> or <HI>Indian Corn,</HI> divers ways prepared; sometimes <HI>Roasted</HI> in the Ashes, sometimes beaten and <HI>Boyled</HI> with Water, which they call <HI>Homine;</HI> they also make <HI>Cakes,</HI> not unpleasant to eat: They have likewise several sorts of <HI>Beans</HI> and <HI>Pease</HI> that are good Nourishment; and the <HI>Woods</HI> and <HI>Rivers</HI> are their <HI>Larder.</HI></P>
<P N="17">XVII. If an <HI>European</HI> comes to see them, or calls for Lodging at their House or <HI>Wigwam,</HI> they give him the best place and first cut. If they come to visit us, they salute us with an <HI>Itah,</HI> which is as much as to say, <HI>Good be to you,</HI> and set them down, which is mostly on the Ground, close to their Heels, their Legs upright; may be they speak not a word more, but observe all Passages: If you give them any thing to eat or drink, well, for they will not ask; and be it little or much, if it be with Kindness, they are well pleased, else they go away sullen, but say nothing.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. They are great <HI>Concealers</HI> of their own <HI>Resentments,</HI> brought to it, I believe, by the <HI>Revenge</HI> that hath been practised among them; in either of these, they are not exceeded by the <HI>Italians.</HI> A <HI>Tragical</HI> Instance fell out since I came into the Country; A <HI>King's Daughter</HI> think∣ing her self slighted by her Husband, in suffering another <HI>Woman</HI> to lie down between them, rose up, went out, pluck't a Root out of the Ground, and ate it, upon which she immediately dyed; and for which, last Week he made an <HI>Offering</HI> to her Kindred for <HI>Attonement</HI> and liberty of Marriage; as two others did to the Kindred of their Wives, that dyed a natural Death: For
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>till <HI>Widdowers</HI> have done so, they must not <HI>marry</HI> again. Some of the <HI>young Women</HI> are said to take undue liberty before <HI>Marriage</HI> for a Portion; but when <HI>marryed,</HI> chaste; when with Child, they know their Husbands no more, till delivered; and during their Moneth, they touch no <HI>Meat;</HI> they eat, but with a <HI>Stick,</HI> least they should defile it; nor do their Husbands frequent them, till that time be expired.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. But in <HI>Liberality</HI> they excell, nothing is too good for their friend; give them a <HI>fine Gun, Coat,</HI> or other thing, it may pass <HI>twenty hands,</HI> before it sticks; <HI>light</HI> of Heart, <HI>strong</HI> Af∣fections, but soon spent; the most <HI>merry</HI> Creatures that live, <HI>Feast</HI> and <HI>Dance</HI> perpetually; they never have much, nor want much: <HI>Wealth</HI> circulateth like the <HI>Blood,</HI> all parts partake; and though none shall want what another hath, yet exact Observers of <HI>Property.</HI> Some <HI>Kings</HI> have sold, others presented me with several <HI>parcels</HI> of <HI>Land;</HI> the Pay or Presents I made them, were <HI>not hoarded</HI> by the particular Owners, but the <HI>neighbouring Kings</HI> and their <HI>Clans</HI> being present when the Goods were brought out, the Parties chiefly concerned consulted, what and to whom they should give them? To every <HI>King</HI> then, by the hands of a Person for that work appointed, is a proportion sent, so sorted and folded, and with that <HI>Gravity,</HI> that is admirable. Then that <HI>King</HI> sub-divideth it in like manner among his Dependents, they hardly leaving themselves an <HI>Equal share</HI> with one of their <HI>Subjects:</HI> and be it on such occasions, at <HI>Festivals,</HI> or at their <HI>common Meals,</HI> the <HI>Kings</HI> distribute, and to themselves <HI>last.</HI> They care for <HI>little,</HI> because they want but <HI>little;</HI> and the Reason is, a <HI>little</HI> contents them: In this they are sufficiently revenged on us; if they are ignorant of our <HI>Pleasures,</HI> they are also free from our <HI>Pains.</HI> They are not disquiet∣ed with <HI>Bills of Lading</HI> and <HI>Exchange,</HI> nor perplexed with <HI>Chancery-Suits</HI> and <HI>Exchequer-Reckon∣ings.</HI> We <HI>sweat</HI> and <HI>toil</HI> to live; their <HI>pleasure</HI> feeds them, I mean, their <HI>Hunting, Fishing</HI> and <HI>Fowling,</HI> and this Table is spread every where; they <HI>eat twice a day,</HI> Morning and Evening; their <HI>Seats</HI> and <HI>Table</HI> are the <HI>Ground.</HI> Since the <HI>Europeans</HI> came into these parts, they are grown great lovers of <HI>strong Liquors, Rum</HI> especially, and for it exchange the richest of their <HI>Skins</HI> and <HI>Furs:</HI> If they are heated with <HI>Liquors,</HI> they are restless till they have enough to <HI>sleep;</HI> that is their cry, <HI>Some more, and I will go to sleep;</HI> but when <HI>Drunk,</HI> one of the <HI>most wretchedst Spectacles in the World.</HI></P>
<P N="20">XX. In <HI>Sickness</HI> impatient to be cured, and for it give any thing, especially for their <HI>Children,</HI> to whom they are extreamly natural; they drink at those times a <HI>Teran</HI> or Decoction of some Roots in spring Water; and if they eat any <HI>flesh,</HI> it must be of the <HI>Female</HI> of any Creature: If they dye, they bury them with their <HI>Apparel,</HI> be they <HI>Men</HI> or <HI>Women,</HI> and the nearest of <HI>Kin</HI> fling in something precious with them, as a token of their Love: Their <HI>Mourning</HI> is <HI>blacking</HI> of their <HI>faces,</HI> which they continue for a <HI>year:</HI> They are choice of the <HI>Graves</HI> of their <HI>Dead;</HI> for least they should be lost by time, and fall to common use, they <HI>pick off the Grass</HI> that grows upon them, and heap up the fallen Earth with great care and exactness.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. These poor People are under a dark Night in things relating to <HI>Religion,</HI> to be sure, the <HI>Tradition</HI> of it; yet they believe a <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Immortality,</HI> without the help of <HI>Metaphysicks;</HI> for they say, <HI>There is a great King that made them, who dwells in a glorious Country to the Southward of them,</HI> and <HI>that the Souls of the good shall go thither, where they shall live again.</HI> Their <HI>Worship</HI> consists of two parts, <HI>Sacrifice</HI> and <HI>Cantico.</HI> Their <HI>Sacrifice</HI> is their <HI>first Fruits;</HI> the first and fattest <HI>Buck</HI> they kill, goeth to the <HI>fire,</HI> where he is all burnt with a <HI>Mournful Ditty</HI> of him that perform∣eth the <HI>Ceremony,</HI> but with such <HI>marvellous Fervency</HI> and <HI>Labour of Body,</HI> that he will even <HI>sweat</HI> to a <HI>foam.</HI> The other part is their <HI>Cantico,</HI> performed by round-<HI>Dances,</HI> sometimes <HI>Words,</HI> sometimes <HI>Songs,</HI> then <HI>Shouts,</HI> two being in the middle that begin, and by <HI>Singing</HI> and <HI>Drum∣ming</HI> on a <HI>Board</HI> direct the <HI>Chorus:</HI> Their Postures in the <HI>Dance</HI> are very <HI>Antick</HI> and differing, but all <HI>keep measure.</HI> This is done with equal Earnestness and Labour, but great appearance of <HI>Joy.</HI> In the <HI>Fall,</HI> when the <HI>Corn</HI> cometh in, they begin to <HI>feast</HI> one another; there have been two great <HI>Festivals</HI> already, to which all come that will: I was at one my self; their Entertain∣ment was a <HI>green Seat</HI> by a <HI>Spring,</HI> under some <HI>shady Trees,</HI> and <HI>twenty Bucks,</HI> with <HI>hot Cakes</HI> of <HI>new Corn,</HI> both <HI>Wheat</HI> and <HI>Reans,</HI> which they make up in a square form, in the leaves of the Stem, and bake them in the Ashes: And after that they fell to <HI>Dance.</HI> But they that go, must carry a small <HI>Present</HI> in <HI>their Money,</HI> it may be <HI>six Pence,</HI> which is made of the <HI>Bone</HI> of a <HI>Fish;</HI> the <HI>black</HI> is with them as <HI>Gold,</HI> the <HI>white, Silver;</HI> they call it all <HI>Wampum.</HI></P>
<P N="22">XXII. Their <HI>Government</HI> is by <HI>Kings,</HI> which they call <HI>Sachema,</HI> and those by <HI>Succession,</HI> but always of the <HI>Mothers side;</HI> for Instance, the <HI>Children</HI> of him that is now <HI>King,</HI> will not succeed, but his <HI>Brother</HI> by the <HI>Mother,</HI> or the <HI>Children</HI> of his <HI>Sister,</HI> whose <HI>Sons</HI> (and after them the <HI>Children</HI> of her <HI>Daughters</HI>) will reign; for no <HI>Woman</HI> inherits; the Reason they render for this way of <HI>Descent,</HI> is, that their Issue may not be <HI>spurious.</HI></P>
<P N="23">XXIII. Every <HI>King</HI> hath his <HI>Council,</HI> and that consists of all the <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>Wise men</HI> of his <HI>Nation,</HI> which perhaps is <HI>two hundred People:</HI> nothing of Moment is undertaken, be it <HI>War, Peace, Sel∣ling</HI> of <HI>Land</HI> or <HI>Traffick,</HI> without advising with them; and which is more, with the <HI>Young Men</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>too. 'Tis admirable to consider, how <HI>Powerful</HI> the <HI>Kings</HI> are, and yet how they move by the <HI>Breath</HI> of their <HI>People.</HI> I have had occasion to be in <HI>Council</HI> with them upon <HI>Treaties</HI> for <HI>Land,</HI> and to adjust the terms of <HI>Trade;</HI> their Order is thus: The <HI>King</HI> sits in the middle of an half Moon, and hath his <HI>Council,</HI> the <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>Wise</HI> on each hand; behind them, or at a little distance, sit the younger <HI>Fry,</HI> in the same figure. Having consulted and resolved their business, the <HI>King</HI> ordered one of them to speak to me; he stood up, came to me, and in the Name of his <HI>King</HI> saluted me, then took me by the hand, and told me, <HI>That he was ordered by his</HI> King <HI>to speak to me, and that now it was not he, but the</HI> King <HI>that spoke, because what he should say, was the</HI> King's <HI>mind.</HI> He first pray'd me, <HI>To excuse them that they had not complyed with me the last time; he feared, there might be some fault in the Interpreter, being neither</HI> Indian <HI>nor</HI> English; <HI>besides, it was the</HI> Indian <HI>Custom to deliberate, and take up much time in Council, before they resolve; and that if the Young People and Owners of the Land had been as ready as he, I had not met with so much delay.</HI> Having thus introduced his matter, he fell to the Bounds of the Land they had agreed to dispose of, and the Price, (which now is little and dear, that which would have bought <HI>twenty Miles,</HI> not buying now <HI>two.</HI>) During the time that this Person spoke, not a man of them was observed to <HI>whisper</HI> or <HI>smile;</HI> the <HI>Old Grave,</HI> the <HI>Young Reverend</HI> in their <HI>Deportment;</HI> they do speak <HI>little,</HI> but <HI>fervently,</HI> and with <HI>Elegancy:</HI> I have never seen more <HI>natural Sagacity,</HI> considering them without the help, (I was a going to say, the <HI>spoil</HI>) of <HI>Tradition;</HI> and he will deserve the Name of <HI>Wise,</HI> that <HI>Out-wits</HI> them in any <HI>Treaty</HI> about a thing they understand. When the Purchase was agreed, great Promises past between us <HI>of Kindness and good Neighbourhood, and that the</HI> Indians <HI>and</HI> English <HI>must live in Love, as long as the Sun gave light.</HI> Which done, another made a Speech to the <HI>Indians,</HI> in the Name of all the <HI>Sachamakers</HI> or <HI>Kings,</HI> first to tell them what was done; next, to charge and command them, <HI>To Love the</HI> Christians, <HI>and particularly live in Peace with</HI> me, <HI>and the People under my Government: That many Governours had been in the River, but that no Governour had come himself to live and stay here before; and having now such a one that had treated them well, they should never do him or his any wrong.</HI> At every sentence of which they shouted, and said, <HI>Amen,</HI> in their way.</P>
<P N="24">XXIV. The <HI>Justice</HI> they have is <HI>Pecuniary:</HI> In case of any <HI>Wrong</HI> or <HI>evil Fact,</HI> be it <HI>Murther</HI> it self, they Attone by <HI>Feasts</HI> and <HI>Presents</HI> of their <HI>Wampon,</HI> which is proportioned to the quality of the <HI>Offence</HI> or <HI>Person injured,</HI> or of the <HI>Sex</HI> they are of: for in case they <HI>kill</HI> a <HI>Woman,</HI> they pay <HI>double,</HI> and the Reason they render, is, <HI>That she breedeth Children, which Men cannot do.</HI> 'Tis rare that they fall out, if <HI>Sober;</HI> and if <HI>Drunk,</HI> they forgive it, saying, <HI>It was the Drink, and not the Man, that abused them.</HI></P>
<P N="25">XXV. We have agreed, that in all <HI>Differences</HI> between us, <HI>Six</HI> of each side shall end the matter: Don't <HI>abuse</HI> them, but let them have <HI>Justice,</HI> and you win them: The worst is, that they are the <HI>worse</HI> for the <HI>Christians,</HI> who have propagated their <HI>Vices,</HI> and yielded them <HI>Tradition</HI> for <HI>ill,</HI> and not for <HI>good things.</HI> But as <HI>low</HI> an <HI>Ebb</HI> as they are at, and as <HI>glorious</HI> as their Condition looks, the <HI>Christians</HI> have not <HI>out-liv'd</HI> their <HI>sight</HI> with all their <HI>Pretensions</HI> to an <HI>higher Manifestation:</HI> What <HI>good</HI> then might not a <HI>good People</HI> graft, where there is so <HI>distinct a Knowledge</HI> left between <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Evil?</HI> I beseech God to incline the <HI>Hearts</HI> of all that come into these parts, to <HI>out-live</HI> the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of the <HI>Natives,</HI> by a <HI>fixt Obedience</HI> to their <HI>greater Knowledge</HI> of the <HI>Will of God;</HI> for it were <HI>miserable</HI> indeed for us to fall under the just <HI>censure</HI> of the poor <HI>Indian Conscience,</HI> while we make profession of things so far <HI>transcending.</HI></P>
<P N="26">XXVI. For their <HI>Original,</HI> I am ready to believe them of the <HI>Jewish Race,</HI> I mean, of the stock of the <HI>Ten Tribes,</HI> and that for the following Reasons; <HI>first,</HI> They were to go to a <HI>Land not planted or known,</HI> which to be sure <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> were, if not <HI>Europe;</HI> and he that intended that extra∣ordinary Judgment upon them, might make the Passage not uneasie to them, as it is not impos∣sible in it self, from the <HI>Easter-most</HI> parts of <HI>Asia,</HI> to the <HI>Wester-most</HI> of <HI>America.</HI> In the <HI>next</HI> place, I find them of like <HI>Countenance,</HI> and their Children of so <HI>lively Resemblance,</HI> that a man would think himself in <HI>Dukes-place</HI> or <HI>Berry-street</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> when he seeth them. But this is not all, they agree in <HI>Rites,</HI> they reckon by <HI>Moons;</HI> they <HI>offer</HI> their <HI>first Fruits,</HI> they have a kind of <HI>Feast</HI> of <HI>Tabernacles;</HI> they are said to lay their <HI>Altar</HI> upon <HI>twelve Stones;</HI> their <HI>Mourning a year, Customs of Women,</HI> with many things that do not now occur.</P>
<P>So much for the <HI>Natives,</HI> next the <HI>Old Planters</HI> will be considered in this Relation, before I come to our <HI>Colony,</HI> and the Concerns of it.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. The <HI>first Planters</HI> in these parts were the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and soon after them the <HI>Sweeds</HI> and <HI>Finns.</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> applied themselves to <HI>Traffick,</HI> the <HI>Sweeds</HI> and <HI>Finns</HI> to <HI>Husbandry.</HI> There were some Disputes between them some years, the <HI>Dutch</HI> looking upon them as <HI>Intruders</HI> upon their Purchase and Possession, which was finally ended in the <HI>Surrender</HI> made by <HI>John Rizeing,</HI> the <HI>Sweeds</HI> Governour, to <HI>Peter Styresant,</HI> Governour for the <HI>States</HI> of <HI>Holland, Anno</HI> 1655.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. The <HI>Dutch</HI> inhabit mostly those parts of the <HI>Province,</HI> that lie upon or near to the <HI>Bay,</HI> and the <HI>Sweeds</HI> the <HI>Freshes</HI> of the River <HI>Delaware.</HI> There is no need of giving any De∣scription
<PB N="8" REF="5"/>of them, who are better known there than here; but they are a <HI>plain, strong, industrious People,</HI> yet have made no great progress in <HI>Culture</HI> or <HI>propagation</HI> of <HI>fruit-Trees,</HI> as if they desired rather to have enough, than <HI>Plenty</HI> or <HI>Traffick.</HI> But I presume, the <HI>Indians</HI> made them the more careless, by furnishing them with the means of <HI>Profit,</HI> to wit, <HI>Skins</HI> and <HI>Furs,</HI> for <HI>Rum,</HI> and such <HI>strong Liquors.</HI> They kindly received me, as well as the <HI>English,</HI> who were few, before the People concerned with me came among them: I must needs commend their <HI>Respect</HI> to <HI>Au∣thority,</HI> and <HI>kind Behaviour</HI> to the <HI>English;</HI> they do not degenerate from the <HI>Old friendship</HI> between <HI>both Kingdoms.</HI> As they are People <HI>proper</HI> and <HI>strong</HI> of <HI>Body,</HI> so they have <HI>fine Children,</HI> and al∣most every house full; rare to find one of them without <HI>three</HI> or <HI>four Boys,</HI> and as many <HI>Girls;</HI> some <HI>six, seven</HI> and <HI>eight Sons:</HI> And I must do them that right, I see few <HI>Young men</HI> more <HI>sober</HI> and <HI>laborious.</HI></P>
<P N="29">XXIX. The <HI>Dutch</HI> have a <HI>Meeting-place</HI> for Religious Worship at <HI>New-Castle,</HI> and the <HI>Sweedes, three,</HI> one at <HI>Christina,</HI> one at <HI>Tenecum,</HI> and one at <HI>Wicoco,</HI> within half a Mile of this Town.</P>
<P N="30">XXX. There rests, that I speak of the <HI>Condition</HI> we are in, and what <HI>Settlement</HI> we have made, in which I will be as short as I can; for I fear, and not without reason, that I have tryed your Patience with this long Story. The <HI>Country</HI> lieth bounded on the <HI>East,</HI> by the River and Bay of <HI>Delaware,</HI> and <HI>Eastern Sea;</HI> it hath the Advantage of many <HI>Creeks</HI> or <HI>Rivers</HI> rather, that run into the main River or Bay; some Navigable for great Ships, some for small Craft: Those of most Eminency are <HI>Christina, Brandywine, Skilpot</HI> and <HI>Skulkill;</HI> any one of which have room to lay up the <HI>Royal Navy</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> there being from <HI>four</HI> to <HI>eight Fathom</HI> Water.</P>
<P N="31">XXXI. The <HI>lesser Creeks</HI> or <HI>Rivers,</HI> yet convenient for Sloops and Ketches of good Burthen, are <HI>Lewis, Mespilion, Cedar, Dover, Cranbrook, Fevershan,</HI> and <HI>Georges</HI> below, and <HI>Chichester, Chester, Toacawny. Pemmapecka, Portquessin, Neshimenck</HI> and <HI>Pennberry</HI> in the Freshes; many lesser that admit Boats and Shallops. Our People are mostly settled upon the upper Rivers, which are pleasant and sweet, and generally bounded with good Land. The Planted part of the Province and Territories is cast into six Counties, <HI>Philadelphia, Buckingham, Chester, New∣castle, Kent</HI> and <HI>Sussex,</HI> containing about <HI>Four Thousand Souls. Two General Assemblies</HI> have been held, and with such <HI>Concord</HI> and <HI>Dispatch,</HI> that they sate but <HI>three Weeks,</HI> and at least <HI>seventy Laws</HI> were past without one Dissent in any material thing. But of this more hereafter, being yet <HI>Raw</HI> and <HI>New</HI> in our <HI>Geer:</HI> However, I cannot forget their singular Respect to me in this Infancy of things, who by their own private <HI>Expences</HI> so early consider'd <HI>Mine</HI> for the <HI>Publick,</HI> as to present me with an <HI>Impost</HI> upon certain Goods Imported and Exported: Which after my Acknowledgements of their Affection, I did as freely Remit to the <HI>Province</HI> and the <HI>Traders</HI> to it. And for the well Government of the said Counties, <HI>Courts</HI> of <HI>Justice</HI> are establisht in every County, with proper Officers, as <HI>Justices, Sheriffs, Clarks, Constables,</HI> &amp;c. which Courts are held every <HI>two Moneths:</HI> But to prevent Law Suits, there are <HI>three Peace-makers</HI> chosen by each County-Court, in the nature of common <HI>Arbitrators,</HI> to hear and end Differences betwixt man and man; and <HI>Spring</HI> and <HI>Fall</HI> there is an <HI>Orphan's Court</HI> in each County, to inspect and regulate the Affairs of <HI>Orphans</HI> and <HI>Widdows.</HI></P>
<P N="32">XXXII. <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> the Expectation of those that are concern'd in this <HI>Province,</HI> is at last <HI>laid out</HI> to the great Content of those here, that are any wayes Interested therein: The <HI>Scitu∣ation</HI> is a Neck of Land, and lieth between two Navigable Rivers, <HI>Delaware</HI> and <HI>Skulkill,</HI> where∣by it hath two Fronts upon the Water, each a <HI>Mile,</HI> and <HI>two</HI> from River to River. <HI>Delaware</HI> is a glorious River, but the <HI>Skulkill</HI> being an <HI>hundred Miles</HI> Boatable above the <HI>Falls,</HI> and its Course <HI>North-East</HI> toward the Fountain of <HI>Susquahannah</HI> (that tends to the Heart of the Pro∣vince, and both sides our own) it is like to be a great part of the Settlement of this Age. I say little of the Town it self, because a <HI>PLAT-FORM</HI> will be shewn you by my Agent, in which those who are <HI>Purchasers</HI> of me, will find their <HI>Names</HI> and <HI>Interest:</HI> But this I will say for the good Providence of God, that of all the many Places I have seen in the World, I remember not one better seated; so that it seems to me to have been appointed for a Town, whether we regard the <HI>Rivers,</HI> or the conveniency of the <HI>Coves, Docks, Springs,</HI> the loftiness and soundness of the <HI>Land</HI> and the <HI>Air,</HI> held by the People of these parts to be very good. It is advanced within less than a Year to about <HI>four Score Houses</HI> and <HI>Cottages,</HI> such as they are, where <HI>Merchants</HI> and <HI>Handicrafts</HI> are following their <HI>Vocations</HI> as fast as they can, while the <HI>Country-men</HI> are close at their <HI>Farms:</HI> Some of them got a little <HI>Winter-Corn</HI> in the Ground last Season, and the generality have had a handsom <HI>Summer-Crop,</HI> and are preparing for their <HI>Winter-Corn.</HI> They reaped their <HI>Barley</HI> this Year in the Moneth called <HI>May;</HI> the <HI>Wheat</HI> in the Moneth following; so that there is time in these parts for <HI>another Crop</HI> of divers Things before the <HI>Winter Season.</HI> We are daily in hopes of <HI>Shipping</HI> to add to our Number; for blessed be God, here is both <HI>Room</HI> and <HI>Accommodation</HI> for them; the <HI>Stories</HI> of our <HI>Necessity,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="5"/>being either the <HI>Fear</HI> of our <HI>Friends,</HI> or the <HI>Scar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-Crows</HI> of our <HI>Enemies;</HI> for the greatest hard∣ship we have suffered, hath been <HI>Salt-Meat,</HI> which by <HI>Fowl</HI> in <HI>Winter,</HI> and <HI>Fish</HI> in <HI>Summer,</HI> toge∣ther with some <HI>Poultry, Lamb, Mutton, Veal,</HI> and plenty of <HI>Venison</HI> the best part of the year, hath been made very pass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble.

You cannot imagin, my <HI>Station</HI> can be at present free of more than ordinary <HI>business,</HI> and as such, I may say, <HI>It is a trou∣blesom Work;</HI> but the <HI>Method</HI> things are putting in, will facilitate the Charge, and give an easier Motion to the <HI>Administration</HI> of <HI>Affairs.</HI> However, as it is some mens Duty to <HI>plow,</HI> some to <HI>sow,</HI> some to <HI>water,</HI> and some to <HI>reap;</HI> so it is the <HI>Wisdom</HI> as well as <HI>Duty</HI> of a man, to yield to the mind of <HI>Providence,</HI> and chearfully, as well as carefully imbrace and follow the Guidance of it.</P>
<P N="33">XXXIII. For your particular Concern, I might entirely refer you to the Letters of the <HI>President</HI> of the <HI>Society;</HI> but this I will venture to say, Your <HI>Provincial Settlements</HI> both within and without the Town, for <HI>Scituation</HI> and <HI>Soil,</HI> are without Exception: Your <HI>City-Lot</HI> is an <HI>whole Street,</HI> and one side of a <HI>Street,</HI> from <HI>River</HI> to <HI>River,</HI> containing near <HI>one hundred Acres,</HI> not easily valued, which is besides your <HI>four hundred Acres</HI> in the <HI>City-Liberties,</HI> part of your <HI>twenty thousand Acres</HI> in the <HI>Country.</HI> Your <HI>Tannery</HI> hath such plenty of <HI>Bark,</HI> the <HI>Saw-Mill</HI> for <HI>Timber,</HI> the place of the <HI>Glass-house</HI> so conveniently posted for <HI>Water-carriage,</HI> the <HI>City-Lot</HI> for a <HI>Dock,</HI> and the <HI>Whalery</HI> for a sound and fruitful <HI>Bank,</HI> and the Town <HI>Lewis</HI> by it to help your People, that by Gods blessing the Affairs of the <HI>Society</HI> will naturally grow in their <HI>Reputation</HI> and <HI>Profit.</HI> I am sure, I have not turned my back upon any <HI>Offer</HI> that tended to its <HI>Prosperity;</HI> and though I am ill at <HI>Projects,</HI> I have sometimes put in for a share with her <HI>Officers,</HI> to countenance and advance her <HI>Interest.</HI> You are already informed what is fit for you further to do, whatsoever tends to the Promotion of <HI>Wine,</HI> and to the Manufacture of <HI>Linnen</HI> in these parts, I cannot but wish you to promote it; and the <HI>French People</HI> are most likely in both respects to answer that design: To that end I would advise you to send for some <HI>Thousands</HI> of <HI>Plants</HI> out of <HI>France,</HI> with some able <HI>Vinerons,</HI> and People of the other <HI>Vocation:</HI> but because I believe you have been entertained with this and some other profitable Subjects by your <HI>President,</HI> I shall add no more, but to assure you, that I am heartily inclined to advance your <HI>just Interest,</HI> and that you will alway<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> find me</P>

<P>THe City of <HI>Philadelphia</HI> now extends in <HI>Length,</HI> from River to River, <HI>two Miles,</HI> and in <HI>Breadth</HI> near a <HI>Mile;</HI> and the <HI>Governour,</HI> as a further manifestation of his Kindness to the <HI>Purchasers,</HI> hath freely given them their respective <HI>Lots</HI> in the City, without defalcation of any their <HI>Quantities</HI> of <HI>purchased Lands;</HI> and as its now placed and modelled between <HI>two Navigable Rivers</HI> upon a Neck of Land, and that Ships may ride in good <HI>Anchorage,</HI> in <HI>six</HI> or <HI>eight Fathom Water</HI> in both Rivers, close to the City, and the Land of the City level, dry and wholsom; such a <HI>Scituation</HI> is scarce to be parallel'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Model</HI> of the <HI>City</HI> appears by a small <HI>Draught</HI> now made, and may hereafter, when time permits, be augmented; and because there is not room to express the <HI>Purchasers Names</HI> in the <HI>Draught,</HI> I have therefore drawn <HI>Directions</HI> of <HI>Reference,</HI> by way of <HI>Numbers,</HI> whereby may be known each mans <HI>Lot</HI> and <HI>Place</HI> in the <HI>City.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>City</HI> is so ordered now, by the <HI>Governour's Care</HI> and <HI>Prudence,</HI> that it hath a <HI>Front</HI> to each <HI>River,</HI> one half at <HI>Delaware,</HI> the other at <HI>Skulkill;</HI> and though all this cannot make way for <HI>small Purchasers</HI> to be in the <HI>Fronts,</HI> yet they are placed in the <HI>next Streets,</HI> contiguous to each <HI>Front, viz.</HI> all Purchasers of <HI>one Thousand Acres,</HI> and upwards, have the <HI>Fronts</HI> (and the <HI>High-street</HI>) and to every <HI>five Thousand Acres Purchase,</HI> in the <HI>Front</HI> about an <HI>Acre,</HI> and the <HI>smaller Purchasers</HI> about <HI>half an Acre</HI> in the <HI>backward Street;</HI> by which means the least hath room enough for <HI>House, Garden</HI> and <HI>small Orchard,</HI> to the great Content and Satisfaction of all here concerned.</P>
<P>The <HI>City</HI> (as the <HI>Model</HI> shews) consists of a <HI>large Front-street</HI> to each River, and a <HI>High-street</HI> (near the middle) from <HI>Front</HI> (or River) to <HI>Front,</HI> of <HI>one hundred foot broad,</HI> and <HI>a broad Street</HI> in the middle of the City, from <HI>side</HI> to <HI>side,</HI> of the like breadth. In the Center of the City, is a <HI>Square</HI> of <HI>Ten Acres;</HI> at each Angle are to be Houses for <HI>publick Affairs,</HI> as a <HI>Meeting-House, Assembly</HI> or <HI>State-House, Market-House, School-House,</HI> and several other Buildings for <HI>Publick Concerns.</HI> There are also in each Quarter of the City, a <HI>Square</HI> of <HI>eight Acres,</HI> to be for the like Uses, as the <HI>Moor-fields</HI> in <HI>London;</HI> and <HI>eight Streets</HI> (besides the said <HI>High-street</HI>) that run from <HI>front</HI> to <HI>front,</HI> and <HI>twenty Streets</HI> (besides the <HI>broad-street</HI>) that run cross the City, from <HI>side</HI> to <HI>side;</HI> all these Streets are of <HI>fifty Foot breadth.</HI></P>
<P>In each <HI>Number</HI> in the <HI>Draught,</HI> in the <HI>Fronts</HI> and <HI>High-street,</HI> are placed the <HI>Purchasers</HI> of <HI>One Thousand Acres,</HI> and upwards, to make up <HI>five Thousand Acres Lot,</HI> both in the said <HI>Fronts</HI> and <HI>High-street,</HI> and the <HI>Numbers</HI> direct to each <HI>Lot,</HI> and where in the City; so that thereby they may know, where their Concerns are therein.</P>
<P>The <HI>Front Lots</HI> begin at the <HI>South-ends</HI> of the <HI>Fronts,</HI> by the <HI>Numbers,</HI> and so reach to the <HI>North-ends,</HI> and end at <HI>Number</HI> 43. The <HI>Hight-street Lots</HI> begin towards the <HI>Fronts</HI> at <HI>Number</HI> 44. and so reach to the Center.</P>
<P>The <HI>lesser Purchasers</HI> begin at <HI>Number</HI> 1. in the <HI>second Streets,</HI> and so proceed by the <HI>Numbers,</HI> as in the <HI>Draught;</HI> the <HI>biggest</HI> of them being <HI>first placed,</HI> nearest to the <HI>Fronts.</HI></P>
