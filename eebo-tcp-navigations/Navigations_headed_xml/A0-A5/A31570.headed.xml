<HEAD>To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>IN this small Treatise the <HI>Reader</HI>
may not reasonably expect to
have his <HI>Fancy</HI> much delighted,
<Q>(Ornari res ipsa negat, contenta
doceri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>)</Q>
but only to have his <HI>Understanding</HI>
informed; and therefore the Author
hath industriously avoided all curious
<HI>Flowers of Rhetorick,</HI> and made it his
whole business to feed his Reader with
abundant variety of <HI>Excellent Fruits.</HI></P>
<P>Here are interspersed some Obser∣vations,
which though already known
to many English men, yet may be un∣known
to most <HI>Strangers</HI> and <HI>Forreign∣ers,</HI>
for the information of whom
<PB REF="6"/>
this Book is <HI>secondarily</HI> intended; and
for that end will shortly be translated
into the <HI>French Tongue;</HI> whereby
may be extinguisht in some measure
the Thirst which Forreigners general∣ly
have to know the <HI>Present State of</HI>
this <HI>Considerable Monarchy.</HI></P>
<P>Although the main aim is to inform
all men of the <HI>Present State</HI> of this
Kingdom, yet divers <HI>Reflections</HI> are
made upon the <HI>past State</HI> thereof,
that so by comparing that with the
present, some men may thereby not
only be moved to endeavour the <HI>Re∣stauration</HI>
of what was heretofore
better, and the <HI>abolition</HI> of what is
now worse; but also in some measure
may <HI>fore-see</HI> without consulting our
<HI>Astrologers</HI> and <HI>Apocalytick</HI> men, what
will be the <HI>future</HI> state of this Na∣tion:
according to that Excellent Say∣ing,
<HI>Qui respicit praeterita &amp; inspicit
praesentia, prospicit etiam &amp; futura.
<PB REF="6"/>
A good Historian by running back to
Ages past, and by standing still and
viewing the present times, and com∣paring
the one with the other, may then
run forward, and give a Verdict of the
State almost Prophetick.</HI></P>
<P>In the many Reflections upon the
Antient State of <HI>England,</HI> frequent
use is made of divers grave Authors,
as of <HI>Horn</HI> in his <HI>Mirror of Justice,</HI>
of <HI>Glanvile, Bracton, Britton, For∣tescue,
Linwood, Stamford, Smith,
Cosens, Camden, Cook, Spelman,
Selden, &amp;c.</HI> And for the <HI>present
State,</HI> Consultation was had with
several eminently learned Persona∣ges
yet living, to the end that the
Reader might receive at least some
satisfaction in every particular, with∣out
the trouble and charges of a
great <HI>Library.</HI> And as the Author
doth sometimes use both the <HI>Words</HI>
of the <HI>Living</HI> and the <HI>Writings▪</HI> of the
<PB REF="7"/>
<HI>Dead,</HI> without quoting any, to a∣void
Ostentation; so he hopes that
this ingenuous Confession being
made at first, no man will be offend∣ed
though he give no notice when the
Observation is theirs, and when it is
his own; having taken special care
that both in theirs and in his own,
there should be nothing but the
<HI>truth:</HI> so that although the Reader
not perceiving every where by what
Authority divers things are averred,
may be apt to suspect that some things
are <HI>gratis dicta,</HI> yet if it shall please him
to make search, he will find that ge∣nerally
they are <HI>vere &amp; cum authorita∣te
dicta.</HI></P>
<P>However in a Subject so <HI>multiform</HI>
as this, where so many Marks are
aimed at, no wonder if in some the
Author hath not hit the <HI>White;</HI> but
wheresoever it was missed, it is not
perhaps much wide there-from; and
<PB REF="7"/>
if in any thing by <HI>mis-information</HI> or
<HI>mis-observation</HI> there be any palpa∣ble
mistake (as <HI>humanum est errare)</HI>
it shall in the next Impression be du∣ly
corrected, if any Reader will be so
cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teous as to advertise either the
Author, the Printer, or Publisher, by
Letter or otherwise.</P>
<P><HI>Brevity</HI> and a <HI>Laconique Stile</HI> is
aimed at all along, that so there
might be <HI>Magnum in Parvo,</HI> that it
might be <HI>mole minimus,</HI> though <HI>Re
magnus;</HI> that the whole State of
<HI>England</HI> might be seen at once,
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or as in a Map; that
as it will be a necessary Book for all
Englishmen at all times: so every one
might without trouble alwayes carry
it about with him as a <HI>Companion</HI> to
consult upon all occasions.</P>

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat the Impositions were hea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ier,
for by reason of the great

the Soil of its own bounty,

(as in <HI>Holland)</HI> do ne∣cessitate

Moreover, of the <HI>English</HI>

that then it is <HI>happiest</HI> with

that old Riming Verse,
<Q>Anglica gens est optima flens

<P>The <HI>English</HI> Nation ancient∣ly
were and at this day are very

and to create <HI>Prodigies;</HI> and
then interpret them according
to their own extravagant con∣ceits;

any the most prodigious

of Divinity; some of
the inferiour sort of late holding
abominable opinions, unworthy
<PB N="36" REF="28"/>
even of men, and such as in no
Age were ever broacht before.</P>
<P>The <HI>English National Vices</HI>
were antiently <HI>Gluttony</HI> and the
effects thereof <HI>Lasciviousness,</HI>
(when they made four Meals in
a day and most excessive <HI>Feast∣ing,</HI>
with great plenty of <HI>French
Wine)</HI> when Women of <HI>pro∣fessed
Incontinency</HI> were permit∣ted
to proffer their Bodies to all
Comers, in certain places called
<HI>Stews</HI> or <HI>Stoves,</HI> or <HI>Bathing
places;</HI> because men were wont
to <HI>bath</HI> themselves there (as
still in other Countries) before
they addrest themselves to <HI>ve∣nereous
acts.</HI> Moreover <HI>Pride
in Apparel,</HI> wherein they were
anciently so extravagant and
foolish, that divers <HI>Statutes</HI> and
<HI>Homilies</HI> have been made a∣gainst
that Excess, and an
<PB N="37" REF="28"/>
English Man was wont to be pi∣ctured
naked with a pair of <HI>Tay∣lors
Sheers</HI> in his hand, and a
piece of Cloth under his arme,
with Verses annext, intimating
that he knew not what fashion
of Clothes to have.</P>
<P><HI>Excess of drinking</HI> was anci∣ently
more rare in <HI>England,</HI>
as appears by an old Poet,
<Q><L>Ecce Britannorum mos est
laudabilis iste,</L>
<L>Vt bibat arbitrio pocula
quisque suo.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Danes in the time of
King <HI>Edgar</HI> first brought it in,
but it was afterward banisht
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence, so that we find no anci∣ent
Statute against it; for
though the Statutes heretofore
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ade against Excess in <HI>Apparel</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="29"/>
and <HI>Dyet</HI> are ancient, yet
those against <HI>Drunkenness</HI> are
but of late date.</P>
<P>As the English returning
from the Wars in the <HI>Holy
Land,</HI> brought home the foul
disease of <HI>Leprosie,</HI> now almost
extinct here, though not yet in
our neighbouring Countries;
so in our Fathers dayes the <HI>En∣glish</HI>
returning from the Service
in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> brought
with them the foul Vice of
<HI>Drunkenness,</HI> as besides other
Testimonies, the Term of <HI>Ca∣rous,</HI>
from <HI>Gar ausz, All out,</HI>
learnt of the <HI>High-Dutch</HI> there
in the same Service; so <HI>Quaffe,
&amp;c.</HI> This Vice of late was
more, though at present too
much; insomuch that some
persons, and those of quality,
may not safety be visited in an
<PB N="39" REF="29"/>
Afternoon, without running
the hazard of Excessive drink∣ing
of <HI>Healths</HI> (whereby in a
short time twice as much liquor
is consumed as by the <HI>Dutch,</HI>
who sip and prate) and in some
places it is esteemed a piece of
wit to make a man drunk, for
which purpose some <HI>swilling in∣sipid
Trencher Buffoon</HI> is alwayes
at hand.</P>
<P>However it may be truly af∣firmed
that at present there is
generally less Excess in <HI>Drink∣ing</HI>
(especially about <HI>London</HI>
since the use of <HI>Coffee)</HI> less ex∣cess
in <HI>Dyet,</HI> but principally in
<HI>Apparel</HI> than heretofore: inso∣much
that the poor Tradesman
is much pincht thereby; for as
it is expedient for the benefit
of the whole Commonwealth,
that divers <HI>unnecessary</HI> and <HI>su∣perfluous</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="30"/>
Commodities should
be allowed, as <HI>'Tobacco, Coffee,
Spices, Sugars, Raisins, Silks,
&amp;c.</HI> so some less hurtful ex∣cesses
(as in <HI>Apparel, Dyet,
Building, Coaches, Lackeys,
&amp;c.</HI> must either be connived
at, or much of all the money
of the Nation must lie dead and
unemploied (as it now doth in
the <HI>private, sullen, niggardly
Non-Conformists</HI> hands) and
Tradesmen must either starve,
or be sustained by Almes.</P>

<HI>Easter</HI> will be on the 22 <HI>March,</HI>
as was this year 1668.</P>
<P>But the Romish Church fol∣lowing
new Rules for finding of
<HI>Easter,</HI> it happens sometimes
<PB N="66" REF="43"/>
that their <HI>Easter</HI> is full 5 weeks
before ours, and sometimes
with ours, but never after ours;
for Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> the 13th in
the year 1582, having obser∣ved
that upon exact account
the year contained above 365
dayes, not full 6 hours (as had
been from the time of <HI>Julius
Caesar</HI> hitherto reckoned) but
only 5 hours 49 minutes and
16 seconds, and that this diffe∣rence
of almost 11 minutes in
the space of about 134 years,
maketh one whole day, which
not considered since the Regu∣lation
of <HI>Easter,</HI> had brought
back the year at least 10 dayes;
insomuch that the <HI>Vernal Equi∣nox</HI>
which was at first on the
21 of <HI>March,</HI> was now on the
11th of <HI>March;</HI> by reason
whereof sometimes 2 Full
<PB N="67" REF="43"/>
Moons past between the <HI>Equi∣nox</HI>
and <HI>Easter,</HI> contrary to
the Primitive Institution there∣of;
which was, that <HI>Easter</HI>
should alwayes be observed on
the Sunday following the first
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ull Moon after the <HI>Vernal E∣quinox,</HI>
Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> then ha∣ving
observed these inconveni∣ences,
resolved at once to take
away 10 dayes, and that out of
the Moneth of <HI>October,</HI> by
calling the 5th day thereof the
15th, and that for that year
those Festivals which fell in
those 10 dayes, which by rea∣son
of the Vintage time were
but few, should be celebrated
upon the 15, 16, and 17th
dayes of that Moneth. And
that the <HI>Equinox</HI> might never
<HI>retrocede</HI> for the future, it was
then provided that every 400
<PB N="68" REF="44"/>
years 3 <HI>Bissextile years</HI> should
be left out; that is, in the
years 1700, 1800, and 1900,
and so again in 2100, 2200,

2000 to have its <HI>Bissextile,</HI> and
so every 400th year.</P>

before ours for the beginning
of Moneths, and for all Fixt
Festivals; but various for all
Moveable Festivals.</P>
<P><HI>Easter</HI> and the other <HI>Move∣able

find <HI>Easter</HI> by the Rules which
were generally received by all
Christendom, <HI>Anno</HI> 532, and
ever since till 1582, it was al∣tered
by the Pope as aforesaid,
yet cannot it be denied but that
this old Computation is be∣come
erroneous; for by our

one <HI>Easter</HI> to be observed this

<P>The <HI>Hebrews, Greeks,</HI> and

Owen, Owen ap Rhese, &amp;c.</HI> so
the <HI>Irish, Neal mac Con, Con

<P>As Christian Names were
first given for distinction of Per∣sons,
so Surnames for distin∣ction
of Families.</P>
<P>About <HI>Anno</HI> 1000 the
<HI>French</HI> Nation began to take
Surnames with <HI>de</HI> prefixt, as
at this day is their usual manner.
The English also took to them∣selves
Surnames, but not ge∣nerally
by the Common Peo∣ple,
till the Raign of <HI>Edw.</HI> 2.</P>
<P>At first, for Surnames the
English Gentry took the Name
of their Birth-place or Habita∣tion,
as <HI>Thomas</HI> of <HI>Aston</HI> or
<HI>East-Town, John</HI> of <HI>Sutton</HI> or
<HI>South-Town;</HI> and as they alter∣ed
their Habitation, so they
altered their Surname. After,
<PB N="77" REF="48"/>
when they became Lords of
places, they called themselves
<HI>Thomas Aston</HI> of <HI>Aston, John
Sutton</HI> of <HI>Sutton.</HI></P>
<P>The Common People for
Surnames added their Fathers
Name with <HI>Son</HI> at the end
thereof, as <HI>Thomas Johnson;
Robert Richardson.</HI> They also
oft took their Fathers Nick
Name or abbreviation, with
addition of s, as <HI>Gibs,</HI> the
Nick Name or abbreviation of
<HI>Gilbert, Hobs</HI> of <HI>Robert, Nicks</HI>
of <HI>Nicholas, Bates</HI> of <HI>Bartho∣lomew,
Sams</HI> of <HI>Samuel;</HI> and
thence also <HI>Gibson, Hobson,
Nickson, Batson, Samson, &amp;c.</HI>
Many also were surnamed from
their <HI>Trade,</HI> as <HI>Smith, Joyner,
Weaver, &amp;c.</HI> Or from their
<HI>Office,</HI> as <HI>Porter, Steward,
Sheepheard, Carter,</HI> or from
<PB N="78" REF="49"/>
their <HI>Place of Abode,</HI> as <HI>Atwood,
Atwell, Athill;</HI> which since
are shrunk into <HI>Wood, Wells,
Hill.</HI></P>
<P>The Normans at their first
coming into <HI>England</HI> brought
Surnames for many of their
Gentry with <HI>de</HI> prefixt, as the
French Gentry doth generally
at this day, and their Christian
Names were generally German;
they being originally descend∣ed
from a part of North <HI>Ger∣many.</HI>
And some for about
200 years after the Conquest,
took for Surname their Fathers
Christian Name, with <HI>Fitz</HI> or
<HI>Fils</HI> prefixt, as <HI>Robert Fitz-William,
Henry Fitz-Gerard,
&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Britains</HI> or <HI>Welsh</HI> more
lately civilized, did not take
Surnames till of late years, and
<PB N="79" REF="49"/>
that for the most part only, by
leaving out <HI>a</HI> in <HI>ap,</HI> and annex∣ing
the <HI>p</HI> to their Fathers Chri∣stian
Name; as instead of <HI>E∣van

<P>The most ancient Families

in <HI>England,</HI> are either
those that are taken from Pla∣ces

in <HI>France,</HI> and from
some other Transmarine Coun∣tries,

<P><Q>For the Transgressions of a
Land, many are the Princes or
Rulers thereof, <BIBL><HI>Prov.</HI> 28. 2.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Of Monarchies some are
<HI>Despotical,</HI> where the Subjects
like Servants are at the Arbi∣trary
Power and Will of their
Soveraign, as the <HI>Turks</HI> and
<HI>Barbarians:</HI> Others <HI>Political</HI> or
<HI>Paternal,</HI> where the Subject
like Children under a Father,
are governed by equal and just
Laws, consented and sworn
unto by the King; as is done by
all Christian Princes at their
Coronations.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="51"/>
Of <HI>Paternal</HI> Monarchies,
some are <HI>Hereditary,</HI> where
the Crown descends either on∣ly
to Heirs Male, as in <HI>France;</HI>
or next of Blood, as in <HI>Spain,
England, &amp;c.</HI> Others <HI>Elective,</HI>
where upon the death of every
Prince, without respect had

another by Solemn Election is
appointed to succeed, as in
<HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Hungary;</HI> and till
of late in <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Bo∣hemia.</HI></P>
<P>Of Hereditary <HI>Paternal</HI> Mo∣narchies,
some are <HI>dependent</HI>
and holden of Earthly Poten∣tates,
and are obliged to do
<HI>Homage</HI> for the same; as the
Kingdoms of <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Man,</HI>
that held <HI>in Capite</HI> of the
Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and the
Kingdome of <HI>Naples,</HI> holden of

the Pope; others <HI>independent,</HI>
holden only of God, acknow∣ledging

<P><HI>England</HI> is an <HI>Hereditary Pa∣ternal
Monarchy,</HI> governed by
one <HI>Supreme, Independent,</HI> and
<HI>Undeposable Head,</HI> according
to the known Laws and Cu∣stoms
of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>It is a <HI>Free</HI> Monarchy, chal∣lenging
above many other <HI>Eu∣ropean</HI>
Kingdoms, a freedom
from all Subjection to the <HI>Em∣perour</HI>
or Laws of the Empire;
for that the <HI>Roman Emperours</HI>
obtaining antiently the Domi∣nion
of this Land by force of
Arms, and afterwards aban∣doning
the same, the Right
by the Law of Nations return∣ed
to the former Owners <HI>pro de∣relicto,</HI>
as <HI>Civilians</HI> speak.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="52"/>
It is a Monarchy free from
all manner of Subjection to
the <HI>Bishop of Rome,</HI> and there∣by
from divers inconveniencies
and burdens, under which the
neighbouring Kingdoms groan;
as <HI>Appeals to Rome</HI> in sundry
<HI>Ecclesiastical Suits, Provisions,</HI>
and <HI>Dispensations,</HI> in several ca∣ses
to be procured from thence;
many <HI>Tributes</HI> and <HI>Taxes</HI> paid
to that Bishop, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>It is a Monarchy free from all
<HI>Interregnum,</HI> and with it from
many mischiefs whereunto E∣lective
Kingdoms are subject.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> is such a Monarchy,
as that, by the necessary
subordinate Concurrence of
the Lords and Commons in the
making and repealing all Sta∣tutes
or Acts of Parliament,
it hath the main advantages
<PB N="85" REF="52"/>
of an <HI>Aristocracy</HI> and of a <HI>De∣mocracy,</HI>
and yet free from the
disadvantages and evils of ei∣ther.</P>
<P>It is such a Monarchy, as by
a most admirable temperament
affords very much to the <HI>Indu∣stry,
Liberty,</HI> and <HI>Happiness</HI> of
the <HI>Subject,</HI> and yet reserves
enough for the <HI>Majesty</HI> and <HI>Pre∣rogative</HI>
of any King that will
own his people as Subjects, not
as Slaves.</P>
<P>It is a Kingdom that of all
the Kingdoms of the World is
most like the Kingdom of <HI>Je∣sus
Christs;</HI> whose yoke is easie,
whose burden is light.</P>
<P>It is a Monarchy that with∣out
interruption hath been con∣tinued
almost 1000 years, and
(till of late) without any at∣tempts
of change of that Go∣vernment:
<PB N="86" REF="53"/>
so that to this sort
of Government the English
seem to be naturally inclined,
and therefore during the late
<HI>Bouleversations</HI> or over-turn∣ings,
when all the art that the
Devil or Man could imagine,
was industriously made use of to
change this Monarchy into a
Democracy, this Kingdom in∣to
a Common-wealth, the
most and the best of English
Men, the general Spirit and
Genius of the Nation (not so
much the Presbiterian or Roy∣alist)
by mighty though invi∣sible
influence, concurred at
once to restore their exiled So∣veraign,

<P>He is as the Roman Empe∣rours

Max.</HI> He is the Supreme
<HI>Pastor</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and hath
not only Right of Ecclesiastical

some Ecclesiastical Functi∣on
so far as <HI>Solomon</HI> did, 1 <HI>Kings</HI>
8. when he blessed the People,
consecrated the Temple, and
pronounced that Prayer which
<PB N="104" REF="62"/>
is the Pattern now for Conse∣cration
of all Churches and

Offices are left to the <HI>Bi∣shops</HI>
and <HI>Priests,</HI> as the deter∣minination

if the Affairs of State did
not alwayes require his Presence
at the Helme; and the Admini∣stration
of Sacraments, Preach∣ing,
and other Church Offices
and Duties to the Bishops and
their Ordained Clergy.</P>
<P>Of this <HI>Sacred Person</HI> of the
King, of the <HI>life</HI> and <HI>safety</HI> there∣of,
the Laws and Customs of
<HI>England</HI> are of <HI>tender,</HI> that they
have made it <HI>High Treason,</HI> one∣ly
to <HI>imagine</HI> or <HI>intend</HI> the <HI>death</HI>
of the <HI>King.</HI> And because by
imagining or conspiring the
<PB N="105" REF="62"/>
death of the Kings <HI>Counsellors</HI> or
<HI>Great Officers</HI> of his <HI>Houshold,</HI>
the destruction of the King
hath thereby sometimes ensued,
and is usually aimed at (saith
<HI>Stat. 3 H. 7.)</HI> that also was
made <HI>felony,</HI> to be punisht
with death, although in all o∣ther
Cases Capital the Rule is
<HI>Voluntas non reputabitur pro fa∣cto;</HI>
and an English Man may
not in other Cases be punisht
with death, unless the Act fol∣low
the Intent.</P>
<P>The Law of <HI>England</HI> hath so
high esteem of the Kings <HI>Per∣son,</HI>
that to offend against
those <HI>Persons</HI> and those <HI>things</HI>
that represent his <HI>Sacred Per∣son,</HI>
as to kill some of the
<HI>Crown Officers</HI> or the <HI>Kings
Judges</HI> executing their Office,
or to counterfeit the <HI>Kings
<PB N="106" REF="63"/>
Seals,</HI> or his <HI>Moneys,</HI> is made
<HI>High Treason;</HI> because by all
these the Kings <HI>Person</HI> is repre∣sented:
and High Treason is in
the Eye of the Law so horrid,
that besides loss of Life and
Honour, Real and Personal
Estate, to the Criminal, <HI>his
Heirs</HI> also are to lose the same
for ever, and to be ranked a∣mongst
the <HI>Peasantry</HI> and <HI>Ig∣noble,</HI>
till the King shall please
to restore them. <HI>Est enim tam
grave crimen</HI> (saith <HI>Bracton) ut
vix permittitur haeredibus qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
vivant.</HI> High Treason is so
grievous a Crime, that the
Law not content with the Life
and Estate and Honour of the
Criminal, can hardly endure
to see his heirs survive him,</P>
<P>And rather than Treason a∣gainst
the Kings <HI>Person</HI> shall go
<PB N="107" REF="63"/>
unpunisht, the Innocent in
some Cases shall be punished;
for if an Idiot or Lunatick (who
cannot be said to have any
will, and so cannot offend) du∣ring
his Idiocy or Lunacy,
shall kill, or go about to kill
the King, he shall be punisht
as a Traytor; and yet being
<HI>Non compos mentis,</HI> the Law
holds that he cannot commit
Felony or Petit Treason, not
other sorts of High Treason.</P>
<P>Moreover, for the precious
regard of the <HI>Person</HI> of the
<HI>King,</HI> by an Antient Record it
is declared, that no <HI>Physick</HI>
ought to be administred to him,
without good <HI>Warrant,</HI> this
Warrant to be made by the
Advice of his <HI>Council;</HI> no o∣ther
Physick but what is menti∣oned

to prepare all things with their
own hands, and not by the
hands of any <HI>Apothecary;</HI> and
to use the assistance only of such
<HI>Chyrurgeons</HI> as are prescribed in
the Warrant.</P>
<P>And so precious is the <HI>Person</HI>
and <HI>Life</HI> of the King, that e∣very
Subject is obliged and
bound by his Allegeance to
defend his Person in his <HI>Natural</HI>
aswell as <HI>Politick</HI> Capacity with
his own <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Limbs;</HI>
wherefore the Law saith that
the <HI>life</HI> and <HI>member</HI> of every
<HI>Subject</HI> is at the service of the

&amp; Dulce erit pro Patre Patriae
mori,</HI> to lose life or limb in de∣fending
him from Conspiracies,
Rebellions, or Invasions, or in
the Execution of his Laws,

to Royalty, that they are

obliged to defend and
maintain all the Rights of the
Crown in possession, and to
endeavour the recovery of those
whereof the Crown hath been
dispossest, and when any King
hath not religiously observed
his duty in this point, it hath
proved of very dreadful conse∣quence;

the redress of the Church

The Title of <HI>Dii</HI> or <HI>Gods,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Divinity.</NOTE>
plurally is often in Holy Writ
by God himself attributed to
Great Princes, because as Gods
Vicars or <HI>Vice-dei</HI> upon Earth,
they represent the Majesty and
Power of the God of Heaven
and Earth: and to the end that
the people might have so much
the higher <HI>esteem</HI> and more re∣verend
<HI>awfulness</HI> of them; for
if that fails, all <HI>Order</HI> fails; and
thence all <HI>Impiety</HI> and <HI>Calamity</HI>

<P>The Substance of the Titles
of God was also used by the

as <HI>Divinitas nostra &amp; Aeterni∣tas
nostra, &amp;c.</HI> as imperfectly
and analogically in them, though
essentially and perfectly only in
God; and the good Christians
<PB N="137" REF="78"/>
of those times out of their ex∣cess
of respect, were wont to
swear by the Majesty of the
Emperour (as <HI>Joseph</HI> once by

<P>So the Laws of <HI>England</HI>
looking upon the King as <HI>a
God upon earth,</HI> do attribute
unto him divers excellencies
that belong properly to God
alone, as Justice in the Ab∣stract;
<HI>Rex Angliae non potest
cuiquam injuriam facere.</HI> So al∣so
Infallibility, <HI>Rex Angliae non

perfect, so the Law will have
no Imperfection found in the
King.</P>
<P>No Negligence or Laches,

or corruption of blood; for by

though just Attainders, and

<HI>ipso facto</HI> pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ged. No Nonage
or Minority, for his Grant of

not Politick Capacity,
cannot be avoided by Nonage▪
Higher than this the Law at∣tributeth
a kind of immortali∣ty
to the King, <HI>Rex Angliae
non moritur;</HI> his Death is in
Law termed the <HI>Demise</HI> of the
King, because thereby the
Kingdom is demised to ano∣ther:
He is said not subject to
<PB N="139" REF="79"/>
Death, because he is a Corpo∣ration
in himself that liveth for
ever, all <HI>Interregna</HI> being in
<HI>England</HI> unknown, the same
moment that one King dies,
the next Heir is King fully and
absolutely without any Corona∣tion,
Ceremony, or Act to be
done <HI>ex post facto.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, the Law seem∣eth
to attribute to the King a
certain <HI>Omnipresency,</HI> that the
King is in a manner every
where, in all his <HI>Courts of Ju∣stice,</HI>
and therefore cannot be
<HI>non-suited</HI> (as Lawyers speak)
in all his <HI>Palaces,</HI> and therefore
all Subjects stand bare in the
<HI>Presence Chamber,</HI> wheresoever
the <HI>Chair of State</HI> is placed,
though the King be many
miles distant from thence. He
hath a kind of universal <HI>influ∣ence</HI>
<PB N="140" REF="80"/>
over all his Dominions, e∣very
soul within his Territories
may be said to feel at all times
his <HI>Power</HI> and his <HI>Goodness, Om∣nium
Domos Regis Vigilia de∣fendit,
Omnium Otium illius
Labor, Omnium Delicias illius
Industria, Omnium vacationem
illius Occupatio, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>So a kind of <HI>Omnipotency,</HI>
that the King can as it were
raise men from death to life, by
pardoning whom the Law hath
condemned; can <HI>create</HI> to the
highest Dignity and <HI>annihilate</HI>
the same at pleasure.</P>
<P>Divers other semblances of
the <HI>Eternal Deity</HI> belong to
the King. He in his own Do∣minions
(as God) saith <HI>Vin∣dicta
est mihi,</HI> for all punish∣ments
do proceed from him in
some of his Courts of Justice,
<PB N="141" REF="80"/>
and it is not lawful for any Sub∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ect
to revenge himself.</P>
<P>So he onely can be Judge in
his own Cause, though he de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ver
his Judgement by the
Mouth of his Judges.</P>
<P>And yet there are some
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hings that the King of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
cannot do. <HI>Rex Angliae
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ihil injuste potest,</HI> and the King
cannot devest himself or his
Successors of any part of his
<HI>Regal Power, Prerogative,</HI> and
<HI>Authority</HI> inherent and annext
to the Crown: not that there
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s any defect in the Kings Pow∣er
(as there is none in Gods
Power, though he cannot lie,
nor do any thing that implies
Contradiction:) not but that
the King of <HI>England</HI> hath as ab∣solute
a power over all his Sub∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ects
as any <HI>Christian Prince
<PB N="142" REF="81"/>
rightfully,</HI> and <HI>lawfully</HI> hath o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
ever had: not but that he still
hath a kind of <HI>Omnipotency</HI> no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to be disputed, but adored by
his Subjects; <HI>Nemo quidem <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

Not but that the King
may do what he please, with∣out
either <HI>opposition</HI> or <HI>resist∣ance,</HI>
and without being que∣stioned
by his Subjects; for the
King cannot be <HI>impleaded</HI> for
any Crime; no <HI>Action</HI> lieth a∣gainst
his Person, because the
<HI>Writ</HI> goeth forth in his own
Name, and he cannot arrest
himself. If the King should
seize his Subjects Lands (which
<PB N="143" REF="81"/>
God forbid) or should take a∣way
his Goods, having no
Title by Law so to do, there
is no remedy. Onely this,

be Petitions and Supplications
made that His Majesty will be
pleased to rule according to
Law, which if he shall refuse
to do, it is sufficient that he
must expect that the King of
Kings will be the Avenger of
Oppressed Loyal Subjects.</P>
<P>But there are also divers
things which the King cannot
do, <HI>Salvo jure, Salvo Juramen∣to,
&amp; Salvâ Conscientia sua.</HI>
Because by Oath at his Coro∣nation,
<PB N="144" REF="82"/>
and indeed without a∣ny
Oath, by the Law of <HI>Na∣ture,
Nations,</HI> and of <HI>Christia∣nity;</HI>
he holds himself bound
(as do all other Christian
Kings) to protect and defend
his people, to do justice and to
shew mercy, to preserve Peace
and Quietness amongst them,
to allow them their just Rights
and Liberties, to consent to
the Repealing of bad Laws,
and to the Enacting of good
Laws. Two things especially
the King of <HI>England</HI> doth not
usually do without the consent
of his Subjects, <HI>viz. make
New Laws,</HI> and <HI>raise New
Taxes,</HI> there being something
of <HI>Odium</HI> in both of them;
the one seeming to diminish
the Subjects Liberty, and the
other his Property; therefore
<PB N="145" REF="82"/>
that all occasion of disaffecti∣on
towards the King (the
Breath of our Nosthrils and the
Light of our Eyes, as he is sti∣led)
might be avoided, it was
most wisely contrived by our
Ancestors that for both these
should Petitions and Supplica∣tions
be first made by the Sub∣ject.</P>
<P>These and divers other Pre∣rogative
rightfully belong and
are enjoyed by the King of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></P>
<P>Nevertheless the Kings of
<HI>England</HI> usually govern this
Kingdom by the ordinary
known <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Customs</HI> of
the Land (as the great God
doth the World by the Laws
of Nature) yet in some Cases
for the benefit not damage of
this Realm, they make use of

Horse, who are alwayes in Pay
and readiness to assist upon any
occasion) there are Guards of
Horse and Foot.</P>
<P>The <HI>Horse Guard,</HI> which
the French call <HI>Garde du Corps,</HI>
the Germans <HI>Lieb Guardy,</HI> we
corruptly. <HI>Life Gard,</HI> that is,
<HI>the Gard of the Kings Body,</HI> hath
consisted of 500 Horsemen, all
or most Gentlemen and old Of∣ficers,
commanded by the
Captain of the Guard, now
<HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI>
whose Pay is 30 <HI>s.</HI> a day, and
each Horseman 4 <HI>s.</HI> a day.
These Horse have been divided
into Three Parts, whereof 200
under the immediate Com∣mand
<PB N="288" REF="154"/>
of the Captain of the
Guard, 150 under Monsieur
<HI>le Marquis de Blancfort,</HI> and
150 under Sir <HI>Philip Howard,</HI>
whose Pay to each is 20 <HI>s.</HI> a
day.</P>
<P>Under the Captain of the
Guard are four Lieutenants,
Sir <HI>Thomas Sandis,</HI> Sir <HI>Gilbert
Gerard,</HI> Major General <HI>Eger∣ton,</HI>
and Sir <HI>George Hambleton,</HI>
the Cornet is Mr. <HI>Stanly,</HI> Bro∣ther
to the Earl of <HI>Derby;</HI> also
four Brigadeers.</P>
<P>The Office of the Captain
of the Life Guard is at all times
of War or Peace to wait upon
the Kings Person (as oft as he
rides abroad) with a considera∣ble
number of Horsemen well
armed and prepared against all
dangers whatsoever.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="154"/>
At home within the Kings
House it is thought fit that the
Kings Person should have a
Guard both above and below
Stairs.</P>
<P>In the Presence Chamber
therefore wait the Gentlemen
Pensioners carrying Pole-axes,
there are 50 who are usually
Knights or Gentlemen of good
Quality and Families; their
Office is to attend the Kings
Person to and from his Chappel
only as far as the Privy Cham∣ber;
also in all other Solemni∣ties:
their yearly Fee is 100 <HI>l.</HI>
to each. Over these there is a
Captain, usually some Noble∣man,
at present the Lord <HI>Bellas∣sis,</HI>
whose Fee is 200 <HI>l.</HI> yearly;
a Lieutenant Sir <HI>John Bennet,</HI>
his Fee 66 <HI>l. 13 s. 4 d.</HI> a
Standard-Bearer, Fee 100 <HI>l.</HI> a
<PB N="290" REF="155"/>
Pay-masters Fee 50 <HI>l.</HI> and a
Clerk of the Check.</P>
<P>Again in the first Room a∣bove
Stairs, called the <HI>Guard-Chamber,</HI>
attend the Yeomen
of the Guard, whereof there
are 250 men of the best quality
under Gentry, and of larger
Stature, wearing Red Coats,
after an Antient Mode, bearing
Halberds at home and Half-Pikes
in Progress, and alwayes
wearing a large Sword.</P>
<P>Their Pay is daily 2 <HI>s. 6 d.</HI></P>
<P>Their Captain the Lord,
<HI>Grandison.</HI></P>
<P>The Kings Palace Royal
<HI>(ratione Regiae Dignitatis</HI>) is ex∣empted
from all Jurisdiction of
any Court Civil or Ecclesiasti∣cal,
but only to the Lord
Steward, and in his absence to
<PB N="291" REF="155"/>
the Treasurer and Comptroller
of the Kings Houshold, with
the Steward of the <HI>Marshalsey,</HI>
who may by vertue of their Of∣fice,
without Commission hear
and determine all Treasons,
Felonies, Breaches of the
Peace, committed within the
Kings Court or Palace.</P>
<P>The Kings Court or House
where the King resideth, is ac∣counted
a place so sacred, that
if any man presume to strike a∣nother
within the Palace where
the Kings Royal Person resi∣deth,
and by such stroke only
draw blood, his right hand
shall be stricken off, and he
committed to perpetual prison
and fined. By the Antient
Laws of <HI>England</HI> only striking
in the Kings Court was punisht
with death and loss of goods.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="156"/>
To make the deeper impres∣sion
and terrour into mens
minds for striking in the
Kings Court, it hath been or∣dered
that the Punishment for
striking should be executed with
great Solemnity and Ceremony,
in brief thus:</P>
<P>The Sergeant of the Kings
Woodyard brings to the place
of execution a square Block,
a Beetle, Staple, and Cords to
fasten the hand thereto, the
Yeoman of the Scullery pro∣vides
a great fire of Coals by
the Block, wherein the Searing
Irons brought by the Chief
Farrier, are to be ready for the
Chief Surgeon to use. Vinegar
and Cold Water brought by
the Groom of the Saucery; the
Chief Officers also of the Cel∣lar
and Pantry are to be ready,
<PB N="293" REF="156"/>
one with a Cup of Red Wine,
and the other with a Manchet,
to offer the Criminal after the
Hand cut off and the Stump
seared. The Sergeant of the
Ewry is to bring linnen to wind
about and wrap the Arm. The
Yeoman of the Poultry a Cock
to lay to it, the Yeoman of the
Chandry seared Clothes, the
Master Cook a sharp Dresser
Knife, which at the place of
Execution is to be held upright
by the Sergeant of the Larder,
till Execution be performed by
an Officer appointed thereto,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the Kings Court not on∣ly
striking is forbidden but also
all occasions of Striking, and
therefore the Law saith, <HI>Nullas
Citationes aut summonitiones li∣cet
facere infra Palatium Regis
<PB N="294" REF="157"/>
apud Westm, vel alibi ubi Rex
residet.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Court of the King of</HI>
England <HI>for Magnificence, for
Order, for Number and Qua∣lity
of Officers, for rich Furni∣ture,
for Entertainment and Ci∣vility
to Strangers, for plenti∣ful
Tables, might compare with
the best Court of</HI> Christendom,
<HI>and far excel the most Courts
abroad; of one whereof, see
the Description made by an in∣genious
Person beyond Sea,
writing to a Friend of his at
Court there,</HI> Annon in Inferno

<P>But the Court of <HI>England</HI>
on the contrary hath been (and
is hoped ever will be) accoun∣ted
(as King <HI>James</HI> adviseth in
his <HI>Basilicon Doron</HI>) a <HI>Pattern</HI> of
<HI>Godliness</HI> and all <HI>Honesty</HI> and
<PB N="296" REF="158"/>
<HI>Vertue,</HI> and the properest

<P>The Court of <HI>England</HI> hath
for a long time been a <HI>Pattern</HI>
of <HI>Hospitality</HI> to the <HI>Nobility</HI>
and <HI>Gentry</HI> of <HI>England.</HI> All
Noblemen or Gentlemen, Sub∣jects
or Strangers that came ac∣cidently
to Court, were freely
entertained at the plentiful Ta∣bles
of His Majesties Officers.
Divers Services or Messes of
Meat were every day provided
Extraordinary for the Kings ho∣nour.
Two hundred and forty
Gallons a day were at the But∣try
Barr allowed for the Poor,
besides all the broken Meat,
Bread, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> gathered into Bas∣kets
and given to the Poor at
<PB N="297" REF="158"/>
the Court Gates by 2 Grooms
and 2 Yeomen of the Almon∣ry,
who have Salaries of His
Majesty for that Service.</P>
<P>Moreover the Court is an
eminent <HI>Pattern</HI> of <HI>Charity</HI> and
<HI>Humility</HI> to all that shall see the
performance of that Antient
Custom by the King and the
Queen on the Thursday before
<HI>Easter,</HI> called <HI>Maundy Thursday,</HI>
wherein the King in a solemn
manner doth wash the Feet,
cloth and feed as many poor
Old Men as His Majesty is years
old, bestowing on every one
Cloth for a Gown, Linnen for
a Shirt, Shooes, and Stock∣ings,
a Joul of Salmon, a Pol
of Ling, 30 Red and 30 White
Herrings, all in clean Wooden
Dishes, 4 Six Penny Loaves of
<PB N="298" REF="159"/>
Bread, and a Purse with a 20 <HI>s.</HI>
Piece of Gold.</P>
<P>The Magnificence and abun∣dant
plenty of the Kings Ta∣bles
hath caused amazement in
all Forreigners, when they have
been informed that yearly was
spent of gross Meat 1500 Ox∣en,
7000 Sheep, 1200 Veals,
300 Porkers, 400 Sturks or
young Biefes, 6800 Lambs 300
Flitches of Bacon, and 26
Boares. Also 140 Dozen of
Geese, 250 Dozen of Capons,
470 Dozen of Hens, 750 Do∣zen
of Pullets, 1470 Dozen
of Chicken. For Bread 36400
Bushels of Wheat, and for
Drink 600 Tun of Wine and
1700 Tun of Beer. Moreo∣ver
of Butter 46640 Pounds,
together with Fish and Fowl,
Venison, Fruit, Spice, pro∣portionable.
<PB N="299" REF="159"/>
This prodigious
plenty caused Forreigners to
put a higher value upon the
King, and caused the Natives
who were there freely welcome,
to encrease their affection to
the King, it being found as ne∣cessary
for the King of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
this way to endear the
English, who ever delighted
in Feasting; as for the Italian
Princes by Sights and Shews to
endear their subjects, who as
much delight therein.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Three States
of England.</HEAD>
<P>ALl the Subjects of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
are divided into
<HI>Clergy</HI> and <HI>Laity;</HI> The Laity
sub-divided into <HI>Nobility</HI> and
<HI>Commonalty.</HI> These are called
<HI>Ordines Regni,</HI> or the <HI>Three
States,</HI> and first of the Clergy.</P>
<P>As <HI>Heaven</HI> is more honoura∣ble
than <HI>Earth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Clergy <HI>their</HI> Dignity.</NOTE> the <HI>Soul</HI> than
the <HI>Body;</HI> so is the <HI>Spiritual</HI>
Function more excellent than
the <HI>Civil,</HI> and the <HI>Sacerdotal</HI>
Dignity higher than the <HI>Secu∣lar:</HI>
and therefore in <HI>England</HI>
the <HI>Clergy caeteris paribus,</HI> hath
<PB N="327" REF="173"/>
ever had (according to the pra∣ctice
of all other Civilized Na∣tions
since the World began)
the preference and precedence
of the <HI>Laity,</HI> and hath in all
times been reputed the First of
the Three States.</P>
<P>The <HI>Clergy</HI> so called,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Name.</NOTE> because
they are Gods <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <HI>Portion:</HI>
For although all Christians may
be stiled Gods Portion as well
as Gods Servants; yet amongst
Christians those Persons whom
God hath set apart and separa∣ted
from common use to his
Service, to be as it were his
Domestick Servants; are more
peculiarly the Lords Portion:
and therefore from the first Age
of Christianity, the Persons so
set apart, have been called <HI>Cle∣rici,</HI>
Clerks.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="174"/>
As in the <HI>State,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Degrees.</NOTE> so in the
<HI>Church,</HI> the Laws and Consti∣tutions
of <HI>England</HI> would not
that there should be a <HI>parity</HI> and
<HI>equality</HI> of all persons. <HI>Quippe
in Ecclesia nihil magis inaequale
quam aequalitas.</HI> And therefore in
conformity to the first Times
and Places of Establisht <HI>Christi∣anity,</HI>
so soon as the <HI>Christian
Faith</HI> was by Authority recei∣ved
in <HI>England,</HI> one of the
Clergy was in every City or∣dained
a <HI>Bishop;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bishop.</NOTE> who hath (to
avoid Confusion, which usually
springs from equality) a pre-e∣minence
over the rest of the
Clergy within certain Pre∣cincts.</P>
<P>Afterwards the Bishops be∣ing
necessitated to meet about
Publick Affairs of the Church,
<PB N="329" REF="174"/>
as <HI>Consecrations, Consultations</HI>
for remedy of general disor∣ders,
for <HI>Audiences Judicial,</HI>
when the actions of any Bishop
should be called in question;
or <HI>Appeals</HI> from Bishops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
It seemed requisite to our An∣cestors
(according to other
Christian Churches (ever since
the first <HI>Nicene Council</HI>) to
have amongst a certain number
of Bishops, one to be chiefest
in Authority over the rest;
f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om thence named <HI>Archiepis∣copus,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Archbi∣shop.</NOTE> Arch or Chief Bishop.</P>
<P>For easing the Bishop of
some part of his burthen, as
the number of Christians wax∣ed
great, or the Diocess was
large, there were ordained in
the Primitive Times <HI>Chorepis∣copi,
Suffragan,</HI> or <HI>Subsidiary</HI>
Bishops. Accordingly in the
<PB N="330" REF="175"/>
English Church of a long time
there have been such ordained
by the name of Bishops <HI>Suf∣fragans</HI>
or <HI>Titular</HI> Bishops;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suffra∣gan Bi∣shop.</NOTE>
who have the Name, Title,
Stile, and Dignity of Bishops,
and (as other Bishops) are con∣secrated
by the Archbishop of
the Province; each one to ex∣ecute
such Power, Jurisdicti∣on,
and Authority, and re∣ceive
such Profits as is limited
in his Commission by the Bi∣shop
or Diocesan, whose Suf∣fragan
he is.</P>
<P>For a Supply of able and fit
Persons to assist Bishops, or to
be made Bishops, it seemed
good to Reverend Antiquity,
that in every Diocess a certain
number of the more prudent
and pious Pastors should be
placed in a <HI>Collegiate</HI> manner at
<PB N="331" REF="175"/>
every <HI>Cathedral</HI> or <HI>Episcopal
See;</HI> where they might not on∣ly
be ready to assist the Bishop
in certain weighty Cases; but
also fit themselves (by gaining
experience and loosing by little
and little their former familia∣rity
with the inferiour Coun∣trey
Clergy) for Government
and Authority in the Church.</P>
<P>Accordingly in every <HI>Cathe∣dral</HI>
Church in <HI>England,</HI> there
are a certain number of <HI>Preben∣daries</HI>
or <HI>Canons,</HI> and over
them a <HI>Dean,</HI> in Latine <HI>Deca∣nus,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dean.</NOTE> from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; because anti∣ently
set over ten Canons at
the least: who is sometime sti∣led
<HI>Alter Episcopi Oculus,</HI> the
other being the <HI>Archdeacon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Archdea∣con.</NOTE>
who (though a <HI>Presbyter</HI> him∣self)
is so named for his Charge
over the <HI>Deacons;</HI> who are to
<PB N="332" REF="176"/>
be guided and directed by him
under the Bishop.</P>
<P>Next is the <HI>Rural Dean,</HI>
who was antiently called <HI>Ar∣cbipresbyter,</HI>
and had the guid∣ance
and direction of the <HI>Pres∣byters.</HI></P>
<P>In the last place are the Pa∣stors
of every Parish, who are
called <HI>Rectors,</HI> unless the <HI>Pre∣dial</HI>
Tythes be <HI>impropriated,</HI>
and then they are called <HI>Vicars,
quasi vice fungentes Rectorum.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>England</HI> are 2 <HI>Archbi∣shops,
24 Bishops,</HI> no <HI>Suffragan
Bishops</HI> at present; 26 <HI>Deans</HI>
of Cathedrals and Collegiate
Churches, 60 <HI>Archdeacons,</HI>
544 Prebendaries, many <HI>Ru∣ral
Deans,</HI> and about 9700
<HI>Rectors</HI> and <HI>Vicars,</HI> besides
<HI>Curates,</HI> who for certain Sti∣pends
assist such Rectors and
<PB N="333" REF="176"/>
Vicars that have the care of
more Churches than one.</P>
<P>These (if it be considered of
what great Learning and Abili∣ties
they are; what great Au∣thority
and Sway they usually
bear over the Laity, to incline,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead, and draw them; what
great Priviledges and Immuni∣ties
they do or ought to enjoy,
and how much means they pos∣sess)
may well be reputed, as
in all times they have been in all
other States, the first Member
of the Three Estates of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></P>
<P>It hath been provided,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Privi∣ledges of the Cler∣gy.</NOTE> not
without singular wisdom, that as
the ordinary course of common
affairs is disposed of by general
Laws; so likewise mens rarer
incident Necessities and Utilities
<PB N="334" REF="177"/>
should be with special equity
considered. Hence is it that
so many <HI>Priviledges, Immuni∣ties,
Exemptions,</HI> and <HI>Dispen∣sations</HI>
have been to the Cler∣gy
of <HI>England</HI> granted in all
times: Our Ancestors thinking
it very reasonable that as <HI>Soul∣diers</HI>
were wont by the <HI>Roman
Emperours</HI> to be endowed with
certain <HI>Priviledges</HI> for their
warding and fighting to pre∣serve
the State from <HI>external</HI>
Enemies, so the Clergy ought
to have certain Immunities and
Priviledges for their <HI>watching</HI>
and <HI>spiritual</HI> Warfare to pre∣serve
the State from <HI>internal</HI>
Enemies the <HI>World,</HI> the <HI>Flesh,</HI>
and the <HI>Devil; Ut serventur

<P>Of <HI>Priviledges</HI> some belong

<P>Before the coming of the
<HI>Savons</HI> into <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Archbi∣shop.</NOTE> the <HI>Chri∣stian
Britains</HI> had 3 Archbi∣shops,
<HI>viz.</HI> of <HI>London, York,</HI>
and <HI>Caerleon,</HI> an antient great
City of <HI>South-Wales</HI> upon the
River <HI>Uske.</HI> Afterward the
<HI>Archiepiscopal See</HI> of <HI>London</HI>
was by the <HI>Saxons</HI> placed at
<PB N="336" REF="178"/>
<HI>Canterbury,</HI> for the sake of St.
<HI>Austin</HI> the Monk, who first
preached the Gospel there to
the <HI>Heathen Saxons,</HI> and was
there buried. The other of
<HI>Caerleon</HI> was translated to St.
<HI>Davids</HI> in <HI>Pembroke-Shire,</HI> and
afterward subjected wholly to
the See of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> since
which all <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI>
reckon but 2 Archbishops, <HI>Can∣terbury</HI>
and <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>The Archbishop of <HI>Canter∣bury</HI>
antiently had <HI>Primacy</HI> as
well over all <HI>Ireland</HI> as <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Canter∣bury.</NOTE> and the Irish Bishops re∣ceived
their <HI>Consecrations</HI> from
him; for <HI>Ireland</HI> had no other
Archbishop until the year
1152, and therefore in the
time of the 2 first <HI>Norman</HI>
Kings, it was declared that
<PB N="337" REF="178"/>
<HI>Canterbury</HI> was the <HI>Metropolitan</HI>
Church of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI>
and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the Isles ad∣jacent.
He was therefore some∣times
stiled a <HI>Patriarch</HI> (and <HI>Pa∣triarcha</HI>
was a Chief Bishop o∣ver
several Kingdoms or Pro∣vinces
(as an Archbishop is o∣ver
several Dioceses) and had
several Archbishops under him;
was sometimes called, <HI>Alterius
Orbis Papa &amp; Orbis Britannici
Pontifex;</HI> and matters done
and recorded in Ecclesiastical
affairs, ran thus, <HI>Anno Pon∣tificatus
Nostri primo secundo,
&amp;c.</HI> He was <HI>Legatus Natus,</HI>
that is, a perpetual <HI>Legantine</HI>
Power was annext to that
Archbishoprick near 1000
years ago; whereby no other
<HI>Legat, Nuncio,</HI> or <HI>Ambassa∣dour</HI>
from the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI>
<PB N="338" REF="179"/>
could here exercise any <HI>Legan∣tine</HI>
Power, without special
Licence from the King. He was
so highly respected abroad, that
in General Councils he was pla∣ced
before all other Archbi∣shops
at the Popes right Foot.
He was at home so highly ho∣noured
by the Kings of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
that (according to the
Practice of Gods own People
the Jews, where <HI>Aaron</HI> was next
in Dignity to <HI>Moses,</HI> and ac∣cording
to the practice of most
other <HI>Christian</HI> States; where
the next in Dignity and Au∣thority
to the Sovereign, is
usually the chiefest Person of
the Clergy) he was accounted
the <HI>Second Person</HI> in the King∣dome,
and named and ranked
even <HI>before</HI> the <HI>Princes of the
Blood.</HI> He enjoyed some spe∣cial
<PB N="339" REF="179"/>
marks of <HI>Royalty,</HI> as to be
<HI>Patron</HI> of a <HI>Bishoprick</HI> (as he
was of <HI>Rochester:</HI>) to <HI>Coyn
Moneys,</HI> and to have the Ward∣ships
of all those who held
Lands of him <HI>Jure Hominii</HI>
(as it is called) although they
held in <HI>Capite</HI> other Lands of
the King; a <HI>Princely</HI> Preroga∣tive,
even against the Kings
written Prerogative.</P>
<P>In an antient <HI>Charter</HI> grant∣ed
by <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Conquerour</HI>
to <HI>Lanfranc</HI> Archbishop of
<HI>Canterbury,</HI> he is to hold his
Lands with the same freedom
<HI>in Dominico suo</HI> (as the words
are) as the King holdeth his
<HI>in Dominico suo,</HI> except only
in 2 or 3 Cases, and those of
no great importance.</P>
<P>It is an Antient Priviledge of
the See of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> that
<PB N="340" REF="180"/>
wheresoever any Mannors or
Advowsons do belong unto
that See, that place forthwith
becomes exempt from the Or∣dinary,
and is reputed a Pecu∣liar,
and of the Diocess of <HI>Can∣terbury.</HI></P>
<P>The Archbishop of <HI>Canter∣bury</HI>
by the favour of our Kings
is judged fit to enjoy still divers
considerable Pre-eminencies.
He is <HI>Primat</HI> and <HI>Metropolitan
over all England,</HI> and hath a
super-eminency and some Pow∣er
even over the Archbishop of
<HI>York;</HI> hath power to summon
him to a National Synod, and
<HI>Archiepis. Eboracensis venire
debet cum Episcopis suis ad nu∣tum
ejus, ut ejus Canonicis dis∣positionibus
obediens existat.</HI></P>
<P>The Archbishop of <HI>Canterbu∣ry</HI>
is at this day <HI>Primus par Reg∣ni,</HI>
<PB N="341" REF="180"/>
the first <HI>Peer</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and
next to the Royal Family to pre∣cede
not only all <HI>Dukes,</HI> but all
the <HI>Great Officers</HI> of the Crown.</P>
<P>He is stiled by the King in
his Writs directed to him, <HI>Dei
Gratiâ Archiepisc. Cant.</HI> and
writes himself <HI>Divina Provi∣dentia,</HI>
whereas other Bishops
write <HI>Divinâ Permissione;</HI> and
he is said to be <HI>inthroned,</HI> when
he is invested in the Archbi∣shoprick.</P>
<P>To Crown the King belongs
to him, and it hath been resol∣ved
that wheresoever the
Court shall happen to be, the
King and Queen are <HI>Speciales

<HI>Holy Offerings</HI> made at the Al∣tar
by the King and Queen,
wheresoever the Court should
<PB N="342" REF="181"/>
happen to be, if his Grace was
there present. Also the Power
of appointing the <HI>Lent Preach∣ers,</HI>
as thought by our Ance∣stors
much more fit for a Pre∣late
or Spiritual Person to do,
(as in all other Christian
Courts) then for any Lay
Lord, as hath been used in
<HI>England</HI> since one <HI>Cromwell</HI> was
by <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. made Vicar Gene∣ral,
and placed above the

<P>The Bishop of <HI>London</HI> is ac∣counted
his Provincial <HI>Dean,</HI>
the Bishop of <HI>Winchester</HI> his
<HI>Chancellour,</HI> and the Bishop of

<P>The next in place amongst
the Clergy of <HI>England</HI> are the
Bishops, so called from the
Saxon word <HI>Biscop,</HI> and that
from the Greek <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Spe∣culator,
Explorator vel Superin∣tendens,</HI>
an Officer amongst

<P><PB N="351" REF="185"/>
All the Bishops of <HI>England</HI>
are Barons and Peers of the
Realm. They are Barons by a
threefold manner (which can∣not
be said of the Lay Lords)
they are <HI>Feodal</HI> in regard of
their Lands and Baronies an∣next
to their Bishopricks.
They are <HI>Barons by Writ,</HI> be∣ing
summoned by the Kings
Writ to Parliament, and they
are <HI>created Barons by Patent,</HI>
which at their <HI>Consecration</HI> is al∣wayes
exhibited to the Arch∣bishop.
They have the Pre∣cedence
of all Temporal Ba∣rons
under Vicounts. In the
Parliament have place in the
<HI>Upper House</HI> in a <HI>double</HI> capaci∣ty,
not only as Barons, but as
Bishops; for before they were
Barons, they had in all times
place in the Great Council of
<PB N="352" REF="186"/>
the Kingdome: and there ever
placed on the Kings <HI>right hand,</HI>
not only to give their Advice
as the Judges do, but <HI>ad tra∣ctandum,
ordinandum, statuen∣dum,
definiendum,</HI> &amp;c. They
have the Title of <HI>Lords</HI> and
<HI>Right Reverend Fathers.</HI></P>
<P>All Bishops in <HI>England</HI> have
one or two transcendent Privi∣ledges,
which seem almost <HI>Re∣gal;</HI>
as, In their own Courts to
judge and pass Sentence alone
by themselves, without any
<HI>Collegue</HI> or <HI>Assessor;</HI> which is
not done in other of the Kings
Courts: for the Bishops Courts
(though held by the Kings
Authority <HI>Virtute Magistratus
sui</HI>) are not accounted to be
<HI>properly</HI> the Kings Courts, and
therefore the Bishops send forth
Writs in their own Names,
<PB N="353" REF="186"/>
<HI>Teste</HI> the Bishop, and not in
the Kings Name; as all the
Kings Courts properly so called
do.</P>
<P>Moreover Bishops have this
other transcendent Priviledge,
To depute their Authority to
another (as the King doth) ei∣ther
to their <HI>Bishops Suffragans,</HI>
to their <HI>Chancellours,</HI> to their
<HI>Commissaries</HI> or other Officers;
which none of the Kings
Judges may do.</P>
<P>All Bishops have one Privi∣ledge
above and beyond all
Lay Lords, <HI>viz.</HI> That in
whatsoever Christian Princes
Dominions they come, their
Episcopal Dignity and Degree
is acknowledged; and they
may, <HI>quatenus Bishops,</HI> confer
<HI>Orders, &amp;c.</HI> whereas no Lay
<HI>Baron, Vicount, Marquiss,</HI> nor
<PB N="354" REF="187"/>
<HI>Duke,</HI> is in Law acknowledge∣ed
such out of the Dominions
of the Prince who conferred
those Honours.</P>
<P>The Laws and Customs of
<HI>England</HI> are so tender of the
Honour, Credit, Reputation,
and Person of Bishops our Spi∣ritual
Fathers, that none might
(without special Licence from
the King first obtained) be
endited of any Crime before
any Temporal Judge.</P>
<P>Upon severe Penalty by our
Laws no man may raise re∣ports,
whereby <HI>Scandal</HI> may
arise to the Person of any
Bishop, or Debate and Discord
between them and the Com∣mons
of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>In Civil Trials, where a Bi∣shop
is Plaintiff or Defendant,
the Bishop may as well as any

with burning Tapers in their

as followeth,</HI> By the

of the Son, and of the Holy

anathematize, and sequester from
Our Holy Mother the Church, all

in Deed, Word, or Counsel, those

Ecclesiastical Liberties, &amp;c.
granted by Our Lord the King
to the Archbishops, Bishops, Pre∣lates,

put Our Seals. <HI>After
which all throwing down their

be extinct and stink in Hell.</P>
<P>Since which all Kings of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
at their Coronations have
by Solemn Oaths promised to
preserve the same, and they

Antiently men were very
tender and fearful to do any
thing that might make them
incur the said dreadful censure;
but of later times, especially
since our Reformation, many
men pretending to more Chri∣stianity,
and to more know∣ledge,
have made little consci∣ence

very little violated) have been
exacted, even to Sedition and

plentiful maintenance of a

Hospitality was kept, many

Works. All Leases held of

sufficient to serve the whole

<P>The Bishopricks of <HI>England</HI>
have been also since the later
end of <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. to the coming
in of King <HI>James,</HI> most mise∣rably
robbed and spoiled of the
greatest part of their Lands and
Revenues; so that at this day
a mean Gentleman of 200 <HI>l.</HI>
land yearly, will not change his
worldly estate and condition
with divers Bishops: an At∣tourney,
a Shop-Keeper, a
common Artisan; will hardly
change theirs with ordinary Pa∣stors
of the Church.</P>
<P>Some few Bishopricks do yet
retain a competency, amongst
which the Bishoprick of <HI>Dur∣ham</HI>
is accounted one of the
<PB N="386" REF="203"/>
Chief, the yearly Revenues
whereof before the late trou∣bles
was above 6000 <HI>l.</HI> of
which by the late Act for abo∣lishing
Tenures in <HI>Capite,</HI> was
lost above 2000 <HI>l.</HI> yearly. Out
of it an yearly Pension of 880
<HI>l</HI> is paid to the <HI>Crown</HI> ever
since the Raign of Queen <HI>Eli∣zabeth,</HI>
who promised in lieu
thereof so much in <HI>Impropri∣ations;</HI>
which was never per∣formed.
Above 340 <HI>l.</HI> yearly
paid to several Officers of the
County Palatine of <HI>Durham,</HI>
The Assises and Sessions duly
kept in the Bishops House, at
the sole Charges of the Bi∣shop.
The several expences
for keeping in repair certain
Banks of Rivers in that Bi∣shoprick,
and of several Hou∣ses
belonging to the Bishoprick.
<PB N="387" REF="203"/>
Moreover the yearly Tenths,
the Publick Taxes, the Char∣ges
of going to, and waiting
at Parliament, being deducted,
there will remain <HI>communibus
annis</HI> to the Bishop to keep
Hospitality▪ (which must be
great) and to provide for those
of his Family but about 1500 <HI>l.</HI>
yearly. The like might be
said of some other Principal
Bishopricks.</P>
<P>The great diminution of the
Revenues of the Clergy and
the little care of augmenting
or defending the Patrimony of
the Church, is the great re∣proach
and shame of the En∣glish
Reformation, and will
one day prove the ruin of
Church and State.</P>
<P>Judicious Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> (who
in the Preface of his Works
<PB N="388" REF="204"/>
fore-told our late troubles 40
years before they came to pass)
observing in his time how the
Church was every day robbed
of her Dues, and that it was
then an opinion rife <HI>[That to
give to the Church smelt of Ju∣daisme
and Popery, and to take
from the Church what our Ance∣stors
had given, was Reformati∣on.]</HI>
declared that what <HI>Moses</HI>
saith in the 90th Psalme, was
likely to be verified of <HI>Religi∣on</HI>
and <HI>Gods Service</HI> amongst
us. The time thereof may be
<HI>Threescore years and ten,</HI> if it
continue till <HI>Fourscore</HI> it will be
but small joy to those that shall
then behold the Condition of
the <HI>English Church;</HI> and the
best read Historian cannot pro∣duce
one example of a happy
<HI>State,</HI> where the <HI>Clergy</HI> hath
<PB N="389" REF="204"/>
been exposed to the peoples
<HI>Contempt;</HI> which must needs
happen where their <HI>Benefices</HI>
their <HI>Maintenance</HI> is <HI>scandalous</HI>
and their <HI>Persons despicable.</HI></P>
<P>It is the last Trick saith St.
<HI>Gregory,</HI> that the Devil hath in
this World, when he cannot
bring the <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Sacraments</HI>
in disgrace by <HI>Errours</HI> and <HI>He∣resies,</HI>
he invented this Project,
to bring the <HI>Clergy</HI> into con∣tempt
and low esteem, as it is
now in <HI>England;</HI> where they
are accounted by many as the
<HI>dross</HI> and <HI>refuse</HI> of the <HI>Nation:</HI>
Men think it a stain to their
blood, to place their Sons in
that Function, and Women a∣shamed
to marry with any of
them; whereas antiently in
<HI>England</HI> (as among the Jews,
the Tribe of <HI>Levi</HI> was counted
<PB N="390" REF="205"/>
Noble, above all other Tribes
except that of the Royal Tribe
of <HI>Judah</HI>) the Function of the
Clergy was of so high account
and esteem, that not only the
best Gentry and Nobility, but
divers of the <HI>Sons</HI> and <HI>Brothers</HI>
of divers of our English Kings
since the Conquest and before,
disdained not to enter into <HI>Ho∣ly
Orders,</HI> and to be Clergy∣men,
as at this day is practised
in most other Monarchies of
Christendome. <HI>Ethelwolph</HI> Son
and Successor to <HI>Egbert,</HI> first sole
King of <HI>England,</HI> was in Holy
Orders and Bishop of <HI>Winche∣ster</HI>
at his Fathers death. <HI>Odo</HI>
Bishop of <HI>Bayeux</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI>
was Brother to <HI>William</HI> the
<HI>Conquerour. Henry de Blois</HI>
Brother to King <HI>Stephen</HI> was
Bishop of <HI>Winchester. Geofry
<PB N="391" REF="205"/>
Plantagenet</HI> Son to <HI>Henry</HI> 2
was Bishop of <HI>Lincoln. Henry
de Beaufort</HI> Brother to <HI>Henry</HI>
the 4th, was Bishop also of
<HI>Winchester.</HI> And of later Times
that most prudent <HI>Henry</HI> 7 had
designed his second Son to be
a Clergyman, to omit many
others of Noble Blood.
Which Policy is still observed
even amongst the few Families
of the Romish Religion in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
wherein are to be found
at this day some Brothers or
Sons of <HI>Dukes, Marquisses,
Earls,</HI> and <HI>Barons</HI> in Holy Or∣ders,
and all the rest of the
Stock of <HI>Baronets, Knights,</HI>
or <HI>Gentry;</HI> and for this cause
find respect not only amongst
those of their own Opinions;
but even of the more sober,
moderate, and best civilized
<PB N="392" REF="206"/>
Protestants. Whilst this Policy
lasted in <HI>England,</HI> the Clergy
were judged the fittest Persons
to execute most of the Chief
Offices and Places of the King∣dom
(according to the Divine
Policy amongst Gods peculiar
People, where the Priests and
Levites were the Principal Of∣ficers
and Judges in every
Court; to whom the People
were to be obedient on pain of
death) and the Laity did with
much reverence and respect
submit to them. And as then
<HI>Os Sacerdotis, Oraculum erat

the Weal of the Kingdom and
the Service of the King de∣pended
so much upon them,
and their presence for that end
so oft required at <HI>London,</HI> it
was judged expedient that
every Bishoprick should have a
Palace or House belonging to
it in or about <HI>London;</HI> and it is
known at this day where stood
the Houses of every one, ex∣cept
<PB N="394" REF="207"/>
that of St. <HI>Asaph,</HI> which
also might probably have had
one, but more obscure than
some other; that Bishoprick
having been, as still, very
mean.</P>
<P>Great was the <HI>Authority</HI> of
the <HI>Clergy</HI> in those dayes, and
their <HI>Memory</HI> should be <HI>precious</HI>
in these dayes, if we consider
that they were the Authors of
so great benefits and advanta∣ges
to this Kingdom, that
there are few things of any
importance for promoting of
the welfare of this Church and
State, wherein the Bishops and
Prelats; under God, have not
been the <HI>Principal Instruments.</HI>

their antient and present

as most of the best endowed
<HI>Colledges</HI> in both our <HI>Vniver∣sities,</HI>
very many <HI>Hospitals,
Churches, Palaces, Castles,</HI>
have been founded and built
by Bishops; even that famous
chargeable and difficult Stru∣cture
of <HI>London-Bridge</HI> stands
obliged to the liberal Contri∣butions
of an Archbishop; and
it was a <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> at
whose earnest request <HI>William</HI>
the <HI>Conquerour</HI> granted to the
City of <HI>London</HI> so large Privi∣ledges,
that in a grateful re∣membrance
thereof, the <HI>Lord

<P>But above all, The Con∣verting
<HI>England</HI> to the Christi∣an
Religion, the Reforming
that Religion when corrupted,
and since that, the maintenance
of the Doctrine thereof against
all Romish Writers, and of the
Discipline thereof (none of the
least good Offices) against all
the Practices and Power of the
Puritan and Presbyterian Fa∣ctions,
and all those other Se∣ctaries
lineally descended from
them; all this and more is ow∣ing
(if not solely, yet principal∣ly)
to Bishops and Prelats: by
the late want of whom to sit
at the Stern, how soon was
this goodly Vessel split upon
<PB N="398" REF="209"/>
the Rocks of Anarchy and
Confusion.</P>
<P>Even since the late Restau∣ration
of Bishops, to set down
the many considerable Publick
Benefits flowing from them
and other Dignified Clergy,
would tire the Reader.</P>
<P>What Sums of Money have
been by them expended in
repairing Cathedral Churches,
Episcopal Houses, in founding
and building Hospitals, in Cha∣rity
to poor Widdows of Cler∣gymen
utterly ruined by the
late Rebels, for redeeming of
poor Christian Slaves at <HI>Algier,</HI>
what publick and private Sums
for supplying the Kings Neces∣sities
at his Restauration, what
Expences in Hospitality, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
above and beyond the Charity
and Bounty of others, who
<PB N="399" REF="209"/>
have ten times their Wealth
and Riches.</P>
<P>As they have then been be∣neficial
to this Kingdome a∣bove
and beyond other ranks
of men, so they have had the
highest respect, reverence, and
esteem.</P>
<P>In all Ages amongst all
Nations, amongst <HI>Turks,</HI> as
well as <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Christians,</HI> it
was judged fit that the Princi∣pal
<HI>Domestique Servants</HI> of the
King of Heaven and Earth ei∣ther
should be of the <HI>Chiefest</HI>
and <HI>Noblest</HI> upon Earth, or at
least should be so esteemed.</P>
<P>Such <HI>Reverence</HI> our Ance∣stors
bare to that Function,
that (as <HI>Selden</HI> observes) to
fall down and <HI>kiss the Feet,</HI> was
a Ceremony usual towards o∣ther
Bishops and Principal Pre∣lates
<PB N="400" REF="210"/>
besides the Bishop of
<HI>Rome.</HI> Divers of our Saxon
and Norman Kings and Nobles
so respected them, that they
constrained them in <HI>Publick
Grants,</HI> yet to be seen to <HI>sign</HI>
before the highest of the <HI>Lay
Nobles,</HI> and sometimes before
the Kings own Sons and Bro∣thers,
and to rank them be∣fore,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1200. three

respect to <HI>Hugh</HI> Bishop
of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> disdained not with
their own <HI>Royal Shoulders</HI> to
bear his dead Corps to the

<P>And yet it hath been obser∣ved
even by <HI>Strangers,</HI> that
the <HI>Iniquity</HI> of the <HI>present times
<PB N="401" REF="210"/>
in England</HI> is such, that the

the one side, and maligned by
the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> on the other
side (as the English <HI>Liturgy</HI>

by both of them (a sure evi∣dence

In Civil Causes they are

in his lawful absence to
constitute a Proxy to vote for

supposed in the Law of
their attendance on the Person

Civil Law nor Common Law
allow any others Testimony to

of a Peer of <HI>England</HI> given in

Loyalty of their Chivalry, and
to put in their Answer to a

an Oath; though of later
times that Priviledge, by the
neglect of some Lords hath
been infringed sometimes. A
day of Grace by the favour of
the Court is not to be granted
to the Plaintiff in any Suit or
Action wherein a Peer of the
Realm is Defendant; and this
by Statute Law, because the
Law presumes that a Peer of
the Realm must alwayes be rea∣dy
to attend the Person of the
King and the Service of the
<PB N="421" REF="220"/>
Commonwealth, and there∣fore
it is not to be delayed
longer than the ordinary use of
the Court, but to have expe∣dition
of Justice. At the be∣ginning
of Parliament when
the Oath of Supremacy is ex∣acted
of all those of the House
of Commons, yet is it not re∣qnired
of any of the Lords, be∣cause
the King is otherwise as∣sured
of their Loyalty and Fi∣delity
as is presumed. In all
Cases wherein the Priviledge
of Clergy is allowed to other
men, and also in divers Cases
where that Priviledge is taken
away from other men, every
Peer of the Realm having
Place and Voice in Parlia∣ment,
shall upon his Request

<P>A Peer cannot be outlawed

and considering the Charges and
Expences appertaining to the
several Degrees of Honour, as
they belong to Men of Principal
Service to the King and Realm,
both in time of War and Peace,
expected that each of them
should have a convenient Estate
and Value of Lands of Inheri∣tance,
for the support of their
Honours and the Kings Service.
Therefore antiently when the
intrinsique value of a Pound
<HI>Sterling</HI> was worth 30 <HI>l.</HI> of our
Money now, every Knight
was to have about 800 Acres,
reckoned at 20 <HI>l.</HI> yearly in
Land, that is, about 600 <HI>l.</HI> of
<PB N="452" REF="236"/>
our Money at this day: A Ba∣ron
to have 13 Knights Fees
and one third part, which a∣mounted
to 400 <HI>l.</HI> which mul∣tiplied
by 30, was as much as
8000 <HI>l.</HI> a year at this day. An
Earl 20 Knights Fees, and a
Duke 40. And in case of de∣cay
of Nobility, or that they
had so far wasted their Reve∣nues,
that their Honours could
not decently be maintained (as
the Roman Senators were in
such case removed from the
Senate) so sometimes some
English Barons have not been
admitted to sit in the Higher
House of Parliament, though
they kept the Name and Title
of Dignity still.</P>
<P>For the better support o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
these Degrees of Honour, the
King doth usually upon the
<PB N="453" REF="236"/>
Creation of a Duke, Marquiss,
Earl, or Vicount, grant an
Annuity or yearly Rent to
them and their heirs, which is
so annext to the Dignity that
by no Grant, Assurance, or a∣ny
manner of Alienation can be
given from the same, but is still
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncident to, and a support of the
same Creation; contrary to
that Principle in Law, <HI>That e∣very
Land of Feesimple may be
charged with a Rent in Fee∣simple
by one way or other.</HI></P>
<P>To a Duke the King grants
40 <HI>l.</HI> heretofore a considera∣ble
Pension, to a Marquiss 40
Marks, to an Earl 20 <HI>l.</HI> and
to a Vicount 20 Marks. To
Barons no such Pensions is or∣dinarily
granted, onely the

Blount</HI> (the late Earl of <HI>New∣port</HI>)

<P>As the King of <HI>England</HI> hath
ever had the repute of the
richest in Domaines of any King
in <HI>Europe,</HI> so the Nobility of

the richest in Lands of any
Neighbouring Nation; some
having above 20000 <HI>l.</HI> yearly,
others 15000, and so many of
them above ten, that if one
with another they have 10000
<HI>l.</HI> yearly, it will amount to in
all amongst the 160 Lords Six∣teen

a year, about the ninth part of
the yearly Revenue of all <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>

<HI>Knights of the Garter.</HI></P>
<P>This Order is esteemed the
most Honourable and most An∣tient
of any now in use in <HI>Chri∣stendom.</HI>
It began as appears in
<PB N="464" REF="242"/>
the Statutes of this Order in
the 23th year of the Warlike
and Puissant King <HI>Edward</HI> 3,
who was Founder thereof, and
at first made choice of the most
Illustrious Persons of <HI>Europe,</HI>
to be of that <HI>Royal Society</HI> (no
doubt) upon a Martial, and not
upon any such Amorous Ac∣count,
as is intimated <HI>Page</HI> 96
of this Treatise, which ridicu∣lous
Story, to the dishonour of
the Order, was first fancied by
<HI>Polydore Virgil;</HI> and since upon
his credit taken up by many
late Authors.</P>
<P>It appears by Antient Wri∣tings
that this Honourable
Company is a Colledge or
Corporation, having a Great
Seal belonging to it, and con∣sisting
of a Soveraign Guardian
<PB N="465" REF="242"/>
(which is alwayes the King of
<HI>England</HI>) and of 25 Compa∣nions
called <HI>Knights of the Gar∣ter,</HI>
of 14 Secular Canons, that
are Priests, of 13 Vicars who
are also Priests; of 26 poor
Knights, who have no other
Maintenance but the allowance
of this Colledge, which is gi∣ven
them in respect of their
Prayers, to the Honour of God
and of St. <HI>George,</HI> who is the
Patron of <HI>England</HI> and of this
Order in particular; and is none
of those Fabulous St. <HI>Georges</HI>
as some have vainly fancied;
but that famous Saint and Sol∣dier
of Christ St. <HI>George</HI> of <HI>Cap∣padocia,</HI>
a Saint so universally
received in all Parts of <HI>Chri∣stendom,</HI>
so generally attested
by the Ecclesiastical Writers of
all Ages from the time of his
<PB N="466" REF="243"/>
Martyrdome till this day, that
no one Saint in all the Calen∣dar
(except those attested by
Scripture) can be better eviden∣ced.</P>
<P>There be also certain Offi∣cers
belonging to this Order,
as the Prelate of the Garter,
which Office is settled on the
Bishoprick of <HI>VVinchester.</HI> A
Chancellour of the Garter, A
Register, who of later times
hath been constantly the Dean
of <HI>VVindsor,</HI> though antiently
it was otherwise. The Princi∣pal
King at Arms called <HI>Gar∣ter,</HI>
whose chief function is to
manage and marshal their So∣lemnities
at their Installations
and Feasts. Lastly, The Usher
of the Garter.</P>
<P>There are also certain Orders
and Constitutions belonging to
<PB N="467" REF="243"/>
this Society touching the So∣lemnities
in making these
Knights, their Duties after
Creation, and their high Pri∣viledges,
too long for this
place.</P>
<P>The Colledge is seated in
the Castle of <HI>VVindsor,</HI> with
the Chappel of St. <HI>George,</HI>
there erected by King <HI>Edward</HI>
3. and the Chapter House.</P>
<P>The Order of the Garter is
wont to be bestowed upon the
most excellent and renowned
Persons for Honour and Ver∣tue;
and with it a Blew Garter
deckt with Gold, Pearl, and
Pretious Stones, and a Buckle
of Gold, to be worn daily on
the Left Leg; also at High
Feasts they are to wear a Sur∣coat,
a Mantle, a Black Vel∣vet
Cap, a Coller of Garters,
<PB N="468" REF="244"/>
and other stately and magnifi∣cent
Apparel.</P>
<P>They are not to be seen a∣broad
without their Garter up∣on
the Left Leg, upon pain of
paying 2 Crowns to any Offi∣cer
of the Order who shall first
claim it; onely in taking a
Journey a Blew Ribon under
the Boot doth suffice.</P>
<P>Upon the Left Shoulder,
upon Cloak, Coat, or Riding
Cassack in all places of Assem∣bly,
when they wear not their
Robes, they are to wear an
Escutcheon of the Arms of
St. <HI>George,</HI> that is, a Cross
with a Garter, and this by an
Order made <HI>April</HI> 1626. That

about the said Escutcheon now
worn, and called the Star or ra∣ther

their Scutcheons with the

<P>The Title of Gentleman in

<P>The State of Gentry was an∣tiently
such, that it was ac∣counted
an abasing of Gentry
to put their Sons to get their
Living by Shop-keeping, and
our Law did account it a dispa∣ragement
of a Ward in Chi∣valry
to be married to a Shop∣keepers
Daughter, or to any
meer Citizen; for Tradesmen
in all Ages and Nations have
been reputed ignoble, in regard
of the doubleness of their
Tongue, without which they
cannot grow rich (for <HI>Nihil
proficiunt nisi admodum menti∣untur,</HI>
as <HI>Tully</HI> observed) and
therefore amongst the <HI>Thebans</HI>
<PB N="479" REF="249"/>
no man was admitted to places
of Honour or Trust, unless he
had left off trading ten years
before: So by the Imperial
Laws a Tradesman is not ca∣pable
of any Honourable Estate,
nor to be a Commander over
Souldiers; and therefore the
English Nobility and Gentry
till within late years, judged it a
stain and diminution to the ho∣nour
and dignity of their Fa∣milies,
to seek their Childrens
support by Shop-keeping, but
only (as in all great Monarchies)
by Military, Court, State, or
Church Emploiments, much
less to subject their Children
to an Apprentisage, a perfect
Servitude; for during that
time, whatever they gain by
their Masters Trade or their

that a Gentleman thereby lo∣ses
his Gentility for ever, till
he can otherwise recover it;
and yet to the shame of our

of Pedling Trades, far more fit
for Women and their Daugh∣ters,
but also an Earl of this

<PB N="481" REF="250"/>
but the folly of the English in
swerving from their Ancestors
steps herein (as in other things)
is now apparent, for those young

<P>TOuching the Women of

things considerable in the En∣glish
Laws and Customs, Wo∣men
in <HI>England</HI> with all their
Moveable Goods, so soon as

disposition of the Husband.</P>
<P><PB N="498" REF="259"/>
If any Goods or Chattels be
given to Feme Covert to a
Married Woman, they all im∣mediately
become her Hus∣bands.
She cannot let, set,
sell, give away, or alienate a∣ny
thing, without her Hus∣bands
consent.</P>
<P>Her very Necessary Apparel
by the Law is not hers in pro∣perty.
If she hath any Tenure
at all, it is <HI>in Capite,</HI> that is,
she holds it of and by her Hus∣band,
who is <HI>Caput mulieris;</HI>
and therefore the Law saith <HI>Ux∣or
fulget radiis mariti.</HI></P>
<P>All the Chattels personal
the Wife had at the Marriage,
is so much her Husbands, that
after his death they shall not re∣turn
to the Wife, but go to the
Executor or Administrator of
the Husband, as his other
<PB N="499" REF="259"/>
Goods and Chattels, except
only her <HI>Parapherna,</HI> which are
her Necessary Apparel, which
with the consent of her Hus∣band
she may devise by Will;
not otherwise by our Law; be∣cause
the property and possessi∣on
even of the <HI>Parapherna</HI> are
in him.</P>
<P>The Wife can make no Con∣tract
without her Husbands
consent, and in Law matters
<HI>sine viro respondere non potest.</HI></P>
<P>The Law of <HI>England</HI> suppo∣seth
a Wife to be in so much
Subjection and Obedience to
her Husband, as to have no
will at all of her own: Where∣fore
if a Man and his Wife com∣mit
a felony together, the
Wife by the Law can be nei∣ther
Principal nor Accessory,
the Law supposing that in re∣gard
<PB N="500" REF="260"/>
of the subjection and obe∣dience
she owes to her Hus∣band,
she was necessitated
thereunto.</P>
<P>The Law of <HI>England</HI> suppo∣ses
in the Husband a power o∣ver
his Wife, as over his Child
or Servant, to correct her
when she offends; and there∣fore
he must answer for his
Wives faults, if she wrong a∣nother
by her Tongue or by
Trespass, he must make satis∣faction.</P>
<P>So the Law makes it as high a
Crime, and allots the same pu∣nishment
to a Woman that
shall kill her Husband, as to a
Woman that shall kill her Fa∣ther
or Master, and that is
Petty Treason, and to be burnt
alive.</P>
<P><PB N="501" REF="260"/>
So that a Wife in <HI>England</HI> is
<HI>de jure</HI> but the best of Servants,
having nothing her own in a
more proper sense than a Child
hath, whom his Father suffers
to call many things his own, yet
can dispose of nothing.</P>
<P>The Woman upon Marriage
loseth not onely the power o∣ver
her person and her will, and
the property of her Goods, but
her very Name; for ever after
she useth her Husbands Sur∣name,
and her own is wholly
laid aside; which is not obser∣ved
in <HI>France</HI> and other Coun∣tries,
where the Wife sub∣scribes
her self by her Paternal
Name; as if <HI>Susanna</HI> the
Daughter of <HI>R. Clifford</HI> be
married to <HI>E. Chamberlayn,</HI> she
writes her self <HI>Susanna Clifford
Chamberlayn.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="502" REF="261"/>
Notwithstanding all which,
their condition <HI>de facto</HI> is the
best in the World; for such is
the good nature of Englishmen
towards their Wives, such is
their tenderness and respect,
giving them the uppermost
place at Table and elsewhere,
the right hand every where, and
putting them upon no drudge∣ry
and hardship; that if there
were a <HI>Bridge</HI> over into <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
as aforesaid, it is thought
all the Women in <HI>Europe</HI> would
run thither.</P>
<P>Besides in some things the
Laws of <HI>England</HI> are above o∣ther
Nations so favourable to
that Sex, as if the Women
had voted at the making of
them.</P>
<P>If a Wife bring forth a
Child during her Husbands ab∣sence,
<PB N="503" REF="261"/>
though it be for some
years within <HI>England,</HI> and not
beyond the Seas, that Husband
must father that Child.</P>
<P>If a Wife bring forth a Child
begotten by any other before
Marriage, yet the present Hus∣band
must own the Child, and
that Child shall be his Heir at
Law.</P>
<P>The Wife after her Hus∣bands
death may challenge the
third part of his yearly Rents
of Lands during her life, and
within the City of <HI>London</HI> a
third part of all her Husbands
moveables for ever.</P>
<P>As the Wife doth partici∣pate

so likewise of his Condition.
If he be a Duke, she is a Dutch∣ess;

of Honour for want of Males
descend to Females; but to
<PB N="505" REF="262"/>
one of them onely, because
they are things in their own na∣ture
entire, and not to be di∣vided
amongst many (as the
Lands and Tenements are
which descend to all the
Daughters equally) besides by
dividing Dignities, the Repu∣tation
of <HI>Honour</HI> would be
lost, and the Strength of the
<HI>Realm</HI> impaired; for the <HI>Ho∣nour</HI>
and <HI>Chevalry</HI> of the <HI>Realm</HI>
doth chiefly consist in the <HI>No∣bility</HI>
thereof.</P>
<P>By Marriage all Women are
Noble, who take to their Hus∣bands
any Baron or Peer of the
<HI>Realm;</HI> but if afterwards they
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Men not Noble, they
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their former Dignity, and

Husband; for <HI>eodem modo
distolvitur earum Nobilitas, quo
<PB N="506" REF="263"/>
constituitur.</HI> But Women No∣ble
by Creation, or Descent,
or Birthright, remain Noble,
though they marry Husbands
under their Degree; for such
Nobility is accounted <HI>Character
indelebilis.</HI> Here note, that by
the Courtesie of <HI>England</HI> a
Woman Noble only by Mar∣riage
alwayes retaineth her
Nobility; but if the Kings
Daughter marry a Duke or an
Earl, <HI>illa semper dicitur Rega∣lis,</HI>
as well by Law as Cour∣tesie.</P>
<P>Noble women in the Eye of
the Law are as Peers of the
Realm, and are to be tried by
their Peers, and to enjoy most
other Priviledges, Honour, and
Respect as their Husbands▪
Only they cannot by the opini∣on
of some great Lawyers
<PB N="507" REF="263"/>
maintain an Action upon the
Statute <HI>De Scandalo Magnatum,</HI>
the Makers of that Statute
meaning only to provide in that
Case for the Great Men, and not
for the Women, as the words
of that Statute seem to import.
Likewise if any of the Kings
Servants within his Check Roll
should conspice the death of
any Noblewoman, this were
not Felony, as it is, if like
Conspiracy be against a Noble∣man.</P>
<P>None of the Wives Digni∣ties
can come by Marriage to
their Husbands, although all
their Goods and Chattels do;
onely the Wives Lands are to
descend to her next Heir: yet
is the Courtesie of <HI>England</HI>
such, that as the Wife for her
Dower hath the third part of
<PB N="508" REF="264"/>
her Husbands Lands during her
life; so the Husband (for the
Dignity of his Sex, and for
playing the Man in begetting
his Wife with Child, which
must appear by being born a∣live)
shall have all his Wives
Lands (for his Dower, if it
may be so called) during his
life.</P>
<P>By the Constitutions of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
married persons are so fast
joyned, that they may not be
wholly separated by any agree∣ment
between themselves, but
only by Sentence of the Judge,
and such separation is either <HI>a
Vinculo Matrimonii,</HI> and that
is <HI>ob praecontractum, vel ob
contractum per metum effectum,
vel ob frigiditatem, vel ob affi∣nitatem
sive Censanguinitatem,
vel ob Saevitiam;</HI> or else such
<PB N="509" REF="264"/>
separation is <HI>a Mensa &amp; Thoro,</HI>
and that is <HI>ob Adulterium.</HI></P>
<P>The Wife in <HI>England</HI> is ac∣counted
so much one with her
Husband, that she caunot be
produced as a witness for or a∣gainst
her Husband.</P>

<HEAD>Concerning Children in
England.</HEAD>
<P>The Condition of Children
in <HI>England,</HI> is different from
those in our Neighbour Coun∣tries.</P>
<P>As Husbands have a more
absolute Authority over their
Wives and their Estates, so
Fathers have a more absolute
Authority over their Children.
Fathers may give all their E∣states
from their own Children,
<PB N="510" REF="265"/>
and all to any one Child, and
none to the rest; the conside∣ration
whereof keeps the Chil∣dren
in great awe.</P>
<P>Children by the Common
Law of <HI>England</HI> are at certain
ages enabled to perform cer∣tain
Acts.</P>
<P>A Son at the age of 14 may
choose his Guardian, may claim
his Lands holden in <HI>Socage,</HI> may
consent to Marriage, may by
Will dispose of Goods and
Chattels.</P>
<P>At the age of 15 he ought
to be sworn to his Allegeance
to the King.</P>
<P>At 21 he is said to be of full
age, may then make any Con∣tracts,
may pass not only
Goods but Lands by Will,
which in other Countries may
not be done till the <HI>Annus con∣sistentiae,</HI>
<PB N="511" REF="265"/>
the age of 25, when
the heat of youth is somewhat
abated, and they begin to be
staied in mind as well as in
growth.</P>
<P>A Daughter at 7 years is to
have aid of her Fathers Tenants
to marry her, for at those years
she may consent to Marriage,
though she may afterwards dis∣sent.</P>
<P>At 9 she is dowable, as if
then or soon after she could <HI>vi∣rum
sustinere,</HI> and thereby <HI>Do∣tem
promereri.</HI></P>
<P>At 12 she is enabled to rati∣fie
and confirm her former con∣sent
given to Matrimony, and
if at that age she dissent not, she
is bound for ever; she may then
make a Will of Goods and
Chattels.</P>
<P><PB N="512" REF="266"/>
At 14 she may receive her
Lands into her own hands, and
is then out of Wardship, if she
be 14 at the death of her An∣cestor.</P>
<P>At 16 (though at the death of
her Ancestor she was under 14)
she shall be out of Wardship;
because then she may take a
Husband who may be able to
perform Knights-service as well
as hers.</P>
<P>At 21 she is enabled to con∣tract
or alienate her Lands by
Will or otherwise.</P>
<P>The Eldest Son inherits all
Lands, and to the younger
Children are disposed Goods
and Chattels, and commonly
the Eldest Sons Wives Portion;
and besides they are carefully e∣ducated
in some Profession or
Trade▪</P>
<P><PB N="513" REF="266"/>
If there be no Son, the Lands
as well as Goods are equally di∣vided
amongst the Daughters.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Concerning Servants in
England.</HEAD>
<P>The Condition of Servants
in <HI>England</HI> is much more favou∣rable
than it was in our Ance∣stors
dayes, when it was so bad,
that <HI>England</HI> was called the
Purgatory of Servants, as it
was and is still the Paradise of
Wives, and the Hell for Horses.</P>
<P>Ordinary Servants are hired
commonly for one year, at the
end whereof they may be free
(giving warning 3 Moneths be∣fore)
and may place themselves
with other Masters; only it is
accounted discourteous and un∣friendly
to take another Mans
<PB N="514" REF="267"/>
Servant, before leave given
by his former Master; and in∣discreet
to take a Servant with∣out
a Certificate of his diligence
and of his faithfulness in his Ser∣vice
to his former Master.</P>
<P>All Servants are subject to be
corrected by their Masters and
Mistresses, and resistance in a
Servant is punisht with severe
penalty; but for a Servant to
take away the life of his or her
Master or Mistris, is accounted
a Crime next to High Treason,
and called Petty Treason, and
hath a peculiar Punishment Ca∣pital.</P>
<P>Slaves in <HI>England</HI> are none
since Christianity prevailed. A
Slave brought into <HI>England,</HI> is
upon landing <HI>ipso facto</HI> free from
Slavery, but not from ordinary
service.</P>
<P><PB N="515" REF="267"/>
Some Lands in <HI>England</HI> are
holden in Villanage, to do
some particular Services to the
Lord of the Mannor, and such
Tenants may be called the
Lords Servants.</P>
<P>There is a Twofold Tenure
called Villanage, one where
the Tenure only is servile, as to
plow the Lords ground, sow,
reap, and bring home his Corn,
dung his Land, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the other
whereby both Person and Te∣nure
is servile, and bound in all
respects at the disposition of the
Lord; such persons are called
in Law pure Villans, and are
to do all Villanous Services to
improve the Land he holds to
the Lords use, themselves to
be wholly at the Lords Service,
and whatever they get is for
their Lord; of such there are
<PB N="516" REF="268"/>
now but few left in <HI>England.</HI>
The nearest to this condition
are Apprentices (that signifies
<HI>Learuers</HI>) a sort of Servants
that carry the Marks of pure
Villans or Bond-slaves (as be∣fore
in the Chapter of Gentry
is intimated) differing however
in this, that Apprentices are
Slaves only for a time and by
Covenant; the other are so at
the Will of their Masters.</P>
