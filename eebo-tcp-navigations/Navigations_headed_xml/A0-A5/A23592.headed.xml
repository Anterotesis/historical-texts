it was very necessary to withstande the

good men. Therof a man is cal¦led
a gentylman / or a noble man as be¦fore
other in vertues notable. ¶Wherof
Ierom sayth. I see no thynge elles in
noblesse / or in gentylmen but that they
are bounden in a certeyn necessyte that

of the people. For no man worshype

thenne / but as his naturall reason gaf.
And they knewe not ryghtwysly what
they sholde worshyp / all though they ly¦ued
peasyble amonge themself. For they
were so dull of wytte / y<SUP>•</SUP> they co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de pon∣dre
no grete thynge / but that was publys¦shed
by y<SUP>•</SUP> comyn peple. Wherfore it was
expedyent for ther peas to be kepte / that
they sholde haue prynces of noble byrth
¶The thyrde cause procedeth of some

y<SUP>•</SUP> who some euer wolde deffende &amp; kepe

for euer more. And in this maner of
wyse many are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adde to be noble men.
¶The fourth cause of noblynesse / was
greate habundaūce of goodes. Somty∣me
the people were holden with grete pe¦nury
of mete &amp; drynke. And then they to¦ke
them &amp; theyrs to some ryche man / y<SUP>•</SUP>

be foūde certen noble men by the prouy∣syon
