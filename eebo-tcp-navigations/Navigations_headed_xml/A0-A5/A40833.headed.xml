<HEAD>Chap. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Albertus</HI> King of <HI>Arragon,</HI> falling into a lan∣guishing Disease, was advised by his Phisitians to provide for Death; and the News being spread over the Country, many Magicians came to him, who told him, that if he could recover the <HI>Golden Eagle</HI> from the Queen of <HI>Ivyland,</HI> he should questionless recover his Health, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ALbertus</HI> having of late buried the Soul of his Life <HI>Ly∣simena,</HI> his most indulgent Queen, fell into extream Melancholy, which as it is commonly the Parent of all Diseases, so it brought him into a most tedious and lan∣guishing Sickness, which caused him to make Moan both Day and Night; witness the bitter Groans, and passionate Ex∣pressions for the loss of his departed Consort: at last, being importuned by several of his Nobles, and hourly intreated by his three Sons, <HI>Philonzo, Cruentius</HI> and <HI>Innocentine,</HI> he con∣sented to send for the chiefest Doctros in those Parts, to con∣sult about the State and Welfare of his Body; which Doctors being arrived, were presently conducted to the King's Cham∣ber, at whose sight the King broke out into these sad Ex∣pressions:</P>
<P><HI>Ye are come to look upon a delining King; ye may endeavour to use your Skills, but I am confident your Labour will be lost. Alas, my Disease is too inward to be found out; and if ye Cure me, it must be more by Miracle than Skill: If ye can Cure an al∣most broken Heart, or repair my half-decayed Lungs, or restore my near-wasted Breath, then draw near: But, alas, my</HI> Lysime∣na— And there his Sighs denying him liberty of Speech, he made Signs to be no more troubled, and turning from the Company, and almost from his own Senses, he groaned him∣self into a deep Melancholy.</P>
<P>The Doctors as yet being not thoroughly acquainted with his Disease, verily supposed him departing but it proved otherwise; for his Sons, and the rest of the Nobility inform∣ing
<PB REF="3"/>the Doctors of his Grief, desired them to use their best Endenvours for his Recovery; which accordingly they did, but finding little hopes of Life, in respect that the Distemper of his Mind bad so much impaired the Temper of his body, they only prescribed him Cordials, which indeed something revived and exhilerated his Spirits, but could not give the least hopes of Life, in respect that Nature was much extenuated and weakened by his extraordinary Melancholy.</P>
<P>The King, whether less insensible of his Disease, or some∣what more enlivened by the Prescriptions of the Doctors, de∣sires two of the ablest of them to be brought unto him, of whem he demanded their free and absolute Opinions; The Doctors after a short Pause, who having more respect to Conscience than Gain, told him that they might prolong, but not Cure; and being about to proceed into further Dis∣course, there suddenly came in some of the Nobility, and whispered with one of the Doctors, which the King percei∣ving, demanded the Cause; to which the Nobility replyed, That there were newly arrived several Magicians, who hear∣ing of his Majesty's Distemper, came out of affectionate Duty to imploy their Skill for his Recovery; the King hearing this, dismist the Doctors, and admitted the Magicians, who be∣ing entred, and after the Performance of their several Duties, applyed themselves in this manner:</P>
<P><HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Renowned Sir, We the most humble of all your Servants, being by Report informed of your Majesty's heavy and grievous Disease, have by our Industry found out a Means (which though a may seem impossible to your Majesty) will without question re∣store you to your former Health; which means (craving the Fa∣vour of your Majesty's Patience) we shall forthwith discover: Know then, most excellent Prince, that under the Jurisdiction of</HI> Agrippina, <HI>that most famous and invincible Queen of</HI> Ivy∣land, <HI>there is a</HI> Golden Eagle, <HI>in whom there is a secret and in∣fallible Remedy for your Disease; therefore if any of those He∣roick Spirits which are belonging to your Majesty, will endeavour to procure this</HI> Eagle, <HI>your Majesty's Life will questionless be pre∣served: We shall not therefore trouble your Majesty's Ears with
<PB REF="3"/>any further Relation, but leave your Majesty to the Prosecution of what we have related; only we will be bold to desire your Majesty not to be doubtful, for he that your Majesty shall least respect or expect, shall perform this dangerous and almost impossible De∣sign; so we leave your Majesty to your most serious Conside∣rations.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Chap. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Magicians being gone, the King sends for his three Sons, and acquaints them with what the Magicians had told him, proffering to divide his Estate between them, if they could recover the <HI>Eagle</HI> from the Queen of <HI>Ivyland,</HI> wishing them to take what Treasure they would for their Occasions.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Magicians being departed, the King immediately gave Command that his three Sons should come unto him; they as diligent to obey, as he was willing to command, forthwith presented themselves before him. The King after some Discourse, told them now his Days were near finished, and Nature began so much to decline in him, that he was past the Skill of Doctors; therefore let me advise you, as a dying Father, that as ye were born Brothers in Nature, so to con∣tinue in Affection. <HI>Sir,</HI> replyed the Eldest, <HI>if it please the Gods to dispose of you to Death, we must labour for that Portion of Content which may be proportionable to our Sorrows; for the Decrees of Fate are not to be resisted; and one Reason tells us, that what we cannot remedy, we must patiently endure: But for my part (and I dare say as much for my Brothers) I would willingly hazard my Life for the Prolongation of yours. Sir, I hope that you will please to apprehend that the Possessions which are like to fall to us after your Death, do not any way incite us either to hope, or wish for it.</HI> With that, the two other Brothers not able to contain any longer; desired their Father to imploy them in any thing whereby they might express their Obedience to him. To which the King (joyful to see their passionate Obedience) replyed, That there was but one way to save his Life, which was to do according to the Directions of the Magicians, who informed him, that if he could by any means recover the <HI>Gol∣den
<PB REF="4"/>Eagle</HI> from the Queen of <HI>Ivyland,</HI> that then he should be re∣stored to his former Health; But, says he, I find it a thing im∣possible, therefore I shall not trouble myself with the Thoughts of obtaining it, for the Queen is of that Power and Strength, that if I should preswade any to attempt it, I should be guilty of their Deaths, and so depart this World with a burthen'd Conscience; But, my Sons, I am very well content to leave those Slaveries which are Attendants to a Crown; I can only pray for you, and that's my uttermost.</P>
<P>Before the King had made an end of his intended Discourse, his Sons interrupted him with Sighs, that floated in Tears, and as well as their Sorrows would permit, they in most hum∣ble manner desired the King to grant them a Boon before his Departure; to which the King pleasingly replyed, Enjoy your Desires, provided ye ask what is necessary for me to give; Speak, what is your Boon? to which they replyed, <HI>Renowned Sir, It was not long since you were pleased to bless our Ears with the Discourse of the Magicians, who have assured both you and us, that if the</HI> Golden Eagle <HI>can be recovered, your Health shall be renewed; Then know, Sir, that as our Bodies are Derivatives from you, so they are by all Laws, whatsoever, to be at your Dispo∣sing; and here we present ourselves before you, and protest with all our Souls to hazard, nay lose our Lives, but we will obtain the</HI> Eagle; <HI>for you know, Sir, that Resolution backt with obedient Affections, knows no Impossibilities; Sir, we shall not arise from our Knees till you have granted our Request, and at your Royal Consent, we will forthwith fly into Action.</HI></P>
<P>The King seeing them thus resolved, thought it superfluous to endeavour to discourse them out of their Resolutions, but told them, that since their Obedience made them so ready to undertake so great a Hazard, his Affections should prompt him, at their Return, to divide all his Treasure (which at that time was very great) amongst them; in the mean time he advised them to provide themselves with what Money they would, and all other Aceutrements necessary for their Adven∣ture, which they accordingly did.</P>

<HEAD>Chap. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>How the King's three Sons provided for their Journy, and took leave of their Father and departed, and what happen∣ed between them in their Journy.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe three Brothers having prepared themselves for their Journey, came in humble manner to take leave of the King, whom they found, as formerly, very much troubled with Melancholy; but the Eldest addressing himself unto him, began in this manner:</P>
<P>Royal Sir, We your most obedient Sons, in order to our dear Affections, more than your Royal Command, present our selves to crave your Blessing upon us, and our Designs, before our Departure, not despairing of our Desires, we hum∣bly crave.— The King looking upon them with a Coun∣tenance that imported unexpressible Grief for their Departure, raised himself upon his Pillow, and with a stretched out Arm gave them his Blessing, withal advising them as they were Brothers in Nature, so to continue Brothers in Affection, and to have a care that neither Envy nor Ambition, or ambtious En∣vy, should raise a factious Difference amongst them, but as they departed Brothers, and so consequently Friends, so they should adventure and return in the like Amity they departed; And so the greatest Blessing that a dying Father can bestow upon his Departing Children, accompany you; but before you go, let m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as a Father, advise you of two things; The one is, the Pleasure of the Gods by the neglect of your. Duty to them; the other is, The Danger of evil Company, which may seduce you to many Inconveniences; and so farewel▪ what I want in Words, I shall supply in Thoughts.</P>
<P>Thus these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Brothers having received the Sum of their Desires, depa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> from the Presence of their Father, and so ta∣king leave of their Friends at Court, departed: At last, ha∣ving journied three Days, they came by a mistake of thou Way into a great Wood, where being in a Wilderness of Doubt, they consulted what was best to do; <HI>Philonzo,</HI> the elder Bro∣ther, beginning already to find the Incumbrances of Travel. exprest himself to the others, as follows:</P>
<PB REF="5"/>
<P>We see, dear Brothers, the many Troubles the want of Consideration brings upon us; we have (as I have weighed in my more serious Thoughts) undertaken a most dangerous, troublesome, and almost impossible Design; To prevent this, how shall we advise? If we should return home, we should turn our noble Undertakings to Ignominy and Shame; and if we proceed, without question we shall lose our Lives; and what will the World say but this, They have the Effect of their Rashness; for the more dangerous a Design is, the more it ought to be discust; but they that like <HI>Phaeton,</HI> mount at Impossibilities, shall at last fall like him with Shame and Dis∣honour; therefore, Brothers, let me hear your Advice. To which <HI>Cruentius,</HI> the second Brother, replied,</P>
<P>'Tis true, rash Beginnings have most commonly fatal Con∣clusions: For my part, as yet I never weighed the Business, nor the Danger, but altogether depended upon your Judg∣ment as an Oracle, not dreaming but you had known the Difficulty of the Business: But stay now, I better consider the Matter, methinks it should not be so difficult, for sure we three can conquer one <HI>Eagle;</HI> for, Brother, you shall catch her, and I will warrant you my Brother and I will hold her; but where shall we find her? Fie, Brother, quoth <HI>Philonzo,</HI> I see you as much err in the Matter, as I did in the Manner of the Business. This <HI>Eagle</HI> is a Bird kept for her Soveraignty in a great City walled round with Brass, pallizado'd with Iron, guarded with Lyons and Dragons, and commanded by Gy∣ants, and we must, before we come to this City, encounter with several Knights, which attend purposely for such At∣tempters as we must be: Many have attempted, but never any as yet returned to tell the manner of their Attempts; there∣fore, Brother, the Business is of more Intricacy than you ima∣gine. O monstrous, cry'd <HI>Cruentius,</HI> I am more than half dead already with the Relation, tall no more of it: What, Dragons and Bears, Lyons and Giants, Brazen Walls and I∣ron Pallizadoes? Oh how am I thundred to Death! Attempt it, who will, for my part I'll starve here rather han be eaten with Bears, and Lyons, and Dragons, and — Oh horrible
<PB REF="5"/>Giants, not I. Brother <HI>Innocentine,</HI> What sayest thou to these terrible things? what, art not afraid? Well I have Fear enough for you both, but, good Brother, speak. To which <HI>Innocentine</HI> the younger undauntedly replied:</P>
<P>As I am youngest in Years, so I am last in Speech, and I could wish I might be the least; but in respect I am to make answer to both your Demands, I must a little exercise your Patience: 'Tis true, the Danger is great, therefore the more noble; but had you, my Brethren, according to my Father's Advice, importuned the Gods before you had undertaken this great Design, questionless the one had not been filled with Doubts, nor the other with Fears, nor I with Shame for you both; you seem to be as much displeased at my Words, as I am at your Actions; shall we begin to tire, be∣fore we begin to do? For Shame, let not the World have this Advantage of our Reputations: If we return home, we must expect to undergo a Disgrace worse than Death; If we dye, we dye in high Attempts; who knows but the Gods may shew extraordinary Favours, and smile at our Designs, being we do it for our dear Father's Life? If the worst come to the worst, we can but dye, and we had better do so than live as if we lived not: but I perceive my Discourse of∣fends, I will therefore be silent.</P>

<HEAD>Chap. IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Philonzo</HI> and <HI>Cruentius</HI> hearing the Discourse of their younger' Brother <HI>Innocentine,</HI> robb'd him of his Trea∣sure, and left him bound in a Wood, where they afterwards lost themselves.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>CRuentius</HI> hearing his Brother's Discourse, which was con∣trary to his Expectations, told him that he was a very rash Boy, and understood not what he spoke; For, says he, shall we cast away our Lives, because the World should say we died nobly? Brother, says he to <HI>Philonzo,</HI> are we bound to be Fools because he's mad? No, let's leave him to the Thoughts of Honour, whilst you and I consult what's best to do; so walking a distance from him, they sate down, and
<PB REF="6"/>began thus to express themselves: Brother <HI>Cruentius,</HI> I have both in this short time considered the Shame and the Danger, let us endeavour to haste to <HI>Mesemptronia,</HI> a City which I am sure cannot be far from this Place, where we may refresh ourselves, and have further Discourse. But what shall we do, replied <HI>Cruentius,</HI> with you foolish Boy? you perceive how refractory and inconsiderate he is, and makes slight of that Danger which we know to be very great: If we leave him, questionless he will return home and incense the King against us; what we shall do in this I know not, but leave it to your Discretion. Let's force him with us, quoth <HI>Philonzo,</HI> and make him do according to our Wills; if not, we will threat∣en to kill him. No, quoth <HI>Cruentius,</HI> that cannot be, for then he will pry into all our Actions, and make a Discovery at our Returns; but, Brother, quoth he, our Business requires haste, let us therefore take away his Treasure, and bind him, and leave him in the Wood; for it's better one perish than two: and if the worst comes to the worst, that he should be unloosed and return home, we know at our return how to perswade that what he has related is only Lies to disgrace us, and by that means to insinnuate the more into Favour himself, and injure us. I like this Advice well, quoth <HI>Philonzo;</HI> let us quickly put it in Execution, for the Night hastens; with that returning to <HI>Innocentine,</HI> they asked him, what he in∣tended to do; who replied, What they did not. And so you shall, quoth <HI>Cruentius;</HI> and so both running together laid hold on him, and without hearing him speak, bound him, and took away his Treasure, and turning his Horse loose to range in the Woods they departed. Thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y poor <HI>Innocen∣tine</HI> miserably bound, insomuch, that the swelling of his Hands and Feet made him most sadly lament his grievous Tortures: But <HI>Philonzo</HI> and <HI>Cruentius</HI> having rambled up and down the Wood for the space of two Hours, could by no means find the Way out, insomuch that they despair'd of tra∣velling any further that Night, but having not rode a Flight∣shot further, it happened that a Dog having lost his Master, came fawning on <HI>Cruentius,</HI> who presently laid hold of him,
<PB REF="6"/>and tying him in a String, followed the Dog, who forthwith brought them out of the Wood, and presently after to a Shep∣herd's House where the Dog received present Entertain∣ment; but <HI>Philonzo</HI> and <HI>Cruentius</HI> none, where we shall for a time leave them, and return to <HI>Innocentine,</HI> whom they left bound in the Wood.</P>

<HEAD>Chap. V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Innocentine</HI> was unbound by an Hermet, and how afterwards he saved a beautiful Lady from Ravishment, and how the Lady requited him.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>INnocentine</HI> being fast bound by his unnatural Brothers, lay till the Approach of the Evening in a most miserable Con∣dition, till at last a Hermet coming from his Cell, to take the Cool of the Evening, heard the Groans of poor <HI>Innocentine,</HI> and being moved with Pity, he addressed himself to the place (I may well say) of Groans, where being come, his Eyes saw, what his Heart pitied, his Heart pitied what his Hand re∣lieved; for he forthwith conducted him to his Cell, and made such Preparations for him as his. Necessity required, so that the next Morning he was in a Condition to travel; but the Hermit viewing his Guest, read in his Countenance the Cha∣racters of a noble and ingenious Disposition, observing by his Deportment, that he was not a Man of ordinary Education, besides being led by his own Inclinations, he accosts his Sra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ger in this manner:</P>
<P>Sir, I perceive that Youth and Education prompts you to Bashfulness, and your Bashfulness hinders the Liberty of your Speech, I therefore heartily intreat you to inform me of your present Condition, and what I want in Power, I will supply in Prayer for you; I will not stand to trouble you to relate the Misfortunes, it is enough, and too much that I saw them, only tell me which Way you intend to steer, and what you want.</P>
<P><HI>Innocentine</HI> all this while amazed at the Courtesie of the Hermit, knew not presently what to answer, but as well as
<PB REF="7"/>his late Distemper, attended with a multitude of Thoughts, would permit, he thus replied:</P>
<P>Most charitable Father, I could grieve that I was sorry for my last Misfortune, in respect that the Happiness of your Acquaintance is derived from it, I'll not trouble your Patience with the discouse of my Misfortune; only in short, I am go∣ing upon a Design to save the Life of a renowned King, but this Misfortune hath put me out of a Capacity to follow my Intentions. Come, says the Hermit, I know your Disease, I'll be your Physician, take this Cordial, giving him a bag of Gold and Jewels, and return no complimental Answer, for I am bound to do it; and if you want a Steed, I have one for you which this very Day stragled hither, pray take him and use him as your own; but for this Sword, which I intend for your use, pray return it if you live, if not, conceal the Vir∣tue, for it will preserve you against all Enchantments, which are now very common to my woful Experience, neither need you fear, whom you encounter with it, for you shall not want success.</P>
<P><HI>Innocentine</HI> not a little rejoyced at what the Hermit had told him, desired liberty to depart, in order to which the Hermit conducted him to his Horse; but it fell out that the Horse was his own, which he thought his Brothers had car∣ried away with them; the Hermit observing him look so strictly upon the Horse, told him that he could not promise him the like Service from the Horse, as he did from the Sword; No, Sir, quoth <HI>Innocentine,</HI> I believe I am better acquainted with the Horse than you, for Yesterday he was mine, till taken from me by Misfortune: but however, I can∣not but express my hearty Thanks to you, and at my return you shall know more of me; in the mean time, let Peace a∣bide with you; let me only beg your Directions to <HI>Green Ivy∣land,</HI> for I am altogether a Stranger in these Parts. Your ready way, quoth the Hermit, is to go to <HI>Mesemptronia,</HI> a City about three Leagues from hence, the way is direct through several Villages, where you may at your pleasure en∣quire;
<PB REF="7"/>but there is a Forrest which lies between a little Town called <HI>Corumbus</HI> and <HI>Mesemptronia,</HI> where you must have a careful Eye, least you be set upon before you can pro∣vide for Resistance; this is all that I can advise you, and so farewel.</P>
<P>Thus they departed, and after the expence of some Hours, <HI>Innocentine</HI> came to the Forrest which the Hermit told him of, where he was no sooner entred, hut he was welcomed with many loud and lamentable Shrieks, which struck him into Admiration; but being of an undaunted Spirit, and re∣membring the sad Estate he himself was in the Day before, resolved to find out the place where he heard this lamentable Noise; and being more directed by the Ear than the Eye; he at length effected his Desires, for imemdiately in a Valley he espied two Villians about to ravish a Lady of an incompa∣rable Beauty, and being passionately exasperated, he flew up∣on them like Lightning, but giving them leave to mount themselves, they instead of fight presently run away, percei∣ving it was their Brother: <HI>Innocentine</HI> perceiving their Flight, clapt Spurs and followed them, but the Lady perceiving it, and fearful that two to one might be very disadvantagious, cryed out with what strength she had, Help, help, which <HI>Innocentine</HI> hearing, fearing some other Accident had befallen the Lady, speedily returned, but when he came, he found no such matter, but the Lady being heartily glad of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> return, applied her self to him in this manner:</P>
<P>Most noble and renowned Knight, my late Fright hath so disordered my thoughts, that for the present I cannot return you those Thanks which are due to your Merits; but if you please to add one Favour more to the rest, which is to conduct me to my poor Habitation (from which place those Villi∣ans you saw, having surprized me in a solitary Walk, dragg'd me) you will very much increase my Happiness. To which Request <HI>Innocentine</HI> condescended, and in short time came to the Place where he found a welcome Entertainment: So after many Ceremonies past between them, the Lady re∣quested
<PB REF="8"/>to know what his Name and Birth was; to which <HI>Innocentine</HI> replied, So much confidence have I of your Worth, that I will not keep the least of my thoughts from you; so composing himself, he told her his Name, Birth and Design, and likewise told her how his Brothers had dealt with him, which he was confident were those whieh would have ravished her, had not he by Providence prevented them; the Lady hearing his Relation, was much astonished, but at last recalling herself from her Admiration, proceeded as follows:</P>
<P>Most magnanimous and ingenious Knight, I cannot but ac∣knowledge my Life and Honour to be protected by your Virtue; I shall therefore in part of a Requital communicate something to you for your Advantage, which in short is this: Not far from this place there is an enchanted Castle kept by two Ladies, at which Castle, (if you please to go) you
<FIGURE>

</FIGURE> shall find civil Entertainment from the Ladies; one of them will much press you to Marriage, but by no means con∣sent, but promise at your return to give Satisfaction to her
<PB REF="8"/>Request; tell them that likewise you have a short Journey to take but the Horse dying in the Journey, you are now quite de∣stitute; then they will presently carry you into a spacious Stable, where they will shew you many Steeds, and bid you take your Choice; but refuse them all, but one, which seems to be the meanest, and they will be very unwilling to lend you him: you shall know him by this Sign, as soon as you come into the Stable you shall find him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid, and all the rest standing, I will not now any longer detain you, leave your Horse with me till your return, and you shall accomplish your Business. Thus <HI>Inocentine</HI> and the Lady parted, but we will now leave him and return to the other Brothers, which are by this time come to <HI>Mesemptronia.</HI></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Philonzo</HI> and <HI>Cruentius</HI> came to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Shepherd's House, but could not be entertained; and how they lay under an Oak that Night, and the next Morning took their Journey for <HI>Mesemptronia.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>PHilonzo</HI> and <HI>Cruentius</HI> being come to the Shepherd's House immediately alighted and knockt at the Door, but the old Shepherd and his Wife being newly gone to Bed, were very unwilling to rise; at last the Shepherd hearing them grow more violent in their Knocks, arose, and looked out of (I cannot say the Window) but out of a Hole or Cranny, and asked. Who was there; to which <HI>Philonzo</HI> replied, A couple of Passengers which had lost their Way in the Wood, and by a Dog which we followed brought hither. The Shep∣herd's Wife which but a little before was awaked out of her Sleep with sighing for the Loss of her Dog, starts out of her Bed and cries, Oh, her dear <HI>Cut,</HI> and so runs down and lets in her Dog, and after many Expressions of insufferable Joy, having entertain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> her Dog with many a sweet Kiss, she went to Bed and slept very heartily, whilst <HI>Philonzo</HI> and <HI>Cruentius</HI> begg'd very earnestly for Entertainment to protect them from a Storm, which they perceived was hastening upon them;
<PB REF="9"/>but all their Intreaties were in vain; for the Shepherd told them, That he and his Wife were abused not long since by a Couple that desired to be entertained as they did, and there∣fore he would not admit them by any means: At last, when they saw their Intreaties were in vain, they departed, trusting themselves to the Protection of an Oak, where they had not long reposed, but a great Tempest of Thunder and Lightning disturbed them of their Rest, so that they forsook the place, as deeming it dangerous to lye there in such tempestuous Wea∣ther; so wandring up and down all Nigt, without any Rest, in the Morning they prepared for their Journey, and being at last refreshed with the Heat of the Sun, they spurred chearful∣ly along till they came within View of a (not stately but) well scituated House, not far from which, they espied a beau∣tiful Lady walking so solitary, that she hardly took notice of her own Thoughts: <HI>Philonzo</HI> riding towards her, and sur∣prizing her on a sudden, put her into such an Amasement; that for the present she knew neithre what to do or say; but <HI>Phi</HI>-well skill'd in the Rudiments of malicious Impudence, begins to accost her in this manner:</P>
<P>Madam, quoth he, I very much commend your Choice, you have chosen a pleasant Morning, and a sweet Air for your private Meditations. Sir, replied the Lady, the Walk and the Air would be more pleasant if you were further from it; I wonder a Knight, as you seem to be, should be so unadvised, or rather uncivil, to intrude without Notice or Acquaintance; Sir, if you are noble, shew it by your Eorbearance. to which replied <HI>Philonzo,</HI></P>
<P>Madam, had you been less Beautiful, I had been less Am∣bitious; but, Madam, your Beauty is the Author of my bold Intrusion, but I hope you have Goodness to pardon, as well as I have Infirmities to offend. Sir, quoth the Lady, the Vanity of Courtship hath taught me to dislike a Courtier, I will therefore leave my Walk to your Enjoyment. Nay, quoth <HI>Philonzo,</HI> I cannot so suddenly dismiss you, for your Beau∣ty
<PB REF="9"/>has made such a Conquest of my Heart, so either return what your Beauty has robb'd me of, or I must be inforced to take it. Sir, quoth the Lady, I neither know your Intent, not Meaning, but I expect you to be civil, therefore wrong not my Expectations. At which Words, <HI>Philonzo</HI> beckoning to his Brother <HI>Cruentine</HI> that stood within sight, presently with much Rigour and Incivility laid hold on her, and dragg'd her into a Forrest which was within half a Mile, being assisted by his Brother <HI>Cruentine.</HI> I need not tell the Reader of the many Tears, the grievous Complaints, the sundry Prayers this poor distessed Lady made to those inhumane Villains, but all to no purpose: For had not an unexpected Knight passed by, who hearing the Shrieks of one in Distress, boldly approached to place, where he found these Villains endeavouring to rob her of her Chastity, whom they 'spying, perceived him to be their Brother, which they left bound in the Wood, ran a∣way, and at last arrived at <HI>Mesemptronia,</HI> where being come, they presently went to to their Inn, and so to Rest, not at the least troubled at their barbarous Cruelty; the next Morning approaching, they arose, and commanded a plentiful Dinner to be provided, and that such Company as the City afforded should be invited to keep them Company, being Strangers at that Time; to which their Host, preferring his own Gain, condescended, and fore with sent for a Crew of the most no∣torious Cheats the Town could afford, who plausibly treated the new come Guests, telling them of the many Courtisans the City abounded withal, which were presently sent for, and a great Banquet provided, to the Admiration of the diligent∣ly joyful Host; but after some Days of their abode they began to feel a Consumption in their Pockets, which caused them to consult of their Departure.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Innocentine</HI> had his Desire in the inchanted Castle, with a Promise to return; how he recovered the <HI>Gold∣en Eagle</HI> from the Queen of <HI>Green Iveyland,</HI> and how his Horse was turned into a Man, who afterwards directed him what to do.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFter <HI>Innocentine</HI> perceiv'd which Steed it was which the Lady advised him to request, he was very importunate with the Ladies to let him have that Horse which was laid; to which they replied, Alas, that was the worst in the Stable, desiring him to make some other Choice; but he replied, That the other were too good and too lusty for him, in respect that he was a very bad Horseman. The Ladies seeing that
<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>woodcut of man riding horse</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE> he would not be denied, endeavoured to enchant him, but their Enchantments could not take Effect, because the Hermit's Sword, was a Preservative. Thus seeing all their Labour in vain, they made him swear that he would return again, and he should have his Desires; but to be short, having swore according to their Desires, the Horse was brought forth, he
<PB REF="10"/>leaping upon him, was on a sudden carried to <HI>Green Iveyland,</HI> and in his Journey overthrew many Knights which waited there to encounter any that should approach: But he with his good Sword and Steed made slight of 'em; then he approach∣ed to the Brazen Walls, where he was welcomed with the Roaring of Lions and Dragons, but as he brandished his Sword they fell into a dead Sleep, then <HI>Innocentine</HI> passed freely: not long after he came to a Fort which was guarded by Giants, who when they perceived his Approach, pre∣sently came running at him with great Violence, but he no sooner brandish'd his sword but they fell all asleep. At length, having many more Difficulties, which are now too tedious to relate, he came to the Place where the Queen and the Ea∣gle was: The Queen and her Attendance beholding a Stran∣ger so near her Presence, began to rebuke his Insolency; but he brandishing his Sword, the Queen and all her Attendance fell asleep, insomuch that they could not be waked; in the mean time <HI>Innocentine</HI> alighted and took the Eagle, with no small joy, and was departing, but his Horse would not by any means stir a Foot from the Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce, which made <HI>Innocen∣tine</HI> in a doubt what to do; but beholding the incomparable Beauty of the Queen, he drew near and saluted her as she slept, after which, <HI>Innocentine</HI> cut off a Lock of the Queen's Hair, and left a Lock of his in her Bosom, and then he took a Ring of rich Value from her Finger, and put one of his in the same place; then finding her Picture about her Neck, he took that off, and supplied the Place with his own. Having done these things, he writes these Lines, and pins them upon the Sleeve of her Garment:
<Q><L>Renowned Queen, what here is done,</L>
<L>Was acted by a Monarch's Son:</L>
<L>But before I could depart,</L>
<L>I took your Eagle, left my Heart:</L>
<L>Accept the Change, and pardon the Abuse;</L>
<L>Virtue whilst you remain, will be in use.</L></Q>
<PB REF="11"/>Having thus done, he mounts his Horse with the Eagle in his Hand, and was immediately brought to the Forrest where he preserved the Lady from Ravishment: His Steed making a Stand at a great River, would not go any further, notwith∣standing <HI>Innocentine</HI> used all the Skill he could with Switch and Spur, but at last his Horse spake, and bid him forbear, and alight; <HI>Innocentine</HI> not a little amazed, alighted, then the Horse began to tell him, he must chop off his Head, and throw it into that River, withal bidding him not to be afraid for he intended him no Harm; But, says he, when you have throw me in, stand with your Sword by the River, and in what Shape soever you see me appear, knock me down again, till I a∣rise in the Shape of a Man; <HI>Innocentine</HI> being something ama∣zed at this sudden and strange Alteration, knew not for the present what to do, but after a little pause, he resolved to do it, which being done, he threw the Head into the River, and it rose up the first time like a Lyon, but he presently knockt it down, then it rose up in several other Shapes, but he still kept it down, but at last it arose like a tall proper Man, and then he helpt it out, which being done; the Man bid him fear nothing but follow his Advice, and give Ear to him, whilst he informed him of something which might conduce to his Be∣nefit: I was, saith he, a Knight in that enchanted Castle which you had me out of, and all those fair Steeds you saw, were inchanted Knights; I am likewise the Husband of that Lady you preserved from the Violence of your Brothers, which Brothers will meet with you before you come home, with full Resolution to kill you; but fear not, but hide the Ring and Picture, which you had of the Queen, and desire them not to kill you, but tell them you will never discover them to your Father, then they shall take away your Eagle and let you go; Thus as you have preserved me and mine, I will preserve you and yours.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Philonzo</HI> and <HI>Cruentius</HI> obtained a counter∣feit Eagle in the City of <HI>Mesemptronia,</HI> and returning home met their younger Brother <HI>Innocentine,</HI> and robb'd him of his Eagle, and what after happened.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>PHilonzo</HI> and <HI>Cruentius</HI> having spent most of their Money, at last agreed with some in the City to get them an Ea∣gle; which they pretended they could do, which was not long effecting, for they got a very great Fowl, the nearest they could like an Eagle, and guilded his Feathers, and brought it to them, which they with much Joy accepted, gi∣ving a large Sum for it, and forthwith departed the City; but as they travelled, it was their Fortune to meet their Bro∣ther <HI>Innocentine</HI> carrying an Eagle in a silver Cage, at the sight whereof their Eagle trembled and dyed; but without the least Salute to their Brother, they run upon him, and would have killed him; but he, according to his Advice had hid the Ring and Picture in a private place about him, which they discover'd not, but took away Cage and Eagle, with full intent to kill him; but he with many passionate Expressions diverted their Intentions, promising them to become their Servant, and never betray them to his Father: they hearing these Promises, saved his Life, and so he became their Servant, and they journeyed together; at last coming home, and carrying their Eagle in Triumph, they were ioyfully enter∣tained; the King embracing the two Eldest, and command∣ing the Youngest to be immediately put to Death for those Lyes which his Brothers had related of him; but <HI>Innocentine</HI> heartily begg'd of his Father that he might not be put to Death, and so did his Brothers seemingly, but that he might be made Inferior to the worst Servant in the House, to which the King, though, unwilling, agreed: Thus was poor <HI>Innocentine,</HI> that deserved a just Reward, cast out of his Father's Favour for ever. But it happened that not long after the Queen of <HI>Green Ivy-land,</HI> hearing where her Eagle
<PB REF="12"/>was, came with a great Train to <HI>Arragon,</HI> and presented herself to the King, who was absolutely cured by the Vertue of the Eagle. The Queen receiving that bountiful Enter∣tainment which her Estate required, asked the King how ma∣ny Sons he had; to which the King replied, Two; she desi∣red she might be allowed so great a Favour as to see them; immediately they appeared; so she called <HI>Philonzo,</HI> and asked him if he was the Man that made so gallant an At∣tempt for her Eagle; he replied, It was his poor Endeavour that obtained it. Pray, says she, let me see some Assurance; did you leave me nothing, nor take nothing from me? No, replied <HI>Philonzo.</HI> Then, quoth the Queen, you are not the Man; after him was presented <HI>Cruentius,</HI> whom the Queen in like manner greeted, but he replied as <HI>Philonzo</HI> did, That he took nothing from her, nor left any thing with her. The Queen concealing her Anger, told the King that these Myste∣ries past her Imaginations; desired the King ingeniously to tell her if he had no more Sons. Renowned Queen, I must confess I had another Son, which now I own not; I think he may be living amongst the mean Servants of my House, but for a Son I own him not. To which the Queen replied, she must needs see him; Alas, replied the King, I think him not worthy of my Presence, much more of so renowned a Queen as yourself: but to satisfie your Requests, he shall be called; in the mean time the King departed, whilst <HI>Innocentine</HI> ap∣proached the Queen's Presence, to whom the Queen discours'd as follows:</P>
<P>Are you the youngest Son of this Royal King, or no? he replied, with a blushing Countenance, No. What, are you his Servant? he replied, No. Friend, you speak very my∣sterously, discover thy self. Then know, incomparable La∣dy, that my Father being incens'd against me, condemn'd me to dye; but by the Request of my Brothers I was preserved, and became a Servant to the worst of my Father's Servants, contenting my self with these poor Habiliments, which indeed were they as rich as could be imagined, were too mean to be
<PB REF="12"/>presented before so worthy a Person, as, Madam, you are; and for myself, I could tremble into Ashes at the sight of so excellent a Creature as your vertuous self; but I shall remove so unworthy an Object from your Sight, and crave License to depart. No, replyed the Queen, you shall not; I have a few questions to ask you. My Rudeness, most unparrall'd La∣dy, shall be as obedient to reply, as your Grace shall be ready to demand, although I am unworthy to be the least of your Creatures. The Queen hearing him express himself with so much Humility, and Excellency of Speech, the King for∣getting his Son was there, came suddenly into the Presence of Queen, and beholding his Out-cast, started back; the Queen perceiving it, desir'd the King to yield her so great a Favour as to stay to hear her ask his Son two or three Questions; the King not using to deny the Request of such Persons, sate down, whilst the Queen thus exprest herself to <HI>Innocentine:</HI> Was it you that took my Eagle from me, pray answer me without Ceremony? To which he bowing himself, replyed, Madam, I did. And what Token left you with me, or took from me? Madam, a Lock of your Hair. Where is it? re∣plied the Queen. Next my Heart, Madam, replied <HI>Inno∣centine,</HI> and here it is. But what did you leave me? said the Queen. A Lock of mine, replied <HI>Innocentine.</HI> Great Prince, (said the Queen to the King) and here it is; but pray let your Patience expect my farther Discourse with him; Come hi∣ther, said the Queen, to bashful <HI>Innocentine,</HI> do you know this Picture and this Ring? Yes, Madam, and I hope your Greatness knows these, (shewing her the Picture and Ring which he had took from her.) Come, says the Queen, give me the Picture, and instead of the Shadow, take the Substance; I am resolved, renowned King, not to depart, till I have made him Possessor of all I have. Admire it not; for it is nothing but Truth.</P>
<P>The King, like a Man transported, at first thought the Queen to be possest of a Frenzy, but after more serious De∣bate, found all Truth which she had related, and presently
<PB REF="13"/>sent for his two Sons, <HI>Philonzo</HI> and <HI>Cruentius,</HI> and commands their Heads to be struck off; but <HI>Innocentine</HI> seconded with his incomperable Lady, perswaded his Father to save their Lives, and banish them; which the King, though unwilling∣ly, consented to, after which he imbraced his Son, and told him, in Requital of his great Abuses, he would settle his Kingdom upon him. The Queen joyful to see the King im∣brace his Son, desired the King that hereafter he would please to own her as his obedient Daughter. So <HI>Innocentine</HI> and the Queen were shortly after married, and departed into their own Country of <HI>Ivy land.</HI></P>
