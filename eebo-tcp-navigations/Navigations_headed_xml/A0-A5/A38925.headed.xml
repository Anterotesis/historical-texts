<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>IF we peruse the Histories of the Ancients, we shall find the <HI>Mediterranean Sea</HI> to have been the first most Eminent <HI>Neptunean</HI> Theater of Blood and Slaughter. And the same Stories tell us, with Asto∣nishment, (for all Excesses are wonderful to Man) of the Naval Force of all the <HI>Persian</HI> Empire, quite broken and destroyed at <HI>Artemisium</HI> by <HI>Euribeas</HI> the <HI>Lace∣demonian;</HI> and at <HI>Salamine,</HI> by <HI>Themistocles</HI> the <HI>A∣thenian</HI> Admiral. Succeeding Histories relate the Bloody Contests of the <HI>Athenians</HI> and <HI>Lacedemonians,</HI> the <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> for the Dominion of the <HI>Mediterranean.</HI> Asterwards, we hear of <HI>Augustus</HI> and <HI>Mark Anthony,</HI> covering the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> with Two powerful Fleets, contending for the Empire of al∣most all the Inhabited World, till the Engagement at <HI>Actium</HI> decided the Controversie. I might add to these, a dismal prospect of the <HI>Genoeses</HI> and <HI>Venetian</HI> Fleets for many Years together, contesting upon the same Seas for Superiority: The Two vast Fleets of <HI>Se∣lym</HI> the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Sultan, and that of the <HI>Chri∣stians</HI> under <HI>Don John</HI> of <HI>Austria,</HI> that met near the Bay of <HI>Lepanto,</HI> where the Victory, wrested from the <HI>Infidels,</HI> within the space of a few Hours, set at li∣berty no less than <HI>13000 Christian</HI> Captives. And lastly, that Invincible <HI>Armada,</HI> with which the King of
<PB REF="3"/><HI>Spain</HI> then thought not only to have conquered <HI>England,</HI> but to have freighted the spacious Island it self, and re∣mov'd it into his own Seas. But all these Numerous Fleets of Gallies, and Cock-boats, would have made but a small Figure on that Watry Stage, had the Magni∣ficent Terror of the First, Second, Third and Fourth Rates, at this present, under the Command of Admiral <HI>Russel,</HI> spread it self among 'em. Great things are therefore expected from such a prodigious Force, than which the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> never carried upon her Shoul∣ders a more Formidable, since the <HI>Phaenicians</HI> first taught the Art of Sayling. No question then, but a just and true Account of the Exploits perform'd by such a Con∣gress of Thunder and Lightning cannot choose but be acceptable to all the World. Which as we have already began to give, so we shall continue, as Occasions offer. All that we can say as yet, though this be also very great, is only that it has sav'd one of the most spacious Provinces of <HI>Spain</HI> from the compleat Conquest of an Insulting E∣nemy; and that, if any thing of Unhappiness has hitherto attended it, 'tis only that no Opposition dares meet it: While <HI>Tourville,</HI> an Admiral now without a Fleet, is so far from presuming to adventure an Engagement, that he does all he can to secure his <HI>Terribles</HI> and his <HI>Tri∣umphants</HI> with Land Fortifications; afraid to trust 'em in their proper Elements. Fear makes him avoid the sight of this Formidable Fleet, and Fear makes others court the Terror of it; witness the Submissive Language of the haughty <HI>Algerines</HI> to the Admiral that com∣mands it. This I say, is all very great; but as greater things are expected, so there is no question but we shall give the World an Account of them, the next time we appear in Print.</P>

<HEAD>A JOURNAL OF THE <HI>ENGLISH</HI> and <HI>DƲTCH</HI> FLEET, Under the Command of <HI>Admiral Russel.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ABOUT the end of <HI>April,</HI> in the Year 1694, the Right Honourable Admiral <HI>Russel,</HI> being appointed by his Majesty to command the Confederate Fleet, then design'd for the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, arrived at <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> and the next Morning after his Arrival there, went on Board the <HI>Britannia.</HI> The whole Fleet which was nu∣merously formidable, was said to be vittl'd for Four Months, which made most People conclude what was only conjectur'd
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>before, that such great Preparations were not intended for a short Expedition. For it was plainly seen by the Letter which the King of <HI>France</HI> sent to the <HI>Bey</HI> of <HI>Algier,</HI> purporting, that he had order'd a Numerous Fleet of 50 Ships of Line of Battel, 20 Bomb-Vessels, and 44 Galleys, into the <HI>Mediter∣ranean,</HI> to Bomb and Destroy all the Sea-port Towns of <HI>Spain,</HI> that would not preserve themselves from utter Ruin by large Contributions of Money, and to exact great Sums from <HI>Genoa</HI> and <HI>Legorn,</HI> That <HI>Tourville</HI> was to brave it in the <HI>Le∣vant,</HI> and shut up the Passages of the Streights in such a man∣ner, that there should be no Trading for either <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Dutch;</HI> and for the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they were to be exterminated out of the Ocean. 'Twas therefore thought convenient to di∣vide the Confederate Fleet, and send the greatest part of it un∣der Admiral <HI>Russel,</HI> in search of this same Threatning Ene∣my, in order to fight the Marshal where e're they found him, if he would stand the shock, and to keep the Seas open for free∣dom of Trade.</P>
<P>For this purpose, upon the 5th of <HI>May,</HI> he set Sail from St. <HI>Helens,</HI> with part of the Fleet, directing his Course West∣ward; the rest of the Men of War remaining behind at the <HI>Spit-head,</HI> under the Command of Sir <HI>Cloudsly Showell,</HI> Vice-Admiral of the Red Squadron.</P>
<P>As he sail'd on, the Admiral had intelligence, that there lay in <HI>Bertume</HI> Road, a considerable Fleet of <HI>French</HI> Merchant-Men, Eastward bound. Upon which he sent away Capt. <HI>Pickard</HI> in the <HI>Monmouth,</HI> together with the <HI>Resolution</HI> and <HI>Roebuck</HI> Fire-ship, either to bring them away, or to destroy them. Accordingly upon the 10th of the same Month, as soon as it was light, they made toward the <HI>French</HI> Shore, about Seven Miles from the Fleet; and by Five a Clock in the Morning, they deserv'd several Ships behind a Point of Land near <HI>Conquet</HI> Bay; which, immediately upon a Signal given from one of their Scouts, hois'd their Sails. In the mean time Capt. <HI>Pickard</HI> pursu'd the Man of War that was their Convoy, and forc'd her to hale in with the Shore, and run against the Rocks, under the Castle that stood farthest into the Sea. This Man of War, as the Prisoners afterwards de∣clar'd,
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>hapn'd to be the <HI>Jersey</HI> Frigate, which the <HI>French</HI> had taken from the <HI>English</HI> some time before, in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and which soon after was blown up, either by Acci∣dent or Voluntarily, 'tis not material whether. After this, the <HI>English</HI> Men of War stood into <HI>White Bay,</HI> as far as they could with safety, plying the <HI>French</HI> Ships that were there with their great Guns; but their Vessels being 27 in number, all ran ashore together, with as many more in and about <HI>Con∣quet.</HI> The <HI>English</HI> Frigates then stood into <HI>Bertume</HI> Bay, and took one of the Merchants Ships, though the Castle ply'd them all the while with their great Shot and Bombs. There were in this Fleet Six Sloops, carrying from Ten to Sixteen Guns, two of which, as the Prisoners confest, were burnt by the blowing up of the <HI>Jersey.</HI> There were also among them, Four Vessels of good Burthen, part of whose Lading was Guns and Mortars, the biggest of which ran ashore against the Rocks of St. <HI>Matthew</HI>'s Point. The Merchants Ships were in all about 55 Sail, of which 35 were either burnt or sunk, 25 in <HI>White-Bay,</HI> 4 on the South-side of the Point of the Bay, and 6 on the South-side of <HI>Conquet,</HI> their Lading being for the most part Salt, Wine and Brandy. The News of this Exploit so luckily perform'd, came to <HI>Whitehall</HI> by an Express dated from the Fleet, the 18th of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>By another Express dated the 19th of the same Month, an Account was given, That Capt. <HI>Townsend</HI> in the <HI>Foresight,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Cooper</HI> in the <HI>England</HI> Frigate, having Four <HI>English</HI> Pri∣vateers in their Company, upon the 17th, about Six a Clock in the Morning, to the East-ward of Cape <HI>la Hogue,</HI> got sight of another Fleet of <HI>French</HI> Merchants, bound for <HI>Diep</HI> and <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> and giving them Chase, tack'd upon Five of them, one of which happened to be a Man of War of 23 Guns, and ran them all ashore, in a Rocky Place, call'd <HI>Omonvel,</HI> where they were protected by a small Castle. Upon which they made after the rest of the Fleet, and forc'd several of them ashore near <HI>Sherburg;</HI> and while they kept off the <HI>French</HI> Con∣voy, the <HI>English</HI> Privateers took Six of them: The whole Fleet consisting of about 50 Sail, laden with Corn and Bread for the service of the <HI>French</HI> Army in <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
<P>This first motion of part of the Confederate Fleet, was on∣ly to observe the Countenances of the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Brest,</HI> and to get the best intelligence that could be had, what Strength they had left behind in the Ocean; for that the Admiral did not sail from S. <HI>Helens</HI> till the 29th of <HI>May</HI> in the Morning, at what time there being but little Wind, and that which was being against him, he was forced to come to an Anchor a∣gain; but at length upon the 30th in the Morning, the Wind choping about to the North with a fresh Gale, the whole Fleet set sail, and before Noon of the same day, were quite out of fight.</P>
<P>'Tis said, that the whole Fleet, <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> consisted of 48 Sail, or 56, as was said by others; particularly that the <HI>English</HI> Fleet was composed of 3 First Rates, the <HI>Britannia,</HI> the <HI>Sovereign,</HI> and the St. <HI>Andrew;</HI> 6 of the Second, 18 of the Third, 6 of which carried 80 great Guns apiece; 6 of the Fourth, 2 of the Fifth, 6 of the Sixth, together with 9 Fire-Ships: which were to be reinforced by 23 Sail more, that lay at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and to be farther also joyn'd by the Men of War, and Galleys of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time, <HI>Nouailles</HI> being ready to take the Field in <HI>Catalogna, Tourville</HI> was sent down to <HI>Toulon,</HI> to hasten out the <HI>French</HI> Fleet with all the speed imaginable; and he was so quick, that he was got with a Squdron of Men of War in∣to the Road of <HI>Toulon,</HI> and was ready to set Sail. But upon the 9th of <HI>May,</HI> so violent a Storm, attended with Thunder and Lightning, arose in those Parts, that the Admirals Ship; and Two more, were so much endamag'd in their Masts, that it was the 14th before he could put to Sea, in order to joyn the Galleys, and so set fayl together towards the Coasts of <HI>Catalogna,</HI> where he was to assist with his Bombs from the Sea, while the <HI>French</HI> attacked the Sea-port Towns of that Province by Land. To that purpose, he sail'd away with the Galleys from <HI>Marseilles,</HI> to the Bay of <HI>Roses,</HI> where he was joyn'd by <HI>Chasteau Renaut,</HI> with a Squadron from <HI>Brest.</HI></P>
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
<P>And now the <HI>French</HI> carri'd all things before them in <HI>Ca∣talogna; Tourville</HI> rode Triumphant at Sea, and <HI>Nouailles,</HI> Vi∣ctorious by Land; had won <HI>Palamos</HI> and <HI>Gironne,</HI> and there was no question but that <HI>Barcellona</HI> would have been the next that would have been Besieg'd; which seem'd indeed to be the principal Design of that Campaign. But the Ti∣dings that Admiral <HI>Russel</HI> was approaching toward the <HI>Streights,</HI> quite alter'd the Measures of the <HI>French;</HI> so that <HI>Tourville</HI> instead of sailing from <HI>Palamos</HI> to <HI>Barcellona</HI> according to his First Orders, was directed to return to <HI>Toulon,</HI> with all the hast he could. And indeed 'twas a lucky Escape for the <HI>French</HI> Admiral, who got into <HI>Toulon</HI> but the 4th of <HI>July;</HI> whereas Admiral <HI>Russel,</HI> as the Letters from <HI>Marseilles</HI> at that time confirm'd, appear'd at the heighth of <HI>Barcellona</HI> the 7th.</P>
<P>However it were, it was not to be imagin'd, that the Confederate Fleet, which could sail no faster than the Wind could carry them along, and of whose Motion the <HI>French</HI> Court was able to give more speedy Intelligence, and as much as was necessary for <HI>Tourville</HI>'s Preservation, more conveniently than the Admiral could hasten to prevent it; for these Rea∣sons, I say, it was not to be imagin'd, that the Confederate Fleet could easily surprize the <HI>French.</HI> After the <HI>English</HI> Ad∣miral had weigh'd, and set forward from St. <HI>Hellens,</HI> there was little or no News heard of him; only that he was seen to pass at a distance by <HI>Dartmouth</HI> and <HI>Plimouth</HI> the 5th of <HI>June;</HI> and that upon the Ninth at Night, the <HI>Alliance</HI> Packet-Boat bound from <HI>Corona</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> in her Voyage to <HI>Fal∣mouth,</HI> discover'd a great number of Lights to the South West of <HI>Ʋshant,</HI> which he judg'd to be the Fleet under Admiral <HI>Russel.</HI> To which we may add the Report of the Master of another Vessel which put into <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> and about the same time, brought Advice, that he met Admiral <HI>Russel</HI> in the heighth of <HI>Lagos,</HI> in <HI>Portugal,</HI> steering toward the <HI>Streights</HI> with a favourable Wind. So that after it was heard, that he had doubled the Cape of St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> between <HI>Lisbon</HI> and <HI>Ca∣diz,</HI> the first Express that came from him, and was received at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> was dated on Board the <HI>Britannia,</HI> the first of
<PB N="6" REF="6"/><HI>July,</HI> Old Stile, off of <HI>Tangier,</HI> wherein the Admiral gave an Account that he had not so much as touch'd at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> but that he had sent Orders to Rear Admiral <HI>Nevil,</HI> who rode in that Bay, with a Squadron of <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Men of War, to joyn him to the Westward of Cape <HI>Spartel;</HI> which they accordingly did on the 30th of <HI>June.</HI> Farther, that when those Letters were written, he was hastning with all the speed he could toward <HI>Barcellona,</HI> being inform'd that the <HI>French</HI> Fleet lay between that Place and <HI>Alfagues.</HI> That he had likewise order'd the <HI>Turkey</HI> Ships both <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> together with the Men of War appointed for their Convoy, to make the best of their way to <HI>Cartagena,</HI> and there to stay for such farther Orders which he should send them from <HI>Alicant,</HI> according to the Intelligence which he should re∣ceive of the Enemy.</P>
<P>Upon the 13th of <HI>July,</HI> the same welcom News was sent by an Express from <HI>Cadiz</HI> to <HI>Madrid,</HI> where the Tydings were joyfully received in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Court, that Admiral <HI>Russel</HI> had passed by that Harbour with the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet toward the <HI>Streights,</HI> having sent in a small Frigate before, with Orders to Rear Admiral <HI>Nevil,</HI> to joyn him near Cape <HI>Spartel.</HI> This Frigate arriv'd at <HI>Cadiz</HI> the 8th of the same Month, and the next Morning the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Squa∣dron, together with Ten Spanish Men of War which lay in that Bay, sail'd away all together with a fair Wind. And now fearless of Molestation, divers Satees and other small Vessels were order'd from <HI>Cadiz,</HI> Port St. <HI>Mary,</HI> and St. <HI>Lu∣car,</HI> freighted with above 2000 Souldiers and Sea-men, for the Succour of <HI>Barcellona,</HI> to <HI>Malaga;</HI> where lay Six Galleys ready to convoy them, with Sixteen more that were gon before to <HI>Cartagena,</HI> in expectation of others that were to joyn them, which being joyn'd, would make Twenty Eight in all, and were to attend the main Fleet, or at least the greatest part of them.</P>
<P>Upon the 23d of <HI>July,</HI> an Express from <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> brought News to the Court at <HI>Madrid,</HI> that the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Squadron commanded by Rear Admiral <HI>Nevil,</HI> and the Ten <HI>Spanish</HI> Men of War, had joyn'd Admiral <HI>Russel</HI> upon the
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>10th and 11th of the same Month near <HI>Tangier;</HI> at what time the whole Fleet was stop'd by a strong <HI>Levant,</HI> till the 15th; when the Wind chopping about to the West, they past through the <HI>Streights</HI> the same day, steering their Course toward <HI>Bar∣cellona.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the 17th of <HI>July,</HI> Capt. <HI>Banks</HI> in the <HI>Carslile</HI> Frigate, with Four Ketches, was sent to <HI>Malaga,</HI> to setch fresh Pro∣visions for the Fleet, which he rejoyn'd the next day, still directing its course for <HI>Barcellona:</HI> For the <HI>English</HI> Admiral thought it not convenient to come in sight of <HI>Malaga,</HI> but pass'd by it the same day that he sent Capt. <HI>Banks</HI> thither, keeping more to the Shore of <HI>Barbary.</HI> All this while no <HI>French</HI> Fleet appear'd; only Six of their Men of War were seen off <HI>Almeria,</HI> upon the 13th, where they would have had Provisions for their Money, but it was refus'd them; they being suppos'd to be Scouts sent forth to get intelli∣gence of the Confederate Fleet. In the mean time, the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchants Ships bound for <HI>Turkey</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> under the Convoy of Five Men of War, proceeded unmolested in their Voyages.</P>
<P>On the 8th of <HI>August,</HI> Admiral <HI>Russel</HI> arrived before <HI>Bar∣cellona</HI> with the whole Fleet, consisting of about 140 Sail, of which 88 were Ships of Line. He had met with several Re∣mora's, occasion'd by contrary Winds, which render'd the Voyage somewhat Tedious, though every Moment were im∣prov'd to hasten it. Of this Marshal <HI>Novailles</HI> gave the King of <HI>France</HI> advice, by an Express from his Camp at <HI>Blaines,</HI> (not far from <HI>Barcellona</HI>) adding withal, that while Admiral <HI>Russel</HI> anchor'd before the City, Two and Twenty of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Galleys came before the Place; and making in as close to the Shore as they could, Canonado'd the <HI>French</HI> Troops that were posted near the Shoar.</P>
<P>Admiral <HI>Russel</HI> continu'd before <HI>Barcellona</HI> with the whole Fleet riding in Three Lines, from the 8th to the 26th, at what time he weigh'd, and the next day appear'd before <HI>Blaines,</HI> which is about Four Leagues from <HI>Palamos.</HI> And there was no question but the <HI>English</HI> Admiral would have been glad that Marshal <HI>Tourville</HI> would have tarry'd for his coming. But
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>upon the News of his Approach to the <HI>Streights,</HI> or, at least, of his having pass'd the <HI>Streights,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Admiral instead of Sailing to <HI>Barcellona</HI> to assist <HI>Nouailles</HI> in the Siege of that Place, according to his first Orders, made a speedy return to <HI>Toulon,</HI> and was so early in his Retreat, that he enter'd that Port upon the 4th of <HI>July.</HI> And such was his fear of being assayl'd in the Harbour, that he sent away some part of the Galleys to <HI>Marseilles,</HI> and moor'd the rest before his Men of War for their better Security: And more than this, he took out the great Guns out of the great Men of War, to make Batteries upon the Shore; for the raising of which, his Men wrought Day and Night, and of which he try'd the firm∣ness, and how far they were able to annoy an Assayling Ene∣my, after they were finish'd. He also caus'd the biggest of his Ships to be hail'd within the Castles. He also caus'd se∣veral Pieces of Canon to be planted upon the Islands near <HI>Marsailles.</HI> And still for the security of the great Ships at <HI>Toulon,</HI> he order'd moreover a strong Chain and a Boom to be laid cross the Entrance of the Port. Nor was all this thought sufficient, till besides all these Precautions, he had rais'd a New Fort, which was call'd <HI>Fort Tourville,</HI> to defend the en∣trance into the Haven.</P>
<P>This was a sign, that the <HI>French</HI> Admiral lay under great Apprehensions of Danger; and yet in the midst of these fears, it was then reported, that <HI>Tourville</HI> held a Council of War, wherein it was debated, whether he should put to Sea and fight the Confederate Fleet, upon an Imagination that the Sea-men were tyr'd out with the length of their Voyage, and Sickly; upon which Suppositions, he thought there might be some Advantage gain'd. But it was carri'd in the Nega∣tive, all the Officers alledging, that the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> were no fresh-water Souldiers, and therefore that it would be a Madness to engage so formidable a Fleet. However it was at the same time confirm'd, that the whole Coast of <HI>Provence</HI> was in a great Consternation, and that the Inhabitants of the Sea-Towns carry'd away the best of their Goods up higher in∣to the Country, for fear of being Bomb'd in their Houses. The Court of <HI>France</HI> also was not a little mistrustful of their
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>own Sea-men; and therefore fearing least the Officers and Sea-men belonging to the Galleys should play their Officers a scurvy Trick upon the appearing of the Confederate Fleet upon the Coasts of <HI>Provence,</HI> remitted to <HI>Marsailles</HI> an Hundred Thousand Livres, for the payment of part of their Wages, thereby to engage them to stand firm in their Duty.</P>
<P>On the other side, there was great Joy in the Court of <HI>Madrid,</HI> to hear of the Arrival of the Confederate Fleet upon the Coasts of <HI>Spain.</HI> The King particularly, as a de∣monstration of his great satisfaction, sent a Present of a Jewel to the <HI>English</HI> Admiral, valued at Five and Twenty Thousand Crowns, and another to Vice Admiral <HI>Calenberg,</HI> valued at Twelve Thousand.</P>
<P>When the Confederate Fleet arriv'd in the Bay of <HI>Bar∣cellona,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Escalona,</HI> Viceroy of <HI>Catalogna,</HI> went on Board the <HI>Britannia,</HI> to Compliment the Admiral, and during their Interview, all the Canon of the Fleet, and the City, were discharg'd Three times. The next day Admiral <HI>Russel</HI> went Ashore to repay the Viceroy his Visit; who received him with all the Honour and Respect that was due to his Person. After a Conference of a little more than an Hour, there was held a Council of War; at the Conclusion of which, the Admiral return'd to his Ship. The Viceroy also sent him as a Present, a Hundred and Fifty Sheep, Four Calves, Six Hundred Candles of Virgins Wax, Six Hundred Tallow Candles, Six Hundred Pound of Choco∣late, One Thousand Six Hundred Pound of Sugar, a great number of Capons, Pullets and Turkies, a great quantity of Pulse, and all sorts of Fruits, a Hundred Barrels of Excellent Wine, and proportionably of other Liquors, with a proportionable quantity of Snow to cool his Wine. The Magistracy also of <HI>Barcellona</HI> made him a Present of Two <HI>Barbary</HI> Horses richly harnessed, to the value of Three Hundred Pistoles.</P>
<P>And now to return to the Course of the Confederate Fleet, Admiral <HI>Russel</HI> having stay'd before <HI>Barcellona</HI> from the 8th to the 26th of <HI>August,</HI> set sail from thence the
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>same Day, no body knowing what Course he intended to steer; only that he proceeded as sar as <HI>Blanes,</HI> Four Leagues beyond <HI>Barcellona,</HI> as the Letters from <HI>Toulon</HI> signified. For Mounsieur <HI>Tourville</HI> no sooner heard of Admiral <HI>Russel</HI>'s leaving <HI>Barcellona,</HI> but he sent out several light Frigates to get intelligence of his Motions; but whether it were that the <HI>English</HI> Admiral was well inform'd that the <HI>French</HI> Fleet was too strongly Barricado'd up in the Port of <HI>Toulon,</HI> to be attack'd without time and leisure, or that perhaps he had not then received his Orders to winter in the <HI>Me∣diterranean;</HI> and therefore finding the Season far spent, thought it high time to return back into the Ocean, he steer'd back again for the <HI>Streights,</HI> and upon the 5th of <HI>September,</HI> pass'd by <HI>Alicant,</HI> with a fair Wind; and the next Day in the Afternoon, the whole Fleet pass'd by <HI>Car∣tagena,</HI> with the <HI>Spanish</HI> Men of War, the Gallies only being order'd back to <HI>Cartagena;</HI> and upon the 15th he came before <HI>Malaga.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time, the <HI>French</HI> Admiral meditated Two Designs, either to slip by the Confederate Fleet, and get before Admiral <HI>Russel</HI> with the Squadrons of <HI>Brest,</HI> into the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, while the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> were busied in the more distant part of <HI>Provence;</HI> for there was a Rumour spread abroad, of an intended Bombing of <HI>Nice,</HI> or else to watch the return of the Fleet to the <HI>Streights,</HI> and sail away a second time for <HI>Barcellona,</HI> where <HI>Nouailles</HI> lay ready, together with such new Succours as he should bring him, to finish the Conquest of <HI>Catalogna.</HI> The first he had received Orders at one time to attempt, when Ad∣miral <HI>Russel</HI> cover'd <HI>Barcellona;</HI> but upon better Conside∣rations, the Court of <HI>France</HI> not finding it feasible to get by a watchful Enemy without being encounter'd, discharg'd him of those Cares.</P>
<P>As to the second, so soon as Admiral <HI>Russel</HI>'s Back was turn'd, and while there was yet no certainty of Admiral <HI>Russel</HI>'s wintring in the <HI>Mediterranean, Nouailles</HI> and <HI>Tourville</HI> were in great hopes, that they together, might carry <HI>Bar∣celona</HI> before the end of the Campaign; and the Court of
<PB N="11" REF="8"/><HI>France</HI> flatter'd her self with the same Expectations. <HI>Tour∣ville</HI> therefore having sent before Seven or Eight Men of War, and some Fiteships, under the Command of Monsieur <HI>Beaujeu,</HI> on which were embark'd several Regiments, set sail with the rest of the Fleet for the Coast of <HI>Catalogna.</HI> The News of this sayling of the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, carrying with it some Thousands of Land Souldiers for the Rein∣forcement of <HI>Nouailles,</HI> and the Marching thither at the same time of a considerable Body of <HI>French</HI> Horse by Land, made all People believe that some great Enterprize was to be undertaken on that side, and that the Siege of <HI>Barcelona</HI> was resolv'd upon. About the same time also, Three <HI>French</HI> Men of War, of Sixty and Seventy Guns, appeared off of <HI>Alicant,</HI> attended by a Fireship, which gave a suspicion of a greater Number. All these things put together, brought Admiral <HI>Russel</HI> again into <HI>Alicant</HI> Road, where he cast Anchor upon the 20th of <HI>September,</HI> New Stile: Of which when the <HI>French</HI> were inform'd, and moreover that it was resolv'd that the Confederate Fleet should winter in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> new Orders were dis∣patch'd away from Court to the Marshal, which he re∣ceived just as he was beginning to land his Men at <HI>Pala∣mos</HI> and <HI>Blanes;</HI> so that he was forced to return again with all the speed he could to <HI>Toulon,</HI> where he arrived the 23d of <HI>September,</HI> having scap'd Two very terrible Storms, one at his setting out, which brought him again into Har∣bour to repair the Masts and Rigging of several Men of War; the second at his Return, which scatter'd his Ships, though they all rejoyn'd at length, except one large Man of War, which had several Companies of Souldiers A∣board, and a Fly-boat laden with Bombs and Mortars. Af∣ter which disappointment and ill success, they fell to un∣rigging their Ships, the whole Fleet being order'd to be laid up.</P>
<P>While Admiral <HI>Russel</HI> lay in the Road of <HI>Alicant,</HI> he was taken ill of a Fever; but after he had been some days ashore in that City, was perfectly restor'd to his Health, and return'd Aboard the Fleet, a considerable Squadron
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>of which had however been cruising as far as <HI>Minorca,</HI> un∣der the Command of Vice Admiral <HI>Aylmer,</HI> to see if he could get sight of the <HI>French.</HI> But hearing no News of the Enemy, he came to an Anchor again in the same Road the 2d of <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>Much about the same time, Six <HI>Dutch</HI> Privateers as they were Cruising not far from the Island of <HI>Maltha,</HI> came up with Two <HI>French</HI> Men of War, the one of Sixty, the o∣ther of Forty Four Guns, having Four Merchants Ships richly laden from <HI>Smyrna</HI> under their Convoy; upon which the Privateers attack'd the Two Men of War, and so rudely handl'd the biggest, that she was forced to bear a∣way for <HI>Maltha</HI> to save her self; but the Privateers took the other, together with the Four Merchant Men. At the same time also Three <HI>Zealand</HI> Privateers cruising near <HI>Sicily,</HI> took a <HI>French</HI> Frigate of Eighteen Guns, and an Hundred and Ten Men, on Board of which, they found Ten Thousand Pieces of Eight in ready Money. And while one of the Privateers guarded the Prize to <HI>Palermo,</HI> the other Two met Three <HI>French</HI> Men of War, of Sixty and Forty Guns, which they fought several Hours, till Night parted them.</P>
<P>This quick Return of Marshal <HI>Tourville</HI> to <HI>Toulon,</HI> upon Admiral <HI>Russel</HI>'s sayling back to <HI>Alicant,</HI> was in some measure ridicul'd by the <HI>French</HI> themselves, as appear'd by a Letter written from <HI>Paris,</HI> upon occasion of <HI>Tourville</HI>'s Retreat, to this effect.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<PB N="13" REF="9"/>
<P><HI>THE quick Return of our Fleet to</HI> Toulon, <HI>gives occasion to various Discourses; what the Success was, is publickly known: The Managers only feel the Thorns of it. We shall have neither any Engagement, nor any Siege of</HI> Barcellona <HI>this Year: 'Twas not thought convenient to hazard the one, nor attempt the other. Yet all things seem'd to tend to a Tryal of these Two Events. The Departure of the whole Fleet, and the Expence of setting it out, with Bomb Galliots and Mortars, shew'd that there was something else intend∣ed, than a bare Landing of Men; nor did they send their Horse by Land, to go up the Hill, and so come down again. Yet all are returned or returning, both Fleet and Cavalry. Whatever the Reasons were, the Campaign is now at an end, and the Court are at their Wits end, what Course to take with the Fleet, whose lying still, or doing nothing to the purpose, is laught at in all the Courts of</HI> Europe.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>When it was that Admiral <HI>Russel</HI> receiv'd his Orders from <HI>England</HI> to Winter in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> is not ma∣terial. Certain it is however, that when he understood that the Marshal was gone back, and that the intended At∣tempt upon <HI>Barcellona</HI> was given over, he set sail from the Road of <HI>Alicant</HI> upon the Fifth of <HI>October,</HI> sending away the <HI>Greyhound</HI> Frigate to the Bay of <HI>Gibralter,</HI> with Orders to such <HI>English</HI> Men of War as lay there, to joyn him at Cape <HI>Spartell,</HI> where he intended to cruise for some time, in order to meet the <HI>French,</HI> in case they should attempt to pass the <HI>Streights.</HI> This was written from <HI>Malaga;</HI> and other Letters dated the 12th of <HI>October</HI> from <HI>Cadiz,</HI> affirm'd, in Confirmation of the former Intelligence, that the whole Fleet under the Command of Admiral <HI>Russel,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="10"/>appear'd in the sight of that Port the same Day; and that at the same time also an Hundred Sail of Ships from <HI>England,</HI> with Provisions and other Necessaries for the Fleet, under the Convoy of several Men of War, arriv'd in that Port.</P>
<P>In the mean time, it was confirm'd on all Hands by fresh Intelligence, that the <HI>French</HI> were unrigging all their Men of War at <HI>Toulon,</HI> except Six, who were to Cruise during the Winter; and that the Sea-men of the Western Provinces, were to return back by Land to <HI>Brest.</HI></P>
<P>But notwithstanding those Confirmations, Admiral <HI>Russd</HI> careful to avoid all Surprises of the <HI>French,</HI> under the pre∣tence of unrigging their Ships, though he appear'd before <HI>Cadiz</HI> upon the 12th of <HI>October,</HI> yet kept off at Sea for several Days; nor was it till the 17th, that he came to Anchor in the Bay of the same Place, after he had le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t se∣veral Men of War to cruise in the Streights. All this while, notwithstanding the Rumours spread abroad by the <HI>French,</HI> to lessen the Fears of the People, that there was a great Mortality, and want of Provisions in the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, and that they had lost one third part of their Men, the whole Fleet continued Healthy, and in a good Condition, as being all along carefully pro∣vided with all things necessary, both as to the Men and Ships.</P>
<P>At length however, the <HI>English</HI> Admiral who lay ready to sail, in order to cruise about the <HI>Streights</HI> Mouth, be∣ing assur'd that the <HI>French</HI> were in earnest as to the un∣rigging their Ships, and that there was no fear of their ma∣king any farther Attempts that Season, he took up his station in the Bay of <HI>Cadiz,</HI> about the beginning of <HI>No∣vember;</HI> where he first gave order for the Cleaning and Careening of the smaller Ships with all the speed that pos∣sibly could be, in order to their Cruising, intending after∣words to do the like by the Great ones. In the mean time, the Duke of <HI>Sesta,</HI> Captain General of <HI>Andalusia,</HI> and <HI>Don Francisco de Velasco,</HI> Governour of <HI>Cadiz.</HI> went
<PB N="15" REF="10"/>several times on Board the <HI>English</HI> Admiral, to pay him their Respects; which Visits of his, the Admiral repay'd with equal Civility. 'Twas also said, that His Catholick Majesty had engag'd to pay five Hundred Thousand Crowns toward the Expences of the Confederate Fleet in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> and that Assignments had been already receiv'd for a good part of the Sum.</P>
<P>In this same Posture of Affairs, the main Business now was to keep some Men of War always in a readiness to prevent all sinister Events, and to send forth other Fri∣gates upon the scout, to discover what Ships the Enemy had Abroad, and for the preservation of the Merchants Trade. And this continual Cruising of the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> had such good success, that the Commerce of the <HI>French</HI> received considerable Interruption almost every day. About the 20th of <HI>October,</HI> were brought into <HI>Cadiz,</HI> be∣sides those already mentioned, a <HI>French</HI> Man of War of Twenty Four Guns. and an <HI>Algerine,</HI> having on Board Two Hundred <HI>Turkish</HI> Passengers, with a great many Presents for the <HI>Grand Seignor,</HI> the whole being valued at Four Hundred Thousand Pieces of Eight. Captain <HI>Cornwall</HI> in the <HI>Adventure,</HI> took Two <HI>French</HI> Prizes as they were sayling through the <HI>Streights</HI> Mouth, bound from <HI>Marseilles</HI> to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> very richly laden with Silks and other valuable Commodities, and brought them into <HI>Cadiz</HI> upon the 30th of <HI>September.</HI> Capt. <HI>Watton</HI> in the <HI>Lark,</HI> took a <HI>French</HI> Prize laden with Fish from <HI>Newsound∣land,</HI> and carri'd her into the same Port, upon the 9th of <HI>October.</HI> The <HI>Mary Galley</HI> and <HI>Grey-hound,</HI> carried in another Prize upon the 12th, bound from <HI>Lisbon</HI> to <HI>Mar∣seilles;</HI> and the same day the <HI>Portsmouth Galley</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> with Two <HI>French</HI> Satee's bound from <HI>Sally</HI> to <HI>Marseilles.</HI> About the middle of <HI>December,</HI> the <HI>Dragon</HI> took a <HI>French</HI> Man of War that carri'd Thirty Six Guns, and Two Hundred Men, call'd the <HI>Spheare,</HI> upon the Coast of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and sail'd away with his Prize to <HI>Cadiz.</HI> So that the Damage which the <HI>French</HI> sustain'd by the Cruising of the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> in the <HI>Spanish</HI> and
<PB N="16" REF="11"/><HI>Mediterranean</HI> Seas, was no less than the loss of Nineteen Prizes, among which were Seven Merchant-Men richly laden, and all this before the end of <HI>November.</HI> Nor must we omit another very Rich Ship, bound from <HI>Marseilles</HI> to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> said to be worth several Hundred Thousand Pieces of Eight, which was taken about the beginning of <HI>January,</HI> by Two <HI>Dutch</HI> Privateers that cruis'd about <HI>Maltha.</HI></P>
<P>Toward the latter end of <HI>January,</HI> the Letters from <HI>Ca∣diz</HI> gave an Account, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were diligently preparing to get their Men of War ready to joyn the Confederates, who by that time had Careen'd the greatest part of the Fleet; Admiral <HI>Russel</HI> all the while restrain∣ing both Souldiers and Sea-men under the Severity of an exact Discipline, and was become so Formidable in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> that the <HI>Divan</HI> of <HI>Algier,</HI> thought it high time to court him; and to that purpose sent the follow∣ing Letter.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<PB N="17" REF="11"/>
<HEAD>The Vice-Governour <HI>Ibrahim E∣standi,</HI> and all the <HI>Divan,</HI> to the Renowned Admiral, and Valiant General <HI>Russel,</HI> our Dear and Well-beloved and Faithful Friend, so well esteemed also by that Christian King, whose King∣dom may it be always prudent∣ly govern'd, Greeting.</HEAD>
<P>WE write this Letter to you, protesting that 'tis impossible to express our Friendship for you, nor to utter it in our Words. We beseech the Almighty God, that your Enemies and ours, may be reduced to that Extremity, that they may be always unable to withstand your Power. And it is our Desire, that the Friendship which is between us, may every manner of way increase. God be praised, for that this Year you are come into the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, to our great Joy. The Ship, which you sent us, is happily arrived in this Port, and the Captain, who is at your Service, together with the Consul, who in all Places, and upon all occa∣sions, loudly speak your Fame, have delivered the Letter which you wrote to us and the <HI>Divan,</HI> wherein we find Assurances of your own, and the Friendship of your great King: Upon which, we caus'd all the Canon of our Castle
<PB N="18" REF="12"/>to be discharg'd, to the great joy of those that love us, and the terror of our Enemies. We are assured, that the <HI>English</HI> are the best Friends we have, and we beseech God to preserve both them and us from all Evil. We were extreamly overjoyed at the sight of these Ships, and we shall take great delight to behold them, as often as your Affairs will permit. We admir'd the Prudence and Conduct of your Captain, in the Proofs which he gave of his good With, and in his whole manner of Act∣ing; but we were not in a capacity to shew him that kindness which he merited. Our Thrice Fortunate Go∣vernor and Master is now besieging <HI>Tunis,</HI> with Thirty Thousand Men, which is the Reason of his Absence, and which we beg of you not to take in ill part; for so soon as it pleases God that he returns Victorious, the <HI>English</HI> will have no reason to be dissatisfied with the Testi∣monies of his Friendship. You likewise give us to un∣derstand, that your Master has granted our Desires, in setting Mr. <HI>Cole,</HI> a Person well known to us, to be his Agent and Consul amongus, and to recall our Ancient Friend Mr. <HI>Baker,</HI> to which we consent with all our Hearts. And yet, how is it possible he can leave us, be∣fore he sees our Fortunate Governour, his intimate Friend, It may be our Governour, when return'd, will send to the King of <HI>England</HI> other Letters, and other News, with greater Proofs of his Friendship. We expect him in Forty or Fifty Days. And though the Consul be very earnest to Embark, we all desire that he would be pleas'd to stay till our Governour's Return. We will have ready at his Service, whatever Ships shall be requisite for him, in case there be none that belong to his <HI>Britannic</HI> Majesty. And perhaps this little stay of his, as it may not be unprofitable to us, so neither
<PB N="19" REF="12"/>may it be dis-serviceable to your Monarch. This puts us in hope, that our Request will not be displeasing to you, but redound to the Consternation both of yours and our Enemies. We return you Thanks for defending our Ves∣sels against the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> We acknowledge your Fa∣vour, and beg of God, that in recompence of your Kind∣ness, he would afford you his Benediction. The <HI>Dutch</HI> were our Friends, when we were under another Gover∣nour, till the <HI>French</HI> both kindled and fomented the present War. The time will come when we shall re∣new our former Friendship, and Brotherly Union, if God blesses our good Friend, the King of <HI>England</HI> with Life. War is a strange thing, it causes more Vexa∣tion than Pleasure: Yet if the <HI>Hollanders</HI> are in A∣mity with the King of <HI>England,</HI> and desire to be our Friends, it may so fall out, that our Successor will ac∣cept of their Friendship. God grant that the Affection which the King of <HI>England</HI> has for you and us, and which we have for that Prince and you, may be always Cordial, Sincere, and of long Continuance. We recom∣mend you to the Peace of God.</P>

<P>Nor were the Calm Words of this Letter, the sole effect which the wintring of Admiral <HI>Russel</HI> wrought upon the Pyrates of <HI>Barbary;</HI> for upon the 5th of <HI>September</HI> last, Mr. <HI>Baker</HI> then Consul for the <HI>English</HI> Nation at <HI>Argier,</HI> went from thence in an <HI>Algerine</HI> Man of War for <HI>Tunis,</HI> and being conducted to the Camp of <HI>Shahan Dey,</HI> who then lay before that City, deliver'd to him the Letter from His Majesty of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> Upon which, the <HI>Dey</HI> calling together all the <HI>Tripoline</HI> Officers that were in the Camp, recommended to them the renewing the Peace which they had with the King of <HI>England;</HI> and having written to the same Effect, to the <HI>Dey</HI> of <HI>Tripoli,</HI> order'd a Man of War to carry Mr. <HI>Baker</HI> thither, where he was not only welcom'd with a Reception, but easily obtain'd his Desires, which ended in a Confirmation of Peace with the Governour of that Place, much to the Advantage of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, and as much to the Disappointment of the <HI>French,</HI> who endeavour'd all they could to prevent it. Though others say, it was Mr <HI>Lo∣dington</HI> who reviv'd that Pacification.</P>
<P>The 31th of <HI>December</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> under the Con∣voy of the <HI>Rupert,</HI> and several other Men of War, the Store-Ships and Victuallers that set Sail from the <HI>Spit-Head,</HI> the 5th of the same Month.</P>
<P>Upon the 26th of <HI>December,</HI> Ten <HI>English</HI> Men of War set sail from <HI>Cadiz,</HI> to cruise about the Coast of <HI>Portu∣gal;</HI> and Three Davs after, a <HI>Dutch</HI> Privateer carried into <HI>Cadiz,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Prize, which he had taken in the Mouth of the <HI>Streights,</HI> and sent it away for <HI>England,</HI> under a Convoy bound thither, with several Merchant Men.</P>
<P>Letters also from <HI>Madrid</HI> of the Sixth of <HI>January,</HI> New Stile, gave an account that the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Frigates cruising in the <HI>Streights,</HI> had taken and sent to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> Two Ships belonging to <HI>Genoa,</HI> as they said, but bound for several Ports of <HI>France,</HI> and richly laden.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="13"/>
<P>Soon after, a <HI>French</HI> Man of War sailing out of the River of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> with Two Merchant Men under her Convoy, Homeward bound, was taken by one of the Men of War, which Admiral <HI>Russel</HI> had sent to cruise upon the Coast of <HI>Portugal;</HI> and the Two Merchant Men had run the same Fate, had they not escaped by the fa∣vour of the Night. The Captain of the <HI>French</HI> Fri∣gate, whose Name was Monsieur <HI>De la Rochefueille,</HI> was afterwards set Ashore at <HI>Cascons,</HI> together with all his Men, to the number of Three Hundred. Nor was it long after, before Three <HI>Zeland</HI> Privateers carried into <HI>Cadiz,</HI> a <HI>Dunkirk</HI> Caper of Twenty Guns.</P>
<P>Toward the beginning of <HI>March,</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Whitehal</HI> the News of an Engagement between Capt. <HI>Killegrew,</HI> and certain <HI>French</HI> Men of War in the <HI>Mediterranean.</HI> The Relations were imperfect at first, That Capt. <HI>Killegrew</HI> ha∣ving with him a Squadron of Seven <HI>English</HI> Men of War, sent away. Three of them to cruise in the Channel of <HI>Malta,</HI> and Three about Cape <HI>Pessaro,</HI> while he remain'd with his single Ship in the <HI>Fare</HI> of <HI>Messina;</HI> that quickly after Capt. <HI>Killegrew</HI> fell in with Two <HI>French</HI> Men of War, one of Sixty, the other of Fifty Guns, and engag'd them both for the space of Four Hours; at what time upon the Report of the Guns, one of the Men of War that had been sent away to cruise, came into his Assistance, and so well seconded Captain <HI>Killegrew,</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> be∣took themselves to a running Fight, and that in a short time after, the Ship of Fifty Guns surrendred, but soon after sunk; and that the other having all her Masts shot by the Board, yielded also, and was carried to <HI>Messina.</HI> This Relation likewise gave an Account, that there were Seven Hundred Men Aboard the Two <HI>French</HI> Men of War, the one half of which were Kill'd and Wounded, and that Capt. <HI>Killegrew</HI> was kill'd in the Fight, and about Fifty of his Men Kill'd and Wounded.</P>
<P>In the mean time other Letters from <HI>Madrid,</HI> of the Ninth of <HI>February,</HI> New Stile, gave an Account that his Majesties Ship the <HI>Plimouth,</HI> was sail'd up the <HI>Streights</HI> to
<PB N="22" REF="14"/>Cruise, but said nothing of this Fight. The same Letters also farther added, that upon the First of <HI>January,</HI> the <HI>De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sord</HI> Man of War returned to <HI>Cadiz</HI> from Cruising, and brought in with her, Two Vessels of <HI>Genoa,</HI> to be search'd, and Two <HI>French</HI> Prizes, the one a Ship of Six∣teen Guns bound from <HI>Marseilles</HI> to St. <HI>Malo</HI>'s, and the other a Brigantine of the same Place, bound to <HI>Marteni∣go;</HI> and moreover, that the great Ships were then Careen∣ing.</P>
<P>Soon after, came other Letters from <HI>Madrid,</HI> dated <HI>Feb.</HI> 17th, giving an Account that Two <HI>English</HI> Men of War were arrived at <HI>Bilboa,</HI> who had taken a <HI>French</HI> Pri∣vateer of Eighteen Guns belonging to St. <HI>Malo,</HI> and re∣taken an <HI>English</HI> Ship bound Home from <HI>Virginia.</HI> O∣ther Letters also of the 23d of <HI>February,</HI> gaye notice, that the Men of War and Merchants Vessels which were laden with Provisions and Stores for the Fleet, and which set sail from the Spit head about the middle of <HI>January,</HI> were all safely arriv'd at <HI>Cadiz.</HI></P>
<P>But upon the 11th of <HI>March,</HI> was published a more ample Relation of the Engagement of Captain <HI>Killegrew,</HI> and the Two <HI>French</HI> Men of War; giving an Account, that upon the 20 of <HI>February,</HI> a <HI>Venetian</HI> Ship arriving at <HI>Leghorn,</HI> from the Coast of <HI>Sicily,</HI> brought in News of an Engagement in the Channel of <HI>Malta,</HI> between some <HI>English,</HI> and Two <HI>French</HI> Men of War, and that the Two latter were taken: Which was also confirm'd by a Bark that arriv'd at the same Port, in Eight days from <HI>Messina,</HI> with the sollowing Circumstances.</P>
<P>The <HI>Plimouth, Carlisle, Newcastle, Southampton, Falmouth</HI> and <HI>Adventure</HI> Frigates, the First being a Third Rate of Sixty Two Guns, and all the rest Fourth Rates, cruising very near the Island of <HI>Pantalaria,</HI> upon the 28th of the last Month, early in the Morning, discovered Two <HI>French</HI> Men of War, one of Seventy Guns, named the <HI>Content,</HI> commanded by the Marquis <HI>de Chalard;</HI> the other call'd the <HI>Trident,</HI> of Sixty Guns, commanded by the Count <HI>D' Anoy,</HI> who supposing the <HI>English</HI> Frigates to be Mer∣chant

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>AN ABSTRACT OF A LETTER FROM THE <HI>Count de Chalard,</HI> TO THE French Court.</HEAD>
<P>UPon the 28th of <HI>January, (says he,)</HI> early in the Morning, we discovered Six Sail, which we judged to be <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>By Two a Clock in the Afternoon, we were joyn'd by a Vessel, which as we judg'd, carried about Six Guns, which came up within Pistol Shot before she fir'd a Gun. The <HI>Trident</HI> and I fought her for some time, but she being soon after join'd by some others that were the most nimble Saylers of her Squadron, the <HI>Trident</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="15"/>divided her Fire, while I ply'd the first Vessel altoge ther till Night came on; at what time my Adversary having lost one of her Masts, kept off; but then I was attack'd by another Vessel, which left the <HI>Trident,</HI> to fall upon me.</P>
<P>All this while the <HI>Trident</HI> fought with great Violence, suffering several Discharges from those that came toward the <HI>Content;</HI> but she lost one of her Masts a little be∣fore Night came on: After which I saw no more of her. In the Condition that I was, I sail'd toward the Isle of <HI>Maretimo,</HI> being continually chas'd by Three Ships, of which one was as big as the <HI>Content,</HI> which joyn'd me about Seven at Night, and fought me about Two Hours, and very much disabl'd me. However I continued my course as well as I could.</P>
<P>The next Day in the Morning, I was rejoyn'd by the Ship that fought me the Evening before, which was follow'd by Two more; so that by Ten a Clock in the Morning I lost my Main Mast.</P>
<P>The Enemy pursu'd their Advantage, and in the Af∣ternoon cut down my Mizon, and all the rest of my Masts; so that the great Ship play'd upon me as she pleas'd her self; for we had neither Helm nor Sails left to govern our Ship. For which reason, finding my self in this piti∣ful condition, I call'd the Officers together to have their Advice, who all testified their willingness to sacrifice their Lives for the King's Service; but considering the Condition of the Ship, and the Superior Number of the Enemy, it was resolv'd that we should yield, which was done the 29th, at Four in the Afternoon.</P>
<P>The Officers and the Marine Guards, behav'd them∣selves with extraordinary Courage and Bravery.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="16"/>
<P>After we had yielded, we were put Aboard the <HI>Carlisle;</HI> by the Captain of which Vessel we were ex∣treamly well used; nor did they take away our Swords, which was done out of a particular esteem which they had for my Person.</P>
<P>We were carried to <HI>Messina,</HI> where we met the other <HI>English</HI> Men of War, and the Officers of the <HI>Trident,</HI> which far'd no better than we did, though the Officers and Souldiers behav'd themselves with all the Bravery imaginable. And the next day that we arrived in the Port, the Governour of <HI>Messina</HI> sent us a Civil Com∣pliment, offering to serve us to the utmost of his Power, and order'd us to want for nothing. <HI>This Letter was subscrib'd</HI></P>

</LETTER>
<P>Upon the 8th of <HI>March,</HI> Five <HI>English,</HI> and Four <HI>Dutch</HI> Men of War, sail'd away from <HI>Cadiz,</HI> to meet the Home∣ward bound <HI>Turky</HI> Ships, and the <HI>Mary, Canterbury, Dra∣gon,</HI> and <HI>Mury Galley</HI> returned from Cruising. And much about the same time Rear Admiral <HI>Nevil</HI> was going out with another Squadron of <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Men of War.</P>
<P>Toward the beginning of <HI>April,</HI> the <HI>Portsmouth, Grey∣hound</HI> and <HI>Lark</HI> returned from Cruising, having been as far as <HI>Toulon,</HI> where they took a fisher Boat with Six Men, who confirm'd what had been reported before, that the <HI>French</HI> had no design to fit out their Fleet at <HI>Toulon,</HI> but that they were Fortisying the Town and the Haven, to secure it against the Assaults of the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch:</HI> More-especially, that they were at work to Cleanse and Fortify a small Port in <HI>Provence,</HI> wherein to lay up their Galleys, as believing they will be more safe there, than at <HI>Mar∣seilles.</HI></P>
<PB N="27" REF="16"/>
<P>On the 6th of <HI>April,</HI> Seventeen <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Men of War set sail from <HI>Cadiz,</HI> under the Command of Roar Admiral <HI>Nevil;</HI> but upon the 9th, they were put back by contrary Winds.</P>
<P>Upon the 18th of <HI>April,</HI> Six <HI>English</HI> Frigates return'd to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> that set sail from thence some time before, having left in the Port of <HI>Messina,</HI> the Two <HI>French</HI> Ships of Seventy and Sixty Five Guns, which they took in the Channel of <HI>Malta.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the 20th of the same Month, Admiral <HI>Russel</HI> or∣der'd the whole Fleet to fire their Guns at a Minutes Di∣stance between the Firing of every Gun, as being a Solem∣nity due upon the first notice of the Queen's Funeral.</P>
<P>Upon the 22d of <HI>April,</HI> a numerous Fleet of Store-Ships, Victuallers, Bomb-ketches, Transport-Ships, and Merchant-Men, making in all Sixty Sail, arriv'd at <HI>Cadiz</HI> from <HI>England,</HI> under a Convoy of several Men of War, com∣manded by Captain <HI>Warren;</HI> and then it was said, that Ad∣miral <HI>Russel</HI> would speedily put to Sea with the whole Fleet. 'Tis also said, that there is an <HI>English</HI> Consul arriv'd at <HI>Rome,</HI> to assure that Court, that if the Confederate Fleet came into those Seas, it would not be to do the least Da∣mage to the Ecclesiastical State; and that he also at the same time demanded that the said Fleet might have leave to buy Fresh Provisions at <HI>Civita Vecchia,</HI> in case they should stand in need of them.</P>
<P>After this, the Letters of the 4th Instant, gave an Ac∣count, that the Fleet had lain several Days with their Top sails loose, so that 'twas generally believ'd they were put to Sea e're this.</P>
<P>Other Letters also from <HI>Coronna,</HI> gave an Account, that Two <HI>English</HI> Frigates had lately taken a <HI>French</HI> Privateer of Twenty Four Guns off of the Southern Cape; moreover that the <HI>Delaval</HI> had taken a Brigantine of Six Guns, and Seventy Men: And farther, that Captain <HI>Goade</HI> in the <HI>Boyn,</HI> has brought to <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> a Great <HI>French</HI> Ship richly laden, that pretended to be a <HI>Venetian.</HI></P>
<PB N="28" REF="17"/>
<P>Thus we have accompanied this Magnificent and For∣midable Fleet in all the last Summers Expedition, to the great disappointment of <HI>France,</HI> brought it into Har∣bour during the Winter, and seen it ready to put to Sea again. So that if the <HI>French</HI> have not made <HI>Toulon</HI> and <HI>Marseilles</HI> Inaccessible to Fire and Flames, and Impenetrable to the Batteries of Marine Thunder, it may be expected, and, we doubt not, but to give a more pleasing Relation of the Actions of this Summer, and fuller of Variety in the next Account.</P>
