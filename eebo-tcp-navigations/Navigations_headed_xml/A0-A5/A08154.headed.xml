<HEAD>A TRVE RELATION OF THE DAILY CONFLICTS, and proceedings betweene the great Turkes Armie, and his Maiestie of POLAND, <HI>to the end of the Warres.</HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Here shall neede no preamble, nor insinuation to this dis∣course, more then that you haue had already a published Pamph∣let of the newes of Poland, shewing plainely the occasion of the Turkes formidable pre∣paration against that Country, with his descending in person into Walachia, and comming to many skirmishes and battailes, afford∣ing as many rumors of the seuerall euents and suc∣cesses in the same; insomuch that many reported Poland was ouer-runne, and <HI>Sigismond</HI> slaine: Yet there is but one truth which that booke in generall sets out: yet so farre short of satisfaction, that it comes not neere any particular indeede, whereby men went away, as if they had onely looked on the outward painting and brauery of a house, without once being admitted to ouer-looke, how necessary
<PB N="2" REF="3"/> and conuenient it was in the inward roomes. There∣fore I will promise you amends, though in a plaine fashion, and this relation shall supply the defects of the other. For I will presently come to the pur∣pose, and begin with the beginning of September: after the Polacks had entrenched themselues, and the Turkes and Tartars came as neere them as might be.</P>
<P>Know then, that the second of September <HI>stilo no∣u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> the Turkes and Tartars encamped themselues by vs within a mile, or halfe a mile, and the same day began hotly vpon vs, brauing our trenches, which we would not endure, but came to blowes, and made a skirmish, in which eight hundred Turks perished, as by many Captiues and Prisoners, which we tooke in the flight, was afterward confessed, besides such as were slaine neere hand in the charges, and farre off with the Bullets, both of our field Peeces and Mus∣katieres: on our side perished <HI>Tarouits</HI> and <HI>Bochdan,</HI> two Commaunders of Light-horse, and the Lord <HI>Lauizza</HI> of the Cohort of the Camp-Master, was shot in the foot with a great Bullet, two Masters of the best men of Armes slaine, and aboue 30. other of seuerall Companies hurt.</P>
<P>The third of September, they proceeded in the same manner, and we with some light excursions set vpon them, till at last they burst out in three seuerall parts against our trenches, especially where our Cossacks were quartred, and so came to the very out-skirts of our Polish Army, who had command to keepe themselues within their Tents and Tren∣ches,
<PB N="3" REF="3"/> and annoy the Turkes with their great Artil∣lery, and so we prospered for that time, driuing them into their Campe, wherein by Sunne-setting they quickly retired: the same euening our noble Prince passed ouer the Riuer, and came into our Campe with all manner of comfort and courage, but the Army he brought with him, with prouision of war∣like Ordnance, and other Munition necessary for vs, could not come at vs, by reason the Bridge brake by the force of the water, which not three dayes before they had builded vp and erected.</P>
<P>The fourth of September, by the Sunne rising, the Emperour of Turkes, would needs in person be a beholder of the skirmish, and so in a manner ap∣proched the Campe of the Cossacks, bringing ma∣ny field Peeces, and mounting such, which they call <HI>Ianscharki,</HI> and so a great battaile began, which la∣sted full fiue houres: For the Cossacks much en∣damnified by the Artillary, made so braue a salley vpon the Turkes, that they draue them backe by maine force, and put a number of them to the sword, insomuch that they altered their determination, and brought their <HI>Ianskarks</HI> before the quarter, where the Camp-Master was lodged, but here it was too hot for them: and it did not succeed, as they expected, so they charged the Cossacks once againe, riding by our trenches in a brauing manner, and comming vp∣on them with an insulting violence, which yet pros∣pered not, as they expected: whereupon not an houre before Sunne setting, they charged them more violently, but God was our defence at this
<PB N="4" REF="4"/> time: For the Cossacks made so braue a salley, that they put the Turkes to flight euen to their Tents, with such a slaughter, and such a successe, that they surprised their Artillery, tooke many Tents, and ca∣ried with them much furniture, and so returned be∣fore dark night with the booty, to their own Camp and lodging.</P>
<P>The fift of December, we were quiet on both sides: For the Turkes remoued their quarter a little more backward, yet with full resolution to set vpon vs againe, as by many prisoners we tooke was con∣fessed: whereupon we fell to our accustomed pray∣ers to God, and about noone there fell a raine, and so there was nothing attempted that day, but that we prepared our selues for the expugnation.</P>
<P>The sixt of September, there fled vnto vs a Cos∣sack, one of the inhabitants by the riuer of Danu∣bius, who had beene seauen yeare in seruitude with the Turkes, and affirmed, that there were slaine 2000. Ianissaries in the last skirmishes, and expu∣puation of our Camp; that the great Turke him∣selfe would lead the whole Army in person, except such as he must needs leaue for the defence of his Camp, and the security of his cattell: that already there began to be a great dearth amongst them. For foure pound of bread was worth 24. Aspers of sil∣uer, and a quantity of Barly or other Corne, equal∣ling the halfe bushell of the measure of Camenensis, was valued at seauen Florins, and 15. Aspers, and that many discontents appeared amongst them al∣ready. The same day there came also vnto vs a
<PB N="5" REF="4"/> Dutch man, who had falne into the hands of the Turkes, as a prisoner with a Captaine of the Cos∣sacks, and he assured vs that on Friday <HI>Asis Bassaw,</HI> a man of great reputation among the Turkes, was struck in the forehead with a Bullet, and so slaine; and that so many Turkes were ouerthrowne in the last seuerall on-sets vpon the Cossacks, that they began to flye euery where from their quarter and Cabbines: he also related the cause, why the Turks were so quiet, which was by reason of a larges, or donation of money the Turke bestowed vpon such, who had behaued themselues well in the last enter∣prise, preparing for new assaults: and this was the truth of the matter.</P>
<P>The seauenth of September the Turkes came vp∣on vs againe in the after noone, and very outragi∣ously in great companies assaulted our Bulwarkes, which were yet vnperfected, and lay somewhat naked to opposition, ascending the same, and ta∣king as it were possession: but with equall losse, as it appeared for the time, vntill the noble Lord <HI>Steward</HI> of the Kingdome, who came there by chance with his troope of Horse, set vpon them most valiantly, and by the assistance of the Lord <HI>Castellano Plocen,</HI> and <HI>P. Radomina,</HI> put them off the walls to a fore-flight, as farre as the wood scited euen before the Turkes Campe, whether they fol∣lowed them in the slaughter: as for such Turkes as at first dared to approach our Trenches, and scale our Mounts, they all perished vpon them, we not loosing aboue twelue men of Armes in that
<PB N="6" REF="5"/> seruice, with some few other hurt, except <HI>Castella∣nus Plocen,</HI> who with many wounds returned, and died the next day: But the assault against the Cos∣sacks endured from noone to night; ours onely lasted from the after-noone to Sunne setting, yet both continued with so fearefull effects, that the multitude of the slaughtred was apparant, and the Enemies carkasses lay in heapes in the fields: Yea, it was remarkeable, how all that night the Turks made a search with lighted fire-brands, and other Lamps, for some person of account amongst the dead bodies, which as some of their owne fugi∣tiues affirmed, was one of the <HI>Viceer Bassas,</HI> who was missing, and could not be found.</P>
<P>The eighth of September, there escaped out of the Turkes hands a Cossack, who had long laine in fetters, he came to vs by night, and tolde vs plaine∣ly, that the Turkes had loaden many Cammels with the encumbrances of the Army, and furni∣shed the cariage Horses, as if they meant to make some retreat: notwithstanding, the same day very inconsiderately they came vpon the Cossacks a∣gaine, who by the helpe of the Germanes now a∣mongst them; both defended themselues, and of∣fended their Enemies: for here were braue Com∣maunders, partly vnder the Regiment and conduct of Captaine <HI>Drhusoff,</HI> partly vnder Captaine <HI>Ler∣mund,</HI> and of the other side in the right wing, there were the Cohorts of his Excellency, the Lord <HI>Palatine.</HI> The same day <HI>Schandactus</HI> cut off by the sword, according to the manner and custome
<PB N="7" REF="5"/> of a Military Court, who adiudged him to die, a principall Captaine of the Cossacks, called <HI>Bron∣danka,</HI> who the yeare before had abused his prero∣gatiue, and most peruersly by factious deuises, and apparant thefts, had transcended the gouernment of a Commaunder in chiefe, and falne to thefts and robberies more then necessity, or the present wants enforced.</P>
<P>The same day a certaine Squire escaped out of the hands of the Turkes, who was vnfortunately taken prisoner at a battaile in Cicora, and came vnto vs, affirming confidently, that since the Turkes comming into the field, there are dimini∣shed at least twelue thousand of their number, some slaine out-right, some dying of their woundes, some surprised in the Campe, and some flying away.</P>
<P>The ninth of September, the great Turke after noone drew out all his Army in battaile array: which Lord <HI>Magnus</HI> our Generall perceiuing, de∣tracted no time, but prepared for the fight: so that both Armies euen to Sunne setting, stood loo∣king vpon one another, without any mans giuing the signe of the battaile, not daring to approach too neere the fortifications, and Bulwarkes of our Tren∣ches; but stood as remote as they could, and far∣thest from danger. In the meane while, the Iani∣zaries fell foule vpon the quarter of the Cossacks againe, and continued little lesse then foure houres in a dangerous skirmish: For the Ger∣manes playing their part on the other side, as
<PB N="8" REF="6"/> assisting the Cossacks in their Warre-like excur∣sions, quickly, when they pressed them with fury and impetuosity, compelled them backe to their Campe, and wee returned to our Trenches: But the same night another prisoner escaped, and came vnto vs, affirming that of the Spahies, who were the forwardest in this expugnation, as so com∣maunded by the Captaine of the Ianizaries, lost two hundred of their Company, and of the Iani∣zaries were slaine, with such as perished in the flight 1500.</P>
<P>The tenth of September, the Turkes were some∣what quiet, as peraduenture wearied with the for∣mer dayes mischiefe, and we farre apparant the va∣rious chances of Warre, and the wonderfull essects of a Battaile.</P>
<P>The eleuenth of September, the Turkes made a new apparance out of their Tents, with a good∣ly Army: and wee were not behinde to Marshall our Companies to as braue a show: but nothing was done that day, and so wee returned on all sides to lodging: yet while wee remained in this expectation, the Turkes had transported their Ordnance to the other side of the Riuer, from whence hee played continually into the quarters of the Cossacks all that day: but when hee saw, they did them no more harme, hee quickly drew them backe againe; and placed them more se∣curely: The same day, some thousands of Tar∣tars shewed themselues on that side of the Riuer also; who with their accustomed clamours and
<PB N="9" REF="6"/> out-cry, attempted the breaking of our Bridge: but onely two hundred foot, whereof one was kil∣led, and two hurt with Bullet, pressed vpon them with such volleyes of shot, that they were quickly put to flight. God graunt wee may be thankfull for these things. For without controuersie, Gods onely hand hath protected vs, that both on the one side the Turke is more remisse then his former threatnings, and this present appearance promi∣sed; and we on the other side we haue had greater courages, and better successe then wee could any manner of way expect.</P>
<P>The twelfth of September, a little after mid∣night, wee determined to set vpon the Campe of our Aduersaries, leauing our noble Prince suffici∣ently guarded within the Trenches, as not well at ease, and so the Army deuided it selfe into parts, hauing instructions to come vpon them vnawares: the one to compasse the Woods, and set vpon them in the reare, and at their backes: the other to out-face them in the front and sides, that some∣thing might be done euery way. But it pleased God to send so great a shower of raine, that wee were diuerted from our purposes at this time: but I make no question of a better opportunity, and that our Aduersaries little knew of this pro∣iect, and so wee may once againe see the strata∣gem on foot, till when wee retired to our Tren∣ches securely.</P>
<P>The 15. of September, the Turkes and Tartars,
<PB N="10" REF="7"/> with a great resolution and impetuous assault, pres∣sed both vpon vs, and the Cossacks in three seuerall partes, neither fearing our Artillery, nor making accompt of our Trenches: the great Turke himselfe being a spectator on an eminent Hill, whose youth apprehended the mischiefe but as a sport. For with∣out any manner of remorce for the perishing of so many thousands, they came forward like furious beasts without Discipline or order, and so perished like Beasts, when the Artillery played vpon them, and wee rushed out as violently well armed and ap∣pointed in the smoake against them, this Battaile lasted from Noone to Night, and the God of Bat∣tailes for his mercy sake, did frustrate and annihilate both the purpose and the rage and fury of our Ene∣mies, nor ended it so, but for his Glories sake wee preuailed with a great slaughter, and little losse on our side: So that it should seeme all their threat∣ning and fury was in vaine, concerning the attemp∣ting of our Trenches, and the Angels of the Lord spred his winges ouer our Tents: On the other side our Souldiers were so couragious, and animated, as infused with new Spirits from the same God, that they not onely rushed out of the portes and passa∣ges of their Quarters vpon their Enemies, but hur∣ried ouer the Trenches and Ditches to forward the enterprise, and so came to handiblowes, and with extraordinary valour and slaughter sent them home againe.</P>
<P>In this Skirmish we did not altogether goe scot∣free, but saw the perishing of thousands of Turkes
<PB N="11" REF="7"/> and Tartars, whose Carkasses bespred the ground as it were: and among whome there perished the great Bashaw surnamed <HI>Koraken,</HI> who newly came to the Emperour and was most deare vnto him, and well accepted of him: the same Fate and triall had <HI>Nassan Bassaw</HI> with many Chawses and Spahies, and a number vnnumbred of common Souldiers.</P>
<P>After this slaughter the Turkes attempted no more the expugnation of our Campe, except that once they did inuade the quarter of the Cossacks, but with the like successe, yet many times they brought out their Armies to open view, and as ma∣ny times God of his mercy made way to our pre∣uailings, and wee returned Victors: The same day the Bridge was finished, which they had a while a∣goe begun ouer the Riuer, that diuided their Campes: but to what purpose is not knowne, ex∣cept to accommodate their passages the better: now also returned the Lord <HI>Siclentius,</HI> who had bin sent into the Palatinate of Moldauia with answer to a Letter, which they sent before, but what other newes he brought, is not apparant: It was also dis∣couered, that a rumour was spred into the Turkes campe, that the Sacred Maiesty of <HI>Sigismond</HI> the King our Master, was come into the Field with a Royall supply, and generall expedition, which a lit∣tle affrighted the Tartars, who were now to fight a∣gainst fortifications and Armed men, contrary to their barbarous custome of deuouring one another naked.</P>
<P>The 17. of September, our great Lord Generall
<PB N="12" REF="8"/> held a martiall Counsell with the Lord Senators, Dukes, Gouernors, and Captaines, to which were also called the Lord <HI>Sahaidace,</HI> Generall of the Cos∣sackes with all his Colonels, and Officers, who with one voyce, and vnanimity of Spirit concluded and agreed, rather to die manfully in the field, then to goe backe one foot of ground, to giue the Enemy cause of presumption: and this was done with such generall alacrity, that although both the Armies, I meane, the Polonians and Cossacks, were in great distresse and wants; yet they concluded, that by Gods grace, they would not be terrefied with any Enemy.</P>
<P>The 18. of September, certaine troopes of horse, and Companies of foot, made a salley out of the Cossacks quarter in the night vpon the Turkes Ar∣my, which was done so secretly and suddenly, that they ouer-turned many Tents, ransacked diuers Ca∣bins, and killed some hundreds of men with Iaue∣lings, Pollaxes, and Launces, without the report of a Peece, or carrying any Artillery with them: yea, herein they were so fortunate, that they returned with great spoile, without the losse of a man. The next night they performed as much, and with the like stratagem set vpon the Bridge they had newly builded &amp; erected, and slew <HI>Corkan Bassaw,</HI> to whose custody and charge it was committed. They also killed many Turks, tooke nine prisoners, and retur∣ned with great spoiles and a rich prey, wherein were diuers garments furred with costly Furres, which I thinke, the Turkes vse among the Tartars, who vpon
<PB N="13" REF="8"/> many excursions, made into Russia by thousand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in these dayes, returned with a wonderfull spoile, selling them at a price to the Turks: and this was done euen as they came along to take vp their lodgings in these Prouinces.</P>
<P>At this time his Excellency, the Lord Gene∣rall, was subiect to a great sicknesse, which so im∣paired his health, that he feared his life: where∣vpon he summoned all Officers, and referred his gouernment to the Lord <HI>Campe,</HI> Master Generall, with all Millitary priuiledges, and imperiall fun∣ctions, inuesting vpon him as farre as he could his dignity and authority; yet were the whole Army desirous to see the heroick Prince himselfe moun∣ted on horse-backe, as their Commaunder Ge∣nerall, though as yet very young, so that by this ioy and good mindes of the Army, he was much comforted, and incited to thanke them all, and be the more gracious vnto them, when time should serue.</P>
<P>The 24. of September, hauing layne quiet a great while, an accident at home disquieted vs all: For our great Lord Generall, labouring long in his sicknesse, and being wearied and spent a∣gaine with intollerable convulsions, and distem∣perature of the ayre, yeelded to the commaund of a higher Generall, and so died in the Camp.</P>
<P>The 25. of September, the Emperour of Turks made a great preperation to set vpon vs on all sides, drawing out from their seuerall Quarters,
<PB N="14" REF="9"/> both Horse, Foot, and Artillery, to oppresse and expugne vs with an vnresistable power; and so they approached our Trenches with accustomed clamours and out-cries: but the same God, that kept vs from the beginning, continued still our Protector, and all their attempts were annihila∣ted, turning rather to the destruction of many of their owne Souldiers, then to our detriment.</P>
<P>The 26. of September, <HI>Baptista</HI> was dispatched, who was sent vnto vs from the Palatine of Mol∣dauia, with Letters and other intelligence: hee came but the Tuesday before with the Lord of Zielenskij, who assured vs, that the Turkes had a great desire to treat of a peace; and therefore <HI>Baptista</HI> had in charge to deale with the Viceer, for safe conduct of such Commissioners, as might be sent to tractate about the peace and quietnesse of both Armies.</P>
<P>Within three dayes our Souldiers set vpon some part of the Tartars Quarter, as being much displeased, that the passages were stopped vp by them: whereby the Souldiers that went a forra∣ging, and to gather fodder and litter for their Horses, were much diappointed: so that in re∣uenge they put many to the sword, and set their Quarter on fire.</P>
<P>The 27. of September, the Turkes hauing strongly mounted diuers great Peeces, and pla∣ced their Gabbions about them, as is the custome, played fearefully into the Cossacks Quarter, and
<PB N="15" REF="9"/> spent all the fore-noone in the sending hundreds of Bullets among them: but when they percei∣ued that it smally auailed, they desisted, and made a new attempt in their owne persons neerer vnto them: which when the Cossacks perceiued, ei∣ther loath to be out-braued at their owne walls, as I may say, or encouraged by the thriuings of many out-roades and excursions they had for∣merly made: or emboldned by their owne suffi∣ciency, or presuming on the weaknesse, and na∣kednesse of their Aduersaries, I might adde their barbarous hastinesse, and bestiall howlings and out-cries; they sallyed out brauely, with the most part of their Army, and compulsed them backe, driuing them into their Quarters with a great slaughter, and a great speedinesse: and the same day, to the comfort of vs all, our noble Prince, whose long vntimely sicknesse, as it were, sadded our hearts, recouered some strength, ri∣ding round about the Army, being entertained with great showts and acclamations of the Soul∣diers, and shewing in himselfe apparant signes of recouery, as hauing layne vnder the shakings of a fearefull Ague, almost euer since wee encamped our selues, to whom the King did daily send Phy∣sicians, and Messengers, and would willingly haue come himselfe in person; but that all his Peeres and Counsailours would not hazard all at once, considering what a formidable Enemy had threatned him, and fearefull preperation in a man∣ner
<PB N="16" REF="10"/> circumcepted him: therefore they proiected to keepe him as a second, and that securely, that if the Turkes should preuaile (which God forbid) against these Forces well ordered and marshalled within these Trenches: there might yet a new Muster be made, and Army trayned, whom the presence of a King, and worthinesse of so great a Commander might bring together, and set vpon the Triumpher with fresh supplies.</P>
<P>But oh thou God! What an alteration was here? He that threatned these Polonians with in∣sulting ostentation, by Ambassies, Letters, and an innumerable company of Mahumetans and Tar∣tarians: he that had denounced defiance against all Christendome: he that had spoken presump∣tuous words against any force, should come by way of opposition: he that aduentured his person as farre as his greatnesse might descend, to be a Spectator of this wofull Tragedy, wherein the ministers of Warre and destruction must play their parts, and he which had brought one hun∣dred cast Peeces into the field, to batter all forti∣fications into rubbish: had now an answere re∣turned of strange contradiction, had now his threats retorted with as auaileable menaces, had now his rages sent backe againe with vnexpected fury, had now his presumption rebated with as noble a defiance, had now his way blocked vp and intercepted, that hee could not so quickly come ouer Pallisados, and Trenches, had now
<PB N="17" REF="10"/> Cannon to Cannon, battery to battery, and though not so many, as himselfe brought, yet so well ap∣pointed, and so efficatious in the designes, that hee was not so forward in his glory as he determined, nor so furious in any execution, as hee promised: Nay, if it had beene as well knowne to vs as him∣selfe, he repented that euer he came into the fields of Walachia, and as you shall heare hereafter, both retracted his first arrogancy, and whispered a peace, though hee durst not speake it aloud, for feare of the Ianizaries.</P>
<P>But oh you sonnes of men! what say you to ru∣mour, and the credulity of vncertaine reports? what say you to passion, and the disordered burstings out of your owne wishes? What say you to affrigh∣tings, that because you heare of the greater num∣bers, will therefore presently shew the greater par∣tiality? How often within this twelue moneth hath Bogdonia beene ransacked, Podolia distressed, Po∣lonia ouer-runne, <HI>Sigismond</HI> slaine, and the Army discomfited, and yet (thanks be to God) the trenches were neuer cast downe, the Souldiers disarmed, the troopes slaughtred, the King in danger: (For he was scarce in the field at all) or any fearefull losse endu∣red, more then they that must be lost in so many con∣flicts, and such impetuous assaults: and thus much by way of transition. Now to our businesse againe.</P>
<P>The same night, that the Prince had shewed him∣selfe, the day before the Cossacks being set vpon, as you haue heard, suddenly assaulted the Quarter of their enemies, especially the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who lay without
<PB N="18" REF="11"/> any manner of discipline, or strong fortifications: yea, this they did twice in one night, and that with such successe, that besides the slaughter, and hauock they made, they returned with great spoiles, and booty, yea greater then the Enemy could spare, or were willing to loose; this they did often, and al∣though sometimes their actions were obumbrated with some discomfiture: yet did they neuer make any salley, without the greater slaughter of their Enemies. Now is <HI>Baptista</HI> come backe againe from the Enemies Campe, bringing Letters from <HI>Vesin Bassha,</HI> of safe conduct and admission, as he himselfe had had experience by himselfe for such Commis∣sioners, as the King of Poland would put in trust for the dispatch of so high affaires: yea, he said plainly, as farre as he could coniecture, that neuer was any thing so pleasing to the Turke and his Souldiers, as the name of peace, considering the times, and the manner of the Warre; especially that his reputation was saued by the first seeking it by the Polonians: wherein he vsed this pollicy, to make the Ianizaries beleeue, he was of himselfe vnwilling to darken the glory of the Othoman family, by demanding peace himselfe at any inferiour Nation in the world.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all this motiue of quietnesse, which <HI>Baptistas</HI> Letters demonstrated, might come to equall conclusion by orderly Commissioners. The Grand Signieur proiected with all the force, brauery, and pollicy he could, to set vpon the Cos∣sacks againe, who were his Auncestors Enemies, and more obnoxious vnto him, then any neigh∣bours
<PB N="19" REF="11"/> whatsoeuer: and because he would make, as it were sure worke of the matter, hee acquainted <HI>Tartar Chrim,</HI> who they say accompanied him to the Warre with the same, and he either of necessity obeying, or out of custome consenting, or for his owne reuenges willing, quickly accord, and by breake of day brought all his Tartars to the place appointed for the expugnation: whereupon they ordered the matter so, that in the manner of a ring they compassed our Trenches round about: first playing ouer their heads into our Camps, with ma∣ny great Ordnance, which were mounted in three seuerall places; then transported they ouer the Ri∣uer thirty more, which continually beat both vpon ours, the Lissauonians, and the Cossacks Tents, and that for the space of diuers houres, sending likewise fiery Speares, burning Darts, and sulphury Balls a∣mongst vs, insomuch that our Prince lying yet sicke in his Tent, had the Captaine of his Guard slaine with a Bullet. Among the Lissauonians three of the best men of Armes were killed outright: and among the Cossacks one or two hurt.</P>
<P>After this, with strange assaults and fearefull vio∣lence, they pressed vpon the two speciall passages of our Camp: whereat the one stood firme, the Lord <HI>Campe</HI> Master Generall, with a great and strong Bat∣talion: at the other, the Lord <HI>Palatine Culmensis:</HI> in the Market-place, the Lord <HI>Doenhoff,</HI> with many Germanes: in a word, wee were all in Armes, and the Cannons played on both sides as farre as they could, for hurting those in their owne Quarters: at
<PB N="20" REF="12"/> last on a suddaine with accustomed cry the Tartars gaue on, and were ready to scale the Trenches &amp; en∣ter in at the Ports. Then followed the Ianizaries, as their seconds, and lastly, the Spahies and Chawses on Horsebacke, who by their brauery made them∣selues sure of the entrance, for the truth is we gaue ground, and lost many men: For they pressed so thicke vpon vs, that our shot did no good, and wee came to handy blowes within our owne Trenches, till certaine Cossacks on that quarter, and Masters of Pole on ours, finding the Tartars disordered and disarmed, rushed vpon them with fury, that they were driuen as fast back againe, as they came in, and in a manner bare the Ianizaries downe, and pusled them much with their violence: yet notwithstan∣standing fresh men were stil sent forwar, d who with a strange pertinacity, &amp; vnchangeable valour, con∣tinued till Sun-set in the expugnation: so that in my conscience, if they had beene Armed, and discipli∣ned after the manner of the warlike Nations of Eu∣rope, they had made a shrewde aduenture, and o∣pened a gap of entrance into our Countrey, and then (God knowes) whether this inundation would haue runne. For you see, when raging Seas beate vpon the bankes of low grounds, if they preuaile in bearing them before them, whole Countries are swallowed vp in the Vast paunch of the Ocean: But the same God, that puts a hooke in the nostrils of <HI>Leuiatham,</HI> and bindeth <HI>Bebemoth</HI> with a chayne, set a limitation for these raging Mahumetans, and furi∣ous and barbarous Tartarians, ouer which they
<PB N="21" REF="12"/> should not passe at this time.</P>
<P>For although they come with resolution to force our Trenches, and so to lay the way open to ouer∣looke those fieldes of Bogdonia with a curious eye, and put it thus to a braue tryall, diuiding them∣selues in many Troopes to take aduantage of our weaknes, and shrinking in this tempestuous storme, yet (God bethanked) with our accustomed constan∣cy we kept our ground, and though with some losse constrayned them to let goe the hold they had, and in the end with a great shame and a greater slaugh∣ter, they hid their heades within their owne hedges: yea, they that euer scorned to quarter themselues within Ditches, and for their infinite multitudes (with desire of expedition) would neuer consent to cast vp a Trench, were now compelled to thinke vpon security, and haue a retiring place to goe too as a refuge.</P>
<P>The 29. of September, there was great silence a∣mongst them, and a messenger came for intermissi∣on a while, that they might bury their Dead, which was a worke indeed reciprocall betweene vs, and so the time was spent in cleering the way of the dead Carkasses betweene our Campes, which being a full myle broad, lay all be-spred with dead bodyes, wherein we also had a share, and the same cause of setting ourselues on worke: For many Tartars had conuaied themselues ouer the Riuer, and taking ad∣uantage of our encounter, thought we had left the backside of our Campe, as it were naked and vnde∣fended, but when they came, they found the Carts,
<PB N="22" REF="13"/> Waggons, and Carriages, so strongly to Barricado it, that they thought it in vaine to hazard them∣selues, and so returned disappointed: yet because they would be doing, they threw wild-fire amongst the carriages, and put the Cattle in a great feare, whose roarings and bellowings amazed vs much, and in a manner begged reliefe at our hands, so that we thought it meete to send out certaine Troopes of Horse, who fell vpon them so opportunely, that they let in 200. Polaxes amongst them, yea the very Pyoners came with their Pixes and hutches, and played their parts like men and Souldiers: So that in the end wee compelled them to swim ouer the Riuer backe againe.</P>
<P>The next day being the 30. of September, certain fugitiues came vnto vs, and many Captiues of our owne Countrey-men, who assured vs that the Turkes lost in that Conflict 3000. men, besides those which the Tartars left behinde on the other side of the Riuer: wee lost outright besides the wounded 300. amongst whom was one Captaine of account, and two of the Princes Guard, who were well estee∣med by him: But such was the feare of this mis∣chiefe, and appearance of danger, that many indeed fled into <HI>Poland</HI> with heauy newes of an ouerthrow, so that when rumour was once a running, it immi∣tated a ball of Snow, which by often rowling grow∣eth greater and greater, and in the end consumeth like a Ball of snow, when the sunne of Truth dissol∣uech it into vapours, and consumeth it to nothing with the heate of his reflixure.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="13"/>
<P>The same day was a Councell of Warre, and when we saw, that their resolution was to ouer-run vs, and that if by any meanes we should fayle in op∣position, there would heere be made an entrance into our Country indeed, when we also vnderstood they were as willing to the peace as our selues, so it might bee of our first seeking, wee concluded to make the aduenture, and temper the potion, which might cure the burning feauer of our disquiet: and so the Lord <HI>Castellanus Belrenn,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Palati∣nadus Lublinnen,</HI> were appointed Commissioners to tractate with the Turkes about Articles of Peace, and cessation of Hostility: these had for their at∣tendants 20. of the best Gentlemen of our Campe, and the best furnished, besides seruants with proui∣sion of necessaries, if they should fayle in their Am∣bassie, and finde, a contrary doggednes in their enemies.</P>
<P>By that time the Trumpets had giuen warning of their accesse, and that they approched very neere the Turkes Campe 200. Spahies and Chawses on Horsebacke with Veluet Gownes, rich siluer Ma∣ces, and braue Turbanes, came to entertaine them, and bring them by way of conduction through the first Guard of Ianizaries, and so through many troopes of Horse, and field Pieces mounted on de∣licate Carriages, till they came to the Tent of the Viceer, who welcommed him in his Masters be∣halfe: but according to former custome hee must at∣tend a while, ere hee could haue Answer from the <HI>Grand Signeur</HI> himselfe, and peraduenture not speake
<PB N="25" REF="14" MS="y"/> with him at all: For you must know, that howe∣uer they were glad of composition, yet the Turke would not discouer any inclination to Peace, but if hee did condiscend, it was meerly out of Heroyick compassion, not any necessity of his part: For du∣ring the time of the treaty, the Hostility continued, and diuers excursions had the effect of furious en∣counters and bloody skirmishes.</P>
<P>The first of October, the Lord <HI>Koskakorffskij</HI> re∣turned by night with all his Company and prouisi∣on safe to our Campe, hauing escaped many dan∣gers and conflicts with the Tartars, who being ac∣quainted with this purpose and Iourney, lay in waite to intercept his returne: For thus it was, prouision fayling in our Campe, and many necessaries wan∣ting because the Enemy had blocked vp diuers pas∣sages and Riuers, whereby the inhabitants could not bring in prouision, as they were accustomed, it was concluded to send the Lord <HI>Koskakorffskij</HI> with Captaine <HI>Visnen</HI> to the Towne Camenecen, with a sufficient conuoy for prouision and victuall; who some 8. dayes before tooke his Iourney, which was not yet so couertly done, but both Turkes &amp; Tartars were acquainted with the same, apprehending that we must needs be in some distresse, &amp; that our wants were to bee supplyed from his endeauours in procu∣ring new prouision, and therfore aduanced a strong Battalion with many shot on foote, and diuers field Pieces to intercept his returne, and so lay betweene the Towne and our Campe, being not 15. nayle a sunder: they tooke vp much ground, and were
<PB N="26" REF="14" MS="y"/> dispersed in many places, yea many times resolued to set vpon the Towne it selfe, and if they could to take the spoyle of the same but it was too strong for them, and so they contented themselues in the expectation of this booty, and the returne of the Polonians to the Campe.</P>
<P>When the Towne sawe the Fieldes thus ouer∣spred with Tartars, and that they were so well ap∣pointed to intercept the Carriages, they fortefied themselues the stronger, and yet ment not to keepe themselues within their Walles, considering the necessity of releeuing their Campe: but againe vn∣derstanding that they lay vpon euery passage, and must hazard the whole Conuoy with the prouisi∣on in the interception: the Lord <HI>Koskakorffskij,</HI> with the other Captaines, thought it best to put a tricke vpon their Enemies, and deceiue them if they could by a petty Stratagem, which they thus effect∣ed: When all thinges were ready for their returne within Eight dayes after their departure from the Campe, they set forward backe againe, with many Waggons of Wine and Corne, and so issued out with certaine Troopes well appointed, whom they flancked with light Waggons full of Strawe, and Hay, yet not so full but they went in a manner as fast as the Horse, which when the Tartars percei∣ued, they brought vp their Pieces and came for∣ward with their shot, to dis-rancke these Cartes, ve∣rily supposing the maine booty was in the midst of the troopes: but the Cartes went so fast, and the Horse vpon the trot, that they were quickly from
<PB N="26" REF="15"/> the shot of their Ordinance, and made the Tartars weary to follow them: yet as they were instructed they made diuers stands, as if the Waggons ment to take some rest, and then as the Tartars approa∣ched they would trot away againe, and thus they continued till night: by which time the Tartars were quickly drawne from the Towne, and thought it worke enough to secure the field Peeces from surprizing: When night came, then issued out the Lord <HI>Koskakorffskij</HI> with the mayne Conuoy indeed, which consisted of Corne, Oyle, Wine, Honey, and Cattle, and went a cleane contrary way vnknowne to the Enemy, though somewhat about to a Towne called <HI>Sarno Kouonicie,</HI> where he was ac∣cōmodated to the Riuer of <HI>Ister,</HI> and from whence he came to the Campe, as you haue heard in safety and good order: yet not without some oppositi∣on, though farre from losse and discomfiture: For by that time the Tartars knew how they were de∣ceiued, which they did by light Horsemen sent of purpose by the Polonians, to diuert them from fol∣lowing those troopes that issued out of <HI>Cameneces</HI> by day too farre, they sent word to the Turkes of the deceipt, and they exasperated with very rage, ranne downe in whole Companies to beset the Ri∣uer on both sides, and brought their Ordinance to play vpon the Boates, who kept the streame, but the most were passed by ere they came; and the rest kept the Channell, which was heere so broad, that the Ordinance played on the Banckes and could not doe them much harme: Yet did the Turkes
<PB N="27" REF="15"/> follow them as farre as our Trenches, but we hauing certaine Towers well fortefied on both sides the Riuer, played out of them so violently, that wee cut off some of them in their speedines, and those who were within reach of the shot of our Trenches, were faine to recoyle, and so the Turkes and Tartars re∣turned with great sorrow on all sides, to be thus dis∣appointed, and we entertained our friends with ioy on euery side to be thus releeued.</P>
<P>The same day before Sun-setting, Ambassadors came to our Noble Prince from the Cossackes, in∣habiting the shore of the Blacke sea by the mouth of Volga, and those Riuers that powre themselues as it were into the lap of <HI>Moeotis Palus,</HI> and those borders of Russia: The somme of their Ambascy was, that they had raised an Army of 20000. in de∣fence of the Christians, against either Turke and Tartar, or any other Enemy, which shall blaspheme their Religion; they were armed and payed and within a dayes march of the Campe: whether they were entertained by the Prince or no? Let all Prin∣ces iudge, who know the benefit of Auxiliary forces and friendly supplyes, comming opportunely, and in case of necessity, whether the newes was wel∣come? let a wounded and distressed person iudge who is puld out of a ditch from staruing &amp; brought to good fires and better lodging: whether we made vse of their company and coadiutement, let him iudge, that being ouermatched with raging aduer∣saries, is on a sodain supplyed with worthy seconds, who venture their liues in his defence: In a worde worde whether the Turkes vnderstanding of their
<PB N="28" REF="16"/> approach: were not a little troubled, considering they had beene so often affronted already: let them judge that vnderstand the nature of Conflicts, and the condition of supplies, though it bee but in Ambuscadoes, which haue many times turned backe, fayling and discomfitted Troopes, and in a new tryall recouered the victory.</P>
<P>word whether the Turks vnderstanding of their</P>
<P>The second of October, wee tooke some Priso∣ners, and many came vnto vs of their owne accord; yea, diuers Captiues Christians found away to escape, and deliuer themselues from the Turkish slauery and bondage, and bee vnited againe to the Loue and Obedience of their mother Countrey, who all confidently affirmed, that the Turkes were weary of the Warre, and the Tartars cryed out of the walled Townes, fortefied Trenches, mounted Ordinance, arming Corslets, long Pikes, and o∣ther Warlike preparation, contrary to their bar∣barous and Sauage nakednesse, and yet did they not desist from their spoyles, and vnciuill forra∣ging of the Countrey, especially if they could vp∣on any aduantage, either set vpon vs, or surprise vs: but yet wee had no such aduertisement from our Commissioners, nor durst disbandy our selues vpon any hopes, whatsoeuer: Onely this I will bee bolde to affirme, that if the Turkes did now desire a Peace with vs, hee will not bee so forward to proclaime Warre against vs hereafter, or in∣frindge the Conditions, when they bee once ra∣tified.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="16"/>
<P>From the third of October, to the ninth, the time was spent in disputing about the peace: For the Hospodar of Walachia, with many Princes of Ser∣uia and Bulgaria, intruded themselues, and desired the Viceers and Bashawes of the Turke to be inclu∣ded in the conditions. Heere some will haue the King of Poland to repaire into the Campe: some againe will haue him to come in with the Army of Cossacks, that came from Volga and the black Sea: some will haue his Standard royall to be aduanced in the Army, before he came in person: some will haue him secretly to come in, without any brauery or ostentation: howsoeuer it be; this is sure, that he was neither mentioned, nor publickly seene, vntill the Treaty of Peace, and his marching to Leopolis, wherein likewise I finde some discrepancy about the time, which may be the mistaking of <HI>stilo nouo,</HI> and <HI>stilo antiquo,</HI> or else the error consisted in the setting downe a generall rising, when yet most part of the Army remained in the Trenches, after the King was departed, as you shall heare hereafter: howsoeuer; I finde no variation for the substance of matter, nor in truth any great matter after the peace to variate about, and so to the purpose.</P>
<P>The ninth of October, the peace was concluded after the old conditions, and ratifications with the accustomed manner of proceedings, nor was there any manner of foederation left out, which might serue to glorifie the Common-wealthes on either side: From whence I onely obserue, that by this meanes, this insulting Enemy, who a little before,
<PB N="30" REF="17"/> or if you will the Spring of the yeare, threatned fire and sword, and was so farre from any conditions of amity, that he proclaimed the deuastation of our Countrey, and would haue no deniall, but vtter sub∣iection, tribute, and slauish obedience, by the force of Armes, saw now the staffe of his mightinesse bro∣ken a pieces; and that in a manner by compulsion, he must make a peace with an inferiour Prince: and when? when we stood in need of prouision, wanted powder, and shot, saw a returdance in such troopes and payments of money, as were promised by many Christian Princes, had our Common-wealth tur∣moyled with the Warres of Liuonia, and our selues formerly wearied with many convulsions, now set vpon afresh with the onely Enemies of Christen∣dome, the great Turke, and barbarous Tartar: but this God can doe, and this God for vs, and the same God will (I hope) continue his mercy toward vs.</P>
<P>The 11. of October, the Emperour of Turks sent vnto his Maiesty a Messenger with these instructi∣ons, that we should first raise our Camp, and depart out of Walachia, a Prouince subiect and tributary to him, which by no meane<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we would agree vnto, proiecting altogether the dignity of the Kingdome, and the commodiousnesse of the Army, both which might haue beene impaired, nay all quite ouer∣throwne, if while we were pusled thus in rising; ei∣ther the Turks breaking their couenants, might fall vpon vs; or ouer-taking vs in the Plaines, might presse vpon vs with the greater number, and vn∣prouided. Whereupon the Turke leauing the
<PB N="31" REF="17"/> standing Bridge, which he made ouer the Riuer, re∣moued his Camp some halfe mile backwarder, gi∣uing vs leaue to make vse of the Bridge, either for carriages too and fro, or our orderly marches: but yet we stirred not for all this: no, though the Turke stayed two dayes in that place; insomuch, that wee had recourse one to another, and tooke a liberty to flatter one another with formall welcomes, feasting, and kinde embraces, as is the custome of reconciled friends, or if you will protected Enemies.</P>
<P>The 12. of October, the Grand Signieur marched fiue mile further, to the Riuer surnamed Prath, and there settled his whole Army: The same day we dis∣posed of our Ordnance in Carts made of purpose, and tooke the benefit of the Turkes Bridge, for the easier accommodating our selues, as you haue heard: yet was our King on foot, and had marched some few dayes before toward Leopolis, giuing vs dire∣ctions not to stirre, till the time appointed: For the Tartars were not yet appeased, but continued their accustomed manner of thefts and robberies, both in burning of Villages, and meeting with as naked men as themselues; so that when we departed indeed, we went very strong, sending our Munition and Caria∣ges, two dayes before we threw downe our Tren∣ches; where-about, also there was some disputing, whether we should leuell them with the ground or no: for they seemed a good refuge, if occasion ser∣ued to retire vnto.</P>
<P>The 13. of October, the Turkes remoued againe a little beyond the Riuer of Prath, and encamped
<PB N="32" REF="18"/> themselues three mile further. The same day our il∣lustrious Prince continuing still with the maine Ar∣my, arose at once, and marched to the further side of Ister ouer the Turkes Bridge, by a Towne called Zaranie, in the Prouince of Checinen, and in the field that belonged to the Castle, where the Prince tooke vp his lodging, leauing the Lord <HI>Lermunth,</HI> and all the Germane Coherts to attend the Caria∣ges and Carts, and safe conduct the Artillery to the places appointed: For there were many straglers of the Tartars, and Out-lopers of the Seruians and Walachians, that lay in waite for robberies, and spoiles, neither sparing vs, nor the Turkes them∣selues, if they could ouer-master either, and so were no better then professed Theeues: and therefore was this order taken in our marches, not to be cir∣cumuented, or made a spoile of in the breaking vp of a Campe.</P>
<P>All the next day, being the 14. of October, we ta∣ried at Zaranie, till the Cariages came together, which the day following, being the 15. we sent very early to Camenicen, whether wee also approched with the maine Troopes by Sunne set. But the Cossacks tooke another way, hauing many promi∣ses of gratification, both from the Turke and our selues, such was their valour, deseruing commemo∣ration: such were their enterprises compelling ac∣knowledgement. That night the Prince lodged in the Castle: and the next day the Commissioners returned with the Articles of agreement, and ma∣ny Honourable persons presented themselues, who
<PB N="33" REF="18"/> were seuerally welcommed as Actors on the former stage of Warre, and turmoile, and louers of their Countrey, for whose sakes, as you haue heard, they aduentured both estates and persons, and were rea∣dy to powre out their bloods, as they named it, for the crosse of Christ.</P>
<P>After the serious matters were debated, the Am∣bassadours dismissed, and the affaires settled, they had some time to talk of other busines, and amongst the rest of the Turkes disposition, concerning whom one of the Basshawes had discouered to the Polonians, while they were about their tractate of peace: how irkesome and distasting it was to the young Emperour, who many times in a franticke manner would excruciate and torment himselfe with actions of distemperature, as throwing of his Turbane, beating his breast, and kicking his very Basshawes, who durst not reply, but were subiect to a very slauish prostitution, and then would he fall to weeping, and wringing his hands to thinke vpon his inauspitious actions, and vnfortunate attempts, remembring two especiall times: one when with seauen thousand of our Army, we set vpon 10000. Turkes, who made a braue salley on our Trenches, but were beaten backe with violence to their owne homes, at which he so stormed, that he called them Slaues, Vagabonds, and idle; as if they had played the Traytors of purpose to ecclipse his glory, and obumbrate his renowne.</P>
<P>Another: when the Cossacks sallyed vpon them, and slew so many of the Tartars, that they were
<PB N="34" REF="19"/> weary of killing, and so returned with a great prey and spoile into their owne quarters. But of all that fatall day, the 18. of September troubled and tor∣mented him, when he resolued and set vp his rest to ouer-runne vs at once, and came forward with such impetuosity, that we feared our selues, had not God fought for vs, and turned them backe with a great slaughter: yea, such was our losse, and the doubt∣fulnesse of the victory, that all Europe rang with our ouerthrow: and in Hungary it was reported, how he was come as farre as Sendomiria and Cra∣couia; but (God be thanked) it fell out otherwise, and as now the tale is told, a strange accident affirgh∣ted them all, which we knew not then, nor doe we now presume vpon, either as our deseruing, or cause of preseruation.</P>
<P>The same day, an Earthquake chaunced in the Turkes Camp, in such a fearefull and palpable man∣ner, that the whole Army ranne out of their Tents, leauing the Emperour with some certaine Cham∣berers and Ianizaries alone in his: who on a sud∣daine demaunded; what was become of his Army? to whom it was answered, That part were gone vp∣on a Camisado on the Polonians, and part were ranne out as amazed at the Earthquake. And part, now the curse of <HI>Mahomet</HI> part them, said he: What doe I here to be a scorne to you all, and a derision to posterity? With that he snatched at a Semiter, and whether he meant to strike at them, or dispatch him∣selfe, they could not tell. But thus preuented, hee fell groueling on the ground, and vp againe with a
<PB N="35" REF="19"/> distempred countenance, and wringing his hands: wherein his distemperature moued commiseration, and they all stood amazed to see 14. yeares so appre∣hensiue to distinguish betweene glory and shame: but were confounded altogether to heare him vtter these words, and vent out a passion in such an he∣roick manner.</P>
<P>Oh God! that hast giuen vs bread, and enlarged our Empire with the territories of Iewes, Christi∣ans, and Kingdomes beside? that hast made the house of <HI>Othoman</HI> a scourge and terrour to all Na∣tions, and enlarged our renowne before any Prince vnder the Sunne: that hast giuen vs a Prophet, and a Law, whereby our Alcharon is without opposi∣tion: that hast made our <HI>sacra porta</HI> a wonder in na∣ture, and aduanced our great Citty on a hill of emi∣nency, that the Nations may call <HI>Stanbole</HI> beau∣tifull, and come from a farre to behold our <HI>Seralio.</HI> But what shall become of all this? Shall my youth, temerity, cowardize, or misfortune, adde a fatall pe∣riod to this glory, or all my Auncestors victories wrapped vp in the Cipres chests of my destiny, and ominous proceedings? Shall all these Kingdoms re∣sume a new courage of reuolting, as if the Mahume∣tane Empire were now at the highest, and my disa∣strous childishnesse the discouerer of the secret? Shall <HI>Othomans</HI> ashes be metamorphozed into some horrid shape, to exprobrate my pufillanimity, and tell me to my face, I am more worthy of a rod then a Scepter? Shall <HI>Mahomet</HI> come from Paradise, and assure me, the gates shal be in the in the inside against
<PB N="36" REF="20"/> me, for abusing the trust committed to me, and play∣ing the suckling, when I was to fight his battailes in the field! Oh what an excruciation is this? Haue all my Predicessors done something in the world as an addition of honour, and enlargement of their fame, saue onely my selfe, who am now so farre from do∣ing of any thing worthy the least report; that in steed of memorable actions and heroick attempts, I must returne with shame and discomfiture: nay, as they tell me, make a peace with a petty Prince and Prouince, when my Predicessours neuer pitched their Tents, nor aduanced the Standarts of our Cressant: but had all the Princes of Europe with the wings of the winde, to flye in their faces, and yet to no purpose. And now, and now: am I borne to shame and confusion? Oh God! Oh <HI>Mahomet,</HI> shall it be thus?</P>
<P>To this, or the like purpose was that day spent by the young Prince, till at last, as you see the vpper streames of a Riuer follow one another, mischiefe att<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nded mischiefe, and the cries of wounded men assured him, there was newes of another slaughter to torment him; then grew he so mad indeed, that no body durst come in his sight, had not the Musty and some Doctors of the Law leuiated this phrenzie with honest discourse; and from example, made a Cataplasme as it were for his sore: telling him the story of <HI>Baiazet,</HI> whom <HI>Tamberlaine</HI> bound in chains, and of <HI>Soliman</HI> the magnificent, who after many glo∣rious victories, saw the malice of a woman to de∣stroy his sonne <HI>Mustapha,</HI> and the rest of his family:
<PB N="37" REF="20"/> and of many others who had as great touches of grieuances as men were were subiect vnto, &amp; either beare them out brauely with the scorne of disquiet, or recouered their renownes with a new industry, that was shrinking frō them, by giuing way to feare or impatience: and therefore it is wisedome and magnanimity to put in practise the best examples, and of all other things to yeeld to opportunity, as for the peace now to be considered on: There was no disparagement to his Honour, and the greatest Monarchs in the world haue yeelded to necessity in such constraints. Againe, Fortune was not alwayes disposed to be waaton, nor would at all times attend the chariot of Warre: therefore it was best yeelding a little to time, especially now, when warlike Nati∣ons had learned this discipline, to enclose an Army within Trenches, and Pallisadoes, that durst not en∣dure the fury of a battail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, nor the violence of such forces, as were sure to make their way in the open fields. Besides, experience had discouered this secret, that a well fortified Towne was now longer a win∣ning and battering, then a whole Prouince in times past in ouer-running and conquering.</P>
<P>In this manner, they pacified the young Prince, and prepared him against all manner of ominous ac∣cidents: so that when the Treaty of Peace came in deed, the Commissioners proceeded, as you haue heard, and not onely e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fected that, which they went for: but returned with sufficient reward, and equall acceptation, relating the matter as it chanced, and certifying our Prince with the whole discourse,
<PB N="38" REF="21"/> while he was resident at Camenices.</P>
<P>Thus far gentle Reader, hath one Letter brought me, and the businesse, which being in a high Latine phrase, and a Polish Character doth warrant, it came from some Gentleman of quality, or Souldier of ac∣count, or both in one man, who was sure an actor in the same: and heerein I haue not failed in any sub∣stance of matter, except in some circumstance of time, or Ortography of proper names, mistaking a Z for an L, or an s for an r, with such like, &amp;c. which such, as know the Countrey, may easely mend; and such as know not, may yet vnderstand the truth of the businesse, without taking exceptions at the ac∣cent of proper places, onely I must confesse I finde not the word <HI>Rex</HI> in all the Letter, but at the latter end: onely <HI>illusrissimus Princeps</HI> is often named, which whether it meane the Father or Sonne, I leaue it to him that can iudge by the coherence of the sen∣tences, and application of the diuisions: what is done, is meerely for thy satisfaction; and what is to be done, will afford you the like pleasure: For in both, you may see the mercy of a great God, and the vanity of a presumptuous man: the one can pull downe the proud, and aduance the humble and weake: the other must confesse the changes of mor∣tality, &amp; alteration of humane condition: or knock his knees together with feare and trembling, when with <HI>Belshasher</HI> he sees the hand writing on the wall. Thus did the Assirian Monarch banquet in the bounds of the Sanctuary, and that in security, when yet the same night the Medes and Persians besieged
<PB N="39" REF="21"/> Babylon, and hee was betrayed into his Enemies hands with the losse of his life, and Kingdome. And thus did the great Turke threaten Poland, as hoping thereby to make a way into Europe, and the Nor∣therne Seas, when yet within three moneths he was vtterly disappointed, and compelled to entertaine a Peace, when in a youthfull iollity his heart scorned to entertaine any thing but reuenge or ambitious designes. Now the God of all blessings make vs thankfull for so great a mercy, that his benefits be not bestowed in vaine, nor wee the sonnes of men more stupid and ingratefull, then the bruit beasts, that acknowledge his kindnesse, and euerlasting goodnesse.</P>
<P>I haue also (gentle Reader) another Letter for thee, which depends immediatly vpon the former, sorting in euery thing to the truth: but that I finde a little discrepancy in the rising of the Camp, which either may be mistaken by the difference of <HI>stilo no∣uo,</HI> and <HI>antiquo,</HI> or by the Kings going to Leopolis, before the maine Camps brake vp, and the Tartars were absolutely appeaz'd, or drawne away by the Grand Signieur. I finde it translated to my hand, and written from Leopolis to some man of Honour else where: but it hath neither date, nor superscrip∣tion: no, nor the Author hath subscribed his name; at which I doe not wonder, because it is but a Copy, nor would haue thee wonder: For it is a common thing in Letters of newes and occurrences, wherein all men would be glad to participate their secrets for the common good, but not publish the Authors for
<PB N="40" REF="22"/> feare of priuate traducing: you shall haue it there∣fore, as I finde it; and when you haue read it, then iudge whether it be worth the publishing or no. It thus begins.</P>

<HEAD>The Copie of a Letter written from LEOPOLIS.</HEAD>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gracious and Honourable Lord:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE fourth of October, wee departed from Lublinn, from whence I signified the present Occurrents, and hauing now exposed our selues to a new iourney, we likewise a-new disposed the order of our marches: For although the peace was concluded, yet the tydings of the Tartars and Valachians approches encreased, who being not withdrawne out of the field, would not withdraw themselues from their beastly manner of spoiles, robberies, rapes, and cruelty: Wherefore to pre∣uent their reuenges, and secure our selues, the Troopes were thus marshalled. First, certaine Cor∣nets of Horse-men, and Scowt-Masters were sent out; then the Vantguard with a Battalion on foot: then the Kings Maiestie with his houshold-seruants, and the Banner impressed the Armes royall; to wit, a white Eagle with a white crosse diuided, and vp∣on the same <HI>tecum et pro te.</HI> This Ensigne consisting of fiue hundred, was gathered at the charges of vo∣luntary
<PB N="41" REF="22"/> Courtiers, and by them exquisitely set out and ordered. After these, immediately followed the Kings Maiestie, with a Troope of three hun∣dred Dutch Horse, being his Guard: then came such Carriages as belonged to the King, and then such as belonged to the Souldiers: And last of all followed the reare, which consisted most of Masters of Pole. The sixth day wee came to Zamoschia, where there adhaered vnto vs about sixe thousand Dutch Horse-men, whose Colonell was the Pala∣tine of Marcinburg, and sixe thousand Foot vnder the conduct of Colonell <HI>Arnhem:</HI> so that thus strengthened, we marched with greater safety, yet not altogether without perill, vntill wee came to Leopolis. For on the one side we saw the Country on fire, a most certaine Character of the Tartars im∣pression, who burned all before them, and we had now attained vnto their ashes: on the other side, wee might easely see many stragling Seruians, and Bulgarians, who as the Tartars delighted in no∣thing, but vniustifiable Robberies, in which manner for all the Turkes proclamation they continued, till they were quite retired home.</P>
<P>The 8. of October, we lodged all night in a little Towne, which had been burnt by the Tartars cal∣led <HI>Podlitez,</HI> and from thence determined the next day to go forward: but feare ceased vpon the Vaunt∣gard, by reason the Scowts returned with newes, that our Wagons were surprized, and the noyse went, they were ransackt by the Tartars: but thankes be to God, it proued a false Alarum: onely some 4000.
<PB N="42" REF="23"/> Tartars, and other of those Nations appeared with a warlike countenance, and might haue been suspec∣ted to take aduantage of our straglers: but seeing vs so strong, and so well ordered, they gaue vs leaue to goe forward, and we left them to their sauage and vnnaturall immanity.</P>
<P>The day following, a Councell was called in a little Towne called Kimerton, and for as much as the maine body of the Tartars Army, was but three mile distant from vs, and that hauing done so well all this while, wee would be loath to make a shuffling end at the parting: we there encamped our selues, and aboad a whole day, and then taking the neigh∣bouring people into our custody, we marched for∣ward toward Leopolis, and hauing the twelfth of October gayned the sight of the City, euery man was cheared, and solemnly praised God for their former deliuerance. There came forth many of the Gentility to salute and receiue the King: and after them followed multitudes of people: an old cu∣stome to applaud the action of Conquerors, or wel∣come such Princes, who else would be their owne caruers. It was verily woorth the seeing: For the King neuer rode with such pompe and confluence into any City; and because it was remarkable, and worthy of memory, I will hereafter compile it into a larger discourse, and send it your Honour. In the meane time, to satisfie those that desire to know the present estate of our affaires, I will briefly make a summary collection, and intimate our deliuerances, as they chanced.</P>
<PB N="43" REF="23"/>
<P>Beyond all expectation a saluation is befalne vs: For wee are released from the extreamest perill whereinto wee were falne, not by our owne dili∣gence and power, but by the speciall prouidence of God, who hath done great wonders for vs. Behold our matters were at the point of losse, our Souldi∣ers being wearied and tyred with Turkish assaults: our powder and Munition failed our people, tasted of hunger and and wants. <HI>Kotkouite</HI> Palatine of the Wilde, and Generall of the Army died in the Campe: our Prince fell sicke and sadded our hearts, and many other inconueniences besides the slaugh∣ters of our men, threatned our ruine, and vtter sub∣uersion. But behold on a suddaine how comfort ap∣peared: about the 2. of October a treaty of Peace was offered, and accepted by the Turke, for which purpose wee were contented to depute certaine Commissioners, who were accordingly entertained and admitted into the Turkes Campe, to wit the Castellan of <HI>Belsens,</HI> and the Palatine of <HI>Lublines,</HI> who went roundly to worke, but after the Turkish manner they stood vpon high tearmes of ostentati∣on, vntill some, who stood in Tractalion with them, mittigated the heauy imposed conditions, which continued vntill the 8. of October. In fine, the next day I know not by what speciall working of God, the Turke casting a side all the propounded Condi∣tions, and interiected cauils, accepted the <HI>Pacta an∣tiqua,</HI> which also was on both sides confirmed and ratefied: Then were our Commissioners admitted to the Emperours presence, and kindely receiued
<PB N="44" REF="24"/> and honoured with guiftes.</P>
<P>He also sent vnto the Illustrious Prince <HI>Vladislaus,</HI> a liuing Elephant with many other thinges, who a∣gaine regratulated him with Dogs, and certaine payres of hand Guns, made in the Low-Countries, and so the Peace was published, and the Articles brought to the King to <HI>Leopolis,</HI> the Campe remai∣ning yet firme, and the Cossackes continuing in their quarters.</P>
<P>At last the Turke retired his Army, and diuerted the Tartars, who all this while spoyled and burned the Countrey, hee also promised great guifts to the Cossackes, which should heereafter be sent by Le∣gations, and whatsoeuer was equally demaunded, was on the Turkes part most Princely graunted; all which points considered, maketh this matter al∣most incredible: For the like is not found in the Turkish Histories, and in especiall, that the Empe∣rour in person being in an expedition of such pre∣paration, should condiscend to such Articles of Peace, and be contented to returne home frustrated and disappoined.</P>
<P>But these bee Gods secrets to preserue vs, to the end that Christendome should not by our ouer∣throw, bee further infested with Turkish Armies. For questionles if wee had fayled either in our Campe, or incounters, hee had passed without con∣trole, and the plaint Countrey would quickly haue beene ouer-runne by their multitudes, and outragi∣ous Tartars who thought vpon nothing but ruine and destruction: what should I insist more vpon
<PB N="45" REF="24"/> this matter? great Peace hath imbraced vs, and comfort lighted vpon our heades vnlookt for: Our Campe shall be broken vp, and we dayly expect the Turkes Legate, for whom me Illustrious Prince <HI>Vla∣dislaus</HI> tarries, we as suppose to conduct him to the King, who will abide 8. dayes at <HI>Leopolis</HI> to giue or∣der for the discharge of the Souldiers, and setling of other matters behoofefull, partly for these Pro∣uinces, partly for the good of Moldauia, and Podo∣lia, with those of Bogdonia, who are all included in the Articles.</P>
<P>After the dispatch of these affaires, the King in∣tendeth to returne to Warsaw, as receiuing Letters out of Sweden, which are not altogether pleasing vnto him: In the meane while the Gentlemen and Masters are dismissed, and many Souldiers, who are yet in the expedition haue order to returne, and a generall Commaundement is gone out to haue Prayers and Processions in euery Church, yea I am sure by to that time the newes came Cracow, and o∣ther Citties, they will not spare for Bonfiers, and make a generall reioycing in euery place.</P>
<P>I know that these thinges will bee acceptable ti∣dings to your Honour, the euent of other causes I will hereafter, signifie. Send the Conditions of the Peace, or if you will the Articles of agreement, and diligently write what else shall bee worth the relating, as I encounter with such, as come out of the Campe: All I desire now is, that this my dili∣gence may bee commended, and dedicated vnto
<PB N="26" REF="25" MS="y"/> your gracious fauour: I am promised a discourse of the departure of the Tartars, and how they tooke their leaues of the <HI>Gran Seigneurs,</HI> when it comes it shall salute you with speed, in the meane while Gracious Lord, if I rest in your Fauour, I haue my desire.</P>

<HEAD>CONDITIONS OF Peace, betwixt the Emperour of the Turkes, and his Majesty of Poland, <HI>Sul. Dato</HI> 9.th of October, 1621. <HI>Stilo Nouo.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. INprimis, <HI>Stanislaw Salishowskis Secretarius Re∣gius,</HI> shall <HI>ex nunc</HI> goe with the Turkish Em∣perour vnto <HI>Constantinople,</HI> there to attend the comming of a great Ambassador, which the Kings Majesty shall send, and the said Ambassador shall alwayes remaine at the <HI>Sacra Porta,</HI> like the Ambassa∣dors of other Christian Potentates: and in this re∣spect a principall Chawse shall presently be dispat∣ched to goe with our Commissioners vnto his Ma∣iesty, and a great Turkish Ambassador follow, to the end that <HI>Pacta antiqua abvtra{que} parte,</HI> which are all recorded, may bee sworne vnto, confirmed, and ratefied.</P>
<P N="2">2. To the end that the Cossacks may not hence∣forth damnifie the Turkish Empire: both sides bind
<PB N="27" REF="25" MS="y"/> themselues to preuent the same: and so oft as the Turkish Emperour in this respect shall haue cause to require the administration of Iustice, the Kings Maiesty shall bee obliged to performe the same. In which respect the Tartars likewise shall abstaine from all manner of hostile inuasions against the Kingdome, as in more especiall the Turkish Empe∣rour hath vndertaken to hinder their passage at <HI>Och∣kora,</HI> and if beyond expectation either part shall be damnified, by the other restitution shall be made, and the Tartars punished: but in the Vast and vn∣deuided Wildernesse, vntill their equall diuision and limitation follow, it shall be free for the Tar∣tars and Cossackes to Hunt wilde Beasts, and it shall no whit impeach the <HI>Pacta Conuent:</HI> although in this respect they may happen to fall together by the eares, and seeke their reuenges.</P>
<P N="3">3. When the <HI>Tartar Chrim</HI> shall goe vpon any expedition to serue the Turkish Emperour, he shall not touch or damnifie his Maiesties Lands, and to the end that in this case either may know his bounds there shall bee Commissioners <HI>ex vtra{que} parte</HI> ordai∣ned, and by them certaine limits appointed, as also Ouerseers for the blacke Sea, and those rouers.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Respublicae Pol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a,</HI> yeeldeth and accordeth henceforth to pay vnto the Tartar the accustomed Tribute which hee shall demaund by his Ambassa∣dors, and in this respect the Hospodar of Walachia, shall alwayes be an vnderstanding peaceable man, and a Christian, and shall helpe to keepe the Tartars in Office, &amp; gouernment, that they attempt nothing
<PB N="48" REF="26"/> <HI>Contra pacta,</HI> or if they doe to receiue punishment, according to the nature of the offence and tryall: And if his Maiesty shall haue such occasion, then shall the Tartars assist him against his enemies: In a word, they shalbe obliged to serue the Kingdome.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is granted, that <HI>Chochim</HI> shall be deliuered vnto the Hospodar of Walachia, with all the ap∣purtenances formerly belonging to that Fort.</P>
<P N="6">6. Vnto all those which are the Turkes enemies, shall the King and Kingdome of Poland, be likewise Enemies, and a friend vnto all his Friends: and in the same manner shall the Turkish Emperour be obliged to the Crowne of Poland.</P>
<P N="7">7. All these Conditions were sworne by the said Commissioners, and they were written in Polish, Turkish, and Latine, and the following great Am∣bassadors in like manner <HI>facta renouatione</HI> on both partes shall confirme the same, and continue the maintaining of the ancient <HI>Pacta</HI> by their Oathes: They were also vnder written by the Viceer of the Army of Turkes, the Mufty, and a Doctor of Law: but on our side, by <HI>Stanislane Zorarmiski, Castellan</HI> of <HI>Belsen,</HI> and <HI>Iames</HI> of <HI>Sobniski</HI> the Palatine, Sonne of <HI>Lubelski,</HI> in the name of the Kings Maiesty, and of the Generall <HI>Stanislane Lubomirski,</HI> Captaine of <HI>Zando∣mir:</HI> with the other Commissioners deputed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P>Thus (gentle Reader) thou hast likewise the last Letter with the conditions of peace, as they were then ratified by the Turks, and King of Poles Com∣missioners: there were also read in publique the old
<PB N="49" REF="26"/> contracts, containing the limitation of their King∣domes, and the mentioning their friends and con∣federates, with all tributary Prouinces, and many other things impertinent at these times: all which I haue omitted to trouble you withall, resoluing only to satisfie you with a plaine truth of the end of the Warre, and to tell you a wonder in the making the truce: the vse is meerely to set out the glory of God, who can turne the frame of heauen about, and bring that to passe with easinesse, which the wisedome of man thinketh impossible, and the pollicy of King∣domes determineth to contriue another way: and to discredite the ostentation of Princes, who out of their owne presumption can boast of great matters: but when the cause comes to bee decided in the Court of Heauen, they are laughed to scorne, and a contrary sentence condemneth them, as delinquents to the Maiestie of God, and offenders against their owne soules and consciences.</P>
<P>Since this, I haue also receiued other Letters a∣mongst the Marchants from Constantinople, dated the 10. of December, which make mention of the Grand Signieurs being at Andrinopolis, but is not yet come to the great Citie: onely the Haga of Ia∣nizaries, and certaine Officers of the Seralio are ar∣riued to prepare the Pallace, and clense the Towne, that both Court and Citie may be fit for his enter∣tainment. And amongst the rest, there is one thing most remarkable, that his Vnkle <HI>Mustapha,</HI> when he was deposed, did Prophesie of this peace: and in a manner foretolde, that the <HI>Ottaman</HI> Empire was at
<PB N="30" REF="27" MS="y"/> the highest, and should no further enlarge the sunne, but rather decline, and see their renowne shadowed with malignity of time: But because his Spirit was not answerable to his greatnes, the Ianizaries neg∣lected him: nor his wisdome for lacke of publicke conuersation, as being alwayes kept Prisoner, satis∣factory to the gouernment, hee was the sooner put downe, and so as yet he remaines vnstrangled, and peraduenture vnrespected.</P>
<P>There now remaines no more, but for the Poles to fortefie their confines, &amp; stand vpon their Guard for all this Contract of amity, and treatice of purification, considering the fry of Nations, that lye Eastward from them, who either are enemies to Christian Religion as Idolaters, and Mahumetans: or indeed of no Religion, as running the violent race of Sauagenes and beastiallity, all which good care and vigilancy will preuent, considering as I haue often said, they are naked men, haue no Disci∣pline, and are to seeke when they come to Trenches and Fortifications: Yet for all this good successe: and prosperous euent of the Warre? I would nei∣ther haue them too presumptuous, or elated, as though their owne Arme of flesh had done it: nor tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rous or exanimated though they heare of the Turkes preparation against them. For it is not the sound of 2. or 300000. of men can conquer Coun∣tries and Kingdomes, but the extraordinary valour of well disciplined Souldiers, nor are they likewise to boast with the <HI>Syreans</HI> that they can licke vp the dust of <HI>Samaria,</HI> and transferre the Diadems of Prin∣ces
<PB N="31" REF="27" MS="y"/> at their pleasure, but to know there is a God of Battailes, that made <HI>Gideons</HI> 300. ouerrunne the <HI>Mi∣dianites,</HI> and will doe wonders for his Church in de∣spight of the watchings of the Dragon: yea I make no doubt but that the same God, which hath deli∣uered Christendome from the Turkes excursions as you haue heard, will also deliuer the Protestant Princes from the Popes Curses, and Antichristian threatnings, as you shall shortly see, And so I end with the Poet:
<Q><L>O melibace Deus nobis haec otia faecit,</L>
<L>Nam{que} erit ille mihi semper Deus, illius vram</L>
<L>Saepe tener nostris ad ouilibus imbuet agnus.</L></Q></P>
