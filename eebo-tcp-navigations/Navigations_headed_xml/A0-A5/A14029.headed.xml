<HEAD>To the Right honou∣rable <HI>and renowmed Ba∣rons, the Lord George, Hugh</HI> and Vitus, brethren, of the auncient <HI>house of the</HI> Schonburges. <HI>Lordes of Glaucha, and Waldenburge:</HI> Ierome Turler <HI>sendeth gréeting.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">R</SEG>Yght</HI> hono∣rable and renou∣med Barons, it is nobly written by <HI>Isocrates,</HI> that chil¦dren oughte too keepe their fathers Friends as diligēt∣ly: as they woulde their owne inheri∣tance. And your father of worthy me∣morie, loued my father deerely, &amp; hee liued togither with your Grandfather many yeeres in the Courte of Duke George the noble Duke of <HI>Saxonie,</HI> and he was borne in the dayes of your Greatgrandfather of <HI>Austine Turler</HI> his father, who was then Consull of
<PB REF="3"/> <HI>Lesnick,</HI> which towne is vnder your in∣risdiction at this day, and whereof my Vncle is nowe at this present Con∣sull, one whom yee knowe ryghtwell. Wherefore, I haue often deuised with my self, by what meanes I might like∣wise continue this frendship, or rather testefie my dutie towards you &amp; your familie, and if it could bee, how to en∣large the same, but hetherto I coulde finde no good opportunitie, for that yee were of so smal yeeres that wanted rather instruction in discretion, and good manners: then to bee occupied in debating of graue matters, and also yee had such instructers, and schoole∣maisters, that if yee followed their do∣cumentes there should redownd great honour to your selues, and great com∣moditie to your subiectes. Albeit then it be so, that ye haue no neede of myne admoniciō, either to the studie of ver∣tue &amp; godlinesse, or towards the attai∣ning of good artes &amp; learning: yet the significatiō of a mans dutie is wont to be acceptable to good natures, &amp; such
<PB REF="3"/> especially such as are of Nobilitie, and descended of the greatest parentage. Thus staying my self vpō this groūd: I sēd vnto ye this booke which I haue written in the behalf of such as are de∣sierous to traueill, and to see forreine Cuntries, &amp; specially of students. For since Experience is the greatest parte of humane wisedome, and the same is increased by traueil: I suppose there is no man will deney, but that a mā may become the wiser by traueiling. How beit if in any thing: surely in this most diligent circumspection is very requi∣site, by reason of the daungers that of∣fer themselues vnto traueilers, and the weakenesse of mans iudgment, which vnlesse it be then confirmed by vse &amp; experience, and holpen by the counsel of others: it will soone be brought into errour. Here is moreouer to be added, that the youth and flourishing yeeres are moste commonly employd in tra∣ueill, which of their owne course and condicion are inclined vnto vice, and much more ernestly imbrace the same
<PB REF="4"/> if it be entised thereto, which manica time and often chaunceth in trauey∣ling: wherfore, mee thinkes they do a good deede, and well deserue of al mē: that gyue preceptes of traueyling. Which thing, althoughe I perceyue that some haue doone: yet haue they doone it heere and there in sundrie Bookes, and not in any one certeine place. And being a necessarie thing to haue all such matter in a readinesse as may well and profitably be said of one thing: I haue therefore handled that argument according to the definitiue Methode, as they speake in the schooles, and haue comprehended al∣so, as I iudge, in one Booke, whatsoe∣uer is necessarie for any to know con∣cerning the due taking in hand of tra∣ueill, and the prosperous perfourming of the same. I haue also adioyned vn∣to this discourse another booke, wher∣in I haue applied those preceptes of mine, vnto such things as seemed vnto me worthy the seing and obseruing in the Realme of <HI>Naples,</HI> which beeinge
<PB REF="4"/> none other thing then an example of such documentes as wee haue set down in the first Booke: I haue therefore made the title vnto all the whole wri∣ting, <HI>Of Traueill, and of the Realme of Naples,</HI> because no man shall thinke that I haue coupled contrary thinges togither. For although in deede it bee one thing to intreate of the Realme of <HI>Naples,</HI> and another thing to giue pre∣ceptes vnto such as meane to traueill: yet since traueiling consisteth of view∣ing &amp; diligent consideratiō of things, and preceptes are lightned by exam∣ples: there is no iust impediment to the contrarie, but that I maye ioyne these twaine togither. And as I haue also admonished in the booke: I trust that this my labour will bee the more acceptable vnto some, for the same cause. For if they shall want preceptes they shall finde them heere in a readi∣nesse, and if they do require an exam∣ple agreeable to preceptes, they haue heere suche a one beefore their eyes which may both instruct their mindes
<PB REF="5"/> and also inflame them vnto the know¦ledge of most bewtifull sightes, and Antiquitie. Receiue in good parte, Right honorable and renoumed Ba∣rons, this simple gifte from mee, and therin my dutie and seruice towardes ye and your familie. Which if it shall please you to do: I wil do min indeuor to omit nothing which I may thinke to tende vnto the commendation and ornament of your house: and that my good will may be knowen vn∣to you hereafter, by some tra∣ueill of more graue ar∣gument.</P>

<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His worde Pe∣regrinus</HI> which signifi∣eth a straunger or tra∣ueiler, in the Latine tongue in sundrye ages hath had sundry significations. For as <HI>Varro,</HI> and <HI>Festus Pomponius</HI> doe re∣port, y<SUP>e</SUP> auntient <HI>Romans</HI> called an ene∣mie by the name of <HI>Peregrinus</HI> a stran∣ger: and an enemie whom they cal now at this present <HI>Hostis,</HI> they tearmed thē <HI>Perduellis:</HI> in which significatiō it was thus written in the lawes of the xij ta∣bles: <HI>If you haue appoynted anye daie with a straunger you muste needes come.</HI> But that worde grewe out of the signi∣fication of a straunger, and continued so long in signifying one that was our ad∣uersarie, or tooke armes against vs, vn∣till it fell to a more gentle vse, the <HI>Ro∣manes</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="10"/> calling all such only by the name of Straungers as were not frée of the Citie of <HI>Rome,</HI> as beeing perhaps La∣tines borne, or altogither Aliens: and in this signification it is vsed at this pre∣sent. So that this worde <HI>Peregrinari</HI> to traueile, descendeth from the worde <HI>Pe∣ragrare</HI> to wander, which signifieth to traueyle in straunge and forreine Cun∣treyes, to wander in places aswell vn∣knowne as knowne out of a mans own Cuntrey, or Citie. Which may well be perceiued by the testimonie of <HI>Plautus,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plautus.</NOTE> where he sayth: <HI>I am a Straunger,</HI> that is to saye, borne in a forreine lande, <HI>I knowe not Sauria. &amp;c.</HI> And likewise it appeareth in <HI>Cicero: which Citizens,</HI> (sayth hée) <HI>are better then Straungers, &amp;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cicero.</NOTE> <HI>our owne Countreymen, then aliens,</HI> that is to saye, then those that come he∣ther to dwell, from other places. Here∣hence it commeth, that wée call strange trées, and straunge birdes, which eysher were brought vnto vs from other pla∣ces, or else were neuer seene amongst vs béefore. Likewise, straunge seruing of God with vnaccustomed rites and
<PB N="3" REF="10"/> maners which eyther wée haue boro∣wed frō other places for religions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake, or else are by vs lykewise celebrated &amp; executed not after our owne custome, but after some rare and straunge order. After this maner that wee now speake of, the seruice and Sacrifice of the noble and great mother of y<SUP>e</SUP> Gods (who was called <HI>Cybala,</HI> and <HI>Rhea,</HI> and by many others names moe) also of <HI>Ceres,</HI> and <HI>Aesculapius,</HI> might well bée called of the <HI>Romans,</HI> straunge, eyther for that they were far set, namely out of <HI>Phrigia, Greece,</HI> and <HI>Epidaurus:</HI> eyther for that, looke howe they were vsed in those pla∣ces, euen so were they in <HI>Rome</HI> also. Moreouer, there is mencion made in the Ciuile lawe of a straunge <HI>Praetor,</HI> and likewise in y<SUP>e</SUP> Canon law of strange iudgementes. In <HI>Iustinians Code</HI> this <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Code</NOTE> woorde <HI>Peregrinus</HI> a straunger, is som∣time takē for one that is brought away to another place, sometime for one that wandre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> abroade hauing no certeyne place of abode, wherein I haue noted this much, bicause I woulde gladly o∣mitte nothing that myght apperteyne
<PB N="4" REF="11"/> to the signification of that woord wherof wée presently entreate. All which mat∣ters béeing omitted, this is an auncient question, <HI>whether traueyling do a man</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> common <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uestion.</NOTE> <HI>more good or harme?</HI> which seeyng that it lieth more in the power of Fortune then in our owne good will and indus∣try, it may séeme that it is but a vayne matter to mooue any such question▪ But in very déede the truth of the thing stan∣deth otherwyse. For those that traueyl, all doo not commit thēselues to straunge and forreyne Cuntryes, to the entent <NOTE PLACE="marg">E</NOTE> to consume there their time in idlenesse, to bée subiect as a mocking stocke vnto Fortune: but they haue sometimes iust causes that mooue them, and some pro∣posed <NOTE PLACE="marg">C</NOTE> ende in respecte wherof they take in hande theyr traueyll. Wherefore, wée must distinguishe this kind of tra∣ueyll which hath some certeyne ende proposed, from that which is taken in hande onely for Idlenesse sake: Howbe∣it this last kinde cannot iustly bée called by the name of Idlenesse, since it hath some small delight, yet not tending at all to any ende, adioyning vnto it. For
<PB N="5" REF="11"/> true delight and pleasure, is sought for in respect of some ende, and whereas is no end, there also can bée no pleasure: for in all kinde of trauailing there is certen paine &amp; labour contained, which repug∣neth against idlenesse tending vnto ver∣tue not to vice, insomuch that if wée doe vprightly weigh the thing: we shal then finde, that, <HI>Traueill is nothing else but a paine taking to see and searche forreine landes, not to bee taken in hande by all sorts of persons, or vnaduisedly, but such as are meete thereto, eyther to the ende that they may attayne to suche artes and knowledge as they are desirous to learne or exercise: or else to see, learne, and di∣ligently to marke suche things in strange Countries, as they shall haue neede to vse in the common trade of lyfe, wher∣by they maye profite themselues, their friendes, and Countrey if neede require.</HI> This definition who so marketh well, hée shall easely make answere to the question erewhile propounded. For hée shall not onelye discerne traueyll from sluggish Idlenesse, whilest he pla∣ceth
<PB N="6" REF="12"/> this worde, <HI>Payne,</HI> for the generall signification which the Logicians do cal <HI>Genus,</HI> but also comprehendeth manie other thinges, which the Rethoritians, and Logicians doe vsually handle by <HI>Thesis</HI> and <HI>Hipothesis,</HI> definite and in∣definite questions, whollye settinge downe béefore our eyes whatsoeuer ap∣perteineth to this present question. And whereas all kinde of paynes are not ta∣ken in traueilyng, therefore haue I cal∣led it, <HI>the payne to see and serch,</HI> wher∣to I adde these wordes, <HI>Foraine Lands,</HI> that I may distinguishe it from small and short iourneis, which enie man ta∣keth in hande for pleasures sake in his owne cuntrey.

<P>NAture teacheth vs, that Infants, A∣ged persons, &amp; such as haue weake bodies, are of al others lesse meet to tra∣ueill. And although it oftentimes chan∣ceth through the iniquitie of the tyme, or some common calamitie thereto con∣straining, that persons of such age and condicion are enforced to traueill: yet are they vnméet for it, not being able to abide those paynes that accustomablye befal to traueillers. Like as <HI>Iacob</HI> mée∣tinge with his brother <HI>Esau,</HI> excuseth himselfe from traueylynge by reason of his young Children, who if they were weryed but with one dayes traueill, wold die w<SUP>c</SUP> the paines of so long a iour∣ney.

For the Dutch Wéemen, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dutch wee∣men.</NOTE> those that inhabit the Ilands of <HI>Sealand,</HI> doe not only occupy buying &amp; selling at home, more dilygently then y<SUP>t</SUP> men doe: but they traueil also vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> furthermost partes of the world to trafacque and oc∣cupy Merchaindize. And for so doynge they are neuer a whit the more discom∣mended, especially amonge their owne cuntrye folke. But in other regions of this our <HI>Europe,</HI> y<SUP>e</SUP> same custome is not obserued, as it was not also vsuall a∣mōgst our auntiēt fathers in foretime: as it playnely appeareth by example of
<PB N="9" REF="13"/> <HI>Medea,</HI> who when shée ascended into y<SUP>t</SUP> Castle and Temple of <HI>Corinthe,</HI> inde∣uoringe by all meanes to perswade the Matrones and kepers of the same tem∣ple, that they should suspect no éeuell, in that shee had bene so longe absent from her owne cuntrey, forsomuch as many haue cōmendably béehaued themselues being out of their owne natiue soyles: they gaue her no answer at all, that shée might vnderstand, that the wide wan∣dring of Wéemen cannot want suspiti∣on, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Weeme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Traueil.</NOTE> &amp; bringeth some tokē of dishonestie. Whereupon the Tragicall and Comi∣call Poets, when they bringe in any far traueiling Woman, for the most parte they feine her to be incontinent. Sem∣blably, frantique and furious Persons are vnfit to traueill. For séeinge that they are distracte of their right wittes, they are accompted also vnméet to deale in all ciuile affaires. There bée lyke∣wise manie thinges moe, that stay sun∣drye from trauellinge, that whoso shall bée frée and voyd of them: then they are not forbidden to take y<SUP>e</SUP> labor in hand, es∣pecially in their youth, or at mans state
<PB N="10" REF="14"/> For these ages are not onely fit to en∣dure Labours, but those things whiche we sée, heare, and learne at those dayes are soonest fired in memory and longest continue. Which being so: it may then séeme straunge, that <HI>Plato,</HI> an excellent <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mato.</NOTE> Philosopher, and a moste dyligent sear∣cher out of all thinges, hath especiallye apoynted that tearme of mans lyfe vnto traueill, whiche is betwéene fiftye and thréescore. For since at y<SUP>e</SUP> time al the strength of mans body beginneth to de∣creace, it séemeth very ridiculous for the age that then is weakned, and drawing apace to death to bée oppoynted vnto youthly labours, and as the cōmon say∣ing is, to heape one mischiefe vpon ano∣ther. But I lyke of <HI>Platoes</HI> opinion well enough. For hée forbiddeth not but that younger men also may traueill, being not otherwise possible but y<SUP>e</SUP> men wyll pas and repasse the seas, and other∣wise to, which he also affirmeth. Wher∣fore, such as haue time and leasure, and are desierous to sée the trades and ma∣ners of other peoples, bee wyll not haue prohibited by enie laws to the con∣trarie:
<PB N="11" REF="14"/> bicause that a desolate Citie, and such an one as knoweth not what is good or bad in forein countreys, is verie far from perfection. And whereas hee hath apointed that terme of yéeres to be emploid in traueill: the reason is this, for that hée would haue that time espe∣ciallye to bée béestowed in learninge of maners and searchinge other know∣ledge. For since at those yéeres mans iudgement is moste perfect: hée is the better able to discerne and iudge of mat∣ters, then in his youth, or old age, wher∣of the one is rather enclined to vice then vertue and is ruled by affection, the other beginneth to fail in memory, and cannot well vse the iudgement of the sences. And although hée forbidde not young men to traueill, wherby they al∣so may sumdeale profite in maners and knowledge: notwithstandinge foras∣much as that age is but of weake iudg∣ment, hee cōmitteth that care to men of ryper yéeres, not so much for priuat, as for common cōmodytie. For he willeth them at their retourne home, diligently to reporte vnto the Senate whatsoeuer
<PB N="12" REF="15"/> notable thing and worthy of memorye they haue séene in forreine cuntries, ei∣ther concerning lawes, or bringing vp, or appertaininge to knowledge, that if it might happen the same to be liked of, it might be receiued into the common wealth. And lyke as there bee many thinges that may hinder a man from traueiling although he woulde neuer so faine: so may there also bee diuers and sundry causes why a man ought to tra∣ueill, and those likewise sumtimes such whereof a man neuer thought before. For some men are naturally enforced to traueill, or rather to wander abroad after the maner of <HI>Cilenius,</HI> as those in whose natyuitie the moone is placed w<SUP>t</SUP> <HI>Mercurie</HI> in the nineth house, especially in a moouable signe, or soome other lyke iudgemente in this matter: and other some grow into that nature by custom. And others agayne traueill for gaines, and commoditie, as Merchantes: some for vertues sake, as those that apply the studie of good Arts: howbeit these also reape gayne and commoditie of traueill at their due time &amp; season. For, Gain is
<PB N="13" REF="15"/> two fold, the one honest, which is ioyned vnto vertue and honor, &amp; that which the students and professours of good arts do attayne. Likewise souldyeurs which a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> content with their pay, as <HI>S. Iohn</HI> saith: and Merchantes if they desire to waxe ritch after no dishonest sort. The other kind of gaine is dishonest, which repug∣neth w<SUP>t</SUP> nature and vertue, such as they do practize which giue themselus wholy to robbing and spoyling, who being vn∣mindfull of the law of armes, and of the Oth which souldiours take: do not spare nor abstaine from their friendes goods. That kind of gain also which is cōmon∣ly hatefull among men, as vsurers, and others that heap vp wealth by right or wrong with such gredines and auarice, that as the Poet saith, they run to the furthest Indians, and all to eschew po∣uertie, leauing nothing vnassaied wher∣of they may raise to themselues some gain. Which occasiō, as I suppose, mo∣ued <HI>Cicero,</HI> to distinguishe filthye artes from other, and to iudge nothing to bee profitable, which was not also honest.</P>
<P>But principally wee must weigh and
<PB N="14" REF="16"/> examine vnto what ende wée take our traueill vpon vs. For since all thing is done for some ende, it were taken in hand in vaine, vnlesse it were also di∣rected vnto some certen scope. But as the Philosophers doe distinguishe, of endes &amp; purposes: some bée séemely and lawful: other not séemely, or wandring. Moreouer, of those that bée séemely, one is tearmed principall and last of all, to whō when wée haue attained then wée at rest and séeke for none farther: an∣other is lesse principall or meane, which again is distinguished into subordinate, and not subordinate, but by any meanes hapning. Let this varietie of endes ther∣fore bee considered, and one of them seuerallye examyned from another, bycause this consideration bringeth great profite with it. For not onely na∣ture requireth vs so too doo, but also pro∣fit, and diligence, which are to bée sought in all things that wée do. For the princi∣pall ende is more profitable then the o∣ther, and there is more labour required in attaining him, then the residue. So then it is a thing importing more pro∣fit,
<PB N="15" REF="16"/> and it requireth also more traueill, to go into <HI>Italy,</HI> &amp; to returne home againe passing well furnished with the know∣ledge of Phisicke or Lawe, then it dothe to vnderstande how the <HI>Venetians</HI> go∣uerne their common wealth, or what is done at <HI>Rome</HI> vppon their <HI>Saturnalia</HI> feast dayes. <HI>Fridericus Furius Coerio∣lanus</HI> whom I vsed familiarly during my continuance at <HI>Louane,</HI> telleth an excellent Historie in a certen Booke of his, and bicause it teacheth y<SUP>e</SUP> same which wee declare in this place: I will not <NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> spare to recite it. A certen gentleman of <HI>Naples</HI> requested of his kinsman which was a noble man and had the tuition of him, that hée might haue licence to go sée forreine Cuntries, vnto whom hys kinsman promised hée shoulde, if first hée would traueill to <HI>Rome</HI> which was not farre of, and there abide a certeyne time. The younge gentleman obeying his commaundement went thither, and afterwarde returned home, still calling vpon his kinsman that he might goe a greater iourney. But whē his kinsman perceyued that hée had taken no profite
<PB N="16" REF="17"/> by that traueill: said vnto him, Sonne, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sum of Trauei∣lynge.</NOTE> you haue séene Medowes, Plaines, Hilles, Valleis, Earables, Woods, Fo∣rests, Fields, Springs, Riuers, Trées, Thickets, Villages, Castles, Cities, Beastes, Bathes, Galleries, Colosseis, Churches, Pallaices, Pillers, Images, Buildinges, Downefalles, Towers, Amphitheatres, Triumphall Arches, Baines, Stéeples, Vniuersities, Schooles, Gardeins, Conduites, Good∣men and Knaues, Ritche and Poore, Learned and Ignoraunt, and whatso∣euer may else be found within the com∣passe of the whole world: abide therfore nowe henceforwarde at home, and con∣tent your selfe. Thus that most pru∣dente Prince, did briefly recite whatso∣euer might bée saide in such a matter, and wittely set downe the right order and rule to traueill ouer the worlde, wherby hée might reprooue the abuse of traueiling. Notwithstanding a man maye by one labour attaine to diuerse endes. As for example, by traueiling into <HI>Italy,</HI> he may get the knowledge of Phisicke or Lawe, and vnderstand also
<PB N="17" REF="17"/> the gouernment of the state of <HI>Venice.</HI> Which when it happeneth in this wise, certen also it is y<SUP>t</SUP> the commoditie which insueth theron must néedes be the grea∣ter. Wée must also take heede that the commoditie bee good and honest which wée receyue by our traueyll. For these two poyntes are not in vayne knit togyther by wyse men, and many tymes there is an ouersight éeuen in common wealthes, vnder couler of profite, and commoditie. And the ver∣tue of honestie is such, that it preser∣ueth the bewtie of profite. So that they which seperate honestie from profite: they alwayes obtayne not their true ende, nor yet reape that commoditie which they ought to doe. But for as∣muche as in all humane affayres, wée must consider to what ende, and for what commoditie they are taken in hande: then ought wée most especial∣ly too bée myndefull thereof in traueill. For who so traueyleth in any other re∣specte, hée spendeth his time in vayne, consumeth his goodes to no purpose, en∣damageth
<PB N="18" REF="18"/> the health of his bodye, and daungereth his life, casting himselfe in∣to a thousand perilles, nothing profiting himselfe or others.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The.</HI> 3. <HI>Chapter.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe ende of our traueill being deter∣mined, and hauing in our minde the hope of great profite which shall ensue to vs thereby, a man must so prouide for euerie thynge, that aboue all hée haue regarde to hys health, whether it bée of bodye, or soule. For hée that doth not so, but dependeth al vpō Fortune, be shal make God his enemy, hurt his con∣science, and expose himself to a thousand daungers. For immediatly he hath ope∣ned, as it were, a window vnto infinite mischieues, &amp; hath gotten a most large <NOTE PLACE="marg">The feare of God.</NOTE> fielde to offend in. But who so commit∣teth
<PB N="19" REF="18"/> hymselselfe vnto Gods kéepyng, shall bée saued through his protection, as saith the <HI>Psalmiste.</HI> And although many éeuilles and daungers lye in his waye: notwythstanding hée shall not bée moo∣ued. Hée shall also brydle hys affec∣tions: since the cheifest meanes to a∣uoyde sinne, is to auoide the occasion of sinne, wherein hée must employ great diligence, and preuent many imminent daungers by hys wisedome. So <HI>Tobi∣as,</HI> whē hée sent his sunne forth into <HI>Ra∣ges,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tobias.</NOTE> exhorted hym aboue all thinge to feare God, as the chiefest guide of his iourney, and all his affaires. Poetes feygne, that <HI>Aeneas</HI> was couered in a cloude by <HI>Venus,</HI> and diuerse other men also by other Goddes, thereby esca∣pyng not onely the sight of men, and al∣so sundrye perilles that they might haue incurred, thereby to declare that they bée safe from daungers, that are coue∣red with the might and power of God. Which thing likewise y<SUP>e</SUP> holy scripture testifieth in many places saying: <HI>They wente foorthe and the Lorde was with</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="19"/> <HI>them:</HI> and againe, <HI>the Lorde dothe know thy iourney, and thy Lorde thy God hath remained with thee, and thou hast wanted nothinge.</HI> The nexte care is, that hée haue regarde of hys body, that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> doely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>lth.</NOTE> is to saye, to kéepe it sounde and in good health. How this may hée doone, preceptes of Phisitious do declare, and as farre as I am able to say in the mat∣ter: it consisteth in the due vse of the sixe things not naturall, as they tearme them, that is to witte, the Aier, Meate and Drinke, Fulnesse and emptinesse, Exercise and reste, Sléepe and Wat∣ching, and finally, Accidentes and mo∣tions of the minde. For hée that is of a weake constitutiō of body, cannot wel entende those things for which hée hath traueiled. And therfore he ought to haue a more diligent regarde hereto, for that the chaunge of Ayer, of Diet, &amp; custome, doth easely bring with it some sicknesse, although the payne and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the iourney do supply no cause there∣to at all. There be also two other things to hée marked by a Traueiller, name∣lye
<PB N="21" REF="19"/> to applie himselfe to the manners of other, and also to looke to his owne businesse with diligence: whereof the one is very hard for him to doo that hath no rule of himselfe, the other requtreth rather iudgement then will. Howbeit hée must néedes doe them both if hée will do well. For who so meaneth to liue in a straunge lande after his owne fashion, maketh himselfe a mocking-stocke vnto other, and neuer amendeth his owne barbarous &amp; corrupt maners, althoughe hée see daily innumerable ex∣amples of vertues. Hée shall soone sus∣taine losse of his businesse that dealeth therin necligētly. It is after one maner that wée liue at home, and another that wée line abroade, and some nations are more gyuen to craste and deceite then others, which many haue tryed to their great paine. Wherefore wée must lyue warely among forreine nations, and take hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de wée offende them in no case, being mindfull of the Gréeke prouerbe, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, meaning that we must <NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> applye our selues to the Manner and
<PB N="22" REF="20"/> Cuntrie, and yet haue regarde to our owne affayres, hauing alwayes re∣spect vnto honestie. In <HI>Clemens Alex∣andrinus</HI> is cited this verse of <HI>Heracli∣tus,</HI> thus to bée Englished.</P>
<L>Many Cuntries tis good to see,</L>
<L>Preseruing still our honestie.</L>
<P>In which, as the same <HI>Clemens</HI> saith, is proposed an example of a Philosophi∣call life, where he saith y<SUP>t</SUP> we shuld go sée manye forreine nacions for knowledge sake, but not to ensue y<SUP>e</SUP> vices of strange Cuntreyes, that is to saye, hée admo∣nisheth vs to vndertake many iournies for intent to learne, still retaynynge the integritie of our maners, and condi∣cions. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eware <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rruption.</NOTE> For although some cuntries cary a certen suspicion of lust and licentious∣nes: yet neuer to haue beheld any parte therof, but alwaies continently to haue liued in the same, is no small praise and glory. Let vs not therfore leaue any to∣ken of our owne fylthines in Forreyne Regions, nor let vs learne there any vile crime to bring home with vs into our owne cuntrey, but let vs insue ver∣tue
<PB N="23" REF="20"/> and exercise godlynesse in all pla∣ces wheresoeuer wée béecome. Which who so doth, through the power of God shall not onely escape the cruell <HI>Scylla</HI> and <HI>Charybdis,</HI> and contemne the most swéete sower alluringe Songes of the <HI>Syrenes:</HI> but lyke a most experte Pilot <NOTE PLACE="marg">Syrenes Songes.</NOTE> that passeth vnder Sayle in the midst of the sea, shall as much as may bée auoide all quicksandes and perillous Rockes, the sworne Enemies of them that passe by the déepe. Thys also a Traueiler muste diligentlye prouide for, that hée lacke not his chiefe necessaryes, which the Logicians terme, <HI>Destinata,</HI> thynges apperteyning to his purpose, as vnto studye béelonge Bookes, and Teachers: vnto Warfare, Harneys, Weapons, Horses, Captaines, w<SUP>c</SUP> suche other lyke. So then, lyke as a souldi∣our cannot attayne his ende if hée lacke hys Weapons: neyther can a student if hée lacke Bookes, &amp; if other also lacke other thinges necessarye for their vse, accordynge to the diuersitie of theyr state, and callynge. Finallye, thou
<PB N="24" REF="21"/> must indeuour by all meanes possible, to attaine to thy purpose and ende the ryght waye and order, omitting all vnnecessarie circumstaunces. For so shalt thou take lesse paynes, and all thing shalbée doone wyth more ripe∣nesse and better iudgement. For the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The great force of Or∣der in all things.</NOTE> same truely is of so great force in all worldly and humane affayres, that vnlesse a man vse some good and com∣mendable order in performyng them: hée laboureth in vayne, or to lyttle pro∣fite. Wherfore, some haue written how a man shall béehaue himselfe in War∣fare, &amp; of the whole order of warfare, as hath <HI>Vegetius:</HI> some haue taught how we should béehaue our selues in the stu∣die of Phisick or Law, or in other artes and Sciences, whereby a man may in shorter time attaine vnto them, &amp; reape fruite and commodie out of them.</P>
<P>The commoditie and profit of trauei∣ling is dispersed throughout and in all things of the world, and there is no hu∣mane action or trade to be founde, but it may bée bettered and holpen by traueil.
<PB N="25" REF="21"/> And y<SUP>e</SUP> I may say nothing of vile artes, are not all artes and trades according to the diuersitie of them, better exercised in one place then another? is not this thinge best handled in such a place, and that in another? which if a man be de∣sirous to learne, it were best for him to traueill thither, rather then lerne them at home of others whiche haue not per∣fectly learned them themselues. So in <HI>Germanie, Italie, Fraunce</HI> and <HI>Spayne,</HI> the art of Printing is much vsed, but a∣mong the <HI>Getes</HI> it is not knowne. And not onely cuntreys far distant hence, do practize other artes: but also those that be néere vnto vs. As the Arte of Prin∣ting is as much frequented in <HI>England</HI> as in <HI>Germanie,</HI> and <HI>Fraunce:</HI> in <HI>Ire∣land</HI> it is nothing so, and yet <HI>Ireland</HI> ly∣eth néere vnto <HI>England,</HI> and vnder obe∣diēce to y<SUP>e</SUP> same Quéene. The English∣men ar excellent archers, but the <HI>Irish∣men</HI> bee better, and more experte in swimming, excellinge all other nacions of <HI>Europe</HI> in running and diuing vnder water. How much good, traueill doth
<PB N="26" REF="22"/> to a Carpenter, <HI>Vitruuius</HI> teacheth: how much to a Souldiour <HI>Vegetius</HI> sheweth: how much to a Paynter or Keruer, the horses made by <HI>Fideas</HI> and <HI>Praxiteles,</HI> standing yet at this present in the Church of <HI>Romulus</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI> do testifie, with other <HI>Collossi,</HI> Statues, I∣mages, and Pictures, which there is no woorkeman beholdeth, but he wondreth at them, and departeth away more cun∣ning thē he came. I wil speake nothing of Merchandize, which is altogether, as it were nourished by traueill, and not occupyed somuch for honesty sake: as for commodytie and lucre. Let vs sur∣uey the studies of humanyty which are comprehended vnder the name of Phi∣losophy, &amp; wée shall finde that in aunti∣ent times they were partly inuented &amp; deriued from y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Egiptians</HI> vnto other na¦tiōs, &amp; afterward brought into <HI>Europe,</HI> continuing also along while in <HI>Greece,</HI> from whence they arriued in <HI>Italy,</HI> and from thence were dispearsed abroad in∣to other Regions of <HI>Europe,</HI> as it were into <HI>Colonies,</HI> &amp; places of lyberties w<SUP>t</SUP>in themselues. And who wyldeny y<SUP>t</SUP> there
<PB N="27" REF="22"/> is enie profite receyued by Philosophy, or that sumtime it flourished in <HI>Greece</HI> in such sort: that from al places men tra∣ueilled into that cuntry to be instructed therein, as it had bene to some faier, or mercate? which <HI>Plutarch</HI> wel signified, saying, that there were no men at all, if there wer not a sea wherby they might passe into <HI>Greece.</HI> For that graue &amp; wise Philosopher, iudged that none could bée <NOTE PLACE="marg">Philoso∣phers are onely men.</NOTE> called by the name of men, vnlesse they were instructed in Philosophye, for as much as wyt, and verteous furniture of the minde, maketh men, not the forme or figure of the Body. But now this in∣struction of wittes is quite taken away from <HI>Greece</HI> together with the empire, and it is to be feared, lest shortly also it be taken from other places whether as y<SUP>e</SUP> study of lyberall Arts are extended, &amp; in stéed therof y<SUP>e</SUP> old barbarousnes come in place after awhile. Touchīg historis, &amp; y<SUP>t</SUP> woorks of Poets, what shall I néede to giue any admoniciō? In whose books there be some suchthinge, which nether by eloquence of words, or construction
<PB N="28" REF="23"/> can bee expressed, neithe by dilygence of interpretours expounded, but that ra∣ther they require to bée séene with the eye. As when in <HI>Virgill</HI> mencion is made of certayne pictures, very lyuely expressinge the lineamentes of nature, which <HI>Aeneas</HI> béeheld in <HI>Didos</HI> Temple séeming to containe in them verye mo∣tions of mind, affections, and true teares indéede: the Poet therupon sayinge:</P>
<P><HI>Great grief bringes teares, and mor∣tal haps, make mortal harts to rue.</HI> That is to say, a man wold suppose, that those Images and Pictures had wept indéed, and that those paincted and counterfei∣ted bodies, were mooued with compasti∣on one of them towards another. Histo∣ries reporte, that <HI>Zensis</HI> &amp; <HI>Parrasius</HI> the Painters, fell in contention for the ex∣cellencie, at what time the one of them painted Grapes so liuely that hee decei∣ned Birdes with them: the other pain∣ted a Shéet so woorkemanly that be de∣ceaued him that had deceaued the birds. So lykewise <HI>Prothogenes,</HI> and <HI>Apelles</HI> lines deserned to bee looked vpon, and
<PB N="29" REF="23"/> <HI>Cicero</HI> so highly commended the coun∣terfeite of <HI>Ephigenia</HI> drawne by the Painter <HI>Timantes</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> he supposed that one example to bée sufficient frō which all Oratours and Poetes might take a president and patern to obserue <HI>Deco∣rum,</HI> and cumlynesse in expressinge af∣fections. The lyke is to bee iudged of Antiquitie. For what description of a∣ny place can bée so euident, or what in∣terpretacion so plaine and perspicuous, but y<SUP>e</SUP> béeholding of the thing it self doth far excéede it? And lyke as if wée reade enie thing that is obscure and intricate, wée vnderstande it muche better if wee béeholde some tokens and remnauntes of it, then wée can conceiue by the tra∣ueill of interpretours, or learne by a∣nye semblable coniecture: so lykewise the knowledge of the Antiquitie there∣of, is no lesse pleasant and profitable, which of it self is able alone to stirre vp honest wittes, and nourisheth the slu∣dies of good learning. <HI>Tullie</HI> glorieth in a certen place, that he founde out y<SUP>e</SUP> Se∣pulcher of <HI>Archimedes</HI> the <HI>Geometri∣cian,</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="24"/> by the engrauing of a Sphere an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Cylinder, which he sayeth hée shewed vnto his cuntrimen of <HI>Arpinum,</HI> which sepulcher was ouergrowē with bushes and briars, and much defaced, for that it was long since he died. And nothing in∣ferrior vnto these, haue bin founde also not much before our age, at which a mā may no lesse wonder. Hereof a suffici∣ent witnes is <HI>Raphaell Volaterranus,</HI> writing, that in his time in the way cal∣led <HI>Via Appia</HI> nigh <HI>Rome,</HI> there was <NOTE PLACE="marg">A noble buriall.</NOTE> digged vp the body of a womā, embaul∣med w<SUP>c</SUP> precious oyntmēts, whole, vn∣corrupted, layd vp in a Coffin, and coue∣red with a Marble Stone, hauinge bée∣twéene her féete (as he sayth) a burning Candle whom the liquor of the oynt∣ment nourished, but suddenly went out as soone as the Marble coueringe was remooued: adding moreouer, that diuers supposed that it was the body of <HI>Tullio∣la, Tullies</HI> Daughter whom he loued <NOTE PLACE="marg">Culliola.</NOTE> dearely. Witnesseth also the lyberalitie of Pope <HI>Nicholas</HI> the fift, at whose time lyued one <HI>Cyriacus Anconitanus,</HI> a

Who vpon a time, when one demaunded of hym, why hee bestowed so muche labour in search of such matters: answered, that he would gladly raise some dead man to lyfe: rightly weighing how that many things are decaid and forgotten through proces of time, which might be restored by dyligence of traueilynge, and by in∣dustrie of learned men, preserued from iniurie of obliuion. Yea, what shall we say more, y<SUP>t</SUP> we shuld now haue no Cos∣mography at all, which contayneth the discription of y<SUP>t</SUP> whole world, nor Topo∣graphy, which cōprehendeth y<SUP>e</SUP> descripti∣on of certē priuate places: vnles it were graunted vnto vs through y<SUP>e</SUP> benefite of trauelinge? The auntient Cosmogra∣phers were of opinion, y<SUP>t</SUP> the earth was vnhabitable vnder the Equinoctiall,
<PB N="32" REF="25"/> as also that part of the worlde, whiche stretcheth out beyond the polare circles towards y<SUP>e</SUP> Poles. Which two positiō<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of theirs to be false: partly y<SUP>e</SUP> Nauigaci∣ons <NOTE PLACE="marg">The pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e of Nauiga∣tions.</NOTE> of the Portingales, do teach vs: and partly also those Regions whom the e∣leuation of the North Pole argueth to to lye without the arcticke circle, as are <HI>Gronlādia</HI> and <HI>Willappia,</HI> with other Ilandes lying neere to the frosen Sea, Wherin the Portingall Nauigacions haue not alonely done much good, but in other thinges also. For where as the auncient Writers by the difference of Noonetide shadowes, haue called some men <HI>Periscij</HI> that is to saye, tourninge shadowed, some <HI>Amphiscij</HI> double sha∣dowed, some <HI>Heteroscij</HI> single shadow∣ed: this haue they founde by their Na∣uigations to be true, and vnto the thrée partes of the world, haue found out and adioyned a fourth, namelye <HI>America,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>merica.</NOTE> which for the vnknowne bignesse ther∣of, they think to be an other world, bée∣sides many moe Ilandes vnknowne béefore. Whereby we are the lesse mo∣ued
<PB N="33" REF="25"/> to wounder at the <HI>Antipodes,</HI> or <HI>Antichthones,</HI> that is to say, those who, as <HI>Cicero</HI> hath interpreted, doo tread step for step directly against vs. For the Geometricall reason, sayth <HI>Coperni∣cus,</HI> proueth that <HI>America</HI> lyeth directly on the othersyde agaynst <HI>India Gange∣tica:</HI> the lyke iudgement is also to bee giuen of other regions of the Worlde. Likewise, there is no man doubteth but that traueill was the firste cause of the findinge out of Astronomie, since by it, firste of all the eleuation of the Poles was found out, and by that varietie of <HI>Horizons,</HI> &amp; by them both the differen∣ces of y<SUP>e</SUP> dayes and nightes. But al these thinges beinge omitted, let vs retourne to nature, &amp; vnto grauer studies. There is no man, I thinke that wyl deny, but that the searchinge out of the nature of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The studye of Nature.</NOTE> thinges is most profitable, the same is performed by no meanes more effectu∣ally, then by traueill. As for example sake, Peaches which grow in that cun∣trey from which they tooke their name, are Poyson: but in <HI>Germanie</HI> they
<PB N="34" REF="26"/> are accoumpted amonge delicates and banqueting dishes, which ar both found by traueill. So likewise the Hemlocke that groweth in Germanie, hath not the same force which that hath that grow∣eth in <HI>Italie.</HI> Our Cuntrye of Germa∣nie knoweth not the Date Tree: <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Date tree.</NOTE> howbeit it groweth in <HI>Italie,</HI> but for the moste parte withoute frute: and in <HI>Africa</HI> they abounde in such sort: that they make both meat and drink of the fruit. And to be short, other thīgs grow in other places, which in one place are of more force &amp; vertue then in another, and they also of sundry and dy∣uers kindes, whose properties and qua∣lyties who so is ignoraunt of: is not worthy the name of a Phylosopher, much lesse of a Physicion, who ought to be vnskilfull of nothinge appertayning to the nature and diuersitie of thinges, places, and men. Yea, there bée fruits of sundrye Trées, who amonge the aunti∣ent writters are called after the names of them that founde them, that is to saye, of those that firste brought them
<PB N="35" REF="26"/> out of forreine lands and planted them in their owne. As ar <HI>Manlians</HI> of <HI>Man∣lius, Macians</HI> of <HI>Macius, Claudians</HI> of <HI>Claudius,</HI> as <HI>Plinie</HI> hath noted, and also <HI>Appians</HI> or <HI>Melapians</HI> in smell and bignes lyke Quin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, because <HI>Appi∣us</HI> of the House of <HI>Claudia.</HI> graffed the same firste vpon a Quince.

So <HI>Lucius vitellius</HI> béeing <HI>Censor,</HI> brought the Nut <HI>Pistick</HI> first into Italy, and by the aucthoritie of <HI>Athenaeus</HI> and <HI>Plinie,</HI> wée know that <HI>Lucullus</HI> being generall of the Romane Armye, after that hée had vanquished <HI>Mithridates</HI> and obtayned the vpper∣hande: was the firrst that euer brought <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Che¦rie tree.</NOTE> the Cherietree out of <HI>Cerasus</HI> a certen place and libertie of <HI>Pontus</HI> called nowe <HI>Zephano,</HI> into Italy, cal∣lynge also the Fruite thereof <HI>Cera∣sus</HI> a Cherie, although some bee of

It is also euydent out of y<SUP>e</SUP> same <HI>Athenaeus,</HI> that <HI>Citrions</HI> wer neuer séene nor tasted of within the re∣membraunce of <HI>Plutarches</HI> Grandfa∣thers.

<P>Traueill is also profitable vnto the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tudy of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Law.</NOTE> studie of the Lawe, for that the lawe is more dilygently reade in one place then in another, wherin also are some things of such sorte, that eyther for the ouldnes of them, or for lack of vsing of them: are almost vnknowne how they were vsed in foretimes, vnlesse a man sée them practized before his face. For so haue I my selfe séene in <HI>Padua</HI> in the <HI>Praetors</HI> Pallace, the handlinge of these two poynts, <HI>Lapis turpitudinis,</HI> and <HI>Cessio bonorum,</HI> whereof mencion is made in the glosse vpon the Ciuille Lawe: with sundry other of that kinde, which <HI>Bris∣sionius</HI> hath noted in his books which he wroate of antiquitie of the lawe. It is also a great parte of wisdome, to know
<PB N="37" REF="27"/> the nature and maners of men, &amp; how to liue with with euery body. Therfore whoso traueilleth with discretion, and conferreth strange kingdomes with his owne natiue soyle, béesides the many∣folde commodities which I haue hether∣to recited: hée shall moreouer bringe a∣way this with him, the better to be able to discerne what is good and bad in his owne Cuntrey, he shall also know how to correct and amend eeuel maners, and to furnish himself and others with bet∣ter. Hée shall also haue more skyll how to entertain strangers, and vnderstand the maners of men more perfectly, and according to his affayres and dealinges with them, applie himself vnto them ac∣cording as the circumstance of time and place shal require. He shal know more∣ouer the easines or hardnesse of oportu∣nytie touchinge the méetest times, and fittest places, wherein to say or to doo a∣nything, none shall deceiue him in mis∣reporting of any thing, neither shall hée depende vpon other mens iudgement. For in that respect there be many very
<PB N="38" REF="28"/> bolde and importunate, especially if ther be none to controulle them: as there be lykewise some Aucthours to be founde, who ether for the great loue they bare to their cuntrye, or for goodwyll and af∣fection of them to whom they write, ei∣ther doo aduaunce or extenuate some thinges, that they excéede the credite of an history, and are altogether vnmind∣full of their duty. So that none can bet∣ter reprehende such then they, whiche haue séene the thinges whereof they in∣treate. It is profitable also to traueill a broade into strange Regions, were it but to saue charges of Houshoulde at <NOTE PLACE="marg">Charge of houshould.</NOTE> home.

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> 4. <HI>Chapter.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BVt forasmuch as wee are fallen into discourse of the varietie of maners, and diuersitie of natures in men: I sup∣pose it were not done a mis, to declare the properties of some nacions. Not of all, for y<SUP>e</SUP> were a great labour &amp; peculy∣arly béelonginge vnto them that haue written of the situation of the Worlde: or of the lyfe and maners of sundry na∣cions, as <HI>Strabo, Bohemus</HI> with others: but only of those y<SUP>e</SUP> are chief in <HI>Europe,</HI> that is to say, Germans, Frenchmen, Italians, and Spaniardes. These na∣cions differ sundrye wayes one from another, as, in gesture, gate, voyce, singinge, talke, meanynge, humanytie, conuersation, loue, hatred, affaires,
<PB N="40" REF="29"/> warfare, and other things. Wherefore, breifly to set down the effect of the mat∣ter, and to come to the purpose: the <HI>Germane</HI> hath y<SUP>e</SUP> gesture of a Cutter or <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ger∣mane.</NOTE> Ruffian, the gate of y<SUP>e</SUP> cock, a firce looke, a manlyvoyce, rude behauiour, variable apparell, and nothinge hansome. The <HI>Frenchman</HI> hath a soft gate, a moderate <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Frēch man.</NOTE> pace, a milde countenaunce, a pleasaunt voyce, a redy toongue, modest demea∣nure, immoderate apparell. The <HI>Ita∣lian</HI> hath a slow gate, a graue gesture, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ita∣lian.</NOTE> an inconstance countenaunce, a lowe voyce, an hasty speache, magnificall bée∣hauiour, vndecent and vnséemlye ap∣parell. The <HI>Spaniard,</HI> a commenda∣ble <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Spa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iard.</NOTE> gate, maners, and gesture, a proude looke, a flexible voyce, a fine speach, ex∣quisite apparel. The <HI>Germans</HI> howle in their singinge except the <HI>Dutchmen,</HI> who of them all doo singe ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ede, the <HI>Frenchmen</HI> doo recorde, the <HI>Spani∣ardes</HI> grone, and the <HI>Italians</HI> bleat lyke shéep. The <HI>Germans</HI> are harshe and harde in their speach, and simple. The <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> quicke, and proude: the
<PB N="41" REF="29"/> Spaniardes fine and glorious, the Ita∣lians graue, and craftie: the Germans are coumpted good in counsel, y<SUP>e</SUP> French∣men rashe, Spaniardes crafty, and Ita∣lians clenly. Towardes straungers the Germans are roughe and inhospitable, the Frenchmen gentle, the Spaniardes curteous, and the Italians diligent. In conuersation the Germanes are impe∣rious and intollerable, the Frenchmen milde, the Spaniardes warie, the Itali∣ans prudent. In loue the Germanes be ambitious, the Frenchmen inconstant, the Spaniardes impacient, the Italians ielous. In hatred the Germans are re∣uengers, the Frenchmen threatners, the Spanyardes continuing in their purpose, and the Italians secret. In af∣faires the Germanes are painefull, the Frenchmen carefull, the Spanyardes wakefull, the Italians circumspect. In Religion and handicraftes the Ger∣manes are excellent aboue other, the Frenchmen in ciuilitie, the Spaniardes in Nauigation, and y<SUP>e</SUP> Italians in lear∣ning. And to bée short, and not to touche
<PB N="42" REF="30"/> euerie perticular poynte in these Nati∣ons, the Italians and Spanyardes are wyse béefore the déede, French∣men in the déede, and Germans after the déede. There is also great difference béetwéene these Nations in the loue of wéemen, for:</P>
<L>The Frenchman loues the nimble wenche▪ that trippes and treades apace,</L>
<L>And aptly footes the measures fine, to daunce with comly grace.</L>
<L>The Spaniarde doth more his minde in bewtie braue delight,</L>
<L>And ioyes withall to please his lust euen with his ladies sight.</L>
<L>Th' Italian, with a fearfull wen∣ches loue is best content,</L>
<L>That often shunnes the pleasant game of loue, least shee be shent.</L>
<L>But shee that with a brasen face her maister can prouoke:</L>
<L>Shee is the loue that in the Ger∣mans hart beares greatest stroke.</L>
<P>These properties, as they are by iudg∣ment of many ascribed vnto the men of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ties of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>weemē.</NOTE> those nations, so are there also peculiar qualities in the wéemen wherein they
<PB N="43" REF="30"/> differ one from another, whether you speake of their stature and forme of bo∣die, gesture, courage, gate, diuerse stu∣dies, loue, faith towards their husbands, diligence towardes theyr Children, hu∣manitie towardes all men: or whether you talke of theyr wittes and vnder∣standing. For the Italian wéemen for the more parte apply the studye of good learning, especially if they bée of any noble familie, which the Spanish wéemen doe not, and the Frenchwée∣men doe more studye the knowledge of forreyne toongues, then of learnyng. The Germane wéemen doe scarce knowe anye other language then their owne whiche they sucked from theyr mothers breastes, much lesse any good learnyng. So the Spanish wéemen are proude in theyr apparell and goyng, the Italian wéemen graue and neate, the Frenchwéemen lyght, the Germane∣wéemē variable and foolish. And vnder∣stand, that I speake héere of the higher Germanie, for the Dutche wéemen are more ciuile, more graue in goyng, and
<PB N="44" REF="31"/> more giuen to learne straunge tongues then of any other nation, by reason of the traficque of Merchādize which much flourisheth among them, hauing Eng∣land, Scotland, Fraunce, and the higher Germany neare neighbors vnto them, and are gouerned by y<SUP>e</SUP> King of Spaine. The Italian wéemen are passing wise, the Spanish wéemen for the more part are dull of wit and vnderstanding, the Frenchwéemen are simple rather by nature then custome, the German wée∣men aplie all their wittes rather vppon houshould affaires, then any thing else. The Spanishe wéemen vse painting to excessiuely to commende their beautie with all, the Italian wéemen vse the same somewhat lesse, the Frenchwée∣men verie little, and the Germane wée∣men painte their faces béefore they bée maried onely, but not all of them, &amp; that which they doe is the to th' intent to de∣ceiue their louers. But as touchinge their honestie: that I commit to other mens iudgement. There is moreouer a certen difference béetwene these Nati∣ons
<PB N="45" REF="31"/> and all other, in those things which wée haue béefore specified, wherby they are discerned from all other Nations, which profiteth very muche to the fra∣ming of a mans iudgement, as the sun∣dry nations of Italians are: <HI>Ligurians, Tuscanes, Spoletanes, Latines, Cam∣panians, Lucans, Calabrians, Salentines Apuliās, Samnites, Marca Anconitans, Flaminians, Aemilians, Lumbards, Ve∣netians, Forli,</HI> and <HI>Slauonians,</HI> &amp; these differ al not only in spéech, proprietie of language, &amp; pronunciacion: but in ma∣ners also, &amp; many other wayes. Which thing, how true it is: <HI>Fortian</HI> questions <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fortian questions.</NOTE> do declare, whervnto whoso ioyneth the booke that was written by one <HI>Landus Hortēsius,</HI> set foorth without any name, hée may bée conuersant among the Ita∣lians with great profit and honour.</P>
<P>Hetherto haue I shewen the causes and effectes of Traueill, and noted the diuersitie of the principall Nations of <HI>Europe.</HI> Hereafter I meane to declare how to know whether a man haue got∣ten any profit by his traueill or not. And
<PB N="46" REF="32"/> although it bée harde to iudge of euery perticular, since diuerse traueill for di∣uerse causes, &amp; some studie one art some another: neuerthelesse who so weigheth diligently the meanes whereby euerie Art is learned, hee may gather it, by ve∣rie playne and euident argumentes. For as no man accoumpteth hym to bée experte in Physicke that hath no know∣ledge in simples: or that hée is a good Carpenter or Caruer, that cannot dis∣cerne a <HI>Doricke</HI> Picture or statue, frō a <HI>Corinthiā:</HI> so nether can it be thought that hée hath well employed hys tyme and labour in traueill which hath not a∣mended and encreased by his traueill, the knowledge and skill which hee had béefore. As for example, if there bée <NOTE PLACE="marg">Preceptes to be obser∣ued.</NOTE> one that is a politicke person, and bée a Counseller to any Prince, or in some frée state, and say that hée hath continued some space in Fraunce: &amp; it bée demaū∣ded of him how many miles Fraunce, or Spaine is in length or breadth? what fortifications it hath? At what syde it is easie or harde to bée assaulted? Howe
<PB N="47" REF="32"/> manie great Riuers it hath that cannot bee waded? What is the chiefe force and vertue of the Spanyardes, and what of the Frenchmen? what is the greatest vice in both nacions? wherin doth the one or the other moste repast themselues, or take greatest delight? In what thinge the nobilitie of Fraunce doth differ from the nobilitie of Spain? wherein also the commons doe dif∣fer of both nacions, what are theire studies, and maners? what diuersitie is béetwéene the buildinges of both those cuntreys? which kinge of ether cuntrie is of greater power? After what maner the subiectes in both cuntreies shewe their obedience to their prince, or oppose themselues against him? How mutch the bondage of Fraunce is vnlike to the bondage of Spaine? How in those re∣gions the scarcitie of corne and vitaill maye bée eschued? what is the guise of Court in doth Realmes? and what prouision is made that in time of warre the Husbandmen sustaine no iniurie? If therfore hée can sufficiently
<PB N="48" REF="33"/> answere these demaūdes, then it is wel: if not, it is a great presumption that hée hath bestowed his time in other mat∣ters rather then by his traueill to know these things which it héehooueth a poli∣ticke person, or a Counseller to vnder∣stand, although ther withall he know al∣so what kind of Dauncing the French∣men, or Spaniardes do vse. For those things are chiefly to bée obserued which tende to the principall ende, not toyes and trifles or such things as appertaine not to the direct ende, although we may also haue some vse of them in other af∣faires. In fine, to conclude much matter in fewe woordes, the most certeine rule to knowe whether a man haue profited by traueiling, is, whether besides the things that I haue recited in this presēt Chapter, you diligently obserue what hée iudgeth in his familiar talke of the landes wherin hée hath traueiled. For hée that vnaduisedly derogateth anye thing from the dignitie and excellencie of forreine regions, without iust cause preferring his natiue Cuntrey béefore
<PB N="49" REF="33"/> those places: the same is ether ruled by affection, or of himself rude and foolishe, not beinge able to iudge of thinges ac∣cordingly. And where discretion lacketh there wanteth also choice: and where choice wanteth there wisdome is foorth a towne, wherwith all other thinges faill, and waxe woorth nothinge.</P>

<P>ALthough it may bée sufficiently con∣ceiued by those thinges which wee haue set downe in the Chapters goyng béefore, what it béehooueth him to ob∣serue that meaneth to Traueyll with profite: notwithstanding I purpose to prosecute euerie thing more exactlye, imitating the example of <HI>Moyses,</HI> who most diligentlye discerned the differen∣ces
<PB N="50" REF="34"/> béetwéene Mountaynes, Hilles, Landes, Peoples, Townes, fieldes and Forestes, adding moreouer what is to bée considered in them all. For thus hee sayde to them whom hee sent to viewe the lande of <HI>Chanaan.</HI> When yée shall come vnto the Hilles, consi∣der the lande what maner one it is, and consyder the people that dwell there∣in, whether they bée stronge or weake: manye or fewe: the Lande good or bad: what Cyties there bee? Walled or not Walled: the soyle fertile or bar∣reine: wooddie or champion? So that there bee fiue principall poyntes too <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fiue poīts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be consi∣dered.</NOTE> bee considered in euerie Cuntrey: the Name, Figure, Bignesse, Iurisdiction, and situation. To the Name belongeth <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nmae</NOTE> howe it was called of olde, and howe at this present, for oftentimes the names of Regions ar changed according to va∣rietie of time, and inhabitauntes. So <HI>Italy</HI> was first called <HI>Ianicula</HI> of <HI>Ianus,</HI> or of <HI>Noa</HI> who was called <HI>Oenotrius</HI> wherof the same was also called <HI>Oeno∣tria:</HI> after that it was named <HI>Camesena,</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="34"/> <HI>Saturnia, Appennina, Taurina,</HI> &amp; <HI>Vi∣tullia, Hesperia</HI> also, and <HI>Ausonia,</HI> vntil at length it was tearmed by the name of <HI>Italia, Italie,</HI> whych remayneth to this presente, the occasions of all which names are partlye noted by <HI>Cato,</HI> and <HI>Berosus,</HI> and partly by suche as haue written the Historie, and described the antiquityes of the same Cuntrey, as <HI>Polybius, Halicarnasseus,</HI> and others. By the Figure I meane the fourme <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fi∣gure.</NOTE> and fashion of the Cuntry. So <HI>Sicile,</HI> is sayde to bée of a three square fourme and <HI>Critias</HI> in <HI>Plato</HI> reporteth of a certeyne <HI>Egiptian</HI> Priest, of whom <HI>So∣lon</HI> demaunded certeine questions con∣cernyng antiquitie, to whom hée an∣swered, that Countrey to bée of a thrée square fourme, out of whose toppe the Streames of <HI>Nilus</HI> are deuided. &amp;c. There is also another distinction of Cuntries, and places. For euery lande, is eyther an Ilande, as <HI>Sicile:</HI> or <HI>Pe∣ninsula,</HI> that is to say, almost an Ilande called also <HI>Chersonesus,</HI> as <HI>Taurica Chersonesus,</HI> now called the lesse <HI>Tar∣taria</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="35"/> or <HI>Isthmus,</HI> that is to say, a narow land béetwéene two Seas, as <HI>Isthmus Corinthiacus, Corinthe</HI> in <HI>Greece,</HI> or else a mayne and continent lande, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <HI>Saxonie, Misnia, Thuring,</HI> as Cosmo∣graphers teache. By Bignesse I vn∣derstande <NOTE PLACE="marg">Signes.</NOTE> the capacitie and widenesse, which is discerned in length and bredth of a Cuntrey: likewise in the compasse, boundes, and buttes, wherwith it is en∣uironed in respect of the Coastes of the world, and Peoples, Riuers, or Hilles wherevpon it bordereth. By Iuris∣diction <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iurisdic∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion.</NOTE> vnderstande, the rule, and maner of gouernment which is in that Lande which being diuerse amōg diuerse peo∣ples, and belonging rather to euery pri∣uate prouince or peculiar citie, then vn∣to whole regions: I meane to entreate of the differences of them hereafter in this Chapter. The situation of a Coun∣trey is eyther hillie or plaine, and the same againe either coasting, or inlande. Which diuersitie tooke beginning euen from verie nature, and bringeth with it sundry great commodities. For as the
<PB N="53" REF="35"/> same Priest in <HI>Plato</HI> teacheth: they that dwell vppon the toppes of the hilles are safe from fluddes, and drowning: and there is also an auncient conten∣tion béetwéene the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> and <HI>Scythians</HI> concerning antiquitie, for that the <HI>Scythians</HI> saye they were first made, who dwelling in the higher places: are best able to abide the Colde, and stande not in feare that the Sunne set them on fiere, nor dreade the brea∣kyng in of the Sea vppon them, bée∣ing neuer able to rise vp vnto them to theyr anoyance. In the former Bookes <HI>De Republica,</HI> a certen <HI>Athenian</HI> asked a man of <HI>Crete</HI> (who had saide that the greater parte of the <HI>Cretens,</HI> had de∣termyned to make a <HI>Colonie</HI> abroade, and had commited the charge thereof to the <HI>Gnosij)</HI> whether that <HI>Colonie</HI> shoulde lye vpon the Sea side, or not. &amp;c. There bée also other diuersyties bée∣twéene Regions, or soyle, and earth, all whyche <HI>Leuinus Lemnius</HI> the Dutch∣man, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Leuinus Lemnius</NOTE> hath lately vttred in his woorke which he hath set foorth of the secret mi∣racles
<PB N="54" REF="36"/> of nature. And those thynges whiche wée haue hetherto admoni∣shed in this Chapter to bée obserued by Traueilers, hath <HI>Franciscus Patri∣tius Senensis</HI> also noted in his woorke, of the Institution of a Kinge and a Kingdome. But wée must vnderstand, that it is not sufficient to haue mar∣ked the differences of the letters, and woordes: vnlesse wée note also the ground or soile, Hilles, Riuers, Lakes, Ponds, woods, &amp; the cities also in them. For some ground is barrein some fruit∣ful, which <HI>Moses</HI> willed his Surueiers to marke, which also the <HI>Athenian</HI> in <HI>Plato</HI> teacheth. So likewise some hilles brynge foorthe trees and some doe not, some ryuers abounde with fishe &amp; some not. And most sure it is, that the <HI>Ge∣noans</HI> are muche destitute of these two thinges. The like also is to bée iud∣ged of wooddes, Lakes, and standyng Pondes, who for the diuersitie of trées and fyshes that are in them: are accu∣stomably praysed or dispraysed of Rhe∣tricians. The viewing of Cityes re∣quyreth
<PB N="55" REF="36"/> muche more diligence, for in them there are both publique, and pri∣nate woorkes to bée séene. Publique woorkes bée eyther holye, or profane. The holye woorkes are Cathedrall Churches, Minsters, Abbeis, and o∣ther Churches, wherof althoughe there bée some founde verye fayre manye tymes out of Cities: yet are they more commonlye in Cyties then in Vil∣lagies. The profane workes are pallai∣ces, Market places, fieldes, Theaters, Courtes, Schooles, Hospitals, Spittles for sick &amp; diseased persons, Castles, Ar∣maries, bulwarkes, turrets, &amp; all kinde of municion. Priuate woorkes I call such notable thinges as are séene in the houses of priuate men, and citizens, as Pictures, Gardaines, Fountaynes, or whatsoeuer else is worth y<SUP>e</SUP> seing, wher∣vnto also maye Potecaties Shoppes bée anexed, since for the most part they are priuate mens goods, as lybraries are the common wealthes, Howbeit it maye bee, that they may bothe bée∣long to the Princes reuenue, as bathes
<PB N="56" REF="37"/> doe, wyth many other things moe. And like as when we enter into considerati∣on of any Cuntrey, aboue althing it be∣hooueth vs to know the name thereof, &amp; the cause of the name if it bée possible to knowe it: so muste wée doe also in the viewe of any Citie. So at <HI>Ianua</HI> in a certen Citizens house, these verses fol∣lowing are written vpon the name, and founder of that Citie.</P>
<L>I Ianus, of religion, of peace, and God of right,</L>
<L>Am he of old that built this citie braue that standes in sight.</L>
<L>These three shall keepe the towne and (nephues) keepe these three in hand,</L>
<L>Beleeue mee where these three shalbe exild, no towne can stand.</L>
<P>And immediatly after: <HI>Phetiton</HI> ne∣phue to <HI>Ianus,</HI> father to <HI>Ligurius,</HI> who brought y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Egiptiā</HI> Colonies frō <HI>Attica</HI> to y<SUP>e</SUP> citie of <HI>Ianua,</HI> in the yeare after the fludde 450. Thus when wee haue vn∣derstoode the name and founder of y<SUP>e</SUP> Ci∣tie, wee must next haue regarde to the maner of gouernment. For there is one
<PB N="57" REF="37"/> maner of lyuing vnder a Monarchie, as <NOTE PLACE="marg">Diuersitie of gouer∣ment.</NOTE> in Spayne, and in Fraunce: another in <HI>Aristocratie,</HI> as now in <HI>Venice,</HI> and in old time in <HI>Sparta:</HI> another in <HI>Demo∣cratie,</HI> wherwith y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Switchers</HI> preserue their lybertie and cuntrey at this daye. And although all Philosophers and stu∣dients of pollice, suppose that al kinds of gouerment may bee comprehended vn∣der one of these thrée, if the abuse as well as the right vse of them be weigh∣ed: yet experience teacheth it to be o∣therwise. For there be certen cuntries, Realmes, and Cities at this present, whiche are gouerned by the Kinge and the Nobillitie together, as <HI>Denmarke:</HI> and as it was likewise at <HI>Rome</HI> in the time of the Kings vnto the <HI>Tarquines:</HI> some by the King and commonaltie, as <HI>Persia:</HI> some by the Nobilitie and com∣monalty, as <HI>Florence, Siene,</HI> and diuers other Cities of <HI>Italie,</HI> the lyke whereof was practized at <HI>Rome</HI> after the expul∣sion of the Kinges, at <HI>Lacedaemon,</HI> and <HI>Athens:</HI> finally, some are gouerned by the Kinge, Nobylitie, and cōmonaltye,
<PB N="58" REF="38"/> as Germanie, and Polande. Which be∣ing knowne: wée must marke how in euery kinde of gouerment, the Empire is ether continued, or increased, or lost: and with what new lawes, officers, and Maiestrates, they vse to furnishe them∣selues when they perceaue their state to bée in perill. Which poyncte how full of difficultie it is: euery one knoweth, séeing as <HI>Cicero</HI> saith, it is the part of a straunger not to bee inquisitiue in a strange place, and not to be curious in a forraine common wealth. But truly he that studieth to doo his Cuntrey good, must néedes doo so. Last of all he muste bée very well acquainted with the ma∣ners <NOTE PLACE="marg">The ma∣ners.</NOTE> and conditions of the men with whom he lyueth: not to the intent onely to aplye himselfe vnto them in that re∣specte: but also in diet and apparell, and all their maner of lyuing, or whatsoeuer perticular thinge there be that may in∣struct him in language, or behauiour, or help his iudgment, or serue him enie way y<SUP>t</SUP> may be profitable vnto mākind.</P>
<P>I knowe there bée some that wyll
<PB N="59" REF="38"/> say that these thinges whiche I gyue in precept, are for the more part friuolous, since there is no one man that can ob∣serue all thinges, muchlesse he that ge∣ueth himselfe wholy to some profession, or studieth some other thing, for whiche he hath traueiled. I graunt it is true, nether writte I this to the ende that I woulde haue all men to obserue all of them, for a man must spende more time in one thing then in another, whiche I haue noted also before: notwithstand∣inge, whosoeuer hath traueiled for stu∣dies sake or for any other cause, maye somtime be so much at leasure, as to ob∣serue some other thinges that are profi∣table, and commodius for the societie of men. And albeit diuers things may bée necessary for diuers persōs, according to y<SUP>e</SUP> end which euery one proposeth to him self, &amp; y<SUP>e</SUP> frute which he hopeth to reap of his traueil: notw<SUP>t</SUP>standing I thinke this our writing wilbe vnto some right pro∣fitable. For why? our precepts ar gene∣ral, &amp; may be applied vnto al trauel, whe thersoeuer, but chefly to y<SUP>e</SUP> which is takē
<PB N="60" REF="39"/> in hande for matter of state and polli∣cie, and which maketh men méete and fit to geue counsell, and to gouerne the common wealth. Who so hath propo∣sed himselfe any other ende, as a Phy∣sition, a Souldiour, or Merchant: hee may omit certen of these, &amp; place other in theyr stéede. And it shalbe more pro∣fitable, that euery one weigh with him∣selfe the knowledge of what things wil most farther hym towardes the attayn∣ment of that for whiche hee traueileth. For hee that so doth, shall receiue largest commoditie thereof, and soo∣nest hit the marke whereat he shooteth, what euer trade of lyfe hée foloweth.</P>

<HEAD>¶ <HI>How wee ought to make a Choyce of suche</HI> thinges as wee see or learne <HI>in traueilling: and of the</HI> Tra∣ueillers Priuileges.</HEAD>
<HEAD><HI>The</HI> 6. <HI>Chapter.</HI></HEAD>
<P>YOungemen that traueill, muste bée admonished of this one thinge, that whilst they bée viewing althing, search∣inge, and learninge, they bée also mind∣full of their retourninge into their owne Cuntreye. For they that doo not so, they liue but for one daye, as the Prouerbe sayeth, and are but litle prouident for their owne welfare. For since in all places of the Worlde there are found both good and éeuell men, and there is no Nation so relygious and ci∣uile but hath some vices also adioyned vnto the vertues wherewith it is indu∣ed: so are the greatest and most hainous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ownde amongest them that abounde
<PB N="62" REF="40"/> with most commendable vertues. For séeinge that good and éeuell stande in op∣position and contrarietie one to the o∣ther: it followeth y<SUP>t</SUP> one of them holde vp and sustayne another, and that the one cannot bee without the other, as what place were there for Iustice if there were no iniuries? for Magnanimitie if there were no fainthartinesse? for con∣tinencie if there were no lustinge nor intemperauncie? for health, if ther were no sickly persons? for truth if ther wer no lyes? for felicytie if there were no miserie? That <HI>Socrates</HI> in <HI>Plato</HI> sayde very well, how he much marueiled that <HI>Esope</HI> deuised neuer a fable, wherein God ioined the extremities of these con∣traries together in such maner that one touched the other, and the ende of one were the beginning of another. Wher∣fore, it behoueth a traueiller to bee cir∣cumspect that hée embrace not vices in stéede of vertues, not onely in that wée bée all more prone by Nature to vice then vertue: but bicause vices are often couered with names of the nearest ver∣tues,
<PB N="63" REF="40"/> and vertues also stayned with title of next vices. As for example, when wée call a man that vseth his ly∣bertie arregant: a modest man simple, one of fewe wordes ignoraunt: a good man wicked: a wise man craftye: the lyke whereof happeneth also in o∣ther thinges. And manytimes plea∣sures make a man not thinke on hys returne, wherewith mannie are tought as Fishes with a hooke, vnto whiche effecte those Meremaides are of much force, by whose swéete songes sundrye are intrapped vnlesse they stop their eares well againste their hermo∣nie: there bée also infinite other allure∣mentes accordinge to the diuersitie of the Cuntrey. To these also this often happneth, that there are some forreine People so craftie and suttle, that when they perceaue a man to bée enamoured with their pleasures, they leaue no meanes vnassaid to detaine him lenger with them: chaunginge themselues into all fourmes and figures after the maner of <HI>Protheus,</HI> both to cosin hym
<PB N="64" REF="41"/> of his money, and as <HI>Circe</HI> did to <HI>Vlis∣ses</HI> mates, transforme him from a man to a beast. Wherefore, if therebe neede of wisdome in any thing: surely it née∣deth in this, which <HI>Homere</HI> also signy∣sieth in many places in the <HI>Odissea</HI> vn∣der the person of <HI>Vlisses.</HI> For such is the ignorance of mans vnderstandinge, the vntowardnes of his corrupt nature so great: that hée cannot discerne good from éeuel, vertue from vice, with out difficultie. And although wée graunt, that some offend wittingly, and deceiue themselues with the couloure of true pleasure or payne, as those doo that bée incontinent, whose minde and reason <NOTE PLACE="marg">Incontinēt persons.</NOTE> while it striueth with desire iudgeth that to bée éeuell, which in trueth is ée∣uell: howbeit they want the perfecte knowledge, not iudginge so exquisitely as they ought, and indéede are caryed a∣way rather with opinion then iudge∣ment, so sufferinge their reasons to bee ruled by affection. For doubtlesse if they knewe the trueth as it is: they should not erre. Thus desire ouercum∣meth
<PB N="65" REF="41"/> reason with ignoraunce, and true knowledge is neuer ouercum by affec∣tion. But howsoeuer the case standeth, there is nothing better for a Traueiler then to bridle his lustes and affection himself, if hée be able. If not, the nexte is to vse the meanes and help of others, followinge the precepte of <HI>Hesiodus.</HI> Which <HI>Homere</HI> lykewise expresseth in the example of <HI>Vlisses,</HI> feininge that hee stopped his mates eares with waxe, that they shuld not be entised with sing∣ing of the <HI>Sirenes.</HI> But hée that will doo nether of these twayne, hee voluntarely séeketh his owne harme, &amp; casteth him∣selfe headlong into all kind of lewdnes. And as touching repressinge his affecti∣ons: he shall doo it more easely and wil∣lingly, if hée think often of returning in∣to his cuntrey: as <HI>Homere</HI> writeth <HI>V∣lisses</HI> dyd, &amp; by this meanes through his owne discretion he may withstande the allurements of sundry pleasures, &amp; get the victory ouer all kind of naughtiues. There is an auntient complaint made by many that our cuntreymen vsually
<PB N="66" REF="42"/> bringe thrée thinges with them out of <HI>Italye:</HI> a naughty conscience, an empty <NOTE PLACE="marg">Three <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hinges out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Italie.</NOTE> Purse, and a weake stomacke: and many times it chaunceth so indéede. But what is the cause thereof? for in those places of <HI>Italie</HI> where the studye of good Artes doth moste flourishe, the Aire is not vnholsome, the dyet such as euery man doth require, the men godly and vngodly, good and bad. There are séene also dayly many examples of ver∣tues and vices, in all sortes of men. It remayneth therfore, that the same hap∣neth by our owne voluntarye will and méere motion, that we liue so y<SUP>t</SUP> béeinge snared in y<SUP>e</SUP> toyles of vices wée sustaine los of godlynesse, health, &amp; monie, that it is growen into a prouerbe amonge the <HI>Italians, Thedesco Italionato, Diabo∣lo incarnato:</HI> that is to saye, a Dutch∣man become in maners lyke an <HI>Italian</HI> putteth on the nature of the Deuill, and is apt vnto all kinde of wickednesse. Euerye Nation hath his peculiare vi∣ces which it béehooueth vs to know, but not to followe. To conclude we must so
<PB N="67" REF="42"/> line among forrein Nacions that when we returne home wée may frequent our owne Cuntrey guise if it bée good, not bringe home with vs vices for ver∣tues, ignorance for knowledge, naugh∣tines for goodnes, opinion for certentie, sicknes for health, or whatsoeuer els is wicked &amp; execrable, both w<SUP>t</SUP> losse of time, and expense of money, and so to returne home with shame, and shame enough.</P>
<P>And forasmuch as there bée manye and diuers anoiāces, wherat traueilers must make small curtesie: therfore are there many benefits and priuiledges by both lawes graunted vnto them. For strangers and traueilers a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>compted in the number of the Church and spiratu∣altie, and whoso hurteth them or their goods: are excomunicated, vnlesse when they be admonished thereof they make satisfaction. Likewise they that traueill <NOTE PLACE="marg">Priuiled∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ueilers.</NOTE> for religions sake are frée from payinge skot or lot. And all traueilers and stran∣gers haue frée lybertye to béequeath their goodes at their pleasure: and if a∣ny chaunce to die intestate, their goodes
<PB N="68" REF="43"/> which they haue brought w<SUP>t</SUP> them shall not appertayne to hym in whose house they lie, but they come to the Byshop of the same diocesse, either to bée deliuered vnto the next hèires, or to bée employd to godlye purposes. But if it chaunce that the Host detayne any of these goods <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ertune of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ods pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ibited.</NOTE> in his handes fraudulentlye, he is com∣pelled to restore thréefold so much to the Byshop, enie custome to the contrarye notwithstandinge, or else he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eseth the lybertie to make a testament, yea, who soeuer kéepeth away any parte of the straungers goodes that die, hée sinneth mortally, vnlesse he doo it to th' intent to deliuer them to the true heire, and is not to be excused by any statute, custome, or commaundement, as <HI>Hostiensis</HI> proo∣ueth at large. Moreouer, such as traueil for relligiōs sake, ought not to be trou∣bled or st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d for det in any place through which they traueil, nor to bée takē by oc∣casion or meanes of y<SUP>t</SUP> which Lawiers call stoppinge or re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h. Likewise, along iourny, takē in hand for matter of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cessitie, may defer mariage. Last of all,
<PB N="69" REF="43"/> y<SUP>e</SUP> law hath also prouided for those y<SUP>e</SUP> tra∣ueil for studie sake. There is extant al∣so a constitution made by <HI>Frederick</HI> the Emperour, in <HI>Iustinians Code,</HI> where∣in hée graunteth vnto all that traueill to study: safecondit to traueill, and frée ly∣bertie to tary in any place, forbiddinge that in no wise they be troubled for the offence or det of another: permittinge them to choose béefore what iudge they wilbée conuented, shewing also the cau∣ses why it ought to be so. Wee must al∣so <NOTE PLACE="marg">Friendly Priuileges.</NOTE> vnderstand that Schollars goods are exempted frō payments and exactions. Which point although it bée not expres∣sed in this constitution: yet by these words <HI>(Let them freely come and dwell)</HI> and by many other argumentes moe interpretours do gather the same. And this whole constitution is to bee vnder∣stoode of such Scholers as studye, and not of those whose skill and minde is more on their dishes then their Books, although their names be written in the Matricular bookes of studients, as they tearme it, by the testimony of publique
<PB N="70" REF="44"/> Notaries, and Apparitours. But this constitution is not written concerninge all Schooles, but only of such as are ap∣proued by thaucthoritie of great Prin∣ces, or longe continuance, as <HI>Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olus</HI> hath noted. There are extant also many titles of priuiledges belonging to Scol∣lars in y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Code</HI> writen in the time of the auntient Lawiers, as of the Priuiled∣ges of Schooles in the x. Booke. Like∣wise, of the professours of the Citie of <HI>Constantinople:</HI> in the xii. Booke. And at this present there bée sundrye noble Vniuersities of studentes, endued with many goodly Priuiledges giuen by the Byshoppes of <HI>Rome,</HI> Emperours and other Princes, with <HI>Franciscus Bolog∣ninus</HI> hath gathered together.</P>

<P>HEtherto wée haue sufficientlye in∣treated of such things as apperteine to the declaration of y<SUP>e</SUP> definition of Tra¦ueill: let vs nowe therefore recite some examples of such men, as haue gotten themselues great commendacion &amp; glo∣rie by traueill. And although this place bée more copious then that it may bee comprised in fewe wordes, for who is able to examine all men of all states and condicion whatsoeuer? not withstanding I wyll bringe foorth the most notable examples of the most ex∣cellēt men in sundrie kinds of life. And <NOTE PLACE="marg">Philoso∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hers.</NOTE> to begin with Philosophers, it is well knowne, y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Pythagoras</HI> went first into <HI>Egipt,</HI> there to learne of the priestes of that cuntry the vertu of numbers, &amp; the
<PB N="72" REF="45"/> moste exquisite figures of <HI>Geometrie.</HI> From thence to <HI>Babilon,</HI> where of the <HI>Chaldes</HI> hée learned the course of the Planets, their stations, circuit, and ef∣fects, ouer these inferiour bodies. Then goynge backe into <HI>Crete</HI> how he came to <HI>Lacedaemon,</HI> to vnderstand the most famous lawes which flourished at that time, made by <HI>Lycurgus</HI> and <HI>Minos.</HI> Lastlye, arriuinge in <HI>Italie:</HI> how hee remayned at the citie of <HI>Croton</HI> the space of twenty yéeres, where by hys aucthoryty he reclaymed the people that were woont to lyue in all dissolutnesse, bringing them to a frugale trade of life the Matrones to chastitie, the youth to modesty, insomuch y<SUP>e</SUP> the wéemen being mooued with his holynesse and vertue: left of their golden Garmentes, &amp; other excesse of furniture and Ornamentes which they were woont to were conse∣crating thē vnto <HI>Iuno.</HI> At the lēgth how hée sayled to <HI>Metapentū,</HI> and there died where hee was had in such admiration: that they made a Church of his house, and offered Diuine Sacrifice vnto
<PB N="73" REF="45"/> him. And whether traueiled not also <HI>A∣pollonius</HI> his Scholer? Beyng a Ma∣giciā, and a Philosopher? he passed ouer <HI>Caucasus,</HI> he went through the <HI>Albani, Scythians, Massagetes</HI> the most weal∣thiest Realmes of <HI>India,</HI> and passyng ouer the broade ryuer <HI>Phison,</HI> came to the <HI>Brachmannj</HI> to heare <HI>Hiarchas</HI> sit∣ting in his throne of Golde, and drin∣king of <HI>Tantalus</HI> well, amonge a few<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Schollers, dispute of the Nature and motions of the Planetes, and of the in∣equalitie of the dayes. From thēce how hée traueiling by the <HI>Elamites, Babilo∣nians, Chaldees, Medes, Assyrians, Parthians, Syrians, Phoenicians, Ara∣bians, Iewes,</HI> returning to <HI>Alexandria:</HI> departed into <HI>Aethiopia</HI> to heare the <HI>Gymnosophistes,</HI> and to béehold y<SUP>t</SUP> most renoumed table of the Sunne, standing <NOTE PLACE="marg">The tab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of y<SUP>e</SUP> Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></NOTE> vppon the Sea beache rightly being of opinion, y<SUP>t</SUP> a man may learne somwhat in euery place, and better himself wher∣soeuer he becommeth.

Moreouer hée traueilled into <HI>Aegypt,</HI> to learne antiquities of the wise men of that lande: from whence there is no doubt, but hée brought all the wis∣dome and knowledge which hée lefte to posteritie, &amp; in which he excelled in such fort, that in respect therof he was called <HI>Diuine,</HI> &amp; Prince of Philosophers. It is not necessarye to recyte manye moe of this sort, eyther more auncient thē these or of latter yéeres, béeyng euident that all they haue done the lyke whosoeuer are commended for renowne, and lear∣ning. And vnlesse they had done so: they could not haue drawne vnto them∣selues such flockes of schollers, nor haue raysed so many S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctes, as <HI>Socrates</HI> the <HI>Socraticke, Plato</HI> the <HI>Academick, Ari∣stotle</HI> the <HI>Peripateticke, Zeno</HI> the <HI>Stoicke, Pythagoras</HI> the <HI>Pythagorick, Antistenes</HI> the <HI>Cynicke, Aristippus</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="46"/> the <HI>Cyrenaicke,</HI> and other lykewyse others. The lyke is also in Phisitions, whether wée speake of Greekes or <HI>A∣rabicks.</HI> For that I may say nothing of <HI>Aesculapius,</HI> whom in the old tyme they feygned to bée God of Physick: it is cer∣teyne that <HI>Hyppocrates</HI> dyd not onely <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hypocra∣tes.</NOTE> practyze his arte at home: but also in forreyne Cuntryes For hée dwelt ma∣nie yéeres in <HI>Thessalia,</HI> being borne in <HI>Coos,</HI> &amp; being sent for to <HI>Abdera,</HI> draue away the pestilence from that city.

And first he went to <HI>Alexan∣dria,</HI> where when hee had stayed some space, and wandred ouer all the lande of <HI>Egypt</HI> lying round about: hee departed
<PB N="76" REF="47"/> vnto <HI>Palaestina</HI> in <HI>Syria.</HI> Hée sayled to <HI>Lemnos</HI> and <HI>Cyprus,</HI> to th'intent to bring sundrie thinges from thence ser∣uing to the vse of Phisicke, to doe hys Cuntreymen of <HI>Pergamum</HI> pleasure withall.

The <HI>Arabian</HI> Phisitions also were no lesse giuen to traueile, as <HI>Auicen</HI> witnesseth of himselfe, that hée had welnigh traueiled ouer all y<SUP>e</SUP> world. What shall I speake of Oratours and Poetes? whose nature is properly, to traueill as <HI>Plato</HI> beareth recorde: and their duetie requireth them to doe so, to maintaine common tranquilitie, or for any other cause, which poinct is also cō∣man vnto all ciuill and politicke persons

For while they traueil abroade, and looke diligently to their du∣tie, other Citizens may tarie at home, and the common wealth be in quietnes: which innumerable examples bothe of <HI>Greeke,</HI> and <HI>Latine</HI> Histories do teach, both in <HI>Thucidides,</HI> and <HI>Liuie.</HI></P>
<P>Howbeit now at the last, let vs exa∣mine the auncient lawe makers &amp; first founders of ceremonies, as <HI>Moyses</HI> that brought lawes vnto the <HI>Iewes</HI> written in tables of stone with Gods owne fin∣ger: lykewise <HI>Orpheus</HI> which dyd the like vnto the <HI>Thracians: Minos,</HI> &amp; <HI>Rha∣damantus</HI> to the <HI>Cretens: Zamolx</HI> is to the <HI>Scythians: Lycurgus</HI> to the <HI>Lacedae∣monians:</HI> and <HI>Draco,</HI> with <HI>Solon,</HI> who prescribed lawes and order of liuing to the people of <HI>Athens.</HI> Surely wee shall finde that they had all traueiled. But if wée will weigh the Lawgiuers of one common wealth onely, as namely of the Citie of <HI>Rome,</HI> they will bring vs forth example enoughe who haue described their liues at large: wherein the presi∣dent of one onely shall suffice vs in the
<PB N="78" REF="48"/> stéede of many, &amp; that is of <HI>P. Seruilius Sulpitius Ruffus.</HI> For it is wel known, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ser.

For in those troublesome dayes hée a∣bode som space at <HI>Samos,</HI> &amp; in other pla∣ces, disputing in the Schooles, of the Pontificial lawe. But when <HI>Caesar</HI> re∣turned into <HI>Italie,</HI> hée was not onely re∣stored into y<SUP>e</SUP> Citie, but also made Liue∣tenaunt of <HI>Greece</HI> as long as <HI>Caesar</HI> ly∣ued: but when he was slain, he returned to <HI>Rome.</HI> Finally, if wée peruse y<SUP>e</SUP> lyues of interpretours of the Law, both new and olde, wée shall finde that there haue bin manie moe strangers haue taught, and professed the Civile Lawe in anye place, thē of them that were borne there in the same Cuntrey. The truth wher∣of is yet to bée séene in <HI>Italie, Germa∣nie,</HI> and <HI>Fraunce,</HI> where the Ciuile law
<PB N="79" REF="48"/> is in price. For there bee many Real∣mes that vse theyr owne Municipall or Countrie lawes onely, not the <HI>Ro∣mane,</HI> as <HI>England, Scotland, Polande,</HI> and <HI>Sueueland:</HI> which lawes, none can interprete better then hée that is borne and bred vnder them.</P>
<P>Yea, noble mē likewise, &amp; such as haue done worthy and valient déedes, haue also bin addicted to trauel. For it is wri∣tē, that <HI>Iupiter Cretaeus</HI> traueiled ouer <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iup. Cre∣taeus.</NOTE> the whole world fiuetimes. Which al∣though it may haply séeme fabulous vn∣to some: yet it importeth thus muche, wherby we may vnderstand that at his time he left no part of y<SUP>e</SUP> world vnsought The like whereof also was done by his two Sunnes, that is to wit, <HI>Dionisius</HI> surnamed <HI>Bacchus,</HI> and y<SUP>t</SUP> most valient <HI>Hercules,</HI> the one of them profiring the whole worlde by his inuention, tea∣ching men how to plant vines: y<SUP>e</SUP> other deliuering the earth from all kinde of wicked men, and tyrannie. For what other were <HI>Procustes, Scyron, Cacus, Diomedes, Antaeus,</HI> &amp; <HI>Geryō:</HI> but cruel
<PB N="80" REF="49"/> and wicked tyrantes, who euermore in all places were encountred by <HI>Hercu∣les, Theseus,</HI> and other valiant persona∣ges? It is no vnknowne howe <HI>Iason,</HI> with other maies of that famous expe∣dition, called <HI>Argonautae,</HI> sayled into <HI>Colchos,</HI> of purpose to fetch from thence the Golden fleese: which in déede he at∣chiued, getting vnto himself therby im∣mortall glory.

How∣beit the excellencie of their courage, and the desire of greater glory, pricked them for the to forsake no paynes nor daun∣gers so that they might obtayne that
<PB N="81" REF="49"/> which they sought for.</P>
<P>Let vs moreouer consider al the Mo∣narchies of the world, and wée shal per∣ceaue that the Princes that ruled in them, atchieued most excellent exployts by traueilling, as <HI>Ninus</HI> &amp; <HI>Nabucadne∣zer</HI> in the first Monarchie: <HI>Cyrus, Da∣rius</HI> and <HI>xerxes</HI> in the second: and <HI>A∣lexander</HI> the great in the thirde, with whom also that Monarchie began and ended. For after his death, the king∣domes which hée left were gouerned by many, howbeit they also maintayned great warres in sundry places. In the fouerth, <HI>Iulius Caesar, Octauianus Au∣gustus, Constantines, Charleses, O∣thoes, Conrades, Henries, Fredericks</HI> and other moe, vnto whom all, Lorde <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth was inferiour in no respect, ether for trauellynge, or glo∣rye in chiuaulrie. For how often hath he gone to visite the Realmes that came to hym by discent from his auncetours, lying wide among many Nacions, and as it were dispersed? How often hath he returned conquerour out of France,
<PB N="28" REF="50"/> and gone to his owne realmes? Did not hée, leauing the most flourishinge real∣mes <NOTE PLACE="marg">Prayse of Charles the fyfth.</NOTE> of Spaine, appeace all <HI>Italy</HI> with his presence, that had bin manye yéeres vexed with ciuile war, and also preser∣ued <HI>Germanie</HI> beinge sick almost of the same disease? when hée came towardes <HI>Pannonia,</HI> did not <HI>Solyman</HI> emperour of the Turkes, immediatly run away? Did not hée, beinge present in person, recouer the kingdome of <HI>Tunetz,</HI> a re∣alme in <HI>Africa,</HI> which <HI>Ariadenus Bar∣barossa</HI> had inuaded by commaunde∣ment, and with the power of <HI>Solyman?</HI> went not hee to <HI>Aphrodisium</HI> in hope to succour y<SUP>t</SUP> Christian commonwealth. To be short, to what kingdomes or pla∣ces went not hée? what dangers, what labours sustayned he not? wherby as I haue shewed, hee might purchase peace and tranquilytie to the Empire y<SUP>t</SUP> was committed to his charge, a most excel∣lent prince, and as <HI>Voerthusius</HI> sayth, in al poynts lyke to <HI>Charles</HI> the maine.

So likewise <HI>An∣tiochus</HI> the great, was well traueiled, and <HI>Hannibal, Pompeius,</HI> the <HI>Scipios,</HI> the <HI>Marij, Lentuli,</HI> with other Kinges, Princes, &amp; noble men innumerable of al cuntries: whose vertues &amp; most vali∣ent déedes, shal neuer any obliuion put out of memorie: like as there is no age y<SUP>e</SUP> will cōmend of those that lye sleaping at home, giuen to slouth and idlenes, ne∣uer doing any thing at home or abroad, worthy of praise or speach of posteritie, according to the example of <HI>Ninias,</HI> sun to <HI>Ninus</HI> and <HI>Semiramis, Sardanapalus</HI> with others.</P>
<P>But let vs nowe peruse the holye Scriptures, and in them we shal finde infinite examples of godlie men that haue traueilled, partly of their owne ac∣cord, partly at y<SUP>t</SUP> cōmandement of God.
<PB N="48" REF="51"/> For in the xii. of <HI>Genesis,</HI> God expresly commaundeth <HI>Abraham,</HI> that leauyng the Cuntrey where he dwelt, he should go to an other place: and shortly after, hée promyseth to the same <HI>Abraham,</HI> the land of his traueill, and to geue hym al the land of <HI>Chanaan</HI> for an euerlas∣ting inheritance. Likewise <HI>Isaac,</HI> after the death of his father departed into <HI>Pa∣lestine</HI> and dwelt there, being comaun∣ded by God so to doe. <HI>Iacob,</HI> his father being a liue: traueiled into <HI>Mesopota∣mia,</HI> and after many yéeres returned thence into his natiue cuntrey. And be∣yng well stroken in yéeres, he traueiled into <HI>Aegipt</HI> to sée his sunne <HI>Ioseph:</HI> and in sundry places of the Scripture wee reade, how the holy Patriarches, Pro∣phetes, and other godly men, tooke long viogies in hand, namely, <HI>Moyses, Aa∣ron</HI> and <HI>Iosua.</HI> Yea, our sauiour Christ himselfe, traueilled abroade very often, appearyng many times in semblant of a Pilgrim and Traueiller, to th'intent hée might gather his Churche from e∣uery place. The lyke whereof hee
<PB N="85" REF="51"/> wrought also by his Apostles, whom he sent ouer the whole worlde to preache the Gospell. To whiche purpose it is writen, that <HI>Thomas</HI> traueilled into <HI>Parthia</HI> and preached vnto the inhaby∣tants there, also to the <HI>Medes, Persians, Hircanes, Bactrianes,</HI> and other nacions of the inner <HI>India Mathew,</HI> to the <HI>Ma∣cedonians,</HI> and <HI>Thracians.

Hée declareth how after that hee was conuerted vnto the faith, hée traueiled into <HI>Arabia,</HI> &amp; from thence returned to <HI>Damascus,</HI> and went to <HI>Ierusalem</HI> to sée <HI>Peter.</HI> After that, hée departed into <HI>Syria,</HI> and <HI>Cilicia,</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="52"/> and when fourtéene yéeres were expy∣red: went agayne to <HI>Hierusalem</HI> to preach the Gospell. It is well knowne moreouer that hee was in <HI>Spaine,</HI> and in <HI>Hispania Narbonensis</HI> conuerted many soules to the faith of Christ, as he also did in other places, vntill at last hee was beheaded at <HI>Rome</HI> vnder the Em∣perour <HI>Nero.</HI> Duringe all this time of traueill, the Euangelist S. Luke, was companion to Paule, a Syrian borne, in the Citie of <HI>Antioche,</HI> and wrat his Gospell in <HI>Achaia,</HI> and died in the same cuntry. Likewise S. Marke the Euan∣gelist was borne in the citie of <HI>Antioch</HI> sayled to <HI>Rome,</HI> from whence traueil∣lyng to <HI>Alexandria</HI> to teach the gospell there: hée conuerted the inhabitantes of <HI>Aquileia</HI> now called <HI>Algar</HI> neare bor∣derers, vnto the faith of Christ, and was enstauled their Byshop. Touchinge the other two Euangelists, the matter is e∣uident enough to bée séene in the liues of the Apostles. No les also the fathers, that is to saye, the interpretours of the holy Scripture, were affectioned to tra∣ueill
<PB N="87" REF="52"/> as well as other men, which is al∣so apparant by their liues, as in y<SUP>e</SUP> liues of <HI>Ierome,</HI> and <HI>Augustine.</HI> For <HI>Ierome</HI> being borne at <HI>Stridon</HI> a Citie in <HI>Pan∣nonia,</HI> learned straunge toongues at <HI>Rome:</HI> and went afterward into <HI>Syria,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Bethlaëm,</HI> wher hée died in the 91. yeare of his age, as some haue writen. To conclude, it is most certenlye knowne, that all that euer were of any great aucthoritie, know∣lege, learning, or wisedom since the be∣ginning of the world vnto this present: haue geuen themselues to traueill, and that there was neuer man that perfor∣med any great thinge, or atchieued any notable exploit, vnlesse hée had traueil∣led.</P>

<HEAD>¶ <HI>Of such matter as is commonly obiected</HI> a∣gainst Traueilers, with <HI>a confutation thereof.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD><HI>The.</HI> 8. <HI>Chapter.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BUt there are some y<SUP>t</SUP> much embase traueilling, deterring men frō it ma∣ny waies. These holde opinion that the name of Traueillyng is not only infa∣mous, but also the thing it selfe: which they proue out of certen places of <HI>Tully,</HI> and of <HI>Vlpian</HI> the Lawyer. For in the <HI>Thusculane Questions, Tullie</HI> compareth banishment with Traueill, and in an Epistle to <HI>Caelius,</HI> hée emba∣seth Traueill, terminge it reprochfull, and filthy. And <HI>Vlpain</HI> calleth it <HI>Depor¦tation,</HI> a tearme of the law, being a pu∣nishmēt, wherin a man both looseth his goodes, is disfrauched his citie, and is a∣pointed certen limits within which hée shall dwell and abide. After this maner
<PB N="89" REF="53"/> the Poet <HI>Ouid,</HI> was exiled vnto the ci∣tie of <HI>Tomos</HI> in <HI>Pontus,</HI> léesing the be∣nefit of the citie, and all his goods being excheated. Quer this, they obiect that Traueillers are in hatred amonge good men, reguarded none otherwise but as Rogues and Vacaboundes that can ta∣rie in no place, although indéede they haue verie iust cause to goe abroad. And therfore they call them wandring Pla∣nets and Vacaboundes, as if they were forced thereto for some punishment, or were in such wise by God punished. And y<SUP>t</SUP> by y<SUP>e</SUP> example of <HI>Cain</HI> whō God cursed, saying that he should be a Vaca∣bounde vpon the earth: béeinge also an accustomable maner of cursing among the ancient people in foretime, as <HI>Odei∣pus</HI> did among the Tragidies writers. Whervpon hath growne the Prouerbe <HI>Oedipus curse,</HI> &amp; <HI>Laertius</HI> writeth that <HI>Diogenis</HI> the Ethnick was wont to say that he had met w<SUP>t</SUP> some tragicall curse. For hee (saide he) was without house, without Citie, depriued of his cuntrey, hauinge no certentie of his lyfe.</P>
<PB N="90" REF="54"/>
<P> Thirdly, they crie out against trauei∣lers as iniurious to their Parentes, friendes, wyues, and children, whylst they seperate thēselues after a maner, voluntarely from them. Like as <HI>Pro∣pertius</HI> inueieth against one <HI>Posthu∣mus,</HI> that through an vnsatiable desire of warfare: suffred himselfe to be caried away from the most pleasaunt compa∣nie of his wife, whose curse is this.</P>
<L>If I may wishe: would God yee gree∣die wretches all were dead,</L>
<L>Or who so else loues warres aboue his faithfull spouses bed.</L>
<P>And no lesse they wish vnto him com∣mōly, who hath more delight to wāder abrood, and neuer bide in one place, thē tariyng in their owne natiue cuntrey, enioy the most acceptable companie &amp; conuersatiō of their friends &amp; kinsfolks, whervpō it was written by the Poet.</P>
<L>Him I accuse, and much accompt vnwise,</L>
<L>Abandoning his natiue Cuntrey soile:</L>
<L>Who so the same so lightly doth dispise,</L>
<L>And loues abrod in foreine land to toile.</L>
<P>Fourthly, they complaine that Tra∣ueilers must indure infinite labours
<PB N="91" REF="54"/> and troubles, &amp; not only stand in daun∣ger of their goods: but often of their life also. Which thing surely cānot be deni∣ed, as it is prooued by the examples of <HI>Vlisses,</HI> and <HI>Aeneas.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, this saying is vsually obiec∣ted against them, that is to say: <HI>They which run ouersea, chaunge the aire &amp; not their minde,</HI> and reprochfully they allege those verses which are written against such, who, traueiling abroad to studie: returne home againe neuer a whit better learned then when they went foorth.</P>
<L>Whoso to Paris to his booke doth send a foolish Asse:</L>
<L>Shall there be made no horse, but bide as erst before he was.</L>
<P>By these &amp; such like prouerbes, &amp; say∣ings, they séeme to auouch thrée things. First y<SUP>t</SUP> the exchaunge of place doth not change the persons nature. Secondly, y<SUP>t</SUP> vertues &amp; vices, are borne w<SUP>t</SUP> vs, and not first grow in vs. Thirdly, that ver∣tues cannot bée learned, nor vices for∣gottē. Al which allegaciōs of theirs are false, as hereafter we meane to declare.</P>
<PB N="92" REF="55"/>
<P> Sixtly, the cite <HI>Lycurgus</HI> lawe out of <HI>Plato,</HI> wherein hée forbad his Citizens the <HI>Lacedaemonians</HI> to traueill, alledg∣inge for a cause, that then they shall not bring straunge orders and fashions into the Commonwealth, which is a reason verie plausible, and alledged also by <HI>Plato.</HI></P>
<P>Seuenthly, they bring foorth <HI>Claudia∣nus</HI> verses against them.</P>
<L>O happie hee that spent his daies in natiue Soyles delight,</L>
<L>Whom one self house hath seene a child, and eke an aged wight.</L>
<L>Who limping with his staffe wher once he playd the litle Mouse:</L>
<L>Can count the manie yeeres which hee hath past in one poore house.</L>
<P>And also the verses of <HI>Horace</HI> writen in the ij <HI>Ode,</HI> with <HI>Ouid</HI> likewise wher he sayth.</P>
<L>Who least hath liu'd in light: beleeue mee best his dayes hath spent,</L>
<L>And eche man ought to liue within his boundes, and be content.</L>
<P>Al which testimonies i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inctly confirm,
<PB N="93" REF="55"/> that the happie lyfe consisteth in Idle∣nesse. But Traueilers may not liue idly if they be carefull of their affaires, and meane to looke well to their busi∣nesse: wherby they cannot bée thought to leade the happy lyfe, since they mete with so many mischeifes, and dangers, with sundrye casualities of Fortune that béefall in traueillinge. Let vs ther∣fore examine these argumentes, and answer to these obiections, being mind∣full of y<SUP>e</SUP> same definition which we haue set downe at the béeginning, and of such matter as we haue declared in the for∣mer chapter touching y<SUP>e</SUP> declaraciō of it.</P>
<P>And as touchinge the first two argu∣ments. For that which they call <HI>De∣portation</HI> or exile is one thing, and tra∣ueill an other, and that by consent of all Gramarianes. And although the antique Writers haue frequented one of these wordes for an other: notwith∣standing ech of them haue begon now to haue their proper and distinct sig∣nification which the custume of such as speake properly hath obtayned. And
<PB N="94" REF="56"/> therefore, although <HI>Cicero</HI> do compare exile w<SUP>c</SUP> traueill: yet is exile one thing, and traueill another. Againe, it is one thing perpetually to traueill, of which kind of trauel <HI>Cicero</HI> speketh in y<SUP>e</SUP> place alledged: another thing to traueill for a time, wherof we intreate in this place: and therfore it is no merueill if <HI>Cicero</HI> terme the first, filthie, and much emba∣seth it. For he that traueyleth perpetu∣ally, and neuer returneth into his cun∣trey from which hée hath been long ab∣sent, or séeketh not some other place where to abide there to enioy the com∣modities which he hath gathered by his long traueill: nothing differeth from a banished mā. And in y<SUP>t</SUP> he sheweth him∣self iniurious to his Cuntrey and kins∣folkes, whō he might helpe w<SUP>t</SUP> his coun∣sell and aduise, or otherwise: he is wor∣thely accoumpted an infamous person. So <HI>Vlpian</HI> likewise speaketh of perpe∣tuall traueil, which is resēbled to death. For hée that is punished with <HI>Depor∣tation,</HI> looseth the benefite of the Citie, and his fréedome, as is accoumpted a
<PB N="95" REF="56"/> dead person. And truly the word Tra∣ueiler or Straunger, signified by the Latine <HI>Peregrinus</HI> in many places in the law is taken in the better part, and vsed in the proper signification, as I haue béefore declared where I spake of traueillers Priuiledges, highly com∣mending y<SUP>t</SUP> traueiling of <HI>Cicero, Plato,</HI> and <HI>Pythagoras.</HI></P>
<P>And by this distinction also wée may shape an answer to y<SUP>e</SUP> third argument. For like as we speake not of perpetual traueiling: so doe we not excuse them that traueill for intent to bée frée from such burdens &amp; charges, as they shoulde beare at home: or y<SUP>t</SUP> they might loose the reines vnto al licentiousnes which they might not be suffred to doe at home: or else by right or wrong by false merchā∣dize, or other sinister meanes: purloyne mony frō the strange nations, béeyng ignorant of their deceitful dealing. And like as the lawes haue prouided y<SUP>•</SUP> there shall none such bée suffred in any place, yea, if there bée any that selleth vnlaw∣full Wares for lawfull is not put
<PB N="69" REF="57"/> to his fine nor amersed, but ether is ba∣nished or put to death: so they that doo altogether mislyke of traueill agrée with vs in this poynct: that wée wish such dissemblers and vacabundes shuld not only not be suffred in eny place, but also vtterly bée rooted out, and expelled from euery place.</P>
<P>Vnto the third argument it may bée answered out of the second, and third chapters. For there wée haue put a dis∣tinction béetwéene those that are méete to traueill, &amp; those y<SUP>t</SUP> ar not méete. Like∣wise béetwéene them that traueill with frute and such as take that labour vpon them for pleasure only, if so it bée, that labour may bee called a pleasure. But perhaps some man wil demaund, whe∣ther such as be maried bée méete to tra∣ueill? For ouer that, that wéemen are forbidden, as it were of honestie and womanhoode, not to take long or often iourneis in hand: it is the lawe of ma∣trimonie that those whiche bee coupled therin shall dwell euermore together, and the one to bée a comforte vnto the
<PB N="97" REF="57"/> other. Howbéeit this matter, as ap∣perteyning to y<SUP>e</SUP> wéemē, dependeth vpō the custome of the Cuntrey, as I haue touched before, in respect whereof Ma∣trimonie is not hindred. Yea, what if a man take such a viage in hand whiche would be profitable to thē both, y<SUP>•</SUP> wife and all the houshold affaires, such as are the iourneis of Merchants, &amp; other that traueil for vertue sake? Moreouer, ther may be mutuall frindship and affection shewed euē in traueiling, &amp; one minde, and one soule remaine in two bodies, although the two bodies be distant far a sunder. And the Ciuile lawes also per∣mitte men to traueill after they haue contracted mariage, if they haue a law∣full cause: wherefore it suffreth them lykewise that are maryed, since agrée∣ing together, not lying together, ma∣keth the Maryage. And so farre of are traueylers from hurting their parents, and friendes: that if they had stayde at home oftentimes they helpe them but little, but hauing traueyled, doe aduan∣tage them very much.</P>
<PB N="98" REF="58"/>
<P> Fourthly, that which they alledge cannot bée denied, as I haue shewed. But there hence it followeth not that traueill is to be neglected, since there be other meanes also wherby a man may come to casualtie and losse of goods, or bée in daunger of his lyfe. And payne which is annexed vnto traueill, is lyke∣wise common vnto all other affayres that are of any accoumpt, and whereof wée séeke praise and renoume, that I may speake nothing of the commoditie that ensueth theron.</P>
<P>To thinke on this may pleasure bée perhaps another day. As <HI>Aeneas</HI> sayde in <HI>Virgill:</HI> and manie moe such morall sentences <HI>Vlisses</HI> reciteth in <HI>Homere,</HI> for that y<SUP>e</SUP> remembrance of paines past, is woont to be pleasant vnto vs. Wher∣fore, how much the more praise, cōmo∣ditie, or honour groweth to a mā by his traueill: so much y<SUP>•</SUP> more is y<SUP>e</SUP> same plea∣sant and acceptable, and y<SUP>t</SUP> which is at∣tained without sweate, labour, or daun∣ger, is not so much estéemed of vs, as y<SUP>•</SUP> which wée obtaine with great labour,
<PB N="99" REF="58"/> and daunger, wherevppon sprange the prouerb among the Gréekes: <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: that is to say: Euery notable thing, is hard and pain∣full to be attained.</P>
<P>The fifth argument is plausible, bea∣ring experience w<SUP>t</SUP> it for witnesse. For we sée manie returne home, no lesse gi∣uen to vice then they were before they traueiled, in so muche as it is growen into a prouerbe among Dutch folk, <HI>No mā was euer the better after a long sick∣nes, or a long traueill.</HI> And although it fall out so: yet is not traueill in y<SUP>e</SUP> fault, but the men themselues. For béesides that mans nature is corrupt through y<SUP>t</SUP> offence of our first grādfather <HI>Adam,</HI> &amp; some ar so prone vnto al kind of vice, as though thei were borne to exercise thē: notwithstanding euil bringing vp, and conuersacion w<SUP>t</SUP> euil men, augmenteth this naughty dispositiō in them, &amp; of mē maketh thē beasts. Hereunto also come the snares and temptacions of the Di∣uel, enemy vnto al vertue, euil nurture of the minde, &amp; negligence of deuocion &amp;
<PB N="100" REF="59"/> godlynesse, which ought aboue althing to bée frequented. Wherefore, it is no merueill at all, if such men continue al∣waies like themselues, nothing amen∣ding their manners: for they neuer set∣led thēselues therto. But if they would diligently obserue those thinges which we haue noted before in y<SUP>e</SUP> third Chap∣ter they shuld become the better, &amp; haue a more ernest care to furnish, and decke their minde. This discommoditie also ensueth, y<SUP>t</SUP> returning frō strang lands: they ioyne thēselues to the same or like companions as they were delighted w<SUP>t</SUP> all before, or else forgetting al daūgers, giue thēselues ouer vnto all leudnesse, and sensualitie. For so then:</P>
<L>Kinde once corrupt, to wonted maners vile doth run and raunge,</L>
<L>Though much misliked, and deepely fixt in fleshe: will neuer chaunge.</L>
<P>As saith y<SUP>e</SUP> Satyrical Poet. Otherwise their saying is false, y<SUP>e</SUP> affirme how the chāging of y<SUP>e</SUP> place, changeth not a mās nature. Since experience vppon which they reason, teacheth the contrarie, and
<PB N="101" REF="59"/> therfore many are sēt into forrein cun∣trys, y<SUP>t</SUP> by their conuersation &amp; training there, they myght confirme their man∣ners neglecting vices: and learne to ap∣ply themselues to other mens maners, which no man will deny but that they may do. For if fields by diligēt husban∣ding maye bee amended: what impedi∣mēt is there, but a rude person &amp; prone to vice may bee made better by dayly cōuersation w<SUP>t</SUP> good men? For: <HI>Wrath may be aswaged by persuasiō,</HI> saith <HI>Plu∣tarch:</HI> so great is the force of company, and dayly conuersation. And like as hearbes &amp; fruites planted in one groūd, if they be remooued into another or that is of some other qualitie, they grow out of kind, in so much that they léese either their colour, or taste, and naturall qua∣litie, by reason of the nature of the soile, influence of the heauens, and goodnesse of the aire, and y<SUP>t</SUP> diuerse maner of nou∣rishment: so hapneth also y<SUP>t</SUP> like in men according to y<SUP>t</SUP> conditiō of nourishment, and the aire that compasseth them chan∣ging them into another constitutiō and
<PB N="102" REF="60"/> temperature of body, &amp; enclining them to ensue other maners, and studies. By this means a Dane is transformed into a Spaniard a Germane into a french∣man or <HI>Italian,</HI> namely by dayly con∣uersation, vse of life, &amp; custome. Wher∣fore, we must diligently take héede that we imitate the vertues and not y<SUP>e</SUP> vices of other, of which point I haue admoni∣shed before. For this which thei affirm, that vertues cannot bée learned nor vi∣ces forgotten: is false, for there is lefte vnto man a free will in suche externall matters, and there are séene euerie day examples of vertues and vices, which a man, if hée liste, may no lesse imitate then he maye the woorke of some cun∣ning woorkman, so y<SUP>t</SUP> he haue some na∣tural inclination to that art and knowe the principles of it, as of Painting, or grauing. Nether is that absolutely true which they thinke to bée, that vertues and vices are borne wyth vs, not grow in vs: but of vertues, some be na∣turall, some moral. And these last may be learned, which the lawes do declare,
<PB N="103" REF="60"/> which punish not offenders for faultes that are already doone and past, being a thing impossible y<SUP>•</SUP> that which is doone, shoulde bée vndoone againe: but they haue respecte to the time to come, and that he that hath once offended, offende no more, nor giue others occasion to of∣fend by his exāple. And truly men wer very vnfortunate and in euil case, if ha∣uing found a meanes whereby to tame wild beasts, &amp; so to instruct the sauadge disposition of Beares, Lions, Wolfes, and to teache the little birdes to flie at their pleasure, to returne home from the woods, and from their natural liber∣tie to come into theyr prison and bon∣dage, to hoppe into the cage, of theyr owne accorde: they coulde not lyke∣wyse deuyse some art whereby to bet∣ter themselues, and through labor and diligence to furnishe, and adorne their owne mindes.</P>
<P>Concerning that which they alledge out of <HI>Plato,</HI> of <HI>Lycurgus</HI> lawes: it maye bée aunswered by a rule of the lawiers, which saith, that the abuse of
<PB N="104" REF="61"/> a thing ought not to take away y<SUP>e</SUP> vse of the same. And <HI>Plato</HI> teacheth in that place, that diligent héede must be taken in a common wealth, that there bée no euill tatches nor vices brought into it, he disputeth not whether a man ought to traueill or not. For what if a man profite the common wealth by hys tra∣ueyling as <HI>Timaeus</HI> dyd in <HI>Plato,</HI> and <HI>Plato</HI> hymselfe with other innumera∣ble of whom I haue made mention be∣fore? Moreouer, who so peruseth the hi∣stories of <HI>Thucydides and xenophon,</HI> shall perceaue that the Lacedemoni∣ans were verie ciuile men of béehaui∣our, better liking of simple then subtile vertue, for the more parte borowing all their lawes of the <HI>Cretens</HI> by mea∣nes of <HI>Lycurgus.</HI> The <HI>Athenians,</HI> were very famous for varietie of doc∣trine and learning, by meanes wherof were verie more diligent in searche of such thinges as were apperteining to the weale publiques commoditie, and not leauing them vpon any abuse. And moste sure it is, that aswell the <HI>Lace∣demonians</HI>
<PB N="105" REF="61"/> as <HI>Athenians,</HI> borrowed their lawes of y<SUP>e</SUP> <HI>Egiptians.</HI> For <HI>Lycur∣gus</HI> had bene in <HI>Aegipt:</HI> and the <HI>Egip∣tians</HI> tooke their lawes of the <HI>Hebrues</HI> if wée credit <HI>Eusebius,</HI> and it is well knowne, that they receaued their laws from God himselfe. And God lykewise hath bin cause vnto manie that they should take far iournies in hand, which wée haue declared in the chapter goynge next béefore: and Poets feigne, that <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣neas</HI> was mooued to traueill by <HI>Mercu∣rie. Vlisses</HI> by <HI>Somnus,</HI> and other noble and valyent men by other Gods also, And <HI>Plato</HI> also doth the lyke. For in his booke <HI>De vniuersitate</HI> translated (as I suppose) by <HI>Tully,</HI> vnder the person of of the <HI>Egiptian</HI> Prieste, hee sharply re∣proouethe the <HI>Greekes</HI> for neglectinge antiquitie, and for lingringe idlely at home, and calleth them Children, cas∣tinge them in the téeth with their igno∣raunce. For to bée ignoraunt of such thinges as are done béefore our tyme, whereof there are markes and tokens to this day remayning: what is it other
<PB N="106" REF="62"/> (as the same <HI>Cicero</HI> saith) then alwaies to be a childe.</P>
<P>Last of all, the assertions whiche are alledged out of the Poetes of the happie lyfe, ought to bée no impediment or hindrance to traueillers, or what soeuer lyke thinge there is that may deterre a man from traueillynge, if hée bée other∣wise disposed thereto of himselfe. For <HI>Ouid</HI> had iuste cause to complayne of Fortune, which hée abused, so that hée was against his wyll constrayned to go into banishment among the <HI>Getes,</HI> and not to traueill. And as for <HI>Claudianus,</HI> hée spake in the person of another, as it appeareth by the tytle of that Epi∣gramme, which was an ould man and wealthy, and (as the frugalytie of the auncient time required) content with his owne estate, mistykyng superfluitie and varietie in all thinges. Moreouer both of them in those their verses, com∣mende the rurall and Cuntrey lyfe, preferringe it before all affaires &amp; dea∣lings in the citie, and cases of iudgment and businesse in manie matters. How∣beit,
<PB N="107" REF="62"/> it appeareth also by their wri∣tinges, that the same men doe not con∣demne traueill and experience gotten that way, but in sundrie places deteste sluggish idlenesse, especiallye beinge e∣uident that they themselues haue tra∣ueilled. For <HI>Horace</HI> beynge an <HI>A∣pulian</HI> by birth, studied Philosophye at <HI>Athens:</HI> and <HI>Claudianus</HI> lyued vn∣der the Emperour <HI>Theodosius,</HI> beinge borne in <HI>Alexandria</HI> a Citie in <HI>Egipt.</HI> And if wée should graunt that they had an éeuell opinion of traueillinge, which indéede is otherwise: truely they had erred in this respect, since most euident it is, y<SUP>t</SUP> ther was yet neuer any mā that atchiued any singular and notable thing vnlesse hee had traueilled, as wee haue prooued by example of sundrye in the former Chapter. For great and no∣table déedes, are not perfourmed but through wisdome and skyll of thinges and men: whiche beinge not shut vp in some one corner of the Worlde, but dispersed ouer the whole earth, it is no marueill, if to the attaynmente
<PB N="108" REF="63"/> thereof, it bée necessarye to traueill into sundrye Landes, and ouer manie parts of the Worlde.</P>
<P>The laste Argument, and quite bée∣side the matter, is alle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dged by some man of his owne experience or opinion againste Traueile.

<HEAD>¶ <HI>An Answere to the principall question, with</HI> a notable commendati∣on <HI>of Traueill therto</HI> annexed.</HEAD>
<HEAD><HI>The.</HI> 9. <HI>Chapter</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOw therfore it is no hard matter, to answer vnto the question which wée mooued at the beginninge, and to determine, whether Traueill do a man more good or éeuell. For who so dily∣gently weigheth what so euer wée haue sayde hetherto: shall perceaue that in time of peace or War, it is most profi∣table vnto all that are desirous to attain vnto vertue, or take any great matter in hand. Neither is their opinion and iudgement to bée liked of, which desire rather to liue obscurelye at home then with commendacion, as the Clowne in <HI>Claudianus</HI> and <HI>Polyphemus</HI> in <HI>Ho∣mere.</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="64"/> And what other doo the Poetes meane by the Goddesses <HI>Calipso</HI> and <HI>Circe,</HI> whom I haue me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>irned, then to reprehende the desire of filthy lustes and obscure Idlenesse, and to shew how <HI>Vlisses,</HI> and whosoeuer else is desirous of praise and glorye: is nothinge de∣lighted in idlenesse and pleasures, but by all meanes endeuoureth to attaine to vertu, although he must endure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> M. dangers. So haue <HI>Christophorus Co∣lumbarius,</HI> and <HI>Vespusius,</HI> assaid infinit perilles, who were the finders out of that part of the World whiche they call <HI>America.</HI> Howbeit they haue thereby purchased to themselues euerlastinge memorie, leauing behind them to poste∣ritie the trueth of such matter, whereof ther was neuer thought to be any such. These Philosophers, Phisicions, Law∣iers, Iuristes, Kinges, warriours, and Diuines, what praise haue thei not got∣ten by traueillyng? That whoso is not cōtented with these: let hym adde more∣ouer vnto them sundrye other excellent mē, whō <HI>Franciscus Senensis</HI> reporteth
<PB N="111" REF="64"/> to haue taken often and longe traueilles in hande, whiche they accomplished for vertue, and glory sake. There haue bene some also, whom not so much their owne as others vertue, power, &amp; wise∣dome, hath moued to traueill. Like as the holy Scripture witnesseth, y<SUP>t</SUP> the po∣wer, and wisdome of <HI>Salomon</HI> was so great: that the kinges of <HI>Tharsus,</HI> and Quéenes of <HI>Arabia,</HI> came thither to sée and heare hym, and wée reade also, how certen noble men came from y<SUP>e</SUP> further∣most partes of France and Spaine, to <HI>Titus Liuius</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> fownteine of eloquēce, not mooued so muche with the power &amp; same of the Citie of <HI>Rome:</HI> as with the report of that one man. I my selfe haue séene a Moonke in <HI>Bononie,</HI> who in tra∣ueilling ouer his owne cuntrey of <HI>Italy</HI> spent 9. whole yéeres: so surueyinge and discribing it, that no man coulde set it foorth more lyuely with pen, or ex∣presse it w<SUP>c</SUP> pensill, insomuch that there is not the least thing left out vntouched And yet he was but a Monk, whose life ought to be solitarie, &amp; as <HI>Gratian</HI> saith,
<PB N="112" REF="65"/> none vnles it bée in Cloister, as nether the Fishes out of the Water.</P>
<P>Wherefore, neither hypocrisie, nor any holynesse of lyfe, forbiddeth a man to Traueill, so that hée doe it to any ho∣nest vse, or commoditie, redoundinge to himselfe or others. Neither are they to bée lyked of, who if they would: might traueill, but had rather liue at home lea∣dinge an obscure lyfe, then to wynne praise by traueilyng. For such not on∣ly, offend against their friends, and the whole commonwealth: but also against thēselues. For it is the peculier nature of mankind to be euermore desirous of knowlege, and neuer to bée contented w<SUP>t</SUP> one thing only, whether that know∣ledge come by hearinge or séeinge, for man hath these sences whereby he at∣tayneth skill, as sayth <HI>Aristotle.</HI> But as <HI>Horace</HI> witnesseth:</P>
<L>The things we heare, les cause the minde and sences to arise:</L>
<L>Then doe the thinges in presence whiche are subiect to the eies.</L>
<P>Yea they are of greater force and effi∣cacie,
<PB N="113" REF="65"/> and are more firmely reteyned in memorie which wée se before our eies: then the report or only hearesay of any thinge, although there come of it no pro∣fite, no pleasure, nor honestye. And I haue shewed that by traueilynge there ensueth verie great commoditie in eue∣rie kind of lyfe, and as for the honestie thereof: no man can doubt, being enfor∣med by many examples. And if wée measure honestie by paines, not rashly but vpon iust cause taken in hand: then truely traueill, of whiche wée intreat in this place, shall yéeld to none. For tra∣ueillers are enforced to abyde all labors and susteine al troubles. Moreouer, like as these men whiche may and ought to traueill and yet doo not traueill, commit a shamefull deede: so they that are giuen to traueilling, perfourme a most honest exployt. For these doo rightly vse their féet, the other abuse them. For nature &amp; God the maker of all thinge, hath not giuen vs féete for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tent wee shoulde walke vp and downe in our owne Ci∣tie or Cuntrey only, but that if occasion
<PB N="114" REF="66"/> serue wée shuld also go sée and frequent forreine nacions also: for else doubtlesse God and Nature woulde haue shut vp the wayes and forbidden the passedge to straunge Cuntries. And what can be more delectable, then to béeholde the things wherof thou hast read sumthing or heard of other, and againe to béeholde in minde and contemplatiō those things which thou hast somtime séene, and to applie them to thy vse. Wherein I wyl speake nothinge of the profite or com∣moditie? For it much aueileth vnto the getting of perfect and sownd know∣ledge, or learninge of any Art, to trauell vnto such places where such Artes doe most flourish, and are faithfully taught. So y<SUP>t</SUP> they deserue none excuse, whose lyfe is only to think, as <HI>Cicero</HI> writeth of certen Philosophers, and such as get all their wisdome at home, being much affeard lest if they traueilled: the skie woulde fall on their heades, or the earth sinke vnder them: when as they might learne that which they séeke for, better and with greater profite of straungers,
<PB N="115" REF="66"/> and alliens, especiallye if they haue money to beare their charges abroade as well as at home. And it hapneth manie times, that they that kéepe themselues at home vpon this persua∣sion, that there is no lyfe pleasant out of a mans owne Cuntrey, or else do feare that by change of place they shoulde al∣so change their maners: let them then be wyfe only in theyr owne conceites, and contempne others in respecte of themselues, beynge puffed vp with an opinion of knowledge, a thinge so éeuell, that a more woorse or more daungerous in all the Worlde can bée none deuised.</P>
<L>Eche Land vnto a valient man his cuntrey is, right so</L>
<L>As is eche sea vnto the sellie fish where ere shee go.</L>
<P>A man shall euerie where finde sum∣thinge that hee may learne, and that another time may doe hym good. Su∣rely the knowledge &amp; search of forrein Realmes, hath alwaies bin accompted
<PB N="116" REF="67"/> so pleasant profitable and glorious that certen it is, that many for none other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>se then a loue and desire thereof, and that they might sée experience of things haue forsaken their natiue Cuntreys, deare Parentes, Wiues, Children, Freindes, and that more is, leauynge the reguarde of their owne health, haue sumtimes vndertakē very far <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ies with great difficultie, perill, care, and anguishe.</P>
<P>Since therefore, traueill is honeste, pleasant, profitable, and commodious: what man withée ashamed to take it in hand, that is prouided, and méet thereto and that by example of so many Empe∣rours, kings, wisemen, warriours, and other worthy personages that haue tra∣ueilled, to sée straunge and far Coun∣treys, &amp; to wander wide abroad? wher∣by are knowne the peculyar behauiors of euery cuntrey, their disposition, diet, appareill, maner of buildinge, situation of places, tillage, moreouer Lawes, all doctrines &amp; opinious, holy and profane, and finally the nature of all things.

Whiche if they bee dilligently obserued and in such or∣der as wee haue delyuered them doe shewe that what soeuer straunge or dangerous accidēts befall vs in traueil∣lynge, it chaunceth not so much by hu∣mane negligence, as it is to bee ascri∣bed vnto to the prouidence of eternall
<PB N="119" REF="68"/> God For the condicion of our lyfe is suche, that it is exposed, and lyeth open vnto infinite miseries, and there was yet neuer man blessed in all respectes, or that could escape death. Whereby all changes and chaunces of Fortune, are more indifferently to be borne, and wee must suppose that nothinge can be∣fall vnto vs, that hath not also hapned vnto others. And for as much as ex∣amples bringe lyght to preceptes, ma∣king y<SUP>e</SUP> matter more euide. it, as the La∣wier sayth: I thinke it worthe the tra∣ueill, to declare that by some example, whiche I admonished generally to bée considered in all traueill. Whiche thinge that I shoulde more wyllyngly accomplishe, partlye the remembrance of suche thinges as ether I my selfe haue séene in sundrie places, or haue heard of others, hath mooued mee part∣ly the very maiestie of Antiquitie and knowledge, whiche is woont of it selfe to delight, and is exceptable vnto all men.

Wherfore I meane to touch in this second B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke such thinges as are in the Realme of <HI>Naples</HI> worthy to bee séene, since there is scarce no other place in all Christendome, in my opinion, ly∣ing within the compasse of <HI>Europe,</HI> for holsomnesse of aire, situation, pleasant∣nesse, abundance, or ciuilitie, match vn∣to it.

<P>WHen wée were departed forthe of this hugie and waste mole and building: we came to <HI>Alle Cento ca∣merelle,</HI> lying directly oueragainst the other, beyng so called for that it contei∣neth nothing but Chambers and Cel∣les, leadyng one to another. At this present it is situate vppon a Hill, but whether it were so in olde tyme or not. I doubt, by reason of downefalles and valtes, whereof some and deuided from the residew of the buildyng, whereby it should séeme that it had bin sumtime <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yder and trimmer. When we were entred into these ruines, wée came a∣gain vnto a great building foursquare, standing vpon fouresquare pillers, and
<PB N="126" REF="72"/> beyng of a fouresquare forme: nears vnto one of which pillers there was a hole, into which our hoste that conduc∣ted vs to the sighte of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se antiquities, descended to receaue vs, and helpe vs as wée went downe. Then came wée into a great wyde place full of Celles and little rowmes, euerie one foure∣square, but some bygger then other. From thence there laye open a waye to other wyde places and Celles, for the whole buildyng was deuided by sundrye crookes and turnynges. And it was so intricate and diffuse, by rea∣son of the lykenesse of the Celles, that some not without cause iudged that it had béene sometyme a <HI>Labyrinthe,</HI> a∣monge whom is <HI>Antonius de Russis</HI> a <HI>Calabrian,</HI> whom I suppose rather to haue thoughte so in respecte of the fourme, then for anye other circum∣stances. <HI>Leander</HI> of <HI>Bononie,</HI> thyn∣keth that it was a Cesterne, or place wherein water was kepte in the olde tyme. But I coulde sée no tooken or argument whereby I mighte coniec∣ture

<L><HI>Wherby the Greekes by name Auer∣na mouth that place do call.</HI></L>
<P>Vpon the hilles lying thereby, stand certein buildinges almost of our tyme faire, and pleasant, but they are almost hoat Bathes. <HI>Plinie</HI> hath noted that y<SUP>e</SUP> towne of <HI>Cimmerij</HI> stoode néere to this Laque, whose labour was to dig Met∣tall

<P>We must goe downe to the foote of y<SUP>e</SUP> hill, whereas there is a darke entraunce into the caue, into which we went with Torchelight, following our guid.

From thēce there
<PB N="131" REF="74"/> was a way which lead into certein chā∣bers, straunge to beholde, and altoge∣ther vnlike to those hundred aboue mē∣cioned. For they be larger, and higher.

For it is certein, y<SUP>t</SUP> the ci∣tie of <HI>Naples</HI> called in old time <HI>Parthe∣nope,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The olde ame of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aples,</HI> was <HI>arthenope.</HI></NOTE> tooke beginning of that: the inha∣bitants being sent from <HI>Cuma</HI> thither.

<PB N="137" REF="77"/> to driue away that mischiefe: report go∣eth that they asked counsel of the Oria∣cle, which answered, that <HI>Naples</HI> was the cause of that plague, and that it should neuer cease vnlesse they buylded that citie agayne, and restored it to the former state. Whiche when they had done: the plague immediatly ceased, but the Citie afterwarde beinge troubled with sedition of the people, and manye Earthquakes, lost the naturall strength like an olde mother, leauing behinde her a daughter, to wit, the Citie of <HI>Naples,</HI> which indéede lyueth and flourishe that this day.</P>
<P>Now were wée come to the Hauen <HI>Baianum,</HI> which was made by <HI>Agrip∣pa,</HI> as <HI>Dion Cassius</HI> writeth, where wée forsooke our Boat, and prepared to sayle to <HI>Puteoli.</HI> And as we were say∣lyng, wée behéelde alonge in our course sundry high Hilles and Mountaynes, at the féete of whiche were continuall rankes of downe fallen Houses, wher∣by we might easly coniecture that there stoode some great Towne in ould time,
<PB N="138" REF="78"/> but that it was cast downe by Earth∣quaks that often times are séene there, and for that cause were forsaken of the inhabitants. For ther appéere y<SUP>e</SUP> expres tokens of a wasted citie or towne now all ouer growne with bushes &amp; briers, and a few houses are inhabited by pore Mariners and Fishermen, because the harbor is indifferent safe. Which whē I béeheld: it came into my minde what <HI>Seruius Sulpitius</HI> wrate vnto <HI>Cicero</HI> in a certen place, how when hée retourned vpon a time out of <HI>Asia,</HI> and was say∣lynge from <HI>Aegina</HI> towardes <HI>Megara,</HI> hée was incompassed round about (as he sayde) with carcases of townes.

Wherfore I fel into wondring at the state and fortune of all worldly thinges, and thus I thought within my self, good Lord, what shal on

At the first entrance we came into a large and high chamber, whose wals and vault of the gate were sumtime finely trimmed with checke∣red poynct deuise, which the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>tes that yet remain do sufficiently witnes. The entrance into this chamber is in∣different wide, and within by the side of ech wall stand bedstedes made of stone
<PB N="141" REF="79"/> walled about, whereon are Beddes and Pyllowes caste, where they that haue washed themselues may lye downe and take their rest. Moreouer, at the fyrste comming in, stande two Lauers foure∣square, two foote déepe, directlye ouer a∣gainst the Baynes, which ar very tem∣perate, retayning no strong smell at all, neither of Brimstone or any thing else, but consisting only of <HI>Niter</HI> and <HI>Alume.</HI> But the hole where out the water issu∣eth is wide and large, and so hansomely hollowed: that many may wash them∣selues in it together, but the farther that a man goeth into it, the hotter is the water. They say that these Baynes are verie healthsome, béesids y<SUP>t</SUP> they be also passing pleasant, by reason of the Sea which is nigh at hand, whose waues in tossinge and woorkynge, doo engender a delectable noyse and murmuringe. Without the Caue there standeth Lad∣der conteininge about twenty stales, by whiche wée ascend s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>opewise into Heat∣house, commonly tearmed a sweatynge House.

<P>MOreouer, betwéene this place and y<SUP>e</SUP> citi <HI>Puteoli</HI> (now called <HI>Pozolo)</HI> we saw two other things worth the no∣ting. The one is a fowntaine or well in y<SUP>t</SUP> sea, y<SUP>e</SUP> other, y<SUP>e</SUP> way which they cōmon∣ly cal <HI>Attellana.</HI> Ther ariseth out of the
<PB N="144" REF="81"/> Sea a passing running cléere, and swéet Fowntayne of fresh water, pleasant in taste two foote déepe, as big as a mans head. I suppose the causes thereof are certen secret passages vnder the ground, which conueie the water thyther from the shoare adioining, where it breaketh foorth. Of the same opinion is <HI>Lean∣der Bononiensis</HI> a Moonke very well learned, who hath described <HI>Italy,</HI> no man more dilligently in my iudgment. Howbeit it mai be, that when this place was the maine land: the Inhabitantes had conueied the fresh water by conduit pipes through the ruines and Ashes of the citie <HI>Puteoli,</HI> which thei vsed in stéed of a Well or Fowntayne, and that af∣terward the sea brake in and ouerflow∣ed all that land, wheras y<SUP>t</SUP> spring yet re∣mayneth. It yéeldeth foorth water so a∣bundantly, that a man may discerne the streame thereof agreat way runninge along, from the sea water, being cleerer &amp; more lyke to wel water. But I remē∣ber that I haue séene the lyke of this béefore at <HI>Dordracū</HI> a Towne in <HI>Hol∣land,</HI>
<PB N="145" REF="81" MS="y"/> where the riuer <HI>Mosa</HI> called the Maze (vnlesse I bee deceaued) floweth with no lesse force into the <HI>Germane</HI> O∣ceane in a streame almoste thrée Pear∣ches or Poles broade. <HI>Plinie</HI> hath noted that in the shoare <HI>Baian,</HI> in some places there riseth hoat runninge water out of the Sea, whereof I am able to saye nothing.</P>
<P>And as touchinge the way called <HI>At∣tellana,</HI> you must vnderstande, that the same on both sides lyeth thick of Cotta∣ges and small houses fallen downe, the fourme of which are some rounde, some fouresquare: and in these litle tabernes, are certen vautes and arches, in whiche are séene Coffins and Pottes with the bones and ashes of dead men in them, whereby wée coniectured that the same was apointed in ould time for a place of buriall. Howbeit, they whiche dwell neare vnto it, say that it was builded for a place to kéepe wares in to bée soulde, and vpon that perswasion they call it in the vulgare toongue, <HI>Il mercato di Sa∣bato.</HI> Sure it is, that in the ould time
<PB N="146" REF="82"/> the bodies of dead men were w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nte to be brent, and the ashes layd vp in p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts. This is moreouer to bee wondered at that one of our companions tooke out of one of y<SUP>e</SUP> pots a péece of y<SUP>e</SUP> skull of a mans heade of a wonderful thicknes. For this is an argument, y<SUP>•</SUP> not only the ashes of dead men were inclosed in these pottes: but also the bones after that the fleshe was consumed away in the Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fines.

But let vs now leane the dead, and not fight with bones.</P>
<P>Beefore wée came to <HI>Puteoli,</HI> wee chaunced to light vpon them that make Alume. These he winge litle stones out of the hilles harde by, burne them in a Kill, then layinge them on heapes the space of certen dayes: cast water vpon them whith they draw out of Pittes, that they may sake in it after the mai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er of lime, and fall the more easely into ponder. Then make they lye of these

M. D. xxxviij. there suddeinly arose an hill out of the grounde, which remaineth vnto thys day, conteining in compasse about foure myles. Béefore this Hill arose, there were continually Earthquakes in that place the space of certein dayes without intermission, and fiers of Brimstonie substaunce, and of that liquour whych commonlye is called <HI>Oleum Petrae,</HI>
<PB N="158" REF="88"/> Oyle of the Rocke. But anone, when thys fier béegan to growe to a great flame, and when the matter of the fyer was some deale spent, there insued suche tumbling out of stones, and such flying vp of Ashes, fierce windes, and horrible perturbacion of the ayre: that it was feared that all the whole frame of the worlde would fall. All whyche accidentes <HI>Leander Bononiensis</HI> hath diligently noted, and béefore him a cer∣teyne <HI>Salernitane</HI> wryting in the <HI>Ita∣lian</HI> tongue, one that béehelde that wo∣full and terrible Tragedie. <HI>Simon Portius</HI> lykewyse wroate of the same matter, in a Booke intituled, <HI>Of the burnyng of the Realme of Naples.</HI> And although thys wonderfull and strange spectacle, was the handye woorke of God, who ruleth the inferiour course of Nature: yet are the causes there∣of to bée weyghed, if there bée any to bée founde to depende vppon naturall reason.

<P>THe chiefest Merket place of the Ci∣tie is foursquare, and verye broade, and large, but not paued, in the midste wherof stande a paire of Gallowes, and a scaffold set vp for the nonce to put tres∣passers to death vpon: also a Chappell, rightouer againste whiche, is a Well with a very large Cesterne or Lauer. In the Merket place are many Innes, but they bée of the meane and common sorte, and the greatest want in <HI>Naples,</HI> is of clenly and soote lodgings, although that be an infinite number of Tauerns and vittling houses in it.</P>
<P>It hath not manie Churches, but those whiche it hath are verye faier, a∣mongst which the Cathedrall Churche of Sainct <HI>Clare</HI> is passing bewtyfull, and so is y<SUP>t</SUP> also which is dedicated vnto
<PB N="174" REF="96"/> Sainct <HI>Luio,</HI> sauing that it is ouer dark. Sainct <HI>Maries</HI> of the Preachinge Fri∣ers, is a verie proper Churche, for it standeth vpon one of the moste pleasant and loftyest places of the Citie, and within, it is almoste made al of Marble without any periettinge or plastering: but it is sumwhat of the narowest. Sainct <HI>Marie</HI> Churche <HI>Di Carbona,</HI> is very mutch frequented for deuocion sake, whiche is a House of Religion not farre from the Merket place, by reason whereof it hath in it a number of vo∣wed Tables, and two Chappels all of Marble faste béeside the higher Altare. Within the Altare is a Tumbe, wher∣in reste the bodies of <HI>Robert</HI> Kinge of <HI>Naples</HI> and his Wyfe, verye sump∣tuous: insomutch that the report goeth, that there is neuer a péece of woorke to be found in all <HI>Europe,</HI> of greater ma∣iestie then that is. Howbeit, if not fai∣erer then this, yet in my opinion, match vnto it is that, wherein lyeth the bodie of <HI>William Croius</HI> and his Wife
<PB N="175" REF="96"/> in <HI>Belgicum</HI> or Dutchlande, not farre from <HI>Louane;</HI> at the Castle of <HI>Heffria.</HI> Likewise the Tumbe of <HI>Mauritius</HI> of <HI>Saxonie</HI> one of the Dukes Electours, at <HI>Friburge</HI> in <HI>Hermonduris,</HI> and that also wherein his Wyfe lieth at <HI>Vima∣ria,</HI> in <HI>Thuringe,</HI> and moreouer the same which is builded at <HI>Heidelburge,</HI> in the memorie of Duke <HI>Palatine,</HI> Duke Electour.

But amongst al that are séene in any of these aboue named Regions, made of Brasse or Copper, in my iudgement, the Tumbe of Kinge <HI>Henrie</HI> the seuenth King of <HI>Englande,</HI> surpasseth the residew, whiche standeth in the Abbey of Westminster nigh to the Citie of London, with an inscripti∣on in Latine verses, which may thus bée Englished.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> 18. <HI>Chapter.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MOreouer, there are at <HI>Naples</HI> foure Storehouses, and as the Grecians term them <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, euery one foursquare benched rounde aboute mutch lyke the place at <HI>Andwarp</HI> whiche they call the Burse, or at London the Roiall Ex∣change, and at <HI>Venice la piazza del ri∣uo alto.</HI> In these Store houses at certen times of the yéere are generall assem∣blies, and counselles holden. And Mer∣chauntes also méete dayly in them, to bargein and deale in Merchandize.</P>
<P>There are thrée Castles, whereof twayne stande faste by the Sea side, to wit: the new and the ould, the thirde is situate vppon the high Hill that lyeth ouer the Towne. And it is so stronge,
<PB N="178" REF="98"/> and so well fortified: that hée that hast possession of that Castle may easely ma∣ster the Citi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, yea although it were sur∣prised by the enemie. A litle beneth this castle is a house of <HI>Carthusians,</HI> wherof the Church is dedicated to Sainct <HI>Mar∣tine,</HI> from whence there is a merueil∣lous pleasaunt prospect, both ouer the Citie, and the sea. But in the ould Cas∣tle which standeth by the way <HI>Capuana</HI> are very auntient buildinges and Ima∣gerie to bée séene, and there is also an Armarie wherein is kept the complete armour of <HI>Fraunces</HI> Kinge of France, whiche hée woare vpon hym when hee was taken prisoner at the Citie <HI>Tici∣num</HI> now termed <HI>Pauia</HI> in <HI>Lumbardie</HI> very faire, made of pure stéel, and with∣out any furniture of Golde. Foorth of the Castle you may goe into excéedinge large, and goodly Gardeines: and within the Castle is an hangynge Gardeine, but the same, besids a pleasant prospect, hath nothinge else in it.</P>
<P>The newe Castle is builded at the entrance into y<SUP>e</SUP> citie of <HI>Tiburtine</HI> stone
<PB N="179" REF="98"/> fouresquare. In the same place in ould time stoode a Religious House of prea∣ching Friers, whiche is now conuerted to another vse. It is fortified on that side whiche lyeth to the Citie with a verie déepe ditch, lyke as it were double tren∣ched. For when you be past the firste Ditch: anone you shall sée the Castle, which lykewise is fenced with a trench, Walles, and Turretes, and it standeth vpon a stéepe downefall of an hyll. It hath a verie faire gate in the innersyde made all of Marble, openinge vpon a large Courte fouresquare, sumewhat long. At the left hande when you enter in, there is is a litle Hal likewise foure∣square, wherein the méetinges and as∣semblies of the Estates of the whole Realme, are kept euery yéere: &amp; the <HI>Vi∣cere</HI> of the cuntrey vseth to kéepe court, and sit in iudgment there euery wéeke.

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> 19. <HI>Chapter.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is wounderfull to sée, what plentie of most auntient Images are to bee séene in the Citie of <HI>Naples,</HI> yea in pri∣uate mens houses, namely of <HI>Bacchus, Mercurie, Hercules, Brutus,</HI> and the whole patterne of the auntient maner of warfare. There bée also Statues made wearinge on them gownes, and a mightye horsehead made of Bras very cunningly wrought, the lyke wherof is séene at <HI>Rome</HI> in the pallace of the Car∣dinall <HI>De valle.</HI> Howbeit one <HI>Cyriacus Anconitanus,</HI> hath writen verye dilly∣gentlye of all these matters, for that which <HI>Apianus</HI> and <HI>Amantius</HI> haue set
<PB N="182" REF="100"/> foorth in this argument touchinge an∣tiquities: is for the more part taken out of him.</P>
<P><HI>Fredirick</HI> the seconde Emperoure of <HI>Rome,</HI> founded the Vniuersitie in this Citie, whiche flourisheth at this daye. While I abode there, <HI>Simon Portus,</HI> a famous Philosopher and Physition, departed this lyfe. The same, béesides the Booke whiche hée wroat of the bur∣ninge of the cuntrie of, <HI>Puteolis,</HI> wher∣of I made mencion béefore, wroat a Booke of the Soule, of the Senses, of Coulers, of the <HI>Germain</HI> Mayden, and many other moe. One <HI>Mercellus</HI> of <HI>Siene</HI> was of great renowme amonge the <HI>Icti,</HI> a man very well learned and eloquent: as for Diuinitie that was in those daies sent to the Monasteries and Abbeies, as it was likewise in the more part of all <HI>Italie. Naples</HI> féeleth winter scarselye the space of two Monthes, to wit, <HI>Ianuarie</HI> &amp; <HI>Februarie.</HI> They haue raine often, but without snowe, and in Summer season extreame heat, by rea∣son whereof they seldome haue anye
<PB N="183" REF="100"/> stéepe couerings and rouffes vpon their Housen as are in other Cuntries, that in the night time they may walke vpon the top of the Houses in the Leades, to coole their bodies. In the vulgare toonge this Citie is termed by the name of <HI>Gentiles,</HI> which is to say Noble, lyke as <HI>Rome</HI> is called Great, <HI>Venice</HI> Ritch, <HI>Florence</HI> Faire, as I coniecture to the imitation of the Gréekes, whiche vsed also to commende their chiefe Cities by some notable Title. For <HI>Athenaeus</HI> comparinge certen Cities together: cal∣leth it Golden <HI>Alexandria,</HI> Bewtifull <HI>Antiochia,</HI> very bewtifull <HI>Nicomedia,</HI> and the Citie of <HI>Athens</HI> most glorious, the mightie Citie, and Breuiarie, as it were, of al the whole Worlde. And I think, that <HI>Naples</HI> was called Noble by reason of the great number of Noble men that dwell in it, &amp; the e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cesse which is vsed there. And a man shall not finde in any other place of all <HI>Italie,</HI> so great plenty of most excellent and couragious Horses, as hée shall there: But if a man would bringe a Horse of that Cuntrey
<PB N="184" REF="101"/> out of the Realme: hée must pay some custome or tolledge for hym, and they sell there not only Horses, and all other kindes of Merchandize: but also slaues, as wel men as women. There are ma∣ny Théeues, and in sundrye places the Neapolitanes are euill spoken of, not so mutch for that themselues be of an euill Nature: but bicause they harbour ma∣ne naughty persons, and haue naughtie neighbours. Those are the <HI>Apuli∣ans,</HI> and <HI>Calabrians,</HI> and <HI>Sicilians,</HI> of whom, that is to saye, the laste, that may truely bée sayde whiche <HI>Cicero</HI> wroat of them: <HI>All Iland dwellers are naught, but the Sicilians are woorst of all.</HI></P>
<P>But now, as concerninge the proper∣ties of the the People of <HI>Naples:</HI> they are not so mutche delighted with the Gréeke: and Latine: as with the <HI>He∣truscan</HI> tongue, and they mocke the <HI>Ca∣labrians</HI> with their language, and lyke∣wise the <HI>Calabrians</HI> scorne at the <HI>Apu∣lians.</HI> Their talke is full of brag∣ginge and boastinge, insomutche that
<PB N="185" REF="101"/> they despise the counsell of othermen, and prefer their owne wittes before al others. It sufficeth their merchantes if you giue them your woorde, but if you breake promise, they be very sharp re∣uengers of the iniurie done vnto them, like as they be very mindfull of a good turne receaued. They fare passing sūp∣tuously, and sometime they spend more Sugar at a meale then they do breade, imitating therein the <HI>Sicilians.</HI> In ap∣pairell they bée proude, and therin they bestow ouer much cost both in tyme of Warre, and Peace. They assault their enemy with notable courage and opor∣tunitie, &amp; they haue horses verie méete for the warres, wheron they be erpert in riding, and guide thē with meruey∣lous dexteritie of body. They are too too much giuen to loue and ouer amarous, but especially of suche wéemen as are painted in face, and proud of hart, vnto which two thinges their wéemen doe principally apply themselues. Other∣wise they bee very good huswyues, and bée most precise, and as it were, religi∣ous
<PB N="186" REF="102"/> in honouring their louers. To con∣clude, the people of <HI>Naples</HI> are verye curteous and friendly to straungers, and loue them in whom they sée anye notable or singular qualitie, but if they sée no such thing: they litle estéeme thē.

<HEAD><HI>The.</HI> 20. <HI>Chapter.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WIthout the Citie, on y<SUP>e</SUP> side which is contrarie or oueragainst y<SUP>t</SUP> hill <HI>Pausilipus:</HI> are séene the kinges Pittes or Pondes commonly called <HI>Pozzi reali,</HI> truely verie fayre, and worthie to bée throughly viewed. And vnlesse I bée deceaued, there is the lyke place at <HI>Rome,</HI> and at <HI>Ferraria Ilbel Veder,</HI> which is to saye, as I interprete it, A
<PB N="187" REF="102"/> place for Summer consisting of hou∣ses, Gardeines, and Riuers: likewyse most excellent for prospecte, and plea∣sant situation. This goodly building or rather Pallaice, was erected by <HI>Ferdi∣nand</HI> of <HI>Arragō</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> first, king of <HI>Naples</HI> in fourme fouresquare, but somewhat long, in whose walles stand very aun∣cient Pictures to be séene. The middle court was made to washe in, wythout couert in the open aire, from whence we mount vp thrée steppes into a place lyke a Lauer or Cesterne, into which you may let in the water at your plea∣sure, and that great Courte is round a∣boute compassed with a beautifull, and verie gorgeous gallerie. But in y<SUP>e</SUP> last siege of the Citie of <HI>Naples,</HI> y<SUP>t</SUP> French∣men spoyled not onely this Gallerie: but welnighe all the whole Pallaice. While this washing place was whole, I suppose there was none more mag∣nificall or pleasaunter in al <HI>Italy.</HI> Ouer against this Pallaice, standeth another Princely buildynge, or Pallaice, and a place also from whence Water is
<PB N="188" REF="103"/> conueid in pypes vnto the citie. From thēce wée passe into Gardeins in which there is another gallerie, before whom lieth a large and wide plot, but waste and forlorne, alouergrowne w<SUP>c</SUP> réedes, bushes, and briars. From hence againe wée goe into other gardeines: at length wée come vnto a fountaine or conduite head passing faire and cleare, and full of holsome swéete water. Hard by this conduite head stoode certen Cagies and Couppes, wherein were kepte sundry kindes of beasts, and liuing things, but they were also broken by the French∣men. Thē from this place we may re∣turne again to the first, through offices and places apperteining to y<SUP>e</SUP> houshold, where are many spoutes and Welles, and many pleasant murmurings cau∣sed by falling and flowing of the water, likewise groues, and the pleasant fight of varitie of fruites.</P>
<P>From this place wée maye goo too sée the remainder and monumentes of the citie <HI>Palaeopolis,</HI> whereof <HI>Liuius</HI> ma∣keth mencion. There is also another
<PB N="189" REF="103"/> place not far from <HI>Naples</HI> of nolesse de∣light then anye of the aboue recited, at the fourthe stone from the Citie, at the foote of the hill <HI>Vesuuius</HI> or <HI>Summi,</HI> in which hill <HI>Plinius</HI> the writer of the na∣turall historie, and Lieutenant ouer the fléete to <HI>Augustus:</HI> perished among the ashes, which <HI>Plinius</HI> the second testifi∣eth in an Epistle, and the same hil not long before had burned lyke the hill of <HI>Aetna</HI> in <HI>Sicil.</HI> At the foote of this Hill ther groweth Greekish wine or Sack, which some call <HI>Vinum Pompeianum</HI> or <HI>Pompeius</HI> wine, which is very good and perfecte, and much commended of by the writings of sundry men. The Pallace whiche standeth there taketh name of the village which is néere vn∣to it, and is called <HI>Pietra biancha,</HI> wee may call it in Englishe <HI>White stone, or whiterocke,</HI> builded all within of white Marble, and bewtified in the lodgings with checkred work of point deuise. In this Pallace is made the Image of a Nymphe sléeping, and leaning vppon a water vessell, out of which there run∣neth
<PB N="190" REF="104"/> abundance of pure cristall water, which afterward passeth along in trou∣ghes or gutters of Marble stone, &amp; hur∣teth no part of the pauement, the same gutters seruing also to kéepe fishe in, like as it were little fishpondes. Sure∣ly, I am of opinion, that aswell the auncient <HI>Romanes</HI> as <HI>Greekes,</HI> tear∣med in oulde time sutche buildinges <HI>Nymphaea,</HI> howbéeit this is but newe, and builded by one that was a councel∣ler vnto y<SUP>e</SUP> Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fifte, about the yéere of our Lorde, as some say, 1530. It hath on the one side the sea harde by, rounde aboute on the other∣sides a goodly plaine and open cuntrey, the plentifulnesse wherof is wounder∣full both of Corne, Oile, Wine, and all maner other good fruites. This which I will speake is hard to bée credited, &amp; yet it is true, that there bée some Vines found there the grapes whereof beyng pressed doo yéelde x. or xij. measures of wine, euerie measure contayning iiij. gallons and a halfe or rather more of oure Measures. And thys thynge
<PB N="191" REF="104"/> also may séeme straunge, which one hath reported in writing for a trueth, y<SUP>t</SUP> when the Northeast wind bloweth, there are brought into the Cuntrey of <HI>Naples</HI> out of <HI>Africa</HI> sutche abundance of Quailes, that they fall by heapes vp∣pon houses that bée néere to the Sea side, that men may easely take them in their hands. Yea, while they be in their course of flying, and bée wéeryed either wyth contrarie wyndes, or tempeste, or lengthe of the iourney, they lyght many times vpō some shippe, or gally. And laste of all to conclude, suche is the deliciousnes of the Realme of <HI>Naples,</HI> suche the magnificencie of y<SUP>e</SUP> buildings, sutche the holsomenesse of the welles and water, sutche plentie of all thinges whiche nature bryngeth foorthe into the worlde myraculous and straunge, sutche Monuments of Antiquities, and finally suche store of fruites, and other things wherwith mans life is sustai∣ned: it is that not only truly named to bee aa parte of the happye <HI>Campania,</HI> but is indéede the Wombe, as they saye, of fertilitie, and the fatte of
<PB N="192" REF="105"/> <HI>Italie</HI> and the verie horne of plentie, as is in the prouerbe. All which thinges when wée had viewed verie diligently, béeing not so muche wéeried with our labour and traueyll, as that wee iudged it time to retourne to our studies: (for the desire whiche wée had to sée these things, and the most delectable behol∣ding of them tooke away all wéerisom∣nesse) we departed from <HI>Naples,</HI> &amp; pas∣sing along by the most auncient Citie <HI>Caieta:</HI> wee came to <HI>Rome,</HI> and from thence we traueiled by the <HI>Tuskans</HI> to <HI>Padua.</HI> And when I had there arriued, I soiourned there a season, and afterwarde de∣parted into my natiue Cuntrey.</P>
