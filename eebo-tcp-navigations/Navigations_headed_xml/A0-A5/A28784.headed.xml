<P N="11">XI. Although in the preceeding Articles of this present Treaty, it be forbid to either Confederate to yield any aid or assistance to the Enemies of the o∣ther; yet it is not to be so understood, as if either Confederate having no War with the Enemies of the other, might not saile to, or traffick with the said Enemies, notwithstanding the other Confederate be in actuall war with them; But it is onely provided, That till a more particular agreement be made con∣cerning this matter, no goods called goods of <HI>Contra∣banda,</HI> a Catalogue and Specification of which shall be made within 4 months after the date hereof, shall be carried to the Enemies of each other without peril in case they be taken, of being adjudged lawful prize without hope of Restitution.</P>

<P N="13">XIII. In case it shall hereafter happen, that du∣ring this Amity and Confederation, any of the Peo∣ple or subjects of either, shall act or attempt any thing against the same or any part thereof, either by Land, Sea, or other waters, this Amity, Confederation and Allyance, shall not be thereupon interrupted or bro∣ken

<PB N="19" REF="11"/>commerce, be established, promoted, and as occasion is, defended against all the Disturbers thereof, who shall go about to interrupt, prohibit, hinder or re∣strain and limit the same to their own will and plea∣sure, in prejudice of the said Confederates. And ei∣ther part shall with all willingnesse or readiness, pro∣mote the good and prevent the hurt each of other; Saving the Treaties which either Nation hath made with other Kingdoms, Commonwealths &amp; Nations.

<P>AFter the <HI>Turks</HI> in <HI>Tunnis</HI> had given us an unsatis∣fied answer, we sailed to them again, and arrived
<PB N="30" REF="17"/>at <HI>Porta Ferina</HI> the 3 of <HI>April;</HI> when we came there the Officers met, and we sought to the Lord by Prayer, after which the Officers met in Counsel, and that day it was unanimously resolved by the Generalls and Captains, to set upon the Turks Ships there the next day, and to burn them. On the 4 of <HI>April</HI> we caused the Turks to flie before us, their Castle of <HI>Porta Ferina</HI> we battered, their strong Town and houses of stone we did beat about their ears: By break of day the whole fleet weighed anchor; The <HI>Newcastle</HI> Frigot went first in, after her the <HI>Kent,</HI> the <HI>Taunton,</HI> the <HI>Fore∣fight,</HI> the <HI>Amity, Princesse-Maria, Pearl, Mearmaid,</HI> and <HI>Merlin</HI> followed, and came to anchor neer the Turks 9 Ships who lay close to the Castle and Forts by it: Then came in the <HI>Andrew</HI> our Vice-Admirall, and the <HI>Plimouth,</HI> after them the <HI>George, Worcester, Ʋnicorn, Bridgwater,</HI> and <HI>Successe,</HI> these all anchored just against the Body of the Castle within musket shot, and began to play our broad sides of Guns at the Castle, which we plyed very thick for 4 or 5 hours; In the mean while our other Frigots sent their boats aboard the Ships to endeavor the firing of them, which by the blessing of God was done by 11 a clock; we had hot work of it, for their Ships lay within Pistoll shot of the shore, and all the Coast was lined with Musketeirs, and about 60 pieces of Ordnance mounted upon the Castle. The most men slain were in the Boats going aboard their Ships, which was by small shot, 30 is the most to be slain in the whole Fleet, and about 80 wounded; which considering the strength of the Place, and the many advantages the Turks had upon us, was but a small number. We are now in <HI>Tunnis</HI> Road, and Generall <HI>Blake</HI> hath sent once more a shore, but what will be done we know not.

And it is believed that <HI>Tripilo</HI> will do the like.</P>

<P>While from the height of our Apostolick Dignity we look round a∣bout us, and sollicitously survey the State of Things
<PB N="32" REF="18"/>throughout the World, as subjected to our Care and Charge, the Affairs of Christendom appear to be in a very sad and lamentable condition; for strangers make spoil of the Portion of the Lord, and his heri∣tage, casting out those that are indeed his Children. Those Nations, which out of our Fatherly love and tendernesse, we had a desire to take into our bosom, that is to say, into the bosom of true Religion, and most affectionately to embrace them, even they en∣deavor to rend and tear this very bosome in pieces; and making their way from the remotest parts of sea and land, have invaded the Flock of Christ. Yea and Catholick Princes disagreeing bend their Forces a∣gainst themselves, and (which is a Judgement that God threatned heretofore against our Enemies, and them that rise up against us) they devour one ano∣ther, and are made drunk with their own Blood, as it were with new wine. Whilst in time past, we were silently bewayling these things with our self, it see∣med good to him, who works things great and in∣comprehensible without number, to call us, unwil∣ling and trembling, to the Goverment of the Church; and to lay this immense burthen upon us, enough to make the strongest shoulders to shrink. What our sorrow hath been, we have testified by those publick prayers, which we enjoyned in all parts, as soon as we were advanced to the Supremacie; as also by those Letters which we sent to our most dear Sons, not onely to the Illustrious <HI>Ferdinand</HI> of <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Bohemia</HI> King, and Roman Emperor Elect, but also to the 2 Kings, and which with griefe of heart we wrote a second time, when we perceived our most deadly Enemy designing ruine and destruction to all <HI>Europe,</HI> by distressing the most renowned Republick,
<PB N="33" REF="18"/>to the end that we might turn them from mutuall discords, against so dangerous an Adversary; and now also we send againe, admonishing them, that whilst their Armies are at a stand, during this winter season, they would use their utmost endeavor to settle Peace. Let all these things bear witnesse for us, that seeing there remains no hope to mittigate so great and sore evills, save onely in common concord, it is the main care that takes up our Mind night and day, to insinuate it into the hearts and affections of all men. But because this is not to be effected by humane strength and earthly wisdome, but ought to be ex∣pected from him as his gift, upon whom rests the discipline of our Peace, who takes away the Spirit of Princes, and rebuketh the Sea, and it is Still; there∣fore doe you <HI>(Venerable Brethren, and Beloved Sons)</HI> strive as much as in you lies, not onely by your en∣deavour, study, Counsel, duties, and Authority, but also rent your hearts in prayer, in tears, in fastings, and Alms deeds, take ye the Censor of Incense, that is, the prayer of the Saints; and stand ye in the gap be∣twixt the Fire, and the people that are ready to be consumed. You who are set to be watchmen upon the walls of <HI>Hierusalem,</HI> cry aloud night and day, and be ye the Appeasers of divine wrath and vengeance. Empty out the Cup of Fury and destruction, the Cup of anguish and of tribulation without mixture, with which we have been drunken. We for our part, to whom Christ thought not his sheep safely commit∣ted, till we were again and the third time admonished in <HI>Peter</HI> touching the greatnesse of his Love, to whom alone it is given to enter the Sanctuary, and to present the prayers of the people to God before the Altar, conceive it our duty with all diligence
<PB N="34" REF="19"/>to labour, that the Lord may not be angry, and say, <HI>I sought a man to make up the Breach, and to plead with me for the earth, that I might not destroy it, and I found him not, therefore have I powred out mine indignation upon them.</HI> For this is the property of divine vengeance, that he who is the most high, is then most easie to be entreated, and returns to gentlenesse and mercy, that is, to his own nature, when he draweth the sword with his mighty Arm and strong hand, to the end that he may strike. Let your Feet be the Feet of those that bring the glad Tidings of the Gospell of Peace, that the Bowes and Arrows may be broken in pieces, and that God may command the winds, and cause Peace and Tranquility; which by your assistance especially we desire to obtain, and doe most affectionately confer upon you our Apostoli∣call Benediction.</P>

<P>I Shall acquaint you with the manner of the en∣trance of the Queen of <HI>Sweden</HI> into this City. The Archduke of <HI>Tirol</HI> having many months since been advertised of the Queens intention, to passe through this City, resolved to give her an extraordinary noble entertainment. To this end he sent Letters to all the
<PB N="35" REF="19"/>Gentry and Nobility in this Country, and to his Friends in the parts adjacent, to wait upon him in their bravery at his Court on Saturday last. In the evening the Archduke having intelligence that the Queen would lodge within 9 mile of this City, took Post with his brother the Archbishop, and a dozen Gentlemen, and onely kist her hands, bidding her welcom into his Dominions, and returned back hi∣ther the same night. The next day, being Sunday, about 4 in the afternoon, 12 of the Archdukes Trum∣petters, and most of the aforesaid Nobility and Gen∣try rode before him, the Archdutchess, which is the Duke of <HI>Florence</HI> his Sister, being carried after him in a rich Sedan, the rest of the Gentry about and behind her; then followed his Guard on Horsback, being 50 Firelocks, his ordirnary Guard with Halberts stan∣ding on each side of the way: and in this equipage he met the Queen about a mile from the City; about 20 yeards before he came at her he light off his horse, and she out of her Sedan, and saluted one another; and so in the former manner, with Trumpets, Drums, and other loud Musick very fine, she entred the City.</P>
<P>The next day I saw her at dinner onely with the Archduke, his Lady, and Brother, which was very magnificent: I made account to have seen her at supper, but she supped privately; yet being at the Court, I was told, That the Queen the next day would make open profession of the Catholick Faith in the Franciscans or Archdukes Chappell, which not onely I, but all her Protestant Servants much admired at, and would not believe; but it proved true: For on the Wednesday between a 11 and 12 of clock, she was led to the aforesaid Church
<PB N="36" REF="20"/>by the Archduke, attended by the company afore∣said, and seated upon a Canopy on the left hand be∣fore the High Alter; below her, a little toward her right hand, was the Archduke, and his Lady, and Brother; and over against them the Spanish Ambas∣sador in a Chair by himselfe; all the Quire being hung with Crimson Velvet, and the ground covered with red Serge: Then Mr. <HI>Holstenius,</HI> who was sent as the Popes Nuntio, stood at the right side of the Al∣tar, and said, That Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the VII, having understood that <HI>Christina</HI> Queen of <HI>Sweden,</HI> being en∣lightned by the Holy Ghost, had intent to put her self into the bosom of the Church, had sent his Letters to testifie his Approbation of her desires, and to receive her with his Apostolicall Benediction, therefore he was there to know, whether it were true or not; up∣on which she made answer, that it was so. Then he gave the Popes Letter to a Priest that stood by, who red it aloud to the effect abovesaid; the Letter being read, Mr. <HI>Holstenius</HI> desired that in Testimony of the truth, she would make Profession of the said Catholick Apostolick, and Roman Faith, and swear to keep it upon the Holy Evangelists, before the Archduke and the Spanish Ambassodor, which she did, and kissed the Book. Then was a Chair for <HI>Holstenius</HI> to sit in, and a Cushion laid at his Feet, upon which the Queen kneeled, and he making the sign of the Crosse over her head, and embracing her shoulders, said, That he did receive her into the Catholick Church, and by virtue of Order from the Holy Father, Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the VII, and from power given by Christ, whose Vicar he was, he did absolve her from all her sins that she had committed, In the Name of the Father, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Then were certain short Prayers said (or rather sung) in
<PB N="37" REF="20"/>Latine for her; after which, High Masse was sung, and then a Priest made a Sermon in Dutch, his Text was out of the <HI>Psalms. Hear O my Daughter, incline also thine ear, forget also thy people and thy Fathers house; so shall the King have pleasure in thy Beauty.</HI> Then was <HI>Te Deum</HI> sung with most excellene Voices; and fifty peeces of Ordnance discharged, and so she retur∣ned home as she came.</P>

<P><HI>Sect.</HI> 1. I Doe firmly admit and embrace Apostoli∣call and Ecclesiasticall Traditions, and the other Observances and Constitutions of the Church. Also I admit the holy Scriptures according to that
<PB N="38" REF="21"/>sence which our holy Mother the Church, to whom it belongs to judge of the true sence and interpreta∣tion of holy Scriptures, hath held, and doth hold: neither will I ever take and interpret it but according to the unanimous consent of the Fathers.</P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> 2. I doe professe also that there be truly and properly seven Sacraments of the new Law instituted by our Lord Jesus Christ, and necessary to the salva∣tion of mankind, though all be not necessary for every man; that is to say, Baptism, Confirmation, the Eucharist, Penance, Extream unction, Order, and Matrimony; and that they confer grace: and of these Baptism, Confirmation and Order cannot be reiterated without Sacriledge: Also the received and approved Rites of the Catholick Church used in the solemn administration of all the aforesaid Sacra∣ments, I receive and admit.</P>

<P>And Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI> in his Description of the American Islands, saith of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> It is in length from East to West about 50 leagues, and in breadth 20, the whole compasse estimated at 150. The middle of it under the 18 Degree of Northern latitude: of a rich Soil, abundantly provided of all things necessary, well stocked with cattell, and no lesse plentifully stored with most sorts of fruits, which either industry or na∣ture have supplyed it with; great store of Cotton∣wool, and such a bundance of Jaccu (a Root where∣of the Savages once made their bread) that it was deemed the Granary of the neighboring Islands.</P>
<P>The Island <HI>Jamaica</HI> belongeth properly to the Duke of <HI>Veragus,</HI> who is lineally descended from <HI>Christopher Columbus,</HI> the Discoverer of the Indies, and not to the Duke of <HI>Medina,</HI> as was by some con∣ceived.</P>
<P>The chief Ports of this Island are (1) <HI>Caguaya</HI> which serves to the Town of St. <HI>Jago de la Vega,</HI> or St. <HI>James</HI> of the Plains, from whence it is about two leagues distant.</P>
<P>The second Port of any note on that Southside, is <HI>Esquyvel,</HI> which is about three leagues distant from the former towards the West, which though the Chan∣nell be, as of the former, difficult to find, is within a commodious Haven; and in respect of an Arm of
<PB N="43" REF="23"/>the Sea which affords the Commodity of building of Shipping; within it is of singular commodity to the Island. This Arm of the Sea extends it selfe a full league within the Land, where it admits into it a small fresh Brook, called <HI>Ell Rio de la Puente,</HI> which arising within two leagues of the Town of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> and passing pleasantly through the <HI>Savanas,</HI> is recei∣ved by the Arm before described, which is called <HI>Guavayera.</HI> The Land between the Town of St. <HI>Jago</HI> and this place, is for the most part open, and <HI>Savana</HI> land, well stored with cattell and horses. From thence to <HI>Maccario,</HI> which is about six leagues distant the Coast, is good and fit for Anchoring; but affords no Port or Harbour nearer then <HI>Panda Botellio,</HI> which is a round Mountain, about a league to the West of which, a River called <HI>Mantinesse</HI> discharges it selfe into the Sea: This River arises about a league, or a league and halfe with the land, and abounds in fish, and is well stored with cattell, upon the neighbour∣ing <HI>Hatos,</HI> and <HI>Savanas</HI> of <HI>Tama</HI> and <HI>Guatibacoa.</HI> Thence passing along this Coast, the next place of goodnesse of Land, or conveniency of Anchoring. And about eight leagues distant from <HI>Peccaria,</HI> is <HI>Punta de la Gostus,</HI> which is in the Hato of <HI>Perada,</HI> which is one of the best and largest pieces of <HI>Savana</HI> of the whole Island, it being four leagues in length and more.</P>
<P>From <HI>Pereda</HI> to <HI>Elconde,</HI> another little Port is five leagues, between which two places falls into the Sea the great River <HI>Caphana,</HI> which arising in the Moun∣tains, passes through <HI>Savanas</HI> of the same name, well stored with cattell; and leaving the open land about a league from the Sea, runs through wooddy and manguey, or mountainous grounds, and is from the
<PB N="44" REF="24"/>very <HI>Savana,</HI> of depth sufficient for most ordinary Ships, but narrow, as being over grown by the Man∣groves, for want of use or clearing; yet contains in the narrowest about sixty or seventy foot of breadth. At the mouth this River receives into it certain large Brooks of fresh water; but of no other consideration then for fishing onely, whereof it affords a plentifull commodity. The mouth of this River, by reason of the smalnesse of its fall, is barred with the sands, so that unlesse at some times of considerable flouds, it hath not depth above four foot upon the Bar, but without is Anchoring good enough in the open Road, but harbour none at all.</P>
<P>Next about two leagues distant, is <HI>El Eaido,</HI> which is a <HI>Hata,</HI> having some small <HI>Savanas,</HI> but very great plenty of cattell abiding in the Woods, which the Spaniards call <HI>Ganadus Siniarones,</HI> or wild cattell, as being not marked, nor belonging to any certaine proprietor, other then the chief Lord and owner of the <HI>Hato.</HI> In this <HI>Hato</HI> is a small Port called <HI>Puto del Conde,</HI> of no great value or consideration.</P>
<P>Thence to <HI>Punto Negrillio,</HI> is no other Port or Har∣bour whatsoever; but passing by land, is a <HI>Hato</HI> cal∣led <HI>Cabnico,</HI> large and well stored with cattell, both wild and tame.</P>
<P>Thence next is called the <HI>Savana</HI> of the Sea, which reaches to the Cape <HI>Negrillio.</HI> From the <HI>Puerto de Cuguaya</HI> towards the East, is the <HI>Hato de Loguany,</HI> which is at the East side of the Port it selfe, and pre∣sents to the Harbour a large and well stored <HI>Savana,</HI> with an Arm of the Port extending to it, commodi∣ous for the building of Shipping, there being store both of Cedars and other sort of Timber convenient for that purpose.</P>
<PB N="45" REF="24"/>
<P>Next Eastward Land to this of <HI>Lyguany,</HI> is <HI>Lezania,</HI> a narrow tract of plantable land between the sea and the mountain, containing some small Savanas, but no habitation, nor any Cattell but wild, and is about two leagues in length.</P>
<P>Then is the <HI>Hato Ayala</HI> full of tame cattle, and hath much commodity of planting, or erecting of Sugar Engenios of water, by reason of two convenient Ri∣vers which it hath running through, is fit for that purpose; but is dangerously open to the incursion of Pirats, who there have too much commodity of landing in two small Cores or Bighs of Land, the one of which is called <HI>los Anaones,</HI> towards the West of this <HI>Hato,</HI> and to the East <HI>la Cruz del Padre.</HI></P>

<P>WE left <HI>Barbadoes</HI> the last of <HI>March,</HI> and came to St. <HI>Christophers,</HI> where we found a Regiment formed, which we received into our company, not staying to anchor. Thence passing forward, we came in sight of <HI>Sancta Luz, Porto Rico,</HI> and some other I∣lands, and on ther 3 of <HI>April</HI> arived before <HI>Sancto Do∣mingo,</HI> part of our forces landing within six miles of the Town, without any opposition, but the main of the Army landed near 40 miles beyond it, contrary to what was intended; which fell out in respect of the absence of the Pilot, who being sent out to dis∣cover, returned not in time. This occasioned a very long march for the Army through Woods and nar∣row Lanes, and all without any guide; which with the heate of the weather, and want of water, put the Army into some weaknesse and distemper, and made them very unfit for service. The Souldiers likewise stragled from their Colours to gather Oranges, Lem∣mons, Pines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the extraordinary eating whereof put many of them into the Flux, and Feavers. In this condition we advanced near the Town, where our forelorn, being surprised by an Ambush, and their Leader Adjurant Generall <HI>Jackson</HI> running away, were put to a retreat by 300 men; and there Major Generall <HI>Heans</HI> keeping his ground, was slain. This Ambuscado was afterwards routed by some of the Sea-men, who came up to relieve the Forlorn. <HI>Iack∣son</HI> was cashiered for cowardize, and had his sword broken over his head.</P>
<PB N="48" REF="26"/>
<P>After this, the Army retreating for some refresh∣ment, it was thought most convenient by the Officers, and most for the service, to leave that Iland (the Ar∣my being weakned by their aforesaid long march) and to attempt the Iland of <HI>Iamaica:</HI> And having shipped the Army, we arived there uppon the 10 of <HI>May,</HI> and took the Town of <HI>St. Iago de la Vega,</HI> having beat the Enemy from their Forts and Ordnance, who were got together in a body, consisting of about 3000 men. And from this place nothing did divert our first atrempt, but that it had not a name in the world; for we find the Country equall, if not supe∣riour to <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> and in four miles march here, we saw more Cattle and Plantations then in fourty in <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> and a better aire; and the scituation there∣of much more advantagious to all purposes. We are now getting horses, whereof there are great a∣bundance in the Island to make Troopers and Dra∣goons, to pursue the Enemy, who are fled unto the Woods, and endeavour to get away into the Island of <HI>Cuba,</HI> twenty leagues from this; for prevention whereof we have laid some Frigots in the way. The Fleet got safe into the Harbor, which is indeed a very safe and gallant one for riding in all winds. We find here Ebony in great plenty, store of large Cattle, and Timber in abundance for shipping, and some ships on the stocks in building; the Ground very Fertile, and full of brave Plains and Rivers. There is like∣wise great store of Salt-Peter, which some men among us, who are Powder men of <HI>London,</HI> doe affirme, may be had as good and as plentifully, as in any place in the world, and in three years time they will under∣take to serve <HI>England</HI> with it, woods and Rivers for carriage being easie here, with choice places to erect

<P>We lost in <HI>Hispaniola</HI> between two and three hun∣dred men by sicknesse and Skirmishes with the ene∣my, and killed in the Woods by the Cow-killers, as they were stragling to gather fruit.

<HEAD>Here followeth another Letter from the Fleet in <HI>Jamaica</HI> Harbour, concerning our Affairs in the West-Indies.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>June 25. 1656.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IN the last to you dated the 12 of <HI>March,</HI> by the conveyance of the <HI>Grantham,</HI> we intimated the de∣parture of some Frigats for the Maine, which since returned with Intelligence onely of 7 ships in the Harbour of <HI>Carthagene.</HI> A few dayes after, A Council of War was called, and it was thought expedient to move upon some designe for the advantage of the Commonwealth rather than lie still in Harbour. In order to which, eleven of the best sailing Frigats in the Fleet were chosen out for the effecting of our purpose (the Admiral himself to command in chief.)
<PB N="51" REF="27"/>The Port we were bound for, proved to be <HI>Rio de la Hache,</HI> a Town about 30 Leagues to the Eastward of <HI>Sancta Martha.</HI> We landed 500 Seamen a mile West∣ward of the Town, where they saluted us from the Fort standing to the Eastward with three great shot, but did no execution; whereupon we marched boldly forward, and by the advantage of some houses near adjoyning, we got thither, and played our small shot into the Fort so fast, that they soon deserted their great Gunns, and begged for Quarter, which was presently granted; the Fort was 19 foot high, with a Brest-work on the top, and 4 brasse Guns mounted: The Inhabitants had sent away all their Goods by their Negroes upon their first espiall of us, which was 5 hours before we landed. We stayed there 3 or 4 days, and sent severall Parties up into the Country in quest of the Enemy, but took none save one Frier, and some Spanish women and Ne∣groes. In the mean time, severall came down with Flags of Truce, and gave us notice, that the Gover∣nour of the place would come and compound for them▪ but they failed at the prefixed time; where∣fore Orders were given for carrying aboard the Spa∣nish prisoners (women excepted) and the Town to be immediately fired, and our Forces drawn off.</P>
<P>After all matters were dispatched here, we set sail to <HI>Sancta Martha</HI> to review our former spoiles. We drew out the same party, and went on shore, no Ene∣my opposing, most persons of Quality being fled to <HI>Carthagene</HI> for security. We soon left the place after we had watered; and espying a Saile at Sea, in few hours we came up with her, and found her to be a Spanish Prize laden with Oyle, Olives, Wine, Stuffs, to a good value.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="28"/>
<P>Then we moved towards <HI>Carthagene</HI> to shew our selves; we lay there one day, and then 8 of the Fleet departed for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> leaving three of us behind in our former station, 6 leagues Eastward of <HI>Carthagene.</HI> In their way they chased another Ship laden with Cocoes, and took her, and have sent the Fruit to the Lord Protector: it is good to make Chocolette, which is a great Drink in these Countries.</P>
<P>We that were behind after the rest of the Fleet, two Evenings together near Sun-set, made another Saile; but night approaching, we lost sight of her, and the next day saw her at Anchor under <HI>Carthagene</HI> wall. We attempted to bring our Ships near her; but they discovering our intents, haled her ashore, cutting their Cables; so that we being Ships of great burthen, had not depth of Water, besides the danger of the Forts. We gave the Town a strong Alarm, coming within shot, but they fired no Guns. So we left our chase, and with the advantage of a Westerly wind (which is not usuall here) we got up as high as <HI>Sancta Martha,</HI> and so stood over for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> leaving the other two Ships behind, where they chased another Vessell into the shore, which suffered shipwrack there, laden with Tobacco, Hides, and Cocoes.</P>
<P>Severall Gentlemen from the Governour of <HI>Mevis</HI> have been here to view this Island of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> in or∣der to their Transplanting, who approve of the Ground very well, and are upon their Return with three of the States ships, to fetch the Governor, and their Families, and Estates.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Honorable,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFter my service presented to your Honors, these are to acquaint you, that upon the 8 instant at night it blew hard Westerly, by means whereof we
<PB N="54" REF="29"/>with our Squadrons (onely the <HI>Providence</HI> was gone to water) weighed out of the Bay of <HI>Cadiz</HI> and plyed to Sea; in the evening we espied eight Sail some five or six leagues to the Westwards of <HI>Cadiz,</HI> we using the best means we could to meet with them the next day, which we did. It being little wind at N.E it was nine of the clock before we came up with them, but having a fresh gale in the night, all but we and the <HI>Bridgwater</HI> were to the Leeward, and could not come to us. But when we came to the Fleet, it proved to be the Spanish Fleet come from the West-Indies, which were four of the King of <HI>Spains,</HI> three Mer∣chant-men, and one Prize which they had taken by way of the Western Islands being a Portugall, which were eight in all: We engaged the Fleet, but being within four leagues of <HI>Cadiz,</HI> could not stay for our ships, but we, the <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> and <HI>Plymouth,</HI> engaged them, and had a sharp dispute some of us; but the Admirall being the smallest ship, we sleighted her, for we conceived there was some Pollicy used in the Flag, by which means their Admiral and the <HI>Portugall</HI> Prize got into <HI>Cadiz;</HI> the Vice-Admirall and one more we sunk, and burnt two: We took one, the Captain of her, which we have on board, saith she hath in her two Millions of silver; the Vice-Admi∣rall had as much, I doe believe. The <HI>Plimouth</HI> chased another, who ran ashore between S. <HI>Peters</HI> and <HI>Cape Degar,</HI> but it seems by the prisoners information she had no silver in her; the ship we took was as good as all the Fleet besides: the other that Captain <HI>Harman</HI> hath taken is very rich, but little silver in her. Both the Prize and our ship are sorely wounded both in Mast and Hull. The Commanders advise me not to take the silver out of her, I doe intend to take further
<PB N="55" REF="29"/>advice about it; there is no News, onely the Fleet I believe will follow us. The Gallies came out be∣cause of the riches and disability of our ships: we will come towards you except your Honours send further orders, for we are in no capacity to stay here. I shall leave two or three of the best sayling ships off the Cape, and I and the rest will come to <HI>Lisbone,</HI> where I hope to find your Honours. There is the <HI>Nova Spaniola</HI> Fleet at the <HI>Havana,</HI> but when they will come home is not known. This is all, onely there is losse of men in some ships, the number I know not. I am,</P>

<HEAD>An Account touching the great Destruction befallen the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the West-Indies.</HEAD>
<P>THE eldest son of the Marquesse of <HI>Badex</HI> (who was taken prisoner by our Fleet in the Spanish Vice-Admirall, as they came with their Silver from the West-Indies) being examined, saith upon his Examination: That above five months since, pre∣sently after his Father and Family departed out of <HI>Lima</HI> in <HI>Peru,</HI> there hapned a fearfull Earthquake and most miraculous Raine of fire from heaven in <HI>Peru,</HI> insomnch that the whole City of <HI>Lima</HI> is swallowed up and destroyed, and also the City of <HI>Calao;</HI> in which places there perished above twelve thousand Spaniards, and (to see the great distinguishing hand of God) not above one hundred Indians with them. In that City also, <HI>viz. Lima,</HI> the King of <HI>Spain</HI> hath lost by the Earthquake, one hundred Millions of Silver ready wrought up. Moreover, the famous
<PB N="57" REF="30"/>Mines and Mountains of <HI>Potosi</HI> (out of which they digged their Silver) are destroyed in a wonderfull manner, so that there is no more of Hills to be seen, but all plaine, nor is there any further possibility of having Gold or Silver in <HI>Peru.</HI> Some of the Spanish themselves doe acknowledge, that this desolation and destruction hath befaln the Spaniards for the Cruelties by them acted upon the poor Indians, they not sparing even those Indians among them who professed the Roman Catholick Religion, insomuch that the miserable Creatures being beyond measure oppressed, and grieved with their sufferings, cryed to Heaven for vengeance against them. Never was there a more terible visible hand of God in judgment upon any people since the time of <HI>Sodome</HI> and <HI>Gomor∣rah.</HI> Great is the Lord, marvellous are his doings, and to be had in reverence of all the Nations round about.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="narrative">
<HEAD>Here followeth the Narrative of the great Successe given by God to a few of our Ships against the King of <HI>Spains</HI> West-India Fleet.</HEAD>
<P>SEven Ships in the service of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> (being four of the Kings own Fleet, and three Merchants) coming from the West Indies, most of them richly laden with Gold Silver, Pearl, and other Commodities, <HI>viz.</HI> The Admirall, <HI>Don Marquesse Del porto</HI> Generall; The vice Admirall a Gallion, <HI>Don Francisco De Esquevel</HI> Commander; The Rere Admirall a Gallion, <HI>Don Francisco Del Hayo</HI> Comman∣der, a ship commanded by Captaine <HI>John Rhodrignes Caldron,</HI> a ship Commanded by Capt. <HI>John De la Tour,</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="31"/>another small man of war, and a Vessell of Advice from the <HI>Vice Roy</HI> of <HI>Mexico</HI> to <HI>Spain:</HI> They did in fifty eight days proceed so far as within a few leagues of <HI>Cadiz,</HI> without making Land or touching at any place during the voyage, having in their way betwixt the Western Islands and <HI>Massagam</HI> in <HI>Affrick,</HI> seized upon a small <HI>Portugall</HI> as Prize, by whom receiving a false information, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had beaten the <HI>English</HI> Fleet from off their Coast, a month before; they sayled with much confidence towards <HI>Cadiz</HI> as not expecting opposition.</P>
<P>The greatest part of the <HI>English</HI> Fleet, were at this time gone to the Bay of <HI>Wyers</HI> in <HI>Portugall</HI> (where they arrived the eleventh of <HI>September</HI> last) to recruit their wants, and to be in a way of further Orders, the Generalls leaving behind them a Squadron of six or seven Ships (to have an eye upon <HI>Cadiz</HI>) under the command of Captain <HI>Stayner,</HI> Captain of the <HI>Speaker</HI> Frigot: which Squadron on the eight of <HI>September</HI> last, plying to Sea, being forced thither by a strong Westerly winde, did at the evening of the day Discover the said Spanish Fleet, five or six Leagues to the Westward of <HI>Cadiz;</HI> And the ap∣proach of the night denying opportunity of present action, they endeavoured to fall in with them the next day, which accordingly they did about nine of the clock in the morning (they seeming to the Spa∣niards to be Fisher-boats) But there being a fresh Gale that night, all but three of the Squadron were to the Leeward, and could not presently come in, and finding it to be the Spanish Fleet come from the Indies, the <HI>Speaker,</HI> the <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> and the <HI>Plymouth</HI> Frigots (not thinking it adviseable to stay for the rest of the squadron, they being within 4 leagues of <HI>Cadiz</HI>)
<PB N="59" REF="31"/>engaged with the Fleet, and a sharp dispute there was betwixt them: The Admirall being a small ship, and it being conceived that the placing of the Flag upon her, might be in pollicy to divert them from attending the Ships of better value, they sligh∣ted her, and suffered her (with the <HI>Portugall</HI> Prize) to go into <HI>Cadiz</HI> Bay, where (its said) she was run on shore and sunk, being reported to have in her Six hun∣dred thousand pieces of Eight: The Vice Admirall (being reported to have Six hundred thousand pieces of Eight; besides in Jewells and Plate, upon the ac∣compt of the Marquesse of <HI>Badex,</HI> to the value of five hundred thousand pieces of Eight) having fought six hours, was taken by our Ships, and after set on fire by the Spaniards themselves, and so burnt down, and snnk, in her were destroyed one hundred and ten men, the principallest of whom was the Marquesse of <HI>Badex,</HI> who with his wife and eldest daughter were burnt: The Rear Admirall was taken and remains in our possession: The ship under the command of Captain <HI>John Rodrignes Caldron,</HI> which was said to have in her Sugar, Tobacco and Plate, to the value of Six hundred thousand pieces of Eight, was taken, and in the bringing off was by an accidentall fire burnt and sunk: The ship under the command of <HI>De La Tour,</HI> twelve thousand West India Hides, and some quantities of Sugar, is taken and in our posses∣sion: The small Man of War (having in her the like lading with the last mentioned) and the Advice Vessell being of no force or lading, are said to escape into <HI>Gibralter.</HI></P>
<P>The value of what is taken and possessed, is not justly known; but by the Calculation of the Spani∣ards there are taken and lost about Nine Millions of
<PB N="60" REF="32"/>pieces of Eight: besides the said Ships and their La∣ding, there are many prisoners taken, three hundred and fifty being found in the Rear Admiral, and about Ninety saved out of the Vice Admirall, amongst whom there are the Eldest Son, a younger son, and two daughters of the said Marquess of <HI>Badex,</HI> as also <HI>Don Diego De Villa Alva,</HI> the Governour of the <HI>Havana,</HI> and severall others of quality, and Merchants.</P>
<P>And all this was done without the losse of one Vessell of the <HI>English,</HI> so it pleased the wisdome of God, to chuse to effect so great a work, by a little force: As also by suffering the Enemy to be foolish∣ly ensnared into a presumptious confidence, by an Enemies information, on which they so relyed, that they neglected the haling of a Vessell which came from St. <HI>Lucaz,</HI> and might have informed them of the truth.</P>
<P>By this <HI>Narrative</HI> we see that the Lord whose right hand hath been heret ofore so glorious in power, for the help of his poor people in these Nations, in the time of their saddest dangers, when their Enemies at home expected to have satisfied their Lusts in their ruine, hath again appeared on their behalfe in this day of their need by blowing with his winds, and causing the Sea to cover their Enemies abroad, so that they have sunk as Lead into the mighty waters, which gives abundant cause to say, <HI>who is like unto the Lord,</HI> for he hath triumphed Gloriously; and as the Eminency of this Mercy, in weakning the com∣mon Enemy of Religion (the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> with whom this Commonwealth is engaged in a just and necessary war) and in encouraging and strengthning the hands of his Servants, in a vigorous prosecution of that engagement, is much heightned by the freenes of <GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1+ pages" DISP="〈1+ pages missing〉"/></P>
