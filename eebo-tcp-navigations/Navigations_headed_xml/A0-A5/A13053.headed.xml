Brethren-Senators in the state of so famous a City; All of them
being my Honorable and worthy Masters:
A. M. Wisheth the fruition of all temporall Felicities in this life; and the
never-failing fulnesse of blessednesse in the life to come.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>RIGHT HONORABLE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>His famous City hath now enioyed the
peacefull succession of more than one
and thirty worthy Lord Maiors, since
Master <HI>Iohn Stow</HI> (the painfull Searcher
into Reverend Antiquity) did first pre∣sent
LONDONS SVRVEY to this Ho∣nourable
Senate, Sir <HI>Robert Lee,</HI> then
Lord Maior, with gracious and favourable acceptance.</P>
<P>Who purposing to adde increase to this Worke (accor∣ding
to the dignity of the Subiect) but prevented by infir∣mity,
and Sicknesse-bringing Death, imparted not only his
good Intentions, but best Collections also unto me, by his
importunacy now perswaded both to correct the Errors,
and perfect so well deserving a VVorke: And had his re∣quest
beene wanting, the respect and honour I owe to this
Royall City (the tender Mother and Nurse to us both)
had beene incitement enough to further a Booke of such
consequence, as far as my weake abilities would give leave.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>
Having therefore at first drawne a briefe Discourse there∣of,
lest I might unadvisedly dash on the Rocks of Displea∣sure,
I delivered it to the Right VVorshipfull, Sir <HI>Henry
Mountague,</HI> then Recorder of <HI>London,</HI> by whom com∣manded
to appeare before your Worships in the Councell
Chamber at <HI>Guild-Hall,</HI> I received Encouragement and
Authority, with promise of helpe and furtherance, to per∣fect
this worthy Monument. VVhich accordingly (after
the care and paines of twelve yeeres travell about it) I pre∣sented
unto this Honourable Senate, in the yeere 1618.</P>
<P>But now that I might adde a Complement to this <HI>Survey,</HI>
which might best become it, have I done my diligent en∣devour
(unto which have I called the assistance of other
learned Antiquaries) to set downe Methodically,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. D.</NOTE> the Ori∣ginall,
Increase, Moderne Estate, and Government of this
City; as also by what Name, or Office rather, whether of
<HI>Port-graves, Port-reeves, Barons, Provosts,</HI> or <HI>Bayliffes,</HI>
the Governours, Rulers, and Magistrates were anciently
distinguished.</P>
<P>Before all other, I find the name of Alderman, well wor∣thy
observation, as being derived from most venerable An∣tiquity:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbd. in Brit.</NOTE> For ancient Records say, that in the dayes of King
<HI>Edgar,</HI> there was a worthy Noble man, of the Blood Roy∣all,
named <HI>Ailwine,</HI> in great authority and favour with
the King, insomuch that he was therefore termed, <HI>Healf-Koning,</HI>
as much to say, as <HI>Halfe-King;</HI> and by Office was
stiled, <HI>Alderman of all England:</HI> as appeares by this Epi∣taph
engraven on his Tombe, in that Famous Monastery
(by him founded) in the <HI>Ile of Ely:</HI></P>
<P>Hic requiescit D. Ailwinus, incliti Regis Edgari Cognatus,
totius Angliae Aldermannus, &amp; huius sacri Coenobii mira∣culosus
Fundator.</P>
<P>Here resteth Lord <HI>Ailwine,</HI> Cousin to the Noble King <HI>Ed∣gar,
Alderman of all England,</HI> and miraculous Founder
of this holy Abbey.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>
VVhich plainly sheweth, that in those times of ancient
and venerable respect, this Title of <HI>Alderman,</HI> was only gi∣ven,
for a further addition of Repute and Honour.</P>
<P>Some Authors have delivered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Math. Paris. Geffery Monm. Will, Malmes. Pol▪ Virgil.</NOTE> that men bearing such a
Stile, were sometimes called <HI>Doomesmen,</HI> sometimes <HI>Ealder∣men,
Judges of the Kings Courts, &amp;c.</HI> As being distinguished
by those additions of Honour and Esteeme from other men,
for their greater maturity of Iudgement, gravity of yeeres,
experience and person; and therefore the fitter for weighty
imployment in the State-affaires, by apt correspondency of
their trust and fidelity. Which name of dignity declaring
the most eminent degree of Magistracy, doth still (as here∣tofore
it hath) extend it selfe thorowout all <HI>England,</HI> in Ci∣ties,
Townes, and Corporations; and in some the <HI>Alderman</HI>
only is the chiefe Commander: Even so is it much more
Maiesticall here, in the supreme City of the whole Land,
<HI>London,</HI> the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of <HI>Great Britaine,</HI> the Mother of
authentike Memory, the Ancient and Moderne Seat of our
Kings, yea, the very Chamber Royall for Maiesty it selfe,
and the open Haven for all Merchandise and Commerce,
as being the rich Store-house of Peace and Plenty.</P>
<P>It shall be needlesse to trouble your Honour, and the rest
of my worthy Masters, with repetition here of those Officers
and Governours, that ruled this Great City in elder times,
because you shall finde them sufficiently set downe in their
apt and distinct places, untill this higher degree of Honour
came to full perfection, I meane the <HI>Maioralty,</HI> which some
hold to be in King <HI>Iohns</HI> time, but most maintaine &amp; avouch
it to bee in the first yeere of King <HI>Richard</HI> the first, whose
Vertue and Courage won him the name of <HI>Cueur-de-lion.</HI>
From which happy beginning, it hath neither beene mine,
nor my most industrious and helpfull Friends good fortune,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. W.</NOTE>
to ranke downe in formall order the successive line of the
<HI>Sheriffes, Maiors,</HI> and <HI>Aldermen,</HI> according to my former
intended purpose, concerning their Birth-place, and Paren∣tage;
nor how many of them this Honourable City it selfe
<PB REF="4"/>
then yeelded, as challenging them her owne Off-spring, she
being as well a loving Mother to breed them in her owne
Bowels, as a carefull Nurse afterward to bring them up.</P>
<P>For my selfe, <HI>Londons</HI> Off-spring, though the meanest,
yet hold I it no small attribute of Honour to record it, how
much more Glory then for you (equall in worth and ranke)
to reade it, and what comfort for Posterity to remember and
acknowledge it, that this Ancient, Famous, and Renowned
Mother City, never wanted from time to time Honourable
Sonnes of her owne bearing and breeding, to sit at Sterne, to
undergoe all Offices of Credit and Authority, yea, even the
Maioralty, from Father to Son in the third Generation;
and they to boast their Grandfathers, and great Grandfa∣thers,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Witnesse</HI> Garrards. Bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es. Rowe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Branch, &amp;c.</NOTE> borne &amp; bred in this worthy City, some to the fourth,
others the third, but many the second Generation, as in the
Reportary following will more at large appeare.</P>
<P>I forbeare to speake of such as have beene Aldermen and
Sheriffes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Witnesse <HI>Barnhams,</HI> Fa∣ther and Son.</NOTE> first, the Fathers; then, the Sonnes; yet neither li∣ving
to enioy the Maioralties Dignity. As also what flu∣ent
plenty of Magistrates in the same high Office, the seve∣rall
Sheirffes of <HI>England</HI> have yeelded, wherewith the said
Discourse will more familiarly acquaint you.</P>
<P>And now, let me beseech your Honour and VVorships,
to allow this <HI>Survey of London</HI> your gracious entertainment;
and the rather, for that it now comes in a fairer Volume than
ever, replete with plenty and enlargement of memorable
<HI>Additions,</HI> not only with the splendor of <HI>Armes,</HI> and other
glorious Ensignes of Honour, but with speciall observations
of venerable <HI>Antiquity,</HI> and infinite supplements of Ancient
and Moderne Monuments, as well of the Churches in the
famous Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster,</HI> as in foure miles
compasse round about them, such as before this instant were
never published.</P>

<HEAD>To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat I may give you a reason of such things as the Iudicious and se∣vere
Censurer may deeme blemishes and imperfections in this
<HI>Worke:</HI> For the Order, you may be pleased to understand, it is
not so absolutely Methodicall as I could wish it were, yet needs
none other <HI>Apologie,</HI> than the length of time it hath beene grow∣ing
to this Bulke, and Mortality of the <HI>Authors,</HI> who have spent (two of them
now) their lives in the disquisition of venerable <HI>Antiquity</HI> concerning this <HI>City.</HI>
The Learned know, Men are all <HI>various</HI> in their Opinions, as in their <HI>Faces</HI> you
hardly finde of a Nation two that resemble in all proportions, so in their <HI>Minds</HI> is
there as much discrepancy, and then must there needs be the same or more in their
Writings, the expresse Image of their Minds. And this is the <HI>Fate</HI> of our present
<HI>Worke,</HI> which begun Methodically, hath not beene so well prosecuted, whether out of
difference in <HI>Iudgement,</HI> or want of <HI>Information,</HI> I dispute not: Probable it may
be, the desire of inserting all things for the delight of the <HI>Reader,</HI> might breed this
want of Method, and the rather am I induc'd to incline thereto, since every dayes
Experience teaches, how unstable oftentimes and incertaine Friendship is, when she
promises Information in this kinde: Yet this, the ingenuity of a courteous <HI>Reader</HI>
will excuse, since the Benefit compensates the Wrong.</P>
<P>And to administer a salve to this sore, and prevent Distraction in the <HI>Reader,</HI>
in this last Impression have you variety of <HI>Tables,</HI> succinct and pithy, yet not ob∣scure:
In the beginning, the whole body of the <HI>Book</HI> dissected into sixtie <HI>Chapters,</HI>
whose short <HI>Contents</HI> epitomize the Substance of the <HI>Work:</HI> Then briefe <HI>Schemes</HI>
as well of all the <HI>Churches</HI> in and about <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster</HI> foure miles
compasse, as of all the <HI>Halls</HI> and <HI>Companies</HI> of this Honourable <HI>City,</HI> both Alpha∣betically
ranged with reference to their proper places. Lastly, that nothing might be
wanting which should bring ease and furtherance to the Studious <HI>Reader,</HI> have
you a <HI>Catalogue</HI> of <HI>Authors,</HI> on whose authority the truth of our Assertions may
depend.</P>
<P>Neither leave we you heare: In the end also have we furnished it with two exact
<HI>Tables;</HI> The first an <HI>Index,</HI> containing in it the chiefe <HI>Streets, Lanes, Con∣duits,</HI>
stately <HI>Houses</HI> of <HI>Noblemen, Innes</HI> of <HI>Court, Chancery,</HI> and other
ancient <HI>Monuments</HI> of this <HI>City,</HI> not without the admixion also of worthy <HI>Acti∣ons</HI>
and <HI>Customes</HI> of <HI>Citizens.</HI> The other a <HI>Concordance</HI> of those, whose
<HI>Honour</HI> in their <HI>Office, Charity</HI> in their <HI>Almes, Memory</HI> in their <HI>Monu∣ment,</HI>
<PB REF="5"/>
hath acquainted <HI>Posterity</HI> with their <HI>Names:</HI> By this Guide, hee who
boasts his Birth in a Magnificent <HI>City</HI> (as the Ancient did in <HI>Rome</HI> or <HI>Athens)</HI>
may with great facility finde his Ancestors in their <HI>Honours, Almes giving,
Tombes,</HI> or other memorable and worthy Actions here recorded: For instance
(not to exceed our Memories) finde the name of <HI>Anderson</HI> in the <HI>Concordance,</HI>
and according to the first figures <HI>(105. a. ¶)</HI> turne to the Page, and you have his
Liberality or Benefaction to <HI>Brazen-nose</HI> College in <HI>Oxford;</HI> then consult the
second <HI>(291. a. ¶)</HI> in like manner, and you have his Monument in Saint <HI>Olave
Vpwel's</HI> Church: so the third <HI>(592. b. ¶.)</HI> and you shall finde him there She∣riffe,
<HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1601. The same order is observed in the rest, onely for distin∣ction
sake, I have added these letters. <HI>B.</HI> to such as have beene <HI>Bishops,</HI> and
<HI>M.</HI> to those that have borne the Office of <HI>Maior.</HI></P>
<P>Thus have we endevored to prevent Distraction, and reduce the copious Va∣riety
of this <HI>Worke</HI> to heads, for the <HI>Readers</HI> ease; not without a great deale of
Paines, Care, and Charge: The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>udicious can give the best estimate of the Paines;
of the Care none better than he that hath reaped benefit by the reading; as for the
Charge, the proportion of the Volume speakes, especially to the skilfull in that My∣stery;
to which if you adde the length of time (now almost three yeeres) it hath lyen
under the Presse, there is none but may conceive the greatnesse thereof. Yet no
small satisfaction to all these may you afford (Gentle <HI>Reader)</HI> by your candide and
courteous acceptance, with a future encouragement (in this, or the like) to the ready
endevours of him that will study to be</P>

<HEAD>THE SURVEY
OF
LONDON:
Containing the Originall, Antiquity, Increase, Mo∣derne
Estate, and Description of that Citie.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S the <HI>Romane</HI>
Writers, to
glorify the Ci∣tie
of <HI>Rome,</HI>
drew the Ori∣ginall
thereof
from gods &amp;
demygods, by
the <HI>Trojan</HI> pro∣genie:
so <HI>Geoffrey</HI> of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> the
Welsh Historian, deduceth the founda∣tion
of this famous Citie of <HI>London,</HI> for
the greater glorie thereof, and emulati∣on
of <HI>Rome,</HI> from the very same Origi∣nall.
For he reporteth, that <HI>Brute</HI> line∣ally
descended from the demy-god <HI>Ae∣neas,</HI>
the sonne of <HI>Venus,</HI> daughter of <HI>Iu∣piter,</HI>
about the yeere of the world 2855.
and 1108. before the nativity of Christ,
builded this Citie neere unto the River
now called <HI>Thames,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Trinobantū</HI> hath the written copie. <HI>Livi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE> and named it <HI>Troy∣novant,</HI>
or <HI>Trenovant.</HI> But herein, as <HI>Li∣vie</HI>
(the most famous Historiographer
of the <HI>Romanes)</HI> writeth, <HI>Antiquity is
pardonable, and hath an especiall priviledge,
by interlacing divine matters with humane,
to make the first foundation of Cities more
honourable, more sacred, and as it were, of
greater Majestie.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>Lud</HI> (as the aforesaid <HI>Geoffrey</HI>
of <HI>Monmouth</HI> noteth) afterward, not on∣ly
repaired this Citie; but also increa∣sed
the same with faire Buildings, Tow∣ers
and Walls, and after his owne name,
called it <HI>Caire-Lud,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Caire Lud,</HI> the Citie of <HI>Lud,</HI> but <HI>Luds-towne</HI> is a <HI>Saxon</HI> word.</NOTE> as <HI>Luds</HI> Towne, and
the strong Gate which he builded in the
West part of the Citie, he likewise (for
his owne honour) named <HI>Ludgate.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Lud</HI> had issue two sonnes, <HI>An∣drogeus,</HI>
and <HI>Theomantius,</HI> or <HI>Tenanticus,</HI>
who beeing not of age to governe at
the death of their Father; their Vncle
<HI>Cassibelan</HI> tooke upon him the Crowne;
about the eighth yeere of whose reigne,
<HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> arrived in this Land, with a
great power of <HI>Romanes</HI> to conquer it.
The manner of which Conquest, I will
summarily set downe out of his owne
Commentaries, which are of farre bet∣ter
credit, than the relations of <HI>Geoffrey
Monmouth.</HI></P>
<P>The chiefe government of the <HI>Britains,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Caesars cō∣mentaries, lib. 5.</NOTE>
and ordering of the Warres, was then (by
common advice) committed to <HI>Cassibelan,</HI>
whose Signiorie was separated from the Ci∣ties
towards the Sea-coast, by the River cal∣led
<HI>Thames,</HI> about 80. miles off from the
Sea. This <HI>Cassibelan</HI> in times past, had
made continuall warre upon the Cities ad∣joyning;
but the <HI>Britains</HI> being moved with
the <HI>Romanes</HI> invasiton, had resolved in that
necessity to make him their Soveraigne and
Generall of the Warres. <HI>Caesar</HI> having know∣ledge
of their intent, marched with his Army
to the <HI>Thames,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The River of <HI>Thames</HI> to be pas∣sed afoot in <HI>Caesars</HI> time.</NOTE> into the Signory of <HI>Cassibe∣lan.</HI>
This River can be passed but onely in
one place on foot, and that very hardly.
When he came thither, he saw a great power
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
of his enemies in battaile array, on the other
side of the River. Now was the Banke stick∣ed
full of stakes, sharpned at the end; and
likewise other stakes (of the same making)
were driven into the Channell, and hidden
with the water. <HI>Caesar</HI> having understan∣ding
thereof, by his Prisoners and Runne∣awaies,
sent his Horsemen before, and com∣manded
his Footmen to follow immediately
after them. But the <HI>Romane</HI> Souldiers
went with such speed and force, having no
more than their heads onely above the water:
that the enemy being not able to withstand
the violence of the Footmen, and the men of
Armes, forsooke the banke, and tooke them
to flight. <HI>Cassibelan</HI> despairing of his good
successe, by fighting in plaine battaile, sent
away all his greater powers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The poli∣cie of <HI>Cas∣sibelan</HI> up∣on his ill successe.</NOTE> and keeping still
about foure thousand Waggoners, watched
which way the <HI>Romanes</HI> went, and drew
somewhat aside out of the way, hiding him∣selfe
in cumbersome and woody places. And
wheresoever hee knew the <HI>Romanes</HI> should
march, hee drave both Cattell and people
thence into the Woods. When the <HI>Romanes</HI>
Horsemen ranged any thing freely abroad
into the fields for forrage, or to harry the
Countrey: he sent his Waggoners by allwaies
and paths out of the woods, upon their men
of Armes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His advā∣tage a∣gainst the <HI>Romane</HI> horsemen.</NOTE> and encountred with them to their
great prejudice, through the feare whereof,
he kept them short from ranging at their
pleasure.</P>
<P>So the matter was brought to this passe,
that <HI>Caesar</HI> would not suffer his Horsemen
to stray any farnesse from his maine Battaile
of Footmen, and adventured no further to
annoy his enemies, in wasting their fields,
and burning their houses, than he could com∣passe
by the travaile of his Footmen, as they
were able to journey.</P>
<P>In the meane while,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Trinobants</HI> Citizens of <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> the <HI>Trinobants,</HI>
which was the strongest Citie, wel-neere, of
all those Countries, and out of which Citie, a
yong Gentleman called <HI>Mandubrace,</HI> upon
confidence of <HI>Caesars</HI> helpe, comming unto
him into the maine Land of <HI>Gallia,</HI> now
called <HI>France,</HI> had thereby escaped death,
which he should have suffered at <HI>Cassibe∣lans</HI>
hand, (as his Father <HI>Imanuence</HI> had
done, who had reigned in that Citie:) sent
Ambassadours to <HI>Caesar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mandu∣brace</HI> and the <HI>Trino∣bants</HI> yeeld to <HI>Caesar,</HI> and he de∣fended them.</NOTE> promising to yeeld
unto him, and to doe what hee should com∣mand
them. Instantly desiring him, to pro∣tect
<HI>Mandubrace</HI> from the furious Tyranny
of <HI>Cassibelan,</HI> and to send him into the City,
with authority to take the government there∣of
upon him. <HI>Caesar</HI> accepted the offer, and
appointed them to give unto him 40. Hosta∣ges,
and withall to finde him graine for his
Armie, and so sent hee <HI>Mandubrace</HI> unto
them.</P>
<P>When others saw that <HI>Caesar</HI> had not only
defended the <HI>Trinobants</HI> against <HI>Cassibe∣lan,</HI>
but had also saved them harmlesse from
the pillage of his owne Souldiers: then
also did the <HI>Cenimagues, Segontians,
Aucalits, Bibrokes,</HI> and <HI>Cassians</HI> like∣wise
submit themselves unto him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cassibelans</HI> Towne west from <HI>London,</HI> for <HI>Caesar</HI> saith, 80. miles from the Sea.</NOTE> and by
them he learned, that not farre from thence
was <HI>Cassibelans</HI> Towne, (fortified with
woods and marish grounds) into the which
he had gathered a great number both of men
and cattell.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Brittans</HI> call that a Towne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cities of the <HI>Britains</HI> were cum∣bersome woods for∣tified.</NOTE> when
they have fortified a cumbersome wood with
a ditch and Rampire, and thither they resort
to eschew the invasions of their enemies. To
this place therefore marched <HI>Caesar</HI> with his
Legions; hee found it excellently fortified,
both of nature, and by mans advice: never∣thelesse,
he resolved to assault it in two seve∣rall
places at once; whereupon the <HI>Britaines</HI>
being not able to endure the force of the <HI>Ro∣manes,</HI>
fled out at another part, and left
the Towne unto him: a great number of cat∣tell
he found there, and many of the <HI>Bri∣taines</HI>
he slew, and others hee tooke in the
chase.</P>
<P>Whilest these things were a doing in these
quarters, <HI>Cassibelan</HI> sent messengers into
<HI>Kent,</HI> which lyeth upon the Sea, and in which
there reigned then foure particular <HI>Kings,</HI>
named, <HI>Cingetorix, Carvil, Taximagul,</HI>
and <HI>Segonax,</HI> whom he commanded to raise
all their forces, and suddenly to set upon,
and assault the <HI>Romanes</HI> in their Trenches
by the Sea side: the which when the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI>
perceived, they sallied out upon them,
slew a great sort of them, and taking <HI>Cin∣getorix</HI>
their noble Captaine prisoner, reti∣red
themselves to their Campe in good safe∣tie.</P>
<P>When <HI>Cassibelan</HI> heard of this, and had
formerly taken many other losses, and found
his Countrey sore wasted, and himselfe left
almost alone, by the defection of the other Ci∣ties,
he sent Ambassadours by <HI>Comius</HI> of
<HI>Arras</HI> to <HI>Caesar,</HI> to intreat him concerning
his owne submission: the which <HI>Caesar</HI> did
accept; and taking Hostages, assessed the
Realme of <HI>Britaine</HI> to a yeerely Tribute,
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
to be paid to the people of <HI>Rome,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Britaine</HI> ses∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to pay a yeerely tribute to <HI>Rome.</HI></NOTE> giving
straight charge to <HI>Cassibelan,</HI> that he should
not seeke any revenge upon <HI>Mandubrace,</HI>
or the <HI>Trinobants,</HI> and so withdrew his Ar∣mie
to the Sea againe.</P>
<P>Thus farre out of <HI>Caesars</HI> Commenta∣ries,
concerning this History, which
hapned in the yeere before Christs nati∣vity,
54. In all which processe, there is
for this purpose to be noted, that <HI>Caesar</HI>
nameth the Citie of <HI>Trinobantes,</HI> which
hath a resemblance with <HI>Troy nova,</HI> or
<HI>Trinobantum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trinobant, <HI>new</HI> Londō.</NOTE> having no greater diffe∣rence
in the Orthography, than changing
<HI>(b)</HI> into <HI>(v),</HI> and yet maketh an errour,
whereof I will not argue. Onely this I
will note, that divers learned men doe
not thinke <HI>Civitas Trinobantum,</HI> to bee
well and truely translated, the Citie of
the <HI>Trinobantes:</HI> but it should rather bee
the state, communalty, or Signiorie of
the <HI>Trinobantes,</HI> for that <HI>Caesar</HI> in his
Commentaries useth the word <HI>Civitas,</HI>
onely for a people living under the selfe∣same
Prince and Law. But certaine it
is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cities of the <HI>Britains</HI> not artifi∣cially buil∣ded with houses, nor walled with stone</NOTE> that the Cities of the <HI>Brittaines</HI> were
(in those daies) neither artificially buil∣ded
with houses, nor strongly walled
with stone, but were onely thicke and
cumbersome Woods, plashed within,
and trenched about: and the like (in ef∣fect)
doe other the Romane and Greeke
Authors affirme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strabo.</NOTE> as <HI>Strabo, Pomponius
Mela,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pomponius Mela.</NOTE> and <HI>Dion,</HI> a Senator of <HI>Rome,</HI> which
flourished in the severall reignes of the
Romane Emperours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tacitus.</NOTE> <HI>Tiberius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dion.</NOTE> <HI>Claudius,
Domitian,</HI> and <HI>Severus:</HI> to wit, that be∣fore
the arrivall of the <HI>Romanes,</HI> the <HI>Brit∣taines</HI>
had no Townes, but called that a
Towne, which had a thicke intangled
Wood, defended (as I said) with a ditch
and banke, the like whereof the <HI>Irishmen,</HI>
our next neighbours, doe at this day call
<HI>Fastnes.</HI> But after that these hither parts
of <HI>Britains</HI> were reduced into the forme
of a Province, by the <HI>Romans,</HI> who sowed
the seeds of civility over all <HI>Europe;</HI> this
Citie, whatsoever it was before, began
to be renowned and of fame.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>London</HI> most fa∣mous for merchants and enter∣course.</NOTE> For <HI>Taci∣tus,</HI>
who first of all Authors nameth it
<HI>Londinium,</HI> saith, that in the 26. yeere
after Christ, it was, albeit no Colonie
of the <HI>Romanes,</HI> yet most famous for the
great multitude of Merchants, provisi∣on,
and entercourse. At which time, in
that notable revolt of the <HI>Britaines</HI> from
<HI>Nero,</HI> in which threescore and ten thou∣sand
<HI>Romanes</HI> and their confederates
were slaine; this Citie, with <HI>Verulami∣um,</HI>
neere Saint <HI>Albans,</HI> and <HI>Maldon</HI> in
<HI>Essex,</HI> then all famous, were ransacked
and spoiled. For <HI>Suetonius Paulinus,</HI> then
Lieutenant for the <HI>Romanes</HI> in this Ile,
abandoned it, as not then fortified, and
left it to the spoile.</P>
<P>Shortly after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Bri∣taines</HI> had no houses, but cotta∣ges.</NOTE> <HI>Iulius Agricola,</HI> the <HI>Ro∣mane</HI>
Lieutenant, in the time of <HI>Domiti∣an,</HI>
was the first that (by adhorting the
<HI>Britaines</HI> publikely, and helping them
privately) wonne them to build houses,
for themselves, Temples for the gods,
and Courts for Justice, to bring up the
Noble mens children in good Letters,
and humanity, and to apparell them∣selves
<HI>Romane</HI> like.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Bri∣taines</HI> wen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> naked, their bo∣dies pain∣ted.</NOTE> Whereas before (for
the most part) they went naked, pain∣ting
their bodies, &amp;c. as all the <HI>Romane</HI>
Writers have observed.</P>
<P>True it is, I confesse, that afterward
many Cities and Townes in <HI>Britaine,</HI>
under the Government of the <HI>Romanes,</HI>
were walled with Stone, and baked
Brickes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Richborrow <HI>in</HI> Kent.</NOTE> or Tyles; as <HI>Richborrow, Rypta∣chester,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Verulamiū.</NOTE> in the Ile of <HI>Thanet,</HI> till the chan∣nell
altered his course;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cilcester.</NOTE> besides <HI>Sand∣wich</HI>

<HI>Rible; Aldeburge,</HI> a mile from <HI>Borrow∣bridge,</HI>
or <HI>Wathelingstreet,</HI> on <HI>Vre</HI> River,
and others.</P>
<P>And no doubt but this Citie of <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
was also walled with Stone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the wal about <HI>Lon∣don.</HI></NOTE> in the
time of the <HI>Romane</HI> Government here,
but yet very lately. For, it seemeth
not to have beene walled in the yeere of
our Lord 296. because in that yeere,
when <HI>Alectus</HI> the Tyrant was slaine in
the Field, the <HI>Franks</HI> or <HI>Franconians</HI> ea∣sily
entred <HI>London,</HI> and had sacked the
same, had not GOD (of his great
favour) at the very instant, brought
along the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> certaine
Bands of Romane Souldiers, who
slew those <HI>Franks</HI> in every street of the

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N few yeeres after, as <HI>Si∣meon

Writer, reporteth,
<HI>Helen,</HI> the Mother of
<HI>Constatine</HI> the great,
was the first that in∣walled
this Citie, about the yeere of
Christ, 306. But howsoever those wals
of stone might be builded by <HI>Helen,</HI> yet
the <HI>Britaines</HI> (I know) had no skill of
building with stone, as it may appeare
by that which followeth, about the
yeere of Christ, 399. when <HI>Arcadius</HI>
and <HI>Honorius,</HI> the sonnes of <HI>Theodosius
Magnus,</HI> governed the Empire, the
one in the East, the other in the West.
For <HI>Honorius</HI> having received <HI>Britaine,</HI>
the Citie of <HI>Rome</HI> was invaded and de∣stroyed
by the <HI>Gothes;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Ro∣manes</HI> left to govern in <HI>Britaine.</HI></NOTE> after which time
the <HI>Romanes</HI> left to rule in <HI>Britaine,</HI> as be∣ing
imployed in defence of their Ter∣ritories
neerer home. Whereupon the
<HI>Britaines,</HI> not able to defend themselves
against the invasions of their enemies,
were many yeeres together under the
oppression of two cruell Nations, the
<HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Picts,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Picts</HI> invade this Land.</NOTE> and at length were for∣ced
to send their Ambassadours, with
Letters and lamentable supplications to
<HI>Rome,</HI> requiring aide and succour from
thence, upon promise of their continuall
fealtie, so that the <HI>Romanes</HI> would rescue
them out of the hands of their enemies.
Hereupon, the <HI>Romanes</HI> sent unto them
a Legion of armed Souldiers, which
comming into this Iland, and encoun∣tring
with the enemies, overthrew a
great number of them, and drave the
rest out of the frontiers of the Country.
And so setting the <HI>Britaines</HI> at liberty,
counselled them to make a Wall, ex∣tending
all along between the two seas,
which might be of force to keepe out
their evill neighbours, and then retur∣ned
home with great triumph. The
<HI>Britaines</HI> wanting Masons, builded that
wall,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Britaines</HI> unskilfull of buil∣ding with stone.</NOTE> not of stone (as they were advised)
but made it of turfe, and that so slender,
that it served little or nothing at all for
their defence. And the enemy percei∣ving
that the <HI>Romane</HI> Legion was retur∣ned
home, forthwith arrived out of
their Boats, invaded their borders, over∣came
the Countrey, and (as it were)
bare downe all that was before them.</P>
<P>Whereupon, Ambassadours were
eftsoones dispatched to <HI>Rome,</HI> lamenta∣bly
beseeching, that they would not suf∣fer
their miserable Countrey to bee ut∣terly
destroyed. Then againe, another
Legion was sent, which comming on a
sudden, made a great slaughter of the
enemy, and chased him home, even to
his owne Countrey. These <HI>Romanes</HI> at
their departure told the <HI>Britaines</HI> plain∣ly,
that it was not for their ease or lea∣sure,
to take upon them (any more) such
long and laborious journies for their de∣fence,
and therefore bade them practise
the use of Armour and Weapons, and
learn to withstand their enemies, whom
nothing else did make so strong, as their
faint heart and cowardise. And for so
much as they thought, that it would be
no small helpe and encouragement unto
their tributarie friends, whom they
were now forced to forsake: they buil∣ded
for them a wall of hard stone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Witchendus.</NOTE> from
the West Sea to the East Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wall of stone buil∣ded by the <HI>Romanes,</HI> betwixt the <HI>Britains</HI> and <HI>Scots.</HI></NOTE> right be∣tweene
those two Cities, which were
there made to keepe out the enemies, in
the selfe-same place where <HI>Severus</HI> be∣fore
had cast his Trench: the <HI>Britaines</HI>
also putting to their helping hands as
labourers.</P>
<P>This Wall they builded eight foot
thicke in bredth, and twelve foot in
height, right as it were by a line from
East to West; as the ruines thereof,
(remaining in many places till this day)
doe make to appeare. Which worke
thus perfected, they gave the people
straight charge to looke well to them∣selves,
they teach them to handle their
weapons, and instruct them in warlike
feats. And lest by the Sea side South∣wards,
where their Ships lay at harbor,
the enemie should come on Land; they
made up sundry bulwarkes, each some∣what
distant from other, &amp; so bid them
farewell, as minding no more to return.
This hapned in the dayes of <HI>Theodosius</HI>
the yonger, almost 500. yeeres after the
first arrivall of the <HI>Romanes</HI> here, about
the yeere after Christs Incarnation,
434.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="10"/>
The <HI>Britaines</HI> after this continuing a
lingring and doubtfull warre with the
<HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Picts;</HI> made choice of <HI>Vortiger</HI>
to be their King and Leader: which man
(as saith <HI>Malmesbury)</HI> was neither valo∣rous

death of their friends, nor feare of their
owne danger, could cure the mortality
of their soules; wherupon a great stroke
of vengeance ensued upon the whole
sinfull Nation. For, being now againe
infested with their old neighbours, the
<HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Picts,</HI> they consult with their
King <HI>Vortiger,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Witchendus.</NOTE> and send for the <HI>Saxons,</HI>
who shortly after arrived here in <HI>Bri∣taine;</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bede.</NOTE> where,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Saxons</HI> Sent for to defend the <HI>Britaines,</HI> but they drave thē into the Moun∣taines.</NOTE> saith <HI>Bede,</HI> they were re∣ceived
as friends: but as it proved, they
minded to destroy the Countrey as ene∣mies.
For after they had driven out the
<HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>Picts,</HI> they also drave the <HI>Bri∣taines,</HI>
some over the Seas, some into the
waste mountaines of <HI>Wales</HI> and <HI>Cornwall,</HI>
and divided the Countrey into divers
Kingdomes amongst themselves.</P>
<P>These <HI>Saxons</HI> were likewise ignorant
of building with stone,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Saxons</HI> un∣skilfull of building with stone.</NOTE> untill the yeere
680. for then it is affirmed, that <HI>Bennet,</HI>
Abbot of <HI>Wirrall,</HI> Master to the reve∣rend
<HI>Bede,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bennet,</HI> a Monke, brought in Masons.</NOTE> first brought Artificers of
stone houses, and glasse windowes into
this Iland, amongst the <HI>Saxons:</HI> Arts,
before that time, unto them unknowne,
and therefore used they but woodden
buildings. And to this accordeth <HI>Poly∣chronicon,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Woodden churches, and goldē priests.</NOTE> who saith, that then had yee
woodden Churches; nay woodden Cha∣lices,
and golden Priests; but since, gol∣den
Chalices, and woodden Priests.
And, to knit up this Argument, King
<HI>Edgar,</HI> in his Charter to the Abbey of
<HI>Malmesbury,</HI> dated the yeere of Christ
974. hath words to this effect: <HI>All the
Monasteries in my Realme,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monaste∣ries of rot∣ten timber</NOTE> <HI>to the outward
sight, are nothing but worm-eaten and rotten
Timber, and boords; and that worse is,
within they are almost empty and void of di∣vine
Service.</HI></P>
<P>Thus much be said for walling, not
onely in respect of this Citie, but gene∣rally
also of the first within the Realme.
Now to returne to our <HI>Trinobant,</HI> (as
<HI>Caesar</HI> cals it;) the same is (since) by
<HI>Tacitus, Ptolomaeus,</HI> and <HI>Antonius,</HI> called
<HI>Londinium, Longidinium;</HI> of <HI>Ammianus,
Lundinum,</HI> and <HI>Augusta,</HI> who calleth it
also an ancient Citie. Of our <HI>Britaines,
Lundaine;</HI> of the old <HI>Saxons, Lunden∣ceaster,
Lundenbirig, Londennir.</HI> Of stran∣gers,
<HI>Londra</HI> and <HI>Londres;</HI> of the inha∣bitants,
<HI>London:</HI> whereof you may read
a more large and learned Discourse, and
how it tooke the name, in that Worke
of my loving friend, Master <HI>Camden,</HI>

<P>Concerning M<SUP>r.</SUP> <HI>Camden,</HI> in his more
absolute relation of <HI>London,</HI> the Argu∣ment
we have now in hand; I will be so
bold as to borrow his owne words, as he
hath set them downe in his <HI>Britania.</HI>
Summing over the severall names then
given and attributed thereto, as former∣ly
hath beene declared: hee comes to
his owne iudgement:</P>
<P>For mine owne part,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Camden</HI> in his <HI>Britan∣nia</HI> concer∣ning the name of <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> <HI>(saith hee)</HI> seeing
that <HI>Caesar</HI> and <HI>Strabo</HI> doe write, that the
ancient <HI>Britaines</HI> called those Woods and
Groves, by the name of Cities and Townes,
which they had fenced with Trees, cast down
and plashed, to stop up all passage: Seeing
also I have understood, that such Woods or
Groves are in the British Tongue named
<HI>Llhwn:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of <HI>British</HI> Townes and Cities</NOTE> I incline a little to the opinion,
that <HI>London</HI> thence tooke name, as one

or A Citie thicke of Trees. But if herein I
faile of the truth; let me (with good leave)
give my conjecture. And here would I have
no man to charge me with inconstancie, while
I disport in conjecture; that whence it had
the fame,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>London</HI> re∣ceived nama frō Ships and shipping.</NOTE> thence also it took name, even from

<P>But of these, none hath better right to as∣sume
unto it the name of a Ship-Roade, or

of both Elements, most happy and blessed it
is;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The situ∣ation of <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> as being situated in a rich and fertile
soile, abounding with plentifull store of all
things, and on the gentle ascent and rising of
an Hill, hard by the <HI>Thames</HI> side, the most
milde Merchant (as one would say) of all
things that the world doth yeeld: which
swelling at certaine houres with the Ocean
Tides, by his safe and deepe Channell (able

bringeth in so great riches from all parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The bene∣fit of the <HI>Thames</HI> eb¦bing and flowing, &amp; also of the shipping.</NOTE>
that it striveth at this day with the Mart-Townes

Road for Shipping. A man would say
that seeth the Shipping there, that it is (as
it were) a very Wood of Trees, disbranched
to make glades and let in light: So shaded
it is with Masts and Sayles.</P>
<P>Who was the first Founder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Concer∣ning the first foun∣der of <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> is by length
of time growne out of knowledge: and in∣truth,
very few Cities there are, that know
theier owne first Founders, considering they
grew up to their greatnesse by little and lit∣tle.
But as other Cities, so this of ours, fa∣thereth
her originall upon the <HI>Trojans,</HI> as
verily beleeving that <HI>Brute</HI> (the Nephew in
the third descent of great <HI>Aeneas)</HI> was the
builder thereof.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Brute</HI> sup∣posed to bee the builder.</NOTE> But whosoever founded it;
the happy and fortunate estate thereof hath
given good proofe, that built it was in a good
houre, and marked for life and long conti∣nuance.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Antiquity of <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> And that it is for Antiquity Ho∣nourable,
<HI>Ammianus Marcellinus</HI> giveth
us to understand; who called it in his time,
(and that was 1200. yeeres agoe) <HI>An old
Towne.</HI> And <HI>Cornelius Tacitus</HI> in like
manner, who in <HI>Nero's</HI> dayes, 1540. yeeres
since, reported it to have bin a place <HI>Very fa∣mous
for fresh trade, concourse of Mer∣chants,
&amp; great store of victuals, and all
things necessary.</HI> This onely at that time
was wanting to the glory thereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>London</HI> no free Citie, nor Colonie in the <HI>Romanes</HI> time.</NOTE> that it had
the name neither of a free City, nor of a <HI>Co∣lony.</HI>
Neither verily could it have stood with
the <HI>Romanes</HI> profit, if a Citie flourishing
with Merchandize, should haue enjoyed the
right of a Colonie or Free Citie. And there∣fore
it was (as I suppose) that they ordained
it to be a <HI>Praefectura:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>London</HI> a <HI>Praefectura,</HI> governed by Officers yeerely sent to it from <HI>Rome.</HI></NOTE> for so they termed
all Townes where Marts were kept, and Iu∣stice
ministred: Yet so, as that they had no
Magistrates of their owne: but Rulers were
sent every yeere to governe in them, and for
to minister Law, which in publike matters,
namely of Taxe, Tributes, Tolles, Customes,
Warfare, &amp;c. they should have from the Se∣nate
of <HI>Rome.</HI> Hence it commeth that <HI>Ta∣citus,</HI>
the <HI>Panegyrist,</HI> and <HI>Marcellinus</HI>
call it onely a Towne.</P>
<P>And although it was not in name loftier;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>London</HI> flourished equall with any other place.</NOTE>
yet in wealth, riches and prosperity, it flou∣rished
as much as any other: yea and conti∣nued
in manner alwaies the same, under the
dominion of <HI>Romanes, English-Saxons,</HI>
and <HI>Normans,</HI> seldome or never afflicted
with any great calamities. In the reigne of
<HI>Nero,</HI> when the <HI>Britaines</HI> had conspired to
recover and resume their liberty under the
leading of <HI>Boadicia;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Suetonius Paulinus,</HI> Lieute∣nant for <HI>Rome.</HI></NOTE> the <HI>Londoners</HI> could
not with all their weeping teares, hold <HI>Sue∣tonius
Paulinus,</HI> but that after he had le∣vied
a power of the Citizens to aide him, he
would needes dislodge and remove from
thence, leaving the Citie naked to the enemy;
who forthwith surprized and slew some few,
whom either weaknesse of sexe, feeblenesse of
age, or sweetnesse of the place had detained
there.</P>
<P>This City of <HI>Londō</HI> having bin destroy∣ed

<P>And that this Citie was then strong∣ly

<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Malmes∣bury.</NOTE> whereof <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Malmesbury</HI>
hath,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Assur.</NOTE> that about the yeere of Christ, 994

<P>In the yeere 1016. <HI>Edmund Ironside,</HI>
reigning over the <HI>West-Saxons, Canutus</HI>
the <HI>Dane,</HI> bringing his Navy unto the

about the Citie of <HI>London,</HI> and then at∣tempted
to have won it by assault: but
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
the Citizens repulsed him, and drave
them from their Wals.</P>
<P>Also in the yeere 1052. Earle <HI>Godwin,</HI>
with his Navie sayled up by the South
end of the Bridge, and so assailed the
Walles of this Citie.</P>
<P>William Fitzstephen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Fitzste∣phen.</NOTE> <HI>in the reigne of</HI>
Henry <HI>the second, writing of the Wals
of this Citie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Citie of <HI>London</HI> walled round a∣bout by the River of <HI>Thames.</HI></NOTE> <HI>hath these words:</HI> the wall
is high and great, well towred on the North
side, with due distance betweene the Towres.
On the South side also, the Citie was walled
and towred: but the fishfull River of
<HI>Thames,</HI> by his ebbing and flowing, hath
long since subverted them.</P>
<P>By the North side, he meaneth from
the River of <HI>Thames</HI> in the East, to the
River of <HI>Thames</HI> in the West: for so
stretched the Wall in his time, and the
Citie being farre more in length from
East to West, than in breadth from
South to North; and also narrower at
both ends, than in the middest, is there∣fore
compassed with the Wall on the
Land side, in forme of a bow, except
denting in betwixt <HI>Cripplegate</HI> and <HI>Al∣dersgate.</HI>
But the Wall on the South
side, along by the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> was
straight, as the string of a bow, and all
furnished with Towres or Bulwarkes,
(as we now terme them) in due distance
every one from other, as witnesseth our
Author, and our selves may behold for
the Land side. This may suffice for
proofe of a Wall, and forme thereof a∣bout
this Citie, and the same to have
beene of great Antiquity, as any other
within this Realme.</P>
<P>And now touching the maintenance
and repairing the said Wall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wals of <HI>London</HI> re∣paired.</NOTE> I read, that
in the yeere 1215. the 6. of King <HI>Iohn,</HI>
the Barons entring the City by <HI>Ealdgate,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Roger <HI>of</HI> Randover.</NOTE>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. Paris.</NOTE> with great diligence repaired the
wals and gates of the Citie, with stones
taken from the <HI>Iewes</HI> broken houses. In
the yeere 1257. <HI>Henry</HI> the third caused
the wals of this Citie, which were sore
decayed, and destitute of Towres and
Towrets, to be repaired in more seeme∣ly
wise than before, at the common char∣ges
of the Citie. Also, in the yeere 1282
King <HI>Edward</HI> the first, having granted
to <HI>Robert Kilwarby,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Can∣terbury,</HI>
licence for the enlarging of the
<HI>Blacke Friers</HI> Church, to breake and take
downe a part of the Wall of the Citie,
from <HI>Ludgate</HI> to the River of <HI>Thames:</HI> He
also granted to <HI>Henry Waleis,</HI> Maior, and
the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> the favour to
take toward the making of the wall, and
inclosure of the Citie, certaine customs,
or toll, as appeareth by his Grant. This
wall was then to be made from <HI>Ludgate</HI>
west to <HI>Fleetbridge,</HI> along behinde the
houses, and along by the water of the
<HI>Fleet</HI> unto the River of <HI>Thames.</HI> More∣over,
in the yeere 1310. <HI>Edward</HI> the se∣cond
commanded the Citizens to make
up the Wall already begunne, and the
Tower at the end of the same Wall,
within the water of <HI>Thames,</HI> neere unto
the <HI>Blacke Friers,</HI> &amp;c. 1322. the second
of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, the Wals of this
Citie were repaired.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Patent.</NOTE> It was also granted
by King <HI>Richard</HI> the second, in the tenth
yeere of his reigne, that a toll should be
taken of the wares, sold by Land or by
Water, (for tenne yeeres) towards the
repairing of the Wals, and cleansing of
the Ditch about <HI>London.</HI> In the 17. of
<HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, <HI>Ralph Ioseline</HI> Maior,
caused part of the Wall about the Citie
of <HI>London</HI> to be repaired; to wit, betwixt
<HI>Ealdgate</HI> and <HI>Aldersgate.</HI> He also caused
the <HI>Moore-field</HI> to be searched for clay,
and bricke thereof to be made and burnt:
he likewise caused chalke to be brought
out of <HI>Kent,</HI> and to be burnt into lime in
the same <HI>Moore-field,</HI> for more furthe∣rance
of the worke. Then the Skinners,
to beginne in the East, made that part
of the Wall, betwixt <HI>Ealdgate</HI> and <HI>Buries
markes,</HI> towards <HI>Bishopsgate;</HI> as may ap∣peare
by their Armes in three places
fixed there. The Maior, with his Com∣panie

<HI>Bishopsgate</HI> and <HI>Alhallowes</HI> Church
in the same Wall, and from <HI>Alhallowes</HI>
towards the <HI>Posterne</HI> called <HI>Mooregate.</HI>
A great part of the same Wall was re∣paired
by the Executors of Sir <HI>Iohn Cros∣by,</HI>
late Alderman, as may appeare by

And other Companies repaired the
rest of the VVall to the <HI>Posterne</HI> of <HI>Crip∣plegate.</HI></P>
<P>In a Record which I have seene, and

written: In <HI>Anno</HI> 1477. by the diligence

He caused chalke also to be brought out
of <HI>Kent,</HI> and in the same <HI>Moore-fields</HI> to
be burnt into lime, onely for the furthe∣rance

builded, of the goods, and by the Exe∣cutours
of Sir <HI>Iohn Crosby,</HI> sometimes
an Alderman, and Maior of <HI>London,</HI> as
may appeare by his Armes thereon fi∣xed

a great worke to be done in one yeere.</P>
<P>The Goldsmiths repaired from <HI>Cre∣plegate</HI>
towards <HI>Aldersgate,</HI> and there the

<HI>London</HI> under <HI>Oldborne-bridge,</HI> and
<HI>Fleet-bridge</HI> into the <HI>Thames,</HI> had beene
of such bredth and depth, that ten or twelve
Ships,<NOTE PLACE="marg">River of <HI>Wels</HI> bare Ships.</NOTE> Navies at once with Merchandises,
were wont to come to the foresaid Bridge of
<HI>Fleet,</HI> and some of them unto <HI>Oldborne-bridge:</HI>
Now the same course (by filth of
the Tanners, and such others) was sore
decayed; also by raising of Wharfes, but e∣specially,
by a diversion of the water, made
by theni of the <HI>New Temple,</HI> for their
Milles standing without <HI>Baynards Ca∣stle,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Patent Record.</NOTE> in the first yeere of King <HI>Iohn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Milles by <HI>Baynards Castle,</HI> made in the first of K. <HI>Iohn.</HI></NOTE> and by
divers others impediments, so as the said
Ships could not enter as they were wont,
and as they ought. Wherefore hee desired,
that the Maior of <HI>London,</HI> with the Shi∣riffes,
and other discreet Aldermen, might
be appointed to view the said course of the
said water, and that by the oathes of good
men, all the foresaid hindrances might bee
removed, and it to be made as it was wont
of old. Whereupon <HI>Roger le Barbason,</HI>
the Constable of the Tower, with the Maior
and Shiriffes, were assigned to take with
them honest and discreet men, and to make
diligent search and enquirie, how the said
River was in former time, and that they
leave nothing that may hurt or stoppe it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">River so called in the yeere 1307.</NOTE>
but keepe it in the same estate that it was
wont to be. <HI>So farre the Record.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon it followed, that the
said River was at that time cleansed,
these Milles removed, and other things
done for the preservation of the course
therof: notwithstanding never brought
to the old depth and bredth: wherupon
the name of River ceased, and it was
since called a Brooke; namely, <HI>Turne∣mill</HI>
or <HI>Tremill</HI> Brooke,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Turnemill</HI> Brooke.</NOTE> for that divers
Milles were erected upon it, as appea∣reth
by a faire Register Booke, contai∣ning
the foundation of the Priorie at
<HI>Clarken-well,</HI> and donation of the lands
thereunto belonging, as also by divers
other Records.</P>
<P>This Brooke hath beene divers times
since cleansed, namely, and last of
all to any effect, in the yeere one thou∣sand
five hundred and two, the seven∣teenth
of <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, the whole
course of <HI>Fleet-Dike,</HI> then so called,
was scowred (I say) downe unto the
<HI>Thames,</HI> so that Boats with Fish and
Fewell were rowed to <HI>Fleet-bridge</HI> and
<HI>Oldborne-bridge,</HI> as they of old time
had beene accustomed, which was a
great commodity to all the inhabitants
in that part of the Citie.</P>
<P>In the yeere 1589. was granted a fif∣teen
by a common Councel of the City,
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
for the clensing of this Brooke or Dike:
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fleet-Dike</HI> promised to be clen∣sed, the mony col∣lected, and the Citi∣zens de∣ceived.</NOTE> the money amounting to a thousand
marks, was collected, and it was under∣taken,
that by drawing divers Springs
about <HI>Hampsted</HI> Heath into one head
and course, both the Citie should bee
served of fresh water in all places of
want, and also, that by such a follower,
(as men call it) the channell of this
Brooke should be scowred into the Ri∣ver
of <HI>Thames.</HI> But much money being
therein spent, the effect failed; so that
the Brooke, by meanes of continuall in∣crochments
upon the banks, getting o∣ver
the water, and casting of soylage in∣to
the streame, is now become worse
cloyed than ever it was before.</P>
<P>The running water, so called by <HI>Willi∣am
Conqueror</HI> in his said Charter, which
entreth the Citie, &amp;c. (before there
was any ditch) betweene <HI>Bishopsgate</HI> and
the late-made <HI>Posterne</HI> called <HI>Mooregate,</HI>
entred the wall, and was truely of the
wall called <HI>Walbrooke,</HI> not of <HI>Gualo,</HI> as
some have farre fetched. It ran through
the Citie, with divers windings from
the North towards the South, into the
River of <HI>Thames;</HI> and had (over the
same) divers Bridges along the streets
and lanes through which it passed. I
have read in an old Booke, long since
printed, that the Prior of holy Trinity
within <HI>Ealdgate,</HI> ought to make over
<HI>Walbrooke</HI> in the VVard of <HI>Broadstreet,</HI> a∣gainst
the stone wall of the Citie, <HI>viz.</HI>
the same bridge that is next the Church
of <HI>All Saints</HI> at the VVall. Also, that
the Prior of the New Hospitall, S. <HI>Mary
Spittle,</HI> without <HI>Bishopsgate,</HI> ought to
make the middle part of one other
Bridge next to the said Bridge towards
the North: and that in the 28. yeere
of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, it was by Inquisition
found before the Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> that
the Parish of S. <HI>Stephen</HI> upon <HI>Walbrooke,</HI>
ought of right to scowre the course of
the said Brooke; and therefore the Shi∣riffes
were commanded to distraine the
said Parishioners so to do. In the yeere
1300. the keepers of those bridges at
that time, were <HI>William Iordan,</HI> and <HI>Iohn
de Bever.</HI> This water-course having di∣vers
Bridges, was afterwards vaulted
over with Bricke,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Walbrooke</HI> vaulted and paved over.</NOTE> and paved levell with
the streets and lanes, where-through it
passed; and since that also, houses have
been builded thereon, so that the course
of <HI>Walbrooke</HI> is now hid under ground,
and thereby hardly knowne.</P>
<P><HI>Langborne</HI> water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Langborne.</NOTE> so called of the
length thereof, was a great streame
breaking out of the ground in <HI>Fen Church</HI>
street, which ranne downe with a swift
course, west, through the street, thwart
<HI>Grastreet,</HI> and downe <HI>Lumbard street,</HI> to
the west end of Saint <HI>Mary Wolnoths</HI>
Church, and then turning the course
South,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Shareborne</HI> Lane.</NOTE> downe <HI>Shareborne</HI> Lane (so ter∣med
of sharing or dividing) it brake in∣to
divers rilles or rillets to the River of

tooke the name, and is to this day called
<HI>Langborne</HI> VVard.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Langborne</HI> Ward.</NOTE> This Boorne is also
long since stopped up at the head, and
the rest of the course filled up, and pa∣ved
over, so that no signe thereof re∣maineth,
more than the names afore∣said.</P>
<P><HI>Oldborne</HI> or <HI>Hilborne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oldborne.</NOTE> was the like wa∣ter,
breaking out about the place where
now the Barres doe stand, and it ranne
downe the whole street to <HI>Oldborne
bridge,</HI> and into the River of the <HI>Wels,</HI> or
<HI>Turne-mill brooke.</HI> This Boorne was like∣wise
(long since) stopped up at the
head, and in other places, where the
same hath broken out: but yet till this
day, the said street is there called, high
<HI>Oldborne</HI> hill, and both the sides there∣of,
(together with all the grounds ad∣joyning,
that lye betwixt it and the Ri∣ver
of <HI>Thames)</HI> remaine full of Springs,
so that water is there found at hand, and
hard to be stopped in every house.</P>
<P>There are <HI>(saith</HI> Fitzstephen) neere <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>

<P>The first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Holy Well,</NOTE> to wit, <HI>Holy Well,</HI> is much

of the Parish Clarkes in <HI>London,</HI> who (of
old time) were accustomed there yeere∣ly
to assemble, and to play some large
Historie of holy Scripture. For exam∣ple,
of later time, to wit, in the yeere
1390. the 14. of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, I
read,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Playes by the Parish Clarks at <HI>Clarks Well.</HI></NOTE> that the Parish Clarkes of <HI>London,</HI>
on the 18. of <HI>Iuly,</HI> plaid Enterludes at

<P>Then was there <HI>Fags well,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fags well.</NOTE> neere unto

up, that their places are hardly now

<P>Somewhat North from <HI>Holy well,</HI> is
one other Well, curbed square with
stone, and is called <HI>Dame Annis the cleere;</HI>
and not farre from it, but somewhat
west, is also another cleere water, called
<HI>Perilous Pond,</HI> because divers Youths (by
swimming therein) have beene drow∣ned.
And thus much be said for Foun∣taines
and Wels.</P>
<P><HI>Horsepoole</HI> in <HI>West smithfield,</HI> was some∣time
a great water; and because the in∣habitants
in that part of the Citie did
there water their Horses, the same was
in old Records called <HI>Horsepoole.</HI> It is
now much decayed, the Springs being
stopped up, and the Land-water fal∣ling
into the small bottome, remaining
inclosed with Bricke, is called <HI>Smith-field</HI>
Pond.</P>
<P>By S. <HI>Giles</HI> Churchyard was a large
water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Poole without <HI>Creplegate.</HI></NOTE> called a Poole: I reade in the

<P>The said River of <HI>Wels,</HI> the running

and other the fresh waters that
were in and about this Citie, being in
processe of time, by incroachment for

utterly decayed, and the number of Ci∣tizens
mightily increased; they were
forced to seeke fresh waters abroad;
whereof some, at the request of King

<HEAD>Of the Ancient and famous River of Thames, whence
it deriveth her head or originall, and so conveyeth it selfe on to
the Cities service, being supplyed by divers
other sweet Rivers in her course,</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>OV have already heard,
what Rivers, Brookes,
Boornes, Pooles and Con∣duits
of fresh water have
liberally afforded (out of
their plenty) most commodious helpe
for the service of so great a Citie. And
yet the River of <HI>Thames,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The River of <HI>Thames</HI> a chife honour to the whole Land, and especially to the Ci∣tie of <HI>Lon∣don.</HI></NOTE> much more fa∣mous
than all the reft, yeelding by For∣niers,

her due worth, neither of her antiqui∣ty,
course and originall, all which de∣serve
to be more especially respected.
According therefore to the advice of
very wise and learned judgements, and
borrowing such helps as they have glad∣ly
lent me, I will begin with the head
or spring of this famous River, and shew
how it glideth along in current, untill it
come to imbrace the bosome of the Sea,
and there to take up her entertainement
in his liquid armes. Giving credit to
such mens writings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The head or begin∣ning of the <HI>Thames</HI> out of the side of an Hill in <HI>Cotswold,</HI> neete to <HI>Tetbury.</HI></NOTE> as have (of set pur∣pose)

this famous streame hath her head or
beginning, out of the side of an Hill,
standing in the Plaines of <HI>Cotswold,</HI> a∣bout
a mile from <HI>Tetbury,</HI> neere unto

call it <HI>Thames</HI> even there; rather of a

how it was named at the first.
From hence it runneth directly toward

it runneth not many miles East,
and by South, till it fals into the mouth
of this River, which I doe now describe.
Last of all we come to the <HI>Medway,</HI> a
notable River, in mine opinion, wate∣ring
all the South, and Southwest parts
of <HI>Kent,</HI> in whose description we cannot
(at this time) proceed any further.</P>
<P>Having (in this manner) briefely
touched this Noble River, and such
Brookes as fall into the same: I will in∣sert
a word or two,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commo∣dities of this noble River.</NOTE> concerning the com∣modities
of the said River, which I will
performe with so much brevity as is
possible; hereby also finding out her
whole tract and course from the head,
to the fall thereof into the Sea. It appea∣reth
evidently, that the length thereof
is (at the least) an hundred and eighty
miles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The lēgth of the <HI>Thames,</HI> frō the head to the fall into the Sea.</NOTE> if it be measured by the journies
of the Land. And as it is in course, the
longest of the three famous Rivers of
this Ile: so is it nothing inferiour to
them, in abundance of all kind of Fish,
whereof it is hard to say, which of the
three have either most plenty, or grea∣test
variety, if the circumstances be du∣ly
weighed.</P>
<P>What some other write, concerning
the Rivers of their Countries, it skilleth
not, neither will I (as divers doe) invent
strange things of this Noble streame,
therewith to nobilitate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An hono∣rable affir∣mation of the River of <HI>Thames.</HI></NOTE> and make it
more honourable: But this will I in
plaine termes affirme, That it neither
swalloweth up bastards of the <HI>Celtish</HI>
Brood, nor casteth up the right-begot∣ten,
that are throwne in, (without hurt)
into their Mothers lappe: as <HI>Politian</HI>

the <HI>Tagus</HI> doth: but an infinite plenty
of excellent, sweet and pleasant Fish,
wherwith such as inhabit neere to her

<P>What should I speake of the fat and
sweet Salmons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great plenty of fat &amp; sweet Salmons taken in the <HI>Thames</HI> daily.</NOTE> dayly taken in this

Pearches, Smelts, Breames, Ro∣ches,
Daces, Gudgeons, Flounders,

know by experience better than I, by
reason of their daily trade of fishing in
the same. And albeit it seemeth from
time to time, to be (as it were) defrau∣ded
in sundry wise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The spoile and havok of cove∣tous Fi∣shermen.</NOTE> of these her large
commodities, by the insatiable avarice
of Fishermen: yet this famous River
complaineth commonly of no want, but
the more it loseth at one time, the more
it yeeldeth at another.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carps a Fish late brought into <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and later into the <HI>Thames.</HI></NOTE> Onely in Carpes

rage of Land-floods, that breake
open the heads and dammes of divers
Gentlemens Ponds, by which meanes
it became somewhat partaker also of
this said commodity, whereof (before)
it had no portion that I could ever
heare.</P>
<P>Oh that this worthy River might bee
spared but one yeere from Nets, &amp;c. but
alas, then should many a poore man be
undone.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The River choaked up with sands and shelves in many pla∣ces, a matter much pitttied, and requi∣ring re∣dresse.</NOTE> In the meane time it is lamen∣table
to see, how it is and hath beene
choked of late, with sands and shelves,
by the penning and wresting of the
course of the water for commodities
sake. But as this is an inconveniency
easily remedied, if good order were ta∣ken
for the redresse thereof: so now, the
fine or pay set upon the Ballast, some∣times
freely given to the Merchants by
Patent, even to the Lands end, <HI>(Iusques
aupoinct)</HI> will be another cause of harme
to this noble streame: and all through
an advantage taken at the want of an
<HI>(i)</HI> in the word <HI>ponct:</HI> which grew
through an errour committed by an
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
<HI>English</HI> Notarie, unskilfull in the <HI>French</HI>
tong, wherein that Patent was granted.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the said River floweth
and filleth all her chanels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The River ebbeth &amp; floweth every 12. houres, for the length of seventy miles.</NOTE> twice in the
day and night; that is, in every 12. houres
once, and this ebbing and flowing hol∣deth
on for the space of 70. miles with∣in
the maine Land: the streame or Tide
being alwaies highest at <HI>London,</HI> when
the moon doth exactly touch the north∣east,
and south or west points of the hea∣vens,
of which one is visible, the other
under the earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The alte∣ration and difference of the tides.</NOTE> &amp; not in our sight. These
Tides also differ in their times, each one
comming later than other, by so many
minutes as passe, yet the revolution and
naturall course of the heavens do reduce
and bring about the said Planet, to these
her former places, wherby, the common
difference between one Tide &amp; another,
is found to consist of 24. minutes, which
wanteth but 12. of a whole houre in 24.
as experience doth confirme. In like
sort,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The just distance between one tide &amp; another.</NOTE> we see by daily tryall, that each
Tide is not of equall height and great∣nesse.
For at the full and change of the
Moone, we have the greatest floods, and
such is their extraordinary course, that
as they diminish from their changes &amp;
fuls, unto the first and last quarters: so
afterwards they increase againe, untill
they come to the full and change.</P>
<P>Sometimes also they rise so high,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The extra∣ordinary rising of the tides, and how caused.</NOTE> (if
the wind be at the North or North-east,
which bringeth in the water with more
vehemency, because the Tide that fil∣leth
the channell, commeth from <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
ward) that the <HI>Thames</HI> overfloweth
her bankes neere unto <HI>London:</HI> which
hapneth especially in the fuls and chan∣ges
of <HI>Ianuary</HI> and <HI>February,</HI> wherein
the lower grounds are (of custome) soo∣nest
drowned. This order of flowing in
like sort is perpetuall, so that when the
Moone is on the South-west and North
of points, then is the water at <HI>London</HI> at
the highest. Neither doe the Tides al∣ter,
except some rough winds out of the
West or South-west, doe keepe backe
and checke the streame in her entrance:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The streame oftētimes checkt in her en∣trance into the Land.</NOTE> as the East and North-east doe hasten
the comming in thereof, or else some o∣ther
extraordinary occasion put by the
ordinary course of the Northerne Seas,
which doe fill the said River by their
naturall returne and flowing. And that
both these doe happen eftsoones a∣mong,
I referre me to such, as have not
seldome observed it: as also the sensible
chopping in of three or foure Tides in
one naturall day, whereof the unskilfull
doe descant many things, according to
their minds.</P>
<P>But howsoever these small matters doe
fall out,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two seve∣rall times of the Moone, the waters finde their true course</NOTE> and how often soever this course
of the streame doth happen to be distur∣bed:
yet at two severall times of the
Moone, the Waters returne to their na∣turall
course and limits of time exactly.
<HI>Polydore</HI> saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The error of <HI>Polydore Virgil.</HI></NOTE> that this River is seldome
increased, or rather never overfloweth
her banks by land-flouds: but he is here∣in
very much deceived, as it shall more
apparantly be seene hereafter. For the
more that this River is put by of her
right course, the more the water must
(of necessity) swell with the white wa∣ters,
which run downe from the Land:
because the passage cannot bee so swift
and ready in the winding, as in the
straight course.</P>
<P>The Land-flouds also doe greatly
staine the finenesse of the streame,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Land-floods doe much staine the streames finenesse.</NOTE> in∣somuch
that after a great land-floud,
you shall take up Haddocks with your
hands beneath the Bridge, as they float
aloft on the water: whose eyes are so
blinded with the thicknesse of that ele∣ment,
that they cannot see where to be∣come,
and make shift to save themselves
before death take hold on them.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thames</HI> water as cleere as that of the Sea.</NOTE> Other∣wise,
the water (of it selfe) is very cleere,
and, in comparison, next unto that of
the Sea, which is most subtill &amp; pure of
all other; as that of great Rivers is most
excellent in comparison of smal brooks.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The obje∣ction of <HI>A∣ristotle</HI> an∣swered.</NOTE>
Although <HI>Aristotle</HI> will have the salt
water to be most grosse, because a Ship
will beare a greater burden on the Sea,
than on the fresh water, and an Egge
sinks in this, that swimmeth in the o∣ther.
But he may easily be answered, by
the quantity of roome, and abundance
of waters in the Sea, whereby it becom∣meth
of more force, to sustaine such ves∣sels
as are committed to the same, and
whereunto the greatest Rivers are no∣thing
comparable.</P>
<P>I would here make mention of sundry
Bridges over this noble streame: of
which, that of <HI>London</HI> is most chiefely
to be commended: for it is (in a manner)
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
a continuall street, well replenished
with large and stately houses on both
sides, and situate upon twenty Arches,
whereof each one is made of excellent
free stone, every of them being three∣score
foot in height, and full twenty in
distance one from another, as I have of∣ten
viewed. In the like manner, I could
entreat of the infinite number of Swans
daily to be seene upon this River, and of
two thousand Wherries and small
Boats,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two thou∣sand boats upon the <HI>Thames,</HI> and 3000. pooremen maintai∣ned by the same, whole gaines come in most in the Terme time.</NOTE> whereby three thousand poore
Watermen are maintained, through
the carriage and recarriage of such per∣sons
as passe or repasse (from time to
time) upon the same. Beside, those huge
Tide-boats, Tilt-boats, and Barges,
which eyther carry passengers, or bring
necessary provision from all quarters of
<HI>Oxfordshire, Barkeshire, Buckinghamshire,
Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, Middlesex,
Essex, Surrey,</HI> and <HI>Kent,</HI> unto the Citie
of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus farre proceeded in the
description of this famous River, even
from her head and originall, till her im∣bracing
the Sea: I thought good to go
on a little further, concerning the extent
of the <HI>Thames</HI> jurisdiction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The extēt of the Ri∣ver of <HI>Thames</HI> un∣der the ju∣risdiction of the L. Maior, Commu∣nalty and Citizens of <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> from a place
called <HI>Colnie</HI> Ditch, a little above the
Bridge of <HI>Stanes</HI> westward, to <HI>London</HI>
Bridge: and from thence to a certaine
place called <HI>Yendall,</HI> alias <HI>Yenland,</HI> alias
<HI>Yenleete,</HI> and of the Water of <HI>Medway,</HI>
as being matter more proper to the Ci∣tie
of <HI>Londons</HI> Survey, than any other
discourse else whatsoever. For many
yeeres, the authority and jurisdiction of
this River, hath undoubtedly belonged
to the Lord Maior, Communalty, and
Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> by the sufficient te∣stimony
of divers Grants, Charters, and
Confirmations, made by the precedent
Kings and Queenes of this Land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts of Parliamēt for the Ci∣ties prero∣gative on the River.</NOTE> and
by our late deceased King <HI>Iames</HI> of hap∣py
memory, besides sundry Acts of Par∣liament
ordained to that end.</P>
<P>But because some question appeared
to be not long since made by the Lord
high Admirall of <HI>England,</HI> concerning
that case of Power or Jurisdiction, a full
and finall conclusion was at length esta∣blished,
betweene the Lord high Admi∣rall,
and the Lord Maior and Commu∣nalty
of <HI>London</HI> also, concerning the
Prerogative then questioned.</P>
<P>Whereby, as in former ancient pri∣viledges,
the right and title hath beene
alwaies evident; so then it appeared a
plaine and manifest case, that the Lord
Maior of <HI>London</HI> for the time being, and
his successors for ever in that eminent
dignity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lord Maior of <HI>London</HI> his title and authority over the River, and to inflict punishmēt on all of∣fenders.</NOTE> have full power and authority
over the said Rivers, the Lord Maior
bearing the stile and title of Conserva∣tor
or preserver of them, within the
forenamed bounds and limits; Having
absolute power, of inflicting punish∣ment
for all unlawfull fishings, eyther
by Fishermen or any other, fishing with∣in
the same at any time: yea, and to
search, oversee and punish all such, as
shall abuse his lawfull authority in those
proceedings from time to time. And
because his great and serious imploy∣ments
withhold him from such atten∣ding
on this important businesse, as the
urgent necessity thereof doth (almost
continually) require:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The water Bailiffe of <HI>London,</HI> his power on the River under the L. Maior.</NOTE> he hath a Deputy
or Substitute, named the Water-Bay∣liffe
of <HI>London,</HI> who under his Honours
authority, and by vertue of his more ab∣solute
power, doth continually search,
oversee and punish all offenders, that
dare infringe those rights of duty, be∣longing
to so famous a River, or make
spoile of that intended for generall be∣nefit.</P>
<P>And whereas there are a certaine
company of Fishermen,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tinckermen</HI> mighty de∣stroyers of the Frie of Fish.</NOTE> called <HI>Tincker∣men,</HI>
frequenting the River of <HI>Thames,</HI>
Eastward, who (in times past) not onley
have beene reported, but also manifest∣ly
approved, and found out, to make an
infinite destruction of the yong brood
and Fry of Fish, by use of unlawfull
Nets, and unpermittable Engines, fee∣ding
and glutting their Hogges with
them, as M. Doctor <HI>Dee</HI> reporteth: By
the diligent and extraordinary cost and
care of the Lord Maior, his Brethren,
and the rest of the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI>
as also the vigilant respect of his worthy
Officer the Water-Bayliffe, day and
night attending to cut off such an hor∣rible
abuse; those unlawfull Nets and
Engines are now quite supprest, and a
true &amp; orderly forme of fishing brought
into use,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Waste and spoile ve∣ry provi∣dently prevented and cut off.</NOTE> that such waste and havocke
may no more be made. Through which
restraint of robberie, and application of
continuall providence, our River of
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>
<HI>Thames</HI> (the honour and beauty of this
whole Iland) is become againe most
rich and plentifull, yeelding daily out
of her bountifull bosome, great store of
Fish of all kindes, and at much more
reasonable rate, than in many yeeres
past hath beene seene, as our weekely
Markets in this Honourable Citie, can
better testifie, than I report: a matter
highly to bee commended, and (no
doubt) but will bee as heedfully conti∣nued.</P>
<P>Vpon a great complaint lately made
to the Lord Maior,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Timbers in the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>Tilbury hope</HI> no meane hurt to the River.</NOTE> concerning Tim∣bers
being and standing in <HI>Tilbury Hope,</HI>
beneath <HI>Gravesend,</HI> a matter not onely
perillous to passengers upon the River,
but a cause also to destroy (infinitely)
the yong brood and fry of Fish, by the
harmes those Timbers did to Fisher∣mens
Nets, by reason of their continuall
standing in the maine course, and spee∣dy
current of the streame, which was
mightily annoyed and injured thereby:
his honourable care extended so farre,
that by the paines and diligence of his
Water-Bayliffe, being thereto by his
Office and place warrantably directed,
those grievous hurts and annoyances
were all taken up, and conveyed to the
Guildhall in <HI>London,</HI> as an example to
all that should dare to offend in the like
nature, or presume to prejudice such an
honourable course of our fishing, as it is
faithfully reported, at every Tide, by
day and night, foure Bushels of small
Fish and Fry, (continually throughout
the whole) are saved and preserved
by this worthy providence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The bene∣fit ensuing by taking up those annoying Timbers out of the streame.</NOTE> which other∣wise
had remained to the former despe∣rate
spoile, and continued a great hin∣drance
to the abounding increase now
likely to ensue thereby.</P>
<P>The Lord Maior and Communalty,
not many yeeres since, have caused this
Noble River of <HI>Thames</HI> westward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The clea∣ring and clensing of the River westward of stops &amp; hatches.</NOTE> to be
cleered and cleansed of 79. stops or
hatches, consisting of divers great stakes
and piles, purposely erected by Fisher∣men
for their private gaine, and stan∣ding
dangerous for passengers neere un∣to
the faire deepe: so that none of them
doe now remaine upon the River, but
onely such as stand out of the passable to
faire way, and can bee no prejudice to
passengers. For otherwise, they serve
as a great succour to the young breed
and Frie, being planted at the waters
bottome, and placed so remotely on the
River; that they releeve and comfort
many poore Fishermen thereon dwel∣ling.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some things see∣ming hurt∣full, may be benefi∣ciall as they are used.</NOTE> Beside, in the great heate and
drought of Summer, when usually wa∣ter
is most scanty, these are then the
cause of raising it so high, that Barges
may well and safely passe, with all kind
of goods to our ancient Mother Citie;
whereas else they would be grounded,
how many soever, and be void of pas∣sage,
by lownesse of the water.</P>
<P>There are likewise a number of Fi∣shermen
belonging to the River of
<HI>Thames,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tinckermen, Hebbermen, Petermen, Trawlermē,</HI> All great abusers of Gods bles∣sings in the River.</NOTE> some stiled by the name of
<HI>Tinckermen,</HI> others, <HI>Hebbermen, Peter∣men,
Trawlermen, &amp;c.</HI> that have lived
(in precedent times) by very unlawfull
fishing on this River, and to the great
injurie of her abounding store. But by
meanes of this wel-provided restriction,
so forwarded in the maine Magistrate,
and followed in the diligent endevour
of the carefull Water-Bayliffe, (making
no spare of his paines at all times what∣soever)
their insolence hath beene redu∣ced
to a more temperate qualification,
and the awfull hand of civill Govern∣ment
appeareth to carry much better
respect, than formerly it did.</P>
<P>Nor let this provident care, both for
the safety of passengers on the River,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Care had of the River of <HI>Thames</HI> in former times.</NOTE>
and preservation of the Breed, Frie, and
Fish in the River, bee understood as a
matter of novelty, without any prece∣dent
example in elder dayes; when it
plainely appeareth, that the very like
course was kept and effected in the time
of King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, the seventh
yeere of his reigne, <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1405.
Also more late in the dayes of King
<HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, &amp;c. As appeareth by
Records in divers Chronicles, and so
warranted and avouched, as already
hath beene said, and shall (in more am∣ple
manner) hereafter appeare.</P>
<P>Concerning the controversiall que∣stion,

<HI>Medway,</HI> all variance and difference was

said Rivers rights; and <HI>Thomas Sparrey,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>
Esquire, his Substiture, and respective
Water-Bayliffe, for the performing of
such a maine trust reposed in him, ap∣pertaining
justly unto his place and of∣fice.</P>
<P>At eight severall times yeerely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Courts kept for the yeere∣ly preser∣vation of the River.</NOTE> with∣in
the foure Countries of <HI>Middlesex,
Surrey, Kent,</HI> and <HI>Essex,</HI> the Lord Mai∣or

with his Brethren the Aldermen, for
the better maintaining of the Rivers
rights and priviledges, doe sit in per∣son
judicially, and charge foure Juries
by oath, to make inquisition after all
offences, committed upon the River of
<HI>Thames.</HI> And as the verdict (presented
by the said Jurie) maketh appearance,
so doe they accordingly proceed to the
punishment of the transgressors, answe∣rably
to the nature of their offences,
and as to Justice shall see me expedient:
Wherein, the Rivers prosperity, safety
of passengers, and generall good of the
Common-wealth, are their chiefest re∣spects.</P>
<P>And because it may appeare more

doe proceed in this case, by the

I have hereto added, the last Courts
that were kept about this Rivers service,
in the time of Sir <HI>Iohn Iolles,</HI> Knight, to
take away all sinister scruple or doubt,
that can be otherwise alledged. For he
being present in the Journey, (as I my
selfe might also have beene, if my

the course of all that then pas∣sed,
and as hee delivered it to mee, so
have I set it downe, with some other

cleansing is spared, and great profit
made by letting out the bankes, with
the spoile of the whole ditch.</P>
<P>I am not ignorant of two Fifteenes
granted by a common Councell, in the
yeere 1595. for the reformation of this
ditch, and that a small portion thereof,
to wit, betweene <HI>Bishopsgate</HI> and the Po∣sterne
called <HI>Mooregate,</HI> was cleansed,
and made somewhat broader than it
was before: but filling againe very fast,
by reason of over-raising the ground

the said House of Sisters being conver∣ted

as all other the great Bridges of this

kept the same in good reparations;
till at length, considering the great
charges which were bestowed in the re∣pairing
the same, there was (by ayd of

<P>But first of the Timber Bridge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Malmes.</NOTE> the
Antiquity thereof being great, but un∣certaine:
I remember to have read, that

both by water and by land, the Ci∣tizens
manfully defended themselves,

then, with a deepe Trench and straight
siege he compassed the City about.</P>
<P>Also 1052. E. <HI>Goodwin,</HI> with the like

<P>We read likewise, that in the yeere

<P>In the yeere 1136 the first of King
<HI>Stephen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. Berm.</NOTE> a fire began in the house of one
<HI>Ailewarde,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. Trin.</NOTE> neere unto <HI>London</HI> stone,
which consumed East to <HI>Ealdgate,</HI> and
West to S. <HI>Erkenwalds shrine</HI> in <HI>Pauls</HI>
Church:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>London</HI> Bridge brent.</NOTE> the Bridge of Timber over
the River of <HI>Thames</HI> was also burnt, &amp;c.
but afterwards againe repaired. For
<HI>Fitz stephen</HI> writeth, that in the Reigne
of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> and of <HI>Henry</HI> the 2.
when pastimes were shewed on the Ri∣ver
of <HI>Thames,</HI> men stood in great num∣ber
on the Bridge, Wharfes, and Hou∣ses,
to behold.</P>
<P>Now in the yeere 1163. the same
Bridge was not onely repayred but new
made of timber,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>London</HI> Bridge of Timber new built.</NOTE> as before, by <HI>Peter Cole-church,</HI>
Priest and Chaplaine.</P>
<P>Thus much for the old timber-bridge,
maintained partly by the proper Lands
thereof, partly by the liberality of di∣vers
persons, and partly by taxations in
divers Shires, as I have proved for the
space of 215. yeeres, before the Bridge
of stone was built.</P>
<P>Now touching the foundation of
the stone Bridge,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>London</HI> Bridge of stone founded.</NOTE> it followeth: About
the yeere 1176. the stone Bridge over
the River of <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> was be∣gun
to be founded by the foresaid <HI>Peter</HI>
of <HI>Cole-Church,</HI> neere unto the Bridge of
Timber, but somewhat more towards
the West: for I reade, that <HI>Buttolph</HI>-Wharfe
was in the Conquerours time
at the head of <HI>London</HI> Bridge.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. Waver∣ley.</NOTE> The King
assisted this worke: A Cardinall then
being Legate here, and <HI>Richard</HI> Arch∣bish.
of <HI>Cant.</HI> gave one thousand marks
towards the foundation. The course of
the River (for the time) was turned an∣other
way about by a Trench, cast for
that purpose; beginning (as is supposed)
east about <HI>Radriffe,</HI> and ending in the
west about <HI>Patricksey,</HI> now termed <HI>Bat∣tersey.</HI>
This worke, to wit, the Arches,
Chappell, and stone Bridge over the
<HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>London</HI> Bridge 33. yeeres in building.</NOTE> having been 33. yeers
in building, was in the yeere 1209. fini∣shed
by the worthy Merchants of <HI>Lon∣don,
Serle Mercer, William Almaine,</HI> and
<HI>Benedict Botewrite,</HI> principall masters of
that worke: for <HI>Peter Cole-Church</HI> decea∣sed
foure yeeres before, and was buried
in the Chappell on the Bridge, in the
yeere 1205.</P>
<P>King <HI>Iohn</HI> gave certaine void places
in <HI>London</HI> to build on, the profits thereof
to remaine towards the charges of buil∣ding
and repayring of the same Bridge.
A Mason, being Master-workman of
the Bridge, builded (from the foundati∣on)
the large Chappell on that Bridge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chappell on the Bridge, on the East side.</NOTE>
of his owne charges; which Chappell
was then endowed for two Priests, foure
Clarkes, &amp;c. besides Chanteries; since
founded by <HI>Iohn Hatfield,</HI> and others.
After the finishing of this Chappell,
which was the first building upon those
Arches, sundry houses (at times) were
erected, and many charitable men gave
lands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gifts givē to <HI>London</HI> Bridge, in a table no∣ted for po∣sterity.</NOTE> tenements, or summes of money
towards the maintenance thereof; all
which was sometimes noted, and in
a Table faire written for posterity:
<PB N="29" REF="22"/>
remaining in the Chappell, till the same
Chappell was turned to a dwelling
house, and then removed to the Bridge-house.
The effect of which Table I
was willing to have published, in this
Booke, if I could have obtained the sight
thereof: but making the shorter worke,
I finde by the accompt of <HI>William Mari∣ner</HI>
and <HI>Christopher Eliot,</HI> Wardens of
<HI>London</HI> Bridge, from <HI>Michaelmas</HI> the 22.

by particulars: by which accompt then
made, may be partly ghessed the great
charges and discharges of that Bridge
at this day, when things bee stretched
to so great a price. And now to actions
on this Bridge.</P>
<P>The first action to be noted, was la∣mentable:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Actions on <HI>London</HI> Bridge to be noted.</NOTE> for within foure yeeres after

by the fire; and it came to passe, that as
they stayed or protracted the time, the
other end of the Bridge also, namely,
the South end, was fired; so that the
people thronging themselves betweene
the two fires, did nothing else but ex∣pect
present death. Then there came
to aide them many ships and vessels, in∣to
which the multitude so unadvisedly
rushed, that the ships being thereby
drowned, they all perished. It was said,
that through the fire and shipwracke,
there were destroyed above three thou∣sand
persons, whose bodies were found
in part, or halfe burned, besides those
that were wholly burnt to ashes, and
could not be found.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Five ar∣ches of <HI>London</HI> Bridge borne downe.</NOTE></P>

was a great Justing on <HI>London</HI> Bridge,

Which History proveth, that at that
time the Bridge (being coaped on ey∣ther
side) was not replenished with hou∣ses
builded thereupon, as since it hath
beene, and now is.</P>
<P>The next yeere,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nine per∣sons crow∣ded to death on <HI>London</HI> Bridge.</NOTE> on the 30. of <HI>Novem∣ber,</HI>
the yong Queene <HI>Isabel,</HI> common∣ly

were crowded to death, of whom the

and a Matron on <HI>Cornehill,</HI> was another.</P>
<P>The Tower on <HI>London</HI> Bridge, at the

<P>In the yeere 1471. <HI>Thomas</HI> the Ba∣stard

<P>To conclude, of this Bridge over the
said River of <HI>Thames,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The bridge described.</NOTE> I affirme, as in o∣ther

very rare, having with the draw-bridge
20. arches, made of square stone, of
height 60. foot, and in bredth 30. foot,
distant one from another 20. foot, com∣pact
and joyned together with vaults
and cellars; upon both sides be houses
builded, so that it seemeth rather a con∣tinuall
street than a bridge: for the for∣tifying
whereof, against the incessant
assaults of the River, it hath overseers

and others.</P>
<P><HI>Fleet-bridge</HI> in the west,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fleet bridge.</NOTE> without <HI>Lud∣gate,</HI>
a bridge of stone, faire coaped on

towards the South, bee also certaine
Lanthornes of stone, for lights to be pla∣ced
in Winter evenings, for commodi∣ty
of travellers. Vnder this Birdge runs
a water, sometimes called (as I have
said) the River of the <HI>Wels;</HI> since, <HI>Turne∣mill</HI>

it runneth by the <HI>Fleet,</HI> and sometime

the River of <HI>Thames.</HI></P>
<P>This Bridge hath beene farre greater
in times past; but lessened, as the wa∣ter-course
hath beene narrowed.</P>
<P>It seemeth, this last Bridge to bee
made or repaired at the charges of <HI>Iohn
Wels</HI> Maior, in the yeere 1431: for on
the coping is ingraved, Wels imbraced
by Angels, like as on the Standard in

that of old time, every person having
Lands on either side of the said brooke,
should cleanse the same, and mend and
repaire the bridges so far as their Lands
extended.</P>
<P>More, in the eleventh of <HI>Edward</HI> the
third, the inhabitants upon the course
of this brooke, were forced to pile and
wall the sides thereof.</P>
<P>Also, that in the third of <HI>Henry</HI> the
fifth, this water-course had many brid∣ges,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Walbrooke</HI> vaulted o∣ver, and paved with stone</NOTE>
since vaulted over with bricke, and
the streets where-through it passed, so
paved, that the same water-course is

taken in the second of <HI>Edw.</HI> the fourth,
<PB N="31" REF="23"/>
that such persons as had any ground ly∣ing

<P>THe next Gate in the East,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ealdgate.</NOTE> is

for that (as it may be supposed)
the same was first builded by some Bi∣shop

this Gate was first builded for the case
of passengers toward the East, and by

<P>THe next Gate on the West and
by North,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Newgate.</NOTE> is termed <HI>Newgate,</HI> a
latelier builded than the rest, &amp;
is the fifth principall Gate. This Gate
was first erected about the reigne of
<HI>Henry</HI> the first, or of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> upon
this occasion. The Cathedrall Church
of Saint <HI>Paul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pauls</HI> Church in <HI>London</HI> new buil∣ded.</NOTE> being burnt about the
yeere 1086. in the Reigne of <HI>William</HI>
the Conqueror, <HI>Mauritius,</HI> then Bishop
of <HI>London,</HI> repaired not the old Church,
as some have supposed; but began the
foundation of a new worke, such as men
then judged would never have beene
performed, it was to them so wonder∣full
for heighth, length, and breadth;
as also in respect it was raised upon Ar∣ches
or vaults, a kinde of workmanship
brought in by the <HI>Normans,</HI> and never
knowne to the Artificers of this Land
before that time, &amp;c. After <HI>Mauritius,
Richard Beaumore</HI> did wonderfully ad∣vance
the worke of the said Church,
purchasing the large Streets and Lanes
round about, wherein were wont to
dwell many lay people; which grounds
he beganne to compasse about with a
strong wall of stone, and Gates.</P>
<P>By meanes of this increase of the
Church territory, but more by inclo∣sing
of ground for so large a Coemitery,
or Church-yard; the high and large
Street, stretching from <HI>Ealdgate</HI> in the
East, to <HI>Ludgate</HI> in the West, was in
this place so crossed and stopped up,
that the carriage through the City
westward, was forced to passe without
the said Churchyard wall on the North
side, through <HI>Pater noster row,</HI> and then
South down <HI>Ave Marie lane,</HI> and againe
West through <HI>Bowyer row</HI> to <HI>Ludgate:</HI>
or else out of <HI>Cheape,</HI> or <HI>Wathelingstreete,</HI>
to turne South, through the <HI>old Change,</HI>
then West through <HI>Carter lane,</HI> againe
North up <HI>Creed lane,</HI> and then west to
<HI>Ludgate.</HI> Which passage, by reason of
so often turning, was very cumbersome
and dangerous, both for horse and man.
For remedy whereof, a new Gate was
made,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Newgate</HI> first buil∣ded, and the cause why.</NOTE> and so called, by which men and
cattell, with all manner of carriages,
might passe more directly (as before)
from <HI>Ealdgate,</HI> through <HI>West Cheape</HI> by
<HI>Pauls,</HI> on the North side, through S.
<HI>Nicholas</HI> shambles and <HI>Newgate Market,</HI>
to <HI>Newgate:</HI> and from thence to any
part Westward over <HI>Oldborne-bridge,</HI> or
turning without the Gate into <HI>Smith∣field,</HI>
and through <HI>Iseldon,</HI> to any part
North and by West.</P>
<P>This Gate hath of long time beene a
Gaole or Prison for Felons and Trespas∣sers,
as appeareth by Records in the
reigne of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> and of other Kings:
amongst the which, I finde one testify∣ing,
that in the yeere 1218. the third of

<P>Moreover, in the yeere 1241. the
<HI>Iewes</HI> of <HI>Norwich</HI> were hanged, for cir∣cumcising
a Christian child, their house

<P>This place, and one other of his
Armes, being 3. broad Arrow-heads,
taken downe with the old Gate, I cau∣sed
to be fixed over the entry of the said
Quadrant: but the verses being unhap∣pily
turned inward to the wall, procu∣red
the like in effect to be ingraven out∣ward
in prose, declaring him to bee a
Fishmonger, because some, upon a
light ocasion (as a Maydens head in a
glasse window) had fabled him to be a
Mercer, and to have begd there at <HI>Lud∣gate,</HI>
&amp;c. Thus much for <HI>Ludgate.</HI></P>
<P>Next this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A breach in the Wall against <HI>Bridewell.</HI></NOTE> there is a breach in the

<P>But <HI>Ripa Regina,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Queen Hith</NOTE> the <HI>Queenes Banke,</HI>

as shall be shewed in the Ward

<P>The next is <HI>Downgate,</HI> so called of the
sudden descending, or downe going of
that way, from Saint <HI>Iohns</HI> Church up∣on
<HI>Walbroke</HI> unto the River of <HI>Thames,</HI>
whereby the water in the Chanell there
hath such a swift course, that in the

after a strong showre of raine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Lad of 18 yeeres old drow∣ned in a Channell at <HI>Downe∣gate.</HI></NOTE> a Lad of
the age of eighteene yeeres, minding to
have leapt over the Channell, was ta∣ken
by the feet, and borne downe with
the violence of that narrow streame,
and carried toward the <HI>Thames</HI> with
such a violent swiftnesse, as no man
could rescue or stay him, till hee came
against a Cart-wheele, that stood in the
Watergate, before which time, he was
drowned and starke dead.</P>
<P>This was sometime a large water-gate
frequented of ships, and other vessels,
like as the <HI>Queenes Hithe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An inqui∣sition con∣cerning <HI>Dewnegate.</HI></NOTE> and was a part
thereof, as doth appeare by an inquisiti∣on,
made in the 28. yeere of <HI>Henry</HI> the

corne as fish, and all other things comming
to the Port of</HI> Downgate, <HI>were to be orde∣red
after the customes of the</HI> Queens Hith
<HI>for the Kings use.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Merchants of the Hanse, landed their corn betwixt their house and the <HI>Black Friers.</HI></NOTE> <HI>As also, that the corne

<HI>Castle; was to bee measured by the
measure, and measurer of the Queenes Soke,
or</HI> Queen Hithe. I read also, in the 19.
of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>That customes were
then to bee paid for ships and other ves∣sels,
resting at</HI> Downgate, <HI>as if they roade
at</HI> Queene Hith, and as they now doe
at <HI>Belinsgate.</HI> But now it is fallen to such
great decay, that not onely there is no
use made thereof, but also by reason
that the Water-gates are not repaired,
it is very dangerous to passengers
travelling through in the night season.
And thus much for <HI>Downegate</HI> may suf∣fice.</P>

<P>Ye have before heard, that the wall

with Towers and Bulwarkes, in

also that the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> with her
ebbing and flowing, on the South-side,
had subverted the said Wall, and Tow∣ers
there. Wherefore King <HI>William,</HI> for
defence of this Citie, in place most dan∣gerous,
and open to the enemy, having
taken downe the second Bulwarke in
the East part of the Wall, from the
<HI>Thames,</HI> builded this Tower, which was
the great square Tower, now called the
white Tower; and hath beene since (at

<P>In the yeere 1153. the Tower of <HI>Lon∣don</HI>

<P>In the yeere 1155. <HI>Thomas Becket,</HI> be∣ing

caused the <HI>Flemmings</HI> to be banished out

embattailed; and also caused a deepe

(as I have said before) to have en∣vironed
it with the River of <HI>Thames.</HI> By
making of this inclosure and ditch in
<HI>Eastsmithfield,</HI> the Church of the holy

and to the Church of the holy <HI>Trinitie</HI>
aforesaid; which was no small losse and
discommodity to either part. And the
Garden, which the King had hyred of
the brethren for sixe markes the yeere,
for the most part was wasted and mar∣red
by the ditch. Recompence was of∣ten
promised, but never performed, till
King <HI>Edward</HI> comming after, gave to
the Brethren five Markes and an halfe,
for that part which the ditch had de∣voured:
and the other part thereof
without he yeelded them againe, which
they hold; and of the said rent of five
Markes and an halfe, they have a Deed,
by vertue whereof they are well paid to
this day.</P>
<P>It is also to be noted, and cannot bee
denyed, but that the said inclosure and
ditch, tooke the like or greater quanti∣ty
of ground from the Citie within the
VVall; namely, on that part called the
Tower Hill, besides breaking downe of
the Citie VVall, from the white Tower
to the first Gate of the Citie, called the
Posterne. Yet have I not read of any
quarrell made by the Citizens, or re∣compence
demanded by them for that
matter; because all was done for good
of the Cities defence thereby, and to
their good likings.</P>
<P><HI>But</HI> Matthew Paris <HI>writeth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. Paris.</NOTE> <HI>that in
the yeere 1239.</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> the third
fortified the Tower of <HI>London</HI> to another
end;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bulwarkes of the Tower builded.</NOTE> wherefore the Citizens fearing, lest
that was done to their detriment, complai∣ned,
and the King answered: That hee had
not done it to their hurt; But (saith he) I
will from henceforth doe as my brother doth,
in building and fortifying Castles, who bea∣reth
the name to be wiser than I am.</P>
<P>It followed in the next yeere,<NOTE PLACE="marg">West gate and Bul∣warkes of the Tower fell downe</NOTE> <HI>(saith
mine Author)</HI> the said Noble buildings
of the stone Gate and Bulwarke, which the
King had caused to be made by the Tower of
<HI>London,</HI> on the West side thereof, was sha∣ken
as it had beene with an Earthquake, and
fell downe; which the King againe comman∣ded
to be built in better sort than before,
which was done.</P>
<P>And yet againe, in the yeere 1241. the
said Wall and Bulwarkes that were newly
builded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wall and Bulwarkes againe fall downe, and new builded.</NOTE> wherein the King had bestowed
more than twelve thousand Markes, were
unrecoverably quite throwne downe, as a∣fore:
for the which chance, the Citizens of
<HI>London</HI> were nothing sorry: for they were
threatned, that the said wall and Bulwarkes
were builded, to the end, that if any of them
would contend for the liberties of the Citie,
<PB N="42" REF="30"/>
they might be imprisoned: And that many
might be laid in divers prisons, many lod∣gings
were made, that no one should speake
with another.</P>
<P>Thus much <HI>Matthew Paris</HI> avoucheth
for this building.</P>
<P>More of <HI>Henry</HI> the third his dealings
against the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> we may
read in the said Author, in 1245. 1248.
1249. 1253. 1255. 1256. &amp;c. But con∣cerning
the said Wall and Bulwarke,
the same was finished, though not in
his time. For I read, <HI>That</HI> Edward <HI>the
first, in the second of his reigne, commanded
the Treasurer and Chamberlaine of the Ex∣chequer,
to deliver out of his Treasurie, un∣to</HI>
Miles of Andwarp, 200. <HI>Markes, of

now called the <HI>Lion Tower.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I find also recorded, that</HI> Henry <HI>the

Edward <HI>of</HI> Westminster, <HI>commanding
him,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">H. 3. his Orchard by the Tower.</NOTE> That hee should buy certaine Perie
Plants, and set the same in the place without
his Tower of <HI>London,</HI> the ninth of <HI>Edward</HI>
the second.</P>
<P><HI>Edward</HI> the fourth in place whereof
builded a wall of Bricke. But now for
the <HI>Lion-Tower,</HI> and Lions in <HI>England,</HI>
the originall, as I have read, was thus:</P>
<P>Henry <HI>the first builded the Mannor
of</HI> Woodstocke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">First Parke in <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> <HI>with a Parke which hee
walled about with stone, seven miles in
compasse, destroying for the same, di∣vers
Villages, Churches and Chappels,
and this was the first Parke in</HI> England;
<HI>the words of the Record are these fol∣lowing:</HI>
He appointed therein (beside great
store of Decre) divers strange beasts, to be
kept and nourished, such as were brought
to him from far Countries; as Lions, Leo∣pards,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lions in <HI>Woodstocke</HI> Parke.</NOTE> Linxes, Porpentines, and such other:
For such was his estimation among outlan∣dish
Princes, that few would willingly of∣fend him.</P>
<P>More I read, that in the yeere 1235.
<HI>Fredericke</HI> the Emperour sent to <HI>Henry</HI>
the third, three Leopards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lions sent to <HI>Hen. 3.</HI> and kept in the Tower.</NOTE> in token of
his regall Shield of Armes, wherein
three Leopards were pictured: since
which time, those Lions, and others,
have beene kept in a part of this Bul∣warke,
now called the <HI>Lion Tower,</HI> and
their keeper there lodged. King <HI>Edward</HI>
the second, in the twelfth yeere of his
reigne, commanded the Sheriffes of
<HI>London,</HI> to pay the keeper of the Kings
Leopards in the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> 6. <ABBR>d</ABBR>
the day, for the sustenance of the Leo∣pards;
and three halfe-pence a day, for
dyet of the said keeper, out of the fee-farme
of the said Citie.</P>
<P>More, the 16. of <HI>Edward</HI> the third,
one Lion, one Lionesse, one Leopard,
and two Cattes Lions, in the said Tow∣er,
were committed to the custody of
<HI>Robert,</HI> the sonne of <HI>Iohn Bowre.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Edward</HI> the fourth fortified the Tow∣er
of <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Edw. the 4. builded bulwarks without the Tower▪</NOTE> and inclosed with Bricke
(as is aforesaid) a certaine piece of
ground, taken out of the Tower hill,
west from the Lion Tower, now called
the Bulwarke. His Officers also, in the
fifth of his reigne, set upon the said Hill
both Scaffold and Gallowes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seaffold and Gal∣lowes first set on Tower Hill.</NOTE> for the ex∣ecution
of offenders; whereupon the
Maior &amp; his brethren cōplained to the
King, and were answered, that the same
was not done in derogation of the Ci∣ties
Liberties; and therefore caused
proclamation to be made, &amp;c. as shall
be shewed in Towerstreet.</P>
<P><HI>Richard</HI> the third repaired and buil∣ded
this Tower somewhat.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rich. 3.</HI> re∣paired the Tower.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> the 8. in 1532. repaired the

<P>In the yeere 1548. the second of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>
the sixth, on the 22. of <HI>November,</HI>
in the night, a Frenchman lodged in
the round Bulwarke, betwixt the West
Gate and the Posterne, or draw bridge,
called the Warders Gate, by setting fire
on a barrell of Gunpowder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A bulwark of the To∣wer blown up.</NOTE> blew up the
said Bulwarke, burnt himselfe, and no
moe persons. This Bulwarke was again
forthwith new builded.</P>
<P>And here, because I have (by occasi∣on)
spoken of the west gate of this Tow∣er;
the same (as the most principall)
is used for the receipt and delivery of all
kindes of carriages;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gates and Posterne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Tower.</NOTE> without the which
Gate, be divers Bulwarkes and Gates,
turning towards the North, &amp;c. Then
neere within this West gate, opening
to the South, is a strong Posterne for
passengers, by the Ward-house, over a
draw-bridge, let downe for that pur∣pose.
Next, on the same South side, to∣ward
the East, is a large water-gate, for
<PB N="43" REF="30"/>
receipt of Boats and small vessels, partly
under a stone bridge, from the River of
<HI>Thames.</HI> Beyond it is a small Posterne,
with a draw-bridge, seldome let down,
but for the receipt of some great per∣sons,
prisoners. Then towards the East
is a great and strong Gate, commonly
called the Iron gate, but not usually o∣pened.
And thus much for the founda∣tion,
building, and repairing of this
Tower, with the Gates and Posternes,
may suffice. And now somewhat of ac∣cidents
in the same, shall be shewed.</P>

being found in the morning by the

were driven into his brest, between both

also were paid in starlings, which were
pence so called: for other coynes they
had none.</P>
<P>The antiquity of this starling penny
usually in this Realme, is from the reigne

the <HI>Saxon</HI> coynes (before the Conquest)
were pence of fine silver, the full weight

<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> the first his penny was of

crosse, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This <HI>Henry,</HI> in the eighth yeere of his
reigne, ordained the penny which was
round, so to be quartered by the crosse,
that they might easily bee broken into
halfe pence and farthings.</P>
<P>In the first, second, third, fourth, and
fifth of King <HI>Richard</HI> the first his reigne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">R. Hoveden.</NOTE>
and afterwards, I finde commonly Ea∣sterling
money mentioned, and yet oft∣times
the same is called <HI>Argent,</HI> as afore,
and not otherwise.</P>
<P>The first great sum that I read of to
be paid in Easterlings, was in the fifth
of <HI>Richard</HI> the first, when <HI>Robert</HI> Earle of
<HI>Leicester,</HI> being prisoner in <HI>France,</HI> prof∣fered
for his ransome a thousand marks
Easterlings; notwithstanding, the Ea∣sterling
pence were long before.</P>
<P>The weight of the Easterling penny
may appeare by divers Statutes, name∣ly,
of weights and measures, made in
the 51. yeere of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, in these
words:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Weight of starling pence 32. graines of wheat.</NOTE> <HI>Thirty two graines of Wheat, dry
and round, taken in the middest of the eare,
should be the weight of a starling penny;
twenty of those pence should weigh one ounce,
twelve ounces a pound Troy.</HI> It followeth
in the Statute, <HI>Eight pound to make a gal∣lon
of Wine, and eight gallons, a bushell of</HI>
London <HI>measure, &amp;c.</HI> Notwithstanding
which Statute, I finde in the eighth of
<HI>Edward</HI> the first, <HI>Gregorie Rokesley,</HI> Mai∣or
of <HI>London,</HI> being chiefe Master or Mi∣nister
of the Kings Exchange or Mints,
a new coyne being then appointed, the
pound of Easterling money should con∣taine
(as afore) 12. ounces, to wit, fine
silver, such as was then made into foyle,
and was commonly called silver of <HI>Gu∣thurons
lane;</HI> 11. ounces, two Easter∣lings,
and one ferling or farthing, and
the other 17. pence halfepenny farthing
to be lay. Also the pound of money
ought to weigh 20. shillings 3. pence
by account; so that no pound ought to
be over 20. shillings 4. pence, nor lesse
than 20. shillings 2. pence by account;
the ounce to weigh 20. pence, the pen∣ny
weight 24. graines. Which 24. by
weight then appointed, were as much
as the former 32. graines of Wheat: a
penny force, 25. graines and an halfe;
the penny deble or feeble, 22. graines
and an halfe, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now for the penny Easterling,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pen∣ny Easter∣ling how it tooke the name.</NOTE> how
it tooke that name, I think good briefe∣ly
to touch. It hath beene said, that <HI>Nu∣ma
Pompilius,</HI> the second King of the
<HI>Romanes,</HI> commanded monies first to be
made, of whose name they were called
<HI>Numi;</HI> and when copper pence, silver
pence, and gold pence were made, (be∣cause
every silver penny was worth ten
copper pence, and every gold penny
worth ten silver pence) the pence were
therefore called in Latine, <HI>Denarij;</HI> and
oftentimes, the pence are named of the
matter or stuffe of gold or silver. But
the Money of <HI>England</HI> was called of the
workers and makers thereof: as the Flo∣ren
of gold is called of the Florentines,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>H. 2.</HI> made a new coyne in the third of his reigne.</NOTE>
that were the workers thereof; and so
the Easterling pence tooke their name
of the Easterlings, which did first make
this money in <HI>England,</HI> in the reigne of
<HI>Henry</HI> the second.</P>
<P>Thus have I set downe, according to
my reading in Antiquity, of money
matters;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Starling money, when it tooke be∣ginning in this Land.</NOTE> omitting the imaginations of
late Writers; of whom some have said,
Easterling money to take that name of a
starre stamped in the border or ring of
the penny: othersome, of a bird, called
a Stare or Starling, stamped in the cir∣cumference:
and other (more unlikely)
of being coyned at <HI>Strivelin</HI> or <HI>Starling,</HI>
a Towne in <HI>Scotland.</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now concerning halfepence and far∣things,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of halfe pence and farthings.</NOTE> the accompt of which is more
subtiler than the pence, I need not speak
of them more, than that they were only
made in the Exchange at <HI>London,</HI> and
no where else: First, pointed to be made
by <HI>Edward</HI> the first, in the eighth of his
<PB N="46" REF="32"/>
reigne: and also at the same time, the
said Kings coine was some few groats of
silver, but they were not usuall. The
Kings Exchange at <HI>London</HI> was neere
unto the Cathedrall Church of S. <HI>Paul,</HI>
and is to this day commonly called, the
<HI>Old Change;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Old Change.</NOTE> but in Evidences, the <HI>Old

<P>The Kings Exchanger in this place,
was to deliver out to every other Ex∣changer

and when the same were spent and

<P>King <HI>Edward</HI> the first, in the 27. of
his reigne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Starling mony for∣bidden to be tran∣sported.</NOTE> held a Parliament at <HI>Stebun∣beth,</HI>
in the house of <HI>Henry Waleis,</HI> Maior

things there handled, the transporting

<P><HI>In the yeere 1351.</HI> William Edington,

England, <HI>a wise man, but loving the

conteyning in weight according to the pence
called Easterling, but much lesse, to wit,
by 5. <HI>s.</HI> in the pound: by reason whereof,
victuals and merchandizes became the dea∣rer
through the whole Realme.</P>
<P>About the same time also, the old
coyne of gold was changed into a new;
but the old Floren or Noble, then so
called, was worth much above the tax∣ed
rate of the new. And therefore the
Merchants ingrossed up the old, and
conveied them out of the Realme, to the
great losse of the Kingdome.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coyns of gold en∣haunced.</NOTE> Where∣fore
a remedy was provided, by chan∣ging

<P>In the yeere 1411. King <HI>Henry</HI> the

should be a pound, <HI>Troy</HI> weight.</P>
<P>In the yeere 1421. was granted to

Candlemas, and at Martinmasse, of
such money as was then currant gold,
or silver, not overmuch clipped or wa∣shed,
to wit, That if the Noble were

white mony,<NOTE PLACE="marg">More plē∣ty of coyn in gold than in sil∣ver.</NOTE> that though a Noble were
so good of gold, and weight, as six shil∣lings
eight pence; men could get no
white money fro them.</P>
<P>In the yeere 1465. King <HI>Edward</HI> the
fourth caused a new coyne, both of gold
and silver to be made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coines of gold allay∣ed, and al∣so raised in value.</NOTE> whereby he gai∣ned

<P><HI>W.</HI> Lord <HI>Hastings</HI> the Kings Cham∣berlaine,

that many yeeres after they used Lea∣ther

much for Mint, and coynage, by occa∣sion

now to other accidents there.</P>

of great troubles. For divers
Courtiers, desirous to enrich them∣selves
with other mens goods, enformed
the King and his Court, that the tallage
was not gathered up faithfully to the
Kings use by the Collection. Where∣upon,
they offered to the King, that
<PB N="48" REF="33"/>
they would pay a great summe of mo∣ney
for the farme of that, which they
would gather over and above that which
had beene paid, if they might be by the

<P>Some of them getting the Kings Let∣ters
and Authority,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The peo∣ple misu∣sed in ve∣ry base manner.</NOTE> sate in divers places

house of <HI>Iohn</HI> (others say <HI>Watt) Tylar,</HI> in
the Towne of <HI>Dartford</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> deman∣ded
of the <HI>Tylars</HI> wife, for her Husband,
for her selfe, for her servants, and for

wife denyed not to pay, saving for her
daughter; who (she said) was a childe,
and not to bee accounted as a woman.
That will I soone wete (answered the
Collector) and taking the yong maiden
dishonestly turned her up to search
whether shee were under-growne with
haire, or not; for in many places they
had made the like shamefull tryall.
Whereupon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The hus∣band com∣meth home ha∣stily from his worke.</NOTE> her mother cryed out,
which caused neighbours to come in,
and her husband (being at worke in the
same Towne, tyling of an house) when

in his hand, and ran presently
home: where reasoning with the Col∣lector;
who made him to be so bold? The

strake at the <HI>Tylar.</HI> But the <HI>Tylar</HI> avoy∣ding
the blow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Col∣lector slaine by the Tylar.</NOTE> smotethe Collector with
his Lathing-staffe, that the braines flew
out of his head: where-through great
noyse arose in the streets, and the poore

to support the said <HI>Iohn Tylar.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Commons being drawne
together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Com∣mons flocke to∣gether in the Tylars defence.</NOTE> went to <HI>Maidstone,</HI> and from

so (in short time) they stirred all the

Then, besetting the waies that
led to <HI>Canterbury,</HI> arrested all passengers,
compelling them to sweare:<NOTE PLACE="marg">An oath exacted by the Rebels on all pas∣sengers.</NOTE> <HI>First, that

beauty and statelinesse) they might set
it on fire, and burne it downe to the
ground.</P>
<P>Straightway they ran thither, and set∣ting
fire on it round about, applied their
travell to destroy it. And that it might
appeare to the Communalty, that they
did not any thing for avarice: they cau∣sed
to be proclaimed, that none (upon
paine of losing his head) should pre∣sume
to convert to his owne use,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Re∣bels would have no∣thing to a∣ny private mans use.</NOTE> any
thing that was there; but that they
should breake such Plate, and vessels of
Gold and Silver (as was there in great
plenty) into small pieces, and then to
throw the same into the <HI>Thames,</HI> and to
all (whatsover) was destroyed. But
one of the Rebels (saith <HI>Henry Kniton)</HI>
contrary to the Proclamation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ex Hen. Kniton.</NOTE> tooke a
goodly silver piece, and hid it in his bo∣some:
but another that espied him, told
his fellowes, who (forthwith) hurled
him and the piece of Plate into the fire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Re∣bels burne one of these fel∣lowes.</NOTE>
saying, <HI>We be zealous of Truth and Iustice,
and not theeves or robbers.</HI> Also, two and
thirty of those Rebels entred a Celler of
the <HI>Savoy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Two and thirty Re∣bels mu∣red up in a Celler.</NOTE> where they dranke so much
of sweet Wines, that they were not able
to come out againe in time: but were
shut in with wood and stones, that mu∣red
up the doore, where they were heard
crying and calling seven dayes after, but
none came to helpe them our, till they
were all dead.</P>
<P>These things being done,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The new Temple of <HI>London</HI> burnt, in anger to Sir <HI>Robert Hales.</HI></NOTE> they brake
downe the place called the new Tem∣ple
at the Barre, in which place, Ap∣prentices
at the Law were lodged: for
anger which they had conceived against
Sir <HI>Robert Hales,</HI> Master of Saint <HI>Iohns</HI>
Hospitall, unto which Hospitall of St.
<HI>Iohns</HI> the <HI>Temple</HI> belonged, where ma∣ny
Monuments, which the Lawyers had
in their custody, were consumed with
fire. After a number of them had sac∣ked
this <HI>Temple:</HI> what with wearinesse
of labour, and what with Wine, being
overcome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Re∣bels mur∣ther one another.</NOTE> they lay downe under the
wals and housing, and were slaine like
Swine; one of them killing another for
old grudges, and other also made quick
dispatch of them.</P>
<P>Another troope (in the meane time)
set fire on the noble house of Saint <HI>Iohn</HI>
at <HI>Clarkenwell,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prio∣ry of Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> be∣yond <HI>Smithfield</HI> burnt.</NOTE> causing it to burne by the

any to quench it. On Friday, they
burned the Manor of <HI>Highburie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ma∣nor of <HI>Highbury</HI> burnt.</NOTE> the
whole number of the Common people
(being at that time) divided into three
parts. Of the which division,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Re∣bels divi∣ded into 3. bands.</NOTE> one part
was attending to destroy the Manor of
<HI>Highbury,</HI> and other places belonging to
the Priory of Saint <HI>Iohn.</HI> Another com∣pany
lay at the <HI>Miles-end,</HI> East of the
City. The third kept at the Tower-hill,
There to spoile the King of such victu∣als,
as were brought toward him. The
company that were assembled on the
<HI>Miles-end,</HI> sent to command the King,
<PB N="50" REF="34"/>
that hee should come to them without
delay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Re∣bels com∣mand the King, and hee goeth to them to the <HI>Miles-end.</HI></NOTE> unarmed, or without any force:
which if he refused to doe, they would
pull downe the Tower, neither should
he escape alive. The King taking coun∣sell,
with a few unarmed, went toward
them in great feare on Horseback: and
so the Gates of the Tower being set o∣pen,
a great multitude of them entred
into it.</P>
<P>There was (at the same time) within
the Tower 600. Armed valiant persons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Re∣bels en∣tred into the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> and their impudent behaviour there.</NOTE>
and expert in Armes, and sixe hundred
Archers: all which did quaile in sto∣macke,
and stood as men amazed. For
the basest of the Rusticks (not many to∣gether,
but every one by himselfe) durst
presume to enter the Kings Chamber,
and his Mothers, with their weapons,
to put in feare each of the men of War,
Knights and other. Many of them went
into the Kings Privie-Chamber, and
played the wantons, in sitting, lying
and sporting them on the Kings Bed.
And that which is much more sawcily,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their bold insolence to the Kings Mo∣ther.</NOTE>
invited the Kings Mother, to kisse with
them: yet durst none of those men of
Warre (strange to bee said) once with∣stand
them: they went in and out like
Masters, that were but base slaves, and
of most vile condition.</P>
<P>While these rude wretches sought
for the Archbishop,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Re∣bels sought for the Archbi∣shop of <HI>Canturbury.</HI></NOTE> running up and
downe with terrible noyse and fury: at
length, finding one of his servants, they
charged him to bring them where his
Master was, whom they named Tray∣tor.
The servant not daring to displease
them, brought them to the Chappell:
where, after <HI>Masse</HI> had been said, and
having received the Communion, the
Arch-bishop was busie in his prayers:
for,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arch∣bishop dreadlesse of the Re∣bels cruel∣ty, and his speeches with them.</NOTE> not unknowing of their comming
and purpose, he had passed the last night
in confessing of his sinnes, and in devout
prayers. When therefore he heard that
they were come, with great constancy,
he said to his men: <HI>Let us now goe, surely
it is best to dye, when it is no pleasure to
live.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arch∣bishop is fetcht out of the Tower, and drag∣ged to the Tower hil.</NOTE> And with that, the tormentors en∣tring,
cryed, Where is the Traytor?
The Archbishop answered: Behold, I
am the Archbishop, whom you seeke,
not a Traytor. They therfore laid hands
on him, and dragging him out of the
Chappell, they drew him forth of the
Tower gate, to the Tower-hill, where
being compassed about with many
thousands, and seeing swords about his
head drawn in excessive manner, threat∣ning
death to him, he spake unto them
in these words.</P>
<P><HI>What is it (deare brethren) you purpose
to doe?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arch∣bishops words to the Rebels on Tower hill.</NOTE> <HI>What is mine offence committed a∣gainst

indignation of the iust Revenger, or (at the
least) for such a fact, all</HI> England <HI>be not put
under interdiction.</HI> Vnneath could hee
pronounce these words, before they cry∣ed
out with an horrible noise: That they
neither feared the interdiction, nor al∣lowed
the Pope to be above them. The
Archbishop seeing death at hand, with
comfortable words (as hee was an
eloquent man, and wise, beyond all the
wise men of the Realme) spake fairely
to them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arch∣bishop of <HI>Canturbury</HI> most cru∣elly behea∣ded by the Rebels.</NOTE> Lastly, after forgivenesse gran∣ted
to the executioner, that should be∣head
him, kneeling down, he offered his
necke to him that should imite off his
head. Being stricken in the necke, but
not deadly, hee putting his necke, said,
Aha, it is the hand of God. He had not
removed his hand from the place where
the paine was, but that being suddenly
stricken againe, his fingers ends being
cut off, and part of the Arteries, he fell
downe, but yet he dyed not, till being
mangled with 8. severall strokes in the
necke and head, he fulfilled most wor∣thy
Martyrdome.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The inhu∣manity to his body after hee was dead</NOTE> There lay his body
unburied all that Friday, and the mor∣row

a pole, and set it on <HI>London Bridge,</HI> in

required many things, which they

<P>The King perceiving that he could not

the <HI>Essex</HI> men returned homeward. On

see if they had done any mischiefe there.
Then went he to the Chappell, called
our <HI>Lady</HI> in the <HI>Piew,</HI> where hee made
his prayers: and returning by the Sub∣urbes
of West Smithfield, he found all
that place full of people, to wit, the

That he desired peace, but with
conditions to his liking, meaning, to
seed the King with faire words untill
next day, that hee might in the night
time have compassed his purpose. For
they thought (the same night) to have
<PB N="52" REF="35"/>
spoiled the Citie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The wic∣ked and bloody in∣tent of the Rebels in the night time.</NOTE> the King being first
slaine, and the great Lords that were a∣bout
him: then to have burnt the City,
by setting fire in foure parts thereof.
But God that resisteth the proud, did
suddenly disappoint him. For whereas
the forme of peace was written in three
several Charters, and thrice sent to him:
none of them could please him. Where∣fore
at length,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King sendeth Sir <HI>Iohn Newton</HI> to <HI>Wat Tylar</HI> about his owne de∣mands.</NOTE> the King sent to him one
of his Knights, named Sir <HI>Iohn Newton,</HI>
not so much to command, as to intreat
him (for his pride was well enough
knowne) to come and talke with him,
about his owne demands, to have them
put into his Charter: of which demands
I will set downe one, that it may plain∣ly
appeare, how contrary to reason all
the rest were.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">One of <HI>Wat Tylars</HI> arrogant demands made to the King.</NOTE> he would have a Commission
to behead all Lawyers, Escheators, and
others whatsoever, that were learned in
the Law, or communicated with the
Law, by reason of their office. For hee
had conceived in his mind, that this be∣ing
brought to passe, all things after∣ward
should bee ordered, according to
the fancy of the Common people. And
indeed it was said, that he had (but the
day before) made his vaunt, putting his
hand to his own lips:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A hold brag of a Rebell.</NOTE> that before foure
daies came to an end, all the Lawes of
<HI>England</HI> shuld proceed from his mouth.
When Sir <HI>Iohn Newton</HI> was in hand
with him for dispatch, he answered with
indignation: If thou art so hasty, thou
maist get thee to thy Master, for I will
come when it pleaseth mee. Notwith∣standing,
he followed on horsebacke a
slow pace: and by the way,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iohn Tickle</HI> the Doubb∣let maker his com∣ming to <HI>Wat Tylar,</HI> and what answer he made him.</NOTE> there came
to him a Doublet maker, who had
brought to the Commons threescore
Doublers, which they bought and wore,
and hee demanded thirty Markes for
them, but could have no payment, <HI>Wat
Tylar</HI> ansered him, saying, Friend, ap∣pease
thy selfe, thou shalt be well pay∣ed
before this day be ended: keep thee
neere to me, I will be thy Creditor.</P>
<P>Setting spurs to his horse, he depar∣ted
from his company,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Wat Tylar</HI> his com∣ming to the King, and his au∣dacious words to him.</NOTE> and came so
neere to the King, that his horse had
touched the crooper of the Kings horse,
and the first words he spake, were these:
Sir King, seest thou all yonder people?
Yea truely, quoth the King, wherefore
saist thou so? Because (said he) they be
all at my commandement, and have
sworne to mee their faith and truth, to
doe all that I will have them. In good
time, replyed the King, I beleeve it well.
Then said <HI>Wat Tylar,</HI> beleevest thou, King
that these people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A lamen∣table case when a King should bee in such di∣stresse.</NOTE> and as many moe as
be in <HI>London,</HI> at my command, will de∣part
from thee thus, without having thy
Letters? No, said the King, yee shall
have them, they bee ordained for you,
and shall bee delivered to every one of
them.</P>
<P>At these words, <HI>Wat Tylar</HI> seeing the
Knight Sir <HI>Iohn Newton</HI> neere to him
on horsebacke, bearing the Kings sword,
was offended, and said,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Wat Tylars</HI> words to Sir <HI>Iohn Newton</HI> who did heare the Kings sword.</NOTE> It had become
him better to be on foot inhis presence.
The Knight (not having forgot his old
accustomed manhood) answered, That
it was no harme, seeing himselfe was
also on horsebacke. Which words so
offended <HI>Wat,</HI> that he drew his Dagger,
and offered to strike the Knight, calling
him Traitor. The Knight answered, that
he lied, and drew his Dagger likewise.
<HI>Wat Tylar,</HI> not suffering such an indigni∣ty
to be done him, and before his rustick
companions, made as if he would have
run upon the Knight.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Knight comman∣ded to a∣light on foot be∣fore the Rebell.</NOTE> The King there∣fore,
seeing the Knight in danger, to as∣swage
the rigor of <HI>Wat</HI> for the time,
commanded the Knight to alight on
foot, and to deliver his Dagger to <HI>Wat
Tylar.</HI> But when his proud mind could
not bee so pacified, but hee would also
have his Sword: the Knight answered,
It was the kings sword, and (quoth he)
thou art not worthy to have it, nor durst
thou aske it of me, if here were no more
but thou and I. By my faith, said <HI>Wat
Tylar,</HI> I shall never eat, untill I have thy
head, and would have run in upon the
Knight.</P>
<P>At that very instant came to the King
<HI>William Walworth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The com∣ming of <HI>William Walworth</HI> L. Maior of <HI>London</HI> to checking and his worthy words to him.</NOTE> Lord Maior of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
a bold, couragious and brave min∣ded
man, with many Knights and
Squires to assist the King, and hee said;
My Liege, it were a great shame, and
such as never had before been heard of,
if in that presence, they should permit
a Noble knight to be shamefully mur∣thered,
and before the face of their So∣veraigne:
wherefore hee ought to bee
rescued, and <HI>Tylar</HI> the Rebell to be ar∣arrested.
<PB N="53" REF="35"/>
Which words being heard,
the king, although he were but of ten∣der
yeers, taking boldnesse and courage
to him, commanded the Maior of <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
to lay hand upon him. The Maior,
being a man of an incomparable spirit
and boldnes, without any further delay
or doubting, straight arrested him with
his Mace upon the head,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>William Walworth</HI> Lord Mai∣or of <HI>Lond.</HI> arrested <HI>VVat Tylar</HI> and felled him to the ground.</NOTE> and in such
sort, that he fell downe at the feet of his
horse. By and by, they which attended
on the king, environed him round about,
whereby he was not seene of his compa∣nie.
And an Esquire of the Kings, cal∣led
<HI>Iohn Cavendish,</HI> alighted from his
horse, and thrust his Sword into <HI>Wat Ty∣lars</HI>
belly: albeit more opinions do hold,
that the Maior did it with his Dagger,
and many beside did thrust him in, in
many places of his body, and then drew
him from among the people,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>VVat Tylar</HI> the Rebell slaine in <HI>Smithfield.</HI></NOTE> into the
Hospitall of Saint <HI>Bartholomew.</HI> Which
when the Commons perceived, they
cryed out, that their Captaine was trai∣terously
slaine, heartning one another to
fight, and to revenge his death, bending
their Bowes. But the King rode to them,
saying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The kings kinde words to the rude multitude</NOTE> What a worke is this, my men?
What meane you to doe? Will you
shoot at your king? Be not quarrellous,
or sorry for the death of a Traytor and
Ribald: I am your king, I will be your
Captaine and Leader: follow me into
the Field, there to have whatsoever you
will require.</P>
<P>This the king did, lest the Commons,
being bitterly bent in minde, should set
fire on the houses in <HI>Smithfield,</HI> where
their Captain was slaine. They therfore
followed him into the open Field,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They fol∣lowed the King into the field.</NOTE> and
the Souldiers that were with him, not
knowing as yet, whether they would kill
the king, or be in rest, and depart home
with the kings Charter. In the meane
while, worthy <HI>Walworth,</HI> the (for ever)
famous Maior of <HI>London,</HI> to second his
first peece of service, that fell out to so
good purpose, onely with one servant,
riding speedily into the Citie, began to
cry, You good Citizens, come to helpe
your king,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another worthy a∣ction per∣formed by the Lord Maior.</NOTE> that is in doubt to be murde∣red,
and succour me your Maior, that
am in the like danger: Or if you will
not succour me, yet leave not the king

this, in whose hearts the love of the
king was ingrafted, suddenly, and very
seemely prepared,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Noble and loyall forwardnesse in true-hear∣ted Citi∣zens, for the succor of their king, be∣ing in great di∣stresse.</NOTE> (to the number of a
thousand) they tarried in the streets,
for some one of the knights to lead them
(with the Lord Maior) to the king. And
by good fortune, Sir <HI>Robert Knowles,</HI> a
Freeman of the Citie, came in the very
instant, whom they all required to bee
their Leader. Hee gladly undertooke
part of them; and <HI>Perducas Dalbert,</HI> the
Lord Maior, and some other knights,
led on the rest to the kings presence. The
king, and all that were with him, rejoy∣cing
not a little at the unhoped for com∣ming
of these brave armed Citizens,
suddenly compassed the whole multi∣tude
of the Commons.</P>
<P>There might a man have seene a won∣derfull
change of Gods right hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A wonder∣full altera∣tiō among the Rebels</NOTE> how
the Commons did now throw downe
their weapons, and fall to the ground,
beseeching pardon; who lately before
did glory that they had the kings life in
their power; and now were glad to
hide themselves in caves, ditches, corne∣fields,
&amp;c. The knights therefore, desi∣rous
to be revenged, besought the king
to permit them to take off the heads of
and hundred or two ofthem.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great wis∣dome and discretion in the king being so yong.</NOTE> But the king
would not condiscend to their request,
but commanded the Charter which
they had demanded, written and sealed,
to be delivered to them for the time, to
avoid any more mischiefe: As knowing
well, that <HI>Essex</HI> was not yet pacified,
nor <HI>Kent</HI> stayed, the Commons and Ru∣sticks
of which Countries were ready to
rise again, if he did not satisfie them the
sooner. The Commons having got the
Charter, departed homeward, and the
rude people being disperted and gone,
the king called for his valiant Maior of
<HI>Lond. W. Walworth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>VV VVal∣worth,</HI> L. Maior of <HI>London</HI> knighted in the field and other Aldermen with him.</NOTE> whom (with great ho∣nour)
he knighted there in the field, and

like he did to <HI>Nicholas Brember, Ioh. Phil∣pot,
Robert Lawnd, Iohn Standish, Nicho∣las
Twiford,</HI> and <HI>Adam Frances,</HI> Alder∣men.
Afterward, the king, with his lords
and his company, orderly entred into
the Citie of <HI>London</HI> with great joy, and
went to his royal Mother, who was lod∣ged
in the <HI>Tower Royall,</HI> called then the
Queenes Wardrobe, and there shee
had remained two dayes and two

<PB N="54" REF="36"/>
But when shee saw the king her sonne,
she was highly comforted, and said, Ah

suffered for you this day!<NOTE PLACE="marg">The com∣fortable words of the King to his mo∣ther.</NOTE> The king an∣swered,

<P>And whereas it hath been farre spred
abroad by vulgar opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Concer∣ning vul∣gar mista∣king the Captaines name of the Rebels</NOTE> that the Re∣bell
smitten downe so manfully by Sir
<HI>William Walworth,</HI> the then worthy Lord
Maior of <HI>London,</HI> was named <HI>Iack Straw,</HI>
and not <HI>Wat Tylar:</HI> I thought good to
reconcile this rash conceived doubt, by
such testimony as I find in ancient and
good Records. The principall Leaders
and Captaines of the Commons, were
<HI>Wat Tylar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The name of the chiefe Captaines and ring∣leaders in the rebel∣lion.</NOTE> as the first man that tooke
himselfe to be offended. The second,
was <HI>Iohn</HI> or <HI>Iack Straw:</HI> the third, was
<HI>Iohn Kirkby:</HI> the fourth, <HI>Allen Thredder:</HI>
the fifth, <HI>Thomas Scot:</HI> the sixth, <HI>Ralfe
Rugge.</HI> These and many other were Lea∣ders
of the <HI>Kentish</HI> and <HI>Essex</HI> men. At
<HI>Mildenhall</HI> and <HI>Burie</HI> in <HI>Suffolke,</HI> was
<HI>Robert Westbrome,</HI> that made himselfe a
king; and was most famous, next to
<HI>Iohn Wrawe,</HI> who being a Priest, could
not set Crowne upon Crowne: but
left the name of king and Crowne to the
same <HI>Robert.</HI> At <HI>Norwich, Iohn Litester</HI>
a Dyer, exercised the name and power
of a king, till he was taken and hanged
for his paines. Thus dangerously had
this Rebellion dispersed it selfe abroad.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The rebel∣lion had extended it selfe in∣to many places.</NOTE>
But the happy and prosperous successe
at <HI>London,</HI> with other good care for them
further off, gave a gracious issue to all
in the end. After the death of <HI>Wat Tylar,</HI>
and <HI>Iack Straw</HI> being taken, with divers
other, as chiefe actors in this monstrous
disorder: the fore-named Lord Mayor
sate in judgement upon the offenders,
and pronounced the sentence of death
upon them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lord Maior sate in judge∣ment on the Re∣bels, and his words that he u∣sed to <HI>Iack Straw.</HI></NOTE> At which time, the Lord
Maior spake openly to him thus: <HI>Iohn</HI>
(quoth he) behold, thy death is at hand
without all doubt, and there is no way
through which thou mayst hope to e∣scape:
wherefore, for thy soules health,
without making any lye, tell us what
you purposed to have done among you,
and to what end you did assemble the
Commons. When hee had stayed a
while, as doubtfull what to say, the
Maior began thus againe to him: Sure∣ly
thou knowest, <HI>Iohn,</HI> that the thing
which I demand of thee, if thou doe it
truely, it will redound to thy soules
health, &amp;c. He therefore, animated by
the Lord Maiors good words, began as
followeth:</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Confession of Iack Straw, to the
Lord Maior of London, before
his death.</HEAD>
<P>NOw it booteth not to lye, neither is
it lawfull to utter any untruth:
especially, understanding that my
Soule is to suffer more straiter torments if I
should so doe. And because I hope for two
commodities by speaking the truth: first,
that what I shall speake, may profit the Com∣mon-wealth:
and secondly, after my death,
I trust by your suffrages to be succoured, ac∣cording
to your promises, which is to pray
for me: I will speake faithfully, and with∣out
any deceit.</P>
<P>At the same time as wee were assembled
upon <HI>Black-heath,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">What they intended to doe at <HI>Black heath.</HI></NOTE> and had sent to the King
to come unto us: our purpose was, to have
slaine all such Knights, Squires and Gen∣tlemen,

thither upon him: And as for the
King, we would have kept him among us,
to the end that the people might more boldly
have repaired to us: sith they would have
thought, that whatsoever we did, the same
had beene done by his authority. Finally,
when we had gotten power enough, that wee
needed not to feare any force which might be
made against us, we would have slaine all
such Noblemen as might either have given
counsell, or made any resistance against us:
especially, we would have slaine the Knights

Onely Friers <HI>Mendicants</HI> wee would have
spared, that might have sufficed for Mini∣stration
of the Sacraments.</P>
<P>When we had made a riddance of all those,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lawes de∣vised by thēselves.</NOTE>
we would have devised Lawes, according to
which Lawes the subjects of the Realme
should have lived. For we would have cre∣ated
Kings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Creation of kings a∣mong thē.</NOTE> as <HI>Wat Tylar</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> and
other in other Countries. But because this
our purpose was disappointed by the Arch∣bishop
of <HI>Canturbury,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their ma∣lice to the Archbi∣shop.</NOTE> that would not per∣mit
the King to come to us: wee sought by
all meanes to dispatch him out the way, as
at length we did. Moreover, the same eve∣ning
that <HI>Wat Tylar</HI> was kild, wee were
determined (having the greatest part of the
Commons of the City bent to joyne with us)
to have set fire in foure corners of the Citie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their in∣tent to burue <HI>Lon∣don.</HI></NOTE>

And these stones I have seene laid in the

<P>This Gate and tower was at the first

This said tower beeing taken

the Earles of <HI>March</HI> and of <HI>Warwicke,</HI>
with a great power of men, (but few of

they were of the Citizens joyfully re∣ceived;
and upon the third of <HI>March,</HI> be∣ing
Sunday, the said Earle caused his
people to be mustred in S. <HI>Iohns</HI> field:
where, unto that host was shewed and
proclaimed, certaine Articles &amp; points,
wherein King <HI>Henry,</HI> as they said, had
offended, and thereupon it was deman∣ded
of the said people, whether the said
<HI>Henry</HI> was worthy to raingne as King any
longer, or not: wherunto the people cry∣ed,
nay. Then it was asked of them, whe∣ther
they would have the E.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Edward</HI> the 4 elected in S. <HI>Iohns</HI> field.</NOTE> of <HI>March</HI>
for their King: and they cryed, yea, yea.
Whereupon certaine Captaines were
appointed to beare report thereof to the
said Earle of <HI>March,</HI> then being lodged
at his Castle of <HI>Baynard.</HI> Whereof when
the Earle was by them advertised, he
thanked God, and them for their electi∣on:
notwithstanding, he shewed some
countenance of insufficiency in him, to
occupie so great a charge, till by exhor∣tation
of the Archbishop of <HI>Canturbury,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Edward</HI> the 4. took on him the Crownein <HI>Baynards Castle.</HI></NOTE>
the Bishop of <HI>Excest.</HI> and certain Noble∣men,

sung. Then was he with great Royalty
conveyed to <HI>Westminster,</HI> and there in the

<P><PB N="60" REF="39"/>
The forenamed <HI>Hawkins</HI> came (up∣on

requesting him to lend him a thousand

use of Queen <HI>Margaret,</HI> hee answered;
he had no currant wares, whereof a∣ny
shift might bee made, without
too much losse, and therefore required
<HI>Hawkins</HI> to move him no further, for he
intended not to deale therewithall. Yet
the said <HI>Hawkins</HI> requested but one
hundred pounds at length, and went a∣way
without it, or the value of one pen∣ny,
and never after came again to move
him; which rested so for two or 3. yeere
after, till the said <HI>Hawkins</HI> was com∣mitted
to the Tower; and brought at

revealed many things: and among the
rest, the motion, which hee had made

whereof, the said Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> was trou∣bled,
as you have heard, and a Iury, by

<P>To this place was the said Sir <HI>Thomas</HI>

principal Churches, which
had famous Schooles, ei∣ther
by priviledge and ancient dignitie,
or by fauour of some particular persons, as
of Doctors, which were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ceounted notable
and renowned, for knowledge in Philosophie.
And there were other inferior Schools also.</P>
<P>Vpon Festivall dayes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Solemne meetings and dispu∣ting of scholars Logically and de∣monstra∣tively.</NOTE> the Masters made
solemne meetings in the Churches, where
their Schollers disputed Logically and de∣monstratively:
some bringing Enthimems,
other, perfect Syllogismes: some disputed
for shew; others to trace out the truth; and
cunning Sophisters were brave scholars,
when they flowed with words. Others used
fallacies: Rhetoricians spake aptly to per∣swade,
observing the precepts of Art, and
omitting nothing that might serve their pur∣pose.
The Boyes of divers Schooles did cap
or pot verses, and contended of the princi∣ples
of Grammar.</P>
<P>There were some,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grammar schooles &amp; scholers their exer∣cises.</NOTE> which (on the other
side) with Epigrams and Rimes, nipping
and quipping their fellowes, and the faults
of others, though suppressing their names,
moved thereby much laughter among their
Auditors.</P>
<P>Hitherto <HI>Fitzstephen,</HI> for schooles and
scholars, and for their exercise in the
Citie in his dayes,: sithence the which
time, as to me it seemeth, by increase of
Colledges of students in the Vaiversi∣ties
of <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge,</HI> the fre∣quenting
of schooles, and exercises of
scholars in the Citie, as had beene ac∣customed,
very much decreased.</P>
<P>The three principall Churches which
had these famous shooles by priviled∣ges,
must needs be the cathedral Church
of S. <HI>Paul</HI> for one: seeing that by a gene∣rall
Councell,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat. Paris.</HI> Every Ca∣thedrall Church had his schoole for poore scholars.</NOTE> <HI>holden in the yeere 1176.
at <HI>Rome,</HI> in the Patriarchie of</HI> Laterane,
<HI>it was decreed, that every Cathedrall
Church should have his schoolemaster,
to teach poore schollers, and others, as
had bin accustomed, and that no man
should take any reward for licence to
teach. The second, as most ancient, may
seeme to have beene the Monasterie of
S.</HI> Peters <HI>at</HI> Westminster, <HI>whereof</HI> Ingul∣phus,
<HI>Abbot of</HI> Crowland, <HI>in the reigne
of</HI> William <HI>the Conqueror, writeth thus:
1 Jngulphus,</HI> an humble servant of God,
borne of English parents, in the most beau∣tifull
Citie of <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Free schoole at <HI>Westminster</HI> in the reigne of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor.</NOTE> for to attaine to

<HI>the Confessor:</HI> I have seene <HI>(faith

met the Queene, she would oppose me tou∣ching
my learning and lesson. And falling
from Grammar to Logicke, wherein she had
some knowledge, she would subtilly conclude
an Argument with me. And by her hand∣maiden
give me three or foure peeces of mo∣ney,
and send mee unto the Palace, where I
should receive some victuals, and then bee
dismissed.</P>
<P>The third Schoole seemeth to have
beene in the Monastery of S. <HI>Saviour,</HI> at
<HI>Bermondsey</HI> in <HI>Southwarke.</HI> For other
Priories, as of Saint <HI>Iohn</HI> by <HI>Smithfield,</HI>
Saint <HI>Bartholomew</HI> in <HI>Smithfield,</HI> Saint
<HI>Mary Overie</HI> in <HI>Southwarke,</HI> and that of
the Holy <HI>Trinity</HI> by <HI>Ealdgate,</HI> were all

raised since them, in the reignes of <HI>Hen∣ry</HI>
the 3. <HI>Edward</HI> the 1, 2, and 3. &amp;c. All
which houses had their Schools, though
not so famous as these first named.</P>
<P>But touching Schooles more lately
advanced in this Citie, I read, that King
<HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, having suppressed the
Priories Aliens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Priories Aliens.</NOTE> whereof some were a∣bout
<HI>London,</HI> namely, <HI>Our Lady of Roun∣civall</HI>

besides other that are now

there is no monument remaining, more
than <HI>Rouncivall,</HI> converted to a Brother∣hood,
which continued till the reigne
of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, or <HI>Edward</HI> the 6.
This, I say, and other of their Schooles,
being broken up and ceased, King <HI>Henry</HI>
the 6. in the 24. of his reigne,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Henry</HI> the sixth ap∣pointed Grammar Schooles.</NOTE> by Pa∣tent
appointed, that there should be in

Bow,</HI> in <HI>Cheap,</HI> S. <HI>Dunstans</HI> in the west,
and S. <HI>Anthonies.</HI> And in the next yeere,
to wit, 1394. the said King ordained
by Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grammar schooles appointed by Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> that foure other Gram∣mer-Schooles
should be erected, to wit,

as divers Schooles, by suppressing of
religious houses (whereof they were
members in the reigne of <HI>Henry</HI> the
eighth, have beene decayed: so againe
have some others beene newly erected
and founded for them.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pauls</HI> Schoole new buil∣ded.</NOTE> As namely, <HI>Pauls</HI>
schoole, in place of an old ruined house,
was builded in most ample manner, and
largely endowed in the yeere 1512. by
<HI>Iohn Collet,</HI> Doctor of Divinity, and
Deane of <HI>Pauls,</HI> for 153. poore mens
children: for which there was ordained
a Master, Submaster or Vsher, and a
Chaplaine.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Free schools in <HI>Christs Ho∣spitall.</HI></NOTE> Againe, in the yeere 1553.
after the erection of Christs Hospitall,
in the late dissolved house of the <HI>Gray
Friers,</HI> a great number of poore children
being taken in, a schoole was also ordai∣ned
there, at the Citizens charges.</P>
<P>Also in the yeere 1561. the Mer∣chant
Taylors of <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Free schooles founded by the Merchant Taylors.</NOTE> founded one
notable free Grammar-schoole, in the
Parish of Saint <HI>Laurence Poultney,</HI> by
<HI>Candle-weeke</HI> street; <HI>Richard Hils,</HI> late
Master of that Company, having given
500. pound toward the purchase of an
House, called the Mannor of the <HI>Rose,</HI>
sometime the Duke of <HI>Buckinghams,</HI>
wherein the schoole is kept.</P>
<P>As for the meeting of Schoolemasters
on festivall dayes, at festivall Churches,
and the disputing of their schollers Lo∣gically,
&amp;c. whereof I have before spo∣ken,
the same was long since disconti∣nued.
But the arguing of schoole-boies
about the principles of Grammar, hath
beene continued even till our time: for
I my selfe (in my youth) have yeerely
seene, on the Eve of Saint <HI>Bartholomew</HI>
the Apostle, the schollers of divers
Grammar-schooles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scholars disputed in S. <HI>Bar∣tholomews</HI> Church∣yard.</NOTE> repaire unto the
Churchyard of Saint <HI>Bartholomew</HI> the
Priory in <HI>Smithfield,</HI> where, upon a banke
boorded about under a Tree, some one
scholar hath stepped up, and there hath
apposed and answered, till he were by
some better scholler overcome and
put downe. And then the overcommer
taking the place, did like as the first:
and in the end, the best opposers and
answerers had rewards, which I obser∣ved
not: but it made both good schoole∣masters,
and also good scholars (dili∣gently
against such times) to prepare
themselves for the obtaining of this
Garland.</P>
<P>I remember there repaired to these ex∣ercises,
(amongst others) the Masters
and scholars of the free schooles of S.
<HI>Pauls</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> of Saint <HI>Peters</HI> at
<PB N="65" REF="41"/>
<HI>Westminster,</HI> of Saint <HI>Thomas Acons</HI> Ho∣spital,
and of Saint <HI>Anthonies</HI> Hospitall:
whereof the last named, commonly pre∣sented
the best Scholers, and had the
prize in those dayes.</P>
<P>This Priorie of Saint <HI>Bartholomew</HI> be∣ing
surrendred to <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth,
those disputations of Scholers in that
place surceased,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disputati∣on of scholars in <HI>Christs Hospitall.</HI></NOTE> and was againe, onely
for a yeere or twaine, in the reigne of
<HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, revived in the Cloister
of <HI>Christs Hospitall,</HI> where the best Scho∣lers,
(then still of S. <HI>Anthonies</HI> Schoole)
were rewarded with Bowes and Ar∣rowes
of silver, given to them by Sir
<HI>Martin Bowes,</HI> Goldsmith.</P>
<P>Neverthelesse, howsoever the incou∣ragement
failed, the Scholers of <HI>Pauls,</HI>
meeting with them of Saint <HI>Anthonies,</HI>
would call them Saint <HI>Anthonies</HI> Pigs,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Anthonies</HI> Pigs.</NOTE>
and they againe would call the other
Pigeons of <HI>Pauls;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pigeons of <HI>Pauls.</HI></NOTE> because many Pige∣ons
were bred in <HI>Pauls</HI> Church, and S.
<HI>Anthonie</HI> was alwaies figured with a
Pig following him: and mindfull of the
former usage, did for a long season, dis∣orderly
in the open street, provoke one
another, with <HI>Salve tu quoque, placet tibi
mecum disputare? placet.</HI> And so procee∣ding
from this to questions in Gram∣mar,
they usually fell from words to
blowes, with their fatchels full of books,
many times in great heaps, that they
troubled the streets and passengers: so
that finally they were restrained with
the decay of Saint <HI>Anthonies</HI> Schoole.</P>
<P>Out of this Schoole have sprung di∣vers
famous persons, whereof although
time hath buried the names of many,
yet in mine owne remembrance may be
numbred these following: Sir <HI>Thomas
Moore,</HI> Knight, Lord Chancellour of

the yeere, men might have meat, roast, sod,

orfryed fish, flesh, fowles, fit for rich and
poore. If any come suddenly to any Citi∣zen
from afarre, weary, and not willing to
tarry till the meat be bought, and dressed,
while the servant bringeth water for his
masters hands, and fetcheth bread, he shall
have immediately (from the Rivers side)
all viands whatsoever hee desireth, What
multitude soever, either of Souldiers, or
strangers doe come to the Citie, whatsoever
houre, day or night, according to their plea∣sures,
may refresh themselves, and they
which delight in delicatenesse, may bee sa∣tisfied
with as delicate dishes there, as may
be found elsewhere. And this Cookes row
is very necessary to the Citie: and accor∣ding
to <HI>Plato</HI> in <HI>Gorgius;</HI> next to Physick
is the office of Cookes, as part of a City.</P>
<P>Without one of the Gates is a plaine field,
both in name and deed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Smithfield for a plain smooth ground, is called smeth and smothie.</NOTE> where every Fry∣day,
unlesse it bee a solemne bidden Holy∣day,
is a notable shew of horses to bee sold,
Earles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Market for horses and other cat∣tell.</NOTE> Barons, Knights and Citizens re∣paire

there may you have not able young horses not
yet brokene may you have strong steeds, well

regard for pace, and swiftnesse. The boyes
which ride these horses, sometime two, some∣time
three, doe runne races for wagers,
with a desire of praise, or hope of victory. In

this City is ancienter than <HI>Rome,</HI>
built by the ancient <HI>Troians</HI> and by <HI>Brute,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">This City divided in∣to Wards more than 400. yeers since, and also had then both Aldermen and She∣riffes.</NOTE>
before that was built by <HI>Romulus</HI> and
<HI>Remus;</HI> and therefore useth the ancient
customes of <HI>Rome.</HI> This Citie, even as
<HI>Rome,</HI> is divided into Wards. It hath
yeerely Shriffes, in stead of Consuls. It
hath the diginity of Senators, in Aldermen.
It hath under-Officers, Common Sewers,
and Conducts in streets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Customes of <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> according to the
quality of causes. It hath generall Courts
and assemblies upon appointed daies. I doe
not thinke that there is any City, wherein
are better customes, in frequenting the
Churches, in serving God, in keeping Ho∣ly-daies,
in giving almes, in entertaining
strangers, in solemnizing Marriages, in
furnishing banquets, celebrating funerals,
and burying dead bodies.</P>
<P>The only plagues of <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Casualties of fires when houses were covered with church.</NOTE> is immode∣rate
quaffing among the foolish sort, and of∣ten
casualties by fire. Most part of the Bi∣shops,
Abbots, and great Lords of the land,
have houses there, whereunto they resort and
bestow much, when they are called to Parli∣ament
by the King, or to counsell by their
Metropolitane, or otherwise by their pri∣vate
businesse.</P>
<P>Thus firre <HI>Fitzstephen,</HI> of the estate

his owne knowlege) to be true, though
for the Antiquity of the Citie, he tooke
the common opinion. Also, that this
Citie was (in his time, and before) divi∣ded
into Wards; had yeerely Sheriffes
and Aldermen, generall Courts and as∣semblies,
and such like notes by him set
downe, in commendation of the Citi∣zens,
whereof there is no question. He
wrote likewise of his owne experience,
as being borne and brought up amongst
them.</P>
<P>And to confirme his opinion, concer∣ning
Merchandizes then hither trans∣ported,
whereof haply may be some ar∣gument;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tho. Clifford.</NOTE> <HI>Thomas Clifford</HI> (before <HI>Fitz∣stephens</HI>

the confessor, saith to this effect: <HI>King</HI>
Edward, <HI>intending to make his Sepulchre
at</HI> Westminster, <HI>for that it was neere to
the famous Citie of</HI> London, <HI>and the River
of</HI> Thames, <HI>which brought in all kinde of

<HI>Stephen,</HI> calleth this <HI>A Noble Citie, full
of wealthy Citizens, frequented with the
trade of Merchandizes from all parts of the
world.</HI> Also I read in divers Records, that
(in old time) <HI>No woad was stowed or har∣boured
in this Citie, but all was presently
seld in the Ships, except by licence purcha∣sed
of the Sheriffes;</HI> till of more later
time, to wit in the yeere 1236. <HI>Andrew
Bokerell,</HI> being Maior, by assent of the
principall Citizens, the Merchants of
<HI>Amiens, Nele</HI> and <HI>Corby,</HI> purchased Let∣ters
ensealed with the common seale of
the Citie, that they, when they came,
might harborow their Woads, and
therefore should give the Maior every
yeere 50. Markes starling. And the
same yeere they gave an hundred pound
toward conveying of water from <HI>Tyborn</HI>
to this Citie, as already hath beene re∣lated.</P>
<P>Also the Merchants of <HI>Normandy</HI>
made fine, for licence to harbour their
Woads, till it was otherwise provided,
in the yeere 1263. <HI>Thomas Fitzthomas</HI>
being Maior, &amp;c. Which proveth, that
then (as before) they were here, among
other Nations, priviledged.</P>
<P><HI>It followeth in</HI> Fitzstephen;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plagues of <HI>London,</HI> im∣moderate quaffing, and casualties by fire.</NOTE> That the
plagues of <HI>London</HI> (in that time) were im∣moderate
quaffing among fooles, and often
casualties by fire.</P>
<P>For the first, to wit, of quaffing, it
continueth still as afore, or rather, is
mightily increased, though greatly qual∣med
among the poorer sort, not of any
holy abstinency, but of meere necessity:
Ale and Beere being small, and Wines
in price above their reach.</P>
<P>As for prevention of casualties by fire,
the houses in this Citie (being then
builded all of timber, and covered with
thatch of straw or reed;)<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. Constit.</NOTE> it was long
since thought good policie in our fore-father,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. Horne.</NOTE> wisely to provide;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. Clarkē∣well.</NOTE> namely, in
the yeere of Christ, 1189. the first of
<HI>Richard</HI> the first, <HI>Henry Fitzalwine,</HI> (be∣ing
then Maior) that all men in this Ci∣tie
should build their houses of stone up
to a certaine height, and to cover them
with slate or baked tile. Since which
time, thankes bee given to God, there
hath not hapned the like often consu∣ming
fire in this Citie, as before.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="44"/>
But now in our time, insteed of these
enormities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Purpre∣stur in and about this City.</NOTE> others are come in place, no
lesse meet to be reformed, namely, Pur∣prestures,
or encrochments on the high∣wayes,
lanes, and common grounds, in
and about this City. Whereof a lear∣ned
Gentleman,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Paucns.</NOTE> a grave Citizen,
hath (not many yeeres since) written
and exhibited a Book to the Maior and
communalty, which Booke, whether
the same hath been by them read, and
diligently considered upon, I know not;
but sure I am, nothing is reformed since
concerning this matter.</P>
<P>Then the number of Cars, Draies,
Carts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carts and Drayes not well governed in this City dange∣rous.</NOTE> and Coaches, more than hath
been accustomed, the streets and lanes
being streightned, must needs be dan∣gerous,
as daily experience proveth.</P>
<P>The Coach-man rides behinde the
horse tailes, lasheth them, and looketh
not behind him. The Dray-man sitteth
and sleepeth on his Dray, and letteth
his horse leade him home.<NOTE PLACE="marg">L. S. <HI>Mary Aborum.</HI></NOTE> I know, that
by the good Lawes and Customes of
this City, shod Carts are forbidden to
enter the same, except upon reasonable
causes, as service of the Prince, or such
like, they be tolerated. Also that the
fore-horse of every carriage should bee
led by hand: but these good orders are
not observed. Of old time, Coaches
were not known in this Iland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riding in <HI>Whirlicotes.</HI></NOTE> but Cha∣riots
or <HI>Whirlicotes,</HI> then so called, and
they onely used for Princes or great E∣states,
such as had their footmen about
them. And for example to note, I
reade that <HI>Richard</HI> the second being
threatned by the Rebels of <HI>Kent,</HI> rode
from the Tower of <HI>London</HI> to the <HI>Miles-end,</HI>
and with him, his Mother, because
she was sicke and weake, in a <HI>Whirlicote,</HI>
the Earles of <HI>Buckingham, Kent, War∣wicke,</HI>
and <HI>Oxford,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Percie,</HI>
Sir <HI>Robert Knowles,</HI> the Maior of <HI>London,</HI>
Sir <HI>Aubery de Vere</HI> that bare the Kings
sword, with other Knights and Esquiers
attending on horsebacke. It followed
in the next yeere, that the said King
<HI>Richard,</HI> who took to wife <HI>Anne,</HI> daugh∣ter
to the King of <HI>Boheme,</HI> that then was,
first brought hither the riding upon side
Saddles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riding on side Sad∣dles, that were wont to ride a stride.</NOTE> and so was the riding in those
<HI>Whirlicotes</HI> and Chariots forsken; ex∣cept
at Coronations and such like spe∣ctacles.
But now of late yeeres, the use
of Coaches, brought out of <HI>Germany,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Riding in Coaches.</NOTE> is
taken up, and made so common, as there
is neither distinction of time, nor diffe∣rence
of persons observed: for the
world runnes on wheeles with many,
whose Parents were glad to goe on
foot.</P>
<P>Last of all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">W. Fitstephen.</NOTE> mine Author, in this
Chapter hath these words: <HI>Most part
of the Bishops, Abbots, and great Lords of
the land, as if they were Citizens and Free∣men
of</HI> Lond. <HI>had many faire houses to re∣sort
unto, and many rich &amp; wealthy Gentle∣men
spent their money there.</HI> And in ano∣ther
place, he hath these words: <HI>Every
Sunday in</HI> Lent, <HI>a fresh company of young
men comes into the fields on horsbacke,
and the best horsemen conduct the rest,
then march forth the Citizens Sonnes, and
other yong men with disarmed Launces and
Shields, and practise feats of Warre. Many
Courtiers likewise, and attendants on No∣blemen,
repaire to this exercise, and whilest
the hope of victory doth inflame their minds;
they doe shew good proofe, how serviceable
they would bee in Martiall affaires, &amp;c.</HI>
Againe he saith, <HI>This Citie, in the trou∣blesome
time of King</HI> Stephen, <HI>shewed at
a Muster 20000. armed horsemen, and
40000. footmen, serviceable for the Wars,
&amp;c.</HI> All which sayings of the said Au∣thor
well considered, doe plainly prove,
that in those dayes, the inhabitants and
repaireres to this City (of what este so∣ever,
spirituall or temporall) having

<HEAD>Of charitable Almes in old time given.</HEAD>
<P>THese, as all other of their times,
gave great reliefe to the poore.
I my self, in that declining time
of charity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Almes gi∣ven at the Lord <HI>Crom∣wels</HI> gate.</NOTE> have oft seene at the Lord
<HI>Cromwels</HI> gate in <HI>London,</HI> more than 200
persons, served twice every day with
bread, meat and drinke sufficient; for
he observed that ancient and charitable
custome, as all Prelates, Noblemen, or
men of honour and worship his pre∣decessours,
had done before him: wher∣of
somewhat to note for example: Ve∣nerable
<HI>Bede</HI> writeth; that Prelates of
his time, having peradventure but
woodden Churches, had (notwithstan∣ding)
on their boord at their meales,
one Almes dish, into the which was
carved some good portion of meat, out
of every other dish brought to their Ta∣ble,
all which was given to the poore,
besides the fragments left. Insomuch as
in a hard time, a poore Prelate wanting
victuals, hath caused his Almes dish, be∣ing
silver, to be divided amongst the
poore, therewith to shift as they could,
till God should send him better store.</P>
<P>Such a Prelate was <HI>Ethelwald,</HI> Bishop
of <HI>Winchester,</HI> in the reigne of King <HI>Ed∣gar,</HI>
about the yeere of Christ, 963. He
in a great famine, sold away all the sa∣cred

the almost starved people, saying: <HI>That
there was no reason that the senselesse Tem∣ples
of God should abound in riches, and
lively Temples of the Holy Ghost to lacke it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Walter de Suffilde,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Norwich,</HI>
was of the like minde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bishop of <HI>Norwich</HI> sold his plate.</NOTE> about the yeere

<P><HI>Robert Winchelsey,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Archbi∣shop of <HI>Canturbury</HI> his charity</NOTE> Archbishop of <HI>Can∣turbury,</HI>
about the yeere 1293. besides

that came to his gate, a loate of
bread sufficient for that day, and there
were usually every such almes day in
time of dearth, to the number of 5000.
and otherwise 4000 at the least. More,
hee used every great Feastivall day, to
give 150. pence to so many poore peo∣ple,
and sent daily meat, bread, and
drinke, to such as by age, or sicknes, were
not able to fetch his Almes, and did send
meat, money and apparell to such as he
thought needed it.</P>
<P>I reade in 1171. that <HI>Henry</HI> the se∣cond,

<P>More I finde recorded, that in the

6000. poore people should bee fed at

that upon Friday next after the <HI>Epipha∣nie,</HI>
they should cause to be fed in the

did weekely bestow for releefe of the

<P>To end the Orders and Customes in

all Noble persons, and other of honour

without grudging, beare their parts in

<P><PB N="77" REF="47"/>
Certaine of the Kings servants, be∣cause
the Court lay then at <HI>Westminster,</HI>
came,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The kings servants deriding the Citi∣zens, were fore bea∣tē, but the Citizens were fined by the King.</NOTE> as it were, in despight of the Ci∣tizens,
to that game, and giving re∣prochfull
names to the <HI>Londoners,</HI> which
for the dignity of the Citie, and the an∣cient
priviledge which they ought to
have enjoyed, were called Barons: the
said <HI>Londoners</HI> being wrongfully abused,
fell upon the Kings servants, and beat
them shrewdly, so that upon complaint
made to the King, he fined the Citie to
pay a thousand Markes. This exercise of
running at the Quinten, was practised
by the youthfull Citizens, aswel in sum∣mer
as in winter; namely, in the feast of
<HI>Christmas.</HI> I have seene a Quinten set
upon <HI>Cornhill,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Quinten upon <HI>Corn∣hill.</HI></NOTE> by the <HI>Leaden Hall,</HI> where
the attendants of the Lords of merry di∣sports
have runne, and made great pa∣stime:
for he that hit not the broad end
of the Quinten, was of all men laughed
to scorne; and he that hit it full, if hee
rode nor the faster, had a sound blow in
his necke with a bag full of sand, han∣ged
on the other end.</P>
<P>I have also in the Summer season,
seene some upon the River of <HI>Thames,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Running with staves on the <HI>Thames.</HI></NOTE>
rowed in Whirries, with staves in their

one or both overthrowne, and well
dowked.</P>
<P>On the Holy-dayes in Summer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leaping, dancing, shooting, wrestling.</NOTE> the

<P>And for defence and use of the Wea∣pon,
there is a speciall profession of men
that teach it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. Paris.</NOTE> I reade that in the yeere
1222. and the 6. of King <HI>Henry</HI> the 3. on
Saint <HI>Iames</HI> day, the Citizens of <HI>London</HI>
kept games of defence and wrestling,
neere to the Hospitall of <HI>Matilda,</HI> at S.
<HI>Giles</HI> in the field, where they got the ma∣stery
of the men of the Suburbs.</P>
<P>The Bailiffe of <HI>Westminster</HI> devising

<P>When they had played a while, the
Bailiffe, with the men of the Suburbs,
harnessed themselves treacherously, and
fell to such fighting, that the Citizens
(being sore wounded) were forced to
runne into the Citie, where they rung
the common Bell, and assembled the
Citizens in great number. When the
matter was declared, every man wished
to revenge the fact:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ad∣vice of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> L. Maior.</NOTE> but the Lord Mai∣or
of the Citie, being a wise and quiet

of <HI>Westminster</HI> in the matter, and if
he would promise to see amends made,
it was sufficient.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The bad counsel of <HI>Constantine Fitz Arnulit</HI> as bad fol∣lowed.</NOTE> But a certaine Citizen,
named <HI>Constantine Fitz Arnulit,</HI> willed,
that all the houses of the Abbot and Bai∣liffe

desperate words were no sooner spoken,
but the common people (as unadvised∣ly)
issued forth of the Citie without a∣ny
order, and fought a cruell battell,
<HI>Constantine</HI> pulling downe divers hou∣ses;
and the people (as praising <HI>Constan∣tine)</HI>
cryed; <HI>The joy of the Mountaine, the

<P>A few dayes after this tumult, the

to pacific the vprore, the Abbot got

<HI>Constantine,</HI> being constant in the sedi∣tion,

<P>Also in the yeere 1453. of a tumult
made against the Maior,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gamos of defence.</NOTE> at the wrest∣ling

made by the Citizens for disport of the

with divers other Lords.</P>
<P>In the first ranke did ride 48. in the

<P>After them came riding 48. Knights,

<P>Then followed one richly arrayed, like
an Emperour; and after him some di∣stance,
one stately tyred like a Pope,
who was followed by 24. Cardinals:
and after them eight or ten with blacke

Legates from some forraigne Princes.</P>
<P>These Maskers, after they had entred
the Mannor of <HI>Kennington,</HI> alighted
from their horses: and entred the Hall
on foot; which done, the Prince, his
Mother, and the Lords came out of the
chamber into the hall, whom the Mum∣mers
did salute: shewing by a paire of

with the yong Prince: which they so

handled, that the Prince did alwaies

<P>Then the Mummers set to the Prince

were, a Boule of gold, a Cup of gold,

did also winne. After which they were
feasted, and the Musicke sounded, the
Prince and Lords danced on the one

dance: which jollity being ended, they
were againe made to drinke, and then
departed in order as they came.</P>
<P>The like was to <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, in

his <HI>Christmas</HI> at <HI>Eltham,</HI> twelve Alder∣men
of <HI>London,</HI> and their sonnes, rode in
a mumming, and had great thanks.</P>
<P>Thus much for sportfull shewes in
Triumphes may suffice.</P>
<P>Now for sports and pastimes yeerely
used.</P>
<P>First, in the Feast of <HI>Christmas,</HI> there
was in the Kings house, wheresoever he
was lodged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord of Misrule at Christmas</NOTE> a Lord of Misrule, or Ma∣ster
of merry disports, and the like had
ye in the house of every Nobleman of
honour, or good worship, were he spi∣rituall
or temporall. Among the which,
The Maior of <HI>London,</HI> and either of the
Sheriffes had their severall Lords of
misrule, ever contending, without qua∣rell
or offence, who should make the ra∣rest
pastimes to delight the beholders.
These Lords beginning their rule at <HI>Al∣hallon</HI>
Eve, continued the same till the
mocrow after the Feast of the Purifica∣tion,
commonly called <HI>Candlemas</HI> day:
In all which space, there were fine and
subtill disguisings, Maskes and Mum∣meries,
with playing at Cards for coun∣ters,
nayles and points in every house,
more for pastime than for gaine.</P>
<P>Against the Feast of <HI>Christmas,</HI> every
mans house, as also their Parish Chur∣ches,
were decked with Holme, Ivie,
Bayes, and whatsoever the season of the
yeere affoorded to be greene: The con∣duits
and standards in the streets were
likewise garnished. Among the which,
I read, that in the yeere 1444. by tem∣pest
of thunder and lightning, on the
first of <HI>February</HI> at night,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tempests of light∣ning and thunder fi∣red <HI>Pauls</HI> steeple, o∣verthrew the stan∣dard at <HI>Leaden hall,</HI> and threw stones of the paye∣ment into mens houses.</NOTE> <HI>Pauls</HI> steeple
was fired, but with great labour quen∣ched:
and toward the morning of <HI>Can∣dlemas</HI>
day, at the Leaden Hall in <HI>Corn∣hill,</HI>
a Standard of tree being set up in
the midst of the payement, fast in the
ground, nayled full of Holme and Ivie,
for disport of <HI>Christmas</HI> to the people;
was torne up, and cast downe by the
malignant Spirit (as was thought) and
the stones of the payement all about,
were cast in the streets, and into divers
houses, so that the people were sore a∣gast
at the great tempests.</P>
<P>In the weeke before <HI>Easter,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Twisted trees <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et from the woods.</NOTE> had yee
great shewes made, for the fetching in
of a twisted Tree, or With, as they ter∣med
it, out of the woods, into the kings
house, and the like into every mans
house of Honour or Worship.</P>
<P>In the Moneth of <HI>May,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">May games</NOTE> namely on
<HI>May</HI> day in the morning, every man,
except impediment, would walke into
the sweet Meddowes and green woods,
there to rejoyce their spirits with the
beauty and savour of sweet Flowers, and
with the harmonie of Birdes, praising
God in their kinde. And for example
hereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Edward Hall.</NOTE> <HI>Edward Hall</HI> hath noted, that
King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, as in the third of
his reigne, and divers other yeeres, so
namely in the seventh of his reigne, on
<HI>May</HI> day in the morning, with Queene
<HI>Katharine</HI> his wife, accompanied with
many Lords and Ladies, rode a Maying
from <HI>Greenwich</HI> to the high ground of
<HI>Shooters-hill:</HI> where as they passed by
the way, they espyed a company of tall
Yeomen, clothed all in greene, with
greene hoods, and with bowes and ar∣rowes,
to the number of 200. One, be∣ing
their Chieftaine,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Robin Hood</HI> and his men shot before the King.</NOTE> was called <HI>Robin
Hood,</HI> who required the King and all his
company to stay and see his men shoot:
whereunto the King granting, <HI>Robin
Hood</HI> whistled, and all the 200. Archers
shot off, loosing all at once; and when
he whistled againe, they likewise shot a∣gaine:
their Arrowes whistled by craft
of the head, so that the noise was strange
and loud, which greatly delighted the
King, Queene, and their company.</P>
<P>Moreouer, this <HI>Robin Hood</HI> desired the
King and Queene, with their retinue,
to enter the greene Wood, where, in
Arbours made with boughes, and deckt
<PB N="80" REF="49"/>
with flowers, they were set and served
plentifully with venison and wine, by
<HI>Robin Hood</HI> and his meyny, to their
great contentment, and had other Pa∣geants
and Pastimes, as yee may read
in my said Author.</P>
<P>I find also, that in the month of <HI>May,</HI>
the Citizens of <HI>London</HI> (of all estates)
lightly in every Parish, or sometime
two or three Parishes joyning toge∣ther,
had their severall Maynings, and
did fetch in May-poles, with divers
warlike shewes, with good Archers,
Morice-dancers, and other devices for
pastime all the day long; and towards
the evening, they had stage-plaies, and
Bonefires in the streets.</P>
<P>Of these Mayings, we read in the reign
of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, that the Aldermen
and Sheriffes of <HI>London,</HI> being on <HI>May</HI>
day at the Bishop of <HI>Londons</HI> Wood in
the Parish of <HI>Stebunheath,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bishops Wood.</NOTE> and having

</LG>
<P>About the ninth yeere of the reigne
of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eight, a great he art∣burning
and malicious grudge grew a∣mongst
the <HI>Englishmen</HI> of the City of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
against strangers: and namely, the
Artificers found themselves much a∣grieved;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The num∣ber of strangers in <HI>London</HI> misliked.</NOTE> because such number of stran∣gers
were permitted, to resort hither
with their Wares, and to exercise Han∣dicrafts,
to the great hinderance and
impoverishing of the Kings Liege peo∣ple.
Which malice grew to such a point
that one <HI>Iohn Lincolne</HI> a Broker,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iohn Lincolne</HI> a Broker beginner of the in∣surrection</NOTE> busied
himselfe so farre in the matter, that a∣bout
<HI>Palme</HI> Sunday, or the fift of <HI>April,</HI>
he came to one Doctor <HI>Henry Standish,</HI>
with these words; Sir, I understand,
that you shall preach at the <HI>Spittle</HI> on
Munday in Easter-weeke, and so it is,
that <HI>English</HI> men, both Merchants and o∣ther,
are undone by stangers, who have
more liberty in this Land than they,
which is against reason, and also against
the Common-weale of this Realme: I
beseech you therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A bill of∣fered by <HI>Lincolne</HI> to Doctor <HI>Standish.</HI></NOTE> to declare this in
your sermon, and in so doing, you shall
deserve great thanks of my Lord Maior,
and of all his Brethren. And herewith
he offered unto the said Doctor a bill,
containing the matter more at large.
But Doctor <HI>Standish</HI> wisely considering,
that there might more inconvenience
arise thereof, than he would wish, if he
should deale in such a sort: both refused
the bill, and told <HI>Lincolne</HI> plainely, that
he meant not to meddle with any such
matter in his Sermon.</P>
<P>Whereupon, the said <HI>Lincolne</HI> went
unto one Doctor <HI>Bell,</HI> a Canon of the
foresaid <HI>Spittle,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctor Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>der∣tooke to read <HI>Lin∣colns</HI> bill in the Pul∣pit.</NOTE> that was appointed like∣wise
to preach upon Tuesday in Easter-weake
at the same <HI>Spittle,</HI> whom hee
perswaded to reade his said bill in the
Pulpit: which bill contained (in effect)
the griefes that many found with stran∣gers,
for taking the livings away from
Artificers, and the entercourse from
Merchants, the redresse whereof must
come from the commons knit in one;
for as the hurt touched all men, so must
al set to their helping hands. Which let∣ter
he read,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The bill contained much sedi∣tious mat∣ter.</NOTE> or the chiefest part thereof,
comprehending much seditious matter.
And then he began with this sentence:
<HI>Coelum coeli Domino, terram autem dedit
filiis hominum.</HI> And upon this Text he
entreated, how this Land was given to
<HI>Englishmen,</HI> and as Birds defend their
nests, so ought <HI>Englishmen</HI> to cherish
and maintaine themselves, and to hurt
and grieve Aliens, for respect of their
Common-wealth. And on this Text,
<HI>Pugna pro Patria,</HI> he brought in, how (by
Gods Law) it was was lawfull to fight
for their Country:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pugna pro Patria.</NOTE> and thus he subtilly
moved the people to rebell against
strangers. By this Sermon, many a
light-headed person tooke courage, and
<PB N="81" REF="49"/>
openly spake against strangers: and by
mishap, there had beene divers evill
parts (of late) plaid by strangers, in and
about the Citie of <HI>London,</HI> which kin∣dled
the peoples rancor the more furi∣ously
against them.</P>
<P>The twenty eighth day of <HI>April,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Quarela urged to strangers as they were in the streets</NOTE> di∣vers
yong-men of the Citie picked qua∣rels
with certaine strangers, as they pas∣sed
along the streets: some they smote
and buffetted, and some they threw in
the channell: for which, the Lord Mai∣or
sent some of the Englishmen to pri∣son,
as <HI>Stephen Studley,</HI> Skinner, <HI>Steven∣son,
Bets,</HI> and other.</P>
<P>Then suddenly rose a secret rumour,
and no man could tell how it began, that
on <HI>May-day</HI> next following,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Evil <HI>May-day.</HI></NOTE> the Citie
would slay all the Aliens: insomuch
that divers strangers fled out of the Ci∣tie.</P>
<P>This rumour came to the knowledge
of the Kings Councell: whereupon the
Lord Cardinall sent for the Maior, and
other of the Councell of the Citie, gi∣ving
them to understand what hee had
heard.</P>
<P>The Lord Maior (as one ignorant of
the matter) told the Cardinall, that he
doubted not so to governe the Citie, but
as peace should be observed.</P>
<P>The Cardinall willed him so to doe,
and to take good heed, that if any rio∣tous
attempt were intended, he should
by good policy prevent it.</P>
<P>The Maior comming from the Car∣dinals
house,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A meeting of the L. Maior and his bre∣thren at Guildhall.</NOTE> about foure of the clocke
in the afternoone on <HI>May</HI> Eve, sent for
his Brethren to the <HI>Guild-hall,</HI> yet was
it almost seven of the clocke before the
Assembly was set. Vpon conference
had of the matter, some thought it ne∣cessary,
that a substantiall watch should
be set of honest Citizens, which might
withstand the evill doers, if they went
about any misrule. Other were of con∣trary
opinion, as rather thinking it best,
that every man should be commanded
to shut in his doores, and to keepe his
servants within. Before 8. of the clock,
Master Recorder was sent to the Cardi∣nall,
with these opinions: who hearing
the same,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Re∣corder &amp; Sir <HI>Thomas More</HI> sent to the Cardinall.</NOTE> allowed the latter. And then
the Recorder, and Sir <HI>Thomas More,</HI>
late under-sheriffe of <HI>London,</HI> and now
of the Kings Councell, came backe a∣gaine
to the Guild-hall, halfe an houre
before nine of the clock, and there shew∣ed
the pleasure of the Kings Councell:
whereupon every Alderman sent to
his Ward, that no man (after nine of
the clocke) should stir out of his house,
but keepe his doores shut, and his ser∣vants
within, untill nine of the clocke in
the morning.</P>
<P>After this commandement was gi∣ven,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Alder∣man resi∣sted, and put to flight.</NOTE> in the Evening, as Sir <HI>Iohn Mundy</HI>
Alderman, came from his Ward, hee
found two young-men in <HI>Cheape,</HI> play∣ing
at the Bucklers, and a great many of
young-men looking on them, for the
command seemed to bee scarcely pub∣lished;
he commanded them to leave
off; and because one of them asked him
why, hee would have him sent to the
Counter. But the Prentices resisted the
Alderman, taking the young-man from
him, and cryed Prentices, Prentices,
Clubs, Clubs: then out at every doore
came Clubs and other weapons, so that
the Alderman was forced to flight.
Then more people arose out of every
quarter, and forth came Servingmen,
Watermen, Courtiers, and other, so
that by eleven of the clocke, there were
in <HI>Cheape,</HI> 6. or 7. hundred, and out of
<HI>Pauls</HI> Church-yard came about 300.
From all places they gathered together,
and breake up the Counter, took out the

thither by the Lord Maior, for hurting
the strangers: also they went to <HI>New∣gate,</HI>
and tooke out <HI>Studley</HI> and <HI>Bets,</HI>

The Maior and Sheriffes were present,

<P>Being thus gathered into severall

<P>As they were thus intreating, and

<P>Some ran to <HI>Blanchapleton,</HI> and there
brake up the strangers houses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The stran∣gers hou∣ses broken up at <HI>Blanchapleton.</HI></NOTE> and spoi∣led

a clocke in the morning, at which time,
they began to withdraw: but by the

other, and sent to the Tower, <HI>Newgate</HI>

Sir <HI>Roger Cholmeley</HI> Lievtenant
of the Tower, during the time of this
businesse, shot off certaine peeces of
Ordnance against the City, but did no

<P>Then were the prisoners examined,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doctor <HI>Bell</HI> sent to the Tower for his Ser∣mon.</NOTE>

<P>On which day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Norfolke</HI> entred <HI>London</HI> with 1300 men.</NOTE> the Lord Maior, the

<P>On the thirteenth of May, the King

<P>When they were thus come before

order was observed through this Realm
during his reigne, and the reigne of
<HI>William Rufus:</HI> but <HI>Henry</HI> the first, re∣storing
to his Subjects the use of fire
and lights, as afore, it followeth (by
reason of Warres within the Realme)
that many men also gave themselves to
robbery and murders in the night: for
example whereof in this City, <HI>Roger
Hoveden</HI> writeth thus:</P>
<P>In the yeere 1175. a councell was kept
at <HI>Nottingham,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Roger Hove∣den manu∣script.</NOTE> in time of which Coun∣cell,
a brother of the Earle <HI>Ferrers,</HI> being
in the night privily slaine at <HI>London,</HI> and
thrown out of his Inne into the durty street
when the King understood thereof he sware
that he would be revenged on the Citizens.
For it was then (saith mine Author) a
common practice in this City; that a hun∣dred
or more in a company, young and old,
would make nightly invasions upon houses
of the wealthy, to the intent to rob them,
and if they found any man stirring in the
City within the night, that were not of their
crue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nightwal∣kers mur∣thered all they met.</NOTE> they would presently murder him:
insomuch, that when night was come, no
man durst adventure to walk in the streets.
When this had continued long, it fortuned,
that as a crue of yong and wealthy Citizens
assembling together in the night, assaulted
a stone house of a certaine rich man, and
breaking through the wall, the good man
of that house, having prepared himselfe
with other in a corner, when hee percei∣ved
one of the theeves, named <HI>Andrew
Bucquint,</HI> to lead the way, with a burning
brand in the one hand, and a pot of coles in
the other, which hee assaied to kindle with
the brand, he flew upon him, and smote off
his right hand, and then with a loud voyce
cryed theeves. At the hearing whereof, the
theeves tooke their flight, all saving he that
had lost his hand, whom the good man (in
the next morning) delivered to <HI>Richard
de Lucie</HI> the Kings Iustice.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rich theeves most wor∣thy to bee hanged.</NOTE> This theefe,
upon warrant of his life, appeached his con∣federates,
of whom many were taken, and
many were fled. Among the rest that were
apprehended,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The judg∣ment of fire and water cal∣led <HI>Ordalii,</HI> was con∣demned by Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> the third 1205. De∣cretal. lib. 5.</NOTE> a certaine Citizen of great

<HI>Iohn Senex,</HI> who for as much he could not
acquit himselfe by the Water-doome (as
that law was then tearmed) hee offered to
the King five hundred pounds of silver for
his life. But forasmuch as he was condem∣ned
by judgement of the Water, the King
would not take the offer, but commanded
him to be hanged on the Gallowes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cause why watches in the night were com∣manded and when.</NOTE> which was
done, and then the City became more quiet
for a long time after.</P>
<P>But for a full remedy of enormities
in the night, I read, that in the yeere of
Christ 1253. <HI>Henry</HI> the third comman∣ded
Watches in Cities, and Borough
Townes to be kept, for the better obser∣ving
of peace and quietnesse amongst
his people.</P>
<P>And further, by the advice of them
<PB N="84" REF="51"/>
of <HI>Savoy,</HI> hee ordained, that if any man
chanced to be robbed, or by any means
damnified, by any theese or robber; he
to whom the charge of keeping that
Country, City or Borough chiefly ap∣pertained,
where the robbery was done,
should competently restore the losse.
And this was after the use of <HI>Savoy;</HI> but
yet thought more hard to bee observed
here, than in those parts: and therefore
leaving those laborious Watches, I will
speake of our Pleasures and Pastimes in
watching by night.</P>
<P>In the Months of <HI>Iune</HI> and <HI>Iuly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bonefires and ban∣queting in the streets</NOTE> on the
Vigils of Festivall dayes, and on the
same Festivall dayes in the Evenings,
after the Sun-setting, there were usually
made Bone-fires in the streets, every
man bestowing wood or labour towards
them. The wealthier sort also before
their doores, neere to the said Bonefires
would set out Tables on the Vigils, fur∣nished
with sweete bread, and good
drinke, and on the Festivall dayes with
meats and drinkes plentifully, where∣unto
they would invite their neigh∣bours
and passengers also to sit, and
be merry with them in great familiarity,
praysing God for his benefits bestowed
on them. These were called Bonefires,
as well of amity amongst neighbours,
that being before at controversie, were
there by the labour of others reconciled,
and made of bitter enemies, loving
friends; as also for the vertue that a great
fire hath, to purge the infection of the
ayre. On the Vigill of Saint <HI>Iohn Bap∣tist,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marching watch at Midsum∣mer.</NOTE>

had ye besides the standing watches, all

were appointed 700. Cressers, 500. of
them being found by the Companies,
the other 200. by the Chamber of <HI>Lon∣don.</HI>
Besides the which lights,<NOTE PLACE="marg">More than 240. Con∣stables in <HI>London,</HI> the one halfe of them each night went in the mar∣ching watch, the otherhalfe kept their standing watch in every street and lane.</NOTE> every

of every Cresset was in light two shil∣lings
foure pence, and every Cresset had

to beare a bag with light, and to serve it:
so that the poore men pertaining to the
Cressets, taking wages, besides that eve∣ry
one had a strawen hat, with a badge
painted, &amp; his break fast in the morning,
amounted in number to almost 2000.

Wiffers, Drummers, and Fifes, Stan∣dard

Watches came one after the other in

<P>Here I could enter into a further rela∣tion,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Divers men yet living, have been and still are most bountifull benefa∣ctors to the poore, and many other reli∣gious uses</NOTE> concerning some men yet living,
whose liberall bounty and most Chri∣stian
charity, doth deserve no meane
commendation, and is very little infe∣riour
to many of them already named.</P>
<P>But because they account it honour e∣nough
to them, that divers poore peo∣ple
(in private) should rather sufficient∣ly
finde it, than the world (in publike)
know it, I am content to spare their no∣mination,
as knowing very well, that
they who have beene so liberall in their
life time, have (no doubt) set downe ex∣traordinary
determinations, which nei∣ther
death, nor any deceiving Execu∣tors,
can or shall frustrate and disap∣point.</P>
<P>Let me commend that truly-religious
man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The testi∣mony of a good and godly con∣science in∣deed.</NOTE> who perceiving the heavy want of
divers honest house-holders, laboriously
end<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vouring (night and day) to main∣taine
their charge; but that the worlds
extremity frowned too fiercely upon
them. I know the man, and oftentimes
in teares hath he said to mee; Here is
true poverty indeed, too modestly silent
in speaking their mighty need and mi∣sery,
and therefore justly deserving pit∣tie.
To two, three, foure, and many
times more of these, hath he beene, and
is, a liberall Benefactor (weekely) with
his owne hands: yet not in his owne
name, or as comming from himselfe,
(he being so meanely disguised at such
times of his comming to them, and so
sudden also in departing from them,
that they were not able to distinguish
him;) but alledging, that the reliefe
was sent them from some, who under∣stood
their neede (almost) as well as
themselves, and willed them to bee
thankfull onely to God for it.</P>
<P>Oh that <HI>London</HI> had a Park neer adjoi∣ning
to it, stored with many such choise
Deere; as doubtlesse it hath, though
not easily knowne. For some build
Almes-houses, Free-Schooles, Caw∣seyes
and Bridges in very needfull pla∣ces:
yea, and repaire old ruined Chur∣ches,
releeving Hospitals also in very
bountifull manner, and are weekly Be∣nefactors
to Prisons: yet performed by
such agents faithfully, that the true be∣stowers
are not noted, though vehe∣mently
suspected; and the glory they
shunne here, will (for ever) shine on
them else-where. But God stirre up the
mindes of many more, to imitate them
in this tonguelesse liberality.</P>

<P>And here let mee tell you, that the

because she made her owne eyes
the witnesses, to all or the greater part

<P>And yet at the time of her death,
of children and childrens children, she
had no lesse than two and twenty: A
motive very able to hinder charity, espe∣cially
in a worldly and covetous minde.</P>
<P>Neverthelesse, looking on all the
parts disposed to her children, and the
other dividents beside, she selected out
so bountifull a portion for those poore
members of Christ, that (even to the
worlds end) may successively remember
her good done to them, and justly
terme her their liberall and mercifull
mother.</P>
<P>One thing (above the rest) I may not
forget; because in deliverances from a∣ny

duty and gratitude to God.</P>

except on the South side from <HI>Bow-lane</HI>
to the said Standard, which is of <HI>Cord∣wayner-street</HI>
Ward. Then by the Stan∣dard
to the great Crosse, which is in
<HI>Creplegate</HI> Ward on the North side, and
in <HI>Breadstreet</HI> Ward on the South side:
and to the little Conduit by <HI>Pauls</HI> gate,
from whence (of old time) the said high
street stretched straight on to <HI>Ludgate,</HI>
all in the Ward of <HI>Farringdon</HI> within,
then divided truely from East to West:
but since,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. <HI>Pauls</HI> Church burned in the Con∣querour time.</NOTE> by meanes of the burning of
<HI>Pauls</HI> Church, which was in the reigne
of <HI>William</HI> the first, <HI>Mauricius,</HI> then Bi∣shop
of <HI>London,</HI> laid the foundation of a
new Church, so farre in largenesse ex∣ceeding
the old, that the way towards
<HI>Ludgate</HI> was thereby greatly straight∣ned,
as before I have discoursed.</P>
<P>Now, from the North to the South,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Citie divided frō north to south, into an east halfe &amp; a west halfe.</NOTE>
this Citie was (of old time) divided,
not by a large highway or street, as from
East to West, but by a faire Brooke of
sweet water, which came from out the
North Fields, through the Wall and
midst of the Citie, into the River of
<HI>Thames,</HI> and which division is (till this
day) constantly and without change
maintained. This water was called (as
I have said) <HI>Walbrooke;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The course of <HI>Wal∣brooke,</HI> and reason of the name.</NOTE> not <HI>Gallus</HI> brook,
of a <HI>Romane</HI> Captaine, slaine by <HI>Ascle∣piodatus,</HI>
and throwne therein, as some
have fabuled; but of running through
and from the Wall of this Citie. The
course whereof, (to prosecute it parti∣cularly)
was and is from the said Wall,
to Saint <HI>Margarets</HI> Church in <HI>Lothbu∣ry;</HI>
from thence, beneath the lower part
of the Grocers Hall, about the East part
of their Kitchen, under Saint <HI>Mildreds</HI>
Church, somewhat West from the said
Stockes Market: from thence, through
<HI>Buckles berry,</HI> by one great house buil∣ded
of stone and Timber, called the old
Barge; because Barges out of the River
of <HI>Thames</HI> were then rowed up so farre
into this Brooke, on the backe-side of
the houses in <HI>Walbrooke</HI> street, (which
street taketh name of the said Brooke)
By the West end of S. <HI>Iohns</HI> Church
upon <HI>Walbrooke,</HI> under <HI>Horshooe</HI> Bridge,
<PB N="114" REF="67"/>
by the West side of Tallow-Chandlers
Hall, and of the Skinners Hall, and so
behind the other houses to <HI>Elbow lane,</HI>
and by a part thereof, downe <HI>Greene∣witch
lane,</HI> into the River of <HI>Thames.</HI></P>
<P>This is the course of <HI>Walbrooke,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The course of <HI>VVal∣brooke</HI> ar∣ched over.</NOTE> which
was (of old time) bridged over in divers
places, for passage of horses and men, as
need required: but since, by meanes of
encrochment on the banks thereof, the
channel being greatly straightned, and
other annoyances done thereunto, at
length the same (by common consent)
was arched over with bricke, and paved
with stone, equall with the ground,
where-through it passed, and is now in
most places builded upon, that no man
may by the eye discerne it; and there∣fore
the trace thereof is hardly knowne
to the common people.</P>
<P>This Citie being thus divided from
East to West,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This City divided intowards</NOTE> and from North to
South; I am now further to shew, how
the same was (of old time) broken into
divers parts, called Wards, whereof
<HI>Fitzstephen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fitzstephen.</NOTE> more than foure hundred
yeeres since, writeth thus: <HI>This Citie</HI>
(saith he) <HI>even as</HI> Rome, <HI>is divided into
Wards: it hath yeerely Sheriffes, in stead
of Consuls: It hath the dignity of Senators
in Aldermen, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The number of these Wards in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wards in <HI>London 24.</HI> Patent Record.</NOTE> were both before and in the reigne
of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, 24. in all: whereof
13. lay on the East side of the said <HI>Wal∣brooke,</HI>
and 11. on the West. Notwith∣standing,
these 11. grew much more
large than those on the East: and ther∣fore
in the yeere of Christ, 1393. the
seventeenth of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, <HI>Fa∣ringdon</HI>
Ward, which was then one en∣tire
Ward, but mightily increased of
buildings without the gates; was by
Parliament appointed to be divided in∣to
twaine, and to have two Aldermen,
to wit, <HI>Faringdon</HI> within, and <HI>Faringdon</HI>
without, which made up the number
of twelve Wards on the West side of
<HI>Walbrooke,</HI> and so came the whole num∣ber
of 25. on both sides.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wards in <HI>London 25.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Moreover, in the yeere 1550. the Mai∣or,
Communalty, and Citizens of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
purchasing the liberties of the Bur∣rough
of <HI>Southwarke,</HI> appointed the
same to be a Ward of <HI>London;</HI> and so

PORTSOKEN
VVARD:
The first Ward in the East part.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>Eeing that of every of
these Wards I have to
say somewhat,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Portsoken</HI> ward.</NOTE> I will be∣gin
with <HI>Portsoken</HI> ward
without <HI>Ealdgate.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Portsoken,</HI> which
soundeth the Franchise at the gate, was
sometime a <HI>Guild,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. Trinit. Knighten Guild.</NOTE> and had beginning in
the dayes of King <HI>Edgar,</HI> more than six
hundred yeeres since. Therewere then
13. Knights or Souldiers, well belo∣ved
to the King and Realme, for servi∣ces
by them done, who requested to
have a certaine portion of Land on the
East part of the Citie, being left deso∣late
and forsaken by the Inhabitants, by
reason of too much servitude. They be∣sought
the King to have this Land, with
the liberty of a <HI>Guild</HI> forever. The King
granted to their request, with conditi∣ons
following; to wit, That each of
them should victoriously accomplish
three Combates; one above the ground,
one under ground, and the third in the
water.</P>
<P>And after this, at a certaine day in
East <HI>Smithfield,</HI> they should runne with
Speares against all commers; all which
was gloriously performed; and the same
day the King named it <HI>Knighten Guild,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bounds of <HI>Knighten Guild,</HI> or <HI>Portsoken</HI> ward.</NOTE>
and so bounded it, from <HI>Ealdgate,</HI> to the
place where the barres now are toward
the East, on both the sides of the street,
and extended it towards <HI>Bishopsgate</HI> in
the North, unto the house then of <HI>Willi∣am
Presbyter,</HI> afterward of <HI>Geffrey Tan∣ner,</HI>
and then of the heires of <HI>Clover;</HI>
after that, of <HI>Iohn Easeby:</HI> but since of the
Lord <HI>Bourchier,</HI> &amp;c. And againe, to∣wards
the South, unto the River of
<HI>Thames,</HI> and so farre into the water, as a
Horseman entring the same, might ride
at a low water, and throw his Speare.
So that all East <HI>Smithfield,</HI> with the
right part of the street that goeth to
<HI>Dodding</HI> Pond, into the <HI>Thames,</HI> and al∣so
the Hospitall of Saint <HI>Katharine,</HI> with
the Mils, that were founded in King
<HI>Stephens</HI> dayes, and the outward stone
wall, and the new ditch of the Tower,
were of the said Fee and Liberty: for
the said wall and ditch of the Tower,
were made in the time of King <HI>Richard</HI>
the first, when he was in the holy Land,
by <HI>William Longshampe,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Ely,</HI>
as before I have noted unto you.</P>
<P>These Knights had as then none o∣ther
Charter, by all the dayes of <HI>Edgar,
Ethelred,</HI> and <HI>Cnutus,</HI> untill the time of
<HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, whom the heires
of those Knights humbly besought to
confirme their liberties: whereunto he
graciously granting, gave them a Deed
thereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. Trinit.</NOTE> as appeareth in the Booke of
the late house of the holy Trinity. The
said Charter was faire written, in the
<HI>Saxon</HI> letter and Tongue.</P>
<P>After this, King <HI>William,</HI> the sonne of
<HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, made a confir∣mation
of the same Liberties, unto the
heires of those Knights, in these words:</P>
<P><HI>William,</HI> King of <HI>England,</HI> to <HI>Mau∣rice,</HI>
Bishop, and <HI>Godfrey de Magum,</HI>
and <HI>Richard de Parre,</HI> and to his faith∣full
people of <HI>London,</HI> greeting: Know yee
me to have granted to the men of <HI>Knighten
Guild,</HI> the <HI>Guild</HI> that belonged to them,
and the Land that belonged thereunto,
with all Customes, as they had the same
in the time of King <HI>Edward,</HI> and my Fa∣ther.

Witnesse <HI>Hugh de Buche;</HI> at <HI>Re∣thing.</HI></P>
<P>After him, King <HI>Henry</HI> the first con∣firmed
the same by his Charter, to the
like effect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Priory of the Trini∣ty within <HI>Ealdgate.</HI></NOTE> the recitall whereof I preter∣mit
for brevity. After which time, the
Church of the holy Trinity within <HI>Eald∣gate</HI>
of <HI>London,</HI> being founded by Queen
<HI>Matilde,</HI> wife to the said <HI>Henry,</HI> the mul∣titude
of brethren praising God there∣in,
in short time so increased, that all
the Citie was delighted in beholding
of them: insomuch that in the yeere
1115. certaine Burgesses of <HI>London,</HI> of
the progeny of those Noble <HI>English</HI>
Knights; to wit, <HI>Radulphus Fitzalgod,
Wilmarde le Devereshe, Orgare le Prude,
Edward Hupcornehill, Blackstanus,</HI> and
<HI>Alwine</HI> his kinsman, and <HI>Robert</HI> his bro∣ther,
the sonnes of <HI>Leofstanus</HI> the Gold∣smith,

Algare Secusme,</HI> comming together into
the Chapter house of the said Church
of the holy Trinity,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Knighten Guild</HI> givē the Canōs of the ho∣ly Trinity.</NOTE> gave to the same
Church and Canons serving God ther∣in,
all the Lands and Soke called in
English, <HI>Knighten Guild,</HI> which lyeth to
the wall of the Citie without the same
gate, and stretcheth to the River of
<HI>Thames:</HI> they gave it, I say, (taking up∣on
them the brotherhood and partici∣pation
of the benefits of that house) by
the hands of Prior <HI>Norman.</HI></P>
<P>And the better to confirme this their
Grant, they offered upon the Altar
there, the Charter of <HI>Edward,</HI> together
with the other Charters which they had
thereof; and afterward they did put
the foresaid Prior in seisin thereof, by
the Church of Saint <HI>Buttolphs,</HI> which is
builded thereon, and is the head of that
Land. These things were thus done, be∣fore
<HI>Bernard</HI> Prior of <HI>Dunstable, Iohn</HI>
Prior of <HI>Derland, Geffrey Clinton</HI> Cham∣berlaine,
and many other Clerkes and
Laymen, French and English: <HI>Orgare le

to King <HI>Henry,</HI> beseeching him to con∣firme
their gift, which the King gladly
granted by his deed.</P>

of <HI>London,</HI> to the Sheriffes and Provost,
and to all his Barons, and faithfull people,
French and English, of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Mid∣dlesex,</HI>
greeting: Know ye me to have gran∣ted

of the holy Trinity of <HI>London,</HI> the
Soke of the English <HI>Knighten Guild,</HI> and
the Land which pertaineth thereunto, and
the Church of S. <HI>Buttolph,</HI> as the men of
the same Guild have given and granted un∣to
them: And I will and straightly com∣mand,
that they may hold the same well, and
honourably and freely, with Sacke and Soke,
Toll and Thea, infangthefe, and all customes
belonging to it, as the men of the same Guild
in best sort had the same in the time of King
<HI>Edward,</HI> and as King <HI>William</HI> my Fa∣ther,

their Writs. Witnesse, <HI>A.</HI> the Queene,

thus seised of the said land and soke of
<HI>Knighten Guild,</HI> a part of the Suburbe
without the wall, (but within the liber∣ties
of the City) the same Prior was for
him, and his successors, admitted as one
of the Aldermen of <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prior of the Trini∣ty an Al∣derman of <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> to governe
the same land and soke. According to
the Customes of the City, hee did sit
in Court, and rode with the Maior and
his Brethren the Aldermen, as one of
them in Scarlet, or other livery as they
then used; untill the yeere 1531. at the
which time, the said Priory (by the last
Prior there) was surrendred to King
<HI>Henry</HI> the eight in the 23. of his reigne,
who gave this Priory to Sir <HI>Thomas
Audley,</HI> Knight, Lord Chancelor of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
and hee pulled downe the Church.
Sithence the which dissolution of that
house, the said Ward of <HI>Portsoken,</HI> hath
<PB N="117" REF="68"/>
been governed by a temporall man, one
of the Aldermen of <HI>London,</HI> and elected
by the Citizens, as by the Aldermen of

of <HI>Knighten Guild,</HI> or <HI>Portsoken</HI>
Ward, and for the antiquity and govern∣ment
thereof.</P>
<P>Now for the parts therein, this is spe∣cially
to be noted. First, the East part
of the Tower standeth there, then an
Hospitall of Saint <HI>Katharine,</HI> founded
by <HI>Matilde</HI> the Queene, wife to King
<HI>Stephen,</HI> by licence of the Prior and Co∣vent

gave to them the Manor of <HI>Clarton</HI> in
<HI>Wiltshire,</HI> and <HI>Vpchurch</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> &amp;c.
Queene <HI>Philip,</HI> wife to King <HI>Edward</HI> the
third, 1351. founded a Chauntry there,
and gave to that Hospitall tenne pound
land by yeere; it was of late time cal∣led
a free Chappell, a Colledge, and an
Hospitall for poore sisters. The Quire,
which (of late yeeres) was not much in∣feriour
to that of <HI>Pauls,</HI> was dissolved
by Doctor <HI>Wilson,</HI> a late Master there,
the brethren and sisters remaining. This
house was valued at 315. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 14. <HI>s. 2. <ABBR>d.</ABBR></HI>

by the ayd of divers devout Citizens to

dedicated by <HI>Ralfe Stratford,</HI> Bishop of

<P>Neere adjoyning to this Abby,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A farme by the <HI>Mi∣nories,</HI> wherein hath been sold three pints of milke for one halfe-penny, in memo∣ry of men living.</NOTE> on
the South side thereof, was sometime a
Farme belonging to the said Nunrie, at
the which Farme, I my selfe (in my
youth) have fetched many a halfe-pen∣ny
worth of milke, and never had lesse
than three ale pintes for a halfe penny
in the Summer, nor lesse than one ale
quart for a halfe-penny in the Winter,
alwaies hot from the Kine, as the same
was milked and strained. One <HI>Trolop,</HI>
and afterwards <HI>Goodman,</HI> were the Far∣mers
there, and had thirty or forty Kine
to the paile. <HI>Goodmans</HI> son, being heire
to his fathers purchase, let out the
ground, first for grazing of horses, and
then for Garden plots, and lived like a
Gentleman thereby. He lyeth buried in

<P>On the other side of that street,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ditch of the City lay open and was cleansed, but now filled up.</NOTE> lyeth
the Ditch without the walls of the City
which of old time was used to lye open,
alwaies (from time to time) cleansed
from filth and mud, as need required, of
great breadth, and so deepe, that divers
watring horses, where they thought it
shallowest, were drowned both horse
and man. But now of later time, the
same Ditch is inclosed, and the bankes
thereof let out for Garden plots, Car∣penters
yards, Bowling Allies, and di∣vers

the City wall is hidden, the Ditch fil∣led
up, a small Channell left, and that
very shallow.</P>
<P>From <HI>Ealdgate</HI> East, lyeth a large
street, and high-way, sometime reple∣nished
with few, but faire and comely
buildings; on the North side whereof,
first was and is, the Parish Church of

<P>There is a faire Vault under ground,
<PB N="119" REF="69"/>
purposely made (as appeareth) for the
whole Family. Over which Vault (be∣ing
in the East end of the Chancell, but
leaning somewhat to the North) is a
faire ancient Tombe of Alabaster, inge∣niously
wrought: having these lines fol∣lowing
engraven thereon:
<Q>Here lyeth <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Darcy</HI> of the
North, and sometime of the Order of the
Garter. Sir <HI>Nicholas Carew,</HI> Knight,
sometime of the Garter. Lady <HI>Eliza∣beth

take to his infinite mercy. <HI>Amen.</HI></Q></P>
<P>On the North side of this Tombe,
there is a small Monument, fixed in the
wall, bearing this inscription:
<Q>Here lyeth Sir <HI>Edw. Darcy,</HI> Knight, <HI>third</HI>
Son of Sir <HI>Arthur Darcy,</HI> Knight, of the

in <HI>Kent,</HI> the 28. day of October. <HI>Anno
Dom. 1612.</HI> He being 69. yeeres old.</Q></P>
<P>Another smaller Monument is also
fixed in the same wall, but somewhat
more toward the South, having this in∣scription:
<Q>Here lyeth buried the corps of <HI>Robert Tay∣lor,</HI>
of <HI>Silverdale,</HI> in the Parish of
<HI>Warton</HI> in the County of <HI>Lancaster,</HI>
Gentleman, the Father of <HI>Iohn Taylor,</HI>

15. day of <HI>February, An. Dom. 1577.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Vpon the ground, under the head of
the Communion Table, lyeth an anci∣ent
faire stone, and these lines engraven
theron in brasse:
<Q>Hic jacet <HI>Ioannes,</HI> Episc. <HI>Bathon.</HI> &amp;

<P>Neere unto the place where the Mi∣nister
readeth Divine Service, there is a
small brasse plate fixed in the wall, a
very unworthy Monument (in my mind)
for a man of so great charity and boun∣ty,
not having so much as a graven stone
bestowed on him upon the ground. The
Plate containeth these lines following.</P>
<Q>Here before this Pew lyeth buried the body
of <HI>Robert Dow,</HI> Citizen and Merchant-Taylor
of <HI>London,</HI> with <HI>Lettice</HI> his
Wife, and <HI>Thomas</HI> his Son. Which <HI>Ro∣bert</HI>

this Citie, and elsewhere sundry wayes,
as to severall Hospitals abroad and at

housholders, of the Merchant-Taylors
Company <HI>in perpetuum,</HI> gave to this

<P>In the North Ile of the Chancell, ly∣eth
a faire stone on the ground, with
this inscription upon it, engraven in
brasse:
<Q>Here lyeth the body of <HI>William Cowch,</HI>
one of the ordinary Yeomen of her Maje∣sties
Chamber, Citizen and In-holder of
<HI>London.</HI> He deceased the 13. day of <HI>Iu∣ly,

<P>In the middle Ile of the Church, be∣fore
the entrance into the Chancell, ly∣eth
a faire Grave-stone on the ground,
having this inscription engraven upon
Brasle upon it:
<Q><P>Dies mei sicut umbra declinaverunt,

<P>Here under this Stone lyeth buried the bo∣dy
of <HI>Robert Cockes,</HI> late Citizen and
Tallow-Chandler of <HI>London:</HI> Who by
his last will and Testament, gave to this
Ward of <HI>Portsoken</HI> (wherein he dwelt)
the summe of one hundred pounds, to be
employed for the use and benefit of the
poore of the said Ward. He departed this
mortall life the 20. day of September,
<HI>An. Dom. 1609.</HI> and was here enter∣red
the 3. day of October next following:
<HI>Aetatis suae. LXVII.</HI></P>
<P>Vixi dum volui, volui dum Christe volebas,
Christe mihi spes es, vita, corona, salus.</P></Q></P>
<P>In the same Ile, but a little lower, ly∣eth
another faire grave-stone, having (in
a whiter kind of stone) a coat of Armes
on it, and a description in well formed
letters, speaking thus:
<Q><P>Here underneath this stone, lyeth the body
of <HI>Daniel Balgay,</HI> sometime an Inhabi∣tant
of this Parish; of good account and
credit: being a Citizen of this honoura∣ble
City of <HI>London,</HI> and free of the wor∣shipfull
Company of the Mercers: Who
parted this mortall life the 20. day of
DDDecember, in the yeere of our Lord, 1608
being the day of the Nativity of our Lord
Iesus Christ.</P>
<P>Christus mihi vita.</P></Q></P>
<P>In the Church-yard Southward, and
toward the street, standeth a handsome
Ttombe, well defenced over from wea∣ther,
and a faire Grave-stone upon it.
Beneath, on the outside of the Tombe,
are engraven the Armes belonging to
the Vintners, and the Barber Chirurgi∣ons:
upon the Grave-stone is a faire
plate of Brasse, with all these following
lines engraven on it:
<Q>Here under this Stone lyeth the body of
<HI>George Clarke,</HI> Citizen and Vintner of
<HI>London,</HI> who by his last Will and Testa∣ment,
gave for divers good and chari∣table
uses, these Legacies hereafter fol∣lowing.</Q></P>
<P>First, for a publike Schoole in the
Vniversity of <HI>Oxenford,</HI> the summe of
two hundred pounds.</P>
<P>To the use of the poore of the foure
Precincts of the Ward of <HI>Portsoken,</HI> be∣ing

<HI>Aldgate,</HI> the summe of 293. pounds
6. shillings, 8. pence.</P>
<P>To the Parish of <HI>White Chappell,</HI> for
the reliefe of the poore there, the sum
of 230. pound.</P>

<Q>He deceased the 19. day of April, <HI>Anno
Dom. 1606.</HI> And was here buried the
24. day of the same next following: <HI>Ae∣tatis

<P>East from this Parish Church, there
are certaine faire Innes, for receipt of
Travellers repairing to the City, up to∣wards
<HI>Hog-lane</HI> end, somewhat within
the Barres, and a marke there shewing,
how farre the liberties of the City doe
extend.</P>
<P>This <HI>Hog-lane</HI> stretcheth North to∣ward
S. <HI>Mary</HI> Spittle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hog-lane.</NOTE> without <HI>Bishops∣gate,</HI>
and within these 40. yeeres, had
(on both sides) faire hedge-rowes of
Elme Trees, with Bridges and easie
Stiles to passe over into the pleasant
fields, very commodious for Citizens
therein to walke, shoote, and otherwise
to recreate and refresh their dulled spi∣rits,
in the sweet and wholsome ayre,
which is now (within few yeeres) made
a continuall building throughout, of
Garden houses, and small Cottages:
and the fields on either side bee turned
into Garden plots, Tenter-yards, Bow∣ling
Allies, and such like; from <HI>Hounds∣ditch</HI>
in the West, so farre as <HI>White Chap∣pell,</HI>
and further towards the East.</P>
<P>On the South side of the High-way
from <HI>Aldgate,</HI> were some few tenements
thinly scattered here and there, with
many voyd spaces betweene them up to
<PB N="121" REF="70"/>
the Barres. But now that street is not
onely replenished with buildings out∣ward,
and also pestred with divers Al∣leys,
on either side to the Barres; but
to <HI>White Chappell</HI> and beyond.</P>
<P>Amongst the which late buildings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Water-Conduit at <HI>Aldgate.</HI></NOTE>
one, memorable for the commodity of
that East part of this Citie, is a faire wa∣ter-Conduit,
hard without the gate, the
building whereof, in the yeere 1535.
Sir <HI>Bohn Allen</HI> being Maior, two fif∣teenes
were granted by the Citizens, for
the making, and laying of pipes to con∣very
water from <HI>Hackney</HI> to that place,
and so that worke was then finished.</P>
<P>Here I may not omit to tell you, that
although this Water-Conduit was very
beneficiall to the people inhabiting
there round about: yet in regard of the
situation, being then upon the streets
South side, and immediately descen∣ding
downe many steps or stayres of
stone, it was troublesome to the poore
people fetching water there, in com∣ming
up laden with their Tubs, Pailes,
anand Tankards. Beside, vntill the turne
of each party came by order and due
course, their Tankards, Tubs, and Pailes
did greatly pester the passage about and
thorow the Gate, endangering divers
personall harmes, and other great incon∣veniences.
Which since then, at the
taking downe of the old Gate, that a
new might bee builded in the same
place, is exceeding commendably a∣mended,
to the Cities honour, their
credit that had care for the disposing of
the worke, and great case of the poore.
Water-bearers, and all passengers. For
now there is a faire spacious Court,
wherein all the Tankards and other ves∣sels
orderly stand, (without any annoy∣ance
to the Street:) and the descent to
the Conduit is made very convenient,
free from offending one another in their
labour, the passage to and fro is so aptly
ordered, and the roome so large for
their attendance.</P>
<P>The old ruinous Gate being taken
downe, and order provided for a new
foundation: divers very ancient peeces
of <HI>Romane</HI> coyne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The two pieces of Coyne were of <HI>Traionus</HI> &amp; <HI>Dioclesianus</HI> Emperors▪</NOTE> were found among
the stones and rubbish; which as Mr.
<HI>Martin Bond</HI> (a Worshipfull Citizen,
and one of the Surveyors of the worke)
told me, two of them (according to their
true forme and figure) he caused to bee
carved in stone, and fixed on eyther
side of the Gates Arch without, East∣ward.</P>
<P>The rest of these stamped <HI>Romane</HI>
peeces, were sent for by the Lord Maior
an his brethren to the <HI>Guild-hall,</HI>
where as yet they remaine to be seene.
Moreover, under his owne hand-wri∣ting,
he delivered me this briefe note,
which (for mine owne discharge) I have
here set downe.</P>
<Q>The 10. day of March, <HI>Anno 1607.</HI> I
<HI>Martin Bond,</HI> laid the first founda∣tion
stone of <HI>Ealdgate,</HI> Northward.
The bottome of which foundation was
sixteene foot deepe, and eight foot
broad.</Q>
<P>Now concerning the building of the
Gate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Begun to be taken downe in <HI>An. 1606.</HI> and fini∣shed in <HI>An. 1609.</HI></NOTE> what time it was in hand, and the
care and paines taken about it: it would
require a larger explanation, than here
I am limited unto. But the Gate being
very worthily and famously finished, it
may be thus described to posterity.</P>
<P>Eastward, upon the height of the
Gate, standeth a faire golden Spheare,
with a goodly Vane on it. On the upper
Battlements (as vigilant Sentinels, and
kept waking by <HI>Fames</HI> golden Trum∣pet)
are placed the shapes of two armed
ancient Souldiers, each holding a great
stone in his hand, as denying the en∣trance
of any bold enemy, or such as are
not friends to the City.</P>
<P>Beneath, in a faire large square, stan∣deth
the imaginary figure of our Royall
Soveraigne King <HI>Iames,</HI> in bright gilt
Armour, at whose feet (on either side)
lye the Lion and golden-chained Vni∣corne
mildly couching, as expressing
awe and humility in so great a pre∣sence.</P>
<P>So much for the out-side of the Gate,
with the two <HI>Romane</HI> Coynes before re∣membred.</P>
<P>Westward, or within, highest of all,
standeth Fortune, ingenuously carved
and guilded, standing upon her Globe
or Mound, with her Saile spreading
over her head, and looking with a
gracefull and auspicious countenance
upon the Citie.</P>
<P>Beneath her, in a large square, are
<PB N="122" REF="71"/>
placed the Kings Armes, richly wrought
and engraven, bearing the Motto,
<Q><P>DIEV EST MON DROIT.</P>
<P>And a little lower,</P>
<P>VIVATE REX.</P></Q></P>
<P>Somewhat lower, and to grace each
side of the Gate, are set two feminine
personages, the one Southward, appea∣ring
to be Peace, with a silver Dove up∣on
her one hand, and a guilded wreath
or garland in the other. On the North
side standeth Charity, with a child at
her breast, and another led in her hand:
Implying (as I conceive) that where
Peace, and love or Charity do prosper,
and are truly embraced, that Citie shall
be for everblessed.</P>
<P>Over the Arch of the Gate is thus
fairely ingraven:
<Q><P>Senatus Populus{que} Londinens. fecit, 1609.</P>
<P>And vnderneath:</P>
<P>HVMFREY WELD, Maior.</P></Q></P>
<P>From <HI>Ealdgate</HI> Northwest to <HI>Bishops∣gate,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hounds-ditch.</NOTE> lyeth the Ditch of the Citie, cal∣led
<HI>Hounds-ditch,</HI> because that in old
time, when the same lay open, much
filth (conveyed forth of the Citie) espe∣cially
dead dogs, were there laid or
cast: wherfore (of later time) a mud wall
was made, inclosing the Ditch, to keep
out the laying of such filth as had beene
accustomed.</P>
<P>Over against this mudde wall, on the
other side of the street, was a faire field,
sometime belonging to the Priory of
the <HI>Trinity,</HI> and since, by Sir <HI>Tho. Awd∣ley,</HI>
given to <HI>Magdalen</HI> Colledge in <HI>Cam∣bridge.</HI>
This field (as all other about the
Citie) was inclosed, reserving open
passage thereinto, for such as were dis∣posed.
Towards the street were some
small Cottages, of two stories high, and
little Garden-plots backward, for poore
bedred people, (for in that street dwelt
none other) builded by some Prior of
the holy <HI>Trinity,</HI> to whom that ground
belonged.</P>
<P>In my youth, I remember, devout
people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bedred people in <HI>Hounds-ditch.</HI></NOTE> as well men as women of this
Citie, were accustomed oftentimes (e∣specially
on Fridayes weekely to walke
that way purposely) there to bestow
their charitable Almes, every poore
man or woman lying in their bed with∣in
their window, which was towards
the street, and open so low, that every
man might see them; a cleane linnen
cloth lying in their window, and a paire
of Beads, to shew that there lay a bed∣red
body, unable but to pray onely. This
Street was first paved in the yeere
1503.</P>
<P>About the latter end of the reigne of
King <HI>Hen. 8.</HI> three brethren that were
Gun-founders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brasse ord∣nance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in <HI>Hounds-ditch.</HI></NOTE> surnamed <HI>Owens,</HI> gate
ground there to build upon, and to in∣cloze
for casting of Brasse Ordnance.
These occupied a good part of the street
on the field side, and in short time di∣vers
others also builded there, so that
the poore bedred people were worne
out, and in place of their homely Cot∣tages,
such houses builded, as doe ra∣ther
want roome than rent; which hou∣ses
bee for the most part possessed by
Brokers, sellers of old apparell, and such
like. The residue of the field was for
the most part made into a Garden, by a
Gardiner named <HI>Cawsway,</HI> one that then
served the Markets with herbs &amp; roots:
and in the last yeere of King <HI>Edw.</HI> the 6.
the same was parcelled into Gardens,
wherein are now many faire houses of
pleasure builded.</P>
<P>But as it is fatall to the Suburbs of e∣very
great Citie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A matter greatly de∣serving reformati∣on in <HI>Hounds-ditch.</HI></NOTE> to be infected with
some foule and unclean Birds, that there
build their nests, although not with pro∣fessed
and ignominious staine of lewd
life; because (within the limits of
<HI>Hounds-ditch)</HI> dwell many a good and
honest Citizen, that will never endure
such scandalous neighbourhood: yet
there are crept in among them a base
kinde of vermine, wel-deserving to bee
ranked and numbred with them, whom
our old Prophet and Countryman <HI>Gyl∣das,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The un∣conscio∣nable broking Vsurers their li∣ving.</NOTE>
called <HI>Aetatis atramentum,</HI> the black
discredit of the Age, and of place where
they are suffered to live. Or rather (as S.
<HI>Bernard</HI> thinkes it more convenient to
terme them) <HI>Baptisatos Iudaeos;</HI> who
take themselves to be Christians, when
they are worse (indeed) than the <HI>Iewes</HI>
ever were for usurie.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Iewes</HI> were ne∣ver any such grip∣ple Extor∣tioners.</NOTE></P>
<P>These men, or rather monsters in the
shape of men, professe to live by len∣ding,
and yet will lend nothing but up∣on
pawnes; neither to any, but unto
<PB N="123" REF="71"/>
poore people onely, and for no lesse
gaine, than after fifty or threescore <ABBR>l.</ABBR> in
the hundred. The pawne of the poore
borrower, must needs be more than dou∣ble
worth the money lent upon it, and
the time of limitation is no longer than
a moneth; albeit they well know, that
the money needs not be repayed backe,
untill a twelvemoneths end. By which
time, the interest growes to be so great,
that the pawne, which (at the first) was
better than twice worth the money bor∣rowed
on it, doth not (in the end) prove
to be valuable to the debt, which must
be prayed, before the poore party can
redeeme it. By which extorting meanes
of proceeding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Such gaines are the gree∣dy Vsurers glory.</NOTE> the poore borrower is
quite cheated of his pawne, for lesse than
the third part, which it was truly worth
indeed.</P>
<P>It is a great errour (in my poore opi∣nion)
that in so ancient and famous a
Citie, abounding (otherwise) in most
Christian Almes and workes of mercy,
that among so many worthy liberalities
bestowed on the poore in divers and di∣stinct
Parishes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A publike stocke would doe well for the poore in every Parish.</NOTE> no order is taken for
such a publicke stocke, for the truely-poore,
that when in their urgent neces∣sitie,
either by want of meanes, sicknesse
and other hinderances, their pawnes
may not goe to the cut-throat Vsurer;
but remaine to their owne good (living
or dying) or to theirs; without any o∣ther
benefit, than that it may still serve
for the like reliefe.</P>
<P>And let mee not here bee mistaken,
that I condemne such as live by honest
buying and selling, and make a good
conscience of their dealing: no truely, I
meane onely the <HI>Iudas</HI> Broker, that
lives by the Bagge, and (except God be
more mercifull to him) will follow him
that did beare the Bagge.</P>
<P>On the ditch side of this street, the
mudde wall which was, is also (by little
and little) taken all downe, the Banke
of the ditch being raised, made levell
ground, and turned into Garden-plots,
and Carpenters yards, and many large
houses are there builded, for the uses
before remembred; the filth of which
houses, as also the earth cast out of their
vaults, is turned into the ditch; by
which meanes the ditch is filled up,
and both the ditch and wall so hidden,
that they cannot be seene of the passers
by.</P>
<P>Here, according to my purpose in all
other Wards and Parishes, I meane
not to forget Gods blessings bestowed,
by the hands and mercifull mindes of
charitable Benefactors. In this Parish
of Saint <HI>Buttolphs</HI> without <HI>Aldgate,</HI> these
persons following doe justly deserve
memory.</P>
<Q>Benefactors to the Poore.</Q>

<P>Walking downe <HI>Hounds ditch</HI> North∣ward,
so far as the dwelling house of one
<HI>Edward Ansell,</HI> Carpenter, they there
crosse the way Eastward into <HI>Still</HI> and
<HI>Hand</HI> Alley, passing on along by a Gar∣den

goodly Place, termed sometime, <HI>Fishers
Folly.</HI> Thence they proceed into <HI>Hogge∣lane,</HI>
in the middle of which lane, is the
partition betweene the two Parishes of
<HI>White Chappell</HI> and S. <HI>Buttolphs.</HI> There
they goe on to the Barres in the com∣mon
street, and crossing the way South∣ward,
goe thorow a now Tavern house,
knowen by the name of the Castle,
where turning backe againe, the bredth
of two small Gardens, they then passe
on right forward (west) to the <HI>Minories</HI>

<P>There (at the further end) they turne
downe into an Alley, called <HI>Brownes</HI>
Alley, to a Wall being by <HI>Goodmans</HI>
Fields, and so along by that wall, so far
as to <HI>Goodmans</HI> gate. Where, by reason
of a controversie hapning betweene the
Parish of <HI>White Chappell</HI> and Saint <HI>But∣tolphs,</HI>
and a Barne and other buildings
erected in the way, they are constrained
to turne up into the street againe. Then
they goe downe <HI>Red-Lion</HI> Alley, to the
house of one <HI>Darby Morgan,</HI> passing on
thence directly into <HI>Rosemary lane.</HI> Then
downe on the South side, till they come
to the East side of a new Church-yard,
there builded at the Parishes cost, and
for their helpe in times of sicknes. There
they goe thorow an house, then thorow
the Church-yard, and afterward tho∣row
the house of one <HI>Iohn Batcheler.</HI>
Thence they goe down <HI>Nightingale lane,</HI>
on the West side, untill they come to
the middle of a Foord, which sometime
turned <HI>Wapping</HI> Mill; and there the fore∣said
two Parishes are divided againe by
that Foord. Then goe they on so far as
M. <HI>Duppa,</HI> or <HI>Duppers</HI> house, and so

within that part, where the wall of the
Citie (of old time) went straight from
the Posterne gate South to the River of
<HI>Thames,</HI> before that the Tower was
builded. From and without the Tower
ditch west and by north, is the said
Tower Hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tower hill.</NOTE> sometime a large plot of
ground, now greatly streightned by in∣croachments
(unlawfully made and suf∣fered)
for Gardens and houses, some on
the banke of the Tower-ditch, whereby
the ditch is marred, and more neere un∣to

large Scaffold and Gallowes of timber,
for the execution of such Traitors or
Transgressors, as are delivered out of

of <HI>London</HI> by writ, there to be executed.
I read, that in the fifth of King <HI>Edward</HI>
the fourth, a Scaffold and Gallowes
were there set up by other the Kings Of∣ficers,
and not of the Cities charges;
whereupon the Maior and his Brethren
complained, but were answered by the
King, that the Tower hill was of the li∣berty
of the Citie; and whatsoever was
done in that point, was not in deroga∣tion
of the Cities liberties, and there∣fore
commanded Proclamation to bee
made, aswell within the Citie as in
the Suburbs, as followeth:</P>
<P>Forasmuch as the seventh day of this pre∣sent
moneth of November, Gallowes were
erect and set up besides our Tower of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
within the liberties and franchises of
our Citie of London, in derogation and pre∣judice
of the liberties and franchises of this
Citie: The King our Soveraigne Lord
would have it be certainely understood, that
the erection and setting up of the said Gal∣lowes
was not done by his commandement:
wherefore, the King our Soveraigne Lord
willeth, that the erection and setting up of
the said Gallowes, be not any president, or
example thereby hereafter to be taken, in
hurt, prejudice or derogation of the franchi∣ses,
liberties and priviledges of the Citie,
which he at all times hath had, and hath in
his benevolence, tender favour, and good

<Q>Apud Westminst. nono die Novembris,

<P>Many Controversies have beene in
times past, betwixt the Lord Maior and
Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> on th'one party, and
the Lieutenant of the Tower of <HI>London</HI>
on th'other party, touching their liber∣ties:
The Lieutenant usurping divers
priviledges which were against the
Lawes of the Realme: as for example:</P>
<P>If <HI>A. B.</HI> were indebted to <HI>C. D.</HI> dwel∣ling
in the precinct of the Tower, and
would suffer himselfe to be arrested and
prosecuted by the said <HI>C. D.</HI> in the
Court held within the Tower, and there
to have judgement upon the said debt
obtained against him: after which
judgement obtained, a Precept was
<PB N="126" REF="73"/>
awarded under the seale of office of the
Lieutenant, redirected unto the Porter
of the Tower or to his deputy, to take
<HI>A. B.</HI> in execution for the same debt.
And after that <HI>A. B.</HI> is so taken in exe∣cution,
there is returne made of the exe∣cution
of the said Precept; and there∣upon
the Lieutenant not onely appoin∣teth
about a dozen or more Keepers to
the said <HI>A. B.</HI> and such as the said <HI>A. B.</HI>
will nominate;<NOTE PLACE="marg">This pre∣tended Priviledge is directly against the Lawes of the Realm, as here∣under is resolved by the Iudges.</NOTE> but also suffereth the
said <HI>A. B.</HI> to goe at liberty, giving unto
him a Protection under the seale of his
Office: And thereby commandeth all
Officers in any wise to forbeare to arrest
or trouble the said <HI>A. B.</HI> for the space of
one whole yeere, beeing his prisoner.
Then if it shall happen that the said <HI>A.
B.</HI> shall be arrested, being in the custo∣dy
of any of his Keepers, and having the
said Protection to shew; if immediate∣ly
upon the shewing of the same, he bee
not set at liberty againe, In such case,
the Lieutenant pretendeth that he hath
power to arrest the body of any person,
dwelling in such Citie or Countie,
wherein the said <HI>A. B.</HI> was so arrested
and troubled, if any such person can bee
found within the liberties of the Tower,
and the body of the same person to de∣taine
in safe custody, untill such time as

and proofes of both parties,
and did accordingly certifie their opini∣ons
thereof to the Lords of the Privie

<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>The Certificat, touching as well the Ar∣ticles
and Complaints made to your Ho∣nours,
by Robert Smith and VVilliam
VVikius, against Sir Owen Hopton,
Knight, Lieutenant of the Tower, as
the controversies between the Ma∣ior
and Citizens of London
and the said Lieutenaut.</HEAD>
<P>FIrst, upon examination of the mat∣ter,
touching the said <HI>Smith</HI> and
<HI>VVikins,</HI> mentioned in your Ho∣nours
letters, it appeareth unto us, that
(some controversie being betweene the
Maior and Citizens, and the said Lieu∣tenant,
touching a Garden-plot neere
the said Tower) one <HI>Ralph Gasken,</HI> ser∣vant
to the said Lieutenant, violently
did draw forth of the said Garden, one
<HI>Shapeley,</HI> servant to the said <HI>VVikins,</HI> then
labouring there for his said Master, in
such violent manner, as thereby blood
was drawne of him in severall places,
and carried him to the Tower, and there
kept him in prison eight dayes; and that
one <HI>Shawe,</HI> another of the Lieutenants
servants, was present with the said <HI>Gas∣ken</HI>
ayding him, but that he did not hurt
the said <HI>Shapeley;</HI> which <HI>Gasken</HI> and
<HI>Shawe</HI> did detaine some of the apparell
of the said <HI>Shapeley,</HI> and yet doe for any
thing knowene to us.</P>
<P>And that likewise one <HI>Payne</HI> was ta∣ken
forth of the said Garden, and carri∣ed
to the Tower, and there imprisoned
three dayes, and then delivered upon
bond, to render his body to the Tower
when he should be required, and that
<HI>Payne</HI> hath left a pawne of the value of
tenne shillings for his meat and drinke.</P>
<P>And that Her Majesties VVrit of
<HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> for the body of <HI>Shape∣ley</HI>
was sued forth of her Bench, directed
to the Lieutenant, which carried and
delivered to him by the said <HI>Smith,</HI> who
prayed the said Lieutenant to make al∣lowance
thereof, and paid him the Fee
due therefore. But forthwith he would
have forced the said <HI>Smith</HI> to have recei∣ved
the money againe and the VVrit:
which <HI>Smith</HI> refused to doe, praying
him not to be offended for bringing of
her Majesties Processe.</P>
<P>And thereupon Master Lieutenant
said he would put his VVrit in his poc∣ket,
as he had done many, and there∣with
rubbed <HI>Smith</HI> on the cheekes, and
threatned to imprison him, if he would
not carry backe the VVrit againe and
the money: whereupon the said Lieu∣tenant
imprisoned <HI>Smith,</HI> and detained
him about three houres, untill upon a
Bill of his hand to returne to prison
when the Lieutenant should send for
him, he was delivered; which matter
the Lieutenant confesseth to be true.</P>
<P>And touching such liberties as Ma∣ster
Lieutenant claimeth to have beene
<PB N="129" REF="74"/>
used for the Officers and Attendants in
the Tower, as not to be arrested by any
Action in the Citie of <HI>London,</HI> and
Protections to be granted to them by
Master Lieutenant, and not obeying of
VVrits of <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> we thinke such
persons as are daily attendant in the
Tower, serving her Majesty there, are
to be priviledged, and not to be arrested
upon any plaint in <HI>London.</HI> But for
VVrits of execution, or <HI>Capias ut liga∣tum,</HI>
and such like, we thinke they ought
to have no priviledge.</P>
<P>Moreover, touching Protections gran∣ted
by Master <HI>Lieutenant,</HI> for such as be
condemned in any action in the Court
kept in the Tower, to goe at large, and
not to be arrested by any Processe out
of the Queenes high Courts, or else∣where,
or any other Protection to that
effect, for any priviledged person, we
thinke the same against Her Majesties
Lawes and dignity.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> That Matter Lieutenant ought
to returne every <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> out of
any Court at <HI>Westminst.</HI> so as the Justi∣ces
before whom it shall bee returned,
(as the cause shall require) may either
remand it with the body, or retaine the
matter before them, and deliver the bo∣dy,
as Justice shall require.</P>
<P>As touching the jurisdiction of the
Court in the Tower, and the contro∣versies
for certaine liberties upon the
Tower-hill, and the soile there, and di∣vers
places about the Tower, we are not
yet fully resolved, but desire your Lord∣ships

<P>WHereas sundry variances
&amp; contentions have here∣tofore
arisen, and have of
late yeeres depended, betwixt the Lord
Maior and Communalty of the City of
<HI>London,</HI> on the one part; and the Lieu∣tenant
of Her Majesties Tower of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
on the other part, touching matters
of liberties, prescriptions, customes, and
other claimes and pretences: by reason
wherof, and for lack of order for stay of
those variances and contentions, divers
tumults have heretofore growne, and
Her Majesties Peace hath many times
beene in hazard to be dangerously bro∣ken;
whereupon, severall complaints
have beene heretofore exhibited to the
Lords and others of Her Majesties most
Honourable Privie Councell, by the
Lord Maior and Communalty afore∣said,
against the said Lieutenant, for di∣vers
injuries alleaged to bee offered on
his part to the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> with∣out
order of Law or equity: After con∣sideration
had of which severall com∣plaints,
it pleased their Lordships (ha∣ving
care to procure an end of those
controversies, for avoiding of inconve∣niences
that might ensue) by their Ho∣nourable
letters to give order to Sir
<HI>Christopher Wray,</HI> Knight, Lord chiefe
Justice of <HI>England;</HI> Sir <HI>Edmond Ander∣son,</HI>
Knight, Lord chiefe Justice of the
<HI>Common Pleas;</HI> and to Sir <HI>Gilbert Ger∣rard,</HI>
Knight, Master of the <HI>Rolles,</HI> that
they (calling the said Lieutenant and
the parties complainants before them)
should effectually heare and examine
the controversies (on both sides,) and
certifie their Lordships what they
should finde, together with their opi∣nions
<PB N="130" REF="75"/>
touching the same, who having
called the parties accordingly before
them, and advisedly and with good de∣liberation
sundry times heard their Al∣legations
and answers, as well by writing
as by word, with counsell learned on all
parts, have signified their opinions of
the said controversies in writing, as
hereafter followeth:</P>
<P>First, touching such liberties as M.
Lieutenant claimeth to have beene used
for the Officers and Attendants in the
Tower, as not to be arrested by any acti∣on
in the City of <HI>London,</HI> and prote∣ctions
to be granted to them, by Master
Lieutenant, and not obeying of writs
of we thinke such persons as bee
dayly attendant in the Tower serving
her Majestie there, are to be priviledged
and not to be arrested upon any plaint in
<HI>London,</HI> but for writs of Executions, or
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and such like, wee
thinke they ought to have no privi∣ledge.</P>
<P>Secondly, concerning protections
granted by Master Lieutenant for such
as bee condemned in any action in the
Court, kept in the Tower, to goe at
large, and not to be arrested by any Pro∣cesse
out of the Queenes high Courts,
or elsewhere, or any other protection to
that effect for any priviledged person,
we thinke the same against her Majesties
lawes and dignitie.</P>
<P>Thirdly, that M. Lieutenant ought
to returne every <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> out of a∣ny
Court at <HI>Westminster,</HI> so as the Iusti∣ces
before whom it shall be returned (as
the cause shall require) may either re∣mand
it with the body, or retaine the
matter before them, and deliver the bo∣dy
as Iustice shall require.</P>
<P>Lastly, whereas the Lieutenant doth
also claime a liberty, that if any person
priviledged in the Tower be arrested in
<HI>London,</HI> hee may take the body of any
Citizen that shall come within the li∣berties
of the Tower, and keepe his bo∣dy
there untill the other bee delivered,
we thinke the same to bee altogether a∣gainst
the lawes of the Realme.</P>
<P>The Lords therefore of her Majesties
said Privie Councell, upon grave and
deliberate considerations had of the cer∣tificate
and opinions of the said Lords
chiefe Iustices and Master of the Rolles,
and to the end occasions of contenti∣on,
trouble, and disorder, and the dan∣ger
of breach of her Majesties peace,
which have heretofore of late yeeres a∣risen
and growne upon the controversies
aforesaid, may from henceforth cease,
and bee althougher removed and taken
away;</P>
<P>It was this day by their Lordships or∣dered
and decreed, betwixt the Lord
Maior, Communalty and Citizens of
<HI>London,</HI> and their successors, and the
Lieutenant of her Highnesse said Tower
of <HI>London,</HI> and all other Lieutenants and
Officers of the Tower at any time here∣after
to succeed: That the matters, points
and articles contained in the Certificate
of the said Iustices and Master of the
Rolles before mentioned, wherein their
resolutions, opinions and determinati∣ons
be set downe, declared and signifi∣ed,
shall at all times from henceforth
stand and remaine for rules and resoluti∣ons
and finall determination and decisi∣on:
for so much and so many of the
points of controversies as are contained
in the said Certificate (whereof they
have delivered their opinions) to be for
ever hereafter duely observed and kept,
and that nothing bee hereafter at any
time done, or attempted on either part,
to the violating or interrupting of the
same.</P>
<P>On the North side of this hill, is the
said Lord <HI>Lumleyes</HI> house, and on the

<P>Comming now to the charities given
to the poore in this Parish, I finde no
nomination of any, but of one Mistris
<HI>Bainham,</HI> and Sir <HI>Iames Deane,</HI> whose
gifts are benevolence in bread weekely
to the poore. There standeth also in the
lower part of the Church, a memory of
one yet living, inscribed thus:
<Q><HI>Iohn High-Lord,</HI> senior, of <HI>London,</HI>
Skinner, in his life time, and in the 85.
yeere of his age, gave forty shillings yeere∣ly
for ever, to be bestowed in New-castle
Coales, for the reliefe of the poore in this
Parish of S. <HI>Olave</HI> in <HI>Hare-street.</HI></Q></P>
<P>There are many men of great and
good account in this Parish, who at
divers times are bountifull unto the
poore in money, and as they send it, it
<PB N="137" REF="78"/>
is faithfully divided among them.</P>
<P>Now for the limits and bounds of
the Parish, they go on from the Church
West, and turning downe on the East
side of <HI>Mart-lane,</HI> crosse the way over
to Sir <HI>Henry Bakers</HI> house, and so go up
on the West side, till turning into <HI>Hart∣street,</HI>
they goe on into <HI>Sydon-lane,</HI> so
farre as their marke standeth, on the
house of Sir <HI>Nicholas Salter,</HI> joyning to
theirs of <HI>Barking</HI> Parish. Then they goe
over on the West side, and so passe
downe <HI>Crochet Friers,</HI> to <HI>Tower-hill,</HI>
to the further part of the Lady <HI>Lumleys</HI>
garden wall, and the backe gate of the
foresaid Sir <HI>Nicholas,</HI> where turning
backe to <HI>Porters</HI> house, and going on
Northward, they goe into an Alley,
which guideth them to the North end
of Master <HI>Covels</HI> garden, and there they
fix their marke by theirs of <HI>Barking,</HI> on
<HI>London</HI> Wall.</P>
<P>So returning againe, they goe up
towards <HI>Aldgate</HI> on the East side, so far
as directly against the signe of the
Cocke, returning backe on the West
side to the Pumpe in <HI>Crochet Friers,</HI> and
then to the place where they began.</P>
<P>Here I was favoured by Master <HI>Iohn
Simpson,</HI> Parson of S. <HI>Olaves,</HI> and the
friendly Officers there.</P>
<P>Then have ye out of <HI>Tower street</HI> also
on the North side,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mart-lane,</HI> of a Mart kept about <HI>Blanch Chappelton,</HI> or <HI>Appleton.</HI></NOTE> one other lane, called
<HI>Mart-Lane,</HI> which runneth up towards
the North, and is for the most part of
this <HI>Tower-street</HI> Ward; which lane is
about the third quarter thereof, divided
from <HI>Aldgate</HI> Ward, by a chaine to bee
drawne thwart the said lane, above the
West end of <HI>Hart-street. Cokedon-lane,</HI>
sometime at the South-west end of
<HI>Mart-lane,</HI> I read of.</P>
<P>A third lane out of <HI>Tower-street</HI> on the
North side,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mincheon</HI> lane.</NOTE> is called <HI>Mincheon-lane,</HI> so
called of Tenements there, sometime
pertaining to the <HI>Minchuns</HI> or Nunnes
of S. <HI>Helens</HI> in <HI>Bishopsgate-street:</HI> This
Lane is all of the said Ward, except
the corner house towards <HI>Fen-Church-street.</HI></P>
<P>In this lane of old time dwelled di∣vers
strangers borne, of <HI>Genoa</HI> and those
parts; these were commonly called
<HI>Galley-men,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Galley-men dwel∣led there.</NOTE> as men that came up in the
Galleys, brought up Wines and other
Merchandises, which they landed in
<HI>Thames</HI> street, at a place called <HI>Galley</HI>
Key: they had a certaine coyne of siluer
amongst themselves, which were halfe
pence of <HI>Genoa,</HI> and were called <HI>Galley</HI>
halfe-pence. These halfe-pence were
forbidden in the 13. yeere of King <HI>Hen∣ry</HI>
the 4. and againe by Parliament in
the 4. of <HI>Henry</HI> the 5. it was enacted,
that if any person bring into this Realm
<HI>Galley</HI> halfepence, Suskins, or Dodkins,
he should be punished as a Thiefe, and
he that taketh or payeth such money,
shall lose an hundred shillings, whereof
the King shall have the one halfe, and
he that will sue, the other halfe: not∣withstanding
in my youth I have seene
them passe currant, but with some diffi∣culty,
for that the English halfe-pence
were then (though not so broad) some∣what
thicker and stronger.</P>
<P>The Cloth-workers Hall is in this
Lane.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cloth. workers Hall.</NOTE> Then at the West end of <HI>Tower-street,</HI>
have ye a little turning towards
the North,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gristes</HI> house.</NOTE> to a faire house, sometime
belonging to one named <HI>Griste,</HI> for hee
dwelled there in the yeere 1449. And
<HI>Iack Cade,</HI> Captaine of the Rebels in
<HI>Kent,</HI> being by him in this his house fea∣sted,
when he had dined, like an unkind
guest, robbed him of all that was there
to be found worth the carriage.</P>
<P>Next to this is another faire house,
sometime builded by <HI>Angell Dunne,</HI>
Grocer,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iohn Champneis,</HI> Alderman blind.</NOTE> Alderman of <HI>London;</HI> since pos∣sessed

in this house an high Tower of Bricke,
the first that ever I heard of in any pri∣vate
mans house, to overlooke his neigh∣bours
in this Citie. But this delight of
his eye was punished with blindnesse
some yeeres before his death. Since
that time, Sir <HI>Percevall Hart,</HI> a jolly
Courtier, and Knight Harbenger to the
Queene, was lodged there, &amp;c.</P>
<P>From this house somewhat West, is
the Parish Church and Parsonage house
of Saint <HI>Margaret Pattens,</HI> to the which
Church and house on the North side,
and as farre over against on the South,
stretcheth the farthest West part of this
Ward. And therefore, to begin againe
at the East end of <HI>Tower-street;</HI> on the

<P>Now, in regard that this Parish of S.
<HI>Dunstane</HI> is the last (in our account) of
<HI>Tower-street</HI> Ward, we are to speake of
Gods blessings there to the poore, which
I finde to be seven shillings three pence
every Sunday through the yeere, given
in ready money, beside bread and other
gifts, according to the wils and disposi∣tions
of Sir <HI>Richard Champion,</HI> and Ma∣ster
Alderman <HI>Heardson,</HI> with Coales
given beside at certaine times. More, I
finde, that one man hath given yeerely
for ever, an whole Oxe to be distributed
by a quarter thereof quarterly, and a
pecke of Oate-meale there withall to the
poore. But yet so discreetly ordered,
that they that have the quarter of Beese
and pecke of Oate-meale at one quarter,
must stay till other poore bee so served,
and that it comes to their turne againe.
Other charities there are which came
in gifts of ready money, and are accor∣dingly
truly distributed.</P>
<P>In the perambulation of this Parish,
they goe first so farre North from the
Church, as to the house next <HI>William
Offington,</HI> and thence returning, walke
down on the North side of <HI>Tower-street,</HI>
so farre as <HI>Mincheon-lane,</HI> and to the
house of Master <HI>Dumbelowe,</HI> next to
Clothworkers Hall, where they returne
againe, and so goe on to the signe of the
Dolphine in <HI>Tower-street,</HI> being a Ta∣verne.
There they crosse the way, and
goe downe the West side onely of <HI>Wa∣ter-lane,</HI>
and then walke along <HI>Thames-street,</HI>
leaving the Custome house, pas∣sing
on to <HI>Smarts-key;</HI> whence returning
backe into the Crosse-lane, so farre as
Sir <HI>Cuthbert Buckles</HI> house, now in the
custody of Sir <HI>Iohn Lemnian,</HI> Knight,
and Lord Maior of <HI>London,</HI> they goe
home to the place where they began.
Here I was favoured by Master <HI>Iohn
Childerlay,</HI> Doctor of Divinity, my wor∣thy
good friend, and his diligent Offi∣cers.</P>
<P>Now as concerning the two Church-lanes,
they meeting on the South side
of this Church and Church-yard, doe
joyne in one: and running downe to the
<HI>Thames-street,</HI> the same is called <HI>Saint
Dunstans Hill:</HI> at the lower end where∣of
the said <HI>Thames-street</HI> (toward the
West, on both sides almost to <HI>Belins-gate</HI>
but towards the East up to the VVater-gate,
by the Bulwarke of the Tower) is
all of <HI>Tower-street</HI> VVard. In this street
on the <HI>Thames</HI> side, are divers large lan∣ding
places, called VVharffes, or Keys,
for Cranage up of VVares and Mer∣chandise,
as also for shipping of Wares
from thence to be transported.</P>
<P>These Wharffes and Keys common∣ly
beare the names of their owners, and
are therefore changeable. I read, in the
26. of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, that in the Parish
of Saint <HI>Dunstane</HI> in the East, a tene∣ment
called <HI>Passekes</HI> Wharffe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Passekes VVharffe, <HI>and</HI> Hor∣ners Key.</NOTE> and ano∣ther
called <HI>Horners</HI> Key in <HI>Thames-street,</HI>
were granted to <HI>William Harindon</HI> Es∣quire.
I read also, that in the sixth of
<HI>Richard</HI> the second, <HI>Iohn Churchman</HI> Gro∣cer,
for the quiet of Merchants, did new∣ly
build a certaine house upon the Key,
called <HI>Wool-wharffe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wool-wharffe <HI>by</HI> Custo∣mers Key.</NOTE> in the <HI>Tower-street</HI>
Ward, in the Parish of <HI>Alballewes Bar∣king,</HI>
betwixt the tenement of <HI>Paul Sa∣lisbury,</HI>
on the East part, and the Lane
called the <HI>Water-gate</HI> on the West,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Water-gate <HI>by</HI> VVool Key.</NOTE> to
serve for Tronage, or weighing of
VVools in the Port of <HI>London:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Custome house.</NOTE> Where∣upon,
the King granted, that during the
life of the said <HI>Iohn,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tronage of Wools.</NOTE> the asoresaid Tro∣nage
should be held an kept in the said
<PB N="142" REF="81"/>
house, with easements there for the
Ballances and Weights, and a counting
place for the Customer, Controwlers,
Clerkes and other Officers of the said
Tronage, together with ingresse and re∣gresse
to and from the same, even as
was had in other places, where the said
Tronage was wont to be kept, and that
the King should pay yeerely to the said
<HI>Iohn</HI> (during his life) forty shillings, at
the termes of S. <HI>Michael</HI> and <HI>Easter,</HI> by
even portions by the hands of his Cu∣stomer,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Custome house.</NOTE> without any other payment to
the said <HI>Iohn,</HI> as in the Indenture there∣of
more at large appeareth.</P>
<P>Neere unto this <HI>Customers Key,</HI> to∣wards
the East, is the said Water-gate,
and West from it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Porters Key <HI>or</HI> Porters lane.</NOTE> <HI>Porters Key:</HI> then
<HI>Galley Key,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Galley Key.</NOTE> where the Galleys were u∣sed
to unlade, and land their Merchan∣dizes
and wares: and that part of <HI>Thames
street</HI> was therefore of some called <HI>Gal∣ley</HI>
row, but more commonly, <HI>Petty-Wales.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Petty-Wales.</NOTE></P>
<P>On the North side, as well as on the
South of this <HI>Thames-street,</HI> are many
faire houses, large for stowage, builded
for Merchants, towards the East end
thereof, namely, over against <HI>Galley Key,
Wooll Key,</HI> and the <HI>Custome-house.</HI> There
have beene of old time some large buil∣dings
of stone, the ruines whereof doe
yet remaine, but the first builders
and owners of them are worne out of
memory: wherefore the common peo∣ple
affirme <HI>Iulius Caesar</HI> to be the builder
thereof, as also of the Tower it selfe, but
thereof I have spoken already. Some
are of another opinion, and that a more
likely, that this great stone building,
was sometime the lodging appointed
for the Princes of <HI>Wales,</HI> when they re∣payred
to this City, and that therefore
the streete in that part is called <HI>Petty
Wales,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Princes of <HI>Wales</HI> their lodging.</NOTE> which name remaineth there most
commonly untill this day: even as
where the Kings of <HI>Scotland</HI> were used
to be lodged betwxit <HI>Charing-crosse,</HI> and
<HI>White-hall,</HI> it is likewise called <HI>Scotland:</HI>
and where the Earles of <HI>Brittain</HI> were
lodged without <HI>Aldersgate,</HI> the street is
called <HI>Brittain street,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The said building might (of old time)
pertaine to the Princes of <HI>Wales,</HI> as is a∣foresaid,
but is since turned to other
use.</P>
<P>It is before noted of <HI>Galley Key,</HI> that
the Gallies of <HI>Italy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mer∣chants of <HI>Italy</HI> their lodging by their Gal∣lies.</NOTE> and other parts, did
there discharge their VVines and Mer∣chandizes
brought to this City. It is
like therefore that the Merchants and
Owners procured the place to build up∣on
for their lodgings and store-houses,
as the Merchants of Haunce of <HI>Almaine</HI>
were licensed to have an house, called
<HI>Guilda Teutonicorum,</HI> the Guild-Hall of
the <HI>Germanes.</HI></P>
<P>Also the Merchants of <HI>Burdeaux</HI> were
licensed to build at the Vintry, strongly
with stone, as may yet be seene, and see∣meth
old, though often repaired: much
more cause have these buildings in <HI>Petty
Wales</HI> (though as lately builded, and
part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of the like stone brought from
<HI>Cane</HI> in <HI>Normandy)</HI> to seeme old,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Gal∣lies landed here in memory of men li∣ving.</NOTE> which
for many yeeres, to wit, since the Gal∣lies
left their course of landing there,
hath fallen to ruine, and been letten out
for stabling of horses, to Tipplers of
Beere, and such like. Amongst others,
one Mother <HI>Mampudding</HI> (as they ter∣med
her) for many yeeres kept this
house, or a great part thereof, for victu∣alling:
and it seemeth, that the builders
of the Hall of this house were Ship∣wrights,
and not house-Carpenters:
for the frame thereof (being but low)
is raised of certaine principall posts of
maine timber,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange kind of building by the Shippe-wrights or Galley-men.</NOTE> fixed deep in the ground,
without any groundsell, boorded close
round about on the inside, having none
other wal from the ground to the roofe:
those boords not exceeding the length
of a Clap-boord, about an inch thicke,
every boord ledging over other, as in a
Ship or Gally nayled with Ship nayles
called rough, and clench, to wit, rough
nayles with broad round heads, and
elenched on the other side with square
plares of Iron. The roofe of this Hall is
also wronght of the like boord, and nay∣led
with rough and clench, and seemeth
as it were a Gally, the Keele turned up∣wards:
and I observed, that no worme
or rottennesse is seene to have entred in∣to
either boord or timber of that Hall,
and therefore, in mine opinion, of no
great antiquity.</P>
<P>I read in the 44. of <HI>Edward</HI> the third,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Hospi∣tall for lu∣naticke or phrensie people.</NOTE>
that an Hospitall in the Parish of <HI>Bar∣king</HI>
Church, was founded by <HI>Robert
Denton</HI> Chaplen, for the sustentation of
<PB N="143" REF="81"/>
poore Priests, and other both men and
women, that were sicke of the Phrenzie,
there to remaine till they were perfectly
whole, and restored to good memory.</P>
<P>Also I read, that in the sixth of <HI>Hen.</HI>
5. there was in the Tower ward, a Mes∣suage
or great house, called <HI>Cobhams
Inne:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cobhams Inne.</NOTE> and in the 37. of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth,
a Messuage in <HI>Thames street,</HI> pertaining
to <HI>Richard Longvile,</HI> &amp;c. Some of the
ruines before spoken of, may seeme to
be of the foresaid Hospitall, belonging
peradventure to some Prior Alieu, and
so suppressed amongst the rest, in the
reigne of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, or <HI>Henry</HI> the
fifth, who suppressed them all.</P>
<P>Thus much for the bounds and Anti∣quity
of this Ward, wherein noted,
first, the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> three Pa∣rish
Churches, the Custome-house,
and two Hals of Companies; to wit,
the Cloth-workers, and the Bakers.</P>
<P>This Ward hath an Alderman, his

where that Ward endeth.</P>
<P>Thus much for the bounds: Now for
Monuments, or places most ancient and
notable. I am first to begin with the
late dissolved Priory of the holy Trini∣ty,
called <HI>Christs-church,</HI> on the right
hand within <HI>Ealdgate.</HI> This Prior<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was
founded by <HI>Matilda,</HI> Queene, wife to
<HI>Henry</HI> the first, in the same place where
<HI>Siredus</HI> sometime beganne to erect a
Church, in honour of that Crosse, and
and of S. <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> of which the
Deane and Chapter of <HI>Waltham</HI> were
wont to receive thirty shillings. The
Queene was to acquire her Church
thereof, and in exchange gave unto
them a Mill. King <HI>Henry</HI> her Husband
confirmed her gift. This Church was
given to <HI>Norman,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Priory of the <HI>Trinity</HI> of Canons regular.</NOTE> the first Canon regu∣lar
in all <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The said Queene also gave unto the
same Church, and those that served
God therin, the plot of <HI>Ealdgate,</HI> and the
Soke thereunto belonging, with all cu∣stomes,
so free as she had held the same,
and 25. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> Blanks, which she had of the
Citie of <HI>Excesser,</HI> as appeareth by her
Deed, wherein she nameth the house of
<HI>Christs-church,</HI> and reporteth <HI>Ealdgate</HI> to
be of her Demains, which she granteth,
with two parts of the rent of the Citie of
<HI>Excest. Norman</HI> took on him to be Prior
of <HI>Christs-church,</HI> in the yeere of Christ,
1108. in the Parishes of S. <HI>Mary Mag∣dalen,</HI>
S. <HI>Michael,</HI> S. <HI>Katharine,</HI> and the
blessed Trinity, which now was made
but one Parish of the holy <HI>Trinity,</HI> and
was (in old time) of the holy Crosse, or
holy Rood parish.</P>
<P>The Priorie was builded on a piece
of ground in the parish of Saint <HI>Katha∣rine,</HI>
towards <HI>Ealdgate,</HI> which lyeth in
length betwixt the Kings street, by the
which men goe towards <HI>Ealdgate,</HI> neere
to the Chappell of Saint <HI>Michael</HI> to∣wards
the North, and containeth in
length eighty thee Elles; halfe quarter,
and halfe quartern of the Kings Iron
Eln, and lyeth in bredth; &amp;c. The Soke
and Ward of <HI>Ealdgate</HI> was then boun∣ded,
as I have before shewn: the Queen
was a meane also, that the land and <HI>Eng∣lish
Knighten Guild</HI> was given unto the
Prior <HI>Norman,</HI> and the Honorable man
<HI>Geffrey de Clinton</HI> was a great helper
therein, and obtained, that the Canons
might inclose the way betwixt their
Church and the wall of the Citie, &amp;c.
This Priorie in processe of time became
a very faire and large Church, rich in
Lands and ornaments, and passed all
the Priories in the Citie of <HI>London,</HI> or
shire of <HI>Middlesex,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prior of <HI>Christs-Church</HI> an Alderman of <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> the Prior whereof
was an Alderman of <HI>London,</HI> to wit, of
<HI>Portsoken</HI> Ward.</P>
<P>I reade, that <HI>Eustacius,</HI> the eighth
Prior, about the yeere 1264. because
hee would not deale with temporall
matters, instituted <HI>Theobald Fitz Iuonis,</HI>
Alderman of <HI>Portsoken</HI> Ward under
him, and that <HI>William Rising,</HI> Prior of
<HI>Christs-Church,</HI> was sworne Alderman
of the said <HI>Portsoken</HI> Ward, in the first
of <HI>Richard</HI> the second. These Priors
have sitten and ridden amongst the Al∣dermen
of <HI>London,</HI> in Liverie like unto
them, saving that his habit was in shape
of a spirituall person, as I my selfe have
seene in my child-hood: at which time,
the Prior kept a most bountifull house
of meat and drinke, both for rich and
poore, aswell within the house, as at the
gates, to all commers, according to
their estates.</P>

<P>But to conclude of this Priory: King
<HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, minding to reward
Sir <HI>Thomas Audley,</HI> Speaker of the Par∣liament
against Cardinall <HI>Woolsey,</HI> as ye
may read in <HI>Hall,</HI> sent for the Prior,
commending him for his hospitality,
promised him preferment, as a man wor∣thy
of a far greater dignity; which pro∣mise
surely hee performed, and com∣pounded
with him, though in what sort
I never heard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Priory of the holy <HI>Trinity</HI> surren∣dred and suppressed</NOTE> so that the Priory, with
the appurtenances, was surrendred to
the King, in the moneth of <HI>Iuly,</HI> in the
yeere 1531. the 23. of the said Kings
reigne. The Canons were sent to other
houses of the same order, and the Prio∣rie,
with the appurtenances, King <HI>Hen∣ry</HI>
gave to Sir <HI>Thomas Audley,</HI> newly
Knighted, and afterwards made Lord
Chancelour.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Audley</HI> offered the great
Church of this Priorie, with a ring of
nine Bels well tuned (wherof foure the
greatest were since sold to the Parish of
<HI>Stebunhith,</HI> and the five lesser to the pa∣rish
of S. <HI>Stephen</HI> in <HI>Coleman-street)</HI> to
the parishioners of S. <HI>Katharine Christs-Church,</HI>
in exchange for their small Pa∣rish
Church, minding to have pulled it
downe, and to have builded there to∣wards
the street: But the parishioners,
having doubts in their heads of after∣claps,
refused the offer.</P>
<P>Then was the Priory Church and
steeple proffered to whomsoever would
take it downe, and carry it from the
ground; but no man would undertake
the offer. Whereupon, Sir <HI>Thomas Aud∣ley</HI>
was faine to be at more charges, than
could be made of the stones, timber,
lead, iron, &amp;c. For the workmen, with
great labour, beginning at the toppe,
loosed stone from stone, and threw
them downe, whereby the most part of
them were broken, and few remained
whole, and those were sold very cheap:
for all the buildings then made about
the Citie, were of Bricke and Timber.
At that time, any man in the Citie,
might have a Cart-load of stone for pa∣ving,
brought to his doore for 6. <HI><ABBR>d.</ABBR></HI> or 7.
<HI><ABBR>d.</ABBR></HI> with the carriage.</P>
<P>The said <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Audley</HI> builded
and dwelt on this Priorie during his
life, and dyed there in the yeere 1544.
since the which time, the said Priorie
came (by marriage of the Lord <HI>Audleys</HI>
daughter and heire) unto <HI>Thomas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke Place.</NOTE> late
Duke of <HI>Norfolke,</HI> and was then called
the <HI>Dukes Place.</HI></P>
<P>At this time the Inhabitants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The inha∣bitants the Duke <HI>place</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them∣selves Pa∣rishionem of St. <HI>Ka∣tharine Cree</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by lacked a Church of their owne.</NOTE> dwel∣ling
and abiding in the said <HI>Dukes place,</HI>
became utterly destitute of any Parish
Church, for resorting to Gods Divine
Service, and the administration of the
blessed Sacraments, which in the time
of their former blind zeale, the demoli∣shed
Priory not onely seemed for their
use, but infinite other thereto resorting.
In which respect, the Parish Church of
S. <HI>Katharine</HI> being so neere, and standing
in the Coemitery or Church-yard of the
late dissolved Priory of the Holy Trini∣ty,
whereby it was called <HI>Saint Katha∣rine
Christs Church:</HI> they resorted thi∣ther
at the houres of Divine Service,
and benefit of the blessed Sacraments;
whereby (to speake rightly) they be∣came
a burthen to the said Parish, yet
well enough borne withall, in regard of
the benefit ensuing by them. So that
they carried the respect of equall Pari∣shioners,
exercising and accomplishing
all duties there, even as if it had beene
their owne proper Parish.</P>
<P>The long continuance of them in
<PB N="147" REF="83"/>
this kinde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The time of such continu∣ance, did meerely make a custome of it in o∣pinion.</NOTE> although some much misli∣ked,
and giadly would have compassed
means for remedy therof: yet their pow∣er
not stretching so far, nor the way (as
yet fiting for their purpose; they re∣mained
contented against their wils, till
time would fit them with more conve∣nient
opportunity. Ground they wan∣ted
not, for raising a sufficient Parish
Church to themselves, neither did any
good will faile in them for the effecting
their purpose: but onely were curbed by
the lacke of strength, how and which
way to bring it about.</P>
<P>At length, perceiving their ground
(intended for so good a use to them∣selves)
aimed at for buildings to private
mens benefits, that so they might bee
frustrate of any such helpe, when occa∣sion
should in better manner shine on
them: Some of the best advised among
them, by petition sollicited the Lord
Archbishop of <HI>Canturbury,</HI> to make
their desire and intention known to the
Kings most excellent Majesty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arch∣bishop moved King <HI>Iames</HI> in the ju∣stice of the suit.</NOTE> which
most graciously he did. And the King
finding the case so truly honest and re∣ligious,
for new erecting a Chur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h where
such necessity required, and where su∣perstition
had so long time formerly
beene harboured: not onely gave the
Lord Archbishop and the sutors both
thankes and commendation; but also
under his Hand and broad Seale, au∣thorizable
warrant for their proceeding.
The Lord Maior and Senate of Alder∣men
having intelligence in the case, and
perceiving what an honour would re∣dound
thereby, first to God, who inspi∣red
them thereto, next to the King for
so Royally granting the suit, and then to
the City for furthering it to effect: not∣withstanding
contrary opposition by
them, who would have had them stil
continue, as formerly they were, with∣out
benefit of a parish Church of their
owne, it proceeded on with good and
prosperous successe, to the no meane ho∣nour
and commendation of the Lord
Maior then being, Sir <HI>Edward Barkham</HI>

<P>At the North-West corner of this
Ward in the said high street, standeth
the faire and beautifull Parish Church
of S. <HI>Andrew</HI> the Apostle, with an ad∣dition,
to be knowne from other Chur∣ches
of that name,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parish Church of S. <HI>Andrew Vndershaft.</HI></NOTE> of the <HI>Knape</HI> or <HI>Vn∣dershaft,</HI>
and so called S. <HI>Andrew Vnder∣shaft,</HI>
because that of old time, every
yeere (on May-day in the morning) it
was used,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A shaft or May-pole high∣er than the Church Steeple.</NOTE> that an high or long shaft, or
May-pole, was set up there, in the midst
of the street, before the South doore of
the said Church, which shaft when it
was set on end, and fixed in the ground,
was higher than the Church Steeple.
<HI>Geffrey Chawcer,</HI> writing of a vaine boa∣ster,
hath these words, meaning of the
said shaft.</P>
<Q><L>Right well aloft,</L>
<L>and high ye beare your head,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chawcer</HI> chance of dice.</NOTE></L>

<L>Lord so merrily</L>
<L>crowdeth then your croke,</L>
<L>That all the street</L>
<L>may heare your body cloke.</L></Q>
<P>This shaft was not raysed at any time
since evill May day (so called of an in∣surrection
made by Prentises,<NOTE PLACE="marg">As hath bin at large be∣fore de∣clared.</NOTE> and other
young persons against Aliens, in the
yeere 1517) but the said shaft was laid
along over the doores, and under the
Pentises of one rowe of houses, and Al∣ley
gate, called of the shaft, <HI>Shaft alley,</HI>
(being of the possessions of <HI>Rochester</HI>
bridge) in the ward of <HI>Limestreet.</HI></P>
<P>It was there, I say, hanged on iron
hookes amny yeeres, till the third of
King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixt, that one Sir <HI>Ste∣phen,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shaft or Maypole preached against at <HI>Pauls</HI> Crosse.</NOTE> Curate of Saint <HI>Katherine Christs
Church,</HI> preaching at <HI>Pauls</HI> Crosse, said
there, that this shaft was made an Idoll,
by naming the Church of Saint <HI>An∣drew,</HI>
with the addition of under that
shaft: he perswaded therefore, that the
names of Churches might be altered:
Also, that the names of dayes in the
weeke might be changed, the fish daies
to be kept any daies, except Friday and
Saturday, and the Lent any time, save
onely betwixt Shrovetide and Easter. I
have oft-times seene this man, forsaking
the Pulpet of his said Parish Church,
preach out of an high Elme tree in the
middest of the Church-yard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The said Elm tree his prea∣ching place is lately ta∣ken down.</NOTE> and then
entring the Church, forsaking the Al∣tar,
to have sung his high Masse in En∣glish,
upon a Tombe of the dead to∣wards
the North. I heard his Sermon at
<HI>Pauls</HI> Crosse, and I saw the effect that
followed: for in the after-noone of that
present Sunday, the neighbours, and
Tenants to the said bridge, over whose
doores the said Shaft had laine, after
they had dined, to make themselves
strong,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shaft or Maypole saved in pieces and burnt.</NOTE> gathered more helpe, and with
great labour raising the Shaft from the
hookes (whereon it had rested two and
thirty yeeres) they sawed it in pieces, e∣very
man taking for his share, so much
as had layne over his doore and stall,
the length of his house, and they of the
Alley, divided amongst them so much
as had laine over their Alley gate. Thus
was this Idoll (as he tearmed it) mang∣led,
and after burned.</P>
<P>Soone after was there a commotion
of the commons in <HI>Norfolke, Suffolke, Es∣sex,</HI>
and other shires, by meanes where∣of,
streight orders being taken for the
suppression of rumors, divers persons
were apprehended, and executed by
Marshall Law; amongst the which, the
Bayliffe of <HI>Rumford</HI> in <HI>Essex</HI> was one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bayliffe of <HI>Rum∣ford</HI> exe∣cuted within <HI>Ealdgate</HI> for words spoken to the priest of the pa∣rish.</NOTE> a
man very well beloved: he was early in
the Morning of <HI>Mary Magdalens</HI> day
(then kept holy-day) brought by the

Marshall, to the Well within <HI>Ealdgate,</HI>
there to be executed upon a Gibbet set
up that morning, where being on the

<P>Good people, I am come hither to

from the house of Master <HI>Iohn Holding,</HI>
commonly called <HI>Fletchers hall,</HI> and so

a great quantity of wood by ma∣king

also of certaine bread &amp; coales,
to be delivered to the Parishes of S. <HI>Ed∣mund</HI>

in <HI>Cornehill:</HI> and of divers messuages
and garden-plots in the Parish of S. <HI>O∣lave</HI>
in <HI>Hart-street, London,</HI> mentioned to
be given to the Company of Drapers,
for the performance thereof: Vpon a
perfect view of the Will it selfe, by
which the said Almes-houses were gi∣ven
to the Company of Drapers, and
upon other writings touching the same;
And withall, upon diligent and paine∣full
search touching that matter; I find
that Mr. <HI>Stowe</HI> was much deceived or
mistaken in that matter; and that there
was no such bread and coales given to
those Parishes, neither at any time had
the Company and such houses or gar∣dens,
whereby to performe the same.
But the Company, by the Will, had
lands given them in other Parishes,
(which now they doe enjoy) onely to
maintaine the Almes-houses, and for
payment of the pensions there, and to
pay some small summes of money to the
Officers and others of that Company,
for the looking to the houses, and paines
taking in paying the pensions, according
as by the Will is limited, and for no o∣ther
use or purpose.</P>
<P>Next to these Almes-houses is the
Lord <HI>Lumleyes</HI> house,<NOTE PLACE="marg">L. <HI>Lumleys</HI> house.</NOTE> builded in the
time of King <HI>Henry</HI> the 8. by Sir <HI>Thomas

stood: And this is the farthest part of
<HI>Ealdgate</HI> Ward toward the South, and
ioyneth to the Tower hill. The other
side of that Lane, over against the Lord
<HI>Lumleys</HI> house, on the wall side of the

builded, even to <HI>Ealdgate.</HI></P>
<P>Then have ye on the South side of
<HI>Fenne-Church street,</HI> over against the wall
or Pumpe, amongst other faire and
large-builded houses, one that some∣time
belonged to the Prior of <HI>Monte

towards the Crossed Friers, as is afore∣shewed.</P>
<P>This <HI>Northumberland</HI> house, in the

to <HI>Henry Percy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Northumb. house.</NOTE> Earle of <HI>Nor∣thumberland,</HI>
in the 33. of <HI>Hen.</HI> the 6. but
of late being left by the Earles, the gar∣dens
thereof were made into Bowling∣alleys,

common to all commers for their
money, there to bowle and hazard. But
now of late, so many Bowling-Alleys,
and other houses for unlawfull gaming,
have beene raised in other parts of the
Citie and the Suburbs, that this their
ancient and onely patron of misrule, is
left and forsaken of her Gamesters, and
therefore turned into a number of great
rents, small cottages, for strangers and
others.</P>
<P>At the East end of this lane, in the

<L>The Rule and Index</L>
<L>to finde all the good</L>
<L>That ever Heaven dealt</L>
<L>upon woman-hood:</L>
<L>For if we but</L>
<L>anatomize her life,</L>
<L>We find both a good woman,</L>
<L>and good wife:</L>
<L>First, she lov'd God,</L>
<L>Not like the Pharisee,</L>
<L>In ostentation</L>
<L>and hypocrisie;</L>
<L>But even with all her heart,</L>
<L>and all her soule:</L>
<L>She secretly</L>
<L>did raging sinne controule:</L>
<L>For she (for goodnesse sake)</L>
<L>was innocent,</L>
<L>And not for glory,</L>
<L>or feare of punishment.</L>
<L>Next, to her neighbour</L>
<L>did her love extend,</L>
<L>Ready to helpe at need,</L>
<L>and to befriend</L>
<L>The poore, and those</L>
<L>that never could repay,</L>
<L>But with their prayers</L>
<L>at the latter day:</L>
<L>The remnant of her love</L>
<L>she did bestow</L>
<L>Vpon her Husband,</L>
<L>not in outward show,</L>
<L>Or else in feign'd</L>
<L>adulterate flattery;</L>
<L>But in sound truth,</L>
<L>and deepe sincerity.</L>
<L>Thus did she live,</L>
<L>divided in her love</L>
<L>From this unworthy world:</L>
<L>and Nature then,</L>
<L>Which had but lent her,</L>
<L>tooke her backe agen.</L>
<L>Where let us live in peace,</L>

<L>To live like her,</L>
<L>that we like her may dye.</L>
<L>Come hither, Women,</L>
<L>leave your vanities,</L>
<L>Your lust, your scornes,</L>
<L>your pride, your fooleries?</L>
<L>For hither you must all.</L>
<L>The Dust and grave</L>
<L>All your adored</L>
<L>braveries must have:</L>
<L>And all those beauties</L>
<L>that are now afraid</L>
<L>Of Ayre, of Sunne,</L>
<L>must in the ground be laid.</L>
<L>Then decke your soules,</L>
<L>unto whose quintessence,</L>
<L>Nor time, nor death,</L>

<P>Concerning Charity to the poore in
this Parish, besides the Christian dis∣position
of the parishioners themselves,
I finde by information, that Sir <HI>Iames
Deane</HI> hath given two shillings weekly
in bread for ever, which is duely perfor∣med
every Friday. And as much they
themselves doe give in bread every
Sunday.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Henry Billingsley</HI> (by his will) gave
the sum of 200. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> for reliefe of the poor
in this Parish; but by not making his
own eyes Overseers, and his hands his

injured, and the poore disappointed.</P>

Mr. <HI>Wright,</HI> the learned Parson

the shape of an Alderman in Scar∣let,
kneeling on his knees, and the

his name to be <HI>William White,</HI> Maior of
this honourable Citie. Whereby his is
perswaded, and I am likewise of his o∣pinion,
(by divers opinions thereto in∣ducing)
that all that Ile was either of

whereof I finde record in the 14.

<P>This house, in the ninth of <HI>Richard</HI>

gave it to <HI>Iohn Gill,</HI> Master, and to the
Wardens and Fraternity of Taylors,
and Linnen Armorers of Saint <HI>Iohn
Baptist</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> and to their successors
for ever. They did set up in place ther∣of
a faire large frame of Timber, con∣taining
in the high street one great
house, and before it, to the corner of
<HI>Limestreet,</HI> three other tenements, the
corner house being the largest: and then
downe <HI>Limestreet</HI> divers proper Tene∣ments.
All which the Merchant-taylors
in the reigne of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, sold
to <HI>Stephen Kirton,</HI> Merchant-taylor and
Alderman: he gave with his daughter
<HI>Grisild,</HI> to <HI>Nicholas Woodroffe,</HI> the said
great house, with two tenements before
it, in lieu of an hundred pounds, and
made it up in money, three hundred six∣ty
six pounds, thirteene shillings, foure
pence. This worshipfull man, and the
Gentlewoman his widdow after him,
kept those houses downe <HI>Limestreet</HI> in
good reparations, never put out but one
Tenant, tooke no fines, nor raised
rents for them, which was tenne shil∣lings
the piece yeerely: But whether
that favour did over-live her Funerall,
the Tenants now can best declare the
contrary.</P>
<P>Next unto this on the high street was
the Lord <HI>Sowches</HI> messuage or tenement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Messuage of the L. <HI>Sowch.</HI></NOTE>
and other. In place whereof, <HI>Richard
Wethell,</HI> Merchant-Taylor, builded a

the second in number, the first of tim∣ber

<P>Then is there another faire house,
builded by <HI>Stephen Kirton,</HI> Alderman:
Alderman <HI>Lee</HI> did then possesse it, and

<P>Afterwards, in the reigne of <HI>Henrie</HI>

and of the Kings Councell, what should

<P>Touching the Chappell there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A brother∣hood of 60 Priests in the Chap∣pell of <HI>Leaden hall.</HI></NOTE> I find,

which 60. Priests, every Market-day in

Service there, to such Market people as
repaired to prayer, and once every yeere
they met all together, and had solemne
Service, with Procession of all the Bre∣thren

and Sisters. This foundation was
in the yeere 1512. by a common Coun∣cell
confirmed to the 60. <HI>Trinity</HI> Priests
and to their successors, at the will of the
Maior and Communalty.</P>
<P>In the yeere 1484. a great fire hap∣ned
upon the <HI>Leaden-Hall,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Leaden-hall</HI> burned.</NOTE> by what ca∣sualty
I know not, but much housing
was there destroyed, with all the stocks

<P>In the yeere 1503. the eighteenth of
<HI>Henry</HI> the seventh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rich. Arol.</NOTE> a request was made

<P>Please it the Lord Maior, Aldermen,

Frenchmen bringing Canvas, Linnen cloth,

bringing Wolsteds, Sayes, Stamins, Kive∣rings,
Nayles, Iron worke, or any other
wares, and also all manner Forreins, bring∣ing
Lead to the City to be sold; Shall bring
all such their wares aforesaid, to the open

else to be shewed, sold, and uttered, like as

forfeiture of all the said wares, shewed or
sold in any other place than aforesaid: And
the shew of the said wares to bee made three
dayes in a weeke, that is to say, Munday,
Tuesday, and Wednesday. It is also thought
reasonable, that the common Beame be kept
from henceforth in the <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> and
the Farmer to pay therefore reasonable rent
to the Chamber: for better it is that the
Chamber have advantage thereby, than a
forraine person. And also the said <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI>
which is more chargeable now by halfe
than profitable, shall better beare out the
charges thereof. Also the common Beame
for Wool at <HI>Leadenhall,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Common Beame to be kept in <HI>Leaden hall. Leaden hall</HI> pertai∣ning to the Com∣munalty.</NOTE> may pay yeerely a
rent to the Chamber of <HI>London,</HI> toward

occupied upon a common ground, beare a

that Forraines bringing Wools, Fels, or any

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wools, Fels, and other Mer∣chandizes to be sold in <HI>Leaden-hall.</HI></NOTE> to be kept there for the sale and Mar∣ket;

this City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bread Carts of <HI>Stratford</HI> the <HI>Bow.</HI></NOTE> either within the liberties, or
neere adjoyning. Through the which
scarcity, when the Carts of <HI>Stratford</HI>
came laden with Bread to the City (as
they had been accustomed) there was
such presse about them, that one man
was ready to destroy another, in stri∣ving
to be served for their mony. But
this scarcity lasted not long: for the
Maior (in short time) made such provi∣sion
for Wheat, that the Bakers both
of <HI>London,</HI> and of <HI>Stratford,</HI> were weary
of taking it up, and were forced to take
much more than they would, and for
the rest the Maior laid out the money
and stored it up in <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> and o∣ther
Garners of the City. This Maior
also kept the Market so well, that hee
would be at the <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> by foure a
clocke in the Summers mornings, and
from thence he went to other Markets,
to the great comfort of the Citizens.</P>
<P>I read also, that in the yeere, 1528.

appointed to view the Garners of the

Graine for the service of the City. And
because I have here before spoken of
the bread Carts comming from <HI>Strat∣ford</HI>
at the <HI>Bow,</HI> ye shall understand, that
of old time, the Bakers of bread at <HI>Strat∣ford</HI>
were allowed to bring daily (ex∣cept
the Sabbath and principall Feasts)
divers long Carts laden with bread, the
same being two ounces in the penny
wheaten loafe heavier than the penny

City. Moreover, in the 44. of <HI>Edward</HI>

<P>I read also in the 20. of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8.
Sir <HI>Iames Spencer</HI> being Maior▪ sixe Ba∣kers
of <HI>Stratford</HI> were merced in the

<P>In the yeere 1519. a petition was ex∣hibited
by the Commons to the Com∣mon
Councell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Petition of the Commons concer∣ning the use of the <HI>Leaden hall.</HI></NOTE> and was by them allow∣ed,
concerning the <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> how they
would have it used, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Meekely beseeching, sheweth unto your
good Lordship, and Masterships, divers Ci∣tizens
of this City, which (under correction)
thinke, that the great place called the <HI>Lea∣den-hall,</HI>
should nor ought not to be letten
out to farme, to any person or persons, and
in especiall, to any fellowship or company in∣corporate,
to have and hold the same Hall
for terme of yeeres, for such inconveniences
as thereby may ensue, and come to the hurt
of the Common weale of the said City in
time to come, as somewhat more largely may
appeare in the Articles following.</P>
<P>First, if any assembly, or hasty gathering
of the Commons of the said City, for sup∣pressing
or sub duing of misruled people with∣in
the said City, hereafter shall happen to
be called or commanded by the Maior, Al∣dermen
and other Governours and Counsel∣lors
of the said City for the time being;
there is none so convenient, meet and neces∣sary
a place to assemble them in, within the
said City, as the said <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> both for
largenesse of roome, and for their sure de∣fence
in time of their counselling together a∣bout
the premises. Also, in that place hath
beene used the Artillery, Guns, and other
Armors of the said City, to be safely kept in
a readinesse, for the safeguard, wealth and
defence of the said City, to be had and occu∣piedat
times when need required. As also the
store of timber, for the necessary reparations
of the tenements belonging to the Chamber of
the said City, there commonly hath beene
kept.</P>
<P>Item, if any Triumph or Noblenesse were
to be done, or shewed by the Communalty of
the City, for the honour of our Soveraigne
Lord the King, and Realme, and for the
worship of the said City: the said <HI>Leaden-hall</HI>
is the most meet and convenient place,
to prepare and order the said Triumph there∣in,
and from thence to issue forth to the pla∣ces
thereof appointed.</P>
<P>Item, at any largesse or do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of any mo∣ney,
made unto the poore people of this City;
it hath been used, to bee done and given in
the said <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> for that the said place
is most meet therefore.</P>
<P>Item,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the people to stand drie.</NOTE> the honourable Father, that was
ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r of the said Hall, had a speciall will,
intent and mind, that (as it is cōmonly said)
the Market men and women, that came to
the City with victuals and other things,
should have their free standing within the
said <HI>Leaden-hall</HI> in wet weather, to keepe
themselves and their wares dry, and there∣by
to encourage them, and all other, to have
the better will and desire, the more plenti∣ously
to resort to the said City, to victuall
the same. And if the said Hall should bee
letten to farme, the will of the said honoura∣ble
Father should never be fulfilled, nor take
effect.</P>
<P>Item, if the said place, which is the chiefe
fortresse and most necessary place within all
the City, for the tuition and safegard of the
same, should bee letten out to farme, out of
the hands of the chiefe heads of the same Ci∣ty,
and especially to any other body politike,
it might at length (by likelihood) be an oc∣casion
of discord and debate betweene the
said bodies politike, which God defend.</P>
<P>For these and many other great and rea∣sonable
causes, which hereafter shall be shew∣ed
to this honouoable Court, your said besee∣chors
thinke it much necessary, that the said
Hall bee still in the hands of this City, and
to be surely kept by sad and discreet Officers
in such wise, that it might alway be ready
to bee used and occupied, for the common
weale of the said City when need shall re∣quire,
and in no wise to be letten to any body
<PB N="166" REF="93"/>
<HI>politike.</HI> Thus much for the petition.</P>
<P>About the yeere 1534. great meanes
was made about the <HI>Leaden Hall,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Leaden Hall,</HI> meant to have been made a Burse for Mer∣chants.</NOTE> to
have the same made a Burse for the As∣sembly
of Merchants, as they had been
accustomed in <HI>Lumbard-street:</HI> many
Common Councels were called to that
end but in the yeere 1535. <HI>Iohn Champ∣neis</HI>
being Maior, it was fully concluded,
that the Burse should remaine in <HI>Lum∣bard-street,</HI>
as afore, and <HI>Leaden Hall</HI> no
more to be spoken of concerning that
matter.</P>
<P>The use of <HI>Leaden Hall</HI> in my youth
was thus: In a part of the North Qua∣drant,
on the East side of the North
gate, were the common beames, for
weighing of Wooll and other Wares,
as had been accustomed: On the West
side of the gate was the Scales to weigh
meale: the other three sides were reser∣ved
(for the most part) to the making
and resting of the Pageants shewed at
Midsummer in the watch: the remnant
of the sides &amp; Quadrāts were imployed
for the stowage of Woolsacks, but not
closed up: the lofts above were partly
used by the Painters, in working for the
decking of Pageants and other devices,
for beautifying of the Watch and
Watch-men, the residue of the lofts
were letten out to Merchants, the
Wool-winders and Packers therein to
winde and packe their Wools. And
thus much for <HI>Leaden-hall</HI> may suffice.</P>
<P>Now on the North of <HI>Limestreet</HI>
Ward, in the high street are divers faire
houses for Merchants, and proper tene∣ments
for Artificers, with an Alley also
called <HI>Shaft Alley,</HI> of the Shaft or May-pole
sometime resting over the gate
thereof, as I have declared in <HI>Ealdgate</HI>
Ward.</P>
<P>In the yeere 1576. partly at the char∣ges
of the parish of S. <HI>Andrew,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Pumpe in the high street of <HI>Lime-street</HI> Ward.</NOTE> and partly
at the charges of the Chamber of <HI>Lond.</HI>
a water-Pumpe was raised in the high
street of <HI>Limestreet</HI> Ward,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cornchill</HI> street in some place raised two fadome higher than of old time, as appea∣red by buildines found so deepe.</NOTE> neere unto
<HI>Limestreet</HI> corner: for the placing of the
which Pumpe, having broken up the
ground, they were forced to digge more
than two fadome deepe, before they
came to any maine ground, where they
found a Harth made of <HI>Britaine,</HI> or ra∣ther
<HI>Roman</HI> Tile, every Tile halfe yard
square, and about two inches thicke:
they found Coale lying there also (for
that lying whole will never consume)
then digging one fadome in the maine,
they found water sufficient, made their
prall, and set up the Pumpe, which
Pumpe, with o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> repairing and great
charges to the parish, continued not 24.
yeeres, but being rotted, was taken up,
and a new set in the place, in the yeere
1600. Thus much for the high street.</P>
<P>In Saint <HI>Mary</HI> street had yee (of old
time) a parish Church of Saint <HI>Mary</HI>
the Virgin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. <HI>Mary</HI> street Pa∣rish Church of <HI>Mary,</HI> St. <HI>Vrsula,</HI> and 11000. Virgins, called at the Axe, letten out of a ware∣house.</NOTE> St. <HI>Vrsula,</HI> and the 11000.
Virgins, which Church was common∣ly
called Saint <HI>Mary</HI> at the Axe, of the
signe of an Axe, over against the East
end thereof, or Saint <HI>Mary Pellipar,</HI> of
a plot of ground lying on the North side
thereof, pertaining to the Skinners in
<HI>London.</HI> This parish about the yeere,
1565. was united to the parish Church
of Saint <HI>Andrew Vndershaft,</HI> and so was
Saint <HI>Mary</HI> at the Axe suppressed, and
letten out to be a warehouse for a Mer∣chant.
Against the East end of this
Church, was sometime a faire wall, now
turned to a pumpe. Also against the
North end of this St. <HI>Mary</HI> street, was
sometime one other parish Church of
Saint <HI>Augustine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parish Church of S. <HI>Augu∣stine</HI> in the wall, made a Chappel to the <HI>Pa∣pey,</HI> and since pul∣led downe and made a stable.</NOTE> called Saint <HI>Augustine</HI>
in the wall, for that it stood adjoyning
to the wall of the City, and otherwise
called Saint <HI>Augustines Papey,</HI> or the
Poore, as I have read in the reigne of
<HI>Edward</HI> the 3. About the yeere, 1430.
in the reigne of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixt, the same
Church was allowed to the brethren of
the <HI>Papey,</HI> the house of poore Priests,
wherof I have spoken in <HI>Ealdgate</HI> Ward.
The Parishioners of this Church were
appointed to the Parish Church of <HI>Al∣hallowes</HI>
in the wall, which is in <HI>Broad∣street</HI>
Ward: and this brotherhood cal∣led
<HI>Papey,</HI> being suppressed, the Church
of Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> was pulled downe,
and in place thereof one <HI>Grey,</HI> Apothe∣cary,
builded a Stable, a Hay-loft, &amp;c.
It is now a dwelling house. Those two
Parish Churches, both lying in the
Ward of <HI>Limestreet,</HI> being thus suppres∣sed,
there is not any one parish Church
or place for Divine Service in that
Ward, but the inhabitants thereof re∣paire
to Saint <HI>Peter</HI> in <HI>Corne-hill</HI> Ward,
Saint <HI>Andrew</HI> in <HI>Ealdgate</HI> Ward, <HI>Al∣hallowes</HI>
in the wall, in <HI>Broadstreet</HI> Ward,
<PB N="167" REF="93"/>
and some to Saint <HI>Dennis</HI> in <HI>Langbourne</HI>
Ward.</P>
<P>Now because of late there hath been
some question, to what Ward this
Church of S. <HI>Augustine Papey</HI> should
of right belong; for the same hath been
challenged by them of <HI>Ealdgate</HI> Ward,
and (without reason) taken into <HI>Bishops∣gate</HI>
Ward, from <HI>Limestreet</HI> VVard, I
am somewhat to touch it.</P>
<P>About thirty yeeres since,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Houses by <HI>London</HI> wall in the ward of <HI>Limestreet.</HI></NOTE> the Cham∣ber
of <HI>London</HI> granted a Lease of ground
(in these words) <HI>Lying neere</HI> London
<HI>Wall, in the Ward of</HI> Limestreet, <HI>from the
West of the said Church or Chappell of Saint</HI>
Augustine Papey, <HI>towards</HI> Bishopsgate,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> On the which plot of ground, the
Leasee builded three faire tenements,
and placed Tenants there: these were
charged to beare scot and lot, and some∣of
them to beare office in <HI>Limestreet</HI>
VVard: all which they did willingly
without grudging. And when any sus∣pected
or disordered persons were by
the Landlord placed there, the Officers
of <HI>Limestreet</HI> VVard fetched them out
of their houses, committed them to
ward, procured their due punishments,
and banished them from thence: wher∣by
in short time that place was refor∣med,
and brought into good order:
which thing being noted by them of
<HI>Ealdgate</HI> VVard, they moved their Al∣derman,
Sir <HI>Thomas Offley,</HI> to call in
those houses to be of his VVard. But I

<P>On the South side of this street, stret∣ching

Kings streete on the West to the Bi∣shops
of <HI>Londons</HI> field, called <HI>Lollesworth</HI>
on the East. The Prior of this Saint <HI>Ma∣ry</HI>
Spittle, for the emortising and pro∣priation
of the Priory of <HI>Bikenacar</HI> in
<HI>Essex,</HI> to his said house of S. <HI>Mary</HI> Spit∣tle,
gave to <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh 400. <ABBR>l.</ABBR>
in the two and twentieth of his reigne.
This Hospitall surrendred to <HI>Henry</HI> the
eighth, was valued to dispend 478. <ABBR>l.</ABBR>
wherein was found, besides ornaments
of the Church, and other goods pertai∣ning
to the Hospitall, 180. beds well
furnished, for receipt of the poore: for
it was an Hospitall of great reliefe. Sir
<HI>Henry Plesington,</HI> Knight, was buried
there, 1452.</P>
<P>In place of this Hospitall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pulpit Crosse at the <HI>Spittle.</HI></NOTE> and neere
adjoyning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charnell and Chap∣pell of S. <HI>Edmond</HI> and of <HI>Mary Magdalen.</HI></NOTE> are now many faire houses
builded, for receipt and lodging of wor∣shipfull
persons. A part of the large
Church-yard pertaining to this Hospi∣tall,
and severed from the rest with a
Brick wall, yet remaineth as of old time,
with a Pulpit Crosse therein,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sermons in the Ea∣ster holy∣dayes at the <HI>Spittle.</HI></NOTE> somewhat
like to that in <HI>Pauls</HI> Church-yard. And
against the said Pulpit on the South side
before the Charnell and Chappell of
Saint <HI>Edmond</HI> the Bishop, and <HI>Mary
Magdalen,</HI> which Chappell was foun∣ded
about the yeere 1391. by <HI>W. Eue∣sham,</HI>
Citizen and Peperer of <HI>London,</HI>
who was there buried; remaineth also
one faire builded house of two stories in
height for the Maior, and other hono∣rable
persons, with the Aldermen and
Sheriffes to sit in, there to heare the
Sermons preached in the Easter holy∣dayes.
In the Loft over them stood the
Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> and other Prelates;
but now the Ladies, and Aldermens
Wives doe there stand at a faire Win∣dow,
or sit at their pleasure.</P>
<P>And here is to bee noted, that time
out of minde, it hath beene a laudable
custome, that on good Fryday in the af∣ter-noone,
some especiall learned man,
by appointment of the Prelates, hath
preached a Sermon at <HI>Pauls</HI> Crosse,
treating of Christs passion: and upon
the three next Easter Holydayes, Mun∣day,
Tuesday, and Wednesday, the like
learned men, by the like appointment,
have used to preach on the forenoones
at the said Spittle, to perswade the Ar∣ticle
of Christs resurection: and then
on Low Sunday, one other learned man
at <HI>Pauls</HI> Crosse, to make rehearsall of
those foure former Sermons, either
commending or reproouing them, as to
him (by iudgement of the learned Di∣vines)
was thought convenient. And
that done, he was to make a Sermon of
his owne studie, which in all were fiue
Sermons in one. At these Sermons so
severally preached, the Maior with his
Brethren the Aldermen were accusto∣med
to bee present in their Violets at
<HI>Pauls</HI> on good Fryday, and in their
Scarlets at the Spittle in the Holydaies,
except Wednesday, in Violet, and the
Maior with his Brethren on Low Sun∣day
in Scarlet, at <HI>Pauls</HI> Crosse, continu∣ed
untill this day.</P>
<P>Touching the Antiquity of this
Custome, I find that in the yeere 1398.
King <HI>Richard</HI> having procured from
<HI>Rome,</HI> confirmation of such statutes, and
ordinances, as were made in the Parlia∣ment,
begun at <HI>Westminster,</HI> and ended
at <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> he caused the same con∣firmation
to be read and pronounced at
<HI>Pauls</HI> Crosse and at Saint <HI>Mary</HI> Spittle,
in the Sermons before all the people.
<HI>Philip Malpas</HI> one of the Sheriffes in
the yeere 1439. gave 20. shillings by the
yeere to the three Preachers at the Spit∣le.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">House in S. <HI>Mary Spittle</HI> Church-yard builded for the Maior and Aldermen Pulpit Crosse in <HI>Spittle</HI> Church-yard new builded.</NOTE> <HI>Stephen Forstor</HI> Maior in the yeere
1594. gave forty pounds to the Prea∣chers
of <HI>Pauls</HI> Crosse and Spittle. I
finde also, that the aforesaid house,
wherein the Maior and Aldermen doe
sit at the Spittle, was builded (for that
purpose) or the goods, and by the exe∣cutors
of <HI>Rich. Rawson</HI> Alderman, and
<HI>Isabel</HI> his wife, in the yeere 1488. In the
yeere 1594. this Pulpit being old, was
taken downe, and a new one set up, the
Preachers face turned towards the
South, which was before toward the
West. Also a large house (on the East
<PB N="177" REF="98"/>
side of the said Pulpit) was then buil∣ded,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A house in <HI>Spittle</HI> Church-yard buil∣ded for the Gover∣ners and Children of Christs Hospitall.</NOTE> for the Governours and Children
of Christs Hospitall to sit in: and this
was done of the goods of <HI>William Elkin</HI>
Alderman, late deceased. But within the
first yeere, the same house decaying,
and like to have fallen, was againe (with
great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost) repaired at the Cities charge.</P>
<P>Here I may not omit an especiall mat∣ter,
because in my remebrance, nor
else (in my reading) I finde not the
like. On Munday in Easter weeke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">On Mun∣day in Ea∣ster week, <HI>An. Dom. 1617.</HI> A Saint <HI>Ma∣ry Spittle.</HI></NOTE> be∣ing
<HI>April 21. 1617.</HI> our most Gracious

Lords and other of his Majesties
most Honourable Privie Councell, to

and there to remaine in company (du∣ring
the Sermon time) with the Lord
Maior, Sir <HI>Iohn Lemman,</HI> and his wor∣thy
Brethren the Aldermen of this City.
The Sermon being ended, they rode
home with the Lord Maior to his house
neere <HI>Belingsgate,</HI> where they were loving∣ly
and honourably both welcommed
and entertained with a most liberall and
bountifull Dinner, and all the Gentle∣men
attending on them. The Lords,

<HI>Detford</HI> in <HI>Kent.</HI></P>
<P>On the East side of this Churchyard ly∣eth
a large field,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lolesworth field.</NOTE> of old time called <HI>Loles∣worth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Buriall of the <HI>Romans</HI> in <HI>Spittle field.</HI></NOTE> now <HI>Spittle field,</HI> which about the
yeere 1576. was broken up for Clay to
make Bricke: in the digging thereof
many earther pots called <HI>Vrnae,</HI> were
found full of Ashes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Old Mo∣numents of the <HI>Ro∣manes</HI> found.</NOTE> and burnt bones of
men, to wit of the <HI>Romans</HI> that inhabi∣ted
here. For it was the custome of the
<HI>Romans,</HI> to burne their dead, to put their
Ashes in an Vrne, and then bury the
same with certain Ceremonies, in some
field appointed for that purpose neere
unto their City.</P>
<P>Every of these pots had in them (with
the Ashes of the dead) one piece of
Copper money, with the inscription of
the Emperour then reigning: some of
them were of <HI>Claudius,</HI> some of <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spasian,</HI>
some of <HI>Nere,</HI> of <HI>Antoninus Pius,</HI> of <HI>Tra∣janus,</HI>
and others. Besides those Vrnes,
many other pots were found in the same
place, made of a white earth, with long
necks, and handles, like to our stone
Jugs: these were empty, but seemed
to be buried full of some liquid matter,
long since consumed and soked through.
For there were found divers Vials, and
other fashioned Glasses, some most cun∣ningly
wrought, such as I have not seen
the like, and some of Chrystall, all
which had water in them, nothing dif∣fering
in clearnesse, taste, or savour from
common spring water; whatsoever it
was at the first. Some of these Glasses
had Oyle in them very thick, and earth∣ly
in savour. Some were supposed to
have Balme in them, but had lost the
vertue: many of these pots and Glasses
were broken in cutting of the Clay, so
that few were taken up whole.</P>
<P>There were also found divers Dishes
and Cups, of a fine red coloured earth,
which shewed outwardly such a shining
smoothnesse, as if they had been of Cur∣rall.
Those had (in the bottomes) <HI>Ro∣man</HI>
letters printed, there were also
Lampes of white earth and red, artifi∣cially
wrought with divers Antiques a∣bout
them, some three or foure Images,
made of white earth, about a span long
each of them: one I remember was of
<HI>Pallas,</HI> the rest I have forgotten. I my
selfe have reserved (amongst divers of
those antiquities there) one Vrne, with
the Ashes and bones, and one pot of
white earth very small, not exceeding
the quantity of a quarter of a wine pint,
made in shape of a Hare, squatted upon
her legs, and betweene her eares is the
mouth of the por.</P>
<P>There hath also been found (in the
same field) divers Coffins of stone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Troughs of Stone found in the <HI>Spittle</HI> field.</NOTE> con∣taining
the bones of men: these I sup∣pose
to bee the burials of some speciall
persons, in time of the <HI>Brittons,</HI> or <HI>Sax∣ons,</HI>
after that the <HI>Romans</HI> had left to go∣verne
here. Moreover, there were also
found the scuis and bones of men, with∣out
Coffins, or rather whose Coffins
<PB N="178" REF="99"/>
(being of great timber) were consumed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Nayles of Irō found in the field and fond opinions of men.</NOTE>
Divers great Nayles of Iron were there
found, such as are used in the Wheeles
of shod Carts, being each of them as
big as a mans finger, and a quarter of a
yard long, the heads two inches over.
Those Nayles were more wondred at
than the rest of the things there sound,
and many opinions of men were there
uttered of them, namely, that the men
there buried, were murthered by dri∣ving
those Nayles into their heads; a
thing unlikely: for a smaller Nayle
would more aptly serve to so bad a pur∣pose,
and a more secret place would
lightly be employed for such buriall.</P>
<P>But to set downe what I have obser∣ved
concerning this matter, I there be∣held
the bones of a man lying (as I no∣ted)
the head North, the feet South,
and round about him (as thwart his
head, along both his sides, and thwart
his feet) such Nayles were found. Wher∣fore
I conjectured them to be the nayles
of his Coffin, which had been a trough,
cut out of some great tree, and the same
covered with a planke of a great thick∣nesse,
fastened with such Nayles, and
therfore I caused some of the Nayles to
be reached up to me; and found under
the broad heads of them, the old wood,
skant turned into earth, but still retai∣ning
both the graine and proper colour.
Of these Nayles (with the wood under
the head thereof) I reserved one, as al∣so
the nether jaw-bone of the man, the
teeth being great, sound, and fixed,
which (amongst many other Monu∣ments
there found) I have yet to shew;
but the Nayle lying dry, is by scaling
greatly wasted. And thus much for this
part of <HI>Bishopsgate</HI> Ward, without the
Gate: for I have in another place spo∣ken
of the Gate, and therefore I am to
speake of that other part of this Ward,
which lyeth within the Gate.</P>
<P>And first to begin on the left hand of
<HI>Bishopsgate</HI> street,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarkes Hall and their alms∣houses in <HI>Bishopsgate</HI> street.</NOTE> from the Gate ye have
certaine Tenements of old time pertai∣ning
to a brotherhood of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI>
granted to the Parish Clarkes of <HI>London</HI>
for two Chaplens to bee kept in the
Chappell of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> neere
unto the <HI>Guild hall</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> in the 27.
of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth. The first of these
house towards the North, and against
the Wall of the City, was sometime a
large Inne or Court, called the <HI>Wrastlers</HI>
of such a signe, and the last in the high
street towards the South, was sometime
also a faire Inne called the <HI>Angel,</HI> of such
a signe. Amongst these said Tenements
was (on the same street side) a faire En∣try
or Court to the common Hall of the
said Parish Clarks, with proper Almes-houses,
seven in number, adjoyning, for
Parish Clarkes, and their Wives, their
Widdowes, such as were in great yeeres
not able to labour. One of these, by the
said Brotherhood of Parish Clarkes,
was allowed sixteene pence the weeke,
the other sixe had each of them nine
pence the weeke, according to the Pa∣tent
thereof granted. This Brotherhood
(amongst other) being suppressed: In
the reigne of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, the said
Hall with the other buildings there, was
given to Sir <HI>Robert Chester,</HI> a Knight of
<HI>Cambridge-shire,</HI> against whom the Pa∣rish
Clarkes commencing sute, in the
reigne of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and being like to
have prevailed, the said Sir <HI>Robert Che∣ster</HI>
pulled down the Hall, sold the tim∣ber,
stone and lead, and thereupon the
sute was ended. The Almes-houses re∣mained
in the Queenes hands, and peo∣ple
were there placed, such as could
make best friends. Some of them ta∣king
the pension appointed, have let
forth their houses for great rent, giving
occasion to the Parson of the Parish, to
challenge tithes of the poore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Next unto this is the small Parish
Church of Saint <HI>Ethelburge,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parish Church of S. <HI>Ethel∣biage.</HI></NOTE> Virgin, and
from thence some small distance is a

seven Almes-roomes or houses for the

much beloved in their lives, and more
lamented at their deaths; especially by
the poore, to whom their good deeds (being
alive) begot many prayers, now (being
dead, many teares. The Glaffe of his life
held 70. yeeres and then ranne out. To
live long, and happy, is an honour; but
to dye happy, a greater glory: Both these
aspired to both. Heaven (no doubt)

nine yeeres, from the yeere 1466. unto
the yeere 1565. for the annuall rent of
eleven pounds six shillings eight pence.
This house hee builded of stone and
timber, very large and beautifull, and
the highest at that time in <HI>London:</HI> hee
was one of the Sheriffes, and an Alder∣man
in the yeere 1470. knighted by

gave 20. pounds towards the convey∣ance
of more water thereto. From this

and houses of learning.</P>
<P>Somewhat West from this house, is
one other faire house, wherein Sir <HI>Wil∣liam

<P>On the South side, and at the West
end of this Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Throkmor∣ton</HI> street.</NOTE> many faire houses
are builded, namely in <HI>Throkmorton</HI>
street, one very large and spacious, buil∣ded
in the place of old and small tene∣ments,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">T. <HI>Cromwell</HI> his house.</NOTE> by <HI>Thomas Cromwell,</HI> Master of
the Kings Jewell-house; after that, Ma∣ster
of the Rolls, then Lord <HI>Cromwell,</HI>
Knight, Lord Privie Seale, Vicar gene∣rall,
Earle of <HI>Essex,</HI> high Chamberlain
of <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c. This house being fini∣shed,
and having some reasonable plot
of ground left for a Garden, hee caused
the pales of the Gardens adjoyning to
the North part thereof, on a sudden to
be taken downe, 22. foot to be measu∣red
forth-right into the North of every
mans ground, a line there to be drawn,
a trench to be cast, a foundation laid,
and an high bricke wall to be builded.
My Father had a Garden there, &amp; there
was a house standing close to his South
pale: this house they loosed from the
ground, and bare upon Rowlers into my
Fathers Garden 22. foot, ere my Father
heard thereof: no warning was given
him, nor other answer, (when he spake
to the surveyers of that worke) but that
their Master, Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> commanded
them so to doe: no man durst goe to
argue the matter, but each man lost his
Land; and my Father paid his whole
rent, which was 6. shillings 8. pence
the yeere, for that halfe which was left.
Thus much of mine owne knowledge
have I thought good to note, that the
sudden rising of some men, causeth
them to forget themselves.</P>
<P>The Company of Drapers in <HI>London</HI>
bought this house,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dra∣pers hall.</NOTE> and now the same is
their common Hall. This Company
obtained of King <HI>Henry</HI> the 6. in the
seventeenth of his reigne, to bee in∣corporate;
<HI>Iohn Gedney</HI> was chosen to
be their first Master; and the 4. War∣dens
were, <HI>1. VVotton, I. Darby, Robert
Breton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dra∣pers Armes.</NOTE> and <HI>T. Cooke.</HI> The Armes gran∣ted
to the said Company, by Sir <HI>VVil∣liam
Bridges,</HI> Knight, first <HI>Garter</HI> King
at Armes, in Blason are thus: Three Sun
Beames, issuing out of three clouds of
flame, crowned with three Crownes
Imperials of gold, upon a shield Azure.</P>
<P>From this Hall, on the same side,

<P>The 21. of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, <HI>Tho∣mas

great Merchants, and had frequented
all sorts of merchandises into most parts
of the world, to the honour of the Kings
Realme, and to the great profit of his
subjects, and of his Progenitors, and the
men of the said mystery, (during the

As they both (thankes be to God) lived

well, by the onely mercy of Iesus Christ.</P></Q>

It was founded in the Parish of Saint
<HI>Bennet Finke,</HI> for a Master, two Priests,
one Schoole-master, and twelve poore
men: after which foundation, amongst
other things, was given to this Hospitall
one Message and Garden, whereon

<P>In the yeere 1474. <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth
granted to <HI>William Say,</HI> Batcheler of Di∣vinity,
Master of the said Hospitall, to

unto the Collegiate of Saint <HI>George</HI> in
<HI>VVindsor.</HI></P>
<P>The Protectors of this house were to
collect the benevolence of charitable
persons, towards the building and sup∣porting
thereof. And amongst other
things observed in my youth, I remem∣ber,
that the Officers (charged with o∣versight
of the Markets in this City)
did divers time take from the Market
people, Pigs starved, or otherwise un∣wholsome
for mans sustenance: these
they did slit in the eare.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saint <HI>Anthonies</HI> Pigs fed on the dunghils.</NOTE> One of the
Proctors for St. <HI>Anthonies</HI> tyed a Bell
about the necke, and let it feed on the
Dunghils, no man would hurt, or take
it up: but if any gave to them bread, or
other feeding, such would they know,
watch for, and daily follow, whining
till they had somewhat given them:
whereupon was raised a Proverbe, <HI>Such
an one wil follow such an one, &amp; whine as it
were an</HI> Anthonie <HI>Pig:</HI> but if such a Pig
grew to be fat, and came to good liking
(as oft times they did) then the Proctor
would take him up to the use of the
Hospitall.</P>
<P>In the yeere, 1499. Sir <HI>Iohn Tate,</HI>
sometime Alebrewer, then a Mercer,
caused his Brewhouse, called the <HI>Swan</HI>

College, or Hospitall of Saint
<HI>Anthony,</HI> to bee taken for the enlarging
of the Church, which was then newly
builded; toward the building whereof,
the said <HI>Tate</HI> gave great summes of mo∣ney,

VVARD.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He next Ward to∣wards
the South,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cornehill</HI> Ward.</NOTE> is
<HI>Cornehill</HI> VVard:
so called of a Corn∣market,
time out of
mind there holden,
and is a part of the
principall high street, beginning at the
West end of <HI>Leaden Hall,</HI> stretching
downe West on both the sides, by the
South end of <HI>Finkes lane</HI> on the right
hand, and by the North end of <HI>Bircho∣vers
lane,</HI> on the left part; of which
lanes, to wit, to the middle of them, is
of this Ward, and so downe to the
<HI>Stockes</HI> Market; and this is the bounds.
The upper or East part of this Ward,
and also a part of <HI>Limestreet</HI> Ward, hath
beene (as I said) a Market-place, especi∣ally
for corne, and since for all kinde of
victuals, as is partly shewed in <HI>Lime-street</HI>
Ward.</P>
<P>It appeareth of record, that in the
yeere 1522. the Rippiers of <HI>Rie</HI> and o∣ther
places, sold their fresh Fish in <HI>Lea∣den
Hall</HI> Market, upon <HI>Cornehill;</HI> but
forraigne Butchers were not admitted
there to sell flesh, till the yeere 1533.</P>
<P>And it was enacted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flesh Market at <HI>Leaden hall,</HI> and alte∣ration of prises in short time.</NOTE> that Butchers
should sell their Biefe not above a halfe
penny the pound; and Mutton, halfe
penny, halfe farthing: which act being
devised for the great commodity of the
Realme, (as it was then thought) hath
since proved farre otherwise: For before
that time, a fat Oxe was sold at <HI>London,</HI>
for 26. <HI>s. 8. <ABBR>d.</ABBR></HI> at the most: a fat Wea∣ther
for 3. <HI>s. 4. <ABBR>d.</ABBR></HI> a fat Calfe the same
price; a fat Lambe for 12. <HI><ABBR>d.</ABBR></HI> pieces of
Biefe weighed two pounds and a halfe
at the least; yea, three pound or better,
for a penny, on every Butchers stall in
this Citie; and of those pieces of Biefe,
thirteene or foureteen for twelve pence:
fat Mutton for eight pence the quarter,
and one hundred weight of Biefe for 4.
<HI>s. 8. <ABBR>d.</ABBR></HI> at the dearest.</P>
<P>What the price is now, I neede not
to set downe: many men thought the
same act to rise in price, by reason that
Grasiers knew or supposed what weight
every their beasts contained, and so rai∣sing
their price thereafter, the Butcher
could be no gainer, but by likewise rai∣sing
his price. The number of Butchers
then in the Citie and Suburbs, was ac∣counted
sixe score, of which every one
killed 6. Oxen a peece weekely: which
is in 46. weekes, 33120. Oxen, or 720.
Oxen weekely.</P>
<P>The forraigne Butchers (for a long
time) stood in the high street of <HI>Lime-street</HI>
Ward, on the North side, twice
every weeke; <HI>viz.</HI> Wednesday and Sa∣turday,
and were some gaine to the Te∣nants,
before whose doores they stood,
and into whose houses they set their
blockes and stalles: but that advantage
being espied, they were taken into <HI>Lea∣den
Hall,</HI> there to pay for their standing
to the Chamber of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Thus much for the Market upon
<HI>Cornehill.</HI></P>
<P>The chiefe Ornaments in <HI>Cornehill</HI>
Ward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Standard of <HI>Thames</HI> water by <HI>Leaden hall</HI></NOTE> are these: First, at the East end
thereof, in the middle of the high street,

made an artificiall Forcier for that pur∣pose,
conveyed <HI>Thames</HI> water in pipes
of lead, over the steeple of Saint <HI>Mag∣nus</HI>

Bridge, and from thence into divers
mens houses in <HI>Thames</HI> street, new <HI>Fish-street,</HI>

the Chanels of the street toward <HI>Bishops-gate,

Market; but now no such matter, whose
default I know not.</P>
<P>Then have ye a faire Conduit, of
sweet water, castellated in the midst of
that Ward and street. This Conduit
was first builded of stone, in the yeere

brake up this prison called the <HI>Tunne,</HI>
and tooke out certaine prisoners, for
the which they were sharply punished,
by long imprisonment, and great fines.
It cost the Citizens (as some have writ∣ten)
more than 20000.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tho Wal∣singham.</NOTE> Markes, which
they were amerced in, before <HI>William

<P>Also,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Citizens of <HI>London</HI> punished fornicatiō and adul∣tery in Priests and other, without partiality.</NOTE> that in the yeere 1383. the se∣venth

forth to the sight of the World, they
caused their heads to be shaven, after
the manner of Theeves, whom they na∣med
<HI>Appellators,</HI> and so to be led about
the Citie, in sight of all the inhabitants,
with Trumpets and Pipes sounding be∣fore
them, that their persons might be
the more largely knowne: Neither did
they spare such kind of men a whit the
more, but used them as hardly, saying;
They abhorred not only the negligence
of their Prelates, but also detested their
avarice, that studied for money, omit∣ted
the punishment limited by Law,
and permitted those that were found
guilty, to live favourably by their fines.
Wherefore they would themselves,
they said, purge their Citie from such
filthinesse, lest through Gods venge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ance,
either the Pestilence or Sword
should happen to them, or that the

to be noted, I reade in the charge of the

<HI>Iohn Atwod,</HI> Draper, dwelling in the

directly against the Church, having a
proper woman to his wife, such an one
as seemed the holiest amongst a thou∣sand,
had also a lusty Chauntry Priest
of the said Parish Church, repairing to
his house, with the which Priest, the
said <HI>Atwod</HI> would sometime after sup∣per
play a game at Tables for a pint of
Ale. It chanced on a time, having haste
of worke, and his game proving long, he
left his wife to play it out, and went
downe to his shop: but returning to
fetch a pressing-iron, he found such play
(to his misliking) that hee forced the
Priest to leap out at a window, over the
Penthouse into the street, and so to run
to his lodging in the Church-yard. <HI>At∣wod</HI>
and his wife were soone reconciled,
so that he would not suffer her to be cal∣led
in question;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Priest punished for leche∣rie.</NOTE> but the Priest being
apprehended and committed, I saw his
punishment to be thus: He was on three
Market dayes conveyed thorow the
high street and Markets of the Citie,
with a paper on his head, wherein was
written his trespasse. The first day hee
rode in a Carry; the second, on a horse,
his face to the horse taile; the third, led
betwixt twaine, and every day rung
with Basons, and proclamations made
of his fact at every turning of the streets,
and also before <HI>Iohn Atwods</HI> Stall, and

purchased by the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI>
for more than 3532. pounds, and were
sold for 478. pounds, to such persons as
should take them downe, and carry
them thence; also the ground or plot
was made plaine at the charges of the
Citie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Citie charged with buil∣dings of the <HI>Burse.</HI></NOTE> and then possession thereof was
by certaine Aldermen (in name of the
whole Citizens) given to Sir <HI>Thomas
Gresham,</HI> Knight, agent to the Queens
Highnesse, there-upon to build a
Burse, or place for Merchants to assem∣ble
in, at his owne proper charges: and
hee, on the seventh of <HI>Iune,</HI> laying the
first stone of the foundation, beeing
Bricke, accompanied with some Alder∣men,
every of them laid a piece of gold,
which the workemen tooke up, and
forthwith followed upon the same such
diligence, that by the moneth of <HI>No∣vember,</HI>
in the yeere 1567. the same was
covered with slate, and shortly after
fully finished.</P>
<P>In the yeere 1570. on the 23. of <HI>Ia∣nuary,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Queene <HI>Elizabeth</HI> came to the <HI>Burse.</HI></NOTE> the Queenes Majestie, attended
with her Nobility, came from her house
at the Strand, called <HI>Sommerset House,</HI>
and entred the Citie by Temple-Barre,
through <HI>Fleet-street, Cheape,</HI> and so by
the North side of the <HI>Burse,</HI> through
<HI>Three-needle street,</HI> to Sir <HI>Thomas Gres∣hams</HI>
house in <HI>Bishopsgate</HI> street, where
she dined. After dinner, her Majestie
returning through <HI>Cornehill,</HI> entred the
<HI>Burse</HI> on the South side, and after shee
had viewed every part thereof above
the ground; especially the <HI>Pawne,</HI> which
was richly furnished with all sorts of
the finest wares in the Citie: she caused
the same <HI>Burse,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Burse</HI> called the <HI>Royall Exchange.</HI></NOTE> by an Herauld and a
Trumpet, to be proclaimed the <HI>Royall
Exchange,</HI> and so to bee called from
thence-forth, and not otherwise.</P>
<P>Next adjoyning to this <HI>Royall Ex∣change,</HI>
remaineth one part of a large
stone house, and is now called the <HI>Castle,</HI>
of such a signe at a Taverne doore; there
is a passage thorow out of <HI>Cornehill</HI> into
<HI>Three-needle</HI> street: the other part of the
said stone house was taken downe, for
enlarging the <HI>Royall Exchange.</HI> This
stone house was said of some to have bin
a Church, whereof it had no proporti∣on.
Of others, a Iewes house, as though
none but Iewes had dwelt in stone
houses: but that opinion is without
warrant.</P>
<P>For beside the strong building of stone
houses, against invasion of theeves in the
night, when no watches were kept: In
the first yeere of <HI>Richard</HI> the first, (to
prevent the casualties of fire, which of∣ten
had hapned in the Citie, when the
houses were builded of timber, and co∣vered
with Reed or straw,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cause of stone houses builded in <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Henry Fitz
Alwine</HI> being Maior) it was decreed,
that from thenceforth, no man should
build within the Citie, but of stone,
untill a certaine heighth, and to cover
the same building with slate, or burnt
tile. This was the very cause of such
<PB N="210" REF="115"/>
stone buildings, whereof many have re∣mained
till our time, that for gaining
of ground they have been taken down,
and in place of some one of them, being
low (as but 2. stories above the ground)
many houses of 4. or 5. stories high are
placed.</P>
<P>From this stone house downe to the
<HI>Stockes,</HI> are divers large houses, especi∣ally
for height, for Merchants and Ar∣tificers.</P>
<P>On the South side of this high street,
is the Parish Church of Saint <HI>Peter</HI> up∣on
<HI>Cornehill,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parish Church of S. <HI>Peter</HI> upon <HI>Cornhill.</HI></NOTE> which seemeth to be of an
ancient building, but not so ancient as
fame reporteth; for it hath beene lately
repaired, if not all new builded, except
the steeple, which is ancient.</P>
<P>The roofe of this Church, and glasing,
was finished in the reigne of <HI>Edward</HI> the
fourth, as appeareth by Armes of No∣blemen,
and Aldermen of <HI>London</HI> then
living. There remaineth in this Church
a Table, wherein it is written, I know not
by what authority, but of no late hand;
that King <HI>Lucius</HI> founded the same
Church, to bee an Archbishops Sea,
Metropolitane and chiefe Church of
his Kingdome, and that it so endured
the space of foure hundred yeeres, unto
the comming of <HI>Augustine</HI> the Monke.</P>
<P>Now, because many have urged it
very earnestly to me, to let them be fur∣ther
acquainted therewith: I have here
inserted the same <HI>verbatim,</HI> as it is there
recorded in the Table.</P>

<HEAD>A Copie taken out of the Table,

<P>BE it knowne unto all men, that the

Lucius,</HI> the first Christian King of
this Land, then called <HI>Brytaine,</HI> founded
the first Church in <HI>London,</HI> that is to say,
the Church of Saint <HI>Peter</HI> upon <HI>Cornhill.</HI>
And he founded there an Arch-bishops See,
and made that Church the Metropolitane
and chiefe Church of this Kingdome: and
so endured the space of <HI>CCCC.</HI> yeeres,
unto the comming of S. <HI>Austin,</HI> the Apostle
of <HI>England,</HI> the which was sent into this
Land by S. <HI>Gregory,</HI> the Doctor of the
Church, in the time of King <HI>Ethelbert.</HI>
And then was the Archbishops See and Pall
removed from the foresaid Church of Saint
<HI>Peter</HI> upon <HI>Cornehill,</HI> unto <HI>Dereberni∣am,</HI>
that now is called <HI>Canturbury,</HI> and

S. <HI>Austen,</HI> was made the first Bishop of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
&amp; his See was made in <HI>Pauls</HI> Church.
And this <HI>Lucius</HI> King, was the first foun∣der
of Saint <HI>Peters</HI> Church upon <HI>Corne∣hill.</HI>
And he reigned in this Land after

more at large, hath these very words:</P>
<P>There is a Controversie (faith hee)
moved among our Historiographers,
whether the Church that <HI>Lucius</HI> buil∣ded
at <HI>London,</HI> stood at <HI>Westminster,</HI> or
in <HI>Cornehill.</HI> For, there is some cause,
why the Metropolitane Church should
be thought to stand where Saint <HI>Peters</HI>
now doth, by the space of foure hundred
and odde yeeres, before it was removed
to <HI>Canturbury</HI> by <HI>Austin</HI> the Monke, if a
man would leane to one side, without
any conference of the asseverations of
the other. But herein (as I take it) there
lurketh some scruple: for, beside that S.
<HI>Peters</HI> Church stood in the East end of
the Citie, and that of <HI>Apollo</HI> in the west,
the word <HI>Cornehill,</HI> a denomination gi∣ven
of late (to speake of) to one street,
may easily be mistaken for <HI>Thorney.</HI></P>
<P>For, as the word <HI>Thorney</HI> proceedeth
from the <HI>Saxons,</HI> who called the West
end of the Citied by that name, where
<HI>Westminster</HI> now standeth, because of the
wildernesse and bushinesse of the soile:
so doe I not read of any street in <HI>London</HI>

called <HI>Cornehill,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">No street in <HI>London</HI> called <HI>Corn∣hill,</HI> before the <HI>Nor∣mans</HI> Conquest.</NOTE> before the Conquest

accompt, though some Copies have
499. for the one, but not without mani∣fest
corruption and error.</P>
<P>And now to returne where we left:
True it is, that a Library there was per∣taining
to this Parish Church, of old
time builded of stone, and of late re∣paired
with Bricke, by the Executors
of Sir <HI>Iohn Crosby,</HI> Alderman, as his
Armes on the South end doe wit∣nesse.</P>
<P>This Library hath bin (of late time)

and commended them; but now
those Bookes are gone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Io. Leyland.</NOTE> and the place is
occupied by a Schoolemaster, and his

their Grammar rules, &amp;c. Not∣withstanding,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Antiqui∣ties of the Fishmon∣gers, 1290</NOTE> and <HI>Salt-fishmongers,</HI> of

were for forestalling, &amp;c. contrary to
the Lawes and constitutions of the Ci∣tie,
fined to the King at 500. Markes,

shew thorow the Citie, with divers Pa∣geants,
and more than 1000. horsemen,
&amp;c. as in the Chapter of Sports and
Pastimes. These two Companies of
Stocke-fishmongers and Salt-fishmon∣gers,
of old time had their severall
Halls, to wit, in <HI>Thames street</HI> twaine,

the Company was so great, as I have

<P>These Fishmongers have beene jol∣ly

1374. It followed, that in the yeere
1382. through the counsel of <HI>Ioh. North∣hampton,</HI>
Draper, then being Maior,
<HI>William Issex, Iohn More,</HI> Mercer, and
<HI>Richard Northbury,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fishmon∣gers for their gree∣tings en∣vied of the other com∣panies.</NOTE> the said Fishmon∣gers
were greatly troubled, hindred of
their liberties, and almost destroyed, by
congregations made against them: So
that in a Parliament at <HI>London,</HI> the con∣troversie
depending betweene the Mai∣or
and Aldermen of <HI>London,</HI> and the
Fishmongers there,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nicholas Exton</HI> for the Fish∣mongers craved the Kings pro∣tection.</NOTE> <HI>Nic. Exton,</HI> Speaker
for the Fishmongers, prayeth the King
to receive him and his Company into
his protection, for feare of corporall
hurt. Whereupon it was commanded,
either part to keepe the peace, upon
paine of losing all they had. Hereupon
a Fishmonger starting up, replyed, that
the complaint brought against them by
the moovers, &amp;c. was but matter of
malice; for that the Fishmongers, in
the reigne of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, being
chiefe Officers of the City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fishmon∣gers by Parliamēt restored to their liberties.</NOTE> had for their
misdemeanors then done, committed
the chiefe exhibitors of those petitions
to prison. In this Parliament, the Fish∣mongers
(by the Kings Charter patents)
were restored to their Liberties. Not∣withstanding,
in the yeere next follow∣ing,
to wit, 1383. <HI>Iohn Cavendish,</HI> Fish∣monger,
craveth the peace against the
Chancellour of <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iohn Caven∣dish</HI> craved the peace againg the Chancel∣lor, chal∣lenged him of ta∣king a bribe.</NOTE> which was
granted, and hee put in sureties, the
Earles of <HI>Stafford</HI> and <HI>Salisbury. Caven∣dish</HI>
challengeth the Chancellour for ta∣king
a bribe of 10. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> for favour of his
Case: which the Chancellour by oath
upon the Sacrament avoideth. In fur∣ther
triall, it was found, that the Chan∣cellours
man (without his Masters pri∣vitie)
had taken it. Whereupon <HI>Caven∣dish</HI>
was adjudged to prison, and to pay
the Chancellour 1000. Markes for slan∣dering
him.</P>
<P>After this, many of the Nobles assem∣bled
at <HI>Reding,</HI> to suppresse the seditious
stirres of the said <HI>Iohn Northampton,</HI> or
<HI>Combarton,</HI> late Maior, that had attem∣pted
great and heinous enterprizes, of
the which he was convict; and when he
stood mute, nor would utter one word,
it was decreed, that he should be com∣mitted
to perpetuall prison, his goods
confiscate to the Kings use, and that he
should not come within 100. miles of
<HI>London</HI> during his life. He was therfore
sent to the Castle of <HI>Tintegall,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Principal adversa∣ries to the Fishemon∣gers con∣demnted to perpe∣tuall pri∣son.</NOTE> in the

as is aforesaid; but they obtained and
had the Kings pardon, in the 14. of his

thus were all these troubles quieted.</P>

<HI>Crooked lane</HI> aforesaid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crooked lane.</NOTE> by St. <HI>Michaels</HI>
Church, towards <HI>New-Fishstreet.</HI> One
the most ancient house in this lane,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leaden Porch <HI>in</HI> Crooked lane.</NOTE> is

of strangers, and selling of Rhe∣nish

S. <HI>Michaels,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parish Church of S. <HI>Michael</HI> in <HI>Crooked lane.</HI></NOTE> was sometime but a small
and homely thing, standing upon part
of that ground, wherein now standeth
the Parsonage house: and the ground
thereabout was a filthy plot, by reason
of the Butchers in <HI>East-cheap,</HI> who made
the same their Laystall.</P>
<P><HI>W. de Burgo</HI> gave two Messuages to
that Church in <HI>Candlewick street, 1317.
Iohn Loveken</HI> Stock-fishmonger, foure
times Maior, builded (in the same
ground) this faire Church of S. <HI>Micha∣el,</HI>
and was there buried in the Quire,
under a faire Tombe, with the Images
of him and his wife in Alabaster: the
said Church hath been since increased
with a new Quire, and side Chappels
by Sir <HI>W. Walworth,</HI> Stock-fishmonger,
Maior, sometime servant to the said
<HI>Iohn Loveken.</HI> Also the Tombe of <HI>Love∣ken</HI>
was removed, and a flat stone of
gray Marble, garnished with plates of
Copper laid on him, as it yet remaineth
in the body of the Church.</P>
<P>This <HI>William Walworth</HI> is reported to
have slaine <HI>Iacke Strawe:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fable of <HI>VV Wal∣worth</HI> and <HI>Iack Straw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> reproved.</NOTE> but <HI>Iack Straw</HI>
being afterward taken, was first adjud∣ged
by the said Maior, and then execu∣ted
by the losse of his head in <HI>Smithfield.</HI>
True it is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Praise of <HI>VV. VVal∣worth</HI> for his man∣hood in arresting of <HI>VVat Tylar.</HI></NOTE> that this <HI>William Walworth,</HI>
being a man wise, learned, and of an in∣comparable
manhood arrested <HI>VVat Ty∣lar,</HI>
a presumptuous Rebell, upon whom
no man durst lay hand, whereby he de∣livered
the King and Kingdome from
most wicked tyranny of Traytors. The
Maior arrested him on the head with a
sound blow: whereupon <HI>Wat Tylar</HI> fu∣riously
strooke the Maior with his Dag∣ger,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Maior was well armed, and had on his head a Basenet.</NOTE> but hurt him not, by reason he was
well armed. The Maior having recei∣ved
his stroke, drew his Basiliard, and
grievously wounded <HI>VVat</HI> in the necke,
and withall, gave him a great blow on
the head:<NOTE PLACE="marg">T. Wal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>g, H. Knight<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Li. S. Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Aborum.</NOTE> in the which conflict, an Es∣quire
of the Kings house, called <HI>Iohn
Cavendish,</HI> drew his sword, and woun∣ded
<HI>VVat</HI> twice or thrice, even to the
death: and <HI>VVat</HI> spurring his horse,
cryed to the Commons to revenge him:
the horse bare him about 80. foot from
the place, and there he fell downe halfe
dead: and by and by, they which at∣tended
on the King, environed him a∣bout,
so as he was not seen of his Com∣pany:
many of them thrust him in, in
divers places of his body, and drew him
into the Hospitall of Saint <HI>Barthole∣mew,</HI>
from whence againe the Maior
caused him to be drawn into <HI>Smithfield,</HI>
and there to bee beheaded. In reward
<PB N="237" REF="129"/>
of this service (the people being disper∣sed)
the King commanded the Maior to
put a Basenet on his head:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maior made Knight, and other∣wise re∣warded.</NOTE> and the Ma∣ior
requesting why he should so do, the
King answered, hee being much bound
unto him, would make him Knight.
The Maior answered, that hee was nei∣ther
worthy, nor able to take such an e∣state
upon him; for hee was but a Mer∣chant,
and had to live by his Merchan∣dise
onely. Notwithstanding, the King
made him to put on his Basenet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Order of making a Knight for service in the field.</NOTE> and
then with a sword in both his hands, he
strongly strooke him on the necke, as
the manner was then. And the same
day he made 3. other Citizens Knights
(for his sake) in the same place, to wit,
<HI>Iohn Philpot,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aldermen Knighted.</NOTE> <HI>Nicholas Brember,</HI> and <HI>Ro∣bert
Launde,</HI> Aldermen. The King gave
to the Maior 100. pound land by yeere,
and to each of the other 40. pound land
yeerely, to them and their heires for
ever.</P>
<P>After this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Michaels Crooked lane.</NOTE> in the same yeere, the said
Sir <HI>William Walworth</HI> founded in the
said Parish Church of Saint <HI>Michael,</HI> a
Colledge, of a Master and nine Priests
or Chaplens, and deceasing 1385. was
there buried in the North Chappell by
the Quire:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monumēt of Sir <HI>VV. VValworth</HI> defaced and since falsified, and so re∣maineth.</NOTE> but his Monument being
(amongst other by bad people) defaced
in the reigne of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, and a∣gaine
since renued by the Fishmongers,
for lacke of knowledge, whatsoever be∣fore
had beene written in this Epitaph,
they followed a fabulous Booke, and
wrote <HI>Iacke Strawe,</HI> in stead of <HI>Wat Ty∣lar:</HI>
a great error, meet to be reformed
there, and elsewhere; and therefore have
I the more at large discoursed of this
matter.</P>
<P>It hath also been, and is now growne
to a common opinion, that in reward of
this service done by the said <HI>VVilliam
VValworth</HI> against the Rebell; that King
<HI>Richard</HI> added to the Armes of this Ci∣ty
(which was Argent, a plaine Crosse
Gules) a Sword,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dunthorne.</NOTE> or Dagger, (for so
they terme it) whereof I have read no
such Record, but to the contrary. I
finde, that in the fourth yeere of <HI>Richard</HI>
the second, in a full assembly made in
the upper Chamber of the <HI>Guildhall,</HI>
summoned by this <HI>William Walworth,</HI>
then Maior, as well of Aldermen, as of
the Common Councell in every Ward,
for certain affaires concerning the King;
it was there by common consent agreed
and ordained, that the old Seale of the
Office of the Maioraltie of the City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Old Seale of the Ma∣ioralty broken, and a new Seale made.</NOTE> be∣ing
very small, old, unapt, and uncome∣ly
for the honour of the City, should be
broken, and one other new should bee
had, Which the said Maior comman∣ded
to be made artificially, and honou∣rable
for the exercise of the said Office
therafter in place of the other. In which
new Seale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arms of this Ci∣ty were not alte∣red, but remaine afore: to wit, Ar∣gent, a plaine Crosse Gules, a Sword of S. <HI>Paul</HI> in the first quarter, and no Dagger of <HI>VV. VVal∣worth,</HI> as is fabuled.</NOTE> besides the Images of <HI>Peter</HI>
and <HI>Paul,</HI> which of old were rudely en∣graven,
there should bee under the feet
of the said Images, a Shield of the
Armes of the said City perfectly graven
with two Lions supporting the same,
and two Sergeants of Armes, in the o∣ther
part, one, and two Tabernacles, in
which, above, should stand two Angels
between whom (above the said Images
of <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul)</HI> should be set the glo∣rious
Virgin. This being done, the old
Seale of the Office was delivered to <HI>Ri∣chard
Odiham</HI> Chamberlain, who brake
it, and in place thereof, was delivered
the new Seale to the said Maior, to use
in his Office of Maioralty, as occasion
should require. This new Seale seemeth
to be made before <HI>VVilliam VValworth</HI>
was Knighted, for he is not there intitu∣led
Sir, as afterwards he was: and cer∣taine
it is, that the same new Seale then
made, is now in use, and none other in
that Office of the Maioralty. Which
may suffice to answer the former Fable,
without shewing of any evidence sealed
with the old Seale which was the
Crosse, and Sword of Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> and
not the Dagger of <HI>VVilliam VValworth.</HI></P>

His Monument can be proved to bee in
that Church, as his Armes in the glasse
windowes and Grave-stones doe suffi∣ciently
shew. Besides, those houses
were his gift to the Drapers, and they
pay a quit-rent in his name yeerely for
ever. All which are sufficient to testifie
that he was not buried in the Priorie of
the holy <HI>Trinity</HI> within <HI>Ealdgate,</HI> (now

satisfied in the Drapers Hall.</P>

<HI>Henry</HI> the third, at the request of his

first renued and confirmed that Charter
of Liberties, granted by his Father. And
in the tenth yeere of the same <HI>Edward,
Henry Wallis</HI> being Maior, a great con∣troversie
did arise between the said Ma∣ior,
and the Merchants of the <HI>Haunce</HI> of
<HI>Almaine,</HI> about the reparations of <HI>Bi∣shopsgate,</HI>
then likely to fall, for that the
said Merchants enjoyed divers priviled∣ges,
in respect of maintaining the said
Gate, which they now denyed to re∣paire:
for the appeasing of which con∣troversie,
<PB N="250" REF="136"/>
the King sent his Writ to the
Treasurer, and Barons of his Exchequer
commanding, that they should make
inquisition thereof: Before whom the
Merchants being called, when they were
not able to discharge themselves, sith
they enjoyed the liberties to them gran∣ted
for the same; a Precept was sent
to the Maior and Sheriffes, to distraine
the said Merchants to make reparations,
namely, <HI>Gerard Marbod,</HI> Alderman of
the <HI>Haunce; Ralph de Cussarde,</HI> a Citi∣zen
of <HI>Colen, Ludero de Denevar,</HI> a Bur∣gesse
of <HI>Trivar; Iohn</HI> of <HI>Aras,</HI> a Bur∣gesse
of <HI>Trivon; Bartram</HI> of <HI>Hamburgh;

then remaining in the said City of
<HI>London,</HI> for themselves, and all other
Merchants of the <HI>Haunce:</HI> and so they
granted 210. Markes sterling to the
Maior and Citizens, and undertooke,
that they and their successors should
(from time to time) repaire the said
Gate, and beare the third part of the
charges in mony, and men to defend it,
when need were.</P>
<P>And for this agreement, the said Ma∣ior
and Citizens granted to the said
Merchants their liberties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Merchants of the <HI>Haunce,</HI> of <HI>Almaine,</HI> li∣cenced to lay up their corn in Gar∣ners, but to sell it within 40. dayes af∣ter.</NOTE> which till of
late they have enjoyed, as namely, a∣mongst
other, that they might lay up
their Graine, which they brought into
this Realme, in Innes, and sell it in their
Garners, by the space of forty dayes af∣ter
they had laid it up; except by the
Maior and Citizens they were expresse∣ly
forbidden, because of dearth, or o∣ther
reasonable occasions. Also, they
might have their Aldermen, as they
had been accustomed, foreseen alwaies,
that he were of the City, and presented
to the Maior and Aldermen of the Ci∣ty,
so oft as any should be chosen, and
should take an oath before them, to
maintaine Iustice in their Courts, and
to behave themselves in their Office ac∣cording
to Law, and as it stood with the
Customes of the City.</P>
<P>Thus much for their Priviledges:
Whereby it appeareth, that they were
great Merchants of Corne, brought out
of the East parts hither, insomuch, that
the occupiers of husbandry in this Land
were enforced to complaine of them,
for bringing in such aboundance, when
the Corne of this Realme was at an ea∣sie
price.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act of Parliamēt forbidding Corne to be brought from be∣yond Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> Whereupon it was ordained

not the price of 6. <HI>s. 8. <ABBR>d.</ABBR></HI> Rie 4. <HI>s.</HI> the
Quarter, and Barley 3. shillings the
Quarter, upon forfeiture the one halfe
to the King, the other halfe to the seisor
thereof. These Merchants of the <HI>Haunce</HI>
had their <HI>Guild hall</HI> in <HI>Thames street,</HI> in
place aforesaid, by the said <HI>Cosin lane.</HI>
Their Hall is large, builded of Stone,
with three arched Gates towards the
street, the middlemost whereof is farre
bigger than the other, and is seldome o∣pened,
the other two be mured up: the
same is now called the <HI>Old Hall.</HI></P>
<P>Of later time, to wit, in the sixth of
<HI>Richard</HI> the second, they hired one house
next adjoyning to their old Hall, which
sometime belonged to <HI>Richard Lions,</HI> a
famous Lapidarie, one of the Sheriffes
of <HI>Lond.</HI> in the 49. of <HI>Edward</HI> the third,
and in the fourth of <HI>Richard</HI> the second,

house, and beheaded in West <HI>Cheape.</HI>
This also was a great house, with a large

and <HI>Abraham</HI> his sonne since possessed
it.</P>
<P>Then was there one other Lane,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VVoolseys Lane.</NOTE>
sometime called <HI>Woolseys gate,</HI> now out

the banke of <HI>Thames,</HI> is builded by

end is builded on and stopped up
by the Chamberlaine of <HI>London. Iohn
Butler,</HI> Draper, one of the Sheriffes,
in the yeere 1420. dwelled there: Hee
appointed his house to be sold, and the

it was of <HI>Alhallowes Parish the lesse.</HI></P>

<P>Touching this <HI>Cold Harbrough,</HI> I find,
that in the 13. of <HI>Edward</HI> the second,
Sir <HI>Iohn Abel,</HI> Knight, demised or let
unto <HI>Henry Stow,</HI> Draper, all that his
capitall Messuage, called the <HI>Cold Har∣brough,</HI>
in the Parish of <HI>All Saints ad foe∣num,</HI>
and all the purtenances within the
Gate, with the Key which <HI>Robert Hart∣ford,</HI>
Citizen, sonne to <HI>William Hartford,</HI>
had, and ought, and the foresaid <HI>Robert</HI>
paid for it the rent of 33. shillings the
yeere. This <HI>Robert Hartford</HI> being own∣er
thereof, as also of other lands in <HI>Sur∣rey;</HI>
deceasing without issue male, left
two daughters his Coheires, to wit, <HI>I∣donia,</HI>
married to Sir <HI>Ralph Bigot,</HI> and
<HI>Maude,</HI> married to Sir <HI>Stephen Cosenton,</HI>
Knights, betweene whom the said house
and lands were parted. After the which
<HI>Iohn Bigot,</HI> Sonne to the said Sir <HI>Ralph</HI>
and Sir <HI>Iohn Cosenton,</HI> did sell their moi∣ties
of <HI>Cold Harbrough</HI> unto <HI>Iohn Poult∣ney,</HI>
sonne of <HI>Adam Poultney,</HI> the eighth
of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. This Sir <HI>Iohn Poult∣ney</HI>
dwelling in this house, and being 4.
times Maior, the said house tooke the
name of <HI>Poultney's Inne.</HI> Notwithstan∣ding,
this Sir <HI>Iohn Poultney,</HI> the 21. of
<HI>Edward</HI> the third, by his Charter gave
and confirmed to <HI>Humfrey de Bohune,</HI>
Earle of <HI>Hereford</HI> and <HI>Essex,</HI> his whole
tenement, called <HI>Cold Harbrough,</HI> with
all the Tenements and Key adjoyning,
and appurtenances sometime pertaining
to <HI>Robert de Herford,</HI> on the way called
<HI>Hay-wharfe lane,</HI> &amp;c. for one Rose at
Midsummer, to him and his heires, for
all services, if the same were demanded.
This Sir <HI>Iohn Poultney</HI> deceased 1349.
and left issue, by <HI>Margaret</HI> his wife, <HI>Wil∣liam
Poultney,</HI> who dyed without issue:
and <HI>Margaret</HI> his Mother was married

S. Cleare</HI> gave two Messuages, per∣taining

<P>In the yeere 1397. the 21 of <HI>Richard</HI>
the second, <HI>Iohn Holland,</HI> Earle of <HI>Hun∣tington,</HI>
was lodged there, and <HI>Richard</HI>
the second his Brother dined with him:
it was then counted a right faire and
stately house. But in the next yeere
following, I finde, that <HI>Edmond,</HI> Earle
of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> was there lodged: not∣withstanding,
the said house still retai∣ned
the name of <HI>Poultney's Inne,</HI> in the
reigne of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, the 26. of his
reigne. It belonged since to <HI>H. Holland</HI>
Duke of <HI>Excester,</HI> and hee was lodged
there in the yeere 1472. In the yeere
1485. <HI>Richard</HI> the third, by his Letters
Patents granted and gave to <HI>Iohn Writh,
alias Garter,</HI> principall King of Armes
of <HI>English</HI> men, and to the rest of the
Kings Heralds and Pursevants of Arms,
all that Messuage with the appurtenan∣ces,
called <HI>Cold Harber,</HI> in the Parish of
<HI>All Saints</HI> the little in <HI>London,</HI> and their
successors for ever. Dated at <HI>Westmin∣ster</HI>
the second of March, <HI>Anno regni suiprimo,</HI>
without fine or see. How the said
Heralds departed, therewith, I have
not read, but in the reigne of <HI>Henry</HI> the
eighth, the Bishop of <HI>Durhams</HI> house,
neere <HI>Charing Crosse,</HI> being taken into
the Kings hand, <HI>Cuthbert Tunstal,</HI> Bi∣shop

<HI>Cold Harber,</HI> since the which time it
hath belonged to the Earles of <HI>Shrews∣bury,</HI>
by composition (as is supposed)
from the said <HI>Cuthbert Tunstall.</HI> The

<P>The Vintners in <HI>London</HI> were (of old
time) called Merchants Vintners of
<HI>Gascoyne,</HI> and so I reade them in the
records of <HI>Edward</HI> the 2. the 11. yeere,
and <HI>Edward</HI> the 3. the ninth yeere, they
were as well Englishmen, as strangers
borne beyond the Seas, but then subjects
to the King of <HI>England,</HI> great <HI>Burdeaux</HI>
Merchants of <HI>Gascoyne</HI> and <HI>French</HI> wines;
divers of them were Maiors of this Ci∣tie;
namely, <HI>Ioh. Adrian,</HI> Vintner, <HI>Reig∣nold</HI>
at Conduit, <HI>Iohn Oxenford, Henry
Picard,</HI> that feasted the Kings of <HI>Eng∣land,
France, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Cypres: Iohn
Stodie,</HI> that gave <HI>Stodies lane</HI> to the Vint∣ners:
which foure last named, were
Maiors in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third,
and yet <HI>Gascoyne</HI> Wines were then to
be sold at <HI>London,</HI> not above 4. pence,
nor <HI>Rhenish</HI> Wines above 6. pence the
Gallon.</P>
<P>I reade of sweet Wines, that in the
50. of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Iohn Peachie,</HI>
Fishmonger, was accused, for that hee
procured a Licence for the onely sale of
them in <HI>London:</HI> which notwithstan∣ding
he justified by Law, he was impri∣soned
and fined.</P>
<P>More I read, that in the 6. of <HI>Hen. 6.</HI>
the <HI>Lombards</HI> corrupting their sweet
Wines, when knowledge thereof came
to <HI>Iohn Rainwell,</HI> Maior of <HI>London,</HI> hee
(in divers places of the Citie) comman∣ded
the heads of the Buts and other ves∣sels,
in the open streets, to be broken, to
the number of one hundred and fifty, so
that the liquor running forth, passed
thorow the Citie like a streame of raine
water, in the sight of all the people;
from whence there issued a most loath∣some
savour.</P>
<P>I read in the reigne of <HI>Henry</HI> the 7.
that no sweet VVines were brought in∣to
this Realme, but Malmsies, by the
<HI>Longobards,</HI> paying to the King for his
Licence, 6. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 8. <ABBR>d.</ABBR></HI> of every But, besides
12. <HI><ABBR>d.</ABBR></HI> for Bottell-large. I remember,
within these 54. yeeres, Malmsey not
to be sold above 1. <HI>d. ob.</HI> the pint. For

<P>At the upper end of this Street,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tower-Roy∣all</HI> builded about <HI>Hen∣ry</HI> the 1. as may bee supposed.</NOTE> is
the <HI>Tower Royall,</HI> whereof that street ta∣keth
name. This Tower and great place
was so called, of pertaining to the Kings
of this Realme:<NOTE PLACE="marg">King <HI>Ste∣phen</HI> was lodged there.</NOTE> but by whom the same
was first builded, or of what Antiquity
continued, I have not read more, than
that in the reigne of King <HI>Edward 1.</HI> se∣cond,
fourth, and seventh yeeres, it was
the tenement of <HI>Simon Beawmes.</HI> Also,
that in the 36. of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, the
same was called the <HI>Royall,</HI> in the Parish
of S. <HI>Michael de Pater noster,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Frisard.</NOTE> and that
in the three and fortieth of his Reigne,
he gave it by the name of his <HI>Inne,</HI> cal∣led
the <HI>Royall,</HI> in his Citie of <HI>London,</HI> in
value twenty pounds by yeere, unto his
Colledge of S. <HI>Stephen</HI> at <HI>Westminster.</HI>
Notwithstanding, in the reigne of <HI>Ri∣chard</HI>
the second, it was called The
<HI>Queene Wardrobe,</HI> as appeareth by this
that followeth:</P>
<P>King <HI>Richard,</HI> having in <HI>Smithfield</HI> o∣vercome
and dispersed the Rebels, hee,
<PB N="258" REF="140"/>
his Lords and all his Company,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lady Princesse lodged in the Tower Royall.</NOTE> entered the
City of <HI>London,</HI> with great joy, and went
to the Lady Princesse his Mother, who was
then lodged in the <HI>Tower-Royall,</HI> called
the <HI>Queenes Wardrope,</HI> where shee had
remained three dayes and two nights, right
sore abashed. But when shee saw the King
her Sonne, she was greatly rejoyced and said,
Ah Sonne, what great sorrow have I suffe∣red
for you this day! The King answered
and said; Certainely, Madame, I know it
well, but now rejoyce, and thanke God, for
I have this day recovered mine heritage,
and the Realme of <HI>England,</HI> which I had
neere-hand lost.</P>
<P>This Tower seemeth to have beene
(at that time) of good defence, for when
the Rebels had beset the Tower of <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
and got possession thereof, taking
from thence whom they listed, as in my
Annales I have shewed; the Princesse
being force to flye, came to this Tow∣er
Royall▪ where shee was lodged, and
remained safe as yee have heard, and it
may bee also supposed, that the King
himselfe was at that time lodged there.
I reade, that in the yeere 1386. <HI>Ly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI>
King of <HI>Armony,</HI> being chased out of
his Realme by the <HI>Tartarians,</HI> received
innumerable gifts of the King and of his
Nobles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King <HI>Ri∣chard</HI> lod∣ged in the Tower-Royall.</NOTE> the King then lying in the <HI>Roy∣all,</HI>
where hee also granted to the said
King of <HI>Armony,</HI> a Charter of a thou∣sand
pounds by yeere during his life.
This for proofe may suffice, that Kings
of <HI>England</HI> have beene lodged in this
Tower, though the same (of later time)
hath been neglected, and turned into
stabling for the Kings, horses, and now
letten out to divers men, and divided
into Tenements.</P>
<P>In <HI>Horse-bridge street</HI> is the Cutlers

lodged, as in the heart of the City, for
his more safety.</P>
<P><HI>Robert</HI> Earle of <HI>Glocester,</HI> Brother to
the Empresse, being taken, was com∣mitted
to the custody of this <HI>William,</HI> to
be kept in the Castle of <HI>Rochester,</HI> till
King <HI>Stephen</HI> was also taken, and then
the one was delivered in exchange for
the other, and both set free: This <HI>Wil∣liam</HI>
of <HI>Ipres</HI> gave <HI>Edredes Hith,</HI> now
called <HI>Queenes Hith,</HI> to the Prior and
Canons of the holy Trinity in <HI>London:</HI>
he founded the Abbey of <HI>Borley</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI>
&amp;c. In the first of <HI>Henry</HI> the second, the
said <HI>William,</HI> with all the other <HI>Flem∣mings</HI>
(fearing the indignation of the
new King) departed the Land, but it
seemeth that the said <HI>William</HI> was short∣ly
called back againe, and restored both
to the Kings favour, and to his old pos∣sessions
here, so that the name and fami∣ly
continued long after in this Realme,

<P>In the yeere 1377. the 51. of <HI>Edward</HI>

Duke of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> and <HI>Henry Percy</HI>
Marshall, (for causes shewed in my Annals)
sought up and downe, and could not finde
them, for they were that day to dine with
<HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Ipres</HI> at his Inne, which the <HI>Lon∣doners</HI>
wist not of, but thought the Duke
and Marshall had beene at the <HI>Savoy,</HI> and
therefore poasted thither. But one of the
Dukes Knights seeing these things, came in
great haste to the place where the Duke was,
and after that hee had knocked, and could
not be let in, he said to <HI>Haveland</HI> the Por∣ter,
If thou love my Lord and thy life, open
the Gate: with which words hee gat entry,
and with great feare he tels the Duke, that
without the gate were infinite numbers of
armed men, and unlesse he tooke great heed,
that day would bee his last. With which
words the Duke leapt so hastily from his Oy∣sters,
that he hurt both his legs against the
forme: VVine was offered, but hee could
not drinke for haste, and so fled with his fel∣low
<HI>Henry Percy</HI> out at a backe gate, and
entring upon the <HI>Thames,</HI> never stayed
rowing, untill they came to a house neere
the Manor of <HI>Kennington,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kennington <HI>besides</HI> Lambeth.</NOTE> where at that

<P>At the upper end of <HI>Hosier lane,</HI> to∣ward
<HI>West-Cheape,</HI> is the faire Parish
Church of S. <HI>Mary Bow.</HI> This Church
in the reigne of <HI>William</HI> the Conque∣rour,
being the first in this Citie buil∣ded
on Arches of stone,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>New</HI> Mary <HI>Church, or</HI> S. Mary Bow <HI>in</HI> West Chea∣ping. L. Colchester</NOTE> was therefore
called new <HI>Mary</HI> Church, of Saint <HI>Ma∣ry
de Arcubus,</HI> or <HI>le Bow,</HI> in <HI>West Chea∣ping:</HI>
As <HI>Stratford</HI> Bridge, being the
first builded (by <HI>Matilda,</HI> the Queene,
wife to <HI>Henry</HI> the first) with Arches of
stone, was called <HI>Stratford le Bow,</HI> which
names to the said Church and Bridge,
remaine till this day. The Court of the
Arches is kept in this Church, and ta∣keth
name of the place, not the place of
the Court; but of what antiquity or
continuation that Court hath there
continued, I cannot learne.</P>
<P>This Church is of <HI>Cordwainer street</HI>
Ward, and for divers accidents hapning
there, hath bin made more famous than
any other Parish Church of the whole
Citie, or Suburbs. First we read, that
in the yeere 1090. and the third of <HI>Wil∣liam
Rufus,</HI> by tempest of wind, the
roofe of the Church of Saint <HI>Mary Bow</HI>
in <HI>Cheape</HI> was overturned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Roofe of <HI>Bow</HI> Church o∣verturned by tem∣pest.</NOTE> wherewith
some persons were slaine, and foure of
the rafters of sixe and twenty foot in
length, with such violence were pitched
in the ground of the high street, that
scantly foure foot of them remained a∣bove
ground, which were faine to bee
cut even with the ground, because they
could not be plucked out; for the Citie
of <HI>London</HI> was not then paved, but a
moorish ground.</P>
<P>In the yeere 1196. <HI>William Fitz Os∣bert,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bow</HI> stee∣ple forti∣fied.</NOTE> a seditious Traitor, tooke the stee∣ple
of <HI>Bow,</HI> and fortified it with muni∣tions
and victuals; but it was assaulted,
and <HI>William</HI> with his complices, were
taken (though without blood-shed) for
he was forced by fire and smoke to for∣sake
the Church, and then being by the
Iudges condemned, he was by the heels
drawne to the <HI>Elmes</HI> in <HI>Smithfield,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A false ac∣cuser of his elder brother, in the end was han∣ged.</NOTE> and
there hanged with nine of his fellowes,
where because his favoures came not
to deliver him, he forsooke <HI>Maries</HI> Son,
(as he termed <HI>Christ</HI> our Saviour) &amp; cal∣led
upon the Divell to help and deliver
him. Such was the end of this deceiver,
a man of an evill life, a secret murtherer,
a filthy fornicator, a polluter of concu∣bines,
and (amongst other his detestable
facts) a false accuser of his elder brother,
who had (in his youth) brought him up
in learning, and done many things for
his preferment.</P>
<P>In the yeere 1271. a great part of the
Steeple of <HI>Bow</HI> fell downe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bow</HI> stee∣ple fell downe.</NOTE> and slew ma∣ny
people, men and women. In the yeere
1284. the thirteenth of <HI>Edward</HI> the first,
<HI>Laurence Ducket,</HI> Goldsmith, having
grievously wounded one <HI>Ralph Crepin</HI>
in <HI>West Cheape,</HI> fled into <HI>Bow</HI> Church,
into the which (in the night time)
<PB N="269" REF="145"/>
entred certaine evill persons, friends
unto the sayd <HI>Ralph,</HI> and slew the sayd
<HI>Laurence</HI> lying in the Steeple, and then
hanged him up, placing him so by the
window, as if hee had hanged himselfe,
and so was it found by inquisition. For
the which fact, <HI>Lawrence Ducket</HI> being
drawne by the feete, was buried in a
ditch without the City. But shortly af∣ter
(by relation of a Boy, who lay with
the sayd <HI>Lawrence</HI> at the time of his
death, and had hid him there for feare)
the truth of the matter was disclosed.
For the which cause, <HI>Iordan Good-cheape,
Ralph Crepin, Gilbert Clarke,</HI> and <HI>Geffrey
Clarke</HI> were attainted, and a certaine
woman named <HI>Alice,</HI> that was chiefe
causer of the sayd mischiefe, was bur∣ned,
and to the number of sixteene men
were drawne and hanged; besides o∣thers,
that being richer, after long im∣prisonment,
were hanged by the purse.</P>
<P>The Church was interdicted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bow Church interdi∣cted.</NOTE> the
doores and windowes were stopped
up with Thornes: but <HI>Lawrence</HI> was ta∣ken
up, and honestly buried in the
Church-yard.</P>
<P>The Parish Church of Saint <HI>Mary
Bow,</HI> by meanes of incroachment, and
building of houses, wanting roome in
their Church-yard for buriall of the
dead, <HI>Iohn Rotham,</HI> or <HI>Rodham,</HI> Citizen
and Taylor, by his Testament dated
the yeare 1465. gave to the Parson and
Church-wardens a certaine Garden in
<HI>Hosier lane,</HI> to be a Church-yard: which
so continued neere a hundred yeares,
but now is builded on, and is a private
mans house. The old Steeple of this
Church was by little and little re-edifi∣ed,
and new builded up, at the least so
much as was fallen downe; many men
giving summes of money to the furthe∣rance
thereof: So that at length, to wit,
in the yeare 1469. it was ordained by
a Common Councell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bow Bell to bee rung nightly at nine of the clock.</NOTE> that the <HI>Bow
Bell</HI> should bee nightly rung at nine of
the clocke.</P>
<P>Shortly after, <HI>Iohn Donne,</HI> Mercer,
by his Testament dated 1472. accor∣ding
to the trust of <HI>Reginald Longdon,</HI>
gave to the Parson &amp; Church-wardens
of Saint <HI>Mary Bow,</HI> two Tenements,
with the appurtenances, since made in∣to
one, in <HI>Hosier lane,</HI> then so called, to
the maintenance of <HI>Bow Bell,</HI> the same
to bee rung as aforesayd, and other
things to bee observed, as by the VVill
appeareth.</P>
<P>This Bel being usually rung somewhat
late, as seemed to the young men Pren∣tises,
and other in <HI>Cheape,</HI> they made
and set up a time against the Clerke, as
followeth:</P>
<Q><L>Clarke of the <HI>Bow-Bell</HI></L>
<L>with the yellow lockes,</L>
<L>For thy late ringing,</L>
<L>thy head shall have knockes.</L></Q>
<P>Wherunto the Clerke replying, wrote:</P>
<Q><L>Children of Cheape,</L>
<L>hold you all still,</L>
<L>For you shall have the</L>
<L>Bow-bell rung at your will.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Robert Harding,</HI> Goldsmith, one of
the Sheriffes 1478. gave to the new
worke of that Steeple forty pound. <HI>Iohn
Haw,</HI> Mercer, ten pound, Doctor <HI>Allen,</HI>
foure pound, <HI>Thomas Baldry</HI> foure
pound, and other gave other summes,
so that the sayd worke of the Steeple
was finished in the yeere 1512. The
Arches or Bowes thereupon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bow or Arches on Bow stee∣ple.</NOTE> with the
Lanthornes five in number, to wit, one
at each corner, and one on the top in
the middle vpon the Arches, were also
afterward finished of stone, brought
from <HI>Cane</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> delivered at
the <HI>Customers Key</HI> for foure shillings
eight pence the Tunne. <HI>William Cop∣land</HI>
Taylor, the Kings Merchant,
and <HI>Andrew Fuller,</HI> Mercer, being
Church-wardens 1515. and 1516. It
is sayd that this <HI>Copland</HI> gave the great
Bell, which made the fifth in the ring,
to be rung nightly at nine of the clocke.
This Bell was first rung (as a knell) at
the buriall of the same <HI>Copland.</HI> It ap∣peareth,
that the Lanthornes on the
top of this Steeple, were meant to have
been glased, and lights in them placed
nightly in the winter, whereby travel∣lers
to the City might have the better
sight thereof, and not to misse of their
wayes.</P>
<P>In this Parish also was a Grammar
Schoole,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grammar schoole in Bow Church∣yard.</NOTE> by commandement of King
<HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, which Schoole was (of
old time) kept in an house for that pur∣pose
prepared in the Church-yard; but
that Schoole being decayed, as others
about this City, the Schoole-house was
let out for rent, in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the

eighth, for foure shillings the yeare, a

two Vaults under the Church for fif∣teene
shillings both.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vaults un∣der Bow Church.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Monuments in this Church bee

called <HI>West Cheaping:</HI>
which VVard, as a ri∣ver
that hath 3. heads,
and running along to the uttermost of
his bounds, issueth out on the sides into
little streames: So this Ward, begin∣ning
on the course of <HI>Walbrooke,</HI> and is
not the meanest of the Wards (if for no
other cause, yet because it is neerest to
the heart of the City) hath his begin∣ning
on the East from three places; <HI>The
high streete of the Poultry, The lower end
of Buckles bury,</HI> and <HI>The neather part of
the Venell or Entry into Scalding Alley;</HI>
and so running along, as farre as unto
the North-east corner of <HI>Bow lane</HI> on
the South side, &amp; from thence into <HI>Bow
lane</HI> on the East side, untill ye come to
the channel over-against the cellar door
under the Church; and then, on the
North side of <HI>Cheape,</HI> up to the <HI>Stan∣dard,</HI>
stretching it selfe into divers Lanes
and Peeces on the right hand, and on
the left hand, as it commeth along.</P>
<P>First, for the high streete of the <HI>Poul∣try</HI>
(which is the maine body of this
Ward:) On the South side thereof, to∣ward
the East, this Ward beginneth at
the corner house, now in the tenure of
one <HI>Robert Knight,</HI> in the way going
downe to Saint <HI>Mary Wool-Church,</HI> an∣ciently
knowne by the signe of the Li∣on:
the out-most part of which house,
and of this Ward there (the house be∣ing
divided) is at the crosse-channell
over-against (or very neere) the great
West doore of <HI>Wool-Church,</HI> and so it
goeth along on the South side of the
<HI>Poultry</HI> to the great Conduit, and so in∣to
<HI>Bow lane,</HI> as is aforesaid.</P>
<P>Secondly, for <HI>Buckles bury,</HI> this Ward
beginneth there toward the lower end:
On the North side, at a Channell neere
to the end of the house, bearing the
signe of the <HI>Christopher,</HI> toward the
East, now in the tenure of one <HI>Iohn
Hodges:</HI> On the South side, it beginneth
at the East end of the great new Frame
of Building, over-against the said <HI>Chri∣stopher;</HI>
which is the Tenement on the
East side, next to the blacke Bull; and
so it goeth into all the <HI>Barge.</HI> And then
VVestward, it goeth on both sides the
way, <HI>viz.</HI> on the North side, to the
great Conduit, and so to <HI>Bow lane,</HI> as is
aforesayd; and on the South side, to
the end of Saint <HI>Sythes lane.</HI> Then
crossing over the Channell, to S. <HI>Bennet
Shorhogs</HI> Church, it stretcheth all along
through <HI>Needlers lane,</HI> by St. <HI>Pancrates</HI>
Church, on the same side, untill yee
come to a great Gate, which is in the
nooke of a little passage or entry to the
VVest, and is the backe gate of a house,
standing in <HI>Bow lane,</HI> sometime the
dwelling house of Master <HI>Paruis.</HI> Then
againe it stretcheth from the Chaine in
the middest of <HI>Sopers lane</HI> (on both sides
the Lane) upward toward the North,
into <HI>Cheape</HI> on the South side, and so in∣to
<HI>Bow lane,</HI> as is aforesayd.</P>
<P>Thirdly, for the last place of this
VVards beginning: On the North side
of the high streete, neere unto the
<HI>Stockes-Market,</HI> is an Alley or Lane,
called <HI>Scalding Alley,</HI> not erroneously
(as some have published) but truely, as
neerest to the most ancient denominati∣on
thereof; which was, <HI>Scalding-house,
alias, Scalding-wike,</HI> and <HI>Scalding lane,</HI>
as appeareth by good records extant
of two hundred yeeres continuance.
VVithin the <HI>Venell</HI> or entry of this Lane
or Alley, neere unto the VVell, that
standeth in a corner to the VVest, this
VVard beginneth at the end of the
stone wall, wherein is the doore leading
<PB N="274" REF="147"/>
unto the Parsonage house and Church
of Saint <HI>Mildred</HI> (of which, more anon)
and it runneth on that side the Chan∣nell
along to the East corner of the said
Church, and from thence on the North
side of the streete, into the <HI>Compter,</HI> and
<HI>Cony-hoope lane,</HI> and within <HI>Cony-hoope
lane,</HI> into all <HI>Skinners Alley,</HI> and the
Grocers Hall and Garden; and then
backe againe into the <HI>Old Iewry</HI> Lane,
on the West side as farre as Alderman
<HI>Welds</HI> house, and on the East side as
farre as the dead stone Wall of the
great house over-against it, sometime
Alderman <HI>Andersons</HI> house. Then to re∣turne
to the west end of <HI>Old Iewry</HI> a∣gaine,
this VVard stretcheth along on
the North side by the Mercers Hall un∣to
<HI>Iron-mongers lane,</HI> (which all wholly
on both sides is in this VVard) and so
into <HI>Catton streete.</HI> In <HI>Catton streete</HI> this
Ward entreth, toward the East, at a
house anciently knowne by the signe of
the <HI>Talbot,</HI> on the South side, now in
the tenure of Master <HI>Packhurst;</HI> and o∣ver-against
it, on the North side, at a
deepe Channell, issuing out of a house,
and so goeth up to the west on both
sides, <HI>videlicet,</HI> on the South side of the
way, beyond the end of Saint <HI>Lawrence
lane,</HI> untill ye come to that middle part
of the Church wall, which is beyond
the Church Porch; and on the North
side, from that corner of the Church
wall, it goeth on the East side of the
Channell to the Church yard; and
from thence, on both sides the way, un∣to
the outward gate leading unto
Guild-hall yard, and adioyning to the
Taverne of the three Tunnes. Then a∣gaine
to come into <HI>Cheape,</HI> there, on
the North side, is Saint <HI>Lawrence lane,</HI>
all which is wholly of this VVard, and
so is <HI>Hony lane</HI> above that; and so it rea∣cheth
westward as farre as a shallow
Channell, close beyond the <HI>Standard.</HI>
And thus stand the bounds of <HI>Cheape
Ward.</HI></P>
<P>Now, for Antiquities, and things
worthy of memory in <HI>Cheape Ward.</HI></P>
<P>First, in the maine body of this
VVard, that is, the <HI>Poultry,</HI> standeth
the proper little Church, that beareth
the name of Saint <HI>Mildred in the Poul∣try,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Mil∣dreds Church.</NOTE> <HI>the Virgin;</HI> which name was given
surely for distinction, not for superstiti∣on:
For so was the custome of the
Kingdome (and yet is) in building these
thing for the service of God, that the
Founders called them by the name of
some Apostle, Saint, Martyr, or Con∣fessor,
as best liked their owne conceit
at the present time, to distinguish them
from others.</P>
<P>VVho this <HI>Mildred</HI> was; whether
she was that eldest daughter of <HI>Merwal∣dus,</HI>
King of VVest-<HI>Mercians,</HI> as some
thinke, or that shee was daughter of <HI>E∣thelbert,</HI>
King of <HI>Kent,</HI> one of the Foun∣ders
of <HI>Pauls</HI> Church; I finde no Re∣cord
to specifie, neither is it much ma∣teriall:
but it is probable, that shee was
some holy and devout Maide, which
the people of that age held to bee a
Saint afterward in heaven.</P>
<P>In what yeeres this Church was first
erected, or who was the first Founder
of it, we finde not: But it appeareth by
some ancient Evidences of the sayd
Church, that from the beginning it had
not so much spare ground about it, as
to make a Church yard of; untill in the
yeere of our Lord God 1420. and the
eighth of King <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, <HI>Thomas
Morsted,</HI> Esquire, and Chirurgeon to
the Kings, <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, <HI>Henry</HI> the
fifth, and <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, (and after∣ward,
<HI>in Anno Dom. 1436.</HI> was Sheriffe
and Alderman of <HI>London)</HI> gave unto the
Church a parcell of ground,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Church yard gi∣ven.</NOTE> lying be∣tweene
his dwelling house and the sayd
Church (and adjoyning unto the sayd
Church toward the North) to make a
Church yard of, for the buriall of their
dead; containing in length, from the
course of <HI>Walbrooke,</HI> toward the west,
forty five foote, and in breadth, from
the Church toward the North, thirty
five foote.</P>
<P>Within short time after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Par∣sonage house and chambers.</NOTE> some body,
of religious and charitable disposition,
erected upon the sides of the sayd
Church yard, but upon Posts and Pil∣lars,
with Cloysters underneath, toward
the west, a Parsonage house, or Mansi∣on
and free dwelling of the Ministers
and Rectors of the sayd Church: and
toward the East foure chambers, then
called the <HI>Priests Chambers;</HI> now con∣verted
into a Tenement or dwelling
house, and demised for yeerly rent. But
the Church yard is much abridged, and
<PB N="274" REF="148"/>
of late foulely defaced, and the lights of
the said Parsonage hindered by additi∣ons
of Peeces to the said ancient cham∣bers,
which ought not to be.</P>
<P>After some yeeres expired,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Church taken downe and new built.</NOTE> the Par∣son
and Parishioners, as it seemeth, see∣ing
the Church to bee very old, purpo∣sed
to take it downe, and to build it
new againe: Which they began to doe
about the yeere of our Lord God, 1456.
At what time <HI>Robet Snell</HI> and <HI>Iohn King</HI>
were Church-wardens, and continued
in the office till the end of the yeere
1467. Toward the which Building, as
it may appeare by their Accompts, <HI>Iohn
Saxton</HI> being Rector or Parson of the
said Church, gave thirty two pounds;
and afterward <HI>Richard Bowyer</HI> being
Parson, gave sixe pound and fifteene
shillings.</P>
<P>Of later dayes, to wit, <HI>Anno Domini</HI>
1594. and 35. of Queene <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> of
blessed memory, this Church yard, and
all the Buildings thereon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Church yard and Buildings supposed to be con∣cealed.</NOTE> which had
been thus long in the free possession of
the Ministers and Parishioners of the
said Church, were, through the infor∣mation
of an evill minded man, then
Tenent in the chambers, sold for con∣cealed
land; whereby the said Tene∣ment,
Church yard, and Cloysters,
were like to bee lost from the possession
of the Church, and the Ministers of the
Church to bee charged with an yeerely
rent of their Parsonage house for ever.
But the Parson and Parishioners, by a
Iudiciall proceeding then in her Maje∣sties
Court of Exchequer, cleared all
the whole Soyle from that incom∣brance:
the tryall whereof was held by
<HI>Nisi prius</HI> in the Guild-hall of <HI>London,</HI>
and the Record is kept in Master <HI>Fan∣shawes</HI>
Office for the Exchequer.</P>
<P><HI>Richard Shore,</HI> Draper, one of the
Sheriffes in the yeere 1505. gave fif∣teene
pounds to the making of a Porch
to this Church.</P>
<P>In the great East window of this
Church are the Armes of divers Gen∣tlemen,
as Benefactors: and namely,
the Armes of <HI>Lovell</HI> and <HI>Pury,</HI> quarte∣red,
and the Armes of <HI>Richard Keston,</HI>
single.</P>
<P>All the rooffing of the Church is
garnished with the Armes of one <HI>Tho∣mas
Ashehill,</HI> who had lent a great
summe of money toward the new buil∣ding
of the said Church, and was one
of the Church-wardens there, in the
yeere 1474. and lyeth buried there in
the South Chappell: His Armes also
are to be seene in the same Chappell, in
the window to the East.</P>

in Kent, and was there buried.</P>
<P>West from this <HI>Cony hope lane</HI> is the
old <HI>Iury,</HI> whereof some portion is of
<HI>Cheape Ward,</HI> as afore is shewed: at the
South end of this Lane, is the Parish
Church of S. <HI>Mary Cole-Church,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parish Church of S. <HI>Mary Cole-Church.</HI></NOTE> named
of one <HI>Cole</HI> that builded it: this Church
is builded upon a vault above ground, so
that men are forced to goe to ascend up
therunto by certain steps. I find no Mo∣numents
<PB N="276" REF="149"/>
of this Church more, than that
<HI>Henry</HI> the fourth granted licence to
<HI>William Marshall</HI> and others, to found a
Brotherhood of Saint <HI>Katharine</HI> there∣in,
because <HI>Thomas Becket</HI> and Saint <HI>Ed∣mond</HI>
the Archbishop were baptized
there. More I reade of <HI>Bordhangly lane,</HI>
to be of that Parish: and thus much for
the North side of the <HI>Poultry.</HI> The
South side of the said <HI>Poultry,</HI> begin∣ning
on the banke of the said brooke,
over-against the Parish Church of Saint
<HI>Mildred,</HI> passing up to the great Con∣duit,
hath divers faire houses, which
were sometimes inhabited by the Poul∣ters,
but now by Grocers, Haberda∣shers,
and Vpholsters.</P>
<P>Concerning other Antiquities there:
first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buckles bury of one Buc∣kle.</NOTE> is <HI>Buckles bury,</HI> so called of a Man∣nour
and Tenements pertaining to one
<HI>Buckle,</HI> who there dwelled, and kept
his Courts. This Mannor is supposed
to be the great stone-building, yet in
part remaining on the South side of the
streete, which of late time hath beene
called the <HI>Old Barge,</HI> of such a signe
hanged out, neere the gate thereof. This
Mannour, or great House, hath of long
time beene divided and letten out into
many tenements: and it hath beene a
common speech,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barges towed up Walbrook unto Buc∣kles bury.</NOTE> that when <HI>Walbrooke</HI>
did lye open, Barges were rowed out of
the <HI>Thames,</HI> or towed up so farre: and
therefore the place hath ever since been
called the <HI>Old Barge.</HI></P>
<P>Also, on the North side of this street,
directly over-gainst the said <HI>Buckles bu∣rie,</HI>
was one ancient and strong Tower
of stone the which Tower King <HI>Edward</HI>
the third, in the eighteenth of his reign,
by the name of the Kings house, called
<HI>Cornet stoure</HI> in <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cornet stoure in Buckles bury the Kings Ex∣change. Exche∣quer.</NOTE> did appoint to
be his Exchange of money, there to bee
kept. In the 29. he granted it to <HI>Frydus
Guynysane,</HI> and <HI>Landus Bardoile,</HI> Mer∣chants
of <HI>Luke,</HI> for twenty pound the
yeere. And in the 32. he gave the same
Tower to his Colledge, or free Chappel
of Saint <HI>Stephen</HI> at <HI>Westminster,</HI> by the
name of <HI>Cornet stoure</HI> at <HI>Buckles bury</HI> in
<HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>This Tower, of late yeeres, was ta∣ken
downe by one <HI>Buckle,</HI> a Grocer,
meaning, in place thereof, to have set
up and builded a goodly frame of Tim∣ber:
but the said <HI>Buckle</HI> greedily labou∣ring
to pull downe the old Tower, a
part thereof fell upon him, which so
sore bruised him, that his life was there∣by
shortened: and another that married
his widow, set up the new prepared
frame of Timber, and finished the
worke.</P>
<P>This whole streete, called <HI>Buckles bu∣rie,</HI>
on both the sides throughout, is
possessed of Grocers and Apothecaries.
Toward the west end thereof, on the
South side, breaketh out one other short
Lane,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peneritch streete.</NOTE> called in Records <HI>Peneritch street,</HI>
it reacheth but to Saint <HI>Sythes lane,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parish Church of S. Sythe Benet Shrog. Needlers lane.</NOTE> and
Saint <HI>Sythes</HI> Church is the farthest part
thereof; for by the west end of the said
Church, beginneth <HI>Needlers lane,</HI> which
reacheth to <HI>Sopers lane,</HI> as is aforesaid.
This small Parish Church of St. <HI>Syth,</HI>
hath also an addition of <HI>Bennet shorne,</HI>
(or <HI>Shrog,</HI> or <HI>Shorehog)</HI> for by all these
names have I read it, but the ancientest
is <HI>Shorne:</HI> wherefore it seemeth to take
that name of one <HI>Benedict Shorne,</HI> some∣time
a Citizen and Stockefishmonger
of <HI>London,</HI> a new builder, repairer, or
benefactor thereof, in the yeere of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>
the second: so that <HI>Shorne</HI> is but
corruptly called <HI>Shrog,</HI> and more cor∣ruptly
<HI>Shorehog.</HI></P>

night, the lowest Images round about
the said Crosse (being of Christ his re∣surrection,
of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> King <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>

broken, and defaced. Proclamation
was made, that whoso would bewray

but nothing came to light: the Image of
the blessed Virgin, at that time was

robbed of her Son, &amp; her armes broken,

her whole body was also haled with

&amp; in the yeer next following, a new
mis-shapen Son, as born out of time, all
naked, was laid in her armes, the other
Images remaining broke as afore. But
on the East side of the same Crosse, the
steppes being taken thence under the I∣mage
of Christs resurrection defaced,
was then set up a curious wrought Ta∣bernacle
of gray Marble,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Image of <HI>Diana</HI> let upon the Crosse in <HI>Cheape.</HI></NOTE> &amp; in the same

framed, set up, covered with lead, &amp; gil∣ded,
the body of the Crosse downward
cleansed of dust, the Scaffold carried
thence. About 12. nights following, the
Image of our Lady was again defaced,
by plucking off her crown, &amp; almost her
head, taking from her her naked childe,

much for the Crosse in <HI>West Cheape.</HI></P>

<HI>Polycronicon</HI> sait, that <HI>Walter Stapleton,</HI>
Bishop of <HI>Exceter,</HI> Treasurer to <HI>Edward</HI>
the 2. was by the Burgesses of <HI>London</HI>
beheaded at this Crosse, then called the
<HI>Standard,</HI> without the North doore of
S. <HI>Pauls</HI> Church, and so is it noted in o∣ther
writers, that then lived. This old
Crosse stood and remained at the East
end of the Parish Church, called S. <HI>Mi∣chael</HI>
in the Corne by <HI>Pauls gate,</HI> neer to
the North end of the <HI>Old-Exchange,</HI> till
the yeere 1390. the 13. of <HI>Richard</HI> the 2.
in place of which old Crosse then taken
down, the said Church of S. <HI>Michael</HI> was
enlarged, &amp; also a faire water-Conduit
builded about the 9. of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth.</P>
<P>In the reigne of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3. divers
Iustings were made in this streete,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iustings and Tour∣nament in <HI>West Cheape.</HI></NOTE> be∣twixt
<HI>Sopers lane</HI> &amp; the great Crosse,
namely, one in the yeer 1331. about the
21. of September, as I finde noted by
divers writers of that time. In the mid∣dle
of the City of <HI>London</HI> (say they) in a
streete called <HI>Cheap,</HI> the stone pavement
being couered with sand, that the horse
might not slide, when they strongly set
their feet to the ground, the King held a
Tournament 3. daies together with the
Nobility,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Edward</HI> the 3. held Tourna∣ment or Iusts in West <HI>Cheap</HI> 3. daies together.</NOTE> valiant men of the Realme, &amp;
other, some strange Knights. And to the
end the beholders might with the bet∣ter
ease see the same, there was a wood∣den
Scaffold erected crosse the streete,
like unto a Tower,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Queene <HI>Philip</HI> and her ladies fell from a Scaffold in <HI>Cheape.</HI></NOTE> wherein Queen <HI>Phi∣lip,</HI>
&amp; many other Ladies, richly attired
and assembled from all parts of the
Realme, did stand to behold the Justs:
but the higher frame in which the La∣dies
were placed, brake in sunder, wher∣by
they were (with some shame) forced
to fall downe, by reason whereof the
Knights and such as were underneath
were grievously hurt: wherefore the
Queen took great care to save the Car∣penters
from punishment, and through
her praiers (which she made upon her
knees) pacified the King &amp; Councell, &amp;
therby purchased great love of the peo∣ple.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A shed or standing made for the King to behold the shews in <HI>Cheape.</HI></NOTE> After which time the King caused a

<P>Before this Hospitall towards the

Chappell arched over with stone, and
thereupon the Mercers Hall, a most cu∣rious
peece of worke: Sir <HI>Iohn Allen,</HI>
Mercer, being founder of that Chap∣pell,
was there buried, but since his
Tombe is removed thence into the bo∣dy
of the Hospitall Church, &amp; his bo∣dy-roome
divided into shops, are letten
out for rēt. These Mercers were enabled
to be a Company, &amp; to purchase lands
to the value of 20. li. the yeer, the 17. of
<HI>Richard</HI> the 2. they had 3. messuages &amp;

found by inquisition before <HI>Thomas

City. <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, in the 3. of his
reigne, at the request of <HI>Iohn Coventry,
Iohn Carpenter,</HI> and <HI>William Grove,</HI> gran∣ted
to the Mercers to have a Chaplaine,
&amp; a Brotherhood, for reliefe of such of
<PB N="282" REF="152"/>
their Company, as came to decay by
misfortune on the Sea. In the yeere,
1536. on Saint <HI>Peters</HI> night, King <HI>Hen∣rie</HI>
the eighth, and Queene <HI>Iane</HI> his
wife, stood in this Mercers Hall, then
new builded, and beheld the marching
Watch of the City, most bravely set
out, sir <HI>Iohn Allen,</HI> Mercer, one of the
Kings Councell, being Maior.</P>
<P>Next beyond the <HI>Mercers Chappell,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ironmonger lane.</NOTE> and their Hall, is <HI>Ironmonger lane,</HI> so cal∣led
of Ironmongers dwelling there,
whereof I reade in the reigne of <HI>Edward</HI>
the first, &amp;c. In this Lane is the small
Parish Church of St. <HI>Martin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parish Church of S. <HI>Martins Pomary.</HI></NOTE> called <HI>Po∣mary,</HI>
upon what occasion I certainly
know not. It is supposed to be of Ap∣ples
growing, where now houses are
lately builded: for my selfe have seene
large voide places. Monuments in that
Church none to be accounted of.</P>
<P>Farther west,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Laurence lane.</NOTE> is St. <HI>Laurence lane,</HI> so
called of St. <HI>Laurence</HI> Church, which
standeth directly over-against the north
end thereof. Antiquities in this Lane I
find none other, than that among many
faire houses, there is one large Inne for
receit of Travellers, called <HI>Blossoms
Inne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Blossoms Inne.</NOTE> but corruptly <HI>Bosoms Inne,</HI> and
hath to signe S. <HI>Laurence</HI> the Deacon, in
a border of Blossomes or Flowers.</P>
<P>Then neere to the <HI>Standard</HI> in <HI>Cheape,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hony lane.</NOTE> is <HI>Hony lane,</HI> so called, not of sweetnesse
thereof, being very narrow, and some∣what
dark, but rather, of often washing
and sweeping, to keep it cleane. In this
Lane is the small Parish Church, called
<HI>Alhallowes</HI> in <HI>Hony lane:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parish Church of <HI>Alhallowes Hony lane.</HI></NOTE> There bee no
Monuments in this Church worth the
nothing. I finde, that <HI>Iohn Norman,</HI> Dra∣per,
Maior, 1453. was buried there: He
gave to the Drapers his Tenements on
the North side the said Church, they to
allow for the Beame light and Lampe,
13. shillings 4. pence yeerly, from this
Lane to the <HI>Standard.</HI> And thus much
for <HI>Cheape Ward,</HI> in the high streete of
<HI>Cheape;</HI> for it stretcheth no farther.</P>
<P>Now, for the North Wing of <HI>Cheape
Ward,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Catte-street.</NOTE> have yee <HI>Catte-streete,</HI> corruptly
called <HI>Catteten streete,</HI> which beginneth
at the North end of <HI>Ironmonger lane,</HI> and
runneth to the west end of St. <HI>Laurence</HI>
Church, as is afore shewed.</P>
<P>On the North side of this streete is
the <HI>Guild-hall,</HI> wherein the Courts for
the City be kept: namely, 1. The Court
of Common Councell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Guild-Hall,</HI> and Courts kept.</NOTE> 2. The court of
the Lord Maior &amp; his Brethren the Al∣dermen,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. Fle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</NOTE> 3. The court of Hustings, 4.
The court of Orphanes, 5. The 2. courts
of the Sheriffes, 6. The court of the
Wardmote, 7. The court of Hallmote,
8. The court of Requests, commonly cal∣led
the Court of Conscience, 9. The
Chamberlaines court for Prentises, and
making them free. This <HI>Guild-hall,</HI> saith
<HI>Robert Fabian,</HI> was begun to be builded
new in the yeere 1411. the twelfth of
<HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, by <HI>Thomas Knoles,</HI>
then Maior, &amp; his Brethren the Alder∣men:
The same was made of a little cot∣tage,
a large and great house, as now it
standeth; towards the charges whereof,
the Companies gave large benevolen∣ces.
Also offences of men were pardo∣ned
for summes of money towards this
Worke, extraordinary Fees were rai∣sed,
Fines, Amercements, and other
things imployed, during 7. yeeres, with
a continuation there of 3. yeers more, all
to be imployed to this building.</P>
<P>The first yeere of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, <HI>Iohn
Coventry</HI> and <HI>Iohn Carpentar,</HI> Executors
to <HI>Richard Whitington,</HI> gave towards
the paving of this great Hall twenty
pound, and the next yeere fifteene
pound more to the said Pavement with
hard stone of <HI>Purbecke:</HI> They also gla∣sed
some Windowes thereof, and of the
Maiors Court, on every which Win∣dow,
the Armes of <HI>Richard Whitington</HI>
are placed. The foundation of the
Maiors court was laid in the third yeere
of the reigne of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth; and of
the Porch, on the South side of the
Maiors court, in the fourth of the said
King. Then was builded the Maiors
Chamber, and the Councell Chamber,
with other roomes above the staires.</P>
<P>Having here so just occasion, speaking
of that former ancient Councell Cham∣ber,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The new Councell Chamber at the Guild-Hall, and the buil∣ding ther∣of.</NOTE> which hath continued so ever
since; I cannot but account it expedient
(as in no place better fitting) to remem∣ber
the faire and goodly new Councell
Chamber; a worthy Act and Honour,
whereby to renowne deservedly the
City for ever. The said new Councell
Chamber, with a faire Roome over the
same, appointed for a Treasury, where∣in
to preserve the Bookes and Records
<PB N="283" REF="152"/>
belonging to the Citie; and another
roome also underneath the said Cham∣ber,
reserved for necessary use and im∣ployment,
began to be builded the first
weeke after <HI>Easter,</HI> in the time of the
Maioralty of Sir <HI>Thomas Middleton,</HI>
Knight and Alderman; in the yeere of
our Lord, 1614. It was fully finished
shortly after <HI>Michaeh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as, 1615.</HI> at the
latter end of the Maioralty of Sir <HI>Tho∣mas
Hayes,</HI> Knight and Alderman. But
the Lord Maior, and the Aldermen his
brethren, kept their first Court in the
said new Councell Chamber,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Court kepe in the new Councell Chamber.</NOTE> on the
seventh day of <HI>November,</HI> in the yeere
of our Lord, 1615. Sir <HI>Iohn Iolles,</HI>
Knight and Alderman, being then Lord
Maior: By whose order and direction,
the said building was performed, from
the first beginning thereof, to the finall
finishing of the same; amounting to
the charge of 1740. pounds: than
which, no money (in my mind) could
be better bestowed, nor more to the Ci∣ties
credit and renowne.</P>
<P>Last of all, a stately Porch, entring
the great Hall, was erected, the front
thereof towards the South, being beau∣tified
with Images of stone, such as is
shewed by these verses following, made
about some thirty yeeres since, by <HI>Wil∣liam
Elderton,</HI> at that time an Atturney
in the Sheriffes Courts there:</P>
<Q><L>Though most the Images</L>
<L>be pulled downe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Verses made on the Ima∣ges over the <HI>Guild-hall</HI> gate.</NOTE></L>
<L>And none be thought</L>
<L>remaine in Towne,</L>
<L>I am sure there be</L>
<L>in <HI>London</HI> yet</L>
<L>Seven Images, such,</L>
<L>and in such a place,</L>
<L>As few or none,</L>
<L>I thinke, will hit:</L>
<L>Yet every day</L>
<L>they shew their face,</L>
<L>And thousands see them</L>
<L>every yeere,</L>
<L>But few, I thinke,</L>
<L>can tell me where:</L>
<L>Where Iesu Christ</L>
<L>aloft doth stand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Names of Images.</NOTE></L>

<L>There Iustice, Fortitude</L>
<L>and Temperance stand,</L>
<L>Where finde ye the like</L>
<L>in all this Land?</L></Q>
<P>Divers Aldermen glazed the great
Hall, and other Courts, as appeareth
by their Armes in each window. <HI>Willi∣am
Hariot,</HI> Draper, Maior, 1481. gave
forty pound to the making of two Loo∣vers
in the said Guild-hall, and toward
the glazing thereof.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kitchens by the <HI>Guild-hall.</HI></NOTE> The Kitchens, and
other houses of Office adjoyning to this
Guild-hall, were builded of later time,
to wit, about the yeere 1501. by pro∣curement
of Sir <HI>Iohn Sha,</HI> Goldsmith,
Maior, (who was the first that kept his
Feast there) towards the charges of
which worke, the Maior had of the Fel∣lowships
of the Citie (by their owne
agreement) certaine summes of money;
as, of the Mercers forty pounds; the
Grocers, twenty pounds; the Drapers,
thirty pounds; and so of the other Fel∣lowships
thorow the Citie, as they
were of power.</P>
<P>Also Widdowes, and other wel-dis∣posed
persons, gave certaine summes of
money: as, the Lady <HI>Hill,</HI> ten pounds;
the Ladie <HI>Austrie,</HI> ten pounds; and so
of many other, till the worke was fini∣shed.
Since the which time, the Maiors
Feasts have beene yeerely kept there,
which before-time had beene kept in
the Taylors Hall, and in the Grocers
Hall. <HI>Nicholas Alwin,</HI> Grocer, Maior,
1499. deceased 1505. gave by his Te∣stament,
for a hanging of Tapestrie, to
serve for principall dayes in the <HI>Guild-hall,</HI>
73. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 6. <HI>s. 8. <ABBR>d.</ABBR></HI> How this gift was
performed, I have not heard: for Exe∣cutors
of our time, having no consci∣ence,
(I speake of my own knowledge)
prove more Testaments than they per∣forme.</P>
<P>Now for the Chappell or Colledge
of our Lady <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chappell or Col∣ledge at <HI>Guild-hall.</HI> Patent.</NOTE> and of <HI>All
Saints</HI> by the <HI>Guild-Hall,</HI> called <HI>London</HI>
Colledge: I read, that the same was
builded about the yeere 1299. and that
<HI>Peter Fanelore, Adam Frauncis,</HI> and <HI>Hen∣ry
Frowicke</HI> Citizens, gave one Messuage

<PB N="284" REF="153"/>
of the Chauntry, by them founded in

and on the other house in the Pa∣rish
of S. <HI>Giles</HI> without <HI>Creplegate,</HI> in the
27. of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, was given to
them.</P>
<P>Moreover I finde, that <HI>Richard</HI> the 2.
in the 20. of his reigne, granted to <HI>Ste∣phen
Spilman,</HI> Mercer, licence to give
one messuage, three shops, and one
garden, with the appurtenances, being
in the Parish of S. <HI>Andrew Hubberd,</HI> to
the <HI>Custos</HI> and Chaplaines of the said
Chappell, and to their successors, for
their better reliefe and maintenance for
ever.</P>
<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> the 6. in the eighth of his
reigne, gave licence to <HI>Iohn Barnard, Cu∣stos,</HI>
and the Chaplains, to build of new
the said Chappell or Colledge of <HI>Guild

Skinner, Maior, founded a Chap∣laine
there: <HI>Roger Depham,</HI> Mercer, and
Sir <HI>VVilliam Langford,</HI> Knight, had also
Chaplaines there. This Chappell or
Colledge had a <HI>Custos,</HI> 7. Chaplaines,
3. Clarkes, and 4. Quiresters.</P>
<P>Monuments there have beene sundry,
as appeareth by the Tombes of Marble
yet remaining, seven in number, but all
defaced. The uppermost in the Quire,
on the South side thereof, above the
Revestrie doore, was the Tombe of <HI>Iohn
Welles,</HI> Grocer, Maior 1451. The like∣nesse
of Wels are graven on the Tombe,
on the Revestrie doore, and other pla∣ces
on that side the Quire. Also in the
glasse window, is the likenesse of
Welles, with hands elevated out of the

<HI>Welles.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iohn Welles</HI> a princi∣pall bene∣factor to <HI>Guild hall</HI> Colledge.</NOTE> I found his Armes also
in the South glasse window: all which
doe shew, that the East end and South

the Revestire, were by him both builded

Quire, the Tombe of <HI>Thomas Knesworth,</HI>
Fishmonger, Maior 1505. who decea∣sed
1505. who decea∣sed

Two other Tombes lower

knowne: <HI>Richard Stomin</HI> is written in
the window by the Haberdasher. Vnder
flat stones doe lye divers <HI>Custos</HI> of the

<P>Adjoyning to this Chappell on the

<P>These Bookes (as it is said) were, in
the reigne of <HI>Edward</HI> the 6. sent for by
<HI>Edward</HI> Duke of <HI>Somerset,</HI> Lord Prote∣ctor,
with promise to be restored short∣ly:
men laded from thence three Car∣ries
with them, but they were never re∣turned.
This Library was builded by
the Executors of <HI>R. VVhitington,</HI> and by
<HI>VV. Bury.</HI> The Armes of <HI>VVhitington</HI>
are placed on the one side in the stone-worke:
and two letters, to wit, <HI>W.</HI> and

bone of a man (as it is taken) and also a
tooth of a very great bignesse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The tooth of some monstrous Fish as I take it.</NOTE> hanged
up, for shew, in chaines of iron, upon a
<PB N="285" REF="153"/>
pillar of stone; the tooth (being about
the bignesse of a mans fist) is long since
conveyed from thence: the thigh or
shanke bone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A shanke bone of 25. inches long, of a man, as is said, but might be of an Ele∣phant.</NOTE> of 25. inches in length by
the Rule, remaineth yet fastned to a
post of timber, and is not so much to be
noted for the length, as for the thicknes,
hardnesse and strength thereof; for
when it was hanged on the stone pillar,
it fretted (with moving) the said pillar,
and was not it selfe fretted, nor (as see∣meth)
is not yet lightned, by remaining
dry: but where or when this bone was
first found or discovered, I have not

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>Ext to <HI>Cheape</HI> Ward, on

Ward.</P>
<P>On the North side lyeth <HI>Coleman street,</HI>
whereof the Ward taketh name, whol∣ly
on both sides North to <HI>London</HI> wall,
and from that North end along by the
Wall, and <HI>Mooregate,</HI> East, to the course
of <HI>Walbrooke.</HI> And againe, from <HI>Coleman
street,</HI> West, to the Iron grates: and
these be the bounds of this Ward.</P>
<P>Antiquities therein to be noted, are
these:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lothbery.</NOTE> First, the street of <HI>Lothbery, Lath∣bery,</HI>
or <HI>Loadbery,</HI> (for by all these names
have I read it) tooke the name (as it see∣meth)
of a <HI>Bery,</HI> or Court of old time
there kept, but by whom, it is growne
out of memorie. This street is possessed
(for the most part) by Founders, that
cast Candlestickes, Chafingdishes,
Spice Morters, and such like Copper or
Laten works, and doe afterward turne
them with the foot, and not with the
wheele, to make them smooth and
bright, with turning and scratting, (as
some doe terme it) making a lothsome
noise to the by-passers, that have not
beene used to the like; and therefore by
them disdainedly called <HI>Lothburie.</HI> On
the South side of this street, amongst
the Founders, be some faire houses and
large, for Merchants; namely, one that
of old time was the Iewes Synagogue,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Iewes</HI> Syna¦gogue.</NOTE> which was defaced by the Citizens of
<HI>London,</HI> after that they had slaine 700.
Iewes, and spoiled the residue of their
goods, in the yeere 1262. the 47. of <HI>H.</HI>
the 3. And not long after, in the yeere
1291. King <HI>Edward</HI> the first banished
the remnant of the Iewes out of <HI>England,</HI>
as is afore shewed.</P>
<P>The said Synagogue being so sup∣pressed,
certaine Friers got possession
thereof: For in the yeere 1257. (saith
<HI>Mathew Paris)</HI> there were seene in <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
a new order of Friers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fratres de Saccae, <HI>or</HI> de poeniten∣tia.</NOTE> called <HI>De Poe∣nitentia
Iesu,</HI> or <HI>Fratres de Sacca,</HI> because
they were apparelled in Sackcloth, who
had their house in <HI>London,</HI> neere unto
<HI>Aldersgate,</HI> without the gate, and had li∣cence
of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, in the 54. of
his reigne, to remove from thence to a∣ny
other place: and in the 56. hee gave
unto them this Iewes Synagogue. After
which time, <HI>Eleanor</HI> the Queene, wife
to <HI>Edward</HI> the first, tooke into her pro∣tection,
and warranted unto the Prior
and brethren <HI>De poenitentia Iesu Christi</HI>
of <HI>London,</HI> the said land and building in
<HI>Cole-church street,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cole-church street, <HI>or</HI> Old Iew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e.</NOTE> in the parish of Saint
<HI>Olave</HI> in the <HI>Iury,</HI> &amp; S. <HI>Margaret</HI> in <HI>Loth∣burie,</HI>
by her granted, with consent of
<HI>Stephen de Fulborn,</HI> Vnder-warden of the
Bridge-house, and other brethren of
that house: for threescore Markes of
Silver, which they had received of the
said Prior and brethren of repentance,
toward the building of the said Bridge.
This order of Friers gathered many good
scholars, and multiplyed in number ex∣ceedingly,
untill the Councell at <HI>Lyons,</HI>
by the which it was decreed, that (from
that time forth) there should no more
Orders of begging Friers be permitted,
but onely the foure Orders; to wit, the
<PB N="288" REF="155"/>
<HI>Dominicke</HI> or Preachers, the <HI>Minorites</HI>
or gray Friers, the <HI>Carmelites</HI> or white
Friers, and the <HI>Augustines:</HI> and so from
that time the begging Friers decreased
and fell to nothing.</P>
<P>Now it followed, that in the yeere
1305. <HI>Robert Fitzwalter</HI> requested and
obtained of the said King <HI>Edward</HI> the
first,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ro. Fitz∣walter</HI> his house.</NOTE> that the same Friers of the Sacke,
might assigne to the said <HI>Robert</HI> their
Chappell or Church, of old time called
the Synagogne of the Iewes, neere ad∣joyning
to the then mansion place of
the same <HI>Robert,</HI> which was in place
where now standeth the Grocers Hall:
and the said Synagogue was at the
North corner of the <HI>Old Iewry. Robert
Large,</HI> Mercer, Maior, in the yeere 1439.
kept his Maioraltie in this house, and
dwelled there untill his dying day.</P>
<P>This house standeth and is of two
Parishes, as opening into <HI>Lothbury,</HI> of
Saint <HI>Margarets</HI> Parish, and opening
into the <HI>Old Iewry,</HI> of Saint <HI>Olaves</HI> Pa∣rish.
The said <HI>Robert Large</HI> gave libe∣rally

<P><HI>Hugh Clopton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Wind mill Ta∣verne in the old <HI>Iu∣rie.</HI></NOTE> Mercer, Maior, 1492.

them was stricken by a Christian, which
some unruly people perceiving, fell up∣on
them, beat them to their houses, and
brent them therein, or slew them at
their comming out.</P>
<P>Also the Iewes at <HI>Norwich, S. Ed∣mondsbury,

were robbed and spoiled; and at <HI>Yorke,</HI>
to the number of 500. besides Women

proffered money to be in surety of
their lives, but the Christians would
not take it: whereupon they cut the
throats of their owne wives and chil∣dren,
and cast them over the walles on
the Christians heads, and then entring
the Kings lodging, they burned both
the house and themselves.</P>
<P>King <HI>Iohn,</HI> in the eleventh of his reign,
commanded all the Iewes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King <HI>Iohn</HI> tormen∣ted the Iewes.</NOTE> both men

have all their money: some of them

many wayes, would not ran∣some

(every day) one of his great teeth to be

and then he gave the King tenne thou∣sand

<PB N="298" REF="160"/>
South end thereof, is <HI>Bakewell Hall,</HI> cor∣ruptly
called <HI>Blackwell Hall.</HI> Concer∣ning
the originall whereof, I have heard
divers opinions, which I over-passe as
fables, without colour of truth: for
though the same seemed a Building of
great antiquity, yet (in mine opinion)
the foundation thereof was first laid
since the Conquest of <HI>William,</HI> Duke of
<HI>Normandy:</HI> for the same was builded
upon Vaults of stone, which stone was
brought from <HI>Cane</HI> in <HI>Normandy.</HI> The
like of that of <HI>Pauls</HI> Church, builded by
<HI>Mauritius</HI> and his successors, Bishops of
<HI>London.</HI> But that this house hath beene
a Temple, or Iewish Synagogue (as
some have fantasied) I allow not, seeing
that it had no such forme of roundnesse,
or other likenesse. Neither had it the
forme of a Church, for the assembly of
Christians, which are builded East and
West: but contrariwise, the same was
builded North and South, and in forme
of a Noble mans house: and therefore
the best opinion (in my judgement) is,
that it was (of old time) belonging to
the Family of the <HI>Bassings,</HI> which was in
this Realme a name of great antiquity
and renowne, and that it bare also the
name of that Family, and was called
therfore <HI>Bassings Haugh,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bassings Hall.</NOTE> or <HI>Hall.</HI> Where∣unto
I am the rather induced, for that
the Armes of that Family were (of old
time) so abundantly placed in sundry
parts of that house,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Armes of the <HI>Bas∣sings.</HI></NOTE> even in the stone∣worke,
but more especially on the wals
of the Hall, which carried a continuall
painting of them on every side so close
together, as one Escocheon could bee
placed by another, which I my selfe
have often seene and noted, before the
old Building was taken downe. These
Arms were a Gerond of twelve points,
Gold and Azure.<NOTE PLACE="marg">How <HI>Bas∣sings Hall Ward</HI> took that name</NOTE> Of the <HI>Bassings</HI> there∣fore,

<P>This than was afterwards Maior, in

this Family is worne out, and hath left

<P>Now how <HI>Bakewell Hall</HI> tooke that

reade, that <HI>Thomas Bakewell</HI> dwelled in

third, and that in the 20. of <HI>Richard</HI> the
second, the said King, for the summe of
fifty pounds, which the Maior and the
Cōmonalty had payed into the Hana∣par,
granted licence, so much as was in
him, to <HI>Iohn Frosh, William Parker,</HI> and
<HI>Stephen Spilman</HI> (Citizens and Mercers)
that they, the said Messuage, called

<HI>Bakewell Hall,</HI> and one Garden, with the

of <HI>Bassings Haugh,</HI> and of St. <HI>Lau∣rence</HI>
in the <HI>Iewry</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and one
Messuage, two Shops, and one Garden,
in the said Parish of S. <HI>Michael,</HI> which
they held of the King in Burgage,
might give and assigne to the Maior

<P>This <HI>Bakewell Hall</HI> thus established,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bakewell Hall</HI> a Market place for woollen clothes.</NOTE>
hath beene long since imployed, as a

and in the 22. <HI>Drew Barringtine</HI> being

<P>This house (of late yeeres) growing
ruinous, &amp; in danger of falling, <HI>Richard

gave towards the new building of the

<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bakewell Hall</HI> new builded.</NOTE> Whereupon the old <HI>Bakewell Hall</HI>

the Towne ditch on the South, and cer∣taine
Gardens on the North, almost to
<HI>Moregate;</HI> at the East end of which lane
is a Pot-makers house, which house,
with all other the Gardens, Houses, and
Allies on that side to More-fields, till
yee come to a Bridge and Cow-house,
neere unto <HI>Fensbury</HI> Court, is all of <HI>Cre∣plegate</HI>
VVard.</P>
<P>Of these More-fields you have former∣ly
read,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An. 1477. Rose Ioccline</HI> then being L. Maior.</NOTE> what a moorish rotten ground
they were, unpassable, but for Caws∣waies
purposely made to that intent;
what they were also in our owne neerer
times of memory, even till Sir <HI>Leonard
<PB N="302" REF="162"/>
Hallyday</HI> was Lord Maior of <HI>London,</HI> I
am very well assured many doe perfect∣ly
remember: And what they are now
at this instant, by the honourable cost
and care of this City, and the industri∣ous
paines and diligence of that worthy
Citizen, Master <HI>Leate,</HI> wee all (to our
continuall comfort) doe evidently be∣hold.
M. <HI>Iohn Speed,</HI> my especiall kinde
friend; acquainted me with the draught
of a Mappe, done after that true shape
and modell, as at the first (by the fore∣named
Gentleman) they were inten∣ded,
and laboured with the then Lord
Maior, and Court of Aldermen, that the
same might have bin accordingly effe∣cted.
But how it was prevented, I know
not, only I purposed to have beene at so
much charge, as to have had that Map
(in some apt &amp; convenient forme) prin∣ted
in this booke: but that I could not
attaine thereto; being promised, that at
the next impression I shall have it.</P>
<P>For the Walkes themselves, and con∣tinuall
care of the City, to have them
in that comely &amp; worthy maner main∣tained:
I am certainly perswaded, that
our thankfulnesse to God being first
truely performed, they are no meane
cause of preserving health and whole∣some
ayre to the City, and such an eter∣nall
honour thereto, as no iniquity of
time shall ever be able to deface.</P>
<P>Then to turne backe againe through
the said Posterne lane to <HI>More lane,</HI>
which <HI>More lane,</HI> with all the Allies and
buildings there, is of this Ward. After
that is <HI>Grubstreete,</HI> more than halfe
thereof to the streightning of the street,
next is <HI>White-crosse</HI> street, up to the end
of <HI>Beech lane;</HI> and then <HI>Red-crosse</HI> street
wholly, with a part of <HI>Golding lane,</HI> even
to the Posts there placed, as a bounder.</P>
<P>Then is <HI>Beech lane</HI> before spoken of,
the East side of the <HI>Red-crosse,</HI> and the
<HI>Barbican streete,</HI> more than halfe there∣of,
toward <HI>Aldersgate street,</HI> and so have
you all the bounds of <HI>Creplegate</HI> VVard
without the wals.</P>
<P>Now for Antiquities and Ornaments
in this Ward, to be noted: I finde, first
at the meeting of the corners of the <HI>Old
Iury,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Pumpe at the cor∣ner of <HI>Al∣derman-bury</HI> street.</NOTE> <HI>Milkstreet, Lad lane,</HI> and <HI>Alderman
bury,</HI> there was (of old time) a faire
Well with two Buckets, of late yeeres
converted to a Pumpe. How <HI>Alderman
bury streete</HI> took that name, many fables
have been bruted, all which I overpasse,
as not worthy the counting: but to bee
short, I say, this streete tooke the name
of <HI>Aldermans bury</HI> (which is to say, a
Court) there kept in their <HI>Bery,</HI> or Court
Hall, now called the <HI>Guild Hall,</HI> which
Hall (of old time) stood on the East side
of the same street, not far from the West
end of <HI>Guild Hall</HI> now used.</P>
<P>Touching the Antiquity of this old
<HI>Aldermans bury</HI> or Court, I have not
read other,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Alderman bury <HI>Hall by</HI> Alderman bury <HI>Church.</HI></NOTE> than that <HI>Richard Renery,</HI> one
of the Sheriffes of <HI>London,</HI> in the first of
<HI>Richard</HI> the first, which was in the yeere
of Christ, 1189. gave to the Church or
Saint <HI>Mary</HI> at <HI>Osney</HI> by <HI>Oxford,</HI> certaine
ground and rents in <HI>Alderman bury</HI> of
<HI>London,</HI> as appeareth by the Register of
that Church, as is also entred into the
<HI>Hoistings</HI> of the <HI>Guild Hall</HI> in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>This old Bery, Court, or Hall conti∣nued,
and the Courts of the Maior
&amp; Aldermen were continually holden
there, untill the new Bery, Court, or
<HI>Guild hall</HI> that now is, was builded &amp; fi∣nished,
which Hall was first begun to be
founded in the yeere 1411. and was not
fully finished in 20. yeers after. I my self
have seene the ruines of the old Court
Hall, in <HI>Alderman-bury streete,</HI> which of
late hath beene imployed as a Carpen∣ters
yard, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In this <HI>Alderman-bury street</HI> be divers
faire houses on both the sides, meete for
Merchants or men of worship, &amp; in the
midst therof is a faire Conduit, made at
the charges of <HI>W. Eastfield,</HI> sometime
Maior, who took order as well for water
to be conveyed from <HI>Teyborne,</HI> &amp; for the
building of this Conduit, not far distant
from his dwelling house; as also for a
<HI>Standard</HI> of sweet water to be erected in
<HI>Fleetstreet,</HI> all which was done by his Ex∣ecutors,
as elsewhere is shewed.</P>
<P>Then is the Parish Church of S. <HI>Mary
Aldermanbury,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parish Church of S. <HI>Mary Alderman∣bury.</HI></NOTE> a faire Church, with a
Church-yard &amp; Cloister adjoyning, in
the which Cloister is hanged &amp; fastned
a shanke-bone of a man (as is said) very
great,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shanke∣bone of a man 28. inches &amp; a halfe long.</NOTE> and larger by 3. inches &amp; a halfe,
than that which hangeth in S. <HI>Laurence</HI>
Church in the <HI>Iurie;</HI> for it is in length
28. inches and a halfe of assise, but not
so hard and steely, like as the other, for
the same is light, and somewhat pory
<PB N="303" REF="162"/>
and spongy. This bone is said to bee
found amongst the bones of men remo∣ved
from the Charnell house of <HI>Pauls,</HI>
or rather from the Cloyster of <HI>Pauls</HI>
Church: of both which reports I doubt,
for that the late <HI>Reyne Wolfe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Reyne Wolfe</HI> a grave Antiqua∣ry, colle∣cted the great Chroni∣cles, in∣creased, &amp; published by his Ex∣ecutors, under the name of <HI>Ralph Ho∣lenshead.</HI></NOTE> Stationer
(who payd for the carriage of those
bones from the Charnell to the <HI>More∣fields)</HI>
told mee of some thousands of
Carre loads and more to bee conveyed,
whereof he wondred; but never told of
any such bone in either place to bee
found, neither would the same have bin
easily gotten from him, if he had heard
thereof, except he had reserved the like
for himself, being the greatest preserver
of antiquities in those parts for his time.</P>
<P>True it is, that this bone (from whence
soever it came) being of a man, as the
forme sheweth) must needes bee mon∣strous,
and more than after the propor∣tion
of five shanke bones of any man
now living amongst us. There lye buri∣ed

<P>Then next is <HI>Woodstreet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Woodstreet.</NOTE> by what rea∣son
so called, I know not; true it is,
that (of old time) according to a De∣cree
made in the reigne of <HI>Richard</HI> the
first, the houses in <HI>London</HI> were builded
of stone, for defence of fire, which kind
of building was used for two hundred
yeeres or more; but of later time, for
the winning of ground, taken downe,
and houses of timber were set up in
place. It seemeth therefore, that this
street hath beene of the later building,
all of timber, (for not one house of stone
hath beene knowne there) and there∣fore
called <HI>Woodstreet;</HI> otherwise it
might take the name of some builder
or owner thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Tho. Wood,</HI> one of the Sheriffes, in
<PB N="308" REF="165"/>
the yeere 1491. dwelled there: he was
an especiall Benefactor towards the

end, which is called <HI>Gold-smiths
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> garnished with the likenesse of

<P>On the East side of this street is one
of the Prison houses,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> pertaining to the

character of the antiquity of it,
is to be seene in the manner of the tur∣ning
of the Arches in the windowes,

appeares in the <HI>Romane</HI> bricks, here and
there inlayed amongst the stones of the

Church is at least of as ancient a stan∣ding,
as King <HI>Adelstane</HI> the <HI>Saxon,</HI> who,
as the Tradition sayes, had his house at

<P>On the East side of this <HI>Foster lane,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gold∣smiths Hall.</NOTE> at

Hall, a proper house, but not large. And
therefore to say that <HI>Bartholomew Read,</HI>
Goldsmith, Maior in the yeere, 1502.
kept such a feast in this Hall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">R. Grafton.</NOTE> as some
have fabuled, is farre incredible, and
altogether unpossible, considering the
smalnesse of the Hall, and number of the
<PB N="324" REF="173"/>
guests, which as they say, were more
than 100. persons of great estate. For
the messes and dishes of meats to them
served, the paled Parke in the same
Hall, furnished with fruitfull trees,
beasts of Venery, and other circumstan∣ces
of that pretended feast well weigh∣ed,
<HI>Westminster</HI> Hall would hardly have
sufficed; and therefore I will over-passe
it, and note somewhat of principall
Goldsmiths.</P>
<P>First, J reade, that <HI>Leofstane,</HI> Gold∣smith,
was Provost of this City, in the
reigne of <HI>Henry</HI> the first. Also, that
<HI>Henry Fitz Alewin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The first Maior of <HI>London</HI> was a Gold∣smith.</NOTE> <HI>Fitz Leafstane,</HI> Gold∣smith,
was Maior of <HI>London,</HI> in the first

Rocksly,</HI> chiefe Say-master of all the
Kings Mints within <HI>England</HI> (and there∣fore
by my conjecture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Principall men of the City, Gold∣smiths.</NOTE> a Goldsmith)
was Maior in the third of <HI>Edward</HI> the
first, and continued Maior seven yeeres
together. Then <HI>William Faringdon,</HI>
Goldsmith, Alderman of <HI>Faringdon</HI>
Ward, one of the Sheriffes, 1281. the
ninth of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, who was a
Goldsmith, as appeareth in record, and
shall bee shewed in <HI>Faringdon</HI> Ward.
Then <HI>Nicholas Faringdon</HI> his son, Gold∣smith,
Alderman of <HI>Faringdon</HI> Ward,
foure times Maior in the reigne of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>
the second, &amp;c. For the rest of la∣ter
time are more manifestly knowne;
and therefore I leave them: the men of
this mystery were incorporated or con∣firmed
in the sixteenth of <HI>Richard</HI> the
second.</P>

as appeareth in a booke written
by a Notary of that house, about the

was led by an Officer towards the <HI>Guild
hall</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> there came out of <HI>Panyer

him from the Officer, brought him into

that place. But the same day <HI>Philip
Malpas,</HI> and <HI>Robert Marshall,</HI> then She∣riffes

the said Church, and forcibly tooke out

fled; led them fettred to the Compter,
and from thence chained by the neckes
to <HI>Newgate:</HI> of which violent taking,
the Deane and Chapter in large man∣ner
complained to the King, and requi∣red
him as their Patron, to defend their
priviledges, like as his Predecessors had
done, &amp;c. All which complaint and
sute, the Citizens by their councell,
<HI>Markam,</HI> Serjeant at the Law, <HI>Iohn
Carpenter,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Argument against priviledge challen∣ged by the Deane of S. <HI>Martins.</HI></NOTE> late Common Clarke of the

offering to prove, that the said place of

liberty as was pretended; namely, <HI>Car∣penter</HI>
offered to lose his live-lode, if that
Church had more immunity than the
least Church in <HI>London:</HI> notwithstanding,
after long debating of this con∣troversie,
by the Kings commande∣ment,
and assent of his Councell in the

Treasurer sent a Writ unto the Sheriffs
of <HI>London,</HI> charging them to bring the
said five persons, with the cause of their
taking, and withholding afore the King
in his Chancery, on the Vigill of <HI>All∣hallowes.</HI>
On which day, the said She∣riffes,
with the Recorder and Councell
of the City, brought and delivered
them accordingly, afore the said Lords,
whereas the Chancelor, after hee had

sent them to Saint <HI>Martins,</HI> there to a∣bide

the which time, to wit, in the yeere

Sermon, he made a fruitfull and godly
Exhortation to the rich, to be mercifull
unto the poore: and also to move such
as were in authority, to travaile by some
charitable way and meanes, to comfort
and relieve them. Wherupon, the Kings
Majestie (being a Prince of such toward∣nesse
and vertue for his yeeres, as <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
before never brought forth, and
being also so well retained and brought
vp in all godly knowledge, as well by

also by his vertuous and learned School∣masters)
was so carefull of the good go∣vernement
of the Realme, and chiefely
to doe and prefer such things as most e∣specially
touched the honour of Al∣mighty
God. And understanding, that
a great number of poore people did
swarme in this Realme, and chiefly in
the Citie of <HI>London,</HI> and that no good
order was taken for them, did suddenly
(and of himselfe) send to the said Bi∣shop,
as soone as his Sermon was ended,
willing him not to depart, untill that he
had spoken with him. And this that I
now write, was the very report of the
said Bishop <HI>Ridley,</HI> who (according to
the Kings command) gave his atten∣dance.
And so soone as the Kings Maje∣stie
was at leasure he called for him, and
caused him to come unto him in a great
Gallery at <HI>Westminster,</HI> where (to his
knowledge, and the King likewise told
him so) there was present no more per∣sons
than they two; and therefore made
him sit downe in one Chayre, and hee
himselfe in another, which (as it see∣med)
were before the comming of the
Bishop there purposely set, and caused
the Bishop, maugre his teeth) to be co∣vered,
and then entred communication
with him in this manner:</P>
<P>First, giving him hearty thankes for
his Sermon and good Exhortation: hee
therein rehearsed such speciall things
as he had noted, and that so many, that
the Bishop said:</P>
<P>Truely, truely <HI>(for that commonly
was his Oath)</HI> I could never have thought
that excellency to have beene in his Grace,
but that I beheld, and heard it in him.</P>
<P>At the last the Kings Majesty much
commended him for his Exhortation,
for the reliefe of the poore.</P>
<P>But my Lord <HI>(quoth he)</HI> you willed such
as are in authority to bee carefull thereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A most vertuous and noble saying of King <HI>Edw.</HI> to Bishop <HI>Ridley.</HI></NOTE>

Wherein, I thinke you meane mee,
for I am in highest place; and therefore am
the first that must make answer unto God
for my negligence, if I should not bee

expresse Commandement of Almighty God,

members, for whom wee must make an ac∣count
unto him. And truly, my Lord, I
am (before all things else) most willing to
travaile that way, and I doubting nothing
of your long and approved wisedome and
learning, who having such good zeale, as
wisheth helpe unto them; but also that you
have had some conference with others, what
waies are best to be taken therein, the which
I am desirous to understand: and therefore I
pray you to say your minde.</P>
<P>The Bishop thinking least of that
matter, and being amazed, to heare the
wisedome &amp; earnest zeale of the King,
was (as hee said himselfe) so astonied,
that hee could not well tell what to say.
But, after some pause, said, That hee
thought (at this present) for some en∣trance
to bee had, it were good to pra∣ctise
with the City of <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Citi∣zens of <HI>London</HI> moved to be assi∣stants in this chari∣table acti∣on.</NOTE> because
the number of the poore there are very
great, and the Citizens also are many
and wise; and hee doubted not but that
they were also both pitifull and merci∣full;
as the Maior and his Brethren, and
other the Worshipfull of the said City.
And that if it would please the Kings
Majesty to direct his gracious Letters
unto the Maior of <HI>London,</HI> willing him
to call unto him such assistants as hee
should thinke meete, to consult of this
matter, for some order to bee taken
therein; hee doubted not but good
would follow thereon. And hee him∣selfe
promised the King to be one him∣selfe
that should earnestly travaile
therein.</P>
<P>The King (forth-with) not onely
granted his Letter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The kings letter sent by the Bi∣shop to the Lord, Maior of <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> but made the Bi∣shop
tarry untill the same was written,
and his hand and Signet set thereto:
And commanded the Bishop not onely
to deliver the said Letter himselfe; but
also to signifie unto the Maior, that it
was the Kings especiall request and ex∣presse
commandement, that the Maior
should therein travell; and so soone as
he might conveniently, give him know∣ledge
how far he had proceeded there∣in.
The Bishop was so joyous of the
having of this Letter, and that now hee
had an occasion to travell in so good a
matter, wherein hee was marvellous
zealous, that nothing could have more
pleased and delighted him: wherefore
the same night hee came to the Lord
Maior of <HI>London,</HI> who was the Sir <HI>Ri∣chard
Dobbs,</HI> Knight, and delivered the
Kings Letter, and shewed his message
with effect.</P>
<P>The Lord Maior not only joyously re∣ceived
this Letter:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The rea∣dinesse of the Lord Maior to preferre this good deede.</NOTE> but with all speede
agreed to set forward the matter; for he
also favoured it very much. And the
next day, being Munday, hee desired
the Bishop of <HI>London</HI> to dine with him,
and against that time the Maior promi∣sed
to send for such men, as he thought
meetest to talke of this matter, and so
he did. He sent first for 2. Aldermen
and 6. Commoners, and afterward more
were appointed, to the number of 24.
In the end, after sundry meetings (for
by the meanes and good diligence of
the Bishop, it was well followed) they
agreed upon a Booke that they had de∣vised,
wherein first they considered on
nine speciall kindes and sorts of poore
people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9. Sorts of poore people distingui∣shed into 3. degrees.</NOTE> and those they brought into
these three Degrees:
<LIST>
<HEAD>Three degrees of Poore.</HEAD>
<ITEM>1. The poore by impotency.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Poore by casualty.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Thriftlesse poore.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>1. The Poore by Impotency are also
divided into three kindes; that is to
say:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The fatherlesse poore mans childe.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The aged, blinde, and lame.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The diseased person by Leprosie,
Dropsie, &amp;c.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>2. The Poore by Casualty are likewise
of three kindes; that is to say:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The wounded Souldier.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The decayed Hous-holder.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The visited with any grievous
disease.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>3. The Thristlesse Poore are 3. kindes
in like manner; that is to say:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Riotour, that consumeth all.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Vagabond, that will abide in
no place.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Idle person, as Strumpets
and others.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>For these sorts of Poore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first beginning of Hospi∣tals.</NOTE> three seve∣rall
houses were provided: First, for the
Innocent and Fatherlesse, which is the
<PB N="344" REF="183"/>
Beggars childe, and is (indeed) the
seed and breeder of beggary, they pro∣vided
the house that was the late Gray
Friers in <HI>London,</HI> and called it by the
name of Christs Hospitall, where poore
children are trained up in the know∣ledge
of God, and some vertuous exer∣cises,
to the overthrow of beggary.</P>
<P>For the second degree was provided
the Hospitals of Saint <HI>Thomas</HI> in <HI>South∣warke,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The first begin∣ning of S. <HI>Thom.</HI> and S. <HI>Bartholm.</HI> Hospitals.</NOTE>
and Saint <HI>Bartholomew</HI> in VVest
<HI>Smithfield,</HI> where are continually (at
least) 200. diseased persons, which are
not only there lodged and cured, but
also sed and nourished.</P>
<P>For the third degree they provided
<HI>Bridewell,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The first begin∣ning of <HI>Bridewell,</HI></NOTE> where the vagabond and idle
Strumpet is chastifed, and compelled
to labour, to the overthrow of the vici∣ous
life of idlenesse.</P>
<P>They provided also for the honest de∣cayed
House-holder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reliefe for decay∣ed house-holders &amp; Lazers.</NOTE> that he should be
relieved at home at his house, and in
the Parish where hee dwelled, by a
weekly reliefe and pension. And in
like manner they provided for the
Lazer, to keepe him out of the City,
from clapping of dishes and ringing of
Bels, to the great trouble of the Citi∣zens,
and also to the dangerous infecti∣on
of maney; that they should be relie∣ved
at home at their houses, by severall
pensions.</P>
<P>Now after this good order taken,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king acquain∣ted with the Cities furthe∣rance.</NOTE>
and the Citizens (by such meanes as
were devised) willing to further the
same: the report thereof was made to
the Kings Majesty, and his Grace (for
the advancement thereof) was not on∣ly
willing to grant such as should be O∣verseers
and Governours of the said
houses, a Corporation and authority
for the government of them: but also
required, that hee might bee accounted
as the chiefe Founder and Patron there∣of.</P>
<P>And for the furtherance of the said
worke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">K. <HI>Edward.</HI> the sixth Founder of the Hospitals in <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> and continuall maintenance of
the same; hee of his me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> mercy and
goodnesse granted, that whereas (be∣fore)

which was rather the maintenance of
beggary, than any reliefe to the poore:
gave the same lands, being first surren∣dred
by the Master and Fellowes there
(which lands were of the yeerly value
of 600. pounds) unto the City of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
for the maintenance of the founda∣tion
aforesaid.</P>
<P>And for a further reliefe, a Petition
being made to the Kings Majesty, for a
licence to take in Mortmaine, or other∣wise
without licence, lands to a certaine
yeerly value, and a space left in the Pa∣tent,
for his Grace to put in what
summe it would please him: Hee loo∣king
on the voide place, called for pen
and inke, and with his own hand wrote
this summe, in these words, 4000.
<HI>Markes by the yeere,</HI> and then said in the
hearing of his Councell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The words of a blessed King.</NOTE> <HI>Lord, I yeeld
thee most hearty thankes, that thouhast gi∣ven

established, he lived not above

it.</P>

truely and painfully labouring for his

lands and tenements in <HI>Westminster,</HI>
to the yeerly value of forty and foure
pounds. And having no childe, with
the consent of his wife (who survived

gave the same lands wholly to Christs

<P>In the yeere 1087. this Church of S.
<HI>Paul</HI> was burnt with fire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. <HI>Pauls</HI> Church burnt.</NOTE> and therewith
the most part of the Citie: which fire
began at the entrie of the West gate,
and consumed the East gate. <HI>Mauricius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Foundati∣on of the new Church of S. <HI>Paul</HI> builded.</NOTE>
then Bishop, began therefore the foun∣dation
of a new Church of S. <HI>Paul;</HI> a
worke, that men (of that time) judged
would never have beene finished, it was
to them so wonderfull, for length and
breadth; and also the same was builded
upon Arches (or Vaults) of stone, for de∣fence
of fire; which was a manner of
worke (before that time) unknowne to
the people of this Nation, and then
brought in by the <HI>French:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Stone brought from <HI>Cane</HI> in <HI>Nor∣mandy.</HI></NOTE> and the stone
was fetcht from <HI>Cane</HI> in <HI>Normandy.</HI> This
<HI>Mauricius</HI> deceased in the yeere, 1107.</P>
<P><HI>Richard Beaumor</HI> succeeded him in the
Bishopricke, who did wonderfully in∣crease
the said Church, purchasing (of
his own cost) the large Streets &amp; Lanes
about it, wherein were wont to dwell
many Law-people; which ground hee
began to compasse about with a strong
wall of stone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wall a∣bout <HI>Pauls</HI> Church-yard.</NOTE> and gates. King <HI>Henry</HI>
the first gave to the said <HI>Richard</HI> so
much of the Mote (or Wall) of the Ca∣stle,
on the <HI>Thames</HI> side, to the South, as
should bee needfull to make the said
Wall of the Church, and so much as
should suffice to make a Wall without
the way on the North side, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It should seeme, that this <HI>Richard</HI> in∣closed
but two sides of the said Church
or Cemitory of Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> to wit, the
South and North side: for King <HI>Edw.</HI> the
second, in the 10. of his reigne, granted,
<PB N="353" REF="187"/>
that the said Church-yard should bee
inclosed with a wall, where it wanted,
for the Murthers and Robberies that
were there committed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The com∣mon Bell in <HI>Pauls</HI> Church-yard, rung for the calling together of the Ci∣tizens to their Folke-motes.</NOTE> But the Citi∣zens
then claimed the East part of the
Church-yard, to be the place of assem∣bly
to their Folke-motes; and that the
great Steeple, there situate, was to that
use, their common Bell, which being
there rung, all the Inhabitants of the
City might heare and come together.
They also claimed the West side, that
they might there assemble themselves
together, with the Lord of <HI>Baynards</HI>
Castle, for view of their Armour, in
defence of the City. This matter was in
the Tower of <HI>London</HI> referred to <HI>Harvi∣us
de Stanton,</HI> and his fellow Iustices <HI>Ite∣nerantes:</HI>
but I finde not the decision or
judgement of that controversie.</P>
<P>True it is, that <HI>Edward</HI> the third, in
the 17. of his reigne, gave commande∣ment
for the finishing of that VVall:
which was then performed, and to this
day it continueth; although now on
both the sides (to wit, within and with∣out)
it be hidden with dwelling houses.</P>
<P><HI>Richard Beaumor</HI> deceased in the yeere
1127. and his successors (in processe of
time) performed the worke begun.</P>
<P>The Steeple of this Church was buil∣ded
and finished in the yeere 1222.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pauls</HI> stee∣ple.</NOTE> The
Crosse on the said Steeple fell downe,
and a new was set up in the yeere 1314.</P>
<P>The new worke of <HI>Pauls</HI> (so called) at
the East end above the Quire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The new worke of <HI>Paul</HI> in the East.</NOTE> was be∣gun
in the yeer 1251. <HI>Henry Lacy,</HI> Earle
of <HI>Lincolne,</HI> Constable of <HI>Chester,</HI> and
<HI>Custos</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> in his time was a
great Benefactor to this worke, and was
there buried, in the yeere 1310. Also
<HI>Ralph Baldocke,</HI> Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> in his
life time gave 200. Markes to the buil∣ding
of the said new worke, and left
much by his Testament towards the fi∣nishing
thereof: hee deceased in the
yeere 1313. and was buried in the La∣dy
Chappell. Also the new worke of
<HI>Pauls,</HI> to wit, the crosse Iles, were begun
to be new builded in the yeere 1256.</P>
<P>The first of February,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pauls</HI> stee∣ple fired by Light∣ning.</NOTE> in the yeere
1444. about two of the clocke in the af∣ternoone,
the Steeple of <HI>Pauls</HI> was fired
by Lightning, in the midst of the Shaft
or Spire, both on the West side, and on
the South: but by labour of many well
disposed people, the same (to appea∣rance)
quenched with Vineger; so that
all men withdrew themselves to their
houses, praysing God. But between 8.
and 9. of the clocke in the same night,
the fire burst out againe more fervently
than before, and did much hurt to the
Lead and Timber, till by the great la∣bour
of the Maior and people that came
thither, it was throughly quenched.</P>
<P>This Steeple was repaired in the yeer
1462. and the Weather-cocke againe
erected:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pauls</HI> stee∣ple repai∣red.</NOTE> <HI>Robert Godwin</HI> winding it up,
the rope brake, and hee was destroyed
on the Pinacles, and the Cocke was sore
brused. But <HI>Burchwood</HI> (the Kings Plum∣mer)
set it up againe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Weather-cocke of <HI>Pauls</HI> stee∣ple.</NOTE> Since the which
time, needing reparation, it was both
taken down, and set up in the yeer 1553.
At which time it was found to bee of
Copper, gilt over, and the length, from
the bill to the taile, being 4. foote, and
the breadth over the wings 3. foot and a
halfe, it weighed 40. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> the Crosse, from
the Bole, to the Eagle (or Cock) was 15.
foote and 6. inches of assise; the length
thereof, overthwart, was 5. foot and 10.
inches, and the compasse of the Bole
was 9. foot and 1. inch. The inner body
of this Crosse was Oake, the next cover
was Lead, and the outermost was of
Copper, red varnished. The Bole and
Eagle, or Cocke, were of Copper, and
gilt also.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Height of the stee∣ple.</NOTE> The height of the Steeple was
520. foot, whereof the stone-worke was

<P>The Colledge of <HI>Petty Canons</HI> there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Petty Ca∣nons <HI>of</HI> Pauls.</NOTE>
was founded by King <HI>Richard</HI> the se∣cond,
in honour of Queene <HI>Anne</HI> his

of his reigne. Their Hall and
Lands was then given unto them, as ap∣peareth
by the Patent, Master <HI>Robert

<PB N="354" REF="188"/>
In the yeere 1408. the <HI>Petty Canons</HI> then
building their Colledge, the Maior and
Communalty granted them their Wa∣ter-courses,
and other easements.</P>
<P>There was also one great Cloyster,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Cloystry of <HI>Pauls.</HI></NOTE>
on the North side of this Church, invi∣roning
a plot of ground, of old time cal∣led
<HI>Pardon Church-yard;</HI> whereof <HI>Tho∣mas
More,</HI> Deane of <HI>Pauls,</HI> was eyther
the first Builder, or a most especiall Be∣nefactor,
and was buried there.</P>
<P>About this Cloyster, was artificially

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dance of <HI>Pauls.</HI></NOTE> or Dance of Death, commonly
called the <HI>Dance of Pauls;</HI> the like
whereof was painted about S. <HI>Innocents</HI>

Monke of <HI>Bury,</HI> the Picture of
Death leading all estates; at the dis∣pence
of <HI>Ienken Carpenter,</HI> in the reigne
of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth. In this Cloyster
were buried many persons, some of
Worship, and others of Honour: The
Monuments of whom, in number and
curious workmanship, passed all other
that were in that Church.</P>
<P>Over the East Quadrant of this Cloy∣ster,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Library of <HI>Pauls.</HI></NOTE> was a faire Library, builded at the
costs and charges of <HI>Walter Sherington,</HI>
Chancellour of the Duchy of <HI>Lancaster,</HI>
in the reigne of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth: which
hath beene well furnished with faire
written bookes in Vellam; but few of
them now doe remaine there.</P>
<P>In the midst of this <HI>Pardon Church-yard,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chappell in <HI>Pardon Church-yard</HI></NOTE> was also a faire Chappell, first
founded by <HI>Gilbert Becket,</HI> Portgrave,
and principall Magistrate of this City,
in the reigne of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> who was
there buried. <HI>Thomas More,</HI> Deane of
<HI>Pauls,</HI> before named, re-edified or new
builded this Chappell, and founded
three Chaplaines there, in the reigne of
<HI>Henry</HI> the fifth.</P>
<P>In the yeere 1549. on the tenth of
April, the said Chappell, by comman∣dement
of the Duke of <HI>Somerset,</HI> was
begun to bee pulled downe, with the
whole Cloystrie, the Dance of Death,
the Tombes and Monuments: so that
nothing thereof was left, but the bare
Plot of ground, which is since conver∣ted
into a Garden for the Petty Ca∣nons.</P>
<P>There was also a Chappell at the
North doore of <HI>Pauls,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chappell at the North doore of <HI>Pauls.</HI></NOTE> founded by the

down in the reigne of <HI>Edw.</HI> the sixth, &amp;
in place thereof a faire house builded.</P>
<P>There was furthermore a faire Chap∣pell
of the holy Ghost in <HI>Pauls</HI> Church,
on the North side, founded in the yeere
1400. by <HI>Roger Holmes,</HI> Chancelor and
Prebendary of <HI>Pauls,</HI> for <HI>Adam Bery,</HI> Al∣derman

Their common Hall was in <HI>Pauls</HI>
Church-yard on the South side, neere
unto a Carpenters yard. This Colledge
was with others suppressed in the reigne
of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth. Then under the
Quire of <HI>Pauls</HI> is a large Chappell, first
dedicated to the name of IESV,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iesus</HI> chap∣pell.</NOTE> foun∣ded,
or rather confirmed the 37. of <HI>Hen.</HI>
the 6. as appeareth by his Patent therof,
dated at <HI>Crowdowne</HI> to this effect:</P>
<P>Many Liege-men and Christian people,
having begun a Fraternity and Guila to the
honour of the most glorious name of Iesu
Christ our Saviour, in a place called the
Crowds of the Cathedrall Church of <HI>Pauls</HI>
in <HI>London,</HI> which hath continued long
time peaceably, till now of late: whereupon
they have made request, and we have taken
upon us the name and charge of the founda∣tion,
to the laud of Almighty God, the Fa∣ther,
the Son, and the holy Ghost, and especi∣ally
to the honour of Iesu, in whose honour
the Fraternity was begun, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The King ordained <HI>William Say,</HI> then
Deane of <HI>Pauls,</HI> to bee the Rector, and
<HI>Richard Ford</HI> (a Remembrancer in the
Exchequer) and <HI>Henry Bennis</HI> (Clarke of

Brothers &amp; Sisters; they and their suc∣cessors
to have a common seale, licence
to purchase lands or tenements, to the
value of 40. <HI>l.</HI> by the yeere, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This foundation was confirmed by

the first, it was agreed, that <HI>Henry Wal∣leis,</HI>
Maior, and the Citizens, for the
cause of shops by them builded, without
the wall of the Church-yard, should as∣signe
to God, and to the Church of S.
<HI>Paul,</HI> tenne Markes of rent by the yeere
for ever, towards the new building of a
Chappell of the blessed Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI>
and also to assigne five Markes of yeere∣ly
rent to a Chaplaine to celebrate
there.</P>
<P>Moreover, in the yeere 1430. the 8.
of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, licence was granted
to <HI>Ienken Carpenter</HI> (Executor to <HI>Richard
Whitington)</HI> to establish upon the said
Charnell, a Chaplaine, to have eight
Markes by the yeere. Then was also in
this Chappell two Brotherhoods. <HI>Ro∣bert
Barton, Henry Barton,</HI> Maior, and
<HI>Thomas Mirfin,</HI> Maior, all Skinners,
were intombed, with their Images
of Alabaster over them, grated or
cooped about with iron, before the said
Chappell; all which was pulled down
in the yeere 1549. The bones of the
dead, couched up in a Charnell, under
the Chappell, were conveyed from
thence into <HI>Finsbury</HI> field, (by report of
him who paid for the carriage) amoun∣ting
to more than one thousand Cart
loads,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reyne Wolfe.</NOTE> and there laid on a moorish
ground, in short space after raised by
soylage of the Citie upon them, to
beare three Milles. The Chappell and
Charnell were converted into dwelling
houses, ware-houses, and Sheds before
them, for Stationers in place of the
Tombes.</P>
<P>In the East part of this Church-yard
standeth <HI>Pauls</HI> Schoole,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pauls</HI> Schoole.</NOTE> lately new
builded, and endowed in the yeere
1512. by <HI>Iohn Collet,</HI> Doctor of Divini∣ty,
and Deane of <HI>Pauls,</HI> for 153. poore
<PB N="357" REF="189"/>
mens children to be taught free in the
same Schoole, for which he appointed
a Master, a Surmaster or Vsher, and a
Chaplaine, with large stipends for e∣ver,
committing the oversight thereof
to the Masters, Wardens and Assistants
of the Mercers in <HI>London,</HI> because hee
was sonne to <HI>Henry Collet,</HI> Mercer, some∣time
Maior. He left to these Mercers
Lands, to the yeerely value of 120. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> or
better.</P>
<P>Neere unto this Schoole, on the
North side thereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clochier in <HI>Pauls</HI> Church-yard.</NOTE> was (of old time) a
great and high Clochier, or Bell-house,
foure square, builded of stone, and in
the same a most strong frame of timber,
with foure Bels, the greatest that I have
heard; these were called <HI>Iesus</HI> Bels, and
belonged to <HI>Iesus</HI> Chappell, but I know
not by whose gift. The same had a great
spire of timber, covered with Lead,
with the Image of Saint <HI>Paul</HI> on the
top, but was pulled downe by Sir <HI>Miles
Partridge,</HI> Knight, in the reigne of <HI>Hen∣ry</HI>
the eighth. The common speech
then was, that hee did set one hundred
pounds, upon a cast at Dice against it,
and so wonne the said Clochier &amp; Bels
of the King: and then causing the Bels
to be broken as they hung, the rest was
pulled downe. This man was afterward
executed on the Tower hill, for matters
concerning the Duke of <HI>Summerset,</HI> the
fifth of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth.</P>
<P>In place of this Clochier, of old time,
the common Bell of the Citie was used
to be rung,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Common Bell of the City.</NOTE> for the assembly of the Ci∣tizens
to their Folke-motes, as I have
before shewed.</P>
<P>About the middest of this Church-yard,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pulpit-crosse in <HI>Pauls</HI> Church-yard.</NOTE> is a Pulpit-crosse of timber, moun∣ted
upon steps of stone, and covered
with Lead, in which are Sermons prea∣ched
by learned Divines, every Sunday
in the fore-noone. The very antiquity
of which Crosse is to me unknowne.</P>
<P>I read, that in the yeere 1259. King
<HI>Henry</HI> the third commanded a generall
Assembly to be made at this Crosse,
where he in proper person commanded
the Maior, that on the next day follow∣ing,
he should cause to be sworne before
the Aldermen, every Stripling, of 12.
yeeres of age, or upward, to be true to
the King and his heires, Kings of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></P>
<P>Also, in the yeere 1262. the same
King caused to be read at <HI>Pauls</HI> Crosse,
a Bull, obtained from Pope <HI>Vrban</HI> the
fourth, as an absolution for him, and for
all that were sworne to maintaine the
Articles made in Parliament at <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>Also, in the yeere 1299. the Deane
of <HI>Pauls</HI> accursed, at <HI>Pauls</HI> Crosse, all
those which had searched in the Church
of S. <HI>Martin</HI> in the field, for an hoord
of gold, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This Pulpit-crosse was by tempest of
lightning and thunder, defaced. <HI>Thomas
Kempe,</HI> Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> new builded
it, in forme as it now standeth.</P>
<P>In the yeere 1561. the fourth of <HI>Iune,</HI>
betwixt the houres of three and foure
of the clocke in the afternoon,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pauls</HI> stee∣ple and Church newly burne.</NOTE> the great
spire of the steeple of S. <HI>Pauls</HI> Church,
was fired by lightning, which brake
forth (as it seemed) two or three yards
beneath the foot of the Crosse, and from
thence it burnt downeward the spire to
the battlements, stone-worke, and Bels,
so furiously, that within the space of 4▪
houres, the same steeple, with all the
roofes of the Church, were consumed,
to the great sorrow and perpetuall re∣membrance
of the beholders. After this
mischance, the Queenes Majestie dire∣cted
her Letters to the Maior,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Speedy repairing of <HI>Pauls</HI> Church.</NOTE> willing
him to take order for speedy repairing
of the same: And she, of her gracious
disposition, for the furtherance thereof,
did presently give and deliver in gold,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queenes gift.</NOTE>
one thousand Markes; with a warrant
for a thousand Loads of Timber, to be
taken out of her Woods, or else-where.</P>
<P>The Citizens also gave first a great
benevolence, and after that three Fif∣teenes
to be speedily paid.</P>
<P>The Clergie of <HI>England,</HI> within the
Province of <HI>Canturbury,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Benevo∣lence.</NOTE> granted the
fortieth part of the value of their Bene∣fices,
charged with first fruits; the thir∣tieth
part of such as were not so char∣ged;
but the Clergie of <HI>London</HI> Dio∣ces,
granted the thirtieth part of all
that payed first fruits, and the twentieth
part of such as had paid their fruits.</P>
<P>Six Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> and two Pe∣tie
Canons of <HI>Pauls</HI> Church, had charge
to further and oversee the worke, wher∣in
such expedition was used, that with∣in
one Moneth next following the bur∣ning
thereof, the Church was covered
<PB N="358" REF="190"/>
with boords and lead, in manner of a
false roofe against the weather, and be∣fore
the end of the said yeere, all the
said Iles of the Church were framed out
of new timber, covered with lead, and
fully finised.</P>
<P>The same yeere also, the great roofes
of the West and East ends were framed
out of great timber in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> brought
thence to <HI>London</HI> by Sea, and set up,
and covered with lead, the North and
South ends were framed of timber, and
covered with lead, before <HI>April, 1566.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning the Steeple, divers mo∣dels
were devised and made, but little
else was done, through whose default
God knoweth: it was said, that the mo∣ney
appointed for the new building of
the Steeple, was collected.</P>
<P>Monuments in this Church, be these:</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monu∣ments in <HI>Pauls</HI></NOTE> as I read of <HI>Erkenwalde,</HI> Bishop
of <HI>London,</HI> buried in the old Church, a∣bout

body was translated into the new work,
in the yeere 1140. being richly shri∣ned,
above the Quire, behinde the high
Altar.</P>
<P><HI>Sebba,</HI> or <HI>Seba,</HI> King of the East <HI>Sa∣xons,</HI>
was first buried in the old Church,
afterward removed into the new, and
laid in a coffin of stone, or gray Marble,
having this Inscription hanging by it:</P>

of a Chappel on the South side of <HI>Pauls</HI>

confirmed greatly the opinion of those,
which have reported, that (of old time)
there had been a Temple of <HI>Iupiter,</HI> and
that there was daily sacrifice of beasts.</P>
<P>Othersome both wise and learned,
have thought the Buckes head borne
before the Procession of <HI>Pauls,</HI> on Saint
<HI>Pauls</HI> day, to signifie the like. But true
it is, I have read an ancient Deed to
this effect:</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William Baud,</HI> Knight, the third
of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, in the yeere 1274.
on Candlemas day, granted to <HI>Harvy

twenty two Acres of ground or land,

ever) upon the Feast day of the Conver∣sion
of <HI>Paul</HI> in VVinter give unto them

and offer the same at the high Altar,
the same to bee spent amongst the Ca∣nons
residents: the Doe to bee brought
by one man at the houre of Procession,
and thorow the Procession to the high
Altar; and the bringer to have nothing:
the Bucke to be brought by all his mey∣ney
in like manner, and they to have
payd unto them by the Chamberlaine
of the Church twelve pence onely, and
no more to be required.</P>
<P>This Grant hee made, and for per∣formance,
bound the Lands of him and
his heyres to bee distrained on: and if
the Lands should bee evicted, that yet
he and his heires should accomplish the
gift. Witnesses, <HI>Richard Tilbery, Wil∣liam
de Wockendon, Richard de Harlowe,</HI>
Knights, <HI>Peter</HI> of <HI>Stanford, Thomas</HI> of
<HI>Waldon,</HI> and some others.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Walter Baude,</HI> sonne to <HI>William,</HI>
confirmed this gift, in the thirtieth of
the said King; and the witnesses there∣unto,
were <HI>Nicholas de Wockendon, Rich.
de Rokeley, Thomas de Mandevile, Iohn
de Rochford,</HI> Knights, <HI>Richard de Broni∣ford,
William de Markes, William de Ful∣ham,</HI>
and other. Thus much for the
Grant.</P>
<P>Now, what I have heard by report,
and have partly seene, it followeth:</P>
<P>On the Feast day of the Commemo∣ration
of Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> the Bucke being
brought up to the steps of the high Al∣tar
in <HI>Pauls</HI> Church, at the houre of
Procession, the Deane and Chapter be∣ing
apparelled in Coapes and Vest∣ments,
with Garlands of Roses on their
heads, they sent the body of the Bucke
to baking, and had the head fixed on a
Pole, borne before the Crosse in their
Procession, untill they issued out of the
VVest doore; where the Keeper that
brought it, blowed the death of the
Bucke, and then the Horners that
were about the City, presently answe∣red
him in like manner: For the which
paines, they had each man of the Dean
and Chapter, foure pence in mony, and
their Dinner, and the Keeper that
brought it, was allowed, during his a∣bode
there (fore that service) Meate,
Drinke, and Lodging, at the Deane and
Chapters, charges, and five shillings in
money at his going away, together with
a Loafe of bread, having the picture of
Saint <HI>Paul</HI> upon it, &amp;c.</P>
<P>There was belonging to the Church
of Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> for both the dayes, two
speciall sutes of Vestments, the one em∣broidered
with Buckes, the other with
Does, both given by the said <HI>Bauds</HI> (as
I have heard.) Thus much for that
matter.</P>
<P>Now to the residue of the Monu∣ments
which are beneath the staires, in
the sides and body of the Church.</P>

duty of servants, and according to their

<P>This Streete is now called <HI>Pater no∣ster

to carry away all the Hosiers and Tay∣lors,
to come to the Guild-Hall in

and Taylors denied to goe with the
said Sheriffe, affirming and saying,
That they had put in Bonds (before

and to Sir <HI>Thomas Saunders,</HI> Knight,
two of the Queenes Iustices of the
Peace within the said Liberty (being

the Queenes Proclamation. And
thereupon, one <HI>Iohn Bradford,</HI> being
Constable of the same exempted place,

Queenes Verge; caused the foure
Porters of the said <HI>Friers,</HI> to shut all the

Sheriffe commanded the Gates to bee
opened; whereunto the said Consta∣ble

not be opened, before the Iustices plea∣sures

then the Sheriffe of <HI>London</HI> said, That

so washed away in the flowing waters

all good Christian men) is at all times,
and in all ages to be rejected, and not to
be imbraced; but rather to be buried in
the bottome of the earth, never to rise
againe.</P>
<P>In consideration whereof, by these
presents, it is for an infallible truth, to
be holden with all men, which shall
heare or see this present writing: That
<HI>Robert Flower,</HI> Taylor and Hosier, dwel∣ling
within the Precinct and liberties of
the late <HI>Blacke Friers,</HI> neere <HI>Ludgate</HI> in
<HI>London;</HI> was by order and commande∣ment
of the whole Bench or Aldermen,
committed into one of the Compters of
<HI>London,</HI> the 20. day of <HI>May, 1502.</HI> For
that the same <HI>Robert Flower</HI> refused to be
bound (acording to order taken) from
the making of monstrous great Hosen,
according to the Queens gracious Pro∣clamation
in that behalfe: Because the
said <HI>Robert Flower</HI> had (amongst other
persons) put in Bonds before the Hono∣rable
Warden of the Five Ports, and
Sir <HI>Thomas Saunders,</HI> Knight, Justices
within the Liberty of the Queenes
Verge. After which reveiled and
knowne to the Honourable Earle of <HI>A∣rundell,</HI>
Lord Steward of the Queenes
most Honourable Houshold, who cau∣sed
the Knight Marshall to goe to the
said Lord Maior, requiring the delive∣rance
of the said prisoner. The Lord
Maior (being sickly) made answer, that
he knew nothing thereof; but desired
him to speake with Master Recorder:
who made answer, that the said impri∣sonment
was done by the whole Bench
of Aldermen, and he (as one particular
person) could not deliver the prisoner,
untill the next Court day, which could
not be till two dayes after, to the great
charges and hinderance of the said pri∣soner.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Lord Steward sent
for Master <HI>Cholmeley,</HI> he being then Re∣corder
of <HI>London,</HI> and commanded him
to deliver the prisoner; or else he would
imprison the Maior of <HI>London,</HI> and the
said Recorder, and the fattest Alder∣man
in the Citie, which hee could get
within the Verge: And declared, that
the Queenes Liberties and Franchises
should not bee overcome by the Lord
Maior and Bench of Aldermen, so long
as he was Officer: with many other
words against the Citizens, which were
too long to write. Adding further, that
the Maior did not meddle with Saint
<HI>Martins,</HI> being within the Citie, and a
parcel of <HI>Westminster</HI> Deanry; much lesse
should he meddle with the said liberty
of the <HI>Friers,</HI> bounded out by walls and
gates from the City, being in the Coun∣ty
of <HI>Middlesex,</HI> and not within the Ci∣tie.
And so commanded the Recorder
to send home the prisoner into the liber∣ty
presently: which was so done accor∣dingly:
Promising, that if the L. Maior
could declare or shew any good Title,
whereby to breake the Liberty, the
Queenes learned Councell should an∣swer
him and them therein. And then
the Recorder said, he never heard be∣fore
that time, that the Lord Steward
did claime the precinct of the said <HI>Black
Friers,</HI> to be within the liberty of the
Queenes Verge: Out of which Ju∣risdiction
the Citie of <HI>London</HI> is exem∣pted
by the Statute of 32. <HI>Hen. 8. Cap.</HI>
2. Vnder colour of which Statute, the
Maior would bring the said Friers to be
in <HI>London;</HI> which in all the Friers time
was freely exempted.</P>
<P>All the which matter was debated
in the presence of Sir <HI>Thomas Saunders,</HI>
Knight; Master <HI>Robert Hopton,</HI> one of
the Knight Marshals, and Mr. <HI>Bromeley,</HI>
under Steward of the <HI>Marshalsea,</HI> the

the said partie had slaine the man dead.
Which afterward was otherwise found
by a Quest of twelve men, sitting <HI>super

given unto King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, by

<P>RIght Worshipfull; you shal un∣derstand
that I have received
your kinde Letter; according
whereunto,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vicar of <HI>Bromley</HI> dwelt for∣merly in the <HI>Blacke Friers.</HI></NOTE> these are to satisfie your
minde; That I was dwelling in the
<HI>Blacke Friers</HI> foure or five yeeres, and
came thither from <HI>Oxford,</HI> where I had
beene a Student of Divinity. I was al∣so
Curate of the Parish within the
<HI>Blacke Friers,</HI> called Saint <HI>Agnes.</HI> Wee
had within us a Porter, who did shut
all the Gates every night; at nine of the
clocke in the Winter, and at ten of the
clocke in the Summer. No Sheriffe,
Bailiffe or Constable, nor yet the Maior
of <HI>London,</HI> tooke interest there at any
time, nor forreine porters had to doe
within our Priviledge: And the Friers
did pave both within the Turn-gate and
without, unto Saint <HI>Andrews</HI> Church,
downe by the great Garden wall: And
without the Turne-gate there was a
Cage, pulled downe by my time, which
was set up by the Lord Maior of <HI>London.</HI>
The inhabitants within the <HI>Friers</HI> never
watched, neither the Constable of Saint
<HI>Martins</HI> Parish warned any watch
there, neither came within the Gates,
after the houre appointed at any time.
The Sheriffes of <HI>London</HI> had no Felons
goods there, neither did arrest any per∣son

As for Bakers and Brewers that belon∣ged
to the house, they be dead.</P>
<P>There is one <HI>Iames Norrice,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The same man spo∣ken of be∣fore.</NOTE> Curate,

<HEAD>The fatall VESPER, or dis∣mall
EVENSONG, happening
at the Blacke Friers on Sunday in
the afternoone, it being the
26. day of October.
1623.</HEAD>
<P>THere were upon that day, being
dedicated to the service of God,
assembled together in the <HI>Black
Friers</HI> neere the French Embassadours
house in ordinary, above three hundred
persons of sundry Nations, as English,
Scottish, Welch, and Irish, to heare a
Sermon, &amp; after that to celebrate Even∣song,
according to the Rites and Cere∣monies
of the Romish Church. Of
which number it is certainly knowne
and confidently reported, that about
the number of threescore of them, had
that morning both confessed them∣selves,
and received the Sacrament, ac∣cording
to the order of the Romish
Church. Hee that was to supply that
exercise for the present, was Father
<HI>Drury,</HI> a Iesuite by profession, and by
birth a Gentleman, being extracted
<PB N="381" REF="201"/>
out of the house of the Norfolcian <HI>Dru∣ries,</HI>
and sonne unto Doctor <HI>Drury,</HI> late
professor of the Civill Law, and practi∣ser
thereof in the Court of the Arches
here in <HI>London.</HI> Hee was by those of the
Romish religion reputed to bee a man
of great learning, as having studied
many yeeres beyond the Sea, with
much approbation and allowance of
his Superiours. And although he were
opposite in point of faith and beliefe
unto the Religion now professed in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
yet was he held by the generality
of our Nation, both Protestants and
Papists, who knew him, and could
make a true estimate of his vertues
and vices by the outward circumstance
and appearance of his actions, to bee a
man of a good moralllife, and of a plau∣sible
and laudable conversation. So that
in respect of these indowments, there
could nothing have been desired more
by us of the Reformed Church, than
that hee had not beene a Papist, but a
member of our Church, Religion, and
Profession. All the day before, which
was the last that ever his eyes beheld,
he was observed to be wondrous sad and
pensive, contrary unto his wonted hu∣mour
and disposition, hee being a man
of a free, merry and affable conversati∣on,
as though that some spirit of predi∣ction
had foretold him of that fatall
disaster, which was at hand. Thus wee
reade of <HI>Caesar,</HI> that hee was possessed
with a strange and unwonted sadnesse
that morning when hee entred into the
Senate house, where he was stabbed to
death by the Senators. And so was that
Assassine <HI>Cass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> much perplexed and
troubled in minde before that mortall
and bloudy battell of <HI>Pharsalia.</HI> By
meanes of which affection, Father <HI>Dru∣rie</HI>
finding an indisposition in himselfe,
hee would (if with his reputation hee
could) have made a retraction of his
promise, and a demurre of the intended
exercise. But being prest on by divers
of his friends, who told him that the
Audience was great, and their expecta∣tion
farre greater, hee did then againe
resolve to goe forward with the enter∣prise.</P>
<P>The place wherein this Congregati∣on
was assembled, was not the French
Ambassadours Chappell, according as
the first report went currant; for that
was reserved for the use of himselfe and
his family, to celebrate their Even-song
after their owne manner and custome,
but it was a Chamber neere unto the
gate, some three stories high, being
some threescore foot long, and twenty
foot broad, or thereabouts. The wals
were not made of Lome, composed of
Laths and Rafters, and covered over
with Clay and Lime, as some at first
reported: but were of Brick and Stone,
which are held by all Architects to bee
the strongest and the surest building.
But howsoever, a Gentlewoman of a
noble house, and of a quicke and judici∣ous
spirit, who was then present, and
had taken a curious view of the pressing
multitude of the people, which was at
length their owne oppression, and of
the unfitnesse and uncapacity of the
place besides, told him, That shee
thought it would prove an action full
of danger, if he should offer to preach
in that place respectively in respect of
the premises. But he being led on by a
divine and fatall necessity, which blinds
the judgement of the wise men of this
world, he told her that he did meane
as then to preach, and to goe forward
with the greatest expedition he could,
with his intended Sermon. For the ac∣complishment
of which designe, the
Father predicant being clad in those
robes and ornaments which are used by
those of his Order, being a Iesuit, ha∣ving
a Surplice girt about his middle
with a linnen girdle, a red Cap with a
white one underneath, turned up about
the brimmes of his Cap, and his other
accoutrements belonging, which the
Ignatian Orders have imposed upon
them: and being placed in a Chaire a∣bout
the middest of the roome, which
Chaire was raised up something higher
than the ordinary levell of the floore:
hee crossing himselfe with the signe of
the Crosse, and having ended some pri∣vate
prayers, accommodated himselfe
to his Text, between three and foure of
the clocke in the afternoone of the fore∣said
Sunday. The words of the Text
were part of the Gospel appointed for
the present day, according to the order
and instruction of the Church of Rome,
being their fifth of November, which
<PB N="382" REF="202"/>
account is thought to bee the truest by
the Romane Catholikes, and begins
ten dayes before that of <HI>England.</HI> The
Gospel was written in the eighteenth
Chapter of St. <HI>Matthewes</HI> Gospel, and
delivered unto us by the holy Spirit, in
these words: <HI>Therefore is the Kingdome
of Heaven likened unto a certaine man that
was a King, which would take account of
his servants. And when hee had begun to
reckon, one was brought unto him which
ought him ten thousand Talents. But for∣asmuch
as hee was not able to pay, his Lord
commanded him to be sold, and his wife and
children, and all that he had, and payment
to be made. The servant fell downe and be∣sought
him, saying: Sir, have patience with
mee and I will pay thee all. Then had the
Lord pity of that servant, and loosed him,
and forgave him the debt. So the same ser∣vant
went out, and found one of his fel∣lowes
which ought him an hundred pence:
And he laid hands on him, and tooke him
by the throat, saying: Pay that thou owest.
And his fellow fell downe and besought him,
saying: Have patience with mee and I will
pay thee all. And he would not, but he went
out and cast him into prison, till hee should
pay the debt. So when his fellowes went
and saw what was done, they were very
sorry, and came and told their Master all
that happened. Then his Lord called him
and sayd unto him: O thou ungracious ser∣vant,
I forgave thee all that debt thou desi∣redst
mee, shouldest not thou also have had
compassion on thy fellow, even as I had pity
on thee, &amp;c?</HI></P>
<P>The words which he insisted especi∣ally
upon, were these:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Note that this Text was divided into three partes; whereof the first part trea∣ted of Gods mer∣cie, the se∣cond of mans in∣gratitude, the third of the Re∣medies which man might use for the procuring of Gods mercie, and cure himselfe from this contagi∣cus dis∣ease of his ingrati∣tude. Which first part onely in part he handled.</NOTE> <HI>O thou ungraci∣ous
servant, I forgave thee all the debt thou
oughtest mee, shouldest not thou also have
had compassion on thy fellow, even as I had
pity on thee?</HI> Vpon which subject dis∣coursing
with much vehemency, and
implying out of it the infinite mercy
and goodnesse of God, whereby he doth
not onely give us all that wee have, but
forgives us all our trespasses and offen∣ces,
bee they never so deeply stayned
with the scarlet dye and tincture of our
guiltinesse: which mercifull act of God
is paraboliz'd unto us by a certain man
that was a King, who tooke account of
his servants, and after much intreaty
and submission, forgave one ten thou∣sand
Talents, which he ought him. And
also dilating by way of blame and re∣prehension
of the ungratefull and un∣relenting
heart of man, who doth not
forgive trespasses as God doth forgive
him; but out of his swelling and ma∣lignant
humour, writes benefits in the
sand, and injuries in marble, which un∣charitablenesse
of theirs is intimated in
the Parable by the ungracious servant,
who would not forgive his fellow a
small debt, although his Master had
forgiven him one of a farre greater va∣lue.
Moreover, upon the application
of these words, hee did inveigh with
much bitternesse, as some give out (but
I know not how truly) against the
manners and doctrine of the Prote∣stants.</P>
<P>But having proceeded thus farre, loe
what a sudden and unexpected accident
fell out. The Sermon inclining to∣wards
the middest, and the day decli∣ning
towards an end, it being almost
foure of the clocke in the afternoone,
the multitude and crowde of the assem∣bly
breaking downe with their over∣bearing
weight the beames and side∣timbers
wherewith this roome was sup∣ported,
they fell downe into the next
Chamber, the floore whereof being
broken downe also with the descending
weight of them and the ruines, they fell
at last upon the lowest Chamber of the
edifice, where some of them perished,
some were hurted and maymed, other∣some
were free from all hurt and dan∣ger
except of that which the present
fright and terror did impose upon them,
and those were they especially who fell
not at all, but remained in one angle or
corner of the Chamber, which was free
from falling. Which persons beeing
thought to be betweene twenty and
thirty in number, as I heard by one,
who was one of them, perplexed and
frighted thus as they were, by conside∣ration
of that most fearefull danger,
whereinto they had seene their fellowes
and brethren to fall, who did lift up
their hands for helpe, and beat their
breasts for life, whereof they then were
spectators; and being doubtfull that
they should be Actors with them pre∣sently
in that Scene of their calamity;
the place being weake, tottering and un∣assured,
for this cause feare and necessity
<PB N="383" REF="202"/>
giving motion and strength unto their
armes, they opened with their Knives a
Lome wall, which parted that roome
and a Chamber belonging to the Am∣bassadours
Lodging. By which meanes,
after much difficulty and labour, they
got their passage, and live as yet to glo∣rifie
God for their deliverance.</P>
<P>Presently upon the report of the fall
and cry, divers persons of all sorts re∣sorted
unto the place, some out of cha∣rity,
to helpe those that were thus di∣stressed;
for which cause they brought
Spades, Pickaxes, and other instru∣ments
fit for that purpose; others out of
meere curiosity came thither, to see this
wonderfull event, and this object so full
of admiration. Where, after the guards
were set upon all the Advenues and pas∣sages
leading into the <HI>Blacke Friers,</HI> and
from thence into the Ambassadours
house, by the direction and command of
Sergeant <HI>Finch,</HI> Recorder of the Citie,
who was exceeding carefull that my
Lord Ambassadour and his servants
should not suffer any detriment in their
goods or persons, being jealous in this
point of the Kings, his owne, and the Ci∣ties
honour: and matters being thus dis∣posed
for the safety and assurance of the
strangers, after they had broken downe
a wall, and opened some doores, they
fell to worke upon the ruines it selfe,
with all possible diligence and dexte∣rity:
where at the opening of every
boord, planke, and peece of Timber,
there were objects which presented
themselves full of horrour and confu∣sion.</P>
<P>Here you might have seene a man
shaking of his legges, and striving for
life: There you might have seene ano∣ther,
putting forth his bloudy hands, and
crying for helpe: Here you might have
seene one like some spectre, thrusting
out his head out of the grave: There
you might have seene his fellow halfe
dead and halfe living, intomb'd in that
grave which he was not long to keepe.
Here you might have seene the living
thus pressed, as they were mourning for
the dead; and there the dead senselesse,
as they were imbracing of the living. So
that since the <HI>Sicilian Vespers,</HI> there was
never an Evensong more dolorous vnto
the <HI>French,</HI> nor more lamentable unto
the <HI>Scots</HI> and <HI>English.</HI> The Count of <HI>Til∣lier,</HI>
who was Ambassadour here in or∣dinary
for the most Christian King,
which place hee hath executed with
great dignity and authority for many
yeeres together, to the generall liking
and applause of both Nations, although
he was fortunate in this, that not one of
his retinue perished, was much agree∣ved
with this unluckie accident, with
whom the <HI>Spanish</HI> Delegates did con∣dole,
as by mutuall reference feeling that
griefe, which fellow-feeling had made
their owne.</P>
<P>Moreover, it was reported by one who
had good intelligence in <HI>Elie</HI> house, that
<HI>Don Carlos Colom's</HI> Steward should say,
that his Master would not for a million
of gold, this accident should have falne
out in his or <HI>Exeter</HI> house. A report
like enough to be beleeved of those, who
know how strangely zealous this Nati∣on
is in their Religion, and how jealous
they are besides of their owne, their
Kings, and of their Countries honour.</P>
<P>Neither were the sorrows meaner a∣mongst
the naturals of this Kingdome,
and the inhabitants of the Citie of <HI>Lon∣don.</HI>
So that here some men lost their
wives, women their husbands, parents
their children, children their parents,
masters their servants, and one friend la∣mented
the losse of another. So that
<HI>Rachel</HI> was weeping for her children
because they were not. <HI>Iob</HI> was lamen∣ting
for his sonnes and daughters, be∣cause
they were slaine together by the
downefall of an house, whilest they were
eating of their last banquet. Insomuch
that the streets did eccho with their do∣lorous
moanes, the wals and houses did
resound with their cries and lamentati∣ons.
The subsequent night was so full
of horrour unto many, that it may bee
truely said of it, as was said of another
dismall night in the like kind:
<Q><L>Quis cladem illius noct is,</L>
<L>quis funera fando</L>
<L>Explicit? aut potis est</L>
<L>lachrymis aequare dolorem?</L></Q></P>
<P>When the bodies were drawn forth
of those heapes of earth and timber,
which taske of charity they were accom∣plishing
<PB N="384" REF="203"/>
all that night, and part of the
next day following, they were found to
be 95. persons, or therabout, of divers cō∣ditions,
besides those who were bruised,
maim'd or wounded. Amongst whom
were divers persons of worth and quali∣tie:
as Father <HI>Drurie,</HI> who was the
Preacher; Father <HI>Redyate,</HI> in whose lod∣ging
this calamity befell; the Lady <HI>Web,</HI>
descended of the Family of the <HI>Treshams,</HI>
and sister unto my La. <HI>Morley,</HI> &amp; my La.
<HI>Sturton,</HI> and many moe besides of that
weaker sexe, who then and there were
assembled at their accustomed devoti∣ons.
Yet were there many who were in
that unfortunate downefall, which esca∣ped
the danger strangely and wonder∣fully.
Amongst whom was Mistris <HI>Lu∣cie
Penruddocke,</HI> extracted from a wor∣thy
and Noble Family, who fell be∣tweene
the Lady <HI>Webbe</HI> and her owne
maid-servant, both of which perished,
yet she was preserved alive, by meanes
of a Chaire which fell hollow upon her,
and sheltered her from further danger.
So was yong Mistris <HI>Webbe,</HI> daughter to
my Lady <HI>Webbe,</HI> who fell neere unto her
mother, and <HI>Elenor Sanders,</HI> who was
covered, with many others, whose lives
were saved within the heapes of these
blood-guilty ruines.</P>
<P>There was also a Minister, whose
name I cannot learne, and therefore al∣though
he survives this misfortune, it
must be buried as yet in silence, who be∣ing
present at the Sermon, as being in∣vited
by some <HI>Romish</HI> Catholike to that
exercise; who also gave him the con∣duct
unto the place; hee fell with the
rest of the multitude assembled there to∣gether;
and being covered with the
rubbish, boords, and other timbers,
which fell upon him from the higher
roomes, and prest with the weight of
divers persons besides, whereof some
were dead, and some were living: be∣ing
in this agonie, which his present
paine, and the feare of death, in his own
judgement even hanging over his head,
did impose (and that not without just
cause) upon him; being (I say) thus di∣stressed,
and striving under those heaps
&amp; ruines for life, the hope whereof, in re∣spect
of the premised impediments, had
almost forsaken him; one of the French
Ambassadours Gentlemen, hearing the
noise and report of this great and dismal
fall, suddenly (as hee could) opened a
doore, which gave entrance into that
chamber, upon the floore whereof, the
heapes and ruines, together with the
oppressed multitude, as then lay. Who
perceiving light by the doore then o∣pened,
the place before being covered
over with darknesse, he strove with all
the strength and agilicy he could, which
in him was not meane, he being a man
of a very strong and able body, and at
last, after the losse of his cloke and ren∣ting
of his clothes, hee recovered him∣selfe,
without any further hurt. Which
the Gentleman perceiving, came and
demanded of him, whether or no hee
were hurt, or that he stood in need of a∣ny
thing that might doe him service, or
procure him comfort. But he being al∣most
exanimated and astonisht, could
not at first apprehend those courteous
proffers which were tendred unto him
by this stranger, who presently went
and brought him into a Chamber;
where after he had sate a while, and re∣freshed
himselfe with wine, which was
brought unto him; and having thus re∣covered
his strength and spirits, hee re∣turned
to the foresaid place againe, and
used his best endevours for the releeving
of others from that calamity, whereof
but even now he was a fellow-sufferer.
His man who attended on him, was re∣covered
amongst the rest, hee being
something bruised and hurt in the
arme.</P>
<P>Moreover, there was a yong girle,
about the age of ten yeeres, as is suppo∣sed,
(when this Minister, out of his cha∣ritable
and commiserating disposition,
was labouring for the safety and preser∣vation
of them, whose necessities did
then require it) came crying unto him,
and said, O my Mother, O my Sister,
which are downe under the timber and
rubbish. But he wisht her to be patient
for a time, and by Gods grace they
should get forth quickly. Vpon which
speech the child replyed presently, that
howsoever this accident would prove a
great scandall to their Religion. A
speech which is worth admiration in all
men, as this Relator did truely admire
it, that a childe of so tender yeeres,
wherein amongst the most towardliest,
<PB N="385" REF="203"/>
there is scarce ability to discerne be∣tweene
good and evill, should next un∣to
that griefe, which the danger of her
mother and sister did inflict upon her,
lament for nothing more than for the
scandall which their cause was like to
suffer by the disaster.</P>
<P>It was reported also that many more
were drawne out alive the next mor∣ning:
but I will not stand too much
upon the justification of this report, lest
I should seeme to bee too credulous of
those things, which are contrary to the
rules of reason and nature.</P>
<P>The day following, which was Mun∣day,
and the Eve of <HI>Simon</HI> and <HI>Iude,</HI>
there was great care had for viewing
the place, and for buriall of the dead.
For this cause the Recorder and She∣riffes,
about one of the clocke in the af∣ternoone,
met at the <HI>French</HI> Ambassa∣dors
house, having first shut up <HI>Ludgate,</HI>
to prevent the throng and resort of the
people, which was exceeding great and
turbulent in those places: and then ha∣ving
doubled their guards upon every
Port and passage, and given expresse
charge unto the warders, upon paine of
their displeasure and punishment, that
no man should enter in without theirs,
or the Coroners Warrant, they fell at
length to consult about the businesse,
and after mature consideration, conclu∣ded,
that this dolefull accident fell out,
not by any indirect practise or conspi∣racie
(as was by some maliciously repor∣ted)
but that those fourescore and odde
persons fell by meanes of their owne
weight, and the weaknesse of those tim∣bers
which did support the Chamber.</P>
<P>The Iurie having thus brought in their
verdict, they disposed presently for the
buriall of the dead, some of whom were
carried by their friends unto Churches,
farre remote, there to receive their due
obsequies; others were buried in the
same place, &amp; those were of the meanest
ranke, whereof some twenty, or therea∣bout,
were laid in one Sepulcher, having
a common grave, as they had a common
death and downefall. The conjectures
concerning this event were divers: For
some gave out, that it was the just pu∣nishment
and vengeance of God infli∣cted
upon thē for their Idolatry. More∣over,
there were divers doubting spirits
amongst the <HI>Romane</HI> Catholikes, who
thought that this was some conspiracie
of the Protestants. But if the building
had beene demolished and overthrown
by their indirect &amp; treacherous means,
it must have been done either by blow∣ing
it up with Gunpowder, by sapping
away the earth from the foundation,
by undermining it, or by cutting off,
or taking away those supporters and pil∣lars,
upon whom the frame and ma∣chine
of the building was grounded. All
which were found to bee false, upon
most diligent search and inquirie made
in that behalfe. But that which carried
apparent appearance of truth, and that
which the Protestants and Papists did
allow, who were of the more milder,
temperate, and sounder judgement, was
thus: That this disaster hapned not by
means of any divine miracle, or humane
malice; but by the defect and weaknes
of the place, into which such a multi∣tude
were crowded and assembled to∣gether,
the judgement of God concur∣ring
therewithall.</P>
<P>The Society of the Jesuites did suffer
much, in losing the persons of Father
<HI>Drurie</HI> and Father <HI>Redyate.</HI> And divers
persons of both Religions, but especial∣ly
the Priests, who are men of as great
care and vigilancie, but of a farre grea∣ter
moderation, did taxe and blame
them, for that they brought their flocke
into a place of no greater safety or assu∣rance;
and besides, because their conven∣ticle
and meeting was so publike, there
being divers Protestants assembled at
it, some of whom were reported to have
a share in this calamity, and the times
as yet not serving for such assemblies,
the Kings pardon being not yet publish∣ed,
which was granted, as they say to all
the <HI>Romane</HI> Catholikes of these King∣domes.
But whatsoever thou be, Prote∣stant
or Papist, that doth see this mourn∣full
object, judge not, lest thou bee jud∣ged.
Neither thinke thou, that those 18.
men, upon whom the Tower of <HI>Silom</HI>
fell, or those persons whose blood <HI>Pilate</HI>
mingled with their sacrifice, were more
grievous sinners than all the rest of the
children of <HI>Israel;</HI> or that these who pe∣rished
thus together, were more noto∣rious
offenders than all the rest of their
brethren and Religion: for assure thy
<PB N="386" REF="204"/>
selfe, that except thou repent, thou al∣so
shalt perish. And this repentance of
thine must not be <HI>propter scandalum mun∣di,</HI>
for the scandall and offence of the
world, for so did <HI>Saul</HI> repent, when out
of a foolish and State-spoiling pitie, he
had spared <HI>Agag</HI> the cursed Tirant of
<HI>Amalecke;</HI> and but of a faire yet foule
pretence, had spared the fairest of the
Cattell for sacrifice: for being rebuked
by the Prophet <HI>Samuel,</HI> he doth repent,
and desires him to honour him in the
sight of the Elders, and to turne unto
him, and he would turne unto the Lord
his God. Neither must it be <HI>propter poe∣nam
peccati,</HI> for their punishment, that is
due unto sinne; for so did <HI>Ahab</HI> repent,
when hee was reprooved by <HI>Elias</HI> for
killing of <HI>Naboth,</HI> and detaining of his
Vineyard, he rent his clothes, and gir∣ded
himselfe in sack-cloath, as the Text
hath it: But after that the fright and
terrour of Gods must terrible sentence
was worne out of his minde, and the
custome of sinne began to prevaile a∣gaine,
he sold himselfe to commit such
abominations, the like whereof were
never committed in <HI>Israel.</HI> But our re∣pentance
must be <HI>propter reatum peccati,</HI>
for the guilt of sinne, as sinne is a breach
of the Law, and a transgression of Gods
Commandement. <HI>Quae sic dolet com∣missa,
ut non doleat committenda:</HI> Which
repentance doth grieve for sinnes com∣mitted,
as though it meant to commit
no more; and mourne for offences past,
as though it did meane to passe over no
more.</P>
<P>We must take Repentance as <HI>Iob</HI> did,
in dust and ashes. Being dust, we must
take it in dust; and being ashes, we must
take it in ashes. Our transgressions in
this Kingdome and in this Citie have
beene most grievous, therefore our con∣trition
should bee eminent and exem∣plar.
Our pride hath made us, with <HI>Lu∣cifer,</HI>
to <HI>superbire &amp; superire,</HI> to looke o∣ver
our selves, not into our selves, and
to esteeme our selves like unto God,
when we are scarce men.</P>
<P>Neither is this pride <HI>simplex peccatum,</HI>
a single and simple sinne, but it drawes
after it excesse and riot, as it were, with
a cart-rope: unto which luxurie of ours,
neither <HI>Persian</HI> nor <HI>Romane</HI> were equall.
After which follow fornications and
adulteries, which are so frequent in
this place, that in vaine may we speake
of the Bordellas of <HI>Rome,</HI> or the Stewes
of <HI>Venice,</HI> since the Suburbs of this sin∣full
Citie, are as bad as the Suburraes
of <HI>Rome</HI> or <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, our drunkennesse is such,
that although our eyes looke red, and
our hearts are as fat as brawn with drin∣king
of Wine, yet, we rise up early to
drinke strong drinke: which when it
hath inflamed our blood and spirits, we
are ready, with <HI>Lot,</HI> to fall into all pol∣lution
and uncleannesse.</P>
<P>And last of all, wee are so uncharita∣ble,
so stony-hearted and close-fisted,
that wee may bee fitly compared unto
lumps of clay, tempered with blood,
although we are statues of flint, with∣out
the blood or life of charity.</P>
<P>For this cause, repent, <HI>ô England,</HI> re∣pent,
ô <HI>London;</HI> repent Protestants, re∣pent
Papists, for your transgressions and
offences: repent, repent; for by these
wonderfull signes and tokens, it doth
appeare most cleerely, that the King∣dome
of Heaven is at hand.</P>

to sell no bread in their shops or houses,
but in the Market; and that they

remaine yet in the ground undigged. It

<P>Out of this <HI>Breadstreet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Basing lane <HI>called the</HI> Bakehouse.</NOTE> on the same

afore shewed) is of this VVard, but
how it tooke the name of <HI>Basing</HI> I have
not read. In the twentieth yeere of <HI>Ri∣chard</HI>
the second, the same was called
the <HI>Bakehouse,</HI> whether meant for the
Kings Bakehouse, or of Bakers dwel∣ling
there, and baking Bread to serve
the Market in <HI>Breadstreet,</HI> where the
Bread was sold, I know not: but sure I
am, I have not read of <HI>Basing,</HI> or of <HI>Ger∣rard</HI>
the Gyant, to have any thing there
to doe.</P>
<P>On the South side of this Lane is one
great house, of old time builded upon
arched Vaults, and with arched Gates
of stone brought from <HI>Cane</HI> in <HI>Norman∣die.</HI>
The same is now a common Ostrey
for receit of Travellers, commonly and
corruptly called <HI>Gerards Hall,</HI> of a Gy∣ant
said to have dwelled there. In the
high rooffed Hall of this house some∣time
stood a large Firre-Pole,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Pole of 40. foot long and 15. inches about, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣buled to be the ju∣sting staffe of <HI>Gerard</HI> a Gyant.</NOTE> which
reached to the roofe thereof, and was
said to be one of the staves that <HI>Gerard</HI>
the Gyant used in the warres to runne
withall. There stood also a Ladder of
the same length, which (as they said)
served to ascend to the top of the staffe.
Of later yeers this Hall is altred in buil∣ding,
and divers roomes are made in it.
Notwithstanding, the Pole is removed
to one corner of the Hall, and the Lad∣der
hanged broken, upon a wall in the
yard. The Hosteler of that house said
to mee, the Pole lacked halfe a foote of
forty in length. I measured the com∣passe
thereof, and found it fifteene in∣ches.
Reason of the Pole could the Ma∣ster
of the Hostery give me none, but
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade mee reade the great Chronicles;
for there he heard of it. Which answer
<PB N="394" REF="208"/>
seemed to me insufficient: for he meant
the description of Britaine, for the most
part drawne out of <HI>Iohn Leyland</HI> his
Commentaries, (borrowed of my selfe)
and placed before <HI>Reyne Wolfes</HI> Chroni∣cle,
as the labours of another (who was
forced to confesse, that he never travel∣led
further than from <HI>London</HI> to the
Vniversity of <HI>Oxford)</HI> hee writing a
Chapter of Gyants or monstrous men,
hath set down more matter than troth,
as partly (against my will) I am enfor∣ced
here to touch. <HI>R. G.</HI> in his briefe
Collection of Histories (as he termeth
it) hath these words:</P>
<P>I the writer hereof, did see the tenth day
of March, in the yeere of our Lord, 1504.
and had the same in my hand, the tooth of a
man, which weighed ten ounces of Troy
weight: and the scull of the same man is ex∣tant
and to bee seene, which will hold five
peckes of wheate; and the shin-bone of the
same man, is sixe foote in length, and of a
marvellous greatnesse: <HI>this saw</HI> R. G.</P>
<P>The errour thereof is thus:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>R. G.</HI> saw a stone, and said the same to be a tooth, but being by my self proved a stone, there fai∣led both scull and shank∣bone, and followed a cluster of lies toge∣ther, yet since in∣creased by other.</NOTE> he affir∣meth
a stone to be the tooth of a man,
which stone (so proved) having no
shape of a tooth, had neither scull nor
shin-bone. Notwithstanding, it is ad∣ded
in the said description, that by con∣jecturall
symetry of those parts, the
body to be twenty and eight foote long
or more. From this he goeth to another
like matter, of a man with a mouth six∣teene
foote wide, and so to <HI>Gerard</HI> the
Gyant, and his staffe. But to leave these
fables, and returne where I left, I will
note what my selfe hath observed con∣cerning
that house.</P>
<P>I reade, that <HI>Iohn Gisors,</HI> Maior of
<HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gerards Hall</HI> re∣stored to his old name.</NOTE> in the yeere 1245. was owner
thereof, and that Sir <HI>Iohn Gisors,</HI> Knight,
Maior of <HI>London,</HI> and Constable of the
Tower 1311. and divers others of that
name and family, since that time owed
it. <HI>William Gisors</HI> was one of the She∣riffes,
1329. More, <HI>Iohn Gisors</HI> had is∣sue,
<HI>Henry</HI> and <HI>Iohn:</HI> which <HI>Iohn</HI> had is∣sue,
<HI>Thomas:</HI> Which <HI>Thomas</HI> deceasing
in the yeere 1350. left unto his sonne
<HI>Thomas</HI> his messuage,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gerards Hall</HI> over∣throwne with <HI>Ge∣rard</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> great Speare.</NOTE> called <HI>Gisors Hall,</HI>
in the Parish of Saint <HI>Mildred</HI> in <HI>Bread∣street:
Iohn Gisors</HI> made a Feoffment
thereof 1386. &amp;c. So it appeareth, that
this <HI>Gisors Hall</HI> of late time (by corrup∣tion,
hath been called <HI>Gerards Hall,</HI> for
<HI>Gisors Hall,</HI> as <HI>Bosomes Inne,</HI> for <HI>Blossoms
Iune, Bevis Markes,</HI> for <HI>Buries Markes,
Marke lane,</HI> for <HI>Mart lane, Billiter lane,</HI>
for <HI>Belzetters lane, Gutter lane,</HI> for <HI>Gu∣thuruns
lane, Cry Church,</HI> for <HI>Christs
Church,</HI> Saint <HI>Michael</HI> in the <HI>Querne,</HI>
for Saint <HI>Mihel</HI> at <HI>Corne,</HI> and such o∣thers.
Out of this <HI>Gisors Hall,</HI> at the first
building thereof, were made divers ar∣ched
doores yet to be seen, which seem
not sufficient for any great Monster, or
other than men of common stature to
passe thorow. The Pole in the Hall
might bee used of old time (as then the
custome was in every Parish) to bee set
up in the Summer a May-Pole, before
the principall house in the Parish or
Streete,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Every mans house of old time was dec∣ked with Holly and Ivie in the Winter, e∣specially at Christ∣mas.</NOTE> and to stand in the Hall before
the Scrine, decked with Holme and
Ivie, at the Feast of Christmas. The
Ladder served for the decking of the
May-Pole, and Roofe of the Hall. Thus
much for <HI>Gisors Hall,</HI> and for that side
of <HI>Breadstreet</HI> may suffice.</P>
<P>Now on the West side of <HI>Breadstreet,</HI>
amongst divers faire and large houses
for Merchants, and faire Innes for pas∣sengers,
had yee one Prison-house, per∣taining
to the Sheriffes of <HI>London,</HI> cal∣led
the Compter in <HI>Breadstreet:</HI> but in
the yeere 1555. the Prisoners were re∣moved
from thence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Compter in <HI>Bread∣street.</HI></NOTE> to one other new
Compter in <HI>Woodstreet,</HI> provided by the
Cities purchase, and builded for that
purpose: the cause of which remove
was this: <HI>Richard Husband,</HI> Pastelar,
keeper of this Compter in <HI>Breadstreete,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prisoners removed from the Compter in <HI>Bread∣street</HI> to a new Cop∣ter in <HI>Woodstreet▪</HI> Keeper of the Compter sent to Newgate.</NOTE>
being a wilfull and head-strong man,
dealt (for his owne advantage) hard
with the prisoners under his change, ha∣ving
also servants, such as himselfe li∣ked
best for their bad usage, and would
not for any complaint bee reformed:
whereupon, in the yeere 1550. Sir <HI>Row∣land
Hill</HI> being Maior, by the assent of a
Court of Aldermen, he was sent to the
Goale of <HI>Newgate,</HI> for the cruell hand∣ling
of his prisoners: and it was com∣manded
to the Keeper, to set those I∣rons
on his legges, which are called the
Widowes almes. These he ware from
Thursday, till Sunday in the afternoon,
and being by a Court of Aldermen re∣leased
on the Tuesday, was bound in an
hundred Markes, to observe from
thenceforth an Act made by the Com∣mon

hee continued as afore,

a Sessions of Goale delivery, in the

be safe from searches that were made
abroad:<NOTE PLACE="marg">They in∣dighted the Bow∣ling-Al∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies, &amp;c.</NOTE> for the which enormities, and
other not needfull to be recited, hee was
indighted at that Session, but did rubbe
it out, and could not bee reformed, till
this remove of the prisoners: for the

lease, or otherwise, so that he could not
be put from it. Note that Iaylors, buy∣ing

the yeere 1546. on the thirteenth of

of the said King to the Citizens, for re∣lieving
of the Poore, which contained
the Church of the <HI>Gray Friers,</HI> the

<P>Then also were Orders devised for
<PB N="418" REF="220"/>
reliefe of the Poore: the inhabitants
were all called to their Parish Chur∣ches;
where, by Sir <HI>Richard Dobbes,</HI>
then Maior, their severall Aldermen,
or other grave Citizens, they were by
eloquent Orations perswaded, how
great and how many commodities
would ensue unto them and their City,
if the poore of divers sorts, which they
named, were taken from out their
Streets, Lanes, and Allies, and were
bestowed and provided for in Hospi∣tals
abroad, &amp;c. Therefore was every
man moved, liberally to grant (what
they would impart) towards the prepa∣ring
and furnishing of such Hospitals,
and also, what they would contribute
weekly towards their maintenance for a
time, which (they said) should not bee
past one yeere, or twaine, untill they
were better furnished of Endowment.
To make short, every man granted li∣berally,
according to his ability: Books
were drawne of the Reliefe in every
VVard of the City, towards the new
Hospitals, and were delivered by the
Maior to the Kings Commissioners, on
the seventeenth of February; and order
was taken therein, so as the sixe and
twentieth of Iuly, in the yeere 1552.
the repairing of the <HI>Gray Friers</HI> house,
for poore fatherlesse children, was ta∣ken
in hand; and also, in the later end
of the same moneth, began the repai∣ring
of this Hospitall of Saint <HI>Bartholo∣mew,</HI>

at the charges of the Citizens.</P>

to be voided out of the City. He placed
Canons there; himselfe became their
first Prior, &amp; so continued till his dying
day, and was there buried in a faire Mo∣nument,
of late renewed by Prior <HI>Bolton.</HI></P>
<P>Amongst other memorable matters
touching this Priory, one is of an Arch∣bishops
Visitation, which <HI>Matthew
Paris</HI> hath thus:</P>
<P><HI>Boniface (saith hee)</HI> Archbishop of
<HI>Canturbury,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Archbi∣shop of <HI>Canturbury</HI> visiteth S. <HI>Bartholo∣mews</HI> Pri∣ory with stripes.</NOTE> in his Visitation came to this
Priory; where, being received with Proces∣sion
in the most solemne wise, he said, That
hee passed not upon the honour, but came to
visit them; to whom the Canons answered,
That they having a learned Bishop, ought
not, in contempt of him, to be visited by any
other: which answer so much offended the
Archbishop, that hee forthwith fell on the
Sub-Prior, and smote him on the face, say∣ing;
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Words of the Arch∣bishop to the Prior and Ca∣nons.</NOTE> Indeed, indeed, doth it became you
English Traytors so to answer mee? Thus
raging, with oathes not to bee recited, hee
rent in peeces the rich Cope of the Sub-Pri∣or,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sub-Pri∣ors Cope rent and trodden under foot, and himselfe almost slaine.</NOTE> and trode it under his feete, and thrust
him against a Pillar of the Chancell with
such violence, that hee had almost killed
him. But the Canons seeing their Sub-Prior
thus almost slaine, came and plucked
off the Archbishop with such force, that
they overthrew him backwards; whereby
they might see,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arch∣bishop ar∣med, and ouer∣throwne.</NOTE> that he was armed, and pre∣pared
to fight. The Archbishops men seeing
their Master downe, being all strangers, and
their Masters Countrimen borne at <HI>Pro∣vince,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ca∣nons bea∣ten and trod un∣der foot.</NOTE> fell upon the Canons, beat them,
tare them, and trode them under foot. At
length, the Canons getting away as well as
they could, ran bloudy, miry, rent and torne
to the Bishop of <HI>London</HI> to complaine, who
bade them goe to the King at <HI>Westmin∣ster,</HI>
and tell him thereof: whereupon foure
of them went thither,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ca∣nons com∣plained but could not bee heard.</NOTE> the rest were not able,
they were so sore hurt. But when they came
to <HI>Westminster,</HI> the King would neither
heare nor see them; so they returned with∣out
redresse.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The whole City is an uproare a∣gainst the Archbi∣shop.</NOTE> In the meane season the City
was in an uproare, and ready to have rung
the common Bell, and to have hewed the
Archbishop into small peeces, who was se∣cretly
crept to <HI>Lambhith,</HI> where they
sought him, and not knowing him by sight,
said to themselves; where is this Ruffian,
that cruell smiter? Hee is no winner of
soules, but an exactor of money, whom nei∣ther
God, nor any lawfull or free election
did bring to this promotion: but the King
did unlawfully intrude him, being unlear∣ned,
a stranger borne, and having a wife,
&amp;c. But the Archbishop conveighed him∣selfe
over, and went to the King with a great
<PB N="419" REF="220"/>
complaint against the Canons, whereas him∣selfe
was guilty. <HI>This Priory of Saint</HI>
Bartholomew <HI>was againe new builded in
the yeere 1410.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bolton</HI> was the last Prior of this house,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bolton</HI> last Prior of Saint <HI>Bar∣tholomew</HI> a great buil∣der there.</NOTE>
a great builder there: for hee repaired
the Priory Church, with the Parish
Church adjoyning, the offices and
lodgings to the said Priory belonging
and neere adjoyning:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Canon∣bury.</NOTE> he builded of new
the Mannor of <HI>Canonbury</HI> at <HI>Islington,</HI>
which belonged to the Canons of this
house, and is situate in a low ground,
somewhat North from the Parish
Church there. But he builded no house
at <HI>Harrow</HI> on the hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Edward Hall.</NOTE> as <HI>Edward Hall</HI>
hath written, following a fable then on
foote.</P>
<P>The people <HI>(saith hee)</HI> being feared by
Prognostications, which declared that in
the yeere of Christ, 1524. there should bee
such Ecli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses in watry signes, and such con∣junctions,
that by waters and flouds many
people should perish: people victualled
themselues, and went to high grounds for
feare of drowning, and especially one <HI>Bol∣ton,</HI>
which was Prior of Saint <HI>Bartholo∣mewes</HI>
in Smithfield, builded him an house
upon Harrow on the hill, onely for feare of
this floud: thither he went and made provi∣sion
of all things necessary within him, for
the space of two moneths, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But this was not so indeed, as I have
been credibly informed: true it is, that
this <HI>Bolton</HI> was also Parson of <HI>Harrow,</HI>
and therefore bestowed some small re∣parations
on the Parsonage house, and
builded nothing there more than a
Dovehouse, to serve him when hee had
forgone his Priory.</P>
<P>To this Priory King <HI>Henry</HI> the se∣cond
granted the priviledge of a Faire
to bee kept yeerly at <HI>Bartholomewtide,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bartholo∣mew Faire.</NOTE> for three daies, to wit, the Eve, the

their Boothes and standings within the

with VVals and Gates locked every
night, and watched for safety of mens
goods and wares; a Court of Piepow∣ders
was daily during the Faire holden,
for debts and contracts.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Court of Piepow∣ders.</NOTE> But notwith∣standing
all Proclamations of the

in place of Booths within this Church-yard
(only letten out in the Faire time,

30. of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, was valued at
653. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 15. <HI>s.</HI> by the yeere.</P>
<P>This Church having in the Bell-Tower
sixe bels in a tune, those bels
were sold to the Parish of Saint <HI>Sepul∣chres,</HI>
and then the Church being pulled
downe to the Quire, the Quire was by
the Kings order annexed, for the enlar∣ging
of the old Parish Church there to
adjoyning, and so was used till the
reigne of Queene <HI>Mary,</HI> who gave the
remnant of the Priory Church to the
Friers preachers, or <HI>Blacke Friers,</HI> and
was used as their Coventuall Church,
untill the first of our Soveraigne Lady
Queene <HI>Elizabeth:</HI> then those Friers
were put out, and all the said Church,
with the old parish Church, was whol∣ly
as it stood, in the last yeere of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>
the sixth, given by Parliament, to
remaine for ever a parish Church to the
Inhabitants within the Close, called
great Saint <HI>Bartholomewes.</HI> Since the
which time, the old parish Church is
pulled downe, except the Steeple of
rotten Timber, ready to fall of it selfe.
I have oft heard it reported, that a new
Steeple should bee builded with the
Stone, Lead and Timber of the old pa∣rish
Church, but no such thing was
performed. The parish have lately re∣paired
the old woodden Steeple, to
serve their turne. On the North side
of this Priory, is the Lane truly called
<HI>Long,</HI> which reacheth from <HI>Smithfield</HI>
to <HI>Aldersgate street.</HI> This Lane is now
lately builded on both the sides with
Tenements for Brokers, Tiplers, and
such like: the rest of <HI>Smithfield</HI> from
<HI>Long lane</HI> end to the Barres,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Long lane.</NOTE> is inclosed
with Innes, Brew-houses, and large Te∣nements;
on the VVest side is <HI>Chicken
lane,</HI> downe to <HI>Cowbridge.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chicken lane. Cowbridge. <HI>Pens in</HI> Smithfield.</NOTE> Then be the
pens or folds, so called of sheepe there
parted, and penned up to be sold on the

<P>Then is <HI>Smithfield</HI> Pond,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Smithfield</HI> Pond sometime a poole.</NOTE> which of
(old time) in Records was called <HI>Horse-Poole,</HI>
for that men watered Horses
there, and was a great water. In the
sixth of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, a new building
was made in the VVest part of <HI>Smith∣field,</HI>
betwixt the said Poole and the Ri∣ver
of the <HI>Wels,</HI> or <HI>Turnemill-brooke,</HI> in a
place then called the <HI>Elmes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Elms in <HI>Smith∣field</HI> a place wherein trespassers were exe∣cuted.</NOTE> for that
there grew many Elme trees, and this
had been the place of execution for Of∣fenders:
since the which time, the buil∣ding
there hath been so increased, that
now remaineth not one tree growing.</P>
<P>Amongst these new buildings is <HI>Cow∣bridge
street,</HI> or <HI>Cow lane;</HI> which turneth
toward <HI>Oldbourne,</HI> in which Lane the
Prior of <HI>Semperingham</HI> had his Inne, or

<P>And thus much for incroachments

dayes: there bare them well, <HI>Henry</HI> of
<HI>Darby,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Lancasters</HI> sonne, the
Lord <HI>Beaumont,</HI> Sir <HI>Simon Burley,</HI> and
Sir <HI>Paris Countney.</HI></P>
<P>In the 14. of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, after
<HI>Froisard,</HI> royall Iusts and Turnements
were proclaimed to be done in <HI>Smith∣field,</HI>
to begin on Sunday next after the
feast of Saint <HI>Michael;</HI> many strangers
came forth of other countries: namely,
<HI>Valariam,</HI> Earle of S. <HI>Paul,</HI> that had mar∣ried
king <HI>Richards</HI> sister, the Lady <HI>Maud
Courtney,</HI> and <HI>William</HI> the young Earle
of <HI>Ostarvant,</HI> son to <HI>Albret</HI> of <HI>Baviere,</HI>
Earle of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Henault.</HI></P>
<P>At the day appointed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tower Royall.</NOTE> there issued
forth of the Tower, about the third
houre of the day 60. Coursers, appar∣relled
for the Iusts, and upon every one
an Esquire of honour riding a soft pace:
then came forth 60. Ladies of honour
mounted upon Palfraies, riding on the
one side richly apparrelled, and every
Lady led a Knight with a chain of gold,
those Knights being on the Kings party,
had their armour &amp; apparell garnished
with white Harts, and crownes of gold
about the Harts neckes, and so they
came riding through the streets of <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
to <HI>Smithfield,</HI> with a great number
of Trumpets, and other instruments of
Musicke before them. The King and
Queene, who were lodged in the Bi∣shops
Palace of <HI>London,</HI> were come from
thence, with many great Estates, and
placed in chambers to see the Iusts: the
Ladies that led the knights, were taken
downe from their Palfraies, and went
up to chambers prepared for them.
Then alighted the Esquires of Honour
from their Coursers, and the knights in
good order mounted upon them; and
after their Helmets were set on their
heads, and being ready in all points,
Proclamation made by the Heralds, the
Iusts began, and many commendable
courses were runne, to the great plea∣sure
of the beholders: this Iusts conti∣nued
many dayes with great feasting,
as ye may reade in <HI>Froisard.</HI></P>
<P>In the yeere 1393. the 17. of <HI>Richard</HI>
the 2. certaine Lords of <HI>Scotland</HI> came
into <HI>England</HI> to get worship, by force of
Armes, the Earle of <HI>Marre</HI> challenged
the Earle of <HI>Notingham,</HI> to Iust with
him, and so they rode together certaine
courses, but not the full challenge, for
the Earle of <HI>Marre</HI> was cast both horse
and man, and two of his ribbes broken
with the fall, so that he was conveighed
out of <HI>Smithfield,</HI> and so towards <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
but dyed by the way at <HI>Yorke.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Wil. Darell,</HI> knight, the Kings Ban∣ner-bearer
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> challenged Sir
<HI>Percy Courtney,</HI> knight, the Kings Ban∣ner-bearer
of <HI>England,</HI> and when they
had runne certaine courses, gave over
without conclusion of victory. Then
<HI>Cookborne,</HI> Esquire of <HI>Scotland,</HI> challen∣ged
Sir <HI>Nicholas Hawberke,</HI> knight, and
rode five courses, but <HI>Cookborne</HI> was
borne over horse and man, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the yeere 1409. the tenth of <HI>Henry</HI>
the fourth, a great Play was played at
<HI>Skinners Well,</HI> which lasted eight dayes,
where were to see the same, the most
part of the Nobles and Gentles in <HI>Eng∣land:</HI>
and forthwith began a royall Ju∣sting
in <HI>Smithfield,</HI> between the Earle of
<HI>Somerset,</HI> and the <HI>Seneshall</HI> of <HI>Henalt,</HI> Sir
Io. <HI>Cornwall,</HI> Sir <HI>Richard Arundell,</HI> and
the sonne of Sir <HI>Iohn Cheyney,</HI> against
<PB N="422" REF="222"/>
certaine French men. And the same
yeere a battell was fought in <HI>Smithfield,</HI>
between two Esquires, the one called
<HI>Glaucester Appellant,</HI> and the other <HI>Ar∣thure
Defendant,</HI> they fought valiantly,
but the King tooke up the quarrell into
his hands, and pardoned them both.</P>
<P>In the yeere 1430. the eighth of <HI>Hen∣ry</HI>
the sixth, the fourteenth of Ianuary, a
battell was done in <HI>Smithfield,</HI> within
the Lists, before the King, between two
men of <HI>Feversham</HI> in <HI>Kent, Iohn Vpton,</HI>
Notary, <HI>Appellant,</HI> and <HI>Iohn Downe,</HI>
Gentleman, <HI>Defendant: Iohn Vpton</HI> put
upon <HI>Iohn Downe,</HI> that he and his Com∣piers
should imagine the Kings death
upon the day of his Coronation. When
these had fought long, the King took up
the matter, &amp; forgave both the parties.</P>
<P>In the yeere 1442. the 20. of <HI>Henry</HI>
the sixth, the 30. of Ianuary, a Chal∣lenge
was done in <HI>Smithfield,</HI> within the
Lists, before the King, there being Sir
<HI>Philip la Beaufe,</HI> of <HI>Aragon,</HI> Knight, the
other an Esquire of the Kings house,
called <HI>Iohn Ansley,</HI> or <HI>Anstley;</HI> they came
to the field all armed, the Knight with
his sword drawne, and the Esquire with
his Speare, which Speare hee cast a∣gainst
the Knight, but the Knight avoi∣ded
it with his sword, and cast it to the
ground. then the Esquire tooke his
Axe, and smote many blowes on the
Knight, and made him let fall his Axe,
and brake up his Vmber three times, &amp;
would have smit him on the face with
his dagger, for to have slaine him; but
then the King cried hold, and so they
were parted: the King made <HI>Iohn An∣sley</HI>
Knight, and the Knight of <HI>Aragon</HI>
offered his Harnesse at <HI>Windsor.</HI></P>
<P>In the yeer 1446. the 24. of <HI>Hen.</HI> the 6.
<HI>Iohn David</HI> appeached his Master <HI>Willi∣am
Cater</HI> of treason:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iohn David</HI> a false ac∣cuser of his ma∣ster: of him was raised the by-word, If ye serve me so, I will call you <HI>Davy.</HI></NOTE> and a day being as∣signed
them to fight in <HI>Smithfield,</HI> the
Master being well beloved, was so che∣rished
by his friends, and plied with
wine, that being therewith overcome,
was also unluckily slaine by his servant.
But that false servant (for he falsly accu∣sed
his Master) lived not long unpuni∣shed;
for he was after hanged at <HI>Teyborn</HI>
for felony.</P>
<P>Let all such false accusers note this for
example, and looke for no better end,
without speedy repentance.</P>
<P>The same yeere, <HI>Thomas Fiiz-Thomas,</HI>
Prior of <HI>Kilmaine,</HI> appeached Sir <HI>Iames
Butler,</HI> Earle of <HI>Ormond,</HI> of treasons:
which had a day assigned them to fight
in <HI>Smithfield,</HI> the Lists were made, and
the field prepared: but when it came
to the point, the King commanded
they should not fight, and tooke the
quarrell into his hands.</P>
<P>In the yeere 1467. the seventh of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>
the fourth, the Bastard of <HI>Burgoigne</HI>
challenged the Lord <HI>Scales,</HI> brother to
the Queene, to fight with him, both on
horse-back and on foot: the King there∣fore
caused Lists to bee prepared in
<HI>Smithfield,</HI> the length of 120. Taylors
yards, and ten foote, and in breadth 80.
yards, and 20. foot, double barred, five
foot betweene the barres, the timber
worke whereof cost 200. Marks, besides
the faire and costly Galleries prepared
for the Ladies and other: at the which
Martiall enterprise, the King and No∣bility
were present. The first day they
ranne together with Speares, and de∣parted
with equall honour.</P>
<P>The next day they turneyed on horse∣backe,
the Lord <HI>Scales</HI> horse having on
his Chafron a long speare pike of steele,
and as the two Champions coaped to∣gether,
the same horse thrust his pike
into the nostrils of the Bastards horse, so
that for very paine, he mounted so high
that he fell on the one side with his Ma∣ster,
and the Lord <HI>Scales</HI> rode about him
with his sword drawne, till the King
commanded the Marshall to helpe up
the Bastard, who said; I cannot hold
by the clouds; for though my horse faile
me, I will not faile an incounter compa∣nion:
but the King would not suffer
them to doe any more that day.</P>
<P>The next morrow they came into the
Lists on foot, with two Pole-Axes, and
fought valiantly, but at the last the point
of the Pole-Axe of the Lord <HI>Scales</HI> en∣tred
into the side of the Bastards Helm;
and by force might have placed him on
his knees: But the King cast downe his
warder, and the Marshall severed them.
The Bastard required that hee might
performe his enterprise: but the King
gave Judgement, as the Bastard relin∣guished
his challenge, &amp;c. And this
may suffice for Iusts in <HI>Smithfield.</HI></P>
<P>But yet we may not part with <HI>Smith∣field</HI>
<PB N="423" REF="222"/>
so:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Smithfield</HI> being con∣tinually subject to extremity of weather by an ho∣nourable motion made, it was paved all over in An. 1614.</NOTE> for, as it hath beene a place for
such honourable Iusts and Triumphs,
by reason it was a soft ground, and un∣paved:
so was it a Market place for
Cattell, Hay, Straw, and other neces∣sary
provisions, and likewise (once in
the yeere) at <HI>Bartholomewtide</HI> a generall
Faire, commonly called <HI>Bartholomew
Faire,</HI> hath usually beene kept in that
place. But in regard that it was conti∣nually
subject to the iniquity of wea∣ther,
and being a place of such goodly
extendure, deserved to be much better
respected; it pleased the Kings Majesty,
with the advice of his honourable Lords
of the Councell, to w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ite graciously to
the Lord Maior and the Aldermen his
Brethren, that <HI>Smithfield</HI> might be suf∣ficiently
paved, which would bee the
onely meanes, whereby to have it kept
in far cleaner condition. And as no mo∣tion
(to any good end and intent) can
be made to the City, but they as gladly
embrace and willingly pursue it: even
so this honourable motion found as ac∣ceptable
entertainment, and it was very
speedily proceeded withall. Some vo∣luntary
contribution in the severall Pa∣rishes
(what each man willingly would
give) was bestowed on the worke; but
(indeed) hardly deserving any report.
Notwithstanding, on the fourth day of
February, <HI>in An. 1614.</HI> the City began
the intended labour, and before <HI>Bartho∣lomewtide</HI>
then next ensuing, to the cre∣dit
and honour of the City for ever,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bartholo</HI>-Faire kept in much better manner, than ever formerly it hath beene.</NOTE> it
was fully finished, and <HI>Bartholomew</HI>
Faire there kept, without breaking any

discreetly ordered, to stand fast upon
the pavement. The Citizens charge
thereof (as I have been credibly told

<P>Then is the Bishop of <HI>Elies Inne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ely</HI> place in <HI>Old∣bourne.</HI></NOTE> so
called of belonging and pertaining to
the Bishops of <HI>Ely. William de Luda,</HI>
Bishop of <HI>Ely,</HI> deceased 1297. and gave
this house, by the name of his Mannour
with the appurtenances in <HI>Oldbourne,</HI>
to his successors, with condition, that
his next successour should pay a thou∣sand
Markes towards the finding of
three Chaplains in the Chappell there.</P>
<P>More, <HI>Iohn Hotham,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Ely,</HI>
did give by the name of sixe Messuages,
two Cellars, and forty Acres of land in
the Suburbs of <HI>London,</HI> in the Parish of
Saint <HI>Andrew</HI> in <HI>Oldbourne,</HI> to the Prior
and Covent of <HI>Ely,</HI> as appeareth by Pa∣tent
the ninth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third: this
man was Bisop of <HI>Ely 20.</HI> yeeres, and
deceased 1336.</P>
<P><HI>Thomas Arundell,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Ely,</HI> beau∣tifully
builded of new his Palace at <HI>Ely,</HI>
and likewise his Mannours in divers
places, especially this in <HI>Oldbourne,</HI>
which he did not only repaire, but ra∣ther
new builded, and augmented it
with a large Port, Gate-house, or Front
towards the street, or high-way: his
Armes are yet to bee discerned in the
stone worke thereof: he fate Bishop of
<HI>Ely</HI> fourteene yeeres, and was translated
to <HI>Yorke.</HI></P>
<P>In this house, for the large and com∣modious
roomes thereof, divers great
and solemne feasts have bin kept, espe∣cially
by the Sergeants at the Law,
whereof twaine are to bee noted for po∣sterity.</P>
<P>The first in the yeer 1464. the fourth
of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sergeants feast in <HI>Ely</HI> house.</NOTE> in <HI>Michaelmas</HI>
Terme, the Sergeants at Law held their
feast in this house, to the which a∣mongst
other Estates, <HI>Matthew Philip,</HI>
Maior of <HI>London,</HI> with the Aldermen,
Sheriffes, &amp; Commons of divers crafts
being invited, did repaire: but when
the Maior looked to keep the State in
the Hall, as it had been used in all pla∣ces
within the City and Liberties (out
of the Kings presence) the Lord <HI>Gray</HI> of
<HI>Ruthen,</HI> then Lord Treasurer of <HI>England,</HI>
unwitting the Sergeants, and against
their wils (as they said) was first placed:
whereupon the Maior, Aldermen, and
Commons departed home, and the
Maior made the Aldermen to dine with
him: howbeit, hee and all the Citizens
were wonderfully displeased, that hee
was so dealt with, and the new Serge∣ants
and others were right sorry there∣fore,
and had rather than much good
(as they said) it had not so happened.</P>
<P>One other feast was likewise there
kept, in the yeere 1531. the 23. of King
<HI>Henry</HI> the eighth. The Sergeants then
made were in number eleven: namely,
<HI>Thomas Audeley, Walter Luke, 1. Bawld∣wine,
1. Hinde, Christopher Ienny, Iohn
Dowsell, Edward Mervine, Edmond
Knightley, Roger Chomley, Edward Mon∣tague,</HI>
and <HI>Robert Yorke.</HI></P>
<P>These also held their feast in this <HI>Ely</HI>
house for five dayes, to wit, Friday the
tenth of November, Saterday, Sunday,
Munday, and Tuesday. On Munday
(which was their principall day) King
<HI>Henry</HI> and Queene <HI>Katharine</HI> dined
there (but in two chambers) and the
forraine Ambassadors in a third cham∣ber.<NOTE PLACE="marg">K. <HI>Henry</HI> the 8. and Queene <HI>Katharine</HI> dined at the Serge∣ants feasts.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the Hall at the high table, sate Sir
<HI>Nicholas Lambard,</HI> Maior of <HI>London,</HI> the
Iudges, the Barons of the Exchequer,
with certaine Aldermen of the City:
At the board on the South side sate the
Master of the Rowles, the Master of the
Chancery, and worshipfull Citizens:
On the North side of the Hall certaine
Aldermen began the board, and then
followed Merchants of the City: In the
Cloystry, Chappell and Gallery,
Knights, Esquires, and Gentlemen
were placed: In the Hals the Crafts of
<HI>London:</HI> the Sergeants of Law and
their Wives kept in their owne cham∣bers.</P>
<P>It were tedious to set downe the pre∣paration
of fish, fles, and other victu∣als
spent in this feast, and would seeme
almost incredible, and (as to mee it see∣meth)
wanted little of a feast at a Coro∣nation:
Neverthelesse a little I will
touch, for declaration of the change of
prices.</P>

<P>Next beyond this Church is <HI>Clif∣fords
Inne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cliffords Inne.</NOTE> sometimes belonging to <HI>Ro∣bert
Clifford,</HI> by gift of <HI>Edward</HI> the se∣cond,
in these words:</P>
<P>The King granteth to <HI>Robert Clifford</HI>
that messuage, with the appurtenances next
the Church of S. <HI>Dunstane</HI> in the West, in
the Suburbs of London, which messuage was
sometime <HI>Malculines de Herley,</HI> and
came to the hands of <HI>Edw.</HI> the 1. by reason
of certaine debts, which the said <HI>Malculine</HI>
was bound at the time of his death to our
said Father, from the time that he was Es∣cheator
on this side <HI>Trent:</HI> which house,
<HI>Iohn,</HI> Earle of <HI>Richmond,</HI> did hold at our
pleasure, and is now in our possession, Patent
the third of <HI>Edward</HI> the second.</P>
<P>After the death of this <HI>Robert Clif∣ford,
Isabel</HI> his wife let the same Messu∣age
to Students of the Law, as by the
Record following may appeare:</P>
<P>Isabel, quae fuit uxor Roberti Clifford,
Messuagium unipartium, quod Robertus
Clifford habuit in Parochia S. Dunstani,
West. in Suburbio Londini, &amp;c. tenuit, &amp;
illud dimisit post mortem dict. Roberti Ap∣prenticiis
de Banco, pro 10. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> Annuatim,
&amp;c. Anno 18. Edvardi tertii, inquisitis
post mortem Roberti Clifford.</P>
<P>This house hath since fallen into the
Kings hands, as I have heard, but retur∣ned
againe to the <HI>Cliffords,</HI> and is now
letten to the said Students for foure
pounds by the yeere.</P>
<P>Somewhat beyond this <HI>Cliffords
Inne</HI> is the South end of <HI>New street</HI> (or
<HI>Chancelar lane)</HI> on the right hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New street. <HI>or</HI> Chance∣lar lane.</NOTE>
whereof is <HI>Sergeants Inne</HI> called, in <HI>Chan∣cery
lane.</HI></P>
<P>And then next was sometime the
house of the Converted Iewes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">House of Converts.</NOTE> founded
by K. <HI>Henry</HI> the third, in place of a Iewes
house to him forfeited, in the yeere
1233. and the 17. of his reigne, who
builded there for them a faire Church,
now used, and called the Chappell, for
the custody of Rolles and Records of
<HI>Chancery.</HI> It standeth not far from the <HI>old
Temple,</HI> but in the mid-way between the
<HI>Old Temple</HI> and the <HI>New:</HI> in the which
house, all such Iewes and Infidels as
were converted to the Christian Faith,
were ordained and appointed (under an
honest rule of life) sufficient mainte∣nance;
whereby it came to passe, that in
short time there were gathered a great
number of Converts, which were bap∣tized,
instructed in the Doctrine of
Christ, and there lived under a learned
Christian, appointed to governe them.
Since the which time, to wit, in the
yeere 1290. all the Iewes in <HI>England</HI>
were banished out of the Realme, wher∣by
the number of Converts in this place
was decayed: and therefore in the yeere
1377. this House was annexed by Pa∣tent
to <HI>William Burstall,</HI> Clerke, <HI>Custos
Rotulorum,</HI> or Keeper of the <HI>Rolles</HI> of
the <HI>Chancery,</HI> by <HI>Edward</HI> the third, in
the fifty one yeere of his reigne; and
this first Master of the <HI>Rolles</HI> was sworn
in <HI>Westminster</HI> Hall, at the Table of
Marble stone: since the which time,
that House hath been commonly called
the <HI>Rolles</HI> in <HI>Chancery lane.</HI> Notwith∣standing,
such of the Iewes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rolles <HI>in</HI> Chancery lane.</NOTE> or other
Insidels, as have in this Realme beene
converted to Christianity, and bapti∣zed,
have beene relieved there: for I
finde in Record, that one <HI>William Piers,</HI>
a Jew, that became a Christian, was
baptized in the fifth of <HI>Richard</HI> the se∣cond,
and had two pence the day al∣lowed
him, during his life, by the said
King.</P>
<P>On the West side,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prior of <HI>Necton</HI> Parke, his Inne or house of the sixe Clerkes.</NOTE> sometime was an
house pertaining to the Prior of <HI>Necton</HI>
Parke, a house of Canons in <HI>Lincoln∣shire:</HI>
this was commonly called <HI>Here∣flete
Inne,</HI> and was a Brewhouse, but
now faire builded for the sixe Clerkes
of the <HI>Chancery,</HI> and standeth over∣against
the said house, called the Rolles,
and neere unto the Lane which now
entreth <HI>Fickets Croft,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fickets croft Shere lane.</NOTE> or <HI>Fickets field.</HI>
Then is <HI>Shere lane,</HI> opening also into
<PB N="436" REF="229"/>
<HI>Fickets field,</HI> hard by the Barres. On
this North side of <HI>Fleetstreet,</HI> in the yeer
of Christ, 1595. I observed, that when
the Labourers had broken up the pave∣ment
from against <HI>Chancery lanes</HI> end,
up towards Saint <HI>Dunstans</HI> Church, and
had digged foure foot deep, they found
one other pavement of hard stone, more
sufficient than the first; and therefore
harder to bee broken, under the which
they found in the made ground piles of
Timber, driven very thicke, and almost
close together, the same being as blacke
as pitch or coale, and many of them
rotten as earth, which proveth that the
ground there (as sundry other places of
the City) have been a Marish or full of
Springs.</P>
<P>On the South side from <HI>Ludgate,</HI> be∣fore
the wall of the City, bee faire buil∣ded
houses to <HI>Fleet bridge,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conduit at <HI>Fleet bridge.</HI></NOTE> on the which
bridge, a Cesterne for receit of Spring
water was made by the men of <HI>Fleet-street,</HI>

<P>Next,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bridewell</HI> the Kings house.</NOTE> is <HI>Bride lane,</HI> and therein <HI>Bride∣well,</HI>
of old time the Kings house: for the

Kings house wheresoever hee was lodg∣ed,
as may appeare by ancient Records,
where of I have seene many, and for ex∣ample

<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth builded there
a stately and beautiful house of new, for

who in the yeere of Christ 1522. was

himselfe oftentimes lodged there also,
as namely, in the yeere 1525. a Parlia∣ment

<P>In the yeere 1528. Cardinall <HI>Campeius</HI>
was brought to the Kings presence, be∣ing
then at <HI>Bridewell,</HI> whither hee had
called all his Nobility, Judges and

of November, in his great Chamber, he
made unto them an Oration touching
his marriage with Queene <HI>Katharine,</HI> as

<P>These knights <HI>Templers</HI> tooke their

maner following:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Originall of the Templers.</NOTE> Certaine Noblemen,

vow themselves in the hands of the

after the manner of Regular Canons, in
chastity and obedience, and to renounce
their owne proper wils for ever: the
first of which order were <HI>Hugh Paganus,</HI>
and <HI>Geffrey de S. Andromare.</HI> And wher∣as
at the first they had no certaine habi∣tation,
<HI>Baldwin,</HI> King of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> gran∣ted
unto them a dwelling place in his
Palace by the Temple, and the Cannons
of the same Temple, gave them the
street, thereby to build therein their
houses of office, and the Patriarke, the
King, the Nobles, and the Prelates,
gave unto them certaine revenues out
of their Lordships.</P>
<P>Their first profession was for safegard
of the Pilgrimes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Profession of the Templers.</NOTE> comming to visit the
Sepulchre, and to keepe the high waies
against the lying in wait of theeves, &amp;c.
About ten yeeres after, they had a rule
appointed unto them, and a white Ha∣bite,
by <HI>Honorius</HI> the second, then Pope;
and whereas they had but nine in num∣ber,
they began to increase greatly. Af∣terward
in Pope <HI>Eugenius</HI> time, they
bare crosse of red cloth on their upper∣most
garments, to be knowne from o∣thers:
and in short time, because they
had their first mansion hard by the
Temple of our Lord in <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> they
were called <HI>Knights of the Temple.</HI></P>
<P>Many Noblemen in all parts of Chri∣stendome,
became Brethren of this or∣der,
and builded for themselves Tem∣ples
in every City or great Towne in
<HI>England,</HI> but this at <HI>London</HI> was their
chefe house, which they builded after
the forme of the Temple neere to the
Sepulchre of our Lord at <HI>Ierusalem.</HI>
They had also other Temples in <HI>Cam∣bridge,

had much treasure laid up in this <HI>New

whereupon hee sent for the Ma∣ster
of the Temple, and examined him
straightly, who confessed, that money
being delivered unto him and his Bre∣thren,
to bee kept, hee knew not how
much there was of it: The King de∣manded
to have the same delivered:
but it was answered, that the money be∣ing
cōmitted unto their trust, could not
be delivered, without the licence of him
that committed it to Ecclesiasticall pro∣tection;
whereupon the King sent his
Treasurer and Iusticier of the Exche∣quer
unto <HI>Hubert,</HI> to require him to re∣signe
the mony wholly into his hands:
who answered that hee would gladly
submit himselfe and all his unto the
Kings pleasure, and thereupon desired
the Knights of the Temple (in his be∣halfe)
to present all the Keyes unto the
King to doe his pleasure with the goods
which hee had committed unto them.
Then the King commanded the money
to bee faithfully told, and laid up in
his Treasure by Inventory, wherein was
found (besides ready money) vessels of
Gold, and Silver unpraiseable, and ma∣ny
precious Stones, which would make
all men wonder, if they knew the worth
of them.</P>
<P>This Temple was againe dedicated
1240. belike also newly re-edified then.</P>
<P>These Templers at this time were in
so great glory, that they entertained the
Nobility, forraine Ambassadours, and
the Prince himselfe very often,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. Paris.</NOTE> inso∣much
that <HI>Mathew Paris</HI> cryeth out on

to serve two of them, in token whereof
they gave in their Seale, two men ri∣ding
on one horse;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seale of the Tem∣plers.</NOTE> yet suddenly they
waxed so insolent, that they disdained

<P>King <HI>Edward</HI> the first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30. Dun∣mow.</NOTE> in the yeere
1283. taking with him <HI>Robert Waleran</HI>

calling for the keeper of the Treasure∣house,
as if he meant to see his Mothers
Iewels, that were laid up there to bee
safely kept, hee entred into the house,
breaking the Coffers of certaine per∣sons,
that had likewise brought their
mony thither, and he tooke away from
thence to the value of 1000. <ABBR>l.</ABBR></P>
<P>Many Parliaments and great Coun∣cels

In the yeere 1308. all the <HI>Templers</HI> in
<HI>England,</HI> as also in other parts of Chri∣stendome,
were apprehended and com∣mitted
to divers prisons.</P>
<P>In 1310. a Provinciall Councell was
holden at <HI>London</HI> against the <HI>Templers</HI>
in <HI>England,</HI> upon heresie, and other Ar∣ticles
whereof they were accused, but
denyed all except one or two of them:
Notwithstanding, they all did confesse,
that they could not purge themselves
fully, as faultlesse, and so they were con∣demned
to perpetuall penance, in seve∣rall
Monasteries, where they behaved
themselves modestly.</P>
<P><HI>Philip,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The order of Tem∣plers con∣demned.</NOTE> King of <HI>France,</HI> procured their
over-throw through-out the whole

therefore seizing the same in his hands,
(as I have read) caused the <HI>Templers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rob. Fabian.</NOTE> to
the number of 54. or after <HI>Fabian,</HI> three∣score,
to be burnt at <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Edward</HI> the second, in the yeere 1313.

all the Lands of the <HI>Templers</HI> (lest the

<HI>Iuly,</HI> in the said fourth yeere of the
raigne of King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, and in
the time of the Maioraltie of the said

<P>And that the said Lord Maior for the

<P>And that the said Alderman so espe∣cially
elect and chosen, and from time
to time, as the cause sould require
thenceforth, to be elect and chosen for
the Survey and Government of the said
Borough, and the Inhabitants and other

of the said Citie be commonly
charged: And therein to doe and use
himselfe, as other Aldermen within the
Liberties of the said Citie were accu∣stomed
and used to doe, in as much as
the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme
would permit and suffer.</P>
<P>Yet neverthelesse it was prouided, &amp;
by the said Cōmon Councell further or∣dained
and enacted, That the said Sir
<PB N="447" REF="234"/>
<HI>Iohn Ayliffe,</HI> Knight, should then be Al∣derman
of the said Ward: And that as
well the same Sir <HI>Iohn Ayliffe,</HI> as also all

duely elect and chosen unto by the In∣habitants
of the same other VVard, or
VVards, or any of them in like manner
and forme, as the other Aldermen of
the said City lawfully might, and com∣monly
use to doe: Any thing in the said
recited Act to the contrary in any wise
notwithstanding.</P>
<P>Neverthelesse, at a Court of Alder∣men
holden on Tuesday, the second of
September, in the said fourth yeere of
the reigne of king <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, and
in the time of the Maioralty of the said
Sir <HI>Rowland Hill,</HI> it was ordered, That
the Aldermen of <HI>Bridge Ward without,</HI>
for the time being,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Al∣derman of <HI>Bridge Ward with∣out</HI> to con∣tinue so for the space of 3▪ yeeres, without removing.</NOTE> should stand and re∣maine
Alderman of the same VVard
three whole yeeres next after his electi∣on,
before hee should bee permitted to
bee removed to the governance of any
other VVard: Notwithstanding any
former Law, Vsage, or Custome.</P>
<P>But afterwards it seemeth, upon bet∣ter
advice, that another order should be
taken in the election of the Alderman
of the same Ward: For at a Common
Councell holden in the Guild-Hall in
<HI>London,</HI> on the 16. day of Iune, in the
fourth and fifth yeeres of King <HI>Philip</HI>
and Queene <HI>Mary,</HI> and in the time of
the Maioralty of Sir <HI>Thomas Curtis,</HI>
Knight, the said former Act, made on
the last day of Iuly, in the fourth yeere
of King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth, for so much
thereof as did concerne the forme and
order of the election of the Alderman
of the said VVard of <HI>Bridge Ward with∣out,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">4. Another order for electing the Alder∣man of <HI>Bridge Ward with∣out,</HI> in the time of K. <HI>Philip</HI> &amp; Queen <HI>Mary.</HI></NOTE> was utterly repealed. And then it
was enacted, That from thenceforth
the Alderman of the same Ward should
alwaies, at the time of vacation, or lack
of an Alderman thereof, be elected and
chosen by the Lord Maior and Alder∣men
of <HI>London,</HI> for the time being, at a
full Court of Aldermen, by them to be
holden in the Inner Chamber of the
Guild-Hall of the same City in this
manner, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Lord Maior and
Aldermen should at their said full
Court, amongst themselves, nominate
foure discreet and meet Citizens, being
Freemen of <HI>London,</HI> either resiant with∣in
the said Borough, or in <HI>London,</HI> or the
Liberties thereof, to be put in election
of Alderman of that Ward. And of the
said foure persons so nominated, the
said Lord Maior and Aldermen should
by Scrutiny, according to their accusto∣med
manner, elect one to bee Alder∣man
of the same VVard: VVhich Al∣derman,
so by them elected and sworne,
should use and behave himselfe in all
things, as by the residue of the former
Act of Common Councell, made the
last day of Iuly, in the fourth yeere of
King <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth was ordained
and appointed.</P>
<P>Thus having declared, by what means
and at what time the said Borough of
<HI>Southwarke</HI> was made and named one
of the sixe and twenty VVards, now
belonging to the City of <HI>London;</HI> I in∣tend
to proceed to the description of
the severall particular places of the
same VVard, and likewise of such Mo∣numents
of Antiquity, as are to bee
found therein.</P>
<P>This Borough being in the County
of <HI>Surrey,</HI> consisteth of divers streetes,
waies, and winding lanes, all full of
buildings inhabited: and first, to begin
at the West part thereof, over-against
the West Suburbe of the City.</P>
<P>On the banke of the River <HI>Thames,</HI>
there is now a continuall building of
Thenements, about halfe a mile in length
to the Bridge.</P>
<P>Then South a continuall street called
<HI>Long Southwarke,</HI> builded on both sides
with divers Lanes and Allies up to St.
<HI>Georges</HI> Church, and beyond it thorow
<HI>Blackman street,</HI> towards <HI>Newtowne</HI> (or
<HI>Newington)</HI> the liberties of which Bo∣rough
extend almost to the Parish
Church of <HI>Newtowne</HI> aforesaid, distant
one mile from <HI>London bridge,</HI> and also
Southwest a continuall building, almost
to <HI>Lambith,</HI> more than one mile from
the said Bridge.</P>
<P><PB N="448" REF="235"/>
Then from the Bridge along by the
<HI>Thames</HI> Eastward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. <HI>Olaves</HI> street.</NOTE> is S. <HI>Olaves street,</HI> ha∣ving
continuall building on both the
sides, with lanes and Alleyes up to <HI>Bat∣tle
bridge,</HI> to <HI>Horse-downe,</HI> and towards
<HI>Rother-hith:</HI> also some good halfe mile
in length from <HI>London bridge.</HI></P>
<P>So that I account the whole continu∣all
buildings on the Banke of the said
River, from the West towards the East,
to be more than a large mile in length.</P>
<P>Then have yee from the entring to∣wards
the said <HI>Horsedowne,</HI> one other
continuall street, called <HI>Barmondes eye
strees,</HI> which stretcheth South, likewise
furnished with buildings on both sides,
almost halfe a mile in length, up to the
late dissolved Monastery of S. <HI>Saviour,</HI>
called <HI>Bermondsey.</HI></P>
<P>And from thence is one long lane (so
called of the length) turning West to
Saint <HI>Georges</HI> Church afore-named.
Out of the which lane mentioned <HI>Long
lane,</HI> breaketh one other street towards
the South and by East, and this is called
<HI>Kentish street,</HI> for that it is the way lea∣ding
into that Country: and so have
you the bounds of this Borough.</P>
<P>The Antiquities most notable in this
Borough are these: first, for Ecclesiasti∣call,
there was <HI>Bermondsey,</HI> an Abbey of
blacke Monkes, Saint <HI>Mary Overies,</HI> a
Priory of Canons Regular, Saint <HI>Thomas</HI>
a Colledge or Hospitall for the poore,
and the <HI>Loke,</HI> a Lazar-house in <HI>Kent
street.</HI> Parish Churches there have been
sixe, whereof five doe remaine, <HI>(viz.)</HI>
Saint <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> in the Priory of
Saint <HI>Mary Overy:</HI> now the same Saint
<HI>Mary Overy</HI> is the Parish Church for
the said <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> and for Saint
<HI>Margaret</HI> on the Hill, and is called St.
<HI>Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>Saint <HI>Margaret</HI> on the Hill being put
downe, is now a Court for Iustice. S.
<HI>Thomas</HI> in the Hospitall serveth for a
Parish Church, as afore, Saint <HI>George</HI>
a Parish Church, as before it did:
So doth Saint <HI>Olave,</HI> and Saint <HI>Ma∣ry
Magdalen,</HI> by the Abby of <HI>Bermond∣sey.</HI></P>
<P>There be also these five Prisons, or Gaoles.</P>
<P>The <HI>Clinke,</HI> on the Banke.</P>
<P>The <HI>Compter,</HI> in the late Parish▪</P>
<P>Church of S. <HI>Margaret.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Marshalsey.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Kings Bench.</P>
<P><HI>And the</HI> White Lion; <HI>all in</HI> Long South∣warke.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Houses most notable, be these.</HEAD>
<P>The Bishop of <HI>Winchesters</HI> House.</P>

<P>The <HI>Stewes</HI> on the Banke of <HI>Thames.</HI></P>
<P>And the <HI>Beare-Gardens</HI> there.</P>
<P>Now to returne to the West Banke:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Beare Gardens▪</NOTE>
there were two <HI>Beare-Gardens,</HI> the Old

Beares, Buls, and other Beasts, to be bay∣ted:
As also Mastives, in severall kenels,
nourished to baite them. These Beares,
and other Beasts are there baited in
plots of ground, scaffolded about, for
the beholders to stand safe.</P>
<P>Next, on this Banke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Liber Ma∣nuscript.</NOTE> was sometime
the <HI>Bordello</HI> or <HI>Stewes,</HI> a place so called,
of certaine Stew-houses priviledged
there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Stewes</HI> on the Bank-side.</NOTE> for the repaire of incontinent

<P>In a Parliament holden at <HI>Westmin∣ster,</HI>
the eighth of <HI>Henry</HI> the second, it
was ordained by the Commons, and confir∣med
by the King and Lords, That di∣vers
Constitutions for ever should be kept
within that Lordship, or Franchise, accor∣ding
to the old Customes, that had beene
there used time time of minde: Amongst
the which, these following were some: <HI>vi∣delicet.</HI></P>
<P>That no Stew-holder, or his wife, should
let or stay any single woman to goe and
come freely at all times, when they li∣sted.</P>
<P>No Stew-holder to keepe any woman to

<P>To take no more for the womans chamber

<P><PB N="449" REF="235"/>
Not to keepe open his doores upon the Ho∣ly-dayes.</P>
<P>Not to keepe any single woman in his

<P>No Stew-holder receive any woman of

<P>No single woman to take mony to lye with

<P>No man to be drawne or enticed into any

<P>These and many more Orders were
to bee observed, upon great paine and
punishment.</P>
<P>I have also seene divers Patents of

the ninetenth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third.<NOTE PLACE="marg">English people disdayned to bee Bawds.</NOTE> Also
I finde, that in the fourth of <HI>Richard</HI> the

spoyled by <HI>Walter Tylar,</HI> and other Re∣bels

that ordinances for the same place, and
houses, were againe confirmed in the

as before.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rob. Fabian.</NOTE> Also <HI>Robert Fabian</HI>
writeth, that in the yeere 1506. the one

said Stew-houses in <HI>Southwarke</HI> were
(for a season) inhabited, and the doores
closed up: but it was not long (saith he)
ere the houses there were set open a∣gaine,
so many as were permitted, for
(as it was said) whereas before were
eighteen houses, from thenceforth were
appointed to be used but twelve onely.
These allowed Stew-houses had signes
on their fronts, towards the <HI>Thames,</HI>
not hanged out, but painted on the wals
as a Boares head,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Signes on the Stew-houses.</NOTE> the Crosse keyes, the
Gunne, the Castle, the Crane, the Car∣dinals
Hat, the Bell, the Swanne, &amp;c.
I have heard ancient men of good cre∣dit
report, that these single women
were forbidden the rights of the
Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Single women forbidden rights of the Church.</NOTE> so long as they continued that
sinnefull life, and were excluded from
Christian buriall, if they were not re∣conciled
before their death. And ther∣fore
there was a plot of ground, called
the <HI>Single womens Churchyard,</HI> appointed
for them, far from the Parish Church.</P>
<P>In the yeere of Christ, a thousand five
hundred forty sixe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stew-hou∣ses put downe.</NOTE> the seven and thir∣tieth
of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, this row
of Stewes in <HI>Southwarke</HI> was put downe
by the Kings commandement, which
was proclaimed by sound of Trumpet
no more to be priviledged, and used as
a common <HI>Brothel;</HI> but the inhabitants
of the same to keepe good and honest
rule, as in other places of this Realm, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Then next is the <HI>Clinke,</HI> a Gaole or
Prison for the Trespassers in those parts;
namely, in old time for such as should
brabble, fray, or breake the peace on
the said Banke, or in the <HI>Brothell</HI> hou∣ses,
they were by the inhabitants there∣about
apprehended and committed to
this Gaole, where they were straightly
imprisoned.</P>
<P>Next is the Bishop of <HI>Winchesters</HI>
house,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Winchester</HI> house.</NOTE> or lodging when he commeth to
this City: which house was first buil∣ded
by <HI>William Gifford,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Win∣chester,</HI>
about the yeere one thousand,
one hundred and seven, the seventh of
<HI>Henry</HI> the first, upon a plot of ground
pertaining to the Prior of <HI>Bermondsey,</HI>
as appeareth by a Writ directed unto
the Barons of the Exchequer, in the
yeere 1366. the one and fortieth of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>
the third (the Bishops Sea being
void) for 8. pounds due to the Monkes
of <HI>Bermondsey,</HI> for the Bishop of <HI>Winche∣sters</HI>
lodging in <HI>Southwarke.</HI> This is a
very faire house wel repayred, and hath
a large Wharfe, and a landing place cal∣led
the Bishop of <HI>Winchesters</HI> staires.</P>
<P>Adjoyning to this on the South side
thereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rochester</HI> house.</NOTE> is the Bishop of <HI>Rochesters</HI> Inne
or lodging, by whom first erected I doe
not now remember me to have read, but
well I wot, the same of long time
hath not beene frequented by any Bi∣shop,
and lyeth ruinous for lacke of re∣parations.
The Abbot of <HI>Naverley</HI> had
a house there.</P>
<P>East from the Bishop of <HI>Winchesters</HI>
house, directly over-against it standeth
<PB N="450" REF="236"/>
a faire Church, called S. <HI>Mary</HI> over the
<HI>Rie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saint <HI>Ma∣ry Overies</HI> a Priory, and now a Parish Church.</NOTE> or <HI>Overy,</HI> that is, over the water.
This Church, or some other in place
thereof, was (of old time long before the
Conquest) an house of Sisters, founded
by a Maiden, named <HI>Mary,</HI> unto the
which house and Sisters she left (as was
left to her by her Parents) the over-sight
and profits of a Crosse Ferrie, or traverse
Ferry over the <HI>Thames,</HI> there kept be∣fore
that any Bridge was builded. This
house of Sisters was after by <HI>Swithen</HI> a
noble Lady, converted unto a Colledge
of Priests, who in place of the Ferrie,
builded a Bridge of Timber, and from
time to time kept the same in good re∣parations;
but lastly the same Bridge
was builded of Stone, and then in the
yeere 1106. was this Church againe
founded for Canons Regular, by <HI>William
Pont de le Arch,</HI> and <HI>William Dauncy,</HI>
Knights <HI>Normans.</HI></P>
<P><HI>William Gifford,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI>
was a good Benefactor also,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. Rufen.</NOTE> for hee (as
some have noted) builded the body of
that Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Liber Ber∣mondsey.</NOTE> in the yeere one thou∣sand,
one hundred and sixe, the seventh
of <HI>Henry</HI> the first.</P>
<P>The Canons first entred the said
Church, then <HI>Algodus</HI> was the first Prior.</P>
<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> the first, by his Charter
gave them the Church of Saint <HI>Marga∣ret</HI>
in <HI>Southwarke.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>Stephen</HI> confirmeth the gift of
King <HI>Henry,</HI> and also gave the Stone
House, which was <HI>William de Ponte le
Arche,</HI> by <HI>Downgate.</HI></P>
<P>This Priory was burned about the
yeere 1207. wherefore the Canons did
found an Hospitall neere unto their Pri∣ory,
where they celebrated untill the
Priory was repayred: which Hospi∣tall
was after (by consent of <HI>Peter de la
Roch,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Winchester)</HI> removed into
the land of <HI>Anicins,</HI> Archdeacon of <HI>Sur∣rey,</HI>
in the yeere 1228. a place where
the water was more plentifull, and the
ayre more wholsome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S. <HI>Thomas</HI> Hospitall.</NOTE> and was dedica∣ted
to S. <HI>Thomas.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Peter de Rupibus,</HI> or <HI>de la Roch,</HI>

Magdalen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parish Church of S. <HI>Mary Magdalen.</HI></NOTE> in the said Church of St.
<HI>Mary Overy,</HI> which chappell was after∣ward
appointed to be the Parish Church
for the inhabitants neere adjoyning.</P>
<P>This Church was again newly builded
in the reigne of <HI>Richard</HI> the second and
King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth.</P>

short time, and were returned backe a∣gaine
to the aforesaid <HI>White Lion,</HI> there
to remaine, as the appointed Gaole for
the County of <HI>Surrey.</HI></P>
<P>Next, is the Gaole or Prison of the
<HI>Kings Bench,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Kings Bench.</NOTE> but of what antiquity the
same is, I know not. For I have read,
that the Courts of the <HI>Kings Bench</HI> and
<HI>Chancery,</HI> have oft times been removed
from <HI>London</HI> to other places, and so hath
likewise the other Gaoles that serve
those Courts, as in the yeere 1304. <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>
the first commanded the Courts
of the <HI>Kings Bench</HI> and the <HI>Exchequer,</HI>
which had remained seven yeeres at
<HI>Yorke,</HI> to be removed to their old places
at <HI>London.</HI> And in the yeere 1387. the
eleventh of <HI>Richard</HI> the second, <HI>Robert
Trisilian</HI> chiefe Iustice, came to the Ci∣tie
of <HI>Coventry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">H. Knighton▪</NOTE> and there sate by the
space of a moneth, as Iustice of the <HI>Kings
Benche,</HI> and caused to be indited in that
Court, about the number of 2000. per∣sons
of that Country, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It seemeth therefore, that for that
time, the Prison or Gaole of that Court
was not far off. Also, in the yeere 1392.
the sixteenth of the same <HI>Richard,</HI> the
Archbishop of <HI>Yorke</HI> being Lord Chan∣cellor,
for good will that he bare to his
City, caused the <HI>Kings Bench</HI> and Chan∣cery
to bee removed from <HI>London</HI> to
<HI>Yorke,</HI> but ere long they were returned
to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Then is the <HI>Marshalsey</HI> another Gaole
or Prison,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marshalsey <HI>in</HI> South∣warke.</NOTE> so called, as pertaining to the
Marshals of <HI>England.</HI> Of what continu∣ance
kept in <HI>Southwarke,</HI> I have not lear∣ned:
but like it is, that the same hath
been removeable, at the pleasure of the
Marshals. For I finde, that in the yeere
1376. the 50. of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Hen∣ry
Percy</HI> (being Marshall) kept his pri∣soners
in the City of <HI>London,</HI> where ha∣ving
committed one <HI>Iohn Prendargest,</HI>
of <HI>Norwich,</HI> contrary to the liberties of
the City of <HI>London,</HI> the Citizens, by per∣swasion
of the Lord <HI>Fitzwalter,</HI> their
Standard-bearer, tooke armour, and
ranne with great rage to the <HI>Marshals
Inne,</HI> brake up the gates, brought out
the prisoner, and conveighed him a∣way,
minding to have burnt the stockes
in the middest of their City; but they
first sought for Sir <HI>Henry Percy,</HI> to have
punished him, as I have noted in my
Annals.</P>
<P>More, about the Feast of Easter next
following, <HI>Iohn</HI> Duke of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> ha∣ving
caused all the whole Navie of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
to be gathered together at <HI>London,</HI>
it chanced a certaine Esquire to kill one
of the Mariners, which act the other
Mariners taking in ill part, they brought
their suit into the Kings Court of the
<HI>Marshalsey,</HI> which then as chanced (saith
mine Author) was kept in <HI>Southwarke:</HI>
but when they perceived that Court to
<PB N="456" REF="239"/>
be so favourable to the murderer; and
further, that the Kings Warrant was
also gotten for his pardon; they in great
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ury ranne to the house, wherein the
murderer was imprisoned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saylers brake up the <HI>Mar∣shalsey.</HI></NOTE> brake into
it, and brought forth the prisoner with
his Gives on his legges, they thrust a
kni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to his heart, and sticked him, as if
hee had beene a Hogge: after this they
tyed a rope to his Gives, and drew him
to the Gallowes, where when they had
hanged him, as though they had done
a great act, they caused the Trumpets
to bee sounded before them to their
ships, and there in great triumph they
spent the rest of the day.</P>
<P>Also the Rebels of <HI>Kent,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rebels of <HI>Kent</HI> brake up the <HI>Marshalsey.</HI></NOTE> in the yeere
1381. brake downe the houses of the
<HI>Marshalsey</HI> and <HI>Kings Bench</HI> in <HI>South∣warke,</HI>
tooke from thence the prisoners,
brake downe the house of Sir <HI>Iohn Im∣morth,</HI>
then Marshall of the <HI>Marshalsey,</HI>
and <HI>Kings Bench,</HI> &amp;c. After this, in the
yeere 1387. the eleventh of <HI>Richard</HI> the
second, the morrow after <HI>Bartholomew
day,</HI> the King kept a great Councell in
the Castle of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and the <HI>Mar∣shalsey</HI>
of the King was then kept at
<HI>Lughborow,</HI> by the space of sixe daies or
more. In the yeere 1443. Sir <HI>Walter
Many,</HI> was Marshall of the <HI>Marshalsey,</HI>
the two and twentieth of <HI>Henry</HI> the
sixth. <HI>William Brandon,</HI> Esquire, was
Marshall in the eighth of <HI>Edward</HI> the
fourth. In the yeere 1504. the priso∣ners
of the <HI>Marshalsey</HI> then in <HI>Southwark</HI>
brake out, and many of them being ta∣ken
were executed, especially such as
had beene committed for Felony or
Treason.</P>
<P>From thence towards <HI>London bridge,</HI>

Know ye, that we have altogether re∣mised

Covent of the same, and their successors,
suit to our Court of <HI>Southwarke,</HI> which

we have granted in perpetuall Almes to

the service due to any other persons, if
any such be, then to us. And for this remit
and grant, the said Abbot and Covent have
given unto us five shillings of rent yeerely
in <HI>Southwarke,</HI> and have received us
and our heires in all Benefices, which shall
be in their Church for ever.</P>
<P>This sute of Court one <HI>William Cras∣peis</HI>

<P>This house seemeth to have taken
beginning, with the first founding of
the Bridge; either of stone or timber:
it is a large plot of ground on the banke
of the river <HI>Thames,</HI> containing divers
large buildings, for stowage of things
necessary, towards reparation of the
said Bridge.</P>
<P>There are also divers Garners,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Garners for Come in the <HI>Bridge-house.</HI></NOTE> for
laying up of Wheate, and other Gray∣ners
for service of the City, as need re∣quireth.
Moreover, there bee certaine
Ovens builded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ovens in the <HI>Bridge-house.</HI></NOTE> in number ten: of which
sixe bee very large, the other foure be∣ing
but halfe so bigge. These were
purposely made to bake out the bread∣corne
of the said Grayners, to the best
advantage, for reliefe of the poore Citi∣zens,
when neede should require. Sir <HI>I.
Throstone,</HI> Knight, sometime an Im∣broderer,
then Goldsmith, one of the
Sheriffes, 1516. gave (by his Testa∣ment)
towards the making of these
Ovens two hundred pounds, which
thing was performed by his Executors:

<P>Then is <HI>Battaile bridge,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Battaile bridge.</NOTE> so called of

<P><HI>Robert Blewit,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Lincolne</HI>

President of the Colledge of Physici∣ans,
accompanied with sixe other Doctors
of Physicke of that Society, as
likewise, that some of the Aldermen
should upon view of the said workes,

And thereupon doe humbly certifie

that the workes standing in that
place, must necessarily breed great an∣noyances
both to the neere Inhabitants,
and by the spreading vapours from
thence issuing to many places more re∣mote,
and to all such passengers as ei∣ther

works in and about the City, were
fit to bee supprest. Neverthelesse, for
that a Petition was now presented to
the Boord by the Farmers of the said
Allome workes, shewing that it was
not possible for them to erect and finish
any new workes in the Country before
our <HI>Lady day</HI> next, and that if they
should be restrained from working here
in the meane time, the Kingdome
would be unserved of Allome, of which
<PB N="466" REF="244"/>
there is great use, and they likewise dis∣abled
to pay his Maiesties rent. And
therefore besought the Boord that they
might have leave to proceed in their
making of Allome here untill our Lady
day next as aforesaid. It was thereupon
thought fit &amp; ordered that they should
be at liberty to make Allome in those
places where their works are already e∣rected
untill our Lady day next only
and no longer; and that in the meane
time they presume not to erect any o∣ther
works in any places in or about this
cittie; Provided neverthelesse that they
suffer not the dreggs and excrement
proceeding from the boyling and ma∣king
of the said Allom to be cast or fall
into any places leading into the River of
<HI>Thames,</HI> but that they cause the same
from time to time to be either buried in
the night time in the grounds where
their works now are, or otherwise to be
carried and buried in the night time in
some other convenient place, where
the same may breed no infection or an∣noyance

White-Chappell, Stepney, Reddriffe,</HI> S. <HI>O∣laves,</HI>
and others adjacent and neere his
Majesties Tower of <HI>London.</HI> Shewing
that whereas it had pleased the boord
(on the 27. of <HI>Iuly</HI> last, after divers hea∣rings
and reports made by six Doctors
of the Colledge of Physitions of <HI>London)</HI>
to order that the Farmer of his Maje∣sties
Allome works (who had transpor∣ted
themselves out of the Northerne
parts of the Kingdome neere unto his
Majesties Royall chamber and Citty of
<HI>London)</HI> should not presume to erect any
other worke in or about, nor suffer the
dreggs or excrement of the boiling of
Allom to be cast or fall into the river of
<HI>Thames,</HI> but bury the same in the night
time in some convenient place where it
might not breed any infection or annoy∣ance,
yet neverthelesse that sithence the
making of the said order, and especially
on the 16. of <HI>August</HI> last the said Far∣mers,
their deputies or assignes, have in
contempt of the order, powred or cau∣sed
the said filth, dreggs or excremēts to
fall into the Ponds or ditches leading to
the <HI>Thames,</HI> wherby some of the Petitio∣ners
have found their wells of water ap∣pointed
for brewing so tainted with the
tast &amp; savour of Allom excremēt, as that
within a very short space the Fish have
been poisoned, and the water altogether
unwholesome, for brewing or any other
use, as by certificate under divers of the
said Petitioners hands the chiefe offi∣cers
and inhabitants of the Tower ap∣peared,
and therfore humbly prayed re∣dresse
of the growing mischiefe and
dangerous contagion proceeding from
the said Allom works, seconded with a
presumptuous cōtempt of the said order
of the Boord, to the end that by a sud∣den
reformation the Petitioners may
enjoy the benefit of the aire, and not be
suffocated with the horrid and putrid
savours occasioned by the said Allom
works. The Boord taking this com∣plaint
into their due and serious consi∣deration
and finding that the former or∣der
of the boord was not observed, as is
before mentioned and that the annoy∣ance
caused hereby, extendeth it selfe to
the extreme parts of the Citty, and
even so farre as his Majesties Court
when the wind sitteth that way (which
cannot but be of dangerous consequence
by corrupting of both the aire and the
water, whereof beere is made for his
Majesties service &amp; otherwise:) thought
fit and ordered that the said Allom
workes: should be presently suppressed
from working, and utterly removed by
the Farmers or others whom it may
concerne within a convenient time, not∣withstanding
the former order (which
on their parts have not been observed)
and that some one of the Messengers of
<PB N="467" REF="244"/>
his Majesties Chamber shalbe sent with
a transcript of this their Lordships or∣der,
to the Farmers or deputies of
the said worke, and see the same due∣ly
executed, and of the performance
thereof to give accompt to their Lord∣ships
within ten or twelve dayes af∣ter
the date hereof. And of this their
Lordships order as well the said Far∣mers
&amp; the Messenger, as others whom
it may concerne, are to take notice, and
to regulate themselves accordingly, as
they will answere the contrary.</P>

being of the Colledge of Physitians <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
to order that the Farmers of his Ma∣jesties

<P>VVHereas by an Order of
this Boord, made in
<HI>Iuly</HI> last, for reasons in
the said order mentioned, the Allome
works were suffered to be in those places
neere <HI>London,</HI> where they were then
erected, untill our Lady day next only
and no longer. And afterwards the 12.
of September last for contempts, in not
pursuing the said order of the 25. of <HI>Iu∣ly,</HI>
and for prevention of growing mis∣chiefe
that might come by sufferance of
the said Allome works; it was ordered
that the said Allome works should be
presently suppressed, &amp; removed; which
being not as yet done, although the Far∣mers
of the said works have sought out
other places, whither to remove the said
works. Now the Boord upon the peti∣tion
of the Company of Diers, being in∣formed
that in these times of warrs, and
danger, the Dyers and other Artificers
using Allome cannot be furnished with
that commodity, from any other per∣sons,
or places, but onely from the Far∣mers
aforesaid, and their Magazines.
And that the said artificers, for want
thereof shall be forced to give over their
Trades to the great dammage of the
Commonweale. And the said Farmers
informing that by reason of some Ship∣wracks,
and the danger of passages
from out of the North hither, they have
failed, nor cannot bring their Alloms
hither to <HI>London,</HI> as they were wont. In
consideration of all which; and for that
their Lordships doe conceive that the
said works will be lesse offensive to the
Inhabitants dwelling in those parts in
this winter season, the Boord hath
thought fit and ordered, that the said
Farmers, their Deputies, and Assignes,
shall be permitted, untill our Lady day
next according to the permission given
by the former order of the 25. of <HI>Iuly,</HI> to
convert the Materialls now upon their
hands into Allome, at their house in S.
<HI>Katharines,</HI> erected for that purpose, and
to sell the same, for the use of his Maje∣sties
subjects: And presently upon our
Lady day next to remove the said
works to some other place more remote
from the Citty of <HI>London,</HI> and the Sub∣urbs
thereof. And it is ordered, that
in the meane while the said Farmers,
their Deputies and Assignes, or some of
them shall seeke, and find out some
convenient place for their said works,
&amp; signifie unto the Boord of what place
they have made choice, to the end they
may have their Lordships allowance
and approbation, for their Settlement
in the same, whereof all persons whom
it may concerne, are to take knowledge,
and accordingly to governe themselves,
as they and every of them will answere
the contrary at their perills. Provided
always, and it is hereby willed and com∣manded,
that all things else required
and set downe to be done by the said
Farmers, in either of the said Orders, be∣fore
mentioned, concerning the excre∣ment
of the Allome, &amp; otherwise what∣soever,
be duly observed and performed
by the said Farmers of the said Allome
works.</P>
<P>On the East side, and by North of
the Tower, lieth <HI>East-Smithfield,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nightingall lane.</NOTE> <HI>Hogs
streete,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">East Smith∣field.</NOTE> and <HI>Tower hill,</HI> and East from
them both, was the new Abbey called
<HI>Grace,</HI> founded by <HI>Edward</HI> the third.
From thence <HI>Radeliffe,</HI> up <HI>East Smith∣field,</HI>
by <HI>Nightingall lane,</HI> (which run∣neth
South to the Hermitage, a Brew∣house
<PB N="469" REF="245"/>
so called of an Hermite sometime
being there,)<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bramley.</NOTE> beyond this lane to the
Mannor of <HI>Bramley</HI> (called in Record of
<HI>Richard</HI> the second, <HI>Villa East Smithfield,</HI>
and <HI>Villa de Bramley)</HI> and to the Man∣nor
of <HI>Shadwell,</HI> belonging to the Deane
of <HI>Pauls,</HI> there hath been of late, in place
of Elme trees, many small Tenements
raised, towards <HI>Radcliffe:</HI> And <HI>Radcliffe</HI>
it self hath been also encreased in buil∣ding
Eastward (in place where I have
knowne a large high-way, with faire
Elme trees on both the sides) that the
same hath now taken hold of <HI>Lime-Hurst,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lime Hurst.</NOTE> <HI>Lime-Host,</HI> corruptly called <HI>Lime∣house,</HI>
sometime distant a mile from
<HI>Radcliffe.</HI></P>
<P>Having said thus much for building, at
<HI>Wapping, East Smithfield, Bramley,</HI> and
<HI>Shadwell,</HI> all on the South side of the
high-way to <HI>Radcliffe;</HI> now one note on
the North side also, concerning Pyrates:
I reade, that in the yeere 1440. in the
Lent season, certaine persons, with sixe
shippes brought from beyond the Seas
fish, to victuall the Citie of <HI>London;</HI>
which fish when they had delivered,
and were returning homeward, a num∣ber
of Sea-theeves in a Barge, in the
night came upon them, when they were
asleepe in their Vessels, riding at anchor
on the River <HI>Thames,</HI> and slew them, cut
their throats, east them over-boord,
tooke their money, and drowned their
ships, for that no man should espy or ac∣cuse
them. Two of these theeves were
after taken and hanged in chaines upon
a gallowes set upon a raised Hill, for the
purpose made, in the field beyond <HI>East
Smithfield,</HI> so that they might be seene
farre into the River <HI>Thames.</HI></P>
<P>The first building at <HI>Radcliffe</HI> in my
youth (not to be forgotten) was a faire
Free Schoole,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Free Schoole &amp; Almes∣houses at <HI>Radisse.</HI></NOTE> and Almes-houses, foun∣ded
by <HI>Avice Gibson,</HI> wife to <HI>Nich. Gib∣son,</HI>
Grocer, as before I have noted. But
of late yeeres, Ship-wrights, and (for
the most part) other Marine men, have
builded many large and strong houses
for themselves, and smaller for Smylers,
from thence almost to <HI>Poplar,</HI> and so to
<HI>Blacke well.</HI></P>
<P>Now for <HI>Tower hill,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tower hill</HI> without the walls.</NOTE> the plaine there is
likewise greatly diminished by Mer∣chants,
for building of small tenements:
from thence towards <HI>Ealdgate,</HI> was the
<HI>Minories,</HI> whereof I have spoken.</P>
<P>From <HI>Ealdgate</HI> East againe lieth a large
street, replenished with buildings, to
wit, on the North side the Parish
Church of Saint <HI>Buttolph,</HI> and so other
building to <HI>Hoglane,</HI> and to the barres
on both sides.</P>
<P>Also,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suburbe without <HI>Ealdgate,</HI></NOTE> without the Barres, both the
sides of the Street be pestered with
Cottages and Allies, even up to <HI>White
Chappell</HI> Church; and almost halfe a
mile beyond it, into the common field:
all which ought to lye open and free for
all men. But this common field (I say)
being sometime the beauty of this Citie
on that part, is so incroched upon, by
building of filthie Cottages, and with
other Purprestures, Inclosures, and Lay∣stalls,
that (notwithstanding all Procla∣mations
and Acts of Parliament made
to the contrarie) in some places it scarce
remaineth a sufficient high-way for the
meeting of Cariages and Droves of
Cattell, much lesse is there any faire,
pleasant, or wholesome way, for people
to walke on foot: which is no small ble∣mish
to so famous a Citie, to have so un∣savourie
and unseemely an entrie or pas∣sage
thereunto.</P>
<P>Now of <HI>White Chappell</HI> Church some∣what
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of white Chappell.</NOTE> and then back againe to <HI>Ealdgate.</HI></P>
<P>This Church is as it were a Chappell
of ease to the Parish of <HI>Stebunhith,</HI>
and the Parson of <HI>Stebunhith</HI> hath the
Gift thereof: which being first dedica∣ted
to the name of God, and the Blessed
Virgin, is now called Saint <HI>Mary Mat∣fellon,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. Mary Matfellon.</NOTE> About the yeere 1428. in the sixt
of King <HI>henry</HI> the sixt, a devout widow
of that Parish had long time cherished
and brought up, of Almes, a certaine
<HI>Frenchman,</HI> or <HI>Briton</HI> borne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A devout widow murdered.</NOTE> which most
unkindly and cruelly in a night murthe∣red
the said widow sleeping in her bed,
and after fled with such Iewels and o∣ther
stuffe of hers, as he might carsie.
But he was so freshly pursved; that (for
feare) he tooke the Church of Saint
<HI>George</HI> in <HI>Southwarke,</HI> and challenged
Priviledge of Sanctuarie there, and so
abjured the Kings Land. Then the Con∣stables
(having charge of him) brought
him into <HI>London,</HI> intending to have con∣veyed
him Eastward: but so soone as he
was come into the Parish, where before
he had committed the Murther; the
<PB N="470" REF="246"/>
wives cast upon him so must filth and
ordure of the streete, that (notwithstan∣ding
the best resistance made by the
Constables) they slew him out of hand:
And for this feat it hath beene said, that
Parish to have purchased that name of
Saint <HI>Mary Matfellon;</HI> but I finde in Re∣cord,
the same to be called <HI>Villa beatae
Mariae de Matfellon,</HI> in the 21. of <HI>Richard</HI>
the second.</P>
<P>More, we reade, that in the yeere
1336. the 10. of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, the
Bishop of <HI>Alba,</HI> Cardinall and Parson of
<HI>Stebunhith,</HI> Procurator generall in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
presented a Clerke to be Parson in
the Church of blessed <HI>Mary,</HI> called <HI>Mat∣fellon,</HI>
without <HI>Ealdgate</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now againe from <HI>Ealdgate</HI> North∣west
to <HI>Bishopsgate,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Suburb without <HI>Bishopsgate.</HI></NOTE> lyeth <HI>Hounds-ditch,</HI>
and so to <HI>Bishopsgate.</HI></P>
<P>North and by East from <HI>Bishopsgate,</HI>
lyeth a large street, or high-way, having
on the West side thereof, the Parish
Church of S. <HI>Buttolph.</HI></P>
<P>Then is the Hospitall of S. <HI>Mary</HI> of
<HI>Bethelem,</HI> founded by a Citizen of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
and as before is shewed, up to the
Barres,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Norton fall gate.</NOTE> without the which, is <HI>Norton fall

dissolved Priorie of S. <HI>Iohn Baptist,</HI> cal∣led
<HI>Holywell,</HI> a House of Nunnes, of old
time founded by a Bishop of <HI>London.
Stephen Gravesend,</HI> Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> a∣bout
the yeere 1318. was a Benefactor
thereunto, reedified by Sir <HI>Thomas Lo∣vel,</HI>
Knight of the Garter, who builded
much there, in the reignes of <HI>Henry</HI> the
seventh, and of <HI>Henry</HI> the eight. Hee en∣dowed
this House with faire Lands, and
was there buried in a large Chappell by
him builded for that purpose. This
Priorie was ualued, at the suppression,
to have of Lands two hundred ninetie
three pound by yeere, and was surren∣dred
1539. the one &amp; thirtieth of <HI>Henry</HI>
the eight. The Church thereof being
pulled downe, many houses have beene
build<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d for the Lodgings of Noblemen,
of Strangers borne, and other.</P>
<P>From <HI>Holywell,</HI> in the high Street, is
a continuall building of Tenements to
<HI>Sewers ditch,</HI> having one small side of a
field already made a Garden Plot. Ouer-against

<P>On the left hand is <HI>Ealdestreet,</HI> which
reacheth West to a stone Crosse, over-against

<P>On the right hand beyond <HI>Shores-ditch</HI>
Church, toward <HI>Hackney,</HI> are some
late builded houses upon the common
soile, for it was Lay-stall, but those
houses belong to the Parish of <HI>Stebun∣hith.</HI></P>
<P>On the other side of the high-way,
from <HI>Bishopsgate</HI> and <HI>Hounds-ditch,</HI> is the
the Dolphin, a common Inne for receipt

the L. <HI>Iohn Powlet,</HI> afterward called <HI>Fi∣shers-Folly,</HI>
and so up to the West end of
<HI>Berwardes Lane,</HI> is a continuall building

called Saint <HI>Mary Spittle,</HI> hard within

<P>From the which Bars towards <HI>Shores-ditch</HI>
on that side,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Shores-ditch</HI> so called more than 400. yeeres since, as I can prove by record.</NOTE> was all along, a conti∣nuall
building of small and base Tene∣ments,
for the most part lately erected.</P>
<P>Amongst the which (I meane of the

proper small houses, with Gardens for
poore decayed people, there placed by
the Prior of the said Hospitall:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Almes-houses in <HI>Shores-ditch.</HI></NOTE> every
one Tenant whereof payd one pennie
rent by the yeere at Christmas, and di∣ned

But after the suppression of the Hospi∣tall,
these houses for want of reparations

for he made his bargaines so hard∣ly

<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Finsbery fields</HI> and <HI>More-fields</HI> an unpro∣fitable ground.</NOTE> continued a waste and unprofita∣ble
ground a long time, so that the
same was all letten for foure markes
the yeare, in the raigne of <HI>Edward</HI> the
second. But in the yeare 1415. the third
of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, <HI>Thomas Fawconer,</HI>
Maior, as I have shewed, caused the
wall of the City to bee broken toward
the said <HI>Moore,</HI> and builded the Posterne
called <HI>Mooregate,</HI> for ease of the Citi∣zens
to walke that way upon Causies
towards <HI>Iseldon</HI> and <HI>Hoxton.</HI> Moreo∣ver,
hee caused the Ditches of the Ci∣tie,
and other the Ditches from <HI>Shores
ditch</HI> to <HI>Deepe ditch,</HI> by <HI>Bethelem</HI> into the
<HI>Moore ditch,</HI> to be newly cast and clean∣sed,
by meanes whereof the said Fenne
or <HI>Moore</HI> was greatly dreined or dryed.
But shortly after, to wit, in 1477. <HI>Ralph
Ioceline,</HI> Maior, for repairing of the
Wall of the City, caused the said <HI>Moore</HI>
to be searched for Clay &amp; Bricke to be
burnt there, &amp;c. by which meanes this
field was made the worse for a long
time.</P>
<P>In the yeere 1498. all the Gardens
which had continued time out of mind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gardens without <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>regate,</HI> destroyed and made plaine ground Ditches cast to drein the the <HI>More-field.</HI></NOTE>
without <HI>Mooregate,</HI> to wit, about and be∣yong
the Lordship of <HI>Finsbury,</HI> were
destroyed; And of them was made a
plaine field for Archers to shoote in.
And in the yeere 1512. <HI>Roger Atchley,</HI>
Maior, caused divers dikes to be cast,
and made to drein the waters of the said
<HI>Moorefields,</HI> with Bridges arched over
them, and the grounds about to be leve∣led,
whereby the said field was made
somewhat more commodious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sluce to convey the stan∣ding wa∣ter out of the <HI>Moore.</HI></NOTE> but yet it
stood full of noisome waters. Where∣upon,
in the yeere 1527. Sir <HI>Thomas Sey∣uor,</HI>
Maior, caused divers Sluces to be
made to convey the said waters over the
Towne Ditch, into the course of <HI>Wal∣brooke,</HI>
and so into the <HI>Thames:</HI> and by
these degrees was this Fenne or <HI>Moore</HI> at
length made maine and hard ground,
which before being overgrowne with
Flagges, Sedges and Rushes, served to
no use, Since the which time also, the
farther grounds beyond <HI>Finsbury Court,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Moorefields</HI> raised and wind-Mils set there∣on.</NOTE>
have beene so everheightned with
Laystalls of dung, that now divers
Wind-mills are thereon set, the Ditches
be filled up, and the Bridges ouer-whel∣med.</P>
<P>And now concerning the inclosures
of common grounds about this City,
whereof I mind not much to argue; <HI>Ed∣ward
Hall</HI> setteth downe a note of his
time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Edward Hall.</NOTE> to wit, in the fift or rather 6. of
<HI>H.</HI> the 8.</P>
<P>Before this time <HI>(saith he)</HI> the Inhabi∣tants
of the Townes about <HI>London,</HI> as <HI>Isel∣done,
Hoxton, Shores-ditch</HI> and others,
had so inclosed the cōmon fields with hedges,
and ditches, that neither the young men of
the City might shoot, nor the ancient persons
walke for their pleasures in those fields; but
that either their bowes and arrowes were
taken away or broken, or the honest persons
arrested or indighted, saying: That no Londo∣ner
ought to goe out of the City, but in the
High-wayes.</P>
<P>This saying so grieved the Londoners,
that suddainly this yeere, a great number of
the City assembled themselves in a mor∣ning,
and a Turner in a fooles coate came
crying thorow the City, shovels and spades,
shovels and spades. So many of the people fol∣lowed,
that it was wonder to behold; and
(within a short space) all the hedges about
the City were cast downe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hedges pulled downe &amp; ditches fil∣led up.</NOTE> and the ditches
filled up, and every thing made plaine; such
was the diligence of those worke-men.</P>
<P>The Kings Councell hearing of this assem∣bly,
came to the <HI>Gray Fryers,</HI> and sent for
the Maior and Councell of the Citie, to know
the cause, who declared to them the injurie
&amp; annoying done to the Citizens, &amp; to their
Liberties, which though they would not seeke
disorderly to redresse, yet the Communalty
and young persons could not be stayed thus to
remedy the same. When the Kings Councell
<PB N="476" REF="249"/>
had heard their answere, they dissimuled
the matter, and commanded the Maior to
see that no other thing were attempted, but
that they should forth-with call home the
younger sort: who having speedily atchie∣ved
their desire, returned home before the
Kings Councell, and the Maior departed
without more harme: after which time
(sayth <HI>Hall)</HI> those fields were never

<P>But afterward wee saw the thing in
worse case than ever,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Banque∣ting hou∣ses like Banque∣routs, bea∣ring great shew and little worth.</NOTE> by meanes of in∣closure

many faire Summer houses, and as
in other places of the suburbes, some of
them like Midsummer Pageants, with
Towers, Turrets, and Chimney tops,
not so much for use or profit, as for
shew and pleasure, and bewraying the
vanity of mens mindes, much unlike to
the disposition of the ancient Citizens,
who delighted in the building of Hos∣pitals,

and therein both imployed their wits,
and spent their wealths in preferment
of the common commoditie of this

<P>But now to come backe againe to
<HI>Moregate,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Suburbe without <HI>Cripplegate.</HI></NOTE> and from thence West
through a narrow passage, called the
Posterne, because it hath at either end a

the <HI>More-ditch</HI> inclosed with
Brick for Tenteryardes, and the Gar∣dens
of the said <HI>Morefield,</HI> to <HI>Morelane:</HI>
a part of the Suburbe without <HI>Cripple∣gate,</HI>
without this posterne called <HI>Crip∣plegate,</HI>
also lay a part of the said <HI>More,</HI>
even to the River of <HI>Wels,</HI> as in an other
place I have shewed, and no houses
were there builded, till the latter end
of the raigne of <HI>William</HI> the Conque∣ror,
and his Sonne <HI>William Rufus,</HI> about
which times, some few houses were
there builded along East and West,
thwart before the said Gate. One <HI>Alfune</HI>
builded for the inhabitants a Parish
Church which is of S. <HI>Giles,</HI> somewhat
West from the said Gate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parish Church of S. <HI>Giles.</HI></NOTE> and is now
on the banke of the Towne ditch, and
so was there a street since called <HI>Fore∣street,</HI>
as standing before the Gate.</P>
<P>This <HI>Alfune</HI> in the raigne of <HI>Henry</HI>
the first, became the first Hospiteler of
Saint <HI>Bartholomewes</HI> Hospitall in <HI>Smith∣field,</HI>
as in another place I have noted.
And this Parish Church of S. <HI>Giles,</HI> be∣ing
at the first a small thing, stood in
place where now standeth the Vicarage
house, but hath beene since (at divers
times) much enlarged, according as
the Parish hath increased, &amp; was at the
length newly builded in place where
now it standeth. But the same new
Church being large, strongly builded,
&amp; richly furnished with Ornamēts, was
in the yeere 1545. by casualty of fire
sore burnt and consumed: not withstan∣ding,
it was againe (within short space
of time) repaired as now it sheweth.</P>
<P>Some little distance from the East
end of this Church, standeth a faire
Conduit castellated in <HI>Forestreet.</HI> Then
had yee a Bosse of sweet water in the
wall of the Church-yard, lately made a
Pumpe, but already decayed.</P>
<P>Then had yee a faire Poole of sweet
water neare to the Church of S. <HI>Giles,</HI>
wherein <HI>Anne</HI> of <HI>Lodbery</HI> was drowned
as I have before declared.</P>
<P>In the East end of <HI>Forestreet</HI> is <HI>More
lane:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Grub street.</NOTE> then next is <HI>Grub street,</HI> of late
yeares inhabited (for the most part) by
Bowyers, Fletchers, Bow-string makers
and such like, now little occupied; Ar∣chery
giving place to a number of bow∣ling
Allies, and Dicing houses, which
in all places are increased, and too much
frequented.</P>
<P>This street stretcheth North <HI>Everades

a stranger borne, Lord of the Towne
of <HI>Manny</HI> in the Diocesse of <HI>Cambrey,</HI>
beyond the Seas, who for service done
to King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, was made
Knight of the Garter.</P>
<P>This house he founded upon this oc∣casion:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charter-house.</NOTE> A great Pestilence entring this
Iland, began first in <HI>Dorsetshire,</HI> then
proceeded into <HI>Devonshire, Somerset∣shire,
Glocestershire,</HI> and <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> and
at length came to <HI>London,</HI> and over∣spread
all <HI>England,</HI> so wasting the peo∣ple,
that scarce the tenth person of all
sorts was left alive, and Church-yards
were not sufficient to receive the dead,
but men were forced to chuse out cer∣taine
fields for burials: whereupon
<HI>Ralph Stratford,</HI> Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> in the
yeere 1348. bought a piece of ground,
called <HI>No mans land,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">No mans land.</NOTE> which he inclosed
with a wall of Bricke, and dedicated
for buriall of the dead, builded there∣upon
a proper Chappell, which is now
enlarged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pardon Church-yard <HI>by the</HI> Char∣ter-house.</NOTE> and made a dwelling house:
and this burying plot is become a faire
Garden, retaining the old name of <HI>Par∣don
Church-yard.</HI></P>
<P>About this time, in the yeere 1349.
the said Sir <HI>Walter Manny,</HI> in respect of
danger that might befall in this time of
so great a plague and infection, purcha∣sed
13. Acres and a Rod of ground,
adjoyning to the said <HI>Nomans land,</HI> and
lying in a place called <HI>Spittle Croft,</HI> be∣cause
it belonged to Saint <HI>Bartholomews
Hospitall,</HI> since that called the <HI>New
Church Haw,</HI> and caused it to bee conse∣crated
by the said Bishop of <HI>London</HI> to
the use of burials.</P>
<P><PB N="478" REF="250"/>
In this plot of ground, there was (in
that yeere) more than 50000. persons
buried, as I have read in the Charters
of <HI>Edward</HI> the third.</P>
<P>Also I have seene and read an In∣scription
fixed on a stone Crosse, some∣time
standing in the same Church-yard
and having these words:</P>
<P>Anno Domini, 1349. Regnante magna
pestilentia, consecratum fuit hoc Coemite∣rium,
in quo &amp; infra septa praesentis Mo∣nasterii,
sepulta fuerunt mortuorum cor∣pora,
plusquam quinquaginta millia, prae∣ter
alia multa abhinc usque ad praesens,
quorum animabus propitietur Deus, A∣men.</P>
<P>In consideration of the number of
Christian people here buried, the said
Sir <HI>Walter Manny</HI> caused first a Chap∣pell
to be builded, where (for the space
of twenty three yeares) offerings were
made: and it is to be noted, that above
100000. bodies of Christian people
had in that Church-yard beene buried,
for the said Knight had purchased that
place for the buriall of poore people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bull of Pope <HI>Cle∣ment.</HI></NOTE>
Travailers, and other that were disea∣sed,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charter-house.</NOTE> to remaine for ever; whereupon,
an order was taken, for the avoyding
of contention betweene the Parsons of
Churches and that house,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Churchyard</HI> prepared of the poore of poore, so to re∣maine for ever.</NOTE> to wit, that
the bodies should bee had unto the
Church where they were Parishioners,
or dyed, and after the funerall service
done, had to the place where they
should be buried.</P>
<P>And the yeere 1371. he caused there
to bee founded an house of <HI>Carthusian</HI>
Monkes, which he willed to be called
the <HI>Salutation,</HI> and that one of the
Monkes should be called Prior, and he
gave them the sayd place of 13. Acres
and a Rod of land, with the Chappel,
and houses there builded for their ha∣bitation.
He also gave them the three
Acres of land, lying without the wals
on the North part, betwixt the lands
of the Abbot of <HI>Westminster,</HI> and the
lands of the Prior of Saint <HI>Iohn;</HI> which
three Acres being purchased, inclosed,
and dedicated by <HI>Ralph Stratford,</HI> Bi∣shop
of <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vse for the Fryery Cart.</NOTE> as is aforeshewed, re∣mained

of such as desperately ended their

who were fetched thither usually in a

with blacke, having a plaine white
crosse thwarting, and at the fore-end
a S. <HI>Iohns</HI> Crosse without, and within a
Bell ringing by shaking of the Cart,
wherby the same might be heard when
it passed, &amp; this was called the Fryery
Cart, which belonged to S. <HI>Iohns,</HI> and
had the priviledge of Sanctuary.</P>

<P>Here now I find fit time, to commend

<HI>Charter-house,</HI> by West <HI>Smithfield,</HI>
belonging then to the Right Honorable
<HI>Thomas</HI> Earle of <HI>Suffolke,</HI> after Lord

of Lands and Tenements ther∣to
belonging, and very aptly seated
for wholesome ayre, and many other
commodities. All which commodious∣nesse
of situation, and largenesse of cir∣cuit,
gave occasion to this well-minded
Gentleman Master <HI>Sutton,</HI> to affect that
house, as the onely place, whereon to
<PB N="479" REF="250"/>
build the foundation of his Religious
purpose. For, among other his Chri∣stian
determinations, hee had former∣ly
intended to build an house at <HI>Hal∣lingbury
Bouchers</HI> in <HI>Essex,</HI> to be an Hos∣pitall
for such poore men and Children
as he himselfe (in his life time, or fu∣ture
Governors for the same to bee de∣puted)
should thinke fit to bee lodged
and relieved there: Also, for a Schoole-master
and Vsher,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His first purpose at <HI>Hallingbu∣rie</HI> in <HI>Es∣sex</HI></NOTE> to teach Children
to reade and write, and instruct them
in the Latine and Greeke Grammar:
with a Learned Divine likewise to
preach the Word of God to them all,
and a Master beside, to governe all
those people belonging to that house.</P>
<P>To this blessed end and purpose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How hee intended to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rme the Hos∣pitall.</NOTE> hee
had procured (by earnest suit) power
by an Act of Parliament, to build such
an Hospitall in the Towne of <HI>Halling∣bury
Bouchers,</HI> and that the same should
be named, <HI>The Hospitall of King Iames,</HI>
founded in <HI>Hallingbury</HI> in the Coun∣tie
of <HI>Essex,</HI> at the humble Petition,
and at the onely costs and charges of
<HI>Thomas Sutton,</HI> Esquire: Appointing
also such Honourable, Reverend and
Worthy persons, as by the said Act of
Parliament were nominated and ap∣pointed,
to bee the first and instant Go∣vernors
of the Lands, Possessions,
Goods and Reveneues of the said Hos∣pitall.</P>
<P>But afterward, upon more grounded
deliberation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Char∣ter house</HI> more ne∣cessary for an Hos∣pital than <HI>Hallingbury</HI></NOTE> and finding this goodly
house of the <HI>Charter-house,</HI> to bee much
more convenient for the purpose, than
that to be builded at <HI>Hallingbury</HI> could
be: hee became an earnest suiter to the
Earle of <HI>Suffolke,</HI> to purchase that
house of him, acquianting his Honor
with the alteration of his minde con∣cerning
<HI>Hallingbury,</HI> and his earnest de∣sire
to make the <HI>Charter-house</HI> his Hos∣pitall.
The Earle being honourably
enclined to so godly a motion, the mat∣ter
sustained the lesse debating between
them: but the price being concluded
on, the bargaine and sale was assured.

amounted to 13000, <ABBR>l.</ABBR> which was paid
downe in hand, before the ensealing of

<P>Beyond the Barres had ye (in old

whose order first began in the

called in the raigne of <HI>Henry</HI> the third,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New streete.</NOTE>

<P>The same streete hath since been cal∣led

<HI>Edward</HI> the third annexed the house of
Converts by Patent, to the office of <HI>Cu∣stos

in the 15. of his raigne.</P>
<P>In this streete, the first faire building

the <HI>Cursitors Office,</HI> builded with divers

late Lord Keeper of the great
Seale.</P>
<P>Neere unto this <HI>Cursitors Office,</HI> be
divers faire houses and large Gardens,
builded and made in a ground, some∣time
belonging to one great house on
the other side the street, there made by
<HI>Ralph Nevill,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Chichester.</HI> This
ground he had by the gift of <HI>Henry</HI> the

<P>The King granted to <HI>Ralph,</HI> Bishop of

<P>On the West side of <HI>Newstreete,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Blacke Fryers <HI>Church by</HI> Oldboorne.</NOTE> to∣wards

time) the Church, and house of the prea∣ching
Friers: the which house I find that
in the yeere of Christ 1221. the Fryers
Preachers, 13. in number, came into
<HI>England,</HI> and having to their Prior one
named <HI>Gilbert de Fraxineto,</HI> in company
of <HI>Peter de la Roch,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Winchester,</HI>
came to <HI>Canturburie,</HI> where presenting
themselves before the Archbishop <HI>Ste∣ven,</HI>
he commanded the said Prior to
preach, whose Sermon he liked so well,
that ever after hee loved that Order.
These Fryers came to <HI>London,</HI> and had
their first house without the Wall of
the City by <HI>Oldboorne,</HI> neere unto the
old Temple.</P>
<P><HI>Hubert de Burgo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Earle of <HI>Kent</HI> burl∣ed in the <HI>Blacke Fryers.</HI></NOTE> Earle of <HI>Kent,</HI> was a

the yeere 1242. was buried in their
Church, unto the which Church he had
given his place at <HI>Westminster,</HI> which the
said Fryers afterward sold to <HI>Walter
Gray,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Yorke,</HI> and hee left
it to his successors in that Sea, for ever
to be their house, when they should re∣paire
to the City of <HI>London.</HI> And ther∣fore
the same was called <HI>Yorke-place,</HI>
which name so continued, untill the
yeere, 1529. that King <HI>Henry</HI> the eight
tooke it from <HI>Thomas Woolsey,</HI> Cardinall
and Archbishop of <HI>Yorke,</HI> and then gave
it to name, <HI>White-Hall.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Margaret,</HI> Sister to the King of <HI>Scots,</HI>
Widdow to <HI>Geffrey,</HI> Earle Marshall,
deceased 1244. and was buried in this
Church.</P>
<P>In the yeere 1250. the Fryers of this
Order of Preachers, thorough Christen∣dome,
and from <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> were by a
Convocation assembled together, at
this their house by <HI>Old-boorne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Convoca∣tion of <HI>Blacke Fryers</HI> by <HI>Oldboorne.</HI></NOTE> to en∣treat
of their estate, to the number of
400. having meate and drinke found
them of Almes, because they had no
possessions of their owne. The first day
the King came to their Chapter, found
them meate and drinke, and dined with
them. Another day the Queene found
them meat and drinke: afterward the
Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> then the Abbot of
<HI>Westminster,</HI> of S. <HI>Albons, Waltham,</HI> and
others. In the yeere 1276. <HI>Gregory Roke∣sley,</HI>
Maior, and the Barons of <HI>London,</HI>
granted and gave to <HI>Robert Kilwarby,</HI>
Archbishop of <HI>Canturburie,</HI> two lanes or
wayes next the street of <HI>Baynards Castell,</HI>
and the Tower of <HI>Mountfichet,</HI> to be de∣stroyed.
On the which place the said <HI>Ro∣bert</HI>
builded the late new Church, with
the rest of the Stones that were left of
the said Tower. And thus the <HI>Black-Fryers</HI>
left their Church and house by
<HI>Oldboorne,</HI> and departed to their new.
<PB N="488" REF="255"/>
This old Frier-house, <HI>(juxta Holboorn</HI>
saith the Patent) was by King <HI>Edward</HI>
the first in the sixteenth of his raigne,
given to <HI>Henry Lacy,</HI> Earle of <HI>Lincolne.</HI>
Next to this house of Fryers, was one
other great House, sometime belonging
to the Bishop of <HI>Chichester,</HI> whereof <HI>Ma∣thew
Paris</HI> writeth thus:</P>
<P><HI>Ralph de nova villa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bishop of <HI>Chiche∣sters Inne.</HI></NOTE> or <HI>Nevill,</HI> Bishop

sometime builded a noble house, even
from the ground, not farre from the
New Temple and house of Converts, in
the which place he deceased, in the
yeere 1244.</P>
<P>In this place after the decease of the
said Bishop, and in place of the house of
<HI>Blacke-Fryers</HI> before spoken of, <HI>Henry

our Lady Chappell, and Saint

retaining the name of <HI>Lincolnes Inne,</HI> as

faire buildings, and replenished with
Gentlemen, studious in the Common
Lawes. In the raigne of <HI>Henry</HI> the eight
Sir <HI>Thomas Lovell</HI> was a great builder
there, especially he builded the Gate∣house
and forefront towards the East,
placing theron aswell the <HI>Lacies</HI> Armes,
as his owne. He caused the <HI>Lacies</HI>
Armes to be cast and wrought in Lead,
on the Lover of the Hall of that house,
which was in the 3. Escutcheons a Ly∣on

attended on by many great Lords, and
choise Ladies. Concerning their enter∣tainment
there, though I was no eye∣witnesse

such, as nothing should want to wel∣come
so great an expectation. And ther∣fore,
what variety of devices, pleasing

flew bountifully abroad, I will rather re∣ferre

<P>After this also, sundry devout men of

transported Wooll, should bring over,
for every Sacke, foure Nobles of Silver
Bullion.</P>
<P>In the 25. of his raigne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wooll-Staple at <HI>VV. slmin∣ster.</HI></NOTE> he appointed
the Staple of Wooll to be kept onely at
<HI>Canturbury,</HI> for the honour of S. <HI>Thomas.</HI>
But in the 27. of the same King <HI>Edward,</HI>
the Staple of Wooll, before kept at
<HI>Bruges</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> was ordained (by
Parliament) to be kept in divers places
of <HI>England, Wales,</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> as at <HI>New-Castle,
Yorke, Lincolne, Canturburie, Nor∣wich,
Westminster, Chichester, Winchester,
Excester, Bristow, Caermarden, &amp;c.</HI> to the
great benefit of the King, and losse unto
strangers &amp; Merchants. For there grew
unto the King by this meanes (as it was
said) the summe of a thousand, an hun∣dred
&amp; two pounds by the yeere, more
than any his predecessors before had re∣ceived:
The Staple at <HI>Westminster,</HI> at
that time, began on the next morrow af∣ter
the feast of S. <HI>Peter ad Vincula.</HI></P>
<P>The next yeere was granted to the
King by Parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Robert de Amesbury.</NOTE> towards the reco∣verie
of his Title in <HI>France,</HI> 50. shillings
of every Sacke of Wooll, transported
over Seas, for the space of six yeere next
ensuing: by meanes whereof, the King
might dispend dayly, during those
yeeres, more than a thousand Markes
starling: For by the common opinion,
there were more than an hundred thou∣sand
Sacks of Wooll yeerely transpor∣ted
into forraine Lands; so that during
six yeeres, the said grant extended to fif∣teen
hundred thousand pound starling.</P>
<P>In the 37. of <HI>Edward</HI> the third,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Staple at <HI>Callis</HI> let to farme.</NOTE> it was
granted unto him for two yeers, to
take sixe and twentie shillings eight
pence upon every Sack of Wooll trans∣ported:
and the same yeere, the Staple
of Wooll (notwithstanding the Kings
Oath, and other great Estates) was or∣dained
to be kept at <HI>Callis,</HI> and sixe and
twenty Merchāts, the best &amp; wealthiest
of all <HI>England,</HI> to be Farmers there, both
of the Town &amp; Staple, for three yeeres,
every Merchant to have sixe men of
Armes, and foure Archers, at the Kings
cost. He ordained there also two Mai∣ors,
one for the Towne, and one for the
Staple, and he took for <HI>Mala capta,</HI> com∣monly
called <HI>Maltorth,</HI> 20. shillings.
<PB N="497" REF="259"/>
and of the said Merchants; Guardians
of the Towne, fortie pence upon every

<P>In the 44. of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Quin∣borough,
Kingston</HI> upon <HI>Hull,</HI> and <HI>Bo∣ston,</HI>
were made Staples of Wooll:
which matter so much offended some,
that in the fifty of his raigne, in a Par∣liament
at <HI>London,</HI> it was complained,
that the Staple of Wooll was so remo∣ved
from <HI>Callis,</HI> to divers Townes in
<HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Record.</NOTE> contrarie to the Statute, ap∣pointing,
that Citizens and Merchants
should keepe it there, and that the King
might have the Profits and Customes,
with the exchāge of Gold &amp; Silver that
was there made, by all the Merchants in
Christendome (esteemed to amount to
eight thousand pound by yeere) the ex∣change
onely: And the Citizens and
Merchants so ordered the matter, that
the King spent nothing upon Souldiers;
neither upon defence of the Towne a∣gainst
the Enemies, whereas now he
spent eight thousand pound by yeere.</P>
<P>In the fifty one of <HI>Edward</HI> the third,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Manus∣cript.</NOTE>
when the Staple was setled at <HI>Callis,</HI>
the Major of the Staple did furnish the
Captaine of the Towne, upon any Rode,

without any wages.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Frenth.</NOTE></P>

<P>In the foureteenth of his raigne, there
was granted fortie shillings upon euery

built a Church to the honor of

because it was over-grown with thornes,
and environed with water) the <HI>Saxons</HI>
called <HI>Thorney,</HI> and now of the Monaste∣rie

<HI>Westminster.</HI> What further I reade, con∣cerning

now <HI>Westminster</HI> standeth, fell downe by
the violence of an Earthquake. Of the
ruines wherof, <HI>Lucius</HI> (who was King of
the <HI>Britaines,</HI> and reigned heere by per∣mission
of the <HI>Romans)</HI> built a small
Church to the honor of Christ, in the
yeere of our Lord 170. which afterward
was utterly defaced, when the heat of
persecution (under <HI>Dioclesian)</HI> wasted
<HI>Britaine.</HI></P>
<P>This place afterward (for a long time)
lay altogether neglected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King <HI>Sebert</HI> built a Mo∣nastery in the place where the Church stood.</NOTE> and not regar∣ded,
but became all overgrowne with
thornes and bushes: in so much as the

<HI>Saxons</HI> (or of <HI>Essex</HI> and <HI>Middlesex)</HI> who
was the first that subscribed to the wor∣ship
of Christ, built in that place a Mo∣nasterie
to Christ and Saint <HI>Peter,</HI> in the
yeere of Christ 605. whereupon, part∣ly
from the situation to the West, and
partly, from the Monasterie or Minster,
it began to take the name of <HI>Westminster:</HI>

<P>The Parish Church of Saint <HI>Mar∣garet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Parish Church of S. <HI>Mar∣garet.</HI></NOTE>
sometime within the Abbey,
was by <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>Confessor</HI> removed,
and builded without, for ease of the
Monks.</P>
<P>This Church continued till the dayes
of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, at what time the
Merchants of the Staple, and Parishio∣ners
of <HI>Westminster</HI> builded it all of new,
the great Chancell excepted, which
was builded by the Abbots of <HI>Westmin∣ster,</HI>
and this remaineth now a faire Pa∣rish
Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the reigne of <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth.</NOTE> though sometime in dan∣ger

<P>In the South Ile of this Church, is a
faire Marble Monument of Dame <HI>Mary

<HI>Conington,</HI> in <HI>Huntington</HI> shire, first mar∣ried
to <HI>William Coton,</HI> to whose Issue her

husband was Sir <HI>Thomas Billing,</HI> Chiefe
Iustice of <HI>England;</HI> and her last, whom
likewise she buried, was <HI>Thomas Lacy,</HI>
erecting this Monument to the memo∣rie
of her three husbands, with whose
Armes shee hath garnished it, and for
her owne buriall, wherein she was in∣terred
in the yeere 1499.</P>
<P>Next to this famous Monastery, is the
Kings principall Palace, of what Anti∣quity
it is uncertaine: but <HI>Edward</HI> the
<HI>Confessor</HI> held his Court there, as may
appeare by the testimonie of sundry; and
namely, of <HI>Ingulphus,</HI> as I have before
told you. The said King had his Palace,
and for the most remained there: where
hee also ended his life, and was buried
in the Monastery which he had builded.
It is not to be doubted, but that K. <HI>Willi∣am</HI>
the first, as he was crowned there, so
he builded much at this Palace, for he
found it farre inferiour to the building
of Princely Palaces in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>And it is manifest by the testimonie
of many Authors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Hall at <HI>VVest∣minster.</HI></NOTE> that <HI>William Rufus,</HI>
builded the great Hall there, about the
yeere of Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mathew Paris.</NOTE> 1097. Amongst others,
<HI>Roger</HI> of <HI>Windover</HI> and <HI>Mathew Paris,</HI> doe
write, that K. <HI>VVilliam</HI> (being returned
out of <HI>Normandy</HI> into <HI>England)</HI> kept his
feast of Whitsontide very royally at
<HI>Westminster</HI> in the new hall which he had
lately builded, the length whereof (say
some) was 270. foote, and seventy foure
foot in bredth. And when he heard men
say, that this Hall was too great, hee
<PB N="520" REF="272"/>
answered and said:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Liber Wood∣bridge.</NOTE> <HI>This Hall is not bigge
enough by the one halfe, and is but a Bedde-chamber,
in comparison of that I meane to
make.</HI></P>
<P>A diligent searcher (saith <HI>Mathew
Paris)</HI> might find out the foundation of
the Hall, which he had supposed to
have builded, stretching from the river
of <HI>Thames,</HI> to the common high way.</P>
<P>This Palace was repaired about the
yeere,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Palace re∣paired.</NOTE> 1163. by <HI>Thomas Becket,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">IV. Fitzsle∣pho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> Chan∣cellor
of <HI>England,</HI> with exceeding great
celerity and speed, which before was
ready to have fallen downe. This hath
been the pricipall seate and Palace of
all the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> since the Con∣quest:
for here have they in the great
Hall kept their Feasts, of Coronation
especially, and other solemne Feasts as
at Christmas and such like most com∣monly.
For proofe whereof, I find recor∣ded,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Record Tow.</NOTE> that in the yeere, 1236. and the
twentieth of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, on the 29.
of December, <HI>William de Haverhull,</HI> the
Kings Treasurer, was commanded, that
upon the day of the Circumcision of our
Lord, he should cause 6000. poore
people to be fed at <HI>Westminster,</HI> for the
state of the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The use of the great Hall was to feed the poore.</NOTE> the Queene, and their
children. The weake and aged to bee
placed in the great Hall, and in the les∣ser
those were more strong and in rea∣sonable
plight: In the Kings Chamber
the children, and in the Queeues: and
when the King knew the charge, hee
gladly allowed it in the accounts.</P>
<P>In the yeere 1238. the same King
<HI>Henry</HI> kept his Feast of Christmas at
<HI>Westminster</HI> in the great Hall,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mathew Paris</HI> great feasts in <HI>VVestmi∣ster</HI> Hall.</NOTE> so did hee
in the yeere 1241. where he placed the
Legate in the most honorable place of
the table; to wit, in the middest, which
the Noblemen tooke in evill part.</P>
<P>The King sate on the right hand, and
the Archbishop on the left, and then all
the Prelates and Nobles, according to
their estates: for the King himselfe did
set the guests.</P>
<P>The yeere 1242. hee likewise kept his
Christmas in the Hall, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Also, in the yeere 1243. <HI>Richard,</HI>
Earle of <HI>Cornewall,</HI> the Kings brother,
married <HI>Cincia,</HI> daughter to <HI>Beatrice,</HI>
Countesse of <HI>Provence,</HI> &amp; kept his mar∣riage
Feast in the great Hall at <HI>Westmin∣ster,</HI>
with great royalty and company of
Noble men: in so much, that there were
told <HI>(triginta millia)</HI> 30000. dishes of
meats at that dinner.</P>
<P>In the yeere 1256. King <HI>Henry</HI> sate in
the Exchequer of this Hall,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Henry</HI> the 3. sate in the Exche∣quer, and amerced the She∣riffes.</NOTE> and there
set downe order for the appearance of
Sheriffes, and bringing in of their ac∣counts:
there was 5. Marks set on every
Sheriffes head for a fine, because they
had not distrained every person, that
might dispend 15. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> land by the yeere,
to receive the order of Knighthood, ac∣cording
as the same Sheriffes were com∣manded.</P>
<P>Also, the Maior, Aldermen and She∣riffes
of <HI>London,</HI> being accused of oppres∣sion
&amp; wrongs done by them, and sub∣mitting
themselves in this place before
the King, sitting then in judgment upon
that matter; they were condemned to
pay their fines for their offences com∣mitted,
and further, every one of them
discharged of assise and ward.</P>
<P>In the yeeres 1268. and 1269. the
same King kept his Christmas Feasts at
<HI>Westminster,</HI> as before: and also in the
same yeere 1269. he translated (with
great solemnitie) the body of King <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>
the Confessor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Translatiō of <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>Con∣fessor,</HI></NOTE> into a new Chap∣pell,
at the back of the high Altar: which
Chappell he had prepared of a marvai∣lous
workemanship, bestowing a new
Tombe or Shrine of gold.</P>
<P>And on the day of his translation, he
kept a Royall Feast in the great Hall of
the Palace: Thus much for the Feasts of
old time in this Hall.</P>
<P>We read also,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marshes about <HI>VVool∣witch</HI> drowned.</NOTE> that in the yeere, 1236.
the River of <HI>Thames</HI> overflowing the
bankes, caused the Marshes about <HI>Wool∣witch</HI>
to bee all on a Sea, wherein Boats
and other Vessels were carried with the
streame, so that besides cattell, the grea∣test
number of men, women &amp; children,
Inhabitants there, were drowned.</P>
<P>In the great Palace of <HI>Westminster,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wherries rowed in <HI>VVestmin∣ster</HI> Hall.</NOTE> men
did row with Wherries in the middest
of the Hall, being forced to ride to their
chambers.</P>
<P>Moreover, in the yeere 1242. the
<HI>Thames</HI> overflowing the bankes about
<HI>Lambith,</HI> drowned houses and fields, by
the space of 6. miles, so that in the great
Hall at <HI>Westminster,</HI> men tooke their
horses, because the water ran over all.</P>
<P>This Palace was (in the yeere 1299.
<PB N="521" REF="272"/>
the 27. of <HI>Edward</HI> the first) burnt by a
vehement fire,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>T. Walsingh.</HI> Palace at <HI>Westminster</HI> burne.</NOTE> kindled in the lesser Hall
of the Kings house, the same with ma∣ny
other houses adjoining, and with the
Queenes Chamber, were consumed,
but after that repaired.</P>
<P>In the yeere, 1313. the 31. of <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>
the first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kings treasury at <HI>Westminster</HI> robbed.</NOTE> the Kings treasurie at
<HI>Westminster</HI> was robbed, for the which

throwne into the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> and
indighted of the robbery of an hundred
thousand pound: but they affirming
themselves to be cleare of the fact, and
desiring the King of speedy justice, a
Commission was directed for inquiry
of the truth, and they were freed.</P>
<P>In the yeere 1316. <HI>Edward</HI> the se∣cond
did solemnize his Feast of Pente∣cost
at <HI>Westminster,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Edward</HI> the 2. kee∣ping his feasts at <HI>Westminster</HI> hall, was presented with a complaint of not re∣warding Souldiers.</NOTE> in the great Hall,
where sitting Royally at the table, with
his Peeres about him, there entred a
woman adorned like a Minstrell, sitting
on a great horse, trapped as Minstrels
then used, who rode round about the
tables, shewing pastime, and at length
came up to the Kings table, and layd be∣fore
him a Letter, and forthwith turning
her horse, saluted every one, and depar∣ted.
The Letter being opened, had these
contents.</P>
<P>Our Soveraigne Lord the King, hath no∣thing
courteously respected his Knights, that
in his Fathers time, and also in his owne
have put forth their persons to divers perils,
and have utterly lost, or greatly diminished
their substance, for honor of the said King,
and he hath inriched abundantly such as
have not borne the weight (as yet) of the
businesse, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This great Hall was begunne to be re∣paired
in the yeere 1397. by <HI>Richard</HI> the
second,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great Hall at <HI>Westmin∣ster</HI> repai∣red.</NOTE> who caused the wals, windowes
and roofe, to be taken downe, and new
made, with a stately porch, and divers
lodgings of a marvailous worke, and
with great costs. All which hee levied
of Strangers banished, or flying out of
their Countries, who obtained licence
to remaine in this Land by the Kings
Charters, which they had purchased
with great summes of money, <HI>Iohn Bo∣terell</HI>
being then Clarke of the works.</P>
<P>This Hall being finished in the yeere
1399. the same King kept a most roy∣all
Christmas there, with daily Iu∣stings,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great feasts at <HI>Westminster</HI> Hall.</NOTE> and runnings at Tilt, where∣unto
resorted such a number of people,
that there was every day spent twenty
eight, or twenty sixe Oxen, and three
hundred sheepe, beside fowle without
number.</P>
<P>He caused a Gowne for himselfe to
bee made of Gold,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ro. Iuelefe.</NOTE> garnished with
Pearle and precious Stones, to the va∣lue
of three thousand Markes. He was
garded by <HI>Cheshire-men,</HI> and had about
him commonly thirteene Bishops, be∣sides
Barons, Knights, Esquires, and
other more than needed: in so much,
that to the household came every day to
meate, ten thousand people; as appea∣reth
by the messes told out from the
Kitchin to three hundred Servitors.</P>
<P>Thus was this great Hall, for the ho∣nour
of the Prince, oftentimes furnished
with ghests, not onely in this Kings time
(a prodigall Prince) but in the time
of other also, both before and since,
though not so usaully noted. For when
it is said, the King held his Feast of
Christmas, or such a Feast at <HI>Westmin∣ster;</HI>
it may well bee supposed to bee
kept in this great Hall, as most sufficient
to such a purpose.</P>
<P>I find noted by <HI>Robert Fabian</HI> (some∣time
an Alderman of <HI>London)</HI> that King
<HI>Henry</HI> the seventh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ro. Fabian.</NOTE> in the ninth of his
reigne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King <HI>Henry</HI> the 7. fea∣sted the Maior of <HI>London,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> (holding his Royall Feast of
Christmas at <HI>Westminster)</HI> on the twelfth
day, feasted <HI>Ralph Austry,</HI> then Maior of
<HI>London,</HI> and his brethren the Aldermen,
with other Commoners in great num∣ber,
and after dinner, dubbed the Mai∣or,
Knight, caused him with his bre∣thren,
to stay and behold the disguisings
and other disports in the night follow∣ing
shewed in the great Hall, which
was richly hanged with Atras, and sta∣ged
about on both sides. Which dis∣ports
being ended, in the morning, the
King, the Queene, the Ambassadors,
and other Estates, being set at a table of
stone, 60. Knights and Esquires served
60. dishes to the Kings Messe, and as
many to the Queenes (neigher flesh nor
fish) &amp; served the Maior with 24. dishes
to his Messe, of the same manner, with
sundry wines in most plenteous wife.</P>
<P>And finally, the King and Queene
being conveyed with great lights into
<PB N="522" REF="273"/>
the Palace; the Maior with his Compa∣ny
in Barges, returned and came to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
by breake of the next day. Thus
much for building of this great Hall,
and feasting therein.</P>
<P>It moreover appeareth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parlia∣ments kept in <HI>VVestmin∣ster</HI> Hall.</NOTE> that many
Parliaments have been kept there: for I
find noted, that in the yeere 1397. the
great Hall at <HI>Westminster,</HI> being out of
reparations; and therefore, as it were,
new builded by <HI>Richard</HI> the second (as is
afore shewed) the same <HI>Richard</HI> in the
meane time having occasion to hold a
Parliament, caused (for that purpose) a
large house to be builded in the middest
of the Palace Court, betwixt the clocke-Tower,
and the gate of the old great
Hall.</P>
<P>This house was very large and long,
made of Timber, covered with Tyle,
open on both the sides, and at both the
ends, that all men might see and heare
what was both said and done.</P>
<P>The Kings Archers (in number 4000.
<HI>Cheshire</HI> men) compassed the house a∣bout
with their bowes bent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I find of Record the 50. of <HI>Ed.</HI> the 3. that the Chapter-house of the Abbot of <HI>VVestm.</HI> was then the usuall house for the Com∣mons in Parliamēt. Bouch of Court.</NOTE> and Ar∣rowes
nocked in their hands, alwayes
ready to shoote: they had Bouch of
Court (to wit, meate and drinke) and
great wages, of six pence by the day.</P>
<P>The old great Hall being new buil∣ded,
Parliaments were againe there
kept as before: namely, one in the yeere
1399. for the deposing of <HI>Richard</HI> the
second. A great part of this Palace at
<HI>Westminster</HI> was once againe burnt in the
yeere, 1512. the fourth of <HI>Henry</HI> the
eight; since the which time, it hath not
beene reedified: onely the great Hall,
with the offices neere adjoining, are
kept in good reparations, and serveth as
afore, for Feasts at Coronations, Ar∣raignements
of great persons charged
with treasons, keeping of the Courts of
Iustice, &amp;c. But the Princes have beene
lodged in other places about the City,
as at <HI>Baynards-Castell,</HI> at <HI>Bridewell,</HI> and
<HI>White-hall,</HI> sometime called <HI>Yorke place,</HI>
and sometime at S. <HI>Iames.</HI></P>
<P>This great Hall hath beene the usuall
place of pleadings, and ministration of
Iustice, whereof some what shortly I
will note.</P>
<P>In times past,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Magna Charta.</NOTE> the Courts &amp; Benches
followed the King, wheresoever hee
went, as well since the Conquest, as
before, which thing at length being
thought cumbersome, painefull, and
chargeable to the people; it was in the
yeere 1224. the 9. of <HI>Henry</HI> the third a∣greed,
that there should be a standing
place appointed, where matters should
be heard and judged, which was in the
great Hall at <HI>Westminster.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Common pleas in <HI>VVestmin∣ster</HI> Hall. <HI>T. Smith.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>In this Hall he ordained three judge∣ment
seates, to wit, at the entry on the
right hand, the Common Pleas, where
civill matters are to bee pleaded, speci∣ally
such as touch Lands or contracts. At
the upper end of the Hall, on the right
hand, or South East corner, the <HI>Kings
Bench,</HI> where Pleas of the Crowne have
their hearing:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Court of the Chan∣cerie.</NOTE> And on the left hand or
Southwest corner, sitteth the Lord
Chancellor, accompanied with the Ma∣ster
of the Rolls, and other men, learned
for the most part in the Civill law, and
called Masters of the Chancery, which
have the Kings fee.</P>
<P>The times of pleading in these
Courts are foure in the yeere, which
are called Tearmes.</P>
<P>The first is <HI>Hilarie Tearme,</HI> which
beginneth the three and twentieth of
Ianuary, if it be not Sunday, and endeth
the twelfth of February.</P>
<P>The second is <HI>Easter Tearme,</HI> and be∣ginneth
seventeene dayes after Easter∣day,
and endeth foure dayes after As∣cension
day.</P>
<P>The third Tearme beginneth six or
seven dayes after <HI>Trinitie</HI> Sunday, and
endeth the Wednesday fortnight af∣ter.</P>
<P>The fourth is <HI>Michaelmas Tearme,</HI>
which beginneth the ninth of October,
if it be not Sunday, and endeth the 28.
of November.</P>
<P>And heere is to bee noted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kings of this Realme have sate on the <HI>Kings Bench</HI> in <HI>VVest∣minster</HI> Hall.</NOTE> that the
Kings of this Realme have used some∣times
to sit in person in the <HI>Kings Bench:</HI>
namely, King <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, in the
yeere, 1462. in <HI>Michaelmas Tearme,</HI> sate
in the <HI>Kings Bench</HI> three dayes together,
in the open Court, to understand how
his lawes were ministred and executed.</P>
<P>Within the Port, or entry into the
Hall, on either side are ascendings up
into large Chambers, without the Hall
adjoining thereunto, wherein certaine
Courts be kept,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Court of the Exche∣quer.</NOTE> namely, on the right
hand, is the Court of the Exchequer, a
<PB N="523" REF="273"/>
place of account, for the revenewes of
the Crowne: the hearers of the account
have Auditors under them; but they
which are the chiefe for accounts of the
Prince, are called Barons of the Exche∣quer,
whereof one is called the <HI>Chiefe Ba∣ron.</HI>
The greatest officer of all, is called
the High Treasurer. In this Court be
heard those that are delators,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Infor∣mers.</NOTE> or infor∣mers,
in popular and penall actions, ha∣ving
thereby part of the profit by the
law assigned unto them.</P>
<P>In this Court, if any question bee,
it is determined after the order of the
Common Law of <HI>England</HI> by twelve
men, and all Subsidies, Taxes and Cu∣stomes,
by account: for in this office, the
Sheriffes of the Shire doe attend upon
the execution of the commandements
of the Iudges, which the Earle should
do, if he were not attending upon the
Prince in the warres, or otherwise a∣bout
him. For, the Chiefe Office of the
Earle was, to see the Kings Iustice to
have course, and to bee well executed
in the Shire, and the Princes Revenewes
to bee well answered, and brought into
the Treasurie.</P>
<P>If any Fines or Amerciaments bee
extracted out of any of the said Courts
upon any man, or any Arrerages of ac∣counts
of such things as is of Customes,
Taxes, and Subsidies, or other such like
occasions; the same the Sheriffe of the
Shire doth gather, and is answerable
therefore in the Exchequer.</P>
<P>As for other ordinary Rents of Patri∣moniall
Lands, and most commonly of
Taxes, Customes and Subsidies, there
be particular Receivers and Collectors,
which doe answere it into the Exche∣quer.</P>
<P>This Court of the Exchequer hath of
old time, and as I thinke, since the Con∣quest,
beene kept at <HI>Westminster,</HI> not∣withstanding,
sometimes remooved
thence by commandement of the King,
and after restored againe; as namely, in
the yeere, one thousand two hundred
and nine, King <HI>Iohn</HI> commanded the
Exchequer to bee remooved from <HI>West-minster</HI>
to <HI>Northhampton,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>On the left hand above the staire, is
the Dutchie Chamber,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dutchy court.</NOTE> wherein is kept
the Court for the Dutchie of <HI>Lancaster,</HI>
by a Chancellor of that Dutchie, and o∣ther
ther Officers under him.</P>
<P>Then is there in another Chamber,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Office of Receit.</NOTE>
the Office of the receits of the Queenes
Revenewes for the Crowne.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Starre Chamber.</NOTE></P>
<P>Then is there also the <HI>Starre-Cham∣ber,</HI>
where, in the Tearme time, every
weeke once at the least, which is com∣monly
on Fridaies and Wednesdaies,
and on the next day after the Tearme
endeth, the Lord Chancellor and the
Lords, and other of the Privie-Coun∣cell,
and the chiefe Iustices of <HI>England,</HI>
from Nine of the Clocke, till it bee
Eleven, doe sit.</P>
<P>This place is called the <HI>Starre-Cham∣ber,</HI>
because the Roofe thereof is decked
with the likenesse of Starres gilt: there
be plaints heard, of Ryots, Rowts, and
other misdemeanours, which if they be
found by the Kings Councell, the party
offender shall be censured by these per∣sons,
which speake one after another,
and he shall bee both fined and com∣manded
to prison.</P>
<P>Then at the upper end of the great
Hall by the <HI>Kings Bench,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The court of Wards and Live∣ries.</NOTE> is a going up
to a great Chamber, called the <HI>White-Hall,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Court of Requests. S. <HI>Stephens</HI> Chappell.</NOTE> wherein is now kept the Court of
Wards and Liveries, and adjoining
thereunto is the Court of Requests.</P>
<P>Then is S. <HI>Stephens</HI> Chappell, of old
time founded by King <HI>Stephen,</HI> King
<HI>Iohn</HI> in the seventh of his reigne, gran∣ted
to <HI>Baldwinus de London,</HI> Clarke of his
Exchequer, the Chappleship of Saint
<HI>Stephens</HI> at <HI>Westminster,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This Chappell was againe since (of a
farre more curious workemanship) new
builded by King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, in
the yeere 1347. for thirty eight persons
in that Church to serve God, to wit, a
Deane, twelve secular Canons, thirteene
Vicars, foure Clarks, sixe Chorists, two
Servitors, to wit, a Verger, and a keeper
of the Chappell. He builded it for them
from the house of receit, along nigh to
the <HI>Thames,</HI> within the same Palace,
there to inhabite: and since that, there
were also buildings for them, betwixt
the Clock-house, and the <HI>Wool-staple,</HI> cal∣led
the <HI>Wey-house.</HI></P>
<P>Hee also builded to the use of this
Chappell (though out of the Palace
Court) some distance West,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Little Sanctua∣ry.</NOTE> in the
little Sanctuarie, a strong Clochard of
Stone and Timber, covered with Lead,
<PB N="524" REF="274"/>
and placed therein three great Bels,
since usually rung at Coronations, Tri∣umphs,
Funerals of Princes, and their
Obits. Of those Bels men fabuled,
that their ringing sowred all the drinke
in the Towne. More, that about
the biggest Bell was written:</P>
<Q><L>King <HI>Edward</HI> made mee</L>
<L>thirtie thousand and three,</L>
<L>Take me downe and weigh mee,</L>
<L>and more shall ye find mee.</L></Q>
<P>But these Bels being taken down in∣deed,
were found all three not to weigh
twenty thousand.</P>
<P>True it is, that in the Citie of <HI>Roane,</HI>
in <HI>Normandy,</HI> there is one great Bell,
that hath such an Inscription as fol∣loweth:</P>
<Q><L>Ie suis George d'Ambois,</L>
<L>Qui trente cinq mille pois:</L>
<L>Mes lui me pesera,</L>
<L>Trente six mill me trovera.</L>
<L>I am <HI>George</HI> of <HI>Ambois,</HI></L>
<L>Thirtie five thousand in pois:</L>

<P>The said King <HI>Edward</HI> endowed this
Chappell with lands to the yearly va∣lue
of five hundred pound. Doctor
<HI>Iohn Chambers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cloyster of Saint <HI>Stephens</HI> Chappell builded.</NOTE> the Kings Physitian,
the last Deane of this Colledge, buil∣ded
thereunto a Cloyster, of curious

thousand Markes. This Chap∣pell,
or Colledge, at the suppression,
was valued to dispend in lands by the
yeere one thousand eighty five pound,
ten shillings five pence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliamēt House.</NOTE> and was surren∣dred
to <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth: since the
which time, the same Chappell hath
served as a Parliament House.</P>
<P>By this Chappell of S. <HI>Stephen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chappell of our La∣die in the Piew.</NOTE> was
sometime one other smaler Chappell,
called our Lady of the Piew; to the
which Lady, great Offerings were u∣sed
to be made: Amongst other things
I have read, that <HI>Richard</HI> the second, af∣ter
the overthrow of <HI>Wat Tilar,</HI> and o∣ther
the Rebels, in the fourth of his
raigne, went to <HI>Westminster,</HI> and there
giving thankes to God for his victory,
made his Offering in this Chappell.
But as divers have noted, namely, <HI>Iohn
Pigot,</HI> in the yeare 1252. on the seven∣teenth
of February, by negligence of
a Scholler, appointed by his Schoole∣master
to put forth the Lights of this
Chappell, the Image of our Lady rich∣ly
decked with Iewels, precious Stones,
Pearles, and Rings, more than any
Ieweller could judge the price, for so
saith mine author; was with all this
Apparell, Ornaments, and Chappell
it selfe, burnt: but since againe reedi∣fied
by <HI>Anthony,</HI> Earle <HI>Rivers,</HI> Lord
<HI>Scales,</HI> and of the Isle of <HI>Wight,</HI> Vncle

<P>The said Palace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clocke-house at <HI>VVestmin∣ster.</HI></NOTE> before the entry
thereunto, hath a large Court, and in
the same a Tower of Stone, containing
a Clocke, which striketh every houre
on a great Bell, to bee heard into the
Hall in sitting time of the Courts, or o∣therwise:
for the same Clocke, in a
calme, will bee heard into the City of
<HI>London.</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth gave the
keeping of this Clock with the Tower,
called the Clock-house, and the ap∣purtenances,
unto <HI>William Walsby,</HI>
Deane of Saint <HI>Stephens,</HI> with the wa∣ges
of sixe pence the day out of his
Exchequer. By this Tower standeth a
fountaine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foun∣taine in the Palace Court.</NOTE> which at Coronations, and
great Triumphs is made to runne with
Wine out of divers spouts.</P>
<P>On the East side of this Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>VVestmin∣ster</HI> Bridge or com∣mon lan∣ding place▪</NOTE> is an

<P>On the North side, is the South end
of Saint <HI>Stephens</HI> Alley, or <HI>Canon-Row,</HI>
and also a way into the old Wooll sta∣ple:

a great height,<NOTE PLACE="marg">High Tower at <HI>VVestmin∣ster.</HI></NOTE> and many faire

<P>Thus much for the Monasterie and

<P>The <HI>Gate-house</HI> is so called of two

Celerer to the Monasterie, caused
both these Gates (with the appur∣tenances)

<P>On the South side of this Gate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Almes-houses of <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh.</NOTE>

<P>Neere unto this house Westward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chappell of Saint <HI>Anne.</HI></NOTE>

<HEAD>A briefe Declaration of the reasons that moved his
MAIESTIE and the STATE to erect a Colledge of Di∣vines,
and other Learned men, at CHELSEY, together with
the Copy of his Majesties Letters in favouring the same; and
an addition of some Motives forcible to excite good Christians
zeale to a voluntary and liberall contribution.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">V</SEG>Nderstanding by experi∣ence,
that want of in∣formation
hath much
hindred mens devotion
in contributing toward
the erection and dotation of <HI>Chelsey</HI>
Colledge, we have thought it very fit,
together with his Majesties Letters,
seconded by my Lord Archbishop of
<HI>Canterbury,</HI> to declare the reasons that
caused this worke to bee undertaken,
and to adde such Motives, as wee have
supposed may be most effectuall to give
satisfaction to his Majesties desire, and
perfection to this honourable designe.</P>
<P>First it was considered, that the
Popes Agents travelled Sea and Land,
wrote bookes in favour of their faction,
devised lies and slanders, to bring Re∣ligion
and the Professors thereof into
hatred, and not sparing any standing
in their way, by falshood and trechery
oppugned Kings and Princes, that
could not endure the Popes tyrannicall
government. And for this end, men
of ready wits, good speech, long expe∣rience,
and competent learning, have
beene maintained in Colledges, furni∣shed
with Bookes, holpen with Coun∣sell
and directions, bound with Lawes
and Oathes, to uphold the Papall Hie∣rarchie
and Heresie, and which mo∣veth
much, encouraged with great
promises and large rewards.</P>
<P>Whereunto albeit private men pi∣ously
affected have from time to time
opposed themselves, yet because they
wanted encouragement to undertake
so great a labour, counsell of their An∣cients
to direct them, Bookes and Li∣braries
to instruct them, formes of pro∣ceeding
to keepe them in compasse,
and rewards to maintaine them, those
excepted that are due for Ecclesiasti∣call
cures, it was further advised, that
to make a sufficient defence for the
truth of Religion, and honour of the
State, and a strong and continuall op∣position
against the continued lies,
slanders, errors, heresies, sects, idola∣tries,
and blasphemies of our Adversa∣ries,
it was necessary to unite our for∣ces,
and to appoint speciall men, that
without other distraction might at∣tend
the cause of Religion and the
State, being furnished with Directi∣ons,
Instructions, Counsell, Bookes,
Presses, competent maintenance, and
other necessaries.</P>
<P>This then was the reason why this
Colledge by his Majesty and the State
was first designed, and a corporation
granted with large privileges, <HI>viz.</HI> That
a select number of Divines and others
should bee gathered together into one
body, and united with one forme of
Lawes, and there maintained, who be∣ing
furnished with Bookes, and dire∣cted
by men of experience and action,
might alwaies bee ready to maintaine
<PB N="531" REF="277"/>
our Christian faith, to answer the Ad∣versaries
Calumniations as well against
Religion as the State, to defend the
Majesty of Kings and Princes, against
the vsurpation of Popes, the liberty of
Christians, against the yoke of Super∣stition,
to supply the defect of teaching
where Appropriations have devoured
the Ministery, by teaching and confe∣rence
to convince the obstinate Papists
and Atheist, and by all lawfull meanes
to maintaine truth, and discover fals∣hood.</P>
<P>This is the Colledge commended
by his Majesty, and intended by the
State, and easily to bee perfected if it
please all true Christians to further it
with their helpe and favour, according
to some proportion of their means. His
Majesties Letters directed to my Lord
of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> follow in these words:</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Right trusty and well-beloved Coun∣cellour,
we greet you well.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas the enemies of the
Gospell have ever beene for∣ward
to write, and publish
bookes for confirming of erronious doctrine,
and impugning the truth, and now of late
seeme more carefull then before to send
daily into our Realmes such their writings,
whereby our loving Subjects, though other∣wise
well disposed might be seduced, unlesse
some remedy thereof should bee provided.
We by the advise of our Councell, have late∣ly
granted a corporation, and given our
allowance for erecting a Colledge at <HI>Chel∣sey,</HI>
for learned Divines to be imployed to
write as occasion shall require for maintai∣ning
the Religion professed in our King∣domes,
and confuting the impugners there∣of.
Whereupon Doctor <HI>Suteliffe</HI> designed
Provost of the said Colledge, hath now hum∣bly
signified unto us, that vpon divers pro∣mises
of helpe and assistance towards the
erecting and endowing the said Colledge, he
hath at his owne charge begunne, and well
proceeded in the building, as doth suffici∣ently
appeare by a good part thereof already
set up in the place appointed for the same.
We therefore being willing to favour and
further so religious a worke, will and re∣quire

<P>NOw because it is so pious and reli∣gious
a worke, conducing both to
Gods glory, and the saving of ma∣ny
a soule within this Kingdome, I cannot
but wish that all devout and well affected
persons should by your selfe and the Prea∣chers
in your Diocesse, as well publikely as
otherwise, be excited to contribute in some
measure to so holy an intendment now will
beganne. And although these and the like
motions have beene frequent in these latter
times, yet let not those whom God hath
blessed with any wealth bee weary of well∣doing,
that it may not be said that the ido∣latrous
and superstitious Papists bee more
forward to advance their falshoods, then
we are to maintaine Gods Truth. Whatso∣ever
is collected, I pray you Lordship may
be carefully brought unto me; partly that
it passe not thorow any difrauding hand,
and partly that his Majesty may bee ac∣quainted
what is done in this behalfe.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The like Letters are written to my
Lord Chancellour, and my Lord
Maior of London.</HEAD>
<P>By these Letters it may appeare,
that this Colledge is not an idle pro∣ject
of any private man, but a pious
worke projected by the King &amp; State,
and that all that professe Religion, and
desire the continuance and advance∣ment
thereof, yea, all that honour his
Majesty, and wish the prosperity of the
State, and desire the increase of lear∣ning,
have interest therein, and I hope
shall receive contentment, and good
satisfaction by the same.</P>
<P><PB N="532" REF="278"/>
Being then a worke of piety for the
maintenance of true Religion, who can
be accounted truly pious and religious,
and yet yeeld no helpe to advance it?
being a project to maintaine the ho∣nour
of the State, what good Subject
will not contribute to set forward this
project? but to touch onely the point
of Gods honour, let us remember the
words of the Wise man, <HI>Prov. 3. Ho∣nour
the Lord with thy substance.</HI> Let us
also consider what the Lord himselfe
saith, 1 <HI>Sam. 2. Them that honour me, I
will honour; and they that despise mee,
shall be despised.</HI> Now who can say, hee
honoureth God that suffereth him by
idolatry, superstition, and blasphemy to
be dishonoured, and will give nothing
to suppresse <HI>Baals</HI> Priests, and is con∣tent
that the Pope be worshipped like
the Idoll <HI>Bell?</HI> can Gods honour stand
with the superstition, heresie, idola∣try,
and blasphemy of Papists, prophan∣nesse
of Atheists, fanaticall doctrine
of Schismatickes, and idle Novelists?</P>
<P>It is not sufficient for true Christians
to professe true Religion, but they must
with zeale maintaine it, and with heart
abhorre, and with hand suppresse ido∣latry
and superstition, <HI>Who will rise up
with me against the wicked,</HI> saith the Pro∣phet,
<HI>Psal.</HI> 94. And <HI>Psal.</HI> 139. he saith,
<HI>Hee hated those that hated the Lord with
an unfained hatred.</HI> The Law <HI>Deut.</HI> 13.
is direct against such as intice us to
serve other gods, our eye may not pity
them, nor may we shew mercy unto
them, no although they bee our bro∣thers,
or our wives that lie in our bo∣some.</P>
<P><HI>An odious thing also it is, either to
suffer truth to bee suppressed, or lies to
be received. Saint</HI> Augustine in Epist.
ad Casulanum, <HI>saith, It is a fault to hide
truth, as well as to tell lies;</HI> Vterque reus
est, &amp; qui veritatem occultat, &amp; qui
mendacium dicit. Chrysostome Homil. 25.
in Math. <HI>doth charge him to be a Tray∣tor
unto Truth, that dare not boldly
utter it or defend it;</HI> Non ille solum est
proditor veritatis qui veritatem transgre∣diens
pro veritate mendacium loquitur,
sed etiam qui non liberè veritatem pronun∣tiat
quam pronuntiare tenetur, aut non
liberè veritatem defendit quam liberè de∣fendere
convenit.</P>
<P>Some suppose that Christianity and
Popery may stand together, and them∣selves
as Newters stand betweene both,
or as Mediators would reconcile both.
But can Christ bee reconciled to Anti-christ?
there is no concord betwixt
<HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>Belial,</HI> saith the Apostle,
2 <HI>Cor. 6. Elias</HI> told us there is no halt∣ing
betweene two Religions: no man
that honoureth any Creature can say
he truly honoureth God, for God gi∣veth
not his honour to Creatures, <HI>As<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
1 King.</HI> 15. was a good King, yet it is
imputed to him that hee tooke not
downe the high places. The Bishop of
the Church of <HI>Pergamus, Apocal.</HI> 2. is
reproved for suffering them that taught
the doctrine of <HI>Balaam;</HI> and the Bi∣shop
of <HI>Thyatira,</HI> for permitting <HI>Iesabel</HI>
to teach and deceive the people; and
shall the Church of <HI>England</HI> any longer
suffer the Romish Balamites, and the
false Priests of <HI>Baal</HI> maintained by the
Romish <HI>Iesabel</HI> and her Consorts to se∣duce
Gods people? The false Priests of
<HI>Bel</HI> used all art and cunning practices to
deceive, and now will not suffer any
Religion but that of their god <HI>Bel,</HI> the
Pope; and shall not true Christians use
equall diligence to maintaine truth, and
suppresse Popery, and all other idola∣trous
and false Religion? <HI>Ingemui fate∣or</HI>
(saith <HI>Hierome) minus nobis inesse vo∣luntatis
ad propugnandam veritasem,
quam inest illis cupiditatis ad inculcandum
mendacium:</HI> I sighed (saith he) seeing
lesse desire in us to defend truth, then
in our adversaries to maintaine lies.</P>
<P>This Colledge then being erected
for maintenance of truth and Gods true
service, and a resoiute opposition a∣gainst
errors and false worship of God,
it cannot but please God and content
godly men. The same will also bee a
meanes to increase learning, and to sup∣ply
the defects of places haunted with
the spirits of Antichrist, the Jesuits,
and Masse-priests, and therefore can∣not
chuse but be well approved of all,
that either desire a learned Ministery,
or love learning. Finally, seeing the
Church hath received no greater dis∣honour
by any, then by unsufficient and
unlearned Churchmen, I hope this may
bee a meanes to recover some part of
their lost honour.</P>
<P><PB N="533" REF="278"/>
Wherefore, whether we regard the
service of God, or the honour we owe
to our King, or the love wee beare to
our Country and the State, let us not
shew our selves sparing or backward
in yeelding our ayd to set forward a
worke so religious and profitable for
the Church, so honourable for the
State, so necessary in regard of the ma∣lice
of our adversaries, and the defects
and discouragement of our owne for∣ces.
Other collections have beene ei∣ther
for private persons or strangers, or
places remote, or matters concerning
some particular occasions. This con∣cerneth
a generall good, and toucheth
every man both in conscience and ho∣nour.
Heretofore wee have endevou∣red
to maintaine Religion, and favour
others abroad, let us not therefore neg∣lect
our selves, and our owne honour,
profit, and necessary service at home.
Neither let any man thinke it strange,
that a worke of such greatnesse should
be advanced by this weake meanes, or
that a project so necessary should pro∣ceed
so slowly. Almighty God, albeit
all-sufficient, yet would have his owne
Tabernable built by the voluntary offe∣rings
of his people. <HI>Speake,</HI> saith God
to <HI>Moyses, Exod. 25. to the children of
Israel, that they receive an offering for me
of every man whose heart giveth it freely.</HI>
And <HI>Exod.</HI> 36. it followeth, and <HI>they
brought still unto Moyses free gifts every
morning, and they ceased not untill they
were stayed from offering.</HI> King <HI>Solomon</HI>
likewise was greatly holpen in the buil∣ding
of the Temple by the contributi∣on
of his Subjects, as appeareth by the
words of Scriptures, 1 <HI>King.</HI> 9. 19. fur∣ther,
by voluntary offerings and contri∣butions,
the Temple was repaired by
<HI>Ioash, 2 King.</HI> 12. and by <HI>Iosiah, 2 Chron.
34.</HI> and this hath beene the use and
practice of ancient times in building,
and endowing most famous Churches,
Colledges, Schooles, and other Monu∣ments
of Religion and Learning, both
in our owne and other Countries. Our
Adversaries by this course have had
meanes to build many Monasteries and
Colledges, and Schooles for Jesuites
and Friers, as it were propugnacles of
Superstition, Heresie, Idolatry, and
Antichrists tyranny, to uphold and
make good their owne corruptions in
Religion, and usurpations upon the
Magistrates government, and every
Christian mans liberty. And this have
they done not onely in <HI>Europe,</HI> but also
in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and not one in every King∣dome,
but in the same State divers, and
almost in every great City one. And
shall not this flourishing Kingdome
build and endow one Colledge for the
maintenance of Gods true service, and
the honour of the whole State? It were
a dishonour to our Nation, and the
whole Church and State to thinke
contrary.</P>
<P>The worke we confesse hath hither∣to
proceeded slowly: And no marvell,
seeing great workes are not easily at∣chieved.
<HI>Noes</HI> Arke, Gods Tabernacle
and Temple, and famous Schooles and
Colledges, albeit founded by Kings
and great men, were long in build∣ing,
and doe we wonder that this Col∣lege
is not yet finished? further it plea∣sed
God to deprive us of Prince <HI>Henry</HI>
our principall hope, and the chiefe
Author of this designe. Lastly, who
knoweth whether God hath appoin∣ted
these weake meanes to set forward
a great worke, that his power in our
weaknes might have the whole glory?</P>
<P>Let us therefore, good Country∣men
and Christians, hearken willingly
to his Majesties motion, and readily
follow his example. Let it appeare by
our bounty how zealous wee are to
maintaine his everlasting Truth, and
root out error and idolatry. Let us by
effects declare how studious we are to
doe good workes, and to advance our
Countries honour. They that have
much may give of their abundance: the
rest according to the measure of their
meanes. God as well accepteth the
Widowes mite, and poore mans good
will, as the rich mans treasure.</P>
<P>If wee honour God with our sub∣stance,
he will honour us and encrease
our substance. If we build a house for
the maintenance of his truth, that it
may continue to our posterity, God
will uphold our houses, restore to us,
and double it to our posterity. <HI>Abra∣ham</HI>
by offering his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, was made a
father of many sonnes, yea of Nations.
And <HI>Salomon</HI> that shewed his Royall
<PB N="534" REF="279"/>
magnificence in building God a Tem∣ple,
in honour and riches passed all o∣ther
Kings. How then can wee excuse
our selves, if wee deny God a small of∣fring,
that daily offereth to us many
graces, and giveth us all the good
things we possesse. Our soules and bo∣dies
are a sacrifice due to him: and
therefore no Christian may deny to
him an offring out of his wordly goods,
if Gods service require it.</P>
<P>As for those that draw backe in this
service, and refuse to concurre in pro∣moting
Gods honour, let them marke
the words of our Saviour, <HI>Matth. 12.
He that is not with me is against me.</HI> And
the curse of the Angell upon the people
of <HI>Meros, Iudg. 5. Curse ye Meros,</HI> saith
the Angell, <HI>for they came not up to helpe
the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>But we hope we shall not need ma∣ny
words to move them, that already
are so well perswaded, nor to perswade
men, that in Religion and devotion are
so forward. It is the duty of good
Christians to advance Gods honour,
and represse Superstition, Heresie, I∣dolatry,
Blasphemy. It is the office of
good subjects to defend the honour of
the State, against the sycophancies of
English Fugitives, and the secret pra∣ctices
of fortaine enemies their adhe∣rents.
The adversaries using all their
skill, and joyning their forces against
Religion and the State, it behoveth us
likewise to unite our forces, and to
joyne in consultation how to resist
them. This common businesse requi∣reth
common helpe, the practices
of the Adversaries provoke us to use
speed, the quality of the worke being
for defence of Religion and the State,
will move any whose heart is not har∣dened,
cheerefully to give. Whoso∣ever
shall willingly give, shall receive
of God a full reward in this life, and
when they dye, their workes shall fol∣low
them, and then whatsoever they
have given to God on earth, they shall
assuredly finde in Heaven.</P>
<P>Wherefore recommending the Col∣ledge
of <HI>Chelsey</HI> to every religious
Christians devout thoughts, we cease
further to presse them. Only for satis∣faction
of those that desire to know
why this Colledge is erected at <HI>Chelsey,</HI>
and not in one of the Vniversities, this
we thought fit to adde, that this place
was thought most fit to receive directi∣ons
from our Superious, to consult
with men of best experience, to ob∣taine
intelligence from forraigne parts,
to print Bookes, and to disperse them;
And lastly, to obtaine the favour of the
State and City. Further hereby, as all
emulation may bee avoyded, so the
helpe of both Vniversities may as well
be had by entercourse of our Agents,
as if the Colledge stood in either of the
Vniversities. Thus all things now
stand. God blesse the proceeding of
this worke, and give honour to his
owne name, and a happy issue to this
holy designe. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

City, and made it againe habitable, and
then committed the custody thereof to
his Sonne in law <HI>Adhered,</HI> Earle of <HI>Mer∣cia.</HI>
After whose decease, the Citie, with
all other possessions pertaining to the
said Earle, returned to King <HI>Edward,</HI>
sirnamed the Elder, &amp;c. And so remai∣ned
in the Kings hands, being governed

<P>These Governors of old time (saith <HI>Ro∣bert

then used within this Citie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Al∣b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ni.</NOTE> were registred

was of a small hand, sore defaced, and hard

so that it was imbezeled and lost.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rob. Fabian.</NOTE> <HI>Thus farre</HI>
Fabian.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding, I have found by
search of divers old Registers and other
Records abroad; namely, in a Booke
sometime appertaining to the Monaste∣ry
of Saint <HI>Albans,</HI> of the Portgraves,
and other Governours of this City, as
followeth.</P>
<P>First, that in the reigne of King <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>
the last,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Citizens of <HI>London</HI> called Burgesses.</NOTE> before the conquest, <HI>Wolfe∣gare</HI>
was Portgrave, as may appeare by
the Charter of the same King, in these
words:</P>
<P>Edward, <HI>King, greeteth Alfward Bishop,
and Wolfgar my Portgrave, and all the Bur∣gesses
of London.</HI> And afterward, that in
another Charter, King <HI>Edward</HI> greeteth
<HI>William,</HI> Bishop, and <HI>Swetman</HI> my Port∣grave.
And after that, in another Char∣ter
to the Abbey of <HI>Chertsey:</HI> To <HI>William,</HI>
Bishop, and <HI>Leofstane</HI> and <HI>Alffy</HI> Port∣graves.</P>
<P>In the reigne of <HI>William</HI> Conqueror,
<HI>William,</HI> Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> procured of
the said Conqueror his Charter of Li∣berties,
to the same <HI>William,</HI> Bishop, &amp;
<HI>Godfrey,</HI> Portgrave, in the <HI>Saxon</HI> tongue,
and turned into English, thus:</P>
<P><HI>William,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Charter of <HI>William Conqueror.</HI></NOTE> King, greeteth <HI>William,</HI> Bi∣shop,
and <HI>Godfrey,</HI> Portgrave, and all the

law worth, that they were in <HI>Edward</HI> dayes
the King. And I will that each child bee his
Fathers heire. And I will not suffer that a∣ny
man doe you wrong: and God you
keepe.</P>
<P>And then in the reigne of the said
Conquerour, and of <HI>William Rufus, God∣frey
de Magnavile</HI> was Portgrave, (or
Sheriffe) as may appeare by their Char∣ters,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Provost.</NOTE> and <HI>Richard de Par</HI> was Provost.</P>
<P>In the reigne of King <HI>Henry</HI> the first,
<HI>Hugh Buche</HI> was Portgrave, and <HI>Leofsta∣nus,</HI>
Goldsmith, Provost, buried at <HI>Ber∣mondsey.</HI></P>
<P>After them, <HI>Aubery de Vere</HI> was Port∣grave
<PB N="536" REF="284"/>
and <HI>Robert Bar Querel,</HI> Provost.
This <HI>Aubery de Vere</HI> was slaine in the

also, that King <HI>Henry</HI> the first gran∣ted
to the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> the Shi∣rifwicke

another place is shewed.</P>
<P>In the reigne of King <HI>Stephen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sheriffes.</NOTE> <HI>Gilbert
Becket</HI> was Portgrave, and <HI>Andrew Bu∣chevet,</HI>
Provost.</P>
<P>After him, <HI>Godfrey Magnavile,</HI> the
Sonne of <HI>VVilliam,</HI> the Sonne of <HI>God∣frey
Magnavile,</HI> by the gift of <HI>Maud</HI> the
Empresse, was Portgrave or Sheriffe of
<HI>London</HI> and <HI>Middlesex,</HI> for the yeerely
farme of three hundred pound, as ap∣peareth
by the Charter.</P>
<P>In the time of King <HI>Henry</HI> the se∣cond,
<HI>Peter Fitz Walter</HI> was Portgrave;
after him <HI>Iohn Fitz Nigel</HI> was Port∣grave,
after him, <HI>Ernulfus Buchel</HI> became
Portgrave; and after him <HI>VVilliam Fitz

<P>These Portgraves are also in divers
Records called,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Port∣graves, since cal∣led She∣riffes, and Iudges of the Kings Court, &amp; have ther∣fore Vn∣der-She∣riffes, men lear∣ned in the law, to sit in their Courts. <HI>Doomes∣men,</HI> or Iudges of the Kings Court.</NOTE> <HI>Vicecomites,</HI> Vicounties,

for that they then, as since, used that of∣fice
as the Sheriffes of <HI>London</HI> doe till
this day. Some Authors do call them
<HI>Doomes-men, Eldermen,</HI> or Iudges of the
Kings Court.</P>
<P><HI>VVilliam Fitz Stephen,</HI> noting the e∣state
of this City, &amp; Government there∣of
in his time, under the reigne of King
<HI>Stephen,</HI> and of <HI>Henry</HI> the second, hath
these words:</P>
<P>This Citie <HI>(faith he)</HI> even as <HI>Rome,</HI> is
divided into VVards, it hath yeerely She∣riffes
in stead of Consuls, it hath the dignity
of Senators and Aldermen, it hath Vnder-officers,
and according to the qualitie of
Lawes, it hath severall Courts, and generall
Assemblies upon appointed dayes.</P>
<P>Thus much for the antiquity of She∣riffes,
and also of Aldermen in severall
Wards of this Citie may suffice: and
now for the name of Bayliffes, and after
that, of Maiors as followeth.</P>
<P>In the first yeere of King <HI>Richard</HI> the
first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bailiffes of <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> the Citizens of <HI>London</HI> obtained to
bee governed by two Bailiffes, which
Bailiffes are in divers ancient dceds cal∣led
Sheriffes, according to the speech of
the Law, which called the Shire <HI>Balliva,</HI>
for that they (like as the Portgraves)
used the same office of Shrivewicke, for
the which the City paid to fee-farme,
300. <ABBR>l.</ABBR> yeerely as before, since the
reigne of <HI>Henry</HI> the first, which also is
yet paid by the City into the Exchequer
untill this day.</P>
<P>They also obtained to have a Maior,

of them to have sixteene Ser∣geants,
<PB N="652" REF="341"/>
every Sergeant to have his Yeo∣man.
And six Clarkes, to wit, a Se∣condary,

<DIV1 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Maiors and She∣riffes
Liveries somewhat.</HEAD>
<P>TO follow president of former
time, the Clarks of Companies
were to enquire for them of
their Companies, that would have the
Maiors Livery, their money (as a be∣nevolence
given) which must be twen∣ty
shillings at the least put in a purse,
with their names that gave it, and the
Wardens to deliver it to the Maior by
the first of December. For the which,
every man had then sent him foure
yards of broad Cloth, rowed or stri∣ped
thwart with a different colour, to
make him a Gowne, and these were
called Rey Gownes, which was then
the Livery of the Maior, and also of the
Sheriffes; but each differing from others
in the colours.</P>
<P>Of older times I read, that the Offi∣cers
of this City ware Gownes of party
colours, as the right side of one colour,
and the left side of another: as for ex∣ample;
I reade in Bookes of accounts in
the <HI>Guild-Hall,</HI> that in the nineteenth
yeere of <HI>Henry</HI> the sixth, there was
bought for an Officers Gown two yards
of Cloth, coloured <HI>Mustard-villars</HI> (a
colour now out of use) and two yards
of Cloth coloured blue, price two shil∣lings
the yard, in all eight shillings.
More, payed to <HI>Iohn Pope,</HI> Draper, for
two Gowne clothes, eight yards of two
colours <HI>eux ambo deux de Rouge</HI> (or red)
<HI>Medley Brune</HI> and <HI>Porre</HI> (or Purple) co∣lour,
price, the yard two shillings.
These Gownes were for <HI>Piers Rider,</HI> and
<HI>Iohn Buckles,</HI> Clarkes of the Chamber.</P>
<P>More, I reade, that in the yeere 1516.
in the 7. of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8. it was agreed
by a Common Councell in the <HI>Guild-Hall,</HI>
that the Sheriffes of <HI>London</HI> should
(as they had beene accustomed) give
yeerely Reyed Gownes to the Recor∣der,
Chamberlaine, Common Serge∣ant,
and Common Clarke, the Sword-bearer,
Common Hunt, Water-Bayly,
Common Cryer, like as to their owne
Officers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>1525. More, in the sixteenth of <HI>Hen∣ry</HI>
the eighth, Sir <HI>William Bayly</HI> then
being Maior, made a request, for that
clothes of Ray (as hee alleaged) were
evill wrought, his Officers might bee
permitted (contrary to custome) for
that yeere to weare Gownes of one co∣lour,
to the which (in a common Coun∣cell)
one answered and said, Yea, it
might be permitted: and no man said
nay, and so it passed. Thus much for
party-coloured, and Ray Gownes have
I read. But for benevolence to the
Maior, I finde that of later time, each
man giving forty shillings towards his
charges, received foure yards of broad
Cloth to make him a Gowne: for Sir
<HI>Thomas White</HI> performed it in the first
yeere of Queene <HI>Mary,</HI> but Sir <HI>Tho∣mas
Lodge</HI> gave (in stead of foure yards
of broad Cloth) three yards of Satten
to make them Dubblets, and since that,
the three yards of Satten is now tur∣ned
into a silver Spoone, and so it hath
held.</P>

<P>FOr as much as the City of <HI>London</HI>
is of late yeeres sore decayed, and
dayly is like to decay more and
more: A great cause and occasion wher∣of,
among other, hath beene, for that
freemens children (Orphans of the said

Parents, and sometimes after their de∣ceases,
being left wealthy and rich, doe
bestow themselves in ungodly Marria∣ges,
for the most part in their young

without the consent, and against the
mindes of their friends, saying and af∣firming,
that the Law and Custome of

portions, whether they marry by the

dayly cast away and undoe themselves,
in trust to have their said Portions,
<PB N="661" REF="345"/>
whether their parents or friends will or
will not.</P>
<P>And thereby doe they bestow them∣selves
upon simple and light persons,
having neither cunning, knowledge,
substance, nor good or honest conditi∣ons.
By reason whereof, such Orphans,
inordinately, and insolently, doe spend
and consume their patrimony and por∣tions
in short time, not onely to the un∣doing
of themselves, and to the great
ignomy and shame of their friends, but
also to the great slander of the Lord
Maior and Aldermen of this City (who
been reputed and taken as Fathers and
Protectors of the same Orphanes) and
to the great losse and hindrance of the
said City.</P>
<P>And for as much as the said Lord
Maior and Citizens, have by their
lawes, and customes, power and autho∣rity
to make lawes and ordinances, by

authority of the said Common Coun∣cell,
enacted, ordained, authorized, and
established for a law perpetually to bee
observed and kept within the said Ci∣ty:
That if any Orphane, or child of any
free man or free woman of the said Ci∣ty,
doe offend in any the things hereaf∣ter
expressed, and bee thereof lawfully

be unabled and barred to demand

or woman-child, shall maliciously
goe about or attempt to doe, or cause
to be done, any bodily harme, death, or
destruction to his or their Father or
Mother: Or if any man-child doe here∣after

<P>And if the said contract or marriage
of the said Orphane or Orphanes, bee

<HEAD>A
DISCOVRSE OF
THE NAMES AND FIRST
CAVSES OF THE INSTITVTION
of Cities and peopled Townes: And of the com∣modities
that doe grow by the same: and namely,
of the City of LONDON. Written by way of an
Apology (or defence) against the opinion of some men,
which thinke that the greatnesse of that City standeth
not with the profit and security of this Realme.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>Ities and well peopled
places be called <HI>Oppida</HI>
in Latine, either <HI>ab ope
danda,</HI> or <HI>ab opibus,</HI> or
<HI>ab opponendo se hostibus.</HI>
They bee named also
<HI>Civitates a coëundo,</HI> and <HI>(urbes)</HI> either of
the word <HI>urbare,</HI> because the first inclo∣sure
of them was described with the
draught of a Plow, or else <HI>ab orbe,</HI> for the
round compasse that they at the first
had.</P>
<P>In the Greek a City is tearmed <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
either of the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>multus,</HI> or of
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>id est, habitare, alere, gu∣bernare.</HI></P>
<P>In the Saxon (or old English) some∣times
<HI>Tun,</HI> which we now call Towne,
derived of the word <HI>Tynan,</HI> to enclose
or tyne, as some yet speake. But for as
much as that word was proper to every
Village, and inclosed dwelling, there∣fore
our Ancestors called their walled
Townes, Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h or Bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and we now
Bury and Borow, of the Greeke word
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, (as I thinke) which signifieth a
Tower or a high building.</P>
<P>The walls of these Townes had their
name of <HI>vallum,</HI> because at the first they
were but of that earth which was cast
out of the trench, or ditch wherewith
they were environed.</P>
<P><HI>But afterward, being made of matter
more fit for defence, they were named</HI>
A muniendo maenia. <HI>By the Etymologie
of these names it may appeare, that
Common Weales, Cities and Townes
were at first invented, to the end that
men might lead a civill life amongst
themselves, and be saved harmelesse a∣gainst
their enemies: Whereupon</HI> Plato
<HI>saith,</HI> Civitates ab initio utilitatis causa
constitutae sunt. Aristotle, 1. Politicorum
2. <HI>saith,</HI> Civitas à natura profecta est:
homo enim animal aptum est ad coetus, &amp;
proinde civitatis origo ad vivendum, insti∣tutio
ad bene vivendum refertur. <HI>And</HI>
Cicero, lib. primo de inventione, <HI>in the be∣ginning
saith,</HI> Fuit quoddam tempus cùm
in agris homines passim bestiarum more va∣gabantur,
&amp;c. quo quidem tempore, qui∣dam
(magnus viz. vir &amp; sapiens) dispersos
homines in agris, &amp; tectis silvestribus ab∣ditos,
ratione quadam compulit in unum lo∣cum,
at{que} eos in unamquam{que} rem induxit
utilem &amp; honestam. Vrbibus vero consti∣tutis
fidem colere, &amp; justitiam retinere
discebant, &amp; aliis parere sua voluntate con∣suescebant,
&amp;c. <HI>The same man discour∣seth
notably to the same effect, in his
Oration</HI> Pro Sestio, <HI>a little after the mid∣dest
thereof, shewing that in the life of
men dispersed,</HI> vis, <HI>beareth all the sway:
but in the civill life and society,</HI> ars, <HI>is
<PB N="692" REF="361"/>
better maintained, &amp;c. This thing
well saw King</HI> William <HI>the Conqueror,
who in his lawes, folio 125. saith,</HI> Burgi
&amp; Civitates fundata, &amp; edificata sunt, ad
tuitionem gentium &amp; populorum Regni, &amp;
idcirco observari debent cum omni liberta∣te,
integritate &amp; ratione. <HI>And his Prede∣cessors,
King</HI> Ethelstane, <HI>and King</HI> Ca∣nutus
<HI>in their Lawes, fol. 62. and 106.
had commanded thus:</HI> Oppida instau∣rantur,
&amp;c.</P>
<P>Seeing therefore that as <HI>Cicero, 2.
officior.</HI> saith, <HI>Proxime &amp; secundum Deos,
homines hominibus maxime utiles esse pos∣sunt.</HI>
And that men are congregated
into Cities and Common-wealths, for
honesty and utilities sake, these shortly
be the commodities that doe come by
Cities, Cōminalties, and Corporations.
First, men by this neerenesse of conver∣sation,
are withdrawne from barbarous
ferity and force, to a certaine mildnesse
of manners and to humanity and ju∣stice:
whereby they are contented to
give and take right, to and from their
equals and inferiors, and to heare and
obey their heads and superiors. Also
the Doctrine of God is more fitly deli∣vered,
and the discipline thereof more
aptly to be executed, in peopled Towns
than abroad, by reason of the facility of
common and often assembling. And
consequently, such inhabitants bee bet∣ter
managed in order, and better in∣structed
in wisedome: whereof it came
to passe that at the first, they that ex∣celled
others this way, were called <HI>A∣stuti,</HI>
of the Greeke word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which sig∣nifieth
a City, although the terme bee
now declined to the worst part, and doe
betoken evill, even as <HI>Tyrannus Sophista,</HI>
and some such other originally good
words are fallen: And hereof also good
behavior is yet called <HI>Vrbanitas,</HI> because
it is rather found in Cities, than else∣where.
In some, by often hearing, men
be better perswaded in Religion, and
for that they live in the eye of others,
they bee by example the more easily
trained to justice, and by shamefastnesse
restrained from injury.</P>
<P>And whereas Commonwealths and
Kingdomes cannot have, next after
God, any surer foundation, than the
love and good will of one man towards
another, that also is closely bred and
maintained in Cities, where men by
mutuall society and companying toge∣ther,
doe grow to alliances, Commi∣nalties
and Corporations.</P>
<P>The liberall sciences and learnings
of all sorts, which bee <HI>Iumina reipublicae,</HI>
doe flourish onely in peopled Townes,
without the which a Realme is in no
better case than a man that lacketh both
his eyes.</P>
<P><HI>Manual</HI> Arts or handy crafts, as they
have for the most part been invented in
Townes and Cities, so they cannot any
where else bee either maintained or a∣mended.
The like is to bee said of
Merchandize, under which name I
comprehend all manner of buying, sel∣ling,
bartering, exchanging, commu∣nicating
of things that men need to and
fro. Wealth and riches, which are
truely called, <HI>Subsidia belli, &amp; ornamen∣ta
pacis,</HI> are increased chifely in Townes
and Cities, both to the Prince and peo∣ple.</P>
<P>The necessity of the poore and needy
is in such places both sooner to be espi∣ed,
and hath meanes to be more chari∣tably
relieved.</P>
<P>The places themselves be surer refu∣ges,
in all extremities of forrain invasi∣on,
and the inhabitants be a ready hand
and strength of men with munition to
oppresse intestine sedition.</P>
<P>Moreover, for as much as the force of
the warres of our time consisteth chief∣ly
in shot, all other Souldiers being ei∣ther
horse-men or footmen, armed on
land, or Mariners at the Sea: It see∣meth
to me, that Citizens and Townes∣men
be as fit to bee imploied in any of
these services, that on horse backe onely
excepted, as the inhabitants that bee
drawne out of the Country.</P>
<P>Furthermore, even as these societies
and assemblies of men in Cities and
great Townes, are a continuall bridle a∣gainst
tyranny, which was the cause that
<HI>Tarquin, Nero, Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nisius,</HI> and such o∣thers
have alwaies sought to weaken
them. So, being well tempered, they
are a strong fort and Bulwarke not only
in the <HI>Aristocritie,</HI> but also in the Law∣full
Kingdome or just royalty.</P>
<P>At once propagation of the Religiō, the
execution of good policy, the exercise
of charity, and the defence of the coun∣trey,
<PB N="693" REF="361"/>
is best performed by Townes and
Citties: and this civill life approach∣eth
neerest to the shape of that mysti∣call
body whereof Christ is the head,
and men be the members: whereupon
both at the first, that man of God <HI>Moses,</HI>
in the common wealth of the Israelites,
and the Governours of all Countries in
all ages sithence, have continually main∣tained
the same. And to change it,
were nothing else but to Metamor∣phose
the world, and to make wilde
beasts of reasonable men. To stand lon∣ger
upon this, it were <HI>in re non dubia, uti
oratione non necessaria;</HI> and therefore I
will come to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Singularities of the
City of LONDON.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>Hatsoever is said of Cities
generally, maketh also
for LONDON specially:
Howbei t these things
are particularly for our
purpose to bee considered in it. The
situation; the former estimation that
it hath had; the service that it hath
done; the present estate and govern∣ment
of it, and such benefits as doe
grow to the Realme by the mainte∣nance
thereof.</P>
<P>This Realme hath onely three prin∣cipall
Rivers, whereon a Royall City
may well bee situated: <HI>Trent</HI> in the
North, <HI>Severne</HI> in the South-West, and
<HI>Thames</HI> in the South-East: of the
which, <HI>Thames,</HI> both for the strait course
in length, reacheth furthest into the
belly of the land; and for the breadth
and stilnesse of the water, is most navi∣gable
up and downe the streame: by
reason whereof, <HI>London</HI> standing al∣most
in the middle of that course, is
more commodiously served with pro∣vision
of necessaries, then any Towne
standing upon the other two Rivers can
be, and doth also more easily commu∣nicate
to the rest of the Realme, the
commodities of her owne entercourse
and trafficke.</P>
<P>This River openeth indifferently upon
<HI>France</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> our mightiest
neighbours, to whose doings we ought
to have a bent eye and speciall regard:
and this City standeth thereon in such
convenient distance from the Sea, as
it is not onely neere enough for intelli∣gence
of the affaires of those Princes,
and for the resistance of their attempts:
but also sufficiently removed from the
feare of any sudden dangers that may
be offered by them: whereas for the
Prince of this Realme to dwell upon
<HI>Trent,</HI> were to turne his backe, or blind
side, to his most dangerous borderers:
and for him to rest and dwell upon <HI>Se∣verne,</HI>
were to be shut up in a cumber∣some
corner, which openeth but upon
<HI>Ireland</HI> only, a place of much lesse im∣portance.</P>
<P>Neither could <HI>London</HI> be pitched so
commodiously upon any other part of
the same River of <HI>Thames,</HI> as where it
now standeth. For if it were removed
more to the West, it should lose the
benefit of the ebbing and flowing: and
if it were seated more towards the
East, it should bee neerer to danger
of the enemy, and further both from
the good Ayre, and from doing good
to the inner parts of the Realme: nei∣ther
may I omit, that none other place
is so plentifully watered with springs,
as <HI>London</HI> is.</P>
<P>And whereas amongst other things,
Corne and Cattell, Hay and Fuell bee
of great necessity: of the which, Cat∣tell
may bee driven from afarre, and
Corne may easily be transported. But
Hay and Fuell, being of greater bulke
and burthen, must be had at hand: only
<HI>London,</HI> by the benefit of this situation
and River, may bee sufficiently served
therewith. In which respect and Alder∣man
of <HI>London</HI> reasonably (as mee
thought) affirmed, that although <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
received great nourishment by the
residence of the Prince, the repaire of
the Parliament, and Courts of Iustice,
yet it stood principally by the advan∣tage
of the situation upon the River:
for when as on a time it was told him
by a Courtier, that Queene <HI>Mary,</HI> in
her displeasure against <HI>London,</HI> had ap∣pointed
to remove with the Parlia∣ment
and Terme to Oxford; this plaine
man demanded, Whether shee meant
<PB N="694" REF="362"/>
also to divert the River of <HI>Thames</HI> from
<HI>London,</HI> or no? And when the Gentle∣man
had answered, No; Then quoth
the Alderman, by Gods grace we shall
doe well enough at <HI>London,</HI> whatsoever
become of the Terme and Parliament.
I my selfe being then a young Scholler
at Oxford, did see great preparation
made towards that Tearme and Parlia∣ment,
and doe well remember that the
common opinion and voyce was, that
they were not holden there, because
provision of Hay could not be made in
all the Country to serve for ten whole
dayes together, and yet is that quarter
plentifully stored with Hay for the pro∣portion
of the shire it selfe.</P>
<P>For proofe of the ancient estimation
of <HI>London,</HI> I will not use the authority
of the British Historie, nor of such as
follow it (although some hold it credi∣ble
enough that <HI>London</HI> was first <HI>Tri∣nobantum
civitas,</HI> or <HI>Troia nova,</HI> that fa∣mous
City in our Histories, and then
<HI>Luds Towne,</HI> and by corruption <HI>London,</HI>
as they report) because they be not of
sufficient force to draw the gain-sayers.
Neither will I stand much upon that
honourable Testimony which <HI>Gervas.

it was called <HI>Camera Regis,</HI> as <HI>Tho∣mas
Walsingham</HI> reporteth. I passe over
the recitall of the Saxon Charter of
King <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour; or the
Latine Charters of <HI>Henry</HI> the first and
second; of <HI>Richard</HI> the first; of <HI>Iohn;</HI>
and of <HI>Edward</HI> the first; all which gave
unto the Citizens of <HI>London</HI> great Pri∣viledges,
and of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, who
reciting all the grants of his Predeces∣sors,
not onely confirmed, but also in∣creased
the same: and of the lat∣ter
Kings, who have likewise added
many things thereunto. Onely I wish
to bee noted by them, that during all
this time, all those wife and politike
Princes have thought it fit, not onely to
maintaine <HI>London</HI> in such plight as
they found it, but also to adorne, in∣crease,
and amplifie it with singular
tokens of their liberall favour and good
liking. And whether there bee not
now the same or greater causes to draw
the like or better estimation and che∣rishing,
let any man be judge, that will
take the paines to compare the present
estate of <HI>London,</HI> yet still growing to
better, with the former condition of
the same.</P>
<P>It were too much to recite particu∣larly
the Martiall services that this Ci∣ty
hath done from time to time: nei∣ther
doe I thinke that they be all com∣mitted
to writing; only for a taste, as it
were, I will note these few following.</P>
<P>Almost threescore yeeres before the
Conquest, a huge Army of the <HI>Danes,</HI>
(where of King <HI>Sweyne</HI> was the Leader)
besieged King <HI>Etheldred</HI> in <HI>London</HI> (then
<PB N="695" REF="362"/>
the which, as the story saith, then hee
had none other refuge) but they were
manfully repulsed, and a great number
of them slaine.</P>
<P>After the death of this <HI>Sweyne,</HI> his
sonne <HI>Canutus</HI> (afterward King of <HI>Eng∣land)</HI>
besieged <HI>London,</HI> both by land and
by water: but after much labour, find∣ing
it impregnable, he departed: and
in the same yeere repairing his forces,
hee girded it with a new siege, in the
which the Citizens so defended them∣selves,
and offended him, that in the end
he went away with shame.</P>
<P>In the dissnsion that arose between
King <HI>Edward</HI> the Confessor, and his
Father in law Earle <HI>Goodwin</HI> (which
was the mightiest subject within this
Land that ever I have read of) The
Earle with a great Army came to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
and was, for all that, by the counte∣nance
of the Citizens resisted, till such
time as the Nobility made reconci∣liation
betweene them. About seventy
yeeres after the Conquest, <HI>Maude</HI> the
Empresse made warre upon King <HI>Ste∣phen</HI>
for the right of the Crowne, and
had taken his person prisoner, but by
the strength and assistance of the Lon∣doners
and Kentishmen, <HI>Maude</HI> was
put to flight at <HI>Winchester,</HI> and her Bro∣ther
<HI>Robert</HI> then Earle of <HI>Glocester,</HI> was
taken in exchange, for whom King
<HI>Stephen</HI> was delivered; I dispute not
whose right was better, but I avouch
the service, seeing <HI>Stephen</HI> was in pos∣session.</P>
<P>The History of <HI>William Walworth</HI> the
Maior of <HI>London,</HI> is well knowne, by
whose manhood and policy, the person
of <HI>Richard</HI> the second was rescued, the
City saved, <HI>Wat Tyler</HI> killed, and all
his stragglers discomfited, in reward of
which service, the Maior and other Al∣dermen
were Knighted.</P>
<P><HI>Iacke Cade</HI> also having discomfited
the Kings Army, that was sent against
him, came to <HI>London</HI> and was there
manfully and with long fight resisted,
until that by the good policy of the Ci∣tizens,
his Company was dispersed.</P>
<P>Finally, in the tenth yeere of the raign
of King <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and not ma∣ny
dayes before the death of <HI>Henry</HI> the
sixth, <HI>Tho. Nevill,</HI> commonly called the
Bastard of <HI>Fauconbridge,</HI> armed a great
Company against the King, and being
denied passage thorow <HI>London,</HI> hee as∣saulted
it on divers parts: but hee was
repulsed by the Citizens, and chased
as farre as <HI>Stratford,</HI> with the losse of a
great many.</P>
<P>Thus much of certaine their princi∣pall,
and personall services, in warre on∣ly:
for it were infinite to repeat the par∣ticular
aides of men and money which
<HI>London</HI> hath ministred: and I had ra∣ther
to leave it to be conjectured at, by
comparison to bee made betweene it,
and other Cities, whereof I will give
you this one note for an example. In
the twelfth yeere of the raigne of King
<HI>Edward</HI> the second, it was ordered by
Parliament, that every City of the
Realme should make out Souldiers a∣gainst
the <HI>Scots:</HI> at which time <HI>London</HI>
was appointed to send two hundred
men, and <HI>Canterbury,</HI> being then one of
our best Cities, forty, and no more. And
this proportion of five to one, is now
in our age encreased, at the least five to
one, both in Souldiers and subsidy. As
for the other services that <HI>London</HI> hath
done in times of peace, they are to bee
measured by consideration of the com∣modities,
whereof I will speake anon.
In the meane season let the estate and
government of this City be considred,
to the end that it may appeare that it
standeth well with the policy of the
Realme.</P>
<P><HI>Caesar</HI> in his Commentaries is wit∣nesse,
that in his time the Cities of <HI>Bri∣taine</HI>
had large Teritories annexed unto
them, and were severall estates of them∣selves,
governed by particular Kings or
Potentates, as in <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> yet
be: and that <HI>Mandubratius</HI> was King
of the Trinobants, whose chiefe City
<HI>London</HI> is taken to have beene. And I
finde not that this government was al∣tered,
either by <HI>Caesar,</HI> or his successors,
notwithstanding that the Country be∣came
to bee tributary unto them: but
that it continued, untill at length the
<HI>Britaines</HI> themselves reduced all their
peoples into one Monarchy, howbeit
that lasted not any long season: for up∣on
<HI>Vortiger</HI> their King, came the <HI>Saxons</HI>
our Ancestors, and they drave the <HI>Bri∣tains</HI>
into <HI>Wales, Cornwall,</HI> and <HI>Britain</HI> in
<HI>France,</HI> and in processe of warre divided
<PB N="696" REF="363"/>
the Country amongst themselves into
an Eptarchy, or seven Kingdomes, of
the which one was called the King∣dome
of the East Saxons, which having
in manner the same limits that the Bi∣shopricke
of <HI>London</HI> now enjoyeth, con∣tained
<HI>Essex, Middlesex,</HI> and a part of
<HI>Hertfordshire,</HI> and so included <HI>London.</HI>
Againe it appeareth, that in course of
time, and about 1800. yeeres after
Christ, <HI>Egbert</HI> (then King of the West
Saxons) <HI>Vt pisces saepe minutos magnus
comest,</HI> overcame the rest of the Kings,
and once more erected a Monarchy, the
which till the comming in of the <HI>Nor∣manes,</HI>
and from thence even hitherto
hath continued.</P>
<P>Now I doubt not (whatsoever <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
was in the time of <HI>Caesar)</HI> but that
under the Eptarchy and Monarchy it
hath been a subject, and no free City,
though happily endowed with some
large priviledges: for King <HI>William</HI> the
Conquerour found a Portreeve there,
whose name was <HI>Godfrey</HI> (by which
name hee greeteth him in his Saxon
<HI>Chre)</HI> and his office was none other than
the charge of a Bayliffe, or Reeve, as by
the selfe-same name continuing yet in
Gravesend, and certaine other places
may well appeare. But the Frenchmen
using their owne language, called him
sometime a Provost, and sometime a
Bayliffe; whatsoever his name and Of∣fice
were, he was <HI>Perpetuus Magistratus,</HI>
given by the Prince, and not chosen by
the Citizens, as it seemeth, for what
time King <HI>Richard</HI> the first needed mo∣ny
towards his expedition in the Holy
Land, they first purchased of him the
liberty to choose yeerely from amongst
themselves two Bailiffes: and King
<HI>Iohn</HI> his successor, at their like suit chan∣ged
their Bayliffes into a Maior, and
two Sheriffes. To these <HI>Henry</HI> the third
added Aldermen; at the first elegible
yeerely, but afterward by King <HI>Edward</HI>
the third made perpetuall Magistrates,
and Justices of the peace within their
Wards, in which plight of governe∣ment
it presently standeth. This
shortly as I could, is the Historicall
and outward estate of <HI>London:</HI> now
come I to the inward pith and sub∣stance.</P>
<P>The estate of this City is to be exa∣mined
by the quantity, and by the qua∣litie.</P>
<P>The quantity therefore consisteth in
the number of the Citizens, which is ve∣ry
great, and farre exceedeth propor∣tion
of <HI>Hippodamus,</HI> which appointed
10000. and of others which haue set
downe other numbers, as meete stints
in their opinions to be well gouerned;
but yet seeing both reason and experi∣ence
have f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed us from the law of any
definite number, so that other things
be observed, let that be admitted: nei∣ther
is <HI>London,</HI> I feare mee, so great as
populous: for well saith one, <HI>Non idem
est magna Civitas &amp; frequens, magna est
enim quae multos habet qui arma ferre pos∣sunt:</HI>
Whatsoever the number bee, it
breedeth no feare of sedition: for as
much as the same consisteth not in the
extremes, but in a very mediocrity of
wealth and riches, as it shall better ap∣peare
anon. And if the causes of Eng∣lish
Rebellions bee searched out, they
shall bee found in effect to bee these
twaine, Ambition and Covetousnesse,
of which the first raigneth in the minds
of high and noble personages, or of such
others, as seeke tobee gracious and po∣pular,
and have robbed the hearts of the
multitude, whereas in <HI>London</HI> if any
where in the world, <HI>Honos verè onus est,</HI>
and every man rather shunneth than
seeketh the Maiorality, which is the
best marke amongst them, neither hath
there been any strong faction, nor any
man more popular than the rest, for as
much as the government is by a Patern,
as it were, and alwaies the same, how
often soever they change their Magi∣strate.
Covetousnesse, that other Syre
of sedition, possesseth the miserable and
needy sort, and such as bee naughty∣packes,
unthrifts, which although it
cannot be chosen, but that in a frequent
City as <HI>London</HI> is, there shall be found
many, yet beare they not any great sway
seeing the multitude and most part
there is of a competent wealth, and ear∣nestly
bent to honest labour. I confesse
that <HI>London</HI> is a mighty arme and in∣strument
to bring any great desire to
effect, if it may be won to a mans devo∣tion:
whereof also there want not ex∣amples
in the English Historie. But
for as much as the same is by the like
<PB N="697" REF="363"/>
reason serviceable and meet to impeach
any disloyall attempt, let it rather bee
well governed then evill liked there∣fore;
for it shall appeare anon, that as
<HI>London</HI> hath adhered to some rebelli∣ons,
so hath it resisted many, and was
never the Author of any one. The qua∣lity
of this City consisteth either in the
Law and government thereof: or in
the degrees and condition of the Citi∣zens,
or in their strength and riches.</P>
<P>It is besides the purpose to dispute,
whether the estate of the government
here be a <HI>Democratie,</HI> or <HI>Aristocratie,</HI> for
whatsoever it bee, being considered in
it selfe, certaine it is, that in respect of
the whole Realme, <HI>London</HI> is but a Ci∣tizen,
and no City; a subject, and no
free estate; an obedienciary, and no
place endowed with any distinct or ab∣solute
power: for it is governed by the
same Law that the rest of the Realme
is, both in causes Criminall and Civill,
a few customes onely excepted, which
also are to bee adjudged, or forjudged
by the common Law. And in the as∣sembly
of the estates of our Realme
(which we call Parliament) they are
but a member of the Comminalty, and
send two Burgesses for their City, as
every poore Borough doth, and two
Knights for their County, as every o∣ther
Shire doth, and are as straightly
bound by such Lawes, as any part of the
Realme is: for if contribution in subsi∣dy
of money to the Prince be decreed,
the Londoners have none exemption,
no not so much as to assesse themselves:
for the Prince doth appoint the Com∣missioners.</P>
<P>If Souldiers must be mustered, Lon∣doners
have no Law to keepe them∣selves
at home; if provision for the
Princes houshold be to be made, their
goods are not priviledged. In summe
therefore, the government of <HI>London</HI>
differeth not in substance, but in cere∣mony
from the rest of the Realme, as
namely, in the names and choice of
their Officers, and in their Guildes and
Fraternities, established for the main∣tenance
of Handicrafts and Labourers,
and for equity and good order, to bee
kept in buying and selling. And yet in
these also are they to bee controlled
by the generall Law: for by the Sta∣tutes
of 28. <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>chap.</HI> 10.
and of the first of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, <HI>chap.
15.</HI> the points of their misgovernment
are inquirable by the inhabitants of the
forren Shires adjoyning, and punish∣able
by such Iusticiars as the Prince
shall thereunto depute: to conclude
therefore, the estate of <HI>London</HI> for go∣vernment,
is so agreeable a Symphony
with the rest, that there is no feare of
dangerous discord to ensue thereby.</P>
<P>The multitude (or whole body) of
this populous City is two wayes to bee
considered, generally, &amp; specially: ge∣nerally,
they bee naturall Subjects, a
part of the Commons of this Realme,
and are by birth for the most part a
mixture of all Countries of the same,
by blood Gentlemen, Yeomen, and of
the basest sort without distinction; and
by profession busie Bees, and travellers
for their living in the hive of this Com∣mon-wealth;
but specially considered,
they consist of these three parts, Mer∣chants,
Handicrafts-men, and Labou∣rers.
Merchandise is also divided into
these three sorts; Navigation, by the
which, Merchandizes are brought, and
carried in and out over the Seas: Inve∣ction,
by the which, commodities are
gathered into the City, and dispersed
from thence into the Country by land:
and Negotiation, which I may call the
keeping of a retayling or standing Shop.
In common speech, they of the first sort
bee called Merchants, and both the o∣ther
Retaylers. Handicrafts-men bee
those which doe exercise such Arts as
require both labour and cunning, as
Goldsmithes, Taylors, and Haberdash∣ers,
Skinners, &amp;c. Labourers and Hire∣lings,
I call those <HI>Quorum operae non ar∣tes
emuntur,</HI> as <HI>Tully</HI> saith, of which
sort bee Porters, Carmen, Water∣men,
&amp;c. Againe, these three sorts
may be considered, either in respect of
their wealth, or number: in wealth,
Merchants, and some of the chiefe Re∣taylers
have the first place: the most
part of Retaylers, and all Artificers, the
second or meane place: and Hirelings,
the lowest roome: But in number,
they of the middle place bee first, and
doe farre exceed both the rest: Hire∣lings
be next, and Merchants bee the
last. Now out of this, that the estate
<PB N="698" REF="364"/>
of <HI>London,</HI> in the persons of the Citi∣zens,
is so friendly interlaced, and knit
in league with the rest of the Realme,
not onely at their beginning by birth
and blood (as I have shewed) but also
very commonly at their ending by life
and conversation (for that Merchants
&amp; rich men being satisfied with gaine,
doe for the most part) marry their chil∣dren
into the Countrey, and convey
themselves after <HI>Ciceroes</HI> counsell, <HI>Ve∣luti-ex
pontu in agros &amp; possessiones:</HI> I
doe referre, that there is not onely no
danger towards the common quiet
thereby, but also great occasion and
cause of good love and amity. Out of
this, that they be generally bent to tra∣vell,
and doe flie poverty, <HI>Per mare,
per saxa, per ignes,</HI> as the Poet saith▪ I
draw hope, that they shall escape the
note of many vices, which idle people
doe fall into. And out of this, that they
be a great multitude, and that yet the
greatest part of them bee neither too
rich nor too poore, but doe live in the
mediocritie: I conclude with <HI>Aristotle,</HI>
that the Prince needeth not to feare se∣dition
by them, for thus saith he, <HI>Mag∣nae
vrbes, magis sunt à seditione liberae,
quod in eis dominetur mediocritas, nam in
parvis nihil medium est, sunt enim omnes
vel pauperes vel opulenti.</HI> I am now to
come to the strength and power of this
City, which consisteth partly in the
number of the Citizens themselves,
whereof I have spoken before, partly
in their riches, and in their warlike fur∣niture:
for as touching the strength of the
peece it selfe, that is apparent to the
eye, and therfore is not to be treated of.</P>
<P>The wealth and warlike furniture of
<HI>London,</HI> is either publike or private, and
no doubt the common treasure cannot
be much there, seeing that the revenue
which they have, hardly sufficeth to
maintaine their Bridge, and Conduits,
and to pay their officers and servants.
Their Toll doth not any more then pay
their Fee-Farme that they pay to the
Prince. Their Issues for default of ap∣pearances
bee never levied, and the
profits of their Courts of Iustice doe
goe to particular mens hands. Argu∣ments
hereof bee these two, one, that
they can doe nothing of extraordinary
charge, without a generall contributi∣on:
another, that they have suffered
such as have borne the chiefe office a∣mongst
them, and were become Bank∣rupt,
to depart the City without re∣liefe,
which I thinke they neither
would nor could have done, it the com∣mon
Treasure had sufficed to cover
their shame; hereof therefore we need
not bee afraid. The publike Armour
and munition of this City remaineth
in the Halls of the Companies, as it
doth thorow out the whole Realme, for
a great part, in the Parish Churches;
neither is that kept together, but onely
for obedience to the Law, which com∣mandeth
it; and therefore if that threa∣ten
danger to the State, it may by a∣nother
law bee taken from them, and
committed to a more safe Armory.</P>
<P>The private riches of <HI>London,</HI> resteth
chiefly in the hands of the Merchants &amp;
Retaylers; for Artificers have not much
to spare; and Labourers had need that
it were given unto them. Now, how
necessary and serviceable the estate of
Merchandise is to this Realme, it may
partly appeare by the practice of that
peaceable, politike, and rich Prince,
King <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, of whom <HI>Po∣lidore</HI>
(writing his life) saith thus, <HI>Mer∣catores
Ille saepenumero pecunia multa data
gratuite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uvabat, ut mercatura ars una
omnium cunctis aequè mortalibus tum com∣moda,
tum necessariae, in suo Regno copiosior
esset.</HI> But chiefly by the inestimable
cōmodities that grow thereby: for who
knoweth not that we have extreme need
of many things, whereof forraine Coun∣tries
have great store, and that we may
spare many things whereof they have
need? or who is ignorant of this, that
we have no Mines of Silver or Gold
within our Realme, so that the increase
of our Coine and Bulloine commeth
from elsewhere, &amp; yet neverthelesse, we
be both fed, clad, and otherwise served
with forraine commodities &amp; delights,
as plentifull as with our domesticall?
which thing commeth to passe by the
meanes of Merchandise onely, which
importeth necessaries from other coun∣tries,
and exporteth the superfluities of
our owne. For seeing we have no way
to increase our Treasure, by Mines of
Gold or Silver at home, and can have
nothing without Money or Ware from
<PB N="699" REF="364"/>
other Countries abroad, it followeth
necessarily, that if we follow the Coun∣sell
of that good old Husband <HI>Marcus
Cato,</HI> saying, <HI>Oportet patremfamilias
vendacem esse, non emacem,</HI> and doe car∣ry
more commodities in value over the
Seas, than we bring hither from thence:
that then the Realme shall receive that
overplus in mony: but if we bring from
beyond the Seas Merchandize of more
value, than that which we doe send o∣ver
may countervaile, then the Realme
payeth for that overplus in ready mony,
and consequently is a loser by that ill
husbandry: and therefore in this part
great and heedfull regard must be had,
that <HI>Symmetria</HI> and due proportion bee
kept, lest otherwise either the Realme
bee defrauded of her treasure, or the
Subjects corrupted in vanity, by exces∣sive
importation of superfluous and
needlesse Merchandize, or else that we
feele penurie, even in our greatest plen∣ty
and store, by immoderate exportati∣on
of our owne needfull commodities.
Other the benefits that Merchandize
bringeth, shall hereafter appeare in the
generall recitall of the commodities
that come by <HI>London,</HI> and therefore it
resteth that I speake a word of Retay∣lors,
and finally shew that much good
groweth by them both. The chiefe
part of Retayling, is but a hand-maid
to Merchandize, dispersing by piece-meale
that which the Merchant bring∣eth
in grosse: of which trade be Mercers,
Grocers, Vinteners, Haberdashers, I∣ronmongers,
Millayners, and all such
as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell wares growing or made beyond
the Seas, and therefore so long as Mer∣chandize
it selfe shall be profitable, and
such proportion kept, as neither we lose
our treasure thereby, nor be cloyed with
unnecessary forraine wares, this kind of
Retayiing is to be retained also.</P>
<P>Now, that Merchants and Retaylors
of <HI>London</HI> be very rich and great, it is so
farre from any harme, that it is a thing
both praise-worthy and profitable: for
<HI>Mercatura</HI> (saith <HI>Cicero) si tenuis est, sor∣dida
putanda est, sin magna est &amp; copiosa,
non est vituperanda.</HI> And truely Mer∣chants
and Retaylers doe not altogether
<HI>intus Canere,</HI> and profit themselves only:
for the Prince and Realme both are in∣riched
by their riches: the Realme win∣neth
treasure, if their Trade bee so mo∣derated
by authority, that it breake not
proportion, and they besides beare a
good fleece, which the Prince may
sheare when he seeth good.</P>
<P>But here before I conclude this part,
I have shortly to answer the accusation
of those men, which charge <HI>London</HI>
with the losse and decay of many (or
most) of the ancient Cities, corporate
Townes and Markets within this
Realme, by drawing from them to her
selfe alone, say they, both all trade of
trafficke by Sea, and the Retayling of
Wares, and exercise of Manuali Arts
also. Touching Navigation, which I
must confesse, is apparantly decayed
in many port Townes, and flourisheth
onely or chiefly at <HI>London,</HI> I impute that
partly to the fall of the Staple, the
which being long since a great Trade,
and bestowed sometimes at one Town,
and sometimes at another within the
Realme, did much enrich the place
where it was, and being now not one∣ly
diminished in force, but also
translated over the Seas, cannot but
bring some decay with it, partly, to the
impayring of Havens, which in many
places have impoverisht those Towns,
whose estate doth ebbe and flow with
them, and partly, to the dissolution of
Religious houses, by whose wealth and
haunt, many of those places were chief∣ly
fed and nourished. I meane not to
rehearse particular examples of euery
sort: for the thing it selfe speaketh, and
I haste to an end. As for Retaylors
thereof, and Handicrafts-men, it is no
marvell if they abandon Countrey
Townes, and resort to <HI>London:</HI> for not
onely the Court, which is now adayes
much greater, and more gallant than in
former times, and which was wont to
bee contented to remaine with a small
company, sometimes at an Abbey or
Priory, sometimes at a Bishops house,
and sometimes at some meane Mannor
of the Kings owne, is now for the most
part either abiding at <HI>London,</HI> or else so
neer unto it, that the provision of things
most fit for it, may easily bee setched
from thence: but also by occasion ther∣of,
the Gentlemen of all shires doe flye,
and flocke to this City, the yonger sort
of them to see and shew vanity, and the
<PB N="700" REF="365"/>
elder to save the cost and charge of hos∣pitality,
and house-keeping. For here∣by
it commeth to passe, that the Gen∣tlemen
being either for a good portion
of the yeere out of the Countrey, or
playing the Farmers, Grasiers, Brewers,
or such like, more than Gentlemen were
wont to doe within the Country, Re∣taylers
and Artificers, at the least of
such things as pertaine to the backe or
belly, doe leave the Country Townes,
where there is no vent, and doe flie to
<HI>London,</HI> where they be sure to finde rea∣dy
and quicke Market. And yet I wish
that even as many Townes in the Low-Countries
of King <HI>Philips</HI> doe stand
some by one handy Art, and some by
another: so also that it might bee pro∣vided
here, that the making of some
things, might (by discreet dispensation)
be allotted to some speciall Townes, to
the end, that although the daintinesse
of men cannot be restrained, which will
needs seeke those things at <HI>London,</HI> yet
other places also might bee relieved at
the least by the Workemanshippe of
them.</P>
<P>Thus much then of the estate of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
in the government thereof, in the
condition of the Cittizens, and in their
power and riches. Now follow the e∣numeration
of such benefits, as redound
to the Prince and this Realme by this
City: In which doing, I professe not to
rehearse all, but onely to recite and run
over the chiefe and principall of them.</P>
<P>Besides the commodities of the fur∣therance
of Religion, and Justice: The
propagation of Learning: The main∣tenance
of Arts: The increase of riches,
and the defence of Countries (all which
are before shewed to grow generally by
Cities, and be common to <HI>London</HI> with
them) <HI>London</HI> bringeth singularly these
good things following.</P>
<P>By advantage of the situation, it dis∣perseth
forrain Wares, (as the stomack
doth meat) to all the members most
commodiously.</P>
<P>By the benefit of the River of <HI>Thames</HI>
and great Trade of Merchandize, it is
the chiefe maker of Mariners, and
Nurse of our Navy and Ships, which (as
men know) bee the woodden walls for
defence of our Realme.</P>
<P>It maintaineth in flourishing estate,
the Countries of <HI>Norfolk, Suffolke, Essex,
Kent,</HI> and <HI>Sussex,</HI> which as they lye in
the face of our most puissant neighbor,
so ought they above others, to bee con∣served
in the greatest strength and ri∣ches:
and these, as it is well knowne,
stand not so much by the benefit of
their owne soile, as by the neighbour∣hood
and neerenesse which they have
to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>It relieveth plentifully, and with
good policy, not onely her owne poore
people, a thing which scarcely any o∣ther
Town or Shire doth, but also the
poore that from each quarter of the
Realme doe flocke unto it, and it im∣parteth
liberally to the necessity of the
Vniversities besides. It is an ornament
to the Realme by the beauty thereof,
and a terror to other Countries by rea∣son
of the great wealth and frequency.
It spreadeth the honour of our Country
farre abroad by her long Navigations,
and maketh our power feared, even of
barbarous Princes. It onely is stored
with rich Merchants, which sort onely
is tolerable: for beggerly Merchants
doe bite too neere, and will doe more
harme than good to the Realme.</P>
<P>It onely of any place in this Realme,
is able to furnish the sudden necessity
with a strong Army. It availeth the
Prince in Tronage, Poundage and
other his customes, much more than all
the rest of the Realme.</P>
<P>It yeeldeth a greater Subsidy than a∣ny
one part of the Realm, I mean not for
the proportion of the value of the goods
onely, but also for the faithfull service
there used, in making the assesse; for no
where else bee men taxed so neere to
their just value as in <HI>London:</HI> yea many
are found there, that for their counte∣nance
and credit sake, refuse not to bee
rated above their ability, which thing
never hapneth abroad in the country.
I omit that in ancient time, the Inhabi∣tants
of <HI>London</HI> and other Cities, were
accustomably taxed after the tenth of
their goods, when the Country was as∣sessed
at the fifteenth, and rated at the
eighth, when the Country was set at
the twelfth: for that were to awake a
sleeping dog, and I should be thought
<HI>dicenda, tacenda, locutus,</HI> as the Poet
said.</P>
<P><PB N="701" REF="365"/>
It onely doth, and is able to make the
Prince a ready prest or loane of mony.</P>
<P>It onely is found fit and able to en∣tertaine
strangers honourably, and to
receive the Prince of the Realme wor∣thily.</P>
<P>Almighty God <HI>(qui nisi custodiat Ci∣vitatem,

his Majesty evermore rightly esteeme
and rule this City, and He give grace,
that the Citizens may answer duty, as∣well

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>An Appendix containing the examination of such
causes, as have heretofore moved the Princes, either
to fine and ransome the Citizens of LONDON, or to
seize the Liberties of the City it selfe.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hese all may be reduced to
these few heads: for either
the Citizens have adhered
in aid or armes, to such as
have warred upon the Prince, or they
have made tumult, and broken the
common peace at home: or they have
misbehaved themselves in point of go∣vernment
and justice: or finally, and to
speak the plaine truth, the Princes have
taken hold of small matters, and coyned
good summes of money out of them.</P>
<P>To the first head I will referre what∣soever
they have done, either in those
warres that happened betweene King
<HI>Stephen</HI> and <HI>Maud</HI> the Empresse, being
competitors of the Crown: or between
King <HI>Iohn</HI> and his Nobles assisting <HI>Lew∣es</HI>
the French Kings sonne when hee in∣vaded
the Realme: for it is apparent by
all Histories, that the Londoners were
not the movers of these wars, but were
onely used as instruments to maintaine
them. The like is to bee said of all the
offences that King <HI>Henry</HI> the third,
whose whole raigne was a continuall
warfare, conceived against this City,
concerning the bearing of Armour a∣gainst
him: for the first part of his reign
was spent in the continuation of those
warres that his Father had begun with
<HI>Lewes.</HI> And the rest of his life hee be∣stowed
in that contention, which was
commonly called The Barons wars. In
which Tragedy <HI>London,</HI> as it could not
be otherwise, had now and then a part,
and had many a snub at the Kings hand
for it. But in the end, when he had tri∣umphed
over <HI>Simon Mountford</HI> at Eve∣sham,
<HI>London</HI> felt it most tragicall: for
then he both seized their Liberties, and
sucked themselves dry: and yet <HI>Edict∣um
Kenelworth,</HI> made shortly after, hath
an honourable testimony for <HI>London,</HI>
saying, <HI>Te London laudamus, &amp;c.</HI> As for
the other offences that he tooke against
the Londoners, they pertaine to the o∣ther
parts of my division.</P>
<P>Next after this, against whom the
Londoners did put on armes, followeth
King <HI>Edward</HI> the second, who in the end
was deprived of his Kingdome, not by
their meanes, but by a generall defecti∣on,
both of his owne wife and sonne,
and almost of the whole Nobility and
Realme besides. In which trouble, that
furious assault &amp; slaughter, committed
by them upon the Bishop of Excester,
then Treasurer of the Realme, is to bee
imputed, partly to the sway of the time
wherewith they were carried, and part∣ly
to a private displeasure which they
had to the Bishop.</P>
<P>Finally, commeth to hand King <HI>Ri∣chard</HI>
the second: for these three onely
in all the Catalogue of our Kings, have
beene heavy Lords to <HI>London,</HI> who also
had much contention with his Nobili∣ty,
and was in the end deposed. But
whatsoever countenance and aide the
City of <HI>London</HI> brought to the warres
and uprores of that time, it is notori∣ously
true, that <HI>London</HI> never led the
Dance, but ever followed the Pipe of
the Nobility. To cloze up this first part
therefore I affirme, that in all the trou∣blesome
actions during the reigne of
these three Kings, as also in all that
<PB N="702" REF="366"/>
heaving in, and hurling out, that after∣ward
happened betweene King <HI>Henry</HI>
the sixth, and King <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth,
the City of London was many times a
friend and fautor, but never the first
motive or author of any intestine warre
or sedition.</P>
<P>In the second roome I place a couple
of tumultuous affraies, that chanced
in the daies of King <HI>Richard</HI> the first: The
one upon the day of his Coronation a∣gainst
the Jewes, which, contrary to the
Kings owne Proclamation, would needs
enter the Church to see him sacred, and
were therefore ctuelly handled by the
common people. The other was caused
by <HI>William</HI> with the long beard, who
after that hee had inflamed the poore
people against the richer sort, and was
called to answer for his fault, took Bow
Church for Sanctuary, and kept it Ca∣stle-like,
till he was fired out.</P>
<P>Here is a place also for the stoning to
death of a Gentleman, servant to the
halfe Brother of King <HI>Henry</HI> the third,
which had before provoked the Citi∣zens
to fury, by wounding divers of
them without any cause 1257. for the
riotous fray between the servants of the
Goldsmiths and the Taylors, 1268. for
the hurly burly and bloodshed between
the Londoners and the men of <HI>Westmin∣ster,</HI>
moved by the Youngmen upon an
occasion of a wrestling on Saint <HI>Iames</HI>
day, 1221. and made worse by one <HI>Con∣stantine</HI>
an ancient Citizen: for the
brawle and businesse that arose about a
Bakers loafe at Salisbury place 1391.
for the which and some other misde∣meanors,
King <HI>Richard</HI> the second was
so incensed by evill counsell against the
Londoners, that he determined to de∣stroy
them, and raze their City, and
for the fight that was betweene the Ci∣tizens
and Sanctuary men of Saint
<HI>Martins</HI> 1454. under King <HI>Henry</HI> the
sixth. And finally, for the misrule on
evill May day 1519. and for such other
like if there have beene any.</P>
<P>To the third head may bee referred
the seizer of their liberties, for a false
judgement given against a poore wid∣dow,
called <HI>Margaret Viel,</HI> 1246. The
two severall seizers in one yeere
1258. for false packing in collections of
money and other enormities: And fi∣nally,
the seizer made by King <HI>Edward</HI>
the first, for taking of bribes of the Ba∣kers
1285. But all this security in sei∣zing
and resuming of the liberties,
which was in old time the onely ordi∣nary
punishment was at length mitiga∣ted
by King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and King
<HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, in their statutes before
remembred.</P>
<P>In the last-place it and those offen∣ces,
which I repute rather taken than
given, and doe fall within the measure
of the Adage, <HI>Vt canē caedas, citò invenias
baculum:</HI> for King <HI>Iohn</HI> in the tenth of
his reigne deposed the Bailiffes of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
because they had bought up the
wheate in the Market, so that there was
not to serve his Purveyors. King <HI>Henry</HI>
the third his sonne compelled the Lon∣doners
to pay him 5000. pound, be∣cause
they had lent to <HI>Lewes</HI> the French
the like summe, of a good mind to dis∣patch
him out of their City and the
Realme, at such time as the Protectour
and the whole Nobility fell to compo∣sition
with him for his departure. And
the same King fined them at three thou∣sand
markes, for the escape of a priso∣ner
out of Newgate, of whom they took
no charge: for he was a Clarke, priso∣ner
to the Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> under the
custody of his owne servants; and as for
the place, it was onely borrowed of
the Londoners to serve that turne. Hi∣therto
of these things to this end, that
whatsoever misdemeanor shall bee
objected out of History against <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
the same may herein appeare,
both in his true place, and proper co∣lour.</P>

<P><HI>William Stephanides,</HI> or <HI>Fitz-Stephen,</HI> a Monke of Canterbury,

appeared in him a certaine light of a Gentleman-like disposition,
which promised many good things, afterward by him performed.
Such time as others spent in brawles and idle talke, hee imployed
in wholsome exercises for the honour of his Country, following
therein the example of <HI>Plato:</HI> and was very studious both in hu∣manity

<P>The City of <HI>London,</HI> his birth place, the most Noble of all

<HEAD>A
DESCRIPTION
OF THE MOST HONOV∣RABLE
CITY OF
LONDON.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The Situation thereof.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Mong the Noble Cities
of the World, honou∣red
by fame, the City
of LONDON is one,
the chiefe Seate of the
Kingdome of <HI>England,</HI> whose renowne
is spred abroad farre and neere, but
transporteth her wares and commodi∣ties
much further, and so advanceth her
greatnesse. It is happy by reason of
the Aires wholsomnesse, by Christi∣an
Religion, her munition also and
strength, the nature of the situation,
the honour of the Citizens, the chasti∣ty
of grave Matrones. Very pleasant
also with sports and pastimes, and re∣plenished
with Honourable Persona∣ges.
All which I thinke meet severally
to consider.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The temperatenesse of the Aire.</HEAD>
<P>IN this place, the calmnesse of the
Aire doth mollifie mens minds,
not corrupting them with venereall
lusts, but preserving them from savage
and rude behaviour, and seasons their
inclinations with a more ingenious
temper.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Religion.</HEAD>
<P>THere is in the Church of Saint
<HI>Paula</HI> Bishops See: It was for∣merly
Metropolitane, and as it
is thought, shall recover the said digni∣ty
againe, if the Citizens shall returne
backe into the Iland, except perhaps
the Archepiscopall title of Saint <HI>Tho∣mas</HI>
the Martyr, and his bodily pre∣sence,
doe perpetuate this honour to
<HI>Canterbury,</HI> where now his Reliques
are. But seeing Saint <HI>Thomas</HI> hath gra∣ced
both these Cities, namely, <HI>London</HI>
with his birth, and <HI>Canterbury</HI> with his
death; one place may alleage much
against the other for the beholding of
that Saint, and further additions to
their holinesse. Now, concerning the
worship of God in the Christian faith:
There are in <HI>London</HI> and in the Suburbs
13. Churches belonging to Covents,
besides 126. lesser Parish Churches.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the strength of the City.</HEAD>
<P>IT hath on the East part a Tower
Palatine large and strong, whose
Court and Walls are secured with
a very deepe foundation, the morter is
<PB N="710" REF="370"/>
tempered with the blood of beasts.
On the West side are two Castles well
fenced. The Wall of the City is high
and spacious, with seven gates, which
are made double every way, and on the
North side distinguished with Turrets.
Likewise on the South side, <HI>London</HI>
hath beene inclosed with Walls and
Towers, but the large River of Thames
being well stored with Fish, and in
which the Tide ebbes and flowes, by
continuance of time hath washed and
worne away those walls. Further, a∣bove
in the West part, the Kings Pa∣lace
is eminently seated upon the same
River, an incomparable building, ha∣ving
a Wall before it, and some Bull∣warks;
it is two miles from the City,
and a continuall Subvrbs doth lye be∣tweene.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Gardens.</HEAD>
<P>NEere to the houses of the Sub∣vrbs,
the Citizens have Gar∣dens
and Orchards planted
with trees, large, beautifull, and one
joyning to another.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Pasture and Tillage.</HEAD>
<P>ON the North side are Fields for
Pasture, and open Meadowes,
very pleasant, into which the
River-waters doe flow, and Mills are
turned about with a delightfull noise.
Next, lieth a great Forest, in which are
wooddy places, and Beasts for game.
In the Coverts whereof doe lurke the
Stag, the Bucke, the wilde Bore, and
the Bull. The arable Lands are no hun∣gry
pieces of gravell ground, but like
the rich fields of <HI>Asia,</HI> which bring
plentifull Corne, and fill the Barnes of
the owners with a dainty crop of the
fruits of <HI>Ceres.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of their Wells.</HEAD>
<P>THere are on the North part of
<HI>London</HI> principall Fountaines of
water, sweet, wholsome, and
cleare, streaming forth among the gli∣stering
pebble stones: In this number
Holy-well, Clerken-well, and Saint
<HI>Clements</HI> well, are of most note and fre∣quented
above the rest, when Schollers
and the youth of the City take the Aire
abroad in the Summer evenings. Cer∣tainly
the City is good, seeing it hath
a good Lord.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Citizens honour.</HEAD>
<P>THe Honour of this City con∣sists
in proper Men, brave Ar∣mour,
and multitude of Inha∣bitants.
In the fatall warres under King
<HI>Steven,</HI> there went out to a Master,
men fit for warre, esteemed to the
number of 20000. horsemen armed,
and 60000. footmen. The Citizens of
<HI>London</HI> are knowne in all places, and re∣spected
above all others, by their civill
Demeanour, their good Apparell, their
Table, and their Discourse.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of their Matrones.</HEAD>
<P>THe Matrones here may be paralleld
with the Sabine women.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of their Schooles.</HEAD>
<P>IN <HI>London</HI> three famous Schooles are
kept at three principall Churches,
which they retaine by priviledge
and ancient dignity. Notwithstanding
by favour of some persons, or Teachers,
who are knowne and well reputed for
their Philosophie; there are other
Schooles upon good will and suffe∣rance.
Vpon the Holydayes, assemblies
flocke together about the Church,
where the Master hath his abode. There
the Schollers dispute; some use demon∣strations,
others topicall and probable
arguments: Some practise Enthi∣mems,
others are better at perfect Syl∣logismes:
Some for a shew dispute,
and for exercising themselves, &amp; strive
like adversaries: Others for truth,
which is the grace of perfection. The
dissembling Sophisters turne Verba∣lists,
<PB N="711" REF="370"/>
and are magnified when they o∣verflow
in speech; some also are intrapt
with deceitfull arguments. Sometime
certaine Oratours, with Rhotoricall O∣rations,
speake handsomly to perswade,
being carefull to observe the precepts of
Art, who omit no matter contingent.
The Boyes of divers Schooles wrangle
together in versifying, and canvase the
principles of Grammar, as the rules of
the Preterperfect and Future Tenses.
Someafter an old custome of prating,
vse Rimes &amp; Epigram: these can free∣ly
quip their fellowes, suppressing their
names with a festinine and railing li∣berty:
these cast out most abusive jests,
and with Socraticall witnesses either
they give a touch at the vices of Supe∣riours,
or fall upon them with a Saty∣ricall
bitternesse. The hearers prepare
for laughter, and make themselves mer∣ry
in the meane time.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>How the Affaires of the City
are disposed.</HEAD>
<P>SEverall Craftmen, and sellers of
Wares, and Workemen for hire,
all are distinguished every mor∣ning
by themselves, both in their pla∣ces
and imploiments. Besides, there is
in <HI>London</HI> upon the Rivers banke, a pub∣like
place of Cookery, betweene the
Ships laden with Wine, and the
Wines laid up in Cellers to bee sold:
there ye may call for any dish of meat,
rost, fried, or sodden, Fish both small
and great, ordinary flesh for the poo∣rer
sort, and more dainty for the rich,
as Venison and Fowle. If friends come
upon a sudden, wearied with travell, to
a Citizens house, and they be loth to
wait for curious preparations, and dres∣sings
of fresh meat, the servants give
them Water to wash, and Bread to
stay their stomacke, and in the meane
time goe to the water side, where all
things are at hand answerable to their
desire. Whatsoever multitude, either
of Souldiers or other strangers, enter
into the City at any houre, day or
night, or elle are about to depart, they
may turne in, bait there, and refresh
themselves to their content, and so a∣void
long fasting, and not goe away
without their dinner. If any desire to
fit their dainty tooth, they need not
to long for the Accipenser, or any o∣ther
Bird; no not the rare Godwit of
<HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nia.</HI> This publike victualing place
is very convenient, and belongs to the
City. Hereupon we reade in <HI>Platoes
Gorgias,</HI> that the office of Cookes is
neere to Physicke, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>latrery of
dissemblers is the fourth part of civi∣lity.
Without one of the gates is a cer∣taine
field, plaine both in name and
situation. Every Fryday, except some
Festivall come in the way there is a
great market of horses: some come out
of the City to buy or looke on, Earles,
Barons, Knights, and many Citizens
resort thither. It is a pleasant sight
there to behold the Nags to jog on
with an ambling pace, and their feet
on either side up and downe together
by turnes, or else cro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing horses which
are more convenient for men that beare
armes; these although they set a little
harder, goe away readily, and lite up
and set downe together the contrary
feet on either side. Here are also young
Colts of a good breed, that have not
beene well accustomed to the bridle;
these fling about, and by mounting
bravely, shew their mettle. Here are
principall horses, strong and well-lim∣med.
Here also are brest horses, fit
to bee joyned by couples, very faire
and handsome, and sleeke about the
eares, carrying their necks aloft, be∣ing
well flesht, and round about the
buttocks.</P>
<P>The buyers at first looke at their soft
and slow pace, and after cause them to
put on with more speed, and behold
them in their gallop. When these
Coursers are ready to runne their race,
and perhaps some others, which in their
kinde are both good for carriage and
strong for travaile: The people give a
shout, and the common Hackneys are
commanded to go aside The boyes that
ride, make matches among themselves,
two and two together, being expert
in governing their horses, which they
rule and curbe with a sharpe bridle,
labouring by all meanes that one get
not before the other. And the very
beasts, after their fashion, doe not cease
to strive, while their joynts tremble,
<PB N="712" REF="371"/>
and impatient of delay, endure not
standing still in a place. When the to∣ken
is given, they stretch out their bo∣dies
and runne speedily away, the Ri∣ders
spurring them on for the love of
praise, or hope of victory. You would
thinke every thing were in motion
with <HI>Heraclitus,</HI> and <HI>Zenoes</HI> opinion to
bee false, saying that nothing moves
from place to place. In another part
stand the country people with Cattell,
and commodities of the field, large
Swine, and Kine with their Vdders
strutting out, faire bodied Oxen and
Sheepe. There are also Cart-horses fit
for the Dray, or the Plough, and some
Mares big with Foale, together with o∣thers
that have their wanton Colts
following them close at their side.</P>
<P>To this City Merchants bring in
Wares frō every Nation under heaven:
The Arabian sends his Gold; the Sabe∣an
his Frankincense &amp; other Drugs; the
Scythian his provision frō the plentifull
wood of Date trees; Babylon bestowes
the fruits of a fertile soile; and Ny∣lus
his precious stones; the Seres send
Purple garments; they of Norway and
Russia, Trowts, Furs, and Sables. Ac∣cording
to the report of Chronicles, it
is more ancient then the City of Rome:
for both being descended from the
same Trojan stocke, <HI>Brute</HI> builded this,
before <HI>Remus</HI> and <HI>Romulus</HI> the other.
Whereupon it comes to passe, that their
ancient Lawes doe so agree: For this
our City is distinguished by Wards
and severall limits; it hath Sheriffes
every yeere, answerable to their Con∣suls;
it hath Aldermen, enjoying the
dignity of Senators, besides inferiour
Magistrates; it hath also Conduits and
conveyances for water in the streets.
Concerning causes in question; there
are severall places and Courts for mat∣ters
Deliberative, Demonstrative, and
Judiciall: upon set dayes also they have
their Common Councell and great As∣semblies.
I thinke there is no City that
hath more approved Customes, for
frequenting the Churches, for honou∣ring
Gods Ordinances observing of
Holy-dayes, giving Almes, entertai∣ning
Strangers, confirmation of Con∣tracts,
making up and celebrating of
Marriages, setting out of Feasts, wel∣comming
the Guests; and moreover,
in funerall rites, and burying of the
dead. The only plagues of <HI>London</HI> are
immoderate drinking of idle fellowes,
and often fires. Moreover, almost all
Bishops, Abbots, and Noble men of
<HI>England,</HI> are as it were, Citizens and
Free-men of <HI>London;</HI> there they have
faire dwellings, and thither they doe
often resort, and are called into the
City to Consultations and solemne
meetings, either by the King, or their
Metropolitane, or drawne by the peo∣ples
affaires.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Exercise and Pastimes.</HEAD>
<P>LEt us also come at last to their
Sports and Exercises; for it is
expedient that a City bee not
onely commodious for gaine, and seri∣ous,
but also pleasant and delightfull.
Therefore to the time of Pope <HI>Leo,</HI> the
Popes gave in their Seales, on one side
of their Bull, Saint <HI>Peter</HI> like a Fisher∣man,
and over him a Key reached forth
to him as it were from Heaven by the
hand of God, and this verse about it:
<Q><L>For me thy Ship</L>
<L>thou didst forsake,</L>
<L>Therefore the Key</L>
<L>of Heaven take.</L></Q></P>
<P>On the other part was stamped a City
with this Inscription, <HI>Golden Rome.</HI> Also
this was written to the praise of <HI>Caesar</HI></P>
<L>Augustus, <HI>and</HI> Rome:</L>
<L>All night the Sky distils</L>
<L>downe watry showeres,</L>
<L>The morning cleeres againe</L>
<L>to shew the play.</L>
<L><HI>Great</HI> Iove <HI>and</HI> Caesar</L>
<L>have their severall houres,</L>
<L>And in this Vniverse</L>
<L>by turnes beare sway.</L>
<P><HI>London,</HI> in stead of common Enter∣ludes
belonging to the Theatre, hath
plaies of a more holy subject, represen∣tations
of those miracles which the
holy Confessors wrought, or of the suf∣ferings
wherein the glorious constancy
of Martyrs did appeare. Besides that,
wee may beginne with the Schooles of
youth, seeing once wee were all chil∣dren;
Yeerely at Shrovetide the Boyes
of every Schoole bring fighting Cocks
<PB N="713" REF="371"/>
to their Masters, and all the forenoone
is spent at Schoole, to see these Cockes
fight together. After dinner, all the
youth of the City goeth to play at the
Ball in the fields, the Schollers of eve∣ry
Schoole have their Balls. The tea∣chers
also that traine up others in seats
and exercises, have every one their Ball
in their hands. The ancient and weal∣thy
Citizens come on horsebacke to see
these yongsters contending at their
sport, with whom in a manner they
participate by motion, stirring their
owne naturall heat in the view of
youth, with whose mirth and liberty
they seeme to communicate. Every
Sunday in Lent, after dinner, a com∣pany
of young men ride out into the
fields on horses which are fit for warre,
and principall runners: every horse a∣mong
them is taught to run his rounds.
The Citizens sonnes issue out thorow
the gates by troupes, furnished with
Lances and warlike Shields: the yon∣ger
sort have their Pikes not headed
with yron, where they make a repre∣sentation
of battell: There resort to
this exercise many Courtiers, when the
King lies neere-hand, and young strip∣lings
out of the families of Barons and
great persons, which have not yet at∣tained
to the warlike Girdle, doe traine
and skirmish. Hope of victory inflames
every one: the neighing and fierce hor∣ses
bestir their joynts, and chew their
bridles, and cannot indure to stand
still; at last they beginne their race,
and then the yong men divide their
troupes; some labour to outstrip their
leaders, and cannot reach them; others
fling downe their fellowes, and get
beyond them. In Easter Holy-dayes
they counterfeit a Sea-sight: a Pole is
set up in the middle of the River, with
a Target well fastened thereon, and a
yong man stands in a Boat which is
rowed with Oares, and driven on with
the tide, who with his Speare hits the
Target in his passage; with which
blow, if he breake the Speare, and stand
vpright, so that hee hold footing, hee
hath his desire: but if his Speare con∣tinue
unbroken by the blow, hee is
tumbled into the water, and his Boat
passeth cleere away: but on either side
this Target, two Ships stand in Ward,
with many yong men ready to tak
him up after he is sunke: assoone as he
appeareth againe on the top of the
water; the spectators stand upon the
Bridge, and other convenient places
about the River to behold these things,
being prepared for laughter. Vpon
the Holy-dayes, the youth is exercised
all Summer, in Leaping, Shooting,
Wrestling, casting of Stones, and
throwing of Javelins fitted with loopes
for the purpose, which they strive to
fling beyond the marke; they also use
Bucklers, like fighting men. As for
the Maidens, they have their exercise
of Dancing. In Winter, almost every
Holy-day before dinner, the foaming
Bores fight for their heads, and pre∣pare
with deadly Tushes to bee made
Bacon; or else some lusty Bulls, or huge
Beares, are baited with Dogs. When
that great Moorish Lake at the North
part of the City wall is frozen over,
great companies of young men goe to
sport upon th yee, then fetching a
runne, and setting their feet at a di∣stance,
and placing their bodies side∣wise,
they slide a great way. Others
take heapes of yee, as if it were great
Mil-stones, and make seats: many go∣ing
before, draw him that sits thereon,
holding one another by the hand; in
going so fast, sometime they all fall
downe together: some are better pra∣ctised
to the yee, and binde to their
shooes, Bones, as the legs of some
beasts, and hold Stakes in their hands,
headed with sharpe yron, which some∣times
they strike against the yee; and
these men goe on with such speed, as
doth a Bird in the Aire, or Darts shot
from some warlike Engine: sometime
two men set themselves at a distance,
and runne one against another, as it
were at tilt, with these Stakes, where∣with
one or both parties are throwne
downe, not without some hurt to their
bodies; and after their fall, by reason
of the violent motion, are carried a
good distance one from another: and
wheresoever the yee doth touch their
head, it rubs off the skin and bruiseth it:
and if one fall upon his leg or his arme,
it is usually broken: But young men
being greedy of honour, and desirous
of victory, doe thus exercise them∣selves
<PB N="714" REF="372"/>
in counterfeit battels, that they
may beare the brunt more strongly,
when they come to it in good earnest.
Many Citizens take delight in Birds,
as Spar-hawkes, Gosse-hawkes, and
such like, and in Dogs to hunt in the
wooddy ground. The Citizens have
authority to hunt in <HI>Middlesex, Hert∣fordshire,</HI>
all the Chilterns, and in <HI>Kent,</HI>
as farre as Gray-water. The Londo∣ners,
once called Trinovants, repulsed
<HI>C. Iulius Caesar,</HI> who commonly pa∣ved
his way with blood: whereupon
<HI>Lucan;</HI></P>
<Q><L>He was afraid,</L>
<L>and foil'd by Britons hand,</L>
<L>That first presumed</L>
<L>to invade their land.</L></Q>
<P>The City of <HI>London</HI> can bring out
some who subdued many Kingdomes,
and the Empire of <HI>Rome,</HI> and many o∣thers
who (being great Lords heires)
were deified in another world: as <HI>A∣polloes</HI>
Oracle did promise <HI>Brute:</HI></P>
<Q><L><HI>Brute,</HI> thou shalt finde</L>
<L>an Iland in the West,</L>
<L>Beyond the <HI>Gaules,</HI></L>
<L>environ'd with the maine;</L>
<L>Direct thy journey</L>
<L>thither for thy rest,</L>
<L>And there a second Troy</L>
<L>shall rise againe.</L>
<L>Kings from thy Hieres,</L>
<L>and Conquerours shall spring.</L>
<L>Who will the world</L>
<L>into subjection bring.</L></Q>
<P>In the times of Christianity, it brought
forth the Noble Emperour <HI>Constan∣tine,</HI>
who gave the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> and
all the Imperiall Armes to God, and to
Saint <HI>Peter,</HI> and <HI>Silvester</HI> the Pope,
whose Stirrop hee refused not to hold,
and pleased rather to be called, Defen∣dour
of the holy Romane Church, than
Emperour any more. And lest the
peace of our Lord the Pope should suf∣fer
any disturbance, by the noise of se∣cular
affaires, he left the City, and be∣stowed
it on the Pope, and founded
the City of <HI>Constantinople</HI> for his owne
habitation. <HI>London</HI> also in these latter
times hath brought forth famous and
magnificent Governours; <HI>Maud</HI> the
Empresse, <HI>Henry</HI> the third, King, and
<HI>Thomas</HI> the Archbishop, a glorious
Martyr of Christ, then whom no man
was more innocent, or more devoted to

Thomas Archibishop of Canter∣bury,
had shewed that he had found as
he Rode in his visitation, that one Ro∣ger,

<HEAD>Of the ancient Court of the Hustings.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Finde it diversly written
in Latine, <HI>Hustingum,
Hustingus, Hustingia,</HI> and
sometimes (but falsely)
<HI>Hustangus.</HI> It is the an∣cientest
and the highest
Court of Justice, of the famous City of
<HI>London.</HI> The name it takes from the
place of keeping that Court (as <HI>Pryta∣neum</HI>
did at <HI>Athens)</HI> for <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (hus) among
the old Saxons, signified an house, and

that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Husthing,</HI> signified the
house of Causes or Pleadings: where∣upon
in the Saxon tongue <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
<HI>Thingere, Thingarius,</HI> signified an Ad∣vocate
or Lawyer: which others would
perchance derive rather from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>thung,</HI> or <HI>gedhung,</HI> which signifi∣ed
Honourable, for that the most hono∣rable
Magistrates of the City, held their
Court there; like as the Lord Maior
and Sheriffes, and in absence of the
Sheriffes, sixe of the Aldermen at this
day doe.</P>
<P>The Antiquity of this famous Court
of <HI>Hustings,</HI> is much magnified by the
Compiler of King <HI>Edwards</HI> Lawes, cap.
35. in these words: There ought al∣wayes
in the City of <HI>London,</HI> which is
the head City of the Kingdome and of
the Lawes, to bee held upon every<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">This is altered unto Tues∣day, be∣cause of the She∣riffes in∣tending of the Mar∣kets: which being kept upō Mun∣day, would hinder their sit∣ting in the <HI>Hustings.</HI></NOTE>
Munday weekely, a Court of our So∣veraigne
Lord the King, at the <HI>Hust∣stings.</HI>
This Court was founded and
built of old, after the fashion and man∣ner,
yea and in the memory of the an∣cient
City of <HI>Troy:</HI> and even unto this
day containes it within it selfe the
Lawes, and rights, and dignities, liber∣ties,
and customes Royall of that anci∣ent
and great <HI>Troy.</HI> There be handled
the intricatest<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg"><HI>Compta</HI> perchance the word signifies Measures rather thā Accounts: for <HI>Compotus ager,</HI> is a field surveighed, whose quan∣tities were set downe in the Land marke or Terrier: and here perchance was kept a generall surveigh of all the Lands of the Kingdome, as now in the Domes-day Booke in the Exchequer. The forme whereof, the Conquerour perchance tooke from the <HI>Hustings.</HI></NOTE> accounts and the
doubtfull Pleas of the Crowne, and of
the Court of our Lord the King, of the
whole Kingdome aforesaid: and this
Court hath even to this day preserved
<PB N="768" REF="399"/>
her owne ancient Customes most invi∣olably.
Thus farre my Author, who
(by his leave) smels too rankly of that
Fabler, <HI>Geffery</HI> of <HI>Munmouth.</HI></P>
<P>And yet something there is in the
<HI>Hustings,</HI> which might give counte∣nance
to this comparison of old <HI>Troy,</HI>
namely, that the well-knowne weight
used for Gold and Silver, called <HI>Troy-weight,</HI>
was in time of the Saxons cal∣led,
<HI>The Hustings weight of London,</HI> and
kept there in the <HI>Hustings.</HI> So an ancient
Record in the booke of <HI>Ramsey, Sect.</HI> 32
and 127. I <HI>Aethelgina</HI> Countesse, &amp;c.
bequeath two silver Cups of twelve
markes of the <HI>Hustings</HI> weight of <HI>Lon∣don.</HI></P>
<P>The former Law of the said King <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>
the Confessor, commands the
<HI>Hustings</HI> Court to be held every Mun∣day,
though at this day it be held upon
the Tuesday: which that it may not
be perceived by the Monuments and
Rolls of the Court, to have differed
too much from the first Institution, is
yet said and written, to be holden upon
the Munday. It is as it were distingui∣shed
into two Courts: for one weeke
the Iudges sit upon Pleas meerely
reall, and the next weeke upon Acti∣ons
mixt, or of any other nature what∣soever.</P>
<P>Out of the same Booke of Ramsey
Abbey, Sect. 268. will I here set down
the ancient forme of purchasing and gi∣ving
of possession used in the <HI>Hustings:</HI>
which is farre different from the fashi∣on
used at this day. Be it knowne unto
all the sonnes of holy Church, that
<HI>Wlfnoth</HI> of <HI>Walebroc, London,</HI> have sold
unto <HI>Reynold,</HI> Abbot of <HI>Ramsey,</HI> a cer∣taine
piece of land which hee had<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Super Walbroc.</NOTE> in
<HI>Walebroc,</HI> whence he was called <HI>Wlf∣noth</HI>
of <HI>Walbroc.</HI> As also a certaine house
of stone, and a Shop which hee had
built upon that land, with doores of
yron, and windowes above and be∣neath,
&amp;c. Which said <HI>Wlfnoth</HI> hath
sold that Land unto the Abbot of <HI>Ram∣sey,</HI>
and hath given him seisin of it, by
delivery of a certaine staffe, and hath
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Et clama∣vit solam &amp; quietam, &amp; abs{que} omni calumpnia.</NOTE> quite claimed unto it to all encumbrance:
quiet, and void of all encumbrance:
both he, and <HI>Mahald</HI> his Wife and his
first wives Daughter: and <HI>Mahald</HI> his
second Wife, and <HI>Henry</HI> his sonne by
his second wife, and <HI>Christine</HI> her
daughter, before the whole <HI>Husting</HI> of
<HI>London,</HI> in the house of <HI>Alfwine,</HI> sonne
of <HI>Leofstan:</HI> to bee held from this day
forth for ever by the Church of <HI>Ram∣sey,</HI>
in consideration of ten pounds
of pence, which hee gave unto him in
presence of the whole Court of <HI>Hu∣stings;</HI>
of which ten pounds, he the said
<HI>Wolfnoth</HI> gave forty shillings unto <HI>Maud</HI>
his daughter for her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Propter concessum suum.</HI> For giving up her right in it, per∣chance.</NOTE> good will, be∣cause
he had the Land by her Mother.
And the Abbot for his part gave her
halfe a marke of silver; and unto <HI>Wlf∣noths</HI>
Wife, and other two children, for
their good wills, he gave five shillings.
Of this bargaine and sale, be on the part
of the <HI>Hustings</HI> these witnesses, <HI>William</HI>
of <HI>Einesford,</HI> Sheriffe of <HI>London,</HI> and
<HI>Iohn</HI> his Vnder-Sheriffe, and <HI>Gervase</HI>
his Clarke; <HI>Andrew Bucuint,</HI> and <HI>Ralfe</HI>
his sonne, and <HI>Ralfe</HI> his cousin; <HI>Gilbert
Proudfoot, William Bukerell,</HI> and many
others.</P>
<P>This deed hath no date mentioned,
but I finde this <HI>Reinold</HI> to have beene
made Abbot of <HI>Ramsey,</HI> by King <HI>Henry</HI>
the first as his Charter shewes, <HI>Sect.
214.</HI> The Successor to this <HI>Reinold</HI> was
one <HI>Walter</HI> but what yeere he was made
Abbot in, I finde not; but I finde that
he flourished <HI>Anno,</HI> 1149. that is, the
fourteenth yeere of King <HI>Stephen.</HI> By
this may you judge of the antiquity of
the deed, though the precise day be not
dated.</P>
<P>By this passage it cleerely appeareth,
that <HI>London</HI> was honoured with her
Sheriffes Office, even in the age of
King <HI>Henry</HI> the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Which was above 500. yeers since.</NOTE> first, although our
Chroniclers affirme the Sheriffes to be
made first by King <HI>Richard</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Which was almost 100. yeeres after.</NOTE> the first,
at his comming to the Crowne: from
whose time our said Chroniclers begin
to reckon the first Maior and Sheriffes,
that is, from the yere of our Lord 1189.
But that the Sheriffes were granted
unto the City, together with the Coun∣ty
of <HI>Middlesex,</HI> plainely appeares by
the said Kings Charter concerning the
liberties of <HI>London,</HI> given in the begin∣ning
of his Raigne: nor doe the Maior
and Sheriffes much differ from those
former Magistrates of the City, the
<HI>Portreve,</HI> and <HI>Provost,</HI> as might bee
proved.</P>
<P><PB N="769" REF="399"/>
Moreover, the Cities, of <HI>Yorke, Win∣chester,
Lincolne,</HI> the Ile of <HI>Shepey,</HI> with

said to have had their <HI>Hustings.</HI> See

an Act of Common

that the Lord Maior

and determine all matters brought be∣fore
them betweene party and party,
(being Citizens and Freemen of <HI>Lon∣don)</HI>
in all cases where the due debt or
damage did not exceed forty shillings.</P>
<P>This Act was to continue but for two

not able to make present payment of
their debts;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The rea∣sons why the said Court hath had continu∣ation.</NOTE> and to restraine malicious

not able to prosecute Suits in Law for
the same elsewhere:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Acts made since to the same purpose.</NOTE> The same Act
hath sithence bin continued by divers
other Acts of Common Councell: and
hereby (besides the said two Aldermen
monthly assigned) the number of Com∣missioners
were increased, from foure
to twelve. And so by that Authority,
the same Court continued till the end
of the Raigne of Queene <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And then divers people, being Ci∣tizens
and Freemen of <HI>London</HI> (contrary
to their Oathes formerly taken) repi∣ning
at the authority of the same court,
and not regarding the expence of any
charges how great soever, so they might
have their desires upon their poore
Debtors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mali∣cious pro∣ceeding of cruell Creditors against poore men that claimed the benefit of the Court.</NOTE> and being often animated
thereunto by divers Attorneys and So∣licitors
(for their owne particular

such petty debts and causes against
poore men (Citizens and Freemen of
<HI>London)</HI> in the high Courts at <HI>West∣minster,</HI>
or else-where out of the said
Court of Requests, to avoid the juris∣diction
of the same Court, and to barre
the said Commissioners from staying
such Suits, and examining the said cau∣ses,
and thereby caused the said poore
men many times to pay sixe times as
much charges as their principall debts
or damage did amount unto, to the un∣doing
of such poore men, their wives
and children, and also to the filling of
the Prisons with the poore so sued:
where otherwise they might have got
their Debts in the said Court of Re∣quests,
for very small charge and little
trouble.</P>
<P>For remedy whereof, &amp; for the streng∣thening
&amp; establishing the said Court,
an Act of Parliament was then made in

cause such Debtors to be warned to ap∣peare

them, should from time to time set
downe such orders betweene such par∣ties,
Plantiffe and Defendant, Credi∣tor
and Debtor, touching such debts
not exceeding forty shillings, as they
should finde to stand with equity and
good conscience.</P>
<P>But sithence the making of that Act,
divers persons (intending to subvert the
good and charitable intent of the same)
<PB N="770" REF="400"/>
have taken hold of some doubtfull and
ambiguous words therein, and have
wrested the same for their owne lucre

establishing and strengthening of

the tenth of August, 1626. The Am∣bassadour
himselfe, young <HI>Shawsware</HI>
his sonne, and many other Persians,
(with many expressions of their infi∣nite
love and sorrow) following him to
the ground betweene eight and nine of
the clocke in the morning. The rites
and ceremonies that (with them) are
due to the dead, were chiefly perfor∣med
by his sonne, who sitting crosse∣legged
at the North end of the grave,
(for his Tombe stands North and
South) did one while Reade, another
while Sing; his Reading and Singing
intermixt with sighing and weeping.
And this, with other things that were
done in the Grave in private (to pre∣vent

about halfe an houre.</P>
<P>But this was but this dayes businesse:
for, as this had not beene enough to

at sixe and sixe, for the space of a

other, they met not so happily here to
preach, as in the matter upon which
they did preach: for though their Texts
were severall, their subject was one and
the same, this is worthy our observa∣tion;
yet to make it worth admiration,
and a perpetuall memory, wee are to
take notice, how upon that one and the
same subject, they did precede and suc∣ceed
one the other like the linkes in a
golden chaine, the second beginning
where the first ended, and the third
where the second ended; the last abso∣lutely
concluding what the two former

<HEAD>A briefe Relation of that lamentable Fire, that hapned
on London Bridge, the 13. of February 1633.</HEAD>
<P>FRom this let us turne, our eyes up∣on
that lamentable Fire upon <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
bridge, that upon Monday the
13. of February, 1633. betweene ele∣ven
and twelve towards midnight gave
us ashes in stead of Beauty: the ashes,
into which the third part of the Bridge
was consum'd, for the beautifull Frames
so consumed.</P>
<P>The number of the houses then burnt
on both sides the Bridge, from the
Church called Saint <HI>Magnus,</HI> to the
first open place, were two and for∣ty;
all which (with a great part of
their wares, the goods, and rich furni∣ture
in them) were devoured to the
ground (though many hands, much la∣bour,
with a great deale of feare and
danger, were carefully employed to
prevent it) before eight of the clocke
the next morning. Thus suddenly they
were burnt to the ground, all above
ground quencht and extinguisht, but
beneath in their Vaults and Cellars, the
fire remained glowing and burning for
the space of a whole weeke after.</P>
<P>The house in which it began was the
house of one Master <HI>Brigs</HI> (at the hither
end of the Bridge) a Needle-maker:
but now it beganne, because divesly
spoken by many, I would not set downe
from any.</P>
<P>The losse was great and sudden, pre∣senting
(as a glasse) the length of a
lease or of life, when such a sad chance
shall betide us. Though getting a long
lease of our lands, we presume of a lease
of our lives, of a long and secure pos∣session;
like those in the 4. of <HI>Iames,</HI>
that say, <HI>To day or to morrow we will goe
into such a City, and continue there for a
yeere, and buy, and sell, and get money.</HI>
They will goe, they will stay, they will
get, such losses as these never thought
on; though the same Prophet (in
the same place) tell them, <HI>They know
not what the morrow may bring with
it.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A RETVRNE
TO
LONDON:</HEAD>
<P>In which most of the Parish Churches have of late
yeeres beene Rebuilded, Repaired, or at
least Beautified.</P>
<P>A Catalogue whereof here followeth, wherein not only the
yeere in which, but the meanes likewise by which, each Worke was
perfected are set downe, as also all the Monuments of Queene
<HI>Elizabeth,</HI> as they are in every Church.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>S. Albanes Woodstreet.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Am sorry, that, but now
beginning to speake of
Building, repairing, and
Beautifying of all the
Parish Churches in this
famous City of <HI>London,</HI>
I must in the very Front of the Alpha∣bet
(for that is the rule I goe by) speake
of the pulling downe, Demolishment,
and Ruines of a Church, and one of the
most ancient among them; Saint <HI>Al∣banes</HI>
in Woodstreet.</P>
<P>This Church, being wonderfully
decayed and perished, was by these
Gentlemen, Sir <HI>Henry Spiller, Enigo
Iones,</HI> Esquire, Captaine <HI>Leake,</HI> and
Captaine <HI>Williams</HI> surveyed, to see
what repaire might helpe it. But by
these Gentlemen, and Workemen ap∣pointed
with them, it was found to be
too farre gone for Repaire; neither
would any Workeman put himselfe
into hazard upon it: affirming it to be
in every part of it, so spent, decayed,
and enfeebled, that they must sudden∣ly
plucke it downe, or it would sudden∣ly
prevent that labour, and fall to the
ground of it selfe: which the Fallings
every day encreasing (and more and
more growing and appearing) did most
evidently seeme to threaten.</P>
<P>For this cause, many of the Parish∣oners
refused to goe to it, many that
went, went unwillingly, but all with
much feare, where they sate with
more; their danger all the time much
troubling and disturbing their De∣votion.</P>
<P>This great necessity inforcing, it
was the last yeere 1632. betwixt Ea∣ster
and Midsummer pul'd downe, and
yet Iuly, 1633. (a sad object) so lies
in its pitifull ruines.</P>
<P>Many of the ablest sort of this Pa∣rish,
to shew they would doe what
they could towards the recovery of
<PB N="820" REF="424"/>
this great losse, have joyned certaine
monies (their free and voluntary gifts)
together, which they have againe dis∣bursed
in Stone, and some other Ma∣terials.</P>
<P>But this many, being but few, to the
number of those that in this kind, can
doe little or nothing, and their good
wills falling extremely short of that
great summe that must beginne and
finish so great a Worke as this, they
were constrained to petition his High∣nesse
for his Letters Patents, for the
helpe of a collection for it.</P>
<P>Their Petition graciously received,
his Majesty was pleased (as a cause of
all other his Piety especially favours)
to send his Letter to the Lord Bishop
of <HI>London,</HI> for the forwarding and ef∣fecting
their desires.</P>
<P>Yet notwithstanding this faire de∣gree
to their wish, they are for a time
put off, by reason (as I am informed)
of the great Collection for the repaire
of the famous Cathedrall Church of
Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> but they hope it will not
be long.</P>
<P>In which hope they have many Part∣ners,
as also in their Prayers, for all the
good meanes that may be, to the spee∣dy
rebuilding of it; till which time,
the Church appointed unto them for
the Sabbath. Exercises, Marriage, Bu∣rying,
Churching, and the Sacra∣ments,
is the Parish Church of Saint
<HI>Alphage</HI> neere Cripplegate. And thus
much of this Church, Saint <HI>Albanes.</HI></P>

<P>THe ancient Church belonging
to the <HI>Black-Fryers, London,</HI> was
(before the dissolution of Re∣ligious
Houses by <HI>Henry</HI> the 8.) one
<PB N="826" REF="427"/>
of the most spacious and faire Chur∣ches
in <HI>London:</HI> but the Friers being
put out, the Church (together with
other faire buildings) was utterly de∣molished.
Therefore the Inhabitants
of the said <HI>Black-Fryers, London,</HI> fitted
an upper Roome, of 50. foot in length,
and 30. foot in breadth, for a publike
place of Divine worship. The char∣ges
of purchasing and fitting the said
Roome for a Church, appeareth not
in any Record that we can finde.</P>
<P>In <HI>Anno</HI> 1597. when the Church
was empty, and no body in it, a great
part of the Roofe thereof fell downe,
whereupon the then Inhabitants being
about to repaire their said Church, ob∣tained
of Sir <HI>George Moore</HI> Knight, so
much ground as enlarged their Church
with an Ile on the West, 50. foot in
length and 15. foot in breadth: for
which ground they built at their owne
cost a faire Ware-house under the said
Ile for the use of Sir <HI>Ierome Bows,</HI>
Knight, who then had the said ground
in lease, and also gave him 133. li.
The new building of their said Church
and Ile (beside the foresaid 133. li. gi∣ven
to Sir <HI>Ierom Bows)</HI> cost 300. li.
18. shillings.</P>
<P>In Iune 1607. the Inhabitants of
the said <HI>Black-Fryers</HI> paid 120. li. to
Sir <HI>George Moore,</HI> for the purchase of
their Preachers house, their Church-yard,
their Church, and the Porch ap∣pertaining
thereunto, together with
the right of Patronage of, in, and to
the said Church.</P>
<P>In <HI>Anno</HI> 1613. the Inhabitants of
the said <HI>Black-Fryers,</HI> purchased on the
South of their Church, so much hou∣sing
as enlarged their Church afore∣said
36. foot in length and 54. foot
in bredth, the purchase whereof, toge∣ther
with the Vault for burying, and
other Roomes under that part of the
Church, and the new building of all,
and making new Pewes, and Pulpit,
cost 1546. li. 6. shillings.</P>
<P>In <HI>Anno</HI> 1632. the Inhabitants of
the said <HI>Black-Fryers,</HI> purchased the
Roomes directly under the above men∣tioned
upper Roome converted to a
Church, which said under Roomes
they purchased to repaire the Foun∣dation
&amp; Walls whereon the Church
stood, which Walls were very much
decayed. The Purchase whereof, and
repaire of Decayes, cost 500. li.</P>
<P>The summe of all bestowed upon

<P>THe foundation of this now fa∣mously
finished House of God,
was begun to be laid upon the
23. day of Iune, in the yeere of our
Lord God 1628.</P>
<P>The first Bricke, as also the first
Stone in this Foundation, was laid by
Master <HI>Martin Bond,</HI> of this Parish
Aldermans Deputy of the Ward, and
one of our City Captaines. The Bricke
was laid (as is aforesaid) the 23. of
Iune, and the Stone (a principall cor∣ner
Stone) the 28. of Iuly following.</P>
<P>Many of the Parishioners (follow∣ing
this worthy Leader) laid every
man his Stone, with which they layd
something else, which the Workemen
tooke up very thankfully.</P>
<P>On the backside of the North wall
of the old Church was a Cloister, the
breadth of it seven foot and above,
which Cloister, by the taking downe of
that wall, being taken into the Church,
gave it all its breadth to enlarge it.</P>
<P>In digging under this wall, there
was found the figure of halfe the face
of a man, cast in Lead, the Mould set∣ting
likewise upon it this word, <HI>Comes.</HI></P>
<P>Digging under the South Row of
Pillers, they found the scull of a man,
the thicknesse of which was three quar∣ters
of an inch and better, measured by
many, and admired by all that have
seene it.</P>
<P>At the West end of this Church
adjoyning to the Steeple, stands a
Pillar of the old Church, as it stood
and was there erected: This Piller
(from the Basis or foot, to the Chapi∣ter
or head, upon which the old Arch
was raised) being eighteene foot high,
and but three to bee seene above
ground, shewes the measure or height
to which the flore of this new Church
hath beene raised above that of the old,
which is, the hidden part of the Piller,
or the 15. foot of it buried.</P>
<P>This Structure, not of Bricke, but
built from the ground with the choi∣sest
Freestone might be got, without,
within, and in every part of it supply∣ed,
furnished, and inriched, with what∣soever
might adde to its greatest grace
and lustre, was finished in the yeere of
our Lord God, 1630.</P>
<P>In this yeere (accounting from
March to March) upon the 16. day of
Ianuary, it was consecrated by the
right Reverend Father in God, <HI>Wil.</HI>
Lord Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> and upon the
same day (as on such it is usuall with
us) were the Sacraments of the Lords
Supper, and the Sacrament of Bap∣tisme
administred.</P>
<P>In this Church the Pulpit and Com∣munion
Table are pure Cedar and

<P>In the yeere 1622. the inside of the

<P>In the yeere 1624. the Gallery at the
lower end of the Church, was rebuilded,
very much enlarged, and beautified.</P>
<P>In the yeeres of our Lord 1625. and
1626. great cost was bestowed in Lead,
and in the Plumbers labour.</P>
<P>In the yeere 1628. the Steeple of this
Church, being formerly part of Stone,
and part of Timber, the upper part e∣specially
Timber, being all ruined and
decayed, was pulled downe to the very
foundation, and a new re-builded of
Bricke and Free-stone, very richly and

<P>HOw this Church, any thing
in or about it (either for ne∣cessity
or beauty) hath from
time to time beene kept, supplyed, and
maintained, all men that know it know;
to the perpetuall credit and commends
of those worthy Gentlemen, to whom,
in their severall times and successi∣on,
the charge of it hath beene com∣mitted.</P>
<P>But to leave this generall commends,
and come to some particulars, with
their times, but a little time past, wee
begin with the yeere 1623. In which
all the Roofe over the Chancell, was
on the outside repaired, and in the
inside very curiously clouded.</P>
<P>To the further grace and ornament
of this Chancell, there was added in
the same yeere, the cost of a very faire
Table of the Commandements, and
with these the Church (then) was tho∣rowout
very worthily beautified.</P>
<P>In the yeeres of our Lord God, 1624.
and 1626. the two side Galleries were
built, both very faire and spacious.</P>
<P>In the yeere of our Lord, 1629. the
Steeple very much decayed, was repai∣red,
all the foure Spires (standing in
foure Towers at the corners of it) taken
downe, with new and very substantiall
Timber-worke re-built, and with the
Lead new cast new covered; every one
of these Spires inlarged somewhat in
the compasse, a great deale in height,
but most in their stately, eminent, and
gracefull appearance.</P>
<P>In the midst of these, where there
was none before (gracing and being
graced by them) was a very faire Tur∣ret
erected; the head of it (which
much overpeeres those Spires) covered
with Lead, as also the props that sup∣port
it: This, and the Spires, having
every one a Crosse, with very faire
Vanes upon them.</P>
<P>The charge of all this I could not
certainly get, and would not uncertain∣ly
speake it: But the greanesse of the
things speake the cost to be great, all
being the sole charge of the Parishio∣ners.</P>

<P>VPon this spacious and specious
Church (for well it deserves
those Epithites) we look back∣ward
twenty yeeres or thereupon, at
which time it was in many parts of it
repaired, and within thorowout richly
and very worthily beautified.</P>
<P>About two or three yeeres after,
that Gallery that is over that part of
the Church that is called Saint PE∣TERS
Chappell, and that that is
over against it, as also that Gallery
that crosses the middle Ile, over the
entrance into the Chancell (much
gracing the Church, and supplying a
<PB N="885" REF="456"/>
great necessity) were worthily contri∣ved
and erected.</P>
<P>In the yeeres of our Lord God, 1621.
and 1622. it was againe in many parts
of it repaired; all the North side of it
(at once) strengthened and beautified,
with a substantiall and very artificiall
Rough-cast, the other side Plaistered
and Whited.</P>
<P>Among many rich and beautifull
things that have beene added to this
Church at divers times, and to seve∣rall
parts and places, some of a generall
cost, and some of particular bounties
(for some reserved causes omitted) we
here only remember that extraordina∣ry
faire and curious Table of the Com∣mandements,
and the Screene at the
West doore, set up in the yeere of our
Lord God, 1618.</P>
<P>But passing all these, somewhat now
of that part of this Church above the
Chancell, that in former times was
called, <HI>Our Ladies Chappell.</HI></P>
<P>It is now called, <HI>The new Chappell;</HI>
and indeed, though very old, it now
may be cal'd a new one, because newly
redeemed from such use and imploy∣ment,
as in respect of that it was built
to, Divine and Religious duties, may
very well be branded, with the stile of
wretched, base, and unworthy, for that
that before this abuse, was (and is now)
a faire &amp; beautifull Chappell, by those
that were then the Corporation (which
is a body consisting of 30. Vestry men,
sixe of those thirty, Churchwardens)
was leased and let out, and this House
of God made a Bake-house.</P>
<P>Two very faire doores, that from the
two side Iles of the Chancell of this
Church, and two that thorow the
head of the Chancell (as at this day
they doe againe) went into it, were
lath't, daub'd, and dam d up: the faire
Pillars were ordinary posts, against
which they piled Billets and Bavens;
in this place they had their Ovens, in
that a Bolting-place, in that their
Kneading-trough, in another (I have
heard) a Hogs-trough; for the words
that were given mee were these, This
place have I knowne a Hog-stie, in a∣nother
a Store-house, to store up their
hoorded Meale: and in all of it, some∣thing
of this sordid kind &amp; condition.</P>
<P>It was first let by the Corporation
afore named, to one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Wyat,</HI> after
him to one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Peacocke,</HI> after him
to one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Cleybrooke,</HI> and last to one

Chappell still imployed in the way of
their Trade, a Bake-house, though some
part of this Bake-house was sometime
turned into a Starch-house.</P>
<P>The time of the continuance of it
in this kind, from the first letting of it
to <HI>Wyat,</HI> to the restoring of it againe to
the Church, was threescore and some
odde yeeres, in the yeere of our Lord
God 1624. for in this yeere the ruines
and blasted estate that the old Corpo∣ration
sold it to, were by the Corpora∣tion
of this time, repaired, renewed,
well, and very worthily beautified: the
charge of it for that yeere, with many
things done to it since, arising to two
hundred pounds.</P>
<P>This, as all the former Repaires, be∣ing
the sole cost and charge of the Pa∣rishioners.</P>

<P>BEfore I speake of this new
Church, I must briefly say of
the old, that indeed it was very
old: and in the antiquity of it, stood
now still in danger of falling: that some
part of it did fall, foretelling the rest to
follow, if not speedily prevented, by
pulling it downe to Re-build it, which
after a diligent search, the necessity
found, was done.</P>
<P>For this new Church, it beganne to
be raised in the yeere of our Lord God,
1623. was finished 1625. and encom∣past
with a faire bricke Wall in the
yeere 1631.</P>
<P>Which take more amply, in that
absolute delivery of it, that I finde en∣graven
over the doore on the North
side of this Church, the words are
these:</P>

To the raising, finishing, and (in eve∣ry
part of it) richly, and very excel∣lently
beautifying of this great worke,
there were many good and great Be∣nefactors:
The names of all, with their
particular gifts, my time gave not
leave to compasse: neither for many
of them, could any enquiry get them,
they desiring to bee conceald, and by
vertue of what they have done, obli∣ging
those that know them, not to di∣vulge
or reveale them.</P>

this Church, the Worke and Worke∣masters

<P>THere hath beene within these
few yeeres a great sum of mony
expended upon this Chruch,
by the sad and lamentable accidents of
twice the fall of the Steeple. Spea∣king
of which, I should say, the first in
such a yeere, such a moneth, such a day;
and as of that for the second: but my
Information (though given mee by a
very good friend) could by no meanes
make me so punctuall. Howsoever, it
was about the time afore dated; and
the second, within a little time after.</P>
<P>The first falling of this Steeple (or
part of it) was through the antiquity, or
length of time it had stood, without
any repaire or mending; for (as I have
beene certified) it hath had no cost, in
that kinde, bestowed upon it, within
the memory of any Parishioner living:
neither among their Records can they
finde any such thing mentioned.</P>
<P>The second fall (as some have su∣spected)
was either by the ignorance
or dishonesty of the principall Work∣man,
that for a certaine summe of mo∣ney
(from the ruines of the first) had
undertaken to raise and rebuild it. Ig∣norance
in not looking into the strength
of that, upon which hee was to reare
such a burthen; Or dishonesty, in
sleightly passing over (for the speedier
dispatch of his Taske) a weaknesse up∣on
which he knew (or might suspect)
such an eminent danger to follow.</P>
<P>How just the suspicion, I know not,
but in the Re-building of this Steeple,
before it was fully finished (although
almost upon the end of that labour) it
fell, with the Bells, their Carriages and
Frames, beating a great part of the
Roofe downe before them: the weight
of all these together, bearing to the
ground two large Pillars of the South
Ile, a faire Gallery over against the
Pulpit, the Pulpit, all the Pewes, and
whatsoever was under or neere it.</P>
<P>But now (as of all the rest) let us
speake of building, repairing, and beau∣tifying,
which briefly for this Chruch
we doe thus:</P>
<P>All those decayes and losses (excep∣ting
the want of the Steeple which
(at the lower end of the South Ile) is
begun, and from the ground raised as
high as the roofe of the Church) are re∣covered
and made whole againe: all
the Walls of it firme and faire; in the
South wall a faire new doore: The
Chruch, in the place of the old, furni∣shed
with all things new, and is with∣out
and within (notwithstanding there
is much still to doe) well and very wor∣thily
beautified.</P>
<P><PB N="900" REF="464"/>
The cost of all this amounting to (or
much upon) 1400. pounds.</P>

<HEAD>A Declaration of William Abbot
of the Monastery of St. Peter
of Westminster, concerning his
title to the Privilege and San∣ctuary
of St. Martins le grand
in London: with the precincts,
Circuit, and Bounds of the
same.</HEAD>
<P>FIrst the said Abbot saith, That
the free Chappell of St. <HI>Martins
le grand</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> and the Pre∣cincts
of Saint <HI>Martins</HI> aforesaid, is
a place priviledged: and was founded
and endowed long time before the
Conquest, aswell of possessions, as of
immunities, franchises, and liberties:
and corroborate and inlarged by King
<HI>VVilliam</HI> the Conquerour, like as it ap∣peareth
as well by the Charter of the
said King <HI>VVilliam</HI> the Conquerour; as
by divers other Charters, Writings,
and Records.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> the said King <HI>William</HI> the Con∣querour
granted by his Charter to the
same place of Saint <HI>Martins,</HI> divers li∣berties
and franchises, by speciall and
generall words, aswell in the Latine
tongue as Saxon. And over that gran∣ted
to the said place of Saint <HI>Martins,</HI>
all other liberties, immunities, and cu∣stomes,
which any Church of this
Realme, best had. Which grant im∣porteth
and includeth in himselfe as
great priviledges, franchises, and immu∣nities,
as <HI>VVestminster, Beverlay,</HI> or any
other place priviledged, hath within
the Realme. And also the said words
in Saxon, importeth such sentence. That
the said place should bee a Sanctuary
franchised, priviledged, and have tui∣tion
and immunities of all those per∣sons,
which for treason, felonies, tres∣passes,
or any other cause, should flee
to the same or abide therein. Which
franchises, priviledge, tuition, and im∣munities,
the said place hath alway
peaceably had and enjoyed, from the
said Conquerours dayes unto this pre∣sent
time.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> the said franchises, immunities,
and priviledges, of Saint <HI>Martins,</HI> have
beene corroborate, confirmed, allowed
and enlarged, by King <HI>Henry</HI> the first,
King <HI>Stephen, Henry</HI> the second, King
<HI>Iohn,</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, King <HI>Edward</HI>
the second, King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Ri∣chard</HI>
the second, <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, <HI>Hen∣ry</HI>
the sixth, and in all other Kings times
sithence the Conquest: as by divers
Charters and Allowances before Ju∣stices
of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Determiner,</HI> Writings
and Records, more plainely at large is
shewed, and may appeare.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> it appeareth by divers Returnes
made by the Sheriffes of <HI>London,</HI> aswell
in the <HI>Kings Bench,</HI> the <HI>Common Pleas,</HI>
and all other the Kings Courts, that
the said place of Saint <HI>Martins,</HI> is a
place priviledged, and Sanctuary: as
by the same Returnes remaining of Re∣cord,
more plainely may appeare.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> the said Abbot saith, That the
Precinct, Circuit, and Bounds of the
priviledge and Sanctuary aforesaid, be
and extend, as hereafter followeth.</P>
<P><HI>Imprimis,</HI> beginning at a wall lying
directly against a Poast that standeth
in the midst of one <HI>Roger VVrights</HI> a
Grocers house, which standeth of the
East side of the south gate of St. <HI>Mar∣tins:</HI>
and from the wall in the said Gro∣cers
house, with the halfe-deale of the
street unto the chancell of the same side
that house standeth upon, Sanctuary.
And so forth from the East Westward
unto the middest of Saint <HI>Martins lane</HI>
next to the Chappell of Saint <HI>Martins,</HI>
against the Tenement of the <HI>Bulls head,</HI>
which Tenement lieth at the south end
of the said lane on the West part.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> halfe part of the streete of St.
<HI>Martins lane,</HI> Sanctuary, from the south
unto the North, as farre forth as the
houses appertaining to the <HI>Bull-head</HI> do
extend Northwards.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> from the said place of the <HI>Buls
head,</HI> then the whole lane of St. <HI>Mar∣tins,</HI>
<PB N="921" REF="474"/>
Sanctuary on both sides, unto a
Post or Stoope that standeth of the
North side or end of the two Tene∣ments,
standing by the great gate next
going into the Deanes Court.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> from the said Saint <HI>Martins</HI>
Lane, at the aforesaid <HI>Buls head,</HI> tur∣ning
by a wall that divideth the said
Tenement of the <HI>Bulls head,</HI> and Saint
<HI>Martins</HI> ground: Which wall turneth
and extendeth from the East West∣wards,
unto a backe wall that closeth
in Saint <HI>Martins</HI> ground of the West
side: all within the said Wall, San∣ctuary.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> along by the same backe wall,
that closeth in the West part of Saint
<HI>Martins</HI> ground, from the South end of
the said wall into the North, unto a wall
that divideth my Lord of <HI>Northumber∣lands</HI>
ground, and Saint <HI>Martins</HI> ground
from the South end; all within the a∣foresaid
Walls, Sanctuary: and so forth
from the South side into the North
my Lord of <HI>Northumberlands</HI> ground,

ground of the West part, unto the
North part of <HI>Angell Alley,</HI> abutting
Northwards upon the South side of
<HI>Robert Bowmans</HI> house, into the Street∣wards.
And so Sanctuary still, from
the said backe wall of <HI>Grey Fryars,</HI> a∣long
by the <HI>Angell Alley,</HI> and by the
South part of the said <HI>Robert Bowmans</HI>
house, from the West unto the East,
untill you come to a Post or Stoope
standing on the North part of the two
Tenements next lying on the North
side of a great gate entring into the
Deanes Court.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> from the same Post or Stoope
before rehearsed, standing North from
the great gate of the said Deanes
Court directly Eastwards, by the
North part of a Tenement, with the
same Tenement inclosed (as by the
wall there it sheweth) Sanctuary:
which Tenement is now in the hands
of one <HI>Hugh Payne.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> from the aforesaid wall, along
from the North, Southward unto <HI>Hugh
Paynes</HI> dwelling house; and from thence
by the North side of the said <HI>Hugh
Paynes</HI> Garden, Sanctuary still; from
the West unto the East part thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> againe from the North side of
the above rehearsed <HI>Hugh Paynes</HI> Gar∣den
Southward, unto the Deanes Gar∣den,
Sanctuary.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> along by the wall on the North
side of the Deanes Garden, from the
West into the East thereof, San∣ctuary.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> from the North unto the South,
of the East part of the aforesaid Deanes
Garden, with Saint <HI>Leonards</HI> Church,
Sanctuary, as by a wall it there shew∣eth.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> from the East end of Saint
<HI>Leonards</HI> Church, Westwards of the
South of Saint <HI>Martins,</HI> unto the <HI>Bell-Alley,</HI>
Sanctuary, as appeareth also
thereby another wall.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> from the <HI>Bell-Alley</HI> South∣wards,
unto the wall spoken of at the
beginning, which is within the Gro∣cers
house, against the Post that stan∣deth
within the middest of the same
house. And so forth directly againe
unto the Chanell of the high street,
that lyeth afore the South gate of Saint
<HI>Martins:</HI> all within the bounds reher∣sed,
Sanctuary.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> by a Statute made in the yeere
of King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, it is affir∣med,
The said place of Saint <HI>Martins</HI>
to bee a place franchised and priviled∣ged,
having tuition and immunity, in
manner and forme as is above rehear∣sed.
And in speciall, and for them that
come in thither for Debt, Treason, and
Felony. In proofe whereof, the Iudge
that sitteth there for the King, as in a
place not of the City, but by priviledge
seperate, (the Maior not called there∣to,
as he is to the deliverance of <HI>New∣gate,</HI>
and other such Acts in the City)
to have knowledge there in a case of
Treason or Felony, hath ever, from
time that no minde is, sitten in the
gate of the said Sanctuary. And the
person appeached or endited of Trea∣son
or Felony, hath beene kept by the
Officers on the further side of the street
afore him, to the intent that he come
not of the other side of the Chanell to∣wards
the Sanctuary there, to claime
the liberty and Franchises of the same.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> wheras divers Kings of this land,
for causes such as moved them, have
<PB N="922" REF="475"/>
seazed into their hands the Franchises
and Liberties that the City of <HI>London</HI>
had, by reason whereof they were not
suffered to use or enjoy the said Fran∣chises,
for as long as it hath liked unto
the said Kings: yet the said Chappell
of Saint <HI>Martins le grand,</HI> in the said
City of <HI>London,</HI> with the Precinct of
the same, at the said times of such sea∣sing
of the aforesaid Franchises; was
afore and since alwayes a place privi∣ledged,
without any disturbance, di∣minishing,
or taking away by the said
Kings, or by their Ministers: and peace∣ably
used and enjoyed their Franchi∣ses,
Liberties, and immunities, within
the Sanctuary and Precinct of Saint
<HI>Martins,</HI> as in a place excepted and
priviledged, and no wayes pertaining
unto the said City, ne parcell thereof,
though it be set within the same.</P>
<P>And moreover, the said Abbot saith,
that the said Church or Chappell of
Saint <HI>Martins,</HI> within the said Sanctu∣ary
and Precinct of the same; were of
late by the late King of famous memo∣ry,
King <HI>Henry</HI> the seventh, lawfully
annexed and given to the said Mona∣stery
of Saint <HI>Peter</HI> of <HI>Westminster;</HI> at
which time, and times without mind
of man before that, the said Chappell,
and Precinct, circuit and bounds of the
said Sanctuary, comprized within the
Limits above rehearsed, were used,
allowed, and taken, and yet be, as San∣ctuary.</P>
<P>Thus farre the Abbot of <HI>Westminsters</HI>
declaration, at which time (as it ap∣peareth)
there fell out so much conte∣station,
concerning the Precincts of this
Sanctuary, that the matter was faine
to be tried by ancient sworne men de∣posed
in Court as Witnesses. Some
of their Depositions are come to my
hands, which I here give you: the rest
(and the beginning) have miscarried.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> the said <HI>Henry Williamson</HI> de∣poseth
for the claimed bounds, and al∣so
for the priviledge of Sanctuary men,
in the halfe Street and Lane next to
Saint <HI>Martins;</HI> and for the setting up
of the Gallowes on <HI>Evill May day;</HI> and
for the removing thereof, as others
therein before have deposed.</P>
<P><HI>Item, Ralfe Twyn</HI> deposeth, all whol∣ly
the claimed bounds to be Sanctuary;
and also the setting up of the Gallowes,
and removing of the same, and the
Pavement, to bee done by the Abbot:
and that he knew one <HI>Bland</HI> privileged
both for Treason and Murther, ever
used to walke in the street claimed as
Sanctuary, without any disturbance.</P>
<P><HI>Item, William Bayley</HI> deposeth, all the
claimed bounds, and also the sitting of
the Iustices in the South gate: and that
he heard the Iustices say, that halfe the
street against the said gate was Sanctu∣ary:
and that there was persons then
arraigned, and others therein depo∣sed:
and that he knew the said <HI>Bland</HI>
priviledged for Treason and Fellony,
to dwell in <HI>Angell Alley:</HI> and that the
Abbot ought to make the Pavement,
as others have deposed there.</P>
<P><HI>Item, Iohn Smith,</HI> Clerke, deposeth
for all the claimed bounds: and fur∣ther
saith, that hee knew Doctor <HI>Mor∣ton,</HI>
and also the Cardinall <HI>Morton</HI> to
lye there, one in <HI>Roger Wrights</HI> house,
and the other in <HI>Angell Alley,</HI> they both
being priviledged for Treason. And
also he supposeth both <HI>Angell Alley</HI> and
<HI>Bland Alley,</HI> to be holden of Saint <HI>Mar∣tins</HI>
by certaine Rent, as parcell of the
Earle of <HI>Northumberlands</HI> Tenements.
And also for the Pavement, as others
before have deposed.</P>
<P>At this time (I suppose) was there a
<HI>Survey</HI> or <HI>Plat</HI> of the Precinct, exhibi∣ted
into the Court of Chancery, where
it appeareth these Witnesses to have
beene deposed. The figure of which

<P>IN the times of King <HI>Knowt</HI> (or <HI>Ka∣nutus)</HI>
the <HI>Dane,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Out of Book <HI>Dan∣thorne</HI> in Guildhall folio 78.</NOTE> were there thir∣teene
Knights very well beloved
both of King and Kingdome. These
begged of the Kings Grace, a certaine
piece of Land in the East part of <HI>Lon∣don;</HI>
which the Inhabitants had lately
forsaken, by reason of the hardship<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Pro nimiâ servitute.</NOTE>
and service they there stood charged
withall. The Knights suit for to have
this Land granted unto them for ever,
with the liberty of a <HI>Guild</HI> upon it, the
King upon this condition granted:
Namely, that every one of them should
performe three combats upon the land,
and in the water; and come off with
victory: and also, that upon a day ap∣pointed,
they should runne at Tilt a∣gainst
all commers, in the field which
is now called <HI>East Smithfield.</HI> This they
having performed gloriously, the King
gave them the field, and the same day
named it <HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ytte-guilden;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">These were <HI>En∣glish</HI> Knights; and there∣fore in some wri∣tings it is called <HI>An∣glish K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ytte-guilden.</HI></NOTE> appointing
these Boundaries unto it. First, that it
should reach from <HI>Ealdgate</HI> to the place
where the Barres now are, Eastward on
both sides the Towne. He extended it
another way toward <HI>Bishopsgate,</HI> as farre
as the house of <HI>William</HI> the Priest. To
the Southward, the liberties of this
<HI>Guild</HI> reached so farre into the water of
the <HI>Thames,</HI> as a horseman riding into
the River at a dead low water, could
dart his horsemans staffe from him. So
that all <HI>East Smithfield,</HI> with part of
the right hand way, which stretcheth,
by <HI>Doddings pond</HI> into the <HI>Thames;</HI> and
also the Hospitall of Saint <HI>Katharines,</HI>
with the Mills, (which Hospitall was
founded in the reigne of King <HI>Stephen)</HI>
together with the outer stone wall, and
the new Ditch of the Tower, stand and
<PB N="926" REF="477"/>
are within the <HI>Fee</HI> aforesaid. For the
said Wall and Ditch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tow∣er Ditch first made.</NOTE> were not as yet
made; but were afterwards, in the ve∣ry
time that King <HI>Richard</HI> the first was
at <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> Which was done by the
Bishop of <HI>Ely,</HI> the Kings Justice over all
the Kingdome. The occasion was, a
difference betwixt Earle <HI>Iohn</HI> the Kings
Brother, and the chiefe Iustice. By the
digging of this Ditch in the ground of
<HI>East Smithfield,</HI> did the Church of the
<HI>Holy Trinity</HI> in <HI>London</HI> lose half a Marke
a yeere revenue; and the Mill which
belonged unto the poore Brotherhood
of the Hispitall of Saint <HI>Katharines,</HI> and
unto the Churches of Saint <HI>Katharines,</HI>
and of the <HI>Holy Trinity</HI> altogether, was
faine to be removed, to their no little
hindrance. A Garden also which the
King had hired of the Brotherhood a∣foresaid,
at the rent of sixe Markes a
yeere, was for the most part destroyed
also by the said Ditch. Recompence
was often sued for, but not made very
speedily, though promised faithfully.
Afterwards, King <HI>Edward</HI> gave five
Markes and an halfe unto the poore
Brotherhood, for that part of their Gar∣den
which the Ditch had destroyed,
and that part which it had not, hee re∣stored
unto them againe, which they
hold unto this day. As for their Rent of
five Markes and a halfe, hee gave them
his Charter, by which they receive it
very duly either out of the Exchequer
or the Hanaper, even untill this present.</P>
<P>This <HI>Guild</HI> was by divers Kings af∣terwards
confirmed. And first by <HI>Ed∣ward</HI>

Booke Dunthorne, folio 88. Which is
a desire of the Master of Saint Kathe∣rines
Hospitall, to have leave of the Ci∣ty
to enclose a certaine peece of ground
neere the Tower of London.</HEAD>
<P>It was told unto the Maior, Alder∣men,
and Commonalty, how that <HI>Iohn
Hermesthorpe,</HI> Master of Saint <HI>Kathe∣rines</HI>
Hospitall, by the Tower of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
had a certaine peece of Land,
which had somewhile beene a portion
of the Garden of his Hospitall; which
portion King <HI>Edward,</HI> sonne to King
<HI>Henry,</HI> had purchased of those of the
said Hospitall, for the enlargement of
the Tower Ditch; for which hee paid
unto the Master, Brothers, and Sisters
of the said Hospitall, 3. <HI>li. 13. s. 4. <ABBR>d.</ABBR></HI>
yeerely for ever: and that the said Hos∣pitall
had received the said Rent ever
since the time of the Purchase. This
place indeed, had heretofore laine void
and waste, and had beene of no profit to
any; serving onely for a resort or mee∣ting
place of Rogues and Women of ill
conversation. For the restraining of
which naughtinesse and pilferies, the
said <HI>Iohn</HI> had againe purchased it of
King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, of whom he had
received licence to enclose the said void
peece for the benefit of his Hospitall:
he paying to the King and his Heires,
into their Exchequer, vj. <HI>s.</HI> viij. <HI><ABBR>d.</ABBR></HI> for
ever. By vertue of which Licence, the
said Master had already begunne to
enclose the said void Plat of ground.
This the Maior, &amp;c. hearing of, sent to
forbid the enclosure of; affirming, that
the said Plat belonged unto the Com∣monalty
of the City of <HI>London:</HI> where∣upon
the Master forbare to proceede
further for sixe or eight yeeres toge∣ther.</P>
<P>At the end of this terme, the said
Master made sure unto the Maior and
Commonalty, that they would please
to give him leave to enclose the said
place, were it but onely to prevent and
take away the Villanies which he affir∣med
to be there committed: for which
courtesie he then promised, that him∣selfe,
and all the Brothers and Sisters
of the said Hospitall, would particu∣larly,
and in especiall manner, pray
for the good estate of the City; and
be willing moreover to pay some small
yeerely Rent unto the Chamber of
<HI>Guihald, London,</HI> for ever. To this suit
the Maior, Aldermen, and Commo∣nalty
consented: and further made
choice of some certaine Aldermen and

the said Ward of <HI>Portsoken,</HI> was called
the Ward of <HI>Anglish Knightgilden.</HI> And
that afterwards, about the eighth of
<PB N="928" REF="478"/>

seazed of all the Lands in the said <HI>Soken</HI>
(as by the Charter of the said King

and Canons of the <HI>Holy Tinity,</HI> within
<HI>Algate, London.</HI> Which gift the said K.

also confirmed. Vpon pretext of which
Gift and Confirmation, <HI>Norman,</HI> at

of <HI>Bracching,</HI> in the County of <HI>Hert∣ford:</HI>
even as by two Patents of the
said King and Queene made upon that
occasion, it manifestly is declared.
Moreover they affirme, That whereas
the Lord <HI>Edward</HI> the first, sometimes
King of <HI>England,</HI> had not any piece of
ground of his owne proper Lands neere
enough unto his Tower of <HI>London,</HI>
whereupon to build up his Wall, and
to make his Ditch about the Tower,
which he purposed to doe a new; hee
purchased of the Master, Brethren, and
Sisters of the Hospitall of Saint <HI>Kathe∣rines</HI>
by the Tower aforesaid, a certaine
Plat of ground with the appurtenan∣ces
in East <HI>Smithfield,</HI> adjoyning unto
the Tower, both for the laying of the
Sand, Gravell, and Marle, which
should be digged out of the Ditch, and
that which should serve for the repai∣ring
of the Wall aforesaid. And that
he paid unto the Master, Brothers, and
Sisters aforesaid, five Markes, sixe shil∣lings
and nine pence, both for the pur∣chase
of the said Plat, and the recom∣pence
of their losse long since sustai∣ned,
by the enlargement of the Ditch,
and reparation of the Wall aforesaid:
which hee caused for himselfe and his
Successors to be yeerely payable out of

sixe shillings nine pence, the Masters,
Brothers, and Sisters (for the time be∣ing)
of the said Hospitall, have ever

They affirme also, that in the

second, at such time as he held Assises
in the said Tower; it was proved, that
the said Ward of <HI>Portsoken,</HI> (hereto∣fore

made returne of all into the Chan∣cery,

<P>They further say, That in the

mis-hap or casualty, such as Murther,
Drowning, or other indirect death of
any person, in any of the places fore∣mentioned,
hath fallen out, upon which
there was any enquiry to be taken, or
any Summons, Attachment, or Exe∣cution
to bee made in any of the said
places: yea, and which more is, even
within the <HI>Tower</HI> it selfe, and at such
time as the King (now and then) hath
beene present, have the Sheriffes, Co∣roners,
and other Officers of the said
City of <HI>London</HI> for the time being, and
no other, used to make such Quests of
Enquiry, Summons, Attachments, and
Executions, and had right so to doe:
as it is most manifestly to be proved by
divers Rolls of the Crowne, and other
Records of the times aforesaid, now
being in the sayd Treasury.</P>
<P>They say moreover, that amongst
other Liberties granted by the Kings
Predecessors unto the Citizens of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
and ratified in divers Parliaments,
this expressely is one, That no Arrest,
Attachment, or Execution, bee made
by any Officers of the Kings within the

<P>That the Hospitall, Ditch, and the

the Foundresse of <HI>Trinity</HI> Church with∣in
Algate; that the Ditch begunne
by the Citizens in <HI>Richard</HI> the firsts

That there is another <HI>Soken</HI> within the

Soken,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Inner Soken▪</NOTE> which reacheth from <HI>Algate,</HI>
even unto that gate of the Tower cal∣led

the Liberties of the City, as by some
Records kept by the Prior doth ap∣peare.
That the Inhabitants of Port∣soken
and the Tower, are to be implea∣ded
onely in the Courts of the City,
for all Matters, Causes, and Contracts
howsoever arising. That the Tower
<PB N="930" REF="479"/>
hath no proper Court of its owne, but
onely the <HI>Court of the Baron,</HI> which is
no Court of Record; as by Records ex∣emplified
in the Kings Bench it appea∣reth.
That when any murther or drow∣ning
hath beene within the said Hospi∣tall
or Tower, the City Officers have
attached the Malefactors within the
Tower, notwithstanding that the King
himselfe sometimes hapned to be pre∣sent
within the said Tower, and have
carried the said men so arrested into
some of the Kings Prisons within the
City. That when the Iustices <HI>Itine∣rant</HI>
have used to come to keepe Assi∣zes
in the Tower, the Officers of the
City have had the keeping both of the
inner and outer Gates of the said Tow∣er;
and that nothing was executed
within the Tower, which pertained to
the office of a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Sergeant perchance</NOTE> servant, but by the ser∣vants
of the City. That the Sheriffe
of <HI>London</HI> hath had the charge of all
the Prisons in the Tower, so often as

thither: as appeares in many Rolls of

<P>IN the yeere of Christ 1108. and in
the eighth yeere of King <HI>Henry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Out of Booke C. in Guild∣hall folio 135. and <HI>Dunthorne,</HI> fol. 79.</NOTE> was
the Church of the holy <HI>Trinity,</HI>
within <HI>Aldgate, London,</HI> founded by
the Venerable Lady, <HI>Maud,</HI> Wife
unto the said King, by the perswasion
of Archbishop <HI>Anselme.</HI> It was given
unto <HI>Norman,</HI> who became the first
Prior not onely there, and first Canon
Regular of the whole Kingdome. For
by him was all <HI>England</HI> (saith my Re∣cord)
adorned with the Rule of Saint
<HI>Augustine,</HI> and the Canonicall habit
of that Order. Which Order, by the
gathering together of many Fryers in∣to
that Church, was the number of
those that praised God day and night
so much increased, that the whole City
was much delighted with the sight of
it. Insomuch, that in the yeere of our
Lord, 1125. certaine Burgesses of the
City, descended of the ancient race of
the English Knights; by name, <HI>Ralfe</HI>

the Chapter of the Church of <HI>Christ,</HI>
which is situated within the Walls of

<PB N="931" REF="479"/>
which lies by the wall of the City
without <HI>Aldgate,</HI> and reaches into the
<HI>Thames.</HI> They gave it, I say, themselves
becomming Fryars, and partaking of the
benefits of that place, by the hand of
<HI>Norman</HI> the Prior, who received them
into the Society, as he had done others
before them; by an oath taken upon the
Text of the Gospell.</P>
<P>And to the intent that this gift of
theirs might stand firme and unchang∣able;
they surrendred up (among other
Writings which they had for it) the
Charter of St. <HI>Edward.</HI> After which,
they gave the Prior seisin and possessi∣on
of the said Land, by<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">That is, by giving him en∣trance &amp; possession into the Church of St. <HI>Bo∣tolphs;</HI> which was the head, or (as it were) the <HI>Capita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Messuage</HI> of the <HI>Mannor.</HI></NOTE> the Church of

<HEAD>Notes upon the foresaid Charters.</HEAD>
<P>First, observe the time of the building
of Saint <HI>Botolphs</HI> Church without <HI>Ald∣gate,</HI>
which was about the age of the
Conquerour. So much wee know by
this; that it was builded betwixt the
time of <HI>Canutus,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the firs;t.
Adde this to page 118.</P>
<P>Secondly, whereas the Kings write
to the Barons of <HI>London;</HI> know what
<HI>Mathew Paris</HI> in his <HI>Henry</HI> the third
sayes, that the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> both
for their antiquity and the honour of
the City, were called Barons. But they
were onely the principall Citizens that
had this title. The chiefe men of the
City, whom we now call Barons, were
heretofore stiled Captaines. They were
the Kings Free Tenants, priviledged
all over <HI>England.</HI> Sometimes the Kings
Writs were directed to the Sheriffe
and Barons of <HI>London.</HI> The Church al∣so
had its Barons or Free Tenants; and
divers other Cities of <HI>England.</HI> See for
this word, in Sir <HI>Henry Spelmans</HI> Glos∣sary.</P>

to the Right Honourable the Mai∣or,
and his Worshipfull Brethren the
Aldermen, and to the discreet Com∣moners
in this Common Councell as∣sembled.</P>
<P>Meekely beseeching and shewing
unto your Lordship and Masterships,
divers and many Citizens of this Ci∣ty,
which with your favours under
correction thinke, that the great place
called <HI>Leaden Hall,</HI> should nor ought
not to be letten to farme to any person
or person; and in especiall, to any Fel∣lowship
or Company incorporate, to
have and to hold the same Hall for
terme of yeeres; for such inconveni∣ences
as may thereby insue and come,
to the hurt of the Common weale of
the same City in time to come. As
somewhat more largely may appeare
in the Articles hereafter following.</P>
<P>1 If any Assembly or hasty gathe∣ring
of the Commons of the said City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The uses of <HI>Leaden-Hall.</HI></NOTE>
for oppressing or subduing of mis-ruled
people within the said City, hereafter
shall happen to bee called or comman∣ded
by the Maior, &amp;c. there is none so
convenient, meet, and necessary place
to assemble them in within the said
City, as the said <HI>Leaden Hall;</HI> both for
largenesse of roome, and for their City
defence in time of their counselling to∣gether
about the Premises. Also in
that place hath beene used the Artil∣lery,
Gunnes, and other common Ar∣mors
of the said City, safely to be kept
in a readinesse for the safegard, wealth,
and defence of the City, to be had and
occupied at times when need required.
And also, the Store of Timber for the
necessary reparations of the Tenements
belonging to the Chamber of the said
City, there commonly hath beene
kept.</P>
<P>2 <HI>Item,</HI> if any Triumph or Noblesse
were to bee done or shewed by the
Commonalty of this City for the ho∣nour
of our Soveraigne Lord the King,
or Realme, and for the Worship of
the said City, the same <HI>Leaden Hall</HI> is
a most meet place to prepare and or∣der
the same Triumph therein, and
from thence to issue forth to the places
thereto appointed.</P>
<P>3 <HI>Item,</HI> at every Largesse or Dole
of Money made unto the poore people
<PB N="936" REF="482"/>
of this City, by or after the death of
any Worshipfull person within the
said City, it hath beene used to bee
done and given in the said <HI>Leaden hall,</HI>
for that the said place is most meete
therefore.</P>
<P>4 <HI>Item,</HI> the honourable Father that
was maker of the said Hall, had a spe∣ciall
intent, will, and minde (as it is
commonly said) that the Market men
and women that came to the City with
Victuall and other things, should have
their free standing within the said <HI>Lea∣den
hall</HI> in wet weather, to keepe them∣selves
and their Wares dry, and there∣by
to encourage them and all other to
have the better will and desire, the
more plenteously to resort to the said
City to Victuale the same. And if the
said Hall should be letten to farme, the
Will of the said Honourable Father
should never be fulfilled nor take effect.</P>
<P>5 <HI>Item,</HI> if the said place (which is
the chiefe Fortresse, and most necessa∣ry
place within all this City, for the tu∣ition
and safegard of the same) should
be letten to farme out of the hands of
the chiefe heads of the same City, and
especially to another body politike, it
might at length (by likelihood) be the
occasion of discord and debate, be∣tweene
the said bodies politicke, which
God defend, &amp;c.</P>
<P>For these and many other great and
reasonable causes, which hereafter shall
be shewed to this honourable Court,
your said beseechers thinke much ne∣cessary,
that the said Hall be still in the
hands of the City, and to be surely kept
by discreet &amp; sad Officers: in such wise
that it may alwayes be ready to be used
and occupied for the common Weale
of the said City, when need shall re∣quire,
and in no case to bee letten out
to any body Politicke.</P>
