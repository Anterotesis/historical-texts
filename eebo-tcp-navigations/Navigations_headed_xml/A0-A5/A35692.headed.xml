<HEAD>A
Brief Relation
OF
NEW-YORK,
With the Places thereunto Adjoyning,
formerly called
THE NEW NETHERLANDS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>Hat Tract of Land formerly cal∣led
<HI>The New Netherlands,</HI> doth
Contain all that Land which li∣eth
in the North-parts of <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI>
betwixt <HI>New-England</HI> and
<HI>Mary-Land</HI> in <HI>Virginia,</HI> the
length of which Northward in∣to
the Countrey, as it hath not been fully
discovered, so it is not certainly known The bredth
of it is about two hundred miles: The principal
Rivers within this Tract, are <HI>Hudsons</HI> River, <HI>Rari∣tan</HI>-River,
and <HI>Delewerhay</HI>-River. The chief I∣slands
are the <HI>Manahatans</HI>-Island, <HI>Long</HI>-Island, and
<HI>Staten</HI>-Island.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4"/>
And first to begin with the <HI>Manahatans</HI> Island, so
called by the <HI>Indians,</HI> it lieth within land betwixt the
degrees of 41. and 42. of North-latitude, and is a∣bout
14 miles long, and two broad. It is bounded
with <HI>Long</HI>-Island on the South, with <HI>Staten</HI>-Island on
the West, on the North with the Main Land: And with
<HI>Conecticut</HI> Colony on the East-side of it; only a part
of the Main Land belonging to <HI>New-York</HI> Colony,
where several Towns and Villages are setled, being
about thirty miles in bredth, doth intercept the <HI>Ma∣nahatans</HI>
Island, and the Colony of <HI>Conecticut</HI> be∣fore
mentioned.</P>
<P><HI>New-York</HI> is setled upon the West-end of the a∣foresaid
Island, having that small arm of the Sea,
which divides it from <HI>Long</HI>-Island on the South-side
of it, which runs away Eastward to <HI>New-England,</HI>
and is Navigable, though dangerous. For about ten
miles from <HI>New-York</HI> is a place called <HI>Hell-Gate,</HI>
which being a narrow passage, there runneth a vio∣lent
stream both upon flood and ebb, and in the
middle lieth some Islands of Rocks, which the Cur∣rent
sets so violently upon, that it threatens present
shipwrack; and upon the Flood is a large Whirl∣pool,
which continually sends forth a hideous roar∣ing,
enough to affright any stranger from passing
further, and to wait for some <HI>Charon</HI> to conduct
him thorough; yet to those that are well acquainted
little or no danger; yet a place of great defence a∣ga<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nst
any enemy coming in that way, which a small
Fortification would absolutely prevent, and neces∣sitate
them to come in at the West end of <HI>Long</HI>-I∣sland
by <HI>Sandy Hook</HI> where <HI>Nutten</HI>-Island doth force
them within Command of the Fort at <HI>New York,</HI>
which is one of the best Pieces of Defence in the
North-parts of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4"/>
<HI>New York</HI> is built most of Brick and Stone, and
covered with red and black Tile, and the Land being
high, it gives at a distance a pleasing Aspect to the
spectators. The Inhabitants consist most of <HI>English</HI>
and <HI>Dutch,</HI> and have a considerable Trade with the
<HI>Indians,</HI> for <HI>Bevers, Otter, Raccoon</HI> skins, with other
Furrs; As also for <HI>Bear, Deer,</HI> and <HI>Elke</HI> skins; and are
supplied with Venison and Fowl in the Winter, and
Fish in the Summer by the <HI>Indians,</HI> which they
buy at an easie rate; And having the Countrey
round about them, they are continually furnished
with all such provisions as is needful for the life of
man, not only by the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> within their
own, but likewise by the Adjacent Colonies.</P>
<P>The Commodities vented from thence is Furs
and Skins before-mentioned; As likewise <HI>Tobacc,</HI>
made within the Colony, as good as is usually made
in <HI>Mary-land:</HI> Also <HI>Horses, Beef, Pork, Oyl, Pease,
Wheat,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P><HI>Long</HI>-Island, the West-end of which lies South∣ward
of <HI>New-York,</HI> runs Eastward above one hun∣dred
miles, and is in some places eight, in some
twelve, in some fourteen miles broad; it is inhabit∣ed
from one end to the other. On the West end is
four or five <HI>Dutch</HI> Towns, the rest being all <HI>Engl<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh</HI>
to the number of twelve, besides Villages and
Farm houses. The Island is most of it of a very
good soyle, and very natural for all sorts of <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Grain; which they sowe and have very good in∣crease
of, besides all other Fruits and Herbs com∣mon
in <HI>England,</HI> as also <HI>Toba<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, H<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mp, Flax, Pump∣kins,
Melons, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Fruits natural to the Island, are <HI>Mulberries,
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
Posimons, Grapes</HI> great and small, <HI>Huckelberries,
Cramberries, Plums</HI> of several sorts, <HI>Rosberries</HI> and
<HI>Strawberries,</HI> of which last is such abundance in
<HI>June,</HI> that the Fields and Woods are died red:
Which the Countrey-people perceiving, instantly
arm themselves with bottles of Wine, Cream, and
Sugar, and in stead of a Coat of Male, every one
takes a Female upon his Horse behind him, and so
rushing violently into the fields, never leave till
they have disrob'd them of their red colours, and
turned them into the old habit.</P>
<P>The greatest part of the Island is very full of
Timber, as Oaks white and red, Walnut-trees, Ches∣nut-trees,
which yield store of Mast for Swine, and
are often therewith sufficiently fatted with Oat-Corn:
as also Maples, Cedars, Saxifrage, Beach,
Birch, Holly, Hazel, with many sorts more.</P>
<P>The Herbs which the Countrey naturally afford,
are Purslain, white Orage, Egrimony, Violets, Pen∣niroyal,
Alicampane, besides Saxaparilla very com∣mon,
with many more Yea, in <HI>May</HI> you shall see the
Woods and Fields so curiously bedecke with Roses,
and an innumerable multitude of delightful Flow∣ers,
not only pleasing the eye, but smell, that you
may behold Nature contending with Art, and stri∣ving
to equal, if not excel many Gardens in <HI>Eng∣land:</HI>
nay, did we know the vertue of all those Plants
and Herbs growing there (which time may more
discover) many are of opinion, and the Natives do
affirm, that there is no disease common to the Coun∣trey,
but may be cured without Materials from o∣ther
Nations.</P>
<P>There is several Navigable Rivers and Bays, which
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
puts into the North-side of <HI>Long</HI>-Island, but upon
the South-side which joyns to the Sea, it is so forti∣fied
with bars of sands and sholes, that it is a suffi∣cient
defence against any enemy, yet the South-side
is not without Brooks and Riverets, which empty
themselves into the Sea; yea, you shall scarce travel
a mile, but you shall meet with one of them whose
Christal streams run so swift, that they purge them∣selves
of such stinking mud and filth, which the stand∣ing
or low-paced streams of most brooks and rivers
westward of this Colony leave lying, and are by
the Suns exhalation dissipated, the Air corrupted,
and many Fevers and other distempers occasioned,
not incident to this Colony: Neither do the Brooks
and Riverets premised, give way to the Frost in
Winter, or draught in Summer, but keep their
course throughout the year.</P>
<P>These Rivers are very well furnished with Fish,
as Bosse, Sheepsheads, Place, Pearch, Trouts, Eels,
Turtles, and divers others.</P>
<P>The Island is plentifully stored with all sorts of
<HI>English</HI> Cattel. Horses, Hogs, Sheep, Goats, &amp;c.
no place in the North of <HI>Am<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rica</HI> better, which they
can both raise and m<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>intain, by reason of the large
and spacious Medow, or Marches wherewith it is
furnished, the Island likewise producing excellent
<HI>English</HI> grass, the seed of which was brought out of
<HI>England,</HI> which they sometime mow twice a
year.</P>
<P>For wilde Beasts there is Deer, Bear, Wolves,
Foxes, Racoons, Otters, Musquashes and Skunks.
Wild Fowl there is great store of, as Turkies, Heath-Hens,
Quailes, Partridges, Pidgeons, Cranes, Geese
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
of several sorts, Brants, Ducks, Widgeon, Teal, and
divers others: There is also the red Bird, with di∣vers
sorts of singing birds, whose chirping notes sa∣lute
the ears of Travellers with an harmonious dis∣cord,
and in every pond and brook green silken
Frogs, who warbling forth their untun'd tunes
strive to bear a part in this musick.</P>
<P>Towards the middle of <HI>Long</HI>-Island lyeth a plain
sixteen miles long and four broad, upon which
plain grows very fine grass, that makes exceeding
good Hay, and is very good pasture for sheep or o∣ther
Cattel; where you shall find neither stick nor
stone to hinder the Horse heels, or endanger them
in their Races, and once a year the best Horses in the
Island are brought hither to try their swiftness, and
the swift<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st rewarded with a silver Cup, two being
Annually procured for that purpose. There are two
or three other small plains of about a mile square,
which are no small benefit to those Towns which
enjoy them.</P>
<P>Upon the South-side of <HI>Long</HI>-Island in the Win∣ter,
lie store of Whales and Crampasses, which the
inhabitants begin with small boats to make a trade
Catching to their no small benefit. Also an innu∣merable
multitude of Seals, which make an excel∣lent
oyle; they lie all the Winter upon some broken
Marshes and Beaches, or bars of sand before-menti∣oned,
and might be easily got were there some skilful
men would undertake it.</P>
<P>To say something of the <HI>Indians,</HI> there is now but
few upon the Island, and those few no ways hurtful
but rather serviceable to the <HI>English,</HI> and it is to be
admired, how strangely they have deereast by the
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
Hand of God, since the <HI>English</HI> first setling of those
parts; for since my time, where there were fix
towns, they are reduced to two small Villages, and
it hath been generally observed, that where the
<HI>English</HI> come to settle, a Divine Hand makes way
for them, by removing or cutting off the <HI>Indians,</HI>
either by Wars one with the other, or by s<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me ra∣ging
mortal Disease.</P>
<P>They live principally by Hunting, Fowling, and
Fishing: their Wives being the Husbandmen to till
the Land, and plant their corn.</P>
<P>The meat they live most upon is Fish, Fowl, and
Venison; they eat likewise Polecats, Skunks, Racoon,
Possum, Turtles, and the like.</P>
<P>They build small moveable Tents, which they re∣move
two or three times a year, having their prin∣cipal
quarters where they plant their Corn: their
Hunting quarters, and their Fishing quarters: Their
Recreations are chiefly Foot-ball and Cards, at
which they will play away all they have, excepting a
Flap to cover their nakedness: They are great lo∣vers
of strong drink, yet do not care for drinking,
unless they have enough to make themselves drunk;
and if there be so many in their Company, that there
is not sufficient to make them all drunk, they usually
select so many out of their Company, proportionable
to the quantity of drink, and the rest must be Spe∣ctators.
And if any one chance to be drunk be∣fore
he hath finisht his proportion, (which is ordi∣narily
a quart of Brandy, Rum or Strong-waters)
the rest will pour the rest of his part down his
throat.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
They often, kill one another at these drunken
Matches, which the friends of the murdered person,
do revenge upon the Murderer unless he purchase
his life with money, which they sometimes do:
Their money is made of a Periwinkle shell of which
there is black and white, made much like unto
beads, and put upon strings.</P>
<P>For their worship which is diabolical, it is per∣formed
usually but once or twice a year, unless up∣on
some extraordinary occasion, as upon making of
War or the lik<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; their usual time is about <HI>Micha∣elmass,</HI>
when their corn is first ripe, the day being
appointed by their chief priest or pawaw; most of
them go a hunting for venison: When they are all
congregated, their priest tells them if he want mo∣ney,
there God will accept of no other offering, which
the people beleeving, every one gives money accord∣ing
to their ability. The priest takes the money,
and putting it into some dishes, sets them upon the
top of their low flat-roofed houses, and falls to in∣vocating
their God to come and receive it, which
with a many loud hallows and outcries, knocking the
ground with sticks, and beating themselves, is per∣formed
by the priest, and seconded by the people.</P>
<P>After they have thus a while wearied themselves,
the priest by his Conjuration brings in a devil a∣mongst
them, in the shape sometimes of a fowl, some∣times
of a beast, and somtimes of a man, at which
the people being amazed, not daring to stir, he im∣proves
the opportunity, steps out, and makes sure
of the money, and then returns to lay the spirit,
who in the mean time is sometimes gone, and takes
some of the Company along with him: but if any
<HI>English</HI> at such times do come amongst them, it puts
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
a period to their proceeding, and they will desire
their absence, telling them their God will not come
whilst they are there.</P>
<P>In their wars they fight no pitcht fields, but
when they have notice of an enemies approach, they
endeavor to secure their wives and children upon
some Island, or in some thick swamp, and then with
their guns and hatchets they way-lay their enemies,
some lying behind one, some another, and it is a
great fight where seven or eight is slain.</P>
<P>When any <HI>Indian</HI> dies amongst them, they bu∣ry
him upright, sitting upon a seat, with his
Gun, money, and such goods as he hath with him,
that he may be furnished in the other world, which
they conceive is Westward, where they shall have
great store of Game for Hunting and live easie
lives. At his Burial his nearest Relations attend
the Hearse with their faces painted black, and do
visit the grave once or twice a day, where they send
forth sad lamentations so long, till time hath wore
the blackness off their faces, and afterwards every
year once they view the grave, make a new mourn∣ing
for him, trimming up of the Grave, not suf∣fering
of a Grass to grow by it: they fence their
graves with a hedge, and cover the tops with Mats,
to shelter them from the rain.</P>
<P>Any <HI>Indian</HI> being dead, his Name dies with him,
no person daring ever afte<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to mention his Name, it
being not only a breach of their Law, but an abuse
to his friends and relations present, as if it were
done on purpose to renew their grief: And any o∣ther
person whatsoever that is named after that
name doth incontinently change his name, and
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
takes a new one, their names are not proper set
names as amongst Christians, but every one invents
a name to himself, which he likes best. Some calling
themselves <HI>Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tle-snake, Skunk, Bucks-horn,</HI> or the
like: And if a person die, that his name is some word
which is used in speech, they likewise change that
word, and invent some new one, which makes a
great change and alteration in their language.</P>
<P>When any person is sick, after some means used by
his friends, every one pretending skill in Physick;
that proving ineffectual, they send for a Pawaw or
Priest, who sitting down by the sick person, without
the least enquiry after the distemper, waits for a
gift, which he proportions his work accordingly to:
that being received, he first begins with a low voice
to call upon his God, calling sometimes upon one,
sometimes on another, raising his voice higher and
higher, beating of his naked breasts and sides, till the
sweat runneth down, and his breath is almost gone,
then that little which is remaining, he evaporates
upon the face of the sick person three or four times
together, and so takes his leave.</P>
<P>Their Marriages are performed without any Ce∣remony,
the Match being first made by money. The
sum being agreed upon and given to the woman, it
makes a consummation of their Marriage, if I may
so call it: After that, he keeps her during his plea∣sure,
and upon the least dislike turns her away and
takes another: It is no offence for their married
women to lie with another man, provided she ac∣quaint
her husband, or some of her nearest Relati∣ons
with it, but if not, it is accounted such a fault
that they sometimes punish it with death: An <HI>In∣dian</HI>
may have two wives or more if he please; but
tis not so much in use as it was since the <HI>English</HI>
came amongst them: they being ready▪ in some mea∣sure
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>
to imitate the <HI>English</HI> in things both good and
had: any Maid before she is married doth lie with
whom she please for money, without any scandal, or
the least aspersion to be cast upon her, it being so cu∣stomary,
and their laws tolerating of it. They are
extraordinary charitable one to another, one having
nothing to spare, but he freely imparts it to his
friends, and whatsoever they get by gaming or any
other way, they share one to another, leaving them∣selves
commonly the least share.</P>
<P>At their <HI>Cantica</HI>'s or dancing Matches, where all
persons that come are freely entertaind, it being a
Festival time: Their custom is when they dance, e∣very
one but the Dancers to have a short stick in
their hand, and to knock the ground and sing alto∣gether,
whilst they that dance sometimes act war∣like
postures, and then they come in painted for War
with their faces black and red, or some all black, some
all red, with some streaks of white under their eyes,
and so jump and leap up and down without any or∣der,
uttering many expressions of their intended va∣lour.
For other Dances they only shew what Antick
tricks their ignorance will lead them to, wringing of
their bodies and faces after a strange manner, some∣times
jumping into the fire, sometimes catching up a
Fire-brand, and biting off a live coal, with many such
tricks, that will affright, if not please an <HI>English</HI> man
to look upon them, resembling rather a company of
infernal Furies then men. When their King or <HI>Sa∣chem</HI>
sits in Council, he hath a Company of armed
men to guard his Person, great respect being shew∣en
him by the People, which is principally manifested
by their silence: After he hath declared the cause
of their convention, he demands their opinion, or∣dering
who shall begin: The person ordered to speak,
after he hath declared his minde, tells them he hath
<PB N="12" REF="9"/>
done: no man ever interrupting any person in his
speech, nor offering to speak, though he make ne∣ver
so many or long stops, till he says he hath no
more to say: the Council having all declar'd their
opinions, the King after some pause gives the defi∣nitive
sentence, which is commonly seconded with
a shout from the people, every one seeming to ap∣plaud,
and manifest their Assent to what is determi∣ned:
If any person be condemned to die, which is
seldom, unless for Murder or Incest, the King him∣self
goes out in person (for you must understand they

very rich.</P>

Within two Leagues of <HI>New-York</HI> lieth <HI>Staten</HI>-Island,

they have not resisted or disturbed any Christians

and enjoyed the fruits of their own labours, which
God continue.</P>
<P>Westward of <HI>After-Kull</HI> River before-mentioned,
about 18 or 20 miles runs in <HI>Raritan</HI>-River North-ward
into the Countrey, some score of miles, both
sides of which River is adorn'd with spacious Me∣dows,
enough to maintain thousands of Cattel, the
Wood-land is likewise very good for corn, and stor'd
with wilde Beasts, as Deer, and Elks, and an innume∣rable
multitude of Fowl, as in other parts of the
Countrey: This River is thought very capable for
the erecting of several Towns and Villages on each
side of it, no place in the North of <HI>America</HI> having
better convenience for the maintaining of all sorts of
Cattel for Winter and Summer-food: upon this Ri∣ver
is no town setled, but one at the mouth of it.
Next this River Westward is a place called <HI>New-asons,</HI>
where is two or three Towns and Villages
setled upon the Sea-side, but none betwixt that and
<HI>Delewer</HI> Bay, which is about sixty miles, all which is
a rich Champain Countrey, free from stones, and
indifferent level; store of excellent good timber, and
very well watered, having brooks or rivers ordinari∣ly,
one or more in every miles travel: The Coun∣trey
is full of Deer, Elks, Bear, and other Crea∣tures,
as in other parts of the Countrey, where you
shall meet with no inhabitant in this journey, but a
few <HI>Indians,</HI> where there is stately Oaks, whose
broad-branched-tops serve for no other use, but to
<PB N="15" REF="10"/>
keep off the Suns heat from the wilde Beasts of the
Wilderness, where is grass as high as a mans middle,
that serves for no other end except to maintain the
Elks and Deer, who never devour a hundredth part
of it, then to be burnt every Spring to make way
for new. How many poor people in the world
would think themselves happy, had they an Acre or
two of Land, whilst here is hundreds, nay thous<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nds
of Acres, that would invite inhabitants.</P>
<P><HI>Delewerhay</HI> the mouth of the River, lyeth about
the Mid-way betwixt <HI>New-Y<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k</HI> and the <HI>Capes</HI> of
<HI>Virginia:</HI> It is a very pleasant River and Countrey,
but very few inhabitants, and them being mostly
<HI>Swedes, Dutch</HI> and <HI>Finns:</HI> about sixty miles up
the River is the principal Town called <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w-Castle,</HI>
which is about 40 miles from <HI>Mary-land,</HI> and very
good way to travel, either with horse or foot, the
people are setled all along the west side sixty miles a∣bove
<HI>New-Castle;</HI> the land is good for all sorts of
<HI>English</HI> grain, and wanteth nothing but a good
people to populate it, it being capable of enter∣taining
many hundred fami<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies.</P>
<P>Some may admire, that these great and rich
Tracts of land, lying so adjoyning to <HI>New-England</HI>
and <HI>Virginia,</HI> should be no better inhabited, and that
the richness of the soyle, the healthfulness of the
Clima<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and the like, should be no better a mo∣tive
to induce people from both places to popu∣late
it.</P>
<P>To which I answer, that whilst it was under the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Government, which hath been till within these
six years; there was little encouragement for any
<HI>English,</HI> both in respect of their safety from the <HI>In∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans,</HI>
the <HI>Dutch</HI> being almost always in danger of
them; and their <HI>Bever</HI>-trade not admitting of a
War, which would have been destructive to their
<PB N="16" REF="11"/>
trade, which was the main thing prosecuted by the
<HI>Dutch.</HI> And secondly, the <HI>Dutch</HI> gave such bad
Titles to Lands, together with their exacting of the
Tenths of all which men produced off their Land,
that did much hinder the populating of it; together
with that general dislike the <HI>English</HI> have of living
under another Government; but since the reduce¦ment
of it the<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is several Towns of a considerable
g<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eatness begun and setled by people out of <HI>New-England,</HI>
and every day more and more come to
view and sett<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</P>
<P>To give some satisfaction to people that shall be
desirous to transport themselves thither, (the Coun∣trey
being capabl of entertaining many thousands,)
how and after what manner people live, and how
land may be procured, &amp;c. I shall answer, that the
usual way, is for a Company of people to joyn to∣together,
either enough to make a Town, or a les∣ser
number; These go with the consent of the Go∣vernor,
and view a Tract of Land, there being choice
enough, and finding a place convenient for a Town,
they return to the Governour, who upon their de∣sire
admits them into the Colony, and gives them
a Grant or Patent for the said Land, for themselves
and Associates. These persons being thus qualifi∣ed,
settle the place, and take in what inhabitants to
themselves they shall see cause to admit of, till their
Town be full; these Associates thus taken in have
equal priviledges with themselves, and they make a
division of the land suitable to every m<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns occasions,
no m<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n being debarr'd of such quantities as he hath
occasion for, the rest they let lie in common till they
have occasion for a new division, never dividing
their Pas<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure-land at all, which <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie in common to
the whole Town. The bes<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Commodities for any
to carry with them is Clothing, the Countrey being
<PB N="17" REF="11"/>
full of all sorts of Cattel, which they may furnish
themselves <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="bleedthrough" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>thal at an easie rate, for any sorts of
<HI>English</HI> Goods; as likewise Instruments for Husban∣dry
and Building, with Nails, Hinges, Glass, and the
like; For the manner how they get a livelihood, it
is principally by Corn and Cattel, which will there
fetch them any Commodities; likewise they sowe
store of Flax, which they make every one Cloth of
for their own wearing, as also woollen Cloth, and
Linsey-woolsey, and had they more Tradesmen a∣mongst
them, they would in a little time live with∣out
the help of any other Conntrey for their
Clothing; For Tradesmen there is none but
live happily there, as Carpenters, Blacksmiths,
Masons, Tailors, Weavers, Shoomakers, Tan∣ners,
Brickmakers, and so any other Trade; them
that have no Trade betake themselves to Hus∣bandry,
get Land of their own, and live exceed∣ing
well.</P>
<P>Thus have I briefly given you a Relation of
<HI>New-York,</HI> with the places thereunto ad<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oyning;
In which, if I have err'd, it is principally in not
giving it its due commendation; for besides
those earthly blessings where it is stor'd, Heaven
hath not been wanting to open his Treasure, in
sending down seasonable showres upon the Earth,
blessing it with a sweet and pleasant Air, and
a Continuation of such Influences as tend to
the Health both of Man and Beast: and the
Climate hath such an affinity with that of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
that it breeds ordinarily no alteration to
those which remove thither; that the name
of seasoning, which is common to some other
Countreys hath never there been known; That I
may say, and say truly, that if there be any
<PB N="18" REF="12"/>
terrestrial happiness to be had by people of all ranks,
especially of an inferior rank, it must certainly be
here: here any one may furnish himself with land,
and live rent-free, yea, with such a quantity of
land, that he may weary himself with walking over
his fields of Corn, and all so<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts of Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et his
stock of Cattel amount to some hundreds, he needs
not fear their want of pasture in the Summer, or
Fodder in the Winter, the Woods affording suffici∣ent
supply. For the Summer-season, where you
have grass as high as a mans knees, nay, as high as
his waste, interlaced with Pea <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ines and other weeds
that Cattel much delight in, as much as a man can
press thorough; and these woods also every mile or
half-mile are furnished with fresh ponds, brooks,
or rivers, where all sorts of Cattel, during the heat
of the day, do quench their thirst and cool them∣selves;
these brooks and rivers being invironed of
each side with several sorts of trees and Grape-vines,
the Vines, Arbor-like, in re-changing places and cros∣sing
these rivers, does shade and shelter them from
the scorching beams of <HI>Sols</HI> fiery influence: Here
those which Fortune hath frown'd upon in <HI>En<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>land,</HI>
to deny them an inheritance amongst their Brethren,
or such as by their utmost labors can scarcely pro∣cure
a living, I say such may procure here inherit∣ances
of land, and possessions, stock themselves with
all sorts of Cattel, enjoy the benefit of them whilst
they live, and leave them to the benefit of their chil∣dren
when they die: Here you need no trouble the
Shambles for meat, nor Bakers and Brewers for Beer
and Bread, nor run to a Linnen-Draper for a supply,
every one making their own Linnen, and a great part
of their woollen-cloth for their ordinary wearing:
And how prodigal, if I may so say, hath Nature been
to furnish the Countrey with all sorts of wilde Beasts
<PB N="19" REF="12"/>
and Fowle, which every one hath an interest in, and
may hunt at his pleasure; where besides the plea∣sure
in hunting, he may furnish his house with ex∣cellent
fat Venison, Turkies, Geese, Heath-Hens,
Cranes, Swans, Ducks, Pidgeons, and the like:
and wearied with that, he may go a Fish<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng, where
the Rivers are so furnished, that he may supply him∣self
with Fish before he can leave off the Recreation:
Where you may travel by Land upon the same Con∣tinent
hundreds of miles, and passe thorough Towns
and Villages, and never hear the least complaint for
want, nor hear any ask you for a farthing: there
you may lodge in the fields and woods, travel from
one end of the Countrey to another, with as much
security as if you were lockt within your own Cham∣ber;
And if you chance to meet with an <HI>Indian</HI>-Town,
they shall give you the best entertainment
they have, and upon your desire, direct you on your
way: But that which adds happiness to all the rest,
is the Healthfulness of the place, where many people
in twenty years time never know what sickness is:
where they look upon it as a great mortality if two
or three die out of a town in a years time; where
besides the sweetness of the Air, the Countrey it self
sends forth such a fragrant smell, that it may be per∣ceived
at Sea before they can make the Land: where
no evil fog or vapour doth no sooner appear, but a
North west or Westerly winde doth immediately dis∣solve
it, and drive it away: What shall I say more?
you shall scarce see a house, but the South side is be∣girt
with Hives of Bees, which increase after an in∣credible
manner: That I must needs say, that if there
be any terrestrial <HI>Canaan,</HI> 'tis surely here, where the
Land floweth with milk and honey. The inhabitants
are blest with Peace and plenty, blessed in their Coun∣trey,
blessed in their Fields, blessed in the Fruit of
<PB N="20" REF="13"/>
their bodies, in the fruit of their grounds, in the
increase of their Cattel, Horses and Sheep, blessed in
their Basket, and in their Store; In a word, bles∣sed
in whatsoever they take in hand, or go about, the
Earth yieldieg plentiful increase to all their painful
labours.</P>
<P>Were it not to avoid prolixity I could say a great
deal more, and yet say too little, how free are <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose
parts of the world from that pride and oppression,
with their miserable effects, which many, nay al∣most
all parts of the world are troubled, with being
ignorant of that pomp and bravery which aspiring
Humours are servants to, and striving after almost e∣very
where: where a Waggon or Cart gives as good
content <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a Coach; and a piece of their home made
Cloth, better then the finest Lawns or richest Silks:
and though their low roofed houses may seem to shut
their doors against pride and luxury, yet how do
they stand wide open to let charity in and out, either
to assist each other, or relieve a stranger, and the di∣stance
of place from other N<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tions, doth secure them
from the envious frowns of ill-affected Neighbours,
and the troubles which usually arise thence.</P>
<P>Now to conclude, its possible some may say, what
needs a Rela<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of a place o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so long standing as
<HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w Yo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k</HI> hath been? In answer to which I have
said something before, as to satisfie the desires of
many that never had any Relation of it. Secondly,
though it hath been long setled, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but lately reduced
to his Majesties obedience, and by that means but
new or unknown to the <HI>English;</HI> Else certainly those
great number of Furs, that have been lately trans∣ported
from thence into <HI>Holland</HI> had never past the
hands of our <HI>English</HI> Furriers: Thirdly, never any
Relation before was published to my knowledge, and
<PB N="21" REF="13"/>
the place being capable of entertaining so great a
number of inhabitants, where they may with Gods
blessing, and their own industry, live as happily as
any people in the world. A true Relation was ne∣cessary,
not only for the encouragement of many
that have a desire to remove themselves, but for the
satisfaction of others that would make a trade thi∣ther.</P>
