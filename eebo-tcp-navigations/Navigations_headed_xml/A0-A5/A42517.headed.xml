<HEAD>TO THE
Most Reverend Father in God,
JOHN,
Lord Archbishop of CANTERBURY;
Primate and Metropolitan of
ALL ENGLAND;
And
One of Their Majesties most Ho∣nourable
Privy Council.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT has been none of the least Arti∣fices
of those of the <HI>Church</HI> of
<HI>Rome,</HI> to recommend their <HI>Re∣ligion</HI>
to the World, by denying
a great part of those <HI>Abuses</HI> which
the <HI>Protestants</HI> have charged upon it;
<PB REF="3"/>
and ascribing that to the meer <HI>Inven∣tion</HI>
of their <HI>Adversaries,</HI> which at
the same time all, who have ever lived
in those <HI>Countries</HI> in which <HI>Popery</HI>
prevails, cannot but know, is every Day
practised among them.</P>
<P>I am sufficiently sensible how little
need there is for Me to say any thing
in Answer to this <HI>Pretence,</HI> which has
been so fully and solidly Confuted in
so many Learned <HI>Discourses</HI> as the
late Times produc'd upon this very
<HI>Argument:</HI> And which ought to make
them for ever ashamed of such <HI>Expo∣sitions</HI>
and <HI>Representations</HI> of their
<HI>Doctrin,</HI> as shew rather what the <HI>Au∣thors</HI>
of them would have their <HI>Reli∣gion</HI>
thought to be, than what indeed
it is. But yet having had some Oppor∣tunities
by my long <HI>Conversation</HI>
among them, to <HI>Observe</HI> more, and
penetrate farther into their <HI>Mysteries,</HI>
<PB REF="3"/>
than Those who have been always
<HI>Strangers</HI> to their <HI>Communion</HI> can
well be supposed to have done; I
thought it might not be altogether Ʋse∣less
to Communicate my <HI>Reflections</HI>
to the World; and shew what <HI>Popery</HI>
is not in the smooth <HI>Descriptions</HI> of
Designing Men, but in the Open <HI>Pra∣ctice</HI>
and <HI>Profession</HI> of it, in those
<HI>Countries</HI> where they Act without <HI>Dis∣guise,</HI>
and look upon themselves to be
the truest and most Zealous Observers
of it.</P>
<P>This, My <HI>Lord,</HI> was my Design in
Publishing the following <HI>Discourses:</HI>
And it is this that emboldens me with
all Humility to present them to Your
<HI>Grace,</HI> who is so great a <HI>Judge,</HI> and so
proper a <HI>Patron</HI> of such an <HI>Under∣taking.</HI></P>
<P>It is, My <HI>Lord,</HI> Your Honour to
Govern a <HI>Church,</HI> than which none has
<PB REF="4"/>
ever approved it self more firm to the
<HI>Protestant Interest;</HI> or better deserved
to be esteem'd, what by all Ʋnderstand∣ing
Men it is allow'd to be, the strongest
<HI>Bulwark</HI> against <HI>Popery.</HI> But it is
much more, so to have been thought
worthy of such a Station, by <HI>Princes</HI> so
<HI>Wise</HI> and <HI>Discerning,</HI> and so affectio∣nately
concern'd for the <HI>Churches</HI> Good.
And it ought not to be wondred, if all
Men desire his <HI>Patronage,</HI> whose <HI>Ver∣tues</HI>
are no less <HI>Illustrious</HI> than His
<HI>Character.</HI></P>
<P>But, My <HI>Lord,</HI> this was not all the
Reason I had, for desiring to prefix so
<HI>Great a Name</HI> to my Present Ʋnder∣taking.
I am well aware, that in the
following <HI>Relations</HI> many things will
occur which may perhaps appear a little
Strange to the <HI>Vulgar Reader,</HI> and will
hardly gain Credit with those who do not
know how great the <HI>Extravagances</HI> of
<PB REF="4"/>
Those of the <HI>Other Communion</HI> are,
when they act freely, and according
to the true <HI>Principles</HI> and <HI>Genius</HI> of
their <HI>Religion.</HI> And <HI>Travellers,</HI> as
well as <HI>Poets,</HI> are commonly look'd
upon to be <HI>priviledg'd Persons;</HI>
whose business it is to set off their <HI>Sto∣ries</HI>
to the best advantage, and especi∣ally
when they write to such as they
think are not able to confute their Pre∣tences.
But I hope when it shall be
consider'd to whom I have adventur'd
to present these <HI>Discourses,</HI> no man
will after that presume to Question
the <HI>fidelity</HI> of them; Or think I
should have durst to intitule your
<HI>Grace</HI> to any thing that I was not
sure would bear the strictest Exami∣nation.</P>
<P>May it therefore please your <HI>Grace</HI>
who have so often and Gloriously tri∣umph'd
over the <HI>Errors</HI> of the
<PB REF="5"/>
<HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> in your own <HI>Writ∣ings,</HI>
now to give a new force, by the
<HI>Authority</HI> of your <HI>Name,</HI> to what
is here produc'd against them. A
<HI>Name</HI> as Venerable to all true <HI>lov∣ers</HI>
of their <HI>Country</HI> and <HI>Religion,</HI>
as Terrible to Those who bear a se∣cret
<HI>Enmity</HI> to Either; and know
both how well Able your <HI>Grace</HI> is,
and how Vigorous they have reason
to fear you will be, to discover and
defeat their designs against both.
And may that God, who has been
pleased to raise up so great a <HI>sup∣port</HI>
to his <HI>Church,</HI> at a time when
it never more stood in need of the
<HI>Wisest Conduct,</HI> long continue to
render you a <HI>Publick Blessing</HI> to it:
And when you shall late have fini∣shed
your <HI>Course</HI> with <HI>Honour</HI> here
on <HI>Earth,</HI> translate you to a more
<HI>Exceeding and Eternal weight of
<PB REF="5"/>
Glory in Heaven,</HI> Which is the
most sincere and ardent Vow of Him
who with all possible Duty will al∣ways
remain,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>My <HI>Lord,</HI></SALUTE>
Your <HI>Graces</HI>
Most Humble and
most Obedient Servant

<HEAD>TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>WHen I Publish'd my LETTERS
the last Year, concerning <HI>The Frauds
of Romish Monks and Priests;</HI> I was in some
measure resolved not to have troubled the
World with any more of these kind of
Writings: And could have been very well
contented to have given thereby a fair Oc∣casion
to those of that <HI>Religion</HI> to commend
my <HI>Moderation.</HI> But my former <HI>Discourses</HI>
having met with a reception beyond what
I durst have promised my self; and several
of my <HI>Friends,</HI> for whom I have a very
just Esteem, flattering me, That it would
not be altogether useless for me to suffer
the rest of my <HI>Observations</HI> to see the light:
I thought I could not do better than in
following their Advice; and that I ought
rather by this means to testifie my Zeal for
the <HI>Reform'd Religion,</HI> than to gratifie the
Humors of the <HI>Contrary Party,</HI> by refusing
<PB REF="6"/>
their <HI>Desires.</HI> I do not think, that in any
thing of this I can justly be charged to
have exceeded the <HI>Bounds of Charity;</HI> seeing
I am sure I have kept my self with great
exactness, within those of <HI>Truth:</HI> And upon
all Occasions chosen rather to say <HI>too little,</HI>
than <HI>too much.</HI></P>
<P>Having said thus much concerning the
Occasion of my <HI>Publishing</HI> the following
<HI>Treatise,</HI> I must in the next place desire the
<HI>Reader</HI> to stop so long as while I take no∣tice
of an <HI>Objection,</HI> which I am told has
been made against my <HI>former Book.</HI> In my
<HI>VIIIth</HI> LETTER, <HI>pag. 398.</HI> of the <HI>first</HI> and
<HI>second Editions,</HI> I related a singular Instance
of the liberties which the <HI>Monks</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI>
allow themselves in their <HI>Intriegues</HI> with
<HI>Ladies.</HI> There is it seems a certain <HI>Gentle∣man</HI>
in the World, who having an extraor∣dinary
Zeal for the Truth, and it may be to
render some service to those of the <HI>Other
Religion,</HI> has been willing to take upon
himself the scandalous <HI>Adventure</HI> which is
there recounted. He pretends that it hapned
whilst he was at <HI>Venice,</HI> and that himself
was the very Person concern'd in it. And
from thence would have it thought, that I
<PB REF="7"/>
take up the stories of the <HI>Vices</HI> and <HI>Extra∣vagances</HI>
of <HI>Lay-men,</HI> and put them upon the
<HI>Priests</HI> and <HI>Monks</HI> of the <HI>Romish Church,</HI>
only to render them thereby the more
Odious.</P>
<P>It is not my design to rob this <HI>Gentleman</HI>
of the Honour of such a Rencounter. But I
must needs intreat the <HI>Reader</HI> to remember
what I have before Remark'd in several
places of those <HI>Letters,</HI> that the <HI>Stories</HI> I
tell, are no extraordinary Events, but things
that happen frequently and ordinarily in
those <HI>Countries,</HI> where <HI>Popery</HI> reigns in its
full liberty. And therefore that it ought not
to be inferr'd, that because such an <HI>Adventure</HI>
hapned to this <HI>Gentleman,</HI> therefore it did
not also happen to the <HI>Monk</HI> of whom I
there speak. This I am sure, that the <HI>Monk</HI>
boasted of it to me, as he was going to say
<HI>Mass;</HI> and if occasion were, I could tell
above VII or VIII <HI>Stories</HI> more of the like
nature; but that I fear I should tire out
my <HI>Reader</HI> with so many <HI>Relations</HI> to the
same purpose.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS
ON A
JOURNY
TO
NAPLES.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The First Days Journy.</HEAD>
<P>I Departed from <HI>Rome</HI> the 6th of <HI>May,</HI>
in the Year of our Lord 1686, and by
chance joyn'd Company with an Aged
<HI>Neapolitan</HI> Abbot, who was going to <HI>Velétre.</HI>
He was a Man throughly vers'd in the Poli∣ticks
of <HI>Rome,</HI> and had been Secretary to
several Cardinals. And forasmuch as I had
<PB N="2" REF="14"/>
already conceived a sufficient aversion for the
Romish Religion, the Corruption whereof I
had a fair occasion to discover during my
long abode in <HI>Italy,</HI> I was very desirous to
understand the Sentiments of a Person of so
great Age and Experience. Wherefore after
having discoursed him about indifferent Mat∣ters,
I insensibly put him upon the Point of
the Capacity and Learning of the Clergy of
<HI>Rome.</HI> He sufficiently satisfied me on that
Subject; and in the Account he gave me, he
observed something of a Method: For in the
first place, he spoke to me of the Head of
that Church, <HI>viz.</HI> the POPE; and from
him passed to the Principal Members thereof,
which are the CARDINALS, the ARCH∣BISHOPS,
and ABBOTS, and concluded
his Discourse with the Common PRIESTS
and MONKS.</P>
<P>As for the first of these, I mean the Pope,
he told me, That it was a lamentable thing
to see in what gross Ignorance many Popes
lived, of the most important Truths of the
Christian Religion; and that he himself had
been fain to inform Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> the <HI>Xth,</HI> of <HI>the
true sense of this Passage of the Creed,</HI> Qui con∣ceptus
est de Spiritu Sancto, <HI>who was conceived
by the Holy Ghost;</HI> for he instead of under∣standing
them of the Temporal Conception,
in the Mystery of the Incarnation, did attri∣bute
them to the Eternal Generation of the
Word; and according to his Apprehension
<PB N="3" REF="14"/>
these Words, <HI>[Who was conceived by the Holy
Ghost, born of the Virgin</HI> Mary,] afforded this
meaning: <HI>Jesus Christ, who was Conceived
from all Eternity by the Holy Spirit, was Born in
time of the Virgin</HI> Mary. So that if this Pope
should have undertaken to have determin'd
the Sense of them according to his Notion,
he would have given us a fine Instance of his
Infallibility. His Successor wish'd the same
Abbot to Explain to him the Nature of Origi∣nal
Sin, and how the Blessed Virgin came to
be exempt from it.</P>
<P>Now it is worth our Observation, that they
were just these very Popes, the most Ignorant
that of a long time had appeared in the Church
of <HI>Rome,</HI> who undertook to decide the most
important Controversie which ever was deter∣min'd
in the Church since the Council of <HI>Trent;</HI>
the Propugnators of the Efficacious Grace of
S. <HI>Austin</HI> being of one side, and the Defenders
of Sufficient Grace on the other; I mean, the
Dispute was maintain'd between the <HI>Augusti∣nians</HI>
or <HI>Jansenists,</HI> and the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> otherwise
call'd <HI>Molinists.</HI> The former of these two
Popes had at the first no great mind to deter∣mine
any thing concerning those Points:
For he declared one day to <HI>Luke</HI> of <HI>Holstein,</HI>
his Library-Keeper, That the Solicitations he
had from <HI>France,</HI> to pronounce his decision
concerning the Propositions of <HI>Jansenius,</HI>
drawn from S. <HI>Austin,</HI> gave him a great deal
of Trouble, because the Question was con∣cerning
<PB N="4" REF="15"/>
Points that he did not understand,
neither had he ever studied them. <HI>Luke</HI> of
<HI>Holstein</HI> answer'd him, That his Holiness
would do well not to begin at the Age he
was of, to trouble himself about the under∣standing,
and much less about the deciding
of them; because they were very perplex and
intricate of themselves; and that they had not
only been the occasion of great Disputes
amongst the Christians, but also amongst the
greatest Philosophers of Ancient Times; by
reason of the difficulty they found, to recon∣cile
the Liberty of Mans Will with the De∣crees
and Fore-knowledge of God, where∣upon
some of them embraced one Opinion,
Others, another; as was done still to this day,
and would so continue as long as there should
be Men in the World. Whence he inferr'd,
That forasmuch as it was impossible for him
to pronounce a decision that might satisfie
both Parties, it would be better for him not
to meddle with it at all, but to leave things
in the state he found them till they should
drop of themselves, as they would without
doubt, whenever the one or other Party (or
both of them together) should be weary of
the Disputing, and forcing their Opinions
upon their Antagonists.</P>
<P>'Tis said, The Pope was extreamly pleased
with this Advice. In the mean time it was
observ'd, that by his frequent Assisting at
many Congregations which were held on this
<PB N="5" REF="15"/>
Subject, he at last took a great deal of pleasure
to hear these different Doctrins discust, not∣withstanding
the great Repugnance he had
for them at the first; and he attributed this
change in himself, to an extraordinary assi∣stance
of the Holy Spirit. On a time the
Lady <HI>Olympia,</HI> his Sister, asked him, <HI>What
Matters were treated of in those Congregations,
that were so very pleasing to his Holiness?</HI> The
Pope Answer'd, That <HI>they were certain Sub∣tilties
which she did not understand; but that pro∣bably
she might come to comprehend them, in case
she were present there whilst one of the Consulters
Discoursed, who explain'd those Points with the
greatest clearness and perspicuity.</HI> In a word, All
these Consultations were held on purpose, to
give his Holiness a true Notion of these Points
in question. But it seems to me, that persons
who pretend to <HI>Infallibility,</HI> ought to be in
possession of the <HI>Key of Knowledge,</HI> or at least
do their utmost endeavour to obtain it: For
can any thing be imagin'd more ridiculous,
than that a Pope, to whom Application is
made by the whole Church, for the ratifica∣tion
of the Doctrins of Faith, should be fain
to treat with others, and to demand time and
opportunity to inform himself, by consulting
his Doctors; and afterwards hear him tell you,
That the very same Point of Doctrin, which
a while ago he was ignorant of, is an infal∣lible
Truth, and which he alone hath the Au∣thority
to determin?</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="16"/>
I entreated the Abbot to tell me in good
earnest, Whether he himself, who had been
witness of so much Weakness and Ignorance
in those who are seated in S. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Chair, could
receive all their Decisions for Infallible? To
which he Answer'd, That he rather believ'd
them such by a Faith of his Will, than by a
Faith of Understanding. I requested him to
explain this distinction, which seem'd to me
to be somewhat obsure, and in which I saw
that he plac'd something of Mystery. He
told me, That the Faith of Understanding
carried along with it some kind of Evidence,
that its Motives were so agreeable with the
Principles of Reason, or had so close a depen∣dance
upon Matters revealed, that they could
not be resisted without acting contrary to
good sense; and that by this Intellectual Faith,
we believe there is a God, and that this God
must be feared and worshipped; That he will
reward those that are Good, and punish the
Wicked; That Jesus Christ is the Saviour of
the World, foretold by the Prophets, &amp;c. But
as for the Faith of the Will (continued he)
that is altogether obscure, we find nothing in
it to satisfie our Reason, and we believe it only,
because we will believe it. 'Tis by this Faith
(said he) that I believe the Infallibility of the
Pope, and a vast number of other things. I
indeed can find nothing that in a human way
can perswade me of the Truth of them; but
at the same time do perceive in my Soul a
<PB N="7" REF="16"/>
secret Byass swaying my Will to believe them;
and this Byass or secret Inclination is nothing
else, but that Baptismal Grace which is infused
into all Christians at their Baptism. I perceived
that this good Abbot took that for a <HI>Baptismal
Grace,</HI> which indeed is no other than an
Inclination proceeding from Education, and
which disposeth him as much to Error as to
Truth, according to the anticipations this In∣clination,
be it good or evil, hath formed in us.
Moreover, at this rate of Arguing he was
oblig'd to believe, (after the <HI>Italian</HI> manner)
That the Protestants are no Christians; for
granting their Baptism to be good and effe∣ctual,
they must be supposed to have the same
Grace infus'd, disposing them to believe the
Popes to be Infallible.</P>
<P>Behold here the wonderful Engin that is
made use of at <HI>Rome,</HI> to tye the Papists to their
Good Behaviour; and this was the sum of all
the goodly Satisfaction the Grand Penitentiaries
of <HI>Rome</HI> could give me during the abode I
made amongst them. I went often to Con∣fession
to them about some Doubts that rack'd
my Conscience, with respect to the Point of
<HI>Transubstantiation,</HI> in hopes to rid my self of
them. When I told them, That my Reason
rose in perfect opposition to it: They answer'd,
That I ought not to hearken to it: And
when I reply'd, That it was every whit as
impossible for me to go contrary to my Rea∣son,
as to believe it Midnight at High-Noon:
<PB N="8" REF="17"/>
They had recourse to their last Shift, which
was, to demand of me, Whether I was not
really sensible of a secret Motion which in∣clin'd
me to a willingness of believing that,
which according to Reason seem'd incredible
to me: To which I answer'd, That indeed I
should find my self somewhat moved, if any
one should go about, to force me immediately
to abjure Transubstantiation; but withal told
them, That this might as well proceed from a
Habit I had acquired, and from those Opinions
which the Romish Religion had instill'd into
me: But they always obstinately persisted in
assuring me, That the cause of this difficulty in
the practice of what my Sense and Reason
seem'd to lead me to, did not at all proceed
from what I imagin'd, but indeed from that
Habit of Faith, which had been infused into me
in my Baptisin, and which then did operate in
me, as it always doth in time of danger, and
when there is any likelyhood of falling under
some grand Temptation. And when this sort
of People have once declar'd their Judgment,
upon a Case of Conscience, you must believe
them, or at least assure them, that you submit
to their Reasonings; for otherwise, notwith∣standing
all the Noise is made about the Secret
of Confession, they would soon find means to
oblige you to a very uncomfortable Pastime,
by lodging you in the Inquisition before you
ever could be aware of it.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="17"/>
I shall have occasion hereafter to inform my
Reader further concerning their Confessions,
and therefore for the present shall continue to
relate what this Abbot declar'd to me about the
Ignorance of the Clergy of <HI>Rome.</HI> For after
having discours'd of the Popes at the rate I
have told you, he passed over to the <HI>Cardi∣nals,</HI>
whom he distinguish'd into three Classes.
The first was of those, who are raised to that
Dignity at the solicitation of Princes, and to
favour the Interest of Crowns: These are
either Princes themselves, or great States-men,
whose entire study consists in advancing their
own glory, or that of their Masters, and who
have other Fish to fry, than to break their
Heads with the study of Philosophy, or Divi∣nity.
The second sort of Cardinals, are those
who are beholding for their promotion to the
good luck they have had of being the Nephew,
near Relation, or Friend of some Pope. It's
of small concern to these, whether they be
Learned, or not; for tho' the Nephew or
Friend of a Pope should chance to be the
most Ignorant person in the World, he needs
not fear that this will prove the least obstacle
to him in arriving at the Sacred Purple; (for
the <HI>Odescalci's,</HI> that is to say, the Popes that
abhor Nepotism, are very scarce nowadays)
and indeed Experience teacheth us, that these
sort of People are commonly at a very low
ebb of any extraordinary Attainments. Lastly,
The third Classis of Cardinals consists of those,
<PB N="10" REF="18"/>
who have distinguish'd themselves amongst
the Crowd by some Talent, that hath made
them to be taken notice of above others. Thus
we meet with some Preachers, who having
got the knack of that Ability, after the <HI>Italian</HI>
manner, do arrive to this high Degree of
Honour, as likewise some Generals of Orders,
and some Bishops of the most refined Parts
and Accomplishments. Now in this very last
rank (continued the Abbot) we meet with
some persons that pretend to be Learned, tho'
to speak truth, there's very little of any excess
of it to be found in them; for if you come
once to press them home upon some Points,
you soon find the dimensions of their Know∣ledge,
and that it bears small proportion with
the Conceit they have of themselves.</P>
<P>All the World knows, that the Cardinals
are the Pope's Grand Council, and the very
persons who are his Assistants in constituting
those Decrees, which afterwards become the
<HI>Dogma's</HI> of the Papists. When it happens
therefore that an Ignorant Pope fills the Chair,
and that his Cardinals partake of the same
Qualification, what can be hoped for, as the
result of all their Consultations, but Ignorance?
It was observed, that at the Congregation
which was granted to some Doctors of the
<HI>Sorbonne,</HI> who were come to <HI>Rome</HI> to solicit
the Condemnation of <HI>Jansenius</HI> his Propositi∣ons,
all the Cardinals who were Commissioned
to hear them, very fairly took a Nap upon it;
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>
whereupon one of the Consultors finding them
all in that posture, could not refrain himself
from reflecting upon it, by saying to one of his
Colleagues, <HI>Al meno se fosse qualcheduno che fa∣cesse
la Sentinella; At least there should have been
one to stand Sentinel the while.</HI> One of the
<HI>Jansenist</HI> Deputies makes this Reflection upon
it; <HI>But whether they Nodded</HI> (saith he) <HI>or were
awake, the manner of their managing of things
upon the Information of One Party only, was very
insufficient to inform them of the Points they were
to determine. This is that which made us often
to lock upon the Condition of these Cardinals with
the Eyes of Pity and Compassion, who having (for
the most part,) spent their Lives in Employments
rather Secular, than Ecclesiastical; and being be∣sides
overstock'd with Business, do notwithstanding
find themselves engaged to declare their own Sen∣timents,
and to form that of the Popes about the
most knotty and intricate Questions that can be
met with in all Theology; and of which no Judg∣ment
can be given without rashness, if a Man
have not taken care aforehand, to inform himself
concerning them by an exact, assiduous, calm, and
compos'd Reading of the Scriptures and Fathers.</HI>
Here it is indeed that the Abbot (my Fellow-Traveller)
had still more reason to exercise his
Faith of the Will, or to speak more plainly,
his blind Faith, to induce to believe, That these
Men (in spight of all their Ignorance and
Negligence) could pronounce nothing but
Words of Life and Eternal Truth. Nay, what
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
is more, he believ'd, that the more ignorant
they were, the more the Holy Ghost was
pleased to speak by their Mouths: For the
Sy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> he had formed, in describing to me
the great Ignorance of the Conductors of the
Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> was not so much to under∣value
them, as to exalt the profound Secrets
of the Wisdom of God, who formerly having
made use of poor Fisher-men, that had no
acquired Parts or Learning wherewith to con∣found
the Wise-men of the World in the
Preaching of the Gospel, did still continue to
make use of these poor Ignorant Souls, the
Pope and his Cardinals, to maintain the Truth
of the same Gospel, against the false Wisdom,
and seeming Doctrin of Hereticks. The Zeal
wherewith he urg'd this System of his, seem'd
to me to be somewhat extravagant, for he
proportionably extended the same to all Bishops,
Curats, and Monks; in a word, to all the
Clergy of <HI>Rome,</HI> whom (in a manner) he dipt
in the same Sawce, treating them as so many
Asses and <HI>Ignoramus's.</HI> I told him, That I
had conversed with several Persons of Wit
and Parts, who according to the Principles of
the Doctrin of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> did Rea∣son
tolerably well, and that some Indulgence
ought to be allowed them in this Point, because
the Doctrin of <HI>Rome</HI> was exposed to abundance
of Contrarieties, which it was not an easie
Task to reconcile: As for Example, That Ac∣cidents
are separable from the Substance, and
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>
exist without a Subject; That one Body can
at the same time be in several places; and a
vast number of such like Absurdities, which
they are fain to maintain in defence of their
Mystery of <HI>Transubstantiation.</HI> However, not∣withstanding
all that I could say to him, he
persisted always in his Opinion; and tho' he
appear'd to me somewhat too rigorous, yet
I cannot say, that he was altogether unjust
in his Censure. For if the manner and me∣thod
of ordering ones Studies be the measure
of the Knowledge one acquires, I don't believe
there is a Country in the World where their
Studies are worse conducted, than in <HI>Italy,</HI> and
where consequently there must needs be less
Learning than there.</P>
<P>I suppose it will not be unpleasing to my
Readers, if I present them with a view of the
Particulars thereof.</P>
<P>In the first place, The <HI>Italians</HI> have too
much Indulgence for their Children, and the
fear they have of putting them upon any
thing that might be too laborious for them in
their Tender years, makes them have no
thoughts of putting them to School, till very
late. They ordinarily keep them two or
three Years in the Inferior Schools, where
they only learn to Read and Write <HI>Italian;</HI>
and a Boy, who at the Age of Twelve Years
begins to Read and Write, is already look'd
upon as forward enough in his Studies.
Afterwards they change their Masters, and are
<PB N="14" REF="20"/>
sent to a Latin School, where they spend two
or three years more only in learning the first Ru∣diments
of Grammar, and some Latin words to
dispose them for the prosecuting of their Stu∣dies
with the Jesuits. These Fathers have al∣most
engrost all the publick Colleges in all the
Cities of <HI>Italy,</HI> as making a most particular
Profession of instructing Youth. But in the
mean time experience teacheth, that God sel∣dom
accompanies their undertakings with his
Blessing, and that indeed they are the very
Men, notwithstanding all the Noise they make
to the contrary, who make Youth to lose
their time. For in the first place they chuse
young Jesuits to be their Masters or Regents of
their Scholars, whose wit is not yet setled, and
who are not sufficiently grounded themselves
in the Latin Tongue, so that it is in a manner
impossible they should be capable of instruct∣ing
others. But the design of the Society
herein is, that these young Jesuits <HI>may perfect
themselves in their Latin by teaching others,</HI> ac∣cording
to that Maxim, <HI>Optimus modus Discen∣di,
est Docendi; the best of Learning, is that of
Teaching.</HI> This method is indeed for the pro∣fit
of the Masters, but is as disadvantageous to
the Scholars; whereas when those that teach
others are already perfect in their Art, and
skill'd in all the ways and turnings of it; this is
a great advantage to the Scholars, and a kind
of loss of time for the Masters, who learn no∣thing
by teaching others, but what they are al∣ready
<PB N="15" REF="20"/>
perfectly acquainted with: That it is
a very ill boding for the Scholars, to see these
young Jesuits take possession of the Masters
Chairs, who are not able to explain an Author
themselves.</P>
<P>Another reason why the Scholars advance
so little under the Conduct of the Jesuits, is,
because these Fathers being too great Lovers of
their pleasures, give too much leave for Pastime
to their Scholars. They have two whole days
leave to play in every Week, <HI>viz.</HI> Tuesday
and Thursday, without reckoning the extra∣ordinary
days of Vacation; for when-ever
the Weather is fair and inviting to walk a∣broad,
it is a very hard Task to keep a Jesuit
within Doors. The young Regents address
themselves to the Rector or Provincial, and
are so importunate with them for leave to take
their Recreation, that it is not possible to de∣ny
them. And besides all this, the Holy-days
are so frequent in <HI>Italy,</HI> that sometimes you
meet with three or four in one Week. More∣over,
every year in Autumn they have two
Months of vacancy; so that all this being
well considered and laid together, we shall
find but a small proportion of time left for
Study. The Youth, as every where else, are
very well pleas'd with it, tho' sooner or later
they are made sensible of the bad effects of it;
for ignorant they come to the Jesuits, and ig∣norant
they leave them; and having lost the
most precious part of their time, they for the
<PB N="16" REF="21"/>
most part continue Ignorants all the rest of
their Lives. Neither is this all, that there are
only a few days allotted for Study, but also
very few hours in those few days; for the
Morning School only lasts two hours, and the
Afternoon an hour and an half. Some Jesuits
have endeavoured to maintain to me, that it
was not possible in <HI>Italy</HI> to study for a longer
time together: But as to that I answered them,
that I had continued my Lectures four hours
together in the Morning, and three in the Af∣ternoon,
when I taught at <HI>Milan,</HI> in the Abby
of Great St. <HI>Victor;</HI> and that my Scholars, who
were all of them <HI>Italians,</HI> became at length
accustom'd to it. Thus I made it appear, that
they had no lawful excuse for their carelesness
and neglect, and that it was only their love of
pleasure and idleness, that had reduc'd Study
to the condition in which it was. Again, of
these few hours that are destinated for In∣struction,
there are but few moments employ'd
as they ought. These young Jesuits are never
unfurnisht of some ridiculous conceit, or story
to tell their Scholars to shorten the time; and
'tis obvious for them to start occasions of Mirth
and Pastime, when ever they please, amidst
that great number of Scholars that surround
them. But of all the time they squander away,
there's none lost with a more specious pretext,
than that which they bestow upon Declama∣tions,
whereby they endeavour to dispose and
fit their Scholars to appear with applause upon
their Theaters.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="21"/>
The Jesuits take much pains themselves in
making of Comedies and Tragedies, and e∣very
Regent is bound to compose two at least
every year. To this end as soon as they have
finished some piece of Elaborate Folly or Bou∣fonery,
they distribute the Personages thereof,
to those of their Scholars they judge most
proper to represent them, and they spend a
great part of the time of their Classes or Mor∣ning
and Afternoon Lectures in exercising
them two or three months before the Drama
is to be acted publickly. This loss of time
would not be altogether so great, in case these
Comedies or Tragedies were in the Latin
Tongue; but excepting only some few sprink∣lings
of Latin words here and there, they are
all <HI>Italian.</HI> Their end herein is to make them
the more Intelligible to the Ladies that are
invited to them. Amongst the rest they take
care not to forget the Mothers of their Scho∣lars,
who are ravished to see their Children
declaming upon the Theater of the Reverend
Fathers the Jesuits; and conceit their Chil∣dren
have profited greatly, in being so dex∣trous
at playing the Jack-Pudding. Neither is all
this ado without some profit to the Reverend
Fathers, for this gives them an occasion of put∣ting
their Scholars upon a liberal Contributi∣on
towards the Decoration of their Theaters
and Machines.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="22"/>
There are many <HI>Italians</HI> who are very sen∣sible
of the loss of their Childrens time, caused
by these methods of the Jesuits; but they are
fain to smothet it, not daring to mention the
least word of it to them; for if they should,
they would presently call them ingrateful, as
not acknowledging the favour that is done
them in teaching their Children <HI>gratis,</HI> and
after these reproaches would not fail shameful∣ly
to expel them their Colledge.</P>
<P>I cannot but take notice here, with what
a stock of Impudence the Jesuits pretend and
boast themselves to teach Youth for nothing;
for indeed every City, where they have their
Schools, provides a Fund that is more than
sufficient to maintain them, and this Mony is
raised by new Impositions laid upon private
Persons. The only good effect their teaching
produceth, is this, that there are no Persons
how poor soever they are, but may send their
Children to the College; but on the other
hand it gives occasion to a great Evil, which
is, that this vast number of Students, whereof
the greater part are of very mean Extraction,
and ill Educated, do greatly corrupt and spoil
one another. Yea, it is in a manner impossible
that the Regents should ever be able to teach
them well, because of their excessive Num∣bers,
there being sometimes no less than three
hundred in one and the same Classis or Form
(as we call it,) and who have but one Master
to teach them all. These Classes are not dis∣tinguished
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
by the number of Scholars, but by
the degrees and progress of their Studies; and
there are Seven of these in every College
where the Latin Tongue is taught. They
commonly count them backward; for that
which receives the Petits at first, is called the
seventh Classis, and those who are the most
forward in Latin, such as the Rhetoricians,
are in the first. They continue a year in each
Classis, so that the Jesuits do not undertake to
teach Latin in less than seven years; whereas
I have known Masters, who in two years time
have advanced their Scholars further than the
Jesuits do in all that time. Whence we may
take an estimate of the extraordinary Talent
and Capacity they have to teach, and the
great Blessing of God that accompanies their
Institution.</P>
<P>But at this time of day that which they af∣fect
most, is not at all the Information of Youth;
they much more please and pride themselves
in Politicks and the Intrigues of State, than in
their Schools, and in giving Law to Princes,
than in setting Children their Lesson. But this
Subject would draw me too far from what I
am upon, and my design is not at present to
stray from the matter of Studies. After they
have finished their course of seven years to ob∣tain
the Latin Tongue, the Jesuits have be∣sides
these, some other Classes where they
teach Philosophy and Theology, but after a
very poor manner, and such as is not admir'd
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
by any but themselves. 'Tis commonly about
this time, that Scholars begin to determine
their thoughts for some particular Profession;
some go to the Universities, others retire
themselves into Convents, others dedicate
themselves to the Church, and become secular
Priests; and Lastly, others embrace other
Callings and Employments.</P>
<P>To represent to my Reader in what manner
they continue their Studies in <HI>Italy,</HI> and to
what degree of Perfection they arrive, I shall
endeavour to give him the most exact descrip∣tion
thereof that possibly I can in all these
different Stations. And in the first place to
begin with the Universities; every one knows,
that of all those that are found in <HI>Italy,</HI> those
of <HI>Bononia,</HI> of <HI>Padua</HI> and of <HI>Pavia</HI> are the most
famous.</P>
<P>If a man hath but set his Foot in one of
these Universities, it is sufficient to raise him
to the Esteem of a Learned man, in the minds
of the <HI>Italians,</HI> tho' it may be he knows no
more than he did the first day of his Entrance
(such is the prevalency of a vulgar Error)
and, to speak the truth, it is not very com∣mon
for a man to become truly Learned
there, and that for these four reasons. In the
first place, the Climate of <HI>Italy</HI> is so sultry
hot, that it is not very pleasing to apply ones
self a long time to one thing: A too obstinate
and continued application, doth so agitate the
Spirits, and puts them into such an Efferves∣cency,
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
say they, that many of them would
fear the over-heating of their Brains, should they
apply themselves to any serious Meditations for
two or three hours together. But it must be
own'd, as I have observed before, that the
<HI>Italians</HI> are somewhat too nice and delicate in
this point. Which is the reason why the <HI>Ita∣lians,</HI>
not having the patience to examine a
question to the bottom, chuse rather to sup∣pose
it such as it is given them, than to take
the pains to penetrate it themselves.</P>
<P>The second reason is, because they are not
made to Write, that is, to take Dictates. The
Readers of Philosophy or Theology content
themselves to take some printed Author,
which they explain to them. Now it is sure,
that those things that are Written, make a
double Impression upon the minds of Scholars,
and that the new Air that is given them, doth
more rowse and excite their Spirits, than the
Reading of an Old Book. Besides, Writings
or Dictates keep them more in Subjection,
than a Book, which they are sure of having
always, and which the most part let alone
very undisturb'd upon their Table, yet look∣ing
upon it notwithstanding as their course of
Philosophy, tho' it may be they never had
the patience to read it all over. The <HI>Itali∣ans</HI>
cannot be charged with being too much
in love with Books, except it be with those as
may assist them in their Amours, such as are
the Romances and Poets.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="24"/>
The Third Reason, why Scholars gain so
little good in the Universities, is this, because
having had their first Education under the Je∣suits,
they ordinarily bring along with them
thither a Spirit of Libertinism and Debau∣chery,
which recovering new strength by this
change of place, as commonly it is, and re∣moteness
from their Parents, whose presence
alone is a sufficient check upon Children,
they immediately give the Rains to their Passi∣ons,
and seem to be more busied about the
Study of Vice, than that of Virtue. I assert
nothing here but what is Notorious to all
Strangers that ever frequented these Universi∣ties;
and every body knows, that it is not pos∣sible
to go abroad to walk the Streets at Night
in the Cities of these Universities, without be∣ing
in great danger of feeling the Insolences
of these dissolute emancipated Youths. Now
what can be imagined more incapable of se∣rious
Study or true Science than a disordered
and debauched mind? That which favours
and greatly heightens this Disorder is, that un∣der
the pretext of not discomposing the re∣pose
of the Muses, these Universities enjoy
great Priviledges, and this above all the rest,
that they cannot be troubled by any Justice or
Tribunal, whether Ecclesiastical or Civil, ex∣cept
only in case of Murther, or matters
that belong to the Inquisition; which is the
right way to foment Crimes by assuring
them of Impunity.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="24"/>
Lastly, the Fourth Cause of this prevailing
Ignorance, is the pitiful method they take to
try the skill and attainments of their Students.
All men of Learning do agree, that the surest
proof of the Learning and Capacity of a Stu∣dent
is to expose him in publick to all the shot
of those that are his Opposits in their Opini∣ons
and Sentiments, from time to time; I mean
to oblige him publickly to defend some The∣sis
or other, to exercise him, and shew him the
strength or weakness of the contrary Argu∣ments.
The <HI>Italians</HI> indeed as well as others,
do serve themselves of this method, but in
such a manner as makes it in a manner altoge∣ther
useless. The Defendent having Printed
his Theses or Conclusions, goes and presents
them about a Fortnight or three Weeks before
the day appointed for Disputation, to all those,
with whose presence he desires particularly to
be honoured. But there are three amongst
the rest, whom he makes choice of for his
Opponents, and who are oblig'd in civility,
or rather by the prevailing Tyranny of a bad
Custom, which at present has the force of a
Law in <HI>Italy,</HI> to acquaint him eight days af∣ter,
the Points on which they intend to Ar∣gue:
Yea, and to send him in Writing the Ar∣guments
all at length, with which they design
to attack him. The Student therefore you
see, hath a fair time to digest them; and to
get them by heart, as well to facilitate the re∣peating
of them, as to provide himself with
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
Answers against them. Neither is it permit∣ted
to any other besides these three, to enter
the Lists against him; so that the Defendent
is clearly out of harms way, without the least
danger of having any slur put upon him, and
therefore cannot fail of doing Wonders. The
first time that I was present at a Disputation
in <HI>Italy,</HI> I confess I was astonished to see with
what readiness the Students repeated the Ar∣guments,
the pat Answers they gave, and how
all the Conclusions of their Opponents turn'd
gloriously to the Encrease of their Honour:
But after that I had discovered the Intrigue
of it, they lost the great Esteem I had con∣ceived
of their Abilities, and it was no diffi∣cult
matter for me thereupon to estimate the
great disadvantage accrued to them by this
precarious Conduct. For it follows from
hence, that the most Ignorant Scholar of a
whole College; yea, even such an one as has
never read a Question of Philosophy, may
maintain his Theses, with as much applause,
as the greatest Scholar possibly can: For
when he has got the Arguments of his Oppo∣nents,
he needs only to procure them an∣swer'd
by some of his Friends, to get the An∣swers
by heart, in order as they stand, in half
an hours time, and then boldly appear on the
Bench, by which means the greatest Dance,
may pass for a great Doctor. I have often
presented my self at <HI>Bononia</HI> to oppose some
The<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, when I saw that the arguments of those
<PB N="25" REF="25"/>
who had been Invited, had been very short,
and that there was time enough left for it; but
it was never possible for me to obtain audience
with them. They are very distrustful of
Strangers, especially since that some of them
have shewed them a Trick, by exercising
them in good earnest.</P>
<P>The <HI>Italians</HI> are very magnificent upon all
publick Occasions; they spare nothing that
may adorn and set forth the place where they
Dispute: All their Theses are commonly Print∣ed
either upon Sattin or on fair sheets of Silk,
of all sorts of Colours, with curious Brass-Cuts,
at the Top of them. There are some also that
present those they have Invited, with curious
Nosegays; and generally after the Disputation
is ended, the Defendent entertains the Pro∣fessors,
and their Opponents, with a splendid
and plentiful Collation. Here now it is that
amongst their Cups, and good Bits, they be∣stow
Magnificent Encomiums upon the De∣fendent,
and upon his Master that hath In∣structed
him; they Congratulate him, with a
Glass in hand, upon his readiness in repeating
the Arguments, the Propriety of his Expres∣sions,
and the profoundness of his Learning.
But yet these Sumptuous Entertainments would
not be sufficient to advance one to the Degree
of Doctor, if they were not back'd with a
pregnant Purse; and this fair Bud of Immor∣tality,
I mean the Doctorate, would never
spring or open, if it were not watered with a
<PB N="26" REF="26"/>
Golden Shower. It is very expensive to ob∣tain
the Licences and the Degree of Doctor;
and 'tis very frequent on these occasions, to
see Learning, the Merits whereof ought chief∣ly
to be look'd upon, Postpon'd, and Igno∣rance
preferr'd, which if I mistake not, may
well be esteem'd a fifth Reason, why Students
do so little concern themselves to make any
great progress in their Studies.</P>
<P>I had always believ'd that a certain Story
very current in <HI>Italy,</HI> of an Ass that took his
Doctors Degree at <HI>Padua,</HI> was no more than
a Tale or Fable made at pleasure: But one of
the chief Doctors of Physick, whom I had a
particular acquaintance with, and whom I
will not name, for fear of exposing him to
the hatred of his Collegues, assured me, that
it was very true. He related the matter of
Fact to me in this manner. A young Gentle∣man
of the Country of the <HI>Grisons,</HI> of a very
good Family, but somewhat stinted in his E∣state,
had apply'd himself with extraordinary
diligence to the Study of the Canon Law,
and had very regularly perform'd all his Ex∣ercises
in the University; and his time being
out, he presented himself in order to be ad∣mitted
Doctor: But notwithstanding that his
Capacity was without exception, yet there still
remained an insuperable Difficulty, for want
of Mony. This troubled him so much, that
he Writ to his Father about it, and they re∣solved
together to put a Trick upon the Rector
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
of the University, a man of a most sordid
Covetousness. The Students Father comes to
<HI>Padua,</HI> having borrowed a considerable Sum
of Mony of one of his Friends, and having
brought his Ass with him, took up his Lodg∣ing
in the most famous Inn that was in the
whole Town: This done, he goes to the Rector
about Eleven a Clock at Night, telling him,
that a young Lord a Stranger, whom he
nam'd to him, was come in Post to Town to
take his Degree, but that he found himself so
extreamly tired and discompos'd with his Jour∣ny,
that it was Impossible for him to come
and present himself in Person, and that be∣sides
he was obliged to be on Horse-back again
by Three or Four in the Morning, to get a
Benefice at <HI>Rome,</HI> which he could not be qua∣lified
for without having taken his Doctors
Degree; and to give more Life and Energy to
his words, he presents him with a Purse stuff'd
with Ducats, and told him, that as soon as his
Letters should be ready, his Master in acknow∣ledgment
of so great a favour would be very
ready to gratifie him further. The Rector
dazled with this charming Present, and in the
hopes of a second part to the same Tune, re∣quired
nothing of him but the Name of the
young Lord; he got his Letters ready, and
with the same Expedition sent them to the
Chancellor of the University, to have the Seal
put to them. Thus all passed admirably well,
without Rub or Let in favour of good Doctor
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
<HI>Martin,</HI> for that was the Name they had given
him, and which still to this Day, is the com∣mon
Name of all the Asses of the Country.
This was that the Doctor related to me of this
Story; but he proceeded not to tell me what
others add to it, which is, that the next Mor∣ning,
at the opening of the College-Gates,
the <HI>Grison</HI> Gentleman drove Doctor <HI>Martin</HI>
into the great Hall, being the place of publick
Disputation, with his Letters Patent hung a∣bout
his Neck, and a Doctors Bonnet fastned
to his Ears, to the great Astonishment of all
the Doctors, who could not sufficiently admire
the Port and Majesty of their New-Collegue.
I don't love to relate Matters that turn so much
to the Confusion of these great Bodies of the
Universities, for whom I have always had re∣spect
and Veneration; and I had rather in∣cline
my Reader to believe, that all this is no
more than the pure Invention of some witty
Droll, whereby he had a mind to express to
the World, that these Rectors are commonly
more sensible of the Mony, than of the Me∣rits
of those they promote. However, thus
much I think my self oblig'd to declare to the
Honour of these Illustrious Bodies, that they
have at all times made themselves Renowned,
by some great Men that have signaliz'd them∣selves
amongst them, by their extraordinary
Parts and Learning: And when I say that Ig∣norance
Reigns amongst them, I speak only
of the generality or greater part of them.
<PB N="29" REF="27"/>
For I know that there are always found a∣mongst
them Spirits naturally elevated above
the common Pitch, and who by the Noble
Efforts they make to raise themselves out of
the Dust, do justly deserve to be distinguisht.
Neither am I Ignorant that many of them
have given sufficient Proof of their Learning
by the gallant Works they have left us; and
many Persons who have Travelled in <HI>Italy,</HI>
have received much Pleasure and Satisfaction
in their Conversation. Some of these Tra∣vellers
have proceeded so far in honouring of
them, as to give them particular Elogies in
the Relations they have given us of their own
Travels: Yet for my part, I am Inclin'd some∣times
to understand these kind of Encomiums
with restriction, and that for two Reasons.
The first is this, that Travellers are ve∣ry
often prepossest with the Learning of some
Persons, before they are well acquainted with
it, and are sometimes strongly carried to Pro∣claim
them vast Scholars, because they have
done them some Service, or have exprest a
great deal of Civility to them on their Voyage.
I know at <HI>Bononia</HI> a Person of mean Lear∣ning
and Parts, who compell'd a Stranger to
go and spend Eight days at his Country-House,
where he Treated him most Sumptu∣ously
every day, and sent for all the Rarities
that were to be got about <HI>Bononia,</HI> only be∣cause
he had heard this Stranger say, that he
intended to Publish his Voyage of <HI>Italy.</HI> His
<PB N="30" REF="28"/>
Son having demanded of him, why, contra∣ry
to the Genius of the Country, he would
put himself to so great Charges in Treating of
a Person, who was a perfect Stranger to him?
The Father Answered, that what he did was
not without Reason, forasmuch as that honest
Man had declared that he intended to Rank
his Name amongst the Learned Men of <HI>Italy,</HI>
in the Book of his Travels he intended to Pub∣lish.
It is not of to day only that the <HI>Italians</HI>
are accused for being Liberal in nothing but
Ceremonies and Compliments, and extreamly
cautelous and reserved about any thing that
may engage them in any particular Expences:
But yet if a man would take the pains to
comport with them in their humour, and
more especially flatter them in the vain Am∣bition
they have, tho' very Ignorant, to pass
for Learned Men, a Man might draw from
them what he pleased himself.</P>
<P>A second Reason, why I would not always
take the Praises that Travellers bestow, accor∣ding
to the rigour of the Letter, is this, be∣cause
there be many <HI>Italians</HI> who practise that,
which may be called the Art of being esteem'd
Learned at a cheap rate. This Art consists
in chusing out some particular and select
Points, and bestowing all their Application
and Study upon them for some time together,
until that they are become perfectly Masters
of them, and till they find themselves in a
Condition to resolve all the doubts that can
<PB N="31" REF="28"/>
be objected against them. If it be a matter
that may be confirm'd by Authorities, care is
taken to get the most considerable by heart;
and if it depend more upon Experience, they
endeavour to exercise themselves therein, un∣til
the managing of it be made easy to them,
and they have got the perfect Command of it.
And after all (say the <HI>Italians,)</HI> that Man is a
great Blockhead, who cannot insensibly make
the Conversation he is engag'd in, to fall upon
the point he is most versed in; and the more
dexterously he can do this, the more he makes
himself to be admir'd. But yet these sort of
Men, let them carry it as cunningly as they
can, they are still discovered sooner or later,
by those that frequent their Company for any
time; but Travellers indeed, who only pass by
and are gon, may easily be impos'd upon by
this method, and be apt to believe them equal∣ly
able in all other Parts. I know many Lear∣ned
Men of this Stamp: There was one at
<HI>Venice</HI> whom we call'd <HI>Physical Predetermination;</HI>
another, <HI>Copernicus his Systeme;</HI> another, <HI>the
World in the Moon,</HI> and many others, upon
whom we bestowed the name of the things
they had got by Rote, and wherewith they
continually alarm'd Men's Ears. As soon as
they were entred into Discourse with any
one, it was not necessary to draw near to un∣derstand
what they said, for that might be
seen from far by their Actions and Gesture of
their Arms and Hands, as the <HI>Italians</HI> use to
<PB N="32" REF="29"/>
do, who are pleased to signalize themselves
this way. This is that I call the Art of gain∣ing
the repute of Learning at an easy rate.</P>
<P>I do not say that all make use of this me∣thod,
there are some to be found that are Lear∣ned
indeed and in good earnest; and it cannot
be denied, but we meet with Men there, that
are very able in all kind of Professions; and
what I have before alledged is only to shew,
that Travellers may sometimes be deceived in
them. I shall add one Remark more, I have
made concerning these Learned Men, which
is, that we do indeed find some of them that
excel in the Civil and Canon Law; others in
Physick, in Chymistry, in History; some few
in the Mathematicks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but withall, that it is
a kind of Prodigy to meet with one that un∣derstands
<HI>Hebrew</HI> or <HI>Greek,</HI> or that is well
vers'd in Holy Scripture, or that is a good
Divine, in the Popish way; and yet all these
are such accomplishments, as one would think
should be very becoming, if not absolutely ne∣cessary,
in a Country that is so full of Priests
as <HI>Italy</HI> is. The reason whereof, as far as I
could ever penetrate, is, that all these kind of
Studies, are neither favoured by the great ones,
nor encouraged by rewards, nor supported
by any Temporal Interest. The Languages
of the Dead (if we except in some kind the
Latin,) are of small Credit in the Courts of
<HI>Italian</HI> Princes, because of the difficulty there
is in becoming Master of them, and for the
<PB N="33" REF="29"/>
small use, according to their Conceit, they are
of in the World, after one with great praise
has attain'd some competent skill in them. As
for Divinity, that seems yet more useless to
them, than any of the rest; because the Je∣suits,
who are the Popes Emissaries, and the
Confessors of all the Princes and great Men,
make them believe that it is a pitiful kind of
Science, and only fit for Monks and other Re∣ligious
to amuse themselves about it, and that
the best Divinity for a secular Person is to
understand none of it, but only to believe con∣fusedly
and in general as the Church believes,
as being the true and sure way to avoid all
those Temptations which may carry Mens
minds towards Novelties and Heresies. So
that if any Man should undertake, at present,
to talk of Divinity in the presence of the
Princes or Lords of <HI>Italy,</HI> he would make his
Company not only uneasy, but ridiculous.
The Case is not the same with other Sciences;
those that possess them, may by their means
advance themselves in the World. A Person
is always in good esteem that hath attained to
considerable skill in the Civil Law, in the Ma∣thematicks,
in Physick, or even in the Canon
Law, especially in Beneficiary cases. All
these Sciences are of as good stead to a Man
as a plentiful Patrimony, and are the making
of those who are well versed in them: But
poor Divinity is hated, and abandoned by al∣most
all the World. I was acquainted at <HI>Bo∣nonia</HI>

with a young Gentleman, who had ap∣pli'd
himself to this Forlorne Study, for some
years; and having one day asked him, whe∣ther
he continued in the vigorous prosecution
of his Studies, he told me, that he was just a∣bout
to quit it for good and all; to learn to
play on the Violin, because he believed that
Art would be much more profitable to him.
See here a true account of the Languishing
Condition of Theology in those Universities,
and which is the reason that scarcely any pro∣fessors
can be found in them, that are capable
of Teaching it. This is no Exaggeration at
all, but is a thing visible and notorious; for it
is this extream scarcity of Divines, that hath
obliged them to Incorporate some Monks into
their Body, under the Name of Doctors or
Professors of Divinity, to the end they might
teach that Faculty amongst them.</P>
<P>Forasmuch as I am insensibly got amongst
the Monks, and that I have sufficiently, as I
suppose, described the manner of Studying in
their Universities; I perswade my self you will
not be displeased to understand the method
these observe in the Colleges of their Con∣vents
or Religious Houses in <HI>Italy.</HI> We will
begin with the Jesuits; we have already taken
a View of their way of Teaching Latin, and
it remains now for us to take notice in what
manner they regulate their own Studies, with
regard to their young Jesuits; for if they be
able to perform any thing in this kind, which
<PB N="35" REF="30"/>
is the Foundation of their Institution, we
may expect to see the fairest Fruits of it in the
young Plants of their Society. Thus much
we may safely aver of them, that they have
in some sort the very choice of Spirits, it be∣ing
easy for them, amongst that vast Number
of Scholars that are under their Inspection,
to pick out those they think most fit for their
Turn, having had the opportunity of observ∣ing
them of a long time. See here the course
they take: They industriously apply them∣selves
to examine the Temperament of their
Scholars, especially when they are in their
last or highest Latin Classis, where they are
taught Rhetorick. If they have observ'd
any of them that are of a well temper'd, mo∣dest
and compos'd Humor, they say such a
one will be good to make a <HI>Benedictin,</HI> for
they call the Monks of the Order of St. <HI>Ben∣net,</HI>
not without an Air of slighting and con∣tempt,
good Men: If they perceive another
that is of a Silent, Soure, Sullen and Melan∣choly
Temper, this Youth, say they, will
make a good <HI>Chartreux, Camaldule,</HI> or un∣shod
<HI>Carmelite:</HI> If they find another of a
sweet and pleasant humour, and of a tender
and effeminate Complexion, such a one they
look upon as proper to associate with the Ca∣non
Regulars, or <HI>Olivetans,</HI> or to be a Con∣fessor
to Nuns: If any of them be inclin'd to
Boufonry, and to play tricks of Legerde∣main;
See there a Youth, say they, that will
<PB N="36" REF="31"/>
fit the <HI>Cordeliers</HI> and <HI>Minimes:</HI> Others that
are of dastardly, mean and cowardly Spirits,
they turn over to the <HI>Capucins,</HI> for they
are very well acquainted what Spirit Reigns in
each Order.</P>
<P>Lastly, If they chance to meet with any
poor, ignorant, and simple Youth, and whose
mind has no Elevation at all, they hope that
such a one may by their means come to be a
good Country Curate. They make no diffi∣culty
in the Class of Rhetorick, to take every
one of their Scholars apart, and declare to
them, the Calling to which God seems to
have called them. But as for themselves, if
they find one that is of a keen and subtil Spi∣rit,
brisk and active, full of Fire, daring and
undertaking, these are the Youths forsooth,
that are for their Society; these are the Per∣sons
fit for their Tooth, and such they endea∣vour
to gain to their Number.</P>
<P>After some years past in their Novitiat and
Travels, they set them to Teach Latin, and
make them Regents over the seven Classes, in
Order, one after another, which is their Em∣ployment
for seven years; and during all this
time, they do not suffer them to mind any
other thing, but what concerns their Classes;
no nor so much as to read any Book, but those
that are design'd for that use. When they
enter into the Society, they commonly are
about 21 or 22 years of Age, so that before
they have finished their Regency, over all the
<PB N="37" REF="31"/>
seven Latin Classes, they are above Thirty
years of Age. Then it is they are put upon
the Studying of Philosophy, and afterwards
of Theology; in the first of which they spend
two years, and in the latter three.</P>
<P>'Tis about this time, that the Fathers make
another Scrutiny or Tryal of the Spirits of
their younger Jesuits. Those who have kept
all their Fire, and make themselves remark∣able
for their Boldness and Resolution, are
design'd to be Missionaries, and the rest are
left to their liberty, to apply themselves to
some particular Study, for which they have
most Inclination; or else they make Preachers
of them, whilst the Old Jesuits are the Do∣ctors
of Fraternites, or hear Confessions. But
all of them generally are Educated in a Spirit
of refined Policy, which doth not shake hands
with them till Death. And those in whom
this Spirit is most rife and pregnant, are ad∣vanced
to the Charges and Employs of the
Society, or else means are found out to please
them in the Courts of Princes; and if any
one be found that is not Baptized into this
Spirit, tho' otherwise he be endowed with the
most promising Talents that may be, he is
sure to be expell'd the Society of Jesus.</P>
<P>Now the Conclusion we may draw from
what I have here represented, concerning the
Conduct of the Jesuits, is this, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is in
a manner impossible they should ever attain to
any great degree of Learning; for the very
<PB N="38" REF="32"/>
prime of their Youth, and the Age that is
most proper to apply themselves to Sciences,
is wholly employed in Learning and Teach∣ing
Latin; so that we have reason to believe
that to be the only thing they are good at;
and yet the truth is, that even herein they
make themselves ridiculous. The Proverb tells
us, that <HI>the Corruption of the best things, is the
worst: Corruptio optimi, pessima;</HI> and it may be
said also, that the Jesuits, who probably read
none but the best Authors of the Latin Tongue,
do make a kind of mixture of them in their
Spirits, to which they superadd an intolerable
kind of Affectation, that utterly spoils all the
good that could be in it. All their Latin is
commonly thick, larded with <HI>Enimveros,
Quidems</HI> and <HI>Ergo</HI>'s: I can no better parallel
this their Folly, than by comparing it with
the Vanity of some Women, who from an
excess of desire they have to appear Beautiful,
dawb their Faces so thick with Paint and
Patches, that quite contrary to their design,
they make themselves ugly and abominable.
All the honour that is rendred to their Latin,
is this, that in all the Societies where they
speak good Latin, as with the Gentlemen of
<HI>Port Royal,</HI> and in all the Schools of Physicians,
it is termed <HI>pitiful Jesuits Latin.</HI></P>
<P>As for what concerns their Philosophy and
Divinity, which they are made to Study, af∣ter
that they have Taught Latin, that we
may discover the nature thereof, we are first to
<PB N="39" REF="32"/>
know, that the Society of Jesuits, having been
instituted at <HI>Rome</HI> by <HI>Ignatius Loyola,</HI> had at
first no other Schools, besides the publick
Schools, nor any other Opinions, but such as
are commonly Taught there.</P>
<P>In their general Assembly held in the year
1550, they made some Constitutions, by
which their Founder oblig'd them to follow
the Doctrin of St. <HI>Thomas Aquinas,</HI> as to their
Divinity, and consequently in all Questions of
Philosophy, that necessarily depend upon it.
There are to this day some of their Theses
to be seen, publickly defended by them in
their College at <HI>Rome,</HI> in the years 1560,
and 1562; a short time after the Death of
their Founder, and at the sitting of the Coun∣cil
of <HI>Trent,</HI> where they defend the Opinions
of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> concerning Grace, directly op∣posit
to those they maintain at present. In
the mean time, <HI>James Lainez</HI> being chosen
General in 1558, two years after the Death
of <HI>Ignatius Loyola,</HI> he caused a Statute to pass,
at the same Assembly where he had been
Elected, by the which it was resolved, that
they should Teach also the Master of Sen∣tences;
but in case afterwards, it should be
judged, that some other Author, would be
more profitable to the Students, as if they
should think fit to compose a new Sum of
Theology, or any other <HI>Work that might bet∣ter
comport with the Times, (Temporibus accommo∣datior,)</HI>
that then the same might be made
<PB N="40" REF="33"/>
use of, after a mature Deliberation. <HI>Lainez</HI>
having thus left the Jesuits at liberty, to find
out a method of Teaching Philosophy, more
accommodate to the latter Times, than that
which had been followed ever since the School∣men
were known in the World, (for it was
about this time, that they resolved to set up
for great Politicians, and to be the Depravers
of Science and Morality, the better to please
the corrupt age in which their Lot was fallen;)
and the very same year several Instances were
given of this Corruption.</P>
<P>In the University of <HI>Salamanca, Prudentius</HI>
of <HI>Monte Major</HI> a Jesuit, publickly maintained
a Thesis, wherein he rejected all the absolute
Decrees of God, with respect to acts of hu∣man
Liberty, and particularly all Predestina∣tion
gratuitous and independent on any fore∣sight
of good actions, with some other like
Doctrins. The Divinity Faculty of that
University condemned them, but they pleased
the Society well enough, who gave permission
to their Divines to teach them, according as
occasion and Time should seem favourable
for it.</P>
<P>Now in order to their finding out a way
intirely to shake off the Yoak of St. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s
Doctrin, <HI>Claudius Aqua Viva,</HI> General of the
Jesuits, in the year 1584, called to <HI>Rome</HI> six
of the most able Divines of the Society, with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>der to consult beforehand, the most Lear∣ned
of each Province, to make a choice of
<PB N="41" REF="33"/>
those select Opinions, which were to be
taught in their Society. These Divines be∣ing
come to <HI>Rome,</HI> they there compos'd a
Book with this Title; <HI>Ratio atque Institutio Stu∣diorum
Societatis Jesu. The way and Institution
of the Studies of the Society of Jesus,</HI> which
was Printed in 1586. Here it was that they
absolutely cast off S. <HI>Austin</HI> and S. <HI>Thomas,</HI>
upon the Points of <HI>Predestination</HI> and <HI>Physical
Predetermination,</HI> which they were allow'd the
Liberty to maintain till then. They establish∣ed
their <HI>mediate knowledge,</HI> the Foresight of
future Contingents, and they explain'd the
Efficacy of Grace, after the manner of the
<HI>Pelagians,</HI> and <HI>Semipelagians,</HI> as if the same
were intirely dependent on the Free-will of
Man, which they do not suppose to be so
corrupt, as the most Venerable Doctors of
Antiquity, and particularly S. <HI>Austin</HI> took it
to be.</P>
<P>It will not be besides our purpose, to repre∣sent
to you here a brief Reflexion upon a
short Sentence I met with in the same <HI>Directory
of the Studies of the Society,</HI> where it is said,
<HI>that it is for the honour of the Society of Jesus
that a new Theology be introduc'd, with Liberty
of Spirit:</HI> That is to say, without being too
strictly tied up to the Opinions of the ancient
Fathers, or to the Decisions of the Modern
Doctors. Besides it implies, that they had a
terrible Itch of Pride to joyn to their Novel
Institution, a novelty of Doctrin and Morals,
<PB N="42" REF="34"/>
that might distinguish them from all others.
For it seem'd somewhat hard and grating up∣on
them, that being Jesuits, they were fain
to be <HI>Thomists</HI> in their Opinions.</P>
<P><HI>Molina</HI> a Spanish Jesuit, was one of the
most bold and venturous in Publishing the
new Doctrin of the Society, and publickly
boasted, that the greater part of it, was of
his own Invention. He Published in the year
1588, his Work intituled <HI>The Concord of Grace
and Free-will:</HI> The Opinions he there vented,
were the same with those of other Jesuits, but
proved by Metaphysical Reasons, after the
manner of the Schools. He made no bones
to say, that S. <HI>Austin</HI> had been involved in a
kind of Darkness, as to what concerns the
Doctrin of Grace; and that he had believ'd
that <HI>Gratuitous Predestination</HI> was necessarily
joyn'd with it. The design of the Jesuits here∣in
was this, that conformably to the Resolu∣tion
they had taken, to distinguish themselves
by abandoning S. <HI>Thomas,</HI> and finding as yet
no means, they had a mind cunningly and
under other Terms, to restore <HI>Pelagianism,</HI>
which seem'd to them more plausible to be
maintain'd, than the efficacious Grace of
S. <HI>Austin,</HI> which too openly favoured the ne∣cessitating
Grace of <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Calvin,</HI> (as
they are pleas'd to call it,) which had been
condemned at the Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> or rather,
which seem'd to be one and the same with it.
To the end therefore, they might more dex∣terously
<PB N="43" REF="34"/>
obtain this their end, and the more
sweetly engage the minds of Men to receive
it; they were not wanting from time to time,
to make their Disciples publickly to maintain
the Doctrin of S. <HI>Austin</HI> and S. <HI>Thomas,</HI> that
by this means they might appear to be disin∣terested
Men, and that searched after nothing
but the Truth. But all this their address and
cunning, did not hinder the <HI>Dominicans,</HI> being
incensed by <HI>Molina</HI>'s Book, openly to oppose
themselves against their Innovations, and suc∣ceeded
so well in their Pursuit, that <HI>Clement</HI>
VIII. established a Congregation at <HI>Rome,</HI> to
hear the Reasons of both Parties. They be∣gan
with the Examination of <HI>Molina</HI>'s Book,
and they reduc'd his Doctrin to four Princi∣ples,
which they explained in divers Proposi∣tions.
And forasmuch as they make a part of
the Theology of the Jesuits, I do not think
it a wandring from my Subject, to give you
here a short account of them.</P>
<P><HI>The first Principle of</HI> Molina <HI>is,</HI> That the ge∣neral
Concourse of God, doth not consist in acting
upon second Causes, as if they stood in need of
being moved by God, in order to produce their ef∣fect;
but that God acts immediately in the Action,
together with the Cause; and that if God should
push on the Will to act, he would thereby ruin the
Liberty thereof. <HI>From which Principle</HI> Molina
<HI>drew these Consequences.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="35"/>
1. That Man by the strength of Nature, can
believe Supernatural Mysteries.</P>
<P>2. That having performed what lies in him,
according to his natural Strength and Ability,
God comes in and bestows his Grace; and that
God foreseeing who those are, that will make use
of these Abilities, when the Gospel shall be Preach∣ed
unto them, he is ready to bestow upon them
the Grace that is necessary for their total Conver∣sion.</P>
<P>3. That a man by his natural Strength, can
form a resolution of never offending God, for time
to come.</P>
<P>4. That natural Light may be sufficient to keep
the Law of Nature, whatsoever trouble or diffi∣culty
there may be in the doing of it.</P>
<P><HI>The Second Principle of</HI> Molina <HI>is,</HI> that God
doth not refuse to any grown Person, the assistance
that is necessary for him to persevere in that which
it good; so that it is the fault of him who doth
not persevere in Godliness, and not the want of
Grace, that makes him to fall away.</P>
<P><HI>The Third Principle is,</HI> that we are to distin∣guish
in God, three sorts of Knowledg, the one
purely Natural, the other altogether free, and the
third Mediate, or partaking of both; according
to which latter, God by the intimate knowledg he
hath of the Free-will of every man, knows what
he would do, supposing such or such a thing, tho'
it be in his power to do the contrary. <HI>Under this
Principle are comprehended these Proposi∣tions.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="35"/>
1. That there is but one exciting Grace, and
none that is Efficacious in it self.</P>
<P>2. That it is not Grace that determines the Free-will,
but that the Free-will determines it self.</P>
<P><HI>The Fourth Principle is,</HI> That God Predesti∣nates
those, who he foresees by his mediate know∣ledg,
will make good use of the strength of Na∣ture
and of Grace.</P>
<P>The Consulters of the Congregation, <HI>de
Auxiliis,</HI> (for so they call'd them, because they
therein treated concerning the assistances
which God affords Men, in order to apply
themselves to that which is good;) had couch∣ed
the Sentiments of <HI>Molina</HI> in Twenty Pro∣positions,
whereof the most are the very same,
or to the same Sense of those we have here
set down. They censured every one of them,
as may be seen in the abridgment of the Acts,
which is still in being, and declared that <HI>Mo∣lina</HI>
and his Adherents, which are the Jesuits,
had espoused the Opinions of the <HI>Pelagians,</HI>
and the <HI>Semipelagians,</HI> as well in the Princi∣ples
of their Doctrin, as in their Proofs and
Objections. They tell us that hereupon, the
Jesuits joyned Threats with their Prayers, to
hinder the Publication of this Censure, and
that out of very Rage they publickly maintain'd
in <HI>Rome,</HI> that it was no part of the Faith, that
<HI>Clement</HI> VIII. was Pope, and that he was not
Infallible. Their Adversaries have used the
same liberty towards the Popes, when ever
they proved contrary to them, and there is
<PB N="46" REF="36"/>
great probability, that they do not think them∣selves
oblig'd to maintain the Infallibility of
the Pope, except then only when it is of use
to them to overthrow their Adversaries. How∣ever
the Pope was resolved to decide this dif∣ference
by a Bull, in case the Jesuits should re∣fuse
to submit themselves: But his Death
which hapned the Eighth of <HI>March 1605,</HI> de∣livered
them from the fear they were in of
being forced to retract their Doctrin, or of
being Condemned. <HI>Paul</HI> V. who succeeded
to <HI>Leo</HI> XI. took the same matter in hand,
with design to decide it.</P>
<P>At this time it was, that the Jesuits, being
in a greater apprehension than ever, of seeing
their Doctrin Condemned for Heretical, and
all their fine Projects for establishing of their
Novel Opinions, overthrown; their General
<HI>Aqua Viva</HI> thought fit to make a Show of
changing them in some respect. He made a
Decree, dated the Fourteenth of <HI>December,</HI>
whereby he ordered those of the Society, for
time to come, to teach this Doctrin with
some Modification, by approaching in some
Degree to the Grace of the <HI>Thomists:</HI> But this
having been cast in the Teeth of the Jesuits,
as a reproach tending to their shame and con∣fusion,
<HI>Mutio Vitellexti,</HI> the Successor of <HI>Aqua
Viva</HI> in the Generalship, declared, that it
had not been the intention of his Predecessor,
to retract their Dogmas, and accordingly he re∣stored
the Opinions of the Society to their
<PB N="47" REF="36"/>
former State. Thus we see that the Doctrin
of the Jesuits changed three times in less than
Thirty years: For they departed from the
Sentiments of S. <HI>Austin</HI> and S. <HI>Thomas,</HI> to those
of the <HI>Pelagians,</HI> and from thence they re∣turned
again anew to those of S. <HI>Thomas,</HI>
from whence soon after they fell again to
their discharged Vomit, I mean to <HI>Molinism</HI>
or <HI>Pelagianism.</HI> They gave a remarkable in∣stance
in these their shiftings, that they did
indeed accommodate their Doctrin to the
times, <HI>Temporibus accommodatior,</HI> according to
their own expression. And that at last the
great Itch they had of signalizing their Socie∣ty
by novel and particular Opinions, pre∣vail'd
against all manner of Reasons whatsoe∣ver.
They knew so well to manage the Spi∣rit
of <HI>Paul</HI> V. which they had sweetned to∣wards
them, by dedicating to him a second
Edition of <HI>Cassianius,</HI> that notwithstanding
the Doctrin of <HI>Molina,</HI> the Jesuit, had been
pronounced Heretical, by the Congregation
<HI>de Auxilus,</HI> as well as by himself and his Pre∣decessors,
he forbore Publishing the Bull,
which he had prepared to thunder-strike it
with, and contented himself with the Pub∣lishing
of a Decree, by which he imposed si∣lence
on both Parties, until it should please
him to make the Decision. The Jesuits in
the mean time, persisted in their new Dogmas,
and in process of Time, had the good success
to keep them standing, in spite of their Ad∣versaries.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="37"/>
I cannot deny, but that the Church of
<HI>Rome</HI> hath a great Interest on one hand, to
Found new Religious Orders, as being a sort
of People, that promise total Subjection, and
inviolabe Faithfulness to her; but on the other
hand, Time may make it appear, that they
will prove a great means of rending and dis∣membring
her, by their restless Ambition of
distinguishing themselves by their Doctrins.</P>
<P>This is that which wanted little of being
accomplisht in our days, wherein we have
seen a vast number of <HI>Augustinians</HI> and <HI>Tho∣mists,</HI>
under the name of <HI>Jansenists,</HI> in a fair
way of rending themselves from the Church
of <HI>Rome,</HI> when by the instigation of the Je∣suits,
they were going about to condemn the
Dogmas of their Masters. Yet was it not the
Solidity and prevalency of the Jesuitical Ar∣guments,
that made them triumph at last;
but indeed the only thing that procured them
this advantage, was the Temporal Power,
which at present they have acquired in all
Places, that follow the Communion of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>It was observed, that whilst the poor <HI>Janse∣nists,</HI>
good Souls, were wholly employed in po∣ring
upon S. <HI>Austin,</HI> to search out those Pas∣sages
they stood in need of, to maintain their
<HI>Efficacious Grace,</HI> these made it their chief bu∣siness
to manage the Spirit of the Pope, and
of the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> to secure themselves a
Party in the <HI>Sorbonne,</HI> and to engage the Bi∣shops
in <HI>France</HI> on their side, by making use of
the Royal Authority.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="37"/>
To make an end of giving you a just and
full Idea of all their Divinity, it shall suffice
to acquaint you, that the Faculty of <HI>Lovain,</HI>
in the Year 1677, did by their Deputies,
present to the Pope, several Propositions re∣lating
to Morals, drawn out of the Books of
Jesuits, Sixty five whereof were Condemned by
a Decree of the Second of <HI>March 1678.</HI> This
only consideration of the multiplicity of Er∣rors
that are found in their Books, ought to
be a sufficient Ground to the Papists, for sus∣pecting
all the Divinity of these Reverend
Fathers. It is not without cause, that the
Modern Papists are accused of being the grea∣test
Lyars in the World, of having no human
Faith, of Violating all manner of Oaths,
of breaking their Words, and of making less
difficulty of forswearing themselves, than the
very Turks and Infidels. They are behold∣ing
for the Progress they have made in these
goodly Virtues, to the Novel Doctrin of the
Jesuits, who have introduced their mental re∣strictions,
to save them from the odious charge
of a Lye.</P>
<P>According to these Casuists, if a Christian
be asked Whether he believe in Jesus Christ;
he may answer no; supposing that he means
in his heart, that he doth not believe in him
as the Turks do, who believe in him, only as
a Prophet. If he be asked Whether he be a
Protestant; he may say upon occasion, that he
is one, if his inward meaning be, that he pro∣tests
<PB N="50" REF="38"/>
against the Errors of the Protestants. I
heard a <HI>Penegyrick</HI> pronounced at <HI>Milan,</HI> by a
Jesuit, in honour of St. <HI>Charles Borromeo,</HI> Car∣dinal
and Archbishop of that City: One of
the Principal Points insisted on, was the great
Charity this Saint exprest towards two Fa∣mous
Robbers on the High-way, who were
Pursued by some Officers of Justice; they
asked the Saint, Whether he had seen these
two Criminals passing that way? No, quoth he,
they did not pass this way: You must know,
he had at that time his Finger in his Sleeve,
through which, his meaning was, that the
Robbers had not passed; and the Officers giv∣ing
credit to his words, ceased from pursuing
them, by which means they had the opportu∣nity
to make their escape. O action truly ho∣ly
and worthy of all praise! Precious Fruit of
the mental reservation of the Jesuits!</P>
<P>The World must also be informed, that af∣ter
three years Study spent upon this Excel∣lent
Divinity, the Jesuits make choice of
their Preachers, and Missionaries, without
ever having had the time, nay it may be, so
much as a thought, to read the Scriptures or
the Fathers; and accordingly we may guess,
what these men are capable to perform. The
former, <HI>viz.</HI> their Preachers abound in words,
without much Sense or Solidity, <HI>Multa verba,
nullus fere sensus:</HI> And as for the latter, that is,
their Missionaries, we may take the height of
their Standard, by those of them we meet with
<PB N="51" REF="38"/>
in <HI>England;</HI> whose whole Stock commonly a∣mounts
to no more than two or three poor
Arguments, which after all conclude nothing.</P>
<P>They demand in the first place, Where the
Protestant Church was before <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Cal∣vin?</HI>
and then set themselves to exaggerate the
Vices and Defects of those two Persons. From
thence they pass over to give a Representation
of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. in the most malicious Colours
they can; and conclude from all this, that it
is very unlikely, that God should ever have
made use of such Persons, to make a Reforma∣tion.
Others of them ask a Protestant, Whe∣ther
it be absolutely impossible for a Man to be
saved in the Romish Religion? And because he
is more Charitable than they are, and unwil∣ling
to condemn any one, they would infer
from thence, that theirs is the surest side.</P>
<P>I am acquainted here in <HI>London</HI> with a Lady,
who turned Papist in King <HI>James</HI> his time;
the Argument that overswayed her was this:
The Jesuits told her, that that must be the true
Church, which can give full assurance of Sal∣vation
to all her Members; that the Protestant
Church gives no assurance at all; but that the
Romish Church does: From whence it follow∣ed,
that she must be the true Church. Where∣upon,
this Gentlewoman went, as she said,
and consulted the most able Doctors of <HI>London,</HI>
the Deans and Bishops, asking them, Whether
by persevering a good Protestant, and living
well, she should Infallibly be saved? To which
<PB N="52" REF="39"/>
she saith, they gave her only this Answer,
That they hoped, that by the goodness of God,
and the merits of Jesus Christ, she should be
so. This so modest and rational an Answer,
was not sufficient to confirm the Gentlewo∣man.
The Jesuits were not wanting to ob∣serve
to her, that the Bishops had said to her, <HI>we
hope,</HI> which did express nothing of Certainty
or Assurance; but that as for them, they assu∣red
her, that she should Infallibly be Saved in
the Roman Catholick Religion.</P>
<P>Indeed it is not easy for me to believe, that
so pitiful an Argument should have been capa∣ble
to perswade a Gentlewoman, who other∣wise
seems to have Wit enough; and that in
all probability, there must have been some o∣ther
motive of Interest lurking, more strong
than all this, and that some Promise had been
given her, of the advancement of her Hus∣band
in King <HI>James</HI> his Court. In the mean
time, he is at present in <HI>Ireland,</HI> where not∣withstanding
all the fair Promises the Je∣suits
may have given him, he is fain to live
on hopes.</P>
<P><HI>That I may not run out into a long Digres∣sion,
having now represented to you the or∣der
and method of the Studies of the Jesuits,
I shall pass over to the Studies of the other
Religious Orders, which I shall comprize in
few words, that I may not be tedious to you
by an over-long Relation. Those of these
Orders, who profess a strict and austere Rule,
<PB N="53" REF="39"/>
complain that the Rigor of their observance
exhausts and flats their Spirits, and makes them
in a manner wholly incapable of applying them∣selves
to Study, and that their time is too much
shortned by that, which they call the</HI> Divine
Office, <HI>to be able to do any good at it.</HI> How
is it possible for me to Study? <HI>said a Reformed
Religious to me,</HI> I must rise at midnight to go to
Mattins, which continue two hours and an half.
After which I return to my Cell, to see if I can
take some rest, my Head being much disordered,
with the unseasonable breaking of it: About an
hour or two after, I am fain to rise again, to go
and meditate, and sing that which they call <HI>Prime.</HI>
This done, we are sent to Work in a Garden,
there to Dig and Delve for near two hours more;
after which we must go to sing the <HI>Terce,</HI> and High
Mass. This done, we go to Dinner, which is fol∣lowed
with an hour of Recreation; the rest of the
Day, is taken up in going three times more to the
Church, there to sing the <HI>Nones, Vespers</HI> and <HI>Com∣plies,</HI>
so that we can never have three quarters of
an hour together to our selves. For my part, <HI>said
he,</HI> I render thanks to God, that I understood a
little Latin, before I ever entred into this Religi∣ous
Order, which makes me at present to under∣stand
a little of my Breviary; but the most of my
Brethren scarcely understand one word of it, and
sing like so many Asses, without knowing what
they say; and much less do they know what Phi∣losophy
or Theology meaneth. They say that these
kind of Studies are very dangerous to Salvation,
<PB N="54" REF="40"/>
and fill Men with Pride and Vanity. For our parts,
we are sure that by obeying our Superiors, we shall
go to Paradise, without troubing our Heads before∣hand,
to know what kind of place it is. <HI>This
was the Reasoning of this poor Monk; and
he was so far from lamenting, as he ought,
the Misery of his Condition, which deprived
him of so great a Treasure, as is that which is
the product of Study, that he insulted over,
and despis'd Learning; it being but too natural
to the most part of Men, to endeavour to
abase and undervalue that, out of a kind of
maliciousness of heart, which their folly or
weakness will not suffer them to obtain.</HI></P>
<P>But forasmuch as there are but few Religi∣ous
Orders in <HI>Italy,</HI> where this exact Observance
is practised; so we find other Religious, who
have much more time to themselves, and that
are altogether of a different humour. And
forasmuch as the most part of these, are either
of the Order of S. <HI>Dominick,</HI> or S. <HI>Francis,</HI> we
may with respect to their Doctrin, di∣vide
them into <HI>Thomists</HI> and <HI>Scotists.</HI> The for∣mer
of these, follow the Doctrin of S. <HI>Thomas
Aquinas,</HI> who was a <HI>Dominican.</HI> This <HI>Thomas</HI>
stuck close to <HI>Aristotle</HI> in matters of Philoso∣phy,
and studied his Divinity at <HI>Collen,</HI> under
<HI>Albertus Magnus</HI> of the same Order. He un∣dertook
afterwards, by the subtilty of his Spi∣rit,
to reconcile <HI>Aristotle</HI> with S. <HI>Paul,</HI> forcing
that Pagan Philosopher in a manner, to be∣come
a Christian, and what is yet more won∣derful,
<PB N="55" REF="40"/>
a Papist, in spite of all the aversion he
had to these novel Doctrins.</P>
<P><HI>Aristotle</HI> was fallen into great Decadence,
and Neglect in S. <HI>Thomas</HI> his time, and 'tis to
him therefore, they attribute the Glory of
having as it were, raised him from the Dead,
according to that saying, <HI>Sine Thoma mutus
Aristoteles, Without</HI> Thomas, Aristotle <HI>is Dumb.</HI>
Having addicted himself very much to the
reading of S. <HI>Paul,</HI> he could not avoid <HI>gratui∣tous
Predestination,</HI> nor <HI>efficacious Grace,</HI> which
he strongly maintained, shewing himself very
inventive and dexterous at splitting a Hair in
his way of handling Scholastick matters, and
particularly the Points that respect <HI>Transub∣stantiation.</HI></P>
<P>Pope <HI>Urban</HI> IV. who instituted the Feast of
the Holy Sacrament, ordered him to apply
himself to the composing of an Office for it.
The Papists greatly admire the Hymn, he
made on that Subject, and more particularly
the Prose, which to this day is Sung at the
Mass. It is full of the Rapsodies and contra∣dictions,
which the Papists at present do be∣lieve
on that Subject. And he himself owns,
about the midst of the said Prose, that what
he saith of it is incomprehensible, doth not
fall under the Senses, and is contrary to, or
beyond the order of natural things.</P>
<Q><PB N="56" REF="41"/>
<L>Quod non capis, quod non vides,</L>
<L>Animosa firmat Fides, praeter rerum ordinem.</L>
<L>What thou dost not understand, and what thou
dost not see,</L>
<L>Courageous Faith confirms, beyond the course of
things that be.</L></Q>
<P>I am astonished how he durst assert that it is
Faith alone, that assures us of it; for as subtil
as he was, 'tis evident that in his Searching,
he himself was very doubtful, whether what
he had writ on this Subject, was true or no.
This Passage of his seems too remarkable to be
past by, without giving you an occasion of
making some Reflexion upon it. To this pur∣pose
I shall relate to you, what <HI>Ribadeneira</HI>
tells us of it, in his <HI>Legends,</HI> in the Life of
S. <HI>Thomas Aquinas.</HI></P>
<P>Notwithstanding, saith he, S. <HI>Thomas</HI> in his
Explication of other matters, goes beyond all other
Doctors; yet in the point of this ineffable Sacra∣ment
and Divine Sacrifice, he surmounts and out∣vies
himself, as may be seen in his Works, and in
the Office he composed at the command of Pope
<HI>Urban IV.</HI> for the Celebration of the Feast of the
Holy Sacrament. This thorny and difficult Questi∣on,
having been once canvas'd in the University of
<HI>Paris,</HI> concerning the Accidents of Bread and Wine,
which continue there visible after the Conversion of
the Substance to which they belong, into that of the
<PB N="57" REF="41"/>
Body and Blood of Jesus Christ, and which
are called the Sacramental Species or Kinds: S <HI>Tho∣mas,</HI>
(to whom they had all referr'd themselves,)
writ to them his thoughts of this Question, upon a
Paper, which he laid upon the Altar; and having
his Eyes and Heart fixed upon a Crucifix which was
there, he beseeched him most earnestly, that if he
had writ the Truth, he would be pleased to do him
the Favour to tell it him; and if not, that he would
please to stop and hinder it. And as he was in
the greatest Fervour of his Prayer, Jesus Christ
shewed himself visibly unto him upon the Altar,
and said to him, You have writ this well, <HI>Thomas.</HI>
The Saint continuing his Prayer, being Prostrate
on the Ground, his Body was lifted up into the
Air, and continued so, hovering there for a good
while, in the Presence of many Religious of the
Convent.</P>
<P>At another time, when he composed the Office of
the Romish Church, which they sing on the day of
the most Holy Sacrament, being then in the City
of <HI>Orvieto,</HI> a Crucifix spake to him, the same
words, which Crucifix is to this day called S. <HI>Tho∣mas</HI>
his Crucifix. The same hapned to him also at
<HI>Naples;</HI> as he was writing the Third part of his
Sum, the Crucifix which was upon the Altar, spake
to him with a loud and intelligible Voice, saying,
Thomas, <HI>thou hast well writ concerning me;
What will thou that I give thee for thy Re∣ward?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="42"/>
Thus far are the Words of <HI>Ribadeneira</HI> the
Jesuit, in his Legend, which is so highly ap∣proved
by the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> Upon all
which, I desire you to make this Reflexion,
That if S. <HI>Thomas</HI> had not been doubtful of
what he wrote, he would not have had re∣course
to so many Crucifixes, to be confirm'd
and assur'd in his own mind; for otherwise it
would have been an open tempting of God,
as it would surely be, if at present we should
desire Miracles of him, to prove to us the Re∣surrection
of his Son Jesus Christ. And if
S. <HI>Thomas</HI> doubted of this matter, it follows,
that he was convinced, that these things were
not solidly ratified in the Gospel, or in the
Doctrin of S. <HI>Paul,</HI> or at least could not be
deduc'd thence, as natural and necessary Con∣sequences.
Wherefore then doth he say in his
Prose, <HI>Animosa firmat Fides,</HI> that Faith con∣firms
these matters? Men have begun in these
latter Ages, to recover a little from these Ap∣paritions
of Jesus Christ, and from these
speaking Crucifixes: But <HI>Thomas Aquinas</HI> had
Wit enough, at that time, to discern that his
novel Doctrin did stand in need of such
Proofs. True it is also, that probably he
might have imagined it; for his assiduous Ap∣plication
and Meditation of matters purely
Metaphysical, had made him extreamly ab∣stracted
and Hypocondriacal; and to make
use of the Expressions of him, who hath com∣posed
his Encomium, <HI>He was so extatical and
<PB N="59" REF="42"/>
so insensible, that he seemed rather a Statue than
a Man. Insomuch that whilst he was a writing
his Books of the Trinity, a Candle burnt his hand,
without his feeling of it: And that which is yet
more wonderful is, that he fell into these Extasies
and Ravishments, how and when he would him∣self.</HI></P>
<P>The same Author in most pious Terms re∣lates
a very pleasant thing of him, and which
shews the great abstraction of Spirit, in which he
was at times. He saith, that S. <HI>Thomas</HI> at a time,
sitting at Table with S. <HI>Lewis,</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI>
who made him to Dine with him, out of the
great respect he bore to him and his Order;
without minding what he did, or in whose
Company he was, he thump'd with his Hand
upon the Table, saying, <HI>I am sure, the</HI> Mani∣chees
<HI>will never be able to answer this Argument.</HI>
The Prior who was there with him, pull'd
him by his Gown, and put him in mind that
he was at the King's Table; whereupon he
came to himself again, as one that was re∣turned
from the other World, and asked Par∣don
of the King for his Indiscretion. This
puts me in mind of a like Action of his in Pre∣sence
of the Duke of <HI>Mantua;</HI> He had swal∣lowed
a Fly, and having almost immediately
let it escape again, he made a most fearful
outcry, and a thousand frustraneous efforts to
catch it again, without considering that he
was in his Masters Presence. I don't pretend
by all this, to imply that <HI>Thomas Aquinas</HI> was
<PB N="60" REF="43"/>
a Fool; but on the contrary do affirm, that he
had a great stock of Wit; yea, and it may be
was over-stock'd with it; but withal, that he
had (as many topping Wits have) many bad
Intervals. The only thing I am astonish'd at,
is, that they would needs make a Saint of him,
and extol that for an act of Heroical and
transcendent Vertue, which indeed was a for∣mal
Disobedience to the declared Will of his
Mother, and of those that had the Authority
over him, and this when he was yet a young
Child. Moreover, I was willing by the way
to make this short Digression, to give you some
kind of Idea of the Man, whom the Papists
dignifie with the Name of <HI>The Angel of the
Schools; The Hammer of Hereticks, &amp;c.</HI> This is
he that is the Head of that great Party called
<HI>Thomists,</HI> whereof the chiefest are the <HI>Domi∣nicans.</HI></P>
<P>Another Party, no whit less considerable, is
that of the <HI>Scotists. John Duns</HI> a <HI>Scotch-man,</HI>
and who upon that account was Sirnamed
<HI>Scotus,</HI> was the Head of them. He was of the
Order of S. <HI>Francis,</HI> and lived about the latter
end of the <HI>Fourteenth Century.</HI> He at first fol∣lowed
the Opinions of S. <HI>Thomas,</HI> and taught
them publickly: But his Scholars having one
day Reproached him, That he said nothing,
but what <HI>Thomas</HI> had said before him, <HI>Nihil
dicis quod non dixerit</HI> Thomas; he was touch'd
to the quick with this Reproof, and having a
good opinion of his own Ability, he told
<PB N="61" REF="43"/>
them, That for time to come they should
hear such things from him, as <HI>Thomas</HI> never
said. From that time forwards he affected to
contradict him in every thing: Because <HI>Thomas</HI>
(for Example) was for <HI>Efficacious Grace,</HI> he
invented another sort of Grace, which came
nearer to that of the <HI>Semi-Pelagians,</HI> than to
the Grace of S. <HI>Austin,</HI> whom <HI>Thomas</HI> followed
in this Point. And in the Sacrament, because
<HI>Thomas</HI> would not have the Body of Christ
to be there with its natural Quantity, but only
after a definitive manner; <HI>Scotus</HI> asserted the
contrary, and said, That his Body was there
with its whole Quantity. But because he durst
not save himself by maintaining, That the
Body of Christ in the Sacrament had an ex∣tension
of Place, as being repugnant to Sense
and Reason; his Subtilty put him upon in∣venting
another sort of Quantity, which he
determines to be an Extension of Parts in
themselves, <HI>Extensio partium in ordine ad se:</HI>
By which means he made the Generical Quan∣tity
of the <HI>Thomists,</HI> to be only a Species of his.
This Distinction indeed was very subtil; yea, so
subtil, that probably <HI>Scotus</HI> did not understand
it himself. For how can it be conceived, that a
Body should be extended in it self, without
being so with respect to Place? I have con∣versed
with many <HI>Scotist</HI> Doctors, who pro∣fessed
to hold this Opinion from their subtil
Doctor, yet had not Subtilty enough to explain
it. This same <HI>Scotus</HI> died, being only 35 years
of Age.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="44"/>
I do not pretend here to run through all
the Oppositions of his Doctrin to that of
<HI>S. Thomas.</HI> The only Reflexion I could wish
might be made upon it, is this, That the Popes
dare not declare themselves more in favour of
the one than of the other, for fear of incensing
one of both these Parties, who are become so
powerful in the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> However
it is evident, that these Doctrins being diame∣trically
opposit and contradictory one to the
other in most of the Points, it's impossible they
should be both true, and consequently one of
those great Parties must needs be in an Error. The
<HI>Romish</HI> High Priests, who boast themselves to
be <HI>Infallible,</HI> ought (as it seems to me) for the
Love alone which they owe to Truth, to
pronounce their Decisive Rules concerning
this kind of Controversies; but by Ill-hap these
two Parties are too strong for them, and they
would be in danger by pulling down one of
them, to be themselves buried under the Ruins.
They rather chuse, seeing both Parties do own
the Papal Authority, to let them both alone.
<HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Calvin</HI> said nothing concerning
<HI>Efficacious Grace</HI> and <HI>Free-Will,</HI> but what the
Disciples of S. <HI>Austin</HI> and the <HI>Thomists</HI> held,
and still hold to this day, tho' under Terms that
are somewhat differing, but signifie the same
thing: Yet the Council of <HI>Trent</HI> condemned
the former, thereby endeavouring to aggravate
and to render odious (by the Citation of a
great number of Errors) persons that had
<PB N="63" REF="44"/>
lifted up themselves against the Holy See.
<HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Scotus</HI> are not only different in
Opinions; but we find also, that their Fol∣lowers
are at great Variance amongst them∣selves.
There are no less than three or four
sorts of <HI>Thomists,</HI> who every one of them pre∣tend
to have Reason on their side, in the Ex∣plications
they put upon S. <HI>Thomas;</HI> and the
<HI>Scotists</HI> do as much by their <HI>Scotus.</HI></P>
<P>What I have here related concerning those
two Authors, and their Adherents, and what
before I mention'd concerning the <HI>Molinists,</HI>
or <HI>Jesuits,</HI> and the <HI>Augustinians,</HI> agrees gene∣rally
to all those who profess to follow them,
in whatsoever Country they may be. But to
apply this more particularly to the <HI>Italians,</HI> I
shall tell you, that they differ in nothing
from others on those Points, save only in this,
That they do not trouble themselves to search
to the bottom of them, except some particular
occasion, and where their own Glory, or
that of their Order is concerned, engage them
to it. They are too great lovers of their Re∣pose
and Pleasures, to concern themselves with
Theological Notions: And they are the Monks
that have invented that way of Disputing
which I have mention'd, where I speak of
their Universities. They must shew them the
Arms they intend to fight them with, and
point them to the Parts they design to make
their Thrust at, that they may be spared for
their own defence.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="45"/>
There hapned once upon this account a
great Disorder at <HI>Bononia,</HI> whilst I was there:
A <HI>Dominican</HI> Father, who was a <HI>French</HI> Man,
had been desired to oppose in the Grand Con∣vent
of the <HI>Dominicans</HI> at <HI>Bononia,</HI> where he
was arriv'd some days before from Foreign
Countries. He being not over-well acquainted
with their Customs, after that he had chosen
the <HI>Theses</HI> he would dispute against, and com∣municated
his Arguments, a desire took him
to change his <HI>Medium,</HI> which did so extreamly
confound the poor Defendant, who was not
prepar'd for it, and whose Stock was not
sufficient to remedy such an unlook'd for Ac∣cident,
that he Answered quite wrong, and
set all the Company a Laughing; resembling
herein a certain person I have heard of, Who
being sent to take his Orders, without under∣standing
a word of Latin, and had only got
by Heart so many Answers in order, as the
Bishop (who was no Conjurer) was commonly
used to ask Questions; but being confounded
in Marshalling his Answers, was at last reduc'd
to say, <HI>That he had the Devil in his Sleeve, instead
of his Letters Patents;</HI> which he suppos'd the
Bishop had by his Question demanded of him.
The same thing hapned to this poor <HI>Dominican,</HI>
who defended the <HI>Theses;</HI> but soon after all,
the Storm fell upon the <HI>French-men.</HI> The
Scholars, who were all of them young Reli∣gious,
were so extreamly enrag'd at this
Affront, which they pretended to have been
<PB N="65" REF="45"/>
offer'd to their Colleague, that they had no
patience to stay till the Dispute was ended,
but run away from the place like so many
Mad-men, to the Chamber of this poor Stran∣ger,
and having broke down the Door, they
tore to pieces several Turbans of Silk, and
other Curiosities he had brought with him
from <HI>Constantinople.</HI> After this, having watched
him at the Door of the Hall, where the Dis∣putation
had been held, One of them, as he
came forth, gave him a great Box on the Ear;
telling him, <HI>He had best learn another time, to
put his Arguments in Form and Figure.</HI> See here
in the mean time, the Inconveniences to which
the <HI>Italians</HI> expose themselves. They are the
<HI>Monks</HI> also who have introduced Feasts at the
end of their Disputes, and the sumptuous
Adorning of the Hall where they are cele∣brated;
and in these Particulars indeed it is
they surpass all others.</P>
<P>It may generally be said of the <HI>Italians,</HI>
That they are never excellent in those Studies
that require a constant and serious Applica∣tion;
as on the contrary, there be very few
can equal them in all others, which of them∣selves
do afford Diversion and Pleasure. The
greatest part of <HI>Monks</HI> in the Convents apply
themselves to learn to Sing, or Play upon
Instruments: Some addict themselves to Poetry,
in order to make Compositions and Sonnets in
Praise of their Saints, which they expose on
Festivals in their Churches; and they are won∣derful
<PB N="66" REF="46"/>
good at it. In the Abby of S. <HI>Michael
in the Wood,</HI> where I Taught at <HI>Bononia,</HI> the
Abbot sent for a Dancing and a Fencing-Master,
to teach his Religious. I thought this
very strange for <HI>Monks;</HI> and one day I took
the freedom to declare my Thoughts of it to
the Abbot. The Prelat Answered me, That
there was no hurt in all this, and that they did
it for a good End. <HI>For</HI> (said he) <HI>in the first
place, we sometimes act some little Tragedies and
Comedies in the Vestry, or in the Church, to which
we Invite our Kindred of both Sexes, and our
Friends, to be merry together. Now, you know
very well, that in the Interludes there is alway
expected something of Boufonry; and sometimes a
little Ball, or a French-Dance, are very agreeable
to the Ladies; and indeed, if a man cannot Dance
well, he exposeth himself to Laughter, and our
Colleagues become the less esteemed, who being all
of them Children of Persons of Quality, ought
not upon that very account to be ignorant of this
kind of genteel Exercises.</HI> The Abbot in giving me
this account, took notice of some sort of In∣dignation
on my Brow when he told me, that
they made use of the Church to act their
Farces and Comedies in; and therefore would
needs excuse himself on that Point, by telling
me, That they were in a manner forc'd to serve
themselves of that place, because the Ladies
were not suffer'd to enter the Convent, so
that they had no other place where to bestow
them; as if forsooth it were a case of abso∣lute
<PB N="67" REF="46"/>
and insuperable necessity for the Ladies to
be present, or for them to act such kind of
Follies. Sometimes also they are guilty of
most horrible Profanations, by building their
Theatre upon the High-Altar where their
Holy Sacrament is lodg'd.</P>
<P>The Abbot further endeavouring to satisfie
me, past over to another Reason, which ap∣pear'd
somewhat more witty. <HI>My Religious,</HI>
said he, <HI>have all of them (as you know) great
Pensions, and we cannot hinder them from spending
their Mony, as they please themselves. Now, I
should be very loath, that they should employ it (as
so many others do) in keeping their Whores: This
is that which makes me cast about continually, by
what means I may most dexterously get it out of
their hands without offending them, by making
them expend it upon other uses. 'Tis in this view
that I exhort them, to learn all manner of Exer∣cises;
as to Dance, to Ride the Great Horse, and
to handle their Arms. They pay their Masters
themselves, and by this means their Purses are
drained.</HI> The Abbot suppos'd he had found a
very plausible pretext, for allowing his Monks
this liberty; tho' in the mean time others in
the City openly flouted at it, as finding good
reason to be against the Religious, spending
their time in Exercises so little becoming Mo∣nastick
Gravity. It is to be observed, that all
these young Religious were then engaged in a
course of Studies, but it was not possible to
keep them intent upon them; and scarcely
<PB N="68" REF="47"/>
with all the pains taking in the World was it
possible to bring them to any thing, so strangly
were they taken up with their vain Exercises.
See here in what manner the <HI>Italian</HI> Youth
spend their time in the Cloisters; and without
doubt at this rate, they cannot but stand in
need of having the Arguments of their Op∣ponents
communicated to them, before they
come to Dispute against them on publick Oc∣casions.
I should scarce ever make an end,
should I go about to relate all the ridiculous
Occupations that divert them from their Stu∣dies.</P>
<P>I shall shut up this Treatise of Studies with
those of some Secular Priests, who never
having had the means or inclination to go
and study at the Universities, are forced, or
willing to content themselves with that which
they have learnt with the Jesuits. The shortest
way they have to arrive at their end, which
is to be Ordained Priests, is to get by Heart a
little Book called, <HI>Examen Ordinandorum,</HI> the
<HI>Examen of those who are to be Ordained;</HI> which
contains the ordinary Questions that are put
to those that desire to enter into Orders.
The most part of them learn this like Parots,
without understanding the sense of it; being
assured, that no other things shall be asked
them. For Ignorance hath so far prevailed in
the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> that none at these Exami∣nations
are put to it, to shew their Scholarship.
And these Men being once Ordain'd, would
<PB N="69" REF="47"/>
rather be Hang'd (so to say) than ever
after look in a Latin Book, except the <HI>Missal</HI>
and their <HI>Breviary;</HI> and yet it is a rare thing
to find any that are able to explain them.
They abandon the Trade of Preaching to
the Monks, as I have already declared in my
LETTERS; and for their part, they content
themselves to say their Masses, to gad to Bap∣tisms,
and Burials.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, and a thing known to all
<HI>Italy,</HI> that Bishopricks and good Benefices, Ec∣clesiastical
Employments and Offices are not
bestowed upon Men of Learning; but upon
those who have most Friends, who can best
please and flatter, or who being Rich, are in
a condition to make the best advances. The
case is very different in <HI>England,</HI> where the
Bishops, and other Dignitaries, are only chosen
from amongst the Doctors, and where their Me∣rit
is chiefly considered. This is the true Reason
why the Ecclesiasticks of <HI>Rome</HI> do so little care
or endeavour to get Learning, as being well
assured that it will stand them in no stead at
all; yea, that their Enemies or Competitors
might take occasion from thence, to render
them suspected. The Abbot with whom I
Travelled the First Days Journy to <HI>Veletre,</HI>
inform'd me of nothing, but what I knew
before, by the description he gave me of the
way of conferring Bishopricks and Benefices,
which commonly fell to the share of the most
Ignorant. I only asked him, what might be
<PB N="70" REF="48"/>
the Reason of this great Disorder? To which
he Answer'd, That he did not know, or rather
durst not tell it me: And for my part, neither
durst I tell him my Thoughts about it in that
Country. But now, that by the Grace of God
I may freely speak my Mind, I shall declare,
that the greatest Secret of all this is, the Resolu∣tion
which the Heads of the <HI>Romish</HI> Church
have taken, to keep the People committed to
their Charge, as much as they can in a profound
Ignorance. The Doctrin of that Church is so
extreamly corrupt; the Contradictions it con∣tains
are so great and many; the Decrees of
the New Councils and Popes, and the Doctrins
of their different Religious Orders are so in∣consistent
and irreconcilable one with the o∣ther;
the use, or rather the commerce and
Trade that is made there of Holy things, or
such as are pretended to be so, is so base and
infamous; the Morals they profess are so low,
wicked and unworthy, that there is no other
way left to keep that Church standing, but by
abasing the Spirits of Men by Ignorance, or
rather by wholly blinding of them, to make
them fall into the Abyss of Error. Now the
best Expedient in order to this is, to make clear
work with whatsoever might encourage the
Studies of Learning, and to set over the People
Ignorant Bishops and Pastors; from which God
preserve all Protestant Churches, and more
especially that of <HI>England.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS
ON A
JOURNY
TO
NAPLES.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The Second Days Journy.</HEAD>
<P>BEing Come to <HI>Veletre,</HI> the <HI>Abbot</HI> took
up his Lodging with one of his Friends,
and I betook my self to an Inn, near
the <HI>Piazza.</HI> My Host asked me if I had not
a mind to see the Ceremony, which was to
be Celebrated the next day at the <HI>Dome,</HI> (so
they call the Cathedral Churches in <HI>Italy;)</HI> he
<PB N="72" REF="49"/>
told me, there was a great Bell to be Baptized,
whereof a great Lord was to be the God-Fa∣ther,
and a Lady of Quality, the God-Mother,
and that there would be a great apperance of
the Nobility, who had been Invited to the So∣lemnity
from all Parts. I had before this
seen Bells Baptized in <HI>France,</HI> but because I
knew that the <HI>Italians</HI> surpass all other Nati∣ons
in the Magnificence of their Ceremonies,
and that they commonly season them with a
double proportion of Superstition; I resolv'd
with my self to see it Baptized, and with that
design I staid all the next day at <HI>Veletre.</HI> I
went to the Church in the Morning, to take a
view of the Preparatives, that had taken up a
whole Weeks time, which I found to be great
and Sumptuous indeed. The Bell was placed
at the Lower end of the Body of the Church,
hanging upon two Gudgeons, covered with
rich Hangings of Velvet, of a Violet Colour,
and the Bell it self, was accoutred with a
kind of Robe of the same Stuff. There were
two Theaters Built on each side of it, for the
Musicians, and an Amphitheater for the La∣dies,
who were to be present at the Ceremony.
The Pillars and Walls of the Church were
richly adorned, with curious sheets of Silk,
and Pictures. Near to the Bell, was Erected
an Altar, very neatly set forth, and upon it
lay a white Satin Robe, which was to be put
upon the Bell, as soon as it should be Baptiz∣ed,
with a great and fair Garland of choice
<PB N="73" REF="49"/>
Flowers: There was also upon the Altar a Ro∣man
Ritual, a Censer, and a Vessel with Holy
Water, and round about the Altar, rich Vel∣vet
Elbow-Chairs, for the Priests, who were
to perform the Ceremony. Just over-against
it, a Throne was seen most Magnificently
Hung, for the God-Father and God-Mother
of the Bell. About Ten of the Clock the
Company came, and having taken their seve∣ral
Places, the Priests began their Function.
He who officiated was a Bishop <HI>in partibus,</HI>
whom the Bishop of <HI>Veletre,</HI> being at that
time very Sick, had deputed for this purpose,
and his Chair was placed upon the Steps of
the high Altar. He struck up the first Psalm,
which was continued by the Musick. These
Psalms, by the way, which may be seen in
the Roman Ritual, have as much reference to
the Baptizing of a Bell, as to the Baptizing of
the Moon; the Prophet <HI>David,</HI> very proba∣bly
having never had the least notion of the
Baptism of Bells. After that the Psalms were
ended, the Bishop began the Blessing of Holy
Water, to Sanctifie it in the first place, to the
end that afterwards it might Sanctifie the Bell
also. This Benediction is very long, and no
less Ridiculous; which being Finished, the Bi∣shop
and Priests dipt Spunges in it, with which
they rub'd over the Bell, from the top to the
bottom, within and without, being in this re∣gard,
certainly much better Baptized, than
Children are, upon whose Heads only they
<PB N="74" REF="50"/>
pour or sprinkle a little of it. They repeated
in the mean time abundance of Prayers, which
speak of nothing else but Heavenly Blessings,
that are to Purifie, Sanctifie, and Consecrate
the Bell; <HI>Ut hoc Tintinnabulum,</HI> say they, <HI>coe∣lesti
Benedictione perfundere, purificare, sanctifi∣care
&amp; consecrare digneris. That thou wouldest
be pleased to Rinse, Purifie, Sanctifie, and
Consecrate this Bell, with thy Heavenly Benedicti∣on.</HI>
The Bell being thus well washt, they dri∣ed
it with clean Napkins; and the Bishop
having taken the Viol of Holy Oils, which
are those they bless on Holy Thursday, for
the whole year following, he therewith a∣nointed
the Cross of Metal, which is on the
top of the Bell, in order to make the Devils
flee at the Sound or Ringing of it: <HI>Ut hoc au∣dientes
Tintinnabulum tremiscant &amp; fugiant, ante
Crucis in eo depictum vexillun: That hearing this Bell
they may tremble and flee, before the Banner of
the Cross designed upon it.</HI> He afterwards made
seven other Crosses with the said Oil, upon
the outside of the Bell, and four on the inside.
This done, he made the God-Father and God-Mother
draw near, and demanded of them
in <HI>Italian,</HI> Whether they were the Persons
that Presented this Bell to be Consecrated?
Who having answered that they did; he then
asked them, Whether the Metal of the Bell,
and the Workmanship of it, had been paid
for to the Artificers? To which they answer∣ed,
Yea. They make this demand, because it
<PB N="75" REF="50"/>
hath sometime hapned, that for want of Pay∣ment,
the Workmen have seiz'd and fetch'd
away their Bells, the very same day, or the
day after it hath been Baptized, and have
melted them down, to be employed to Pro∣fane
uses. The third Question he asked of
them, was, Whether they believed all that
the Catholick, Apostolick, Roman Church
believes, concerning the Holiness and Virtue
of Bells? The answer to which was affirma∣tive
also. In the Last place, he demanded
of them, what Name they desired should be
put upon the Bell? To which the Lady an∣swered,
<HI>Mary.</HI> Then the Bishop took two
great silk Ribbands, which had been fastned
to the Gudgeons of the Bell, and gave each
of them one in their Hands, and pronounced
with a Loud Intelligible Voice, the words of
Consecration, which are these: <HI>Consecretur &amp;
Sanctificetur Signum istud, in nomine Patris &amp; Filii
&amp; Spiritus Sancti,</HI> Amen. <HI>Let this Sign be Conse∣crated
and Sanctified in the name of the Father, Son,
amd Holy Ghost, Amen.</HI> Then turning him∣self
to the People, he said, The Name of this
Bell is <HI>Mary.</HI> Afterwards he takes the Censer,
and Censeth it on the out-side round about,
and afterwards put the Censer under the Bell,
filling it with Sacred Fumes, and repeating all
this while Prayers and Invocations, that it
might be filled with the Dew of the Holy Spi∣rit.
<HI>Tu hoc Tintinnabulum Spiritus Sancti rore
perfunde, ut ante sonitum illius semper fugiat Bono∣rum
<PB N="76" REF="51"/>
Inimicus. Do thou all besprinkle this Bell
with the Dew of thy Holy Spirit, that at the sound
of it, the Enemy of all good may always take his
Flight.</HI> The Office was carried on with a
great number of Psalms, which they repeated;
the Musick all the while performing wonders;
and then the Bishop, for to shut up the whole
Ceremony, arrayed the Bell with the white
Robe of a Proselyte or Convert, and with a
loud Voice read the Gospel of <HI>Mary</HI> and <HI>Mar∣tha:</HI>
I supposed at that time, that the reason
of their reading this Gospel, was, because the
Bell was called <HI>Mary;</HI> but I have seen since
in the Roman Ritual, that the same Gospel is
read at the Consecration of all Bells, whatso∣ever
their Names be. This is that I am asto∣nisht
at, because that Gospel hath no reference
at all to the Ceremony. The whole Solemni∣ty
being thus ended, the Bishop gave his Bene∣diction,
and the Priests received great Pre∣sents
from the God-Father and God-Mother.</P>
<P>The Doctrin of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> con∣cerning
Bells, may be reduced to the follow∣ing
Points. The First is, that they have Me∣rit,
and pray God for the Living and the
Dead. Secondly, That they do produce, by
a Divine Virtue conferr'd upon them, Devo∣tion
in the Hearts of Believers. Thirdly,
That they drive away Storms and Tempests;
and in the Fourth place, drive away Devils.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="51"/>
Before that I run over these four Points,
Ile tell you a Story that hapned at <HI>Bononia,</HI>
and is of sufficient Antiquity, tho' the memo∣ry
thereof be still preserved fresh and entire.
They had been Baptizing a Bell in the Church
of S. <HI>Proculo,</HI> which is an Abby of <HI>Benedictines,</HI>
and after all the Ceremonies, Benedictions and
Prayers, <HI>that the Bell might do good to all, and
hurt to no body;</HI> the first time of the Ringing
of it, it fell upon the poor Sacristan or Sex∣ton,
that Rung it, and who had taken more
care and pains for the Solemn Baptizing of it,
than to get it well hung and fastned, and broke
his Neck, together with it self into a thousand
pieces. The Name of the Sacristan was <HI>Pro∣culus,</HI>
and this ingenious Distick was made to
Celebrate the Memory of this Accident,
which at this day is found Engraved upon a
Stone, of a Foot Square, near to the Church
Door, where the thing hapned.</P>
<Q><L>Si procul à Proculo Proculi Campana fuisset:</L>
<L>I am procul à Proculo, Proculus ipse foret.</L></Q>
<P>The agreeableness of this Verse cannot be
rendred in <HI>English,</HI> because of the Adverb
<HI>Procul,</HI> which in our Language is not the same,
and therefore will not comport with the allu∣sion;
but the Sense of it, as well as it can be
rendred is this: If the Bell of S. <HI>Proculus</HI> had
been far from <HI>Proculus, Proculus</HI> would at pre∣sent
<PB N="78" REF="52"/>
be far from <HI>Proculus,</HI> that is, he would not
as yet have been Buried in that place.</P>
<P>I proceed now to the four Prerogatives,
that are attributed to Bells, by those of the
Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> The first seems to me to
smell too rank of Interest, to be so easily
swallowed. I shall not take up my time to
prove to you, that an insensible and material
thing is incapable of either Merit or Prayer;
my design having never been to prove what I
set down, by Theological Arguments, but only
to alledge matters of Fact. If indeed they
Rung their Bells for nought, the Doctrin of
<HI>Rome</HI> might insinuate it self with more ap∣pearance
of Truth: But a Man must pay so
dear, to be partaker of their Merit and Prayers,
that it mars the Plot; and I know not why
the Priests and Monks should not scruple this
Simonio. There are little, midling and great
Bells, and the Mony to be paid for the Ring∣ing
of them, encreases proportionably to the
bigness of the Bells. There is all the reason
in the World indeed, that the Persons that
Ring them should be paid; but why the Priests
should over and above this, receive a conside∣rable
Sum of Mony, I see not. Is it not evi∣dent
that this is some of the Fruit and Reve∣nue
of their novel Doctrin? It seems they
would fain introduce amongst us a new Gos∣pel,
according to which scarcely any but the
Rich should be saved, forasmuch as none but
they, are in a Condition to pay well for the
<PB N="79" REF="52"/>
Graces of God, which these Men tell us they
have at their disposal.</P>
<P>When a Poor Man dies in <HI>Italy,</HI> they bury
him without ever Ringing a Bell, or saying
any Mass for him, except any one out of
Charity will be at the Charges of it for him.
They say the <HI>Spanish</HI> Priests do (as to this par∣ticular)
outvy the <HI>Italians</HI> in Covetousness;
and Persons who have been in <HI>Spain</HI> have
assur'd me, That when a Poor Man dies, they
expose his Body in the most frequented Street
and Thorough-fare of the City, to the end
that the People who go and come, may cast
in some Pieces of Mony for their Interment.
The Priests come ever and anon to see, whe∣ther
the whole Sum be gathered; and, if they
should find so much as one Penny wanting,
they would leave the Body there, to stink and
infect the place, without ever offering to touch
it. See here to what a strange height of Shame
and Infamy Popery hath reduc'd things! I
mean by Popery, all that new Mess of Do∣ctrins,
which only tends to fill the Purse.</P>
<P>The second Point of Doctrin, which is this,
<HI>That the Sound of Bells increaseth the Devotion of
the Faithful,</HI> is built on the same Foundation
as the former, <HI>viz.</HI> Covetousness and base
Avarice, or rather downright Rapin and Rob∣bery.
The more Bells that are Rung at a
Christning, and the longer time they are
Rung, the greater portion of Grace doth the
<PB N="80" REF="53"/>
Infant receive: The more Bells, and the
longer they are rung at a Marriage, the greater
share do the Married Couple obtain of the
Grace of Conjugal Love: The more Bells are
rung at a Burial, and the longer they are rung,
the greater Refreshment and Ventilation doth
the Soul of the Departed receive in the Flames
of <HI>Purgatory,</HI> and the sooner is delivered from
them: The more Bells are rung on a Holy∣day,
and the longer time the Ringing is con∣tinued,
the more the Persons that come to
Church are made partakers of Heavenly
Graces and Blessings. But withal it is to be
noted, that all these <HI>mores</HI> cannot be obtained
without <HI>more Mony.</HI></P>
<P>Proceed we to the Third Point, which is
this, <HI>That Bells (by the Grace which is infused
into them at their Baptismal-Consecration) have
the vertue of dissipating Thunder, of laying High
Winds, driving away Tempests, and calming of
Storms.</HI> There is never a thing in Nature
which produceth any effect, never so little
beyond what is common, but the Papists will
needs make a Miracle of it. The Sound of
Bells, by striking the Air, doth sometimes
dissipate the Clouds; but sometimes also it
splits or breaks them, and makes the Thunder
to fall upon the very Churches or Steeples
where they are rung, as when a Cloud chan∣ceth
to be directly hovering over them. The
former of these effects is a Miracle with the
<PB N="81" REF="53"/>
Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and the Priests serve them∣selves
of it, to give credit to the Benedictions
they bestow upon their Bells; notwithstanding
that it is very evident at the same time, that
the Thunder lights oftner upon Steeples, than
upon any other places, and sometimes melts all
the Bells, which, one would think, might be
sufficient to stop their Mouths for ever on this
Point. There is a Little Bell at <HI>Venice,</HI> in the
Convent of <HI>Capucins</HI> in the <HI>Judeca,</HI> which has
the Vogue of being so miraculous against Tem∣pests;
and the People are so Superstitiously
possest with it, that when there is the least
Storm, if the <HI>Capucins</HI> should chance to neg∣lect
to ring it, the People would not fail to
besiege them in their Convent, and cut them
in pieces. And to the end that all may be
attributed to the Merit of this Bell, they do
not ring it all out, but only Toll it, so that
between each Toll a Man may repeat the
Lord's Prayer three or four times.</P>
<P>It remains, that I speak one word of the
Fourth Vertue, which is that of <HI>Chasing away
Devils.</HI> A Religious <HI>Benedictin</HI> of the Congre∣gation
of <HI>S. Maurus</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> once related to
me a Story, which evidently proves the con∣trary.
It was then not above Three years
ago since it hapned in a Monastery, where he
was at that time. These Monks rise at Two
of the Clock in the Morning, to go and sing
their Mattins and Morning Song. The Devil,
<PB N="82" REF="54"/>
or some Hobgoblin it seems, had taken posses∣sion
of the Bell, and used to Ring the First
Peal, and never fail'd of doing it very exactly
at the Hour, without missing one Minute. He
continued this good Office to the Monastery
for Six years together, so that the Monks found
themselves rid of the trouble of Ringing it.
A vast number of People from the Towns and
Villages thereabouts, believing it to be a Fable
that was told them, had the Curiosity to come
and see this Bell, which Rung of it self at
Two of the Clock in the Morning, without
any one touching it; and they themselves were
irreproachable Witnesses of it. Now it hap∣ned
one Night in Winter, that this officious
Devil rang his Bell three Hours sooner than
ordinary. The Prior of the Monastery, who
was not yet gone to Bed, and was Writing of
Letters, took notice of the Irregularity; and
spelling nothing of good from it, he went
immediately to the Door of the Church, where
he staid for the Religious; who being waked
at the sound of the Bell, and believing that
the time for their Devotions was come, went
to Mattins; but the Prior sent them all back to
their Cells, without suffering any one of them
to enter into the Church, telling them, That
he fear'd the Devil had a mind to play them
some unlucky Trick. Neither was he mistaken
in his surmise; for about half an Hour after
the Roof of the Quire fell down, and would
have buried them all in its Ruins, had they
<PB N="83" REF="54"/>
been there at that time to sing their Mattins.
The Devil had so well guess'd at the time
when that old Roof would fall, that he knew
the Hour and Moment thereof; so that he
had not put himself upon performing this
good Office for them, but only with the
design of doing them a great mischief, if the
Prior had not out-witted him.</P>
<P>To apply this to our Subject: We find here
that the Devil was so far from being frighted
at the Ringing of the Bell, that he Rung it
himself, and made use of it for the bringing
about of his Malicious intent. Leave we then
this Superstition of <HI>Bells</HI> to the Papists, nor
let this hinder us from making use of them,
as commodious Instruments to call Believers
together, to shew Respect to our Dead, and
to be made use upon occasion of Publick Re∣joycings;
yet without believing they can make
us better, and without attributing to insensible
things, the precious Aids and Helps of our
Salvation, which are the Graces which we
receive from God alone, by the Merits of our
Lord Jesus Christ. I feel an unexpressible Joy
to see, that the Protestants of <HI>England</HI> have
so far forgot the Superstitious Practices of the
Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> that it is at present a No∣velty
and strange thing to them, when they
are told of them: But on the other hand; I
cannot bear to see the Papists take occasion
from this forgetfulness, to calumniate those
who have a mind to write or speak of those,
<PB N="84" REF="55"/>
as some of them have done who have said,
That I had impos'd upon them, by relating
several Superstitions of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI>
the Practice whereof they deny. Amongst
other things they have Instanc'd in the Blessing
of Eggs at <HI>Easter:</HI> To which I Answer, That
they might as well have given the Lye to their
<HI>Roman Ritual,</HI> where the said Formular of
Blessing them is found at length in these terms:</P>
<P>Subveniat, quaesumus, Domine, tuae Benedictionis
Gratia, huic Ovorum Creaturae, ut Cibus salubris
fiat Fidelibus tuis, in tuarum gratiarum actione
sumentibus, ob Resurrectionem Domini nostri Jesu
Christi, qui tecum vivit &amp; regnat, &amp;c. Et
aspergat Aqua Benedicta.</P>
<P>In English thus:</P>
<P>Let, we beseech thee, O Lord, the Grace of
thy Blessing succour this Creature <HI>Eggs,</HI> that it
may become wholsom Food to thy Faithful, recei∣ving
them with giving Thanks to thee, for the
Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, who lives
and reigns with thee, &amp;c. And let him besprinkle
them with Holy-Water.</P>
<P>In the said <HI>Ritual</HI> we meet with many other
Blessings, which I have not mention'd, that
are never a whit less ridiculous. We find
there Blessings for Houses, for Ships, for
Swords, for the New Fruits of the Earth, for
<PB N="85" REF="55"/>
the Nuptial Bed, for Asses and for Horses, and
in a word, for all sorts of Beasts that are sick.
And because it's likely the Papists might en∣deavour
to persuade People, that I had im∣pos'd
upon them, as to this last instance. See
here the very words of it, as they are see
down in the Appendix of the <HI>Roman Ritual.</HI></P>
<P>Primo, Animalia aspergantur Aqua Benedictâ;
postea Sacerdos dicat,</P>
<P>Misericordiam tuam, Domine, supplices exoramus,
ut haec animalia, quae gravi infirmitate vexantur,
tuâ Benedictione sanantur, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Aspergantur iterum Aqua Benedictâ.</P>
<P>First, The Beasts must be sprinkled with Holy
Water; and then let the Priest say,</P>
<P>We humbly implore thy Mercy, O Lord, that
these Living Creatures, which are troubled with
great Infirmity, may by thy Blessing be healed, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Let them again be sprinkled with Holy-Water.</P>
<P>I have observed, that in their other Blessings
they use but one Aspersion of Holy-Water;
but that in this they use Two Sprinklings, the
one at the beginning, and the other at the
end of the Benediction. I cannot give you
any Reason for it, except it be, that the Beasts
being greater in bulk, seem to them therefore
to stand in need of a greater Sanctification.
It will not now be look'd upon as a strange
thing, what Dr. <HI>Burnet</HI> hath writ in his Letters
concerning the Blessing of <HI>Asses</HI> and <HI>Horses,</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="56"/>
which he saw in <HI>Italy,</HI> having here given you
the Authentick Form of it, which the Papists
cannot deny.</P>
<P>There is another Observance in the Church
of <HI>Rome,</HI> which is still more ridiculous than
this, which is their Exorcising of <HI>Rats, Cater∣pillars,
Flies,</HI> and all other Insects between the
Feasts of <HI>Easter</HI> and <HI>Ascension.</HI> I my self have
assisted very often, both in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> to
the performing of this Ceremony; and herein
I can say, that I have been among the number
of Fools: True it is, that it was for our Ad∣vantage;
for we were well paid for our pains.
We go from one Farm to another, from one
Country-House to another, and almost upon
every piece of Ground we repeat our Exor∣cisms.
We bespeak all these little Insects, no
otherwise than if they were Reasonable Crea∣tures,
and make use of the Name of God to
Adjure them.</P>
<P>Adjuro vos per Deum Sanctum, per Deum vi∣vum,
per Deum Omnipotentem, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I Adjure you by the Holy God, by the Living
God, by the Almighty God, to depart these Grounds,
and to get you gone to Desert and Waste places,
where you may not be in a condition of hurting
any one, nor the Fruits of the Earth.</P>
<P>(If this be not to take the Name of God in
vain, I don't know what is.) Besides, all
<PB N="87" REF="56"/>
this was nothing, but meer Labour in Vain;
because there was not so much as one poor
Worm or Caterpillar, that offered to budge
from its place for all this puther. When we
were quite tired with Exorcising, we went to
refresh our selves in the first Farm that was
next to us, where the good Country People
did not fail to set before us the best that they
had. We found some amongst them tho',
that were no Fools; They told us, <HI>Sirs, If we
did not take the pains to rid our Trees of the</HI> Cater∣pillars,
<HI>your Exorcisms would stand us in poor
stead.</HI> We reproved them for their want of
Faith, which render'd the pains we took un∣profitable
to them. The most part of the
Peasants, by way of acknowledgment for these
Exorcisms, send all their First-Fruits to the
Priests that have Officiated them, so that
we had always the First-Fruit of every Sea∣son.</P>
<P>I was once Invited by a Noble <HI>Venetian,</HI> to
pass the time of <HI>Vintage</HI> with him in the
Country at his House of Pleasure, Two Miles
from <HI>Rovigo,</HI> in the <HI>Polesiné.</HI> When we arrived
there, there were a kind of Flies, which (as
they said) were fallen from the Sky, and did
much mischief; they suck'd and devour'd all
the Grapes that were not yet ripe. The Noble
<HI>Venetian</HI> desired me to accompany the Curate
of the Parish, in order to Exorcise them;
Accordingly we went thither with five or six
Clergy-men more. The Heat was so excessive
<PB N="88" REF="57"/>
that we were forced to go for shelter into every
House we met with in the Fields. Now it
hapned by Mischance, that he who carried
the Holy-Water, (whether by his having drunk
much, or otherways) fell asleep in a Cellar,
where he was entred to cool himself. We did
not take notice of his not following us, and
we walk'd almost a Mile to a certain Field,
where we were to Exorcise. Here we began
to call for our Holy-Water, without which
nothing was to be done; but the Man was not
to be found, and we were oblig'd to send some
Body to seek for him with all speed. We
staid there near an Hour expecting him, and
during that time the Flies stung us so terribly,
that our Faces and Hands were all of a
Gore-blood; they plainly shew'd by this their
rudeness, that they did not care a Rush
for our Exorcisms, and accordingly in our
own defence, we dispatch'd them as quick,
as possible, and with all expedition return'd
to our first House. These Insects we found
discharged their fury during the Heat of the
Day; for towards Evening one might safely
walk abroad, without being molested by
them. And then it was that we went and re∣commenced
our Exorcisms, tho' without the
least success; for the Flies persisted to make the
same havock as before, until that a continual
Rain of four or five days kill'd and swept
them all away, better than all the Holy-Water
might have done.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="57"/>
I went at another time, during my stay at
<HI>Bononia,</HI> to Exorcise the Insects in the Country,
in Company of a Country Curate, who had
a very Comical Wit. He had always a word
ready to make the Company laugh, and all his
Exorcisms were meer Fancies, or perfect
Drolling. He did not tye himself to the
Ritual, or Form prescrib'd by the <HI>Romish</HI>
Church, but made his Paraphrase upon every
thing; sometimes he spoke to the <HI>Pismires;</HI>
sometimes to the <HI>Grasshoppers;</HI> sometimes he
made his Apostroph's to the <HI>Rats, Lizards,</HI>
and <HI>Worms.</HI> He banish'd them all one after
another, to the Countries which he assign'd
them for the place of their Exile, and re∣legated
the <HI>Moles</HI> to the Antartick Pole,
without once knowing what it was. He had
scarcely pronounc'd the dreadful Sentence, but
a <HI>Mole</HI> came forth out of his Hole; whereupon
the Curate cried out, <HI>Courage, my Friends, look!
there's one of them which is ready to begin his
march.</HI> But the <HI>Mole;</HI> it seems, had no
mind to take so tedious a Journy, and no
sooner had smelt the Oar, but crept into
another Hole near to it, in the same Field.
Then one of the Peasants that was present,
ran to look into the Hole, to which the <HI>Mole</HI>
had betaken himself, and said very innocently,
<HI>What, Sir, is this the Antartick Pole?</HI> We could
not forbear Laughing; and because we saw
that this was diametrically opposite to that
great Gravity, that must more particularly
<PB N="90" REF="58"/>
be affected upon these sorts of occasions, we
desired him to leave off his Drollery; but he
was so habituated to it, that he had much
ado to command himself. His way of Preach∣ing
also was much to the same purpose, which
made, that tho' he was very ignorant, they
stock'd from all the Villages thereabouts, to
have the divertisement of hearing him Preach.
I have been present at many other Exorcisms,
and Benedictions of the Fruits of the Earth.
The Priests are very willing and ready to
officiate or assist at them; forasmuch as it is
an employment both pleasant and profitable
for those that discharge it. For by this
means they take the freedom to enter into all
the Country-Houses of Lords and Gentle∣men,
and into their Gardens, where they
never fail of being well Entertain'd. At the
time of Vintage they go and Bless the Wine
in the Fats; and at <HI>S. Martin,</HI> the Wine in the
Cellars.</P>
<P>I might proceed to relate to you, a great
number of other Benedictions and Exorcisms,
to shew you the Abuse is made thereof by the
Priests of the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> but because I
fear keeping you too long upon one and the
same Subject, I shall chuse rather, to diversifie
it by some other Relation.</P>
<P>I shall take my Subject from a Remark I
made at the Abby of <HI>Fossa Nova,</HI> whither I
Journyed from <HI>Veletre,</HI> after having seen the
<PB N="91" REF="58"/>
Baptizing of the Bell, which I have already
described. This Abby is not far from <HI>Terra∣cine;</HI>
and it was here that <HI>S. Thomas Aquinas</HI>
died, on his Way to the Council of <HI>Lions.</HI>
The Curiosity I had to see the Place where
he was Buried, made me alight; and the
Monks of that Abby, who are <HI>Bernardines,</HI>
shew'd me a great deal of Civility. They led
me to a Little Chapel under-ground, where
they told me that <HI>S. Thomas</HI> was laid after his
Death. I desired them to shew me his Re∣licks;
but they told me, They could not
answer my Request, because his Body had
never been taken up out of the Ground; and
that the Altar of the Chapel was built upon
his Tomb. But for all this fair Story, I knew
very well, that Pope <HI>Urban</HI> the Fifth had be∣stowed
his Body upon the Religious of S. <HI>Do∣minicus,</HI>
who had translated it to their Convent
at <HI>Tholouse;</HI> and what I enquir'd concerning
it of these Monks, was only to discover their
Honesty in the case. I told them also, That
I had seen a <HI>Capucin</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> who had shewed
me a considerable piece of S. <HI>Thomas</HI> his Arm,
which he said, the Fathers of <HI>Fossa Nova</HI> had
bestowed upon him. I gave them a description
of this <HI>Capucin</HI> from Head to Foot, which
made them at last call to mind one that was
a <HI>German,</HI> who after he had Fudled himself
in their Monastery, had with so much Impor∣tunity
requested of them some Relick of
<HI>S. Thomas;</HI> telling them, He was resolved not
<PB N="92" REF="59"/>
to leave their Monastery, till they had given
him one; that at length they were fain to
shew him a great heap of Dead-mens Bones,
which was in a Corner of the Chapel, amongst
which he had chosen the Relick which he
had shewed me. They told me, That
they themselves question'd, whether there
might not be some Relicks of that Saint
amongst all their Bones, because the Earth of
the Chapel had been stirred several times;
and tho' it was precisely believ'd, that the
Body of <HI>S. Thomas</HI> did rest under the Altar,
yet they were not absolutely sure of it. This
is the Reason (said they) why many Persons
have made no difficulty to take some of these
Bones, in the Conceit, that they might pro∣bably
be some of his; or at least in hopes,
that the Presence of the Body of the Saint,
near whom they had the Honour to Rest, might
have communicated to them some Heavenly
Vertue.</P>
<P>To speak the truth, these are the very Rea∣sonings,
which the Gentlemen of <HI>Rome;</HI> I
mean the Pope and Cardinals, make use of
every day, with reference to the Holy Bodies,
which they fetch out of the <HI>Catacombes,</HI>
and which they send so boldly, and so fre∣quently
to places of their Communion, to be
Worshiped there. These <HI>Catacombes,</HI> in the
Sense they take them in, are Subterranean
Places, where Believers assembled themselves
in the times of Persecution; and where they
<PB N="93" REF="59"/>
Buried the Corps of their Martyrs; but they
also indifferently Buried there the Bodies of all
Christians, so that as these places served them
for Temples, or places to meet in, so they
served them also for Church-yards to bury
their Dead. The Popes having in these last
Ages, taken into mature Consideration, the
great gain they reaped from the Bones of their
Saints, had recourse to these places, as to in∣exhaustible
Mines, and indifferently seized all
the Bones they met with there: Yea, their
Avarice lasht out to that degree, that either
not knowing, or not being able to distinguish
the true <HI>Catacombes,</HI> they have gone to search
for dead Bodies in the Common Sewers, or
Subterranean Vaults, which were the Sinks to
carry off the filth of the City, and where in
ancient times they were used to fling the Bo∣dies
of Malefactors, after their Execution.
True it is, that amongst them, were some∣times
found the Bodies of Martyrs, which es∣caped
the knowledge of Christians. The
Popes not having the power to distinguish the
one from the other, and to spare themselves
a trouble, which besides would have been pure
labour lost, by the Power of God himself,
which they profess themselves to have, meta∣morphos'd
them all, <HI>dictum factum,</HI> into Saints.
The Heathens had also Caves and Vaults,
where they caused themselves to be Interr'd
with their whole Families; and the greatest
part of all these Bones, are now upon the Al∣tars
<PB N="94" REF="60"/>
of the Papists, under the name of Saints,
taken up out of the <HI>Catacombes.</HI> And foras∣much
as the Popes are ignorant of their
Names, they baptize them anew, and give
them a Name as best pleaseth them, which is
the cause, why there be found so many Saints
of the same Name. This is also the true cause
of so many Contests and Trials between the
Priests and the Monks, who all pretend in
good time, to be the sole Possessors of the
Primitive Saint, of this or the other Name.
These Trials are to be determined at <HI>Rome,</HI>
by means of Mony, which still inflames the
Popes with a greater Zeal, to send as many as
they can of these Saints into all parts, which
one day or other will not fail to furnish them
with matter for Trials so gainful to them; yea,
we may affirm that there be almost as many
Trials at <HI>Rome,</HI> about Relicks, as about Bene∣ficial
matters. Now the Doctrin which serves
to quiet the Consciences of the Romanists,
from the checks that might torment them, for
having exposed, and still daily exposing such
abominable Filthinesses upon their Altars, is
this, that they believe, that what S. <HI>Paul</HI> saith,
that the unbelieving Wife, is sanctified by the
believing Husband, ought also to be under∣stood
of their Relicks; forasmuch as all the
Bones, which are found in one Vault, are san∣ctified
by their Neighbourhood with those of
one Saint. Or at least, if this won't do,
they betake themselves to their last shift, which
<PB N="95" REF="60"/>
is this, That a good intention is an abundant
excuse for all these petty irregularities in those,
who continue in the bosom of the Church of
<HI>Rome;</HI> so that it is enough according to them,
to have a right intention of honouring such a
Saint, or she Saint, and to receive with Re∣verence
and Obedience the Instruments pro∣posed
to them, for to honour them. They
have propounded such like Arguments to the
Protestants of <HI>France,</HI> to persuade them to go
to Mass. Why do you fear, say they, to a∣dore
the Host, as long as you direct your in∣tention
to Jesus Christ, who in it is worshiped?
For by this means it will be Jesus Christ whom
you shall adore, and not the Bread, supposing
it to be so: Only be obedient to the Church
of <HI>Rome,</HI> and your good intention shall save
you. And they have discoursed them at the
same rate about Relicks.</P>
<P>Now the use, that the Priests and Monks of
the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> do make of these Prin∣ciples,
is this, that there are no Bones whatsoe∣ver,
no not the Bones of an Ass or Horse,
but they may make Relicks of them; they
need only break a piece of them and tell you,
that it is a Relick of one of the Eleven thou∣sand
Virgins that suffered Martyrdom at <HI>Col∣len,</HI>
or else one of the Soldiers of the <HI>Theban</HI>
Legion, who were all cut in pieces at the
passage of the <HI>Alpes,</HI> for refusing to Sacrifice
to <HI>Mars</HI> the Traveller. They may shew you
the Rib of a sucking Pig, and tell you it is a
<PB N="96" REF="61"/>
Relick of one of the little Innocents, who
were Massacred at our Saviours Birth; or
Lastly, tell you that it is the bone of a Saint
taken out of the <HI>Catacombes.</HI> Besides all these,
they can give you many other Categories, un∣der
which their Relicks are commonly ranked
and Marshal'd; and pray how can you con∣tradict
them, as to what they alledge? And as
for them, Good-men, they salve their Con∣sciences,
by the intention they have, of pro∣curing
Honour to such a he or she Saint, for
whom they have the greatest Devotion, or
who suits best with their interest.</P>
<P>I was once in the Abby of the Trinity at
<HI>Vandome</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> when they exposed their
Treasury of Relicks: They shewed us amongst
other things a Jaw-bone, which the Monks
told us was that of S. <HI>Magdalen;</HI> and a very
able Physician, who was present at the same
time, was ready to maintain to their Faces,
and would forfeit his Head, if he did not
prove to them, by the Texture, scaling and
largeness of the Bone, that it never belong'd
to a human Body, but it was the piece of the
Jaw-bone of some Beast or other. But the Fa∣thers
were so far from desiring him to disa∣buse
them in the case, that they presently
pop'd up another Relick, to put him by his
displeasing Discourse. This Relick was that
they call the <HI>Holy Tear,</HI> which is so famous
in that Country. The Tradition they pre∣tend
to have concerning it runs thus, that
<PB N="97" REF="61"/>
when our Saviour wept over <HI>Lazarus,</HI> an An∣gel
gathered up his Tears, in a small Crystal
Vial, and that having preserved them a long
time, he gave them to S. <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> who
was then doing Penance, at a place which is
called <HI>la Sainte Baume,</HI> near to <HI>Marseilles;</HI>
that in process of time, this Relick was carri∣ed
to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> where it continued du∣ring
the Reign of the <HI>Greek</HI> Emperour; and
being afterwards fallen, together with all the
Riches of that great City, into the hands of
the <HI>Turks,</HI> a <HI>Turkish</HI> Emperour presented it
to <HI>Godfrey</HI> Earl of <HI>Vandome,</HI> who deposed it
in this Abby. It seems by this Tradition that
it took many turns, before it came thither,
and above all, that which I consider is, that
it hath past through the hands of Infidels and
Enemies to the Name of Christ. But for
all this, the Roman Catholicks, and above all,
the Monks of that Abby, have not the least
doubt or scruple concerning it; but bestow
upon it the Worship of <HI>Latria,</HI> even the same
they give to Jesus Christ himself. Upon any
extraordinary occasion of great Drought, or
raging Sickness, they carry it solemnly through
the City, and that with greater Pomp than
they do their Holy Sacrament. These Fathers,
who are Reformed <HI>Benedictins,</HI> told us, That
now for so many Hundred years, that is to
say, since the time of our Saviour, the said
Tear had been preserved so fresh, as a Tear
that actually drops from the Eye. We viewed
<PB N="98" REF="62"/>
this Crystal very attentively holding it up a∣gainst
the Light, and afterwards took a re∣view
of it at the Light of a Wax-Taper, but
we could discover nothing of what they were
pleased to tell us. They have recourse to this
Relick in all Maladies of the Eyes, and upon
this account, it brings a vast Income to these
Fathers. Surely People had need to be En∣dowed
with a great Stock of Simplicity and
good Intention to adore things, which even
according to humane Tradition are so uncer∣tain
and doubtful.</P>
<P>We meet with a Story in the Life of S. <HI>Mar∣tin,</HI>
which makes it appear, that this good In∣tention,
was not so generally in vogue in his
time, or at least that the Bishops did not fa∣vour
it, at the rate as those of the <HI>Romish</HI> Com∣munion
do at present. There was a Devotion
got up at some Leagues from <HI>Tours,</HI> towards
certain Relicks, which made a great Noise.
The People ran from all parts thither out of
Dovotion, and they pretended that great Mi∣racles
were wrought upon the Place, and all
manner of Maladies healed. S. <HI>Martin</HI> (as
saith the History of his Life, writ by <HI>Ribade∣neira</HI>
the Jesuit,) went himself thither by way
of Devotion; and being at the Place, he was
seized as it were with a secret Instinct, or
Divine Inspiration, that the Bones which they
Worshiped in that Place, were not the Bones
of Saints. S. <HI>Martin</HI> to be cleared in the Mat∣ter,
adjur'd the Bones to tell him, whose they
<PB N="99" REF="62"/>
were; whereupon (adds the Story) was heard a
terrible Voice proceeding from the Shrine or
Case wherein the Bones lay; which said, <HI>We
are so far from being the Bones of Saints, that we
are the Bones of two miserable Criminals, Mur∣therers
and Robbers on the High-way, who were
executed at such a time publickly for our Crimes;
and yet of a long time have we been here wor∣shiped
as if we had been Gods.</HI> S. <HI>Martin</HI> having
received this Information, immediately com∣manded
the Bones to be cast out upon the
Lay-stall.</P>
<P>Good, GOD! If all the false Relicks, which
at present are ador'd in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI>
had Voices, and could but speak, as these did,
what strange Stories should we hear! Some
would say, We are the Bones of Heathens, or of
Malefactors; others, of Horses, Asses, Dogs, &amp;c.
And yet I question very much, whether after
all this, they would resolve to quit them.
They would say, <HI>It's like that these Voices were
only the Illusions and Artifices of the Devil, who
is envious at the Glory that is bestowed on the
Saints; and that their Church being Infallible,
having propos'd these Relicks to Believers to be
worshiped, She can neither err in matter of Right,
or in Matter of Fact.</HI> See here a true Por∣traicture
of the Spirit of that Church, as it is
at present; being so far changed, I will not say
from that of the Primitive times, but even
from that of the middle Ages, as nothing
more.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="63"/>
But we are to take notice of a distinction
here, which is this, That if any Relick should
chance to be introduc'd by any other way,
but that of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and come to
the knowledge of the Popes, they would never
suffer it. Father <HI>Mabillon</HI> gives us an Instance
of it in his Voyage of <HI>Italy;</HI> for he tells us,
That some <HI>Spaniards</HI> having Addrest them∣selves
to Pope <HI>Urban</HI> the Eighth, to obtain
Indulgences upon the account of a Saint called
S. <HI>Viar;</HI> the Pope being surpriz'd at the No∣velty
and singularity of the Name, would be
informed upon what good ground the Holiness
of this Saint was founded, to whom such
extraordinary Qualities were attributed in
some places: For confirmation of all, they
brought him an Inscription containing these
Letters S. <HI>VIAR.</HI> But the Skilful and Learned
found, that the Inscription was made for a
<HI>Praefectus Viarum;</HI> that is, a Person who had
the care and inspection of the High-Ways
amongst the <HI>Romans.</HI> Wherefore the Pope
forbad them any more to expose this their
Saint; whereas indeed could they have made
out, that this Relick had been bestowed upon
them by one of the Popes, his Predecessors,
the case would have been alter'd; and we
have all the reason in the World to believe,
that to maintain the Honour of the Holy See,
he would never have supprest it as he did.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="63"/>
The <HI>Capucin</HI> whom I had seen at <HI>Rome,</HI>
that had got a Bone of S. <HI>Thomas Aquinas</HI> at
<HI>Fossa Nova,</HI> had already broken it into a thou∣sand
little bits, which he had wrapt up in
pieces of Paper, with a design of distributing
them in his Journy, when he should return to
his own Country. The <HI>Capucins,</HI> and others
who are called <HI>Mendicants,</HI> never carry any
Mony about them, and consequently pay no∣thing
wheresoever they come; but being
look'd upon as men full fraught with Relicks
and <HI>Agnus Dei's,</HI> the Persons who entertain
them, ask some of these to be bestowed upon
them; or rather, they themselves prevent
them, by giving them some of these Presents
before they set any thing before them, as being
assured, that by this means they shall procure
better Treatment from their Hosts.</P>
<P>I have on a thousand Occasions, in the
Company of <HI>Capucins,</HI> seen them distribute a
thousand Relicks; but amongst the rest, I
was once in the <HI>Alpes,</HI> in a Village called
S. <HI>Gothard,</HI> at the foot of a very high and
famous Mountain, which bears the Name of
it. I arrived there at Dinner time, and being
got into an Inn, I perceived two Fathers
<HI>Capucins,</HI> who were warming themselves at a
great Fire, in the best Chamber of the House,
whilst their Dinner was making ready. The
desire I had to meet with Company, made me
entreat my Hostess to endeavour to persuade
them, to let me Dine with them: They very
<PB N="102" REF="64"/>
obligingly consented to my Request; and I
saw that one of the Fathers took the Hostess
aside to a Corner of the Room, and gave her
a Paper very neatly folded up. I could not at
that time imagin what it might be; and soon
after Dinner was brought up. After we had
Dined, the <HI>Capucins</HI> call'd up their Hostess,
and ask'd her what they had to pay? <HI>Truly</HI>
(said the Woman) <HI>as for your part good Fathers,
your Reckoning is easily made; but for this Gentle∣man
here, there is a Crown to pay for his part.</HI>
I found my share to be overreckon'd, and
that the Hostess had a mind to make up the
Expence of her Charity towards these good
Fathers out of my Purse. In the mean time
one of the <HI>Capucins</HI> told her very pleasantly,
that they did not intend to quit her at so
Cheap a Rate, seeing they had bestowed upon
her the most precious Piece in all their Trea∣sury;
but that such a Day, the next Week,
they were to pass by that way again, and
that they hoped she would well weigh and
consider the great worth of the Present they
had bestowed upon her: Which was as much
as to say, That they expected to be once more
plentifully Treated by her, and that accord∣ingly
she would think of providing some good
thing for them against that Day. They began
afterwards, as if they had a mind to insult
over me, for that it had cost me so much,
tho' I far'd no better than they, and that as
for them a small Devotional Present had dou∣bly
<PB N="103" REF="64"/>
satisfied their Hostess, without paying any
thing. I demanded of them, what kind of
Present it was? They told me it was a Relick,
but would not specifie it particularly. This
put me upon making a pretext to go down,
to know of the Hostess what it might be.
As soon as I came down, I sound her very
devoutly presenting the Relick to her Dome∣sticks
in the Kitchin, for them to kiss it. It
was a Tooth forsooth of an old <HI>Box-Comb;</HI> she
shewed it me, with the Paper in which it was
wrapt, whereon was writ with great Letters,
<HI>A Holy Tooth of the Comb, wherewith S.</HI> Martha
<HI>Combed her Head at</HI> Marseilles. I viewed it
very attentively, and as I was going to wipe
off with the end of my Handkerchief, some
filth that was upon it, that I might with the
less aversion kiss it; not that I believ'd the
Relick, but to the end I might not give any
offence to others (for at that time I was a
good <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick) the Hostess would not
let me, and in a kind of Passion told me, That
I was going about to take away the best part
of the Relick, which was the Sweat of
the Saint. I restor'd the gay Relick to my
Hostess, and return'd to my <HI>Capucins.</HI> I told
them, I came from having taken a view of
the Holy Tooth of the Comb of S. <HI>Martha,</HI>
wherewith they had presented the Woman of
the House, as a Recompence for her Treating
of them. I easily perceiv'd, that this Com∣plement
did not please them at all; for having
<PB N="104" REF="65"/>
entreated them to tell me, how they came to
light upon so precious a Treasure; they An∣swer'd
very fiercly, That it was not their
business to give me an account of it. Where∣upon
I also left them, without using much
Ceremony, in order to prosecute my Jour∣ny.</P>
<P>Many <HI>English</HI> Roman Catholicks, cannot
endure to hear, that they bestow their Ado∣rations
upon things that are so very vile and
contemptible; but it is only by reason of their
Ignorance of what passeth in those Countries
where Popery is rampant; for there may be
seen things yet far more ridiculous, such as the
Lanthorn of <HI>Judas;</HI> the Dice wherewith the
Souldiers Cast Lots, which of them should
have Christ's Garment; a Shoe of St. <HI>Joseph;</HI>
Hair, Paring of Nails, and all manner of Ex∣crements
of their Saints and Saintesses. The
Treasuries of their Churches are top fill'd with
these kind of precious Pelicks, and the Pro∣testant
Travellers, may make themselves very
merry in <HI>Italy,</HI> if they will give themselves the
leisure to go and see the Treasures which are
kept in their Churches, and more especially in
the Country, where the <HI>Cupucins,</HI> and other
<HI>Mendicants,</HI> take care to leave great store of
them. At least they may be sure to find there,
those Implements the Papists call <HI>Agnus Dei,</HI>
and almost in every Parish, one of S. <HI>Margarets</HI>
Girdles. Their <HI>Agnus Dei</HI>'s are pieces of white
Wax, upon which is imprinted the Figure of a
<PB N="105" REF="65"/>
little Lamb, carrying a Cross upon his Shoul∣der.
The Popes bless them in the Holy-Week
at <HI>Rome</HI> with abundance of Ceremony, in
memory of the words which S. <HI>John Baptist</HI>
said of our Saviour, <HI>Behold the Lamb of God
which takes away the Sins of the World.</HI> They
believe therefore, conformably to this, that
these <HI>Agnus Dei's</HI> do forgive Sins; at least, those
that are not very heinous ones indeed; and they
almost pay as great respect to them, as they do
to the Host it self: They carry them in Proces∣sion,
they kneel before them, they pray to them;
Secular persons may not touch them with their
Fingers, they must be Priests, or Monks, or Nuns,
to whom the Bishops give this permission and
priviledge. The Nuns make it a great part of
their employment to make Enclosures of Silk
for them, very neatly wrought with a Needle
into all manner of Figures, and then they
bestow them upon such Seculars as Present
them highest, for the Sanctification of their
Souls. And besides the Remission of Sins, they
are over and above very good to preserve a
Roman Catholick from all the evil Accidents
of this Life.</P>
<P>As to what concerns the Girdle of <HI>S. Mar∣garet,</HI>
we are to know, that according to the
Tradition of the Papists, a great Dragon
having offer'd to devour this Saint, she whipt
off her Girdle, and having put it about his
Body, he immediately became as gentle as a
Lamb, and did her no hurt at all. The Priests
<PB N="106" REF="66"/>
of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> hereupon believ'd,
That this Girdle which had tam'd the Dragon,
which they pretend was the Devil himself,
might as well be of efficacy to tame Women,
or rather the Pains they endure in Child-Bed.
Wherefore almost all of them have pieces of
it in their Churches, and some of them pre∣tend
to have the whole Girdle. Insomuch,
that if all the parts of it were joyn'd together,
they would without doubt make a Girdle that
would reach the length of the <HI>Strand,</HI> or of
<HI>Cheapside</HI> in the City of <HI>London.</HI> They are the
Priests and Monks themselves that carry it to
Women Great with Child: 'Tis they them∣selves
put it about their Bodies, repeating cer∣tain
Supplications and Prayers; and whilst they
are performing this Function, all the Company
must withdraw out of the Room. If the
Woman chance to be Delivered before the
Girdle comes, there's no hurt done, for her
Deliverance in this case is attributed to the
Vow she has made to the Girdle; but if she
happens to die, then it is, because she was too
backward and negligent in sending for it;
and if it happens as sometimes it does, that she
dies between the Hands of the Priests, having
the Girdle actually about her; in this case the
Priests very devoutly sneak away with their
Girdle, and lay it up again in their Chapel,
without saying any thing but this, that there
is no obviating the orders and course of Provi∣dence.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="66"/>
The Priests have brought things to that pass
in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> that nothing can be
done without them; they must be present
every where with their Relicks, their Holy
Oils, and their Holy Water. Their Benedi∣ction
of the Marriage-Bed, is a Ceremony
that deserves our speaking a word or two of
it. The Priests go in the Evening to Bless the
Bed of the Married Couple, before they Bed
together, in the same manner as God blessed
all Living Creatures, after their Creation, giving
them the virtue of <HI>Increasing and Multiplying.</HI>
After that they have bestowed their Holy
Water, they have good Wine presented them
to drink, and they help to put the Bridegroom
and Bride to Bed. What think you, Sir; Are
not these very modest and becoming Occupa∣tions
for Men that profess Chastity?</P>
<P>I have made mention of all these Benedi∣ctions,
upon occasion of that of the Eggs at
<HI>Easter,</HI> which some Ignorant Papists, and little
vers'd in their Ceremonies had denied; and
if any should be found to deny any of these
here mentioned, we are ready to shew 'em
them in the <HI>Roman Ritual.</HI> I have also made
mention of some Relicks upon occasion of
that of <HI>S. Thomas Aquinas,</HI> which the Monks of
<HI>Fossa Nova</HI> pretend to have in their Abby.
I shall now continue my Journy towards <HI>Ter∣racinne,</HI>
where I arrived very late; and part∣ing
thence again betimes in the Morning, I
had no leisure to examine any thing there
<PB N="108" REF="67"/>
about Religious Matters. Only they gave me
a sad Relation in my Inn, of a terrible Deso∣lation
caused by a furious Tempest about five
Days before, all along the Sea-Coast from
<HI>Terracinne</HI> to <HI>Naples,</HI> in which 14 Ships had
been dash'd against the Rocks, or Shipwreck'd
on the Sands in several places. I had heard
them speak of it at <HI>Rome</HI> Three days before I
came away from thence, but was not then
inform'd of all the Particulars of it. The
only thing I took notice of in the Account
they gave me, suiting to my present Subject,
was, that amongst the rest there was one
Vessel lost, which had been but lately Blessed,
in order to make it Tempest-proof. They
told me also, That there was a Priest in that
same Vessel, who was put into the Inquisition
for having burnt his Crucifix, after that it had
happily been the Instrument of saving his life.
This Priest had a design of Travelling into
Foreign Countries, and had lighted upon a
very good Invention for to save his Life, in
case of Danger. He had caused to be made for
him a great Cross of Wood, which was hollow
within, but joyn'd very light and close on
all side, like unto those the Penitents carry
upon their Shoulders in the Holy Week; and
differ'd only in this, that it had the Image of
our Saviour fastned to it. This Cross was thus
contriv'd by him, that it might be a proper
means for him, in case he should be Cast-away
at Sea, to escape upon it; and indeed, both
<PB N="109" REF="67"/>
the Shipwreck and his Escape, by means of the
Cross, hapned according to the foresight he
seem'd to have had of it. There arose a
violent Tempest, the first Night the Vessel
put to Sea; so that after having been ex∣treamly
tost and beaten by the Waves, it
sprung a Leak, and let in Water on every
side. All those that were in her, perished,
except only some Sea-men, and our Priest,
who after that he had made use of his great
Crucifix, to exhort those who were ready to
be drowned, to die well, committed himself
to the Sea with it, and by this means was
driven by the Waves to the Shoar; being thus
escaped, he had courage enough to take his
Cross out of the Water along with him; and
soon after met with the Sea-men, that had
sav'd themselves also, who had made a great
Fire on the Shoar to dry themselves, and pass
the rest of the Night, into which the Priest
cast his great Crucifix, and would not suffer
the Company to save it from burning; but the
poor Sea-men, who were not accustomed with
such Sights, were struck with Horror; they
seized the Priest, they manacled him, and
drag'd him the next Morning to the Inquisi∣tion;
and from so black a Crime, as this
Action of his seem'd to be, inferr'd, That he
was a Sorcerer, and had raised the Tempest.
Nevertheless, I was told, That he defended
himself very well; and that in all likelyhood
the Inquisition would release him, because
<PB N="110" REF="68"/>
he pleaded, That what he had done, was in
conformity to the Practice of the Church of
<HI>Rome,</HI> with respect to Holy things, that are in
danger of being profaned, which is to burn
them: In like manner he alledg'd, That not
knowing how to dispose of his great Crucifix,
and being afraid lest it might be profaned,
he had imitated the Custom of the Church in
this Point.</P>
<P>This puts me in mind of many sad Acci∣dents,
which daily happen to the Holy things
of Papists, and especially to that which is the
chiefest Object of their Devotions, <HI>viz.</HI> the
Holy Host, or their Sacrament. I take it for a
thing that is sure and certain, that there are
very few days in a year, when in some part
of the World or other, they are not fain to
burn it, or to put it into a filthy stinking Hole,
to which notwithstanding they give the fair
Title of a <HI>Sacrarium,</HI> or Sanctuary, which is
(as it were) the Dunghil, where they cast forth
that which they believe to be the true Body
of Jesus Christ, that the same may there return
to Corruption. I my self have found, upon
two several Occasions, the Hosts which are
kept in the <HI>Ciboire,</HI> in very bad order: The first
was near <HI>Orvieto,</HI> in a Country Parish, where
the <HI>Ciboire</HI> being not close shut, and the Taber∣nacle
or Cupboard of the <HI>Sacrarium</HI> not being
close joyned, the <HI>Pismires</HI> had made bold to
visit the Holy Sacrament, and finding the
Hosts to their Tooth, had eaten some part of
<PB N="111" REF="68"/>
them, and were dragging the rest in little
pieces to their Ant-hills. I acquainted the
Curate (after I had said Mass) with this dis∣order,
who was much troubled at it; for it
was occasion'd by his Negligence, who had
forgot to shut the <HI>Ciborium.</HI> He entreated me
more earnestly, than he would have done God,
not to speak a word of it to any Body; be∣cause,
if it should come to the Ears of the
Grand Vicar of <HI>Orvietto,</HI> who was already his
Enemy, he would have been undone. We
therefore both of us endeavoured to remedy it
as well as possibly we could; and indeed the
Bishop himself, had he been there, could have
done no more than we did. To prevent all
manner of Scandal, we staid till all the People
were gone out of Church, and traced the
<HI>Pismires</HI> to their Hole, which went under∣ground;
and pursuing it, we found it to lead
to a Cossin, wherein there was a Body that
was half Rotten, which cast forth a most
dreadful stink and infection. Forasmuch
therefore, as it was impossible for us to search
any further, we filled the Hole of the <HI>Ants</HI>
with Straw and Wood, and set fire to it, in
order to consume the Host, the <HI>Ants,</HI> and all
that was in it; and there is no doubt but this
succeeded according to our desire. We met
with many of these little Animals, who being
laden with their Sacrilegious Prey, ran up and
down the Church, which we pick'd up, and
burnt them in a Chasing-Dish, as many as
<PB N="112" REF="69"/>
we could meet with, and after that we had
well Swept the Church, we cast all the Sweep∣ings
into the Fire, and consumed them. This
was indeed as much as could be done. But
alas! there were several other things, which
it was impossible for us to remedy; for seeing
that in all probability the <HI>Ants</HI> had been long
a labouring at the transporting of these Hosts,
the Country People, who all this while came to
Mass, had without doubt crushed many of them
with their Feet, and had carried away with them
pieces of the Host, sticking to the dirt of their
Shoes: Yea, we our selves, who had taken so
great pains to remedy this Mischance, when
we viewed the Soles of our Shoes, found
several Particles sticking to them. Now, ac∣cording
to the Doctrin of the Papists, the Body
of Jesus Christ is whole and entire in the least
Particle, as well as in the greatest, and conse∣quently
we may imagin, how great this Profa∣nation
was.</P>
<P>I have read something of a Book Printed
in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and made by a <HI>Jesuit,</HI> where treat∣ing
of the Eucharist, he takes upon him to
confound the Protestants, by the Examples
he alledgeth of Beasts, who have paid their
Adorations to the Sacrament. Amongst other
things we read there, That <HI>Ants</HI> and <HI>Bees,</HI>
having by chance met with Consecrated Hosts,
which some Hereticks had thrown away in the
Fields, they had with a great deal of Reve∣rence
gathered them up, and carried them to
<PB N="113" REF="69"/>
their Hills and Hives, and having divided
themselves into Quires, they by turns chanted
musically, and sang forth the Praises of God,
until the Priests being drawn that way by their
melodious harmony, came and fetch'd away
their Hosts. What Experiences of this kind
the good Father Jesuit may have had, I know
not; but for the good Curate and my self, I
am sure we met with no Musick.</P>
<P>The second place where I found the Con∣secrated
Hosts much abused, was in a Little
Church near to <HI>Ancona,</HI> in a very moist place.
I found the <HI>Ciborium</HI> full of Wafers; those
that lay uppermost stuck to one another, and
those at the bottom were turn'd into a kind
of Glue or Jelly: And forasmuch as it was
evident, that some of them were wholly spoiled,
and the rest in a fair way to be so too, after
that Mass was ended I cast them all into the
<HI>Sacrarium,</HI> which is a Hole made in the Wall
express for this purpose, and poured upon them
great quantity of Holy-Water, to make them
sink to the bottom, and to cleanse the Orifice
of the <HI>Sacrarium.</HI> This was at that time all
the Ceremony I used to bury that, which I
then believed to be the Body of our Lord.
Others have found the Hosts full of Worms;
and in other places, the Rats have eat them up
whole.</P>
<P><HI>The Divines at</HI> Rome <HI>admit, for the most
part, as many Miracles in these kind of Cor∣ruptions,
as they do in Transubstantiation:</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="70"/>
For after the same manner <HI>(say they)</HI> as at the
Consecration, the Substance of the Bread is tran∣substantiated
into that of the Body, and that the
Accidents of Bread and Wine are supported by the
Divine Power without a Subject; so in the next
moment to Corruption <HI>(say they)</HI> the Body and
Blood of Jesus Christ cease to be in the Host, and
in the Chalice; and that God, by his Omnipotence,
creates in it another Substance, which becomes the
Subject of Corruption.</P>
<P>I have been an Eye-witness of many other
considerable Accidents that have hapned to
their Holy Sacrament. It frequently comes to
pass, that Priests (whilst they are saying Mass)
let some of the Consecrated Wafers fall down
to the ground, and tread upon them without
thinking of it. Others spill the Consecrated
Cup upon the Altar; so that the Precious Blood
of our Lord runs down on all sides, and is
spilt upon the Ground, amongst the Filth and
Spittings of the People. Sometimes Priests
have been taken with a Vomiting, immediately
after Communion. A Priest at <HI>Venice,</HI> as he
was lifting up the <HI>Calice,</HI> for the People to
worship it, spilt it all upon his Head and Sacer∣dotal
Habit, which was all stain'd with it.
These are some of those great Accidents that
happen to the Papists, with respect to their
Sacrament, and which put them to extream
trouble and concern for the remedying of
them. The best way they have, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is to wipe it
up with Tow and Linnen Cloths, which are
<PB N="115" REF="70"/>
afterwards cast into the Fire and burnt, to
wash the Vestments into which it is soaked in
seven several Waters, and to scrape the Stones
and the Wood upon which any of it is fallen;
there be some Priests, who out of Devotion
lick them first of all, clean with their Tongues.
True it is, that, according to the Faith of the
Papists, if it is the true Body and Blood of
our Lord Jesus Christ, they cannot be too
careful in endeavouring to gather up so great
a Treasure; but in good earnest, can any Man
believe, that it is consistent with the Wisdom
of God, to have plac'd the Body and Blood
of his Son, under those accidents that are sub∣ject
to a thousand Casualties and Profanati∣ons,
and this after his having glorified it in
Heaven, and seated it at his right Hand? They
shew us a frightful thing in <HI>Germany,</HI> at a place
called <HI>Maladurne,</HI> which is a Corporal, or a
kind of Tablecloth of Arras, whereupon the
Host and Calice are placed, when Mass is
said, upon which there is Imprinted the Fi∣gure
as it were of the body of a Tree, divi∣ded
into Seven or Nine Branches; at the end
of each Bow, is a Head like to those, they
make of our Saviour Crowned with Thorns,
upon the Napkin or Handkerchif of <HI>Veronica:</HI>
The whole is very ill Drawn, and all the
stroaks and Lineaments of the Heads are very
bungling, neither are all the Heads equally
great, or proportionable to one another. But
for all that, the Tradition is, that the Curate
<PB N="116" REF="71"/>
of that place, as he was one day Celebrating
Mass, spilt the Consecrated Calice, and that
the Blessed Blood of our Saviour falling upon
the Corporal, did Form all these Heads, which
therefore they pretend to be Miraculous. This
is one of the great <HI>Pilgrimages</HI> of the <HI>Germans,</HI>
and you shall scarce meet with any Inhabi∣tants
of the Country towards the Upper-<HI>Rhine,</HI>
who have not the Representation of
this Miracle hanging in their Chambers, at
the bottom of which are these words,
<Q>Christi Sanguis Maladurni in Corporale est.</Q>
But we are not to believe that God works Mi∣racles
without any Reason, or without some
Order, which may discover that such Opera∣tions
proceed from his Hands: But what do
we meet with in this Figure, that bears this
Character? Would God, think we, demonstrate
to us, that the Blood of his Son Jesus Christ is
really present in the Sacrament after the Con∣secration,
by representing an hideous Picture
to us of several Heads, that are extreamly ill
made, and are not like one another? Or
would he by this means intimate to us, that
Jesus Christ is a Monster, with many Heads?
This cannot be affirmed without the greatest
Impiety. For my part, I am well assured,
that no reason can be excogitated, that can
either far or near give us to understand, the
design of this Figure. The Devil also is too
<PB N="117" REF="71"/>
cunning and subtil, to have had any hand in
it; for had it been his doing, he would rather
have made the Figure of some little pretty
Child, such as was that, which they say ap∣peared
in an Host, in the time of S. <HI>Lewis,</HI>
King of <HI>France.</HI> It remains therefore, that
we attribute this Artifice, to the good Curate,
who Celebrated Mass, and who was willing
at once, to draw the Devotion and the Mony
of People to his Church. A <HI>Jew</HI> being come
to vend some Commodities at <HI>Mentz,</HI> in the
House where I was Boarded, having seen one
of these Images hanging in the Stove, demand∣ed
what it was? Whereupon I immediately o∣pened
the Garden Door, and left him, leaving
the Woman of the House to answer him; for
as for my part, I knew not what to say to
him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Germans</HI> have not many Devotions in
their Country, but those which they have are
very gross ones; they dress their Saints of both
Sexes, in such Antick Habits, that one cannot
forbear Laughing in seeing them. In most of
their Churches, they have Crosses of a Prodi∣gious
bigness, and they put upon the Head of
the Figure, that represents our Saviour, great
ugly Periwigs made of the grosser part of
Hair, and great Beards of Hemp.</P>
<P>Forasmuch as I have made mention of the
Figure of <HI>Maladurne,</HI> I have a desire to give
you here a description of some parts of a <HI>Pil∣grimage,</HI>
undertaken to this Image, where I
<PB N="118" REF="72"/>
was present my self upon occasion, four years
ago. I was Travelling from <HI>Mentz</HI> to <HI>Franc∣fort</HI>
about some business; the most commodi∣ous
way to go thither is by Boat, which sets
out from <HI>Mentz</HI> every Morning at seven a
Clock. By ill luck, or rather good luck, (be∣cause
this stop procured me very diverting
Company,) I came too late by half an hour,
and the ordinary Boat was already got out of
sight; but I found another there in the Haven,
which was ready to set Sail, to go up the
<HI>Main</HI> to <HI>Francfort.</HI> This was a great long
Boat or Vessel, which could contain two hun∣dred
Persons, and it was well nigh fill'd with
Persons of both Sexes, who went a <HI>Pilgrima∣ging</HI>
to <HI>Maladurne.</HI> As soon as I was entred
the Boat, they gave me a very good Place,
perceiving me to be a Clergy-man; only I was
obliged to be silent for the space of near two
hours, because I came just at the time of their
Meditation, which lasted an hour, and which
was followed by many Prayers, and <HI>Ora pro no∣bis,</HI>
which lasted another hour. Afterwards
the Father Director of the <HI>Pilgrimage,</HI> who
was a Father <HI>Capucin,</HI> having rung a little Bell,
gave them leave to go to break their Fast, and
silence together. Here it was that all our <HI>Ger∣mans,</HI>
Men and Women, began to rummage
their Bags for Provision; some produced Legs
and Shoulders of Mutton ready Roasted, o∣thers
Gammons of <HI>Mentz,</HI> and Pies, and a
hundred other cold Meats, such as were com∣modious
<PB N="119" REF="72"/>
upon such an occasion, not forgetting
their great Pitchers and Bottels of Wine, and
they strenuously applied themselves to Eating
and Drinking, after such a manner, as was
able to procure an Appetite to the most diffi∣cult
and distasted Spectators. Indeed there
were some amongst them, upon whom it was not
good to cast ones Eyes, because their Viands
were so sluttishly wrapt up, and they thumb'd
and devour'd it in so slovenly and beastly a
manner, that it was enough to turn ones Sto∣mack
to see them. All the Meat that was in
the Boat, was not common to all the Compa∣ny,
but they Eat in Troops or Knots, accor∣ding
as aforehand they had associated them∣selves
together, of what they had brought a∣long
with them, so that some of them fared
much better than others. However they ex∣prest
a great deal of respect to the Father Di∣rector
of the <HI>Pilgrimage,</HI> and his Companion,
by sending them of the best they had upon
their Tables. The Father had the Civility to
invite me to come and Eat with him; but ha∣ving
very well breakfasted at my Lodging,
before I came away, I returned him my
Thanks, without accepting of his kindness.
Nevertheless, they were so importunate with
me on every side, that I was forced to drink
with them; for in <HI>Germany,</HI> they account it
a great Crime for a Man to refuse a Health;
and on such occasions as these, Men are forc'd
to incommodate themselves, how unwilling
<PB N="120" REF="73"/>
soever they may be. Their Breakfast lasted
much longer than their Meditation; however
at last they were fain to make an end of it,
at the Fathers Ringing of his Bell: After
which having impos'd Silence, as well as he
could, he began a kind of Sermon, wherein
he discoursed of the great and many Spiritual
advantages we receive by going on <HI>Pilgri∣mage,</HI>
and more especially by that of <HI>Mala∣durne.</HI>
Above all, he insisted upon the Relati∣on
of a long track of Miracles that had been
wrought in that place, and which were very
Divertizing. Sermon being ended, the
Father <HI>Capucin</HI> put all that were in the Boat
upon making a Confession of their Faith, and
he began with his Companion, asking him a∣loud,
Do you hold in Heart and Mouth, the
Catholick, Apostolick and Roman Faith? The
Brother answered, I do so by the Grace of
God: The Brother put the same question to his
Neighbour, Do you hold with Heart and
Mouth the Faith? <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And he again made
the same Answer, and so the same Question
and Answer run through the whole Boat from
one to the other, not excepting the Boat-men
themselves. They told me that the reason of
their taking this Precaution was, to find whe∣ther
there were any Hereticks in the Boat, and
if they had found any, they would have forc'd
them to leave the Boat, because they were apt
to mock at their Sacred Mysteries and Holy
Practices of <HI>Pilgrimaging.</HI> This Confession
<PB N="121" REF="73"/>
being ended, and all the Company having
been found good Catholicks, the Father re∣ceived
the Vows of a Troop of <HI>Pilgrims,</HI>
which were come from <HI>Hockum</HI> that Morning,
and joyn'd themselves to the rest of the Com∣pany
in the Boat. He made them all to kneel
before him, and made them say after him with
a lowd and audible Voice these words, <HI>I</HI> N.
<HI>do vow to go to the holy Relick of</HI> Maladurne, <HI>and
during the whole Journy, as well going as coming,
to be Obedient to the Reverend Father</HI> Blasius, <HI>Di∣rector
of the Pilgrimage.</HI> This done, the Fa∣ther
<HI>Blasius,</HI> (for that was the <HI>Capucin's</HI> Name,)
gave them his Benediction, and embraced
them one after another, and afterwards sent
them to embrace the rest of their Compani∣ons.
I took notice that the Father exprest a
great deal of Civility to these last come <HI>Pil∣grims,</HI>
and plac'd them near to himself, on his
Right Hand. Now it is t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be noted, that
<HI>Hockum,</HI> whence these Men came, is the place
where the very best Rhenish Wine grows,
and whereof they had brought along with
them, a very plentiful Provision. These there∣fore
with a great deal of reason were placed
at the Right, and the <HI>Pilgrims</HI> of <HI>Bacrack,</HI> who
had possest that Place till then, were fain to
pass over to the Left. The Father having
Commanded the whole Company to kneel
down, pull'd out of his Sleeve a little Image
or Figure of the Miracle of <HI>Maladurne,</HI> and
having himself first Kissed all the Heads repre∣sented
<PB N="122" REF="74"/>
on it, he delivered it over from Hand
to Hand, that every one might do the same;
which done, he enjoyned the saying of seven
<HI>Paternosters,</HI> in Honour to every one of the
Heads. Whilst all these Ceremonies, Prayers
and Adorations were performing, the Boat
Arrived at <HI>Hochst,</HI> which is a small City, be∣longing
to the Elector of <HI>Mentz,</HI> and where
they make an Hours halt to Eat their Dinners.
There be very good Inns in this Place, and
many stept out of the Boat, either to Dine
there, or to buy more Provisions; but the great∣est
part, remain'd in the Boat and Din'd
there. The Father <HI>Capucin</HI> was so very im∣portunate
with me, that he oblig'd me to stay
with him. These kind of Boats are so large
and long, that always at one end of them,
they have a very large Kitchin, where they
Boil and Roste whatsoever the Company de∣sires.
The Kitchin hapned to be very well
furnisht that day, and after that the <HI>Capucin</HI>
had craved a Blessing, we sat down to Din∣ner.
The heat and fumes of the Meat and
Pottage, had so extreamly heated the Boat,
that one could scarcely fetch ones Breath in
it, and caused a very unpleasant scent, for these
Boats are all covered with Boards, like Houses,
and they can let in no Air to them, but only
by the sides, and by a Board on the top of the
Boat, which they can lift up, upon occasion.
I repented that I had been persuaded to stay
and Dine there, and that I had not stept out
<PB N="123" REF="74"/>
to take a little fresh Air, as others did. But
yet to countervail this Displeasure, I took de∣light
to see the <HI>Germans</HI> Eat at the rate they
did; for notwithstanding the good Breakfast
they had made, they Eat with that Greedi∣ness,
as if they had seen no Meat in three days.
God be praised, said the <HI>Capucin,</HI> I see that
Devotion procures a good Stomack. He was
a Man of a very good humour, and who had
always a Jest at command to divert the Com∣pany
with; but nevertheless he did one thing
which did much displease me, and was very
unbecoming the Gravity, which ought always
to be inseparable from a long Beard, and es∣pecially
from one that is a Conductor and
Director of <HI>Pilgrims.</HI> Dinner being ended,
and the <HI>Capucin</HI> having given Thanks, he grant∣ed
one hour of Recreation to the Company.
This Recreation consists in speaking and act∣ing
all sort of Fooleries, and above all in
drinking Healths, and eating relishing Bits,
and Incentives to Drink, as Gammons of Ba∣con,
dried Tongues, and other Salt-Meats.
The Father had for his part, a good Gammon
of <HI>Mentz</HI> before him; and having plac'd on
his right hand a great Bottle of Wine, which
the <HI>Pilgrims</HI> of <HI>Hockum</HI> had bestowed upon
him, and another great Bottle of <HI>Bacrack</HI>
Wine on his left hand, he plac'd them both
on each side of his Gammon of Bacon, and
Laughing said, with a loud Voice, so that all
the Company might hear him, these Latin
<PB N="124" REF="75"/>
words taken out of the XXth Chapter of
S. <HI>Matthew,</HI> most filthily profaning them:
<HI>Grant, that these two Bottles may sit the one on
the Right hand, and the other on the Left.</HI></P>
<P>After this he got into the best Humor of the
World, and drunk to admiration. I desired
him to tell me, why they were so cautelous
to prevent, that no Hereticks might lurk in the
Boats amongst them: The Reason is, (said he)
because they mock us; yea, some of them are
not afraid to abuse us very insolently. Once
upon a time (proceeded he) five or six of
these wicked Men play'd us a very ill Trick;
they had mix'd themselves amongst the Pil∣grims,
to observe what we did. We disco∣ver'd
them at last, when after having worship'd
the Holy Image, I sent it about for them to
kiss. One of them took it in his hand, and
instead of kissing it, he with horrible Blasphe∣mies
threw it into the Water, saying, That
<HI>that Image was more like the</HI> Hydra <HI>of</HI> Hercules,
<HI>or the Beast in the</HI> Revelations, <HI>than like Jesus
Christ.</HI> Our Pilgrims seeing this horrible Im∣piety,
ran to him with design to have pull'd
him to pieces; but four or five other wicked
Wretches, his Companions, drew their Swords
in his defence, and to make way for him to
escape; and the only way was left him, was
to leap over-board, which he did, and by
Swimming got to the other side of the River.
The Rage our Pilgrims were in, to see this
Wretch was got out of their hands, made
<PB N="125" REF="75"/>
them fall upon the rest, and one of them had
his Arm run through. I had much ado to
appease the Tumult; but at last I made them
call to mind the Obedience they had vow'd
to me; and they let the Hereticks go ashoar,
after that they had soundly beaten them. By
ill-luck for our Pilgrims, all this had hapned in
the Jurisdiction of <HI>Francfort,</HI> whither we were
going, and where they are all Hereticks; and
these wicked Rogues had made haste and got
there before us, and had made their Com∣plaints
to the Magistrates; who sent immedi∣ately
to stop or arrest our Boat, and they
carried us all Prisoners to a great Tower,
where we were kept till the next day. We
expected all of us no less than to be made
Martyrs; but instead thereo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Magistrates
having taken more particular Information of
the Matter, the next Morning sent to us in a
manner to excuse themselves, and to tell us,
That they wholly disapproved the Action of
those rash and giddy Youths; and if we had
made our Complaints of them, without abusing
them, they would have done us Justice: But
however, forasmuch as there had been some
Blood spilt, we were condemned to pay the
Charges of the Justice, and an hundred Gil∣ders,
to be distributed amongst those Prote∣stants
that had been abus'd by them. The
Mony was soon found amongst our Pilgrims,
for all did not amount to Half a Crown apiece.
The Receiver to whom we paid our Mony
<PB N="126" REF="76"/>
told us, in a very girding manner, that the
only cause of all these Quarrels was, because
in our Pilgrimages we swallow'd down more
Rhenish Wine, than Holy-Water. When
we were returned to our Boat, we found
almost all the Provisions of Victuals that we
had left; only they had taken care to visit our
Bottles and empty them, and fill'd them with
Water. After that again we had Embark'd
our selves, I call'd to mind the Holy Image of
<HI>Malaturne,</HI> which the Heretick had cast into
the Water, and which we had quite forgot,
by reason of this Hurly-burly we were en∣gag'd
in. I was inspired of God, to send some
of our Company in a little Boat to seek for it;
and they found it miraculously on the Shoar,
amongst the Sedge. It is the very same I have
still at this day, and which all of you have
worship'd this Morning. It was an Image of
Paper, fastned with Starch to a Piece of Wood;
neither was it any great Miracle, that being
such it did not sink, or that it was stopt amongst
the Sedge. But however, the good Father took
it as a great honour to him. He told us this
Story with a great deal of Pleasantness, and
Laughing said, <HI>We shall in the Evening see those
Devils, that emptied our Bottles;</HI> he said not, <HI>Who
have profan'd our Image.</HI></P>
<P>Whilst the Father was telling this Story,
they drunk Healths to him from all Quarters;
and he very frankly Pledged them all out of
his two Bottles. When the Hour-Glass, which
<PB N="127" REF="76"/>
was turn'd up for the Hour of Recreation
was run out, they inform'd the Father of it;
and he having rang his Bell, all the Company
shut up their Glasses and Bottles, and he took a
Book in his hand, to read a Spiritual Lecture,
which was to last one Hour; which was to be
followed with a Meditation of the same con∣tinuance,
as in the Morning: After which, he
was to Preach an Hour, and then they were
to betake themselves to their Afternoons Treat,
or Collation. The Father accordingly began
his Reading with a great deal of Vigor; but
he was not gon far, before that the Fumes
of the Wine having got into his Head, he
knew no more what he read, so that his Com∣panion
was fain to take the Book from him;
neither did he proceed much further in his
Reading: For finding that the Father Dire∣ctor,
and most of the Pilgrims, were Nodding
and Snoring on every side of him, he very
fairly laid down his Book on the Table, and
leaning his Head upon it, fell asleep for Com∣pany.
Never in my life did I see such an
Image of Devotion, as was then to be seen in
this Boat. Those who could neither Sleep, nor
take Tobacco, set themselves to Chat together,
and to tell Jests and Merry Tales, to make
Laughter. They could not Play at Cards,
because all manner of Gaming had been forbid
them. I for my part, being no Pilgrim,
got upon the Deck of the Boat, to take a
little Air; where I found a Gentleman of
<PB N="128" REF="77"/>
<HI>Mentz,</HI> whom I was acquainted with, and
with whom I discoursed a good while con∣cerning
this Pilgrimage. I told him, that I
was extreamly scandaliz'd to see so much
Brutality acted amongst Christians, and that
even in the midst of those Exercises, in which
they pretend most to Devotion. He told me, that
I had seen nothing as yet; that they had yet a
Day and an half to be on the Water, and to
lead the same manner of life as I had seen;
and that afterwards they were to Land at a
certain place, from whence they had almost
two days Journy through Woods to <HI>Mala∣durne,</HI>
which all of them went on Foot; That
this was the most pleasant and merry part of
all the Journy, for that they were us'd to go
and sing amongst the Rocks, where there were
most Ravishing Eccho's; afterwards, they
would go further, to find some pleasant place
or other, where all the Company might sit
down upon the Grass, whilst the Father was
Preaching to them.</P>
<P>After Sermon they continued their Journy
a little further, till they came to some de∣lightful
place, amongst shady Trees, where
they refresh'd themselves with Eating and
Drinking. The Father Director made those
that were the most able and strong amongst
them, to carry the Provisions, besides what
every one carried of their own. Here they
did eat all of them in Common, and an
equal and abundant distribution was made to
<PB N="129" REF="77"/>
every one, both of Meat and Drink. The
greatest trouble and inconvenience they have,
(said he) is to carry those, who after their
Meals are found Drunk; for these the Men
were obliged to carry by Turns on their
Shoulders, or to lead them under the Arms,
until they had a little digested their Wine.
If at any time it hapned, that the number of
those that were Drunk, was too great for the
rest to lead or carry them, then all the Com∣pany
was oblig'd to make a Halt, till they were
come to themselves again; for they are all
bound by Oath, not to leave any one of their
Company behind them, for fear of any Acci∣dent
that might happen to them. The Father
<HI>Capucin</HI> shewed himself always very favourable
to this sort of People, because frequently he
had been one of the number, and had been
in his Turn carried upon their Shoulders.
When the Pilgrims were arrived at <HI>Maladurne,</HI>
the Father Confessed them, and Absolved them
of all the Faults and Excesses they had com∣mitted
during their Journy, and gave them
the Communion with his own hands; after∣wards
they went to Visit the Holy Relick; and
having staid there the remainder of the Day,
he led them back again by the same way
that they came, to the Boat, making them
repeat the same Exercises they used in go∣ing.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="78"/>
I desired this Gentleman to tell me, after
what manner these Pilgrims pass'd the Nights.
I knew already, that as long as they went by
Water, they laid down in the Boat, and slept in
their Cloaths, every one in his place, in leaning
their Heads one upon another. And this in∣deed
was in a manner the only thing that I
found to be very troublesom in all their Pil∣grimage.
But I was very desirous to know,
how they Lodg'd when they Travell'd by
Land, and whether they could meet with Beds
enough for all their Company, considering
their great Numbers? The Gentleman, at
this Question of mine, fell a Laughing, and
told me, That he found that I was not over
well acquainted with the Custom of <HI>Germany;</HI>
and that there were no Beds to be found,
except only in great Cities, and along the
Upper <HI>Rhine,</HI> where I had Travelled: But,
that in all other Parts, there were none to be
found; and that Travellers thought themselves
very happy, when they could meet with fresh
Straw to lye upon. The way therefore of our
Pilgrims Lodging was after this manner: They
got into Barns, or the Peasants Houses, where
they procur'd for their Mony some Bundles of
Straw, which they spread upon the Floor, and
stretch'd themselves along upon it, like Herrings,
Men and Women pel-mel together, of what
condition soever they may be, without having
any thing wherewith to cover themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="78"/>
True it is, that I had already had some
experience hereof; for having once passed up
the <HI>Rhine</HI> from <HI>Collen</HI> to <HI>Mentz,</HI> with a Count
of the Empire, who had with him the
Countess his Wife, and two Sons; we were
fain to lye two Nights upon Straw, in
two pitiful Villages, without being able so
much as to procure a Bed for the Countess.
The Rats and Mice skipt over our Faces all
Night, and we had nothing to cover our selves
with, save only our Cloaks. However, I did
not conceive this to be so common in <HI>Ger∣many,</HI>
as this Gentleman inform'd me. We
were yet engaged in our Discourse about our
Pilgrims, when we heard the noise of our
<HI>Capucins</HI> Bell; this made me go down into the
Boat, to see what they were going about next.
I found the <HI>Capucin</HI> a rubbing of his Eyes, and
demanding what of the Clock it was, and
how far we were got. They told him, that
he had Slept three Hours, and that they were
come near to <HI>Francfort.</HI> He testified his Trou∣ble,
that he had not been in a condition to put
them upon their Holy Exercises; but <HI>the Spirit
is ready,</HI> (said he) <HI>and the Flesh weak.</HI> Well,
there was now no remedy; and forasmuch as
he perceiv'd that the Collation Hour was
come, he enjoyn'd all the Company to fetch
out their Bottles. The Pilgrims therefore fell
again as heartily to their Eating and Drinking,
as if they had neither Eaten nor Drunk all the
Journy. Indeed the thing I admir'd most,
<PB N="132" REF="79"/>
was to see, how they could Eat and Drink at
the rate as they did; and yet this was not all,
for two Hours after they were to go to
Supper.</P>
<P>They had scarcely begun their Collation,
when the Boat arrived at <HI>Francfort.</HI> I stept
out of the Boat in the Haven, after having
taken my leave of the Father, and all his Holy
Company, who were to stay there an Hour,
to take in some fresh Provisions. If I had
not had some business at <HI>Francfort,</HI> which I
could not put off, I believe I should have
been induc'd to Accompany these Pilgrims
to <HI>Maladurne,</HI> and by this means should have
been in a condition, to have given you an
entire description of this Pilgrimage, and of
the pleasant Adventures, which seldom fail of
being coincident with them; but for want of
a favourable opportunity, I can give you no
more but this small shred of it. I shall only
tell you, That this was the good Fathers Trade
all the Summer long. When the Pilgrims
had performed their Vows, he brought them
back again to the place where he had taken
them up, after having first given them a great
Benediction, and some Indulgences, which he
said he had received of the Pope; and thus
having dispatched them, he provided himself
again with others.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="79"/>
See here the good Fruit which the Miracle
of the spilling of the Blood of Jesus Christ
has produc'd, which was wrought to confound
the Protestants, and to replenish the Children
of the Church with Heavenly Graces. I shall
not need trouble my self in Moralizing this
Subject any further, as being that which car∣ries
its Moral along with it. I only beg Par∣don
of the Protestants, for the Shame I have
caus'd them in relating such a Story; and the
Fault I have committed herein was the greater,
because it had no great reference to my <HI>Nea∣politan</HI>
Journy; neither indeed had I inserted it,
but because this Second Days Journy from
<HI>Veletre</HI> to <HI>Terracine</HI> prov'd very dry and barren,
and did not furnish me with sufficient Matter
to entertain my Reader. However, I cannot
but think, that such like Matters of Fact may
in some sort deserve to be made Publick, and
I don't believe I shall have occasion, to write
of them any more. And so I return to my
Journy.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS
ON A
JOURNY
TO
NAPLES.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The Third Days Journy.</HEAD>
<P>UPon the Way from <HI>Terracinne</HI> to <HI>Fondi,</HI>
a most sad Spectacle presented it self
to our Eyes: We saw about a Score
of <HI>Sbirries,</HI> who surrounding the House of a
Peasant, had block'd up all the Avenues there∣of,
and whose Countenances shewed, that
they had met with a Prize. Having enquired
<PB N="135" REF="80"/>
what the matter was, they told us, That they
had seized a Nun, who had made her Escape
from a Convent, with the help of a young
Man, who had stollen her away. The desire
we had of seeing her, made us stay there above
an Hour. At last, they brought her forth out of
the House, with Irons on her Hands and Feet.
They set her upon a Horse, to which they
bound her fast with a great Chain, which
they had put round her Waste. She did not
seem to be above Eighteen years of Age, and
was tolerably handsom. She made dreadful
Outcries and Lamentations, and the Despair
that had seiz'd her was so great, that she beg'd
of all the Passengers, they would be so kind as
to kill her. She made several Attempts, to
throw her self down from her Horse, but all
in vain; for they had bound her so fast, that
it was impossible for her. We were not above
Five Miles from <HI>Fondi,</HI> whither they were
carrying her, and we followed her all the
Way, at less than half a quarter of a Miles
distance. The Throng of People, that came
running in from all Parts to see her, was so
great, that we had much ado to enter the
Town, for fearing lest some Insurrection
might be caus'd by so Tumultuous an Assembly.
As soon as she was entred, they shut the Gates,
and we were forc'd to stay without near five
Hours; after which, with a great deal ado,
we at last made a shift to get in. Every one
spoke so differently of the Matter, that it was
<PB N="136" REF="81"/>
very difficult for us to learn the precise Truth;
but the greatest certainty we could gather
from their Relations were, That it was only a
simple Escape of a Nun, who did not like her
being coup'd up in a Convent. She was of
the Order of S. <HI>Francis;</HI> but they told us, That
about a Month ago, three Nuns of the Order
of S. <HI>Bernard,</HI> had made their Escape with bet∣ter
success; for having taken their Way to∣wards
the Sea-Coast, they met with a <HI>Turkish</HI>
Vessel, that took them in. The Relation of
so strange an Adventure touch'd me to the
Heart, and fill'd me with a just Indignation
against the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> for having ere∣cted
such States of endless Restraints, and so
contrary to Natural Liberty, that those who
have been so unhappy as to be engag'd in them,
are afterwards desirous to quit themselves
thereof, at the cost of embracing a perpetual
Slavery amongst a most Barbarous People, and
the greatest Enemies of Christendom.</P>
<P>I had conceiv'd a design in the LETTERS
I have Published, to Treat of the Nuns of
<HI>Italy;</HI> but some Reasons having oblig'd me,
to Publish them sooner than I intended, I
had not the leisure to reduce that Matter in
order, which yet is of importance enough,
not to be pass'd over in Silence. Wherefore
I shall speak of them here, by occasion of this
Nun of <HI>Fondi,</HI> and shall make it the Enter∣tainment
of this Third Days Journy.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="81"/>
I do not pretend here to discourse of the
Institution of Nuns in the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI>
It is known, that notwithstanding the same
may be thought ancient enough, yet is indeed
but novel, and took its rise at a time,
when many other Weeds of <HI>Superstition</HI> began
to over-grow the Church. I shall only make
it my business, to represent the State of the
Nuns as it is at present. The Motives which
engage them to this kind of Life, their Occu∣pations
or Employments in the Convents, and
their Intriegues abroad, together with the Scan∣dals,
which this forc'd kind of Life doth from
time to time produce.</P>
<P>We may assert in General, That all the
Monasteries of the Females in <HI>Italy,</HI> are very
well Founded, that is, Endowed, except some
few, where the Nuns profess the Poverty of
S. <HI>Francis;</HI> as those are, who are called the
Poor <HI>Clarisses,</HI> and some others. Besides these
great Foundations, they have also a Casual
Revenue, which amounts to no less than their
yearly Incoms: For all of them take in Pen∣sioners,
and there is never a Religious House,
that hath not at the least Threescore or Four∣score
of them, who all pay great Pensions.
The <HI>Italians</HI> put out their Daughters to Board
in Convents, in like manner as we put them
here to Boarding-Schools, to learn all sorts of
Work becoming Gentlewomen. There are in
every Convent some Nuns deputed to take the
care of these Boarders, and Teach them.
<PB N="138" REF="82"/>
All their Works belong to the <HI>Nuns,</HI> who Sell
them, driving a considerable Trade by this
means to their great Profit. The <HI>Italians</HI> send
their Young Daughters at the Age of five or
six Years into the Monasteries, and of this
great Number, some are to return again to
their Parents, after a certain time, and the
rest make themselves, or are forced to become
<HI>Nuns;</HI> so that these Schools are the fruitful
Nurseries, whence the Monasteries are People∣ed
and receive their Complement, and with∣out
which they would soon become Deserts,
there being few <HI>Italian</HI> Families, who have
seen a little of the World, and are come to
the Age of Discretion and Knowledge, that
are willing freely to Imprison themselves there,
notwithstanding they be kept in a kind of con∣tinual
Slavery in their own Houses.</P>
<P>The Parents of these little Boarders, know
so well how to command the Spirits of the
<HI>Nuns</HI> that Govern them, that by this means
they do what they please; and to discover the
Secret in one word, it is by Presents. If they
have a desire that their Daughter should be a
<HI>Nun,</HI> these Governants and Mistresses forget
nothing of what they think may incline them
to it. They will talk to them a thousand times
a day, of the advantages of a Religious Life,
which may be reduced according to them, to
the following Heads:</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="82"/>
In the First place, they will tell them, that
a <HI>Nuns</HI> Habit, becomes them extreamly well,
and that the Vail makes them look as hand∣some
again, as the common secular Dress.</P>
<P>Secondly, That they shall be always sure
to Eat and Drink of the best, and that they
shall never want any thing conducive to a
pleasant recreative Life.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That they shall live in great Ho∣nour,
and that after two or three years, they
shall have the respect of being called Mo∣thers.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That they shall always have the
freedom to see and speak with their Kinsfolks
and Friends at the Grate; yea, to Treat them
with good Dinners, and splendid Collations
in the Parlour, with the Mony that shall be
allowed them for their Boarding.</P>
<P>Fifthly, That afterwards they shall be dig∣nified
and raised to Religious Charges and
Employments, one of them shall be Mistress
of the Novices, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ther the Governess of the
Boarders, others again Sacristans, Overseers
of the Provisions, Prioresses; yea, that all of
them in their Turns, may become Lady Ab∣besses.</P>
<P>And in the Sixth and Last place, They do
not fail to add to all the rest, that they shall
be sure of Eternal Life. To this purpose a
<HI>Nun</HI> of <HI>Vicenza</HI> told me very pleasantly, that
they Preached only six Beatitudes to them,
and that they always wanted two to make
<PB N="140" REF="83"/>
them perfectly happy, <HI>viz.</HI> Liberty and a
Husband.</P>
<P>Besides these, there be many other lesser
Reasons, which may engage Young Girls to
make themselves <HI>Nuns.</HI> Some enter upon this
kind of Life, because they have some of their
Kindred that are <HI>Nuns;</HI> they have an Aunt
or a Cousin in the Monastery, or some She
Friend of theirs. Others engage themselves
in this Profession, because they know that they
cannot make so fair a Figure in the World,
as they fain would; others again, because
they find the Monastery, the Gardens, and
Chamber allotted them, to their liking; and
some also, because they are at liberty to Jest
and play the Fool, as much as they please. In
a word, a hundred other Motives of this Na∣ture,
do not fail to give the first start to the
Vocation of these Girls. But the most un∣happy
of them all, and those whom I truly
pity, are those, who not suffering themselves
to be cajoll'd by these petty Amusements,
have their Thoughts fixed upon the loss of their
Liberty, upon the great Temptations they ex∣pose
themselves to, and who, besides all this,
have a natural Antipathy against all these kind
of Maxims, and who openly protest, they
can never resolve to embrace a Monastick
Life; and yet for all this, will they nill they,
must do it; their Parents, from a Family-Inte∣rest,
will have it so; these Cruel and Unnatu∣ral
Monsters press them to it; and if this proves
<PB N="141" REF="83"/>
Ineffectual, they proceed to Outrageousness
and Blows; yea, even to threats of killing
them with their own Hands, if they do not
pronounce the impious and Sacrilegious Vows;
for so I call those Vows which are made a∣gainst
ones Will, and where the Will doth nei∣ther
accord with the outward act, nor with
the Tongue that utters them.</P>
<P>I had almost forgot to relate to you the Ce∣remony
that is performed some days before
these Young Virgins take upon them the Re∣ligious
Habit. They allow them a Week to
go and take their leaves of their Kindred and
Friends, and they Attire them in the Richest
Clothes that can be had, and which are com∣monly
Embroidered with Pearls and Precious
Stones, that have been borrowed up and down:
They put a rich Crown upon their Heads,
and a Scepter in their Hands, as it were to sig∣nifie
thereby, that they are entring upon a
State of Life preferable to that of Queens, and
in this Pomp they are led in a Coach through
the City, and carried to all their Kindred,
where they never fail of being Sumptuously
Entertained. There are no Young Women,
who seeing them pass by, with all this Pomp
and Magnificence, do not wish themselves to
be in the same Condition. But the Mischief
of it is, the Festival doth not last always, and
the day of their putting on the Habit comes,
in which these Young Ladies are carried in
Triumph to the Convent; as so many Victims
<PB N="142" REF="84"/>
they are going to offer up to the Avarice of
their Parents, to the Interests of their Family,
or to some other Predominant Passion; for as
for the Glory of God, that is not a thing that
comes in competition in <HI>Italy,</HI> on these sort of
Occasions. The most part of <HI>Nuns</HI> will tell
you, two or three years after their Profession,
that they have been impos'd upon, or that
they have deceived themselves, and that the
Motives which have enclin'd them to embrace
this kind of Life, were some little foolish Con∣ceits
or Trifles, the desire whereof has quite
left them. But poor unhappy they, there is
no Remedy left for them.</P>
<P>The Ceremonies of their taking the Habit
are very Magnificent, and no less Ridiculous.
The Abbess of the Convent will needs appear
at this Solemnity, in her Pontifical Habit,
and Acts the Farce of <HI>Pope-Joan,</HI> with her
Crosier-Staff in her Hand, and her Miter up∣on
her Head: The signings with the Cross,
and the aspersions of Holy-water are never
wanting in abundance. But after a great
many Preliminaries, they come to the point
in Hand, which is to uncase these Maidens of
their Secular Habits, and to put upon them
those of the Religion. And all this while they
have gayety enough in their Looks; but when
they come to cut off their Hair, then it is
that the most of them can hold no longer,
but burst forth into Tears; which probably
proceeds from some remainder of Love, they
<PB N="143" REF="84"/>
still have for that, which they have taken so
much pains to Cultivate and Adorn, and that
which makes the fairest Ornament of the <HI>Ita∣lian</HI>
Ladies, who cannot endure any thing up∣on
their Heads, but their own Hair, which
they frizle, curle and bind up in different
manners, enterlacing them with Flowers ei∣ther
Artificial or Natural. It may be also,
because at that time, they have a more Lively
Sense of the loss of their Liberty, they are
then entring upon. For tho' they are allow'd
one or two years of Novitiate, before they
make Profession, or engage themselves by a
Solemn Vow, yet they never afterwards re∣fuse
to do it. The <HI>Italians</HI> have reduc'd a
<HI>Nuns</HI> leaving her Monastery, to that pitch of
Dishonour and Infamy, that a Maid who had
been Whipt by the publick Executioner, in
the most publick places of the City, or who
had been Stigmatized and stood under the
Gallows, might appear with less shame in
Company, than a Religious, who should leave
the Monastery after she has taken the Habit.
So that after once they have made the first
step, they are in a fair way, or rather in ab∣solute
necessity of making the other also.</P>
<P>And forasmuch as the business here lies ra∣ther
in quitting the World, than the Spirit of
it; the <HI>Nuns</HI> are very cautelous, not to re∣ceive
any <HI>Nun</HI> amongst them, without being
assured of a Pension for them from their Pa∣rents,
of at least 100 Crowns a year, which
<PB N="144" REF="85"/>
serves purely and simply to buy her things she
has a mind to, and which may give her some
satisfaction and palliate her Restraint. I knew
a <HI>Nun</HI> of the Monastery of S. <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bap∣tist</HI>
in <HI>Bononia,</HI> whom her Parents allowed a
Pistol every day; with this Mony they buy
the Materials they stand in need of for their
Works, which afterwards they present to
some of their Friends, or else Sell them for
Mony. They are also obliged with the said
Mony to perform the Offices of their Religi∣ous
Order, by turns, at their own Charges.
She who is the Sacristan, must during her
year of Officiating, provide the Wine that
is used at Masses, and the Wax that is Burnt
upon the Altar. The Overseer of the Mouth
Provisions must Treat the <HI>Nuns</HI> at her own
Charges, at the Principal Festivals of the year,
with all manner of Curiosities and Dainties.
They are oblig'd also every one in their turn,
to furnish a Mass for their Preacher, and their
Confessor; and herein it is, they endeavour
to outvie one another, which is the reason
why these Fathers lead such Delicious Lives,
and are so indulgent in Pardoning of their
Sins, to whom they are beholding for so many
good Bits. Besides all this, they have the li∣berty
of Treating their Relations and Friends,
who come to Visit them at the Grates, and of
giving them Collations in the outward Parlour.
In a word, I am sure, that if their Pensions
were Ten times more than they are, they
<PB N="145" REF="85"/>
would not be to seek for Means to spend them.
This necessity of having so much Mony, at
one dash, excludes all poor Maidens, and
those of midling Condition from all Religi∣ous
Houses, and their Parents find it more for
their Interest to Marry them, except they
have a mind to make Convert Sisters of them,
(that is, Servants to the other Nuns,) or poor
<HI>Clarisses.</HI></P>
<P>The Convents of Nuns are no otherwise
lookt upon at present, than as a convenient
means of discharging Families of supernume∣rary
Encumbrances. The <HI>Italians</HI> commonly
Marry no more than one or two of their
Children, and so all the rest are forced to
become Priests or Monks, if they be Boys, or
Nuns, if they be Girls. However it must
cost them a Pension, for without it, they will
never be received. The Call of God to any
of these States, is no longer owned, except
they bring along with them a good Purse to
attest it. Is it not a thing to be Lamented,
to see the Papists have the impudence to re∣proach
the Protestants, that they have Sacrile∣giously
abolished these Sacred Retreats, where
the Virgins have their Liberty, <HI>to follow the
Lamb whithersoever he goes?</HI> Is it not evident
as the Sun at Noon-day, that before they will
open their Gates to them, the Enquiry is not
whether they have <HI>Oil in their Lamps,</HI> but
whether they have <HI>Mony in their Purses?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="86"/>
Let us now take a view, how those who
have the happiness to be Admitted, do employ
their time there. I confess, I speak somewhat
improperly, for no Body is permitted to go and
take a view of them; but however, we may
make a guess of it by the Works that come from
them; the most Curious Laces and Points, the
most rich and sumptuous Embroideries, and the
most exquisit Handy-works, Artificial Flowers,
Pretty Knacks and Curiosities, with a thousand
other Toys, are the most serious Occupations
of these Holy Recluses; so that indeed, tho'
they be retir'd from the World themselves,
they are wholly busied to glut and satisfie the
Vanity of it in others. But the Master-piece
wherein they excel, is their Skill in preparing
all Dainties and Enticements of the Palat, to
preserve Fruits, to make Sweet-Meats, dry and
liquid, all sorts of Pastry-Works, and White-Meats;
all which shews them to have very
dainty and licorish Palats. All this is com∣priz'd
in <HI>Italian</HI> under the Words of <HI>Roba Dolce,</HI>
or <HI>Roba di Monache: If any would have
them to make a Piece of Pastry, or to Dress any
other dainty Dish, they must send them as much
more of the Ingredients, as can enter the Compo∣sition;
for it is known, they will be sure to take the
one half for themselves; and besides, they must pay
Dearer for the Fashion, than it would cost them at
the Cooks: But withal it must be confest, that they
get for their Mony something that is far more
neatly done, and delicious, than if the Cooks had had
the handling of it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="86"/>
If they seem Covetous on one hand, on
other Occasions again you'l find them as Libe∣ral
and Profuse; yea, one may say of them,
That they do not addict themselves to Avarice,
but that they may be in a better condition to
exercise their Liberality. When any Festivals are
celebrated in their Churches, all the Priests
and Monks that Officiate in Saying Mass, are
sure to be dismist with their Handkerchiefs fill'd
with Biskets and dried Sweet-Meats; and they
who perform the Evening-Service, are afterwards
conducted to the Parlour, where they have
a Collation presented them, of all manner of
exquisit Dainties and excellent Wines. I once
hapned at <HI>Milan</HI> to be present at one of these
Collations of the Nuns of the Monastery <HI>Ma∣giore.</HI>
All the Crust of their Pastry-Work
were made of Almonds, Pine-kernels, and
Pistaches, which had been beaten or ground
into Flower. An Old Priest seeing this Excess,
could not hinder himself from saying, <HI>O, Dio,
Come potiamo mangiar questo senza Peccato!
Good, GOD, Is't possible to eat this without Sin!</HI>
But a young Nun answered him, <HI>Si, si Signor,
è cosa buena per i vecchi: Ay, ay Sir, It is a good
thing for Old Men.</HI> They are more ready at
their Jests and Drollery, than those who are
most Conversant in the World. Yea, what is
more, there reigns in their Cloisters a Spirit
of <HI>Impudence, Effrontery,</HI> and <HI>Impiety,</HI> beyond
what is found elsewhere; which proceeds, as
I believe, from the secret Rage they have
<PB N="148" REF="87"/>
conceiv'd, for having lost their Liberty. They
abandon themselves, as far as they are able,
to all manner of Luxury; and were it not that
Modesty well becomes a Writer in this kind
of Matters, I could relate Facts to you that
would make your Hairs stand on end. In
order to remove all occasions of such Enor∣mities,
the <HI>Italian</HI> Bishops have taken care to
double their Grates, which were only single
before, as they are still to this day in <HI>France</HI>
and <HI>Germany.</HI> The first Grate is about a Foot
distant from the second Grate; and the Bars
are so close set together, that one cannot
thrust in his Fist. Moreover, they have most
expresly forbid all manner of Persons, as well
Ecclesiastical, as Civil, (except it be Kindred
to the Second Degree) to go to see them, or
speak with them, without an express Permis∣sion
set down in Writing, and Signed with
their own Hands, or of the Vicar General,
deputed over the Monasteries, upon pain of
being Prosecuted in the Ecclesiastical Court,
and condemn'd either to Prison, or to pay
great Fines.</P>
<P>In a word, it may be truly said, That they
have taken more Precautions, to hinder all
Men from Visiting them, than if they were
struck with the Plague. But yet all these rigo∣rous
Prohibitions, do not hinder their Parlours
from being always well fill'd with Company;
and the <HI>Sbirries,</HI> who have Orders to make a
search in the Parlours, and at the Grates of
<PB N="149" REF="87"/>
Convents, dare not so much as come near
them; for all these Nuns commonly have very
powerful Relations and Friends, who would
take care to get their Legs and Arms broke
for them, should they ever offer to attempt
the least thing that might displease them. To
speak the Truth, these Prohibitions serve only
to enflame the <HI>Italians</HI> the more, to go and
Visit them, if it were for no other thing, but
because it is a thing forbid. <HI>Omnis Praevarica∣tio
dulcis: Every Sin is sweet.</HI> Yea, what is
yet more astonishing, is, That the Bishops for∣bid
all Priests upon pain of Suspension and
Imprisonment, to celebrate Mass in the Con∣vents
of Nuns, without having an express
Permission for so doing; by which they suffi∣ciently
give to understand, the ill Opinion
they have conceiv'd of their Nuns.</P>
<P>I have found amongst my Papers one of
those Licenses, which I got at <HI>Venice,</HI> in order
to say Mass in two Churches of Nuns, which
are therein specified. The Contents of this
Licence seems to me curious enough to de∣serve
a Publication; it is Printed, and begins
in these Terms.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>We may easily perceive from all this, the
high Opinion the Pastors of the Church of
<HI>Rome</HI> have of the Virtue of their Holy Re∣cluses;
and without question they have reason
for their taking all these measures about them.
The Priests are forbid to speak with them, be∣cause
Experience hath taught, that in their
Discourse they did only Cajole and Court them.
They are forbid to make them any Presents,
because they are well assured, that the Priests
never give any thing for nought. And in the
third place, they forbid them having any Com∣merce
with them in any other manner; I leave
<PB N="153" REF="89"/>
it to you to conjecture what the meaning of
that may be.</P>
<P>The Priests, for their parts, do not much
concern themselves with all these Threats.
They say, That Suspension <HI>Ipso facto</HI> signifies
nothing, except it be publickly declared by a
Sentence; and they know well enough, that
their Colleagues will never proceed to such an
Extremity against them; forasmuch as in their
time, they have been as guilty of the same
Transgression, as themselves. Some will have
it, That the Punishment of Suspension with
the rest exprest in the Licence, cannot light
upon any, but such who are guilty of all
the Particulars there prohibited, that is, who
Discourse with, send Presents, write to them,
and have commerce with them; but that they
who discourse, or have commerce with them,
without Writing, are not of that number.
In a word, The most Clear-sighted perceive,
that these Prohibitions are only made to se∣cure
the Honour of the Superiors, who other∣wise
might be accused by the Seculars, for
conniving at all these Disorders, which daily
happen in these Matters, and which, according
to a Jesuitical Interpretation, are sufficient to
quiet their Consciences. They say, That the
Bishops after all, never had the intention of
Suspending them. Thus notwithstanding they
Court the Nuns, yet they continue to say Mass,
and to perform all the Sacerdotal Functions,
without feeliny the least scruple in so doing.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="90"/>
The <HI>Italians</HI> do not always pay their Visits
to the Nuns for the Love they bear them, but
more frequently to consult with them, and
concert the means of accomplishing some
great design, or to manage some Intriegue
abroad. The Nuns commonly have the quali∣fication
of a Devilish Spirit, and it is matter
of astonishment to see, how young Women
shut up in Cloysters, as in a Prison, are not∣withstanding
able to act at a great distance
with so much power and efficacy. Is a Man
engaged in an unjust Trial, or does he stand in
need of the Favour of some Great Person; the
best means for him to succeed, next to the
Jesuits, is to address himself to the Nuns. Has
a Man a mind to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mpass some Amorous pro∣ject;
if you can but once get them to embark
in it, you may be in a manner sure of suc∣ceeding.
I shall to this purpose relate to you,
the subtil Intriegue of a Nun of <HI>Milan.</HI></P>
<P>A certain Count courted a young Lady,
whom he was extreamly pleas'd with; but he
had no means of seeing her, save only at
Church, when she went on Sundays to Mass,
or sometimes in passing by her Window, after
the <HI>Italian</HI> manner. He had taken notice of
the young Ladies Smiling on him, and from
thence concluded, that without doubt she
would prove favourable to his Wishes: So that
nothing remained now, but the finding out a
way for a free and secret Interview, wherein
the Count found an insuperable difficulty;
<PB N="155" REF="90"/>
for her Mother, who was a Woman of Honour,
was so true a Sentinel to her Daughter, that
she was inseparable from her, and never stirr'd
out of Doors without taking her along with
her. This was a business indeed, that requir'd
the Intriegue of a Nun to compass it. He ad∣dresseth
himself to an Ancient Mother of the
Monastery <HI>Magiore,</HI> to whom he promis'd 20
Crowns, in case she could make him obtain his
desire: The Old Nun undertakes it. To this
effect she writes a Letter to the Lady, wherein
she desires her to come and speak with her, for
that she had some secret and charitable Ad∣vice
to give her concerning the Carriage of
her Daughter, and signifies the Hour, which
would be most proper for her to come. The
Mother being very impatient to know what
the matter might be, did not fail of going to
her, leaving her Daughter at Home. When
she was come, the Nun told her, That she had
sent for her, to put her in mind to double her
Care in observing her Daughter; that it was
taken notice of, that a Count was passionately
enamour'd of her; and that her Daughter
answer'd him with Casts of her Eye. She made
a shift, with her long Discourse, to stay this
good Woman near two Hours in the Parlour;
and all this while the Count, who had received
all necessary Instructions, was with the young
Gentlewoman. The Mother return'd to her
House, with a Resolution to make good use of
the Advice the Nun had given her; but the
<PB N="156" REF="91"/>
more assiduous her Precautions were, the more
reason she found to be astonish'd, after some
Months at her Daughters, being big with
Child. She urged her to that degree, that she
oblig'd her to declare how the thing had hap∣ned.
But what could the Mother do? It
would have been in vain for her to have un∣dertaken
to trouble the Nun upon this account,
because in so doing, besides the loss of her
Daughters Honour, she might very well have
lost her own Life into the bargain; for the
Nuns are no less able and expert in bringing
about their Revenge, than in managing a
Love intriegue. The most part of the violent
Deaths that hapen in <HI>Italy,</HI> are carried on by
their means, and therefore it is that I have
said, that they have a devilish Spirit. Those
that have any Enemies in <HI>Italy,</HI> are very cau∣tious
of drinking any Liquors of their Pre∣paring,
or of their Sweet-Meats, or Pastry-Work.
There are too many funest Examples
to this purpose.</P>
<P>There is to be seen in the Mad-house at
<HI>Milan</HI> a poor Gentleman, whom they make
to pass for a Fool or Madman, tho' indeed
he be not so. The thing was brought about
by the Stratagem of a Nun, the account was
given me of it, is as follows. This Gentleman
had a younger Brother, who was desirous to
make himself Master of his Estate; in order
whereunto he took occasion to get his Brother
go along with him to Visit the Nuns, who be∣stowed
<PB N="157" REF="91"/>
a Collation upon them, and the Elder
Brother having drunk a Dose, fell down to
the Ground, as if he had been quite Dead.
However the Poison it seems had not been
so well prepared, but that he came to himself
again. The Nuns in the mean time being ex∣treamly
concern'd that their design had not
succeeded, Published that he was a Fool, and
that they had seen him carry himself like a
Changeling in the Parlour: Whereupon his
Brother caused him to be Seized, and to be
carried to the Mad-house. It is a place from
whence no Body is ever suffer'd to come forth,
and where all the actions and words of those,
whom they have once thrust in there, be they
never so rational and compos'd, are interpre∣ted
and wrested to Folly. It was to special
purpose for him to say there that the Nuns had
Poisoned him, when they made that a strong
argument to prove him a Fool, for entertain∣ing
such thoughts of them. And by this
means his younger Brother is at present still
in full Possession of his Estate. This was the
account they gave me of this Story.</P>
<P>That which makes the Nuns so bold and
daring in these sort of Enterprises, is, because
the Civil Magistrate cannot take cognisance of
any thing they do, and their Superiors that
Govern them, receive too many good Treats
from them, ever to use them roughly. Be∣sides,
the most Rigorous Sentence that can be
Pronounced against them, is to Condemn
<PB N="158" REF="92"/>
them to be shut up in the inmost part of their
Monastery, and to Fast so many days a Week,
with Bread and Water. They themselves do
execute the Sentence, for no Body hath the
power to enter into their Convents to force
them to it; so that we must not imagine them
to be such Fools, as to be overcruel to one
another. And if an Abbess or Superiour,
should attempt to have the Sentence executed
according to the Rigor of it, they would get
the whole Body of Nuns about their Ears. So
that by this means, they are secur'd from the
fear of ever dying an infamous Death; yea,
or so much as to suffer any thing considerable,
whereas a poor Secular Female, being con∣vinc'd
of the like Crimes, would be drag'd to
the Gallows, or Burnt alive. Nay, there are
some who excuse them of all these Enormi∣ties,
upon the account of their being Reclu∣ses;
for why do the Seculars, say they, go to
them? We must not come near the Beast, if
we have no mind to be bit by it. And they,
on the other hand, conceive they may justly
deceive the World, because they have once
for good and all deceived them, and made
them lose their Liberties, by forcing them
to become Nuns.</P>
<P>The Roman Catholicks may well expect
that these Monstrous Vocations, will one day
produce nothing but Monsters. 'Tis too great
a Violence done to the natural Right, which
every one hath to his Liberty, to pretend to
<PB N="159" REF="92"/>
force people to a Condition, which they can
never after change: But it is still a greater
Tyranny to handle those as the most infamous
Criminals, who make the least attempt for to
recover it. The following History which is
a very true one, and happened at <HI>Milan</HI> about
four years ago whilst I was there, is a most
sensible proof thereof. A <HI>Dominican</HI> Nun of
the Number of those; whom their Parents
force to shut themselves up in a Cloister, hav∣ing
made serious Reflections upon her engage∣ment,
found that her Parents in order to de∣ceive
her the better, had falsified the Date of
the Extract, which they had taken out of the
Register of her Baptism, and had made her
a year older than indeed she was, to engage
her the sooner in a Monastick Life. For it
is to be noted, that the Canons declare all
those Professions to be Null and Void, which
are made before a certain Age, there pre∣scribed,
tho' there be but one day wanting;
and our Religious was not ignorant of it.
She therefore resolved to quit her self of her
Profession, as being null and invalid. The
Abbess of the Convent gave advice thereof
to her Parents, who immediately repaired to
the Monastery, and having given a conside∣rable
Sum of Mony to the Abbess, they de∣sired
her to joyn with them, to hinder her
coming out from thence. The shortest and
surest way was to make her pass for a Fool.
Accordingly the Abbess and some of her Con∣fidents
<PB N="160" REF="93"/>
Publish'd that her Brains were crackt;
but because she was not so Craz'd, but that
she could upon occasion, give good Reasons
of what she said, she was forbid the Parlour,
and never suffer'd to come to the Grates. Thus
this poor Creature was forc'd to live in this de∣solate
manner for some years, without being
able to come to the Speech of any Body.
In the mean time, having dexterously ma∣nag'd
the Spirit of a Converse Sister, she took
upon her to deliver a Letter from her, to the
Cardinal Archbishop, to whom only it be∣longs
to take Cognisance of the Affairs of
Nuns in extraordinary Cases. She most humb∣ly
represented to him, in her Letter, the rea∣sons
she had to reclaim or retract her Pro∣fession,
and the great Cruelties which the Ab∣bess,
at the Instigation of her Parents, had ex∣ercised
against her, since they had discover'd
her Intent. The Cardinal far from being
touch'd by the Justice of these Remonstran∣ces,
suppos'd, that by granting her Request,
he would give an occasion to the rest of the
Nuns, to follow her steps, and make them de∣sirous
to examine the day and hour of their
Professions: Wherefore he immediately sent
his Orders to the Abbess, to shut her up more
closely than before; conformable to which
Order, she was shut up in the inward Prison
of the Monastery, where she continued five
years, with the allowance only of a little
Bread and Water for her Nourishment, and
<PB N="161" REF="93"/>
being cruelly Whipt thrice a Week. The
Nuns, as I have said before, exercise a very
sweet and mild Justice one towards another;
but if there be any found amongst them, who
have a mind to quit the Convent, to these
they are inexorably Pitiless and Cruel. They
fear, lest being got out from amongst them,
they might Divulge the infamous Wickedness
they commit, and as an honest Man told me,
they are of the humour of the Devils, who
wish Men would Damn themselves, to have
the more Company in Hell. <HI>Solatium mise∣rorum
est habere Pares: 'Tis a comfort to mise∣rable
Persons that they are not alone.</HI> Our poor
Prisoner in this her extream Misery found none,
but this same Converse Sister, who had deli∣ver'd
her Letter to the Cardinal, that had
any pity for her, who took upon her, to de∣liver
another Letter for her, which she had
addrest to an Honest Gentleman, in whom
she had a great deal of Confidence; who ac∣cordingly
resolv'd with one of his Friends, to
do his utmost endeavour to set her at Liberty.
He, by means of this Converse Sister, furnisht
her with Instruments to break her Prison;
and on a certain Night, according to the Mea∣sures
they had before taken, they drew her
with Cords over the Wall, and being entred
into the Coach, that stood ready for her, she
desir'd the Gentlemen to carry her to <HI>Genoa.</HI>
The Nuns in the mean time, took so chari∣table
a care of this poor Creature, that a day
<PB N="162" REF="94"/>
and almost two Nights past, before ever they
perceiv'd that she had made her escape; and
she was already arriv'd at <HI>Genoa,</HI> before the
Report of it came to <HI>Milan.</HI> The Nun be∣ing
got to <HI>Genoa,</HI> about Eleven a Clock at
Night, made the Gates to be open'd to her,
and having taken up her Lodging in the best
Inn, she presently sent to acquaint one of the
Principal Magistrates of the City, that she de∣sir'd
some Body might immediately be sent to
take the care of her, and to discharge the
two Gentlemen, that had brought her thither,
that all might be satisfi'd of their Honesty
and good intent in this Undertaking; and
that they had not endeavour'd to Steal her
away upon any motive of Licentiousness.
This Sage and prudent behaviour of hers,
which did not at all bespeak her a Fool, as her
Enemies misrepresented her, was well approv'd
of by the Magistrates of <HI>Genoa.</HI> They re∣ceiv'd
her with extraordinary kindness, and
promis'd to afford her their utmost Assistance.
They appointed Commissaries to receive the
Reasons of her leaving the Monastery, and
having found them good and just, they writ
to the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> to inform his Holiness
what had past, and to receive his Orders about
it. It was in the Papacy of <HI>Innocent</HI> XI. who
was a great Enemy to all those, who deserted
their Convents; for they say of him, that he
sent to the Gallies every one of the Monks,
who after having quit their Monasteries,
<PB N="163" REF="94"/>
humbly addrest themselves to him for Relief,
without hearing any of their Reasons. Con∣formable
to this Humor of his, he order'd the
Magistrates of <HI>Genoua,</HI> not to meddle any
more in that matter; and immediately to send
back the Nun to her lawful Superior, the Car∣dinal
Archbishop of <HI>Milan,</HI> who would take
care to do her Justice.</P>
<P>This Order was very cruel; for this Cardi∣nal
being accused by the Nun, for having
been so far from hearing her Remonstrance,
when she had recourse to him, that he caused
her to be Imprisoned and Abused, was become
her most dangerous Adversary. This made
these Gentlemen, to write a second time to the
Pope, to represent to him these Inconveniences,
and to discharge their Consciences. But <HI>Inno∣cent</HI>
the XIth was too firm in whatsoever he
had once resolved on, (and it may be this was
the only Fault he had) and redoubled his for∣mer
Orders, with greater expresness than be∣fore,
threatning them (in case of delay) with
Excommunication. Thus these Gentlemen, who
were unwilling to involve themselves in Trou∣ble
for the sake of a Nun, sent her back three
Months after, with a good Guard, to <HI>Milan:</HI>
Every one pitied her condition, and believed
the Archbishop would receive Orders from
<HI>Rome,</HI> for to hear her Case. But in the mean
time, she was sent back to her Convent, and
the Nuns shut her up in her Dungeon, and
three or four Months after she was never heard
<PB N="164" REF="95"/>
of more. <HI>English</HI> Women have great reason
to bless GOD, that such a Barbarous Tyranny
is at last abolish'd in <HI>England;</HI> for they may be
sure, that if ever <HI>Popery</HI> should set her Foot in
<HI>England</HI> again, they would not fail to build
Prisons for them every where (I mean Mo∣nasteries,)
where, in spight of their Teeth, they
would be made to renounce the World. It
being therefore a thing in a manner impossible,
for a Nun ever to get out of a Monastery,
it is much better for them never to think of
it.</P>
<P>Now forasmuch as the Profession of renounc∣ing
the World, does not make one really dye
to it; so they seem, on the contrary, to have
taken the resolution of cleaving to it more than
ever, and to follow the Maxims of it, as far as
is possible for them to do, and more than it
may be they ever would have done, had they
staid in it. Their Habit ought to be very plain,
without Pride or Affectation; but we find that
they have been very ingenious in reducing
them to another pass. Only setting Silk aside,
which they may not wear, they use the finest
and most curious Woollen Stuffs they can
meet with; and every thing about them is so
neatly made, and to that degree of Curiosity
and Exactness, that there is no uneven Fold or
Stich to be found in them; and certainly, there
be a great many to whom a Religious Habit
is much more advantagious, than a Secular, a
making them to appear more comly and hands
<PB N="165" REF="95"/>
som. Some of them let their Hair grow on
the fore-part of their Heads, and take great
care in frizling of it. They wear also Laced
Head-dresses under their Veils, as likewise
Neck-Laces, Bracelets, and Pendants in their
Ears; and in a word, the most of them Paint
themselves to excess.</P>
<P>I went once to ask leave to speak with a
Nun of the Monastery of S. <HI>Thomas</HI> at <HI>Vicenza.</HI>
She made me stay for her an Hour and an half
in the Parlour, and came at last so Curl'd and
Painted, that she e'en frighted me. She excus'd
her self, for having made me stay so long, be∣cause
forsooth, she durst not present her self
before me disorderly. This Nun gave me a
plain and downright description of all that
past in her Monastery; the Antipathies, the
Jealousies, the Amorous Intriegues, and the
Parties that reign'd amongst them. They were
at that time in a great Division amongst them∣selves;
some being of the Emperor's Faction,
others of the <HI>French</HI> Kings. They who were
of the Emperor's Side, could not endure to
hear the others speak well of his Enemy. There
hapned one day (as she told me) a very furious
Battle between them, upon this account.</P>
<P>A Nun at Dinner-time drunk a Health to the
<HI>French</HI> King: The <HI>Imperialists</HI> not being able
to brook it, they came to Words, and from
Words to Blows. They flung the Dishes and
Plates, and whatsoever else came next to hand,
at one anothers Heads; she shewed me her Veil,
<PB N="166" REF="96"/>
which was yet all stained with a Sawce out of
a Dish they had flung at her. This vexed her
more than all the rest; for the <HI>Italian</HI> Women,
but more especially the Nuns, are exceeding
neat and cleanly: She endeavour'd her Re∣venge
in flinging a Chasing-dish full of hot
Coals in the Face of the Party that had thus
Affronted her. And she continued to demand
of me, Whether there might not be means
found to signifie her Bravery to the <HI>French</HI>
King, and that she doubted not, but that if he
were informed of the Zeal she had for his
Glory, he would send for her to <HI>Paris,</HI> and make
her an Abbess there. These poor Maidens are
very apt to intoxicate themselves with a thou∣sand
such like Fancies. When they are weary
of Quarrelling and beating one another, then
they betake themselves to Jesting and Fooling,
and compose Comedies and Farces to make
one another Laugh.</P>
<P>The Reverend Dr. <HI>Burnet,</HI> now Lord Bishop
of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> did not exaggerate the matter,
when he saith, That <HI>He had seen some of them
that were not over modest.</HI> They make no diffi∣culty
of representing in their Plays, <HI>Venus</HI>'s
and <HI>Lucretia</HI>'s wholly to the Life; they Sing
profane Songs, and altogether unworthy and
unbecoming Persons consecrated to God; they
act Dances and Postures that are extream Lasci∣vious,
and all that they speak in them, is
commonly conceiv'd in Terms admitting a
double signification, whereof one sense is al∣ways
<PB N="167" REF="96"/>
either impious or wanton. They com∣monly
have very excellent Voices, and under∣stand
Musick perfectly well; but if there be
any impure or lascivious Air, that is that which
pleaseth them best, and which they make
choice of, to entertain the Company with.
That which is the most enormous thing of all,
is, that not only in these their Comedies, but
also (O unheard of Profanation!) in their
Divine Offices for Sundays and Festivals, they
intermix these filthy Songs, which they blas∣phemously
pretend to be made in imitation of
the <HI>Song</HI> of <HI>Solomon.</HI> All the Debauched Youth
of the City, about this time, flock'd to the
Church of the <HI>Coelestines</HI> at <HI>Milan,</HI> where these
Nuns equally tickled their Ears and Fancies
by the sweetness and lasciviousness of their
Songs. The Scandal grew at last to that Ex∣cess,
that the Cardinal sent his Orders to have
their Church shut up, and absolutely forbad
them to sing Musick any more.</P>
<P>'Tis the Custom in the World, for Men to
Court Women; but in these Religious Orders,
on the contrary, the Nuns Court the Men;
they write Amorous Notes to them; they send,
to entreat them to come and see them; and
there are few Nuns, that have not two or
three, to whom they are more particularly
linked in Affection; and they are so well skill'd
in disposing their Timos, that they never meet
together in the Parlour. They are very Jealous
of them, and should they once understand, that
<PB N="168" REF="97"/>
any one of their Lovers had discours'd with
any other Nun, besides themselves, they would
immediately quit them, and would find a time
to be revenged on them. I take them to be
very unhappy in this, That they desire so
strongly, what is so difficult for them to enjoy.
Some amongst them do so far enflame their
Imaginations about their Amours, that they
run Distracted; and others are so immoveably
determind to what they long for, that they
actually apply themselves to the inventing of
Means, that may bring them to the possession
of what they desire: Of these, some give
themselves to the Devil; and to this purpose
they tell a Story, That upon a time, a Nun
being resolved to give her self to the Devil;
He plainly told her, <HI>He would not have her, be∣cause
she was more Devil than himself.</HI> 'Tis for
this Reason that we are told so many Stories
of Nuns, that are Possessed. Others endeavour
for Mony to corrupt the Turn Keys and Maid-Servants,
that have the Care of the Outward-Gates,
to admit their Gallants at Night by the
Tower. Some have pluck'd away whole Grates
from the Parlours; others have broke through
the Walls, or have made Passages under∣gro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d;
and it happens frequently enough,
th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> their Cunning, they get the Keys of
the Great Gate of the Monastery from under
the Lady Abbesses Pillow; or that they are so
happy to meet with one Key or other, that can
unlock it. There is also another Little Gate in
<PB N="169" REF="97"/>
the Vestries, by which the Priests enter, to go
and carry the Holy Sacrament and Extream
Unction to those that are Sick, and by which
they convey the Ornaments of the Altar:
Now, to get the possession of this Door, they
need only to gain her who is over the Vestry.
But the most sure way to obtain their desires, is,
when a whole Community of Females agree
together, to take their Pleasures. Of this
there hapned a most infamous Instance, about
seven or eight Years since, amongst the Nuns
of <HI>Bresse,</HI> which made a great deal of Noise in
<HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>These Religious finding themselves quite
weary of keeping their Vow of <HI>Chastity,</HI> agreed
amongst themselves to admit their Lovers into
the Monastery, and having all bound them∣selves
in an Oath of Secrecy, they wrought
hard, to make a Passage Under-ground, under
the Walls of their Enclosure, and which was
to end in the House of a young Gentleman,
who was one of the Plot. Their Undertaking
had so good success, that the Nuns enjoy'd the
Galants as often as they pleased. In the mean
time there was observed a great change in
these Recluses; they became more modest in
the Parlour, and more assiduous in the Quire,
than ever the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> had been before. Their Con∣fessor,
who was a very Aged Man, being inca∣pable
of taking part in their Amours, was not
thought fit to be admitted to the Secret. They
informed him in their Confessions and secret
<PB N="170" REF="98"/>
Conferences, that they felt from time to time
such Ravishments and Internal Joys, as they
could no way express; without telling him,
whether they belong'd to the Soul or Body.
And this good Man, who took all in the best
sense, and who also attributed in part this
their Conversion, to his own good Prayers for
them, went to the Bishop of <HI>Bresse,</HI> and made
his Report to him; telling him, That <HI>his Nuns
were all of them become Saints to that degree, as
to suffer Exstasies and Ravishments.</HI> The great
Opinion the World had conceived of their
Sanctity still increased more and more, when
the greatest part of these Nuns undertook to
observe a Six Months Retirement in the Inner
part of their Monastery; making a Vow, That
during all that time they would never come to
the Grate: This was to hide their Big-bellies,
and Child-bearing.</P>
<P>In a word, they had many Children, and
this infamous Commerce lasted many years.
The World has been since astonished to con∣sider,
how it was possible to be concealed for
so long a time, without making a Noise in
the World; for there were above a Score of
Youths that were of the Gang. However, as
Wickedness always drags its own Chain, this
also was discover'd at last by the Cook-Maid.
This Sister finding her self abandoned and
neglected, because she was very Ugly; and
moreover, finding her self overcharg'd with
Work, by reason of the Cawdles and Broths,
<PB N="171" REF="98"/>
and a thousand other extraordinary things,
which she was oblig'd to make for those that
were in Child-Bed. Besides, whenever the
young Galants came at Night, they always
brought some dainty Bit or other along with
them, which she must Dress for the rest. One
of the Nuns, on a time, having very indis∣creetly
jeared her for the bigness of her Nose,
she was so extreamly nettled at it, that in
Revenge, she by way of Raillery reproach'd
her with her Big-Belly: From these stinging
Jests, they proceeded to high Words, and in
fine, the Cook-Maid was basely abus'd by them.
The next Morning she sends a Letter to the
Vicar-General of <HI>Bresse,</HI> wherein she informed
him, That she had a Matter of great conse∣quence
to disclose to him, provided care were
taken to secure her Life from the Revenge of
the other Nuns. The Grand-Vicar was so
possest with the high Esteem he had conceiv'd
for these Recluses, who of late had undertaken
the Reforming of themselves, with so much
Edification, that having heard what the Cook-Maid
had to say, he immediately called her a
Visionary. But she persisting to maintain what
she had discovered to him; and offering to
make it appear, that three of the Nuns were
actually with Child, and that two of them had
been lately brought to Bed; the Grand-Vicar
at last resolv'd to perform a Visitation of the
Convent. Many of the Nuns perceiving, that
there was something extraordinary in this
<PB N="172" REF="99"/>
Proceeding, endeavoured to make escape out
of the Monastery; but they were all stopt in
their flight, and brought back to their Con∣vent,
where they found very pretty Children,
Males and Females, in the Cells of these Nuns,
who call'd them their Mothers.</P>
<P>The Bishop having been inform'd of it,
drew up an Indictment, and sent it in all dili∣gence
to the Tribunal of <HI>Venice,</HI> which is
established to take cognizance of Matters re∣lating
to Nuns; (for <HI>Bresse</HI> is a <HI>Venetian</HI> City,
depending upon the Republick both in Tem∣porals
and Spirituals.) This Tribunal is very
severe, and never fails of punishing things with
the extreamest vigour. In the mean time all
the Young Men, who knew themselves guilty,
had time to save themselves, some in <HI>Swisser∣land;</HI>
others in the Country of the <HI>Grissons;</HI> and
others in <HI>Germany,</HI> as having by good-luck
nothing but the <HI>Alpes</HI> to pass. Some days after, a
Sentence was pronounc'd and publish'd against
them, as severe as ever had been seen. Their
Goods were confiscated, their Houses razed to
the ground, and their Heads set at a price. I
was troubled to find amongst this number one
of my Scholars, the Son of a Procurator of
S. <HI>Mark;</HI> but some time after, I had the satis∣faction
to understand, That he was come freely
of his own accord, to put himself in Prison, in
order to his Justification; which he did to so
good purpose, that he was acquitted.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="99"/>
There were many Persons in <HI>Italy,</HI> especially
amongst the Priests and Nuns, who condem∣ned
this so severe and so publick Proceeding of
the Republick, which had made the matter to
be much more Nois'd abroad, than otherwise
it would have been. They said, it would have
been much better to have supprest it wholly,
as they do at <HI>Rome,</HI> and in all the other Go∣vernments
of <HI>Italy;</HI> because the Hereticks on
the other side of the Hills, and more especi∣ally
<HI>Geneva,</HI> are never wanting, when such
Matters as these happen, to make the best Ad∣vantage
of it, or, to make use of their Phrase,
to <HI>Butter their Cabbage with it.</HI> As for the Nuns,
they contented themselves with setting a strict
Guard upon them for some time, and with
stopping up the Conveyance they had made
under their Walls. For above a year together,
the Gentlemen of <HI>Bresse</HI> durst not pass along the
Streets, near to their Monastery, for fear of
incurring a sinister Suspicion. See here the
common End of the Amorous Intriegues of
Nuns, and tho' indeed they do not always
make so much Noise, it is because those who
ought to take cognizance of them, pretend to
have more Prudence than the Tribunal of
<HI>Venice</HI> made use of on this occasion.</P>
<P>There be two sorts of Superiors of Nuns in
<HI>Italy;</HI> for some of them are immediately sub∣ject
to Bishops, and others to some Generals
of Orders, of the same Rule that they profess.
Those that are under the Conduct of Bishops,
<PB N="174" REF="100"/>
are somewhat better Govern'd; but they
who are under the inspection of Monks, do
for the most, wholly give the Reins to their
Passions, and lead a most infamous Life, tho'
with less Noise. The Monks will scarcely
ever suffer any Seculars to frequent the Grates
of those whom they Govern, that they may
keep the Affections of these Maidens entirely
to themselves. If any disorder chance to hap∣pen,
all is kept very secret, because this would
turn as much to their Dishonour, as to the
disgrace of the Nuns. There are a Thousand
Stories abroad in the World, of the Loves of
Monks and Nuns, and I find no difficulty to
give credit to them, since the Information I
my self have had thereof, during my abode
in <HI>Italy,</HI> from Persons, whom I can belive;
but am resolv'd to pass them by in silence,
for fear of offending Chast Ears.</P>
<P>'Tis a Prodigious thing to see how Nuns
have multipli'd themselves in <HI>Italy,</HI> and the
vast quantity of Convents they have, as well
in every City, as in the Country. There are
almost as many different Orders of them, as
there are of Monks. Amongst the rest there
are also She Jesuits, which commonly are
call'd <HI>Ursulines,</HI> who more particularly un∣dertake
to Instruct Young Girls. In <HI>Italy</HI>
they are oblig'd to be Cloister'd, tho' in
<HI>Switzerland</HI> and in <HI>France,</HI> they are not under
that engagement. I was surpriz'd to see that
the <HI>Italians,</HI> who are accus'd of be∣ing
<PB N="175" REF="100"/>
become so effeminate some Ages since,
have not yet introduc'd amongst them a plea∣sant
Order of Nuns, which is extreamly
multipli'd in <HI>France;</HI> I mean that of <HI>Fonte∣vrault,</HI>
which contains something so odd in its
Institution, and in its Observances, that for∣asmuch
as I do not believe I shall have any
opportunity of entertaining you further about
Nuns, I suppose you will not find it disagree∣able,
if I give you here a short Relation of
them, if it were for nothing else but to re∣present
to you, to what a height Folly
and Delusion are mounted in the Church of
<HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>A Person whose Name was <HI>Robert d' Ar∣brissel,</HI>
having been followed by a great num∣ber
of Men and Women, in the Woods of
<HI>Fontevrault,</HI> who had been persuaded by his
Preachments to embrace a Monastick Life,
he gave them the Habit, and placed them in
several Cels in the Year 1100. And being
of a very complaisant Humour for the Sex,
he undertook to overthrow the Order of God,
and of Nature, to oblige Women, by giving
them the Superiority over Men. Some say he
did this, because of the great Devotion he
had to the Blessed Virgin, and more parti∣cularly
to honour the Recommendation Jesus
Christ made of S. <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Evangelist</HI> to his
Mother, when he was upon the Cross, as
may be seen in the XIX Chap. of the Gos∣pel
of S. <HI>John,</HI> Vers. 26, and 27. <HI>When Je∣sus
<PB N="176" REF="101"/>
therefore saw his Mother, and the Disciple
standing by, whom he loved; he saith unto his
Mother, Woman, behold thy Son. Then saith he
to the Disciple, behold thy Mother. And from
that Hour that Disciple took her to his own Home.</HI>
He pretended it might be gather'd from
hence, that Women were to Command Men;
at least he conceiv'd, that Men acquired a
greater degree of Perfection, by submitting
themselves to be obedient to them. Accor∣dingly,
he would have the Monks should
oblige themselves by a Solemn Vow of Obe∣dience
to the Nuns, and make Profession be∣tween
the hands of the Lady Abbess. Pope
<HI>Paschal</HI> confirm'd his Order, which since that
time multiplied exceedingly, especially in
<HI>France,</HI> where it had its first Rise. It hath
been the wonder of these last Ages, why the
Popes have suffer'd so long an Order, which
may with good reason be lookt upon as the
greatest Shame and Reproach of the Religi∣ous
Orders of the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> Endea∣vours
have been made, to persuade some of
the late Popes to suppress it, but the great
Ladies that have been Abbesses thereof, Fif∣teen
of them having been Princesses, and
amongst them Five of the House of <HI>Bourbon,</HI>
have had so much Power, that by the inter∣position
of the Authority Royal, they have
always hindred it. It is the Sister of Madam
<HI>de Montespan,</HI> who at present is their Lady
Abbess; she met with abundance of opposi∣tion
<PB N="177" REF="101"/>
at first, for these Nuns who were already
accustom'd, of a long time, to have none but
Princesses for their Abbesses, would not ac∣cept
of her; and that which made them the
more to distaste her was, the motive for
which this place was bestowed on her; how∣ever
the absolute Will of the King, has in fine
prov'd instead of a Principality to her. I am
in a Condition to acquaint you with some
Specialities, concerning the present Conditi∣on
and Spirit of this Linsey Woolsey Order;
for having had two Uncles that were Monks,
and an Aunt that was a Nun of that Com∣munity,
whom I often went to Visit; I
came by this means to be very particularly
informed about them.</P>
<P>In the first place to give you some Descripti∣on
of the Abby of <HI>Fontevrault.</HI> It is Situated
three Leagues from <HI>Saumur</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> upon the
Confines of <HI>Touraine.</HI> It was formerly a dismal
Place, full of Woods and Thickets; but at pre∣sent
it is very pleasant, as being extreamly well
cultivated and improv'd, and enjoys a very
good Air. There are Five Monasteries,
whereof Three are of Nuns, and Two of
Monks, without counting the Palace of the
Lady Abbess, which is a Stately Building.
The first of these Monasteries of Nuns, is
call'd the <HI>Great Montier,</HI> or the greater Mo∣nastery;
and in this all the Nuns of the Quire,
that have a good Voice, and are in Health,
are Lodged. The Offices are very regularly
<PB N="178" REF="102"/>
Sung here at all Hours, and the Church is a
curious fair Building, to Perfection, Spacious
and Sumptuous. There are about a hundred
and fifty Nuns profest in it, who continue
there till they grow Old or Weak and Infirm,
for then they are discharged of their Obser∣vance,
and from the Service of the Quire,
and are remov'd to the Monastery of S. <HI>Mag∣dalen,</HI>
which is destinated only for those Nuns,
that are Old or Distemper'd. They have no
other Obligation upon them, but to hear one
low Mass every day. Their Church also is a
very fair one, and they have very curious
Gardens. The Third Monastery of these
Religious Maids, is call'd the Novitiat, where
they have their Boarders and Novices. Here
they are taught whatsoever they have a desire
to, <HI>viz.</HI> to Work, to Sing by Notes, to
Dance, to Play upon Instruments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The
Fourth Monastery, which is for the Men, is
that of S. <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Evangelist,</HI> which contains
about Fourscore or an Hundred Monks, tak∣ing
in the Novices. Their Buildings and Cloi∣sters
are very Fair, but more especially their
Library, and their Refectory. The Fifth
Monastery is that which is call'd the <HI>Secretene∣rie,</HI>
and contains the Brothers Converses,
which are about Sixty in Number. They are
appointed for the Service of the Fathers,
when they are sent to be Directors to other
Religious Houses of the same Order. All these
Five Monasteries are extreamly well Built,
<PB N="179" REF="102"/>
have large Gardens, and their particular En∣closures;
but besides these, there is one great
Enclosure, which contains them all, and
makes a kind of City, Peopl'd with Monks
and Nuns. Without the grand Enclosure is
the Town of <HI>Fontevrault,</HI> Inhabited by all
sorts of Trades and Handicrafts-men, who gain
their Lively-hood by Working for the Abby,
and for the Strangers that come thither from
all Parts, either out of Curiosity, or to Visit
some of their Kindred. This Order contains
about Threescore Abbies of Nuns, who all
own that of <HI>Fontevrault</HI> for their Mother, and
depend on it. The Abbess is General of the
Order; 'tis she that performs the Visitation
of the Monasteries, sends them Directors
and Confessors, and recals them at her Plea∣sure.</P>
<P>The first time that ever I came to <HI>Fonte∣vrault,</HI>
I was between Fifteen and Sixteen
years of Age, and it was at the Sollicitation
of my Aunt, who was a Nun there, and
Mistress of the Novices, that I went thither.
Her design was to persuade me to become a▪
Monk of that Order, where she had already
gain'd abundance of Credit. I found also
my two Uncles there, who were of very diffe∣rent
Sentiments and Inclinations; for the one
of them, who was very well pleas'd with his
State of Obedience, endeavour'd, all he could,
to draw me into it; but the other, who had
a more noble Soul, talk'd to me of nothing
<PB N="180" REF="103"/>
else, but of the baseness and degeneracy of
Spirit there was, in making ones self a Slave
to Women. It is sometimes permitted in
the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> to remove from one
Order to another, provided it be from one of
greater Liberty to a stricter. Accordingly my
Uncle had done his utmost endeavour, to quit
the Order of <HI>Fontevrault,</HI> and to betake him∣self
to that of the Reformed <HI>Benedictins</HI> of the
Congregation of S. <HI>Maur.</HI> But Madam <HI>de Bour∣bon,</HI>
the last Princess of the Blood-Royal they
have had for their Lady Abbess, perceiving
that the best Subjects of her Order abandoned
it at last, by the natural shame and regret
they had to obey Women, by this means took
a course to shut this Back-Door. She had so
much Power, and so many Friends in the Court
of <HI>Rome,</HI> and she knew so well to represent,
that this Change would not be allowed of in
Conscience; forasmuch as her Order, tho'
otherwise very mild and slack, ought indeed,
(by reason of the blind Obedience which it
renders to the Inferior Sex) to be accounted
the most mortifying and abasing of all others,
that are approved by the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and
that consequently, according to the Canons it
could not be left, to go to another; That at last
she obtain'd a Bull from <HI>Rome,</HI> which declar'd,
<HI>That after Profession, none ever after should be able
to quit the Order, to enter into another.</HI> But whe∣ther
it were her Rank, and her Friends, or the
strength of her Arguments that prevail'd in
<PB N="181" REF="103"/>
this case, I will not determine. But by this
means all my Uncles designs were overthrown,
and he was forc'd by the Tenor of this Bull, to
continue in his first Calling, tho' sore against
his Will. He therefore did his utmost endea∣vour
to deter me, from Entring my self a Reli∣gious
there: And tho' I was but a Boy then,
I remember very well, that nothing was more
intolerable, than the Pride of these Nuns, who
(to exercise the Power they had of Command∣ing)
made them do all manner of Indignities,
Follies, and infamous Services, even to that
degree, as to make them undress themselves
Stark-naked before them in their Parlours, to
receive Discipline.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jesuits,</HI> who are the subtil Foxes, that
creep in every where, where they have the
prospect of Profit and Advantage, had so far
insinuated themselves into the Spirit of Madam
<HI>de Bourbon,</HI> that she chose them for her Confesaors,
and sent for two of them to be always about
her, as her Directors. This was the greatest
Affront that possibly she could have put upon
her own Monks, as if none amongst them all
had been able, or worthy to be her Spiritual
Father. In imitation of their Lady Abbess,
the other Nuns would needs have <HI>Jesuits</HI> for
their Confessors too; so that by this means,
these Fathers became very powerful at <HI>Fonte∣vrault;</HI>
and to the end they might be the
more respected, they had the Address to per∣suade
the Abbess, to command her Monks to
<PB N="182" REF="104"/>
obey them, and that the Obedience rendred to
them, should be look'd upon as paid to her self.
If there were a Petition to be presented, an
Office to be bestowed, and in a word, any
Favour to be demanded, all was to pass through
the <HI>Jesuits</HI> Hands. The Lady Abbess Sign'd
nothing, but what her Father Director had
first approv'd of. It was they that had all the
good and dainty Bits, and who devour'd all
their Sweet-meats and Confects. This you
must think was a very sensible Displeasure to
these Monks, who thereupon began to grow
very lean. But by good hap for them, tho' most
unhappily for the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> the Lady Abbess died;
and they had no sooner closed her Eyes, but
the <HI>Monks,</HI> in revenge of their Sufferings and
Disgraces, as one Man, fell upon the <HI>Jesuits,</HI>
and after having Lasht them very bountifully,
turn'd them shamefully out of the Monastery.
The Nuns might Cry their Hearts out from
their Parlours, commanding them to Treat the
Gentlemen civilly, and not to hurt them; the
Monks were resolved not to hear them, since
the Authority of the Abbess was no longer
there to restrain them.</P>
<P>My Uncle gave me a full Account of all the
Particulars of it: But my other Uncle, on the
contrary, did his utmost endeavour to persuade
me, to make one of them. He told me, That
their Obedience was not at all difficult to be
observ'd; that the Abbess and the Nuns com∣manded
them nothing, but such things as were
<PB N="183" REF="104"/>
sweet and easie, and that there was nothing
of Rigour in all their Observance; that they
were not oblig'd to Rise at Night; and kept
no other Fasts, save those of the Church; and
that after they had finished their Studies, they
were all advanc'd to be the Directors and
Confesssors of the Nuns of their Order, and
that then they were perfectly happy.</P>
<P>My Aunt, after this, sent for me into the
Parlour; where, after that she had made me
take part of a Collation, she told me a thou∣sand
pretty things, to engage me to be one of
them. I took occasion to object to her, what
her Elder Brother had told me, about their
giving Discipline to Men: She desired me, by
no means to give ear to him, as being a dis∣contented
Person, and enrag'd, because he
could not effect his Designs: Yet she could not
deny that such things past amongst them, but
that it was only upon young Novices, and
those that were newly profest, until they had
accomplish'd their Studies; that is to say, till
the Age of 25 Years. And forasmuch as these
were the very Stages, that I was to pass
through, in case I resolved to stay with them,
she told me, to soften the matter, and the
better to prepare me for it, That it was not
so harsh a thing, as probably I might imagin;
that all the Nuns of <HI>Fontevrault</HI> were Ladies
of Quality, and that it was a far greater Dis∣grace,
to receive Discipline from the hands of
a Monk, who often is no better than the Son
<PB N="184" REF="105"/>
of a Porter, or Cobler, than from them; and
besides, that this never hapned, but upon very
extraordinary Occasions, to try their Obedi∣ence.
In a word, she told me, That all this
was accounted as nothing amongst them, as
being accustom'd to such matters. However,
all these Reasons were not capable of satis∣fying
me, and I was oblig'd to cut short, and
tell her, That I felt no Call to the Religious
State, of what Order soever it might be; and
if it should please God to give me one here∣after,
he was to be Master, and that then I
would apply my self, with all my power to
follow it: And so desired her, to talk to me
no more about it.</P>
<P>I staid about Three Weeks with my Uncles
in the Monastery of S. <HI>Johns,</HI> and I ate always
at the Prior's Table in the Hall, where they
entertain their Strangers. A young Gentle∣man,
who came thither the same Day as I did,
only Supt there the Evening after our Arrival;
after which time, because he was come with
the design of Entring himself into their Order,
they made him Eat in the common Refectory,
together with the other Novices and Monks;
and Eight days after, they gave him the Habit.
The Master of the Novices being come one
Day to the Table for Strangers, where I was,
the Prior asked him, How the young Novice
behaved himself; who answered him, That he
did Wonders, and gave the marks of an extra∣ordinary
Fervor. Amongst other things, I
<PB N="185" REF="105"/>
remember he said, That <HI>He alone had almost
swept the whole Dormitory that Morning, and
that the Nune had already once called him into the
Parlour, from whence he return'd more joyful than
he went thither.</HI> The Monks that were there
Smil'd upon one another, and conceiv'd good
hopes, that he would persevere, seeing he had
made so good a beginning, and so well taken
his first Trial.</P>
<P>I had a great desire to go and see the
Monks Dine in the Common Refectory; but
they told me, I must stay till next <HI>Sunday,</HI> for
that it was not permitted to be there any other
Day of the Week, because of the Trials they
made of the Novices. My Uncle informed
me what these Trials were, <HI>viz.</HI> to make some
of them to carry a piece of Wood, or Gag in
their Mouths; others were commanded, to go
and kiss the Monks Shoes; others, to continue
upon their Knees, with their Arms across;
others again, to eat their Meals on the Ground,
without either Table-Cloth or Napkin, and an
hundred other such like Fooleries. The highest
Trial of all, is the Discipline, and they observe
a Nasty manner in the giving of it; for where∣as
in all other Religious Orders, they ordina∣rily
give it on their Shoulders, at <HI>Fontevrault</HI>
they always give it beneath. It was not long
since, that two Novices went to complain to
the Abbess, That the Prior handled them with
too great Severity; but the Abbess having
made them come into her Chamber, gave them
<PB N="186" REF="106"/>
as much more, to make them forbear their
Complaints to another. 'Tis in these Fooleries
they make Vertue to consist, and they never
teach their Religious, what it is to be Vertuous
indeed, <HI>viz.</HI> to mortifie, as they ought, their
Appetites, and to be meek and lowly of Heart.
This is that which makes these Young Men,
when they are past their Novitiate, and have
run through the Course of their Studies, to
have their Passions as head-strong as ever, and
to lead a scandalous Life with the Nuns, whose
Directors they are.</P>
<P>These Nuns have a great deal more Liberty
allow'd them, than those of other Orders;
their Grates are very spacious, and are not
double, as in <HI>Italy:</HI> They have the freedom to
enter into their Outward Churches, and Out∣ward
Parlours, which is not permitted to other
Nuns, and with leave from the Abbess they
may go abroad too. They will have all the
Publick Exercises of Learning to be performed
in their Presence, as all Latin Declamations
and Disputations. They have to this purpose
a very great Hall, which is call'd the <HI>Disputation-Hall,</HI>
and is of a great length and breadth,
having the Partition of a curious Iron-Grate
in the midst of it, all Gilt, the one half being
assign'd to the Nuns, and the other to the Fa∣thers,
who maintain the Dispute. There are
a great many Nuns amongst them, who do
very well understand Latin, yea, and, Philo∣sophy
too. It seems, that being to Command
<PB N="187" REF="106"/>
Men, they thought it fitting to take upon them
this Manly quality.</P>
<P>In a Second Journy, which I took about
Twelve years ago to <HI>Fontevrault,</HI> I heard some
Nuns Disputing very prettily upon some Meta∣physical
Points. They had conceiv'd a design
of establishing the Study of the Liberal Arts
amongst themselves; and indeed being the sole
Mistresses there, they might do in it whatsoever
they pleas'd. They said, <HI>They would give the
World a sensible demonstration, That it is a great
piece of Injustice done to the Sex, not to suffer
them to Study, only to keep them the more in Sub∣jection
and Error.</HI> As for what concerns Piety
and Devotion, these Nuns shew they have
but little of it, their whole Conversation
being extreamly Worldy and Lascivious, as
well as their Dress and Habit. They are
cloath'd in white, and wear a black Veil over
it: When they appear in the Quire, they wear
a great black Frock. The Monks wear a black
Cassock, and a Hood, and when they go to
Church they also put on a black Frock.</P>
<P>This is what I had to communicate to you
concerning this Religious Order, tho' not all
that I could say concerning them. It was to
great purpose indeed, that S. <HI>Paul</HI> affirms Man
to be the Head of the Woman, and that there∣fore
she ought to be subject and obedient to
him; seeing the Popes, who boast themselves to
be many degrees above S. <HI>Paul,</HI> have decisively
<PB N="188" REF="107"/>
declared on this occasion, that the Woman is
the Head of the Man, and who upon this ac∣count
is bound to yield Obedience to her. I
remember to have read in an English Author,
that formerly there were such like Abbies
in <HI>England,</HI> where the Women usurp'd Autho∣rity
over the Men. He mentions (amongst
others) the Abby of <HI>Repandune,</HI> and that of
<HI>Streneshaleh,</HI> where the Abbesses commanded
the Monks and Nuns, that were in the same
Monastery. But forasmuch as this Author doth
affect throughout all his Discourse, to oppose
himself to the <HI>Benedictins,</HI> who first brought
the Monastick Life along with them into this
Island, and that he racks his Brain to prove,
without any ground of Reason, That <HI>Joseph</HI>
of <HI>Arimathea</HI> (he who Buried our Lord Jesus)
came and Founded several Monasteries here,
Thirty years after the Death of our Saviour,
only to rob them of the glory, of having been
the first Founders; there is reason also to reject
what he saith concerning these Abbies, which
he pretends to be much more Ancient, than the
Arrival of S. <HI>Austin</HI> in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot be denied, but that there were
Communities of Religious Persons in the Pri∣mitive
Church, seeing the Apostles themselves,
for some time lived in Common, and the Be∣lievers
of both Sexes at that time, in imitation
of them, and by the necessity there was of
their being Instructed in the Faith and Duties
of Christianity; as likewise, that they might
<PB N="189" REF="107"/>
be in a better condition to provide for their
Poor, lived Charitably together, and in the
constant practice of all Religious Duties.
Wherefore it may be, that in this sense, and
after this manner, there may have been at the
first Preaching of the Gospel in <HI>England,</HI> some
of these kind of Communities, which were no
more than the first Converts, who lived toge∣ther
for the better convenience of being In∣structed,
to the end they might be in a condi∣tion
afterwards of Instructing others. I speak
now according to the Opinion of those, who
will have it, that the Gospel was Preached
in <HI>England,</HI> in the Apostles time, and by the
Apostles themselves; for according to the Sen∣timent
of others, who maintain, that S. <HI>Austin</HI>
was the first that Preached the Gospel in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
it is not improbable, but that he Founded
Monasteries here after the <HI>Roman</HI> manner, as
being a Monk himself. But these <HI>Romish</HI> Mo∣nasteries,
are very different from those Reli∣gious
Communities of the Primitive Church,
which were only Instituted for the Publick
Good, whereas these seem only to eye a Parti∣cular
Good, and to have abandon'd all the
Duties of Christian Charity towards their
Neighbour, for to live only to themselves; and
are in fine become to that degree the Scandal
of Christianity, that they are even asham'd of
their own Names. Let any Man go in <HI>France,</HI>
and desire to speak with a Monk or Nun, or
let him address a Letter to them with this
<PB N="190" REF="108"/>
Superscription, and they will find them more
offended at it, than if one had call'd them
Rogues and Queans: No, they will be called
<HI>Religious</HI> forsooth.</P>
<P><HI>There remains nothing for me at present,
but to answer a certain Question, which might
be put to me;</HI> Whether I, who have made it my
Business in my <HI>Italian</HI> Journies, to discover and
examine the Defects of those Females that live in
Monasteries, and who have here given a very
plain description of them; whether, I say, I would
by this seem to aver in Truth and Conscience, that
generally all of them are in this state of Corrup∣tion,
Malice, Sensuality, and Licentiousness, whereof
I have spoken?</P>
<P>To which I Answer, That I have not yet
made mention of another excess of Bigotry,
Superstition, Illusion and Folly, which predo∣minates
in a great number of Convents of
Nuns, and always in some one Nun or other,
even in those Monasteries that are the most
Corrupt and Licentious. Their Devotion con∣sists,
it may be, in Kneeling before some little
Saint of Wood they have in some Corner of
their Monastery, and to continue there in that
posture two or three Hours together every
day. Another undertakes to mumble over
daily a dozen <HI>Rosaries</HI> for the Souls in Purga∣tory;
and if any Sister come to speak with her
during that time, she affects to turn a deaf Ear
to her, for fear of interrupting her Prayers.
Another will go to the Middle of the Choir,
<PB N="191" REF="108"/>
and there lie prostrate upon the Ground, for a
long time together before the Holy Sacrament,
beat her Breast, stretch forth her Arms cross∣wise,
push forth great Sighs, and stare with
her Eyes, as if she were ravished and trans∣ported
in an Exstasie. Others undertake to
live on nothing but the Host, which they
receive at the Communion, for two or three
Days, during which time they abstain from all
manner of Meat, and by this means reduce
themselves to a pitiful condition. If any one
demands of them, why they pretend to do so,
they will tell you, that <HI>it is in hopes of becoming
Saints,</HI> and that this is their highest Ambition.
These poor Nuns have their Brains fill'd with
those miserable Legends of the Lives of Saints,
wherewith their Ears ring continually, and
where a great number of such like Actions are
related, for their most transcendent Vertues.
And accordingly they believe, that by doing the
same they shall become Saints likewise; and
there is more of a Worldly Ambition in the
case than is commonly thought of, to acquire
Reputation in a Church, where after Death
they place the Persons, that practise these kind
of Follies upon their Altars, in order to worship
them.</P>
<P><HI>It is not unlikely, but that a Nun may pos∣sibly
fill her Head with such Imaginations as
these;</HI> Go to, after that I have been frequent and
assiduous in these Actions, from whence the mea∣sures
of Holiness and Saintship are commonly taken,
<PB N="192" REF="109"/>
when once I am dead, they will make me a
Saintess, they'l cause a Head of Silver to be made,
in which they will enchase mine, they will enshrine
my Body, every one will strive to get a little bit
of my Skin, to dispose of it amongst their Relicks;
the Sisters will carry me on their Shoulders in Pro∣cession,
and come and Kneel before my Relicks, to
Pray to me, as we do to such and such a Saintess.
O, the Glory and Honour there is in being a Saint!
My greatest Ambition is to be one of them. <HI>With∣out
doubt, there be many Nuns in</HI> Italy <HI>that
give way to such Thoughts as these, and those
who have not the Talent of the World, do
incline to this Spiritual Ambition. They be∣come
insupportable in their Convents to their
Sisters themselves, and one may easily perceive
in all their Actions a most devilish Pride.</HI></P>
<P>These are the other sort of Nuns I have
taken notice of, and of whose Temper and
Actions I have had occasion fully and per∣fectly
to be inform'd. But yet I will not be
so rigid, as to say that amongst so great a
number of Nuns, there should not be sometime
found some good Soul, who with a right and
sincere Heart goes purely and simply to God;
tho' indeed never any one came to my know∣ledge,
for whom I could pass my word, as
far as mortal Men, who do not see the bottom
of the Heart, can do, for the Honesty of one
another; but yet I am willing to believe, that
there are some found amongst them that are
Good indeed, and exempt from those great
<PB N="193" REF="109"/>
Weaknesses that are found in the two Ex∣treams,
in like manner as we find some white
Crows here in <HI>England.</HI> But and if there
should be a greater number of these, yet
would not this enervate my Conclusion, which
is this, <HI>That when a State or Condition hath been
erected, in the hopes of attaining a greater Good;
if afterwards it be found, that contrary to the
good hope that has been conceived, it produceth a
great Evil; tho' it may be true also, that it is not
without good effect upon some, yet those who are in
Power are obliged in Conscience to abrogate it;</HI>
Which is that the Church of <HI>England</HI> hath
done, in suppressing the Monasteries of Men
and Women, wherewith the Country was so
miserably pester'd: For which GOD be
praised.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS
ON A
JOURNY
TO
NAPLES.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The Fourth Days Journy.</HEAD>
<P>WE departed from <HI>Fondi</HI> early in the
Morning, with design to reach <HI>Ca∣pua</HI>
that day. The Night before
they had told us many Stories of <HI>Banditi,</HI> who
not contenting themselves to Rob the Passen∣gers
they met with, most frequently took
them Prisoners along with them, and Sold
<PB N="195" REF="110"/>
them to the <HI>Turks,</HI> or the first Pirates they
met with, for Slaves. These <HI>Banditi</HI> Swarm
in the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> into which we
were entr'd the day before; for <HI>Fondi,</HI> is a
Town belonging to that Kingdom. We were
extreamly affrighted, after that we had Rode
Three or Four Miles, to see Four Men com∣ing
strait towards us, cross a Field, as if they
had a mind to intercept us. The only thing
encourag'd us was, that we saw no Arms
about them: But we soon recover'd of our
Fears, when instead of advancing nearer to
us, we saw them kneel down, crying aloud
to us, that we would be pleas'd to give them
our Blessing, for they had perceiv'd by our
Habit that we were Priests; we immediately
dispatch'd them a great Sign of the Cross,
whereupon they return'd to their Labour. Be∣ing
gone a little further, we saw many others
come, who desir'd the same favour. Some
of them approach'd nearer to us, and endea∣vour'd
to kiss our Boots, or touch our Habits
with their Hands, and afterwards kiss'd the
parts of their Hands wherewith they had
touch'd them. We were not much in Love
with these kind of Ceremonies, as having
the <HI>Banditi</HI> always in our minds. However,
we began at last to be accustom'd to it, and
admir'd the Superstition and simplicity of
these poor People, whom their Priests have
well nigh persuaded to adore them.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="111"/>
I have already in several Places made
mention of the Superstition of the <HI>Italians;</HI> but
there is none to be compar'd with that,
which Reigns in the Parts, that are subject
to the Dominion of <HI>Spain.</HI> And I suppose
the reason why the Priests command more
respect there is, because by their frequent
Conversing with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they have ac∣custom'd
themselves to an air of Gravity,
that makes them very Venerable, and have
taken to themselves Proud and Lofty Titles,
affecting to be call'd Gentlemen and Knights
of Jesus Christ, which probably may contri∣bute
much to impress this great respect upon
the Spirits of the common People.</P>
<P>Generally throughout all <HI>Italy,</HI> the Priests
are Masters, and consequently are Fear'd, but
(setting aside their Character, which they
have a respect for,) not esteem'd or respected.
Yea, there are some Parts of <HI>Italy,</HI> where they
have scarcely any respect shew'd them at all.
The <HI>Venetians</HI> make a distinction between a
Priest at the Altar, Array'd in his Pontifical
Habit, when he saith, or is about to say Mass;
and a Priest in Worldly Commerce and Con∣verse.
Under the first Consideration, they
bestow the same Adorations upon him, as up∣on
Jesus Christ, whose Person, they say, he
Represents; they approach them to touch
and kiss their Habit, or their Footsteps, as
they return from the Altar, and fall upon
their Knees to receive their Benediction. But
<PB N="197" REF="111"/>
as soon as they have undrest themselves, and
are come out of the Vestry, they do not so
much as Salute them, or give them the least
Preference. The most part of the Nobility
of <HI>Venice,</HI> have a Priest in their Houses, for
their Chaplains, or to be the Governours of
their Children; but they use them with the
greatest Indignity, they make them to Dine
with their Servants, and use them as such;
for they Command them as the meanest Ser∣vant,
and make them run up and down on
Errands like Foot-Boys; with a Come hither
Priest, Go thither Priest; indeed it is a very
shame, to see how they talk to their Priests;
and they have certainly more respect for their
Gondoliers or Bargemen, than for them.
When a Priest accompanies the Children,
whose Governour he is, along the Streets,
they will not suffer him to go besides with
them, but will have them follow them, as
their Lackey; and if the Children go to Vi∣sit
some other Noble <HI>Venetian,</HI> they are call'd
to come up, to the Dining Room, and the
poor Priest must stay below at the Gate with
the Servants. And in truth, they make use
of them purely for Foot-Boys; for if they
had no Priests to accompany their Children,
they would be oblig'd to keep Foot-Boys, or
some Servants or other to do it, and yet they
give them no Salary neither. 'Tis the Priest
that costs them less than any other of their
Domesticks, for he has never a Farthing of Wa∣ges,
<PB N="198" REF="112"/>
and for his Diet, he is fain to take it
with the Servants, and Gondoliers, as was
mention'd before. All the advantage he has,
is this, that they give him leave every Mor∣ning,
to go and say Mass in some Church or
other, and the Mony he gains thereby, is for
himself, and serves to maintain him in Clothes.
But as much as the Priests are kept under, and
undervalu'd in outward Converse amongst the
<HI>Venetians,</HI> so much are they Honour'd and
Respected in the Kingdom of <HI>Naples;</HI> the
Title of <HI>Cavalier di Christo,</HI> Knight of Christ,
gives them entrance to, and acceptance with
the best of Companies, and amongst the
greatest Lords. Not only at the Altar, but
wheresoever they meet them, they account
it, not only Honourable, but Meritorious, to
touch and kiss their Cassocks, as those poor
Country Men did, who quitted their Plows,
and came a great way to kiss our Boots.</P>
<P>We came to <HI>Mola,</HI> which is a small Town
upon the Sea Shoar, and from whence we
may see <HI>Gaeta.</HI> I will not insist here to give
you a Relation of <HI>Cicero's</HI> Gardens, of the
<HI>Via Appia,</HI> or of those other Curiosities which
we meet with in these Quarters, and whereof
the World is sufficiently inform'd, by those
many Books of Travels, that have handled
them on purpose, and also because it condu∣ceth
nothing to my present Design. I shall
only here present you with a pretty odd Spe∣ctacle
which presented it self to our Eyes at
<PB N="199" REF="112"/>
<HI>Mola.</HI> We saw a <HI>Spanish</HI> Souldier, who had
a great Purse in his Hand, and a Priest that
followed him, they went from House to
House, and from Shop to Shop. The Soul∣dier
accosted us in a manner, very Cavalier
like, and which spoke him to be what he was.
Gentlemen, said he, put some pieces of Mony
into my Purse, that this Knight of Christ here
may say Mass. My Companion gave him
somewhat a rude Answer. How so, said he,
do I hinder him from saying Mass? It is not
enough, repli'd the Souldier, that you do not
hinder him, you must help and assist him;
and taking him by his Cloak, he said, assure
your self, that I will not let you go, till you
have given me something; so that he was fain
to put his Hand into his Pocket and content
him. The Priest who was likewise a <HI>Spaniard,</HI>
kept himself always behind the Souldier, with
his great flat Hat upon his Head, and with all
the Gravity of a Prelate, he neither looked
upon, nor Saluted any one, but March'd
along continually muttering in his Breviary:
Which made my Companion, after that he
had put some Mony into the Purse, to say,
methinks he might at least thank those, that
give something. But the Souldier, answered
for him; What? would you have him to
take notice of Men, whilst he is speaking to
God? The answer I confess was excellent for
a Souldier: Tho' indeed it was but too evi∣dent,
that it was nothing but Pride, which
<PB N="200" REF="113"/>
put this Priest upon saying his Office, after
this manner publickly in the Streets, as if he
could not have found any other place or time
for the performance of that Duty. But I
have observ'd, that the most part of the
Clergy of <HI>Rome,</HI> seldom put themselves upon
saying their Office, but when and where they
may be seen. There are some of them, who
make themselves insupportable, and who to
exempt themselves from the Duties of Civil
Society, betake themselves to their Breviary,
when any one stands in need of them. One
might well tell them, what an honest Man,
who had business at <HI>Rome,</HI> spoke upon occa∣sion
of an Ecclesiastical Judge, before whom
his Cause was to be Pleaded. Every time he
went to speak with him, this Judge, who
had already been Brib'd by his Adverse Party,
to avoid the Hearing of his Reasons, took
upon him always to Read his Breviary, when
ever he came to speak with him, and his Ser∣vants
gave him no other answer, but this,
that their Master was saying his Office: <HI>Dice
al suo Officio.</HI> At last this Honest Man being
weary of hearing continually the same an∣swer,
told them: <HI>Dice l' Officio? quanto
Sarebbe meglio che lo facesse. Saith his Office:</HI>
(quoth he?) <HI>How much better would it be
to do it?</HI> In like manner this <HI>Spanish</HI> Priest
would, as it seems to me have done much
better, either to have taken his time early
in the Morning, to have said his Breviary
<PB N="201" REF="113"/>
or to have deferr'd it to some other time more
convenient, that he might have been in a
condition to have thank'd the Persons, that
bestow'd their Charity upon him?</P>
<P>They told us, That the Souldiers in those
Parts did render this kind Office to all poor
Stranger Priests, who could not meet with any
that would pay them for their Mass, to excuse
them from the trouble of Begging themselves.
As for the other Priests of the Country, they
are sure to meet with their Pay in their
Churches. These Souldiers sometimes gather
a great deal more, than is necessary for to say
a Mass; but for all that, they very honestly
give all to the poor Priests, for whom they
have Collected it, without being willing to re∣ceive
one Farthing of it for their pains, not∣withstanding
that frequently they are a Com∣pany
of miserable Wretches, that are ready to
starve; in which case I have often admired
their extraordinary Piety, in point-blank con∣tradiction
to the common Proverb; <HI>Nulla Fides
Pietasque viris qui castra sequuntur.</HI> They are
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Souldiers who do this, and not the
<HI>Italian,</HI> nor the Natives of the Kingdom of
<HI>Naples.</HI></P>
<P>After having refresh'd our selves at <HI>Mola,</HI>
we went to <HI>Caieta,</HI> which lies on one side of it,
and from thence went on Foot, to take a view
of the Rock, which they say was rent asunder
at the Death of our Saviour, when the Rocks
were cleft, and the Graves were opened.
<PB N="202" REF="114"/>
We ascended, winding round the Mountain,
which is on the backside of <HI>Caieta;</HI> and indeed
a part of the City is built upon the Side, of
that height, where it forms a fair Amphi∣theater.
They have taken care to make the
Way, that leads up to the Cleft of the Rock,
very easie; I can't well say, whether it was
half a mile, or a quarter of a mile that we
mounted; but we had no reason to repent of
the Pains we had taken, for certainly it is one
of the most Lovely Places, and greatest Curio∣sities
that can be seen. This Rock forms a
Cape, which runs out a great way into the Sea,
and is split from the Top to the Bottom by the
midst, and the two halves of the Rock are
distant from each other the length of about a
Perch, or a Perch and an half. Being on the
Top, we see the Waves of the Sea that pass
under the Rock, and beating against the Stones
make a dreadful Noise. A great Stone being
loosned from the upper part of the Rock, fell
down with that exactness, that it stuck fast
between the Cleft in the lowermost part of it,
which is pretty near the Water, and it was
found large enough, and firmly fix'd to build
a Chapel upon it. The Papists make a Mi∣racle
of this, and tell us, <HI>That a Holy Hermit,
who dwelt upon this Mountain, and who almost
continually meditated upon the Passion of our Sa∣viour,
near to the Cleft of the Rock, pray'd on a
time very earnestly to God, That it would please
him so to dispose of things, that a Chapel might
<PB N="203" REF="114"/>
be built in this place, which had exprest some kind of
Sensibility at the Sufferings of his Son, our Lord
Jesus Christ; and at the same instant, by the
Divine Power, this Stone was loosned from its
place, and fell down and fixed it self in the place,
where he had desired to have a Chapel.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks have been so often
convinc'd of Falseness, in regard of the Mi∣racles
they attribute to themselves, that we have
reason to doubt of all those they have a mind
to make us believe. This Stone, and this
Chapel, in the condition they are at present,
shew nothing that looks Miraculous; both the
one and the other rest upon very good Foun∣dations;
and if a Miracle was wrought in
loosning it from the rest of the Rock, and
placing it where it is, this is that which is in
question; and as we cannot prove the con∣trary,
so neither can they, what they assert.
The Matter of certain Truth is only this, That
there is a Chapel there, and a very fair de∣scent
leading to it. If Men feel Devotion,
when they go down thither meditating on the
Passion of our Saviour, as a certain Traveller
in the Relation he has given us of his Travels
doth assure us, it is the Meditation it self that
will afford and excite that at all times, and in
all places, where it is done with a well-prepared
Heart and Mind. The Chapel is spacious
enough, and very neat, and there are Windows
that look out on both sides, by which one may
take a view of this great Cleft very exactly;
<PB N="204" REF="115"/>
and certainly, it is a Sight that frights Nature,
especially when one looks down into the Sea.
Whilst we were here we saw a Sea-Monster,
which, as it were in a moment, plung'd it
self again into the Sea, not giving me leave to
view it so well, as to give you a description of
it. The Popes have granted Indulgences to
those who go and visit this Place; and at cer∣tain
times of the Year, more especially in <HI>Lent,</HI>
they come in Pilgrimage thither from all
Parts.</P>
<P><HI>After that we had satisfied our Curiosity, we
remounted again by the same Steps, and we
went to see some Hermits, who abide upon
the Mountain, and are Lodged very neatly.
The Gentleman that Travell'd with me, ha∣ving
presented them with a Paper of</HI> Bononia
<HI>Snush-Tobacco, which without doubt is one of
the greatest Presents that can be made to</HI> Italians;
<HI>they Invited us to stay and Dine with them, and
seeing that they were well provided with Flesh
and Fish, we accepted the Invitation. They
told us,</HI> That tho' they were poor, and lived only
upon Alms, yet, blessed be God, they wanted nothing.
<HI>There was one of these Hermits that was a
Priest, and who went every day to say Mass
in the Miraculous Chapel. Those of them
that are Priests, they call</HI> Fathers, <HI>and those
that are not,</HI> Brothers. <HI>The Father Hermit kept
Company with us, to entertain us with Dis∣course,
whilst the Brothers gave Order about
Dinner. He told us,</HI> That he had not been an
<PB N="205" REF="115"/>
Hermit above Three years, and that he was a
Secular Priest before he turn'd Hermit: That the
Hermit, his Predecessor died very Aged, and with
an odour of Sanctity; but that about a year after
his Death, they had found a great deal of Silver
hid in an Old Pallet-Bed, on which he lay, tho'
it was not permitted to them to possess one Far∣thing,
and that this had much lessened the good
Opinion they had conceived of him, neither was it
known how possibly he could gather all that Mony.
<HI>This Hermit entertain'd us with good and
witty Discourse, and had seen the World in
his time. He had Travell'd in</HI> France <HI>and</HI>
Germany, <HI>before that he was an Hermit. He
seem'd to be of a plain, open, and free Spirit,
and quite different from the ordinary Temper
of the Monks and</HI> Frati <HI>of</HI> Italy; <HI>whence the</HI>
Capucins <HI>also had taken occasion to Accuse him
before the Bishop of</HI> Caieta, <HI>that he was not of
an Hermetick Spirit, with intent of thrusting
him out of that Place, and putting in them∣selves,
but fail'd of their design. I formerly
was not unacquainted of the</HI> Capucins, <HI>being
irreconcilable Enemies to the</HI> Hermits, <HI>because
of the resemblance of their Habits, and of
their same way of Subsistence, which is Alms;</HI>
Figulus odit Figulum; Two of a Trade seldom
love one another. <HI>But this Hermit, it seems,
had kept his Station in spite of all their Efforts,
and had so far gain'd the Spirit of the Poor by
his Alms, of the Common People by his Fami∣liarity,
and that of the Great Ones by his
<PB N="206" REF="116"/>
unaffected Air, and pleasant Comportment,
that they despair'd of ever gaining their End
upon him. He told me,</HI> That they gave Meat
every Day to above Forty poor People. <HI>I desired
him to tell me, how it was possible for them to
do so, since they liv'd upon nothing but Cha∣rity
themselves? He reply'd,</HI> That they had
mnch more bestowed upon them than they could
spend; that every Morning they had two Asses sent
to them loaden with Provisions, and that besides
this, he went every Evening to demand a Charity
at all the Gentlemens Houses where he was known;
that when he came there, they led him into their
Cellars where their best Wine was, and afterwards
into their Butteries, saying to him, <HI>Hermit, if there
be any thing here you like, pray take what
pleaseth you best.</HI> Here it is <HI>(said he)</HI> that I and my
Companion do fill our Knapsacks. When we have a
mind to have some Fish, we go in the Evening to the
Haven where the Fisher-Boats come, and they give
us abundantly, and that too which is very good, as
you will find by what you shall have for your
Dinner. But on the other hand, also these Persons
some time or other return the Visit to us, and we
entertain them with the Best that we have. We
are not at all Covetous of that which cost us
nothing, and indeed this is the way for us to have
still more; for, by this means, these Persons do not
know how to make us good Chear enough when
we come to them again. The <HI>Capucins (said he)</HI>
do not take this method, they are insatiable, and
have a Temporal Father (as they call him) to
<PB N="207" REF="116"/>
whom they send the Surplus of their Alms, and who
turns it into Mony, to Buy for them whatsoever
they desire. They touch no Mony, nor buy any
thing; but he toucheth it, and buys it for them.
If they give some bits of Bread to the Poor at
their Gate, they are only some Scraps of the
Brownest, which they could not sell. But as for us,
we bestow upon them indifferently of all we have;
this is that which hath procur'd us the Affection
of the Poor, and to that degree, that they would
certainly sacrifice their Lives for us, rather than
to suffer the Hermitage to be taken out of our
hands.</P>
<P>This good Hermit, after having discours'd
thus a good while against the <HI>Capucins,</HI> order'd
Dinner to be brought up, which indeed was
Order'd and Drest very handsomly, tho' in
Wooden Dishes. My Companion would eat
no Pottage, because they had no other, but
Wooden Spoons. This made the Hermits to
laugh heartily. They asked one another, where
they might get a Silver Spoon for this Gentle∣man?
This was a young Priest, who never
had Travell'd, and who had always been
brought up in his Father's House: But at last,
seeing that the Pulse look'd very well, he ven∣tur'd
to taste of them, and finding them ex∣treamly
well drest and season'd, <HI>Well,</HI> (said he)
<HI>I don't matter a Spoon now, I shall make a shift
good enough, to eat them with my Fingers.</HI> The
<HI>Hermits</HI> and <HI>Capucins</HI> have the gift of Dres∣sing
Meat perfectly well, and it seems, as if
<PB N="208" REF="117"/>
they made it part of their Study: Neither
would I have any one to take an estimate of
their Mortification by their Wooden Spoons,
but by that which is in them. The Father
Hermit drank to us in most excellent Wine,
tho' out of a Wooden Cup: And for his part,
was not slack to encourage us to eat and drink
by his good Example. <HI>I am no Hypocrite</HI> (said
he) <HI>as many Hermits are. When one comes to
Visit them, they will tell you, They have not eat of
Four days, and that they are yet Fasting: For my
part, to tell you Truth, I eat but Four times a day,
and do not think, that Holiness consists in not Eat∣ing,
but in Eating well, (that is, with giving
Thanks) except only on Fast-Days, enjoyned by the
Holy Church.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I seeing that our Father Hermit was in a
good humour, desired him to tell me his Opi∣nion
concerning the Miraculous Chapel.</HI>
Alas, <HI>(said he)</HI> I was not there when the Mi∣racle
was done; but if God was pleased to work
one for the Founding of it, we have need he should
work another now, for the preserving of it; for
ever and anon Stones fall down from the Rock,
and much endamage the Roof of it; so that all
the Mony of the Pilgrims is scarcely sufficient to
Repair it continually: But as for the Miracles
which are wrought in the Chapel, tho' they say
that a great many happen there every Day, we
never saw so much as One only. Yea, what is
more yet, about Thirty or Forty Miles from hence,
you shall hear them talk of Miracles, which they
<PB N="209" REF="117"/>
say have been wrought here, that we our selves
never heard of before. I suppose them to be some
Beggars, who pass this way, and who go after∣wards
into the Villages, and report there, that
they have been miraculously healed of their Infir∣mities,
to induce People to give more liberal Alms
to them. <HI>This Hermit exprest a great Air of
sincerity in all that he said, which gave me
indeed a great esteem for his Person; for ma∣ny
others of his Coat, are so far from owning
any such thing, that they would rather have
been of the Humour to exaggerate all such
Reports, and been ready to invent a thousand
Falsities to raise the Credit of the place of
their Devotion. After Dinner the Hermit
had no leisure to Discourse us any longer, by
reason of the great Numbers of Poor, that
waited at the Gate for his Charity. We
therefore took our leaves of him, after that
we had thanked him for his Civility and
his good Dinner, and so return'd to</HI> Cajeta.</P>
<P>Seeing that an occasion has been here pre∣sented
me to speak of these Hermits, and
that this hath brought to my remembrance
many things I have observ'd in <HI>Italy</HI> concer∣ning
this kind of Life, as well as those that
profess it; I shall continue to entertain you
therewith some longer time. I was astonish'd
to see that the Eremitick State, which for∣merly
was so Flourishing in <HI>Italy,</HI> as may be
seen, by so many antient Foundations, and
Places, which are still at this day call'd Her∣mitages,
<PB N="210" REF="118"/>
(tho' no Hermites live in them) are
now fallen into so great Decadence, that
scarcely are there some few of them to be
found here and there. In S. <HI>Bennet</HI>'s time,
<HI>Italy</HI> was full of Hermitages, and he himself
profest an Hermetick Life, before the Mo∣nastick.
At that time there were Men of Lear∣ning
and Piety, who retir'd into Hermita∣ges,
to have the better opportunity, by being
separated from the World, of applying them∣selves,
more entirely to Study and Contem∣plation;
whereas the present Hermites are no
other, but a company of miserable Wretches,
of the Sink of the common People, who
have neither Learning nor Parts, and where∣of
the greater part lead a very disorderly and
scandalous Life. The reason whereof is, because
the Monks, being in process of time become
very Powerful, have possest themselves of all
the best Hermitages, that were endow'd with
standing Revenues, and made Priories of them,
which they Incorporated with their Abbeys;
and the Mendicant Orders gleaning after
them, took Possession of well nigh all those
which were near to Cities, or great Bur∣roughs,
and there built their Convents: So
that there are none remaining now, but some
in Solitary and far distant Places, and a very
few, that are near to Cities. The Hermites
that are the Inhabitants of these latter Her∣mitages,
have enough to do, to defend them∣selves
against the <HI>Capucins</HI> and other <HI>Mandi∣cants,</HI>
<PB N="211" REF="118"/>
who endeavour to supplant, or at least
to decry them, and bring them into Disre∣pute.
Those who live in solitary and far
distant Places are much suspected, because
there have been frequently found amongst
them some that were the greatest Villains
imaginable, who Murther'd all those that
came to Visit their Hermitages, and Robb'd
upon the High-way. This is the reason why
Honest Men do not care to make their Re∣treat
in any of those Places. Wherefore com∣monly
they are none but poor Men, that
make themselves Hermites, in hopes, that in
favour of that Habit, they may find a Sub∣sistence
from the Liberality of some of the
good Country Folks, if they can but once
get the knack of dexterously Playing the Hy∣pocrites.</P>
<P>I shall here relate to you a deceit that I
my self discover'd, of two <HI>French</HI> Hermites,
who lived on one of the Hermitages, which
are on the Mountain call'd S. <HI>Sylvester,</HI> about
a days Journy from <HI>Rome,</HI> but by another
Name, Mount <HI>Soracte.</HI> I was gon from
<HI>Rome</HI> with an intent to take a View of the
Country, which they call <HI>la Sabine,</HI> which is
not above three or four days Journy from
thence, being Famous for having once been
the abode of the ancient <HI>Sabini,</HI> who signa∣liz'd
themselves by so many brave Exploits
against the <HI>Romans.</HI> I took up my Lodging,
the first Night, in a Village, which is near to
<PB N="212" REF="119"/>
the Mount S. <HI>Sylvester,</HI> and the next Mor∣ning
the curiosity took me to endeavour to
get up to it. They told me, there was but
one only Path-way to get up to it, which was
on the other side of the Mountain, so that
I had a great way to go about to get thither:
Wherefore viewing well the Top of the
Mountain, it appear'd to me, that I might
very well save my self the trouble of going
that great way about, in mounting by a cer∣tain
passage, which seem'd to me as if it had
been a troden Path, and the Stones that were
above it, appear'd to me like Steps, by which
one might get up to the Top. Wherefore
without any further consideration, I put my
self forward to make an assault upon this
high Mountain. I scarcely was got up the
one half of this way, but I found I was ex∣treamly
mistaken in my account, and that
those Stones which had appear'd to me so
little, and by which it seem'd I might easily
gain the Top of the Mountain, were indeed
no other than great Rocks heap'd upon one
another, which made the Top of the Moun∣tain
in accessible. However, I continu'd still
to ascend, rather for my Recreation, and to
see how far I could get, than in any hopes of
compassing my first design, the execution
whereof did then seem to me impossible. I
mounted, I clambred, I crept, into the Clefts
of the Rocks, and by the help of certain Roots
of Trees, I raised my self up to some great
<PB N="213" REF="119"/>
Rocks, whence I perceiv'd that I was come
near to the Top. This added new Spirits to
me, and so much the more Courage, because
I saw there would be more danger, in at∣tempting
to get down again, to the place
from whence I was mounted, than to get up
to the very Top. Accordingly I prosecuted
my intent, and being come up higher, I was
extreamly astonish'd, to find amongst the
Stones, great Pieces of brown Bread, and in
very great quantity, some of them being
Mouldy and quite Rotten, and others yet
very fresh.</P>
<P>At last after some new and last Efforts,
which I would not now begin again, I found
my self all on a suddain in a very fine Gar∣den,
which was Enclos'd on all sides with
very high Walls, except only on that side
where it was thought in accessible. This was
the Garden belonging to one of the Hermi∣tages;
and I descri'd in it two Hermits,
who were taking their Recreation in a Bower,
shaded with pleasant Green-Trees. These
Hermits were sorely affrighted at me, and
taking me for some Ghost, betook themselves
to their Heels, and being got into their Her∣mitage,
they Barricado'd it against me. I was
quite spent with the extream pains I had taken,
out of Breath, and in a great Sweat; so I
went to rest my self in the Bower they had
left, to see whether I could retrieve my Spirits
again. I found here, the remains of a great
<PB N="214" REF="120"/>
Pasty, and of a large Bottle of Wine; and
upon a Bench, on the other side of me a Fan
and a Coiff. The Hermites at last being re∣cover'd
a little of their Fright, ventur'd again
into the Garden, and came to accost me.
They were astonish'd to hear, that I had made
a shift to get up by the Rocks. I soon dis∣cover'd
them to be <HI>French</HI> Men, and they told
me, that it was about two years, since they
had begun to live in that Hermitage: I spoke
to them concerning the Pieces of brown Bread
that I had found, and I took notice that this
brought a fresh Colour into their Faces; and
forasmuch as they perceiv'd that I had taken
notice of the Gloves, Coif, and Fan, that
were left in the Bower, one of them took the
Word, and told me, <HI>Sir, as you are a</HI> French-<HI>Man,
we hope that you will have the goodness,
not to do us any Prejudice. We will hide nothing
from you, but sincerely Confess that it is we, that
have thrown away these bits of Bread, in the
place where you met with them; for we never
had the design of being good Hermites; we have
always been Souldiers by Profession, before that
we took this Habit upon us. It was a</HI> French
<HI>Hermit, a great Runner of the Countries, and who
made a shift to live very well in</HI> Italy, <HI>that per∣suaded
us to do as much, and to follow the same
Course, and procured the Habit of Hermits for us
at</HI> Rome: <HI>and having some time after found
this Hermitage Vacant, we retired thither, and
we have lived here, as other Hermits do, on the
<PB N="215" REF="120"/>
Alms we beg in the Neighbouring Villages. We at
first refused to change our brown Bread for other
Necessaries, amongst the poor Peasants; but when
this came to the knowledge of many Persons, it
was a great prejudice to us, in our Quests, and
they began to reproach us for dainty Persons, that
could eat no Brown Bread; wherefore we now
rather chuse to cast it to the Crows, than either to
sell or give it away. And thus much for the Pieces
of Bread you met with. But seeing you have cast
your Eyes upon some Female Ornaments, that are
left here with us, we shall tell you the Mystery
of them also, in order to desire you, to give us
your Advice, in a business that extreamly perplex∣eth
me and my Companion.</HI></P>
<P>In the next Hermitage which is joyned to ours,
there lives an <HI>Italian</HI> Hermit of a very bad
Life, tho' he be not known for such. He hath de∣bauched
a Roman Gentlewoman, whom he has
kept with him, for some Months; and seeing he
had no prospect of keeping her with him long, but
that we must discover, because we have some
Windows that look out, towards his Hermitage,
and that we go daily to Visit him, with a great
deal of Freedom; he rather chose to Communi∣cate
the Matter to us, than to endeavour to con∣ceal
it. He hath made a hole in the Wall of our
Garden, by which his Lady, in case of sudden
Surprize, or of any one coming to Visit him, might
retire her self into our Hermitage. For the rest,
we have nothing but the sight of her; for he is
so extreamly Jealous, that he keeps her all the
<PB N="216" REF="121"/>
day shut up in a Hole, that differs nothing from
a Prison; and when at any time he brings her to
take a Walk, he continues all the while with her.
And it seems she does not think much of it neither,
for she loves him extreamly. 'Tis she that fur∣nisheth
all manner of Expences; for she hath
brought abundance of Gold and Silver along with
her from <HI>Rome.</HI> And to speak the Truth, we
have found our selves very well, since the Her∣mit
has Discover'd all to us; for there is not a
day passeth over our Heads, in which we do not
receive some Present or other from them. He
came and gave us a Visit this Morning, with his
Lady, and they brought with them the Pasty and
Bottle you have seen; it is not much above a quar∣ter
of an hour since they are gone, and it seems
the Gentlewoman forgot to take her Fan and Gloves
with her. It was great good luck for you Sir,
that you did not come whilst he was here, for he
would certainly have kill'd you, for fear of being
Discovered. He carries always a great Dagger
under his Gown, to make use of it upon occasion:
Neither would we advise you, to stay here any con∣siderable
time, for should he return hither, as some∣times
he does, and as in all likelyhood he will, to
fetch the things his Lady has left behind her, you
would be in great Danger. We only desire you
would be pleased to assist us with your Counsel,
how we might best discover this, without doing
our selves a Mischief. I told them that the
most safe, and short way was to acquaint the
Cardinal Vicar, and that they needed not to trou∣ble
<PB N="217" REF="121"/>
themselves any further: And that as for my part,
I knew not, whether I should return to <HI>Rome</HI> or
no. They told me that this Hermit was so cunning,
that now for some time they had not durst so much
as to take one step towards <HI>Rome;</HI> so narrowly
did he watch them.</P>
<P>I had been told, that there was a very fair
Abby of <HI>Bernardines</HI> upon the same Mountain,
and therefore I asked the Hermits, why they
did not discover the matter to the Abbot; but
they repli'd, that they knew they would not
be welcome there with such a Story, because all
the Monks there led a very dissolute Life, and
had all of them their Mistresses, as well as the
Hermit. Moreover they told me, that they sus∣pected
the Hermit to be a Sorcerer, which
made them the more fearful, to make the least
step towards the discovering of him. That
they were of opinion also, that he had be∣witch'd
this Gentlewoman, because that tho'
he had no considerable Qualities, and was be∣sides
very deform'd in Body, with a great
slovenly Beard, a stinking Breath, and rotten
Teeth, yet that she had always loved him
Passionately, from the time that she had first
receiv'd one of his Letters, wherein was en∣closed
a Piece of white-Wax, like unto an
<HI>Agnus Dei.</HI> That they had also frequently
had cause to admire his knowledge of many
secret things, that had hapned at very far
distant Places, all which gave them great sus∣picion,
that he had to do with the Devil.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="122"/>
They were about to tell me more of him;
but the fear into which they had put me,
lest this Venerable Hermit might return to
give me a Visit, made me, after that in a few
words I had exhorted them not to follow such
wicked Examples, and to have the Fear of
God before their Eyes, to take my leave of
them, desiring them to shew me the way to the
Abby of the Fathers, where I intended to go
and say Mass, having made a Vow to do so,
at the Altar of S. <HI>Sylvester,</HI> when in clam∣bring
the Rocks, I found my self in great dan∣ger
of my Life. This was also the reason
why I refus'd to Eat or Drink with these Her∣mits,
because no Man may say Mass except
he be Fasting. So I went a little higher up
the Mountain, by a very pleasant way, and
I Arriv'd at the Abby, just at Dinner time.
I had much ado to get the Church Door
open'd for me, in order to acquit my self of
my Vow. After I had said Mass, I desir'd
them to let me see the Monastery; but they
made great difficulty also to grant me this
Request; because the Monks, according to the
Custom of <HI>Italy,</HI> were almost all of them gone
to take their rest. However at last one of the
Monks, by order of the Prior, led me into
a small Garden, which he told me was the
place, whither S. <HI>Sylvester</HI> retir'd himself, du∣ring
the Persecution, which afflicted the
Church in his time, and that there he wrought
that great Miracle, whereof mention is made
<PB N="219" REF="122"/>
in his Life time, <HI>viz.</HI> that some of the Em∣perours
Men being come to look for him, the
Saint had a desire to entertain them; but
having nothing wherewith, he sent a Deacon
that serv'd him, to Sow some Carots in the
Garden; and having about an Hour after or∣der'd
some of them to be taken up for Din∣ner,
his Men went in a way of Mockery and
Derision to him, but were extreamly surpriz'd,
when being come at the place where the Carot
Seed had been Sow'd, they found very fair
and large Carots, of an admirable good taste,
and which serv'd for a Dinner to his Guests.
The Monk told me, that this Miracle had
in some sort been continu'd ever since; for
that the Carots, that were Sown in that Gar∣den,
retain an extraordinary pleasant taste.
Upon his telling of me so, I made bold, to
pluck up one of them out of the Ground, and
having scrap'd it with my Knife, I tasted of
it, by way of Devotion; but found it of a very
flat taste: I threw it away; Hold Sir, said the
Religious, they are not to be Eaten so, they
must be Boyl'd, and drest with good Oil, or
good Butter, and good Spices. We have a
Cook that knows how to dress them admi∣rably
well. You put so many good things
to them, my good Father, said I, smiling, that
at last you make them, if not miraculously,
at least admirably good. This Religious, after
having shew'd me the Garden only, had the
Civility, according to the Order he had re∣ceived,
<PB N="220" REF="123"/>
to lead me to a Chamber where I was
to Dine: They brought me a Dish with Fish,
and another with some of those Holy Roots,
which indeed were extreamly well drest.</P>
<P>After Dinner I apply'd my self to take a
view of the Top of Mount <HI>Soraéle,</HI> from
whence certainly there is the best Prospect
that can be, the whole Country about <HI>Rome</HI>
lying open to it, together with that Proud
City, in its whole extent. This Mountain
stands single, and is not joyned to any other,
having on all sides of it most rich and fertil
Plains, that surround it, and being very
high and steep on all sides with great white
Rocks, one would take it, at a distance, for
some very high Steeple, having its Top in the
Clouds; and more especially in the Winter
time, when the Snow covers some little Shrubs
of Trees, which have their Roots in the Rocks,
whereof <HI>Horace</HI> makes mention in one of his
Odes;
<Q><L>Cernis ut altâ stet Nive candidum</L>
<L>Soracte—</L></Q></P>
<P>I came down the Mountain by a much
more pleasant and easie Way, than that by
which I went up to it. In my way I met
with the Old Hermit, of whom I made men∣tion
before, who return'd from saying Mass
in a Village at the Foot of the Mountain.
He enquir'd of me, Whether I had been to
<PB N="221" REF="123"/>
Visit the Hermitages, or the Abby? I told
him, that I came from the Holy Places, which
S. <HI>Sylvester</HI> had sanctified by his Retirement.
<HI>God be praised for it, Sir,</HI> (said he) <HI>it is very well
done of you. This is the good Pattern which the
other Hermits of this Mountain, and I my self, have
propounded to our selves to imitate; and, to speak
truth, he pours forth abundance of Graces upon
those who are devoted to him, and put their Trust
in him. It is now One and Twenty years, I have
had the Honour of wearing the Sacred Habit you
see upon me; and the further I proceed, the more
pleasure and satisfaction do I find in the Ways of
the Lord.</HI> To hear him Talk, one would have
taken him for another S. <HI>Paul</HI> of <HI>Thebes,</HI> who
was the first Hermit. But for all his fine Talk,
I took care to keep my self at a certain
distance from him, that his great Dagger
might not reach me, in case he had gon about
to make use of it. But at last, he bid me Fare∣well,
wishing me a Thousand Blessings. He
held a great <HI>Bead-row,</HI> or <HI>Pater-noster</HI> of Wood
in his Hand, the Beads whereof were as big
as a Nut, and he had a Cross fastned to his
Girdle, with many great Medals, which made
a great Noise as he went, by striking one
against the other; he leaned upon his Staff,
and in all points acted the Hypocrit to admi∣ration.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="124"/>
The Eremitical Habit is of a brown Tawny
Colour, consisting of a short Tunicle, reaching
a little lower than the mid-Leg; they have a
great Cowl upon their Head of a Pyramidal
Figure, and a little Mantle about their Should∣ers,
not much unlike to that of the <HI>Capucins.</HI>
These kind of Antick Habits seem to have
been contriv'd for no other end, but to make
terrible impressions on the Senses, the better
to dispose the Minds of Men to conceive a
great esteem and veneration for those that wear
them. He that should go about to vilifie or
undervalue this external Garb in the presence
of a Papist, had almost as good profane what∣soever
is most Holy in his Religion; as if for∣sooth
there could be no wicked Men in the
garb of Satyrs. I met with my two <HI>French</HI>
Hermits some time after at <HI>Venice;</HI> who told
me, <HI>They had accused the Old Hermit, but he
having very dexterously slipt away his Lady, denied
all, and made these Poor Men to pass for Slan∣derers;
to that degree had he Charmed the People
by his Hypocrisie. Whereupon they had been forced
to quit their Hermitages, and were then going for</HI>
Hungary, <HI>to take upon them the Habit of Souldiers,
which</HI> (they said) <HI>was every whit as Holy, as that
of a Hermit.</HI></P>
<P>I have since this, in my Travels, seen many
fair Hermitages, more particularly on the
<HI>Apennine,</HI> which are those Mountains that
divide all <HI>Italy</HI> in the length of it. I have
had occasion to pass and repass them several
<PB N="223" REF="124"/>
times, in various parts of them, where are to
be seen wonderful places in the Woods, and
upon the very points of Rocks, which they
told me were Hermitages. But since the time
I knew, that the most of those that dwelt in
them were only a Company of base Fellows,
I took care not to Visit them. Many of these
wretched Hermits have been publickly Exe∣cuted
from time to time, for committing the
most enormous Crimes. There was one of
them taken at <HI>Venice,</HI> who confessed at his
Death, that he had killed above Threescore
Persons, as well Men as Women. He had his
Hermitage between <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Buran,</HI> in a
little Island of about Two hundred Paces in
Circuit, where is still to be seen the Ruins of
his Hermitage, which they demolished. This
wretched Person went by Night to Sea in a
Disguise, and Masked, accompanied with three
or four Robbers, to whom his Hermitage
serv'd for a Retreat: They went and stopt the
<HI>Gondola's</HI> or small Boats that past through the
Channels, and murther'd those that refused to
surrender their Purses. There had been Re∣ports
abroad, for a considerable time, of great
Robberies and Murthers, that were com∣mitted
about this Hermitage; but who could
ever have believ'd, that a Person wearing so
holy a Habit, and so venerable a Beard, had
been the Head and Captain of these Mur∣therers?
He was at last discovered by the
Sons of a Rich Merchant of <HI>Venice;</HI> their
<PB N="224" REF="125"/>
Father, who took pleasure in the Company of
such kind of Hypocrits, went one day out of De∣votion
to Visit this Hermit, and had acquainted
his Wife and Sons with his intent. He carried
along with him some very good Provisions, to
Present him with; but this Impious Wretch
being not satisfied with that, after he had got
him to enter into his Cell, took him by the
Throat and strangled him. His Children being
astonished at their Fathers staying so long,
went with a great many of their Friends to
look for him, and entring into the Hermitage,
they found their Fathers Shoes under the Her∣mit's
Bed; whereupon they immediately seized
him, and having found the rest of his Cloaths
in an Old Cupboard, the Hermit at last shewed
them the place where he had cast his Body; it
was a great Hole, which formerly had serv'd
for a Cistern, where they found the Bodies of
above Threescore Persons, that had been sacri∣ficed
to the Fury and Avarice of this Infernal
Monster. There is also great Talk in the
Country of <HI>Ancona</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> of an Hermit, who
robb'd and murther'd the Pilgrims going to
<HI>Loretto;</HI> and of another between <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nonia</HI> and
<HI>Florence,</HI> that was no better than a Highway
Robber. These kind of Stories coming fresh
to my mind, whenever in my Travels I met
with any Hermits or Hermitages, hinder'd me
from being over-curious to Visit them.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="125"/>
I could not sufficiently lament (according
to the Principles in which I had been Educated)
that a State, which heretofore had been so
flourishing in the Church of God, and so
fruitful of Saints, was at last degenerated to
that degree, that the Hermitages were become
little else, but the Dens of Robbers and Mur∣therers.
In former times Learned Men were
seen to retire to these places, to apply them∣selves
more uninterruptedly to their Studies,
leading most vertuous and holy Lives; but at
present that Mode is quite out of date, and
a Man of Wit and Learning would be laugh'd
at, should he think of entring into this kind
of Life. But the Monasteries, on the other
hand are in more Credit and Repute than ever,
notwithstanding that the Eremitick Life hath
indeed been the Mother of the Monastick;
the first Monks have been nothing else but
Hermits, who joyned themselves together to
live in Common, and with this respect we say,
that <HI>Filia suffocavit Matrem; the Daughter hath
devoured the Mother.</HI> The Reason whereof may
easily be given: This Change did not happen
till after the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> was mounted to
that pitch of Pomp and Pride, where we find
her at present. The Head and chief Members
that govern it, have affected to make shew of
the most magnificent and luxurious Court,
that it may be is in the whole World. Now
such a Court as this cannot but stand in need
of great Incoms; and for the poor Hermits,
<PB N="226" REF="126"/>
they were the least able to contribute any
thing towards it; this is the very Reason for
which they have neglected and almost quite
abolish'd them, to make the more way for the
Monks, who have well-lin'd Purses, and who
are oblig'd from time to time, to Pay in prodi∣gious
Sums of Mony to the Apostolical Cham∣ber.</P>
<P>They are the Bishops who confer the Habit
upon Hermits within their Diocess; but at
present there are many Bishops that refuse to
admit any, and chuse rather to leave the Her∣mitages
vacant. The most part of these Her∣mits
understand no Latin, and some of them
can neither Write nor Read. How would you
have these Men spend their time in this Soli∣tude?
They become soon weary of it; and
then turn Vagabond-Hermits, that run up and
down the Country. They undertake every
Year to Visit the Holy Places; that is to say,
to go to <HI>Rome,</HI> to <HI>Loretto,</HI> to S. <HI>Anthony</HI> of <HI>Padua,</HI>
to S. <HI>Nicholas</HI> of <HI>Bar,</HI> to <HI>Mount Gargan, &amp;c.</HI>
After that they have finished their Round,
either they begin it anew, or they go and
spend the two or three remaining Winter
Months in their Hermitages. At their Return,
the good People of the Country receive them
very gladly, because they come ordinarily well
loaden with <HI>Agnus Dei's</HI> and <HI>Relicks,</HI> which
they distribute amongst them, and have al∣ways
in a readiness some pleasant Story or other
to tell them. Besides, the Monks think it be∣neath
<PB N="227" REF="126"/>
themselves, to speak to poor People;
whereas the Hermits make themselves familiar
with them. But a Man must have an Eye to
their Fingers, for they are very dextrous at
Pilfering whatsoever they can lay their Hands
upon, which afterwards they sell for Mony,
or make a Change of it in their Inns, for
good Lodging and Entertainment.</P>
<P>I hapned to be on a time at an Inn, where
some Hermits offered to sell Children Clouts and
Swadling-Bands, and desired only to have a
good Dinner in lieu of them. The Hostess
asked them, What way they had come by
them? adding, That she was astonish'd to see
them have such Gear to sell, and that she was
afraid they had stolen them. The Hermits
protested before God, they had not, but that a
Country-woman, whose Child was Dead, had
given 'em them. Whilst they were in this
Contest, the Woman of whom they had
stolen them, came to the Inn, whom the Her∣mits
no sooner saw, but they betook themselves
to their Heels, leaving the Clouts and Swadling-Bands
behind them. The Woman told us, That
whilst one of these Hermits was telling a Story,
of an Apparition of the Souls in Purgatory,
the other went forth into the Court, and took
away her Childs Clouts, which she had hung up
there to dry.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="127"/>
Notwithstanding the Heremetick State be so
extreamly corrupted and degenerated, yet the
Papists do not leave valuing themselves much
upon this account, and making a great matter
of Honour of it to themselves against the Pro∣testants,
who (say they) have declared them∣selves
profest Enemies to all these Holy States,
which, as they pretend, were the greatest Or∣nament
of the Churches of the first Ages;
and in imitation of the Life which <HI>Elias</HI> and
other of the Prophets did lead in the Deserts,
which S. <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist</HI> professed, and our
Saviour Jesus Christ himself sanctified, by his
so frequent retirings into Solitude; and of
that Life, in a word, which the first Doctors
and Fathers of the Church, as <HI>Origen,</HI> S. <HI>Hie∣rom,
&amp;c.</HI> have so highly cherished and com∣mended:
To be even with them in this, I would
demand of them, what they themselves make
of it? Who they are amongst them, that
make profession of this Excellent Life? What
Fruit it produceth? and whether it were not
much better, considering all the Disorders that
have hapned by this means, and do still daily
happen before their Eyes, wholly to cut off
from the Bosom of the Church, a sort of
Men who are become the Scandal of it, and
who having voluntarily plunged themselves
into <HI>Idleness,</HI> which is the Mother of all Vices,
have, in fine, renounced all Vertues, whether
Civil, Moral, or Christian.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="127"/>
Having thus given you some Account con∣cerning
<HI>Hermits,</HI> I cannot well avoid giving
you a Relation of some very considerable
Places, which formerly have been the Retreats
of Solitudinarians, and are now the Abode of
Monks. And forasmuch as I am here Dis∣coursing
of the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> I shall
begin with that of <HI>Sublac,</HI> which was the place
S. <HI>Bennet</HI> chose for his Retreat, when he was as
yet but a young Child.</P>
<P>In another Journy I made to <HI>Naples,</HI> finding
my self near this place, some advantageous
Accounts I had receiv'd concerning it, in∣clined
me to go and Visit it. I first Arrived
at the Burrough of <HI>Sublac,</HI> where the Monks
of S. <HI>Bennet</HI> have both Temporal and Spiritual
Jurisdiction. There is an Abby of Nuns of
the same Order; and a League further in the
same Valley, but in a part of it that is Nar∣rower,
there is a very Fair Abby of Monks,
who are very Civil to Strangers, especially to
those who come with an intent of Visiting
the Grotto of their Patriarch S. <HI>Bennet.</HI> I
met here with a Father, who was a <HI>French</HI>
Man by Nation, and to whom my Relations
in <HI>France</HI> were not unknown, who was the
cause of staying me here a whole Day; and
he himself led me to the Grotto of S. <HI>Bennet,</HI>
which is about a quarter of a League further,
in the Narrowest part of the said Valley.
The Mountains on both sides are very steep,
<PB N="230" REF="128"/>
and the Brook that runs between them takes
up well nigh the whole Space of the Valley.
However these Fathers have made a shift to
find place enough to Build here a Monastery
all in length, which can contain Fifty or
Threescore Monks, and yet it serves but for a
Lodging to Ten only, whom they call <HI>Hermits,</HI>
tho' indeed they be only so by Name, because
they live in a Community, and because they
only stay there for the space of Two Months;
after which they send Ten others thither, out
of the Neighbouring Monastery, to relieve
them. Thus they succeed by Turns to one
another. The only difference there is in their
Observance is this, That those of the Mona∣stery
where the Grotto of the Saint is, do eat
no Flesh-Meat; and in the other (as throughout
all the Order in <HI>Italy)</HI> they eat Meat Four
times a Week, notwithstanding that the use
of it be forbid them by the Rules of their
Institution, which they have Vow'd to ob∣serve.
They say, It is out of the Respect they
have to these Rules, that their Abbots have
order'd, That no Flesh should be eaten in this
Little Monastery, no more than in their Great
One of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt Cassin,</HI> that it might be true at
least▪ That the Rule of S. <HI>Bennet</HI> was observ'd
in Two of their Monasteries; which, as they
believe, is sufficient to quiet their Consciences
as to this matter. The Fathers pretend, for∣sooth,
That the Bodies of Men are much
changed in their Constitution since the time
<PB N="231" REF="128"/>
of their Legislator; and that they are not so
strong, nor consequently so able to undergo
such Rigid Observances; and indeed they
Treat all their other Rules much in the same
manner, and content themselves with the ob∣serving
of them by Turns, or by Halves.</P>
<P>In this Little Monastery, they shewed me
the Grotto of S. <HI>Bennet,</HI> upon which they
have built an Altar; and we see there also a
most curious Statue of white Marble, repre∣senting
this Saint, very young, and upon his
Knees, with a Countenance very humble and
penitent. The Habit wherewith he is repre∣sented,
serves to condemn that which the
<HI>Benedictins</HI> of <HI>Italy</HI> do wear at present; they
have so amplified and pleated it, for to make
it shew fine and magnificent, that it is no
more to be known to be a Copy from this
Original. The Father <HI>Benedictins</HI> of the Con∣gregation
of S. <HI>Maurus</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> have taken
the form of their Habit from this Figure, and
retain the same to this Day, as believing it
with Reason, to be the true Pattern. After we
had said our Prayers in this Little Chapel,
they led me to a little Garden, and they bade
me take notice of a huge Stone at the Top
of the Rock; they wished me to observe it
very well, as being no less than a perpetual
Miracle, which demonstrated the visible Pro∣tection
God afforded to that Holy Place, and
to those that dwelt there. This Stone, accord∣ing
to their Talk, was quit loosned from the
<PB N="232" REF="129"/>
Rock, and suspended in the Air, by the alone
Divine Power, God not suffering it to fall
down, because, if it should, it could not fail
of utterly destroying the Grotto, and the
whole Monastery. I told them, after that I
had viewed it very narrowly, that I saw it so
well fastned to the Rock, that in my thoughts
it would be a Miracle indeed if it should fall,
and that they ought not to pretend the con∣trary
to those that had good Eyes. I saw
well enough, that my Answer did not please
them; but I was so weary to hear them talk
of such kind of Miracles, which they will
force upon Men contrary to all Reason, that
I could not, by times, hinder my self from
expressing my resentment of it. The <HI>French</HI> Fa∣ther,
that was my Guide, wish'd me to cast
my Eye upon certain Rose-Trees, which were
in a Corner of the Garden, and told me,
that as soon as we were got out of the Hermi∣tage,
he would tell me the mystery of them.
And in the mean time he shewed me the rest
of the Buildings. I did not find the place so
frightful, as was the Impression they had
given me of it; tho' it must be owned, That
in S. <HI>Bennet</HI>'s Time it was a very Desert
place.</P>
<P>Having therefore taken a View of all, we
return'd to the Great Monastery, from
whence we came; where being arrived, the
Father told me as to those Rose-Trees, which
he had wished me to take notice of, that
<PB N="233" REF="129"/>
the Monks had not thought sitting to tell me
of the great Miracle, wherewith they com∣monly
entertain Strangers, for fear I should
reflect upon them for it, as I did upon occa∣sion
of the Stone. <HI>It is Related</HI> (said he) <HI>in the
Life of our Blessed Father S.</HI> Bennet, <HI>That he
had one day a furious Temptation of the Flesh in
this place; and that in order to quell it, he went
and rowled himself stark naked upon Thistles and
Thorns, that were near unto his Cell, and made all
his Body on a Gore-blood, until he found that the
Temptation was quite dissipated. Now the History
tells us, that these Thistles and Thorns, ting'd
with the Blood of S.</HI> Bennet, <HI>were miraculously
changed into Roses. Wherefore special Care has
been taken always to preserve these Rose-Trees, the
Roses whereof we dry, and being pulverized, do
exhibit them to those that are Sick; for it is an
universal Remedy against all manner of Diseases,
to those who take them in Faith.</HI> I told this
<HI>French</HI> Father, That the Monks his Confraters
had done very well not to mention this Mi∣racle
to me, for I should presently have put
them in mind of the Fable of <HI>Pyramis</HI> and
<HI>Thisbe,</HI> whose Blood changed the colour of
<HI>Mulberries</HI> from white to red. Could they
have shewn me Thistles, Nettles, or some
Blackberry-Bushes and Brambles that brought
forth Roses, this would have been something
rare indeed, I will not say miraculous (for I
know not whether they have found out the
Art of grafting Rose-Trees upon these kind of
<PB N="234" REF="130"/>
Wild Plants) but to shew a Man Rose-Tree
that bears Roses, this is a thing we see every
day, without ever dreaming of a Miracle.
And as to what concerns their miraculous
Operation, in Curing all manner of Maladies,
that they had very advisedly added this Clause,
<HI>If they be made use of in Faith:</HI> For if those
that take of this Powder in their Sickness
chance to die, 'tis because there was no Faith
in them; but if they escape, it is a plain
Miracle.</P>
<P>These Fathers are extream Rich, and almost
all the Country round about, to a very great
distance, belongs to them. The next Day I
went up to a Mountain, where they shewed
me a Chapel, which S. <HI>Bennet</HI> caus'd to be
built; and about Seven miles further, they
shewed me another, Dignified with a New
Miracle, which is, the Impression of the Body
of S. <HI>Bennet</HI> upon a Rock. The Story of it is
this, They tell us, <HI>That this Saint being on a
time Benighted, he was forc'd to beg Lodging of
a Priest that lived in those Parts, who very
uncivilly denied him. The Saint being so ex∣treamly
tired, that he could no longer keep him∣self
standing, lean'd against a Rock, which
received his Body with the same ease, as if it had
been a soft Bed, where he rested all that Night;
which impression of his Body</HI> (say they) <HI>remain'd
there ever since.</HI> True it is, that such an Im∣pression
is indeed found there, but who has
made it I cannot tell you, except you will believe
the Miracle.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="130"/>
From this place I took Directions of the
Way to <HI>Mont Cassin,</HI> which is about Three
small days Journy from thence. Here it is
you may take a view of the Glory of the
Monastick State, in all its lustre. The stately
Buildings which these Fathers have raised
upon this Mountain, make it appear to be the
Head of an Order. The place is exceed∣ing
pleasant, surrounded on all sides with
Rich Vallies, and Little Hills, over which
<HI>Mont Cassin</HI> commands by its height, and by
the Temporal and Spiritual Jurisdiction the
Monks do exercise over a great many Towns
Villages which lye round about it. Amongst
the rest there is a very pretty City situate at
the Foot of <HI>Mont Cassin,</HI> which is called
S. <HI>Germain.</HI> The Abbot has Episcopal Juris∣diction
there, and keeps his Grand Vicar, who
is a Monk of the same Order. I went to see
him, to get permission of him to say Mass, and
afterwards I went up to the Mountain. They
have made the Access to it very fair and easie,
and one ascends near Four <HI>Italian</HI> Miles, before
one comes to the Monastery. A man must
not expect here any great Antiquities, this Place
having been several times ruined by the Wars,
and by Fire, which did not so much as leave
one Stone upon another. The only Remain
of Antiquity they shew one is, the Remainder
of an Old Steeple, which the Monks have
extraordinarily embelish'd within, as supposing
it to be the place where S. <HI>Bennet</HI> died, and
<PB N="236" REF="131"/>
that God as by Miracle had preserved it,
amongst so many Desolations and Fires, as of
Old he did the Ark of <HI>Noah,</HI> in the midst of
the Deluge. They will have every one that
enters it, to put off his Shoes; and they them∣selves,
when they go in, make very strange
Postures and Faces. They maintain, That
they have the whole Body of S. <HI>Bennet</HI> in their
possession, and that what was said of his Tran∣slation
to the Monastery of <HI>Fleury</HI> in <HI>France,</HI>
is no more than a Fable: According to which
Supposition, all the great Miracles which the
<HI>Benedictins</HI> of <HI>France</HI> pretend to have wrought,
at the Translation of it, must be very grand
Impostures. And we may see by this scant∣ling,
how the Monks make no Bones of Ac∣cusing
one another of Fraud and Imposture,
when their Interest is concern'd.</P>
<P>Several Popes who had a Kindness for <HI>Mont
Cassin,</HI> have been pleased to make an Essay of
their Infallibility, by declaring, That the
Body, which they never saw, is there whole
and entire: Other Popes, on the contrary,
who were more concern'd for the <HI>Benedictins</HI>
of <HI>France,</HI> have Thunder'd out their <HI>Anathe∣thema's</HI>
against those that should say, That the
Body of the same S. <HI>Bennet</HI> was at <HI>Mont Cassin.</HI>
So that upon the matter, we do not know who
to believe, for here is Infallibility against In∣fallibility;
and a Papist cannot believe what
one Pope hath pronounced about it, without
falling into the Excommunications of another,
<PB N="237" REF="131"/>
which you'l say, is a very hard case. How∣soever
it may be, the Fathers of <HI>Mont Cassin</HI>
tell you plainly, That they have it; and for
proof thereof, they maintain a Race of great
Ravens in their Monasteries, which they de∣clare
to be the Off-spring of a Raven, who
render'd a great piece of Service to S. <HI>Bennet,</HI>
by carrying away an empoyson'd Leaf, which
a wicked Priest had sent him. These Ravens
are very familiar, and the Fathers tell us,
That the Charm which keeps them in that
Place, is the Odour of the Body of S. <HI>Bennet:</HI>
Tho' for my part, I should rather incline to
believe, That it is the Odour of their Fat
Kitchin; for they are continually stuffing of
them, and a great many Poor People might
have their Subsistence from what they allow
these Birds. These Ravens in Colour do well
resemble these Monks, who are Cloath'd all
in Black, and for distinctions sake are called
<HI>Black Fryers, Monachi Neri.</HI> Furthermore,
they shew'd me all the Regular Places, the
Cloisters, Dormitories, the Apartments for the
Officers, the Gardens, and the Backsides: All
which carry a greater shew of the Grandure
and Majesty of a Palace Royal, than of an
Abode for Monks. But the Church above all
things is extreamly well and sumptuously A∣dorn'd,
being embelish'd with Marble, Jasper,
Porphyry, and other precious Stones; and in
particular, the Gilding and Painting you see
there, are of an inestimable Value.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="132"/>
They observe still in this Abby, the Lau∣dable
Custom of Entertaining all Strangers,
and Pilgrims, according to their Rank and
Quality, and indeed Persons are very well en∣tertain'd
there, tho' it be only with Eggs,
Herbs, and Fish. For, as I have said, in ano∣ther
place, they profess to observe their Rule,
according to the Rigor of it, in this Mona∣stery,
in hopes of excusing, by this means, the
decadence and failure of all the rest. But I
have been since informed after what manner
they acquit themselves of their Vow. They
send their Religious by turns into the Coun∣try,
for a Month or two, to Fatten and Plump
them; which time expir'd, they recall them
again to their Observance, at which they
are kept the same space of time, after which
they send them again to be Fatted anew. Af∣ter
this manner do they mutually solace and
relieve one another amongst themselves with
an Holy Brotherly Love, whereby they find
themselves much benefited. One of these
Monks, on a time, suppos'd himself to have
found the Secret, to spare himself and his
Brethren, the Pains and Trouble of all these
Flittings and Removes. He had made his
reflection upon a Hymn of S. <HI>Ambrose,</HI> which
they Sing on Friday Morning, where speak∣ing
of the Works of the Fifth days Creation,
which were the Fishes and the Birds, he hath
these words,
<Q><PB N="239" REF="132"/>
<L>Qui fertili natos aquâ</L>
<L>Partim relinquis Gurgiti,</L>
<L>Partim levas in Aera.</L></Q>
From whence he inferr'd, that forasmuch as the
Fish and Birds proceeded both from one Matter,
to wit, the Water, they might indifferently
pass for Fish, as being in Substance nothing
but the same thing. Besides the Resemblance
there is between the Fins of Fishes, and the
Wings of Birds, helpt to flatter his Imagina∣tion,
as a further Confirmation of his Notion;
he desired his Brethren to Meditate a
while upon this Mystery, which being once
unfolded, might be so profitable to them.
The Notion was found to be very good, and
they made no more ado but with one con∣sent
presented a Petition to the Abbot, that
they might have leave from thence forward,
to Eat the Fish that flies in the Air. The
Abbot suppos'd that his Religious had taken
up the Holy Resolution of Reforming them∣selves
to a higher Degree, and that they would
for time to come, abstain wholly from Fish al∣so;
for if they Eat nothing, said he in him∣self,
but the Fish that flies in the Air, they
will not need any great store of Oil to Fry
them with. Wherefore he very readily grant∣ed
their Request; but he was extreamly asto∣nished,
when entring the next day into the
Refectory, he found all the Table charged
<PB N="240" REF="133"/>
with good Foul, both Boil'd and Roasted, as
Woodcocks, Partridges, and all others that
were in season. He presently sent for the
Steward of the Monastery to come to him,
and those who had made these Provisions, in∣tending
to Jobe them very severely: But they
putting him in mind of the Permission he had
granted them, and Quoting the passage out
of S. <HI>Ambrose,</HI> and the 20, 21, and 22 Ver∣ses
of the First Chapter of <HI>Genesis,</HI> the poor
Abbot, was put to a Nonplus, by the subtilty
of their Reasonings, and allow'd it should be
continued. The matter being divulged some
time after, it came to the Ears of their Car∣dinal
Protector at <HI>Rome,</HI> who sent a Letter to
them, by which he exhorted them, either
absolutely to Eat Flesh, if they had a desire
so to do, or else to Eat nothing but the Fish
that lives in the Waters, for that otherwise
it was to be feared, the People would learn
by their Example, to Eat cramb'd Capons in
<HI>Lent;</HI> and leaving the Swimming, betake
themselves to the Flying Fishes▪ It is not a∣bove
Twelve years since, that the Reformed
Benedictins of the Congregation of S. <HI>Marus</HI>
in <HI>France,</HI> practised much a like thing: They
Eat nothing but Otters and Badgers, as long
as they could get any of them, taking these
Animals for Fish, because they live along the
Rivers, and feed upon Fish; and foras∣much
as they did also Eat them in <HI>Lent,</HI> this
extreamly scandaliz'd the People in the Pro∣vinces
<PB N="241" REF="133"/>
of <HI>France,</HI> where Otters and Badgers
are look'd upon as Meat. Wherefore the
Bishops were fain to desire the Fathers, for
time to come, to abstain from eating of
them, as they do at present. By this it ap∣pears
that all this sort of People, who out∣wardly
profess to live a Life of Penance, do
it sore against their Will; and could one see
all that passes in Secret in their Monasteries,
the World would be no longer abus'd by
their Hypocrysie.</P>
<P>I shall only give you an account of one
famous Hermitage more, which lies in <HI>Swis∣serland,</HI>
and afterwards prosecute my Journy
to <HI>Naples.</HI> This Hermitage is call'd <HI>Encylas,</HI>
and the <HI>Benedictins,</HI> who have made them∣selves
Masters of it, have there at present a
very fair Abby. It is Situate upon a very
high Mountain, between the Canton of <HI>Zu∣rich,</HI>
and that of <HI>Solure.</HI> The Papists Flock
thither in Pilgrimage, from all parts of <HI>France,
Germany, Swisserland,</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> for the sake
of a Miraculous Chapel, which is to be seen
in that place. The History of it runs thus.
An Hermit having caus'd a Chapel to be
Built here, was at a loss to find a Bishop, who
would take the pains to come and Consecrate
it, in a place which was at so great a distance
from the Commerce of Men: But on a cer∣tain
Night as he was at Prayers, he saw Jesus
Christ coming down from Heaven, accompa∣nied
with his Blessed Mother, the Virgin <HI>Ma∣ry,</HI>
<PB N="242" REF="134"/>
the Twelve Apostles, and an infinite mul∣titude
of Angels. All this Heavenly Compa∣ny
entred the Chapel, and Jesus Christ com∣manded
the Sacerdotal Habits to be brought
forth, which the Angels immediately deliver'd
to him, and were all enrich'd with Pearls and
Diamonds. He took them all from their
Hands, and put them on, repeating the Pray∣ers
which the Priests are oblig'd to say, whilst
they put on the Sacred Habit. Observe here
by the by, that in one of these Prayers, the
Priest Prays, that <HI>God would be pleased to ex∣tinguish
in him the Carnal Concupiscence, that
reigns in his Members,</HI> and apply this if you
can, without the highest Sacrilege, to Jesus
Christ, who is the Eternal Purity. Our Savi∣our
then having put on his Sacerdotal Orna∣ments,
went and Consecrated the Chapel,
and afterwards the Altar; in performing
which, he observ'd all the Ceremonies, made
all the signs of the Cross, perform'd all the
Sprinklings of Holy-Water, dispatch'd all the
Anointings with the Holy-Oils, and pronou∣ced
all the Prayers, which are set down in
the <HI>Roman</HI> Ritual, for the Consecration of
Chapels, and Altars; the Apostles all this
while assisting him, and answering <HI>Amen</HI> to
all the Prayers, at the same time that the An∣gels
Sang the Musick, played upon Instru∣ments,
and in a word, made such a melodious
Consort, that the poor Hermit, who took a
View of all this, from one of the Corners of
<PB N="243" REF="134"/>
the Chapel, was wholly charm'd and ravish'd
with it. After that the Ceremony of Conse∣cration
was thus finish'd, Jesus Christ would
needs also Celebrate the first Mass there, and
having put on the rest of the required Or∣naments,
he went to the Altar; S. <HI>Peter</HI> and
S. <HI>Paul</HI> Ministred to him at the Mass. The
Hermit took notice that Jesus Christ did not
omit the least Ceremony, Benediction, Kneel∣ing,
or Prayer, that are contain'd in the <HI>Ro∣man</HI>
Missal. This done, he took the Commu∣nion
himself under both kinds, and afterwards
delivered it to his Blessed Mother, and all the
Apostles, concluding the Mass with an <HI>Ite mis∣sa
est,</HI> to which the Angelical Consort answe∣red
<HI>Deo Gratias.</HI> When all this was thus per∣form'd,
Jesus Christ together with all this Hea∣venly
Society return'd to Heaven, leaving
the Chapel Consecrated, as it is at present.
We are to take notice that this hapned at a
time, when Men believed Hermits upon
their bair Words, and when the living in a
Wood, or upon a Mountain, with a swinging
Cowl upon ones Head, past for an inconte∣stable
proof of Saintship. The Hermit writ
to the Bishop, that now he needed not to in∣commodate
himself to come and Consecrate
the Chapel, seeing that Jesus Christ himself,
had been pleased to save him that trouble.
The good People, who at that time were the
Inhabitants of those Mountains, and who
would have Swallow'd any thing, under the
<PB N="244" REF="135"/>
notion of a Miracle, gulp'd down this also.
This Chapel is to be seen there to this day,
whole and entire, and the <HI>Benedictins,</HI> who
have taken Possession of this Place, have Built
a great Church round about it, so that the
Great one, encloseth the Lesser.</P>
<P>These Fathers are very Rich, and have got
together a very great Treasury of Plate, by
means of this Devotion. And forasmuch as
they are almost on every side, surrounded
with Hereticks, (so they call the Protestants;)
they make use of abundance of Precaution,
and do not shew their Treasure to all the
World. They have enclosed it within a dou∣ble
Wall, to the end that in case of a Civil
War, the Protestants, might not be able to
find it. Near to the Abby, there is a fair Vil∣lage,
very well Built, and the outside of all
the Houses are Painted, which makes a very
fine shew. They are almost all Inhabited by
Inn-Keepers, who are furnished with excellent
Wine, which is a strong Magnetism for the
<HI>Swiss</HI> and <HI>German</HI> Pilgrims.</P>
<P>The <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks of this Country,
glory so much in having got so convincing a
Proof of the truth of their Mass, that they
openly declare, that Jesus Christ having fore∣seen
the fatal Revolution, which of late hath
hapned in <HI>Swisserland,</HI> by the perverse Do∣ctrin
of <HI>Calvin,</HI> denying the real presence of
the Holy Sacrament, was pleased beforehand
to Condemn this Doctrin, by his own offering
<PB N="245" REF="135"/>
up to his Eternal Father, the Bloodless Sacri∣fice
of the Holy Mass, with all the Ceremo∣nies,
the Holy Church of <HI>Rome</HI> makes use of.
It is to be suppos'd that Jesus Christ was
greatly pleased to find in the <HI>Roman</HI> Missal,
all those finical Additions, the Popes have
joyned to it; and especially with the invention
of those pretty little Hosts, to the composition
of which there enters more Wax than Flower.
I have frequently seen these Wafers made,
and I have some time for Recreation made
them them my self. They grease the Wa∣fer-Iron,
in which they make the Hosts, with
white-Wax, to make them the more firm.
This Wax being melted, Penetrates the Wa∣fers
through and through, and serves for a
Glew to hold them together. This was it,
our Adorable Lord and Saviour thought not
of, when he instituted his Sacrament; but
however approved very well of this new In∣vention,
in Celebrating the Mass at <HI>Encylas.</HI>
The <HI>Memento</HI> for the Dead, that is, the Pray∣ers
for the Souls in Purgatory, which they
have inserted into the Mass, pleased him also
extraordinary well: And seeing it cannot be
doubted, but that his Prayers were assuredly
heard; it will follow, that there was not so
much as one Soul left in Purgatory that day.
I have forgot to ask these good Catholicks,
whether Jesus Christ when he said Mass at
<HI>Encylas,</HI> gave the Communion to his Blessed
Mother and his Disciples, under both kinds?
<PB N="246" REF="136"/>
Or whether he conform'd himself to the
Modern Practice of the Church of <HI>Rome?</HI>
who communicate the People under one kind
only; if they affirm this Latter, I protest I
have taken the Resolution never to believe
them; and I will rather believe, that Jesus
Christ, who is the Eternal Wisdom, had dis∣posed
all things so wisely, in his Institution
of the Sacrament, that as there wanted no∣thing
that might be added, so neither was
there any thing superfluous to be taken away
from it. He would that all should Eat of the
Bread, and Drink of the Cup. <HI>Bibite ex eo
omnes: Drink ye all of it.</HI> This hath been the
constant Practice of the Primitive Church,
for many Ages; and I am so far from look∣ing
upon this first Church, as being very de∣fective
in all her Practices, as the Papists would
fain persuade us, that I shall always consider
it, as the True and Perfect Pattern and Mo∣del
of the Church, which our Lord and the
Apostles have left us, which we cannot under∣take
to mend, without spoiling it, and from
which we cannot depart without Sin. Some
ancient Churches, even of those that follow
the Communion of <HI>Rome,</HI> have in some sort
preserved the ancient Custom of Celebrating
the Lords Supper, tho' they look upon it on∣ly
at present, as one of the Ceremonies of
the Holy-Week, and they practise it only on
Munday and Thursday, but with several Ex∣cesses
and Indecencies, which ought to be re∣trenched
and put away.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="136"/>
I will give you a Relation here of what I
have seen practis'd at <HI>Mentz</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> where
I hapned to be for Two years together on
<HI>Holy-Thursday.</HI> This Day, after Morning-Service,
and the Washing of Feet, the Arch∣bishop,
the Great Canons, and all the other
Priests that serve in the Cathedral, go in
Procession to a Great Hall, that is near the
Church, which they call the <HI>Chapter-House,</HI>
there to Celebrate the Supper. The Seculars
that are of any Rank and Quality, have leave
to enter with the rest. There are great Benches
placed round about the Hall, where all the
Company seat themselves, and a great Table
in the midst, covered with a Table-Cloth,
upon which are placed large Cups or Goblets,
with other Pitchers and Vessels full of Wine,
and a vast quantity of great Wafers divided
into Pounds and half Pounds. The Arch∣bishop
being Arrayed in his Pontifical Habits,
reads with a loud Voice that part of the
Gospel, which contains the History of the
Supper; and afterwards blessing the Bread
and the Wine, he declares, That they are to
take this in memory of the Passion of our
Lord Jesus Christ, and to be obedient to the
Command he has left us, to <HI>do the same in Re∣membrance
of him.</HI> Thus after having taken
his part of the Wafers, which is of two or
three Pounds, because of his Dignity, he goes
and distributes the rest, to all those that are
present, a Service of one Pound to every
<PB N="248" REF="137"/>
Grand Canon, and of half a Pound to all
the rest, the same share being given to me
also. They spread a great Napkin before all
those that assist at the Supper, and every one
applies himself to eat these Wafers, which are
very thick, and of another sort than those
are, that they use at Mass. Formerly they
gave to all the Company pieces of Unlea∣vened
Bread; but these Wafers were in
After-times found more pleasing to the Palat,
and more fit to be Presented. The Arch∣bishop,
in the mean time, takes the Cup, or
rather, it is held to him, whilst he drinks;
for it is so large and so full of Wine, that
two of the Canons are scarcely able to support
it. After he hath drunk, he sends it to be
presented to the Great Canons, and then to
all those that sit on the Benches. They don't
amuse themselves with letting down a little
Gulp only, as is done at the Sacrament; but
they drink in good earnest, and fetch the
greatest Draughts they can: And there be
some of these <HI>German</HI> Gentlemen, that drink
above a Quart at a Draught; so that the
Cup, as big as it is, is nevertheless soon
emptied, and must be filled anew. The Wine
that is used on this occasion, must be of the
best Rhenish Wine that is to be got in all
the Territory of <HI>Mentz;</HI> and the Officers of
the Cathedral, have power to go and chuse
it that Day with great Ceremony in the
Electors Cellars. They pierce all the Vessels
<PB N="249" REF="137"/>
one after another, and take the Judgment of
some Learned Palats upon them. It is the
high Opinion they have conceiv'd of the
goodness of this Wine, that makes these
Gentlemen drink so heartily. The Great
Cup takes its Round five times, and so oft
every one of the Company drinks. But if
any one should chance in these Intervals, to
be tormented with Thirst, he needs only to
make a sign to the Priests, who are near to
the Table, where other Vessels stand ready,
in which they are presently served: Whilst
the Cup goes round, the Singing-Men and
the Musicians strike up their Notes and Sing,
(standing near the Table which holds the
Cups and the good Wine) that which the
Papists call <HI>Improperia,</HI> which are the Re∣proaches
our Saviour made to the <HI>Jews</HI> for
their Ingratitude, in Abusing him to that
degree as they did, notwithstanding all the
Benefits they had received of him.</P>
<P>I observ'd, that the Company kept them∣selves
in a great degree of Restraint and
Modesty at the first and second Round the
Cup made; but at the third Turn, when the
good Wine began to display its virtue, every
one began to Talk and Laugh; and the
Singing-men, who were willing to take their
shares of the good Wine, made Stops ever
and anon, to refresh themselves with the
pleasing Liquor; so that towards the end of
the Ceremony they were quite gon, and
<PB N="250" REF="138"/>
knew no longer what they sung. I was pretty
near one of the Grand Canons, and told him;
<HI>In truth, My Lord, I am astonished to see them
suffer these Singing-Men, to act all these Fooleries they
do in the midst of the Hall, and in your Presence;
and at a Function, which requires a great deal
of Modesty and Seriousness.</HI> He Answer'd me
very fiercely; <HI>We do not concern our selves with
those Men; they are a Company of pure Rogues,
they deserve indeed, to have their Legs and Arms
broke; but all that can be said for them is, that
they are drunk, and to speak truth, I am somewhat
engag'd that way my self.</HI> I found that he
spoke Truth, for the good Wine had seiz'd
his Capitol, as well as those of the rest of the
Company. My Host, with whom I lodged,
who was one of the Officers of the Grand
Chapter, return'd from thence very much
out of order, and own'd to have drunk above
six Quarts for his own share. He often call'd for
Wine extraordinarily, under pretence that the
bits of the Wafers which he eat, stuck in his
Throat. At last, when the Ceremony was
ended, which lasted about two Hours,
every one returned to his own Home, staggering
as they went, and running their Heads against
the Walls. The Gentlemen certainly would
be highly displeased, if they should be de∣prived
of the Cup that Day; and I question
whether the Pope, with all his Authority
would ever be able to bring it about.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="138"/>
Now if we set aside the Excesses, the Inde∣cencies,
and some other Improperties these
Men did commit in this Solemnity; sure it is,
that this is the true way of Administring the
Holy Supper, which has been continually
preserv'd in this Church. It seems probable,
that sometime or other they were in the belief,
that they could not satisfie the Command of
the Supper, by celebrating the Mass, and
Communicating in the manner as they do;
and therefore to remedy this in some degree,
they retain'd this Ceremony, which they call
the <HI>Lord's Precept;</HI> but surely they then ob∣served
it with more modesty and respect than
they do at present. Indeed, I know no Function
the Papists have, throughout the whole course
of the Year, that represents the Holy Supper;
for what I have now said of <HI>Mentz,</HI> is not
practis'd in any other of their Churches. I
know they commonly assign <HI>Easter-Day</HI> for
this purpose; but I can find nothing in the
whole Office of that Day, that represents any
thing of it: For the Mass hath no confor∣mity
at all with the Supper; and besides, the
People do not Communicate whilst the Mass
is celebrating, but after the Mass is ended,
and then the Priest, without making any
Prayer, and without declaring what he is
about to do, goes and puts into the Mouths
of all those that present themselves, a small
Consecrated Wafer, and saith to every one
of them; <HI>The Body of Jesus Christ preserve thy
<PB N="252" REF="139"/>
Soul to Life Eternal.</HI> Every one that has Re∣ceived
it, retires to a Corner of the Church,
to Pray in private; and then every one goes
home, without the least Prayer made in com∣mon.
Where therefore is the common Uni∣on,
or Communion in all this? They can∣not
say, that they partake all of one Bread,
for all the little Wafers they give are distinct,
some Old, and others New; some of them
bought at one Shop, and some at another,
and all of them (as was said) are so pene∣trated
with Wax, that it is hard to say whe∣ther
it be Bread or Wax. They do not so
much as once know, for the most part, that
this Action is to be performed in remem∣brance
of the Passion and Death of our Sa∣viour
Jesus Christ, neither is there so much
as one only word mention'd to put them in
mind of it. For my part, I must acknowledge
that I knew nothing of it, before that I
began to study Divinity; and I believed,
that to Communicate, was only to Receive
the Body of our Saviour, without being
obliged to call any thing to Remembrance.
And yet, this is that which is most expresly
declared in the Commandment of our Sa∣viour,
in the Institution of the Holy Supper;
<HI>Do this in Remembrance of me.</HI> And those who
Administer the Sacrament, have an Engage∣ment
lying upon them, <HI>to declare the Death of
our Lord,</HI> to make us remember it.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="139"/>
Notwithstanding that these various Rela∣tions
and Observations that I give you here,
seem to have no great Connexion with my
Journy to <HI>Naples;</HI> yet they do very well com∣port
with the General Subject I have pro∣pos'd
to my self, and which I may well call
the main scope and aim of my Work; which
is, to discover to you the rest of the Corrupt
and Superstitious Practices of the Church of
<HI>Rome,</HI> which are come to my knowledge.
I produce them one after another, according
as I find occasion; and in this regard, I
readily acknowledge this Treatise not to be
very Regular: For, because the most part of
these Matters have no great Connexion toge∣ther,
and that they cannot make out a whole
Chapter, or a Days Entertainment, I have
been obliged to follow this Method, tho'
somewhat Irregular, not being able to order
things better.</P>
<P>I shall conclude this Days Journy with an
Observation I made in my Journy from <HI>Mola</HI>
to <HI>Capua,</HI> which is this: Having struck out of
the High-Way, we entred into some Little
Villages, to refresh our selves. Whilst they
were Watering our Horses, we took a Turn
to see the Houses, and after what manner the
Poor People liv'd there. Their Houses are a
Company of Little Holes, I believe the
largest of them was not above twelve Foot
in length, but kept very Neat. We were
<PB N="254" REF="140"/>
astonish'd at the prodigious quantity of Wo∣men
we found in them; but we saw no Men
there, except only some few that were very
Ancient, the rest being gone to their La∣bour.</P>
<P>All the Old Women came out of their
Houses, carrying in their Hands Sausages,
and little Loaves of a kind of <HI>Turkish</HI> Corn,
which they call <HI>Fromenton,</HI> and some dry
Figs. They desired us to give them our
Blessing, and to accept of their Presents.
We took some of their Figs, and these good
People took this for a great Favour at our
Hands. Some of them amongst the rest,
pray'd us to come into their Houses, that
we might Bless some of their Wine, Water,
or Goats-Milk. We asked what they in∣tended
to do with it afterwards? They told
us, It was to give their Husbands to drink,
when they return'd from their Labour all
on a Sweat, that it might do them no pre∣judice.</P>
<P>I said to my Companion, That I could not
but admire the Faith of these People: Who
reply'd, That he took them all for Saints.
One of these good Women that over-heard
him, sent forth a deep Sigh, saying, <HI>That
for her part, she was no Saint; but as for her
deceased Mother, that certainly she had been one:
For she Prayed to God from Morning to Night,
for the Souls of Purgatory, and always kept her
House well-stor'd with good Provisions, for the
<PB N="255" REF="140"/>
Monks and Priests that passed by that Way.</HI>
I question'd them about some other Duties of
Christianity, and some Chief Articles of our
Faith, wherein I found them very Igno∣rant;
and some of them Answer'd me, <HI>That
their Curate was a very Learned Man, and
that he would satisfie us concerning these Points.</HI>
I found by this, that these Poor People were
arrived at that Blessed Ignorance and Sim∣plicity,
to which the Priests of the Church
of <HI>Rome</HI> would so fain reduce the whole
World, if it were in their Power. So we
returned to our Horses in the Inn, which
we found had been well look'd to; we were
served also with very good Wine, and when
we demanded what we had to Pay, they
would take none of our Mony, our Host
telling us, <HI>That we were Knights of Jesus
Christ, and that we had too much honoured him,
by coming under his Roof.</HI></P>
<P>Just as we were Mounting on Horse-back,
a Foot-Boy came to desire us to stay one
Moment; for that Count <HI>Ludovica</HI> his Ma∣ster
desired, if it might be acceptable to us,
to have our Company to <HI>Capua.</HI> Our Host
assured us, That he was a very vertuous
good Lord. So we stay'd for him, and Tra∣vell'd
together to <HI>Capua.</HI> We told him of
the Simplicity and Charity of the Poor
People of the Village where we Baited. He
said, That <HI>they were us'd to it, and that in all
the Villages at any distance from the High-Way,
<PB N="256" REF="141"/>
they were all of the same Temper; and that
the Monks and Priests took care to direct their
Course that Way, when they Travell'd, to spare
their Mony.</HI></P>
<P>Being Arrived at <HI>Capua,</HI> the Count Invited
us to accept of a Lodging with him, where
we were very Nobly Entertain'd, with a
Generosity and Open-heartedness, which is
not very common amongst the Noblemen of
<HI>Italy.</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS
ON A
JOURNY
TO
NAPLES.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The Fifth Days Journy.</HEAD>
<P>THis Day, which was the last of our
Journy, was the most Troublesom
to us of all the rest, because it was
a Fast of the Church. We return'd our
Acknowledgments to our Noble Count, who
had shewed himself so generous and splendid
in his Entertainment of us; and prosecuted
<PB N="258" REF="142"/>
our Journy to <HI>Averse,</HI> which is a very plea∣sant
and delicious City, situate between <HI>Capua</HI>
and <HI>Naples.</HI> We met with nothing conside∣rable
on the Way, with relation to my Sub∣ject;
only we cast our Eyes upon some Little
Chapels, which we found almost at the End
of every Field. These Chapels are no more
than so many Little Vaults, four or five Foot
long, and three or four Foot broad; and en∣tring
in, we found they contain'd the Picture
of a Crucifix, or of some Saint or other, who
are suppos'd to be the Tutelar Saints of those
Grounds, on which the Chapels are built.
We saw in most of these Chapels, Little Stones
hanging upon the Walls, being fastned with
Thred; as also Little Bones, small Tufts of
Hair, bits of Wood, shreds of Cloth, and an
hundred other things of like Nature. We got
some of the Peasants, who quitted their La∣bour,
to come and receive our Benediction,
to unfold to us the meaning of these things.
They told us, <HI>That they were the Vows of some
of the good Country People, according to the dif∣fernt
Occasions or Dangers they had been in.</HI>
Some of them that had caught Falls, as they
were going on their Way, had gather'd up the
Pebbles, or Flints, at which they had stumbled,
and carried them to the Chapel: Others had
brought thither the Sticks wherewith their
Masters had beaten them: Women that had
Quarrel'd and Fought together, very devoutly
carried thither the Hair they had plucked
<PB N="259" REF="142"/>
from one anothers Heads. These good People
believing, by a Superstition, whereof I had
never before seen an Instance, that by com∣mitting
the Instruments of their Mishap to
some one of these Chapels, they prevent the
hapning of the like Accident for time to
come.</P>
<P><HI>It may be some will Object to me here,</HI>
That I have been very diligent, in my Travels,
to take Notice of some inconsiderable Trifles, which
were not once worth the observing; and now
make use of them, to reproach and mortifie the
Papists.</P>
<P>To which I Answer, That if it may pass
for a kind of Excuse, to produce the Example
of others that have done the like, I can assert,
there are some who have made Remarks of
much less Importance, than is this I have last
mention'd. Father <HI>Mabillon,</HI> that Famous <HI>Be∣nedictin,</HI>
in the History of his Travels, gives us
a Relation of certain Women in <HI>Rome,</HI> who
creep up the Steps of the Portal of S. <HI>Peter</HI>'s
Church on their Knees; and makes this goodly
Reflection upon it, <HI>That this is some Remainder
of the Piety of the Emperour</HI> Theodosius, <HI>and of
his Veneration for that August Cathedral.</HI> In the
mean time we find, that it is not only in their
Approaches to this Magnificent Temple, that
these Women put themselves into these Po∣stures;
but that they also use the same in their
Drawing near almost to every Place, where
any Superstitious Worship is in Vogue; for I
<PB N="260" REF="143"/>
have seen both Men and Women shuffling on
their Knees, to these little Chapels built in the
Fields, whereof I am now speaking, where
there is nothing considerable, that deserves
any Veneration. Should a Papist be the Re∣lator
of these Actions, he would not fail to
exalt them to the Clouds, and set them forth as
most Signal Instances of an extraordinary Piety
and Devotion, and as Actions very Merito∣rious
in the sight of God; whereas, a Protestant
in giving an Account of them, would rather
deplore the Blindness of this Poor People, who
are so ignorant of the true Ways of Salvation,
as to believe, that by employing themselves in
this kind of Practices, they go strait to Heaven,
and that by this means their Sins are blotted
out, without having recourse to serious Repen∣tance.</P>
<P>The same Father <HI>Mabillon</HI> makes mention
of the Close-Stool, or Chair, with a Hole in
it, called <HI>Sedes Stercoraria,</HI> on which formerly
the Popes were carried, after their Exaltation
to the Throne of S. <HI>Peter.</HI> He puts an Expli∣cation
upon it, which I suppose was scarcely
thought of at that time. He saith, <HI>This Cere∣mony
was made use of, to put the Popes in mind,
after their Election, that they ought to keep them∣selves
humble in the midst of that Greatness, to
which God had been pleased to raise them, as from
the Dust and Dunghil, alluding to that of the
Psalmist,</HI> Psal. 113. 7. <HI>De Stercore erigens Paupe∣rem.</HI>
Some Writers, whom this Author terms
<PB N="261" REF="143"/>
<HI>Hereticks,</HI> give a very different account of it,
and say, <HI>That this kind of Chair was made use
of in the Ceremony of the Papal Exaltation, ever
since they had been Impos'd upon by Pope</HI> Joan,
<HI>as a necessary Precaution, to prevent the like
Mistake for the time to come: For they made the
Pope to Seat himself in this Chair, which after∣wards
they held Lifted up on High, till all the
Cardinals had perform'd their Scrutiny concerning
the Holy Father, Whether he was furnish'd with
all the Constitutive Parts of a Perfect Man.</HI>
'Tis hard to determine, whether of these two
Explications be the true one. However, the
Abolition they have since made of this Cere∣mony,
might make one suspect, that there
was indeed something in this Action, that
did not comport with the Glory of the Heads
of the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> or else, that the
Popes have renounced those humble Thoughts
of themselves, which this <HI>Close-Stool</HI> might
serve to inspire them with. I have Read in
the Books of Travellers, many other Obser∣vations,
which in dignity do not in the least
out-vy those which by times come to my mind,
and which I hear relate to you, rather for
the Consequences which may be drawn thence,
or for the Reflections they may occasion, than
for the importance of the Matters of Fact
themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="144"/>
After having taken some time to view these
Chapels, and observe the Superstitious Pra∣ctices
of these poor People, we have just now
related, we at last Arriv'd at <HI>Averse,</HI> where
we were Witnesses of a very pleasant Encoun∣ter,
which is well worth the relating in all its
Circumstances. For the better understanding
of it, I must put you in mind, that the <HI>Itali∣an</HI>
Dames are kept up, worse than Slaves, to
that degree, that they have not so much as the
liberty of the Rooms of their own Houses.
In the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> the Custom is to
lock them up in the Garrets, which for that
reason, they call the Womens Apartment.
Whenever they have a mind to buy any
thing, that is Cry'd along the Streets, or to
give an Alms to any poor Body, they have
Baskets, which they fasten to a great Rope,
and let them down to give or receive what
they please. A Fryer <HI>Carmelite</HI> who was ma∣king
his Quest (a genteel word to express Beg∣ging)
in honour of the little <HI>Scapulary,</HI> was
waiting under the Window of a Dame of
Quality, for the descent of some Alms; the
Gentlewoman it seems having too great a kind∣ness
for him, to send him away empty, con∣veigh'd
down to him in her Basket a great
white-Loaf, which the good Fryer was reach∣ing
out his Arms to receive; when two <HI>French</HI>
Men coming by, that were almost Famish'd,
prov'd more nimble than he, and disappointed
him of his Prey, for the one of them having
<PB N="263" REF="144"/>
rudely thrust the Fryer to the over-side of
the Street, the other laid hold upon the Basket,
and having taken out what was in it, they
both betook themselves to their Heils. The
<HI>Carmelite,</HI> who was sensible of his Guilt, and
was therefore very desirous of getting the
Loaf into his own hands, fell a running after
them with all his might, Crying out, Stop
the Thieves, stop the Thieves. Whereupon
the People soon stopt them, as supposing that
they had Robb'd something considerable; but
these poor Wretches gave good Evidence, that
it was nothing less than Necessity had put
them upon this Piece of Thievery, for with∣out
being mov'd or skar'd at the Uproar
made about them, he who had Stolen the Loaf;
broke it in two, and gave the one half of it
to his Companion. As this was doing, some
Papers dropt out of it upon the Street, which
an <HI>Italian</HI> immediately snatch'd up, and the
<HI>Carmelite,</HI> who till then had exprest such ear∣nestness
to have his Loaf back again, slipt away
through the Crowd, without making any fur∣ther
enquiries concerning it.</P>
<P>Every one of the Spectators, were curious
to know the Contents of these Papers, and the
<HI>Italian</HI> to avoid the Throng of People, retired
to one of the Chambers of the Inn, where
we were, for to read it. After that he had
read it by himself, he was willing to Com∣municate
it to all, for a notable Piece of Gal∣lantry,
that desir'd to hear it. There were
<PB N="264" REF="145"/>
two Letters, the one enclos'd in the other,
whereof the one was the Fryer <HI>Carmelite</HI>'s
Letter, and the other contain'd the Ladies
Answer. We heard both of them read, but
I am not able to repeat the Contents of them
to you word for word; therefore shall only
mention those Expressions I more particular∣ly
took notice of, for the Amorous Gallantry
they contain'd. Their Custom in <HI>Italy</HI> is to
demand Alms, for the honour of the Mother
of God, that is, the Holy Virgin, according∣ly
this Devout Fryer began his Letter with
these words: <HI>Anima devota della grand Madre</HI>
Venere, <HI>fatemi la Carità povero Fraticello, deh per
pietà datemi un squárdo, un riso, un bacio, qua∣lehe
cosetta, par l' amor del Dio</HI> Cupido. In
English thus: <HI>Devout Soul of the great Mother</HI>
Venus, <HI>give an Alms to a poor Fryer; vouchsafe
to me I pray you for Charity, a Look, a Smile,
a Kiss, some little thing or other, for the sake of
the God</HI> Cupido. At the bottom of his Letter,
he desir'd the Lady, that she would be pleas'd
to honour him with a word in Answer, and
to send him back his own Letter, as well to
set his Heart at rest, in that regard, as that
she might not be expos'd to a Surprize of her
Husband. The Letter had no Name to it,
and concluded with these words, <HI>the poorest
of all your Lovers.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="145"/>
<HI>The Ladies Answer had an Air of Galan∣try
no whit inferiour to that of the Fryers;
she told him,</HI> That if he had demanded any Fa∣vour
of her, she would before have desired him
to inform her of his Rank and Quality; but see∣ing
that he only demanded an Alms, every one
might without abasing themselves afford that to
the most poor and miserable. That tho' she had
had no opportunity of taking a view of him, other∣wise
than from the Garret Window, where she was
Imprison'd, yet that her sight was good enough to
discern he had a very good Countenance under his
Hood, and that she allow'd him from that very
moment, to study the best means of getting to her,
provided that it were done with all possible Precau∣tion.
That she might indeed have Burnt the Let∣ter
he had sent her, but that she suppos'd it would
have been an ill Presage, to Condemn to the Fire
the first Fruits of his Love towards her; and that
she doubted not, since he had been so circumspect
in the securing of his own Letter, but he would
be at least as careful for the Answer she sent him,
that it might never fall into the hand of her Ty∣rant,
<HI>(meaning her Husband:)</HI> She concluded
with the most tender Expressions, that could be in∣vented
by the most ardent Affection, and desired
the Fryer not to fail of returning the next day, at
the same Hour, to make his Quest; assuring him,
that he might build upon her Charity.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="146"/>
Tho' these Letters seem'd to be Pleasant
enough, yet the most Understanding and
Virtuous of those who heard them read, could
not but express something of Horror, to see
Wickedness covering it self with the pretext
of Godliness, and Stalking up and down in
the Disguise of a Habit so Holy in outward
appearance. They sent out some Persons by
several ways, to look for the Fryer, but they
could not meet with him; only they Learnt,
at a House where he had Lodg'd, three or
four days before, that he was one of the great
Convent of the <HI>Carmelites</HI> in <HI>Naples,</HI> and
that he had been sent to make Quest in the
Countries round about. My Companion, who
had some Letters to deliver to the Fathers of
the said Convent, took upon him to inform
the Prior of the whole matter, as soon as we
should be Arriv'd there, if they would deliver
to him the Letters of this Fryer Questor.
The Letters were accordingly deliver'd to
him by the <HI>Italian,</HI> after that he had first ta∣ken
a Copy of them. That which favour'd
the Lady in this Business, was, that the two
<HI>French</HI> Beggars, who had minded nothing but
the Prey they long'd for, and who after they
had seiz'd it, had run three or four Streets
to save themselves from the Pursuit of the
<HI>Carmelite,</HI> could by no means find out the
House again of this Charitable Creature, nei∣ther
was there any <HI>Italian</HI> found, that was in
the humour to own it for his Wives hand.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="146"/>
This Honest Gentleman my Companion did
not fail two or three days after his Arrival at
<HI>Naples,</HI> to acquit himself of his Commissi∣on;
but he received nothing but Frowns and
Displeasure for his Pains; for having acquaint∣ed
the Prior of the <HI>Carmelites</HI> with it, they
flatly denied that any Fryer of their Convent
had been sent upon the Quest to <HI>Averse</HI> at
that time; yea, they abused him with ill
Language, asking him by what Authority he
had charged himself with this Commission,
as if it were the Office of Priests to take cog∣nizance
of the doings of Fryers? That they
were sure, the Priests had no reason for their
parts, to reproach their good Manners, see∣ing
they themselves led such very Loose and
Scandalous Lives.</P>
<P>The good Gentleman, seeing that the Pri∣or
began to be in a great Passion, and fear∣ing
lest the Religious might think fitting
to give him the Discipline for his Pains,
made his humble Excuses to them, and with∣drew
himself, saying, that what he had done
in this Matter, was not in the least done with
any intention to Insult them; but only because
he thought himself bound in Charity to ad∣vertize
them of a thing for which they were
so much reproached at <HI>Averse,</HI> and which
probably they might find out some means to
remedy. The Prior accordingly, notwith∣standing
the bad Humour he was in, did not
fail of sending the very same day, the Stew∣ard
<PB N="268" REF="147"/>
of the Convent to <HI>Averse,</HI> with Or∣ders
dexterously to divulge there, that the
Fryer Questor, who had plaid these gallant
Tricks, did not belong to their Monastery,
and that in all probabilty, it must have been
some Secular, that had made bold with their
Habit, the better to act his Part.</P>
<P>It is true enough, that sometimes Seculars
Disguise themselves in the Habits of Fryers,
to accomplish their Ends, as knowing that no∣thing
can be invented more proper to give
them a free access to all Houses: For not∣withstanding
that the Men of the World are
daily Trappand by these wretched Monks,
yet for all that they retain as great a re∣spect
for their Habit, as for the most Sacred
thing in the whole World; and the Monks,
that on their side, they may not be wanting
to the daily encrease of this Veneration,
scarcely Preach up any thing else but the Sa∣credness
of their Habits. Therefore it is
that these Habits, by the great esteem Men
have of them, are so very Proper and ac∣commodate
to Cloak all manner of Wicked∣ness
and Treason, and consequently are made
use of, to facilitate the escape of Criminals,
to Murther People in their Houses, to main∣tain
secret Correspondencies in Cities, for to
Burn and betray them; and in a word, to
commit Adulteries, Incest, all manner of
Cheats, and Persidiousness, Murthers, and
Sacriledge; yea, what is more, to attempt the
<PB N="269" REF="147"/>
Sacred Lives of Kings, whereof we meet with
too many fatal Instances in History. A <HI>Turk,</HI>
to whom the Prince of <HI>Mirandula,</HI> gave a
Relation of the different Religious Orders,
there were in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and who
(as he said) were the Ornament of it; Reply'd,
That if there was but one of them, they
would be sufficient to exterminate all the
Princes of the Earth. It seems he had Read
something of our Histories. So many dreadful
<HI>Catastrophes</HI> which daily happen by these pieces
of Cloth, shap'd after an Antick manner, and
ridiculous Figure, one would think might be
sufficient (if there were no other Reason for it,
but the Conservation of their States) wholly
to cut them off from the Church; for Religion
and the State ought to be so perfectly united,
that the one may not betray the other, nor
give occasion to any Dissension or Misunder∣standing
therein. Whereas it is true in the
Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> that they would sooner
trample upon a Royal Robe, than upon the
Frock of a Monk; because this Habit in it
self, tho' it may be he that wears it may be
oft-times worse than the Devil himself, is ac∣counted
most superlatively holy.</P>
<P>They call <HI>Italy,</HI> the <HI>Country of Monks,</HI> not
only upon the account, that <HI>Monks</HI> (under
which Word I comprehend all the Religious)
do live very happily there, and have made,
as it were, their Paradice of it; but also
because all the <HI>Italians</HI> are in some degree
<PB N="270" REF="148"/>
Monks. Those who have not been of their
Number during their Lives, will at least be so
after their Deaths. They specifie in their Last
Wills, the Religious Habit in which they will
be Buried; One will be drest up like a <HI>Bene∣dictin,</HI>
another like a <HI>Carmelite,</HI> and so for the
rest. When the Bodies of any of these are
Carried to the Ground, their Biers and Coffins
are uncovered, that every one may see them
drest in their Monastick Habits, whereas the
Biers of other Persons are always covered.
The Monks tell us, That it is an Honour due
to their Habits, that nothing can interpose
betwixt them and Heaven; because they have
the virtue of immediately uniting to that place
of Bliss.</P>
<P>A Wax-Merchant at <HI>Venice,</HI> who had Cut
his own Throat, because having bought up a
great quantity of Wax, the Price of it
chanced to fall some Days after, had Breath
enough left him, after the Wound given, to
declare, That he would be Buried in a <HI>Capu∣cin</HI>'s
Habit; and soon after died thus in De∣spair.
His Relations therefore executed his
Last Will, and I saw this Wretch carried
through the Streets in his <HI>Capucin</HI> Dress, with
his Throat Cut: Now I would fain know,
Whether his Accoutrement had the virtue of
immediately uniting him to Heaven. Externals
have to that pitch gain'd the Ascendant in the
Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> that true Vertue seems wholly
banished from it.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="148"/>
We departed from <HI>Averse,</HI> as soon as we had
Dined, and we Arrived (without putting our
selves or our Horses much to it) timely enough
in the great Suburbs of <HI>Naples.</HI> The Gentle∣man
with whom I was in Company, did
not think himself in an Equipage good enough,
to enter the City that Day; and I, because I
would not leave him, took up my Lodging in
an Inn of the Suburbs with him. The Host
was a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and the first thing he demanded
of us was, Whether we were Fasting? We
told him, That we had Dined at <HI>Averse;</HI> and
the Gentleman's Servant had acquainted him,
that we had been very well Treated. How∣ever
my Companion, who was not us'd to
Travel, and who found himself weary with
his Journy, gave Orders for a Supper to be
made ready, and under the pretext of his not
being very well, he would have them get some
fresh Eggs for him. The Host very obligingly
promis'd to get all things ready; but when
Supper-time was come, we found nothing but
two bits of Bread upon the Table, and some
Fruit. My Companion sent word to the Host,
to have the rest of the Supper sent up, with
the fresh Eggs; who came himself to return
him an Answer, which was to this purpose,
<HI>That he wish'd the Gentleman to call to mind, that
it was a Fast-Day, and that being a Clergy-Man,
he was oblig'd (more than any one else) to give a
good Example; and that in keeping his Fast, he
would at the same time perform two Duties, the
<PB N="272" REF="149"/>
first in keeping the Fast; and the other by not
offending any one.</HI> This Clergy-Man, that was
not used to be reprov'd by Seculars, who ordi∣narily
dare not Reproach Men of their Coat,
came to great Words with the Host, and told
him, that he had good Friends enough at
<HI>Naples,</HI> that would make him repent of his
Insolence: The Host, on the other side, threat∣ned
him with the Inquisition, saying, <HI>That he
knew no reason why he might not be put there, as
well as his Wife, who had lain there already three
Years, for having eaten a little piece of Cheese on
a Fast-Day, when she was Big with Child; and
that she had been Inform'd against by two Priests,
who had Lodged in his House, and had committed
there all manner of Excesses.</HI> We perceiv'd very
well, that our Host was transported with a
very violent Passion, and therefore we thought
fit to change our Inn, notwithstanding that it
was very Late. Forasmuch as I had had no
manner of Quarrel with him, he did in a
manner Excuse himself to me; protesting to
me, <HI>That for the space of Twenty two Years that
he had kept an Inn, he never had seen so much as
one Priest or Monk that kept the Fasts of the
Church; tho' they made a great Crime of it, to
those poor Seculars that were Convict of that
Transgression.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="149"/>
Because this Adventure has put me upon
mentioning the Fasts of the Papists, I shall take
occasion truly to declare to you, after what
manner they observe their Fasts in the Church
of <HI>Rome;</HI> and enquire, Whether their Practice
be so evident a Mark of the Purity and Holi∣ness
of their Communion, as they pretend.
The Fasts Commanded by the Church of
<HI>Rome,</HI> under the Penalty of Mortal Sin, and
other Chastisements Corporal and Pecuniary,
are, <HI>Lent,</HI> the <HI>Quater Temps,</HI> or <HI>Four Times,</HI>
and the <HI>Vigils</HI> or <HI>Eves.</HI> As for the time of
<HI>Advent,</HI> they leave it to every ones liberty, to
Fast or not, according as their Devotion or
Inclination sways them. The Abstinence from
Meat is inseparably joyn'd with all their
Fasts; for the Papists do not believe, that
any Fast can be truly kept without abstaining
from Flesh-Meat; and they suppose this to be
the most Essential part of a Fast. In those
Countries where the Inquisition is established,
those who break their Abstinence, may fall
under the Rigor of that Tribunal; but in
other Countries, the Bishops of every Diocess
have Power to punish Spiritually and Corpo∣rally
those that Transgress this way. More∣over,
every Priest in particular is obliged, at
Confession, to impose upon them some Punish∣ment,
equivalent to the Breaking of their
Fast.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="150"/>
Now these for the most part are Pecuniary
Mulcts, because by this means they serve two
Ends, <HI>viz.</HI> that of Mortifying their Peni∣tents,
and of Greasing their own Fists. As
for Example, They will order a Person, who
hath fail'd of Fasting in any one Day of
<HI>Lent,</HI> to put a Crown into the Parish Trunk
or Chest, and so proportionably if they have
Transgrest oftner. The Priests from time to
time take care to empty the Trunk, and
divide the Mony amongst themselves. Infants
and Old Men, at a certain Age, are exempt
from Fasting, but not from the Abstinence
from Meat; and none are excused from Ab∣stinence
and from Fasting, save only such as
are Sick; and they also must have an Attesta∣tion
in Writing, under the Hand of a Phy∣sician,
that they are really and truly so; and
upon this Attestation, they grant them a Per∣mission
to Eat Meat, and consequently not
to Fast. There be some Butchers particularly
Appointed to sell Flesh on those Days, with
strict Orders, Not to sell any Meat, except
to those only who have such a Permis∣sion.</P>
<P>Here it is we may take Notice, how hearty
the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> are in the Observance
of their Fasts, whereof they boast so much;
for it may be asserted of a Truth, that above
three Fourth Parts amongst them get these
Permissions from their Physicians and Curates,
without any real need, and only for some
<PB N="275" REF="150"/>
pretended Sicknesses, which indeed they are
not afflicted with; or else, they make the
most of some little Indispositions they are
subject to by times, to excuse them from the
trouble of Fasting. The Physicians are obliged
to take their words for it, and the Curates
refer themselves to the Physicians. The Cu∣rates
are assured, That the more there be
of such Persons, who in this regard burthen
their Consciences, the more Mony they shall
put into their Pockets at <HI>Easter,</HI> when their
Parishioners come to Confess to them. Thus
we may well say, That tho' these People
have paid their Butchers for the Meat they
had of them; yet it is not all paid, till they
have Talk'd with their Confessor, and satisfied
his After-reckoning. As for what concerns
the Priests and Monks, they take their Per∣missions
from themselves; and there be but
few Clergy-Men to be found, that keep <HI>Lent;</HI>
or in cast they do, it is with such Profusion
and Dainties of Fish, that makes their Absti∣nence
from Flesh much more grateful, than the
<HI>Shro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etide,</HI> which usher'd it in. True it is,
that amongst the Seculars, there be found
many Poor People, who are not in a con∣dition
of making these Expences, and who,
fearing to be too high Taxed by their Cu∣rates
at <HI>Easter,</HI> are fain to Fast the whole
<HI>Lent</HI> out, not without a great deal of Trou∣ble:
Which is the Reason of that Common
Saying among the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> that
<PB N="276" REF="151"/>
<HI>Lent is only for the Poor.</HI> Lastly, to say the
most, If amongst the great Number of Pa∣pists,
that enjoy Plenty, there be some whose
Consciences are tender enough, to put them
upon a Resolution of Fasting, it is still only
after the manner of <HI>Rome,</HI> which imports,
that they must eat no more than Twice aday.
They take their Chief Meal at Noon, and
they may then without scruple Eat as much
as they please.</P>
<P>A Doctor of Physick, who had been at
Dinner in a Monastery, upon a Fast-Day,
told me merrily, That these Monks had made
him lay in Provisions enough for Three days,
he had so stuft his Belly amongst them. At
Evening they make a Collation, at which
they eat Fruits, Sweet-Meats, and other such
like things; and Fried-Fish, amongst other
things, passeth for a Dish that may be used at
Collations.</P>
<P>The Ancient Custom of the Church of
<HI>Rome</HI> in their Fasts, was to Eat but once
aday, after Sun-set, when Even-song was be∣gun;
but forasmuch, as this Practice did not
agree with the Delicateness of the Clergy,
the Ecclesiasticks lighted on a pleasant In∣vention
to illude it; They formed an Office,
or Set of Prayers, which they called <HI>Vespers,</HI>
or <HI>Even-song:</HI> And to the end they may ob∣serve
the Rule of not Eating till after Even-song,
they celebrate their Evening-Prayer in
the Morning.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="151"/>
Now if this be not very ridiculous, and if
this be not impudently to Mock at all manner
of Honesty and Sincerity, I leave you to
judge. Just as if the Ministers of the Church
of <HI>England</HI> should go about to persuade the
People, That for to eat their Suppers betimes
in the Morning, they need only to say their
Evening-Prayer very early.</P>
<P>The Fasts, as to the quality of the Viands
that are eaten, are very differently observed
amongst the Papists: In some Countries they
abstain from Eggs, Butter, and Cheese; and
in others, they make no scruple of Eating
them. In some Countries they express a
very great distaste of <HI>Lent.</HI> I Sojourned two
whole Years at <HI>Mentz</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> and the
Electoral Archbishop, the First Year dis∣pensed
with the Observance of <HI>Lent</HI> through∣out
all his Diocess, except only the Holy-Week,
or Week before <HI>Easter;</HI> and the Se∣cond
Year he Ordered, they should only Fast
three times a Week. They have a very plea∣sant
way of Fasting in <HI>Germany:</HI> After that
they have eaten a good Dinner in the Morn∣ing,
they may (if they please) Eat and Drink
all the rest of the Day, as long as they eat no
hot Meat: They may eat Broth, Fish, Eggs, &amp;c.
so they be but Cold before they fall upon them;
which is the Reason, why in <HI>Germany</HI> they
always take care, to have their Cupboards
well provided with Cold Meats in <HI>Lent</HI> time.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="152"/>
Again, there are other places where they are
as strict and scrupulous in the observance of
<HI>Lent,</HI> especially in the Countries that are un∣der
the Dominion of <HI>Spain.</HI> The Priests are
bound at <HI>Milan</HI> to Preach a Sermon at the
beginning of <HI>Lent,</HI> to take away those Scru∣ples
that may arise in the minds of the Peo∣ple,
about Fasting and Abstinence. This
Sermon is always compos'd of Questions and
Answers, much like the <HI>Athenian Mercury</HI>
we have here in <HI>London,</HI> and every one sends
his Doubts to the Preacher, who resolves
them the best he can. I once heard one of
these Casuistical Sermons in the Church of
S. <HI>Anthony,</HI> where abundance of very ridi∣culous
Doubts were propos'd. Amongst other
things, the Question was asked, <HI>Whether it
were lawful to eat Figs?</HI> And the difficulty
was, because this Fruit contains a sort of Milk
in it, whilst it is green, which is turn'd af∣terwards
into that sweetness which is found in
them, when they are fully Ripe; now all
sorts of white-Meats, that is, things made of
Milk are forbid in <HI>Italy:</HI> The Question was
very Learnedly Resolv'd in favour of the Figs,
and they were happily incorporated amongst
the <HI>Lent</HI> Viands, because the Milky Juice in
the Figs contain'd no Cream or Fatness,
and because neither Butter nor Cheese could
be made of it: And he added this Corollary,
that upon the same account, Almond-milk
was a good and lawful <HI>Lent</HI> Meat, and that
<PB N="279" REF="152"/>
with it they might prepare their Rice-milk.
I lived for some time in a Monastery at
<HI>Milan,</HI> where three times a Week, we had
Rice-milk drest after this manner, which was
much more delicate, than if it had been
prepar'd with Cows-milk. The Learned Fa∣ther
at last concluded this Question, with
this shameless Expression, That it was lawful
also to eat Mandrakes, notwithstanding these
Fruits did very lively represent the Members
of Man and Woman. I beg my Readers
excuse for making use of his own words.</P>
<P>Another Question was, <HI>Whether at their
Evening Collations, they might dip their Bread in
Wine?</HI> The reason of the difficulty was, be∣cause
according to the Rules of their Fasts,
they are not permitted to eat any <HI>Menestre,</HI>
that is, Pottage, at Night; and many believe,
that by dipping their Bread in Wine or Water,
they change the nature of Bread, and make
a kind of Pottage of it. I my self have
seen many Persons, who otherwise were ve∣ry
sensible understanding People, who made
no difficulty of eating Bread and Fruit in
abundance in the Evening at their Collati∣ons,
and to wash them down with two or
three Bottles of good Wine, who yet in the
mean time made a great scruple to dip a bit
of Bread in Wine, and to eat it. But how∣ever
the Question was decided in favour of
these who did dip their Bread in Wine. He
back'd his Decision with an Example very
<PB N="280" REF="153"/>
convincing to a Papist, and such as hit the
Nail on the head: When you receive, said
he, the Body of Christ in the Communion,
the Priest puts a little Wafer into your Mouth,
which immediately is penetrated throughout
with your Spittle; and yet the Faith teach∣eth
you, that the Body of Jesus Christ re∣mains
there still, and that none of the Ac∣cidents
are corrupted by the humectation
or penetration of the Spittle: In the very
same manner (said he) when you Sop your
Bread in Wine, this makes no change at all,
in that which you take, not a jot more than
if you should eat the Bread, and drink your
Wine separately, so that you may for time
to come safely do it without any scruple.
In a word, this Father resolved a vast
number of Difficulties, that had been pro∣pounded
to him, and which for the most part
were of the same Stamp with those I have
given you a taste of.</P>
<P>Because we are speaking of the Observa∣tion
of <HI>Lent</HI> at <HI>Milan,</HI> you may take notice,
that <HI>Lent</HI> begins there four days later, than
in all the other parts of <HI>Italy,</HI> by a Priviledge
they pretend to hold from S. <HI>Ambrose.</HI> Now
for these four days, a vast quantity of People
from all Parts of <HI>Italy</HI> repair thither, to enjoy
this Priviledge; and I have known Persons
that came above one hundred Leagues;
which shews that there is a strange Avidity in
the Papists, to eat Flesh at the time it is for∣bid
<PB N="281" REF="153"/>
them. Now these days are no sooner
ended, but all this Crowd makes as much
haste to get away from thence, as before
they made haste to get thither; the reason is,
because afterwards the <HI>Quadragesimal</HI> Absti∣nence
is observed with much more rigour
and exactness at <HI>Milan,</HI> than in any other
part of <HI>Italy,</HI> excepting only those, that have
Licences, which, as I have mentioned be∣fore,
are always in great Numbers. If any one
be found that transgresseth the Rules of the
<HI>Lent</HI> Fast, they are sent immediately to the
Inquisition, and proceeded against as Here∣ticks.
The <HI>Spaniards</HI> will allow of no slack∣ning
of this Point, in those Countries that
are subject to them. In the time when
<HI>Burgundy</HI> was under <HI>Spain,</HI> they observed
the Fasts of the Church much more rigorou∣sly
than they do now, since it is under the
Dominion of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>An Officer of the great Chapter of <HI>Mentz,</HI>
gave me the Relation of a troublesome Ac∣cident,
tho' the passages of it be very plea∣sant,
which hapned to him, and three of
the great Canons of <HI>Mentz,</HI> with relation
to Fasting. They had taken a view of the
greatest part of <HI>France,</HI> and they returned to
their own Country through <HI>Burgundy,</HI> in time
of <HI>Lent.</HI> As they were Travelling from <HI>Dola</HI>
to <HI>Besançon,</HI> this Officer hapned to kill a
great Hen in the Fields, and the Gentlemen
Canons having Congratulated his good Luck,
<PB N="282" REF="154"/>
resolved to eat it at the first Inn they should
come at. Being Arriv'd about Dinner-time,
at the first Village they met with, they or∣dered
a great Fire to be made in their Cham∣ber,
and the Officer commanded them to
bring up a Kettle, without saying what he
intended to do with it: Their Hostess brought
them one, but being seiz'd with a curiosity
to know what use they would put it to; she
spi'd them so well, that she found they were
Boyling a Hen. Whereupon she presently
ran out of Doors and told her Neighbours,
who came all running away in Throngs, no
otherwise than if the House had been on
Fire. The Hostess led them the way to the
Chamber of these Gentlemen, and in a fu∣rious
Transport, demanded her Kettle again;
they desired her to have Patience a little, tel∣ling
her that what they had put into it,
was almost Boyled; but the Woman in a
great rage, snatch'd the Kettle from off the
Fire, and the Officer forc'd it from her a∣gain,
to have his Hen.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Neighbours all
came up at the Noise, and belching forth
the most execrable Oaths, (which were far
worse than the breaking of the Fast,) threat∣ned
the Gentlemen to kill them immediately,
if they did not render themselves Prisoners.
These Grand Canons, who were all of them
Lords of great Quality, in vain call'd up for
their Foot-Boys, drest in their rich Liveries,
<PB N="283" REF="154"/>
and put off their Riding Coats, which co∣vered
their rich Silk Habits, and shewed
them their Golden Crosses and the fair Me∣dals
hanging about their Necks. These Vil∣lanous
Peasants, in spite of all they could shew
or alledge, made them get on Horse-back,
and having bound them with Cords, in a
most ignominious manner, they Conducted
them with a strange Hue and Cry, car∣rying
the Par-boil'd Hen ty'd to the top of a
Staff, before them, till they came to the City
of <HI>Besançon,</HI> which was about Eight Leagues
from the Village, insulting over them with
a thousand Affronts all along the Way, as if
they had been Hereticks.</P>
<P>As soon as they were come into the City,
a vast Throng of People came from all Parts
to see them, flinging Dirt and Stones at them,
and crying aloud, Burn them alive; Burn them
alive. They brought them in this Posture
straight to the Archbishop, who being im∣mediately
inform'd who they were, brought
them into one of the Dining-Rooms of his
Palace, and had very much ado to appease
the Rabble. After that he had signified to
them the Humour of the People of that Coun∣try,
and the extream Danger to which they
had expos'd themselves, he exprest to them
the sensible Regret he had for the Affront
they had received, and shewed them a thou∣sand
Civilities, in Token of the Respect he
bore to the Canons of the most Noble
<PB N="284" REF="155"/>
Chapter, that was in the whole Empire. And
the next day very early in the Morning,
he let them escape by a back Door, for fear
of their being Torn to pieces by the Rabble.
See here what an Extravagant Zeal for Su∣perstitious
Observances is capable to produce;
neither Civility, nor Virtue, nor Reason, be∣ing
able to gave Check to the furious Effects
thereof. Jesus Christ certainly never left us
any such Spirit, or any such Religion. It
wanted but very little of our falling into the
same Trouble, by the Imprudence of my Com∣panion,
the Evening we Arriv'd in the Su∣burbs
of <HI>Naples;</HI> and had they put us into
the Inquisition, it would have been much
worse with us.</P>
<P>I do not in the least disapprove of Fasts;
but on the contrary think them to be both
commendable and useful for a Christian to
Exercise them, especially when accompanied
with Prayers and Alms-giving, for the humb∣ling
of our Souls, and the subduing and sub∣jecting
our Bodies to the Spirit; that is, for
the Mortifying our Brutal Passions, which
commonly owe their force and vigour to a
healthy pamper'd State of the Body, and too
great Repletion; and to give the Spirit a
greater liberty and agility in the practice of
Virtue. Nay, what is more, I could wish
with all my Heart, that Christians would ex∣ercise
themselves by times alltogether, in this
good Practice, to the End of Encouraging
<PB N="285" REF="155"/>
one another by their good Examples, and by
their Union in so good a Work, to draw
down upon themselves the Heavenly Blessing.
But I cannot by any means approve the
going about to force People to this Duty, by
the Confiscation of all their Goods, by Tor∣tures
and Fire, and by a most pitiless and
cruel Inquisition. I don't believe, that God
ever gave such Power to Men over one ano∣ther,
as to proceed to such barbarous and
inhuman Constraints; and those who pretend
to such a Power, ought not to be called
<HI>Pastors,</HI> but <HI>Robbers</HI> and <HI>Murtherers,</HI> who are
got into the Sheepfold only, to rob, destroy
and kill.</P>
<P>The next Morning betimes we Entred the
City of <HI>Naples,</HI> where I made a Stay of
Three Weeks. I went to Visit the Great
Hospital for the Sick, which without doubt
is very well Administred; neither is the Di∣rection
of it in the Hands of Monks and
Priests; but the Nobility of <HI>Naples</HI> have the
whole ordering of it. I was extreamly edi∣fied
to see a Score of Gentlemen, Knights,
Earls and Marquesses, who served there in
their Turns by Weeks, and who themselves
carried Broth and Meat to the Sick, having
their great Rapiers by their Sides, after the
<HI>Spanish</HI> Mode, with a Neatness and Chear∣fulness,
capable of alleviating the Maladies of
these poor Patients. The Apartment for Wo∣men
<PB N="286" REF="156"/>
was up Stairs, who were served in the
same manner by Noble Matrons. I have
Visited many other Hospitals in <HI>Italy,</HI> ap∣pointed
for Sick-People, which were Go∣verned
by Fryers, whom they call <HI>Brothers of
Charity;</HI> but never met with any thing that
might be compared with that of <HI>Naples.</HI>
These Monks are commonly very peevish and
cross, and frequently Abuse the Sick with
Words and Stroaks, after having taken to
their own share, the best part of the Cha∣rities,
that are sent to the poor Sick. I could
not keep my self, upon a time, from saying
to one of these Monks, who had Beaten one
of the poor Sick, That that Action of his
struck me with Horrour. To Excuse himself,
he told me, <HI>That I did not know that Sick
Person so well as he did, and that he was one of
those, who notwithstanding that they are perfectly
Cured, do yet complain continually, only that they
may remain still in the Hospital; and that to
make them weary of it, they were forced to Abuse
them in this manner.</HI></P>
<P>They had none of all these base and unwor∣thy
Considerations in this Great Hospital of
<HI>Naples;</HI> on the contrary, they took Methods
quite opposite to those now mention'd, to
incline those that were recovered to leave the
Hospital. Whilst they are Sick, they are
kept strictly to the Rules the Physicians Ap∣point
concerning them, who direct the quan∣tity
and quality of their Meat and Drink;
<PB N="287" REF="156"/>
which they execute with a punctuality that is
to admiration. Afterwards, when the Physi∣cians
declare that they are wholly Cured, they
continue them there still for Three Weeks,
and they are Treated Morning and Evening
with all sorts of delicate Viands, boyl'd and
roasted; and serv'd with the choicest Fruits
and best Wine, in such a quantity, as may
most contribute to the strengthning and nou∣rishing
of them, without doing them any
prejudice. At the end of the Three Weeks,
those that want Cloaths have them bestow'd
upon them, and a piece of Mony besides;
and so are sent away. By this means there
is never a Poor Patient in the Hospital, but
wisheth, that this Three Weeks time were
come for him too, to be so Nobly Entertain'd:
And by this means, they are put to no trouble,
to discharge their Hospital of those who are
Recovered.</P>
<P>The Great Hospital of <HI>Milan,</HI> and some
others of <HI>Italy,</HI> are almost Administred after
the same manner. I could wish the <HI>Italians</HI>
would be advised, not to trust their Charities
to Priests and Monks, so much as they do,
who, for the most part, have the most pity∣less
and inhuman Hearts that can be: For
indeed this is a Curse which God pours forth
upon them, for being the Authors of so
many Idolatrous Practices and Profanations
they are guilty of; to give them a Heart as
herd and unrelenting, as that of <HI>Pharaoh.</HI>
<PB N="288" REF="157"/>
They would do much better, to take the
pains of distributing their Alms themselves;
because we find, that in those Places where
they do so, things are managed in so noble
and generous a manner.</P>
<P>Having taken a View of the Hospital of
<HI>Naples,</HI> I spent some part of my time to go
and see the Fair Churches of that great and
stately City; which indeed are such, that
nothing can be seen more Rich, Magnificent,
or Beautiful: There is scarely the least Parish
Church, which is not all Gilt and Painted
from the top to the bottom. All the Altars
and Chapels are built of Precious Stones; and
there is never a Church, but hath Silver-Candlesticks,
Basons, and Lamps in great
numbers, without counting the Shrines and
Cases for their Relicks and their Crosses,
that for the most part are of pure Gold:
Which made a Vice-Roy of <HI>Naples</HI> say, <HI>That
if all the Churches of that City were made into
One, and that all their Riches made up but One
Treasury, it would by far surpass in Beauty and
Riches the very Temple of</HI> Solomon; <HI>and that
by this means, there might be seen at this Day,
to the Honour of the</HI> Neapolitans, <HI>something more
glorious, than was that which in past Ages had
been the Admiration of all the World.</HI> For my
part, I do truly believe, that in making this
Imaginary Union of the Churches of <HI>Naples,</HI>
it would by far surpass in sumptuousness the
<PB N="289" REF="157"/>
same Union we might conceive of all the
Churches of <HI>Rome.</HI> Yet must we not conclude
from hence, that therefore the <HI>Neapolitans</HI> are
the better Men; God having made it appear
two or three years ago, that he cares little for
these Material Temples, by permitting the
most part of all those fair and sumptuous
Churches, to be overthrown by a dreadful
Earthquake.</P>
<P>It would be much better in my Opinion,
to take away all the superfluous Ornaments of
Churches, and to turn them into a Stock,
for the Entertainment of the Poor of the
Parish, who are the Temples of the Holy
Ghost, than to study Night and Day, to
embelish Pillars and Dead-Walls. This with∣out
doubt would be much more pleasing to
God, than all the fair and stately Fabricks
that could be built. It is sufficient, that the
Places where we Meet to worship God, be
decently Adorn'd, without any thing of su∣perfluous
Costliness, and convenient for the
Faithful that Assemble there; but it is the
holding forth of a false Notion of Religion,
to go about to persuade Christians, as the
Popish-Priests endeavour to do, <HI>That the more
lustrous and dazelling their Churches are with
Gold, Silver, and Precious Stones; the more abun∣dantly
the Holy Ghost pours forth of his Graces
and Blessings on them.</HI> One of the fairest and
most sumptuous Churches of <HI>Naples,</HI> was that
of the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> save only that the Length of
<PB N="290" REF="158"/>
it was not answerable to the Breadth of it;
and yet all Rich and Beautiful as it was, we
see the late Earthquake took no pity of it,
but in a manner totally overthrew it. This
probably will give an occasion to the Fathers,
to build another more proportionable, and
probably also more Rich and more Magni∣ficent.</P>
<P>All manner of Monks and Religious live
generally very richly and plentifully at <HI>Naples,</HI>
and all of them have many Monasteries and
Convents there of their own Order; but
none of them all are more Rich and Power∣ful,
than the <HI>Jesuits;</HI> they are they that have
all the Nobility at command, who do no∣thing
without them: 'Tis by their means
Men get into Places and Offices: There are
no Matches made, which they have not a
hand in; yea, they stoop so low, as to take
care of furnishing them with Men and Maid-Servants.
And indeed there is more Policy
in this last Point, than one would imagine.
We must not be so weak to think their Cha∣rity
puts them upon these kind of Services,
but rather their own Interest; for by this
means they have constant Intelligence of
whatsoever passeth in all Families, and are
sure of a Party, who will dispose all things
in favour of them, upon occasion. But if the
Persons thus placed, should chance in the least
to disoblige them, as they have found the
means of getting them in, so they will soon
<PB N="291" REF="158"/>
find a way to turn them out again: Which
makes, That these Servants, for the most
part, had rather betray their own Masters,
than to hazard the displeasure of the <HI>Jesuits;</HI>
as being assured, That if their Masters, at the
worst, should come to discover their False∣ness,
that the <HI>Jesuits</HI> will either make their
Peace, or do their endeavour to seek out for
them another Condition, that may be more
for their Advantage. But if they should
chance to offend the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> they had as
good go out of the World. All the <HI>Jesuits</HI>
of <HI>Italy,</HI> for some Years since, have followed
the Model the Fathers of <HI>Naples</HI> have given
them, to place Servants and Maids; and
generally all those that have a mind to enter
upon any Service whatsoever. Insomuch,
that People go and Address themselves to the
<HI>Jesuits</HI> there, as here in <HI>London</HI> they go to
the Offices of Intelligence, with this distin∣ction
only, That instead of giving a piece of
Mony, they oblige themselves, to be their
Slaves for ever.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding all this great Access
the <HI>Jesuits</HI> have every where, and that they
are so Rich and Potent; yet it may be also
with Truth affirmed, that they are at this
day generally hated of all the World. The
Princes and Grandees have no further esteem
for them, but as they fear to hazard the
ruining of their Affairs, should they once
offer to disoblige them; but at the bottom,
<PB N="292" REF="159"/>
and in truth, they love them not. The
Common People also are very weary of
seeing themselves reduced to Slavery, under
the insolent Domination of the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> who
Command them in the most Imperious and
Servile manner that can be: And generally
all sorts of Priests, Monks, and Religious, hate
them mortally, as being their greatest Ene∣mies;
and a sort of People, that carry it
towards them with Loftiness and Disdain,
who have already deprived them of a great
part of their Temporal Revenues, and who
probably will find themselves strong enough
one day, to invade all the rest. Some very
Intelligent Persons have Cast the Account,
that they have already usurped near one half
of the Goods belonging to the Order of
S. <HI>Bennet.</HI> They make Kings and Princes
to grant them whatsoever they please, and
they are continually begging some Abbies
or Priories of S. <HI>Bennet,</HI> either to make Col∣leges
of them, or to unite them to their
Profest Houses. What is more, they make
themselves Masters of, and invade them with
the extreamest Insolence.</P>
<P>I had a Letter shewn me once, which the
Father Rector of the College of the <HI>Jesuits</HI>
of <HI>Clermont</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> writ to the Father
Prior of the Abby of S. <HI>Benignus</HI> of <HI>Dijon,</HI>
upon account of the Priory of <HI>Laris,</HI> which
did belong to those Fathers, who are <HI>Bene∣dictins,</HI>
<PB N="293" REF="159"/>
and which the <HI>Jesuits</HI> had a mind to
get for themselves; which runs thus:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Reverend Father,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have thought good to Unite the Priory
of <HI>Laris,</HI> which depends on your Abby,
to our College of <HI>Clermont,</HI> to augment the Re∣venues
thereof: And forasmuch as the Consent of
your Community is necessary for this, we doubt
not but you will shew all readiness in giving the
same. You know that Father <HI>de la Chaisse</HI> con∣cerns
himself in this Matter, and the Power he
hath at Court, ought to affright you, from incur∣ring
his Indignation by your Refusal; so that we
hope, that all things on your side will correspond
with our Wishes.</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>My Reverend Father,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your, &amp;c.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The <HI>Benedictins</HI> of this Abby having called a
Chapter, consulted what was best to be done;
but were so terrified with this Threatning
Letter of the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> that they basely and
cowardly consented, that that great Priory
should be dismembred from their Abby, and
Incorporated with the College of <HI>Clermont,</HI>
as it is at present.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jesuits</HI> are like to Drones, who enter
upon the Labours of others, and eat the Bees
Hony: They are the last come into the
<PB N="294" REF="160"/>
Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and yet they are the first
in Power, in numbers of Houses, and in
Riches. The great number of Colleges they
have, surpasseth all belief.</P>
<P>And now I am speaking of their Colleges,
it brings to my mind a very ingenious Epi∣gram
which one of their Scholars made at
<HI>Dola</HI> in <HI>Burgundy,</HI> upon occasion of their
taking Possession of a College which they
have there, and is called <HI>l' Arc,</HI> or <HI>the Bow.</HI>
The <HI>Jesuit,</HI> who was the Rhetorick Regent,
told his Scholars, That they knew very well
that the Famous College of <HI>la Flesche,</HI> in
<HI>Flanders,</HI> belonged to the Fathers of the So∣ciety;
and that now, by a wonderful and
Divine Providence, the Magistrate of <HI>Dola</HI>
had bestowed upon them the <HI>Piazza</HI> and
fair Buildings of <HI>l' Arc;</HI> wherefore his Will
was, That they should endeavour every one
of them, to make an Epigram upon this so
happy an Encounter, proposing a Reward to
him that should best acquit himself of the
Task. They accordingly, all of them, set
their Wits upon the Rack to produce something
more than ordinary upon so rare a Subject.
Some flatter'd them, That with this their
<HI>Bow</HI> and <HI>Arrow</HI> (for this is the English of
<HI>l' Arc &amp; la Flesche)</HI> they would sooner or later
subjugate the World: Others applying it to
their Doctrin, said, That the <HI>Bow</HI> by its
strength represented the Solidity of it, and
the piercing Point of the <HI>Arrow,</HI> the Subtilty
<PB N="295" REF="160"/>
thereof: Others, that were greater Liars than
the rest, or it may be also to Laugh at them
in their Sleeves, said, That the Piety and
Vertue of the <HI>Jesuits</HI> lifted them up to Hea∣ven,
as the <HI>Bow</HI> doth the <HI>Arrow.</HI> But the
most happy and lucky Wit of all was his,
who made this most excellent pat Distick:
<Q><L>Arcum <HI>Dola</HI> dedit Patribus, dedit Alma Sagit∣tam</L>
<L><HI>Gallia;</HI> quis Funem quem meruere dabit?</L></Q>
<Q><L>Fair <HI>France</HI> the Arrow, <HI>Dola</HI> gave the Bow;</L>
<L>Who shall the String, so well deserv'd, bestow?</L></Q>
It's without Controversie, that the Scholar
who made this, had best deserved the pro∣mised
Recompence; but instead thereof he
was shamefully expell'd the College. For my
part, I wish neither Halter nor Death to
these Fathers, only I could wish, from a
Spirit of Christian Charity, that they would
once seriously think of changing their Evil
Ways, and that they would not drag along
with them, as they do, so many Thousands
down the way of Perdition. Or at least, I
could heartily wish, they would give over the
Profaning the Holy Name of JESUS, by
appropriating it to themselves. Of all the
Popes that the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> has had, there is
not one to be found, that ever durst take to
himself the Name of S. <HI>Peter,</HI> out of the
<PB N="296" REF="161"/>
respect they had to that Apostle; and yet
these Wretches have had the Effrontery, to
take to themselves that of our Adorable Sa∣viour,
insomuch that I cannot name the
Name of JESUS, but these Wretches imme∣diately
come to my mind. Yea, they are
the cause, why many People whom they give
occasion to Curse them, pronounce that Holy
Name most Irreverently, mingling it with
the wicked Words and Revilings they be∣stow
upon.</P>
<P>I don't pretend to any thing of a Pro∣phet;
yet durst I almost venture to Prog∣nosticate
thus much, That like as this Order
of the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> hath in a very short time
raised it self to a prodigious Greatness, so it
won't be long, before it take a Fall equal
to its Elevation. Its own weight shall sink
it, <HI>Mole ruet suâ,</HI> and its Ruin shall drag the
Dissolution of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> along with
it. For then Peoples Eyes will be opened, to
see how shamefully they have been abused
and gull'd by a Company of Men, who
pretending to be the Pillars of the Church,
and professing the outside of Vertue, reje∣cted
the Substance thereof. God grant that
Atheism may not thrive by the approaching
Wreck of that Church; but that all at that
time may terminate in a holy Reformation,
whereof the Church of <HI>England</HI> hath already
given so perfect a Model.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="161"/>
The Jesuits are they who have the fairest
and richest Churches not only at <HI>Naples,</HI> but
also throughout almost all the other parts of
<HI>Italy;</HI> and they are also the best Men of the
World, according to the Sense I have already
explained. After having taken a view of
their Colleges and Churches in this Noble
City, I had a favourable occasion offered me,
of seeing the Relicks of S. <HI>Januarius,</HI> which
are kept in the Cathedral, and where the
<HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks boast of having a perpetual
Miracle: For they shew you a Vial full of
Blood, averring it to be that of S. <HI>January,</HI>
which as soon as it is brought near to his
Body, turns to Liquor. The Reverend Do∣ctor
<HI>Burnet,</HI> now Bishop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> has, in
his Letters, given us his Opinion concerning
this Relick, which is very probable. As for
my part, tho' I was a Priest of the Church
of <HI>Rome,</HI> yet they did not so far Honour me,
as to let me handle the Vial, that con∣tains
the Blood, notwithstanding my earnest∣ness
to obtain that favour. This indeed
made me somewhat Suspicious of the Relick;
for if a Priest hath the Power and Authority
of handling the Body of Jesus Christ in the
Eucharist after Consecration, he may very well,
I should think, be allow'd to touch all other
sorts of Relicks, which are so far inferiour to
that. I imagined therefore, and not without
reason, that there might be some Concavities
in the Glass, which contain'd a reddish Li∣quor,
<PB N="298" REF="162"/>
which the Priests, who knew the Trick
of it, could when ever they pleas'd, cause to
be diffused over the middle of the Glass.
They declare to all Persons that come to see
this Relick, that a Heretick was once Con∣verted
at the sight of this Miracle; so
that here is now a Second Miracle pro∣duced,
to confirm and prove the first.</P>
<P>I saw since at <HI>Milan,</HI> a Minister of <HI>Ge∣neva,</HI>
who was turned Papist at <HI>Turin,</HI> and
after that he had Travelled over all <HI>Italy,</HI>
and amongst the rest had seen the Relick
of S. <HI>January;</HI> I asked him, What he
thought of it? He desired me in the Name
of God, not to speak to him about it, for
fear it should raise those thoughts in him,
that might encline him to turn Heretick a∣gain:
For he told me, that when the Priests
were about to shew it him, they fell into
the greatest Confusion imaginable, because
the Spring of the Machin, would not Play;
but at last they shak'd the Bottle so long,
till they made a shift to shew him something,
that was Reddish and Liquid. He added
that another Minister, who had abjur'd with
him at <HI>Turin,</HI> and who was there at the same
time present with him, protested to him, at
their coming out of the Church, that for
his part he had seen enough, and was re∣solv'd
to return to <HI>Geneva.</HI> So that we see
here a Saint that is an Ambo-dexter, and
Works Miracles both ways, by making Pro∣testants,
<PB N="299" REF="162"/>
turn Papists, and the Papists, Pro∣testants.
The same Gentleman protested to
me, that if he had no other Reasons to be∣lieve
the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Religion, that
Miracle would never have had the Efficacy,
to persuade him of the Truth of it, as they
pretended it had done others.</P>
<P>I had also another Question to ask of this
New-Papist, which was, <HI>How the Hereticks
liv'd at Geneva?</HI> Because being a New-Con∣vert,
and having been a Minister there, I
hoped he would discover something Extraor∣dinary
concerning their Practices. He told
me, that he could not tell me of any Super∣stititious
Practice that they had, nor of any
Fraud or wicked Action, that they Commit∣ted,
to Engage the People to their Party;
and that almost all their publick Acts of
Religion, consisted in these four things; the
Reading of the Holy Scripture, the Singing
of Psalms, Preaching, and Celebrating the
Lord's Supper. I prayed him also to tell me
sincerely, <HI>Whether what I had heard reported
of them, from my first Youth, were true or no?</HI>
viz. <HI>that they have the Figure of a Devil in
their Churches? and that as soon as the Sermon
is Ended, all the</HI> Hugonots <HI>went and Prostra∣ted
themselves before it, and Worship'd it?</HI>
(This is that Story the <HI>Jesuits</HI> so often tell
to their Scolars, in their Schools, to inspire
them with Horror against the Hereticks;)
His Answer was, that it was a very great Lie,
<PB N="300" REF="163"/>
and that the <HI>Hugonots</HI> had so great an Aver∣sion
for all sorts of Images in their Churches,
that they never suffer'd any to be there;
neither of God, nor of the Angels, nor of
the Saints, nor of the Devil. So that it seems
he could tell me nothing, that might give me
any Disesteem for the Protestants; but on
the contrary, he very much Diminished the
false Idea, they had given me of them. He
only declared, that the sole Reason that
had inclin'd him to leave them was, because
he believed their Doctrin not to be Sound,
and that they put a false Interpretation on the
Scriptures. In a word, he did not believe,
said he, that their Divinity was good. But
indeed he could not say less, to make Men
believe he was a Papist.</P>
<P>I have since made this Reflection, that it
is some kind of Proof of the true Religion,
when those who leave it, have nothing to
object against the Manners or Practices of
those who profess it. I defie a Protestant that
leaves the Church of <HI>England,</HI> to turn Papist,
to Ridicule or Disapprove the least Ceremo∣ny
that is practised in the same; for should
he do this, he must either Scoff at the Preach∣ing
of the Word, or the Common Prayers,
or the singing of Psalms, or at the Commu∣nion,
and this is that they cannot do, because
these are Acts of Religion, which are practi∣sed
in the said Church, with an Exemplary
Devotion, and without any Superstition at all.
<PB N="301" REF="163"/>
But the Case is not the same, with those who
Abandon the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> for they can
tell you a thousand things that are in Vogue
there, the bare Relation of which, without
any the least change or exaggeration, can∣not
but excite the Disesteem or Indignati∣on
of honest and good Men.</P>
<P>But to return again to <HI>Naples;</HI> after having
Visited the Churches and Relicks, I had the
Curiosity one Evening, to go and take a
Walk before the Haven, where three of the
Pope's Gallies were Arriv'd that day, and I
entred into all three of them, to see how
the poor Gally-Slaves were treated there.
I must acknowledge that my Heart was not
Stanch enough to resist the Motions of Com∣passion
at so pitiful a Spectacle. The Inhu∣mane
Cruelty of the Masters that beat them,
surpasseth a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y thing I can tell you of it.
I could not conceive how Christians, could
have the Heart, to handle with so much Ri∣gour,
those who were their Brethren in
Christ. 'True it is, I represented to my
self, that all these were miserable Wretches,
that had been Condemned for their Crimes,
and that Crimes were to be Punished.</P>
<P>As I was entertaining my self with these
sad Thoughts, I cast my Eyes upon Three
of them, who seemed to me to be New-Comers,
and who were all fastned to the
same Bench. One of these Three hid his
Face with his Hands, and another of them
<PB N="302" REF="164"/>
Beckned me to come to him. As soon as I
was come near, he asked me, Whether I did
not know him? I could not of a sudden call
him to mind, because they had cut his Hair;
and besides, his Gally-Slaves Habit had much
disguis'd him: But having Ey'd him with
more attention, I knew him to be a Person,
who had been the Steward of a Cardinal at
<HI>Rome.</HI> He told me, <HI>That the two others, who
were of each side of him, were Monks, who had
left their Monasteries, and had lived sometime at</HI>
Rome <HI>Incognito, under a Secular Garb.</HI> The
Steward told me, <HI>He had been Accused, of
having wish'd for the Death of his Master; and
the Cardinal sometime after having found him∣self
a little Indisposed, he firmly believ'd, That
his Steward had Poyson'd him.</HI> They assured
me, all Three of them, That they had been
discovered, or rather betray'd by means of
their Confession.</P>
<P>No Body at <HI>Rome</HI> knew, that these Two
unhappy Wretches were Monks; only the
Humor took one of them, to go to discover
himself in Confession, and to make mention
also of his Companion; and the very next
Day they were both of them seized and sent
to the Gallies, withou telling them why, or
for what. As for the Steward, he told me,
<HI>It was but a few Days since, that he had Con∣fessed
the secret Hatred he had against his
Master; and his Confessor, who was always
very Welcom at the Cardinal's House, had Informed
<PB N="303" REF="164"/>
him thereof; which made him interpret a small
Fit of the Colick, he had soon after, to be an
effect of the Poyson his Steward had given him;
and that upon this Cruel and Ill-grounded-Suspicion,
he sent him, whom he supposed to be the Author
of it, to the Gallies.</HI> They all Three of them
wish'd earnestly, That the Gally in which
they were, might be shatter'd to pieces
against some Rock or other, or sink-down to
rights in the Sea, forasmuch as Death would
prove much more acceptable to them, than
the Slavery to which they were reduc'd: But
they protested, That if by any other more
happy Accident they ever came to be set at
Liberty, they would never hear of Con∣fessing
any more, nor of a pretended Secret,
which was never kept, and for which they now
paid so dearly.</P>
<P>This had led us to a Point which is of a
very large extent, and wherein the Papists
make one of the chief Parts of their Reli∣gion
to consist, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Confession of Sins.</HI>
Of all the Practices that in process of time
have been introduc'd into the Church of
<HI>Rome,</HI> there is none at which I am more
astonished, than at this, and wherein the
Artifice of the Monks and Priests hath been
more subtilly employ'd. There is nothing
more pleasing to the World, than to know
the most secret Thoughts, and the very bot∣tom
of Mens Hearts; but on the other hand,
neither is there any thing which Men are
<PB N="304" REF="165"/>
more loath to impart to others, because of
the Ill use may be made of it. The Angels
take an unutterable pleasure mutually to com∣municate
their Thoughts, and reciprocally
to receive this knowledge from each other;
forasmuch as being confirmed in Grace, they
cannot hurt one another. But the Nature of
Man, since the miserable Fall of <HI>Adam,</HI> is so
extreamly corrupted, and his inclination to
Evil is so great, that a man that should speak
all he thinks, and all that he does, would
expose himself to a thousand Dangers: Which
is the Reason why Secrecy, which in the
state of Innocency would have prov'd very
useless, is at this time, in this state of
Corruption, become a necessary Vertue;
as being a main ground of his security and
safety.</P>
<P>But let us suppose, that a Person had the
power to penetrate into the Thoughts and
Hearts of others, how great an Advantage
might he draw thence, to further his own
Affairs? For if this Person were of an Am∣bitious
Humor, it would be enough for him,
by his knowledge of other Mens Thoughts,
to Address himself to such Men, as he knew
might be easily gain'd to endeavour his Ele∣vation.
If he was Covetous, he would only
Converse with those whom he knew to be
of a Liberal Heart, and whom he might
easily persuade to gratifie him. If he were
addicted to sensual and infamous Pleasures,
<PB N="305" REF="165"/>
he might, without ever fearing a Repulse,
confidently apply himself to those who had
the most Lustful Inclinations. A Revengful
Person needed only to betake himself to those
who were of a Bloody and Inhuman Temper,
to make them the Executors of his Revenge.
A General of an Army would not stand in
need of Spies; but knowing all the Designs
of his Enemy, he would be thereby Instructed
how to order his own Actions and Conduct;
he might always be sure of his Blow, and
could never be taken at a Surprize. Besides,
what a pleasure and diversion it would be to
him, to tickle his Fancy with a thousand
Maggots and foolish Thoughts, which conti∣nually
flutter in the Heads of most Men, and
which would be no less divertizing, than
the most merry Comedies and ridiculous
Farces.</P>
<P>In a word, having considered all, we may
well assert, That nothing would either be
more pleasant or profitable, than this inti∣mate
Knowledge of the Thoughts of Mens
Hearts. And this is the very thing the Priests
and Monks of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> have in
some sort procur'd to themselves by means of
their <HI>Auricular Confession,</HI> as they are pleas'd
to call it. To bring about this Advantagious
Design, they make use of the 23th Verse of
the XXth Chapter of S. <HI>John; Whosoever Sins
ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and who∣soever
Sins ye retain, they are retained:</HI> And
<PB N="306" REF="166"/>
of Verse <HI>16th</HI> of the Fifth Chapter of the
Epistle of S. <HI>James; Confess your Faults one to
another:</HI> The former of which Texts they In∣terpret
concerning the Power, they pretend
to have been given them, to pardon Sins; and
the other, of that Auricular Confession, which
they pretend must be made to the Priests.
At the first, they Confessed their Sins only in
General; or if they specified any, they were
such as had been Publick, and had given
Scandal to others; but, by little and little,
they have obliged Persons to Confess their
most Secret Sins, and that with all the most
particular Circumstances thereto belonging.
Nay, besides all this, they will have Persons
Confess to them, all their Evil Inclinations;
that is to say, they will know where the
Strength or Weakness of a Person lies, before
he shall get out of their Hands.</P>
<P>The first Question they make to you at
Confession is, Who you are? Your Quality,
Condition, and Way of Living? Afterwards,
they ask, What you have done; the Place
where you committed the Sin; the Means and
Instruments you have made use of, to put it
in execution; the End you had in doing it;
the Manner of your Committing it; at what
Time, and with whom you have Sinned; and
how often you have Committed the same
Sin? In a word, a dextrous Confessor knows
so well how to search and sift his Penitent,
that nothing shall escape his Scrutiny.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="166"/>
I should certainly make the Papists Blush,
should I begin to relate here the Confession
of their Whores, and what Questions the
Priests put to them; but I bless God, I have
not Impudence enough to undertake it; and
I should be very loath, to blot the Paper with
what the Priests and Monks of the Church of
<HI>Rome,</HI> make no Bones to mingle with their
Sacrament of <HI>Penance.</HI> I shall only tell you,
That the avidity and eagerness wherewith the
Priests shew themselves carried, to the Con∣fessing
of those that are of the Female Sex,
make it very apparent, how much Pleasure
they take in putting Questions to them, and
Hearing of their Answers. They will dis∣patch
a Man's Confession in less than Half an
Hours time; but if they have got a Handsom-Woman
to Task, they will keep her in a
Confessional-Chat two or three Hours toge∣ther.</P>
<P>I shall never forget a Stratagem, some
<HI>Jesuits</HI> Scholars made use of, to Tole their
Father Confessor to the Confessing-Chair.
The <HI>Jesuits</HI> oblige their Scholars, to Confess
themselves every Holy-day or Festival in the
Year, and that under the Penalty of being
Whipt, in case of Neglect; so that they per∣form
this Duty rather out of Fear of Punish∣ment,
than from any Spirit of Penitence and
Devotion. In the mean time the Confessors,
who are appointed to take their Confessions,
are not at all earnest to discharge that
<PB N="308" REF="167"/>
Function; but let their Penitents lie often four
or five Hours on their Knees in the Church,
before ever they come at them. The Scholars
had agreed to Play a Match at Tennice, as
soon as they should be dismist from Confession,
but did not know by what means to get
themselves dispatch'd. The Fathers Confessors
were all Playing at Bowls in their Garden,
and as often as any of the Scholars came to
ask for them, they were sent away with this
Answer, That <HI>the Fathers were engaged in
Meditation.</HI> At last, as they were pumping
for something that might relieve them, they
call'd to mind, that a pretty young Woman,
called <HI>Alison,</HI> spent almost every Day three or
four Hours in the Confessional with the Father
Rector; whereupon they deputed one of their
Company, to go and tell him, <HI>That Madam</HI>
Alison <HI>waited for him at the Confessional.</HI> The
Father immediately left his Game at Bowls,
and ran all in a Sweat to his Confessional;
where he found none but this Troop of young
Scholars, whom he did not much care to
Confess. Wherefore to rid himself of them,
he dispatch'd them a Great Benediction,
telling them, <HI>That he knew already what they
had to say, and that they had nothing but some
Scholars Sins to Confess to him, which did not
once deserve a Formal Absolution;</HI> and so sent
them away very well satisfied with his quick
Riddance. However, considering with how
much Expedition he had dismist them, they
<PB N="309" REF="167"/>
said to one another; <HI>Well, certainly we have
great Reason to Bless God, that we have not so
many Sins to Confess, as Madam</HI> Alison <HI>has;
for otherwise he would not have made an end
of Confessing us all, till to Morrow Morn∣ing.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis in these Confessionals, that the Priests
and Monks do Court their Mistresses. I once
chanc'd to find in one of the Sides of a Con∣fessional,
an Amorous Letter, which an <HI>Italian</HI>
Monk had writ to his Lady. An Old Woman,
who was come on purpose to Confession, to
receive the said Letter, had by Mischance
dropt it, as she came out of the Confessional.
The Letter was full of Wit: He told her,
<HI>That the greatest Sin she ever had committed in
her Life-time was, that she had not been so good
as her Word in coming to Confession that Week:
If this Neglect did proceed from the difficulty she
found to Love him, he had a Penance ready Cut
out for her; which was to Command her to Love
him better.</HI> I don't remember the rest of the
Letter; only thus much I can tell you, that
it was stuft with nothing but Flourishes and
Love, and there was no Name subscrib'd to
it.</P>
<P>Those who have a quick Ear, and draw
near to these Confessionals, do often hear
pretty Stories. There sometimes happen great
Tumults in the Convents, and amongst the
Priests, upon the account of young Women
Penitents: For if any of them do chance to
<PB N="310" REF="168"/>
change their Confessor, this Alteration causeth
great Jealousies, which many times are not
extinguish'd, but by Poyson, or with the
Blood of one of the Competitors; for they
presently interpret it, as if the other Con∣fessor,
had by his Artifices allured, and (as it
were) debauched his Penitent.</P>
<P>A Father <HI>Jesuit,</HI> very Famous for his Ser∣mons
at <HI>Mentz</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> desired me to
make his Peace with a Gentlewoman of Qua∣lity,
who, for some time, had left off coming
to Confession to him. The Lady told me,
<HI>That she was astonished, to hear the Father talk
of making his Peace with her; that for her part,
she had never had any the least Quarrel with
him; and that the only Reason, why she had not
Confest to him of late was, because it was more
for her Convenience to go to the</HI> Carmelites, <HI>as
being nearer to her House.</HI> When I return'd
this Answer to the <HI>Jesuit,</HI> his Colour chang'd
of a sudden, and he appear'd to be in a
strange agitation of Spirit. In a word, a Fe∣ver
seiz'd him the same Night, and the Cha∣ritable
Lady, for fear of giving any occasion
to his Death, sent him word, <HI>That she would
come and Confess to him for time to come.</HI></P>
<P>The greatest Secret they have to allure La∣dies
to Confession is, to be very Complaisant
to them, to sooth them with a company of
sweet Words, to testifie their loving of them
Tenderly, and from the Bottom of their
Hearts. Sometimes they find it very trou∣blesom
<PB N="311" REF="168"/>
at first, to make them Confess as
they ought, that is, Clearly and Plainly with∣out
any mincing of the Matter, and with all
the Circumstances of some shameful Sins, and
especially those of the Flesh. They are fain
to take a great Compass, to bring them to
the Point, they would have them at; but by
little and little, and a great deal of Pains-taking,
they at last weather the Point, and make
them Impudent enough. Then it is they
assure them, that they are Arriv'd at that Sim∣plicity,
Purity, and Faithfulness, which are
of such absolute Necessity, for the well Dis∣charging
of the Duty of Confession. Hence
it is that those Women who mostly frequent
the Confessionals, and who are Arriv'd to
that degree of Perfection, I just now men∣tioned,
that is, to be less shamefac'd than the
rest, become also the most bold and shameless
in all Companies. They are got past Blush∣ing
at any thing, and with a great deal of
Freedom, make use of those Terms their
Confessors have taught them at their Confessi∣ons.
I upon a time exprest my self not over
well satisfied with the Discourse, which some
Devout or Bigotted Young Woman, had in
the Presence of two Young Counts of the
Empire, whose Governour I was. I took
the liberty to tell them, that it did not be∣come
them; but they with a terrible Impu∣dence,
which yet was accompanied with
some little Smartness of Wit, answered me,
<PB N="312" REF="169"/>
that they did not believe that they had spo∣ken
so unhandsomly, but that they were
ready to repeat the same Words in Confessi∣on.
Indeed they have made it a School of
Impudence and Lascivious Discourse, where
those that speak Broadest, and call a Spade,
a Spade, receive the greatest Praises. They
are not afraid to tell them; Courage Madam,
the more clearly, and in the more proper
Terms you do express your Self, by so much
the more will you shew your Sincerity to
God, who hears you, and the better I shall
like you. To Facilitate this the more, they
have these Words writ on their Confessionals
with great Letters, <HI>GOD HEARS THEE.</HI> It is
a thing that will Surprize a Man to see young
Girls amongst the Papists, that know those
things which they ought, by right, to be
ignorant of all their Life time, and all this
by means of Confession.</P>
<P>It is a matter of great Advantage to be the
Confessor of Ladies, and the more one can
get of them, the more Charitable Nurses one
may be assur'd of, who will never suffer a
Man to want any thing, they can furnish him
with. They from time to time send Presents
to their Confessors, which do make them full
amends for all their Pains, they have taken in
hearing their Confessions. Moreover the
Confessions are very gainful to the Priests, by
reason of the Pecuniary Penances they impose
upon them, for their Sins. There is always
<PB N="313" REF="169"/>
a Trunk or Box at the lower end of their
Churches, whereof they are the Turn-Keys,
and according as they know the Person to be
Stocked with Riches, they command him
for his Penance to go and put such a Sum
into the Trunk. We gather'd once five hun∣dred
Crowns on one of the <HI>Easter</HI> Holy-days,
in a Parish at <HI>Venice,</HI> and the next day we
divided the Mony amongst Eight of us, who
had been the Confessors. The Custom a∣mongst
them is, when any Covetous Man
comes to Confession, to represent to him his
Sin, in the blackest Colours they can Possible;
and afterwards to give him good Words, to
Sweeten him, and incline him to Liberality;
if thereupon he Testifie great Sorrow for his
Sin, they never give him Absolution, till he
have given some Sound Marks of his Repen∣tance,
by dropping a very plentiful Alms into
the Trunk: And if he shew any hardness of
Heart, yet they Absolve him nevertheless,
for fear of Distasting him altogether with
Confession; because they are in hopes to find
him another time in a better Humour, and
better dispos'd for Repentance. When
Thieves and Robbers, Usurers, and those
that use false Weights and Measures, come
to Confession, they oblige them, as they
ought, to make Restitution, as far as it lies in
their Power so to do. They enjoyn those
who are not able to make a Personal Re∣stitution,
that is, to the Persons they have
<PB N="314" REF="170"/>
Defrauded, either because they are Dead,
or because they do not know where they
are; these I say they enjoyn to make Re∣stitution
to the Church, that is, to put an
Equivalent Sum into the Trunk. As for Per∣sonal
Restitutions, they are commonly per∣form'd
by the Hand of the Confessor, to the
End that the Penitent, who must be Con∣cealed,
may not come into any Danger, as
he would, should he do it himself, of falling
into the Hands of Justice. And in this case
there always comes a considerable part of the
Sum to the Churches share, which he that
was Robb'd can never recover.</P>
<P>A <HI>Neapolitan</HI> Knight was Robb'd of two
Thousand Crowns in Coin, at the time of a
<HI>Jubilee,</HI> granted by Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> the XIth. He
who had committed the Robbery, went and
Confest himself to the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> and put all
the Mony into the Hands of the Father
Rector, who had heard his Confession, to
restore it to the Gentleman to whom it did
belong. The <HI>Jesuits</HI> put Five hundred
Crowns of it into their Trunk, and carried
the rest to the Knight, but he refus'd to take
the One Thousand Five hundred Crowns, and
would have the whole Sum restor'd to him.
The <HI>Jesuits</HI> after some Endeavours to per∣suade
him to receive his Mony, declar'd to
him, that in case he would not take it be∣fore
twice Twenty Four hours came about,
they would cast the rest into the Trunk also,
<PB N="315" REF="170"/>
and that he should not have one Peny of
it. And they were as good as their words.
But the Knight repenting himself some days
after, came and told them, that since it could
be no otherwise, he would content himself
with the One Thousand Five hundred Crowns
of his Mony. But the <HI>Jesuits</HI> flowted at
him, telling him, That he was come too late,
and there was no Remedy, because the
Church was in actual Possession of the Mo∣ny;
thus it was impossible for the Gentleman
to recover any part of it. This word <HI>of the
Church,</HI> which they make use of, when they
say, the Mony is given to the Church, the
Church is in Possession of it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is only a
fine word to deceive the Simple: For the
Church in the Sense, they take it, is a thing
in the Air, and indeed they are the Priests
and Monks only that possess the Mony, and
make use of it for themselves.</P>
<P>Some believe that Confession, as it is practi∣sed
in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> is a very pro∣per
means to remedy many Disorders, and to
prevent a great many Sins, which if that
were Abrogated, many would make more
bold with: For, say they, many are restrain'd
from committing a bad Action, from the
shame they have to Confess it afterwards
The Papists will tell you, that the Protest∣tants
reject this Sacrament, because they
love Libertinism, and hate all manner of re∣straint,
and any thing that may serve to hum∣ble
<PB N="316" REF="171"/>
them. As for my part, who have tried
both States, without flattering the Party I
have chosen, I do profess, That I have observ'd
more of Honesty, of Conscience, and of
Vertue, in the External part of a Civil Life,
amongst the Protestants, than ever I found
amongst the Papists, with all their Confessions.
As for that which is Internal, 'tis God alone
that can judge of it: And I hope, that the
Fear of God, and of his Judgments, does
bring forth far more Noble Effects in their
Hearts, than a Human Shamefac'dness doth
produce in those who follow the Communion
of <HI>Rome.</HI> Besides, I conceive that Auricular
Confession may be rather prejudicial, than
any way advantagious to a Christian Life,
which I prove thus: Bad Company and Vain
Conversation are prohibited, because they
are commonly known to corrupt good Man∣ners:
<Q>Corrumpunt bonos mores Colloquia prava.</Q>
Now we may truly say, That the Priests and
the Monks of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> are every
day, whilst they are in their Confessionals, in
very lewd Company, as where they hear
nothing but Blasphemies, lewd Practices, Vil∣lanies,
Treasons, Robberies, Murthers, Revenge;
In a word, whatsoever is superlatively Wicked
and Infamous. They in some sort familiarize
themselves with such abominable Filthiness, by
the continual hearing of them, and the re∣iterated
<PB N="317" REF="171"/>
Examples thereof, which they have
almost continually before them, makes the
Confessors accustom themselves by degrees with
them, and to have less horrour for them, and
commit them with less reluctancy. The
Clergy being thus corrupted by the Seculars,
do as it were in Revenge influence a double
Corruption upon the Seculars, and by the
perpetual circulation of their secret Commu∣nications,
or Confessions, they miserably infect
and spoil one another. We may conclude
then, that the Confessionals are rather worse
than Bad Company; and for the little good
which sometimes by chance they may be the
cause of, they give occasion to far greater
Evils, which without there would never hap∣pen.</P>
<P>Moreover, we must add to this the dange∣rous
and false Doctrin, that is Taught and
Preached in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> with relation
to this Subject; which is this, <HI>That Attrition
being joyn'd with Confession, is sufficient to Sal∣vation,
to those who after Baptism are fallen into
Mortal Sin.</HI> This Attrition, according to them,
is a Sorrow for having offended God, only
for fear of the Eternal Punishments of Hell,
which are due to Sinners, without which they
would never have had any Sorrow for having
offended him. They suppose therefore, ac∣cording
to this Doctrin, that a Man who is
altogether destitute of Charity, or the Love
of God; and, what is more, who hath a
<PB N="318" REF="172"/>
formal Hatred against him, as he considers him
abstractedly in the effects of his Justice, may
nevertheless be saved, when he fears God only
as an Avenging God; so he do but super∣add
to this servile Fear, the Sacrament of Con∣fession.
This is that which gives a wonderful
presumption to Sinners, and encourageth them
to spend the chief part of their Lives in the
ways of Iniquity: For there is no Man, be he
never so profligately Wicked, who will not be
ready to promise for himself, when he is at the
Point of Death, he shall doubtless be seized
with the fear of falling into the hands of the
Living God, and yet have time enough to send
for a Confessor, to whom he may declare his
Sins; Which done, he is as sure of going to
Paradice, as the good Thief was on the
Cross.</P>
<P>This Doctrin was invented by the Priests
of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> to exalt the force
and virtue of Auricular Confession, which is
so pleasing and profitable to them, tho' with
the loss of so many Souls, who perish by this
unhappy Persuasion. Probably, after having
deceiv'd a great many others, they at last
deceive themselves also; for many of these
Confessors Dye like Dogs, and make desperate
Ends, endeavouring to persuade themselves,
that their Confession, and their fear of falling
into Hell with save them. I never found, that
the Priests and Monks were ever very ready
to go and confess themselves: They love no∣thing
<PB N="319" REF="172"/>
more, than to Confess others; and hate
nothing worse, than to Confess themselves.
A Noble <HI>Venetian</HI> told me, <HI>That before the
Publishing of a certain Order by the Patriarch,
by which he enjoyn'd all Priests to Confess them∣selves
at least once a Month, upon Penalty of
Interdict from Mass, and Suspension from all
Sacred Functions, there was scarcely a Priest to
be seen at</HI> Venice <HI>that went to Confession. One
might see them often going directly from the Stews
to the Altar, and to Confess others; but as for
themselves, they did not think it worth the
pains.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But at present they are obliged every Three
Months, to bring their Attestations to the Pa∣triarch
in Writing, that they have Confest
themselves according to Order. The same
Method is observ'd at</HI> Milan, <HI>and in several
other parts of</HI> Italy. <HI>As for the Hearing of
Confessions, and especially those of the Fair
Sex, alas, the Case is altered with them, and
they run to them very greedily! You'l see them
Walking in their Churches about their Con∣fession-Chairs
from Morning to Night, to
watch for a Bird to be snar'd in their Net.</HI>
How happy am I, <HI>(said once a Curate to me
of a great City in</HI> Italy) I have no Family to
put me to Charge, and I have much more Mony
than I know what to do with: I have often
most Ravishing Concerts of Musick in my Church,
in which I take unutterable Pleasure: When I
have nothing else to do, I walk under the sumptuous
<PB N="320" REF="173"/>
gilded Roofs of this Magnificent Temple, of which
I make (as it were) my own House: I never
want Company at my Confessional, where I meet
with the satisfaction of hearing a Thousand diffe∣rent
Stories and Adventures: God grant me the
Grace only, that after having enjoy'd my Paradice
in this World, I may afterwards go and possess it
in the other.</P>
<P>This is what I had to declare to you, con∣cerning
the practice of Sacramental Con∣fession
amongst the Papists; I shall only add,
that the Secrecy, which is as it were the Seal
of it, is not so faithfully observ'd as they
would fain have us believe it is: For many
things are discover'd by these Confessors, and
those poor Gally-Slaves, I but just now men∣tion'd,
and who 'tis likely to the very Hour
do Groan under that Dreadful Task, are a
sad, but certain instance of it. A Confessor
that reveals a Confession, according to the
Law in that case Provided, ought to be Burnt
alive: But tho' many Confessions be every
day reveal'd, yet don't we find so much as
one only Confessor, that has this Sentence
Executed upon him; forasmuch as it is in a
manner impossible to Convict them thereof.
A Priest is always believed upon his Oath,
and if he can but resolve to Swear that he
hath not revealed the Confession, there is no
going any further; so that at present Fire
and Fagot are only made use of against Sor∣cerers
and Hereticks. I could here have re∣lated
<PB N="321" REF="173"/>
to you many gallant Stories, as well as
some very Tragical ones, which have been
deposited with me in Confession, but I find
no inclination to do it; not because I fear
the Papists Fire, but because I am of the
mind, that an honest Man, who hath charg'd
himself with a Secret, is oblig'd in Honour to
keep it, as far as possibly he may. Indeed
this is the very Reason, why I have only en∣tertain'd
you here with some common things,
which are known to all those who will take
the pains to be a little inquisitive, and which
I have observ'd out of Confession, or which
have been told me by Persons of Credit, and
who have put me under no Engagement to
conceal them.</P>
<P>Some it may be will be desirous to be in∣form'd,
what kind of Penances the Confessors
impose upon their Penitents in Confession.
According to the Doctrin of <HI>Rome,</HI> tho' God
doth pardon Sins as to the Guilt, in Con∣fession,
and tho' he remits to Penitents the
External Punishment due to their Sins; yet
nevertheless his Will is, that they suffer here
for the same Sins some petty temporal Punish∣ment;
and this he has left to the Judgment
and Disposal of the Priests of the Church of
<HI>Rome,</HI> who may do in it what they please
themselves. Conformably to this they order
some to Fast on certain days, to others to say
a Set of Prayers, and to others to pay so
much Mony, and to some other to receive
<PB N="322" REF="174"/>
Discipline or Penance. There have been
found some of the New Saints of the Popish
Church, who out of Humility (so they ex∣press
themselves,) have made their Confessors
to give them Discipline; S. <HI>Rose,</HI> S. <HI>Theresa,</HI>
and Sister <HI>Margaret</HI> of the Holy Sacrament,
were of this Number. The Confessors, to
give them their due, are not wanting to
give Credit to, and to extend these holy Pra∣ctices
of Humility, upon which they bestow
continual Elogies; yet in the mean time, we
see that the generality of People are not
much affected with these kind of Examples,
and there are but some few of the Confessors
whose Persuasions, as to this Point, prove
Effectual.</P>
<P>The Penitentiaries or Confessors of the
Churches of S. <HI>Peter,</HI> of S. <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Lateran,</HI>
of <HI>Lorette,</HI> of S. <HI>January</HI> of <HI>Naples,</HI> of S. <HI>Pe∣tronius</HI>
of <HI>Boulogn,</HI> and of many other Places
of Devotion in <HI>Italy,</HI> have great white-Rods
in their Hands, as they sit in their Confessi∣onals,
wherewith they strike not only those
that come to be Confessed, but also all sorts
of Persons, be they Men or Women, that
present themselves before them to receive
their Blessing, giving them small Stroaks upon
their Head, their Shoulders, and their Ears;
which done, the Persons so Struck, make a
very low Bow to them by way of Thanks for
that Favour. An <HI>Armenian</HI> once demanded
of me, <HI>What was the meaning of this Practice?</HI>
<PB N="323" REF="174"/>
I told him that it was a Practice of Humili∣ty,
by which the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks exprest
their readiness to receive all the Chastisements,
which the Church thought good to inflict up∣on
them; to which he Answered, Smiling;
<HI>Do you believe</HI> (said he) <HI>that if these Black
Men who Beat them,</HI> (he meant by that Ex∣pression
the Jesuits, who are the Confessors
of S. <HI>Peter,</HI> and who are drest in Black) <HI>should
make good Sound Stroaks upon them, that the
People would express as much Earnestness to be
favoured with them, as now they do?</HI> I was not
able to answer him as to that Point: But
this I know, that upon a time a Protestant
of <HI>Geneva</HI> received such Stroaks from them,
that instead of Complimenting them for the
Favour, he run away from them as fast as ever
he could. This Protestant, it seems, who
was not Inur'd to the Ceremonies of the
Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> had the Curiosity to enter
the Church of S. <HI>Peter,</HI> at the time that Mass
was Saying, and was either so Neglectful or
Ignorant, as not to fall down on his Knees
when they Sounded the Bell at the Elevation
of the Host: Moreover, his Curiosity led
him to draw near to a Statue of S. <HI>Peter,</HI>
which is on the Right side of the Church,
near to the High Altar: This Statue is of
Brass, and Represents S. <HI>Peter</HI> sitting in a
Chair; He hath one of his Feet stretched
outward, and the People out of Devotion, and
to shew their Submission to the Holy See, come
<PB N="324" REF="175"/>
and kiss his Toes, and put heir Heads under
his Foot. The Protestant seeing them in these
Postures, could not forbear Laughing; but one
of the Jesuits, who had his Confessional near
that place, and who had observed him, came
to him with his great Wand, and struck him
as hard as ever he could upon his Head and
Shoulders: The Protestant betook himself to
his Heels, without so much as ever looking
behind him; the Jesuit all the while pursuing
and beating him till he was got out of Church.
The great Noise this made, occasion'd much
Distraction to those that were Hearing Mass,
and every one said, it was a Heretick, whom
the Jesuit had had the Zeal to bang out of the
Church. There was no Body that exprest the
least Compassion for him; and the Jesuit re∣turned
glorying in the Act he had performed,
saying, <HI>That tho' he had a good strong Arm, yet
he found that Hereticks Bones were stronger and
harder.</HI></P>
<P>At another time I saw a Protestant Abus'd
after the same manner in the Cathedral Church
of <HI>Strasbourg,</HI> in <HI>Germany;</HI> which could not
but be the more sensible to these Gentlemen,
because it was but a little before, that they
had voluntarily submitted themselves to the
Domination of <HI>France,</HI> and that they began
already to use them like Slaves, having scarcely
the free Exercise of their Religion allowed
them, in those few Churches, the Papists were
pleas'd to leave them.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="175"/>
GOD grant that others may become Wise
by their Example: This is one of my most
ardent Desires, wherewith I conclude these
Observations, made upon occasion of my
Journy ot <HI>Naples.</HI></P>
