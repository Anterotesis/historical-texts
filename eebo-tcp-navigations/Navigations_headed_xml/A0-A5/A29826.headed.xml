TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>A Great part of these Papers were Printed eight years since, and some of them have seen the light no less than twelve: But since that the Copies have been disposed of, and the Impressions sold, the <HI>Bookseller</HI> hath thought fit to Reprint them together. In order to which, whilst he gave me the Opportunity to read them over, I could not omit the making of divers Additions, and adjoyn∣ing another Journey through the delightful Country of <HI>Lombardy:</HI> Calling to mind the Magnificence of some <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquities, and the Remarkable Actions of great Men in those Quarters. Whereby I might give a short Ac∣count of the strange Fate and various Revolutions of divers of their ancient Cities. As to the natural Curiosities and Observations in the first parts, it would be unnecessary to make any Introduction, they having now run through so ma∣ny hands. I can only say, that what you had in scattered parts before, are here compacted together in one intire Vo∣lume, and hope for the same kind Acceptance. The num∣ber of the Cuts are increased, and the Figures of divers Habits, Medals and Antiquities, added: The Particular Description of which, in this <HI>Preface</HI> would prevent the sa∣tisfaction of considering them in their proper places; to which I shall refer you, wishing you the same pleasure in viewing them there, that I have had formerly in beholding them in their due Situations, and in the Contemplation and Description of them afterwards.</P>

THE General Description OF HUNGARY.</HEAD>
<P>HOW far <HI>HƲNGARIA</HI> exceeds other Countries of <HI>Europe</HI> in Mines, Baths and Mineral-waters; because I have elsewhere given a particular account of such Sub∣jects, I shall at present omit their repetitions, and at this time add some other Considerables; and in the first place say, That it aboundeth not only in those, but is also the best Rivered Country in <HI>Europe:</HI> nor doth any Region thereof afford so many noble and useful Streams.</P>
<P>On the East side it is washed with that Noble and Navigable River <HI>Tibiscus,</HI> or the <HI>Teisse,</HI> arising in the Country of <HI>Maromorus,</HI> at the foot of the high <HI>Carpathian</HI> Hills: which, having received the <HI>Mariscus</HI> or <HI>Marisa,</HI> and many Rivers into it, runneth into the <HI>Danube,</HI> between <HI>Varadine,</HI> St. <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Belgrade.</HI> By this River comes down the great quantity of natural Stone-salt, brought from many Salt-mines in <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Transylvania;</HI> whereof a great part is brought up the <HI>Danube</HI> to all Places, as far as <HI>Presburg;</HI> (it being prohibited to be car∣ried any higher) least it should hinder the sale of the <HI>Austrian</HI> Salt, upon which the Emperor hath an Impost, and no small quantity also down the <HI>Danube,</HI> and afterwards up the River <HI>Morava</HI> into <HI>Servia</HI> and neighbouring Countries.</P>
<P>On the West side runs the River <HI>Arabo</HI> or <HI>Rab,</HI> rising in <HI>Styria,</HI> and running into the <HI>Danube</HI> by <HI>Javrinum</HI> or <HI>Rab.</HI> A considerable River receiving the <HI>Lauffnitz, Pinca, Guncz,</HI> and other Rivers into it. And now lately more famous for the defeat of the <HI>Turks,</HI> under <HI>Achmet</HI> the Grand <HI>Visier,</HI> by the Imperial Forces, at St. <HI>Gothard,</HI> nigh this River. The discourse hereof was fresh, when I was at the City of <HI>Rab:</HI> and ma∣ny I found, who saw the Corps of Men and Horses floating in that Stream.</P>
<P>Upon the Southern Parts are considerable, the River <HI>Dravus</HI> or <HI>Drau,</HI> which arising in the Territory of <HI>Saltzburgland,</HI> a part of old <HI>Noricum,</HI> runs a long course through <HI>Carinthia</HI> and <HI>Hungary,</HI> and falls into the <HI>Danube</HI> near <HI>Erdoed,</HI> or old <HI>Teutoburgium;</HI> after it hath passed from its head about three hundred Miles. About its entrance into <HI>Hunga∣ry,</HI> it receiveth into it the long River <HI>Mur;</HI> and, far above this, nearer its original I found it a considerable Stream: having passed the same by a good Bridg as high as <HI>Villach</HI> or <HI>Villaco,</HI> and between <HI>Clagenfort</HI> and Mount <HI>Leubell</HI> in <HI>Carinthia,</HI> I passed the same also by two long Wooden Bridges, and an Island in the middle between them.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4"/>
On the same side is also the noble River <HI>Savus,</HI> or the <HI>Sau;</HI> which a∣rising in <HI>Carinthia,</HI> entreth the <HI>Danube</HI> at <HI>Belgrade;</HI> continuing a long course of about three hundred Miles, and swelling by the accession of many good Rivers. Being at <HI>Carnodunum</HI> or <HI>Crainburg,</HI> an handsom Town, not far distant from the Head, it appeared a considerable Stream; which is afterwards so enlarged, as to have remarkable Islands in it, as that of <HI>Metubaris,</HI> to the West of old <HI>Sirmium,</HI> and that of <HI>Segestica</HI> or <HI>Sisseck,</HI> by <HI>Zagrabia,</HI> containing of old a strong and famous Town; unto which the old <HI>R mans</HI> brought their Commodities from <HI>Aquileia,</HI> and so by Land to <HI>Labach</HI> or <HI>Nauportus;</HI> from thence unto <HI>Segestica,</HI> and forwards, for the supply of those Provinces and their Garrisons and Forces in them. Between these two noble Currents of the <HI>Dravus</HI> and the <HI>Savus,</HI> lyeth a fair and long <HI>Inter-amnian</HI> Country, wherein <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent chose a safe retreat, until he came to <HI>Bel∣grade:</HI> when, with about four hundred thousand Men, which he brought to take <HI>Vienna,</HI> he dared not to meet the Forces of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, then encamped before that City.</P>
<P>Upon the North part of <HI>Hungary,</HI> are the Rivers arising from the <HI>Carpathian</HI> Mountains, which divide <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Hungary;</HI> more parti∣cularly the River <HI>Gran,</HI> which runs into the <HI>Danube,</HI> over against <HI>Strigonium</HI> or <HI>Gran;</HI> and also the River <HI>Waag</HI> or <HI>Vagus,</HI> which comes in above <HI>Comara:</HI> which <HI>Stuckius,</HI> an ocular Witness, conceiveth to e∣qual the <HI>Po</HI> in <HI>Italy.</HI> I am sure, at <HI>Freistat,</HI> above fifty Miles, before it dischargeth into the <HI>Danube,</HI> it is a very large Stream, and hath a long Bridge over it; part whereof was broken down by the Ice, the same year when I was there. And far above it, nearer the head, there is also a considerable Bridge at <HI>Trenschin,</HI> a fair Town, which gives the name unto that Country, and much resorted unto for its hot Baths and Mineral Waters; having no less than thirty two plentiful Springs.</P>
<P>The great <HI>Danubius</HI> or <HI>Thonau</HI> continues its Stream quite through <HI>Hungary;</HI> and no one Province hath a larger share of it; for account∣ing from the City of <HI>Vlme</HI> in <HI>Swabenland</HI> or <HI>Suevia,</HI> where it begin∣neth to be Navigable, it continues a long course, passing by <HI>Ingolstad, Ratisbone, Straubing, Passau, Lintz</HI> and <HI>Vienna</HI> unto <HI>Presburg;</HI> from whence through <HI>Hungary</HI> it makes a course of above three hundred Miles, before it passes by <HI>Belgrade:</HI> To omit the long Stream thereof in its farther progress, when having washed the Shoars of <HI>Servia, Bul∣garia, Wallachia</HI> and <HI>Moldavia,</HI> with many mouths it entreth the <HI>Eu∣xine</HI> or <HI>Bla k-Sea:</HI> having in this long passage drank in above sixty con∣siderable Rivers; and in sober account performed a course of above fifteen hundred Miles. Whereby it may tolerably admit the double name of <HI>Danubius</HI> and <HI>Ister,</HI> properly applyed unto distinct Parts thereof.</P>
<P>So that, altho I have seen the <HI>Danubius,</HI> for about seven hundred Miles; yet cannot tell, whether I may certainly say, that I have seen a∣ny part of <HI>Ister.</HI> For <HI>Strabo</HI> ascribes that name unto it, below its <HI>Cataract,</HI> or great fall, which happenes about <HI>Axiopolis,</HI> in <HI>Moesia</HI> in∣ferior, or <HI>Bulgaria.</HI> But <HI>Appianus,</HI> and later Account, define it to be∣gin at its concurrence with the <HI>Savus</HI> at <HI>Belgrade:</HI> and if so, yet we had but a short sight of the <HI>Ister;</HI> which travelling more up into <HI>Ser∣via,</HI> we were fain to leave at <HI>Hissargich.</HI> And of this <HI>Ister</HI> or lower part of the River, many things are spoken and related by the Ancients, which are not so plainly verifiable of <HI>Danubius.</HI></P>

<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
Besides these large Rivers above named, there are some others, taken notice of also by <HI>Pliny;</HI> and esteemed <HI>Huvii non ignobiles.</HI> The <HI>Sar∣vizza</HI> or <HI>Orpanus,</HI> arising near <HI>Vesprinium,</HI> and passing by <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> runs into the <HI>Danube,</HI> which I passed over at <HI>Jeni,</HI> or <HI>nova Palan∣ka.</HI> The River <HI>Walpo</HI> or <HI>Vulpanus,</HI> arising above the Town of <HI>Walpo,</HI> which was taken by <HI>Solyman,</HI> in his march to <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> or <HI>Stull-Weissenburg.</HI> We passed over it by <HI>Walcovar,</HI> and the River <HI>Bosneth</HI> or <HI>Bacun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hus,</HI> which runs into the <HI>Savus,</HI> not far from old <HI>Sirmi∣um.</HI></P>
<P>As this Country excels in Rivers, so has it also many considera∣ble and long Bridges. There is a long Bridge of Boats over the <HI>Danube,</HI> between <HI>Strigonium</HI> and <HI>Barchan,</HI> which is the first Bridge on this Ri∣ver, which we meet with from the great Wooden Bridge at <HI>Vienna,</HI> which takes above two thousand Trees to plancher it. Upon the shoar of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s <HI>Island</HI> by <HI>Virouichitz,</HI> I took notice of a ruine of Stones, where the <HI>Turks</HI> told us, there had been formerly a Stone Bridge: but the <HI>Turks</HI> in these Parts, think it best to make Bridges of Boats; which they so handsomly contrive, as to open a passage for Boats and Vessels of burthen to pass; so that he that beholds those in these Parts, will not wonder at the Bridges of Boats at <HI>Rouen,</HI> and <HI>Grenoble</HI> in <HI>France.</HI> Between <HI>Buda</HI> and <HI>Pest,</HI> there is a Bridge of Boats over the <HI>Danube,</HI> where it runs all in one Stream, of above half a Mile long, the best I have seen of this kind; and if <HI>Sigismund</HI> had lived to effect his De∣sign, of making a notable Stone Bridge in this Place, there had proba∣bly been no Bridge in <HI>Europe</HI> to compare with it. There is also a Bridge at <HI>Calocza,</HI> formerly an <HI>Archbishop</HI>'s Sea, and a handsome and well-contrived Bridge, by <HI>Walcovar</HI> over the River <HI>Walpo.</HI> But that of <HI>Esseck,</HI> or <HI>Mursa</HI> of old, is scarce to be parallel'd with any other; built partly over the <HI>Dravus,</HI> and partly over the <HI>Fenns,</HI> which are often overflowed. The Bridge is five Miles at least in length, having Towers built upon it at the distance of every quarter of a Mile: It is hand∣somly railed on each side, and supported by great Trees, erected under it; nine or ten in a rank, unto each Arch. That part of the Bridge, which was built over the <HI>Dravus,</HI> was burnt down by Count <HI>Nicholas Serin,</HI> in the late <HI>Turkish</HI> Wars between <HI>Leopoldus</HI> the First, Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> and <HI>Sultan Mahomet</HI> the Fourth: and is now supplyed by a Bridge of Boats, somewhat below the former; which I passed o∣ver in <HI>September,</HI> 1669. The <HI>Turks</HI> did not rebuild it in the same place, because the Supporters below the Water, when the fire ceased, were so strongly fastned and hard, that it would have cost them too great a labour to get them up. By this Bridge the <HI>Turkish</HI> Forces pass into <HI>Hungary:</HI> and at this place the unfortunate King <HI>Ludovicus</HI> thought to have stopped the <HI>Turkish</HI> Army which marched under <HI>So∣lyman.</HI> And lately Count <HI>Serini</HI> undertook a long March to burn the same, to prevent Supplies from coming to the <HI>Visier,</HI> who was with his Army in other parts of <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>
<P>And as there are still many Bridges over the upper <HI>Danube,</HI> so have there also been in Old time upon the lower, or <HI>Istrian</HI> part thereof. <HI>Darius</HI> King of <HI>Persia</HI> made a Bridge of Boats over that Mouth of the <HI>Ister</HI> called <HI>Ostium Sacrum. Nicephorus</HI> relates, that <HI>Constantine</HI> built a Stone Bridge over it. But the most remarkable and admirable Bridge, was that, built by the Emperor <HI>Adrian,</HI> and described by <HI>Dion</HI> the Hi∣storian: whereof there are still some Ruines, not far from <HI>Severin,</HI> a∣bout
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
twenty <HI>Hungarian</HI> Miles from <HI>Belgrade.</HI> This Bridge consisted of twenty Piles of square Stone of an hundred foot high, besides the Foundation: of sixty foot in breadth, and the distance between each of them one hundred and seventy foot; and conjoyned by Arches, upon the which was this Inscription,</P>
<Q>PROVIDENTIA AUG. VERE PONTIFICIS VIRTUS ROMANA QUID NON DOMAT? SUB JUGUM ECCE RAPITUR ET DANUBIUS.</Q>
<P>And, as a Memorial hereof, many <HI>Roman</HI> Coins were stamped, and some in Silver, not yet rare among us, with this Inscription, DANU∣VIUS.</P>
<P>No River affordes so large and peopled Islands. Between <HI>Vicegrad</HI> and <HI>Vacia,</HI> there is a fair and large Island, called St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s Island. Another a little below <HI>Buda,</HI> against the West side of which stands <HI>Adom,</HI> extending forty Miles; and exceeds that of the <HI>Isle of Man,</HI> containing many Villages in it; upon part whereof the <HI>Turkish</HI> For∣ces encamped, when they came to raise the <HI>Christian</HI> Siege at <HI>Buda,</HI> and was the great omission and error of the Christians, that they for∣tified not in that Island. Another against <HI>Mohatch:</HI> another about the entrance of the <HI>Dravus:</HI> and a new one hard by <HI>Belgrade,</HI> made by the settling of the <HI>Silt</HI> or <HI>Ouse</HI> brought down by the <HI>Savus</HI> and the <HI>Danube;</HI> where thirty five years ago there was no face of an Island, but is now full of Trees; how this may advantage or disadvantage <HI>Belgrade,</HI> future times may shew. But the <HI>Turks</HI> are so secure and fearless of any Forces, that may ever hurt them in these Parts, that they have no consideration of such things. And allowing the River <HI>Leyta</HI> to be the boundary of <HI>Austria,</HI> the Island of <HI>Schut,</HI> or <HI>Insula Ci∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uorum,</HI> will prove most considerable of any; containing many good Towns, as <HI>Comora, Sumarien;</HI> besides very many Villages. And pas∣sing through it, I found it well peopled and ordered against Incursi∣ons; wherein there have been divers, formerly made by <HI>Turks, Tar∣tars,</HI> and rebellious Forces.</P>
<P>No River whatsoever, so far from its discharge into the Sea, af∣fordes more Naval Vessels of strength and sufficiency for Fight; nor hath any afforded the like signal Engagements and Encounters, at this di∣stance from the Sea. The Emperor hath some Vessels of War handsom∣ly built, like Gallies at <HI>Vienna, Presburg</HI> and <HI>Comora;</HI> and an <HI>Arsenal</HI> for provision of many upon occasion. The <HI>Turk</HI> at <HI>Strigonium, Buda, Belgrade,</HI> and other places below.</P>
<P>At the Siege of <HI>Belgrade, Mahomet</HI> the great brought two hundred Ships and Gallies, well appointed, up the Stream. And the <HI>Hungarians</HI> sent<NOTE PLACE="marg">Turkish History.</NOTE> so many down the Stream, from <HI>Buda,</HI> that after a sharp encoun∣ter, they took twenty of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Vessels, and forced the rest on Shoar near the Camp; so that, to prevent falling into the Enemies hand, <HI>Mahomet</HI> was fain to cause them to be set on fire. The <HI>Christi∣ans</HI> had a great Fleet at the Siege of <HI>Buda,</HI> when all miscarried under<NOTE PLACE="marg">Turkish History.</NOTE> Count <HI>Regensdorff.</HI> For the History delivers, that the <HI>Christian</HI> Fleet consisted of four and twenty Galliots, about fourscore small Pinnaces, and little less than an hundred Ships of Burthen, and other great Boats.
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
By the help of such Naval Vessels <HI>Wolfgandus Hodder</HI> did a good piece of Service, when <HI>Solyman</HI> besieged <HI>Vienna;</HI> for he came out of <HI>Presburg</HI> with armed Vessels, and sunk the Vessels sent from <HI>Buda</HI> with the great Ordnance, to batter the Walls of <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P>And as this Country aboundeth in Rivers, so is it not without some notable Lakes, as the Lake <HI>Balaton</HI> or <HI>Platsee,</HI> or <HI>Volcaea</HI> of old, extend∣ing a great length between <HI>Vesprinium</HI> and the <HI>Dravus,</HI> with some strong Forts upon it. This Lake put a stop unto the cruelty of <HI>Soly∣man</HI>'s Souldiers, who destroyed all from <HI>Buda</HI> unto the Lake <HI>Balaton.</HI> And since it lyeth on the East of the River <HI>Leyta,</HI> we may also reckon in the <HI>Newsidler</HI> Sea, a pleasant Lake, seven <HI>German</HI> Miles long, and three broad: so called from <HI>Newsidel,</HI> a small Town, of one street and some backward Houses, with a small square Castle upon an Hill by it, from whence I had a good prospect o∣ver all the Lake. In the Commotions of <HI>Botscay,</HI> fourteen Villages a∣bout this Lake were burnt by <HI>Turks, Tartars</HI> and rebellious <HI>Heyducks.</HI> The <HI>Hungarians</HI> call it <HI>Terteu</HI> and <HI>Pliny, Peiso.</HI> It is in the middle way between <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Sabaria,</HI> the birth-place of Saint <HI>Martin.</HI> The long extended plain of <HI>Pampus,</HI> in <HI>Paraguay</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> exceeds all others, as being two thousand Miles in length. And I have heard that famous Navigator, Captain <HI>Narborough,</HI> say, who not long since, was Commander of the <HI>Sweepstakes,</HI> and made a Voyage in her into the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> that there is all low Land from the River of <HI>Plate,</HI> unto the middle of the Straights of <HI>Magellan. Moscovia</HI> and <HI>Poland</HI> have long Plains, but many of them Woody, and obscured by Trees; but none more open and clear Plains than this Country. The greatest Plains. I have observed in <HI>England,</HI> are those of <HI>Salisbury, Lincoln</HI> and <HI>New-Market.</HI> But these are but long Walks, compared with those of <HI>Hungary;</HI> and are exceeded by the Plains of <HI>Austria,</HI> from <HI>Vienna</HI> unto Mount <HI>Simmeren,</HI> unto the Borders of <HI>Styria.</HI> And though the <HI>Ʋpper-Hungary</HI> be hilly and plentiful in Wood; yet are there large Plains below. I travelled from <HI>Vienna</HI> to <HI>Belgrade,</HI> about four hundred Miles, upon continued and not interrupted Plains; which often appeared like the Sea, without any visible Eminencies, only a short and plain Wood, by <HI>Bacna,</HI> and <HI>Shilberg,</HI> beyond <HI>Dotis;</HI> and if we reckon the full of this Plain, it will prove much longer, extending from Mount <HI>Kalenberg</HI> or <HI>Cetius,</HI> two <HI>German</HI> Miles West-ward of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and so beyond <HI>Bel∣grade,</HI> still along the North side of the <HI>Danube,</HI> unto the Borders of <HI>Walachia;</HI> which will make a larger extent, than the famous long Walk from <HI>Agra</HI> to <HI>Lahor</HI> in <HI>India.</HI> This plainness of the Country, affords an handsome way of Travelling in open Chariots, carrying one or two Men with a Charioter, drawn by two or three, sometimes four Horses a Breast; and room enough to lye down. In this man∣ner I travelled from <HI>Buda</HI> to <HI>Belgrade,</HI> over fair large Plains; and ma∣ny Miles upon Green-Swarthe and unworn Wayes; especially in the County of <HI>Sirmium</HI> or <HI>Schremnia,</HI> as they now call it.</P>
<P>No Country hath so large a share of <HI>Capital Cities</HI> upon the <HI>Da∣nube;</HI> for whereas from the course thereof, from <HI>Ʋlme</HI> unto <HI>Belgrade,</HI> there are reckoned Ten very considerable ones, there are no less than four thereof, that is <HI>Presburg, Strigonium, Buda</HI> and <HI>Belgrade,</HI> accounted unto <HI>Hungary;</HI> and <HI>Buda,</HI> with the addition of <HI>Pest,</HI> on the otherside the Water, seems to be the largest of them all; and I believe the lar∣gest also of any upon that Stream.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7"/>
And as this Country excels in <HI>Rivers,</HI> so is it very abundant in <HI>Fishes.</HI> The <HI>Tibiscus</HI> or <HI>Teisse,</HI> is esteemed the most Fishy River in <HI>Europe,</HI> if not in the World; insomuch, that they have a common say∣ing, <HI>That it consists of two parts of Water, and one of Fish.</HI> And the River <HI>Bodrack</HI> which runs into the <HI>Tibiscus,</HI> not far from <HI>Tokay,</HI> is so re∣plenished with <HI>Fish,</HI> that in the Summer when the River is low, the Peo∣ple say the Water smells of Fish. And this is no small River, but as I had the account from a Commander who purposely made it for <FIGURE>
</FIGURE> me when he passed it, was thirty Fathoms broad, and eight and an half deep, but being of this Figure it could not be well Fished with Nets. Which exceeding fertility, if any will ascribe unto Saline Tinctures, both of its own Stream, and others accessionary into it, which lick the many natural Salt-Mines un∣der ground, and so may carry with them, or at least promote some Principles of foecundity, may admit of consideration. The <HI>Danube</HI> aboundeth in many good <HI>Fishes;</HI> as <HI>Trouts, Perches,</HI> large and delici∣ous <HI>Carpes,</HI> exceeding any I have seen; and besides many others, a Fish called <HI>Coppen,</HI> a kind of <HI>Capito;</HI> a <HI>Biscurne,</HI> or kind of <HI>Lamprey,</HI> a <HI>Grundel,</HI> or spotted kind of <HI>Cobites,</HI> with six Beards, two short, and four longer; a large Fish much exceeding a <HI>Pike,</HI> called <HI>Scheyden,</HI> a <HI>Silurus Gesneri:</HI> and above all, there is at some Seasons great store of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lusones,</HI> called by them <HI>Hausons:</HI> whereof some are twenty foot long; esteemed a very good dish, and somewhat like <HI>Sturgeon.</HI> There are set Fishing-places and Store-houses upon the side of the <HI>Danube;</HI> where∣of the highest is above <HI>Como a,</HI> upon <HI>Schut-Island,</HI> but the greatest Fishing is about <HI>Kilia</HI> in <HI>Walachia;</HI> where they salt them, and send them into other Parts: they come out of the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea.</P>
<P>As the Rivers are full of Fish, so are they covered with <HI>Fowl,</HI> in the Winter; <HI>Swans</HI> I observed none in the <HI>Danube,</HI> but many other Fowls; and some <HI>Pelicans,</HI> not far from <HI>Belgrade.</HI></P>
<P>As the Waters are also fruitful in Fish, so the Land aboundeth in o∣ther <HI>Provisions;</HI> and very eminently in the two supporters of Life, <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine:</HI> their Bread is hardly exceeded by any in <HI>Europe;</HI> worked up and kneaded with long continued labour; and so made light wholsome, and well tasted; and at so cheap a rate, that for two pence as much is afforded there, as twelve pence with us in <HI>England.</HI> And indeed in all the <HI>Turkish Dominions,</HI> where I travelled, I met with so good and well tasted Bread, that with Wine, it was a Feast; and with Water a sufficient Repast. <HI>Grapes</HI> they have very delicious and large; those at <HI>Virouichitz</HI> by <HI>Vacia,</HI> are of eminent Note; <HI>Wines</HI> also of a generous and noble sort; the Wines of <HI>Tokay</HI> are highly esteem∣ed; the <HI>Sirmian</HI> Wines are very rich and pleasant, in the South part of <HI>Hungary,</HI> in which Province the Emperor <HI>Probus</HI> is said to have planted Vines, about Mount <HI>Almus</HI> or <HI>Arpataro.</HI> In many other pla∣ces the Wines are very noble; and some brought unto <HI>Vienna,</HI> where there are above thirty sorts of Wines to be sold, brought from several Parts.</P>
<P>And as the ground is not unfruitful in its own Nature, so they are not without the practise of <HI>Good-Husbandry,</HI> both in their Arable and Pasture Grounds: especially in <HI>Ʋpper-Hungary,</HI> and Parts not subje∣cted to the <HI>Turks.</HI> I being there, about the end of <HI>February,</HI> saw eve∣ry night all the Country about us on fire, occasioned, by burning the Stubble and Grass and Herbs; which afterwards, arose with plenty again.</P>
<Q><PB N="7" REF="7"/>
<L>Saepe etiam sterileis incendere profuit agros,</L>
<L>Atque levem stipulam crepitantibus urere flammis.</L></Q>
<Q><L>To set their Fields on fire, and Stubble burn</L>
<L>With crackling Flames, does to their profit turn.</L></Q>
<P>They use not Barnes or Stackes of Corn; but have many deep and large Caves under Ground, wherein they lay it up safe, both from Rob∣bers and sudden incursion of Enemies. At <HI>Clesch</HI> near <HI>Toopolchan,</HI> when the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> made their Inroads in the last Wars, the People retired, and hid themselves in such Cavities; but some <HI>Turks,</HI> speaking <HI>Schlavonian,</HI> told them that the Coast was clear, and the Ene∣my gone; and so tempting them out of their Holes, they were unfor∣tunately deceived into Captivity, and carried away into remote Coun∣treys never to be heard of again.</P>
<P>There is also great plenty of <HI>Deer, Hares,</HI> all sorts of <HI>Poultrey, Par∣tridges</HI> and <HI>Pheasants;</HI> great store of <HI>Sheep,</HI> which in divers places, have long Spiral Horns, and very long curled Wooll. And <HI>Oxen</HI> in great numbers, whereof 'tis thought they send an hundred thousand yearly into <HI>Italy, Germany,</HI> and other Parts; and it is commonly said, they have enough to serve a great part of <HI>Europe.</HI> They are of a kind of <HI>Mouse-colour;</HI> and the <HI>Eastern Company</HI> at <HI>Vienna</HI> hath the privilege to bring them, to furnish that City. There are also <HI>Buffelo</HI>'s, where∣of they make no small advantage, in ploughing of their Lands, espe∣cially in some stiff Grounds, where they must else use five Yoaks of <HI>Oxen</HI> to a Plough; and one in my company told me that he had been fain to make use of six <HI>Buffelo</HI>'s to draw a light <HI>Calleche,</HI> or Chariot through some Grounds. Not far from <HI>Botesech,</HI> there are <HI>Horses</HI> also in very great number, some large, many but small, yet swift. I saw a thousand of them belonging to the Peasants at <HI>Sone, Sene</HI> or <HI>Senia,</HI> a Village upon the <HI>Danube,</HI> in the Contribution Country, nor far from <HI>Comara.</HI></P>
<P>As they exceed in many things, so they are peculiar in some others; particularly in their <HI>Language,</HI> which is proper to themselves, and dif∣ferent from any other. I went to a Church at <HI>Bitchka,</HI> where the Minister Prayed and Preached; and though there were a very good Linguist with me, who spake <HI>Schlavonian, German, Turkish, Vulgar Greek</HI> and <HI>Italian;</HI> yet could he make nothing of it, or find affinity in it, with any other Language he knew. A Specimen hereof is set down by <HI>Megiserus,</HI> of the <HI>Lords Prayer,</HI> in that Language. <HI>Mi At∣tyanck Ky vagy az meniegbe, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh Szentel Tesseck az te newed,</HI> &amp;c. In the like manner we were confounded by the Language of <HI>Albania,</HI> on the Northward part of <HI>Epirus,</HI> and West of <HI>Macedonia.</HI> We made use of some of that Countrey in passing the Mountains, who were able to speak some <HI>Schlavonian:</HI> But as for <HI>Albanese,</HI> or their own Language, wherein they were delighted to sing Day and Night, as they travelled with us, our best Linguists, both <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Christians,</HI> understood nothing of it.</P>
<P>In some parts of <HI>Hungary,</HI> many speak <HI>Schlavonian,</HI> at <HI>Freistat,</HI> which the <HI>Hungarians</HI> call <HI>Colgotz.</HI> I observed, that at the Church, the Ser∣mon was in <HI>Schlavonian;</HI> but at the <HI>Franciscans</HI> Church, in <HI>Hungarian.</HI> This incommunication in Speech, makes them to learn other Langua∣ges,
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
and especially the <HI>Latin,</HI> which very great numbers speak, especi∣ally the <HI>Gentry</HI> and <HI>Souldiers,</HI> and I scarce met with any elsewhere, who spake it more ready, than the Noble <HI>Graff Sacchy,</HI> Governour of <HI>Dotis,</HI> and his Lieutenant <HI>Elvedy.</HI> I have also met with Coachmen, Watermen, and mean Persons, who could make themselves understood thereby.</P>
<P>The <HI>Latin-Tongue</HI> is very serviceable in <HI>Hungaria</HI> and <HI>Transylvania:</HI> but below <HI>Belgrade</HI> of little help unto a Traveller, where that far extend∣ing Language, the <HI>Scklavonian,</HI> prevails. And indeed, with the help of two Languages, <HI>German</HI> and <HI>Schlavonian,</HI> a Man may make a shift to Tra∣vel from <HI>Hamburg</HI> to the Boders of <HI>Tartary,</HI> and to <HI>Constantinople.</HI> And I have heard that the <HI>Schlavonian</HI> alone is understood from <HI>Mock∣elberg</HI> in <HI>Germany</HI> to the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea. And before we come to <HI>Belgrade,</HI> the <HI>Schlavonian</HI> enters again; which is also spoken in <HI>Servia, Bulgaria, Romania,</HI> and a great part of <HI>Macedonia;</HI> and in so many other Coun∣trys, that with this Language a Man may make a shift to be under∣stood from the <HI>Adriatick-Shore</HI> of <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> unto the <HI>Tartarian Ocean.</HI> For we read in <HI>Purchas,</HI> that when the <HI>Hollanders</HI> returned from <HI>Nova Zembla;</HI> the Inhabitants not very far off could say, <HI>Dobre,</HI> and <HI>Nich Dobre;</HI> that is, <HI>Good,</HI> and not <HI>Good;</HI> which are expressions of <HI>approv∣ing</HI> or <HI>disapproving,</HI> in the <HI>Schlavonian</HI> Language.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turkish</HI> Power so much prevailing or threatning in these Parts; it is in vain, to expect any great <HI>Ʋniversity</HI> beyond <HI>Vienna.</HI> Nor do I find that there hath been any very considerable ones in this Countrey; and though they have had many <HI>Bishops</HI> and learned Men; yet they have had their Education many of them out of <HI>Hungary.</HI> As had also of old St. <HI>Jerom</HI> St. <HI>Martin.</HI> And the present <HI>Hungarians,</HI> which addict themselves unto Learning, especially those of Quality, do com∣monly Study at <HI>Vienna, Prague</HI> or <HI>Breslaw;</HI> a small University, or pub∣lick Study there is at present at <HI>Schemnitz.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Hungarians</HI> may justly boast of early helps unto learning, and a very noble <HI>Library</HI> erected at <HI>Buda,</HI> by their King <HI>Matthias Cor∣vinus,</HI> Son of the famous <HI>Hunniades,</HI> about two hundred years ago; consisting of some thousands of Books, especially <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latine</HI> Ma∣nuscripts not to be met with or Purchased elsewhere; part whereof was dispersed into the <HI>Turkish Dominions,</HI> when <HI>Solyman</HI> surprized that City; and a choice part thereof procured afterwards, for the <HI>Imperial Library</HI> at <HI>Vienna,</HI> when <HI>Cuspinianus</HI> was Keeper thereof, divers where∣of are marked with the Armes of <HI>Corvinus, a Crow bearing a Gold Ring in his Beak;</HI> which with many succeeding additions, made by <HI>Busbe∣quius, Wolfgangus, Lazius, Fugger,</HI> and others; together with the choicest <HI>Manuscripts,</HI> brought from the <HI>Ambrasian Library</HI> near <HI>Inspruch,</HI> by the Learned <HI>Petrus Lambecius,</HI> the present Library Keeper, make up the fourscore thousand Volumes, now contained in the <HI>Emperors Library</HI> at <HI>Vienna,</HI> by the especial Favour of which wor∣thy Person, I had the honour, not only to see many of the choicest and most specious thereof, together with many Noble Rarities in that Place; but to have any useful Book unto my private Lodgings. And at my coming away, he gave me a <HI>Catalogue</HI> of some hundreds of <HI>Al∣chymical Manuscripts,</HI> which are in that Library, which I presented to the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> from him; with leave to have any of them brought into <HI>England,</HI> or to be Transcribed at <HI>Vienna,</HI> if they pleased. And if the three most admirable <HI>Brass Statua</HI>'s of <HI>Hercules, Apollo</HI> and <HI>Diana,</HI> which were placed at the entrance of <HI>Corvinus</HI> his Palace in <HI>Buda,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
had not been carried away by <HI>Solyman,</HI> and cast into <HI>Ordnance</HI> at <HI>Con∣stantinople;</HI> it is not improbable, they had been by this time at <HI>Vienna.</HI> About four hundred Books, the Reliques and refuse of the Library at <HI>Buda,</HI> were lately remaining there; where it was no easie matter to have a sight of them; yet so carelesly kept by the <HI>Turks,</HI> that Worms, Mice and Rats were like to have the Spoil thereof. But the <HI>Fire</HI> at <HI>Buda</HI> 1669, hath now consumed them all.</P>
<P>And as their Language is peculiar, so is the Opinion of their Crown; of which they have the greatest esteem of any other Nation. This they commonly believe to have been brought by an Angel from Hea∣ven unto St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> their King: and have so high an estimation there∣of, that they think, the Right and Fate of the Kingdom goeth with the possession thereof. Which makes them very wary in the Custody of it, and in all Adversities to secure it. And the <HI>Turk</HI> hath been al∣ways industrious to obtain it. It was formerly kept in the Castle of <HI>Vicegrad;</HI> but at present in that of <HI>Presburg.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pineda</HI> cut of <HI>Cromerus.</HI></NOTE> And this opinion is probably founded upon the Tradition or Story, how they came unto it; which is thus delivered. King <HI>Stephen</HI> inten∣ding to settle the Christian Government in his Kingdom, appointed two <HI>Arch-Bishops Sees; Strigonium,</HI> which was the place of his Nativity, and <HI>Colocza;</HI> and sent <HI>Astricus,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Colocza,</HI> to the Pope, to confirm the same, together with his Kingdom, and to send him a Crown, and other Royal Ornaments. At the same time it fell out, that <HI>Misca,</HI> King of <HI>Polonia,</HI> sent about the same Errant: and a Crown was providing for him. But Pope <HI>Benedict</HI> the Eight, in the mean time was warned by an Angelical <HI>Apparition,</HI> to send the Crown unto King <HI>Stephen;</HI> which accordingly he did, which probably begot that great Venerati∣on and high Opinion, they have ever since had of it.</P>
<P>The Crown it self is also singular in its Fashion and Figure; for it is a low Crown, with a Cross upon it, with four Leaves or Turnings up about it; one whereof is as large as the other three, at least as two thereof. It is no easic Favour to obtain a view of this Crown at <HI>Pres∣burg,</HI> but I saw a Model of it in the Treasure of the present Emperor <HI>Leopoldus;</HI> which was a Crown of Gold, adorned with many precious Stones, exactly made after the fashion of the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Crown, and perhaps richer than the exemplar.</P>
<P>Though the <HI>Hungarians</HI> want not Ingenuity, Industry, and sufficient parts for Learning, and liberal Arts; yet have they been more addicted unto <HI>Martial affairs,</HI> than unto deep Learning: Even the <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Clergy-men</HI> proving stout Soldiers; and no less than six <HI>Bishops</HI> were slain, with their King <HI>Ludovicus,</HI> in that fatal Battel of <HI>Mohatch.</HI></P>
<P>Some report, and others believe, that the famous Poet, <HI>Ovid</HI> died, and was buried in <HI>Hungary</HI> at <HI>Sabaria,</HI> seated at the confluence of the Rivers <HI>Guntz</HI> and <HI>Regnitz</HI> before they run into the <HI>Rab.</HI> Where it is reported, that he having been banished unto <HI>Tomos,</HI> near the <HI>Euxine Sea,</HI> was at last recalled, and in his return towards <HI>Italy</HI> died at <HI>Sabarta.</HI> Where 'tis said his Tomb was found with this <HI>Epitaph,</HI> made by himself:</P>
<LG>
<L>Hic situs est Vates, quem Divi <HI>Caesaris</HI> Ira</L>
<L><HI>Augusti</HI> patriâ cedere jussit humo.</L>

Before I came into <HI>Hungary,</HI> I observed no shadow or shew of the old <HI>Pyrrhical Saltation,</HI> or Warlike way of Dancing, which the <HI>Hey∣ducks</HI> practice in this Country. They dance with naked Swords in their hands, advancing, brandishing and clashing the same; turning, winding, elevating, and depressing their bodies with strong and active motions; singing withal unto their measures, after the manner of the <HI>Greeks.</HI></P>
<P>The mighty Acts of <HI>Attila,</HI> King of this Country, together with the numerous Forces he brought out of these and the neighbouring parts, are very remarkable; whereby he over-ran a considerable part of <HI>Germany,</HI> and a great part of <HI>Italy:</HI> Sacked and Burnt <HI>Aquileia;</HI> and fought that memorable Battel with <HI>Aetius,</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> General, in <HI>Campis Catalonicis,</HI> near <HI>Tholouse;</HI> wherein 'tis said were ten <HI>Kings</HI> pre∣sent, and about two hundred thousand slain: and, which is also ob∣servable, the Generals on both sides were of these Parts; for <HI>Attila</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jornandes.</NOTE> was a <HI>Hunne,</HI> and <HI>Aetius</HI> a <HI>Maesian,</HI> or <HI>Servian,</HI> of the neighbour Country. And in succeeding Ages, how far and widely the Kings of <HI>Hungary</HI> enlarged their Dominions, besides many Historical Accounts, is tellified at their Coronation, by ten <HI>Banners</HI> carried by Great Per∣sons;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Monsieur</HI> de Fumee.</NOTE> wherein were represented ten <HI>Provinces</HI> of that Kingdom: that is, <HI>Hungaria, Dalmatia, Croatia, Schlavonia, Galisia, Rascia, Servia, Bulgaria, Bosnia,</HI> and <HI>Ludomiria.</HI></P>
<P>This Country has given the longest stop unto the <HI>Turkish</HI> Conquests, and farther intrusion into the Western Parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> For most, which they have already obtained, has been upon the advantage of the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Divisions, and their own subtilty and false practises; and <HI>Solyman,</HI> by such false and low dealings, surprized the Capital City of <HI>Buda.</HI> And although the <HI>Turk</HI> has now obtained the best part of the Country; yet almost a third part remains out of his Power, and in obedience to the Emperor, as King of <HI>Hungaria:</HI> as almost all <HI>Ʋpper Hungary,</HI> from <HI>Presburg</HI> unto <HI>Tokay,</HI> and <HI>Zatmar.</HI> And there are yet out of their hands the three notablest Bulwarks of <HI>Chrislendom; Rab, Komara,</HI> and <HI>Leopoldstadt;</HI> all which I had the advantage to fee. This last has been erected since the loss of <HI>Newheusell;</HI> and made much after the same manner; consisting of Six regular <HI>Bastions revestues.</HI> It is seated on the West side of the River <HI>Waag▪</HI> over against <HI>Freistadt,</HI> not far from the place where the <HI>Tartars</HI> passed over in the last War, and destroyed a great part of the Country, and carried away many Cap∣tives from those Parts, and out of <HI>Moravia.</HI> This Fortisication was be∣gun in the year 1665, and was well advanced, but not finished when I was there, 1669. Count <HI>Souches</HI> the younger was then Governor thereof; from whom I received great Civility in that place; and a Guard of Foot Soldiers, to convoy me through the Contribution Coun∣try, towards <HI>Schemnitz, Cremnitz,</HI> and the other Mine Towns.</P>
<P>Many <HI>Roman Emperors</HI> have honoured these Quarters with their Pre∣sence, Birth, Death, or great Actions. For (to omit <HI>Trajan, Caracalla, Galienus, Constantius,</HI> and many more) the Emperors <HI>Aurelianus, Probus, Gratianus, Maximianus,</HI> had their Nativities at <HI>Sirmium;</HI> and <HI>Claudius Gothicus</HI> died in it, or near it. <HI>Jovianus,</HI> and <HI>Valentinianus</HI> were Born in <HI>Pannonia. Ingenuus,</HI> Governor of <HI>Pannonia,</HI> was saluted Emperor by the <HI>Moesian</HI> Legions. <HI>Vetranio</HI> likewise, in the same Country. And at <HI>Sirmium</HI> was held a General Council, when <HI>Photinus</HI> was Bishop of that place.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="9"/>
The <HI>Roman</HI> Armies being much in this Country, no wonder it is, that so many <HI>Coins</HI> of <HI>Copper, Gold,</HI> and <HI>Silver</HI> are to be found in it: Whereof I obtained no small number at <HI>Petronell,</HI> or Old <HI>Carnuntum,</HI> which was a Part of <HI>Pannonia.</HI> And at <HI>Sene,</HI> or <HI>Senia,</HI> situated near the <HI>Danube,</HI> I met with very many. They are also to be found at Old <HI>Buda,</HI> or <HI>Sicambria;</HI> at Old <HI>Sirmium</HI> in the Country, now called <HI>Schrem∣nia;</HI> at <HI>Mursa,</HI> or <HI>Esseck,</HI> and many other Parts. An <HI>Armenian</HI> Mer∣chant, in whose House I lodged at <HI>Belgrade,</HI> undertook to provide me with <HI>Roman</HI> Coins against my return: which he might well do about those Parts, as at <HI>Sirmium, Samandria,</HI> and other places. And not far from thence <HI>Lysimachus,</HI> King of <HI>Macedon</HI> and <HI>Thrace,</HI> is conceived to have kept his abode, at a Castle or Palace near <HI>Deva;</HI> where that un∣parallel'd mass of <HI>Gold Medals</HI> was found, as is particularly delivered by Monsieur <HI>Fumeé,</HI> in his Account of the Wars of <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>
<P>Near the Town of <HI>Deva</HI> or <HI>Devas,</HI> was found great store of <HI>Treasure,</HI> by the Peasants of the Country, under an Ancient Castle or Palace, all ruined and decayed. The Rain continuing a long time, and the Wa∣ter running with a forcible current, there was discovered an infinite company of <HI>Golden Medals:</HI> upon one side of which was Coined the Image of <HI>Lysimachus,</HI> on the other side a Victory; every one weighing two or three Crowns. The Storm and rage of water being past, and the Sun shining on these, made a marvellous glittering; which per∣ceived by the Peasants, they remained ravished with joy; and taking them up, they also found a <HI>Golden Serpent:</HI> which afterwards Gene∣ral <HI>Castalde</HI> sent unto <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> with a part of these Ancient <HI>Medals.</HI> This being an ancient Custom with those who buried their Treasure, to place <HI>Serpents</HI> there, in token of a Faithful keeper. After the Pea∣sants had taken, no man knew what, others took from thence more than Twenty thousand <HI>Ducats.</HI> And the report was, that they might have taken an hundred Thousand. For that had sometimes been the abode of King <HI>Lysimachus.</HI> Whereof <HI>Ferdinand</HI> had a Thousand, and <HI>Castalde</HI> three Hundred. Which Coin remained in this place from <HI>Lysimachus</HI>'s time. Among other notable Antiquities, there were also found two <HI>Medals</HI> of <HI>Gold,</HI> the one of <HI>Ninus,</HI> the other of <HI>Semiramis,</HI> which were sent to the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Fifth.</HI> And there was not any Man in all that Province, of what Authority or repu∣tation soever, who had not some of these <HI>Medals:</HI> so infinite was found this Sum to be.</P>
<P>In the Old <HI>Roman</HI> Towns, through which I passed, the People, upon notice given, would bring what Coins they had, called by them <HI>Heathen-money.</HI> In the Countries of <HI>Servia</HI> and <HI>Bosna,</HI> the <HI>Armenians</HI> and <HI>Jews</HI> make Collections, and send them to <HI>Ragusi;</HI> from whence the greatest part is carried into <HI>Italy.</HI> I must not omit one <HI>Copper</HI> Coin of the Emperor <HI>Julius Philippus,</HI> which I found common in those Parts, and very rare in others; it hath on the Obverse, the Head of <HI>Philippus,</HI> with this Inscription, <HI>I M P.

<P>This is the Habit of an <HI>Hungarian,</HI> which is found to be so fit and convenient for all sort of Exercise, especially on Horse∣back, and in War, that it is made use of also by the <HI>Croatians, Schlavonians,</HI> and other Nations, and by the <HI>Turks</HI> themselves who live near the Frontiers; although otherwise they seldom change their own Habits. The <HI>Hungarians</HI> delight most in Co∣lours, wearing Blew, Yellow, Green, and Purple Cloth; and it is

rare to see any one in Black; the Priests themselves being habited in long Purple Garments. The <HI>Hungarians</HI> usually carry in their hands, a Club, or Iron Mace, of which they have two sorts, a <HI>Cat∣shan,</HI> and a <HI>Delta,</HI> or <HI>Balta</HI> as they pronounce it. The <HI>Catshan</HI> hath a globular Iron head with furrows in it, and spaces cut away to render it more light, and easie to be handled; this is expressed in the Figure of the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Habit▪ the <HI>Delta</HI> hath a head some∣what like a Hammer, but broader, and at the end makes the shape of that Letter.</P>

<HEAD>A JOURNEY FROM Vienna in Austria, TO Larissa in Thessalia.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING passed the Winter in the Imperial City of <HI>VIENNA,</HI> I took a Journey into <HI>Hungary,</HI> to view the <HI>Copper, Silver,</HI> and <HI>Gold</HI> Mines in those Parts. And not long after, although I had already had a fair sight of <HI>Italy,</HI> I made a Journey unto <HI>VENICE,</HI> passing through <HI>Austria, Styria, Carinthia, Carniola,</HI> and <HI>Friuli;</HI> and soon after my return to <HI>Vienna,</HI> I met with an opportunity, which carried me unto the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Court, which then, and a long time be∣fore, resided at the famous Old City of <HI>LARISSA</HI> in <HI>Thessaly.</HI> You are not to expect the Names of all Places, which I passed; yet divers you will find mentioned, which are not to be found in Mapps; except you have some more exact, than any I have met with.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Presburg,</HI> above the confluence of the River <HI>Marck</HI> with the <HI>Danube,</HI> I could not but take notice of the Town of <HI>Petronell,</HI> and <HI>Haymburg</HI> Hill and Castle. <HI>Petronell</HI> is conceived to have been Old <HI>Carnuntum,</HI> a strong Hold of the <HI>Pannonians,</HI> in vain at∣tempted by the <HI>Romans,</HI> an Hundred and seventy years before the Incar∣nation; but was afterwards subdued, in the time of <HI>Augustus,</HI> made a <HI>Roman</HI> Colony; and the Station of the <HI>Legio decima quarta gemina,</HI> and the <HI>Classis Istrica;</HI> and in process of time so enlarged, that it be∣came the chief City of <HI>Pannonia</HI> Superior, and comprehended that tract on the South Bank of the <HI>Danube,</HI> wherein now stand <HI>Haymburg,</HI> Dutch <HI>Altenburg,</HI> and St. <HI>Petronell.</HI></P>
<P>I had been formerly at <HI>Petronell,</HI> to inform my self in the noble Ruines and Antiquities thereof; where I met with variety of <HI>Medals, Inscriptions,</HI> remainders of a noble <HI>Aquaeduct,</HI> and the Remains of a goodly Fabrick, which I thought might be the ruine of a Temple of <HI>Janus,</HI> but it is conceived to have been a Triumphal Arch, erected in Memory of a great Victory over the <HI>Pannonians,</HI> and <HI>Dalmatians,</HI> by <HI>Tiberius,</HI> in the Ninth year of our Lord. My noble Friend, <HI>Petrus Lambecius,</HI> hath set forth the Figure of one side thereof (in the Second

part of his <HI>Description of the Imperial Library,)</HI> and of the back part I took a Draught my self. This, and other <HI>Carnuntine</HI> Antiquities may be seen in the same Author; and more may be expected, when that Worthy Person shall please to Publish his <HI>Carnuntum re∣divivum.</HI></P>

<P>In this place, the Emperor <HI>Antoninus Philosophus,</HI> in order to his Wars with the <HI>Marcomanni,</HI> now <HI>Moravians,</HI> resided the space of Three years, and died at <HI>Vindobona,</HI> now <HI>Vienna:</HI> and here <HI>Severus</HI> was elected Emperor by the <HI>German</HI> Legions. But this Noble and Ancient City was ruined, in after-times, by <HI>Attila</HI> the <HI>Hunne,</HI> in his Incur∣sions into these Parts: Yet there are still remaining many marks of its Ancient Greatness. And though Grass now grows where Old <HI>Carnuntum</HI> stood; yet by an observing Eye, the Foundations of their Houses, and their Streets are still discoverable: and such great quan∣tities of <HI>Roman</HI> Coins have been of a long time, and are still found there, that the <HI>Boors</HI> are commonly well furnished with them; of whom I purchased a great number: and Mr. <HI>Donellan,</HI> an <HI>Irish</HI> Gen∣tleman, who then travelled with me, and was walking in my Com∣pany,
<PB N="16" REF="12"/>
viewing these Old Remains of former Greatness, by chance strook with his foot a <HI>Silver</HI> Coin out of the Earth.</P>
<P><HI>Presburg, Posonium, Pisonium,</HI> and by some thought to be <HI>Flexum,</HI> is a pleasant City seated on the North side of the <HI>Danube,</HI> ten <HI>German</HI> miles Eastward from <HI>Vienna,</HI> the chief City of <HI>Hungaria</HI> in the <HI>Impe∣perial Dominions</HI> thereof; since the loss of <HI>Buda,</HI> the place of Conven∣tion for the <HI>Estates;</HI> and since the loss of <HI>Strigonium,</HI> the <HI>Metropoli∣tan City.</HI> The <HI>City</HI> is pleasant; the <HI>Castle</HI> is stately, beautiful, and well situated on the top of a Hill, and built of White Stone; herein is kept the so highly esteemed Crown of <HI>Hungary,</HI> commonly believed to have been brought by an <HI>Angel</HI> from Heaven, unto St. <HI>Stephen</HI> their King; and is of a different figure from other Crowns. The <HI>Garden</HI> of the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> is very fair; the <HI>Walks,</HI> the <HI>Grotto</HI>'s, the figure of <HI>Jeronimo,</HI> the <HI>Labirynth, Fish-ponds,</HI> and <HI>Fountains</HI> are Noble. In the <HI>Dome,</HI> or <HI>Cathedral Church,</HI> lieth the Body of St. <HI>Johannes Eleemosyna∣rius,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Alexandria.</HI> The <HI>Jesuits</HI> have a part of the same Church, and a noble <HI>Apothecaries</HI> Shop, full of Rarities. The <HI>Lutherans</HI> have also a fair <HI>Church</HI> here.</P>
<P><HI>Rab,</HI> or <HI>Javrinum,</HI> a <HI>City</HI> seated at the confluence of the Rivers <HI>Rab, Rabnitz,</HI> and the <HI>Danube:</HI> and a strong Frontier Bulwark against the <HI>Turk.</HI> It hath two <HI>Bridges,</HI> one over a double Ditch, leading towards <HI>Austria;</HI> and another towards <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> or <HI>Stullweissenburg.</HI> It hath seven large <HI>Bastions,</HI> and four <HI>Cavalliers,</HI> or high Mounts, which over-look them. The first is the Castle <HI>Bastion,</HI> upon which stands the Castle or Palace of the Governour. The second is the Water <HI>Ba∣stion,</HI> lying towards the <HI>Danube.</HI> The third is the Bastion of the <HI>holy Hill,</HI> under which when the <HI>Turks</HI> sprang a Mine, a Horseman was blown off from the top of it into the <HI>Danube,</HI> without any hurt to him∣self or his Horse. The fourth is the middle Bastion, towards the Land Eastward. The fifth is the new Bastion. The sixth is the Imperial, or Empress Bastion. And the seventh is the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Bastion, lying next the River <HI>Rab,</HI> where the <HI>Turkish</HI> Governor was killed when the Town was surprised in the Night by the Christians. The Country is all plain about, and there is nothing which seems to command it, but a small Hill at some distance, which is undermined, and may be blown up upon any occasion; beyond which there is also a Tower or Spy in the open Fields, to discover the approach of the Enemy. It was Besieged by <HI>Sinan Bassa,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Sultan Amurah</HI> the Third; where he lost many Men, and at one assault Twelve thousand; but at last was Surrendred, by the Treachery of Count <HI>Hardeck,</HI> the Governor; which cost him his Head at <HI>Vienna;</HI> where, upon a Seaffold covered with black Velvet, kneeling by the side of a Table covered with a black Velvet Carpet, he laid his Hand upon the Table, and the Execu∣tioners at the same instant struck off both his Head and his Hand. In a few years after, it was recovered, by a notable surprise, acted by Count <HI>Swartzenburg,</HI> and Count <HI>Palfi,</HI> with a great slaughter of the <HI>Turks.</HI> I saw a part of the Gate, which was then broken by a <HI>Petard,</HI> the same being still kept for a Memorial, in a part of the Cathedral Church. While this place was in the <HI>Turks</HI> Possession, they made a Dungeon for Christian Prisoners, wherein there is no light, but what enters by a Grate upon the ground in the Market-place. But this is now seldom empty of <HI>Turks,</HI> begging the Charity of Passers-by, and selling neat Whips which they make in this their sad restraint.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="12"/>
He that would take a view of warlike Engines and Instruments, is not like to have better satisfaction any where, than at <HI>Rab</HI> and <HI>Koma∣ra,</HI> where he may take notice of one, called a morning Star, used by the Sentinels, and at an assault, defence of a breach, or entrance into a Town; of earthen Pots to throw amongst the Enemies, filled with sticking and burning materials. There he may also see a Lehn Brad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, or plank set with hooks, to be placed on the out-side of the works, covered lightly with earth; whereby those, who storm are wounded, and intangled. A werf Kugel, or instrument filled with wild fire, and combustible matter, to be thrown by the hand, it sticketh fast and burneth. A <HI>Spannische Ritter</HI> or <HI>Cheval de Frise,</HI> to be laid in the way, to keep out the Horse; divers sorts of Chain-shot, and the like.</P>
<P>General <HI>Montecuculi</HI> was the Governour of <HI>Raab,</HI> whose Pass I had the advantage of in the former year, to travel by these parts unto the Mine▪Towns. The Emperour being wearied with Chiauses, and ordi∣nary Envoys, which so often came to <HI>Vienna</HI> from the Visior of <HI>Buda,</HI> and expected presents at their return; hath taken order, that, without especial Licence, they shall come no further than <HI>Raab,</HI> but there re∣ceive their dispatches.</P>
<P><HI>Komora, Gomora, Crumenum</HI> or <HI>Comaronium,</HI> a large and strong Town at the East-end of the Island of <HI>Schut,</HI> looking over the <HI>Danube</HI> and <HI>Waag,</HI> strongly fortified, and well mann'd. Colonel <HI>Hoffkircher</HI> was then Governour: the strongest place is the <HI>Tortoise</HI> Fort; so called, from some resemblance it hath to a <HI>Tortoise.</HI> This Town, after the taking of <HI>Raab,</HI> was besieged by <HI>Sinan Bassa,</HI> with sixty Ships, and a great num∣ber of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars;</HI> but in vain, and to the great slaughter of the <HI>Tartars.</HI> Although the <HI>Bassa</HI> omitted nothing towards the gaining it, but employed treachery as well as force, and under colour of a Parley, sent five <HI>Turks</HI> to the Governour, Baron <HI>Brown,</HI> who had then received a great wound upon his right Knee, to try if he could by any means be wrought upon to deliver up the City. And the Governour gave them the hearing▪ till they had declared their whole treachery; but then pre∣sently commanded four of their Heads to be struck off, and to be set upon long Pikes upon one of the Bulwarks, for the <HI>Bassa</HI> to look upon; and sent the Fifth back to the <HI>Bassa</HI> to tell him that although he found one in <HI>Rab</HI> to serve his turn he was much deceived, if in him he thought to find Count <HI>Hardeck,</HI> and to assure him that he would never betray a City committed to his charge, but rather wished to dye the Empe∣rors true and faithful Servant imbrewed in the Blood of the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>In the inward Castle I observed three old Tombs, which had been formerly brought thither from <HI>Sene</HI> or <HI>Senia,</HI> a place of Antiquity, not farr off. Some in the Castle observing me to write out their Inscrip∣tions, were very inquisitive, and obliged me to leave a copy of them in the Castle; and if, upon after-consideration, I should find them to be of importance, required a promise of me, to send them an account thereof: The Inscriptions were these.</P>

<P>The third Tomb was of the same Figure, but without any Inscrip∣tion. I could not omit to set down these, because they are not to be met with in that great Volume of Inscriptions of <HI>Gruter.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gomora</HI> hath been of late more strongly fortified, and a greater com∣pass of ground is taken in, by a line drawn from the <HI>Waag</HI> to the <HI>Da∣nube,</HI> and fortified with four new Bastions.</P>
<P>Of some other places, near unto these already named, and whereof I took notice the year before, I shall make but short mention; as parti∣cularly of <HI>Newhewsell,</HI> by the <HI>Hungarians</HI> called <HI>Vywar,</HI> seated by the River <HI>Neutra,</HI> not far from <HI>Nitria,</HI> a strong place, and Bishops See, taken by Count de <HI>Souches</HI> in the last wars. <HI>Newhausl</HI> is a strong Hold, re∣gularly fortified with six large Bastions, which makes it lie in the form of a Star, it was surrendred after six storms unto the grand <HI>Visier;</HI> who presently besieged it, after that Count <HI>Forchatz,</HI> the Governour, had rashly lost a great part of his men at the Battel of <HI>Barchan;</HI> where the bones of the Slain lie yet in the Field. The <HI>Turkish Bassa</HI> lives in the Palace, which belonged to the Arch-bishop of <HI>Presburg,</HI> and has converted the Church into a <HI>Moschea.</HI> The <HI>Bassa</HI> growing too fami∣liar with the neighbour Governour of <HI>Komara,</HI> was jealously looked on by the Grand <HI>Seignior,</HI> who sent one to take of his head, and put ano∣ther into this Government. This place commands contribution from a good part of the Country between the River <HI>Waag</HI> and the <HI>Neutra,</HI> and between the <HI>Neutra</HI> and the River <HI>Gran:</HI> and in places, where we lodged in those parts, the Master of the house told us, he was obliged to give notice unto the <HI>Turks,</HI> who, and how many were in his house; whereof we were not unwilling, resolving to be gone, before the ac∣count thereof could come unto them. If the <HI>Visier</HI> had not spent time
<PB N="19" REF="13"/>
about the siege of <HI>Newhewsell,</HI> but marched into <HI>Austria,</HI> when the Emperour was yet unprovided, the Auxiliary forces farr off, and <HI>Vienna,</HI> and all the Country about in great fear, he might have probably left sad effects in those parts; but attempting some time after, to break into <HI>Austria</HI> by Saint <HI>Godard,</HI> when the Imperial forces were in readiness, and the great bodies of Auxiliaries of <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>French</HI> came up, he was repulsed with great loss of his best Soldiers, and readily clapt up a peace, which kept these parts in quiet for many years.</P>
<P><HI>Sene, Sone</HI> or <HI>Senia,</HI> a Village near the <HI>Danube,</HI> and remarkable place for variety of Antiquities, where, by the help of the <HI>Byro</HI> or <HI>Judge</HI> of the Town, I met with divers Coins, and some of Gold, some <HI>Intaglia's,</HI> and as they called it, a <HI>Heathen</HI> or <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>man</HI> Key. Whereof I presented some unto <HI>Petrus Lambecias,</HI> who shewed them unto the Emperor. This place, being in the contribution Country to the <HI>Turks,</HI> hath been little enquired into; and therefore the Antiquities thereof were the more welcome. Amongst all the Inscriptions of <HI>Gruter,</HI> I find but one or two of <HI>Senia.</HI> The People say, this place was formerly called <HI>Apollo∣nia,</HI> but without any good ground.</P>
<P>Passing from <HI>Raab</HI> to <HI>Dotis,</HI> St. <HI>Martinsberg</HI> offers it self to view; an handsome Town, and strong Hold, upon the top of a high Hill, over∣looking all the Country. This is still in the Christians hands, though it hath formerly been taken by the <HI>Turks,</HI> once in <HI>Amurath</HI> the third's time.</P>
<P><HI>Dotis, Tata,</HI> or <HI>Theodata,</HI> about twelve <HI>English</HI> miles from <HI>Gomora,</HI> where there is a Castle with a Ditch about it, and also some Natural Baths near it. It hath been often taken and retaken: <HI>Graff Zacki,</HI> a Noble <HI>Hungarian,</HI> was then Governor, whose singular Civilities I must always acknowledge; and indeed in these parts, I was at best con∣tent in the company of Souldiers, for they commanded all, and were generous and free hearted Persons, and could commonly speak either <HI>Latine, High-Dutch▪</HI> or <HI>Italian;</HI> my company was the more accepta∣ble to them, because I had seen many parts of <HI>Europe</HI> before, which they would much enquire after.</P>
<P>But to return into the <HI>road</HI> again; we parted from <HI>Comora,</HI> being towed by a <HI>Saick</HI> of twenty four oars. The <HI>Hungarians</HI> rowing up∣on one side, and the <HI>Germans</HI> on the other, they saluted the Fortress with two small Guns, which they carried at the head of the <HI>Saick,</HI> and so we passed by <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne, Nesmil, Rodwan,</HI> and came to <HI>Motch,</HI> the exact place of the Frontiers. Here we expected a <HI>Turkish</HI> Convoy; which coming betimes in the morning, we made ready for them; their Offi∣cers went first on shoar, then our <HI>Veyda</HI> or <HI>Veyuod</HI> with the Interpre∣ter, and chiefest of the company, both parties walking slowly, and at meeting gave hands to one another, then we delivered our Boat unto the <HI>Turks,</HI> which they fastned to their <HI>Saick,</HI> and sent one i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to our Boat to steer it: and turning about, saluted the Christians with one Gun, and then with eighteen Oars rowed down the <HI>Danube,</HI> we carrying the <HI>Eagle</HI> in our <HI>Flag,</HI> they the <HI>Double Sword, Star,</HI> and <HI>Half-Moon.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Turkish Saick</HI> convoyed us to <HI>Strigonium</HI> or <HI>Gran,</HI> and set our Boat on shoar in the Town, and so left us; the Governor also took no notice of us, either in hopes of a present, or some private interest; but an <HI>Aga,</HI> who came with four troops of Horse from <HI>Newhewsell,</HI> being
<PB N="20" REF="14"/>
come into the Castle, asked the Governor (as we were informed by a <HI>Turk,</HI> that came unto us) what he meaned to have so little care of his head, to deal with us after this manner? who were not sent to him, or to a <HI>Bassa,</HI> or a <HI>Visier,</HI> but to the <HI>Sultan,</HI> and no doubt had a Pre∣sent for him: whereupon we were soon dispatched.</P>
<P>This City of <HI>Gran, Strigonium</HI> or <HI>Ostrogon,</HI> is seated on the South∣side of the <HI>Danube</HI> near the Confluence with the River <HI>Gran,</HI> divided into the upper and lower, and both walled; the lower <HI>Wall</HI> doth well command the <HI>Danube.</HI> St. <HI>Thomas Hill,</HI> hard by the Town, is also walled, because it commandeth the Town: There are in this place Natural Baths of a moderate heat. This hath been the Metropolitan City of <HI>Hungary,</HI> where St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> the first Christian King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> was born; and King <HI>Stephen</HI> the third buried.</P>
<P>Scarce any place has suffered more strong and notable Sieges; be∣sieged in vain by <HI>John,</HI> King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> taken by <HI>Solyman,</HI> recover∣ed by Count <HI>Mansfelt</HI> for <HI>Matthias,</HI> the Arch-Duke; besieged again in vain, but taken in the time of <HI>Sultan Achmet,</HI> by the mutinous base∣ness of the Christian Defendants, who shutting up Count <HI>Dampier,</HI> the Governor, delivered the place unto <HI>Aly-Beg</HI> the <HI>Turkish</HI> General; but after many years it was taken again by the Christians under the Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> in the year 1683. Over against <HI>Strigonium</HI> lieth <HI>Barchan;</HI> between these two places there is a Bridge of Boats.</P>
<P>From <HI>Strigonium</HI> we passed to <HI>Vicegrade</HI> or <HI>Vizzegrade:</HI> The upper Castle of this place is seated upon a very high Rock, where the Crown of <HI>Hungary</HI> hath been formerly kept: the lower Castle hath been fair; there is also a handsome Fabrick of square Stones, and Arches, the ruines whereof do still remain: this place was retaken from the <HI>Turks</HI> by the Forces of the Arch-Duke <HI>Matthias,</HI> in the time of <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Third, but betrayed, and delivered up by the Treachery of the <HI>Heyducks</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Sultan Achmet. Charles</HI> King of <HI>Naples,</HI> and sworn King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> was wounded on the head by <HI>Forchatz;</HI> and being carried into the Castle, under pretence of laying a Plaster on his head, was strangled. This place yielded to the Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> 1684.</P>
<P>Over against <HI>Vizzegrade</HI> lieth <HI>Maroz,</HI> where there is a large Church; and the place having voluntarily submitted unto the <HI>Turks,</HI> the Chri∣stians paying a small Tribute, lived under no great oppression. Be∣low this Town, the <HI>Danube</HI> divides, and makes a fair large Island, called St. <HI>Andrews</HI> Island, still rowing down, by which we passed by <HI>Virovichitz,</HI> a noted place for pleasant Vineyards and good Grapes, and an old ruine of Stone, upon the shoar of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> Isle, where the <HI>Turks</HI> told us, there was formerly a Stone Bridge, we came to <HI>Vacia,</HI> in for∣mer times a Bishop See, which hath now two <HI>Mosches,</HI> and one Christian Church without the Wall. This place was seized upon, sacked and burnt by the <HI>Turks,</HI> 1541. but taken by the Emperors Forces, under the Command of the Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> in the Year 1684. after he had overthrown the <HI>Turks</HI> in Battel near the Town, but was quitted again at the latter end of the <HI>Autumn,</HI> there being a ridge of Hills near it which over-look the Town, and render it not easie to be defended.</P>
<P>Here we changed our Convoy again, and passed unto <HI>Buda,</HI> the Capital City, and Royal Seat of the Kings of <HI>Hungaria,</HI> and the resi∣dence of a <HI>Turkish Visier,</HI> who hath divers <HI>Bassa's</HI> under him. It is a large City, and of a pleasant situation; devided into the upper and
<PB N="21" REF="14"/>
lower Town, wherein are some ruines, and reliques of Magnificent Structures, rais'd by the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Kings, especially <HI>Matthias Corvi∣nus,</HI> whose Palace the <HI>Visier</HI> possessed. But much abating of its anci∣ent glory. There are also some fair <HI>Mosches, Caravansara's,</HI> and very Magnificent <HI>Baths.</HI> There is also a high Hill called St. <HI>Gerard</HI>'s Mount, which hath a Fort on the top, and over-looks the Town and Coun∣try.</P>
<P>The natural Baths of <HI>Buda</HI> are esteemed the noblest of <HI>Europe,</HI> not only in respect of the large and hot Springs, but the Magnificence of their Buildings. For the <HI>Turks</HI> bathe very much, and though little cu∣rious in most of their private houses, yet are they very sumptuous in their publick Buildings, as their <HI>Chars</HI> or <HI>Caravansara's, Mosches, Bridges,</HI> and <HI>Baths</HI> declare.</P>
<P>There are eight Baths, whereof I had opportunity to take notice during my stay at <HI>Buda,</HI> three toward the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>South-East</HI> part of the City, in the way leading towards <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and five towards the <HI>West</HI> end of the Town, in the way towards old <HI>offen,</HI> and <HI>Stri∣gonium.</HI></P>
<P>The first is a large open Bath at the foot of a high rocky Hill, cal∣led Purgatory, whereof the People have some odd and scrupulous Ap∣prehensions.</P>
<P>The second is covered with a <HI>Cupola,</HI> and stands nigh the same Hill, but more into the Town, and near a place where they use Tanning.</P>
<P>The third is called the <HI>Bath</HI> of the green Pillars, though at present they be of a red colour, it stands over against a <HI>Caravansara.</HI> The Water is hot but tolerable without the Addition of cold water, it is impregnated with a petrefiing Juyce, which discovers it self on the sides of the <HI>Bath,</HI> upon the Spouts, and other places, and makes a grey Stone: The Exhalation from the <HI>Bath</HI> reverberated by the <HI>Cupola,</HI> by the Irons extended from one Column to another, and by the Capitals of the Pillars forms long Stones like <HI>Isicles,</HI> which hang to all these places.</P>
<P>The Water is let out at night, when the Women have done bathing, who often stay late. The <HI>Bath</HI> is round, set about with large Pillars supporting a <HI>Cupola,</HI> which hath openings to let out the Steam, and yet the whole Room continues to be a hot Stove.</P>
<P>The <HI>Baths</HI> of the <HI>West</HI> end of the Town are first, <HI>Tactelli,</HI> or the <HI>Bath</HI> of the Table, a small <HI>Bath</HI> covered: the Water white, and of a Sulphureous smell; they drink of this as well as bathe in it; what they drink they receive from a Spout, bringing the Water into this place. I delivered a five-Sols piece to a <HI>Turk,</HI> who was bathing in it, to gild for me, which he did in half a Minute, by rubbing it between his fingers, while the hot Water fell from the Spout upon it.</P>
<P>The second is <HI>Barat Degrimene,</HI> or the Bath of the Powder-Mill, it rises in an open Pond near the High-way, and mixes with the fresh Springs, which makes the Pond of a whitish colour in one part, and clear in the other; as also cold and hot in several parts. This convey∣ed cross the High-way into a Powder Mill, becomes useful in making of Gun-powder.</P>
<P>The third is <HI>cuzzoculege,</HI> the little Bath, or the Bath of the <HI>Saint,</HI> for which name the <HI>Turks</HI> give a superstitious reason: It is kept by <HI>Turkish</HI> Monks. The Bath where the Springs arise, is so hot as scarce

to be endured; but being let out into another bathing place at some distance, it becomes tolerable and fit for use. This Water hath neither colour, smell, nor taste different from common Water, and deposeth no sediment, only the sides of the Bath are green, and have a fungous sub∣stance all over.</P>
<P>The fourth is <HI>Caplia,</HI> a very noble Bath, but part of the Buildings was consumed this year, 1669. by a great Fire that happened in <HI>Buda,</HI> but is since repaired by the <HI>Turks.</HI> The Water is very hot, not without a petrefying Juyce in it. The Building about is eight square, with a noble Bath in the middle, with a Circle of a Trench of Water about it for the better Ornament, to bathe the feet in; on every side it hath a <HI>Niche,</HI> wherein is a Fountain; in the middle of the Anti-Chamber, where they leave their Cloths, there is also a fair Stone Bason and a Fountain.</P>
<P>The fifth is the Bath of <HI>Ʋelibey,</HI> which hath a strong sulphureous smell; and a petrefying Juyce in it, and is so hot, that to make it tolerable it requires the addition of cold Water; this is the noblest of all. The Anti-Chamber is ve y large, the Bath-Room capacious, and high-Arch∣ed, adorned with five <HI>Cupola</HI>'s; one a very fair one over the great round Bath in the middle; and one lesser over each of the four corners, where are either Baths, or Bath-stoves for private use: in these the <HI>Turks</HI> take off the hair of their Bodies by a <HI>Psilothrum</HI> mixt with <HI>Soap:</HI> it being not their Custom to have any hair, except their Beards. Twelve Pillars support the great <HI>Cupola,</HI> between eight whereof are Fountains of hot Water, and between the others are places to sit down, where the Barbers and Bath-men attend; and each of these places has two Cisterns of <HI>Free-stone,</HI> into which are let in hot Bath-water, and al∣so cold Water, to be mixed and tempered as every one pleaseth.</P>
<P>Men bathe in the Morning, and Women in the Afternoon. When any man intends to bathe, having entred the first Rooms, he finds there divers Servants attending, who furnish him with a Cloth and Apron. Then he puts off his Cloths and having put on the Apron, he enters the second Room, wherein is the great Bath, and sits on the side of the Bath, or between the Pillars near a Fountain, where the Barber strongly rubs him with his hand opened, stretching out his Armes, and lifting them up; after which the Party bathes. Then if he be a Subject of the grand <HI>Seignior</HI>'s, or it be the Custom of his Country, he hath his head shaved, and if a young man, his beard, ex∣cept the upper Lip; next the Barber rubs his Breast, Back, Armes, and Legs, with an hair Cloth, while he either sitteth, or lieth with his face downward, then washes his head with <HI>Soap,</HI> and after throws cold Wa∣ter upon him, all over his Body, and then he walks in the steam of the Bath for a time.</P>
<P>The <HI>Germans</HI> call this City <HI>Offen,</HI> and some will have it founded by <HI>Buda,</HI> the Brother of <HI>Attila,</HI> the Famous King of the <HI>Hunnes.</HI> And to speak the truth among all the numerous Countries, and Places Conquered by that Warlike Nation, they could not choose out indeed a nobler Seat to build a City in, where, besides the advantage of their natural Baths and Stoves, this being placed upon the Banks of the greatest River in <HI>Europe,</HI> where it runs in one entire Stream, and the City rising up by degrees to the top of Hills, affording from most Streets of the Town, a Prospect of twenty Miles or more, on the other side of

the <HI>Danube,</HI> as far as ones eye can reach, with the view of <HI>Pest,</HI> and the long Bridge of Boats, and the beautiful fruitful Country about it, renders it most exquisitely pleasant and delightful, and was the Royal Seat of the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Kings and Queens, till that <HI>Solyman</HI> the Mag∣nificent, entered it with his Sons <HI>Selimus</HI> and <HI>Bajazet,</HI> on the Thir∣teenth of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ugust,</HI> in the Year One Thousand Five Hundred Forty One, and made a Decree that <HI>Buda</HI> should be from that day kept by a Gar∣rison of <HI>Turks,</HI> and the Kingdom converted into a Province of the <HI>Tur∣kish</HI> Empire and the Queen and her young Son, be sent into the Coun∣try of <HI>Lippa,</HI> beyond the River <HI>Tibiscus,</HI> at a little distance from <HI>Buda</HI> or <HI>Offen:</HI> there is another Place called old <HI>Offen,</HI> conceived to be <HI>Si∣cambria</HI> of old, where the <HI>Sicambrian</HI> Souldiers quartered, in the time of the <HI>Romans:</HI> and some Antiquities and Inscriptions have been taken notice of in that place.</P>
<P>Over against <HI>Buda,</HI> upon the <HI>Eastern-shoar</HI> of <HI>Danubius,</HI> stands the City <HI>Pest,</HI> being Quadrangular and seated upon a Plain: and by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eason of its Wall, and the Towers of the <HI>Mosches;</HI> makes a handsom show from <HI>Buda.</HI> It gives the name unto the County or <HI>Comi∣tatus Pesthiensis: Hungaria</HI> being divided into Counties, like <HI>England;</HI> between this place and <HI>Buda,</HI> the handsom Bridge of Boats, is above half a Mile long.</P>
<P>The habit of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Women seemed new and strange to me: Breeches almost to their feet, a kind of Smock over them, and then a long Gown with their Head-dress, which setches about, covering their face, except their eyes, and makes them look like Penitents: but it was not unpleasant unto me, as taking away the occasion of Pride and Folly: though otherwise it can have no good grace in a stran∣ger's fancy.</P>
<P>During our Stay at <HI>Buda,</HI> we went into a <HI>Turkish</HI> Convent, where the Prior or Superior called <HI>Julpapa,</HI> or Father of the <HI>Rose,</HI> with some of his Brethren brought us into a large Room like a Chappel, and en∣tertained us with Melons and Fruit: at parting, we gratified them with some pieces of Silver, which were kindly accepted. The <HI>Julpapa</HI> had his Girdle or Ceinture embossed before with a whitish Stone, big∣ger than the palm of my hand, which was <HI>Galactites</HI> or <HI>Milk-stone;</HI> whereof they have a great opinion, because in their belief, <HI>Mahomet</HI> turned a whole River in <HI>Arabia</HI> into this kind of <HI>Stone.</HI></P>
<P>We lodged at an old <HI>Rascians</HI> house, where we were well accom∣modated; having from it a fair Prospect over the <HI>Danube,</HI> the long <HI>Bridge</HI> and <HI>Pest,</HI> and a good part of the Country. Divers <HI>Turks</HI> and some <HI>Chiauses</HI> resorted unto us, where they were treated to their con∣tent. The Master of the House was thought to hold secret corre∣spondence with a <HI>Franciscan</HI> Friar of <HI>Pest,</HI> and to give intelligence of Occurrences unto the Ministers of State at <HI>Gomora, Rab,</HI> and <HI>Vienna;</HI> he prevailed with me to pen a Letter in <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Italian;</HI> wherein I was not unwilling to gratisie him, because it contained nothing, be∣sides an account of some Prisoners, and the encroachment of the <HI>Ar∣menian</HI> Merchants upon the Trade.</P>
<P>As we were riding in the City, divers of the common <HI>Turks</HI> murmu∣red, that we should ride, where they went on foot. But I was pleased to see many <HI>Turks</HI> to salute Seiginor <HI>Gabriel,</HI> the Emperors Courrier, in our Company, and to take his hand, and put it to their foreheads,

but was much more delighted with the courteous entertainment of <HI>Mor∣tizan Ephendi,</HI> a person of note, and who had been an Envoy extraordi∣nary at <HI>Vienna.</HI> He received us in an handsom large Room, and treated us with great kindness; saying, that he desired our company, not to any Feast, but to a Treat of Affection and Respect; such as might declare, that we had conversed like friends, and eat and drunk together; he called for a stool, that I might sit down, it being then uneasie to me to sit cross-legged, and asked me, whether I would learn the <HI>Turkish</HI> Language, or whether I would go to the Port, and how I liked <HI>Buda,</HI> and among other questions, asked, what was the King of <HI>Poland</HI>'s name? and when I told him, <HI>Michael Wisnowitski;</HI> his reply was s mewhat strange unto me; saying, <HI>Michael,</HI> that's a good name, that's the name of the greatest Saint in Heaven, except <HI>Mary;</HI> and so having entertained us, he dismissed us with good wishes. At our return to this place, after two days stay, the Governor sent us with four and twenty Horse Souldiers into Christendom again, these guarded us with great care, a day and a night, till they saw us safe at <HI>Dotis.</HI></P>
<P>But now leaving <HI>Buda,</HI> we travelled by Land Eastward; and passing by the ruines of the King of <HI>Hungary</HI>'s Mint-house, by <HI>Ham Zabbi Palanka,</HI> and by <HI>Erzin,</HI> we came to <HI>Adom,</HI> in <HI>Turkish, Tzan Kurteran,</HI> or <HI>anima liberata,</HI> so named by <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent; because, in his hasty retreat from <HI>Vienna,</HI> he first made a quiet stop at this place, and there could think himself secure from any pursuit of the imperial Forces. This place was afterwards taken by <HI>Graff Palsi,</HI> from thence we came to <HI>Pentole</HI> or <HI>Pentolen Palanka.</HI> This or <HI>Adom</HI> is conceived to be the old <HI>Potentiana,</HI> where the <HI>Hunnes,</HI> invading those parts, fought a bloody Battel with the <HI>Romans,</HI> under the conduct of <HI>Macrinus</HI> and <HI>Tetricus,</HI> but were overthrown.</P>
<P>From hence to <HI>Fodwar,</HI> in sight of <HI>Colocza,</HI> seated on the other side of the <HI>Danube,</HI> in the road to <HI>Temeswar,</HI> formerly an Arch-Bishops See; whereof <HI>Tomoreus</HI> was Bishop, whose rashness conferred much unto the loss of <HI>Hungary,</HI> at the Battel of <HI>Mohatz.</HI> Then by <HI>Pax</HI> or <HI>Paxi</HI> unto <HI>Tolna,</HI> formerly <HI>Altinum</HI> or <HI>Altinium,</HI> where the <HI>Hunnes</HI> being recruited, fought a second Battel, obtained the Victory, and expulsed the <HI>Romans,</HI> though not without the loss of forty thousand of their own men. This hath been a very great place, but burnt by the Christians. The <HI>Hungarians</HI> and <HI>Rascians,</HI> who inhabit here, li∣ving in no good agreement.</P>
<P>Thence to <HI>Jeni Palanka,</HI> where we passed the River <HI>Sarvizza,</HI> former∣ly <HI>Ʋrpanus,</HI> a handsom River, arising near <HI>Vesprinium,</HI> and passing <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> or <HI>Stullweissenburg,</HI> the ancient place of Sepulture of the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Kings, which makes a triangle with <HI>Buda</HI> and <HI>Strigonium,</HI> and running into the <HI>Danube</HI> below. From thence by <HI>Setzwar</HI> to <HI>Bo∣toseck,</HI> where we travelled by night, and had a Horse-guard of <HI>Spahies,</HI> till we came to <HI>Setz,</HI> a large Town; where I observed the ruines of an old Castle, and a round Palesado upon the Hill.</P>
<P>Here is also a new <HI>Chan</HI> or <HI>Caravansara;</HI> then to <HI>Mohatz.</HI> Before we came to this place▪ we passed by a small Bridge over the Brook <HI>Cu∣rasse;</HI> which, upon great rains, over-flows the Neighbour parts; near which <HI>Ludovicus</HI> the unfortunate King of <HI>Hungary</HI> perished, be∣ing stifled in a muddy place, where his Horse plunged, after the Battel fought with the Forces of <HI>Solyman,</HI> on the other side of the Town.
<PB N="25" REF="16"/>
We went to see the place, where so noble a Prince lost his life, and an inconsiderate Battel lost the Crown of <HI>Hungary.</HI> This Battel was fought the 29th day of <HI>October,</HI> in the Year 1526. <HI>Cotriscus,</HI> who was near the King's Person when he was drowned, related the manner of it to the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> and shewed them the place where he fell in, from whence the King's Body was afterwards taken up entire, and carried to <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> where with great Solemnity it was buried among the Sepulchres of the other Kings of <HI>Hungary,</HI> his Prede∣cessors.</P>
<P>Hereabouts we met with a Caravan of two or three hundred Per∣sons, some going to a place of Devotion, and having <HI>Janizaries</HI> with them, to guard them: others intending, by permission, to seat them∣selves in other parts of <HI>Hungary.</HI> And in divers places I met with numerous droves of Oxen, driven towards <HI>Vienna,</HI> upon the account of the Eastern Company of that City, who furnish that place and Country about, and are permitted to pass free by the <HI>Grand Seignior.</HI> This day we le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <HI>Quinque Ecclesiae,</HI> and <HI>Zigeth</HI> on the right hand, this last is a strong place seated by the side of a Fenn, in which there is an Island, and beyond that a Castle. Count <HI>Sereni</HI> defended this Place against the <HI>Turks,</HI> with unparalleled Bravery, and when he had lost the Town, retired into the Island, and last of all into the Castle, and when there were but four and twenty of them left alive, they all Sallied out together, choosing rather to die every man, than to give <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent, who besieged them, any pretence to the Town, by their Surrender; and <HI>Solyman</HI> himself died likewise in the Camp, and hath a Sword hanging by his Tomb in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> as a peculiar honour to him, in regard that he did not only spend a great part of his life, but also died in War.</P>
<P>From hence by <HI>Barinowar Darda</HI> or <HI>Draza</HI> unto <HI>Esseck</HI> or <HI>Osseck,</HI> conceived to be old <HI>Mursa,</HI> or not far from it. It is seated low, and the Streets are planked with Trees. Upon one side of the Gate is part of a <HI>Roman</HI> Inscription. M. AELIAN, &amp;c. on the other side, a Maids head in a Stone; there is also a Dyal, which is not ordinary, brought from <HI>Serinwar;</HI> and the greatest piece of Ordnance, which I saw in all those parts, not lying upon a Carriage, but upon Bodies of Trees. But that which is most remarkable here, is the well contrived Bridge of Wood, made partly over the River <HI>Dravus,</HI> and partly over the Fenns adjoyning, being five Miles long: being rayled, and having Towers at every quarter of a Mile: that part over the River <HI>Dravus,</HI> was burnt down by Count <HI>Nicolas Serini,</HI> in the last Wars, and ano∣ther built since. He that beholds this Bridge, the Towers of Wood upon it, the strong rayles and floar, and the numerous supporters of it, cannot but wonder, how they should be supplied with Wood to build it, or maintain it. But hereof I speak elsewhere, this is the greatest Passage in <HI>Hungary,</HI> from <HI>Servia,</HI> and the <HI>Turkish</HI> Dominions. Had this been well defended, when <HI>Solyman</HI> invaded <HI>Hungary,</HI> he had not probably obtained so easie a March unto <HI>Buda.</HI> And to hinder the Supply of the Grand <HI>Visiers</HI> Army from other parts of <HI>Turky,</HI> Count <HI>S rini</HI> burned down that part, which was built over the <HI>Dravus;</HI> and in his return burnt <HI>Quinque Ecclesiae</HI> or the City of five Churches, which lieth Westward from <HI>Esseck.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="17"/>
From thence we came to <HI>Valcovar,</HI> where there is a handsom wood∣en Bride over the River <HI>Walpo</HI> or <HI>Valpanus,</HI> plentiful of Fish; and upon which, to the Westward, stands the Town of <HI>Walpo,</HI> taken by the <HI>Turks</HI> in the Year 1545. by the Treachery of the Dependants, after that it held out three M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nths under the Command of <HI>Perennus</HI>'s Lady and Friends, and the Garrison was notwithstanding put to the Sword. Then by <HI>Sotzin Palanka,</HI> and <HI>Towarnick</HI> or <HI>Tabornick,</HI> to <HI>Metrouitza</HI> a large Town, and a great place for a Fair, strengthned by the adjacent Lake. So to <HI>Simonovitz,</HI> leaving at a good distance on the right hand the famous old <HI>Sirmium,</HI> now an inconsiderable place, whereof I have also said somewhat elsewhere. They call this Country <HI>Schremnia;</HI> and that, more near the <HI>Dravus, Bossega.</HI></P>
<P>In this Country many Families, and the Inhabitants of divers little Towns, live all under ground. I had formerly read of <HI>Troglodytes</HI> and subterraneous Nations, about <HI>Aegypt;</HI> but I was much surprized to see the like in this place, and could not but say unto my self:</P>
<LG>
<L>Now I believe the <HI>Troglodytes</HI> of old,</L>
<L>Whereof <HI>Herodotus</HI> and <HI>Strabo</HI> told;</L>
<L>Since every wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, about these parts, in holes,</L>
<L>Cunicular men I find, and humane Moles.</L>
</LG>
<P>Near these Habitations are Wells, to supply them with Water; which they draw up, like Dyers and Brewers: and Dogs come out upon Strangers. As we travelled by them, the poor Christians would be∣take themselves to their holes, like Conies. So that to satisfie our curi∣osities, we were fain to alight, and enter their houses, which we found better than we expected, divided into partitions, with Wooden Chim∣neys, and a Window at the farther end, a little above the ground: and all things as neatly disposed, as in other poor houses a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove ground; although but meanly, after the fashion of those parts. Their Speech is a Dialect of the <HI>Schlavonian.</HI> Then travelling on between the <HI>Danu∣bius</HI> and the <HI>Savus,</HI> we came to <HI>Zemlin</HI> upon the <HI>Danul e;</HI> from whence we had a fair Prospect of <HI>Belgrade,</HI> into the Castle of <HI>Zemlin, Ste∣phen,</HI> the usurping King, retired, and died. From hence we passed by Water unto <HI>Belgrade. Belgrade, Taurunum, Alba Graeca, Greek-Weissenburg,</HI> or <HI>Nandor Alba,</HI> as the <HI>Hungarians</HI> call it, it is a large, strong, popu∣lous, and great Trading City, in <HI>Servia,</HI> or <HI>Moesia</HI> Superior, seated at the Confluence of the River <HI>Savus,</HI> and <HI>Danubius:</HI> having the first on the West, the other on the North. The <HI>Danubius</HI> is here very broad, runs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uriously, and seems to cut off the <HI>Savus,</HI> as the <HI>Rhosne</HI> doth the <HI>Soane,</HI> by <HI>Lyon</HI> in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The Water of the <HI>Danube</HI> seems more white and yellow, troubled, and more confused.

That of the <HI>Savus,</HI> darker, greenish and clear; at the entrance of the <HI>Savus,</HI> there is an Island, on which there is now much Wood, although it be not older than five and thirty years; about which time, since the silt of both streams so s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttled, as to appear first above Water.</P>

Arriving at <HI>Belgrade,</HI> I passed by the Water Castle▪ and afterwards by the upper Castle, both large, and having many Towers; The Streets, where the greatest Trade is driven, are covered over with Wood, as in divers other Trading Places; so that they are not offended with the Sun, or Rain. They consist commonly of Shops which are but small; and no other, than a Taylors Shop-board, placed low; upon which, after the same manner, the Shop-keeper sits, and selleth his wares to his Chapman without, few or none entring in. I saw also two large places built of stone, like unto the Exchange with two rows of Pillars over one another; but they were so full of Merchants Goods, that they lost much of their beauty. There are also two large <HI>Bezestens,</HI> or places, where the richest Commodities are sold. They are built in the form of a Cathedral Church, and within are like to the old Exchange, above stairs. The Grand <HI>Visier</HI> hath built a noble <HI>Caravansara</HI> in this City, with a Fountain in the Court, and near unto it a <HI>Moschea,</HI> with a Fountain before it: which was the first <HI>Moschea,</HI> which I had the opportunity to see within-side. He hath also built a <HI>Metreseck</HI> or College for Students, I saw a Stu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent habited in green, and wearing a Turbant with four Corners, different from others, which is a peculiar distinction. Although near to most Towns there be Sepulchres to be seen, yet I observed them to be most numerous at <HI>Belgrade,</HI> as being very populous, and the Plague having been lately in it.</P>
<P>We lodged at an <HI>Armenian</HI> Merchant's house, where we were hand∣somly accommodated. And we visited divers others, who had built them fair houses; one, in which there was a Fountain and handsom Bath, and Stoves, where we wanted not <HI>Coffee, Sherbet,</HI> and excellent Wines; such as the Neighbour Country affords. These <HI>Armenians</HI> are dispersed into all Trading Places, and have a Church here at <HI>Belgrade,</HI> and seem to be more plain dealing, and reasonable men to buy any thing of than either <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Greeks.</HI></P>
<P>The Countries about have a great Trade unto this place: the <HI>Raguse∣ans</HI> Trade here, and the Eastern Merchants of <HI>Vienna</HI> have a Factory in this City. And surely <HI>Belgrade</HI> is as well seated for Trade, as any in-land place in <HI>Europe,</HI> for being situated upon the Confluence of the <HI>Danubius,</HI> and the <HI>Savus,</HI> having the great River <HI>Tibiscus</HI> running into the <HI>Danule</HI> near it; the <HI>Dravus</HI> not very far from it, and the River <HI>Morava</HI> not far below it; the <HI>Danube</HI> also flowing forward unto the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea, it may hold no uneasie Commerce with many remote parts. And <HI>Servia</HI> being a fruitful and pleasant Country consisting of Plains, Woods, and Hills, which might afford good Metals, not without stout Men, good Horses, Wines and Rivers, if it were in the Christians hands of the temper of those in the Western part of <HI>Europe,</HI> it might make a very flourishing Country.</P>
<P>This place hath formerly been the Bulwark of <HI>Hungary,</HI> in vain be∣sieged by <HI>Amurath</HI> the second, and again by <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Great, who was repulsed by the valour of <HI>Hunniades,</HI> and the Auxiliaries, raised by Friar <HI>Capiftranus:</HI> when <HI>Hunniades</HI> issuing forth, and encamping out of the City, beat away the <HI>Turkish</HI> Forces with great slaughter: where <HI>Mahomet</HI> himself was wounded in the breast, lost his Ordnance, and two hundred Ships were overthrown, by a Fleet, which came from <HI>Buda;</HI> but, being unprovided, it was since taken by <HI>Solyman</HI> the Mag∣nificent, in the second Year of his Reign, in the Year of our Lord 1521. and in no likelihood to be recovered.</P>

Leaving <HI>Belgrade,</HI> we proceeded in <HI>Servia,</HI> and pa ssed by a very high Hill, called <HI>Havilleck,</HI> on the South or right hand, where are still the ruines of an old Monastery, and came unto <HI>Hissargick,</HI> nigh the <HI>Danube;</HI> which, in Maps, is commonly placed too far from it. Here we took leave of that noble River, which by this time hath run a long course; and from <HI>Ʋlme,</HI> in <HI>Schwabenlandt,</HI> where it begins to be navi∣gable, about nine hundred Miles: but more from its first source and orignal; and hath a long space yet to run, before it enters the <HI>Eux∣ine.</HI> Next to <HI>Collar,</HI> not far from <HI>Samandria,</HI> an old habitation and <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Colony, but now a place of no great remark. It fell into the hands of the <HI>Turks</HI> in the time of <HI>Amurath</HI> the first, and was given to the Christians again by his Son <HI>Sultan Bajazet,</HI> for <HI>Lazarus Despot</HI> of <HI>Ser∣via</HI> being slain in Battel, left a mournful Widow. <HI>Stephen</HI> his Eldest Son, and a fair Daughter, and their Family being then in great distress, they sent Ambassadors to <HI>Sultan Bajazet,</HI> with rich Presents and great Offers which pleased him well, but above all he was marvellously taken with the incomparable beauty of the fair <HI>Despoina,</HI> at the same time presented to him by her Mother the <HI>Despotin,</HI> who had formerly promised her to him, upon which he not only granted them peace for the present, but in return thereof bestowed upon them the pleasant City of <HI>Semandria.</HI> The beautiful <HI>Despoina</HI> after this when <HI>Bajazet</HI> was overthrown, and shut up in an Iron Cage, was suddenly taken Prisoner in the City of <HI>Prusa</HI> in <HI>Asia Minor</HI> by <HI>Axalla,</HI> one of the Gene∣rals to <HI>Tamerlane,</HI> and carried far away, into the Eastern Parts of the World, but however it came to pass She was afterwards brought back again, and now lies buried by the Tomb of <HI>Sultan Bajazet</HI> at <HI>Brusia:</HI> From hence to <HI>Hassan Bassa Palanka,</HI> about forty <HI>English</HI> miles from <HI>Belgrade:</HI> perhaps so called from <HI>Hassan Bassa</HI> a famous <HI>Turkish</HI> Gene∣ral. Here I could not but take notice of an handsome Antiquity in Stone, of a Lyon worrying a Wolf.</P>
<P>From thence to <HI>Baditzna,</HI> where the Womens dress began to change, and was somewhat odd unto me. They wear a kind of Canopy on their heads; which is set about, as also their foreheads, with all sorts of mony, which they can get of Strangers. We left some small pieces a∣mong them, to add unto that curiosity: in this kind of Ornament I have seen some <HI>Graecian Women</HI> very rich, and somewhat after this fashi∣on, but their head-dress not raised so high, having their foreheads co∣vered with Ducats of Gold, and Pearl.</P>

<P>We passed on to <HI>Jagodna,</HI> pleasantly seated, and in a fair Country, whence setting forwards, after a few hours we turned Southward, and soon after, upon the side of an Hill, upon the right hand, I saw the Tomb of a <HI>Turkish</HI> Saint, about four yards long, and a square covered place by it: here our <HI>Chiaus</HI> alighted, and performed his devotions in prayer, then we travelled on, through great Woods, dangerous for Wolves and Thieves, by <HI>Chifflick,</HI> where there is a <HI>Caravansarah,</HI> but not always safe: so as we refreshed our selves in a large Farm-house, not far from thence, belonging to a rich Wine-Merchant of <HI>Belgrade.</HI> From hence we travelled by Night to the noted River <HI>Morava</HI> or <HI>Mos∣chius,</HI> the chief River of this Country; which arising above in the Mountains in two streams, the one named <HI>Morava di Bulgaria,</HI> the o∣ther <HI>Morava di Servia,</HI> after uniting, runs into the <HI>Danube,</HI> at <HI>Zen∣derin</HI> or <HI>Singidunum,</HI> opposite to the <HI>Rascian</HI> shoar: we passed this River at a place which was broad, somewhat deep, and rapid, and therefore not without some fear, and the continued loud prayer of the <HI>Chiaus</HI> in <HI>Turkish,</HI> and of the Couriers <HI>Ora pro nobis.</HI> This passage put

Not far from this River, was that great slaughter of the <HI>Turks</HI> by <HI>Hunniades;</HI> who, with ten thousand Horse, set upon the <HI>Turkish</HI> Camp by Moon-light, slew thirty thousand, and took four thousand Prisoners, victoriously re∣turning unto his Camp. Where he left <HI>Ʋladislaus</HI> and <HI>George Despot</HI> of <HI>Servia.</HI> We arrived at length at <HI>Halli Jahisar,</HI> or <HI>Crushovatz</HI> in <HI>Bulga∣rian;</HI> a considerable place, where there is an handsom Church, with two fair Towers. Then travelling the whole day through Hills and Woods, we came to <HI>Procupie,</HI> which some will have to be <HI>Villa Proco∣piana,</HI> in <HI>Turkish</HI> called <HI>Ʋrchup.</HI> Here we stayed till the next day, be∣ing lodged in a <HI>Ragusean</HI> Merchants house, where we were well enter∣tained. The Priest, being of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, spake <HI>Latine,</HI> which is a Language not ordinary in these parts; and enquiring of me after La∣tine Books, I presented him with one, called <HI>Manuductio ad coelum,</HI> which he kindly accepted, and gave me a wrought-coloured Handker∣chief, and some little things of those parts. They had also a Physician, who had some knowledge of Simples and ordinary Compositions. His manner was to go into the Market-place every morning, and invite all persons, who stood in need of his assistance, to resort unto him.</P>
<P>From hence we came to <HI>Lescoa,</HI> or <HI>Lescovia,</HI> where I could observe little, besides a large Tower, which seemed to be ancient, but without Inscription. We passed much of our time at a great Fair, which hap∣pened to be at that time kept in a large enclosed place, with great resort of People; where I thought it seasonable, to present the <HI>Chiaus</HI> with a Feather; he having lost his the day before, and we found some want thereof, for hereby we travelled with more Authority through all places. This Town is seated upon the remarkable River <HI>Lyperitza,</HI> which may well be called the <HI>Maeander</HI> of <HI>Maesia;</HI> for it runs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o winding and crankling between the Hills, that in the space of less than twelve hours, we passed it ninety times. This called to my mind the River <HI>Taro</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> which, parting from the Dominions of <HI>Parma,</HI> I passed forty times, before I came to <HI>Fornovo.</HI></P>
<P>The next day we travelled over the Mountain <HI>Clissura,</HI> one of the Spurs or Excursions of Mount <HI>Haemus.</HI> We were much surprised at the gallant appearance thereof, for the Rocks and Stones of this Moun∣tain shine like Silver, and by the light of Sun and Moon, (for I passed it once by day and another time by night) afforded a pleasant glittering show, as consisting of <HI>Muscovia</HI> glass, whereof I brought some home with me. This Mountain surely cannot be much unlike that mention∣ed by <HI>Olearius</HI> in his Travels into <HI>Persia,</HI> between <HI>Permeras</HI> and <HI>Sca∣machia,</HI> where he relates that he saw a Mountain of <HI>Lapis Specularis,</HI> which when the Sun shined upon it, looked like a heap of Diamonds. We descended in a narrow rocky way by the strong Castle of <HI>Kolombotz,</HI> or <HI>Golobotz,</HI> and came unto <HI>Ʋrania,</HI> seated at the bottom of the Moun∣tain <HI>Clissura,</HI> this is a strong Pass, which the Castle commands, and locks up the passage.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="20"/>
The Hills between <HI>Servia</HI> and <HI>Macedonia,</HI> are a part of Mount <HI>Hae∣mus;</HI> which, under several names, is thought to extend from the <HI>Adria∣tick</HI> to the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea; admitting of several passages, which <HI>Philip,</HI> King of <HI>Macedon</HI> took a special care to shut up against the Neighbour∣ing Nations. Which when he had done, he thought himself secure: and that from thence no Enemies could come at him, except they drop∣ped out of the Clouds. Some have thought, that from the middle Peaks of <HI>Haemus</HI> a man might see both the <HI>Euxine</HI> and <HI>Adriatick</HI> Seas; and King <HI>Philip</HI> made tryal of it: but we find not, that he satisfied his curiosity therein; nor do I think any hath done it. Being upon high Mountains, and more inclining to the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea, I viewed all about; but found, that the high <HI>Albanian</HI> Hills did cut off all long Prospect.</P>
<P>From <HI>Ʋrania</HI> we passed to <HI>Comonava,</HI> near which there is still a <HI>Greek</HI> Monastery, upon the side of the Hills. From thence to <HI>Kaplanlih</HI> or <HI>Tigres</HI> Town; but why so called, I could not learn. Then to <HI>Kupru∣lih</HI> or <HI>Bridge-Town,</HI> where there is a considerable River named <HI>Ps<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nia,</HI> and a good Bridge built over it. This Town was casually set on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire, while we were in it, and a great part of it burnt down; the fire encrea∣sing much before we got out of it. Here we met with many persons, who brought the Tribute, and a Present of Hawks out of <HI>Wallachia</HI> unto the Grand <HI>Seignior,</HI> then residing at <HI>Larissa.</HI></P>
<P>From hence, by <HI>Isbar,</HI> we came to <HI>Pyrlipe,</HI> first passing the high Mountains of <HI>Pyrlipe</HI> in <HI>Macedonia,</HI> which shine like Silver, as those of <HI>Clissura;</HI> and, beside <HI>Moscovia</HI> Glass, may contain good Minerals in their bowels. The Rocks of this Mountain are the most craggy that I have seen; and massy Stones lye upon stones, without any Earth about them, and upon a ridge of a Mountain, many Steeples high, stands the strong Castle of <HI>Marco Crollowitz,</HI> a man formerly famous in these Parts.</P>
<P>Then through a Plain Country we came to <HI>Monaster</HI> or <HI>Toli,</HI> a great Place, well peopled, and pleasantly Seated. Here the <HI>Sultana,</HI> who was great with Child at <HI>Larissa,</HI> was designed to be delivered▪ and lye in. All accommodations being ordered to that purpose, where I afterwards heard she was delivered of a Daughter, who lived not long after. The <HI>Turks,</HI> who have a high opinion of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, would have been glad to have had a Son of the Empire born in <HI>Macedonia.</HI></P>
<P>From hence to <HI>Filurina,</HI> and <HI>Eccisso Verbeni,</HI> where there are <HI>Aci∣dulae</HI> of good esteem, the Springs large, and plentiful. Before we de∣scended the Hill, which leads to this Town, we had a sight before us of the famous Mount <HI>Olympus,</HI> about Seventy miles off; and on the left hand we saw the Lakes of <HI>Petriski,</HI> and <HI>Ostrova;</HI> they have a Traditi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, that one of these Lakes was made, by taking great stones out of the side of the Hills, whereby the Subterraneous water, finding vent, over-flowed the Neighbour Plaines.</P>
<P>We came afterwards to <HI>Egribugia,</HI> where we again left the Plains, and travelled over high rocky Hills to <HI>Sariggio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</HI> Whence passing through the River <HI>Injecora,</HI> we came to <HI>Sarvitza,</HI> a noted Place, built partly upon an Hill, and partly in the Plain. The Christians live most in the upper part, the <HI>Turks</HI> in the lower: there is also a Castle upon a very high Rock: not far from hence we went through a passage, cut through the Rocks, like to a great Gate, and a small River passing also
<PB N="32" REF="21"/>
through it, which makes a fast Pass, and commands the passage of this Country, which put me in mind of <HI>la Chiusa,</HI> in the <HI>Julian Alpes,</HI> between <HI>Vensone</HI> and <HI>Ponteva;</HI> which passage the <HI>Venetians</HI> shut up every night, we took notice also in our Journey of the first <HI>Turkish Moschea,</HI> which was built in these parts, upon that place where the <HI>Turks</HI> first rested, after they had taken the strong Castle and Passage of <HI>Sarvitza.</HI> Here we also passed by a Hill of a fine red Earth, whereof they make Pots and Vessels, like those of <HI>Portugal</HI> Earth, which are of esteem all about these Parts. We proceeded over dangerous Rocks, in narrow hanging ways still on Horse-back; although we had little pleasure to look down the Precipices on one hand, and see the Carkas∣ses of Horses in some places, which had fallen down and broke their necks. Afterwards we had the Mount <HI>Olympus</HI> on our left hand, till we came to <HI>Alessone</HI> or <HI>Alesswn,</HI> a considerable place; where there is a <HI>Greek</HI> Monastery, and Monks of the Order of St. <HI>Basil.</HI> The Mo∣nastery was of a different kind of building from any I had then seen. From hence passing over a River, we entered into a round Plain, of about five Miles over; with divers Towns pleasantly seated in it. Then over an Hill again, which is a Spur of Mount <HI>Olympus;</HI> upon the top whereof an old Man stood beating of a Drum, to give notice unto Passengers on both sides, that those parts were free from Thieves. From this Hill as we descended, we had a good Prospect of the Plains<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pharibus.</NOTE> of <HI>Thessaly;</HI> and at the foot of it we turned to the left, and passed over a River, which runs from under a rocky Mountain, not in small Springs, but the whole body of the River together; and then through Vineyards, and Cotten Fields, to <HI>Tornovo,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Larissa,</HI> where the <HI>Ottoman Court</HI> resided: of which places we shall speak more hereafter.</P>
<P>In our return, we left the road, about <HI>Kaplanlih,</HI> and turned unto <HI>Skopia,</HI> a City of great Trade, and the largest in these parts. <HI>Scopia</HI> or <HI>Scupi</HI> of <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> named <HI>Ʋscopia</HI> by the <HI>Turks,</HI> is seated in the re∣motest parts of <HI>Maesia</HI> Superior, or the Confines of <HI>Macedonia,</HI> at the foot of Mount <HI>Orbelus,</HI> upon the River <HI>Vardar,</HI> or <HI>Axius,</HI> in a plea∣sant and plentiful Country, seated partly on Hills, and partly on Plains. It was first a Bishops, afterwards an Arch Bishops See; still a pleasant and populous place. There are seven hundred Tanners in it, and they Tann in great long Troughs of Stone, and make excellent Leather, wherewith they furnish other parts. There are some handsom Sepulchral Monuments, and many fair Houses, as that of the <HI>Cadih,</HI> and that belong∣ing to the <HI>Emir,</HI> or one of <HI>Mahomets</HI> Kindred, whose Father was of great esteem in these parts. In the Court-yard of the <HI>Emir</HI>'s House, stands a remarkable and peculiarly contrived Fountain, in manner of a Castle, set round with many Towers, out of the tops whereof the Water springs forth. Their best Houses are furnished with rich Car∣pets to tread upon: and the Roofs divided into Triangles, Quadrangles, and other Figures fairly gilded, and painted with several Colours, but without any Imagery or Representation, either of Animal or Vegeta∣ble. Here is also a fair <HI>Bezestan,</HI> covered with Lead; many Streets co∣vered over with Wood; and divers places are fair both within and without the Town, being set off by Trees and pleasant Hills and Dales.</P>
<P>There are a great number of <HI>Moschea</HI>'s or <HI>Turkish</HI> Churches. The
<PB N="33" REF="21"/>
fairest is on a Hill, and hath a large <HI>Portico</HI> before it, supported by four Marble Pillars; near which is a Tower of Wood with a Clock and a Bell in it; from whence I had a good Prospect of the City. There is also an Arch, which seems to be Ancient, and a rivolet running under it. A large Stone also which seems to be part of a Pillar, with this Inscription SHANC. A little way out of the City, there is a no∣ble <HI>Aqueduct</HI> of Stone, with about two hundred Arches, made from one Hill to another, over the lower ground or Valley between, which is a handsome Antiquity, and adds to the honour of this place. When <HI>Mahomet</HI> the First conquered this City, he placed a Colony of <HI>Asiaticks</HI> in it, which makes it the more <HI>Turkish.</HI> Great Actions have been performed hereabouts, in the time of the <HI>Romans,</HI> particularly by <HI>Re∣gillianus;</HI> as is testified by <HI>Trebellius Pollio,</HI> that he won so many Bat∣tles, and carried on such mighty things at <HI>Scupi,</HI> that he deserved a Triumph. Hereabouts also stood <HI>Paraecopolis,</HI> and <HI>Ʋlpianum.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Sanziack</HI> of this Place is under the <HI>Begle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>beg</HI> of <HI>Rumelia</HI> or <HI>Grae∣cia.</HI> A Trade is driven from hence to <HI>Belgrade,</HI> and to <HI>Thessalonica</HI> or <HI>Salonichi,</HI> and many other places. I have been more particular con∣cerning this City, because <HI>Geographers</HI> pass it over in a few words; and I could never meet with any, who had been at it.</P>
<P>From hence we travelled to <HI>Catshanich,</HI> a Fortress that commands the passage b tween the Hills; and afterwards advanced so far, as to enter the famous Plains of <HI>Cossova</HI> in <HI>Bulgaria;</HI> which some take to be <HI>Campus Merulae,</HI> a Plain not very much exceeding <HI>Lincoln Heath,</HI> yet the Stage of great Actions. Here the greatest Christian Army, that was ever brought into the Field in <HI>Europe,</HI> consisting of five hundred thou∣sand men, under <HI>Lazarus Despot</HI> of <HI>Servia,</HI> fought with the Forces of <HI>Amurah</HI> the first, and lost the day. In which Battle <HI>Lazarus</HI> was slain: and <HI>Amurah,</HI> viewing the dead bodies, was stabbed by <HI>Michael Cobilovitz,</HI> a Christian Souldier, left for dead in the Field. <HI>Amurah</HI> hath in these Plains a Memorial Monument unto this day; and that part is called the Field of the Sepulchre: in the same Plains was also fought that remarkable Battle between <HI>Hunniades</HI> and <HI>Mahomet,</HI> for three days together; where <HI>Hunniades,</HI> having very unequal Forces, was at last over-thrown.</P>
<P>We proceeded forward to <HI>Prestina,</HI> a good Town, and where we ex∣pected good accommodation; but having entered into a fair Room, we found a man lying down in it sick of the Plague. So we consulted our safety, and stayed not long; and having a <HI>Gypsie</HI> to our Guide, we travelled through a Country thinly inhabited, but fruitful and pleasant and were much refreshed with fair <HI>Cornelions,</HI> which grew plentifully in the ways: we passed also by an hot Bath, a little on the right hand. The Bath is an arched Room well built, and very refreshing unto Tra∣vellers. It hath a red Sediment, and is impregnated with a <HI>succus lapide∣scens,</HI> and makes a gray Stone. It is within two hours going of <HI>Bella∣cherqua</HI> or <HI>Cursumnè,</HI> where I observed a Convent and an old Church with two handsom Towers: From whence passing over the Hill <HI>Jasne∣batz,</HI> we came to <HI>Eshelleck</HI> between the two <HI>Morava</HI>'s, and so by a Castle upon a Hill, near unto which is a noted Convent, wherein is kept the body of <HI>Kenez Lazarus,</HI> and the body of St. <HI>Romanus,</HI> and so proceed∣ed. But I must not forget to say something of <HI>Larissa.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE DESCRIPTION OF LARISSA AND THESSALY.</HEAD>
<P><HI>LARISSA</HI> is the chief City of <HI>Thessaly,</HI> seated by the River <HI>Peneus,</HI> the chief River of that Country. Upon the North it hath the Famous Mountain <HI>Olympus,</HI> and on the South a Plain Country. It is now inhabited by <HI>Christians, Turks</HI> and <HI>Jews;</HI> hath fair <HI>Bezestens,</HI> divers <HI>Turkish Moschea's,</HI> and Christian Churches in it. It is pleasantly seated, and upon a rising ground: on the upper part whereof stands the Palace of the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> which he hath made use of during his residence in this place: it is contrived with jetting large Windows, on four sides, near which he took his re∣past, and pass-time, according as the Wind served, or afforded the best ventilation.</P>
<P>It is also an Arch-Bishop's See, having divers Suffragan Bishops under it. The Reverend Father <HI>Dionysius</HI> was then Arch-bishop. The Church of St. <HI>Achilleus</HI> is the Cathedral, where I heard Divine Service, the Arch-bishop being present, and standing in his Throne in his Episcopal habit, and his Crosier in his hand; when three or four of us Strangers came into the Church, he sent one to fume us with Incense and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>weet Odours.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> kept his Court in this place for some years, in or∣der to his Affairs in <HI>Candia,</HI> and for the great convenience of Hunting and Hawking, wherein he exceedingly delights. When I came away, it was said, that he would go to <HI>Negroponte;</HI> but he remained at <HI>La∣rissa</HI> some months after, until he removed to <HI>Saloni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hi,</HI> and afterwards to <HI>Adrianople.</HI></P>
<P>In the hot and dry Summer 1669. the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> passed above two months of that Season upon the Neighbouring Mount <HI>Olympus,</HI> partly that he might have a large Prospect over the Plains, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the <HI>Aegaean Sea,</HI> and partly to enjoy fresh Air, and be removed from the choaking heat of the Valleys; but this humour proved destructive to some hundreds of those, which attended him; for it became so cold

<PB REF="22"/>

<PB REF="23"/>
<PB N="35" REF="23"/>
upon the Hill, that many, who resorted unto him, being over-heated by ascending the Mountain, and then pierced by the cold Air above; fell sick, and dyed; and often in such places, where there was scarce Earth enough to bury them. The <HI>Sultan</HI> himself sell also into a distem∣per, but it lasted but three or four days: of Horses and Camels not a few perished. The <HI>Sultan,</HI> who is a desperate rider, killed one of his best Horses; by forcing him up a noted Peak of the Mountain, called <HI>Pythagon</HI> or <HI>Kissagon,</HI> where few or none could sollow him; he was also so daring, that he would have leaped on Horseback over a Fissure or Cleft in the Rocks in a bravery; and was scarce with-held from that bold attempt, by the prayers and importunity of his chi f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st sollowers: Many also perished by drinking of a Spring of a whitish colour upon the Hill, in their Heats and Thirst, contracted by ascending the Moun∣tain; they complaining of a coldness and heaviness at their Stomach for three or four days before they dyed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greeks</HI> (who are forward to magnifie the Concerns of their Country,) speak highly of Mount <HI>Olympus:</HI> and <HI>Homer</HI> would have it to be the habitation of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and the Gods, and to be without Clouds; but unto me some part of the <HI>Alpes</HI> seem much higher; and I have seen Clouds above it; and in <HI>September</HI> there appeared no Snow upon it, which the high Peaks in the <HI>Alpes, Pyrenaean</HI> and <HI>Carpathian</HI> Mountains, besides many others in <HI>Europe,</HI> are never without. And <HI>Olympus</HI> also was plentifully supplied with it upon the first Rain that fell in that Country; it not being unknown to you, I suppose, that when it rains upon the Valleys, at the same time it snows upon high Mountains; and this Hill I must confess to be visible at a great distance; for I be∣held it from <HI>Eccisso Verbeni</HI> in <HI>Macedonia,</HI> seventy miles from it; and it consists not of one rising Peak, as it is sometimes described, but is also extended a great way in length, and makes good the Epithere of <HI>Homer, Longum tremere fecit Olympum.</HI> If the word be there taken, nor<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>▪</NOTE> only for high, but long.</P>
<P>This Hill chiefly extending from East to West makes the Inhabitants, at the foot of the North and South sides, to have a different temper of Air, as if they lived in Climes much distant; which makes the expres∣sion of <HI>Lucan</HI> very Emphatical:
<Q><L>Nec metuens imi <HI>Borean</HI> habitator <HI>Olympi,</HI></L>
<L>Lucentem tot is ignorat noctibus Arcton:</L></Q>
<HI>Paulus Aemylius,</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Consul, winding about this Hill, by the Sea-side, overcame King <HI>Perseus,</HI> and so conquered <HI>Macedonia.</HI> When King <HI>Antiochus</HI> besieged <HI>Larissa, Appius Claudius</HI> raised the Siege, by<NOTE PLACE="marg">Livy.</NOTE> great fires, made upon part of <HI>Mount Olympus;</HI> the King apprehending thereby, that the whole force of the <HI>Romans</HI> were coming upon him. But the Exploit of the Consul <HI>Martius</HI> upon this Hill was most remark∣able, and unparallel'd by any since; who being sent against King <HI>Phi∣lip,</HI> the last of that Name, brought his Souldiers over <HI>Olympus,</HI> by pas∣sages<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 5.</NOTE> unknown, and such difficult ways, that his men were fain to wal∣low,<NOTE PLACE="marg">cap. 7.</NOTE> and make hard shift down; and his Elephants, by strange contri∣ved Engines, somewhat like draw-Bridges, one under another, were
<PB N="36" REF="24"/>
let down into the Plains; as Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh</HI> hath more largely described the same.</P>
<P>And as the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> hath honoured <HI>Larissa</HI> by a long aboad in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pdolybius.</NOTE> it; so King <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Macedon,</HI> the last of that Name, did the like: for we find he passed the Summer at <HI>Larissa,</HI> the same Year, when <HI>Han∣nibal</HI> took <HI>Saguntus</HI> in <HI>Spain.</HI> Whether <HI>Xerxes</HI> were here, when his great Army passed through <HI>Thessaly</HI> towards <HI>Thermopylae,</HI> Histories do not declare. But King <HI>Philip,</HI> Father unto <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, after he had quieted the <HI>Illyrians,</HI> and <HI>Pannonians,</HI> bent his mind upon <HI>Greece;</HI> in order whereto he took the City <HI>Larissa</HI> upon the River <HI>Peneus,</HI> and thereby got so good footing in <HI>Thessaly,</HI> that he made great use of the <HI>Thessalians,</HI> in the following Wars with <HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P>Before the Battle of <HI>Pharsabia,</HI> as <HI>Caesar</HI> delivers, <HI>Scipio</HI> lay with a Legion in this City; and this was the first place, unto which <HI>Pompey</HI> retired, after his Overthrow; according to that of <HI>Lucan.</HI>
<Q><L>Vidit prima tuae testis <HI>Larissa</HI> ruinae.</L>
<L>Nobile, nec victum fatis caput.</L></Q></P>
<P>And not staying there, he went along the River; and taking Boar, went out to Sea, and was taken in by great Ship, then ready to weigh Anchor.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Peneus,</HI> which runs by <HI>Larissa,</HI> is the chiefest in <HI>Thes∣saly,</HI> and into which most of the other Rivers run; arising from Mount <HI>Pindus;</HI> and running into the <HI>Sinus Thermaicus,</HI> or Gulf of <HI>Salonichi,</HI> passing by the famous Valley of <HI>Tempe,</HI> and running between Mount <HI>Olympus</HI> and <HI>Ossa,</HI> into the Sea.</P>
<P>In that famous Expedition against the <HI>Graecians, Xerxes</HI> would have made his entrance by this way: for <HI>Herodotus</HI> delivers, that he fail∣ed from <HI>Thermae,</HI> now <HI>Salonichi,</HI> unto the mouth of the River <HI>Peneus;</HI> to observe, if there were any passage, or any could be made, to enter into <HI>Thessaly;</HI> and finding, upon enquiry, that the River had no other passage, and that it could not be turned: he said, That the <HI>Thessa∣lians</HI> had done wisely to yield, and make their peace with him; for, by stopping of the River <HI>Peneus, Thessaly</HI> might have been drowned.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE> I found the Epithete of <HI>Homer</HI> very agreeable unto this River, for it hath a clear stream and bottom, and the Fable of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and <HI>Daphne,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Peneus,</HI> who was turned into a Bay-Tree, had a pro∣per Scene in this place: for on the Banks of the River, Bay-trees grow plentifully unto this day.</P>
<P>There is an handsome Stone Bridge over this River, consisting of Nine Arches; and peculiarly contrived with holes and passage in the solid parts between the Arches, to afford some passage unto the water, when it is high; and hinder the bearing down of the Bridge, in high wa∣ters, and great floods.</P>
<P>The City being full, many <HI>Turks</HI> had their Tents in the Fields, by the River side, and lower Grounds, which being of various colours, and not far from a large <HI>Moschea,</HI> and the City, afforded a pleasant Pro∣spect. The Sails of their Tents were so ordered, that they came not within a yard of the ground: so that the Air might freely enter into
<PB N="37" REF="24"/>
them; where they commonly remained passing a great part of the day in Drinking <HI>Sherbet</HI> and <HI>Coffee.</HI></P>
<P>The nearest considerable Port unto <HI>Larissa,</HI> is that of <HI>Vollo,</HI> or old <HI>Pagasa,</HI> in the <HI>Sinus Pagaficus,</HI> or <HI>Demetriacus,</HI> or Gulf of <HI>Armiro:</HI> not far from whence stood old <HI>Argos Pelasgicum;</HI> from which place the <HI>Argonauts</HI> first set sail, in that famous Voyage for <HI>Colchos,</HI> by which way the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> received intelligence from <HI>Candia,</HI> and his <HI>Asian</HI> and <HI>African</HI> Dominions. And not far from hence, at the Promontory <HI>Se∣ptas,</HI> there happened the greatest Shipwrack we read of; when <HI>Xerxes</HI> lost five hundred Sail by a Tempest from an East-wind.</P>
<P>It was no hard matter to have a sight of the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> at this place; for he rode out often, for his recreation of hunting and hawk∣ing, with great number of Attendants, and Huntsmen, and Falconers, in their proper habits: and also went frequently to the great <HI>Mosched.</HI> I had a full view of him, as he came out of his Palace, to go unto his devotion. Before he came out, divers brave Horses richly caparisoned, were mounted by divers of his Attendants, nobly attired, and rode about the Court-yard; so that he looking out of the window, made choice of which he liked best, and would then make use of.</P>
<P>At his first appearance abroad, great acclamations were made, low bowings from all, both near and at a distance; the Streets were made clean, and a <HI>Jan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ary</HI> was placed at every corner, to provide, that there might be no hinderance in the way. The <HI>Chiauses</HI> rode before, the Shatters, or great Courtiers, about Twenty four followed on foot; and immediately, on each side of his Horse, walked two chief <HI>Janizaries,</HI> with white Feathers, set in an hollow Pipe before their Caps, very large, and spread, and about a fathom high; which shaking as they walked, were high enough, both to shade and fan his face as he rode. Many brave Horses were led after him, and divers persons followed, car∣rying Cushions and Pillows to the <HI>Mofchea.</HI> Before he came our of his Palace, I observed many gallant Persons in the Porch, which the <HI>Chiaus,</HI> who walked with me, told me, were persons of the greatest quality in <HI>Turky.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> was then under Thirty years of age, well set, some∣what short necked, inclining to fatness, his complexion fallow naturally, and much heightned by frequent riding about in those hot Countrys. He hath a very strong body, and healthful, and is a hard rider; hath a stern look, and yet would speak kindly unto persons, and encourage the people abroad to approach him, taking no delight in the cryes, and frights, and flying away of the Inhabitains at the sight of him, or any of his Officers. The <HI>Grand Visier</HI> carried divers Christian Chyrurgeons with him to <HI>Candia,</HI> but I heard of no Physician of Note about the <HI>Grand Seignior.</HI> The <HI>Sultan</HI> took great liking to a private <HI>Turkish Priest,</HI> whom he met withal by chance in <HI>Thessaly,</HI> and made him his Chaplain; but the report was, that a famours Priest was coming to him.</P>
<P><HI>Achmet,</HI> the Prime <HI>Visier,</HI> being absent, the <HI>Chaymacham,</HI> of Deputy <HI>Visier,</HI> dispatched all Affairs of State here, and had the best House in the City. The Emperour's Refident had three Interpreters, who, upon all occasions, were made use of in Addresses unto him, and by whom we were informed of the most considerable Occurrencies; they being civil persons, and good Linguists.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="25"/>
The <HI>Sultana</HI> was also at <HI>Larissa</HI> much beloved by the <HI>Sultan,</HI> by birth a <HI>Candiot,</HI> little of stature, somewhat marked with the Small Pox; she was then with child, and was to go to lye-in at <HI>Monaster,</HI> a great and pleasant Town in <HI>Macedonia;</HI> which being a place we were to pass, proved a great convenience unto us; for, in order to her better Jour∣ney, the High-ways were plained, Hills made passable, with Broad∣ways and Bridges over Rivers, to the great labour of the Inhabitants; who notwithstanding were not unready, to make a Bridge for such great Ones to pass out of their Country; for at the first approach of the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> a great number of the <HI>Greeks</HI> forsook their habitations, for fear of him and his Attendants, and left them unto the <HI>Turks;</HI> but were re∣called again by his command.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Seignior</HI>'s Son was also with him there, about Six years old.</P>
<P>I went with <HI>Osman Chiaus</HI> to see the <HI>Chaymacham</HI>'s house, but especially to hear his Musick, which was accounted the best in <HI>Turky.</HI> Where I heard the loudest, yet not unpleasant Musick, I ever met with; ten men at once playing in an open high Room upon large Wind-Instruments, which they miss not to do at certain hours of the day.</P>
<P>In the Town I also heard some <HI>Turkish</HI> Songs, but especially concern∣ing <HI>Sabata Sevi,</HI> the famous <HI>Jewish</HI> Impostor, who had made a great noise in the World, and how <HI>Cussum Basha</HI> so handled him, that he was glad to turn <HI>Turk.</HI> This <HI>Cussum Basha,</HI> is a person much honoured by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and cryed up for his great Skill and Practice in Physick; an Art not much known amongst them. He is now <HI>Visier</HI> of <HI>Erzrum</HI> in <HI>Asia;</HI> is married to one of the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI>'s Sisters, and lives with her; and was formerly <HI>Visier</HI> of <HI>Buda,</HI> and upon that account well known to the <HI>Germans.</HI> Here I met also with a <HI>French</HI> Book, concern∣ing <HI>Michael Cigala,</HI> another Impostor, who had deceived the Em∣perour, and the King of <HI>France,</HI> and other Christian Princes. Which, the Interpreter to the Resident told me, the <HI>Turks</HI> very much laugh∣ed at; and that he was a <HI>Graecian</HI> born, and not a <HI>Wallachian.</HI> Of <HI>Paddre Ottomanno,</HI> who was thought to be the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI>'s Bro∣ther, now a <HI>Dominican</HI> Frier, and whom I had seen at <HI>Turino,</HI> I could hear nothing.</P>
<P>There were many Thousand Souldiers, and Horses, in and about the City, and Five thousand Camels for the Service of the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> which being of different magnitudes, ages, and the bunches on their backs of different shapes, and in some variety of colours, and treading soft, and with little noise, afforded me a pleasant sight, when they were led by my lodging to watering at the River.</P>
<P>When we read, that <HI>Mardonius,</HI> the <HI>Persian</HI> General of the great Ar∣my<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sir</HI> Walter Rawleigh.</NOTE> of <HI>Xerxes,</HI> wintered in <HI>Thessaly;</HI> It is no small Testimony of the fruitfulness of that Country; and though the number of men was here very great at this time, yet was there no want of provision, but all very cheap; in a Victualling house, I could Dine with roast and boy∣led, and Sherbet, for the value of Six pence, and at an easie rate could oblige <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Christians</HI> with a meal, which they would take very kindly.</P>
<P>The Place was also extraordinary populous: there being at that time such a mixed multitude in it. Yet was the City in very good order,
<PB N="39" REF="25"/>
and quietness. An Officer with a Club in his Hand, accompanied with about twenty Persons, walking about the Streets, and punishing all Persons drunk, quarelling, clamorous, or acting any thing against good Manners.</P>
<P>When I was there in <HI>September</HI> 1669. it was very hot Weather, and many were sick of Fevers and Agues; as they were at that time in most Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and at my return into <HI>England</HI> I found many languishing under Quartan Agues, who had been taken therewith a∣bout that time. They were then also in their Vintage, and we had the opportunity of tasting their Must and New Wine; and the stricter <HI>Turks,</HI> who would not be tempted with Wine, would be much deligh∣ted, to take a little in the Must.</P>
<P>During the hot sweating Season, we went often to the Barber, who would handsomely perform his Work, and much to our refreshment; trimming every Man according to the Fashion of his Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greeks</HI> have a place, of the bredth of a Dollar, lest bare upon the top of their Crowns; and then let the Hair grow round it the bredth of two Fingers, more or less; after which they shave all the rest of their Head, and wear it bare.</P>
<P>The <HI>Croatian,</HI> hath one side of his Head shorn, and the other side is neither shorn nor cut, but the Hair is let to grow as long as it will. The <HI>Hungarian</HI> shaves his whole Head, except his Fore-top. The <HI>Polander,</HI> wears his Hair short cut, so as it comes down to the middle of his Fore-head, and the middle of his Ear. The <HI>Turk</HI> shaves his whole Head, except a Lock upon his Crown. The <HI>Francks</HI> shave not their Heads, but wear their Hair long, as with us, only for the more amicable converse, and that nothing about them might be of∣fensive to those, whom they live amongst, they often tuck it up under their Caps. The <HI>Greek</HI> Priests, also neither shave nor cut their Hair, but wear it as long as it will grow; and many of them have thick heads of Hair; but those, that have least, receive most refreshment here. The Party to be shaved, sits low; and the Barber has the better advan∣tage, to shave much at one stroke, he lays on very much Soap, and holds his Rasor as a Knife, and in a few strokes finishes his Work. There is a Vessel of Water with a Cock hanging over their Heads, which the Barber opens as he pleases, and lets fall the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Water on them.</P>
<P>In one of these Barbers shops in the City of <HI>Larissa</HI> I saw an ancient large Tomb of stone of a <HI>Jaspis</HI> green colour, a noble Monument, but ta∣ken little notice of there, and the Barber had caused a hole to be digged through the top stone, and put Water into it, and made it to serve him for a Cistern.</P>
<P>I was in some doubt, how we should be accommodated for the ex∣change of our Ducats, Dollars, and other money we brought with us; but we found ready accommodation therein from Money∣changers, who sit in the Market-place for such purposes, to change them into Medines, Aspers, and five sols Pieces, whereof there was plenty in those Parts.</P>
<P>The great trading Streets were covered, as in other great <HI>Turkish</HI> Towns; the Shops are small, but well furnished; wherein hang all Commodities, which may be had in a larger manner, if desired. The Shop-keeper sits like a Taylor in his Shop, and so sells his Commodi∣ties
<PB N="40" REF="26"/>
unto his Chapman, who commonly stands in the Street. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or other Commodities, a man riding through the Streets cries them, and gives no∣tice where, and at what rate they may be had.</P>
<P>Though I have been much pleased at the sight of the fine Stables of Horses of many Princes in <HI>Christendom,</HI> as at that of the <HI>Louvre</HI> in <HI>Paris.</HI> The Vice-Roy's of <HI>Naples.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI>'s noble Stable at <HI>Dresden,</HI> and Count <HI>Wallesteyne</HI>'s at <HI>Prague</HI> in the last of which each Horse hath a Marble Pillar by him, eats his Provender out of a Manger of polished Marble upon a Pedestal of the same, placed in a <HI>Nicchio,</HI> in which hangs also his rack of hammered Steel, and over his head on one side his Picture as big as the life. Yet those gal∣lant Horses, I beheld at <HI>Larissa</HI> were surprizing unto me, chosen from all parts of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire; which were so richly equipped with Bridles and Saddles set with precious Stones, and withal so tender mouth∣ed and tractable, that it was a great delight to behold them. I saw some <HI>Tartarian</HI> Horses, which are of singular esteem, for hardiness, lasting, and swiftness, but unsightly, and promise little, and when <HI>Cha Gagi Aga,</HI> Ambassador from the <HI>Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary,</HI> presented some of them to the Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> at first sight I thought them but a pi∣tiful present.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greek</HI> Merchants some of them learn the <HI>Italian</HI> Tongue, in order to their Commerce: which makes that Language of good use unto a Traveller in these parts, where <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Latine</HI> are in a manner useless. The <HI>Jews</HI> speak commonly <HI>Spanish,</HI> as they do in <HI>Macedonia, Servia,</HI> and <HI>Bulgaria;</HI> and <HI>High-Dutch</HI> in <HI>Hun∣garia.</HI></P>
<P>I was in <HI>Thessaly</HI> at a very dry season, and some considerable Rivers were low, and small ones dry, yet one I observed about seven Miles on this side <HI>Tornovo,</HI> to flow plentifully from under a rocky Mountain; not in small springs or streams; but the whole body of the River came from under the Hill. The Country however in general was ve∣ry hot and dry, and I could not but think, what a different face it now had, from that, in the time of <HI>Deucalion,</HI> King of <HI>Thessaly;</HI> when that memorable deluge happened in this Country, which some affirm, to have lasted a whole Winter; occasioned by some stopping of the River <HI>Peneus,</HI> and its current into the Sea; into which River most of the others run, and so an inundation must follow in such a Country as <HI>Thessaly,</HI> which is plain, and encompassed with Hills. And some also conceive, that in the first times all this Country was under water, till an Earthquake divided the Mountains of <HI>Ossa</HI> and <HI>Olympus,</HI> and made a free passage for <HI>Peneus,</HI> to pass by <HI>Tempe</HI> into the Sea. In <HI>Macedo∣nia,</HI> between <HI>Comonava</HI> and <HI>Filurina,</HI> at a place called <HI>Eccisso Verbeni,</HI> where I saw plentiful Springs of Mineral waters, I had also a Prospect of two great Lakes; one whereof the People have a Tradition, that it first happened by taking great stones out of the side of a Mountain; whereupon there issued out such a flood of water, as to drown the Country about, and to cause a Lake.</P>
<P>As I travelled in <HI>Macedonia,</HI> the <HI>Chiaus</HI> told me, that within two days he would show me <HI>French</HI> men, whereby he meant the Country People of <HI>Thessaly,</HI> from some likeness of their Caps with small brims, to the little Hats lately in fashion.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="26"/>
The <HI>Thessalians</HI> have been a warlike Nation, and are still a stout Peo∣ple. I heard the <HI>Turks</HI> complain of them, as a sturdy and despe∣rate People; and Men, who, if injured, would find opportunity to be revenged: and that divers of the <HI>Turks</HI> had been surprized, and had lost their lives by them.</P>
<P>The Country of <HI>Thessaly</HI> seemed the more considerable to me, in re∣gard that it hath formerly been the Seat of great Actions, and produ∣ced many worthy Persons; and particularly, because the famous <HI>Hip∣pocrates,</HI> the Father of Physicians lived and practised here, as may be collected from the Oration of his Son <HI>Thessalus,</HI> and the Narration of his Life by <HI>Soranus,</HI> annexed to his Works; wherein it is delivered That he lived in <HI>Thessaly,</HI> and was warned by a Dream to abide in that Coun∣try. That the Princes and Rulers of the Barbarous Nations about <HI>Il∣lyria</HI> and <HI>Paeonia,</HI> sent hither to him; as also the King of <HI>Macedonia.</HI> That he dyed in, or about <HI>Larissa.</HI> That he was buried between <HI>La∣rissa</HI> and <HI>Gyrton,</HI> and it may be observed in the Epidemies or Books of <HI>Hippocrates:</HI> wherein he sets down the Particulars of the Diseases of his Patients, together with their Names and Places of Habitation. That a great number of his Patients were of the City of <HI>Larissa.</HI></P>
<P>Many famous Battles have been fought in the Plains of <HI>Thessaly;</HI> and a greater than any there might have been, if the <HI>Graecians</HI> had accep∣ted of the Challenge of <HI>Mardonius,</HI> the <HI>Persian</HI> General, when he sent unto them, to come out of their fast Places, and fight with them in <HI>Thessaly,</HI> where there were Plains and open Places enough, wherein to show their Valour.</P>
<P>The <HI>Thessalians</HI> are an handsom race of People, having black Hair, black Eyes, and their Faces of a fresh and florid sanguine, much like our fresh Complexions in <HI>England:</HI> so that Strangers much admired the Women, and spoke often of the <HI>bel sangue de' Greci,</HI> or fair blood of the <HI>Graecians.</HI> The <HI>Macedonians,</HI> who live in hilly Countries, are of a coarser Complexion: and the <HI>Moreans</HI> or <HI>Peloponnesians,</HI> who live more South-ward, incline unto a swarthiness.</P>
<P>They have always had the name of good Horse-men, and the Coun∣try still abounds in good Horses. They have also great <HI>Buffalo's,</HI> esteemed the largest in <HI>Greece,</HI> except those of <HI>Santa Maura</HI> in <HI>Epy∣rus.</HI> There are also large and well-coloured <HI>Tortoises,</HI> of a fine yel∣low and black; and esteemed very good meat. But the <HI>Turks</HI> laugh∣ed at the Christians, for feeding on such Food, where they might have Mutton, Pullets and Partridges.</P>
<P>The Country produces very large, fair, and delicious Figs, Water∣melons, the largest and most pleasant I have tasted; which were very refreshing unto us; as also fair and delicate Pomegranates, Orainges, Limons and Citrons, Vines, which are low, like those about <HI>Mont∣pellier,</HI> and not supported; but the Branches and Clusters great, and the Grapes as big as good Damasens, and of a delicious taste. The Wine of the Country is rich, but much thereof hath a resinous taste or tang of the <HI>Boracho.</HI></P>
<P>They plant Tabaco, and esteem it better, than what is brought from other Parts, as being more strong and pungent. The Fields are spread with <HI>Sesamum</HI> and <HI>Cotton Trees;</HI> but the Trees grow low, yet make a fair show. The Country abounds in Almonds and Olives; and the <HI>Greeks</HI> delight most in the ripe Olive pickled, as we in the green.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="27"/>
The Gourdes in the Hedges, with their large yellow Flowers, and the many sorts of green Thorns, and ever-green Oaks, make the ways pleasant.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ilex coccifera,</HI> and Chermes-berry, or the Excretion, serving for dying, and making the Confection of <HI>Alchermes</HI> grows plentifully in these Countries; and with this <HI>Aegeus</HI> in old Time tinged the Sails, which he presented to <HI>Theseus</HI> upon his Voyage to <HI>Crete;</HI> ordering him, if he overcame the <HI>Minotaure,</HI> and returned fortunately, to make use of these Sails beautifully coloured in token of Victory. Upon the high Hills grow <HI>Asclepias</HI> and <HI>Helleborus;</HI> in the stony Plains <HI>Carduas globosus, Cystus,</HI> Lavender, Marjoram, Rosemary, and other sweet smelling Plants. The <HI>Platanus</HI> or Plain-tree grows most sair, large and well spread in <HI>Macedonia,</HI> affording a refreshing shade; so that it is less to be wondred at, that <HI>Hippocrates</HI> found <HI>Democritus</HI> sitting un∣der a Plain-tree at <HI>Abdera</HI> in <HI>Macedonia.</HI> Some of the seeds and tusts I brought with me into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>They use much Garlick in most of their Dishes, and their Onions are extraordinary, as large as two or three fair ones with us, and of a far better taste; being sharp, quick, and pleasantly pungent, and without any offensive smell. Though I were no lover of Onions before, yet I found these exceeding pleasant and comfortable to the Stomach. They are used at most Collations, and eaten with B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead in good quantity. I asked a <HI>Chiaus,</HI> then with us, who had travelled through most of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Dominions, whether he had any where met with so good O∣nions, as these of <HI>Thessaly;</HI> who answered me, that the Onions of <HI>Aegypt</HI> were better, which was the first time I sensibly understood the expression in Scripture, and ceased to wonder, why the <HI>Israelites</HI> lingred after the Onions of that Country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Malainsana.</NOTE> They have a Fruit which they call <HI>Patlejan</HI> or <HI>Melanzan,</HI> between a Melon and a Cucumber; out of which they make a very pleasant Dish, by taking out the middle or seeds of it, and filling it up with the meat of Sawsages, and then pare it, and boyl it.</P>
<P>Of the Agents of foreign Countries, there attended on the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> the Resident of the Emperor of <HI>Germany;</HI> the Ambassador of <HI>Ragusi;</HI> and another of <HI>Wallachia,</HI> which are Ambassadors of the Con∣fines; the Ambassadors for Trade, residing about <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and not obliged to keep close unto the <HI>Sultan. Larissa</HI> being full and pe∣stered with People, the Emperor's Resident desired of the <HI>Sultan</HI> leave to abide in some Neighbour Town; who bade him to make choice of any Place, or any House he liked; which concession moved him to cast his Eye upon <HI>Tornovo,</HI> a large and pleasant City of <HI>Thessaly,</HI> about ten Miles West-ward from <HI>Larissa,</HI> and seated near the Hills; where most of the Inhabitants are Christians, there being only three <HI>Moschea's,</HI> but eighteen Churches of the <HI>Greeks;</HI> whereof the chiefst, which I observed, were these: the Cathedral Church of St. <HI>John,</HI> the Church of St. <HI>Demetrius,</HI> of <HI>Cosmus</HI> and <HI>Damianus,</HI> of the Nativity of the blessed Virgin; of St. <HI>Elias</HI> (this is the Habit of their Monks.) (where there is also an adjoyning Monastery, seated on the side of the Hill) of St. <HI>Anastasius,</HI> of the twelve Apostles, of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> (with a Con∣vent also,) and of St. <HI>Anthony</HI> the Hermite.

<P>And I could not but take notice how these Eastern Parts of <HI>Europe</HI> abounded with Christians of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church beyond my expectati∣on, and since they are thus to be found in many large Countries. In <HI>Graecia,</HI> and the <HI>Greek</HI> Islands, in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Parts of <HI>Dalmatia</HI> and <HI>Croatia,</HI> in <HI>Rascia, Bosnia, Servia, Thracia, Sagora, Bulgaria, Sirfia, Bessarabia, Cossackia, Podolia, Moldavia</HI> and <HI>Wallachia,</HI> and the vast Dominions of the Emperor of <HI>Russia,</HI> they must needs make a notable part of Christendom, and put me more sensibly in mind of an Expres∣sion of a learned Writer. <HI>If we should collect and put together all the</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Brerewood's <HI>enquiries.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Christian Regions in</HI> Europe, <HI>which are of the</HI> Greek <HI>Communion, and compare them with the Parts professing the</HI> Roman <HI>Religion in</HI> Europe, <HI>we should find the</HI> Greek <HI>far to exceed.</HI></P>
<P>In the Western Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> in many Churches the Fonts are stately, raised high from the Ground, and to be ascended unto by di∣vers Steps; sometimes covered with large Canopies, or with high Pa∣vilions handsomly carved and adorned. But in the <HI>Greek</HI> Churches
<PB N="44" REF="29"/>
the Font or Bason is generally made of plain Stone, and placed low upon the Floor of the Church; and this is more convenient for them, in their baptizing of Infants. For they put the Child into the Water, and are not contented with a meer sprinkling upon the Fore-head of it. But the Priest, after he hath blessed the Water, and dipped a Cruci∣six into it three times, he takes the naked Child by one Arm, and sets it into the Font up to the Wast, and with his other Hand laves the Water thrice over its Head; and this hath been their Way of bapti∣zing for many hundred Years. Nor could that otherwise have happen∣ed, which is reported of the Emperor, <HI>Constantine</HI> the sixth, <HI>Constanti∣nus sextus, dictus Copronymus, quod Infans dum baptizaretur aquam sa∣cram ventris solutione maculasset.</HI> The dipping of the naked Body in Water being apt to move it. I saw some of their Children baptized be∣fore the Navel string was fallen off.</P>
<P>The Fields about this Place are planted with <HI>Vines, Cotton</HI> and <HI>Se∣samum.</HI> The Emperors Resident <HI>Illustrissimo Signore di Casa nova,</HI> was well accommodated here with a fair House, and had thirty <HI>Turks</HI> and Christians in his Family, and two <HI>Janizaries</HI> attending at the Gate, good humored and fair conditioned Men, as could be wished. The Re∣sident was a <HI>Milanese</HI> by birth, a grave and sober Person, somewhat melancholy, much addicted to his Book and reading, but very civil and courteous. He dined and supped alone by himself; his Secreta∣ry, Interpreters, and others of his Family, had another Place of repast, and were always well provided, and served after the <HI>Turkish</HI> man∣ner.</P>
<P>The Ambassador also of <HI>Ragusa</HI> made choice of the same Town; and their followers often met each other, and many courteous salutes pas∣sed between them; but they were only by civil Messages, for they ne∣ver met, upon a <HI>punctilio,</HI> which kept them asunder; the <HI>Ragusa</HI> Ambassador pretending a right to take the first place, he being in the quality of an Ambassador, the other but of a Resident; although he were much despised for it by the <HI>Germans,</HI> and his Masters looked up∣on, but as Gentlemen of the <HI>Sette Bandiere,</HI> or Persons that were and had been Subjects and Tributaries under seven Masters, or Sove∣reign Princes.</P>
<P>I must not forget <HI>Demetrius,</HI> a <HI>Greek</HI> Merchant of <HI>Tornovo,</HI> in whom I thought I beheld the Humor of the old <HI>Greeks,</HI> we were divers times entertained at his House with much generosity, and hearty free∣dom. He desired us to enjoy his House freely, and to be merry after the Mode of our own Countries: and, as an especial favour, brought his two Daughters to bid us welcome: and we took the liberty, after the Custom of <HI>France, Holland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> to salute them; they were handsomly attired, after the manner of their Country; their Hair brayded and hanging down their back; their Shooes or Slip∣pers painted, their Nails coloured of a reddish colour with <HI>Cnà</HI> or <HI>Alcanna;</HI> the Leaves of which Plant, powdred and steeped in Water and Wine, and layed a Night upon their Nails, leaves this Tincture, and is much used in <HI>Turkey;</HI> where some delight also to colour tho Mains and Tails of their Horses. The <HI>Graecians</HI> of <HI>Scio</HI> also, who wear Gloves (it being a rare thing to see any here) do colour their Gloves also upon those Parts which cover their Nails. <HI>Cnà</HI> is a great Commodity in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Dominions, brought out of <HI>Arabia</HI> and

<HEAD>SOME OCCURRENCIES AND OBSERVATIONS IN THIS JOURNEY.</HEAD>
<P>IT is no unpleasant sight to behold a new Scene of the World, and unknown face of things, in Habits, Diet, Manners, Customs and Language. A Man seems to take leave of our World, when he hath passed a Days journey from <HI>Rab</HI> or <HI>Comorra:</HI> and, before he comes to <HI>Buda,</HI> seems to enter upon a new Stage of the World, quite different from that of these Western Countries: for he then bids adieu to Hair on the Head, Bands, Cuffs, Hats, Gloves, Beds, Beer: and en∣ters upon Habits, Manners and course of life; which with no great va∣riety, but under some conformity, extend unto <HI>China,</HI> and the utmost Parts of <HI>Asia.</HI></P>
<P>Though we were pretty well secured by Authority for safe Travel, yet we were not without fear of the <HI>Hussars,</HI> till we came to <HI>Esseck</HI> Bridge, over the River <HI>Dravus:</HI> for they are active Persons; and un∣derstanding the Language, will boldly range about for Booty, as far as that noted Pass; and, knowing all By-ways, will rob and spoil whom they meet, especially the <HI>Turkish</HI> Subjects.</P>
<P>Nor were we without fear also of <HI>Gypsies,</HI> who are stout and bold, and some of them have been noted Robbers. There are many of them in <HI>Hungaria, Servia, Bulgaria, Macedonia;</HI> and some I saw at <HI>Larissa,</HI> and other Parts of <HI>TheBaly.</HI> They are in most Towns, and live by la∣bour, and handy-craft Trades; many of them colour their Hands and Feet of a reddish colour, with <HI>Cnà,</HI> and think those Parts suffer less from the Cold thereby. Some <HI>Gypsy</HI> Women colour the ends of their Hair also. Though they be remotely dispersed, yet they are thought to have had their beginning about <HI>Wallachia,</HI> and the adjoining Parts, many of them are conceived to be Spies unto the <HI>Turk.</HI> A little be∣fore I came to <HI>Leopoldstadt,</HI> by <HI>Freistadt,</HI> a great drove of them appear∣ed in those Parts; which the People suspected to be Spies of the <HI>Visier</HI> of <HI>Buda,</HI> to take notice of the State of those Parts, and how that Fort proceeded.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="30"/>
Travelling from <HI>Belgrade</HI> into <HI>Servia,</HI> we were in some danger of being robbed: for we perceived three Horse-men to ride very fast af∣ter us; and, when they had over-taken us, they rode about us, wav∣ing their Lances, and discharged their Pistols; but the <HI>Chiaus</HI> perceiv∣ing them to be <HI>Spahies,</HI> showed his Feather, and said to me, discharge one of your Pistols at random, and let them know, we are not unarm∣ed; at which they went off, and we saw them no more.</P>
<P><HI>Caravansara's, Chan's,</HI> or Places of publick Lodging, built by Bene∣factors, we liked not so well as private Houses; and therefore, being but few in Company, seldom lodged in them, for they are wide Rooms, and we must provide for our selves therein; and sometimes they are dangerously seated, so that it was not fit to adventure our selves therein, for fear of being robbed; for though Robberies be severely punished, yet are they frequently committed; and <HI>Gypsies</HI> are well ver∣sed in that Trade; and therefore, in order to the safety of Travellers, Drummers are appointed in dangerous Passages; and in <HI>Macedonia,</HI> in a narrow Pass, I saw an old Man beating a Drum upon the ridge of a Hill; whereby we had notice, that the Passage was clear and free from Thieves.</P>
<P>We had the advantage of good Accommodation for Travel, for par∣ting from <HI>Comora,</HI> our Boat was towed by a <HI>Saick</HI> of twenty four Oars; <HI>Hungarians</HI> rowing upon one side, and <HI>Germans</HI> on the other; till we came to <HI>Motch,</HI> the Frontier Town, where we had a <HI>Turkish</HI> Convoy; who fastning our Boat to their <HI>Saick</HI> with eighteen Oars, rowed down the <HI>Danube,</HI> we carrying the Eagle on our Flag, and the <HI>Turks</HI> the double Sword and Half-moon, and passed by divers remark∣able Places to <HI>Buda,</HI> from whence we had good Accommodation for Travel to <HI>Belgrade,</HI> by open Chariots, with two, three or four Horses on breast; which with great speed conveyed us through that pleasant plain Country, and from thence through <HI>Servia,</HI> and other Provinces, we were furnished with very good Horses, which would travel at a good rate twenty Miles in a Stage, and were very sure of foot; where∣of I had good experience, when in some Parts we travelled over great Hills, unequal and craggy Places, and over the bare Rocks. They are very free, and therefore the Owners of the Horses took acceptions at our Spurs, which are seldom used by them, and the <HI>Turks</HI> had none, but what we brought, and gave them. They are very tractable and tender mouthed; and when we mounted or alighted, would hand∣somly apply themselves to such Places; and when we walked, some of them would follow us without leading. They have a lighter and les∣ser Shooe than our Horses; and when they have shod one foot, they take up the foot against it, and setting the other upon a Block of three inches high, they pare it.</P>
<P>They have very good Horses in most of these Countrys, and very fleet, but they never dock them, but their Tails grow out at length, and sometimes they handsomly make them up: and in their Journeys they often alight from them, and strongly pull at their Fore-top or forehead-lock, and think that doth much refresh them, which the Strangers who travel here call <HI>Croatian</HI> Provender.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bassa</HI> of <HI>Temeswar</HI> presented <HI>Ragotzi</HI> with a Horse, which <HI>Ra∣gotzi</HI> slighting cut off the Horse's Ears, Main and Tail, and sent him
<PB N="48" REF="31"/>
back again. This perhaps would have been thought an Ornament to an Horse in <HI>England:</HI> but the <HI>Bassa</HI> took it as such an affront to his, that he never ceased from stirring up the <HI>Sultan,</HI> and other Princes a∣gainst him, and never forgave the Injury, but by the help of the <HI>Turk, Tartar, Emperor, Poles</HI> and <HI>Ragotzi</HI>'s own Country-men also, he wrought at last his Ruine.</P>
<P>For their feeding, they make no high Mangers or Racks, to pull down thir Food; but, observing the Rule of Nature, lay their Hay low before them, and almost even with the Ground; which in long neck∣ed Animals, may be the most commodious way, they are lodged hard, and often with little covering. At <HI>Larissa,</HI> where the Town was pe∣stered with Horses and Camels: the Yards of the Houses were full of them, and Places made at the bottom of the Wall for their Food.</P>
<P>In <HI>Caravansara's</HI> the Horses are tyed to a ringle, fastned unto the side of a long Place, a little elevated, upon which the Travellers take their rest; and the Hay was laid a little below our feet, whereon the Horses feed.</P>
<P>They plow more with Oxen than Horses, and especially with <HI>Buf∣felo's;</HI> and have great variety of Ploughs and Carts; some whereof I could not but take notice of in <HI>Macedonia,</HI> made with Wheels, not consisting of Spoaks, but of solid Wood, in the whole piece; whether so contrived for strength, in those rocky Countries, where they must strike and force upon such inequalities, I cannot tell.</P>
<P>We were furnished with small things to oblige the People where we passed: and in Houses where we entred, many would welcome the Emperor's Courier, and ask him what he had brought for them. We pleased them with Scissors, Knives; and they would be content, if we gave a Glove to one, and the fellow to another. To the Women we gave small pieces of <HI>European</HI> Coines; and I was much thanked by a <HI>Bulgarian</HI> Woman, for a bright <HI>cinq sols</HI> piece, which she added to the dress of her Head, over her Fore-head, with other Coins she had there before; some of them wearing Duckets of Gold, and Pearl, and Stones of value upon that Part, which make no unhandsom show.</P>
<P>Being only careful to keep our selves from Thieves, we expected no such trouble, as we found from Wolves and Dogs, in our Journey about the Mountains in <HI>Servia;</HI> and especially in large Woods, we were continually alarmed by Wolves, especially in the Night; when they seldom ceased to howl in great numbers, and not far from us; so that we were forced to be solicitous in our Guard, and to keep close together. And as the Wolves were troublesome, so also the great number of Dogs in those Parts were very offensive to us. As soon as we came near any Town, or left it, they came out, running at us, barking and biting the Horses legs, and in Houses would be barking and snarling, so that without a Cudgel it was not safe going into the Yard. And it seems impossible, that these Towns should be surprized by the most silent Enemy, without having good notice thereof by Dogs: and sure, they are kept to this intent. For as soon as the Sun sets they begin to bark and cease not till the Morning. The Town of St. <HI>Malo's</HI> in <HI>France</HI> is also guarded somewhat after this manner, where they turn the Dogs out of the Town at Night, and are as secure there∣by,
<PB N="49" REF="31"/>
as if they had an army of Watchmen to guard them. Some such trouble from Dogs I remembred, that I had met with at the strong Town of <HI>Komara,</HI> when I came into the Town about Midnight, which was so full of Dogs fiercely barking and running upon us, that to save our selves, we were fain to take shelter in the <HI>Corps de guard,</HI> till a lodg∣ing was provided for us.</P>
<P>I could not but pity the poor Christians, seeing under what fear they lived in those Parts; when I observed them to make a way, as soon as they perceived us coming towards them. In <HI>Macedonia</HI> the Men and Women would betake themselves into the Woods to avoid us; and we took the pains sometimes to ride after them, to undeceive them of their folly and needless Frights.</P>
<P>But that which moved me most, was the pitiful Spectacle of Cap∣tives and Slaves, which are often met with in those Countries; toge∣ther with the variety of their hard Fates and Accounts, how they fell into that Condition; some by Treachery, some by Chance of War; others by Plagiary and Man-stealing <HI>Tartars,</HI> who plentifully furnish the <HI>Turkish</HI> Dominion; some fixed to one Master, others having been sold unto many, and at distant Places. But their Condition is most desperate who are Slaves to the Court, and belong to the <HI>Grand Sei∣ignior:</HI> for they are never to be redeemed. Of which kind I met with one at <HI>Egribugia</HI> in <HI>Macedonia,</HI> attending at the post-house; who though he had no hard Office, yet was extremely dejected upon this misfortune of Non-redemption.</P>
<P>In <HI>Thessaly</HI> also I met with one <HI>Sigismund,</HI> who had been a Slave to several Persons, and in several Countries. He was an <HI>Hungarian,</HI> born at <HI>Gran,</HI> and taken at the Battle of <HI>Barachan,</HI> under Count <HI>Forchatz,</HI> in the last Wars; first served a <HI>Turk,</HI> then sold to a <HI>Jew,</HI> who proved a hard Master, then to an <HI>Armenian;</HI> under whom he so well acquitted himself, that his Master gave him his freedom, and he made a shift to come to <HI>Larissa,</HI> where the Emperor's Resident entertained him. I was very much pleased with his Conversation, being a worthy, honest and good natured Man; and had maintained his Christianity in his several Fortunes. He spoke <HI>Hungarian, Sclavonian, Turkish, Armenian</HI> and <HI>La∣tin:</HI> shew'd me the Draughts of many Monasteries, Abbies, <HI>Moschea's,</HI> and considerable Buildings in <HI>Armenia, Persia</HI> and <HI>Turkey:</HI> and I hope by this time he is in his own Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks,</HI> who are well acquainted with the Captives of several Na∣tions, make observations of them: so they say, a <HI>Russian</HI> is best for the Oar, a <HI>Georgian</HI> makes a good Courtier, and an <HI>Albanian,</HI> a good Coun∣sellor. A <HI>Turk</HI> in our company, observing a <HI>Georgian</HI> Captive much dejected at his Condition, encouraged him, and bid him be of good cheer; telling him he might come to be a great Man, and one of the best in <HI>Turky.</HI></P>
<P>The first time I went to have a sight of the <HI>Grand Seignior, Osmund Chiaus</HI> made no great haste forward, and when I asked him the reason, he replied, I take no great pleasure to be too near him: and afterwards when he talked of some <HI>Bassa's,</HI> who had been strangled, and I added, that in this respect he lived more happily than any <HI>Bassa:</HI> he said, such things must be patiently put up, all our Lives are in the <HI>Sultan's</HI> hands: in your petty Kingdoms and States, Men are Tryed and Convi∣cted,
<PB N="50" REF="32"/>
but our great Empire cannot be so maintained, and if the <HI>Sultan</HI> should now send for my Head I must be content to lay it down pati∣ently, not asking wherefore: and I remember his Words were that in this Country we must have, <HI>patienza fin a perder la testa, e poi pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ien∣za,</HI> patience even to the loss of our Heads, and patience after that.</P>
<P>We had frequent Memento's of Mortality, by Graves and Sepul∣chres, as we passed; especially near <HI>Belgrade.</HI> For the <HI>Turks</HI> are com∣monly buried by the High-ways: yet their Tombs are not ordinarily splendid, consisting only of a Stone erected at the Head and at the Feet: yet some set up Stones of two, three or four yards high. Some have a Turbant carved upon the Stone, at the Head; and others set up two Pillars of Stone; some proceed farther, and raise the Sepulchres, as with us, and afterwards place two Pillars upon them, one at the Head, and another at the Feet. At <HI>Scopia</HI> I saw fair ones, after this manner, and two Sepulchres in one of them: but the best way I observed in these Parts, is by building a Pavillion sup∣ported by four Pillars. As we travelled to the South from <HI>Jagodna</HI> in <HI>Servia,</HI> I saw upon the side of a Hill, a large <HI>Turkish</HI> Tomb, about four yards long, and a square place covered by it, which the <HI>Chiaus</HI> told me was the Tomb of one of their Saints, and accordingly perform∣ed his Devotions at it, and at other Places: on Thursday Nights and Friday's, I observed the Women to visit the Sepulchres, and pay their Devotions at the Tombs of their dead Friends.</P>
<P>This Gigantick Saint that lay buried here, was certainly a fit Man in his time to wield the holy Club, with which the <HI>Turk</HI> does propo∣gate his Religion and Dominion, and if he were as long as his Tomb, he was as formidable a Person as any of the <HI>Patagonian</HI> Gyants painted upon the Southern Part of divers Maps of <HI>America</HI> with long Arrows in their Throats. I must confess it seems strange to me that the Sta∣ture of Man should be extended to that height. Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> an ingeni∣ous Person, who hath made very fair and accurate Maps of the <HI>Streights</HI> of <HI>Magellan,</HI> the Islands therein, and the Coast from the River of <HI>Plate</HI> to <HI>Baldivia,</HI> in the South-sea, told me that he had seen divers Graves in the Southern Parts of <HI>America</HI> near four yards long, which surpri∣zed him the more, because he had never seen any <HI>American</HI> that was two yards high, and therefore he opened one of these long Sepulchres from one end to the other, and found in it a Man and a Woman, so placed, that the Womans head lay at the Mans feet, and so might rea∣sonably require a Tomb of near that length.</P>
<P>But to return into the rode for our diversion, we sometimes met with <HI>Turkish</HI> Fairs, which are ordinarily kept in some large ground, enclosed and divided into Streets and Passes, according to the variety of Commodities to be sold, where a Man may recreate himself with multiplicity of Fripperies, and things different from those of our Parts, and cannot want variety of Musick; which, though but mean, proved some diversion unto us. The first Fair we met with, was at <HI>Lescoa</HI> or <HI>Lescovia,</HI> upon the River <HI>Liperizza</HI> in <HI>Servia.</HI></P>
<P>It was no small comfort to us, to find the Country so free from the Plague, which we only met with at <HI>Prestina,</HI> a large Town, on part of the Plains of <HI>Cossova,</HI> when we came into that Place, we were enter∣tained in a very good House, and brought into a large Room, well ac∣commodated
<PB N="51" REF="32"/>
with Carpets and other Ornaments; where we found a <HI>Turk</HI> lying sick of the Plague. The <HI>Chiaus,</HI> after the <HI>Turkish</HI> Humor, made nothing of it; but some others were not so contented; and there∣fore we removed and travelled in the Night, till we came to a <HI>Gyp∣sie's</HI> House amongst the Hills, where we were well accommoda∣ted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> were much pleased to see me write; when I came into a∣ny House, I pulled out my Paper-book to set down what I observed; which when they perceived, they would come about me, taking no∣tice of the Paper, and binding of the Book, wondring to see me write so fast, and with such a Pen, which was made of a Goose Quill, they usually writing with a hard Reed, cut like our Pens. Many carry about them an handsome brass Ink-horn, which they hang by their sides; their Ink is good, Paper smooth and polished; whereon they will write very fairly, as I have to show in the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Pass, which I brought home with me.</P>
<P>When I found occasion, I used to look upon some Maps, which I carried with me: whereat <HI>Osman Chiaus</HI> smiled, saying, there is no de∣pending upon Maps; they set down only great Towns, and often false∣ly. <HI>Chiauses</HI> are able to make the best Maps, who pass their Days in travelling Countries; and take notice of all Places▪ and know their <HI>Turkish</HI> Names; and in many particulars I found some truth in his Words; for the Maps of <HI>Hungary</HI> are not exact; those of <HI>Servia, Bul∣garia, Macedonia</HI> and <HI>Thessaly</HI> very imperfect. In upper <HI>Hungary,</HI> many Towns are omitted, many ill-placed; in the lower also not a few. The <HI>Danube</HI> seems to fetch about too much to the South-west, before the <HI>Tibiscus</HI> enters into it. In <HI>Servi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Hissargick</HI> is placed too far from the <HI>Danube,</HI> which runnes by it. I find no mention of <HI>Pro∣cupia</HI> or <HI>Ʋrchoop,</HI> of <HI>Lescoa</HI> or <HI>Lescovia,</HI> considerable Towns; the last upon the winding River <HI>Liperizza:</HI> nor of <HI>Kaplanly</HI> or <HI>Tigres</HI> Town, in <HI>Macedonia;</HI> nor of <HI>Kupruly</HI> or <HI>Bridge-Town;</HI> nor of <HI>Ʋrania, Pyrlipe, Comonava, Eccisso Verbeni;</HI> nor of the Lake <HI>Petriski</HI> and <HI>Ostreva,</HI> not far from it; nor of <HI>Egribugia, Sariggiole, Sarvizza;</HI> nor of the River <HI>Injecora</HI> near it; nor of <HI>Alesson,</HI> nor <HI>Tornova</HI> in <HI>Thessaly,</HI> a handsome considerable City. And he that travels in <HI>Macedonia,</HI> will never be a∣ble to reconcile the Positions of Rivers and Towns to their usual De∣scriptions in Maps, although not long ago there have been large ones published of <HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P>I took great pleasure to converse with <HI>Chiauses,</HI> especially if they were of any years; for they speak divers Languages, and have seen much of the World; are commonly good Company, and able to give account of many things. <HI>Osman Chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us,</HI> who travelled with us, was a∣bout fifty years of Age, spake <HI>Turkish, Sclavonian</HI> and <HI>Italian:</HI> a stout and faithful honest Person, very cleanly and neat: he told me he had travelled the greatest part of <HI>Turky,</HI> and growing old seated himself in <HI>Buda,</HI> as a <HI>Chiaus</HI> to the <HI>Visier;</HI> which place pleased him better than any in <HI>Turky:</HI> he took a civil farewel of me at <HI>Buda,</HI> bringing me out of the Gates, and with many a <HI>Dios</HI> wished me a happy return into my Country; and indeed, in all my Journey I met with fair carriage, and civil usage; when I came into any Room where the <HI>Turks</HI> were sitting▪ they would salute me, and touching my hand, require me to
<PB N="52" REF="33"/>
sit down with them, then offer me <HI>Coffee,</HI> and sometimes <HI>Tabaco,</HI> and at Meals invite me to eat heartily; only in some places, the Boys, and meaner sort of People would call me <HI>Sashtlu gaur,</HI> or haired Infidel. And a <HI>Jew</HI> at <HI>Larissa,</HI> whom I had employed to buy some little things for me; and I saying, they were too dear, gave me some ill Language, which so displeased some that were by, that if the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> had not been in person in the Town, they would have taught him other manners.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> took much Tabaco in the Countries which I passed, and many carried little bags thereof by their sides, which they take in pipes of an ell long, made of an hard reed, and an earthen head at the end, laying one end on the ground, and holding the other in their mouthes. I did seldom take any; but to comply with their kindness, I would not refuse it; and by reason of the length of the pipe, it was cool, and less disturbing; they take it also often in snuff. <HI>Seignior Gabriel,</HI> the Empe∣ror's Courier would tell them many stories; and while he was speaking, they would come about him, and listen very attentively: and he would pull out his snuff-box, and put snuff-powder into their noses, which they would take very kindly. They would be always gazing upon the Emperor's Armes cut in a Stone, which he wore upon his breast; whereupon he would take occasion to magnifie the Emperor, describe the multitude of Provinces subject unto him; and any thing that might confer unto his honour, whereof they would take great notice.</P>
<P>I liked well the neatness and cleanliness of the <HI>Turks,</HI> which we con∣versed with, and their washing of their feet, hands, and faces, though they had some purifying conceit thereof; while we travelled, the <HI>Chiaus,</HI> at the fight of a Spring, or clear water, would often alight, and wash himself; and every morning was very curious in winding up his Turbant, and combing of his beard; and would ask me, whe∣ther it were well done. When they go to the house of office, they carry a pitcher of water with them; they affect privacy when they make water; which they perform, resting upon one knee, and stretching out the other leg. Walking in <HI>Larissa</HI> with the <HI>Chiaus,</HI> the Streets being narrow, and full of people, and remembring the sad fate of <HI>Vincent le Blanc,</HI> who lost his liberty, besides other misfortunes, for pissing over a <HI>Turkish</HI> Saints head, who lay interred in a place, he little suspected; I asked him, where I might make water without of∣fence, who answered me grumblingly at first, but afterwards directed me to a place, and stood at a little distance, to secure me from any affront. And at another time while I travelled in an open <HI>Calesche</HI> or Chariot by Moon-light, I made water over one side thereof, to avoid being troublesome to the rest in ingaging them to stay for me till I alighted and went aside or retard their journey in the night; but one who layed down by my feet took notice of it to me with a great deal of regret, and and though out of the respect he professed to bear me, he was resolved not to divulge it. Yet he wondered I would venture the loss of my credit in such a matter.</P>
<P>Some experience we had in our return of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Justice, at <HI>E∣gribugia,</HI> in <HI>Macedonia;</HI> for travelling from <HI>Sariggiole</HI> over high Rocks, we met with a <HI>Turkish Aga</HI> before our arrival; who, having a nume∣rous train, had taken up all the Horses at <HI>Egribugia;</HI> so that we could not be readily supplied; and therefore intended to ride our Horses
<PB N="53" REF="33"/>
another Stage, the way laying now in the Plain, and our Horses strong and able, we set forward on the same▪Horses; but before we were got out of the Town, we were stopped, and carried before the <HI>Cadih,</HI> by the Post-master; who alledged against us, that we were injurious unto him, in that we passed by, without taking Horses at his House; he being allowed by the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> whose Servant he is, so much for every Horse he provides; and that none was to provide Horses in that place, but himself; so that he was damnified and had no profit coming unto him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cadih</HI> therefore considering of the business, and sitting cross∣legged upon his Carpet, and leaning his elbow upon four or five Folio Books, which he had by him; commanded his Servants to fill every one a dish of <HI>Coffee.</HI> The <HI>Chiaus,</HI> in our defence, urged, that we had business of concern; that we had the <HI>Chaymacham</HI>'s Letters; and were employed from the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> to the Emperor of <HI>Germany;</HI> that he himself was a <HI>Chiaus</HI> to the <HI>Vis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er</HI> of <HI>Buda,</HI> whither he was to conduct us, and that no man could or ought to stop him; whereupon the <HI>Ca∣dih</HI> said, the <HI>Chiaus</HI> must not be hindred in his journey, nor the Post-master be unconsidered; and so presently called for the Post-masters Book, and with his pen, made of a reed, set down a <HI>Sultanine</HI> to be al∣lowed him in his accounts to the <HI>Tefterdar,</HI> and bade us good morrow, and wished us a good journey.</P>
<P>In the <HI>European Turkish</HI> Dominions, which I passed, I could not but take notice of the great number of Christians; for, excepting great Ci∣ties, or where the <HI>Souldiery</HI> reside, they are generally all Christians; whereof the great body is of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, who live patiently un∣der the <HI>Turkish</HI> toleration. If there should happen any considerable commotion among the <HI>Turkish</HI> powers; it is highly probable, they would sit still, and be little active; and if any Forces of the <HI>Latine</HI> Church should attempt the Conquests of these parts, in all probability they would find very little assistance from them, and I fear they would rather adhere unto their <HI>Turkish</HI> Masters.</P>
<P>Though <HI>Augustus</HI> thought it a point of wisdom, to put some limit unto the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, yet I do not find the <HI>Turks</HI> are of his judg∣ment, but still endeavour to enlarge their Dominions, and when I consi∣der that people, their hardy education, sober course of life, and obe∣dience to their Superiors; that no <HI>Bassa</HI> can easily intend a revolt, but some others will discover him, in hope to obtain his place, or some great preferment; and that they so punctually observe the duty of their Charges; I am apt to think, or fear, if he, who puts bounds to the Sea, and saith hither thou shalt come and no further, doth not, out of his great mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, put a stop to their further incursions, they may pro∣bably obtain and conserve a far larger Empire, and even all <HI>Europe,</HI> un∣to the Western Ocean.</P>
<P>Certain it is that they are unsatisfied with their present bounds and look beyond <HI>Hungaria,</HI> and I have heard them say, we must in due time come to <HI>Beatch,</HI> for so they call <HI>Vienna,</HI> and try our fortunes again▪</P>
<P>At this day the Star and Half-moon are above the Cross, upon the Steeple of the Cathedral Church of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> in the Emperor of <HI>Ger∣many</HI> his Imperial City of <HI>Vienna:</HI> and it grieved me to see in all the Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ines a sort of Cross which our Heralds do not dream of, which is
<PB N="54" REF="34"/>
a Cross Lunated after this manner, whereby the Inhabitants as they te∣stifie their Christianity, so they acknowledge the <HI>Turkish</HI> power.</P>

<HEAD>A JOURNEY FROM KOMARA OR GOMORA▪ TO THE MINE-TOVVNS IN HUNGARY▪ AND FROM THENCE TO VIENNA.</HEAD>
<P>BEING at <HI>Komara,</HI> and having satisfied my curiosity as far that way as the Christian Dominions extended. I pursued my in∣tention of seeilng the Copper, Silver and Gold Mines in <HI>Hun∣gary;</HI> and being unwilling to return again to <HI>Presburg</HI> so far about to get into the road towards them; I attempted a nearer passage, although there be few who go that way. And therefore I travelled along the North shoar of the Island of <HI>Schut,</HI> till I came to the Con∣fluence of the River <HI>Waag</HI> and <HI>Danube,</HI> and then passed over to a For∣tification raised since the last War, called <HI>Gutta;</HI> it lies in a Marish ground between a branch of the <HI>Danube,</HI> the <HI>Waag,</HI> and the <HI>Swartz,</HI> within a mile of <HI>Newheusel;</HI> which we plainly saw from the Steeple of the Church at <HI>Gutta,</HI> and could distinguish the buildings within it; as the <HI>Bassa</HI>'s Pala<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e formerly belonging to the Arch Bishop of <HI>Presburg;</HI> The Church in the middle of the Town; the Tower to the <HI>Moske,</HI> and others. But this nearness to <HI>Newheusel</HI> proved not only dangerous, but destructive to it in the beginning of the year 1685. after that the <HI>Turks</HI> had sent great Recruits from <HI>Buda:</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the Count of <HI>Zabor</HI> having burnt the Suburbs of <HI>Newheusel</HI> and taken several Prisoners; the <HI>Turks</HI> to revenge it made an excursion, and burnt the Town of <HI>Gutta,</HI> and
<PB N="56" REF="36"/>
put all the Inhabitants to the Sword. Their Boats here are of one piece of wood, in which notwithstanding they venture themselves, and pass the greatest Rivers with them; in this Fort were 130 men commanded by Captain <HI>Matthias Fruhwurdt.</HI> From hence by <HI>Forchatz</HI> we came to <HI>Schella,</HI> where there is another Fort built to hinder the <HI>Turks</HI> from passing the River <HI>Waag,</HI> for hereabouts th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Tartars</HI> broke over, burned and ruined the whole Country about in the late war, in such manner, that it remains still desolate; at half a miles distance from this place is a hole in the Earth which burns like <HI>Solfaterra</HI> by <HI>Naples.</HI> From hence we went to <HI>Schinta</HI> a large Fort and built long since to command the River and the Country about. There is a Tower in the middle, four Bastions and many good pieces of Cannon. At the entrance there hanges a great Rib, a Thigh-bone and a Tooth, which I judged to be of an Elephant, having seen the <HI>Skeleton</HI> of one: and also such bones as these hang up before the Emperor's House at <HI>Laxambourg;</HI> those bearing the name of the bones of a great Heathen Virgin; and these of a Gyant. We came afterwards to <HI>Leopolstadt;</HI> a noble regular For∣tification with six Bastions, where the Young Count <HI>de Souches</HI> com∣manded, to whom I delivered Letters, and received many favours from him. Afterwards I passed the River and came to <HI>Freistat,</HI> a large sair Town but lately burned by the <HI>Turk.</HI> Count <HI>Forchatz</HI> hath a handsome Castle here, and a large House in the Town, whereof I took the draught.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lutherans</HI> had also a School or College here, but ruined with the rest of the Buildings. They are Tributaries to the <HI>Turk,</HI> paying yearly eight <HI>Hungarische,</HI> almost four pence of our money, for every head, whether of Man, Woman, Children, Sheep, Oxen, or Horses. The Children are educated to hardship, and the Women seldom marry twice. They bathe much, and use sweating naked in Stoves, holding their feet in warm water. They use Cupping-glasses also very much and scarifications. In the Convent of the <HI>Franciscans</HI> were onely twelve Friars left; and the <HI>Roman</HI> Christians in these parts have few other Priests but Monks.</P>
<P>Two <HI>Hungarian</HI> miles from <HI>Friestat</HI> lies <HI>Banca,</HI> where in a low ground near the River are fifteen Baths; into three of which the River∣water is now entred, the River <HI>Waag</HI> continually wearing out its banks by reason of its rapid course. Twenty years since there were also hot Baths on the other side of the River, but are now covered with the cold stream. These Baths leave a white sediment in all places, and tinge Copper and Silver immediately as black as Ink: Hard by these Baths is a Quarry of Stone, and some Veins of Chalk, which were ve∣ry pleasing to behold, the Chalk being of all colours except green, and the colours so finely mixed, as a painting or marble Paper doth not equal it.</P>
<P>We being here upon the 18 of <HI>March,</HI> and the weather very cold, had no thoughts of bathing in so open a place; though in some of them we saw Women and Children; and the <HI>Hussar</HI> who drove our Chariot hither, after we had supped, went out, and in a very hard frost pulled off his clothes in the open Meadow at midnight, and bathed him∣self in one of those Baths.</P>

<HI>March</HI> the 21. <HI>Graff Souches</HI> sent us <HI>German</HI> Musqueteers to convoy us through the Contribution Country, and defend us in our travels; we passed by <HI>Ripnich,</HI> and a Castle at <HI>Docatzi,</HI> belonging to Baron <HI>Berrini,</HI> and came at night to <HI>Topolchan</HI> upon the River <HI>Nitra,</HI> where the Town with the Church were burnt in the last war, and had not well recover∣ed it self again. A mile from hence at <HI>Bellitz</HI> are also hot Baths. The next day by <HI>Clesch,</HI> the Inhabitants of which place were all carried a∣way Captives in the last Wars; and through a great wood by <HI>Hoch∣wise,</HI> where the Inhabitants were most <HI>Germans.</HI> We came to <HI>Serno∣witz</HI> seated upon the River <HI>Gran,</HI> where is a Castle upon a Rock, but the Town is Tributary to the <HI>Turks,</HI> and they often visit it. <HI>March</HI> 23. We passed the River <HI>Gran</HI> early in the Morning, and came among the Hills to <HI>Hodrytz,</HI> by which Town runs a swift stream very servi∣ceable to them, which helps to move their Engines employed in the pounding, washing and melting of the Silver-ore. We travelled over a Mountain called <HI>Hell,</HI> and came to <HI>Schemnitz,</HI> the greatest of the Mine-towns in <HI>Hungary:</HI> and where great quantity of Silver-ore is eve∣ry day digged. The Town is well built, hath three fair Churches in it, the greatest part of the Inhabitants are Lutherans. There are also three Castles here; the old Castle in the Town, where there is Wind-Musick at six every morning, and at twelve, and at six at night. 2. The New-Castle, built by a Lady, who removed the Gibbet from this Hill, and left a fair building in lieu of it. The third is on a high peak, where there is a continual watch kept to discover the approach of the <HI>Turks,</HI> who immediately give notice of it by the shooting off a Culve∣rin. The Streets lie up and down Hill, the Country hereabouts being all very uneven.</P>
<P>There are very many Mines here, and many adventurers are induced to try their fortunes by the good success so many have had: for if they find a Vein of Ore in any reasonable time, before they have quite spent their Stocks in digging, they may probably expect great profit.</P>
<P>These Mines amongst others are very remarkable; the <HI>Windschacht-Mine,</HI> the <HI>Trinity,</HI> that of St. <HI>Benedict,</HI> St. <HI>John, Matthias,</HI> and one called the three <HI>Kings;</HI> but the chiefest and most wrought are those of <HI>Windschacht</HI> and <HI>Trinity. Trinity-Mine</HI>
is seventy fathoms deep, built and kept open with under-work at a great expence, much of this Mine being in an earthy soil. The Ore of it is much esteemed, and is commonly of a black colour covered with a white Earth or Clay; so that the streams where they work it, become milky and whitish, and is that substance I suppose which is called <HI>Lac Lunae,</HI> or the Milk of the Moon or Silver. Divers Veins in this Mine lie North, and other rich Veins run to the North-East. When two Veins cross one another they esteem it fortunate; so that all Veins of Ore keep not the same point even in the same Mine, which would be an help to discover them; but they have no certain way to know either which way they run, or where they are, till by industrious persevering in the labour of the Mines they are at last found out. They use not the <HI>Virgula divina,</HI> or forked Hazel-stick to direct them, having no opinion of it (as I observed they had at the Silver Mine at <HI>Friburg</HI> in <HI>Misnia,</HI> where I also learned the use thereof) but dig alwayes as the Adventurers desire. They shew'd me one place, which they had digged streight on six years, when the Ore was but two fathoms distant from the place where they first began:
<PB N="58" REF="38"/>
and in another place they digged twelve years outright, and a t last found a Vein which in a short time paid their charges. I was in many parts of this Mine, and went so far, that at length I passed quite under a Hill, and came out on the other side.</P>
<P>In <HI>Windschacht-Mine</HI> wherein I also descended as far as the water would then permit me, descending thrice almost perpendicularly about three hundred large steps or stairs of a Ladder. I observed a large Wheel deep in the Earth, of twelve yards Diameter; turned about by the fall of subterraneous Waters. This Wheel moves Engines which pump out the water from the bottom of the Mine, up to the cavity wherein this Wheel is placed. The water which moves this Wheel falls no lower into the Mine, but passes away through a <HI>Cumculus</HI> made on purpose, through which both this and the other water pump∣ed from the deepest parts of the Mine, do run out together at the foot of an Hill. Besides this Wheel there is another above ground which lies Horizontally, drawn about continually by twelve Horses, which serves also to pump out much of the water of this Mine; about all the Works whereof, I was informed that there were no less than two thou∣sand men employed.</P>
<P>In some places of the Mine it is very cold, and in others so hot, that to refresh my self I was constrained to go with my breast naked; al∣though I had only linen Cloths on. Where they work it is always hot, so that they labour naked for eight hours if they are able, and then rest eight hours more.</P>
<P>In this Mine they shewed me a place where five men and a Person of quality were destroyed by a Damp, for which reason they have now placed a Tube there, the like they place over all doors, and over all ways where they dig right on for a great space, and have no passage through; whereby the air is let in, let out, or carried round, and the Miners under-ground ventilated with it.</P>
<P>The blackish Ore is esteemed the best; much of it hath a mixture of a shining yellow substance or <HI>Marchasite,</HI> which if it be not in too great a quantity is not unwelcome, by reason that it disposes the Ore to fluidity, or renders it more easie to be melted; but if it be in too great a proportion, they are of opinion, that it preys upon the Silver in the Mine; and in the Furnace carries it away while it melts, by over-volatilizing it; and therefore they term it a Robber, as a substance which spoyls and takes away the richness of the Ore.</P>
<P>There is often found a red substance which grows to the Ore called <HI>Cinnabar</HI> of Silver, which being grinded with Oyl makes a Vermilion equal to, if not surpassing the <HI>Cinnabar</HI> made by sublimation.</P>
<P>There are also found in these Mines, <HI>Crystals, Amethysts,</HI> and <HI>Ame∣thystine</HI> mixtures in the clests of the Rocks, and sometimes nigh or joyned to the Ore; as also Vitriol naturally crystalliz'd in the Earth in divers of these Mines; and particularly in a Mine in <HI>Paradise Hill;</HI> which then belonged to Mr. <HI>Jacobus Schwiboda,</HI> an Apothecary, at whose House I lodged, and who presented me with many curious Mine∣rals.</P>
<P>And as there is great variety in the Silver-Ore, as to its mixtures with <HI>Earth, Stones, Marchasite, Cinnabar, Vitriol,</HI> &amp;c. So also in its richness; some holding a great proportion of Silver in respect of others. An hun∣dred pound weight of Ore sometimes yields but half an ounce or an
<PB N="59" REF="38"/>
of Silver; sometimes two ounces, three, four, five, and unto twenty ounces; what is richer is very rare, yet some hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een found to hold half Silver, and I have seen of it so rich, as to be cut with a knife.</P>
<P>A Specimen of each sort of Ore which they dig out of the Mines is carried upon its first being discovered to an Officer called the <HI>Probie∣rer,</HI> who is to prove and judge of its richness; which he doth in this manner. Of all sorts of Ores he takes the same quantity, the Ores being first dryed, burned, and pounded, he gives an equal proportion of lead to all, melts and purifies them, and then by exact Scales takes notice of the proportion between the Ore and Metal contained in it, and reports it to those employed in the great melting Furnaces; who accordingly add or diminish the quantities of those substances which are to be mixed with the Ores to melt them in the melting Furnace; as for example, to an hundred centen or ten thousand pound weight of Silver-Ore, which holds above two ounces and an half of Silver in an hundred pounds weight, they add forty centen of <HI>Leich,</HI> which is Ore pounded and washed; two hundred centen of Iron-Stone, which is not Iron-Ore, but a Stone found in those Hills, of which the liver colour∣ed is the best. A q antity of <HI>Kis,</HI> or a sort of <HI>Pyrites,</HI> according as the Ore is mixed with <HI>Marchasite,</HI> and of <HI>Slacken</HI> as much as they please. This last is the scum or cake taken off from the top of the Pan into which the Metals run, and is a substance made out of the former men∣tioned, by fusion.</P>
<P>Whatsoever is melted in the melting Furnace, is let out through an hole at the bottom thereof into the pan, which is placed in the Earth before it; and thus exposed, it immediately acquires an hard scum, dross, loaf or cake, which being continually taken away, the Metal remain∣ing becomes purer; to which is added lead which carrieth all the Sil∣ver down to the bottom with it, and after some time the melted Metal is taken out; then being again melted in the driving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urnace, the lead or what else remains mixt with the Silver is driven off by the blowing of two great bellows; and runs over from the melted Silver in form of <HI>Litharge.</HI> That which first comes over, is the white and that which comes last, being longer in the fire, is the red, not that it is Litharge of Gold, both being driven off from the same Metal.</P>
<P>Most of the <HI>Schemnitz</HI> Silver-Ore holds some Gold which they sepa∣rate by melting the Silver, then granulating it, and afterwards by dis∣solving it in <HI>Aqua fortis</HI> made out of a peculiar Vitriol prepared at <HI>Chremnitz,</HI> whereby the Gold is left at the bottom and is afterwards melted; the <HI>Aqua fortis</HI> is distilled from the Silver, and serves again for use. But it would be too tedious to describe all the works of these Mines which do well deserve as accurate Descriptions as those of <HI>Mis∣nia,</HI> and other parts, of which <HI>Agricola</HI> hath written largely, and very well in his Books <HI>De re Metallica &amp; de fossilibus. Lenys</HI> also of Mineral works is esteemed, and <HI>Lazarus Erker</HI> hath handsomely described the principal Ores and Mineral bodies. But certainly there are few places in the World to be compared with this, where Art and Nature strive to show their utmost force and riches.</P>
<P>They work in this Country much after the manner they did in the Emperour <HI>Rudolphus</HI> his time; who was a great undertaker and en∣courager of Mine-works; but, many of their Instruments and Engines are much improved.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="39"/>
Notwithstanding the great quantity of Silver made every week at <HI>Schemnitz</HI> and carried away in Carts, I found some difficulty to pro∣cure the least piece there, and scarce any one in the Town could fur∣nish me with any that was pure, for the Money of the Country is mix∣ed with above half Copper; and being desirous to see what alteration divers of those Mineral-waters in that Country, would make upon Metals, for want of other Silver, I was forced to make use of silver Crosses, Crucifixes and Medals, which I borrowed.</P>
<P>Near unto <HI>Schemnitz,</HI> where old <HI>Schemnitz</HI> stood, is an high Perpen∣dicular Rock, part of which from the bottom to the top is naturally tinctured with shining fair blue, some green, and spots of yellow in it. At first sight I was much surprized with the beauty of it, and could fan∣sy nothing like it, but a whole Rock of polished <HI>Lapis Lazuli:</HI> and I have heard from a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who lived long in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> that there is also a Rock like this nigh to the Silver Mines in <HI>Peru.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Glass-Hitten,</HI> an <HI>Hungarian</HI> mile, or about seven <HI>English</HI> miles from <HI>Schemnitz,</HI> there was formerly a rich Gold Mine, but it is lost, no man knowing where the entrance was since the time that <HI>Beihlem Gabor</HI> Prnice of <HI>Transylvania</HI> over-ran that Country, and the Inhabi∣tants fled away. The Owner notwithstanding left some marks and di∣rections whereby they might discover it, with the Figures of his In∣struments upon the Barks of Trees; which Instruments they have already found by digging in the Earth, and thus much is intimated to them, that where they find a Stone, on which a Face is carved, they are at it, and are onely to remove part of a Rock with which the Owner stopped up the Mine.</P>
<P>This place is much frequented by reason of its natural hot Baths, of which there are five very convenient, with handsome descents into them, and covered over with large high Roots. The Springs are ve∣ry clear, the Sediment is red and green, the wood and seats of the Baths under water are incrustated with a stony substance, and Silver is gil∣ded by being left in them: But the most remarkable of these Baths, is that which is called the sweating Bath, whose hot Springs drain through an Hill, and fall into a Bath built to receive them; at one end of which by ascending I went into a Cave which is made a noble Stove by the heat of these <HI>Thermae,</HI> and so ordered with Seats, that every one who sits in it, either by choosing an higher or a lower seat, may regulate his sweating, or enjoy what degree of heat he desires. This Cave, as also the sides of the Bath are covered by the continual dropping of those hot Springs, with a red, white, and green substance, very fair and pleasing to the eye.</P>
<P>Bathing my self in the largest of these Baths when there were a great many Men and Women in it; an active man to divert the Company, had privately conveyed himself to the top of the House which covered the Bath, and on a suddain cast himself down into the water, and by taking hold upon the bottom of the Seats kept himself under water for some time; afterwards a Serpent coming into the Bath through a channel which conveyed the water into it, many of the women were afrighted at it. He still to continue his service and good will to the Company, was the first that would encounter it, and deliver the Damsels; which he did in a short time, so successfully, that he caught the Serpent in both his hands, and holding it out of the water,
<PB N="61" REF="39"/>
put it into his mouth, and bit the head off. Being taken with his good humour, I afterwards sent for him into the Stove; and finding that he had been employed in the Mines, I asked him among other things, whether he had seen any natural Vitriol, and where, in the Mines, crystallized in lumps, pure and ready for use, which he said he had in many places, but in the greatest quantity, in a Mine now given over; by reason that in some places the Earth was fallen in, which was near to <HI>Schemnitz:</HI> And accordingly two or three days after he came to see me at <HI>Schemnitz,</HI> brought me Lamps and Mine-mens habits for my self, and two Friends more; and we went with him under ground, till I came where he shew'd me great quantities of it, much to my satis∣faction: the Vitriol there shooting upon the Stones and Earth, upon the floor and sides of the passages, as it doth by art in the Pans, and about the sticks, not hanging from the top, as in many other places I have seen it, like to Ice-icles.</P>
<P><HI>Glass-Hitten</HI> belonges to the Count of <HI>Lippey,</HI> of whose Family was the Learned <HI>Polycarpus Procopius Bocanus,</HI> who was sent some time past by the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Presburg</HI> to give an account of the rarities of these Countries; but his death hindred the publishing of his observa∣tions.</P>
<P><HI>Eisenbach</HI> about four <HI>English</HI> miles from <HI>Glass-Hitten,</HI> and five or six from <HI>Schemnitz,</HI> hath also hot Baths; the Sediment of which is red, and turnes into stone; so that I brought away with me pieces of it of five or six inches diameter: I took also a large piece of this water petre∣fied as it fell from a spout in which the waves of it are to be seen; but the spout it self, although made of Wood, was not at all changed, as ly∣ing under it. However, those Trees with which they built the sides of the Bath were so petrefied, that those which lay next above the water, were intirely turned into Stone. And it was not unpleasant to ob∣serve how nature did here assist art, and out of the body of a Firr-Tree frame a Column of Stone. Nor is it much to be wondred at, that the wood under the water should remain unaltered whilst that above suffer∣ed so great a change. These waters are hot, and part of whatsoever is contained in them is sufficiently Volatilized to be carried up with the steam of the Bath, and I remember in the Bath of the Green Pillars at <HI>Buda,</HI> I took notice, that the exhalation from the Bath reverbera∣ted by the high <HI>Cupola</HI> built over it, and by the Irons extended from one Column to another, and by the Capitals of the Pillars was for∣med into long Stones like <HI>Ice-icles,</HI> which hang to all the said places, such as may be observed in many subterraneous <HI>Grotto</HI>'s, and particu∣larly in <HI>England</HI> in <HI>Okey-hole</HI> in <HI>Somerset-shire,</HI> and <HI>Pooles-hole</HI> in <HI>Dar∣by-shire. Sulphur</HI> also which is in great quantity in many hot Springs flyeth away continually, and is not to be found in them, if you boyl or evaporate the Bath water: and therefore to discover it, I thought it more rational to look out of the water than into it; neither was I more deceived in my conjecture, than he who looked towards the West, rather than towards the East to see the rising of the Sun. For upon many places which were over the Baths, and received the steams of the hot water, I have seen <HI>Sulphur</HI> to stick; and to satisfie my curiosity further herein, I caused once a Pipe to be opened at <HI>Baden</HI> in <HI>Austria,</HI> through which the hot water continually ran, and took with my hand from the upper part of the Pipe, divers Boxes full of a substance
<PB N="62" REF="40"/>
scarce to be distinguished from Flower of Brimstone. Walking about also one day in the <HI>Sower Bath</HI> at <HI>Baden,</HI> and leaning over the Balli∣stres to talk with some Friends, who were then bathing themselves, I perceived that my Buttons and what else I wore of silver, were all turned yellow of a fair Gold colour, although I were at some distance from the water. Which made me try this experiment also, which was to hang money over the Bath at a foot distance, or at a greater, to see what alteration it would make, and how soon; which it co∣loured in a minutes time, and that which was nearer in half a mi∣nute.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Eisenbach,</HI> there are two convenient Baths much fre∣quented, and a third which is made by the water let out of the former, called the <HI>Snakes-bath,</HI> from the number of Snakes coming into, and delighting in it when it is filled with these warm waters.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> the thirtieth, I travelled from <HI>Schemnitz</HI> by <HI>Glass-Hitten,</HI> and <HI>Apfelsdorff,</HI> where there is a House of the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Pres∣burg;</HI> and afterwards passed the River <HI>Gran</HI> and came in between the Hills; where in one place they have thrown up the Earth, and made a work from one ridge of the Hills to the other, to defend the Country; and hinder the <HI>Turkish</HI> Excursions towards <HI>Chremnitz:</HI> Afterwards we proceeded by that Golden River and yellow Stream which washes all the Ore above till we came to the Town.</P>
<P><HI>Chremnitz</HI> is a small Town, but hath large Suburbs, and lies high▪ St. <HI>Johns</HI> Church at some distance from it, is thought to stand upon the highest ground in <HI>Hungary.</HI> This is the oldest Mine-Town, and the richest in Gold of all the seven in these parts, which are these, <HI>Schemnitz, Chremnitz, Newsol, Koningsberg, Bochantz, Libeten</HI> and <HI>Tiln.</HI></P>
<P>They have worked in the Gold-Mine at <HI>Chremnitz</HI> nine hundred and fifty years; the Mine is about nine or ten <HI>English</HI> miles in length, and there is one <HI>Cuniculus</HI> or Horizontal passage which is eight hun∣dred fathoms long, called the <HI>Erbstall.</HI> The depth of it is above one hundred and seventy fathoms; they do not use Ladders to descend into this Mine, but are let down at the end of a Cable, unto which is fastned a sling, or seat of Leather; the Leather being broad, and divided ordinarily into two or three parts, so that it is to be shifted or changed as you find convenience, and affords no uneasie seat, even to such as are not used to it. And in this manner, whoseever enters the Mine is let down. Through one of the <HI>Scha∣chts</HI> or perpendicular Pits, of which there are six. 1. That of <HI>Rodol∣phus.</HI> 2. Queen <HI>Anne.</HI> 3. <HI>Ferdinand.</HI> 4. <HI>Matthias.</HI> 5. <HI>Windschacht,</HI> and 6. <HI>Leopold.</HI> I went down by the Pit of the Emperour <HI>Rodolphus,</HI> gently descending by the turning about of a large wheel to which the Cable is fastned, one hundred and eight fathoms deep into the Earth; and after many hours being in the Mine, was drawn out again by <HI>Leopoldi Schacht,</HI> or <HI>Leopolds</HI> Pit, or Shaft, streight up above one hundred and fifty fathoms; a heigh surpassing that of the Pyramids by a third part. At the bottom of which <HI>Schacht</HI> I was not discouraged to find my self so deep in the earth, for considering that I was yet above three thousand miles from the Center, I thought my self but in a Well. It is built on all sides with Firr-Trees, one laying upon another on four sides from the bottom to the top, and after the same man∣ner
<PB N="63" REF="40"/>
all these Mines are kept open where they have not a Rock on all sides.</P>
<P>Many Veins of the Ore run to the North, and to the East; They work also towards one, two, or three of the clock, as they speak; for the Miners direct themselves under-ground by a Compass not of thirty two points (such as is used at Sea) but by one of twenty four, which they divide as we do the hours of the day into twice twelve. Of the Gold-Ore some is white, some black, some of it red, and some yellow. That with black spots in white is esteemed the best, as also the Ore which lieth next to the black Veins. This Ore is not rich enough to suffer any proof in small parcels, like that of other Mines, whereby to know what proportion of Metal is contain'd in it▪ but they pound a ve∣ry great quantity thereof, and wash it in a little River which runs near the Town: The whole River being divided and admitted into di∣vers cuts, runs over the Ore continually, and so washes away the earthy parts from the <HI>Metallin,</HI> and from a clear River above the Town, by its running through so many works, and over so much pounded Ore, it becomes below the Town a dark yellow Stream, of the colour of the Earth of those Hills. Unless it be upon six days of the year; two at <HI>Christmas,</HI> two at <HI>Easter,</HI> and two at <HI>Whitsuntide,</HI> when the River it self as well as the Mine-men ceaseth from working, and is permitted to flow clear within its own Banks.</P>
<P>There have been pieces of pure or virgin Gold found in this Mine, some of which I have seen in the Emperour's Treasury, and in the Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI>'s Repository, one piece as broad as the palm of my hand, and others less; and upon a white Stone many pieces of pure Gold; but these are very rare.</P>
<P>The common yellow Earth of the Country near <HI>Chremnitz,</HI> especi∣ally of the Hills towards the West, although it be not esteemed Ore, affords some Gold. And in one place I saw a great part of an Hill digg'd away, which hath been cast into the works, washed and wrought in the same manner, as pounded Ore with considerable pro∣fit.</P>
<P><HI>Matthias Dollinger</HI> the chief Officer at <HI>Chremnitz</HI> for the Mine-work, hath also lately invented a Mill to pound the Ore finer than it was before; and by this invention hath obtained a considerable quantity of Gold out of that Ore which otherwise would have yielded none; in his House I saw many sorts of Minerals, and was very kindly en∣tertained by him; and when I was at the bottom of the Gold-Mine he sent me down a present of excellent Wine to drink the Emperour's health.</P>
<P>Some passages in this Mine cut through the Rock and long disused, have grown up again; and I observed the sides of some which had been formerly wide enough to carry their Ore through, to approach each other; so as we passed with difficulty; this happens most in moist places, the passages unite not from the top to the bottom, but from one side to another.</P>
<P>They carry their Ore under ground from one place to another; or to the bottom of the Pit whence it is drawn out, in a Box or Chest which they call a Hundt or Dog; this runs upon four whels, it is high∣er behind than before, and hath a tongue of Iron at the bottom, which being fitted into a channel of wood framed in the middle of
<PB N="64" REF="41"/>
the bottom of each passage, it can no ways deviate, but keeps alwayes in the middle; and by this means a little Boy will run full speed with three or four hundred pound weight of Ore or Earth before him, wherever you command him, without any light, through those dis∣mal dark passages of the Mine: and it was very new to me to hear the rattling they make in the Mine, and the alteration of the sound as they are nearer or further from us; and to see them come with that swiftness out of the Rocks, overturn their little Charriot, where they are to leave their Ore, then turn again and enter those dark Caves with such a force and swiftness.</P>
<P>Not much unlike this is another instrument they have to bring the Ore from the mouth of the Mine, or from the Hills down to the <HI>Buchworke,</HI> where they pound it and wash it; but instead of a tongue it hath eight wheels or four rowlers and four wheels, and the way is made with Firr in such manner and at such a distance that the row∣lers rowl upon the wood of the Firr-trees. And these rowlers and wheels are so contrived, that these Chests can never overturn nor go out of the way, and a child draws them, and sometimes a dog serves the turn. To one <HI>Buchworke</HI> alone, they carry every week three or four hundred of these Chests full, and each Chest holds four hundred pound weight.</P>
<P>There were two very bad strong damps in this Mine when I was there, and divers others that had not the like force to suffocate in so small a time. One of these Damps was in a <HI>Schacht Puteus</HI> or Pit, and the other in a Stall, or right-on passage; no Lamps would burn in either of them, yet the Miners would venture into them for some short space of time: and we let one man down into that Damp which was in the Pit five or six times; but pulled him up again as soon as ever we saw his Lamp go out; this place is most poysonous when the water is high, the vapour then arising more strongly, the other Damp in the <HI>Cuniculus</HI> they hope to remedy, by perflation, and making or digging another passage into it.</P>
<P>I was informed that there had been twenty eight men killed at one time, by Damps in four <HI>Cuniculi,</HI> seven in each; and in the sinking of <HI>Leopold</HI>'s Pit, they were much troubled with Damps, which they remedied in this manner.</P>
<P>They fixed to the side of the <HI>Schacht</HI> or Pit a Tube from the top to the bottom; and that not proving sufficient they forced down a broad flat board which covered or stopped the Pit, or couched very near the sides of it on all sides, but where the Tube was: and so forced out all the Air in the Pit through the Tube; which work they were forced often to repeat. And now they having divers other passages into it, the Air is good and sufficient, and I was drawn up through it without the least trouble in breathing.</P>
<P><HI>Altermans</HI> Fore-stall, a <HI>Cuniculus</HI> five hundred fathoms long, was burned in the year 1642. by the carelesness of a boy wiping the snuff of a Lamp upon the wood; and fifty men smothered in it; they were all taken out except one, who was afterwards found to be dissolved by the sharp waters of the Mine, nothing escaping either of flesh or bones, but only some of his cloths.</P>
<P>There is Vitriol in this Mine, white, red, blue and green; and also Vitriolat waters. There is a substance found, which sticks to the
<PB N="65" REF="41"/>
Gold-Ore of small pointed parts like needles, of a purple colour, and shining, the mother of which is yellow like brimstone, it is called by them Antimony of Gold. There are Crystals found here, and some tinctured yellow.</P>
<P>There is a Vitriol-Mine in these Hills nigh the Gold-Mine, about eighty fathoms deep. The Earth or Ore whereof is reddish, and sometimes greenish. This Earth is infused in water, and after three days the water is poured off, and boyled seven days in a leaden Vessel, till it comes to a thick granulated whitish substance, which is after∣wards reduced to a Calx-in an Oven, and serves in the making of <HI>Aqua fortis,</HI> or the separating water used at <HI>Schemnitz.</HI></P>
<P>Where they pound the Gold-Ore, they lay a foundation three yards deep of wood, upon which they place the Ore, over which there are four and twenty Beams armed at the bottom with Iron, which break and grind the Ore, it being covered all the while with water. These Beams are moved by four Wheels, one Wheel to six Beams, the water which comes out from the pounded Ore, is let into little Pits or Chests commonly seven or eight one after another; and afterwards into a large Pit of almost half an Aker of ground, and then after set∣ling let out.</P>
<P>The Gold-Ore in powder or pounded is called <HI>Slich,</HI> of which that is the richest which is nearest to the Beams where it is first pounded. They work thus day and night continually. The Candles which they make use of are of Firr or some Resinous wood.</P>
<P>They take the <HI>Slich</HI> washed so long as perhaps in an hundred pound weight, there may be half an ounce or an ounce of Gold and Silver, the greatest part ordinarily Gold, two thirds generally, (for the <HI>Chrem∣nitz</HI> Gold-Ore is seldom without some mixture of Silver, and the best of the <HI>Schemnitz</HI> Silver-Ore yields an eighth part of Gold in pro∣portion to the Silver;) to this <HI>Slich</HI> they add Limestone and Slacken, and melt them together in the melting Furnace.</P>
<P>This first melting produces a substance called <HI>Lech;</HI> this <HI>Lech</HI> they burn with Charcoal to make it lighter, to open its body and render it porous, and then it is called <HI>Rost.</HI></P>
<P>To the <HI>Rost</HI> they add Sand as they see occasion, and melt it again in the melting Furnace; then let it out into the Pan, and proceed as in the melting of Silver.</P>
<P>They have divers other ways to get the Gold out of the pounded Ore, and I cannot omit to set down this one, in which they proceed without Lead.</P>
<P>They wash the pounded Ore often, and lay it in powder upon Cloths, and by the gentle oblique descending of the water over it, and their continual stirring it, the earthy, clayish, and lighter parts are washt away, while the heavier and metalline remain in the Cloth: not much unlike to this proceeding is that with Sheep-skins and Wooll, which they place either in the water which comes from the works, or in rivulets which have their Heads hid in Hills and Mountains rich in Gold; so that while the water and fluid parts pass through or over them, the more solid, heavy and metalline are insnared; and by this way some have obtained the Golden Fleece. But to continue the man∣ner of working with cloths, they wash the cloths in which the Ore doth stick in several Tubs, and the water after some setling is pour'd
<PB N="66" REF="42"/>
off from its Sediment; which Sediment is again washt and stirr'd up in several Vessels and Troughs, till at length they sprinkle Quick sil∣ver upon it, and knead it well together for an hour or two; and then washing it again in a wooden Vessel, after the separating of much of it, which the Quick-silver touches not, by striking this Vessel against their leg, they bring the Gold and Quick-silver together in an <HI>Amal∣gama,</HI> to one corner of it. From this <HI>Amalgama</HI> they strain as much of the Quick-silver as they can through course cloths first, and then through fine. They put the Mass remaining upon a perforated Plate, which they set over a deep Pan placed in the Earth; in the bottom of which Pan they also put Quick-silver: This Pan they cover, and lute the cover well, and then make a Charcoal fire, upon it, and drive down the Quick-silver yet remaining in the Gold to the rest in the bottom of the Pan; and then taking out the Gold, they cast it into the fire that it may still become purer.</P>
<P>After some few days having seen the most remarkable curiosities of <HI>Chremnitz,</HI> I went to <HI>Newsol;</HI> passing those Hills which lie on the East-side of <HI>Chremnitz,</HI> upon the top of one of which lies a vast Stone or Rock alone by it self, near the way-side; these Hills afford wood for the Service of the Gold-Mine. Passing on further we were not far from <HI>Lila,</HI> a Village, where they find Quick-silver; and after we had travelled over the Quick-silver Hills, we came again to the River <HI>Gran,</HI> upon which <HI>Newsol</HI> stands; there is a Bridge of wood to pass the River at this Town, and an handsom building of Piles shoring cross the River to stop the wood thrown into this River, ten miles higher, where the Country is very full of wood: and by this Artifice with∣out labour or charge, it is conveyed to <HI>Newsol,</HI> to be used in the work∣ing of the Copper-Ore, and in the burning, melting, casting, hammering of the Copper.</P>
<P><HI>Newsol</HI> is an handsome Town, and hath a large <HI>Piazza,</HI> at the upper end whereof stands a fair Tower. The Castle also is worth the see∣ing, in which is the Church covered over with Copper; within the Church there are many Figures of carved Wood, and some Reliques: but being in the possession of the <HI>Lutherans</HI> they are not much re∣garded, though carefully preserved. As I also observed in some <HI>Lu∣theran</HI> Churches in <HI>Germany,</HI> as at <HI>Nuremberg,</HI> and <HI>Magdeburg,</HI> where some Reliques had been left; which they have not parted with, but still keep as rarities.</P>
<P>At this Town, and near unto it, are the greatest Copper-works in <HI>Hungary,</HI> the body of the Copper being very strongly united to its Stone, Bed, or Ore, the separation of it is effected with great la∣bour and difficulty; for the Copper-Ore taken out of the Mine is burned and melted fourteen times before that it becomes fit for use; and first it is melted with a Stone which they call <HI>Fluss-stein,</HI> and its own dross, and with <HI>Kis</HI> or a sort of <HI>Pyrites.</HI> It is afterwards carri∣ed to the <HI>Rost-hearth,</HI> where it is laid upon great stacks or heaps of Billets, and those set on fire under it; by which means it is bur∣ned into a substance called <HI>Rost,</HI> and this is repeated seven or eight times; afterwards it is melted again in the melting Furnace, and at two Furnaces more at <HI>Mismills,</HI> and twice at the Hammer.</P>
<P>Here they also melt <HI>Kis</HI> which is brought hither from <HI>Jesina,</HI> which substance melted is serviceable in the melting of Silver.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="42"/>
At <HI>Mismills</HI> not far from hence they get Silver out of Copper, which they seperate thus: They add Lead to the Copper when it is melted, and take out the Metals melted together in Spoons or Iron Dishes. When it is cold they give it a strong fire again as it lies upon cross Bars, untill the Silver and Lead melts and falls through. When the Copper hath passed its last melting and is fit for use, they cut it in pieces, with great Hammers which are sharp, to move every one of which there is a Mill on purpose, which with great force lift∣eth up the Hammer: and to shape and form it into Vessels or Plates, they have other Hammers, which are flat or round according as they intend to frame the Copper.</P>
<P>The Governor of these Works at <HI>Newsol</HI> was highly obliging, and besides the giving us opportunity of seeing every thing we desired, he sent me a handsom present of Wine and Fowls, and wrote a Letter to the Praefect of the Copper-Mine at <HI>Herrn-grundt</HI> to shew me every thing that was curious and observable in that Mine.</P>
<P><HI>Herrn-Grundt</HI> is a little Town seated very high between two Hills, upon a part of Land of the same name, an <HI>Hungarian</HI> mile distant from <HI>Newsol.</HI> The Country about was then all covered with Snow after we came to such a heighth, but in the Valleys, and in our journey from <HI>Newsol</HI> hither we met with none; so that we found the Air very piercing as we passed towards the entrance of the Mine in Miners ha∣bits; which habit consists of a Linen Coat and Drawers, a stiff round Cap, like the crown of a Hat, a leather Apron turned behind, and two pieces of Leather tyed to the Knees, to defend those parts against any sudden striking against the Rocks, or the fall of Earth upon them. In the Mine we were warm enough.</P>
<P>I went into this Mine through a <HI>Cuniculus</HI> called <HI>Tachstoln,</HI> and con∣tinued divers hours in the Mine, and visited many of the most remar∣kable places in it. The sleep descents in this Mine are made by Lad∣ders or Trees set upright, with deep notches or stayers cut in them to stay the foot upon: They are not troubled with water, the Mine lying high in the Hill, so that the water may drain away; but they are mo∣lested with dust, which is choaking and fretting, and also with pernici∣ous damps.</P>
<P>In one place of the Mine they shewed me the manner how they had lately cured a very bad Damp by a great pair of Bellows, which were blown continually for many days; and in divers other places the Damps were so strong as to hinder the Work-men very much in their labour, and these Damps are not only met with in places where the Earth is full of Clay or the like substances, but also where it is rocky, and one place they shewed me where there had been a pernicious Damp, and yet the Rock so hard, that it could not be broken by their Instruments; but the descent was all made by the means of Gun-pow∣der ramm'd into long holes in the Rock, and so blown up.</P>
<P>Much of this Mine lies in the Rocks where they have no need of Wood-work to keep it open, and some passages lie between the Rock and the Earth, so that they are kept open upon one side by Firr-Trees, and on the other side with Stone, the passages also are not so regular as at <HI>Chremnitz,</HI> for many here are neither horizontal, nor near to a per∣pendicular, but moderately inclining up and down, and there are many large Cavities within. In one place where we descended obliquely to
<PB N="68" REF="43"/>
go to a remarkable part of the Mine, we found that the Earth had fal∣len in and stopped up the passage, but one of our Guides unwilling to go about, and the Earth being yet loose, he made a Burrough into it and digged his way through, although the Earth continually fell upon him and covered him; and got at length through and tumbled down amongst the Work-men below, with a great quantity of Earth after him; with which they so speedily laded their Barrows and Hundts, of which I spake before, and the Boys ran away with them with such swift∣ness, that in a short time he made the passage clear again up to the place where he had left us.</P>
<P>The Veins of this Mine are very large, many of them, such as are termed <HI>cumulatoe,</HI> and the Ore is very rich, in an hundred pounds of Ore they ordinarily find twenty pounds of Copper, sometimes thirty, forty, half Copper, and even to sixty in the hundred. Much of the Ore is joyned so fast to the Rock, that 'tis separated with great diffi∣culty, and in many places the Ore and the Rock are one continued Body or Stone, onely with this difference that one part of the Rock will yield Copper, the other none; which is known and distinguished by the colour, and easily at first sight, the Copper-Ore being for the most part, especially the best of it, either yellow or black: The yellow is pure Copper-Ore, the black contains also a proportion of Silver.</P>
<P>There are divers sorts of Vitriol found in this Mine, white, green, blue, and a red clear transparent. There is also a green Earth or Sedi∣ment of a green Water, called <HI>Berg-Grun,</HI> used by the Painters; there are likewise Stones found of a beautiful green and blue colour, and one sort upon which <HI>Turcoises</HI> have been found, and therefore called the Mother of the <HI>Turcois.</HI></P>
<P>There are also two Springs of a Vitriolat Water which turn Iron in∣to Copper, called the old and the new <HI>Ziment;</HI> these Springs lie very deep in the Mine, and the Iron is ordinarily left in the water fourteen days. These Waters are very profitable, seeing that the worst sort of Iron, and useless old Iron is hereby turned into the purest sort of Cop∣per, which hath this commendation above other Copper to be more ductile, malleable, and easily melted; and I have melted it without the addition of any other substance, without difficulty. Whilst the Ore of Copper must run through many Fires and Furnaces to be brought to any thing. Of this sort of Copper I took a good quantity out of the old <HI>Ziment,</HI> and I took also a piece of Copper of the Figure of a Heart which had been layed in it eleven or twelve days before; having the same Figure, but as perfectly Iron then, as it is at this day Copper. Some will not have this to be a Transmutation of one Metal into ano∣ther, but that this Water of the <HI>Ziment</HI> being saturated with a <HI>Vitrio∣lum Veneris,</HI> and meeting with such a body so ready to receive it as <HI>Mars,</HI> it deposes <HI>Venus,</HI> who immediately insinuates her self so far into <HI>Mars,</HI> that she doth <HI>dividere &amp; imperare,</HI> and at last she substi∣tutes her own body, and precipitates that of <HI>Mars.</HI></P>
<P>In the changing of Iron into Copper in these Springs, many parts are indeed often separated, and lie at the bottom in powder, but these parts are not Iron but Copper; and I have taken of this powder out of the Spring, and melted it into excellent Copper; so that if the Iron be not changed, I know not what becomes of it. This Operation
<PB N="69" REF="43"/>
which nature so curiously performs in the Mine, I have since seen at∣tempted to be imitated by Art; and in my judgment successfully.</P>
<P>After that I had seen many of the most remarkable places in the Mine, I returned to the <HI>Verwalter</HI> of <HI>Herrn-Grundt</HI> his House, and put my clothes on again in the Stove: where we were afterwards very kindly entertained. He shewed me a Map of that Mine wherein we had spent most part of that day; and the delineations of all those places we had been at, with a Scale to measure the lengths and distan∣ces of all Passages and Places in the Mine; and it was very delightful to see so large a Draught or Picture of so fair a Subterraneous City: nor can I term it less, in which there is more building than in many. The extent surpasses most, and the number of the Inhabitants are conside∣rable, their Order admirable, their Watches exact, their Rest undi∣sturbed, grateful after Labour and refreshing, they reposing themselves eight hours in the hollow of a Rock after the same time spent in labour; besides this Map, he shew'd me many curious Minerals taken out of that Mine, and by heating the Copper-Ore, and casting it into water, made the water like some natural Baths which arise near these Hills. And upon my commending the <HI>Ziment</HI> water and its strange Opera∣tion upon Iron, he presented me with divers fair pieces, and a chain of Copper transmuted in those Springs. They make also very hand∣some Cups and Vessels out of this sort of Copper, and we drank out of one of them which was gilded over, and had a rich piece of Silver-Ore fastned in the middle of it; and this Inscription graved on the outside:
<Q><L>Eisen ware ich, Kupser bin ich</L>
<L>Silber trag ich, Goldt bedeckt mich. <HI>i. c.</HI></L></Q>
<Q><L>Copper I am, but Iron was of old,</L>
<L>Silver I carry, cover'd am with Gold,</L></Q></P>
<P>The profit which the Emperor makes by his Mines, is reckoned to amount to an hundred and twenty Thousand pounds <HI>sterling</HI> yearly. But when they come to deal with deeper and richer veins of Ore, and that there shall be by degrees more of these Vitriolate Copper springs discovered, this revenue will then be encreased. And it is more than probable that time will bring more of them to light; for at <HI>Zolnock,</HI> and other places near the <HI>Carpathian</HI> Hills there are divers of the same springs already made use of. But if furthermore, considering the no∣bleness of these springs, containing in them the true mature Salt of <HI>Ve∣nus,</HI> some Persons hereafter shall be so fortunate, as moreover to dis∣cover and experimentally improve the use of Springs and Fountains saturated with a <HI>Vitriolum Lunoe,</HI> and learn perfectly how to adapt Metalline Bodies to the adaequate energy, and activity of such waters; The improvement by transmutation as it is at present more than ten to one, so it will in those dayes amount to above a hundred to one, and the use of these Mines and Metalline labours may hereby effectually prove in times to come one of the Richest Jewels in the Imperial Crown.</P>
<P>From <HI>Herrn-Grundt</HI> we came to <HI>Stubn,</HI> a Town three <HI>Hungarian</HI> miles distant from <HI>Newsol,</HI> and two from <HI>Chremnitz;</HI> where near unto
<PB N="70" REF="44"/>
a Rivolet there are divers hot Baths of great esteem, and much fre∣quented; the water whereof is very clear and sinells of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> the Se∣diment green; it colours the wood over it green and black, but doth not change the colour of Metals so soon as most others; I left money in it a whole night, which was yet but faintly coloured. The Springs arise underneath, and pass through the holes in the plancher of the Baths.</P>
<P>The heat of these is answerable to that of the Kings-Bath in <HI>Eng∣land;</HI> there are seven in number: The first is the Noblemans Bath, the second the Gentlemans, the third the Country-mans, the fourth the Country-womans, the fifth the Beggars Bath, the sixth for such as are infected with the <HI>Lues Venerea,</HI> the seventh the Bath of the <HI>Gypsies.</HI> These Baths are in a Plain encompassed on all sides with Hills, the nighest unto them are towards the East; and it is the same ridge of Hills which on the other side are so rich in Metals. I bath'd in one of these and met good company that I was detained too long, and received some inconvenience from the heat of the Bath, nor could I commend their custom of eating, drinking, and sleeping much while they bathed.</P>
<P>From <HI>Stub'n Bad</HI> we went to <HI>Boinitz,</HI> crossing the River <HI>Nitra</HI> and leaving <HI>Privitz</HI> a large Town on the left hand. At <HI>Boinitz</HI> there are also five natural Baths of a moderate gentle heat delightful to bath in, being much beautified by Count <HI>Palfi</HI> Palatine of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and all of them covered under one large roof. The first is the Noblemans Bath built of Stone, descended into on all sides by Stone stairs; the other four are of wood, very handsomely and well built, where it was a plea∣sure to us to see the Boys and Girls dive so finely for any thing that we cast in. About this part of the Country there grows very much Saffron.</P>
<P>From <HI>Boinitz</HI> we went to <HI>Westonitz,</HI> two <HI>Hungarian</HI> miles, and from <HI>Westonitz</HI> the next day, we arrived at <HI>Trenschin,</HI> which they count four <HI>Hungarian</HI> miles; but such long ones they are, that we were travelling from before Sun-rising till eight of the Clock at night, before we could come to our journeys end.</P>
<P><HI>Trenschin</HI> is a handsome Town seated upon the River <HI>Waag,</HI> over which there is a Bridge of wood; the <HI>Piazza</HI> is fair, the Jesuites Church handsome, the Castle seated very high, easily discernable at twenty <HI>English</HI> miles distance, and belonged to the <HI>Graff Jellhasey.</HI> There are two warm Baths a mile from the Town, and a great num∣ber of Springs of Mineral waters in the Country about. Here we met with Count <HI>Rothall</HI> going from the Emperor to treat with <HI>Abaffi</HI> Prince of <HI>Transylvania</HI> his Commissioners at <HI>Eperies,</HI> where I engaged some of his Attendants to make enquiry into the Salt-Mines of that place, or any other, according to the instructions I left with them, and after∣wards I received an Account to this effect.</P>
<P>Half an hours going from the City of <HI>Eperies</HI> in upper <HI>Hungary,</HI> there is a Salt-Mine of great note from the first place of descent unto the bottom, it is about one hundred and fourscore fathoms deep. Into this the Miners descend first by Ropes, and at last by Ladders unto the lower parts. The Mine is for the most part in an Earthy, and not a Rocky ground.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="44"/>
The Veins of Salt are large, and there are pieces to be found of ten thousand pound weight: they commonly hew out the Salt into long square pieces of two foot in length, and one in thickness, and for use it is broken and grinded between two Grind stones.</P>
<P>The Mine is cold and moist, but the Salt being a Stone salt, is not easily dissolved, or at least in any great quantity by dampness or moi∣sture; yet much of the water of the Mine is impregnated with salt, in such sort that being drawn out in large buckets, and afterwards boyl'd up, it affords a blackish Salt, which they give to their Cattle in that Country.</P>
<P>The colour of the ordinary Stone-salt of this Mine is not very white, but somewhat grey: yet being broken and grinded to powder, it be∣comes as white as if it were refined, and this Salt consists of pointed parts or fossets. Another sort of Salt there is also, which consists of Squares and Tables; and a third to be found of somewhat stirious or long shoots.</P>
<P>Nor is all the Salt of this Mine of one colour, but of divers; that which is found grosly mixt with the Earth receives some colour from it; and even that which is most pure and resembles Crystal, doth often receive tinctures of several colours; in the middle of a Crystal∣salt with long shoots, I have seen a delicate blue; and at Count <HI>Ro∣thall</HI> his House at <HI>Vienna,</HI> I saw a large piece of a fair transparent yellow. There are also some pieces so clear and hard, that they carve them into divers Figures, as if they were Crystal it self. Of all these sorts men∣tioned I also obtained some pieces, and brought them with me into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But it is time to conclude this long discourse of Mines and Minerals, which may seem of little concern unto many; yet for the satisfaction of the more curious in so considerable a piece of Naturals, in places lit∣tle known unto us; and withal, undescribed by any <HI>English</HI> Pen that I know; I would not omit this particular account thereof.</P>
<P>I continued my journey near to the River <HI>Waag,</HI> and came to <HI>Nove Mnesto,</HI> and from thence the next day to <HI>Tirnaw,</HI> a City seated upon a Plain, and to be seen at a great distance; it hath almost recovered it self out of the Ashes that it was reduced into six years before: the day following we got to the <HI>Danube</HI> again, and lodged that night at <HI>Pres∣burg,</HI> whereof I have spoken elsewhere; and then passing the <HI>Danube</HI> in two Ferry-boats, we travelled by <HI>Homburg</HI> Tower, by <HI>Haimberg</HI> Hill, by the Town of <HI>Haimberg,</HI> by <HI>Regelsbrun, Vischet</HI> and <HI>Swechet,</HI> and came to <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P>A great part of these Countries of upper <HI>Hungaria,</HI> through which I travelled, had a different face from that of <HI>Austria,</HI> and from what they had formerly been. For some places had been burnt or plundred by the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Turks</HI> in the late war, and divers pay contribution to them, so that many live warily and meanly to become less noted: And in divers places their Houses are bare and unfurnished; and it is well if they have any other Bed than one for the man of the House and his Wife. Even in parts of the Country better provided, and un∣der the Emperor, a great part of the people being of the <HI>Lutheran,</HI> or the reformed Religion, are under such hard measure and fears that they live in little content, and being of a stout and persevering temper, they may in time become so desperate, that if the <HI>Turk</HI> should break power∣fully
<PB N="72" REF="45"/>
in, 'tis probable they would not fight so heartily against him as in times past. There are many <HI>Calvinists,</HI> many <HI>Lutherans.</HI> They were formerly almost all <HI>Lutherans</HI> in the Mine-Towns, but now the Offi∣cers are of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church. At <HI>Schemnitz</HI> a very fair Church was lately taken from the <HI>Lutherans;</HI> and they told me that at <HI>Boinitz,</HI> and the Country about, Count <HI>Palfi</HI> caused all his <HI>Lutheran</HI> Tenants to change, or at least to declare the change of their Religion, or else to part with their Houses and Lands: There are also many <HI>Anabaptists</HI> up and down, more observed for their neat working in Mother of Pearl than any thing else. The <HI>Unitarii</HI> live in the farther parts of upper <HI>Hunga∣ry</HI> towards <HI>Transylvania,</HI> and have the commendation to speak general∣ly <HI>Latin,</HI> even the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Catholicks are much dissatisfied at the intrusion of the <HI>Germans,</HI> and their encroaching upon them, they look jealously upon the Court at <HI>Vienna,</HI> think themselves not regarded ac∣cording to their merits or ability of their Services, nor the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Privileges well observed, so that they can scarce dissemble their Dis∣contents, which may in time prove of very bad consequence.</P>

<P>WHILE I remained at <HI>Vienna,</HI> I took the pains to see di∣vers places not far distant from it, as <HI>Néugebáu, Kalen∣berg, Closter, Newberg, Itzing, Baden, Laxamburg, New∣sidler-See,</HI> with others; and afterwards made a jour∣ney unto <HI>Venice,</HI> not by the Stage-Coaches which keep one constant road, but chose rather to perform it by Horse whereby I might stay in any place, or go out of the road at pleasure.</P>
<P>The first considerable place we saw was <HI>Baden,</HI> about four <HI>German</HI> miles from <HI>Vienna,</HI> a pretty walled Town seated near a part of Mount <HI>Cetius,</HI> which divided <HI>Noricum</HI> from <HI>Pannonia;</HI> a Rivolet named <HI>Swe∣chet</HI> passes by it, which afterwards enlarges and runs into the <HI>Da∣nube</HI> about a <HI>German</HI> mile from <HI>Vienna,</HI> there are three Churches, that of the <HI>Augustiners,</HI> of our Lady, and S. <HI>Stephen;</HI> but this place is most remarkable for its Baths which are much frequented from <HI>Vienna</HI> and these parts. The Springs being numerous and affording nine conveni∣ent Baths, two within the Town, five without the Wall, and two be∣yond a Rivolet called <HI>Swechet.</HI></P>
<P>The Dukes-Bath is the largest, about twenty foot square, in the mid∣dle of a House of the same Figure, built over it. The vapour passes through a tunnel of Wood, at the top: and the Water is conveyed into the bottom of the Bath, at one corner through wooden pipes and Trees, under the Town-wall, from the Spring head, which rises at a little distance Westward. The Springs of the rest of the Baths rise under them, and let in through holes of the Plancher, for all the Baths are Wainscoted, the Seats, Sides, and Bottom being made of Firr. The Wa∣ter for the most part is clear and transparent, yet somewhat blewish, and makes the Skin appear pale in it, in the same manner as the Smoak of
<PB N="74" REF="46"/>
Brimstone, it coloureth Metals (except Gold, the colour of which it also heightens) turning them black in a few minutes. The Coyn of this Country, which is mixed of Copper and Silver, (having 7/15 of Sil∣ver, and 8/15 of Copper) is in a minutes time turned from a white into a dark yellow, and soon after becomes black. It gives a fine green colour to the Moss and Plants which it washes, and leaves often a scum upon them of a purple, mixed with white As it runs from the Spring-head, it somewhat resembles the Sulphur River in the way from <HI>Tivoli</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> but is not so strange or stinking nor doth it incrustate its banks.</P>
<P>The Spring head is also considerable, in regard that it rises under a rocky Hill, at some distance from the entrance, and I passed to it a∣bout the length of forty yards, through an Arched passage cut in the Rock, which is also a natural stove, (as that of <HI>Tritola</HI> and <HI>Baiae▪)</HI> made by the hot Bath water running under it, most part of the top of this Cave is incrustated with a white substance which towards the mouth becomes harder and stony. I caused some of the Pipes through which the Bath water runs to be opened, and from the upper part of the Pipe. I took some quantity of the Sulphur in powder, it being very like flowers of Brimstone, this being as it were sublimed from the water and not deposed, it being found in the upper part of the Pipe, <HI>oleum Sulphu∣ris per campanum</HI> dropped into this water, is received into it quietly, <HI>Oleum Tartari per deliquium</HI> causes an ebullition as in the making of <HI>Tartarum Vitriolatum.</HI></P>
<P>The Second Bath within the Wall is our Lady's Bath, about twelve foot broad and twenty four foot long. One end of this is under a Church of the same name. This is fuller of Sulphur than the rest, and more blew, and leaves a yellow flower upon the boards, as the others do a white.</P>
<P>The Third is the New Bath, without the Town near the Gate, when I saw it, it was full of People who were making merry and singing.</P>
<P>The Fourth is the Jews Bath, this hath a partition in the middle, to separate the Men from the Women.</P>
<P>The Fifth is St. <HI>John's</HI> Bath of a triangular Figure.</P>
<P>The Sixth is the Beggars Bath, alwayes shallow so as they lie down in it.</P>
<P>The Seventh is the Bath of the holy Cross, about two sathoms square, chiefly for the Clergy.</P>
<P>The Eighth is St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Bath, this is greener than the rest.</P>
<P>The Ninth is the Sower-Bath, this is set about with stone Balastres, and covered with a handsome Cupola and a Lanthorn, the Water is ve∣ry clear, in the stream of this Bath I have often coloured Money black without touching the Water; yet the Water it self being once cold changes not the colour of Metals, although they be boyled in it.</P>
<P>The hottest of these Baths have not the heat of the Queens Bath at <HI>Bathe</HI> in <HI>England.</HI> They use no Guides as with us, but direct them∣selves with a short turned Staff.</P>
<P>Here we met with very good Company, and all kind of accommo∣dation at no dear rate. A Captain of the Emperour's whom I had ac∣companied to these Baths as a token of his love gave me a <HI>Gempskugel</HI> which is said to be an excrescence upon the Liver of a wild Goat of <HI>Tyrol,</HI> and highly cryed up in <HI>Germany</HI> for a signal remedy against the
<PB N="75" REF="46"/>
diseases of the Liver, malignant Fevers and the Plague, and many are so obstinately credulous as to think that whosoever takes it becomes in∣vulnerable for twenty four hours after.</P>
<P>Having bathed in the Baths, and taken a draught of the Town, I left <HI>Baden,</HI> and the next considerable place was <HI>Newstad,</HI> one of the chiefest Cities in <HI>Austria;</HI> it is of a square Figure with a <HI>Piazza</HI> in the middle of it, two sides whereof are arched and supported with Pillars: there are four Gates, three whereof are to be seen from the <HI>Piazza;</HI> St. <HI>Jacobs</HI> is the chiefest Church, which hath two Steeples in the Front. The Emperor hath a Palace here of a square Building with four Towers, which are to be seen a great way off, as is also most part of the Town, as lying in a Marish Ground, and in a plain Country; it is encompas∣sed with a Ditch and two Walls, the one very low, the other seems not strong; yet as they told me, at one time the <HI>Turk</HI> could not take it, but left it upon condition that they might take something out of the Town; which being granted, they took the <HI>Pronger</HI> or <HI>Whipping-Post,</HI> and carried it unto <HI>Constantinople;</HI> and at another time in the Year 1529. <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent stormed it seven times in one day, and was every time repulsed. At this place Count <HI>Peter Serini</HI> and <HI>Frangipani</HI> were beheaded, as being chief Contrivers in the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Revolt.</P>
<P>From hence through the Plains we came to Mount <HI>Simeren</HI> passing by <HI>Newkirckel,</HI> where there is a Chappel with a little red Pinnacle which they say was built by an <HI>English</HI> King; I suppose by King <HI>Richard</HI> the first, who was kept Prisoner in <HI>Austria</HI> in his return from the Holy Land, whose Ransom built the old Walls of <HI>Vienna.</HI> Mount <HI>Simeren</HI> is a part of Mount <HI>Cetius</HI> upon the top whereof lies an heap of Stones which make the boundary between <HI>Austria</HI> and <HI>Styria;</HI> the ascent of the Hill is steep and stony; so that sometimes it takes twenty four Hor∣ses or Oxen to draw up a Cart or Coach.</P>
<P>We lodged at <HI>Schotwien</HI> or <HI>Schadtwien,</HI> a strange Town seated between Rocks upon the passage of the Hills, the Houses upon the sides of the Rocks are inaccessible but from the Top of the Hills, and looking over the Plains, serve for Watch-Towers; this is a close strong place, and called by some <HI>Claustra Austriae;</HI> having the Mountains on each hand, and shut up with a Gate at each end; a small current coming down from the Hills, is admitted into the Town under the Wall, which put me in mind of the Picture of the Wall to the Kingdom of <HI>China,</HI> wherein is expressed the manner of the Rivers running into <HI>China,</HI> the Wall being still continued over them. From hence I came to <HI>Mehrzuschlag,</HI> the place where they beat out the Iron into Bars; so to <HI>Keimburg</HI> passing by a swist small River named <HI>Murtz,</HI> then travelled by a Castle belong∣ing to the Family of <HI>Stubnberg,</HI> which is esteemed one of the Ancientest in <HI>Germany,</HI> and came to <HI>Prug,</HI> seated upon the River <HI>Mur</HI> or <HI>Muer,</HI> a swift large River, but not navigable, although after it hath passed by <HI>Gratz</HI> and <HI>Rakenburg</HI> it enlarges. <HI>Prug</HI> or <HI>Muripons</HI> is not ill built considering the Country, and hath a fair <HI>Piazza.</HI> Another Town of this name I had seen before seated upon the River <HI>Leyta,</HI> and for di∣stinction called <HI>Prug</HI> upon the <HI>Leyta,</HI> so forward by <HI>Luheim</HI> where the Staple of Iron is. I came to <HI>Knitelfeldt</HI> and <HI>Judenburg</HI> still nigh to the River <HI>Mur,</HI> the next day to <HI>Hundtsmark</HI> and <HI>Newmark,</HI> then to <HI>Frei∣sach,</HI> which some think to have been <HI>Virunum,</HI> others <HI>Vacorium,</HI> in sight
<PB N="76" REF="47"/>
of <HI>Altenhofn,</HI> the Castle of <HI>Itrowitz,</HI> and the Castle of <HI>Tottenbrun,</HI> which belongs to the Arch-bishop of <HI>Saltzburg.</HI></P>
<P>Then to St. <HI>Veit</HI> or St. <HI>Faith,</HI> formerly the chief City of <HI>Carinthia,</HI> seated upon the Confluence of the River <HI>Glan</HI> and <HI>Wunich,</HI> it is walled about, hath six Churches in it, a <HI>Piazza</HI> also, and in the same a remar∣kable Fountain with a Laver or Bason of white Marble made out of one Stone, which was five of my fathoms in circumference: this noble An∣tiquity was brought from <HI>Saal</HI> or <HI>Zolfeldt,</HI> a place not far off, and abounding with <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquities.</P>

<P>In sight of <HI>Ʋitopolis</HI> or St. <HI>Veit,</HI> there are four remarkable Hills, as the Hill of St. <HI>Veit,</HI> St. <HI>Ʋlrick,</HI> St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> and St. <HI>Helena,</HI> with a Chappel upon each of them, to all these upon one day in the year the Inhabitants go in devotion on foot, although to perform the same they must travel above thirty <HI>English</HI> miles.</P>
<P>We stayed at St. <HI>Veit,</HI> and had the divertisement of a <HI>Latine</HI> Come∣dy at the <HI>Franciscan</HI> Convent, it was in <HI>May</HI> when the higher Hills were covered with snow, but the lower were all green, full of Firr
<PB N="77" REF="47"/>
and Larch-trees, it thundred and lightned very much, and as soon as it began they rung their Bells. Many here have great throats, some as big as their heads, many are blind, divers dumb and fools withal; with∣out the Town there is an Hospital for such as have lost their voice, their wits, or are otherwise oppressed by their great throats, many of them cover their throats, which otherwise are very ill complexioned in cold weather. Men and Women have them, the better sort of People, which live well, drink wine and good beer, are less subject to them. I saw big∣ger throats in these parts, than any I had observed in the <HI>Alpine</HI> parts of <HI>Savoy.</HI></P>
<P>St. <HI>Veit,</HI> whose name this place bears, was a zealous Christian who laboured much in the Conversion of these parts, and was persecuted under <HI>Dioclesian.</HI> Many Churches and Towns do carry his name in other parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and the People have an opinion of St. <HI>Veit</HI> in the curing of that dacing disease called <HI>Chorea Sancti Viti.</HI></P>
<P>From hence we travelled to <HI>Saal,</HI> or <HI>Solua,</HI> anciently a <HI>Roman</HI> Colony, and set down in the Map of <HI>Wolfgangus Lazius</HI> by the name of <HI>Colonia Soluensis;</HI> a Field near unto it, is called <HI>Ager Soluensis</HI> or <HI>Zolfeldt,</HI> a place very fruitful in Antiquities, many whereof have been carried into other parts: in this Field I saw that much spoken of▪ Antiquity of the Kings Chair; it is made of Stone set together in the form of two Elbow-Chairs turned back to back. Upon three of the Stones there are Inscrip∣tions, but surely more ancient than the Chair. At the installing of the Duke of <HI>Carinthia,</HI> whether he be King, Prince, or Emperor; either he himself or his Substitute sits in one part of the Chair towards the East, and a Baur or Country-man in the other part of the Chair toward the West; and among other Ceremonies, the Country-man rises up and presents the Duke with a fat and lean Ox; the Duke is obliged to take the lean and return the fat one, and afterwards to receive a gentle box on the ear from the Country-man, and so after this manner is installed.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>Saal</HI> is very ancient, and hath escaped the fury of the Barbarous Nations; herein I saw the Tomb of <HI>Modestus</HI> a Companion of S. <HI>Veit,</HI> it is a plain Monument, and they have a Tradition here, that the Tomb hath removed it self about a yard nearer unto the Altar than where it was first placed. On the Church Walls are many old <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquities of good <HI>Basso relievo,</HI> which were first taken out of <HI>Zolfeldt;</HI> those which I chieflly observed were these. <HI>A Chariot with two Horses. A Chariot and a man in it. A Wolf licking of fruit fallen from a Tree. Hector fastned unto the Cha∣riot of</HI> Achilles <HI>as he was drawn about</HI> Troy. <HI>Four fair Heads unto the middle. Two Wolves, each holding a Horn and a Cup be∣tween them, out of which shoots a Vine with Leaves and Grapes,</HI> this is over the Porch. Within the Porch is a <HI>Cupid</HI> holding of a bunch of Grapes. <HI>Romulus</HI> and <HI>Remus</HI> sucking of a Wolf. Two figures over the Crucisix by S <HI>Christopher,</HI> with some others, all which <HI>Zolfeldt</HI> afforded; where I also saw many Inscriptions, one upon a stone on the South-side of the Church was this,

also divers <HI>Roman</HI> Coins of Copper and Silver found in these parts, and I brought away a Medal of <HI>Trajan</HI>'s in Gold.</P>
<P>From thence we came to <HI>Clagenfurt</HI> or <HI>Claudia</HI> of old, which is at present the chief Town in <HI>Carinthia,</HI> a fair four square Town enclosed with an handsom Wall; the Rampart is very broad; at each corner there is a Bastion, and one in the middle of each Curtain; the Streets are strait and uniform as well as the Works; there is also a very fair <HI>Piazza</HI> in the middle. For the beauty of this place they are behold∣en to the Industrious <HI>Lutherans</HI> while they held this Country: The <HI>Piazza</HI> is adorned with a Column of Marble, and a Statue of the Vir∣gin upon it, also with a Statue of the Emperor, but above all with a noble Fountain in the middle, over which is a large prodigious Dra∣gon made out of one Stone, <HI>Hercules</HI> with a Club standing before it, which the people think to be the Statue of a Baur which killed this Dragon in these parts. This was also brought from the above mention∣ed Field of <HI>Saal.</HI> There are three noble Massy Fountains observable in these hilly parts, these two of St. <HI>Veit</HI> and <HI>Clagenfurt,</HI> and another of white Marble at <HI>Saltzburg.</HI></P>
<P>Among the odd Customs of <HI>Carinthia</HI> there is an old one delivered<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>By</HI> Aenaeas Sylvius.</NOTE> of this place, that if a man were vehemently suspected of theft, they hanged him, and three days after judged of the Fact; if he were found guilty they let his body hang till it was corrupted, if otherwise, they took down the body, buried it upon the publick account, and said prayers for his soul. <HI>Clagenfurt</HI> was then full of Souldiers, where I had the honour to see Count <HI>Lesley</HI> the chief Commander, Baron <HI>la Hay,</HI> and my Lord <HI>Peasly</HI> who had a Company in the Town, whose singular civilities and favours I cannot sufficiently acknowledge, they obliged me to be at their Table while I stayed, and one day my Lord <HI>Lesley</HI> carried me in his Barge through a handsom streight cut into the Werd-Sea or Lake of <HI>Clagenfurt</HI> to a house of pleasure called <HI>Loretto,</HI> finely seated, and which hath a Chappel in it, built after the same manner with that of <HI>Loretto</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> which having formerly seen, I was the bet∣ter able to confirm the exact imitation of it. Count <HI>Lesley</HI> is related to <HI>Montecuculi,</HI> and so was pleased to give me Letters to <HI>Vienna,</HI> and to other parts: The honour I had to know the right honourable the Earl of <HI>Norwich,</HI> Earl Marshal of <HI>England,</HI> did much encrease my kind reception among them, whose worthy name I found not only known in the Dominions of the Empire, but afterwards also in <HI>Turky.</HI></P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Clagenfurt,</HI> I continued my Journey Southward, and af∣ter a <HI>German</HI> mile and half crossed the River <HI>Dravus</HI> where I found it already a large swift River, passing over two long Bridges of Wood, and an Island in the middle; and after an hour or two I began to enter between the Hills at a place called the <HI>Hammer,</HI> where the Iron is bea∣ten out, and proceeded in order to my passage over Mount <HI>Luibel.</HI>

In a short time entering into as odd a desert of Rocks as may be seen, where th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re is a great <HI>Cascata</HI> or fall of waters, and the water hath so worn the Rocks that all seems to be artificial: the way up is made with Walls, turning backward and forward with great pains, and grea∣ter Art than I could have expected in this Country. And in this manner we went on winding backward and forward till we reached the highest passage of the great Mountain <HI>Luibol,</HI> which is part a of the <HI>Carnick Alpes,</HI> dividing <HI>Carinthia</HI> and <HI>Carniola,</HI> and one of the most remark∣able Hills I ever saw; for having passed up as high as the steep Rocks and Peaks would permit, we turned sidewise by a made way which led us into a hole or passage cut quite through the Mountain, imita∣ting the samed <HI>Grotto</HI> of the Hill <HI>Pansilipo</HI> by <HI>Naples:</HI> there is a Roof of Wood-work in the middle, which is continued unto the <HI>Carniolian</HI> side; the Roof of this passage is high, the lenghth of it is 156 yards, and it is four yards broad.</P>
<P>The manner of passing through this Hill was surprizing unto me, having never read nor heard hereof before, I thought it might be some work of the old <HI>Romans,</HI> but I was afterwards informed that it was much later, and that if former time there was no passage into <HI>Carniola</HI> this way, but they went about by <HI>Villach.</HI> At first sight of this hole when I was far below it, I conjectured it might be th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itation or Chappel of some Hermit, but could not imagin how he should come unto it, till at last by the winding and turning of the way up the Hill, I did not onely pass through it my self, but met with divers Passengers who came out of <HI>Carniola,</HI> and it is so well contrived, that the Country carriages and Carts pass through it every day.</P>
<P>In ascending this Hill we had bad weather, rain and fierce hail, and and the snow laid still by the way-side; and being so high at the time of a strom, I had an opportunity to see the Clouds descend, and after it was past to ascend again so high, as to got over part of the Mountain, and a stream of them passed through the hole out of <HI>Carniola</HI> into <HI>Carin∣thia,</HI> oppositely unto us who passed out of <HI>Carinthia</HI> into <HI>Carniola,</HI> or out of <HI>Karnten</HI> into <HI>Craen.</HI></P>
<P>This noble passage being already so well contrived, and in the Country of a laborious and industrious people, is like to be continued, who remove the snow with great pains in the Winter, and keep the way passable, and as we continually ascended till we came to this <HI>Grotto,</HI> so when we were once got through it we always descended, &amp; came first to S. <HI>Anna,</HI> two <HI>English</HI> miles downward, then to <HI>Newstuttel</HI> a <HI>German</HI> mile and half further still descending, and proceeded forward till we came to <HI>Crainburg,</HI> which is thought to have been formerly <HI>Carnodunum,</HI> a good Town seated upon the River <HI>Savus,</HI> from whence through a fair Plain four <HI>German</HI> miles long, we came to <HI>Labach</HI> or <HI>Lubiana</HI> the chief City of <HI>Carniola;</HI> the River <HI>Labach</HI> runs through it, which falls after∣wards into the <HI>Savus.</HI> It is an handsome City with a Castle seated up∣on an Hill which over-looks two large Valleys to the North and South, and hath a fair Prospect of many Hills and Castles, but being commanded but another Hill not far from it, it is neglected, although we find that it hath endured a strong Siege, for while the Emperor <HI>Fre∣derick</HI> was receiving the Crown at <HI>Aken,</HI> his Brother <HI>Albertus</HI> and Count <HI>Ʋlrick</HI> took the advantage to besiege it, but it made so good re∣sistance that the Emperor had time to raise the Siege and destroy the
<PB N="80" REF="50"/>
Army. At <HI>Labach</HI> I happily met with Mr. <HI>Tosh</HI> a <HI>Scotch</HI> Apothecary in that Town, who was very civil unto me, informing me of the places about, and shewing me many Curiosities, and the several Minerals of those parts.</P>
<P>This place is conceived to be old <HI>Nauportus</HI> famous for the landing of the <HI>Argonautes,</HI> who setting forth from <HI>Argos Pelasgicum</HI> in <HI>Thessa∣ly</HI> sailed unto <HI>Colchos</HI> on the East side of the <HI>Euxine Sea,</HI> but being pursued by the King of <HI>Colchos</HI> his Vessels dispatched after them, they declined returning by the <HI>Hellespont,</HI> but bearing Northward entred the mouth of <HI>Ister</HI> or <HI>Danubius,</HI> and passed up the River till they came to the concurrence of the <HI>Danubius</HI> and the <HI>Savus,</HI> and taking up the <HI>Savus</HI> they came to the River <HI>Labach,</HI> and went up that River landing about this place anciently called <HI>Nauportus,</HI> and then travelled to the <HI>Adriatick Sea</HI> and returned unto <HI>Greece.</HI> So that in my travels I had been near their setting out in <HI>Thessaly,</HI> and at the place of their landing in <HI>Carniola.</HI></P>
<P>From hence we travelled towards the <HI>Zirchnitzer-See,</HI> or famous strange Lake of <HI>Zirchnitz</HI> having the Marshes on our right, hand, and the Hills on our left till we came to <HI>Brounitza,</HI> and then passing over them we came to <HI>Zirchnitz,</HI> a Town of about three hundred Houses, which gives the name unto the Lake, here I applyed my self unto <HI>An∣dreas Wifer</HI> the <HI>Richter</HI> or Judge of the Town who afforded me di∣rections and accommodations for the viewing of the Lake; and went down to <HI>Seedorff,</HI> a Village half a mile nearer the Lake, and then to <HI>Ni∣derdorff,</HI> where I took Boat and spent some time upon the Lake.</P>
<P>This Lake is about two <HI>German</HI> miles long, and one broad, encom∣passed with Hills at some distance, and upon the South-side lies a Forest part of <HI>Birnbaumer</HI> Forest, which extends a great way, where∣in are many Dear, wild Boars, Foxes, Wolves and Bears.</P>
<P>Every year in some part of the Month of <HI>June,</HI> the water of this Lake descends under ground through many great holes at the bot∣toms; and in the Month of <HI>September</HI> returns again by the same holes; and with a speedy ascent, springing and mounting up to the heighth of a Pike, and soon covering that tract of ground again. When the water is under-ground, the Earth makes a speedy production of of Grass yielding food for Cattel in the Winter, and at the same time, Hares, Deer and Boars resort to this place out of the Country, and the fore-mentioned Forest, and are often taken by the people.</P>
<P>The Lake affords plenty of Fish, but they fish but by permission, for the Prince of <HI>Eckenberg</HI> is Lord thereof, and a good part of the Country about, but upon the going away of the water, all have liber∣ty to take Fish, which they do by standing in the water by the holes, and so intercepting their passage take great plenty of them, which o∣therwise would follow the water under-ground, and not returns again until <HI>September.</HI> I could not hear that any unknown Fishes were brought up by the water, but those which come up are of the same kind with those which went down, which are a kind of Carp, Tench, Eels, and such as are common in other Lakes; and they are rather gainers than Loosers hereby, when they come up, for the Fish having spawned before, the fry that goes down hath had about three months growth under ground when they are brought up again.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="50"/>
The Ground under the Lake is very unequal, and the water not near of the same depth, but in some places four foot, and then suddenly again twenty yards deep: and because the Fish frequent the Valleys or deep∣er places, more than the Hills or eminent parts, the Fishermen who know the place wet and dry, have given unto seven of these Valleys peculiar names, which in the <HI>Sclavonian,</HI> the Language of that Coun∣try, are these,</P>

<P>I passed over the five first mentioned Valleys, and went to a noted Stone called the Fishers Stone, by the appearance whereof they can conjecture how soon the water will descend, and by an Hill, which when the water is high becomes a pleasant Island, and then return∣ed.</P>
<P>They can give no account that this Lake hath failed any year to descend and arise again, or have any tradition how long this property of the Lake hath been observed. Some Lakes have been made by Earth-quakes, but it is more probable that this hath been from all Anti∣quity, and according to the best conjectures, this is the <HI>Lugea Palus</HI> of <HI>Strabo,</HI> and therefore more strange that the Ancients are silent in this remarkable account.</P>
<P>The nearest Sea unto this Lake is the <HI>Sinus Tergestinus,</HI> and <HI>Sinus Flanaticus,</HI> the Gulf of <HI>Trieste,</HI> and the Gulf of <HI>Quevero.</HI> And not ma∣ny miles from hence are the Heads of divers considerable Rivers, as that of <HI>Labach,</HI> the <HI>Corcoras</HI> or <HI>Gurk,</HI> the <HI>Colapis</HI> or <HI>Culp,</HI> which run into the <HI>Savus.</HI> The <HI>Vipao</HI> or <HI>amnis frigdus</HI> which runs into <HI>Ly∣sonso</HI> by <HI>Goritia,</HI> and divers more, but whither these Rivers arise where the Lake falls, I could not learn.</P>
<P>The Ground not far from this Lake is very hollow and full of Ca∣verns, and I observed many Caverns and deep holes in other parts of <HI>Carniola</HI> somewhat like unto <HI>Elden</HI> hole in <HI>Darbyshire,</HI> and I was in∣formed by the most considerable persons at <HI>Zirchnitz</HI> that the Prince of <HI>Eckenberg</HI> had the curiosity to go into one of them, and came out again upon the side of an Hill.</P>
<P>I was upon consideration whether I should go from hence unto <HI>Ter∣gestum</HI> now <HI>Trieste,</HI> a Port-Town of the Emperor's in the <HI>Adriatick-Sea,</HI> and then by Ship to <HI>Venice,</HI> but having been in many Mines be∣fore I had a desire also to see the famous Quick silver Mine at <HI>Idria</HI> in the County of <HI>Goritia;</HI> and parting from <HI>Zirchnitz</HI> I passed by <HI>Lovecq,</HI> and travelled over Mountainous parts till I came to <HI>Idria,</HI> which is en∣compassed with Hills on all sides, and a River of the same name runs by it, which although <HI>Leandro Alberti</HI> terms <HI>superbissimo fiume d'Idria,</HI> yet I found it small and shallow at the time when I was there, upon plentiful rains howsoever it proves sufficient to convey down the Firr∣trees, and other wood required in the building of the Mines, and also
<PB N="82" REF="51"/>
for fuel necessary in the service of them; and to this end there is an handsome work of Piles made slopeing a-thwart the River, (after the same manner as I observed at <HI>Newsol</HI> in upper <HI>Hungary</HI> cross the River <HI>Gran)</HI> to stop the Trees which are cut down and cast into the River above this place.</P>
<P>What is chiefly considerable in this Town are the Quick-silver Mines, very well known to the neighbouring parts, and exceeding useful to many at greater distance.</P>
<P>The entrance into these Mines is not high or upon an Hill, but in the Town it self, whereby they are somewhat the more troubled with water, against which they are provided with many excellent Engines and Devices, as at other deep Mines; the deepest part of the Mine from the entrance is between one hundred and twenty, and one hun∣dred and thirty fathoms.</P>
<P>Of the Quick-silver of this Mine they have two sorts, the one call∣ed <HI>Jungfraw,</HI> that is virgin Quick-silver, the other plain Quick-silver, virgin Mercury they call that which discovers it self without the help of fire, and is either plainly to be seen in the Earth or Ore, or falls down in little drops in the Mine, and sometimes streams out in good quantity; as about seven years ago it ran out of the Earth at first in a stream as small as a thred, and afterwards as big as a Pack-thred, but ceas'd in three or four days.</P>
<P>That also is accounted virgin Quick-silver, which having no need to pass the fire, is separated by water first in a Sieve, and afterwards in a long Trough, having very small holes at one end, so that there is in a manner two sorts of Virgin Mercury; the one running out and dis∣covering it self without labour, the other requiring some way of extra∣ction and separation, though not so high an one as by fire.</P>
<P>Plain Quick-silver they name that which is not at first perceived by the eye, or falls from the Ore, but is forced out by fire, and this they obtain out of the Ore, or out of the natural Cinnabar of Mercury which they dig out of this Mine. The Ore is of a dark colour mixed with red, but the best is a hard Stone which they commit not presently to the fire, but powder it grosly and work it by the sieve, that so if any Virgin Quick-silver be found in it, it may be separated in this manner, and what doth not pass the sieve, may be separated by fire in Iron Fur∣naces, fifty of them in a fire.</P>
<P>The Quick-silver-Ore of this Mine is the richest of all Ores I have yet seen, for ordinarily it contains in it half Quick-silver, and in two parts of Ore one part of Quick-silver, and sometimes in three parts of Ore, two parts of Quick-silver.</P>
<P>I went into the Mine by the Pit of St. <HI>Agatha,</HI> and came up again by that of St. <HI>Barbara,</HI> descending and ascending by Ladders; I ascen∣ded at one of six hundred and thirty nine staves, or eighty nine fa∣thoms. <HI>Siserus</HI> in <HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rcher</HI>'s <HI>Mundus subterraneus</HI> makes such a dread∣ful description of this Mine, that it might discourage any from attempt∣ing the descent, which makes me doubt, whether he had been in any other Mine, especially where the descent is made by Ladders.</P>
<P>In a Laboratory, where the Quick-silver is separated by fire, I saw an heap of sixteen thousand retorts of Iron, every one of which costs a Crown at the best hand from the Iron Furnaces in <HI>Carinthia:</HI> here∣in are also at one time eight hundred retorts, and as many recipients
<PB N="83" REF="51"/>
employed together in drawing over the Quick-silver in sixteen Furna∣ces, fifty in each Furnace, twenty five of a side, twelve above, and thirteen below of each side.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 12. 1669. When I was there they carried out forty saumes of Quick-silver into Foreign parts, each saume containing three hundred and fifteen pound weight to the value of four thousand Ducats of Gold, though the conveyance be not easie, for it is carried upon Horses backs, two small Barrels upon each Horse, yet some is sent as far as <HI>Chremnitz</HI> in <HI>Hungary</HI> for the use of the Gold Mine, and some into <HI>Swe∣den,</HI> and other remote parts.</P>
<P>In the Castle I saw three thousand saumes of Quick-silver together in Barrels▪ the Quick-silver being first made up in double Leather; and in another House as much rich Ore as can be destilled in two years, except they have great plenty of rain to bring down the wood, but the Hills being high about them, it snows at the tops of them oftner than it rains.</P>
<P>Those Strangers who come into the Castle of <HI>Idria,</HI> have their names set down in a Register-Book, with the Country of which they are Na∣tives, and the Catalogue is large, but of <HI>English</HI> men there are few; of late years onely Mr. <HI>Evelyn</HI> and Dr. <HI>Pope,</HI> with their Company, of whose observations there is an handsome account in the Philosophical Transactions some time since. This place is the more grateful to Stran∣gers in respect that it being a Frontier Town, and bordering upon di∣vers Nations, many Languages are understood here, and I observed that there were five spoken freely by the Officers and better sort of People, besides <HI>French</HI> which was not excluded from this place, though not so esteemed or desired. <HI>viz. Friulian, Sclavonian, German, Latin</HI> and <HI>Ita∣lian.</HI></P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Idria</HI> I passed over <HI>Swartzenberg</HI> or the black Mountain, and descended about ten miles through a stony Country far worse than the <HI>Crau</HI> or stony Plain in <HI>Provence,</HI> and came to <HI>Adoshini,</HI> and then to <HI>Go∣ritia</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Goritia.</NOTE> or <HI>Noreja</HI> of old, the chiefest place of the Country of <HI>Goritia,</HI> well seated and over-looking a fair Plain to the South-West. The Empe∣rors Governour of this Country lives in the Castle, and hath had of late a Guard granted unto him, having been set upon by a Gentleman of the Country, who for that fact was banished, and his House rased.</P>
<P>Travelling in the night, we had sometimes about us a great number of large Glow-worms, which put into papers gave a dim light; and in some places in the Plains the Air was full of flaming flies affording some delight to us.</P>
<P>The <HI>Carniolians</HI> speak a Dialect of the <HI>Sclavonian,</HI> but in these parts they have a Language called <HI>Lingua Fullana,</HI> or <HI>Friulana;</HI> he that speaketh <HI>Italian</HI> may understand much thereof. The Lords Prayer in that Language begins thus, <HI>Pari Nestri ch' ees in Cijl see Santificaat tuto nom,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>That neat kind of Acer whereof Violins and Musical Instruments are made, prospers well in these parts, as also in <HI>Carniola</HI> and <HI>Saltzburg∣landt,</HI> where they make Trenchers and Tables of it, and at an easie rate; I brought some of the fair broad Leaves from thence.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Goritia</HI> I passed the River <HI>Sontius</HI> or <HI>Lisonzo</HI> which arising in the Hills above runs into the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea. Near this River, <HI>Odoacer</HI>

who had made himself King of <HI>Italy,</HI> was slain in a Battel by <HI>Theodorick</HI> King of the <HI>Goths.</HI> And hither the <HI>Turks</HI> came under the command of <HI>Asa-Beg</HI> in the year 1477. in the time of <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Great, over∣threw <HI>Jeronimus Novello</HI> Count of <HI>Verona</HI> and a famous Commander of those times, slew him in Battel, together with his Son and most of his Commanders, destroyed a Party of three thousand <HI>Venetians,</HI> and set a hundred Villages on Fire. Afterwards travelling on through Mea∣dows, I came unto the strong and well fortified City of <HI>Palma Nova,</HI> built since to hinder the like incursions.</P>
<P>All this long Circuit until we came within a mile of <HI>Palma Nova</HI> we were in the Emperors Dominions, which are much larger than com∣monly apprehended, and having sooner or later seen the greatest part thereof, I cannot but be of that opinion, for he possesses all <HI>Austria, Styria, Carinthia, Carniola,</HI> part of <HI>Croatia, Istria,</HI> and <HI>Friuli,</HI> part of <HI>Alsatia,</HI> the large County of <HI>Tirolis,</HI> the large Country of <HI>Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia,</HI> and some part of <HI>Lusatia,</HI> and a considerable part of <HI>Hungaria;</HI> from <HI>Presbourg</HI> to <HI>Tockay</HI> and <HI>Zathmar,</HI> above two hun∣dred and fifty miles, and the Inhabitants of these Countries being an hardy stout and valiant People, I cannot but think him a great and powerful Prince, and an happy Bulwark of Christendom against the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Palma Nova.</NOTE> <HI>Palma Nova</HI> in <HI>Friuli</HI> is the largest regular Fortification I have ob∣served, it hath nine Bastions, bearing the names of some noble <HI>Vene∣tians,</HI> which have little to be excepted against but their round ears, on each Curtain there are two Cavalliers, the Rampart is much higher than the Wall, upon which there are planted a hundred good Guns, and many more ready upon all occasions, the Ditch is thirty paces broad, and twelve deep; it is kept dry to render the Town more healthful, but may be filled with water upon occasion, as that of <HI>Vien∣na,</HI> much whereof is kept dry least it should injure their deep Cellars; there are three Gates, <HI>Porta Maritima, Porta di Cividal,</HI> and <HI>Porta di Ʋdine.</HI> Between the <HI>Porta Maritima,</HI> and the <HI>Porta di Ʋdine</HI> lie these three Bastions <HI>Foscarini, Savorgnan</HI> and <HI>Grimani.</HI> Between the <HI>Porta di Ʋdine</HI> and <HI>Porta di Cividal</HI> are three others named <HI>Barbaro, Dona</HI> and <HI>Monte.</HI> And between the <HI>Porta di Cividal</HI> and the <HI>Porta Mariti∣ma</HI> are these three. <HI>Garzoni, Contarini</HI> and <HI>Villa Chiara.</HI> They were then making one fair Half-Moon before each Gate: In the Center of the City is fixed a Standard over a Triple Well, in the middle of a Sexangular <HI>Piazza,</HI> from whence a man may see the three Gates and six Streets quite through the Town. The <HI>Piazza</HI> is beautified with the Front of the <HI>Domo</HI> Church, divers Statues, and an Obelisk much gil∣ded.</P>
<P>In the middle of the Bridge there is a Draw-bridge made with such Artifice, that the sentinel discovering any force approaching, may by onely touching a certain Iron with his foot draw up the Bridge; many handsom contrivances for Draw-bridges I had seen in other parts, sometimes many upon one Bridge, and not onely one after or behind another, but also sometimes two or three on a brest, the outermost ones serving for the retreat of the foot, that in the middle for the Horse and Carriages. Some Draw-bridges are not to lift up, but to be drawn on one side, and so by onely turning of it like to the opening of a Gate Pas∣sengers are conveyed over the Moat and landed; but those which
<PB N="85" REF="52"/>
pleased me most were the Draw-bridges at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> which part in the middle, and a Vessel though under sail may pass them, without the help of any one on shoar, for the Mast, head, or break-water of the Ship▪ bearing against the Bridge in the middle, opens it.</P>
<P>At <HI>Palma Nova</HI> the <HI>Venetians</HI> have made a cut from the Sea to the Town capable of good Vessels, and broad and deep enough to bring pro∣visions and supplies upon occasion to this place.</P>
<P>This is at present esteemed one of the noblest Fortifications in <HI>Europe,</HI> begun by the <HI>Venetians</HI> 1594. and is a notable Bulwark of their State and <HI>Italy,</HI> for this way the <HI>Huns</HI> and barbarous Nations passed into <HI>Ita∣ly,</HI> and this way the <HI>Turks</HI> have formerly made in-roads almost as far as <HI>Treviso.</HI></P>
<P>Having seen many of the chief Fortifications in <HI>Europe,</HI> I had the greater desire to take a view of this, because it carries so great a fame, and is said to have been contrived by Military advice from all parts, and as also because the <HI>Venetians</HI> would have it believed to be the no∣blest Fortification, not onely in <HI>Europe,</HI> but in the World; I heartily wish they may never know a complete <HI>Turkish</HI> Army before it, espe∣cially when ever they are in no good condition to relieve it. If the Emperor, through whose Countries the <HI>Turks</HI> must pass to come to this place, and the Republick hold firm, it will be hard for the <HI>Turk</HI> to come unto it, and if the <HI>Turk</HI> should be at such a peace with the <HI>Vene∣tians</HI> as may bind up their Fleet from assisting the other parts of <HI>Italy,</HI> he shall not need to attempt it or make his way into <HI>Italy</HI> by that place, for whether the Naval Forces of <HI>Italy</HI> without the assistance of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> be able to resist a complete <HI>Turkish</HI> Fleet, so as to hinder landing and falling upon that Country some other way, is much to be doubted.</P>
<P>From <HI>Palma nova</HI> I went to <HI>Maran</HI> St. <HI>Vito,</HI> a Port Town of the <HI>Ve∣netians</HI> in <HI>Friuli,</HI> so named from St. <HI>Vito,</HI> who is said to have been bu∣ried in this place.</P>
<P>At this Town we took a <HI>Felluca,</HI> and sayling by the shoar of <HI>Friuli</HI> or <HI>Patria,</HI> we passed by <HI>Porto di Taiamento,</HI> and came to <HI>Cahorle.</HI> In this Island there is a Church dedicated to the Blessed Virgin seated up∣on the Sea-shoar nigh the Waves, yet said never to be overflowed by the Sea, being as it were the <HI>Halcyon</HI> Nest of its Patroness, and a place of remarkable devotion. On this shoar we refreshed our selves and were divertised at Sea in seeing them take Shell-fish, and then pas∣sing by <HI>Livenza,</HI> where the Sea came formerly up as high as <HI>Opitergium,</HI> and afterwards by <HI>Porto di Piave,</HI> I arrived at <HI>Venice</HI> entring by the <HI>Porto de Castelli</HI> passing by the <HI>Carthusians</HI> Convent, and landed at the <HI>Piazza</HI> of St. <HI>Mark.</HI></P>
<P>Here I found the whole City highly concerned for the <HI>Hazardous</HI> State of <HI>Candia,</HI> which was lost soon after, <HI>Dominico Cantarini</HI> the pre∣sent Duke was sedulous in that affair. The Voyage of <HI>Ghiron Francisco Marchese Villa,</HI> General of the Infantry of <HI>Candia,</HI> with a journal of a Siege had been lately published, and was in many hands.</P>
<P>There was also a supply of Auxiliaries in good readiness; it was at that time a more than ordinary hot Season, and some of our <HI>English</HI> Sea Captains and Masters told me, that they had seldom met with such hot weather even between the <HI>Tropicks.</HI></P>

Having formerly had a view of <HI>Rome, Naples, Florence,</HI> and the great Cities of <HI>Italy,</HI> and passed some time at <HI>Padoa</HI> a few years before, I made but a short stay about Venice, and having reviewed what was most considerable, and renewed my acquaintance with some worthy courteous Friends at <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Padoa,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hales</HI> the Conful, Mr. <HI>Hob∣son,</HI> Dr. <HI>Cadined,</HI> and others. I disposed my affair for my return to <HI>Vienna</HI> the ordinary way.</P>
<P>In order thereto I took Boat at <HI>Venice</HI> and landed at <HI>Mestre</HI> a pret∣ty Town, and the best place for accommodation for such as travel into <HI>Germany</HI> by <HI>Tirol,</HI> or into <HI>Austria</HI> by <HI>Friuli;</HI> from hence I travelled ten miles through a pleasant plain Country till I came to <HI>Treviso</HI> or <HI>Tarvisium,</HI> which gives the name unto the Country about, <HI>La Marca Trevigiana,</HI> a handsome City adorned with good Houses, Churches, Towers and Fountains. The clear River <HI>Sile</HI> or <HI>Silo</HI> runs through it, and afterwards into the Sea between <HI>Mestre</HI> and <HI>Murano;</HI> it aboun∣ds in good Wines and Fruit, and was a chief Seat of the <HI>Lombards</HI> in these parts. This old City, after having run various fortunes and been under the subjection of the <HI>Huns,</HI> and other conquering Nations, and sometimes obeyed the <HI>Signori della Scala,</HI> and the <HI>Carraresi</HI> was united to the State of <HI>Venice</HI> in the year 1388. It was converted to the Christian Faith by <HI>Prosdochimus</HI> a follower of St. <HI>Peter.</HI> Eight miles from hence stood the Ancient City <HI>Altinum</HI> founded by <HI>Antenor,</HI> and de∣stroyed by <HI>Attila.</HI></P>
<P>From thence I came to <HI>Lovadina,</HI> and crossed the great River <HI>Piave, Plavis,</HI> or <HI>Anassus,</HI> which arising in the Mountains, passes by the Ci∣ties of <HI>Belluna</HI> and <HI>Feltre,</HI> then to <HI>Concian</HI> or <HI>Coniglian,</HI> and next to <HI>Sa∣cille</HI> or <HI>Sacillum,</HI> formerly a Bishops See under the Patriarch of <HI>Aquileia,</HI> a pleasant and well-built place esteemed the Garden of the Republick, and seated by the River <HI>Livenza</HI> or <HI>Liquentia,</HI> which passing by <HI>Motta</HI> runs into the Gulf of <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>Here I took a guide to conduct me through the Plains and Mea∣dows, and came to <HI>Spilimbergo,</HI> where I again took a Guide to cross the swift River <HI>Taiamento</HI> or <HI>Tiliaventum;</HI> this is esteemed the greatest Ri∣ver in <HI>Friuli,</HI> arising above in the <HI>Julian Alpes,</HI> and running down into the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea, and often over-flowing a great part of the plain Country. This swift River put a stop to the incursion of the <HI>Turks</HI> when <HI>Scander Bassa</HI> of <HI>Illyria</HI> broke into <HI>Friuli</HI> with twelve thousand Horse and destroyed all before him, in the Reign of <HI>Sultan Bajazet</HI> the Second.</P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Spilimbergo,</HI> I passed a neat River or notable Cut call∣ed <HI>La Brentella,</HI> sixteen miles long, made by the <HI>Venetians</HI> for the bet∣ter bringing down of wood from the Mountains to be used in the making of Glasses at <HI>Muran;</HI> it is all paved with a good Stone, bottom and sides, the bottom is round, so that it is somewhat like a Tube opened or split in two.</P>
<P>Then I passed by St. <HI>Daniel</HI> seated upon an Hill by <HI>Hospitaletto,</HI> and came to <HI>Vensone,</HI> a Town seated at the beginning of the Hills, and formerly the limit of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Dominions; thence by Rejuta to <HI>La Chiusa,</HI> a place remarkable for the streight passage of the Alpes, where the <HI>Venetians</HI> keep a guard, and shut up the passage every night; from thence I came to <HI>Ponteba</HI> or <HI>Ponte Fella</HI> upon the River <HI>Fella,</HI> the ex∣act Confines between the <HI>Venetian</HI> and Imperial Dominions, and
<PB N="87" REF="53"/>
surely a man can seldom pass more clearly and distinctly from one Country unto another than in this Town; on one side of the Bridge live <HI>Italians,</HI> Subjects unto the State of <HI>Venice,</HI> on the other side <HI>Ger∣mans,</HI> Subjects unto the Emperor. Upon the one side their Buildings, their manner of living, their empty Rooms, large Windows, Iron Bed∣steads show them to be <HI>Italians:</HI> On the other side immediately their Stoves, higher Bed-steads, Feather-beds one over another, square Ta∣bles, and their Bason and Cloth by the Wall declare them to be <HI>Ger∣mans;</HI> the Bridge it self is also half <HI>Italian,</HI> half <HI>Dutch,</HI> one part being built of Stone, and the other of great Trees laid over after the <HI>German</HI> fashion of making bridges. Between <HI>Vensone</HI> and <HI>Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teba</HI> there are many great <HI>Cascata's</HI> or falls of waters; but of several passages of the <HI>Alpes</HI> this seemed unto me the best and most easie.</P>
<P>In these Mountainous places I was entertained with strange stories of the Snow which covers these Hills in the Winter, as how many pikes length the Snow was deep in some places, how round the Coun∣try would look when all the craggy Rocks were covered, how a Snow∣ball thrown down from a Mountain would so gather and augment in the fall, as to do great mischief in the Valley, and that if the smallest Bird should but scrape with her foot at the edge of an high Hill, that little beginning might so encrease in the descent, upon a thaugh, as to over-whelm an House at the bottom.</P>
<P>From hence by <HI>Tervis,</HI> and <HI>Tirl,</HI> unto <HI>Villach,</HI> or <HI>Villach,</HI> an hand∣some Town, and one of the chiefest in <HI>Carinthia;</HI> but before I came to <HI>Villach</HI> I went to see the Natural Baths which were not much out of the way at the foot of an Hill about an <HI>English</HI> miles from the Town and in good esteem. There are two clear Sulphureous Baths, but very gent∣ly warm, and have an acid and no unpleasant taste; the bottom is not planchered nor paved, but hath its own natural Spring and Settlement with it; yet into one there is a hot Spring let in which arises by it; they are large and have stairs to descend into them, with little Rooms of wood about them for accommodation, they are covered over, and they bathe in them cloathed with shirt and drawers as in <HI>Austria.</HI></P>
<P>Not far from hence is a Lake called the <HI>Ossiacker See,</HI> from <HI>Ossiack</HI> a Town upon the side thereof, and is one of the most considerable Lakes in <HI>Carinthia,</HI> there being besides it, these which are remarkable, the <HI>White Lake,</HI> the <HI>Millstatter,</HI> the <HI>Word,</HI> and the <HI>Forchten;</HI> this Lake doth not onely abound in Fish, but affords great plenty of <HI>Ossiacker</HI> Nuts, which the people eat, and some make Bread of; which notwith∣standing upon examination I found to be no other than very large Seeds of <HI>Tribulus Aquaticus,</HI> or water <HI>Gallthorps.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Villach</HI> I soon came to the <HI>Werd See,</HI> and keeping it continual∣ly on my right hand, I travelled by the side of it till I came to <HI>Clagenfur∣te,</HI> and then passed again to St. <HI>Veits,</HI> where I met Mr. <HI>Donellan,</HI> from whom, upon my former desires to him, I received an account of the great Lead Mines in upper <HI>Carinthia</HI> at <HI>Bleyberg,</HI> where they have worked eleven hundred years, and the Pits are deep; <HI>Federnus Stollen</HI> or <HI>Cuniculus</HI> is an hundred and ten fathoms deep in the Earth, and the Hills so high about it, that upon the melting of the Snow in the Spring, there is often much hurt done, the Snow rowling and falling in such vast heaps that nothing is able to resist it, so that in the year 1654. it fell so vehemently that it destroyed and carried away sixteen Houses.

He presented me also with many handsome natural Curiosities collect∣ed by him in those parts, one of which among the rest I cannot but mention which was a rich large fair piece of natural <HI>Cinnabar</HI> found in <HI>Crewalt,</HI> or in the Forest of <HI>Cre,</HI> two <HI>German</HI> miles from St. <HI>Veit</HI>'s in the Lordship of <HI>Oosterwitz,</HI> where there hath been great quantities found out, for the <HI>Herr von Staudach</HI> above thirty years ago, as he was hunting in this Forest, being thirsty and laying down to drink out of a little stream which runs from the top of the Hill, he per∣ceived the stream to be full of <HI>Cinnabar,</HI> but since it hath been so dili∣gently searched after, that without working and digging for it, there is little to be found.</P>
<P><HI>From St.</HI> Veitz <HI>I continued my journey by</HI> Friesach, <HI>where formerly there was a Gold Mine, and then by</HI> Newmark, Hundtsmark, Peltsolz, Knïtelfeldt, Luihm, Prug, Keimberg, Mehrz-u-Schlag, Schadtwien, New∣kirckel, Newstadt, Solinaw, Traskirchel, Newdorff, <HI>to</HI> Wien.</P>
<P>This my return from <HI>Venice</HI> to <HI>Vienna,</HI> about three hundred and fif∣ty <HI>Italian</HI> miles, was the most quiet journey I ever made, for not meet∣ing with good Company I performed it alone, and upon one Horse; and although there are several Nations, and no less than four Languages spoken upon this road, yet I met with no disturbance from any, nor did any one ask from whence I came, or whither I would go, no trou∣ble as to Bills of health, and good accommodation in the Inns at an ea∣sie rate, they are for the most part a plain People, make good Souldi∣ers, little mutinous, but obedient to commands, and hardy, and are of good use and service unto the Emperor.</P>
<P>In my travels in <HI>Germany</HI> I seldom failed to meet with <HI>Jews,</HI> but in this journey I met with none, or such as I could not well distinguish, for though there were then whole Villages of <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Austria,</HI> yet they were prohibited in <HI>Styria,</HI> and severely banished out of <HI>Carinthia,</HI> so that for those <HI>Jews</HI> who travelled between <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Vienna;</HI> the Emperor dispences with them as to their Ruff, and the <HI>Venetians</HI> as to their red Hat.</P>
<P>To say any thing of <HI>Vienna</HI> may seem superfluous, divers having written thereof, and it might fall better in, if ever I should describe my journey from the Low Countries to <HI>Vienna,</HI> and from <HI>Vienna</HI> by the way of <HI>Moravia, Bohemia, Misnia, Saxonia</HI> unto <HI>Hamburg;</HI> mean while I would no longer defer to give some account of places less known or less described in <HI>Pannonian, Dacian, Maesian, Graecian, Nori∣cum,</HI> and <HI>Illyrian</HI> Countries, which in their proper order are delivered in this Work.</P>
<P>In my Travels through <HI>Hungaria</HI> and the Imperial Provinces, I could not but take notice of some Assertions which I could not veri∣fie.</P>
<P><HI>Belgrade</HI> is commonly counted to be in <HI>Hungaria,</HI> and so described by some Authors, but if strictly considered it is seated in <HI>Servia,</HI> or <HI>Maesia</HI> Superior, beyond the bounds of <HI>Hungaria.</HI></P>

It is said by <HI>Plinie Cursus Savi</HI> 150. <HI>mille passuum,</HI> that the course of the <HI>Savus</HI> is an hundred and fifty miles, which if accounted from the head is much too short, and not much more then half the measure thereof.</P>
<P>That the River <HI>Savus</HI> runs into the <HI>Dravus,</HI> seems affirmed by <HI>Strabo, Vicinus Nauporto fluvius est Corcoras qui merces accipit, hic in Savum influit, Savus in Dravum,</HI> that is, Not far from <HI>Nauportus</HI> is the River <HI>Corcoras</HI> or the <HI>Gurk</HI> which receives the Merchandises, this runs into the <HI>Savus,</HI> and the <HI>Savus</HI> into the <HI>Dravus,</HI> whereas the <HI>Savus</HI> never runneth into the <HI>Dravus,</HI> and when it enters the <HI>Danube</HI> at <HI>Bel∣grade</HI> is about an hundred miles from it.</P>

<P>I went this Journey when the Sun was in <HI>Cancer,</HI> in the hottest time of the year, and the heat was very offensive to me in the great Plains of <HI>Friuli,</HI> and <HI>Austria;</HI> but in the <HI>Alpes</HI> it was much more moderate, and the Country was all green, and pleasant; when on the contrary all the Grass in <HI>Austria</HI> was burned up by the Sun, and if there were not a continual breeze about the middle of the day upon all great Plains, especially in Southern Countries, the heat would be intolerable; and I could not but take notice how pleasantly the poor Peasants in the <HI>Alpine</HI> Countries divertised themselves in the Fields, and after their la∣bour would be lively and brisk, sometimes play at Cards, with Cards of a span long, such as they have in those Countries, while the rich Country-men in <HI>Austria</HI> were faint and gasping for breath, nor did it any thing avail them that <HI>Austria</HI> was more Northern then <HI>Styria</HI> or <HI>Carinthia,</HI> for there may be as much difference as to the temperature of the Air, and as to heat and cold in one mile, as in ten degrees of Lati∣tude, and he that would cool and refresh himself in the Summer, had better go up to the top of the next Hill, than remove into a far more Northern Country. I have been ready to freeze on the top of a Hill, and in an hours time after have suffered as great inconvenience from the heat of the Valley; at the rising of the Sun I have been upon a Hill with a clear sky, and good weather, and have seen a Valley in∣compassed with Mountains and covered all over with Clouds much be∣low us, the Sun shining upon the upper part of the Clouds made them appear like fine Down or Wooll, and made the softest sweetest lights and shadows imaginable; afterwards when we descended into this Valley under the Clouds we had no such pleasant Prospect, but were rained upon the most part of the day. In that hot Country of <HI>Arabia</HI> Travellers complain most of the cold they suffer in passing the Hills. The Mountains in <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> are some of them covered with Snow

and Ice all the Summer long. I have heard that Mount <HI>Atlas</HI> is so also, from Dr. <HI>Butler</HI> who lately travelled in those parts, and from others; when in Great <HI>Britain</HI> there is no such thing. At <HI>London</HI> we have Winters for the most part favourable, when Captain <HI>James</HI> who went to discover the North-west passage, and to search if there were any communication between the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean and the South Sea in the Northern part of <HI>America,</HI> as there is in the Southern, suffered more hardship in the same degree of Latitude then the nine <HI>English</HI> men who were left all the Winter in <HI>Greenland,</HI> and <HI>Baffin,</HI> on the contrary, upon the same design had a pleasant Voyage in an open Sea, and met with Inhabitants upon the Shoar, till he came within nine degrees of the Pole.

<HEAD>A JOURNEY FROM NORWICH TO COLEN IN GERMANY.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the year 1668. I left the large and pleasant City of <HI>Norwich,</HI> and went by land to <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> a Port Town in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> at the mouth of the River <HI>Hierus</HI> or <HI>Yare;</HI> large, fairly built and populous, very considerable for the great Herring fishing in the Autumn, and the commerce it maintains in the Streights; <HI>Baltick, British</HI> and <HI>German</HI> Seas: With <HI>Italians, French, Spaniards, Dutch, Danes,</HI> and <HI>Swedes.</HI> I was here nobly entertained by that worthy and obliging person, Sir <HI>James Johnson,</HI> who also fur∣nisht me with Letters of Credit, to <HI>Amsterdam, Franckfort, Venice</HI> and <HI>Vienna;</HI> Whereby I was readily and handsomely accommodated in all Parts where I had afterwards occasion to travel.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> the 14. about six a Clock at Night I went aboard the <HI>Angel-Ketch</HI> in <HI>Tarmouth</HI> Road, a Vessel of about 55 Tuns, and we imme∣diately set sayl for <HI>Rotterdam;</HI> we left St. <HI>Nicholas-Sand</HI> on the Lar∣board, and after that the <HI>Nowles,</HI> a new Sand, not taken notice of to be raised above twelve years before. We kept our course all night, East and by South, and East South-East. The Sea burned at the head of the Ship at the beginning of the night, but the Moon rising there appeared nothing but froth. In the morning we discovered <HI>Gravesandt</HI> Steeple. It is the custom upon all this coast to send out Pylot-boats continually to meet all Ships at Sea, and furnish them with Pylots to bring them through the sands, and no Ship is to refuse one: Having taken in our Pylot, we soon discovered <HI>Goréé</HI> Steeple, and then the <HI>Briel.</HI> We entred the River <HI>Mosa,</HI> or <HI>Maes,</HI> a Large and noble Stream,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</NOTE> which arising in the Mountains of <HI>Vauge,</HI> or <HI>Vogesus,</HI> passing by <HI>Ver∣dun,</HI>

The Heads or Keyes between which we entred the Town by water are handsome, and Ships of great burden are received into the middle of divers streets without difficulty, (their Channels being deep and large) the houses are well built, and the Town populous, they have an Exchange or place for Merchants to meet at, the streets are so clean that the Women go about in white Slippers, they being paved with Bricks laid edgewise. The <HI>Landthuise</HI> hath a fair front. In the great Church the Organs, the Tower and the Monument of <HI>De wit;</HI> upon the Bridge the Statue of <HI>Erasmus,</HI> as also the house where he was born, and the Pleasure boats of the States are worth the seeing. It being then the time of their <HI>Kermis</HI> or Fair, there were Playes acted and many rarities shewn, as <HI>Lions, Leopards,</HI> &amp;c. and a great noise was made about a tall Woman to be shewn of seven foot high; but the Boor of <HI>Leckerkir'k,</HI> not far from this Town, was higher. <HI>Parsons</HI> and <HI>Evans,</HI> Porters to King <HI>Charles</HI> the first, did also exceed her, The <HI>Irish</HI> Youth who hath not yet done growing by divers years, shown in ma∣ny places, is already Seven Foot and seven Inches high, but I have sel∣dom heard of any that was taller than <HI>Martin Wierski</HI> a Polander, who at the age of forty two years was presented to the Emperor <HI>Maximi∣lian</HI> the second, as a rarity of nature, and was full eight foot high, whose Picture, as big as the life, I saw, near to the <HI>Franciscans</HI> Convent at <HI>Vienna</HI> in <HI>Austria.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Del<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t.</NOTE> From <HI>Rotterdam</HI> I passed by <HI>Overschee</HI> to <HI>Delft,</HI> by the Powder-house, which is a handsome one, built now at some distance from the Town to prevent the like accident which befel when the former took fire and blew up part of the Town. The <HI>Piazza</HI> or market-place is a very fair one, having the front of the Town house at one end of it, and the high Steeple of the new Church at the other. In the old Church, <HI>Van-Tromps</HI> Tomb is very well carved upon the side of the Wall, him∣self lying upon a Canon encompassed with Arms and trophies.

The <HI>Hague, Haga Comitis,</HI> the ancient place of Residence of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hague.</NOTE> Counts of <HI>Holland,</HI> and now of the States general; is about an hours going distant from <HI>Delft;</HI> in which passage, at some distance, we had a sight of two of the Prince of <HI>Orange's</HI> houses. This place is well built; the Princes Court handsome; The <HI>Piazza</HI> by it full of green Trees; many fair Houses. The Course where the Coaches meet, the Pall-mall, the Wood, the Park, do much beauti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie it, and the way from hence to <HI>Scheveling,</HI> from whence his late Majesty King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second returned into <HI>England,</HI> is very remarkable, it being a streight way cut through the Sand-hills, and paved with Brick for three miles, having on each hand four or five rows of Trees, and <HI>Scheveling</HI> Steeple at the end of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hague</HI> and <HI>Madrid</HI> in <HI>Spain</HI> are accounted the greatest Villa∣ges, or open unwalled places, in <HI>Europe,</HI> and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have thought it more honour to be Masters of the greatest Village, than of a place which, if it were walled, would come short of many Cities; but this may prove a dangerous resolution, for sormerly upon this ad∣vantage, <HI>Martin van Rossem,</HI> Captain to the Duke of <HI>Gueldres,</HI> sacked the <HI>Hague;</HI> and it was lately in the like danger when the <HI>French</HI> Forces lay at <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> and <HI>Worden,</HI> if they had forced a passage into that part of <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Leyden</HI> is three hours or three <HI>Dutch</HI> miles from the <HI>Hague,</HI> at pre∣sent<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leyden.</NOTE> one of the neatest Towns in <HI>Europe;</HI> Well built, hath divers large Streets, beautified with rows of Trees, and the water passing through the middle of them, and also well fortified after the modern way; I took notice of that Antiquity called <HI>Hengist</HI> Castle, or the <HI>Berg,</HI> said to be built by <HI>Hengist</HI> the <HI>Saxon,</HI> and went up to the top thereof: Up∣on the top there is now an Arbour, and a Maze or Labyrinth round it, and a Well, out of which, they told us, they took a Fish alive when the Town was almost famished during the Siege, which was shewed to the Enemy over the Wall, endeavouring to make their condition to appear better than it was, and to dishearten the besiegers. There are now handsome stairs from the top to the bottom, and a good house built by it, where they have their publick sales and entertainments. But a nobler Antiquity lies under the Sea, than any above ground; not far from hence near <HI>Catwyck</HI> is a square fortress called <HI>Arx Britan∣nica,</HI> built by <HI>Caligula;</HI> in the declining of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire ruined in part by the <HI>Normans,</HI> and afterwards neglected, and overwhelmed by the Sea. But in some years, and great retire of the Sea, the ruines have been discovered, and many noble Antiquities brought from it, some having this inscription <HI>Ex. Ger.

I saw also here what Mon∣sieur <HI>de Bils</HI> pretended towards the preservation of Bodies, but more accurately afterwards at Dr. <HI>Ruisch</HI> his house at <HI>Amsterdam.</HI> The Phy∣sick-garden, although but small, is well filled with Plants, where are also many other both natural, and artificial Curiosities to be seen, and many sorts of <HI>Optick-glasses.</HI> Near the garden are the Schools built of
<PB N="94" REF="57"/>
Brick with the <HI>Officina Elzeviriana</HI> on the top. In the Churches I saw the Monuments of many famous men, in the <HI>French</HI> Church is the Tomb of <HI>Joseph Scaliger,</HI> with a large Inscription upon it, and these few words which he himself desired might be placed there.</P>
<LG>
<L>Josephus Justus Scaliger</L>

<P>As also the Tomb of <HI>Carolus Clusius</HI> the great Herbarist.</P>

<Q><L><HI>Clusius</HI> view'd all the Plants that this Earth yields,</L>

<P>There is a Picture in the Chamber for the Burgermasters, repre∣senting the day of Judgment, drawn by <HI>Lucas van Leyden,</HI> so much esteemed that, it is said, the Emperor <HI>Rudolphus</HI> would have gi∣ven for it as many Ducats of Gold as would have covered it. The Table also upon which <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Leyden</HI> wrought whilst he was a Tay∣lor, is a Curiosity, because he proved afterwards so considerable a di∣sturber of <HI>Germany,</HI> and came to be King of the <HI>Anabaptists.</HI></P>
<P>This City endured a hard siege by the <HI>Spanish</HI> forces, and they were reduced unto great extremity, but they saved themselves by overflow∣ing the Country, and so forcing the enemies to make away with great loss; and afterwards coyned a memorial-Medal with this in∣scrption.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Haerlem.</NOTE> From <HI>Leyden</HI> I came to <HI>Haerlem,</HI> a neat City, pleasantly seated and having a Grove near it. The great Church is esteemed the largest in <HI>Holland,</HI> with a very high Lanthorn upon it. Within are many In∣scriptions and Monuments, most of which are transcribed and set down in <HI>Gotfr. Hegenitii Itinerarium Hollandicum.</HI> In the Prince's house are all the Earls of <HI>Holland</HI> Painted upon the wall, and in the Garden in the Summer-house, the Picture of <HI>Laurentius Costerus,</HI> who is said to have first invented the art of Printing in this Town; but others attri∣bute it to <HI>Johannes Gottenberg,</HI> a <HI>German.</HI> On the other side there is a Picture of a Ship with Saws, in memory of the manner how <HI>Damiata</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI> was formerly taken by those of this Town, who, as they re∣port, accompanied <HI>Frederick Barbarossa</HI> in an expedition against the <HI>Saracens,</HI> and when the men of <HI>Pelusium</HI> or <HI>Damiata</HI> had chained up their Port, by this invention of fastning strong Saws to the keels of their
<PB N="95" REF="57"/>
Ships, they cut the chains in sunder, and so took the Town. In the rooms are very good Paintings by <HI>Hemskerk,</HI> and <HI>Goltzius,</HI> as his <HI>Pro∣metheus</HI> and other Peeces; but <HI>Cornelius van Haerlem</HI> most delighted me, in his peeces of <HI>Herods</HI> killing the Innocent Children; his feast of the Gods, in which <HI>Vulcans foot</HI> is esteemed at a great rate; and ano∣ther Picture of a Frier and a Nun at a Collation, not inferiour to the rest, among many Epitaphs in the great Church, there is this <HI>Dutch</HI> one, for a Man and his Wife.</P>

<P>The old Mens house, or an Hospital for sixty aged persons, is large and handsome; having a good Quadrangle and a Garden in it. The Hospital also for the sick is very cleanly kept.</P>
<P>Here I first saw the manner of punishing Malefactors by whipping them with rods, which is more severe than I imagined; they lead them to a Post upon a Scaffold, their hands tyed and by a Pully drawn up as high as can be extended, and then an Iron fastned about their wast to keep them steady; in which stretched-out posture they receive some∣times fifty or sixty stripes or more, according to the merit of their of∣fence.</P>
<P>Not far from this place there is a great Water, or noted Lake called <HI>Haerlem Meere</HI> about twenty Miles in length, which is frozen over in hard Winters, and men swiftly travel over it by sliding or in sleds. When <HI>Haerlem</HI> was besieged there was a Naval fight upon it; The <HI>Dutch</HI> having about an hundred and fifty Vessels, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> not many fewer. The Town was afterwards taken by Composition, but such Cruelty was used by tho <HI>Spaniards</HI> that they have not yet forgot it <NOTE PLACE="marg">Amsterdam.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From <HI>Haerlem</HI> I went to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> a City at present for Riches, Trade, Shipping, fair Streets, and pleasant habitations, scarce yielding to any other of the World. It is seated upon the River <HI>Ye,</HI> and hath its name, as 'tis reported, from a Castle appertaining long since to the Lords of <HI>Amstel,</HI> to whom this place also belonged: At the begin∣ning, the seat of a few Fishermen; but afterwards increasing, it re∣ceived many Priviledges from the Counts of <HI>Holland,</HI> and was made a Town or City by the favour of their Grants and Charters. In the year 1470. it was walled about with a Brick-wall, to defend it against the Citizens of <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> they having been in great danger to have fallen in∣to their hands, if those of <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> had pursued their Victories. In few Months after also, the whole Town was almost reduced to Ashes by fire, but by the increase of their Traffick they easily overcame their losses, waded through all difficulties, and rendred good Services to their Counts, and received the honour afterwards from <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Emperor to have the Imperial Crown over their Armes, which ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> three <HI>Crosses</HI> on a <HI>Pale.</HI></P>
<P>About the year 1525. <HI>Gelen,</HI> sent from the new King of <HI>Munster,</HI> passed through <HI>Friesland</HI> and came to this City; where having made a
<PB N="96" REF="58"/>
Party, and communicated his design, he resolved to surprize the Town by night, at the time of the sounding of the Bell; to which intent they were already entred the Market place, had set upon the Town∣house: and cut in pieces those who resisted them. When by great providence the rope to the great Bell was taken away; the Magi∣strates had notice of it, and caused all the Streets and Avenues leading to the Market-place to be stopped up with Wool-sacks and Hop-sacks, whereby they were hindred in their design of taking the Town by night, and the next morning their number being discovered to be in∣considerable, they were set upon, driven into the <HI>Stadthuis,</HI> and de∣feated.</P>
<P>Of late years this City is mightily encreased and encompassed with a new Wall, and fortified after the modern way. The new Streets are large and uniform: and the whole Town being in a low Marshy ground, the water is let in through all the considerable Streets. The River <HI>Amstel</HI> passes through the City, being let in under a handsome well contrived Bridge of Eleven Arches, which is so built as to make part of the Wall and Rampart, and is 26 paces broad. The whole Town is built upon Piles, or high Firr-trees, driven down perpendicu∣larly into the Earth so thick together, that nothing more can be forced in between them: And by this means they build Houses in the Sea, and lay Foundations strong enough to support the geatest Buildings whatsoever, in places where no solid bottom is to be found. But they must needs be at a great expence and labour before they can lay the first Stone: And the number of Trees required to each Foundation is considerable; since for the Foundation of one Tower or Steeple alone, over against the Church of St. <HI>Katherine,</HI> Mr. <HI>J. de Parivall,</HI> who wrote <HI>Les Delices de la Hollande,</HI> reckons that there was rammed into the ground a <HI>Forest,</HI> as he calls it, of Six thousand three hundred and thirty four great Trees. About this manner of work, for the fix∣ing their Foundations, I saw them employed in divers places, parti∣cularly at the <HI>East-India-house</HI> and at a place where a <HI>Lutheran</HI> Church was then designed to be built, So that it was not improbably said, <HI>That if a man could see all under this City, he could hardly behold a greater Forest.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Stadthuis</HI> or <HI>Town-house,</HI> is the noblest Building in all these Countries. A Pile of Freestone of an hundred and ten paces in Front, being larger than the Magnified Front of the Church of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s at <HI>Rome,</HI> and eighty one paces deep, or on the sides. The Chambers in it, the Pictures and Statues, are worthy to be seen and admired. The first Room on the right hand, or <HI>Judgment-hall,</HI> where the Malefactors receive their Sentence, is adorned with large Statues, hanging down their heads in mournful postures, as if concerned or grieving at what was then pronounced. The Floors are of Marble; the Roofs are rich∣ly gilt and painted. Upon the top of all stands <HI>Atlas</HI> or <HI>Columbus,</HI> holding a Globe upon his Shoulder made of Copper, of about ten foot Diameter, which is as large perhaps as any Ball or Globe whatsoever employed to this ornamental use. That upon St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s at <HI>Rome,</HI> as having been in it, I judge to be less; as likewise that at <HI>Florence.</HI> The <HI>Turkish</HI> Ornament to the Tower of their <HI>Mosques,</HI> is three Balls one above another, and an half Moon over them, but they are less by far, at least such as I have seen: and by relation from Eye-witnesses, the
<PB N="97" REF="58"/>
largest of the three noble gilded Balls at <HI>Morocco</HI> are inferiour to this. But I will say nothing more of this great building, the <HI>Stadthuis,</HI> since there is a peculiar description of it in Folio, with Cuts and Figures of the most remarkable Curiosities in it. The <HI>Exchange</HI> is fair and large, and above it are Shops: it is very well frequented, and he that comes after twelve payeth six stivers.</P>
<P>Divers of their Churches are fair: In the new Church, the partition with Ballisters of Brass, and the carved Pulpit, are noble. In the old Church the Tomb of <HI>Van H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lse</HI> and <HI>Heemskerk</HI> are remarkable. <HI>Heemskerk</HI> did his Country great Services in their first attempts upon <HI>India:</HI> for the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> having confiscated some of the <HI>Hollan∣ders</HI> Ships, who traded to his Dominions, which were then the Staple for the <HI>India</HI> Trade, It was resolved by the permission of Prince <HI>Mau∣rice</HI> and the States, to set out a Fle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of eight Ships for the <HI>Indies;</HI> four of which were to pass by the way of the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, and the Cape of <HI>Good-hope:</HI> And the other four were to search a passage towards the Kingdoms of <HI>Cathay</HI> and <HI>China</HI> by the North-east, whereby the passage also into those parts might be expected much shorter than that which was known to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>To this intent these four last vessels sailed out of the <HI>Texel. June</HI> 5. 1594. and returned in <HI>September,</HI> not being able to proceed by reason of the Ice. But upon the relation of the Voyage by <HI>William Barenson,</HI> there were two other Expeditions afterwards to <HI>Nova Zembla;</HI> in the last of which they wintered there, and <HI>Barenson</HI> lost his life. <HI>Heems∣kerk</HI> was the chief of the twelve which returned from that cold habita∣tion, where none but Bears and Foxes could well endure the Winter, where he had been twice, and afterwards made two rich Voyages into <HI>India.</HI> Upon whose happy returns the <HI>Holland East India</HI> Company was first established, and a prohibition m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de for any other of that Coun∣try to trade thither for the space of One and twenty years.</P>
<P>But to proceed to other publick Buildings in this City. The <HI>Tuch∣thuis</HI> or <HI>Raspelhuis,</HI> or House of Correction for debauched young men, such as are incorrigible and disobedient to Parents or Laws, hath at the entrance of the Gate two Lions bridled, a proper Emblem, with this Inscription, <HI>Virtutis est domare quae cuncti pavent.</HI> This was formerly a Monastery belonging to the Nuns of the Order of St. <HI>Clare,</HI> and con∣verted to this use 1595. They who are put in, are forced to work and gain their Bread with hard labour. I saw those who rasped <HI>Brazil,</HI> having a certain task set them every day, work so hard, that being naked and in a sweat, and the dust of the <HI>Brazil</HI> wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d flying upon them, they were all over painted of a beautiful red colour. Which odd sight made me call to mind the Fancy of my Lady Marchioness of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> of a Nation wherein the People were of Orange-tawny co∣lour, and the King of Purple.</P>
<P>They told us that some that were committed to their charge, and not to be brought to work by blows, they placed in a large Cistern, and let the water in upon them, placing only a Pump by them for their relief, whereby they are forced to labour for their lives, and to free themselves from drowning. One we saw put into a narrow Dungeon, and kept from meat. Some are put into this House for a longer time, some for a shorter. It hath been a punishment for such as have drawn their Daggers, or offered to stab any one. And some Citizens, though
<PB N="98" REF="59"/>
able and rich enough, contrive it so, that when their Sons are extrava∣gant and masterless, the Officers seize upon them, and carry them into this House, where they are not forced to any hard labour, but kept in till they see sufficient signs of amending their life.</P>
<P>This way of Correction may seem severe to many, yet is not com∣parable to that which is said to have been formerly used in <HI>Germany.</HI> Particularly at <HI>Colen,</HI> in the <HI>White Tower,</HI> at the North end of the Town, near the <HI>Rhine;</HI> where it is reported, that such Youths, who were not otherwise to be reclaimed, were in a barbarous manner shut up in the <HI>White Tower.</HI> The height and thickness of the Walls secured them from escaping, or from their complaints being heard. Near the top was placed out of their reach a loaf of bread, the last remedy against star∣ving, which while their bold necessity forced them to reach at, they exe∣cuted their last sentence upon themselves, and miserably brake their own necks.</P>
<P>Somewhat like the <HI>Raspelhuis</HI> is the <HI>Spinbuis,</HI> or House of Correcti∣on, for the young women, who live loosely, are taken in the night, or can give no account of their living. They are put in for a certain time, according as their fault merits, and are bound to make lace, sew, or employ their time perpetually in some honest labour.</P>
<P>Those of the better sort are permitted to have Chambers apart. In one large Room I saw about an hundred of them, and some very well dressed and fine, which was an unexpected sight to me, and would sure be more strange to behold in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Weeshuis,</HI> or Hospital for Children, where there are Six hun∣dred Orphans carefully looked after, and well educated.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dolhuis,</HI> or a House for such as are Delirious, Maniacal, or Me∣lancholical of both Sexes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gasthuis,</HI> or Hospital for the Sick, being large, and hath a great Revenue.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mannenhuis,</HI> or Hospital for old Men, and such as are no longer able to labour towards their own support.</P>
<P>Besides all which, there are great Sums of money collected for the poor, so that there is not a Beggar to be seen in the Streets, and upon all assignations or appointments of meeting at the Tavern, or elsewhere, and upon many other occasions, whosoever fails to come at the exact time, forfeits more or less to the use of the Poor.</P>
<P>The <HI>East-India-houses</HI> are remarkable, and the great Stores of their Commodities, <HI>Cinnamon, Green-ginger, Camphire, Pepper, Calecuts, Indi∣co,</HI> &amp;c. The Ships are of a great burden: their House was then en∣larging, although it was great before; and a perfect Town for all Trades within it self.</P>
<P>The <HI>Admiralteyt,</HI> or Admiralty where their Stores for War and Shipping are laid up, is encompassed with water; near to it there lay then 72 Men of War. In the House we saw their Cables, Grapling∣irons, Pullies, Oars, Charges for Powder, Lanthorns for Ships, &amp;c. At the entrance of the Gate hangs up a <HI>Canoe</HI> which seems to have a man in it, dryed up, so as to be preserved from corruption, and a Paddle in his hand: enclosed up to the wast in the <HI>Canoe,</HI> in such sort, as the Fish-skins, which were the cover to it, being so sewed together that no water could get in, he might keep the Sea in the greatest Storms without danger. The top of this House, as of divers others also in this
<PB N="99" REF="59"/>
City, is a Reservatory for Rain-water, which they have the more need of, because they have little good water hereabouts.</P>
<P>The fairest Streets in the Town are <HI>Harlem-street,</HI> the <HI>Cingel, Prin∣ces Graft, Kaisers Graft,</HI> and the New Buildings in the Island towards <HI>Gottenburg.</HI> And if they continue to build with Freestone, they will still surpass these, which, I'll assure you, are in no small measure beau∣tiful.</P>
<P>I saw a Globe to be sold, made by <HI>Vingbomes,</HI> between six and seven foot Diameter, valued at Sixteen thousand Guldens: The Meridian a∣lone, being of brass, cost a thousand Guldens. The Globe is made of Copper-plates excellently well painted, with all the new Discoveries in it, as that of <HI>Anthony Van Dimons</HI> Land, found out 1642. in 42 degrees of Southern Latitude, and 170 of Longitude, those towards the North-west of <HI>Japan,</HI> and those places both about <HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> and also in the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Sea beyond the Streights of <HI>Voygats, New-Holland, West-Friesland, Cape d' Hyver,</HI> &amp;c. but I have since met with a Book, which doth somewhat contradict this; entituled <HI>A Voyage into the Northern Countries by Monsieur</HI> Martiniere, who went in one of the three Ships belonging to the Northern Company of <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> in the year 1653. and by that means had occasion to converse with the <HI>Norwegians, Islan∣ders, Laplanders, Kilops, Borandians, Siberians, Zemblians,</HI> and <HI>Samo∣jedes,</HI> who are Neighbours to the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Tingorses,</HI> in his 46 Chap∣ter he expresses himself after this manner. There having fallen into my hands several Geographical Charts of sundry eminent and much celebrated Authors, I am much amazed to see how they are mistaken in the position of <HI>Zembla,</HI> which they place much nearer the North Pole than really it is; they divide it likewise by the Sea from <HI>Green∣land,</HI> and place it far distant from it, when as indeed those two Coun∣tries are Contiguous, the Coasts of <HI>Greenland</HI> butting upon the Coasts of <HI>Zembla,</HI> so as did not the great quantity of Snow, and the violence of the cold render those Borders uninhabitable, the passage would be very easie by Land from <HI>Greenland</HI> to <HI>Zembla</HI> and from <HI>Zembla</HI> passing the <HI>Pater-noster</HI> Mountains to enter into <HI>Samojedia,</HI> from thence into <HI>Tartary</HI> or <HI>Muscovy,</HI> as one pleased: I was amazed likewise to see they had described the Streight called <HI>Voygat,</HI> not above ten French Leagues in length, whereas it contains above five and thirty Dutch Leagues, which is six times as much. Again, they would perswade us that through that Streight our ships might pass into the great <HI>Tartarian</HI> Ocean, which is a mistake. And although they indeed do affirm that in the time of Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> of <HI>Nassaw,</HI> a Dutch Vessel passed that way into that Ocean, yet it is a manifest error, that Streight being bounded, as I said before, by the <HI>Pater-noster</HI> Mountains, which are half a League high, and the tops of them covered with perpetual Snow, which never dissolves. And of this I can give a positive testimony, ha∣ving been my self in that Streight under those Mountains in the Dog∣days, which is the hottest time of the year.</P>
<P>From the Steeple of the old Church of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> I had a good Prospect of the Town, and the great number of Ships lying upon one side of it, like a Wood; and all the Towns about it. The Roofs of the Houses being sharp, it is a most uneven Town to be looked upon down∣ward, as it is a handsome one to be looked on upward; and is not so diver∣tising or pleasing to the sight, as some Towns in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> which
<PB N="100" REF="60"/>
have flatter Roofs, or else are covered with a fine black Slat or Ardoise. Upon this, and all other Towers of the Town, a Trumpet is sounded at Midnight, and in other parts of the City at six a Clock night and morning. At eleven a Clock, the time of going on to the <HI>Exchange,</HI> there is good Musick at the <HI>Stadthuis,</HI> given by the Earl of <HI>Leicester.</HI> They make good Harmony also every hour in playing upon their Chimes and Bells in most Steeples. And there is a Musick-house or Entertaining-house, where any one is admitted for a Stiver, hears most sorts of Musick, sees many good Water-works, and divers motions by Clock-work, Pictures, and other Divertisements.</P>
<P>During my stay at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> I had the opportunity of seeing di∣vers Learned Men, and Persons of Note. Dr. <HI>Ruish</HI> shewed us many Curiosities in Anatomy, as the <HI>Skeletons</HI> of young Children, and <HI>Faetus's</HI> of all Ages, neatly set together, and very white; the <HI>Lymphatick ves∣sels</HI> so preserved, as to see the <HI>valves</HI> in them. A Liver excarnated, showing the Minute vessels, all shining and clear. The Muscles of Chil∣dren dissected and kept from corruption: entire Bodies preserved; the face of one was very remarkable, without the least spot or change of colour or alteration of the lineaments, from what might be expected immediately after death: he had then kept it two years, and hoped it would so continue. Dr. <HI>Swammerdam</HI> shewed us divers of his Ex∣periments which he hath set down in his Treatise <HI>De Respiratione;</HI> and a very sair Collection of Insects brought from several Countries; a <HI>Stagg-fly</HI> of a very great bigness; an <HI>Indian Scolopendria,</HI> or <HI>Forty-foot;</HI> a fly called <HI>Ephemeron,</HI> and many other Curiosities. Old <HI>Glawber</HI> the Chymist shewed us his Laboratory: And we received much civility from <HI>Blasius</HI> the Physick Professour who hath wrote a Comment upon <HI>Veslingius.</HI></P>
<P>The Jews live more handsomly and splendidly here, than in any other place: Their chief Synagogue is large, adorned with Lamps of Brass and Silver. We happened to be there at the Feast of their <HI>New∣year;</HI> so that there blowing of Horns, shouting and singing was not omitted: Some of them understand divers Languages. I saw one <HI>Moses di Pas,</HI> a Learned young Man, and <HI>Orobio,</HI> a Physician of Note. And I was sorry to see divers here to profess themselves publickly Jews, who had lived at least reputed Christians, for a long time in other places: One who had been a <HI>Franciscan</HI> Friar thirty years; and ano∣ther who had been Professour some years at <HI>Tholouze,</HI> and before that Physician to the King of <HI>Spain. Juda Leo,</HI> a Jew, hath taken great pains in making a Model of the Temple of <HI>Solomon,</HI> of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s House, the Fort of the Temple, the Tabernacle, the Israelites encamping, and other Curiosities. I was present at the Circumcision of a Child; which is performed by thrusting a Probe in between the <HI>Glans</HI> and <HI>Praeputi∣um,</HI> and separating it, or dilating the <HI>Praeputium,</HI> so as the inward Skin may be drawn forward as well as the outward; then by applying an Instrument joynted like a Carpenters Rule, or a Sector, the Skin is held fast beyond the <HI>Glans,</HI> and with a broad Incision-knife, or Cir∣cumcision-knife, the Foreskin is cut off close to the Instrument; and what remains of Skin is immediately put back, the blood stopped with Powders, and a Plaister applyed; the Relations and Acquain∣tance singing all the while, whereby the cries of the Infant are less heard.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="60"/>
Leaving <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> I passed by a peculiar Burial-place of the Jews, who are not permitted to interr their dead within the Walls▪ by <HI>Overs∣kerk, Bamburg,</HI> and in six or seven hours arrived at <HI>Ʋtretcht,</HI> in a Boat drawn with Horses through artificial Cuts of Water, which is the way of Travelling in <HI>Holland, Ʋtretcht,</HI> and divers other Provinces of the <HI>Low-Countries.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> is an ancient, large, handsome City, and chief of the Pro∣vince<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ʋtrecht.</NOTE> of the same name, called formerly <HI>Antonina,</HI> and afterwards <HI>Ʋl∣trajectum.</HI> Long famous for its Episcopal See founded by <HI>Dagobert,</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> who endowed it richly with Lands and Possessions: <HI>Willebald,</HI> or <HI>Willebrode,</HI> an Englishman, was their first Bishop, who converted these Countries unto Christianity; and the following Bi∣shops grew so powerful, that they were able to bring many thousand men into the field, and to wage great Wars against the Counts of <HI>Hol∣land:</HI> Their Succession also continued for above Nine hundred years. It is now an University, founded by the States in the Year 1639. I shall not trouble you with the Names of the Professors; the Learned Mr. <HI>Ray,</HI> whom I had the honour to meet in divers places abroad, having already caused to be printed the <HI>Series Lectionum</HI> of this and many o∣ther Universities in the <HI>Low-Countries, Germany,</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> in his <HI>Ob∣servations Topographical, Moral, Physiological,</HI> set forth 1673. The great Church hath a very high Tower, or three Steeples one above ano∣ther: From the highest of which I had not only a good sight of the Town it self, which lay under mine Eye like a Platform, but of many others also; <HI>Ʋtretcht</HI> being in a plain slat Country, and so well seated, and encompassed with so populous a Country, that in a days Journey a man may go from hence to any one of fifty walled Towns and Ci∣ties. The <HI>English</HI> Church here is an ancient Building; the Pillar in the middle of it, whose Foundation could not be laid but upon Bulls∣hides, is much taken notice of: It was built 1099. and hath the Picture of a Bull upon it with this Inscription;
<Q><L>Accipe Posteritas quod per tua saecula narres,</L>
<L>Taurinis cutibus fundo solidata columna est.</L></Q></P>
<P>There is an old Library belonging to this Church, which contains divers old Books and Manuscripts. A large Bille in six Volumes, painted and gilded after a very ancient manner: Two Idols, taken (in time of War) long since in <HI>Germany,</HI> and given to this place by the Emperor <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, are worth the seeing, not so much for their neatness, as their Antiquity and odd shape: As also a Horn made out of a Tooth, said to be given at the same time. There are also three <HI>Ʋnicorns</HI> Horns, little differing in length; the longest being five foot and an half: I drank out of one of them, the end being tipp'd with Silver, and made hollow to serve for a Cup. These were of the <HI>Sea-Ʋnicorn,</HI> or the Horn or long wreathed Tooth of some Sea-Animal much like it, taken in the Northern Sea; of which I have seen many, both in Publick Repositories, and in Private Hands. Two such as these, the one Ten foot long, were presented not many years since to the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> being taken near to <HI>Nova Zembla;</HI> and I have seen some full fifteen foot long; some wreathed very thick, some not so much, and others almost plain: Some largest and thickest at the
<PB N="102" REF="61"/>
End near the head; others are largest at some distance from the Head: Some very sharp at the end or point, and others blunt. My honoured Father Sir <HI>Thomas Brown</HI> had a very fair piece of one which was for∣merly among the Duke of <HI>Curland</HI>'s Rarities, but after that he was ta∣ken Prisoner by <HI>Douglas</HI> in the Wars between <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Poland,</HI> it came into the hands of my Unckle Colonel <HI>Hatcher,</HI> of whom my Fa∣ther had it, he had also a piece of this sort of <HI>Ʋnicorns</HI> Horn burnt black, out of the Emperor of <HI>Russia</HI>'s <HI>Repositorie,</HI> given him by Dr. <HI>Ar∣thur Dee,</HI> who was Son to Dr. <HI>John Dee,</HI> and also Physician to the Emperor of <HI>Russia,</HI> when his Chambers were burned, in which he pre∣served his Curiosities. I have seen a walking Staff, a Scepter, a Scab∣bard for a Sword, Boxes, and other Curiosities made out of this Horn, but was never so fortunate as from experience to confirm its Medical Efficacy against I oisons, contagious Diseases, or any other evident ef∣fect of it, although I have known it given several times, and in great quantity, Mr. <HI>Charlton</HI> hath a good <HI>Ʋnicorns</HI> Horn, Sir <HI>Joseph William∣son</HI> gave one of them to the Royal Society. The Duke of <HI>Florence</HI> hath a fair one. The Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> a strange one, and besides many o∣thers, I saw eight of them together upon one Table in the Emperors treasure, and I have one at present that for the neat wreathing and Elegant shape gives place to none. But of these <HI>Ʋnicorns</HI> Horns no man sure hath so great a Collection as the King of <HI>Denmark;</HI> and his Father had so many, that he was able to spare a great number of them, to build a Magnificent Throne out of <HI>Ʋnicorns</HI> Horns.</P>
<P>I had the honour to see divers Persons of Note in this City; as <HI>D. Cy∣prianus ab Oesterga,</HI> Dr. <HI>Regius, Voetius,</HI> the only Member then left alive of the Synod of <HI>Dort</HI> and others; but missed the sight of the learn∣ed <HI>Anna Maria Skurman,</HI> who was then gone out of Town, and was forced to content my self with beholding her Picture, well drawn by her own hand, with this Inscription of hers under it:
<Q><L>Cernitis hic picta nostros in Imagine vultus,</L>
<L>Si negat a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sformam gratia vestra dabit.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Painters Hall is considerable, wherein are many good pieces to be seen of several Masters: Amongst which there are good Heads by <HI>Van Colen</HI> and <HI>Tuart;</HI> Land-skips by <HI>Soft-lever;</HI> and good Drapery, espe∣cially in some Turkish Habits, by <HI>Vander Mere.</HI></P>
<P>This Town is also beautified with a fair Piazza or Market-place, di∣vers long Streets, and a <HI>Pall-mall</HI> with five rows of Trees on each side. In the Church of St. <HI>Katherine</HI> is the Tomb of my Lord <HI>Gorge.</HI> Though I had seen <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> and the Noble Cities thereof, which are worthily admired by all, yet I was much surprized upon the first sight of the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces,</HI> especially of <HI>Holland,</HI> and the ad∣joyning places. He that hath observed the easie accomodation for Tra∣vel therein, both by Land and Water, their excellent order and regular course in all things; the number of Learned Men: the abundance of Varieties in all kinds; the industry, frugality and wealth of the Peo∣ple; their numerous good Towns; their extraordinary neatness in their Buildings and Houses; their proper Laws and administration of Justice; and their incredible number of Shipping and Boats, will think it an omission to rest in the fight of other Countries without a view of
<PB N="103" REF="61"/>
this. A Country of little extent, and soon travelled over, but so re∣plenished with People, with good Cities, fair Towns and Villages, as not to be met with upon so little a compass of ground, except perhaps in <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Ʋtrecht,</HI> in two hours, I came to <HI>Friswick,</HI> and passed over the River <HI>Leck</HI> to <HI>Vianen,</HI> where there is little remarkable besides the House and Gardens of Count <HI>Brederode,</HI> one of the Ancient Nobility of <HI>Holland,</HI> or according to common esteem, of the most Noble Family of all; the Family of the <HI>Egmonds</HI> being formerly esteemed the Rich∣est; the <HI>Wassenaer</HI>'s the most ancient, and the <HI>Brederodes</HI> the Noblest. The Mount in this Garden serves for the Rampart to the Town, and on a round <HI>Bullwark</HI> are divers small brass Guns planted. The Statua's of the twelve <HI>Caesars,</HI> of <HI>Aristotle,</HI> the Pyramids and Partitions, with the Paintings upon the wall, are the rest of its Ornaments.</P>
<P>From hence I passed still by Boat through the Land of <HI>Arkel,</HI> some say, derived from <HI>Hercules;</HI> belonging formerly to the Lords of <HI>Gor∣chom</HI> and <HI>Arkeland,</HI> till by <HI>Mary,</HI> daughter to the last Lord of <HI>Arkeland,</HI> it fell to <HI>John</HI> Lord of <HI>Egmond,</HI> and was afterwards sold to <HI>William,</HI> the sixth Earl of <HI>Holland.</HI> I arrived this night at <HI>Gorchom,</HI> a Town well seated, near three Rivers, the <HI>Ling,</HI> the <HI>Wael▪</HI> and the <HI>Maes.</HI> The Market-place is fair; the <HI>Stadthuis</HI> is sunk somewhat on one side. The Governour hath a good House, and the Church a very high thick Steeple: the Works are of Earth: the Water-gate is handsome, and over it in Great Letters in this inscription;
<Q><L>Civitas in quâ maximè Cives legibus parent, &amp; in pace beata, &amp; bello invicta. <HI>1642.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>The more remarkable because it made good its Inscription in the year 1672. When <HI>Louis</HI> the Fourteenth, King of <HI>France,</HI> came down with so powerful an Army into the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> that in that Sum∣mers Expedition he took thirty walled Towns and Cities, this Wa∣tergate being the Limit to his Conquests this way, beyond which his Forces were not able to attempt any thing.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Gorcum,</HI> I passed by <HI>Worcum,</HI> on the other side of the River, and then by the Castle of <HI>Lovestein,</HI> strongly seated and well fortified; and therefore hath been often made use of to secure Persons of Note. Sir <HI>George Ascue</HI> of late years suffered his Imprisonment herein, and formerly <HI>Barnevelt;</HI> upon which occasion this Castle hath been much spoken of, and hath given the name to that whole party who sided with him, well known at present by the name of the <HI>Lovestein</HI> Faction. Passing on further by the <HI>Maes,</HI> I left <HI>Proye</HI> on the left hand, and <HI>Huesden</HI> on the right, and the next day morning arrived at the <HI>Bosche.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Bosse▪</HI></NOTE> <HI>Hertogen Bosche, Sylva Ducis, Boscum Ducis, Boisleduc, Bolduc,</HI> takes its name from a Wood belonging to the Dukes of <HI>Brabant.</HI> It is a strong pleasant City, seated upon the River <HI>Disa</HI> or <HI>Deese,</HI> which enters the <HI>Maes,</HI> about two Leagues below it; one of the greatest Cities in <HI>Brabant;</HI> and for its strength, for which 'tis beholden both to Nature and to Art, the States of the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces</HI> possess not any one more considerable, and is a very good Frontier against all Enemies on this side: It is encompassed on
<PB N="104" REF="62"/>
all sides with Fens and Marshy Grounds. The <HI>Avenues</HI> to it are by narrow Causeys, made turning and winding, to be commanded in all places by one or other of the six Sconces or Forts built at some di∣stance without the Town for its greater Security. Besides which, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> having some reason to be jealous of the Inhabitants, whose affections might incline them towards the neighbouring Princes, of whose Religion most of them are, they have built a Cittadel within the Town, a Briel or pair of Spectacles to look more accurately into their Affairs. It is a handsom regular Fort of five Bastions, each Curtain is 84 ordinary paces long; the Faces of each Bastion 63; and the Flank or Neck 24. There is a handsome House of Stone for the Centry at the point of each Bastion, and the middle of each Curtain, every one of which cost Seven hundred Guldens. Here is also a Field Canon of an extraordinary length, said to be able to fling a Bullet almost as far as <HI>Bommel.</HI> The Piazza in this Town is Triangular.</P>
<P>This City was made an Episcopal See, 1559. The Cathedral is De∣dicated to St. <HI>John.</HI> In the Quire are painted the Arms of many of the Knights of the <HI>Golden Fleece.</HI> And over the upper Stalls or Seats, an Inscription in <HI>French,</HI> which contains the History of the first Insti∣tution, and Model of this Order, by the most High and mighty Prince <HI>Philip</HI> the Good, Duke of <HI>Burgundy, Lorain,</HI> and <HI>Brabant,</HI> in the year 1429, who then named four and twenty Knights, besides the head of the Order, to whom he gave a Chain of Gold, and a Golden Fleece; for which this Inscription was thought fit to be placed upon his Tomb,</P>
<LG>
<L>Pour maintenir l'eglise</L>
<L>Qui est de Dieu Maison,</L>
<L>I'ay mis sus le noble Ordre,</L>
<L>Qu'on nomme le Toison.</L>
</LG>
<P>Besides divers Statua's and Pillars. There are also several Monuments of the Bishops of <HI>Bosche</HI> and others.</P>
<P>This Town was taken from the King of <HI>Spain</HI> by the Forces of the Confederate Estates, in the year 1628. after a long and chargeable Siege; in which the little Sconce, one of the Forts towards the South, did excellent Service.</P>
<P>Divers of the Nuns were still alive in this Town, but at <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> they were all dead.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Breda.</NOTE> From the <HI>Bosche</HI> we travelled through a plain Country, somewhat Sandy, to <HI>Breda</HI> upon the River <HI>Merck:</HI> A place very considerable, pleasantly seated▪ and well-fortified. It hath formerly had more Out∣works than at present: For they have taken away the Crown-works; and left only the Half-moons and Horn-works, and Conserves or Con∣tregards about the Half-moons. There is a large Ditch of Water round the Counterscarp, and a small Ravelin between each Bastion, joyned to the Rampart within side of the Ditch. There is also a double Hay or Quickset-hedge almost quite round the Town, besides Palisado's. The <HI>Parapet</HI> is very thick, and strengthned with a row of Elms, and second∣ed with another row at three or four yards distance, round the Town; the bodies of the <HI>Bastions</HI> are sunk down or hollowed away, and filled with a thicket of Elms. The Half Moons are the like without the
<PB N="105" REF="62"/>
To wn, and after all, a brest-work between the Town and the <HI>Bastions;</HI> and Cavaliers upon several places of the Rampart.</P>
<P>This Town belongs unto the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> unto whom it hath descended by the right of the house of <HI>Nassaw,</HI> by the Marriage of <HI>En∣gelbert</HI> the seventh Earl of that house, with <HI>Mary</HI> daughter and Heir of <HI>Philip</HI> the last Lord thereof, about the year 1400. It was taken by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the beginning of the Low Country Wars, and was after∣wards surprized by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> by a stratagem performed by eighty men hid in a Boat covered over with Turf, and let into the Castle. In the year 1625. the <HI>Spaniards</HI> took it again, as by Inscriptions and <HI>Chronograms</HI> are to be seen in divers places, as that over the door of the Church.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gertruydenberg.</NOTE> Leaving <HI>Breda</HI> we soon came by Land to St. <HI>Gertruydenberg,</HI> the last Town on the North of <HI>Brabant,</HI> where it joyned to the Pro∣vince of <HI>Holland,</HI> a small place, but a good Town for fishing, lying upon a Hill near the great broad Water called <HI>de Waert,</HI> made by the falling of the <HI>Maes</HI> and many other Rivers into it. This Town is fortified and Garrisoned. The Church and Steeple have been Large and fair, and the ruines of the Latter are observable, in regard that this Steeple was shot down by a Stratagem of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> while the Governor and chief of the Town were upon it, to observe a false alarm in the Prince's Camp, and so lost themselves and the Town.

We passed from hence over a large Water which hath overflow'd a great part of the Country upon one side of it, no less than seventy two Pa∣rishes being drowned at once, the Village of <HI>Ramsdun</HI> only escaping, and so by an old Tower called the house of <HI>Murvey,</HI> to the <HI>Maiden</HI> Town of <HI>Dort,</HI> or <HI>Dordrecht.</HI></P>

<P>In this Town are many fair houses and pleasant Gardens. The great Church is large, the Steeple 312 steps high; the top thereof being made of four large Dyalls. There is also an Exchange or Place for Merchants to meet. The <HI>English</HI> have two Churches, and the <HI>French</HI> one. The Key or Head to the water side is handsome, and the Coun∣try about very pleasant; we saw the Chamber wherein the <HI>Synod</HI> of <HI>Dort</HI> was assembled 1611. a large fair room; and took a collation in the same house, in a high turret overlooking the Town and Country: Our seats Moving round about the Table continually; so as the diver∣sity of the prospect made it more delightful. The great Vessels round∣bellied, which trade between <HI>Coln</HI> and this City seemed strange; as also the long <HI>Luyck</HI> or <HI>Liege</HI>-boats; and the number of People that conti∣nually live in them.

and the whole Country about it is fruitful; either divided into Gardens and Orchards, or Planted with <HI>Madder, Pompions,</HI> or Grain and Fruits. The <HI>Zealanders</HI> are generally addicted to the interest of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and great Lovers of his Person. I found them not a little delighted that the Prince had been with them some days before, and was made <HI>Premier</HI> Noble, or chief of the States of <HI>Zealand;</HI> which was chiefly brought about, as I was informed, by <HI>Pensioner Hubert, le Sage, Duvelaer</HI> and <HI>Vriebergen,</HI> formerly no great friends to the Prince, especially <HI>Vriebergen,</HI> who was the most earnest of any to bring him in, in despite to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> for General <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rts</HI> his sake, who being set over the <HI>Zealand</HI> forces by those of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> lately affronted <HI>Vriebergen</HI>'s Son, who was a Colo∣nel at the Head of his Regiment.

Flissinga</HI> or <HI>Vlussing</HI> hath Stone-Walls towards the Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flushing.</NOTE> and Mudworks towards the Land; a very good Port, and a strong Town; the waves of the Sea washing it walls; it was one of the first Towns which the Low Country men took from the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the year 1572, and was made Cautionary to Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> together with <HI>Rammaki ns</HI> and the <HI>Briel.</HI> 1585. The renowned Sir. <HI>Philip Sidney</HI> being the first Governor of it, and surrendered by King <HI>James</HI> to the United states, 1616. The Sea shoar here abouts is not only faced with rushes, flaggs and reeds staked down as high as the Tide usually arises, but it is also strongly bound over with Osiers and hurdles and great Posts driven in to break the force of the Water, and secure the Piles which make the Harbour or Havens mouth. The Town-house is handsomly built, standing in the <HI>Piazza,</HI> having three rows of Pillars in the Front one above another; the Lower <HI>Dorick,</HI> the second <HI>Ionick,</HI> and the highest <HI>Corinthian;</HI> and on the top there is a Gallery or Balcony to Discover ships at Sea. This is the third Port for the East-<HI>India</HI> trade; <HI>Amster∣dam</HI> and <HI>Rotterdam</HI> being the first and second: here lay many great ships in the middle of the Town, and considerable men of War, as the St. <HI>Patrick,</HI> and the Admiral of <HI>Zealand:</HI> we saw them also building of divers ships, and when the Prince was here they lanched one to di∣vertise him, to which he gave the name of William <HI>Frederick,</HI> they also presented him with a Golden Bottle; that being the Arms of the Town: the Prince Landed at <HI>Armuyden,</HI> and went from thence to <HI>Tergoes,</HI> and thence to <HI>Breda;</HI> they reported his entertainment in <HI>Walcheren</HI> a∣mounted to fifty thousand <HI>Guldens.</HI> The Women in this Island wear most of them red Cloth and straw-Hats; if a Man dies a great bundle of Straw is laid at the Door, if a Boy, a little one if a Woman, the straw lies on the left side of the Door: when any woman is brought to bed, they fasten a piece of Lawne to the ring and rapper of the Door, and make it up into a little baby or puppet finely pleated, and in such manner, as to distinguish of what sex the young Child is.</P>
<P>Returning to <HI>Middleburg</HI> by Land I observed there was a row of Trees round the Town between the moat and rampart, where ordina∣rily there is only a breast-work or a hedge, and embarked at <HI>Middle∣burg</HI> again, and passed down the River by the fort <HI>Rammakins,</HI> and so for the <HI>Schelde,</HI> Sayling up that noble River till we had passed the Fort, <HI>Frederick Henrick,</HI> and came to <HI>Lillo;</HI> where we stayed till the Ves∣sel

Over against <HI>Lillo,</HI> lies another Fortification, call∣ed <HI>Lifgens hoek;</HI> the Fort <HI>de la croix</HI> is the last that belongs to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and lies on the North side of the River; the Banks are cut nigh to it, and the Country drowned for its greater Security.

<P>The River <HI>Scaldis</HI> or <HI>Scheld</HI> mentioned by <HI>Caesar</HI> is a gallant River, affording plenty of Fish, and convenience for Navigation and passage unto several noted places: It arises in the Country of <HI>Vermandois,</HI> pas∣sing to <HI>Cambray, Valencienne,</HI> so to <HI>Tournay</HI> or <HI>Dornick, Oudenard, Gaunt, Rupelmond</HI> and <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and pursuing its course is afterwards divided into two streams, whereof the Southern is called the <HI>Hont;</HI> the other runs by <HI>Bergen ap Zome,</HI> and afterward into the Sea between the Isles of <HI>Zealand.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Antwerp.</NOTE> The next day morning we went on our Voyage still up the <HI>Scaldis</HI> or <HI>Schelde,</HI> and arrived at <HI>Antwerp.</HI> Where I had the good fortune to see Mr. <HI>Hartop;</HI> one very well known in all those parts, and of high esteem for his personal strength and valour. A Gentleman also so courteous that he makes it his business to oblige strangers; he shew'd me many curiosities in this City, carrying me with him in his Coach.</P>
<P>The Walls of <HI>Antwerp</HI> are very large, faced with Brick and Free∣stone, having divers rows of Trees upon them, broad walks, and con∣veniences for the Coaches, to make their tour upon. The <HI>Bastions</HI> are not so large as generally they build now a dayes, yet after the modern▪ way. The Ditch is very broad and deep, the Country about it, all Gardens. The <HI>Cittadel</HI> is a regular Fortification of five <HI>Bastions,</HI> where∣in lies always a Garrison of <HI>Spanish</HI> Souldiers: upon every curtain there are two mounts or Cavaliers; and between them below, a row of building or lodgings for the Souldiers; the ears of the <HI>Bastions</HI> are cut down, and <HI>Casamates</HI> made or <HI>Case matte,</HI> and Palisado's set round upon the <HI>Esplanade;</HI> the Walls are lined with excellent Brick and Stone, nor is there any where a more regular beautiful Fortification of five <HI>Bastions</HI> that is finished: it commands the City, the River and the Country: besides this <HI>Cittadel</HI> there is another Fort within the Town near the <HI>Schelde,</HI> to command the River, having eight Guns in it, called St. <HI>Laurence</HI> Fort.</P>
<P>The Exchange is handsome, supported by 36 Pillars, every one of a different carving, four streets lead unto it, so that standing in the mid∣dle we see through every one of them. The <HI>Meer</HI> or Largest street is considerable for the water running under it, and for the meeting of Coaches upon it every evening to make their tour through the streets of the City, which are clean and beautiful; at one end of it stands a large Brass Crucifix upon a Pedestal of Marble. The <HI>Jesuites</HI> Church goes far beyond any of that bigness that I have seen out of <HI>Italy.</HI> The Front is noble, with the Statua of <HI>Ignatius Loyala</HI> on the top. A great part of the inside of the Roof was painted by <HI>Rubens,</HI> and some of it by <HI>Van Dyke:</HI> there be many Excellent peices of flowers done by <HI>Se∣gers a Jesuite;</HI> the Carving and gilding of all the works is exquisite: The Library of the College is great, and the Books disposed handsome∣ly into four Chambers: the Founder hereof was <HI>Godfridus Houtappel,</HI> whose Monument, together with his Wife and Children are worth

the seeing, in a Chappel on the South side of this Church. In the Church of the <HI>Carmeli tes</HI> is a large Silver Statua of our Lady, and models of Ci∣ties in stone. <HI>Onser Lieven-Vrowen Kerck,</HI> or <HI>the Church of our blessed Lady</HI> is the greatest in the City; and the Steeple one of the fairest in World, five hundred foot high: one of their feet is eleven of our inches; so as it is 459 of our feet: In this Church there is much carving, and a great number of Pictures highly esteemed; among which one piece is much taken notice of, drawn by <HI>Quintin</HI> at first a Smith, who made the neat Iron work of the Well before the West door; and afterwards to obtain his Mistress, he proved a famous Painter; his head is set up in Stone at the entrance of the Church, with an inscription and this verse;
<Q><L>Connubialis amor de Mulcibre fecit Apellem.</L></Q></P>
<P>I was at the famous Abby of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> pleasantly seated upon the <HI>Schelde;</HI> where, among other curiosities, I saw a glass, which represented the Pictures of our <HI>Saviour</HI> and and the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> collected from the putting together of divers other heads: One was represented from a Picture wherein were thirteen faces, and another from one of twelve: over the blessed Virgin was this Inscription;
<Q><L>Diva nitet varis expressa Maria Figuris.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Countess of <HI>Brabant</HI>'s Tomb, who was drowned, and her <HI>Sta∣tua,</HI> as also the Monument of <HI>Ortelius,</HI> are here shewn. <HI>Marcarius Si∣moneus</HI> was then Abbot, the Monks 63. Near unto the Wharf-gate is the Church of St. <HI>Walburgis,</HI> an English Saint, who contributed much to∣wards the conversion of these Countries.</P>
<P>The Town-house is fair, the House built for the East-country Mer∣chants is very stately and large, but runs now to ruine, in this I saw, among other curiosities, divers strange Musical instruments, which at present are not understood, or at least not made use of: The <HI>Hessen</HI> house hath been also formerly considerable. The water which they make use of in Brewing, is brought by an Aqueduct from <HI>Heren∣tall</HI> about thirty miles distant from hence; and is conveyed into the Town by a large Channel, peculiarly walled in by it self where it pas∣ses the Ditch; in this City are many good collections of Pictures both Ancient and Modern, and excellent Miniature or Liming by <HI>Gonsol;</HI> one fine piece, which I saw was peculiarly remarkable, it being the work of 35 several Masters.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Brussels.</NOTE> From <HI>Antwerp,</HI> I passed to <HI>Brussels</HI> by water changing Boats five times, and going through divers locks, by reason the Country is so much higher about <HI>Brussels,</HI> and the water above two hundred foot lower at <HI>Antwerp.</HI> At <HI>Fontaine</HI> a league and half from <HI>Brussels,</HI> three Rivers cross one another: one of them being carried over a bridge. The <HI>Piaz∣za</HI> of <HI>Brussels</HI> is fair, and oblong in figure; upon one of the longest sides stands the Town-house, and over against it the Kings-house, where up∣on a Scaffold hanged with Velvet, Count, <HI>Egmond</HI> and <HI>Horne</HI> were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>headed, the whole <HI>Piazza</HI> being hanged with Black Cloth.

in Brass, Count <HI>Marsin</HI>'s house formerly belonging to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> hath a fair Court, and overlooks a good part of the City, but a quarter of it is ruined by Lightning. The Thunderbolt or Stone which they affirm to have effected it, is bigger than two Mens heads, and hangs up upon the door at the entrance. The <HI>Jesuites</HI> Church is handsom, and in it the fair white Tower is beautifully gilded at the top. The <HI>Carmelites</HI> Church hath a noble Altar, and near unto the Church is the <HI>Statua</HI> of a pissing boy, which is a continual Conduit. The Armory was well furnished as we were informed, before the Go∣vernors of the low Countries sold the Arms; and <HI>Cassel Roderigo,</HI> the Governor, left it very bare. There remains the Armour of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, of Duke <HI>Albert,</HI> of the Prince of <HI>Parma, Ernestus,</HI> and of the Duke <HI>d'Alva,</HI> and of the Duke <HI>Alberts</HI> horse, who being shot saved his Master, and died the same day twelve month; Spears for the hunting the wild Boar, one with two Pistols; The Armour of Cardinal <HI>Infante,</HI> and of an <HI>Indian</HI> King; A <HI>Polish</HI> musket which carries six hundred paces; <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth's Sword for the making the Knights of the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth's Sword sent to declare war; Good Bucklers for De∣fence, and some well wrought; especially one with the Battel of <HI>Phrrhus</HI> and his Elephants; and banners taken with <HI>Francis</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> at the Battel of <HI>Pavia.</HI></P>
<P>Somewhat like <HI>Godfrey</HI> of <HI>Bouillons</HI> shooting the three Pigeons near the Tower of <HI>David,</HI> is the shot which <HI>Infanta Isabella</HI> made, when with an Arrow she killed a Bird, in memory whereof, a Bird pierced with an Arrow is set upon the top of a Tower in the Court, which is large; and if the New Buildings and Design were continued, it would be very handsome Before the Court stands five brass Statues. The Park is pleasant, with Trees set in order, and adorned with Grotto's, Fountains, and Water-works, which come very near the <HI>Italian;</HI> one piece somewhat imitating <HI>Frascati,</HI> in which all Musical Instruments are imitated, and a perpetual motion attempted: and on the Front of the Buildings stand the <HI>Caesars</HI> heads. But the Echo is most remarka∣ble; which may perfectly be distinguished to ten or twelve Replies. The greatest Church is that of St. <HI>Gudula;</HI> in which is her Statua, the Devil striving to blow out the Light of her Lanthorn. The two Chappels therein are remarkable; the one built by <HI>Leopoldus▪</HI> very fair on the out-side: the other towards the North, hath been visited by five Kings; in which is the Host which bled being stabbed by the Jews. In the <HI>Dominican</HI> Church is the Monument of the Duke of <HI>Cleve</HI> and his Dutchess, in <HI>Corinthian</HI> brass. But for a New Church that of the <HI>Be∣gennes,</HI> or Pious Maids, is very considerable; there being Eight hun∣dred of them in this City, who have a particular place allotted to them, where they have built this milk-white Church. The Plague was much in this place at that time, three hundred Houses being shut, up and Gar∣lands placed on the doors, in the middle of which was written IH<SUP>†</SUP>S. I saw the <HI>English</HI> Nunnery, and other considera∣ble Buildings. And after I had refreshed my self at the Fish-Tavern, which is worth the seeing, especially for two Rooms in it, furnished from top to bottom with very good Pictures, I returned to <HI>Antwerp.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Maestreicht.</NOTE> <HI>Trajectum ad Mos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m</HI> or <HI>Maestreicht,</HI> is a strong Town, seated upon the <HI>Maes,</HI> four Leagues below <HI>Liege.</HI> The Out-works are very con∣siderable; the Wall is old. Towards the South-east lies a Hill, which arises gently, and overlooks part of the Town. Under this Hill is one of the noblest Quarries of Stone in the World. To secure the Town from the disadvantage it might receive from this Hill, there was formerly a Fort built upon it, but it hath been long since slighted; and they have made out an Horn-work within Musket-shot of it, and the Bastion answering to it is made very high, to cover the Town. On the other side of the River stands <HI>Wicke,</HI> very well fortified also, and rather stronger than <HI>Maestreicht,</HI> into which they might retire if the Town should be taken by Storm, it being united to <HI>Maestreicht</HI> by a handsom Bridge over the <HI>Maes,</HI> consisting of Nine Arches. All about <HI>Wicke</HI> the Country is flat: there are many Inhabitants in it, and a handsom Glass-house.</P>
<P>The private Houses of <HI>Maestreicht</HI> are generally covered with a black Slat, or Ardoise, otherwise not very beautiful. The Town∣house is fair, seated in one of the <HI>Piazza's,</HI> built of white Stone; it hath Nine large Windows in a row on each side, and within is very well painted by <HI>Theodorus van der Schuer,</HI> who was Painter to the Queen of <HI>Sweden.</HI> In another <HI>Piazza</HI> is a Fountain, rows of Trees, and the great Church. This Town was besieged and taken from the King of <HI>Spain</HI> by the Confederate States in the year 1632.</P>

Upon many of the Tombs which are old, are Crosses and Lamps. Ma∣ny Bones and Heads of the Martyrs are also kept in this Church. The Cathedral is dedicated to St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and is very large, but not finished. The Body of the Church hath four rows of Pillars within it. The Quire is handsome and very high: behind it are believed to be the Tombs of the three Wise men which came from the East to worship our Saviour, or the Kings of <HI>Arabia,</HI> of whom it was prophesied that they should bring Gifts, commonly called the three Kings of <HI>Colen: Mel∣chior,</HI> who offered Gold, <HI>Gaspar</HI> Frankincense, and <HI>Balthasar</HI> Myrrh. Their Bodies, as the account goes, were first removed to <HI>Constantino∣ple</HI> by <HI>Helena,</HI> the Mother of <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great; then to <HI>Milan</HI> by <HI>Eustorsius</HI> Bishop thereof; and they have now rested at <HI>Colen</HI> for above five hundred years, being translated from <HI>Milan</HI> hither by <HI>Rainoldus</HI> Bishop of <HI>Colen,</HI> in the year 1164. There are also divers other Monu∣ments of Bishops, and Noble Persons in Brass and Stone, and one in the shape of a Castle with six Towers. The Canons of this Church are all Noblemen; among whom the Duke of <HI>Newburg,</HI> who ordinarily resides at <HI>Dusseldorff,</HI> about twenty <HI>English</HI> miles below this City, upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> hath two Sons. In a Church dedicated to all the Apostles, they shew us a Tomb, which being opened by Thieves, intending to plunder it, the Woman buried in it arose up and went home, and lived with her Husband divers years after. In one of the Streets is a Tower, or rather one Tower upon another, which seems to be ancient, now made a Prison. Upon another Ruine also in the Streets lies a Tomb made out of one Stone; of which sort of Tombs there are many in this City and other places; but the greatest number of them I ever saw was at <HI>Arles</HI> in <HI>Provence.</HI></P>
<P>The Senate House is Noble, having a fair Tower upon it, from whence there is a good prospect over the City. Upon the Front of the Senate House is a Man in <HI>Basso relievo,</HI> fighting with a Lyon, who, as it was related to me, was formerly one of the Consuls, who having had a contest with some Clergy-men about the Government of the Ci∣ty, on a suddain they caused a Lyon to be let in upon him: upon which occasion he behaved himself so well, as he delivered himself, and slew the Lyon.</P>
<P>The Elector or Archbishop of <HI>Colen</HI> hath two Places in the City, but by agreement between him and the Town, he is not to stay here above three days together. Only this present Archbishop, upon the coming down of the Imperial Forces, and his loss of <HI>Bonna,</HI> took Sanctuary here in the Convent of St. <HI>Pantaleon,</HI> where he continued a great while.</P>
<P>The City is Imperial and Free, and yet it doth Homage to the Elect∣or, much after this Form: <HI>We free Citizens of</HI> Colen <HI>promise to the Archbishop, to be faithful and favourable unto him as long as he preserves</HI>
<PB N="115" REF="67"/>
<HI>us in Right and Honour, and in our ancient Pivileges, Ʋs, our Wives, our Children, and our City of</HI> Colen. Most of the City are of the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Church, and the whole Town so full of Convents, Churches, Church∣men and Reliques, that it is not undeservedly styled the <HI>Rome</HI> of <HI>Ger∣many.</HI> The <HI>Lutherans</HI> have also a Church within the Walls, and the <HI>Calvinists</HI> at <HI>Malheim,</HI> half a League down the stream on the other side of the <HI>Rhine.</HI></P>
<P>Over against <HI>Colen</HI> lies <HI>Dutz,</HI> a small Village, inhabited chiefly by Jews. The Vessels which come out of tho <HI>Low-Countries</HI> hither are long, round bellied, and of great burden. Near to the Wall of the Town, upon the Quay or Key, is a kind of Harbour made for them, into which they may be drawn, and escape the Injuries they would other∣wise suffer by the Ice in Winter.</P>
<P>Besides the rich Clergy, there are many wealthy Citizens and Mer∣chants here, and they maintain a Traffick and Correspondence with divers Countries, especially by the convenience of the <HI>Rhine.</HI> They speak not the best <HI>High-dutch;</HI> but <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>French</HI> are understood by many: Divers Hosts in Inns speak <HI>Latin,</HI> and the Servants <HI>French;</HI> which proves a good help unto Travellers. It was made an University about the year 1388. Besides the General Hospitals for young and old persons, there are two for the Sick, and well accommodated. They have a <HI>Pharmacopaea Coloniensis,</HI> or a <HI>Dispensatory</HI> proper to the place, whereby <HI>Apothecaries</HI> compound their Medicines. I was acquainted with one of the best, Mr. <HI>Elburg,</HI> a knowing and obliging person, who was his Late Majesty King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's Apothecary while he resided at <HI>Colen,</HI> and whom my honoured Friend Sir <HI>Alexander Fraser,</HI> his Majesties chief Physician, made use of, who lived in great reputa∣tion in this City.</P>
<P>Two hundred years since <HI>Aeneas Sylvius</HI> left an high expression con∣cerning this place, <HI>Colonia quae de conjuge</HI> Claudii <HI>matre</HI> Neronis, A∣grippina <HI>dicta est, &amp; trium Magorum ossibus illustrata, nihil magnificen∣tius, nihil ornatius, totâ</HI> Europâ <HI>reperias:</HI> which though, if strictly construed, will hardly be admitted by any who hath beheld <HI>Paris, Na∣ples, Venice,</HI> &amp;c. yet doth it declare the nobleness of this City, even in former times.</P>
<P>We left <HI>Colen</HI> about four a Clock in the Afternoon, being drawn up the Stream with Horses, they being made fast by a very long Rope to the Mast; we lodged in a small Village, having had a good prospect of <HI>Colen</HI> all this Evening from off the water. Near to this Place <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> made his Bridge over the <HI>Rhine.</HI> The next day we came to <HI>Bon,</HI> the Seat of the present Archbishop and Elector of <HI>Colen, Maximi∣lianus Henricus,</HI> Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Hildisheim</HI> and <HI>Liege,</HI> and Arch-Chancellor of the Empire throughout <HI>Italy.</HI> This place was for∣merly called <HI>Bonna,</HI> or <HI>Castra Bonnensia,</HI> the wintering place, in the time of <HI>Tacitus,</HI> of the sixth Legion. It was not long since very well fortified by the order of the present Archbishop, and the direction of Colonel <HI>Biser,</HI> a blind man, having <HI>Cataracts</HI> in both his eyes. The Archbishops Palace is very Noble, and there is a Chamber seated a good way into the <HI>Rhine,</HI> to which they pass thorow a Gallery. This Night we lodged at the foot of the highest of the seven Hills by the <HI>Rhine,</HI> which are seen at a great distance; and upon divers of them stand old ruined Castles. On the 15<HI>th</HI> we passed by a pleasant Island with a
<PB N="116" REF="68"/>
Convent in it: at <HI>Remagen</HI> is also a Convent upon a Rock, fortified with round Towers. In the Evening we lodged near to a Castle, ruin∣ed four years before by the Electors of <HI>Triers</HI> and <HI>Colen,</HI> it belonging at that time to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain.</HI> On the 16<HI>th</HI> early in the Morn∣ing we came to <HI>Andernach,</HI> where the Plague was very much at that time, and they kept a great many of their sick in Boats upon the <HI>Rhine.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Andernach.</NOTE> <HI>Andernach,</HI> of old <HI>Anten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>um,</HI> was one of the <HI>Roman</HI> Fortresses. Up∣on this River, some think that <HI>Caligula</HI> was born, and that <HI>Valentinian</HI> was buried thereabouts. Near unto this place are also Mineral Springs, well frequented, and much made use of. The Town is encompassed with an old Wall; and the Gates were shut up by reason of the Plague: Notwithstanding, there being divers Friars in our Company, several of the Towns-men sent out dishes of Meat to them, which we eat in the Field upon Trees which were laid along near the Town. This day the passage by water seeming tedious to us, Mr. <HI>Mulstroh,</HI> a worthy <HI>Ger∣man</HI> Gentleman, with whom I travelled as far as <HI>Spire,</HI> was willing we should hire a Coach together, which we did, and invited the Friars with whom we had breakfasted, to go along with us in it to <HI>Coblentz.</HI> We passed through a very pleasant Country, between rows of <HI>Walnut∣trees,</HI> in sight of two of the Elector of <HI>Triers</HI> Houses, and near to a House belonging to the Count <HI>de Wert.</HI></P>
<P>We passed the <HI>Mosella</HI> over a handsome Stone-bridge of thirteen Ar∣ches, built by Archbishop <HI>Baldus,</HI> or <HI>Balduinus,</HI> in the year 1344. and coming into the Town, we went to the <HI>Dominican</HI> Convent, which is pleasantly seated near the Banks of the River <HI>Mosella;</HI> but the Prior of the Convent, whom we had brought with us, was so obliging, that he would not part with us that night; and we were very civilly enter∣tained by him in his Lodgings: He invited also some of the Convent to bear us company; and after a handsome Supper, with plenty of ex∣cellent <HI>Mosella</HI> Wine, we went to bed between two Feather-beds.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Coblentz.</NOTE> <HI>Coblentz,</HI> or <HI>Confluentia,</HI> is a Town of a Triangular Figure, seated at the meeting of two great Rivers, the <HI>Rhine</HI> and the <HI>Mosella,</HI> which make two sides thereof, and the third is made by a Line drawn from one River to the other; which is now well fortified after the most re∣gular Modern way. The Wall within these Works had many old high Towers; and formerly there was another still nearer to the uniting of the Rivers, and consequently containing a less space of ground: This Town is under the Elector and Archbishop of <HI>Triers, Carolus Caspar,</HI> of the Noble Family of the <HI>Leyen,</HI> Arch-Chancellor for the Empire in <HI>Gal∣lia Belgica,</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Arles.</HI> It was given to the Church of <HI>Triers</HI> when <HI>Medoaldus</HI> was Archbishop, above a thousand years since, in the time of King <HI>Dagobert.</HI> The Situation is pleasant and convenient, and lies over against the Castle of <HI>Hermanstein,</HI> or <HI>Ehren∣brei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stein,</HI> that is, <HI>The Stone of far extended Honour;</HI> at the foot of which Castle, upon the shoar of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> under a great Rock, stands a very Noble Palace of the Electors, two large Wings and the Front with five Pavilions standing towards the River, and from it a long Bridge of Boats over the <HI>Rhine</HI> to <HI>Coblentz:</HI> when any great Vessel passes by, they let slip three Boats, whereby the passage lies open, and make them fast again afterwards. In the <HI>German</HI> Wars the <HI>Spaniards</HI> thrust in a Garrison into this Town; which was afterwards beaten out by the
<PB N="117" REF="68"/>
<HI>Rhinegrave</HI> for the King of <HI>Sweden;</HI> and the strong Castle of <HI>Ehren∣breitstein</HI> being put into the hands of the <HI>French,</HI> the Emperours Forces seized upon the Archbishop of <HI>Triers,</HI> who then was <HI>Philippus Chris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o∣phorus,</HI> and carried him away to <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P>In places where the <HI>Rhine</HI> runs through a low Country and a sat Soyl, it washes away the Banks: to secure which, in divers places they have made great Works of Wood, and also to secure Vessels from the danger of the Ice. And I remember, riding near the Banks of the River <HI>Loire</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> I observed them in some places to be handsome∣ly defended for a long way together with Freestone.</P>
<P>Near unto <HI>Coblentz,</HI> upon a Hill, is a Convent of <HI>Carthusians. Octo∣ber</HI> the 17<HI>th</HI> we went up the <HI>Rhine</HI> to <HI>Boppart,</HI> a walled Town, upon the western bank, where <HI>Van Trump</HI> was at that time: It is a very old Town, one of the <HI>Roman</HI> Fortresses against the <HI>Germans,</HI> called anciently <HI>Bodobriga;</HI> some would have it called <HI>Bopport</HI> from <HI>Beauport, Fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣haven,</HI> or <HI>Bonport,</HI> a good convenient place for Vessels to retire into, or to ride in.</P>
<P>On the 18<HI>th</HI> we dined at St. <HI>Guer,</HI> a pleasant Town belonging to the <HI>Landtgrave</HI> of <HI>Hesse,</HI> who hath a Castle here. Coming on shoar we met with an odd custom: for upon the Wall side there is fastned a Collar of Brass at present, but was formerly of Lead, and given by <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth; into this most Strangers that come put their Necks, at which time they ask them, <HI>Whether they will be sprinkled with wa∣ter, or drink wine?</HI> and if they choose the latter, they give an enter∣tainment of Wine to the Company. The Queen of <HI>Sweden</HI> passing by this place, gave a great Silver Cup; out of which they now drink at this Ceremony. We lodged this night at <HI>Wesel,</HI> a Town situated between a high Hill and the River, belonging to the Archbishop of <HI>Triers.</HI> Here in the Market-place they shew'd us the print of St. <HI>Hubert</HI>'s Horses foot in a Free-stone.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Baccharach.</NOTE> On the 19<HI>th</HI> we came to <HI>Baccharach,</HI> or <HI>ad Bacchiaras,</HI> belonging to the Elector <HI>Palatine;</HI> a place famous for excellent Wines. We passed by an old Castle seated upon a Rock in the middle of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> being of an irregular figure, called <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alts,</HI> where formerly the Prince<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalts Caste.</NOTE> <HI>Palatines</HI> of the <HI>Rhine</HI> were born, the Princesses being sent hither to be brought to Bed. We came this night to <HI>Dreickshausen;</HI> the next day we went by a dangerous Passage, there being many Rocks under wa∣ter, which cause the River to run very rapid and unequally. A little above this we came to a round Tower, on a Rock in the <HI>Rhine,</HI> called<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mouse-Tower.</NOTE> the <HI>Mouse-tower,</HI> built by <HI>Hatto</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Mentz,</HI> in the year 900. who, as the Story goes, in a time of great Scarcity, pretending to re∣lieve the poor who wanted bread, invited them together into a Barn, where he burnt them all, saying, <HI>They were like the Rats and Mice which would devour the Corn.</HI> After which he was so persecuted with Rats and Mice, that to avoid them he caused this Tower to be built in the middle of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> which did not avail him, for they followed him thither also, and at last devoured him. A little above this lies <HI>Bing</HI> upon the Western shoar; a considerable Town, belonging to the Elector of <HI>Mentz:</HI> here our Boat stayed to pay Custom, as it had done also at <HI>Bonna, Liutz, Hammerstein, Andernach, Coblentz, Lode∣sheim, Bopport,</HI> St. <HI>Gower, Cub,</HI> and <HI>Baccarach.</HI> For the trade of the <HI>Rhine</HI> being great, Princes and Lords who have Towns upon it, make

use of that advantage, which, though it abates the gains of the Mer∣chant, brings considerable profit to themselves.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bing.</NOTE> <HI>Bing,</HI> or <HI>Bingium,</HI> was an old <HI>Roman</HI> Fortress upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> where the River <HI>Navus</HI> or <HI>Naw</HI> enters into it; over which latter there is a handsome Stone-bridge: In this Town were many of the Duke of <HI>Lor∣rain</HI>'s Army sick and wounded, who three weeks before had maintain∣ed a fight against the Forces of the Elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> near this place. From <HI>Bing</HI> we continued our Journey to <HI>Mentz:</HI> at <HI>Rudesheim</HI> in <HI>Rhine∣gaw,</HI> a place noted for good Wine, they shewed us a Boy, whose hair was thick and woolly, like to the <HI>African</HI> Moors, but of a fine white colour, which being somewhat an odd fight, I took away some of his hair with me.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mentz.</NOTE> <HI>Mentz, Moguntia, Moguntiacum,</HI> and by the <HI>French Mayence,</HI> is seated over against the Confluence of the River <HI>Main,</HI> with the <HI>Rhine,</HI> or ra∣ther a little below it; in a fertile Country, abounding in all Provisions and good Wine; it lies at length, and is most extended towards the River; and that part excels the other towards the Land, which is not so populous or well-built: It is a strong place, and well guarded; it hath many Churches and Monasteries, and some fair Buildings, espe∣cially those of publick concern, as the Palace of the Elector, and others: But the narrowness of the Streets, and many old Houses, take away much from the beauty of the City. It is an University, begun about the year 1486. or as others will have it 1461. This place also chal∣lenges the Invention of Printing, or at least the first promotion or perfection thereof: And the Territory about it is famous for the de∣struction of the <HI>Roman</HI> Legions under <HI>Varus,</HI> by the <HI>Germans. Gusta∣vus Adolphus,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> was wonderfully pleased upon the tak∣ing of this City, 1631. entring into it in State upon the 14<HI>th</HI> of <HI>De∣cember,</HI> it being his Birth-day, which began the 38<HI>th</HI> year of his life, and kept his Court and <HI>Christmas</HI> here; where at one time there were with him six chief Princes of the Empire, twelve Ambassadors of Kings, States, Electors, and Princes; besides Dukes and Lords, and the Mar∣tial men of his own Army. At the taking of the Town, they found great store of Ordnance and Powder; and the City redeemed it self from Pillage by giving the King a Ransom of Eighty thousand <HI>Dollars;</HI> and the Clergy and Jews gave Two and twenty thousand more; of which the Jews paid Eighteen thousand; Archbishop <HI>Wamhold</HI> saving himself upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and retiring to <HI>Colen.</HI> The King caused also two great Bridges to be made, one over the <HI>Main,</HI> founded upon fifteen great flat bottom'd Boats, the rest being built upon great Piles of Wood: Another over the <HI>Rhine</HI> supported by sixty one great flat Boats, each lying the distance of an Arch from one another; and many Families of people living sometimes in the Boats under the Bridge. The Bridge over the <HI>Main</HI> is taken away; but that over the <HI>Rhine</HI> is still continu∣ed: Upon which I saw the present Elector passing in his Coach; a Per∣son of great Gravity, of a middle Stature, having long grey Hair, and was very Princely attended; his Name is <HI>Joannes Philippus</HI> of the No∣ble Family of <HI>Schoenburg,</HI> Elector and Archbishop of <HI>Mentz,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Wurtzburg,</HI> and Bishop of <HI>Worms,</HI> Arch-Chancellor of the Empire for all <HI>Germany;</HI> the first of the <HI>Electoral College;</HI> in all publick Con∣ventions he sits at the right hand of the Emperor, and is a Successor of the famous <HI>Boniface,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> man, Bishop of <HI>Mentz,</HI> who very much
<PB N="119" REF="69"/>
promoted the Christian <HI>Religion</HI> in these parts. But though his Digni∣ty and Place excel the two other Ecclesiastical Electors of <HI>Colen</HI> and <HI>Triers,</HI> yet his Territories come short; and they lie not together, but scatteringly with those of the <HI>Palatinate, Spier, Franckfort,</HI> and divers places in <HI>Franconia.</HI> But of late he hath much encreased his Power, by seizing the great City of <HI>Erfurdt</HI> in <HI>Turingia,</HI> which he hath since much beautified and strengthned by a Citradel built upon St. <HI>Pe∣ters-hill.</HI></P>
<P>In the year One Thousand one hundred and fourteen, the Emperor <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth sent an Ambassador to the King of <HI>England, Henry</HI> the First, requesting that <HI>Maude</HI> the Kings daughter whom he had for∣merly espoused by Proxy, might now, being Marriage-able, be sent to him: to which request the King most willingly condescended, and the Princess was presently conducted by his greatest Peers into <HI>Germany,</HI> and at <HI>Mentz</HI> was married to <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, and there Crowned his Empress. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Franckfort.</NOTE></P>
<P>From <HI>Mentz</HI> I passed by water up the River <HI>Main,</HI> to <HI>Franckfort,</HI> a free City of the Empire, called <HI>Trajectum Franconum,</HI> a Passage or Ford of the <HI>Franks,</HI> as serving them for a Retreat, when they entred or re∣turned from <HI>Gaul;</HI> at present <HI>Franckford</HI> upon the <HI>Main,</HI> to difference it from <HI>Franckford</HI> upon the River <HI>Oder,</HI> which is an University: It is a large Town, divided into two parts by the River; the lesser called <HI>Saxonhausen,</HI> or <HI>Saxon-houses,</HI> united to the other by a Stone-bridge over the <HI>Main,</HI> of twelve or thirteen Arches. It is a place of good Trade, and well seated for it, as having the advantage of the River <HI>Main,</HI> which passes by <HI>Bamberg, Schweinfurt, Wurtzburg, Guemund,</HI> or <HI>Gaudia mundi;</HI> and also the <HI>Tauber,</HI> and other Rivers running into it, af∣fords conveniency for Commerce with the remoter parts of <HI>Franconia;</HI> and the <HI>Main</HI> running into the <HI>Rhine,</HI> makes a large communication both up and down that Stream.</P>
<P>But this place is most remarkable for the Election of the Emperor, which, by the Laws of the <HI>G lden Bull,</HI> should be in this City, as also for two great Marts or Fairs kept in <HI>March</HI> and <HI>September;</HI> at which times there is an extraordinary concourse of people from remote parts, in order to buying and selling of several Commodities, especially for Books, as well printed here as in other parts, whereof they afford two Catalogues every year, and have no small dealings that way, by the Factors of the <HI>Germans, Hollanders, Italians, French,</HI> and <HI>English:</HI> al∣though at other times their trading in Books seems not great; for when I was there out of the time of the Mart, the <HI>Stationers</HI> Shops being shut up, made but a dull show. Here are also a great number of good Horses bought and sold: and on the North-side of the City there is a spacious place for a Horse-Fair. The City is strong and well fortified; and most part of the Town are <HI>Lutherans.</HI> In the <HI>German</HI> Wars, the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> having taken <HI>Hanaw,</HI> sent a Messenger to <HI>Franckfort</HI> to know whether the City would peaceably and speedily set open their Gates unto him, and accept fairly of a Garrison, or stand to the hazard of a Siege: And although they were unwilling to yield, yet for fear of the worst, they consented, That the King should have free passage for his Army through the City; and that for the better as∣surance of it, six hundred of his men should be received for a Garrison into <HI>Saxonhausen;</HI> and also that the Magistrates and People should take
<PB N="120" REF="70"/>
an Oath unto his Majesty. So that upon the 17<HI>th</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> 1631. the King's Army passed through <HI>Saxonhausen</HI> over the Bridge, quite through the Town. Colonel <HI>Vitzthumb</HI> was left Governour in <HI>Saxon∣hausen;</HI> and the King himself rode bare headed through the Streets: and by his obliging behaviour did generally win the affections of the beholders; and three days after returned thither again with the <HI>Landt∣grave</HI> of <HI>Hessen-Cassell,</HI> and the <HI>Landtgrave</HI> of <HI>Hessen-Darmstadt,</HI> where they met the Seventeen Earls of the <HI>Wetteraw,</HI> or <HI>Veteravia,</HI> and were feasted in the same room where the Emperors at their Coronation use to be entertained.</P>
<P>In <HI>Saxonhausen</HI> there is a House anciently belonging unto the Knights of the <HI>Teutonick</HI> Order, which hath the privilege of a Sanctuary for Man-slayers and Bankrupts; but it is a security but for fourteen days. Upon this side th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re is the largest portion of Land belonging to <HI>Franck∣fort;</HI> on the other side very little.</P>
<P>This being a trading place, it is no wonder that there are so many Jews in it; for a distinction they wear great Ruffs, their Sons Bonnets, and their Wives a peculiar dress of their Head.</P>
<P>The Collegiate Church of St. <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> where many of the Em∣perors have been crowned, is large, hath a high Steeple, and is built of a red stone. There are divers handsome Fountains in the Town, and good Houses; in one of the best of which live Monsieur <HI>Pierre Neuf∣ville,</HI> a great Merchant, and a civil worthy person well known in most places of Commerce; who obliged me with Letters to <HI>Venice,</HI> and other places. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Darmstadt.</NOTE></P>
<P>From <HI>Franckfort</HI> I continued my Journey through the <HI>Bergstraes,</HI> passing by <HI>Darmstadt,</HI> which belongs to one of the Brothers of the House of <HI>Hessen,</HI> commonly known by the name of the <HI>Landtgrave</HI> of <HI>Hessen Darmstadt;</HI> and afterwards through a fruitful plain Coun∣try, in the sight of Hills, and sometimes near them: the whole Coun∣try planted with Walnut-trees, Vines, Corn, and in some places with Tabaco; till I arrived at <HI>Heidellerg.</HI></P>
<P>In coming into this Town we passed over the River <HI>Neccar, Nicer,</HI> or <HI>Necarus,</HI> upon a Bridge covered over from one end to another, with a large Roof of Wood: in the same manner is the long Bridge covered at the entrance of the City of <HI>Alessandria della paglia</HI> in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The River <HI>Nec∣car.</HI></NOTE> The River <HI>Neccar</HI> arises near the <HI>Sylva Martiana,</HI> now <HI>Swartzwald,</HI> or <HI>Black Forest,</HI> and passing through the Territories of the Duke of <HI>Wit∣tenberg,</HI> runs into the <HI>Rhine</HI> at <HI>Manheim:</HI> This, though none of the greatest, yet is a considerable River of <HI>Germany;</HI> and hath divers good Towns upon it and near it, as <HI>Sultz, Tubingen, Wirtingen, Essingen, Stut∣gard, Canstat, Lauffen, Hallbrun, Heidelberg.</HI></P>
<P>There being Wars at that time when I was in this Country, between the Elector <HI>Palatine</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Lorrain:</HI> The Elector resided for the most part at <HI>Frankendale,</HI> to be near his Forces.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heidelberg.</NOTE> <HI>Heidelberg</HI> is seated on the South-side of the River <HI>Neccar,</HI> between it and a ridge of high Hills, so as it cannot well admit of a modern Fortification, or hope to be extraordinary strong, as being over-looked by the adjacent Mountains: It lies most at length from East to West: It hath been an University since the year 134<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. at which time it was begun by <HI>Rupertus,</HI> Count <HI>Palatine,</HI> and at present is much frequent∣ed.

that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had taken this Town 1620. was carried to <HI>Rome,</HI> and added to the <HI>Vatican,</HI> where I saw it in the year 1664. being pla∣ced upon one side of a very long Gallery belonging to the <HI>Vatican</HI> Li∣brary; and the Duke of <HI>Ʋrbin</HI>'s Library placed on the otherside, over against it: both which made a notable addition to the Papal Library. In this Church and the Church also of <HI>St. Peter,</HI> are divers Monu∣ments of Princes of the <HI>Palatine</HI> Family, and of Learned and Famous Men. The <HI>French</HI> have a Church here, and the present Elector is of the Order of the <HI>Holy-Ghost;</HI> and his Son a Mareschal of <HI>France:</HI> and good <HI>French</HI> and <HI>High-dutch</HI> are both generally spoken here. The <HI>Lutherans</HI> have also a Church in this Town, by the favour of the pre∣sent Elector; although he himself be a <HI>Calvinist:</HI> and to express his generous kindness the higher in this point, the first Stone was laid by himself and his Son; and it is called the <HI>Church of Providence,</HI> accor∣ding to the Elector's Motto, <HI>Dominus Providebit.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the Town-house is a Clock with divers Motions, and when the Clock strikes, the figure of an Old man pulls off his hat, a Cock crows, and shakes his wings, Souldiers fight with one another, and the like. The Prince's Stables for above a hundred Horses are seated upon the River very conveniently, but were fairer formerly, above half thereof having been ruined by the Imperalists; as also divers of the Statues on the out-side of the Castle, which is seated high above the Town.</P>
<P>The present Elector is <HI>Carolus Ludovicus,</HI> Son to the King of <HI>Bohe∣mia, Frederick</HI> the Fifth; he was born in the year 1617. and passed his Youth an Exile from his Fathers Kingdom and Electorate: and at the pacification, at <HI>Prague</HI> 1635. he was excluded from any restitution to be made to him. But at length in the Treaty of <HI>Munster</HI> 1648. he was restored to the lower <HI>Palatinate,</HI> and 1657 returned to the possession of his Fortunes: a highly accomplished Prince, much honoured and beloved by his Subjects. In the year 1650. he married <HI>Charlotta,</HI> Daughter to <HI>William</HI> the Fifth <HI>Landgrave,</HI> and to the famous <HI>Amelia Elizabeth, Landgravess</HI> of <HI>Hassia;</HI> by whom he had the <HI>Char</HI> Prince, or Electoral Prince <HI>Charles,</HI> and a Daughter, the Princess <HI>Charlotta Eli∣zabetha;</HI> but upon some discontent the Princess Electress since returned to her own Friends and Country. This Elector is also Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter, Great Treasurer of the Empire, and together with the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> Vicar of the Empire.</P>
<P>In his Palace or Castle at <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> are divers things remarkable; a very great Tower to be equalled by very few; within which is a Theatre for Comedies. This was formerly called <HI>Trutzkaisar,</HI> or the Tower that bad Defiance, or threatned the Emperor; but since the Restauration of the Elector, there are some Works drawn about it in the figure of a Star, and the olddisobliging Name is by Proclamation forbidden to be continued, and it is at present called <HI>Sternschanz,</HI> or the <HI>Star∣fort.</HI> By it is a handsom Garden; in the Ditch whereof there was then kept a great Bear, and a very large Wolf. The Grotto's and Wa∣ter works are very handsom: they were also making divers others, having the advantage of the side of the Hill to bring down the Water, and to make Grots and Caves in the Rock. Amongst other Fountains, that of the Lions head with a Frog in his Ear, is taken no∣tice of. The Cellars are very large and cool, filled with Vessels of no
<PB N="122" REF="71"/>
ordinary size; yet inconsiderable, if compared to the great Tun kept in a great Building joyning to the Cellars; it was built by this present Elector's Orders, 1664. and goes far beyond any made before: It con∣tains 204 Faiders and odd measure, or about two hundred Tuns: in∣stead of Hoops it is built with large knee Timber, like the ribs of a Ship, which are painted and carved, and have divers Inscriptions upon them, and supported by carved Pedestals. Upon one side of it is a handsom Stair case to ascend to the top of the Vessel; upon the top of which is a Gallery set round with Ballisters, three and forty steps high from the ground.</P>
<P>About an <HI>English</HI> Mile from <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> between the Hills, is a so∣litary place, where three large Streams or Springs gush out of the Moun∣tain, and presently fill five Ponds, have three handsom Cascates or Falls, and after run into the Plain, and are strong enough in a small space to turn four Mills; this is called <HI>Wolfsbrun,</HI> or the <HI>Wolfs Foun∣tain,</HI> from a Princess who formerly retired into a Cave in this desert place, and was here devoured by a <HI>Wolf.</HI></P>
<P>While I was at <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> two <HI>English</HI> men came kindly to me, Mr. <HI>Villers,</HI> and <HI>Timothy Middleton,</HI> belonging to <HI>Lobensfeldt Cloister,</HI> a Convent formerly of the <HI>Jesuites,</HI> but since let out to about an hun∣dred <HI>English,</HI> who left their Country 1661. came up the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and by the permission of the Elector, settled themselves a few Miles from hence, living all together, Men, Women, and Children, in one house; and having a Community of many things: They are of a peculiar Re∣ligion, calling themselves Christian Jews; and one Mr. <HI>Poole,</HI> former∣ly living at <HI>Norwich,</HI> is their Head. They cut not their Beards, and ob∣serve many other Ceremonies and Duties, which they either think themselves obliged to from some Expressions in the old Testament, or from some New Exposition of their Leaders.</P>
<P>From <HI>Heidelburg</HI> I made an excursion, and had a sight of <HI>Spire,</HI> seated in a Plain, on the West-side of the <HI>Rhine;</HI> a place of Antiquity, con∣ceived to be <HI>Ʋrbs Nemetum</HI> of old; a large place and populous. The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> in the <HI>German</HI> Wars demolished the Works about it, not willing to spare so great a number of his Souldiers as was re∣quired to Garrison it, and make it good. It is an Episcopal See under the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Mentz:</HI> there are many fair Houses in it, divers Churches, and a fair Cathedral, with four large Towers. The <HI>Romanists,</HI> the <HI>Lutherans</HI> and <HI>Calvinists</HI> preach in it at several hours. It is the more populous, and filled with people of good quality, by reason of the concourse of persons from other parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> for the decision of Law Suits: For here the Imperial Chamber is held, and many differences which arise in the Empire are determined, and the Electors and other Princes, in some Tryals at Law, may be called hither. It is a settled Court, which <HI>Maximilian</HI> the First, for the better ease of all persons, placed first at <HI>Worms,</HI> and not long after it was fixed at <HI>Spire,</HI> from whence it cannot be now remo∣ved, but by the consent of all the Estates. Things Cognoscible in this Court are determined by an Imperial Judge, and sealed with the Em∣perours Arms, so that there lies no appeal unto the Emperor.</P>
<P>Another day I went to <HI>Manheim,</HI> formerly a Village, seated at the Confluence of the <HI>Rhine</HI> and <HI>Neccar;</HI> but walled about by the Elector <HI>Frederick</HI> the Fourth, and since is much encreased; all the Streets
<PB N="123" REF="71"/>
being large and uniform, and a Noble Cittadel built; within which, over against the Gate, the Elector designs a Palace, the Model of which I saw: and at present, on the right hand, there are three Pavilions of Lodgings: in one of which lodges the Elector <HI>Palatine;</HI> in another the Prince his Son; and in the third the Princess his Daughter: behind these there is a handsome Garden and Lodgings for <HI>Degen Felderen,</HI> the <HI>Churfursts</HI> Mistress. Here are some good Pictures, as a Head of <HI>Hans Holben,</HI> and a Landskip with the Story of the Union of the <HI>Swissers.</HI> The Bridge over the Moat of the Cittadel into the Town, is also remarkable, as having six Draw-bridges upon it, three great ones, and three small ones on the side. There are Palisado's all along the bottom, in the middle of the Ditch, and without upon the <HI>Espla∣nade.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Heidelberg</HI> I travelled to <HI>Nurnberg</HI> in the Company of Cap∣tain <HI>Wagenseyl,</HI> who had been in the <HI>Polish</HI> and <HI>Hungarian</HI> Wars, and was employed a little before in blowing up the Castle of <HI>Launsteyn,</HI> be∣longing to the Elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> to prevent its surprisal by the Duke of <HI>Lorrain.</HI> He was then employed to raise a Company at <HI>Nurnberg,</HI> for the Service of the Elector <HI>Palatine.</HI> I had a good advantage in my Jour∣ney by his Company; for he travelled with Authority, and was a ge∣nerous, knowing, and courteous person.</P>
<P>The first day we travelled near to the <HI>Neccar,</HI> in stony and rocky way; and it being dark before we came to <HI>Mospach,</HI> the Peasants con∣ducted us from Village to Village with bundles of lighted Straw.</P>
<P>The next day we came to <HI>Poxberg,</HI> where there is an old Castle, and in the afternoon reached <HI>Morkenthal,</HI> or <HI>Mergetheim,</HI> the Seat of the Grand Master of the <HI>Herrhn Deutchern,</HI> or the <HI>Teutonick Order.</HI> The Town is well built, hath a fair <HI>Piazza,</HI> with a large Fountain in it, and a Statue of one of the Grand Masters, with a long <HI>Corridore</HI> from his Palace. This Order hath been of great Fame, and hath had large Pos∣sessions, as may be seen in the exact Account of the <HI>Teutonick Knights</HI> of <HI>Prussia,</HI> made out from the best Authors, by my worthy honoured Friend Mr. <HI>Ashmole,</HI> in his Noble Description of the Order of the Gar∣ter; and as <HI>Lewis du May,</HI> Counsellor unto the Duke of <HI>Wirtenberg,</HI> hath set it down. <HI>For the Knights Templers and of St.</HI> John, <HI>having fought prosperously against the Infidels, raised an Emulation in some</HI> Ger∣man <HI>Gentlemen, who waited upon the Emperor</HI> Frederick <HI>the First, in his Expedition to the</HI> Holy Land, <HI>to take the</HI> Croisado. <HI>And because they were installed in the Church and Hospital of St.</HI> Mary <HI>at</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>they were called,</HI> Marianites. <HI>Their Order differed nothing from those above-mentioned, but in the form and colour of their Cross, and was ap∣proved by Pope</HI> Celestin <HI>the Third. Afterwards when</HI> Jerusalem <HI>was taken by</HI> Saladin, <HI>those Knights betook themselves to</HI> Ptolemais, <HI>from whence the Emperor</HI> Frederick <HI>the Second, sent them back into</HI> Germany, <HI>and employed them against the</HI> Prussians <HI>and</HI> Livonians, <HI>who at that time were still Pagans. But by the Valour and Piety of those Knights, their Souls were brought into subjection to Christ, and their Bodies to the Or∣der which began that War in the year</HI> 1220. <HI>a little while after these Knights found themselves Masters of a Country of very large Extent, which obeyed the Order, till the year</HI> 1525. <HI>at which time</HI> Sigismond, <HI>King of</HI> Poland, <HI>gave the investiture of</HI> Prussia <HI>unto</HI> Albert <HI>Marquess of</HI> Brandenburg. <HI>In the year</HI> 1563. <HI>the Great Master became Secular a∣gain,</HI>
<PB N="124" REF="72"/>
<HI>and took a part of the Lands subject to the Order, with the name of Duke of</HI> Curland. <HI>And</HI> Livonia <HI>having been the Subject and Theatre of many Wars between the</HI> Polanders, Muscovites, <HI>and</HI> Swedes; <HI>these last did at length become Masters of it, and have it in possession still. So that there is no more remaining of the</HI> Teutonick Order, <HI>but some Comman∣deries scattered here and there in</HI> Germany. <HI>And the Great Master hath his Seat and Residence at</HI> Mergenthal.</P>
<P>They wear on a white Matle a plain black Cross. The Dignity of Grand Master is generally held by some Great and Honourable Per∣son; and in the Great Assembly he takes place of al Bishops. The present is the Baron of <HI>Amring;</HI> and the Grand Master before him was <HI>Leopold William,</HI> only Brother to the Emperor <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Third.</P>
<P>From hence we travelled to <HI>Lauterbach,</HI> near which we passed through a Wood, and found a Noble Church upon the top of a high Hill, which being much frequented by Pilgrims, they have made hand∣some stone Stairs from the bottom to the top: then to <HI>Rotenburg,</HI> and lodged at <HI>Burgperner,</HI> and the next day by <HI>Schantzbach</HI> we came to <HI>Nu∣renberg. Rotenburg</HI> is an Imperial City, which some have likened unto <HI>Jerusalem</HI> for its Situation upon hilly places and many Turrets in it. It is Situated near the head of the River <HI>Tauber,</HI> which may be accounted the second River of <HI>Franconia,</HI> passing by <HI>Rottingen, Lan∣der,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nurenberg.</NOTE> and <HI>Werthaim,</HI> where it runs into the <HI>Main.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nurenberg</HI> is the fairest City that I saw in <HI>Germany;</HI> the Houses most of them of Free-stone, very high; and divers of them painted on the outside, and adorned with gilded Balls on the top; many are of six or seven Stories high. <HI>Der Herr Peller</HI> hath one of the fairest. The City is very populous and full of Trade, although it stands in a barren Country, and wants a Navigable River. The three best Churches are the <HI>Hospital Church,</HI> lately built very fair; St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> which is very large, with two high Steeples in the Front; and St. <HI>Sebald</HI> the best of the three. The Body of St. <HI>Sebald</HI> being laid upon a Cart drawn with Oxen, in that place where the Oxen stood still, they buried the Body, and erected this Church in his Memory. In this Church is a Crucisix of Wood, very well carved, and esteemed at a high rate. The Crucisix without the Church is very great, and of a black colour: and some fancy that the <HI>Raht Herrn,</HI> or Magistrates of the Town, have reposited a Treasure within it. The Pulpit is well carved and gilded, and the whole Church so stately, that it may pass in the first rank of <HI>Lutheran</HI> Churches; that Religion being here practised in its splendour. The Priest every morning reads the Scripture to the people for half an hour, or preaches a Sermon. The Town-house is well worth the seeing: In it the Hall is spacious, as also the Chambers, and furnished with good Pictures, and Stoves well gilded and painted with white and gold, green and gold, dark coloured and gold, and the like. There is one Picture of most of the Great Persons in <HI>Germany</HI> entertained in the Great Hall; another of the three Brothers of <HI>Saxony;</HI> one of an Elephant as big as the life; a piece of St. <HI>John</HI> and St. <HI>Mark,</HI> and another of St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Paul,</HI> both by <HI>Albert Durer:</HI> but the most rare piece is that of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> by the same Master, with this Inscription.</P>
<P><Q><L>Albertus Durer Almang faciebat post Virginis partum, <HI>1507.</HI></L></Q>
<PB N="125" REF="72"/>
Another excellent one is that of St. <HI>Luke</HI> drawing the Picture of our Saviour and the blessed Virgin: Over the Gate at the entrance of the Shambles is a large Oxe carved in Wood, and painted over, with this Inscription:
<Q><L>Omnia habent ortus suaque incrementa, sed ecce</L>
<L>Quem cernis, nunquam Bos fuit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ic, Vitulus.</L></Q>
The Castle stand upon a high Hill, from whence the Town makes a handsome show: In it are observable a very deep well, the Empe∣rors Chappel, his Picture, and the Pictures of the Electors; good Night pieces; and one of a man behind a white Curtain transparent, very well expressed. The Armour of <HI>Hebbele van Gailinghen</HI> the great Sor∣cerer is here shown; and in the Wall of the Castle the marks of his Horses feet, when he leaped from thence over the <HI>Town ditch.</HI></P>
<P>The new Fountain was not then finished; but the Statua's in Brass made for it were excellent; the Sea Horses large, the Sea-Nymphs much bigger than the life; and <HI>N ptune,</HI> who was to stand on the top, is above three yards and a halfhigh. When I came first into this place, I was not a little surprized to behold the fairness of the Houses, hand∣some Streets, different Habits, industrious People, and neatness in all things, more than I had observed in <HI>German</HI> Cities before; and no place hath greater number of curious Artificers in Steel, Brass, Ivory, Wood, wherein they work at an extraordinary cheap rate; and there are Officers to inspect and enquire into the works of Artificers, that they be true, perfect and without fraud: they make strong and hand∣some Clock-work. The King of <HI>Poland</HI> presented the Grand Seignior with a very noble Clock, who took so much delight in it, that when it required some mending (the <HI>Turks</HI> being ignorant in Clock-work) he sent it from <HI>Adrianople</HI> as far as <HI>Nurenburg</HI> to be set in order a∣gain.</P>
<P><HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> was more magnificently received and entertained in this City, than in any other of <HI>Germany;</HI> which so incensed <HI>Wallenst<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yn,</HI> that he afterwards encamped before their Town, and did great spoil upon their Territories: But the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> marched thither towards their Relief, and from thence towards <HI>Lutzen,</HI> where in a bloody Battel he lost his life.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Pegnitz</HI> runnes through <HI>Nurnberg,</HI> and hath divers Stone Bridges over it; and below the Town, joyning with the River <HI>Red∣nitz,</HI> runs into the River <HI>Main</HI> at <HI>Bamberg;</HI> and the <HI>Main</HI> runs at last into the <HI>Rhine.</HI> The <HI>Reduitz</HI> arises at <HI>Weissenberg,</HI> and is not far from the River <HI>Altmul,</HI> which runs into the <HI>Danube,</HI> towards <HI>Regens<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urg.</HI> Upon this convenience, <HI>Charles</HI> the great designed to make a Communication of passage between the <HI>Danube</HI> and the <HI>Rhine;</HI> and made a <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> thirty paces abroad between the <HI>Rednitz</HI> and the <HI>Altmul,</HI> to joyn those Streams for the commodity of Passage by Boat; but after he had prooceeded two <HI>German</HI> miles in this work, Boggs, Rains, and his warlike Diversions made him give over that noble De∣sign, whereby there might have been a Commerce by water, from the <HI>Low C un ries</HI> to <HI>Vienna,</HI> and even unto the <HI>Euxine Sea.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Roman</HI> Lieutenant in <HI>Nero</HI>'s time, had a desire to unite the Ri∣ver <HI>Soane</HI> and the <HI>Mosella;</HI> and to make a passage between the <HI>Medi∣terranean</HI>
<PB N="126" REF="73"/>
and the <HI>German</HI> Ocean; having been at the mouth of the <HI>Mosella</HI> by <HI>Coblentz,</HI> and passed from <HI>Chaalon</HI> upon the soft and noble River <HI>Araris</HI> or <HI>Soane</HI> unto <HI>Lyon,</HI> I cannot but think these very goodly Streams, and fit for such a purpose. The present King of <HI>France</HI> hath a design to unite the River <HI>Aude</HI> with the <HI>Ga∣ronne,</HI> and so to have a passage by Boat from the <HI>Mediterranean Sea</HI> by <HI>Tholouse</HI> and <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> into the Ocean. When I travelled in those parts, viewing the Country well, I thought it would be a difficult work, and so it proves: but the King hath proceeded already very far therein.</P>
<P>About four Leagues from <HI>Nurnberg</HI> lies <HI>Altdorff,</HI> belonging unto it, made an University in the year 1623. containing when I was there, about 150 Scholars. The Physick Garden is handsome, and well stocked with Plants, to the number of two thousand. Dr <HI>Hoffman</HI> the <HI>Botanick</HI> and <HI>Anatomick Professour,</HI> shew'd me many of the most rare of them; and presented me divers. The <HI>Anatomy</HI> School is not large; yet the only one in those parts of <HI>Germany:</HI> And they have divers curiosities preserved in it, as the <HI>Skeleton</HI> of a Hart, of a Horse, of a Man, of a Bear bigger than a Horse: And some Pictures, as one of a <HI>Ninivite,</HI> and another of <HI>Moses,</HI> which they take to be Ancient. Dr. <HI>Wagenseyl,</HI> Professour of Law and History, brother to Captain <HI>Wagenseyl,</HI> who travelled with me from <HI>Heidellerg,</HI> invited us to lodge at his House, and shew'd me his Library, and all his Rareties and Coyns, whereof he hath a good Collection, having lived in most places of <HI>Europe,</HI> and speaks many Languages well; he gave me a piec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the first money that was coined in <HI>Germany.</HI> In the University <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣brary I saw a fair <HI>Hortus Eystetensis,</HI> and <HI>Toungerman</HI>'s Collection of Plants by his own hand.</P>
<P>At <HI>Nurnberg</HI> I met with the Son and the Secretary to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ambassador in <HI>Turky,</HI> who had travelled hither over-land from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>stantinople</HI> in their return into the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> travelling in <HI>Greek</HI> Habits.</P>
<P>From hence I went to <HI>Newmark,</HI> a good Town in the upper <HI>Palati∣nate</HI> belonging to the Duke of <HI>Barvaria,</HI> and the next day through <HI>Heinmaw,</HI> subject to the Duke of <HI>Newberg,</HI> to <HI>Regensburg.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ratisbona, Regensburg, Augusta Tiberli, Colonia Qua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tanorum,</HI> the chief place of the <HI>Ramans</HI> in this limit of the Empire, where the fourth <HI>Italick</HI> Legion had a constant station; was made a Colony by <HI>Tiberi∣us</HI> in the year, as some conceive, of the Passion of our Saviour. It was much augmented and adorned by the Emperour <HI>Arnulphus,</HI> who had a great affection for this place, so pleasantly seated, and in a good Coun∣try. Here the River <HI>Regen</HI> runs into the <HI>Danube;</HI> from whence it was called <HI>Regensburg.</HI> There are two Bridges, one of wood below the Town, and another Bridge of stone of about fifteen Arches; which is the fairest stone Bridge over the <HI>Danube.</HI> It is an Imperial City, but not without some acknowledgement to the Duke of <HI>Bavaria:</HI> And al∣though it be strongly fortified, yet it was taken by the <HI>Swedes</HI> in the <HI>German</HI> wars. There are many fair buildings in it, both private and publick; and though I am not able to confirm what some report, that there as aremany Churches and Chappels in this City, as there are days in the year; yet are there many fair Churches and Convents: As the Ca∣thedral of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> on the South-side of which is the Picture of St. <HI>Peter</HI>
<PB N="127" REF="73"/>
in a ship; andon the North another of the Apostles first Mission. In the <HI>Piazza</HI> stands a neat little Church, the Convent of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> founded by St. <HI>Wolfgangus,</HI> Bishop of this place, the Convent of St. <HI>Eme∣rammus</HI> Bishop of <HI>Ratisbone,</HI> a Saint of great Veneration here, though<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rutisbone.</NOTE> but of little mention or name in other parts. The name of <HI>Albertus Magnus,</HI> Bishop of this place, hath also added unto the Fame of <HI>Regensburg.</HI></P>
<P>But that which chiefly promotes its lustre, is the General Diet or Parliament, which is often held in this City, and is not to be called in any part out of <HI>Germany;</HI> and the place is not unfit for the accommo∣dation of such a noble Convention, as are the Estates of <HI>Germany.</HI> The Vice-Marshal takes care to provide Lodgings respectively to their persons▪ and sees that all things be brought hither, and at a just price; that the Hall or Place of Assembly be furnished and adorned suitably to the dignity of the Persons convened, and hath an especial eye and re∣gard towards the Publick safety. By this Convention the great Con∣cerns of <HI>Germany</HI> are much secured, and their peace and quiet Establish∣ed. Wherein <HI>Germany</HI> seems to have a better advantage than <HI>Italy;</HI> For <HI>Italy</HI> being likewise divided into many Dominions and Principalities hath no Common Diet or Great Council, whereby to proceed for their Publick safety: Which makes them often so divided in their common Concerns in times of Danger, and when they most need a joynt Com∣bination.</P>
<P>I entred the notable River <HI>Danubius</HI> at this place, which hath al∣ready run a good course, and passed by many fair Towns or Cities; as the large City of <HI>Ʋlme</HI> in <HI>Swabenland,</HI> where it begins to be Na∣vigable; as also <HI>Donawert, Neuburg,</HI> and <HI>Ingolstadt,</HI> and hath already received the considerable River of <HI>Licus</HI> or <HI>Leck</HI> whereby the Com∣modities of that great trading City of <HI>Augsberg,</HI> are brought into it. When I first embarked at <HI>Regensburg,</HI> I thought I might have taken leave of the <HI>Danube</HI> not far below <HI>Vienna,</HI> but an opportunity made me see this great Stream beyond <HI>Belgrade,</HI> as I have declared in another Account of my Travels.</P>
<P>The first day we passed by <HI>Thonawsteyn,</HI> where there is a Castle seated upon a high Rock, and came to <HI>Pfeter</HI> or <HI>Vetera Castra</HI> of old, now but an ordinary place. The Boats upon the <HI>Danube</HI> are generally painted black and white, are flat bottom'd, and broad at the Head and Stern; there is a Chamber built in the middle; and the Rudder is ve∣ry large, to be able to command the Boat where the River is rapid, and of a Swift Course.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Straubing.</NOTE> The next day we came to <HI>Straubing,</HI> a handsome walled Town, be∣longing to the Duke of <HI>Bavaria;</HI> the Streets are streight; and there is a Tower in the Market-place, painted all over with green and gold colour: There is also a Bridge of wood over the <HI>Danube.</HI> We passed by <HI>Swartz</HI> in the Afternoon, where the Church is seated upon a Hill, and is frequented by Pilgrims, and lodged at <HI>Deckendorff,</HI> where there is another Bridge. Near this Town comes into the <HI>Danube</HI> that con∣siderable River <HI>Iser,</HI> or <HI>Isara,</HI> having passed by divers considerable Towns; as <HI>Landshut, Frising,</HI> and <HI>Müchen,</HI> the Seat of <HI>Ferdinandus Maria,</HI> Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> Great Steward of the Empire, and at pre∣sent the first of the Secular Electors, and he is to take place immedi∣ately after the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> it being to concluded on at the Treaty of <HI>Munster,</HI> where <HI>Maximilian</HI> Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> was allowed
<PB N="128" REF="74"/>
to hold the Electorship, which was confirmed upon him by the Empe∣ror <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Second, when he excluded <HI>Frederick</HI> the Fifth, Count <HI>Palatine,</HI> and in lieu hereof there was an eight Electorship erected for the <HI>Palatinate</HI> Family, who also, if the <HI>Bavarian</HI> branch doth fail, are to re-enter into their ancient Electorship and the other newly erected is to be abolished.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday, November</HI> the fifteenth, we came by <HI>Wilshoven</HI> to <HI>Passaw, Patavia,</HI> or <HI>Boiodurum,</HI> a long and noble City in the lower <HI>Bavaria,</HI> or <HI>Bayern,</HI> made up of three Towns, <HI>Iltzstadt Passaw,</HI> and <HI>Innstadt,</HI> at the concurrence of the River <HI>Inn▪</HI> the <HI>Danube,</HI> and the <HI>jltz.</HI> As Towns are commonly of great Antiquity which are built at the Con∣fluence of great Rivers, for the Strength of the Situation and conveni∣ence of Commerce; so is this accounted ancient, as being a <HI>Roman</HI> Co∣lony, and the place of the <HI>Castra Batava</HI> in old time.</P>
<P>The Church of St. <HI>Stephen</HI> is stately, besides other fair Churches. The Bishop, who is Lord of the City, hath a strong Palace upon a Hill; his Revenues are large, and besides what he possesses hereabouts, he hath the tenth part of the notable great Lead-Mine at <HI>Bleyberg</HI> in <HI>Ca∣rinthia.</HI> This place had lately suffered much by fire; but a good part was rebuilt, and very fairly after the <HI>Italian</HI> manner: So that this may well be reckoned as one of the ten considerable Cities, which are upon the <HI>Danube,</HI> accounting from <HI>Ʋlme</HI> unto <HI>Belgrade,</HI> as <HI>Ʋlme, Ingolstadt, Ratisbone, Passaw, Lintz, Vienna, Presburg, Strigonium, Buda, Belgrade;</HI> all which from <HI>Ratisbone</HI> I had the opportunity to see before the end of my Journey. Near to a Wall over against the great Church at <HI>Passaw,</HI> which was then repairing, I saw a vast Head cut in stone, the Mouth whereof was two spans wide, and the rest proportionable. The River <HI>Iltz,</HI> which runs in here from the North, is considerable for the Pearls which are found in it; and the noble River <HI>Inne</HI> or <HI>Oenus,</HI> from the South, is the greatest River which hath yet entred the <HI>Danube;</HI> having passed by <HI>Insbrug,</HI> and taken in the River <HI>Saltz,</HI> upon which stands <HI>Saltzburg;</HI> and arising in the <HI>Alpes</HI> in such a high Country as <HI>Tirolis,</HI> it runs in here with a great force, and adds much unto the swiftness of the <HI>Danube.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the Sixteenth we came to <HI>Lintz,</HI> the chief City in the higher<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lintz.</NOTE> <HI>Austria,</HI> not very great, but as neat and handsome a City as most in <HI>Germany.</HI> There is in it a very great Market-place, with never a bad House in it, the whole Town built of a very white Free-stone; and the Castle upon the Hill is of Mordern Building, and very large. There is also a Bridge over the <HI>Danube.</HI> The Imperial Forces rendezvoused here when <HI>Solyman</HI> came to <HI>Vienna.</HI> This was also besieged by the Peasants of <HI>Austria</HI> in the time of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Second; they having got a Bo∣dy together of Forty thousand men, and many pieces of Ordnance, but were stoutly repulsed after many Assaults, and at last overcome by <HI>Pa∣penheim.</HI> Not far below <HI>Lintz</HI> the River <HI>Draun</HI> enters the <HI>Danube;</HI> this comes from the <HI>Gemundner Sea,</HI> or <HI>Lacus Felicis,</HI> passing by <HI>Lampack, Weltz,</HI> and other Towns, and hath a noted Cataract or Fall of Waters.</P>

<P>The next day we passed by <HI>Ens, Anisia,</HI> upon the River <HI>Anisius,</HI> or <HI>Onasus,</HI> which taking its original in the Borders of <HI>Saltzburgland</HI> runs into the <HI>Danube,</HI> and divides the higher from the lower <HI>Austria,</HI> having received into it self the River <HI>Saltza,</HI> upon which stands <HI>Cell,</HI> or <HI>Maria Cell,</HI> a place of the greatest Pilgrimage in <HI>Austria.</HI> Near this Town are many <HI>Roman</HI> Coyns and Antiquities found, and <HI>Lauriacum</HI> stood of old, a <HI>Roman</HI> Garrison, and afterwards a Biship's See: we came to a Village on the North shoar of the <HI>Danube,</HI> called <HI>Greim,</HI> where the <HI>Graff von Leichtensteyn</HI> hath a House. A little below this are two dangerous passages in the River; the one called the <HI>Strudel,</HI> where the River running amongst vast Rocks, some under water, and some above, the waves are broken with great force, and the Current is rapid, foaming, and troublesome; and some skill is required to pass between the Ledges of Rocks which are under water, and when the water is
<PB N="130" REF="75"/>
low the passage is very difficult. The other is the <HI>Wurbel,</HI> or a kind of Whirlpool, where the water turns about with great force, being hindred in its direct Course by a great Rock. Upon the top of a high craggy Rock stands a large Cross, and at the foot a little Church dedicated to St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> who is Patron of this dangerous place, and is believed to take peculiar care of such as pass this way, and therefore a little Boat comes to you as soon as you are out of danger, and re∣cieves what Acknowledgment you please, or what perhaps you may have promised to give, when you were in some fear. This night we lodged at <HI>Ips, Ipsium,</HI> or <HI>Ibissa,</HI> a Town on the South-side of the <HI>Danube:</HI> over against it lies <HI>Besenbeug,</HI> or <HI>Ʋsbium Pt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ei.</HI> Two <HI>German</HI> miles below <HI>Ips</HI> stands <HI>Pechlarn,</HI> conceived to be <HI>Arlape</HI> in former times; and here the River <HI>Erlaph</HI> enters the <HI>Danube:</HI> A mile and a half below this lies <HI>Melcke, Nomale,</HI> or <HI>Mea dialecta,</HI> in former days the Seat of the Marquesses of <HI>Austria,</HI> until St. <HI>Leopold</HI> removed to <HI>Kalenberg,</HI> and his Successours to <HI>Vienna.</HI> The Town lies at length upon the South-side of the River; but the noble Cloister of <HI>Benedictines,</HI> which takes place of any other in <HI>Austria,</HI> stands upon a Hill which over-looks the Town, the River, and the Country about; is richly endowed, and remarkable for the Monuments of many great Persons, and the Tomb of St. <HI>Colman,</HI> much honoured in these parts. We dined at <HI>Steyn,</HI> where there is a Bridge over the <HI>Danube.</HI> Near to this lies <HI>Crembs,</HI> another walled Town; and over the water <HI>Mautern;</HI> and not far from it the rich Convent of <HI>Ketwein;</HI> After this the River <HI>Traisn,</HI> or <HI>Tragisama,</HI> comes in from the South. Having passed by the noted Town St. <HI>Pold,</HI> or St. <HI>Hippolitus,</HI> we lodged this Night at St. <HI>Eldorff,</HI> and the next day passed by <HI>Thuln, Stockerau,</HI> and <HI>Cloistor Neuburg,</HI> to <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE DESCRIPTION OF VIENNA.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">V</SEG>IENNA,</HI> or <HI>Wien,</HI> which the <HI>Turks</HI> call <HI>Beach,</HI> is the Chief City of <HI>Austria,</HI> in the Latitude of forty eight Degrees, twenty Minutes, not much differing from the Latitude of <HI>Paris.</HI> The old Seat of the Dukes of <HI>Austria,</HI> and for a long time of the Empe∣rors of <HI>Germany.</HI> According to ancient account it stands in <HI>Pannonia superior,</HI> the Bounds of <HI>Pannonia</HI> extend∣ing unto <HI>Kalemberg,</HI> or <HI>Mons Cetius,</HI> five or six Miles Westward of <HI>Vienna;</HI> beyond which still Westward all that lies between that Hill and the great River <HI>Oenus,</HI> or <HI>Inne,</HI> which runs into the <HI>Danube</HI> at <HI>Pas∣saw,</HI> or <HI>Castra Batava,</HI> was anciently called <HI>Nori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um.</HI></P>
<P>It was an ancient place of Habitation in the time of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and called <HI>Vindobona,</HI> as the Learned <HI>Petrus Lambecius</HI> hath at large declared, where the <HI>Classis Istrica</HI> sometimes lay, and the tenth <HI>Ger∣man Legion</HI> had its station; all this shoar or side of the <HI>Danube</HI> being fa∣mous for the Actions of <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors against the <HI>Marcomanni</HI> and <HI>Quadi,</HI> who possessed the Country on the other side of the River, and especially for the Wars of <HI>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Philosophus,</HI> who notably defeated those Nations, and who, as <HI>Aurelius Vic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or</HI> (who was Governor of <HI>Sirmium</HI> in <HI>Pannonia in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erior,</HI> in the time of <HI>Constan∣tius)</HI> affirms, fell sick at <HI>Carnuntum,</HI> now <HI>Petronel,</HI> and died at <HI>Vindobona,</HI> now <HI>Vienna.</HI> And to confirm the Antiquity hereof, besides what <HI>Wolfgangus Lazius</HI> hath delivered, not many years since some Antiquities were found. For in the year 1662. when a Wall was dig∣ged up near▪ the old Palace, the Workmen digging still on below the Foundation, found a Stone Trough or Coffin, containing hard Earth and Bones, with a small Gold Coyn, a Glass Urn enclosed in a Brass one, an Iron Knife like a <HI>Sicespita,</HI> or Knife used about Sacrifices, a lit∣tle Roll or Scroll of pure Gold, shut up with a Golden cover at both ends, wherein was an Inscription in strange Characters: Not far from the Sepulchral Monument were found a Head in Brass, a Brazen <HI>Pate∣ra,</HI> Lamps, Lachrymatories, and other Vessels, and a Copper Coyn of <HI>Antoninus Caracalla.</HI> The writing in the Golden Scroll, which no man could read, was conceived by the Learned <HI>Lambecius</HI> to be the old <HI>Pannonian</HI> Character, and that this might be the Monument of some <HI>Pannonian</HI> Priest in the days of <HI>Caracalla,</HI> who, as good Authors deliver, spent some time about these parts.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="76"/>
It is seated on the South-side of the <HI>Danube,</HI> on the <HI>ripa Romana,</HI> that side nearest to <HI>Rome,</HI> and many <HI>Roman</HI> Colonies, according to the usual position of <HI>Roman</HI> Stations, both upon this River and the <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine,</HI> as may be exemplified in <HI>Colen, Bonna, Andarnach, Coblentz, Ments, Wormes, Spier,</HI> and <HI>Strasburg.</HI> And in like manner in the old <HI>Roman</HI> Stations, on the South or <HI>Roman</HI> side of the <HI>Danube,</HI> which were in no small number in or near the <HI>Austrian</HI> shoar, as <HI>Carnuntum,</HI> or <HI>Petronel, Vischmund,</HI> or <HI>Aquinoctium, Ebersdorff,</HI> or <HI>Ala Nova, Melck,</HI> or <HI>Nc∣male, Arlape,</HI> or <HI>Pechlarne, Lentia,</HI> or <HI>Lintz;</HI> for hereby they better secured their Conquests, and hindred the incursions of the Barbarians before them.</P>
<P>It is not seated upon the main stream of the <HI>Danube,</HI> but by a branch thereof; for the River running through a low Country; it is divided into several Streams, and makes many Islands. A small River named <HI>Wien</HI> runs by the East part of this City, and enters the <HI>Danube,</HI> below it, which upon floods doth often much hurt, yet sometimes low and very shallow, so as I have stepped over it; some will have it to give the Name unto this City: it divides part of the Suburbs from it, and hath divers Bridges over it. For that we may have a distinct appre∣hension of <HI>Vienna,</HI> we must consider the City and Suburbs thereof; the Suburbs are very great, and not without fair Houses, Gardens, Walks, and all Accommodations at large.</P>
<P>The City it self is that walled and fortified part, designed not only for convenience of Habitation, but also to sustain a Siege, or any At∣tack from the <HI>Turk,</HI> and is now separated from the Suburbs by a fair <HI>Esplanade,</HI> or open Ground, above a Musket shot over. The Houses near the wall were pulled down since the last Fortification in the <HI>Turkish</HI> war, when they were in some fear that the <HI>Turkish</HI> Forces about <HI>Gran</HI> and <HI>New-husel,</HI> would move towards them. It is fortified <HI>a la moder∣na,</HI> with ten Bastions towards the Land, and a very deep Ditch, into which they can let the <HI>Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ube:</HI> and with two other Bastions towards the water, on that part of the River which lies on the North-side of the Town. These two latter are called the Works of Gonzaga. The Bastions are large; upon one of them I saw Count <HI>Souches</HI> muster a good part of the Militia of the City. The Ditch is large and very deep, into which although they can let in the River, yet it is commonly kept dry, lest they might incommode their deep Cellars. There are two walls, the one old and inward, little considerable at present, built at first with the ransom of our King <HI>Richard</HI> the First, who in his return from the Holy War, was detained Prisoner by the Duke of <HI>Austria</HI> upon the 20<HI>th</HI> of <HI>December,</HI> 1192. The <HI>Austrians</HI> pretending they had received some affront from the King at <HI>Joppa,</HI> and that he had taken down the Ensign and Banner of Duke <HI>Leopold</HI> in a contemptuous way. The other outward of a great breadth, made of Earth, and faced with Brick, edged with Free-stone, so well built, as to render this City one of the most considerable fortified places in <HI>Europe.</HI> The <HI>Esplanade</HI> gently descends from the Town for three hundred Paces; there are very few Outworks.</P>
<P>It is very uncertain who was the first Builder of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and after it had been long built it ran to decay again for Four hundred years toge∣ther, till <HI>Henry</HI> the First, Duke of <HI>Austria,</HI> in the year 1158. did much repair it; and the ransom afterwards of King <HI>Richard</HI> beautified it.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="76"/>
The whole compass, taking in the Suburbs, makes a very large Cir∣cuit, but the City it self, which is walled in, may be about three miles in Circumference, and is exceeding populous, as full of People, for the bigness of the place, as most of the great Cities. And I could not but take delight to behold so many Nations in it, as <HI>Turks, Tartars, Grae∣cians, Transylvanians, Sclavonians, Hungarians, Croatians, Spaniards, Italians, French, Germans, Polanders,</HI> &amp;c. all in their proper Habits.</P>
<P>The chief Gates are six: 1. <HI>Stubnthor,</HI> or the <HI>Stuben Gate</HI> towards the East. 2. <HI>Karnterthor,</HI> or the <HI>Gate of Carinthia</HI> towards the South. 3. <HI>Burg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hor,</HI> the <HI>Town Gate,</HI> or <HI>Castle Gate.</HI> 4. <HI>Schottenthor,</HI> or the <HI>Scotch Gate.</HI> 5. <HI>Newthor,</HI> or the <HI>Neagate;</HI> these two last towards the West: And 6. the <HI>Gate of the red Tower</HI> towards the North, which leads unto the Bridge over the <HI>Danube:</HI> and towards the water-side there is also a Port by the Emperor's palace, and a Cloyster or Nunne∣ry in the Town hath the Name of a Port called <HI>Himmel port,</HI> or the <HI>Gate of Heaven.</HI> The five first of these Gates are vaulted and arched with long passages through the Town-wall, and have good Bridges of Wood, with Draw-bridges to pass over the Town ditch: The sixth is under a Tower, and leads to the Bridges of the <HI>Danube:</HI> For that River runs here in a flat low Country, divides its streams, so that to pass it quite over, there are at present seven long Bridges made up of many thousand Trees laid one by another, after their way of making Bridges. There is also a Bridge within the City of <HI>Vienna,</HI> called the <HI>Hochbrug,</HI> or <HI>High-bridge,</HI> which is made by the crossing of two Streets at equal Angles; the ground of one street being as high as the tops of the Houses of the other, so th t to continue it, they were forced to build a Bridge or Arch in the <HI>Lower street,</HI> to let the upper to pass over it.</P>
<P>The City is fairly built of stone, and well paved; many Houses are of six stories high; they are somewhat flat roofed after the <HI>Italian</HI> way; the Streets are not narrow, but the compass of ground will not admit them to be very broad; and their Buildings are remarkable both above and below ground; their Cellars are very deep. To satisfie my curiosity, I went into some of them, and found four Cellars one under another; they were arched, and had two pair of Stairs to descend into them. Some have an open space in the middle of each roof, to let the Air out of one Cellar into another, and from the lowest an <HI>adit</HI> or <HI>tu∣be</HI> unto the top, to let the Air in and out from the street, somewhat af∣ter the manner of the Mines.</P>
<P><HI>Aenaeas Sylvius,</HI> about two hundred years since, commending the City of <HI>Nurnburg,</HI> among other expressions lets fall this: <HI>Cuperent Sco∣torum Reges</HI> tam <HI>egregiè quam mediocres Cives</HI> Norinbergenses <HI>habitare.</HI> The Kings of the <HI>Scots</HI> would be content to dwell so well as the mid∣dle sorts of Citizens of <HI>Nurnburg.</HI> I must confess, when I first entred <HI>Nurnburg,</HI> I was much surprized to see such a noble, large, spruce, rich, and well built City: but <HI>Vienna</HI> doth also deserve the commendation which he affords it: <HI>Ʋbi Palatia digna Regibus, &amp; Templa quae mira∣ri</HI> Italia <HI>possit.</HI> Where there are Palaces fit for Kings, and Churches which <HI>Italy</HI> may admire. And this being spoken so long ago, is now better verified of it.</P>
<P>The Imperial Palace is very Noble, Substantial, and Princely furnish∣ed, consisting chiefly of two Courts; the one very large, the other les∣ser,
<PB N="134" REF="77"/>
wherein the Emperor lodges. At the Entrance over the Gate, are set in Capitals Letters the five Vowels, <HI>A, E, I, O, Ʋ;</HI> whereof the Phancies of men make various interpretations. That which was told me, was this, <HI>Austriae est imperare Orli Ʋniverso;</HI> or, <HI>Alles Erdreich Ist Osterreich Ʋnterthan; i. e.</HI> All the World is subject to <HI>Austria.</HI> Al∣though I could hardly believe this was the first intended meaning. Be∣sides these two Courts is another small one, where some of the Pages lodge. I took notice of a large rough <HI>Jaspis</HI> stone lying upon the ground, little regarded or observed: it is about nine foot Diameter; it was presented unto the Emperor by the Archbishop of <HI>Saltzburg,</HI> whose Country assords notable Quarries, and stones of many sorts; a little piece of it polished, assords fine yellow, red, black, and white Veins. The Palace of the Count <HI>de Draun,</HI> and that which Count <HI>Rothal</HI> hath lately built and nobly furnished, are very considerable; with many others.</P>
<P>There are also many fair Churches, rich Convents, and Conventual Churches; as that of the <HI>Carmelites,</HI> of the <HI>Franciscans,</HI> of the <HI>Bere∣dictines,</HI> of St. <HI>Nicholas;</HI> In this Church I could not but take notice of the late Sepulchral Monuments of Count <HI>Strozzi</HI> and Cardinal <HI>Ha∣rach.</HI> The <HI>Dominican</HI> Convent is very fair. The <HI>Augustines</HI> have a large Church, in the middle whereof they have built a Chappel after the manner of the Holy House at <HI>Loretto;</HI> upon the top of which hang the Colours taken from the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> many of which Ensigns are not square like ours, but made Escucheon-wise, some filled with Circles, wherein are expressed half Moons. The <HI>Jesuites</HI> Colleges are large, who seldom fail of noble Convents, especially in places where they have so good footing as in this. The Front of one of their Colleges opens into a fair <HI>Piazza,</HI> in the middle whereof stands a large and high composite Column of Copper upon a Pedestal of white stone, with four Angels with Escucheons, and on the top the blessed Virgin; In∣scriptions also, in which the Emperor dedicates <HI>Austria</HI> unto her Patro∣nage and Tuition.</P>

In another Market-place, where the Town-house is, there is a handsome <HI>Statua</HI> of Justice in Copper.</P>
<P>I could not but observe the <HI>Scotch</HI> Church and Cloister, which gave also the name unto the <HI>Scotch</HI> Gate of the City, because I somewhat wondred how the <HI>Scots</HI> in old time should be so considerable in this place; but I found by Information, and the Account of <HI>Lazius</HI> and <HI>Mat∣thaeus Merian</HI> in <HI>High-dutch,</HI> that this Convent was in former times a great Receptacle for the <HI>Scots</HI> in their long Pilgrimage unto <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>
<PB N="136" REF="78"/>
founded and endowed by Duke <HI>Henry</HI> the First, in memory of St. <HI>Gre∣gory:</HI> and it may seem less strange that the <HI>Scots</HI> should have a Con∣vent here, and be numerous in these parts in former Ages, if we consider that St. <HI>Colman,</HI> one of the Saints of the greatest Veneration in this Coun∣try, was a <HI>Scotchman,</HI> and said to be of the Royal Blood of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who, in his passage to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was murdered by the <HI>Baurs</HI> or Country people at <HI>Stockerau,</HI> four <HI>German</HI> miles from <HI>Vienna,</HI> and hanged on a Tree, where, as the Story goes, his Body remained uncorrupted for a year and a half, and divers Miracles being affirmed of it, it was taken down, and honourably interred near <HI>Stockerau;</HI> but by <HI>Meginhard</HI> Bishop of <HI>Aichstadt</HI> it was translated unto <HI>Melk,</HI> and afterwards sent into <HI>Hungary,</HI> and his Head kept a long time at <HI>Stullweissenburg,</HI> or <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> according to the Account which is here given of this Saint.</P>
<P>The Church of St. <HI>Peter</HI> is also considerable, not for its Splendor but Antiquity, as being accounted the oldest in the City, standing in a place where in old time there stood an Altar in honour of <HI>Domitian,</HI> called <HI>Ara Flaviana.</HI> In this Church lies the Body of that famous and learn∣ed Person <HI>Wolfgangus Lazius,</HI> with this Epitaph or Inscription:</P>
<P>Magnisico Nobili Clarissimo atque summâ eruditione ornatissimo viro Domino <HI>Wolfgango Latzio Vien.</HI> Philosophiae atque Medicinae Doctori &amp; Professori Primario, Celeberrimi Archigymnasii <HI>Viennensis</HI> Rectori &amp; Superintendenti <HI>Caesareo,</HI> &amp; ejusdem Sacrae <HI>Caesareae</HI> Majest. <HI>Ferdinandi</HI> Sanctissimae memoriae Consiliario &amp; Historico Peritissimo defuncto Anno Domini <HI>M D LXXXVI.</HI></P>
<P>In the Church of the <HI>Capucines</HI> Convent, are interred the Emperor <HI>Matthias</HI> and his Empress, and the Empress <HI>Maria,</HI> wife to <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Third, who out of their Devotion and Humility, chose to be buri∣ed in a Church of this poor Order. And the <HI>Capucines</HI> not admitting of Magnificent Monuments in their Churches, as in the Churches of other Orders, no Tombs are erected worthy so great an Emperor, and such Empresses.</P>
<P>But the Cathedral Church of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> contains divers Monu∣ments of many Princes and Great Persons, and is a large stately Build∣ing, but somewhat dark by reason of the thick painted Glass: not co∣vered with Lead, but with Tiles of wood, which is the only blemish thereof, yet makes a good show. The Steeple and Spire are very re∣markable, as being high, large, strong, and handsome. On the top or Weather-cock-place of the Spire stands a Cross under a Star and half Moon, according to the Figure I have elsewhere set down, which the People think to be of Gold, or at least very well gilded: and in the time of Thunder and Lightning it looked pale and whitish.</P>
<P>They have this Account how these came first to be set up in this place: That when <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent besieged <HI>Vienna,</HI> percei∣ving the Forces in the City to be obstinate, he had an intent to bat∣ter down the Steeple about their ears: But some of the <HI>Bassa</HI>'s and great Commanders, advertising him how unprofitable a business it would prove, and withal when he took the City, what an honour it would be unto him to have such a Noble Pyramid in his Dominions: He sent word into the Town, That he was willing to spare the Steople,
<PB N="137" REF="78"/>
upon condition that they would set up the half Moon and Star (the <HI>Turkish</HI> Arms) upon the top thereof. They returned Answer that they would, if he would send the same unto them; which he did, and they placed it where it stands.</P>
<P>This Spire hath the largest Crockets I have observed in any, they being above a yard long, and adorned with foliage work. The Spire of <HI>Landshute</HI> in <HI>Bavaria,</HI> is accounted the highest in <HI>Germany;</HI> that of <HI>Strasburg,</HI> the neatest and fairest; and this of <HI>Vienna</HI> the largest and strongest. And therefore it is no wonder, that when the Ambassadors of <HI>Bosna</HI> formerly came unto <HI>Vienna,</HI> they so often viewed and admired this Fabrick, and plainly said, That all the mony in their Country was not sufficient to have built it.</P>
<P>This Steeple is accounted about four hundred sixty and five foot high, being about half way up three hundred and thirty eight steps. Besides other Hills, I could see <HI>Haimburger</HI> Hill within two miles of <HI>Presburg,</HI> and a great part of <HI>Austria,</HI> which the long Course of the <HI>Danube</HI> rendred very pleasant and delightful into the eye. In the Chamber or Room from whence I had this prospect, there is a Clock, whose Case being of wood, was in part burnt down by Lightning, and therefore there is water always kept in this place to extinguish the fire, and a man continually watches in the place where the Bells hang. There is also an Instrument of wood, or wooden Bells or Hammers, which they make use of from <HI>Good-Friday</HI> till <HI>Easter-sunday,</HI> all the time that our Saviour was in the Grave, during which time they permit no Bells to ring.</P>

<P>At one of the doors of the Church there is a stone placed in the wall, which is generally conceived to be one of the stones wherewith St. <HI>Stephen</HI> was stoned. It seemed to me some kind of pebble, and is worn and polished by the hands of the people, who when they enter at that door, do touch it with their fingers.

<P>The University of <HI>Vienna</HI> is also remarkable, if we consider the An∣tiquity thereof, the number of Scholars their course of Studies, their accommodations, privileges and advancements. This is said to have been begun by <HI>Albertus</HI> the Third, above three hundred years past; and their Rules, Orders, and Statutes to have been borrowed from the University of <HI>Paris,</HI> and the Students were distinguished into four Divisions or Nations; who, besides the General, have their particular Rules and Officers, and were comprehended under the <HI>Classis</HI> of <HI>Au∣strians,</HI> Nations of the <HI>Rhine, Hungarians,</HI> and <HI>Saxons.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Austrian</HI> Division were contained the <HI>Friulians,</HI> all of the Dio∣cese of <HI>Trent,</HI> all <HI>Italy,</HI> with the other Provinces beyond the Moun∣tains.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Classis</HI> of the <HI>Rhine</HI> were comprehended <HI>Suevians, Alsatians, Franconians, Hassians;</HI> also all the Provinces to the South-west, as <HI>France, Spain, Navarre, Holland, Brabant.</HI></P>
<P>In the third <HI>Classis,</HI> or <HI>Natio Hungarioe,</HI> were contained <HI>Hungarians, Bohemians, Polonians, Moravians, Sclavonians,</HI> all that speak the <HI>Sclavo∣nian</HI> Tongue, and also <HI>Germans.</HI></P>
<P>To the <HI>Classis</HI> or <HI>Natio Saxonum,</HI> were reduced <HI>Saxons, Westphalians, Frislanders, Turingians, Misnians, Brandenburgers, Prussians, Livonians, Lusatians, Pomeranians,</HI> with the <HI>Ʋltramarine</HI> Kingdoms of <HI>England, Scotland, Ireland, Sweden, Norway,</HI> and <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>
<P>These Divisions take up all the Nations of <HI>Europe;</HI> and indeed there are Students here of many Nations: and upon Contentions and Differences the several <HI>Classes</HI> will hold unto their own, and take parts, and bandy against each other, but will all unite and hold together in differences with Towns-men or Jews, which happen sometimes unto an high degree.</P>
<P>They follow here the old beaten way of Knowledge: and I met with few who had any good insight in new <HI>Philosophy;</HI> but there are many good <HI>Philologers,</HI> and are well versed in Languages, History and Antiquity: and there are many Learned Men either educated here, or come from other parts. Some who had taken notice of the <HI>Royal Society</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> were very inquisitive after it; and when I had sa∣tisfied them in all particulars, were very much pleased therewith. If they should fall into the way of <HI>Experimental Philosophy,</HI> being very industrious, 'tis very probable they may do much therein, and they were sure to have the countenance of the Emperor. I found them also much affected with the <HI>English</HI> Society in other parts of <HI>Germany.</HI> At the University of <HI>Altorff</HI> I was much enquired of concerning it: and a Magistrate of <HI>Nurnburg,</HI> who had got a <HI>Tilescope</HI> from <HI>London,</HI> invi∣ted me to his House, to practice the way of using it. <HI>Der Herr von</HI>
<PB N="140" REF="80"/>
<HI>Aldershelme</HI> of <HI>Leipsick,</HI> a Person of great Curiosity, was very inquisi∣tive after the same <HI>Society.</HI> And of late years the <HI>Curiosi</HI> of <HI>Germany</HI> have held Learned Conventions and Correspondence, and printed their <HI>Observations</HI> at <HI>Leipsick.</HI> And since my Return into <HI>England,</HI> I have been sollicited from <HI>Cassovia</HI> in <HI>Ʋpper Hungary,</HI> to send the <HI>Transactions</HI> into those Parts.</P>
<P>During my stay at <HI>Vienna,</HI> I went unto a publick Anatomy of a Woman that was beheaded: the <HI>Lecture lasted</HI> so long, that the Body was Nineteen days unburied. It was performed by a Learned Physi∣cian, Dr. <HI>Wolfjtregel,</HI> who read in <HI>Latin</HI> to the satisfaction of all per∣sons. What I most particularly observed therein was this, The <HI>Pyra∣midal Muscles</HI> very plain and large; the <HI>Ʋterus</HI> larger than is usually observed; the <HI>Cartilago Ensiformis</HI> double; the <HI>Lungs</HI> very black; the <HI>Eye</HI> was very well shown; he produced an artificial Eye of Ivory, and another large one of Pastbeard and Paper, contrived and made by himself; the <HI>Muscles</HI> of the <HI>Pharynx, Larynx, Os Hyoides,</HI> and the <HI>Tongue,</HI> after their dissection, he reduced very handsomly into their proper places again to shew their natural situation and position. The <HI>Anatomy-Theatre</HI> was of capacity to receive above an hundred persons; but of <HI>Anatomy-Theatres,</HI> until of late, there have been few in <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> or none. And when I was in the <HI>Anatomy-School</HI> at <HI>Altorff,</HI> near <HI>Nurenburg,</HI> that learned civil Professor, Dr. <HI>Mauritius Hoffmannus,</HI> told me that the same was the First in <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Paulus de Sorbait,</HI> Prime Professor, Physician unto <HI>Eleonora</HI> the Em∣press Dowager, and Knight of <HI>Hungary,</HI> was the <HI>Rector Magnificus. Zwelfer,</HI> who writ <HI>Animadversions upon the Dispensatory of Ausburg,</HI> was in great repute in <HI>Vienna,</HI> and had built for himself a Noble House in the City, but he died some time before my coming thither.</P>
<P>In fine, the University is noble, their Advancements considerable, their Privileges great, and they have the power of life and death, from Ancient and later Concessions of their Dukes and Empe∣rors.</P>
<P>But the greatest lustre unto <HI>Vienna</HI> is the Residence of the present Emperor <HI>Leopoldus;</HI> he was born in the year 1638. he was Son unto the Emperor <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Third; he was baptized by the Names of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>opoldus, Ignatius, Franciscus, Balthazar, Josephus, Felicianus.</HI> His lest Brother <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> died of the Small Pox his Fathers time. His Brother <HI>Carolus Josephus,</HI> Master of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ick Order,</HI> dyed 1662. He married <HI>Margareta</HI> Infanta of <HI>Spain,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ughter unto King <HI>Philip</HI> the Fourth, whose Children died Infants; vertuous, affable, grave and worthy Prince, and seemed to me to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e very happily here, in the love and honour of his People, Soul∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iers, and Clergy.</P>
<P>His Person is grave and graceful; he hath the <HI>Austrian</HI> Lip re∣markably, his Chin long, which is taken for a Good Physiognomical mark, and a sign of a constant, placid, and little troubled mind. He is conceived to carry in his Face the lineaments of four of his Predeces∣sours, that is of <HI>Rudolphus</HI> the First, of <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>imilian</HI> the First, of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, and <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the First. He was very affectionate unto his Empress, who, though but young, was a modest, grave Princess, had a good aspect, was zealous in her Religion, and an Enemy unto the Jews. He shewed also great respect and observance unto the
<PB N="141" REF="80"/>
Empress Dowager <HI>Elconora,</HI> who was a sober and prudent Princess, well skilled in all kind of curious Works, and delighted sometimes to shoot at Deer from a Stand, or at other Game, out of her Coach. He was also very loving unto his Sisters, beautiful and good Princesses; whereof one, the eldest, was since married unto that Noble Prince <HI>Michael Wisnowitzski,</HI> King of <HI>Poland.</HI> And afterwards to <HI>Charles Duke</HI> of <HI>Lorain.</HI></P>
<P>He speaks four Languages, <HI>German, Italian, Spanish,</HI> and <HI>Latin.</HI> He is a great Countenancer of Learned Men, and delights to read, and when occasion permits, will pass some hours at it. The worthy <HI>Pe∣trus Lambecius,</HI> his Library Keeper, and who is in great esteem with him, will usually find out some Books for him which he conceives may be acceptable. While I was there he recommended a Transla∣tion of <HI>Religio Medici</HI> unto him, wherewith the Emperor was exceed∣ingly pleased, and spake very much of it unto <HI>Lambecius,</HI> insomuch that <HI>Lambecius</HI> asked me whether I knew the Author, he being of my own name, and whether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he were living: And when he understood my near Relation to him, he became more kind and courteous than ever, and desired me to send him that Book in the Original <HI>English,</HI> which he would put into the Emperors Library: and presented me with a neat little <HI>Latin</HI> Book, called <HI>Princeps in Compendio,</HI> writ∣ten by the Emperors Father, <HI>Ferdinandus</HI> the Third.</P>
<P>He is also skilful in Musick, composes well, and delighted much in it, both at his Palace and the Church, which makes so many Musici∣ans in <HI>Vienna;</HI> for no place abounds more with them; and in the E∣vening we seldom sailed of Musick in the Streets, and at our Windows: And the Emperors delight herein makes the Church-men take the greater care to set off their Church-Musick, for he goes of∣ten to Church, and not to one, but divers, especially the best Conven∣tual Churches: and in his own Chappel some of his own Compositi∣ons are often play'd. He hath also excellent Musick in his Palace, both Vocal and Instrumental; and his private Chappel is well served, where besides the excellent Musick, there are always eight or ten Counts, Pages to the Emperor, who serve at the Altar with white wax Torches in their hands; and after the manner of the <HI>Italian</HI> Princes, divers <HI>Eunuchs</HI> to sing.</P>
<P>For his Recreations abroad, he delights much in Hunting, especially of the wild Boar in due seasons; I have known him bring home six Boars in a morning. Some stout persons, particularly count <HI>Nicholas Serini,</HI> would encounter a wild Boar alone, but at last he unfortu∣nately perished by one, which hath made others more wary since; and therefore when the Boar is at a Bay, the Huntsmen so stand about him, that the Emperor, or other great persons, may more safely make use of their Boar-spears upon him.</P>
<P>Surely there are great numbers of them about the Country, for they are no unusual or extraordinary Dish in the City, though of a de∣licious and pleasing taste. They feed upon <HI>Acorns, Beech-mast,</HI> and <HI>Chesnuts,</HI> upon the spring or sprout of <HI>Broom, Juniper,</HI> and <HI>Shrubs,</HI> and upon the roots of <HI>Fern,</HI> and will range into Corn-fields, and come out of Forests into Vineyards. The Huntsmen are notably versed and skilful in that Game; for though they see it not, they will distinguish a wild from a common Swine, and guess whether that which they hunt
<PB N="142" REF="81"/>
be Male or Female, old or young, large or small; fat or lean; and this they chiefly conjecture from their tread or foot, and the casting their hindfeet out of the track of their forefeet.</P>
<P>The Emperor being so good a Huntsman, it is the less wonder that he is esteemed a good Horseman. Certain it is, that he hath a very noble Stable of Horses, procured from all parts, <HI>Turk sh, Tartarian, Polonian, Transylvanian, Saxon, Bohemian, Hungarian, Naples,</HI> &amp;c. and they are well managed; and they ride them to the satisfaction of the Beholders.</P>
<P>Having seen the <HI>Arsenal</HI> at <HI>Venice,</HI> the <HI>Stores</HI> at <HI>Chatham,</HI> and the <HI>Naval Provisions</HI> at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> I am not like to admire any other, especially so far from the Sea, and looked for nothing of that nature in this place Notwithstanding I found an <HI>Arsenal,</HI> and place for Naval Vessels to be set out upon occasion, and some thereof were employed in the last <HI>Turkish</HI> war, when they attempted to destroy the Bridge of Boats which the <HI>Turks</HI> had made over the <HI>Danube,</HI> a little a∣bove <HI>Gran</HI> and <HI>Barchan.</HI> They are built somewhat like <HI>Galleys,</HI> carry great Guns, and a good number of Souldiers, and will make a fight upon the broad deep stream of the <HI>Danube,</HI> and may be handsomly brought into the Town behind one of the Bastions, when the River is high: and hereof there are some at <HI>Rab</HI> and <HI>Komora</HI> as I have declared elsewhere.</P>
<P>The Emperor hath many Counsellors, great Souldiers and Courti∣ers about him; among which these seemed of greatest Note.</P>
<P><HI>Eusebius Wenceslaus</HI> Duke <HI>de Sagan,</HI> Prince <HI>Lob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owitz,</HI> Prime Coun∣sellor, <HI>Hoff-meister,</HI> of the Order of the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> a person of a grave and sober Aspect, somewhat blunt in conversation, but of a generous temper, and free from all covetousness, who spent his Reve∣nues nobly, and unto his great reputation: He was chief favorite un∣to the Emperor; and though some had no great opinion of his Abilities, yet he was the first that discovered the last <HI>Hungarian</HI> defection and revolt, whereby those Noble Persons, Count <HI>Peter Serini</HI> and <HI>Nadasti</HI> (whom I saw at <HI>Vienna)</HI> were brought unto their ends.</P>
<P>Henricus Gulielmus, <HI>Count of</HI> Stahrenberg, Ober-hoff-Mareschal, <HI>or</HI> Lord Marshal of the Court.</P>
<P><HI>Johannes Maximilianus,</HI> Count of <HI>Lamburg, Oberst Kammer-Herr,</HI> or <HI>Chief of the Chamber,</HI> a Person of great esteem. The Gentlemen of the Bed-chamber are numerous, and many are in extraordinary; there may be an hundred of them, all <HI>Barons</HI> and <HI>Counts.</HI> Every one of them wears a Golden Key before his Brest; and the Grooms of the bed∣chamber wear one of Steel: Two of each attend every Night.</P>
<P>Gundakerus, <HI>Count</HI> Dietrichstein, Ober-Stall-Meister, <HI>or</HI> Chief Master of the Horse.</P>
<P>These are the Chief. These following are also considerable.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Sinzendorff, Oberste-Jag-Meister, Grand Veneur,</HI> or <HI>Hunts-Master,</HI> a Person in good favour with the Emperor, who very much de∣lights in Hunting, as have most of his Predecessors.</P>
<P>The Count of <HI>Aversberg, Oberst-Falken-Meister, Chief Falconer,</HI> who hath twelve Falconers under him.</P>
<P><HI>The Count of</HI> Paar, Chief Master of the Emperors Post.</P>
<P><HI>Leopoldus Wilhelmus,</HI> Marquis of <HI>Baden, Captain</HI> of an hundred <HI>Hartshires,</HI> who are the <HI>Horse-guard,</HI> and ride with <HI>Pistols</HI> and <HI>Cara∣b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nes</HI> out of the City; but within <HI>Vienna</HI> they carry <HI>Launces</HI> and <HI>Ja∣velins</HI> with broad points.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="81"/>
of the <HI>Foot-guard,</HI> of a good Personage, and well esteemed of by the Em∣perour.</P>
<P>Sixty, or more, <HI>Pages;</HI> for the number, is uncertain, and not limited; most of them <HI>Counts</HI> and <HI>Barons.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Raymundus,</HI> Count <HI>de Montecuculi,</HI> was his <HI>General▪</HI> President of the Council of War, Governour of <HI>Rab</HI> and the Confines about it, and of the <HI>Order</HI> of the <HI>Golden Fleece;</HI> a tall Person, somewhat lean, but hath a spirit in his look: he is one of the oldest Commanders in <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> and performed good Service in <HI>Poland, Hungary, Germany</HI> in many places, and is esteemed a prudent, valiant, and successful Com∣mander.</P>
<P>The Count <HI>de Souches</HI> was also a <HI>Commander</HI> of great Fame, and in high esteem with the Emperor. He was a Native of <HI>Rochelle:</HI> he first served the <HI>Swedes</HI> in the <HI>German</HI> wars, and was a Colonel, but upon some disgust he forsook the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and served the <HI>Imperialists,</HI> and was made Governor of <HI>Brin,</HI> the second Town in <HI>Moravia.</HI> After the taking of <HI>Crembs</HI> in <HI>Austria▪</HI> General <HI>Torstenson,</HI> besieged <HI>Brin,</HI> and sent word unto the Governor <HI>de Souches,</HI> That if he refused to deliver up the Town, he would give him no quarter. Who answered him, That he would not ask any, and also give none: and defended the place with such resolution, that after many Assaults▪ Underminings, and Attempts by <HI>Granado's, Torstenson</HI> was forced to rise, after a Siege of four months, which was so advantageous unto <HI>Austria</HI> and the <HI>Impe∣rial</HI> affairs, that the Emperor took especial notice of him, made him a <HI>Buron,</HI> and of his <HI>Privy-Council.</HI> He commanded also all the For∣ces in <HI>Vienna,</HI> and did notable Service in the last <HI>Turkish</HI> wars. He took the City of <HI>Nitra,</HI> or <HI>Nitria,</HI> not far from <HI>Strigonium</HI> or <HI>Gran;</HI> and took and slew six thousand <HI>Turks</HI> which were sent by the <HI>Vizi∣er</HI> of <HI>Bada</HI> against him: a worthy Person, and of a good Aspect. Count <HI>Souches</HI> the younger, his Son, an Heroick Commander, is Go∣vernor, of the strong fortified place <HI>Leopoldstadt</HI> by <HI>Freistadt,</HI> a Person of great Civility, unto whom I was much obliged.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Lesly,</HI> Nephew unto Count <HI>Lesly,</HI> who was sent Ambassador to <HI>Constantinople</HI> to the <HI>Sultan</HI> from the Emperor, is a Commander worthy of that esteem he hath with the Emperor; a Person of great Courage, Civility and Humanity, which I must ever acknow∣ledge.</P>
<P>The Courts of the Empress, and of the Empress Dowager, are filled with Persons of Note; and there are a great number of Souldiers in this place of great Fame, as the Marquiss <HI>Pio, Spork, Cop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and many more. Many of the Clergy and Men of Learning, are in good esteem with the Emperor; but the <HI>Jesuites Moelner</HI> and <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccabella,</HI> are his near Favorites. Many Strangers both Souldiers and Scholars, have built their Fortunes here. And surely Strangers of parts and industry, so they be of the <HI>Roman Church,</HI> are not like to raise their Fortunes any where better than in these parts.</P>
<P>Though the Emperor goes not to war in Person, yet hath he been successful in his wars, especially in the Battel with the <HI>Turks</HI> at St. <HI>Go∣dart,</HI> where the business was handsomly and actively managed, to set upon the body of the <HI>Turks,</HI> which had passed the River <HI>Rab,</HI> before the whole Forces of the <HI>Vizier</HI> could come over, to the great slaughter of the <HI>Janisaries</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> who fought stoutly, and
<PB N="144" REF="82"/>
were first put to a Retreat by the <HI>French</HI> Cavalry. For at first the <HI>Turks</HI> seemed to prevail, and had slain a great part of two Regiments of the <HI>Auxiliari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> which came out of <HI>Franconia,</HI> and after their custom, had cut off their Heads.</P>
<P>But his later wars have been still more fortunate, wherein he hath not only relieved <HI>Vienna,</HI> and taken divers cities from the <HI>Turks;</HI> but remains still Master of the Field in <HI>Hungary.</HI> Among the many no∣table things in <HI>Vienna,</HI> the <HI>Imperial</HI> Library is very remarkable. He who hath seen the <HI>Bodleian</HI> Library at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and the <HI>Vatican,</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> would be much surprized to find such a notable one here, as may compare with them; especially upon the extreme Borders of the Learn∣ed part of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The number and nobleness of the Books doth much exceed the re∣ceptacle or place which contains them, as making no fair shew at the en∣trance, and somewhat wanting light. But as for the number and value of the Books, they are of opinion here that it yields unto none, but rather excels any other Library in <HI>Europe.</HI> There was a place designed for the building of a fit receptacle for them; but, I know not how, a Thea∣tre for Comedies is now built in that place.</P>
<P>It is divided into eight Chambers or Rooms, which are so well filled, that many Books are fain to lie upon the Floor; and the Shelves stand so close, that there is but just room to pass between them. The Ma∣nuscripts, stand distinct from the printed Books, according to their Lan∣guages, being divided into six <HI>Classes, Theological, Juridical, Medical, Philosophical, Historical, Philological.</HI> There can scarce be a more ad∣mirable Collection than the Manuscripts in part of the first Chamber, of <HI>Hebrew, Syriack, Arabick, Turkish, Armenian, Aethiopick,</HI> and <HI>Chi∣nese</HI> Books.</P>
<P>It was begun, at least the Books began to be placed in this recepta∣cle, by <HI>Maximilian</HI> the First, but hath been much encreased by suc∣ceeding Emperors, most of them, since <HI>Rodolphus</HI> the First, being much addicted unto Learning, there having been large accessions from many noble Libraries, and most upon the cost of the Emperors. The choi∣cest Books in the famous Library of <HI>Buda,</HI> of King <HI>Matthias Corvinus,</HI> Son unto <HI>Huniades,</HI> are now in it. The notable Library of <HI>Wolfgan∣gus Lazius,</HI> who was Library-Keeper, was brought hither, and Three thousand Books of <HI>Johannes Sambucus</HI> are now in this Reposi∣tory.</P>
<P><HI>Augerius Bushequius,</HI> sometime Library-Keeper hereof, added much unto it; and in his two <HI>Turkish</HI> Embassies procured a great number of noble <HI>Greek</HI> Manuscripts at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> which are inscribed with his own hand, <HI>Aug. de Busbeck. emit Constantinopoli.</HI> A great many were added from the Library of the Learned <HI>Johannes Cuspinianus,</HI> Library Keeper, and Councellor unto the Emperor. The notable Li∣braries and Mathematical Instruments of <HI>Tycho Brahe, Kepler,</HI> and <HI>Gassendus,</HI> were purchased for it. But the largest accession was made by the noble Library of Count <HI>Fugger,</HI> which consisting of sixteen thousand Volumes, was purchased by <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Third. Many were brought, some few years past, from the <HI>Ambrasian</HI> Library by <HI>Inspruck,</HI> by the Learned <HI>Petrus Lambecius,</HI> Library-keeper, Historiogra∣pher, and Councellor unto the present Emperor; who hath also an ex∣cellent Library which is like to be added unto the <HI>Imperial.</HI> He then
<PB N="145" REF="82"/>
reckoned the Volumes in this great Library to amount at least to Fourscore thousand; and by this time that number may be increased, for he adds some yearly. And the number might almost be end∣less, if they would make use of their privilege, for the Emperor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ath a right to have two Books of all that are printed in <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>They have also a great advantage at <HI>Vienna</HI> to acquire good <HI>Manu∣scripts</HI> from the <HI>Turkish</HI> Dominions, for the Emperor is obliged to have a Resident with the Grand <HI>Sei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nior</HI> wheresoever he moves or orders him to be; even at the last fight of St. <HI>Godart,</HI> the Emperor's Re∣sident was in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Camp. And when I was at <HI>Larissa,</HI> in <HI>Thes∣saly,</HI> the Resident <HI>Signor de Casa Nova,</HI> was inquisitive after Books to be found among the <HI>Greeks</HI> in Monasteries and other places. And this Emperor, like his Father, will spare no cost toward such Acquiries.</P>
<P>By the especial favour of my noble Friend <HI>Lambecius,</HI> I went many times into this Library, and he was so courteous as to let me have what Books I desired unto my private Lodging: He would shew me divers Books upon what Subject I required, and offered me a sight of what Books he thought rare and estimable; and amongst others I could not but take notice of these following:</P>
<P>A <HI>Letter</HI> of the present Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> in the <HI>Chinese</HI> and <HI>Tar∣tarian</HI> Languages, unto the present Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> weaved in a very fine <HI>Roll.</HI></P>

<P>A <HI>Book</HI> in the <HI>Runick</HI> Language.</P>
<P>A very fair <HI>Manuscript</HI> of <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> with the Maps drawn in Colours.</P>

<P>An old fair <HI>Greek Manuscript</HI> of <HI>Dioscorides,</HI> written eleven hundred years since in very large <HI>Letters,</HI> without distance of <HI>Words,</HI> or <HI>Accents,</HI> wherein all the <HI>Plants</HI> are lively painted; also the <HI>Pictures</HI> of <HI>Diosco∣rides, Galen, Pamphilus, Cratevas,</HI> and other ancient <HI>Physicians,</HI> bought of a <HI>Jew</HI> at <HI>Constantinople</HI> for an hundred <HI>Ducats,</HI> by <HI>Busbequius.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Geometrical, Propositions</HI> demonstrated in the <HI>China</HI> Lan∣guage.</P>
<P>Another fair one in the <HI>China</HI> Tongue with <HI>Pictures.</HI></P>
<P>A noble old <HI>Greek Manuscript</HI> in great uncial <HI>Letters,</HI> without stops, points, or distance of words.</P>
<P>An ancient <HI>Greek Manuscript</HI> of the <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Genesis,</HI> in large <HI>Letters,</HI> without distance or accents, thirteen hundred years ago; wherein are Forty eight <HI>Pictures</HI> or <HI>Draughts</HI> in <HI>Miniature</HI> or <HI>Water-colours,</HI> much conducing to the knowledge of <HI>ancient Habits,</HI> the manner of <HI>Feasting,</HI> postures at <HI>Meals,</HI> waiting of <HI>Servants</HI> and <HI>Musical Instruments:</HI> Where∣in I could not but take notice of the <HI>Golden Spot</HI> upon <HI>Joseph</HI>'s breast; and the manner of the <HI>Execution</HI> of <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Baker, his head being put through a forked piece of wood, and his <HI>Hands</HI> tyed behind him.</P>
<P>A fair <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Albert Durer,</HI> wherein are many fine <HI>Paintings</HI> in <HI>Miniature</HI> or <HI>Limning;</HI> as also a <HI>Sphere,</HI> and within it a <HI>Globe</HI> carved and painted by him.</P>

<P>The <HI>Rareties</HI> of the great Duke of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> The <HI>Treasure</HI> of <HI>Loretto,</HI> St <HI>Mark,</HI> St. <HI>Denis</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> of the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> at <HI>Dresden,</HI> and others, were very satisfactory to me. Yet having a fair opportunity, I would not leave <HI>Vienna</HI> without a sight of the most noble <HI>Treasury</HI> or <HI>Repository</HI> of his Imperial Majesty; especially having heard so much thereof, and knowing it to be the <HI>Collection</HI> of many succeeding Em∣perors. I therefore took a fit opportunity to remain divers hours in it, and was extremely delighted with the rich and magnificent Curiosi∣ties thereof. To set down all I saw, were a work too large for this Volume; and the Catalogue of them, which is kept in this place,

takes up a large Volume in <HI>Folio.</HI> I shall therefore only mention these following, whereby some conjecture may be made of the rest.</P>

<P>A <HI>Knife</HI> swallowed by a <HI>Peasant</HI> near <HI>Prague,</HI> which was nine months in his <HI>Stomach,</HI> and safely cut out 1602. The like happened also to a person in <HI>Prussia,</HI> of which <HI>Daniel Becker</HI> hath written a peculiar <HI>Tract</HI> under this Title, <HI>De Cultrivoro Prussiaco.</HI> A fair <HI>Crucifix</HI> of <HI>Pearl.

The Haed of <HI>Charles</HI> the first King of <HI>England,</HI> in <HI>white Marble.</HI> A <HI>Ped stal</HI> of <HI>Amber,</HI> over which a <HI>Cross.</HI> The <HI>Head</HI> of St. <HI>Valerius</HI> Bishop of <HI>Tri∣ers.</HI> The <HI>Picture</HI> of St. <HI>Catherine</HI> of <HI>Sienna,</HI> drawn by <HI>Sigismund</HI> King of <HI>Poland.</HI> A Picture of the <HI>Emperor</HI> as he gives <HI>Audience,</HI> to be looked upon through a little round hole.

Diameter with XRISOS naturally in it. Unto which one applied that of St. <HI>Luke, Dico vobis quia si hi tacuerint, lapides clamabunt.</HI></P>
<P>Unto which magnificent Rareties there is one more added, the noble <HI>Chain</HI> of <HI>Pearl</HI> of eight yards long taken from the <HI>Graff Teokeoly</HI> in the late <HI>Hungarian</HI> war, as I understand since my Return.</P>
<P>I went unto divers noted Places about <HI>Vienna:</HI> I walked unto the Hill of <HI>Vienna,</HI> two <HI>English</HI> miles distant from the Town, going up all the way by an easie Ascent; from whence I had a prospect of the Ci∣ty, and the Compagnia about it, together with the high Mountains in
<PB N="150" REF="86"/>
<HI>Steirmark</HI> covered with Snow: and in my return saw the Palace of the Empress Dowager without the Town, called <HI>la Favorita,</HI> and passed by the Convent of the <HI>Paulini.</HI></P>
<P>About two <HI>English</HI> miles Eastward from <HI>Vienna,</HI> there is a very no∣ble Garden-place belonging to the Emperor, built by <HI>Rodolphu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> the Se∣cond, which hath been formerly well furnished, and provided with Plants, but now seems to be neglected, and somewhat ruinous. It consists of an inward and an outward square Garden: The inward is two hundred ordinary paces square, about the same bigness with the Place Royal at <HI>Paris:</HI> It hath a <HI>Portico</HI> or <HI>Cloyster,</HI> supported by Forty Pillars of white Stone on each side, and is covered with Copper; as are also the Pavilions which the common people think to be Gold. Besides this, there is an handsom row of Buildings well seated, called <HI>Néw-gabaú,</HI> in which at present are many wild Beasts kept. Lions and Tigres breed here, and have young ones. Some say this was the place of <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent's Tent when he besieged <HI>Vienna.</HI> But it is rather the Figure of his Pavilion which was placed on the other side of the City.</P>
<P>There is also, about two or three miles from <HI>Vienna,</HI> a noted place of Devotion, called <HI>Arnols,</HI> much frequented, especially in <HI>Lent,</HI> divers carrying Crosses very heavy all the way upon their shoulders. There is here a little House built exactly after that of the Scpulchre at <HI>Jeru∣salem;</HI> and also a handsom Copy of the Picture of our Saviour and the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> with their exact heights. That of our Saviour is about two yards high; that of the blessed Virgin three or four fingers breadth lower: These are taken from the Original in St. <HI>John de Lateran</HI> at <HI>Rome.</HI> Hither the Empress desired to go one morning from her own Palace on Foot, out of Devotion, which she performed, though with a great deal of difficulty, she being not used to walk, and the way was dusty. The Emperor accompanied her and all the Court followed on foot, which made a handsome shew.</P>
<P>Nearer unto <HI>Vienna</HI> there is also a remarkable place for Devotion, called <HI>Itzing:</HI> and in the way from <HI>Vienna</HI> unto it, the twelve Stati∣ons of the Cross are marked out in imitation of what is observed near <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> in the <HI>Via Crucis,</HI> or <HI>Dolorosa,</HI> in our Saviour's proceeding from the City unto Mount <HI>Calvary;</HI> the the Figures thereof are print∣ed, and the several paces between every Station set down. The Empe∣ror hath a handsom Park near <HI>Vienna,</HI> called the <HI>Brater,</HI> wherein I beheld the effects of the great Lightning and Thunder which happen∣ed three days before, upon many great Trees which were torn, split, or twisted. There is a House of Pleasure in it, where among other things, I could not but take notice of a Musical Instrument which I had not seen before, a <HI>Seat</HI> or <HI>Chestdrum;</HI> it hath a Cord like that of a <HI>Sea-trum∣pet,</HI> but sounds like a <HI>Kettle-drum.</HI></P>
<P>I went also unto <HI>Laxamburg,</HI> whither the Emperor often retires; he hath a House in this place, but it is old, and not large. There is also a House of Pleasure in the Mote, into which there is no other pas∣sage but through a high <HI>Corridore.</HI> T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Castle is commodiously seat∣ed for the Emperors recreation; and there is an eight-square House in the <HI>Marsh,</HI> from which the Nobility and the Empress Dowager some∣times used to shoot, she being very expert therein. Over the Gate of the Emperors House hangs a great Rib and Jaw-bone, whereof I could get no better account, than they were the Rib and Jaw-bone of
<PB N="151" REF="86"/>
a heathen maid. They seemed to me to be Bones of an <HI>Elephant.</HI> But many things that are old or obscure, they call, in this Country, Hea∣then: as <HI>Roman</HI> Coyns, they call Heathen money. And the Peasants brought me, in a place which had been formerly an old <HI>Roman</HI> Station, part of the bit of a Bridle digged up, which they concluded to be a Heathen Key.</P>
<P>From hence I went unto <HI>Mannersdorff,</HI> seated not far from the River <HI>Leyta,</HI> where there is a natural <HI>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Bath,</HI> called the <HI>Wildebath;</HI> it ari∣ses under a Church, the Church being built over the Spring-head. The water of it is but Luke-warm, and therefore when they desire it hotter, they boyl it, and so bathe in Tubs in a large room. From that Substance which sticks to the sides of the Coppers in the boyl∣ing of it, they judge it to be impregnated with <HI>Sulphur, Salt-peter,</HI> and <HI>Chalk.</HI> The water colours the stones, and makes them look, when wet, like fine <HI>Turquois<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI> And the vapour of the Bath hanging upon the Moss on the sides, gives it an Amber or Gold colour. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hysicians of <HI>Vienna</HI> have given a good account concerning the use of these Baths in <HI>High-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utch.</HI> Not far from hence is a noted Quarry of Stone, out of which a great part of <HI>Vienna</HI> is built. The Stones are large and they cut, and square them at the Quarry.</P>
<P>From hence I proceeded to the <HI>Newsidler sea</HI> or <HI>Lake,</HI> so called from <HI>Newsidle,</HI> which is a Town seated upon the Northern part of it, con∣sisting of one street and some back-houses, and a small, square, old Castle upon a Hill, from whence I had a good prospect over the Lake. It is about three <HI>German</HI> miles broad, and seven miles long. The fairest Lake in these parts affording plenty of Fish; encompassed and thickly set about with small Towns and Villages; and hath no River, at least not considerable, running into or out of it. A little way from the Gate of <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sidle</HI> they dig out a black earth, out of which they make <HI>Salt∣peter.</HI> In this Journey, not far from <HI>Himburg,</HI> we passed by a place called <HI>Rauckward,</HI> which, though it seems not high, looks over a great part of <HI>Austria,</HI> and as far as <HI>Brin,</HI> the second City of <HI>Moravia,</HI> a part also of the Kingdom of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and a part of the Kingdom of <HI>Hun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a.</HI> I went afterwards four <HI>English</HI> miles up the Stream of the <HI>Danube,</HI> to see a noted Quarry of Stone in a Hill called <HI>Altenburg.</HI> The beds, rows, or cases of the Stones lie not horizontally, but rather elevated North∣ward, about the height of the Angle forty, yet are not always so re∣gularly placed, but rather follow the shape of the Hill, and according to that are differently situated. Here I also observed a Substance be∣tween a Clay and a stone called <HI>Leberstein,</HI> or <HI>Liverstone;</HI> and upon many of these Stones I found the figures of Trees and Leaves, though not so deep or neat as upon the Stones by <HI>Florence;</HI> yet very prettily marked, and often with broader Leaves, than I had elsewhere observed. I passed forward to <HI>Closter-Neubur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> a Town most of it belonging to that notable rich Monastery seated here, founded by St. <HI>Leopoldus</HI> Marquess of <HI>Austria,</HI> and since much enriched by succeeding Dona∣tions.</P>
<P><HI>Matthaeus Merian</HI> hath a good cut of the Prospect of the <HI>Danube</HI> hereabouts, and in what manner it passes downwards between the two great Hills of <HI>Kalenberg</HI> and <HI>Bisnberg.</HI> Upon one Peak of <HI>Kalen∣breg</HI> live divers <HI>Camaldulenses,</HI> of an Order the most severe of any, li∣ving most upon Roots and Herbs, in the manner of <HI>Hermites.</HI> Near
<PB N="152" REF="87"/>
their Cells they had paved the ground with those Stones I mentioned, which were naturally marked with the Shapes of Trees and Plants.</P>
<P>After an open Autumn there followed a sharp Winter at <HI>Vienna,</HI> in the months of <HI>December</HI> and <HI>January.</HI> The branches of the <HI>Danube</HI> were soon frozen over. The main Stream, by reason of its swift Cur∣rent, held out longer, but was afterwards also frozen. Some have thought that this River is more apt to freez than others. And we read of Battels which have been fought upon this River frozen; but I could not make any regular Observation thereof. This hard weather, the ground being covered with Snow, afforded handsom Re∣creations unto men, and some unto the Ladies, in running Courses in handsom Sleds and Devices upon the Snow. Their Sleds were well contrived in the shape of <HI>Griffins, Tigers, Swans, Scallop Shells, Dol∣phins, Peacocks,</HI> and the like Curiosities, cared, painted, and gilded. The Lady sits in one of these, richly habited in Velvet, lined with rich Furrs, set off with Lace and Jewels, in a Velvet Cap lined with Sables. The Sled is drawn by a Horse, dressed up with Feathers of all colours, and Bells hanging about him, a pair of Stags horns behind his head, Ribbons and other Ornaments: one or more Pages ride by on Horse∣back with Torches in their hands. And after this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anner they per∣form their Course upon the frozen Snow about the streets of <HI>Vienna,</HI> in the night, with good speed one after another. A Gentleman sits behind the Lady and guides the Horse. But the Frost breaking up put an end to these Recreations. The Frost began and ended here the same day that it began and ended in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Festivity of <HI>Christmas</HI> was observed much after the same Man∣ner, Ceremonies, and Solemnities, as in <HI>Italy.</HI> On <HI>Christmas-day</HI> the Emperor dined publickly, attended with many Nobles and great Per∣sons, and three remarkable low Dwarss. Upon St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s day he went to the Cathedral of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> and went up to the Altar, kneeled, and kissed the Plate whereon the <HI>Hostia</HI> had lain. At the <HI>Epiphany</HI> or <HI>Twelfth-tide,</HI> the old custom of choosing King and Queen was ob∣served at Court. Count <HI>Lesly</HI> happened to be King, the Emperor laid the Cloth, and the Empress filled out Wine, together with other old Customs, Fetched perhaps in part from ancienter times, <HI>Saturnalium diebus, mos Romanis, praebere servis convivium sic ut ipsi officia serv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rum obirent.</HI></P>
<P>Before <HI>Christmas</HI> there was extraordinary mirth and jollity at the Court upon occasion of a Marriage: For Count <HI>Serau,</HI> Governor of <HI>Gratz</HI> in <HI>Styria,</HI> married a natural Daughter of <HI>Philip</HI> the Fourth, King of <HI>Spain,</HI> which was observed with many noble Solemnities and Bra∣veries. And the Nobility and Ladies were so substantially splendid, that I was much surprized thereat.</P>
<P>This was followed by a Funeral Solemnity for the Count of <HI>Draun,</HI> who was Colonel of the Forces in <HI>Vienna,</HI> and who had one of the no∣blest Houses in the City; his Corps was brought out of <HI>Italy,</HI> and in∣terred in the <HI>Dominican</HI> Church, where he formerly built a very fair Altar; there was raised for him a <HI>Castrum Doloris,</HI> handsomly contrived and set round with white Wax Torches and Candles.</P>
<P>While I was in <HI>Vien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a,</HI> the Empress <HI>Margarita</HI> was delivered of a Daughter, which was Christned by the name of <HI>Maria, Antonina, Jose∣pha,</HI>

<HI>Benedicta, Rosalia, Petronella,</HI> but she lived not many months. When the Empress came abroad, she brought the Child to the <HI>Augu∣stines</HI> Church, where Cardinal <HI>Carlo Caraffa,</HI> the Pope's Nuncio, recei∣ved it, blessed it, and laid it upon the Altar.</P>
<P>During my stay here, the Election was in readiness for a King of <HI>Po∣land,</HI> after the voluntary resignation of that Crown by King <HI>Casimir;</HI> and Couriers often passed between that Country and this. There were Competitors the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy</HI>'s Son, the Duke of <HI>Newburg,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Lorrain.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> moved actively for the Duke of <HI>New∣burg,</HI> the Emperor for the Prince of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who was then at <HI>Vi nna,</HI> in great favour with the Emperor, who greatly promoted his interest; a Person of great esteem, and who if General <HI>Lub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mirski</HI> had been li∣ving, who was his intimate Friend, in all probability might have ob∣tained the Crown; and thereupon it was conceived that he should have married the Emperor's Sister. But the <HI>Poles</HI> made choice of one of their own Country, who was no Competitor, <HI>Michael Wisnowitski</HI> de∣ceased, who also married the Sister of the Emperor.</P>
<P>When I was here, there were many Ambassadours of Note, <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Bal∣thasar de la Cueva,</HI> Marquiss of <HI>Malago<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and Brother to the Viceroy of <HI>Naples,</HI> was Ambassador for <HI>Spain.</HI> Cardinal <HI>Carlo Carassa</HI> was the Pope's Nuncio. The <HI>Venetia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Ambassador Extraordinary, sollicited for assistance for <HI>Candia,</HI> and he obtained the Regiment of <HI>Porcia</HI> under Marquis <HI>Pio.</HI> Count <HI>Souches</HI> the younger, who was Governor of <HI>Leo∣p ldstadt,</HI> and many noble and valiant Souldiers were preparing for that Expedition. The <HI>Turks</HI> gave assurance of the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI>'s intenti∣on to maintain the Peace inviolably; and requested the Emperor not to assist the <HI>Venetians,</HI> or <HI>Transylvanians,</HI> nor to promote, but rather hinder, the Election of the Emperor of <HI>Muscovy</HI>'s Son to the Crown of <HI>Poland.</HI> The Bishop of <HI>Beziers,</HI> sent by the King of <HI>France</HI> to the E∣lection of the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> came not hither, but passed through <HI>Nu∣renburg,</HI> where I lodged at the same Inn: They were generally here a∣gainst the <HI>French</HI> Interest, and so were a great part of the <HI>Polish</HI> No∣bility. An Ambassador came also from the <HI>Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary,</HI> to con∣firm a Peace, and afford mutual Assistance upon occasion. <HI>Cha Gagi A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI> was the Ambassador, who brought a Present of the best <HI>Tartarian</HI> Horses, which are of high esteem for swiftness, hardiness, boldness in passing frozen Rivers, and taking and swimming over great Streams. He was dismissed with noble Presents of Plate. The Emperor present∣ed the <HI>Cham</HI> of Tartary with a fair Silver Bason and Ewer, and a curi∣ous Watch; and sent Presents unto the <HI>Chammine</HI> his Wife; and also to his Sister and four Brothers. His Followers were stout men, of good stature, coarse Complexions, wearing long furr'd Vests and Cal∣packs, or furr'd Caps. Some of them had silver Rings with the same Signatures of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Seals. They took much Tabaco in very long Pipes. Their Tabaco is not in Rolls, but in Leaves, &amp; dry. They went about wandring and gazing at most things, as Churches, Houses, Shops: And took much delight to be in the Fair, where they would take much notice of small trifles. Yet these are the men that make such sad In∣cursions into the Eastern parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and carrying away so many thousands, sell them to the <HI>Turks,</HI> and so repair the defect of People in <HI>Turky.</HI> And now after the Consumption of men in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and the Country about by the Plague, are like to be active in that

Trade, hoping to find better Markets for their Plagiaries and Depreda∣tions.</P>
<P>There are divers <HI>Greeks,</HI> who trade to <HI>Vienna,</HI> and many live in the Town, among which I met with three considerable persons. One a grave Abbot, who was forced from his Convent by the <HI>Turk,</HI> upon sus∣picion that he corresponded with those of <HI>Candia.</HI> Another, who went by the name of <HI>Constantinus Catacuz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nos,</HI> and was of the Blood Royal of the <HI>Catacuzeni.</HI> The third was <HI>Jeremias</HI> a <HI>Greek</HI> Priest, who had travelled through <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>France</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> and from thence through the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> to <HI>Vienna,</HI> and intended for <HI>Constantinople.</HI> He came into <HI>England</HI> to enquire after a young man who was in a Ship which was first taken by an <HI>Algerine,</HI> and after∣wards by an <HI>English</HI> man of war in the <HI>Levant.</HI> He was very kindly used in <HI>England,</HI> and particularly at <HI>Cambridge.</HI> He did a great deal of honour at <HI>Vienna,</HI> unto the <HI>English</HI> Nation, declaring that they were the most civil, generous, and learned people he had met with in all his Travels, and that he no where found so many who could speak or un∣derstand <HI>Greek,</HI> or who gave him so good satisfaction in all parts of Knowledge: And as a testimony of his respect and gratitude, request∣ed me to enclose a <HI>Greek</HI> Letter unto Dr. <HI>Piers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,</HI> now Lord Bishop of <HI>Chesler,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Barrow</HI> Master of <HI>Trinity College</HI> in <HI>Cambridge.</HI></P>
<P>M st men live here plentifully, there being abundance of all provi∣sion. They have great quantity of Corn, which upon Scarcity, by the help of the <HI>Danube,</HI> might be brought to them from remoter parts. The Country affords such plenty of wine, that they send a considera∣ble quantity up the River. They have also rich wines out of <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> and such variety, that there are more than thirty several sorts of Wine to be sold in <HI>Vienna.</HI> They are not also without good Beer. <HI>Halsladt</HI> in <HI>Austria</HI> affords them Salt, where they make it by letting in water into the hollow parts of a Mountain, where it drinks in the Salt of the Earth, and is afterwards let out and boiled up. This affords great profit to the Emperor, and therefore the <HI>Hun∣garian</HI> Salt is not permitted to be brought higher than <HI>Presburg.</HI> They have also plenty of Sheep and Oxen; but for Oxen at present they are also supplied from <HI>Hungary,</HI> nor only from the Countries in the Emperors Dominions, but from the Turkish parts, by permission of the <HI>Grand Seignior;</HI> and they are brought hither by the Eastern Com∣pany of <HI>Vienna.</HI> They eat much wild Boar, whereof the Fat is deli∣cious, like that of Vension with us. They want not Hares, Rabbets, Partridges, Pheasants. A Foul called <HI>Hasenhendal,</HI> or <HI>Gallina Corylo∣rum,</HI> is much esteemed by them, which made me the more wonder to meet with some odd dishes at their Tables; as <HI>Guiny-Pigs,</HI> divers sorts of <HI>Snails,</HI> and <HI>Tortoises.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Danube,</HI> and many Rivers which run into it, afford them plen∣ty of Fish, extraordinary <HI>Carps, Trouts, Tenches, Pikes, E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls,</HI> several sorts of <HI>Lampreys,</HI> and many fishes finely coloured; the white Fish, <HI>Crevisses</HI> very large; the best come out of the River <HI>Swechet,</HI> not far from <HI>Vienna.</HI> They have also that Substantial large fish, called <HI>Schei∣den,</HI> or <HI>Silurus Gesneri,</HI> larger than <HI>Pike, S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lmon,</HI> or any of our River Fishes; but the great Fishes called <HI>Hausons,</HI> or <HI>Husones,</HI> in <HI>Johnstonus,</HI> for largeness exceed all others; some being twenty foot long. Some think this to be the same Fish which <HI>Aelian</HI> names <HI>Antacetus,</HI> and

speaks largely of the fishing for them in <HI>Ister.</HI> I was at the fishing places for <HI>Hausons</HI> in <HI>Schüt</HI> Island, between <HI>Presburg</HI> and <HI>Komard,</HI> for they come not usually higher, especially in shoals; and it is much that they come so high, for they are conceived to come out of the <HI>Euxine-sea,</HI> and so up the stream. They eat them both fresh and salt∣ed; they taste most like <HI>Sturgeon.</HI> It is a Cartilagineous Fish, consist∣ing of gristles, and they have a hollow nervous chord all down the back, which being dried serves for a whip. When they fish for them they blow a Horn or Trumpet and know where they go by the moving of the water. From <HI>Venice</HI> they are supplied with Oysters, with salt <HI>Sturgeon,</HI> and sometimes with red <HI>Herrings,</HI> and great variety of other Fishes pickled up: as also with <HI>Oranges, Limons,</HI> and other Fruits. Observing much freedom, musick, and jollity in the City. I won∣dered how they could content themselves without Plays, for there were few while I was there, till the Players came hither out of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and a∣cted here for a time. The Jesuites would sometimes entertain the Emperor and Empress with a Comedy at their College; and I had once the favour to be at one when they were present.</P>
<P>But they have Dancing and Fencing often, and every <HI>Holy-day</HI> af∣ter dinner, the people flock to some Inns where there is Dancing in the inward Rooms, and Fencing and Playing of Prizes upon a Stage in the Yard; and at the Windows, or from the Galleries, they behold the Fencers playing at several Weapons; and commonly pass the rest of the day in delights and merry Company.</P>
<P>In Treason and high Crimes they cut off the right Hand of the Ma∣lefactor, and his Head immediately after. I saw a Woman beheaded sitting in a Chair, the Executioner striking off her Head with a Fore∣blow, she behaved her self well, and was accompanied unto the Mar∣ket place by the <HI>Confraternity</HI> of the <HI>Dead,</HI> who have a charitable care of such Persons, and are not of any Religious Order, but <HI>Lay-men;</HI> among whom also in this place there are many Fraternities and Orders, as of the <HI>Holy Virgin,</HI> of the <HI>Holy Cross,</HI> and others. Another person also executed after the same manner; as soon as his head fell to the ground, while the Body was in the Chair, a man run speedily with a Pot in his hand, and filling it with the Blood, yet spouting out of his Neck, he presently drank it off, and ran away; and this he did as a Remedy against the <HI>Falling-Sickness.</HI> I have read of some who have approved the same Medicine; and heard of others who have done the like in <HI>Germany.</HI> And <HI>Celsus</HI> takes notice, that in his time some Epileptical persons did drink the Blood of the <HI>Gladiatours.</HI> But many Physicians have, in all times, abominated that Medicine. Nor did I stay afterwards so long as to know the effect thereof, as to the intended cure. But most men looked upon it as of great uncertainty: and of all men the Jews, who suffer no Blood to come into their Lips, must most dislike it.</P>
<P>At <HI>Presburg</HI> they have a strange way of Execution, still used at <HI>Metz,</HI> and some other places, by a Maid, or Engine like a Maid finely dressed up with her hands before her. The Malefactor salutes her first, and then retires. But at his second salute she opens her hands and cuts his Heart in sunder.</P>
<P>Though the Winter was sharp, yet the advantage of Stoves and ly∣ing between two Feather-beds made it tolerable: For they use Stoves
<PB N="156" REF="91"/>
here as in other parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> where they lodge and eat in Stoves; and great Persons have Stoves in the Church, or such as look into the Church. There are Stoves also in the publick Schools where Lectures are read. And this way of lying between two Feather-beds, with a neat laced sheet spread over, is more convenient in a cold Country, than most others they make use of. For in the common Inns in <HI>Ger∣many</HI> they generally sleep upon Straw, and also in <HI>Hungary</HI> almost eve∣ry where; and more Easterly upon the ground, spreading a Carpet or Saddle-cloth under them: and more Northerly they content them∣selves with the Skins of Beasts, <HI>Bears, Elks,</HI> or the like; upon which they sleep in the night. Those that sleep lowest are coolest in a Stove; those that lie upon Tables, Benches, or higher, are more exposed to the heat. The Citizens of <HI>Vienna</HI> are well attired, and use Furs very much The Women wear a high Velvet Bonnet, lined or faced therewith. The Place seemed to be healthful; but they speak much of the <HI>Colica Austriaca,</HI> as an Endemical and Local Disease, very hardly yielding unto good <HI>Medicines.</HI> They speak good <HI>German</HI> at the Court and in the Ci∣ty; but the Common &amp; Country people seemed to speak grumblingly, and besides their accent, have divers words different from other parts.</P>
<P>They have a Custom upon St. <HI>Nicholas-day</HI> to put some small Gift into the Childrens shooes; among other things they put in Medals and Dol∣lars made of paper and flour, gilded and silvered over, yet scarce worth a penny. They sell <HI>Trochies</HI> or <HI>Tablets</HI> in the markets, made of the pulp of the Fruit of <HI>Hip-briar,</HI> made sharp with <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> very refreshing. Some carry about them a <HI>Thunder-stone</HI> as a defence against Thunder: and they rub their Childrens Gums with a <HI>Wolf's</HI> tooth instead of <HI>Coral.</HI></P>
<P>When I was at <HI>Venice,</HI> in the time of the <HI>Carnival,</HI> I observed many Recreations and Shews, as Rope-dancing, flying down the Rope, cut∣ing off Bulls-necks with Swords, and many other. But at <HI>Vienna</HI> a nota∣ble trick which I saw there, pleased me much: A man of a middle Sta∣ture laid down upon his back, and a heavy Anvil was placed upon his Breast, as much as two men could well list, then two other men with great Hammers laid on, until they had given almost an hun∣dred blows, and cut in sunder a great Horshooe of iron, about half an inch thick.</P>
<P>Here is no Christian Religion publickly permitted but the <HI>Ro∣man,</HI> and therefore those of the <HI>Protestant,</HI> and <HI>Reformed Religion</HI> are fain to resort to <HI>Presburg,</HI> Forty miles off, for which they have some convenience by the <HI>Danube,</HI> and a <HI>Coach</HI> which goes every day. In the time of <HI>Maximilian</HI> the Second, they were permitted the Ex∣ercise of their Religion in the Church of the <HI>Holy Cross,</HI> in the Ci∣ty of <HI>Vienna.</HI> But afterwards were prohibited by <HI>Rodolphus</HI> the Se∣cond. The Emperor <HI>Matthias</HI> gave them permission to meet at <HI>Her∣nals,</HI> a little more than an <HI>English</HI> mile from <HI>Vienna;</HI> and gave leave to their <HI>Ministers</HI> to come into the City, and there to <HI>christen, mar∣ry, baptize,</HI> and <HI>visit</HI> the sick. From which time they encreased very much, till <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Second, returning from the Battel of <HI>Prague,</HI> ba∣nished their <HI>Minister</HI> from <HI>Vienna,</HI> and <HI>Arnolds,;</HI> sent the <HI>Freyherr Jorger,</HI> to whom the Castle of <HI>Arnolds</HI> belonged, Prisoner unto <HI>Lintz;</HI> and never gave over till he had taken away their Privileges and Free∣dom of meeting publickly in any part of <HI>lower Austria.</HI></P>

But here are no small number of <HI>Jews,</HI> who have a distinct Habita∣tion assigned them over the Water. They have also a Street allowed them in the City for the day time, but they must all depart at night be∣yond the River into the Suburbs.</P>
<P>They are much distasted by the Citizens and Tradesmen, and the Scholars agree but ill with them. While I was at <HI>Vienna</HI> there was a quarrel between them to an high degree. For the <HI>Scholars</HI> assaulted the <HI>Jews</HI> Town, beat, wounded, and threw divers of them into the Ri∣ver. Divers <HI>Scholars</HI> were wounded, some killed, and also some Soul∣diers, who were commanded out to compose the Fray: and the <HI>Jews</HI> Town was guarded many days by the Souldiers of the City. This begot such ill Blood, and Complaints, that a good number of the <HI>Jews</HI> were to be banished at a certain day. The <HI>Jews,</HI> to ingratiate with the Empress, then with Child, presented her with a noble <HI>Silver Cradle,</HI> but she would not receive it; and there was great danger of the general banishment of them when I left that City, which was afterwards effected, they being severely prohibited from living, not only at <HI>Vien∣na,</HI> but in any part of <HI>Austria,</HI> where there were formerly whole Vil∣lages of them, so as they were forced to betake themselves into the Do∣minions of the <HI>Turk,</HI> unto <HI>Venice,</HI> into <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Bohemia.</HI> They being not permitted to dwell in the Neighbour Countries of <HI>Hungary,</HI> subject to the Emperor, <HI>Styria,</HI> or <HI>Carinthia.</HI> But many of them went to <HI>Buda</HI> and were besieged there in the year 1684 and becoming obstinate haters of the <HI>Germans,</HI> they assisted the <HI>Turks</HI> with their Purses and with what else they were able to maintain the Town against the Imperial Forces.</P>
<P>I must confess they seemed useful to <HI>Vienna</HI> for ready accommodati∣on of any thing, either by sale or exchange, but the people looked with an ill eye upon them, as taking away much of their Trade and Employment. They also looked upon them as useless to them in war for the defence of the place as Souldiers; and were not without some jealousie that they held Correspondence with the <HI>Turks,</HI> and gave them Intelligence of their Affairs. Yet the Souldiery dealt much with them, and Captains for the suddain habiting, furnishing, and ac∣commodating of their Companies. And dining one day with a Commander at a <HI>Jew</HI>'s House, amongst other Discourse, I asked the <HI>Jew</HI> concerning the <HI>ten Tribes,</HI> and where they were? He said <HI>they were far off in</HI> Asia, <HI>b yond a great Lake which was continually stormy, and scarce passable, but upon their Sabbath-day, upon which days the Jews do not willingly travel.</HI></P>
<P>I have seen their <HI>Circumcision</HI> at <HI>Rome, Padua,</HI> and other parts. Their <HI>Physicians,</HI> ordinarily profess great skill in <HI>Ʋrines;</HI> and the com∣mon people resort unto them rather than unto <HI>Christians,</HI> and are so credulous, and have such an opinion of them, that they might be made to believe they have some old <HI>Receipts</HI> of King <HI>Solomon.</HI></P>
<P>There are many <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> yet they seem to me to be in greater numbers in <HI>Germany.</HI> In <HI>Amsterdam</HI> they are also grown very nu∣merous. At <HI>Franckfurt</HI> they told me there were seven thousand of them, which seemed scarce credible. At <HI>Colen</HI> they are in great num∣bers: at <HI>Hamburg</HI> not a few. But the greatest number surely is in <HI>Prague.</HI></P>
<P>Though they be permitted in many Countries, yet divers <HI>Christian Princes</HI> and <HI>States</HI> have assigned them some mark in their <HI>Habits,</HI>
<PB N="158" REF="92"/>
to distinguish them. In <HI>Avignon</HI> their <HI>Hats</HI> are <HI>yellow.</HI> In <HI>Italy</HI> their <HI>Hats</HI> are covered over with <HI>Taffate.</HI> In <HI>Germany</HI> they wear <HI>Ruffs</HI> and <HI>Gowns</HI> with great <HI>Capes.</HI> In <HI>Holland</HI> I observed no distinction. But the <HI>Jews</HI> there, most of them having come out of <HI>Portugal,</HI> there may be some suspicion of them from their complexion.</P>
<P>Lastly, when I consider the old strength of <HI>Vienna,</HI> consisting in an old <HI>wall</HI> and a deep <HI>Ditch,</HI> I cannot much wonder that <HI>Matthias Corvinus,</HI> King of <HI>Hungary,</HI> took this City. And I must ascribe it, under God, unto the singular valour and resolution of the Defendants, that <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent, with two hundred thousand men, was not able to take it, and though he made large breaches, could never enter it, but lost some thousands at an Assault, and departed at last with the loss of a great part of his Army. But this place is now in a far better condition strongly fortified, and able to resist the greatest Forces of <HI>Turky.</HI> The <HI>houses</HI> are cleared from the <HI>wall;</HI> and yet for better security, when I was there, Count <HI>Souches</HI> advised the Emperor to pull down part of the <HI>Suburbs</HI> upon the other side of the nearest branch of the <HI>Danube,</HI> left the <HI>Turks</HI> might take advantage to play up∣on the two <HI>Bastions</HI> on that side.</P>
<P>It would be a sad loss for <HI>Christendom,</HI> if this place were in the hands of the <HI>Turk;</HI> and no man knows where he would rest. If he should begin with this place, and take it, the strong holds of <HI>Rab, Ko∣mara,</HI> and <HI>Leopoldstadt</HI> would want their support, and soon fall into his Possession; and if he were Lord of <HI>Austria,</HI> a great part of <HI>Germany</HI> would lie bare unto him: and probably it would not be long before he visi∣ted <HI>Italy,</HI> into which Country he would then find many ways. Yet this hath since been attempted, with great force, and violence; when in the year one thousand six hundred and eighty three. The <HI>Grand Seig∣nior</HI> sent <HI>Kara Mustapha Bassa,</HI> with an army of an hundred and four∣score thousand men into <HI>Austria,</HI> who besieged, assaulted, and stor∣med this place for two months together, till such time as the Christi∣an Army came down and relieved it. For the <HI>Garrison</HI> under the Command of Count <HI>Stahremberg</HI> having behaved themselves most cou∣rageously, and dayly shown much valour and Bravery, in such sort, that before the Seventh of <HI>September</HI> they had destroyed fifty thou∣sand of the <HI>Turks;</HI> The King of <HI>Poland,</HI> the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> the Elector of <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>varia,</HI> came five days after, all at the head of their own forces. The Duke of <HI>Lorain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Saxen▪Lawenburg,</HI> the two Marquisses of <HI>Baden,</HI> the Prince <HI>de Croy,</HI> and the Emperors Generals, and Colonels, <HI>Caprara, Leslye, Rabbata, Dunwald, Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fy,</HI> Baron <HI>Mercy, Halweil, Diepenthal,</HI> and others. And thus united, totally routed the <HI>Turkish</HI> army, and made the <HI>Grand Vizier, Kara Mustapha,</HI> fly before them and leave all his provision, Ammunition and Riches behind him, having nothing left him, but a sad repentance for his rash attempt, and time to consider how little he was like to be beholden to those who employed him, wishing to himself, no doubt, by this time, that the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttoman</HI> family had never come to this greatness as to be able to com∣mand him, and so many thousand more to run their heads, to no purpose, against the strong walls of <HI>Beatch.</HI> And would then have been well satisfied, that old <HI>Ertogrul,</HI> and <HI>Dunder</HI> had all along continued Shepherds in the East.

<P>Having passed the <HI>River,</HI> I entred into the <HI>Trans-Danubian Austria,</HI> or that part of <HI>Austria</HI> which lies between the <HI>Danube</HI> and the Ri∣ver<NOTE PLACE="marg">Corneuburg.</NOTE> <HI>Theya,</HI> and came unto <HI>Corneuburg,</HI> a pretty Town, about which place the Emperor often hunts; it is near the Hill <HI>Bisneberg,</HI> which is opposite unto <HI>Kalenherg.</HI> The <HI>Swedes</HI> advanced far when they took this place in the last wars, and held it so well, that they were not easily forced out of it. From thence I came to <HI>Stockerau,</HI> near the mouth of the River <HI>Mida,</HI> where it runs into the <HI>Danube.</HI> A place much noted for the death of St. <HI>Colman,</HI> a <HI>Scotch</HI> Saint, highly honour∣ed in these parts.

In all this part of <HI>Austria,</HI> which extends a great length on the North side of the <HI>Danube,</HI> conceived to have been anciently inhabited by the <HI>Marcomanni</HI> and <HI>Quadi,</HI> there are few or no <HI>Towns</HI> of <HI>antiquity, largeness,</HI> or <HI>note;</HI> for the <HI>Romans</HI> made their Stations and Colonies upon the South-side of the <HI>Danube;</HI> but the Country is full of Vil∣lages, and populous. One of the chiefest Towns is <HI>Crembs,</HI> which some call <HI>Cremona Austriae,</HI> which I saw as I came down the <HI>Danube.</HI> A great part of this Country was notably harrassed and plundered by the <HI>Swedes.</HI> The <HI>Soyl</HI> is light and easie to be ploughed.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iglau.</NOTE> From thence we passed by <HI>Ʋlverskirke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Paulitz,</HI> and <HI>Moravian Budweisse,</HI> to <HI>Zimmaw,</HI> and by <HI>Byrnitz</HI> came to <HI>Igla,</HI> or <HI>Iglau,</HI> upon the River <HI>Igl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> which at last runs into the great River <HI>Marck,</HI> a very plea∣sant place, seated upon a Hill, on the Frontiers of <HI>Bohemia.</HI> It is well fortified <HI>à la moderna,</HI> upon one side, and hath one of the largest <HI>Piazza</HI>'s that I have seen.</P>
<P><HI>Moravia,</HI> is a pleasant and fruitful Country affording plenty of ne∣cessaries for life; the people are plain dealing, stout, and make good Souldiers. It is commodiously furnished with Rivers, the greatest whereof is the <HI>Mora</HI> or <HI>Marck,</HI> which arising in the Northern part thereof, runs quite through the Country, and enters the <HI>Donaw</HI> by <HI>Teben</HI> not far from <HI>Presburg.</HI> The other considerable Streams are the <HI>Theya</HI> or <HI>Thaisa,</HI> the <HI>Swarta,</HI> the <HI>Schwitta,</HI> which run into the <HI>Marck.</HI> In the last <HI>Turkish</HI> wars the <HI>Tartars</HI> having passed the <HI>Wag</HI> in <HI>Hunga∣ria,</HI> made incursions into <HI>Moravia,</HI> and carried away some thousands of the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Igla,</HI> wee soon came into <HI>Bohemia,</HI> first coming into <HI>Ste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k∣en,</HI> then to <HI>Teutchin Broda</HI> by the River <HI>Sac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ua,</HI> formerly a strong place taken by <HI>Zisca,</HI> the famous <HI>Bohemian General,</HI> who then forced the Emperor <HI>Sigismund</HI> to fly out of <HI>Bohemia</HI> by the way of <HI>Igla</HI> From thence we came to <HI>Haberne,</HI> and so to <HI>Janikaw:</HI> At this place, upon the 24<HI>th</HI> of <HI>February,</HI> 1643. was fought that, memorable Battel be∣tween the <HI>Swedes,</HI> commanded by <HI>Leonard Torstenson,</HI> and the <HI>Impe∣rialists</HI> under Count <HI>Hatzsield, Goetz,</HI> and other <HI>Commanders.</HI> The <HI>Imperialists</HI> had the better at first; but falling upon the Enemies Bag∣gage, and being two greedy of Booty, they were defeated, three thousand slain, four thousand taken prisoners, with their General <HI>Hatz∣sield,</HI> and six or seven Colonels. The success hereof gave the <HI>Swedes</HI> advantage to proceed further, and into <HI>Silesia</HI> and <HI>Austria.</HI> In this Town meeting with a Gentleman who came from <HI>Schaclitz,</HI> which is not far from the <HI>Risgeburg,</HI> or <HI>Mountain of Gya its,</HI> about the Head of the River <HI>Elbe,</HI> I enquired of him concerning the spirit <HI>Ri∣bensal,</HI> which is said to insest that Country, but he could say no∣thing therein of his own knowledge; and though he was confident that there was such a Spirit, yet he confessed that for twelve years it had done no hurt.

And <HI>Agricola</HI> in the latter end of his Sixth Book <HI>De re M tallica,</HI> gives this for one reason why <HI>Mines,</HI> or <HI>passages</HI> in <HI>Mines,</HI> are given over.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Czaslaw.</NOTE> From <HI>Janikaw</HI> I travelled to <HI>Czaslaw,</HI> a good Town, and the chiefest in the <HI>Czaslawer</HI> Circle: In this place they say that <HI>Zisca</HI> was buried, that famous <HI>Bohemian General;</HI> he lost one Eye by an <HI>Arrow,</HI> and was at length blind of both, yet gave not over the war, and proved success∣ful in it. He wished his <HI>Friends</HI> to make a <HI>Drum</HI> of his <HI>Skin,</HI> which should serve to fright away their Enemies. And though he cared not for any Sepulchral Monument, yet he had one in this place.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cottenberg.</NOTE> From <HI>Czaslaw</HI> we came to <HI>Guttenberg,</HI> or <HI>Cottenberg,</HI> about eight <HI>Bohemian</HI> miles from <HI>Prague,</HI> every mile being five or six <HI>English</HI> miles. A large Town, and much frequented, not far from the River <HI>Albis</HI> or <HI>Elbe,</HI> of especial note for the <HI>Silver Mines</HI> about it: The <HI>Hells</HI> near it are not high, and consequently the Mines are not so deep as those of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and some others in <HI>Germany;</HI> yet some are above seventy or eighty <HI>Fathoms.</HI> They have wrought at these <HI>Mines</HI> seven hundred years, and there are about thirty of them. I went down into that which was first digged, but afterwards lest for a long time, but they work there now again, it is called the <HI>Cotna,</HI> or <HI>Auf∣der Cotten,</HI> upon the <HI>Cotten,</HI> or <HI>Coat-hill;</HI> and as the Story goes a <HI>Monk</HI> walking over this Hill found a kind of a <HI>Silver Tree</HI> sticking to his Garment, which was the occasion that they afterwards digged and built these <HI>Mines,</HI> and the place retains the name of <HI>Cottenberg.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Mine</HI> into which I descended near the Town, is but nineteen <HI>Fathoms</HI> deep; the chief <HI>Vein</HI> of the <HI>Ore</HI> runs South, and is about a foot in breadth: the <HI>Ore</HI> holds or contains in it <HI>Silver</HI> and <HI>Cop∣per,</HI> so that out of an hundred pound weight of <HI>Ore,</HI> they ordinarily get an Ounce of <HI>Silver,</HI> and eight, nine, or ten ounces or more of <HI>Copper,</HI> even to pounds, but it is not well known, for the <HI>Copper-works</HI> are the Emperors. The <HI>Ʋndertakers</HI> get out what <HI>Silver</HI> they can, and afterwards sell the <HI>Ore,</HI> unto the Emperors Officers; but some <HI>Ore</HI> is so rich as to contain eight or nine ounces of <HI>Silver.</HI> A blew <HI>Earth</HI> which they meet with in digging, affords the best hopes of <HI>Ore.</HI> Two men lately perished in this <HI>Mine,</HI> having made a fire in it, being either choaked with the smoak, or, as they thought, by the poysonous ex∣halations forced out of the Minerals by the fire. I have read that <HI>Libussa</HI> the Princess, and reputed Sorceress of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> foretold many things concerning these <HI>Mines;</HI> but certain it is, that for the advan∣tage and profit these bring, the Town hath suffered much in many wars. The Emperor <HI>Sigismund</HI> made hast out of it upon the ap∣proach of <HI>Zisca,</HI> and seeing he could not hold it, burnt the Town; but it was soon rebuilt and possessed by <HI>Zisca,</HI> whose party called it the <HI>Purse of Antichrist.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prague.</NOTE> Leaving <HI>Cottenberg,</HI> I came to <HI>Colline</HI> and to <HI>Bohemian Broda,</HI> so named to distinguish it from <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>Teutonick Broda</HI> before menti∣oned, a considerable good Town, and from thence came to <HI>Prag,</HI> or <HI>Prague,</HI> the Capital and Royal City of the Kingdom of <HI>Bohemia.</HI> The <HI>Walls</HI> of this City seem to enclose the greatest Circuit of ground of
<PB N="163" REF="95"/>
any I have seen in <HI>Germany</HI> but the Hills and void spaces within it take up a large Tract, and therein it is like the City of <HI>Lyon</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> it is seated upon the River <HI>Muldau,</HI> by the <HI>Bohemians</HI> named <HI>Ʋltaue,</HI> a large rapid River, arising in the South part of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and before it arrives at <HI>Prague,</HI> receives the River <HI>Sarsua</HI> and the <HI>Watta</HI> into it; and Northward of <HI>Prague</HI> the River <HI>Egra,</HI> and joyns with the <HI>Elbe.</HI></P>
<P>This great place consists of three Towns, named the <HI>Old,</HI> the <HI>New,</HI> and the <HI>Kleine Seitten,</HI> or <HI>lesser Town.</HI> The <HI>old Town</HI> lies upon the East of the River <HI>Muldau,</HI> is very populous, full of Buildings, private and publick. Very considerable in this part is also the University, where∣in are great numbers of Students and Scholars, there being but one University in <HI>Bohemia;</HI> many persons also resorting thither from o∣ther Countries. It is scarce credible what is reported of the num∣ber of Scholars in <HI>Prague</HI> in former Ages, as hath been delivered by divers Authors. And <HI>Lewis du May,</HI> Councellor unto the Duke of <HI>Wirtenburg,</HI> affirms, That there are at present scarce so many Students in all <HI>Germany,</HI> as there were at <HI>Prague</HI> in the year 1409. when they reckoned above Forty thousand under the <HI>Rectorship</HI> of <HI>John Huss. Charles</HI> the Fourth Emperor, and King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> founded the <HI>Ʋniversity</HI> of <HI>Prague,</HI> giving equal privileges to the <HI>Bohemians, Polanders,</HI> and <HI>Germans:</HI> and when he would retrench his favours towards Strangers, there went out of the Town in a weeks time twenty four thousand Scholars, and a little after, sixteen thousand, whereby we may judge there were more Scholars in <HI>Pra∣gue</HI> than other persons in some great Citi s. There are also in this <HI>old Town</HI> divers <HI>Colleges</HI> and <HI>Cloysters.</HI> The <HI>Jesuites</HI> have a fair hand∣som <HI>College,</HI> near unto the <HI>Bridge,</HI> but the <HI>Buildings</HI> of the <HI>old Town</HI> are inferiour to those of the <HI>lesser Town.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>new Town</HI> is large, and together with the River, encompasses the <HI>old,</HI> and is divided from it by a large <HI>Trench</HI> or <HI>Ditch,</HI> into which they can let in the River. The <HI>Irish</HI> have a <HI>Cloyster</HI> of <HI>Franciscans</HI> near unto an old <HI>Tower</HI> in the <HI>Wall</HI> of the <HI>old Town.</HI> The <HI>Jesuites</HI> have also begun a large <HI>Cloyster,</HI> which, if finished according to its beginning and design, will be very spacious and noble. They are now making <HI>Bastions</HI> about the <HI>Town</HI> at one end thereof; there is al∣so a <HI>Citadel,</HI> but not finished, at <HI>Wisseraht,</HI> or <HI>Wissegrade,</HI> formerly<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Princess <HI>Libussa.</HI></NOTE> the Seat of the Princes of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and also of the famous Princess <HI>Libussa,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Crocus,</HI> and Wife unto <HI>Primislaus.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Kleine Seitten,</HI> or <HI>lesser Prague,</HI> far exceeds the other for plea∣santness and beauty of Buildings and fair Palaces. This part lies Westward of the River <HI>Muldau,</HI> which between this and the <HI>old Town,</HI> is passable by a strong <HI>Stone-bridge,</HI> consisting of sixteen great Arches, being about Seventeen hundred loot long, and Thirty five foot broad, and two open Gates under two high Towers of Stone at each end. A great part of this Town lies high, and upon the Hill stands <HI>Hrat∣schin</HI> or <HI>Ʋpper Prague,</HI> and a Summer House of the Emperors, besides a Magnificent Palace of the Emperors, as King of <HI>Bohemia;</HI> and by it a fair <HI>Cathedral Church</HI> dedicated to St. <HI>Veit,</HI> first built by St. <HI>Wen∣ceslaus,</HI> Duke of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> 923. from whence the Town and River is best viewed. In this Church are divers <HI>old Monuments</HI> for great Per∣sons; as for <HI>Pogiebrachius,</HI> a <HI>Bohemian</HI> King, <HI>Wenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>slaus▪ Rodolphus</HI> the

Second, <HI>Charles</HI> the Fourth, <HI>Ladislaus, Maximilian</HI> the Second, and other <HI>Arch-Dukes</HI> and <HI>Emperors.</HI> There are also many Houses of the <HI>Nobility</HI> in this part of the City. The Palace and Garden of <HI>Colare∣do</HI> is exceeding neat, though small. But I was most pleased with the Palace of Count <HI>Wallensteyn,</HI> Duke of <HI>Friedland,</HI> General unto the Em∣peror <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Second, who being suspected to Usurp that King∣dom, was afterwards killed at <HI>Egra.</HI> This Palace was built upon the Ruins of an hundred Houses, purposely plucked down to make room for it; wherein the Hall is large, the Garden handsom; upon one side whereof there is a place to manage Horses, and near unto it a Fish-pond: in another part there is a noble <HI>Aviary</HI> with a Garden and Trees in it, after the manner of the <HI>Aviary</HI> of Prince <HI>Doria</HI> at <HI>Genoa,</HI> which is eight∣paces long, and eighteen broad. The Stable is large, and worth the seeing, wherein there is a <HI>Marble Pillar</HI> between each Horse, and for e∣very Horse there is placed in a niche of the Wall a Rack of Steel, and Manger of Marble, and over his Head hangs a Picture of the Horse, as big as the Life, with his Name under it. Among the rest, I observed that a Bay-horse had for his Name <HI>Monte d'Oro,</HI> a Mare, <HI>Bel a donna,</HI> ano∣ther <HI>Espagnoletta,</HI> and his most beloved Horse was named <HI>Mas Queride.</HI></P>
<P>Some have thought that the best <HI>high German</HI> is spoken in this part of <HI>Prague;</HI> and there living so many of the Nobility and great Per∣sons, it is not to be wondred at, that their Language is better than ordina∣ry. But the common Language of <HI>Bohemia</HI> is a Dialect of the <HI>Scla∣vonian,</HI> though very many speak also <HI>High dutch,</HI> as we found in all our passage through that Country. <HI>Koningsmark</HI> being with his For∣ces on the Frontiers of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> a discontented Colonel of the <HI>Impe∣rialists,</HI> came unto him, making it probable that he might surprize <HI>Hratschin,</HI> and the lesser side of <HI>Prague,</HI> which he suddainly attempted, and so successfully, that he surprized many Officers, and old <HI>Cola∣redo</HI> in his Bed, getting so great a Booty, that he could scarce carry it away.</P>
<P>A Part of <HI>Prague</HI> is inhabited by Jews, and called the <HI>Jews Town;</HI> there are no small number of them, and many rich, as trading in all Commodities, and have good skill in Jewels, and several sorts of Stones digged out of the <HI>Mines</HI> in <HI>Bohemia:</HI> I bought some <HI>Boh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mian Topazes</HI> of them, neatly cut and well-figured, and some which were very large and clear, were at the rate of seven or eight <HI>Dollars.</HI> During my s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay here, I had a great desire to have saluted <HI>Johannes Marcus Marci,</HI> a famous Physician and Philosopher of <HI>Prague,</HI> and also to have indu∣ced him to a Correspondence with the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> but I understood that he had left this World, to the great grief of Learned Men in these and other parts.</P>
<P>Many here do speak still of <HI>John Huss,</HI> and <HI>Jerome</HI> of <HI>Prague,</HI> and I have seen <HI>Silver Medals</HI> of them. They were surely very notable men; and I shall only set down what <HI>Aeneas Sylvius,</HI> or Pope <HI>Pius</HI> the Second said of them. <HI>Johannes aetate major &amp; authoritate, doctrinâ, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acundi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> superior Hiero<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ymus, pertul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>runt ambo constanti animo ne∣cem, &amp; quasi ad Epulum invitati, ad incendium properarunt, nullam emit∣tentes vocem quae miseri animi posset <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erre ind cium: ubi ardere cepe∣runt, hym<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um cecinere quem vix <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lamma &amp; fragor ignis intercipere po∣tuit, nemo Philosophorum tam forti animo mo tem pertulisse tradi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uam isti incendium.

None of the old Philosophers endured their death with such a courageous mind as these the fire.</P>
<P>The same Author compares <HI>Prague</HI> unto the City of <HI>Florence</HI> in <HI>Tuscany,</HI> wherefore having seen both places, I cannot omit to say some∣thing, I had a view of the City of <HI>Florence</HI> from the top of the <HI>Do∣mo,</HI> or <HI>Cathedral,</HI> and of <HI>Prague</HI> from the Church of St <HI>Veit,</HI> upon the Hill in the lesser Town: <HI>Prague</HI> seemed to my eye to contain a far greater Circuit than <HI>Florence;</HI> it seemed also more populous, and to exceed it very much in the number of People, the Streets larger, and the Windows of Palaces and fair Houses being of Glass, looked not so tatter'dly as the ragged Paper Windows of <HI>Florence.</HI> The Ri∣ver <HI>Arno,</HI> which runs through <HI>Florence,</HI> is not to be compared with the <HI>Muldau</HI> at <HI>Prague,</HI> having run about an hundred miles from its Head. The large, massy, long Stone-Bridge exceeds any of, if not all, the four Bridges of <HI>Florence.</HI> The Emperors Palace also upon the Hill is very stately: But as for the well-paved Streets of <HI>Florence,</HI> the <HI>Domo,</HI> or <HI>Cathedral</HI> with black and white Marble, with a <HI>Cupola,</HI> second only to that of St. <HI>Peters</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> for the incomparable <HI>Chappel</HI> of St. <HI>Lau∣rence,</HI> and the <HI>Dukes Gallery</HI> and <HI>Rar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ties,</HI> I must confess I saw not any thing in <HI>Prague</HI> which a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>swered them. At <HI>Wissenberg,</HI> or the <HI>White Hill</HI> near <HI>Prague,</HI> that deciding Battel was fought <HI>Novemb.</HI> 8▪ 1620. between <HI>Frederick,</HI> Prince <HI>Palatine</HI> of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> elected King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and the Forces of the Emperor <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nand</HI> the Second, which such a deep blow unto the <HI>Protestant Party,</HI> wherein so many of <HI>Frederick</HI>'s Forces were slain and drowned in the River in their flight, wherein also that famous Commander <HI>Papenheim</HI> was found lying among the dead, who notwitstanding died not of his wounds, but was reserved to end his days with the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> in the me∣morable Battel of <HI>Lutzen.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Prague</HI> I designed to pass by water down the <HI>Muldau,</HI> which unites with the <HI>Elbe</HI> about <HI>Melni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k,</HI> and so down the <HI>El<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> unto <HI>Ham∣burg.</HI> But the Winter advancing, and the Weather proving cold, the Boats did not go as in Summer, and therefore I took my Journey by Land, and leaving <HI>Prague</HI> and the <HI>Muldau</HI> on the right hand I passed the first day to <HI>Zagethal,</HI> the next to <HI>Weluerne,</HI> and so to <HI>Budin</HI> and <HI>Labasitz</HI> upon the <HI>Elbe.</HI> Having passed over the <HI>Egra,</HI> a considerable River, arising not far from the City of <HI>Egra,</HI> and at last running into the <HI>Elbe;</HI> the next by the Castle of <HI>Kriegstein,</HI> or <HI>Warre∣stone,</HI> seated upon a high steep Rock, I came to <HI>Ausig,</HI> a small City not far from the <HI>Elbe,</HI> having little remarkable in it, like many other small Cities of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and so forward to <HI>Nolndorff,</HI> where we lodged upon Mount <HI>Kninsberg,</HI> the day after we entred into <HI>Misnia,</HI> passing by <HI>Peter∣swald</HI> and <HI>Hellendorff</HI> the first Village in <HI>Misnia,</HI> and <HI>Kisibel,</HI> where are <HI>Iron Mines</HI> about eighteen Fathomsdeep, and <HI>Iron works.</HI></P>
<P>We now understood that <HI>Bohemia</HI> was a larger Country than we expected; it lies round, and some say it is three days postage over; others that the Diameter extends two hundred miles. From <HI>Igla</HI> upon the Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ines unto <HI>Hellendorff,</HI> it took me nine days Journey in <HI>November</HI>

by <HI>Coach,</HI> not reckoning the time I staid at <HI>Prague.</HI> In many places there are very ill Passages, and so rudely mended with great Trees, laid side by side, that they are often very troublesome to pass.</P>
<P>We travelled afterwards towards <HI>Dresden,</HI> in a fruitful Country, wherein were many <HI>Deer</HI> in most parts of the way, in sight of the Castle of <HI>Pilnitz,</HI> a strong place, and seated high. I could not but cast an eye on the <HI>Rocks</HI> behind us in the Forest of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> which looked like the Ruines of a Wall which formerly enclosed <HI>Bohemia,</HI> which Country is described with a Forest or Woods round about it.</P>
<P>But I confess I did not really perceive that there was such a Wood round about it as is commonly set forth in <HI>Mapps;</HI> only both within, and also in many parts of the Borders, there are great Woods which are conceived to have been part of the <HI>Hercinian Forest.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Bohemians</HI> are a strong, stout, and hardy People, make good Souldiers, and have made wars both at home and abroad; and <HI>Histo∣ries</HI> are full of their warlike Exploits. The chief <HI>Magazine</HI> of the King is at <HI>Egra▪</HI> a strong City, accounted the Second of <HI>Bohemia.</HI> The Country affords also lusty and strong Horses. The common sort of People are boysterous, rough, and quarrelsome, especially in drink, whereto they are too much addicted. The Nobility and Gen∣try are civil and kind unto Strangers. There are many great Fami∣lies of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Nobility, among which that of <HI>Rosenberg</HI> and <HI>Popel</HI> is an∣cient, and of high esteem. Since the unhappy accepting of the Crown by <HI>Frederick</HI> Count <HI>Palatine,</HI> and the ill success upon it, there hath been a great alteration in this Country, both as to People and their Manners; for thereupon many thousands left the Kingdom, and many who remained, turned their Religion. And the Emperors have used the like severity upon others in their Hereditary Dominions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dresden.</NOTE> The next considerable place we came unto was <HI>Dresden</HI> in <HI>Misnia,</HI> as well worth the seeing as almost any Town in <HI>Germany. Dresden</HI> is the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at and Residence of the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> seated upon the River <HI>Elbe,</HI> over which there is a very noble Stone-bridge of Seventeen Ar∣ches. The City is very well fortified after the Modern way, the <HI>Bastions</HI> covered or lined with Brick, and in each <HI>Bastion</HI> a <HI>Cavallier:</HI> It hath also a large <HI>Trench</HI> or <HI>Ditch</HI> about it, in some places double; and the River <HI>Elbe</HI> adds unto its strength. The Walls are very strong: and they say, that when the first Stone was laid to build them, there was placed in the Earth a <HI>Silver Cup</HI> gilded, a <HI>Book</HI> of the <HI>Laws,</HI> and another of <HI>Coyns,</HI> and three <HI>Glasses</HI> filled with <HI>Wine.</HI> It hath also three Gates.

<P>The <HI>Armamentarium-Armory</HI> or <HI>Arsenal,</HI> is a long, square Building, wherein are about Four hundred <HI>brass Pieces</HI> of <HI>Ordnance,</HI> great num∣ber of <HI>Muskets</HI> and <HI>Armour</HI> in the upper Room, <HI>Silver Coats</HI> of <HI>Male.

<P>In the <HI>Hunting-house,</HI> in the <HI>old Town,</HI> are fifteen <HI>Bears</HI> very well provided for and looked unto.

Second, <HI>Grand Marshal</HI> of the <HI>Empire,</HI> a great and powerful Prince, who keeps a <HI>Royal Court</HI> and <HI>Attendance,</HI> having his <HI>Guards</HI> and <HI>Officers</HI> after the manner of <HI>King<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> His <HI>Dominions</HI> lie in <HI>Misnia, Thuringia, Voytland,</HI> and part of <HI>Lusatia.</HI> His <HI>Revenues</HI> are large, from <HI>Impositi∣ons</HI> upon <HI>Commodities.</HI> His <HI>Profit</HI> great, from the Tax upon <HI>Beer,</HI> which arises to no small sum, especially in <HI>Wittenberg, Torga,</HI> and <HI>Leip∣sick.</HI> And his <HI>Silv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Mines</HI> are considerable. And the <HI>Funeral</HI> of the last Elector, <HI>Joannes Georgius</HI> the First, was very magnificent 1657. at which there were twenty four <HI>Horses</HI> of <HI>State</HI> covered with <HI>black,</HI> and the Electoral <HI>Escutcheon</HI> embroydered thereon, and every one led by two Gentlemen, and three thousand five hundred persons in mourn∣ing.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Luther</HI>'s Holiday was kept when I was there. The chief Church is very fair: They preach every morning at seven a Clock. The <HI>Lu∣theran</HI> women mourn in <HI>white,</HI> as others do in <HI>Black;</HI> and the woman of the House doth ordinarily say Grace instead of the man. The best <HI>High-dutch</HI> is spoken in this place, and other parts of <HI>Misnia,</HI> which is a very pleasant fruitful Country, and full of good Towns and Villages.</P>
<P>Leaving this noble place, I took not the nearest Road, but turned out of the way unto <HI>Freiberg,</HI> a place noted for <HI>Silver Mines;</HI> whereof I<NOTE PLACE="marg">Freiberg.</NOTE> had read something in <HI>Agricola,</HI> and heard very much in these parts. About an <HI>English</HI> mile or two from <HI>Freiberg,</HI> there are many remarka∣ble <HI>Mines.</HI> I took notice of three of them: One called <HI>Auff den hohen berg,</HI> or <HI>upon the high Hill,</HI> which is the deepest in these parts, as being seventy seven of their <HI>Fathoms</HI> deep; each of their <HI>Fathoms</HI> contains twelve of their <HI>Ells,</HI> and three of their <HI>Ells</HI> makes one of our <HI>Fa∣thoms.</HI> So that the depth of this <HI>Mine</HI> exceeds any of those wherein I was in <HI>Hungary.</HI> There is another <HI>Mine</HI> called <HI>Himmelfurst,</HI> or the <HI>Prince of Heaven,</HI> wherein not long since there was <HI>Ore</HI> found so rich, as in an hundred pounds weight to contain an hundred and thirty Marks of <HI>Silver,</HI> or sixty five pounds in the hundred, but there was not much of it: And where the <HI>Veins</HI> are richest, they are observed to be thinnest, about two fingers broad; but the ordinary <HI>Ore</HI> is but poor, holding an ounce, or an ounce and half, in an hundred pounds weight; and if it holds but half an ounce they work it. Nor is this much to be wondered at, for in the vast rich <HI>Mines</HI> of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Chili,</HI> they will work the <HI>Silver Ore</HI> which contains four or five ounces in a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Silver Mines▪</NOTE> hundred pound weight; and ten or twelve ounces is the ordinary rate of the common <HI>Ore</HI> of that rich Mountain of <HI>Potosi,</HI> out of which Hill alone, if we believe <HI>Albero Alonso Barba,</HI> Curate of the Parish of St. <HI>Bernard</HI> in that City, there hath been more <HI>Silver</HI> taken than would cover all <HI>Misnia</HI> over and over: For thus he saith, Potosi <HI>hath already yielded between four and five hundred Millions of pieces of Eight.</HI> A quantity sufficient to make such another Hill of <HI>Silver:</HI> It is hard to form a conception equal unto so exorbitant a heap of Riches; but the better to help our imagination herein, I know, that if the Ground were covered with so many pieces of Eight, laid as close to one another as is possible, they would take up the space of sixty Leagues square.</P>
<P>Here at <HI>Freiberg</HI> they have many ways to open the <HI>Ore</HI> whereby it may be melted; as by <HI>Lead</HI> and a sort of <HI>Silver Ore</HI> which holds <HI>Lead</HI> in it. They have also <HI>Sulphur Ore</HI> found here, which after it is
<PB N="170" REF="103"/>
burned, doth help much towards the susion of <HI>Metals:</HI> And besides these, <HI>Slich,</HI> or pounded and washed <HI>Ore;</HI> and <HI>Slacken,</HI> which is the Dross or Cake, or Skum taken out of the <HI>Vortiegel,</HI> or <HI>Pan</HI> which re∣ceives the <HI>melted Minerals,</HI> let out at the bottom of the <HI>melting Furnace.</HI> Their <HI>Treibshearth,</HI> or <HI>driving Furnace,</HI> where the <HI>Litharge</HI> is driven off, agrees better with the Figure of it in <HI>Agricola,</HI> than those of <HI>Hungary:</HI> Some of the <HI>Litharge</HI> is green: Their <HI>Buck-work</HI> and their <HI>Engines</HI> which pound the <HI>Ore,</HI> the <HI>Coal,</HI> and <HI>Clay,</HI> are also very neat. Much of their <HI>Ore</HI> is washed, especially the poorest, and that which is mixed with <HI>stones, quarts,</HI> or <HI>sparrs.</HI></P>
<P>This is peculiar in their working, that they burn the pounded and washed <HI>Ore</HI> in the <HI>Roasthearth,</HI> before they melt it in the <HI>Smeltzoven,</HI> or <HI>melting Furnace.</HI></P>
<P>At those <HI>Mines</HI> of <HI>Hungary</HI> where I was, they used not the <HI>Virgula divina,</HI> or forked Hazel, to find out <HI>Silver Ore</HI> or hidden Treasure in the Earth; and I should little depend thereon: but here they have an e∣steem of it. And I observed the use thereof, and the manner how they did it. But I shall omit the Description of it, because it is set down in divers Books, and it cannot be so well described as shown to the Eye.</P>
<P>I saw also another <HI>Mine,</HI> called <HI>Auff der Halsbrucker,</HI> about eighty of our <HI>Fathoms</HI> deep, and much worked: They have divers sorts of <HI>Ore;</HI> but they contain either <HI>Silver</HI> and <HI>Copper, Silver</HI> and <HI>Lead,</HI> or all three; but they work them only for <HI>Silver.</HI> They have divers <HI>damps</HI> in these <HI>Mines,</HI> where it is deep. The <HI>Mines</HI> are cold where the out∣ward Air comes in; but where not, warm. The greatest trouble they have is by dust, which spoils their <HI>Lungs</HI> and <HI>Stomachs,</HI> and frets their <HI>Skins.</HI> But they are not so much troubled with water; and have ve∣ry<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brimstone Mines.</NOTE> good <HI>Engines</HI> to draw the water out.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sulphur</HI> or <HI>Brimstone Ore</HI> which is found here, is also rich; it is hard and stony, as other <HI>Ores</HI> are; that which hath <HI>red spots</HI> is ac∣counted the best. They use a peculiar <HI>Furnace</HI> to melt the <HI>Brimstone</HI> from the <HI>Ore;</HI> some whereof yields three pounds of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> out of an hundred weight of <HI>Ore,</HI> which as it melts, runs out of the <HI>Furnace</HI> into water, or the Exhalations from the <HI>Ore</HI> near or in the Fire, are con∣densed into <HI>Brimstone</HI> by the Surface of the Water placed to receive it; this is once again melted and purified. Some of the <HI>Brimstone Ore</HI> contains <HI>Silver,</HI> some <HI>Copper,</HI> and some both in a small proporti∣on.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Sulphur</HI> is melted from the <HI>Ore,</HI> the remainder serves for two uses; that is, either for the melting of <HI>Silver,</HI> or for the ma∣king of <HI>Vitriol:</HI> To the former only thus; A proportion is cast into the melting <HI>Furnace</HI> of the <HI>Silver,</HI> to this end, to use the <HI>Miners</HI> ex∣pression to make the <HI>Silver</HI> which is hard, fluid.</P>
<P>The other use, and which is more considerable, is for the making of <HI>Vitriol,</HI> or <HI>Copperose</HI> in this manner: They take the <HI>Ore,</HI> out of which the <HI>Brimstone</HI> hath been already melted, and burn it once again, or let it still burn in the open Air; then putting it into a large Fatt, they pour water upon it, so as to imbibe and drink in the <HI>Vitriol;</HI> this Wa∣ter is afterwards boyled to a sufficient height, and let out into the Coolers, where sticks are set in it, as in the making of <HI>Sugar Candy:</HI> The purest Crystallized <HI>Vitriol</HI> sticks unto the wood, the rest to the

sides and bottom. Thus the <HI>Sulphur Ore,</HI> after the <HI>Sulphur</HI> is taken out of it, still works upon the <HI>Silver Ore,</HI> and opens the Body of it in the Fire; but when this <HI>Ore</HI> is also deprived of its <HI>Vitriol,</HI> it works no more upon <HI>Metals.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friberg,</HI> is a round well-walled City; hath handsom Streets, a <HI>Piaz∣za,</HI> the Elector's Castle; and five Gates. The Church of St. <HI>Peter</HI> is fair, where many of the Dukes and Ducal Family have been buried, and have fair Monuments; especiall▪ Duke <HI>Mauritius</HI> Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> whose Monument in <HI>black Marble</HI> is raised three piles high, adorned with many fair <HI>Statua's</HI> in <HI>Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>baster</HI> and <HI>white Marble,</HI> and esteemed one of the noblest, if not the best, in <HI>Germany.</HI> And when this Town was surrendered unto <HI>Holck</HI> and <HI>Gallas, Octob.</HI> 5. 1632▪ the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> paid 80000 <HI>Dollars</HI> to save the Monuments of his Predecessours from being ransacked and desaced, it being the fashion of divers <HI>German</HI> Princes to be buried in their <HI>Robes,</HI> with their <HI>Ensigns</HI> of <HI>Honour, Rings, Jewels,</HI> and the like, which would have been booty, and probably have run the same fortune as the <HI>Cloister</HI> of <HI>Haibr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> with∣in twelve <HI>English</HI> miles of <HI>Nurenberg</HI> where some of the Marquisses of <HI>Onspach,</HI> who are of the Electoral House of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> lie entomb∣ed, where <HI>Tilly</HI>'s Souldiers brake open the <HI>Vault,</HI> and robbed the <HI>dead Corpses</HI> of the Marquisses, <HI>George Frederick,</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>achim Ernest,</HI> of the <HI>Jewels, Rings</HI> and other rich <HI>Ornaments</HI> with which they were entom∣bed.</P>
<P>There are some Vaults and Subterraneous Cavities in the City, by which there are passages into the <HI>Mines.</HI> This place was formerly streightly besieged by the Emperor <HI>Adolphus,</HI> for the space of a year and a month, and at last betrayed by a <HI>Fugitive,</HI> who let in a party of the Emperors into the Town by a Subterraneous Passage near St. <HI>Donats</HI> Gate, and upon the continual Batteries made at the Town, and concussion of the Earth about it, the Earth sunk down in many places, and swallowed great numbers of the Emperors Army.</P>
<P>These <HI>Mines</HI> afford great benefit unto the City, and also unto the Elector; They are said to have been found out in the year 1180. But there have been other <HI>Silver Mines</HI> discovered since; as at <HI>Schneeberg,</HI> at <HI>Anneberg</HI> and at <HI>Joachims Dale,</HI> 1526.</P>

<P><HI>Leipsick</HI> is seated upon the River <HI>Elster,</HI> which arising in <HI>Voytland,</HI> or <HI>Terra Advocatorum,</HI> passes by it, and afterwards runs into the River <HI>Sala.</HI> It is a rich and great trading City; hath three <HI>Marts</HI> in the year, and great resort unto it from many parts: It is well built, and divers <HI>Houses</HI> are seven stories high. The <HI>Castle</HI> is strictly guarded, and hath in it a strong white Tower. But the Works about the Town are not very considerable, although they might be made strong.</P>
<P>The Church of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> is well adorned, and hath the name to be the fairest within side of any <HI>Lutheran</HI> Church in <HI>Germany;</HI> they have also a remarkable <HI>Burial-place</HI> or <HI>Godtsaker,</HI> walled about, and cloy∣stered near the Wall, wherein the better sort are buried, as the rest in the middle and open part. Which put me in mind of that noble <HI>Burial-place,</HI> which I saw at <HI>Pisa</HI> in <HI>Tuscany,</HI> called <HI>Il campo Santo,</HI> be∣cause the Earth which the Emperor <HI>Frederick Barbarossa</HI> brought
<PB N="172" REF="106"/>
from the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> for the Ballast of his Ships, was laid upon that Ground.</P>
<P><HI>Leipsick</HI> is famous for two great Battels fought near unto it, in the last <HI>Swedish</HI> wars; one between <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and Count <HI>Tilly,</HI> General of the <HI>Imperialists,</HI> 1631. wherein the <HI>Swedes</HI> obtained a great Victory. <HI>Tilly</HI> was wounded, fled and lived not long after. Another some years after in the same place, wherein <HI>Leonard Torstenson</HI> the <HI>Swede,</HI> overcame Arch-duke <HI>Leopoldus Gulielmus,</HI> and <HI>Octavio Piccolomini,</HI> Generals of the <HI>Imperial Army.</HI> And about a mile and a half from hence, at <HI>Lutzen,</HI> another great Battel was fought, 1632. between the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> and the <HI>Imperial Army,</HI> command∣ed by <HI>Albert Wallensteyn</HI> Duke of <HI>Friedland,</HI> wherein the <HI>Swedes</HI> ob∣tained the Victory, but the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was slain; and on the <HI>Im∣perial</HI> side that famous Commander, <HI>Godfrey</HI> Count of <HI>Pappenheim.</HI></P>
<P>There is also an <HI>Ʋniversity</HI> at <HI>leipsick,</HI> first occasioned by the <HI>Ger∣man</HI> Scholars of <HI>Prague,</HI> who in the troubles of the <HI>Hussites</HI> came hi∣ther, to the number of Two thousand in one day; and is still one of the <HI>Three Ʋniversities</HI> in the Elector's Dominions; the other being <HI>Je∣na</HI> by the River <HI>Sala,</HI> and <HI>Wittenberg</HI> upon the <HI>Elbe.</HI> In this <HI>Ʋniver∣sity</HI> they are much addicted to the study of the <HI>Law,</HI> but there are also Learned men in other Faculties.</P>
<P>The Magistrates of <HI>Leipsick</HI> are also considerable. <HI>Der herr von Ad∣lershelme</HI> was the <HI>Burgomaster,</HI> a courteous Learned Person, and great <HI>Virtuoso,</HI> who had collected and observed many things: He hath had five fair Daughters brought up in all commendable ways of working, <HI>Drawing, Painting, Inlaying</HI> with <HI>Flowers,</HI> with <HI>Mother</HI> of <HI>Pearl, Stones,</HI> and other pretty <HI>Works.</HI> And they spake divers <HI>Languages,</HI> which they learned at a School in <HI>Holland:</HI> So that his house hath a great deal of excellent Furniture of his Childrens work, and is one of the most considerable Curiosities to be seen in <HI>Leipsick.</HI> His <HI>Summer-house</HI> is handsom, painted both within and without: And in the Water about, are <HI>Muscovy Ducks, Indian Geese,</HI> and divers rare <HI>Fowls.</HI> In his <HI>Cham∣ber</HI> of <HI>Rareties</HI> there are many things considerable: But having seen divers of them in other places, and lately set down some <HI>Varieties</HI> of the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> I shall mention but a few.</P>
<P>An <HI>Elephant</HI>'s <HI>Head</HI> with the <HI>dentes molares</HI> in it. An <HI>Animal</HI> like an <HI>Armadillo,</HI> but the Scales are much larger, and the Tail broader. Very large <HI>flying Fishes.</HI> A <HI>Sea-horse. Bread</HI> of <HI>Mount Libanus.</HI> A <HI>Cedar-branch</HI> with the <HI>Fruit</HI> upon it. Large <HI>Granates</HI> as they grow in the <HI>Mine.</HI> A <HI>Sire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s hand.</HI> A <HI>Chameleon.</HI> A piece of <HI>Iron,</HI> which seems to be the <HI>head</HI> of a <HI>Spear,</HI> found in the <HI>Tooth</HI> of an <HI>Elephant,</HI> the <HI>Tooth</HI> being grown about it. The <HI>Isle</HI> of <HI>Jersey</HI> drawn by our King Charles the Second. A piece of <HI>Wood</HI> with the <HI>Blood</HI> of King <HI>Charles</HI> the First upon it. A <HI>Greenland Lance</HI> with a large <HI>Bell</HI> at the end of it. Much <HI>Japan</HI> painting, wherein their manner of <HI>hunting</HI> and <HI>working</HI> may be observed. A <HI>Picture</HI> of our <HI>Saviour,</HI> the <HI>Hatches</HI> of which are writing, or written, and contain the <HI>story</HI> of his <HI>Passion. Bevers</HI> taken in the River <HI>Elbe.</HI> A <HI>Picture</HI> of the <HI>murther</HI> of the <HI>Innocents,</HI> done by <HI>Albert Durer. Pictures</HI> of divers strange <HI>Fowls.</HI> A <HI>Greenland Boat.</HI> The Skins of white <HI>Bears, Tigres, Wolves,</HI> and other <HI>Beasts.</HI> And I must not omit the <HI>Garter</HI> of an <HI>English Bride,</HI> with the story of it; of the Fashion in <HI>England</HI> for the Bridemen to take it off, and wear it in their
<PB N="173" REF="106"/>
Hat, which seemed so strange to the <HI>Germans,</HI> that I was obliged to confirm it to them, by assuring them that I had divers times wore such a <HI>Garter</HI> my self.</P>
<P>Leaving this busy and trading City of <HI>Leipsick,</HI> I directed my Jour∣ney unto <HI>Magdeburg,</HI> and travelled through a plain Country, between the River <HI>Sala</HI> and the <HI>Elbe,</HI> by <HI>Landsberg,</HI> nigh to <HI>Petersdorff,</HI> where there is a small Hill which overlooks all the Country, next to <HI>Koehten,</HI> the Residence of the Prince of <HI>Anhalt,</HI> then to <HI>Caln,</HI> and over the River <HI>Sa∣la,</HI> before it runs into the <HI>Elbe,</HI> which arising at <HI>Mount Fichtelberg,</HI> now hastens towards it. <HI>Fichtelberg</HI> is a considerable Mountain, near which are divers <HI>Mines, Baths,</HI> and <HI>Mineral-waters,</HI> of which <HI>Gasper B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uschi∣us</HI> hath written a Description. And from it arise four Rivers, running to the four quarters of the World. The <HI>Maine</HI> or <HI>Maenus,</HI> towards the West; the <HI>Nab</HI> or <HI>Nabus,</HI> towards the South; the <HI>Aeger</HI> towards the East; and the forementioned <HI>Sala</HI> towards the North. These four af∣terwards fall into the three greatest Rivers of <HI>Germany,</HI> the <HI>Danube,</HI> the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and the <HI>Elbe.</HI> Then to <HI>Sals</HI> or <HI>Saltz,</HI> a place noted for Salt∣springs, and that night to <HI>Magdeburg.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Magdeburg.</NOTE> <HI>Parthenopolis,</HI> or <HI>Magdeburg,</HI> is seated by the River <HI>Elle,</HI> formerly the Metropolitan City of <HI>Germany,</HI> now under the Marquiss of <HI>Bran∣denburg,</HI> of very great Circuit, but little more than half built again, since it was sacked and burnt by <HI>Tilly,</HI> and Thirty six thousand persons put to the Sword and destroyed. I could not but observe the ruinous and destructive effects of the late wars in many parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> but not in any so great and flourishing a place as this: And a man might think, that after this great destruction of Houses and People, this place should not be able to stand a Siege; yet a few years after, it was besieged by General <HI>Hatzfield,</HI> unto whom <HI>(Bannier</HI> the <HI>Swede</HI> not being able to relieve it) it was yielded. The <HI>Cathedral Church</HI> is ve∣ry fair, and built like an <HI>English</HI> one, by the Emperor <HI>Otho</HI> the First, and his Empress <HI>Editha,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Woman▪ Daughter unto King <HI>Ed∣mund,</HI> whose <HI>Effigies</HI> in Stone I saw in the Church, with nineteen Tuns of <HI>Gold</HI> by her, which she gave thereto. And to say the truth, <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> money hath done great things in <HI>Germany,</HI> for hereby, or with a good part thereof, this Church was built or endowed. <HI>Leopoldus,</HI> Duke of <HI>Austria,</HI> built the old <HI>Walls</HI> of <HI>Vienna</HI> with the ransom of King <HI>Richard</HI> the First, whom he detained in his return through <HI>Au∣stria</HI> from the <HI>Holy Land.</HI> King <HI>Edward</HI> the First sent a great Sum of Money unto the Emperor <HI>Adolphus,</HI> for the raising of Souldiers in <HI>Germany,</HI> which the Emperor employed in purchasing a great part of <HI>Misnia</HI> for himself.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lutheran</HI> Churches are handsom, and their Pulpits are extra∣ordinary noble, and richly set off, as I observed, through all <HI>Saxony, Norimberg,</HI> and where they are Masters of the Places, and have not their Churches only by permission; here they shewed me in the <HI>Ca∣thedral Church</HI> of St. <HI>Maurice,</HI> the <HI>Statua's</HI> of the <HI>five wise Virgins</HI> smil∣ing, and of the <HI>five foolish Virgins</HI> lamenting, which are very well ex∣pressed: They shewed me also two odd Reliques, which they still kept as <HI>Rareties;</HI> that is, the <HI>Bason</HI> wherein <HI>Pilate</HI> washed his hands, when he declared himself free from the Blood of our <HI>Saviour;</HI> and the <HI>Ladder</HI> whereon the <HI>Cock</HI> stood when he crowed after St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s denying of Christ.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="107"/>
In the <HI>Ruines</HI> of the <HI>Cloister</HI> of the <HI>Augustines,</HI> there is still to be seen <HI>Luther's Chamber,</HI> his <HI>Bedstead,</HI> and <HI>Table,</HI> and upon the <HI>Door</HI> are these <HI>German</HI> Verses.</P>

</LG>
<P>I lodged at <HI>Magdeburg,</HI> in an old man's House, who would tell me many stories of the <HI>burning</HI> of the <HI>Town,</HI> the <HI>cruelties</HI> and <HI>bloody usage</HI> of the <HI>people,</HI> who were destroyed without exception: The <HI>Nuns,</HI> ma∣ny of them being drowned in the River <HI>Elbe.</HI> Alter which some ob∣served that Count <HI>Tilly</HI> never prospered in his Wars. He told me al∣so that <HI>Dureus</HI> lodged with him, who was employed by King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, to endeavour a reconciliation between the <HI>Lutherans</HI> and <HI>Calvinists</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> and to unite them if possible. We were now in the Territory of the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg. Fridericus Wilhelmus,</HI> Great Chamberlain of the Empire, who is in effect possessed of <HI>Mag∣deburg,</HI> and next unto the <HI>Austrian Family,</HI> is the most potent Prince in <HI>Germany,</HI> being able to raise great <HI>Armies,</HI> and his <HI>Dominions</HI> so large, that they are reckoned to extend two hundred <HI>German</HI> miles in length, from the further part of <HI>Prussia</HI> unto <HI>Cleve,</HI> but they lay not together, but interspersed with many other Princes Countries: How∣soever, a Horse-man may so order his Journey, as to lie every night in one of the Electors Towns, in travelling from one end of his Territo∣ries to another.</P>
<P>I had now left the <HI>pure German Language</HI> behind me, for at <HI>Magde∣burg</HI> comes in another kind of <HI>German,</HI> called <HI>Plat-Deutch, Broad-Dutch, Niedersachsische,</HI> or the <HI>Language of lower Saxony;</HI> a great <HI>Lan∣guage,</HI> spoken in the North part of <HI>Germany:</HI> They speak it at <HI>Ham∣burg, Dantzick, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubeck,</HI> and many great Cities: But they can con∣verse with the other <HI>High-dutch,</HI> and with some difficulty also with the <HI>Netherlanders;</HI> the one speaking in his <HI>Language,</HI> and the other replying in his.</P>
<P>At this City of <HI>Magdelurg</HI> was performed the first <HI>Turnament</HI> that was in <HI>Germany,</HI> which was opened in the year 635. by the Emperor <HI>Henry,</HI> Surnamed the <HI>Fowler,</HI> who coming from the War of <HI>Hungary,</HI> exceedingly satisfied with the <HI>Nobility,</HI> would oblige them to exercise themselves in handling their <HI>Arms,</HI> and managi g their <HI>Horses,</HI> and therefore instituted these <HI>Sports,</HI> whereby the <HI>Nobility</HI> was powerfully attracted to <HI>Valour</HI> and <HI>Gallantry,</HI> and induced to perfect and accom∣plish themselves in all kind of <HI>Chevalry.</HI> No new <HI>Nobility,</HI> no <HI>Bastard,</HI> no <HI>Ʋsurper,</HI> none guilty of <HI>High Treason,</HI> no <HI>Oppressor</HI> of <HI>Widows</HI> and <HI>Orphans,</HI> none born of <HI>Parents</HI> whereof one was of <HI>base Extraction</HI> and

<HI>Ignoble,</HI> no <HI>Heretique, Murderer, Traytor,</HI> no <HI>Coward</HI> that had run a∣way from the <HI>Battel,</HI> nor <HI>indiscreet Person</HI> that had given <HI>offence</HI> to <HI>Ladies</HI> by <HI>word</HI> or <HI>deed,</HI> were admitted to this <HI>Honour,</HI> nor above <HI>One</HI> of the same <HI>Family</HI> at a time. <HI>Princes</HI> came into the <HI>Lists</HI> with <HI>four Squries</HI> a piece, <HI>Counts</HI> and <HI>Bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns</HI> with <HI>three,</HI> a <HI>Knight</HI> with <HI>two,</HI> and a <HI>Gentleman</HI> with <HI>one.</HI></P>
<P>The hour and place for the <HI>Turnamen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> being appointed, he that had a desire to break a <HI>Lance</HI> there, came to the <HI>President</HI>'s <HI>Lodgings</HI> to have his <HI>Name</HI> written down, which was done in the presence of three <HI>Heralds,</HI> to whom the <HI>Champion</HI> delivered his <HI>Helmet</HI> and <HI>Sword,</HI> and after he had been at confession, presented himself in the <HI>Lists</HI> with one or more <HI>Squires,</HI> according to his quality. The <HI>Hor∣ses</HI> of the <HI>Combatants</HI> were to be without fault or exception; the <HI>Ca∣parisons</HI> and <HI>Furniture</HI> such as gave no offence; their <HI>Saddles</HI> without any extraordinary rising before and behind, and all things equal. Af∣ter which they performed all kind of <HI>Exercises</HI> on <HI>Horse back:</HI> and after the <HI>Jousts</HI> were ended, every man repaired to the <HI>President</HI> of his <HI>Nation,</HI> to wait for the <HI>Sentence</HI> of the <HI>Judg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s;</HI> and he that best deserved the <HI>Prize,</HI> received it either from the hand of some <HI>Lady,</HI> or from the <HI>Prince</HI> that gave it.</P>
<P>These <HI>Pastimes</HI> were afterwards disused, upon the Emulation it cau∣sed between the <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>Nobility,</HI> who strove to outvy one ano∣ther; or upon wars, in which there was no leisure for such <HI>Exercises;</HI> or perhaps upon consideration that divers <HI>brave men</HI> lost their <HI>lives</HI> in these <HI>Encounters:</HI> and no less a <HI>Prince</HI> than <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, King of <HI>France,</HI> neglecting to wear his <HI>Beaver</HI> down, was slain in a <HI>Turnament.</HI> And at <HI>Darmstadt</HI> also, in the year 1403. at the Three and twentieth <HI>Turnament</HI> which was held in <HI>Germany,</HI> the Gentlemen of <HI>Franconia</HI> and those of <HI>Hesse,</HI> drew so much blood upon one another, that there remained dead upon the place seventeen of the former, and nine of the latter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Winter</HI> growing on called me to make haste to <HI>Hamburg,</HI> from whence I intended to pass by Sea into <HI>England,</HI> and therefore I took the advantage of the <HI>Stage-Coaches</HI> at <HI>Magdeburg,</HI> and in four days came to <HI>Hamburg.</HI> I traveled through a Country for the most part barren, of little accommodation, or scarce any thing very remarkable, through part of the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> and then through the Duke of <HI>Lunenburg</HI>'s Country, passing by the City of <HI>Lunenburg,</HI> a hand∣som walled City, beautified with divers fair <HI>Churches,</HI> with high <HI>Spires.</HI> The <HI>Church</HI> of St. <HI>Lambert,</HI> the <HI>Town-house,</HI> and the <HI>Duke</HI>'s <HI>Palace,</HI> are fair. Here are <HI>salt-springs</HI> in the <HI>Town,</HI> very beneficial to the place, and supplying the <HI>neighbour Countries.</HI> The <HI>Town</HI> is commanded by a <HI>Hill</HI> near to it, called <HI>Kalkberg,</HI> which lies on the North-side.</P>
<P>In this Road through <HI>lower Saxony,</HI> I could not but take notice of many <HI>Barrows</HI> or <HI>Mounts</HI> of <HI>Earth,</HI> the burial <HI>Monuments</HI> of great and famous <HI>Men,</HI> to be often observed also in open Countries in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and sometimes rows of great <HI>Stones,</HI> like those in <HI>Wormius</HI> his <HI>Da∣nish Antiquities:</HI> And in one place I took more particular notice of them, where three massy <HI>Stones</HI> in the middle, were encompassed in a large square by other large <HI>Stones</HI> set up on end.</P>
<P><HI>Hamburg</HI> is a fair <HI>City,</HI> and one of the great ones in <HI>Germany;</HI> it is seated in a <HI>Plain,</HI> being populous, rich and remarkably strong: It is

fortified according to the modern manner, much after the way of <HI>Holland,</HI> with <HI>works</HI> of <HI>earth,</HI> but in no place yet covered or faced with <HI>brick</HI> or <HI>stone:</HI> The <HI>Territory</HI> belonging to it is but small; it is divi∣ded into the <HI>new</HI> and the <HI>old Town.</HI> There are five <HI>Gates:</HI> The <HI>Stone gate,</HI> leading towards <HI>Lubeck;</HI> the <HI>Dome-gate;</HI> the <HI>Alten-gate,</HI> or which leads unto <HI>Altenaw,</HI> a place near the <HI>Town,</HI> belonging to the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> where the <HI>Romanists</HI> and <HI>Calvinists</HI> have their <HI>Churches;</HI> the <HI>Bridge-gate;</HI> and the <HI>Dike-gate.</HI> The <HI>Buildings</HI> of this City are handsom, and commonly have a fair entrance into them. The <HI>Senate-house</HI> is noble, adorned with carved <HI>Statua's</HI> of the <HI>Nine Worthies.</HI> The <HI>Exchange</HI> or place of meeting for <HI>Merchants,</HI> was then enlarging, it being too small to receive those <HI>Numbers</HI> which fre∣quented it.

<P>I found a Ship at <HI>Hamburg</HI> bound for <HI>London,</HI> and while it was fit∣ting for Sail, I made a short <HI>excursion</HI> into part of the King of <HI>Den∣marks</HI> Country; and returning to <HI>Hamburg</HI> again, I ordered my af∣fairs for <HI>England</HI> upon the first wind, and hoped the next <HI>Tide</HI> to get over the <HI>Altenaw-sand,</HI> and to pass the <HI>Blanckness,</HI> but a cross wind prevented, so that I left not <HI>Hamburg</HI> till the tenth of <HI>December,</HI> and then I had the good company of Mr. <HI>Hoyle,</HI> who came from <HI>Narva,</HI> and set Sail in a new Ship; but the days being at the shortest, and the nights dark in the <HI>New-Moon,</HI> the <HI>Tide</HI> falling also in the day time,

Two or three days after, with a cold North-East-wind, we set sail for <HI>England.</HI> Coming out of the <HI>Elbe,</HI> we were all the Afternoon in sight of an Island, called <HI>Hei∣lige-landt,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge-landt▪</NOTE> or <HI>Holy-land,</HI> belonging to the Duke of <HI>Holstein,</HI> which being very high Land, is to be seen at a good distance, and is of excel∣lent use to direct and guide Ships into the Mouth of the <HI>Elbe,</HI> with∣out which they would be at a great loss, the Country about that Ri∣vers Mouth being all very low Land.</P>
<P><HI>Heiligeland</HI> is a small <HI>Island,</HI> having about two thousand <HI>Inhabi∣tants,</HI> and six or seven small <HI>Vessels</HI> belonging to it, which are imploy∣ed a great part of the year in bringing <HI>Lobsters</HI> and other <HI>Fish</HI> to <HI>Lon∣don</HI> or <HI>Quinborough,</HI> the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> living most upon <HI>Fish.</HI> We bore out to Sea all night, and the next day made towards the Land again, and sailed in sight of <HI>Schiemoniekeoghe, Amelandt,</HI> and <HI>Schelling:</HI> in the Evening we saw the Lights at the <HI>Vly</HI> and <HI>Texel;</HI> when we were near the Land, we were much troubled with the Frost and cold Wea∣ther, and less when we were off at Sea. The next day we had a fair wind, and made such way, that in the Evening we took down our Sails, and let the <HI>Vessel</HI> drive, not being willing to deal with the shoar in the night. The next morning we soon discovered the <HI>North foreland</HI> covered with Snow and came to an Anchor in <HI>Margaret</HI>▪Road, where the wind growing very high, we rode it out for two days and two nights, and came safe on shoar (praised be God) upon <HI>Christmas-day</HI> morning.</P>
<P>Now having made so long a walk in <HI>Germany,</HI> I must confess I re∣turned with a better opinion of the Country, than I had before of it; and cannot but think it very considerable in many things. The Ri∣vers thereof are noble, and seem to exceed those of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI> Of the Rivers of <HI>Italy,</HI> the <HI>Padus</HI> or <HI>Po,</HI> is the most considerable, which notwithstanding, hath no very long course, before it runs into the
<PB N="178" REF="109"/>
<HI>Adriatick Sea.</HI> And <HI>Italy</HI> being divided by the <HI>Appennine-bills,</HI> run∣ing from West to East, the Rivers which arise from either side, cannot be long, neither on the South-side, before they run into the <HI>Mediter∣ranean,</HI> as the <HI>Arno, Garigliano,</HI> and others: Nor on the North side, before they run into the <HI>Adriatick,</HI> or the <HI>Po.</HI></P>
<P>The chief Rivers of <HI>France,</HI> as the <HI>Loyre,</HI> the <HI>Seine,</HI> the <HI>Rhosne,</HI> and the <HI>Garonne,</HI> I cannot but highly commend, having passed upon them for divers days. There are also four great Rivers in <HI>Germany;</HI> the <HI>Danube,</HI> the <HI>Rhine,</HI> the <HI>Elbe,</HI> and the <HI>Oder,</HI> but none of <HI>France</HI> seem comparable unto the <HI>Rhine</HI> and <HI>Danube. France</HI> having the Sea upon the North, the West, and the two large Provinces of <HI>Languedoc,</HI> and <HI>Province</HI> upon the <HI>Mediterranean Sea,</HI> hath the opportunity of Noble Cities and Seaports: But some doubt may be made, Whether any thereof do exceed <HI>Hamburg, Lubeck,</HI> and <HI>Dantzick.</HI></P>
<P>The great number of populous, large, and handsome Cities, doth afford great content unto a <HI>Traveller</HI> in <HI>Germany;</HI> for besides about Sixty six free Imperial Cities, there are many more of good note be∣longing to particular Princes, and divers highly priviledged. And sure∣ly a true Estimation of the Cities and Towns of these days, cannot be duly made from the Accounts and Descriptions thereof lest an hundred years since or more, for since those times, Buildings have been better modelled and ordered; Fortifications and Out-works more regularly contrived; Convents and Publick Houses more neatly and commodi∣ously built; and the fair Colleges and Churches of the <HI>Jesuites,</HI> which are now to be seen in most, do much set off the Beauty of great Places. Every where we meet with great and populous <HI>Towns Villages; Castles, Seats</HI> of the <HI>Nobility, Plains, Forests,</HI> and pleasant <HI>Woods.</HI> And be∣sides the satisfaction we may have from Objects above ground, we may find no small content in the wonders thereof under it, in <HI>Mines, Mi∣nerals</HI> almost of all sorts, of <HI>Gold, Silver, Copper, Iron, Tinn, Lead, Quicksilver, Antimony, Coal, Salt, Sulphur, Cadmia,</HI> and others, where there are also singular <HI>Artificers</HI> and <HI>Workmen,</HI> in the several Artifices thereof. Con∣versation with the People is easie, they behaving themselves without much Formality, and are plain dealing and trusty, so that a <HI>Traveller</HI> needs not to be so sollicitous and heedful of what he hath, as in some other Countries, which are esteemed of greater Civility. The Women are generally well-complexioned, sober, and grave, and they have not yet learned the custom of their Neighbours of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> to admit of being saluted by Men: faithful to their Husbands, and careful in the affairs of their Houses.</P>
<P>They make good provision against the cold of their Country, by sleeping between two Feather-beds and Stoves.</P>
<P>The common <HI>Stoves</HI> in <HI>Inns,</HI> wherein there are for the most part several Companies eating, drinking, and in the night sleeping, are con∣venient, considering the great cold, or at least tolerable; but they be∣ing rooms close shut up, the smell of the meat, and especially of <HI>Cab∣bage,</HI> an usual Dish amongst them, makes them unpleasant, so that sometimes I preferred the course of hot Countries, while I called to mind, that in <HI>Province,</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> we drank frozen <HI>Julebs,</HI> which we dissolved with the heat of our hands; slept upon a sheet, on the outside of the Bed, with all the Windows of the Chamber open; and as we sate at dinner, there was a Fann in the middle of the Room, hanging
<PB N="179" REF="109"/>
over our Heads, about two yards broad, which with a string was pull∣ed backward and forward to cool us, and divers had Pans filled with Snow, to cool the sheets when they went into their Beds.</P>
<P><HI>Germany</HI> is a great <HI>Hive</HI> of men, and the mighty destruction of men made by the last <HI>German</HI> wars, and by the Plague is so repaired, that it is scarce discernible. They are fruitful, and full of Children: They are not exhausted by <HI>Sea,</HI> Colonies sent forth, or by peopling <HI>American Countries▪</HI> but they have some consumption by wars abroad, when they be at peace at home: few wars being made in other parts of <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> wherein there are not some Regiments of <HI>Germans;</HI> the People being naturally Martial, and persons well descended, very averse from a Trading course of Life.</P>
<P>While I read in <HI>Tacitus</HI> of the old barbarous and rude State of <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> how poorly they lived, that they had their Houses at a distance from one another; how ignorant they were in Arts; and it was doubted whether their Country afforded <HI>Mines;</HI> that they lived by ex∣change of things, making little or no use of money, and the like, I may justly wonder to behold the present advance and improvement in all commendable Arts, Learning, Civility, splendid and handsome Cities and Habitations, and the general face of things incredibly altered since those ancient times; and cannot but approve the expression of a Learned Man, though long since, <HI>That if</HI> Ariovistus, Civilis, <HI>and those old famous men of</HI> Germany, <HI>should revive in their Country again, and look up to Heaven, beholding the Constellations of the Bears, and other Stars, they might probably acknowledge that these were the same Stars which they were wont to behold; but if they should look downward, and well view the face of all things, they would imagine themselves to be in a new World, and never acknowledge this to have been their Country.</HI></P>

They use also an Instru∣ment of Wood, pierced with many holes, to help to cool them sooner, or to stir the Water when any one goes in, whereby he is not so sensible of the heat. There are many cold <HI>Springs</HI> rise near these hot ones, whereby they might be tempered; and surely the quantity of the hot Water being so great, no place might be made more delightful, nor no <HI>Baths</HI> more Noble. The <HI>Turks</HI> in our times, do most of any Nation beautifie their <HI>Baths,</HI> and render them serviceable to their Health and pleasure.</P>
<P>In <HI>Austria</HI> at <HI>Baden,</HI> the <HI>Sawer Bath</HI> is built after the <HI>Turkish</HI> manner, with a <HI>Cupola</HI> over it: and if any one hereafter shall build or beautify these, they will yield to very few in <HI>Europe.</HI> At present most of them are of a square Figure, of about five or six yards over; and the Houses in which they are, very near one another.

<P>Within two Leagues of <HI>Aken,</HI> in the Country of <HI>Limbourg,</HI> is a <HI>Mine</HI> of <HI>Lapis Calaminaris,</HI> which we went to see having a <HI>Corporal</HI> and eight <HI>Musquetiers</HI> for our Security to pass the <HI>Wood.</HI> This <HI>Mine</HI> lies over against the Castle of <HI>Einenberg.</HI> As soon as I had delivered a <HI>Letter</HI> to Mr. <HI>John Franck,</HI> Comptroller of the <HI>Mine</HI> for his <HI>Catholick Majesty,</HI> he went along with us, to shew us the manner how the <HI>Cad∣mia</HI> grows in the Earth, and other Curiosities. This <HI>Mine</HI> having been wrought Three hundred years, and being one of the most remarkable
<PB N="185" REF="112"/>
of that kind, it may not be impertinent to set down some particulars concerning it. It is about eighteen or nineteen <HI>Fathoms</HI> deep, lying all open like a <HI>Chalk Mine,</HI> of an Oval Figure; they digg at present in se∣veral places, and the best <HI>Calmey</HI> lies between the <HI>Rocks,</HI> in the deepest part of the <HI>Mine:</HI> They have now found an excellent <HI>Vein</HI> so placed, of eleven or twelve Foot thick, which they digg out with <HI>Pick-axes,</HI> with some difficulty, by reason that the <HI>Lapis Calaminaris</HI> is very hard. The <HI>colour</HI> of this <HI>Stone</HI> is of a dark <HI>yellow</HI> and <HI>red,</HI> and hath <HI>Veins</HI> of <HI>natural Brimstone</HI> mixed thinly in it. The <HI>Veins</HI> of the <HI>Lapis Cala∣minaris,</HI> being so large, they follow them not only in one place, but digg over one anothers heads, and frame their work into the shape of large <HI>Stayrs,</HI> and one throws up what another diggs, and so upward till they lade the <HI>Carts</HI> with it. Some of the <HI>Cadmia</HI> is blackish and dark brown; and there are <HI>Fluores</HI> between the Cavities of the <HI>Stone</HI> handsomly figured, but most of a <HI>blackish colour.</HI> The <HI>works</HI> about the <HI>Mine</HI> the most remarkable, are these: 1. An <HI>Overshot-wheel</HI> in the Earth, which moves the <HI>Pumps</HI> to pump out the <HI>water;</HI> and this not placed in the <HI>Mine</HI> but on one side of it, and a <HI>passage</HI> cut out of the <HI>Mine</HI> to the bottom of it, by which the <HI>Mine</HI> is drained; and another <HI>passage</HI> or <HI>cuniculus,</HI> out of the place where the <HI>wheel</HI> is turned, which lets out the <HI>water</HI> which turns the <HI>wheel,</HI> and also the <HI>water</HI> which comes out of the <HI>Mine</HI> into the Neighbouring <HI>Valley.</HI> 2. The <HI>washing</HI> of the <HI>Ore</HI> or <HI>Stone,</HI> which they perform, as at other works, by letting the <HI>water</HI> over it, and stirring it; and this they do wheresoever they begin to work near the <HI>Superficies</HI> of the <HI>Earth,</HI> for there the <HI>Calmey</HI> is less, and more mixed with <HI>Clay</HI> and <HI>Earth:</HI> but the most remarkable <HI>work</HI> is the <HI>calcining</HI> of the <HI>Ore</HI> (for all our <HI>Lapis Calaminaris</HI> of the <HI>Shops</HI> is the <HI>calcined Calmey)</HI> and it is worth the seeing; for they place <HI>Faggots</HI> in a handsome order first, and cover a large round <HI>Area</HI> with them, of about Forty or Fifty yards <HI>Diameter,</HI> upon which they place <HI>Charcoal</HI> in as good an order, till all be covered and filled up a yard from the ground; then they place ranks of the largest <HI>Stones</HI> of <HI>Calmey,</HI> and after them smaller, till they have laid all on; and then by setting <HI>fire</HI> to the <HI>bottom,</HI> the <HI>fire</HI> comes to each <HI>stone,</HI> and all is handsomly <HI>calci∣ned.</HI> They make <HI>Calmey</HI> also about two <HI>English</HI> miles from <HI>Bleyberg</HI> in <HI>Carinthia,</HI> They make it after this manner, They take the <HI>Ore</HI> out of the <HI>Mine,</HI> sometimes they wash it, and sometimes not, they burn it as they do Rost. Then they take it, and beat it in pieces with a mallet; They choose the best of it, and throw away the dross, the whitest is commonly the best. From hence we went to <HI>Limburg,</HI> meeting with divers <HI>Souldiers</HI> upon the <HI>Road,</HI> who desired money of us, but did not at∣tempt any thing against us, we being many of us together in Compa∣ny.</P>

<P>This <HI>Fountain</HI> smells very strong of <HI>Brimstone,</HI> and causes <HI>vomiting</HI> in a great many, yet passes chiefly by <HI>Ʋrine,</HI> as they do all; and strikes a <HI>purple</HI> with <HI>Nut-galls</HI> more inclining to <HI>red,</HI> than the <HI>waters</HI> of <HI>Tunbridge.</HI> The <HI>Sediment</HI> is of a <HI>light blew</HI> in the <HI>Fountain,</HI> but of a <HI>dark, dirty red</HI> every where else.

<P>Being at the <HI>Spà,</HI> we visited <HI>Franchimont</HI> one Afternoon; passing through a thick <HI>Wood,</HI> there is an old Castle, and good <HI>Brimstone</HI> and<NOTE PLACE="marg">The making of <HI>Brimstone.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Vitriol works,</HI> the same <HI>Stone</HI> affording both; and I presume may also make the <HI>Spà-water</HI> under ground, or at least be a principal <HI>Ingredient</HI> in it. We saw the manner here how they melted, and cast their <HI>Brim∣stone</HI> first into great <HI>Pails,</HI> the florid and clear parts remaining at the top and middle, the thick and more obscure subsiding and adhering to the bottom and sides, and is that which is sold for <HI>Sulphur Vivum.</HI> We saw also the manner of casting the <HI>Brimstone</HI> into <HI>Rolls,</HI> or <HI>Magdaleons:</HI> And near unto this place a smoaking, burning, little <HI>Hill,</HI> which is thus caused: They throw out the burnt <HI>Pyrites,</HI> out of which <HI>Brimstone</HI> hath been distilled, and the <HI>Vitriol</HI> drawn out by infusion, upon this <HI>Hill;</HI> which consists all of the same matter, and ferments in time, grows hot, smoaks and burns perpetually, and withal drinks in a new <HI>Vitriol</HI> into its self.</P>
<P>From the <HI>Spà</HI> we crossed over to <HI>Frapont,</HI> a <HI>Village</HI> seated upon the pleasant River <HI>Ʋta,</HI> or <HI>Ourte,</HI> where we took Boat and went down a rapid <HI>Stream,</HI> yet one of the pleasantest I ever saw, winding and turning between many green Hills, in part of the <HI>Forest</HI> of <HI>Arduenna.</HI> We de∣scended afterwards thirty or forty small Falls in a long Boat made on purpose.

The delightful River <HI>Vesa,</HI> or the <HI>Wesdret,</HI> soon met us, and joyn∣ing together, we fell down with them into the <HI>Maes</HI> near <HI>Liege.</HI> Upon the Banks of these Rivers all the <HI>Arms, Guns,</HI> and other <HI>Instruments</HI> are made, for which the Country of <HI>Liege</HI> is remarkable.</P>

<P><HI>Speutus</HI> the Bishop of <HI>Liege,</HI> bought the Principality of <HI>Liege</HI> of <HI>God∣frey</HI> of <HI>Bouillon,</HI> when he went to the <HI>Holy Land:</HI> And in the Treaty of <HI>Cambray,</HI> 1559. the possession of <HI>Bouillon,</HI> and precedency of Ti le, was granted to the Bishop of <HI>Liege,</HI> although at this time also the Houses of <HI>La Tour</HI> and <HI>Mark</HI> do bear the same.</P>
<P>Of the Parish Churches that of St. <HI>John,</HI> and of St. <HI>Servasius</HI> are fair. Of the Abbeys that of St. <HI>Jacob</HI> within the Town, and of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> built by Bishop <HI>Raginardus</HI> upon an Hill out of the Town, are noble. There is also a College of <HI>English</HI> Jesuites, well-seated upon a Hill, where the Garden is handsom, and the Dyals, made by <HI>Francis∣cus Linus,</HI> are worth the seeing: And an <HI>English</HI> Nunnery handsom∣ly built. In the Church of the <HI>Gulielmites,</HI> out of the Town, lies the Body of our famous Country-man Sir <HI>John Mandeville,</HI> who, after he had travelled through many parts, took an affection unto this place, and here passed the remainder of his life, and whose Epitaph, and some Rareties of his, are still to be seen.</P>
<P>Bishop <HI>Notger,</HI> who was consecrated by St. <HI>Gereon,</HI> Arch-bishop of <HI>Colen,</HI> and died in the year 1007. built the walls of this City, and be∣ing Tutor to <HI>Otho</HI> the third, he found means very much to beautifie it, to repair and build divers Churches, and endow them with rich Reve∣nues,

and let the River <HI>Maes</HI> into the Town, which before ran upon one side of it.</P>
<P>As their Churches are fair and numerous, soo are their Bells and Chimes remarkable. In the Cathedral of St. <HI>Lambert</HI> there are eight large Bells, and twelve lesser; and there is one so great, as it is said to require Twenty four men to ring it. In the Church of St. <HI>Paul</HI> the Bells and Chimes are considerable; as also at St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> and the <HI>crossed Friars.</HI> It is also an University, and was so famous in former Ages, that they still take notice that at one time there have been Nine Sons of Kings, Twenty four Dukes Sons, Twenty nine of Counts, be∣sides many of great Barons Students therein.</P>
<P>Their Speech here, as also at <HI>Spaw,</HI> is called <HI>Roman,</HI> and is a kind of old <HI>French,</HI> or Dialect of that Languag, a great part of which is made up of <HI>Latin,</HI> or <HI>Roman</HI> words: and they call the Neighbouring Lan∣guage of the <HI>Dutch, Tuiscon.</HI> But many speak very good <HI>French.</HI> They have some Vineyards affording a small Wine. The Hills about furnish them with Quarries of good Stone, and of several kinds They have also divers Mines and Minerals, and great quantity of Pit-coal for Fire, in some places fetched deep out of the Earth, in others nearer the Surface: and in one place I saw them beginning to dig where they im∣mediately found Coal. Their Pumps and Engines to draw out the water, are very considerable at these Mines; in some places moved by Wheels, at above a Furlongs distance, to which they are continued by strong Wood-work, which moves backwards and forwards continu∣ally.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cittadel</HI> stands upon a Hill, and is of great Strength; It was built to keep the City of <HI>Liege</HI> under Subjection. For 1649. there being some disturbances in the City, <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> the Elector of <HI>Colen,</HI> offering to come into the Town to appease it, was opposed by the Con∣sul, <HI>Jacobus Hennet,</HI> who was soon after surprized and beheaded toge∣ther with <HI>Bartholomaeus Rolandus;</HI> the Consul having sworn the E∣lector should never come in whilst he were alive. And the <HI>Cittadel</HI> soon after was ordered to be built. The Bridges are handsom: that over the great Stream of the <HI>Maes</HI> is very broad and fair, and hath large Arches. From hence we could read the Elector's name upon the Cittadel, <HI>Maximilianus,</HI> although it were at a very great distance, the Letters were so large.</P>
<P>From <HI>Liege</HI> we had a pleasant passage down the Water to <HI>Mae∣streicht,</HI> passing by <HI>Argentau,</HI> a Castle seated upon a high Rock on the right side of the River, belonging then to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> afterwards by <HI>Vichet</HI> in the half way, and then by <HI>Navagne,</HI> a strong Fort in the <HI>Maes,</HI> which commands the River, and at that time did the <HI>Spa∣niard</HI> service; then by pleasant Rocks on our left hand, wherein many Cuts and passages have been digged till we came in sight of <HI>Maestreicht.</HI></P>
<P>This Town having been a little before taken from the <HI>Ʋnited States</HI> by a sharp Siege, was full of <HI>French,</HI> and had a Garrison in it of about ten Thousand men; and in the <HI>Market-place</HI> stood about Two hun∣dred large Fieldpieces. We saw the places where they made their Batteries and their Mines, the Out-works were very numerous, and many of them undermined. Colonel <HI>Storff</HI> shew'd us a handsom Draught of all the Works, Approaches and Manner of taking of the Town.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">A noble <HI>Quar∣ry</HI> of Stone.</NOTE> About a quarter of a Mile out of the Town we went into the great Quarry of Stone, which is one of the noblest sure in the World.

The <HI>Floor</HI> all in a level, and the <HI>Roof</HI> in most places of the same height, and so much hath that uniform rule, which I suppose was set to those who first digged, and so hath successively been observed, added to the beauty of this place, that there is scarce any thing more noble. It put me in mind of the <HI>hundred chambers of Nero,</HI> which he caused to be made under Ground in the <HI>Rocks</HI> at <HI>Baiae.</HI> And the <HI>Water</HI> which we met with in one place, made me think of <HI>Nero</HI>'s admirable <HI>Fish-pond,</HI> built in the like manner within the <HI>Earth.</HI> We came out again near to a <HI>Convent</HI> upon the <HI>Banks</HI> of the <HI>River,</HI> and returned by water to <HI>Maestreicht.</HI></P>
<P>The next day we parted Company. Mr. <HI>Newton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Ettrick,</HI> Mr. <HI>Grove,</HI> Mr. <HI>Carlton,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Newcomb</HI> went for <HI>Aken</HI> and <HI>Colen;</HI> Mr. <HI>Bates</HI> and Mr. <HI>Daston</HI> went up the <HI>River</HI> again to <HI>Liege,</HI> at which place, staying a day or two to find a convenience to pass to <HI>Brussels,</HI> we were nobly entertained at a Dinner with <HI>Venison, Wild-boar,</HI> and other <HI>Dishes,</HI> by that worthy Person and Learned Mathematician <HI>Franciscus Slusius,</HI> one of the great <HI>Canons</HI> of <HI>Liege,</HI> who also continued his high <HI>Civilities</HI> to us to the last <HI>Minute</HI> we stayed in <HI>Town.</HI></P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Liege</HI> we soon came in sight of <HI>Tongres,</HI> or <HI>Tungrorum o∣pidum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tongres.</NOTE> the most ancient place in all these Countries. <HI>Ortelius</HI> would have it to be called of old <HI>Atuatuca:</HI> It was a strong hold before the coming of <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> into <HI>Gaul,</HI> and was afterwards made a <HI>Roman Station,</HI> and in process of time became so great, that <HI>Attila</HI> the <HI>Hun</HI> de∣stroyed an <HI>hundred Churches</HI> in it, it being at that time a <HI>Bishops See,</HI> which in the year 498 St. <HI>Servasius</HI> removed unto <HI>Maestreicht.</HI> Many old <HI>Coins</HI> and <HI>Antiquities</HI> are still found here; and part of an old <HI>Chap∣pel,</HI> said to be built by St. <HI>Maternus,</HI> Disciple to St. <HI>Peter,</HI> is still re∣maining. When the King of <HI>France</HI> made his great inroad into the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> 1672. he borrowed this Town of the Elector of <HI>Cologne,</HI> and then passed on to <HI>Maseick,</HI> where crossing the Country to the <HI>Rhine,</HI> by the sides of these great Rivers, <HI>Rhine</HI> and <HI>Maes,</HI> he made that notable <HI>Incursion,</HI> and quitted not <HI>Tongres</HI> till he had taken <HI>Mae∣streicht</HI> the year following. We dined this day at <HI>Borchloe,</HI> and lodg∣ed at St. <HI>Truyn,</HI> or St. <HI>Truden,</HI> a handsome little <HI>Town,</HI> so called from a <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>Abbey</HI> herein dedicated to that <HI>Saint.</HI></P>
<P>The next day we dined at <HI>Tienen,</HI> or <HI>Tilmont,</HI> on the little River <HI>Geet,</HI> once one of the chief Towns in <HI>Brabant,</HI> but long since decay∣ed. In these <HI>Plain Countries,</HI> in many places we saw small <HI>Hills,</HI> or <HI>Sepulchral Eminences</HI> of the <HI>Ground:</HI> And near unto the <HI>Walls</HI> of <HI>Tie∣nen,</HI> are three very remarkable ones, said to be the <HI>Tombs</HI> of great <HI>Com∣manders.</HI> In the Evening we came to <HI>Lovain.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lovain.</NOTE> <HI>Lovain</HI> is the chief <HI>City</HI> of that quarter of <HI>Brabant,</HI> which compre∣hendeth <HI>Arschot, Halen,</HI> and <HI>Judoigne;</HI> an ancient and large City, pleasantly seated upon the River <HI>Dele;</HI> it is of great <HI>Circuit,</HI> and the

<P>It is the great <HI>Ʋniversity</HI> of these parts, said to have had its beginning about 926. but endowed by <HI>John</HI> the Fourth, Duke of <HI>Brabant,</HI> and confirmed by Pope <HI>Martin</HI> the Fifth, 1425.

The <HI>Ʋniversity</HI> is un∣der the Government of a <HI>Rector,</HI> who is in great esteem and honour a∣mong them. This <HI>Ʋniversity</HI> hath produced many Learned Men: But neither the <HI>Buildings</HI> of the <HI>Colleges,</HI> nor their <HI>Endowments</HI> do e∣qual those of our <HI>Ʋniversities,</HI> and the Situation thereof seems not to exceed that of <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>We travelled from hence to <HI>Brussels,</HI> being most part of the way in the sight of the very high Tower of the <HI>Church</HI> of St. <HI>Rombald</HI> at <HI>Mach∣lin.</HI></P>
<P>Count <HI>Monterei</HI> was then Governour of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> and re∣sided at <HI>Brussels,</HI> the ordinary Seat of the <HI>Governours</HI> of the <HI>Spanish Netherlands;</HI> which <HI>City</HI> he had taken care to fortifie, and to make it more tenable, if it should be attempted by the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Brussels</HI> we passed to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> where we were handsomely treated by Mr. <HI>Wauters</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hartop,</HI> and having visited some of our Friends, the next day we passed the River <HI>Schelde,</HI> and took Coach in the morning, travelling through a fruitful, plain, flat Country, set with rows of <HI>Trees</HI> in most places, and arrived in the evening at <HI>Ghent.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ghent.</NOTE> <HI>Gaunt, Gandavum,</HI> or <HI>Ghent,</HI> is esteemed to be the greatest <HI>City,</HI> not only of <HI>Flanders,</HI> but of all the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> and challenges a place amongst the greatest in <HI>Europe;</HI> but at present it decreases and de∣cays rather than encreases. And if <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth were now alive, he could not put <HI>Paris</HI> into his <HI>Gant,</HI> a greater Glove would not fit that City, which is so much increased since his time. In <HI>Ghent</HI> are many noble <HI>Convents,</HI> among which the <HI>Jesuites</HI> is one of the fairest: There is a <HI>Cloister</HI> also of <HI>English Nuns.</HI> The <HI>Cathedral</HI> is stately, and the <HI>Tower</HI> belonging to it being very high, gives a prospect of a pleasant and fruitful Country round about it. There are divers <HI>Piazza's,</HI> large and fair; in one of which stands a large gilded <HI>Statua</HI> of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, Emperor and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who was born in this City. The whole <HI>Town</HI> is generally well built, and the <HI>Streets</HI> are fair and clean.

a Regular Figure, yet not so convenient as those of latter days, since that Art hath been improved.</P>
<P>From <HI>Ghent</HI> we passed by water about Twenty <HI>English</HI> miles to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bruges.</NOTE> <HI>Bruges,</HI> a very elegant large City, and formerly a place of very great Trade, being within three Leagues of the Sea; so that from the tops of their highest <HI>Buildings,</HI> the Ships under Sail are visible, and at the same time a Fleet of Ships, and a large Territory of a fruitful, pleasant Country, comes under your eye. It is fortified with Works of <HI>Earth</HI> and deep <HI>Ditches.</HI> The <HI>Convents</HI> are numerous: The artificial Cuts of <HI>Water</HI> from this Town to all places, makes it of easie access; and though it hath no <HI>Port,</HI> the <HI>Passage</HI> from hence to <HI>Ostend</HI> by <HI>water</HI> is short: And they are at present upon a Design of bringing Ships up to this <HI>City.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ostend.</NOTE> <HI>Ostend</HI> is about Ten <HI>English</HI> miles from <HI>Bruges,</HI> seated upon the waves of the <HI>German</HI> Ocean, which wash it continually on one side: And they have now contrived it so, as to let the Sea in almost round the Town for a great space, whereby it is become much more strong and defensible than before. For when I looked upon it, and considered what it was when it was besieged by Arch-duke <HI>Albertus,</HI> and taken by Marquiss <HI>Ambrosius Spinola,</HI> 1604. with an honourable Surrender af∣ter three years Siege, I cannot but ascribe very much unto their Sup∣plies from <HI>England,</HI> and the obstinate Valour of the Defendants, espe∣cially the <HI>English</HI> under Sir <HI>Francis Vere. Sluys</HI> being in the hands of the <HI>States</HI> of the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces,</HI> and <HI>Dunkirk</HI> under the <HI>French.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> possess no other <HI>Port</HI> in <HI>Flanders</HI> but this and <HI>Newport;</HI> and this being the most considerable they are now making the <HI>Haven</HI> large, and are upon a considerable Work in order to the carrying of their Ships over into that Cut which goes from <HI>Ostend</HI> to <HI>Bruges,</HI> out of their Harbour, by the means of a very great <HI>Lock</HI> or Receptacle of <HI>Water,</HI> which is to communicate with both; which, when it is finish∣ed, may be very advantageous to the <HI>Traffick,</HI> of the <HI>Spanish Nether∣lands.</HI> This <HI>Town</HI> stands very low, but the <HI>Streets</HI> are straight, large, and uniform</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Newport.</NOTE> From hence I went all along upon the Sea-shoar to <HI>Newport,</HI> a hand∣som <HI>Town,</HI> with large fair <HI>Streets,</HI> but low built. There were then a great number of small Ships in the <HI>Harbour.</HI> This place is famous for the Battel of <HI>Newport,</HI> fought here by <HI>Albertus,</HI> and Count <HI>Maurice,</HI> wherein the <HI>Spanish</HI> Forces lost the day, and much of the honour of the Field was due unto the <HI>English</HI> under Sir <HI>Francis Vere;</HI> since which time, although there hath been much bloud shed in these Quarters, yet there hath not been so considerable a Battel ever since, although the <HI>English</HI> had also the fortune to do great Service hereabout at a fight called the Battel of the <HI>Sandhils,</HI> when a part of the Army of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> which besieged <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> fought with the <HI>Spanish</HI> Forces by <HI>Newport,</HI> and overthrew them.</P>
<P>From <HI>Newport</HI> we put to Sea, sailing out of the Harbour, and inten∣ding for <HI>England;</HI> but the wind being very high and contrary, after having been at Sea all the night, and had leisure to take notice of the great number of <HI>Sands</HI> upon that Coast, in the morning we put into <HI>Mardike,</HI> where at present there is only a Fort of Wood just above the High-water mark, with some few Guns mounted.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dunkirk.</NOTE> <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> is much increased of late, and the King of <HI>France</HI> hath not spared money, to render it considerably strong.

And every <HI>Bastion</HI> is sprucely kept and covered with∣in with green Turf. Beyond the old Wall of the Town, there are now great Works drawn, which encompass so large a space of Ground, that the Town is made bigger by half: And in this part stands the <HI>English</HI> Nunnery, and many handsom Buildings. The new Fortifications are very large; and the Bastion towards the North the most stately. The Port is large and capable of receiving a gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at number of Ships, but at low water it is almost dry; and there are so many Sands before it, that at that time the Sea comes not in any depth within a mile of it.</P>

<HEAD>A JOURNEY FROM VENICE TO GENOA.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Travelled some years since, between <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Genoa,</HI> through many Countries of early Civility, seated in the middle of the temperate Zone, in a fruitful and happy Climate; affording plentifully all Necessaries for Life; and through Countries which have not only been considerable for their copious production of Corn, Fruit, Silk, Wine and Oyl, but also for having been very fortunate in all Ages, for bringing into the World Persons of great Fame and Renown, who have rendred this Tract of Earth more than ordinarily remarkable for great Actions in all times. The memory of which is still preserved not only in their Writings, but also in their splendid Buildings, and Antiquities; though no parts have tasted more deeply of the dangerous variety of fortune, these having suffered the frequent Incursions of many fierce and warlike Nations. Having therefore formerly enjoyed such variety of observable Objects, I could not remember this Journey without some considerable satisfaction, es∣pecially having at the same time had the good luck to travel a great part of it with my worthy friends, Sir <HI>William Trumbull,</HI> Mr. <HI>Soames,</HI> Dr. <HI>Palman,</HI> Dr. <HI>James,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Dashwood,</HI> which makes me bold, upon the opportunity of this second Impression, to add further this short Account.</P>
<P>We passed from <HI>Venice</HI> to <HI>Padoa</HI> by water up the stream of the pleasant River <HI>Brent,</HI> having all day long Houses of Pleasure, and well built Palaces on each hand of us. We entered this River near <HI>Lizafu∣sina,</HI> five Miles from <HI>Venice;</HI> where formerly a Wheel, or Engine was placed, to convey the Vessels into the River. The <HI>Venetians</HI> having long since stopped up the entrance of the <HI>Brenta,</HI> lest that by the con∣tinual Descent of the Water, the Stream, and Channel might be di∣minished, lost, or altered; and the passages for their Vessels rendred dangerous, or inconvenient; but this is otherwise contrived at present, and four large Locks or <HI>Sostegni</HI> are made use of, both to keep up the water, and to facilitate the passage of the Vessels. These are placed at
<PB N="195" REF="117"/>
<HI>Stra, Dolo, Mira,</HI> and <HI>Moranzan,</HI> and are very remarkable, considering that the River in these places is locked up, and the Vessels which are to pass are brought in between great Gates; and the water let in or out, as they have occasion to pass up or down the River.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Padoa.</NOTE> The landing-place at <HI>Padoa</HI> is handsomly set off with stone steps, continued for a long space, along the side of the River, after the manner of the landing-place at <HI>Ghent,</HI> and some other elegant Cities of the <HI>Low Countries.</HI> The outward Wall is strong, being well fortified according to the Modern Rules of Fortification▪ in the time of <HI>Leonar∣do Loredaro,</HI> Duke of <HI>Venice;</HI> and to render it more strong, the Ri∣vers of <HI>Brenta</HI> and <HI>Bacchiglione</HI> are let into the Town Ditch. The in∣ward Wall is now most considerable for its Antiquity, and for retain∣ing the name of its Founder; it being still called <HI>Antenor</HI>'s Wall: It contains a far less space of ground than the former, <HI>Padoa</HI> being built in this respect like to the City of <HI>Aix la Chapelle,</HI> or <HI>Aken,</HI> having own Town within another.</P>
<P>That <HI>Patavium,</HI> or <HI>Padoa</HI> is one of the oldest Cities of <HI>Europe,</HI> built presently after the <HI>Trojan</HI> War, is confessed by Ancient Writers; and so generally believed of old, that <HI>Livy</HI> lays it down for the Ground∣work of his History; beginning in this manner, <HI>Jam primum omnium satis constat, Troja capta,</HI> &amp;c. i. e.</P>
<P>In the first place it is sufficiently manifest that <HI>Troy</HI> being taken, the <HI>Grecians</HI> executed the utmost of their rage upon the <HI>Trojans, Aeneas</HI> and <HI>Antenor</HI> only excepted, by reason of their ancient friendship with the <HI>Greeks;</HI> and in respect that they had always endeavoured to make Peace, and restore <HI>Helena.</HI> After various fortunes, <HI>Antenor</HI> brought a great Number of the <HI>Heneti,</HI> who having lost their King, <HI>Pylemon</HI> at the Wars of <HI>Troy,</HI> and being driven out of <HI>Paphlagonia,</HI> by a Fa∣ction, were now seeking new Seats and a Captain to lead them; and came along with them to the bottom of the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Gulf, drove out the <HI>Eugenians</HI> who inhabited between the Sea and <HI>Alpes,</HI> and establish∣ed the <HI>Trojans</HI> and the <HI>Heneti</HI> in those Countries.</P>
<P><HI>Martial</HI> also saluting <HI>Flaccus,</HI> a <HI>Padoan</HI> Poet, calls him,

<P>And that you may more firmly give credit to it, you may further also have the authority of a Goddess for it; for <HI>Venus</HI> is introduced expostulating in these terms with <HI>Jupiter,</HI> in the behalf of <HI>Aeneas.</HI></P>

<P>In those days when the art of Navigation was but in its infancy, and the Mariners very unwillingly parted with the sight of land, <HI>Antenor</HI> was forced to keep close, and creep along the Coast of <HI>Peloponnesus,</HI> and <HI>Epirus,</HI> and then sail by the <HI>Illyrian,</HI> and <HI>Liburnian</HI> Shoars, which are very uneven and troublesom to deal with, being full of Creeks, un∣safe Bays, and Rocks; besides very many Islands of various shapes▪ Whereas if he had crossed over to the <HI>Italian</HI> coast, he had had a nearer voyage, and sayled with pleasure all along an even, bold, brave shoar.</P>
<P>The people of <HI>Padoa,</HI> are well pleased with the thoughts of their An∣cient founders and Progenitors, and they still preserve the tomb of <HI>An∣tenor,</HI> near to which at present stands the Church of Saint <HI>Lawrence▪</HI> and in their publick shows they will still be representing something of <HI>Troy,</HI> and the old <HI>Trojans,</HI> and in one place I saw a horse of wood, a∣bout twenty foot high in imitation of the old <HI>Trojan</HI> horse; but, I suppose, nothing near so big as the first original: Yet when I consider that above eleven hundred years after the destruction of <HI>Troy,</HI> when Towns and Buildings were very much amplified and improved, <HI>Pom∣pey</HI> coming in Triumph, could not enter even the great Triumphal gates of <HI>Rome</HI> it self in a chariot drawn by Elephants, an Animal that seldom or never comes to be so high as this Horse, it may well be sup∣posed that they could not have received, even this poor model of the first great one into the old town of <HI>Troy</HI> without pulling down their walls.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Padoa</HI> was always a friend to the <HI>Romans,</HI> and did them great service in their wars against the <HI>Galli, Senones,</HI> the <HI>Ʋmbrians, Boians, Insubres, Cimbrians</HI> and <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> and stuck close to their Interest till the time of the declination of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire; When <HI>Attila</HI> the powerful King of the <HI>Huns</HI> with fire and sword destroyed it; and when after divers years it was rebuilt by the favour of <HI>Narses,</HI> the Eunuch, General to the Emperor <HI>Justinian,</HI> it was again lamenta∣bly ruined by the <HI>Longobardian</HI> Princes, who by shooting arrows, with firebrands fixed to them, set the City on fire, and took it. But under the Empire of <HI>Charles</HI> the great, and his successors, it arose out of its ashes again, and flourished for a long time; being governed first by Consuls, and then by a Podesta, untill the time of their dreadful Ty∣rant <HI>Ezzellin,</HI> who harrassed, banished, tormented, and massacred the Inhabitants, cramming their own Wells within the City, full with their

This noble Family of the <HI>Carraresi,</HI> very powerful in these parts, came from their Castle of <HI>Bassano,</HI> and lived in <HI>Padoa▪</HI> where they became very considerable and siding with the Pope against the Emperor <HI>Frederick</HI> the second, they were driven out by <HI>Ezzellin,</HI> but when upon the successful attempts of the <HI>Roman</HI> Legate, <HI>Ansedin,</HI> a commander under <HI>Ezzellin,</HI> was overthrown, they were again restored, dignified, and established in the government of <HI>Padoa;</HI> which they possessed, with some variety of Fortune, from one to ano∣ther in their own Family, for about an hundred Years, in the conclu∣sion of which, they were seized on by the <HI>Venetians,</HI> who thought fit to put <HI>Francisco Novello,</HI> and his Sons to death in the year 1405. And after this manner, by having totally extinguished the noble Family of the <HI>Carraresi,</HI> without fear of any further claim, or dispute, they possess∣ed themselves of the City of <HI>Padoa,</HI> and hold it in their hands to this day.</P>
<P>The Buildings at <HI>Padoa,</HI> both publick, and private, are very conside∣rable; for most of the City is built upon Arches, making handsom <HI>Portico</HI>'s or cloysters on each side of the street; after the manner of the houses in the Piazza of Convent Garden, which at all times afford a good defence against the Sun, and Rain, and many of the houses are painted on the outside, with very good History-Painting in <HI>Fresco;</HI> their Churches are fair, and divers well adorned; The Domo or Cathedral Church is large, seated near the middle of the City; endowed, and mightily enriched by the Emperor <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth; whose Empress <HI>Berta</HI> lies buried here.

Between the Pillars are carved the miracles of this Saint, who lies interred un∣der the Altar, upon which stand seven Figures made by <HI>Titian Aspetti,</HI> a good statuary of <HI>Padoa,</HI> and behind the Altar there is a most excel∣lent <HI>Basso relievo</HI> done by <HI>Sansovinus, Tullius Lomburdus,</HI> and <HI>Cam∣pagna Verone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sis.</HI> Over against the Chappel of St. <HI>Antonio</HI> stands the Chappel of Saint <HI>Faelix;</HI> and his tomb nobly wrought, with coloured marble, and the whole splendidly adorned, with the paintings of the highly celebrated <HI>Giotto.</HI> The chief Reliques in this Church are, the Tongue and Chin of St <HI>Antonio,</HI> a Cloth dipped in the blood of our Saviour, Three thorns of his Crown, and a piece of the wood of the
<PB N="198" REF="120"/>
Cross, some of the hair and milk of the blessed Virgin, and some of the blood of the marks of St. <HI>Francis.</HI> Before the Front of the Church there is a handsom brass Statue on Horse-back, representing the great <HI>Venetian</HI> General <HI>Gattemela.</HI> St. <HI>Ant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nio,</HI> lived six and thirty years, dy∣ed upon the thirteenth of <HI>June,</HI> 1231, and was canonized by Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> the ninth in the City of <HI>Spoleto,</HI> 1237.</P>
<P>The convent of the black Monks of St. <HI>Benedict</HI> may compare with most in <HI>Italy;</HI> and their Church dedicated to <HI>Santa Giustina,</HI> built by <HI>Palladio,</HI> is one of the fairest in <HI>Europe.</HI> Saint <HI>Giustina</HI> was a Virgin, and Martyr, daughter to <HI>Vitaliano</HI> of this City; she suffered Martyr∣dom in the time of <HI>Maximianus</HI> the Emperor. In this Church there are still preserved, as they say, the body of St. <HI>Luke,</HI> the Evangelist, of St. <HI>Matthias,</HI> the Apostle, of two of the Innocent Children, of <HI>Prosdochimus,</HI> the converter of these Countries to the Christian Faith, and first Bishop, of <HI>Padoa;</HI> of <HI>Maximus</HI> their second Bishop, and of <HI>Santa Giustina.</HI> The Front of this Church looks into a spacious place called <HI>Prato del∣la Valle,</HI> where the Gentlemen meet in their Coaches in the Evening, for their pleasure. In a handsom room or burying place on the South∣side of this Church is a round old red marble stone, upon which the heads of many Martyrs were cut off; and near to it a fine white mar∣ble Well, called <HI>Pozzo d' Martiro,</HI> or the <HI>Martyr</HI>'s Well, a place of great Devotion.</P>
<P>Where the Temple of <HI>Juno</HI> stood in old time, there is now built a handsom Church, dedicated to St. <HI>Augustin,</HI> wherein are divers Mo∣numents of the Family of <HI>Carrara,</HI> the Tomb of <HI>Charlotta,</HI> daughter to <HI>James</HI> King of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> and of <HI>Petrus Aponensis,</HI> a great Philosopher.</P>
<P><HI>Il Ponte Molino,</HI> where there are thirty Water-Mills together, and the <HI>Castello delle munitioni,</HI> both built by <HI>Ezzellin,</HI> are worth the see∣ing. <HI>La Corte del Capitanio</HI> is splendid, and was the Palace of the <HI>Carraresi.</HI> The <HI>Palazzo della Regione,</HI> where the Courts of Justice are held, is very large, beautiful, and highly considerable, both without, and within; being built of Marble with rows of Pillars without, and within there are Heads and Inscriptions for divers eminent Persons of this City; the length hereof is 256 Foot, and the breadth 86 without any Pillar or support in the middle.</P>
<P>The University of <HI>Padoa,</HI> was founded in the Year 1220. by the Emperor <HI>Frederick</HI> the Second; and the Schools are fair, and large, containing one Quadrangle, with rows of Pillars above and below; and besides handsom Schools on every side, there is a very convenient Anatomical Theater▪ The Physick Garden is large, of a round Figure, walled about, and well stored with Plants. The Prefects hereof have been Men of Note, as <HI>Aloysius Mundella, Aloysius Anguillara, Melchior Guilandinus, Jacobus Antonius Cortusus, Prosper Alpinus,</HI> and <HI>Joannes Ves∣lingius.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Arena,</HI> or old Amphitheater at <HI>Padoa,</HI> is an Antiquity very remarkable; and the remains of some of the Arches are to be seen still in the Gardens backward; but the <HI>Arena</HI> it self, and the whole <HI>Podium,</HI> are preserved intire, free, and empty: And at one end thereof, there is built a handsom Palace, the Front of which looks directly into the open Amphitheater, and is a portion of an Oval Figure, and the whole <HI>area,</HI> or <HI>Arena</HI> of the Amphitheater serves for the court to it, in such manner, that the entrance being now at the end, directly oppo∣site
<PB N="199" REF="120"/>
to the house, the handsome prospect of it, and the clear Avenue to it, is extraordinarily surprizing, and extreamly noble, and I could not ima∣gine that any Gentleman would ever desire to have a fairer Court-yard to his house, than the spacious plain <HI>Arena</HI> of an old Roman Amphithea∣ter, nor a better Wall than a high intire handsom <HI>Podium,</HI> the like to which perhaps is not at this day any where else to be seen. And I must freely confess, That of the Remains and Ruines of twelve old Amphitheaters, which I have seen my self, I have not met with any one that comes near it; for in the Amphitheater at <HI>Douè</HI> in <HI>Poictou,</HI> which is cut out of a Rock, and being of a smaller dimension, and part of the bottom being filled up, there is no visible beauty of the <HI>Podiam,</HI> the like may be said also of that at <HI>Nizza,</HI> near the river <HI>Varus,</HI> and that at <HI>Puzzuolo.</HI> That at <HI>Nismes</HI> is filled up with dwelling houses, in such manner that the upper seats only are distinctly visible. The Amphitheaters of <HI>Bourde∣aux, Xainctes, Arles, Garigliano,</HI> that at <HI>Rome</HI> near to the Church of <HI>Santa Croce</HI> in <HI>Gierusalemme,</HI> and others are at present so much ruined, that nothing of this nature distinguishable is to be expected; nay even about the <HI>Arena</HI> at <HI>Verona,</HI> and the great <HI>Colisseo,</HI> or <HI>Domitian</HI>'s Am∣phitheater at <HI>Rome,</HI> the ground is now risen so high, that the <HI>Podi∣um</HI> is at present either buried, or disfigured. But as the <HI>Arena</HI> at <HI>Pa∣doa</HI> is clear, and evident in this part; so is it wanting in all the rest: and he that desires at this day to view all the Parts of an Amphithea∣ter, must not see one, but many; and by joyning them together in his thoughts he may collect the figure, proportion, and dimensions of this sumptuous sort of building of the old <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>From the Walls of <HI>Padoa,</HI> there is a pleasant Prospect of a plain Country to the North, East, and South; and of the <HI>Euganean</HI> Hills to the West, which supply the Town with variety of Plants, and great Number of Vipers. At a few Miles distance are the hot Baths of <HI>Abano,</HI> and the Mineral drinking Waters of <HI>Monte Ortone,</HI> as also <HI>Mar∣chese Obizzi</HI>'s Country House, which we saw with great delight, it be∣ing well designed, and accommodated with a good Armory, a Theater for Comedies, handsom Stables, and a Tennis-court▪ and nobly paint∣ed both within, and without, by that great Master, <HI>Paulo Veronese.</HI></P>
<P>Leaving the Ancient City of <HI>Padoa,</HI> in the Two Thousand, Seven Hundred and Eighty Fifth Year after its first Foundation, according to their own compute, and Travelling Eighteen Miles through a fruitful Country, we came to the pleasant City of <HI>Vicenza;</HI> a place worth the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vicenza▪</NOTE> seeing, by reason that <HI>Palladius</HI> hath here shown great skill in Archi∣tecture in his <HI>Rotunda,</HI> in imitation of the <HI>Pantheon▪</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> in his Theater exactly proportioned to the strict Rules of Building, and other fair Houses in the Town. There are also two Arches worth the ob∣serving, one near the Gate, behind which there is a noble ascent up to <HI>Santa Maria del Monte,</HI> and another in <HI>campo Martio.</HI> This City is filled with Nobility and Gentry, and drives a great Trade in making Silk, but is not of any considerable Strength.</P>
<P>The <HI>Piazza della Signoria</HI> is as beautiful a place as can well be con∣trived, and besides its being large enough to receive all the Gentry in an Evening, and to have Tilting, and Turnaments performed in it, it is beautified with the exquisite Front of the <HI>Palazzo della Ragione,</HI> of the <HI>Capitanio</HI>'s Palace, and also with the Buildings of the <HI>Monte della Pie∣tà,</HI> where Money is lent out without use to the poorer sort.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="121"/>
<HI>Vicenza</HI> is a rich Bishoprick esteemed at twelve thousand Ducats a Year, and in the Cathedral, besides other Reliques, are preserved the Bodies of <HI>Carpophorus,</HI> and <HI>Leontius,</HI> Martyrs of this Place; but the most celebrated Relique of all, is kept in the Church of the <HI>Santa Corona,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Dominicans:</HI> It is one of the Thorns of our Saviour's Crown, given by Saint <HI>Lewis,</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> to <HI>Bartolo∣meo Breganza,</HI> a native and Bishop of <HI>Vicenza.</HI></P>
<P>The City of <HI>Vicenza,</HI> or <HI>Vicentia,</HI> is watered with the River <HI>Bac∣chiglione,</HI> and <HI>Rerone,</HI> or <HI>Eretenus,</HI> besides two other pretty Streams called the <HI>Astichello,</HI> and <HI>Seriola,</HI> which highly confer to its delightful Situ∣ation, and Convenience: but by reason that there are divers Hills very near, it can never be made strong, or able to make any signifi∣cant Resistance; and to speak the truth, it hath really been forced so many times, by every next bold Intruder, that few Cities, of this beau∣ty, and perfection, have been oftner ravished. It is thought to have been built by the <HI>Galli Senones,</HI> in the time of <HI>Tarquinius Priscus;</HI> but most Authors reckon it to be more Ancient, and will have it to be one of the twelve Cities built beyond the <HI>Apennines,</HI> by the old <HI>Tus∣cans;</HI> and that the <HI>Gauls</HI> possessed it not, till the <HI>Tuscans</HI> were driven out. These in process of time yielded it to the <HI>Romans,</HI> who enjoyed it long, even till the coming of <HI>Attila</HI> the <HI>Hun,</HI> who notably sack∣ed, and plundered it. The next to these that were Lords and Masters of <HI>Vicenza,</HI> were the <HI>Ostrogoths;</HI> and after them the <HI>Lombards:</HI> Till the time that <HI>Desiderius,</HI> the last of the <HI>Lombardian</HI> Kings, having left his son <HI>Aldigier</HI> in this City, was taken prisoner by <HI>Charles</HI> the great; and when it had served <HI>Charlemaigne,</HI> and his Successors with various fortune, in time it recovered its Liberty, and set up for a free City; till the Emperor <HI>Frederick</HI> coming upon it of a sudden, took, and burnt it. Next to him <HI>Ezzellin</HI> ruled over it; then the <HI>Padoans;</HI> then <HI>Masti∣no della Scala</HI> first <HI>Signore di Verona,</HI> and his Family after him, till <HI>Gio∣vanni Galeazzo Visconte,</HI> the first Duke of <HI>Milan,</HI> seized upon it, whose Dutchess <HI>Catharina,</HI> after the death of her husband, set them again at Liberty, and absolved them from their Oath of Allegiance, when upon Various Consultations in what manner they should govern themselves for the future and whether or no, they should unite with the <HI>Swiz∣zers; Henrico Caprasavio</HI>'s Party prevailed, who persuaded them to give themselves Voluntarily to the <HI>Venetian;</HI> by means of which free consent of their's, at last they enjoy at present greater immunities, and privileges than most of their neighbouring Cities.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Verona.</NOTE> From <HI>Vicenza</HI> we went to <HI>Verona,</HI> a noble, ancient, spacious City, of about six Miles round, well built, and now handsomly fortified by the <HI>Vene∣tians</HI> with great <HI>Bastions.</HI> It hath three Castles, or Forts; two upon the hill, and one by the River side; many ancient and many hand∣som Churches, stately Convents and Buildings, both publick and private, and is very well watered with the pleasant River <HI>Aiche</HI> or <HI>Etshe, Athe∣sis, Adige,</HI> or <HI>Adice.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Athesis.</NOTE> The River <HI>Athesis</HI> is a noble River, which arising above in the high <HI>Rhoetian Alpes</HI> and passing all along through the <HI>Vallis Venu∣sta,</HI> comes rouling down by <HI>Trent,</HI> and then winds, and turns, within the City of <HI>Verona;</HI> and afterwards, passing through the Fens near the <HI>l'o,</HI> enters the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea; and many Authors report, That the great Incursion of the <HI>Cimbrians,</HI> was made by the

where there was space enough for both Parties to show their valour; and to determine this Controversy in a fair, and open field; and where he gave a total overthrow to one of the greatest Armies per∣haps that ever invaded <HI>Italy;</HI> and hereby it seems to me, that this great drove of <HI>Cimbrians,</HI> or a good part of them, passed over Mount <HI>Sam∣pion,</HI> or <HI>Mons Sempronius;</HI> from which mountain the River <HI>Atiso</HI> takes its rise; and the Description of the vast Precipices, and sliding down in their Shields, as it were <HI>a la ramasse,</HI> is by no means agreeable, nor can it any ways be allowed for a tolerable Delineation of the passage into <HI>Italy</HI> by <HI>Trent,</HI> where the road doth no where lye over any such vast Mountain; but the terrible description by Mr <HI>Raymund,</HI> and Mr <HI>Lassels,</HI> of the bad way, and ill passage between <HI>Briga,</HI> and <HI>Domo,</HI> over Mount <HI>Sampion</HI> is very suitable to the ancient account.</P>
<P>As the pleasant River <HI>Athesis</HI> is very serviceable to <HI>Verona,</HI> so the four handsom Bridges over it, in this Town, are both useful, and orna∣mental; and the Walls about it, in a great measure, remarkable; though <HI>Verona</HI> being now very ancient, there is no good account at this day, to be found; who was the founder of them, or by whom, or at what time, they were first built, it is manifest however, that they long since did good service, and that in the civil wars of the <HI>Romans,</HI> between <HI>Caesar,</HI> and <HI>Pompey; Augustus,</HI> and <HI>Antonius; Vitellius,</HI> and <HI>Vespasian; Severus,</HI> and <HI>Julian;</HI> and others; this was a considerable place of strength, and sided with <HI>Caesar</HI> against <HI>Pompey,</HI> took <HI>Augustus</HI>'s part against <HI>Marcus Antonius,</HI> was for <HI>Vitellius</HI> against <HI>Vespasian,</HI> &amp; long after held out for some time for <HI>Maxentius</HI> against <HI>Constantine</HI> the great. The Emperor <HI>Gallienus</HI> took such particular care in fortifying <HI>Verona,</HI> that he left his name to the Town, and divers inscriptions upon the wall; for the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire being much divided in his time, and the force of the foreign Nations encreasing in many parts, he expresly commanded, to render the walls of this place strong, which being feated in the jaws of the <HI>Alpes,</HI> was more likely to be swallowed first by the Northern Nations. <HI>Theodoricus Amalus,</HI> that great Conqueror, and excellent King of the <HI>Goths</HI> was in succeeding times, marvellously pleased with <HI>Verona,</HI> amplified and adorned it, rebuilt and fortified its walls, which were rendred, notwithstanding, in after ages, more con∣siderable, by the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the great, and his Son, King <HI>Pippin;</HI> who made this the head City of <HI>Italy.</HI> In latter times, <HI>Albertus Sca∣liger,</HI> brother to <HI>Mastinus Scaliger,</HI> the first Soveraign Lord of <HI>Verona,</HI> and his Son, <HI>Canis Grandis</HI> more fully enlarged and fortified <HI>Verona,</HI> against the Incursions of the <HI>Germans:</HI> And the <HI>Venetians,</HI> last of all have built large Bastions about itstrongly faced with Brick.</P>
<P>The City within is convenient and beautiful, the Piazza a hand∣some long Square, the Streets large, and the Town being built part up∣on the Plain, and part upon Hills, makes the variety of the Pros∣pect more pleasing, looking somewhat like the beautiful City of <HI>Lyon</HI> in <HI>France.</HI> There are many good Houses; <HI>Conte Augustino Giusto</HI>'s Pa∣lace is particularly fair, and his Gardens delightful, in which I saw the <HI>Aloe</HI> Plant in Stem and Seed, the Stem or Stalk being about twenty Foot high; the Churches are beautiful, among which Saint <HI>Anastastus</HI> is one of the fairest; and the Cathedral and many others of them are antient, this City being converted to the Christian Faith by Saint <HI>Eu∣prepius,</HI> their first Bishop, Seventy years after Christ.

<P><HI>Verona</HI> is called <HI>Verona Nobile,</HI> and <HI>Verona Antica,</HI> and very ancient it is without doubt; for <HI>Just in</HI> says expresly, That the old <HI>Gauls</HI> built <HI>Milan, Como, Breseia, Verona, Bergamo, Trent,</HI> and <HI>Vicenza;</HI> and <HI>Livy</HI> most particularly, That the <HI>Gauls</HI> possessed themselves of those places where <HI>Breseia</HI> and <HI>Verona</HI> stand at present, but our Modern <HI>Italian</HI> Writers who are very unwilling that these spruce, polite Cities should owe their beginning to any rough tramontane Nation, are very eager in asserting, That they were built long before that time by the ancient <HI>Tuscans,</HI> but allow that they were afterwards possessed, and en∣larged by the <HI>Gauls,</HI> and that <HI>Vera,</HI> a noble old <HI>Tuscan,</HI> laid the first Foundation of this place, and called it <HI>Verona,</HI> after his own Name. It was long after this, under the <HI>Romans,</HI> in the heighth and glory of their Empire; and in the declination of it, this City shifted indifferently, till <HI>Attila</HI> took and sacked it; and when divers others set themselves up for Emperors, and Sovereign Commanders, as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lybrius, Glycerius, Au∣gustulus</HI> and <HI>Odoacer,</HI> King of the <HI>Heruli,</HI> and <HI>Turingi,</HI> it served first one, and then another, till <HI>Zeno</HI> the Emperor, sent that renowned Christian Prince, <HI>Theodorick,</HI> King of the <HI>Goths,</HI> into <HI>Italy,</HI> who con∣quered and possessed it, as the due reward of his valour; and by this means <HI>Verona</HI> came to serve the Goths, till <HI>Totilas,</HI> and <HI>Tevas,</HI> the last of their Kings were overthrown and slain by <HI>Narses,</HI> the Eunuch, who not long after called in the <HI>Lombards,</HI> being disobliged by the Em∣press <HI>Sophia,</HI> who endeavoured much to have him recalled, instigated her husband, the Emperor <HI>Justinian,</HI> against him, and sent him word after all his glorious Victories, and Services for them, That she would make him come home, like an Eunuch as he was, and Spin amongst her Maids; to which <HI>Narses</HI> returned this Answer, That he did intend it, as soon as might be, and that he would Spin her such a Web, that she, nor all her Maids together should never be able to unra∣vel; and immediately sent to <HI>Alboinus,</HI> the Valiant King of the <HI>Lom∣bards,</HI> who had lately overthrown <HI>Cunimundas,</HI> King of the <HI>Gepidae,</HI> and had taken his fair daughter <HI>Rosamund</HI> to wife, but withal had Slain the King her Father, and made a drinking Cup of his Skull. <HI>Alboinus</HI> was at that time possessed of <HI>Pannonia;</HI> but upon the invitation of <HI>Narses</HI> came into <HI>Italy</HI> with his whole Force and Attendants, and took all the Country called formerly <HI>Gallia Cisalpina,</HI> and began the <HI>Longobardian</HI> Kingdom, which prevailed in <HI>Italy</HI> for about two hundred Years.

<P>Nor is it to be much admired, that the force of the, <HI>Rota,</HI> and, <HI>Axis,</HI> which is able to remove any thing, should be powerful enough to drive back a Lyon. This device, at present, being much improved at <HI>Florence,</HI> where they place a man within a Monstrous green Dra∣gon moved upon wheels, which runs upon the wild Beasts, and drives them back: and whilest the Lyons sometimes turn, and stare upon this formidable machine, the man within thrusts two lighted Torches, out of the eyes of the Dragon, able to out stare any Beast, and to shine more flaringly than the bright Golden <HI>Iris</HI> in the Lyons Eye. In the hunting and baiting of Lyons, in former ages, they made
<PB N="208" REF="127"/>
use of great Oval flat Shields, which covered their whole body; and in this posture came on unseen; and if the Lyon were still so bold, as to advance against this moving wood, as he would sometimes, and overthrow one of the hunters, yet still the Huntsman kept himself covered with his Shield, and the Lyon was satisfied with leaping upon him, and pawing the Shield, whilest the man laid in safety un∣der it. And the manner of this hunting of Lyons is finely expressed, in Painting, in the Sepulchre of the <HI>Nasonian</HI> Family, lately discover∣ed in the <HI>Campania di Roma,</HI> whereby we may understand in what high value, and delight, the Old <HI>Romans</HI> held these huntings and fight∣ings with Beasts, whilest they Painted them in their Tombs, to recre∣ate the Shades below, and thought them sports worthy to be exerci∣sed and continued in the <HI>Elysian</HI> fields. In another part of the same Sepulchre there is painted the manner of the hunting of Tigres which is performed by the huntsmen uniting their Shields together▪ and bear∣ing up against him, whilest one lifts up a lance above the Shields, and wounds the Beast, or else by placing a looking-glass in a wood, which the Tigre spying, comes to it, and as he regards, and admires his own shape in the glass, a Hunsman placed above, wounds him with a Spear or Javelin.</P>

<P>But the outside of the Amphitheater of <HI>Verona,</HI> was as splendid as the inside, though at present a Portion of it only remains, as much as between, <HI>O,</HI> and <HI>P.</HI> By this small part however the whole is easily known, especially in so uniform a building as this. The out∣side therefore being all of marble, about a hundred and twenty foot high, consisted of three rows of Pillars and Arches, one over another, which opened into large walks, and spacious <HI>Portico</HI>'s with∣in, quite round the Building; and above these three rows of Ar∣ches, there was a handsom wall with Windows over every Arch, and Pilasters over every Pillar beneath; each row consisted of seventy two Arches, and seventy two Pillars of a great height; the upper row moreover is said to have been adorned with excellent Statues. But the outside of the Amphitheater at <HI>Nismes,</HI> being the most entire of any now stand∣ing, I have also inserted a Cut of it, that nothing might be wanting to the clear understanding of the manner of these buildings: and as that at <HI>Verona,</HI> hath three rows of Pillars, and a wall above them, this at <HI>Nismes</HI> hath only two rows of Pillars on the outside, and the seats withinside reach up to the top of it, and it hath no Galleries above. To supply this Amphitheater at <HI>Nismes</HI> with water sufficient to repre∣sent naval fights therein, the great <HI>Pont du Gard</HI> was built, which supports an Aquaeduct passing from one Mountain to another, a Cut whereof is also inserted, it being one of the most magnificent <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquities now standing in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>These wonderful Structures were first raised by the <HI>Romans,</HI> for the more convenient exhibiting of Shows and Fights to the People; and these Fights were either between Beasts and Beasts, Men and Beasts, or between Men and Men. The Fights between Beasts and Beasts are still continued; for the Gentlemen of <HI>Verona</HI> take that care of this Ancient Venerable Building, that there is not at present one Stone wanting of all the Seats within; and when they would see any strange hunting, fighting, or baiting o.

But these Sports were pursued with much more eagerness in the time of the old <HI>Romans,</HI> who brought strange Beasts from all Parts of the known World to fight before them, in these publick places; in con∣sideration whereof, upon the successful Atchievements of <HI>Sylla</HI> in <HI>Afri∣ca.</HI> the People of <HI>Rome</HI> were not so much pleased with his making their inveterate Enemy King <HI>Jugurtha</HI> his Prisoner, as they were infinitely delighted with the thoughts of the great familiarity, that <HI>Sylla</HI> had with <HI>Bocchus,</HI> King of <HI>Gaetulia,</HI> whereby they hoped, that he might obtain most strange unheard of <HI>African</HI> Monsters of Beasts, to be shewn in their Amphitheaters; and <HI>Pompey</HI> the Great most wonderfully gratified the inclinations of his fellow Citizens, when he first brought a great <HI>Rhinoceros</HI> to <HI>Rome;</HI> After him <HI>Augustus Caesar</HI> brought another, and following Emperors the like. This Beast, as it is reported, performed strange things there; and when irritated, would with his great strong Horn, presently throw up all other combatant Beasts to the Skies, and a Bull could not toss up a Ball Higher than he would toss up Bulls and Bears together.</P>

<P>The Fights between Men and Beasts were more unequal for the most part performed by Slaves, Captives, and Condemned Persons, yet some of good quality have also polluted themselves with these Brutish Sports, and acquired the true title of <HI>Bestiarij.</HI> That which happened to <HI>Androdus</HI> a <HI>Dacian,</HI> upon this occasion is well known now, but was surprizing at first, who standing ready in the <HI>Arena,</HI> and having a Lyon let out upon him, received no hurt; for the Lyon came gently to him, caressed and fawned upon him, and he likewise stroaked, and made much of the Lyon; and after the loud shouts of the People, be∣ing asked how this came to pass, he let them know, That being with his Master in <HI>Africa,</HI> to get rid of his hard service, he had fled into a Cave, whither this Lyon came with a Splinter in his Foot, and held up his wounded Paw to him to cure; which having performed and free'd his Foot from the splinter and healed it, the Lyon kept him and provided meat for him three years, and when he came away the Lyon followed him so far, that he was also taken and brought to <HI>Rome,</HI> and that by the further cruelty of his old Master he was now condemned to the Beasts, where they found him; whereupon his liberty was granted him, and the Lyon given him for his pains, with which he afterwards got his li∣ving, every one being desirous to see the Lyon that was the mans Host, and the man that was the Lyons Surgeon.</P>
<P>The Fights between Men and Men, were of divers kinds, for they sometimes fought on Horse-back, as the <HI>Andabatae,</HI> sometimes in Cha∣riots, as the <HI>Essedarij,</HI> and sometimes in Ships and Vessels, and this ei∣ther in the Amphitheaters, (the <HI>Arena</HI> being filled with water) or in a Building made on purpose, called a <HI>Naumachia;</HI> or in artificial

Ponds, and cuts out of Rivers; and the Emperor <HI>Claudius</HI> exhibited a Naval Fight upon the <HI>Fucine</HI> Lake, the <HI>Lago di Celano,</HI> or <HI>lacus Fucinus,</HI> a days Journey from <HI>Rome,</HI> where at his first appearance both Fleets salu∣ted him with an <HI>Ave, Caesar, morituri te salutant.</HI></P>
<P>But the greatest number of their Fights was performed by <HI>Gladiators</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Retiarius.</NOTE> on foot, of which there were also divers forts; as first, the <HI>Retiarius,</HI> who was armed with a Trident in one hand, and held a Net in the other, with which he entangled, and caught his Enemy; or otherwise, if he missed of his foe, he then fled swistly away;

<L><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prud.</NOTE> Altius impresso dum palpitat ense Secutor.</L></Q>
<P>These fought, and followed after the <HI>Retiarii,</HI> and other Gladiators, with fierceness and courage, and were favoured by divers Emperors, who liked this way of fighting; and when five <HI>Retiarij</HI> had yielded to five <HI>Secutores,</HI> and thrown down their weapons, the Emperor <HI>Caligula,</HI> com∣manded the <HI>Secutores</HI> to kill them; which they did to the last man, who becoming desperate took up his fork again, and slew all the five conquering <HI>secutores,</HI> and this loss of his dear friends was bemoaned by the Emperor in a publick Edict, with the exclusion of those who en∣dured to see it, from being present, for the future at any sacred rite. But the Emperor <HI>Commodus</HI> not only encouraged these Gladiators, but took their parts in his own person also, and fought along with them in the <HI>Arena;</HI> and when the flattering <HI>Romans</HI> cryed him up for a <HI>Hercules,</HI> a <HI>Mars,</HI> and shouted out that he fought like a God of war, he thought that they mocked and laughed at him, and immediately cal∣led to his marine Legion, that were tending the Ropes and Sayl cloths, come down, and kill the Spectators.</P>
<P>Another order of Gladiators imitated the <HI>Thracians</HI> in their fights, and bearing a small <HI>Parmula,</HI> or little plain <HI>Thracian</HI> shield, but trusting chiefly to their broad strong Swords with their points turning upward, like the present <HI>Turkish,</HI> or <HI>Persian</HI> Cimitars. They were called <HI>Threces,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Threces.</NOTE> or <HI>Thraces,</HI> and were terrible slashing▪ cutting Swords-players, and de∣rived this custom, manner, and occasion of fight, from the old <HI>Thra∣cians;</HI> even before the time of <HI>Herodotus,</HI> when they fought with the same weapons for prizes and rewards at the suneral, and tombs of their great men in <HI>Thrace;</HI> and these Fencers fought either against one another or against other Gladiators.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Myrmillones.</NOTE> A <HI>Myrmillo</HI> was a notable Sword-player and fought after the <HI>Gal∣lick</HI> way, dopping, and squatting low and frisking about, and covering himself with his great oval shield, and had his head armed with a strong Helmet, upon the Crest of which was the Figure of a Fish; and when his Enemy lay bare, or gave any occasion of a thrust, he would leap up briskly of a sudden, and run him through and through with his sharp pointed Sword. Who could contrast with such a cun∣ning, strong, and active combatant?</P>
<Q><L>Quis Myrmilloni componitur aequimanus? Thrax.</L></Q>
<P>The <HI>Thracian</HI> fighter would often engage with him, and the <HI>Retia∣rius</HI> many a time, and would come up to him with his Net in his hand, singing this;
<Q><L>Non te peto, piscem peto,</L>
<L>Quid me fugis, Galle?</L></Q></P>
<P>Another sort of Gladiators were named <HI>Samnites,</HI> whose armour is described by <HI>Livy.</HI> Their shields were inlayed, engraven, and imbos∣sed with Silver, and with Gold: One end of their shield, with which they guarded their breast, was flat, broad, streight, and even; the other end next their shoulder, was narrower, that it might be turned and
<PB N="214" REF="134"/>
moved with more ease; besides which, they had a long strong Sword, a Breast-plate, a Helmet with Feathers upon the Crest, and a Boot upon their left leg. These Gladiators were in great request in <HI>Campania,</HI> from whence the <HI>Romans</HI> learned many of their Amphitheatrical sports, and exercises; and they fought against the <HI>Pinnirapi,</HI> and the <HI>Provo∣catores.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dimachari.</NOTE> Besides these, there were others called <HI>Dimachaeri</HI> who fought with<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laquearij.</NOTE> two Swords, and others named <HI>Laquearii,</HI> these were dangerous fellows that fought with Sword and Halter, and had two ways with them to entangle, and destroy their Enemies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Meridiani.</NOTE> The <HI>Meridiani</HI> were a bold desperate Crew, who came rushing into the Amphitheater at Noon, when the <HI>Gladiators</HI> had concluded, and the Spectators were dismissed, and with their drawn Swords ran at one another without Order, Art, or Armour, and scorning to make use of Head-pleces, Shields, and such like Hindrances and Delays of Death, butchered one another presently.</P>
<P>But that which is still more strange, the tender Female Sex was not exampted from these sharp, rude exercises.</P>
<Q><L><NOTE PLACE="marg">Statius.</NOTE> Hos inter fremitus novos{que} lusus</L>

<P>They picked out the most beautiful, comely, lovely young Women that could be found, and put them to School to a <HI>Lanista,</HI> or Master of Defence, to be instructed in the Art of Fighting; where a tender young Gentlewoman that had scarce strength enough to exercise at a carving School, must be fencing every Morning with a great Fellow, and be set such rude Lessons as these:</P>

<P>And that they generally fought after the manner of the <HI>Samnites</HI> we may learn from <HI>Juvenal,</HI> where he takes notice, what a fine Cre∣dit it would be for a man to cry out at a publick Sale of his Wives Goods; who gives most for my Wives Boots? who bids Money for her Corselet, Helmet, Gauntlets?</P>

<P>But <HI>Domitian</HI> the Emperor went still beyond this, when he set his Gladiators together in the night, and made his Dwarfs fight, those lit∣tle <HI>Pygmaean</HI> Creatures: But we need say no more of them, for it may be thought by some that

<P>The entrances into <HI>Mantua</HI> over the lake are made good by strong Causeys, of five or six hundred paces long, having Draw-bridges at each end; and that over which we passed, called <HI>Ponte di St. Giorgio,</HI> hath a covered Bridge for a great space together, and a Tower in the middle. The <HI>Ponte de' Molini</HI> hath twelve Mills in the Arches, called the twelve Apostles, which afford the Duke a considerable Reve∣nue. The Streets are large, strait, and clean. Here are eight Gates, eighteen Parishes, and forty Monasteries. The <HI>Domo</HI> or Cathedral is built after the design of <HI>Giulio Romano,</HI> the Roof of which is painted with Azure and Gold; in this Church they preserve the Body of St. <HI>Anselm,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Luca;</HI> in the Church of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> is the Body of St. <HI>Longinus</HI> the Martyr, together with some drops of the Blood of our Saviour, which are said to be brought hither by that holy man. The Duke's Palace is stately and magnificent, and was the best furnish∣ed of any in <HI>Italy,</HI> till the Imperial Army plundered it, in the time of the Emperor <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the Second, in the year 1630. There are three Suburbs which appear like to so many distinct little Towns, <HI>Porto Forteze, Borgo di St. Giorgio,</HI> and <HI>Il Te.</HI> The Duke hath also divers Country Houses, as that of <HI>Marmirola,</HI> in the way to <HI>Verona,</HI> which is nobly furnished, hath Royal Apartments, good Gardens, Fountains, and Water-works. <HI>La Favorita</HI> is upon the side of the Lake, and hath about a hundred Rooms in it. <HI>La Virgiliana</HI> is another pleasant Coun∣try House with a Farm adjoyning to it, called thus, by reason that it is near to the Village of <HI>Petola,</HI> formerly called <HI>Andes</HI> where <HI>Virgil</HI> was born.</P>

I had formerly been in whispering places at <HI>Padoa, Mont∣pellier,</HI> and elsewhere; but those were single ones, made by the contri∣vance of the roof, upon this rule, That the Angle of Incidence, is always equal to the Angle of Reflection, and the whole top of the room so proportioned as to reflect all to one point, that comes from another opposite to it; but these far exceed them all, being contrived with a double and cross Arch, and make a large double cross whispering place.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Borgo di Val∣le.</NOTE> <HI>Borgo,</HI> or <HI>Borgo di Valle</HI> is a walled Town at the upper end of this valley, upon the side of the hills, where we shew our bills of health, and where the Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> keeps a Garrison. The <HI>Banditi</HI> appear∣ing in these parts the day before, the Governor sent a guard of Mus∣queteers with us to convoy us with safety over the hills into the State of <HI>Genoa.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Apennine</HI> Mountains.</NOTE> The <HI>Apennine</HI> is a row of Mountains of many hundred miles long, beginning at the <HI>Alpes,</HI> continued from one end of <HI>Italy</HI> to the other, and ending by <HI>Reggio,</HI> or <HI>Rhegium</HI> upon the <HI>Sicilian</HI> Sea, and in some places are more than a hundred miles broad, and by this means take up the greatest part of <HI>Italy,</HI> and render it a Mountainous Country, and though there be many valleys between, yet the hills do really reach▪ and extend themselves from the <HI>Tyrrhene</HI> to the <HI>Adriatick,</HI> from the lower to the upper sea, conformable to the description of them by <HI>Lucan.</HI></P>

<P>And this makes the travelling in <HI>Italy</HI> to be generally on Horse∣back, or upon Mules; whereas in <HI>France</HI> one may travel five hun∣dred miles together in Coaches, and in <HI>Germany</HI> all over the Coun∣try; and if it were not for <HI>Campania foelix,</HI> and the great continued plain Country between the <HI>Alpes</HI> and <HI>Apennine, Italy</HI> could never make good the high Character it has.</P>
<P><HI>Ovid</HI> mentions the Airy <HI>Alpes,</HI> and cloudy <HI>Apennine,</HI> and most Mountains have clouds about them, and in the evening the Clouds, floating in the Air after Sun set slip away towards the next high hills, and take up their rest in the hollow spaces of the Mountains, and when the Sun rises next day, and warms the Air, the clouds dis∣lodge again, rise up, and wander through the Skies; but the <HI>Apenni∣nes</HI> are more cloudy generally than other hills, whether for having the Seas on both sides of them, or for other reasons, I leave to the more accurate searchers into nature to judge, and we have travelled for many days together in the Countries of the <HI>Apennine</HI> Mountains with the Clouds continually about us, either a little over us, under us, or passing through them, not without admirable variety of prospect and from the top of a Mountain to see a valley with Houses, and Towns in it, and then the clouds creeping over the next hill to co∣ver

the whole valley between them, and make it look like a lake, and the top of the clouds gently waving, and to describe the Suns, rising, and coming to shine upon the upper parts of them, and to beau∣ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie, and gild them all, is beyond the expression of words.</P>
<P><HI>Virgil</HI> naming the <HI>Apennines,</HI> ranks them with Mount <HI>Erix</HI> in <HI>Sici∣cy,</HI> and Mount <HI>Athos</HI> in <HI>Greece.</HI></P>

<P>And indeed many of the Peaks of the <HI>Apennines</HI> are very high, and some of them covered with snow; and others are rocky, but in gene∣ral they are earthy, muddy, or full of clay; whereby they stain and tincture the <HI>Tiber</HI> and many other Rivers which flow through them, and give an umber, brown, or dirty yellow colour to those streams, which being also for the most part very swift, the <HI>Apennine</HI> Rivers hereby lose much of their grace and beauty, and become also less serviceable; and to speak the truth, not navigable with any pleasure: And this tincture which is communicated to them is of so deep a Dye in many places, that it is not easily altered or diluted, and I have seen divers Rivers run down from the <HI>Apennine</HI> with that force into the <HI>Adriatick,</HI> that the stream or colour of them is perfectly distin∣guished a mile or two into the Sea, as if the Gulf of <HI>Venice</HI> were painted in those places with a streight yellow stroke for two miles together.</P>
<P>We were told that the name of the hill which we here passed o∣ver was called, <HI>The Mountain of the Holy Cross,</HI> but the Mountain of the Cross, <HI>La montagne de la croix,</HI> much spoken of in the South part of <HI>France</HI> is one of the great Hills in the maritime <HI>Alpes,</HI> in one of the passages from <HI>Provence</HI> into <HI>Italy.</HI> The highest Mountain in the <HI>Apennine</HI> that I passed over, between <HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>Loretto,</HI> was Mount <HI>Soma</HI> in <HI>Ʋmbra;</HI> and the passage which pleased me most, was in the road from <HI>Turin,</HI> between <HI>Otagio</HI> and <HI>Genoa;</HI> where after some diffi∣culty having got up to the top of the Mountains, we saw <HI>Genoa,</HI> and the beautiful suburbs of St. <HI>Pietro di Arena</HI> under us at nine miles di∣stance, and a vast tract of Sea before us, the Eastern Coast on the left hand, and the Western on the right, and descended by a broad way, and by large Windings and Turnings, upon the bare marble rock, meeting great numbers of Mules, and Mulets tossing up their Nets about their noses, which all together afforded an extraordinary pro∣spect. But this Mountain of the Holy Cross is not rocky but all green, and it being the latter end of <HI>April</HI> we descended with ease and pleasure, and a good part of the way upon the grass, till we came to the Sea-side in the Evening, to <HI>Sestri</HI> or <HI>Sestro</HI> called by <HI>Daute</HI> in his Purgatory, <HI>Sisteri,</HI> formerly <HI>Segesta,</HI> at present <HI>Sestri di Levante,</HI> to distinguish it from <HI>Sestri di ponente,</HI> between <HI>Genoa</HI> and <HI>Savona:</HI> for the whole Coast of <HI>Genoa</HI> being divided into the East and the West, that which lyes between <HI>Genoa</HI> and <HI>Legorn</HI> is called <HI>La Riviera di Levante,</HI> and that between <HI>Genoa,</HI> and <HI>Provence, La Riviera di Ponente.</HI></P>
